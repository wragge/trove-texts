THE RED PAGE
The Bulletin Zoo
IT is down in the regions of Lower
George-street, where the wild poul-
try poult, and the captive crow
laments, and the big snake reminds way-
back visitors of their familiar jim-jams—
it is down in that district of private
menageries that dower the locality with
the delicate yet haunting fragrance of a
fowl-yard in full blast, that The Bulletin
appropriately keeps its Zoo.
You want to see the animals ? Listen
to the showman:
“ This, ladies and gents, is the
Japanese monkey, discovered by the
Editor and ‘Hop.’ He wasn’t born,
nor grown, nor
imported : he
just happened.
And he seems
to have come
to stay. He is
a troublesome
beast, and
latterly has
had to be
kept in a
cage in ,
Norman
Lindsay’s
studio. He is fed on Bulletin edi-
torials, which makes him so wild One
day he escaped, in order to visit The
Daily Telegraph , which wants him for
a household pet; but the tame Australian
Bear, which in-
variably gam-
bols on the
Lindsay easel,
met him, and
the Jap Monk
decided that
some other day
would do just
as well for
hari-kiri. But
he ought to be
content, for in
Japan he had
no tail. The
Bulletin kindly
presented him
with an ap-
pendage, so that now there is no real
difficulty in distinguishing him from his
first owners.
“ Next him we have the stuffed
Soudan Donkey. He came from Egypt
with a picnic party. It is suspected,
that he was looted from Pharaoh. Like*
Pharaoh, the Soudan Donkey is now out
of action. Beside him is the stuffed
Soudan Goat. Both of these animals are
now dead. They were laughed out of
existence—a painful death, ladies, as
George Reid can tell you.
“ The Kiama Ghost, in the next cage,
is a Myth. (We charge sixpence extra
for Myths. Pay the boy at the door, and
be careful of your pockets.) The Kiama
Ghost began with Edinburgh’s visit to
Australia. When a lunatic attempted to
shoot Edinburgh at Clontarf, Parkes, in
a speech at Kiama, said the act was part
of a Fenian plot. He saw in it ‘ the
ghost of Fe-
nianism ’ ;
and there-
upon the
Myth rose
right up in
its shroud,
and he has
been myth-
ing ever
since. He
must not
be confused
with the
curious
Spruce
Myth in
fact, these
two are only on growling terms. Yes,
this is the Spruce Myth. Please don’t
prod him.
“ I want you to look carefully at the
boy, ladies and gents. He is .Hop’s
Under-study, and can’t help it. He was
born in a hurry. One day ‘ Hop ’ was
rushed to do a page in five and three-
quarter minutes, and as ‘ Hop ’ is a con-
scientious artist
—no, ladies, we
haven’t him on
exhibition : he
insisted on too
much salary—
he got his Un-
derstudy to do
it for him, and
allowed him to
sign his name.
And, since
then, in his
lunch-hours,
Hop’s Under-
study some-
times does a page for his master out of
sheer gratitude and half-a-crown.
“ Stand back, please! This is the cage
of rare canines, and one of them is very
fierce. That ferocious animal slavering
at your green hat, madam, is The Yellow
Pup. He was discovered running amok
on a Sydney ferry-boat one Patrick Day—
an astonished Methodist-looking mongrel
dyed yellow. He mangled every Roman
cat in sight. He is usually starved in
order to make him more carnivorous ; but
every Patrick Day he is allowed five cats.
Yes, Miss, except for his frenzy for
green, he is a well-behaved canine. The
only trouble he got into was the
Abigail case. During that trial his
conduct offended the Law, and The
Bulletin was forcibly taken off a
news-stand and haled before the Court
for contempt of green cats. The Full
Court spent the happiest day of its life
with every Judge reading the Woman’s
Letter out of his own Bulletin on the
bench. Since then, they have used noother.
“ That thin and pessimistic canine is
George Pile’s Dog. Once upon a time
George Pile (now extinct for all editorial
purposes) lived next door to the editor of
The Bulletin , and while, in the watches of
the night, the editor in his humpy was
writing articles in favor of Federation,
George Pile’s Dog, who was a howling
anti-Federationist, used to agitate the
moonlight. In fact, he made more noise
than a septic tank. So, next week George
Pile’s Dorg appeared in a Bulletin
editorial, and ever since he has been not
quite the same dog. In fact, he turned
into a scape-goat. He enabled The
Bulletin to say things about him that
would have been libellous if said about his
owner. This canine is a curiosity—the
only real anti-Federationist left.
“ Don’t crowd, please ! Yes, this is it,
Keep back, gents ! You can all see it
in turn. This is The Dry Dog. Those
sad, hopeless motions of his forelegs show
that he is still trying to learn to swim on
dry land. A nebulous individual named
George Reid (now extinct) was fond of
remarking that the only way to teach a
dog to swim was to throw it into Sydney
Harbor. He had humorously pretended
to give N.S.W. (a by-gone slab of this
continent,
in the Com-
a strange
Free Trade,
retaining
upon to-
wine, con-
sugar and
c o u t le-
Bulletin
George had
now merged
monwealth)
thing called
by carefully
the duties
bacco, beer,
fectionery,
other ac-
ments. The
asked why
not put
those dogs into the water. In particular,
it wanted to know why the Sugar Dog
was still a Dry Dog. It has been getting
dryer ever since.
“Yes, that vague and bulky thing loom-
ing at the back of the cage is the cele-
brated Yes-No. Extinct? Well, some
people say Y r es, others No. If you ask
it yourself, it will say both. Yes, ladies,
it is very fond of lollies.
“ This, gents, is one of our most popu-
lar exhibits. It is The Fat Man. You
can’t see him ? Yes. you can. If you
look carefully you will see a suggestion
of a silk hat, and a pair of boots on the
rim of that broad expanse. What looks
like the globe is really his stomach. You
seldom see anything of him but stomach.
Like Buddha, he has been contemplating
his stomach
so long that
he imagines
it is the
globe. You’ve
seen plenty
of him about,
eh ? Ah, yes;
but they’re
dying out.
We’re keep-
ing this one.
Soon he’ll be
the only one
left.
“ And here
we have our chief exhibit—The Little
Boy from Manly. He was cap-
tured at the time of the departure of
the Soudan Picnic. A patriotic fund
was raised to which citizens contributed
banjos, frying-pans, billiard-tables, chan-
deliers, condiments, corkscrews, lollies
and other indispensable ordnance stores.
To this fund ‘ A Little Boy from Manly ’
sent £l. He was at once captured by
‘ Hop, ’ and appeared in The Bulletin as
the representative of N.S.W. Later, he
grew into the re-
presentative of the
Commonwealth.
One of his most
celebrated ap-
pearances before
the public was
in a cartoon by
‘ Hop, ’ entitled
‘The Roll Call, 5
which represented
the return of the
Soudan picnic. The
Little Boy has
puzzled some people
by his quaint, early-
Victorian costume. He
wore those trousers simply
because ‘ Hop,’ in seeking
for a national type, took the
good little boy from recollections
o -
of Sanclford and Merton. The animal was
subsequently identified as a gentleman
who is now a partner in a well-known
firm of solicitors, which,
evidently out of grati-
tude, is now The Bul-
letin's solicitors. It is
rumored that The Little
Boy from Manly is
having two other cos-
tumes made—that of the
Generalissimo of the
National Guard, and (in
between whiles) Admiral
of the Australian Submarines.
“ And now we come to the Souter Cat.
But his owner will tell you about him.
He will allow no one to exhibit him but
himself. It is not out of kindness to
animals, but for the ‘screw.’”
“ Yes, he was a real cat, with white chest
and feet, just as I draw him ; but the grin ?
Oh, well that was his expression when he
saw my first attempt at sketching him.
‘' I had to draw a cat for a commercial
design, and found that I had left school
before I got to cats, so I sat down and
studied our Thomas Dark.
“Naturally, I simplified him as much as
possible, and m
about' three
weeks got so
i expert that I
could draw him
with one hand,
and then it
happened that
a sketch I was
doing for The
Bulletinneeded
a blob of black
to balance the
composition, so
—I put in the cat, and when the drawing
appeared several people talked. Some
thought it clever, others told me straight
that I ought to buy a camera. One bush-
man wrote to the paper and said he had
seen my cat often when he had the jim-
jams. ;
“ But mine was a real cat all right, and
came to our house a tiny kitten one New
Year’s Eve. That’s one of the dates when a
Scotsman suffers from enlargement of the
heart, so we christened the waif Thomas
Dark, and made him a member of the clan.
“ He was a very moral animal for nearly
three years, when we all went to the country
for a month, and let the family mansion to
strangers. One of the conditions of the
lease was that my cat was to be a star
boarder ; but when they handed the place
over to us at the end of the term there were
several things that were not there. One of
them was the cat.
“They assured me that he had just
stepped round the corner, and was expected
back any minute ; but it was nearly a month
later when one night what seemed to be a
black fur boa wrapped in barbed wire hit me
in the chest as I was turning in at the gate.
“ It was my cat —with a beery look in his
eyes and smelling like a dead blackfellow.
All the same, we were glad to have him back,
and while we were killing the
fatted calf for him he took
advantage of our pre-
occupation and ate the
canary.
‘ ‘ He had fallen from
grace.
“Hem ostly stayed
out o’ nights after
dtliafc, and the
fhbors began to
lose chickens. They said
my cat found them, but the
evidence was only circumstantial, and I
never convicted him. But a man two doors
from us did—with a shot gun, and the fol-
lowing week he was fined 10 bob for having
his fowl-yard in an insanitary condition ; so
the manes of my cat were appeased.
“ All that was feline of Thomas Dark
(felis Souterii Australiensis) rests under
a flame tree in my back garden, and every
year the red blooms blush for Thomas
Dark.”
NOSTALGIA.
I hate the bitter brilliance of the day ;
For with the patient night I go apart,
And shutting eagerly the sun away,
J look in Memory’’ s cold eyes of grey —
And I am back in London—with my heart.
And yet a shadowed fantasy does seem
1 hat bleak Embankment where one night we kissed.
Was that slow-writhing river Lethe's stream.
Where dead souls shivered on a shore of dream —
That night we walked in Chelsea with the mist?
And was it real, that winter evening's tramp,
Or but a story tiresomely retold,
When you held out your fingers in the damp
To warm them at a watchman’s midnight camp ?...
Ah, little fingers note for ever cold J
Your laugh is but an echo faintly heard ;
Your moon-white face I never more can see.
By misty veils my longing eyes are blurred :
For now between us walks a silent Third
In London—you and I . . . and Memory !

HIS Railway has two terminii, the Southern portion extending to Wallangarra on
the NS W border 233 miles, and the Western portion forking at Gowrie
Junction pursues a Western course to Cunnamulla 604 miles. The principal
towns traversed are Ipswich 24 miles, Laidley 51 miles, Gatton 61 miles, and
Toowoomba 101 miles; to the South we have Clifton 143 miles, Warwick 169 miles,
and Wallangarra 233 miles. To the West we have Dalby 153 miles, Roma
318 miles. Mitchell 372 miles, Charleville 483 miles, and Cunnamulla 604 miles.
The Branch Railways connected with the S. & W. system are the Fassifern Line —Ipswich to Dugandan 59 miles.
The Brisbane Valley Line—lpswich to Kannangur 83 miles. The Highfields Line —Toowoomba to Crows Nest 34 miles.
The Beauaraba Line—Wyreema to Pittsworth 16 miles. Hendon to Allora 4 miles. Warwick to Killarney 28 miles.
Warwick to Goondiwindi 125 miles, and Dalby to Bell 24 miles. Most of these Branch lines are through Agricultural
Districts. Some of the scenery is very fine —the Valley of the Lockyer, Darling Downs, the Condamine and Gowrie
Creek Valleys, and the immense plains of the Roma and Maranoa Districts are unsurpassed, for Agricultural purposes,
whilst the Pastoral Lands of the Mitchell and Warrego are among the best in the State.
tjVith a length of 397 miles, extends from Brisbane to Rockhampton, passing through
Gympie 106 miles, Maryborough 167 miles. Bundaberg 217 miles, Gladstone 328 miles.
(01
)R scenic beauty, portions of this line are second only to the Cairns line. There
are within 60 miles of the Metropolis, on the Blackall Range, beauties of
Mountain, Glen, and Waterfall, that only require to be known to be appreciated.
Here are raised magnificent crops of Sugar Cane, Strawberries, Pineapples, and Citrus Fruits.
Gympie is the premier Goldfield of the South , Maryborough is the centre of an
•immense Timber and Fruit Trade ; whilst Bundaberg is the Sugar centre of South Queensland.

HE total length of this
line with its branches
to Beaudesert on the
Upper Logan and
Cleveland on the Southern Shores
of Moreton Bay is 116 Miles.
The Railway runs parallel with the
coast line to Tweed Heads, via
Beenleigh and Southport. The
lands of the Logan. Albert. Coom-
era. and Nerang watersheds are
principally devoted to dairying.

Tambourine Mountain, at the
head of the Coomera River, is a
noted beauty spot and health
resort. Cleveland. Southport and
Tweed Heads are the favourite
resorts and watering places of
the South Coast.

CONTINENTAL SQUARE TREADS.
The new Continental Square Tread Model de Course Motor Tyre is the
heaviest and strongest pneumatic tyre in the world to-day. It is so
designed that the rubber thickness reaches its maximum strength where
strength is most needed, viz., on the tread. The wear and tear falls
precisely on that part of the tyre best able to stand rough usage. The
“ defensive powers ” of the tyre have been massed in just that position
where the road attack is severest.
CONTINENTAL ANTI-SKID LEATHER TREADS.
The new Anti-Skid Leather Tread Continental Motor Tyres have been
specially designed to meet the requirements of stony road and wet weather
conditions. The leather is cured to the Rubber by a secret steam process —not
a chemical process as is usually employed —and it is impossible for the leather
to cause any trouble by lifting. This new type of Anti-skid Continentals
reaches the highest point ever attempted in non-skid devices. Motorists
who have tried and tested the new tyre are loud in their praises of it.

HRISTMAS being
but a couple of
weeks distant,
with its cluck, tur-
key, heavy pud-
ding and high
temperatures, it becomes
necessary to put in a word for the
Five Companies which drag people
around Australia and drag them back again.
Now, as a matter of fact, though people will sniff
incredulously, the quintet of shipping companies
becomes of imperative necessity to the intending
traveller at the Christmas season, seeing that, if
he wants to go away, he elects, in a number of
cases, for a voyage by sea. dhat solemn fact is
indisputed. People, in truth, generally save up
during the year for a “ trip abroad, since,
to the bulk of them, this rather common
Christian period of festival is, apart from
its incredible pudding and holly and things,
the annual holiday time. And, accepting the
time in its true and antique sense of “holy day ”
—enjoying it liolily—that is, of course, festively,
but sanely and recreatively, it is not surprising
that the Five Companies pouch from them many
a steamer fare. On board a steamer that is push-
ing along between Melbourne and Sydney, or
between Adelaide and Melbourne, there is indeed
everything that suggests festivity with sanity and
recreation. The heat, which often at Christmas
chases people into few clothes and a passion for
temperance drinks on land, hasn t nearly such a
deadly potency at sea. It’s bite is tempered by a
cool sea wind, and the uncomfortable effects
which it produces of plain man steaming and
vaporising are reduced to a minimum, if not
entirely removed. Even the pudding the inevit-
able penance for all of those who in Australia
are English before they are sensible—doesn’t
seem the same sort of pudding at sea. On
land, where it is ravaged by fat people at a
temperature of 104°, and is slowly con-
sumed by a mass of simmering and
olefiant lady or gentleman in a state
of acute strangulation, it isn’t a
convincing argument for the
Christmas which every well
brought up person spends
more or less dutifully. But,
at sea, the dark brown food,
which is always a monu-
ment of mystery and patient
labor, is a very different
matter. Somehow, its ironclad characteristics and
leaden heaviness have assumed a lightness, a fairy-
like airiness. But it is not a change in substance —it
is the same portentous comestible—it is the change
in its surroundings ! If the heat is inclined to be
clamorous—which is rare—there are electric fans
in the saloon ; there is cold liquid all round ; and
every vestige of cool breeze to be had is floating
through the open ports. Under such conditions,
even the sorrowful and penitential concealment of
a tremendously over-estimated bit of nourishment
changes from a popular evil to a something ap-
proaching delight. Now, could such a contrast
between sea and land be fairer or more trium-
phant ?
Now, if there is anything that the prospective
holiday-maker at Christmas resents it is the
possibility of ceremonial while on holiday—of, in
fact, making himself or herself a sort of rigid
religious service in a lot of pretentious clothes.
The ordinary man and woman—and by them are
meant the modest, sensible people which even
every sporting community can produce at a pinch
—wants to be left very much alone in his or her
clothing arrangements while on holiday. Any-
thing does—that is to say, anything that is sub-
stantial and of superior extent to bathing cos-
tumes, fur waistlets, or glass beads, is not censur-
able, because the spirit of holiday must be liberty
without licence in a lot of things that in other cir-
cumstances are strongly and properly regarded.
And it is just on that highly-important point
of dress that life on a steamship has some appreci-
able advantages over that on land. The dif-
ference between the two is not obvious until you
come to think of it—for, generally speaking, holi-
day attire is generally unconventional and careless
wherever it may be. But the point of difference
between what is de rigueur on a steamship and on
land lies in the fact that no one is ever expected
to be a swell on an inter-State steamship, while,
at, say, any popular land resort, one sometimes is.
It is the difference between option and compara-
tive compulsion, and a very solid difference it is !
Thus, for that reason alone, a trip by one of the
steamers of the Five Companies is to be recom-
mended. They don’t ask a person to be attired as
if for a coronation. They leave it to the passen-
ger’s good sense to dress as he or she thinks fit, so
long as he or she doesn’t incline to questionable
eccentricity or foolishness. On the other hand,
at many a fashionable watering place or inland
resort, a person who is not prepared to be impres-
sive, when he or she ought to be indulging in a
sort of sartorial vagabondage, is rather looked
upon as a shocking person, who is very much out
of place. Yet it must not be assumed that any-
one cannot be a toffy perfection on board one of
the steamers afore-mentioned. He or she can, if he
or she likes. But also he or she can just idle
about in the simplest and plainest things, if he or
she likes. That is one of the virtues of a trip by
sea.
But by far the largest consideration to the
thoughtful passenger, who contemplates a run
round to one of the capitals, are the recuperative
and health-giving possibilities of the voyage. One
does not understand what air is until one gets to
sea, away from the curious, lively, and almost
tangible mixture that does duty for atmosphere in a
big city. In a big city, or even in sparsely-inhabited
spots, the air has got to make room for variously-
assorted effluvia, germs, dirt, grit, bluestone, and
other unsuspected substances; whereas, out at
sea, the germs, effluvia, etc., being essentially
land dwellers, drop out of the huge masses of
breath by their superior weight and get drowned
in the coastal seas before they have any chance
of getting further out, to prove a nuisance
to a passing steamer. As a matter of
fact, such things are not met with out at
sea. The air is so pure that it isn’t noticed.
The passenger, who is idling about the deck in
informal raiment, or reading, or spilling tempestu-
ous gallantries to a nice girl in a nook, doesn’t
think of it—or, if he does, imagines he is breathing
vacuum, and an unflavored one at that. Taking
that point into consideration, and also the facts
that there is only restriction to the distance one
may roam, and no restriction to gorgeous eating
and loafing, and even to flirting—if one is young
and ambitious —the intending holiday-maker can-
not but recognise the superiority of a short sea-
trip over a long land one, for instance. Granted
that the land holiday provides a greater selection
of girl and diversions—yet it is
still inferior to the sea one,
by reason of the sea’s
superior health-giving
benefits. If any per-
son doesn’t believe
it, let him or her
try a sea-trip by
proceeding, as a
first step, to the
offices of the Five J
Companies for par- |
ticulars of Christmas |
fares.

CHRISTMAS CHEER.
Anglo-Australian (who makes it a rule at Christmas to eat roost goose and plum pudding, burn Yule logs, and drink hot Wassail with th.
thermometer at 99 in the shade, because "it’s English "): “Ah! Doesn't this take you back to the old world?”
Village Parson: “Well, candor compels me to say that it rather suggests the world to come.”


Brothers.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
PETER and liis friend Jo, who had been
pelting stones down the fiat, grew tired of
that employment and went to call on Bill.
They entered the residence of Bill’s father—re-
ferred to by them with impartial eye to the law of
property as “Bill’s place”—with that depreca-
ting, apologetic way that small boys use on
entering other people’s houses, as though they
were liable to be rushed off the premises at any
moment for trespassing. Skirting the borders of
■a stagnant little pond, they went round and
whistled for Bill at the back door.
“ I suppose he's out,” said Peter after a pro-
longed musical interval that left that reasonable
supposition hardly open to doubt.
He peered in at the kitchen window, applied
his eye to the keyhole of the back door, examined
the washhouse, and after inspecting the wood-
shed and the fowlhouse as equally likely places
for the secretive Bill, came to the conclusion that
his supposition was correct.
“ He's out,” he said indignantly.
“O’ course he's out,’’ said Jo, with biting
scorn. “ Catch him not being out if he can help
it.”
“Bill’s the noted one fer being out,” sneered
Peter, as though Bill’s absence were now an
obvious personal insult.
“ He’s the noted greedy guts of the town,”
said Jo, putting a further point on Bill’s previ-
ously-noted characteristic.
Peter looked fiercely round, as if expecting Bill
to appear and explain his insulting absence, and
his eye lit on a pear tree overhanging the wood-
shed. Instantly his expression softened, and he
nudged Jo.
“Bill wouldn’t mind if we had a oner,” he
said, inspecting the tree closely. “He wouldn’t
mind.”
“ He’d arst us to have one,” said Jo, backing
up his friend's moral courage.
“ Old Bill don’t care if we take his pears,” said
Peter, jovially, jumping at a pear at least seven
feet in the air.
“ Y’ better poke him down with a stick,” said
Jo, having verified with his own person the im-
practicability of Peter's efforts to reach the pears.
They found a prop in the yard and raised it
gingerly aloft. Yet while it was within an inch
of the fruit a small, tubby lad, with a portly
stomach and an aggressive eye, issued with a
shout from behind the fowlhouse. Pie was in the
very act of eating a huge slice of bread and jam,
and his countenance was convulsed with rage.
“Y : probble off plopp,” he roared, his mighty
anger not suffering him to wait until his jaws had
done their office on the bread and jam.
Jo gud Peter, with the damning evidence of the
prop still raised aloft, smiled a feeble welcome.
“What-o, Bill,” said Peter, “ how yer poppin ? ”
“Y’ leave our pears alone,” shouted Bill,
ignoring Peter's base evasion.
“We was on’y seein’ how high we could
reach, Bill,” said Peter, assisting Jo to lower the
prop. Bill laughed scornfully, and took a large
bite. He masticated loudly, turning constantly
from the prop to the pear tree, as if calculating
carefully the criminal intentions of his visitors by
the length of the prop.
The situation called for a change of attitude,
and Peter sought to change it.
“ Why didn’t yer come out when we whistled?”
he demanded.
“ I suppose yer never heard us,” sneered Jo.
“ I suppose yer was out,” continued Peter.
Jo supposed “he wasn’t on’y hidin’ in the
fowlhouse. Oh, no ! ”
Bill merely went on munching. He evidently
had a master retort in reserve, and when they had
quite finished he produced it. ‘ ‘ Who stole the
pears ? ” he said, smugly.
Jo and Peter promptly worked up a
fresh appearance of indignation. Peter,
it appeared, wouldn’t eat a pear if it
were offered to him —neither would
Jo. If there was any form of food more
abhorrent to them than another, it
was pears.
At this stage of their impassioned re-
nunciation of pears another boy was seen
to emerge from the house, eating a piece
of bread and jam that bore a distinct
lamily likeness to Bill's piece.
He was a year or two older than Bill,
and he had a more aggressive eye, but
less jam on his countenance. His
manner of eating was identical with Bill’s.
If anything, he munched a trifle louder.
Peter and Jo addressed him as Sam, re-
spectfully, because of his great age, and
waited for him to begin the conversation.
Sam, being too busy for idle words just then,
merely looked at them abstractedly and
turned his attention to Bill, evidently anxious
to discover the size of his piece and how long it
would last.
Presently Sam bolted the last mouthful of
bread, and, with a sudden assumption of business-
like energy, commenced to climb the woodshed.
Bill watched him intently till he reached the roof,
and then shouted, frantically :
“Ma ! ” he roared, “Sam’s sneakin’ the
pears ! ”
Sam listened anxiously for any signs of Ma’s
approach.
“ Y’ see that fist ! ” he said, showing it to Bill.
“ You touch them pears ! ” said Bill, ferociously.
“ Whose touchin’ the pears ?” demanded Sam.
Bill disdained to answer. lie watched his
brother like a small sleuth-hound. The Law, it
was obvious, had already spoken regarding those
pears.
Sam pondered a moment, and eyed his brother
craftily. “Ma!” he roared, suddenly snatch-
ing a pear and cramming it into his pocket,
“ Bill's sneakin' the pears ! ”
The baselessness of the charge almost caused
Bill to lose his reason. In the midst of deafening
roars for Ma from both parties, he snatched up a
rock and hurled it straight at his brother. It
missed him by a miracle, but almost accomplished
its mission of dashing out his brains, for it precipi-
tated him off the shed. In his
passage he clutched a branch
laden with pears, tore his trousers
on a nail, and brought all to
the ground with a rending
crash.
Having achieved this
eminently satisfactory re-
sult with remarkable ease,
Bill bolted off
into the house,
with the mad-
dened Sam
pounding in
the rear. ,
Brought all to
the ground with
a rending crash.
The friends
nudged each
other, and waited
with indecent anxiety
for the sounds of retri-
bution.
They came speedily-—roars, shouts, poundings,
a crash, and yells of “ Ma ! ” followed by a hearty
crack as though a skull had been smitten by some
flat article, such as a hairbrush, and Sam issued
again from the house applying friction to his
scalp with frantic haste.
He ran straight at the broken branch, filled his
pockets with pears, and pausing only to hurl a
brick at the woodshed, disappeared round the
house.
The friends, sensible that this evidence of
Sam’s displeasure might be reasonably put to
their charge, moved off hurriedly down the yard.
In a little old fusty outhouse, half full of cow-
feed and potatoes, a lanky black-haired youth of
sixteen, with a parsonically solemn manner and a
high-crowned boxer hat, was pottering about over
several oblong boxes with glass lids. The boxes
contained birds’ eggs, butterflies, and various
specimens of the bug and beetle tribe pinned out
neatly in rows.
He returned the greeting of the friends gravely,
and invited them to inspect a disembowelled
cockroach through a small magnifying glass.
Incited by their flattering curiosity to further
exhibit his profound knowledge of beetle life, he
opened a tin tobacco-box, and, from a number of
other live specimens, abstracted a small red bug.
“ He’s a very rare specimen,” said the scientist,
regarding the insect fondly. “ I don’t suppose,”
he went on, applying the magnifying glass to the
small red bug, “ there’s a better specimen than
him for miles around.”
“What’s that bloke in the box?” said Peter,
indicating a fat beetle that had a matchbox all to
itself.
“Him!” said the scientist, contemptuously.
“ He’s only a very common specimen. I put him
in by himself because he eats the other speci-
mens.”
“ I bet he’d bite yer,” said Jo. “ Look at his
nippers.”
“He won’t bite me ,” said the scientist. He
put his thumb down on the fat beetle, just to
show his contempt for it, and withdrew it in-
stantly with the beetle attached.
“ It’s a good job,” he said, after a frantic inter-
val, “ that he wasn't a red-backed spider. As it
happens,” he continued, pushing the fat beetle
into his box with a stick, “he’s only a non-
poisonous specimen.”
While this interesting demonstration was con-
cluding, Bill appeared on the scene. His
Thrust him out of the door.
countenance was irrigated with the marks of
recent tears, and he was munching a fresh piece
of bread and jam. Being ordered by the scientist
not to touch anything, he with all speed touched
a skinned lizard, and got his hand clouted.
There was a furious altercation immediately,
during which the scientist put his head out of the
window and requested Ma to order Bill out of the
Museum.
Pending the arrival of Ma’s mandate, Bill
caused a diversion by pouncing on a parrot skin.
“Me best greenback,” he said, enraged.
“Stolen outer me box—the dirty thief.” The
scientist, thoroughly roused, grappled with the
intruder, and after a desperate struggle, in w'hich
Ht 11 was greatly impeded by his anxiety to save
bis bread and jam, wrested the parrot skin from
his clutches and thrust him out at the door.
Jo and Peter exchanged exultant nudges, while
the scientist, puffing after his exertions, proceeded
with his lecture to an accompaniment of stones
which were rattled on the roof without.
The bombardment presently ceased, and Bill
approached the window, munching. The scientist
was enlarging on a small, dusty-looking insect
which he described as rare.
“ The wonderful part about this'
specimen,” he said, referring to a
pocket-book, “is that it always
huilds its nest in a sand heap.”
Jo murmured applause, and Peter
remarked “ Cripes! ” in an en-
couraging tone. Bill merely went
on munching.
“This insect,” continued the
scientist, “lives mostly on flies and
-—and —insects ” (he referred to his
pocket-book and read aloud). “It
commonly builds its nest in sandy
places, notably on the seashore and
such places where sand is common.”
Peter and Jo had nothing to say to
this astonishing scientific fact, but Bill, the
muncher, produced a bit of pungent criticism.
“ Bags, the skite,” were his words.
The scientist compressed his lips and stared
fixedly at the mocker a moment ; but, on second
thoughts, decided to treat him with silent con-
tempt.
Turning to his store, he produced a tuft of
straw and feathers stuck on one end of a stick,
and offered it for inspection.
“You don't know what that is,” he said,
proudly.
“Spadger’s nest,” suggested Peter, after a close
scrutiny of the article. The scientist laughed
tolerantly and was about to explain the mystery
w'hen Bill did it for him.
“ Hawk’s nest,” he said.
“You clear outer this,” shouted Bags, enraged
beyond endurance at having this choice morsel
of information snatched from his very lips at the
moment of utterance.
Bill merely attacked his piece with renewed
relish, so after more appeals to Ma that were
equally disregarded, the scientist was constrained
to again ignore him. Returning to his lecture, he
took from a corner a small twig to which adhered
a round blob of clay, and holding it well down
out of Bill’s sight, requested a definition of its
character.
“ Spider's nest,” was the prompt from
without.
The scientist tried desperately to reach Bill
from the window, and knocked over a glass jar
Containing a snake pickled in spirits of wine. He
was so distracted by this misfortune that he threw
down a number of bamboo rods and chased Bill
into the house with the obvious intention of doing
aw'ay with him as he ran.
“Fun o’the world, ain’t it ? ” said Peter, as
piercing shrieks from the house announced that
the scientist was putting his design into execution.
“ I suppose Bags and Ma is both onter him,”
said Jo.
Peter supposed it would take the skite outer
Bill. Any further pleasing speculations of this
nature \y_sre interrupted by the appearance of
Sam. He came sauntering round the side of the
house wdth a half-eaten pear in his hand, and
looked in at the window.
“ Where’s Bags ? ” he inquired of Peter.
“ Him and Bill’s had a row',” said Peter, con-
ceiving that a sufficient explanation of Bags’
absence. Sam at once entered the museum, and
with the air of a bailiff began an inventory of its
effects.
“I thought as much,” he said, triumphantly
abstracting an egg from the box. ‘‘ Me best
speckled plover. ” The egg was promptly placed
in a match-box stuffed with cotton w'ool, and de-
posited in Sam’s pocket. The snake went next,
Sam identifying it as the. one he killed a year ago.
A ’possum skin and an eagle’s beak were about to
follow when the scientist made his appearance.
He approached gravely enough until he dis-
covered the intruder, and then his whole appear-
ance partook of apprehension.
“Has he taken anything?” he asked, examin-
ing his valuables with trembling anxiety.
Peter sniggered.
“ I ain’t a dirty thief like you,” said Sam, scorn-
fully, ‘ ‘ sneakin’ a bloke’s plover’s egg. I been
missin’ eggs for a long time,” he informed Peter ;
“lost two pee-w T ee willie-wagtails and a bonzer
white spadger’s. It on’y shows yer,” he added,
“ what a dirty sneak-thief Bags is.”
For answer the scientist took him by the throat
with both hands, and fell with him on the potato
bags. Sam fought hard, and only after a display
of the most desperate energy did Bags wrest from
his grasp the ’possum skin.
It brought with it the snake and a pear, both of
which Bags in the blindness of his rage crammed
into the same pickle jar. There was another
desperate struggle before the intruder was ejected,
he clinging so tenaciously to the doorpost that the
scientist was forced to beat him repeatedly on the
head with the eagle's beak to dislodge him.
Puffing and perspiring, Bags locked the door,
and proceeded to put the place in order, his dis-
ciples exulting inwardly w'hile stones were being
hurled on the roof without.
Presently Bill appeared on the scene again,
w'ith swollen eyes and an innovation in the shape
of a slice of cake. The fusillade ceased, and to him
at once Sam propounded the Masonic question :
“ What ver eatin’ ? ”
“ Cake,” said Bill, as well as a mouthful of it
would permit.
“ Give us a bit, Billo, said Sam, afiectionateh.
Bill laughed scornfully.
“ Give yer a pear for half,” said Sam, promptly
reducing the affair to a business transaction.
Bill narrowly inspected the pear held well out
of his reach, and pondered the question deeply.
At length he broke of! a small piece of cake,
weighed it, felt it, eyed it, bit a corner off it, and
offered it reluctantly. It was peremptorily refused,
and an argument on the respective merits of cake
and pear proceeded w'ith scurrilous abuse, and
only ended, as Peter noted from the window, in
Hill snatching at a pear held out derisively by
Sam, and getting the chewed remains of another
in his left eye.
Bill was not one to allow a mere item like that
to interfere with business.
The transaction was eventually concluded, a
division of cake and pear made, and the brothers
approached the window munching a duet.
Ihe scientist, after watching them narrowly a
moment, proceeded with his lecture as well as an
involuntary flow of saliva, due to the persistent
munching at the window, would permit.
His theme was the mystery of lizard stuffing,
and beyond occasional interruptions from clutch-
ing hands, necessitating the application of the
eagle’s beak, there was a comparatively peaceful
interval. Presently Sam disappeared suddenly,
and Bill, after intently watching certain opera-
tions of his brother, presumably of a highly inter-
esting nature, hurriedly departed also.
There was an impressive silence for a few
moments ; then the heads again appeared at the
window, this time betraying unmistakable symp-
toms of being in some sort of concord.
“ Bags,” said Sam. Bags took no notice.
“ Bags,” repeated his brother with a smile of
invitation, “ look wot Bill and me’s got.”
“ Clear out,” said Bags, peremptorily.
The brothers retired off, and, after an earnest
consultation, again appeared at the window
together.
“ Bags,” said Sam, “ there’s a boshter devil
beetle crawlin’ up the wall. Have a look at
him.”
Bags was troubled. He was torn between the
scientist and the man. After a considerable pause
he condescended half-way.
“Where is it ?” he asked.
“ I’m pointin’ dead at him,” said Sam, indi-
cating with his finger a spot outside on the wall.
Bags put his head out of the window and in-
stantly got the liquid contents of a dirty rubber
ball squirted in his eye by the expert Samuel.
Got the contents of a dirty rubber ball in the eye.
The yells of delight that greeted this outrage
upon his scientific credulity so incensed Bags that
he threw a valuable mineral specimen at Sam and
hit him in the back. Bill, without a moment’s
hesitation, pounced on the prize and tried to bolt
with it, but the scientist, realising his mistake in
time, rushed out and tore it from his grasp. While
he was thus employed, Sam, finding it a fitting
moment, ran up behind and kicked him with
haste. Deafening were the appeals to Ma that
greeted this effort, and more desperate still was
the yell that followed a successful attempt of Bill’s
to flesh his teeth in the scientist’s arm. He
bolted for the house with Bill speeding ahead of
him like a bird before the storm, and Sam im-
mediately in his rear, milking repeated efforts to
perform the difficult feat of kicking him as he
ran.
Without being gifted with any particular powers
of divination, the listeners without had more than
an inkling of what was happening within. The
scientist’s accusation that they had tried to murder
him was described as “a stinkin’ lie” by the
accused, and it was easy to conjecture that their sub-
sequent roars were due to an application of the
rod.
The mineral specimen, produced by Bags as
evidence, was, to his great indignation, confis-
cated by the Court, and the affair being thus con-
cluded to everybody's entire dissatisfaction, the
three brothers appeared on the scene again, if
anything a trifle more bellicose than when they
left it. Bags hurried straight into the museum
and locked the window. Then he hurried out
again with a pot of gum and a strip of paper, and
having locked the door, carefully gummed the
paper across the lock. He drew Sam’s attention
portentously to the device.
“ If you break in there while I’m away,” he
said, “ it’ll be proved by that bit of paper being
torn.”
Sam, had he been of a thoughtful cast of mind,
might have observed that this statement verged on
the platitude, but as it was he merely hooted
loudly, and when Bags had departed, presumably
in quest of peace and beetles, produced a stump
of pencil, and inscribed the paper with this
legend :
BAGS, THE SKITE.
“ Give yer a game of alleys,” he said, turning
briskly to Peter. Before Peter could reply to
this amicable suggestion, Bill put his spoke in :
Bill ran at him from behind and kicked him
in the back.
“ Don’t you,” he said. “ Pie’ll sneak ver
taws.”
Sam marked out a ring, without paying any
attention to Bill, and produced his bag. “ Mow
many up ? ” he demanded of Peter.
Peter signified his willingness to adventure two
alleys.
“ Commonies or milkies ? demanded Sam.
“ Commonies,” said Peter, two of which he and
Jo accordingly placed in the ring. Sam followed
suit, and turned a peremptory eye on Bill.
“ Are yer goin’ ter play ? ” he demanded.


Bill, after pondering the question as usual, and
taking fully two minutes to make up his mind, at
length brought out two little pee-wee alleys and
deposited them in the ring. Sam’s rage at this
contemptible act was enormous. He snatched
the despicable pee-wees up and cast them out of
the ring, leav-
i ing it a
mere
matter
of chance
Bill boiled.
if Bill ever
found them
again.
/ “So yer’d like
to,” he said, his pas-
sion calmed by this
summary act of justice ;
but Bill, not to be out-
done in the mere matter
of flying into a rage, plunged on Sam’s
alley bag, stamped it into the dirt, got
a violent shove in the chest, and fell over
on his back, all in the space of about two
seconds. Sam, without paying any attention to
Bill’s antics, ran anxiously about collecting his
alleys, the impetus of Bill’s plunge having scat-
tered them far and wide. While he was
bending at his task, Bill ran at him from
behind and kicked him in the back, and, without
waiting to hear Sam’s opinion of his act, ran off
round the house like an antelope.
Sam did his best to convince any chance on-
looker from the house that his back was broken ;
but, recollecting in the midst of a howl that his
alleys were still at large, he left off suddenly to
pursue the search. Jo and Peter had secured
their alleys before Bill’s descent on the ring. They
now replaced them to assist Sam.
“ Me little Frenchie’s missin’” he raged, after
a final counting of his wealth.
The little Frenchie absorbed another five
minutes before Sam found it in his pocket, and
the game proceeded amicably till Bill appeared on
the scene.
His first act was to dart into the ring, snatch an
alley, fall over, and get a punch on the head from
Sam. Joe and Peter hurriedly secured their
; lleys and stood aside to give Sam room to per-
form the necessary act of justice.
When it w'as done, and
Bill’s howfls were a promin-
ent feature of the occasion,
Sam rose from his pros- '
trate form to expound
the moral.
“ It’ll learn yer,” he
said, “ not to be an alley
sneak.”
Bill tried madly to kick
his brother with both feet,
too blinded by his passion
to admire the moral lesson
inflicted on his person.
Sam regarded him the
while like one who had
just performed for his bene-
fit a gracious action.
Across the
croquet
lawn.
“ It’ll learn him,” he said, turning to Peter,
“ not to be in such a hurry to snatch a bloke s
alleys.”
“I’ll pay yer out,” roared the quondam alley
snatcher, and having kicked himself with wonderful
rapidity all round the ring on the broad of his back,
he rose from the earth in a compact mass of equal
parts rage and dirt. Before anyone could ascer-
tain his fell purpose he fell on Sam’s alley bag,
picked out his largest-sized French agate, and cast
it into the very centre of the pond.
The French agate had once adorned the handle
of an umbrella ! ! ! It was Sam’s eye-drop taw !
He had been heard to say aloud that money
couldn’t buy it ! It was his most priceless
possession ! It was more valuable to Sam than
his father !
There was a frightful pause.
Bill, obviously staggered at the ease with which
he had done the deed, turned an anxious eye on
Sam, as if to ask what he intended to do about it.
Sam gazed helplessly at the place where his taw
had disappeared, too distracted for the moment
even to howl. He raised both hands in the air,
convulsed his features, and gave three or four
frenzied jumps. It was then that speech returned
to him. “Me only boshter taw !” he roared. At
the word Bill started in a frantic hurry for home
and mother, but he was too late. Too long
already had he loitered at the scene of his crime.
Sam, such w>as his desperate energy, reached the
back gate first and headed him off.
Bill uttered a howl, and fled off down the
garden path, while the visitors, in an ecstasy of
delight, hurriedly climbed a garden seat, and pre-
pared to enjoy the spectacle which they per-
fectly assured was going to end in the grand
manner.
Over the wire netting.
W ith the clutching fingers of the avenger at
his very neck, Bill bolted across the croquet
lawn, over the wire netting, over the flower beds,
through the rose bushes, probably with the
notion of scraping his pursuer off like a burr,
lound the summer house, and then down the
garden path again like an arrow for the back gate.
But it was shut and rightly concluding that he
wou dn t be able to open it in time to save him-
self, Bill turned off and led the chase out of sight
behind the house.
The spectators in the grand stand watched
anxiously for his reappearance. They had not
long to wait. “ Here they come !” shouted
Peter, as they tore into sight again, heading for
the croquet lawn, Bill still a yard in advance, like
a fowl pursued by a bulldog, his countenance
frantic with fear.
Such was the anguish of his mind that he did
three laps round the lawn in record time without
perceiving the futility of his endeavors, and then,
with one last desperate sprint over the hurdles,
cast up all hope, and fell flat on his back, roaring
in anticipation of his doom.
Peter and Jo regarded from afar, but did not
interfere. It was Bill’s business entirely, and
clearly Bill’s opinion of the whole affair was that
he was about to be done away with. He yelled
for Ma what time Sam was operating on him, but
the moment he was released his note changed
with alarming suddenness. With the velocity of
an indiarubber ball he rose from the ground, and
snatching up a length of iron piping, ran straight
at Sam with it raised
aloft.
Sam didn't
wait to discover
what Bill in-
tended doing
with the iron
piping. lie fled
for the fence,
and the visi-
tors, without
knowing ex-
actly why, ran
off in the other
direction.
Their inten-
tions towards
their host were entirely honorable, but there
was no saying what Bill in his baresark rage
might do with the iron piping.
When they looked back Sam had disappeared
and Bill w'as making for the house with tragic
bellow and a tale to tell. If there was any value
in words, Bill was clearly going to get his brother
Samuel into trouble.
Peter and Jo went on their way home, satisfied
that they had spent a thoroughly enjoyable after-
noon.
NORMAN LINDSAY.
A Student of Divinity.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A STUDENT of Divinity, I lived in the vicinity
Of one of our small towns, which shall be
nameless.
Spent my time in meditation, and in quiet con-
templation
Of the things that were most innocent and blame-
less.
From my boyhood I was noted for my learning.
Was devoted
To my books. Was not a scapegrace like my
brother.
And until I left for college, to enlarge my sphere
of knowledge,
I had never kissed a woman but my mother.
And, if I may, I’d like to say,
Though it may seem digressing,
That if a woman looked my way
The feeling was distressing.
I left mother, I remember, in the middle of
December,
For she wished me to take lessons in the city.
She said, “Go and hear the preaching ; you will
profit by its teaching,
And to miss the chance would be an awful pity.”
So I packed my bag and started, leaving mother
broken-hearted,
Although I was filled with joyous aspirations,
Feeling that my great ambition was approaching
its fruition,
For I long.d so much to feel some new sensations.
And, by the way, Fd like to say,
Though I may seem disjointed,
I sought some new ones every day,
And wasn’t disappointed.
Mother said it was essential to select some resi-
dential
Suburb, where the folks would honor and respect
me ;
And a party at the station whom I asked for
information,
Said he knew' the home my mother W'ould select
me.
’Twas a suburb cool and shady, with a pleasant
wddow lady
And her daughter, who was natty, neat and
witty ;
And I felt my hot cheeks flushing when the latter,
sweetly blushing,
Kindly volunteered to show me round the city.
Here let me say, just by the vvay,
She seemed so like a sister
That when I’d known her scarce a day
I—very nearly—kissed her.
I spent my time quite gaily, getting new' sensa-
tions daily,
Taking lessons from the wddow’s charming
daughter.
I indulged in dissipation, feeling quite a sweet
sensation,
Smoking cigarettes and drinking wdne and water.
My lessons w'ere so various that I grew' quite
hilarious,
I learned to play a little game called “ Poker,”
Then I learned to play at “ Snooker,” and
another game called “ Euchre,”
Where she always had a card they called “the
Joker.”
And let me say that, day by day,
My knowledge grew extensive,
Although the games we used to play
Were awfully expensive.
Christmas passed in fun and jollity, in frolic and
irivolity.
My lessons so successfully proceeded
That we grew quite confidential, and she said in
things essential
I had grown so wise I knew' as much as she did.
But, alas ! in my security I heeded not futurity,
Was ignorant of life and its conventions.
So my confidence forsook me when, one day, her
mother took me
By surprise by asking what were my intentions.
And here I’ll say, just by the way,
Though it may not be needed,
Her question put me quite astray.
I knew no more than she did.
I was quite confused and hazy, for my mind was
dull and dazy,
I could scarcely see the widow just before me ;
So I stammered and I stuttered, but before a
word I uttered,
Mrs. Tomkinson supplied the answer for me.
She remarked, in accents freezing, “I am sure
it’s very pleasing
That you’re quite prepared to do what’s right and
proper.”
Then, as if to quite confound me, she flung both
her arms around me,
And she kissed me twice before I’d time to stop
her.
And, if I may, I’d like to say,
Though I may be derided,
She ultimately had her way—
The widow had decided.
Now I sit, with brain all reeling, nearly void of
sense and feeling,
Trying vainly my remorse and grief to smother.
I am weeping as I’m writing, for a letter I'm
inditing
To impart the sad intelligence to mother.
I can see her in my fancy, when she learns I’ve
married Nancy,
And I fortify myself with wine and water.
For, although it may seem curious, I feel that
she’ll be furious
To know that I've a wife and she a daughter.
But, by the way, I’d risk to-day
Her being mad or furious.
A worse thing fills me with dismay,
I’m broke ! And she’s penurious.

THOS. E. SPENCER.
Matterson’s Imagination.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
MATTERSON, the missionary, looked
drearily out through the door of his reed
and bamboo house. It had been raining
steadily for a week, and would probably rain,
with brief intermissions, for the next three months.
The sea was just a tumble of dull grey waves and
ashen foam ; round a curve of the soppy beach he
could see the hunched hovels of the village, with '
their ragged, dripping eaves, and the plumage of
the palms drooped dismally, like bedraggled
feather hats of street Delilahs awaiting custom on
a wet night. He wondered whether the world could
show at that moment a more depressing scene.
The chief item in Matterson’s mental outfit was a
lively imagination. Often its pranks had been
the cause of trouble, but the scurviest trick it
ever played him was when it suggested that he
had a call to the Gospel field. In his boyhood he
had longed by turns to be a bushranger, a cow-
boy, a soldier, a sailor, a big-game hunter and a
beachcomber. All these ambitions had been
sternly repressed by his parents,
whose tendency was to seclude
him as much as possible from
ANCIENT DOMESTIC FUSS.—(Girls forgotten to turn the hour-glass.)
SENATOR : “ And I'd got to be at the Forum by eight."
contact with his kind, and whose ultimate hope
was to see him a respectable city clerk with a jerry-
built villa in the suburbs. In early manhood, a
religious craze took charge of him, and impelled by
a twin desire to convert the heathen and to visit
strange lands (his fancy ran just then rather in the
direction of coral reefs and blue lagoons and palm
trees), he became a missionary.
He had been on the island now for a little over
eight months, and the novelty and enthusiasm of
the early days had faded. Against his will, a
conviction was dawning on him that the heathen
in his blindness was a more estimable person than
the heathen in the light of a religion which only
dazzled and confused his feeble intelligence. He
knew that his flock could only be gathered to hear
his words by dint of bribery ; also that those who
most piously whined the responses and most lustily
shouted the hymns would cheerfully break all the
Ten Commandments ten minutes afterwards.
Dimly he saw that he was converting these people
from a robust, if somewhat rude, Paganism to a
weak-kneed semblance of Christianity, w'hose in-
wardness was w'ell expressed by the caricature of
civilised attire which was the outward and visible
sign of the w'earer’s salvation.
In addition he had discovered that a tropic
island is not necessarily an earthly paradise. The
dazzle of beach and sea, which at first w'as so keen
a delight, now only tired his eyes. He had begun
(though he would not admit it) to weary of his
task and to loathe the ways of his parishioners—•
their squalid abodes and insanitary habits. Now
the commencement of the wet season added
another straw to his burden. All these things, he
tried to convince himself, constituted his cross.
In rare moments of spiritual exaltation, which
usually occurred after over-indulgence in strong
tea, he even hugged to himself the thought that
he was a martyr.
But graver matters also troubled his mind.
Strange ideas, having no connection whatever
with his duties, preyed on him at odd moments —
as when he heard a young girl’s laugh or song, or
caught a glimpse of shapely browm limbs in the
water. He, too, to his horror, found himself all
on wires to laugh, to sing, to dance, to disport
himself in the water, with the owners of those
limbs and merry tongues for company. Gradu-
ally these inspirations began to grow and demand
attention. He fasted and prayed, and for a time
they retired, ever returning, more definite and
more insistent. Voices seemed to call to him
from that world which his carefully shel-
tered youth had never entered—the world of
natural, pleasure-loving men and women. Voices
from lamp-lit, gaily-crowded streets lured him to
join in some mad, merry feast which was ever in
progress. He heard the oddly-thrilling laughter
of women, the whisk of skirts, and the convivial
clink of glasses. He saw the sparkle of wine and
the yet more stimulating sparkle of bright eyes.
He had vague visions of a land of supreme delight,
and also, he feared, of abysmal wickedness. All
these manifestations he attributed to the direct
agency of the Devil. A more experienced person
might have told him that they were but the voice
of his fettered youth clamoring against its
unnatural imprisonment. Some men are con-
structed to be saints, but Matterson was not one
of them.
The end came very suddenly. A colored
brother from Samoa was sent to assist him in his
labors, and the brother owned a wife, an excellent
sample of Samoan comeliness. Matterson was a
personable enough young fellow, and the woman
began to make eyes—large, velvety brown eyes —
at him. She spoke battered English with the
wheedling musical accent peculiar to the women
of her race, and the crystal-clear tinkle of her
laugh was in itself sufficient to seduce a man of
Matterson’s temperament in Matterson’s situation.
With a crash that resounded through the island
he fell from the spiritual pinnacle on which he
had long been tottering. He grovelled in the
abyss, and gloried in his grovelling.
One morning the Samoan appeared on the
mission verandah with a spear. Matterson kept
him at bay from his study with a_ rapid and well-
directed fire of theological works, and finally laid
him low with a ponderous volume of sermons.
Upon this the woman, perceiving that a continu-
ance of her backsliding might lead to serious un-
pleasantness, sought forgiveness, and, after due
chastisement, which left her weeping and de-
corated with weals, was taken back to the marital
bosom. She had set light to what she thought
was a harmless cracker, and a powder magazine
had exploded. Deserted by his idol, Matterson
went mad and remained so for a week. During
these days the members of his flock gained a re-
spect for their pastor which they had never known
before, and showed it by fleeing at his approach.
Occasionally he caught an elder or church mem-
ber or devout sister napping, and chased him or
her into the hills. Finally, the Samoan’s report
to his superiors, Matterson’s letter of resignation,
and Matterson himself all left the island by the
same boat.
As soon as the ex-missionary had recovered his
mental balance, and pieced together the shattered
fragments of the universe, he went to Sydney and
had a really good time, after which he felt greatly
relieved in spirit. The good time consisted
mostly of whisky. The affair subsequently be-
came public. The unregenerate chuckled hugely,
and the regenerate raised scandalised hands to
Heaven, neither party comprehending that it was
the initial suggestion of Matterson’s giddy imagina-
tion w'hich was really to blame in the matter.
Matterson keeps a considerably tighter rein on
his imagination now. His present life is not, per-
haps, a pattern for Christian young men, but he is
doing well in the house and land agency line, and
auctioneers a little, and drinks in moderation, and
believes in mixed bathing.

The Old Baringa Days.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
IS it unchanged, the street we used to know ?
The crooked side-street all unpavemented ?
With lines of terraced houses, long and low ?
We loved one house ; and often overhead
Were wont to meet upon a balcony
That looked beyond the lighthouse to the sea ;
Or lingered in the garden all ablaze
With light and flowers ; a merry group were we,
Who loved, laughed, jested, meeting blame or
praise—
Where are they now, the old Baringa days ?
And sometimes on a moonlight we would steal
Along the garden to the waterside,
And sailing down the widening inlet feel
The breath of ocean ; drifting with the tide ;
Or landing on the beaches, two by two,
Stretched on the sand would dream the midnight
through,
The hot Australian midnight, clear of haze,
And watch the ferry-steamers come and go,
Like fiery serpents through the harbor maze—
Where are they now, the old Baringa days ?
For one of us the ink is choked and dry,
The pen is rust; the volume disappears,
The blessed angels closed it with a sigh,
Written in pain, and blotted out with tears.
Pie was too young for dying,
but, alas!
Death will not stay for Youth,
and all things pass.
One hopes for Life re-
newed, and happier
ways,
But only sees a stone, a
mound of grass;
The flower must fade, the
tender leaf decays—
Where are they now, the
old Baringa days?
And one there w’as, the fairest
of us all,
And gayest —none on earth
was merrier!
Hers was the palm of beauty
at the ball,
Her laughter rang the
clearest— what of her?
The weight of care grows
heavier with the years,
The household flame burns
lower, and she hears
The wolf howl close and
closer as she prays.
And dim, and all distorted,
through her tears
Sometimes the Past arises
to her gaze—
Where are they now, the
old Baringa days?
Ynd one who seemed our
wisest and our best,
One whom we loved, one
whom we honored so,
Is but a shadow, and a name
un blest!
He has gone under—and
we saw him go
Heedless of us! But when
the voices call
And the soul stirs, and baser
pleasures pall,
There comes to him a
Spectre, and she lays
A finger on the writing on
the wall :
“ I am Remembrance ! : so the phantom says ;
‘ ‘ Where are they now', the old Baringa days ? ”
O, when the street is very hushed and still,
And all the house is sunk in quiet sleep,
And the last light has faded from the hill,
Then do the Ghosts awaken ! Ay, they creep
From room to room a-tiptoe on the floor,
With noiseless song and laughter, as of yore.
Steal through the garden to the landing-place,
And, putting forth with sail and soundless oar,
Slide down the harbor to the inner bays—
They are the ghosts of old Baringa days !
Not thus, O married Lovers, O not thus
For you is Recollection perilous !
For now I know your little maiden plays
In spots familiar ; no, it is for us
That Memory, into paths of madness strays—
Where are they now, the old Baringa days ?
ENGLAND.
DORA WILCOX.
A Christmas Eve.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
GRAHAM had taken up a few acres q,t
Brulong years back, when good seasons
were not a novelty. He worked hard
and waxed enthusiastic for a brief period, but
after a couple of bad years he became disgusted,
cursed himself for imagining that a fortune was to
be made on the land, took a burning-off contract
from a squatter up Germanton way, and rode away,
leaving the selection for the “old woman an’
kids ” to look after.'
'From that time he had earned a precarious
living as a bush worker, shearer, teamster, drover,
sleeper-getter—anything, in fact, but what he
started out to be, a cocky.
He paid short occasional visits to the “old
woman,” who was battling along bravely with her
numerous offspring, and led this life until his boys
were able to work. Then he came home, de-
clared that he was broken in health and unfit for
further toil, and sent his sons Bob, Ned and Jerry
forth to follow in his footsteps as toilers of the
bush. He turned his attention to the farm once
more, and got a few acres ploughed and a crop in.
Also he patched up the dilapidated fences, erected
a chock-and-log pigsty, fowlhouse and cowshed,
and announced his intention of breeding pigs and
poultry on a large scale. In these plans he took
no account of the fact that the sun-baked ground
had been for years as innocent of grass as a soup
plate, and that water had to be carted from the
Government tank three miles aw'av.
He seemed contented enough, and if the
struggle was a bitter one, the “ old woman ” com-
plained but little and toiled gamely on, still pre-
senting Graham with additional pledges of affection
at intervals.
If the Grahams progressed but little, the dis-
trict made some signs of advancement. A school
was established, also the inevitable store, pub and
church sprang into being, and Brulong began to
be called a town.
When the long-promised railway line from
Ilotandustytown to Grinanbearit was started,
Graham saw means of adding to his income during
its construction. He was not looking for work
himself, but got three ofhissonson—Bob with the
THE PRODIGAL SON AND THE FATTED CALF.
plough, Ned driving a tip-dray, and Jerry
scooping.
The line passed within a few chains of Graham's
front fence, and a camp of workers was formed
close by, so Graham thought it would pay to take
in a few boarders, and his hard-working wife pro-
ceeded cheerfully to hump the extra burden.
Joe Otway, the blacksmith ; Cameron, the fore-
man carpenter ; Dinan, the navvy ganger ; and
rhe timekeeper were the select few’ that the
Grahams undertook to cater for.
Christmas arrived on the wdngs of a dust storm.
The Railway Department in its wisdom decided
that work should cease on the line from Christmas
Eve till after the New Year, thus giving the
engineer and his staff a chance to get home to
Sydney and have a good time on full pay.
The navvies were to put in the time as best they
could on no pay.
Work ceased at midday on the Christmas Eve,
and Graham s lot returned home and endeavored
to get some of the dust off and clean up a bit ere
the pay cart came along.
Lunch over, Dinan, fairly presentable in a pair
of white moles and clean flannel shirt, swaggered
off towards the Tanksinkers’ Arms, and was soon
followed by Cameron.
Mrs. Graham and daughter Laura were in the
midst of a big wash, and were attending to the
culinary arrangements for the six o'clock dinner at
the same time, having a number of kerosene tins,
boilers and other utensils on a big fire in the open.
All around w ere strewn articles of clothing. The
women did not stop for a moment. How thev
kept up perpetual motion and good temper in a
shade temperature of ioo° odd surpasseth the un-
derstanding of mere man.
Otw'ay, having shaved and cleaned up, pro-
fessed to assist. He helped Laura carry a basket
of clothes to be hung out. Then he wanted to
peg something on the line. Laura snatched the
clothes from him and slapped his face with them,
and ran. He chased her, and there was a giggling
struggle, and she in turn pursued him, screaming.
Then ensued a battle royal. She cast articles of
footwear, rolled up into balls, at him. He re-
taliated. Mrs. Graham joined in the rneelee with
a potstick. In the midst of the fight, Graham
appeared.
“ Come on !” he shouted to Joe. “ Here’s the
pay cart cornin’.”
As a parting shot, Joe seized a red ball and
fired it at the women. It struck Mrs. Graham on
the widest part of her person and bounced away
towards the fire.
Joe ran arter Graham. Laura smoothed her
hair, wiped her face with her apron, and dived
her potstick into the boiler, singing gaily.
The men got their money and adjourned to the
pub to sink the dust that was in their mouths.
Dinan was pretty full ; so was Graham ; in
fact, all soon carried more liquid than was con-
ducive to peace. Graham was ordinarily in-
different about things, religious, but when in liquor
he habitually consigned the Pope to a place hotter
than Brulong. lie and Dinan were with diffi-
culty kept from riotous behavior over abstruse
theological points.
Dinner was served at six. Dinan was noisy
and talkative. Cameron was giving proud imita-
tions of a cat-fight. Otway was sleepy.
Graham took the head of the table and passed
round plates of corned beef and dumpling.
Mrs. Graham darted backwards and forwards to
the kitchen. She never seemed to eat. Laura
attended to the tea. When Graham wanted tea
he went and helped himself, and when the
members of the family wanted more meat, they
got up and cut it for themselves. “Otherwise,”
said Graham, “ I’d never get a bite for meself. ”
The fowls wandered in and out. The parrot
climbed up on Cameron’s head and cursed the
heat. The magpie put his head under
Dinan’s trouser leg, and nipped his bare ankle,
making him jump with a yell that knocked a
dozen flies into the dinner.
“What’s makin’ the doughboys look so pink?”
remarked Otway. No one seemed to care what
color they were, so his question went unanswered.
“I can't think what’s come of them new red
socks o’ yours, Graham,” said Mrs. Graham,
during one of her brief visits. “ They ain’t in th’
wash, an’ I can’t find ’em. You ain’t wearin’ ’em,
are y’.”
“ No,” growded Graham. “ I ain’t got no
use f’r socks this w'eather, but I want ’em
t’-morrer.”
Presently Dinan sprang up, holding some
foreign substance on his fork.
“ P’what sort uv a doughbye d’ ye call this ?”
he demanded fiercely. “ Faith, it’s bad enough to
be atin’ flies an’ dirt, but whin it comes t’r biled
socks, it's the did finish. Pm off. ” Flinging
the object violently at the magpie, he strode
from the room.
Mis. Graham picked it up, “ Bless me if it
ain’t Graham’s red socks, boiled white. How-
ever’d they get in with th’ meat ? ”
Otway guessed how, but held his peace.
While the men were having a smoke, Mrs.
Graham told Jerry to play his accordeon, in the
hope that the music would keep them at home ;
but the sounds of revelry borne to their ears from
the Tanksinkers’ Arms made them restless, and
very soon they were on their way to join in the
fun, and help consume Tracey’s warm beer.
Graham had collected a fair amount of cash
that day. The five boarders’ month’s money and
his three boys’ earnings filled his money bag to an
unusual extent. His wife advised him to leave
the bag with her, but he growled that he was able
to take care of himself, and went with the rest.
The bar was crowded. The atmosphere was
filled with the odor of beer and tobacco smoke.
Eloquent language issued from a score of
mouths. Tracey’s liquor was not suitable to the
season—it was fighting beer, and tended to cause
war rather than to promote peace and goodwill.
Dinan proclaimed his ability to “out” any
man on the premises in three rounds.
Graham not only expressed doubts on this
point, but said severe things about the Pope.
Dinan struck Graham, and Graham went down
with his beer in his hand. He was game, how-
ever, and got up to face the enemy like a man.
A space was cleared in the bar. Dinan had a
bevy of his countrymen at his back. A number
of “ travellers ” seconded
Graham with suspicious enthu-
siasm. Presently while Gra-
ham’ssupporters were furiously
fanning him after a round,
Dinan jumped up with
a wild yell and rushed.
Graham sprang to meet
him, but Dinan dashed
past him, and, catching his
opponent’s chief “ picker up”
a mighty blow, knocked him
through a doorway down
some steps into the back-
yard. Dinan fell after and
on top of the startled “ travel-
ler.” Tw'O of the man’s mates
followed and tried to pull the
big navvy off, but in vain.
He had his enemy by the
throat and was shaking him.
“ Y’ mis’r’ble thafe,” he
roared, “give it up ; give up
th’ mahn’s money. I’ll tear
th’ trote avye, ye beer-stealin’
pickpocket.”
Resistance w’as useless. The
enemy gave in, and handed
over Graham’s bag of money
with curses.
Then the three men went
for Dinan, but he “settled”
them in short order, and
left them stretched like
wounded soldiers on a field
of battle.
Thrusting the bag inside
his flannel, he re-entered the
bar. It w'as empty. Out in
the road a free fight was in
progress. Tracey advised him
to stop where he was, as he
had sent for the police. Dinan
stopped. He wanted no
more fight just then.
Graham's condition w T as the
reverse of good, when his
three stalwart sons rescued
him from the mob and dragged
him home.
He was damaged, and re-
quired a deal of patching-
up, but he had stood up for
his faith, so he said, and w'as
proud of it.
It was news to the boys that the old man had
any faith, but they blamed Tracey for selling beer
likely to raise the sectarian question.
They were helping put their joint and several
Dad to bed when he suddenly went white and
groaned.
‘ ‘ What’s up ? D’yer feel bad ? ” said Jerry.
“Me bag,” he gasped; “me money. I’ve
been robbed.”
He rushed out, his pains forgotten.
At Tracey's things were quieter. Three con-
stables were close at hand, keeping order.
They scratched their heads when told of
Graham’s loss. “ Serve you right,” said the
sergeant, “for mixing with the crowd you did.
There’s some of the worst men on the road here
to-night. Snowy Thompson, th’ cove they tell
me was behind you when you were fighting, ’d
take you down for your shirt.”
They entered the bar. Dinan was embedded
in a deep sleep. The Sergeant shook him.
“ Get up,” he said.
“ T’r Hell wid ye,” growled Dinan. “Lave
me be.”
They raised him forcibly. Graham’s bag fell
from him. With a shout of joy the owner seized
it.
“ Come along with us,” said the Sergeant to
Dinan, but the Irishman objected strongly. Then
there was fun for the onlookers.
It took the three policemen, Graham and his
three sons twenty minutes to overcome and hand-
cuff Dinan, and all were wounded more or less.
And, just when they had finished, a cloud of wit-
nesses surged in and explained matters, and
Dinan’s character being cleared of any suspicion
of robbery he was merely arrested on seven
charges of assault and ten of language.
It was midnight when the timekeeper made his
way homeward. The anniversary of the Re-
deemer’s coming was at hand. Peace was ovei
the earth. At the outer fence he passed Otway
and Laura Graham, and he sighed as he saw that
she was crying. Graham was asleep on the sofa.
Cameron had long since turned in. The younger
Grahams were at rest.
In the kitchen, the tired mother was hard at
work plucking a goose. Her labors never ended.

THE DOMESTIC SNAGS OF EDEN.


With One Stone.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
IT was a raw, rainy night, and Melbourne lav
under a cloud. Sam Sharp and his mate,
Jerry Maunder, late steerage passengers by
the s.s. Kyarra, eastward bound from Fremantle,
had for some hours been drifting about the streets,
stopping every now and again to gaze through
blurred and misty shop windows. At length they
came to a standstill at the corner of a street.
“ Blow me ! ” said Sam Sharp, digging his
hands viciously into the emptiness of his trouser
pockets. ‘ ‘ Blow me if I wouldn’t rather be in
Barrack-street, if it wasn’t for them Perth John
’Ops ! ” He spat savagely and at random into
the roadway.
“ Well, wot wos we to do ?” replied his com-
panion, with the bitterness of a much-maligned
but innocent individual. “‘ No ostentatious
means of subsidence,’ wos wot he said —’im on
the Bench. ‘Out yer go within seven days,’ so
out we went. Perth ain’t no place for a pore
man wot likes lookin’ for work.”
Jerry Maunder stroked his venerable beard.
He was a person with a past —a past full of
hideous errors and misunderstandings with the
police ; but evil communications had left no trace
upon his bland and expressionless countenance.
Given a clean shirt and a broadcloth coat, and he
would have passed for a philanthropist on the
scent of sorrow and suffering.
Sam Sharp was a man of different stamp.
Clean-shaven and confident, he possessed the
craft of a fox. Of his past nothing was known —
which was in itself suspicious, or so the Perth
police hinted, and the two strangely assorted
comrades had it firmly intimated to them that
their continued presence in Westralia was emi-
nently undesirable. Hence their moneyless,
motiveless peregrination of Melbourne streets
upon that raw, misty evening.
“ If there’s one creature wot calls hisself a
human bein’ as I detests more’n I do anythink at
all its a p’leeceman,” said Jerry, waxing eloquent
at the thought of his enforced exile, now that the
utter barrenness of the situation was borne in on
him. He shuddered with unrighteous indigna-
tion. “ I wonder they’re allowed to live —takin’
the bread out o’ the mouths of pore ’ard-workin’
men.”
“ Stow it, Jerry,” replied his companion.
‘ ‘ Wot’s the good o’ squawkin’ ? Precious little
chance of takin’ the bread out o’ your mouth, or
the beer neither —once you got it in. Look ’ere,
we’re both bung; money we must ’ave, and
money I means to get. While you’ve bin gassin’,
I’ve bin thinkin’, and I’ve ’it on a fust-rate dodge.
Can’t possibly go wrong. All you’ve got to do is
to back me up in wotever I sez. I’ll do the
talkin’; you jest stan’ by, and anythink I tells
’em— ‘ Right oh,’ sez you, ‘ that’s O.K.’ ”
Jerry Maunder winked slowly.
“If that’s all, I can do it on me ’ead. Let’s
’ave the idea, Sam.”
“ You’ll catch on to it soon enough,” said the
other. “ Only for’eaven’s sake don’t get grinnin’
and givin’ the ’ole show away.”
‘ ‘ I ain’t got much to grin at, fur as I can see—
as yet,” responded Jerry, with a thoughtful sniff.
The two men threaded their way through
a labyrinth of mean streets, and more than once
Sam Sharp seemed at fault. At length, however,
he gave a satisfied grunt. “ This ought’er be it,”
he said; “yes, this is Wessex-street awright.
See that pub acrost the way, mate ? ”
“Do I not!” said Jerry, dry-lipped and
emphatic.
“ That’s the one—the Green Dragon,” went
on Sam. “Now we’ll jist stop ’ere till a John
shows in the distance. We carn’t do nothin’
without a John.”
The other gave him an incredulous and bewil-
dered stare.
“A p’leeceman!” he gasped. “’Old ’ard,
Sam ! ’old ’ard ! I draws the line at the p’leece.
I ain’t got no use for any of ’em. You ain’t
feelin’ upset like in the ’ead, are you ? ” he added,
anxiously.
“ You make me tired ! ” said Sam, scornfully.
“ Didn’t I tell you all you’ve got to do is to back
me up in wotever I does or sez ? Ah, it’s awright,
there’s a John.”
A burly constable was visible on the far horizon.
“ Come on, Jerry,” said Sam, and he pushed
hurriedly through the swing-doors of the Green
Dragon.
The bar was empty of customers at the moment.
Behind the counter, leaning on squared arms,
lounged a big, red-faced man, with heavy,
clean-shaven jowl. His shirt-sleeves were
rolled back to his elbows, and an enormous dia-
mond sparkled on the little finger of his left
hand. He looked up from the newspaper he was
reading as the two men entered.
“ Evenin’,” he said, and nodded briefly.
Sam beamed upon him with the smile of one
who is full of the milk of human kindness.
“ Evenin’, Mr. Ryan,” he responded, cheerily.
“We’ve come to thank you kindly. Wotever we
should ’ave done without you is more ’n I can tell.
We should ’ave bin robbed for sure. The drink’s
a curse—beggin’ your pardon for sayin’ so, seein’
as you belongs to it, in a manner o’ speakin’.
’Ere, Jerry, why don’t you thank the gentleman
kindly instead o’ standin’ there like a ’lndu idol.
'Ere’s a honest man for you, and that’s wot you
don’t drop acrost every day o’ the week.”
“Thankin’ you kindly, guv’nor, I’m sure,” said
Jerry heartily, and he nodded and smiled at the
astonished publican.
For a moment the latter regarded the two men
in speechless amazement; then he found his
usually ready tongue.
“ Look ’ere,” he said gruffly, his face taking a
deeper shade of purple ; “ don’t stan’ there shak-
ing your silly fat heads at me—d’ye hear ? Do you
want a drink, or don’t you ? ’Cos, if not, clear
out. I won’t ’ave the likes o’ you chaps ’anging
about my ’ouse —it’s your sort that gives it a bad
name. ”
Sam laughed genially.
“Lord ! wot a ’ot un ’e is, ain’t ’e, Jerry?
Must ’ave ’is little joke. Why, boss, you know
awright ; we’ve called for the ten quid you said
you’d take charge of for us larst night when we
come in a bit sprung, and thankin’ you kindly
once more for us both, I’m sure.”
“ Thankin’ you kindly, I'm sure,” echoed the
parrot-like Mr. Maunder.
“Ten quid ! Last night ! What you left with
me ! ” gasped Mr. Ryan, bringing his huge fist
down on the counter with such force that the Very
Special Scotch started violently in its place next to
the Real Old Tom. His face was convulsed with
fury.
“ Ho, that’s your little game, is it ? ” he roared.
“You just wait a minute—l’ll show you ! ” and,
with a marvellous agility for one so massively
proportioned, he vaulted the bar.
The next instant the swing-doors of the Green
Dragon oscillated violently, and an elderly, gray-
whiskered gentleman shot across the pavement
with remarkable celerity to sit down abruptly at
the advancing feet of Constable 21 A. With no
interval worth mentioning, he was followed by
Sam Sharp, who brought up all standing against a
friendly lamp-post.
“Now, then, what’s all this about?” de-
manded the policeman, sternly, as he surveyed
the two unfortunates by the feeble, flickering
light of the lamp. “ You’d better be getting
LIFE IN THE FAR WEST.
The player is Mrs. Publichouse’s daughter, just from school. The gentleman “ singing ” is
a fencer “ doin' in” his cheque. He can sing as long as his cheque lasts.
home quietly, before I thinks twice about it and
changes my mind.”
“ Ho, yes ; that’s a good un, that is,” stuttered
Sam, hoarse with passion. “An’ wot about the
ten quid —the ten golden suv’rins me and my
mate ’ere ’as been robbed of? Go ’ome quietly !
Yes—likely, ain’t it?”
“Likely, ain’t it?” said the echo, who was
tenderly feeling the outlying portions of his
anatomy.
Number 21A cast a dark glance at the perspiring
windows of the Green Dragon as a noisy group of
semi-intoxicated sailors went pushing their way in
through the swing-doors ; then he turned, and re-
garded the two men with an air of almost benign
interest.
Mr. Ryan had long been in the black books of
the police, and there wasn’t a single member of the
force who would not gladly bowl him out if he got
half a chance. Number 21A was no exception ;
besides, it might mean promotion for him. So he
spoke with almost fatherly solicitude.
“That fellow Ryan been up to his tricks
again ? ” he asked.
The men were evidently not drunk ; his ex-
perience told him that.
“ I dunno wot you call a trick,” grumbled
Sam ; “ all I know is me an’ my mate landed off
of the Kyarra yesterday arternoon, an’, like a
couple o’ mugs, we got drinkin’, an’ that man,
seein’ ’ow it wos with us, offered to take charge
of some of our money in case we fell into bad
company an’ got robbed.” He laughed un-
melodiously. “ Faith, I think we fell into bad
company sure enough ! Ten golden quid of ours
’e’s got, an’ now ’e denies ever ’avin’ set eyes on
us even. ”
“ Didn’t you ask him for a receipt?” said the
constable.
“ That’s jest the bother,” replied Sam. “We
took ’is word as ’is bond. No, we never arst ’im
fur no receipt.”
“Well,” said the constable, “the best thing
you can do is to summons him for the amount.”
Sam shook his head.
“ Ain’t got no money for summonses.”
Number 21A thought for a moment. The op-
portunity of settling some long outstanding scores
with Tim Ryan was too good to be missed.
“ Come along with me,” he said ; “ I’m going
off beat. I’ll fix the summons up for you. ”
Late that night, as Sam and Jerry sat together
in the diminutive room procured for their accom-
modation at an exceedingly low figure, bv favor
of their new-found friend and ally, the former
said :
“ This is about the rummiest go ever I struck.
To fancy me and you bein’ pally with a John !
Wonders will never cease.”
“ I’ll never say another word agin a p’leeceman
as long as I live,” said his companion. “If I
see’d one fall down, blow me if I wouldn’t pick
’im up.”
The following morning the summons was duly
served on Mr. Ryan, of the Green Dragon Hotel,
Wessex-street.
At first he was disposed to treat the matter as a
doubtful joke, carried a thought too far ; but on
perusing the mandate a second time, his corru-
gated brow became more and more overcast, and
his manner correspondingly gloomy.
“ I wonder they didn’t summons me for an
assault as well,” he muttered ; then, raising his
voice, he called to his barman :
“ Here, Jim, come and mind the show for a
bit; I’m goin’ across the road to see Murphy.”
He donned his hat and coat, and walked a
short distance down the street, until he came to a
public-house pleasantly misnamed the Hermitage.
There he was confronted by a man who might
almost have been taken for his double, but for
an additional inch or two in height, and a
bristling, swarthy moustache.
“ Mornin’, Patsy,” said Mr. Ryan, and with a
few explanatory words he put the offending paper
into his friend’s hand.
The latter perused it stolidly from beginning to
end.
“Well,” he remarked, when he had finished
reading ; ‘ ‘ it’s a pretty cool try-on ; hang me if
it isn’t. I can understand ’em trying to bluff you
in the first instance, but this summons he broke
off short with a shrug of his burly shoulders.
“ Couple o’ d—d dead-beats,” growled the
other. “It was that blamed John put’em up to
this, I’ll swear. They were talkin’ together out-
side o’ my place for nigh on quarter of an hour.
Look here, Patsy, the police have got it in for me
over two or three things, and I’ll go down over
this, as sure as death. I shouldn’t so much mind
if there was any truth in it, but to be bounced by
a pair o’ plucked pigeons like them two chaps is
a bit over the odds.”
“ Well, it’s a bit rough on you, I own,” said
his brother-publican, sympathetically. “ It’s a
game that oughter be stopped. If they win this,
shouldn’t wonder if they wasn’t to drop on me
next.” He whistled thoughtfully.
“ I’ve bin thinkin’ matters over cornin’ along,”
pursued Mr. Ryan, “and I’ve decided that I’d
sooner lose the tenner than chance ’avin’ my
license endorsed. They can’t show any receipt
for the money, but they’ll be two against one, and
the Johns will make it pretty warm for me. I’m
bound to go down, so far as I can see.”
‘ ‘ Why not get Gill to take up the case for you ?
Gill’s as good as gold. After he’s bin at ’em for
about five minutes, they’ll have contradicted ’em-
selves a dozen times.”
Jim Ryan shook his head despondently.
“No,” he said ; “Gill would cost me more
than a tenner before he’d finished with me.
Besides, I’ve hit on a better dodge than that. See
here ” —he produced a bulky pocket-book from
his breast, and subtracted thence a bundle of
greasy bank-notes —“two and four’s six, and
four’s ten,” he counted. “ Catch hold, Patsy.
The case’ll come on to-morrow mornin’. When
the old man on the Bench has done with me you
get up in court and swear that it was you the two
chaps left the money with, and that you are all
ready to pay it down on the nail —see ? It’ll
teach the Johns to be a bit more careful another
time. We shall both come out top, and I’ll find
a way later of gettin’ square with the dead-beats.
’Pon my soul, Patsy, I believe the thing will turn
out a good advertisement for the pair of us. By
rights you should stand in half —eh ? ”
Patsy grinned and pocketed the notes.
“ Right, oh,” he said, “ I’ll do it; but as for
standin’ in, this is your shout—it’s your character
that’s got to be whitewashed, not mine.”
“ A fat lot o’ use whitewash ud be to you,”
grunted the other. “Your character’s a bit far
gone for whitewash—it wants enamelling.”
The case of Samuel Sharp and Jeremiah
Maunder against Timothy Ryan came third on
the list next morning.
The presiding magistrate frowned ominously at
the mention of the publican’s name.
Sam, as chief complainant, gave a very con-
vincing and lucid account of the irregular banking
transaction in the bar of the Green Dragon, what
time he and his mate and the landlord were the
sole occupants thereof, winding up this pleasant
little fiction with a touching reference to his own
and his companion's position as strangers in a
strange land.
“ I hope this will be a warning to you both,”
said the magistrate, severely. “You deserve to
lose your money.”
“ Please God, I’ll never touch the drink again
—never no more,” said Sam, with pious unction.
Jerry’s evidence went to corroborate that of his
comrade in misfortune. Indeed, it did more ;it
awakened an obvious compassion in the breast of
the Bench—the witness looked so venerable and
woebegone.
Police Constable Number 21A deposed that
there had been many complaints concerning the
defendant, but so far, owing to his supernatural
artfulness —this was merely hinted at—he had
escaped conviction. Yes, the two complainants
were quite sober when they appealed to him.
The elder of them had a severe bruise in the small
of his back. Here his Worship interjected that
there was no mention of assault on the charge-
sheet. • Would 21A kindly keep to the matter in
hand.
Mr. Timothy Ryan denied the charge in toto.
It was a monstrous fabrication, bolstered by the
Johns —he begged pardon, the police. He had
never set eyes on the complainants until they came
into the Green Dragon, when he was alone in
the bar the night before last, and sprung some
story on him about ten pounds, which they de-
clared they had left in his keeping the previous
evening. There was not a word of truth in the
whole assertion.
“ Well,” said the magistrate, conclusively; “ I
am inclined to believe the story told by the two
complainants. Ryan, you must pay. I have
heard a good many strange things concerning you
lately. If you are not very careful you will be
getting into serious trouble. ” He paused.
“ Might I say a word, your Worship ? ” came
an insinuating voice from the body of the crowded
Court, and Mr. Murphy stood erect, the cynosure
of all eyes.
“ What is it ? What do you want ? ” asked the
magistrate, a thought irritably.
“ Merely this, sir—your Worship. Those two
gentleman are making a slight mistake. It was
me they left the ten pounds with on the night of
the 10th, and very much the worse for liquor they
both was at the time, Ido assure you. Me name
is Murphy, sir, and I keep the Hermitage, a few
doors off of the Green Dragon, Tim’s—that is, the
defendant’s —’otel in Wessex-street. Here are
the notes, your Worship. I’ll be glad to get rid
of them.”
The magistrate looked first at the speaker, then
at Tim Ryan. Finally his gaze rested inquiringly
upon Mr. Sharp, who was nodding and smiling at
the embarrassed Mr. Murphy.
“That’s awright, sir,” said Sam, cheerily
addressing the Bench. ‘‘ I knows all about that.
Mr. Murphy there is a gentleman—one in ten
thousand. I’d trust ’im with me life. He’s not
like that other one wot I wouldn’t so much as
touch with a red-’ot poker.” (He cast a glance
of withering scorn upon the purple Mr. Ryan.)
“ I knew that ten pounds would be awright, your
Worship; I wosn’t worryin’ me ’ead about it at all.
Mr. Murphy’s a nobleman. Wot I am anxious
about is the ten pound wot I left with that man
Ryan—l suppose ’e calls hisself a man. Twenty-
five pound wos wot me an’ my mate ’ad when we
landed; ten Mr. Murphy kindly kep’ for us, ten
that ’ere shark collared, an’ five we’ve spent. ”
He fixed the almost raving Mr. Ryan with a
baleful eye.
“ There, that will do,” said the magistrate,
testily. “ Ryan, you will have to pay, and, let
me repeat, I don’t want to see you in this court
again. You two men, this should be a lesson to
you to be more prudent in the future. Next
case ! ”
Thus did Sam Sharp and Jerry Maunder acquire
a tenner apiece, and thus did Mr. Timothy Ryan
lose his money and his temper, to say nothing of
his license, which was refused at the very next
sitting of the Licensing Bench.

Regret.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
TT cometh up out of the past, as a corpse cometh
out of the sea ;
1 Yea, it lies on the shore at last, as grim as a
corpse can be !
Lo ! I wander along the beach, and I suddenly
find Regret,
Lying cold and barren of speech, all pale and
clammy and wet !
Lying stark on the silent sands, all lone, un
covered and bare ;
And I hide my face in my hands, and I leave
the dead thing there !
Aye, I try to bury its name far down in an
awful pit ;
But it burns like a deathless flame, and always
I think of It.
When the tide cometh in once more, I lie
awake and I think ;
Is it still spread stark on the shore, by the wide
grey ocean’s brink?
And I rise in the dead of night, and I go forth
in haste to see,
But the sands lie barren and white, and my soul
is filled with glee !
But there cometh a day again when by hazard I
w'alk that way ;
And I see with a reeling brain the corpse all
clammy and grey.
It is then that I turn and flee, for my eyes are
dim and wet;
Aye, I curse the pitiless sea, that casts up my
dead Regret.
And alas for the tortured soul, for never may it
escape
From the cynical tides that roll that clammy and
ghastly Shape !
I may dig a grave in the sands, and try to bury
my pain ;
But the tide with pitiless hands will quarry it
forth again.
Aye, the sea will harry it forth, and fling it down
on the beach ;
And the zenith will scowl in wrath, and the light-
ning-flash will preach.
Aye, the flame of the starless storm will show me
kneeling yet
By the side of that dreadful form —unburiable
Regret.

Plague IX.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
AND it came to pass after many days that the
wickedness of man was great on the earth,
and that every imagination of the thoughts
of his heart was only evil all the day, and most of
the night; yea, even until the next day. And
they said, one to another, “ Cumanavadrink.”
And they came to a certain pub-
lican and said : “ Lo, if now
we have found favor in thy
sight, give us, we pray thee,
of that brown liquor that
maketh glad the heart
of man, that we may
drink before we die ;
yea, even the long
sleever that cheers
and the Jimmy
Woodser that in-
ebriates.” And he
said: “Show me
this day the spon-
dulix —swear to me
this day.” And they
swore to him, some-
thing awful , and
planked down divers
pieces of silver, say-
ing : “ Have one
yourself.” And they
did drink, and be-
came filled with the
spirit, and prophesied,
saying: “We’ll have
a shillin’in.” And it
was so.
And they cast the
dice, saying : “ Sixes,
if Heaven loves me ! ”
And they contended
one against another;
each trying to defeat his
brother. And one cast
eighteen; and another
said unto him : “ Save a
bob with you.” But he
laughed him to scorn, say-
ing : “ I’ll see thee to-
morrow.” And there was
none that could throw nine-
teen ; no, not one. For the
hand of the (land)lord was against
them. And he that cast eighteen
scooped the pool.
And again they looked upon the wine when it
was red, and the beer when it was brown, and
the w'hisky when it was amber-colored. And
being filled with the spirit (yea, even very full)
they prophesied, saying: “Be Cripes ! We
won’t go home till morning.” And they said :
“ Come, let us drink and be merry, for to-morrow
we have to graft like blazes.”
And one said : “ There is balm in Gilead.
Behold the prayer-book of the (land)lord ! Yea,
even the prayer-book of Kings and Queens, of
Right Bowers and Left Bowers, and of Aces and
trumps.” And they prayed, saying : “ Get ’em ! ”
And another prayed, saying: “Fifteen two, fif-
teen four, and one for his Nob.” And yet another
prayed aloud, with a great and exceeding bitter
prayer, saying : “ Lo ! These seven hands have I
played, and thou gavest me no trumps. But to
this thy partner in iniquity thou gavest the
Right Bower and the Left Bower, the Ace,
and the King—yea, and the Queen also. But
to me thou givest the seven and the eight,
yea, even the Curse of Scotland. And if Clubs
be trumps, then will my hand be full of Hearts
and Diamonds ; but if Hearts be trumps, then
will I have many Spades and Clubs. All these
evils have come upon me. Now, therefore, the
Curse of Scotland will I lead ; and if mischief
befall him by the way, then will ye bring my red
hair in sorrow to the Bar.” And he that was
least among them lifted his voice and said :
‘ ‘ What shall I do because my partner is too
squiffy ? To play he is not able ; to lose I am
ashamed. lam resolved what to do : I go
alone, be myself, widout you, William Smith.
Then came one, all wild with haste and beer,
saying: “Woe unto you, ye sinners; for, lo !
the grasspillars and the cattlehoppers are upon
us.” And they mocked him, saying, “ I see thou
hast thine old brown hat on."’ And he said:
“ Behold the land is devoured by locusts. NOW,
will ye be good ?” And they said : “ Let em
loke!” But another said: “Come, let us see
these things that have come to pass." And, lift-
ing up their eyes, they beheld the grasspillars ;
yea, even very much cattlehoppers. Before them
there were no such cattlehoppers as they ; neither
shall there be any such after them. For they
covered the face of the whole land, and devoured
every green window-blind. And there remained
not any green thing in the land except the handle
of the beer-pump, which is blue. And, besides
this, nothing that was green remained.
And when they saw these things they said :
“Wot oh, she grasshops.” And their remarks
were not fit for publication, but merely as a guar-
antee of bad faith. And fear fell upon them.
And they cried aloud with a great and exceeding
bitter cry, saying : “ Behold the Fan tods ! Yea,
even the JIMJAMS ! ” And they feared ex-
ceedingly ; so that they looked not again upon
the wine when it was red, but stuck religiously to
whisky every time. As it is said, even unto this
day : “ Mine’s a whisky ; what’s yours ? ”
LAZECUS.
A Modern Melodrama.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
IT was just on midnight. Clad in costly furs
and evil intentions, the Beautiful Fiend glided
out from the darkness of Argyle Cut and
hastened citywards. Planted in her warm muff
were a six-chambered Colt’s revolver, a bottle of
vitriol, and the remains of a box of chocolates.
Murder was in her heart and her eye shone like
the front of a tram-car after dark.
“ His time has come,” she hissed. “ To-night
I shall scatter his brains on the footpath ! ”
In the shadow of a telegraph pole, outside the
Union Club, she crouched, and fiercely crunched
the last of her caramels. Then she tossed the
empty box from her, and drew the pistol. A roar
of laughter sounded from the smoking-room of
the brightly illuminated Club. The Beautiful Fiend
heard it, and peered furtively from her lurking
place. The flashing arc globe outside the Club
sbone, for a swift second, on her painted face.
STILL A CHARM.
THE MAN: “ What? Does yer think 'cause
yer been goin' out with that other bloke I
'as no love for yer? Why, yer charms me
more an' more, for now yer a woman with
a past."
Her black eyes were blazing now with demoniacal
fury; her scarlet lips curved into a bow of cruelty.
As she drew back into the evil shadow her
diamond bracelet clanked ominously against the
butt of the revolver.
“Ha !” she muttered ; “he comes !”
Adolphus Fitzßlazes, the Gay Deceiver, swung
jauntily down the steps. He was a fair, well-
nourished young man, wearing an eyeglass in his
eye, a wide expanse of shining shirt front on his
chest, and a cigar in his face. He walked straight
towards the fatal telegraph pole, where the woman
waited with her weapon. He had deceived her
and thrown her from him with such force that she
had rebounded. He was humming a fragment from
“ The Belle of New York,” and was glowing with
wine and good food.
Suddenly the Beautiful Fiend sprang from her
ambush.
AT A HASH-HOUSE.
MR. BACKBLOCK (just come to town): “ Please, Miss, this ere steaks too tough.
WAITRESS : “ It’s good enough for the likes o' you ! Why, you never even knew that meat
was good to eat before you came here."
“ Hound,” she gritted, between her gold-filled
tooth, “ your hour has come ! ”
“ Great Scott ! ” shrieked Adolphus.
The painted She Devil aimed straight for his
eye-glass. There was a flash—a roar ; then the
bullet struck the horrified Fitzßlazes an inch below
his watch chain, and he fell, with a stream of
champagne spurting from the deadly wound.
With a blood-curdling laugh of triumph the
murderess sped swiftly away from the scene of
her crime. As she raced off a dark figure shot
around a distant corner, and along the pavement
came a rush of rubberheels. The owner was a fleet-
footed policeman, attracted by the sound of firing.
He was a junior constable, and the sole support of
his aunt.
He paused, aghast, at the sight of the still
figure, in evening dress, lying perforated on
the cold footpath. A strong whiff of Cashmere
Bouquet assaulted his nostrils.
“Aha!” he ejaculated, “this is a woman’s
work. I must run her to earth before the scent
grows cold ! ” Clapping his helmet tightly down,
he emitted a wolf-like bay, and with nose eagerly
sniffing the fatal patchouli, he followed the scent
and galloped in hot pursuit of the murderess.
The Beautiful Fiend heard him panting behind.
“ I will not be taken alive,” she hissed. She
turned on her high heels like an infuriated snake
and threw the bottle of vitriol, and the policeman
fell, blaspheming, over an empty garbage tin.
Through the fog the lamps of a cab, at the
corner, shone eerily. The Beautiful Fiend raced
tow'ards it and sprang in, and the cabbie
whipped up his steed. She laughed again, a
horrid cachinnation of triumph, as the horse went
flying through the night along the South Head
Road. But Nemesis was at hand.
Through the opening in the roof of the vehicle
the cabman peered down at the woman with a
hell of hate shining in his eyes. He recognised
h er i— s he was the black-souled siren who had
blighted hisMife, and swindled him of his fortune
years and years ago. She it was who had
degraded him to driving a common cab for a
crust. Memories of long winter nights on the
rank, with never a fare to cheer him, rendered
him merciless, and a lust for revenge filled his
diaphragm. He headed the horse towards the
Lighthouse, whipped the beast to a gallop, tight-
ened the spring on the cab doors, and, as they
went swaying recklessly onward, he denounced
the She Devil through the trap-door, and told her
to prepare for a leap into Eternity.
The Beautiful Fiend, in terror, begged for
mercy.
“No!” shouted the maddened Jehu ; “you
ruined me ; I’m going to drive right over the Gap,
and down we’ll go together ! ’
The speed of the cab quickened as the lash
stung the flanks of the galloping horse. The
Beautiful Fiend heard above the rush of wheels
and clattering hoofs the roar of the sea, and des-
perately felt for the revolver to shoot the madman
through the roof of his own sixty-guinea cab. But
the weapon was gone, and, in spite of all efforts,
her hat-pin failed to reach him. As they thun-
dered past the Lighthouse, her old-time lover
chuckled, then burst into ribald song. The roar
of the breakers sounded nearer as they raced to-
wards the Gap. Then the horse crashed through
the frail fence on the cliffs, the side was torn out
of the cab, the man on the box gave three cheers,
and down they rushed towards the curling
breakers hundreds of feet below.
The Beautiful Fiend shrieked as the icy waters
closed over her. She struggled manfully to rise
and swim ashore ; but a fluke of one of the
anchors of the wrecked Dunbar caught in her hair,
and she was lost.
Ten days later the cabman was picked up, far
out at sea, floating on the ruins of his cab.
He had eaten the last bit of candle out of the
lamp, and rescue came just in the nick of time.
He left the ship when it reached South
America, and went bravely into the mountains to
dig for gold. He is now a bolster pf fashionable
London Society, and the happiest of mankind.
Thus does virtue triumph and vice meet with its
deserts.
DRIFTER.
The Nice Little Han.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A NEAT little man with eyes of blue,
And peace in their calm depths hiding ;
A Nice Little Man, just five-feet-two,
With a mien of soft confiding.
A long blue “ Colt ” was his constant dress ;
Red shirt, and pants and gaiters ;
And he sometimes carried a short “ Express ”
For shooting at alligators.
He spake maids soft, and he spake men fair,
And sweet was his voice, as honey,
They whispered, over their grog, out there
That he hadn’t a care for money.
A peer’s lost son, or a pleb’s poor heir,
Nobody knew his breeding ;
lie spoke maids soft and he spoke men fair,
And passed on his way unheeding.
No one chivvied the nice little man,
He usually fought to win ; he
Had killed a chief, so the story ran,
And eaten him in New Guinea.
That chief, they said, had expressed desire
For nice little man on toast there,
So the Nice Little Man just opened fire,
And chief was the evening roast there.
They treasure tales in the China Sea
Of a pirate mild and sunny,
Who smuggled opium in as tea,
And rum, disguised as honey.
They whisper yet on the West Coast bold,
From Panama down to Chili,
Of Gatling guns to rebels sold —
As “ pianos from Piccadilly.”
The Nice Little Man went here and there ;
He was always trip-trip-tripping
He was fond, he said, of change of air ;
And specially fond of shipping.
But they shook their heads in Uruguay,
And laughed on the Orinoco ;
If the Nice Little Man just chanced that way
To buy a shipload of cocoa.
The Nice Little Man once from afar,
With a cargo of ammonia,
Appeared down South, and they had a war
That winter in Patagonia.
Such nice little men go up and down —
All over the world you’ll find them,
They’re mostly placid and mild and brown,
And they leave no tracks behind them.
They speak most tongues and they know most
ports,
And routes and codes of cables ;
They write no long red-tape reports ;
Their luggage wears no labels.
They do not boast and they seldom swear ;
They come and go like the swallow's ;
But they’ll tell you over the grog out there —
That trouble tcsually follows !

Chaos!
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I HAD a w'eird, strange dream last night—
Or rather a dream had me,
For every Wrong W'as good and right,
And Right was Iniquitee !
Yea, every Whisper low was a shout,
And every smile was a frown—
My dream was a dream of the Inside-Out,
Chaotic, and Upside-Down !
And every sinner, too, was a saint,
And every saint he quaffed
Good ale without the least restraint,
And winked at the gods—and laughed !
At eight the roysterer w'ent to bed—
A teetotal drunk was he ;
And the temperance man slew ten men dead
(He w'as raving mad on tea).
The kings and queens were subjects there,
And the subjects kings and queens ;
The horse ate chops (’twas a vision fair),
And the lion ate naught but beans.
And I was a saint with a halo high,
And you had the Devil’s tail !
We sailed on a sea that was dead and dry
In the teeth of a dead calm gale.
It was a strange wild dream I had^—
A dream of the World Reversed,
Where Bad w'as Good, and Good was Bad,
And the Best of All was the Worst !
Where every certainty seemed a doubt,
And every seer was a clowm—
My Dream was a dream of the Inside-Out,
The Tangled, and Upside-Down !

THE DISPOSAL OF A DOG.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
NICHOLAS DON called across the street.
He was leading, or rather dragging,
a tall dog that objected strongly.
When Nicholas put on an effort the dog sat down
hard and choked, his four paws ploughing through
the dust like a new' kind of one-man onion har-
vester. It was a hot Saturday afternoon, and
this was hard work. The dog was heavy, he had
plenty of bone, and when he threw his influence
against the leader progress was almost impossible.
“ What-o, Benno ! Er w'ord with yeh,” cried
the Don.
“ Can’t be did,” replied Mr. Dickson; “im-
portant engagement. Got er date with er bunch
iv frill.”
“ Ga-art ! What of it? Len’s er hand, ’n’
I’ll buy ther beer.”
Benno did not care for beer, but he hadn’t the
courage to confess it. The pretence of an un-
dying devotion to “ pints ” and “ pots ” was one
of the most cherished affectations of his class.
“ Now yer talkin’,” he said. “ That’s me little
weakness. Yeh could lure me from er harem
with ther smell iv er cork on er day like this.”
Mr. Dickson crossed the road with a proper
show of avidity. Nicholas Don removed his hat,
scooped honest perspiration from his brow, and
hurled the moisture at the dog. “ Whew, ain’t
she er corker ? ” he said. “ ’N’ I’ve pulley-hauled
this ’ere cart-horse spaniel all ther way from
Spats’ privit residence. I was jist tryin t’ make
up me mind whether I’d go further ’r curl up here
’n’ die when yer gills drifts in. Fer ther love iv
mother, Benno, stir him up aft ’n’ save me life.”
Our Mr. Dickson examined the animal closely,
accurately, with the wise air of a dog-fancier. Lie
felt the tyke’s ears, measured his tail, and inspected
his teeth. “Er carriage dog,” he said, speaking
as a man whose judgment was final, “but he'ain’t
pure bred. Yiv bin done in, Nicky, if yeh give
more ’n er quid fer ’im.”
“ Er quid 1” cried the Don, “ Me give twenty
deener fer er calamity like that in me sober
moments? Garn, who’s dippy? This is er
public nuisance I’m commissioned t’ do away
with. Fer months past he’s bin makin’ hisself
perticularly objectionable to Odgson’s people,
runnin’ steeplechases with the hens, moppin’ up
ther breakfas’ milk, sweatin’ ther famb’ly cat, ’n’
breakin’ in ’n’ dossin’ on ther best beds. So Spats
intruded me nibbs t’ destroy ther brute, ’n’ slid me
er dollar. That was this mornin’. Now I’m on
me way, but I can’t buy poison deadly enough fer
er tough like this without er witness. If ye’ll
come along we’ll dope Tiny, ’n’ then chop up the
dollar. ’
“ I’m with yeh,” said Mr. Dickson, setting his
straw on the back of his head. “You pull’n’
I’ll push.”
So while Nicholas Don towed with the rope
over his shoulder, Mr. Benjamin Dickson
prompted the dog behind, and progress again
set in. At the shop of Squills and Beegin,
chemists, Nicholas explained his need. He
wanted something fatal to dogs. “Somethin’
sudden,” he said. “ You mustn’t give him time
t’ think, or he’ll pull out. He’s ez strong ez er
camel ’n’ has the digestion ivan alligator.”
Even while Don w'as giving his order the dog
began to revolve. He turned round three times,
and then sat up, stiff’ and hard, with all his hair
bristling, and snapped viciously at the atmosphere.
Benno retreated to a corner. Nicholas fell back.
The chemist seemed concerned. There was a
wild look in Carlo’s eye, and froth oozed from
the corners of his mouth. He snapped right and
left, and then started to revolve again. He
increased his pace, spinning after the manner of
a playful collie humorously chasing his own tail.
But there was no frivolity about this dog—he
whirled in a sort of frenzy. His pace increased
till the characteristics of a dog were lost in a sort
of revolving pattern.
“ Stop him ! Hold him ! ” yelled the chemist.
“That be jiggered fer er yarn,” retorted
Nicholas Don, and he climbed on a chair.
“ He ain’t no dog o’ mine,” protested Benno,
disclaiming all responsibility.
“ I gave him er dose this mornin’,” explained
the Don—“all I had, but it didn’t seem t’ do
him no good ; so I thought I’d fit him here with
er fatal charge. Look out ! ”
Benno followed Don in a dash for the counter.
The dog had changed his manoeuvres. He was
how racing round the Walls of the shop, chop-
ping at things as he passed. He overturned the
chairs, and brought doW'n a small show-stand
W ith a crash. The chemist joined Don and Dick-
son on the counter.
PEACEFUL EXPEDIENTS.
DISGUSTED PERSON IN THE CROWD (after six rounds of very fancy sparring): “’ Ere , go
away an ’ settle it at the Arbitration Court.”
“ Stop him ! ” stuttered Squills. “ He’ll
wreck the shop. For Heaven’s sake, stop him ! ”
“ Stop yer Aunt Martha,” retorted Nicholas,
bitterly. “ ’Ow in thunder ’m I goin’ t’ stop
him ? Lorblime, he’d bite ther leg off yeh ! ”
Carlo made frantic excursions up the wall.
Lie bit madly. The froth flew from him, but he
made no sound till he got among the crockery.
He had to swarm over the counter to do that,
and he crashed into a show case by the way,
floundered out, and tore about a cwt. of phials
off the shelves. For two minutes he raged
up and down behind the scenes, overturning
gallons of physic. Then he took the counter in a
leap again, revolved three times, and stiffened out
in the middle of the floor, and there was a great
silence for 30sec.
“Jimmy Gee !” murmured Nicholas, gazing at
the ruin, “ here’s er tub iv trouble.”
“ Mind,” protested Benno feebly, “ he ain’t no
dog iv mine, ’n’ I can prove it.” Benno edged
towards the door. Nicholas seemed disposed to
follow, but the chemist wouldn’t hear of it.
“ No, you don’t,” he said intervening, “ who’s
to pay for all this ? ”
The discussion that followed was conducted
with a good deal of warmth, but eventually
Squills agreed to try his claim on Odgson and
Co., 11 Egg-lane, City, before going to legal ex-
tremes with Nicholas Don and Mr. Dickson. A
more or less unsatisfactory conclusion having been
arrived at, the friends again turned to depart.
“ Here, here, hold hard,” said Squills, “ what
about the dog ? ”
“We throw the dog in,” said the Don, with a
lamentable attempt at levity.
“ You do NOT ! I like your cast-iron cheek,
hauling your infernal mongrel in here to die, and
wanting to leave the corpse on my hands. You 11
hike it out of this, or I’ll call the police.”
“ Come along, Benno,” said Nick, hope-
lessly ; “ take er holt. Grab his rudder.”
Nicholas Don gripped the carcase by the neck.
Benno took it by the tail. The two marched out
with their burden, and labored down the street.
It was a trying task they had in hand, and most
ignominious. No young man of the superior
classes, with a proper respect for himself, cares to
be seen passing through town bearing the loathly
carcase of a dog, and it must not be forgotten
that Benno was a clerk, and a man with a position
to maintain. He felt degraded. People passed
remarks. Two or three small boys raised a
“hoy!” Then a ragamuffinly football team,
passing in a van, discovered the hapless pair with
the cadaver, and they yelled like demons.
“ ’Elio, Ned ! Gettin’ ’ome with the week’s
meat ? ” roared a hardened barracker, and the
van passed with howls of laughter and a volley of
insults.
Benno dropped his end of the dog. “Jimmy
Gee !” he wailed, “ here’s er sweet thing yiv let
me in fer. What iv I got t’ do with yer blighted
dog? This is where I duck out.”
“ Oh, come, I say, ez er man iv honor, yeh
can’t do that,” answered Nicholas Don reproach-
fully. “Yer in this now. Yiv got t’ see it
through.”
“ Didn’ I tell yeh I’ve got a meet? Er bloke
can’t keep er lady waitin’.”
“ Don’t have it on yer mind,” said the Don
with great decision. His manner implied that he
would regard the dereliction of Benno as a
personal affront calling for instant action.
At this point a fat policeman arrived on the
scene. He regarded the three with grave sus-
picion. “What is it y’ ’ave there ? ” said he.
“ What is it ! ” retorted the Don, with bitter-
ness. “ Come closer, Charles, ’n’ inspect. It’s
ther missin’ jewels.”
“No lip, meson,” said the Law. The constable
placed a foot on the dog, and pushed it inquisi-
tively. “ It’s a dog,” he said, “a dead wan.”
“No use, Benno,” murmured the Don in
despair, “yeh can hide nothin’ from a cunnin’
devil like this. We own up,” he added, address-
ing the officer, “ it’s er dorg all right, ’n’ its per-
manently dead.”
“D’yeh know,” said the policeman severely,
“ I could run yiz in fer bein’ in possession of pro-
perty raysonably supposed to have been stolen ?
Take it out o’ this.”
“ But where en ’ell ’re we t’take it?” cried
Nicholas.
“ Devil er man o’ me knows. Try th’ Zoo.
If yeh lave it round th’ towm yer li’ble to penal-
ties made ’n’ provided.”
The pair resumed their burden and their march.
A few boys who had been drawn to them tagged
behind with an air of lively expectation. A
hansom driver yelled something in passing to the
effect that they might try it boiled, and a publican
asked them if they were taking it home for the
cat. Most of the passing strangers had something
funny to say. All grinned. Benno dropped his
end again.
“ ’Ere, ’ere ! ” he said. “ Gimme the ’ead end ;
its less ridiculous.”
“ Lorblime ! ther pride iv him ! ” commented
the Don ; but he consented to the change.
“ By ther way,” asked the clerk, “ what are
we goin’t’ do with him ? ”
“Dunno,” answered Nicholas, hopelessly. A
bright idea struck him. “ D’yeh want er dorg?”
he said, addressing one of the expectant small
boys. “ A beautiful dorg,” he added persuasively ;
“ brings sticks outer ther water ’n’ steals
chickens.”
“ Garn !” said the grimy youth—“ he’s dead.”
“ Oh, no he ain’t,” Nicholas assured him ;
‘ 1 he’s only fainted. ”
But the boys were not enterprising. They
refused to take over the dog even when assured
that his hide and bones were worth seven shillings.
Nicholas Don and Mr. Dickson next tried
to put the corpse on a tram, with the idea
of delivering it at the Zoo, but were hounded off
by an infuriated conductor.
Nicholas had another inspiration when passing
a hay and corn store. “ I got it,” he said. “ I’ll
dip in here ’n’ buy er sack. P’raps we’ll be able
t’ leave him round somewhere if he’s disguised.”
Nicholas dipped in. Benno guarded the dog
for five minutes, and then the usual policeman
arrived and urged him to move on with the offen-
sive remains. Mr. Dickson explained, and the
officer entered the store to hasten the Don’s
efforts, but returned presently with important in-
formation. The Don was not there. The vil-
lainous Nicholas had sneaked out by a back way,
leaving Benno in sole possession of the dog’s
body. Dickson's fury was frightful to see. Lie
used language that would have got him ten hours
had not the policeman been a man of sentiment
and sympathy.
“ Annyway, ye must shift th’ cor-r-rpse,” said
the constable. He added, confidentially : “ ’N’
I wouldn't be kapin’ him by me too long this
warum weather.”
The policeman purchased a chaff-bag with
Benno’s money, and assisted the indignant and
harassed clerk to push the dog in. The animal
had stiffened, and it was not easy to bag him.
Fifty-seven people watched the operation with
great interest. Fifteen of them followed Benno
some distance as he tottered away with his bag of
dog. The policeman was careful to see the
cadaver off his beat. Mr. Dickson arrived before
a pub in a side street, hot and despairing. He
dropped his bag, and, entering the bar with a
stagger, called for a long shandy. He drank
deeply, and was refreshed and consoled. His
magnificent brain got to work. Here w’as a
chance to break with that horrible dog. He
would escape by the side door, as Nicholas had
done, leaving the defunct tyke to the corporation.
Benno finished his drink, and was making for the
safe exit, when a policeman entered from the
street.
“ Hi, you ! ” cried the Law. “ There’s a bit
of a dog waiting. Don’t forget the dog.” He
gripped Benno, and led him into the street. The
dog was there, lying stark and stiff on the pave-
ment. Benno uttered a wail of pure anguish.
Somebody had stolen the bag !
From the publican Benjamin Dickson purchased
another sack, and went on again, staggering under
his woeful burden. That-policeman also saw him
off his beat. Another policeman saw him care-
fully the whole length of the next beat. Never
had Benno met so many policemen. Several
times he tried to rid himself of the canine incubus,
hut he failed in his purpose. Once when he
dropped the deceased among a lot of cases in a
yard behind an ironmongery, and fled, a splenetic
man chased him up the lane, captured him, and
skull-dragged him all the way back. Benno was
forced to take up the sack of remains again, and
was then kicked off the premises. The coward
kicked Benno with the child in his arms —kicked
him nine times.
Blessed release came all in a moment. Benno
came upon a doctor’s motor standing unguarded,
and a desperate idea struck him. Made reckless
by his misery, he marched boldly to the motor,
dropped the body into the back compartment, and
walked away. Turning the first corner trepida-
tion seized him, and he ran a mile.
Terrible was Benno’s scorn, bitter his re-
proaches when he confronted Nicholas Don at the
warehouse on Monday morning.
“ It’s no use buckin’ up, Benno,” said the Don.
“ I wasn’t responsible fer me actions. I had er
kind iv kidney fit in ther ’ay ’n’ corn, ’n ther
blokes carried me t’ ther pub fer stimulants. Any-
way cut it out ; I got troubles enough iv me own.
Wait till Spats sees ther bill from Squills. Jimmy
Gee, won’t he pig-jump ! ”
Nicholas was correct in his anticipations.
Odgson was furious when the chemist’s account
came to hand. He went at the Don in a series of
hops, barking. There were flecks of froth on his
whiskers.
But this was not the end. Nicholas came
upstairs to Benno on the Tuesday afternoon,
looking like a man haunted.
“’Ell V Tommy!” he said, “here’s er
blighted mess. That dorg we killed ”
“ We killed ! ” interrupted Benno, in a squeal.
“We killed ! Oh, I like that, I don’t think.
WE killed ! ”
“Well,” continued the Don, waiving Benno’s
repudiation, “it appears it’s the wrong dorg.”
“The w'rong ” Benno was unequal to
the occasion. He collapsed mentally.
“The wrong dorg ! Ther dorg what’s bin
givin’ Odgson’s people all ther troub’ ez turned
up agin’, ’n’ he’s sweatin’ ther cat ’n’ sleepin’ on
the beds same ez heretofore. It turns out ther
dorg we killed belonged to Packthro, Odgson’s
neighbor, ’n’ he was a Great Dane, ’n’ worth
twenty quid. At any rate, Packthro’s rushin’ you
’n’ me fer tw’enty quid compensation.”
Benno’s small face was very white. His body
was as limp as a damp duster. He stared at
Nicholas in stupid dismay.
FRIGHTENED.
SHE (timidly): “Tm terrible frightened,
HE (wonderingly): “ Frightened! Wit of?"
SHE (shyly): “ Frightened you—you might kiss
me.”
HE: “Wot! With this ’ere pig in me arms! ”
SHE: “ Pm frightened you might put it under
the tub.”
“ Blime ! Don’t perch there like er para-
lytic hen,” yelled the Don. “ What yer goin’t
do about it ? ”
Benno opened his mouth feebly. “Twenty
quid!” he whispered. “ Twen’ ” Then
he fell off his high stool and lay huddled upon the
floor.

MR. JONES AS A SPORT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
IT was the morning of Romahapa Cup Day,
and at Puketapu Junction the staff, in common
with the rest of the town, was in a state of
feverish excitement. For weeks it had been
brewing, and now, on the morning of the eventful
day, plain undiluted frenzy reigned. With the
exception of the two Salvationists in the Goods
Shed, the whole staff (Traffic, Locomotive and
Maintenance) argued and disputed as to what the
various syndicates should back, and whether the
money should go on “inside” or “outside.”
There was only half-an-hour in which to decide,
for Jones was going to Romahapa by No. 7, and
was to take charge of the “splosh” and the
investment thereof.
The most excited person in the place was
Manners, the Stationmaster. He had “ inside ”
information from a sporting squatter, who was
supposed to belong to the innermost ring, and
when the squatter gave Manners the tip, he
assured him it was a true and faithful promise,
and begged him to mortgage all his worldly posses-
sions, execute a lien on his underclothing, borrow
the office cash, and “ whack ” it all on Nelson for
the Cup. Nothing else mattered.
As it was impossible for Manners to leave his
station, he agreed that the next best thing he
could do would be to entrust Mr. Jones with the
money and the secret. Knowing Jones’s tendency
to plunge horribly in a moment of enthusiasm or
abstraction, he strove to conceal from him that he
bad any special reason for supposing that Nelson
would win, otherwise the emissary would be sure
to draw a cheque and swamp both machines,
“ inside ” and “ out.”
The question of “ inside ” or “ out ” was alw'ays
a vexed one. The “inside” totalisator was the
one on the lawn, where the plutocracy paid £1
for its ticket, and the other was the one to which
the lower orders bad access, and which sold its
tickets for half a sovereign. The difference in
the dividends paid by the two machines on the
same race was sometimes enormous, and with
men who had to trust to friends to invest their
money, the question 4 4 Which machine ?” was always
a worry. If they left it to their friends, the
money invariably got on the' tote which paid the
smaller dividend. Jones had notified all intending
speculators that he would take charge of any amount
of money, but they must stipulate what horses
they wanted backed, and on which machine.
There were three syndicates at Puketapu. The
-locomotive men had formed one of their own ; the
shunters and porters had another, although it was
a very little one. The maintenance syndicate was
understood to be a huge-affair, representing the
accumulated savings of about 30 men for three
months.
No. 7 left at 9.15, and at 8.30 the question of
which horse and machine was still undecided.
Jones was in the office, making out his ticket
return in a huge hurry, when a member of the
loco, syndicate slunk in. He explained that they
were hopelessly divided, and, being unable to
agree, had decided to leave the whole matter to
his (Mr. Jones’s) decision. As for which tote,
well, they knew if they left it to Mr. Jones he
would do the best he could for them.
Jones looked pleased. He signed the P 6 return
with a huge 'flourish, and expectorated with
unerring accuracy on to the bulldog in the corner.
Mr. Jones was subject to fits of politeness, and
one of them had him just then. He lifted his eyes
to the ceiling and thought hard, and then, in a
soft voice, remarked :
44 While I am deeply sensible of the honor that
has been done me in this matter, I think it would
be better sport if your people decided the ques-
tions for themselves. For the Cup, there is, lam
most credibly informed, nothing worthy of con-
sideration but Nelson, with Sarpedon as a saver.
I shall back both the cows myself. Of course
only God and the devils who ride ’em know if
they are really trying, but if they are jigging, then
I apprehend no danger from any quarter what-
soever.”
Then Jones looked round for the bulldog ; but,
finding that it had left, he walked outside to the edge
of the platform. Jones was a most charming man
when suffering from a bad attack of politeness.
44 All ri’,” said the loco. man. “ Here’s eight
pun’, put £3 on Nelson on both machines, and a
quid on Sarpedon on both machines, and then we
simply must strike it, eh ? ”
“Righto. I don’t think you can do better,”
said Mr. Jones, walking back into the office, where
Manners inquired what was his fancy.
“Well, personally, I feel morally certain that
Nelson is going to win. There is some danger
that Sarpedon may come with one of those light-
ning rushes of his, and pip him on the post, but it
is a danger that can be allowed for by investing a
solitary ticket on the brute. Of course,” he added
with sudden inspiration, “there’s always the
chance that someone has got ’em both in the bag.
I’m told there was some very tall betting last
night ; and there’s a dangerous-looking outsider
with only 6st. 7lb. up, that may cut in just when
he can hurt most.”
The Stationmaster looked at him in perplexity.
44 Well,” he said at last, 44 I’ve got £4 to
speculate, and I want to win no matter what
happens, so tell me the best way to split it up.”
But Jones shook himself and started to make
out a parcels invoice.
“ I’ll tell you what : I’ll put a quid on both
Nelson and Sarpedon on each machine, and then
if either of ’em wins I’ll come out clear.”
“ Might not; depends on how the public
rushes ’em. Don’t suppose we’re the only men
who know something.”
“ And if your 6st. 7lb. brute comes home we’ll
lose the lot.”
The Stationmaster went off to get the money,
and Egerton, the porter, sidled in. He wore his
service cap on the back of his head and a leer on
the front of his face.
“ I’ve formed a little shindy-what-you-call-it of
me own, with them psalm-singing blokes in the
Goods. Don’t put ’em away. I’m supposed to
tell yer it’s all me own, but I can’t tell a lie.”
“ Heavens ! ” gasped Jones.
“No,” said Egerton, “ I can't. Here's thirty
bob. Slap it on where you like and how you
like. We’re followin’ you. And here’s the two
quid from the other crowd, an’ a list tellin’ you
how to fix it.”
Jones swept list and money into his pocket, and
as Egerton went out, McCracken, the northern
ganger, came in. He carried his hat in his hand,
and, laying it on the table, unfolded it cautiously.
It contained a lot of loose and rather small silver,
the contents of money-boxes kept for this de-
generate day.
“We heard you was goin’ down, Mr. Jones,
an’ thought we’d ask you if you would be so kind
as to put it on for us. We fancy Gilderoy for the
Cup, Rangitira for the Plate, and we leaves it to
you as to which machine to put it on.”
‘ ‘ What on earth makes you fancy Gilderoy for
the Cup ? ” asked Jones.
Manners groaned. Was this fool going to put
everybody on to the good thing?
“Well, Bill Smith's
sister is married on to a
brother of Coxon’s, the
jockey what’s ridin’ ’im,
an’ ’e says he’s goin’ to win. I dunno ! ”
“ All right, how mueh is here ? ”
“ Eight pun’ among 16 of us.”
‘ ‘ I’ll want- a truck to carry the cash presently.
Look at me pockets bulging like a bookmaker’s
on the journey home.”
Then No. 7 rushed into the platform, and Jones,
grabbing his overcoat and a gold-mounted walking
cane that the residents of his last place had pre-
sented to Manners, swung himself on board the
first-class smoker.
Just as the train was moving out, Mollison, the
southern ganger, rushed on to the platform and
into the office. He bawled for Mr. Jones.
“ Shut your head ! ” hissed the Stationmaster.
“ What do you mean by making that row on my
station ? ” r
“ Where’s Mr. Jones? ” roared Mollison like a
motherless calf; and then he caught sight of a bull
countenance beaming at a barmaid in the refresh-
ment rooms from the window of a first-class
smoker.
The train was moving, and Mollison’s right
hand was full of money, but he tried it all the
same. It was a great spring—too great in fact,
for Mollison landed on the front platform of the
carriage all right, turned gracefully over, and dis-
appeared down the embankment, having shot
right across.
The passengers gulped back their hearts, and
shook their fists, and swore at him through the
window. “ I’ll bet he had some money for me to
put on the tote ! ” said Jones, and his remark at
once created an intense sympathy for the unlucky
sport.
At Tui Swamp Jones received a rather frantic
telegraphic memo from Manners :
“ You’ve gone off without my money after all.
Please invest £4. as I stated, will give you cheque
to-night when you return.”
Tones sent a reply that he would, and made
another note at the bottom of the long list of
things he was to do.
At Ocean Head he received another wire, this
time from Mollison :—•
“ Please put £2 on Whakatane for Hurdles
and 30s. on Somerset for the Cup, two pounds
on Sarpedon for Plate, and one pound on any-
thing you fancy yourself. Money coming by
express. Mollison and Gang.”
Jones replied that he would.
When Jones stepped off the train on to the plat-
form at Romahapa he dived into the Booking
Office to cash a cheque. But for the two wires
he had received en route he would have had
enough ready money to see him through, and would
have darted across the platform into a cab, and
away, for when a railway man is on railway
premises or territory he is on duty.
Having cashed his cheque, he slipped out of
the Booking Office in a surreptitious sort of
manner, and dived round the corner towards the
cab-rank, right into the arms of Fluter, the tall
Traffic Clerk.
“Great Caesar!” gasped the Traffic Clerk,
grasping Jones by the shoulder ; “ this IS luck.
Here I’ve been puzzling my brains all day won-
dering who to put into the telegraph-room to cope
with the rush, and you spring up. Hooray ! Go
straight over, and take charge. I’m ”
“Charge be damned ! ” shouted Jones. “ I’m
goin’ to the races.”
“You mean you were going,” said Fluter,
sternly. “ Very sorry, but I simply cannot spare
you.”
“ Well, how’d you have done if I hadn’t been
here ? ”
“I’m darned if I know. Hurry over, like a
good fellow.”
“ Oh, I say. Look here. I’m loaded up with
gonce —stuff they want put on the tote. I simply
must go out —it’s a matter of honor—it’s other
men’s oof.”
“ Well, I can’t help that:. It is quite impossi-
ble. You simply can’t go. They will be darned
thankful you couldn’t when the races are over,
anyhow.”
“Well, I’ll go out and put their money on, and
then come right in.”
The Traffic Clerk turned. He seemed to loom
taller than ever.
“ Mr. Jones, I insist on your going on duty at
once —immediately, sir. lam astonished that an
officer with your experience should behave in
such a manner.. It is subversive of all discipline.”
Jones turned his face towards the Traffic Office
with a curse. Here was a pretty kettle of fish.
He arrived at the telegraph-room of the Traffic
Office, and assumed charge. Then he broke out
into a fit of cursing that blistered the walls. In
the intervals of rushing off train-running tele-
grams, he rang up the S.M. Romahapa and in-
quired who were the guards that were taking the
trains out to the racecourse.
“ Oh, the Devil burst you and the guards too —
how on earth can I tell?” howled the sub-S.M.
“ By looking at the book ! ” roared Jones.
“ Do you think I've nothing else to do on a
race day but fool about getting guards’ names for
you—damn your impudence ! ” Then the bell
buzzed wildly in Jones’ ear.
He rang up again and asked for the Booking
Clerk.
“ That you, Bob ? Jones speaking. Got a ton
of other fellows’ splosh to put on the tote. Who’s
going ’out ? ”
“Oh! Well, I don’t know. What about
giving it to Gow. Tell him exactly what you
want done, chuck him half a sov. and he’ll
manage it somehow. But be sure and tell him
where to invest it, or he’ll mix it up. He don’t
understand totes. I’ll send him over. S’long ! ”
“ Righto ! I say, back Nelson, with Sarpedon
for an outsider. ”
“No dashed fear. Mortiboy will donkey-lick
the pair. S’long ! ”
Ten minutes later Gow thrust a red face sur-
reptitiously inside the telegraph-room door.
Jones handed him a list and a huge accumulation
of cash, which Gow checked with the figures on
the paper in a business-like manner.
“ Ten bob too much, Mr. Jones.”
“ Your admission, or, if you have a ticket, your
commission.”
“ Thank you kindly, sir. I’ll attend to it soon
as I get out.”
“Now, don’t forget, Gow, that it all goes on
the outside with the exception of £2 , which you
will put on Sarpedon and Nelson inside respect-
ively. Gow looked so puzzled that Jones was
thankful he hadn’t asked him to undertake any-
thing more complicated. He repeated his in-
structions twice, and then disappeared in the
same surreptitious manner in which he had
entered.
“He’ll muck it up!” said Millar, the tele-
graphist.
The Cup started at 3.10. About five minutes
before the time Gow sneaked into the office and
brought Jones to his feet with an oath.
“ What the are you doing here ? Surely
you didn’t go an’ put all that money into some
agent’s hands ? ”
“ Naw, I give it an’ the list to Billy Stafford.
The ‘ Most Perfect,’ he sez to me, sez he, ‘ Gow,
yer’d better stay here an’ help to keep things goin’
right with them ’orse-boxes.’ There wasn’t no
time to see yer, so I skips over to No. 4 Platform
and gives it to Billy Stafford, an’ he’ll give it to
Sinclair, the flagman at the Course Gates, and
Sine.’ll get it on somehow. It’s writ very plain,
so he can’t go wrong.’
Jones groaned ! Then the wires slowed down,
and all became very still. Only Jones worked.
He poured into the aching ear of Manners the
sort of catastrophe that had struck them. Manners
maintained a gloomy silence.
“ I suppose some beast will pocket the lot ! ”
he said at last.
“ I expect so ! ” said Jones, in a sudden burst
of rage. Then Bob, the Booking Clerk, rang up,
and Jones placed the sounder to his ear.
‘ ‘ Sinclair reports that he got the money on all
right, as per instructions. He also reports that
Nelson walked in, with Sarpedon’s teeth in his
tail. How’ve you come out ? ”
“ Hear anything about the divs ? ”
“Yes, £$ inside, and eighty lovely quid out-
side.”
“What?” yelled Jones. “How much out-
side ? ”
“Eighty! Good, isn’t it ? They were all on
Sarpedon.”
“ Bob,” said Jones, with a break in his voice,
“send out for a bottle of champagne for every-
body in the office, and I’ll pay for it. Bob, this
is too much ! God is very good !’’
‘ ‘ Right ! ” said Bob, ringing off.
Then Jones telegraphed the result to Manners.
Next day he learned from the cadet that when
Manners heard it he took off his hat, placed the
hand that held it across his bosom, lifted his other
hand above his head, and stared devoutly at the
ceiling for several seconds, murmuring :
“Eighty-five pounds. Oh Lord, how beauti-
ful ! ”
Half-an-hour later Manners called up once more:
‘‘ Be sure and return to-night. Great spread at
the Northern. Have ordered champagne. Come
by No. 32 whether you get the money or not.
Suppose it can’t go wrong ? ”
“ Oh, no, it’s safe enough ! I’ll be there ! ”
***■*•
They had a glorious night at Puketapu, and the
whole company walked round for about two hours
in the misty moonlight of the early morning,
seeing one another home. By that time the
engines were moving about the railway yard, and
the lad-porter was sweeping down the platform.
Jones took the S.M. by the arm.
“ Mannersh, old fellow, yo’ go’me. You’ve
gotter wife t’ cherish. I’ll see the blessed
trainsh off. Yo’ go’me look after family—l’m lone
han’, Mannersh, ole boy ! ”
“ No, Jonsh, yo’ drunksh. Hold me upsh an’
I’ll saveyo’ bein’ sackshedfor (hie) bein’ drunk on
duty. Eighty-five p’un’, Oh Lordsh, watcher
timsh we’ll have ! Go’ome, Jonsh, yo’ drunk,
damned drunksh ! ”
Jones staggered round to the yard of the hotel.
The stable boy was pumping water for the horses.
Jones arrived :
“ Hold onsh I wanttef get head under.”
The grinning lad stopped pumping, while Jones
gripped it and got the back of his neck under the
spout.
“ Now letter go, Gallaghersh ?”
Gallagher did, and an awful roar went over the
town as the icy cold water gushed over Jones’
head and ran down between his skin and his
clothes. He staggered away, holding his head,
uncertain if he was scalded or frozen. For about
two minutes he roamed found holding on to
himself, getting rapidly sober. Then he looked
for the stable boy, but that youth had disappeared.
He climbed upstairs, dried himself and re-
dressed, and then went over to the station, where
he found Manners fast asleep in the lamp room.
With great difficulty he got his superior officer
into his own den, where he curled up on the sofa,
and sternly declined to take any interest in any-
thing for several hours.
About 11 a. m. he awoke. It was the noise of
a mob of pigs being driven past that had aroused
him, and he staggered to his feet with a distinct
impression that he had forgotten to order a truck
for thdse pigs. He walked unsteadily into the
outer office, and found that the noise emanated
from Jones, who,/having gone to sleep on the
telegraph table, had rolled on to his back.
V Here, wake up ! You’re blocking the tele-
graph instrument. Confound it, what the Devil
do you mean by blocking the sounder ? ”
Jones rolled off the table. The instrument
immediately started to call Puketapu.
“ There yer are,” snorted the S.M., “calling
us for God knows how long.”
“ Well, see what the they want,” said
Jones sleepily, his polite fit having about worn off.
The instrument clicked, and Jones suddenly
became interested. It was from Bob, the Book-
ing Clerk.
“ Sorry to say Stafford lost paper of instruc-
tions, and put all the money on inside and ex-
cept two quid it was all on Sarpedon. Terrible
hash. Sending all his tickets and £\o cash for-
ward to you. Stafford infernal goat. Awfully
sorry. Bob.”
Jones looked at Manners keenty. Manners
stared at the paper, and then, raising both his
hands above his head, called down on Stafford,
his ancestors, female progenitors, and his descend-
ants unto the thirteenth generation, the most
elaborate set of misfortunes that Providence ever
dispensed to a suffering race.

Wallaby Walker’s Will.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
WALLABY WALKER, mean old miser,
Dwelt at Golden Hill.
Never a man, ’twas said, was wiser.
Some folk say so still !
He’d observe : “ It’s this way, Sonny ;
Fools can make a pile,
But a wise man keeps his money !
Then he’d wink and smile !
Wallaby Walker, still unmarried,
Flad the queerest ways ;
Told us how his swag he’d carried
“ In the early days.”
Ever toiling hard and hoarding,
Piling pelf on pelf.
He had never thought of boarding ;
Always “batched” himself !
By his social isolation
Early he began
To acquire the reputation
Of a wealthy man.
Many a widow beamed upon him.
Many a damsel fair
Threw her charming glances on him
With a roguish air !
One there was, and you would think her
Just the one to do,
Emily Jane Theresa Blinker —
Tall and twenty-two.
Handsome girl, and no great talker,
Solid sense had she—
Just the wife for Wallaby Walker,
Who was sixty-three !
Some declare ’twas her suggestion ;
Nasty thing to say !
We’ll suppose he popped the question
In the good old way !
Anyhow, the pair were married,
Bound for years to come,
And in deadly dulness tarried
In the miser’s home !
Emily Jane, whose hopes were fervent
Of much future joy,
Found that she was wife and servant,
Nurse and errand boy !
Though the miser rarely parted
With the smallest sum,
Emily Jane remained light-hearted —
Brighter days would come !
Why she needed small persuasion
To he patient still
Was that he, on one occasion,
Showed his wife his will !
Though her life at times would grieve her
Almost past all bounds,
By his will she saw he’d leave her
Fifty Thousand Pounds !
Thirteen years they lived together ;
She was thirty-five,
And began to wonder whether
He or she’d survive !
Then, without a moment’s warning,
He went off the hooks !
Found stone dead in bed one morning !
Gone to join the spooks !
Well, you know, ’twas not fair dinkum
To a patient wife.
Walker merely had an income
Purchased for his life !
It was sixty pounds per annum,
Barely bread and cheese !
Just about enough for panem ,
Minus circenses!
Every story, to be healthy,
Needs a moral, and
Misers are not always wealthy,
You will understand.
And if May would wed December
“ For position,” still
’Twould not hurt her to remember
Wallaby Walker’s Will !
N.S.W.

Mr. Barnes’ Abstinence.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“ is a funny world,” observed Mr.
Barnes sadly, “an’ yet it ain’t so very
funny neither. Them as has money has
as much trouble as them as hasn't—on’y it’s a
diff’rent sorter trouble—not so troublesome like.
“ There was the case o’ me old mate, Jerry
Lane. ’E’s dead now, poor bloke, though he
used not to be. ’E wuz al’us hard-up—like me,
an’ al’us thirsty like me— now.
“Thanks —I don’t mind if I do. Yes, Jerry
an’ me wuz al’us be’ind the game some’ow, till his
Uncle Tim died an’ left ’im a farm at Williyup.
We were at Gaskar Crik when we got word o’ the
windfall. It wuz one hot ev’nin’, an’ we wuz all at
Sly Mike’s pub, as usual, when the coach drove
up. ‘ Got something inside ’ere for you, Jerry,"
sed the driver.
“ ‘ Whoop,’ yelled me mate. ‘ It’s the case o’
beer George Stamp promised to send me.’
“ ‘ Nary,’ sed the driver, ‘ it’s drier’n beer.’
“Just then, from the inside o’ the coach, jumps
a little man with a white collar and eye-glasses.
‘ Good grashus,’ ’e sez, ‘ what a wild-lookin’
place ! ’
“ He looked round at all of us.
“ ‘ Good grashus !’ ’e sez again. ‘ Could any
of you gentlemen inform me where I can find Mr.
Lane—Mr. J. Lane ? I’ve something important
to tell him. His uncle Timothy’s died an’ left
’im ’is farm.’
“ ‘ W-what ! ’ stammered Jerry. ‘ Say it agen.
“‘Mr. T. Lane, of Williyup, died last week,
and ’as left all ’is property to ’is nephew Jerry.
I am the diseased man’s solicitor, and ’ave traced
the heir ’ere. Good grashus ! Which is him ? ”
“ ‘Hooray ! I’m ’im,’ said Jerry.
“Well, to cut it short, talkin’ bein’ dry work,
200 acres' an’ a house, an’ cows, an’ pigs, an’
things, an’ in the hank was what was
cornin’ to Jerry. We danced round ’ugging each
other. Then we hugged the little lawyer-cove.
it < streuth,’ panted Jerry, when ’e got is wind
HAD NO USE FOE HIM.
COCKY : “ Yes, I want a useful man about the place. What can ye do ?”
THE SEARCHER : “ Well, larst place I was at I uster do the ploughin', harrowin', milk
ther cows, feed the calves, cut chaff, cart wood, etcetery, besides doin' the workin'
and lookin' after the vegetable garden, and if I 'ad time on a Sunday I washed
up the dishes."
COCKY : “ If you were usefid why did the boss sack you?"
THE SEARCHER: “ Well, yer see, he didn't want me any more after he got married!"
back, ‘ I thought you was a case o’ beer, an’ you
turn out to be a flamin’ Santy Claws. Two hundred
acres! 350 quids ! Why it’s too good to be true.’
“ That’s where Jerry was wrong. It was too
true to be good.
“ ‘ Jest a moment,’ sed the lawyer, when ’e ’ad
straightened himself arter our embraces. .‘ There
are two conditions to your uncle’s will. For the
first 12 months you are to be allowed only 30s.
per week. You cannot sell the farm or anything
belonging to it, nor touch the money in the bank
for that period.
“ ‘ That’s easy,’ sed Jerry ; ‘ lead me to it.’
“‘The other condition,’ continued the little
lawyer, ‘is as follers : Your late demented rela-
tive was a teetot’ler ’
“ ’Streuth ! ’ we both gasped.
“ An’ ,’e insists that you give up all strong
liquor an’ drink only tea an’ milk an’ sich ’——
“ ‘ What! ’ screamed Jerry, jumpin’ up wildly.
‘ Tea ! Milk ! Me ! To ’ell with you an’ yer 200
acres. You can cut the flamin’ cows up fer fire-
wood. Milk ! Brrrh ! ’
“ ‘Good grashus ! Calm yerself,’ stammered
the little bloke, ‘I am not responsible. My duty is
to acquaint you with the terms of your uncle’s will.’
“ ‘ Get on,’ moaned Jerry. ‘ Tell me the worst.’
“ ‘You must sign the pledge,’ sed the lawyer,
‘ an’ the first drop o’ drink you take will disin-
herit yon.’
‘ ‘ There wuz a deep silence for some time.
“ ‘ >Ow —’ow are you going to find out if I
drink?’ asked Jerry. ‘Your late demented
uncle,’ went on the lawyer, ‘ ’ad an old ’ouse-
keeper, a Mrs. Wright, who ’as been with ’im for
25 years. In the event of your failin’ to observe
the strict terms of the will, the estate passes to ’er.
She is to stay on in the ’ouse as before. More-
over, for the first 12 months you are not to leave
the district, and if you are seen entering or leaving
an hotel you will be disinherited.’
“Jerry looked at me with a face like an empty
jam-tin.
“ ‘ When do I have to take it on ? ’ ’e asked.
“ ‘ I want you to return with me on the coach
to-morrow,’ answers the lawyer.
“ ‘ Not me ! ’ yelled Jerry, ‘ You can give yer
farm to the dogs.’
“‘Gam,’ sed I. ‘ Pull yerself together. Be
Vman. If I ’ad a chance like that, not all the beer
in the world ’ud stop me. After all, what is beer ? ’
“ ‘ Can I bring me mate along ? ’ asked Jerry.
“ ‘ Yes, there can be no objection to that,’ sed
the lawyer. ‘ But the same conditions will apply
to ’im while ’e lives with you,’
“ ‘ Help ! ’ I yelled. ‘ I stay right ’ere.’
“Jerry flew off at me at that, and called me all
sorts o’ things, so that I ad to deal with im.
‘ ‘ When our argument was concluded and we
’ad enticed the little man down from the tree
where he ’ad been shelterin’, we settled down to
discuss the matter thoroughly. After the lawyer
had gone to get diggings at Sly Mike s, Jerr).
me discussed it some .more, an thought an
thought. Finally, we decided fer’im to take it
on. I wuz to go an’ live with im.
“ ‘We’ll find some way o’ beatin’ em,’ I sez
’opefully.
“ Four days later we arrove at Williyup. We
wuz shown over the farm by the ousekeepei,
Mrs. Wright. She wuz a sour-faced ole gal, with
one tooth that stuck up from her lower jaw like a
tombstone. . , ,
“‘She’s a pretty ancient, ivy-clad rum, sed
Jerry. ‘ P’raps she’ll croak soon.’
“ 1 Get it outer yer mind,’ I told ’im. ‘ She
ain’t the dyin’ sort. All wire an’ obstinateness.
She’ll live for ever, if only to nark yer,’
“ The farm, though, was a clinker ! Lots o’
cows an’ pigs an’ ’aystacks an’ things. The ’ouse
wus a mansion—four rooms an’ a wash’ouse —a
palace of a place. Real beds there wuz, an’ orse-
’air chairs —real toffy—an’ picters in lovely gold
frames on the walls. I tell yer Jerry’s ’ead
swelled visibly. ‘All mine ! ’ ’e muttered to
’imself as ’e went round proddin’ the cows an’ the
pigs jist to let’m know ’OO ’e wuz, sorter like.
“We rounded up a couple o’ nags an’ rode
about the place. Jerry, who wuz givin’ ’imself
airs an’ me a stomach-ache with ’is lord-o’-the-
manor style, wuz chock full o’ schemes for im-
provements. You'd think ’e wuz Tyson the way
’e talked.
“ ‘What a purty little racecourse I could make
outer that there paddock,’ ’e would say, or
‘ That there colt looks sif ’e ’ad a turn o’ pace in
’im.’ In the fowl-yard ’e picked out a young
rooster what ’e reckoned could put up a pretty
rapid scrap with a bit o’ trainin’. An old collie
bitch, ’e sed, looked sif she’d make a great sportin’
dorg. Jerry was a sport to the marrow.
“We rode into'the township later on an’ ’ad a
look roun’.
“ There wuz a brace o’ slap-up pubs. We
examined ’em from the outside. Jerry wuz that
frightened o’ losin’ ’is beautiful farm that ’e
wouldn’t even let his ’orse drink outer the trough
in fronter one of ’em. We wuz terrible thirsty—
we al’us were—so we ptilled up at the store
an’ ’ad a—a lemon-
ade each.
“ ‘ Put it down
to me—Mr. Lane is
me name,’ sed Jerry
in a lordly way. You
should ’ave seen
the storekeeper throw
fits round us an’ bow
us out. Jerry kidded
’imself no end.
“ When we got
’ome, tea wuz ready.
Whatever else wuz
goin’ to ’appen, the
sour-faced ’ouse-keep-
er didn’t mean to
starve us. Cold mut-
ton an’ sossidges an’
jam an’ eggs an’ per-
taters —all the luxur-
ies y’ can think on.
There wuz two big
jugs on the table.
Jerry looked into the
first. ‘ Milk ! ’ ’e
sez, with a shiver.
“ ’E looked into the second.
“ ‘ What’s this ’ere ? ’ he asked the housekeeper.
“ ‘ Water,’ she sed.
‘‘ ‘ Water ! ’ shouted Jerry. ‘ What d’yer mean ?
Water ! D’yer think I wanter wash meself at the
tea table ? ’
“ I’d ’ave never thought me mate could be so
dignified.
“ ’E told me privit'ly that ’e ’ad to lj,ve up to ’is
position.
» * * *
“ Next day was a snorter. ’Bout 112 in the
shade an’ write yer own ticket in the sun. We
drunk tea fer breakfast an’ tea fer lunch, but,
when the evenin’ meal come round, Jerry asked
the ’ousekeeper ’adn’t she anything else fer us to
drink.
“ ‘The well-water’s lovely an’ cool,' she sed.
What Jerry sed wuz a shock to the ole gal’s
system.
“ We set down then an’ begun to eat in silence.
Presently me mate pricked up 'is ears.
“ ‘ Ssh !’ ’e hissed, holdin’ up ’is hand. ‘ Stop
yer noise.’
“ ‘ I ain’t never sed a word,’ sed I.
“‘Well, stop yer chewin’ while I listen,’ ’e
answers.
“ From the kitchen we ’eard musik —the musik
of a corkscrew in a cork. Then a slow, lazy
gurgle o’ licker that we knew so well.
“ ‘ Beer ! ’ whispered Jerry, sniffin’ excitedly.
“‘Beer!’ he hissed again, gripping my arm.
’E strode to the door an’ flung it open.
“ ‘ What’s the meanin’ o’ this ? ’ ’e shouted.
“ The ’ousekeeper stopped with a frothy mug
o’ beer (like I jist finished this moment) ’arf way
to ’er face.
‘ ‘ ‘ Why, yer poor dear uncle never ’ad any
objeckhsun to my ’avin’ a taste now an' agen. ’E
knew I could be trusted,’ she observed. ‘ Yer
’ealth,’she said to Jerry, an’ puttin’ the glass to
’er face, tossed it off in one long, gurglin’ gulp.
“If I ’ad a pint now I’d show yer jist : ow she
done it.”
After a few moments Mr. Barnes put down an
empty mug and took up his narrative.
“ Poor Jerry staggered back to the table white
to the lips.
“ ‘ This is the limit,’ he muttered, dashin’ the
sweat from ’is brow.
“ Then ’e rushed out an’ rousted on to the farm-
’and for lettin’ the ducks ’ave so much water to
drink, with a drought threatenin’. An’ ’e give
the ole sow two settings of eggs from under the
’ousekeeper’s favorite fowls.
“ The next few days were all ’otter than each
other, an’ we lay round with our tongues out,
thinkin’ out schemes to break the beer-famine.
Jerry ’ad a great idea for hiding a cask in the roof,
with a pipe from it tb ’is bed. Another wild
scheme of his wuz to pump the well dry an’ fill it
with beer. He next proposed to dig a tunnel
from the bedroom, cornin’ out under the pub at
Williyup—a matter o’ fifteen mile.
“ Finally we bribed one of the neighbor’s kids
to bring us out some beer from Williyup, an’ hide
it in an ’aystack. ’Owever, when the blamed kid
got to the pub they wouldn’t serve ’im —’im bein’
under age.
“Then/got an idea. An’when Jim Barnes
gets an idea, it’s an idea what ’as meat on it.
“ One mornin’, early, I takes the spring-cart,
an’, with three quid that Jerry ’anded out with re-
luctince, I drives to Billiwurrah, about 20 mile
off. My idea was to get a case or two o’ beer, an’
drive back an’ plant ’em about ten mile from
’ome. Then o’ nights we’d ride out an’ let our-
selves loose on it.
“Well, I hit Billiwurrah arter a hot, thirsty
drive, an’ put up at the Shearers’ Star.
“ Naturally, the first thing I did wuz to ’ave a
pint or two wi’ the flies. Then I gits chatty with
some of the boys, an’ w'e ’ad a drink or so all
round. Then the landlord shouted, an’ one thing
led to another till the end of it wuz I wakes up
next day with a terrible head on me, an’ not the
price of a boot-lace in me kick. Arter a terrible
lot of arguing an’ persuadin’, the landlord lets me
’ave a dozen bottles on tick, an’ off I starts wfith
’em for home an’ Jerry.
“Well, it wuz a terrible hot day—hottest I
ever remember. There wuz me, drivin’ along
under a broilin’ sun, with a dynamite thirst, an’
twelve beautiful bottles in the cart.
‘ ‘ It w'as agen human nature !
“ I, stopped an’ had jist one.
‘ ‘ Then I druv on fer about an hour.
“ I begun to feel dreadful.
‘ ‘ I feared I wuz gettin’ sunstruck.
“ I reckoned I might go off in a swoon an’
Jerry’s ’orse an’ trap get itself -stolen. So I ’ad
another bottle.
‘ ‘ ’Bout a mile further along I come over bad
agen. I dosed meself with two more.
‘ ‘ Then the flamin’ sun muster got me beat, for
all I can remember is Jerry wakin’ me up outer
the bottom of the trap an’ demandin’ to know
where w'uz the beer.
“S’welp me ! There weren’t the shadow of a
bottle in the caboose. They muster been jolted
or stolen outer the cart.
“ P’raps the ’orse took ’em.
"AWAKE!!! ARISE!!!"
“Jerry took on somethin’ fearful. ’E called
me all the names : e could think on or invent, an’
Jerry 'ad a turn o’ language when ’e got goin’.
Ow’ever, 1 wuz too sunstruck to do anything
more’n swoon off agen. All I remember is seein’
a couple o’ Jerrys climbin’ on to the seat an’
turnin’ a two-’eaded ’orse furiously in the direc-
tion of Billiwurrah. . . .
“ We stayed at the Shearers’ Star for a week.
We afterwards learned that we hadn’t been theie
two days before Mrs. Wright carefully took over
the property. On the third day she telegraphed
to the landlord to send back her horse an’ spring
cart. We ’ad drank most ef the horse by that
time. There w'as a row of some kind, but I
partly disremember the particulars, the sunstroke
havin’ got worse.”
ALF BRASCH.


A Sea Murmur.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
MARGARET was always a perfect fool with
men. Any old sort in trousers was good
enough for her to flirt with, and this even
after she had married John.
The crisis came when a certain person (I will
call him The Guest, for short) stayed in the house
three or four days, and philandered fit to make
you sick. Then came Mrs. Smith’s water picnic.
Margaret told me all about it herself when the
first awfulness was past. It was a fear-
fully hot day. Everybody went to sleep in
corners, only the flies wouldn’t let them, and
when the time came to go home they all scurried
to the boats with indecent readiness. Margaret
and The Guest settled themselves in the stern of
a small boat and left the others to do the scuffling ;
so when everyone was sorted out they found John
had been left to row them home.
John tremendously strong, and the distance
was nothing to him ; but Margaret says he looked
shockingly sulky—red as a beetroot with heat and
rage, and he smacked the oars into the water till
-you could almost hear them say “ Damn ! ”
She and The Guest snuggled themselves to-
gether in that stern seat in a way that, she says,
now fills her with contrition —though I don’t
believe myself she holds much of that sort of
thing, and anyhow it doesn’t keep long. The
Guest was one of those horrid, eye-glassish,
stomachy little men that wear suede gloves and
go to afternoon-teas, and how she could —but
there, as somebody says, “ Character is Fate.”
He talked about his subliminal consciousness and
affinities, and about the moon, and how his thoughts
were too deep for tears, and all sorts of rubbish,
and she listened, I know, with her big eyes on
him, and her mouth open as if she was mesmer-
ised. They simply never looked at John, who
got redder and redder —inhumanly red, as you
might say. By-and-bye they came to the jetty,
and there John swirled the boat alongside, twirled
the oars up as if they’d been Indian clubs, and
with one raging stride plunged ashore, oars and
all. Before they realised he was gone, they saw
him marching up the road, an oar over each
shoulder, never once looking back.
Now it so happens there is a narrow and well-
marked current running by, just off the jetty, to
the farthest point of the bay, and John’s tempest-
uous departure had sent the boat adrift far enough
to be caught by it. Margaret says that as soon as
they were flowing gently along in it, The Guest
began settling his eyeglass and screwing round his
head like a perturbed owl.
“Hallo! hallo!” said he. “Why, your
good husband has gone, and taken the oars with
him ! ”
They sat looking at each other for quite a while,
and Margaret says she already began to see she’d
been mistaken in him, and to wish for John.
“We seem to be drifting,” said The Guest,
wagging his nose hither and thither ; “are there
any currents about here ? ”
AFTER THE WEDDING.
REV. MEEKER : “ There is — ah, hem — the—eh
little mattah of my fee."
BRIDEGROOM: here , mister, you will
have it marriages is made in Heaven. Well,
I'll pay fer this one when I get there."
Margaret gave jump and a gasp, and began to
cry.
“ Of course, there are—is, I mean,” she said—-
“ and we’re in it. Oh, take me out of it, take
me out of it, I tell you. Over there, round the
point, is where all the people that get drowned
bathing are swept by this current — this current, I
tell you, this very current we're in. Oh, take me
out of it directly.”
Then The Guest showed himself in his true
colors, which were black as ink.
“My good creature,” he said, goggling crossly
at her with his glassiest eye, “be so kind as to
keep quiet and let me think what is to be done.”
]\ I argaret is fright-
fully tearful by
nature, so she only
wept the more.
Then he got an-
grier and angrier,
and snapped at
her like a turtle :
“ Stop it, confound
you!” But it takes
more than that
even to stop Mar-
garet in a good
solid howl. Then
he got up and
moved to the bow
of the boat, and
knelt there, poking
his head in and out
like a cormorant,
and muttering to
himself, till it
struck Margaret
all in a moment
that the horror of
the situation was
too much for him,
and he was going
out of his mind.
By this time they
were a good way
on towards the
point, and it was
beginning to get
dark. Suddenly
he turned, Mar-
garet says, a fright-
fully wild look
upon her, and ex-
claimed : “ Take
off your dress ! ”
Then she knew
he was mad. She
simply sat and
stared in terror.
He came clamber-
ing back towards
her with his silly
patent - leather
shoes slipping and
sliding about so
that he barked his shin over the thwart, which
didn’t seem to calm him at all. Margaret says
his appearance was maniacal. She was dumb
with horror. But he only sat down in front of
her and repeated, much louder :
“Take off your dress,” and, after a pause,
“ Idiot !”
With trembling fingers sbe began on her hooks
and things, but, what with being so frightened
and rather plump and short in the arms, she soon
got stuck among the back buttons. Then she
cried some more, till he almost leaped at her,
roaring :
“ What the Devil is the matter now ?”
“ My bub-bub-buttons,” she sobbed.
“ Show me your bub-bub-blasted buttons,” he
shouted, so she had to turn round and point,
never knowing
but what a
paroxysm might
seize him at any
moment, and
he might slay
her from be-
hind. Between
them they got
her dress off,
and her hat, and
her shoes, and
then he said.
“Now your
petticoats.”
At this Mar-
garet wailed.
“ Oh I can’t,
I can’t." But
he took her by
the shoulders,
and shook her
till her teeth
chattered in her
head.
“Don’t you
understand, you
Egregious Nin-
compoop,” he
bellowed (“just
as if I was stone
deaf,” says Mar-
garet), “I’ve
got to save you
from a watery
grave, and it
has to be done
before we get
round the point,
and how can I
tow you along
with these fol-
lies wrapping
round your
legs ? ”
Margaret says
the look in his
eye was so ap-
palling, she had
no strength to resist. Off went her petticoats,
and her only consolation was that her combina-
tions had two frills of lace threaded with pink
bebe ribbon.
By this time they were close to the point—not
more than twenty yards away, Margaret thinks.
He took her by the arm, pinching her in a mad
sort of way, she says, and made her sit on the
edge of the boat with her feet in the water. Then
he tipped her off with frightful suddenness, and
when she rose, gasping, to the surface, he told
her to hold on to the gunwale till he was ready.
Margaret says she had swallowed too much salt
water to upbraid him. Then he flopped over
beside her, and told her to let go of the boat.
Naturally she refused, and who could blame her
with a maniac gibbering beside her ? This
seemed to enrage him more than all that had
gone before, and he shrieked, “ Let go, I say !”
into her ear with such fearful energy that she did
it automatically. At the same instant, says
Margaret, he gripped her by the hair, and thrust
her forcibly beneath the waves, and she gave her-
AT HEAVEN'S GATE.
SPOOK OF SERVANT GIRL : “ Please, sir, can
I come in? I've slot the [?]ighest references
from me previous place! ”
self up for lost. She could find nothing to clutch,
she could only kick and gurgle, and just as she
was sinking, she thinks, for the last time, her toe
touched solid ground. With the vigor of despair,
she dragged herself from his grasp, and, support-
ing herself with one hand upon his stomach (this
seemed to annoy him absurdly), she plunged to
shore with her last breath.
Well, I leave you to imagine what they looked
like (skin-tights were not to be named beside it),
and a mile and a half from home, though, happily,
by a lonely road and nearly dark. That mile and
a half, Margaret says, was a nightmare. They
squabbled the whole way as to whose fault it was,
till she fell over a stone by the wayside and cut
her knee and nearly broke her toe. That finished
her. She refused to rise, and, when he asked her
if she meant to spend the night there, she burst
forth. “Oh, John, John ! ” she wailed. “If only
I’d been with John instead of you, you little, fat,
ugly, stupid thing, you ! He’d never have let me
wet my shoes even, instead of cutting my knee,
and breaking my toe, and drowning me, and
losing my worked muslin and my best hat, and,
oh, my petticoats 1 ”
She cast herself on the grass at the edge of the
road, and simply roared, and when at last she
looked up, The Guest was gone. So she limped
to the gate (feeling better after a good cry), and
up the drive, and peeped in at the drawing-room
window. There sat John ready dressed for
dinner, pretty cross still by the look of him, and
pulling out his watch every five seconds. She
slipped behind the curtain and called :
“John ! ”
“Hullo!’’said he, looking round. “Where
are you ? ”
She put her head out of the curtain and said
weakly :
“ Here ! ”
“Been in the water?” said John, still very
stony. “Where’s The Guest?” only he called
him something quite different.
“ / don't know,” said Margaret. “ Oh, John,
I’ve been nearly drowned.” And with that she
burst into tears and came out of her curtain to
weep on his bosom. He gave one tremendous
snort of laughter at sight of her, then tried to look
stonier than ever, and said :
“ Mind my shirt.”
At that point, Margaret says, she made a
supreme effort.
“ Look ! ” she said, and pointed to where real,
true, bleeding blood was running down her poor
leg.
“ You poor little goose,” said John, and with
no more words gathered her up and took her
straight off to bed.
We suppose The Guest went to a hotel for the
night. At any rate he sent for his things early
next morning, and that was the last we ever saw
of him, except that once I met with his name on
a thin little green book of poems with rough edges
to the paper called “ Sea Murmurs.”
A. WHISHAW.
A Song of General Sick-and-
Tiredness.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I’M tired of raving at wrong things which must
still to the end endure ;
I’m sick and tired of the selfish rich, and I’m
tired of the selfish poor.
Of the Awful Wrongs of the Social plan (both
sides, and in between) —
I’m tired of The Bulletin’s own Fat Man, and
I’m also tired of the Lean.
’Tis a weariness born of these twenty years of
’rastlin’ with Truth and Lies,
And of writing on rum and in blood-stained tears,
that the, People might Wake and Rise !
I am wild, Damned Wild, at the wages paid for
fighting with Freedom’s Foes,
And the awful blunders the people made when at
last they Woke and Rose.
The motor car is the Car of Greed, and I’ve often
written it down
(With little effect I fear, indeed, for I notice it
still in town) ;
But now I'm tired of the Goggled Hog, and his
veiled contemptuous “dart.”
I am also weary of Boko Bill and his fruit and
Bottle-0 cart.
I’m weary of Clara Vere de Vere, and her Bloque
at the grand hotel,
And the Orphan Girl and the Orphan Boy —and
their mother and father as well.
It is not their fault, for extremes are fate (and
extremes will meet again)—
I’m also disgusted with One-Eyed Kate and her
bloke in Red Rock Lane.
My soul is sad for the young bards here who rave
of a wrong red-hot,
And care not a curse, so they get their beer, if the
people starve or not.
With a fine contempt for the grave and the tomb,
and the old books on the shelves,
They gibe and sneer at the old bard’s gloom— and
they straightway weep themselves.
I’m tired of the cruel, bleeding welt on the Young
Heart Tempest-Tost ;
Likewise of the love that we never felt, and the
friend that we never lost.
I’m tired of the long white limbs, small head, and
eyes of unearthly hue ;
Of the Bride, Rose Red, in her Bridal Bed—and
I’m sick of the Other Man, too.
I’m tired—O I’m tired —of the bleeding heart of
the bride that never was wed ;
And the Dagger Drave—and the blood-stained
grave of the lover who never was dead.
Of the wronged young wife, and her blighted life.
Also of the locket worn
With the Golden Curl from the Head of the Girl
or the Babe that never was born.
To resume:
I’m scared of the great strong arms and the
breast, and the brute force under control;
Of the gloomy eyes, and the head, and the rest —
and the hidden heart and soul —
Of the muscle and tan of the awful MAN that
our girl bards rave about ;
The first of his kind since the world began—and
I want them to trot him out.
Of the Swooning Love, ’neath the stars (above),
and the Slumbrous Burning Eyes ;
Of the Blarst of Skorn from our Bards of Morn,
and our girl-bards’ DAMN, likewise.
(And let it be said, ere we go to bed, lest you
curse me needlessly;
That I do not moan for these things alone, for
I’m also tired of ME).
To proceed:
I’m sick of the sight of the Single White in the
islands far away,
Who is jabbed with a poisoned spear by night,
and who pots the tribe next day.
A club-man dead to the world he knew, and long
by his love forgot—
And the innocent swims with the Lithe Brown
Limbs, and—the rest of the Thomas Rot.
He’s mostly a thin brown man in twill and specs
(for his sight is dim),
And a score of niggers to work his will, and Ah
Soon to cook for him.
With the steamer in sight (and a drunken white)
and'the rest of the world within hail,
A wife —or the pick of the native girls—and his
fairly reg’lar mail.
And now to conclude :
I’m tired of the sneering at friendship, too, for
you’ll find in the end, no doubt,
When you get run in, and the world looks blue,
there’ll be one to bail you out —
I’m tired of the Love of the Bygone Day, of
Women and Dice and Wine —
You’ll find, when his Washup has said his say,
’tis the Missus that pays the fine.
You may Shriek to High Heaven of love and
death, and howl of a Soul in Pain,
You may Curse the Gods with your latest breath
till the cows come home again ;
But Dad plods home from his work to-night—in
his bosom a peace profound —
To his bustling wife and kitchen bright, and
he helps thfe world go round.
You may write of revolvers. and nerves of steel,
and the eyes of a steel-blue grey,
Of the white man banned, with his life in his
hand, in those Islands far away ;
Of his panther limbs and his courage grand, and
his deadly aim and true —
But Bill and Jim with perception dim would call
him a Jackeroo.
You may rave and rave of your fancy loves that
go by your fancy names,
But the bread you eat and the bills you meet are
fixed by Lizzie and James.
You may ode your Gladyses and what not at the
rest let your scorn be hurled,
But Lucy, and Mary, and Jack, and Fred—O !
they are the living world.

THE BALLAD OF
JUDGMENT
DAY
(FOR THE BULLETIN)
THE Criminal came to the Throne of God
At the close of the Judgment Day ;
And with a truculent step he trod :
He had come to have his say.
And he held his head —it was sideways set,
And the bruise of the noose was on it yet —
Upright, in an awkward way.
The serried hosts his curt glance swept ;
Before his eyes theirs fell.
And jauntily up to the Throne he stepped ;
’Twas a scene he knew so well !
To the Judge he nodded —he had no awe,
For he was familiar with courts of law,
And had often been sent to Plell !
The Judge began to drone the Law ;
But he, with a wry grimace,
Uplifted a hand that looked a claw,
And thrust up his narrow face.
And over the startled form of One
A horrible shudder seemed to run—
A shudder that trailed through Space.
The hosts of Paradise, swept with fears,
Their spheral music stayed
A moment —or a thousand years—
While fleering, unafraid,
Before the Plotter stood His Plan—
The Master Workman and His Man —-
This grim tool he had made.
“ Because their laws I went and broke,
They hanged me high,” said he.
“ They got quits with me for my little joke ;
But I’m jiggered if I can see
If’twas Jester or Devil that dared to make
These laws, and then —His laws to break —
Deliberately made Me ? ”
The felon straightened his sideways head
(The Judge quailed from his frown) :
“ Take off that motley robe,” he said ;
“Take off that noose-like crown !
By your works you shall he judged, you know ;
And / am a beautiful work to show !
From your pantomime throne —step down ! ”
And at his scorn the serried hosts
That sat round, ring on ring,
Dissolved and dwindled into ghosts ;
While He, their discrowned King,
Stepped cringing from his futile Throne,
And stood, in all cold Space alone,
A shivering, naked thing.
And over the ruins of Paradise
And over the endless dead
The Convict with his little eyes
Slouched with his leg-iron tread.
And on the cracked old Throne he sat,
With a halo like a tilted hat
Upon his sideways head.
“You might have made a thing of pride,”
He spoke, “ for you were shod
With majesty and puissance wide.
You didn’t—though you were God !
And all your high, tremendous powers,
And all your length of endless hours
Made ME —this pretty clod !
“ All that you dreamed of, budded, hoped
Through all Eternity,
And all that you fumbled for and groped,
Summed in this face you see.
So high on Time’s sumptuous banquet wall
I set my mark in my jail-bird scrawl—
This MENE TEKEL—Me !
“ So by this narrow, slanted brow,
This sullen, bestial jaw—
It was murderer’s work —I doom you now !
This makeshift botch, this flaw
You wilfully out of Nothing brought ;
So at your throat —’tis a trick you taught !
My hand that is a claw ! ”
Then he summoned before his Judgment Seat
The Powers that had done
This thing, and spawned their incomplete
And maimed and twisted son.
And sitting stiff on that Throne of Dread,
With his crooked eyes and his crooked head,
He doomed them, one by one.
First, Evolution, with its wiles,
Its endless, pitiless strife ;
Then Love that maimed with subtle smiles,
And Hatred, with its knife ;
And Priests and Conquerors, and Trade,
And all the gods that Man had made,
And, lastly, he doomed Life.
And so at last he was left alone,
This King of claw and fang,
A sideways thing on a tottering throne;
There were no more to hang.
And, from that desolated place
At the end of Time, far out through Space
His bitter laughter rang.
The crumbling walls of Space were rent,
The stars rained in a rout ;
And, shattering, through each atom went
A cataclysmic Doubt ;
And like a sickening candle light,
Into its old, primeval Night
The Universe guttered out.

ARTHUR H. ADAMS.
A Yellow Terror.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
IT was all Alec’s fault. If he hadn’t started
being rude, we’d have all got home quietly.
You see, we’d been having a send-off, or a
welcome-home or something, to someone who’d
been somewhere or was going somewhere, and we
were all going home quietly in the last train.
There were myself, George, Jack, Alec, Mick and
me—just the seven of us.
We’d had one or two drinks, or perhaps more,
but were quite all right—quiet, well-behaved and
gentlemanly.
George was crying himself to sleep in the corner
because a policeman had spoken unkindly to him.
(George was always terribly sensitive.) Alec was
very bad-tempered because we had not let him
hit the policeman who was rude to George.
Mick had hold of him, because every few minutes
he’d hear George’s sobs and would want to get
out and go back and look for the bobby. (Alec
always was so sympathetic.)
Jack was eating crayfish all over the compart-
ment and throwing the shells through the open
window of the next carriage, which annoyed the
inmates thereof. But it amused Jack wonderfully.
He wasted a lot of good crayfish doing it. Mean-
time, I was tossing myself for pennies, and we
were all happy.
Suddenly Alec turned to Mick, looked at him
fixedly for some time, and said : “ D’y’u know
you’re too good-looking for a man !”
Mick giggled vainly. He prided himself on his
appearance, did Mick.
“ Should have been a girl, I suppose,” he said,
“ No, a pig,” answered Alec.
Then the trouble began. Mick wanted a bit of
Alec as a keepsake, and a big bit for preference.
He proceeded to procure samples.
We disentangled them after a while and quieted
them down somewhat.
Mick recovered his serenity and remarked that
he had spent his whole week’s screw in Tattersall’s.
Thereupon Alec, who was looking for trouble,
asked him who owned t’other half of the ss.
ticket. That incensed Mick, and started things
off again.
George woke up with a start from some wild
dream, and with a yell of “ Play on the wing,”
delivered a mighty kick which found a destination
in the region of Jack’s ticket pocket. That in-
censed gentleman retaliated by smiting his
antagonist over the head with the corpse of the
crayfish. Meanwhile I was in a terrible difficulty.
At the outset of the disagreement, the penny, with
which I was tossing myself, was knocked out of
my left hand (whose toss it was), and rolled on
the floor under the seat. I didn’t want to lose
that penny, so I crawled after it. Immediately
they all began to walk over me and stamp on me.
My only defence was to bite. I did bite, and
there was merrvell.
I dread to think what would have happened
had not a diversion taken place at Albert Park.
The train was just leaving the station when the
door was flung open and a Chinaman jumped in.
Just an ordinary Chinaman of the Chow sort it
was. But it was oil on troubled waters. It set
itself coyly in a corner. We all sat down and
looked at it.
“ It’s mine ! I saw it first,” hissed George,
who was himself again.
He removed his coat, folded it methodically
and rolled up his sleeves.
“ At two meetings this very week I’ve backed
seven seconds,” he muttered, darkly. “It’s
time I killed a Chinaman.”
He reached for the Mongol. It gave a scream
of terror and dived under the seat. George went
down on hands and knees and followed it. The ter-
rified Asiatic broke cover, tried to escape through
the spittoon, failed, leapt for the luggage rack,
and entrenched itself there, sobbing “ Whaffor?”
The rest of us got up on the opposite rack, so
as to give George and it plenty of scope.
George sprang at the heathen’s boot, and got it
—on the jaw. He subsided on to the seat, and
remained there in a heap, while Mick, watch in
hand, counted eight seconds. George rose to it
again. Four times he made the assault, and four
times he was beaten back. Talk about Port
Arthur ! Not a circumstance ! George grew
cautious. He feinted at the feet, then grabbed at
the yellow head. He secured the unrolled
pigtail, and by it tried to scale the heights
hand over hand. He was almost up—excite-
ment tense —the besieged screaming for quarter —
victory within grasp —when the rack broke.
Down went rack and Chow on top of the brave,
but unfortunate, George.
AFTER LIFE'S FITFUL SLEEVER.
It may have been our shout of fierce joy. May-
be we unduly wriggled. Anyhow a moment
later our rack gave way also, and down, down we
plunged into the arena. ,
A terrible few minutes followed. There was
Chinaman all over the compartment, biting,
clawing, kicking, cursing. I feel shame even now
as I write. It was a 10-h.p. Chow. It had us
anyhow. It got all over us. It bit and
scratched and kicked from-all points of the com-
pass. Its play in the ruck would have beaten
Carlton. There is no telling what would have
Deen the end had it not got its teeth (its terrible
teeth) entangled in the netting of the rack. That
acted as a muzzle.
We were saved—at least the unbitten parts of
us were. They were inconsiderable.
As George said : “The only place where he
didn’t bite me was on the lung.”
Of course we gave it in charge when we arrived
at St. Kilda, as a dangerous lunatic that had
run amuck. Some of us wanted to let the matter
drop, but, as George pointed out, we had our
duty to the community to do as peaceable citi*
zens ;so we did it. We made it as light as
possible for it by recommending it to mercy. But
the policeman who took charge of what was left
of it said he had been keeping his eye on it, or
something just like it, for a long time. So I
think it will go hard with it. Serve it right.
Things of that sort are a menace to society.
Suppose we had been defenceless women instead
of strong, steady men who could protect them-
selves ? Anything might have happened.

Why I Was Late.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
AFTER supper, which had consisted mainly
of lobster, we had a Benedictine. Where-
upon Valentine —he is a student oi law—
advanced the opinion that Chartreuse is better
than Benedictine. We tried Chartreuse. Then
it occurred to us that we had never tasted creme
de menthe. So we had creme de menthA
Then we decided to go down the whole list of
liqueurs. We were pleased with the result. We
repeated the process, with even more gratifying
results. Of what next happened we have not a
very distinct recollection, but we eventually found
ourselves on the pavement. We have a distinct
recollection of finding ourselves on the pavement.
We hailed a cab. Seventeen cabs drove up. We
each got into a different cab, but all found our-
selves inside the same cab. We drove off, each
singing his own favorite song with a loud voice.
We all had loud voices. When we got out of the
cab it was dawn. Bertie—he’s a press photographer
—took our photographs. There were five of us, but
when the plate was developed it showed fifteen of
us.
We went to sleep and dreamed dreams.
I dreamed that my stretcher was situated on the
tramway track, at the corner of King and George
streets. I had to keep getting out of bed to shift the
stretcher out of the way of trams. In the grey hours
of the morning people began to come about—quite
a lot of people—and I wanted to get up. But I
couldn’t. My trousers were on the Quay. What
could Ido ? The people passing to and fro stared
at me with vacant eyes. I was ashamed of
myself, and hid my head under the bedclothes.
Presently a herd of mastodon came wandering
down George-street, browsing on lamp posts.
One of them, a particularly ugly, fierce-looking
brute, rubbed himself against a shop and it fell
down. I grew frightened. They would soon
reach me. They might browse on vie. However,
they turned off towards Pitt-street, and nobody
took any notice of them. How I longed for my
trousers ! Once I was on the point of calling to a
passing policeman, but on second thoughts de-
cided that I wouldn’t, as to attract his atten-
tion might cause trouble. I let him pass,
That was unfortunate, because the next moment
I was confronted by a horrible, prehistoric
Thing, with a dragon-like body, a snake-like
neck, and bulging green eyes. It smelt under
my bed. It sniffed at me, undecided whether
or not to eat me. Suddenly, with a gurgle of
delight, it opened its cavernous jaws to swallow
me. What should Ido ? I would shriek, I
A million firebells rang out. Steam whistles
blew. It was pandemonium. It was Gehenna.
It was Mafeking Day. It was a football match,
It was the General Resurrection. It was the
downfall of civilisation, or an Italian calling out
ice-cream or something. I woke with a start,
T he breakfast gong was sounding,
That is why I was late at the office,

Grey Gulls.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THE swamp-hen seeks the rushes
When storm-flags flaunt on high—
When sunset flares and flushes
The heavy-lidded sky,
The wild thrush finds a shelter,
The wood-hen has her nest,
But out in wet and welter
The Grey Gulls know no rest.
Oh ! Grey Gulls following the plough and the
harrow,
Hczv shall you fend the tempest through, Grey
Gulls ?
God’s angels care for the falling of a sparrow.
Stirely he watches over you, Grey Gulls ?
Said the Grey Gulls: '■'■Listen to the brealcrs ’
ceaseless thunder.”
The pigeons frail are homing—
They’re home-birds, one and all ;
The Grey Gulls in the gloaming
Send out their harsh sea-call,
As forth and back a-sweeping
They search the sodden fields
For aught a-crawl or creeping—
For what the winter yields.
Oh ! Grey Gulls calling in the litter wind that’s
blowing,
How are ye faring in the storm, Grey Gtills ?
Would I might bring you where the ruddy fires
are glowing —
Here where the house-birds nestle warm, Grey
Gulls.
Said the Grey Gulls: “Listen! hew the cliffs
are torn asunder l ”
Far out where wild seas bellow
Is one who comes to me—
A brawny, handsome fellow—
And such a night at sea !
The salt crests lift and scatter,
All hissing in the dark.
Ah ! naught on earth would matter
If he lay stiff and stark.
Oh! Grey Gtills wailing, seek ye rest until to-
morrow,
Weary and hungered, though you be, Grey Gulls!
Would L could tell if ’twill bring me joy or sorrow I
What is the message of the sea, Grey Gulls ?
Said the Grey Gulls, “Listen and you ll hear the
breakers rolling ! ”
The pigeons, since their homing,
Are settled snug and warm.
The Grey Gulls in the gloaming
Are crying at the storm
That drives them from their ledges
And craggy hollows bare
To seek, by inland hedges,
A bitter, frugal fare.
Oh ! Grey Gulls wailing in the cruel blast that's
blowing,
Harsh are the darkling thoughts you bring, Grey
Gulls.
Would he were here, where the ruddy fires are
glowing !
Would he were here, my sailor-king, Grey Gulls !
Said the Grey Gulls, “ Listen, and you'll hear the
bells a-tolling ! ”

Soup and Flounders.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THE restaurant that I frequent is situated
near the legal quarter of the city, and while
I gnaw my roast beef, people who are
lunching on their way to and from the courts
wrangle in whispers about wills, deeds, and
settlements, and scatter fragments of tragedy all
over the place.
The other day a couple whose divorce case, I
fancy, must have been coming on that afternoon,
sat down to have (possibly) their last earthly
meal together. They sat at the next table to me.
The lady was forty, large, florid, and angry. The
gentleman was forty-five, fat, florid, and furious.
Evidently he didn’t want her to lunch. Evi-
dently, also, she had something to say to him.
The woman led off as the waiter fled for the
soup. She said “ Beast ! ”
The man said “ Bah ! woman ! bah !”
“ You wretch ! ” in a quivering undertone.
“ Hold your tongue ! ”
“ You coward ! Do you call yourself a man ? ”
• “Bah ! ”
“To think that I put up with you for fifteen
years ! Oh, you brute ! ”
“ Bah ! ”
‘ ‘ What have you got to say for yourself ? ”
“Bah!”
“ Don’t you dare to talk to me ! ”
“ Well, shut up ! ”
“ You brute ! ”
“Bah !”
“ What did you say to that woman about me?”
“ What woman ? ”
“ You know very well.”
“ I don't know.”
“ You do know. ”
“ I tell you I don't."'
“ Oh, you liar ! ”
“Bah!”
{lnterval.)
“ I’ve been a good wife to you.”
“ That'll do !”
“You can’t deny it!” Then, as an after-
thought—“ You brute ! ”
“ 7'hat ’ll do, I tell you.”
“ Many and many ’.r the time ”
“That’ll do !”
“ I said many and many’s the time ”
“ Yes, I know you did. You always say things
twice.”
“Well, it’s the truth.”
“Bosh !”
“ How dare you ! ”
“ Bah l"
Here the waiter rushed in, planked the soup on
the table, and scuttled downstairs out of the way.
Then the lady said, in a choking voice, “ If
you’re a man you’ll pass me the salt.”
He passed the salt.

The man looked up from the dregs of his soup,
and remarked, “ So you’ve got your long-distance

“ Loved me ! ... Bah !"
1 ‘ That’s exactly how I feel! ”
The lady leant over the table and said, very
distinctly, “You brute!"
The gentleman leant over the table until his
nose touched the rim of her picture hat.
“ Shut up !” he snarled. “ Shut up!"
“You wretch ! ”
“ Shut up ! ”

snatched his hat from the rack. Then he slammed
it on his head and flicked his fingers at the
waiter.

towards the stairs. *

flounders and made an appropriate remark in
pure Greek.

nearer, whether walking, flying, swimming, or
wading like Satan, was uncertain, but coming,
getting larger, the one bit of movement in the
silent phantasmagoria that made the deadly still-
ness of everything else still stiller.
Ages seemed to pass as his perspective increased
(or decreased) and ere he became tangible just a
few yards off.
He held in his hand an axe, and with it pro-
ceeded to notch the post at a point about on a
level with his own shoulders.
He was not slow in his movements, but as he
worked I seemed to muse on the miracle for a
couple of thousand years and then get tired.
“ What does it all mean ? ” I said at last.
My voice seemed to go out in frozen chunks
and fall to the ground at my feet. But he must
have heard, for he turned his head seemingly sur-
prised and somewhat amused at my presence.
But he went on with his notching without a word,
and almost another couple of thousand years
seemed to go by.
When I got tired of the suspense, I cried
anew : “ What meaneth this, sirrah ? ” The
“ sirrah ” must have done it. Pfe blandly turned
again.
“What means it? Why time commences—
that’s what ! Oblivion ends ! Worlds are to be
evolved ! Gorgons created ! Aions to pass ! In
a billion years History will commence ! That’s
what ! ”
And, having completed the first notch of Time,
he made off as he came, and I was left'looking at it.
* * •* *
So Time was to commence, was it ? I went
through in contemplation the whole philosophy of
the portended pre-Adamitic evolution. There
was comfort in it. Oblivion was at an end, and
company and companionship were promised.
In time the Paleozoic, the Mesozoic, and Caino-
zoic, with its Cretaceous, Eocene, Miocene, Plio-
cene and the rest would all be run through, and
Man himself evolved, and then that curious broth
of progressive evolution called History would
commence !
It was big ! Clearly, what things would I not
see if I continued sitting there. There would
be little change at first for an aeon of two.
They were probably aeons that he had com-
menced to notch off on the post. In two
hundred billions ages I might have the pleasure
of seeing him come again and make another notch.
I wondered if he would remember me. It
began to get chilly.
Suddenly I saw him turn back, as an after-
thought seemingly, and come towardshne again.
“Beg pardon !” he said, “but it never struck
me before—perhaps you’ll be feeling a bit lonely,
and all that. Would you care to come back with
me ? ”
I cared, and as we went along he said, “ Pot
luck, you know ! ”
IT was not dark all round me, nor was it light.
A steely color, perhaps, rather than anything
else.
A thin belt, almost light enough to suggest
dawn, stretched around the middle of it where
might be the horizon, if horizon there was in such
indescribable form or formlessness of landscape,
such flat nothingness “of neither sea nor shore,
nor air, nor fire.”
In the midst of it all, just in front of me, stood,
strange but palpable enough, a white painted
post, upright in the ground—if it was ground.
Suddenly a form appeared, making its way

The Ochre Mines of San Dolo.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
SAN DOLO is in the west of the flyspeck
island of San Pietro, a few miles south of
Portovesme, the most southerly port of
Sardinia. The capital and only town of San
Pietro is Carloforte, where in the festivals of
August the devout rank themselves at the sea
edge and in the sea, and sing a gloria. It is a
Christian gloria now —but it was originally an act
of Pagan worship ; a song to placate Neptune.
In the church that night there was a cheap tin-
toned organ playing, and a dirty young priest with
an angel’s voice singing something more like a
war-song than a chant. Thin, worn women and
pale, work-dried men sought sanctuary from the
reverberant streets, and knelt in little groups on
the flags of tufa ; high above was the dim figure ot
Christ in His agony. A young and pretty
woman, her left side, arm and hand paralysed,
entered the church, walking sideways, her wooden
zoccolo clicking on the flags, and I went out to
bow the knee to the perfect night.
At seven o’clock next morning the little cobbled
square was beginning to sw'irn in heat haze. I ran
away from the stinking town and bought two
rock melons, and hired a boat and went into the
clean sea to eat them. It is but a short run from
Carloforte to Tunis, and a felucca for Africa was
putting to sea in the dead calm, w'ith one
picturesque half-naked man breasting a long
sweep in the shadow of his great sail to keep
steerage way on. It was good to get away from
the dirty shore, where the town jetsam almost
covered the Pope’s cannon —dismounted and
silted up, and half perished, by the sea.
Yet for all these loud stenches the people are
clean enough bodily. The women are daily
bathers, and if the women of a community arc
clean the men must be.
Returning to the town I found what at first
sight appeared to be a festa —one of the 365 of
the year- —being celebrated rather enthusiastically
considering the heat. I met four processions in
half an hour—at least 1 thought I had met four
processions until a more careful study of the
unhealthy-looking priest on the fourth occasion
proved to me that the procession had rushed round
the town at top speed whenever I happened to be
out of sight, and that I had met the one procession
four times. Then I recognised also the Chinese
umbrella canopy he walked under, and the twenty
wizened old women carrying big candles.
Later enquiry showed me that this was a bridal
party at rehearsal, and that afternoon when I went
to the Sardinian steamer to bid my new friend of
Montepone farewell, the bride and groom came
aboard —the mother-in-law accompanying them
to the mainland.
This use of the mother-in-law as umpire is
distinctly Sardinian. With the bridal party to the
steamer came a good-looking, self-admiring young
man, in a new frock and old trousers. He looked
majestic, until, with a flourish, he picked up his
coat-tails and puts his hands in his pockets.
Then the crowd laughed itself to exhaustion, for a
foot or so of shirt hung from the old trousers.
But the majestic man was serenely dead to it all.
Next morning the “oil engineer” aroused me
very early, and we rode off to the ochre mines.
As usual, the “ oil engineer,” who called himself
so although he was merely a canvasser for lubri-
cants, insisted on being noticed—flogging his
horse over the break-neck stones, and then
reining in and looking to me to applaud him. S
My own despairing little horse was tor- |
tured by a mediaeval bit —a cheerful con-
trivance which opeped when the rein
tightened, so that a circular file rasped
the horse’s palate and a damnable con-
trivance of balls and spikes was
forced on the root of the tongue.
There was no sense or reason in
the cruelty, and I felt better when
I had unshipped the gratuitous
fiendishness and left the little
horse’s mouth free.,
The Master of the Horse, a
ragged pirate of benevolent
aspect, trotted by my side, and
whenever the little horse
baulked upon the moving
stones, he cried “ Forward,
ugly princess of the House of
Savoy ! ” When the people
put their politics into their
jokes, they are waking up ;
when they fire their political
hatreds as a measure of abuse,
they are becoming serious.
We came to the sea by
Cape Sandalo, with
ahead the tufa and
trachyte of the island-
of the Spur of the
Cock. It is a wild and
brilliant coast ; there is a
lighthouse, of flaming ochre, on
the cape, for passing here is the
direct route to Algeria from Marseilles.
There was a very blue sky and a
washing-day-blue sea, lit by an incandescent
sun ; and on the beach and on the cliff heights were
heaps of puzzling color—dark yellow, violet and
chrome ochres ; and, in the cliff faces, flames from
the beds of red ochre and gleams from the exposed
faces of jasper. Cape Rosso jutted his front of
ochre-red over the blue waves—it was all un-
naturally brilliant, as if you were to look at a
sunny day with a red glass to one eye and a yel-
low glass to the other.
The manager brought us a quarter of a mile
inland to a tunnel mouth where there were many
dumps, and yellow-faced, yellow handed, ragged
men hand-picked the ochres clean of stone and
slate. The manager then gave to the Cagliari
engineer and to me some red, yellow, and purple
rags at the tunnel mouth, and advised us to strip
to the hoots and don the brilliant patchwork. We
did, and when squeezed into the rags so that
portions of me bulged at every hole I turned to
speak to the manager, but found instead a bowing
impresario—or shift boss —his acetylene lamp
burning noisily. He said that he had been granted
the honorable privilege of showing me through
the workings—the manager having returned to
the Cape of Redness to cook the dinner. It was a
new light on the functions of mine managers, hut
I said nothing, and we entered the tunnel —the
gallery of Saint Paul. It is Sooft. long, and cost
to drive about five shillings per running foot,
6ft. wide and 7ft. high. Miners earn is. a day
—shift bosses is. 3d. The ochres, jaspers, and
manganese occur in flat beds, capped by trachyte.
The order from surface is trachyte, yellow jasper,
violet ochre (12 inches), yellow jasper (6 inches),
dark yellow ochre (6 inches), jasper (6 inches),
yellow ochre (6 inches), manganese (15 inches),
red jasper, red ochre and yellow jasper again.
The prices of the products leave such a little
margin for the mining of spoil that there is not
one miner-like working in the concern. In places
where the manganese is too low-grade to be
mined, only the ochres are won ; so that although
there are stopes l° n g
places the heights are such that there is barely
room to swing a pick.
We crept along spaces long enough and wide
enough, but so shallow that, after crawling to the
faces where these naked, yellow, red and violet
men panted in the ochre dust —lying cramped on
their sides —suffering an exaggeration of all the
discomforts of the coal-hewer mining a small and
dirty seam, and finding diffi-
culty in swinging their small
A FAIR EXCUSE.
“ Ye tells me ye can't pay yer board , y' do.
Yet ye can buy beer en cigarettes."
“ Well, yer nags me that much I ’as to soothe
me nerves SOME [?]ow.”
picks—we had to back out again to a main
drive. As the inspection lengthened to the
newest exploratory work, the “ old odors and old
memories and airs of long ago ” began to revive
in ilie oclired rags we wore, and then we found a
shallow stope, where 20 naked men were work-
ing, and the stenches in that ochre mine became
terrible indeed.
The naked men were wasted so that they looked
like dead men, until you saw their eyes, and in
them the despairing look of strong men dying of
sudden accident. At the entrance to a permanent
crosscut, where I could walk half-upright, I looked
back upon those red and yellow men pigmented
fantastically in dabs and patches, and cramped
like monkeys, as, bent shoulder to knee, they
crawled along the little galleries.
Rack to the sea we went for lunch with some of
the yellow, red and purple-streaked men ; a boy,
violet on one cheek and yellow on the other,
carrying the samples. The self-conscious oil
engineer had been dozing in the white stone
house on the glaring cliff, but awoke as I splashed
warm water over my lurid head and shoulders ;
and, noting humorously my baldness, he mur-
mured, “ Grande duomo,” and spoiled it im-
mediately by losing his nerve and apologising
for the familiarity. This desire to please
amounted to servility, and was shared
by one other there ; but there was
no kindness for the painted boy who had carried
my samples of ochres and manganese over the hills
to the sea. The heat and his burdens had been
discounted by the tip he saw on the horizon, and
when the men tried to persuade me to give him
nothing the painted boy’s despair was terrible to
witness. The clerk who had tried to take my
boots off in the changing-house that morning ran
out to the boy and cursed him. He had been full
of hope, and now after the burden there was to be
no reward. The tears ran down his painted
cheeks, and at that I went out to him and gave
him tw'o francs ; and his sorrow changed to joy,
and he said something about the Madonna giving
me three francs fifty cents for myself one of these
days.
After lunch they tried to seduce me to a siesta,
but I changed my clothes again for the brilliant
rags of the morning and finished the work by
4 o’clock, when the mine stopped for the
day. So down we went to the well by the cliff
and stripped, and threw buckets of water at one
another, until the violet and red and yellow
patches changed to a dirty streakiness. Then a
striped and gaunt old miner pulled a handful of
a pig-weed with crystalline green berries, and
rubbed it to a pulp on his body. I imitated his
action, and very soon the streakiness was lost in
the greenish-red lather of this natural soap.
The piratical sea and the painted island became
more piratical and flamed the more when these
miners—whose real profession v'as sailoring or
fishing or tunny catching,_ or anything else that a
man may find to do wfith his hands at sea -
dressed in their clothes of the surface ; which
were the clothes of the boatman of Portovesme,
which are the clothes of the first act of “The
Pirates of Penzance.”
These kindly, child-like, yellow men were
amazingly different on the cliffs to the naked
hewers of the ochre stopes ; peaceful enough, but
something grim by reason of their shaven faces ;
and then their pirate dress hinted of the freedom
of the sea, the making a habit of lawlessness —
their only mentor, a sharpened-sense of everlasting
danger —their onlv jury, a cutlass, razor-keen.
The sea was very calm. There was only heard
from it a muffled roar as it broke into an old mine
working—the abandoned galleria di Camille.
But for that sound and the infrequent cry of a sea
bird, the -Painted Isle was silent—and silent
was the sea as if sound had been abolished from
Tunis to the Isle Des Ifs.
It only wants time and place to make a pirate,
and here was the place. Two miles away w'as a
felucca, sometimes lying in the calm and some-
times running for Cape Sandalo in the recurrent and
erratic wind.' And I wanted to be a pirate then,
because the felucca, whether in calm or motion,
was a thing of beauty in its form, and there was
the promise of a good easterly, and I had nothing
lo do for two hours. And when you have nothing
to do you are nearly ready to do somebody the
Satan who finds mischief for idle hands being
mostly high energy lacking channels of dissipa-
tion,
I skirted the cliffs, and lost sight of the sea as
I dipped into a fertile hollow of the hills ; where
grapes and prickly pear (here called not pere di
spina, which is the literal Italian for prickly pear, but
fichi di Moresco—fig of the Moor) grew luxuri-
antly—tempered from the heat by the sea winds,
and sheltered from the gales by the downs that
sprang to meet the painted cliffs.
The vines grew strongly among iron slugs, and
outside the cultivation was a low rampart of
thorny scrub which the sea winds had trimmed
to the regularity of a good box hedge. The scrub
did not trouble me, as I wore knee-boots, and in
them the inclination was to feel more piratical
than ever.
Graceful felucca, and blue sky and sea, and
white sun, and piratically-clothed miners and
flaming island—what a pity it was to have to
waste them all ! Here is a perfect setting for the
merry days of drinking and cutting throats ; with
fight and spoil waiting in every bay, and fear for
the peaceful trader when we shook out the Jolly
Roger to windward.
But the times are changed—the only opening
for a pirate to-day is buccaneering on the Stock
Exchange. Here are a few pages of the log of a
pirate of the 20th century :
12th. Captured a felucca bound for Naples, and took
her cargo of anice (a liqueur of anise-seed —very terrible
to be drunken on).
Have spared the crew for the present.
13th. Sampled the anice last night. Sampled it too
often. The mate and four of our best cut-throats died
at dawn ; so this afternoon we pelted the captured crew
to death with bottles.
16th. We are slowly recovering, and took a steamer at;
noon. On boarding her, found it was a circus ship short
of provisions. The menagerie was almost frantic for food.
Abandoned the prize in disgust at half after twelve.
L9th. Took another prize—an American tramp bound
for England, and loaded with railway material —captain
wanted to borrow limejuice from us. Shades of William
Kidd !
23rd. Another prize--a guano ship from Houtman’s
Ahrolhos to Glasgow. We abandoned this prize also, but
will eat the smell of it with our food for years tacome.
29th. Challenged a ship, which surrendered at once.
She was bound to Molokai with a cargo of lepers. Aban-
doned her also, but in a greater hurry than the other
abandonments.
30th. There’s no money in this business.
As soon as we can land, intend to sell the Jolly
Roger to a missionary, and play at honesty ashore.
The night came quickly and put an end to the
fooling. The sun set, the wind strengthened,
and the felucca rounded the Cape out of sight;
the Painted Isle lost its warring pigmentation,
and hue and shape were softened by the moon
haze.

The Grand Eternal Hearse.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THE grinding trains go rushing on,
The humming street trams fly,
The churning steamers ceaselessly
Across the ocean ply ;
And all of these have had their song,
But never yet in verse
Has salutation lifted to
The persevering Hearse.
It’s the hearse, the hearse,
Salute the trailing hearse !
The ready, steady transport
Where the ways of life disperse.
To some it is a blessing,
To some it is a curse ;
But it makes no bloomin’ difference
To the hearse.
I watch the sombre hearse go by
With plumes that nod to me,
As if to say, “ My cheerful friend,
Next trip it may he thee ;
And thou shalt ride enclosed in black
For thee shall be the pall.
The highway shall be cleared for thee.
Thou shalt dictate to all.
“ For I am free of all the ways
That wind within the world,
The boss conveyance laid on wheels
Horse-drawn or engine-whirled.
I take each passenger but once,
But, then, I take him far —
I am the final ride for man
Unless he mount a star.
“ Day in, day out, I take the trail
That leads from Here to There
A pauper now, a king anon
A hag or lady fair.
And all of them go silently,
Nor quarrel with me when
I stop before the gateway
Of the rotting place of men. ’
I saw the last plume nod its head ;
I marked the crawling pace,
And knew that speed upon the road
Could never win the race—
To get to where you’re going,
For better or for worse,
You’ve got to take it calmly
In the grand eternal hearse.
It’s the hearse, the hearse,
The patient, tireless hearse,
The amen locomotion,
Where the ways of life disperse.
’Mid the boasting and the vaunting,
And the daring and the daunting,
Bear in mind you’re booked to tra\el
By the hearse.

TH£ E>UOC£Rt£
Ejouror*
THE sinner’s pate is crimson-bald, and the
church flies walk thereon,
And lie sits in the tender-cushioned pew
and broods his sins upon ;
He dwells his scarlet sins upon, and the organ
growls and groans
That the end o’ the.world is coming soon, and he
feels it in his bones.
The sinner’s cab-horse waits without, propped up
in a hansom cab,
And a hansom cabman sits aloft, and his coat and
his hat are drab ;
And he takes a cynical view of the fare who will
shortly ride within ;
It takes a man and a horse to bring that sinner to
face his sin !
The road without is Sunday-still, and the cabman
sits and thinks
Of beautiful days on which he worked for people
who bought him drinks,
And the bright church-windows all are shut, for
the spring-time’s in the air,
And the ancient sinner drowsily bends down to
say a prayer.
litis prayer is all for him, and for the things he
loves the best—
A prayer to shift his gouty woes and the strange
pains in his chest,
And a prayer to keep his feet from off the Hell-
track, gay and wide,
With never a prayer for the hansom-man and the
horse that wait outside.
Last Sunday morn, on the Toorak-road, there
were three church-cabs a-rotv,
Three hansom-cabbies up aloft, three Carbines
down below ;
And three old, fatted sinners sat and groaned the
church zvithin —
Three horses and men to help three souls to shrive
themselves of sin!

The Tragedy of Mary Jones.
AND did you once know Mary Jones — ?
But, nay, that cannot be —
Yox you are scarce thirteen to-day,
While she’d be . . . forty-three !
My little lad, long, long ago
(Ere first you saw the sun),
Miss Jones and I agreed to try
The matrimonial “ One.”
Our lives became a tide of joy,
Devoid of grief or pain ;
The flying hours appeared and went
Each like an aeroplane.
And often we would walk at night
Along the river shore,
And mark the moon grow frail and pale
To hear the dog-star roar.
Then she, with pride ineffable,
Would say (my hand in hers),
“ There is no love in all the world
Compared to Christopher’s.”
The Lord forgive her for the lie
And free her of the blame ;
She loved another more than me . . .
Bill Smithers was his name.
She did not knoiy I knew her sin—
I kept within my breast
That secret, like the Spartan fox,
Beneath my flowered vest.
And, as of yore, whene’er we met,
I wore the same old smile ;
I even named the day and bought
A silk, two-storeyed tile.
The wedding-gown we too bespoke—
But hark, boy, while I tell
How down the very cogs of fate
My false fiancee fell !
October 4 (a Saturday),
We roamed the river side,
When, with a shout, I suddenly
Upset her in the tide.
“ Lie there,” I cried, “ wet Mary Jones,
Till Mister Smithers comes ! ”
Then sat me down, to watch her drown,
A-twiddling of my thumbs.

The Road.
I’VE got that summer feeling to-night—the
stars are. winking at me
As they did when the nights went by in the
whirl of a willing corroboree ;
lam Weary of being respectable I have got to
Cut loose or explode ;
So let’s get back to Bohemia — I haven t forgotten
the road !
I'm sick of the drone and the dust of things—the
daily talk of the shop ;
Let’s drive from town in a hansom cab, with a
barmaid sitting on top ;
And you can borrow my motor-car, the swiftest
money can buy,
With a chorus-girl in the trim tonneau, and your
hat cocked over your eye.
We'll all start fair with a drink apiece where
Pansy and Lulu are,
And chuck them under the chin for luck, and
jump them over the bar ;
And we'll all “ see life ” as we used to do, when
giddy young fools we were,
And none considered how far we went —so long
as we started fair !
We’ll all forget we are thirty-nine, and be as we
used to be
When money was made to be chucked away,
because we were twenty-three,
And a glancing eye and a dancing heel were still
desirable things,
And the curtain rose oh the stage of youth, and
laughter lurked in the wings.
For what if our best have gone beyond, and even
our wisest wived ?
Domestic drama is off to-night, and opera-bouffe s
revived ;
The cast is a spectral company, and the chorus
rings untrue —
But we who are thirty-nine are used to the voice
of a ghost or two.
The curtain falls— it is time to drink to the death
of yesterday,
With a long, long truce to the thoughts we think
- —they are dreary thoughts and gray . . .
Forget for once we are thirty-nine —in the red o’
the wine we’ll see
The red o’ the lips that taught us to kiss when we
were twenty-three.

YESTERE’EN, as I sat drinking
Dram by dram, and deeply thinking,
Came old Death, before me stood —
Sudden horror froze my blood.
Fierce he swung his mighty sickle —
“Gods !” I murmured. “ here’s a pickle ! ”
“ Come ! ” he cried, “ let tippling be.
Leave thy jug and come with me.”
“ Dear old Death,” I said, dissembling,
“ Take a seat,” I begged him, trembling ;
“ See, friend, here’s a glass for thee,
Take some wine and wait a wee.’’
Bony arm he straight extended,
Down he poured the liquor splendid ;
Drank to Plague and Pest and Pain,
Laughing, dropped his glass again.
“Now,” I thought, “he’ll surely leave me,”
But he turned to undeceive me :
1 ‘ Dost thou think a friendly glass
Sets thee free, thou vinous ass ? ”
“ Death,” I cried, “ a proposition !
Here on earth I’ll turn physician ;
Let me live, and thou shalt see
Half my patients, thine shall be.”
Loud he laughed with joy uproarious :
“ If thou keep thy promise glorious,
Thou shalt live, old Nose-a-fire,
Love and drink until thou tire.”
“ Death, thy words with rapture thrill me,
Death, with life anew they fill me ;
Charge thy goblet to the brim—
Here’s thy health, my comrade grim !
“ I shall live, O Death, for ever,
For I’ll tire of drinking never !
Ever shall I love my glass,
Ever gaily kiss my lass ;
“ Of my girl and goblet cheery
Never, never shall I weary ;
Ever Love and ever Wine
Deep shall glad this Soul of mine.”

The Last Boat.
TIIE sky was black with storm,
—across the night
Huge ragged clots of cloud
wooed sullenly
The timorous sun—the moon I meant to say,
Seeing ’twas night.—
From across the city
The distant belfry of the Bel more markets
Proclaimed the thirteenth hour ; the silver sound,
Ebbifig and flowing as it ricochetted
Along tb’ uneven streets.
Upon the quay--
I like these broken lines, they look the thing—-
Where the great vessels leave for Mosman’s Bay,
A weeping concourse met to bid adieu
To H.M.S. Kurraka, bound that night
To the far-distant Mosman.
From her top
P'launted the Blue Peter of departure,
Catching the sun —hie ! no, I mean the moon.
Stalwart and straight her skipper stood ; his face
A reflex of the night (by Jove, that's good !)
His eyes denoting courage, as he gazed
Into thick Night, and saw before his ship
Th’ interminable leagues of angry ocean
Hungry for human lives.
Aha I—the1 —the bell !
The bell clangs madly thro’ the day -the night
(Pardon, my recollection is a bit
Hazy and indeterminate. Yes, I’ll take
another.)
The gangway’s down ; —yet furiously the stragglers
Arrive, seizing from Rowlandson’s
The latest news, then falling in a gasp
Over the bulwarks of the mighty liner.
She moves, she throbs, she snorts —a cry : “ She's
off!”
And handkerchiefs are waved, or hats, or boots,
Or anything at hand.
Sorry the partings,
As the fierce sun—l mean the gentle moon—-
Peeps out atween the clouds, flooding the world
With a weird, tarnished brassy kind of light,
As one might see upon cheap silver spoons.
Bravely the great leviathan crept out,
Feeling her way thro’ the thick night ; aboard
Fond hope, and trustfulness within the master
Firm at his wheel, —full faith in his resolve
To pierce the darkness toward the distant Mosman,
Where those aboard trusted to wrestle Fate
For a gaunt livelihood among the rocks.
Such as, f’rinstance, growing the festive beet
In the back garden ; dodging the meter-man
What time the leaky hose pours forth its soul
Into the cauliflowers around the house —
Six rooms and kitchen, sewered and detached ;
The front Queen Anne, the back plain Mary Ann.
However, let us to our story keep.
Let's see the vast Kurraka with the mails—
Most of them tradesmen’s bills —aboard had
nosed—
Let’s see, did I use that word before ?
No ; then, had nosed her careful way
Into the storm. Very well, then; dark
And dismal grew the night ; the wind-fiend
howled
In grim, Satanic fury, while the clouds,
Like ghosts of decomposed souls, did float—
Ah, that’s the word ! —did float athwart the sky
In a weird shadow-show of light and shade.
We’ll take the rest for granted.
All went well
With the great vessel, save as on she passed
She nigh ran down the Kangarooster, bound
With a mixed cargo, mostly tradesmen’s carts,
To far-off Milson’s Point. The Kurraka
(Observe I’ve had to shift the accent here)
Dipt her the ensign, and, her portholes lit,
Sped on her journey.
Thro’ the seething storm
She passed, triumphant, ’round the point
Dubbed ICirribilli; —still the storm waxed worse ;
The lightning roared, the thunder flashed superb—
I'm slightly mixed ; excuse me, if you please !
A leetle water —not too much ; ’ere'sluck !
The days and nights sped on, and still the ship,
With dim lights burning in her hull—ah, no,
that’s, Dickens ! —-
With all sails set, weathered the ’wild’ring deep.
Off Musgrave-street she wallowed in the trough.
The hardy watchman lit a safety-match -
As signal of distress ; ’twas swift replied to
By a far-distant penny lantern, held
By a mad, zealous gardener, at work
Tracking down slugs in his back cabbage-patch.
Disgorging weary passengers, again
She rolled, like a suburban alderman,
Toward Cremorne. Aha ! —she’s on the rocks
Licking their lips to taste her—not too bad !
Aha ! —she’s saved. With a wild, gurgling cry
From the deck-hand of “ What-oh, there, she
bumps
She vomited another batch of hubbies
In frenzied haste to test the cabbage soup. .
Then, the fierce storm abating, she swung ’round
Toward Mosman; where, e'en to this day, the tale
Is told by pickled mariners, with locks
White with the winter of old age, and gout,
And whisky, and late hours of bestial riot,
How the Kurraka weathered out the storm.
Yes, just one more —I guess I’ll take it neat;
There’s no necessity to irrigate.

Views.
I STRIDE down Bourke-street, breathing the
fresh of an autumn day,
The girls with their luncheon-baskets look
pretty and cool and gay,
And the shop-boy cleaning the windows singelh a
roundelay.
Order and work and duty—maidens with straight,
sw'eet eyes—-
The wide, clean roadway bathing in the light o’
the warming skies—
And all of us finding Cornets in a world that’s
good and wise.
1 Conte dovtn Bourke-street laughing, and lurch-
ing a little, too,
And the gods who whisper found nte are Hone of
your gods that nte,
For I feel on my tongue the' fragrance of the sixth
good Barley Dew.
The Pug in the bar-room loafing is a stout, prim-
eval Man,
The furtive Hook on the pavement is part of the
Ancient Plan—
And the Barmaid flinging the glasses is a joysome
thing to scan.
He is a welcome brother who is whiling to make
things hum,
Who has no fear of the morning, nor worries of
Kingdom-come ;
And nobody need be thirsty, but nobody must be
glum.
I walk down Bourke-street jaded, and racked
with an Office Plead ;
And a dull and dismal picture of an empty life is
spread,
Where we slave in tiresome galleys to be stalled
and clothed and fed.
The smoke of factory altars spews gritty and hides
the sun ;
Like ants in a monstrous ant-hill, men struggle
and climb and run,
But come to their work with loathing, and longing
to get it done.
Drab are the damsels’ faces, and dull is the shop-
boy’s eye ;
They are little wheels in an engine, rolling re-
morselessly ;
And each spins round on an axle, till the moment
comes to die.
Brooding I go down Bourke-street, where the
thick-jawed loafers be,
And the face of the puff-eyed barmaid is a frightful
thing to see,
Where loathly vice has painted its horrible
mystery.
Life is a sea ; the swimmers leap on a w'ave sub-
lime
To shoot where the clean sand stretches ; but,
viewless, all the time
The undertow is racing out to the sunken slime.
Up through the street I hurry, troubled with
nameless fears ;
Bible stories of Sodom ring in my weary ears,
Till at last —howsweetand cleanly !—the Gardens’
green appears.
Duty and joy, or foulness ?-—golden or hopeless
gray ?
Something to hail exulting ?—something to bid
you pray ?
Which of all these is Bourke-street ?—And which
is the world to-day ?

PRIAM.
The Seven.
ONE daybreak, strolling through the
parks,
I met with seven patriarchs,
In seven eager attitudes,
Recounting night-till-morning larks.
Some had pine-needles in their locks,
And some were dressed in scarlet socks,
For they were merry Bacchanals ;
They took no thought of clothes and clocks.
The faces of the touzled brutes
Bore signs of seven kinds of scoots,
And they all laughed with simple glee
O’er their matutinal pursuits.
A bottle in the circle tipped,
And out of it the seven nipped ;
And all the seven mouths guffawed,
While dew drops down their whiskers dripped.
I thought, “ Here is a glorious week
Of orgies, sitting jowl-by-cheek,
What Saturnalian tales are told,
When all the seven satyrs speak ?
‘ ‘ What revelations of delight
’Twould be, with Bacchus on my right,
To cram the seven kinds of scoots
Into one wild luxurious night ! ”

A LONG DISCOURSE.
THE MEENISTER : “ Yes , sir, lam the new minister. Why this apparent amazement
McALISTER : “ Eh, mon, will the sairmons be similar tae yerse l'?”
THE baker, high upon his chariot, like Lars
Porsena, overlooked the little pittosporum
hedge. He observed that the front door of
the furnished cottage was open, and that in the
garden two foolish young people were making
open and shameless love under the fancied screen
of the ornamental shrubs. The baker had lost
his interest in Love's young dream when the twins
arrived—it must be the most steel-clamped, oak-
braced love which can survive twins. But he had
not lost his eye to business. He descended,
therefore, from his cart, opened the gate,
and entered, following his fortune. The
young people scattered confusedly as they
heard the click of the latch, the girl running
into the cottage, and the young man frowning
down the benignant regard of the baker. He was
a very fat baker, and his regard was extremely
benignant. But the young man was annoyed,
and dead to the bland humanity oozing from the
red face of the intruder.
“ Well, what d’ye want ? ” he inquired, shortly.
“.You ’ave a nice little ’ome ’ere, sir, if I may
make so bold,” said the baker, glancing about
with forced approval.
The young man, who was only looking over
the cottage, and had no intention of taking it,
agreed. He did not agree cordially, nor enter
into explanations. Why should he tell this
person that Celia didn’t care for the place because
there was a wasp’s nest over the door ? Confound
him ! Bursting in like that!
“ Well ! ” he said, discouragingly.
“ I suppose you ’aven’t told a baker to call yet,
sir ? ” said the bread-man, coming to the point.
“No, not yet.”
“Well, might I call? We make very good
bread —and pastry and ”
The Devil entered into the young man. He
smiled. “Do you make—er—wedding cakes ? ”
he inquired.
“ Oh, yessir ! ”
“Well, you see ” —with a sudden burst of con-
fidence—“ I’m going to get married on Wednes-
day. We move into the cottage then —we’re just
looking over it now. We propose to have the
—er —wedding breakfast in here, and leave my —
er—uncle to look after the place while we’re
away. And so—yes —you might make a cake
and anything else you think necessary. I daresay
you know what’s wanted better than I do. ”
The baker’s eyes glistened. This was a noble
young man. “Up to what price, sir? Do you
want”
The young man’s hand flung out grandly. “ I
leave all that to you, my good man. Never mind
the price. And, by the way, you might—but I
suppose you don’t do that.'"
“What, sir?”
“ Oh, arrange the whole affair, wedding break-
fast for eight people—the whole thing, you know
—turkeys, ices, confetti, champagne, and the
best man’s speech.”
“ Barrin’ the best man’s speech, sir,” replied
the innocent bread-man, “ we can do the ’ole
lot.”
The girl appeared at the door, and the young
man’s interest in the order flagged.
“ On Wednesday then,” he said, with an air
of dismissal.
“ What time, sir ? ”
“ About 9 o’clock.”
“ Yessir ! And—er—what name did you say,
sir ? ”
“ Walker,” answered the young man.
“I say,” he called out, as the baker receded.
‘ ‘ Yessir ! ”
“If you don’t find the cottage open —for we
won’t be here, you know—you just knock. My
uncle’s coming in on Tuesday night. He's a bit
hard of hearing. But knock. You don’t mind,
do you ? ”
“Lor’ bless me, no, sir,” chuckled the baker.
ZOOLOGICAL ITEM.
THE LADY: “ Why is your little brother crying so?"
THE LITTLE GIRL: “’Cos the little goat thinks that cow’s a wild bull.”
He departed dazed, his mind revolving about
the one golden phrase, “ Never mind the price,
He decided that he wouldn t. Even were this
wedding of that number which are not made in
Heaven, the young victims would look back to
the breakfast as a bright spot in their lives. He
whipped up his horse and galloped round the
corner, nearly running down a bottle-dealers
cart. The remarks on his appearance and slurs
upon his parentage slid, however, easily from the
complacency of a laborer worthy of his hire. It
was only at his boss’s blank stare of amaze that he
realised that he had forgotten to deliver the bread
to half his “ run.”
The young man heard the wheels rattle away
into the distance. He smiled. The girl shook
his arm impatiently.
“ What were you saying to that silly little fat
baker ? Tell me at once,” she commanded.
He told her.
“But you know I said We didn’t want the
house,” she cried. “ I won’t live in it!. I won't,
so there ! ”
“Neither will I, then,” replied the young man,
“ But then ! Why, he’ll come up here with all
those things, and
“ Good Heavens ! so he will ! ”
“Oh Dicky ! What did you do it for ? ”
“ His hide, my dear,” answered Dicky. “He
saw us over the hedge long before he came in,”
She flushed hotly. “Oh, do you think so ?
Well then, I hope he does come up. The little
beast ! You ought to have hit him, Dicky.”
“ I guess I have hit him,” replied the young
man.
It was quite upon the cards that the baker
would come, even as Dicky (who here passes with
Celia from the story) had prophesied. But be-
hold ! Coincidence worked even greater evil
against him. For the stars in their courses sent,
at 8 a. m. on Wednesday—the policeman being then
in the apogee of his beat—Dirty Dan, to the plun-
dering of the “furnished cottage, four rooms,
kitchen, washhouse, and all modern improve-
ments.” For one can usually pick up quite a lot
of little things in a furnished cottage.
Dan was disappointed. He had looked for
some small booty, but one cannot carry chairs or
bedsteads in a sugar-bag. He pouched the
crockery, growling, for it was sadly indifferent
crockery. He turned in despair to the gas fittings.
“ Might’s well ’ave bin a plain empty,” he mut-
tered savagely. Then he paused, with a bronze
weight in his hand. For the rattle of a cart
had stopped before the cottage. Then came
the click of the gate-latch. “ Struth ! ” he
whispered, diving for shelter. Steps passed from
the front to the rear of the house. He remembered
that he had left the back door open, lost his head,
and ran to close it. But as he reached it the fat
face of the baker peered in. Dan gasped.
Should he stoush the intruder with the weight, or
do a plain bolt ? The baker thought that such a
well set-up nephew might have seen that his uncle
had a shave and a wash upon this important
occasion.
“ I’ve brought the things, sir,” he said.
“ Wot things ? ” asked Dan.
“ The breakfast your nevvy ordered.”
‘ ‘ Ah —yus. ”
“ Shall! bring ’em round ’ere, sir, or will you
hopen the front door ? ”
“Bring ’em round ’ere, me good man,” said
Dan. lie had recovered. And for the next few
minutes he was smitten with admiration and
gratitude to the gods at the good things the baker
thrust upon him. He remembered in his dim
remote youth paying sixpence to hang over the
gallery at a pantomime, where a demon brought a
Chow kid a meal every time said kid rubbed a
dirty old brass lamp. This was It. Only he
wasn’t a Chow kid, and he had no lamp.
“ That’s the lot, sir,” declared the baker.
Then he ran into the realms of hypothesis, seeing
the “’appy couple walkin’ hup the haisle.” He
declared that it was a lottery. “ That’s what it is
—a lottery ! ”
‘ ‘ Pak-a-pu ? ” inquired Dan.
“ Marriage,” replied the baker. “ But—let's
’ope this un turns out well. Your nevvy’s a fine
young bloke —very free-’anded. Not but wot
they change arter bein’ benedictines for a couple
o’ year.”
So Dan discovered that his nephew' was being
married. It gave him confidence —he could even
face the gas-meter man now.
“ I’ll call hevery day for horders, sir,” said the
baker, his hand upon the little gate which led
away from the back yard.
“Yus, cert’nly, me good feller,” replied Dan.
Interruption came again ere Dan had finished the
best meal he had known in his life. But he was
bold now with the knowledge of a respectable
nephew to back his doings, and the courage of
half a bottle of champagne. He faced the milk-
man with a turkey’s leg in his hand.
He took the milk as one born to the estate of
householder. He even dared, much to the milk-
man’s disgust, to criticise its quality. “My
nevvy,” he declared, “ ’as got a milk-tester —so
just you look out, me lad.”
“ Wot d’ye mean ? ” inquired the tradesman.
“ Don’t you bail hup the cow with the hiron
tail too frequent,” answered Dan.
The milkman choked ; but, remembering the
bad influence of honesty on trade, refrained.
Dan, until io o’clock, had the morning of his
life. He bullied the butcher and cross-examined
the grocer as to the percentage of sand in the
sugar. He fed the sparrows in the yard on
wedding-cake, and gave the remains of a turkey
to a prowling cat. Then, having discarded the
indifferent crockery in favor of the flesh pots of
Egypt, he departed, meeting the suspicious regard
of the local policeman in the next street. “Just
in time,” he thought. The policeman was going
to ask what he had in the bag. Dan saw the
question in his eye, and answered it before it
reached his lips.
“ Say, mate,” said he, “d’ye know where the
soap-fact’ry is abart ’ere ? ”
“Fat?” asked the cons.able, nodding, at the
bag.
“ No,” answered Dan, grinning, “a weddin’
breakfast. ’ ’
“ None o’ yer hoide,” said the policeman.
“ But where’s the fact’ry ?” insisted Dan,
“ Goin’ to buy soap? Don’t you do lit; after
bein’ so long without ut, ut moight kill you.”
Dan smiled at the policeman’s back. He could
afford to despise the cheap gibe. Was it four
bottles of fizz he had in the bag, or five ? Was it
a turkey and two fowls or two turkeys and a fowl ?
One thing he knew, he had one bottle of fizz in a
place whence even the Law could not extract it.
God had indeed justified the efforts of the poor
wanderer. And in the wilds of Woolloomooloo
that night was joy and revelry and feasting
in one dirty little room ; but in the tents of Shem
was wrath and sorrow, and a fat baker-man had to
look round for a new job.

The Bush.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
INSTEAD er writin’ of ther town er of ther local
push,
Ain’t it strange ther city poets mos’ly write
about ther bush ?
They writes o’ merry bushmen ridin’ under glori-
ous stars,
Er of songbirds, an’ of rivers “ripplin’ o’er their
sandy bars ! ”
But I guess they’d change their singin’ if they’d
hump their swags an’ come
Out ter these hills an’ gullies where ther diggers
dig fer gum !
With scrub —grey scrub—fer scenery, that is ther
bush-world grand !
Wheer are ther rivers ? Muddy creeks run out
across ther land !
This is ther glorious country wheer ther songbirds
sing sweet songs—
(Theer ain’t no birds, but bushflies buzz aroun’ yer
head in throngs) ;
Come poets, here’s yer country—scrub an’ clay
an’ clay an’ scrub—
Fifteen miles from any homestead, twenty miles
from any pub.
They never mentions cold, wet days—perhaps
these blokes forgot—
But they writes o’ “sunny afternoons,” which
same are blazin’ hot !
Never speaks er frosty mornin’s—mebbe these
ain’t in their line —
Er of chilly, cheerless ev’nings when the cold
creeps down yer spine ;
Seem ter think ther bush is Heaven, an’
they quite forget ter form
Visions of er poor gumdigger strugglin’
homeward thro’ a storm !
An’ ther “careless-hearted” bushmen —I
suppose it’s us they mean—
Well, the most I’ve met are gloomy—merry
once they might have been ;
Rough an’ grumpy, old ’n’ broken, mos'ly
slow ’n’ short er breath —
(’Ad they ther cash they’d be ther fust ter
drink themselves ter death !)
Some of ’em well-eddicated —now but
driftin’, shiftless wrecks —
Scrapin’ livin’ from ther gumfields, drinkin’
Hell-fire with their cheques !
An’ ther poets speak er glorious stars that
on their courses roll —
Ther stars—l hate ther silent stars —they
seems ter wake yer soul ;
Fer they makes yer feel so lonesome that
yer thoughts go all astray —
Sets yer thinkin’, dreamin’, ponderin’ of
places far away ;
Of ther girls yer might have married in ther
days afore yer fall,
Till yer wish ther were no heavens, an’ no blanky
stars at all.
An’ look at me this bakin’ day—alone, ’neath
blazin’ skies —
Me home, er leaky whare, roughly built, on
yonder rise ;
Scrub, nothin’ but grey scrub fer view—north,
east, ’n’ south ’n’ west —
(Ther flies are buzzin’ roun’ me now—won’t give
er cove er rest).
. . . Come out, yer city poets, come ’n’ join me
in ther scrub,
Fifteen miles from any homestead —twenty miles
from any pub.

The Grey Lake.
(Lake Eyre , S.A.)
FAR away tb Southward
The grey lake lies.
Thirty leagues of mud, bare
To turquois'e skies.
Shallow, Sluggish \Vater
Warm—warm as blood ;
Not enough to cover
The quaking mud.
Dot winds drive the waters
In summer-time
Southward—and behind them’
There lies grey Slime.
1’Vjrty miles" to' westward,
A hundred north,
Wind fiends chase the watef
Backward a!nd forth.
There are reed-grown islands
Seen through a glass —
Drey ooze guards them grimly
Thalt none may pass.
Strange things may survive there*
For who can tell ?
Monsters old —the lake slime
Can guard them well.
No one knows those islands ;
The gulls that fly
They can go, but others
Would surely die.
For the wind-scourged water
Would flee the ships,
And the mud would open
Its soft, smooth lips. . . .
So the isles are sacred
From human tread,
Since the slime can swallow
And keep its dead.
Who can know 7 its secrets?
The blue sky might—■
(Cloudless-hot in daytime,
Star-gemmed at night).
To and fro for ever
The water swings ;
And the gulls fly over,
For they have wings.

At Dawn.
OVER the dim.grey sea
Flares the red light of the dawning, and
its royal banners unfold ;
And a path through the amethyst shadows comes
flashing in light to me,
From the east, where the wavelets sparkle and
gleam in the morning gold.
This is the same old place ;
The cape stretching out to the left, and the golden
beach curved to the right,
The waves on the brown rocks breaking like
masses of rainbow lace,
And out by the green cliffs looming the wings of
the gulls lash white.
’Tis a faery magic fills
The dim-lit hour of the dawning, the sands, the
cliffs and the sea,
When the veil of the mist is lifted from the face of
the sapphire hills.
The calm, the hush and the wonder are sacred
and sweet to me.
O shadow of childhood’s days !
The treasures of youth long wasted, the seasons’
swift ebb and flow ;
Ye are part of the scenes unchanging and part of
the olden ways ;
But where is the heart that loved you ten weari-
some years ago ?
I am growing old too fast,
For my heart is as grey as the storm-cloud, though
ever my head be brown ;
But never the mill shall grind with the waters
once gone and past ;
And where is the use re-reading the leaves that
are once turned down ?
Yet over the dim, grey sea
The flaring lights of the dawning their crimson
banners unfold.
And the., gold of the gleaming pathway shines
burnished and bright to me.
As the path of the past is fadihg in colors of grey
and gold.

LITTLE brown violin, breathe to my lover
All the sweet secrets I’ve whispered to thee 5
Hum like a bee in the heart of the clover,

Mixed Verses
WRITTEN FOR “THE BULLETIN.”
Our Mentor.
OUR story opens at the Frantic Cow,
Within whose pallor, we, its patrons,
met.
We were A club, recruited Anyhow,
And these our gath'rings homely were and
wet.
tlpon an easy Chair our Mentor sat,
While on its mate his feet a refuge found ;
but no one grudged the dear old autocrat
The right to spread his languid limbs around.
For was he not a man of intellect ?
(The greatest in these Austral lands, I think)
Whose burning words were only to be checked
By asking him to “ nominate his drink.”)
Now next our Mentor sat our honored guest —
An uncut jewel, raucous, rough and red-
illiterate was he and, for the rest,
Well known Outback in every shearing shed.
Ill’s name was Bill, and, being fond of sport,
He asked our Mentor who would win the Test
Just then in progress. Came the swift retort,
“ Who never guesses guesses ofttimes best ! ”
The hairy Bill, astonished, eyed him o’er,
While to his face a dazed expression crept ;
He edged a little closer to the door,
And for a while a puzzled silence kept.
But circling drinks and silence are opposed,
And, anyway, it went against Bill’s grain
To sit mewed up and mute, so he unclosed
His face, and shortly waded in again.
Said he : “I think I’ll win me blimey bet
On this ’ere match ! ” Our Mentor answered :
“ Yes ?
Such things, alas, transcend the Final Yet,
Though Causal Impulse wane to Nothingness ! ”
Here he broke off, nor aught would further say
Upon the subject, or for ill or good,
Except that “ To the confines of the Nay
The Monad sank despite its Otherhood.”
It was a verbal punch below the belt ;
Bill gasped, and took the count with sullen
grace,
And from that blow so full at d squarely dealt
His conversational demise took place.
But now his second wind our Mentor found ;
As, braced by beer, the vocal chalk he toed,
It seemed each phrase was chosen to astound,
So apt it was, so bright its wisdom glowed.
As thus when, touching on the world-old theme
Of woman’s likeness to a moistened hen,
He cried, “ On the antennae of a Dream
Seek not to latitudinise the When ! ”
Then, when he later grew discursive o’er
The limitations of a household broom,
“ Such things,” he cried, “ were ne’er constructed
for
The widening sweep of cataclysmic Doom ! ”
But let us hasten to the tragic close
Of that historic meeting at the Cow.
Long years have passed, but still I blow my nose
Whene’er my thoughts revert to it —as now !
Our Mentor worked by strong and virile flights
Round to his favorite topic, and explained
How every sentient atomy delights
To quarrel with its future fore-ordained.
“ That man ! ” he said, with glance and gesture
bent
Upon old Bill, our guest from Nevertire,
“ That man, though once a Dulcet Instrument,
Fast threatens to become a Blasted Lyre ! ”
In boiling rage upsprang that hairy man,
Gurgling weird curses on the ear of Night,
And with no warning, save a yell, began
To disarrange our Mentor’s psychic light.
He reached his fated victim where he sat,
And, swift in brawny arms enfolding him,
He shook him as a terrier a rat,
While we grow limp with dread beholding him.
Gratis he did some tricks well worth a crown.
He tossed our Mentor up and let him fall ;
Then, hoisting him again, he dumped him down
With vibrant crash among the glasses all.
Then seizing up his hat he glared around —
Glared lastly at his victim lying stark—■
And, landing at the door with one long bound,
Strode forth, with maledictions, through the
dark.
Our Mentor won back tardy consciousness
Only to murmur with a hard-drawn sigh,
“ The Greater Power did grate upon the Less —
I go to solve the Wherefore of the Why ! ”

The Long Night.
FARING away to the west,
Facing what there may be ;
Respite and splendid rest,
Over the last black sea.
While yet our lives are free,
Let us go on with a song,
For no birds sing in the Mystery,
And the night is long.
To-day is one thund’rous youth.
Life with its happy eyes
Threatens no wrong nor ruth,
No darkling sacrifice.
Under the pale warm skies
Let us go with a song,
For cometh a day when no dawn shall rise,
And the night is long.
Youth, and the music thereof,
Lure us with all desire,
Lure us with eyes of love,
And a heart shot through with fire ;
Dance to his throbbing lyre,
Let us go on with a song,
For day by day the shade creeps nigher,
And the night is long.
Every day hath i's sweet,
Roses of joy divine ;
Pluck them, ere winter’s feet
Bruise them with dire design ;
Cherish them warm and fine.
Let us go on with a song—•
In the garden of Death no blooms may shine,
And the night is long.
Here where the feast is spread,
Flagons of wine a-row,
Lean to them, brave and red ;
Drink, ere the fervors go,
A long, deep draught and slow ;
Let us go on with a song,
For bitter the cup at the stroke of woe,
And the night is long.
Friend of my heart, this way
We travel with no return.
Joyaunce while yet you may,
Light-hearted, with faint concern.
So, while the pulses burn,
Let us go on with a song,
For cometh a sorrow that none may spurn,
And the night is long.

Mary.
PEACE is on the smiling roomscape, books
and papers, table, chairs,
Of the unromantic diggings where I write
and say my prayers ;
Cool tobacco fragrance lingers, blessing crowns
my brimming cup,
Until Mary brings the duster and begins to tidy up
Mary’s smart, and Mary’s pretty ; she has eyes of
sweetest blue,
And her hair’s a rosy-orange, sort of tiger-lily hue.
She is active, she is agile, and her slippers spurn
the ground
When she starts her operations and the duster’s
flicking round.
Mary sings while she is working. Great Apollo,
how she sings !
How the leaves of paper rustle at the whirring of
her wings !
How the antiquated timbers sound with thunders
as of doom
While she punctuates her music with the banging
of the broom.
(Did I want to be poetic, I should say that Mary’s
sire
Was an energetic cyclone that got tethered in a
choir ;
That her mother was a whirlwind that had tried
to settle down
To a life of steaming soap-suds in a dingy street
in town.)
I have met with storm and tempest on the bosom
of the main,
I have faced a fierce nor’-wester on the Canter-
bury Plain,
I have felt an old-man earthquake, and a big bush
fire is hot,
But when Mary’s in her glory the commotion
licks the lot.
Woe is on the rigid roomscape, sadness creeps
across the floor,
There are sudden strips of language floating out-
ward to the door,
Nothing’s left where I can find it, curses overflow
my cup,
Though the room looks “nice and tidy” after
Mary’s straightened up.

A Ballade of Departure.
WHEN you, and I, and everyone we
know—
The baby, and the cat, and the
canary—
Are all tucked in our little beds below,
Or are tinkling on our harps in regions airy*
It’s oh, but oh !
How the merry world will go !
Though we won’t know what is going on about us;
We haven’t long to stay;
And when we slip away
The dance will jog on cheerily without uS:
When you, and I, and the gentlemen and JeWS
Are sitting on the hobs of Satan’s regions,
I wonder if we’ll weep for the fun we had to lose
When we dropped our swags to join immortal
legions !
It’s oh, but oh !
Will we find it very slow
When there are not any girls to trust ot doubt us ?
Will we envy other chaps,
With our girls upon their laps*
Who seem to get on rippingly without us ?
When you, and I, and the boys that love the booze'.
The spielers and the parsons and attorneys,
Have left our cast-off togs for the other men to
use,
And paid our little fares and booked our
journeys,
It’s oh, but oh !
Will the whisky cease to flow ?
Will St. Peter lake us round the side and shout us?
Will we find it very dry
In the mansions of the sky,
While our pals below are lining up without us ?
I’ve often heard it said that we’ll be a long time
dead,
And we’d better have our fun before we’re
buried
In a dull, damp, dismal grave, in a narrow
wooden bed,
While our ghosts across the Stygian stream are
ferried.
It’s oh, but oh !
Let us sup before we go ;
Let us collar all the sport that’s round about us ;
Let us liven up the trip,
For, when we’ve got to skip,
The world we’ve left will scrape along without us.

The Message.
I WANDERED by the shore one day to live
again in dreaming
The old days and the sweet days dead and
done ;
The sea was like a field of flax in blossom,
laughing, gleaming,
And joyous with the joy of wind and sun.
The waves came charging on the beach in spark-
ling silver smother,
I said, “ You have some news for me, O Sea
She said “ I am of Beauty, Life, and Love, and
Change, the mother ;
But all the poets ask too much of me.”
I lived upon the mountains for a little time, and
hated
Their studied rest, their calm and stolid pose ;
They would have been volcanoes had they been
by me created—
Life, love, are in the Sea and in the Rose.
The plains, as I have heard, are clothed with
mystery and magic,
But still the same, when all is said and done—
The same old scene, the same old crow, the same
old mirage tragic,
And solitary rider in the sun.
The Sea is the great preacher, sobbing, singing,
laughing, sighing,
So wild, so calm, so sad, so new, so strange.
I know, thank God, the message that she has for
me when dying—
Eternity is simply Endless Change.
V. J. DALEY.
The Book of Dream.
I read in the untroubled Book of Dream
Of beatific things,
Lovely imaginings,
The splendid pomp and pageants of old kings—
Gleam upon golden gleam !
Each glamored line
To my enraptured vision
Under unclouded arches sapphirine
Made revelation and interpretation
(Ah, but they seemed divine !)
Of sights that swam elusive yet elysian ;
From rune to silver rune rippled the theme
Of the charmed Book of Dream,
Until it touched on love, and on your name
Girt as with morning flame.
There was I fain to dwell,
Brooding above each lyric syllable ;
But nay —eclipse !
What broke the spell,
Darkened the beam,
Closed the sweet Book of Dream ?
Your laughter, and swift after
Your kiss upon my lips !

The MULTIPLYING and VANISHING BILLIARD BALL TRICK■
Unique Billiard Ball.
gd
By far the best and most effective billiard
ball trick ever invented. This is a superior
method to any other billiard ball trick ever
yet performed. The pecularity of it is that
the balls can be given for examination as
they are produced, to show they are solid.
The performer having turned up his sleeves
and shown his hands empty, gives a minia-
tuie billiard ball, about one inch in diame-
ter, for examination. The audience being
satisfied, he takes it in his left hand and
passing his right band over it shows two
Again a mystic pass, and there are three'
winch he shows are quite solid. The audi-
ence now see, to their astoni-hmet, four
balls. These gradually vanish one after the
other, till there is only one left, which is
again passed round for examination. An
adequate description cannot be given of this
most delightful effect. If is one of the
pi ettiest little sleights seen for a long' time,
the billiard ball set is made in '" ivoriue *'
and can be made in any size. The illustra-
tion will give our customers some idea of
the enect that can be obtained with tins complete set. The sleeves are turned
back whilst performing this trick the whole time, the hands shown empty and
at any minute, whilst the trick is beiug performed, the balls can be passed for
inspection.
This trick requires no sleight of hand, and can be performed by any person.
The halls can be made to multiply or vanish at the will of the operator.

The Private Bar.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Oil this is a song of the Private Bar,
A sixpenny bar we’ve seen ;
With its odor of lemon and stale cigar,
And a Japanese folding screen.
Where the ’lectric fan, with its whirling blade,
Cuts chunks off the drinker’s breath ;
And the rouge on the cheeks of the gilded maid
But masketh the face of Death.
Oh this is a song of the Private Bar,
The shrine of the Sinful Hours ;
Where staid old gents from the “ subbubs ” far
Deposit their choicest flowers,
That were “ cut for the Hospital, yes, my dear,”
When the “ missus ” begins to ask ;
But they droop and die in the breath of beer
On the top of a varnished cask.
Oh this is the song of a Red Retreat,
Where you dive from the crowded Block,
To a succulent brew from the good ox meat
With toast at eleven o’clock.
Where you soothe the qualms of the Night Before,
And banish a vain remorse,
As you drown the voice of the Never No More,
And chatter of Girl and Horse.
Oh this is a song of the Private Bar,
The haunt of the Joyous Jays ;
Where the flower-man scenteth his prey afar,
And selleth his faded “ sprays " ;
Where the chocolate boy and the violet kid
Take a hand in the blackmail too,
With the jew’ellery-hawking T. P. Yid,
And the rest of the vampire crew.
Oh this is a song of the Silken Nest,
And the Bird in the Gilded Cage ;
Where the Wool King cometh from out the West,
And the heathen delights to rage ;
A song of the Temple of Lurid Larks,
And the Bacchanalian grove,
Where the cinnamon sheddeth its scented barks,
With the coffee bean and the clove.
Oh this is a song of Vain Desires,
The song of Eleven O’Clock,
When the furtive hansom with rubber tyres,
Steals silently down the Block ;
A song of the swish of a silken skirt,
As the Queen vacates her Throne,
And the maudlin masher whose name is Dirt,
When the fighting man claims his own.

HORACE HALLORAN.
Ra.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
HELZBERG was glancing over the list of
approved shifts when Murchison came in.
He swung round at once.
“ I say, Murchison, ’tisn’t true that you’ve
named young Kirkman for Paikota ? ”
“ Quite true, my son. Why not ?”
“ Good God, man, you’ve got rats ! Kirkman
and Paikota! Chalk an’ cheese.” Helz-
berg, who was an excitable individual, fairly
snorted. “ Why, he’s the bright particular planet
of half the Christian Endeavor and Moral Im-
provement societies round Auckland. Paikota !
He'll have to convert the Maoris there. The
w'hites up that way are past redemption.”
Murchison laughed a little uneasily.
“ It’s a bit rough on him,” he admitted, “ but
the fact of the matter’s this : Kirkman's getting
on my nerves. He’s turning the checking room
into a debating society. I don’t mind religion in
its place, but he s got no sense, and doesn't
know when to stop. Young Cohen, the best
figgererin the whole caboose, threatens to leave if
he isn’t shifted. There's a mission enrolment
craze on, and he’s worrying everybody, and Cohen
says that the man that enrols him will have to
climb over his dead body to do it. Bah ! A
shift will do Kirkman good. He’s more like
a boy of eighteen than a man of eight-and-twenty.
Besides, Richards, boss policeman and clerk and
registrar and various other things for the district, is
an old chum of mine, lie'll keep an eye on the
young ass.”
So Kirkman went to Paikota, and he received
several cheap rugs and travelling bags and cases,
prior to his departure, as the usual “mark of
the esteem and affection in which our young
brother is held.”
Also he found that what Helzberg had told
Murchison re his and Paikota’s suitability each to
the other was right. It was a timber-getting
district on the edge of Nowhere. The people
w ere a rough crowd, and all attempts at forming
debating and home-mission societies w'ere met
with scorn mingled with liquor. There w'ere only
a handful of whites in the place, a wild, hard-
riding, hard-living set, and the priggish young
bank manager was a puzzle to them.
Asa result, Helzberg’s prediction; was fulfilled.
He turned his attention to the Maoris, and white
Paikota contented itself with hunching its broad
shoulders and calling him an adverbial young
fool.
But all the epithets that the district collectively
had bestowed upon him were as nothing compared
to the string of profanity let loose by Richards
when Kirkman presented himself in his office with
Tuarie, the quarter-breed from the pa, and de-
sired to be married by special license immediately.
“Go home to ya’ mammy,” said Richards.
“ Great Scot, man, she’s half the breeds under
the sun, and Maori over the lot. You’re mad.”
Kirkman said he was sane. He said also that
he had asked the Lord's guidance in the matter.
“Oh, stow it,” snapped Richards. “You
don’t know what you're doing. Everybody for
twenty miles round knows her an’ her mother
before her. Ye gods ! ”
“ I know all there is to know about her," said
Kirkman, with a new dignity in his perennially
boyish voice, “and I intend to make her my
wife.”
Richards hedged. “If you’re so dashed reli-
gious,” he asked, “ why not wait till the end of
the quarter, when the parson conies up ? ’"
“ Because 1 desire to be married now. I
demand to be married” was the eloquent
answer.
“ You can keep on,” said Richards. “ I won’t
do it, an’ that’s flat. If you know the truth about
her you must be off your chump, an' if you don’t,
an’ you marry her an" find out, you’ll go off.”
Then Kirkman made a long speech, with
frequent references to “God’s brown people,”
and universal brotherhood, and the importance of
the assimilation of races for the good of posterity,
and love, and kindred subjects, always with him-
self as a glorified junior “shepherd” posing
largely in the foreground. He wound up by
saying that he was assured that the Lord's blessing
would rest on their union, and again he demanded
immediate marriage.
So in the end Richards, who, despite his bluff,
could do nothing else, consented to call in a couple
of witnesses and fix the matter up.
His marriage exhortation was brief and biting—
“ You neither of ye know what ye’re in fur, an’
ye’re a pair o’ young fools.”
Then he sat dowm and indited a letter to Mur-
chison, in which he called that high and mighty
personage seventeen distinct kinds of objection-
able animals, and himself many unkind names for
not foreseeing the unforeseeable. But it was the
tail of that letter which worried Murchison. The
tail was clear and direct. “I know enough of
the girl to know that if you don’t shift Kirkman
down to the city, or anywhere out of reach of
this cursed pa, there'll be the Devil to pay.
You've indirectly got him into this rotten mess, and
I think it’s about up to you to get him out as far
as you can.”
And because of this it fell out that, ten days
after his marriage, Kirkman received notice that
Teddy Balfort w'as coming up to take his place,
and that he himself was appointed second clerk at
the office in Auckland.
Wherefore, that night, Kirkman prayed long
and fervently in his thankfulness, getting cold feet
in the process, to Tuarie’s great disgust. Tuarie
DISGUISED IN
LIQUOR.—AT A
WAYSACK BALL.
GENTLEMAN (to
young lady): “ A How
me to present to you my
friend, Mr. Jones. He's very
drunk just now, but you'll fend him an awfully nice fellow when you know him.”
never could understand the religious fervor which
ignored cold feet.
Kirkman made him a home at North Shore,
and, because it was in his nature to be so, he was
proud of his rather bizarre union ; for Tuarie
made him a good wife, and he used her many
times as an illustration of the truth of his much
trumpeted belief in Universal Brotherhood.
But racial instincts are strong, and Tuarie was
the child of many races. Her mother was the
daughter of a French Creole and a Maori ; her
father the son of a Portuguese w oman and a Chilian
mariner. Oh ! it was a rich blending, but the
fruit of it was bad and bitter, and it was a hard
struggle for Tuarie to live in this atmosphere of
enforced goodness with all her soul warring
against it. So, when she lost in the fight, it
wasn't her fault. God knows she struggled
against unconquerable Nature long enough.
They had been in Auckland six months before
she acknowledged herself beaten, and then Kirk-
man, coming home one night, came, for the first
time since their marriage, to an empty house. He
supposed that Tuarie had stopped somewhere 01-
other to tea, so he let himself in with his own key,
and prepared and ate his meal good-humoredly.
Kirkman didn’t begin to w orry till the last ferry
had come in. Then he admitted to himself that
he felt a little anxious. Still, being of an un-
imaginative turn of mind, he accepted the easiest
solution of the problem, and supposed Tuarie had
been detained at a friend’s house, and had missed
the boat. And because he knew nothing of the
tricks that mixed blood can play, he w'ent to the
office next morning with the full expectation of
seeing his wife when he returned.
Instead, he came again to an empty house.
He was thoroughly alarmed now, and his first
thought was the police. But before he consulted
them he did a much better thing ; he bethought
him of Ra. Ra was the house dog, a great brute,
three parts St. Bernard and one bloodhound. The
dog of mixed breeds was devoted to the woman
of mixed blood, and it w'as his mournful howling
for his mistress that called him to Kirkman s
notice.
They v ent out together—the man driven by
anxiety, the dog led by instinct. They crossed
the ferry together, Ra leading the way. In the
city the dog lumbered inquiringly through many
streets. At last he loped confidently down an ill-
lit lane leading to the waterways. There, in a
surreptitious drinking house frequented by the
Maoris and their associates, in the midst of sin,
naked and glaring as in all his life he had never
seen or dreamed of it, Kirkman found his wife.
He took her to a reputable place for the night.
There Tuarie slept herself into forgetfulness, and
was much incensed at being roused in the early
morning to pray for the regeneration of her soul.
That was Ivirkman’s weakness. He trusted too
much to a religious feeling his wife did not possess,
and the result w : as just what might have been
anticipated.
Tuarie’s taste of freedom had been sweet, and
because of his foolishness she despised her
husband, so it came about that after that night
life became horrible for Kirkman.
The boyish look that had so annoyed Murchison
gave place to a look of age that worried him more.
He persisted in blaming himself for the hash
Kirkman had made of his life, forgetting that
Kirkman was one of those who are able to order
all lives but their own.
Very often now Ra and his master crossed by
the ferry on their search, and always Kirkman
reasoned with, pleaded with, and on the surface
forgave his wife, and always for a week or so
Tuarie forced herself into a spasm of religious
zeal and was the worse for it when her next out-
break fell due.
Kirkman told none of his trouble, but by-and-
bye the whole staff knew, for Auckland is not
immense, and young men fraternise in strange
places. Nobody ever mentioned the matter in
Kirkman’s presence, but when he was out of the
way there was many a wager made as to whether
“ the beggar’s keepin’ straight or not,” and when
she was walking the chalk-line of righteousness
the staff made bets as to how long said straight-
ness would last.
It was never very long, and Kirkman was
beginning to own himself a little tired of his right-
eous attitude, but the climax came one night
when he and the dog, on their usual errand, fell
across young Anstey hunting for them. The
boy’s face was very red as he told how he had
found Tuarie, and had dragged her off to a decent
hotel till he could find Kirkman.
“ I shouldn't have been there myself, and that’s
solid truth,” he said. “ I don’t know whether
I’ve done right or not,” he added, defiantly, “ but
anyway it wasn’t a place I’d like my wife to be in,
if I had one.”
That tone of pity roused Kirkman to a more
solid anger than even the open shame of it all.
To be pitied —he, the little tin joss of half the
church societies in Auckland, he the little god (he
had deified himself in virtue of his forbearance),
he
Tuarie w 7 as rather astonished that night. Also,
for the first time, she respected her husband a
little. Hitherto there had been much reasoning
and many prayers. Now there was nothing but
flat command.
“ You’re not fit to be trusted,” said Kirkman,
“so in future you will not go out without me.
You shan’t plead loneliness, for you can keep a
servant. I know what will happen if you do go
out, and I tell you for the first time and the last
that if I ever see or hear of you like this again I
shall not take you back. You understand ? ”
Then for a time there was peace, and Kirkman
regained his old self-complacency and displayed
the old blatant contempt for all w'ays of thinking
save his own. He did it to such a degree that
Murchison ceased to accuse himself of life-wreck-
ing, and even Helzberg, the inspector and
scoffer, admitted that things were not so bad.
But Kirkman, hurrying home one night to
escort Tuarie to an unutterably prim and dreary
meeting at which he was to be chief speaker,
found only the servant in the house. Her mis-
tress had left no message behind her.
Kirkman took his meal without comment and
went out.
Ra scented mischief, and, moreover, he enjoyed
these hunts for his mistress through Auckland's
byways. Now he was nonplussed to find the gate
shut in his face. Me wandered about aimlessly
till Kirkman returned from the prim and dreary-
meeting, and finding that he had come alone the
animal lifted his huge voice and bayed bitterly.
Kirkman half hoped by next evening that
Tuarie would have returned. He had decided
that, whilst he might not seek her, he would
exercise a Christian generosity if she should return
of her own accord.
But Tuarie did not come back, and as the week
went by the craving for the old freedom grew
strong, and in her veins the primal Maori blood
ran hot.
Some of her companions from the pa at Paikota
were down in Auckland by an evil chance, and
with them when they returned went Tuarie.
And it was thus it happened that three weeks
later, Ra, footsore and hunger-lean, found her in
a filthy whare, joyfully drunk, and greasy from
much fat pork.
Tired of the narrow life that seemed bounded
by a garden and a bone, he had waited a little while
for his mistress, and then in broad daylight had
openly absconded. His keen hunting instinct
lent zest to the weary miles, and cheered him amid
false scents and vexatious delays and doublings,
till at last he had found her.
But Tuarie was not grateful. On the contrary,
she was greatly annoyed. There were no prayers,
no restrictions, and, above all, no Kirkman in
her life now, and she objected to any reminder of
these things. So she drove Ra away with shrill
upbraidings and many missiles, and he who had
counted on a joyous reunion hung miserably about
the pa hoping that she would relent, bearing in-
sult and blows from the swarming youngsters in
the interval.
But on the third day Tuarie, perfectly sober,
struck him with the first article she could lay her
hands on (it happened to be a piece of wood the
thickness of her own magnificent arm), and
chased him with sharp-edged well-aimed stones
far beyond the precincts of the village.
And Ra went, very sullenly and very slowly,
because he was faint from hunger, and sore and
stift from his blows ; but the thought of the garden-
bounded existence now seemed very pleasant and
alluring to the great, weary animal. He struggled
back after many days, a mere framework. There-
after he transferred the affection that had been
Tuarie's to her husband, who welcomed him
back with much meat and with salve for his
aching joints.
Kirkman guessed where the dog had been, and
it pleased him that something of his should have
tried to call Tuarie back—tried to tell her that he
had not meant quite all he said, and that, pro-
vided she returned in a sufficiently religious and
submissive frame of mind, he might yet have the
opportunity to exercise his Christian generosity,
and vaunt himself much in the act.
So the servant, who needed a chaperone even
with such a highly respectable character as Kirk-
man, was allowed a companion, and between
them they held high revel when his back was
turned of a night and pious exhortation called
him away.
Then also Tuarie found, after a while, that the
garden-bounded prospect appealed to her even as
it had done to Ra. The wild Maori blood was
sated for a time, and the waning European mix-
ture demanded civilisation—and decent cooking.
With the perversity of her complex system, the
narrowness of the Kirkman existence seemed
very good, with its unimpeachable respectability
(omitting a few aforementioned lapses from grace)
and the dignity attaching to “ Mrs. Kirkman,”
while to “Tuarie” there attached no dignity at all.
It took her four days, from the time this feeling
first struck her, to make up her mind. By the
end of the fourth day she was thoroughly sick of
the braves and wabines, and held herself rigidly
aloof from them. The fifth day she devoted to
cleansing herself and making her dress as present-
able as hostile circumstances allowed, and in the
night she departed cautiously, looking disgustedly
at the sleeping figures among which she picked
her way to the door of the w'hare, and virtuously
thanking the Lord that she had been preserved from
like shapelessness. She felt her corsets; luckily,
she had kept them, and they gave her a deliciously
respectable thrill, albeit they had rubbed her
cruelly by the third day of her walk.
It took a good many days to reach Auckland,
and it was a tired and draggled Tuarie who
waited for the darkness of late night to cross to
North Shore.
The ferrymen recognised her, and accepted in
silence her shamefaced offer to pay “next time.”
So the last ferryboat for the night carried her
across.
She remembered the night that young Anstey
had found her, and she wondered if Kirkman
had really meant all he said. Then she remem-
bered his former weakness, and laughed. Kirk-
man’s anger grew less dreadful as it grew nearer.
She told herself that she was satisfied to be the
wdfe of a white man now once for all, and she
would once more make him a model spouse. She
had told herself the same thing many times, and
had always found the assurance very satisfying
food.
Kirkman and the two servants were in bed
when she reached the hou«e, and she paused,
regarding its unlit blackness with a little chill of
fear.
Her eyes were used to the gloom, and she dis-
tinguished the trim-kept outlines of the garden
paths. Something big and lumbering w'as coming
down a side track. “Ra ” —she called his name
softly and musically, but the animal took no
notice. She hung back for a moment. Her
dress could make no difference to him. He had
the scent —she could see that by the way he was
moving his head. Nevertheless she called him
coaxinglv, with outspread hands appealing. He
stood motionless a little back from Lhe intersection
of the paths, in uncanny silence and stillness. A
little fear-lump gathered in her throat as she
neared the place, calling softly still under her
breath, “ Ra, Ra, good doggie, good doggie.”
Then she came to the crossing and Ra sprang.
All the shame and indignity of Paikota goading
him into action, he leapt at her, struck her full on
the chest, bore her down to earth, and nuzzled
upward with the instinct of his bloodhound
ancestry for her throat.
Her scream was choked and stifled in the
larynx as his great teeth tore at her windpipe, and
she died without a sound.
Afterwards it was Ra who roused the people of
the house with his hoarse roar of triumph. And
on the path they found It—the wide-flung figure
with its stained and ragged dress and the red
horror of its ripped-out throat —Tuarie, part
Maori, part Chilian, and the rest Portuguese and
l rench Creole. And about the deadness of that
figure there was no doubt whatever.

The Opal Moon.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
FROM Zanzibar to Chagos Isles, and through
the Sunda Seas,
By Flores and the island bays, and past
the Celebes,
Along the dusky Papuan shores, by palm-reach
and lagoon,
The gory pirate chased the ship that held the
Opal Moon.
The priest of Shaddoo round his neck the idol’s
jewel hung,
And ever muttered magic words in some out-
landish tongue !
The captain hailed from Sydney port, the crew
from everywhere;
The Shaddoo priest had gold enough, although
his feet were bare.
’Twas in an ague-shake of fear the priest had
come aboard,
The veins about his temples swelled like knots of
dusky cord ;
“ A thousand pounds in English gold,” he said,
in Portugee,
“ If you can shake yon schooner off’twixt here
and Banda Sea.
“A thousand pounds in English gold—behold,
’tis here in store !
And every man aboard your brig shall have a
hundred more.
A devil follows fast and close, and watches night
and day ;
On,this Shaddoo priest the crows will feast unless
he slips away.
“ This is the heart of an ancient god, and its loss
hath worked us dole ;
Filched by a dog, and stolen twice, and yet again
re-stole.
And I have robbed the thief again—may all his
sons be swine;
The Opal Moon shall deck once more the &had-
doo’s holy shrine ! ”
Yet through the Banda Sea they passed, the
pirate still in chase ;
They sped along the Torres Straits and towards a
' lonely place.
The captain said, “ I know a port where you may
slink away—
I'll drop you in the darkest hour, before the break
o’ day. ”
And so they laid along the seas as fast as ship
could go ;
The patient schooner in their wake still dogged
them, fast or slow ;
‘Si’ll bear to the Louisiades, and in the night
ye'll slip,
And hidden lie among the isles to wait some
trading ship. ”
“Not there,” wailed out the Shaddoo priest,
“ he knows the port too well,
And should he take the Opal Moon my soul shall
Tot in Hell !
But shake him off but for a day, and in some
secret place
Let me ashore, then lead him far upon a fruitless
chase ! ”
And so they sailed by south-and-east, as close the
pirate pressed.
They turned and tacked beneath the moon, and
sailed by north-and-west !
Yet, when the morning sun came up across a
crimson lake,
They saw the schooner dancing still, attendance
in their wake.
“ Now, curse the dog ! ’’ the skipper roared, “ he
■ holds a mystic grip !
Yon bank of fog will serve his case, if ’tis a mortal
ship ! ”
And hard into the fog he steered, and tacked and
bore away ;
And in a weird and winding course they sailed a
night and day.
The compass showed erratic veers, and strange
returns, that night ;
They ran the risks of many shoals, and showed no
spark of light ;
When by the dawm the fog had cleared, still hard
upon their track,
The cursed schooner followed close —the captain
doubled back !
And, fast as sails could take his brig, he fled for
Norfolk Isle ;
Through coral reefs most perilous he led for
many a mile ;
But when another morning broke, the shivering
Shaddoo priest
Beheld the sleuth-hound schooner still but half-a-
miie to east.
For days and nights they fled sou’-west through
driving mist and spray,
And when the sun broke through the fogs they
saw a sandy bay,
With rugged mountains w est and north, the blue
Australian land !
The Shaddoo priest was mad with joy, and seized
the captain's hand.
For out across the crested seas no other craft
appeared ;
The captain cried, “ By God, lie’s done ! ’ and
chuckled in his beard.
“Now, here’s your due, and quick, a boat, and
put me from the side.
’Tis saved, ’tis saved, the Opal Moon,” the priest
of Shaddoo cried.
The captain w'atched the fakir’s boat retreating
towards the strand ;
He saw the beetling bluffs of rock, the level
stretch of sand ;
When, suddenly, from round the cape, a white-
winged schooner drew,
And, swinging swiftly from the point, a-down the
seas it flew.
He saw a gaunt and hideous face that leered
across the bows ;
A claw-like hand that clutched the rail ; a cloth
about the brows ;
The schooner passed, like some fierce bird that
closes on its prey ;
It swooped upon the Shaddoo priest amidst a
cloud of spray.
The grim and sinewy hands stretched down and
seized the fakir’s hair,
And ’twixt the boat and schooner’s side he
dangled in the air ;
There flashed a ray of changeful light, the fakir's
arm outswmng,
As far into the seething waves the Opal Moon he
flung !
The skipper heard the pirate’s curse, and saw his
frenzied eye
As up he drew the writhing priest and raised his
body high.
“Foul food for sharks!” he screamed, and
flung the fakir overside ;
And for a space the blood-tinged waves showed
where the priest had died.
PRIDE.
BERTHA: “ Why, what's the matter , Nell?”
N ELL: “ Auntie died last night.”
BERTHA : “ Thais nothing. My auntie dyes
every week.”
There is a bay near Smoky Cape with ancient
wreckage strewn ;
And in dark waters near thft rocks lies deep the
Opal Moon ;
Its rays come filtering slowly up, and quavering in
the seas,
Like some strange, dim, reflected moon among
the coral trees !
And there's a temple in the West, where mutter-
ing priests abide
And ever curse the looter’s soul with hate un-
satisfied ;
P'or evermore their wooden god his emblem must
repine—
The Opal Moon shall deck no more the Shaddoo
Idol’s shrine !

The Voice of Italy.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
MY sister’s shop, where she sometimes
caught a coin on the wing, so to speak,
was divided from the Chinese laundry
by the thinnest of partitions. Yet must Ah Ket
have his due. He was a decent old Chow, and
his premises, though mouldy-smelling, were as
clean as elbow-grease and brightly-dyed brushes
could make them. And he was quiet. I appre-
ciated that. My occupation, that of a visiting
teacher of music (at wretched rates), makes me
value silence. So Ah Ket suited me. He was a
yellow shadow of a man, and the discreet shuffle
of his footfall, the muffled thud of his iron, acted
as a lullaby to the jaded.
With foreboding I view ed his departure as, bowed
to earth by shapeless bundles done up in sheets,
he left by the back lane. The cause of his mi-
gration w'as a wife —an artless young thing in satin
trousers whose presence called for gaudier sur-
roundings.
The premises were then let as a boot hospital.
The surgeon was Ryan, a man of few words, but
popular. The derelicts and no-accounts gravi-
tated to his place as though by a law of Nature.
They debated politics and the turf, while Ryan
hammered on with calm, and took nails from his
beard with serenity. They sat upon their heels in
perspiring rows, took “ squints ” at his newspaper,
rand criticised bitterly the actions of persons in
authority. Sometimes they bought a penny pair of
laces from Ryan and ‘ ‘ strapped ” the purchase up.
With all these imposi-
tions did Ryan bear until
they fell foul of his re-
ligion. Then he would
drop his size u iron last
into their midst, and so
tactfully effect a clearance.
After that the ejected
would lean frowsy shoul-
ders against our drapery
window, and stare with
unspeculative eyes at the
alleged “ pure wool.”
Ryan, by reason of his
hammer, his hangers-on,
and the yapping of his
dog, was not an ideal
neighbor in a crazy wooden
shell. But worse followed
—the moving in of a
foreigner in the fish and
fruit line proved our
Waterloo.
The number of the
foreigner’s progeny was
beyond tally—all brown
and all bandy. They
were young animals who
huddled to bed o’ nights
in the grimy garments
of the day, who wore
clothes of generous cut
sustained by string, who
crawled beneath our twin
residences (built on piles)
in the early morning, and
there picked up the thread
of last night’s quarrels
and fought them to a
finish. Also they worried
our dog and decoyed our.
cat with loathly baits of
fish.
Some of them were on
the school roll. These,
at the ringing of the
bell, were always found
to have retired to distant
fastnesses beneath the
floor, and had to be,
prodded out by their
father with the stable
fork. Sometimes they got
ahead of him by taking
the fork in with them.
Then their father, choking
with dust and apoplectic
with rush of blood to
the head, was reduced to
language.
“ Hal” he would snarl,
“ come oud before I gif
you a tasde of de rope
end. Must I dake off my
belt?” In pantomime
he removed the only
support of his pants. “ Come oud when you're
tolt, an’ no dam ’umbug.” - '
They answered with, clods and jam-tins, and
came forth only when hunger-driven.
Their disobedience the Italian, attributed tojiis
folly in marrying a “dam colonial woman.”
With rolling eyes, his moustache bristling like a
doormat, he would yank up his slacks and swear
at his luck.
“ In my coun-tree,” he said, “ de yoongsler is
taught civeelity to de parend. ’Ere ” (he shrugged
his shoulders contemptuously) “ Sacrist i! De
ole man is a—a netting. He pay de heel an’ fine
de tucker ; den, when ’e ole, de yoongster keek
eem oud. Si ! An’ de boy back de ’orse ; an’ de
girl—she go to de dog.”
He would wipe a tear from his beady eye and
resume when his emotions were under control.
“ I tell my wi-ive, an’ she laugh an’ say, ‘Who’s
talkin’ ? ’ She tell me to bag de yead. Santos,
dat I leaf Eet-a-lee to slafe fer sech unpreencipled
tr-r-ash. Some day I cut my treat. Igo from
'ere to de dam dog. I ”
Sometimes the children would be belted to
school by Judetta, aged 13. Her education was
long since finished. Judetta had the limbs of a
Hercules, and wore copper-toed boots. These,
judiciously applied, assisted the smaller fry
materially on their way. They invariably re-
turned in an hour or so for divers school
requisites, which the Dago, in his blindness and
his royal contempt for the Education Department,
had failed to supply.
“ Sech a Parleymen’,” he growled, “dat will
pass de Ejucation Ack ! ‘W y don’t you vote ? ’
my wi-ive say, bud I lif' de shoulder so, an’ put
de thumb to de nose so, an’ say ‘To ’ell wit sech
a Parleymen’.’ I vote for no r-rogue an’ plun-
der-err. I keek eem into de blanky r-river. ’E
r-rob my bambino an’ pass de rotten law to
clo’o’ze my beeziness at nighd. Sech a preen-
ciple ! To ’ell with Reed an’ Tommybend ! Dis
is no countree for de man of br-rain of enter-
price. ‘Ere ’e cannot leeve, de blanky ’oloday
knock ’eem oud dead easy.’’
Evenings found him in the wash-house making
macaroni. With his muscular hands he would
knead a murky compound, cut it in strips, and hang
them on wires stretched overhead. Next day he
would cook the heap, and through a mystifying haze
of steam glimpses of his leathery phiz were now
caught, now lost, as, topped by his ribbonless old
hat, he peered into the bubbling cauldron.
When the dish was ready he whistled up his
progeny. From unsuspected holes and corners
they scuttled into view. Into their handleless
cups and battered pannikins he ladled a portion
of the mixture, and thrusting into each little fist a
hunk of fish, yellow and oily, bade them begone.
“ Scappa, Scappa—you leetle blagues. Now
are you satisfie’ ! Clear oud into de yart, ant don'
let me see you no rao’h/'
Placing his own basinful between his knees, he
would then bend low, and, looking steadily into
the bowl, be dead to the world till it was de-
molished.
His elder sons, pure Italians, were fruit and
fish hawkers. Like their father, seven days a
week they labored.
On Sundays they smoked fish, cleaned fish,
fried fish, or burned bad fish.
They sorted dubious fruit and caught rats.
They stacked fruit cases and counted piles of
bags from which myriads of flies rose languidly on
their approach.
Owing, presumably, to stress of business, an
intermittent “ wash ” was also got through on the
Sabbath, and the Italian, with wheedling smiles,
would request the loan of our pegs, our “ doe’s
•prob,” and later, the use of our lines on which to
dry the Dago apparel.
My sister put her foot down here, however.
She said she respected herself too much, let alone
the Almighty, to countenance such doings, and
was not to be wooed from propriety either by
darkling looks or by bribes of dull-eyed trout.
A feud existed 'twixt the fish shop and the
pawnbroker who flanked us on the other side, the
cause being a “ rock,” Dago-thrown, which struck
one of the Chosen.
Mutual recriminations followed. All that day
detachments from either side scaled our fences,
breathing vengeance. I intercepted showers of
missiles that fell short. Strips of decomposed
fish, descending silently as snowflakes, wound
themselves affectionately round me as I wrestled
with the wood.
Our side door and Cohen’s stood cheek-by-jowl
at the end of a narrow passage, accessible from
tire street by a low gate, common to both. Upon
this gate the young Dagos impaled grinning heads
of ’couta, and they bombarded the premises with
apricots, so that bulky females “ putting in” the
blankets, and for reasons of privacy advancing
along the passage to Cohen’s side door, would
slide and sustain fracture.
Naturally they blamed us. . One virago of ter-
rifying aspect stormed our kitchen, and asked if
we w r ere “ drunk or mad, or both,” and if we
called ourselves ladies, and other questions of a
personal character.
The vendetta extended more especially to the
youthful among the Hebrew’s clients.
Lurking on their stomachs beneath the floor of
our residence, where they commanded a view of
the entrance, the Dago brats would warily grab
the ankles of small children bearing flat-irons,
boots, or the enlarged photo of grand-dad. Then,
having pulled client and pledge in shrieking ruins
to the earth, the attacking forces would creep
back to its own domain, then race round to the
front and be ready to further harass the departing
victim in the rear.
I had spent a bad half-hour one morning trying
to instil the rudiments of music into a three-weeks’
pupil, and had been further irritated by the
parents’ surprise that little Melba was not yet
advanced enough to learn a popular pantomime
success.
“ Such a pretty cover too, ain’t it?” my em-
ployer had said, gazing regretfully at the present-
ment of Florence Young as she placed it promi-
nently in the canterbury. “ I thought she'd ’a’
bin able to play an’ sing it at Mrs. ’Orrocks’s
party. She puts on sich airs now ’er girls can
strum a bit; but then they’ve a good teacher who
pushes ’em on. It’s marv’less ’ow they’ve got on,
as I was a-sayin’ ”
Outside the house I paused to compose my
features and to listen derisively to the piano’s tinny
vibrations as my pupil started playing by ear the
song under discussion. So absorbed in the jang-
ling discords was I that I failed to note the
approach of an ice-cream cart.
It stole upon me stealthily from behind. The
ground shot from beneath me, and insult was
added to injury by a torrent of abuse in a foreign
.tongue. My aggressor was a dirty fellow veneered
over with cleanliness. His overalls, as a sop to
public opinion, were of white duck. His cart
was gorgeous in white and gold, and gay ban-
nerets fluttered from every corner. His business
seemed to consist in exchanging icecream for rags,
bones, and other saleable refuse. The goods,
after being pawed over with his hands, were
stowed in the body of his cart.
When I got home my sister met me, wearing a:
worried expression.
“ We shall have to move now,” she said.
“Why, what is it now?” I asked, testily.
“ Haven’t we run the whole gamut yet ?”
“ Now don’t start to rave, tny dear; but the
Fish Shop has taken a boarder. Mr. Giuseppe
introduced him just now. Oh, yes ; a foreign
gentleman —he wants to rent our woodshed, and
positively refuses to lake ‘ No.’ ”
“ Rent the woodshed ! Whatever for ?”
“ Oh, he has a vehicle, I beiieve. He wants
the shed as a stable. I referred him to you ;
he ”
A horrid smell of very old meat suddenly en-
veloped us, and a voice—the voice of the Dago—
was heard in explanation.
“ Hi, mees, are you dere ? I wand to ’ire from
you de wootshet for de izze cream gart till we fine
a bedder localidy for hees beezness —my countree-
man ’ere, ’e spik no Eenglish.” He waved up
something. “ Come ’ere, Antonio, an’ be known
to de ladies who de music teach.”
I looked —and smelt. It was the commercial
traveller in bones and ice-cream who had run
over me an hour earlier.

TOILET PREPARATIONS.
Ferd Mulhens, Cologne.
Purity.
As to the purity of No. 4711 ’ nothing can be more convincing to you than the report of an eminent British scientist,
lanviile H. Sharp, I .C.S.L., who certifies :— -“‘No. 4711’Eaude Cologne is of the best quality and absolutely pure ”
and the same applies to all goods marked “No. 4711.”
& Quality.
The quality of No. 4711 ’ is known to every user of these goods. To the great majority it is recognised and requires
” o _-Fecommendation. ihe few who have not yet tried “ No. 4711 ” will be well advised if we add “ Buy goods marked
No. 4711, and you are buying the very best.
Necessity.
During the trying Australian Summer (which, by-the-bye, is now upon us), you must use some such Toilet Pre-
parations as we instance. So, when buying, why not the very best, which is “No. 4711.”
Face, Toilet and Talcum Powders.
In this respect you will find no difficulty in selecting, as “No.
4711” is recognised as being the correct thing and preferable
to all others.

Unquestionably these are THE Soaps for the Australian market. They are not only cleansing, but soften the skin, which
becomes so hard and dry when exposed to the heat and trying hot winds of Summer.
Three Special Lines in these Soaps are Benzoe Glycerine Soap, in bars of four tablets, at Is, per bar ; Aicla Violet
Glycerine Soap, in bars of three tablets, Is. per bar ; and, also, a daintily-perfumed Rose Glycerine Soap, at Is. (kl. per
large bar. These are the very latest in Soaps for the Australian Summer, and they are meeting with the success they deserve.
Christmas
You need not take one minute to consider what you should send for a Christmas present. Nothing (especially during
the usual trying heat of an Australian Christmas) can be more acceptable than an assortment of “No. 4711 ” Toilet
.Preparations. Your chemist will, if you ask him, make vou a selection, or you can instruct him to make up a parcel
from such a collection as
NAU DE COLOGNE, in all sizes. This line is too well known to need any comment.
EXTRACT COBDIALE. The latest European Perfumes.
EXTRACT DUMIDI, Just now introduced.
WHITE ROSE. One of the sweetest Perfumes on the market.
RHINE VIOLET. A Violet Perfume in every way. Renowned throughout the world.
No.. 4711 TOOTH POWDER and EAU DENTIFRICE are without doubt easily the best preparations for the teeth.
When you ask for these “4711 ” goods, say “ FOUR SEVEN ELEVEN.” Then your chemist will know
that, you re acquainted with the preparations, and he will not then offer you something “just as good.” There
is nothing ‘Must as ffood ” as “ No. 4711.”
Four Seven Eleven
Night in the Great Dead Heart.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
MOON RISE on the Australian Desert.
Time, 2 a. m. A dead-level landscape
of grey, stunted scrub and fetlock-deep
red sand stretches on every hand into infinity
beneath the pale moonrays. A faint track winds
across the face of the silent, moonlit wastes. Let
us stand beside this track for an hour and watch
3000 store bullocks from the North go by on
their march across this 80-mile dry stage. Hist !
Out of the silence of the mighty wastes comes a
low moaning sound as of wind in a forest or of
surges on a rock-bound coast. Borne on the
faint night breeze comes the far-off chime of horse-
bells. A pall of dust hangs heavy over the
northern desert, looking ghastly in the moon’s
grey light. Out of the gloom, along the track,
a horseman approaches like a wraith of the desert.
He leads the way—as lean and tireless as the
hardy bay he rides.
Behind him string “ the plant”—7o head or so
of work-worn horses, some dozen of which are
packed and carry bells a-jingle. Another sun-
and wind-tanned horseman brings up their rear.
These pass into the gloom, heading south.
A space of 80yds. or so, and then comes
the leader of the herd—a great, gaunt,
spar-horned beast, with dust-stained, shaggy
forehead and deep-sunken, tortured eyes. His
massive frame is lean, and the great flanks
are pinched and sunken in. Thirst ! For two
burning days and three parched, restless nights
he has led the famished herd across these wastes
with ever the sound of horse-bells on ahead. His
faith is in those bells. They lead to water. To-
morrow ! Behind him string his fellows. Ones,
twos, three deep, four deep they come. Grim and
gaunt are all ; with tired, sunken eyes and thirst-
pinched flanks they plod with a steady tramp
ever on across the waterless tract.
Reds, whites, roans, magpies, strawberries,
baldies —they come ; and they pass southward
into the night. A multitude pass, and then comes
a shadowy horseman on each wing, and the horse-
men ride like ghosts out on the desert fifty paces
from the marching herd.
These, also, pass into the night, but still they
come—hundreds upon hundreds, in ones, twos,
three deep, four deep, stringing closely on the track,
looking neither to right nor left, but plodding on
with measured stride, their massive horn-crowned
heads nodding to the rhythm of their tread through
the fetlock-deep red sand, and looming mammoth-
like and grey under the ghostly moon. Wreaths
upon wreaths of red-grey dust curl from under the
countless hooves and rise heavily and sullenly on
the still night air, to be finally wafted, slowly
wreathing, far out over the wilderness into in-
finity and nothingness beyond.
Ever and anon, on either side, shadowy horse-
men pass, riding slowly with the herd/ Their
business is to see that no break occurs in the
league-long string of cattle marching south
across the wilderness of scrub and sand. Some-
times horseman calls to horseman through the
night. Sometimes they stand motionless, watch-
ing the herd file by, and presently take
up the weary march again, cheering the cattle
on with calls that only stockmen understand.
Note the vast latent strength depicted by the
march of these dumb, desperate brutes to water.
This is the Desert. The ghostly gloom, the grey-
green scrub, the red-grey sand, the dun-colored
dust curling into the eye of the pallid moon, the
steely gleam of horns, the long, thin stream of
multi-colored hides, the shadowy shapes of
horsemen on the wings, and over all the cloud-
less, star-strewn sky. This is the Desert,
the closing of whose mighty jaws means death.
This is men’s work. Dogged persistence is the
expression written in the sunken, thirst-glazed
eyes of men and beasts. Great, dusty, horn-
crowned heads nod in rhythm to their tramp, and
are lifted ever and anon to answer some low moans
of gnawing thirst that run like murmurs of protest
through the herd, or else these heads are raised
to sniff the faint night air in the hope that it may
bring the long-expected odor of far-off water.
Out of the wilderness and the night they
come—hundreds strong, and the night and
the pitiless, illimitable distances swallow
them. Finally come the tailers —the weak
and the lame. These battle bravely to the
end, knowing full well that delay spells death, and
that the laggard’s bones will bleach beside the
way. They pass. Then two horsemen pass, and
all is lost in gloom. Sound dies. The waning
moon, coldly chaste and clear, mounts zenith-
ward with the coming dawn, and a deathly
silence reigns on the desert wastes once more.
MALLARAPOONIE.
The Idolators.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THE veil was rent, and mundane Time
merged in Eternity ;
And I beheld the End of Things. I heard
the Last Decree
Pronounced on all the World that Is, and Was,
and Is to Be.
Rank upon rank before the Throne the Nations
were arrayed,
And every man since Time began by his own act
was weighed ;
Till, to the Right, the diffident Elected stood dis-
mayed.
For here the lowly Lazarus, and all his kind and
ken—
Repentant knave and serf and slave and
humble beggar-men—
In wonder looked from Damned to Throne, then
on the Damned again.
Gaunt, towsled creatures of the streets still
trembled, half in fear ;
Weak women who had “sinned” for love, and
common folk were here,
Facing the Lost, yet doubting still that the Decree
was clear.
For on the Left amid the Damned, a thousand
million strong,
There stood a band of “ righteous” folk—a very
“ genteel ” throng ;
All much surprised and scandalised, and scenting
“ something wrong.”
Here reigned Respectability ’mid virgins sour and
chaste ;
Prim, haughty dames, whose worldly aims had
been in perfect taste,
Shorn of their pride, stood side by side with
sweaters leaden-faced.
Strict folk, w'ho ne’er had sinned without due
reck’ning of the cost,
Sniffed disapproval and declared the function was
a frost,
And vowed the angel-ushers erred in marking
them as Lost.
Strange men there were of ev'ry age since Man
did first increase,
From Adam on ,to Babylon, from Persia to
Greece,
From Greece and Rome, to England, on till Time
was bidden cease.
Courtiers were there, and prince and peer—ay,
even brewer-knights—
Preachers and parsons, Pharisees, Gentiles and
Israelites,
Pharaohs and Caesars, Emperors and smug sub-
urbanites.
Yea, every canting hypocrite since early Eocene,
In skin and silk and suit of mail and broadcloth
stood serene,
Full sure his plight would be set right when the
“ mistake ” was seen.
And, as they gazed, shocked and amazed, upon
the chosen side—
On folk ill-clad in rags that had half-clothed them
w'hen they died —
“ Lord God, they’re not respectable ! Nay, have a
care ! ” they cried.
Then stepped there forth, consumed with wrath,
an unctuous alderman ;
And, standing out before the Throne, he pomp-
ously began—
(ln life he built a church, and many “ charities ”
he ran) —
“ Most Pligh, the Heavenly Court, and Friends—
I do not wish to blame
Where blame is not deserved ; but I protest it is
a shame
That such a state of things exists ; and I regret I
came.
“ I—/, a pillar of the Church, a famed philan-
thropist,
Who, on a Sabbath went to chapel thrice, and
never missed ;
I, rich, respectable , am down on the ‘ Rejected' list.
“ It is absurd, upon my word, when even Royalty
Is bid make way for yon array of rags and misery !
Ay, even vice, to my surprise, in their soiled
ranks I see !
“ Tispast a jest ; and I protest it is an insult when
That common, motley crew of low, ill-bred, un-
lettered men
Is set on high, while such as I are nerded in this
pen ! ”
And, as he closed, the huddled rows of Damned
caught up the cry ;
From many million “ genteel ” throats a shout
went to the sky :
“Lord God, they're not respectable! Beware,
beware, Most High ! ”
Close on their shout The Voice rang out, and took
them like a flood ;
Till king and khan and alderman and prince of
royal blood,
And chief and lord and preacher cowered and
trembled where they stood.
“ Ye knew my life, ye knew my Law, ye mocked
with hollow praise ;
Ye knelt to me in blasphemy once in the Seven
Days ;
Then raised an idol in my place and went your
idol’s ways.
“ To this ye turned ; for this ye spurned the Man
of Galilee ;
And in your hearts ye sacrificed to other gods
than me ;
Nor ceased to crawl to it ye call ‘ Respectability.’
“And when its Law was not my Law, say,
whither did ye lean ?
Did ye heed my Word or seek to aid my humble
folk and mean ?
Ye prayed unto a myth and scorned the lowly
Nazarene.
“E’en as ye judged my People here, so are ye
judged and weighed ;
But the humble mates of Christ the Carpenter to-
day are paid.
My folk they be ; I know not ye. Go, call your
god to aid.”
And 10, adowm the shining stairs, each with a
flaming sword,
Avenging hosts of angels came—yet howled the
stricken horde,
“ Lord God, they're not respectable ! Be warned
in time , 0 Lord! "
Then yawned agape and greedily a horrid, fiery
cleft,
And prince and king and alderman, of pomp and
pride bereft,
Went, pressed like herded cattle, till no trace of
gloom was left.
Yet, as they fell, the gates of Hell gave back a
cry that came—
Now far and faint, a doleful plaint —all muffled
through the flame,
“ Lord God, they're not respectable! 0, King
of Kings , for shame !"

THE

'pHE illustration at the top
shows a watch made in
the 17th Century. The Illus-
trations at the foot depict
the latest thin model Gold
| Watch, made by the Elgin Wateh Co-
specially fop Stewart Dawson & Co.
What a difference in appearance; one
is big and bulky—the other fits snugly
into the pocket and does not even show
that it is there. The difference in the
works is even more marked. The big
bulky one could never be relied upon to keep any sort of
time-the other is a wateh of unerring accuracy. The case
is of Plain Polished 14-ct. Solid Gold—the works are Keyless
% Plate—jewelled, and fitted with a Compensation Balance
to counteract the effects of sudden changes in temperature.
It is also fitted with a Brequet Hair Spring to prevent
stoppage which might be the result when going in for
violent exercise should the wateh not be so fitted. It is a
perfect wateh—fit for the pocket of any man.

Eureka! Eurek
Eureka!
I have not been looking for the PHILOSO-
PHER’S STONE, but I have by assiduous study
for over THIRTY YEARS delved deep into
NATURE’S vast storehouse, and by practical
experimental research have, step by step, acquired
information of such a practical character that I
am now in a position to treat advanced cases of
baldness with every possibility of success. In-
deed, cases which were thought to be quite beyond
any possibility of success are yielding to my
LATEST DISCOVERIES.
A gentleman writing from Queensland says :
“ Your preparations are doing wonders for my
hair. I had only a thin CROP OF DOWN on
the top of my head; now it is becoming REAL
HAIR, and is growing thick and strong. I wish
you every success in your great work.”
Another gentleman writes from W.A. :—“ I
am one of three brothers. We have all been
bald for years. One of my brothers had heard
so much of your successful treatment of the hair
that he sent for four months’ treatment to give it
a trial. After he had used it for about three
months A NEW CROP of fine, healthy hair
i®pi
glfy-
>*■»

started to grow, and it is now doing well. We
are so satisfied with the result that I want you to
send me four months’ treatment, also four months’
for another brother, and two months’ treatment for
my brother whose hair you have been treating.”
A Mr. Constab (W.A.) writes :—“ My scalp,
which was in a very bad condition, has become
more healthy-looking, and the irritation is all
gone. A splendid crop of THICK, STRONG,
HEALTHY HAIR is now growing on the BALD
PART of my head.”
These Letters and hundreds more can be seen
at my CONSULTING ROOMS. They come to
hand every day except Sunday.
If your hair is falling out badly apply
SPECIAL PARASENE at night and COSMO
LOTION in the morning, and wash the head once
a week with CREOLUS SOAP. Price : Two
months, 12s. 6d. ; four months, 235. 6d. If you
have only down on your bead apply SPECIAL
PARASENE at night, and EXEMO in the

ment, by post, 12s. 6d.; four months’, 235. 6d.

The Coming State of Australasia.
Unequalled in Resources.
Queensland, the great north-eastern State of
the Commonwealth, is an enormous territory
possessing well-nigh inexhaustible resources in its
soils, pasturage, minerals and timber. It is a
country of many climates, with scenery that is un-
equalled elsewhere, and with natural wealth that
has as yet been scarcely tapped. It is simply a
matter of time, and a well-directed stream of immi-
gration will place Queensland in her rightful posi-
tion as the richest State in the Commonwealth
group. This huge country, with an area of between
four hundred and five hundred million acres, and a
coast line of 2000 to 3000 miles, is spread between
latitude 2Sdeg. and 9deg. south, and longitude
1 53^2 deg. and I3Bdeg. east. Thus it embraces
a great variety of climate, from the keen,
bracing air of the Darling Downs in
the South, and the Northern Tablelands that
surround Atherton and Herberton, to the dry,
healthy heat of the West, and the tropical warmth
of the Eastern coastlands. The death rate is only
10 '35 P er 1000, and is one of the lowest in the
world. Compared with the United Kingdom, with
21 per 1000; France, 24; Germany, 31 ; Hungary,
40; Italy, 29; and Sweden, 18 (the world’s
standard death rate), the Northern State is one of
the healthiest places on earth.
The population of Queensland is about 550,000,
or less than one person to the square mile. The
fact that this handful of people is scattered over an
enormously fertile land, capable of supporting a
population of 50,000,000, emphasises the necessity
as well as the advantages of emigration ; the neces-
sity, because, in order to fill up her empty spaces,
Queensland urgently needs population, not only
to develop her resources, but to man her battle-
ranks against the day when she will be called
upon o fight for her existence ; the advantage,
because no other country in the world can offer
such opportunities to the man of ordinary ability.
Queensland is the finest country on earth for the
working man, and if he has brains as- well as
thews and sinews, there is nothing to prevent his
rising to the highest position in the State. Every
facility is now offered by the Queensland Govern-
ment to those who desire to come and settle on
the land. Already the largest number of her
prosperous farmers are men who began with no
capital but their labor. She offers free passages
from the United Kingdom and Europe to agricul-
tural laborers under contract, and to domestic
servants. Any approved immigrant from Europe
and Great Britain can obtain a passage to any
port in Queensland for £5, whilst free passages
are granted to the wives and children of assisted,
nominated and contract emigrants.
The soils of Queensland are largely volcanic,
and naturally vary with the locality. All the
northern and eastern scrub lands are intensely
fertile with volcanic and vegetable mould. Along
the margin and pockets of a great number of
rivers and creeks, in some cases extending over
thousands of acres, the soil is a rich alluvial de-
posit unsurpassed as agricultural land. The
Darling Downs contain 4,000,000 acres of
magnificent black soil, principally decomposed
basalt. The Peak Downs, in Central Queensland,
are every bit as good. Around Mackay, in the
North, are thousands of acres of magnificent sugar
and dairying country. The Atherton and
Evelyn tablelands in the Far North are equal to
any agricultural land in the world. The quality
of the land on the great Western plains is also
very rich. The soil in the Maranoa is
lighter and more suited for wheat growing and
vines. With all her millions of acres of good
agricultural land, and despite the fact that she
can produce every crop found in the markets of
the world, from wheat to cocoa, Queensland has
less than 700,000 acres under cultivation. This
is simply because she has not got the number of
people she should have.
In Southern Queensland the country districts
around Ipswich, Toowoomba, Warwick, Harris-
ville, Boonah, Rosewood, Laidley, Forest Hill
and Gatton are the most thriving farming com-
munities. Maize, lucerne, potatoes and sugar-
cane are the principal products below the range ;
and lucerne, maize, wheat and barley on the Dar-
ling Downs. Dairying is the leading feature of all
these districts. On the Downs and around Roma
most of the wheat grown in Queensland is pro-
duced. Westerly of the Darling Downs the
country is made up of extensive stretches of open
plains, or lightly-timbered country of great rich-
ness. The Maryborough and Bundaberg dis-
trictscontain magnificent land. The Isis Scrub, near
the latter place, is one of the best districts in the
State for sugar growing. Immediately west of
these places the country is mostly pastoral, and
the hills abound in minerals.
In Central Queensland pastoral and mining are
the chief industries, although dairying and farm-
ing are gradually making headway. The great
Mount Morgan mine has alone produced over
,£7,000,000 in dividends and £"14,000,000 in
gold. A railway line connects the port of Rock-
hampton with the Western country. It is 428
miles in length, and terminates at Longreach, in
the centre of magnificent rolling downs, on the
banks of the Thompson River. In common with
all Western Queensland, country to the westward
of the Great Dividing Range is principally flat or
undulating downs, and sparsely timbered. The
greater part of the area is rich soil, on which
grass and nutritious herbage grow in profusion.
So excellent is the grass, especially the Mitchell,
that even in its dry stage it has all the qualities of
hay, and stock keep their condition on it. Arte-
sian bores have been put down in great numbers
over all this country, there being now about
1000 of these. Opals also exist in the Western
?ands.
In North Queensland, there are large areas of
good agricultural land, with sufficient rainfall, de-
voted to the cultivation of sugar, as at Mackay,
Proserpine, Burdekin Delta ; and good land and
copious rainfalls are the characteristics of Herbert
River, Geraldton, Cairns and Port Douglas.
Around Mackay may be found thousands upon
thousands of acres of magnificent dairy lands, ob-
tainable at prices varying from £ I to £3 per acre,
and a rainfall of about 72 inches per annum. Last
year Mackay produced over worth ot
sugar, equalling a producing value of £s°° per
farm. This was the product of 1000 farmers,
fully three-fourths of whom came to the district as
agricultural laborers. A great development is
taking place in the Cairns district, both in the ex-
tensive mineral areas at Chillagoe and in the fine
agricultural country around Atherton. It is a re-
markable fact that on these tablelands behind
Cairns, and in latitude I7deg., in a line
with Normanton on the Gulf, the climate
is cool and bracing, and much resembles that
of the Darling Downs. These lands are from
2000 to 4000 ft. above sea level, splendidly
watered, and untouched by drought. Past Cook-
town the land has not yet been opened up by
agriculturists. Minerals abound in many of the
hUly and broken districts between the coast and
the Great Dividing Range, as gold, copper and
coal near Clermont; and near Ravenswood, gold
and silver. Charters Towers, the premier gold-
field of Queensland, also lies to the westward of
the Coast Range, as do the Cape goldfield, and the
Star River copper and silver mines. The Coast
Range near Ingham carries large tin deposits, and
the ' head of" the Russell River carries gold.
Further north the Ilerberton district is extremely
hilly and broken, and seems to contain neaily all
the more valuable minerals, since gold, copper,
tin, wolfram and molybdenite are found at many
places ; and names such as Herberton, Mount
Garnet, Chillagoe, Thornborough and Watson-
ville are suggestive of mineral wealth. Further
north, amongst the rough conglomerate ridges of
the Palmer, gold exists ; also on the Hamilton
and Coen fields ; whilst westerly the Croydon,
the Etheridge, the Gilbert Goldfields are found
on second-class pastoral country, rough and hilly
in character.
Further west the country is low and undulating,
or flat with ridges, in which copper is found in
great abundance, as at Cloncurry. The railway
has now reached this important mineral centre
and linked it with the port of Townsville.

The Wealth of Queensland.
The sheep in Queensland numbered nearly
.17,000,000 in 1907, and, as the lambings have
been heavy, the total should touch 20,000,000 at
the end of the present year. Cattle numbered
nearly 4,000,000, horses nearly 500,000, and pigs
under 150,000. Out of the whole £7>°345887 of
the output of the grazing industry for 1907, wool
contributed 133, or 59 P er cent., as COllv
pared with £3,388,929 for 1906. With sheep
exported, killed for consumption, etc., this
touches £5,000,000 contributed by sheep and
wool. The dairying industry is expanding
rapidly. In 1901 Queensland produced
9,741,8821 b. of butter ; in 1907 she produced
22,789,1581 b. ; besides nearly 3,000,0001 b. of
cheese, and over i0,000,0001b. of bacon. In 1906
she produced 184,377 tons of sugar, and in 1907
188,307 tons. Her average yield per acre for
wheat was 19 ‘4O bushels in 1901, and for 20
years averaged 1372 bushels per acre. The
maize crop for 1907 returned 3,093,789 bushels,
and hay over 70,000 tons. In 1905 her banana
crop totalled 2,509,268 bunches, but the severe
cyclone in 1906 wrecked the plantations.
Yet in 1907 she pulled up again with 1,502,636
bunches. Queensland is a great fruit-producing
country. She can produce all the cultivated
fruits of the world. Mangoes returned 201,741
bushels last year, and strawberries 221,325 quarts.
Five tons of strawberries have been taken off an
acre in one season. Apples returned 24,132
bushels.
The aggregate area of her mining fields pro-
claimed open is 5 1,011,437 acres. The gold yield for
1907 was 465,88202., valued at £l, I he
value of minerals other than gold was £2,i53> 22 6-
The coal trade is expanding rapidly. The total
value of the years (1907) mineral production was
£4,132,164. The grand total of all minerals
obtained up to the end. of 19°7 was g°W
£66,314,528: other metals, £18,546,939, or
£84,861,467 since settlement first began. Queens-
land possesses an enormous range of useful
timbers. In 1907 she. turned out 91,752,076 ft.
of hardwoods, softwoods and cedar. The total
output of sawn timber for the last 20 years was
1,323,816,120. In 1907 she exported nearly
£3,000,000 agricultural products. Queensland’s
output in manufactures for 1907 was valued at
£11,106,979 —over £2,000,000 more than in 1906.
There were nearly £5,000,000 to credit of the
depositors in the Queensland Savings Bank at the
end of 1907. These depositors numbered 97,995.
Queensland’s revenue for the year ending 30th
June, 1908, was £5,451,632; her expenditure
£5.336,330-
* * * *
What Queensland Can Offer.
The liberal terms under which Crown land Can
be acquired, extending over 20 years, gives the
poorest man an opportunity of acquiring a home.
The first deposit and i-sth survey fee of an agri-
cultural farm at I os. per acre would be only
£3 16s. Blocks not exceeding 160 acres can be
obtained free on certain conditions. Land is not
available for free homestead selection unless
specially so proclaimed. The advent of scientific
dairying, co-operative butter factories, with a
certain market for butter in London, has given a
great stimulus to closer settlement. Fanners can
rely on a regular monthly cream cheque, and this
monthly cream cheque has dotted the country in
the settled districts with comfortable homesteads.
The cream cheque more than pays expenses, and
other crops are clear profit. Hundreds of verified in-
stances could be given of men who are now not only
well-to-do, but wealthy, who began with nothing.
Pamphlets giving this and all other information can
be obtained from the Intelligence Bureau of the
Lands and Tourist Departments of the Queensland
Government. In the sugar districts laborers
can earn 4s. a ton cane-cutting, and can make a big
cheque every season. The industrious section of
these workers soon accumulate sufficient to start
cane-growing on their own account, and become
independent.
The class of small sheep farmers is increasing
daily, and lamb-raising is becoming an important
adjunct to the income of the small settler.
Shearers in Queensland who are experts can
easily earn from £i ios. to £2 a day in fine
weather. Many of these shearers have farms of
their own. Not only does the Government grant
a free railway pass to the intending agricultural
settler desirous of inspecting land, but it also
carries his family, personal effects and furniture
free to the railway station nearest the land.
Special reduced rates are granted for the
carriage of building material and fencing wire.
Wire-netting is also supplied on 20 years’ terms at
5 per cent, interest per annum. If desired, the
State will also sink wells on waterless country,
spreading the cost over the total purchase price
of the land, payable in 20 years. Not only are fresh
areas of good land on 20 years' terms being con-
tinually opened up by the Government, but the
latter also assists the small settler to make a start.
The Agricultural Bank, a Government institu-
tion, makes advances to settlers at 5 per cent, per
annum repayable in 25 years. The applicant for
an advance must give a first mortgage on his
holding. The Bank advances 12s. in the £on
the total value of the land and improvements.
For the first five years only simple interest is
charged at 5 per cent, per annum. After five
years the borrower must begin to redeem his
advance at the rate of £4 os. 3d. half-yearly for
each £lOO borrowed, inclusive of interest, until
the whole is paid.
The Agricultural Bank-will also advance ios.
in the £ of the total value of stock, machinery
.or implements the selector desires to purchase.
This is repayable at the rate of £3 ns. half-
yearly, including interest for each £lOO borrowed
until the whole is paid off.
There is an excellent State Agricultural Col-
lege at Gatlon, where pupils can receive a train-
ing in practical and scientific agriculture at a
nominal charge. There are also State farms in
various parts of the State.
Altogether in no other land can the would-be
settler find easier conditions, or more State
assistance.
As a proof of the attention Queensland is re-
ceiving at present as regards land matters, no
better illustration can be given than the fact that,
upon the arrival of the inter-State shipping com-
panies’ steamers at Brisbane from Southern ports,
crowds of men may be seen at the Inquiry Office
of the Lands Department, all bent upon the one
absorbing object, that is, the acquiring of Queens-
land Crown Lands.
Here may be seen intending selectors from
New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia,
Maoriland, Westralia, Canada and South Africa,
all busily engaged in receiving information and in
scanning plans and lithographic maps showing
the areas thrown open for selection.
The attraction of these people to Queensland is
but the natural sequence of a number of things.
First and foremost is the cheapness of good agri-
cultural and dairying land in the great north-
eastern State, combined with the easy terms and
conditions of selection granted by the Queensland
Government. Then again there is the congested
state of large areas of the better class of land in
the other States, where farmers, desirous of plac-
ing their hardy and practical sons on the land to
make a home for themselves, cannot do so on
account of the prohibitive price of land in their
own districts. These young men, who constitute
the backbone of a nation, and at once become its
greatest asset, are thus attracted to the State.
Many cases could be cited where young men
from the neighboring States have been so success-
ful that, after a few years, it is their ambition to
try to induce their friends to follow the course
that they have themselves pursued.
Land of the class such as in the States of
N. S. W. and Victoria and in Maoriland brings from
£35 to £5O per acre can be obtained in Queens-
land at prices ranging from £2 to £5 per acre.
During the recent display of a branch of the
Queensland Intelligence and Tourist Bureau in
Melbourne, fully 80 per cent, of the inquiries
were in respect of land.
This desire for land on the part of the people is
also evidenced by the fact that each week sees
thousands of acres of new land taken up as agri-
cultural or grazing farms in Queensland. For the
last week in the month of October of the present
year over 57,000 acres of grazing selections alone
were taken up.
As a further proof of the activity in respect of
land matters, there were for the period of the
nine months of the present year no less than
2425 selections taken up under the various
tenures, representing an area of 3,883,313 acres, at
an annual rental of £26,000 to the State ; while
for the same period of the previous year there
were 2047 selections taken up, representing an
area of 3,419,269 acres, at an annual rental of
under £21,000 —thus denoting a healthy increase
all round.
COMPARATIVE STATEMENT
OF
QUEENSLAND CROWN LAND, SELECTED JANUARY I TO
SEPTEMBER 30, 1907 AND 1908.
Last year the area of Queensland Crown Land
selected was the greatest yet recorded, and ex-
ceeded by nearly 30 per cent, the previous highest
record.
The revenue under the different heads of land
selection also was a record one. The area of land
selected during the previous record year was the
result of very large areas being taken up as graz-
ing selections, but the past year has given a
higher total in respect of both purely leasehold
tenures and tenures that are convertible to free-
hold.
Whereas ten years ago the gross area selected
was 3,629,651 acres, last year it ran to 4,711,812
acres. The advance of last year over its pre-
decessor was remarkable ; but, comparing the
two years in agricultural selection, the increase is
40 per cent.
The most potential fact of the attractiveness of
Queensland at the present time lies in the number
of new farms taken up by . selectors from beyond
the borders of the State. The area of land and
the number of selectors for last year were double
that of the previous year.
The numbers and areas of selections made by
such selectors last year under the respective modes
of .selection are as follows :
Number. Area in Acres.
Agricultural Farms .. 395 264,455
Do. Homesteads.. "2 959
Unconditional Selections.. 11 3,192
Prickly Pear Selections .. 17L 229,887
Grazing Farms .. .. 19 82,492
Total .. .. 589 580,985
During last year railway concessions to appli-
cants and selectors were granted to the value of
for fares and /3640 for freights.
The policy of the Government in acquiring
large areas of freehold land in suitable areas, and
in cutting up and having it thrown open for selec-
tion under the easy conditions of the provisions of
“ The Agricultural Lands Purchase Act of 1894 ”
and “ The Closer Settlement Act of 1906,” has
in almost every case been fraught with the greatest
good.
Especially so is this the case with the Land
selected under the above Acts in the West More-
ton and Darling Downs districts of Queensland.
Evidence of the success attending the efforts of
the selectors of the fertile land acquired under
“ The Agricultural Lands Purchase Act of 1894,”
is borne out by the fact that up to the 30th June
last 214 farms representing an area of over 28.000
acres were made freehold, the balance of the pur-
chasing price paid being 145. The majority
of these selectors had still over eight years in
which to pay off the instalments of rent and
survey fees. ,
The recently repurchased Maryvale Estate, in
the Darling Downs district, will be thrown open
for selection early in the new year, under the pro-
visions of “ The Closer Settlement Act of 1906,”
and from inquiries already received there are
indications that the whole- area available will be
readily taken up.
A good amount of useful work has been accom-
plished during the year in improving the public
estate. The most important work was the con-
struction of 2miles of permanent road over the
Eungella Range, thus making available large
areas of timber and agricultural land on the ele-
vated tableland behind Mackay in North Queens-
land. Excellent work has been done in opening
up new roads to fertile areas, in building bridges,
in sinking wells and bores, and in clearing
land preparatory to being thrown open for selec-
tion.
The area of Crown lands affected by last year's
operations is over 75°> 000 acres.
The principle, recently put into practice, of sink-
ing wells for selectors still performing conditions,
and making the repayment an obligation prior to
the issue of the deed, promises to assist materially
in the occupation of new lands.
Settlement during last year in the northern
part of the Moreton District of Southern Queens-
land has been very brisk. The area taken up has
been very satisfactory and the influx of setttlers
gratifyingly large. The advent of new settlers,
who are mostly dairymen, has given a great
impetus to the butter industry, and stock brought
by them from New South Wales and other
States will improve the local herds and be a valu-
able asset to the State. Settlers on the Blackall
Range are losing no time in converting the stand-
ing scrub into dairy farms. Dairying, which is
the principal industry of this district, had a
splendid year, another factory having to be erected
at Caboolture to meet the requirements of the
district.
In the Central District of Queensland there have
been three or four sales of fairly large private pro-
perties to southern buyers, so that there is a fair
sprinkling of southerners throughout the district,
every one of whom is pleased with his prospects.
The activity in land settlement in the Atherton
and Herberton districts was apparent by surveyors
working at high tension throughout the whole of
the year, towards the latter end of which some
34,000 acres were open for selection, and every
acre has found an applicant. J
These two districts, on account of their favor-
able climate and height above sea level, are more
and more coming into favor with people desirous
of settling on the land.
Yet, with all this activity in the matter of land
selection in Queensland, there are millions of acres
of unalienated land still lying dormant and await-
ing the advent of the industrious selector to turn
the resources of its fertile soil to good account in
the development of the primary industries of the
State. To those in search of suitable land there
is no greater scope to satisfy their keenest ambi-
tions than exists in Queensland. Beside Crown
land, there are also many acres of private land
that can be acquired on application to the many
land agencies throughout the State.
The best plan for the bona fide seeker after
land is to go to the great North-Eastern State
of the Commonwealth and see for himself, for
then truly will he be able to say, “I came, I saw,
I selected/’

for the cure of the various weaknesses of men and women which will cure in every case.
Our method of applying Electricity is fast supplanting the use of drugs all over the world.

DRUGS ARE USELESS!
Drugs cannot and will not cure the Nervous Ailments and Weaknesses of Men and
Women, such as Loss of Vigor and Vitality, Rheumatism, Kid-
ney, Liver and Bladder Troubles, Constipation, Stomach
Disorders, etc., etc. Nature never intended a man’s stomach to be the
receptacle for strong drugs, and if you persist in their use it will not be long until
you will be beyond curing ; your stomach will be totally destroyed. Electricity,
when applied by Dr. McLaughlin’S Electric Belt, gives to every part
of the body—as it travels over the nerves —strength and vitality, and quickly
drives out disease, no matter where it is located. When you are weak there is
simply a lack of Electricity in the system—not enough electricity to keep up your
W nerve force—and before you can again be restored to vitality and vigor electricity
must be supplied. Weakness defeats the aim or ambition of man. The weak
man must be made strong before he has the necessary energy and brain power to
succeed. Electricity builds up the shattered nervous system, restores strength and
vitality, makes rich, red blood ; it is the bulwark against which disease must fall. It brings
the sunbeams of happiness and health into a life which has been darkened by weakness. We have thousands of
testimonials to prove all our assertions. Our belt is simple, easy to use and is guaranteed to give a strong current.
It has special attachments for men and women. They are within the reach of all; price £1 and up.
Beware of cheap imitations.

‘ ‘ I was troubled greatly with
pimples on the face and neck,

The Best Argument
to use
when discussing means of raising water
cheaply and quickly is a good, strongly
built windmill, having a large sail area
and a bearing on EACH side of the
windwheel.
The “Steel UJings” Windmill
The Larger the Wheel the better
the result. Above all, avoid the mill
with cogs, back gears and elaborate brakes,
which lower the efficiency enormously.
The Steel Wings Windmill Co,, Ltd.,
BAY ROAD, NORTH SYDNEY,
will supply you with the above-mentioned
argument at a moderate price. Ask Dept.
