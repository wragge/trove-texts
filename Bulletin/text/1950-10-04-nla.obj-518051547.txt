AT the southern end of the Menai
Straits, which separate the island of
Anglesey from the Welsh mainland, is
the ancient county-town of Caernarvon.
Although it stands within half a mile of
the Roman settlement of Segontium,
Caernarvon dates from the Middle Ages,
and was originally surrounded by a
defensive wall. The town has long out-
grown its walls, but it is still dominated
by its castle, which is one of the most
imposing monuments of medieval fortifi-
cation in Britain. It covers an area of
three acres, and the history of this
massive fortress is the history of
Caernarvon.
The first Norman Earl of Chester
invaded Wales at the end of the eleventh
century and established a wooden forti-
fication at Caernarvon. The Normans
were soon driven out, but their castle was
still standing when Edward I invaded
Wales in 1285 and built on its site the
castle which exists today. It was de-
signed as one of a chain of six fortresses
forming military bases for the subjuga-
tion of Wales. Edward I (1272-1307),
who originated such institutions as the
King’s Bench, The Court of the Ex-
chequer and the Court of Common Pleas,
is remembered as the lawyer-king, but he
was also a man of action.
When Llewelyn, self-styled Prince of
Wales, and his brother David attempted
to break away from England Edward I
took immediate action which resulted in
the conquest of Wales and in the deaths
of the two Welsh princes. It was during
this campaign that Edward’s son, the first
Prince of Wales, as the title is now under-
stood, was born at Caernarvon. The
infant was presented to the Welsh people
by the king, who is reputed to have said
“Here is a Prince of Wales who cannot
speak English.”
In 1294 the Welsh, under Madoc ap
Llewelyn, rose in revolt against the Eng-
lish settlers, whom they massacred in the
town, captured and burnt the castle. In
the following year Edward restored order
and repaired the castle. During the Civil
War the castle changed hands three
times, was later used as a prison and
finally dismantled in 1660. Its ancient
sieges forgotten, the castle towers stand
today reflected in the quiet waters of the
harbour.

TWO FROM ARNOLD WALL.
About the only time Arnold Wall really
sounds like himself in A Century of New
Zealand’s Praise (Simpson and Williams
Ltd., Christchurch) —a sequence of 100
sonnets —is in the 101st sonnet added a(
the end in which he apologises for all the
rest;
To all who read this book: “don’t be too
hard! ”
Perpend the contumacy of our rimes,
The dull and prosy nature of our times,
Press not unduly on the harassed bard....
Try; tie a knot in half-an-inch of rope,
Or try to jump in armor, dance in fetters,
Bicycle blindfold down a slippery slope,
Or be yourself in writing formal letters,
Seem at your ease in presence of the Pope,
Then, if you dare, go criticise your betters.
The sonnets were first published in 1912
and are now reprinted in a beautiful little
book, rather like the small Housman
volumes. They contain, with a general
history of New Zealand, various correct
sentiments about the Southern Alps and
the pioneers, appropriate to the present
Canterbury centenary.
Of course there are touches of the real
thing throughout the sonnets, and some-
thing could be said for them as an
exercise in craftsmanship and as bulk in
the poet’s output'; but, except for No.
101, they could have been written by any-
body ; and the poems which truly repre-
sent Arnold Wall’s impish, irreverent and
profoundly humane genius could only
have been written by Arnold Wall. There
is no depth of poetic feeling here and little
of that sparkling lightness in which
Arnold Wall’s depth often manifests
itself; thought, metre and language alike
are hackneyed:
So dawn at last prosperity and peace,
And the whole country, revelling in the
beams
Of new-born day, shakes off the ugly dreams
Of haunted twilight, and the noises cease
Of boisterous useless war. O glad release!
Now Industry goes forth with giant
strides....
So much the reviewer, however reluc-
tant to criticise his betters, must say ; then
turns with a sigh of relief —as Arnold
Wall himself must have done —to his
fragment of autobiography, some 10,000
words, entitled Memoranda, 1869-1898.
T ’ crazy is the world of letters
isn • at a I a beautiful little book. It is
school exercise-book, which,
iii i i very much resembles. It was
'■n teSy , inted in Christchurch at the in-
' :ios , id presumably at the cost of
. Wall’s son, who is in the R.A.F.
But of the wo little books Memoranda is
;■ tore likely to become the
col!e<-tor’s prize.
rst page you find, pickled and
preserved or ever in Arnold Wall’s deep
humorous wonder and delight, one Cap-
tain Boyton who, when the poet was a
very small boy sent from his home in
Ceylon to board in England, gave ex-
hibitions of walking on the water—“l
fancy that what he had was a pair of
small floats fastened under his feet and
the whole affair seems to have been com-
pletely forgotten except by yours truly.”
Then there are thei boys among whom
the poet spent his schooldays. Boys in
general:
One more detail of the dining-room will
close this random chapter. I solemnly
declare that during my eight years of this
sort of feeding-time one little ceremony
was never once omitted. The moment grace
was said and boys sat down the one
nearest to the cruet would seize the pepper-
pot and loosen the top in the perennial
hope that some troy would ruin his soup
with it, and I equally solemnly assert that
never once was any boy caught by this
trick, but hope springs eternal in the boyish
breast.
Boys as individuals:
The only thing I can remember about
one Nicholson is that he swallowed a live
frog for sixpence, and about one Perry
Major that he lost his tie and tried to
replace it with a padlock which he passed
through the collar and shirt, most ingenious,
but failed to win the approval of authority.
And, among such amiable companions,
the poet himself:
A pack of beagles was in action when
we first came to the school and an aniseed
drag was taken by two masters over the
neighboring fields for a few miles, but this
was all given up later and the dogs’ quarters
converted for the use of pets, rabbits,
Belgian hares, white mice and rats, guinea-
pigs and that sort of thing. My own
preference was for the native fauna, and I
kept such things as bats, owls, snakes, moles
and young birds; we were all fairly expert
in the rearing of young crows, rooks,
starlings, thrushes and blackbirds. I
achieved much notoriety by my habit of
carrying snakes about in my pockets, and
the Governor, who ran a School Magazine
and wrote doggerel verses in it, made me
the subject of one of his poems as a
harborer of snakes. These were the harm-
less grass-snakes of Old England, whose
only weapon is a jet of evil-smelling juice
on their first handling, after which they
become quite decent company.
Then there is the companionable in-
formation that the poet “successfully
bunked drill for a whole term without
being discovered” ; which is exactly what
the reviewer also managed to do, long
ago, smoking wicked cigarettes in the
gorse-bushes behind the gymnasium
while more orthodox citizens leapt
horribly over vaulting-horses or hung by
the feet from iron rings in the air. .. .All
good books about boyhood evoke
memories of the reader’s own youth;
ergo, Arnold Wall’s Memoranda is a very
good book.
There is a most memorable description
of (he school cesspool ; and the incredible
German master who, punishing a boy with
“lines,” ordered him to “write the Bible
out twice” ; and the poet’s ingenious de-
vice for squashing rats under the pedals
of the school organ . . . And then, in
Arnold Wall's schoolteaching days, a
headmaster named the Rev. R. Capron—
“physically he was a terrifying spectacle
and must have seemed a perfect ogre to
the small boys. He was a huge man, over
six feet, with a convex waistcoat (he never
took any exercise), a beetroot complexion,
coffee-colored eyes, a rather horribly de-
ficient nostril, and an iron-grey beard at
least 18-inches long ; when working in the
garden he would tie the ends behind the
back.” And, a little later, a school in
Northern Ireland where there was no dis-
cipline and the boys used to get drunk
on liqueurs.
There is a little about Arnold Wall’s
scholastic ability ; how, in a light-hearted
moment, he learned Icelandic. A little
about his early attempts at verse, some
blank-verse tales in the style of “Enoch
Arden” which the poet’s father printed
in his paper in Ceylon—“l wonder what
the Cingalese readers, if any, made of
them.” A little about his university life
in England and Wales before he came to
Canterbury College in New Zealand ; and
a little about his passion for mountaineer-
ing, as the result of which he was once
able to eat, in Wales, an omelet of
raven’s eggs ... a singularly appropriate
dish for a poet; and, perhaps, as good a
source for his poetry as any other fact of
his life revealed in the autobiography.
Except for one or two brief references
to climbing in the Southern Alps the book
stops short before Arnold Wall comes to
New Zealand. It leaves the reader eager
for more.
Bush Songs .
It was a bright idea for Mr. Vance
Palmer and Miss Margaret Sutherland to
combine on the words and music of 13
Old Australian Bush Ballads (Allan and
Co., Melbourne); well-printed, and
harmonised with the utmost simplicity,
so that they may be either sung or played
on the piano, they should become popular
in their own right, and maybe form the
basis of an Australian style in the same
way as, for instance, the American cow-
boy and hillbilly songs have formed an
American style.
In his preface, Mr. Palmer has acknow-
ledged a debt to A. B. Paterson’s Old
Bush Songs, but the question of sources
might have been dealt with in more
detail. Of the 13 songs, five, all marked
“Words Collected by Vance Palmer,”
show only slight variations from Pater-
son’s text; for instance, Paterson’s “Wild
Colonial Boy” was his father’s only hope,
a terror to Australia, and he said “I’ll
fight but not surrender” ; whereas Mr.
Palmer’s was his father’s brightest hope,
a terror to the rich man, and he said “I’ll
fight but / wont surrender”
Mr. Palmer can insert or “restore” the
gibe at the rich man, but to alter the
famous locution “Til fight but not” is
hardly an improvement. Again, “The
Road to Gundagai” has only literal
changes from Paterson’s text, and one
verse knocked out; “The Stockman’s
Last Bed” is as Paterson left it; “Flash
Jack from Gundagai” merely changes the
order of Paterson’s stanzas ; “The Broken
Down Squatter” has “big bugs” for
Paterson’s “bigwigs”—an improvement;
When the big bugs are brought to the
Bankruptcy Court,
What hope for a squatter like me,
and substitutes “hope” for Paterson’s
“chance,” and “Black and gaunt” for
Paterson’s “Perching gaunt.”
On the other hand, “Song of the Free
Selector,” “The Old Keg of Rum” and
“The Overlander” vary considerably
from Paterson’s versions ; and “The Old
Bullock Dray” seems almost another
song (by no means so boisterous). The
remaining pieces are “Ballad of Ben
Hall,” “Ballad of Jack Lefroy,” “Banks
of the Condamine” and “Song of
Ballarat.”
If the sources of the ballads have not
been precisely labelled, we have been
left entirely in the dark about those of
the music, all of which is headed
“Restored by Margaret Sutherland,” a
restoration which has been turned into a
guessing competition by a passage in the
preface:
... .Margaret Sutherland has arranged
music for them, calling upon her own
instinct for appropriate melody when there
was no one who remembered the original
tunes.
Without more precise information the
book loses much of the value it could
have as a piece of Australiana; but
perhaps what is essentially an attractive
book of songs for people to sing does not
need to be also a work of scholarship.
Hunter Riveries.
Mr. Tom Hickey has been telling Mr.
Will Lawson about the early days of
Morpeth, then known as Green Hills, on
the Hunter River; and the result is
Moira of Green Hills (Australasian Pub-
lishing Co.).
Moira is an old-fashioned young Irish
lady. She manages to enjoy life without
transgressing, an alchemy of which Mr.
Lawson is one of the few surviving
magicians. But his men are allowed to
take the downward path, notably a
widower with seven little daughters, for
whom Moira goes to keep house in the
1880’s-—this evil fellow has been dealing
in contraband, including blackmarket
whisky, and it is only by Moira’s loyal
stratagem that the raiding police are
foiled.
The widower is most grateful to Moira,
but her heart, so she thinks, is set upon
the first-mate of the ship Moira came
out on, until. Mr. Lawson, with the aid
of the Bishop of Newcastle, makes her
see the light.
Mr. Lawson does his best to show us
Newcastle as a busy coaling port, and
makes much of the paddle-wheel
Steamers which ran up and down the
Hunter River ; and they do say it is a
lovely green river up Paterson way,
though to one who spent a lot of his
childhood looking at it across the marshes
near the port, or chasing crabs on its
mudbanks, or fishing in its muddy
waters—a good place was just off the
steelworks —it lacks Mr. Lawson’s
enchantments.
Still, Mr. Lawson’s book of horse-and-
buggy days could remind Newcastrians
that they have a city to be written about
—what about Bull's Gardens on a Sun-
day afternoon, or the Lake, that almost
unchronicled paradise, or the old Folly
school, or the new steelworks, or the
fine little old church in Mayfield? Some-
thing should undoubtedly be done about
them ; and, in the meantime, this much
has been done about Mr. Lawson’s
lightly-romantic little novel.
Farewell to Lotus-eating .
Colonel Gerald de Gaury in Arabian
Journey (Harrap) has written an excep-
tionally readable and informative volume
which, like his earlier Arabia Phoenix'
(not to be confounded with Bertram
Thomas’s A rahia Felix), constitutes an in-
valuable record of the primitive Arabia
which is now in progress of dissolution
by commercialism.
De Gaury’s travels in Arabia were
shepherded and facilitated in large part
by the all-powerful Ibn Saud, who
accepted him as a friend. It is under-
standable, therefore, that the Arab is
seen through rose-tinted glasses, at least
in the early chapters. Further on, how-
ever, the author becomes more realistic:
If the bedouin remained in the past a
stranger to the very idea of “progress” it
was because, being indifferent to the ease
and material pleasures produced by civilisa-
tion, he had no wish to change his lot.
The bedouin’s pride assured him that he
embodied the consummate pattern of created
beings: he despised other nations simply
because they were unlike Arabs; and he
believed himself infinitely happier than
civilised man. A plutocracy was inconceiv-
able to him, for in his eyes riches alone
conferred no title to public esteem. To
despise wealth and to live from hand to
mouth on booty captured by his own valor,
after having squandered his patrimony in
lavish hospitality, was the ideal of the
Arabian cavalier. 1 ■
While a few of the living elder Arabs
would be thus truly described, for the
majority the adding of “or by theft”
after “valor” would bring the statement,
nearer the truth. The term “bedouin,”
also, is loosely employed, as it is ob-
viously intended to refer to Arab rather
than Bedawi.
That De Gaury’s journey was free from
many of the trials which would normally
beset less fortunately-placed travellers is
indicated in his description of the first
day out from Riyadh;
The carpeted tents were admirably set
out beneath the hill of Kumait, by the
walled town of Marrat, the first halt, dinner
being punctually at sunset and nothing for-
gotten by the servants in our section of
the camp. The efficiency was all the more
noticeable and gratitude the more marked
because of the apparent chaos which pre-
cedes Arabian moves of this kind.
This freedom from disorder is also
obvious from the fact that the author
does not once mention the use of “Insha
Allah” —the equivalent of our “D.V.” —
among the numerous Arabic phrases
which he quotes. Insha Allah is the
common and exasperating answer to any
request for specific performance.
The itinerary followed by the author
is along the usual trade-routes. Adven-
ture is not to be expected and none is
suggested on the land journey. Near-
wrecks, however, are the normal experi-
ence to all who sail in Arab dhows in
the Red Sea, where there are many sud-
den storms and few harbors. Yet actual
wrecks are markedly infrequent, in spite
of the transfer to Allah of any effort or
responsibility for the safety of the ship
when the weather is not ail it should be.
The off-loading of De Gaury into a
cockle-shell “lifeboat” was probably in-
spired by the embarrassment which would
have been caused by his presence had the
crew decided to swim for the shore and
by the desire to avoid the punishment
which would have been meted out to them
if they had survived and he not.
Arabia is the last country in the world
in which slavery and the auction of
human beings is carried out in the open,
and, here again, the subject is viewed
through rose-tinted glasses. In general,
it is true that slavery in the East is not
so cruel as it was in the West,” but it
must not be forgotten that there is a
sadistic strain in most Arabs, not least
in the puritanical Wahhabis, who claim
much virtue, but possess unnatural vices.
Their interpretation of the charitable in-
junctions of the Prophet is mostly of the
letter and not of the spirit.
While the reviewer considers that these
criticisms should be recorded before this
book becomes a classic “documentary”
on the old ways of Arab life, his appre-
ciation is in no wise lessened either of
its sincerity or of the deep learning it
shows. The author’s English, moreover,
is sheer delight and beauty.
The accounts of the journeys to the
Shatt-al-Arab region of Irak, to the
Tigris and to Southern Cyrenaica do not
call for comment other than that they
maintain the very high standard of the
preceding chapters.
The book ends with a note —all too
short —on the “Tulip Period” of Ottoman
history, which, by effortless prose, re-
vives, in one who knows them, a nostal-
gic longing to return to the wondrous
tulip-clothed valleys and the thyme-
covered hills of Eastern Anatolia.
L. O.
Music’s Handmaid ; Harriet Cohen
(Faber). Revised, with additional
chapters on Debussy, Chopin and
Bartok, this handbook for pianists
especially and musicians generally, first
published in 1936, would be a rare
window into the mind of the executant if
the general concert-goer could under-
stand it; for here Miss Cohen has tried
to set down the understanding and feel-
ing with which a pianist approaches a
piece of music, and then gives bar-by-bar
essays on the playing, individual style,
fingering and expression of pieces by
Byrd, Jeremiah Clarke, Bach, Mozart,
Chopin, Brahms, De Falla, Debussy,
Vaughan Williams, Bartok and Bax. The
Bartok piece is the six “Mikrokosmos ’
dances which he dedicated to her
Schonberg, Bax, Honegger, Milhaud,
Auric, Kodaly, Pizzetti, Hindemith, Mali-
piero, Turina, Vaughan Williams,
Sibelius, Janacek, Villa-Lobos, De Falla,
Shostakovich, have all confided first-
performances to her —and the prefatory
chapters on discords and concords,
idioms and innovations, and on “Tech-
nique the Servant of Emotion,” show how
much profound thought she has given to
the ideas which form the basis of the
new music.

"LABOR" AND DEFENCE.
Jhe attitude of Federal “Labor” on
defence, as declared by Mr. Chifley in a
letter to the Prime Minister, shows
clearly where the party stands and how
deeply it is still in the toils of the Com-
munist-led union-leaders who control the
affairs of the dominating sections of the
A.L.P. State branches.
The policy of “Labor” caucus comes
from the Federal A.L.P. conference and
executive, to which unrepresentative
bodies “Labor” Prime Ministers, on the
last two occasions on which they have
been called on to make a vital decision
on defence policy, have gone cap-m-hand.
The first time was when it became
urgent to send Australian militia troops
to fight beside their American comrades
in the advance against the Japanese. It
was proposed that they should fight in
Borneo, where thousands of young Aus-
tralian p.-0.-w. were suffering torture and
privation, and eventually died, almost to
a man, because rescue came too late.
Mr. Curtin went timidly to a
special conference of the Federal A.L.P.
and put forward a resolution which he
asked them to carry. It was That the
Government be authorised -co add to the
Defence Act” to enable it to send militia-
men as far as Borneo.
Be it added that Mr- Curtin’s resolu-
tion was not treated with much respect.
He had to humble himself abjectly before
he was even allowed to address the con-
ference. Two sff his own Ministers,
Messrs. Cal well and Senator Cameron,
supported the resolution by the ex-
official tradeninion leader of the Com-
munist party, Mr. R. A, King, that
the matter should be sent to the State
AL.P. branches for decision.
The second occasion was at the end of
the war, when Mr. Chifley visited an
A.L.P. Federal conference and, according
to the official report, asked it to tell the
Government what defence policy it
wanted so that it could make its plans.
The upshot was the 1947 plan, which
was so badly lagging in 1949 when the
“Labor” Government was defeated that
it scarcely existed. The ranks of the
militia were empty, the citizen forces had
scarcely a single battalion at anything
near fightable, much less full, strength.
The best officers were drifting out of the
services or running to seed for want of
work to do. Armament was at the lowest
possible level, though Mr. Chifley and
his followers were not perturbed, mainly
because the Communist-led unions which
form the bulk of their support and which
formulate their policy were completely
satisfied.
There could be nothing more illogical
than the supposed main argument of
“Labor” against compulsory service over-
seas. It plays on this subject like a
minstrel on his harp—when one string
gets broken he tries another. First, in the
’thirties before World War 11, the cry
was that an army and a navy were not
necessary at all because Mr. Curtin, at a
cost equal to that of one battleship,
intended to make Australia impregnable
with 300 aeroplanes—yes, three hundred
was the actual number. At the same
time young Australians must “never
again be allowed to die in the quagmire
of Europe,” no matter if Britain, the
guardian of our communications, should
fall and we with her.
When war came the party switched
over. Some sections of it officially were
prepared to support the Second A.1.F.,
but the consensus of opinion in the party
was that Australians should not be sent
overseas.
When, however, the question of train-
ing men for home defence under com-
pulsory service arose the Wards and their
like fought it tooth-and-nail. They and
the whole party also fought against the
building of the Captain Cook Naval
Dock in Sydney, for which they unblush-
ingly took credit later. And when Aus-
tralia was indeed in dire peril in August,
1941, only three months before Pearl
Harbor was attacked. Dr. Evatt asserted
that in issuing his warnings Mr. Menzies
Was merely playing politics, and that there
was no Japanese peril at all.
Four months afterwards “Labor” in
office was clamoring for 25 divisions of
British and American conscripts to
prevent the Japanese landing in Australia,
the only ground on which they had said
previously, and say now, that they are
prepared to allow Australians to fight.
When the Communist-led unions
which form the substance of the N. S.
Wales A.L.P., and the Communist-
dominated trade-union advisory panel
which supervised the “Labor” Prime
Minister’s actions after March, 1943,
were prepared to send Australian com-
pulsory trainees abroad so that they
might take some pressure off the
Russians, “Labor” leadership threw over-
board its opposition to sending compul-
sory trainees overseas. And when
the war was over they reverted to (in
line with the Communists) their old
parrot-cries that conscription was slavery
and that men must be kept at home for
defence but in no circumstances must be
trained for defence, Mr. Chifley adding a
new excuse that all future wars
would be push-button affairs fought with
a few atom-bombs and from rocket-
ranges and therefore calling for little
manpower.
Now Mr, Chifley is prepared to go
further than any other “Labor” ’-ader
has ever gone. He is opposed f / recruit-
ing for volunteer forces members
— voluntarily —pledge thg -iselves to fight
wherever the Government considers it
necessary to fight m order to keep this
country free battle and rapine.
He is, of prepared to see
Britain am 1 the United States send their
conscrir:s to this part of the world, as
of yore, if they decide that Australia
shruld be defended as a base, but there
■-s to be no quid pro quo. Mr. Chifley’s
view, mild beside the views of rabid
humbugs like Messrs. Ward and Haylen,
is that “the ‘Labor’ party does not believe
in sending troops all over the world to
every row that breaks out” —though
neither does the Government. He now
wants “all available strength, physical
and material, used to build the country
rapidly, develop its resources and increase
its population”—which Mr. Chifley and
his party prevented the country from
building in the years between the end of
World War I and World War II by a
selfish policy which set its face sternly
against the importation of even one
tradesman to compete with Australians.
In the present situation his view on
overseas service represents a completely
illogical policy. Mr. Menzies has pointed
out that the members of the Air Force
and the Royal Australian Navy have
always enlisted for service anywhere on
the globe, and the change of condition
in Army enlistment merely brings the
three services, now so closely integrated
in action, into conformity.
“Labor’s” wickedly irresponsible view-
point is not, of course, based on genuine
arguments. It is based, like everything
else which it and the big Communist
unions (which form the party’s main
driving-force) put forward, on a general-
ised plan to prevent any party save
“Labor,” no matter how strongly the
country has shown itself to be behind it,
from being allowed to govern.
Policies which were shouted by Dr.
Evatt to the ends of the earth a year ago
as the core of “Labor’s” ambitions are
now decried in sneering and violent
language. Actions which “Labor”
has to pretend to approve, such
as the suppression of the Communist
party, it defeats by mutilation in the
Senate of “principles” at which it now
professes to be outraged, but which it
has again and again implemented com-
placently over the years. The Senate, the
abolition of which its platform enjoins,
it reshaped as the main weapon of its
unconstitutional plans.
It is no wonder that the Communist
party of Australia is said to be dying on
its stem. Stalin must feel that it is
scarcely worth while to keep it alive
when there exists a native “Labor” party
which is doing for him everything he
could wish to have done to soften-up this
country for the world revolution.
On the attitude of “Labor” at the open-
ing of Parliament last week a double-
dissolution and a general election seem
to be inevitable. The sooner they come
the better in view of the ominous world
position. That the Government obvi-
ously knows this is shown by its proceed-
ings in reintroducing the Banking Bill,
mutilated and delayed in the Senate, on
the ground that the House has failed to
pass it within reasonable time. “Labor”
has, as with defence, accepted the direc-
tion of the A.L.P. executive to continue
to insist on its amendments to the Com-
munist-party Dissolution Bill,
It is clearly time that the electors
were given a chance to remove the
obstructions which prevent the Gpyern-
ment from governing and from getting
on with the work of dealing with domestic
matters, over which, in the dangerous
state of the world, defence, both internal
and external, must take precedence, but
which at the same time are important to
defence.
Pact-hunting.
Whether or not “open diplomacy” has
improved the prospects of lasting peace
among the nations, the spectacle in a
tension-racked world of an Australian
Minister for External Affairs shouting
diplomatic negotiations at the top of his
voice is enough to make the boldest
blench. Formerly, from the Opposition
front-bench, Mr. Percy Spender affected
to regard his predecessor’s performances
in similar strain as a dreadful example.
Now he pays Dr. Evatt the flattering
compliment of trying to outdo him,
Mr. Spender had hardly acclimatised
himself to the air of his Ministerial
office when, like Dr. Evatt before him,
he was off on a world tour to expound
Australia’s foreign policy. Neither of
these holders of the office, whatever
weight it may be given in the chancelleries
of the Great Powers, appears to have
appreciated that a Foreign Minister who
behaves as though he cannot trust his
diplomatic emissaries abroad to speak for
him enhances the standing of neither
them nor himself —to say nothing of the
views desired to be conveyed. Mr.
Spender’s line of talk comes straight out
of Dr. Evatt’s Press-cutting book, and his
elaboration of it is apt to grow woolly
to a degree which must militate against
his purpose. He told reporters, for in-
stance, after his call on President Truman,
that he had “discussed the absence of any
organic body determining global strategy
in which Australia has a part”—language
so confused as to mean nothing except
that Mr. Spender wants to debate some-
thing which he admits to be non-existent.
Later Mr. Spender resumed his house-
tops perch to interpret himself. His idea,
he said, was an alliance with firm military
commitments —still dealing with the non-
existent! —which would include “Aus-
tralia, New Zealand, the Philippines, the
countries of North America and those
bordering on the west coast of South
America, also India, Indonesia and other
countries of south-east Asia.” Leaving
aside a diplomatic crudity here which Paul
Hasluck, M.P., promptly rebuked, the
assumption is that some common interest
animates the foreign policies of India and
Ecuador, and that (by implication) Siam
and Chile might have entry-cards for this
“firm military alliance” but not the
natural fighting-men of Pakistan. Finally,
Mr, Spender boiled the whole thing down
to this; that “any pact to which the
United States is not a party would be
meaningless,” by which he makes clear
that his policy amounts to appealing to
the United States to guarantee peace all
over the Pacific, and ignoring the conse-
quence that the terms of such a pact
would inevitably be dictated by America.
Points would then arise which obviously
Mr. Spender has not considered at all.
Foremost among them is the matter of
Japan’s future.
Mr. Spender was deftly and justly casti-
gated last week by Mr. Hasluck in a
public address at Adelaide University,
some constructive points of which he re-
peated in Parliament in the debate on
Mr, Menzies’ foreign-affairs statement.
The “larrikin strain” which Mr. Hasluck,
as one of Dr. Evatt’s former diplomatic
school at U.N.0., discerned in Dr. Evatt’s
conduct of our foreign policy does not
wear any less objectionable an appear-
ance when Mr. Spender carries on from
where Dr. Evatt left off. Although
the Pacific Pact, said Mr, Hasluck in
Adelaide, had become “almost a pro-
prietary brand in Australia, so that one
runs the risk of disloyalty in disparaging
it,” nevertheless “all the talk about it is
premature and possibly harmful.” He
alluded to Mr. Spender’s catalogue of the
proposed membership as a diplomatic
blunder and mischievous because of
omissions.
A Pacific Pact without the United States
would be just a flimsy paper umbrella for
carrying in a fancy-dress parade; on the
other hand, if American interest is assured,
the pact would be like carrying an umbrella
when you have a sound roof over your head.
I would suggest that without a pact the
United States can already rely on the aid of
those nations whose assistance is most im-
portant to her, and that without a pact the
United States is already committed to the
Pacific.
As for the merits of such a pact in
demonstrating unity or assuring American
support to weak but friendly peoples,
“there are other ways of doing that sort
of thing more simply and equally effec-
tively.” Quite so, especially as those
who must combine are already working
together.
But that, in Mr, Hasluck’s view, is
only the least part Of the error. Besides
being superfluous, the proposal, he says,
is “chancy and dangerous” for two
reasons. One is that it excludes entirely
two Pacific heavyweights, China and
Japan. The other is that, in its diplomatic
implications, it lines up the Pacific coun-
tries on two sides, thereby specifying an
enemy, and tends to drive other States
into that enemy’s orbit.
There may be plenty of signs of an im-
perialistic and expansionist policy in Asia
on the part of the Soviet Union, but I
cannot see any diplomatic [repeat, diplo-
matic] sense in going out of our way to take
action which would formally allot to the
Soviet Union a role in Asia as the backbone
of resistance to Anglo-American policy, or
confirm her in her yet uncompleted attempts
to form her own bloc of Asiatic nations.
The first probable effect would be to
wipe India off Mr. Spender’s list of allies.
With India, China and Japan thus
omitted a Pacific Pact would be useless
for his purpose, if, indeed, it did not fall
to pieces immediately; and Mr. Spender’s
other plan—that of combating Com-
munism through economic help of de-
pressed Asiatic peoples—could not be ex-
pected to survive. “Surely,” says Mr.
Hasluck, “our diplomatic interest is to
keep the situation in Asia fluid and not
to harden it in a division between Russian
and American blocs.”
On the constructive side Mr. Hasluck
shows a grasp rare in Parliament of the
factors which must inevitably govern
Australia’s policy towards her Asiatic
neighbors. There are courage and sound
sense in his argument that “the key to
our policy in the Pacific must be our
future relations with Japan,” and in his
inferential advice to the Minister to leave
aside his fancy-dress parading with “paper
umbrellas” and get down to the job of
formulating for Cabinet (1) a revised Aus-
tralian brief for the coming Japanese
peace settlement, and (2) a survey of the
changed situation in the Indian Ocean
region, where the former guarantees of
security to Australia through British
naval and military power have vanished.
On the Japanese question Mr, Hasluck
makes these incontrovertible points:
The starting-point must be not our bitter-
ness towards the Japanese from the late
war, but our conception of the welfare and
security of Australia.
We cannot ignore the existence of Japan
or deny Japan her national life. The best
we can hope for is to be able to influence
by one means or another Japan’s future
policy. We must make up our minds in
what relationship we should like in future
to stand in respect of Japan.
If the assumption of opposition between
Russia and the Western democracies is cor-
rect, surely we must wish to link Japan with
those who seek to keep the peace and
will work to alleviate the problems of Asia.
If there is to be a Pacific Pact, it would be
to our interest that Japan should be a
member of it.
A Japanese settlement would rightly re-
quire certain assurances against new Japan-
ese aggressive adventures, but if we can
form a picture of the sort of Japan we
should like to see, then our policy should
not be based on hatred because of the past,
but calculated to help in bringing about
the end we desire.
Especially, Mr. Hasluck might have
added, since this is clearly the line of
American policy, and Mr. Spender’s
Pacific Pact will be consummated (if at
all) only on America’s terms.
Mr. Hasluck gives reasons for asserting
that all this Pacific Pact talk proceeds
from thinking of the future in terms of
the dead past—the dead past when
stability in the Indian Ocean seemed
eternal and American commitments for
defence of the Western Pacific were but
conjectural.
For a century the Indian Ocean was the
peaceful ocean. Every gateway to it was
guarded by the strength of Britain. Every
one of those gateways today—the Cape,
Suez, the Persian Gulf, the North-west
Frontier of India, the frontier of Burma,
Singapore—is weaker, and some of them
have been abandoned and no one has taken
up the post
The strength of Russia is much closer
to the Indian Ocean than to the Pacific.
In 1940-41, when Ribbentrop, Molotov and
Matsuoka were allotting spheres of influ-
ence to each other, Molotov defined the
Soviet sphere of influence as located to the
south of the Caucasus towards the Persian
Gulf and comprising India, Afghanistan
and Persia Pressure on the northern
entrances to the Indian Ocean region would
be far more likely to present a direct
threat to vital Australian interests than
would an outbreak of hostilities in the
Pacific.
If there must be some pact, he con-
cludes, let Australia turn herself to the
job of developing harmony among the
States in this adjacent region. “Subject
to the overall objective of close and
friendly co-operation with the U.K. and
U.S.A., I can see no more urgent field
for Australian diplomatic endeavor than
to work for the security of the Indian
Ocean. India and Pakistan among our
immediate neighbors offer better possi-
bilities of our working together for
mutual advantage than any others. If
our diplomacy does not succeed there it
will succeed nowhere.”


PLAIN ENGLISH
The Inflation Disaster.
Australia is confronted with one of the
greatest internal problems in its existence
so far. It is a problem that can be
solved adequately only if the majority of
Australians co-operate willingly and
diligently in its solution. Certain obvious
things have to be done in order to combat
the inflationary boom that is running in
double-harness with our production de-
pression. Other things which need doing
may not be so obvious.
Population is coming to the Common-
wealth at a greater rate than at any time
since Federation. The New Australians
need housing and other living require-
ments. But even before their arrival there
was a sad scarcity of homes and other
things essential to the existing population.
There was a shortage also of electricity-
generating plants, water-supply and trans-
port facilities, and of*many essential raw
materials, especially coal.
With demand so great, the stage is
therefore set for a period of great national
development in Australia. With a com-
monsense industrial attitude, harder work,
proper financial direction and good gov-
ernment this country has an opportunity
to progress by leaps and bounds.
But at present progress is hindered by
trade-union restrictions on production, a
thankless reception of the 40-hour we£k,
an excessive Government bounty-list de-
voted to non-producers, and various other
inflationary factors.
The Communist party is now almost
generally recognised as being deliberately
intent upon wrecking our economy. Even
sections of the “Labor” party are agreed
upon this. But no political party yet
seems to be united in its opinion as to
what other remedies, in addition to ihe
banning of the Communist party, should
be applied in order to stop runaway infla-
tion and increase production per head by a
large amount.
It must be decided —if, in the negative,
ultimately in the Arbitration Court —
whether we can compete with other coun-
tries by still working a 40-hour week. It
is already obvious that a 40-hour week
worked without a higher hourly per-
capita output is completely inadequate.
We have also to decide whether we can
continue to pay social-welfare benefits on
the present scale without productivity at
a greater rate. And also to be decided
is the question of whether Governments
haven’t far too many non-producers on
their payrolls.
Political and sectional issues, of course,
become involved in economic ones, and
that is where great difficulties arise. The
Menzies Government is blocked from
doing many obvious and essential things
by the irresponsible stand of “Labor” in
the Senate. A double-dissolution appears
to offer the only remedy. But certain
financial action is open to the Govern-
ment, and in this category is up-valuation
of the pound.
There are some obvious features about
revaluation. One is that, at present, it
appeals to the public at large and to the
various Chambers of Commerce. An-
other is that it is unpopular with a section
of the land industries and with the manu-
facturing and mining industries. Manu-
facturers fear increased competition from
imports at lower prices; miners would
face lower prices, in Australian mori£y,
for their exports, and landmen would have
the same problem. Employees in these
industries would be affected to some
extent.
On the other hand, revaluation would
encourage imports and tend to defeat the
prevailing economics of scarcity, especi-
ally for things like galvanised-iron and
essential raw materials. It would make
cheaper the importation of plant and
machinery essential to our development
plans. It would tend to check rising costs
both in imports and local manufactures.
There is no question that, at the same
time, up-valuation would administer a
sharp shock to a number of industries.
It would have some indiscriminate reper-
cussions on various employers and em-
ployees, but very few that could not be
surmounted by harder work and greater
general efficiency. Price-control is now
tending to discourage both of these
virtues, since, while it checks excessive
profits, it pardons loafing.
There is little question that Australia
needs a sharp economic shock in order
to bring wage-earners and others back
to a sense of realities. Not nearly enough
coal is being mined and not nearly enough
other work is being done. The indus-
trial community has become languorous in
artificial hothouse conditions.
In an ideal set-up, an increased pro-
ductive trend should precede up-valuation
of the pound. But if producers as a
whole refuse to make the first move, then
it must be made by other authorities.
Clearly we cannot go on as we are with-
out our pound falling to a fraction of
its former value.
Ludwig von Mises, an eminent Euro-
pean economist, has observed that “con-
tinued inflation must finally end in the
crack-up boom, the complete breakdown
of the currency system/’ Comparing de-
flation with inflation he says:
Deflationary policy is costly for the
Treasury and unpopular with the masses.
But inflationary policy is a boon for the
Treasury and very popular with the
ignorant. Practically, the danger of defla-
tion is but slight and the danger of inflation
tremendous.
Australia, with the industrial ball at its
feet, is at the same time confronted with
this tremendous inflationary danger. It is
not a matter to be played with in the
spirit of party politics or sectionalism.
Should a heavy fall in world prices
follow up-valuation of the pound it can
always be restored to its old level with
better effect. And the repatriation of
“hot” money, as well as excessive imports
of non-essentials, could be restricted until
the influence of revaluation on our over-
seas funds was tested.
Those members on the Government side
in Canberra had better make up their
minds quickly in respect to where they
stand on the question of inflation and its
remedies. Those who feel that they have
sectional interests to look after in their
own particular electorates, and are thereby
guided in their policy, are a danger to
the Government and to the country. For
if ever a Government was put into power
with a mandate to do a national job in
a national way it was the Menzies Gov-
ernment. That is something to be re-
membered by the Government itself as
well as by the larrikins in the Opposi-
tion.
Too Little, Too Late.
If the recruiting campaign opened by the
Prime Minister, Mr. Menzies, on October
1 needs any powder behind it, it should
be provided by the ridiculous position in
which Australia has found itself over the
Korean business.
Australia was in an especial position
regarding the war. It was the only nation
outside the United States which had
troops stationed adjacent to the scene
of the conflict when it broke out. They
were as near as any U.S. troops to the
scene of action when the North Koreans
crossed the border. They were in Japan
presumably to meet emergency.
There were, of course, also in Japan
Brian Eaton’s R.A.A.F. headquarters with
its attached 77th Squadron, a companion
squadron having been removed early in
1949. Promptly into action went the
77th, along with the naval ships,
and it has since given a glorious
account of itself in constant operation
during which it lost its gallant leader,
Wing-Commander Spence.
It was certain from the moment war
broke out that we should have to send
ground forces to Korea. Yet the awful
muddle of the enlistment services and the
equally awful limitations of the Defence
Ac|, not to mention the loquacious inert-
jiefs of the Army Minister, have assured
that it took us more than three months
to get a single battalion from a base on
the very fringe of the conflict into the
field. It went forward with the usual
display of Press commotion, leaving Japan
on the day on which General MacArthur
said that the cutting-off of the North
Korean forces in the south of the penin-
sula had sealed the fate of the war.
Lieutenant-General Robertson was re-
ported to have expressed “every confi-
dence in the battalion,” which he de-
scribed as “up to full war strength.” The
report continued:
General Robertson will fly to Korea
tomorrow. He said he would take some
Australian gorgonzola cheese to General
Walker and the other American field-
commanders.
On September 28 it was reported that
the battalion had left Pusan by train for
the battle zone via their assembly-point
at Taegu. They were moving off to join
the well-blooded British brigade just as
the U.S. troops in the north approached
the 38th parallel behind which the North
Korean command had ordered a general
retreat.
It is no wonder that the “S. M. Herald”
correspondent in Tokyo describes its
arrival in Korea as an “anticlimax,”
achieved after a story of mismanagement
and shortage in Japan of “equipment
even for a battalion, ranging from water-
bottles and boots to mosquito-nets, cloth-
ing and field eating-utensils,” together
with a muddle of form-signing and red-
tape and a “shabby behind-the-scenes of
who would be the overall commander of
the British brigade,” of which the British
component had been long in the field. It
was still going on when the last com-
munique left Tokyo, and the atmosphere
of U.S. Eighth Army H.Q. in Korea had
become fragrant with the odor of gor-
gonzola.
All this is the aftermath of the de-
moralisation of the Army under the
Chifley rule and parallels more than one
other incident of World War II when we
were belittled in the eyes of allies by
the muddle, inefficiency and the odd-man-
out attitude of the Australian Administra-
tion.
It should lead to public emphasis
on the need to support the Prime Minister
and Mr. Mcßride in their attempts to
bring some order and efficiency out of
the Army chaos, which is more remini-
scent of proceedings in revolutionary
Guatemala or Haiti than of the Army
of a nation which produced the first and
second Australian Imperial Forces.
"Labor's" Iron-curtain.
Remarkable, all this stuff from Dr.
Evatt again on the anti-Communist bill
about “human rights,” “liberty of
opinion,” “British freedoms” —for the
Communist. But for members of the
“Labor” caucus, those compulsorily
faithful workers in the field for
“human rights,” etcetera, things are quite
different. As the party’s allies, the Com-
munists, teach; the end is everything, the
means to the end must not be criticised.
On the very bill that evokes all this
hypocrisy there are, among the consider-
able section of caucus agreeing with
them, at least eight Victorian members
who have said flatly and in public state-
ments that they want the bill passed as
it is. They are Mr. Calwell (Melbourne),
Mr. Clarey (Bendigo), Mr. Keon (Yarra),
Mr. Cremean (Hoddle), Mr. Andrews
(Darebin), Mr. Mullens (Gellibrand), Mr.
Bird (Batman), Mr. Peters (Burke).
There is also from N.S.W. at least Mr.
Rowley James (Hunter) who thinks the
Communists “ought to be shot.” Six of
the 12 delegates of the Federal A.L.P.
executive were instructed to oppose
further obstruction to the bill. They
were from Victoria, Queensland and
Tasmania. Melbourne Trades Hall has
voted by about three to two for the bill,
and is having a whale of a row with the
A.C.T.U. jellyfish about it.
It reached a stage when “human
rights” and “British freedoms” in this
sphere had to be suppressed if this rising
minority pressure were to be withstood
by the socialisation heads of “the move-
ment” —the Old Bolsheviks, so to speak,
of the 1921 platform, the allies whom
the Communists rely upon to produce
the conditions suitable for “the revolu-
tion.” So their official servant, Mr.
Kennelly, M.L.C., Federal secretary of
the A.L.P. and elections campaign-
director, wrote to his Federal executive
and suggested that freedom of public
speech on this question within the party
should be banned.
Forthwith the secretary of the Victorian
A.L.P. lashed out at Mr. Kennelly, Mr.
Chifley and the menial Melbourne
“Argus” for suggesting and abetting such
a thing. Victorian executive censured
Mr. Kennelly; then the Federal A.L.P.
meeting in Canberra exonerated him.
But the Iron Curtain was rung down
finally by Mr. Chifley, who —when the
Federal executive failed (50-50) to pro-
nounce on- the bill, and the issue was
automatically subjected to its last
recorded decision when the present
emergency was not on the horizon —told
caucus that each and all of them had
got to accept the executive’s direction as
to what they should think and say, and
that there could not even be any objec-
tion to his ruling.
Fares and Votes.
Everybody in N.S.W. is to blame for
the staggering financial losses of the
Government transport services except the
McGirr Government and its transport
administration. That is the only conclu-
sion to be drawn from the latest McGirr
decision to bump up fares and freights
and double the existing penal taxes on
long-distance road-hauliers. The public,
which is to find the increased fares and
freights, is not told of any attempt to
straighten up the transport administra-
tion ; the private road-carriers are coldly
told that the taxes they must pay are to
go into railway revenue as a means of
increasing it; in return for the 6d.-a-ton-
mile tax they get nothing. Yet the rail-
ways are hauling record loads.
It must be very gratifying to the
Communists. Part of their general plan
for the downfall of the Australian
economy is to keep down production,
bump up costs and increase inflation to
the point where the public will break.
The McGirr fare and freight increases
and increased motor taxation and
registration fees will help the Communist
plan enormously.
If the Chifleys aren’t worried by Mc-
Girr’s antics they ought to be. The
Chifleys obviously hope to stall the
Menzies Government’s legislation long
enough to be able to go to the country
on a cost-of-living issue. It’s going to
be mighty hard for Mr. Chifley to per-
suade N. S. Wales, on whom his crowd
would rely for a reversal of the Decem-
ber, 1949, election result, that “Labor”
worries about workers’ living costs when
the McGirr “Labor” Government piles
on costs and taxes as it is doing.
None of the States is happy about the
financial position of Government trans-
port. But none of them —and two of
them have “Labor” Governments —has
made such a mess of transport as the
McGirr Government, and none of them
finds it necessary to penalise the public
to anything like the same extent.
The truth is that transport is but one
aspect of McGirr misgovernment, noticed
because by its nature it hits the public
fair in the-pocket. It is, however, but a
part of the general rot in N.S.W. gov-
ernment that began with the McKells,
multiplied rapidly with the McGirrs and
will continue to get worse until some
fortunate chance sends the whole outfit
packing and gives the sickened electors
another chance.
The Poor Parson.
“C.S.”: Forty years ago “Steele Rudd”
discovered him in the raw outback. Re-
garded with a mixture of sly humor, affec-
tion and admiration by the bush folk, he
rode a bony nag or drove in a broken-
down sulky about his district. Through
mud or flood or dust and drought he
came to the little bush chapels for services,
married the young, baptised the babies,
buried the dead, comforted the grieving,
did what he could for the drunks and
drovers, squatters, farmers, publicans,
mothers, wives and lost dogs. And all for
a miserable wage that kept him and his
family poorly cared for and was fre-
quently drawn upon by deadbeats as well
as deserving people in need of a shilling.
In the cities and large towns the story
has been much the same, and the hard-
ships, though differing from those of the
country, scarcely less. Rich and poor alike
turn to him in those moments of human
tragedy and despair and fear that afflict
us all, and seldom has he failed, though
his own troubles may be abundant and
his family compelled to scrape along as
best it can. For he has never been
adequately paid for his job.
You and I may find refreshment and
relief from workaday worries by getting
drunk or at least having a beer or two,
by a bet on the horses and in other
earthy ways. But not the parson. We
might eat, dance and be merry with the
girls and sometimes be up before the
court for misbehavior. But not the
parson. If a cove insults us or takes us
down we can take it out of his hide. But
not the parson, though no single group
of men is more frequently insulted or
taken down.
As for the parson’s wife, not only has
she to care for the man and the children
and try to feed them and keep them
decently clothed on an income that would
make a navvy sneer ; she has to be always
nice to everybody, preside at church
functions, work for bazaars and high teas
and missions and all the rest of it. If
she wants a cocktail, or a cigarette, or
feels like dancing, or even laughing out
loud, she must suppress these natural
desires because the congregation “would
talk.” She is generally an educated and
sensitive woman, and what she has to
endure from some male and female
wowsers would drive a saint to drink —
the parson’s wife “takes it” and turns a
smile to the world.
To be a parson a man faces the same
years of study as a lawyer, a dentist, an
architect or a doctor ; the same financial
sacrifice is necessary from his family ; but
unlike the others the young divinity
student is a man apart. Away from field
games there is no place for him in the
frivolities of the young, and a standard
of conduct is demanded from him which
few young men could endure. All this
because he feels an inner call to the
service of his fellows, and in that service
he is expected to live on a meagre in-
come and face a life of austerity.
In Sydney the other day an Anglican
Synod decided that a parish rector should
have at least £lO a week, a house to live
in and an allowance to run a car in the
service of his parish. The present aver-
age is about £8 a week —the N.S.W.
basic wage is £7 2s.
There never has been a strike of
parsons, but they ought to consider it.
A community bereft of its clerics—if only
for a few weeks —what time the clerics
shed their canonicals and went driving
trucks or working as barmen or car-
salesmen for £2O a week would shake

the social fabric to its very roots. No-
body could get married, be baptised or
die while the strike was on, and per-
suading the strikers back to work after
they’d tasted the fruits of high wages
would exercise the full intelligence of
Press, Parliament and Pulpit.
The tenner a week is some recognition
of the parson’s right to a “fair living
wage” and might allow him another shirt
or two. As for his wife, she is at least
sure of her reward —in Heaven.
POLITICAL POINTS
The big issue at Canberra over the
weekend was whether to tax or “freeze”
some part of the increase in wool prices
or whether to revalue the pound. The
imminence of the Budget made a decision
particularly pressing. The Country party
appeared to be the snag in the way of
revaluation. Without passing judgment
in advance of developments, the C.P. had
better forget about sectional interests and
rash political promises in a crisis as great
as the one the country now faces.
Those who thought Federal “Labor”
had reached rock-bottom in blind stupidity
and stubborn refusal to face facts when
it reaffirmed its intention of holding out
on the onus-of-proof issue—thereby
giving the Communists more months of
immunity—had to revise their estimates
downwards twice last week: once at the
Chifley proclamation that the party would
not co-operate in the recruiting campaign,
and again when A.L.P. secretary Ken-
nelly announced that “Labor’s” Senate
majority would block any legislation de-
signed to give effect to the C jvernment’s
compulsory-training scheme.
The warped reasoning which elevates
the anti-conscription campaigns of 1916-17
into a “glorious tradition” and regards the
defeat of conscription as the greatest
victory of World War I will no doubt
be able to produce arguments to prove
that this policy is the acme of patriotism,
but it will be rather hard to convince the
Australian people on that point.
Doc. Evatt, that master of wordy war-
fare on many fronts, has already said in
effect that he sees nothing inconsistent
in pledging wholehearted support to
U.N.O. yet refusing to train in advance a
force to make good the pledge. The
Chifley attitude is that
the Labor party does not believe in the
Government sending troops all over the
world to every row that breaks out.
That’s sheer claptrap. No Australian
political party believes in sending troops
“to every row that breaks out.” Our bat-
talion in Korea is there in response to a
request from the United Nations; if
Chifley had the courage of his convictions
he would admit that he doesn’t think it
should be there. Neither do the Com-
munists.
When the Chifley ban on recruiting was
announced “Labor” Premiers in three
States were asked to comment. Premier
Hanlon of Queensland said the decision
was entirely Mr. Chifley’s business ; he
himself would “give encouragement
to young men to join the militia,” Tas-
mania’s Cosgrove promised full support
to the campaign and said that decisions
of Federal caucus were not binding on the
party in his State. These were forthright
answers from men who regard themselves
as bosses in their own house. There was
nothing forthright about the reply the
“Sydney Morning Herald” got from the
third Premier, McGirr said: “I am a
Labor man and support Labor policy,”
Decisions of Federal caucus don’t bind
Cosgrove and Hanlon, but apparently they
bind McGirr.
During the debate on the resubmitted
anti-Red bill, the leader of the Opposition
let himself go on the “onus-of-proof”
clause and almost wept over the spectacle
of somebody or other being required to
prove that he or she wasn’t a Communist.
As for Communists, he had no time for
them, and to prove it told the House —
and the listening public—that they’d
caused trouble in his own electorate, and
his executive had been forced to throw
out anybody who showed the slightest
indication of being a Communist. Where
lay the “onus-pf-proof” when that
happened?
What is the use of Chifley saying
“Labor” is not against the Anti-Red Bill,
and is opposing only technical clauses
which do not interfere with the bill’s pur-
pose? He takes his orders from the
Federal A.L.P, Executive, and at the
weekend the new president of that body,
the ever-wavering Mr, J, A. Ferguson,
celebrated his assuming office thus:
We cannot crush Communism by ban-
ning the party Labor believes in political
tolerance, and will not support the Govern-
ment’s attempt to follow totalitarian
methods.
Last year, when the whole array of
“Labor” leaders was howling about the
Communist treason to Australia in the
coal strike, this was Mr. Ferguson’s atti-
tude as A.L.P. president in N.S.W.:
Now that we have started on the job of
cleaning out the Communists we intend to
fight on to a successful finish. Our efforts
will not be confined to bringing the coal
strike to a successful finish.
All boloney, of course. On behalf of
“Labor” Ferguson now gives them the
green-light to go their hardest.
A few weeks ago the A.C.T.U. execu-
tive was protesting against the action of
the Menzies Government in refusing to
issue passports to Communists wishing to
attend the Warsaw “Peace” congress,
which was to be held in Sheffield ; also
against the refusal to permit an official
of the Red W.F.T.U. to come to Aus-
tralia for the Melbourne “Peoples’ As-
sembly.” If they read the cables last week
they must have noticed that the Attlee
Socialist Government has to some extent
followed the Menzies lead. The British
Prime Minister told the so-called Peace
Committee that application from
foreigners to attend the Sheffield shivoo
would be dealt with “on their merits.”
Of the birds of strange plumage who in-
tended going to Britain (instead of War-
saw) to get the stunt going, Attlee said:
The Government is not prepared in any
event to allow foreigners to come to Britain
for the purpose of organising the congress.
The decision doubtless marks the Socialist
Prime Minister as a brutal Fascist. Re-
action of the sponsors of the “Peace”
racket was to change yet again the venue
of the congress. Prague gets the doubtful
honor.
N. S. Wales “Labor,” while joining in
the general howl against inflation, gives
official sanction to the Sixrhour Day
movement. No doubt Clarrie Martin
will get his Fabian Society to produce a
pamphlet explaining how the production-
shortage can be overcome by chopping
25 per cent, off the 40-hour week.
Mr. Morrie O’Sullivan is, of course, no
longer N. S. Wales Minister for Trans-
port, but if in his new capacity as Minister
for Health he should make any promises
about hospitals it will be quite in order
to remind him that in an election speech
at the Randwick Town Hall on April 28,
1947, he said that within three years it
would be possible to travel from Circular
Quay to Bondi Junction by the new
Eastern Suburbs railway. Three-and-a-
half years later his colleagues still haven’t
plucked up sufficient courage to make a
decision on whether the Rushcutter Bay
Stadium is to come down to make way
for the railway. Latest “decision” is to
pass the buck —three university professors
have been asked to advise on the route.
A telling example of how these com-
modity control-boards get out of hand
has turned up in Victoria, where the State
Egg Board tried to have its inspectors
issued with warrants to search the homes
and properties of poultry-farmers. When
he heard of it, J. C. Woodier, of the
Poultry Farmers’ Protection League,
immediately quizzed the Government and
was told that Crown Law officials had
blocked the Egg Board’s notion. Those
Leghorns and Australorps accustomed to
roosting in their owners’ bedrooms can
now sleep soundly,
Vic. Health Minister Fulton spoke
truth greater perhaps than he realised
when he replied to faint hints that Vic-
toria should run a State lottery by say-
ing that hospitals in N.S.W., which are
supposed to be subsidised by a State
Idttery doing record business, were in
“a bigger muddle” than those in Victoria,
where taxes and charity support them.
Eddie Ward, who five months ago said
of the Anti-Red Bill that it was “the
most odious, objectionable and dangerous
legislation that has ever been introduced
into any Parliament in this country” and
has not changed his mind since, delivered
his customary speech when the bill
came up again last week. The East
Sydney pet said “There is no division
in the ranks of the Labor party.” Let’s
see. Three State executives wanted the bill
passed and three supported the Chifley-
Evatt-Ward stand. In caucus a consider-
able number wanted the Corns banned at
any cost. In the N. S. Wales Parliament
at least three “Labor” men, Tonge, Nott
and Tully, have recently supported the
bill, and Transport Minister Sheahan
gave his support months ago. Two of
the three “Labor” State Premiers are sup-
porting the recruiting campaign against
the wishes of the Chifley-Evatt-Ward
party. If Eddie is right about there being
no division in the ranks then somebody
has been putting on a pretty good act.
McGirr’s message to the Six-Hour Day
committee: “It is my hope that three years
from now a Labor Government will again
be the choice of the people.” What makes
him think he’ll last three years?
Just before he was elected Federal presi-
dent of the A.L.P. Jack Ferguson, in the
course of an address in which he said it
was “a great pity that so many members
of the party are afraid to say they be-
lieve in Socialism,” told his audience:
As custodian of the rules of the N.S.W.
Labor party it will remain my duty, while
I am president, to see that there is no
attempt to water down our policy purely
for methods of political expediency,
What, no Blackburn interpretations?
Alarmed at the “John Henry Austral”
broadcasts sponsored by the Liberal party
the unlamented Chifley “Labor” Govern-
ment, that fearless champion of free
speech for itself and the Communists, last
year banned radio plays of a political
nature. British Labor hasn’t yet gone as
far as that, but some of its members want
it to —a score of ’em have formed a
“Democratic Listening Association” to
keep an ear cocked for anti-Govemment
jokes. They are very foolish. It has
always been a democratic Englishman’s
privilege to laugh at the Government he
put in power. If the privilege is takep
away he’ll darn soon put it out.
South Australia is disturbed by the
McGirr intention to double the road-tax
on long-distance road transport. Sea and
rail transport don’t seem able to handle
all the traffic offering between N.S.W.
and S.A.; road transport, already dear
enough, fills the gap. Meantime, a S.A.
haulier intends to test before the Privy
Council tffe position of these road-taxes
under Section 92 of the Commonwealth
Constitution.
These State Governments are after
every spare deener they can get. The one
in Victoria intends to bung a ss. “road-
tax” on all inland fishing. It’ll be tough
on young Bill Bullswool if he’s caught
trying for yellowbelly in Bealiba Creek
with his gumsucker rod and hasn’t got
his tax-money when the inspector bobs
up. And the Victorian Premier a
Country-party man, too.
At a meeting to celebrate the jubilee
of the British Labor party Prime Minister
Attlee referred to the Soviet menace as
“a new Tsarism, more dangerous than
the old,” and went on to say:
We little thought that a danger to world
peace would come from people who profess
to call themselves Socialists.
We little thought. What an admission!
These forward-looking, omniscient British
Socialists now see towards the end of
1950 what an objective reading of the
writings of Lenin and Stalin could have
taught them 20-odd years ago. Others
were able to read the lesson, but because
the Reds “professed to call themselves
Socialists” Attlee’s Socialists, like
Chifley’s, were prepared to take them on
trust.
P. J. Ken nelly, Federal secretary of
the A.L.P., has been in the limelight lately
through his clash with the Victorian
executive and his announcement of the
party decision to use its Senate majority
to oppose compulsory military training.
So far he has only been proclaiming
facts; it is when he ventures into the
realms of prophecy that even his best
friends shudder. A year ago, when there
was a suggestion that the late Jack
Beasley’s London job might go to
Dedman, Lemmon or Barnard, whose
seats were considered to be in jeopardy,
Kennelly scoffed at the idea and said that
non© of the three could possibly be
beaten. When counting was completed in
Corio, Forrest and Bass it was clear that
he had scored a hat-trick in reverse.
According to a Sydney daily, “Unless
our bumbling civic leaders solve the park-
ing problem immediately, they will per-
manently damage the future commercial
life of the City of Sydney. That is the
opinion of town-planners, engineers and
other experts.” But not, apparently, that
of the Coles chain-store people, who on
the same day paid £130,000 for a city
property after paying £850,000 for an
adjoining one not so long ago.
J. G. Paterson, secretary of the Propa-
ganda Analysis Group, says—“ The
members of the P.A.G. are watching with
great interest the sustained pressure for
more power by economists, professors,
advisers and ambitious bureaucrats in
Canberra.” That’s nothing to skite
about; so is pretty well everybody else.
Extent of the late Chifley Government’s
failure to check inflation with its price-
control regulations is to be judged from
its own brave words when it set out on
its New Order policy—in a White Paper
in 1945 it announced:
There will be a'danger that, in pushing
total expenditure to the level necessary to
maintain full employment, we may from
time to time go too far. People would
then be trying to buy more goods and
services than available resources are capable
of producing when fully employed, so that
the economy would be threatened with the
danger of inflation.
Avoidance of this threat depends on the
skill with which Governments can control
their expenditure policies.
They saw the possibility of inflation, and
they sailed boldly on. Was it the skill or
the policy which failed?

"AND IT'S PRINTED
WITH WIMBLES INKS"
“B. A. Ker”: To see old Charlie rid-
ing his ancient bike along a bumpy track
is to lose all respect for trick-cyclists on
the stage. Owing to the numberless sleeves
inserted under countless holes his tyres
have more protuberances than the hide
of a warthog. His pedals have long
dropped off, but the axles still are in use.
A cotter-pin in one crank is loose, giving
it a Sin. “play”—and Charlie’s left leg a
sort of stutter. But it is the handle-bar
which impresses a stranger. In some long-
forgotten accident the right-hand side was
sheared clean off. Charlie doesn’t seem
to miss it; he rides with calm indifference
like a man riding a one-horned cow. A
short time ago he rode into town with a
strange gadget attached to his mobile
scrapheap. It was a long stick, one end
lashed to the handle-bar, the other pro-
trading to the
side about 3ft.;
at the end was
an ugly snarl of
barbed - wire.
“These tourist
blokes will drive
their cars right
u p alongside
your pedal,” he
explained. “Run
over a man as
soon as look at
him! They wouldn’t lose any sleep over
killing you, but they won’t come within
yards if they think they might scratch
their duco.” For a fortnight the old
chap was highly pleased with his inven-
tion; then one day he came limping in
to town with his front wheel buckled like
a figure-eight. “Them truck-drivers,” he
growled. “They ain’t got no respect for
their duco.”

“Casca”: The relentless search by
Customs officers for smuggled goods, even
to the confiscation in retail shops, must
be puzzling to Chinese smugglers. They
have different rules, especially in South
China, where smuggling is a lucrative and
highly-organised affair. They play the
game like a football match, with Hong
Kong and Canton the two goals. The
touchdown lines are the Customs barriers
on the wharves in each port, and Customs
may only tackle a smuggler on the play-
ing-field between the lines. When they
bring him down the goods are confiscated
and the game must start again. When,
however, the smuggler evades the tackle
and lands the goods beyond the barrier
he is deemed to have scored. The goods
are then openly displayed for sale in
the shops, and any queries by Customs or
civil authorities would be regarded as
gross infringement of the rules, and all
rightminded Chinese would join in
vociferous protest. The rules of the
game would never permit the confisca-
tion of goods in the retail shops of
Canton, nor would the Customs officers
ever recover from the loss of face in-
curred by such grave discourtesy.

“A.L.D.”: An old Queensland identity.
Dr. Alexander Francis, would no doubt
have attributed his fellow-Cantab Jan
Smuts’s brilliance in varied fields to his
late start at schooling. Smuts did not
learn to read or write until he was 12.
Dr. Francis recorded in his autobiography
his belief that schooling should not begin
seriously until 13 or 14. His father, a
prominent Queensland pioneer, shared
that opinion. Both practised what they
preached, with results that were impres-
sive. Dr. Francis’s elder brother won a
scholarship from Brisbane Grammar to
Oxford. The doctor himself was a Cam-
bridge graduate, and was prominent in
the medical world, first in Queensland,
later in London. A. L. Smith, a former
master of Balliol College, Oxford, once
told him that “after 40 years’ teaching
experience he had come to the conclusion
that the less a boy learnt before he was
14 the better, and if he were taught no-
thing it would be better still.” Dr. Francis
held that a growing child’s brain should
not be overtaxed with learning. “There
should be a resting period for the brain,
an idleness which gives time for the de-
velopment of individual characteristics.”

“H.W.M.”: Now that the Royal visit
is “on” again the residents of Armadale
(Vic.) are in a flurry, hoping that their
suburb will again be selected as the point
at which his Majesty will leave the train
to start on the last stage of his journey
to Melbourne, The selection of this
suburb on the occasion of the postponed
visit was the cause of furiously adverse
criticism, but in the meantime some of
the Armadillos cashed in on the proposed
visit. Those with windows and verandas
near the station were besieged with re-
quests for sites from which to view the
Royal arrival; many of the applicants
paid over their money straight away.
However, those who got bitten the hardest
were the photographers, including the
Press, who paid substantial amounts for
roof-spots. Some of them got their
money back, but some didn’t. The opti-
mists round about the station are hoping
for another windfall.

“Fairf”: A Sydney judge recently
questioned the justice of debarring a
person from jury service because of a
conviction sometime in the past. Sixty-
two years ago there were no such restric-
tions, In 1888 a young man died shortly
after imprisonment in Parramatta jail.
The inquest was conducted with a jury
of 12—six free men and six convicts. A
surgeon who served as visiting medical
officer to the prison gave evidence that
death had been caused by kidney disease
and grief. The jury failed to reach a
decision. Taking the individual opinions
of the jurors the coroner found that five
of the free men accepted the medico’s
evidence as truth and opined that no
neglect had occurred. The six prisoners
and the other free man considered that
death was due to diarrhoea and neglect on
the part of the surgeon. Parramatta
“Mercury” felt very strongly about the
matter. “To empanel prisoners as jury-
men/’ the newspaper declared, “is not
only a farce, but a stigma on free men.”
It went on to point out that the spokes-
man for the dissenting seven had served a
sentence of 15 years, had been liberated,
but within a fortnight was back doing
another five years. H© had often
shammed sickness, but had failed to
deceive the medical officer. This attempt
to sheet home a case of neglect was his
method of getting revenge on the medico.
The paper finished with a complaint that
jurors were selected alphabetically:
“Hence they know long before an inquest
whose turn it will be next. They are
thus able to organise any obstruction
they choose.”

“Aestur”: “Binjang’s” method of
warming up in bed on cold nights (B.
13/9/’5O) reminded me of the method
recommended by a correspondent in an
English paper: he coiled a rubber tube
round his feet, placed one end of the tube
in his mouth, and let the warm air from
his exhalations circulate through the tube
and thaw out his frozen toes. He declared
that readers would be surprised to dis-
cover how quickly the bed warmed up,

“Mullum”: New-model cars, particu-
larly those most readily available, may
be all that the makers claim, but they

together; our car holds eight comfort-
ably, and sixteen very comfortably,”

“C.W.D.”: My entry for the youngest-
soldier stakes. Albert Curryer, of
Broken Hill, enlisted in the Ist Battalion
in August, 1914, at the age of 13 years
10 months. He was in the Landing at
Anzac, wounded a few weeks later, and
celebrated his 15th birthday in Sep-
tember, 1915, in Ghezira Palace Hospital.

kissed him good-night. If he was not the
youngest I swear there was no more
gallant gentleman in any army. He was
killed in a fall of earth in a Broken Hill
mine at 27, and the world was a poorer
place for those who were privileged to
lorl
know the wondeilui lad.

“Harold Hardupp”: It was one of
those gloomy days. The dark clouds were
flying low and the flags on the Depart-
ment of Information were flying at half-
mast for Queen Anne. When I turned
into a pub to seek surcease from the
gloom most of the patrons seemed to be
looking at their beer as if it might be
poisoned; but shortly a merry laugh
came from a
corner of the
bar. It began to
spread some
human warmth.
A man told a
story and
laughed hilari-
ously ; others
laughed, too,
but not as
loudly as he did.
People near me
forgot their dark suspicions, drank their
beer and ordered more. The man who
laughed went on from strength to
strength, still providing the biggest laugh
himself, and then the nark arrived. He
was obviously one of the superior brand
of cops. He beckoned to the jovial one,
who went over to him. “What’s this,
Phipps?” demanded the Law. “You
know you are on a bond never to drink
liquor,” “Cripes,” said Phipps mourn-
fully, “don’t you know the missus died
last night? Ain’t a man got a right to
drown his sorrows at a time like that?”

“8.P.”: In Spain a young woman who
has been a sports-mistress for some years
applied for a job as a soccer referee and
was turned down on the ground that a
“woman couldn’t stand the physical
strain.” To which my missus retorts
that she’d like to see any male referee stay
on his feet for as continuous periods as
she does, referee family disputes, make a
quid go as far or —but enough of that.
The real retort came from a Madrid news-
paper, which suggested that the presence
of a woman referee would “reduce the
foul play and language of some players.”
But would it stop the “language” of
women barrackers?

“Hamer” looks back:
September gave me a jubilee; on September
22, 1900, my first short story appeared in The
Bulletin, though previously I had had other
minor contributions; and I remain, I think,
the youngest writer to have so scored. A young
friend had won a prize for a boy’s story in the
“Sydney Mail”; it was the approbation he won,
especially that of a charming girl who is now
a beautifully silverhaired old lady, which dug the
spur of jealousy into my literary flanks. De-
termined to do better and aim for the highest
mark, I sat down in a white-heat of creative
effort and wrote “At .the Crossroads.” With some-
thing like shock as well as astonishment I saw
the yam in the back pages of The Bulletin
about three weeks later. I tried to take my
success nonchalantly as though having a story
accepted was quite in the ordinary course of
events. When the chaps at the office noticed
the red cover on my table I talked to them
about Bully jokes, and added as an after-
thought, “By the way, there’s a story of mine
in this issue.” It became an office sensation. At
lunch-time I took some sandwiches into Wyn-
yard-square and settled down to read the Bully
through, but continually found myself turned to
my own share of it.
That night when my mother commented about
the paper in my hand —which she considered
“smart but vulgar”—l maintained my nonchal-
ance. “As it happens,” I said offhandedly,
“there’s a little thing of mine in it.” My mother
had a grieved, horrified face when she had
read it. If she could have afforded it I think
she would have been glad to buy up the whole
issue and destroy it to save my shame. But
afterwards she became proud. The yam was
certainly a bombshell to my friends. One dear
old lady who had been a kindly literary guide
to me wrote that “the story might have been
written by an old roud of 50 rather than a fresh
boy like yourself,” and fond mammas who pre-
viously had requested me to act as escorts for
their daughters to and from parties decided that

“In N. S. Wales Legislative Assembly Mr. Tonge
(Labor) said that zoos should be abolished.”
In Sydney legislature, Labor member called
Tonge,
He tell Australian people these zoos is all
wrong;
Our friends the animals, he say, it’s time they
get their rights,
Shown off all day like models without
bathing-suits or tights.
“Bonga, bonga, bonga,
Get them out of that Taronga,
They’re just rarin’ to go;
Tunkle, tonkle, tinkle,
From the jumbo to the winkle
They are full of woe;
It’s an iron-gate, police-State, concentration
camp.
It’s a tryin’ iron Zion
Where they all get cramp.”
Puma hear the rumor, and the monk, say “You
beaut!
Send message by pipe-lion for the mob to
revolute;
We not a lot of Commos, that plain for all to
see,
We’re just a subject people, aspiring to be free:
“Jibber, jabber, jabor,
Let’s get out and vote for Labor
On the basic wage;
Every lonely monk.’ll

When he leaves his cage;
We’ll get good lurks, no work, plenty perks,
six hours a day;
We’ll be soon in on the union,
Then we’ll be O.K.”
But lion, he been thinkin’, he say “What we

Look at cost of transport, and look at cost of
meat!

“Mister Tinga-Tonga,
We don’t want to leave Taronga,
Oh no, no, no; no, no;
We’d rather do the samba
With a dear old coal-black mamba —
We refuse to go.
We got free food, free sheds, free beds,
don’t pay no fare;
You can tell the Four Freedoms
We just don’t care!”

“Bo”: To suggestions made by a
writer in my afternoon rag that the
majority of Sydney men now go hatless
the hat-manufacturers came back full of
light with the claim that they are selling
more cadies than ever. Had not severe
wind- and water-erosion played havoc
with my skull-scrub I would undoubtedly
be of the lidless tribe. As it is, I wear
one purely to keep my sparse locks from
becoming the vagrant sport of cyclones
and to prevent the apex of my nut from
resembling a west o’ Bourke claypan in
a February scorcher. For this is my
protest against the felt hat—if it gets out
of the original shape given it by the
cunning hand of my hatter I can never
restore it unaided to its pristine contours.
That fellow is a wizard. Taking the new
amorphous object, he whips two fingers
ground the crown, takes the front top of
the brim and delicately balances it so
“Go in? Don't he silly—I paid six guineas for it!”
that the hat’s weight makes it fall just
so far that it imparts the most correct
of snap-brims, then invites me to don it.
I regard it in amazement and delight, for
I almost look like one of those advertise-
ments in the papers—at a swift glance.
Then I park it on the vacant seat in the
train and some goat sits on it. I punch
it out and endeavor to capture the
hatter’s deft touch. The thing looks like
something Weary Willie might wear.
Greatly daring, I took one back once,
but before doing his artistic act the hatter
bent on me such a look of pity that since
then, after accidents, I just bash it back
on and hope for the best.

“Zwig”: “Cryla” (B. 20/9/’5O) was
surprised to find in his letter-box an invi-
tation to take shares in a Hobart “consul-
tation.” I’m afraid he is pulling his own
leg in trying to foist the blame on the
woman he occasionally phones on Satur-
day afternoon for a couple of bob each
way. Let me refresh his memory. Per-
haps 12 months ago he bought a sixpenny
stamp, attached it to an entry for a
“Jumbled Words” or similar competition
and sat back to hope for the best. He
didn’t win anything, but at least he
qualified for inclusion in one of the many
“sucker lists” which were compiled from
tens of thousands of entries like his own.
The particular sucker (“guided promo-
tion”) list on which “Cryla’s” name
appears found its way down to Hobart
—for a consideration, naturally—and a
little book of share-tickets found its way
back to “Cryla.” A nice new racket?
No, as old as suckers.

“Clooter”: At a mountain guest-house
it became apparent that something was
developing between a middle-aged chap
and a not-so-young golf associate. In-
evitably his wife became suspicious, and
there was a commotion of some sort in
their room when she discovered that he
had arranged to take the “other woman”
off next day to play golf at a distant
course. That night two of us came back
from the pictures in time to see a shadowy
form smuggling a golf-bag into a car in
the garage; we inquired and learned
enough to realise that the chap was pre-
paring for an early start in the morning.
But it didn’t come off. He put his upper
and lower dentures in a glass of water
when he went to bed. They were missing
in the morning, and his wife slept on
blissfully, with the hint of a triumphant
smile on her face.

“T.McN.”: They seem to get some of
their terms mixed on these radio “quiz”
sessions. Was listening to one the other
night in which the contestant chose history
and was asked the name of the mountain-
chain running down the east Australian
coast. The next contestant chose geo-
graphy, and was asked to identify two
tunes which turned out to be “Yankee
Doodle Dandy” and “California, Here I
Come.” He failed, poor cove, doubtless
not having a mind elastic enough to see
that the geographic home of the com-
posers was the probable link.
* * * *
“Tox”: The old English military long-
bow was a great weapon in its day, but,
despite tradition, it wasn’t the best weapon
of its type; that distinction belongs to
the little composite bow as used by the
Eastern warriors of the day. Its founda-
tion was a thin slip of maple-wood; on
this, to take the compression stress set
up when the bow was drawn, was glued
two strips of buffalo-horn. On the other
side of the stave, to take the tension stress
was layer upon layer of animal sinew
set in glue. Being little more than 3ft.
in length, these tiny but deadly weapons
could be used by cavalry—a thing im-
possible with the longbow, which was
six and a half feet long. They were
equally handy when used by infantry.
Their power was amazing; they could
cast an arrow much farther than any
longbow. The all-time champion appears
to be a Turk, Toz Koporan, who is
credited with having shot an arrow 830
yards. Bows of the same type enabled
GLAJ)lftT<cnß,
“ He's just one of those common wrestlers, girls.”
Genghis Khan to make his conquests.
Today, using similar bows, but with a
modern plastic taking the place of the
buffalo-horn and fibreglass backing in
place of the layers of sinews, modern
archery enthusiasts are gradually catching
up on Toz Koporan’s old record. The
present record is held by an Australian,
Dr. Boorman, of Cessnock (N.S.W.), with
a shot of well over 600 yards. The bow
he used had a drawing weight of 651 b.,
which makes the Turkish records of
several centuries ago seem quite credible,
as some of the bows used by those old-
time champs had a drawing weight of
nearly double that. The really astonish-
ing thing is that when a Turkish champion
drew one of these super-heavy bows all
the strain was taken by a metal or ivory
ring worn on the thumb ; the string lay
behind this ring until it was loosed by
a slight movement of the forefinger of
the same hand.

“Chevroford”: Showtime Melbourne,
as usual, has become the Mecca of crooks,
confidence-men and Uncles from Fiji, and
the police have taken the customary pre-
caution of warning sundry members of
the light-fingered profession to make
themselves as inconspicuous as possible
for the duration, or else. The trouble is
that, like bacteria in the body, they con-
stantly change their methods. A few
years ago a suburbanite out in his jalopy
on Show Day had a breakdown and was
promptly offered assistance by three well-
dressed Samaritans in a handsome post-
war model. While two of them got his
machine purring the third engaged him
in conversation, and a series of coinci-
dences revealed that he and his new friend
not only lived in the same suburb, but
the same street. The remarkable thing
was that they had never run up against
one another. “My number’s forty-nine,”
the gent said. “What’s yours?” “Mine’s
sixty,” said the other. When the jalopy-
owner got home he found that his house
had been burgled.

“Pat Ater”: Add one more to
“Sackville’s” list of gadgets fashioned out
of cattle-horn (B. 30/8/’5O). In
olden days when shoes were more the
exception than the rule —boots were the
fashion —it was easy enough to go into
a cobbler’s and buy a real “shoehorn,”
carved and polished into a work of art,
with the “color” concentrated at the
base. I bought one of these from its
proud maker in a Sydney outer-suburb
over 20 years ago for a couple of bob.
It was a job that caressed your foot and
gently insinuated it into its shoe with the
ease of a seasoned salesman. I lost it
in a railway carriage and had to buy a
plastic horror to replace it. Only then
did the significance of the word “horn”
in its name impress me. Fancy selling
as “horns” straight-backed chromium-
steel shafts and plastics which tear your
socks and buckle shoebacks! Why, the
balance and precision of that old piece of
a tradesman’s pride are not surpassed
in a modern lathe.
“Sixenate”: A Sydney suburban
dentist who in the long ago was charged
with “infamous conduct in a professional
sense” in associating himself with an
advertising dental company, but was
exonerated, was distressed at discovering
that rumors about him were being spread
in the district. When he got possession of
an anonymous letter sent to one of his
patients in which the bare fact that he
had once been charged with “infamous
conduct” was put in printed characters,
he sued the woman he suspected of send-
ing it. In court she denied authorship,
declaring that she was prepared to make
an oath that she was not responsible ; but
she obligingly agreed to write a sentence,
no doubt fully confident that her hand-
writing could not be matched with the
printed words. It was her undoing. What
she actually wrote was “a charge of
inflamus conduct” —and that was how it
was expressed in the printed missive.
* * * *
“Qui”: It happened several years ago
at a Sydney suburban school. The
Minister for Education had been invited
to an exhibition of work, and an hour
before he was due to arrive his secretary
telephoned “The Minister wishes to plant
a tree.” A splutter of protest from the
headmaster. “This is no time of the year
to plant trees,” he grumbled. “Anyhow,
where can I get
a tree? Besides,
it’s raining.”
There was only
one way out,
and the head
took it. Two
boys were sent
out to dig up a
puny shrub
which had been
planted in the
playground the
year before. This the Minister, with be-
coming ceremony and dignity, set back
in the hole it came from; he smiled at
the photographer while he graciously
patted the earth, and left yet another
memorial of his term of office. I’m not
mentioning names, but an exhibition of
work offers a man no real opportunity
to lay a foundation-stone.

“Sack”: These daily columnists amaze
me with the speed with which they get
on to things. Thirty-odd years ago I saw
Fox, the snake-charmer, at La Perouse
(N.S.W.). After an interesting lecturette
and display of his various reptiles the
showman took up a collection, and the
takings were placed in a sugarbag that
held a couple of snakes. Poor Fox died in
India from snakebite, but the tradition
of La Perouse was carried on. Why
snake-charmers should single out this
resort I could never understand ; it seems
never to be without a man with a bag of
wriggling death. And every exhibitor
puts his takings in a sugarbag with a
snake. Six weeks ago I watched the
current charmer. Before coming to the
grand finale —three interesting specimens
of tiger-snake ; interesting because they
demonstrated the three distinct body-
colorings: one yellow, one dark-brown
and the other between a brown and
bronze-green —the exhibitor passed round
the hat. The collected coins were placed
in the inevitable sugarbag that held the
inevitable black-snake. Last week a
Sydney columnist wrote about it as some-
thing humorously new !
REVISION IN VALUES.
“A hair-do is an essential feature of a woman’s
life, said Mr. Justice Cantor in the N.S.W. Industrial
Commission, during a hearing on hairdressers’ hours.”
The caveman in need of a wife
Selected a club as persuader
(So much more convincing,
He found, than a mincing
Approach to defiant evader).
He bounced it, just once, off her dome—
’Twas all that was usually needed.
Not yet the caresses;
A fistful of tresses
He grabbed, and then cavewards proceeded.
If that he-man with hair on his chest,
And biceps of fearful inflation,
Had had less of rapture
In making his capture
And more of a cool observation,
He undoubtedly would have observed
As she clawed at him there (if she’d dared do
In pretended insurgency),
’Gainst such emergency
She’d have been sporting a hair-do.
Eve has ever regarded, since then,
As something no less than a duty
(Combined with some pleasure)
To spend lots of leisure
Pursuing tonsorial beauty.
Her faith in its potency has
Become what amounts to a passion;
Blonde, brunette, or “carrot” —
From mansion or garret —
Their fibre must be in the fashion.
To stewing in chairs by the hour
Their top-knots intensively baking,
With movements restricted,
They all are addicted;
That sacrifice gladly they’re making.
For, lo! when the doover’s removed,
And restored is their cerebral motion,
The “perm” will, they’re hoping,
Be evenly sloping
Like sand-ripples left by the ocean.
It was Byron, I fancy, who said
That, for woman, love was her existence.
Tis false. Get your bet set
On “ ’lectric” and “wet-set”
Or similar beauty-assistance.
By judicial announcement these are
As features for dames quite essential;
What the brutes, though, who’re paying
For these may be saying
Of this must be quite confidential.

ABORIGINALITIES
“Old-timer”: The hands awoke one
night to hear a gale roaring outside, the
hut creaking from its force and a loose
sheet of iron banging and screaming on
the sou’-west corner of the roof. In the
doorway stood the boss, hurricane-lamp
in hand, and the wind rushed in around
him and blew papers, blankets, hats and
stray gear in all directions. “Couple o’
you blokes get up an’ gimme a hand t’
tie down the old windmill,” he howled.
“She’s broke loose an’ floggin’ herself t’
bits.” Big Fleming and Little Curl got
out and reached for their pants and boots
as the boss backed out into the shrieking
night. Fleming and Curl cursed the wind
and the old mill and surged forth, and
the rest of us hunkered down and listened
to the gale. Then the door burst open
and Curl and about four tons of wind

“ S-s-sh! A Little softer! We'll never get him off this Way."
rushed in and we heard a howl, “Come
on, you blokes. The ruddy mill tower’s
gone an’ the boss with it!” We tore
into pants and boots and out into the
night, leaning on the wind and feeling
sand bite our hands and faces. When we
battled to the scene we found Fleming,
who gasped, “The flamin’ thing broke up
an’ went in all directions just as me and
Curl got here, God knows where the
boss is; he’d be up on the tower tryin’
t’ get a holt on her when she went.” We
went round in widening circles in the
howling dark, falling over bits of wind-
mill and timber and wire, getting up and
falling down again, colliding with each
other, calling and yelling. No boss.
Pocketknife went up to the homestead to
break the news. Then he came back.
“The ol’ blankard,” he said, “is sittin’ up
there drinkin’ tea. Says he heard her
goin’ after he left the hut an’ reckoned
we’d see it, too.” Not till we got back
to the hut and barricaded the door did
anyone speak; then Fleming let out one
single word —but you’ll have to guess
what it was.
* * * *
“Tarbush”: The new-hand wore a
tight, peacock-blue shirt, laced up the
front and studded with pearl buttons. He
also sported “cowboy” boots and a
guitar. But, considering the labor
shortage, the boss, after dumping him at
the Channels hut, took the overseer for
a walk up to the yards. “Now listen,
Charlie,” he pleaded. “Try to keep him
on. The flies are bad an’ we can’t get
hands —yes, yes, I know he plays the
guitar; but kid him it’d be more
romantic if he goes across the flamin’
watercourse after tea an’ plays there on
the open range
under the blanky
stars.” A week
later the new
bloke rode into
the homestead,
and after the boss
had written out
his cheque he
jumped into the
buckboard and
roared out to the
Channels looking
for blood. “Now
listen to me! ” he started on the pannikin.
“Did y’ do what I told y’?” “Yair, he
useter sit over there on the flamin’ rock
ev’ry night.” “But what in the”
“Well, y’ see, the watercourse is lousy
with snakes.” “Now, don’t start telling
me that he attracted the snakes, Charlie.”
“Attracted be damned!” snorted the
pannikin. “The blasted things started t’
come in t’ the hut t’ get away from him,
an’ ol’ Tom smashed his flamin’ guitar t’
stop ’em.”
* * * *
“Carver”: Tourists who have visited
S.A.’s Flinders Ranges in the spring never
fail to burble about the wonderful “red
hops in Parachilna Gorge.” The joke is
that the plant referred to is a European
dock ( Rumex ) which, escaping from a
station garden, has established itself over
thousands of square miles of S.A., the
southern Territory and eastern W.A. It
is an annual with large, juicy, heart-
shaped leaves and scarlet seed-capsules,
The real native hop is a Dodoncea, a
woody shrub whose seed-capsules the
early settlers are reputed to have used
as hops. But although there are gullies
and gorges in the ranges fairly ablaze
with fine Dodoncea colonies, the tourist
is struck by the red dock in one mountain
pass. Considering the steady stream of
sightseers, it’s almost certain that in a
few years a foreign dock will have
usurped the name given since early days
to a fine Australian plant-group.

“Eurimburra”: With the trout season
just around the corner I’ve just received
Bill’s letter, but, regretfully, have had to
decline his offer. The invitation, how-
ever, took me back 20 years. Location:
The head of the Queanbeyan, one hot,
sultry summer evening just on darkness.
The water was smooth except at the end
of the hole, where it crumpled into inter-
mittent ripples of silver and gold—an
ideal night for frog-walloping. Bill
swung Freddo out and dropped him
gently on to the water, where he swam
valiantly, but hopelessly, against the
“Who slammed that bridge ?”
current, finishing up in the shallows,
where nis struggles ceased. “He’s on a
goolie,” whispered Bill, and raised the tip
of the rod to ease him off. The line
tightened and Bill struck. A wriggling
dark shape rose into the air and whizzed
past my ear to fall with a thump at the
rear. “A flamin’ eel! ” snarled the angler
disgustedly. “That’s what you think,” I
exclaimed, leaping up. The captive
didn’t waste any time, but rose into the
air from almost under our feet and swung
out over the water, where 4ft. of wrist-
thick tiger-snake proceeded to imitate a
yo-yo and write figure-eights against the
skyline. “Get a stick!” There wasn’t
one —there never is. Ducking up to the
camp I got the lantern and the razor-
sharp Kelly. The idea of putting the
snake on the ground and bashing at him
in the dark didn’t appeal to me. “Swing
him over the light whilst I do the Henry
the Eighth act,” I said. Misjudging the
bounce in the rod, however, I cut the
tip a good 6in. in front of the reptile’s
snout. What Bill threatened to do to
me as we raced through waist-high rushes
to the camp was nothing to what that
half-crazed tiger threatened to do to the
pair of us when he fell on the hot lantern
and put it out.

“Bo”: The young city cove had been
listening attentively but with some be-
wilderment while Dad had been giving
the family at dinner-time the reasons why
he hadn’t bought McDonald’s chestnut.
Dad wound up a highly-technical
dissertation with the damning fault of
the prad—that it “interfered.” It was
then that young Harold spoke up. “I
don’t blame you, sir,” he said. “I
wouldn’t buy a nag either that couldn’t
mind its own business!”
* * * *
“Loulalo”: The morning after our local
butcher killed I bought a short wing-rib
roast, unboned, and hung it in the meat-
safe built under a water-tank'. The
weather was fine and cool. Passing the
safe the next night, which was moonless,
I was attracted by a queer luminous glow.
Closer inspection showed the roast, both
its cut surfaces gleaming palely. The
beef was still quite fresh, and the rest of
the family confirmed that my eyesight was
not at fault. The meat, roasted next day,
was as delicious as always. The butcher
states that it is not an unusual occur-
rence, but he can’t explain it. The
bullock was locally raised, and, though
this is a somewhat mineralised area, I’ve
never heatd of radioactivity in the district.
Pastures were possibly top-dressed, but
would phosphorus become absorbed to
that extent?

“Horseless Horseman”: I won’t forget
the old Toorak pub on the Julia Creek-
Kynuna stock-route (B. 13/9/,’ 50) —I
helped pull it down 25 years ago. And
what a godforsaken site it stood on!
Except for a row of scant coolibahs that
boasted the name of Eastern Creek, and
a huge cemetery hard by, there was
nothing to be seen from the pub veranda
except an horizon that was a waving,
simmering blur of heat. The hostelry,
though on the run, was out of bounds to
stationhands, and the trouble was that
the red paint on the corrugated-iron pub
walls and veranda-posts was “moulting”
—if the overseer caught anyone with red
paint on him it meant the sack. Bert
O’Neil, the last publican, worked as a
ringer on the station afterwards, and one
day in the ’26 drought we both accom-
panied the manager of Toorak, H. Powne,
on a trip up the Flinders where Ted
Briety, one of the drovers with a station
mob, was well in trouble —poor horses,
no feed, and his starving sheep all over
the place because of a dingo in the brake.
I was mighty glad when the boss an-
nounced that O’Neil was going and not
I, so I asked Bert how he felt. “I
wouldn’t mind at all if I had thought to
bring a fishing-line,” was the ex-Toorak
publican’s only comment.

“Salmon Gums”: Westralians seldom
wax effusive over the literary outpourings
of their daily Press, but at last some of
this printed matter is being taken seri-
ously. It seems the stuff is lethal to
rabbits. You stuff it in the entrances
to the warrens. The rabbits, attempting
to scratch or wade through the heavy
going, get scared and slink back into
the warren, to starve to death. That's
the general idea,, and one Road Board
whose vermin - inspector tried it out
reckons it works. They said they were
amazed. So am I, but it might be worth
a try.

“B. A. Ker”: At a very youthful age
I learned the strengths and weaknesses
in the armaments of the wogs in my life.
Hornets were essentially “in-fighters” ; at
long-range they were harmless. “Spit-
fires,” on the other hand, could get in
their dirty work from a distance of any-
thing up to 3ft. Therefore a gumleaf
on which a colony of the writhing, weav-
ing caterpillars fed was always viewed
from beyond spitting range. The “itchy
grub” (processional caterpillar) left be-
hind a powerful irritant where’er he
walked ; moreover, a garment over which
he had crawled would still produce
painful lumps on the wearer if donned 12
hours later. But last week —30-odd
years later —I encountered a strange wog
that was armed with the worst features
of all three. A gumleaf swished back as
I walked along a track. Instantly some-
thing stung me on the upper lip. Investi-
gation showed a green, horned cater-
pillar about an inch and a quarter long.
His legs seemed to join the body in a
series of V-shaped serrations. By this
time the lip had begun to swell. Within
five minutes my nose was also smarting
badly ; it too began to swell. A little
later an irritation developed on my fore-
head. Obviously, while stinging me on
the lip the creature had also sprayed an
irritant on my nose and forehead —the
last-named copping a delayed-action
potion. Application of the bluebag eased
the smarting, but for five hours I re-
sembled a caricaturist’s nightmare: a
bloke with an upper lip like Ben Chifley’s
and a nose like Stanley Bruce s.
THE VERANDA.
Though far is that home that our memories
environ
And dim is the picture it faintly recalls
Of sun-dazzled roofing of galvanised-iron
Surmounting a straggle of weatherboard walls,
There is one feature left us beyond all forgetting,
A gift that the long years have never mislaid,
A pearl of remembrance, a gem in the setting—
Its vineclad veranda of coolness and shade.
At eve we would lounge there, all chaffing and
talking,
Our tired limbs released and our minds set at
ease,
And watch where the furtive dark shadows went
stalking
Like blackfellow ghosts through the dim
pepper-trees;
And there with the white stars around us and
o’er us
Would hear from the lignum that edged the
lagoon
The croak of the bullfrogs that lifted in chorus
Their deep-throated chant to the rise of the
moon.
Here spun we our stories of saddle and stirrup
To drift through the vine and be lost in the
stars,
While countless cicadas with challenging'chirrup
Would deafen the dark in the bunch of belars.
And far down that road we so often passed over
We’d glimpse the red rose of a campfire that
tells
The long day is done for some teamster or
drover,
And hear in the ridges the clash of his bells.
But Time will not linger. What use of our
hoarding
Those fanciful treasures of sound and of sight,
For other men’s rowels now ring on that
boarding
And other men bow to those spells of the
night?
Goodbye and farewell to that distant veranda,
Its moonlight and magic and whispering trees,
And all that they mean to an old overlander
Who sends them his greeting from over the
seas.

“Kelms”: There’s an argument raging
in this neck of the woods. When a doe,
pursued by dogs, throws a joey from her
pouch, does she do it in an attempt to
save the joey or herself? I don’t know,
so I’m putting it to the Council. I’ve
seen the joey discarded at several dif-
ferent stages in the flight, and, generally
speaking, wjien it occurs early in the
chase the doe escapes at the expense of
the joey; when the doe carries him until
she is becoming exhausted, the joey
escapes, being fresher than the tiring
dogs, who
c o ncentrate
on the doe.
She, having
s a c r i ficed
herself by
carrying the
a d d i tional
weight for
so long,
has literally
given her
life for her
young, and I’m prepared to give her
credit for it. Tom isn’t. He reckons she
tosses the kid to the dogs at the last
minute, and is merely a victim of her
“ D'you want a couple of air-minded cadets?"
own miscalculations. I know that if a
doe and her joey are surprised while
sleeping, the two are invariably going in
different directions within 20 yards of
the commencement of the chase, seem-
ingly in an attempt to confuse the
pursuers.

“Mat’s Mate”: Ungarie, wheat town
north of Wyalong, slept heavily one hot
night, and Mat and I shared a room in
the pub. Came a knock at our window
and a voice, “Hey, mate, any chance of
a drink? We just got in from Condo.”
Mat said, “Try the publican ; room at
the head of the passage.” Retreating
footsteps, then silence. Presently came
another knock at the window and the
voice complained, “Hey, mate, he told
us t’ go t’ hell.” Mat sat up in his bunk
and said, “Well, head south-west an’ y’
can’t miss it; it’s between Hay an’ Booli-
gal. But they sold all the beer there
back in the 1920 drought an’ ain’t had
none since.” The night shot back a
reflection on Mat’s legitimacy, after which
we were left in peace.
* * * *
“Wippegong”: “As the lines of com-
munication lengthened the operation
slowed down,” and although they had
overlooked that profound statement in
the dailies the fairy-martins knew what
it meant. When they started decorating
the wall just below the eaves of Richard-
son’s shed with little mud-scallops the
road was nicely damp and there was a
good selection of handy puddles from
which to select material of just the right
consistency; but two days of withering
westerlies dried all the shallow spots and
sent the little rusty-headed fossickers
down the slope to the deep ruts in front
of Barton’s gate. Thanks to the wheels
of heavily-laden trucks there was enough
mud there to make a pisd village ; but,
despite the ample supply, the growth of
the line of mud-bottles slowed down
noticeably. Then up came a thunder-
storm, and again puddles dotted the road
right up to the shadow of the shed, and
the tiny plasterers soon had the nearest
thing that birds could get to a bucket
brigade. Down to the road, a beakful
of mud, up over the fence, a moment on
the wall, down to the road again, follow-
my-leader they went, and the air itself
was flickering. Just now the bottles are
half-done, or a little more, and the bowls
are big enough to accommodate sparrows,
and the openings still large enough to
admit them ; and the aggressive spadger
is doing his darndest to grab a cheap flat.
May it rain again tonight; if the martins
have to finish the job with mud from the
gully the sprigs
might just manage
to shove in some
lining while the
rightful owners are
battling to bring
home the front
door, and once in
they’d be hard to
shift. The idea then
would be to close
the lost home right
up, but as the news-
item above has
escaped them they
probably haven’t
heard of Poe’s
“Cask of Amontil-
lado” trick, either.
“M.S.”: With
the increase i n
rabbits comes the
need everywhere
for dogs, and as no
one seems to have
bothered about
those animals for a
few years there’s a
hampering scarcity.
On the rare occa-
sions a litter of
grey h o u nds or
whippets offers,
they are scooped
up at big prices.
When a paddock
has been dug out,
nothing is so good
as a pack of dogs
for clearing up
the loose bunnies,
and, realising their worth, one old bloke
in this district immediately hopped in to
take advantage of the situation. He has
collected a pack of 20 to 30 mongs, none
of which is worth more than a pea-rifle
cartridge. They are the district’s discards
of unwanted pets, misfits, non-workers and
no-hopers which, closing in collectively
on fern or other cover, reap a percentage
of rabbits by sheer weight of numbers.
Their owner, past is in great
demand, and makes big wages riding
around with his ill-assorted tribe. It
seems the time is ripe for someone to
start breeding decent runners —say, a
good greyhound-whippet cross —for there
is a good and ready market. Easy
enough, no trouble and not much time
required. Excellent sideline for anybody.
Eh? Me! Aw, cut it out —I’ve got
more to do than fool around with a lot
of pesty pups.

“Solitude”: We were nearing the town,
and Seventyfiver was gazing at a shrubby
“Maybe it IS small now , but this green timber ain't finished growing yet."
patch on a slope ahead, when a figure
rounded it and came towards us. “Who’s
the cove, Sol?” “Looks like the new
noxious-weeds inspector.” “Aw, yair, I
know. Blokes they send out here from
the city,” he said, “t’ tell us what all our
things is no good for.” The bloke drew
near. “ ’Day,” Seventyfiver greeted
affably. “Lookin’ at the country? Well,
what’s that there thing that’s sprung up
on the ridge over yonder?” he inquired.
“That patch y’ just come past.” The
newcomer glanced back. “Oh, it’s a
patch of decurrens,” he replied. “Eh?”
“One of the acacia group, you know,”
explained the inspector. “Decurrens
grows very quickly, and evidently that
patch has come from seed.” “Yair? Y’
don’t say! ” Seventyfiver looked con-
cerned as we went on, and presently he
rode out of his way to look at the patch
in question. “Well, if that don’t just go
t’ show y’ what things is cornin’ to, Sol,”
he announced disgustedly, when he re-
joined me. “They send blokes like that
out inter the country, an’ call ’em in-
spectors, an’ the poor silly cow don’t even
know wattle scrub when he sees it.”
* * * *
“Zake”: Suddenly switching the car
lights on on a quiet country road I
caught a hare in its beams. The rodent
stopped in its tracks, then began to skip
around in the best imitation of a dance
I’ve seen in anything out of feathers —
what it lacked in the grace of the brolga
it made up for in nimbleness. The
knockabout comedian seemed in no par-
ticular hurry, either, to disappear into
‘he wings after its act. “Mad as a March
hare” seems to have some truth in it;
certainly this was a form of insanity—it
seemed to scorn the possibility of my
having a gun. But does the temporary
aberration of the tricky runner always
take a terpsichorean form?
* * * *
“Betcha”: “Gravelsnatcher” (B.
13/9/’5O) likes to attribute to animals
virtues he wouldn’t look for in the human
race. Maybe he knows that sort better,
and, though I hate to smash his illusion,
I know the four-legged variety pretty
well. He questions my claim that even
when working together it is each fox for
himself, and, mentioning a raid on a
chook-house, states that a fox going
about his lawful business doesn’t adver-
tise the fact. I grant that a ginger bloke
bent on unlawful business doesn’t, though
he may occasionally challenge from the
darkness for the purpose of locating the
farm-dogs. But it isn’t a footrace he is
after. However, except in the mating
season, it is not usual for a fox to bark.
Occasionally he resorts to reason, but
Johnny’s behavior is mainly instinct, and
many a happening attributed to his pro-
verbial cunning is mere instinct-driven
behavior or chance. “G,” says that
“animals which hunt in pairs share the
kill, so why shouldn’t faxes?” Why? It’s
easy. And you can take my word for it,
mate, that fox No. 1 doesn’t whack his
chook with fox No. 2 unless the latter is
bigger than he is. Dogs hunt in packs,
but they, too, only share because they
can’t help it. The same thing goes for
dingoes, crows, bush-cats, etc., and blokes
who pay their income-tax. Only when
the catch is large and more than the boss-
dog (or fox) immediately requires does
he allow the smaller mong to chew the
further end.
* * * *
“Ta’alofa”: The two old blokes who
eke out a precarious existence fossicking
on a deserted goldfield, and who brought
childhood memories flooding back of a
couple of characters, Butterball and Tall
Thomas, in an illustrated paper, had pro-
duced with the air of a couple of con-
spirators a large stone-jar, and from it
poured a cloudy, ropey liquid. “Home-
brew,” said Butterball with a wink. “We
makes it
from that
drake - seed
what the
cocky
farmers
winnows
out of their
wheat.” It
smelled like
the real
thing, and I emptied my glass before I
got the full flavor. I was still thinking
of the taste of the cockroach I had once
chewed up when I stole some raisins from
the pantry in the dark, and was wonder-
ing what to say about the beer without
hurting the feelings of my hosts, when
Tall Thomas gave me the chance I sought
by saying, with all the pride of a mother
in her firstborn, “You don’t buy beer
like that now.” I was able fervently to
agree with him.
* * * *
“S.W.K.”; Knud, the New Australian,
was picking up English with commend-
able speed, but he was obviously puzzled
at times by the idioms and the similarity
of certain words. When he first lobbed at
the station he gave a rather stilted “Tank
you,” but before long he had fallen into
the habit of using the familiar “Ta”
which he heard around the homestead.
One day the boss let him try his hand at
shearing. At his first go he gave his
sheep a slight nick. After he had
finished the boss, noticing the broken
skin, called to Knud “Tar!” The New
Australian seemed rather puzzled, and
the boss repeated his request. Then, in
acknowledgment of this unusual polite-
ness on the part of the boss, Knud nodded
and replied, “Doan mention it!”
THE ROAD.
I made the rising moon go back
Behind the shouldering hill,
I raced along the eastward track
Till time itself stood still.
The stars swarmed on behind the trees,
But 1 sped fast as they.
I could have made the sun arise,
And night turn back to day.
And like a long black carpet laid
Behind the wheels, the night
Unrolled across the countryside,
But all ahead was bright.
The fence-posts whizzed along the wires
Like days that fly too fast,
And telephone-poles loomed up like years
And slipped into the past.
And light and movement, sky and road
And life and time were one,
While through the night I rushed, I sped,
I drove towards the sun.

Over the last five years the story of this
big industrial group—parent and eight
subsidiaries, which together operate 17
factories scattered throughout the Com-
monwealth—has been one of rapid ex-
pansion in all sections of the undertaking,
which is the largest of its kind south of
the equator. On the tyre and tube side,
which accounts for about half total turn-
over, the following comparison of motor-
vehicles on the roads in Australia (service
vehicles excluded) is a pointer to what
has happened:—

1950 .. .. 755,861 496,720 132,834
In addition there has been a big increase
in the output of heavy-truck and agri-
cultural tyres, and a lot of new plant has
been installed for this and other purposes.
Products of the subsidiaries, all of which
have made substantial additions to plant,
include rubber footwear, flooring and
belting, latex upholstery and mattresses,
wet-cell batteries, tennis racquets and gut
and golf-balls, etc.
No less than £5,924,873 net was
added to the book-value of fixed and
trading assets of the group over
the five years to June 30 last —
freeholds (up £460,499), plant, etc., (up
£1,055,543), stocks (up £3,272,033) and
book debts (up £1,136,798). To help
meet the outlay, the amount coming to
trade and other creditors (including the
bank) was increased by £1,765,387, and
£1,250,000 of 4i p.c. debenture money
(put up by the A.M.P. Society) was
gathered just before the books were ruled
off at June 30 last. The cash holding
(down £1,397,499 over the same period),
together with surplus earnings and pro-
visions, provided the balance. Moreover,
no time was lost in finding profitable
employment for the additional funds, as
a glance at the profits column of the
table shows. It all suggests alert manage-
ment and careful planning and budget-
ing throughout the group.
To finance still further growth of the
undertaking, those on the register at
October 6 are to be offered 941,414 new
£1 ords., one for four, at a premium of
10s. each. The issue will thus bring in
£1,412,121, of which £470,707 will be
premiums, making an 8 p.c. div. on the
capital portion worth only 5.3 p.c. It
will raise paid capital to £5,637,069 in
930,000 10 p.c. bum. prefs. and
4,707,069 ords. On that lot the pref. div.
and 8 p.c. to the ords. will call for
£469,565, or £96,554 less profit than was
earned last term, and there will be a lot
of new money at work to help earnings.
All sections of the business contributed
to the record turnover and profit last
term. After allowing an extra £131,081
for depreciation (£370,070), and whatever
was considered necessary for taxation and
other contingencies, the profit increased
by £303,001, reaching £757,118. That
covered the pref. div. (£93,000) and 17.6
p.c. on ord. capital as against 9.6, 11.6
and 11.3 p.c. for the three preceding
terms. It is a heartening performance
considering the coal strike, which inter-
rupted production early in the term, and
the continued rise in the cost of labor,
transport and materials, especially raw
rubber. On shareholders’ funds (capital
and reserves combined) the year’s profit
was 11.6 p.c.; so the new debenture
capital, which is redeemable by instal-
ments over a period of 20 years, looks
like earning more than its keep. Because
money is wanted in the business, the div.
was kept at 8 p.c., and £175,000 was ear-
marked as a stock-revaluation reserve.
That is because of the uncertain future of
raw rubber. Before the Korean incident,
production of the stuff was running well
ahead of commercial consumption, but
accelerated rearmament has lately
bumped up both demand and price.
The next table shows how the new
debenture-money and the year’s surplus
earnings and provisions were used:

The premium on the proposed new
share-issue disappointed the market, and
the price of the co.’s f.-p. 16s. shares,
which rose from 365. a year ago to 41s.
at the end of August, dropped to 395. 9d.
last week. To help finance expansion of
the business, 433,125 new 16s. shares
are to be issued at an early date, one
for five, at a premium of 10s. each. Last
previous issues were at a premium of Bs.
a share in 1938 and 1939. The proposed
issue will bring in £563,062, including
£216,562 of share premiums, which will
make an 8 p.c. div. on the remaining
£346,500 of share capital worth 6.1 p.c.
Paid capital will be £2,079,000, on which
8 p.c. will call for £166,320, or £9441
more profit than was shown last term.
Subject to any major economic disturb-
ance, appearances are that the current
rate of distribution is not likely to be
interfered with. After exercising the
rights to the proposed issue, the net price
of the scrip at 395. 3d. is 375. 5d., giving
an immediate return of only 3.4 p.c. on
an 8 p.c. basis. So the investor who
looks for, say, 4.3 p.c. on his money
counts on the div. going to 10 p.c., or
on other benefits, such as a further issue
of new shares on favorable terms later on.
During the decade to the close of
accounts in 1939, the co. added £1,602,198
of the book-value of fixed assets, largely
on hotel account, thus widening and
tying the market for its products. Mean-
while, the Australian output of beer
climbed from 90 million gallons in
1938-39 to 156 million gallons in 1949-50,
when the increase for the year was 10
million gallons, or 6.8 p.c. Over the same
period consumption per head of popu-
lation rose from 12 to 19 gallons, and,
apart from lifts in excise, there has been
no increase in the brewers’ selling-price.
Thus far expanding turnover has more
than taken care of the persistent rise in
costs of labor, materials and distribution.
How long it will continue to do so is
difficult to say at the moment. Although
the overall- outlook for the Australian
economy is expansionary, the present in-
flationary trend, which is accelerating at
an alarming rate, undoubtedly holds a
sting in its tail. The position will
become less obscure when the Federal
and State Governments decide what they
will do to arrest the drift. Meanwhile,
N. S. Wales brewers are pressing the State
Government to follow the example of
Victoria, where the selling-price of beer
has been lifted by sd. a gallon over,the
last couple of years.
Last term Toohey’s gross earnings shot
up by £508,855, or 20.7 p.c. as against
the Australian average increase in output
of 6.8 p.c.—that was after allowing
£43,267 for depreciation and an unstated
amount for bad debts, etc.:

After maintaining plant ki a high state of
efficiency out of current revenue, there
was a net growth of £71,150 in fixed
assets, while debtors’ balances on trade
account (£630,598) increased by £264,155
and advances to subsidiaries (£101,974)
by £57,815. Cash, etc., was drawn upon
for £193,821, stocks were reduced by
£18,179 and £25,417 was added to the
creditors item. The loans are a domestic
matter, being advances from the finance
subsidiary, Toohey’s Standard Securities,
Ltd., in which the public holds the pref.
capital (£750,000 p.c.) and the parent
49,979 £1 ords. paid to £12,500. As
materials and labor become available the
remodelling, rebuilding and extension of
the brewery and hotel properties will call
for substantial outlay, to help meet which
the new share-issue already referred to
is to be made.

* Leap in net earnings due largely to change in
method of presenting the accounts.
This big and fashionable department
store, which specialises in quality
goods, doesn’t broadcast its turnover,
gross earnings and exes. ' However, the
principal factor contributing to the spring
of £28,138 in last term’s net earnings was
the increased “volume” of sales, despite
a bad getaway early in the term, owing
to the nation-wide coal strike. This in-
crease^ —it appears to have come mainly
from the continued rise in * prices and
partly from an increase in physical
volume—more than offset the sharp
advance in wage and all other costs.
Moreover, the supply position eased, and
the co. was able to work down stocks
over the twelvemonth by £240,185. Dur-
ing the same period the wholesale-price
index increased by approximately 15 p.c.
in Australia and 10 p.c. in Britain, and
the Australian retail index rose by 15 p.c.
The record £217,928 of profit—written
after allowing for depreciation (£38,311,
up £9315) and taxation (£147,000, up
£l9,ooo)—covered the pref. divs. (to-
gether £40,000) and 44.4 p.c. on ord.
capital as against 37.4 p.c. and 50.2 p.c.
for the two preceding terms. Earlier
figures are not strictly comparable be-
cause of a change in the method of pre-
senting the accounts. The cautious board
kept the div. at 10 p.c., and, after sending
£lO,OOO to the staff fund, nearly 59 p.c,
of the year’s profit remained in the busi-
ness, lifting reserves £47,301 in excess of
paid capital. In addition there is a special
stock reserve of £300,000, equal to ss. Id.
in the £ of the total inventory figure,
which appears at or under cost. This
is a hedge against any fortuitous drop in
prices that might arise from currency
adjustments, or other causes.
The financial position further
strengthened;

capital structure —200,000 6 p.c.

the strong reserve position favor
maintenance of a high rate of

Korea and its repercussions,
chiefly rearmament, and by the

No dealings in the Wentworth’s
scrip have been shown in the
Official Stock Exchange Gazette
since the beginning of 1950.
Holders are sitting tight pend-
ing the outcome of negotiations
for sale of the business and
assets to Qantas Empire Air-
ways, Ltd. Although discussions
between the parties had been,
and continue, on a strictly con-
fidential basis, whispers concern-
ing them were heard in the by-
ways , of the market. So a
circular to shareholders,
originally dated Dec. 12, 1949,
was sent out on May 31, 1950,
stating that negotiations in
which the co. was interested
were taking place. The altera-
tion in the date of the circular
was “due to the fact that a delay
occurred in the directors’ plans.”
When the discussions are com-
plete, shareholders will be told
if the outcome is to their benefit,
the board says. And there the
matter stands for the present.
The hotel is on the slopes of
Church Hill, practically in the
heart of the city, yet outside the
hurly-burly, and now enjoys a
wide goodwill of which no
account is taken in the books.
The present co. was formed in
1912, when it bought the original
freehold for £20,000. This was
subsequently extended by pur-
chase of an adjoining property,
and substantial additions were
made to the premises during the
last half of the 1930’5. At June
30 last freehold stood in the
books at £107,972 (cost), and
furniture, plant, etc., at £46,511
(cost), the lot less £36,570 for
depreciation, or £117,913 net,
and obviously worth a great deal
more at today’s values.
Here is as much as the pub-
lished accounts tell:

The financial position is com-
fortable, and the net tangible
cover (book-value) is 465. 7d.
per f.-p. pound share.
For over a decade the earning-
power of the business has been
steadily gathering strength,
thanks to completion of the new
residential wing before World
War 11, the popularity of the
ballroom, the attention given to
service, and the overwhelming
demand for accommodation dur-
ing and since the war. After
allowing for depreciation, taxa-
tion and staff superannuation,
and despite a steep rise in costs,
as well as other difficulties, the
board was able to show a record
profit of £16,068 (up £3746) last
term. That was equal to 32.1
p.c. on capital as against 24.6,
20.4, 24.4, 23.6 and 19.1 p.c.
back to 1945. The div,, steady
at 10 p.c. for the last nine years,
was sweetened with a bonus of
2\ p.c. in 1949 and of 5 p.c. last
term, making total distribution
for the year 15 p.c. It is an out-
standing performance in the
hotel group.

This Melbourne-controlled co.
(paid capital £127,500 in 10s.
shares) is mining and treating
beach sands at Byron Bay
(N.S.W.) for zircon, rutile and
other minerals. Chief factor
responsible for the shrinkage of
profits has been the collapse of
the American market for the
minerals. Last term sales con-
tinued to decline, owing to re-
stricted demand and strong
competition. Also production
ceased for the first three months
of the term, because of the coal
strike, and costs increased. The
market improved during the
second half, and minimum ex-
port prices for the products were
fixed. The year’s profit was writ-
ten after allowing £15,253 (up
£702) for depreciation, but be-
fore writing off £4500 on ac-
count of research. Production,
treatment and recovery figures
aren’t published. When the
books closed current assets
totalled £73,534 and current
liabilities (including the div.)
£15,655. The scrip, which rose
to 225. 6d. in 1949, recently sold
at 10s. 6d.
Richer ore and the rise in the
price of gold gave the earnings

lifted from 6d. to 9d. a share,
money being wanted for de-
velopment at the 400 ft. level.
Bulk of last term’s ore came
from the 300 ft. level, now nearly

serves were conservatively esti-
mated at 8500 tons, averaging
19-23dwt., of which 1500 tons
were at 300 ft. and 3500 tons at
400 ft. The lower horizon is ex-
pected to yield in excess of
12.000 tons. Developments on
this field are on the “follow-the-
ore” principle, A heap of tail-
ings, estimated to be worth
£280,000 at the present price of
gold, awaits treatment by the
new cyaniding plant, which is
expected to be at work before
1950 runs out. Cash, bullion and
debtors total £32,685 and current
liabilities £5030. The scrip
fetches 14s. 6d. in the market.

treated 31,766 tons ore for

B.4dwt., and a profit of £6669
for the year to March 31 last.
Mining and treatment costs were
87s. a ton. The ore came from
the Surprise and Baraba leases,
where 83,200 tons, averaging
lldwt, has been measured up,
with prospects of more payable
stuff being developed. The
Birthday Gift, at Burbanks, held
under option, has been un-
watered, and the drill has dis-
closed ore in two narrow
synclines for about 1000 ft. east
of the old workings The
Callion, Davyhurst, about 70
miles north of Coolgardie, has
been bought from W.M.C. for
52.000 f.-p. 10s. shares, plus some
cash. Here 63,000 tons of
lOdwt. ore has been developed
in a quartz vein in a shear in the
greenstone. The ore is to be
transported by road to Cool-
gardie for treatment. Co. has
also exercised its option over
four other leases at Hampton,
price £2OOO, and options over
additional ground at Burbanks
have been extended.

took £55,000, making aggregate
distributions to date £365,000, or
18s. 3d. a share. Another 9d, a
share went out at the end of
last month. It was the lift in
the price of gold that put the
spring into profits, Co, treated
19,919 tons (up 2891 tons) ore
for 15,4920 z, (up 510 z.) fine
gold, an average of 15.56dwt.
(down 2.58dwt.) per ton, the re-
covery being 91 p.c. Despite the
rise in wage-rates, etc., mining
and milling costs were 2.65.
lighter at 88.55. a ton. Develop-
ment and drilling lifted all-in
costs to 100.1 s. a ton, same as
previous year. Ore reserves were
put at 50,000 tons (up 3000
tons) averaging 13dwt. (down
2.Bdwt.), and the drill has indi-
cated that more pay-ore awaits
development. Testing of the
Loch Fyne mine has begun, but

have been met with so far. When

Profits-limitation Tax?
It is reported from Canberra
that W. Kent Hughes, Victorian
M.P., “has been talking in
terms of a profits-limitation tax”
in order to combat inflation.
No further details of Mr.
Kent Hughes’s profit-limitations
plan were given, so it is not
known whether the idea is to
embrace pastoralists, wheat-
growers, professional men and
the like, or only what are known
as “businesses,” which are
generally companies, public or
private.
Quite likely there are some
incorporated businesses making
very large profits by any
standard of comparison. But the
whole matter deserves close
analysis and consideration. And
the case for no “profits-limita-
tion” tax will stand very close
analysis.
To begin with, daily-Press
headlines, necessarily abbrevi-
ated, are very misleading so far
as company affairs are con-
cerned. Terse but bold state-
ments like “Co.’s Profits
Doubled,” “Chain-store’s Record
Profit” or “One-for-one Bonus
Issue by Sydney Co.” need
further elaboration if a true pic-
ture is to be got of what is going
on in regard to the finances of
industry today.
Profits that were doubled in
a recent year will often be found
to be lower than those of the
same concern in a pre-war year,
and Increased capital may have
had a lot to do with a chain-
store’s record profit. Again,
many bonus-share issues made
during the past two years repre-
sent no more than the capitalisa-
tion of share premiums which
were charged to shareholders
under the Treasury’s capital-
issues control.
To get the profits of industry
into proper focus they must be
considered in the aggregate. And
the Commonwealth Bank pro-
duces statistics which make it
easy for anyone wanting to
know the truth to do this.
Central-bank statistics show
that approximately 560 com-
panies which in 1939 had £422
million of shareholders’ funds
earned 6.8 p.c. on those funds
in that last pre-war year.
In 1949 —ten years later —the
same group of companies had
funds of £524 million and
earned 8.1 p.c. on them.
Last year’s 8.1 p.c. represents
an increase of approximately 19
p.c. over 1939’s 6.8 p.c. The
basic wage, which is supposed
to reflect the cost of living, has
meantime increased by about
90 p.c. The cost of plant-
replacement and factory-con-
struction has more than doubled.
Public-company profits, of
course, are not tax-free. All
dividends are taxed at full rates
in the hands of shareholders, in
addition to taxes already borne
by the company.
Some proportion of the funds
employed by public companies
undoubtedly represents the in-
vestment of post-war pounds.
But, as will be seen from the
foregoing figures, at the most
they account for no more than
a fifth of the average capital
employed.
Looking at the overall pic-
ture, these comments by the
governor of the Commonwealth
Bank in his last annual report
are relevant; “Indications are
that profits of companies of
most types [in 1949-50] were
greater than in the previous
year. There appears, however,
to have been an increasing
tendency to plough back profits
to finance plans for expansion
and to meet the need for a
larger amount of working capi-
tal in the face of rising costs.”
This has been noticeable in
such a case as the large and
seemingly wealthy C.S.R., which
not only reduced its dividend
last year but has charged share-
holders a premium on a new
issue of shares. Australasian
Paper, too, without any Treasury
compulsion, has charged a 2s. 6d.
“It’s for my husband — next-door .”
premium on its present issue of
shares.
These premiums are needed in
order to offset the present in-
flated cost of plant-replacement,
for which past depreciation
provision allowed by the taxa-
tion department is now hope-
lessly inadequate.
Masonite Corporation
(N.S.W.) reports that replace-
ment of its assets now would
cost at least £400,000 above their
original cost, whereas its total
capital at present is only
£300,000. This concern, which
is selling its production at 20
p.c. to 30 p.c. below 1939 prices,
last year set aside £50,000 out
of profits for replacement of de-
preciated assets.
The whole matter of profits-
limitation therefore needs to be
gone into very carefully. It is
a fact, which has been pretty
well evidenced in the foregoing,
that investors have really had a
poor deal in the reshuffling of
the national income that came
with war and post-war Social-
ism, and this is so quite regard-
less of seemingly high prices for
shares on the Stock Exchanges
at present.
Furthermore, to interfere
arbitrarily with profit-earning
might do nothing at all to re-
duce living costs. The possible
gains are slight so far as manu-
factured foodstuffs are con-
cerned, whilst increased inflation
is always possible if incentives
are interfered with too far.
If net profits (after payment
of company taxes only) of all
companies, public and private,
were aggregated it would be
found that, today, their total was
very little larger than the cost of
social services, and that, in any
case, they represented less than
10 p.c. of the total national
income.
Further, owing to the
“plpughing-back” of their earn-
ings in order to increase the
facilities for the production of
goods and services they tend to
be an anti-inflationary factor in
that they facilitate the produc-
tion of more goods and ser-
vices, whereas taxation taken by
the Governments tends to find
its way into consumer-spend-
ing-power all too readily.
Up-valuation of the pound
externally, which would bring
goods more cheaply and more
plentifully into Australia, would
tend to force costs-reductions all
round, stimulate competition in
industry and reduce the cost of
plant-replacement —all of which
should tend to check inflation.
N.Z. Forest Products
Production and profit records
have been chalked up by New
Zealand Forest Products, Ltd.,
Maoriland’s largest co. and a
giant among, privately-owned
forestry enterprises in the world,
for the latest year (to March
31), and there’s a rising tempo
in business that looks like con-
tinuing.
The co., with 55,000 share-
holders (two-thirds of them
Australian) and £6,198,935 paid
capital, is now a 14-year-old, but
its rise covers only the last
seven years. Net profit is
£107,552, from manufacturing
and investment, and there is
£30,198 from forests to lift
accumulated earnings to
£526,289> Directors say it’s still
too early to be thinking about
divs., so the funds are being
held as a growing nest-egg.
Results over seven years are:

The recent term was the eighth
since manufacturing operations
were launched, but compared
with what is ahead the co. is
still only in the warming-up
stage. There’s no selling prob-
lem yet, and so far it hasn’t been
possible to touch more than the
fringe of the Australian demand
for timber products, but there
are bottlenecks on the produc-
tion side, mainly through short-
ages of railway wagons and
electricity.
In the past twelvemonth the
co. had the chance to fill some
sizeable orders from abroad, the
most distant from Britain, but
it couldn’t do much more than
test out prospects. If more pro-
cessed board and sawn timber
could have been shipped turn-
over would have been well above
the figures reached —a shade
over 50 million square feet of
building board, said chairman
David Henry. With demand
buoyant in Maoriland the co.
had to be patient in developing
export trade.
With another good summer
for growth, the volume of stand-
ing timber in the co.’s 188,000
acres of forests, mainly pine, in-
creased by 294 million log
super-feet, which showed that
the average growth of close on a
million feet a day was being
held.
Demand for multiwall bags
has been near plant capacity,
and the co. is expanding plant
to push up output by 50 p.c.
But overshadowing all other
projects is the £4l million ex-
pansion programme, which aims
at setting up pulp and paper
mills at Kinleith, four miles
from Tokoroa, close to the
forests, in the heart of the
North Island. Sawmills and
logging equipment are part and
parcel of this project, and the
co. is embarked on the biggest
private housing scheme in N.Z.
to accommodate factory opera-
tives, mill-hands and key per-
sonnel. If plans all work out
there should be a roar of in-
dustrial activity around there a
few years hence. The four-year
construction programme, due to
be finished in 1953, rivals Gov-
ernment schemes in size.


Interesting Highlights from
1950 ANNUAL REPORT
OF AUSTRALIAN PAPER MANUFACTURERS LIMITED
AUSTRALIAN Paper Manufacturers Limited has just published
its 1950 illustrated Annual Report.
Record Net Profit for the Year — £361,701
This profit compares with the highest net
profit previously recorded of £284,812 for
the year 1947/48 and with £260,695 for
the year 1948/49,
Sales for the year under review also estab-
lished a record with a total of 133,040 tons.
This was approximately 6,000 tons above
that for the preceding year. It was an
important factor contributing to the
improved profit position.
Particular attention is drawn to the amount
of £339,600 provided for Income Tax.
The current requirement for Income Tax
is only £189,600 but a further amount of
£150,000 has been provided for future
requirements. The gross amount is
approximately £144,000 more than in the
preceding year. The incidence of company
taxation, which is still virtually at its
war-time peak rates, is a very heavy load
for industry to carry.
New Issue of Shares
The 1949 Annual Report explained the
issue of shares made in December, 1948
and debentures in 1949, the final tails in
both instances being payable by the end
of 1950. It was then pointed out that the
development programme would inevitably
call for further substantial expansion of
the capital structure.
It has been possible to proceed a little
more rapidly than was anticipated two
years ago and the next stage has now been
reached where A.P.M. has offered 4,554,106
ordinary shares in the Company to The
Australasian Paper and Pulp Company
Limited at a premium of 2/6d. pet share
payable by instalments spread over the
period ending December, 1951. The
Board of The Australasian Paper and
Pulp Company Limited is making an issue
to its shareholders of an identical number
of shares on the same terms and conditions,
on the basis of one new share for each
share presently held, whether preference
or ordinary and whether partly of fully paid.
Production.
The year’s output of paper and board has
again shown an increase despite difficulties
caused by coal and power shortages last
winter, and by an industrial hold up
lasting several weeks at Botany mill in
January this year.
These production losses were offset to
some extent by the co-operation of the
employees in working some mills through
weekends additional to those normally
rostered.
Total saleable production of paper and
board for 1949/50 was 133,126 tons as
compared with 130,206 tons in the previous
year.
Maryvale pulp mill produced 40,089 tons
of woodpulp as compared with last years’
output of 41,343 tons. This reduction was
largely due to the making of over 3,000
tons of long fibred pine pulp to replace
imported timber.
The Human Side.
The prosperity of our industry depends
upon die effective blending of men,
management, materials and money.
Among the human needs to be satisfied
are opportunity for advancement, good
conditions of work, security, adequate
wages and recognition of work well done.
The Training Scheme which is now in
operation at all mills has been extended
during the past 12 months. It is designed
not only to assist employees to do their
present jobs more satisfactorily but aims
to equip them for promotion to more
skilled positions. During the year a full
time Education Officer was appointed to
the staff of the Personnel Department
to take charge of this important work.
In addition to offering security of employ-
ment, the A.P.M. Security Plan provides
a large measure of protection against the
expenses of illness, for per week is
payable during the first six months _of
absence, with lesser amounts for ensuing
months.
Through Works Committees, Welfare
Committees, Suggestion Committees and
other avenues for joint consultation
between the men and management at the
mills, we recognise the part which those
working in the mills can play in con-
tributing towards efficiency of operations
and improved conditions of work.
Sales and future Markets:
The demand for paper and cardboard in
Australia has been increasing steadily for
many years. The war gave strong impetus
to the use of paper packages in many
forms and accelerated jh Australia the
trend of packaging development towards
the level already achieved in countries
such as the United States of America.
The consumption of paper and cardboard
per head of population in U.S.A. has
generally been about treble that in the
United Kingdom and in Australia.
In the year 1948/49 the total consumption
of cardboard for all purposes was 109 lbs.
per head in Australia whereas it was
358 lbs. per head in U.S.A.
In the course of the market surveys which
have been under continual review since
the latter part of the war, it has been evident
that vast opportunities for further ex-
pansion of the use of paper and cardboard
packaging materials lie before us if Australia
is to approach the usage existing in America.
Construction Progress.
Over 700 men are engaged on construction
work at our various mills numbers
are growing steadily.
Maryvale, (Vic.). The new chemical
recovery boiler for the pulp mill, which
was brought into operation during the
year, has been successful in reducing costs
and ensuring continuity of operations. A
steam raising boiler burning brown coal
was also brought into operation and, as
a result, it has been possible to effect a
substantial saving in fuel cost. A new
turbo-alternator of 3500 kilowatts capacity
is running successfully.
Various buildings connected with the
pulp mill expansion have been completed
and equipment is being installed.
Fairfield (Vic.). Some of the new buildings
have been erected. Extensions to the
capacity of No. 1 board machine are
virtually complete except for the new
electric drive which is to be installed
during the period when the mill is shut
at next Easter.
The finishing room of the new No. 5
M.G. Board mill has been completed and
work has commenced on the buildings
to house the new mill machinery. Most of
this has already been delivered and is
held in store.
The existing boiler plant, originally
installed to burn black coal, has been
converted so that the plant operates
satisfactorily on raw brown coal from
the Maddingley Open Cut. This con-
version is a tribute to the skill of our
engineers, who surmounted many diffi-
culties. In particular could be mentioned
the elimination of fly ash dust, which
initially was emitted from the chimney.
Some other power stations have not yet
overcome this trouble.
Botany (N.S.W.). Two major items in
the power plant have been brought into
operation during the year : firstly a new
boiler with 100,000 lb. per hour capacity
and secondly a further turbo-alternator of
3,500 kilowatts. The installation of these
units has enabled us to dispose of inefficient
low pressure equipment and to achieve
considerable economies in operation.
Moreover, as a result of the Company’s
forward planning of its power plant, we
have sufficient reserve to be in a position
to supply electricity to the Sydney County
Council during the periods of its peak
demands.
Building extensions are commencing on
the large No. 5 Board mill to cope with
the increasing production being obtained
from that unit and to provide more
efficient handling facilities.
Broadford (Vic.). The whole mill is
being rehabilitated and the output ex-
panded. Increased production is resulting
as work is completed on a planned ex-
pansion of the mill. All extensions are
being carried out without loss of pro-
duction time.
Development Activities.
Within the past year a decision was reached
to establish a plant at Maryvale for the
production of chorline and caustic soda.
Some of the caustic soda produced will be
used by the Company and satisfactory
arrangements have already been made as'to
the disposal of the balance. The chlorine at
Maryvale will be used in gaseous form.
The design of the plant and plans for
its operation have been formulated in
association with the well known Monsanto
organisation which is acting as consultants
for the project. We have had the greatest
possible help from the Monsanto Australian
Company and our Project is
developing detailed designs with the
English company at the present time.
Research.
The Board is happy to report that the
further work on dissolving pulps from the
eucalypt on a semi-commercial scale has
been most encouraging. A rayon tyre
yarn has been spun in England from pulp
so produced. During the year Courtaulds
have commenced the construction in
Australia of a plant designed for pro-
ducing tyre yarn which is regarded as an
urgent defence requirement. Until such
time as the dissolving pulps for the
production of this tyre yam can be supplied
wholly within Australia it is obvious that
the defence requirement is not satisfied
adequately. In the work done, the Company
has co-operated closely with the technical
staff of Courtaulds and there is every
reason to believe that, by the time
Courtaulds are in a position to make
tyre yarn in Australia, A.P.M. will be
able to supply a suitable pulp made wholly
from eucalypt.
Copies of the full ReJ ort are obtainable on application to the offices of the Company in Melbourne and Sydney.

London Airmail
From Herbert Holman
After 8i years of tight con-
trol, soap-rationing at last is
over. That stocks were growing
has long been common know-
ledge, and some shopkeepers
have lately shown unaccustomed
forgetfulness in demanding cou-
pons. When essential commodi-
ties are scarce the population
doesn’t as a rule take kindly to
substitutes. The soapless de-
tergent must be a notable ex-
ception to this rule, especially
in London, where the water is
so uncompromisingly hard that
it actually curdles the soap. Like
magic, the detergents lather at
once. Not less interesting is the
full-scale advertising battle that
is being waged between the two
great combines, one British and
the other a subsidiary of an
American firm. Soap bubbles
waft into Piccadilly from a tall
hoarding, cheap samples are
offered to the housewife, and —
in rare contrast to everything
else —prices tend to fall.
Sir Thomas Beechara will
have his say. This time, speak-
ing during the Edinburgh Festi-
val, his chuckling barbs are
directed against London. As
soon hold a festival on Salisbury
Plain as in London, he asserts.
It is true that the plebeian
Promenade Concerts have an
outwardly fustian appearance
when compared to the eclectic
splendor of the Edinburgh offer-
ings, but they are festival enough
in everything but name. Over a
period of two months, nightly
except for Sundays, a total of
280,000 people has listened
attentively, applauded vigorously
and thronged the corridors of
the Albert Hall. The challenge
of indiscrimination has been
quickly met by Sir Malcolm
Sargent, who admits the too-
ready applause; but he makes
sure to acknowledge the deep
concentration of the audience,
especially in long and “difficult”
slow movements. Three orches-
tras, working concurrently, have
also reduced fatigue, and, with
adequate time for rehearsals,
have raised the standard of play-
ing. London, as many foreigners
have remarked, has good rea-
son to be proud of the “Proms.”
Bustin’ Out All Over
When a child persists in blow-
ing up a tough balloon the ten-
sion of waiting for it to burst
can be wellnigh intolerable,
but after the explosion relief
comes quickly and thankfully.
Much the same kind of relief
has followed the formal over-
throw of wage restraint at the
recent Trade Union Congress at
Brighton,
The general opinion is that
the inflationary consequences
will not be much more drastic
than formerly, as wage restraint
was already flabby before the
vote was taken, but it means
that future claims (some
4,000,000 are outstanding) will
have the official backing of the
unions. And the T.U.C., which
has consistently supported the
Government, will be brought in
direct opposition to it. No won-
der that the chairman was
speechless when the count was
made known.
The real solution for Britain’s
masses is not so much mounting
wages as a good, intelligent day’s
work coupled with better pur-
chasing-power for the pay-
packet. But a man needs to be
more than strong-minded to say
“no” to the offer of more money,
especially when his weekly en-
velope doesn’t go far enough
and he has a firm belief, backed
by 550 years of practice, that
trade-unions exist mainly for the
purpose of getting him a rise.
He’s vulnerable here. With re-
mote affairs like the war in
Korea and future rearmament
he can express his views im-
personally and with conviction,
condemning Communism by a
10 to 1 vote.
Much less publicity has been
given to the vote which called
for equal pay for women—“the
rate for the job.” This problem
has been coming to the front for
some while, but has had to be
shelved because of its possible
harmful effect upon the nation’s
economy. Why was it piloted
through the Congress with such
measured skill? Certainly not
because of its urgency. More
likely because it would involve
an immediate addition to the
nation’s wages bill of some
£30,000,000 a year.
Such is the irony of circum-
stance that, within a few days of
this event, 17,000 London bus-
men and -women were out on
strike, ostensibly because two
drivers refused to work with
women conductresses. The rea-
son given was that their case for
more money in future was
weakened by the appointment of
women at the men’s full rate.
There was more in it than that.
of course. There always is.
Happily the strike collapsed on
the fourth day, by which time
the bulk of the strikers were
glad to get back to work.
If there is any lesson to be
learned from these events it is
merely this: that, while England
enjoys a greater immunity from
the Communist peril within than
many near countries, she is not
yet out of the wood ; a few de-
termined militants can still cause
damage out of all proportion to
their number.
Dirty Knight
Emlyn Williams’s new play,
“Accolade,” is about a novelist
who is a Nobel Peace Prize
winner, a newly-dubbed knight,
a contented husband and father
—and an intermittent sexual per-
vert. It is, of course, a tremen-
dous success, promising to beat
all records for the Aldwych
theatre, even those set up re-
cently by “A Streetcar Named
Desire.”
So much for capacity book-
ing. What of the play? The
theme is sordid and abhorrent,
which doesn’t mean that drama-
tists must leave it alone or that
the censor is wrong to pass it.
But notwithstanding its serious
intent and dazzling professional
finesse, “Accolade” makes little
contribution to the theatre in its
rightful function as a platform
for social reform. The deftly-
knit plot teems —overteems —
with dramatic situations, closely
woven into each other and in-
tensely moving in themselves.
The novelist’s own wife knows
of his weakness and surprisingly
accepts it as a quite natural
adjunct to conjugal life, as if it
were of no more consequence
than a weekend round of golf ;
and she receives his fellow-
debauchees with the same wifely
graciousness that she accords to
his publisher. This Sir William
Trenting, author of low-life
novels, is an extrovert who is
unashamed of his gutter-rolling.
It is only when he learns that,
while drunk and befuddled in a
communal orgy, he has com-
mitted an offence against a
prurient wanton of 14 that he
repents. Blackmail by the girl’s
father, a broken-down aca-
demician, provides a strong
climax, with an astonishing
twist that leads to his prosecu-
tion.
By the time this point is
reached and the shocks and sur-
prises have been assimilated it
begins to dawn upon the amazed
watcher in the audience that the
play is developing into an in-
tellectual trial of strength be-
tween Emlyn Williams, play-
wright, and Emlyn Williams, act-
ing the main part. The one sets
a highly - advanced technical
exercise which the other accepts
with undismayed courage, emerg-
ing with first-class honors, even
when he has to explain his sins
to his innocent 15-year-old son.
Diana Churchill triumphantly
succeeds in showing that she be-
lieves in her husband. Anthony
Nicholls gives integral and sub-
stantial support to the structure
of the play; and Dora Bryan is
a comic and engaging debauchee.
Glen Byam Shaw’s production
is, like most of the acting, tech-
nically superfine.
In the hundred years that
have passed since the villainous
Steerforth seduced Little Em’ly
literary shock-absorbence has
become more resilient. What-
ever next?


Women's Letters
From Melbourne
The Children’s Hospital will benefit
considerably from the cabaret fashion
parade held at the Ziegfeld Ballroom,
Malvern. Pam Holland, Joan Easey and
Dawn Ingram modelled some lovely
j sports- and summer-wear. Lady Latham,
who was guest-of-honor, wore a water-
mole coat over her black-and-candy-
i striped gown. Mrs. W. Fowler, president
of the Hawthorn auxiliary of the
Children’s Hospital, was in black velvet
!| trimmed with pink georgette. Mrs. Les
I Dallimore’s powder - blue moss-crepes
I were on ballerina lines.
That really superb hostess Mrs. W. K.
| Burnside, of Toorak, welcomed in a bal-
lerina frock of bronze-green ripple-nylon
; taffeta the many guests who gathered to
do honor to Martin Wang, formerly
Consul for China in Melbourne, and his
charming wife. Madame Wang’s Chinese
gown was in white satin, with sprays of
flowers and leaves embroidered on it.
Wife of the new Chinese Consul for Vic-
toria, Madame Lin, was in a national cos-
tume of midnight-blue satin woven with
gold embroidery. The black faille suit
worn by Mrs. A. G. Warner had cuffs
j and pockets of vivid red embroidered in
gold beads, and was worn with a small
black hat and blue mink jacket. Dr.
Buffer Murphy’s frock was pastel-green ;
a cerise feather trimmed her black hat.
Mrs. Norman Strange’s crepe suit was in
tonings. The Wangs will
leave sfibrtly to make their home in Syd-
ney, for Martin has been appointed
Consul-General for China.
“Over the Border” could well be Mel-
bourne’s current theme-song: Sydney’s
race week is the mecca which has drawn
women in large numbers from the
southern capital. Mrs. Philp Dare is
Randwick-bound. Mrs. Crosbie Hucks
had two strings to her bow: the races
and greeting a sister just back from
America, Mrs. W. H. Horsfall and
daughter Gloria Ladd, staying at the
Belvedere, Mrs. Maurice Nathan at the
Australia and Mrs. Tom Carlyon at the
Wentworth have the spring-meeting air
about them.
The British Memorial Fund Younger
Set gave a welcome-home party at the
Women’s Services Club to their popular
president, Mrs. Len Buxton, who recently
returned home from Colombo, Mrs.
Hugh Syme, who had been to Canada,
and John Knox, who had been abroad
on a business trip. Peter Isaacson, who
was host, reminded the guests that there
was stiff a lot of work ahead of them if
the fund was to fulfil its purpose, which
is to raise money for scholarships. Mrs.
Buxton’s hunter’s-green suit had ocelot
trimmings; her hat was in the same
shade. Mrs. Hugh Syme wore a large
black straw hat with her black
frock. Anne Mclntyre’s outfit combined
a short black velvet coatee, a multi-toned
check skirt and a pert little black velvet
beret. Mrs. Sladen Gibson’s suit was of
donkey-brown duvetyn.
An inaugural function in connection
with the appointment of Colonel Henry
Steel as official representative of the
British Travel and Holiday Association
was held at Menzies’. Sir Edmund Her-
ring was guest-of-honor, and was accom-
panied by Lady Herring. Group-Captain
White represented the Government. Mrs.
T. J. Ryan had gardenias on her grey
tailored suit. Lady Knox wore a silver-
fox cape over her black cocktail frock.
Glamorous evening gowns, attractive
cotton casuals and breathtaking hats were
shown at the afternoon and evening
fashion-parades in aid of the Victorian
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Children. Setting was the beautiful
Toorak home of Mrs. lan Miller. Gowns
were by Magg —the name adopted by
those two most fashion-conscious
designers Mesdames Harold Holt and
Roy Grounds. Henriette Lamotte, of
Sydney, provided the hats. The house-
full sign was up at both sessions, and
funds were increased by the auction of
a Magg creation, a Lamotte hat and per-
fume by Molyneux —Pimm’s and Moly-
neux made a handsome gesture and de-
frayed all the expenses of the parades.
Organising genius was Mrs. T. O. M.
Edwards, and fellow-workers were Mrs.
Geoff Grimwade, who was one of the
mannequins, Mesdames lan Miller,
Chester and Ken Guest, Tom Graham,
Peter Sawyer and Julian Barrett. It has
always been obvious that Mrs. Adrian
Pe r ry —-wife of the U.S. naval attache,
Commander Perry—was the ideal manne-
quin type, and she proved it by showing
glorious suntan and stunning figure
in a white evening gown that was tight-
fitting down to the knees, then flaring out
in a frothy swirl. Guests included Mrs.
Keith Kiddle, check-suited with tan blouse
and white beret; Mrs. Graham Nathan,
in navy suit and white hat; Mrs. John
Mollard, whose choice was a navy-and-
white-checked suit and white hat; and
Mrs. Gerald Alderton, in an all-navy en-
semble.
The linen and cotton casuals were
notable for the perfection of their detail.
Black linen was used extensively for suits,
frocks and beach-wear. For cocktail-
parties white linen was used in heavily-
embroidered frocks. Mrs. Adrian Perry
modelled a natural-linen beach-frock with
a swirling skirt and square halter-neck-
line ; the wide-brimmed hat which went
with it was of raffia trimmed with sea-
shells.
The two-way ensembles were original
and very smart. The moulded jacket
of many suits when removed revealed
white guipure lace blouses, all strapless
and designed for wear with the slim skirt
of the suit for cocktails. The most
attractive of the cotton beach-frocks
featured the halter-neck, either V-shaped
or square-necked. Accessories for the
bare-topped frock included the new
cocoon coat, hip-length, straight and
rather shapeless, after the fashion of the
’twenties ; the stole had one end forming
a sleeve, the other being left free to
be draped as the wearer desired. Evening
styles were reminiscent of the Victorian
era, with bustle effects and draped skirts.
Looped pink-satin ribbon fashioned the
bustle of one full-skirted white gown.
An unusual touch of bobble-trimming—
popular in Queen Victoria’s day—draped
the hipline of a short pink linen strapless
frock. Its bodice was outlined with white
cotton lace.
Lady Snow, who has been travelling
abroad with her husband, will arrive
home in time for the Cup festival. Caul-
field Cup might well find her at the
Delphic working with the Jessie Hender-
son Free Kindergarten Committee, which
has organised a dinner-dance for that
cause. Ticket-secretary is Mrs. Peter
Sawyer (Win. 7053).
When Patricia Pamela, elder daughter
of Dr. and Mrs. A. P. Gorman, of
Deniliquin (N.S.W.), was working in
Washington she met Flight-Lieut. Arthur
Pickering, R.A.A.F., who was attached to
the Australian Embassy there. Now they
are both back in Australia, with marriage
in the offing. Arthur is the only son of
Mr. and Mrs. H. C. Pickering, of Kew,
and last weekend Dr. and Mrs. Gorman
came down to this city to celebrate with
the newly-engaged couple, who will
shortly be going to Deniliquin for the
picnic races.
After a brief holiday in Australia the
High Commissioner for Australia in
India, Roy Gollan, and Mrs. Gollan
sailed in Strathmore last Monday. Many
friendships made in India were renewed
at the buffet dinner-party they gave at
Menzies’. Guests-of-honor were the
Indian High Commissioner to Australia,
Mr. K. S. Duleepsinhji and the Kaorani
Duleepsinhji, whose lovely black chiffon
sari was worn over a black chiffon gown
encrusted with iridescent beading. Mr.
Gollan’s gown of black Frenche crepe
had hip-draping which tied at the waist
over a front panel of pleats and a yoke
braid-embroidered and studded with
rhinestones ; white-spotted veiling misted
her small black hat. Mrs. S. P. Schubart,
wife of the Australian Trade Commis-
sioner in Bombay, helped in receiving
guests in a green-and-bronze-striped tie-
silk ballerina frock and a tiny cloche of
black velvet trimmed with toning green
ribbon. Rup Kumari, who is studying
medicine here, wore a beautiful black
sari edged with a heavy border of gold-
and-green embroidery.
From Sydney
Page the poets to describe the pre-race
ball given by the Governor for his
daughter Elizabeth! The moon rose
first golden on the water, then flooded the
garden with silver, where the guests
drifted as in a romantic dream —their
dresses all filmy, graceful and flowerlike.
Slender Juliet Winchcombe, ethereal
Barbara Saxton, pretty Trixie McGirr,
Anne McCauley in midnight-blue star-
sprinkled with apple-blossom, her sister
Prue in white with a red, red rose,
Jennifer Street in a devastating gown of
blue-grey faille, were a few of the moon-
moths floating in the valse. The young-
married set were strongly represented,
Peter and Dorothea Yates, the Noel Vin-
cents, John and Nona Kearney, Beatrice
and Tom Bateman, Clive and Pat Hall,
Peter and Margot Chambers, Diana Ross-
Gore chic in black-and-white organdie as
she danced with her husband. The night
had the lyric charm of an old-world
picture.
This romantic atmosphere, lingering to
the Epsom next day, led your sentimental
Letter into backing Remember Me, Auld
Acquaintance, Fellowship and the like.
None of them came in. The weather-man
obligingly provided plenty of dust so that
the brave new dust-coats had a chance to
prove their worth (these were mentioned
here some weeks ago as a fashion likely
to succeed). More about racecourse
dressing after Ladies’ Day. In the mean-
time, navy and white was the outstanding
color-combination, shantung the winning
material.
Mezzo-soprano Irene Huff will give a
recital with pianist Igor Hmelnitsky at
the Newcastle City Hall tomorrow.
Irene, who has already given many
recitals throughout Australia, will sing at
Aibury, Wagga and Melbourne before she
leaves for further study in Vienna next
year. She also hopes to visit Nhill
(Victoria), where she was born. An
associate of Melbourne Conservatorium,
Irene has established a school of singing
and voice production at Palings’, Sydney.
Her object in going abroad is to enable
herself to pass on knowledge of the most
advanced methods of voice production
to her students.
When Madame Roberto Regala, wife
of the Minister for the Philippines, pre-
sided at the meeting arranged to re-
establish the Pan-Pacific Women’s Associ-
ation, she looked like an exquisite
Christmas-tree fairy, dressed in white
organdie printed with violets. Neverthe-
less she conducted the meeting with
great poise and confidence. An
address on the problems which arise
from contacts between various peoples
of the Pacific was given by that learned
lady with the lovely name, the Hon.
Camilla Wedgwood. Although Miss
Wedgwood’s remarks were rather mis-
understood by some of the audience, the
truth of her finely-drawn analysis was
quite evident to this Letter. She pointed
out that there were many differences in
ideals, outlook and ethical codes among
the peoples of the Pacific ; for instance,
to us everything that is new and modern
seems therefore right, while to many
others a new thing should be regarded
with suspicion. It is our duty to try to
lessen the strain caused by these differ-
ences, through learning more about other
Pacific peoples, endeavoring to see things
from their point of view and being less
arrogant about the rightness of our own
ways.
Whatever one may think of boxing as
a sport, the news of a world champion
laid low must always be depressing.
However, the gloom cast by the defeat
of Joe Louis last week was dispelled by
a preview of M.-G.-M.’s production of
“Annie Get Your Gun,” an irresistible
cheerer-upper with dynamic Betty Hutton
proving that you can’t get a man with a
gun, especially if you can shoot it
straighter than he can.
It needs a pretty smart committee to
think up a new idea for a hat-parade at
this time of the season, but this is just
what the Anti-T.B. committee did when
they staged their “Headlines and High-
balls” cocktail-party at Kinneil. The
hats, bearing such names as Desire,
Fairytale, Emperor Valse, Female
Approach and Rendezvous, were worn
in living pictures posed by society maids
and matrons. The frames for the pictures
had been arranged by Mrs. C. H.
Canfield, some as a gallery and one as
a full-length tableau of an after-races
cocktail group. Hal Missingham arranged
the Randwick group, which included
three top-hatted young beaux in morning
suits, several beauteous racegoers and
Darby Munro. The guests at the cocktail-
party, after they had viewed the pictures,
the hats and the posers, could then buy
votes for their fancy. The voting was
chalked up on a sort of tote-card by
Arthur Browning, the favorite rising and
falling as the voting continued. Fortu-
nately no heartburning was caused by
the result, as Darby Munro romped in
ahead of the field.
Mrs. R. Carmichael looked a
perfect picture in a hat of many
layers of white and black tulle.
Mrs. Howard Hudson wore a cock-
tail hat with flowers cascading down
the side. Primrose Anderson-Stuart of
the tranquil gaze lent charm to a black
velvet cap with a diamond on the crown
and another on the veil. Mrs. Phillip
Yeates wore a sailor hat of red, raffia-
like paper, with a remarkable dress of
red-lacquered satin, finely tucked length-
ways on the bodice, accordion-pleated in
the double-tiered skirt. Mrs. Don
Service’s hat, Parapluie, was more like a
black inverted lily than an umbrella.
Fairytale, worn by Mrs. C. Parsons,
was a tiny Dutch cap of white guipure
lace, and Papillon, a French model by
Paulette, made a shimmering black
dragon-fly of its wearer, Mrs. J. O.
Bovill. Many dashing hats were worn
by the guests, but the crush and the com-
petition were just a bit too much for
them.
A real art gallery was the setting for
a cocktail-party given by the Royal Art
Society at the Education Department.
Flere Eric Langker and Mrs. Langker
(like a snow queen in white crepe) gave*
a welcoming hand to the guests. People
stood looking at Mrs. L. Lister thinking
it was her portrait, and vice versa. The
painter of the portrait, Hayward Veal,
brought along Mrs. Veal, all black velvet
and bare shoulders. Lady Braddon
gyrated round the guests with her usual
easy charm. The Minister for Education
and Mrs. Heffron cast a sympathetic and
appraising eye at the paintings. Mrs. M.
Cordia wore a cameo pendant with her
sleek black dress. Dora Toovey, Douglas
Pratt, Lyall Trindall, Byram Mansell (with
wife and son Peter), Mrs. George Duncan,
Theo Roughley (talking about tuna-
fishing), the Alec Whites, the R. C. Winns
and Dick Windeyer were all present.
Everyone admired A. D. Colquhoun’s
portrait of a little girl. It was a pleasant
and friendly evening.
The ex-students’ association of Sancta
Sophia College will hold a dinner-dance
at the Pickwick Club on Thursday,
October 19, to raise funds for a scholar-
ship to the college. It should prove a
happy reunion for ex-students and their
friends, especially the country folk, who
get few opportunities to renew old
acquaintances.
The schoolchildren’s poster exhibition
at David Jones’, advertising the November
Fete for the Crown-street Women’s
Hospital, was pleasant and colorful. The
Willoughby Domestic Science High School
carried off the laurels for energy and
quantity, Ascham for technique and
Kambala for originality. Matron Shaw,
0.8. E., opened the exhibition, bringing
with her the most interesting of the guests.
This was Miss Wendy Badger of Crow s
Nest, who wore white muslin, lace and
blue ribbon. Now 10 months old and
very winning, Wendy weighed only one
and a half pounds when she was born
at Crown-street Hospital. Today she is
the happiest, healthiest baby one could
see. It’s no wonder the hospital is proud
of her.
A pianoforte recital by Violet Ewart
will be given at History House on Thurs-
day, October .12, at 8.15 p.m. Miss Ewart,
who is an artist of distinction, will play
Bach, and will also include works by
contemporary English composers. The
plan for this recital is open at Palings.

PERSONAL ITEMS
The British Defence Ministry gets a
good man in Alan Moorehead for its
new chief public-relations officer. Born
in Victoria 40 years ago, B.A. from Mel-
bourne University, Moorehead has mixed
with fighting men on most of the world’s
battle-fronts, since, in 1935, he left Mel-
bourne “Herald” to report for London
“Daily Express” on the fighting in Spain.
Foreign-corresponding in France, Italy
and the Balkans brought him up to War
ll—he turned in some of the war’s best
reporting from the Middle East, North
Africa and Italy, and saw the end in
Germany in 1945. In between he put
seven books between covers, nearly all
of war and the men who fought it, and
in his The End in Africa (1943), covered
a big tank battle in a North African wadi
from a flanking hill with some of the
finest descriptive narrative War II pro-
duced.
Energetic enough to make uranium
envious, Major-General James Harold
Cannan, D. 5.0., “retired,” at 68 takes
on the chairmanship of Queensland's
Advisory Recruiting Committee. In
1942 he took over from General Smart
the responsibility of Australian Q.M.G.,
heavy enough even before the Yanks
arrived. Cannan spent most of his week-
ends studying at military classes before
and after War I, in which he had an
excellent record —Gallipoli and then
commander of the 11th Australian
Infantry Brigade in France. Born in
Townsville (Q.), he was the youngest
lieut.-colonel to command a battalion on
his arrival in Egypt in 1915, and was
“mentioned” eight times. Insurance-co.
manager by profession between wars, he
did a tiptop job after the Tokyo
surrender directing U.N.R.R.A.’s efforts
in the S.-W. Pacific for a year. Inter-
State oarsman and lacrosse player when
he was younger, he still golfs, in between
racing three neddies.
Judge Reginald Schofield Bonney, who
has passed on in Sydney, went, via Sydney
High and Sydney University, to the Bar
by 1907; then he conducted a wide
practice in equity jurisdiction, appear-
ing before the Privy Council in the
big paper-sacks case in 1935. For years
a member of the Bar Council, he had
been president of the Law Council of
Australia. Made judge in 1940, he was
67 at the end.
“Trinco” on a man of dollars:
Stepping-down from the highly-exacting job
of bossing the Economic Co-operation Admin-
istration —the agency established to execute
the Marshall Plan—Paul Gray Hoffman, who
for over two years has had the heavy responsi-
bility of screening the “shopping lists” of the
16 recipient nations, and deciding how and
where the astronomical sums of dollars in his
till can be used to Europe’s advantage. By
the day E.C.A. opened for business a flood of
some 10,000 applications for aid had reached
Washington h.q.; and before that day was over
Hoffman had initialled relief commitments for
21 million dollars. Since April, 1948, he has
hammered together a small but highly efficient
team of experts and established headquarters in
six foreign capitals, handed out billions of dollars
in cash and goods, and weathered nine appear-
ances before Congressional committees (all very
tax-conscious) without once being denounced or
jolted from his perch of cool self-assuredness.
But then all his business life since 1911 had
been spent with the Studebaker Corporation,
which he spark-plugged through receivership in
the mid-thirties and of which he’s been president
since 1935. He went over to E.C.A. at just
under one-fifth of his Studebaker salary. Now
59, and taking on the directorship of the philan-
thropic Ford Foundation, Hoffman started as
a car salesman.
A Sydney man, William John Bunney,
chief-officer of the Changsha, has won
the Bronze Medal for Gallantry in saving
life at sea. Sighted near Amoy, on the
Chinese coast, a fishing-boat waterlogged
in heavy seas with six men aboard ; over
on a bowline went Bunney, and in be-
tween being half-drowned, half-frozen
and constantly bashed against Changsha’s
steel plates, got lines round five of the
fishermen. The day before Bunney’s
award was announced young Allan
Preston died in a Grafton (N.S.W.) road
accident. Preston had recently been
awarded the Royal Shipwreck and
Humane Society bronze medal for bring-
ing in a small boy from the swollen
Clarence River.
Medico Murray Falconer, head of the
neuro-surgical department of Dunedin
public hospital (M.L.), left for the Old
Country the other day to take on the
very big job of directing the combined
neuro-surgical units of Guy’s, the Royal
Bethlehem and Maudsley Hospitals in
London. Born in Otago 40 years ago,
Falconer made neuro-surgery his par-
ticular interest after leaving Otago Uni-
versity, and laid the groundwork for his
recent selection by research and study in
England, Germany and France. War II
found him in England, where, major,
R.A.M.C., he served as a specialist at St.
Hugh’s Military Hospital.
Grounded arms for good at 75, Brig.-
General E. F. Martin, Sergeant-at-Arms
of Westralia’s Legislative Assembly for
the past 18 years. One of the original
area officers under the • compulsory-
training scheme in N.S.W., he was
major in command of an infantry
battalion of the force which occupied
German New Guinea in 1914. The next
year he landed on Gallipoli in command
of the 17th Battalion, and ended the war
boss of the sth Brigade—spearhead of the
attack on Mont St. Quentin in 1918. The
German position was captured, although
it was defended by two crack regiments of
the Prussian Guards, an operation which
Fourth Army commander Rawlinson later
described as the “finest single feat of the
war.” General Martin came to Perth in
the early ’twenties on a job with the Elder
Smith people. Early in War II he helped
to organise and train a unit of the Perth
V.D.C. in Perth. He still looked a soldier
to the end,
Percy Lindsay, oldest member of the
famous clan and, as well as a long-
standing Bulletin humorist, one of Aus-
tralia’s finest landscape-painters, got
knocked over by a motor-bike recently
and, with a broken jaw, gave himself
much pain and his friends much anxiety.
Latest reports are that he is fitter than
ever and painting again in his North
Sydney studio.
Among the thousands of farmers who
invaded Melbourne for the Diamond
Jubilee Show was Archer Wilkinson, here
presented, whose farm nestles in the
shadow of Maldon’s (Vic.) Tarrengower.
Born at Bright, where his father, later
one of Collins-street’s leading specialists,
first practised, Wilkinson the younger has
been for 30 years a life member of the

R.A.S. and an inter-State exhibitor and
judge of horses. Scout-pilot with the
A.F.C. in War I and a staff squadron-
leader in War 11, he hauled the German
Messerschmitt plane round Victoria re-
cruiting for the R.A.A.F., and as a
member of the officer entry board visited
most parts of Australia and the islands.
Milker of his own cows, plougher of his
own fields and collector of his own wool

farmer,
The gentleman here presented came
quietly into The Bulletin office,
said his name was Belcher, sug-
gested cautiously that a mention
on this page could possibly help
him to find old friends, on inquiry men-
tioned that he’d just touched-down from
Nairobi, and said in passing that a glance

magistrate, Zanzibar judge, Nyasaland
Attorney-General and High Court judge,
and Chief Justice of courts as widely-
separated as Trinidad and Cyprus. Just
before retiring in 1937, Sir Charles had
been president of the West India Appeal
Court. Hitler’s war drew him back into
harness, to be on several important
Kenya inquiry commissions, and end
the war chief legal adviser to the East
African military command. Son William,
now an engineer in Kenya, was an
observer with Coastal Command in War
II (Bay of Biscay his territory), and in
the Spanish civil war was a sergeant with
the Republicans. Now 74, and chairman
of the Nairobi Rent Control Board,
Sir Charles hobbies at ornithology—his
two books indicate the scope of his
know-how in this field; Birds of the
District of Geelong (1914) and Nyasaland
Birds (1930). He goes back to Kenya
after a few months in Melbourne.
“H.A.L.”: One of the last of the
notable achievements of the late C, M.
Hambidge (B. 13/9/’5O) was to form a
historical section of the South Australian
branch of the Royal Geographical
Society, his idea being that many facts
connected with the early days of colonisa-
tion and development are lost when
older people die without putting what
they know on record. The section was
a success from its inception; many
interesting papers have been read before
its members about the early days of their
own State. It also led to items of his-
torical interest being sent to Alec Chis-
holm for the new edition of the Aus-
tralian Encyclopedia, which he is edit-
ing for Angus and Robertson.
“Clem Lack”; Passed on in Southport
(Q.), J. H. S. Barnes, who made the name
of Canning Downs, near Warwick,
known throughout the Commonwealth
as a racing- and stud-stable. Born at
Dyrabba station in northern N.S.W. 78
years ago, the fine old horseman bought
Lyndhurst station in north Queensland
in the early ’nineties, sold it about 1902
and established his stud at .Canning
Downs with the imported Highfield as
sire. From him came Highland, a Strad-
broke Cup winner, and High Syce,
winner, of the 1929 Caulfield Cup. Also
bred there was Rivoli, Canning Downs
is intimately connected with the romance
of pioneer-settlement in the north. Be-
fore Barnes took it over, the previous
owners, Gilbert and Walter Davidson, in-
troduced Peruvian llamas because of the
slump in wool prices and the high price
mohair was fetching in Europe, Jack
Howe, father of the famed Jackie Howe,
champion shearer, undertook to shear the
beasties. He’d no sooner got going than
the outraged foreigner spat a copious
draught of saliva over and through the
shearer’s luxuriant black hair, which he
wore long in the fashion then current.
After a long and vigorous shampoo
Howe went back to work, but this time
with his target muzzled in a nose-bag.
Also from Canning Downs comes the
promising three-year-old of the same
name, son of Rivoli and an entry for the
coming A.J.C. Derby in Sydney.
“C. 8.”: In Charles Ward, 0.8. E.,
lounge-barman in the Strathmore, pas-
sengers, if they are old theatregoers, will
recognise Charlie Ward, once one of the
premier laugh-makers on the Tiv. circuit.
Before the turn of the present century he
was one of the celebrated Bricklayers of
the Boystown troupe, and toured Europe
with them ; he appeared in the silents
with Charlie Chaplin. Taking to steward-
ing on the high-seas in 1906, he made his
first Australian landfall in the Medina in
1912, and he hasn’t stopped visiting these
shores since. His barrage of ribbons
was won in the 1914 war, and he gained
his 0.8. E. for sticking in charge of a
petrol-store in the Strathnaver in
October, 1941, when the ship was target
for an all-day bombing in North African
waters.
Director of Reserves of Maoriland's
Air Force, Group-Captain T. W. White,
has retired after 34 years’ service in the
organisation. In Canada tutoring young
ML. airmen to grapple in the central blue
with Hitler’s cohorts, White, as air-
attache to the M.L. Minister at Ottawa,
returned to a series of conferences by the
International Civil Aviation Organisation
in 1947. Wing-Commander B. S. Nicholi
takes over.
Dead in Sydney at 78, Percy Charles
White, son of the Charles White who
wrote a string of popular and authentic
histories of the bushrangers. Percy’s tall,
dignified figure and gentlemanly manners
graced Sydney’s business and social
world for 50 years. He came from
Bathurst, where his father had been a
magistrate and newspaperman, and, with
the late Percy Marchant, founded “The
Farmer and Settler” in 1905. Five years
earlier they had established Marchant
and Co., printers. During the past few
years Percy had been preparing some of
his father’s books and historical data for
publication.
Into the Silence:
In Melbourne, at 82, Arthur Duncan Collins,
former manager of the “Herald” and “Weekly
Times” and advertising executive of the “Sun
News-Pictorial.”
In Sydney, Dame Mary Cook, widow of
knight Joseph Cook, 1913-14 Prime Minister. A
particularly hard worker for charity, Dame
Mary was awarded her D.B.E. in 1925 for con-
sistently solid work for the Australian Red
Cross, of which she had been for years vice-
president.
At Kensington Palace, London, the Dowager
Marchioness of Milford Haven, Earl Mount-
batten’s mother and grandmother of the Duke
of Edinburgh.
In Melbourne, Gerald Kirby, one of J.C.W.’s
best-known producers, who first came from
England with “Our Miss Gibbs,” went back,
and returned to Australia in 1939 to produce
regularly for the Firm. His last important job
was “Streetcar Named Desire.”
In Perth, at 58, Arnold Wheatley, one of the
pioneers of the motion-picture industry in West-
ralia. Starting in the days of the silent short-
reelers, he switched to the publicity side in
1917, as publicity-manager for knight Thomas
Coombe’s movie interests. Lately he had been
publicity manager for the Grand Theatre Com-
pany, specialising in British films.
In Sydney, at 91, Richard Hickson, one of
Sydney’s oldest printers. Irishman, trained in
America, he came here 70 years ago and for
45 years ran his own printing concern. Before
the days of linotypes he was a Bulletin frame-
holder, and, as overseer of the Parramatta
“Mercury” in the late ’eighties, trained many
other good Bulletin men—George Skelton,
Alex Dunlop, Percy Booth and Mat Harris.
Hickson instituted the Sydney “texts in trams
and ferries” mission, and was a fine pulpit
speaker.


NOT PAID to THINK
by MERVYN SKIPPER
THE manager looks me up and down
and says: “You’re not paid to
think.”
“If I am not paid to think,” I say,
“what am I paid for?”
The manager rubs his hand over his
bald head, then turns to the little
wizened native clerk and says: “Bobjee,
has that vacancy been filled in
Singapore?”
A week later, as like as not, I will re-
ceive my orders to proceed to that place ;
or perhaps it will be Manila, Hong Kong
or some godforsaken spot up a tidal creek
in Cochin-China. In this way I have been
passed to and fro about the world, some-
what like a parcel, front Australia to
Singapore, from Singapore to Java, from
Java to Borneo or the Philippines. And in
each place I have usually met gentlemen
in authority who at some time or other
are bound to tell me that I am not paid
to think. There was a time when, hearing
this familiar phrase, I would swallow my
rage and ask myself: If lam not paid to
think, are they paid to think? And
if they are not paid to think, who does the
thinking for the vast complex of business
and commercial relations in which for
the past fifteen years I have been en-
meshed? To these questions I have no
answer, and, in fact, I have long since
given up the attempt to find an answer,
though anybody can see that there is
somebody who does the thinking for us
and that his thinking is capable of im-
provement in a vast number of
particulars.
“You’re not paid to think!”
After these interviews I go back to my
bedroom and commence pacing up and
down. I think about the causes of the dis-
pute which has led to me being hauled on
to the carpet and cannot for the life of
me see wherein I have been wrong. I
speculate on the motives of the manager
for singling me out for his contempt and
can find plenty ; but they don’t seem to
justify his behavior at all. These thoughts
exhaust me, and soon I am yawning,
stretching my arms and looking towards
my bed.
But I remember I have to write my
weekly letter home. I sit down at my
table and take up my pen. From beneath
my feet comes a soft whirring sound,
every now and then there is a subdued
crash as if a chair has overturned and
then the hum of voices talking drowsily.
These sounds come from the office below
ijay bedroom. Through the half-open
doorway comes an irregular slap-slap, as
of a flag flapping in an intermittent
breeze. This comes from the seawall
opposite my quarters.
lAM what is known as a submarine-
telegraphist, but I don’t work under
the sea. I work on islands, in bays, at the
heads of harbors and the mouths of rivers,
where ocgan liners pass daily to and fro,
on coral atolls inhabited by simple native
fisher-folk; and sometimes I may be
found half-way up a business building in
the heart of a great Euro-Asiatic metro-
polis. And all these places I have found
beautiful to begin with. Again and again
a fresh transfer,, has aroused in me the
same delighted interest and anticipation,
the same romantic illusions which I felt
when I was first “ordered east.” I am
carried away by the charm and novelty of
a fresh locality, by the uniqueness of its
color, by the variety and strangeness of
the native crowds, even of the smells and
sounds; they entrance me and fill me
with bewildered yearnings and grandilo-
quent ideas. I immediately start learning
the local dialect.
But, seen in the light of my adolescent
dreams, it has been all useless beauty to
me. Sometimes I used to get out the
paints I still carry; or I would take up
my pen: for suddenly I feel myself cap-
able of transferring the whole of it, in one
gigantic sweep, on to canvas or paper or
into a book in some form.
But I have given that up long ago. I
have even given upi making excuses. As
for other people who may have had high
hopes of me, I no longer talk to them
about such things; though even today
the ideas sometimes flood my mind and
the feeling of power returns. I think and
I feel without bothering to bring out my
paints or pick up my pen.
As for my positive achievements, I
have “sent” and “received” perhaps a
matter of ten million messages and sat in
one office or another a, matter of twenty-
seven-thousand hours. It is in my record,
carefully kept by my company. There you
will also see recorded the number of
errors I have made—a respectable but not
brilliant record, by the way—and not only
that, you will see precisely how many
dollars and pounds and guilders I have
drawn for doing it, how much has been
deducted in fines, in allotments of various
sorts, including debts to tradesmen I have
omitted to pay, how much I have re-
mitted to my family, what my pension
will amount to when I am retired at
fifty-five; then there are the tips to
stewards and luggage-porters and my
wine allowance of a shilling a day, for
while I am travelling my company likes
me to maintain ihe status of a gentleman ;
in the record, too, is the story of my many
sicknesses and how much it cost my em-
ployers to get me well; and finally there
are my insubordinations, which have been
comparatively few. And, no doubt, you
will see, scattered through the part of my
record marked “confidential,” remarks
by my various managers concerning my
character, my official zeal, whether I use
my spare time to improve myself or in-
terest myself in young ladies too much
fop efficiency—whether, for instance, I
have been casting eyes at some Eurasian
girl who, perchance, might ensnare me
in matrimony and lower the prestige of
the service in the eyes of white society.
My company is paternal, you see. I
enjoy the acme of security and can look
forward to a comfortable retirement.
Meanwhile, very little effort is required of
me.
These are my positive achievements in
the eyes of my company, and when I look
at myself honestly I have to confess they
are the only achievements I can talk
about. It is also true that I have got on
fairly well and my salary has gone up by
annual increments until it now amounts
to quite a respectable figure, though not
enough to allow me to think of marriage
yet, or freedom—whatever freedom is.
BUT what is not in my record, because
it can’t be proved, is that, although I
was once full of enthusiasm, for years
past I have not done a hand’s turn more
than I could avoid. I have long ceased to
do aught but despise this company which
has given me all this security, and most
of my time is spent in vilifying it and dis-
cussing with every visitor who comes to
our mess the advantages of being a tea-
planter, rubber-assistant or coffee-over-
seer —anything, in short, but a tele-
graphist. So much is this so that I should
have to tell myself that there was some-
thing extraordinary in my character if it
were not for the fact that the vast
majority of my colleagues occupy them-
selves in precisely the same way.
And another thing that is not in my re-
cord is what I must consider my most im-
portant occupation. That is my endeavor
to make up for all the sleep I have lost
in the last ten years or so. You see, I
live always by the clock, for my duties
require my appearance at my desk at
fixed but different hours by day or
night. My sleep used to be deep and re-
freshing even when I had to sleep by day
and even when I was surrounded on all
sides by noisy and indifferent colleagues
more robust than I. But now, when I set
my alarm and place it beside my bed, I
look at it with horror and disgust, as if it
were not the seconds but drops of my
lifeblood its ticking was measuring. I lie
down and try to sleep, but the ticking
grows every minute louder and more
insupportable. The furniture and the
floorboards emit loud and disconcerting
cracks, I can hear a colleague moving
about in the room next door, a bird
chirps or the native watchman clears his
throat with a sound like the cough of a
whale. When the time comes for me to
get up I fancy I have not slept at all, and
when the alarm goes off like an angry
voice I reach out my hand, pick up the
clock and hurl it against the wall. I
don’t know how many clocks I have
wrecked in this way.
I have almost finished my letter when a
sudden tempest of shouts and laughter, as
if a company of merrymaking gods had
dropped from the sky, breaks out at the
front porch, mixed with the whine of
rickshaw coolies begging for their fares.
The quarters resound with the tramp of
feet, heavy objects crash on the floors,
there is a sound of breaking glass and
presently from every bedroom come cries
of “Boy, b-o-y!” followed by the patter-
ing of naked feet. My companions have
returned from their club and brought
home a few friends.
I drink on occasions, but this is one of
my periods of abstinence, so I wait till the
uproar has subsided and I know that
dinner has begun.
MY place is at the head of the table in
our mess, for I have recently been
elected mess-president. This honor
carries with it nothing but the privilege
of listening to the thoroughly well-
grounded complaints of my colleagues
about the food, which,, nevertheless, they
eat ravenously; of dismissing the cooks
when the complaints become too violent,
and engaging new opes who seem to have
graduated from precisely the same school
of cookery; and of otherwise exercising
the functions of housekeeper in a situation
where nothing effective can ever be
achieved against the passive resistance of
the entire Asiatic race. It is also my duty
to act as host to the guests my colleagues
bring along—planters, district officers,
police-inspectors and clerks like ourselves.
These guests may vary from time to time,
but there is one thing in which they are
invariable —that is, their prejudices and
ideas; their likes and dislikes, their
manners and customs are exactly similar
to our own.
Our dinners always proceed in the same
way. First we start talking generally and
there is usually a lot of scandal about our
talk. Then somebody starts an argument
on some scientific question such as the
maximum speed of aeroplanes; or per-
haps it will be politics. The scientific
question could be settled in a moment by
reference to an encyclopaedia—there is a
good one in the station library. But that
would spoil the game; and, although the
discussion reveals the same circle of not
very elevated ideas, the same class and
racial prejudices, we go on arguing long
after the last course has been removed,
the coffee and liqueurs have been drunk
and, yawning and whispering, all but one
of the servants have gone off to bed ; the
last stands motionless and expressionless
behind my chair, waiting for us to dis-
perse. Finally the talk takes on a bawdy
tone.
When we disperse it is to go to our
several rooms, though sometimes, to fend
off the menace of the night, we go to that
lesser menace the cinema.
Or suddenly, throwing down our
napkins and draining a last glass, we go
on to the front porch and bawl for rick-
shaws. Out of the darkness of gigantic
trees jumps a row of coolies, and, picking
up their trammels, they run up to us with
expectant smiles. We get in and one of
us shouts the name of a certain O Hatsa
San, and at the name the coolies look
round at us with grins. We are carried
swiftly through the sleeping town, the
rubber wheels hissing along the bitumen.
and suddenly turn into a dark street.
Mounting to a brightly-lighted room with
white-washed walls and cane furniture
we sit and wait for the matron to send in
three or four young girls
Whichever house we go to it is always
the same thing. There is the same bead-
curtain on the door, the same brightly-
lighted room, the same whitewashed
walls; and the muslin on the windows
seems to have been cut all from the same
piece of material. When the girls come in
it will be found that some are arrayed in
kimonos and some in short European
frocks with immense pink sashes. Under-
neath each frock sticks out a pair of short,
pink-stockinged legs. They sit down and
talk and sometimes one will strum a
samisen, while another will sing in an ex-
traordinarily strident voice. Or they will
get up a little play from the ancient Jap-
anese drama, which they act quite pass-
ably.
But soon they begin to yawn and look
at us significantly. The matron comes in
and asks us if wet would like some stout
or some native champagne, and we look
at her long wooden face and laugh and
shake our heads. We go on talking
awkwardly to one another for a time.
Then, laughing explosively, we make for
the street, loudly asserting we will come
another time. We get into our rickshaws
and return to the quarters, where the
rooms are in darkness, except for the
office where a white man and a Eurasian
can be seen drowsing opposite each other
at their instruments.
ON this island of ours there are plenty
of Eurasian girls. If we mix with
them too openly or invite them to our
mess, however attractive or intelligent
they may be, the manager sends for a
member of the staff and, looking at him
with a stern expression, says:
“You don’t look well. We’ll have to
send you somewhere where the climate is
healthier.”
There are a few unmarried white girls
on the island, too ; but those who are re-
garded as most desirable, unfortunately,
are far above us —either they are too well-
bred, as the saying goes, or their fathers
are Government officials of the higher
ranks or businessmen on bigger salaries
than we.
These girls may be seen on occasions
running about our tennis-courts at the in-
vitation of our manager’s wife. For some
reason or other we don’t join them, but
sit on our veranda, in our native sarongs,
and watch them, laughing loudly when a
ball is hit too hard and flies over the wall
into the sea.
Every fourth year we are granted leave
of absence, so someone is always going
on furlough or returning therefrom.
These are gala occasions, as are the times
when a new man arrives. He becomes the
centre of interest, is asked a million
questions, and tells us what was on at the
theatres in Sydney or London. The
quarters overflow with love and affection,
even the cook feels it, and prepares us a
special dinner. Then we stand round the
piano and sing, but only in chorus, be-
cause nobody has any talent, and the
evening usually ends by beer being poured
into the instrument. After a few days the
new hand has learnt our ways; we have
learnt his, and the evening is forgotten.
I have myself returned from leave for
the third time, but when it comes round
again I will once more feel restless, start
talking about the need of a change, com-
mence looking at the family-photos and
that of the girl I am engaged to and buy-
ing curios. Yet if you asked me what
happened' when I was last on leave I
would say:
“Nothing worth mentioning!”
All told, I have unpacked my boxes
and set up my household gods in seven-
teen different stations, and it has always
been the same thing. I know what to ex-
pect when I approach a fresh locality,
when I meet a fresh colleague I know
what I will hear, and whenever I do
something that displeases my manager,
whoever he may be, I know that I will
say: “I thought” and his reply will
be:
“You’re not paid to think, my friend!”
It was the same at the last station I was


at, it is the same in this, and it will be the
same in the next. Sometimes I ask myself
why life repeats itself so endlessly and
with so little originality, why I myself am
repeating my life so unoriginally and
endlessly.
But if I were asked how I have got into
this state of mind I would have no
difficulty in finding a vast variety of
reasons —for instance, my evil fortune in
having been forced into a way of life so
alien to my temperament, though who or
what forced me I would find it hard to
explain. For my lassitude and indifference
I would blame the hostility of this or that
superior; or I would accuse this or that
individual of having got in my way at
some crucial point in my career. But I
would not believe in any of these reasons ;
for why I am in my present situation I
really do not know at all, any more than
I know why I have to serve under a
manager whom we nickname the Maltese
Rat, and who finds it periodically
necessary to rush out of his office with a
red and angry face and charge into the
room in which 1 am working, look round
and go silently out again, and then send
the little wizened natiye clerk for one or
other of us in order to shout at him:
“You thought! Who told you to
think?”
ONE afternoon, after one of these inter-
views in which I myself had been con-
cerned, I was standing on the office steps
allowing the wind to blow on my fore-
head in an endeavor to rid myself of the
headache which has been my constant
companion for the last six years, when my
heart suddenly gave an enormous throb
and then seemed to stand still. Passing
slowly in the street below was a limousine,
and in the driving-seat sat a young
woman who, it seemed to me, was of such
astounding beauty that she should have
been driving the chariot of the sun in-
stead of this limousine. She was dark,
with a golden tinge, and her profile
appeared to me to have the Grecian purity
of line. Her long thin yellow fingers
rested on the wheel, and as she passed
she turned her head and stared at me with
a proud but extraordinarily frank and
eager look and a smile came to and
passed across her lips so suddenly that I
was left in doubt as to whether she had
smiled at all.
I stayed looking after her. Whenever
I meet an attractive-looking woman I
always feel two contrary emotions—l am
at one and the same time drawn to her
and have an inexplicable feeling of re-
pulsion—in short, I experience exactly the
same epiotions as when I see my com-
panions drinking. Why this is so I
haven’t the slightest notion, and I fancied
that I had become resigned to it, for it is
a long time since I have bothered about
women or concerned myself about any
feelings I might have towards them.
But now, as I stood looking after the
limousine, I could not say what were the
nature of the feelings which possessed my
soul. The car slowly turned the corner
of the street and I went back to my desk.
I found myself attacking my work with
unusual zest. The instruments around me
glittered brightly in the sun that streamed
through the bamboo of the blinds, their
wheels whirred with an unusually
harmonious sound and the soft murmurs
of the native clerks seemed charged with
a deep significance. One dropped a book
on the floor, and this, too, seemed some-
how to be significant.
The Maltese Rat was in the office bend-
ing over an instrument. I felt a strong
wish for him to go, for I wanted to in-
quire as to the identity of the dark girl I
had seen driving the limousine. But when
he went and I was left with the Eurasian
clerk I found myself unable to broach
the subject. I felt a curious distaste ; and
it was the same at dinner. I felt a re-
luctance even to mention the incident, and
it was not until the following evening,
after I had spent a sleepless night, that I
began tentatively asking who she was.
THERE were two of them, sisters, and
their father was a pure Hindu, whose
father, a sandalmaker, had, it appeared,
committed a mmder. The boy had been
a witness at the trial, and after the hang-
ing a missionary had taken charge of
him.
To cut a long story short, the boy had
developed a passionate interest in the
law, had qualified for the Bar, acquired
an enormous practice among the natives,
and, by lending the money he so earned at
extortionate interest, had amassed a
fortune, built himself a mansion of
pseudo- Georgian architecture and
married an English governess. He had
sent his daughters to be educated in
England and after eleven years they had
returned to our island, English young
ladies in everything but color, and com-
pletely unaware of the existence of the
racial bar.
Both were talented, and one played the
violin. The old man gave dinner parties
to the Europeans who owed him the most
money, and would sit, in evening-dress, at
the head of a table loaded with crystal
and silver, with a ljutler as black as him-
self, and dressed like an English butler,
standing behind his chair or moving
sedately around the table filling the white
men’s glasses. After dinner, the mother,
a frightened silent woman, and the
daughters would withdraw and the old
man would tell smokeroom stories. Then
there would be dancing in a drawing-room
full of mirrors and period furniture, and
in the mirrors would be reflected in end-
less repetition images of young ladies
held in such close embraces by their
Caucasian partners that they seemed to
be fused into a single organism.
Sometimes the old man would give an
outdoor party and it would always be on
a remote beach visited only by native
fishermen. The servants would lay out a
magnificent repast and afterwards the
white men and the daughters would go
in swimming. But when the men who
owed him money went to concerts or sat
on the veranda of the only club to which
his family were admitted, they would sit
as far away from his daughters as possible
and hope that they would not be
obliged to recognise them.
And there was much else besides, such
as that one of the daughters had ensnared
an English clerk into an engagement and
that he met her clandestinely for fear his
firm would dismiss him; and that the
other was loose in her morals. But 1
ignored all this, regarding it as the ex-
pression of racial intolerance.
ALL this was extraordinarily interesting
to me, and I felt as if a door had been
opened and that through it I saw a new
world of sensations and ideas. I had
never been able to conjure up any clear
conception of a girl of my own race, but
I began to form a vivid picture in my
mind of the girl I had seen in the
limousine. I went to my room feeling
agitated and confused, as if some im-
portant decision were being forced on me.
I wondered whether it was the girl I had
seen who was engaged to the English
clerk, and this seemed to me so important
that I jumped up to go to the messroom
to ask my colleagues.
But I got no further than the door.
“After all,” I thought, leaning against
the door-jamb and gazing towards the
sea, “it doesn’t matter. What matters is
the awful problem of mixed marriages.
There are thousands of such marriages
occurring every day, in every part of the
world. Chinese girls are marrying
Englishmen, negresses Dutchmen, Anna-
mites Frenchmen. And what is worse,
unfortunate women of color are sub-
mitting to the embraces of drunken sailors
in the ports, planters are debauching
mere children in their bungalows. And
what about the offspring of these
unions?”
I began to walk up and down my room.
I felt feverish. From outside came the
flapping, as of a drowsy flag ; from under
my feet came the whirr of the instruments
and the scent of the sea floated in through
the door.
“What of then: ?” I thought. “Out of
the dubious union of an English woman
and a Hindu is evolved a creature of as
fine a grain as the finest of either race.
She is given the education of an English
girl, is brought out to this little trans-
planted hell of European prejudice and
arrogance, by sheer charm and a little
help from her father’s pocket, no doubt,
she wins a place in the local society. But
she is only baring her breast to a blow
that may enter right into her heart.”
And this tragedy seemed terrible, and
as if it had happened to me. For some
reason, I picked up my helmet and stick,
but at the moment I did so, there was the
sound of footsteps in the next room and
my name was shouted. At once I put
them down and sat down again without
answering.
“How can this young woman be
saved?” I asked myself. “One could
marry her oneself and thus protect her
from the advances of some coarse,
whisky-drinking, insensitive European.”
I wiped my face on a towel. I longed to
stop thinking, for I had had these
attacks before. But I could not prevent
my thoughts taking a new turn.
“But if one married this girl it would
not solve the problem of mixed marriages.
While one was marrying her, a brutal
white man would be ruining some other
girl of the same class somewhere else in
the town, perhaps even in the same street.
And ten thousand other white men would
be doing the same thing, all the way from
San Francisco to Port Said.”
“I will write a book,” I thought.
I HAVE dreamt all my life of writing
1 some great book, but 1 have not written
anything as yet except descriptive articles
and stories in which the human element
is so conspicuous by its absence that an
editor once wrote and asked if, in giving
so much space to the scenery, I were not
in danger of depopulating the world.
But now I felt I could write a novel of
so rich a texture, so crowded with ad-
mirable and scoundrelly characters, so
full of poignant incident, that it would
touch a chord of sympathy throughout
the English-speaking world. I thought of
all the half-castes I had known —shop-
keepers and clerks in the various offices
in which I had served to whom I had
never spoken except to issue an order or
make a demand. But now I felt I knew
their very souls, shared their sufferings,
and felt with them the same hatred of
their indifferent Caucasian overseers.
“An innocent native-girl is bought
from her parents by a planter,” I thought,
pacing up and down. “She is fetched to
his bungalow and isi left there like a
trapped animal to await his return. She
looks out of the window and longs to get
away ; but where is she to go? Her parents
have a numerous family and there is sick-
ness in the house and not enough rice. So
she sits down on the bed to wait for the
night and the arrival of the overseer.
“But fortunately,” X went on, sitting
down and beginning to play with my pen,
“he happens to be a man whom a bad
education and racial prejudice have not
altogether brutalised. When he comes
home he is touched by the fear and terror
in her eyes and he goes out and makes up
a bed for himself on the porch. A year
passes and she has a baby. There comes
a night when her cries ring through the
bungalow and are heard by the listening
natives in the coolie lines. The paternal
instinct is independent of race, color or
legitimacy, and the planter rushes dis-
tractedly about, sends messages for the
doctor and sits by the side of the girl and
tries to comfort her. Her agony alters his
preconceived notions on the question of
race, and he realises that from the people
he had called Eurasians and whom he had
formerly regarded as on a par with the
beasts, the same awful shrieks have
rung!
“And after all,” I thought, walking to
■and fro again, “the baby dies, the girl
goes back to her village and the planter
home ; but visitors to the estate are shown
a grave surrounded by a whitewashed
fence! which it is said the planter erected
with his own hands.”
I stopped and looked at a picture of
sailing-ships hanging on the wall, but all
I could see was the lithe body of the girl
I had seen in the limousine struggling in
the grasp of a man whom I recognised as
the Maltese Rat. I was not so much
astounded at the hallucination as dis-
gusted at the thoughts it conjured up. At
all costs, I thought, she must be saved
from a fate like that ; but how? She
could not marry a man of her own race —
she was spoiled for that. If she married a
white man he would be dismissed, her
father would have to keep him, he would
lose his self-respect and probably take to
drink and revenge himself on the girl
herself.
AFTER standing thinking for some
time I picked up my helmet and stick
again and went out. The moon was up
and a light breeze was running across the
silver path on the dark face of the sea.
It was cool enough to make sleeping
pleasant, but I walked down the steps,
crossed the tennis-court and climbed over
the sea-wall.
The tide was out and I could easily
make my way along its foot. The water
lapped beneath my feet, and only some-
times did I have to clutch at the branches
of the trees hanging out from the
gardens that lined the harbor front.
Reaching a beach of black sand I began
to walk along it briskly. A fisherman with
something shapeless on his back blew
loudly on a torch and looked sharply into
my face as he passed. Soon I reached
more dark gardens enclosed in high walls.
Behind one of these walls, in one of these
houses, was the girl 1 had seen in the
limousine.
I stopped and stood still. I was shiver-
ing violently although the air was warm ;
and there was a dull feeling in my head.
Under a row of coconuts was a line of
native boats, and I felt a sudden strong
desire to launch one and sail over the
horizon; but I was shivering more
violently than ever, and the sensation in
my head had become a sharp, continuous
pain. I left the beach and, stumbling be-
tween the trees, came out on the road that
led back to the quarters. I was no longer
shivering, but felt bitterly cold and had
noises in my head and saw lights when I
shat my eyes, and my body felt dry and
hard as if turned to stone as I walked on.
Some time in the morning a black
shadow came to the side of my bed, and
said:
“So that is what it was! You’ve been
talking to yourself all night. I’d better
tell the Maltese Rat.”
Half-an-hour later the manager came.
He thrust his hand under my mosquito-
net, felt my pulse, put his hand on niy
forehead and went away.
A couple of hours later the doctor
arrived, took my temperature, looked at
my tongue, put an instrument to my
chest, said it was malaria and prescribed
quinine. But it was not malaria, and the
next day I was worse, and it was not for a
week that I was able to leave my room.
And then I was too weak to return to the
office and could only take short walks in
the afternoon, while in my head was a
feeling of utter emptiness.
One day the Maltese Raft sent for me,
and said: “I’ve been looking up your
record, mister. You’ve had the same thing
before. The devil, knows what is the
matter with you, but you’re no good to
us here. You’d better go on leave.”
My heart gave a great bound and 1
felt as if a weight had been lifted off my
breast, I wanted to tell him what was
really wrong with me: that the sickness
was not in my head or my stomach, but
in my soul, and that the pain would never
go while places existed where men and
women could be so gross as to cat, drink,
and be merry when so many fellow-
creatures, whose only sin was their birth,
were suffering violence, humiliation and
wrong. But I felt he might laugh at me,
so I thanked him and went away.
A YEAR has passed. I have been on
leave and returned to a new place.
But it is still the same thing, every
familiar detail is there, a manager who
tells us we are not paid to think and even
a piano ruined by beer. I am sitting in
my bedroom warming my feet at a stove
and waiting for my companions and their
friends to come back from their club for
the evening meal. It is snowing, and the
spund of the traffic in the street below is
stilled; only the musical chant of .he
coolies pushing barrows of European
merchandise up from the wharves into
the town can be clearly heard. I have a
fat little tutor and am trying to master
the dialect.
TALK OF THE DEVIL.
One thousand one hundred and eleven
Legions of devils rage against Heaven,
And in every lejfion there exist
Six thousand six hundred and sixty-six.

To regulate the work of the Devil;

Fiends are at work to make mankind

ABOUT CAROLINE.
(4) Talking of Caroline.
“You would not know Caroline now,” |
they said, j
And whispered: “She’s not quite right
in the head.
Her hands flutter, her black hair flies,
The queerest expression lurks in her
eyes;
Her voice is shrill, it dips and quavers.
Moreover . . . such curious clothes she
favors,
Calling her garments ‘Arabian tents ;
They are moth-riddled and torn to
rents.
She tells us—Each hole and every tear
Is a fine silk dress I used to wear.
Her house is a sight, each room is full
Of dust and bric-a-brac . . . pitiful!”
They nodded their heads, but I shook
mine
Confident: “I’ll know Caroline.
She may be mad, though that’s surmise
But I could not fail to recognise
Something about her, a smallest trace
Of her speaking charm or her body’s
grace.
She may, indeed, have lost her wits
But surely her madness her sane self
fits.”
When I went to her house she was at
the gate
Laughing, lovely: “Why should I wait
Between four walls? What has begun
In darkness surely ends in the sun.
Her speech is a subtle kind of song.
Meaning impelled by its strains along
A spiral of sense. No voice I’ve heard
Enhances thus each minute word.
Later they asked: “Was she ill or well?”
“She was Caroline ... I cannot tell.”

IN THE DREAMTIME
The Old Eaglehawk Woman.
By ROLAND E. ROBINSON
mm 7‘ HE legend of Ngaroomba, the old
S eaglehawk woman.
L i In the Dreamtime an old woman
named Ngaroomba lived among
the rocks. This old woman was of the
Maledna tribe and was the mother of
two girls who lived with her.
And the old woman would come out
of her place among the rocks and begin
singing a song. And the two girls would
dance and cause a cloud of dust to go up
into the sky.
One day two boys came along to this
place and saw what they thought was
smoke rising into the sky. Towards
evening the two boys began to come up
to where the girls were dancing. And the
two g rls saw the boys and said to the
old woman, “Mother, here are two boys,”
“Oh,” said the old woman, “you had
better go over and have a talk with them.”
And later the old woman said to the
two boys, “You can camp with us
tonight.” And each boy and girl lay
down together on each side of the fire.
And at midnight the old woman got
up and took a huge stone and with it
killed both of the boys while they slept.
And in the night the two girls woke
up calling to their mother, “Mother, we
want some meat to eat.” But the old
woman said to them, “You must go out
hunting,” and sent them off on a walk-
about.
And when the girls were gone, the old
woman made a ground-oven and cooked
both the boys in it and then ate them
both. And the old woman made her feet
like the pads of a dingo. Then she made
tracks all about the camp and tracks
leading off out of the camp. And when
the two girls came back she told them
that the wild dogs had been and eaten
the two boys.
And the old woman made the girls
dance and raise a c’.oud of dust and
bring many young boys to her camp for
a long time. And the old woman killed
and ate over a hundred blackfellows
in this way.
Now two boys of the Kurrababa
tribe came upon this camp when
the old woman and the girls were
away. And as the two boys were
looking round the camp they saw
many spirits of blackfellows
wandering about. And the two boys
went away out of the camp and
waited until it got late. Then they came
back and were met by the two girls. And
the two girls told them that they could
come into the camp.
And in the night the two boys got up
and put a hollow log alongside each of
the girls. Then they sat apart from the
flickering light of the fire and watched.
And they saw the old woman steal up
with a huge stone between her hands.
And when she came to where the first
girl was sleeping, the two boys leapt out
of the darkness and fell upon her with
their boomerangs.
And before the old wqman was dead,
the elder of the two boys said to her,
“You should not have eaten blackfellows.
You should have eaten goanna, wallaby
or blue-tongue lizard,”
And the two brothers broke up the
old woman with the stone she had
carried. And the old woman afterwards
turned into the eaglehawk.
Then the two brothers said, “We must
turn into flying-foxes.” But to the two
girls they said, “You shall turn into two
crimson-winged parrots, and you shall
fly calling through the trees to feed on
the flowers.”

Dooruk the Emu.
THE legend of Dooruk the emu that
is told in the Djauan tribe.
In the Dreamtime there lived an old
woman called Dooruk. This old woman
was cunning and greedy and would eat
all the food she had without giving any
to the children of the tribe. If she had
found any yams she would pretend they
were bitter and had to remain in running
water for a long time. Then, when the
children were gone, she would take the
yams out of the river and eat them all
herself. Whatever food she had she
would make some excuse so that she
would not have
to give any to the
children.
And the boys
of the tribe de-
cided that they
would teach this
old woman a
lesson. Two boys,
Wark-wark, who
afterwards be-
came the white-
eyed crow, and
Lumbook, who
became the brown
pigeon, made a
plan how to do this.
These two boys went looking for an-
other boy called Jar-waiack-waiack, who
afterwards became the black-and-white
cuckoo-shrike, and whom they now found
sitting under a shady tree.
When the two boys saw him they said,
“We know where there’s a big kangaroo,
old man. Do you want to kill him?”
“No more,” wailed Jar-waiack-waiack.
“I’ve got a sore foot. Can’t you two
fellows kill him?”
But the other two said, “No, we can’t
kill him. We’re too small.”
And Wark-wark said, “Look, you’ve
got a stake in your foot. I’ll take it out
for you and make your foot better.”
“No more,” wailed Jar-waiack-waiack.
“My foot is too sore. I won’t let any-
one take that stake out!”
“Well,” said Wark-wark, “we’ve got
a big kangaroo over there, and we’ve
got to kill him because I don’t
think that old woman Dooruk can
get any tucker, she’s too old.”
Now the old woman Dooruk
was lying asleep under a good
shady tree and did not hear what
was going on.
“Now then,” said Wark-wark,
“I’ll take that stake out of your
foot in no time, and I’ll make your
foot better.”
“All right, then,” said Jar-waiack-
waiack. “Come and try.”
And Wark-wark and Lumbook started
to feel Jar-waiack-waiack’s foot and to
dig about in it.
“Oh, my foot, my foot! Leave it,
leave it!” Jar-waiack-waiack called.
But the other two said, “Now then,
we’ve got to get it out.” And they went
on digging and squeezing, crouching all
the while over Jar-waiack-
waiack’s foot.
Suddenly, the swelling in
Jar-waiack-waiack’s foot burst
and a whiteness spattered
Wark-wark in both his eyes,
and Lumbook on the end of
his nose. “Yakai! Yakai!” they both
cried out.
But Jar-waiack-waiack said, “Oh,
good, good. My foot’s better already.
Where’s that kangaroo now? I’ll be the
best kangaroo-killer of all!”
And when Wark-wark had got over
his surprise he said, “Hey, Lumbook, go
and get that spear belonging to the old
man.”
“Yes,” cried Jar-waiack-waiack. “Go
and get my spear. I’ll kill that kangaroo
right away.”
“Yes,” said Wark-wark. “Everybody
knows what a good kangaroo-killer you
are.”
And soon Lumbook came back with
the spear and off they went. At last Jar-
waiack-waiack said, “Where’s that kan-
garoo?”
“He’s here,” said Wark-wark, pointing
through the grass.
“Watch him now,” said Jar-waiack-
waiack. “I’ll kill him for sure.”
“You don’t want to miss him,” said
Wark-wark. “That old woman can’t get
any tucker, you know.”
“I won’t miss
him,” said Jar-
waiack - waiack.
“You watch me,”
And Jar-
waiack - waiack
stalked up on to
the kangaroo and
speared him. And
Jar - waiack-
waiack danced
about and cried,
“There now. I’ve
paid you for fix-
ing my foot.”
“Oh, yes,” said
Wark-wark. “We
know what a kangaroo-killer you
are.”
And the three boys picked up the big
kangaroo and carried it along to the old
woman’s camp,
“Eh, old woman,” cried Lumbook.
“We’ve got a big kangaroo here.” And
the old woman Dooruk woke up with a
start and, when she saw the kangaroo
that the boys had killed, she tried to get
up, but being only half-awake she fell
down.
“Oh,” she cried, “you’re good boys.
And I know Jar-waiack-waiack is a good
kangaroo-killer, everybody knows him.
I knew you wouldn’t forget the old
woman who reared up all you boys.”
And Wark-wark, Lumbook, Jar-
waiack-waiack and a lot of boys began
to make a hole for the fire and to get
stones and paperbark to cook the
“Eh, old woman,” said Wark-
wark, “what about getting us some
water?”
“Indeed I will,” said the old
woman. “You are good boys for
bringing in that kangaroo.’
And the old woman took up her
coolamon and hurried off to get the
water.
Presently she called out, “Can I get
the water here?”
“No more,” the boys called back.
“That’s too close, the water’s dirty there.”
The old woman went further on, and
as she went she called, “You boys might
eat my kangaroo before I get back.”
“No more,” called back Wark-wark.
“We’ve not started to cook him yet.”
“Maybe you boys are playing about
with me,” the old woman
called.
“No,” they called back.
“We’ll save him for you all
right!”
And the old woman went
on further with the boys
calling out, “Go down to the waterfall.”
“That’s too far,” called back the old
woman.
“No,” they called back, “This kangaroo
will take a long time to cook. He’s a big
kangaroo.”
Then from a long way off came the
voice of the old woman, “Can I get water
here?”
“No, no,” they all called. “You’re too
close.”
Then Wark-wark and Lumbook said
to the other boys, “Come on, you fellows,
hurry up and cook this kangaroo before
the old woman gets back . . . We’ve got
to punish her this time. Hurry up and
get him cooked and then we’ll divide him
11ln 55
up.
Now one of the boys named Kaa-aark
was very anxious to throw the kangaroo
on the fire. “Look out, all you fellows! ”
he cried. “I’ll show you how to put this
kangaroo on the fire.” And Kaa-aark
caught hold of the kangaroo by his hind
and front legs and, straddling near the
fire, gave a great swing and swung the
kangaroo and himself into the fire. Kaa-
aark yelled out “Yakai!” when the fire
burnt him and he struggled, coughing,
out of the smoke. Afterwards he turned
into the black cockatoo, and the red bar
in his tail feathers shows where he was
burnt in the fire.
Faintly now came the voice of the old
woman, “Can I get water here?”
“No,” the boys still called. “You must
go down to the waterfall.”
“Oh, all right,” the old woman called,
and as she went along she talked to her-
self. “I don’t think those boys would eat
that kangaroo. They’re good boys. They
would keep some for me. That’s a big
kangaroo. I couldn’t finish him up
myself.” So she talked to herself all the
time in the way that an emu does.
And at last the old woman reached the
waterfall. She filled her coolamon and
started back. Presently she saw the
smoke of the fire rising out of the tops
of the trees.
“Oh,” she said, “the smoke’s getting
up now. I must hurry, the camp’s not
far off.”
Out of breath and perspiring, the old
woman arrived back at the camp with
the water. But she could see no one
about. The ground-oven where the
kangaroo had been cooked was opened
and empty. There were only the stones,
cracked and heated by the fire, and the
charcoal left.
“Oh,” she began to wail, “where are
all those boys gone? Perhaps they’ve
gone to have a swim, or to get some
water themselves. I know they
can’t leave me behind. I know
those boys can’t leave me here
by myself.”
She began to look for tracks
leading out of the camp, but she
could not find any, for the boys
had brushed them out with bushes
as they left. But suddenly.
as she was looking about in the grass,
something shot up from the ground at
her feet. This was a small boy named
Jirritt-jee, who* had hidden himself in
the grass with a piece of kangaroo’s
tail,
Jirritt-jee shot straight up in the air
with a startled, whirring noise, for this
was where he turned into the brown
quail. When Dooruk saw him she was
so angry that she picked up a pointed
stick and threw it up into the trees after
him. The stick didn’t hit Jirritt-jee, but
went spinning round and round as
Dooruk watched it. Presently it began
to come down straight for Dooruk, and,
before she could get out of the way, the
stick came down and stuck in the middle
of her forehead.
“Ai!” she wailed. “Now I don’t want
to see those boys again. They have
cleared out and left me alone and
hungry. There is only one thing I can
do. I’ll turn into an emu and I’ll go
along the ridges and peck in the grass
for stones. Yes, I’ll turn into an emu
and I’ll go back to my own country at
Gumberin where the waterfall is.”
And the old woman Dooruk became
an emu and went travelling along the
ridges, pecking among the grass and
stones and talking to herself all the while
in the way that an emu does.

Royal Art Society.
If it were not for Mary
Edwards’s self-portrait, so grace-
ful and romantic in concept and
vivid with such lovely greens in
the clothes and background,
about the most memorable pic-
ture in the Royal Art Society’s
exhibition at the N. S. Wales
Education Department Galleries
would be Mary Edwards’s
“Samoan Child,” an excep-
tionally delicate little portrait,
firm as a bronze and set in
exactly the right frame, ob-
viously gold-leafed by the artist
herself. If some of Mary Ed-
wards’s native heads don’t go
beyond the decorative this small
fragile child is certainly alive.
G. K. Townshend is another
established artist whose style
and range of subject-matter
have been familiar for many
years and who yet has something
vital to say: his “Trees at
Gloucester” stands out among
the watercolors as the Mary
Edwardses do among the oils,
and, with its dark-green pines
sensitively observed, is a wel-
come variation on his usual
grey-day subjects.
There are also, with a simi-
lar touch of the freshness that
means life, Lance Solomon’s
“On the Hillside,” A. D. Col-
quhoun’s two portraits, Howard
Ashton’s hard but animated sea-
piece, J. C. Coleman’s “After
Rain, Windsor,” Margaret
Coen’s flowerpiece “The Last of
Summer,” Hayward Veal’s “Sun-
down, Elizabeth Bay,” Percy
Lindsay’s “Willows at Sack-
ville,” Rufus Morris’s water-
color “Sunshower, North Ryde,”
J. Salvana’s “Capertee Valley,”
John Rowell’s “Johnston’s
Creek” and a pencil-drawing,
charming in spite of a strangely
hairy technique, by George
Olszanski.
For the rest, it is the average
Royal Art Society show, such as
we see year after year, with a
sprinkling of attractive minor
paintings—the contributions by
Arthur Wright, Garrett Kingsley,
Leonard Long, David Rabb,
Hilda Townsend, Jean Derrin,
Byram Mansell, Frances D.
Ellis and R. H. Moppett —and
the bulk of the space occupied
by the “popular” paintings of
Robert Johnson, James R. Jack-
son, Eric Langker, Douglas
Pratt, John Allcot, Albert Sher-
man, Alan D. Baker, Dudley
Parker and the curious cold
landscapes of Rubery Bennett
which look as if they had been
observed through a telescope .. .
a level lot of paintings, attrac-
tive up to a point but without
special quality except, perhaps,
in the invariable sturdiness of
Robert Johnson.
The N. S. Wales National
Gallery bought Lance Solo-
mon’s “The Boundary Fence,”
A. D. Colquhoun’s “Alice,” G.
K. Townshend’s “Trees at Glou-
cester,” Eric Langker’s “Sunlit
Hiltfc” and H. Edgecombe’s
“Nerriga Landscape.”
Rufus Morris.
There are three watercolors
by Rufus Morris at Sydney
Grosvenor Galleries which one
would like to see taken away
from the rest of his show and
hung quietly by themselves.
These are “A Study in Greys,
Parramatta River” ; “Afternoon
Light,” a study of shipping in
the industrial parts of the Har-
bor with the precision and
clarity of a Frank McNamara ;
and “The River,” another bit of
industrial water lit with a deli-
cate greenish hue from the
reaches of Harbor mud: all ex-
cellent in drawing, clear and
clean in the washes and—an
artist who can make poetry out
of mud must command any-
body’s respect —sensitive in feel-
ing.
You could add to these, with
admiration for the big problem
of composition he has attempted,
at least the right-hand half of
“Repairing the Ryde Bridge,”
where, while the left side is
meaninglessly bright and empty,
there is a rich statement about
smoke and barges. And, per-
haps, “Headwaters of the Bega
River” could go along with
these.
But mostly when he is away
from the Harbor, Rufus Morris
is too hard, bright, slick and
shallow, A rarity in his way, he
draws too well, lays his wash
down too cleverly ; he needs to
think more and feel more deeply
about his subjects, less about
the style in which he can put
down an approximation of them
on paper. The general effect is
of the bright, colorful illustra-
tions you see in some of the
American magazines, full of
hard edges, sharp and inhuman
as a razor.
It is the same with Rufus
Morris’s paintings at the Royal
Art Society exhibition: two big,
clever, unfeeling watercolors
and one —“The Sunshower” —
with a flash of the real thing in
it.
Travel Notes.
In general, travel narrows the
mind to a merely European and
fashionable view of art, and the
painter who has something to
say and goes abroad is likely
to come back saying only what
everyone else is saying in Paris
and Munich ; but it hardly seems
necessary to suggest, after in-
specting the paintings at Sydney
Macquarie Galleries from Aus-
tralian artists now overseas, that
artists should be refused their
passports. Equally with the gal-
leries full of Old Masters, con-
temporary fashion is a test which
the individual does well to face.
And if Douglas Watson, re-
membered as a solid observer of
slums and landscape, seems to
have succumbed to a phase of
painting old forts in Marseilles
in a style as insubstantial as pink
ice-cream he may yet come out
of it with profit. Grace Cossing-
ton Smith, on the other hand,
who paints in the harlequin or
lozenge technique, makes more
of an English haystack or a
gorge near Florence than she
was able to make of the more
intricate forms of the Australian
bush —her paintings are very
pleasant in their thin sunshine.
There are some spirited tinted
drawings, pleasing in color, by
Margaret Olley; a smooth
description of some Italian
children by Donald Friend;
some fungi in crude but force-
ful orange and red by Joy
Ewart; very papery drawings in
a vaguely Chinese manner by
Fred Jessup; a dingy bit of
surrealism by David Strachan ;
and two abstract paintings by
Anne Wienholt which leave the
present commentator with com-
pletely abstract emotions.
"The Girl Who Couldn't
Quite."
There is something a bit queer
about this comedy of Leo
Marks, revived at Melbourne
King’s after a successful run at
the Princess, and it isn’t only
the title. To most theatregoers
seeking entertainment the title
would suggest some sex content
—“Up in Mabel’s Room,” or
something of that sort. But it
isn’t a bit like that. It seems to
be trying to be serious about
something.
The girl who couldn’t quite is
Ruth, the daughter of distracted
parents, who can’t make out
why she can’t be quite normal
when, as a matter of fact, she is
having hallucinations. The form
they take is frightful faces peer-
ing in at windows through which
the fog of the Cotswolds is
creeping in an endeavor to de-
vour her. As Bertrand Russell
said, what makes a thing true is
a fact, not a feeling, and there
isn’t any fact to correspond with
the poor girl’s feeling. In short,
it is a psychological case which
would require the genius of a
Freud or a Jung to unravel.
Tim turns up. He is a Cock-
ney hobo, and he finds it just
too easy. He wins the girl’s con-
fidence and dredges out of her
unconscious the horrible experi-
ence of her childhood, which is
the determining factor in her
hallucination. It was a wicked
nurse who made faces at her.
Having been cured of one
obsession she promptly gets
another. She deems her hobo
savior to be a very devil, and
he makes a noble gesture by
taking himself off.
Despite the brilliant acting of
Avril Wheatley, the girl who
couldn’t quite couldn’t quite
make the present writer feel
that she was altogether real, any
more than Clifford Mollison
could convince him altogether
that he could achieve the thera-
peutic miracle alleged, though
he is a thoroughly sympathetic
actor. _
"Androcles and the
Lion. 11
“Androcles and the Lion,”
put on by Brisbane’s Twelfth
Night Theatre, is an old moral
tale “renovated” (to use Shaw’s
own word) into a glittering
comedy, enlivened by the down-
fall of tyrants wifely and Im-
perial, and containing a timely
reminder that revolutionary
movements often attract people
not good enough for already-
established institutions.
James Buchanan as Andro-
cles, Phillip Thompson as the
lion and Freda Little as Meggy,
the shrew, launched the pro-
logue so vigorously that the rest
of the play made good speed in
their wake. It was a pity that
some of the subtle scenes
wherein Lavinia (beautifully in-
terpreted by Mary England) op-
poses her faith to the advances
of the Roman officer were lost
because his proposals were so
wooden as to fail to justify the
passionate replies he received.
James Stevens as Ferrovius,
more Martian at heart than
Christian, and Harold Cox as
Imperial Caesar, forced at lion’s
claw-point to embrace the snivel-
ling and garlic-smelling Androc-
les, made the most of the excel-
lent situations Shaw provided
for them,
Jean Hunter’s production was
at all times delightful.
Opening his Brisbane recital
with a titanic performance of the
Bach-Busoni Prelude and
Fugue in D Major, Gyorgy
Sandor revealed himself as a
complete master of the piano-
forte, and continued to confirm
this judgment with a very satis-
fying version of the Brahms
Variations on a theme of Paga-
nini. Less satisfying were his
romantic readings of Schumann
and Chopin. The showy Liszt
“Rakoczy March” and Falla’s
“Dance of Terror” failed to
glitter as such musical fireworks
should because of his concentra-
tion on speed rather than sheer
clarity. It was a pity that the
main items of the recital were
marred by a wayward string
that required first-aid from a
piano-tuner during the interval.
♦ * * *
The latest of the A.B.C.
Youth Concerts at Melbourne
Town Hall was distinguished by
some solo playing that was far
from youthful. This was in the
“Emperor” Concerto. Manfred
Clynes, a scholarship-winner
who has returned from America
with a reputation, was the per-
former. He played the solo
part of Beethoven’s majestic
opus with a facility and expres-
siveness that haven’t been noticed
on that platform for a long
time. The brilliance of his scale
work in the first movement and
in the cadenza written by the
composer left his virtuosity in
no doubt, but he had reserves of
feeling for the glorious andante,
with its wit, grace and gaiety,
and in the final movement he
rode the orchestra, under
Bernard Heinze, to an exciting
finish which brought loud
applause from the musical
punters assembled on the side-
lines.
* * * *
It was evident at the concert
given in Sydney by the Mobil
Quest finalists that these talent-
finding competitions are having
a most stimulating effect on the
standard of singing. The winner,
Joan Sutherland, has a dramatic
soprano of very good quality,
flexible despite its dramatic
weight in the low regions, with
fine-spun texture in the high
flights —she sang Wagner and
Ponchielli with good dramatic
insight. The runner-up, David
Allen, baritone, sang the “Largo
al Factotum” from “The Barber”
with resonance and a sense of
humor. William Smith’s bass-
baritone was heard to best ad-
vantage in a fine aria from Gou-

THE SERVICE MAN
At the 38th Parallel.
“Ek Dum”; Once ashore at
Inchon, General Mac Arthur
soon made mince-meat of the
North Korean forces everywhere
and of the miserable predictions
and gloom of the 260 corres-
pondents accompanying the
“U.N.O.”—that is, the United
States and British Common-
wealth—forces, no less than of
the correspondent of the London
“Daily Worker,” which supplies
the official Australian Com-
munist organ with such news as
does not come direct from Mos-
cow. The British Attorney-
General, Sir Hartley Shawcross,
said last week in relation to this
hero that though his case in-
volved difficult points of law,
“no one should be in doubt that
the law of treason was applic-
able in connection with the pre-
sent conflict,” and that his ac-
tivities were being closely
watched. A few fifth-columnists
in Australia might take note with
advantage.
From the moment of the
landing there was no doubt
about what would happen to
the North Koreans within a few
days. They were taken com-
pletely by surprise, demoralised
by the heavy bombing—24,ooo
tons on key points—and be-
wildered by the number of land-
ings and drives which they sud-
denly had to counter after a
period during which they were
encouraged to believe by their
own leaders and the United
Nations Press that it was only
a matter of time before they
were in Pusan receiving the sur-
render of Dr. Syngman Rhee
and a few thousand Allied
troops.
In the north round Seoul
their resistance was weak,
though there the Americans
were using only a little more
than the two divisions of the
X Corps, which encountered
only second- and third-rate
troops most of the time, some
of them mere boys. In the
south U.S. and British troops,
though still at first meeting
strong resistance at key points,
were soon able to go wherever
they wished.
Mopping-up Begins
The Seoul fighting could be
described only as mopping-up,
and the drive from the Seoul
area southward to link with the
forces in the defence-box was
put through almost as fast as it
was prudent to move. With that
linkage the Korean war south
of the North Korean border for
all practical purposes ended.
As early as September 18
General MacArthur said that the
North Koreans were handling
their tanks “very inefficiently,”
and that their morale was very
low. They were certainly no
match for the Seventh U.S. In-
fantry when it moved out from
the beachhead near Inchon with
its Pattons.
By September 27 the questions
of actual tactics had given way
to questions of high politics and
strategy. President Truman de-
clared that the decision as to
whether the 38th Parallel would
be crossed would be left to
U.N.0., but there was no doubt
as to what the American stand
would be —even Henry Wallace
has abandoned Moscow and is
attacking it —and little doubt
about the British view even be-
fore Mr. Bevin let it be known
that he was in favor of the move
northwards.
Meanwhile the advance to the
border was left in the hands of
South Korean troops, who were
enjoying a glorious week cul-
minating in the handing-over of
Seoul, their capital, to the South
Korean Government by General
MacArthur at a parade on Sep-
tember 29, and their crossing of
the border —U.N.O. notwith-
standing—at the weekend, three
days after the North Korean
command had decided to aban-
don South Korea.
This action produced the
greatest moments of tension
since the outbreak of hostilities.
Russia and Communist China
had been muttering threaten-
ingly about what would happen
if the 38th Parallel were crossed.
The Fate of U.N.O.
Peking’s threats were con-
veyed, as usual, through Nehru,
who made it clear that he would
not be able to support an ad-
vance into North Korean terri-
tory. His announcement came
the day after his “triumph” in
the Indian Congress in which he
defeated the moderates and
secured acceptance of his plans
for the Indian “welfare State,”
which edge every day a little
nearer to the Marxist concep-
tions of which he used to be an
open and voluble advocate.
He made his acknowledg-
ments to Congress in a speech
in which he pleaded for the ad-
mission of Communist China to
U.N.0., declaring that it was
“fantastic and absurd” that
Chiang Kai-shek’s Government
should be called representative
of China and enjoy the veto. He
said significantly that “the future
of U.N.O. depended on the ad-
mission of Communist China”
—which, pf course, has sup-
ported aggression against U.N.0.,
and is, in fact, master of China
by the same processes by which
North Koreans would have be-
come masters of the whole of
Korea if U.N.O. had not inter-
vened —that is, by blood and
fire, the materials supplied by
Russia as part of the Moscow
campaign for world revolution.
Russian Aid
U.N.O. is about to debate the
fate of North Korea as this is
written. It is carrying on the
discussion with the help of the
real aggressors—Russia and its
satellites —of whose position all
doubts whatever have been re-
moved by the naked threats
which have been issued since
the North Korean armies went
to pieces. The Moscow attitude
was epitomised in its broadcast
describing the landing of the
Americans at Inchon, which,
after it described the going-
ashore of “over 40,000 infantry-
men with artillery and tanks,”
continued:
As is evident, after the reverses
and heavy defeats sustained by the
American military command in Korea
in the struggle against the freedom-
loving Korean people, the Americans
concentrated in the neighborhood of
Inchon almost the whole of the
armed forces of. the United States in
the Far East... .and British troops
as well. Only by operating with such
large forces, 20 times superior in
strength to the forces of the Korean
People’s Army in the area of Inchon,
did the Americans succeed in captur-
ing Inchon the valiant Korean
People’s Army is fighting valiantly for
every inch of its native land.
The official Moscow view is
that while it was a patriotic duty
for the North Koreans to in-
vade South Korea, a cynical
piece of aggression misrepre-
sented to the Russian people in
a series of what can be only
described as deliberate inven-
tions, anything which affects the
integrity of North Korea, which
is for all practical purposes an
unofficial part of the Soviet
Union, is a matter for resist-
ance.
U.N.O. has had before it
during the past fortnight General
MacArthur’s report on Russian
and Communist aid to the
North Koreans. The Security
Council was only able to hear
this read after a two-hour fight
and a vote, the enemy present
in its heart in the person of
Comrade Malik savagely object-
ing.
General MacArthur’s Report
General MacArthur declared
that “considering that the pre-
sent aggression of the North
Korean forces is largely Com-
munist-led, -planned and -in-
spired,” it was “appropriate to
review existing evidence of
material and technical assistance
rendered to North Korea;
specifically evidence of muni-
tions which Soviet Russia has
provided and is now providing
to the North Korean forces, as
well as evidence of the trained
military personnel which the
Chinese Communist forces have
provided.”
He said that immediately
after the surrender of Japan the
Russians began to organise a
North Korean military force
under the disguise of a con-
stabulary—just as has been done
in Eastern Germany.
This force was called the
Korean People’s Army, and was
“from its inception trained,
supervised and logistically sup-
ported by the Soviet Union.”
General MacArthur declared
that the supply of munitions and
armament to North Korea prior
to the withdrawal of the Soviet
forces in 1948 is openly acknow-
ledged by the Soviet Union,
which, however, claims that any
materials and armament of Rus-
sian origin used in the present
war were provided prior to the
Red Army’s withdrawal and
that there has been no re-
supply from Soviet sources since
that time. He wrote:
Despite this Soviet claim, however,
since the outbreak of the war a wide
variety of definitely identified Soviet
equipment captured from the North
Koreans in battle bears the manu-
facturing date of 1949 or 1950.
N. Korean Atrocities
This week and month may
be crucial in the history of the
world. American determination
to press on till Korea is united
under a single Government and
Communist influence driven out
of high places there will cer-
tainly be fortified by what they
found in their march north-
wards over country from which
they retreated in August.
Taejon, for instance, was
found to be something like
Hiroshima after the fall of the
atom-bomb. Its pitiful tene-
ments had been razed to the
ground under a scorched-earth
policy before the Communists
got out of it, and it was dis-
covered that before retreating on
September 27 the enemy had
massacred numbers of American
prisoners-of-war in cold blood,
while in the jail were two
ditches more than 120 feet long
piled high with corpses, each
with its hands tied together—
South Korean police, soldiers,
“capitalists” and small boys.
The mass slaughter of civilians
known to be opposed to Com-
munism by the invaders appar-
ently has run into tens of
thousands.
Call to Surrender
At the weekend General
MacArthur had dropped an air
message on North Korean Army
Command H.Q. calling on them
to lay down their arms wher-
ever they were situated. At the
same time he had authorised
U.N.O. forces to cross the 38th
Parallel in case of military neces-
sity and patrols had pressed into
North Korean territory over the
border for as far as 20 miles
without finding the enemy in
his scorched towns.
The Accounting
It will be the end of U.N.O.
if it does not agree to the com-
plete subjugation of the North
Koreans—who still hold large
numbers of wretched American
p.-0.-w., and are due to account
for their treatment of hundreds
more whom they have murdered
and maltreated, apart from their
account with the South Koreans.
Their aggression, for which
their leaders are punishable
under U.N.O.’s principles of
international law as estab-
lished in World War II and
afterwards, has so far cost more
than 2400 American and British
lives and about 20,000 U.N.O.
casualties all told (outside S.
Koreans), this apart from huge
amounts spent on conducting
the war. The losses and out-
rages wreaked on their fellow-
countrymen with foreign arms
amount to considerably more.
U.N.O. may as well close up
and get out of Asia altogether if
it does not drive its action home
to a logical conclusion, irrespec-
tive of what Russia and Com-
munist China and their mes-
senger, Mr. Nehru (from whom
Mr. Chifley, his great admirer,
seems to derive the whole of
his foreign and military policy
these days), may do.

official Federal Labor on the

measures and the Communist-

grimly amusing if they were not

Labor is a much-divided

first principle as a party is politi-

Those who have violently re-
fused, behind closed doors in

struction of the Communist-
party Dissolution Bill sit silent
in the House while those whom
they oppose speak for them.

debates formed a mass of in-
consistencies. No harried rab-

5 Ugly Facts
&
vm
n
&
s
FAC
1. Aggression In Korea, in Indo-China, in Malaya, is the forerunner
of an aggression which will be on the grand scale unless checked
in advance.
2. The democratic powers, apart from the atomic bomb, are at
present inadequately armed and prepared.
3. A democratic defeat in Europe (including Great Britain) would
gravely imperil Australia at once.
4. With Great Britain and Western Europe in enemy hands, counter-
attack would become enormously difficult, and the resources of
the United States would be strained to the utmost.
5. We cannot re-arm and at the same time have the growth, the
social services, and the working and living conditions we desire
unless we greatly increase our productive effort. Without such an
increase, some or all of these things will suffer, and suffer
grievously.
Painful as it is, this is the truth. You, as an Australian citizen, are entitled to it,
plain and unvarnished. There are things to be done —urgently—to make Australia
strong and secure. We must set ourselves to the task now. This is the only way to
fight a war before it comes. This is a people’s job in which each and every one of
us must share. It is a direct and personal obligation. To avoid it is to become
shamefully near to being a traitor to your country.
ard
for Security
THREE GREAT TASKS WE MUST BEGIN AT HOW EACH ONE OF US CAN HELP
ONCE
First —Build up our armed forces to defend
Australia against aggression.
Second—lncrease essential production—to
equip our forces and to make goods
available for our dangerously high pur-
chasing power and so overcome the
problem of inflation.
Third—Carry on with our projects of
national development—power, migration,
housing—so that the country grows
stronger and greater. And we must do
this without impairing our higher
standard of living and personal security.
1. Every man and every woman who is
physically able must join one or other of
the defence services, either full time or
part time, and prepare to meet an attack
that may come without warning.
1. Every individual must work harder and
produce more—in factories, on farms, in
mines, in business, and essential services.
Only greater production will lower costs
and supply our increasing needs.
3. We must co-operate completely on every
level of every industry, putting our own
interests second to the national welfare.
WHAT WE DO OYER THE NEXT FEW YEARS MAY WELL DETERMINE
THE FATE AND FUTURE OF AUSTRALIA.
Itxnarl fey ihtt Cynuernmeni of fbo'‘ConuaoawooHft of Aust/aiia.
DRI3JI3J9O
his flight with greater agility
than Mr. Chifley.
He, for instance, in speaking
of South Korea, declared that
it was “only fair to say that
while we stand for the principles
of assistance to United Nations
forces, we do not stand for the
sort of Government which was
operating in South Korea before
this trouble began.”
Dr. Evatt and the Chifley
Government’s representatives on
U.N.O. took a great part in
creating the South Korean Gov-
ernment as it was before the
war, in bolstering it up and in
having it recognised as the
official Government not of
South Korea only, but of all
Korea. Australia went out of
its way in the matter td officially
recognise South Korea diplo-
matically as late as August 15
last year. Its delegate sat on
the U.N.O. commission in
Korea, and not one word was
heard from the Chifley Govern-
ment or its Foreign Minister
against the Rhee Government of
Southern Korea on the ground
of its alleged “corruption.”
But now Mr. Chifley suddenly
says that the Rhee Government
which he helped to keep in office
was completely corrupt.
Formosan Problems
Then the question of Formosa
arose in his speech. He said:
There has been a tendency to
talk about defending Formosa,
which, in effect, is supporting the
Chiang Kai-shek regime. That
Administration is also completely
corrupt.
Yet when did the Labor
Government not support the
Chiang Kai-shek regime? It
supported it consistently in and
out of defeat, especially in the
periods when Moscow pretended
to look on it with favor. It was
supporting it when Communism
triumphed in China, and refused
to recognise the Communist
Government as the de facto
Government, either in U.N.O.
or in the outside diplomatic
field. And, anyway, Formosa is
not being considered as Chiang’s
territory but as a vital strategic
base.
Mr. Chifley added that we
“must recognise that if we per-
sist in the policy of entering
fights in the East in every case
where nationalist aspirations arc
strong, and thereby seeming to
stand up for what must be re-
actionary or feudal and now
outmoded types of government,
we will earn the hatred and hos-
tility of Eastern peoples.”
What fights of this nature
have we been engaged in or do
we contemplate being engaged
in? Certainly not in Korea,
which was a case of naked
aggression in which a powerful
nation openly armed a weak one
to attack a Government which
had world recognition. All this
was admitted by Dr. Evatt in
the debate in which Mr- Chifley
spoke.
And certainly not in Malaya,
where the rebels are mainly
foreigners in race if not in
nationality. If the Communists,
who are the only people we are
fighting anywhere, were to win
Malaya would be blacked out
and the great rubber and tin
industries built by British and
Australian enterprise would be
Sovietised, their resources lost
to Russia and its predatory satel-
lites to be used for war against
this and other peaceful nations.
Somersault on U.N.O.
Mr. Chifley’s viewpoint is a
complete negation of his Gov-
ernment’s stand on U.N.O.’s
power of action. Never at any
time while he was in office was
there the slightest dissension by
Labor from the agreed principle
that when U.N.O, should call
for military force to assure the
carrying out of its verdicts and
the suppression of aggression,
the member-countries should
abide by the decisions of the
organisation and provide it with
teeth.
Indeed, at the very first
General Assembly meeting in
January-February, 1946, the
Australian delegate, Mr. Nor-
man Makin, presided over the
Security Council meeting and
laid down the primary principles
of its operation in his presi-
dential address:
In addition to the preliminary
organisation I feel that 1 should
call attention to the need, in
accordance with Article 43 of the
Charter, for the negotiation of
special security agreements, so
that the Security Council may
have as soon as possible the
armed forces, assistance and
facilities necessary to maintain
peace. For the conclusion of
these agreements the advice and
assistance of the Military Staff
Committee will be needed to call
this commtitee into being and to
direct it to the tasks that it is to
perform The maintenance of
peace requires the co-operation of
all members of the United
Nations.
But when the United Nations
begins to put into operation the
policy thus initiated by Australia
Mr. Chifley growls that “the
Labor party does not believe
in sending troops all over the
world to every row that breaks
out.” And he and his party
flatly oppose themselves to the
recruiting campaign which is
intended to secure troops to join
the U.N.O. police force, and to
check the rollijig towards Aus-
tralia of the Communist tide. In
effect, they have set their faces
against any defence at all.
Dr. Evatt’s View
The question of sending
troops abroad for defence pur-
poses of the British Common-
wealth, apart from U.N.0., was
in “Labor’s” mind during the
post-war years. That this might
be done when necessary was part
of “Labor’s” policy. They had
no hesitation in keeping in Japan
our only fightable troops and
our only R.A.A.F. squadron cap-
able of fighting abroad.
“Labor’s” view was stated by
Dr. Evatt in a foreign-affairs
statement to Parliament only last
year:—
The members of the British
Commonwealth of Nations arc
fully grown, and arc ready to
take over in an increasing degree
the responsibilities formerly borne
by the mother country alone. I
have already referred to the
assumption by Australia of certain
British Commonwealth responsi-
bilities in the Pacific. This is only
one example of the trend by
which one or other of the
Dominions will act for the
United Kingdom and other
Dominions in respect of specified
functions or in relation to an
agreed geographical region.
Already in the field of defence
this principle has had several
applications.
But how could this policy be
carried out with all Australian
troops strictly tied to Australian
shores?
To the Last British Conscript
The attitude of the “Labor”
party is that the Australian Gov-
ernment must not have troops
(even volunteers) which it can
send to prevent a landing on,
say, the Tanimbar Islands, 200
miles from the Australian coast,
or in the Solomons to form an
enemy base from which to
invade this country, as the
Japanese might have done.
Should such an operation de-
velop we must send for Ameri-
can or British conscripts to save
us frorc invasion.
If they refuse to come then
invaded we must be. And
“Labor” proposes that until that
actually happens the country
must remain defenceless on land
except for stay - at - home
volunteers —its own expensive
efforts could only rake up
13,000 of them willing to do a
listless and quite useless fort-
night of training every year.
But it is a fixed principle that
Australia’s battles shall be
fought on Australian soil; that
they will not contemplate the
possibility of war without actual
invasion and all the horrors it
brings.
Then Mr. Ward and' his
comrades will fight to the death
to the last capitalist, only sit-
ting down to argue who should
do the job, whether the troops
should have attendance-money
and whether the Waterside
Workers and the Federated Iron-
workers are willing to allow the
Government to fight.
It can be taken for granted
after the servile surrender of
“Labor” to the will of the Com-
munist union-leaders over trade
with Indonesia, the Communist-
party Dissolution Bill and the
currently-debated defence pro-
gramme that unless Messrs.
Healy and McPhillips agree the
only weapons shown if a “Labor”
Government happens to be in
office when an enemy lands will
be white flags and hollow logs.
They are, of course, prepared
to fight in their own way—•
resisting the enemy till the
supply of British, American,
French, Belgian, Italian, Turkish
and Greek conscripts is ex-
hausted.

FAR EAST FEARS.
Europeans no doubt
naturally enough, as they view
things have been decidedly
worried about some points of
American involvement in the
Far East.
Seeing things in those, to
them, rather remote places
somewhat differently from the
way Australians might, they
have been fearful of America
becoming bogged down there,
either with a number of Koreas
or in all-out war with Com-
munist China.
Typically, the “Manchester
Guardian” editorially com-
ments: “It is necessary to be
quite blunt about this. The
Western world is, horrified at the
thought that by the Presidential
declaration about Formosa the
United States may have laid her-
self open to possible war with
Communist China, the very
thing the Russians most want to
provoke.”
As a Continental specimen of
the same feelings, Paris “Le
Monde”: “If the junks of Mao
Tse-tung try tomorrow to con-
quer Formosa they will be met
by the cruisers of MacArthur,
and America will find herself at
war with China: whether she
wills it or not, the East will be-
come the first of her preoccu-
pations and Europe second. On
that day Moscow will have vir-
tually gained the Third World
War; it will be enough for her
to wait until the fruit is ripe.”
In “Le Monde’s” view the
West has reached “the paradoxi-
cal and terribly dangerous situa-
tion that the external policies of
the United States depend not on
her Government but on her ad-
versaries,” a view which “Man-
chester Guardian” declares is
held just as firmly in Britain.
J. Bull in China
Though it would seem that
the U.S. decision to hold For-
mosa for the duration of the
Korean fighting was plain real-
istic strategy, it is this more than
anything which appears to have
given many quarters in Europe
and Britain a bad fright. As
just another British example of
it, London “Observer” wished
to give J. Bull an “alibi” in ad-
vance, declaring that “Recog-
nised or not, this [Communist]
Government is the effective
Government of China, and if
America becomes involved in a
war against it the war will be
between America and China.”
The “Observer” went on to
give this interpretation of British
policy in China:
“China is an old, great and
proud country which will not
easily accept satellite status,
whatever her official ideology.
She has many conflicting in-
terests with Russia, who is try-
ing to detach Manchuria, Mon-
golia and Sinkiang from her.
Taking all this into account, the
wise policy for the West is surely
not to provoke China but to
wait and see and to give her at
least a fair chance to develop an
independent policy.
“This has been the consistent
British aim all along. It is an
integral part of the broader
British policy for Asia: the
policy of encouraging and be-
friending genuine national
movements in Asia and of estab-
lishing the West rather than
Moscow as the disinterested
friend and supporter of the great
Asian revolution of our time.”
Threat to Unity
It would seem that in a good
many British quarters the
former notion of the Chinese
Communists being mere
“agrarian reformers” has given
place to the hopeful idea of them
as probable Titos. Moreover —
as further “Observer” comment
on the same topic suggests —
China and Formosa form an
issue on which there could be a
break in the West (though it
may, perhaps, be thought that
any such break would be at least
as damaging to Britain and
Europe as it would be to
America). The comment runs:
“It is said that we must on no
account allow our policy to be
separated from American policy.
But it is America, not Britain,
who suddenly, without consulta-
tion, reversed previous policy
over Formosa and thereby—
which is more important —
gravely endangered our highest
common interests in Asia.
“As friends and partners of
America in a common cause, it
is our duty to talk frankly to
America at this grave juncture.
We should do all in our power
to induce her to see and redress
a mistake which, if persisted in,
means tragedy for her no less
than for us.”

tive expressions of Continental
and British views ; by way of
contrast, London “Daily Tele-
graph” :
“There continues to be daily
evidence of muddled thinking,
not wholly confined to the
Socialist party, about the Ameri-
can action in Formosa. Both
the facts and the ethics of the
case are perfectly clear. When
Communism let loose the hot
war in Korea it created in the
Western Pacific a new situation
in which strategic factors must
necessarily acquire a decisive
prominence. It needs no prac-
tised military eye to realise from
a glance at the map the stra-
tegic importance of Formosa. It
is a large island bestriding the
sea communications between the
friendly Philippines on the south
and on the north the long chain
of also strategically-important
islands stretching for hundreds
of miles from the southern tip
of Japan. To leave it unpro-
tected would be to expose it to
the virtual certainty of early
occupation by Communism as
represented by the Chinese Gov-
ernment in Peking.”
Another British view of the
Far East in the same more
realistic vein is given by “Time
and Tide,” with a thought for
these parts of the British Com-
monwealth in the Pacific, which,
it must be said, is rare enough
in the general run of British
comment on the Far East these
days:—
“It may be taken for granted
that Mao’s plans for Formosa
have been duly considered in
conjunction with Marshal Stalin.
It is essential that, in the face
of another threat of Communist
aggression. Great Britain and
the United States should act in
unison. Great Britain is jointly
engaged in war with North
Korea with the Americans and
the rest of the United Nations.
Is it conceivable, therefore, that
Great Britain could stand aside
from an American war with
China and Russia, should this
be the outcome of Mao’s pro-
jects on Formosa? The answer
is emphatically no. We are
deeply and fully concerned in
this matter and must make our
position clear. A glance at the
map shows how significant for
the future of south-eastern Asia
and for the future of Australasia
the Communist occupation of
Formosa would be.”
American Viewpoint
The following editorial com-
ment from N. Y. “Herald Tri-
bune” can be taken as expres-
sing responsible U.S. opinion on
the issue, with particular refer-
ence to Britain, and, it might be
said, considerable restraint re-
garding the obviously inviting
side-issue of Britain’s position in
Hong Kong:
“Amid the rolling thunders
from Korea it has been too easy
to forget that Fortnosa is still a
key factor in the complex Far
Eastern equation. But when the
Prime Minister of Great Britain
feels obliged to explain publicly
that British action in Korea ‘is
not concerned with Formosa,’
this question becomes the con-
cern of every thoughtful sup-
porter of the Western alliance.
“The British, hoping to save
Hong Kong, hoping to save their
considerable trade interests in
China and doubtless realising
that one more Communist vote
in the Security Council would
not in practice make much dif-
ference, decided to recognise
Red China. Unfortunately, they
have not thereby removed the
Red threat to Hong Kong or
their trade interests; Red
China has not so far condes-
cended to recognise them, and
they have been left in a very
awkward position in regard to
Formosa. Their recognition of
the Mao Tse-tung regime im-
plied withdrawal of all support
for Chiang’s Nationalists in the
island; and yet Formosa has
assumed a steadily increasing
importance as the only base
from which, after Korea, the
process of Soviet imperial ex-
pansion can be checked.
“In their embarrassment,
British Laborites have been de-
veloping the theory that while
the intervention in Korea is a
necessary answer to aggression
which Britain will fully support.
President Truman’s announced
intention of defending Formosa
against the Chinese Reds was a
reckless invitation to an all-out
war, with China if not with the
Soviet Union, which they wish
to have no part of. One can
only say that it is an unreal
theory. Formosa is no more in-
cendiary a spot than Korea.”
The U.S. paper added that
Korea would probably end any
real menace to Formosa, but if
the United Nations had been
driven from Korea, holding For-
mosa would then have repre-
sented the last possible chance
of retrieving anything from the
wreck, and certainly the last
possible chance of defending
Hong Kong or Britain’s trade
interests in China.
A Revised Policy
As one further, more reassur-
ing, British view, the “Econo-
mist” has commented:
“The [U.S.] Defence Depart-
ment does not want, nor does
General MacArthur, to have
American troops tied down [in
Formosa] or to occupy it.
There has been a revision, rather
than a reversal, of official policy
towards Formosa, because there
has been a revision of the
official estimate of Russian in-
tentions. It can no longer be
assumed that Soviet expansion-
ism will use only the method of
infiltration and will not court
war. Therefore it has become
necessary, in the view of the
Chiefs of Staff (who remember
where the planes which bombed
Manila on December 7, 1941,
came from), to see that Formosa

Meanwhile, the American
Formosa policy remains as
enunciated by the U.S. Assistant
Secretary of State for Far
Eastern Affairs, Dean Rusk:
“We insist upon the cessation of
hostilities between Formosa and
the China mainland, and shall
support the peaceful settlement
of the Formosa problem by In-
ternational action. We welcome
its consideration by the United
Nations. We shall continue our
economic-assistance programme
for Formosa and shall furnish
selected military assistance to
put it in a better position to de-
fend itself if an attempt is made
to dispose of the Formosa prob-
lem by armed attack.”
U.S. Television.
London “Daily Herald”
credits G.B.S. with a typical
Shavianism on television. Asked
for permission to televise his
plays in America, Shaw wrote
back: —
“My works are not available
for television. Television kills a
living work commercially. Mine
are all alive and growing. There
are thousands of first-rate plays
and books commercially dead.
They are your natural prey.”
Nonetheless, there’s not much
doubt about television’s threat
to most prevailing lines of en-
tertainment. In the U.S. (where
the term “video” appears to
have been dropped in favor of
“TV”) it has already made
extraordinary progress. A New
York correspondent of the
“Yorkshire Post” puts it in a
nutshell:
“The American public have
spent more than a thousand mil-
lion dollars on television-sets. In
New York City there are about
1.000. sets, and there are
more than 5,000,000 throughout
the country. Manufacturers
plan to make between 4,500,000
and 5,000,000 sets in 1950.”
Reporting also that there are
now 98 stations in operation
altogether (and temporarily re-
stricted to that by Federal Com-
munications Commission ukase),
the ' correspondent mentions
that present American sets have
a 10, 12h 16 or 19in. screen
and -vary in price with the size
of the screen from about 170
dollars to 500 dollars, with
more expensive sets combining
radios and phonographs with
television available.
As for the fare served up, the
New York man reports: “The
programmes concentrate on
sports, quiz shows and
comedians —both delicious, like
Ed Wynn, a famous music-hall
star, and inane, like Milton
Berle, a former vaudeville per-
former. Both are popular.
There are also many murder
mysteries, deplored by some for
their horror and enjoyed by
others for their thrill. Western
movies exhumed from the tombs
of Hollywood are also shown
frequently, and even the children
are reported to be tired of those.
Then there are the puppets
‘Television,’ wrote a critic in
‘Variety,’ the entertainment-
trades journal, ‘has done more
to popularise puppets than any-
one since Joe Stalin.’ ”
The effect on other entertain-
ment is touched on by another
American correspondent, in
Edinburgh “Scotsman”: “Within
the last three years the number
of cinema seats sold in the
United States on a weekly aver-
age was 70,000,000 against
53.000. today—a drop of
almost one-third.”
The 70,000,000 figure given, it
will be noted, is an average;
and it is a declining average. In
1946, according to “Manchester
Guardian,” 80,000,000 Ameri-
cans a week went to the cinema ;
last year the total was
62.000.
N. Y. “Herald Tribune” states
that actually the proportion of
Americans owning television-
sets “must be terrific.” It, how-
ever, adds that programmes
aren’t improving, and it quotes
Groucho Marx’s wisecrack that
TV stood for “terrible vaude-
ville.”
“That,” it commented a trifle
ambiguously, “is something upon
which Mr. Marx is an ack-
nowledged expert.”
A Jap Monarchy.
A Paris “Le Monde” corres-
pondent, Robert Guillain, look-
ing over the Far East and giving
his impressions in a series of
articles, declares that, for any-
one who knows Japan, “to have
retained the vanquished
sovereign, and not only that but
to have won him over, is one
of General MacArthur’s master-
strokes.”
After that first bold stroke,
however, came irresolution.
Hence, the criticism of British
residents in Tokyo, quoted by
Guillain because they are “good
judges in matters concerning a
sovereign”:
“ ‘To develop a monarchy of
the British type here,’ they said,
‘is one of the things urgently
needed. It is not too late if, as
it seems, the occupation is to be
prolonged. MacArthur has
realised it; but he is not manag-
ing to carry his ideas into
practice. The Americans will
tell you what is wrong, they see
it, they are going to put it right
tomorrow but their anti-
monarchical traditions are too
strong. The Emperor must be
given a practical function,
limited but precise, above politics
but not entirely outside them.’
“ ‘Hardly anything has been
done, except negatively. In
shooting him point-blank with
their cameras, and discovering
that be has warts and limps
slightly, the Japanese have made
yery good imitations of American
journalism. Clearly it is one way
of proving that the Emperor is
just human. But in destroying
the demigod they have not
managed to reconstruct the
sovereign.’ ”
Pakistan Pattern.
The pattern of Statehood
shaping in Pakistan, as given in
the course of a recent detailed
survey by the Karachi corres-
pondent of London “Econo-
mist” :
“Although the present tend-
ency is for Pakistan to align it-
self with the Commonwealth, it
must be remembered that it
stands committed to nothing. It
is for the Constituent Assembly,
which is still only at the early
stages of constitution making, to
decide whether Pakistan re-
mains a Dominion, or a Repub-
lic within the Commonwealth,
or even quits the Common-
wealth altogether. The odds are
that it will follow India’s ex-
ample and become a Republic
within the Commonwealth.
“Pakistan has not, however,
finally found its political niche..
On the other hand, it has deter-
mined its ideological status. It
regards itself as an Islamic de-
mocracy based on ‘lslamic
Social Justice.’ This means a
‘third way,’ lying between capi-
talism and Communism, which
has much in common with
British Socialism and the con-
cept of the Welfare State. Con-
centration of wealth in the hands
of a few individuals is to be
avoided, though private enter-
prise is to have its place. Com-
munism on the Rusian model is
regarded as repugnant to Islam,
but public-utility concerns are
likely to be completely
nationalised within the, next ten
years.”
Dragnet Digest.
Portent in Japan. —Noted by the
Tokyo correspondent of London
“Economist”: “Mr. Yoshida [the Jap
Prime Minister] was privately aston-
ished at the lack of any adverse
world reaction —even in Australia
to General MacArthur’s sudden
order to him to enlist a reserve
police-force of 75,000 men, which,
bland denials notwithstanding, may
be the nucleus of the new Japanese
standing army.”
* * * ♦
A Way They Have in Korea. —A
“Manchester Guardian” special cor-
respondent reporting from Korea
touches on the subject of an overcoat
which had been stolen from the
American Vice-Consul, and which the
authorities were anxious to restore to
its owner: “A few days after the
loss had been reported the Chief of
Police personally called on the Vice-
Consul to assure him that ‘all is well,
as I am currently torturing two sus-
pects.’ These were his very words.”
* * * *
The Schuman Clinch. —Why the
French accept the Schuman plan,
explained by a London “Nineteenth
Century” writer: “The French, espe-
cially the bulk of the people, still
distrust the Germans, but events, both
extra-European and Continental, are
bringing more and more Frenchmen
to realise that, firstly, there may be
worse perils than Teuton militarism,
and, secondly, there is much to be
said for a clinch when the alternative
is a knock-out.”
* * * *
In Round Figures. —Given in a
recent Truman speech; The expanded
U.S. programme for preserving the
peace of the world will require from
about $25,000 million to $30,000
million annually by next June, and
probably much more than that in
the following years. “America’s pro-
ductive ability,” said Truman, “is the
greatest in the history of the world,
and it can be expanded a great deal
more to meet the conditions with
which we are faced. With our
economy now producing at an annual
rate approaching $275,000 million, the
goal I set last year of a $300,000
million economy by 1954 will un-
doubtedly be surpassed. With this
kind of dynamic growth we can arm
ourselves and help arm the free
world.”
* * * *
American “War Aims” —Hailing a
Truman speech as completing coun-
tering the maligning of American
policy abroad, the “Hindustan
Times” (Delhi) sums it up: “Here-
after there cannot be doubts and
suspicions as to what America stands
for in the present conflict. America
stands for Korean unity, localisation
of the Korean conflict, the future of
Formosa being decided by interna-
tional action, freedom of Far Eastern
Nations, and last, but not least, she
does not believe in preventive war.”
♦ • ♦ •
India’s Treaty with Nepal. —A
probable direct effect of the Chinese
Communist threat to Tibet, as com-
mented on by a “Yorkshire Post
special correspondent: “India’s treaty
with Nepal was an indication of
increasing awareness. Though it was,
in fact, merely a replacement, with
modifications, of the old treaty
between Britain and Nepal, it was
significant as a disclaimer of any
Indian desire to include Nepal in the
Indian Union. Before August indig-
nant reports about maltreatment of
Congress workers in Nepal erupted at
intervals in the Indian Press. The
treaty shows that the Congress Gov-
ernment has no wish to antagonise
the useful military power of Nepal
by any attempt on her sovereignty.”
* ♦ * *
Tory "Hypocrisy.” —Sir Duff Cooper,
in a London “Daily Mail” article on
the Schuman Plan, asserts that, while
the British Labor-party manifesto
rejecting the Schuman scheme pro-
vided the Opposition with a big stick
wherewith to beat the Government,
“in their secret hearts they believe,
whatever some of their leaders may
say, that the Government have been
perfectly right. Their friends in the
British steel industry tell them so,
and those who have friends in the
French steel industry have found that
they are of the same opinion.”
♦ * * ♦
Dutch New Guinea. —A reader at
this end of things must be struck by
the astonishing (not to say alarming)
very general eagerness of the British
Press to give Asia away, from Korea
and Formosa right down and round
(maybe skipping Hong Kong, though
even that’s doubtful). Here’s the
“Manchester Guardian” on Spender:
“He says that in the Australian
Government’s judgment there is no
foundation whatever for the claim
that Dutch New Guinea belongs to
Indonesia ‘geographically.’ It is, he
said, ‘part of New Guinea, not of
Indonesia.’ It is very much to be
hoped that Indonesia and the Nether-
lands will settle the matter between
themselves, as was provided for in
the Hague agreement.” And let Aus-
tralia take the result and like it!
♦ ♦ ♦ ♦
New U.S. Weapons. —An extensive
review of U.S. defence by a London
“Times” special correspondent men-
tions, regarding tanks, that what is
believed to be the best light tank in
the world is “on order” there. The
prototype of a new medium tank
exists. Only in heavy tanks has
advance not proceeded beyond the
stage of design. For anti-aircraft
defence, where the jet plane has made
the last war’s ground-defence weapons
inellcctive against medium-altitude
aircraft, a new 75mm. “Sky-Sweeper”
gun and a new fire-control system
have been developed. The 75mm.
“Sky-Sweeper” gun has an integrated
fire-control system and “is capable
of tracking and attacking aircraft at
supersonic speeds by day and by
night.”
♦ * * ♦
Rearmament Cost. Pointing out
that the production of armaments,
though it may in certain countries
provide much-needed employment, is
in the strictly economic sense a waste
of resources still needed for recovery
from the effects of the last war, tte
Edinburgh “Scotsman” comments:
“The O.E.E.C. report on the financial
situation in Western Europe gives
warning of the danger of not making
readjustments in economic policy as
a whole to meet the new burden.
What this probably means is that to
minimise the long-term effects of
armaments, something like the
economic, and particularly the finan-
cial, controls which were employed
during the war will have to be
reimposed. The enormous task of
putting Western Europe in a military
condition to oppose a Russian inva-
sion will to a considerable degree
entail most of the economic effects,
except that of actual physical destruc-
tion, of war.”

Copyright of Hymns. London
“Times” having reported the Bishop
of Sheffield’s view that anyone who
writes a hymn or composes a hymn
tune should feel bound to offer it
freely to the service of the universal
Church; that copyright in this is “not
merely a confounded nuisance, but
a sin,” a reader dipped his pen in a
little acid and wrote to the editor:
“Does the Bishop mean that poets,
composers, artists of all kinds —
notoriously the worst-rewarded sec-
tion of the community—should offer
their labors freely to the Church?
Artists alone? The Bishop’s own
service to the universal Church is
not only salaried but carries a pen-
sion.”

“Yes, that’s right,” replied
Molly.
“Well, why isn’t it being

demanded the Fuhrer. “If the

washing blown overboard.”
“That probably means there
were two stanchions bent, then,”
said Joe. “It’s a pity they
hadn’t sunk the four battleships
—it would have meant that the
margin of the strength of the
heavies of the West would have
been reduced to thirty-two to
our one and a half. Have any
further reports come in about
the performance of our Josef
Stalin monster fireproof, im-
penetrable tanks?”
“Yes, Fuhrer, excellent,” ex-
claimed Molly. “They do full
honor to your revered name.
The German prisoner-tech-
nicians we drafted to Korea re-
port that the new American
bazooka-shells cannot go right
through our tanks, as they have
wildly claimed. All they can
do is go through one side only,
and then explode inside the
tank. Also, in encounters with
flamo-throwing American Pat-
tons, after our wreck could be
approached, it was found that
the rivets had been almost un-
affected by the fire, and one of
the tractor-treads had scarcely
been scorched. It is most grati-
fying. I can well imagine the
Americans’ chagrin at this failure
of their vaunted fire-power.”
“What have you done about
that self-propelled gun of ours
that the Americans captured and
sent as an exhibit to Lake Suc-
cess?”
“That was a bit hard,” con-
fessed Molly, “but our Ambas-
sador got to work on our fifth-
column there. When Austin
displayed it to the delegates
Malik was there to point to the
markings on it. Made in the
great Stalinovitch works at
Nijni-Novgorod in 1910 —our
fifth - columnist had neatly
altered the five to a one.”
“But there were no self-pro-
pelled guns in nineteen-ten,” ex-
claimed the Red Fuhrer testily.
Molly smiled with Oriental
cunning. “True, comrade,” he
said triumphantly. “But there
was no Stalinovitch works,
either. That will trick the dull
Americans! ”
Joe unleashed the half-scowl
that did him for a genial smile
at the prospect of democratic
warmongering discomfiture.
Then, to Molotov’s expressed
surmise that the North Koreans
would soon be rapidly “folding-
up,” and his cynical question
whether the little Father of all
the Russians intended to let
them stew in their own juice,
the Red Fuhrer simply asked in
reply: “What do you think?”
“Well, in the cause of that
peace which alone of the Great
Powers the U.S.S.R. so ardently
espouses in the face of a Wes-
tern world mad for war,” put
in Molly in his best grand
manner, “and which will shortly
be given expression in Sheffield
with the kind permission of the
finest bunch of Socialist mugs
in captivity, I suggest that the
time is now ripe to denounce,
as an earnest of our genuine de-
sire for peace, the bloody-
minded North Korean leaders
who aggressively started the war,
and, seeing that with childlike
faith they’ll rush across our
border shortly for protection,
we can hand them over as war-
criminals for international trial.
Then we can get our propoganda
machine going full-blast to
build you up as the new prince
of peace.”
Joe looked at his deputy with
as near to admiration as any
cutthroat dictator dares.
“Molly,” he said handsomely,
“sometimes I think you almost
have a fraction of my collecti-
vised brains!”

SPORTING NOTIONS
YOUR SHOUT!
AND IT'S
RED MILL RUM.
The pefversity of human nature is
in no way better illustrated than by
the regular phenomenon of thousands
of folk, who visit the races at the
most once or twice a year, choosing
for their rare visits meetings at which
personal comfort is reduced to nil
and the odds against picking winners
reach their zenith. At the same time
it was surprising that there were not
far more than 66,000 at Randwick on
Saturday for the opening of the
AJ.C. spring meeting; the weather
was good and there were no sporting
counter-attractions. Still, an attend-
ance of 66,000 is more than ample
to expose Randwick’s shortcomings,
one of the principal of which stems
from inadequate tote facilities. Far
too few in number, and poorly laid
out, the tote stations produce a vast
interlocking web of queues which
completely strangle free circulation of
the crowd.
With 18 acceptors, one of the big-
gest fields on record lined up for the
£lO,OOO Derby. Playboy won from a
field of 20 last year, but previously
the record had been 17 runners, first
sighted in Trivalve’s year (1927) and
again encountered when Valiant
Crown won in 1947. The Victorian
filly, and only filly in the field, True
Course held her favoritism, and
started at threes, but she was destined
to provide yet another demonstration
that the Derby, with its high weight
scale, is a most difficult race for a
filly to win.
As had happened at his only
previous Sydney start, when he
performed so well at Rosehill, un-
familiarity with the mobile starting-
barrier cost the Victorian colt Alister
a lot of ground at the start. True
Course, too, had soon drifted well
back in the field as Auld Acquaint-
ance, winning the scramble for posi-
tion, led them out of the straight at
a merry clip. From the half-mile
mark Alister commenced to improve
bis position, and True Course, stick-
ing to the rails, also moved up
rapidly. Auld Acquaintance held a
narrow lead as they turned for home,
buf Rumyle quickly collared him,
and, getting well to the front, for a
moment looked the winner. However,
Alister continued his run in fine style,
headed Rumyle at the distance, and
ran on to win convincingly by two
lengths. True Course finished on
gamely, but failed by a half-length
to beat Rumyle for second money.
The result of the Derby was a
splendid advertisement for the com-
paratively young imported stallion
Whirlaway, who stands at A. W.
Thompson and Co.’s Widden Stud,
Kerrabee, N.S.W. Both Alister and
Rumyle are by Whirlaway. Alister
is out of New Flower, a three-quarter
sister to that good, but fearfully
unlucky, stayer Silver Standard, who
had the frustrating record of running
second in a Melbourne Cup, a Caul-
field Cup and two Metropolitans. The
dam of Rumyle is Magi, a Brueghel
mare and a good performer.
Whirlaway himself did not have a
particularly brilliant racing career, and
the poor English prizemoney of the
period makes his record look, on
paper, more mediocre than it was.
Racing as a two-, three- , and fou.r-
year-old Whirlaway had, m all, 17
starts for one win (a Maiden Plate),
four seconds and two thirds, rep-
resenting a total stake-earnings
£167 Alister’s cut from the
Derby prize was just on £BOOO more
than his sire amassed m his entire
career, and Rumyle collected £2OOO
for second place., Nevertheless Whirl-
away is a fine individual, and rep
resents some choice blood.. f
by the unbeaten Bahrain, winner o
the Two Thousand Guineas, Derby
and St Leger, out of Jury, a halt-
sister to another St. Leger winner m
Scottish Union.
Alister, a big bright chestnut colt,
was ridden by R, Heather, who, by
coincidence, won a previous AJL.
Derby on another chestnut sired at
Widden Stud— Magnificent m 1945.
Alister is trained by H. Wolters for
W. Balloch, a stipe steward of the
Melbourne Trotting Control Board.
As this page had unswervingly pro-
pounded True Course for the Derby
ever since seeing her win the autumn
two-year-old classics, some comment
on her “failure” seems called for,
without, however, attempting to de-
tract from Alister’s fine win Cer-
tainly she was not disgraced; hers
was a game run, and its quality was
emphasised by the contrast in appear-
ance between her small light frame
and some of the fine, big, strapping
colts in the Derby field; Auld
Acquaintance, for instance, is some-
thing up in the 17-hands class. One
took it for granted at the time that
connections knew what they were
doing (and probably they did), but,
looking at matters in retrospect, one
wonders now if two quick runs a
month before the Derby really con-
stituted an adequate preparation for
such a tough race. As to the actual
running of the race, present writer
had a faint suspicion that True
Course’s rider, the usually mgh-
infallible Williamson, had for once
misjudged the early pace, which was
fairly hot; the winner’s time was
2.321 —fastest since Main Topic
clocked 2.3 li in 1942. This may have
prevented her from being closer to
Alister at the finish, but it is doubtful
whether she could have beaten him on
the day.
The Epsom was, as usual, a race
of excitement and of fast and furious
action. But it went within an ace of
joining Grace Darling’s Caulfield Cup
in the record books as a race of grim
tragedy. As the field of 26 (biggest
in as many years) bunched up in the
exciting scramble round the home
turn, there was a sudden ripple of
disturbance in mid-field, and, the next
instant, a split-second impression of
horses catherine-wheeling, hooves
spinning high over the field, and
jockeys flying through the air and
being kicked and bundled along the
ground. Then, as the survivors swept
on their way, it was seen that,
miraculously, only four had come
down —among them, sad to relate,
this page’s selection, Persist. None
of the boys was seriously hurt; of
the horses, the fairish performer
Dickens had to be destroyed.
To win a handicap such as the
Epsom a topweight, unless he be a
Bernborough, has to have all the luck
of the running. Such was the case
with Achilles, who carted 9.2 on
Saturday. All the way he encoun-
tered an absolutely charmed passage
along the rails, and had to pass out-
side barely a single horse. Further-
more, he missed all the trouble in the
fall at the turn. With everything thus
in his favor Achilles was able to
finish brilliantly in the straight to
score by a half-head from Oversight
in a photo-finish. The hot favorite
Humming Top ran quite a fair race
to finish third, three lengths behind
Oversight. Achilles conceded both
minor placegetters 301 b., and cut out
the mile in 1.36 i, which is average
good time for an Epsom, though two
seconds outside Shannon’s course
record.
Jockey W. Williamson was seen at
his best on Achilles, and the win
compensated for his missing out on
True Course. Stablemate of True
Course, Achilles is trained in Mel-
bourne by F. W. Hoysted for A.J.C.
committeeman T. L. Baillieu. Achilles
is a chestnut colt by Ajax from the
Brueghel mare Minnamurra. With all
due respect to Magnificent’s fine
record of winning the Breeders’ Plate,
HobartvUle, Sires’ Produce and
Champagne Stakes and the two
Derbies, Achilles, a four : year-old
with much of his best racing days
ahead of him, may prove, if he has
not done so already, to be the best
of Ajax’s get.
When the yearling sales are in the
offing it is customary for turf scribes
to offer a spot of gratuitous warning
to those who indulge in perhaps the
riskiest of gambles—paying big prices
for the unknown quantity of a year-
ling. Reference is made to the top-
priced lots who have turned out
duds, and, of course, to all the cham-
pions who have been bought for a
song.
• • • • •
To look upon the other side of the
picture, results of the principal
events on Derby Day provided a
pretty fair demonstration that the
more costly youngsters aren’t always
duds. In the Derby itself, the first
four past the post had all fetched
four-figure sums as yearlings—Alister,
1500 guineas; Rumyle, 2100 guineas;
True Course, 1150 guineas; and Auld
Acquaintance, 1100 guineas. Achilles,
whose Epsom win added £4235 to
his already-fair stake earnings, was
a 2300-guineas yearling. The other
major events on the card, the
Breeders’ Plate and the w.-f.-a. Colin
Stephen Stakes, were won respectively
by Lloric and Delta, both of whom
cost 2600 guineas as yearlings.
In taking the Breeders’ Plate,
Lloric (T. Mullane) led most of
the way to win handily from fast-
finishing Fengari and Memory Inn.
Channel Swell was' the sire best rep-
resented in the Plate field, with four
runners, and he supplied the winner.
Lloric is out of Rapture, a daughter
of Constant Son and the Magpie
mare Parfait Amour. Fengari is a
likely-looking Felcrag colt, and
Memory Inn is a son of Roadhouse.
The small but classy field contesting
the weight-for-age race consisted of
Delta, Thracian Lad, Benvolo, Fox-
zami, Dark Marne and Sir Falcon.
With first-class riders on each of
these good gallopers, tactics were the
order of proceedings, and, though the
pace was slowish, it was the best
race of the day to watch. They
finished in the order mentioned, with
about four lengths covering the
bunch.
♦ ♦ • •
A heavy track, poorish fields, un-
pleasant weather and a monotonous
succession of unsuccessful favorites
were the lot of racegoers at Moonee
Valley on Saturday. Principal events
were the £2OOO Moonee Valley Stakes
and the £lOOO Quality Handicap, and
Iron Duke, taking the Quality, was
the most noteworthy winner of the
afternoon.
There were several Caulfield Cup
candidates in the Quality field,
including King Comedy, Comedy
Prince, Regular Port and last year’s
Cup winner, Lincoln. In beating this
bunch very easily, as he did, the Le
Grand Due four-year-old Iron Duke
showed that he is right back to the
excellent form he displayed last sea-
son in winning the Caulfield Guineas
and other good races. Distance was
10 furlongs; carrying his
Cup weight of 8.11, Iron Duke took
charge half a mile from home, and
ran on strongly to beat Lincoln and
Regular Port by a length and a half.
South Australian colts are making
rather a habit of bagging the well-
endowed Moonee Valley Stakes. Last
year it went to St. Comedy and the
year before to Phoibos. This time
the successful visitor was the Beau
Cbeval colt Beau Avion, who, in a
rattling close finish, defeated Lon-
donderry and odds-on favorite Flying
Halo by margins of a half-neck and
a head; Londonderry finished much
the best of tfie three. Time of 1.42£
was the slowest recorded since the
distance was altered to a mile in
1937.
Other results were not of great
account. Adela was the only suc-
cessful favorite; she beat Happy
Medium by lengths in the mile Merri
Handicap. Old Bay David, who is
more than half way to voting age,
won the Mt. Cotterell Steeple;
Queensland sprinter Commentator
beat favorite Gay Archer in the Nulla
Nulla Highweight; 80-to-l chance
King Carnival pipped even-money
favorite Lucky Mascot in the 10-
furlongs Pascoe Handicap; and
Erriton won the Corroboree Handi-
cap.

When last sighted in these parts,
only as far back as 1938, “Bobby
Locke was a slim, sharp-featured
youngster who played pretty fair golf
for the little-more-than-schoolboy he
appeared to be, but was not quite
a match for some of our topnotchers.
About the only thing unchanged in
the transition from that Locke to
the Locke here accurately depicted
by Wells is the plus-fours. He wore
them then and still does, what time
most leading golfers have taken to
“BOBBY” LOCKE.
sporting anything that takes then eye.
And what takes some of the said
eyes would blind most mortal optics.
While the’ strain of constant high-
pressure pro. golf, interspersed by a
spell of war-time flying, has wreaked
a change in the general Locke appear-
ance, it has also had a strong effect
on the Locke golf. Today Locke
is more than a match for our top
pros., and, for that matter, those of
other countries. Locke has seen no
reason to subject himself to the year-
round grind of American pro. golf;
he simply pops over from time to
time and picks up a few of the
choicer prizes. In the meantime he
nabs what is to be nabbed in his
own and other countries, and occa-
sionally bags an odd British Open or
two. Currently Locke is doing a tour
of exhibition matches in these parts,
and instilling either eternal inspira-
tion or utter frustration in local week-
end golfers more concerned with
breaking 100 than bruising the course
record.

“Pass-it”: Taking a glance back
over the Rugby Union season just
concluded, the most disturbing feature,
with an eye to the future of the game
here, is the change in our style of play.
The game as once played involved two
sets of forwards battling it out for
possession, after which the half
cleared the play from the opposing
forwards and set lus backs off at their
top with a quick pass straight from
the ground. The backline in posses-
sion, confronted man-for-man by the
opposing line, then had to turn on
every trick and manoeuvre of the
game to outwit the defence. The net
result —fast, exciting football.
Except for the refreshing exhibitions
given by the British Isles tourists,
there has been none of this in our
football this season. Some are hasty
to attribute this to a temporary loss
in the art of backline attack; actually
it goes much deeper. The root of the
trouble traces back some few years to
the introduction of a local dispensa-
tion of the rules to prevent the break-
aways moving past an imaginary line
through the centre of the scrum. The
full effects of this are now emerging.
Designed to give the slow half-backs
more time to get the ball away, the
local rule has gone much further and
produced a situation where the for-
wards, no longer able to harass the
opposing half, move straight across
the field towards the inside
centre, who now has to beat
not only his own man but
also two of the opposing
forwards. The difficulties of
doing this are now becoming
evident,, and players are
resorting to kicking tactics to
avoid being caught with
the ball. Some teams, at
times, go to the length of
deliberately presenting the
ball to the opposition with a
view to worrying them into
errors from which chances to score
may be pilfered.
The only solution to the situation
is for the half-back to run from the
scrum base before passing the ball on.
This would hold the forwards in,
though it means the end of wing-
threequarter play. But unfortunately,
and aggravating the whole situation,
most coaches, steeped in the good old
style of play, do not grasp the impli-
cations of the new set-up and, while
the forwards are playing to suit the
new order, the coaches continue to in-
struct the backs to follow the old
procedure; the two simply don’t mix.
♦ * * ♦
Although it had seemed that he was
to be a rare exception, Joe Louis, like
so many before him, was unable to
resist the temptation of trying a
“comeback.” That one-fight-too-many
seems to have an irresistible attrac-
tion, and the outcome is almost
inevitable. At Yankee Stadium, New
York, last week a slow and flabby
Louis climbed into the ring to meet
seven-years-younger and several-stone-
lighter Ezzard Charles. Fifteen
rounds later the Louis who had
retired undefeated world champion
left the ring a battered and sorrow-
fully-beaten former champion. At
any rate the bout should help to
clear up the world heavyweight
championship position, which had
been wrangled into,,an unearthly mess
since Louis first “retired.”

For his match with Ray Coleman
(9.1) at Leichhardt last week Mel-
bourne featherweight “Bluey” Wil-
kins (8.13) had his manager-trainer
Ambrose Palmer in his corner. If
their positions had been reversed the
outcome might have been also. As
it was, Wilkins could not match
Coleman, who was boxing like a
champion. A very fast little fighter,
Wilkins won the first two rounds.
Then Coleman began shooting rips
downstairs, and his perfect punching
from then on saw him a clear winner
on points.

THE MAN ON
THE LAND
"DON'T WORRY. I'M SENDING IT TO
GRAZCOS."
Future for Fat Lambs.
“C.S.”: Amidst all the excite-
ment about wool prices arises
the sober and experienced voice
of J. F. Guthrie, C.8.E., whose
fame as a sheep and wool expert
scarcely needs emphasising.
Guthrie urges fat-lamb raisers
not to be stampeded out of meat
production by current wool
prices and is firmly convinced
that the future for meat is more
assured than for wool.
There is no danger of synthetic
substitutes for meat, he points
out, as there is for wool if wool
prices get beyond the reach of
ordinary people. The world is
hungry for meat, and the present
Australian export output of
4,000,000 fat lambs a year could
be multiplied 10 times and still
the demand —and the price—
would be strong.
There is a tremendous future
for the extension of the fat-lamb
industry, not in the outback
where the Merino reigns, but
along the coastal littoral. Is
there any income-earner that
can surpass a good lamb mother
producing £4 of wool herself and
a lamb worth £4 to £5? “On
ewe-to-the-acre country, of
which there is a large area in
the eastern States, a very big
future awaits the fat-lamb pro-
ducer.”
New Era for Vets.
“Bungaree”; The schemes
originated by N.Z. co-operative
dairy centres and factories have
been adopted in our coastal areas
with outstanding success. The
usual arrangement is that the
dairy company is responsible for
salaries, which are paid out of
a fund built up by a small levy
on dairy products. As mileages
—the bugbear of country prac-
tice —are small, the scheme
works well. The standard of
| animal health and production
has gone up and the cost to the
individual has been insignificant.
With the exception of light-
carrying, far-out areas, there are
prospects that within a year or
two every town will have a resi-
dent vet. Establishment of
western veterinary services pre-
sents more difficulties, as a vet.
may spend more time travelling
to and from cases than in actual
practice ; consequently the pros-
pect of heavy mileage charges is
a deterrent. The vet. in a new
district must also face the possi-
bility of working at a loss for
a year or two until he can break
down the apathy and general dis-
inclination to consult him. The
formation of veterinary clubs by
proprietary firms has overcome
initial difficulties in some parts.
If stockowners realised how
an experienced vet. could help
them the only limiting factor to
complete veterinary coverage of
Australia would be the shortage
of vets. The sheep-breeder in
particular could improve man-
agement, reduce stock losses and
cut down expenditure on
drenches, flydressings, etc., by
having expert advice on mules-
ing, internal and external para-
site control and the correct use
of modern insecticides to cope
with the blowfly, and how to get
best results from vaccines. If
the drenching of sheep were
approached with a knowledge of
the parasites involved, the
strategic time to hit them, the
effects of various drenches on
different parasites and their
possibilities and limitations, our
sheep would be healthier and the
bill for drenches, etc., smaller.
We need a new conception of
veterinary services. Instead of
calling in the vet. in a last-
minute rush to save some sick
animal from death, use his ex-
perience and knowledge to advise
you how to prevent disease.
Treatment of disease is usually
costly and throws an extra
burden on a short-staffed pro-
perty. Prevention is the best
possible form of insurance, and
it pays dividends out of all pro-
portion to the premium.
Queensland Wheat.
“Agric”; Queensland growers
want a wheat-experiment farm
for breeding and developing
high-quality milling and rust-
resistant wheats in the main
grain-growing areas of the
Downs, also for testing under
local conditions wheat bred in
other parts of the Common-
wealth.
A Jimbour wheatgrower (C.
R. Perrin) said it took at least
seven years to evolve a new
variety of wheat, and only one
new variety had been bred in
Queensland during the past 10
years—Florence x College, bred
at Gatton College.
Practically all their own
varieties had gone to the wall
and he didn’t know where they
could turn next, hence for a long
time he had been advocating
the establishment of a wheat-
research farm in Queensland
Manager of the State Wheat
Board (C. C. McKeon) said that
discussions regarding the estab-
lishment of some sort of wheat-
research station had been pro-
ceeding between the board, the
Agriculture Department, millers
and bakers, and he wanted sug-
gestions on the means of raising
the necessary funds. H. T.
Merson (Cecil Plains) suggested
that the £300,000 held by the
Australian Wheat Board from
pools which had been wound up
and from other sources might
be handed to the C.5.1.R.0. for
wheat research.
F. J. Armstrong, of the Aus-
tralian and State Wheat Boards,
thought it would be better if
the State’s share of the £300,000
were transferred to the State
Board for spending in Queens-
land. E. A. Thomas (Wallum-
billa) said that the Co-operative
Milling Association was prepared
to contribute £3OO per annum
for three years to assist the pro-
ject. He thought this was a
unique opportunity for grain-
growers to contribute to raise
sufficient money for a research
officer to be appointed immedi-
ately.
Fruit in Hong Kong.
“He-Ne”: According to H.
Broadfoot, of N.S.W. Depart-
ment of Agriculture, who has
just returned from there, the
market for fruit and vegetables
in Hong Kong is highly com-
petitive. Hong Kong is a free
port, and large and regular sup-
plies of fruit, particularly
oranges, come from the United
States. These are subsidised to
the extent of 160 cents per case.
Shipping arrangements from the
U.S. are excellent, and Australia
will be hard put to it to compete.
Broadfoot considers Australia
would have the best chance in
Singapore, but should move
quickly to develop this market
before Singapore gets a free
flow of dollars. He thinks W.A.
is in the best geographical posi-
tion to exploit the Singapore
“ Cripes, I didn't think you'd remember my birthday, Joe."
market, as there is a regular 10
days’ shipping service from
there.
Mintweed.
“Dick Turpin”: Landowners
in nor’-west N.S.W. are fright-
ened of the progress it will
make during the next drought.
Already 4,000,000 acres in the
Warialda and Inverell districts
are infested since the weed began
to move south from Queensland
some years ago ; it is common
as far south as Coolah and Tam-
worth, and isolated patches have
appeared at Berrigan, in the
Riverina, and on the You Yang
ranges in Victoria.
Poisonous to hungry or travel-
ling stock, the plant is a prolific
grower under the worst of con-
ditions, and spells ruin to native
and sown grasses wherever it
takes charge. K. R. Green, of
N.S.W. Department of Agri-
culture, describes it as the worst
weed in the State, and warns that
it may spread further south and
infest a far larger area.
It mainly attacks overstocked,
overfarmed or rabbit-infested
country, and its seed will germi-
nate after a fall of only 10 points
of summer rain, which explains
its danger during droughts. The
plant grows to a maximum
height of about 30 inches, or it
may never grow beyond a few
inches. It is most adaptable, and
its seed can be carried by almost
any method.
No effective counter to mint-
weed has yet been found. The
new hormone weedicides will
certainly kill it, but their cost
is far too great for use on large
areas. On the Darling Downs
the sowing of liverseed grass as
a counter has been effective, but
further south it has been of little
use.
Algaroba Libelled.
“Weedexp”: In B. 6/9/’5O
the tree at Winton (n.-w. Q.)
that has assumed serious pest
proportions is called an alga-
roba. This is not correct; the
offender is Acacia arabica.
Algaroba is the mesquite of
Mexico, which has been widely
grown in Queensland, including
Winton, against the repeated ad-
vice of the Government botanist
that it could become a serious
pest. It has not yet increased
very much. It provides good
shade, grows quickly and has
considerable fodder value.
Acacia arabica, on the other
hand, is of little food value, but
has increased alarmingly to the
proportions that contributors
allege concerning algaroba.
The two are easily dis-
tinguished, for the Acacia has
long thorns and a round typical
wattle-flower, while the algaroba
has shorter stout thorns and
flowers on a long hanging spike.
New Land Paper.
“C.S.”: Another magazine
has joined the parade of agricul-
tural journals catering for land
men. Titled “The Country Hour
Journal,” it is a monthly com-
pendium of the broadcasts from
the Country Hour sessions on
A.B.C. In addition to the rural
programmes for each month, it
gives the country man a survey
of agricultural progress at home
and abroad, and a selection of
those broadcasts about which
he may refresh his memory.
All varieties of land life are
fairly well covered and all
branches of land production. In
the September issue there was a
very good article on fat-lamb
raising by Jack Coleman, and
C. Semmler made a plea for
wheat-grading, one of the extra-
ordinary lacks in Australian
wheat-production. One of the
magazine’s chief attractions is
the high quality of the printing.
Manuring for Maize.
“Hortus”: It is almost im-
possible to make the soil too
rich for maize. A 50-bushel
crop removes from the soil
during growth approximately
751 b. of nitrogen, 301 b. of phos-
phoric acid and 501 b. of potash.
There’s no doubt that old farm-
yard manure that has been lying
in heaps for some time is ideal ;
however, it is not always avail-
able, and, what’s more, is be-
coming more expensive.
Cheapest means of supplying
nitrogen to maize soils is to put
in some leguminous crop, such
as peas, beans, vetches, clovers
or lupins. Velvet-beans and
cowpeas have proved most satis-
factory.
Besides supplying rich humus
from the green-manuring, these
crops gather nitrogen from a
cheap source —the air—and fix
it in the soil. You can always
tell whether the leguminous
crop is functioning in this way
or not. Pull up a bean- or a
pea-root and see if there are any
little growths or nodules on the
roots. If there are, then you
may be certain that the nitrogen-
fixing bacteria are at work
changing the nitrites into sol-
uble nitrates.
If unable to plant these crops
let the weed-growth accumulate
and then turn it under for
humus. It is inadvisable to
apply readily-soluble nitrogen
fertilisers to maize at time of
sowing. These are apt to pro-
mote a soft and sappy growth,
which causes trouble if a dry
spell comes.
The amount of super, per acre
differs with the geographical
position. The northern inland
areas have not been cultivated
with maize as much as the
southern. So less super, (say
|cwt.) is needed in the north.
The general soil of Australia
contains a fair amount of phos-
phoric acid, and that is why land
that has not been worked to any
great extent requires less super,
with the sowing of the seed. In
the southern areas 2cwt. of
super, is advised. On the coast,
both north and south, where
maize has been a major crop,
2cwt. of super, is advocated.
Collect rubbish and put it on
the ground to be sown with
maize. Prunings of bushes,
shrubs, grapes and fruit-trees,
when heaped-up and burnt, pro-
vide a very fair percentage of
potash. Even the scorned
bracken-fern supplies the second-
largest percentage of potash
(from 16 p.c. to 20 p.c.), with
Finns insignis in the first place.
Virgin soil, on which the rough
scrub has been burnt, produces
a first-class maize return.
Tomato Pests.
“Rooster”: Both under glass
and in the open they get out of
hand unless checked. Most
damage is done in the open,
however, and such crops should
be examined at least once a
week.
Cutworms in Victoria are par-
ticularly damaging during sum-
mer. Young plants are voraci-
ously attacked soon after plant-
ing out, the stems being cut at
ground-level. Cutworms are
nocturnal in habits; hard to
find in daylight. Control is best
done by killing all weeds in or
around the crop, thus making it
difficult for spring eggs to hatch.
Poison-bait scattered over the
ground will safeguard the actual
plants. The standard prepara-
tion is as follows: Bran 241 b.,
Paris-green 11b., water 3gal.,
salt Boz. Addition of half a
dozen crushed lemons increases
the potency. Mix bran and
Paris-green dry, dissolve salt
and lemons in the water and
make a semi-stiff mash of the
mixture. Lay the bait during
late afternoon. About 1001 b. of
bait per acre is sufficient for

control, increased in proportion
according to the severity of the
infestation.
The vegetable weevil is just
as damaging, A dusting with
either a 25 per cent, calcium
arsenate dust or spraying with
lead arsenate (11b. of powder to
16gal. of water) will effectively
deal with them. The grubs
usually appear during early
spring. Dip all young plants in
the arsenate-of-lead solution
before planting out.
Here in east Gippsland we’re
subject to 3 more serious tomato
pest —the leaf-eating ladybird.
Several applications of a com-
bined arsenate-of-lead and nico-
tine dust (25 per cent, and 2 per
cent.) is necessary to quell them
once they get going on the
foliage. Vegetable-bugs attack
the plants in all stages of
growth. Pyrethrum dust and
pyrethrum dust with an equal
quantity of 5 per cent, nicotine
dust, mixed immediately before
use and applied freely to the
foliage with a dust-gun, are
effective in dealing with this
pest. Rutherglen bugs can be
similarly dealt with by the use
of a dust containing equal parts
of pyrethrum powder and 3 per
cent, nicotine dust, or a dust
containing 7 per cent, creosote
and 3 per cent, nicotine.
Losses of up to 50 per cent,
can result from failure to early
control the tomato moth. The
larvae enter the fruit via the
stem, or attack the buds and
flowers, besides destroying the
foliage. Each female moth lays
from 500 to 800 eggs. Use a
50 per cent, arsenate-of-lead
dust.
Hints for the Farm.
“Sundowner”: To true an oil-
stone use a piece of 21oz. glass,
lOin. by 4in., and a piece of
scythe stone. Pulverise the latter
and place about a spoonful of
the powder on the glass. Add
water and rub the stone until
the surface is ground flat. An
alternative is to grind on the
side of a grindstone, using plenty
of water.
“C.A.A.”: A virus disease of
garden plants characterised by
mottled leaves may be mini-
mised by applying a manorial
mixture every month or six
weeks at loz. per square yard.
Mix lib. of super, with lib. of
sulphate of ammonia, £lb. of
sulphate of potash and ioz. of
sulphate of iron.
“Weedexp”: Mention was
made (B. 30/8/’5O) of land-
holders being supplied with
hormone weed-killers at cost
price, freight-free, for the
destruction of Noogoora burr.
The Department of Lands (Q.)
has now extended this service to
include all weeds known to be
susceptible to hormones.
“Billjim”: A dog suffering
from distemper should b e
isolated. Wash its eyes with
bpracic solution and clean its
nose daily. Give light foods
such as soups, milk, raw vege-
tables, with plenty of clean
water. Vaseline on the nose
will prevent cracking and irrita-
tion of the skin. Two to four
sulphathiazole tablets, three or
four times a day, according to
size, will be helpful. If a vet.
be available, call him.
“Rooster”: Bacon carcasses
should have the correct propor-
tion of fat and lean at 1601 b. to
2301 b. liveweight (varying accord-
ing to home production or ex-
port requirements). To attain
this feed heavily to 701b.-801b.
weights in order to allow suf-
ficient muscle development.
Then restrict the ration a little
so the carcass doesn’t run to fat.
If a baconer is underfed early
or overfed late, it produces a
carcass with poor eye muscle and
heavy back fat —a market un-
desirable.
“Billjim”: A thin spray of
40 p.c. nicotine sulphate placed
on poultry-perches on a calm
day before the birds go to roost
will deal with lice. Give two or
three applications at weekly
intervals.
“W. Court”: August is the
best time for planting Lima
beans. They like a warm, moist
climate, and both dwarf and
climbing varieties are available.
The bush Limas grow up to 4ft.
high, and should be spaced 3ft.
apart. The beans may be sliced
up and cooked like French beans
when young. Or the pods may
be allowed to mature, the beans
then being removed and cooked
like broad-beans.
“Old Crab”; If you’re not too
sure of a particular cow’s milk
when sending milk (or cream)
to a factory, boil a little of it
first. If it curdles, toss it out.
“Big Billy”; Calcium cyanide
will destroy wax-moth in bee-
combs. Stack supers containing
the sorted combs on a bottom
board with a tight-fitting lid
covering the top super. Place a
tablespoonful "of calcium on a
piece of cardboard and push
under bottom board. As the
preparation *vill account for all
the lame but is not toxic to the
eggs, repeat operation every
month during the storage period.
If the applications are made in
an outdoor building don’t re-
enter it for 24 hours, and only
then when all windows and
doors have been opened for a
time to allow ventilation.

The Place of Devils.
THE legend and the dream-
ing of Nanmamnrootmee
the place of devils, as told by
the old man Goodoonoo of the
Mungerai-N’Galarkan tribes of
the Roper Valley.
In the Dreamtime an old devil
woman called Marm sat down in
the shade on the top of some
rocks at a place called Munja-
jawa, which the while man calls
Cave Creek.
And this old devil woman had
no eyes. And it was in the rain-
time, and the old woman had a
big mob of girls gathering and
bringing her the plums called
Woial. And the*old woman,
with a huge stone, was crushing
up the plums and seeds on the
rock. She was making a big
damper, called Abbait, out of
them. And she called to the
girls, “Bring more! And more
yet!” And as fast as the girls
brought her the plums, she went
on crushing and grinding them
on the stone.
And the old woman went on
crushing the plums until she had
ground a deep round hole in the
rock. And she made many heaps
of this damper and gave it to
the girls to eat. And there was
so much damper that the girls
could not finish it up, but after
eating of it they were all turned
into the devils called Marm.
And Jaleetjee is the name of
the rock with the big hole ground
in it, and all about it are the
heaps of damper which are now
turned into stone.
Suppose you were to camp in
this place of devils, you would
hear someone sing out. You
would look up among the rocks,
or in the grass. You would go
over to where the voice came
from. There would be no one
there. Then, from another place,
you would hear someone cutting
a tree for sugar-bag. You would
go over and there would be no
one.
These devils sing out from one
place, you go over, and they
sing out from another distant
place. Suppose you go alone
and camp in that place. You
see a fire through the trees. You
hear a piccaninny crying, you
hear the sound of talk-talk. You
go over, and there is nothing
there. Suppose you stay in that
place. You go mad. You never
find those devils Marm.
And all that country around
is called Woomboo, the country
of the devils.
The Stone-country Devil.
nr HE legend of Nabonkitkit
* the stone-country devil, ac-
cording to Nalul of the Djauan
tribe.
Once there were two black-
fellows who were brothers. And
the elder of the brothers, whose
name was Nabonkitkit, had two
lubras whom he kept hidden in
the bush.
One day the younger of the
brothers, whose name was
Kimurree, which means eagle,
was out hunting and found
these two lubras. When he re-
turned to the camp he said to
Nabonkitkit, “Brother, today I
found two lubras in the bush.
There is one for you and one
for me.”
“No,” said Nabonkitkit, “you
are too young to have a lubra.
I could not let you have one.
You are not a young man yet.
I is better that I have the two
of them. I am an old-man
blackfellow.”
Kimurree was quiet when he
heard these words and he said,
“All right, then. You are an
old man.” But not long after
this Kimurree came up to his
brother and said, “Brother, I
have found an eagle’s nest in a
tree and there are two young
eagles in the nest.”
“Where?” asked Nabonkitkit.
“Come and I’ll show you,”
said Kimurree.
Presently they came to a tree
which was not very high, but
which had an eagle’s nest, like
a platform of sticks, in its
branches.
“Climb up,” said Kimurree.
“It is not very high.”
And Nabonkitkit began to
climb up the tree, but, as he
climbed, the tree seemed to grow
taller. He stopped and called
down to his brother, “What is
the matter with this tree? I am
a long way from the ground
already.”
“Why,” called back Kimurree,
“you are not half-way up yet.
It looks a long way down to
you, but you are only a little
way above me.”
Nabonkitkit went on climbing
and climbing. The further he
climbed the higher the tree
seemed to grow. He heard his
brother calling from a long way
off that he still had not climbed
very far. Nabonkitkit went on
climbing and climbing and at
last he reached the platform of
the eagle’s nest. When he looked
down he saw that the ground
and his brother who was looking
up at him were a long way off.
And then he saw that, just be-
low him, a huge smooth knot
had grown out all round the
trunk of the tree.
And Nabonkitkit could not
see any way of getting down,
and then he knew that, while he
had been climbing, his brother
had sung the tree and made it
grow, and the huge knot to form
around the trunk.
“Ai, Ai, my brother,” he
heard Kimurree calling, “you
will never get down out of that
tree. There you will die. You
would not let me have one of
your lubras. Now you can watch
me take both of them away. I
am going a long way from here
now. 80-bo, my brother.”
And Nabonkitkit stayed on
the platform of sticks in the
tree aU through the rain-time, all
through the time that the grass
came tall and green over the
plains. He stayed there until the
grass was brown and whitening.
Then, in the time of the cold
weather, a great wind came up
and bent and shook the tree, and
tossed out the dry bones of
Nabonkitkit into the grass far
below.
And when the bones of
Nabonkitkit were thrown down
into the grass, they sat up, for
Nabonkitkit was a great doctor.
And Nabonkitkit began to put
flesh and sinews back on to his
arms and legs and body. For a
long time he crawled about and
caught lizards and centipedes
and little birds. He caught any-
thing that he could to eat until
he began to feel strong and his
flesh and muscles had grown
again. Then he stood up and
his face was like a skull with his
eyes burning in the sockets,
“Now,” he said, “I can follow
him.”
And Nabonkitkit set off on his
long journey. One day he met
a blackfellow who told him that
he had seen Kimurree with two
lubras pass that way a year ago.
And Nabonkitkit went on until
he came to a sandy country.
Here he met a blackfellow who
told him he had seen Kimurree
and two lubras going towards
the Yungmun country a long
while ago. Nabonkitkit went on
until he met a blackfellow who
said he had seen those three
people travelling a long time ago
towards the sea. And Nabon-
kitkit went on and on. As he
went he sang a song which the
blackfellows sing in their cor-
roborees, “I am hungry. I look
out for water. I look out for
sugar-bag, I have no lubra, no
mate. I must travel by myself
all the time.”
At last Nabonkitkit came to
the saltwater country which is
called Milingimbi. He followed
the salt water a long way round.
And one day he came upon his
brother Kimurree lying in the
shade of a tree and, a little way
off in the shade of another tree,
the two lubras were sitting.
And when Kimurree saw his
brother coming, he started to his
feet and said, “Good-day, my
brother. I had to go a long
walkabout with these two
lubras.”
“Yes,” said Nabonkitkit, “and
I have followed and tracked you
all the way and now it is you
who shall die.”
And with the stone-axe he
carried Nabonkitkit hit Kimur-
ree in the forehead, above and
between the eyes, and killed him.
And Nabonkitkit went over to
the two lubras and killed them
also.
“Now,” said Nabonkitkit, “I
have no brother and no lubras.
I will go through the stone-
country and the desert and look
out for water.” And as he went
he sang the song of Nabonkitkit
the stone-country devil. He
sang, “nai nai murungunna. nai
nai murungunna, nai nai mur-
ungunna, naboit-catchum murun-
gunna, girrigitnok, girrigitnok,
girrigitnok,’’ which means, I
have no lubra, no mate. I go
on a long walkabout. I must
travel always by myself.”

How to control onion-grass in a
lawn and a gravel drive?
Onion-grass can be controlled in a
lawn by repeated mowing, or in
garden-beds it is destroyed by the
working of the beds during the winter
months, but neither of these methods
of control would be applicable to the
weed in a gravel drive. The earth
carrying the bulbs should have been
discarded before the gravel was laid
down. This plant is usually not seri-
ously checked by spraying with the
ordinary weedicides, but if they are
applied sufficiently heavily they can
sterilise the ground and kill the bulbs.
Common salt, if applied at a suffi-
ciently heavy rate, would also kill
the bulbs. Usually it is a waste ot
time attempting to sieve out onion-
grass bulbs from soil during the
summer months. The weed should be
tackled during its growing period,
and working of garden-beds between
May and September should soon eli-
minate the pest.

Some particulars about Isadora
Duncan ?
She was an American dancer and
pioneer in the revival of Greek
classical poses and barefoot dances
with flowing draperies. Born in San
Francisco, in 1878, she had appeared
on the New York stage before
emigrating with her family. In 1901
she appeared in Paris, and at the
Theatre Sarah Bernhardt in 1903.
She won a reputation for her inter-
pretations of music by means of
dancing. Her life, however, was
marred by tragedy. In 1913 her two
children, with their nurse, were
drowned in the Seine at Neuilly as
the result of a motor accident; in
1921 she married the young Russian
poet Serge Yessenin, whom she
divorced two years later, and in 1927
she herself was killed while motoring.
Her memoirs, My Life, were pub-
lished in 1927.

A few particulars about Charles
Lever, a 19th-century English novel-
ist ?
Born in Dublin in 1806 of English
parents, his father was an architect.
He was educated privately and at
Trinity College, Dublin, where he
took a degree in medicine. He for-
sook medicine for literature when, in
1837, his first novel, Harry Lorrequer.
appeared serially in the “Dublin Uni-
versity Magazine” and was immedi-
ately successful. He later became
editor of the magazine, and gathered
around him the Irish wits and writers
of the time. He is chiefly remembered
for his rollicking tales of Irish hie,
such as Jack Hinton, Charles
O’Malley and Arthur O’Leary. In
latter life he lived on the Continent,
was British Consul at Spezia, and
died while at Trieste in 1872.

Nature of a form of demonstration
at public meetings known as Kentish
It is the name of a peculiar form
of applause at public dinners or
political meetings, produced by clap-
ping the hands in unison in a certain
rhythm. The effect is sometimes
heightened by stamping, and a cry
of “Rah” at intervals. It may mark
approval or serve as an interruption.
It probably originated in the Kentish
meetings protesting against Roman
Catholic emancipation (1818-29), and
has since been constantly used at
Protestant, Conservative or Orange
meetings, especially in Northern Ire-
land,

To what species does the Judas-tree
belong? . i .
It is the name applied popularly to
several trees, on one of which Judas
is said to have hanged himself. It is
given most commonly to Cersis sili-
quastrum. a leguminous tree found in
Southern Europe, and cultivated as
a hardy plant in Britain. The purple
flowers are papilionaceous, and show
before the leaves.

Who was Kosciusko, after whom
the NJS.W. mountain was named?
Tadeusz Kosciusko, a Polish soldier
and patriot, born in Lithuania in 1746.
A love affair drove him to the U.S.A.
in 1777, where he fought on the side
of the colonists. Returning to Poland
in 1786, he distinguished himself
against the Russian invaders in 1792.
When the revolution of 1794 broke
out he put himself at the head of the
national movement in Cracow, and
was appointed dictator and com-
mander-in-chief. At first victorious,
he was hemmed in by Russians and
Prussians at Warsaw, and, forced to
take the field, he was defeated and
taken prisoner at Maciejowice. Re-
leased two years later, he made some
further effort for the cause of Polish
independence without much success,
and retired to follow agricultural pur-
suits in France and Switzerland. He
died in 1817. Strzelecki named the
mountain.

What are preference shares?
In a joint-stock company, it is the
name given to shares entitled to a divi-
dend at a fixed rate before any divi-
dend is paid on other shares, but
with participation in the profits thus
limited. If the arrears of preference
dividend have to be paid before any
profits are divided amongst other
shareholders, the shares are called
“cumulative preference shares.” Some-
times a company issues “first-prefer-
ence” and * ‘second-preference” shares,
the latter ranking after the former.

What is a hypothesis ?
In general, a supposition, proposi-
tion or principle assumed as true for
the purpose of argument, in order to
draw conclusions or inferences for
proof of some point in question, or to
account for some occurrence. In
science it is a conjecture or tentative
theory adopted provisionally as a
guide in investigating phenomena.
If this conjecture is found after care-
ful tests and examination entirely
satisfactory in explaining the phe-
nomena in accordance with known
facts and principles it is accepted as
a scientific theory.

A MOONLIGHT NIGHT OUTBACK.
'Twas the silence of night—■
The pale moon did gleam
O’er the meadow’s hills
And a rippling stream.
While wafted out through

From its distant lair.
A beautiful night
Of the long years sped.
Fond memory lives;
Though the past is dead.

Transport
Despite “Transporticus” and his slide-
rule (B, 6/9/’5O), men actually on the job
often dredge up conclusions at variance
with, or in advance of, technological
dogma. As secretary-engineer of a West-
ralian country road district, with 20-odd
years of experience in all kinds of related
jobs to do with roads —contracting, earth-
moving, bridge-building, haulage, etc. —
I admire “T.’s” technical grasp of his
profession, but doubt some of his con-
clusions.
His trenchant criticism of damage done
by heavy road traffic in the U.S.A. is,
after all, really a criticism of the road,
not the traffic. I have never understood
how they expect to lay down a “skin” of
concrete, be it ever so reinforced, on
the earth’s surface, and then expect it to
carry heavy loads at speed. Experience
with the vagaries of concrete work of all
kinds rejects this idea, despite expert data
to the contrary —i.e., showing how it
should work out, on paper.
“T.” reports these roads cracking up
after five years. I’m not surprised, but
I would like “T.” to see an outstanding
example of a road which is really doing a
man-sized job—and has been for the last
10 years or so —and which doesn’t look
like cracking up: the Albany Highway,
linking Perth and Albany. Wheat and
super, trucks of a gross tonnage as high
as anything in the U.S.A. hammer this
road 24 hours a day, year in, year out,
as well as ordinary traffic of all descrip-
tion.
Three men and a three-ton Inter., of
ancient vintage (still running on gas),
maintain about 100 miles of this end of
the road, and a similar unit (or units)
looks after the other (Albany) end. The
total distance is about 260 miles. The
surface is blue-metal and bitumen, with
rock and gravel foundation.
Here in my own neck of the woods we
have a tannin-extract factory, treating the
wandoo timber with which the area
abounds. Their trucks, Macks with
Gardner diesels and semi-trailers, and
tandem-drive Fodens, pound along every
day over gravel roads—which I have to
maintain —with loads grossing 25 tons
and more, and have been doing so for
12 years now. No appreciable difference,
other than for the better, is apparent in
these roads —in fact, given proper atten-
tion, they stand up to it better than the
bitumen. That attention is inexpensive,
if done persistently, and amounts to little
more than grading with power-grader
at a cost of about 10s. per hour, including
everything.
Regravelling can be done for ss. per
cubic yard spread, using from 20 to 35
yards per chain, depending on circum-
stances.
On the last stretch of nine miles (gravel),
which is a bottleneck, of course, more
than 100 tons of wandoo is carted per
week to the factory alone. The total
tonnage per week is many times more
than the railways could ever hope to
handle here. Fifty per cent, of the State’s
entire tonnage of wheat and super, last
year was carted by road —an impressive
performance, although the trucks could
cart it all if they were allowed.
I cannot, therefore, agree with “T.’s”
conclusions, and, whatever the conditions
prevailing in U.S.A., would cheerfully
undertake to support traffic on our roads
until the crack of doom. The road trans-
port hasn’t yet been built on pneumatic
tyres that can break up roads when they
are made of the proper material and
backed by mother earth itself. —R. H. G.
(W.A.).
The Lalrobe Library
Remember the blight that descended
on Victorian education in the 1930’s
under the Dunstan-Cain Government?
No school - buildings, no money for
equipment, teachers’ salaries kept at
starvation wage. Well, the present
McDonald - Cain Government the
unholy alliance of C.P. and Labor—
seems to have started on the same path.
One of its first acts was to shelve the
scheme for the Latrobe Library.
The Latrobe Library is to be founded
on the same lines as the Mitchell Library,
of Sydney, not only to house Australian
historical documents, but also works of
Australian literature and the arts. It will
serve not only historical students but
creative workers in all fields who wish
to draw inspiration from their own
country. It would also serve, quite as
widely, the general reader.
It may be argued that those things can
be done within the walls of the Public
Library, but those walls are already
bulging. The collections of Australiana
and the documents which have been
offered to the new institution devoted to
such things were not offered and, in many
cases, will not be offered to the all-
purpose library, which has neither room
nor the staff to handle them adequately.
In 1951 Victoria will be 100 years of
age. To the centenary committee formed
to organise the celebration of the separa-
tion of Port Phillip from N. S. Wales
and its establishment as the colony of
Victoria, Professor R. M. Crawford,
Professor of History at the Melbourne
University, suggested in 1949 that a per-
manent memorial to the founders of the
State in the form of a library, to be
called the Latrobe Library, should be
founded. It should contain only Aus-
traliana —the official archives of the
State, diaries and letters of pioneers,
historical material.
A sub-committee of the centenary
committee, including representatives from
the Board of Trustees of the Public
Library and the Public Works Depart-
“Why don't they arrange these blackouts after
everybody's gone to bed?"
ment and Professor Crawford, submitted
plans and an estimate of costs in March,
1950. In June, 1950, these plans were
submitted to Mr. Hollway, the then
Premier. He enthusiastically agreed on
the broad principles, and indicated that
the Government would back any move to
further the educational needs of the
State. It was not proposed that a vast
new building should be built at once. It
was agreed that a beginning should be
made next year by way of excavation and
the setting of a foundation-stone, and that
the work should continue over a period
of four to five years.
When the McDonald-Cain Govern-
ment wormed its way into office in June,
1950, the plans were resubmitted. They
were rejected and tossed into a pigeon-
hole.—J. F. R. (Vic.).
Living Costsl
“Dick Turpin” (B. 14/6/’5O) may
well feel perturbed, for it is a moral
certainty that the state he deplores will
end in trouble. We seem to be following
very much the same pattern as we did
after 1918 —which led to instability,
slumps and depressed areas.
Between 1918 and 1923 Welsh coal-
miners in particular ruined the British
export coal trade which was one of the
last golden eggs left in the basket. Britain
has never recovered from that blow dealt
by trade-unionism.
Australian coal industrial leaders are
doing exactly the same thing. And
although Australia is better equipped to
balance her economy than was Britain
—being able to feed her population with
lots to spare—the damage that is being
done by promoting the artificial standards
which lead to inflation cannot be disre-
garded.
So far, a seller’s market, from which
Australia has been able to profit perhaps
more than any other nation, has gone to
the head of the industrial leaders. They
are under the false impression that good
times can last for ever.
What do they get out of it? Pounds
which decrease in purchasing-power
every day—the cost of an ounce of gold
today will buy no more than when gold
was £4.6 an ounce. That is a shining
example of the value of the paper cur-
rency today.
Too much superfluous money is being
flung about to foster unproductive ven-
tures. What is spent upon necessities of
life spreads into every corner of industry
and helps to keep the wheels turning. But
the third which is superfluous goes in
gambling, racing, dogs, lotteries and what
not. Most of it goes to the few and helps
nobody but him who wins it—a split frac-
tion of the community.
By its demands, which promote infla-
tion, labor of the extreme variety is
making a rod for its own back, and things
will never improve until its makers feel
the weight of it. — Shellback (N.S.W.).
Farmers
Judged by conditions in this part of
western Victoria farmers are an im-
provident lot. Following a dry spell
which had extended through the autumn
to early winter stock in dairying districts
are in a critical plight because of lack of
green- and, in many instances, stored feed.
This hardship is being passed on to
townsfolk in the cutting of milk-supplies
to one-half of normal use.
Although farmers must realise that
even in this excellent rainfall area dry
periods must come sooner or later, little
or no provision is made to meet them.
In only isolated cases can one go to a
dairyfarm which has stored feed in the
form of hay or silage in any quantity.
Why? Is it an attitude.of mind, a gamble
on a succession of favorable seasons, or
is it merely that farmers won’t be
bothered adopting any conservation
practice?
The same arguments apply to water.
For the most part land-owners in this part
of the State are content to wait for the
rains. Dams and windmills are few and
far between. If the rains don’t come in
due season the farmers are in Queer-

Vegetable Profits
Greengrocers are asking for increased
allowances per case and bushel on fruit
and vegetables to recompense them for
their present enormous outlay and result-
ing loss-risk and decreased sales. Their
argument holds good in the face of per-
centages. Beans at one shilling a pound
return approximately threepence profit.
At those prices, well within the public’s
pocket, it can be expected that many
pounds will be sold and a good profit
returned. If the same profit is made on
the same pound of beans at three shillings
a pound the decreased sales reduce the
profits. Likewise, for every pound lost,
12 have to be sold to break square.
Again, cabbages and the like, when dear,
are halved and quartered, thus halving
and quartering each individual profit on
a sale.
Shops facing big rentals are the hardest
hit by these conditions, and many are
being converted into other types of busi-
nesses that are a little more stable. This
position, arising as it does from climatic
conditions and disorganised transport
facilities, is to be lamented, and it is hard
to inflict on the already overburdened
public the additional charges that appear
to follow any granting of additional
profits to greengrocers. However, costs
along the line of production have soared
enormously, and a little investigation
centred around this section could redirect
some of the surplus profit to the retailer.
Speculators, huge semi-trailer transports
and some unscrupulous marketers com-
bine to claim the cream that belongs to
the grower and seller.
Unfair controls add their kicks to the
man who’s down. The latest blow was
the increase in the wholesale price
of potatoes by £2 a ton with no increase
in the retail. It was hard to break even on
the murphies at a pound before the
increase ; now they represent a sure dead-
loss. Is it any wonder that the house-
holder is often greeted with “Sorry, no
spuds,” when no shortage exists?
As a worse example, “Sorry, no onions
to strangers,” seems to be the motto
today. While other States allow higher
charges the N. S. Wales growers would be
foolish to accept our pittance. Black-
marketers have the game by the throat,
transporting the tear-jerkers surrepti-
tiously down by truck and selling them
outside the markets at four to five pounds
a bag. Mrs. Housewife, faced with pay-
ing Is. Bd. a bunch for spring onions
about the size of peanuts, eagerly takes
the real onion on the black at around a
bob a pound.
Taken right through, our vitamin prob-
lem has an indelicate aroma, and unless
radical changes occur very shortly it will
be a case of grow your own or marry a
farmer’s daughter.— Ebrius (N.S.W.).
Turkey
While the present Turkish Govern-
ment merits praise for the promptness
with which it has offered troops for
service in Korea, it is not the same Gov-
ernment that ruled Turkey since Kemal
came to power (B. 9/8/’5O). That Gov-
ernment was swept from office a few
months ago in the first free election held
in Turkey since the Kemalist revolution.
Kemal’s pupil and successor Ismet Inonu
and his Socialist-minded following suf-
fered severe defeat by a party that is
roughly the Turkish equivalent of the
Australian Liberal party.
The record of Inonu and his associates
was nothing to boast of as regards ful-
filment of international obligations.
Turkey had an understanding with Britain
which provided for Turkish assistance if
Britain was attacked by a Mediterranean
Power. When Mussolini joined Hitler
Inonu took advantage of an escape-clause
under which Turkey was not obliged to
come to the help of Britain if such action
risked involving her in conflict with
Soviet Russia. Even after Russia was
Britain’s ally Turkey kept out of the war.

Social Service
Many of us will pay social-service tax
all our lives and never receive any bene-
fit or expect any, regarding such contri-
butions as community service. There are,
however, certain people who really need
and deserve pensions, but are debarred
by ridiculous regulations regarding
possessions.
Such a case came under my notice
when making up an income-tax return.
An old lady in her 9Gth year, a widow
for 13 years, owns a small cottage, whose
assessed capital value is £425. She lives
in two rooms and lets two for 21s. a week.
She also owns two small conjoined
cottages let at 395. and valued at £BOO.
These were left her by her mother. The
total annual rent she receives is £156, and
rates, land tax and insurance take out
£35. All places are very old, and last
year she paid £25 for repairs. Con-
sequently her income for last year was
£96.
She could have an income or earn 30s.
a week and get a full pension of £2 2s. 6d.
The extra income she had last year
would reduce her pension to £1 16s. 6d. a
week. She would be in clover on a
pension of even £1 a week, but because
she owns property of a value exceeding
£750 she is debarred from any pension at
all.—E. A. B. (Tas.).
Poets* Corner
It gets my goat to read of a Poets’
Corner being planned as “the most fitting
memorial” to home-grown verse-
writers. A recent broadcast ended by
saying the proposed Poets’ Corner would
perhaps “compensate the [now-dead] poet
for the hard things life did to him.” Well,
wouldn’t it be better to soften the lot of
the would-be poets who are still alive ?
Why not honor the dead by giving more
space to the living? Let each daily paper
set aside one column per day, calling it
by some poet’s name —the Lawson
Column, etc. Let all Sunday rags run a
similar weekly feature. And don’t let the
staff-writers fill the column ; leave it open
to the hungry horde. Also, don’t stuff it
with wordy verse of the brilliant but ob-
scure type. Let the ballad-writers in.—
Eve Merritt (N.S.W.)


TALKIES
"BicycSe Thieves."
Bicveils might be credited with many
with being the delight and ambi-
>i small boys, with being extremely
uring transport strikes and with
en masse, totally unnerving to
■ • iesrria# and motorists alike. But,
■ hatever might be seen in them, it is very
dC,ult to see them as a symbol of
: edy, and. that is the obstacle which
' v cc rues up against in “Bicycle Thieves”
by Savoy, an Italian film made by
tone De Sica, who was also respon-
vb e f< r “Shoeshine.”
the ficycle belongs to an unemployed
Li; in post-war Rome and becomes
: >e c. d to him when he gets a job as a
;v c - ' er. He gets it out of pawn by
g the family’s bedclothes, but it is
stolen an his first day at work, and the
mainly taken up with the search
. oy himself and his son over most
of the city. Although he finds the thief
he cannot prove the theft and goes sadly
home to his half-starved wife with his
small son firmly clutching his hand.
To director De Sica’s credit, he almost
gets away with it; that is, he almost gets
away with blowing up a sad little sketch
of poverty into tragedy. But not quite.
All his skilful use. of crowds, of light and
<hade and towering modern buildings set
i t desolate empty spaces ; his search
oi dim twisted streets and old rooms and
his re> ord of crowded busy market-places
of that quite conceals the fact
©f a r cture made on the cheap by going
roamii,| around Rome with a couple of
:,wr? and a camera.
D Sica might successfully have taken
his idience for a ride were he not such
a sad, sad man —before the search is
hail-done it is evident that he is more
concr red with a, sad song of poverty
than with human beings and human
ham a and one finally goes out with the
impression of having heard a solemn,
slight!v political sermon on the sufferings
of i: , poor instead of even a small cry
of pain.
Ora also suspects De Sica’s “artistry”
; se oral places—close-ups with heavy
Widows to conceal the eyes and accent
the cheeks and nose; an opera-like con-
don on hand-wringing and ex-
cessions of fear and -bewilderment; and
a lingering on pictorial composition.
Those things, like “artistic restraint,”
have been used so often and are so
familiar that* they begin to look more
like technical devices than hallmarks of
artistry, particularly when they are used
with such ready facility as they are in
this film.
The main actors in the film fit their
parts with the same slick naturalness as
their surroundings. Lianella Carell, as
the wife, is weary, hard-working and a
little desperate, and Lambert© Maggiorani,
as the husband, very much under the
control of the director and the story, is
vwv grim—rather like Humphrey Bogart
mi a slightly more fluent Adam’s apple.
T • Sli iola, as the son, behaves like a
ly intelligent small boy.
Among other credits, the film is re-
ported to have been judged in Belgium
as the best film of the year. One may
derive some consolation in the fact that
the Belgians are very fond of bicycles
anyway.
"Crisis."
M.-G.-M., which runs the St. James,
Liberty and Minerva in Sydney, seems,
with odd exceptions, to have taken to
changing its programmes almost fort-
nightly, and, since the company’s pro-
ductions generally range from f.a.q. to
pretty good, it can only be assumed that
it is embarrassed with the quantity rather
than the quality of its output.
That assumption is supported by
“Crisis,” which had a brief spin at the
St. James before it was whisked off on
the rounds. It has to do with a skilled
neurological surgeon who is shanghaied,
along with his wife, to a small Latin
American State to perform a delicate
brain operation on an unloved dictator.
A simmering revolution provides the main
background for the events, which are
“A three-letter Word —you say it's ‘ape,’ I say it’s ‘man.’ ”
spun into some mildly interesting compli-
cations when it becomes evident that the
dictator’s death would not be greatly
mourned, that the doctor is made acutely
aware of this by the suggestion that his
patient should snuff out under the opera-
tion, and that the op. may prove un-
successful, anyway, because of lack of
skilled staff and facilities. To complicate
matters a little further, the doctor’s wife
is kidnapped and her life held as hostage
for that of the dictator.
Cary Grant makes a nice fist of the
doctor, despite the occasional impression
he gives of omnipotence by controlling
events which should be controlling him.
That old master Jose Ferrer naturally
has no trouble with the airs and manners
of a Latin dictator, and Ramon Novarro
makes a useful contribution to the general
characterisation as the leader of the
rebels. Paula Raymond provides an ex-
cellent wife for surgeon Grant.
Also released along with “Crisis,’
“Please Believe Me” presents a quadri-
lateral instead of the usual triangle with
a con. man, a playboy and lawyer at three
points and a supposedly wealthy heiress
at the other. The variations in the course
and the humor of the hunters' spot some
mild amusement into the chase, which
takes in a boat trip, hotel apartments,
lawyers’ offices, gambling joints, expensive
shops, with even a Texas ranch included
for some not-very-clear reason. Deborah
Kerr, Robert Walker, Peter Lawford and
Mark Stevens manipulate the piece
lightly enough.
"Saints and Sinners."
There is, indeed, a lot of delightful
comeay to be bad from this little bit
of Irish mischief at Sydney Embassy—
a rather blandly told story of an Irish
village to which a young man returns
after two years in jail determined to prove
that he did not steal the funds for the
new bell for the church.
He has several things to contend with,
including the beautiful blonde wife of an
Irish American returned Jiome to shed
a tear over his mother’s grave, the dark
little daughter of the publican who loves
him but doesn’t believe in his innocence,
and the obvious hostility of the villagers.
To assist him he has the friendship of
the canon and the affection of Ma Mur-
naghan, a charmin’ old lady who smokes
a pipe and makes awesome, accurate pro-
phecies about such things as the winners
of horse-races and the day of the end of
the world.
And, in case you might think that
there’s an air of naturalness about the
scene and the people—well, the names
of the players are Manahan, Dolan,
O’Neill, Moore, Dillon and Purcell.
There are no pigs and no lepre-
chauns, but they are not very far away.
"The Broken Arrow."
In the good old days one went happily
along believing that there was a Father
Christmas, that schoolteachers were not
human and that there were good cow-
boys and bad Indians. Having spotted
Father Christmas, and having drunk beer
with schoolteachers, one now needs only
to go along to Sydney Plaza and discover
that all Indians aren’t bad and all white
men aren’t good.
That, of course, is elementary enough,
but is a state of affairs which James
Stewart has to discover for himself when
called upon to make peace between
warring Apaches and American settlers.
The Indians, except for a couple of
rebellious odds-and-sods, including the
notorious Gerpnimo, are depicted as a
fairly saintly bunch who only waylay
caravans and Uncle Sam’s mail in the
cause of defending their own territory;
the whites, except for a benign old
general and James Stewart, are repre-
sented by an untrustworthy crowd
who seem to believe that the only thing
to do with an Indian is shoot him.
It falls to Mr. Stewart, as an Indian
scout, to negotiate a truce between these
oddly assorted factions, which he contrives
to do, as well as marrying as pretty a
little redskin as ever decorated a choco-
late-box. Neither her marriage nor her
looks, however, can save the young
beauty from being foully murdered by
some villainous whites, a crime which,
in some complicated way, ensures that
thereafter there will be peace between
Uncle Sam and the Apaches.
It’s all in technicolor. Mr. Stewart
goes his stumbling, hesitating way, and
Jeff Chandler, with a commendable Kiwi
tan, exudes dignity and wisdom as the
Indian chief.
"No Sod Songs for Me."
This Columbia picture released at Mel-
bourne Savoy is another of those stories
which posit an insoluble problem. It is
our old friend the eternal triangle, with
a difference. The difference is that the
supplanted wife (Margaret Sullivan) is
already under sentence of death when
she learns that her engineer-husband
(Wendell Corey), engaged on some great
dam-building project, has succumbed to
the charms of a feminine assistant.
Her death sentence comes from the fad
that she has inoperable cancer and has
been given only 10 months to live. She
keeps the knowledge of her illness from
her husband and tries to hide its ravages
from him. The average jealous woman
would use it to her own advantage to
gain the consideration of her husband
even at her last gasp, but not so the wife
in this film. She feels that the othef
woman will make her husband a good
wife and decides to give him to her.
After an abortive attempt at suicide she
allows the doctor’s prognosis to work itself
out. Whether this is good psychology is
doubtful, but Miss Sullivan makes it
seem so by a magnificent performance.
The History of Mr. Polly had no point
in the novel by H. G., Wells, and it has no
point in the screen version at Melbourne
Athenaeum. A series of accidents deter-
mines the history of the freedom-loving
Mr. Polly. An accident lands him into
marriage with a singularly unprepossess-
ing female and an accident gets him out
of it when, to rid himself of the wife who
bores him, he decides to burn his shop
down and then commit suicide. The pre-
mature lighting-up of the conflagration
prevents his fulfilling the second part of
his programme, and, like Bill Sikes, he
starts to run away from justice. An
accident lands him in a comfortable job
in a country inn whose widowed land-
lady is being tyrannised over by an in-
credibly brutal uncle. Mr. Polly finds
himself cast in the role of dragon-slayer
to the beleaguered lady, but he has no
taste for Sir Galahading. The providen-
tial exploding of a gun removes the
uncle, and as he happens to be wearing
Mr. Polly’s trousers that timid little
fellow is “found drowned” at the inquest.
Thus he gets the inn, the lady and his
freedom in one stroke, and in the final
close-up is revealed fishing and contem-
plating the sunset. Mr, Wells may have
dreamt Mr. Polly and his history, but he
certainly never observed him. The fact
that John Mills doesn’t make him live is
no fault of John Mills.
