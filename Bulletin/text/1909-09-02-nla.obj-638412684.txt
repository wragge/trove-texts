To show the value of Langebek’s Pepsin Extract,
and.its superiority over all other forms of Pepsin
on the market, we quote the following authentic
testimonial:
“Of Pepsin preparations I can particularly
quote the ‘Pepsinum Langebek,’ which was pre-
viously strongly recommended by Professors
Contain and Semmola. I have used this Pepsin
on a large scale in many cases of Indigestion,
Anremia, Chlorosis, and Neurasthenia, and was
very pleased to find that these diseases were
very promptly cured by the help of this
medicament.
“ I remember especially two cases where other
Pepsin had been used without success, but the
result of the use of Langebek’s Pepsin entirely
restored them to health.”

John Masefield
Amongst the English writers of to-day who
derive their inspiration from the sea, John
Masefield occupies a high place for versa-
tility, vigor and charm of style. In all save
constructive ability he rivals Joseph Conrad,
that gifted Pole who writes such excel-
lent English. It is difficult to be original
about such hoary themes as the" sea
and those who go down to it in
ships, unless you have original matter
in you as well as the artistic faculty.
Masefield has both. He entered the mer-
chant service as a boy, and knocked about in
various parts of the world. Having a keen
eye for color and character, and a memory
for any good yarns he heard, Masefield came
back to England primed with rich material
and discovered that he could write.
He had the advantage also of wide reading.
He is perhaps as well informed as any man
in the literature relating to the sea, has com-
piled a very readable account of Drake and
the buccaneers On the Spanish Main, a his-
tory of Sea Life in Nelson’s Time, and an
anthology of sea songs called A Sailor’s
Garland. He has also edited Dampier,
Hakluyt and Marco Polo ; besides Marlowe’s
JOHN MASEFIELD.
Dr. Faustus, Keats, Herrick, and a little-
known book of fistic lore, The Fancy , by-
Reynolds, the friend of Keats. For some
years he wrote the book reviews for the
Daily Neivs, and had occasion not long ago
to deliver judgment upon Australian poetry,
when lie named Brady and Paterson as the
most remarkable of the native-born poets,
Gordon and Francis Adams as the best
of the aliens, and selected Essex Evans from
the rest of the bunch as having the most
music and the finest accomplishment. Mase-
field has also written a couple of plays
which have been acted but not yet published.
Masefield began as a poet; publishing Salt
Water Ballads in 1902, and Ballads in 1908.
There is an unmistakable poetic quality
about these ballads. They are musical ; they
are picturesque. Some of them have the
salt flavor of capstan chanties ; others are
filled with airs from the Spanish Main.
A never-fading charm hangs about that
sea-track between the Old World and A merica,
and the,mighty deeds that were done upon
it in the spacious days of Drake and Haw-
kins, Morgan and Captain Kidd, grow in
interest as sea life becomes more orderly and
the sailor man more respectable. Romance
writers, aware of this, have made as much gold
out of it as was ever sunk in the galloons
which litter its floor. Masefield would have
a larger share of the dividend if he wrote
worse. His prose sketches and stories—A
Mainsail Haul and A Tarpaulin Muster—
.are not sufficiently lurid to be widely popular.
They are artistically turned episodes, anec-
dotes and character studies of seamen, and
the latter volume includes two or three Irish
fairy stories which are not in the least incon-
gruous, for the spirit of all is that of wonder
and appreciation of the beauty and mystery
of the world. “A Memory” pictures a
never-to-be-forgotten sight of a splendid
ship in the dawn :
The thing was so beautiful it could not be a
chance, a mere event, finite, a thing of a day.
Like all beautiful things, it is a symbol of all
beauty, a hand flinging back the window, the
touch bringing the grass blade from the seed, the
fire destroying Troy. All lovely things have that
symbolic power, that key of release. One has but
to fill the mind and to meditate upon a lovely
thing to pass out of this world, where the best is
but a shadow, to that other world, the world of
beauty “where the golden blossoms burn upon
the trees for ever.”
While touching the glamor of Yeats in
some of his sketches, his stories vibrate with
actuality, and his characters have as much
genuine humor, blasphemy and naturalness
as any of their kind in fiction. Captain
Margaret, his first novel, presents a group of
vigorous ruffians on the “Broken Heart,”
who go out to the Isthmus of Darien with
the ship’s owner, a white-handed dreamer
and adventurer. At the moment of
sailing they have thrust upon them the
charming woman through whom Captain
Margaret is suffering a “ broken heart,” and
her unspeakable husband, who is flying
from the law. With many good qualities
Captain Margaret cannot, however, be con-
sidered a success. The situation is an extra-
ordinary one, and the self-denying ordinances
of Captain Margaret very unusual; but the
voyage is interesting, and even though the
psychological study sometimes overrides the
romance, and a modern air blows into the
piratical atmosphere, the book is worth read-
ing.
Masefield’s latest experiment in fiction,
Mxdtitude and Solitude (Sydney Book
Club), is stronger, more coherent and better
constructed. It is also something out of
the way in fiction. The sea occupies no
place in it, and of action there is very little
till the end. The woman who pervades the
whole story does not appear at all ; she
dies midway ; but her influence works in
the principal characters and drives her lover
from a self-indulgent life as a literary artist
in London to fight the plague of sleeping-
sickness in Africa. The story begins with
the condemnation of the lover’s play by a
first-night audience. The ape-like character
of the multitude, the recasting of his views
on art by the disgusted writer, and the subtle
influence of suggestions which catch him on
the rebound from the failure of his play and
the death of the girl, and turn him to a life
of practical purpose, are well brought out.
He did not believe in mixing art with propa-
ganda, but he agrees with the indictment o
modern artists by a scientific friend :
They seem to me to be a company of men with
out any common principle or joint enthusiasm
working rather blindly and narrowly at the
bidding of personal idiosyncrasy, or of some aber
ration of taste. A few of you, some of the mos
determined, are interested in social reform. The
rest of you are merely photographing what goes
on for the amusement of those who canno :
photograph.
In moments of self-despising he saw himself
, . . like an old king surprised by death in the
treasure-house. He had piled up many jewels oi
many-gleaming thought; he was robed in purple ;
his brain was heavy from the crown’s weight. And
all of it was a heavy uselessness.
Whereas his enthusiastic scientific friend
. . . was a crusader, dying outside the Holy
City, perhaps not in sight of it, but so fired with
the idea of it that death was a little thing to him.
All his life had been death for an idea. All his
life had made dying easier.
And so the two of them go out to tackle the
tsetse fly. In that way, at any rate, they
may be able to serve their fellows. The
African part of the book is well done.
There is a vivid description of a tropi-
cal storm, and a detailed account of
the progress and treatment of the plague,
in which the reader becomes thoroughly
interested. The book, however, is not one
for the multitude. Its appeal is to those
who are concerned about the question of the
Artist Militant and attracted by literary
style. The staccato effect of a succession of
short sentences, the broad sweep of some
descriptive passages, and the careful finish of
the whole show. Masefield to be a master of
his art.
Clarke's Preface to Gordon’s
Poems
A new edition of Gordon’s Sea Spray and
Smoke Drift, with a preface by Walter Mur-
doch (T. C. Lothian), recalls the fact that
Marcus Clarke’s famous preface was first
printed with the second edition of Sea
Spray, etc., in 1876. In has since appeared
in all editions of Gordon’s collected poems,
and is likely to be the only specimen of
Clarke’s minor writings that will last along
'with Ilis Natural Life. The influence of
this brief article has been far greater than
anything else of the same kind written in
Australia, and it is worth while to ascertain
what is its real worth.
Gordon published four volumes of verse
— The Feud (1864), Sea Spray, etc. (1867),
Ashtaroth (1867), and Bush Ballads and
Galloping Rhymes (1870). He shot him-
self on the 24th June, 1870, the morning
after the publication of the last-named
volume. Bush Ballads was reprinted in 1876,
followed by Sea Spray (with Clarke’s pre-
face) in the same year, and Ashtaroth in
1877. Yet Clarke wrote in the first para-
graph of his essay:
The success of his republished “collected”
Poems gave him courage, and the unreserved
praise which greeted Bush Ballads should have
urged him to forget or to conquer those evil
promptings which, unhappily, brought about hia
untimely death.
As no “ collected” edition, in the ordinary
sense, was printed in Gordon’s lifetime, Sea
Spray and Smoke Drift is apparentty in-
tended ; but its publication, instead Of being
a success, was a discouraging failure. Thus
Walter Murdoch : “To say that the little
book was coldly welcomed by the Aus-
tralian press is to misstate the facts ; it was
not welcomed at all. A few copies were sold,
but not nearly enough to pay the printer’s
bill.” And the failure of Ashtaroth was even
more emphatic.
A few advance copies of Bush Ballads were
issued, and Kendall got one to review for
The Australasian. On the 23rd June Gordon
saw a proof of Kendall’s review, which cer-
tainly gave the volume unreserved praise :
but that was not sufficient to make him
“ forget or conquer those evil promptings”
long dormant in his mind. He met Kendall
on the same day, discussed poetry and sui-
cide, and went home with the printer’s bill
in his pocket, to make an end next morning.'
\t/
Clarke speaks of Gordon quitting his pros-
pects of success in the British army, and
emigrating because there was then no sign of
war; whereas he left unwillingly, at his
father’s request, because of a boyish escapade
and a love affair.
He went to S. Australia, and started as a sheep
farmer. His efforts were attended with failure.
He lost his capital, and owning nothing but a love
for horsemanship and a head full of Browning and
Shelley, plunged into the varied life which gold
mining, “ overlanding, ” and cattle-driving affords.
If Clarke had said “Browning and
Byron,” it would have been nearer the
mark. Gordon did not care for Shelley, and
probably read very little of him—but that
may pass. Gordon realty started as a
mounted trooper, and afterwards worked as a
horse-breaker. He never attempted gold
mining, overlanding or cattle-driving.
The reputation of the book (Sea Spray) spread
to England, and Major Whyte Melville did
not disdain to place the lines of the dashing Aus-
tralian author at the head of his own dashin o,
descriptions of sporting scenery. Unhappily the
melancholy which Gordon’s friends had with pain
observed increased daily, and in the full flood of
his success, with congratulations pouring upon
him from every side, he was found dead in the
heather near his home with a bullet from his own
rifle in his brain.
Gordon sent a copy of Sea Spray to
Whyte Melville, whose work he greatly
admired, and to whose Songs and Verses
he owed more than one suggestion,
for which he paid handsomely' in the
dedication of his Bush Ballads. Mel-
ville’s appreciative reply is printed in
Ross’s memoir of Gordon. Beyond the
chapter-head quotations referred to, and
one or two newspaper reviews of Sea Spray,
practically nothing of Gordon’s work was
known in England for many years ; in fadt,
it did not begin to have a reputation there
until after the publication of Patchett
Martin’s articles in Temple Bar (1884) and
elsewhere. “The flood tide of success,” etc.,
in view of the facts, seems ironic. Though
Clarke knew Gordon personalty, being one
of the few friends the poet had won through
his poems, it is easy to understand that he
knew little or nothing of Gordon’s career,
for Gordon was a particularly proud and re-
served man. The errors of fact are therefore
pardonable ; but a correcting note should be
printed in future editions.
The next two paragraphs of the preface,
while disclaiming criticism, say just the
right word about Gordon, and quote the
best stanzas of Gordon’s most Australian
poem. That “ the beginnings of a national
school of Australian poetry ” are to be found
in Gordon’s poems, as Clarke stated, is
due mainly to the presence there of “ The
Sick Stockrider.”
The fame of Clarke’s preface does not,
however, depend upon the service he
rendered to Gordon in that part of it ; but
upon the concluding portion in which he
answers his own question—What is the
dominant note of Australian scenery ? He
there gathered together some of the peculiar
features of this country, upon which the new
chum when writing about Australia has
always thrown the high-light of his amaze-
ment, and made the place appear like
a freak museum. And he thei’e fastened
weird melancholy upon our scenery, where it
remained for a generation. Newcomers still
expect to find Australia a land of topsy-
turvydom, and go into the bush prepared to
discover in the unoffending gum-trees a weird
melancholy which they might have found
more easily in the London slums.
Not so long ago Hoderic Quinn on this page
varied the dominant note to “weird ex-
pectancy,” a note discovered independently
by Gertrude Atherton (The Aristocrats) in
the forests of America. In Europe, which
Clarke refers to as “the home of knightly
song, of bright deeds and clear morning
thought,” every forest was full of mystery
before the railway and the electric light ran
through them ; and European literature is
studded with stories of the weird and gro-
tesque features of the European Bush, of
spots more fearsome than Kendall’s “ Ghost
Glen ” or “ Cooranbean,” of vampires, were-
wolves and demons lurking in their depths,
which put our poor innocent bunyip to
shame.
Weird melancholy, like beauty, resides in
the eye of the beholder. The character which
Clarke read into Australian scenery he saw
in his mind’s eye, as he saw the Future
Australian Hace. His knowledge of “the
wild dreamland termed the Bush,” was
slight—(he makes the mopokes “ burst into
horrible peals of semi-human laughter ”) ;
but he must have known that the influence
of the Bush upon Gordon’s poetry was very
small indeed. And in the few poems which
do convey some element of Bush influence,
the melancholy note is absent. The stanzas
quoted by Clarke from “The Sick Stock-
rider,” for example, begin :
’Twas merry in the glowing morn.
Francis Adams, in an essay which should
be read by every admirer of Gordon, said that
he hoped Marcus Clarke’s preface would
always be printed with the poems. It de-
serves preservation as a brilliant piece of
“ fine writing” of historical importance, and
as an early appreciation of the real merit of
Gordon’s work. It should, however, be
accompanied by a statement of the facts of
Gordon’s life as set forth in Alex. Suther-
land’s memoir, and a misprint repeated ever
since 1876 might be corrected. In the sen-
tence “ Wrapped in the midst of early morn-
ing her history looms vague and gigantic,”
mist was plainly intended. And certain errors
in the poems, slavishly repeated in every
edition, ought to be removed. In “ Whis-
perings in Wattle Boughs,” for instance,
‘ ‘ but his beloved sleep Can never be disturb’d
by such as thou,” should be “ His beloved’s
sleep. Lothian’s edition of Sea Spray and
Smoke Drift departs from Gordon’s capitals
in these lines, but preserves the original
error. It also adds a few more errors of its
own—“ thron’d ” for “throng’d” in The
Legend of Madrid, and two or three other
misspellings, As this book is out of copy-
right, a complete and correct edition of
Gordon ought to be possible before long.

Oh some are fond of red wine, and some are fond

And some are all for dancing by the pale moon-

But rum alone’s the tipple, and the heart’s delight
Of the old bold mate of Henry Morgan.

But I’m for right Jamaica till I roll beneath the

Oh some are for the lily and some are for the rose,
But I am for the sugar-cane that in Jamaica grows,
For it’s that that makes the bonny drink to warm
my copper nose,
Says the old bold mate of Henry Morgan.
Oh some are fond of fiddles, and a song well sung,
And some are all for music for to lilt upon the

But mouths were made for tankards and for
sucking at the bung.
Says the old bold mate of Henry Morgan.
Oh some are fond of dancing, and some are fond of
dice,
And some are all for red lips, and pretty lasses’
eyes;
But a right Jamaica puncheon is a finer prize
To the old bold mate of Henry Morgan.
Oh, some that’s good and godly ones they hold
that it’s a sin
To troll the jolly bowl around and let the dollars
spin ;
But I’m for toleration and for drinking at an inn,
Says the old bold mate of Henry Morgan.
Oh, some are sad and wretched folk that go in
silken suits,
And there’s a mort of wicked rogues that live in
good reputes ;
So I'm for drinking honestly and dying in my
boots,
Like an old bold mate of Henry Morgan.

What’s the Excitement?
Why, they are all hurrying to get their
bikes fitted up with the improved
EADIE COASTER HUB
as now manufactured by the famous B.S.A. Co.
We simply cannot deliver these fast enough, and you should not waste
a moment if you want one for the coming season. The Eadie Coaster
Hub is now the most perfect combination of free wheel and brake that
is possible to conceive, and can be fitted to any bicycle by any dealer.
The Eadie Two-speed Coaster
is on the same principle, but combines a free wheel and brake with a
perfect two-speed gear. This, of course, costs more money, but the
benefit secured to road riders is a revelation.
Get a B.S.A. Handbook (just out) and learn all about the latest
improvements in the world-famous B.S.A. production. It can be had
from any dealer, or from —

VERY SOOTHING AFTER SHAVING
AN OLD RESIDENT’S
TESTIMONY.
After Effects of Rheumatic Fever Cured.
“I have been living at No. 18 Arthur-street,
Balmain, for the past thirteen years,” said Mrs.
Jane Toovey, to our reporter, “and anybody in
that neighborhood could tell you what a wreck I
was three years after I settled there. It was
rheumatic fever that was the cause of it, and
when I tell you that for four months I was suffer-
ing from that dreadful complaint, you can form
an idea what a bad effect it had on my consti-
tution generally.”
“No doubt your internal organs were greatly
upset?”
“ Fearfully so ; my liver and kidneys being in a
very bad state, and I was so low and weak that I
could scarcely crawl about. But as well as being
so feeble, I nad pains of the most excruciating
character to put up with, particularly in my head,
which was never free from them. And there was
an intensity about those pains which was enough
to destroy one’s reason —an incessant ache, ache,
ache, that took so much out of me that I hadn’t
the power left to do even the lightest of work.
What made matters worse, too, was not being able
to sleep, for several nights in succession passed,
and I would find myself awake all the time. Need-
less to say, that this helped to wear me out more
and more, and the pitiful part of it all was that
the medicines I had taken, in the hope of acquir-
ing relief from my burden of suffering, were quite
ineffective. I could have left them alone, for all
the good they did me. Giddy turns came on fre-
quently, and it was quite a common thing for me
to be feeling all right one moment and the next to
be in a dead faint. A strange sensation would
steal itself over me, and I’d gradually find myself
losing self control, and I would know no more till
the faintness passed, and consciousness was re-
gained. Oh ! I used to dread these attacks, for I
felt sure I would one day pass away in that man-
ner. And talk about being nervous ! I was some-
thing terrible, any sounds causing me to start, and
I would tremble excessively. Besides this I
was excitable in the extreme, and so fret-
ful that the least thing would upset me for
hours. What worried me to no small extent was
the way my heart used to behave. It would start
beating so violently as to suggest the possibility
of jumping out of its place, and then die right
away, as if going to stop, to be followed by those
nasty fainting feelings that I dreaded so much.
And so my miserable life continued until I chanced
to get into touch with Clements Tonic, which I
can truthfully speak of as the best I have ever
taken in all my experience.”
“ More effective than the doctors ?”
“Infinitely, as nothing but Clements Tonic re-
leased me from the awful depression of spirits I
labored under, and the head pains that I had en-
dured so long. It was splendid, too, for making me
eat, which was something new, as my appetite had
been non-existent for months. I had also been
feeling severe pains across the small of rav back,
about my shoulders and chest, too; but with the
advent of Clements Tonic I gained ease rapidly,
and soon was free from all my old torments. And
when my nights became more peaceful, and the
heart troubles began to disappear, I was relieved
of a load of care that I was glad to get rid of.
But what caused most surprise was the way I
threw off my nervousness. It was marvellous,
for not long before, I was always shaking, and
timorous in mind, and would riot stay in the house
alone for all the tea in China, and after using
several bottles of Clements Tonic I was as right
as the bank. Not only had I gained in these
respects, but I was acquiring strength daily, and
soon felt as well as ever, with not an ailment left
unconquered.”
“ Well, if you have no objection to seeing your
experience in print, we will make use of them ?”
“ Nothing gives me greater pleasure than to tell
folks what a wonderful medicine Clements Tonic
is, so you are at liberty to publish all I’ve said, in
any form you think best. I know that Clements
Tonic cured me when I was very weak and ill,
and I know it can do the same for others, so do
what you like with my recommendation.”
STATUTORY DECLARATION.
I, JANE TOOVEY, of 18 Arthur Sti'ret,' Balmain,
in the State of New South Wales, Commonwealth of
Australia, do solemnly and sincerely declare that I have
carefully read the annexed document, and that it contains
and is a true and faithful account of my illness and cure
by Clements Tonic, and also contains my full permission
to publish in any way my statements—which I give
voluntarily, without receiving any payment; and I make
this solemn declaration conscientiously believing the same
to be true, and by virtue of the provisions of the Oaths
Act, 1900.

so hard he cannot sleep. That

SThe SCOTT’S Emuls ion post-
bag last year brought this letter among
many hundreds recording cures by
SCOTT S Emulsion, cures that oilier
preparations, all other emulsions, failed
to secure. The reason why SCOTT’S
Emulsion cures is not far to seek; it is
in the Emulsion itself—purest ingre-
dients, perfectly and palatably com-
bined by the unique SCOTT process.
Scott’s

Decay.
The roads the river crosses
Are long since overgrown
With hazel-scrub and mosses,
And all the place is lone,
With bark-roofed huts decaying
Beside the river shore ;
And sounds of children playing
Are heard thereby no more.
Among the buildings scanty
Of that forgotten town,
An old and battered shanty
Still wears the long years down ;
But now the grass is growing
Along the broken floors,
And seeds of Nature’s sowing
Blow through the gaping doors.
Not any sound of laughter,
Nor echo of old song
Soars to the blackened rafter
From some uproarious throng ;
The cobwebs at the portal,
The rust on bolt and ring,
Like memories immortal
About the ruin cling.
For gone the Hebes laden
With all the fare that cheers ;
Each buxom, bright-eyed maiden
Has passed a-down the years ;
And gone the landlord hearty,
That over-jocund host—
The life of every party—
Himself is now a ghost.
Here lights, and glasses clinking,
And many a rousing song
Trom men, elate with drinking,
Beguiled the evenings long ;
Escaping Ruin’s fingers,
That call to mgny a feast—
The creaking signboard—lingers,
“Good fare for man and beast.”
With good she-oak, which quenches
The thirsty drouths of Fate,
Here, on the rough bush benches,
Old bar-retainers sate
Recalling days of action,
Of strange and weird exploits,
Or watched, with satisfaction,
The ancient game of quoits.
But adverse winds have scattered
These craft to divers strands ;
Some badly wrecked and shattered,
Some blown to distant lands ;
Their ways no man may follow,
And in their place to-day
The ruin haunting swallow
Builds safe her nest of clay.

Broken Heart.
Broken Heart is all in tears,
Tears and misery,
And tisn t right that eyes so bright
Should I>e so sad to see ;
“Alas ! alas*!''’ says Broken Heart,
- “ Love’s been the death o’ me ! ”
At), Broken Heart, don’t worry so,
Cease sighing and be still,
Just whisper soft your grief aloft,
To the dweller upon the hill.
To the singer who sits-in the crystal tower,
That shakes with his passionate thrill.
The singer’s tower, it is set on high,
And prisons the ruby fires
Of sun and star, and from it afar
Go out long golden wires.
Bight down to the world of men below,
lo the shrines of their dear desires.
Down, down they go to the pleasure place,
And the silent cypress grove,
Where sorrow lies with stricken eyes,
And a starless space above ;
Dark sighings breathe there in the trees
And sobs of broken love.
Man’s mind a-fret and the poet-soul,
Though years divide or seas,
Speak each to each in subtle speech,
And the wires are sympathies ;
The mirth and tears of the ancient heart
Live on in our melodies.
So Broken Heart to a golden wire
Her red lips married, and said :
“ I would I could die, a-weary am I;
For my roses all are shed.”
And her-plaint went up to the singer’s tower,
And he listened with bended head.
She told him a something old as the hills,
And sad as the song of the sea
A rose overkind, blown astray by the wind,
Or a violet plucked may be.
“ -^ nd he never blew me a kiss,” she said,
“ And we parted, and woe is me.”
The singer answered : “O Broken Heart,
Made pale m an hour of bliss,
I’ve seen tears dew brown eyes’and blue
Since first maids learnt to kiss • • •
And many a time my trembling fyre
Has melted to themes like this.”
He touched the lyre, and it seemed to her ‘
A wound forgot its pain
And peace befell beneath the spell
Of that sweet wonder-strain •
For song robs Love of all her smart
And Death of half his gain.

How to Address Letters.
Correspondents to Tint Bulletin would oblige the paper
(and, to an extent, themselves) by taking some care as to
methods of address.
Business letters (with regard, to subscriptions, advertise-
ments, etc.) should in no case be addressed to the Editor,
but to the Manager. To send them to the Editor is to
invite inattention.
It is not a good, thing to address editorial letters to
anyone by name. “ The Editor, Bulletin,” is the proper
superscription for “copy." Belay, and even loss, is
sometimes caused by addressing to persons instead of
officials. The person may not be there ; the official
always is.
Special Notice.
Insufficiently stamped letters are liable to be refused.
The contents of this paper are copyright by the pub-
lishers. The, right to reproduce or translate any part of
the contents of this number is hereby expressly reserved by
the publishers.
The Editor will carefully read and, where practicable,
acknowledge in the “ Correspondence" column all contri-
butions subinitted, whether in the form of Political,
Social, or other Articles, Verse, Short Tales or Sketches
(thos? dealing with A ustralian subjects, and not exceeding
twe columns in length, or, say, 3000 words, are specially
acceptable), Paragraphs, Betters, or Neivspaper Clippings.
All communications will be regarded as strictly confi-
dential.
Tint Buli.ktin will return all unsuitable MS. when the
address is specified and stamps are enclosed. But no
MS. ivill be returned, or preserved, unless these conditions
are observed. When MS. is forwarded without stamps
for return it will be understood that the copy is to be
destroyed if not acceptable. Personal applications for
return of MS. cannot receive attention. Tint Bulletin
desires, farther, those sending MS. to distinctly under-
stand that it is not responsible for the preservation or
transmission of MS.

Anyone supplying to Tint Buli.ktin original humorous
or other topical drawings in line or wash, of sufficient
merit and interest and adapted for muter reproduction, or
any interesting photograph illustrative of a current event,
will be paid for same on acceptance. Any picture con-
taining a good idea, hut unfitted for direct reproduction
— i.e., any picture which has to be re-drawn —will be paid

It has often happened that he who takes the
line of least resistance gets hanged through the
wretched thing becoming tangled round his neck.
A greasy, treacherous hangman’s rope is that same
line of least resistance, and when it is cut up small
it makes the snakes which the drunk sees in his
dreams. The members of the Fused Government
are much addicted to the line above mentioned,
and nothing but disgrace has come of it. When
one or two foolish papers started an artificial
madness for the giving away of Dreadnoughts,
Deakin and Cook apparently thought the miser-
able thing would catch on ; so they rushed into
the front rank of the hysteria. Then it seemed
easier for a dead-tired Deakin to say he would
call on the State Governments to unlock their
lands 1 than to unlock them himself by a pro-
gressive land-tax, so Alfred the Affable took
the line of least resistance there also—only he is
too tired to call on the States as promised. He is
doing the same lazy, indifferent sort of process
over the abandonment of what he has declared over
and over again to be the best site for the Federal
capital. He has already backed down over the
matterof military education ; the worry of organ-
ising a system for the training of the adult male
population is to be got over by not training the
adult male population at all, but merely putting
school-kids through a few military exercises. He
is apparently going to do an affable sur-
render in the matter of the direct transcontinental
railway. His persistent slinking along the line of
least resistance in the matter of the Federal land-
tax and other direct taxation rendered a deficit
inevitable, and it was easier to propose a
ing policy than to make a serious effort to keep
honest and solvent. This was the same old line
again. But the country didn’t take kindly to the
idea of borrowing £1,200,000 to fill the gap which
incompetence and affability had made in the
revenue, so the Deakin Government rushed to
confer with the State Premiers, and again took
what seemed at the moment to be the line of
fewest obstacles. In return for a little —a very
little—present cash assistance to enable it the
better to face the electors next autumn, the Fused
Ministry wants to pledge the Commonwealth to
pay the State Treasurers in years to come sums
that are absolutely impossible. And just about
here the line of least resistance got round the
Fused Ministry’s neck, and that Ministry began
to be a scragged combination.
m * * *
The ar, ngement at which Prime Minister
Deakin ar, ved with the State Premiers is an e ven
more outrageous attempt to sell posterity into
bondage than the borrowing proposals which
preceded it. In return for an immediate
gift from the States of £600,000 to help the.
Fused crowd’s lame financial dog over the
stile it is proposed that the Federal Government
should pay the State Treasurers an annual sub-
sidy of 255. per inhabitant for ever , in addition to
relieving them of their old-age pension liabilities,
equal to about 9s. per inhabitant per annum—34s.
in all. Now, the present tariff revenue is a wildly
inflated thing, because of the artificial boom
created by land sales (which are temporary), gold
discoveries (which are strictly temporary), and
foreign loans (which are worse than temporary,
because they are a liability). The impossibility of
the proposed bargain can be guessed at when it is
remembered that Germany only manages to col-
lect about 205.. France 255., Britain 305., the
United States 265., and Canada about 40s. per
inhabitant annually in Customs and Excise. These
figures explain clearly what Australia must
come to when its early-day land and loan
and gold booms are over, and it settles
down to a plain ordinary existence; and in view
of these figures the proposal to subsidise the States
for ever to the extent of 255. per head—which
means that when Australia has 80,000,000 people,
like the United States, the subsidy will be
£100,000,000 a year—is a folly that is past belief.
Also the payment of £100,000,000 a year in the
future in return for £600,000 now is aggravated
usury, and should be brought before the law
courts on the plea that a foolish infant has been
taken in. This attempt to commit the Common-
wealth for all time to pay to the States, out of
the tariff revenue, a sum that is larger than the
whole tariff revenue is likely to amount to, is the
more absurd, seeing that after the end of next year
the tariff revenue is entirely at the disposal of the
Commonwealth —unless, of course, some such fool
bargain as this is made—and it has no need to pay
the State Treasurers anything whatsoever.
* * * *
In justice to the Fused Government, however,
it should be mentioned that there are other con-
siderations in the bargain. It receives a grant of
£600,000 as already mentioned. It also gets the
date of the abolition of the Braddon clause ad-
vanced six months, so that for the second half of
next year the Commonwealth will pay the State
Treasurers a trifle less than it would otherwise
have done. And the State Premiers, having got
satisfaction, withdraw their threat to run State
Rights candidates against the Fused Ministry arid
its supporters—a matter which, while rather bene-
ficial than otherwise to the country, would make
an end of the Fusion and its portfolio and all its
works. But even on these terms the price seems
high, and the whole business looks like an
attempt to sell the future Australian infant
into financial bondage for a song. Still the
infant has been sold so often that perhaps once
more doesn’t matter. The arrangement dodges
all mention of the transfer of the State debts to
the Commonwealth, and their consolidation and
gradual repayment. There is much brain-fag
attached to that question, and a Government
which believes in taking the line of least resist-
ance probably prefers to leave it also to the infant.
It is wonderful the number of things that are left
to the infant.
* * * *
This theory of a huge and ever-increasing sub-
sidy is a purely Australian folly. Among the
other Federations of the world such an idea, even
in a mild form, is practically unknown. In Ger-
many not only does the central authority retain
for its own use all the Customs and Excise revenues,
but it levies contributions on the States—an
arrangement which would drive Wade frantic
and make Kidston too excited for words. The
Swiss Federation pays no subsidy to the States,
and it bursts up Australian tradition in two other
ways: (1) By making the railways Federal pro-
perty ; (2) by paying off its debt so rapidly that
the amount set apart for the repayment of
debt is more than that set apart for interest.
The United States, Argentina, Brazil, Mexico
—in fact, all the multitude of the Fede-
ral republics—are free from the State subsidy
craze. Canada still has it to the extent that the
central authority pays the Provincial Govern-
ments about £1,300,000 a year, but that is very
different from the Fused Ministry’s proposal to
pay about £5,500,000 a year and to keep on
enlarging the amount annually for ever and ever.
When the choice lies between lifting the large
end of the burden now and leaving the small end
to posterity, or lifting the top twig now and leav-
ing the trunk and roots for the infant to carry,
The Bulletin believes always in humping the big-
gest end of the load to-day. There were many
objections to the terms which William Lyne
offered to the State Treasurers, mainly on account
of their excessive liberality, but Lyne’s plan had
at least these three notable advantages: (1) It
provided for the taking over by the Common-
wealth of the State debts ; (2) it provided for the
complete severance within a comparatively brief
period, of Federal and State finance ; (3) it pro-
vided that all the heavy financial lifting which
had to be done should be done within the lifetime
of this generation, and made a notable reduction
in the habit of leaving things to posterity. No
financial arrangement with the States should be
even considered unless it includes the absolute
transfer of all the existing State debts to the
Commonwealth, and there should also be a
cast-iron assurance that the Commonwealth
will set about the repayment of the debt
at once, and won’t let up on the job
till it is finished. There is no reason why this
should not be done. The gradual repayment of
Australia’s debt doesn’t really require any extra
money; all that is needed is a Government with
energy, intelligence, a desire to Do Things and a
capacity for getting out of the rut—a Government
which isn’t too affable, and which doesn’t truckle
to the stodgy, conservative, precedent-ridden
daily papers. The adoption of the Canadian bank-
ing system, whereby the banks are required to hold
at least 40 per cent, of their cash reserves in Federal
paper money, would give the Commonwealth con-
trol of at least £10,000,000 for which no interest
whatever would be payable, arid if £2,000,000 of
this were retained in gold as a reserve against the
Federal note issue there would remain. £8,000,000
to serve as the foundation of a sinking fund with
which to clear away the great debt incubus. As
population increased and banking business grew
a lot more millions would probably drop into the
sinking fund through the operation of the 40 per
cent, clause, and this money, accumulating steadily
at compound interest, would be eating up the
public debt all the while—day and night, Sundays,
week days, public holidays and all other days—
without costing the country a single penny.
•* * * *
But this sort of work can only be undertaken if
the power which controls banking legislation—
the Commonwealth —also has charge of the
debts. And the Deakin-Cook crowd apparently
doesn’t want to take over the debts. It is
tired and lazy. It has to placate the State
Premiers, seeing that it is holding out the hat of
mendicancy to them, and the State Premiers
as a rule don’t want to part with even
their liabilities lest their personal import-
ance should be diminished. Then, too, any
unusual method of reducing and ultimately paying
off the public debt would assuredly bring down
the disapprobation of the Tory daily press, which
strongly objects to things that are “ unprece-
dented,” and the Fusion can’t afford toantagonise
the daily press. In every possible respect it is
struggling to find the line of least resistance, and
making an awful mess of the search. Under the
Deakin-Cook plan—if Australia should be mad
enough to accept it and stick to it—the proba-
bilities are that 100 years hence the Common-
wealth’s liabilities to the States will have climbed
up to the alarming figure of about £50,000,000 a
year, and the present debt, with its interest
charge of nearly £9,000,000 a year, will be as good
as new. Under the plan which The Bulletin
advocates the Commonwealth would pay nothing
to the States, but merely take over their debts, and
within the time of people now living—that is to
say, before the new baby of to-day becomes a
centenarian—the whole present liability of about
£250,000,000 could be paid off without the opera-
tion costing the country a penny. After that was
done nearly £9,000,000 a year of interest would be
saved, and that £9,000,000 a year, added to the
saving of the £50,000,000 a year to which Deakin’s
insane State subsidy would have probably grown
by then, would make a difference of £59,000,000 a
year in the Commonwealth’s liabilities. Yet if
the Lyne scheme were adopted, with the above
proposed device for the re-payment of the debt
tacked on to it, the State Governments would be
actually a little better off in the immediate present
than under the Deakin proposal. On the other
hand, the Deakin Government would be a little
worse off in the immediate present—and that is
just where the fatality comes in. The scheme
which would clear off £250,000,000 of debt gratis
inside a century, and save £9,000,000 a year for
ever afterwards, and save a probable demand a
century hence for £50,000,000 a year of State sub-
sidy, has this serious drawback —that it doesn’t
show how the calamitous Fuse is to get over the
next eight or nine months without raising new
revenue. And a Fuse which is made up of so
many curious elements that it contains people who
object to practically everything is afraid to run
after new revenue lest it should fall to pieces on
the road.
THE FLEET THAT IS TO BE.
The British House of Commons has been officially
informed of the results of the Defence Conference,
and as they fill two columns of cablegram the
information should be fairly complete. As regards
land defence but little is said. There seems to be
no agreement as to the size of the various forces;
but there is a statement to the effect that, “the
formation of units, the arrangements for trans-
port, the pattern of weapons, etc.,” are to be “as
far as possible assimilated with those recently
worked out for the British army.” This informa-
tion is more or less cheering—probably less. It
suggests a much more conspicuous desire to qualify
the troops of Greater Britain for toiling alongside
the J. Bull soldiery in J. Bull’s foreign
wars than to qualify them for local de-
fence. The kind of force, for example, which is
calculated to put up the best possible scrap on be-
half of a continent carrying less than two persons
to the square mile may be hardly the same kind
as the one which has been trained according to the
traditions of old wars fought in Belgium and
India, and other thickly-peopled places. To con-
sider only one aspect of the case, the transport
arrangements which are good enough for a cam-
paign among the kitchen gardens of Flanders
might look very poor arrangements if the scrap
was going to be fought amid the illimitable dis-
tances outside Port Darwin or Broome. And how
a citizen army like the one which Australia must
have if its few million people are to put up even a
fair show of defence over a whole continent can be
“ standardised,” to use the cablegrammic expres-
sion, with Britain’s small force of narrow-chested
permanent hirelings is a dark saying and not easy
to understand.
* * * *
The naval proposals are a curious lot. It is
suggested that there should be three new squad-
rons in the Pacific waters —the Australian, the
East Indian and the Chinese. They are to be of
the same size, consisting each of one cruiser
battleship, three small cruisers, six torpedo
destroyers of the “River” class, and three sub-
marines. The Australian squadron is to be the
Commonwealth’s special responsibility, and the
arrangement suggests that in the view of the
Conference Australia ranks exactly level in im-
portance with Hong Kong and the other scrappy
possessions in the Chinese Seas. A squadron of 13
vessels, of which not one is quite first-class,
is a very humble apology for naval defence
for an insular country of this size. It is
also a very humble apology for the naval defence of
a country of this population. Britain supports
about 500 fighting ships, and the Commonwealth,
with one-tenth of Britain’s population, should do
better than 13 vessels, mostly of the midget class.
The squadron seems designed, in fact, not so
much to ensure the safety of the Commonwealth
as to save the face of the Deakin Ministry, which
has talked largely and loosely about defence, and
at the same time, in its struggles to placate Tories,
big landlords and State Premiers with large sub-
sidies and large exemptions from taxation, has
reduced its finances to such a low ebb that it can’t
seriously defend anything. By way of further letting
the Fused Government down easily it is to be pro-
fessed that the cruiser which will be the leading
ship of the Australian squadron here is really the
battleship which Deakin offered as part of the
British fleet to help defend the Ma Country some
12,000 miles away. Thus it is professed that the
Dreadnought was accepted with thanks instead
of refused with great firmness. There has been
nothing quite like that in the way of letting one-
self down gently since the day of the agile French
country editor who saved his face by explaining
that the paragraph about a housemaid having
committed suicide by hanging at Marseilles was
really correct in the main, the only discrepancies
being that it was an infantry soldier who had been
run over by a vehicle at Rheims and not seriously
injured.
* * * •
The methods by which it is proposed to finance
the inefficient little Australian squadron are un-
usual, not to say amazing. In the first place,
Australia is to maintain the squadron “with some
temporary assistance from the Imperial funds.”
That is to say, the Fused Ministry has professed
to shove £2,000,000 worth of battleship upon
Britain as a free gift in addition to providing for
its own naval defence : yet when the matter really
comes to an issue, it is found cadging alms from
its aged parent, and this despite the fact that it
has been relieved of the liability which it pro-
fessed to be so anxious to assume—the £2,000,000
liability for a battleship for service in British
waters. And as for the other part of the bill for
the very small squadron—the part that isn’t alms
and cadge—it seems that it is to be loan. This at
least is how the cablegram puts the case :
Great Britain contributes £'250,000 annually to the
squadron of the Common wealth.
It is expected that the Commonwealth will raise a
naval loan, requiring £500,000 annually in interest and
sinking fund.
If Maoriland floats a loan she will require to pay
£150,000 annually for interest and sinking fund, besides
the contribution of £lOO,OOO a year as heretofore.
Partly begged from Ma and partly borrowed from
Ma, and not much of a squadron after all —that
is the record. And when the craving to give
£2,000,000 to the mother country wilts, upon
closer inspection, down to a craving to cadge
£250,000 a year from the mother country, it is a
very poor business.
*’• • *
Maoriland, as usual, goes its own foolish road.
It is going to pay for one big cruiser, apparently
with borrowed money, and to pay £lOO,OOO a year
towards the upkeep of some smaller vessels. If it
made its arrangements with the Commonwealth,
the joint squadron, with two big cruisers and a
fair-sized tail of smaller vessels, would make some
show of being respectable. But Maoriland is too
“loyal” to have any truck with a mere “colonial”
fleet, so it throws in its lot with the British
squadron at Hong Kong. Maoriland’s cruiser is
to be stationed in the far-off Chow seas, and the
Dominion is to be visited by small vessels from
there. It is a silly arrangement, for the Chow
squadron is to be no larger than the Common-
wealth one, and it will be a vast deal more remote
and less likely to get to the spot in time when it
is wanted. Also it is a great deal more likely not
to even try to reach the spot, but to hasten off to
defend India or the Suez Canal or some such
place. But it will be a purely British squad-
ron, from the country where Joseph Ward got his
title, and that fact counts for much.
* * * *
The last folly of all is the proposal to make
Sydney the naval headquarters. No nation which
knows anything of naval matters makes its
greatest commercial port its naval port also. The
naval port should be a place apart, where land is
cheap for docks, foundries and shore defences,
where there is room for manoeuvres without sink-
ing 150 ferry-boats, where big guns can be tested
without breaking 250 windows and scaring 350
cab-horses. But the Congested Population policy
demands that everything must be dragged to
Sydney if it isn’t dragged to Melbourne, so this
move was probably inevitable.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
It Might Never Occur Again.
A vert depressed wail was the wail of Hughes,
M.H.R., when he implored the Deakin-Cook
Government to hustle, to bog in, to arouse itself,
and to get the capital of all Australia fixed and
nailed down, because “the circumstances which
made for the selection of Yass-Canberra might
never occur again, and the present Parliament
would have no controlover the Parliament which
followed it.” No man ever spoke more solid
truth than did Hughes, M.H.R., when he made
these remarks. There were quite a lot of circum-
stances not likely to occur again which helped to
snatch a vote for the fixing of the Australian
capital at Yass-Canberra. There was, to begin
with, Hughes’ yearning to oblige his con-
stituents, the water-side workers of Sydney, who
hadn’t then quite dropped to the fact that
the establishment of a rival Federal port,
just 87 miles,from Sydney, might be more loss than
profit to a Sydney water-side worker. There
was the theory that the Federal Labor party
should support Yass-Canberra because it lies
in a Labor man’s electorate, and the selection
of a capital there would help to secure that Labor
man’s 1 e-election —which is sheer foolishness, for
when about 1000 square miles have been cut out
to make a Federal territory it is probable that the
remainder of the electorate will be distributed
among the adjacent constituencies, and the local
Labor man will have to look for a new seat.
Again, when the selection was made, the
people hadn’t quite dropped to the fact that
the proposed Federal port at Jervis Bay is only 87
miles from Sydney, and as the Constitution says
the seat of Government must be at least
100 miles from Sydney, the Federal port,
which seems to be part of the seat, will
be held on a shaky and very insecure
tenure. Again, when Yass-Canberra was selected
the public was still obsessed or hypnotised by
the wild cries of the Sydney press about the
alleged utter uninhabitableness of the rival site at
Dalgety and of the Monaro tableland! generally.
It had no idea in, those days that, as soon as
Monaro seemed to be knocked out as a Federal
capital site, the N.S.W. State Government would
hurry on the.,building of a railway through the
tableland on the ground that it was a place of
amazing fertility which ought to be opened up;
nor did it imagine that the N.S.W. Tourist
Department would begin to boost it up as the
great holiday resort of the State, and that Percy
Hunter would lecture about its glories and de-
clare it a Paradise. Furthermore, when Yass-
Canberra got the vote, the special commission
appointed by the Federal Government hadn’t
announced that the available water could only
be relied upon to supply, at great cost, a city of
50,000 people, and the community hadn’t yet heard
of Prime Minister Deakin’s proposal for bringing
water-power, at heavy expense, nearly 90 miles
from the rejected Dalgety site to the allegedly
superior Yass-Canberra site in order to prevent the
allegedly superior Yass-Canberra site being an
utter failure. Also the selection of Yass-Canberra
was made before the N.S.W. Public Works Com-
mittee had refused to recommend the extension
of the South Coast railway to Yass-Canberra’s
proposed port at Jervis Bay, on the ground that
the locality was so barren as to make the idea ridi-
culous. In those days, too, the N.S.W. Railway
Department hadn’t made its attempt to run holi-
day excursions to Yass-Canberra, and given them
up in disgust because no one wanted to go to the
very ordinary place. People had hardly realised
either that the proposed site was almost alongside
Lake George, the chief feature of which nowa-
days is that cattle are grazing in the bed of the
alleged lake. They hadn’t dropped to the fact
that the Cotter “river,” which is to supply the
Yass-Canberra capital with drinkables, is so


humble a stream that Government Statistician
Knibbs leaves it out of his immense list
of Australian rivers, creeks and streams, as
if it were a thing of no account. And
they hadn’t noticed quite so vigorously as
they may have done since that the alleged indig-
nation of the N.S.W. people at the proposal to fix
the Australian capital on Monaro wasn’t strong
enough to run to even one public meeting of 100
people. When Yass-Canberra was selected, the
community didn’t really understand that the
huge popular demand for the place could be found
nowhere except in the columns of the Sydney
morning papers, and that the Sydney morning
papers had an interest in the matter, inasmuch
as a capital which is so near Sydney that the
Herald and Telegraph can be delivered there
by breakfast time is also a capital where these
papers can annex the business and the profits.
It hadn’t absorbed the fact that it had a chance
such as had never occurred before in the world’s
written history—the chance to select the capital
of a whole continent, and to make it worthy of its
distinction as the only city on earth which has
ever been the capital of a whole continent —and
that it was fooling the opportunity away to pro-
vide a little more money for one or two enor-
mously rich Tory papers and to gratify the preju-
dices of a few narrow, parish-minded politicians.
Hughes, M.H.R., spoke a great truth when he
said that “the circumstances which made for the
selection of Yass-Canberra might never occur
again.”
Stinking Fish in the Australian Parliament.
A dreary instance of the Freetraders hankering
to belittle his country’s industries at any price,
and absolutely regardless of the facts of the case,
was Bruce Smith’s recent outburst in the House
of Reps, in re the mishap to the Powerful’s
crank shaft. Moved by no other force, seem-
ingly, than annoyance at the industrial pro-
gress N.S.'W. has made since it jettisoned
the foolish old policy that is ruining the country
where it was born, Smith rose up and jeered
heavily at the Socialistic Fitzroy Hock, which is
the pride and glory of the Ma State’s
allegedly Anti-Sosh Government. The dock,
according to Smith, is a rather useless
concern, and its Rngineer-Superintendent a
futile braggart in whom veracity is not.
He asserted scornfully that Cutler, who runs the
dock, had boasted that he could ‘’build a
Dreadnought there.” “Yet what occurs,”
demanded Smith, “ when the dock is given the
opportunity to replace the Powerful’s disabled
crank shaft ? It has to admit its incompetence
in the matter. It is forced to decline the
paltry job. The order for the shaft goes
to Lngland.” As a matter of plain un-
varnished truth, neither Cutler nor any other
sane, knowledgable human being ever asserted
that a Dreadnought could be built at Fitz-
roy or any other existing Australian dock.
Owing in great part to the dogged fight
put up by Bruce Smith and his friends
in the cause of hired defence, the day has
not yet dawned when a Commonwealth
ship-building yard will be capable of undertaking
the construction of a Commonwealth Dread-
nought. But, despite the efforts of the anti-
National, anti-Sosh and anti-Defence crowd in
this part of the world, a dock has come into being
that is fully capable of building destroyers and
other large vessels for coastal defence purposes—
which is satisfactory enough to go on with. The
Dock never had the chance to refuse the job of
making a crank shaft for the Powerful. The
order did not come its way. Few docks and few
ship-building firms even in the Cold Land, whose
steel and iron foundries used to lead the world,
are capable nowadays of undertaking such an
order. It is a lamentable fact that, owing to the
Freetrade insanity which still afflicts the Bruce
Smith type of politician, such important and
highly-specialised jobs as heavy forgings go
mostly to Germany. Krupps has in the last six
years been responsible for many of the parts of
British battleships. Smith’s wild anxiety to
advertise the alleged incompetence of N.S.W.’s
big shipbuilding institution is unpleasantly signi-
ficant of the lengths to which the incurable Foreign-
trader is prepared to go in his efforts to boost up his
burst cause. Fven the N.S. W. State-ffighter’s usual
custom of lauding the Ma State’s assets to the roof
goes by the board before the more urgent Free-
trade requirement of proving Australians futile
and boastful personages and their industries tin-
pot affairs. Bruce Smith hasn’t apologised for
his slander on Engineer-Superintendent Cutler,
or for his uncalled-for gibe at hisown State’s ship-
building institution. He has kept a murky
silence on the subject so far, perhaps on the good old
principle that silence, however discreditable, is
safest in certain hopeless circumstances.
The Alarm of J. Bull Cohen.
The Bulletin receives this note from Taree
(N.S. W.): —
Following is an extract from a letter sent bvfi. A.
Price, M.L.A., to the Mayor of Taree (N.S. W.)'
“ It is impossible for the Crown to find the loan money for
one-half the works granted, and I am afraid that several
may have to stand over. Even the Oarcoar railway is to
be hung up, and other works. The fact is that the' Eng-
lish investor is frightened at the trend of legislation, and
no loan money can be obtained in London or Paris for
Australia just at present. The British investor is afraid
as to the result of the next Federal elections, and English
capital is being gradually withdrawn from investment in
Australia. Financial advices from London are very
alarming, as instructions have been issued to withdraw
money invested when the mortgages fall in. This means
bad times and stagnation ; but confidence in our securities
has been shaken, and the foreign and British moneylender
is not desirous of investing money in Australia, in view of
the possibility of extreme laws being passed.”
Is the foregoing true, or is it an electioneering dodge,
and are all the other members of the Liberal and Deform
party sending similar letters to the various mayors in
their constituencies, with the object of alarming the
people, and inflaming their minds against the Labor
party ?
Upon which The Bulletin makes these few
remarks to go on with :
(1) If the British investor believes that the Australian
Labor party intends to smash things, that isn’t the Labor
party’s fault. It is the fault of the unpatriotic perjurers
who persist in spreading infamous lies concerning the
party. The late Tom Price, the Labor leader, was
Premier of S. Aus. for three years, and they were years of
such prosperity and progress that throughout the State
he is now mourned as the best Premier the country ever
had.
(2) The British investor probably is alarmed. In N. S.
Wales, for instance, Carruthers and Wade fought an
election on this platform—that N. S. Wales had already
borrowed too heavily, and that Waddell was a most
dangerous financier, who shouldn’t be trusted a day
longer at the Treasury. Then, having got into office,
the Carruthers-Wade crowd presently, in order to keep
in office, took the alleged dangerous person into the
Ministry, made him Treasurer, and adopted his borrowing
policy. If a bank’s directors threw out the general
manager on the ground that he was a reckless plunger,
and got the : shareholders to endorse that action, and sub-
sequently restored him to his job, the depositors naturally
would he alarmed. And that is exactly what the Liberal
and Deform Government did; wherefore, if the British
investor isn’t alarmed it can only be because he believes
that the Carruthers-Wade and Liberal-Deform crowd is
an unmitigated liar.
(3) The Fused Government’s recent proposal to borrow
money in order to pay old-age pensions has also probably
alarmed J. Bull Cohen. If it didn’t, J. Bull Cohen is a
person who takes a.lot of alarming. If the depositors in
a bank found out that the directors intended to use the
deposits to pay pensions to themselves and other officers
and persons, there would not only be no more deposits for
that bank ; there would be a rush to take out what
deposits were already there.
(4) Having his money invested in Australia, J. Bull
Cohen naturally wants Australia defended ; and when
the Labor party was thrown out of office because (among
other things) it proposed to defend Australia, instead of
being only concerned about the defence of the North Sea,
J. Bull Cohen probably got further alarmed. If the
Bank of N. S. Wales did the same thing, and decided that
anything it had to spare on bolts and bars, and strong-
rooms and watchmen should be passed on to the Bank of
England, the Bank of N. S. Wales’ depositors would
begin to feel worried. And if General-Manager Russell
French was thrown out of his job for daring to propose
that his own bank deserved a strong-room and a window-
fastening or two, the depositors would probably feel
more alarmed than ever.
The Bulletin doesn’t know for certain whether
John Bull Cohen is alarmed, and, if so, how
much alarmed he is; hut it comes to the con-
clusion that if between them the Liberal and
Deform and the Fusion crowds, including R. A.
Frick, M.L.A., haven’t positively filled him with
terror during the last few years, he is either a
statue or a mummy.

The Sydney “Telegraph” on a Question of
Good Faith.,
The Sydney Telegraph (August 26) in an article
headed “The Federal Capital,” was completely
broken up at the possible wickedness of the human
race as embodied in the suggestion that the Yass-
berra capital may not eventuate after all. This
was the shocked—not to say heart-broken and
broken-up—attitude of the King-street paper :
It will he remembered that Mr. Wade stated in his
communication that New South Wales might be placed in
a false position if he passed an Act surrendering territory
to the Commonwealth before the latter had “deter-
mined ” the seat of government. As a matter of fact the
Federal Act, dealing with the capital, did “determine”
that the seat of government shall be in the district
of Yass-Canberra; and there is more than verbal
accuracy to be considered in the measure by
which the Commonwealth thus agreed upon the Yass-
Canberra selection. BEHIND THAT MEASURE STANDS
THE GOOD FAITH OF THE COMMONWEALTH, AND
IT IS UNTHINKABLE THAT THE PARLIAMENT OF
A CIVILISED PEOPLE WOULD TAKE REFUGE IN A
JUGGLE WITH WORDS in order to defraud this State
of its land, or of its right to have the capital in the terri-
tory specially surrendered for that purpose. If Mr. Wade
discerned a dangerous inconclusiveness in the proceed-
ings between Commonwealth and State, he was, of
? rse ’ Justified in having the position made clear,
amnougn, under other circumstances, it might well have
Deen dangerous to introduce a provocation to delay in a
matter which has already been delayed far too long, from
the point of view of New South Wales. The postpone-
ment of that provision in the Constitution, which gives
the seat of government to this State, was the product of
many factors ; but the dignified assertion of its right by
fuVr oUth ' Va * es > and the ultimate sense of justice in
the Commonwealth Parliament, combined to bring the
matter to a. stage close to finality ; that is, until further
rederal action becomes dependent upon the surrender of
the desired territory by this State.
It is, of course, a very lofty moral attitude. Still
it is worth remembering that not so very long ago
ij 6 ? fftith of the Commonwealth ” was
pledged to the Dalgety capital site, and the
lelegraph never rested norceased from troubling
until that good faith was repudiated, and the site
was shifted nearer to its office. Again, some
years ago, the honor and good faith of New South
Wales were pledged to an agreement whereby the
P ederal Constitution was to he accepted in that
State if it received a majority of votes, and if the
affirmative vote was at least 50,000 strong. The
original Constitution left the site of the Federal
capital an open question, and didn’t fix it in
N.S. W. The people of N.S. W. accepted that
Constitution, hut the most disgraceful herd of
political spielers that ever dishonored an
Australian Legislature nullified their accept-
ance by breaking faith with the other States
and raising the minimum affirmative vote
from 50,000 to 80,000. Then the Reid Ministry,
which the Telegraph warmly supported, de-
manded the possession of the capital as a bribe,
without which it would burst up the movement
that it had started, and in which the other States
had joined at its request and relying on its good
faith. The Telegraph had no protest to make in
those days. Its present mockery of dignified
reproach about “ the postponement of that pro-
vision in the Constitution which gives the seat of
Government to this State” is mere hypocrisv ;
the seat of Government has been fixed in N.S. W.
for about five years past, and the delay was
caused, not by any objection on the part of the
Federal authority to fix the capital in N.S.W.,
but owing to the clamor of certain people in
Sydney to have the capital fixed, not only in
N.S. W., hut close up to Sydney and within the
Telegraph’s business radius. Looking back on
all these events, the high moral attitude about
“the good faith of the Commonwealth” being
pledged to Yassberra loses some of its force. The
Telegraph’s friends have perpetrated so much
dirty, greedy, disreputable trickery without
arousing it to any severe reproach that there is
a strong tendency to look elsewhere for an
authority on the subject of good faith.
«
An Unpaid Bill.
A bill which the Federal Government ought to
pay without any further demur is that presented
by the Agricultural Implement Makers’Employees’
Union. The circumstances are these : When the
famous .New Protection was devised, it was pro-
vided that the manufacturers of agricultural imple-
ments should be protected by certain Customs
duties, the import duty on a harvester being £l2.
It was also provided that they should show to the
satisfaction of the Arbitration Court that they
paid fair—that is, the ordinary union—rate of
wages to their employees, and get a certificate to
that effect; failing which they became liable to
certain Excise duties—equal to £6 on a harvester.
The Customs duties came into force to the benefit
of the bucolic implement makers, but they
were not required to pay the Excise duties,
and they were not compelled to get a
certificate showing that fair wages were paid. At
last, as the Deakin Government wouldn’t move
to collect its own Excise or to enforce its own law,
the union tackled the question at its own risk.
In the course of the legal proceedings which fol-
lowed, it was proved that the M'Kays, the great
harvester people, and others, were not paying
“ fair and reasonable wages,” therefore the Excise
money was due to the Government, which was too
tired to collect it. The Government, having had
its right to a great heap of money proved, not by
its own efforts, for it was too lazy to make any
efforts, but hv the exertions of the workmen,
rushed in gradually, after much remonstrance
from outside, to demand payment. It was biffed
out on the ground that its New Protection
law was illegal, unconstitutional and a crude
idiot of a measure generally; and the
workers, having sued under an Act which
wouldn’t. hold water, were ordered to pay
their own Costs and those of the employers also.
Now the workers weren’t responsible for the fact
that the Deakin Government had sold them a gold
brick, a bottomless pit, a footless stocking without
a leg, a toothless dog that couldn’t bite, a blank
cartridge, a blind horse, and a bow with a broken
string. Alfred Deakin, as a lawyer, was sup-
posed to have built a law which could bear inspec-
tion. The workers proved that, if that law could
bear inspection, either they were entitled to cer-
tain wages, or the tired Government was entitled
to certain Excise money. The only reason why
they didn't get any satisfaction, but merely got a
vast bill for Costs, was that Alfred Deakin’s
Act could not bear inspection. Under the cir-
cumstances, it seems that either Deakin should
pay the Costs, or the Deakin Government should
pay them, or the Government should get rid of
Deakin.
The Blessings of Labor Government.
A few weeks ago S. Australia lost its first Labor
Premier. He had been in office since July; 1905 ;
and thus he had given Australia its first real taste
of the fruits of Labor Government. Nobody who
really knows anything about the Labor party in
Australia believes, of course, that it has any de-
signs on the marriage tie or the “sanctity of the
’ome” ; yet on every possible occasion sinister
suggestions to that effect are trotted out—mostly
for the benefit of the women voters who, not
having been in the business long, don’t know when
one of their lower limbs is being extended. Price’s
long Premiership is the one real test, then,
that Australia has had : here was a Labor
Premier with the power to raise Cain and
break things, and between three and four years to
do it in ; and if he didn’t raise Cain and break
things it is surely about up to the marriage-tie
perjurers to drop their calumny. Consequently,
the just-issued report of the S. Australian Regis-
trar-General is a handy thing to keep on the
shelf to heave at the lie whenever it shows
its head. For many years the S. Australian
marriage rate was distressingly low. In 1897 it
was down to 566 per 100,000 of the population,
and between 1885 and 1905 it only twice reached
700 per 100,000. Under a Labor Premier—with
“free love” and all the rest of it—things ought to
have promptly got worse. Instead, this was the
course of events :
1904 .. .. .. 691 per 100,000
1905 .. ... .. 700 „
1906 712
1907 799 „
1908 789 „
It is in the city and suburbs that the Labor party
is strongest; here the Labor views, given a free
fling, ought to have had the most distressing
results. Yet, as a matter of fact, this is what
happened in relation to marriages :
1904 766 per 100,000
1905 779 ~
1906 823 ~ „
1907 951 „
1908 1004 ~
And while the parson and the registrar were thus
busy, the Divorce Judge had next to nothing to do.
IS. Aus. has had only 20 divorces in three years,
while in the Ma State, blessed with a Deform
Government which protects the sanctity of the
’ome. it is a drj' year when the crop of divorces
doesn’t exceed 200. Further, there is the test of
the little Australian who doesn’t crawl into the
world through a wedding-ring. For the whole
Commonwealth in the last 10 years 610 of every
10,000 births have been of this sort. And this
is how S. Australia stood by comparison :
Commonwealth. N.S. Wales. S. Aus.
1905 624 737 437
1906 623 704 400
1907 615 704 410
1908 616 689 433
Even more remarkable is the progress made in
connection with the preservation of infant life.
During 1808 in Adelaide and suburbs 168 children
died out of every 1000 who were born —died inside a
year of their birth. In 1908 the loss was only 73
per 1000—less than half as many. So, instead of the
marriage tie being busted and the whole domestic
arrangements going to ruin under Labor rule,
the marriage tie has been fastened with more
frequency than it had been for very many
years; and, once having been fastened, it
has been loosened very rarely. Moreover the
rate of illegitimacy has been far below the aver-
age, and the regard for infant life has been far
above the average. In fact, none of the things
that ought to have happened have happened, and
the things that should have happened haven’t
happened. Australia has had one fair chance to
test the truth of about the most insidious and per-
sistent yarn told concerning the Labor party by
its enemies, and in the cold light of unimpeach-
able results the yarn stands fully exposed as a
poisonous lie.

The Latest Demoralisation of Justice.
Thus “ Gentleman One ” :
In Melbourne last week, the learned, honorable and
painfully sensitive profession of the law was thrown into
a state of agitation by what the newspapers called a
“ remarkable development ” in the political libel case of
Swinburne v. the Age. Defendant’s two counsel came
into Court one morning with the news that one of the
jurymen had met defendant’s solicitor’s clerk in the
street, and had spoken to him about the case, and about
the learned Judge’s behavior to one of the counsel afore-
said. Which non-extraordinary incident had, it seemed,
reduced the two counsel aforesaid to the necessity of
asking the plaintiff’s counsel to apply for the immediate
discharge of the jury, so that the case might be heard
over again by a fresh lot of good men and true.
To this expensive proposal plaintiff’s counsel would not
agree. This refusal to shriek for a disbandment of the
jury placed his learned friends on the other side in a
terrible predicament, they said. In their concern for the
purity of the administration of justice they almost shed
tears whilst beseeching the learned Judge to advise them
what to do. The Judge naturally demanded fuller particu-
lars of the tragedy, whereupon defendant’s solicitor’s
clerk did his tale unfold. It was a bold narrative, con-
tradicted in part by the other fellow'. The juryman who
met him in the street had not told him which way he
was going to vote, but he had dimly suggested, seemingly,
that his sympathies were with the defendant. Which
fact —or seeming fact—the lawyer’s clerk had communi-
cated to the defendant’s barristers. Thence their desire for
a new' trial. They felt that they couldn’t go on talking to
a jury one of whose members had professed himself
friendly to their cause. The secret confided to them by
the clerk had not been breathed to his employers, Messrs.
Sam Gillott and Mont. Their agony of mind W'as not
shared by poor Gillott until he came into court and
heard the story. They had merely given the particulars
to Duffy, K.C., the plaintiff’s leading counsel, with a
request that he would stop the case. The learned Judge,
having heard all these things, sided with Duffy, K.C., in
the opinion that the case could very well go On with a
reduced jury. His Honor proposed that six jurymen,
including the One who talked to the law yer’s clerk, should
be paid off, leaving the other six to find a verdict if they
could. But to this the two agitated counsel demurred.
The responsibility of continuing the case was more than
they could hear, so they gathered up their briefs and
retired. Presumably they went forth and attended to
another job in another court.
The publiccomment on this display of legal professional
squeamishness is “ Rats ! ’’—simply “ Rats ! ” There have
been cases in Melbourne during the hearing of which the
foreman of the jury went to lunch with one or other of
the counsel engaged. The Bulletin once mentioned the
indiscretion of the late George Bruce, as foreman of a
jury, in taking one of the counsel to feed with him. If
barristers were always so mightily solicitous for the fair
fame of Justice as these two counsel for the Age profess
themselves, the blinded goddess would not so often or so
openly shift her bandage and wink the other eye. In this
particular case, the agitated pair of counsel were practi-
cally branded as false alarmists by their learned brother on
the other side and the learned Judge on the bench. If they
took the right view of w'hat was necessary “in the interests
of Justice,” the other legal gentlemen took a wrong view,
and vice versa. Their view, to be sure, was indubitably
right in the interests of Costs ; and Justice is so closely
identified with Costs that possibly their interests are
mutual.
Nevertheless, the question remains vexed, and whilst
the professional guardians of justice are divided in their
opinion of what is best for her, the young woman is losing-
her last vestige of public respect. She has pulled off her
bandage, and is winking both eyes indiscriminately, as
though inviting the public to step forw-ard and "offer
her protection. Justice is g-etting tired of living' with
the legal fraternity in Court. She has heard barristers
McArthur and Stark raving of their consciences, and has
heard Duffy, K.C., accuse those gentlemen of an en-
deavor to bluff the jury “ with a flimsy affectation of
sham propriety.” Moreover, she has heard Judge
Hodges say that he does not want to “directly or in-
directly influence any tribunal that may have to deal
with the difference between the statement made by the
juror and that made by the witness.” Echo asks: What
tribunal can possibly deal with the contradictory state-
ments of a juryman and a lawyer’s clerk concerning a
conversation which had no auditors save themselves?
One man’s unsupported word is as bad as another’s before
any tribunal. Again the public says “ Rats 1"

Concerning 24 Abandoned Homes.
When Victoria first set out on the track of the
State-provided water-channel, Alfred Deakin,
now Prime Minister, was one of the sponsors of
the new idea. As a result chiefly of his efforts,
the big Rodney and other Northern schemes were
carried out. The other day Elwood Mead, the
head of the Irrigation Department, told how
because Alfred Affable arid his fellow legisla-
tors had not then done their work properly, the
tremendous irrigation policy which might do so
much for Australia, which means almost every-
thing to the interior, has not been the blessing it
ought to have been. Mead was telling the Mel-
bourne Commercial Travellers about “Irrigation
from the National Point of View,” and so effective
were his facts and figures that even the conserva-
tive bagmen were moved to cry “ Shame !” and
“ Disgraceful.” In one short, plain statement be
summed up the lesson that without an effective,
disintegrating land-tax, all land settlement,
whether with or without irrigation, is vain and
futile :
Along one road in the Rodney district there were a few
years back 28 houses, each on a 320-acre farm ; now there
are four estates and 24 abandoned farms. Again, in
the Goulburn Valley, there were once 19 families making
a living along a channel side ; to-day 16 are gone, and
The Borrowers.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Why should our sweaty toil profane this temple
of the sun,
When we may stroll by creek and plain with fish-
ing-rod and gun,
Or in the velvet lap of hill be basking ?
Why should we dim the golden Now with squalid
sorceries
Of belted pulley, pick or plough, to earn our bread
and cheese,
When banquets we may borrow for the asking ?
When London millions yearn to pour into our
treasure chests,
With fifty years to pay the score, who can it be
protests ?
The pale-faced student hazed by droll statistics,
The doting sire who fears his sons will drown
beneath his debt,
k aint honesty who never win a bosomed woman
yet,
And all the queer corroboree of Mystics ?
The Mystics ! Listen to the tune their “rattled”
voices rave—
‘No debtor nation is immune when tyrants would
enslave ;
Nay, loans are baits which sergeants of Reaction,
Roaming like lions to devour, but bleating, bleat-
ing ‘ Peace! ’
Give to regain within his power the new
democracies,
Whereupon to leech again each lost exaction.
“The bonded debtor must obey whate’er his lord
demand.-,
Your very laws his will shall.sway, control your
very lands,
Supplant the good, and fix the bad tradition ;
Should you desire to somewhat ease your wearied
workers’ task,
Yea, if from Caesar o’er the seas you further rights
would ask,
You first shall crave your creditor’s permission.
“ Your very pulses beat in time to his decadent
heart,
Imagination dare not climb o’er his prosaic art,
In credal oubliettes religion lingers ;
For subtly through your tapestry the gnomes of
Mammon shoot
Conventions of the miserly and ethics of the
brute,
And smudge it with the ordure .of their fingers. .
“And all the sin and blood that stain the gleaming
of his gold
On them who borrow light again, like Nibe-
lungen’ Hold !
We weary of the prophet and his prosing
Whate’er they say ’tis surely wise to take the
loans we can
And build a present paradise for woman and for
map,
And leave the Mystic on his column posing !
’Twere folly to refuse the breeze our bellied for-
tunes hold,
Whose fathers crossed uncharted seas for flimsier
lures of gold,
Whose faithful sons will guarantee our ventures !
For Golden Point and Bakery Hill were mere
mirages to
The Eldorado yields that will reward the patriots
who
Hypothecate the future with debentures !
When Bull is anxious to endorse a pro-note for
the Cup,
Why should we cripple heart and horse at grub-
bing messmates up?
Why gird at bribes our Parliament disburses,
When, for a yearly song we pay, we needn’t vote
at all
But go to football every day, and—when the
bailiffs call,
The dead are deaf—e’en to their children’s
curses !

At last the Commonwealth is to have its
defence flotilla. But it still awaits being floated
along the calm scream of closer land settlement to
the safety of increased population. This will be
achieved only when the right leader, in conjunc-
tion with D.C.L. —the right brand of whisky—is
led bv the illuminating light of that scholarly in-
spire/ to the golden goal of a wise progressive
policy.*
three men hold the whole huge area. Unless some steps
are taken to prevent the accumulation of huge holdings
the State might as well fill in its channels and let the
land revert to its original bush.
Alfred Deakin tried irrigation without a pro-
gressive land-tax. It has had years of trial—and
there is the result. Obviously it is a rank failure.
But the State Governments have for years past
known that it was a failure; and still they have
done nothing. Some of them perhaps didn’t want
to do anything ; those who did want to do some-
thing looked at the special representatives of Fat,
the Leg. Councils, and put the job aside as hope-
less. But Deakin is not in that position. He
alone of all the leaders of Governments in Aus-
tralia has no House of Property to consider. His
Senate is elected on the same broad franchise
as his House of Reps.—the broadest franchise in
the world. Hence Deakin can easily do what
some of the State Premiers probably don’t want
to do, and which all of them might find some diffi-
culty in doing. From the results of his own
thwarted irrigation policy, he must know that the
thing wants doing ; and yet, though he knows that
it wants doing, he waits for it to be done by
men who, even if they wanted to do it, would
have great difficulty in doing it properly and
possibly in doing it at all. Is it lack of patriotism ?
Or is it just cowardice ?
“J.A.M.” writes: “Ringbarked,” in his
reference to Mungery estate and Peak Hill (B.
5/8/’O9), is barking up the incorrect arboreal sub-
stance. Am given to understand that the 55,000
acres are cancelled leases ; also that, in all, 90,000
acres are to be thrown open. The maximum area
of blocks is 1500 acres, but the average allotment
will be about 1000 acres, and will thus settle 90
families, instead of “ about three dozen,” as stated
by “Ringbarked.” Also, Peak Hill district,
instead of being a wilderness, possesses one of the
finest wheat belts in N.S.W. The soil is partly
volcanic, and—even without the aid of superphos-
phates—the average yield is over 12 bushels. The
rainfall for 17 years (which does not include the
wet year of 1889-90) is 20’94, or just six points
under 21 inches. This is rather higher than
Wagga and other places inSouthernßiverina. Mr.
J. Waks’ agricultural display at the recent show
also indicates what the district can produce when
properly cultivated. He had 50 varietiesof wheat,
20 of oats, 12 of barley, five of rye, 17 of millet,
and 18 of maize. After that there were 60 samples
of cereals in bags, 19 varieties of peas and beans,
and several sorts of grasses. All were well-grown,
and would have done credit to any exhibition in
the State. This district has been handicapped
for want of a railway (which “Ringbarked”
appears to begrudge us), while our good money
has gone to build up your metropolis. If we are
reckoned to be on the edge of the drought country,
The Bulletin should be helping us instead of
giving us a side kick. [As a side issue, The Bul-
letin mentions that the above was written in such
an incomprehensible fist that a good deal of the
yarn is guess-work. For instance, the sentence
which says, “ This district has been handicapped
for want of a railway ” might almost as well have
read", “This elephant has been flabbergasted by
hump of Unitarianism.”]
—
“ Malacoota ” : The workings of the official mind
in this wide loan land are hard to follow. On the
main sea road between Sydney and Melbourne
lies a long strip of coast littered with wreckage
and the bones of drowned and perished travellers.
Beginning with the wreck of the Monumental
City, at Talleberga Islet, just south of Cape Howe,
in ’ 65, and ending, so far, with the total dis-
appearance of the ketch Orme and its six fishers out
of Cunningham, last month, the record, on a
rough reckoning, can be set down at 21 vessels.
This argosy of disaster —steamers, ships and
ketches —has come to grief between Gabo and the
Snowy. Yet between Gabo and Mario, at the
Snowy bar, there is yet no telegraph line—about
72 miles of unoccupied coast where a liner might
come to grief or an invading army be landed and
Australia be none the wiser until the inevitable
corpse turned up, if the corpse thought it worth
while. Cape Everard lighthouse stands in splen-
did isolation midway. If anything went wrong
at Everard it would take days to apprise
a wooden-headed department of the fact. Four
years ago the Federal went down along there with
32 voyagers—and presumably the dingoes fed on
washed-up bodies, some of which might have
come ashore with life in them. Petitions to have
Everard connected with Malacoota, the nearest
point of habitation, by telephone have hitherto
found a nice comfortable corner in the official
waste-paper basket. Until one of the big pas-
senger tanks runs ashore along the frontage of
this graveyard, and a Deputy P.M.G. is devoured
by dingoes, or an archbishop is found naked and
demented on the shore eating roots, Everard will
probably remain in strict solitude. A full week
elapsed before any definite search was made for
the permanently missing men of the Orme. The
crew leaves 17 orphans in Cunningham ; but, as
they are only fishermen’s orphans, the Powers are
not visibly wakened up. Yet they will wake
soon. Something horrible will wake them.
The fact that Victoria is cursed with about
£78.000 worth of bad debts due by fathers of
neglected children has drawn renewed attention
to the fact that men sent to “hard labor” in
Melbourne and thereabouts don’t even earn their
tucker. The Victorian Public Service Commis-
sioner is about to inquire into the management of
Pentridge Gaol ; but what is needed more than
that is an inquiry into the whole stupid, wasteful
penal system of the State. The gross cost of
managing Victoria’s prisons last year was £49,604 ;
the prisoners produced goods of the value of
£17,045, leaving a deficiency of £32,559. Yet
Queensland’s confinees produced a trifle more than
the gross cost of their upkeep and guardianship.
Also Germany has long since solved the problem
of making a delinquent maintain himself and his
gaolers. With this example before it, the State
that admits it is owed £78,000 by lazy, un-
principled parents, and that it can’t collect the
debts because it would be further out of pocket if
it gaoled the culprits, is either too dense or too
pig-headed to learn.
It is little wonder Britain has a vague feeling
that something is wrong, and that something
must be done to put it right. Here is a little
bunch of figures taken from the Statesman’s
Year Book for 1909 :
Pauperism : In 11900 England and Wales had 807,471
paupers ; in 1908 they had 928,671. In Scotland, paupers
increased from 106,850 in 1900 to 111,675. In Ireland,
the figures remained about stationary. The United
Kingdom’s bill for pauper relief was £13,834,419 in 1900 ;
in 1907 it was £16,694,782. (Figures for 1908 not avail-
able.)
Births : In 1900 there were 927,062 births in England and
Wales : 13,401 in Scotland ; 101,459 in Ireland ; total,
1,159,922. In 1907 (latest figures given) the births in
England and Wales were down to 918,042; in Scotland
to 128.789 ; and in Ireland to 101,742 ; total 1,148,573.
Emigration : In 1900 the people of British birth who
left for other lands numbered 298,561 ; in 1907 (no later
figures) the departures had increased to 395,680.
In 1907 Germany had 2,060,974 births—an increase
of a few hundreds as compared with 1900 ; and it
only lost 31,696 people by emigration. On a
steady average, Germany each year adds 750,000
more "people to its population than Britain does,
so the odds keep growing longer day by day.

The old lie that the Northern Territory is “no
place for a white man ” hasn’t got much life left
in it now ; but this latest report (20/7/’O9) from
the Acting Government Medical Officer there,
Dr. Innes Stephen, may knock out any vestiges
that remain :
As to malarial fever. There have been admitted to the
Palmerston Hospital during the last four months 11
cases. All were of the benign type, and most amenable
to treatment. No deaths have taken place in the hospital
from fever. In private practice I have had, during the
past four months, seven patients who came to Palmerston
for treatment for malarial fever ; every ease was of a
benign character, and responded promptly to appropriate
treatment. I have seen in Palmerston a few cases who
have contracted malaria in other countries and suffered
a recrudescence of the disease ; but such cases cannot be
fairly attributed to the Northern Territory. From my
own experience, and from the information I have
gathered from officials resident for a long period of years
in the Northern Territory, I do not believe that malarial
fevers of a malignant type comparable with those found
in the Western States of America, Mexico, Panama or the
West Coast of Africa, exist or have existed at any time in
the Northern Territory.
As to the general health of those resident in Palmerston
and the interior. On this point I will bring to your
notice the very healthy condition of the children. In
four months’ practice I have not seen a single infant or
child suffering from any disease requiring medical treat-
ment. In no part of the world have I se6n children
healthier or of better physique than in Palmerston, and
the same remark applies to such children who have come
under my observation from the interior. In my experi-
ence, gained in several countries, the health of
residents of the Northern Territory is unique. I never
before practised continuously for four months in a com-
munity, however sparsely settled, without being brought
into contact with some illness amongst the infantile
population. In gauging the health of a community, what
is technically known as “ Koch’s Index ”is used—i.e., the
percentage of sick children under 10 years of age, in any
given community. Judged by this standard, it must he
admitted that the Northern Territory is exceptionally
favored.

The N.S.W. Public Works Committee recently
got some evidence exemplifying the foolishness of
planting a city in the wrong place. Newcastle
has been growling for a long time re the inade-
quacy of its harbor. About half a mint of money
has already been spent in patching up the inade-
quate waterhole, and it was while the Committee
was considering how to spend another mint
or two in further patching that it got some
really interesting evidence. A witness re-
marked that the new patching scheme would
cost something like £1,850,000. It would cer-
tainly increase Newcastle’s shipping facilities
for awhile; but it wouldn’t make the alleged
harbor a safe place for large vessels in all weathers,
and he refused to guarantee that a lot
more patching wouldn’t be called for later on.
Then he went on to explain that Newcastle
shouldn’t be there at all—it should be a few miles
further north, on the shores of Port Stephens.
Port Stephens, he said, is a spacious natural
harbor. Hydrographical surveys show that it
contains a larger area of deep water than does
Port Jackson. The biggest liners and warships
could steam right up to its wharves and be safe
in any weather. Further, it is more convenient
than Newcastle harbor to the new coal fields.
In short, the evidence, was ,a scorching com-
mentary on the foolishness of Planting a City in
the Wrong Place. Perhaps it is too late now to
shift Newcastle to the right place, audit certainly
looks as if the lesson that Newcastle is yelling like
a legion of baresark foghorns won’t be heard in
time where it would do most good. But later on,
when the lamentable Yassberra has proved a rank
and costly failure, and some future person
rises up, with a eulogy of the Snowy River in his
mouth, to explain that Australia’s Capital is a
City in the Wrong Place, the things that will be
said about the people who planted it there, when
they had the awful example of Newcastle to warn
them, will be worth hearing.
State Frights had a day out recently at
Albury, on the Ma State’s side of the Murray.
Ma has an Influx of Criminals Act—a measure
passed in 1903 to prevent one State shooting
refuse into another State. A young fellow had
been found guilty in Victoria of larceny; but
having a pretty fair record he was let off with a
fine of £5 or a month. Yet, on the strength of
that, larceny being an offence which “might”
have been met with 12 months’ gaol, the young
fellow was nabbed as soon as he got into N. S.
Wales, and was charged under the Act. And the
Ma State’s beaks, having had it proved to them
that he “might ” have got 12 months, tiassed him
a sentence of three months —three times as much,
that is, as he got for the actual crime he had com-
mitted.
“The best issue that has appeared for some
time past.”
“The color work in the body of the work has
added much to its general attractiveness.”
“The illustrations are particularly good.”
“Fast settling down into an even stride, and
assuming something of a more definite character.”
“ Well up to its high-water mark of merit.”
“ A very Australian number of the Australian
magazine.”
If the Australian press says this of the August issue of
The Lone Hand, what ivill it say of the September
number ?

At Sydney Lyceum last Thursday, Mr.
Percy Hunter, Director of N.S.W.’s Tourist
Department, organised a biograph exhibit,on of
Cooma-Kosciusko views. The pictures are excel-
lent. They were taken last month, and show the
dreaded Monoro at its climatic worst. Motors
whirl out of Cooma laden with passengers and their
baggage. Then the tall rough hedge outside
Berridale is whisked on to the screen. The
motors halt, as is the way of motors, at the
local pub. The occupants appear cheerful, con-
sidering the allegedly appalling regions they are
in. Later, the voyagers are seen winding down
into Jindabyne, with the Snowy, a wide silver
streak, beneath them. They are next discovered
alive and well at the State Hotel which N.S.W.’s
Anti-Socialistic Government has built high above
the Kosciusko winter snow-line. Thereafter the
motor-travellers and their friends at the hotel are
displayed ski-ing, tobogganing, snow-shovelling,
careering down and clambering up hills, leaping
over obstacles, and otherwise working off the
superfluous energy which the Monaro climate in-
duces. There are folks of all ages there, from the
very small citizen who has to be carried in
places, to the o'dster who nears the seventh
age of dodder. None of them, unless the film
lies most villainously, is suffering from anything
more serious than bottled vitality, high spirits
and restlessness.

The hotel which the Wade Government
has built in the district which it alleged was
unfit for legislative habitation, looks a fine and
picturesque structure. Rivers, lakes, mountain
torrents and other assets of charm and value
in an ill-watered continent like this, surround it.
The roads appear to be perfect. In fact, as a
winter or other resort, Nature seems to have done
its durnedest for the Kosciusko district, and
N.S.W. has done the rest. Noticeably absent
from this picture-show was any view or reference
whatever to the Yass-Canberra locality. The
discreet eagerness with which the N.S.W. Tourist
authorities omit to draw the public attention to
the scenery, rivers, etc., of Yass-Canberra is only
equalled by the enthusiasm with which they
boom—winter and summer—the State’s show-
district, which is Monaro.

“The King of Cadonia” still has his
Sydney residence at Her Majesty’s; also his
Court, the Regent’s Court, and Miss Dorothy
Court. Already the vagrorn mouth-musician has
started to intone the Cadonian National Anthem at
113 street-corners, and there are other infallible
signs that the piece is taking muchly.

At Sydney Lyceum, the news and doings
of the world for the previous fortnight or so are
served up in attractive form. The French aero-
plane wings its flight across the English Channel
in a fine realistic manner that sends thrills down
the backbone, and almost impels a man to go out
and burgle a bank to get the funds to go and do
likewise. The men and women who took part in
the Australian Ice Carnival at Mount Kosciusko
live their partsoveragain on the glimmering screen,
and as they strut and glide shouts of recognition
rise from a delighted audience. Said that one night
there arose a howl as a man recognised his best
girl sweeping over snow and ice on the arm of a
hated rival. These moving pictures have their
disadvantages, and provide a new terror for those
who lead double lives. Altogether the programme
at the Lyceum is among the best that Mr. Spencer
has put on, which is saying a lot. This gentle-
man is an expert in catching bird and beast in its
domestic quarters, and some of the finest things
thrown on the screen have been his representa-
tions of bird and animal life. May the gods
move him to do likewise with Australian animals
and birds. It would be an interesting series.

“ The Bondman ” sojourns among Sydney
Royal dagoes for the last time on Friday night.
On the Saturday following. Bland Holt stages
that fruity old Drury Lane blood-curaler, “The
Flood Tide.” It is the Holt co.’s last dramatic
presentation before it (the co.) makes for Mel-
bourne and dissolution ; and so Sydneyites are
counselled to take a last gaze on the moribund
combination ere it is too late.

Turkey has always been an interesting
place to the man who could view it from a position
of absolute safety ; and the patron of Sydney
Palace is now in that happy situation. He can
sit in his plush chair and watch the sanguinary
riot that preceded the fall of Abdul the Damned,
and yet not have an uneasy feeling about his
neck. The worshipper of Dickens can revel in
“ Oliver Twist,” though how Mr. West got Oliver
to submit himself to the machine is beyond compre-
hension ; and there are dark suspicions that the
film is a fake. The recent naval review, whereat
Mr. “Whiskers” Ward made such an unholy
show of himself and his country, is hurled in the
face of the Sydney audience without causing it to
lose its head as did Mr. Ward. There are also
some fine pictures of religious festivals in Russia
which, judging by the films, is a place swamped
in sanctity. Altogether it is a good programme;
but, then, good programmes have been the order
of the day at West’s for a considerable time.
“Cinderella,” the panto, which created a
world’s record run in Melbourne, bids fair to do
the same satisfactory business at Sydney Cri. It
is running like mad in the presence of packed
houses. Responsible and other parties connected
with it are consequently overwhelmed with joy
and ready cash.

A large fount of musical richness has been
tapped by that courageous bantling, the Bank of
N.S. W. Musical and Dramatic Society. On a
night last week a BuLLETiN-ette strayed out of the
rain into the Sydney Y.M.C.A. Hall, and heard
some of the best music made by amateurs
in an over-toned city. The Bankers were
holding their second Orchestral Recital, and
were easily wrestling with a group of Sclavonic
dances by Dvorak. Later a spangled and very-
tough proposition by Tschaikowsky was solved
by the same interpreters. The outsider counted
li violins, and all the other goods—’cellos,
flutes, cornets, trombones and the rest—were
among those who also ran. Mr. W. H. McCarthy,
of the B. of N. S. W. staff, conducted. A
miraculously slender damsel with the pirati-
cal name of Van Heuckelum was at the
piano, and at intervals Miss Estelle Mabel Ward
raised her fine contralto in song. Her singing of
Tito Mattei’s “Story Land” made the Bul-
LETiN-ette quite grateful to the rain. None of the
male players wore long hair, but quite a number
of the long-haired sex were doing light labor in
the orchestra.

The seven sea lions now performing at
Sydney Tivoli take this scribe back at one bound
to the Melbourne Aquarium, and call up cool,
shadowed memories of the indoor pool, where the
seals used to play at hide and seek in the hot
weather, while hot and tired children gazed
enviously at their splashing, and flattened small
noses on the cold bars of the iron fence. The
Sydney Tivoli animals are 20 years ahead of the
ones that felt proud of themselves when they
caught the fish thrown by the trainer. Then-
specialty seems to be juggling and balancing ; but
they also make music, and when they applaud
with their flippers one realises with a shock that
there is humor even on an ice floe. It suggests
that the Eskimo may yet run a comic paper—
annual subscription lcwt. of blubber. The
Sprightly Sisters, Kremka Brothers, Vaude and
Verne, and Blake and Granby are the most note-
worthy of the land performers present.

Cinquevalli has left Australia. He put in
his last evenings at Adelaide Tivoli; and he has
taken with him his new assistant, an Adelaide
youth with a face like a gargoyle and a quaintlv-
humorous manner. (It is rumored that the com-
petition for that vacant billet was enormous.)
Cissie Curlette left for foreign parts by the same
steamer. R. H. Douglass and the unexpectedly
funny Scottish Meisters kept the show going till
the alleged Chinese magician came along, and
now other things don’t much matter. The
Rickards management declares loudly that Chung
is a true Chow. He doesn’t look it; he looks
more like Robert Brough. But (as the miners in
Bret Harte’s story said, after being dealt with
bv a stranger whom they had derided for wearing
lemon kid gloves) a man as can us,e his hands, the
way that chap can has a right to wear (or call
himself) anything he durn well pleases. Foster
Fraser has had a good week at the Royal, which
is now occupied by a strange melodrama, rather
mysteriously arrived from Maori land.
Foster Fraser is a big young man, curiously
old-fashioned looking. On the stage, he recalls
the portraits of Adam Lindsay Gordon. His
voice is a mixture. The base is certainly Scotch,
the top layer is American, and something in
between might be Lancashire. Only after several
hearings does one realise that it is a really
good voice, indicating in advance whether he is
about to be impressive or comic or sly. Sly
humor is always a safe card, and he plays
it often. In his matinee talk on -‘Women of
Many Lands,” he tells how one Asiatic race still
believes in marriage by capture. “ The young men
there actually run after the young women.
In more civilised lands, I believe ” A burst
of light soprano merriment takes up the joke,
several hundreds of murmuring voices explain it
to their neighbors, and he never finishes the sen-
tence. His lecture on personalities in the British
Parliament (with caricatures and photographs
thrown on the screen) is interesting to those who
know, but hardly attracts a general audience, and
he talks of not risking it again in the other capi-
tals. Siberia and Amer ca are his brightest sub-
jects ; the Balance of Power (mostly about the
Balkans) is his strongest. He holds that Britain
can’t really tell what Germany is up to, and
should be ready for anything. He has been
called a scaremonger, he says. France talked that
way before 1870. In Paris there are sculptured
figures emblematic of the provinces. One of them is
heavily draped now ; it is the lost Alsace. London’s
new statue of Queen Victoria is to have figures em-
blematic of the various parts of the Empire. (The
house sees what is coming, and gets very quiet.)
“ I hope none of us may live to see one of those
figures” —(a long pause)— "draped, because Eng-
land would not listen to a scaremonger!” The
phraser relies largely on screen-pictures, and talks
in the dark, with a serious five minutes in the
light at each end. He does not perorate, and
always finishes by wishing his audience good-
night. Off the platform he goes everywhere, and
gets filled up with some facts and heaps of in-
formation. He is going to be very popular ; and
he refuses to put pen to paper until he has formed
some broad general idea of the Commonwealth as
a base to start from.

“The Duchess of Dantzic,” which arrived
at Melbourne Her Majesty’s on Saturday, calls for
merely restrained enthusiasm. It is generously
gifted with scenes of infatuation which need
acting to save them from drifting into cheap
sentimentality. But acting is not the outstand-
ing feature of the present company, although it is
engaged in a “romantic opera” with an ex-
ceptionally coherent story. For instance, N.
Buonaparte in the play is a character of some
value ; but Wybert Stamford is an indifferent per-
son altogether. His Napoleon of Act I. seems a
morbid, gloomy crank, whiie his Emperor in the
two later acts is colorless and unemotional. Then
Miss Florence Young is hardly as satisfying as she
might be. She has one or two songs to sing, how-
ever, and renders them with good effect. Some
of the other people occur so rarely that
"they are just fugitive flashes on the backcloth of

life. D. B. O’Oonnor and Reginald Roberts are
the briefest flickers of color and song, while the
comely Miss Alma Vaughan is the faintest
glimpse of a Josephine. James Hughes, as
Lefebvre, who lifts Mrs. Florence Sans Gene
from the sloppiness of the washtub to the grandeur
of a coronet, raises a robust voice in a notable
drinking song in the first act. Andrew Higginson
is the boyish Adhemar (a part initially played by
•D. B. O’Connor), and he exchanges heavy little
nothings with Miss Fan Dangfo, whose part
was popularised in Sydney by Miss Betty Ohls.
Higginson and Miss Dango have little to do.
Victor Gouriet garbs himself as the atom Papillon,
a court milliner, and achieves a most successful
resemblance to a Dago organ-grinder. He has
one song to sing, with the physical and vocal sup-
port of a fine brown chorus, but his wheezes have
that even quality peculiar to plateaux or billiard-
tables. Two other ladies that might be mentioned
are the Misses Georgie Musgrove and Nellie
Wilson, whose unimpeachable curves just peep
in the seclusion of silk or satin. The music has
patches of brightness as well as plenty of “ body ”
in it, and chorus, dressing and scenery are about
the Williamsonian average—except that the last
soene, the Throne Room of the Tuileries, seems a
nude sort of place, especially in comparison to
the sartorial clamor of the surrounding courtiers.
Just prior to the entrance of Nap. the First, in
full Imperial splendor, a ballet of Follies emerges
to kick its legs for the pleasure of his bored and
haughty entourage. “ Dantzic,” when first pro-
duced in London, was described as “a drama
interrupted by music.” The interruption of a
ballet gives it a further claim to favor in this more
frivolous country.
If the plot of “The Bush woman ” (which is
plot °f fifty Cockney melodramas
adapted to Australian circumstances) had
been more intense in its interest and in-
genious in its involutions, the honesty of
its local color, both in scenery and charac-
terisation, would have ensured a good run for
Jo Smith’s “tale of the Blue Range.” Unfor-
tunately, the motive has been weakened by
adaptation, and as the construction is flimsy the
drama s range of outlook is decidedly blue. On
Saturday night the performance had bad luck.
The gun that should have slain the aboriginal re-
fused to go off. also a horse that was wanted
to > cross a bridge basely jibbed at the con-
tract, and spoilt the effect of a quaintly
original situation. Likewise, the giant tree
which fell to the rescue of Roy Redgrave in his
hour of need was found to have had its top sawn
off, whereas it might as easily have been presented
in a more convincing form. But after making
due allowance for the shortcomings of a first per-
formance, The Bulletin must admit that the new
melodrama is insufficiently hot and peppery. It
doesn’t inflame the sympathies of the Andersonian
audience. The tone is pleasant, but not loud
enough. But as a play of Australian life up-to-
date, elaborately mounted and rational in the
main, “The Bushwoman ” is at least respectable.
The conventional villain (Dunbar) has a more,
prominent part than Roy Redgrave as the
soft-headed hero. That he merely shoots an
aboriginal who kills sheep to furnish some Hindu
hawker’s larder is not a shocking proof of his
criminality in the first place. The shot need not
have proved fatal. Billy’s death was almost due
to natural causes. Therefore the villain’s early
claims to wickedness hardly entitle him to gloat
subsequently over the thought of Roy Redgrave
being burned to a cinder. Edmund Duggan walks
stolidly through the part of the troubled farmer.
Max Clifton and Miss Erris are well placed in
characters outside of the plot; Bert Bailey
restricts himself to a reasonable sketch of a mili-
tary veteran, and two actresses imported from
England the other week show no reason whatever
for their journey. Miss Daisy Scudamore, as the
heroine, is more unattractive than amateurish ;
the other lady—Miss Olive Wilton—has both of
these defects in an equal degree.
“Othello,” at Melbourne Royal, has
arrived at that point of popularity where hard-
faced citizens purchase standing room only at the
upset price of half a crown a foot, or ss. for two
legs. In short, the dusky gaudy Moor is a record-
breaker. He has taken the cake. No previous
Othello was ever such a profit in this country as
the dark-brown African who is known as Oscar
Asche when he walks abroad washed and in
his white mind. Local Shakspearian students are
writing long letters to the dailies on the question
whether Desdemona should be silenced with the
old traditional bolster, or choked and stabbed as
m the present presentment of her murder. And
Oscar Asche is justifying his innovation with long
letters in reply, loaded with quotations from the
Divine text, and fired staight at the hearts of his
critics. The Bulletin is duly impressed by
Asche’s arguments as regards Desdemona’s
decease, but in the interests of controversy this
journal challenges him to explain how it
happens that the gallants of Cyprus supply
the chorus to lago’s song at the first time
of hearing it. lago, who, by the way, cannot sing
worth a cent, brought his feeble ditty from Eng-
land, he says. Unsober Cassio has not heard it
before. The gallants of Cyprus are equally un-
acquainted with English drinking songs, never-
theless they rush at the chorus with a familiarity
born of frequent rehearsal. Here is matter for a
special meeting of the directors of Melb.’s Shalt-
speare Society, wethinks. To-night (Thursday)
and to-inorrow “The Taming of the Shrew” will
be played ; but for Saturday two performances of
“Othello” are promised, and the triumphant
tragedy will be continued next week—after which
“ As You Like It.”

“The Flag Lieutenant,” transferred to
Melbourne Princess’s, is just now experiencing
the piping times of Agricultural Show week, but
a more solid attraction will be staged on Satur-
day. A revival of “The Village Priest,” with
Titheradge in his old character of the Abbe who
prays for a miracle and gets it, is the entertain-
ment in view. Melbourne has lost sight of “ The
Village Priest ” for many years; nor was it
Titheradge who played the name part in the later
revivals of Sydney Grundy’s drama. During this
bygone period the original Tith. has been frosting
his hair and otherwise qualifying himself still
further for the character which is remembered as
one of his very best. Therefore his reappearance
will be something of an event to be received with
sincere thanks and thunders of applause.

At Melbourne Town Hall the Amy
Castles concert season has been prolonged into
the present week, and the trill of the songstress
will be repeated to-night (Thursday) and on
Saturday. Opinions differ as to what is actually
best and second best in the warble of Amy
Castles, whereas the sweetness of her tone and
the soothing quality of her smile go without dis-
cussion. Also the merit of the co. in general is
loudly recognised. Peter Dawson, the light basso
or baritone, fully accounts for his reputation ; and
the tenor, Anderson Nicol—the only non-Austra-
lian member of theco.—has a voice that carries its
own recommendation to the back of the South
Gallery.

Foster Fraser, after stirring Adelaide to
its vitals with his tales of America, Russia,
Siberia, the British House of Commons, and other
foreign places, is now talking to Melbourne at the
Masonic Hall. _ Next week he will visit Ballarat
and Bendigo for lecturing purposes, and as his
weeks in Australia are limited the present oppor-
tunities of hearing what Foster Fraser has to say
will presumably be the last that Melbourne will
get.

Rosina Casselli’s toy dawgs, late of Sydney,
are now submitting the fruits of their education
to the patrons of. Rickards in Melbourne. The
unnatural achievements of these small, dumb
animals are very interesting, and the fact that
they seem happy in their absurdities is noted
with satisfaction. But, after all. performing dogs,
reconciled to their fate, are less pleasing to a
thoughtful observer than a small boy turning
somersaults at his own instigation. Another
recent addition to the Opera House bill is the
turn of Brown and Robinson, who sing duets in
the disguise of British bricklayers. One of them
makes it very evident in his gestures and postures
that he hasn’t moulded his style after the Aus-
tralian working man.
The latest thing in trades unions is the Theatrical
Managers’ Association in Melbourne. The members
include J. C. Williamson, Bland Holt, Clarke, Mey-
nell and Gunn, William Anderson, Allan Hamilton,
C. Spencer, Harry Rickards, J. Brennan, ,J. and N. Tait,
West’s Pictures and Hugh Ward. Clyde Meynell is chair
man, pro tem. ; E. J. Tait is hon. treasurer, and Phil Finkel-
stein, hon. secretary. The Bulletin is pleased to see the
trades union principle spreading among these people.
Yet when the great Victorian railway strike was started,
solely in defence of the trades union principle, the editor
of this paper, in a moment of cussedness, circularised a
number of respectable people for subscriptions, and
pretty nearly the only thing that he could find in the
hat when it came back was J. C. Williamson’s enthusi-
astic disapproval of the whole trades union idea. There
wasn’t a penny in the belitopper from any of the per-
sons above mentioned, and the burnt aspect of the
inside of the headgear suggested that someone had
been cursing in it with a devastating flow of language.
And though ten members of the Solicitors’ Union were
applied to they didn’t pan out one copper.
Walter Shakspeare Bentley, in a recent Sydney lecture,
produced another answer to the bald-headed arid staring
query, “ Why Don’t Men Go To Church?” In Walter’s
opinion it is because clergymen can’t elocute gracefully.
If the shepherds would only learn to wave their hands in
a heavenly manner and put tears in their voices, the
mime thinks men would fill the vacant pews, and the
collection plate would rattle like an iron roof in a hail-
storm. It is the sort of reason an experienced actor
might be expected to advance ; but there are many
things that even decent acting can’t mend, and back-
sliding is one of them. Some training in elocution would
no doubt mitigate the awfulness of the usual preacher ;
but even if every pulpit puncher were, a Julius Knight
and had reliable limelight men to assist, the average man
would not forsake his Sunday morning rest and buckle on
a stiff collar to go and listen to him. Regarded purely as
an entertainment, the church service is not worth
while ; and anyhow, the man who goes to church simply to
hear another man recite is a doubtful asset to anv sect
with which the collection plate isn’t the whole considera-
tion. The truly religious soul isn’t the one who sits back
and wonders why the curate, when he desires to impress
a statement on the congregation, jerks his arms like a
man throwing away a banana skin. Such a one may be
able to contribute thrippenee as well as the most devout
deacon, but from a Christian standpoint he remains the
usual bit of lighted timber.
THE BUSHWOMAN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Now an incidental squatter
Had a nephew—O ! a “ rotter”—
With the nature of a'townsman and the manners
of a cad.
Who loved a farmer’s daughter.
For his own he’d fain have bought her,
Though she knew the vain pretender was unques-
tionably bad,
For his clothes were built in Melbourne, and a
lurid sneer he had.
She was full of warm affection
Fora “ boy ” on a selection,
And her fatner smiled serenely on the gallant
hero’s suit;
So their future, like the present,
Might have cloudless been and pleasant.
But the squatter’s town-bred nephew was an ill-
conditioped brute—
lhe spider in the ointment or the rift, say, in
the lute.
He’d a gun, and pulled the trigger
When he caught a local nigger
Stealing mutton in the morning—yea, he shot
poor Billy dead.
Then he swore, all truth concealing,
That the farmer did the stealing,
And he fixed the crime of murder on the gallant
hero’s head.
He swore the young selector had the blood of
Billy shed.
He plotted on, and courted,
Still his schemes were ever thwarted.
He thought to cook the hero when he set the bush
afire ;
And only by the dropping
Of a, tree the girl was chopping
Was the villain disappointed of his wicked heart’s
desire.
Sure, the god of drama never leaves a hero to
expire.
Then a colored Hindu alien,
Who had seen the black Australian
Robbed of life for stealing mutton in the early
morning gray.
To the simple truth attested ;
So the villain was arrested.
And the hero hugged his girl and said: “The
clouds have passed a wav.”
Which was just what all his hearers had expected
him to say.
VICTORIA.

AT POVERTY POINT.
“Gamboge”: Fragments from the studio chat of
veteran W. J. Wilson (recently deceased) in his barn-like
Sydney atelier: “While 1 was painting ‘The Siege of
Sebastopol,’ at Coppin’s Cremorne Gardens, Brooke would
come in the afternoons and paddle about the lake. He
did not seem to care for Shakspeare—he was just an
executant of surpassing gifts. His face was inexpressive ;
the magic lay in his voice and a thoughtless kaleidoscope
of beautiful statuesque attitudes. My store of portraits
has been much admired. Here’s Barry Sullivan. Accord-
ing to him, there never were but two actors. The other
one was Macread.v, the apotheosis of Dan Barry. Rig-
nold? Oh, Kignold was a shrimp to him. And here’s
Harwood—clever, but was he an actor? I don’t know.
Acted everything, from Macduff to clown. It’s a moot
point whether he or Cathcart acted the most characters
in “ Hamlet." He used to tell how he was working in a
sawpit up the bush, and sighed when he saw the jolly
actors and actresses passing in Cobb’s coach. These
photos, of Billy Dind, manager Tolano, and Charley
Young make me think that the droll characters 1 have
seen about the stage, especially in Sydney, would furnish
forth a Dickens. ... Of course, vou’ll say it’s the
cobbler remarking that there’s nothing like leather ; still
I do claim for my own noble art the largest share in
public education through the stage. The scenic artists
in Australia have included Opie, Fry, Holmes, Pitt, Hen-
nings, Ben Tannett, Joe Tannett, Freyberger, Habbe,
G. Gordon, J. Gordon, Spong, Goatcher," Brunton, Cole-
man, and others. In 1869, after Johnny Fawkner’s
funeral, the Melbourne Royal gave the pantomime of
Ihe House that Jack Built.’ What excitement there
was over Hennings’ panorama of the history of earlv
Melbourne!”
“ Locust ” : A curious theatrical coincidence : Some
years since, at Portsmouth (England), a manager man
was producing a play called “ The Lost Paradise.” He
had his leading man and leading woman, and he had also
engaged a “strong character actor ” for a special part.
At the last moment the “ strong character ” man didn’t
turn up. The manager wired to his partner in London
to send someone in his place. The new man arrived, and
the piece was produced with success. So much by way of
preparatory averment. Now for the point of the story.
Tapping (of the Nellie Stewart co.) was the manager.
Gaston Mervale (Meynell and Gunn) was the leading man.
Marion Grey (of the Julius Knight co.) was the leading
woman. Oscar Asche was the strong character man
who didn’t turn up. Charles Cartwright was the London
partner of Tapping. And Arthur Styan (Bland Holt co.)
was the man engaged to fill the breach. Most of these
names have a niche (small or large) in Australian theatri-
cal history.
Along with the revival of the awful “ Face at the
Window” in Melbourne comes news that E. Hoggan-
hvphen-Armadale, who originally stage-managed and
produced the horror in partnership with the author, was
booked to leave England by the Suevic, arriving in
Sydney about the middle of September. Armadale placed
Le Loup 1600 times, but apparently prefers to remember
that he was for years with Henry Irving, and was in the
lrving-Terry co. when it toured America in 1887-8. He
comes this way on the unattached list, but with a cargo
of costumes and a trunk of MSS. in case of accident.
A performance of “ The French Maid,” in aid of the East
Melbourne CrCche, will happen at Melb. Princess’s
shortly. Florrie Green is arranging the show, and she
will take the name character. Two or three years ago
the accomplished Miss Green acted and sang' the part
almost as daintily as she danced it, and the reappearance
of that bright particular amateur star should prove a
powerful attraction.
What time Citiquevalli was appearing in Melbourne,
the Rickards advertisement persisted in describing him
as “La Incomparable.” The fact that Chinkv doesn’t be-
long to the softer sex is very strikingly illustrated when
he catches the cannon-ball on the back of his bust.
“Hiplien”: It struck me as curious t’other Saturday
night at Melbourne Royal to observe how a White Austra-
lian crowd was roused to hysterical applause by a play,
the hero of which is a colored man. It seemed note-
worthy that a member of the murky race should sway
the feelings of an Australian audience. Would not one
think that the idea of a black currishly suspecting, wan-
tonly maltreating, and finally murdering in cold blood
his white wife would be nauseating to popular sentiment?
Was it the genius of Shakspeare or the witchery of Asche
that made the black-hating, black-fearing Australian
audience applaud the sayings and doings of the more or
less noble Moor? It was not as if Asche'presented Othello
as a conventional immaculate stage hero, perfect in ail
things save the shade of his epidermis. He didn’t.
He showed Othello just as a nigger. The nigger didn’t
look pretty. His features and hue were those of our
black relation. His clothes were the glorified garb of the
Turkey-lolly seller. His wild outbursts of furious
jealousy were the characteristics of African blood. His
humble salaams to the Venetian Council were the ob-
sequiousness of Asia. \et people looked on with pleasure
and apparently without mental protest while the emble-
matical Black horribly strangled into oblivion his Desde-
mona. I may be foolishly sensitive, but there seems
something prophetic in the centuries-old drama of the
overwhelming and war-like Black and his soft, defence-
less white mate.
“One Who Pays”: Squeezed out at O-ear Asche’s first
night in “ Othello,” I squoze in for the second, and appa-
rently secured the very last stall. As for the gallerv, it
was no use looking at it after seven o’clock. Asche is
great., and Lily Bray ton is perfect as a lovely blonde con-
trast. Grim wood’s lago is an embodiment. In face he is
very like Edmund Kean in a miniature at the London
Garrick. Othello and lago were not like actors ; they
were a couple of real men—entirely contrasted ; thorough
studies ; symmetrical performances. Here Asche differs
from Kean and Brooke. Both were irregular; it was
Shakspeare read by flashes of lightning, as Coleridge said
of Kean, and Coppin of Brooke. They would travel
much on a level, and then burst out with overwhelming
electrics. Hazlitt said that Young, as Othello, was like a
humming top, and Kean, as lago, like a mischievous boy,
whipping him. Studying Hazlitt on Kean’s Othello, I
find that Asche misses all the chief points that Kean
made. I cannot say Asche is anywhere quite elec-
trical, but he has superb volume in every phase. With
all his unsurpassable English (or Australian) pronuncia-
tion, I think the basis is German ; a man cannot get away
from his kin (Scandinavian in this case) in one generation.
“ Billy T.” : A part author of “ The Flag Lieutenant ”
writes himself down “Major,” and, I assume, knows the
game, consequently there is significance in the shop talk of
his characters. It appears that>the aspiring young marine
thinks only of getting his “chance.” We don’t expect
the ethics of the disturbance to be discussed by the
smaller military or naval officer, but we might in our
innocence look for a fairly broad interest in the result of
the campaign, whereas we find the heroes thinking and
talking of nothing but their possible individual scores,
and the likelihood of bringing off a scoop. If “The
Flag Lieutenant ” is close to fact, a British officer like
Major Thesiger or Lieut. Lascelles regards a war as a
field offering him certain opportunities of pulling off a
striking melodramatic act that will result in his picture
being put in the papers. He wants to score 100 not out
or kick a goal. Probably it was this sentiment which
caused a great deal of the mortality among young officers
in the early part of the Boer War. Like Thesiger they
were out after an advertisement and they got it—on a
tombstone.
“S.”: I should have thought Miss Lily Brayton too
good an artist to yearn for “opportunities” precisely
after the manner of the average “ hamfat.” Yet this is
how she talks to a Melbourne interviewer: “ Desdemona
is a simple, quiet figure ; in it I get my opportunity in the
last scene, where her latent feelings burst forth.” Be-
shrew this common love of ranting! Why will actors
count nothing as an “ opportunity ” but the passages that
give them a chance to contort and perspire and execrate?
To my thinking, Miss Brayton is quite as artistic as the
“simple, quiet figure” as she is when storming at the
Moor for his Ethiopian bullheadedness. Desdemona offers
scores of occasions for delicate artistry, and the character
Miss Brayton presents is pellucid and beautiful; and yet
she counts the three minutes of anger and altercation at
the end her “ opportunity.
“F.M.": The “Sundry Shows” man is quite right
about “ Othello,” but why does he say that the play has
not been produced for 20 years? If that is true, lam
older than father admits. What about Wilson Barrett?
And what, oh what! about Carter Edwards as Iago?
This Barrett play is the one solid recollection I have of a
perfect play, and therefore I hate to see it forgotten.
Another question which this constant reader would like to
ask : Why did not Caleb Porter get cast for Iago? When
we rememoer his masterly study of Nero in “The Sign of
the Cross,” one feels inclined to get angrv because he
didn’t get lago for his own this time. In fact, in my
secret soul I had thought that was why he was brought
out here, and I have mentioned it in confidence to a few
friends, who have now discovered what a liar I am.
Surely Asche has no need to keep the other parts down,
and so give lago to a man utterly without personality.
The Gritnwood gentleman also seems to have a pain
amidships, as most of his soliloquies are delivered with
his hands pressed into that district.
“0.K.”: Perhaps it was by way of advertising- Oscar
Asche’s production of “Othello, the Moor of Venice,”
that Mulai Hafid, the Moor of Morocco, has been giving-
some choice illustrations of savagery at Fez. Mulai’s
treatment of people who desire his overthrow is lingering.
Prisoners, men and women, have their right hands cut
off and the stumps dipped in boiling pitch. Eyes are
gouged out, jaws smashed with a hammer, and wounded
hands are sewn up in leather gloves in order that the
fingers may grow into the palms. What the Sultan does
with a Desdemona when he believes her giddy is not
stated in the latest reports from Fez. Probably lie orders
the lady to be divested of her ears, eyes and nose.
Yet M. Hafid is merely the ordinary Moorish potentate,
and he is doing nothing out of the ordinary Moorish
track. This sort of thing has gone on in Morocco for
hundreds of years, and the Moors are now fighting the
valiant, but utterly incompetent, Spanish army to keep it
going on. Forty-nine years ago Marshal O’Donnell, a
Spanish commander of much greater tonnage than any
of the present lot, dashed the Moorish army into a
cocked hat, and made such a swift march on the Sultan’s
principal city that he missed by only a hair’s breath when
be grabbed at the flying hind-leg of the brown potentate.
O’Donnell would cheerfully have stayed and tried his
hand at blotting out the whole Moorish infamy, but his
awful queen wanted a big indemnity to spend in drink or
other joys, and Othello’s country was abandoned. Pro-
bably Shakspeare’s Moor was just another Hafid veneered
a little by Venetian civilisation, and if O’Donnell had had
a chance to wipe out Othello the world might have been
cleaner for it. The sovereign of Othello-land, by the way,
has captured the boss rebel; the latter was brought to
the capital in an iron cage, and the Sultan went down
and spoke to him through the bars. A humorous poten-
tate would simply have said “ Pretty Cocky ” and gone
away ; but Hafid doesn’t seem to be humorous. Probably
he explained to the other fellow at length how many
weeks he would spend in dying, and how many different
ways he would perish before he was dead, and how dead
he would be before he was a corpse.
“S. Weller ”: How is this for turning the shower on
the Englishman’s tub controversy? During the second
act of “ The Flag Lieutenant,” one of the hawfully Hing-
lish officahs, explaining why the enemy have" ceased
firing, opines that “ they have gone to pray, or wash, or
some other heathenish rot.”
CONFESSION.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I love a silly sort of play !
I like to see the clown fall down,
If clown there be (there mostly is),
And limp in a pain-stricken way
When he gets up ; his funny phiz
Prevents a bloke from feeling brown.
For this I should not be abused—
I’m very easily amused.
I laugh with ease. I simply roar
• To see the thick youth, wildly gay,
And evidently weak of mind,
Dunlopped and very stout before
And loosely pantalooned behind.
I love to hear his joyous bray !
And I don’t ask to be excused—
I’m simply easily amused.
I like to see stage-foolers biff
Each other on the hollow cheek ;
And, though the scene has oft occurred,
I bellow just as loudly if
The critic says it is absurd,
And that the humor’s forced and weak.
Oh, no ! To plays I’m not unused,
But—yes, I’m easily amused !
When now the comic acrobat
In perilous positions twists,
To prudence paying little heed,
And then sits fairly on his hat,
I laugh uproariously indeed ;
And when the knave who then assists
Falls down and gets his wish-bone bruised—
I know I’m easily amused !
Hold up, ye hypercritics, then,
And give the silly ass a show,
Who suffers pain (apparently)
To wake the mirth of stolid men.
He does his giddy best to be
A goat, and it is better so 1
I never blush when I’m accused
Of being easily amused !

THE LOST ENCORE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Mr. Edwin Geach yesterday received news that his
“Englishman’s Home” company had been held up at
Murtoa by the floods, whilst on board the Adelaide
express, bound from Adelaide to Sydney.— News item.
The actors frowned on the rolling’ flood and folded their
white, round arms;
They’d faced all stage emergencies, they were used to all
stage alarms ;
They’d all of them given their brief stage lives a hundred
times or more.
But they simply frowned
When they might have drowned
To the yells of a last encore.
The actors glared at the wild, wet waste, like villains too
cheaply foiled ;
The engine-driver got from his cab and whistled and
crawled and oiled ;
The flood rolled by like the surging mob that breaks on
the early door.
But the actors frowned
On the high, dry ground
And neglected that wild encore.
The actors shrank from the whirling blast that howled
on the sodden plain
(It much resembled the mob’s glad shrieks when the
villain writhes in pain) ;
Then the flood crawled up and licked their boots like a
hound upon the floor.
But they didn’t crave
A watery grave
At the price of a loud encore.
The actor-man—and the limelight-man who perches high
in the wings—
They’re very good ’midst fluff and wood but they’ hate
Life’s actual things ;
When all the sea is made of cloth and of wood is the
fretted shore
Then they do right well,
And they-proudly swell
To the crash of the wild encore.

KANGADOLPHUS: “ What makes you so sad ,
Emmie dear? ”
EMCLINE : “ Ere been viewing the Australian
Aerial League's procession and noting the
names of the flying machines. There's the
Curlew, ’ the ‘ Magpie,’ the Albatross ,’ the
' Hawk,’ and even the common old ‘Crow,’
but not one of them has been named after me,
and I’m a (sob) better Australian than any
of them!”
What becomes of the hopelessly broken
down steamer which has no wireless telegraphic
installation on board, which has wandered right
out of the ocean highways, and which is not
picked up, yet hasn’t the luck to sink? Possibly
owing to stormy weather, or owing to profound
belief in luck, no attempt is made to send boats
ashore until the vessel has drifted so far from the
land as to make the experiment almost hopeless.
Possibly the breakage has happened so far from
land that the attempt is hopeless from the first.
Probably in the end a desperate effort is made to
send news ashore and report the direction of the
drift, and the boats are never heard of again. Away
down in the southern sea-wastes, where the waves
roll right round the world, very few boats are ever
heard of again. Then the long waiting resumes,
and the drift continues south—it is the vessel that
drifts south which is most likely to end its days as
an Ishmael of the deep. Not very long ago a
broken down steamer took the utterly hopeless
road to the South Pole, and only amazing luck—
the luck of the individual who tires in the dark at
a florin half a mile away and hits it—brought a
sailing vessel that was hundreds of miles out of
its course to the rescue. The captain and crew
abandoned their derelict, and a fool of a Maori-
land marine court fell heavily on the captain for
doing it. Yet if he hadn’t done it all hands would
have died either of hunger or frost, for despite
much searching the vessel was never picked up,
and a hopelessly disabled ship is as easy to find
without a crew on board as with one. Probably
there are a good few vessels which start out on
the same road, but haven’t the same streak of good
fortune.
There is an ever-thickening blanket of gloom
as the big dead thing that was once the good ship
Ishmael keeps on its southern track, further and
further away from all possibility of rescue. A
time comes when the prospect of aid becomes so
blank that the habit of scanning the bald rim of
the horizon almost dies out. The smoking-room
card game is abandoned, and the music is dead,
and the ship’s humorist is silent. The tanks run
dry, and condensed water —flat, greasy and taste-
less —is used instead. The passengers are re-
minded of how long they have been adrift when
the cigars give out. They are reminded still
further when the liquor gives out. The meals
grow slipshod, and the disappearance of one small
item after another suggests that the stores are
getting low—still there is probably abundant food
of a kind among the cargo. An unshaven, untidy
aspect creeps over the company—the aspect
which suggests utter loss of hope and a perfunctory
washing of shirts and collars in salt water.
The vessel rolls lazily in the eternal trough
of the sea, and there is a tendency to look
over the side as it rolls, just as Van-
derdecken might have done, to if
weeds and barnacles are accumulating. The
weather grows colder and colder. Some one
breaks the dead monotony by going mad. Some
one else breaks it in another place by going over-
board. A few get bursts of religions frenzy. Pos-
sibly some get married ; many marriages are made
on board ship, and it is just as well to die mar-
ried as single. Also there is this great advantage
about marriage on the dead ship Ishmael. going
south, that one need take no thought for the mor-
row —neither about income nor trousseau nor a
dwelling house nor furniture nor any other of the
usual details—for there isn’t any morrow.
Then at long last the ice appears ahead. The
end may be sudden if the ship bumps hard ; but if
it finds itself an accidental haven among the ice its
sinkage may be long postponed, and the end of
the tragedy may hang fire for years. It is hard to
say how long a final survivor may last while
waiting for some rare Antarctic explorer to pick
him up —years, may be. And all these gruesome
possibilities arise because owners send big ships
to sea without the wireless telegraph aboard, and
because Governments, afraid of “ undue interfer-
ence with the liberty of the subject,” allow them
to do so. The trouble is that those who could
best tell the story of how badly that apparatus is
needed never come back to tell anything.
A Sydney mariner writes :
The Bulletin for July 15 contains a paragraph anent
the small sailing craft on the coast. Among many
truisms, your correspondent states that there are not
enough mates left to man said small sailing vessels, be-
cause the steamers have grabbed them all. I wish they
had, then I wouldn’t be annoying you with this despatch.
Also, it is alleged that the skippers engage an extra man
to do the work for the aged mate. Is this an Ananias
competition ?
Mates ! There are enough mates in Sydney to carry
the durned craft, let alone sail them. Can any reason-
able man expect a mate to rush a job where he has to
work cargo, mostly hardwood, nine hours a day, ex-
clusive of meal hours, for the large sum of ss. 4d. per
diem. You work the cargo in and out. Of course,
you have all the day to yourself after 5.30 p.m.; but as
you must dress to go ashore it considerably curtails the
evening, and all shops are shut at 6 p.m. The mate also
takes his trick at the wheel. Most of my spare time was
employed picking splinters out of my hands and else-
where. The commander, chief officer and crew probably
dine on deck, the cook taking the wheel while food is in
progress. You chase round for a snug spot, out of the
wind if possible. The skipper generally rushes the
galley, to the exclusion of the common herd.
As a change and in fine weather, these picnic meals are
all right, but for a continuance they pall on one. I must
say the food is good and plentiful. There is usually a
small cabin with a bunk for the skipper on one side,
ditto on t’other side for the mate. No sanitary accom-
modation for anybody. The crews are mostly hard-
working, hard-drinking Scandinavians. Perhaps some
patriotic owners would do more towards the safety of the
Empire by employing their countrymen than by contri-
buting towards Dreadnoughts. If there were fair wages,
good accommodation, and less of the timber-lumping
business, I am sure there would be no dearth of mates.
It is asking a great deal from a man to risk his ticket for
ss. 4d. a day—and a very long day at that.
The N.D.L. steamer Borkum, which
reached Port Adelaide last week, had a voyage
that came straight out of a Joseph Conrad yarn.
Six days out from Natal the ship was found to be
on fire. The fire, though it could be held in
check, could not be got under ; and there were
4000 cases of dynamite below ! It took seven
hours to dump that lot overboard. There were
besides, 1400 cases of gin and a lot more spirits in
cask; all of it was wastefully mixed with the
Indian Ocean. Next day an examination of the
supposedly-smothered fire showed that it was still
burning cheerfully, so smouldering paper and
clothing and other mixed goods went over the
side too, and the captain thought it time to run
for the nearest land. When the vessel got to
Port Louis it had been on fire for five days, and had
left 250 tons of valuable cargo trailing behind it.

“ O.K.’ on shaves and Sabbaths
I would speak of Sunday shaving in its moral, political
and artistic aspects. One of my earliest recollections is
of a certain Anglo-Fr.nch.nan, or Franco-Englishman,
who.afterlivinginLondon for 40years,htid transferred his
household to Paris. On one of his occasional visits to his
native city he was asked-whether he intended ever to
return there to settle. The voluntary ex-patriot replied :
“My friend, England is a country win re you can’t get
hot rolls on Sunday morning. It isn’t/tt to live in.” I
became an anti-Sabbatarian on the spot. But to-
day I find myself in a country where there- are
neither beers, nor hot rolls, nor clean shaves to
be bought 011 the Sabbath Day. Both in Sydney
and Melbourne barbers have lately been fined for
lathering and scraping the countenances of fellow-
men on the Dav of Rest, the law be 1 tut enforced
not at the instance of Sabbatarians, but in the interests
of trades unionism. This assertion of the working barber
men’s right to as much weekly holiday, and as much pro-
tection against non-unionist competition as other
workers, meets with the approval of all right-thinking
citizens, but it doesn’t shake my conviction that the Law
which serves the workers’purpose is the mere slave of
Sabbatarianism. Why should not every barber’s shop be
open on Sunday morning, and every barber have one
whole holiday and a half in the week ? The employment
of more labor would permit of new holiday arrangements
for the shavers, and enable every citizen to buy a shave
seven dnvs a week, if he wishes it. Not the interest of the
worker, but the bigotry of the Puritan is considered in
the Sunday Closing Acts—the Puritan who deplores
“ the Continental Sunday.” and the never-ceasing anima-
tion of cities in “Roman Catholic countries’’-the killjoy
who turns upwards his mirthless eyes, which all the time
are wilfully blind to the fact that'“church attendance ”
is far more numerous 111 countries which have no Sunday.
closing law than m those that lie under the sombre shade
thereof. For the dirty chin of the unshaven on the sad
Sabbath—a day so sad in Melbourne, Adelaide and other
conceive its state of depression—for the loss of self-
respect which befalls thousands of untidy Christians
once a week, Sabbatarianism is primarily respons-
Ible. Men stay away from church because they
are compelled to “cheat the barber” on Sunday.
Other men, who love to parade their godliness, let their
face nair grow that they may avoid the sin of having a
stubbly chin, as they pray aloud or take up the collection,
And Heaven knows that the “Nonconformist heard,”
and Wesleyan whiskers are Sabbatarianism’s most wicked
results. Therefore, brethren, it behoveth Ihe Labor party
to see that the sin of Sunday closing of barbers’shops,
which is a sin against the Lord, shall no longer he
charged to the account of trades unionism, but be
sheeted home to the hairy saints who have made the
Commonwealth Sunday what it is.
One result of the recent washaway on the
western Victorian railways was that all S. A.
went without its Bulletin on Sunday, for the
first time since inter-State railways were opened.
Thursday afternoon’s express carries the paper,
and that express took root at Stawell. It played
a cricket match there. A prominent S. A. cleric
preached there on Sunday. The sleeping-car
people lived on board, and everybody else lived
at hotels—at the expense of the Victorian Govern-
ment. Finally the mis-named “express” got
into Adelaide in the small hours of Monday
morning. Thursday’s travellers in the other-

MILLIONS OF MILES!
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The planet Mars is hastening towards the earth at the
rate of about 200,000 miles a day. .. . Mars, like the
earth, is a planet, and circles the sun in its orbit. The
earth goes about the sun almost in a circle. As everybody
knows, the distance from the earth to the sub is nearly
33,000,000 miles, but its orbit does not so closely approxi-
mate a circle, for the sun is 13,000,000 miles away from
the centre, so that the greatest distance from sun to Mars
is 154,500,000, the leas distance 128,500,000 miles. —

Breathing Disease.
Infectious diseases are breathed into
the system from those affected with disease
or from bad smells; yet how many women
breathe daily the offensive steam from
common soaps made from rancid fats, and
keep their hands for hours in such solu-
tions, and the clothing from such soap
suds is worn next the tender skin. No
wonder disease and eczema are prevalent!
Users of Sunlight Soap know the differ-.

A case just decided in the S. Australian
Supreme Court is calculated to make Gent One
sit up and think hard. The Court said that an
old German resident was under delusions about
his sons’ bad behavior when he made a final will,
leaving half his property (£9000) to cousins in
Europe whom he had not troubled about for 30
years. Incidentally, it jumped heavily on the
lawyer who made the will. That lawyer was
frankness itself. He explained cheerfully that he
found the old man alert and bright considering
his age, and simply followed instructions. “If I
had thought the reasons for giving half his pro-
perty away from his children were insufficient, I
still would have done as he instructed. The
responsibility was his. ... If he had wanted not to
give anything to his children, I think I would have
spoken up. ... One of the reasons for my silence
was that he might have been offended and have
gone somewhere else with his business.” On
which the Chief Justice, admitting that the lawyer
was “in a position of considerable difficulty,” and
“thought he was doing what he was legally
entitled to,” blamed the whole litigation (the case
took 21 days to hear) on his “absence of
inquiry.” (One detail of the inquiry would have
been whether the old man or a son was right in
a police-court squabble they had in 1876 !) So, at
the end, the other side demanded that the executors
of the busted will—which presumably means their
lawyer—-should pay the enormous Costs of the
whole trial; and that point remains to be argued.
After this, any lawyer who prepares a will that is
rough on any member of testator’s family does it
at his own peril—as long, that is, as he does it in
S. Australia.
In Maoriland also Gentleman One has
been getting into trouble over something of the
same sort. This licensed hunter after Costs took
up a libel case of an obviously speculative
character on behalf of a person who had no means
to pay the other side’s Costs if the case went
against him. As it happened, the case did
go against him, whereupon the Judge called upon
Gentleman One .as an officer of the Court to see
that the defendant’s Costs were paid. If he failed
then, the Judge remarked drily, ways might be
found of dealing with Gentleman One for con-
tempt or something of the sort.
In the Melbourne City Court, the other
day, the young man was advised as usual to marry
the girl ; whereupon he said he couldn’t, and
started to explain matters. He was 25, he said,
and was employed by the City Council at £7O a
year ; and he didn’t see ho«w he could do it on the
money. The City Court evidently didn’t see how
he could, either ; but the City Council itself may
solve the mystery. Or perhaps the City Council
doesn t reckon that a man should marry until he
is 40. And meantime—well, this case shows a
little part of what happens meantime.
AN INCENTIVE TO GOOD WORK.
DRESSMAKER : “ Some day I hope to get an order
for your trousseau.”
GEACIE : Well , that depends. Some girls would
hate no occasion for a trousseau if it were
not for the way they dress beforehand.”
The Bulletin suggests that a recent
scandalous mission business .suggests the need for
a bociety for the Prevention of Cruelty to Canni-

A DURABLE PERSON.
HOSTESS : “I don't see why you should complain. One of my hoarders was with me ten years
before he died.”
BOARDER: “By cripes! He wasn't a hoarder. He was an emu.”
“ Henry Horsecollar ” : A man who
wanders much about the long-settled agricultural
districts of N.S.W. where the old landed aristo-
cracy abides, and studies the ways of the lordly
animal that owns the soil, makes curious dis-
coveries. The city landlord is often objection-
able ; the one who hangs out in the old farming
districts is generally awful. His rents are usually
bad, but his pomp is almost alwavs worse. One
comes across districts where the tenant’s boy or
girl has learned to stand at attention and do a
bow and scrape or a curtsev when the stupendous
person goes by. Then there are places where
every family is said to include, if possible, a swift
and specially-trained boy whose duty it is to run
like Sheol when the potentate is seen coming, a,nd
open any gate that happens to be in the way.
Certain landlords, when they come
home from spending the rents abroad,
always expect the tenants to meet
them and cheer wildly and take the
horses out of the carriage and draw
the vehicle themselves as a spontaneous
token of joy at the rent-collector's re-
turn. One notable landlord has been
known to circularise his tenants,
directing that Smith or Jones must
not be employed under pain of non-
renewal of the lease, Smith or Jones
having, in some way not specified,
manifested a rebellious and disre-
spectful spirit. One rather notable
country landlord always prefers a
newly-arrived immigrant as groom or
rouseabout. It is one of the sights
of the neighborhood to see the great
earth-holder arrive from “town.”
The groom or rouseabout has got to the
station early with the great man’s
almost sacred boss. He takes off his
hat to the great man. He bows to
the great man. He sees the great
man safely bestowed on. the roof of
his hoss. Then he runs hard behind
the great man in order to arrive in
time to open the gate for the great
man and hold the foaming animal
while the stupendous person slides
off. But a landlord with a reputation
for morality is perhaps the limit. His
rents are high, and he is fond of
Chinamen, and he has many other
drawbacks, but at least he is moral.
It is a solemn belief among the ten-
antry that he carefully notes the date
of the marriage of any son or daughter
upon his property. He is also alleged
to carefully note the date of the baby’s
appearance. And if the baby seems
in undue haste it is charged against
him that he considers whether the case
calls for expulsion from the property
or some minor penalty down to mere
reprimand. I propose one of' these days to
make a collection of dried landlords and present
them to the Sydney Museum for public informa-
tion and instruction.

Sydney University has just driven the
last nail into the Fisher Library, which has taken
eight years to build and has cost £72,000. The
hall is to accommodate the Fisher bequest of a
library to the ’Varsity. From the architects’
point of view, the most striking feature of it is the
roof-constructed throughout of solid cedar, on
the hammer-beam principle, of which Westminster
Hall, London, built as a Parliament House in 1397,
is the most famous example. It is claimed that
the Fisher Library roof is only second in the
world to this, though only half its length and
50ft. wide, as against Westminster Hall’s 68ft.
It was found as the work went on that there was
not enough suitable cedar in N.S.W. to complete
the job, and latterly the logs have been dragged
at great expense from almost inaccessible places
in Queensland. Yet many people can remember
cutting down great N.S. W. cedar trees and burn-
ing them to make room for a few blades of grass
and a cow. v
“ Old Salt ” Avrites :
the Waratah has gone down in the open ocean, it
will be about the first case of a 10,000-ton ship being
overwhelmed in a storm. If it did not strike a rock on
the African coast, as the Wairarapa did the Great Barrier
Isle on the coast of Maoriland, the chances are that it is
still afloat, drifting helplessly around with broken
machinery. Repairs at sea are sometimes possible ; but
the reports of the weather indicate a general roughness
that would make any large repairs almost out of the
question. If the steamer has drifted into the Southern
Ocean and got caught in the Polar current, there is little
likelihood of calm water being reached till it is
among the ice j for the Southern Ocean seems to be one
of the masses of water that are in a perpetual state of
fret and upheaval. The great advantage of “ wireless ”
is that any ship fitted with it can summon assistance if
it is still afloat, and the long-drawn-out anxiety of rela-
tives is thus spared. If no wandering wave of electricity
came up out of the gloomy ocean to say where the ship
was it would be an absolute proof that it had gone down
on its regular track. Even the absence of news would
indicate something definite. The installation of “wire-
less ” would be but a trifle on the cost of building a big
steamer , and with the horror of the VVaratah on their
minds people will begin to pick out ships that have the
‘ wireless ” and travel by them. The British Board of
Trade showed itself anything but patriotic or business-
like when it declared the time was not ripe for legislative
inteiference. Most of the German ships have the Tele-
funken system installed ; and when it is a question of
travelling by a German ship with the Telefunken and a
British ship with nothing at all “nobody but a fool would
travel by the British ship.
THE SHAKSPERIAN REVIVAL.
Scene: Melbourne. Any day; any time.
That hardshell Tory, Frank Madden,
cropped up the other day in a semi-patriotic
character. He led a deputation of members of
t “® Historical Society to the Minister
u Education, and asked the Department to assist
the Society in collecting records of Victoria’s early
days. The idea is that the country State school
teacher—who is ill-paid and over-worked—shall
hunt up the local oldest inhabitant—who is
maundering and sometimes ill-tempered, and
often refuses to speak unless bribed with liquid
refreshment which the teacher can’t afford to
buy—and extract from him musty documents and
antique anecdotes. Then the teacher will send
the facts along to the Historical Society, writing
them out on his own paper and presumably
the postage himself.
“Sr” : Murray’s Government in Victoria
has handed over the control of the compassionate
allowance, so far as the suburbs are concerned, to
the “Ladies’ Benevolent Societies.” The com-
passionate allowance is a fund subsidiary to the
old-age pension, and is employed in helping needy
applicants who for some reason or other are not;
legally entitled to the pension. Witli few excep-
tions, these Ladies’ Benevolent Societies are
little cliques composed mainly of the doctor’s
“good lady,” the mayoress and the big
butcher’s vvife; and their qualifications
for disbursing public money are mostly a
blank. I do not mean to impeach their
honesty or their motives, but I do
know that their charity is often
prompted by favor and by influence.
They are elected by nobody, and
they owe responsibility to nobody ;
they simply choose their own asso-
ciates from the “influential ’’ ladies
of the district. But if anybody
will take a job off John Weary’s
hands, John isn’t prepared to ask
questions about qualifications or other foolish
things of that sort.
S. Aus. has had its first police-court case
under the new Registration of Barmaids Act. It
was rather a surprise, for the unregistered lady
merely sold a bottle of beer at a railway refresh-
ment room ; and the traveller by rail is much ,
more anxious about getting back to his seat‘ than
about the fascinations of the Hebe behind the
bar. He would buy just as much or as little beer
if she were a lubra or a Chow. But the caterer
had to pay £2 15s. all the same.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A cowardly assault was, late on Saturday night, per-
petrated on a man named Bruce Smith, at Circular Quay
and he was also robbed of 15s. in silver. Early on Satur-
day evening Bruce Smith met a wharf laborer, with whom
he wandered round the city, visiting several hotels,
where they regaled themselves with drinks. At a late
hour they found their way to Circular Quay, and when in
a secluded spot Bruce Smith’s acquaintance drew off and
punched him on the face, knocked him down, and it is
alleged took 15s. cash from his pocket, etc., etc.— Sydney

I see with stately step and slow
A thoughtful Empire Statesman go.
It is a Saturday, and he
Perambulates a city quay.
Eftsoons a person stops him flat
(One of the proletariat)
With “ Wotto 1 Cumanavadrink !”
I see the other pause and think,
Then round his ample form his cloak
Enwrap in silence. Straight the Bloke
(No other phrase expresses him),
His face with disappointment grim,
Demands of earth and sea and sky
The cause of such sobriety.
And fills the air with shouts of “Struth ! ”
“Gor-blimy,” and such cries of ruth,
Until, at length, the Statesman stops. ... .
Will he, I query, rail at hops
(Father and dam of Beer), and deal
A blow at Gin and Rum, which steal
Imbibers’ wits and wills awa.v ?
Just here I muchly grieve to say
The pub door swingeth open wide ;
Statesman and Bloke proceed inside.
The minutes pass. And now a sight
Obtrudes upon the peaceful night
Of shame and horror. They who went
Within, stone sober, reel forth pent
With alcohol. Beneath the moon
The twain a clumsy rigadoon
Perform before a gibing crowd.
The Statesman’s cloak, like some dark cloud,
Rises and falls. It flaps athwart
The visage, truculent and swart,
Of him whom I have termed the Bloke.
Rage fills the latter at the stroke :
He uttereth a frenzied cry,
And props the Statesmen in the eye.
Here all becomes a vague brown blur,
A medley wild, wherein a cur
Rolled on and kicked, leaps up with screams
Such as one only hears in dreams,
And tears the Statesman’s hosiery,
And bites the Bloke most cruelly.
Gore flows apace ; and teeth and hair
Are scattered in the evening air,
'Mid which the Bloke gets on the job,
And from the Statesman fifteen bob
Purloins the while he lies there dead
Unto the world, with fractured head.
And ever ’mid it all I brood,
And brood, and brood, yet do no good.
No satisfaction, no surcease
I gain, nor any soothing peace.
“ Bruce Smith ! ” I muse, “ It it were he 1
Bruce Smith ! Ah, no : it cannot be.
How then explain away the name?
Is any other called the same?
Yes ! Yes 1 ” I say : “ It must be so ! ”
And even now I do not know.

The least satisfactory thing that can be said about this
bank is that it isn’t Australian ; though it makes most of
its profits here, its directors and most of its shareholders
are on the other side. But it is a fine, solid bank all the
same ; and, according to all outward appearances, it has
made its position very much stronger during the past few
years. Take its premises account, for instance. At
February, IS94 —15 years ago—with £13,994,129 of ad-
vances on its books, including many overvalued ones
left over from the boom, its premises account stood at
£630,816. To-day, with £14,348,287 of advances, the
premises account is down to £572,457, in spite of
large building additions made meantime. In fact, the
amounts shown above as written off have, with few excep-
tions, been directed towards wiping out this item.
Probably it never will be wiped out altogether, and there
is no good reason why it should be ; for, though the Bank
of England has no premises account—or had none
recently—it has to be remembered that the Union and
other Australian banks don’t usually themselves occupy
the whole of their buildings, but derive large revenues by
letting off portions of them. Partly because of the severe
writing-down of these assets, and partly because it has
the use of just upon £8 of the public’s money for
every £1 of its own, the profits are still fine and
large. For last half-year they were at the rate of
£9 14s. 6d. percent, per annum on capital and reserves
combined. A few terms ago they were much higher ;
but that, no doubt, was because the bank was seizing
the chance of high prices to quit pastoral securities at
considerably more than their written-down values.
Comparing the balance-sheet figures with those
of 12 months ago, these results show up :
Feb., 1908. Feb., 1909.

Deposits have, it seems, been harder to get; but, on the
other hand, advances have been called in, or at any rate
have come in, so that 45 per cent, of all liabilities are
still held in liquid form—a very strong position indeed.

This co. was formed in 1889 to take over the fire, marine,
and guarantee business of toe old Victoria Life and
General Co. when the latter decided to go out of active
business and wait patiently till the last life-policy holder
should be certified to be well and truly dead. It is, how-
ever, worked from the same office as the Victoria Insur-
ance Co., which does a fire and marine business ; so
apparently this co. doesn’t worry much about those lines.
Its reserves are small, and because of the big dividends
the additions to the reserves are wretched ; still as long
as the co. is mainly a guarantee office, it isn’t likely to be
struck by a ’Frisco disaster or anything of that sort such
as haunts the dreams of the fire-insurance manager.
Probably' on account of the keener competition of
the big offices for the side-lines of insurance, this co.’s
premium income is steadily shrinking, while its expenses

The first column in that comparison is pretty cheerless ,
and it seems likely that some day—after the Victoria
Life Co. has paid its last claim—the Victoria Insurance
Co. will swallow up this business, so that there will be
only one brass place to keep polished instead of three.
The assets are mostly deposits and Board of Works
debentures, along with £11,237 of real estate.

This co. has lately got in £50,000 more capital; but as
the transaction only happened on July 1 the present
accounts don’t show it. For many years the amount
paid up was £190,000 ; then a further £60,000 was got in ;
now £50,000 more. The 100,000 shares are paid to £3,
and they are still liable for another £7. This is the first
time that the old original shareholders have had the
chance to pay up something. The present co. was
formed in 1888 to take over Elder’s Wool and Produce
Co., which consisted of 20,000 £lO shares paid to £2 10s.
The new co. issued 80,000 more shares, and up to now it
has been these last that have had the benefit of the call-
ing-up of capital. All, however, are now paid to the
same amount. The increase of capital in hand has been
characteristic of a very prudent management; for as the
next comparison shows, there has been a heavy increase
in liabilities: —

The present co. paid £40,856 for goodwill; but all that
has long since been written off. Land, premises and
plant have in all cost £133,858 ; and £54,603 has been
written off that, too. From these things it can
be pretty safely assumed that the disclosed re-
serves are sound, which is another way of say-
ing that the profits are really as much as the direc-
tors say they are. And they are very handsome indeed ;
last year capital and reserves combined earned £l2 11s.
per cent. net. No doubt there are risks ahead. The co.
finances people in a very uncertain line of business ; and
the magnificent S. Australian wool and wheat results of
the past five years certainly won’t go on for ever. That
fact is, however, apparently forgotten by some people who
are buyfng land and leases in S. Australia and elsewhere.
Farmingland in particular has been boomed outrageously.
The trouble is that, when you fall back on figures and
show that such prices were never paid before, and that on
past yields and wheat values disaster must follow, you are
countered with the remark that past records don’t apply
now that new systems of farming have been introduced.
And so the boom goes on, and isn’t recognised as a boom—
which makes it the more dangerous. To what extent
this co. is feeding it one can’t, of course, tell; but it is
clear that advances have increased enormously during the
past few years. The quality of the management will only
be seen when, later on, the pendulum swings to the other
side of the clock. Nevertheless, as said just now, there
are good reasons to expect that the management of this
co. will come through very well.

It will be noticed that the first column wears a large and
bloated look by comparison with the rest. The truth is
that up to IS9B (inclusive) the directors wouldn’t face the
trouble in which Queensland’s wild borrowing boom had
landed them six years before. For years the story was,
“Oh, it’s merely a temporary check —things will recover
presently.” When, however, it became quite clear that
they wouldn’t do anything of the sort, the directors took
out their little hatchet, cut the capital in halves, and, as
far as it would go, used one of the halves to fill up the
hole caused by the shrinkage in property values. There
had been 150,000 shares of 255.; these were written down
to 12s. 6d., of which ss. was unpaid on most of the shares.
Since then 2s. 6d. has been called up, and now, with a few
exceptions, the shares are paid to 10s. The trouble at
present is to say whether a fair thing is being written off
profits to provide for depreciation of plant and premises.
Assuming, however, that a fair thing is being done in
that respect, then a very comfortable margin of profit is
now left after paying the dividend ; and investors are
entitled to take a note of the gradual increase of that
margin, which in ordinary circumstances might be taken
as a hint of something in store. At the same time, in
view of the heavy liabilities, and because Queensland is a
State of such violent ups and downs, the reserves need to
be made much stronger yet, and a tight rein should be
kept on the dividends.

In effect the co. declares a bonus of Is. per share in addi-
tion to the 10 per cent, dividend, but applies it to paying
up the shares from 11s. to 125., leaving Bs. still uncalled.
Practically, therefore, the total div. amounts to a little
over 19 per cent, for the year. The co. put itself into a
splendid position to make money during the present
burst of prosperity in the pastoral business. When it
fell into the usual trouble during the boom of the early
’nineties—it was born in 1888—it established a self-deny-
ing ordinance and paid no dividends for many years.
Every penny it made it applied to the reduction of debt
on the one side of its balance-sheet, and the reduction of
its goodwill and other assets on the other side. But this
shows the proceedings in precise figures :

'As it got out of its old pastoral advances and realised the
properties that had been thrown on its hands, the co. set
harder to work on its agency business ; and in the past
12 months it has so.ld close-up one-fourth of all the fat
sheep put through at the Flemirigton (Sydney) saleyards,
and more than one-fourth of the cattle. This, and
the erection of big head-office premises in the city,
account for the spring in freeholds, and also for the
pretty considerable growth of liabilities. The future of
this class of co. must always be more or less uncertain ;
apart from the great variations in the quantity of stock,
etc., offering, there is always the risk of a severe slump in
pastoral securities. Certainly the advances, etc., are com-
paratively small at present; bun it is not always so easy
to hold the profitable agency business and keep the ad-
vances small as it has been in these late good times. Still
there is this to be said: it is clear that the co. hasn’t
financed many people into holdings at the recent high
prices, and if you don’t get it in at the top floor Vou haven’t
got so far to fall even if things do go wrong. So for a
pastoral finance and agency co. this co.’s risks at present
look distinctly smaller than the average.

Thk Bulletin has no authority to excommunicate any-
body who won’t accept all the foregoing as the literal
truth. It is perfectly obvious, in fact, that some of the
figures don’t deserve to be accepted. Just now, for
instance, a revaluation has been made of the assets, and
£16,724 has to be written off. Of this, apparently, £4762
comes off the goodwill and £11,962 off the plant,
machinery, etc. This means that £11,962 which ought
hitherto to have been written off revenue wasn’t written
off ; consequently the profits (when there were any) were
inflated, and at other times bigger losses were made than
the accounts showed. There was, however, no way for
the shareholders to check these practices while they were
in progress, because the amount provided for deprecia-
tion was very rarely mentioned. The shareholders
originally put up £40,000; and of this something over
£lB,OOO, spent in establishing the paper, was subse-
quently transferred to goodwill account. By degrees
that item was built up to £24,762—the more the co. lost
the more it was alleged to be worth as a going concern.
In 1898 a dividend of 8 per cent, was paid ; and, later on,
there were other dividends. No more than 4 per cent,
ought ever to have been paid ; the rest should all have
been put by for replacements. As it wasn’t, and
as there was nothing' to buy new plant with, an effort was
made to run the concern with worn-out machinery ; and
of course the results were disastrous. When a crisis was
reached it was decided to issue 12,500 pref. shares, hold-
ing 2500 in reserve. But the crisis was worse than had
been thought. You can’t starve a man for years, and
then expect him to compete with others straight off even
if you do start to feed him. So the £12,500 went, and
now there are £16,079 of debentures and £4121 of other
debts as well—in all £32,700 of creditors ahead of the
original shareholders. And against that £32,700 there
are—Plant, etc., £23,200 ; book debts, £5052 ; stocks and
cash, £1964; total, £30,216. Beyond that there is
nothing- except goodwill—in a business which last year
lost £6179 after being in existence 22 years. It isn’t
a cheerful prospect for the old shareholders. Disregard-
ing goodwill, all their money has gone and some of the
pref. capital as well. And yet there ought to be a big
future for the Star, which, moreover, has been a better
paper these last few months than it had been for many a
year previously. In fact, it has suddenly become the
ablest and brightest daily in N.S.W. But it has such a
lot of leeway to make up that a good deal more capital
may have to be put into it yet; and Heaven only knows
who will own it in the end.

For many years this co. had only an issue of ordinary
shares. 1n’1907, however, it struck trouble in the shape
of a fire at ics city warehouse ; and it then set to work to
provide something more elaborate. Apparently it hadn’t
gone very far b fore what Maoriland always speaks nicely
of as “ the financial stringency ” began to show its ugly
head ; and then an issue of preference shares was decided
on. For a while they were offered only to existing share-
holders ; then, as so many of these had their own troubles,
the public was invited to come in after September last.
But as the public has troubles of its own, too, the
response hasn’t been overwhelming. This shows how the
capital and other items have moved ;

It seems a rather poor time to make such big additions to
buildings, plant, etc., especially as the co. has had to do
so much of it on borrowed money, which is likely to be
expensive in Maoriland during the next few years. Still
Kaiapoi has a good name : and if the co. is sufficiently
protected against cheap foreign shoddy, especially at a
time when Maoriland won’t have too much loose silver in
its pockets, things should come out all right in the end.
But the amount put to reserve is perilously small; and in
view of the co.’s need of capital and of Maoriland’s gloomy
outlook until it has got over its recent financial drunk,
the year’s div. might well have been cut down a trifle.

This co. moves on very conservative lines. Its published
Profit and Loss account is a mere shadowy skeleton ; the
profits are shown “after making deductions for de-
preciation, insurance,” and other items. It never men-
tions what those deductions amount to. From the
comparison printed below it seems, however, that
during the past six months £2200 was written off ship
property

This co. was formed in 1891. At the end of 1892 its ship
property stood at £72,085. Right down to 1906 it kept
going practically by patching its old fleet. By the
end of 1904, as shown above, the £72,085 had been
written down to £41,300; and the amount thus
written off—over £3o,ooo—had been accumulated,
mostly in cash. At the end of 1892 the co had
cash in bank, less outstanding debts, £1984; but
it also had freeholds and leaseholds valued at £22,248.
By the end of 1904, or 12 years later, the liquid assets in
excess of debts were £60,58S ; but of that something
under £15,000 had been derived from sales of freeholds.
In 1906 the co. began to put the saved-up money into
ships: it is riskier there, but it certainly ought under
ordinary circumstances to earn a lot better interest. So
far, however, the disclosed results haven’t been gaudy ;
still, as before mentioned, one never knows how much
profit the co. is writing off for depreciation, though on
past records it is safe to say that it is something very
substantial. The co. has a tough competitor in the rail-
ways, which offer special terms to people at the back of
Newcastle to consign their stuff through to Sydney. Fur-
ther, much of the best country which Newcastle ought to
serve is in the hands of big people who don’t put it to the
fullest use ; and though in many cases they are now pre-
pared to go out, it is only at a price which will mean a
long and desperate struggle for the smaller men who may
go in.

This co. was formed in April, 1908, to take over Kozmin-
sky’s Austral Hat Mills. The transfer was made as from
July, 1907 ; but profits for the first year, after paying
dividends for the period April-June, were to be put to
reserves. The vendor took 5000 ordinary shares ; the
public took 17,000 7 per cent, cumulative pref. shares.
After the latter get their 7 per cent, the ordinaries talce
10 per cent ; after that attain all rank alike for dividends.
For the first half of the past year ordinaries g*>t
a dividend at the rate of 7 per cent, per annum ; but
only the pref. issue get a bite in the second half. 0° ,,,e
new arrangements have been made at the mill recently',
and these, it is said, are now giving better results ; but
as the figures stand they are disappointing. The amount
written off is equal to about 5 per cent, on premises, ana
a verv moderate S£ per cent, on machinery and Pj ant -
Twelve months ago cash balances, less liabilities,
amounted to £3167; now liabilities exceed cash balances
by £960. This somersault is due to the purchase of new
plant and an increase in stock and book debts, the latter
moving from £1957 to £3063. The eo. hasn’t made a very
good start; but it is too early yet to say what it is
capable of doing.

That is one wav of putting it, though it isn’t the only
way. As at December, 1906, £26,250 of the capital—one-
fourth—was returned, the co. having only a time bargain
with the Cit.v Council. For the first year the assets were
not, however, formally written down to correspond, but
the £26,250 still appeared as a “Buildings, plant, etc.,
extinguishment account.” In the present accounts not
only is this £26,250 written off, but £20,056 besides, made
up as follows :
Reserve for depreciation and renewals .. £11,896
Special reserve 1,500
Sinking fund (portion) .. .. .. 6,660-
Total ; ... £20,056
In the foregoing table, however, the sinking fund, which
is invested in debentures, is not regarded as written off.
There has been a considerable shrinkage in profits ; but
this is partly due to the repa.yment of capital, and the
loss of interest on investments—a loss, that is, so far as
the co. is concerned. The actual gross revenue from the
undertaking, and the working expenses (including
management,), are shown next: —

1908 .. 20.358 9006 11,352
1909 .. 19,771 9041 10,730
So the shrinkage in net profits isn’t due en-
tirely to the loss of interest on investments ;
for "income is getting gradually less, in spite of
the fact that between 1900 and 1909 £13,269 of capital
had been spent on the works, plant, etc., while there is
also a natural growth in working expenses. In Mel-
bourne, as elsewhere, electricity is u keen competitor
with this class of business ; and if this form of power as
applied to lifts, etc., is holding its own, it is clear enough
that the profits from it are not.

It was such a change that there was actually some busi-
ness in the shares on the Sydney Stock Exchange. But,
as might perhaps be guessed, it wasn’t an ordinary sale
which returned this profit to the co., but a municipal
resumption—for vegetable market purposes, apparently.
Still things have looked up considerably, and “ the com-
pany's properties are all let at the present time with the
exception of one house (only just vacant) at Double Bay
and four small offices in Bond-street, Sydney.” Further,
three properties have been sold, though too late co affect
the present accounts. As at June, 1899—ten years ago—
the property account stood at £282,998 ; rents totalled
£10,537. On the average of the property holding (book
value) for that year the gross rent return was £3 14s-. per
cent. For the past year it was £4 ss, 2d. per cenfc apart
from the interest received on account of the resumption
mentioned above. That is a solid improvement of over
£ per cent. Yet, in order to pay interest and the co.’s
very moderate expenses and leave 5 per cent, on capital,
the gross rent return would have to sail up from £11,448
to £17,055. The position in other respects has moved as
follows:
1899. 1907. 1908. 1909.
Capital paid £142,422 £160,648 £160,648 £160,64S
Liabilities .. 151,434 126,654 125,471 120,299
Properties . 282,998 269,533 269,533 268,483
Other assets V 2,497 1,763 1,399 2,201
There is, of course, no telling how long the improvement
is going to last. Sydney is, however, making such re-
markable strides under Federation and Protection that it
seems highly probable that the worst of the co.’s troubles
are behind "it. In 1902, when Richardson and Wrench,
♦Ltd.,valued the assets, they were putdown ataprice which
would pay off the debt and leave only £46,000 of capital
out of the" total of £145,000 then paid up. Even on £46,000,
the much improved working profit for the year (apart
from profit on sales) was only equal to 5 per cent. ; on
the full £160,648, it was only equal to 1£ per cent. Still,
that return must not be taken as a basis of valuation,
because no doubt some of the assets are unproductive
land. Unfortunately the interest on the big mortgage
debt, averaging about £4 14s. per cent., has to be paid
whether the pledged property is productive or not; and
that has made the co.’s struggle such a long, uphill one.
In the past 10 years, in fact, after paying interest and
expenses, the co. has only had £3763 left over from the
revenue from all its properties.

This eo. was formed in 1888 to take over Aarons’ Ex-
change Hotel; and, though the lease had only 12 years
to run, no less than £15,000 was given for goodwill out of
the paid capital of £17,500. (There were 35,000 shares of
15s. each, paid to 10s.) In 1900 another lease for 10 years
was secured ; and now a third has been got for 20 years.
But to secure the last renewal £5063 has been paid as
“bonus for new lease and charges in connection there-
with,” the bulk of the charge being the cost of putting
two storeys on to the building. In the foregoing table all
this has been treated as goodwill and not reckoned as an
asset. To raise money Is. per share had been called up as
at June 30, and a bank creditof £2046 had been turned into
an overdraft of £1303. For some years past the business
has made a poor show so far as dividends are concerned,
mainly because so much of the capital has been repre-
sented by nothing but paper ; and it was understood
some time ago that the directors proposed to write
off capital in order to make things look more reasonable.
Nothing, however, has yet been done. Probably on
account of the alterations lately in progress, the past
half-year’s figures are not a fair guide to wtiat the co.
will do under normal conditions presently.

This co., formed 31 years ago, has hitherto been working
an area of about 2500 acres of leasehold, partly under the
ocean. Like most other Newcastle cos., it established no
sinking or amortization fund; it went along cheerfully
on the assumption that you can burn your coal and have
it too. Later on, when it found out that you can’t, it
had very little available coal and nothing to buy another
mine with. Still, by keeping down its dividends during
the last few years, it has managed to secure a new free-
hold property—the Whitburn, of 546 acres—and trial
shipments of coal were recently made with satisfactory'
results. Part of the plant at the old mine has
been shifted to the new one, and more is now
being transferred—which disturbance will probably
make the current half-year’s profits look pretty sick.
Considering the heavy expenses that the co. has recently
had to bear, including £13,650 for the Whitburn freehold,
the financial position is pretty good ; the total liabilities
are £9250, and on the other side liquid assets (apart from
stores) are set down at £11,529. The capital is in 10,000
shares of £ll each, paid to £lO.

As chairman E. A Govett told the shareholders
in London the other day', it was a good thing for the
Broken Hill South Blocks that it had the Lake View
Consols to lean against, otherwise it would certainly have
been obliged to reconstruct. Twelve months ago there
was still about £lO,OOO to pay off; and, said the chair-
man, “it was not till about the beginning of this year
that we were in a position to say' that our profits had
overtaken the expenditure, that we were clear of debt,
that future profits would be available for other purposes,
and that we were able at last to close our capital account.”
Govett’sestimatesare probably' the best put forward by'any
mining co. chairman interested in a big way in Australia ;
and his idea is that, with lead at £l3 per ton, and work-
ing costs (including development) at 165., there should
be a monthly profit of £2200 on an output of 10,000 tons
a month. A move of £1 in the lead market either way
means £l3OO a month to the co.
* * * *
Sutherland and Cameron, the machinery people,
who took over the whole Mitchell Creek (N.S. W.) outfit
from the former representative of James Dick, passed the
tailings and mine on to Savage and Ashcroft ; and a
Sydney syndicate has been formed to handle the pur-
chase. They ought at the price to make £lO,OOO out of
the tailings heap ; but if they tackle the mine they will
most likely drop the lot. Thomas Pascoe, late super-
intendent of Boppy gold mine, was one of several who
thoroughly overhauled the show, and reported that
there wasn’t a pound of profit in it.
* * * •
The English people who have been giving
Major’s Creek (N.S.W.) another trial have decided that it
isn’t good enough to go on with. It is a big and uncertain
impregnation, and if worked at all would have to be
worked in way with extensive and costly machinery'.
The size of New Hillgrove Prop.’s catastrophe
can be summed up from the fact that 1000 shares were
quitted the other day in Sydney at 2d. ; and holders,
remembering the first and second debentures, rushed the
buyer with offers of more at the same price.
* * * *
Baker’s Creek (N.S.W.) is still doing some
stoping' over No. 18 level. Values have fallen off below
this level; and prospects in the winze at a depth of 51ft.
are anything but good. The winze is following the foot-
wall vein, while No. 19 level is being driven on the hang-
ing-wall vein of Smith’s reef. The latter has been driven
227 ft. from the crosscut, and prospects have been very
poor, though in the last 30ft. things have been better ; so
there is still hope that some payable ground may’ be
found in this level.

Boulder No. 1 (W.A.) is still in trouble. Since
January last its Magnet mine has crushed at a loss of
£3509 ; and, although “better results” have been hourly
expected, they haven’t come along up to now. The co.
must be getting hard pushed for cash, and only an early
turn-up can save shareholders from being buttonholed for
more. The root of the co.’s misfortune- is unsuitable
plant and unpayable ore ; and when these two worries are
joined together, want of breath is generally close handv.
The demise of the Magnet property, however, would still
leave the co. with the Kalgoorlie lease ; and as the latter’s
speculative value is increasing every dav, shareholders
will—if the worst happens—have something to console
them in their sad bereavement.
Great Boulder (W. A.) has reached 2500 ft., and
stabbed the lode in two places with a drill. As usual,
the ore met with opposite the main shaft was poor
and narrow; but 600 ft. south, in a line with Edwards’
shaft, Hft. of solid quartz, assaying lOJdwt., was struck.
In most of the higher levels, and certainly at every level
below 1300 ft., the best part of the shoot lies south of the
main shaft and extends some distance beyond Edwards’
shaft. The lode was only fair to middling opposite these
two points at 2350 ft., but improved in driving. As the
best deep-ground values have been associated with ore
bodies of the character just cut by the drill from
Edwards’ shaft, the development is locally regarded as a
satisfactory one.
* * * *
With nearly 2f millions sterling in sight, 33ft.
of 555. ore at 1970 ft., and the best shoot at Kalgoorlie run-
ning through its property, the Ivanhoe is a risk that
ought to make an insurance canvasser's teeth water. To
date the co. has torn 5J million pounds’ worth of gold out
of the ground. About~£2,3oo,ooo of this has been paid in
dividends, and seeing that the profit in sight now runs
out at something over £5 per share, and that a big width
of ore of higher grade than that now sent to the mill is
exposed in the bottom workings, the shareholders’ pud-
ding seems to be as full of plums as ever.
* 9 * *
Sons of Gwalia (W. A.) is not going to pay 4s.
a year just yet. In a circular which came out by the last
mail, the Board states that the increased output will
enable the annual dividend to be raised from 3s. to 3s. 6d.,
which sum the directors propose to pay 9d. one quarter
and Is. the next. As this paper has previously said, the
mine is well able to pay the 4s. ; but the directors are
evidently too weary to attempt any further work for the
time being.
» * * *
The drill has stabbed the lode at 400 ft. in the
Gwalia Consolidated (YV. A.), and shares have had arise.
Of the first 40ft. of core the early assays were 265. per
ton ; but better results than this are expected. This
show is among the bigg st lode propositions in the coun-
try ; in fact, its harrackers allege that over £250,000 has
been dug out down to 100 ft. In the absence of any evi-
dence to the contrary, The Bulletin doesn’t dispute this
statement, but it can’t help wondering where all this
wealth has gone, and what has become of the several hun-
dreds of thousands of hard cash which have been raised
from time to time to keep the bailiffs at arm’s length.
Under the auspices of Hooper, Speak and Williams, the
mine now has an opportunity to vindicate its existence,
and it shouldn’t be long about it.
• * * *
As shareholders have turned up their noses at
the preference-share scheme, the Coolgardie Redemption
(W. A.) is thinking of going into liquidation—a sanctuary
which, in view of its back-breaking indebtedness and its
doubtful prospects, it should have sought long ago.
Greenmount (W.A.) is making a bold bid for
wealth. The co. is controlled by a Perth crowd, and
has three shows at Southern Cross. One property, from
which the co. derives its name, has just about paid ex-
penses down to 180 ft. Another, called Donovan’s Find,
which was acquired last October, recently crushed 1800
tons of £6 ore from the 180 ft. level, and is said to have
even better stuff at 60ft. below this depth. The third,
known as Macauley’s, is alleged to have mostly £5 stone.
Provided no lies are being told about the last-named
mines, shareholders ought to get a look in before long.
• • * »
London and Western Australian Exploration,
Ltd., has passed out and willed its assets and liabilities to
the London, Australian and General Exploration, Ltd.
Probably the latterwill now look to West Africa.
New Reefers Go., Kalgoorlie (W. A.), has aroused
local ire for passing ore worth a dwt. or so through the
mill. Mine authorities excuse themselves for the waste
of money by alleging that the lode does not lend itself to
sampling ; but it does seem the acme of foolishness to go
so utterly on the blind and treat such poverty-stricken
ore. There isn’t much science or method about such a
primitive system of working.
If any of the deep sinkers strike a good reef
Charters Towers will have another revival. New Brilliant
Freehold is to sink the main shaft another lift; and as
the country is favorable, there may be a development of
some consequence. The last crushing of 525 tons returned
£2541; and the co. has now about three times that much
in hand. Brilliant Black is approaching a depth of
2000 ft., and the high price of shares shows the local faith
in the future of the Day Dawn deep levels.
4 * ■*
Charters Towers has been easing off again in the
favor of the sharemarket. Mills’ United is s,ill the
biggest div.-payer, with £30,000 for the half-year, and
another one is coming. Bonnie Dundee has declared-
another sixpenny, but the market wants to see some im-
provement in the mine. Brilliant Extended has not been
crushing so well, though this may be only a temporary
trouble. It has the biggest monthly tonnage on the field,
and reserves keep at about 70,000 tons. The sinking of
the underlay below No. 18 and the opening'of another
level attract most attention. The last monthly return
was 4530 tons for £9190. Brilliant Deep crushed 340 tons
for £1675, but profits will have to go into development
work for some time to come. This mine adjoins the
Brilliant Extended, but the workings of the two are a
long way apart. A notable event has been the liquida-
tion dividend of the old Day Dawn Block and Wyndham
—2s. per share (£49,840). It has been a splendid pro-
perty, and has paid a total of over £700,000, the big end
of which has gone to J. Bull.
* ■* ■* *
Mungaria (Q.) is now working under a better
contract with Chillagoe; so, bar accidents, the profits
should show considerable improvement. During July
2783 tons w'ere sampled, and the gross yield was 144 tons
copper, 278 tons lead, and 26,4430 z. silver, valued approxi-
mately at £14,000. It is a big yield ; yet the net return
to the Mungana Co. was only £5797. That means some-
thing over £3 per ton of ore for smelting - , refining and
realisation alone. The Girofla mine is doing well, but ore
reserves there are restricted, so the Dorothy is to be
tried. The Lady Jane doesn’t seem likely to be a large
producer again for some time to come.
•* * * *
The work done at Mount Elliott, Cloncurry
(Q.), in July will take some beating. The one small fur-
nace smelted close upon 3000 tons of ore, and the matte
w - as treated in one converter stand ; size of shell, 6ft. x
Bft. The product was 457 tons blister copper. Thisinust
be close up to a world’s record for this size of converter
vessel for a month’s work. The management has made a
start dismantling the old plant, and plans have been got
out for the new' one. Underground, the plat at the 400 ft.
level is being enlarged prior to further sinking the main
shaft, and other development work is in progress. The
Hampden is putting in a new boiler, and is pumping
No. 3 shaft with three shifts ; and at the co.’s Duchess
mine they are still driving on ore 10 p.c. to 35 p.e. copper,
running from sft. to 12ft. wide. The ore is mostly glance.
+ ■* * *
Great Northern Extended Consols, Rutherglen
(Vic.), has awakened from its sleep. Under Frank Rab-
ling it is going to do great things for shareholders.
Happy shareholders, still happier Rabiing, and still
happier State Government which, is to produce ■
all this joy bv an advance of £5OO. If position
speaks volumes, the G. N. Extended Consols ought to be
“bonser.” On both sides are decent mines, and it was for
years looked at as the plum in the pudding. But £183,000
has drifted into that lead without any at all trickling into
shareholders’ poqkets. Now a doubt is raised w’hether the
real gutter is not farther west. If so this explains why
G. N. Extended Consols has failed. Rabiing - succeeds
Visick, who has gone to the Great Southern Consols, and
the Board includes some of the pluckiest alluvial men in
the State. Their presence is the best sign that there is a
fair mining chance in the show itself.
* « * *
Two of the Age Symes have gone on the Board
of the New Bethanga (Vic.). Dead David Syme was
induced to put cash into the show years back by J. A.
Wallace. Then J. Bull joined the pair, and nothing came
out of it save debt and liquidation. Victorians
then again took command, and brought in Edwards, of
Ballarat, to furnish furnace skill. This he is doing to
some purpose ; but it is early days yet to talk. There
have been furnaces and furnaces, chlorination on chlorina-
tion, and almost every device that the metallurgist can
devise at Bethanga ; but everything has boiled down to
a loss. J. A. Wallace years back admitted to having
dropped £60,000 of his own, but he always had faith that
he would win it back some day. Like David Syme, he is
in his resting-place, and new men are trying new methods.
But when they get the method they have to open up the
mines ; and as to what will happen then, it would have
been well if the new manager had spoken more uncon-

Champion, Ten Mile (Vic.), is the last but not
the least of the fledglings that were hatched out during
the Star of the West boom three years ago. Now
Champion is on to the div. list, and the Board, being
sanguine, “ has every confidence of being able to continue
dividend paying.” Profits come out of 12dwt. dirt, and
are made possible by cheap tunnel working. But one
or two divs. up Ten Wile way don’t mean much. What
has yet to be proved there is a shoot of gold of decent
length. The Star of the West fizzle all arose out of the
gold cutting out like the light from a policeman's bull’s-
eye. The old Champion shoots, even in that mine’s best
days, hadn’t a much better record; but the new
Champion shoots, having taken three years to develop,
may have expanded a bit in the meantime.

Llanberris No. 1 deserves the latter part of its
name, for it came out about the time that Noah’s Ark
alighted at Ballarat East. If it has not developed into
anything more than the usual Ballarat East mine, that
is the fault of the system, and not of the reefs or the
workers. The disparity between capital put up and gold
won shows that. The capital was £25,600 ; gold and
pyrites tot up to within a shade of £300,000. Yet divs.
have been only £34,000, or about 9s. per £4 of gold
won ; and that is exclusive of cash put in by share-
holders. If that capital be deducted, the net return is
only £B5OO. For an oldster that has had the chances
of Llanberris No. 1 this is a miserable record.
Traced to first causes, the fault lies with the
readiness with which any little profit has gone out in
dividends; next it lies with the unreadiness of the share-
holders to put up capital for progressive development
work, the miserable scale on which the mine is worked
(about 20,000 tons a year), and, last of all, the wretched
contract system called tributirig. It is a mere subterfuge
to save the shareholder from paying calls. Cos. in Balla-
rat adopt it because the people of Ballarat won’t back
their own field. Yet they look glum when they see
Lydiard-street becoming more and more deserted, owing
to the gradual decline of the working population of the
place.

YVandiligong, one of the Bright (Vic.) dredges,
which started in 1905, has now paid £9210 in divs. on a
capital of £5400 (at the start it was only £3600). The
past half-year’s divs. were £l5OO, and the bank credit was
also brought up from £552 to £1022. The early months
gave poor results from both dredges, but things have
improved lately. Up to now 76£ acres in all have been
eaten up, leaving 233 J yet to work. How the rest will turn
out nobody knows for certain, because not a bit of this co.’s
ground has been bored ; but there is no reason why the
middle shouldn’t be as good as the ends at which the
dredges have been working so far.

Lyell Blocks (Tas.) has fired a red-hot shot
into the Bowes Kelly-Jamieson-Mt. Lyell camp. The
bullet has heen heated by Jamieson’s pal, Colin Temple-
ton, who is ever ready to nip into a neat deal, and it is
aimed at the North Lyell mine. Down to the 850 ft. level
the shoots of ore went down vertically, but in the last
250 ft. they have made to the east rather sharply. Lyell
Blocks are next door in that direction, and their owners
hope that Mount Lyell’s loss will be their gain.
In this spirit they wanted to have a look over
the North Lyell and workings. Whereupon Sec-
retary Mellor* conveniently motored into retire-
ment down at the Footscray manure works, while
Sticht went to the Adelaide branch of the same works.
So Colin Templeton’s nominee, Bob Ferguson, didn’t get
the desired order. But he has bustled through the Lyell
plans, and he now tells the world that the easterly Lyell
ore shoot will pitch into the Blocks at 120Dft. Seeing that
Lyell is down to 1100 ft. and is poking away to the east
without getting the ore body, it seems as if Ferguson has
a bit of weight on his side. There is an alternative which
Stock Exchange bears chortle over. It is that the
ore may have cut out altogether. Anyhow, never
a speck of ore has yet been cut towards the
east at 1100 ft., though the Lyell wants every lb.
of ore reserve it can find. Templeton thinks the Blocks’
chance is good enough to justify the spending of from
£7OOO to £lO,OOO in shaft-sinking on the North Lyell
boundary'. Then, we are to see what we will see.

After making a valiant effort to prop up their
Tongkah market the Tasmanians found the weight too
heavy, and let it go early this week. Probably it is the
best thing that could happen to the co. ; for while shares
stand up the bulk of the holders won’t believe there’s
anything the matter. And in this case delays are very
dangerous; they' may imperil the whole business.
Managing-Director Miles has vigorously attacked Free-
man’s report in which he warned the co. that the dock
and channel work is a very serious undertaking. Free-
man admitted that he wasn’t a harbor engineer; hut it
doesn’t take a harbor engineer to tell that y'on can’t
easily build a high wall of silt. And some of it looks like
silt. And A. H. Ashbolt, one of the directors, long before
this que-tion was raised, said : “ While I was at Tongkah
the ground dredged was particularly easy to work, no
boulders or rocks of any' description, and the pipeclay
of a very' friable nature, so that it ran quite free....
To me it seemed no harder to dredge than dredging
out the silt from the Hobart Rivulet.” Also E. A.
Peacock, another director, reported early in the day that
in boring they lost the coarser tin “ through the inability
of the augers and sand pump to bring it up through the
soft wet slush of the drift through which the bores were
put.” As there is therefore good evidence apart from
Freeman that the harbor bottom is composed partly at
least of stuff with which you can’t build walls, the
co. ought to lose no time in getting a report
from a harbor engineer. Probably the best man
in Australia for the job is Cullen, of Brisbane ; and the
chances are that, for the sake of the extra experience he
would get, the Department would give him the necessary'
leave to go to Puket and make a report. Then at least
the ,co. would know definitely how it stands—whether
the work it has undertaken to do is a mere nothing (as
Miles says) or whether it is (as Freeman suggests) a
matter perhaps of hundreds of thousands.
Siam and the country thereabouts are evidently
going to have a tin-dredging boom. Up to now Chinese
have worked much of the ground ; but even the China-
man with his shovel and dish can’t make a living out of
stuff going only a few pence per cub. yard. So the
dredging engineer has come along, and he finds most of
the conditions almost ideal. Cecil Rae, acting for the
Malay Tin Dredging Proprietary (Melb.), has secured a
concession in Perak ; and James, of 8., M. and Co.’s staff,
has come to terms on behalf of the Straits Concessions,
Ltd., concerning an area in Kedah, which is in the
Federated Malay States, and adjoining Siam. James,
who was formerly manager at Great Fitzroy (Q.), is now
at the Bnrmah Mines, and is filling in four months’ leave
looking into the merits of various properties in those
parts. The Straits Concessions, Ltd., is largely com-
posed of 8., M. and Co.’s following, and has its office in
Adelaide.

In the calculation of working costs in concen-
trating mills and workshops, ever}’ small item should be
taken into consideration. It is the small and uncon-
sidered factors, involving waste of power, that make for
high working costs. The type of bearing employed has a
marked effect on the power consumed in overcoming
friction. Recent exhaustive tests emphasised the marked
superiority of the Hyatt Flexible Roller Bearings over all
other types of roller, sleeve, and other anti-friction
bearings. Under equal conditions the loss of power due
to friction in Hyatt Flexibles is 23 per cent, less than
with the best solid roller bearing, and 65 per cent, less
that with babbit metal journals. Messrs. W. and J.
Lempriere, 506 Little Collins Street,'Melbourne, will be
glad to supply further information to those interested.*

“One fine day, then, we start at early dawn by

picture more definite, let ns take, by preference, a motor

the top of a descent, on the right or on the left, seizing
the brake, the wheel, the steering-handle, unexpectedly
barring all space, assuming the deceptive appearance of a

The Callow Revolving Band Screen gives
promise of revolutionising the system of ore classification
in Australia, as it has already done in America, for all
classes and conditions of concentrating ores, with vastly
improved extraction in the mills. At Broken Hill it has
been especially successful. It is an unqualified success as a
line wet screen, and this is what all the mining world has
been seeking; it is also equally effective on the coarse rafts
from Cornish Rolls. With it there is no excessive wear, no
clogging of the mesh; it has an enormous capacity and a
small water consumption. The fundamental principle of
this machine is a travelling band or belt of screen cloth
stretched on a drum over which the ore and its carrying
water is spread by means of a distributing apron of
special design. The drum passes over rollers, and the
belt is caused to revolve continuously at a speed adapted
to the nature and quantity of the material to be screened.
The machine is fully protected by patent rights. For
further particulars apply to the Austral Otis Engineering
Co., of Hanna Street, South Melbourne. This firm are the

Brisbane, consisting of a 300-horse-power Compound Jet
Condensing Robey Engine, with a Babcock and Wilcox
Water-tube Boiler fitted with Chain Grate Stoker and

less than 1 Jib. per horse-power per hour. We believe
that these actual results establish a record for economy

teHs how it took 12 camels to pull a three-ton
load. VVell, the camel wouldn’t be here to stay in
Westraha if he couldn’t do better than that. A

lie streets with many names
(B. 5/8/'O9). Elizabeth-street, which starts, or
finishes, according to the way you look at it, at
the big tower on Tait’s new Melbourne station, is
called Elizabeth till it reaches the Haymarket.
Then it changes to Fleniington-road or to Sydney-
road. Flemington-road is renamed Mount
Alexander-road when it gets to Flemington.
Then after Essendon is passed it is called Keilor-
road. After it gives Keilor the go-by it is re-
named Mount Alexander-road, and this title
sticks to it till Castlemaine is reached. Another
name is clapped on it whilst it is going through the
borough. After it gets through Castlemaine it
is called the Bendigo-road until it gets to
Kangaroo Flat and Golden Square, when it is
known as High-street. Then at Bendigo City it
helps to form Charing Cross. After that it is
known as Pall Mall, or the Mall. A little further
on it is McCrea-street; then White Hills-road.
After White Hills it is dubbed the Murray-road,
and this sticks to it till it gets to Echuea, except
that the bits which lie in Elmore, Rochester, and
Echuca have each a separate name. The other
branch of Elizabeth-street is not so bad ; it is
known as Sydnev-road pretty well all the way to
Albury. Why can’t the first branch be known by
one name instead of about a dozen ? Let it start
from bait’s railway station as Murray-street, and
bo Murray-street in every town it passes through,
and when it isn’t in a town let it be plain Murrav-
road.

“ Steff Cassander ” : Now this is the plain
tale of Milesi. He was a fisherman who drew in
his nets along the Wellington side of Cook’s
Straits, from Karaka Bay to Terawhiti, and right
along to Makara beach. And Milesi prospered,
till he had working for him Macaroni and
Macaroni s brother, Vermicelli, and his cousin
Polenta, likewise Garibaldi and his nephew
Romulus Golisasum. But now Milesi is dead-
broke. And this was the way of it. They all
were under contract to sell to Milesi the fish
they caught. A poor sort of living always, but
they were satisfied, for they got cash at fixed
prices. They were able to dodge Milesi in the
summer time and sell to picnickers, thereby
winning a few extra shillings; but in the winter
they had to rely on Milesi. He had shops in
Wellington, and what he could not sell he sent to
Australia. But the warehou came. First day
there was a surprising catch of three tons. Every-,
body was delighted, and good prices were realised
m Wellington. Next day brought five tons; next
seven tons. Wellington really got tired of ware-
hou. Australia could do with lots, so the cable
B’y.d. More tons kept coming out of the sea.
Milesi’s countrymen kept pouring warehou
into him. He craved relief, but they would
not listen. He had no cash to give them ; never
mind, he could owe it. They buried him beneath
warehou. He filled up the freezing cos. with the
fish, but had no cash left to pay exes.—only ware-
hou. Milesi borrowed all be could op the fish. Still
more warehou. Cables from Sydney and Mel-
bourne said “Stop warehou; absolutely unsale-
ij'bl6-”. .Twenty-seven tons were on the steamers.
Milesi is bankrupt. Liabilities, thousands. As-
sets, warehou. And Macaroni and Vermicelli and
Polenta and Garibaldi, and the last-named’s
nephew, Romulus Colisseum, threaten to be un-
pleasant at the meeting of creditors.

“ Edyson ” : Mill and Mclvor had had
cabbage for Sunday’s dinner. Mill boiled it in a
kerosene tin, which was left standing by the camp
fire before the tent, and was still there at 8 o’clock
that night when the Metholeyans were shouting
“ Hallelujah ! ” in the Weewee chapel down the
slope. That black kerosene tin interested Alli-
son’s tame old-man kangaroo, Peter Jackson, who
was hopscotching round in the moonlight, seeking
adventures. There were a few scraps of cabbage
left in the tin, and Peter Jackson dipped for
them. He was very partial to boiled cabbage.
With head and neck deep in the tin, he over-
turned it, and was pushing it along the ground,
reaching for the last scrap, when Millassaulted him
on the tail with a stool. Peter Jackson bounded
from scratch, carrying the tin with him, and dived
right into a gum stump, driving the cooking
utensil hard down over his shoulders. The recoil
landed Allison’s semi-biped on the back of his
neck, but he scrambled to his hind hoppers once
again, revolved wretchedly in his tin disguise, and
hit out into the atmosphere with a leap that
might have cleared a house. Down the hill went
P. Jackson in a string of blind jumps, the most
astonished ’roo aboard this continent. His
tin lid never budged, and Jackson reck-
oned he was possessed of a devil. “Whop!
whop! whop!” he went, hurling himself
through space, like an astonishing develop-
ment in aeroplanes. His tenth “lep” sent him
with a crash clean through the big front
window of the chapel, just as Brother Praetor was
whooping it up in prayer, and calling on the
godly to “open up the windy ’n’ let they sperrit
in ! ” Pete Jackson hit that interior with a crash
suggestive of the landing of Nicholas of the Pit
with a cohort of fiends, and a great yell of terror
and lamentation went up from the worshippers.
Pete jumped again, and lit on the other extremity
of Brother Praetor’s bench, and that bench shot
one end up into the air, throwing the brother sky-
ward. Peter, still in his black tin helmet, hurled
himself into the atmosphere afresh, and knocked
the pulpit, which was a mere shoddv structure of
boards, out by the roots. It fell into the choir,
and the Rev. Ambrose Glasson fell on to the har-
monium. Things were getting brisk in Wesleyan
circles. P. Jackson’s next jump upset and ex-
tinguished the principal lamp, and for the next
three minutes the congregation busied itself trying
to climb out through windows and doors, while a
great personal devil, with a head like a coffin and
a devastating tail, flew round that interior and
worked woe and havoc. When the position was
thoroughly understood, the Metholeyans of Wee-
wee derived some shreds of comfort from the
knowledge that Brother Allison was the most
damaged saint in the bundle, his demented ’roo
having trodden on him during the first chapter of
the fray.
“ Larrikin ” : I sympathise with the wet-
weather wails of “ Fraulein ” (B. 12/8/’O9). She
knows the hopeless, soggy misery of the sloppy
season in the back-country. I had a bit of experi-
ence myself a while ago. It was on a big station
in Western Queensland, where the soil, after a
shower, sticks like glue, and the wheels pick it up,
so that when driving you have to halt every few
hundred yards and dig them out. When it gets
mixed with dry grass it is a terror to shift. The
officials of the big co. that owned the station came
up to inspect with the chairman of directors at
the head of them. They were in haste to get
back to Melbourne and the races. All of a sud-
den the drought broke, the rivers came down, the
“criks” were bankers, and the rain fell in
avalanches. And there was I playing hostess to
five desperate, race-mad, weather-bound men.
They quarrelled, and played cards, and made
wagers, while I fell back on my only trump-card
and fed the brutes. We were 80 miles from the
railway, and these men vowed they must get to it.
Buggies, they were assured, could not travel; even
a single horseman could barely get along. However,
the five said they would start if they had to walk
it. But instead of walking they had 30 horses sent on
ahead, and they themselves made a triumphant
start next day in a very light buggy drawn by four
staunch animals. That was at seven o’clock in the
morning—and wasn’t I thankful. At six that even-
ing I saw something crawling over the downs at
a snail’s pace. It came nearer and nearer, and
seemed sort of familiar. It was the buggy full of
the five friends, hatless, coatless, perspiring and
profane ! They had only got five miles along the
track, ar.d had been working most of the time
trying to keep the wheels clean. So that I had
the whole boiling back again on my hands for a
solid fortnight. I’d rather dig post-holes than
tackle such a business again.

“ Flinderino ” : A popular pastime in
some country townships, especially in Victoria, is
training for the Fire Brigades demonstration.
There are often as many members in a fire brigade
as there are houses in the township; and each
fireman reckons it’s about up to him to win a
prize. For weeks prior to one of these shows yoii
may, any day, see a wild-looking youth with a
hose-reel in tow, careering across a paddock,
humping over logs, scaring inoffensive cows and
sheep, sending rabbits scurrying off to their nests
in the gum trees, and generally raising Gain and
a dust and the Devil. Pulling up alongside an
old barn or cowshed the youth runs out the hose
and drowns an imaginary conflagration with
imaginary water. In some places members who
live a long way from the fire-station are allowed
to take the hose-reel home with them for practice
purposes. In a one-time mining township near
Ballarat a fire occurred in the dark hours of morn-
ing at the local bakery. The alarm-bell was rung.
The volunteer firemen bounded out of bed and
bolted, half-dressed, to the fire-station. The
pumping plant was there, but the hose and reel
were missing. Someone remembered that Charlie
Bunghole across the creek had borrowed it to
train with. The excited fire-fighters raced across
intervening potato-patches and woke up the
Bungholes, and then learned that the outfit had
been loaned to Bill Tregear of the Two-Mile.
There was a stampede to Tregear’s, where the
booty was eventually captured ; but by this time
the bread factory had gone to blazes, and the
night-dressed and pyjama-clad crowd of onlookers
was on its way back to bed.

first appearance on the Bench had to deal with a
common or garden variety of drunk and disorderly.
The “ accursed ” (as Casey dubbed him) pleaded
not guilty, and informed his Worship that he
never had a drink in his life. “ Well, thin,” said
the Court, as it polished the desk with its hand-
kerchief, “ try a cigar or somethin’ soft.”
HADES IRRIGATED.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
' Given water, and you may make a paradise of Hell.”—
vie. Irrigationist.
One recent night, when sore oppressed
With lobster roasted none too well,
I jumped from bed, and, scantly dressed,
Went on a walking tour of Hell.
I thought to find the damned on spits,
Or spiked on forks, a fiery red,
And writhing sinners cast in pits
Of boiling pitch and seething lead.
I found instead
A fertile land of green and rose,
And Satan squirting with a hose.
I rubbed my eyes, and stared again.
The hills were ripe with golden corn,
And Plenty spread upon the plain
Her mantle rich, and spilt her horn
Of sunset fruits and wine and oil.
Above the birds were all a-wing,
Sweet wild flowers bubbled from the soil.
’Twas always summer, always spring,
And in a ring
lleneath a tree the damned, arrayed
Like Greeks on vases, kissed and played.
The Devil marked me wonder-eyed,
And in his joyance I could see,
With proper gaiety and pride,
A touch of earthly vanity.
“You are an applicant, no doubt,
For blocks,” he said, “ by Heaven sent.
Just please yourself. Go look about
Our newest closer settlement.
We charge no rent.”
“ Great Scott !” I cried—“ first kindly tell
Whatever has come over Hell ! ”
He laughed again : “ You thought to find
Tlie fires of which your parsons prated,
We left that folly all behind
r When Hell was fairly irrigated.
Tiiere came a Roman scientist
Who found us in an awful fix.
With all my people to assist
He utilised the river Styx ;
And now Old Nick’s
The king of lands with millions crammed,
Who’re quite delighted to be damned.”

“Cross Nibs” writes a push story:—
The hard-faced citizen leaned negligently against the
plateglass window of a sixpenny restaurant. An after-
dinner flush o’erspread his features, and he was investi-
gating his dental formation with the small blade of a
pocket-knife. He unheeded the passing throng, and ap-
peared to exhibit an unusual interest in the right o’ way
opposite. Presently he pocketed his cutlery, and,
dodging an oncoming motor car, gained the other side of
the street. A square-jawed resident, wearing an outsize
grin and a small green hat, awaited his arrival. He re-
duced his facial contortion to accommodate a cigarette,
and inquired of the florid elector if he possessed a match.
“Wuz y’r toilin’ behind th’ count-out, Chewsdee night,
Squezzer?” questioned the diner as he handed over the
prepared phosphorus.
“ Dicken t’ th’ decision. I’m no bloomin’ gas-groper et
ennytime, Fummy.”
“ Were wuz y’r noisin’ in y’r brisket breeze then, old
spaivt?”
“Suckin’ in a chill current et th’ Glassyarum, Fum.
Ad me larst fad in frocks, teachin’ ’er t’ rip ice, ’n’ y’r
c’n bet y’r gay grin its tougher th’n rockin’ on rollers, ’n’
twice iz silent.”
“ Gotner time f’r it. Take it fr’m me, y’r missed th’
’otf.est date in y’r diary b’ staridin’ off th’ Alley larst night.
We piled on th’ pace f’r good ’n’ all.
“ Enny uv th’ blokes in th’ boob ? ”
“ ‘ Prodder ’ Peters, Ginger, ‘ Mop ’ Jackson ’n’ a bunch
uv barrackers are torn fr’m th’ ’ome circle. A pair uv
Johns rumbled ’em away in th’ confinement coach t’
town this arfter.”
“ Gor’blime, it’s a ’ot shot-in, Fum. ’N’ what drove th’
demons t’ muck up th’ college? ”
“ Well, it takes some constant chat, Squezzer ; but I’m
fit t’ yap it, all in. Th’ school wuz in ’n’ goin’ gay.
Prodder wuz whirlin’ th’ pair uv browns off th’ wood,
when all et wonst we ’eard th’ street door rock open with
a rattle. Iz rapid iz rain we ’ad th’ tools uv trade
pouched,’n’ Ginger ’owliri’ ‘Fight on, Fatty!’ When
Sargint Casey’n’two lizards uv th’ law’ad climbed th’
stairs ’n’ pranced inter th’ room they found Pudden
Byrnes ’n’ Cork Wilson wrist deep in th’ knuckle paddin’.
‘ Gotter good man ’ere,’ Prodder chatted to th’ sargint.
‘ I tell y’r, boss, ’e’s right shifts y’r memory ev’ry time it’s
pressed to th’ point.’”
“‘M’ yes,’ snaps ’is Stripes; ‘’e looks big enough t’
supply assault’n’battery.’ Then ’e dips’is eyelid to th’
two move-on peas. In ’alf a mo’ the}' wuz grippin’ Prod-
der ’n’ puttin’ it all over ’is pockets. Find me in fags, if
they didn’t drag out a double-’eaded stiver ’n’ git things
to a bubble. Before y’r c’u’d order drinks, Prodder
jolted one Hop on th’ jaw', tripped up th'other, ’n’ sprung
f’r th’ street. Then the ole blanky school put in a corned-
beef rush. We all found th’ asphalt, barrin’ Pudden.
’E got rapped on th’ conceit-cover with a baton. As they
were bouncin’ Pudd to th’ bail-bazaar, we smothered up
to do a save, ’n’ Ginger done ’is freedom in. Then the
unyform got shrewd. They took th’ tram ’n’ butted
right ahead f’r th’ custody barn. We got lively on our
leather ’n’ 'twasn’t long before a ’ot chorus wuz
(ummin’round th’Roberts’bungalow. Spare me sweat,
if we wuzn’t foolin’ with redlight. Somebody blew
a bray through th’ ’phone to ’ullo in th’ ’ops off
their beats. Pimps melted inter th’ mob ’n’ pointed
out condemned meat fit f’r removal. About seven ’ad
been dragged t’ durance, when Prodder sighted a slack-
eared smoodger flippin’ 'is finger to th’ clue-collectors.
In th’ twistin’ of a corkscrew ’e tore into th’ tick-tacker,
crushed ’is cady, split ’is neck starch, 'n’erowded violence
into ’im a million. ’E 'ad ’im a mauled moaner f’r th’
sick list, when four lumps uv authority reached out f’r
Prodder ’n’ piled ’im among th’ potted pewpils. ’E gave
’em a charnce t’git promotion. They got glutted with
graft ev’ry foot uv th’ journey. My oath, there’s no
nervous debility about Prodder. After Chewsdee night ,
’e’s just th’ ’airpin f’r sendin’ ’ome stoush ’ard ’n’ early.
To see ’im decorate th’ pimp’s photo pride with punch
wuz worth a week’s wages. Enny’ow th’ noise-builders
scampered f’r safety after th’ grand rally, ’n’ I turned
me trotters f’r ’ome. Too much night air isn’t enny good
f’r a bloke, y’r know.”
“’N’ when does th’ Fine Finger word ’em, Fum ?”
“Nex’ Fridee ’e bills ’em f’r th’ jollo.”
“Well, I’ll be there if I ’ave t’ be ’anded th’ travellin’
bag. ”
“Time enough t’ be sad when y’r soogeed, Squezzer.”
“ That’s orright, Fum. C’n y’r spill one in ? ”
“ It’s me medicine,” answered Fummy, as they moved
off to meet the nearest thirst hospital.
THE DECEPTION.
WHAGGD (who has been ordered off): “ Ah , well,
p’rhaps my appearances is o bit deceivin'.
but don’t be ’asty, you MIGHT be entertainin’
a’ angel unawares! ”
“ Jimmie Pannikin ” : Young Australians
are not all footballers or barrackers. Nearly every
small country centre in my district now has a live
rifle club. I speak of places so small that they
are not marked on the map ; some of them do not
even take The Bulletin. The pleasing feature is
the earnestness with which the shooters attend
the Saturday afternoon rifle-practice. In very
many instances the promoter and secretary of the
rifle club is the local school teacher. Shooting, like
swimming, ought to be learned when young ; then
the art will be a lifelong possession. I learned to
shoot straight as a cadet when I was a very small
Tin Drinking Utensil: and though I rarely have
time for practice now 1 can frequently find the
bull’s-eve when I go out to the rifle range with
the Boys of the Bushland Breed.
DISGUSTING.
THE OWNER (recently very horsey): “ Seven-horse power, and every horse a jib!”
“ Flinderino ” ; My friend Andrews has
lately learnt a good deal about the ways of our
black brother. Andrews sold his Gippsland farm
last year, and came up to Bananaland to try his
luck at cotton-growing. His new selection, out-
side Cairns, consisted of GO acres of scrub-land,
and, single-handed, he commenced to exterminate
the useless foliage. Finding the rainy season
close up, and only a very small patch cleared, he
thought of getting the help of a few blackfellows
from the camp just across the creek. The blacks
called on him every day to cadge flour and to-
bacco; but they always cleared out in a hurry
whenever strenuous exercise was suggested.
However, the man from Gippsland reckoned to
gain their sympathy and assistance by an act of
generosity. After getting an extra big
supply of stores from town, he called on the
heathens and talked business with them.
Andrews was a new-chum with the blacks.
They jumped at the terms. The intending
cotton-farmer was to present the camp with
a sack of flour, a bag of sugar, tobacco, bacon
and sundries, on condition that all the able-
bodied bucks would afterwards help at scrub-
felling. The whole tribe, including gins and
piccaninnies, followed the “plenty good
pfella” back to his humpy, and eagerly took
delivery of the flour and other commodities.
That night there was a sound of high revelry
at the camp. A willing corroboree followed
the blow-out. The news of the tucker-gift
travelled per wireless telegraph or bushgram
to the adjacent camps, and before many
hours were past black Billies and Nellies
commenced to come in from all directions.
Going across to the camp next morning,
Andrews found the place swarming with
strange Binghis, and they were still arriving
in battalions. The Gippslander got scared
and rode over to a neighbor to explain
matters. On returning, he found that his
humpy had been ransacked by the heathen.
All tucker and everything else portable had
disappeared. He took a loaded gun to
bunk with him that night; in fact, he still
keeps a loaded gun. Corroborees were held
across the creek every night for nearly a
week, and the yellings and thigh-whackings
were beginning to get on Andrews’ nerves.
But ori the fifth day s lence reigned supreme.
On going across to investigate, Andrews
found the gunyahs empty. Nullas, spears,
woomeras, shields, boomerangs, dilly-bags,
dogs and fleas were all gone. The blacks
had shifted camp.
“Coda” : In the Outback mining towns
of Westralia turkey-shaking occupies the same
place as fruit-shaking in the other States. You
may go away for a month, leaving all your doors
and windows open, and nothing will be disturbed,
but you must not leave a turkey alone for two
minutes. There are some of the most accom-
plished turkey-agitators in Lawlers that ever
lifted a feather. The guests never show any sur-
prise if the hostess announces that they will have
to put up with dog (any tinned meat is dog), as
the turkey has mysteriously disappeared from the
oven ; in fact, the chances are that some of them
are in the know. It is considered correct form
for the lady of the house to carry the turkey with
her when she leaves the kitchen to answer a knock
at the front door, and the visitor is supposed not
to notice it, as it is not a reflection on his honesty—
only a general precaution. Many a turkey has
been abstracted through the back door while the
operator’s cobber held the missus in conversation
at the front.
“ Henry Hor.secollar” : Re that gentleman
who is inquiring about something that will throw
a shade. I would recommend him to plant the
Stinking Fish lie. It grows very rapidly in any
soil, its spreading power is enormous, and it is the
shadiest thing in all Australia.
WOODLAND SONG.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
■The lecturer showed a great number of other photo-
graphs taken by himself of Australian birds in a state of
nature, which showed that not only a great amount of
time, but also Sherlock Holmes-like ingenuity, had been
used to steal upon the unconscious mallee-hen or brush-
turkey, and fathom the most profound secrets of its ex-
istence.—Daily paper.
The furtive fowl that hatches
Its shrill, bald-headed brood
Does well if once it snatches
A moment’s interlude.
For cameras are snipping
And snapping at each tree,
As photo-men come tripping
To spoil its privacy.
Now birds of ev’ry feather—
The male birds and the hens—
Rise up and shriek together
When at the nest a lens
Stares like an eye gigantic
And winks a rapid wink
That drives the moral frantic
And makes some fly to drink.
The click of spying shutters
Disturbs the turtle doves
That coo from high-roof gutters
The day’s news to their loves.
The owl his plumage ruffles
And turns a sleepy back
When in the loft some scuffles
Tell someone’s on his track.
The pelican when trawling
It always irritates
When Something comes a-crawling
And whispering of “plates.”
The starling and the sparrow
Can get no proper rest,
Though small the nooks and narrow
Wherein they darkly nest.
The cruisinggull that follows
The steamer’s seething track
Falls to the foam, and wallows
In horror on its back
When from the vessel flying
A Voice says calmly, “ Jim,
You see that gull there dying?
I got three snaps of him !

ANSWERS to CORRESPONDENTS.
yo notice (except of a hostile character) will be taken of
communications insufficiently stamped. Name and
address must appear on MSS. No liability is under-
taken re contributions voluntarily submitted, whether
sent by post or handed in; and no MS. will be
returned unless stamps (of any State) accompany.
E.M. A. : The Northern Territory isn't part of
the State of S. Aus. : what happened was that on July 6,
1363, the Territory was by letters patent “ brought under
the jurisdiction of S. Aus.” The letters patent may be
revoked by the British Government—in favor, say, of
Japan. That’s one reason why Australia can’t afford to
hang up the Northern Territory matter Spec (and
Australasia in general): When you send a yarn or any-
thing else to this office, don’t send a note saying “By
this post I am mailing you a story, and now enclose
stamps for return in case it isn’t suitable.” The chances
are that they won’t reach the office together, or that the
yarn goes to one man and the note goes to another, and
before the second man can hunt up the first man the
yarn has been sent to its grave. If you must write a
note, hitch it (and the stamps) on to the yarn
J.G.D.: Your suggestions are mere plays upon words....
J. W.C. : Two dead jests to hand... .Australia : Yes, as
you say, “ let something be done about it.” And this
paper is trying to get something done about it.... Wood-
pecker : (1) The English steeplechase fences are not
“ stiff ”as the term is understood in Australia. There is
no obstacle on any of the more important courses in
England which can’t be brushed through to a depth of
half a foot or more. (2) A matter of taste....Weka:
True enough, but it doesn’t sa> anything sufficiently new
toclamor for print A.A.S. : If “ numbers ” in Terang
think your dog-story suitable for this paper, there are
more maniacs in that town than we thought. The anec-
dote is too near to Nature even for a Bible class....
Erstwhile: Thanks, no P.W. : Kerosene-tin poem
regarded with grave disapproval.. .. Aus.: YVould
recommend bottle-oh-ing or egg-gathering Garnetß.:
“Not much of a yarn.” Amen! “Teddie”also uncon-
vincing. .. .Livingstone C. : Amorphous commonplace
R.B. T. : Everyday false-pretences yarn Equine: Horse
chestnut... .H. S. Greek : Feeble little story and “ Heave
your caps” poem both dead H.W.G. : You sing:
“Then is my time to think grey, pond’rous thought.”
But you needn’t have expressed it homeeopathically, as
it were ...Clyde Armstrong: Disjointed remarks in
alleged verse about “saucy bunnies” and other
fauna, irreverently thrown about some more
H.H. : Gruesome collection of unmitigated horrors
H.O.K. : Good old hee-haw of “ blawsted kawlinies ”
type H.E.R. : Alicia’s send-off too long and common-
place. . Blue Pencil: Rather trite, but will consider
further... H. Golding: Your own lies, or borrowed?
Toolooa: Painful rhymes: “Suicide”—“decide,” and
others Boronia: Sentiment all right, but poetry evi-
dently not your “meejum of exchange” Sten. E. :
Bogville poetry not of general interest 8.E.P.: Weary
old legend. Also, the “civic engineers” funniment
dodges us T.M.D.: Not of enough general interest
Jimmie Gungi: Rhymeless, rhythmless “verses” con-
tumeliously rejected F.N.M.K. : Story about the fat
man who bilked the publican may be true. It is also
venerable J.L.C. : Fight it out with Tennyson and
Marcus Clarke Toolooa: For cacophony in two words
commend us to your “’chine shears.” T.T.R. : You
detail the routine in Callan Park Asylum, and say
that the inmates are punished for insubordination if they
suggest improvement. But (1) there must be a routine in
such institutions, and it may not suit exactly each case ;
(2) you give no instance of would-be reformers being
harshly treated ; and (3) you forget that if every inmate
were to run the place as he liked, old Bedlam would be a
fool to Callan Park.... The Wasp: Six masterpieces
thankfully rejected. All the same, “A Woman’s Revenge”
on the gay young artist is to be commended for its
suddenness. “■* Oh, Wilfred, Wilfred, why do you shun
me?’ ‘Eileen, begone,’ he coldly responded.’” Then
she plunged a knife into his side, and, without pausing to
drag it out again, thrust it into her own body....
Leo Lear : Too long and thin Levana: Nothing novel
about a man using his ancestors’ monuments as stepping-
stones B.T.P. : Verses re airship are just plain hope-
less Claypan : Done to death, and mostly done more
vividly Sartor: Not worth patching ...Old Subs.:
Little Ah Chow, born in Australia, is a natural-born
British subject—provided Ah Chow', sen., isn’t “at
enmity with our Sovereign.” On the other hand, “for
the encouragement of foreign commerce,” J. Bull, jun.,
though born abroad, is British, provided either J. Bull or
J. Bull’s father was British-born.... Esca : No use for
anything but original work.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC) CONTRIBUTORS.
Vep : If it were artistic (which it isn’t) we wouldn’t
aim that brick at Murray Zodiac: A sinful outrage
• upon Art. ...Johnson : Picture of bottles outside a par-
sonage of no special value R.A.S. : Possibly there is
some concealed humor about it, but the concealment is
too profound Zero: We don’t profess to teach the
art of drawing in this column. If we did, we would
encourage a lot of unfortunates to waste time over a
business which would never bring them bread and cheese.
We don’t even remember now what your sketches
were like, but they were probably pretty bad
Dick K : All dead. In fact, two of those alleged jokes
have been dead a long while Ronald: Too scratchy a
a work of art... .George N.C.: None of them show any
promise—or any performance....Clif K. : The things we
would like to say about it are things we wouldn’t like to
say Alex. N. : Hopeless art T.K.: The boatman’s
dialogue is so absolutely English that everybody would
believe the thing to be stolen. Still we don’t say it is
stolen.. .Norman G. : The mere putting of a very large
head on a very small body isn’t necessarily caricature.
There are other essentials W.P.F. : Your idea of how
to draw a dog is unique.... YV.N. : Heaven only knows
what may be the meaning of that joke about “the public
service mask ! ” Anyhow, it has gone into the basket
Chris M. : Long picture with Sahara of blank space
between the shapeless figure on right and the two thin
figures on left. And then it’s only a pun.... C.M.A. :
Without form and void, and darkness was upon the face
of the deep ... Anonymous Person : Sketch of officer sit-
ting at table and making, in soliloquy, that old joke of
our boyhood’s days about the lady who wanted “ the
pleasure of his company.” It was down long ago to Kind
Words and Chatterbox and the Child’s Companion
level Hopkinson : One is old and horrible.
Recognising you as a sender of aged hor-
ribles, we view the other with suspicion
J.R.: Utterly bad and hopelessly unsuitable P.K.:
Your picture suggests a masterpiece by one of the Old
Boshters—Reubens, perhaps, or Plato or Oleograph or
one of these people Lambert: Jokes mostly dirty and
horrible, and all the people in your pictures bristle as if
they had been tarred and feathered.... Reginald A.S. :
Seldom has the evening dress drunk been depicted more
dreadfully. And after the thing had gone to the basket
and then the ash-heap came your letter enclosing stamps
for return. Why not send stamps and address with
drawing ?

Archbishop O’Reily (R.C.) has joined the
Adelaide Institute of Journalists. He once ran a
paper in W. A., and not only wrote the bulk of it,
but also helped to set it up, and then ran the
machine. Afterwards he addressed the wrappers
if the office boy was busy. The Archbishop is
recognised as the patron saint of Adelaide
scribblers.
JOHN FOSTER FRASER.
Some people take a long time to die in
Maoriland. In a recent football match at Wae-
kanae, Henry Burling, allegedly aged 109 years
took first kick, and sent the windbag at least
18yds. His side won. He has a boy said to be
87, who is now learning the game and getting on
splendidly.
Donald Fraser, who died at Homebush
(N.S.W.) a few days back, was one of the officers
imported by the Bank of New South Wales 40
years ago. He married a daughter of Mr. J. H.
Potts, who was accountant to the bank in the
thirties, and owned Potts’ Point, where Sydney
Sassiety afterwards built its castle keep and its
bloated grange.
“ 10-2-4 ” describes “ Jumbo ” :
“ Jumbo ” Armstrong, who died last week, was the
tallest, burliest, surliest and kindliest of N.S.W.’s Crown
Prosecutors. He had a dread of the Australian working,
man and his machinations that amounted to an obsession,
but believed in giving him a scrupulously fair go when he
came before him in the way of professional business.
Armstrong was an Oxford man—at the time he started
prosecuting there was a sort of tradition that N.S.W.
C.P. s had to be English University men—and all his life
he bore a vague reputation for erudition and scholarship.
He married a sister of the late George Innes, Judge.
Alexander B. Shand, K.C., who, on behalf
of the “ Incorporated Law Institute of N.5.W.,”
opposed the re-admission of K. D. Meagher to the
roll of solicitors, will argue the Institute’s appeal
before the High Court. The Institute has dug
all its claws into the case; it has a fierce craving
to keep Meagher off the roll, and it and that
Gentleman One are struggling on the verge of a
precipice, so to speak. Shand was admitted to
the Bar 22 years ago, along with Wilfred
Blackett and Dr. Brissenden. He is a heavy-
weight, with a jaw that sticks out like “a
coal-scuttle when he gets going. He argued
the Meagher case before the N.S.W. Full Court
for half-a-week, to the agony of their Honors who
dropped useless hints about brevity, and the
misery of George Beid who had to listen to it all
with an insufficient supply of confectionery in his
pocket. And Shand will probably talk the High
Court into an early grave on the'matter. There
is no precedent, it is said, for an appeal against
the re-admission of a solicitor, but the Institute is
feeling so wild that it intends to make a precedent.
Neither Barton nor O’Connor will sit on the
Bench to hear the appeal. The Meagher case is
so very old that they were both “in it’’away
back in the days when there was no Federation,
no High Court, no nothing.
THE ARK OF ’ARRIS.
Bill ’Arris reckons ’e ain’t goin’t see ’is ’appy
ome turned aimlessly adrift in the next flood: so
he takes precautions to maintain a control of affairs.
Two imported Railway Commissioners,
one in N.S.W. and one in Victoria, have struck a
sort of a coincidence. Johnson’s M‘Myler hoist
fiasco costs about £70,000, and Tait’s Sunshine
smash runs to just about the same bill.
Died last week, aged 92, Mrs. E. M.
Barton, who was connected with many of the
early families of Sydney. Her husband was Com-
modore Barton, of the old East India Co.’s ser-
vice; but quitting the sea he and his wife became
pioneers of the Molong district (N.S.W.). No
doubt Gregory Blaxland, the explorer of the Blue
Mountains and a relative, “put them on” to
that district. She has left three sons, including
C. H. Barton, M.L.A. Another son was the late
H. F. Barton, formerly Master-in-Equity ; and
one of her daughters was Mrs. E. S. Paterson
mother of “ Banjo.”

Philip Muskett, the well-known doctor
and writer of Australian medical books, who died
last week, was son of Charles Muskett, once
a bookseller and stationer of Fitzroy and Mel-
bourne. Philip was born in Brunswick-street
Fitzroy, in 1857. The mother was a daughter of
Edward Charlwood, theatrical bookseller and
printer, who had a place in Bourke-street, near
the G. P.O. in the ’fifties. He and Shaw, Harnett
and Co. shared all the theatrical bill-printing of
the time. Charlwood and Sons were agents for
Lacy s plays, a big item in the book-trade in those
days. For some 12 years Philip was the only
child ; then came Alice, the artist, and the pair
constituted the family. Philip was a devoted son
and brother—so devoted, in fact, that he had no
room left in his affections for a wife, wherefore he
never married, which was a curious thing for one
who was so essentially a children’s doctor.
There is as a
rule little variety
about the proces-
sion of disillus-
ioned husbands
and dissatisfied
wives through the
Divorce Court, but
one recent Mel-
bourne case wob-
bled a trifle from
the customary rut.
The pair were
joined with the
customary church
rites in July, 1905,
and dwelt togeth-
er in lodgings till,
just three months
later, the husband
returned oneeven-
ing about 11,
found the bed-
room door locked,
and heard whis-
perings within.
He desired ad-
mittance and an
explanation. The
bride refused both.
He then stepped
round and opened
the window,
whereupon the
lady, in no way
disconcerted,
merely stepped up
and closed it
again, with the
assurance that she
“didn’t want him
any more.” He
thereupon depart-
ed about his busi-
ness. His Honor
had some diffi-
culty in believing
this simple narra-
tive, but finally, out
of the depth of his ex-
perience, he decided that
it was as likely as not, and gave the discarded
male a chance to make another experiment if
he were so minded.
limi Kara (Jimmy Carroll) having been
made Acting-Premier of Maoriland—mainly on
the ground that he was the 'least
likely to do anything sudden in
Ward’s absence—6o Maori chiefs
of the North Island have just pre-
sented him with an address of
flowery congratulation. It is in
Maori, of course, and is “from
the tribes of his ancestral canoe,
T.tkitimu.” One way and another
the chief is having a great time just
now. Lately Timi came down to
Christchurch in the departmental
car, with a few pakeliafriends ; and
in the same train, and also in a
special car, a party of fat chiefs
travelled luxuriously, with Maori
mats and rugs wrapped round
them. The races that followed
were most enjoyable—for Timi’s
friends, the bookmakers.
“L’Fou”: We are accustomed
to let foreigners make our clothes.
But vvhy—why should we let a
Canadian railway manager obliter-
ate wholesale the pretty native
names of our little Victorian townships and re-
christen them with hackneyed banal European
designations, some of which are already borne by
a multitude of towns in other lands. Even Koo-
wee-rup is gone, and replaced by Dalmore, which
is a second-hand designation from Scotland. If
this changing of names is to go much further, let
us change Tait’s name. Let us call him Sarco-
phagus, or Labyrinthodon, or perhaps Mud.
The fund started for the benefit of the
widow of Dr. Kevin Izod O’Doherty—better
known to old Irish patriots as “Eva of the
Nation’’—brought in £1306. The expenditure
up to July 12 was £5l ; and, after various pay-
ments have been made to Mrs. O’Doherty, there
still remains £857 invested in Queensland securi-
ties. “Eva of the Nation” is now 83 years of
age, and lives in Brisbane.
THE SYDNEY FOOTBALL SITUATION.
THE UNION BOSS: “’ Struth , there’s some low-
down work going on; I’ll have only bricks
and mortar left soon.”
The late Arthur Morrah, ex-Public Service
Commissioner in Victoria, surely put up some-
thing like a record for a Government officer—he
left £42,260 for his family to cut up.
Died at Potts Point (Sydney) last week,
John Armstrong, K. 0., the father of the N.S.W.
Bar. He was admitted on Nov. 17, 1864, three
years after the late Julian Salomons. He is suc-
ceeded in the paternal capacity by C. E. Pilcher,
admitted on March 26, 1867. “Jumbo” Arm-
strong was an Irish giant from King’s County, and
came early to Australia. Although well on the road
to the’nineties, he carried himself as one a quarter
of a century younger, and grasped briefs with both
hands till the last. No one knew exactly
“ Jumbo’s” weight, for he broke the Scales : nor
his chest measurement, for he was a Sabbath
day’s journey round the vest. His head was leo-
nine, and his face heroic ; but he was a modest
man, and his charges were much less than his
diameter. He lacked a dash of audacity, and he
hadn’t the money-grabbing instinct. At intervals
he Crown Prosecuted and District Court Judged.
VARNISHING DAY AT THE ROYAL

AN ASSURANCE THAT WE ARE NOT RUNNING
AWAY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
People in Australia must not run away with the idea
that the Conservative is a politician who advocates
that things should stand still and never progress. Some
of the best factory legislation in England was engineered
by the Conservative party.- —Foster Fraser, of America,
Canada, Siberia, and the earth generally.
We re not running, Foster Fraser ! Hereabouts is where
we live,
And we think we have the measure of the good Con-
servative ;
But we’ll pay, and sit and listen if you’ve further light to
give.
We’re not running really, Foster, with the theory vou
say! v
It’s the men who write and travel, as a rule, who run
away.
Then we have to contradict them. (Which, of course is
by the way !)
You have not been long amongst us, so you may not be
aware
That we have our own Conservatives a-squattin«- here
and there.
(They’re a great world-wide affliction which all sons of
men must bear.)
We have found them very selfish—also deadly dull and
slow,
For weVe had to shove and lift them on the road all
nations go.
And it’s cruel work and thankless, this free carriage of
the foe.
After lifting well and safely, almost ere we could un-
bend,
We have often been astonished when we reached our
journey’s end
By this sort of malediction: “ Ah-h ! this Socialistic
trend !
“What this country wants is ballast! It is rushing
blindly on h
To the dogs of destitution ! And I say it would have
gone
Long ago if men of standing had its madness smiled
upon! ”
That is his voice as we know it, and the sort of dirge he
chants
When he’s carried like a beetle by the Socialistic ants,
And Democracy beneath him struggles on with puffs and
pants.
He arrives sometimes unaided—or he seems to. But
you’ll find
If you look a little closer, or you are not color-blind,
That the small but living forces are propelling him
behind.
No, we are not running, Foster, with the theory you say.
It’s the train-cwm-mailboat writer, as a rule, who runs
away
Then we have to contradict him—and the process turns
us gray !

No sensuous souls were won by fraud ;
No loud-mouthed Yankee walked the sea ;
There was no chairman of the Board.

Has grown “ religion ” to a trade.

At least who rules for living sent,
O’er Him long since deep billows ran—
Drowned in the Yank’s advertisement.

SCIENCE SPEAKS.
In the treatment of any wound or sore, you
must not disregard the facts revealed 'bv
scientific investigation. To heal speedily and
permanently it-is essential to cleanse the affected
tissues and remove any poisonous element that
may be present. The part must then be so
soothed and vitalised that Nature can restore it
at once.
To accomplish this result, an ointment must be
used which, in its action while" allaying all
irritation, penetrates to the underlying tissues
and purifies t horoughly. _
Chase’s Universal Ointment is recognised as
the most unfailing preparation for the treatment
of cuts, wounds, bruises, etc., and skin
diseases in cases of long standing.
This famous Ointment is now manufactured in

HAVE YOU
INDIGESTION ?
*
Then Learn the Right Way to
Cure Yourself,
»
The Treatment Tried by this
Australian Woman Gave
Excellent Results.
If you have indigestion, and you oegin a course
of treatment to make your stomach stronger, you
are on the right track for a real cure. You will
never cure yourself by eating pre-digested foods
or by taking purgatives. The stomach isn’t doing
its own work under these treatments, and there
is no real cure until the stomach is strong enough
to digest all the food that is necessary to maintain
the body in norma) health. The aim of the tonic
treatment for indigestion in all forms is to
strengthen the stomach to a point where food
eaten will digest easily and nourish the body.
A tonic that will strengthen the stomach is what
is needed. As the process of digestion is con-
trolled by the blood and nerves, Dr. Williams’
Pink Pills are the ideal tonic. They actually
make new blood and tone the nerves. More
important, they have cured a lot of people of
indigestion. Here is an instance :
“I was never very robust, and some time back
I had a bad turn of indigestion.” said Mrs. James
Thomas, Little Regent Street, Sydney. “I
couldn’t fancy any food ; it was as much as I could
do to sit down to the table, and the food I did
swallow was always repeating on me. It lay for
hours like a cold icy weight on my chest and the
ache would go right through to my shoulder-
blades. I was this way for more than three
months. I’d feel as if I viierechoking. I couldn’t
get my breath. I grew thin and lost all my color.
At the temples and just on the top of the head I’d
get splitting headaches that racked me terribly.
I always woke with a nasty taste in my mouth
and a coated tongue. I’d often have to lie down
during the day. Sometiures I’d have dry retching,
other times I’d have to vomit, and then I’d f( el
better. My heart was always beating veiy
rapidly, and frightened me terribly. It wou.d
seem to go up into my mouth at the least start.
I’d get dizzy turns, as if the floor was rising and
falling, and my sight would go dim. At last my
cousin told me how good Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills
were, and got me three boxes. When I had
finished the first box I felt a little brighter and
easier, and the food began to have some taste in
it. From then I felt the better for every dose I
took. The headaches went away and my heart
eased down. The horrid pain after eating left me
and my face got a better color. I. had no need to
take more than three boxes.”
Be sure that you get Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills,
for the many things that are said to be just as
good have never effected any cures. They are
sold by chemists and storekeepers, price 2s. 9d.
per box, six boxes 15s. 3d., or they will be sent
direct on receipt of price by The Dr. Wdliams’
Medicine Co. of Australasia Ltd., Sydney.*

POLITICAL
POINTS
Sydney Telegraph (26/8/’O9), talking
about the necessity of economy in the States in
view of the new financial arrangement with the
Commonwealth, pertinently asked
Do we need two Houses now that so much of the former
worlc of Parliament is being done by the Federation, and
by Shire Councils, while the steady tendency is to remove
departments and services from political control and place
them under Boards and commissions?
To which this paper cheerfully replies that we do
not. Let the Telegraph
by all means go ahead
with its State House
demolishing operations.
A LESSON IN ACOUSTICS.
OFFICER (in anticipation of visit of Lord
Kitchener): “Not nearly smart enough. On
the command ‘ Eyes right,’ I want every eye
to go hack with a click.”
Public Opinion, what crimes are committed
in thy name ! The Argus declares that “public
opinion forced the political leaders to the settle-
ment reached by the Premiers’ Conference.”
Curious, isn’t it, how often “ public opinion ” is
opposed to common desire :
What wonder that we often find
The people do not know their mind,
When it is “ made up” more or less
Each morning by the daily press !
The States’ tentative agreement with the
Commonwealth with regard to the finances has
set-the old Cabbage Tree mob groaning again that
the Ma State has to “ carry the bundle,” and that
Federation is the conspiracy they always said it
was for fleecing the poor old lady. It is amazing
however, how Sydney is bounding ahead under
the fleecing process. In 1901-2, before the con-
spiracy had got properly to work, the Sydney
and main suburban tramways returned only
3'34 per cent, on their capital cost; in the
past year, to June 30, they gave 6'64 per
cent. That is a difference of 3'30 per cent, on
the total outlay, which means £112,255. So if the
Sydney and main suburban lines had only given
the same return as they did before the Federation
curse got down to regular work, N. S. Wales's
bundle of revenue would in the past year have
been £112.255 less from this one small source
alone. The stupid Cabbage Tree mob’s idea,
however, is that it is only the bundle of expendi-
ture which Federation has fastened on to poor
Ma’s back.
A selector in
the Victorian Hey-
tesbury forest, who
was summoned for
wages a day or two
ago, said that “ in
the forest the
wages for a good
man were £1 per
week, and for a
second or third-
rater they were
considerably less.”
At present this
forest is knee-deep
in water where it
isn t neck - deep,
and scores of
alleged roads are
impassable. The
bush worker has
his feet always wet,
and usually most
of the rest of him.
Yet the top-notch-
ers amongst bush-
men get £1 a week
for working under these conditions. Still, the
country is so awful that the unfortunate selectors
probably can t pay more. Most of them, indeed,
can t pay wages at all, and the work has to be
C ‘°!J e u )y the , se ! ect °r’s wife, his man-children
and his maid-children. Nevertheless, Squatter
Macarthur lifts up his voice to allege that
le large land-owners “are adequately meeting
le demand for land”—just as though selectors
went into this sort of morass from choice and not
from sheer necessity.
An item from the Parliamentary reports
published last week in a Sydney Foreign-trade
daily paper
„l r ;j" hnSO ", quoted from a letter to show that since
hidnsirv m m'o w W Pr °t e otionist tariff the clothing
industr.v in N.S.YV. had steadily declined.
According to Statistician Coghlan there were, in
1901, when Federation and the high Protectionist
tariff were just beginning, 14,128 people employed
in the clothing industries of the State; and,
according to Federal Statistician Knibbs, the year
1907 saw the figure up to 21,922 people. These
aie official returns, and might carry some weight
with most people ; but Johnson takes no account
of them, and depends entirely on “a letter”
written, or alleged to be written, by some party
unknown. It was the best evidence the poor
wretch could get. The Foreign-trade push has to
struggle along a very dusty road these days.
roi^i S S a ha ' s rushed ifcs public debt up to
n>3, an increase of nearly a million and a
half during the year. Even deducting
the sinking- fund of £2,233,385 (the
largest and most genuine sinking fund
m Australasia, by the way), the debt
stan( | s ilfc £7l 12s. Bd. per head, against
fcoJ Is. sd. per head a year ago. So
Westralia wdl soon be a third candi-
date for the honor of having the Big-
gest Debt per Head on Earth. There
was a time, while the gold boom and
the immigration boom and the big loan
boom were all at their height, when a
Westralian politician remarked regret-
fully that it might soon be necessary
either to reduce taxation or to charge
some public works to revenue instead
of to loans. The State has got over
that embarrassment of riches now, and
is kind of sorry that it went on the
burst quite so hard when the great
boom was with it. The parable of the
prodigal doesn’t work out well in real
life. When he gets home after his
burst he generally finds that his parent
has turned teetotal in his absence, and
the only fatted thing that the old man
kills in his honor is the water-hole.
The N.S. W. State Government is seriously
discussing the idea of spending £150,000 or
£200,000 on a new Parliament House. An awful
spending capacity has the Deform Government
Yet it is quite obvious that before long the State
Upper House must go, and when Australia is cut
up, as it must be, into 30 or so small handy States
a whole lot of the Lower House must go also'
The present building is old, moth-eaten and ram-
shackle ; but it should be replaced, not by a
palace, but by about £50,000 worth of clean little
structure suited to the circumstances of the case.
Some few months ago a syndicate in
Christchurch (M.L.) decided to import 12 taxi-
cabs; but when the first two arrived, and the
syndicate gazed upon the cheap English-made
bodies, it swore. Then it cabled to
telling it to send out only the chassis of the re-
maining ten cabs. When these arrived they were
turned over to a local motor-body builder, and the
results are now running about Christchurch. It’s
an awful thing to print, but the. bodies made in
Maordand are beautiful to look upon, and streets
ahead of the imported stuff.
Apropos the proposed payment of a salary
to the Leader of the N.S.W. Opposition, the
blessed Constitution Act doesn’t mention such a
Parliamentary person, or even contemplate an
Opposition. In the early days, the Leader of
the Opposition was not easily identifiable. The
member who railed most against a Government
was generally gagged with office, or taken on
as leader of the Ministry. The way in
which Cowper, Martin, Forster, Robertson and
Parkes contended and combined was remarkable.
It was Joseph Palmer Abbott who, some time
after the collapse of the Jennings Ministry, in
1887, surprised the Constitution by informing the
House that he had been appointed Leader of the
Opposition. Such a thing had never been done
before, and Speaker Young hastily searched for an
authority, or a precedent, or something to hang a
word or two on. He failed to find what he
wanted, and for a moment the Constitution
tottered on the front tooth of a precipice. Then
suddenly’ Speaker Young didn’t say anything and
the country was saved.
SAVED BY SOCIALISM.
The year’s profit on the Socialistic Victorian Railways
having: turned the Murray-Graham deficit Into a surplus
of £150,000, Treasurer Watt is now going to introduce
legislailon to permit the using- of railway surpluses for
general purposes.

According to Wade, the arrangement fixed
up with Deukin is that “the amount to be re-
turned to the States by the end of June, 1911,
will be governed by the population of the Com-
monwealth at that date.” In other words, if
Wade tells the story right, the States are to get
255. per head of the population as at June 30,
even though there may have been a considerable
number of arrivals during the year from whom
the Commonwealth hasn’t collected more than,
perhaps, a few months’ revenue. Here, for in-
stance, is the difference between the end-of-the-
year population and the mean or average popula-
tion of N. S. Wales during the last few years :
End-of-the-Year Average
Population. Population. Difference.
1905 .. 1,496,007 .. 1,478,703 .. 17.304
1906 .. 1,530,984 .. 1,514,390 .. 16,594
1907 .. .1,573,214 .. 1,554.783 ... 18,441
1908 .. 1,605,009 .. 1,588,550 .. 16,459
So if, as Wade says, this little trick has been
played by him and the other State Premiers on
the Commonwealth, then on the basis of the last
four years, the Commonwealth during the next
four years will be diddled out of £85,997 by N. S.
Wales alone—by 255. per head, that is, on the
difference between the average population and
the population at the end of the year.
From the “Old Soldier” :
Prime Minister Asquith lias told the House of Commons
what he thinks the Defence Conference has decided.
The land-forces are to he “ standardised,” which is ex-
plained to mean “ the formation of units, the arrange-
ments for transport, the patterns of weapons, etc., being,
as far as possible, assimilated with those recently worked
out for the British army.” “As far as possible” is a
good phrase, since it guards against disappointment if
people are not amenable to the blandishments of the
superior person in London. The Dominions are to be
careful not to get anything in the way of arms or
transport arrangements better than the infallible people
in London consider good enough for the British
soldier. Ten years ago they found their fi-ld-guns “ out-
ranged and outclassed ” by those the Dutch farmers of
South Africa had bought in Prance arid Germany, and it
would never do to have Australia, Canada or. S’ Africa
throwing the Ma Land into tire shade like that. Furthi r :
“ While the Dominion troops in eacli case will be raised"
for the defence of the Dominion concerned, it has
been made readily practicable in case of need that
the Dominion can mobilise them for the defence
of the Empire as a whole.” There is the craze
for uniformity. The Dominion troops might be very
much more useful with the best obtainable equipments and
arms not of regulation British pattern ; but then they
would not look uniform if acting with British troops. The
decision of the Defence Conference is not in favor of
giving the forces of the Empire the highest possible effici-
ency. They need not be efficient, hut they must be uni-
form. It is well known that the British regulation army
rifle and the present fi Id-gun are far from being the best
in Europe ; but they are to be the standards for no better
reason than they are the British regulation. So Aus-
tralia mustn’t get ahead of Britian even if it can. If
Britain wears a leg-rope, then Australia must be leg-
roped too.
A faint remark has lately been heard from
an old bogus ghost, inasmuch as Senator Pulsford
has written to the papers saying that he doesn’t
despair of Freetrade. The trouble is that Free-
trade has despaired of Pulsford ever since it first
met him. A Freetrader who tolerated high Pro-
tection for N.S.W. beer, wine, sugar, tobacco,
cigars, cigarettes, confectionery, biscuits, Free-
trade newspapers and the like was such a joke
that the old Cobden gospel said it absolutely
declined to know Senator Pulsford, and it repudi-
ated him as an impostor in the camp.
Most of the people who want the Com-
monwealth leg-roped by means of the 25s. per
head refund to the States have an idea that it
would be a shocking thing to extend the Common-
wealth’s powers any further. Yet here is a case
which shows how futile and foolish and wasteful
the present system is. Under the Commerce Act
the Commonwealth can prescribe what shall be
placed on the labels of patent medicines as a fair
description of the contents; but after the medi-
cine has passed the Customs the local agent can
tear off the label and put on any old description
he pleases. At the recent conference the States
were asked to pass legislation to supplement the
Federal Act, and they promised to “give the
subject full and careful consideration.” Which
means that when the six States have agreed—
which will be about next century—they are to
pass six separate and distinct but similar Acts
through 12 Houses of Parliament, to do what
ought to be done by one simple measure passed
through one legislature.
THE POINT OF VIEW.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Now that we have some idea of what Australia’s con-
tribution to the defence of the Empire is to be, we may
safely begin to discuss the whole question from the new
point of view.—S. M. Herald, 27/Bfo9.
London has spoken. Wherefore we, who live
Bv moulding Sydney thought six times a week,
Must state our naval views once more, and give
The same in clear, calm language. Hear us speak.
The Dreadnought scheme is numbered with the dead ;
In the Town Hall its pale corpse may be seen
Lying deserted and discredited—
As a plain fact, it never should have been.
The Dreadnoughters meant, well, of course. To doubt
Their bona fldes were unkind. Their view,
However, that the only way to rout
A foe was by applying to a Jew
Was on its face, so patently absurd,
So foreign to the spirit of the race,
That we, soon as ’twas put to us, demurred
And said it nay, and ’gainst it set our face.
Once people talked of “concentration ” and
One Mahan and of his “ sea-power ” theories ;
And argued that the light for this vast land
Would not occur in any near-by seas,
But in the distant Baltic, and that hence
Our fleet should he 12,000 miles away
In time of stress. Whereat we said “ How dense,
Preposterous ! You know not what 3'ou sa3'.”
Sternly we set ourselves to demonstrate
The polic3’ Australia should commence,
If it would save itself from the grim fate
Of other nations that tried bought defence.
Both in and out of season we implored
Our readers not to go on leasing ships—
And has-been ones at that. Cold scorn we poured
On Hired Defences, and with eager lips
Called loudly for a real Australian fleet;
One which would carry real Australian tars,
And not proceed to speed with flying feet
Abroad as often as the changing stars.
Now we have got it, so we cheer like mad
And bash the C3'mbal and concuss the gong—
What’s that? You hint we really aren’t so glad !
Absurd ! We hankered for this all along !

A WOMANN'T LETTER.
Sydney, August 31, 1909.
My Dear Arini,—-
On an afternoon last week there was for the
Sydney daffodil enthusiasts but one place of im-
portance in Sydney. For that crowded hour St.
James’ Hall was their Mecca. The daffodil show
was held there, and there was a new daffodil. He
—the true believer does not say “it,” and as
Narcissus was a pure he-Greek, they could not
call her “she”—well, he, the Stranger, came
from Camperdown, in Victoria, and was grown by
a solicitor, Mr. Buckland. He was a big, golden
trumpet flower, and that is the kind of trumpet
on which the daffodil fanatic would prefer to
have his fame blown abroad. It seems that
Victoria is better suited to the development of
this long-liueaged, poetic flower than our State.
Our longer, warmer summer bakes the bulbs
somewhat. There were snow-white daffodils,
there were straw-toned daffodils, there were daffo-
dils orange and daffodils lemon, and when two or
three true believers bent over a specimen and ex-
changed comments in serious tones, one was
forcibly reminded of physicians in consultation
over a serious case. The faintest bit of extra
curl in the corolla, or a microscopic deviation in
the circularity of the corona, are matters for
undertones and knitted brows. Mr. Selkirk, of
Killara, scored in the bi-colors; and Mr. Sayers,
who is, I believe, a banker, also went daff-t as a
prize-winner. The Hugh Dixsons sent some-
thing prizeworthy; and Mr. C. W. Holloway, of
Manly, did likewise.
The most interesting exhibit for the average
person was the fine pot specimen of a pitcher
plant. It carried at least a dozen pitchers, most
of which could have held a quarter of a pint of
rain. Wonder what were Nature’s intentions
when she planned the pattern of the pot vege-
table? Were they honorable or dishonorable?
Did she mean to catch and drown insects, or to
conserve water for the travelling man and bird ?
Anyhow, she did the job perfectly. The mid
rib of a long leaf is continued (instead of
ending at the leaf-tip) for about sin., and
on this grows and hangs the pitcher, a perfect
cornucopia. A close-fitting lid, like that on the
German student’s big lager-beer pot, guards the
interior until the pitcher is fully developed, when
it dries up and gets out of the way. No doubt a
specimen of this freak water-carrier may be seen
in the Botanic Garden hot-houses. I had run
across it in the past on occasions, but it didn’t re-
member me. Now I’ve a mind to borrow the
plant, take a hall in the city, and exhibit it with
tea and cake included (for consumption, not exhi-
bition) at Is. a head. Proceeds to go to the Child
■Study Association.
Melba left on Sunday night with her concert
party for Cootamundra, Narrandera and places
with names like that, including Albury. I saw
Narrandera once—it was doped with the per-
fume of acacias from trees in full bloom, the
same as the trees that hang over the
walls of Paradise. The night before' her de-
parture, the songstress rose to the farewell occa-
sion in beautiful voice and an orange-lily gown.
The gown seems now to be very nearly as im-
portant as the voice of the gownee. Dolores was
a shocking froeker, and the poor thing had to rely
on her voice only to make good. She is, if my
memory serves, the only star artiste of recent years
who did not try to dress up to her melody.
Melba’s tiil-we-meet-again robe seemed to be of
soft satin. It was square cut as to corsage
in front and at the back a large-sized capital
V was scooped out. A big, deep-yellow chry-
santhemum lay over the diamond stream on
her left front. Rivers of diamonds flowed
into an ocean of the same hard, bright ex-
pensive things. The lady must have pretty
good command of her temper, for although
she laughed when the idiotic crowd of female Phil-
harmaniacs threw flower missiles right at her face
and head, she must have felt like calling the police
and giving them in charge fey- unprovoked assault.
A thorny rose spray thrown at short range is not a
compliment when it lands on the face. If Melba
had got it in the eye she might have had her head-
light put out. As it was she got it in her front
hair, and in hauling it out she tousled her pompa-
dour, and tousled hair doesn’t suit Melba.
The singer’s singing of the waltz song from
Gounod’s “Romeo and Juliette” —well, I was
going to ring in the skylark to help me out
with my appreciation of that item, but he
and the nightingale are such overworked
birds that I let him go. It was a song,
in perfect art and of profound sweetness. Elsa’s
Dream (“Lohengrin”) calls on the listener
for great endurance unless she be a con-
fessed meloinaniac. Most of Melba’s gener-
ously given encores were quite new to the
majority of concert-goers. Rare and dainty
bits of melody they were. In the Inflammatus
her voice rose, triumphantly above the surround-
ing crash-bang of organ, piano, orchestra and
Philharmaniacs. It was a terrific row, and re-
minded me of Hamlet’s alliterative phrases about
his step-father’s supper party : “The King doth
keep his rouse to night, and as he drains his
draughts of Rhenish down the drums and trum-
pets thus bray out the triumph of his pledge.”
More about Melba : She and her white-faced,
fragile-looking sister, Mrs. Lempriere, and their
brother Mr. Something Mitchell, who is exactly
like Shorty McCabe (You know that inimi-
table person, don’t you, in the book “Side-
stepping with Shorty?”), went to the private
view of the Art Society’s show in Vickery’s
Chambers. She bought four pictures—two
landscapes by Lister Lister, one by a new
man named Jackson, and Norman Carter’s black-
and-white study of the head of Marshall Hall.
Melba’s keen, dark, bird-like eyes looked out at
the works of canvas from under a curious toque
of black with a broad brim-band of tangerine—
the breast feathers of some bird apparently. The
show seemed to amuse her immensely. Report
says that her brother “Shorty ” Mitchell really
knows a merely bad picture from a horrible one.
According to Melbourne press and oral reports,
the enthusiasm that greeted Amy Castles, re-
garded both as a singer and a woman, did not fall
short of the standard set by Melba and Crossley.
The story tells of audiences that rose and
cheered as one enthusiast, crowds turned
away from the overcrowded hall, and a mile
of carriages and motors with acetylenes streaming
away into the darkness. All the pomp of a star’s
triumph pomped there. The givers thereof re-
member that the girl has come back while yet in
her early prime to let them hear her at her best.
It all means time snatched from the crowded,
high-feeing and musicianly Old World, and as the
koala remarked, “ Time is gum leaves.”
Miss Sumner Locke, a Melbourne girl who has
put down her hat-boxes, pulled out her hatpins
and charged her fountain-pen in this city, was
part-author of the one-act play, “A Martyr to
Principle,” produced at a matinee at the Royal
last week. Her partner in the tragi-comic case
was Mr. Stanley McKay. The argument is here
or hereabouts: A young man has consumption
and a fiancee. He broods upon the thought that
he may by-and-bye infect his wife and trans-
mit the disease to his children. So on
his wedding morning a thought is hatched
and he takes poison. It is a case of
suicide on principle. The best-man-elect is in
love with the girl who just missed being a wife,
so the audience is left to nourish the hope that
the cheated bride will soon have a second offer to
face the altar. A humorous maid-servant is a
counter-irritant to the dismal gentleman in the
wedding garments. Mr. Cam Marina played the
“martyr” capitally, Miss Elsie Prince was the
fiancee, and Miss Eva St. Clair the cheerful serving
damsel. Mr. Harry Hinds did the doctor best-
man whose services were required in a medical
sense, instead of as a beast of burden to carry the
ring to the church. Miss Locke has a longer play,
“The Vicissitudes of Vivienne,” to her credit.
It was produced for a charity in Melbourne some
moons ago.
St. Martha’s Home profited by the performance
of “A Martyr to Principle”; also by the cash
returns of “Niobe,” played by the Muffs. Miss
Ella Crone, as Niobe, made a very fine piece of
statuary, and when electrified into life she wore
the other girl’s scarlet frock too successfully
to please the other girl. Miss Ada Baker, as the
citric spinster Helen, took most of the spontaneous
applause going, and the rest was appropriated by
the large and capable cast of amateur players.
These tableaux (from operas) in aid of the Civil
Ambulance were staged on Saturday afternoon,
and followed by the Sydney Comedy Club’s per-
formance of “When We Were Twenty-One.”
All well-known feminine Sydney—well known to
the private secretaries of the Federal and State
Government Houses and to the police (the police
know motors and carriages and their occupants
cjuite well) —raged for a whole afternoon at pos-
ing, or selling posies or programmes or chocolates.
But the majority of the section was in the
audience. Every seat in circle and reserved
stalls was taken at 7s. 6d:, and the Civil
Ambulance will have over £3OO to go on being Civil
with. “Berlin on the Spree” from “ The Girls
of Gotten berg, ” was the best representation in
my unhumble opinion. The tunics, ankle-length
pants and chorus hit the audience into making a
great noise of approval.
The “ Florodora ” sextette made one think of
the late George Lauri and his “ O ! some one must
have shaken a peach tree.” The girls looked like
the very best peaches, and the young men looked
as if made of the best cardboard, and were good
advertisements for somebody’s tailorings and top-
hats. They wore these same hats well back
on their cerebellums, just as the French fashion
papers show the golden youth of Paris at Long-
champs racecourse. The Miss Walker above-
mentioned made a charming Veronique in a
swing tableau with her brother, and another
alluring figure was Miss Ruth Dangar with
a rather sheepish Rajah of Bhong. Mrs.
(Dr.) MacCormck, Miss Eadith Walker and
Mrs. T. H. Kelly (last was the relict in
a “Merry Widow” tableau) worked for the
good cause. Mrs. J. C. Williamson quitted
her box early in the performance that it might
be sold to a belated buyer.
The “Cadonia” set —the king and his bride
standing in front of the throne—came last, fortu-
nately for the preceding pictures, for it made
them look, in retrospective comparison, drab as
scrub turkeys. Clayton and Miss Dorothy Court
put up a powerful spectacular plea for the mon-
archical idea of the pride and might and glory that
should hedge a throne.
Julius Knight spent Monday in Sydney pur-
suing that elusive quarry, a desirable furnished
residence. He ran it down at Mosman, near
where he lived during his past season, and will
enter into possession early in December. Miss
Beatrice Day was also on the house chase in a
taxi-cab. She chased in a navy coat and skirt and
the cutest scarlet waistcoat and black hat.
Members of our own old nobility will be pleased
to learn that they are at present breathing the
same atmosphere as Lord Charles Fitzgerald, one
of the uncles of the young Duke of Leinster, and
brother of the fiance of Mrs. “Havilah” White.
The visitor, who is accompanied by his daughter,
is a good-looking widower of about the magnetic
age which is between 40 and 50. Many years ago
he quitted the home of his ancestral banshee, and
has lived since his marriage at Riddell’s Creek, in
Victoria. A few months ago his wife, an Austra-
lian with a Greek father, died. Beulah Flats
shelters the Fitzgerald father and daughter during
their stay in this pittosporum-scented Sydney.
Miss Helen Austin, a pretty and popular girl,
died last week at Bathurst, where she had gone in
search of the dry air that is the hope of con-
sumptives. The scourge only visited her a little
over a year ago. She was a niece of Poet Laureate
Alfred Austin, and leaves a brother and several
sisters, who mostly reside in Sydney.
Saw Miss Grace Watson gliding through this
stock-scented city (aren’t the stocks a riot of
perfume and color ?), and I can bear witness that
hers was the best-coiffed head on the Block. No
female personage in history ever laid a better
dressed head on the block either. This is merely
in reply to detractors from Brisbane who said the
Conferencers had dressed their hair with a clothes
peg and an umbrella handle. I said “hair-
dressing” to the mercurial party, and it acted on
her like “fish” spoken to those dear delightful
seals at the Tivoli. “Every member of the con-
ference,” averred Miss Watson,” had an’ expert
hairdresser’s services every day.” So if the
arguments of the Women’s Anti-Socialistic
organisations were faulty, their hairdressing
ought not to have been. But perhaps, owing to
the heat of argument, the hair didn’t last.
Miss Nita Walker, daughter of Senator J. T.
Walker a.nd a cousin of Miss Eadith of
that ilk, is announced as on the engaged-for-
matrimony list. Her groom-elect, Captain Ralph
Verney, is A.D.C. to Governor Chelmsford. He
is an exception to the usual coin-chasing English-
man, naval or military but mostly naval, who
weds the Australian maiden, for he has, report
says, a fair share of the valuable substance. Any-
how, he runs his own motor-car, and you know
yourself that a man can’t honk-honk or chug-chug
on his own account on an A. D.C.’s salary. The
J- T. Walkers live at Wallaroy, the same house
from which a former occupant, Miss Mitchell,
married Excellency Harry Rawson’s son. Walla-
roy ought never to go begging for a tenant
in this over-girled community. Also there will
now be more inducement than ever for the fashion-
able amateur to go mumming. Captain Verney
proposed to Miss Walker on the stage of Her
Majesty’s whilst rehearsal for tableaux was seeth-
ing around the twain.
Norman Lindsay’s pictorial dream of fair women
(which is my name for the exhibition —not the
artist’s) will open at Angus and Robertson’s
gallery on Wednesday week. The portraits are
in charcoal medium, and, amongst others, will in-
clude Mrs. Edwin Ryrie, Mrs. J. C. Williamson,
Mrs. Herbert Marks, Mrs. T. H. Kelly, and Mrs.
(Dr.) Jamieson.
When women who were at the Hotel Kosciusko
during the recent snow carnival there were told
last week by the Lyceum management that their
pictures would be “projected” by Spencer’s
Theatrescope, they made haste with such hurry
that you could not have caught them with a
motor-car. Most of us humans look appalling
scares in the pictures ; but the snow scenes are
very fine. The two Kiandra youths, who are
fairly expert, make a most thrilling show as
they come down the precipitous, snow-covered
hill at incredible speed on skis, launch off the
high snow bank into space, and alight erect pos-
sibly 30ft. distant. A leap of 138 ft. has been re-
corded, but that was in Scandinavia, the.home of
the ski-runner. Often a Kosciusko leaper falls,
which is amusing. The depth and softness of the
snow prevent it being tragic.
This certainly seems to be a good time to avoid
going down to the sea in ships. There is too great
a chance of staying there. For a fortnight hardly
a day has passed without a wreck or mysterious
disappearance being reported. It may be, of
course, that the vanishment of the Waratah has
roused a keener interest in nautical affairs and
directed the editorial mind to the toll of the deep.
Anyhow, though the number of wrecks may not
be greater than usual, certain it is that the number
reported in the press looks larger; and there
seems to be the best of reasons for regarding sea-
travelling as a mighty dangerous business that is
getting no better very fast.
Queensland would seem to include in its popu-
lation a large number of charitable persons. The
issue of The Bulletin in which I wrote, some
months ago, a few paragraphs descriptive of the
work and aims of the Hospice for the Dying, is
still wandering around and picking up guineas
for the charity. Up to date it has brought over
£3O, and the latest donor of a guinea is another
Queenslander who merely signs himself “The
Lad,” and sends his money “ via Winton,” in the
north-west of the State.
I cut this peculiar personal advt. from the S. M.
Herald
"D ACHELOR (50), Prot. £3OO, corresp. with spinster
or similar person— Sid, Herald.
“ Spinster or similar person ” looks comprehensive
enough as a feminine definition, but is elusive on
closer examination. Who is similar to the spin-
ster? The blushing maiden, the established old
maid, the unmarried woman, the housekeeper,
the platonic party, the Suffragette, Mag-
dalen, Tottie, or merely Mary Ann ? And
then, to spread out the list further, there is
the Woman with a Past, the Woman with a great
many Presents, the Woman who Did, the Woman
who Wanted To, and the Girl that Didn’t Care.
Are they all similar? It vaguely suggests the
careful witness who swore that the defendant
leaned over the balcony “ and called out ‘ Tom ! ’
or words to that effect.” She said something
similar.
“ Stray,” who is really Mrs. “ Waif,” the wife
of the verse writer of that pen-name, sends this
from London :
The Englishman-husband had told me many things
about England—how the British bloater was a bloater ;
how St. Paul's was an edifice, and the Thames a clear,’
pellucid stream ; how the lark soared singing in the
bright blue sky, and one could taste the buttercups and
daisies in the produce of the cow. I haven’t disproved
the bloater yet, and St. Paul’s is certainly an edifice. It
has a wedding-cakey altar and. some nice pictures by
Watts, R.A., in pretty gilt frames on its walls. The
Thames—well, I’ve seen the Thames. I’ve played Nar-
cissus with it, having mislaid my hand-mirror. As for
the lark, it did soar ; but it came down after an hour’s
soaring and said, on its honor, there was no blue. And
the buttercups and daisies nodded affirmation when I
questioned them regarding their flavoring capabilities,
and the cows blandly bore testimony.
I hastened to the grocer’s and bought butter, and 10,
it was margarine ! The Englishman-husband said I could
procure anything in London. And given time, patience
and a few taxicabs, a good memory and a long purse, I
probably could. I know you can get a small basket’of
fruit, containing two oranges, a banana, two figs, two
apples and a bunch of grapes, for £2 2s. You can get a
nice, wee, watery vegetable marrow for XOd. You can
get a rose for 4d., a poppy for Id., a dear little bunch of
grass for Id. So the poor need never starve. It is also
on record that someone bet a man that he could
get anything he wanted at Blank’s, the all-embracing
store place. So the taker-up of the bet wrote
for a second-hand coffin, and got it by return post. Thus
the supplying capacity of London is proved.
Then there was Henley ! My credulity was getting
frayed ; but having discovered, by the aid of the glasses,
enough blue in various quarters to make a pair of
trousers, I agreed cordially that it was a lovelv day, and
that Henley must be seen. We caught a third-class
carriage just as it was escaping from its creditors, and
away we went past villages, damp hay fields and smiling
hedges and things to Henley. A few college boys got out
and a girleen or so. It all gave me a tremendously thrillv
feel, and we hastened along to be there early and avoid the
crush.
We stood on the bridge to admire the spectacle. There
they were—dozens and dozens of vacant boats lying lazily
side by side, along each of the river hanks ; and down one
side of the course were some more with flannelled gentle-
men and linened ladies, and a nice lot of cushions. Across
the road—l mean the river—were the private houses of
the thrice-blessed, and the billiard table lawns were gaily
decorated with empty chairs, and here and the’re a
human. Knowing the British propensity for food I con-
cluded the “vast crowd of fashionably attired guests”
was demolishing a stray meal. So we passed on along the
river bank to see the houseboats. There were quite
seven.or eight of them, so pretty and suggestive of
swagger furniture and gramophones and good cellars.
Mr. Vanderbilt’s gardener—the under one—was pruning
the geraniums, and a lady in lilac waited pensively on the
adjacent boat for hi n who certainly ought to have come,
•^\ e « r D a w - ent »/'^’ a Pi? 80 Aid the race. Somebody
said “ Bucks wins.” In the search for truth I followed
alongside the race, keeping on the path of course, and
verily he had prognosticated well. Bucks did win,’ and
there were l£ cheers. Corpus Christi was defeated by a
few nose lengths, and the crew were done, panting and
gasping in fine Tittett.Brune farewell-night fashion. The
s P e °tacle was too painful, so I went to see the grand
S’ osXfed.”* y ° Pen ‘ EaCh
There was a comfortable “ did-the-dishes-before-I-came-
out” look on the feminine faces that were wandering up and
down, eating strawberries out of bags. A nice kind juggler
was doing his tricks with the giggling aid of two little boys,
taken at random from the circle of little boys thatsur-
rounded him. The Enjrlishnian-husband was touched.
jj e threw a copper. “ Bless yer, Gawd bless yer, mister,”
said a newsboy, in broken accents.
Boom 1 Off went the gun again, and a sculling race
started. It was a pretty sight and the unemployed
s
pupil to “Keep to him; he’s done, he’s done!” A few
college boys took up the parable, and the poor “done”
sculler was done.
Then we had a glimpse at the silver cups—they looked
awfully wedding-presenty, and the pressmen were care-
fully closed in their pavilion near bv. There was a band !
“Is this Henley?” I asked at length, and the English-
man-husband said testily that it was. Seeing that I was
anxious for information, he showed me the hills and
Tell, Ple Island, and the hay fields and the crab apple trees,

si i enC e side by side while two more races were run, or
rowed, rather, and I bought a Japanese umbrella in case
it rained.
“I sav,” I said suddenly, as the inspiration hit me,
“ ISR ’t Henley a town ? Well, let’s go and see it.” And
Z for' T b °T ht a of
tea tor eac “ an( i a basket of early raspberries for a
king’s ransom. Then we caught another third-class
carriage.
“ What I did expect”—the Englishman-husband opened

“ was a regatta with old and new boys cheering lustily,

richness and sweetness to its tone, increased
its repertoire, and enabled it to give more
people more of the kind of music they enjoy.
The Amberol Records play for four minutes

The first indication of croup is hoarseness,
and in a child subject to croup it may he taken as
a sure sign of the approach of the attack. Follow-
ing this hoarseness is a peculiar rough cough. If
Chamberlain’s Cough Remedy be given as soon as
the child becomes hoarse or even after the croupy
cough appears, it will prevent the attack. It is
used in many thousands of homes in Australasia
and never disappoints the anxious mother. We

Reliability, durability and efficiency may be considered
as going hand in hand as the first considerations in the
manufacture cf the most desirable Motor Tyres and
in no tyres will this trinity of features be found more
pronounced than in the ever-popular Continental variety.
The Continental Co.’s interpretation of the word
“reliability” is “ability to get there,” and not only
to get there, but to get there well; to be certain at the
commencement of a journey that the end is in sight.

MELBOURNE CHATTER.
Melbourne, August 30, 1909.
Mr Dear Yarrik,—
The V.A.S. had its day, and it. was a riot of
glory. The ball or the scramble or the mad car-
nival expended itself within the prosaic limita-
tions of the Masonic Hall, which is enveloped in
a foggy, stodgy atmosphere that penetrates from
the lodges above. For picturesque setting some
hall with a sweep of stairs apparent in its heart —
like the one at F’ran or St. Kilda—would have
better filled the scenic bill. Anyhow, the crowd
ripped things up with fervor, and produced a finer
effect than that of a common or ballroom ’op. It
was wickedly masked and dominoed (no frank,
uncovered countenance successfully braved the
Dweller on the Threshold who guarded the
door) and spent „ a couple of ecstatic hours
gazing at itself—blinking and squinting through
the goggle holes of its ready-made mask.
Snugly plum]) damsels piously embraced the
fancy-dress opportunity afforded them of showing
that they were bifurcated animals—otherwise, that
they owned legs, and sonsy ones at that. One
scarlet atom whirling in the dance showed a
tantalising glimpse of white skin between the
tops of certain black hose and the rim of a few-
linch scarlet skirt. Mannish muscular nether
liuibs appeared in skirts, and softly feminine
understandings clad themselves like unto the
Pantomine Boy. Even blushes were disguised,
and made no headway at the unmasking.
Toby and Chloeand Butterfly made the banana
of the salad wherein the rare fruit of an original
dress showed up briskly. One butterfly varied
the monotony by being a moth—a beauteous
©reature, all filmy grey and staring golden eyes.
A streak of method in the carni valistic madness
came from the art students. They were a pageant,
an historical glory, and a hundred odd of them
dressed to the day of Coeur de Lion. Even the
heralds'had spent weeks poring over old volumes
to make sure that their pictured selves were
inserted in the right century. Two of the beauty
boys of the Daulrers’ gallery were in the royal
glory of blue and scarlet and gold—correct even
to the rolls of their hose. They carried a banner,
and blew a brazen howl from several feet of
orchestral tubing. In lonely artistic splendor
they paced the length of the ballroom. Then
catne the Black Prince in Brunswick-blacked
armor and hearse-like plumes, wondering
where the dickens his spurs were —the ones
Ihis dad said he must win. Crusaders
were there without any crusade—beautiful crea-
tures of chain mail and scarlet cross (the students
had spent months on their garbing). All the
noble lords and ladies, and the jester and the
minstrel who sang songs under Richard’s window,
came along. I did not see the window sill—it
may have been in the procession, but the whole
affair was a gorgeous gorgeosity. The retainers
and the “ fellows ” dropped from the ranks and
left their liege lords to joust on hobby horses. A
■dragon appeared (he had been in a blue funk half
an hour before because his forelegs were not
knitted), and the horrific animal proceeded to eat
up a careless damsel who strayed beyond the
boundary ropes. “ Whack ” came Saint George (he
doesn’t often get a chance to do his stunt
these centuries), rescued the squealing one.
and slew the monster. The monster did
not mind—he wanted to get on to his
next part which was that of a beautiful Mon-
tague (Monty for short) languidly bending in a
minuet with Juliet. The same student had
already been a herald, and the rest of the com-
pany are yelling at all the fat going to one
mummer.
In the minuet half the girls were Juliet, with
pretty Unie Russell taking the pearl cap.
Several stately dames of the full-grown artists
also condescended to minuet. An Apache pair
got the floor for a few brief minutes, then the
he-Hooligan had to deal out stoush to the invad-.
ing crowd. A notable art critic glowered from
the cave of curls of a Charles Rex rig. A Honey-
Boy wanted to appear with merely an eye blacked
out, but a rigorous abridging committee pro-
tested, and he was persuaded to wear an insane
cap and a bell or two.
Mummers came on to the show after their own
strutting. The Asche-Bravtons were given a
pageant to themselves with an announcement by
heralds—the bit of Shakspeare was of their
■“period.” By the way, in the Procession of
Twelfth Centurians an assertive maiden and her
liege insisted on walking in the rear though they
were distinctly Elizabethan. They had no sense of
anachronism, and ruffled the lords and ladies of
the Crusade considerably. One does not spend
foqr months studying out the points of one’s hose
just to be riled by other centuries flinging them-
selves into the picture. The herald, who was
afterwards the dragon, and anon the minuet,
wanted to slay them, but could not add a fourth
to his three parts by turning executioner. Mrs.
Brough catne, after unmasking, all in grey,
with the Second Mr. Brough, and mum-
mers were scattered round in luxurious pro-
fusion in the early morning contingent.
Mrs. Bravton had scarcely recovered from being
smothered —or squeezed in the throat, as her
modern Othello playfully treats her. Othello
himself gets considerably “done out” by his
strenuous ways of making love. Next week, the
“ Othello ” show is. to alternate with the com-
paratively delicate “Taming of the Shrew ” —to
give the principals time to take breath.
A make-believe black-a-Moor in the crowd tried
to pose as Oscar the Lion, but was hooted by a
tow-headed Desdempna.'
Some imposing dames subdued their carnival-
istic sense but added to the picture with many-
guinea empire frocks. The affair was wildly
jovial, especially to the aftermath who considered
neither coachman nor chauffeur, nor yet the horrid
shriek of ye laste trayne, but trusted to their own
motley-clad limbs to carry them home. Collins-
street and the saveloy men joined in the gaiety of
nations at three o’clock in the.morning, while the
carnivallers made a continuous line of sound from
the hall to their holes in the roof. That ball was
a hummer all right, they conceded, even when
viewed with the bunged eyes and leaden head
of Next Morning.
Two pretty girls, Medico Davenport’s daughter
Doris and Miss Aileen Tolhurst. lately gave a
sort of post-flapper dance in the St. Kilda Town
Hall. Both maidens have just hoisted their hair
(most supremely fair) and lengthened their gowns
for the taking on of full-fledged society wing?,
and this dance was a glorified mention of the fact.
The mothers of the maidens made a background in
the nominal capacity of hostesses ; but the star-
shine stood to these fresh young girls just in the
last lap of their teens. It was a marvellous dance
in these days of Wu.se dancing men, by reason of the
fact that all the wallflowers wore the crow-like black-
and-white gear affected by masculine butterflies.
Every maiden had as many dances as she pleased,
and added unto this the glory of turning down a
horde of beseeching bees of men. Quite 400 folk
must have accepted the “ card,” and the hall was
shimmering and crowded with people and fasci-
nating frocks. The hall itself was dressed in
wistaria—wistaria drooping and climbing and
smothering together in wildly luxurious
abandon ; and the lights were softened with
white jellyfish shades, drooping with silver fringe.
Mrs, Davenport wore heavy gold embroideries
on her ivory gown, and Miss Davenport’s dress
was her favorite blue. Miss Tolhurst looked
sweet 17 in white ninon, and Mrs. Tolhurst’s
gown spread in all the glory of Saxe brocade.
The Winter Irvings, the Grimwades, the Ryans
and all Toorak and St. Kilda seemed to be
gathered together for the gaiety. But the young
girls of the family had their finest time; it was
their extra special dance, and for once they were
of far more importance than their elder sisters.
The commanding officer and other officers of the
Fifth Australian Infantry Regiment are “request-
ing the pleasure” for a ball at P’ran on Friday, Sep-
tember 10. They will doubtless get what they
ask for.
On September 3 the City Newsboys’ Ball—that
hardy annual in a charitable world—is to pirouette
for the helping bawbee. Much distinguished
patronage is drilling the wayward youth in the
usual “sets.”
The Royal Comics are back again after
wading through the wind and storm of the Polar
regions of Maoriland, and on Saturday night
Florrie Young sang gloriously and washed dirty
linen in “ Dantzic ”at Her Majesty’s. Everybody
went to welcome the favorites back, and the
somebodies who could not be seated in the stalls
of the mighty had to put up with the circle,
even unto the fourth and last lap. Many fine
voices twist comic opera phrases into grand opera
warbling. One never knows when the mummers
will leave plain modulated speech and suddenly
soar off into vocalism. With Roberts and
Hughes and Courier, not to miss the pleasing
pipe of Fan Dango and the bleating of
Higginson —with all these helping Florence of
the Young voice, this sort of thing is easy.
Sometimes the whole crowd gets so excited that
everybody sings at once. It’s ever so much more
musical than everybody talking at once. The
ballet doesn’t sing, but it meets the case with
toned bells on its toes and a high note of cerise
in its frocking. Stamford’s Napoleon doesn’t
reach the hero-adoring damsel’s heart. He doesn't
warble—not that that matters to the adoring
damsel aforementioned —she only wants her
Nappy to look heroic and interestingly pale in
a gloomy attitude. This Napoleon looks merely
like a small boy who’s eaten the marmalade and is
not sure if the jam’s been missed. Yet even
with this blot on the Corsican’s escutcheon,
the play pans out pictorially enough. Fan
Dango wears her fetching ingenue frocks,
and when she’s not putting soubrette tones
into her patrician Grande Marechale mouth
she’s pleasing as an imitation of a feather
in her dancing. Dango is a dandy dancer —none
of the similar soubrettes reach her in featheriness.
Poor dear Higgie, once so adored, is seen at a
disadvantage. He suffers from having to make
love to a butterfly no higher than his elbows.
Mrs. Jack Scott gathered together a vast
Vienna tea-party to welcome sister-in-law Mrs.
Charles Tait—the pretty little wife of one of the
numerous Tait brethren —who has been wandering
in the highways of London and the Con-
tinent. Mrs. Scott expected the guests-in-
chief to come overland from Adelaide ;
but as they stuck to their barque the
be-partied ones only arrived in this foggy town
about an hour before the shivoo. Mrs. Tait
managed to rescue a cutely-cut navy tailored rig
out from her boxes before ruthless carriers hauled
them away, and she also extracted a duck of a
hat—a big black lid with what is modern for the
cut of a Gainsboro’. Mrs. Scott swept round in
her capacity of hostess in clinging directoire gar-
ments, top heavy with the latest cry in furs—the
vast hug of black bear that runs into a huge ex-
panse of mud. Sassiety in general swelled the
tea-swilling crowd. Amy Castles dimpled amid
the crush.
Amy Castles is getting her houses and hauling
in adoration by the handful. Every concert has
grown in fervor. On Thursday night a hilarious
management was sending wildly in every direc-
tion for extra chairs in order that it might pack
the overflow on the platform. A series of
mammoth corner screens kept the goats from
the path of the sheep, or rather from the
track of the one woolly lamb that warbled
clad in silken Parisian gear. The colleen is Lock-
ing well. Her figure is snugly slight, with pleasing
curves that suit the clinging ninons of herdirectoire
gowns. The outer gear is Frenchified in coloring.
Fainting colors —mere ghosts of tints—cling in
filmy layers like mists. She wears a new frock
at every concert and a-t every appearance
off the platform. The young lady has evi-
dently been on an epicurean debauch among
shops. What appeals to the envious gazer girl is
that there is everything to match. It represents
the pinnacle of sartorial glory. Amy has developed
a “ manner ” —an air, pleasingly quiet and very
natural. Her voice is a natural glory—pure silver
melted. Pity it is that the girl is not a grafter. Lazi-
ness hangs to her footsteps—languor of anything
except the pouring out of the bird sound that is
there naturally in her throat. Technical faults
mar it where a genius of study would make of it a
marvel. Nevertheless for all her study-laziness,
she trills like a bird, a delicate tumble of sound
that is a surprise after some minor brusqueness in
technique.
The menkind are a glory in themselves. Nicol—
an Italian in appearance and a braw Scotch
laddie in his tongue —is a tenor to make one
sit up. His is a delightful voice. Peter Dawson,
quite a beauty man —a small gentleman with a
big voice—is a bass youth. His asset is a
voice that climbs and descends amazing heights
and depths, but does not rumble thunder-
ously. People are being well treated with this
company. The pianist, Victor Biisst (another
Australian), belongs to the same high plane as
the singers—a delicate player of fine temperament
and feeling.
The Shakspearian concert that Charlotte Hem-
ming organised the other week, on behalf of one
of the Melbourne hospitals, produced a profit of
£132, so the brow of Charlotte sports another
laurel, and an extra piece of bird-plumage adorns
her hat.
Sydney's own and only Miss Rose Scott has
been on a Melbourne visit, and has been feted and
lunched and dined and wined and tea’d and
bunned till she must have longed for the supply
to run out. The Writers’ Ciub entertained her
one afternoon, and each pen woman was called
upon to add a trifle to the visiting lady’s portly
autograph book.
“Rosna’’ sends a special wedding number
from Adelaide: —
There is a boom in weddings, and shares in the Matri-
monial market may be expected to rise any minute.
Last, week the lawyer Heuzenroders’ eldest damsel May,
and Mr. Tom Shanahan, having received the blessing of
the Church and five or six tons of other presents, went off
together in search of honey. The ceremony happened
at St. Ignatius’, Norwood, where the bride, in white
taffetas and chiffon, was encouraged by three pale-blu*
silk maidens with heliotrope bouquets. An out-of-doors
luncheon on the paternal lawns and beauteous weather
assisted in distributing peace and joy among several hun-
dred guests.
The youngest Plummer girl, Muriel, sister of Dr. Violet,
our first Miss Medico, will ask Hymen to do his best for
her on September 8. The other interested person is Mr.
'Schofield, and the knot will be tied at the bride’s home
1 without much of the world being called in to admire.
Later, Mr. Hymen will superintend another event at
,St. George’s, when pretty Molly Syrne, a great grand-
niece of this Province’* first Governor, will enter
into a binding agreement with Mr. Hedley Chapman,
who grows wool and wheat and other vegetables away
beyond Port Lincoln.
Not to be outdone, dainty little Connie Verco and her
(young architect, Eric McMichael, will ask the overworked
gentleman to spare them a few moments early in October.
Then there is a bush wedding that is to happen in a few
weeks. The bride will he clever Trix Mills, daughter of a
squatting family (and incidentally a direct descendant of
poet Tom Hood); the fortunate other half is a young
medico, Dr. Betts, who patches up Maitland and the sur-
rounding country. The knot will be tied at the bride’s
station home, Beetaloo, in a garden which is a riot of
roses. ' .
In the! matter of frill and circumstance, a recent Aus-
tralian Wedding in London took all the eatables. The
inan waS Charles Gosse, son of the late Dr. John Gosse of
Wallaroo, and the lady was Beryl Nicholas, of the Apple
Island. (Various bishops and lesser revs, attended at St.
Stephen’s, Gloucester-road, on July 17, to see to the
ceremony ; and the bride wore satin and Limerick lace of
great antiquity—there were even marks of the Flood on
it. Six maidens asked the bride to bear up, in silk frocks
embroidered with pink and blue ; and there was a recep-
tion afterwards. Mr. Gosse is a relation of the moneyed
Alexander Hay folk, some of whom sailed in the Wafatah
the last time it left these parts.
Those of us who are not being married go and view the
floods bj! way of solace. We have picnics to Che drowned
localities—take our lunch and make a day of it. The
inland seas are subsiding now. and the residents of the
submerged neighborhoods are hanging their houses out
to dry, aind rescuing their children and dogs and horses
from the tree-tops. A horse up a tree is a lamentable
gight. One unwary couple at Hope Valley were married
during t)ie prevailing damp, and the result was chaos. It
Was on evening wedding, and the cab horses that had
fieen hired to draw the bride and her maidens to the sac-
rifice took exception to the unusual geographical arrange-
ment of rivers and lakes en rout*. They stopped
work, and the only substitute available was an
old draught horse, which kindly consented to drag the
party the rest of the way. By this time most of the male
wedding guests were out swimming in search of the lost
tyride. The two were eventually wedded, and then all
mbved to the Insti/ite for speeches and cake. But things
got still worse. Most of the men. however, managed to
svvjim home, though the she-guests had to spend the night
in'the Institute.
Tall, humorous-eved Foster Fraser examined our sins
of omission and commission fixedly all last week. The
State asked him to come in and occupy its best spare
bedroom, and hang the expense ; hut as he hadn’t quite
decided what he was going to say about us, he declined.
Meantime he lectured at the Theatre Royal every evening
to crowded houses. Their Exes., with all sassietv trail-
ing after, wore their diamond tiaras at the Monday
lecture. Another night Chief Justice Way was to have
presided, but influenza held him back at the last
moment.
The Mayoral Varleys, instead of giving Glenelg a ball at
which only a quarter of the populace can scramble, have
decided to supply the town with a lecture every Monday
night for five weeks. Professor Henderson’s fine disserta-
tions on “Empire Builders” will begin the novel and
sensible arrangement; and later Mr. Frederick Bevan
will enlighten the inhabitants on Arthur Sullivan and all
hjs works, with vocal embellishments by a band of his
prize singers. And the opportunity to acquire all this
mental polish is being handed out without tax or pa} 7 -
rnent.

The Sydney Art Society’s Annual Picture
Show.
|“Bnt,” said a lady amateur to Mr. Whistler,
“ll paint what I see ! ” Then the shock came :
“iDear lady,” said the great artist, “ Where did
y<jm see what you’ve painted?” So far, the Art
Society has received no shock. It leaves that for
tlie unconscious wayfarer who strays within its
gates. But if, like this writer, he has been there
before, he will feel strangely at home, recognising
the same old subjects, the same old manner of
wasting expensive paint, the Same old frames,
knowing that the dear old fatuous Art Society can
be but itself to-day, yesterday, and for ever.
The president, amiable artist that he is not-
withstanding, is wasting his time in painting such
small pictures. He should be satisfied witn
nothing smaller than a stage back-cloth or the
siijle of a cathedral. Gazing upon his “Bush
Road ” —wherein the laws of reflection are treated
with singular originality—one is irresistibly re-
minded of Charles Keene’s two mechanics in the
pibture gallery. “ They do say, Bill,” said one to
hiS mate, “that the paint on some o’ these’ere
pipters comes to a matter of five pun’—let alone
the man’s time o’ layin’ it on.”
Mr. James R. Jackson exhibits a young lady in
an advanced stage of erysipelas, and pretends that
“ The End of the Story ”is its title. But this is
only idle subterfuge or forgetfulness on his part,
fot the picture is a clear and admirable rendering
of 1 “What I looked like Before I took your Miracu-
lous Remedy.” Mr. A.'J. Fischer has carelessly
exhibited a painting of a desolate woman carrying
pumpkins through a highly unfinished landscape.
It is called “On the Land,” The effect of this
picture on an intending immigrant would be
disastrous.
There has always been a mystery surrounding
the periodic disappearances of Dan 0 Connor.
But Datillo Rubbo’s “ Wayfarer ” seems to have
solved it. Here we have the unmistakable Daniel
resting by the roadside bearing in his hands a
violin anil bow. History reminds us that the
hirsute Dan once slew the innocent calf for a
livelihood, but is discreetly silent upon any
musical accomplishment. This deficiency has been
supplied by Mr. Rubbo, and it will always
pleasure our fancy to image Daniel, the peerless
knight of the whisker and St. Gscrge, strolling
between tavern and tavern, and scratching up a
jig for the edification of his stomach.
Coming later on to No. 79, by the same artist,
we find Dan has a job house-painting; so, having
recast our former theory, we conclude he is earn-
ing a poor but honest living as an artist’s model,
Mr. James A. Crisp still aspires to good
society, but his subjects are tailored by the Mont
de Piete, and would be more at home in the
kitchen. This artist also exhibits a portrait of
O. C. Cabot; and, cruel as the statement may
seem, it is like him.
A couple of Norman Carter’s sketches—“ The
Rainbow” particularly—are charming; but his
wine-press is so heavy in treatment that it seems a
species of miracle it doesn’t fall out of the frame,
Our old friend, Mr. A. J. Daplyn, still has the com-
age to exhibit, though he has upon his conscience
notwithstanding that notable Work entitled
“Landscape Painting ill Australia.”
Incidentally there is some excellent work shown
by B. E. Minns, Arthur Burgess, Will Ashton,
James F, Scott, and Miss Dorothy I,Stepheh,
By the “ Oldest Inhabitant ” !
An Obituary hotice on Saturday recalls A Sydney
native and old identity dead some years. It read: “On
August 28, at her mother’s residence, EUaray, Macleay-
Street, Caroline Jane, seconddaugliter of the late Benjamin
Palmer.” “ Ben Palmefr,” in the year 1850, kept the
Swan with Two Necks, on the southern corner of George
and Park streets, and a couple of years afterwards had
the Liverpool Arms, on the south-western corner of King
and Pitt streets, a house known earlier as the Black
Boy. In 1867 Mr. Palmer retired from business, and
in 1870 succeeded Alfred Bradford, of the Blind
Be<r«-ar pub in Oxford-street, as alderman for Bris-
bane Ward. lie was mayor in 1875 and 1876, While
in the Liverpool Anns he Used a token, Copper
coin being scarce. On one side was the lyre bird, With a
branch in its beak and “ Liverpool Anns” ; on the other,
“ B. Palmer, Pitt and King streets, Sydney, Wholesale
Wine arid Spirit Depfit.” The most notable thing about
this obituary is that it shows for the hundredth time the
impossibility of writing about any old Sydney identity
without at'least three public-houses crawling into the
narrative.

“ There’s a Reason ”
Postum Cereal Co., Ltd., Battle Creek, Mich., U.S.A.
A pioneer Australian confectioner was
David MaePherson Robertson, who died at Fitz-
roy (Vic.) the other day. All over Australia the
youngsters chew “Mac Robertson’s” sweets.
The late Jollyist was born at Monte Video (South
America) in 1834, and arrived in Victoria by the
ship Oliver Cromwell when 20 years of age. The
goldfields proving deceitful, he followed his trade
as a builder for a time. In 1882 he started with
£100 capital in a little building in Argyle-street,
Fitzroy, making boiled lollies in a copper pan.
He was his own salesman and his own everything.
Industry, skill and enterprise brought their
reward, and Mac Robertson died the head of the
biggest confectionery business in Australia. He
employed 800 hands, and sold his stuff every-
where. Business was Mac’s hobby, and his pride
was to equip his factory with up-to-date plant.
There is money in stickjaw, as Stedman, of
Sydney, also proved.
In view of recent happenings, this circu-
lar, dated only five months back, has a certain
pathetic interest:—
Department of Public Works,
Sydney, 2nd April, 1909.
Sir, —In response to the wave of patriotic feeling in
connection with the National Naval position, and to assist
in the furtherance of the proposals of the Lord Mayor of
Sydney to raise £250,000 towards an Australian Dread-
nought Fund, a meeting of the officers of the Department
was held on the 30th March in the Executive Council
Chamber, presided over by Mr. W. J. Hanna, the Under-
secretary.
On the motion of Mr. W. L. Vernon, seconded by Mr.
W. Hutchinson, it was unanimously agreed that—
“This meeting of the officers of the Public Works
Department, realising that the safety of the Empire is
rapidly approaching a challenge, pledges itself, by every
individual officer present, to the utmost of his ability,
and as quickly as possible, to support by monetary con-
tribution the patriotic action proposed by the Lord
Mayor.”
In accordance with this resolution we invite you to
forward your contribution to Mr. T. R. Steel, Accountant,
at your earliest convenience, and, if possible, not later
than the 30th instant.
The occasion is one calling for a National effort and
individual sacrifice, and we have confidence that the
officers of this Department will show their interest and
enthusiasm in a very substantial manner. May we
suggest that a possible average of a aau’s pay might be
subscribed (!)
We remain, yours sincerely,
(Signed) W. L. Vernon,
Government Architect (Secretary).
(Signed) T. R. Steel,
Accountant (Treasurer).
And this wretched thing was sent out even to
officials who were struggling to maintain a wife
and three children on £150 a year. Now
that the idea of giving Britain a Dread-
nought is wholly abandoned, how do W.
L. Vernon and T. R. Steel view the idea
of returning the subscriptions? The subscrip-
tions were given to these• persons for a specific
purpose, and if they are used for some other
purpose how can anybody be expected to trust
W. L. Vernon and T. R. Steel with money again ?
One of the certain results of the recent heavy
rain in Victoria and southern N.S.W. will be an outbreak
of pleuro-pneumonia among cattle. Unless this is
checked, it is going to hit the farmer harder than did the
floods; for, once the disease is contracted, there is no
cure. But there is balm in Gilead, for, although pleuro
cannot be cured, it can be warded off—prevented in fact
—by vaccination with the Pasteur vaccine. The cattle
must be inoculated early, as the preventive action takes
from 14 to 21 days to develop. Also, it is necessary that
the vaccine should be free from all other germs, and
where the virus is taken from another beast it may be of
a tuberculous nature or otherwise infected. Virus should
be obtained from a laboratory, and one of the best on the
market is Ray’s Australian-made vaccine, distributed by
Donald Ross and Co., of Angel Place, Sydney ; and by
Dalgety’s Limited in Queensland.*
The Welsbach Light Co. last week invited a
number of citizens to have a look round its new premises
at 302 Pitt-street, Sydney, and see how gas mantles are
made. Next to a reputation, the gas mantle is the most
delicate thing known to Science, and the prospect of
seeing exactly how it was produced was not to be missed.
There are sixteen or more operations involved in the
manufacture a mantle, but the description of the various
processes may be compressed as followsThe framework
of the mantle is knitted or woven from thin, silk-like
fibre, which, after being thoroughly cleansed, is impreg-
nated with a solution containing rare earths. After being
dried, the fibre framework of the mantle is burnt away,
and the rare earths stand alone like the deserted heroine
in the Bilanderson drama. The Welsbach people started to
make mantles away back in 1893 with a staff of two ; since
that time, 16 years ago, they have had to look four times
for more elbow room. In the new building they have
22,400 square feet, and a staff of 70 ; and there is no cer-
tainty that further prosperity won’t drive the co. forth
again some time in the future. It is an exhilarating
record of continued progress, with which, no doubt, Pro-
tection has had something to do.*

WHAT IS CATARRH?
CATARRH is inflammation of the lining
membrane of the nose and adjoining
passages. If this inflammation is not ar-
rested it invades the passages which lead
from the nose to the head, ears, throat and
lungs. It injures the sight and hearing,
destroys the sense of taste and smell, ren-
ders the breath offensive, breaks down
the affected tissues, and consumes the
nasal cartilages. The discharge, passing
through the lungs and stomach, causes
dyspepsia, also consumption. Do you
want relief and cure? If. so,, try our
great remedy.

SPORTING
NOTIONS
The row in the Sydney Rugby world is interest-
ing, humorous in spots, but full of danger for both
branches of the sport. Curiously enough, it dates back
to the beginning of the upheaval that nearly destroyed
cricket in Australia. Two years ago a number of gentle-
men thought they saw a chance of placing cricket on a
money basis. They and the Melbourne Cricket Club
made a determined effort to grab control of the summer
game with a view to running it on commercial lines.
And it was not till after two years’ hard battling that the
attempt was smashed by the Board of Control, thanks
largely to the fighting spirit of the militant secretary,
William Percy McElhone. While cricket was thus being
attacked, some of the brilliant gentlemen mixed up in
that venture discovered that there was considerable dis-
satisfaction among footballers over the allowances for loss
of time and the absence of any proper fund from which
injured players could draw assistance while laid
up. The Union’s affiliation with the degenerate
and antiquated Englisn Rugby Union made reform
impossible. Messrs. Giltinan and Trumper raised
the standard of revolt. Like Mokanna, they prated
of a reign of beneficence. Players were to receive
more decent remuneration for loss of time, and a sick
and accident fund was to be established. Things were
going to lie good. In one act the Rugby kingdom was
rent in twain. The League was formed. Tne Northern
Union rules were adopted. People rolled up to see the
new game, and it caught on.
But, like Mokanna, Messrs. Giltinan, Hoyle
and Trumper failed to inaugurate the football millennium.
The League sank lower and lower, till it became a by-
word. Tne Kangaroos were sent to Britain, but not to
earn profit for the League, Exactly what terms they did
go on do not matter now. But they formed a private
syndicate, travelling under the ausp.ces of the League,
and nothing more. In Sydney things went from bad to
worse, and the timecame when, had the Rugby Union de-
clared an amnesty, the League would have been slain. The
Union (not through mercy) missed its opportunity. There
was a revolution in t e League, and Giltinan, Trumper
and Hoyle were hurled from power. The League was re-
organised, and under the skilful management of Mr. Knox
and an energetic committee began once more to make
headway. Its teams put up splendid games, but the pub-
lic took a long while to be impressed. Very slowly the
attendance grew till the All Maoris were brought over,
and then gigantic crowds swarmed along, and the League
was once more on its feet, and strong financially. Its
reorganisation had been complete. All tiaces of the
professionalism that had created such a scare were re-
moved. It was, in truth, as much an amateur body as
the Union itself; only it had a more common-sense scale
of remuneration and more benefits. Then, enter Mr. J.
Joynton Smith, sometime owner of Epping Ground, now
proprietor, or chief proprietor, of Victoria Park race-
course—a man with a genius for making money and a
knack of bringing off big- things. For some reason or
other he conceived the idea of arranging a series of
matches between the two returned football teams, the
Wallabies of the Union, and the Kangaroos of the League.
He is the sort of man who, when he wants a tiling
real badly, generally contrives to get it. As the
Union could not be won over to agree to play Leaguers,
he approached the League. Briefly, his proposal was
that the Wallabies should arrange for a series of matches
with the Kangaroos, and let the Union do what it darned
well liked. Half the proceeds should go to the South
Sydney Hospital and half to the Wallabies till the players
had received a certain amount each ; after which all
surplus should go to the hospital. The sum the Wallabies
were to receive was generally said to be ±lBOO divided
among 18 men. But that is mere rumor. The matches
were to be played under the auspices of the League,
which was to supply the ground. Negotiations were
somewhat protracted; but on Friday it leaked out that
nine of the Wallabies had signed. The Union acted
promptly. The axe fell instanter, and suspected playeis,
although the lions of their clubs, had to stand down. The
League committee by a majority ratified the agreement,
and accepted the position of sponsor for the series of
matches.
At first glance it looked like a glorious victory
for the League. The Wallabies, when the matches were
over, would be members of the League. And that was
apparently how it struck the League council—all but one
man, and that was Knox, the man who had saved
the League. He fought it tooth and nail, and at time of
writing is still doing so. More far-seeing than his con-
freres, he knew that, although the South Sydney Hospital
shed a haloround the proposal, it was straight-out pro-
fessionalism —the nefarious spirit of boodling-. If Mr.
J. J. Smith could come in and arrange matches under lhe
auspices of the League, yet from which the League would
receive not .one sixpence, excepting, perhaps, ground
rent, then others could also do so. There would be an
outbreak of syndicate matches, and although individual
players might grow fat, the League would grow thin and
the end would be chaos. And Knox is right. Wiih his
council raging at him and his secretary denouncing him
in an amazing fashion, he stuck to his guns. The
League has a Constitution and on it he stood—or
stands. The whole League must approve of this
action before it became legal ; and the sturdy fighter
gave fair warning that he would move the Courts to lay
an injunction on the money till the League, by referen-
dum, decided if it would have this thing done. If it is
wise it will not. It can take over the Wallabies and play
them against the Kangaroos ; but let the matches be
played like others, by the League for the League’s benefit.
And there current history ends.
* * * *
On Saturday the Maoris played their final game,
against a team representing Australia. It was ah excit-
ing go. Jack, the gentleman who had been trying to
collect about ±165 for the last 15 months, got rusty, and
on Saturday morning nine of the Brown team found
themselves in the office of the Sheriff, practically under
arrest by writ of ca. sa. The League gave its cheque for
the amount and redeemed it out of the takings of the gate
in the afternoon. This little incident did not dishearten the
Maoris in the slightest. They played a much better game
than they had done the week before, and went on to the
ground with their combination much polished up. So
merry a pace did they set that at half time they had a
point in hand and were leading by eight to seven ;
also they showed signs of more than holding their
own. But in the second spell Australia had the
wind behind it, and the woe of the Maori commenced.
Every rush and every passing charge they made was
blocked, an'd long soaring kicks drove them back again
and again. The Australian score crept up to 20 points.
Then Asher made a last f ffort. Shaking off one crou dof
Australians he carried another with him close to the line,
where he succeeded in passing to Haira, who scored.
Rukutai converted, and the whistle blew 7 with the final
scores 13 to 20.
* * * *
It was an afternoon of suppressed excitement
in the Union. It was known that the Council had been
swinging the axe among the stars, and there were also
rumors that South Sydney and Glebe had been “ squared.”
Then it came out that South Sydney was without four
of its best men (one injured and three “ indisposed ”) and
Newtown was short of only one, so talk of “squaring”
became an idle jest. Newtown had the previous
week, with wounded feet, climbed to the pin-
nacle, and no one dieamed that it would not
stay there at least another week, whatever
might beiide after that. But the young bloods who had
been given a chance in South Sydney were eager. It was
speed, more and yet more speed, that ctianged the fortune
of the day. Newtown’s forwards and halves were bustled
and smothered. South Sydney suffered casualties, and
had to call in third grade nien to fill the waste of battle,
but they were all equally enthusiastic. At first, it seemed
that the Newtown back division would be too clever, and,
with the wind behind it, it should have been so. But it
failed to make the most of its advantage, so at half-time
it led by only three to ml. With the wind behind it,
South Sydney went baresark, but the Newtown defence
was very solid. A penalty goal made the scores equal,
and Newtown got the back machine going again. But
nothing happened, save some hard bullocking, till South
scored a try. Newtown struggled gamely, reached the
line again and again, but was burled back every time ;
and the whistle blew with South leading by six to three.
The other match of the A Division was that
between Glebe and University. Glebe went cold-bloodedly
to inflict a severe castigation, and did it, ruthlessly, win-
ning by 27 points to five. In the B Division, Western
Suburbs walloped Balmain by 27 points to 10 ; Sydney
downed St. George by 16 to nil; Manly had the bye ; and
the heavens reeled when North Sydney broke its egg and
hatched one victory, over Eastern Suburbs (11 to 10).
The result is, of course, that Newtown has fallen off the
pinnacle and is 23 points, while Glebe and S<>uih Sydney
are in front with 24 each. University has only 14—three
points less than Sydney, which has 17 in the B Division,
and only equal to Western Suburbs. The rest don’t
matter.
* * » *
It was an exciting day all round, for in the
midst of the general earthquake something startling
happened in the Soccer world. Pyrmont was beaten by
Granville —two to nil. It was awful, incredible, and
strong men took to drink when they heard it. It did not
alter the destination of the Rawson Gup, of course ; but
it destroyed the belief in the invincibility of Pyrmont.
Pyrmont beaten by Granville was like the British Navy
overthrown by a Peruvian squadron. Glebe skied the
towel rather than meet Sydney. In the Gardiner Cup
semi-final Adanisiown downed Rozelle by two goals to
one. The result in the premiership competition is that
Pyrmont is still ahead with 27 points, Rozelle has 24, and
Granville 22.
* * * *
The Australian section will have to do some-
thing severe to Newtown, a club that seems to be
largely composed of toughs, sluggers and thugs. Play-
ing against Paddington on Saturday a number of New-
towners behaved in a most blackguardly fashion, and
three of Paddington’s best men were marked for all
manner of unfair treatment right through the match.
As usual, it did no good ; the Newtown toughs paid so
much attention to the men that they lost the ball, and
Paddington won by 96 to 38. The game was marred
by a disgraceful riot, brought about when the biggest
man in the Newtown team smacked the smallest opponent
he could find across the face. Crowds of Rugbyites,
looking on, sent up a terrific shout and rushed the
ground, and when order was restored they went off re-
marking, “ Nice sort of game they play under Australian
rules ! ” It was unfair, of course ; but the powers that be
should remember that the Australian game is on its trial
in Sydney, and that sort of ruffianism must be killed or
it will kill the game.
The other Australian match of importance was
that of Y.M.C.A. against North Shore, which the former
won by 60 points to 41. The position in the competition
is : North Sydney 48 points, Paddington 44, Y.M.C.A.
also 44, and Newtown 28.

Melbourne’s Saturday ’ball was like the weather,
bright in spots. ’Varsity’s encounter with South attracted
because the latter’s defeat would mean the loss of the
leading position ; but South took no chances. Though
the students put up a strenuous battle they were obviously
inferior in marking and handling the ball, and their
passing was too much of the happy-go-lucky description.
Also, tliej 7 hadn’t the avoirdupois of “ Skinner's hirelings,”
which article counts somewhat when it is used reck-
lessly. The fin .1 score was; South, 65 points; Uni., 39.
The Essendon-Richmond and Melbourne-’Roy concussions
were interesting because if either ot the fir.-t-named clubs
was capsized that ended its semi-final chances ; but
defeat threatened in neither case. The “Same Old”
walloped Richmond by 83 points to 39, and the Red Legs
passed an equally “dirty doing” to ’Roy-61 to 31.
’Wood dispensed a thrashing to Geelong, and Carlton
handed a like compliment to St. Kiida—77 to
32 and 79 to 33 being the respective tales thereof.
-Possibly St. Kiida may once more arise from its ashes,
even as it did two years ago ; but Geelong’s case seems
hopeless. There are large rumors around that the League
intends to dispense with Sleepy Hollow 7 next season, and
invite P’ran, ’Town or North to make the tenth club.
This would be regrettable in some aspects, as Geelong
has always borne a clean name in the football world, and
with care and practice its ’bailers might resuscitate the
club’s ancient glories—it held the Vic. premiership seven
times between ’77 and ’B7. But nowadays Geelong fails
to draw a “ gate ” worth counting-.
* * * *
The day saw the end of the first round of
Ass. games. P’ran, with 16 out of 18 possible wins, of
course stands first; Essendon, 15 wins, is second ; but
for the third and fourth places ’Scray, ’Wick, ’Town and
Brighton all stand level with 11 victories each. So it
becomes a matter of averaging the points scored for and
against during the round ; which figures, after careful
checking, give Brnnswick third place and ’Scray
fourth, ’Town being outed -by a discrepancy
equal to about 2 per cent. Of the day’s
collisions only two secured passing notice. ’Wick
put up a lively struggle against P'ran, and notched 38
points to 48, and ’Scray unaccountably lost by a point to
North—32 to 33. Quite possibly, as things have turned
out, ’Scray is-the better pleased at having lost, having
thereby to meet Essendon instead of P’ran; but in any
case it matters little, as the final is a certainty for one of
these two, with the odds on P’ran. Among other minor
obsequi's was that of the Coburg Junior team. It dis-
appeared from the season’s strife after an uproarious
contest w 7 ith North Juniors, in which it unaccountably
managed to score seven points while North was accumu-
lating 192.
* * * *
Among other items that move the casual bar-
racker to an exrra-fervid “ Blime" are the disgruntlement
of Williamstown, which considers its ’bailers have been
disqualified too frequently,- and threatens to leave the
Ass. in consequence ; and the uprearing of Richmond’s
committee, which found its players, like St. Kilda’s and
’Stray’s, wearing hats much too large for their persons.
It discarded three of them with shocking suddenness, and
warned others to wear a more modest demeanor in future.
This is merely a variation of the trouble that is always
liable to strike the club that indulges in professionalism,
veiled or open. The minority of tip-toppers looks down
patron : singly on the mediocre majority, and treats it and
the committee as if they were worms ; the team naturally
won’t work together and gets beaten ; the tip-topper,
knowing or believing he can get his price elsewhere,
wears the glassy eye and walks jauntily, and the harassed
committee has to bump him out and begin all over again
to buy or train new men.
. At its weekly.meeting the League made a
sweet exhibition of itself when considering: the P re
Saturday’s uproar between South and Essendon. 11
entl.v the League would have kept on putting its bin .
to the whole outrageous matter but for a boundary u p >
who reported a notoriously tricky Southerner for 8 e
a ’Don, the latter having a bone in his jaw broken. " ?
other condemnatory evidence was that of the ce ‘
umpire, who admitted having cautioned the accused,
and told him that if he did it again he would report him.
Twenty delegates pondered things for a space ana tne
opined that “ Umpire Roy was quite justified in reporting
Mr. Casey, and they felt that Mr. Casey had given way
to unnecessarity strenuous and questionable play, ana
that he be warned to be more careful in future.’ And ot
course MR. Casey and half a dozen other Southern
misters were just as strenuous and almost as question-
able in their play the following afternoon. But
this writer observed that umpire Roy did not
officiate at any League match the following day,
and it is an unpleasant coincidence that other
umpires who have reported players this season nave
also been unaccountably idle for some weeks aftervaids.
Considering the notorious uproariousness of South,
there is a curious suggestiveness about the gentle treat-
ment handed out to “Skinner’s hirelings” and the
drastic penalties passed on offenders from certain other
clubs. The fact that a rowdy crowd of South barraekers
was bellowing outside the League’s rooms while Casey’s,
case was being dealt with may 7 have had something to do
with the decision.

“ 0.K.” : These exhibition matches between the
youthful George Gray and Fred Lindrum (who is little
more than a youth) are undoubtedly the most interesting
displays of billiards that have ever been given. Just
now Lhe rival artists are play ing 16,000 up at Alcocks’ in
Melbourne, and at every session—afternoon or evening
from the start of the contest the room has been crowded.
Although the lad, in his belated knickers, ranks as star
performer by virtue of his phenomenal breaks, the play
of Lindrum provides the variety which is tlie salt of
entertainment. Lindrum is fairly in the way of becoming
as fine an all-round billiardist as Roberts was and
Stevenson is. His play is graceful, rapid and full of
resource, and his attainment of the utmost possible deli-
cacy in touch seems only a matter of a little more time- —
presuming that he “ plays for safety ” «lien not engaged
at the billiard table, and avoids the losing hazards of even
mild dissipation. In fact, there is no apparent reason
why young Australian Lindrum should not presently be
the world’s master in what is already the old style of
game, whilst younger Australian Gr. y goes on piling up
those mighty scores off the red ball that must make him
as much a champion over the “all-round” men as were
the spot-stroke players of old. Meanwhile the contrast
in the style of these young experts is as remarkable as the
difference in their systems of scoring. It is not only that
Lindrum is always striving to get the three balls to the
top of the table, whilst Gray’s endeavor is to be always
making hazards from baulk off the red. Their respective
stands at the table are a study in the art of suiting the
action to the stroke. Lindrum stands for all that is re-
garded as correctness in “form,” whereas young Gray
places his legs wide apart, and lias a comparatively
labored style modelled on his father’s. So now the
question arises as to whether this is not the better stand
and style for m iking the particular stroke which, when
brought to perfection, is the master stroke of the game.
Lindrum points his cue at the bottom of his ball and
strikes it low to get a “drag” on it. Gray points his
cue at the top of the ball, and strikes it seemingly above
the centre to make it travel.
In all respects the two young fellows are rival
artists, and each is admirable. The improvement in the
play of both of them since a year ago promises that they
will make a big sensation when they get to London,
where, by the way, the sustained accuracy of Gray’s
losing hazard game has to be seen ere it will be quite
believed. The possibilities of this accuracy are limited
only by the physical powersof thestriker. Inasuccessii n
of 200 and 300 shots from baulk at the red, each shot
being sufficiently hard to bring the object ball back to the
centre of table from the top cushion, the arm (as well as
the eye) is taxed in a far greater degree than if the
player were playing a delicate “ mixed ” game at the
top of the table. Gray made his world’s record break of
800 odd last week not in one innings, but in two. He
scored the first 300 or 400 points in the afternoon, and
then finished his break in the evening. And he eventually
broke down because he is only 17 years of age. Presently
he will be able to make 600 consecutive hazards —1500
points in all—at one standing. And younger players
will come along, who have practised nothing but these
middle and corner pocket strokes from their infancy,
and they will excted even Gray in the monotony of
their mechanical accuracy—unless the rules of the
game are altered to meet the new occasion. To
suggest that the stroke which was a specialty with
Melbourne Inman, and with Gray is a revelation, will
ever be barred, as the “spot” stroke and “push”
stroke were barred, is to talk nonsense. But
the new development will doubtless be met with ex-
perimental legislation. Seeing that these long runs of
“ losers” can only be obtained through the license granted
by the “ baulk,” the baulk line may be put further back
and the diameter of the semi-circle much reduced. Or,
perhaps, a new rule will require all hazards from
baulk to be made from a central spot in the baulk line.
It is certain that something will be done in that way when
the impossibility of matching all-round play against
Gray’s play is fully understood. Australia has in the past
accepted all the new rules of billiards from England.
Now, the unparalleled proficiency of an Australian boy
player is going to force another alteration in the rules <4
the English game. But surety not until he has shown
full cause and reason for it in a match with Stevenson.
He is entitled to become champion before his wings are
clipped.

The long-drawn-out contest fpr the Dunlop
Inter-Club Bike Team Premiership.of Sydney catne to an
end on Saturday last, when the final was fought out
between Western Suburbs and Balmain. It was an ideal
day and the Homebush “ circuit ” was in perfect con-
dition; so the race was a struggle in which only hard
work and superior speed told. There were no punctures
and no falls. The Western men filled the first four places,"
leaving the Bahnainers, of course, the last four. West had
only 10 points debited against it, while Balmain staggered
home under the heavy load of 26; so West takes the
Dunlop Shield for the second time, having previously
won it in 1907. If it goes in the same direction again it
stays there permanently ; and in the dim future the last
survivor will be able to raise much drink on it, for it is
valuable.
That the Bathurst to Sydney bike race will
eventuate seems probable—at least there is a bald an-
nouncement to that effect in the daily papers. It is said
that there will be about 100 entries.
Paddington (Sydney) once again tacks the
N.S.W. baseball premiership to its belt, and the Rawsori
Cup therefore falls into its grasp for ever and aye. A
long lead early in the season put the premiership beyond
doubt ; and the recent defeats by Lane Cove and Burwood
show that it was as well that the long lead was gained.

There are some awful cranks running round in
the sporting world just now. Burrows is swinging
monotonously, breaking his own records, whatever they
are. The piano-playing fiend is still on the job, and has
been joined by several other devils even worse than him-
self, in the shape of cheerful lunatics who are trying to
wear one another out at skating. At Brisbane, one Free-
man broke his own record on a wooden floor by keeping
going for 52J hours ; and no doubt he was a proud Free-
man. But the futility of it! Even while he was doing
it, his glory was going to Sheol, for a caitiff named Kaye,
at Orange, had already lasted 54 hours, and was threaten-
ing to go on for another hour and a half. A fool who
tried to keep up with Kaye dropped with sheer exhaustion.
What is wanted is a crank killer. Such an individual
would save these sort of people a lot of miserj 7 .

Sydney Sun has started a discussion as to
whether ladies should row. And the mass of the opinion
seems to be that, as it improves the figure, she should
take to the Grace Darling accomplishment for all she is
worth so long as she doesii’trow for money. It’s a quaint
notion that a woman who rows for money thereby un-
sexes herself.

N.S.W. Motor Boat Club had a race on Satur-
day last; and it was there that the Scripture was ful-
filled, for the race was not to the swift nor the prize to
him with the strong legs. Fairbanks (both I. and II.)
were missing. The Rangitira developed some-defect with
the ignition, and had to retire. The Invincible was mak-
ing things hum when a plug blew out, and Relph had to
leave off. This left only three in it —Frou Frou and Chou
Chou with 62min. each, and Swallow with 22£min. Frou
Frou won by about 35sec., with Swallow over a minute
behind. As a speed match it was lamentable.

Joe Grimm, the Man with the Iron Jaw, is
“out” again, and has left YVestralia for Sydney. All the
same, it is understood that poor old Joe’s fighting days
are over. What he is going to do for a crust is not
known, nor does anybody seem aware whether he has
any of the stuff that is known as “ spoof,” “ splosh,” and
other weird names. Presumably, he will take to “da
pea-nut.”

The V.R.C. stewards gave some interesting
examples t’other Saturday of how to'purify the Turf
by punishing the evil-doer. Firstly, the trainer and
rider of a mare name Eunice were called upon to explain
the running of that animal, and the result of the star-
chamber inquiry was the suspension of the jockey’s
license for tiro . months. Presumably the boy was con-
victed of pulling his mount, for which heinous offence he
was fined a few pounds. That is what the brief suspen-
sion of his certif. amounted to. Then jockey J. Thomas
got into trouble. Having been cautioned for riding an
“injudicious” race on Aberdeen (as though injudicious-
ness were an offence to be punished if it occurred
again) jockey J. Thomas was presently charged with
an assault on another jockey during the race for the
Welter Handicap. Whilst he and the other boy (C.
Bolton) were riding round the turn for home he struck
him over the back with his whip. Bolton showed the
whip mark to the stewards, who thereupon disqualified
J. Thomas—for six months. For the period of half a year
the turf will be purified of a jockey who conspicuously
refrains from belting his moke in one race, but is unable
to refrain from belting a rival artist in the next race.
The character of jockeys in general, these degenerate
times, can be estimated from what happened to J.
Thomas. Evidently the stewards didn’t reckon him much
below the average, or they would have wiped him off
their books.

“ D.” gives a late Sydney physician a send-
off :
Dr. Philip Muskett was an almost fanatical believer in
the virtues of drink. He held that the imbibition of
much fluid—preferably water, and hot at that if the im-
biber could manage to get it down—was the nearest thing
going to a general panacea for every bodily ill. He
prescribed water-drinking for all sorts of com-
plaints, from plain dyspepsia and spots before the
eyes to chronic rheumatism. In his view', more
people died from too little liquid sustenance
than too much, and I have heard him advance
the cheering theory that that man w 7 as likely to
do better for himself, physically speaking, who polished
off half a dozen whiskies and sodas per diem than he who
flushed out his interior with nought but a couple of half
pints of tea or soft stuff between the rising of the sun and
the setting thereof—and deceased was no advocate for
alcohol either. His own trouble—a grievously weak
heart —was one that no diet regime could touch.
The Victorian floods did some curious
tricks. At one place near Laanecoorie the only
thing visible above water was the topmost sign of
the local store, on which appeared in bold letters
the legend, “Dry Goods.” At Horsham the fire-
brigade was prevented by the floods from reaching
a blazing timber yard in order to pour water on
it. At Ballarat citizens could not go for their
customary morning swim, the nearest public
baths being under water. Rescuers coming to a
hotel at Maribyrnong on the Sunday found the
floods up to the balcony, on which was a water-
logged party, one member of which was reciting
“ Water, water everywhere, but not a drop to
drink.” At Geelong a soap work was washed
away, and at Bridgewater one large, industrious
female was discovered on the roof of a shed sur-
rounded by 9ft. of water, busy on the week’s wash.
An obituary, by “ Bails ” :
In the midst of the Australian cricket success in Eng-
land, Jack Conway, inventor of it all, has passed away at
Frankston (Vic.). Doubtless 32 years ago there was a
simmer in the cricketing mind that a team would be sent
some day ; but Jack was the Columbus who balanced the
egg on end. He had more belief in Gregory, Spofforth,
Murdoch, Boyle, Blackham, and so forth than those
fellows had in themselves. The general verdict was that
it was a harum-scarum idea, and just like Conway. Yet
Conway pushed it through. He first came into notice
about 1862, as a phenomenal bowling colt with the Mel-
bourne Cricket Club—a forerunner of Spofforth the
demon. Afterwards he became a sporting writer, and
worked for the Age and the Leader. Then he started a
weekly called Town Talk, with Garnet Walch and R. P.
Whitworth ; but the three were too much alike —they
lacked business ballast. Jack was, you may say, the
literary parent of “ Felix ” Horan, on the Australasian,
and “ Mid On ” Hedley, of the Leader,.

“ S.S.” : If by any chance tlie Old-Age Pension
had to be battled through the Vic. State Parliament again
most of the Portly persons who resisted it tooth and tail
would be found offering it benevolent aid, and the House
of Elderly Landlords would embrace it without a murmur.
In fact, the pension has proved to be a boon and a blessing
to Property. It is a valuable guarantee of rent. For-
merly the landlord had to take his chance of poorer
te' ants skipping by the dark of the moon with the house,
hold furniture on a fish barrow ; now, in the majority of
such families there is an old-age pensioner, and in eight
cases out of a dozen the pension is ear-marked for rent
On pension pay day I have noticed a little knot of land-
lords of the prowling sort, who are always creeping round
their property to see that the tenant’s children don’t bite
the fences—have seen them hanging upon the wall of the
distributing centre in my neighborhood, waiting to de-
scend upon the pensioners as they leave with the money.
Agents tell me that rents are now very reliable in the
poorer suburbs, even though they have gone up as a
result of the pension. All booms gravitate to the land-
lord.

From A. J. Brierley, speaking for the Oriental
Timber Corporation: “Re par (13. 5/8/’O9) to the effect
that the co. merely cuts up imported logs in Australia,
the fact is that the co. will, with the aid of the most up-
to-date mill in the Commonwealth, and by employing
skilled labor, manufacture flooring-and lining boards and
mouldings to compete with the imported Baltic. The co.
does not compete with the Tasmanian mills referred to
by The Bulletin, in the first place because it has not yet
commenced its business, and in the second been use the
two timbers are quite different, the Tasmanian being
hardwood, whilst the Siheriari is soft pine.”
The made-in-Australia tree keeps on growing.
It, wasn’t, so long- ago that even the ntan who reckoned
himself a good Australian didn’t, as a rule, care tuppence
where he got his hit of fire • insurance; but to-day,
within the Sydney Metropolitan Fire Brigades’ district,
an Australian co. stands at the head of the list in the
matter of total business (that is, total risks), another
Australian office stands second, and though a venerable
English office stands third, still another Australian office
stands fourth. For all that, Australia has a long way to
go yet before it gets a reasonable distance along the right
road—there are 23 offices holding over £1,000,000
of Sydney and suburban risks, and only nine of
those 23 belong to Australia or Maoriland. The
other 14 make a heap of money, no doubt —if they didn’t
they wouldn’t stay here-g-bu't it is the foreign share-
holder who pockets it. And, after all, that is only
another way of borrowing money. The main difference
between that and the ordinary way is that the foreigner
keeps his own hand on the principal, and makes us pay
interest on it.

Of all the. mechanical rogues which cheat the
public while pretending to live solely for the purpose of
giving it fair measure, the steelyard seems to be the
worst. The awkward contraption fortunately isn’t in
very general use, though you can bump against it often
in carcase shops and sometimes in produce stores ; but
when it does get a chance it is usually a, thief. During
last year the owners of 48 of these ; villains brought
them up for “verification ” at the Sydney Weights and
Measures office, and 13 of them were branded “Judas”
and cast out. The spring balance, which is commoner, is
nearly' as bad : no less than 138 out of 631 were rejected
—l3B thieves that had been wanderidg round mostly' in
Ah Sin’s fruit and vegetable baskets, and supplying one
reason why Ah Sin can sell hispumpkih at a ha’penny a
pound less than the white hawker with the moderately-
respectable counter-scales fixed in his cart.

“San Remo’’ : The Commonwealth Commerce
Act is fast becoming a deceased letter. I understand
that, under this Act, woollen goods that are pure wool
may be branded “ All Wool ” ; also that goods made of a
mixture of wool and cotton are to be branded “ Wool and
Cotton.” Writer has been in the rag,trade for 20 years,
and reckons he knows wool when he sees it or feels it;
hut a lot of the imported stuff now going on the market
is shaking his confidence in his ability' to detect the
sheep’s overcoat. I’ve sold and seen sold imported under-
clothing branded “ All Wool ” or “Pure Wool,” and if the
brand didn’t lie, then my lengthy' experience-has taught
me nothing. Which lam loth to believe. A fot of mix-
ture underclothing is coming through the Customs with-
out any descriptive marks upon either articles or parcel.
And more is coming in with the description “Wool and
Cotton ” on the outside of the package, and misleading
remarks on the article of wear itself. When an imported
singlet that looks and feels like wool isn’t actually
branded “ All Wool,” you can bet y'our final half-crown
that it isn’t the undiluted product of the sheep’s back.
And even when it is branded “ All Wool,” there is still a
good chance that some of it came from the cotton fields
of Ole Virginny. An undergarment of wool and cotton
made up to look like natural wool has a trade device
stamped upon it. Amid a mass of information —“Eng-
lish-made,” “British-made,” and such-like whoops—
something like “ Guaranteed,” or “ Warranted,” or “All
Pure-Unshrinkable,” stand out prominently. And the
buying public, being in the main careless, takfe this as a
sufficient endorsement of the counter hand’s recom-
mendation. Of course the being whom the morning
paper calls an Ambassador of Commerce has a soul above
dishonesty'; but, all the same, the shopman who tried to
get to Heaven by telling the truth about the boss’s goods
would certainly never rise as far ns the manager’s chair.
Yet, another wriggle consists of having “ All Wool ”
stamped in big letters, and “ and cotton ” in remarkably
small ones. As an incurable Empire Da.vist, I grieve to
sa.v the Englishman is the worst brigand of the bunch.
Whether it is that foreign competition has got him with
his back against the wall, or whether it is a revival in
another and more furtive form of the sturdy bucca-
neering spirit of Elizabeth’s da.v, I can’t say. Kingston
used to send the swindling importer to the police courts ;
but, nowadays, the fraudulent ambassador is treated
almost with deference. Usually, “ the case is referred to
the Minister.” Not long ago, a certain Brisbane importer
had his case “ referred,” and a painless extraction fine of
£5 was the small, unobtrusive result. The same ambas-
sador, some y'ears before, had done a sentence of six
months’ hard under the old State laws for defrauding the
Customs. On that occasion he imported a case of con-
certinas, which instruments, on being examined, were
found to be stuffed with watches and jewellery'. If he.is
caught ag-dn he mnv g°f an hlmuinated ncHrocc.
LARKS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Up in the sky
The larks sing. Hark!
They greet the sun ;
And so would I
Were I a lark,
Or up to one.
The falling dew
Upon their bills
Shines bright; and yet
In heaven’s blue
Their glad song trills;
They fear no debt.
Worse case is mine.
My heart Care fills;
My earth is blue,
And I repine,
For all my bills
Are falling due.
Alas ! that I
Am not a lark !
To meet the sun
Swift would I fly
Whilst it was dark ;
And ev’ry dun
Would come and find
The bird had flown.
They might condemn
My flight; for mind,
'i'would be, I own,
No lark to them.
Though I would love
To fly the blue,
It cannot be:
Larks fly above
The falling-due,
It falls on me.

HEN Theodore Roosevelt set out on his much-advertised Bigf Game Hunting Expedition through Af rim ho tnnt the
most extraordinary precautions to become a private person. But the world's press would not let him. And his
own remarkable personality and his affinity for adventure kept him unwillingly in the lime-light. The result was
a sensational bidding for the rights of his articles upon his tour, which gave him the highest price yet paid to an
author—the amazing price of one dollar a word. Naturally, Roosevelt is keeping his information to himself.
From Nairobi, on May 25, he sent out the following statement : —
"No newspaper has a representative with the Roosevelt party, nor any nearer means of
of the party's doings beyond what is generally known. Any special despatches appearing
probability sheer inventions. Moreover, the details which purport to be thus obtained can
bribery, and it is safe to state that a dishonorable man giving a bribe and a dishonorable
same would be willing to invent untruths for money, or traffic in other forms of dishonor."

The Queensland Election.
Queensland finds it necessary to make another
sacrifice to the silly 7 fetich of Party Government
by having a dissolution and a general election,
this will make the third general election inside
2A years, and there is no assurance that it won’t
leave things so exactly as they are as to necessi-
tate three more elections inside the next 18
months. Since April, 1907, there has been no-
thing in Queensland politics save elections, dis-
solutions, long recesses filled with intrigue, short
sessions devoted to stonewalls, censure motions,
recrimination, treachery and the neglect of the
country’s work. The whole 2J years have been a
scramble to decide who will have the portfolios
and be paid to leave the community’s affairs un-
attended to. The Phidston coalition can’t get on
because its majority of one is insufficient; the Labor
party can’t get in because its minority of one is still
more insufficient. And yet the great incontro-
vertible fact sticks out that, no matter how many
parties there may be in a House, or how venomous
the parties may be, yet for every Bill, clause,
motion, amendment, or proposition of any kind
whatsoever that can be brought forward, there
must be a majority—even if it is only that of the
Speaker’s casting vote—on one side or another,
and if the daily, hourly scramble for the pre-
carious portfolio were abolished, there is never
anything to prevent the business of the country
going on. The simple, efficient, obvious system
of electing the Ministry at the beginning of a new
Parliament with a three-years’ tenure of office,
and of letting its measures be judged on
their merits, the same as any private mem-
ber’s measures, would at least make for
honesty and progress. It would abolish
penal dissolutions, premature general elections,
motions of censure, Fusions, stonewallings, sordid
bargainings by which a Kidston sells his political
principles to a Philp in order that Philp may help
him to keep his job, and all such calamities. The
Ministry which was elected at the beginning of a
Parliament would have nothing more to hope or
fear or to gain or lose from that Parliament. It
would have no need and no inducement to intrigue,
to lobby, to Fuse, to bargain, to coalesce, to boodle,
to log-roll or to buy a corrupt majority. All it
could do would be to endeavor to so please the
country that the country, when it elected the
next Parliament, would return members who were
prepared to appoint the Premier and his colleagues
for another term. The public recognises that
when the agricultural tenant has no fixity of
tenure it makes for rack-renting and bad farming ;
that a Judge who can be sacked at a moment’s
notice is a corrupt creature making hay while the
sun shines ; that a civil servant, a bishop, a rector,
a railway commissioner, and all manner of other
people should have some guarantee against the
instantaneous and wholly capricious “sack.” It
doesn’t allow even the tenant of a two-roomed
house to be discharged suddenly for no special
reason, and his furniture put out on the pavement
there and then. And why it hasn’t noticed the
same point about Ministers of State, Heaven only
knows.
■*■***.
The Party system is the vilest engine of corrup-
tion and demoralisation in the whole domain of
our politics. When there are (say) three parties
in a House, that signifies that there are three sets
of opinions. Of course there are points on which
the first party holds the same views as the second,
and points on which it holds the same views as
the third, and the second and third also agree
on some things ; but no two agree on all things.
There is a distinct majority one way or the Other
for every measure, but there isn’t a majority
for any one leader. Yet the Party Government
folly says that there must be a distinct majority
for one leader and for one whole policy, though
the thing is plainly impossible. So either Parlia-
mentary Government must be abandoned or else
two parties must agree, disreputably, falsely and
for the sake of office, to sacrifice! enough of their
honest beliefs to make a dishonest union possible.
And here the most nefarious feature of all comes
in. If there are three parties they must always
be these three and no others :
(1) The Most Honest Party.
(2) The Less Honest Party.
(3) The Least Honest Party.
I he Most Honest Party generally refuses to give
away any of its principles, yet unless it does so, or
unless some other party does so. Parliamentary
Government is impossible under the Party system,
and the whole Parliamentary system must close up.
Therefore its negotiations with the Less Honest
Party (it can’t negotiate with the Least Honest
Party) are apt to come to nothing. So the bulk
of the Less Honest Party, which under happier
conditions might have improved, takes the easy
road of demoralisation, and coalesces with the
Least Honest Party, and the result is the Least
Honest Government. It is almost always the
same result. The wretched Party system makes
coalitions imperative, and the Less Honest Party
and the Least Honest Party are the two which
come together most readily. As a means of pro-
viding the worst kind of Government which can
be found, the Party system is unrivalled. It
either provides a Deakin-Cook Fusion which
does bad things, or a Kid-Philp Fusion which
does nothing at all.
The one plea advanced for the Party system is
that it has worked fairly well in Britain for
the period— not a very long one—during which it
has lasted. But a British Parliament is elected for
seven years. By the time it comes to an end the
people are generally so disgusted with the
crowd in power that they give the other crowd a
good working majority. Thus in 1900 Britain
gave the Tory Unionists 134 majority, and in 1905
it slewed round and gave the Liberals 354 majority.
That vast, wholesale, hysterical tendency to turn
the popular coat has hitherto made the Party
system more or less workable in Britain. Here
the nation has never got into the habit of regu-
larly changing sides in this large fashion, and for
that very commendable reason the Party method
has utterly broken down.
QUEENSLAND GOSSIP.
Brisbane, August 28, 1909.
My Dear Thargomindah.—
Having got rid of the Eisteddfod talent, the
Musical Board did its annual prize distribution.
The event befell on Tuesday evening, and the
Countess transpired in a girlish white frock and a
single rope of pearls, and handed out the paste-
boards. There was a short programme of infant
phenomena, in which Mrs. Dudley took a very
friendly interest; in fact, there was a touch
of the happy mother about her . handling
of timid Eileen Beattie and her fiddle. Dr
and Mrs. Robert Thompson captured the visitor
in the vestibule, and held her fast while daughter
Aileen weighted her down with 61b. of fragrant
dark violets. Ex-Speaker Cowley and his popular
wife were there, and the former filled the shoes of
absent chairman E. B. Forrest. That gentleman,
being the Government’s majority of one, had to
remain at Parliament House to shore up the
tottering throne of King Kidston I.
The home-going of the Dudleys took place this
afternoon in the presence of a select few. The
larger portion of the population had gone to the
inter-State lacrosse match, wherein the light blues
suffered a severe defeat from our men in red.
But to return to the departing guests. They'
were speeded by a guard of honor of the gay
Moretons in their best Sunday clothes; also by
the Lieutenant-Governor and his wife, most of
the evaporating Ministry, the Mayor and
Mayoress, and the ladies who belong to the
naval and military commandants. The special
pulled out to the tune of “Gor Save.”
On arrival at the rather unpicturesque Pinkenba
the Naval boys were seen, looking very correct in
their gladdest rags. The Commandant’s pet
Dreadnought lay in the offing. The band blared
the same old tune. Mrs. Dudley had upon her
arm the basket of violets and Queensland ostrich
feather orchids handed her by Mayoress Wilson,
and she wore the frock of Assam silk and the hat
in need of repair in which she visited the
Children’s Hospital. Mrs. Hore-Rnthven was a
picture in grey, with a purple hat. When the
hand-shaking was over (John Forrest right in the
stage centre) and the big boat pulled out,
the local Dreadnought exploded with the row
which is usual on such occasions.
There was a tea on board the Otway on Friday,
and some 300 of the roof and summit of local
society drank in the big saloon, and wandered up-
stairs and downstairs and into my lady’s cham-
bers. They also invaded the electrically-fitted
laundry, and declared that with such aids Merely
Sarah Jane would soon become a glut in the
market. Quite a host of notables had booked by
the big ship, including the Earl and his Countess
and their bodyguard; Mrs. Craig, who returns
from among us to join her husband at the Aus-
tralia-ill Sydney; and a lady missionary, who leaves
us after six months’ rest cure, to fish for the souls
of Chunder Sen and Muggama Chuddy and Shik-
kamy Shaster, at Calcutta.
The Parliamentary ladies’ gallery has been
packed these long exciting days of the majority of
one. The annoying regulation which necessitated
the sending of a card to the Speaker—a silly rule
made by the late John Leahy—appears to have
been done away with. The only purpose it ever
served was that of angering the Backblocks lady
who didn’t own a card.
Mrs. Kidston was there on Tuesday to see
William sky the political towel, which he did in
only a qualified way—he seems to have lost the
power of doing anything straight out and vigorous
nowadays—and the whole of the Ministerial ladies
were in support, with the exception of Mrs.
Treasurer Hawthorne and Mrs. Joey. The latter
has abandoned the gallery since her husband
became Speaker.
An event of the week was the unadvertised and
unostentatious joining of Audrey, the youngest
and prettiest daughter of the late E. R. Drury (of
Q. N. Bank fame), and the onh' son of Mr. arid
Mrs. C. A. Clarke, of this city. The event hap-
pened in the much-decorated St. Michael’s and
All Angels, and the Rev. W. Thompson per-
formed. The bridal gown of white crepe sported
some yards and a fichu of lovely Limerick lace,
brought out by Dicky for his bride when he
visited “ ITrope ” last year.
Two brides soon-to-be are Miss Nellie Callan
(her father was a lucky Mount Morgan plunger,
and the daughter’s hair matches the gold won
from the wonderful hill), and Miss Annie Mac-
donald. daughter of a Government official. Miss
Callan’s future is an apple farmer in Tasmania.
Miss Macdonald goes into the Maoriland Loan
and Mercantile business with Mr. C. 0. Mant.
These two young women have to date consumed
!)G wedding teas, at which handkerchiefs, doyleys,
and kitchen crockery have descended upon them
like the waters that go down at Lodore.
For complete lack of tact commend me to the
committee folk of the Sick Children’s Hos-
pital. They laid the foundation-stone of their
long-talked-of diphtheria Ward on Monday, and
the Dudley family did the deed. Having allowed
a certain daily paper to collect some £3OOO for
the work, and having permitted the Mayoress and
her assistants to stand neglected in the wet for a
day and a half in a futile effort for an additional
£BOO, these committee persons agreed to call
the ward after the beneficent paper and
to publicly thank the workers. But in the
fluster of greeting the Countess they forget these
little matters. They just sat down and purred
when his Ex. said how hard the committee had
slaved for the noble object, and the people who
had really slaved got never a mention. Thereupon
the paper arose hi its wrath and smote them
heavily, and the f§te workers stood up as one
woman and departed without tea.
Touching the 36 hours political situation.
Supply was driven through by the aid of about 16
closures and 46 divisions (they panned out each
time with the same old majority of one) and some
rather strange doings by Joey Bell in the chair.
In the midst of the turmoil the Premier had a
birthday, and his party gave him a presentation.
As an outcome of this great disturbance, the
new Queensland party presented a memorial to
Arthur Morgan, praying that, as there is every
likelihood of a Bowman-Blair combine with a
decent working majority, the country might be
spared the expense of another election. But the
Kidphilp party doesn’t want anything like this,
and the heathen in his blindness is not at all likely
to hearken to the voice of wisdom either. So a
general election will, I suppose, be.the order of
the day. The trouble has been too much for
Labor-leader Bowman, whose attack of asthma on
Friday robbed'the fight of much of its effect-
iveness.
Sincerely yours,
MABIO.
PASSED WITH HONORS.
“You musn't think every Tom , Dick and Harry can kiss me.”
“Of course not . But my name is Jim.”
Australasia has a new draughts champion
—J. A. Boreham, of Maoriland—in succession to
Robert Marr, who died in Brisbane last Decem-
ber. Marr held the championship of the fast and
furious game for over 17 years. Among those
who met in Brisbane recently to settle the tre-
mendous matter was Warnock, from whom Marr
won the title ; but youth will be served, and the
aged one went down winded in the blankth round.
The man who humps Matilda is not in it
with the old prospector who dropped his wheel-
barrow at a store in Charters Towers t’other week
and loaded up for a run to Luckv Creek, 150
miles further on. His load included two 501 b.
bags of hour, 71b. tobacco, six tins treacle, some
pickled sheep, a 6xB tent, pick and shovel, and
prospecting outfit. The old chap—he’s 60—said
he’d had Lucky Creek marked down for a trial
this good bit, and he reckoned he’d better buck in
to it while he was still youngand vigorous.
Died at Gympie on August 22, John
Flood, one of the last of the Irish political exiles
to Australia. He tramped the Inky Way in Ire-
land, and his writings got him sent out here. He
settled at Cooktown and became editor of the
local Courier. Subsequently, in the late ’seven-
ties and early ’eighties, he was on the Brisbane
Courier, but gave up his billet to become secre-
tary to Perkins and Co., the brewers. About 25
years ago he went to Gympie, where he carried
on business as a mining secretary till Death served
a final call notice on himself.
Townsville had a plebiscite the other day,
and selected O. J. Fenwick to stand with Philip
at the next State election, P. F. Hanran having
decided not to stand any more. Out of
1131 votes Fenwick secured a majority of 11 over
G. H. Pritchard, the secretary of the Australian
Sugar Producers’ Association—the concern which
the C.S.R. spoon-feeds. For years past Hanran
has been as silent as the grave, which no doubt
suggested Fenwick as a suitable successor. He is
Townsville’s local tombstone-maker.
“ Myrtle ” : Barcaldine, in the west, cele-
brated Bananaland’s Jubilee by making a huge
bonfire of most of its only street. With no water
supply and a big breeze the blaze ate up things
gaily. Longreach, a little further west, also has
the habit of burning itself out occasionally. The
record of the two towns is two big blazes each,
and all four fires have left these people of the
plains mostly in their night-shirts. Longreach
g ‘ts down at times to 4Jin. of rain in a year, and it
)mi t a good place to deviate a transcontinental
railway through.
Queensland got a shock on Monday morn-
ing when it read that Alex. Steuart, chief in-
spector of the Q. N. Bank, had been found with a
revolver bv his side and a fatal wound in his head.
He had evidently taken no chances : he had stood
in front of a mirror to do it. For 20 years he
was one of the bank’s chief officers. In the
Q.N. s wild days there were three of much the
same name connected with it—Stewart, Stuart,
and Steuart. Stewart, on one occasion, being
called on for a report, bluntly estimated a
loss of £275,000 on one account. The mag-
nificent Drury, then general manager, just as
bluntly minuted the report, “This is absurd.”
But it wasn t. That Stewart died before the
crisis came. Stuart, who had been manager at the
head-office, followed Drury—the man who was
supposed to have died at sea ; but he was super-
seded. The third, Steuart, who had been sub-
inspector, was appointed inspector; and for 15
years he and General-Manager Ralston have been
pulling the wreck out of the mud. Had he stood
in front of the mirror 10 years ago it wouldn’t
have been so surpr.sing ; but to have done it now,
with the worst of the struggle behind, is a mys-
tery which will take some clearing up.
Moon Pictures.
[FOR THE BU LLETIN.]
BEHIND you the wash of air in the moon-
blanched arch of the skies,
You, and the swing of the palm, and the
moon-mist filling my eyes ;
The narrow panes of the church, and the fall of
their orange light;
The blur of a flowering tree, and a road that is
wide and white.
A figure with drooping head, the red point of a
cigarette,
Dreams that follow the smoke-wreath encircling
your silhouette,
The shadow of lattice-work, a balcony over the
street,
Buds in an unseen garden, sweet as things hid are
sweet. ...
Behind you the wash of air, and the moon-pearled
lift of the skies —
You and your dear dark head that is filling my
heart and eyes. . . .
Two wav’ring dusky figures that are trysting
down in the street.
A heart in darkness beating till I think you must
hear it beat,
The sound of slow bells chiming, and the wind
through the pinang trees,
Star-boats that drift in splendor to the rim of the
ether-seas. . . .
The drone of the preacher’s voice, and the organ
solemn and low—
And you have forgotten me . . . painting pictures
from Long Ago!

THE LURE OF GOLD.—VI.
By J. D. FITZ GERALD. Barrister-at-Law.
One of the glories of Queensland is Charters
Towers. The field was the largest producer of
gold in Queensland in the year 1907, with 175,552
ounces, valued at £702,208. With this magnificent
return the Towers left the great Mount Morgan
behind by 29,778 ounces. Since the discovery of
the field, Charters Towers (with the Cape River
returns included) has.yielded the wonderful amount
of 5,647,938 ounces, worth £22,591,752. We have
here a field which, while it has nope of the
mysterious charm of Mount Morgan, has sur-

passqd that mine in its output, and even to-day,
as a gold-producer, can show a clean pair of heels
to the Golden Mount. But the Mount proceeds
to ride two horses, Copper and Gold, and the com-
bination gives it precedence in value of ore raised.
The Towers was the scene of all the romantic
glamor of the early goldfields. It was no acci-
dental discovery, but was the result of the faith
held by the earlier Queensland colonists in the
existence of great gold zones in their State,
despite the disappointment and the disaster of
Canoona ; and of the intractable (at that time)
ores of Ravenswood. The miners were positive
that gold existed in profusion - , and they never
gave up hope. Charters Towers was discovered
by prospectors who still held to their beliefs, even
on the return route from Ravenswood. The field
began with a reefing discovery, followed by allu-
vial (thus reversing the usual order of things).
The name of the local “gold warden,” Mr.
Charters, was bestowed upon the new field, and
to-day Charters Towers is a name of import to
every geologist, miner, investor, metallurgist and
process chemist from Yukon to Siberia and from
Sydney to London. Fourth in order of discovery
of the great Queensland goldfields, the Towers
soon drew adventurous men from the ends of
the earth. The procession of years has witnessed
hundreds of those strange vagaries of fortune
which have made penniless men rich beyond the
dreams of avarice, and poor again; and then
again rich.
The great gambling days have long gone by.
To-day, commercial principles rule supreme in
the exploitation of Charters Towers. Investors
know that money is used on scientific prin-
ciples. It is no mere guesswork, such as the
earlier mining ideas mainly were. Well-con-
sidered preliminary tests are followed by bold
experiment. The diamond drill probes the depth
of the earth ; the latest processes are employed ;
the geologist, the practical mine manager and
the scientific chemist are collaborators in the
work of development. There are cooler heads
plotting to wrest the hidden gold from the
secretive earth than those which, in the wild
youth of the field, threw a main with fortune
every day of their lives. The “ canvas town ”of
the pioneers has been twice replaced, once by the
wooden structures of advancing prosperity, and,
later, by the substantial stores and warehouses of
the Charters Towers of to-day. The days
of romance in connection with Charters
Towers are not quite fled; but the cautious
emigrant who to-day looks abroad for a new
abiding place will doubtless pay more attention
to the features of the Queensland goldfields which
mark stability, steady purpose in the pursuit of
development and the adoption of modern pro-
cesses, than he would to the chances of fortunes
to the few and disappointment to the many,
which were the experience of the pioneers.
But, although only the glamor of the old
romance remains, there is glorious material for

the novelist, the poet, or the descriptive writer of
the future. Why not the present? I have in-
voked the native muses throughout these.artioles.
Already some fine descriptive poetry has resulted,
notably some by E. J. Brady, which supplements
the native production of the Brunton Stephenses,
Essex Evanses, and other Queensland poets. The
ups and downs, the vicissitudes, the changes from
poverty to riches and from riches to poverty,
which have been characteristic of the Queensland
goldfields, surely must inspire the local writers
with epic zeal, either of prose or verse ! What
finer example of the “great central situation”
which the novelist seeks as the groundwork of
his narrative could be found than the story of
the obstinacy of the Charters Towers miner,
Craven, who, after much cogitation, based upon a
NO. I TUNNEL ON BRANCH RAILWAY NO. 2.—This line was built to carry the
thousands of tons of coke limestone, wood, etc., for the various treatment works of the company,
and is probably the busiest line in Queensland.

mere tyro’s knowledge of geology, but a fund of
good common-sense, came to the conclusion that
two distant lodes converged and joined at a cer-
tain spot; and who steadily pursued this idea until
it led to fortune, not only for himself, but for those
who had faith in his apparently bizarre theory ?
In this case fortune tantalised the adventurers,
for they had sunk below the level of the antici-
pated junction of the lodes, and found disappoint-
ment as their reward. But, harking back in their
search, they investigated a small and apparently
insignificant lode which had been passed on the way
down ; and lo ! it was the veritable lode which
was the object of the search. Then came fortune
for the theorist, and the proud consciousness of
having been a prophet whose predictions had
been verified in his own time. The cheques for
thousands of pounds which were the result of this
splendid coup might all have been endorsed with
the motto “I told you so ! ”
This was one of the examples of fortune's
vagaries. Another case was that of the sudden
accession to wealth by the discoverers of the St.
Patrick’s mine. One of these was a man named
Stubley. His romantic career and sad end are
recorded by Mr. Critchley Parker, in his opuscule
“ Resourceful Queensland ” :
But one of the reefs unearthed by the pioneers gradually
developed into the famous St. Patrick’s ; and the chief
interest in this was absorbed by another arrival named
Stubley. He obtained in the course of a brief moment a
nroperty which qui kly yielded him afortune of £300,000.
Leaving the district for more congenial climes—and, as
he vainly thought, for a richer sphere, where men stamp
out sovereigns with an auctioneer’s hammer and spin the
precious metal from air, in the mart and market place—
he commenced “operations” in wheat! ... A little
later a “swaggie” was found dead on the road side,
leading north-west from Charters Towers to Croydon.
The tragedy of wealth and poverty was complete. Stub-
ley had fallen by the way along which it is seldom the
fortune of any traveller to pick up more than one St.
Patrick’s reef for a song.
If any country in the world can show finer epic
material than that furnished by Stubley’s vicissi-
tudes of fortune, I should like to know where it is.
When the contention advanced in these articles
is borne in mind—viz., that the goldfields are a
magnificent backbone for an ind ustrial comm unity,
a splendid auxiliary to the wheat, the wool, the
sugar, the butter, the meat, etc., then the value
of Charters Towers to the State of Queensland
will be fully realised. Its production of gold has
been splendidly consistent since the year 1885.
Its highest productive point up to the present was
reached in 1899 with a product of 319.5720 z.,
worth £1,278,248. In 1885 the yield was 106,9810 z.
(value, approximately, £424,924). This rose in
1898 to 183,8200 z. In 1898 it was 272,3680 z. ; and
the following year was the highest. The year
1901 was the iowest for 16 years ; but that is
accounted for, not by any decline of the prospects
of the field, but partly by the fluctuation in pro-
duction which must be expected of any lode-field,
and partly by the temporary withdrawal of local
capital from mining, and its employment in other
productive channels, in consequence of the rapid
development of the resources of the State in other
ways.
As a matter of cold, hard fact, there is room for
the profitable investment of a hundred millions
sterling in the gold industry of Queensland. At
present that industry is a mere infant to what it
will be as years go on. The demands of the in-
dustry upon science are being constantly met, and
new processes are being invented which make
inferior ores—ores which are now disdainfully
overlooked on all the goldfields—payably pro-
ductive. The mining industry of to-day has
passed beyond the stage when the alluvial miner
could win comparative fortune with a pack-horse
and a pick and shovel. Though it is improbable
that the alluvial zones of the State are all dis-
covered, it is a fact that the most productive
mines are those which require capital to develop
them from the first. Lower and lower down in
the bowels of the earth, rich strata are being dis-
covered. The splendid optimism of men like
Pfeiffer, of Charters Towers, has been justified,
and in the lower levels parallel strata have proved
to be “jewellers’ shops.”
The end of the Charters Towers lodes has been
regularly predicted for years past. The mining
man is often of a mercurial temperament. There
are optimists and pessimists in the ranks of
mine managers and experts; and sometimes
both dwell in the skin of one man. Every
vaticination as to the “ petering out ” of the great
field has been falsified. In 1898 it was said that
some of the reefs which are the richest producers
to-day, were “ rapidly becoming exhausted.” As
Mr. Parker points out, the field has since then
produced gold to the value of £8,700,000. Every
day, in every mine, with each blow of the pick or
drill, in each shot that is fired, new developments
may be expected. The great Day Dawn line of
reef has proved a wonderful producer ; and wher-
ever the deeper levels have been pierced, the
enterprising companies have been rewarded. To
respectfully paraphrase Milton, it might be said
of Queensland goldfields that—
In the lowest depths, a lower deep,
Still "ff’rin<r to enrich us
Opens wide.
The warden’s report on the Towers in Sep-
tember, 1908, gives some idea of the depths of the
mines, and consequently affords some measure of
the enterprise and the optimism of those who
have invested their money in them. Here are the
records of deep sinking : —•

Here is an instance of the investors’pluck : Plant’3
Day Dawn gold mines is sinking a vertical shaft,
the depth of which is now 1223 ft. The warden’s
report states that this company expects to meet the
reef at a vertical depth of 2600 ft.
I do not say that the intending emigrant, to
whom these articles are addressed, could expect to
invest his capital, or seek employment for his
hands, in these mines. What lam contending is
that the product of the Queensland gold-fields
circulates through the veins of the industrial body
of the whole State, and acts as the white corpuscles
do in the blood towards the micro-organisms of
disease, depression and decay. The gold returns
of the State annually, in a certain degree, perform
the diagnostic function for the industrial organ-
ism which is performed by the opsonic diagnosis
of the blood in the human body. The richest
State is that in which the natural products are
most varied ; the happiest State is that in which
the occupations of the people are most diversified ;
the most progressive State is that in which the
natural talents of the citizen find scope for expan-
sion. Such a State Queensland is shown to be
surely, or these articles have been written in vain.

Continual Buzzing in Head.
FOUND A TRUE CURE
AFTER MANY FAILURES
“About twelve months ago ab-
scesses began to break out on my head
and I had running sores behind my
ears. They grew and spread and soon
a nasty discharge was continually run-
ning from them, causing fearful pain.
There was always a buzzing noise in
my head. I was under doctor’s treat-
ment for three months in vain. I also
tried several ointments, but they failed
to give me any relief. At last I thought
I would give Cuticura a trial. So I
bought a cake of Cuticura Soap, a tin
of Cuticura Ointment and a bottle of
Cuticura Pills. After using them for
about, twelve days I began to feel con-
siderably better. The discharge got
less and the abscesses began to die
away.- I no longer had the buzzing
noises in my head. By the time I had
started on my second set of the Cuti-
cura Remedies I was cured. It is
about six months since I was cured
and I have never felt the slightest sign
of the abscesses returning. I can not
give thanks enough for the good Cuti-
cura has done me. Mrs. Annie Lyles,

for in about a month I was released

This is, so far as The Bulletin knows, the only Private
Enterprise business in Australia that doesn’t pursue
dividends. The first sentence in the directors’ report
explains why : “ Our works have been in constant opera-
tion during- the past six months, thereby relieving the
Flemington yards of large surpluses of fat stock.” So
this co. cuts in when prices would otherwise sag, and the
shareholders, who are mostly big stock-owners, get the
benefit in the shape of higher prices. The doubtful
feature about the business is the subsidy, or rebate of Jd.
per lb. In return for keeping the market stiff, most of
the big men who send stock to Flemington (Sydney)allow
the co. this rebate. That is to say, if it bids £lO
it only has to actually pay' (say) £9 15s. ; but if
the public wants the beast it has to bid over the £lO,
though its competitor’s £lO really means only £9 15s.
It is through this clever bit of business that the squatters,
etc., can afford to run this co. without ever scenting a
dividend. Some other people, no doubt, benefit; for the
co. can afford to either put up better stuff or sell it at a
lower price than if it had to make 8 or 10 per cent, on its
capital. For that reason it isn't the most popular concern
imaginable even among other Australian meat-packers,
who growl that this co. has advantages which they can’t
get hold of. During the past six months the co. paid
£206,652 for sheep, cattle, and slaughtered meat, as
against £79,135 in the first half of 1908 and £36,736 in
Jan.-June, 1903 —figures which show that the co. has to
bustle these times in order to prevent the Sydney public
getting the full advantage of the “ large surpluses of fat
stock ” that the directors talk about.

Gross proceeds from sale of beer, etc., have moved like
this : 1907, £7533 ; 1908, £7525 ; 1909, £4851. That ex-
plains the trouble. The directors say that the beer
“ went off,” and the co. lost the summer trade ; but
things were bad enough even before that. Nothing has
this year been written off to cover depreciation or provide
for bad debts ; so the period has really been more dis-
astrous than the table indicates. In five years the finan-

Diamond mining in N.S.W. is in a bad way.
There may be a few stones found that are not reported,
but in general the Mines Department doesn’t think
miners and fossickers understate their haul ; yet last
year the total got down to £1358, as against a reported
£11,620 in 1904. The Inverell Diamond Fields Co. was
the biggest concern that ever tried the business in the
State ; but, after doing some most erratic things, it sold
off everything, down to worn-out picks and Windlass
barrels, at the end of 1907. While this co. was at work
(there was a time when it employed close on to
500 i men) the smaller claimholders had a pretty
good time. They explain it now by saving
that there was so much diamond-stealing that
it paid foreign buyers to have local representatives; and
thus there was some competition for stones. Nowadays
there is practically none. There probably never was a
gem'-digger who believed that he uas getting a fair price ;
and the few men left at Copeton, the one place where
fossicking is still being done, are no better pleased than
most. Since the I.D.F. Co. went under, the two principal
claims have been what is known as the Deep shaft and
the Malacca Co.’s. The former belonged to a party of six
men, who had the bad luck to bottom on a hard bar ;
still they have done pretty well, and propose to put
another shaft down ahead of their present workings.
Here as in several other claims water is a great trouble.
The stones run from anythingup to 3£ carats. Prices last
year were from£l to 225. 6d..for3’s ; for anything smalhr
than 4’s and specked stones (“rubbish” in the trade)
about Bs. 6d. is the very best price. This vear “ rubbish ”
has been sold to Sydney firms for 4s. The old Malacca
is being worked on tribute ; last year about 1000 carats
came out. Here and in many of the other claims there is
tin as well as occasional diamonds, and it’s mostly the
tin that keeps a bit in the tucker-bag. Now and again a
few boorts, or black diamonds (fused), are found; the
market seems to be most erratic, and a man who gets £4
ss. a carat to-day is liable to be knocked out by an offer
of £2 15s. or so to-morrow. In fact, fossickers complain
that they sometimes can’t get an offer for any stones,
but have to name a price, which is pretty often only
a guess. In such cases it would help them a lot if they
could get an expert opinion from the Department as to
the real value of stones submitted ; they would be better
sat sfied, of course, if the Department would market the
gems for them. Altogether, it isn’t a cheerful business,
that of gem-digger, at present; and it isn’t wonderful
that men who want a trifle of help, perhaps to unwater a
claim, stand Buckley’s chance of getting it.
Westralia’s total production of gold to the end
of July, and other minerals (including coal) to the end of
May, was valued at £91,871,805.

ITS A-COMING ON !
DON’T REMAIN BALD!
If you are ABSOLUTELY bald, you will remain so all your life—nothing on earth will
give you bank vour hair. BUT if you still have a “ down ”or light “ fluff ”on your pate,
YOUR BALDNESS CAN BE CURED.
That “ down ” or “fluff ” is YOUNG HAIR doing its utmost to grow strong and vigorous on a
parched, dry and barren scalp.
Irrigate “ That Bald Spot ” with plentiful showers of
PAPILLA HAIR TONIC,
and as sure as grass grows after a shower of rain, so surely will that “ down ” take on a new, strong
and vigorous life, and grow into long, strong and thick hair.
I positively guarantee Capilla to do all I claim for it—if it doesn’t, back goes your money. If
you want a fairer or stronger hair-growing proposition than I offer, then you don’t deserve to have
a decent growth of hair.
“I have used your Hair Tonic, which speaks for itself, it having made my hair grow on
bald patches when there seemed to be no roots at all. I was severely burned with acids on
the head, which necessitated my removal to a hospital for treatment, and am very pleased at
the way your tonic has acted. Wishing you every success.” —:S. RUSSELL, “ Leynwood,”
Prospect Terrace, Brisbane, Ist July', 1909.
“ About five years ago I began to use your Capilla, and I found it strengthened my hair
considerably. I honestly believe that if I had commenced using Capilla about nine or ten
years ago, I would have had as good a head of hair as I had in my youth. And I believe if
Capilla had been in vogue half a century ago there is many a man this day, if he were alive,
would be thankful ..—JOHNG. LUCAS, Boorooma, viaßrewarrina, N.S.W., 7th July, 1909.

In the battle Of life. Life’s battle is a bard one, and you must have steady nerve, a clear brain, and muscles like
bands of steel. The weak man or woman must give way to the strong, the robust and the vigorous. Your health and
physical vitality should be guarded as the miser guards his gold. Dr. McLaughlin, the electrical authority, has discov-
ered the true method of applying Electricity for the perfect cure of the ills and ailments
of mankind. Electricity is Nature’s Remedy. There is not a weak person in
this whole world to-day who cannot become strong, healthy and vigorous again if they
will only apply the right current of Electricity. We have a method of applying Electricity
for the cure of the various weaknesses of men and women which will cure in every case.
Our method of applying Electricity is fast supplanting the use of drugs all over the world.
DRUGS ARE USELESS!
Drugs cannot and will not cure the Nervous Ailments and Weaknesses of Men and
Women, such as Loss of Vigor and Vitality, Rheumatism, Kid-
ney, Liver and Bladder Troubles, Constipation, Stomach
Disorders, etc., etc. Nature never intended a man’s stomach to be the
receptacle for strong drugs, and if you persist in their use it will not be long until
you will be beyond curing ; your stomach will be totally destroyed. Electricity,
when applied by Dr. McLaughlin’s Electric Belt, gives to every part
of the body—as it travels over the nerves —strength and vitality, and quickly
drives out disease, no matter where it is located. When you are weak there is
simply a lack of Electricity in the system —not enough electricity to keep up your
nerve force —and before you can again be restored to vitality and vigor electricity
must be supplied. Weakness defeats the aim or ambition of man. The weak
man must be made strong before he has the necessary energy and brain power to
succeed. Electricity builds up the shattered nervous system, restores strength and
vitality, makes rich, red blood ; it is the bulwark against which disease must fall. It brings
the sunbeams of happiness and health into a life which has been darkened by weakness. We have thousands of
testimonials to prove all our assertions. Our belt is simple, easy to use and is guaranteed to give a strong current.
It has special attachments fop men and women. They are within the reach of all; price £1 and up.
Beware of cheap imitations.

Hope for the Ruptured!
No matter how long you have suffered ; no matter how many doctors
have given your case up ; THERE IS HOPE.
But hope does not lie in the use of an uncomfortable, irritating,
dangerous truss—the bane of many a man and woman. The one sure way
to cure rupture is by the Dr. J. A. Sherman method which has proved its
worth in hundreds of cases, and has been highly.spoken of by leaders in the
medical world.
Will you investigate it and find out how—without any operation ox-
interference with your work—you may become cured of this dreadful
complaint ?

efficacy of the Sherman treatment. Here’s a letter that contains but a few
words—yet how pregnant with meaning they are !

Just a line to tell you that I am quite cured of rupture by your easy and effective treatment.

Method. Write to-day—the books are free !

Ibis remarkable Watch is a standing marvel to all who
can appreciate the amount of detail involved in the pro-
duction of such a complicated piece of Watchwork.
As a timekeeper the ‘ AtJas ’ will be found to be exact
and reliable, and to all business men the advantage of
an automatic calendar will appear with great force.
It is the watch to suit Travellers, Station Managers,
Boundary Riders, Farm Hands, or anyone in an isolated
district, whose daily routine has but little variety, and
ircquently at a loss for the day of week and date.
J Bis is just where the utility of the CALENDAR WATCH is
most. videnr. As an ordinary timekeeper itis a watch
ol good quality , and the calendar mechanism having
bten i„ proved, simplified and fixed just beneath the
dial, it is not likely to get out of order with ordinary use.
'J he watch is self-acting, with the exception of the name
of the month, at the top of the dial, which requires al-
teration only once montblv. The rest is automatic, being
w oi ked by the usual mechanism of the watch. The phases
of ihe Moon are shown in the lower circle. This is very
handy, as a glance at the dial informs you, not only of
the exact phase, but enables you to quickly calculate
when the new or full moon is due. The changes are
made every 24 hours at Midnight. The Watch in illus-
tration is telling a.t ouce that it is Saturday, January 26th.

Two candidates are battling hard for the
late Speaker Holder’s seat in the House of Reps.
—J. H. Vaughan, the clever brother of the secre-
tary of the S. A. State Parliamentary Labor
party, and R.. W. Foster. Vaughan pursues
Costs; Foster has been numerous things—parson,
Minister for Works, storekeeper (his signboard is
still up at Quorn), and frequently defeated can-
didate. Of course, Foster has the National Ass.
support; and because the Labor party has thrown
its whole body and soul into the tight, the
new State Fusion is shoving Foster along, with
the memory of his two defeats dragging heavily
behind him.
Advt. from the Sydney papers of August
16, 1860—49 long years ago :
To the Right Worshipful the Mayor of Sydney.—We,
the undersigned, respectfully request you to convene a
public meeting of the citizens of Sydney, to take into
consideration the present unprotected state of the colony
in the event of a European war, and the expediency of
organising an effective armed force for its defence.
And practically the only difference (apart from a
certain awakening of the public mind on the
defence subject) is that Taylor is the mayor now,
whereas 49 years ago the mayor was Murphy.

and out of sorts, it is generally because a mild laxative
is required —not a purgative, mind ! Nothing is so truly
beneficial in such cases as a dose of California Syrup of
Figs, which the little ones accept eagerly for its delicious
flavour: and it causes no discomfort: just relieves and
corrects gently, naturally, comfortingly, overcoming the
tendency to constipation. For its perfect purity and
harmlessness, as well as for its truly beneficial effects,
it is cordially endorsed by the medical profession.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I trust our deliberations will be characterised neither
by niggling- nor peddling, but by strong views and broad
views. (Applause.)—Alfred Deakin.
OH; my brothers, do not wrangle.
When the sweets of office dangle
At a most inviting angle
Be polite.
In the legislative struggle,
When in office safe you snuggle,
Then to jangle or to juggle
Isn’t right.
And, O never, never niggle ;
Though the vulgar people giggle
When they see a statesman wriggle
To a place.
And, I prithee, never meddle
With the man who stoops to peddle,
For the act upon his head’ll
Bring disgrace.
And we ought to take a broad, strong view.
What's it matter if the prospect isn’t new ?
There is virtue in the viewing.
When it comes to merely doing,
Well, it's really not important what you do.
It’s the view —
Grand view!
Never let the doing part embarrass you.
' When in politics you dabble
Then of course you’ll have to babble,
To the vote-possessing rabble—
’Tis the game.
When you engineer a shuffle
The ensuing party scuffle
Somebody is sure to ruffle,
All the same.
Then be wary ; do not tremble ;
Smile politely and dissemble,
Though your actions do resemble
Somersaults.
When your legislative symbol
Is the tricky pea and thimble
Your manipulations nimble
Are not faults.
But, I charge you, take a strong, broad view.
It is most entrancing when you have the screw.
There’s no need to be exacting
In the manner of your acting ;
'Tis the statesman’s motto when dissensions brew
Watch the view —
Wide view 1
And your story of the sight will see you through.
When a banquet you’ve to tackle,
Where the ancient chestnuts crackle,
And you have to rise and cackle
To your kind.
Mayhap some hiccoughing freak’ll
Rise and, venturing to speak, ’ll
Mention you as “ Misher Deakle,”
Never mind.
Let your honeyed phrases trickle,
And defend the Fusion pickle ;
Show them that you are not fickle
In the least.
Say that, why we do not muzzie
Labor members is a puzzle ;
And they’ll cheer you as they guzzle
At the feast.
And bid them, take a broad, strong view.
Bid them see around both corners, same as you.
You’re the saviour of the nation
At a mayoral celebration
If you do not harp too much upon the “ do.”
Praise the view —
Grand view !
A nd they’ll vow you are a statesman strong and true.
With this popular preamble
You may then adroitly amble
To the shocking party scramble.
Voice your fears.
Tell them Labor’s sure to stumble
If it does not cease to grumble ;
And each alderman will mumble
Glad “Hear, hears.”
While the nuts they calmly nibble
Let vague phrases gently dribble ;
Give them any quip or quibble.
You’re immense !
But, ah prithee ! do not trifle
With a hint of acts ; and stifle
Any mention of a rifle
Or defence.
For there’s safety in the strong, broad view.
The suppression of the hard, strong “do ”
Is a matter most essential
When the Tory consequential
Is the man you reckon on to see you thro'.
Boost the view —
Great view ?
And they’ll all begin to think they see it too.
Budding statesmen, there is muckle
In the View when you’ve to truckle
To the crowd that will not buckle
Into graft.
When your policy's a muddle,
And you’re sailing in a puddle
With a Fusion crowd that huddle
On a raft;
Talk in vague, unmeaning jingle ;
For the crowd with which you mingle
Holds within it scarce a single
One who’ll work.
Here, where Hansard’s pages rustle,
There’s a show of rush and bustle,
But there’s ne’er a chance to hustle;
You must shirk.
Keep your eye upon the broad, strong view.
Hall the crowd s attention to it till you’re blue.
Keep them watching it intently,
And you can con-ven-i-ently
Hide the fact that you have nothing much to do.
Praise the view —
Fine view t
Fend they may forget to keep an eye on you.

The Missionary.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
AS he turned into the snuggery and
pressed the button, it did not seem on
the whole that the world was going very
well with him. His chin showed a three days’
growth of beard above a dubious collar that had
apparently been worn all night, recklessly.
Behind his blurred pince-nez his eyes were tired
and dull, piteous with the worst of all horrors—
the horror of the wise fool compelled to contem-
plate his folly. He was in dire haste to interpose
a barrier between his eyes and that spectacle, but
his unsteady hand seemed half-reluctant as he
pressed the button. With the sensuality in the
lines of his mouth, there was a strange admixture
of something unclassed, something delicate and
appealing. Had his balance been a shade more
finely adjusted, he was the man who might
have done something. As it was, he sat in an
unseemly huddle on the couch. The little room,
dingy in that light, was offensive with the reek of
dead cigars. Outside, the morning was Olympian.
Over the housetops a lark carolled joyously as it
circled in the blue.
The Girl came in, looked full at him a moment,
and turned away her eyes. His own were steadily
averted as he spoke.
“ I’ll have a whisky-and-soda, if you don’t
mind.”
“ I think you will change your order,” she said.
The man looked up at her. His features were
screwed-up, his mouth twisted. It was an ugly
way he had in moments of stress.
“ For God’s sake, don’t preach ! ”
“I am not preaching. May one not speak to
you these mornings?”
He grunted. It was not an amiable grunt. She
took no notice.
“ The other day,” she said, gently, “ and many
days before that, off and on, you told me that you
loved me. Do you understand ? You !... Me !. ..
I had no right to listen; and you—oh, you
especially ! —had no right to speak. But I let
you speak.”
“You said nothing, anyway,” said the man,
morosely.
“No. I said nothing. One may, you know,
commit the sin of listening and avoid the sin of
speech. But it may be that I thought a little. I
have heard that you make love vyell. You know
that I would not permit you merely to make love
to me. My one excuse for everything is that I
took you very seriously. You remember, I’m
sure. Are you proud of yourself this morning ? ”
“ Don’t be sarcastic. I hate myself.”
“Self-hatred is a worse offence than self-con-
ceit,” she said, “because it is considerably less
honest. You are not pleasant to look at this
morning. Your clothes are anyhow, you are
pallid and unkempt, and as to your finger-nails—
ugh ! But you love me, you know. You said so.
You have said it so often that you quite believe it
yourself. Well, what am I? ”
“You,” he began, coming eagerly out of the
slough, “ you are everything that is”
“Spare me your rhapsodies,” said the Girl.
“One may be content with prose so early in the
morning. I will tell you. lam at least healthy.
My eyes are clear, and my hands decent. I don’t
look as if I’d fallen in a riot and slept in a sty.
You pay me the poor compliment of leading me
to suppose that you are compelled to love me bv
force of contrast.”
“ You are hard,” he said.
“Not a bit. lam too easy by half with you,
and you know it. In my position, lam pecu-
liarly exposed to misapprehension and viler
things, and you (who love me, you know) are
sometimes my worst enemy. You talk to me of
Browning and Pater and Meredith—of Aucassin
and Nicolete and those others—and now you
come to me with those fingers! It is pleasant for
me—no? You make a direct appeal to the
woman that is in me, and when I am half-drawn,
you step aside to show me the hog that lurks
behind yourself. You have called me, you know
(at times when I had no right to listen), your
inspiration, your solace, your white star, and all
the rest of it. And when I have ventured, once
or twice, almost to let you think I cared, you have
gone back to the trough with undiminished
appetite. Shall I fetch you the whisky-and-
soda ? ”
“There is reason in all things,” he said.
“Surely you know that I must have one this
morning ! ”
She smiled.
“ I have some knowledge of this sort of
medicine. One would do you no earthly good,
you know. The second and third might possibly
make you feel a little better. After the third,
you would not—what was it you said just now ?
hate yourself so much, and after the fourth or
fifth I don’t suppose that you’d hate yourself at
all. Still, you should know ; you have had so
many fourths and fifths. You are quite valorous
after the fifth. After the sixth you have even
confided to bar-loungers the feeling with which
you honor me. You have been, I think, quite
interesting, after the sixth. I believe they make
admirable morning-drinks at the chemist’s ; and a
bath—don’t you think a bath would comfort you ? ”
“It might,” he admitted.
“I’d try it, if I were you. A good hot bath
and a good biting shower to follow. You don’t
really need that whisky-and-soda this morning, do
you, dear . . . friend?”
He looked full at her. His eye was clearer, and
his mouth more steady. Some of the greyness-
had gone out of his face. It seemed that possible,
somewhere, there might be something worth
having, something splendid, or at least a shrine.
“ I don’t think I shall need it all day,” he said.
He would have taken her hand ; but she put
both hands behind her. He had something im-
palpable that clawed at his throat, even while it
beat in music through his pulse. He knew that
if ever the day came when he might take her
hands in his, that day she would have nothing to i
withhold. A thought like that, with regard to a
girl like that, gives a, man pause, and nowand
then in such a pause he is succored by his gods.
“ You are my white star still,” he said.
“ Come in to-morrow morning then, and you
may see your star more clearly. You have no
right to speak of one thing, qor I to hear; but
perhaps I might listen again. We women are
weak fools, you know.”
He left her. Outside in the street, the sunlight
was wonderfully suave and sweet. He put up his
coat collar, and turned into the chemist’s.
And as she watched her salvage turn the corner,
it seemed to the girl that the lark was shedding
golden music across the loneliness of her heart
that might have been so secure a haven for that
life adrift.

Mr. G. HAIGII,
of the Harbors and Rivers Dept.
Cleanses
and Heals an
Engineer’s Ulcerated
and Inflamed Wounds.
“1ITHILE working at my trade
of engine-driving,” says Mr.
Haigh, of the Harbors and
Kivers Dept., Newcastle, NjS.'W., “a
steam-pipe burst and scalded my neck
severely. As the result of this, my neck
all broke out in ulcerated and inflamed
wounds, and caused me an immense
amount of agony. I consulted' a doctor—
also pretty well all the chemists in Newcastle—who prescribed different
lotions, which I applied, but without gaining any material benefit. Some of the
treatments would heal my neck temporarily, but it would soon break out again.
For two years I thus suffered agony, during which period my neck was like raw
meat. I could not bear to wear a collar, but always a soft muffler round my neck,
and had great difficulty in turning my head. One day I met a friend, and, when
explaining my trouble to him, he presented me with a sample pot of Zam-Buk,
which he happened to have with him, and advised me to give it a fair trial, which
I promised to do. After the fourth dressing with Zam-Buk I found the inflam-
mation greatly reduced, and I could turn my head slightly without turning the
whole of my body, as formerly. Thus encouraged, I purchased a pot at the
chemist’s and continued with the treatment, and by the time I had completed
this pot my neck was quite healed and as sound as before the accident occurred.
I can now wear a stiff collar without discomfort, and, in fact, am my old self again.”
EVERY HOME NEEDS ZAM-BUK.
/Is a healing balm for cuts, burns, scalds, bruises, abrasions,
Zam-Buk is constantly reliable; while for skin troubles which
are a daily peril, such as boils, pimples, eczema, bad legs,
ulcers, ringworm, scalp diseases, etc., it is unequalled. Zam-Buk
is obtainable from all chemists and stores at 1/6 & 3/6 per pot.
Beauty’s Favourite
The article which excels all others
in improving the beauty of the skin
is naturally and deservedly beauty’s
favourite. This has been the
acknowledged and honoured
position held by Pears' Soap for
nearly 120 years. It won, and has
maintained that position by virtue
of its complete purity, and by the
possession of those special emollient
properties which soften, refine,
and impart natural colour to the
skin. No other soap possesses
these qualities in such a pre-
eminent decree as

Matchless for the Complexion.
A Leap-Year Tragedy.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
spoon when a widow is willing is nice,
If nothing but spooning’s intended ;
But the new summer-boarder alarms me—
a'vice
Is often a virtue suspended.
Her complexion is essence of Midnight and Noon,
And her eyes are as soft as the light o’ the moon ;
In a word, she is sweeter than mulberry jam—
But her stockings are cotton —and mended ;
I’m certain her stockings are mended.
We walked by the elms till the dinner-bell rang,
And once I began to say “ Lily ...”
When a little bird hopped on my elbow and sang,
“ Beware, it is leap year, you silly ! ”
She vowed it is monstrous for men to oppose
The impulse of women —the right to propose !
But I thought I detected the fly in the jam.
And the air in the garden was chilly ;
I said, “ I am sure you are chilly ! ”
Said she, “Not at all, it is lovely, asthore,
But I fear we are keeping the dinner;
Come out after tea !” ... but I fled at the door
And cursed her, as I am a sinner !
Her conduct at breakfast was simply insane.
I frowned and she simpered—her meaning was
plain—
But although I’m convinced that the goddess is
sham,
I daily grow visibly thinner—
I’m certainly visibly thinner !
The sting of the thing is I’m madly in love
With the landlady’s dear little daughter.
She looks at me shyly, demure as a dove.
And pledges my health in cold water ;
She said “ I am sure she is perfectly sweet,
Perhaps a bit vain, but so quaintly discreet!”
But she fled like a doe when I muttered “ Oh,
Damn.”
So I kissed her five times when I caught her ;
On the stairs I was waiting, and caught her.
Now what in the world may a modest man do?
My troubles are full and they’re plenty !
If I stay she will harry me, marry me, too,
If I go who will kiss Sweet-and-Twenty ?
’Tis pleasant to flirt with a damsel in spring.
But a lone little widow’s a dangerous thing !
And in spite of the kiss in the garden I am
Determined to wed Sweet-and-Twenty—
I will marry you now, Sweet-and-Twenty !

An Easy Job.
[FOR THE BULLET IN.]
THE Hopes and Fears of life’s everyday-
tragedies came to the corner of Hunter-
street, and anxiously pored down the
columns of “Wanteds,” and then passed on.
The more tragic of the Hopes and Eears came
early and stayed longer, and those who did not
feel the true tragedy of their lot came late and
with carelessness, for with such misfortunes have
not so much significance.
Even these had dwindled down when a more
disconsolate wreck than all appeared, his shoul-
ders hunched, his hands thrust deep into his
trouser-pocket holes, and shuffling in gait.
“’Scuse me, mate,” he said to a man who was
scanning the columns, “ would yer mind readin’
me some uv these ’re wanteds. I muster left me
spectacles on ther chest uv drores.”
“Certainly,” said the man. “Whatsort of a
job do you want ? ”
“ Anythin’.”
“ What have you been doing last?”
“I’ve been livin’ on me means ever since
muvver died.”
“What did you do, then?”
“ I uster take ’ome ther washin’.”
The man paid particular attention to the
Herald for some minutes, and then he said : “ I
see they want some men to carry the hod up in
Phillip-street.”
“Too’eavy, mate, too ’eavy. It’s me chest, ”
he said, tapping himself on the breast-bone.
“ Wot’s this ’ere ?”
The man read : “‘A man wanted to take down
a brick wall. No Catholics need apply !’ ”
“That would suit me orlright,” said the man
with hunched shoulders. “Leastways, only for
ther wall.”
“You’re not a Catholic then ? ”
“No. I’m a Seventh Day Adventurer.”
“ What’s that ? ”
The seeker after work thought hard for a few
moments.
“ We believes in keepin’ sober on the Sabbat’.”
Then, quickly, “ Wot’s this say ?”
“‘W’t’d G’d C’k. C’ty. F’m’le, no E’l’rs.
10s. wk.,”’ was spelled out.
“ Wot do that mean ? ”
•“ It means that somebody is trying to do the
Herald in for a bob. I don’t know what they
:!l re advertising for though.”
“Serve ’em right for tryin’ ter get at the
’’EralD. Read me this wanted, will yer?”
■“ ‘ Tutor wanted for station. Must know
'Latin, (Greek, French, German and Hebrew.
;£l5 ja yew..’ ”
“I’m glad l wuzn’t brought up ter know all
rthem there languages. Read something else.”
“ ‘ Wanted a strong man to mind an invalid.
<3Wly good Christians need apply.’”
-“That’s me. Where do it say to apply ? ”
“•‘Dingle House, Forty-fifth Avenue, Strath-
ifield.’ ”
“ S’poae f&r ’aven’t the price of a train-fare on
-yer ? ”
“No.”
‘ Well, I’ll’’ave ter walk, that’s all. Good day,
palate.”
As he swung round he came face to face with
another man with slouching gait and hands thrust
deep in his pockets.
“ Hulloa, Stinker ! ” he said, looking abashed.
“What yer doin’ ’ere?” growled the new-
comer.
“Nu thin’.”
“ Ye’re a liar. Ye’re lookin’ fer work.”
“I’m not lookin’ fer work.”
“ Stow it. I’ve been watcliin’ yer all ther time.
If ye’re not lookin’ fer work, let me arsk yer wot
yer doin’ ’ere ? ” with withering emphasis.
“ I’m lookin’ fer wages.”
“ Orlright, but let me tell yer this—if yer gets
it, ’arf ther wages is mine or I’ll tell ther brother-
hood, an’ yer done fer Bay Mansions.”
“Make it a third, Stinker.”
“Not much. ’Alf ther bloomin’wages or yer
cake’s dough as fur as ther Bay Mansions is con-
cerned. ’Alf wages, an’ when yer doesn’t turn
up, I’ll tell ther blokes ye’ve been runned in.”
A few minutes deliberation, and then: “Oh,
orlright. So long, Stinker.”
Stinker made no reply, and they shuffled off in
opposite directions.
* * * *
It was a long walk to Strathfield, and a hot
dav, but to the observant pedestrian there are
always things to be picked up on the way.
A nice-looking gentleman answered his knock.
Willie,explained his presence.
“Shut the door and send him away, dear,”
cried a high-pitched female voice from the draw-
ing-room.
“But, Emily, dear”
"I know, Reginald ; but please close the door.”
“ Beggars can’t be choosers, dearest.”
“ I’m not a beggar, boss. I’m lookin’ fer work.”
“I was not referring to you, my man. Just
step out on to the garden path for a few minutes.”
The man who wanted wages stepped back a
pace, but came forward when Reginald had
disappeared into the drawing-room.
“ YVe really cannot send him away. No one has
applied, you know, dear, and Percy cannot be left
to himself any longer.”
“ Well, darling, have your own way, but do
insist on his having a bath.”
“My good man.” explained the gentleman,
“we want a man to look after my son, who is an
invalid. We propose to give a suitable man £2 a
week to look after him.”
Willie was thinking about the stipulation made
by the lady, and said, “ Make it £3, guv’nor, and
I’ll ’ave the job.”
“Very well, we’ll give the £3 on condition that
you have a good bath first.”
“And tell the man, Reginald,” cried the high-
pitched voice inside, “that he must be kind to
poor Percy.”
“Orlright, missus,” said the man, craning his
neck forward. “I won’t’arm him. Not me. I
wouldn’t ’arm a flea.”
“No, I am sure you wouldn’t,” said the lady,
and then burst into loud weeping. “ But I want
you to be kind to Percy.”
The man almost wept too.
There were both hot and cold taps in the bath-
room, and both were turned full on. He stripped,
and stepped in much as a.man goes to his doom,
only one side of his mouth kept violently twitch-
ing.
“ I’ll take these clothes of yours away, and fetch
you another suit.”
“ Don’t do away with them duds, boss.”
“I’ll burn them.”
Once you are into a bath, it is not so bad if the
water is not cold. You are half inclined to like
it. It is the getting in that tells. You are almost
sorry then that you never made a habit of baths.
Reginald returned with a Harris tweed suit and
knitted stockings. He said : “ They are scarcely
suited for this hot climate, but they will make up
for what comes off in the bath. But you are not
rubbing yourself. Take the loofah and rub hard.
That’s it. Keep it up and you might find some
money.”
The Harris tweed tickles the skin terribly,
especially after you have had a bath—that is if
vou have rubbed yourself properly with a loofah.
But the tickling of the coarse tweed is borne when
you see yourself in the mirror. You look like
King Edward the Seventh when he wears his
knickerbockers.
“Now go and show yourself to Percy,” said
Reginald. “ You will find him sitting under the
pines.”
He found a beefy young man sitting dejectedly
at the end of the garden. His face was very red,
and his eyes inflamed.
“ Hulloa, what’s this !” exclaimed Percy.
“It’s on’y me, guv’nor.”
“ And who the devil are you-?”
“I’m ther bloke wot’s come ter mind yer.”
“ Oh, you are ! Well, sit down and let me look
at you.”
He scanned him carefully for a quarter of an
hour, and there was something so intent in his
gaze that the man felt very uncomfortable. At
last Percy said :
“ I know you.”
The man said nothing.
■“I know you,” he repeated angrily.
The man felt that some attempt should be made
to pacify the growing anger, and he told Percy
that he had never “se’ed him afore.”
“You’re William the Conqueror.”
“No, I’m not, boss. I’m William Burr.”
“Liar! You are William the Conqueror, and
I’ve been waiting for you since five o’clock. I
have sworn to kill you. lam sorry to do it, but I
must keep my oath. I know you can’t help being
William, but that is not my fault. Let me get
the axe.”
The young man believed, like the murderer in
“Macbeth,” that anything that had to be done had
better be done quickly, and he fairly flew towards
the wood-heap. William Burr was just as quick
in reaching the fence. Percy was too far off to
deal a doughty blow, so he threw the axe.
William Burr knew what he was doing without
looking.
The man who lived next door was a dog-fancier.
The dogs were mostly man-fanciers. William
Burr reached the top of the second fence with
something hanging on to the seat of his breeches.
He wriggled over all right; but the something
wouldn’t let! go, and Willy didn’t know what to
do. It was good tweed, but it was the first to let
go. William Burr felt safe when he was over the
third fence.
At Bay Mansions that night Willy had a tale
to tell. Stinker was all interest. When William
had completed the story he said, reflectively:
“En they called him a invalid.”
An hour later Stinker called from his couch :
“ Get ter sleep, Willy, en don’t be shakin’ as if
yer ’ad the ager.”
“ I’m cold,” said Willy. -7 ]
“ Y’ear that, blokes. Willy says jie’s cold.”
“Don’t forgit that I’ve ’ad a barf,” said Willy.

The Leader of Them All?
That is, Ayer’s Sarsaparilla; not
some other kind, but “Ayer’s.”
This grand old family medicine
has stood the test for over sixty
years. That’s the kind you
should take. You cannot afford
to experiment, your health is
too precious.
You may not now be really ill
from some well-defined disease, and yet
you know you are all run down, your
nerves are unstrung, and you feel weak
and discouraged.
AYER’S Sarsaparilla
is the strongest and best medicine you can
take to remove this tired and exhausted
feeling. It brings cheer, hope, courage.
As now made, Ayer’s Sarsaparilla contains no alcohol.
There are many imitation Sarsaparillas that will disap-
point you. Be sure that you get “AYER’S.”
by Dr. J. C. Ayer & Co., Lowell, Mass., U. S. A.
