A FLYING-
FIGHTER AT
WAR
The Week’s Best:—
Anyone who
spent a little or
a lot of time at
the war might
have guessed that
a co u nterblast
would come to the kind of war outlook
represented in such works as All Quiet,
Good-bye to All That, Death of a Hero,
not to mention the several hundreds of
trashy whinings got up to meet the paci-
fist market of half a dozen years ago.
In fact, half a dozen years ago some-
body suggested as much on the Red
Page, pointing out that there was an-
other outlook on the job in hand mani-
fested by the majority of fighting men
from that forming the general theme of
all that pitiful sentimentalising of
cowardice. That writer was promptly
jumped on, of course, by* a host of
moralisers, who said he was either a mili-
tarist or a coward. If they have any
consistency they should now greet with
holy rage the appearance of the growing
trickle of books the writers of which
are plainly bent on demonstrating that
the war was won by our side partly at
least because a majority of the fighters
on this side happened to be built on the
moral lines of Mick Mannock.
At any time during the war nobody
in his senses would have disputed that:
it became obscured only in the flood
of gloti fying-cowardice literature that
seemed to go down so well with a post-
war generation faced with the appalling
calamity of having to foot the bill. For
a book-writer to use it for theme even
three or four years ago was to court cer-
tain disaster: it was held to be glorify-
ing war to try to reveal the courage of
the men who won it. Yet the plain fact
is that, though few had much of the
cold, ferocious bloodlust that inspired
Mannock, thousands had his kind of
courage, and hundreds of thousands were
at least above the cowardice of the
popular-reading panderers.
The bloodlust which, according to Ira
Jones, in his biography King of Air
Fighters, fired that tigerish youth Man-
nock through years of relentless Fritz-
hunting in the air in France was
certainly a peculiar quality. It began
to look like madness towards the end—
in Mannock’s reiterated lust to see the
cross-marked ’planes going down in
flames (“Sizzle, sizzle, wonk!”). Much
more representative among those gentry
whom even the infantry would gape at
in admiration was the inspiration Jones
credits to most of Mannock’s companions
—they chased Fritz about the skies be-
cause it seemed the greatest sport ever
invented. Mannock did it —to the tune
of 70-odd officially recorded victories
because he had a terribly cold-blooded
and unswerving hatred of Fritz and all
his designs and works. He made a
specialty of the art of killing, until he
was, what those fighters so often looked
like, a fierce and ferocious hawk—as a
killer, Jones argues, without an equal
in any of the armies, and not even ap-
proached by the much-
advertised Richthofen,
who figures in this book
as a killer of “easy
meat” only and a pic-
turesque liar.
There is- just a bit
too much of this justifi-
cation of Mannock at
the expense of others:
Jones who himself
brought down 40-odd
German ’planes—pur-
sues it with an appli-
cation which suggests
that he may have done
his fighting in much
the same spirit as
Mannock. The book
would certainly have
been better without
most of this special
pleading, but, even
with it, it’s uncom-
monly fascinating read-
ing. As biography,
first merit is that it does make the
extraordinary character of Mannock real.
It makes real also the whole exciting
business of air-fighting, remarkably so,
considering the author’s limited talent in
descriptive writing; and it gives an
authentic account of life as lived among
the air-fighters.
Mannock.
ANOTHER
OF THE
COURAGEOUS
In his own
sphere as pecu-
liar, and also as
typical, as Man-
nock, Paul Maze
adds another to
these new, fresh books of the war:
A Frenchman in Khaki. Like Jones’s
book, it escapes the charge of caricature:
it gives, for those who can read it there,
both sides of the picture of the curious
scrap. Anyone who wants to go Hun-
strafing after reading Jones’s account's
of the “dogfights” in the air will, at any
rate, have a beginner’s courage, and any-
one who wants to go to a war after read-
ing Maze’s account of the Australians
at Pozieres should apply for Ms enlist-
ment pass at Callan Park. But Maze,
like Jones, has little time for the coward.
Their theme is that they, with others,
were in a job, and anyone who shirked
it deserved all that came to him.
Maze, telling his own stoiy, simply sets
down facts, and the reader has a stirring
story of a man’s courage. Like Mam
nock, who had one eye which should
never have passed and yet could spot an
enemy ’plane miles away, Maze was phy-
sically deficient. His own people did
not want him, so he simpty attached him-
self to the British and became accepted
as a sort of liaison officer without com-
mission, going out from headquarters in
the morning to the front line and even
beyond it, and coming in again at night
to report on anything that had taken his
eye. His book estab-
lishes him as one of
the most extraordinary
figures of the war.
Incidentally, it gives
accounts of Australians
in action at Pozibres
and Villers-Bretonneux
that measure up to
Masefield’s remarks in
Gallipoli. |
These are books by
men. They are written
without sourness, and
they have the advan-
tage over the kind of
a few years ago in
being not only accurate
but verifiable.

A Paragon
Among
Prawns
Only twice
have I been in
what you might
call contact with
a literary mgn,
and the experi-
ence on the first occasion was so touch-
ing, and on the second so moving, that
my wife Cecilia, who is a Great Reader,
has insisted that I should write it all
down, so that my name might become a
byword throughout Australia, and pos-
sibly the civilised world as well. Then,
if Cecilia is right, I will be qualified to
become a member of the Fellowship of
Writers, and sign my name Claude Cat-
fish, F.0.W.L.5.; the L.S, standing for
Literary Section. So I will begin at the
beginning, which seems as good a place
as any.
You must try to imagine me calling
upon a literary man. This should be easy
when I tell you that I airi in the small
goods trade myself, and we had also met
previously on a common footing in the
pub. It was, in fact, in respect to this
previous meeting that I called upon him.
To put it quite bluntly, I was somewhat
curious to know....
“Naturally, Claude dear.”
“Thanks, Cecilia darling.”....
naturally curious to know whether his un-
questionable intellect was equal to re-
calling a small matter of half a crown,
and I found that it wasn’t. In other
words, the first time I met him he Stung,
hummed, nipped, bit, put the acid On me,
cadged, lugged me, lightened my ex-
chequer to the extent of, and, in short,
virtually touched me for half a dollar,
and forgot if.
However, he insisted that I should take
away a book that was lying on his
desk..,,
“I trust you will not make that point
too obvious, Claude.”.,.,
and concerning which he made, as far as
I am able to recall his exact words, the
following moving speech:
“I’m sorry, but you see how it is, Cat-
fish, old man, I’m right up to my — —i
ears in it”
“Did he say that , Claude?”
“No, darling, he didn’t ; but it sounds
better than what he did 5ay,”,...
“Some other time, Catfish, old chap.”
he proceeded. “Meanwhile, take this
book. Ho, that’s quite all right, don't
bother to return it. I’d rather you didn’t, ,
But read it, Catfish, old fellow. Yes,
read it; it will do you good. It is the
life story of a man whose career and per-
sonal qualities are an object-lesson to
us all. I have written my criticism of it.
Ah, yes, here it is. I am calling my
criticism ‘A Paragon Among Prawns.*
‘This writer,’ I am saying, ‘has given Aus-
tralia the Big Biography of a Great Aus-
tralian that all Australians have been
waiting for. His vocabulary is, beyond
question, the most suitable for the pur-
pose that could have been found either
here or abroad,’
“A good touch that, don’t you think,
Catfish? Always knock those abroad
beggars. Encourage the local talent.”
“Speaking of touches”——
“No, don’t interrupt, Catfish, like a
good chap. Listen to this: ‘The bio-
grapher proves how adequate he is to his

great task even in his introduction, where
he so tellingly says’:
Compelled, while still only nine years of
age, to earn his living under conditions
which would have sapped the resistance
of any but the big-souled, Macpherson
Robertson struggled against adversity to
help his beloved mother; and, spurred on
by love and ambition, succeeded in
thoroughly learning the confectionery
trade.
“What d’you think of that, Catfish,
eh? But I can see you are deeply moved,
as we all must be, prawns that we are!
‘Naturally,’ I go on to say, ‘when a bio-
grapher capable of that sort of writing
comes to such an important occurrence
as the birth of his hero, he rises to the
occasion—nay, he transcends the tran-
scendental. This famous passage, as it
will surely become, is undoubtedly
unique, not only in Australian biography,
but in the biography of all time. It can
only be appreciated in the exact words
of the original, as follows’;
The morning of September 6, 1860,
ushered in one of the coldest and bleakest
days of that winter. Rain fell continu-
ously from four o’clock in the morning
until ten. Then the sun struggled through
the grey clouds, but only for a short .while.
It seemed, however, to bring a ray of
hope to the expectant mother. But the
rain came on again and continued inter-
mittently throughout the rest of the day.
At half-past three in the afternoon for a
little while again the sun bathed and soaked
the countryside in light, and it was during
this second burst of sunshine that Mac-
pherson Robertson was born.
“ That, readers,’ I go on to say, ‘is
an indication of the heights to which the
art of biography has been carried in this
country. What,’ I have added, ‘has bio-
graphy anywhere to compare with such
passages as this?’:—
It is no exaggeration to say, that the
script signature of the founder is the best-
known signature in Australia to-day. One
of the first tasks which the pupil at school
sets himself is to copy this well-known
signature, and once he can copy it he feels
that he has added something to his list
of achievements.
“But there, Catfish, old lad, I’ve read
enough to illustrate my thesis that in this
Big Book we come into close personal
contact with one who can only be de-
scribed as a Paragon among Prawns.
;Take it away, read it; best of all,, write
me your views on it. Ha, happy thought!
Get half-dozen like yourself write views
ion same. Cause a furore. You will read
in it how Macßobertson’s halfpenny
sticks caused a furore in the ’eighties.
Anyway, whatever you do, Catfish, read
it. Good-bye, old man. It will do you
good.”
Well, that, as well as I can remember,
was the speech. I expected the book
might do me good, too. It was priced at
five shillings ; but, though I tried it at
seven pubs on the way home, it did
me no good whatever. They all told me
they already had a book, and that it kept
them awake at night thinking of some of
the horrible truths it told them about the
fickleness of hotel customers regarding
their debts.
In the end I had to carry it home, and
this was really the crux of the whole
matter. It mightn’t have been, only for
the wet Sunday, and the week’s flood-
waters that had washed all the bream out
to sea, and, having celebrated Armistice
Day on the Saturday, Snodge had set his
'bed on fire that night and was busy shift-
ing to another boarding-house, so he
couldn’t come fishing, anyway. I have
always believed strongly in the power of
Destiny ever since I lost a tote ticket and
found it again and two others for the
same race besides, and none of them
got a place, so I sat down and read the
book.
Here I wish to interlope....
“I am certain ‘interlope’ is not the
right word, Claude.”
“I’m sorry, Cecilia ; that’s what I in-
tend to d 0.”....
in order to make the personal confession
that I have very often been tempted to
set down the full unvarnished biography
of my friend Snodge also. I have so
often been staggered....
“In order to be veracious, Claude dear,
is it really necessary for you to be ob-
scene?”. ...
in his company by both his individual
personal merits and his public perform-
ance that if I had a tithe of the grand-
stand manner of a Great Biographer....
“Surely you mean the ‘grand manner,’
Claude.”
“I wish to be precise, darling.”....
I would set it all down once and for all
to read. I would instance, in general
terms, the exquisite verve with which he
can nip a publican and sink what he
nips; his stoical patience in the face of
a rebuff ; his deep erudition concerning
the habits, customs, haunts and hooking
of bream ; his unrivalled acumen as a
judge of rum ; his fine sense of the quality
and ripeness of bait; his past agility and
undying glory as a dirt-track rider ; and,
finally, his continuous public donations
towards keeping the grass fresh and
green at our principal national resorts, in-
cluding Randwick, Flemington, Ascot
and Menangle Park.
Hitherto the temptation to set all this
and much more down about Snodge has
enjoyed the distinction of being the only
one I have been able to resist; and that
I now succumb to it is possibly as high
a tribute as is likely to be paid to the
book which has inspired my suc-
cumb ....
“I am sure nobody on earth will
understand that, Claude.”
“Darling, there are always the gods.”
“Certainly, Claude dear, if you are
satisfied with a cheap public.”....
which book is none other than this very
book I have been writing about, and
which I have here beside me....
“Do you know where it is, Cecilia?”
“Under the iron keeping the corn-
beef lid down, darling.”
“H’m ; it’s got a bit steamed, dear.”
“I hope you turned the gas down,
darling.”
“Yes, of course I turned the blasted
gas down. Damn it all, look at this
book! I can’t even read the name of it.
What is the name of it, tell me that, will
you?”
“Certainly, Claude dear. I tore the
title-page out to keep the grocery list.
Here we are, love. The book is entitled
Making It Happen: The Rise of Sir
Macpherson Robertson, Kt., F.R.G.S., by
George Taylor.”
“Thank you, Cecilia dear. What do
you think I ought to say about it?”
“I think, Claude darling, you should
say, ‘As one prawn to another, he is a
paragon indeed; and so is his biog-
rapher.’ ”

A Choice of Verse:—
THE GIRL IN THE ’BUS.
•From left and right huge matrons on huge haunches
Surge and converge with the swaying of the ’bus;
A thin man shrinks into the evening news
As if it were his shell; and two discuss
The latest devilry against the Jews.
The girl across the way is isled as I
Between a thigh and creaking obstinate thigh,
And while in secret outrage 1 ma\e remote
My body in a cube of steel disdain,
With wild desire I note
Her lithe live limbs, her honey-golden throat.
It may be she, it may be she who holds
The clue to my lost lake, the green, the blinding s\y,
The shakjng cool lost leaves. And we will age I
Now while 1 dare, though she’s remote as I
In a cold cube of silence and great rage,
I’ll lean across, and clutch her hand and say
“That green incredible lake! You kjiow the way?”
But she is walled so deep in steel disgust
From the huge pressure of her huge companions
That at my glorious lust
The most she’ll do is start, and stare nonplussed.

DOUGLAS A. STEWART.
Protecting
the
Author
Authors who
reveal bus iness
sense are negli-
gible. If they
worked out the
time of writing,
revising and typing a 70,000-word novel,
calculated the chances of acceptance by
a publisher (about 1 in 100) and bal-
anced the (perhaps) return of £2O or £3O
for an average first novel, the writing of
which had occupied from three to twelve
months, they would find the dole more
remunerative —and surer.
But it is almost impossible to shake the
belief of the young author that his novel
is not another Anthony Adverse. The
poorer the novel, the stronger the convic-
tion, as a rule. The novel author has
only one aim in life —to find a publisher
—and if there is any easier mark for a
confidence man I would not like to meet
it.
The young writer with his first novel is
as helpless as a poddy in a bog. He
gazes on what he has done and wonders
what the hell is the next step. He has no
union to advise him. Eventually he will
write to a newspaper for advice and his
MSS. will start on the rounds, while the
author becomes a connoisseur of rejec-
tion slips. Then, suddenly, his novel is
accepted, and, still breathless from the
shock, he signs on the dotted line before
the publisher can change his mind.
Most authors find their contracts per-
fectly satisfactory; some have reason to
think otherwise ; they may have identical
agreements, so it follows that everything
hinges on the integrity of the publisher.
Between a fair-minded author and a re-
putable publisher a verbal agreement
would work well; with the other sort of
publisher the present-day contract is in
many respects useless. It is a one-sided,
fair-weather agreement, yielding scant
protection to the author.
An author considers himself covered
by the clause which states that, should the
publisher definitely default in payment of
royalties to the author, “all rights con-
veyed in the agreement shall revert to
the author without further notice” ; but
when it is closely examined or tested it
gives him absolutely nothing. Supposing,
for instance, a publisher sells 1000 copies
of an edition of 2000, and consistently
evades the payment
of royalties. After
giving three months’
notice, the author
may attempt to re-
cover the amount by
taking the publisher
to court, the costs
of which may exceed
the amount of in-
debtedness. If he
wins he is still no
further ahead; the
publisher still holds
1000 copies of his
book, which he may
put away in the
storeroom until the
book is commer-
cially dead, or he
may get in early and
sell them at re-
mainder rates and
kill the market for
the publication of
the book by anyone
else.
The average liter-
ary agreement is not
a business proposi-
tion. The essence of
the contract insists
that the author shall
trust blindly and im-
plicitly in the in-
tegrity of the other; in many cases, as a
document it is legally unsound. Instead
of printing an edition of 2000 copies, a
publisher may bring out and sell 3000.
The author must accept his statement of
sales because he has no means of chal-
lenging it. It is a position which lends
itself naturally to sharp practice by un-
scrupulous publishers—they are few, but
they exist, as many others have found,
at their cost.
So long as authors are condemned to
live and work singly and alone and are
denied the opportunity of talking shop
with fellow-writers, they must continue to
be at the mercy of the dishonest pub-
lisher. Improved conditions will never
result from the “every-man-for-himself”
idea. For some time, the Fellowship of
Australian Writers has been working
toward the framing of a more equitable
literary publishing agreement. It has the
co-operation of leading publishers, and
hopes at an early date to arrive at a stan-
dard agreement for Australia which will
be acceptable to publishers while giving
the author more adequate protection than
he now obtains. The F.A.W. has been
criticised for bringing writers together ;
if it does wrong in helping authors to
avoid commercial pitfalls, in advising
newcomers in the marketing of their work
and offering them the experience that has
been paid for by others, then the Fel-
lowship is deserving of all the adverse
criticism that has been directed at it.
J.J.H.
Through Space and Time, by Sir
James Jeans (Cambridge University
Press; 8s. 3d.). A fascinating book based
on lectures, and dealing with the present,
past and future of the universe. It is
a vast journey on which Sir James Jeans
takes us, amazing and exciting.
Murder of My Patients, by Mignon
G. Eberhart (Bodley Head; 7s. 6d.).
Bayard Thatcher is murdered. Several
members of the aristocratic family to
which he belonged have reasons for wish-
ing him dead. Who, then, fired the shot?
For those who enjoy mystery novels,
good value.
Skylighters, by J. B. Morton (Heine-
mann; 7s. 6d.). J. B. Morton wrote a book
that compared with the bulk of novels as
a pint of beer does with a malted milk.
Hag’s Harvest was something out of the
ordinary. Perhaps it is the memory of
this that makes Skylighters seem so flat.
Written by anybody, Skylighters would
not raise enthusiasm ; coming from Mor-
ton, it arouses only disappointment. The
new-religion racket has been handled by
so many authors, from Sinclair Lewis
down to obscure, nameless satirists, that
the theme has got beyond the threadbare
to the boring. But Morton fails in more
than choice of a subject. Hag’s Harvest
was remarkable for its full-bodied flavor,
its mad, fantastic incident and humor,
and that rich blend of Rabelais and
Chesterton at his best which permeated
it. Skylighters has none of those quali-
ties. The only person in the book who
manages to give a fairly consistent im-
pression of being alive is Ephraim
Clutch.
A Satchel of Books
Henry G. Lamond, of Molle Islands,
Proserpine (N.Q.), one of the most fre-
quent and consistent of Bulletin con-
tributors—his paragraphs alone, placed
end to end, should reach from here to
the moon—has written a book on birds,
An Aviary of the Plains (Angus and
Robertson; 65.). In a style as breezy,
homely and vivid as Steele Rudd’s he
describes the wild hawks, ducks, falcons,
eagles, magpies, brolgas and pelicans and
dozens of other good Australians.
Lamond’s birdlore is encyclopaedic ; he’s
made friends with all sorts of shy feath-
ered creatures, and can say something
new about even Kelly the Crow. The
brightest bird-book written for a long
while. But if it runs into the further
editions it deserves it should be illus-
trated.

THIS FAVORED LAND.
Australia is not yet out of trouble, and
to many thousands of honest people
1934 was an unhappy year.. But com-
pared with countries outside the British
Empire this is a favored land.
Spain has had a revolution. France
averted one only after some bloodshed.
Austria suffered a socialist rising and a
Nazi attempt at a coup d’etat within a
few months. Its ruler was assassinated;
so was the King of Yugoslavia, and with
him Barthou, doyen of French Foreign
Ministers. Hitler had to contend with
a mysterious plot; his Government saved
itself —or so it asserts —by swift execu-
tions, the victims of which included his
own chief-of-staff, Rohm, and General
Schleicher, named as a possible suc-
cessor to the then President. Russia,
home of the brotherhood of man, has
witnessed the butchery of scores of
former members of the ruling gang in
revenge for the shooting of Kirov, who
lived with Stalin and might have suc-
ceeded him.
Paraguay and Bolivia have had a war.
Yugoslavia and Hungary have been
within measurable distance of one ; so,
apparently, are Italy and Abyssinia. The
Chinese republic remains a prey to strife;
during 10 months of 1934 a population
equal to that of Brisbane was wiped
out. The assassin is still active in India.
Sir John Anderson, Governor of Bengal,
recently was shot at, and a letter received
in Australia from Chittagong says this:
We still live on the powder dump here.
It is virtually compulsory for every Euro-
pean to go armed. The girls appear at the
afternoon-tea table with their revolvers, and
it is no joke or official stupidity either.
Everybody is in real danger.
There was a general strike in Cali-
fornia. In other parts of the country
which is having a New Deal regardless
of cost machine-guns have been fired
and tear-gas has been unloosed in the
streets. Britain and the Dominions have
witnessed no such scenes. They have no
dictators and desire none.
Fascists have appeared in Britain, but
they haven’t been able to stage a demon-
stration sufficient to get the leaders
indicted, though a few were committed
for trial. Reds are to be found in Aus-
tralia, but beyond promoting a few argu-
ments about Messrs. Kisch and Griffin
they have accomplished nothing. There
was a Commonwealth election campaign
in 1934; beside even subsidiary disturb-
ances in Europe it sounded like the Great
Antarctic Silence. Depression has not
brought forth a crime wave, and during
the twelvemonth no Australian was
hanged.
One check to recovery there has been.
Wool prices have slumped: the return for
the first half of the present season was only
£12,000,000, against £23,000,000 during
the corresponding period of last year.
With the decline the trade balance has
gone against us —for the July-October
quarter it was £1,022,000 on the wrong
side —but this is an index to other coun-
tries’ tribulations rather than our own.
In Queensland, according to the bulletin
of the Bureau of Industry,
The increased volume of sugar, beef and
butter exports overseas has compensated for
the loss in wool. Bank deposits and railway
revenue are remarkably high, and well
above pre-dtpression levels.
For four months to the end of Octo-
ber in Queensland a fall in the export
value of wool and skins—£767,ooo—was
more than balanced by the increase in
the export value of other primary pro-
ducts—£77o,ooo.
It is true that this was not uniform
throughout the other States. And there
are still over 300,000 Australians without
regular jobs. But no one goes hungry,
and no one need lack shelter; and if relief
schemes are still necessary we can at
least get the money for them, though a
bold reduction of taxes conditional to
the greatest possible extent on the provi-
sion of jobs might give better re-
sults. Trade-union reports show that
nearly 100,000 employees went back into
work last year. Savings-bank de-
posits were £212,556,000 at the end of
last quarter, against £192,400,000 at the
lowest depression ebb in 1932 —the im-
provement represents £3 per head of
population.
Nineteen-thirty-four goes out with the
heaviest Christmas spending which the
Commonwealth has seen for years.
Nineteen-thirty-five comes in with the
promise of a great expansion in the gold
output, which has steadily increased since
1930. Difficulties remain, but to people
in other lands, especially warlike people,
this country must look like an earthly
paradise, strangely ill-guarded at the
gates.
THE WAR-HATERS.
Rear-Admiral Ford recently told us that
Australia is in danger owing to its lack
of effective defence. Other people whose
job it is to understand such matters
have told us the same. The cables tell
us almost every day how the world over-
seas is turning itself into vast armed
camps. The Saar plebiscite may create
a dangerous situation. Japan has inti-
mated that it will fight if its intentions on
China are interfered with.
Certainly, we have a Defence Depart-
ment —one whose clerical secretary
draws a salary larger than that of the
major-general who attends to the mili-
tary part of it. Under the secretary is
a strong body of clerks, entrenched in
positions which give a leading aircrafts-
man or a seaman gunner cause for envy.
We have in Mr. Lyons a Prime Minister
who hates war. He hates it so deeply
that he cannot bring himself to take much
interest in it or in the horrible business
of preparations for it. He is not alone
in this; all our politicians hate war;
only the returned-soldier members urge
that we Cannot escape it by being un-
prepared for it.
In the costly halls of Canberra politi-
cians who claim to be pacifists hurl de-
fiance in each other’s teeth. They even
walk out of the Chamber as a noble
gesture. Over the defence vote? Not a
bit of it. Over flour-taxes or bananas.
As professional students of crowd
psychology, they know that any actively
expressed interest in the improvement
of Australia’s defences would do them
no good at the next election. Defence
costs a lot of money already; effective
defence would cost a lot more, and the
money could not be made to yield any
adequate number of votes. Certain of
them also hold the comfortable view that
a universal strike —the refusal of “the
proletariat” to “become cannon fodder
for the capitalists”—will prevent any risk
of another war.
Instructed by such tribunes, young city-
bred Australia hates war. Daddy’s War
is old stuff, and the pictures have made
•it clear that the Americans won it for
him, mainly in the air—though the
Liberty ’planes that were to darken the
skies and rain bombs on Germany for
40 days and 40 nights never arrived.
Older Australians hate war for what it
did to them and theirs. That is, when
they think of it. They think of it less and
less as time goes on. For those who
served, the horror and the filth are dimmed
by years of normal life, and by that
subtle psychological twist which dulls the
recollections of unpleasant happenings
and exalts those of pleasant ones. But,
they’d hate the boys to experience what
they went through. Those who did not
serve have read and heard enough of
war’s reality, and have seen enough of
its results between 1914 and to-day, to
hate the idea of another war.
Daddy’s War is old stuff. It was a war
between soldier and soldier. The next
war’s objective will be the civilian popu-
lation. The next war’s weapons will be
aeroplanes and gas. All nationals will be
belligerents, especially the people who live
in the cities and make the munitions. A
bombing aeroplane is really a huge pro-
jectile, self-steering and self-propelling,
with a range of over 1000 miles. It can
carry two or more tons of gas-bombs.
Mustard gas is easy to make from ma-
terials which every big chemical industry
uses daily. It hangs about clothing for
days, it destroys the skin slowly and pain-
fully, it destroys the lung tissues when
inhaled even in small proportion. Lewisite
is more painful, more insidious and more
deadly. A few grains of “Blue Cross”
to each cubic yard of air causes unutter-
able agony and destroys the victim’s
mental faculties. A recent tellurium-de-
rivative gas penetrates the skin insidi-
ously, and, once through, is 100 times
more deadly than strychnine.
Gas-masks, as a means of protection
of civilian populations, are useless. They
deteriorate rapidly, they need careful,
accurate adjustment, and they do not pro-
tect against the skin-poisoning gases.
Imagine a mother trying to fit gas-masks
on half a dozen frightened young chil-
dren in the middle of the night, sur-
rounded by a chaos of explosions and
incendiary bombs! So-called “gas-proof
shelters,” underground railways, cellars,
tunnels and the rest would be mere death-
traps in a gas attack.
We need be under no delusion that
our distance from Europe and Asia will
be any protection. We cannot look to
Britain to hold the seas between or to
protect us while we enlist, train and
equip a sufficient army and air force.
We are practically unarmed. The new
warfare is to the old as a bullet in the
heart compared with ten rounds of
heroic fisticuffs.
And what can we do about it? We
might increase our air force to five or
six times its present size, and make it
the most efficient of its size in the world.
We might build our own ’planes, make
our own air munitions. We have already
produced the most skilful and daring of
the world’s air pilots; we have more of
them amongst us, only wanting the
opportunity to learn the craft. We might
establish flotillas of pocket submarines
of the Shark type, which, “costing
£250,000, is unsurpassed for rapid div-
ing and is capable of discharging a salvo
that would disable any battleship afloat.”
We could, at relatively small cost, make
it a serious undertaking for any foe who
might endeavor to establish a base on
our shores. Or we can just go on hating
war, and doing nothing to prepare for it.
THE MEAT WRANGLE.
The Commonwealth Government is in a
cleft stick over the proposed British meat
restrictions. The Old Man in London
wants to apply a quota system to imports
of Dominion meat until March 31, when
his system of subsidies to British meat-
producers will expire: the object appar-
ently is to prevent a flood of Dominion
imports offsetting the effects of the
subsidy.
It has been reported that the British
will agree to one of two methods
of restriction: either to the suspen-
sion of beef and veal imports for
two months, leaving the mutton and lamb
position unaffected, or else to a general
quota based on the average exports from
Australia of beef, mutton and lamb in
the first quarters of the past three years.
From March 31 it is proposed to de-
termine a long-range control policy
based on the Ottawa agreements but un-
complicated by the British subsidy.
The Commonwealth Government al-
ready has agreed to hold up beef and
veal exports for six weeks ; but, against
the advice of its High Commissioner
and the urgent representations of all
the other affected Dominions —Canada,
Maoriland, South Africa and S. Rho-
desia have cabled supporting the British
Government —it refuses to do more. This
attitude, it has been warned by Mr.
Bruce, “might gravely prejudice the in-
terests of Australian producers when the
long-range policy for the control of the
British meat market is considered.” Mr.
Thorby says “it is essential that there
should be no restriction, especially be-
cause Australia has honored its obliga-
tions by increasing its imports of British
manufactures by £8,300,000 during the
past two years, while its exports to
Britain have increased only by
£3,100,000.”
In terms of money, the immediate re-
striction does not matter much. It will
happen whether we like it or not. Meat
exporters are not in the least perturbed ;
but local politics must be served, and
there is even talk of a split in the
Cabinet.
The Ottawa arrangements have been
very useful to the Australian meat trade.
By the second quarter of 1934 they had
secured, on Britain’s part, a reduction of
foreign imports of mutton and lamb by
35 p.c., and of beef by 31 p.c. It must be
remembered that' at the date of the Ottawa
discussions there was no guarantee that
Australia could successfully export beef
equal to Argentine supplies. The new
conditions brought Vesteys and the Blue
Star line into the Australian trade. And
since Ottawa the average price of Aus-
tralian mutton and lamb at Smithfield
has increased substantially—first-quality
wethers, which averaged about 3d. in
1932, made a trifle less than 41d.
in the first half of 1934; first-quality
lambs showed a 25 p.c. to 30 p.c, rise.
There has been little change in beef.
In July-October (1934) Australia ex-
ported to Britain 122,910,0001 b. of
mutton, lamb and beef, as against
96,841,0001 b. for the same period of
1933. The value went up from £1,339,000
to £1,965,000. To Queensland the
four months showed an advance of
46 p.c. in beef-export value over the
1933 term. In 1929 our beef and
mutton export was only 148,351,0001 b.,
or about one-sixth more than the first
four months’ quantity in the present
year.
It is unfortunate that Ministers should
have separated over the holiday period,
though that is the invariable practice.
There can be no decision till January 3
at the earliest. Restriction of exports
appeals to no Australian, but Australia
stands to lose a great deal more by going
into the conference on long-term arrange-
ments branded as the Opposition than
by giving way on an issue which seems
vital mainly to Country-party politicians.
It is Mr. Bruce’s job to negotiate in
these matters. He knows that Australia
is wholly against restriction as a general
principle; if he thinks it right to con-
cede a small point, which must be lost
anyhow, in order to gain a big one, his
judgment might well be trusted. At any
rate, the industry has reason to wonder
at all the secrecy about his cablegrams.
It seems a fair thing to publish a precis
of them or some detailed statement by
him on the position.
WOMEN AND CHILDREN LAST.
As a result of the Argyle Government’s
Financial Emergency Act women 23
years of age employed in the Victorian
public service are paid £2 9s. a week.
If they live long enough and have suffi-
cient years of service behind them, they
may rise to the dizzy figure of £2 18s. a
week.
The Government has promised a par-
tial restoration of public-service salaries.
Details show that it applies only to men ;
women of 23 and over are still to luxuri-
ate on £2 9s. a week, while those under
23 will receive the proportionately lower
payments they have been getting in the
past two years.
No sane person can contend that a
young woman can keep herself in good
health and provide the clothes which
her position renders necessary on £2 9s.
a week. The usual excuse of the em-
ployer who pays such wages or even less
is that the business girl, as a rule, lives
at home —meaning that her father or
mother subsidises the employer to the
extent of what board and residence
would cost her if she had to pay
for it. Certainly the young woman
whose relatives provide her with food
and a room is comfortably off with
£2 9s. a week to spend on her
clothing and entertainment'; but there
are many girls, in and out of the public
service, who have no such philanthropists
among their relatives. And, in assessing
the value of labor, the fact of a laborer’s
father being a millionaire is no justifi-
cation for underpaying that laborer.
Why men should be singled out for
part-restoration of pay-cuts is beyond
explanation, unless it is that the Govern-
ment wishes to discourage female labor
and drive women back to the home. If it
entertains this notion it had better look
up the census figures, which show that
Melbourne has nearly 63,000 more
females than males. Where the sexes
are so ill-balanced, women must work
or starve or sell themselves. The plea
may be advanced that the Gov-
ernment, by discriminating against
women, is preventing more of them from
taking the bread out of the mouths of the
men and thus interfering with the mar-
riage rate —which, by the way, shows an
advance. All such arguments fail to
stand the test of examination.
Under a properly-organised economy
there should be room for both men
and women in industry. It is
frequently said that there are too
many women doing men’s work; the
truth is that there are too many men
doing work which should properly be
women’s province. Practically all drapers’
work is within the capacity of women.
The girl who taps a typewriter or
agitates an adding machine or fixes
up a card index can do it as well
as the average man, and suffers from no
more nervous strain. In the five years
1923-28 industry could have absorbed
more women workers than applied for
jobs, and is capable of doing it again.
The girls in the Victorian public
service are not engaged in anything
laborious. Apart, perhaps, from the
telephone operators, they are subjected
to no nervous strain. As a whole, the
work they do is work that a man
would scorn to do were he able
to get a job more suited to his tastes.
The plain fact is that the Victorian
Government has denied the girls their
restoration simply because they are not
capable of putting up such a vigorous
fight as the men. They are suffering just
as Binghi made the lubras of the tribe
suffer when they had to take the left-
overs from the kangaroo hunt.
GRASSPAN.


PLAIN ENGLISH.
A New Ruling Class.
A recent London news item is of deep
significance to Australia. It dealt with
the successes of students from high and
grammar schools in examinations for
the civil services of Britain and its depen-
dencies :
The result proves that our future admini-
strators of Empire will be drawn from
an entirely different class.
It is one of those peaceful revolutions
for which the English are famous. When
Continental nations transfer power from
one class to another—a necessary con-
comitant of revolution —they begin by
slaughtering their political opponents,
and follow that up with bloody “purges”
in the ranks of the faithful. The Eng-
lish get similar results by examinations
and elections. Under this system they have
achieved an ex-Laborite, once a paci-
fist, as Prime Minister and civil services
whose younger members have been edu-
cated for the most part at high,
grammar and board schools. The old
hereditary ruling class has been liquidated
by the democratic system as effectively as
it was in Russia by the mass-murder
system.
The old ruling class—composed not
only of Parliamentarians, but of per-
manent officials, who by special know-
ledge born of long experience rule the
nominal heads of Government depart-
ments —believed chiefly in the Empire
and efficient defence. The new ruling
class stands chiefly for such ideals as
social reform, higher and higher educa-
tion for the masses, better and better
housing. Its members are, no doubt, as
patriotic as their predecessors ; but just as
patriotic British Freetraders once thought
that if England showed the way the rest
of the worm would follow suit, so
Britain’s new ruling class thinks that sen-
sible nations will take to pacifism if
England gives them a lead in cutting
down on armaments and spending the
money saved (and a lot over) on the
poor.
So the Militia (or Special Reserve) has
gone and the Territorials have become
the Second Line ; in fact, owing to the
depletion of the Regular Army part of
the T.A. is First Line. The Navy is only
beginning to build up after an eight
years’ rest, being now weaker relatively
than at any time in the past 200 years;
and the enfeebled position of the Air
Force is common knowledge.
Would Britain’s new ruling class, which
begrudges money for the defence of
Britain, and which contains many young
men such as those who voted for the
universities’ anti-war resolutions, spring
to the defence of Australia in an
emergency? As well expect the Russian
ruling class to leap to the defence of a
threatened church.

The New Geography.
f
The Christmas Empire broadcast gave
Australian listeners just that touch of
fun which ought to close every perfect
day. Overseas it must have been arrest-
ing to all those who were following pro-
ceedings with a time chart.
Children frolicked in the Melbourne
Botanical Gardens in the midnight “sun-
shine” —their laughter was heard clearly.
Queensland’s contribution to the voices
of the night was a cattle mob in full
movement at 12.15 a.m., with dogs bark-
ing and horses’ hooves sounding on the
dusty plain like a bit of batten beating
on a fruit-case. There was even a drover
who said “Giddap!” to make his horse
go. A Sydney bridge tollkeeper, a Tas-
manian fisherman and a Westralian
fettler spoke with the same diction and
intonation and type of humor. Triplets,
perhaps.
Unfortunately, only Sydney really en-
joyed the Bondi broadcast—“the glorious
stretch of white beach” and the Christ-
mas Day crowds. (“There must have
been 100,000 people here either sun-
baking or surfing to-day.”) It rained in
Sydney most of the day, and at mid-
night it was cold with a bitter wind ;
but, judging by the sounds which came
over the radio, Bondi beach at midnight
was still full of sunbakers.
The A.B.C. fails to rise to great occa-
sions. Its broadcasts of the air race must
have sent peals of laughter round the
world. One of its “experts”—the an-
nouncer’s own word —in describing the
route mispronounced five European and
Asian names. Allahabad was consis-
tently “Alla6qhad” to one A.B.C. re-
porter. And the Timor Sea, which is
never anything but grey or black or
murky green, became “like Reckitt’s
blue” when an A.B.C. man had gazed
at it from Sydney.
Australian Maps.
Lord Sempill called attention to a job
which badly needs doing when he pointed
out that Australian maps are inadequate
for airmen. They are apt to be slap-
dash affairs when they deal with the
great featureless outback. They have a
habit of taking a season for granted, so
that they sometimes show a large lake
where for most of the year there is only
a flat piece of pasture or claypan. They
show rivers which to anybody used to
real maps look like the Euphrates, and
are really wet-season creeks. And in
some of them helpful names like “Angel’s
Well” or “Horse Creek” are apparently
just stuck, in to fill up vacant spaces.
Compared with the Indian survey
maps, which can be had on every work-
able scale down to an inch to the mile,
with 25-foot contours, they are poor old
things. On these Indian maps every
substantial building is indicated. It will
be years before Australia needs anything
as elaborate, though from a defence
point of view it might be highly useful.
But it does need decent air-route maps.
For any but the highly-experienced navi-
gator to fly across parts of the continent
at present is a far too risky business.

Up to Earle Page.
The Commonwealth Statistician differs
widely from the State authorities in his
estimates of the number of unemployed
in N. S. Wales. The State Minister for
Labor placed the number recently at
24,000 ; the Commonwealth official reck-
oned it in August at 205,000, the total
for Australia being 386,350, or 18 p.c.
of all who depend on work for a living.
However, there is a mighty improvement
in the figures—B7,ooo were put back to
work in 1932 and 95,000 in 1933-34.
The most serious phase of the unem-
ployment problem is the length of time
which thousands of workers have been
idle. In June, 1933, 313,000 had been out
of employment for over a year; 250,000
over two years; 92,000 over four years.
Their replacement in regular jobs can
only be accomplished by private enter-
prise, which is powerless to do much
more while it has to carry its present
load of taxes.
Last year in Parliament Dr. Earle
Page said that
The results of the experiments of all
the Governments in the world in piling on
extra burdens must make it patent to
everyone that improvement can best be
effected by reducing the load on industry
to the greatest possible extent, especially
by reducing taxation.
He wanted £20,000,000 cut off exac-
tions. It would be interesting to know
what he is now doing to have effect given
to his policy. There seem to be no
signs of his hand in the plans of the
Lyons Government.

Kisch and the Jews.
Sydney’s Daniel Levy considers “the
general tone of the article ‘Australian
and Alien Jews’” (B. 19/12/’34) “un-
worthy of The Bulletin”:
“The visit of Herr Kisch is a very unhappy
chapter in the story of the Jews in Australia.”
I do not know whether Kisch is a Jew or not;
but I do know —and I think you know, or
ought to know —that the Jews in Australia have
no concern with his visit to these shores.
The statement that this visit is a “chapter” in
their “story” is a grandiloquent inaccuracy.
“In all these proceedings,” referring to this
man’s objectionable activities, you say “he had
the sympathy and assistance of Jews.” What
evidence have you in support of so serious
an imputation? What Jewish societies or
organisations or individuals of any importance
sympathised with or assisted him in his activi-
ties?
Far be it from me to suggest a taint of anti-
Semitism in The Bulletin, the national Aus-
tralian newspaper. All I say is Non tali auxilio
nec defensoribus istis.
There is no anti-Semitism in The Bul-
letin’s composition, and it has no re-
grets for the publication of an article
which expressed plain facts and honest
convictions. Members of a Jewish asso-
ciation welcomed and supported Herr
Kisch in Melbourne. Its name was given
to representatives of the N.S.W. Jewish
Advisory Council who called at this office
last week; they described it as an off-
shoot from a concern which is negotiat-
ing with the Moscow Government for
the establishment of a Jewish colony in
Russian Asia. The Bulletin is glad to
learn from those gentlemen that their
council and all organisations qualified to
speak for Australian Jews repudiate Herr
Kisch-reject the man and his mission.

An Australian Discovers Port Phillip.
Vic. Governor Huntingfield is just be-
ginning to know his native land. That
is no fault of his, for he left this con-
tinent as a very small boy and returned
only to assume the Governorship of Vic-
toria. There is no such excuse for the
Australian who was brought up here,
knows his own part of the country well
but so fails to appreciate it that he is
quite surprised to find Lord Hunting-
field waxing enthusiastic over the bay-
side beauties of Port Phillip. Those
beauties have been before the eyes of
the Melbournite since he was an infant,
but it is only when they meet the eye of
a stranger that his brain registers the fact
and he looks again, and murmurs “So
it is.”
It is customary for the Melbournite to
despise the glories of his own surround-
ings—for a variety of reasons, the main
one being the proximity to Sydney, prob-
ably the most richly endowed city in the
world in point of beauty of natural sur-
roundings. There are portions of Port
Phillip Bay as beautiful as anything Syd-
ney can boast, but they are only patches,
whereas the whole coast from Barren-
joey to Nowra is a feast of loveliness.
This knowledge, coupled with the fact
that you have to go some miles out of
Melbourne before you see anything but
a stretch of sandy beach, has led the Mel-
bournite to accept the gibe that the sur-
roundings of his city are destitute of
beauty, despite the fact that from Sand-
ringham to the Heads there are miles
upon miles of seascape that would make
the fortunes of resorts in Europe and
United States.
The Riviera at its best is only a few
miles long, and its beauty is largely en-
hanced by the picturesque old buildings
along the cliffs. Ostend is a beach and
nothing more—Fisherman’s Bend can
reveal as much beauty. Dieppe is little
better. The English coastal resorts are
a little worse. Atlantic City is a beach
fronting a swamp. The Golden Gate is
less picturesque than Queenscliff ; Venice,
the site of Hollywood’s seaside revels, is
a dirty stretch of sand covered with hot-
dog stalls.
Compared with the seasides near the
great civilisations of the world, Port
Phillip stands high. And not even Syd-
ney can surpass the wonderful rock
formations of the back beach of Sor-
rento or Portsea, or the glowing green of
the tea-tree at Mornington, with its
shadows of deep purple and its sea, on
a calm, sunny day, gleaming like blue
silk.
If Lord Huntingfield does nothing
more, he has justified his appointment by
telling Melbourne the value of the
beauties which it has failed to recognise.

Germany To-day.
Dr. Keith Barry, from Berlin:
To me it seems a contented and busy
Germany, though Hitler rules with an iron
hand and the censorship is strict. A long
term of imprisonment awaits anyone found
listening to Moscow on a radio set, and those
who are wise are not seen reading English
newspapers too frequently. Some of these
newspapers, notably the “Daily Telegraph,” are
verboten because they have been discussing
Germany with too easy familiarity and, accord-
ing to the Nazis, too little accuracy.
Germans are used to discipline and leader-
ship. After the Kaiser disappeared they lost
these things; with the coming of Hitler they
have once more a national hero and a father
of the people. It is ridiculous to suggest that
90 p.c. of Germany is not behind Hitler.
Especially does he hold the young people in
the hollow of his hand. The children adore
him, wear his uniform, collect for his Winter
Help scheme, say their “Heil, Hitler!” with
enthusiasm, and generally agree that he is the
biggest man in the world to-day.
Is Germany preparing for war? The impres-
sion I receive is that the ordinary German
no more wants war than the ordinary Eng-
lishman. For some years he has seen him-
self defenceless, surrounded by an armed and
hostile camp. On the walls of the State Opera
House in Berlin I saw a map which depicted
Germany in white, with the figures “100,000”
in the middle. Surrounding it were vividly-
colored pictures of other countries stating the
number of armed men at their disposal. Par-
ticularly arresting was the representation of the
great armies to the east, whence Bolshevism
came, and studying it you cannot help feeling
sympathetic with Germany. It has been nar-
nowly saved from Communism, and it wants
to feel sure that it has at its disposal the means
to prevent this menace being spread within its
border.
I find the Germans friendly to the English,
and feel their eagerness to assure one on every
possible occasion that they harbor no ill-
feelings towards the British Empire. But they
hate the French, and the French hate them.
Purely a Gamble.
“Lex”: The most feature of
the Kisch and Naylor cases is that they
are bound to inspire the public with dis-
trust of the law. In both cases eminent
counsel gave conflicting advice, but the
public doesn’t worry much about that
kind of thing. Crown Law offices, jockey
clubs and other authoritarian institutions
are expected to take the blackest view of
suspects, and optimism is as necessary in
a defending counsel as in a doctor.
It is when Judges disagree that lay-
men fall out with the legal system.
In the Kisch and Naylor cases the
public was staggered by the spectacle of
State and Federal Judges contradicting
one another on such seemingly simple
issues as “What is a language?” and
“Has a club power to exclude?” Yet in
each case it was possible for anybody
of intelligence and honesty to take either
view.
Thus a Court of Petty Sessions con-
victed Kisch of being a prohibited immi-
grant under Sec. 5 of the Immi-
gration Act, which requires the suspected
undesirable to write a passage “in an
European language.” What did Parlia-
ment intend? A Court of Petty Ses-
sions, members of the local Gaeltacht and
Starke, J., of the High Court, say, in
effect, that it meant any form of utter-
ance used by people who have dwelt in
Europe in historical times. Rich, J., and
two of his colleagues hold that Parlia-
ment meant a standard European speech
used at the present time for all social
purposes, which, in their judgment, Scot-
tish Gaelic is not. In short, that our lan-
guage test was not intended to be a trick,
but a bona fide test against illiteracy.
Clearly either opinion is capable of
being argued till Doomsday. The same
with the divergent opinions expressed by
eminent N.S.W. Supreme Court Judges
regarding the A.J.C.’s right to warn Rufe
Naylor off Randwick. What worries the
general public is that Kisch wouldn’t be
in Australia and Naylor wouldn’t be free
to bet at Randwick if they hadn’t had the
wherewithal to spend on appeals. The
law’s uncertainties amount to a denial
of justice no less than its delays.
Stuffing the Child Mind.
Rebellion is growing against the exami-
nation system as practised in Australia.
The British method is bad enough, but
it has mitigations. Here, as Dr. Idris
Morgan, a Newcastle (N.S.W.) medical
man, pointed out the other day, though
examinations are gates on the way to the
university, only a small proportion of
students wants to go to a university ; a
smaller proportion still is fitted to go.
A child in most States enters a primary
school and presently finds himself or
herself being shepherded towards a per-
mit-to-enrol test which lets pupils into a
high school. If there are 100 vacancies in
the high school, the first 100 on the
examination lists get in irrespective of
their special tendencies or predilections.
Then they are scourged, urged or forced
through another test called the “inter-
mediate” or a “junior”—in subjects like
Latin, junior mathematics, English,
musical theory and history. It is all
pabulum of the dullest variety, and most
of it can be absorbed best by the lad
with a brain like a blackfellow’s which
remembers but does not think. After
that comes the leaving-certificate exami-
nation or the matriculation.
Out of nine or ten thousand who pass
the intermediate by dint of long, slogging
study, about 300 reach the university.
Many of these become teachers, and
makq other people slog. Others become
lawyers and medical men.
But they cannot study to get a degree
unless they pass a footling memory test
in dead languages, which nine-tenths of
them regard with loathing, and geometry,
which they gulp down like castor oil.
If the editor of the “Sydney Morning
Herald,” or the manager of a big ship-
ping company, or Kingsford Smith de-
cided that it would improve his mind
to take a university degree, all his proved
genius to learn, all his known capacity
to think would avail him nothing unless
he could make a nauseatingly literal
translation of Horace or render the
original of Livy into something which
looked as if it had been written by a
Bengalee statistician.
The thousands who don’t matriculate
set out to sell milk, lick stamps, market
lottery tickets or become bookmakers’
clerks without having gained at school
a tittle of knowledge directly bearing on
their professions. It is a tragic waste of
misapplied ability.
Some day a genius will rise to rebase
education on early tests to determine the
vocational aptitudes and personal am-
bitions of children and direct their train-
ing from the beginning along the avenues
best suited to their types of mind.

"AND IT'S PRINTED WITH WIMBLE'S INKS"
“Martha”: Apropos the dearth of
domestics, I engaged a tall, lean, aggres-
sively genteel old girl a couple of weeks
ago as cook-general. She turned out to
be a poor cook and a hater of house-
work. On the other hand, she claimed
to have been a member of the Govern-
ment House set before the depression ;
she had jilted an A.D.C. for her late hus-
band —a Blud-Punderby. (We called her
Mrs. Blud, by request.) Our little house-
hold was unaware of any friction on
Christmas Day. Mrs. Blud, who had
begun with gloomy comparisons between
our style of living and that of her hus-
band’s people, who had provided “cham-
pagne for one and all in Christmas
Week,” gradually cheered up. She in-
sisted on helping the children with the
Christmas-tree, and knocked it over. Fell
over something in the kitchen and hurt
her knee. Sat down to recover. Brooded
silently for a while, and then swooned,
bearing with her our only bottle of
brandy. Next morning I found a note
anchored to the kitchen table by her
unopened Christmas present.
Mrs. Blank. I have left. Cause—rude
and vulgar conduct by your family. Have
never been overbore or stinted and never
will. Sincerely Mrs. A. Blud-Punderby.
Other cook-generals have reacted simi-
larly to me and mine. What I ask is:
Are we grinders-down of decent workers,
or is there something odd about cook-
generals?

“Tipada”; A launch chugged its way
out of Sydney Harbor the other day on
its annual three-mile pilgrimage, carrying
as cargo over 2000 revolvers and auto-
matics that had been confiscated from
gangsters and others during the previous
12 months. The police take no chance
of any of the armory being recovered ;
before being consigned to 60 fathoms of
ocean each weapon is carefully dis-
mantled, and goes down in sections.

“S.T.S.”: Adelaide, used to spinning
along on bitumen roads, has been aston-
ished to find how wild is the country just
off them, in the hills at its back door.
A woman and her four children were
found dead in their home at Mylor. The
husband, a noted axeman at shows, had
cycled away into the scrub with a gun,
and persistent search by the police has
failed to find him. They think that he
is dead ; but local residents say that the
old goldmines and caves along the Onka-
paringa might hide a man indefinitely.

“Koonanglebah”; Some earnest indi-
vidual is trying to have the Banfield bun-
galow on Dunk Island preserved as a
memorial. There is very little to pre-
serve ; I stayed in the house for a week
over two years ago, and it was then
showing signs of decay. Banfield’s best
memorial is just beside the house, the
cairn under which his body lies. In any
case, the idea of preserving the house as
a memorial while a £30,000 tourist hostel
is being built on the island sounds a
trifle ironical. The idea of Dunk as a
tourist resort was one of Banfield’s night-
mares.

“Blackstone”: How’s this for legal red-
tape? In a Westralian court letters of
administration of the estate of a bache-
lor who had died intestate at 24 were
applied for by the father, who made an
affidavit that he and his wife (“the law-
ful mother of the deceased”) were the
only persons entitled to share. The affi-
davit was rejected on the ground that
“the Court must be satisfied that father
and mother of deceased were both of 21
years of age—affidavit does not disclose
this.” Fortunately the presumption that
the parents (or one of them) may have
been born after their offspring was re-
garded as being rebuttable. With due
solemnity a further affidavit was sworn
and with due formality filed.

“Bill ’Awkins”: Thomas Atkins has
always regarded himself as irresistible
with the ladies. The War Office is evi-
dently of the same opinion, for, warned
by the experience of the Occupationary
force in the Rhine provinces after the
war, it has banned all marriages be-
tween soldiers of the Saar expedition
and German women. Anyone infringing
the order forfeits all army marriage
allowances and privileges, and the wives
will not be taken on the regimental
strength when the show is over. Accord-
ing to an official report, many of the
marriages contracted during the Rhine

“And who are you?”

the popular opinion that it was the liberal
and appetising ration scale of the British
troops rather than love at first sight
which swept the frauleins off their feet.

“L. 1.8.”; Not all the Australian Light
Horse had the sword added to their
equipment in the Palestine campaign (B.
19/12/’34). The Anzac Mounted Divi-
sion (Australians and Maorilanders) de-
clined the sticker. Their reason was that
as they had, practically single-handed,
flung the Turk back at Romani and
then shifted him out of Sinai by succes-
sive kicks at Bir el Abd, Magdhaba and
Rafa with the aid of rifle and bayonet
only, they didn’t need any addition to
their armory. The Australian M.D. did
adopt the toothpick, and did some good
work with it.

“M.H.E.”: I thank “Grapeshot” (B.
19/12/’34) most heartily for the informa-
tion that in Ernest Wells’s “Brave Music”
the description of Tom Price’s “fire low
and Iqy them out!” was based on a, real
incident, but I think he misunderstands
me. I know all about that incident, but
I still say that Mr. Wells’s account of
it sounds as if it had been written by
some stranger who had seen a French
revolution. Moreover, if this description
of the prototype of Tom Price on parade
sounds real to anybody who knew him,
I’ll eat my shako:
Phough. The Colonel spat and, smacking
his white gloves on his scarlet-seamed
thigh, swung into his creaking saddle.
That has the “Boys’ Own Paper” touch
of which I complained in my review of
the book. Price had the kindest heart
alive and the manners of any well-bred
British staff officer.

“C.F.A.”; Even in this country the
Gaelic is by no means a dead language
(B. 19/12/’34). I know of several old
people who can still talk it, given a
chance. In my young days my parents
used it to prevent little pitchers hearing
matters not intended for them. Forty
years ago a Gaelic service was held regu-
larly in a kirk on the Manning River
(N.S.W.), and was well attended by the
numerous Scots in the district.

“Chirurgeon”: Those Bulletin corre-
spondents who have been discussing
haemophilia can sleep easy. Research
work by the School of Tropical Medi-
cine, St. Bart.’s Hospital and the people in
charge of the reptiles in London Zoo has
resulted in the fixation of a substance
which instantly stops the fatal bleeding.
The new remedy is derived from snake
venom. It has long been known that the
poisons of the two great divisions of
the poison snakes, the colubrine and the
viperine, differ widely in their toxic pro-
perties. The colubrine kills by paralys-
ing the nerve centres, the viperine by
rapid coagulation of the blood. Inves-
tigators have separated the coagulating
principle—so powerful that a solution of
one in 100,000 of water will stop bleed-
ing. The substance has already been
successfully tested, a surprising number
of haemophilia cases answering the call
for volunteers. Most of these to date are
dental cases, extraction of teeth having
been in the past out of the question for
“bleeders.” The new styptic should
prove a blessing wherever obstinate
bleeding is involved, especially as no
unpleasant results follow its application.

“M.G.”: Melbourne G.P.O. chimes
have put up a record something like
that of “Mademoiselle of Armentieres.”
They have not been played for 26
years, but this New Year they are once
more to be agitated for the delectation
of a new generation. When some
foolish State Minister instituted the
chimes many years ago, Melburnians
laughed heartily at the weird noise, but
the joke soon began to pall and the
chimes were discontinued. They were
ridiculous affairs from the outset. The
bells are far from musical in tone,
and after about two bars they arc sud-
denly cut off —like the radio tune which
ceases in order that the announcer may
tell you all about flea powder. After
26 years the tone is not likely to be
improved.

“Selma”: Time must have mitigated
the crime of writing private notes on
royal notepaper (B. 12/12/’34). Cosmo
Hamilton tells that when once at Wind-
sor Castle he seized the opportunity to
pen lines to several clamorous creditors
on paper branded with the impressive
address. He suffered no after-unpleasant-
ness ; on the contrary, the paper had
the desired effect on his tailor and others
concerned.

“P. Said”: The chairman of the Orient
line told the N. S. Wales Travel League
last week of a friend who boasted that
he had never eaten a meal ashore during
an ocean voyage. This man should have
remained in Dultown-on-the-Ooze, or
whatever it was. I have nothing to say
against the elaborate meals supplied on
modern liners, except that one gets sick
of them. There are other reasons for
shunning ships’ dining-saloons in port;
most ports are hot, and ships’ lower
decks are stuffy in the ports of cold coun-
tries. Stewards expect passengers to go
ashore, and show it. And there is the
loneliness factor. Strange ports have a
charm which is all their own. The food
may be poor, but it is rich with novelty.
I would rather eat Colombo fish at the
Galle Face than Scotch salmon on a
liner. The new surroundings, human and
otherwise, are strangely exciting. To
travel and miss the trips ashore is like
going to the races and saving money by
not buying a book.

“Marley”: Another wom^sJ? as been
hanged in England, the fi.yo+’or eight
years. She was a husband-poisoner, and
there doesn’t seem to have been much
to say in her favor, except that she was
a grandmother at 42. There was the
usual hysterical last-minute
agitation to save her from the
gallows, including an appeal to
the King and Queen. One
plea advanced in favor of
mercy was the fact that it was
Christmastime. It failed to
move the Home Secretary—it
would have set an amazing
precedent had it done so.

“Der Jong”: Commenting
on the recent wines exhibition
in London, the “Morning
Post” asks why these wines
should not bear native names
instead of those of French
types. “At regimental dinners,
for instance,” it remarks,
“Empire wines would be the
very thing; toasts might be
honored in Toowoomba and
Stellenbosch.” Passing by
Toowoomba, Stellenbosch is a
bad pick—for regimental din-
ners. The Cape university
town was a vast horse and
mule depot during the Boer
War. Thither were sent all
the dud officers not quite bad
enough to be thrown out alto-
gether. To be “Stellenbosched” carried
a sinister meaning in British military
vernacular, and one that has survived
even to this day.

“D.’s” dream;
If I were rich I would buy and endow Eliza-
beth Bay House and give it to N. S. Wales, the
only stipulation being a law safeguarding its
harbor view. The Old World has many of these
object-lessons in how former generations lived
—Hampton Court, Versailles, and so on —but
they suffer from the same trouble as Vaucluse
House: museum atmospheres. I would furnish
every room in Elizabeth Bay House from attic
to basement according to the style of' 1830.
Faked furniture for the most part, but none the
worse for that. The Art Gallery would prob-
ably supply many of the pictures from its
early-Victorian discards. The aim wouldn’t
be beauty; solely representationalism. A faith-
ful picture of the sort would become increas-
ingly useful to succeeding generations as
houses gave way increasingly to flats in sky-
scrapers, and it would have other values.
Imagine the joy of inspecting a house identi-
cally the same in every particular as one that
might have been lived in by the elder Pitt, or
Pepys, or Bacon!

A gangster for whom the Syracuse police

TO THE NEW YEAR.
We have seen the Old Year out and away,
Over the lintel and down the drive.
What have you got in your wallet, eh?
What are you bringing us, ’Thirty-five?
Do you mark the dawn of a fairer day,
A truce to passions that rend and rive,
To jarring faction and futile fray?
The world still hums, like an angry hive,
From steel-ringed Europe to far Cathay.
Will you heal the bitterness, ’Thirty-five?
Our leaders grope, as the blind astray;
Like beasts of burden they strain and strive,
Hither and thither they bend and sway
Till only despots, it seems, survive.
Little but platitudes some convey,
Nothing but formulas most contrive.
Will you lighten care and unrest allay,
And loosen trade from the cramping gyve,
Till sunshine scatters the clouds of gray,
Till peace and plenty once more arrive?
Will y.ou straighten a world in disarray
Till high and humble alike may thrive?
Step in, young chap, and your wares display.
We’re hoping much of you, sakes alive!
What have got in your wallet, pray,
Or your bulging swag, as a man might say?
What are you bringing us, Thirty-five?

“Under the N.S.W. Charitable Collections Act
the thriving business of selling shares in lottery
tickets is to be banned. ‘Our number is up on
January 5, but I am still cheerful, says Mi.
Whiddon.”
A book of tickets one could subdivide,
A snow-fringed headpiece featured far and wide
Combining shrewdness with benevolence.
And little wonder one was home-and-dned.
There’s none who dealt with us was sold a pup,
Yet from our lips at last is snatched the cup.
Our job is branded illegitimate;
In goes our alley and our number’s up.
A blow at honest trade! Behold, in proof,
The joints, deserted now from floor to roof.
From where so long our stirring slogans flew
To part the speculator from his oof.
We were the poor man’s friends, be sure of that.
Where could he buy, save only where we sat,
A chance of affluence for a humble bob,
A glimpse of Eldorado for a sprat?
I sometimes think that daily heav’nward sped
Some glowing benison on Zella’s head,
That lots of splosh which came the toiler’s
way .a
Was dropped into his kick by Lucky Fred.
And that quaint Chow whose light was seldom
dim,
Now that authority has dowsed our glim
Where will believers in the occult go
To seek the magic that they found in him?
We made our hay in stacks while shone the sun.
And. though our dash is obviously done,
At least there’s solid comfort in the thought
We’ve had a mighty profitable run.

“Fray Bentos”: That N.S.W. school-
teacher who trotted out at the annual
powwow the old bogey about child-sweat-
ing in the cow-cockies’ country doesn’t
know the value of such early-morning
training. There was a chap in my bat-
talion nicknamed “Sunlight” because
whenever “stand-to” was on or zero hour
was due he was always the most wide-
awake Digger in the mob. Queried as to
his unusual accomplishment, he put us
wise as follows: “If you blighters had
milked as many cows from three to four
in the morning as I have, from the day
when I had strength enough to pull at
Strawberry’s canteen, you’d be blanky
well awake now through second nature.”
After that we always felt safe enough to
snooze against our rifles in the hours
before the dawn if “Sunlight” was any-
where near.

“El V.”: I am imbibing an extra
drink for a lad who is having a more
miserable Christmas and New Year than
he might have had. Filled with a laud-
able ambition to spend the festive season
in the free, open air instead of in a cell
at Pentridge he made a miniature blow-
pipe, a hacksaw frame, with saws to fit,
a glasscutter and a grappling-iron, and
“Oh, Clarence! Not in public!”
secreted a few feet of rope in a tin of
jam. It was his simple plan to cut out a
window and bars, hook the other side of
the drawbridge with his grapple and
crawl the tight rope over three yawning
gaps to freedom. An untimely deputa-
tion of warders who valued his society
waited on him, however, and demanded
that he should remain with them for an-
other six or seven years, which seems all
too hard on an adventurous spirit. Hired
out to an enterprising author in search
of another Jack Sheppard or Robinson
Crusoe he should be a goldmine.

As “10-2-4” looks at it:
When a crime of phenomenal hideousness
occurs the dailies star it in unison.
Mother Butchers Children.
Exclusive Photos, of Fatal Axe.
I withdraw my gaze from such items as
carefully as I do from the victims of a car
crash, and my experience is that 75 p.c. of
people do the same. They revolt all but a
handful of congenital sadists —those who would
attend executions if the law permitted. This is
the kind of scoop that would make me buy a
paper:—
Desperate Parent’s Recovery.
Mr. Simpson Goes Solvent.
There would be an inside account of Mr.
S.’s struggles against adversity, incorporating
insulting letters from creditors, threats of prose-
cution by the Income-tax Commissioners, repro-
ductions of writs and judgment summonses,
photos, of the revolver with which Simpson
meditated blowing his brains out. And then,
in lyric journalese, the Turn of the Tide. Simp-
son’s unexpected rise from the slough. The
lunch at the Australia with his bank manager.
What he wrote to the income-tax people.
Tens of thousands would be as interested to
hear how Simpson did it as he would be to tell
the story.

“Colonel Bungstarter”; My old friend
Jack Hamilton (B. 19/12/’34) concealed
under a rather grim exterior a boyish
love of practical joking. An early
Federal Government, desiring to popu-
larise rifle clubs, offered a substantial
reward for the discovery of an automatic,
self-registering target. One Sunday after-
noon Major Bill Pinnock, Queensland
Supervisor of Rifle Clubs, called on
Hamilton, then staying at a Mary-
borough (Q.) hotel, and found him sitting
alone on the balcony. “Bill,” said Jack
in his quiet voice, “I’ve got that target
all right.” “Gripes!” replied Bill;
“you’ve made your fortune. Let’s have
a look at it.” “Sit down, and I’ll show
you,” said Jack, spreading a newspaper
across his knees. A portly and dignified
citizen strolled past along the opposite
pavement; Hamilton whipped an air
pistol from under the newspaper, planted
a pellet on the citizen’s sit-down and in-
stantly had the weapon back under the
paper. The stung pedestrian clapped a
hand to the stricken spot, wheeled and
made after an innocent small boy. “Auto-
matic and self-registering, Bill,” mur-
mured Hamilton ; “but not commercially
practicable, I’m afraid.”

“Scribe”; The old Julia Percy, once
the pride of inter-State passenger boats,
will shortly be taken out to Bass Strait
to be sunk. In the long ago, the Julia
Percy was something that stood supreme
as a means of transit between Melbourne
and Sydney and Adelaide. Before rail-
way lines connected the capitals, there
were many boats but only one Julia
Percy; to travel on her had’a distinc-
tion of its own. The Julia was so popu-
lar that she had to be lengthened. Then
she met with disaster and, on being sal-
vaged, became a hulk, giving good ser-
vice until her arteries were found too
hardened even for that humble purpose.
The Edina, for her part, is still going
strong. She is so old that she carried
soldiers to and from England to the
Crimea, and she has been “wrecked” a
score of times, but always comes up
smiling. It is 30 years since I was rowed
out at midnight to a reef in Port Phillip
Bay to climb up the deck of the Edina,
then at an angle of 45 degrees. She was
piled up solidly while the Manawatu,
which had given her a bump, was lying
on the sandy bottom off Williamstown.
“ Hereafter , an it please you, will I choose my own apparel.”
“That’s the last of the Edina,” people
said, but within a week or so she was
rolling past the plant erected to bring
the Manawatu to the surface. The oldest
commissioned vessel afloat, the Edina is
the Wandering Jew of the ocean.

“Ech de Schulzbach”: “M. Turlutu”
(B. 19/12/’34) wants the Health Depart-
ments to investigate and discover a cure
for the after-effects of ’flu. It is a good
deal to ask, seeing that anyone who could
but demonstrate the bacteriological cause
of influenza would be a sure bet for the
Nobel Prize, Influenza is the king epi-
demic disease, and shows no signs of
being ousted from that position. The
pandemic of 1918-19 swept over the
world ; its death-toll is believed to have
outstripped the total number of deaths in
the war. Yet, while there are dozens of
anti-war leagues which get a steady
revenue from subscriptions, there are no
anti-’flu brigades.
* * * *
“Rag and Bone”: There has been a
fearful commotion in the senior service
clubs over the announcement by the War
Office that the entire Second Cavalry
Brigade is to be mechanised. The experi-
ment has been tried with squadrons in
individual regiments; now comes this
shattering shock. According to the
sketch of the scheme available, horses
will be replaced with two-seater armored
cars. (That will solve one old problem,
anyway—the finding of suitable re-
mounts.) Worse even than that, the
Royal Horse Artillery, which looks upon
Guardees, even, as miserable earthlings,
is to have its beloved steeds, the
cream of the army’s horseflesh, replaced
by tractors. It was previously decided
to replace the cunning little 14-pounder
guns, so ornamental in a gallop past and
so useless in action, by 4.7 howitzers. As
these are too heavy for horseflesh, the
change was inevitable. Truly the service
has at last fulfilled the prophecies of
many generations of soldiermen and gone
to the Devil.

“Binduli”; John Scaddan, of West-
ralia, who died recently, was an engine-
driver on the Golden Mile, and a tempor-
arily unemployed one, when Brownhill
was allotted a member in the Leg. Assem-
bly. It occurred to somebody that Scad-
dan, already known as a breezy speaker,
would be a good man to fill the bill. A
hastily organised deputation set out to
seek its man, and ran him down (the
story went) in a cool-drinks shop, where
Scaddan, a lifelong teetotaller, was
gloomily pondering his future over a
long-sleever of horehound or some such
innocuous beverage. Would h'e allow his
name to be submitted for the Labor
nomination? was asked. Would a duck
swim? That was at the end of 1904.
Within half a dozen years Scadaan had
become leader of the party vice T. .H.
Bath, who had resigned the job ; within
seven years he was Premier, with a major-
ity such as no Westralian Government
ever had before. But it wasn’t all smooth
sailing in his early Parliamentary years.
In one of the periodical debates over the
raising of members’ salaries, Scaddan
told the House how he had once arrived
in his electorate from Perth, on some
party business, with exactly half a crown
in his pocket and no very clear idea
where his next meal was coming from.

“Hoplite”: Touching the use and mis-
use of military titles, “Jeames” seems to
be still moving in an atmosphere of May-
fair and mutton-chop whiskers when he
recalls the hoary gibes of “Punch” at
the expense of volunteer officers (B.
12/12/’34), After a war which demon-
strated the worth of the latter, all refer-
ences to the practice of the Romans
and current snobbery are out of place.
Citizen military officers earn their titles no
less than their professional brethren, and
to attempt distinction between them is a
poor recognition of services _ rendered
cheerfully and without ostentation. There
are no geographical military titles in Aus-
tralia, as in America. No Australian
colonel is ever likely to be placed in
the position of “Colonel” House, who
once had to explain to the Kaiser's
generals that he was never in the army
and was ignorant of its practices. I doubt
if “Jeames” will make Australia any safer
for democracy by his desire to abolish
titular distinctions between, say, a com-
pany promoter and a company com-
mander.

“Scribe”: “Trunk murders,” such as
periodically occur in _ Europe and
America, are rather rare in this country.
It is more than a generation since the
body of a woman was found in a trunk
on Circular Quay, Sydney; and the
notorious boot-trunk tragedy which
agitated Victoria for over six weeks oc-
curred in 1899, Perhaps neither was,
strictly speaking, a murder case, the
victims having died from illegal opera-
tions, though in the Sydney instance the
offender was hanged for his participa-
tion. The Yarra horror was intensified
by the fact that the girl was not
identified for weeks. Her identity might
never have come to light had not another
young woman who took part in the dis-
posal of the body been impelled to tell the
story. She first confided in one of her
boy friends, but the reward of £5OO didn’t
tempt him, and he advised her to keep
her mouth shut. She obeyed for a fort-
night ; then confided in another boy
friend, this time with disastrous results,
which led to her being put in the dock
and escaping punishment only by turn-
ing Queen’s evidence.

POLITICAL POINTS
When Lang was performing the Com-
monwealth Bank charged 6 per cent, to
discount Treasury bills. The rate fell
to 4 per cent, immediately he was
thrown out, and there have been steady
cuts since, the latest to 1| per cent. It
takes effect on January 1, and on bills
outstanding will mean an annual saving
of £82,000 to N. S. Wales and of £57,000
to the rest of the States.
The Government at Canberra tried to
stop the two youngsters who flew from
N. S. Wales to Maoriland in a land
machine, and talked sourly of a prosecu-
tion. While thus engaged it was backing
the projected trans-Pacific flight of poor
U!m and his companions—in a land
machine. Martens, M.H.R., has drawn
attention to this odd coincidence.
The first section of the northern high-
way along the Queensland coast has
been called Bruce, after a Labor Minister
of that name. Unfortunately trippers
from Melbourne are taking the bloom
off the compliment, as it were, by saying
it is awf’ly nice of the Government to
pay such a tribute to dear Mr. Bruce
in London.
“S. M. Herald” notes with obvious
admiration that the N.S.W. Parliament
passed 60 bills last year. That’s nothing;
since the beginning of the century it has
placed over 1600 Acts on the statute
book, and the bureaucracy has created
about 15,000,000 regulations. All that is
of any real value in these could be con-
tained in one comfortable-sized volume,
instead of in 48, as at present.
According to “Granny,” there was
“great hilarity” among Assemblymen
before the N.S.W. Parliament closed up
for the year.
Mr. A. E. A. E. V. Reid (Manly) was
showered with paper missiles. He was
quietly reading on the back Ministerial
benches when copies of “Hansard,” news-
papers and business papers were thrown at
him from all quarters. He joined in the
general merriment.
Then simple things do amuse simple
minds,
British Labor, which used to take Rus-
sian money for newspaper propaganda,
is “profoundly shocked and alarmed at
the widespread summary executions in
Russia,” and suggests that “arrested
persons should have public trials and
opportunities for legal defence.” This
must have enlivened the Christmas of
the ruling gang in Russia, whose one
remedy for opposition, whether from
Czarists, borjoice or ex-members of the
gang, is a bullet through the heart or
brain.
“Scratch a Russian and you find a
Tartar,” said the early-Victorians. Though
greatly ridiculed now, they knew their
Muscovite better than heaps of Georgians
do.
The secretary of the N.S.W. “leger”
bookmakers protests that it is “opposed
to the ethics of taxation” to compel his
union to pay |d. on each betting ticket
it issues regardless of the amount
staked—perhaps Is. “The ethics of
taxation”! Surely the gentleman should
have learned by now that there is no
such thing.
Butler says he is going to raise the
question of Government lotteries at the
next Premiers’ conference. His State
doesn’t go in for lotteries, but it has
them east and west. Victoria is exempt
from them on the west, but they rage
to the north and south. If Australia
must have lotteries and must raise loans,
it could combine the two —or, better still,
issue premium bonds —without indulging
in a shabby competition which is unfair
to the two States remaining out of it.
N.S.W. Speaker Levy is not to be
turned down by the U.A.P., but he had
a mortal struggle to retain the party
nomination. The voting was 458 for
Levy and 381 for Buttered. Had it been
459 for Buttered, just on one-thirtieth of
the electors who were for Levy at the
last contest for Woodahra would Ijave
decided the fate of a man who has been
33 years in Parliament and has been
Speaker five times. Veterans like Levy
and Bavin must go out of politics
some time, but small cliques should not
be privileged to kick them out.
MOVING DAY.
The effectiveness of the N. S. Wales
Charitable Collections Act is illustrated
by the haste with which sellers of shares
in lottery tickets propose to move to
Canberra. It will do them no good ;
their operations will still be illegal in
N. S. Wales. It is alleged that the Queens-
land Government is angling for the ser-
vices of some of them ; but Forgan Smith
is not such a fool as all that.
Malaria is raging in Ceylon, and the
dead (some of them Europeans) exceed
2000. It may possibly have reached the
cinnamon isle from Australia, where a
rare and rapid form of the disease
scourged the northern abos., from West
Kimberley round to Cape York—with-
out sparing white teamsters or station-
hands —10 or 12 months ago. Apropos,
a grasshopper invasion of western U.S.A.
preceded the one infesting four Austra-
lian States. The possibility that the flying
machine may be spreading pests and pes-
tilences, even where there is no direct
communication, should not be over-
looked. In this matter, as in others, Aus-
tralia’s defences are weak.
Depression has increased the maldis-
tribution of the sexes in Victoria which
began in the nineties of last century,
when thousands of young fellows left
for Westralian and Queensland goldfields
and did not come back. Census figures
show that Melbourne, with a population
of 991,934 (doubtless a million now), had,
on June 30, 62,384 more females than
males, and provincial districts (198,191)
8611 more; in rural areas, however,
males (342,233) outnumbered females by
55,908. One effect of centralisation is
that lovely woman predominates in all
the cities, but most of all in Melbourne.
A Hitler dodge introduced into the
Saar referendum must have filled the
Australian-born chief of the Commis-
sion with thoughts of home. Thousands
of persons who were Saarlanders at the
time of the Treaty of Versailles, and are
thereby eligible to vote, are being
pumped into the area in special trains
from Germany to swing the ballot for
the Nazi cause. It is a change from
starting public works in the neighbor-
hood or putting thousands of new hands
on the railways, after the grand old
Queensland fashion.
Out of the emergency fund or some-
thing Lyons and co. are distributing
£5OOO among the Tas. berry-growers—
through the State Government again.
Hitherto, it is explained, their “surpluspro-
duction” went to Britain, but the British
demand has slumped, and the price with
it. Sydney and Brisbane would buy Tas.
gooseberries and raspberries if they
could get them, but they can’t. Bounty-
feeding fruitgrowers with unexploited
home markets (the N. S. Wales orange-
growers are to get two bounties) is
a feckless business, but the politicians
can think of no alternative.
Another ardent Westralian patriot
reared in another clime and somewhat
stricken in years has been heard from.
J D. Connolly, sometime Col. Sec. and
Agent-General, assures the “Morning
Post” that if the oppressed State (he
quitted it 17 years ago) is denied the right
to leave the Federation it will “walk
out.” If it does, it will leave without
£750,000 or so of Commonwealth grant
and Federal-aid road money, and it will
have to find out of its own re-
sources interest on the State debt, interest
on its share of the war-debts, military,
old-age and invalid pensions, defence ex-
penditure and sinking-fund payments, be-
sides making up all the losses on its
group- and soldier-settlements. But no
matter ; Connolly will be thinking of if
in his expensive London home.
Commonwealth Minister Paterson is
anxious to have a word with Dr. Duguid,
of Adelaide, who at a Presbyterian Fel-
lowship Conference in that city made
harrowing assertions about the treatment
of blacks by whites. Beginning on the
note that “the shooting and poisoning
of natives in the past” were “too horrible
to recall,” the doctor said he had a
photograph of a black boy poisoned this
year (he recovered) by drinking from his
own rockhole.
The wife of a missionary admitted that an
aboriginal, if considered a nuisance, could
be dispatched in any out-of-the-way spot,
and that was the end of it.
If the gentleman has any evidence the
wonder is that he didn’t forward it to
Paterson or the police instead of wait-
ing to cause a “sensation” at the confer-
ence.
Maddocks, the N.S.W. Transport Com-
missioner, has discovered that the trolley-
’buses tried in Sydney are efficient and
economical, but still thinks trams are
“the most economical means of trans-
porting large masses of people.” London's
Transport Board evidently disagrees
with him. It owns 5594 motor-’buses and
-coaches, operating over nearly 3000
miles of route, and 2518 tramcars, which
serve 327 miles, and it is scrapping and
removing tramlines from almost the
whole north-western sector of London
(Euston - Enfield ; Paddington - Camden
Park; Shepherd’s Bush-Uxbridge, and
Hammersmifh-Hampton Court). These
lines serve far larger masses of people
than Mr. Maddocks has to accommo-
date* but they are to be replaced with
trolley-’buses.
Queensland grows about enough
wheat for its own needs; Westralia
grows a large surplus for export, the sale
of which, though unprofitable to the
farmer, has strengthened Australia’s
financial position abroad. When there
is sufficient Queensland wheat on hand,
imports from other States are forbidden,
despite the constitutional provision for
inter-State Freetrade ; in the result the
Queensland grower has for years been
getting about a shilling a bushel more
than the Westralian grower. Yet last
year, out of the Commonwealth bounty,
Queensland growers without taxable in-
come received ss. 6d. an acre and West-
ralian growers 3s. 6d. an acre, with a
small payment to come. Such things
can be when a Government careless of
its own Constitution raises money by
taxation and hands it to other Govern-
ments to spend.
Many changes will be necessary in the
N.S.W. Police Department when Com-
missioner Childs retires. Perhaps the
opportunity will be taken to find Ser-
geant Lawrence a post more suited to
his talents. Sergeant Lawrence was in
charge of a raiding squad with which
he descended upon a firm of Sydney
business agents, seizing their papers. Dis-
charged by a jury, they brought a civil
action, and the Government had to settle
it. Henry, M.L.A., who was a witness,
has described the thing in Parliament as
“the most scandalous case of unlawful
entry and high-handed action by the
police I have ever heard of,” and he
assents that “Sergeant Lawrence and his
brilliant gang of police detectives have
cost the country £30,000.”
The tide has turned against the Minor-
ity Movement on the N.S.W, northern
coalfields. Jack, northern president of the
union for a twelvemonth, has been ousted
by “Bondy” Hoare, who held the job
from 1922 to 1933. With 3099 votes
“Bondy” had an absolute majority of
761 over three other candidates.


BACK FROM A SAVAGE LAND.
“A stowaway on the Barrabool explained in a London court that he had a dreadful time mixing with riff-raff in Australia, so decided to attempt to get Home
while my morals were still secure.' Police, journalists and court officials were so maved that they took up a collection for him.”

Vice-Admiral Glossop, C. 8., who com-
manded the Sydney when the Emden met
her doom, was a suave, bald, soft-voiced
little man who looked the antithesis of
a fire-eater. He had been associated
with N. S. Wales for nearly 30 years,
off and on, when he married one of the
daughters of John McPhillamy, a
Bathurst (N.S.W.) solicitor, in 1918. Glos-
sop could have stood off and blown the
Emden out of the water without danger
to the Sydney, but, being a congenital
sportsman, he came in and made a fight
of it. Or so his critics said after the
engagement. He joined the Union Club
when he joined the Sydney in 1914, and
remained an overseas member till his
death last week at 64.
“Exdig”: L. St. G. Grondona (B.
26/12/34) made a picturesque descent on
London. He was chief clerk at Sydney
Repat. ; when it was assailed by a Sydney
paper, he resigned his job and re-
plied in a one-day paper written by him-
self which sold out at 3d. per copy. With
the profits and the value of his com-
muted war pension, he left for England.
On his first Sunday in London he made
a speech in Hyde Park on Empire de-
velopment which attracted newspaper
attention, and he hasn’t looked back
since.
Firmin McKinnon, of Brisbane
“Courier-Mail,” who is off to S’Africa
as one of the Empire Press Union dele-
gates, used to be editor of Brisbane
“Courier.” He was its leader-writer and
book reviewer for 20 years. Since the
merger he has been associate-editor, with
reviewing as a sideline. His literary lec-
tures are equal to anything of the sort
that is being done in this part of the
world. Many of them, incidentally, have
been on S’Africa’s remarkable school of
novel-writers. /
“Roman” fakes off his hat:
In Rev. George Tait, who died in Melbourne
last week aged 90, the Presbyterians have lost
the ideal clergyman. Age makes some men con-
servative ; at 88 Tait was able to stand up for
Dr. Angus against the fundamentalists. The
average cleric, whatever his age or creed may
be, sticks to the literature of his denomination;
Tait once staggered a Presbyterian Assembly
by pointing an argument with a quotation from
Francis Thomson, the Catholic poet ; And he
was a true sportsman, with that passionate love
for cricket which one often finds in the best
Scots —Barrie and Andrew Lang, for example.
His main aim, however, was to be a consistent
Christian, and those who knew him agree that
he brought the miracle off.
The late Annie Golding was Australia’s
first articulate suffragette and a very
early member of the A.L.P. The holder
of a 1A certificate, she was headmistress
of schools all over N. S. Wales, and
wherever she went she worked hard as
a feminist, an educationist and a
Laborite. She had an accident six weeks
ago and, though over 80, seemed to be
recovering; but there was a relapse, and
she died last week in Lewisham Hos-
pital. A bonnie fighter, yet she never
made a lasting enemy, being a true be-
liever in all the causes she took up.
“Jeames”: Sir Francis Colchester-
Wemyss, manager of the English Test
croquet team of four which arrived in
Sydney last week, was here six years ago
in a similar capacity. He has been, com-
pared with the late Colonel Newnham-
Davis as an authority on food, so when
he classes Australian and M.L. women
with Frenchwomen as “natural cooks”
Australian and M.L. men may gasp but
they can’t object. He has probably tried
his hand at as many sports and hobbies
as anybody in England, and he excels
at some of them —notably dry fly-
fishing and the rare art of tying a fly.
He is 63, and got his K.B.E. for Red
Cross work.
The Rev. Thomas Quinton, of St.
Mark’s (C. of E.), Leopold (Vic.), is one
of the oldest working clergymen in the
world, and it is doubtful if any clergy-
man can claim to have toiled so long in
the one diocese. He is 87 ; he has served
at Leopold for 28 years, and the whole
of his 60 years in the ministry has been
spent in the Melbourne diocese.
From London:
If George Arliss gets a knighthood in the
New Year honors it will be a compliment to
the American as well as to the English stage.
When he played the Rajah in “The Green
Goddess” at London St. James’s in 1921 he
had been a New York star for 22 years. Yet
he has always had houses in England (in
London at Maida Vale, in the country at
Wealdstone), he has never picked up a trace
of an American accent, and any foreigner who
aspersed England could rely pn a thunderous
rebuke from the little man. His personal popu-
larity is enormous. The Garrick is the most
exclusive club in London in a sense; a candidate
isn’t elected till a given number of members
of his own profession write supporting him.
Under this arrangement some aspirants remain
in the plight of Mahomet’s tomb for years.
Arliss got his quota inside 24 hours. His father
was a London publisher, and his mother is
said to have been a Jewess. Though he has
never been in Australia, he has several Aus-
tralian pictures, and among them three Norman
Lindsavs.
DR. DOWNEY, R.C. Aren bishop of Liverpool.
Dr. Downey is a curious amalgam;
he was born in Ireland, he talks like an
Englishman, and he has a type of face
which is often seen in Spaniards of
ancient lineage. Spanish men and Irish
women intermarried considerably three
or four centuries ago, so the Arch-
bishop may well have the blood of hidal-
goes in his veins. He has made a great
hit with the Sydney public, as much by
his courtly manners as by his platform
wit and wisdom.
“Old-timer”: Two of the best and
gamest amateur horsemen N. S. Wales
has known died last week —Bill Gosper
(79), of Windsor, and John Ryan (93), of
Balmain. Gosper won a cup for ama-
teurs presented by the Governor (Lord
Augustus Loftus) at the first meeting ever
held at Randwick. His mount was T. S.
Clibborn’s Esmore. Other sportsmen
whose colors he wore were Bill Long,
M.L.C. (owner of Grand Flaneur), and
Pat Osborne, of Currandooley, father of
the A.J.C. committeeman and owner.
John Ryan also rode at Randwick when
there were plenty of events for amateurs,
and he was a noted cross-country per-
former. His father was a Nepean pioneer
who had hunted in Ireland. There is a
local legend that the old man rode over
the gates of Government House, Parra-
matta, and was instantly followed by
John on a pony.
D. D. Trood moves on from Christ
College (Tas.) to Adelaide Scotch. He
was educated at Caulfield (Vic.), T.T.C.
(Melbourne) and Melbourne and Hobart
’Varsities. Also he got a rowing blue,
and won swimming and track trophies.
Dr. E. N. McQueen, who has taken
his M. 8.8.5. at Sydney Uni., is a Vic-
torian. After becoming an M.A. of Mel-
bourne Uni. he collected a D.Sc. at
London Uni. for a thesis on Attention
which is still in use in Germany and
England. It brought him the principal-
ship of Croydon P.L.C., where he wrote
“The Golden Key.”
Frank Russell, who has died of pneu-
monia in London at 48, first got into the
public eye when he won a De Garis
novel competition with “The Ashes of
Achievement.” Beginning as a school-
master, Frank became a solicitor and
started the Melbourne firm of Russell
and Russell with his brother Leslie. He
then took to journalism, and was Mel-
bourne “Herald’s” star interviewer and
writer of specials for several years. One
of his best efforts was a lyric descrip-
tion of the Sydney Eucharistic Congress.
The “Herald” sent him to America and
Europe afterwards, and he interviewed
practically all the notabilities. A tall,
fair, genial customer with unlimited self-
confidence and a pleasant manner, he
found it easy to make contacts, and he
wrote almost as quickly as he spoke. He
lost his wife in Melbourne shortly before
his last trip abroad, and was never quite
the same afterwards.
It is on the cards that Ronald Colman
may visit Australia. His only living rela-
tives are here —a sister and his brother
Eric, the Sydney radio announcer. Mrs.
Colman, the mother, died at Manly five
years ago.
“R.R.”: Has any solicitor in the Em-
pire been practising for as long as De
Courcy Ireland, of Heidelberg (Vic.)?
He was admitted to the profession by
Stawell, C.J., in 1866, and he is now 90.
Ireland’s father (Richard Davies) was one
of the barristers who successfully de-
fended the Eureka Stockade men.
“McGilp” delves into the past: —
Allegations of plagiarism against Stephen
Bransgrove recall a stroke of financial genius
which was put across the Melbourne Babbitts of
the early ’nineties. J. B. Paterson was Premier.
A German who claimed to be an artist of wide
renown waited on a number of big business-
men and was commissioned to do a life-size
portrait of their hero for the National Gallery.
The impostor hired a student to paint the pic-
ture from a photograph. Other commissions
began to come the way of the alleged artist,
when a lawsuit intervened, the real painter
of the Paterson portrait was put in the box
and the entire ramp came out.
“Somnus”: The McConnells, of Cress-
brook (Q.), must be about the most cos-
mopolitan of Australia’s pioneer families.
They have interests everywhere. David,
the octogenarian son of the original Mc-
Connell, took his M.D. degree at Edin-
burgh, and is a Doctor of Philosophy
of Heidelberg. Until recently he spon-
sored a College of Agriculture in
Albania. He was a guest at the Kaiser’s
marriage, and Cressbrook is stocked with
deer which were presented to the estate
by Queen Victoria.
“D.”: Frank Clune, hon. secretary of
the Fellowship of Writers, who resigned
over the Kisch row, is one of those Aus-
tralians who don’t need the advice of
Jonathan Cape, the London publisher,
to “write frankly about themselves.”
Clune’s autobiography is Pepysian in its
scorn of reticence. A nephew of Arch-
bishop Clune, he seems to have given the
prelate some anxious moments before
sailing before the mast for the U.S.A.
His account of life as a trooper in an
American cavalry regiment (from which
he deserted) is one of the brightest things
of its kind that have been done.
The late Dr. T. P. Mclnerney, former
warden of Melb. University Senate and
one-time M.L.A., had a prodigious
memory. It' was said that if you gave
him a line from one of Shakspeare’s
plays he could recite the rest of the opus.
T.P. was devoted to a younger brother,
Colonel Tim, who died a year or two
back. When Tim led his battalion down
Collins-street, en route to the Boer War,
T.P. walked beside him with his umbrella
at the “carry.”
Philip Osborne-Gibbes is dead in
Sydney. Heir to the baronetcy of
Gibbes of Springhead, a title now held by
a Maorilander, and born at Whangarei,
Philip was the son of Sir Samuel
Osborne-Gibbes, and brother of another
holder of the title who was once Maori-
land Education Minister. In his youth
he went to the Gilberts, where he
acquired the name “Piripo,” the native
version of Philip, and a fund of
stories which would have done credit
to Louis Becke. When he was 52
war broke out. He came to Aus-
tralia to enlist, and thereafter owned
about the only grudge which he
ever nurtured against anybody in his
kindly life. The doctor said he was
too old. Latterly, he lived in Syd-
ney, and for a long time was the
centre of a gathering of Homers which
used to meet on Saturday mornings to
make sure that the early history of Funa-
futi and Fanning Island was not for-
gotten, and that the ability to sing
“Adeste Fideles” in the Gilbert tongue
was not lost to humanity.

"THE GOODYEAR
MARGIN OF SAFETY
Absent-mindedness and "safety-last" mentalities on the road
make it all the more important for careful drivers like yourself to
drive on "G-3's" to afford the greatest possible protection to all
parties.
The "G-3" has fast-gripping, uncompromising, positive Centre
Tread Traction by virtue of its greater number of close-nested,
sharp-edged, diamond shaped blocks in the centre of the
tread exactly where it meets the road and grips. Nothing less
can give you such safe, quick, non-skid stopping!
Amazing mileage and non-skid tread life are given by the "G-3"
. . . the natural outcome of the thicker, heavier tread (averaging
two pounds more rubber per tyre) and the extra elastic, resilient
carcass of Supertwist Cord. Your Goodyear Dealer will tell you why
the "G-3" gives 43% longer non-skid mileage.

The health charts of the subsidiaries —
W, D. and H. O. Wills, British Austra-
lian Tobacco, the States Tobacco Co.
and S. T. Leigh and Co. —are not ex-
hibited, Still, the organisation has earned
the reputation of being one of Aus-
tralia’s most prosperous industrial con-
cerns ; it is also one of the largest. With
a twinkle in its eye, the market therefore
backs the management, and places this
holding co.’s scrip among the front-
rankers on ’Change.
During the 13 years to the close of
accounts in 1927 a steady 12 p.c. div.
was sweetened with £628,591 of bonus
scrip. In the 1927 reconstruction, a
seven-for-five gift issue (the book value
of shares in other cos. was written up
£2,324,131 for the purpose) lifted paid
capital to £9,619,186 in 1,484,727 6£ p.c,
(previously 6 p.c.) prefs. and 8,134,459
ords. Thereupon the ord. div. dropped
to 10 p.c., but rose to 12 p.c. again in
1930; it fell to 6 p.c. two years later, the
public having curtailed its expenditure
on smokes, while competition sharpened,
and the spring in exchange, tariff and
income and other taxes swelled out-
goings. The operating cos. have con-
tinued to send along a trifle more than
the pref. div. and 6 p.c. to the ords.
called for, though their earnings can be
safely said to have improved.
As for the current term, there has been
a sharp rise in the price of leaf in the
U.S.A., and the pound sterling now buys
fewer dollars than it did a year ago.
Locally the co. has undertaken to buy
all bright leaf offering and to replace its
stocks of mahogany and dark leaf, pro-
vided the quality is right; growers are
asking for a reduction of excise and in-
crease in the duty.
The market, however, sees no cloud
in the co.’s sky, and prices the ords, at
41s. as against 375. 6d. a year ago. The
return at 41s. is 2.9 p.c, on a 6 p.c. div,
basis ; the investor who looks for a shade
under 4 p.c. on his money counts on an
8 p.c. distribution. This and the pref.
div, would call for £166,657 more than
last year’s net receipts. The prefs. at
325. 6d. return 4 p.c.

It is a speculative investment. Still, the
market, stimulated by events which affect
immediate prospects, has lengthened its
bid for the fully-paid pound shares from
30s. 6d. in June last, when the scrip was
first listed, to 535. just before the Ex-
changes closed for the end-year holidays.
At the higher figure the return is 3.7 p.c.
on a 10 p.c. div. basis, or 4,5 p.c. on a
12 p.c. distribution, which is expected to
be well within reach at next balance.
The book value of the net tangible cover
is 16s. sd. That leaves out of the reckon-
ing provision for taxation (£6188) and
for doubtful debts, etc. (£2827). Licenses
and goodwill, not treated as an asset
herein, figure at £20,722.
The co. was registered in Sydney in
1930 as Claude Neon Lights (N.S.W.),
Ltd.; the nameplate was altered to the
present title last year. Meanwhile,
branches or subsidiaries have been set
up in all States, the co.’s signs have be-
come very popular, and; of course, com-
petition is already in the field. Much,
however, is expected from the co.’s new
patent, “Zonarc,” said to possess many
advantages over the conventional Neon
tubing.
Earnings are derived mainly from
rentals for the signs. Last year £108,487
was added to the rental value of signs
constructed, raising the figure to
£323,989, of which £30,044 came from
Claude Neon Lights (S.A.), Ltd., and
from the Westralian business of Claude
Neon (Vic.), Ltd., both of which were
bought only a month before the books
closed. Unmatured rentals figure at
£318,574, leaving £5415 outstanding.
Over what period it is expected to gather
the £318,574 is not ascertainable from the
published figures. The year’s gross earn-
ings were £12,652 better at £34,093. In-
cluding £415 struck off preliminary exes.,
thus wiping them out of the sheet, the
net result benefited by £5975 of the
increase, reaching 11.6 p.c. on average
capital as against 7.1 p.c. for the previous
term, and a liberal 10 p.c. was distri-
buted.
Here is the position so far as balance-
sheet figures show it:

Including stocks, more or less liquids ex-
ceeded the overdraft (up £6422) and
trade creditors (down £6568) combined
by £6791 when the books closed. The
co. had ' then received £12,662 (more
than a third of last year’s gross earnings)
of rentals in advance. The growth in
paid capital was £26,340. The net
growth in the capital value (£88,138) of
Neon signs out on lease was £27,261.
The real value of this equipment is gov-
erned by the rent it turns in. Much de-
pends upon the amount of amortisation
allowed, the nature of the contracts,
and upon bad debts and the course of
competition.
Since the close of accounts a sub-
stantial increase in sales and profits has
been reported.

The earnings of this little concern
reflect the activity of business generally.
It specialises in the manufacture of all
kinds of commercial stationery and
trades throughout the Commonwealth.
For the dozen years to the close of
accounts in 1929, a steady 10 p.c. div.
was sweetened with a 2i p.c. bonus when
things were going extra well. In ’2B
£12,500 was transferred from reserves to
capital to pay 10s. on each of 25,000
new £1 shares. The Brisbane branch be-
came more of a hindrance than a help,
and, with the slump in sales generally,
the ’3O profit fell to less than one-third
of the ’29 figure. Shareholders were
passed by for the first time since the
public became interested in 1910.
With the upward trend in the retail
trade there has been a better demand
for the co.’s dockets and other requisites,
costs have been lowered, the Brisbane
business has been put on a more secure
footing, and the co.’s figures have con-
tinued to improve. Last term gross earn-
ings (£39,136) sprang £4643; exes.
(£29,825, including £943 sent to the
superannuation fund) were up £2405,
leaving the net result 9.3 p.c. on capital
as against 7.1, 6.7, 3.6, 3.1, 13.5, 15.1
and 17.3 p.c. back to 1927. The div. was
lifted another point, making it 7 p.c.

Excluding shares in other cos., the year’s

surplus (£57,555) was £4940. The share-
holding is in the Westralian subsidiary,
which has paid 6 p.c. for each of the
last three years.
Three years ago the pound shares
fetched 10s. in the market. They are
now priced at 335. 3d. or thereabouts.
The return at 335. 3d. is 4.2 p.c. on a

Overproduction of canned fruits, fol-
lowed by price-cutting locally and an un-
satisfactory volume of export sales,
affected the 1933 figures, and the last
term opened with prospects anything
but bright. But the outlook changed, and
the year finished with record sales for
the industry—l,4oo,ooo cases overseas
and 800,000 cases locally—thanks partly
to seasonal influences. This and a bit
better demand for the co.’s other canned
foods and condiments sent gross earnings
up £10,893:

Exes, and the allowance for depreciation,
etc., took £1502 of the increase. Includ-
ing an unexplained addition of £464 to
reserves, enough remained to show 9.7
p.c, on capital as against 7.5, 9.2, 6.9, 10,
16.3,10.3 and 20.6 p.c. back to 1927. The
policy has been to distribute profits as
they were earned, so a point was added
to the div., lifting it to 8 p.C., and making
the average over the last decade 11.1 p.c.
There is nothing to worry about in the
finances:

Forestry bondholders who are looking
for rich returns from the timber trade
won’t derive any inspiration from this
old-established co.’s figures over the last
eight years. The business, which has
always been well handled, is spread
throughout the Commonwealth and
Maoriland, and two-fifths of the £750,000
of capital is bonus scrip, handed out in
the reconstruction of 1919. But the
industry became so sick that shareholders
have averaged only 3.4 p.c. since the close
of accounts in 1929, and reserves have
had to be raided for no less than
£145,178 to pay the meagre distributions
and cover trading and other losses.
Things looked up a bit during the last
term, thanks to the revival in the building
trade, and gross earnings (£71,955) sprang
£14,933. After allowing for depreciation
(shown as written off in the table) and
unexplained reserve adjustments, the net
result benefited by £9613 of the increase,
reaching 2.7 p.c. on capital as against
1.3 p.c. and losses of £25,950 and £10,400
for the three preceding years. A point
was added to the div., making it 3 p.c.,
though the lay-by had to be tapped for
£1951 to do it. '
The contraction in turnover has left
the co. with more money than it can find
employment for in the business: —-

During the last term, stocks were reduced
by £22,304, while £6785 was added to
debtors’ balances and £49,013 to cash
and investments. How much of this last
item (£390,491, equal to 13 s. per share)
will ultimately be required for trading
purposes it is difficult to say at the
moment. Meanwhile, returns from these
investments provide a handy contribu-
tion to the pool. When the outlook in
the trade clears sufficiently, a part return
of capital is a likely possibility.
The market prices the fully-paid 255.
shares at 19s. as against 16s. 3d. a year
ago. The return at the higher figure is
3.9 p.c. on a 3 p.c. div. basis, and the
net tangible cover 30s. 9d. per share.

trades, this little co, put out 150,000 £1
shares called to 10s. at a cost of £15,149.
Then, tempted by marginal gains on the
use of borrowed funds, it went to its
bankers, and divs. averaged 7.7 p.c. for
the four years to the close of accounts
in 1930, but the business put on no fat.
With the change in conditions creditors
began to ask for their money ; this was
difficult to get in, as it always is in hard
times, and moratorium and interest-re-
duction legislation added to the difficul-
ties.
Much of what the board had previously
called profit turned out to be losses,
which raised the amount of capital un-
represented by tangibles to £31,371
( 4s. lOd. per share) at Sept. 30, 1932.
Of this £30,000 was rubbed out by strik-
ing 4s. per share off capital, and another
shilling (£7500) was returned in cash,
reducing paid capital to £37,500 in ss.
shares.
Last year a trifle more profit was
claimed, and the 3 p.c. div. (equal to U
p.c. on capital originally put up by
shareholders) was repeated. That was
after charging a loss of £730 on the sale
of motor vehicles (all but one has been
sold) direct to the reserve for doubtful
debts (£17,270), which is deducted from
the asset in the sheet. Much depends
upon whether this reserve proves to be
adequate ; it will be some years before
all the old accounts are liquidated:

Mineral output of N. S. Wales last
year has been valued at £9,900,000, a
million better than the 1933 figure. Coal
was the most important contributor, with
7.700.000 tons, worth £4,690,000, up
£383,000. Still, the industry remains
sick, and at the moment it seems doubt-
ful whether it will ever regain its old
vigor—oil, among other things, has im-
paired its chances. Nevertheless, extrac-
tion of oil from coal may yet prove to
be the way out, and the Government has
appointed a committee to investigate the
possibilities in this direction. The silver-
lead-zinc mines at the Barrier (four are
in operation) come next, both for em-
ployment and value of output. Here an
extra 55,000 tons of crudes, making
1.256.000 tons in all, worth £2,200,000,
was raised. Australia has a great deal to
thank its silver-lead industry for. The gold
yield was 34,2300 z., valued at £291,000.
The output of tin was 225 tons better
at 1360 tons, worth £312,000. The five
cement cos., with an aggregate plant
capacity of 790,000 tons, turned out
231.000 tons as against 177,000 tons in
1933. The increase was due to the outlay
on public works and revival in the build-
ing trade.
* * * *
On the Bendigo field the year closed
with 40 cos. mostly engaged in develop-
ment work and the erection of plant on
a dozen lines of reef. The only two
dividend-payers were the Hercules, which
distributed £21,000 as against £90,000
in the previous year, and Little 180,
whose consistent returns from the 593 ft.
level enabled it to meet all outgoings,
distribute £2500 in divs. and put over
£5OOO in the bank. The year’s aggregate
yield from the whole field (30,0910 z., up
12850 z.) failed to come up to early ex-
pectations, owing to the falling-off of the
grade of ore in the Hercules; the co.
got 54580 z. from 12,514 tons as against
12,7030 z. from 11,917 tons in 1933. The
most important development of the year
was the formation of Bendigo Mines,
Ltd., a prospecting concern with power-
ful local and overseas backing. It has
thrown off three subsidiaries, which have
lost no time in making a start to thor-
oughly test the Napoleon, Nell Gwynne
and Carshalton lines of reef. The Cen-
tral Blue, which adjoins the Little 180
on the south, expects to find payable stuff
in its western ground, and North Blue’s
10-head of stamps should begin to fall
in February, while South Virginia, on
Paddy’s Gully anticline, expects to soon
haul payable stone from the 370 ft. level.
On the Deborah line, Monument Hill
has erection of its 10-head mill well in
hand, and the main shaft is being deep-
ened to test the extent and value of the
reef disclosed by the drill. At Garden
Gully, stone from the 143 ft. level has
been profitable, and the mine is to be
prospected at depth. Within the next
few months seven or eight cos, are ex-
pected to enter upon regular production ;
others will follow later.

A. G. Russell, of Melbourne, recently
sold four mining properties in Vic. to
London interests. One afea of some
6000-odd acres, embracing about 27£
miles of the Langi Imgan deep leads,
near Ararat, has been taken by
Keith Williams and the Australian
Machinery and Investment Co., one
of the De Bernales group. F. A.
Rich figures that the ground contains
16.000. c.y. of wash, of which
2.900.000, situated in basins or gold
traps, are expected to average 235. Bd.
a yard with gold at its present price.
The estimated profit is 17s. a yard. An-
other group has taken the other proper-
ties, including Campbell’s reef, Moyston,
which is to be worked by a co. with an
issued capital of £62,500 in ss. shares.
The remaining two shows, one at Reedy’s
Creek and the other at Yackandandah,
are low-grade dyke formations, suitable
for large-scale mining by opencut
methods. If present plans mature, a
couple of cos. with a nominal capital of
half a million each will gouge the stuff
out.

Oil Search, Ltd., continues its hunt for
liquid fuel and natural gas in Australia
and New Guinea with its usual thor-
oughness. A subsidiary. Gas Drillers,
Ltd., is preparing to test-drill a closed
structure at Mulgoa, near Sydney, for
natural gas, which has been an impor-
tant factor in lowering industrial and
other costs in the U.S.A. Another sub-
sidiary, Drillers, Ltd., stabbed a closed
structure at Warooby Creek, near Roma
(Q.) for oil. The drill bottomed on granite
at 3794 feet. Five gas sands were recored,
and the presence of a commercial gas
well was indicated. Production tests have
been deferred pending arrival from
America on Jan. 1 of a “blow-out pre-
venter,” designed to withstand a pres-
sure of 25001 b. per square inch. Inci-
dentally, the co. has authority to pros-
pect over 40,000 sq. miles of country
in Queensland, and the work of geologis-
ing the area is in hand. In New Guinea
a special staff is making an intensive
examination of a likely oil-bearing area
south of the Torricelli Mountains. The
stuff has been met with in commercial
quantities just over the border in Dutch
territory. In Westralia the co, is mark-
ing time until it receives Mr. Raggatt’s
report. Work at Lakes Entrance (Vic.)
was disappointing, and has been dis-
continued.

netted £389,940, equal to 25.3 p.c. on its
£1,539,903 of paid capital, for the year
to June 30 last. Over the same period
standard copper averaged £33 Bs. 6d, a
ton in London. The figure is now around
£2B 4s. For the four months to the end
of October, the co. was producing blister
copper at an operating cost of £l9 17s.

Admirers of Rothsay (W.A.) are elated
about C. G. Gibson’s estimate of 120,000
tons of probable B|dwt. ore. This is
apart from anything indicated by a
further 2700 ft. of proved ore channel,
in which length “further large tonnages
will undoubtedly be developed.” The
Rothsay was worked in the early ’nine-
ties by an English co., which, after spend-
ing a lot' of cash on plant and little on
development, gave up owing to the asso-
ciation of copper with gold. The show
remained idle for many years, and then
B.H, Prop, did some diamond drilling.
Recently, the present co., one of the
Hamer group, took possession. Nothing
is said of how much money will be re-
quired to develop and equip the mine,
or what average extraction is expected.
* * ♦ ♦
For the year ended Oct. 31 last Norse-
man’s mill (W.A.) treated 21,226 tons for
10,6010 z. bullion, and the cyaniding
plant 13,488 tons for 74370 z. bullion.
The yield was 10,6660 z. fine gold, which
realised £90,341. Working exes, were
£36,374, and the net profit £46,639. The
estimated cost of mining and crushing
the stone was 265., and of cyaniding 65.,
a total of 325. per short ton. It is ex-
pected to lower the total figure by Bs.
when the new plant, which will cost
about £45,000, is in full swing. To meet
the outlay 24,375 new ss. shares have
been put out at a premium of 355. each
since the close of accounts. The mine
is opening up nicely at depth, and the
intention is to keep development well
ahead of mill requirements.

Jack Warrick has got out of Great
Boulder’s managerial box seat and Ernest
Williams has got in. Williams’s associa-
tion with Westralian goldmining com-
menced in the early Coolgardie days,
when he was local partner of Bewick,
Moreing and Co. With Hoover he was
largely instrumental in forming the Kal-
goorlie Chamber of Mines, and also took
a hand in organising the Coolgardie min-
ing exhibition. He left the West in the
late ’nineties, and inspected and reported
on mines in almost every part of the
world. Later he managed the Boulder
Perseverance. He took a prominent part
in the gold-bonus campaign, and led
that section of the committee which
visited Sydney. To-day Boulder’s posi-
tion is not so satisfactory as it might be ;
gold extraction from the new plant is
lower than was expected, costs are stated
to have risen, and some of the best parts
of the mine are said to be under a three
years’ tfibute agreement. Hopes are that
an amalgamation with the Lake View
may yet be brought about.
jfc
Chairman A. J. Agnew, who was in
good form at the Lake View meeting,
said that developments were more than
keeping pace with mill requirements, and
costs, reduced by Is. 9£d. per ton last
year, were expected to be reduced still
further during the current term. But
the award of the State Arbitration Court
had not been given when he spoke.
Nevertheless, the higher wages and
shorter working week ordered by the
Court may not be very noticeable in
the cost sheets of the big Westralian gold
producers, thanks to continued improve-
ments in mining and treatment methods.

Sticky Kanowna pug has added an-
other gold-seeker to its financially-injured

slipperiest places in the West to build
castles upon.

Star Explorations, which has mining
interests in Westralia and elsewhere,
closed its year to September 30 last with
a profit of £17,572 against £8042 for the
preceding 12 months. Capital was in-
creased from £47,373 to £lOO,OOO, and a
10 p.c. div. was paid. Investments figured
at £107,399, but their market value was
llj p.c. more than that.

Yellowdine, Westralia’s latest and best

and out of the State. London cos. hold-

wealth Mining and Finance, Anglo-Aus-
tralian Gold Development, Great Boulder
and Gold Fields Aust. Development.
Other interests, including Adelaide, have
option seekers on the spot.

Bundi Tin is transferring its No. 2
Cheneh dredge from Malaya to alluvial
ground near Greymouth (M.L.). An
outlay of £14,000 has been incurred, and
another £15,000 will be required to
put the machine at work. Cash resources
were some £7OOO short; so capital has
been increased to £127,500 by raising the
nominal value of the shares by ss. to 30s.
each. The new area comprises 471 acres
of auriferous dirt, of which 76.8 acres is
estimated to contain 2,955,908 c.y. of 4.5
grain stuff. The dredge is scheduled to
turn over 120,000 c.y. per month. The
co. sold its No. 1 dredge for £6416.

“Big-hearted Herbert”
A variant of “The Taming of the
Shrew,” with Guy Kibbee as the victim.
He is a bully. Aline MacMahon, as his
wife, puts up with his tantrums till he
ruins a dinner-party and insults her
daughter’s young man. Then she and
the daughter humiliate him to the earth
by getting themselves up as figures of his
humble past and supplying an appro-
priately humble meal to some people he
is anxious to impress. When he protests
she threatens to leave him, and he sud-
denly reforms. It makes his lesson, which
is the basis of the plot, irrelevant, and, of
course, such a man could never change ;
but it’s the acting that counts. Kibbee
couldn’t be bettered as the voluble
domestic pest, and Aline MacMahon is
so much the managing, secretly derisive
wife that she almost makes the fantastic
events believable. A Regent film.
Ben Fuller, impresario of opera.
“The Gay Divorcee”
There is a touch of originality in this
musicomedy ; the action begins in Paris,
and there isn’t a shot of the Eiffel Tower.
Otherwise it breaks no new ground. Alice
Brady is the oft-divctrced mother, and
Ginger Rogers is the daughter; Eddie
Horton is the English barrister who
advises on the daughter’s divorce, Fred
Astaire the importunate lover. Alice
Brady is bright and irresponsible, and
Horton neurotically sad; Ginger Rogers
overdresses and looks petulant; Fred
Astaire dances —in short, all repeat their
well-known acts. The settings and photo-
graphy are of a high standard, but the
merits are all forgotten when Ginger
Rogers croons. As a crooner she is
sillier and more abysmally lugubrious
than most. Also at the Regent.
“The Captain Hates the Sea”
A talkified version of an American
novel which managed to slip by our
censors. There’s a big cast, and life in
a liner is more or less convincingly repre-
sented. An attempt at suicide and an out-
break of fire are the principal incidents.
Alison Skipworth, John Gilbert, Victor
McLaglen and Walter Connolly supply
such humor as is going. Gilbert is sup-
posed to be perpetually soused, but for-
gets it most of the time. McLaglen is a
detective chasing a pair of crooks (Fred
Keating and Helen Vinson), Action is
complicated and difficult to follow—so
difficult that the compiler of the blurb-
sheets provides a synopsis of the plot or
plots that coincides in hardly any detail
with the story told on the screen. Act-
ing is good, and though caricatures
rather than portraits are in order in-
terest is fairly well sustained. At Sydney
Capitol.
“The Dude Rancher”
A horse opera allegedly based on a
text by Zane Grey, but the story has
appeared in print at least 10,000 times
under the names of as many authors.
The Americans never seem to tire of it.
Principal ingredients are mustangs,
mesas, mesquites and mavericks, seasoned
with Colts, coyotes and canyons. It
takes George O’Brien an hour and a
quarter to foil the cattle rustlers, win
the goil’s lurv and clear her father’s name
of a foul aspersion, a period during
which most Australian observers will
pray fervently that the mind of Zane
Grey, in Heaven’s great mercy, may
some day be visited by a new idea. Also
at the Capitol.
“One Night of Love”
At the Liberty. The story isn’t origi-
nal, but it’s more coherent than usual,
and the song numbers, instead of being
thrown in here and there to distract
attention from the crudities of the plot,
fit in and assist the action.
Tullio Carminati, grim, single-purposed
and domineering, is the Italian maestro
who discovers a young singer in a
cabaret; Svengali-like, makes her a
prima donna, and then falls in love
with her.
All Grace Moore’s songs are satisfying,
particularly “One Fine Day.” She has
a gloriously clear, rich voice.
“Now and Forever”
This Melbourne Capitol talkie gives
Shirley Temple a part in which she reveals
a firm grasp of tragedy—and she is said
to be only. five. She discovers not only
that her beloved father is a thief but
worse —he has broken his word of honor
to her. As the gradual revelation of
her parent’s misdoings come home she
depicts the appropriate emotions with
amazing cleverness. Gary Cooper plays
the gentleman crook naturally, and
Carole Lombard is his suffering wife
whom he loves but dooms to a life of
“catching trains and dodging cops.” The
only other character who counts is Sir
Guy Standing, efficient as usual.
“Wagon Wheels”
Here we have virtuous settlers fighting
off bands of hostile Indians; profit-
hungry whites inciting redskins to mur-
der. Old stuff, but well produced and
acted. Randolph Scott is the hero, Gail
Patrick the heroine.
“Are You a Mason?”
All but the very young know the story
of the man who posed as a Mason for
20-odd years in order to escape from his
masterful wife for one night a week and
of his father-in-law, the bogus Worship-
ful Master. Bertha Belmore is great as
the mother-in-law. Humorless and digni-
fied and hard as nails, she goes through
life domineering over everybody and
doing it convincingly. Sonnie Hale is
the husband, Robertson Hare the father-
in-law and Gwynneth Lloyd the young
wife.
“The Four Masked Men”
A British bloodcurdler built on Ameri-
can lines and rather more convincing
than most of its kind. Judy Kelly, for-
merly of Sydney, is leading lady. Both
at Melbourne Athenaeum.
“For Love of You”
Main ingredients of this Mayfair film
are comedy by Arthur Riscoe and Naun-
ton Wayne and Franco Foresta’s luscious
voice. Foresta portrays an operatic
singer intensely jealous of his innocent
wife. To cure him the wife (Diana
Napier) encourages Riscoe. Riscoe, to
save the underpants in which he cavorts
periodically from being riddled by
Foresta’s bullets, reunites the couple, and
the thing ends with Foresta repeating the
jazz theme song. Foresta can’t act, and
the photography is poor.
“Up to the Neck”
Ralph Lynn falls in love first with
theatrical life, then with Winifred
Shotter, who is miscast as a ballet girl.
To give her a chance to star he backs a
show. The leading man walks out, Lynn
takes the role, and, of course, turns the
second-rate melodrama into a successful
farce. Lynn works hard, but his asinini-
ties become monotonous, in default of
the contrast which Tom Walls’s acidu-
lous sophistication used to supply. Also
at the Mayfair.
“Speed Wings”
Tim McCoy, instead of being a strong,
silent, two-gun man, is here a strong,
silent and nerveless pilot. There’s an-
other pilot who is also strong and silent,
but far from nerveless, and a girl who
loves him. Of course, she and Tim
bring about the restoration of the other’s
nerve, so that he wins the big race. The
race is exciting.
“Adventure Girl”
Joan Lowell took her father for a trip
on a schooner to celebrate his 76th birth-
day. The crew consisted of two sailors
and a dog, and they had some exciting
experiences with descendants of the South
American Conquistadores. Back in U.S.A.
Joan wrote a book, and then went
through the whole thing again for the
films. She tells the story with the help
of the camera, and tells it well. Both at
the Civic.
Some First Nights
The title of “Viktoria and Her Hussar”
evokes expectation of a Victorian sub-
title such as “or the Genteel Adventures
of Two Men and a Maid,” but apart
from the title there is no hint of any-
thing but modernity in this bright musi-
cal show at Sydney Royal. It has a
League of Nations atmosphere ; the pro-
logue and three acts take place in Siberia,
Japan, Petrograd and Hungary respec-
tively, and give the producer opportuni-
ties for variety in colorful costumes and
settings which have been exploited to the
limit. A definite Hungarian flavor per-
vades the music, from the luscious
waltz tunes to the quick - pulsing
czardas, except in Act I, where the
rhythm and range contract to pseudo-
Japanese and get away with it with as
little adverse comment as Puccini got for
a similar crime. Taking it all through
the music is of a higher standard than
Tullio Carminati in “One Night of
Love,” at Sydney Liberty.
we have come to expect from the aver-
age musicomedy. “Petals of the Plum,”
“Land of Song,” and “Good Night” are
numbers that we may expect to find on
all radio and butcher-boys’ repertoires
at an early date, while “Star of My
Night” is one of the finest duets dis-
closed by musicomedy for a long time.
Sylvia Welling is Viktoria without
ever being Vicki. As the wife of the
ambassador, and later in her native vil-
lage, she invests the part with a cool,
calm dignity that never cracks. Sidney
Burchall as the ambassador gains the
sympathy of the audience, and many
would have preferred to see him rather
than the errant lover in the arms of
Viktoria at the curtain. John .Mayer,
making his, first appearance in Australia,
brings good looks and a tuneful voice
to the part of the Hussar. The comedy
side of the play is its weakest point.
Cecil Kellaway does his best with
the material at hand, aided and abetted
by the dancing of Sylvia Kellaway. But
honors go to Nellie Barnes, who makes
Riquette a vivacious creature whose
Grace Moore in “One Night of Love”
twinkling feet and tongue liven up the
show.
Settings are colorful and spectacular,
the close of the Japanese wedding scene
with its weaving lanterns on the dark-
ened stage being an exquisite bit of
work. The ballet is excellent, especially
in the Russian dances in Act 11, and there
is a distinct influence of Mae West in
the proportions of the chorus—the
female side, anyhow.
* * *
The very favorable impression made
on Sydney by the Fuller co.’s presenta-
tion of “Ai'da” was confirmed by its per-
formance of “Tannhauser,” which, with
“Die Fledermaus” and repetitions of the
Verdi spectacle, has been occupying the
boards at the New Tiv. during the last
week and a half, Ben Williams made
his debut as Tannhauser—a fine, manly
tenor who wears mediaeval German garb
with a style. Baritone Sydney de Vries
was Wolfram, and put a well-modulated
voice through its paces in “Star of Eve.”
Thea Philips was a charming Elizabeth,
vocally and otherwise, and Dawn Light-
foot, as the goddess, made the Venus-
berg scenes passably feasible. De Abra-
venal’s control of the orchestra was mas-
terly, but the massiveness of the “Tann-
hauser” music always seems to need not
one orchestra but six, with a brass band
thrown in. Staging was gorgeous.
The Strauss operetta “Die Fledermaus”
is a trifle of the genre of Rossini’s
“Barber.” It brought forward Austra-
lian tenor Browning Mummery and Bel-
gian tenor Octave Dua, but with the
burden of vocal display falling on Ben
Williams and Thea Philips. The light-
some character of the little play was a
welcome relief after heavy Verdi and
heavier Wagner, but the verdict of pos-
terity, which has buried all of “Die
Fledermaus” save its prettiest waltz, was
not seriously disturbed by the resurrec-
tion. It was found necessary to strengthen
the piece by inserting a ballet to the
strains of “The Blue Danube.”

A cynical theatrical manager once gave
as the recipe for success in musical
comedy: “Dress ’em or undress ’em.”
“Roberta,” at His Majesty’s, Melbourne,
achieves a popular success by doing both.
Musical and histrionic perfection could
not have produced in an audience more
hysterical enthusiasm than that which pre-
vailed on the opening night. The plot is

The Husband Pays
The divorce law may be the same for
rich as for poor in N. S. Wales (B.
12 /12 / ’34) ;in Queensland it is not. A
Queensland husband seeking a divorce
is not only responsible for the respon-
dent’s costs should she elect to defend
the suit; he is obliged to deposit suffi-
cient with the Court or give ac-
ceptable security before he can go on
with the case. Only a man with means
can do this. A guilty and spiteful wife
may for years prevent a husband of
modest means from obtaining freedom
to which he has a right on the facts. —

By Air Mail
We take the unique opportunity
afforded by the inauguration of the Eng-
land-Australia air mail to pass a message
of goodwill to yourself and, through you,
to your readers. We trust that this new
and quicker method of inter-communica-
tion between our peoples will appreciably
extend both the commerce of our re-
spective countries and the goodwill
existing between ourselves and the great
Australian press. — Ronald B. Browne,
for T. B. Browne (Eng.).
“Not the World’s Worst”
Just after we heard news of the
record-breaking times of the centenary
air-race fliers we received several com-
plaints from the U.K. and Europe that
our air-mail letters posted’ from here
were being received a week to 10 days
later than sea-mail copies posted at the
same time. Although Siam is a member
of the International Postal Union,
Siamese officialdom decrees that all air-
mail correspondence must leave the
country via Bangkok aerodrome, not-
withstanding that letters may be endorsed
“via Penang”—by that route they would
reach their destination a fortnight earlier.
To time of writing it looks as though no
change will be made when the Australian
link of Imperial Airways is connected.
In effect, it means that, although faci-
lities are available, our letters to Aus-
tralia will take longer by air mail than
by the present sea route.
Our complaints so far have been re-
ceived with a bland smile and a state-
ment that “regulations must be carried
out.” Being “foreigners” we cannot be
too persistent, lest we be subject to a
type of pin-prick victimisation that only
the Orient knows. In this country it is
a major offence to criticise the Govern-
ment.
Australian politicians, statesmen (if
any) and civil servants are definitely not
the world’s worst. — Pembohong (West

These Taxgatherers
The woes of “Y. Kik” (B. 5/12/’34)
are as nothing to mine. I lost my last
permanent job in 1929 ; it left me owing
21s. income tax, or so it was alleged.
Notices about this guinea followed me
about the track for two years and a half ;
then they lapsed. I thought the tax-
gatherers had forgotten me, but recently
they started again—traced me by my
footprints or something. At first they
threatened; then they cajoled: the
amount was jumped up a bit, but would
be reduced if I paid before a certain date.
I replied that I had nothing to pay with ;
told them I had no job and no income.
No good. They are now demanding a
statement of my assets and liabilities. —
Ferocious O’Flaherty (N.S.W.).
The Master-class
Coke said long ago: “It is one of the
genuine proofs of servitude to have the
law either concealed or precarious.” Had
he lived to-day he could not have hit
off more neatly the relation of Austra-
lian taxpayers to the Commonwealth
Income Tax Department. The law is
concealed from them in a complicated
mathematical formula governing the rate
of tax which not one taxpayer in a thou-
sand can understand ; it is made pre-
carious by a host of regulations,
“amended” from time to time. To this
full measure of precariousness are added
Star Chamber powers of decision and
penalty.
The Australian is apt to regard Eng-
land as a country bound hand and foot
by law and custom. Taxgatherers in
England sock the citizen heavily, but they
do it without introducing a truculent
threat of heavy fines in every letter which
an anonymous clerk signs with a rubber
stamp of the Taxation Commissioner’s
signature. In England, too, it is prac-
ticable for any taxpayer to estimate for
himself the precise amount of his tax for
the year. In Australia it is admitted by
taxgatherers themselves that very few of
their victims possess the mathematical
and legal knowledge required for this
under the Income Tax Act, the regula-
tions thereunder, the decisions and the
rulings. Shrewd businessmen tell you
the only way is to put in an impeccable
return, to pay without question whatever
the department demands, and to thank
God for a happy deliverance. Does the
tax-paying Australian citizen need any
further proof of his serfdom to clerks?
—E. S. J. (Q ).
Substitutes for Wool
When German Consul-General Asmis
told the N.S.W. Graziers’ Council of the
possibilities of wolstra there was a rush
to Canberra to implore the Government
to negotiate with Germany.
A critical examination of wolstra
materials shows that their disadvantages
are serious. They do not possess elas-
ticity, and the admixture of vistra fibre
destroys that property in the wool
content. Damp has a deleterious
effect on the fabrics, and an English
expert states that in England materials
like wolstra would only be employed in
very low clothing trades.
On the strength of these reports the
Graziers have executed a volte-face,
and we are being assured wolstra is not
such a big bad wolf after all. These
comments are as stupid as they are tact-
less. If Hitler ukases that the Fatherland
must restrict its wool imports, notwith-
standing its inferiority in all the proper-
ties which have made wool an ideal raw
material for clothing wolstra must be
used.
Every kind of substitute is steadily re-
ducing the consumption and demand for
wool. In recent years production of
mungo and shoddy in the Colne Valley
of Yorkshire has reached unprecedented
figures, and many excellent materials are
being manufactured from wool wastes
and rags. I have seen in London pre-
sentable materials from shoddy and
mungo being retailed at Is. 6d. a yard.
We cannot afford to miss the least
opportunity of keeping wool to the fore
and the chance of pushing trade. We
are right up against every other kind of
textile, and we will have to fight tooth
and nail to keep our end up.— Valerin
(N.S.W.).


ABORIGINALITIES
“Cigale”: The best grasshopper yarn
to date comes from Victoria. At Wed-
derburn railway station they attacked the
bagged wheat waiting for the rail and,
according to eyewitnesses, “sat up on
their hind legs, like kangaroos, to eat it.”
Still, there is room for thankfulness. To
date no grasshopper has developed suffi-
ciently to take a bag of wheat under
each arm—or is it leg?-—and fly off
with it, nor have any, apparently, imitated
the kangaroo to the extent of evolving a
pouch to carry rations for the next hop.
“Y.Z.”; Millions of white butterflies
appeared in Sydney the other day. The
grasshopper plague out west was pre-
ceded by millions of white butterflies.
One daren’t prophesy about these things,
but
* * * *
“Old-timer”: The spirit of the out-
back has withered and curled up. In a
Sydney paper there recently appeared a
picture of a man walking beside sheep on
a thirsty day; the caption was “The
Thirsty Drover,” and he was drinking
ginger pop. God save the Riverina!
* * * *
“Rindy”; My canary shows more
ferocity to the feather than an Alsatian
shows in the whole of his make-up. I’ve
fed—and tried to pet—the little fowl for
years. Yet every time we go near his
cage he becomes a raging tornado —
screaming and snapping and trying to
get at us through the bars of his cage.
Strangely, he’s friendly with the cat, but
any time is a good time with him for a
dust-up with us. Why?
“Tripod”: Godfrey Bros., borers, of
Cunnamulla (Q.), have confounded pes-
simists who predict the imminent failure
of Australia’s subterranean water supply.
Drilling the other day on Glendilla sta-
tion, they brought in a flow which com-
menced at the rate of 1,000,000 gallons
a day, and after a little more drilling in-
creased to 1,500,000 gallons. It is the
largest flow established in that corner of
Queensland for many years.

“R.H.T.”: A trip up the Hokianga
River in the far north of Maoriland is
an eye-opener as to the many and varied
uses a pontoon can be put to. Loads
of cattle, sheep and pigs are common.
I saw a circus which travels the north
being loaded on to one at Rawene, and
the performance which was enjoyed free
of charge by the locals was far and away
ahead of anything they staged at night
By watching the tides tremendous loads
of farm produce can be floated up or
down without much effort, and every
farmer owns a pontoon or two.
“Jindivick”: The recent Gippsland
inundation drove more than people from
their homes. I waded through the waters
to a submerged bridge over the Tarago
River, and there on the top rail, just
above water level, I saw a sight to
gladden the heart of any collector of
bugs and beetles. Bull-ants, buckjumpers,
caterpillars, lizards, ladybirds and hun-
dreds of other kinds of crawling and
flying insects were clambering over each
other out of reach of the swirling flood.
In the water itself large snakes gave pass-
able impersonations of Webb swimming
Niagara.

“Eureka”; Camped in an old slab hut
one night, I listened to the tap, tap, tap
of a couple of death-watch beetles. One
could quite imagine timid people being
made uneasy. I came to the conclusion
that these beetles had a system of Morse
code long before human beings thought
it out. At pretending to be dead the
bugs are pastmasters. The old chap
camped with me reckoned they were a
sure sign of a death in the hut, so he
packed up next morning and left. Later
in the day a bushfire forced me to clear
out, too.

‘Rahoy”: 1 overtook the drover a
couple of miles from Gilgandra (N.S.W.)
just as he was about to tie a stone round
his neck and dive in the nearest dam.
Most ' of his mob had pink-eye, a few
were pea-eaters, and his dogs were too
sore-footed to walk, let alone work. I
lent a hand, and somehow or other we
harried them into Gil. in time to reach
CHOOM: “Excuse me, sir—you’ve overslept. It’s three o'clock!”
the nearest before it closed. As we
parted a little later, he said earnestly,
“Well, son, there’s one thing you can
bet yer shirt on. If you ever come down
that road again and you see a bloke with
pink-eyed sheep and sore-footed dogs, no
matter if he is the dead spit of me, he
won't be me!”

“Louden”; Tell Edward Harrington,
who is troubled by “cats on the roof”
(B. 12/12/’34), to save all his burnt-out
electric-light globes:
They make inexpensive and excellent bombs
To hurl at the tabs and the turbulent toms.
* * * *
“Yangardook”; I was one of a party
running a 22-mile water-channel 80 miles
west of Broken Hill when a night’s tor-
rential downpour transformed the
parched plains into a veritable sea. We
were worrying about our horses and
camp when a couple of fencers, their
gear stacked on a four-wheeled contrap-
tion drawn by a couple of mules, dis-
regarded our warning and attempted to
cross our channel. The outfit was soon
hopelessly bogged. The driver jumped
out and began to use a waddy on the
ribs of the near-side mule ; the brute sud-
denly grabbed him below the knee,
throwing him on his back in the mud and
grinding the limb for all it was worth.
The mule was knocked insensible with
a stirrup-iron before it released its grip.
The man later lost the leg.
* * * *
“Scaly”; If all the ophiologists have
finished arguing about snakes and legs,
about young ’uns having ’em and drop-
ping off as they grow older and get
more sense, let me tell them all that
there is a snake with things which look
like legs. That is the gidya snake of
W.Q. Perhaps, like the black cockatoo,
it lives on gidya grubs. I’ve got them
up to about 3ft. long—which the blacks
assured me was full-grown and mature.
At about the point where its hips should
be it has a pair of fins which might be
termed atrophied legs. The fins would
be claw-shape, with the semblance of a
knee just above them, and they would,
say, be about the size of a man’s little
fingernail. Now, the easiest way to get
that wriggler: Watch an old-man
goanna digging at the foot of a gidya-
tree, and when he has unearthed the
snake take a hand and rob him of his
spoils.
* * sfc
“Emel”: J. McNamara, of Miga Lake
(Vic.), attached a fishhook to a
length of stout twine, baited it with a
dead mouse and hung it in his barn near
the spot where he’d seen a snake dis-
appear. Next morning the wriggler was
securely hooked. The catch measured
4ft. 6in.
* * * *
“Titun”: Residents of Phillip Island
(Vic.) are bemoaning the mortality among
mutton-birds. The flights coming in from
the ocean feeding-grounds in myriads at
dusk are a constant attraction for tourists.
Now the fowls are dying of starvation,
due to the unaccountable scarcity of the
minute crustaceans on which they feed.
The birds are rigorously protected; a
party caught taking eggs and young birds
last year was fined £5O a head.
* * * *
“Yabbie”: Maoriland, which has suc-
cessfully acclimatised the Pacific salmon
after vainly experimenting with his
Atlantic brother, has for 70 years been
trying to get the “European” lobster to
settle down in Shivery Island waters. The
first shipment of 25 left England in 1864.
They fought and ate each other until
only one was left. In despair the experi-
menter sold this crustacean Gabbett to
one of the passengers on the ship. Since
then millions of young lobsters have been
hatched in M.L. and turned loose in
suitable waters, but devil a one of them
has ever been caught in the matured
stage. The experience of the salmon-
introducers might be copied by the lob-
ster enthusiasts, and the stud stock
brought from American waters. The
lobster is an important figure in the
U.S.A. fishing statistics, and presumably
he is as plentiful on the Pacific side as
he is on the Atlantic littoral.

“Eureka”; “The married bull has
broken into the lucerne paddock,” the
new hand gasped as he reached the kit-
chen. “What do you mean by ‘married’
bull?” dad asked. “The one with the
ring on its nose,” the new hand replied.
* * * *
“Jumpin Pin”: “Bray Rock” had his
leg pulled, I fancy, by the old-timers who
told of the lashin’s of free grog which
lined the shores of Moreton Bay after
the flood of ’93 had swept Brisbane to
the bone (B. 12/12 / ’34). I was in Brisbane
when the not-so-big washout of ’96 came
along. Here again much good liquor in
casks and bottles was swept off the
wharves and out of the waterside ware-
houses. In those days I spent most of
my week-ends cruising the bay in a 22-
footer. Bottled stuff we never saw, its
weight having naturally sent it to the
bottom of the river. Barrels of beer,
stout and whisky were plentiful enough
about Amity Point and the South Pas-
sage, but they were Dead Sea fruit, in
a manner of speaking. Though appar-
ently impervious, the casks had failed to
keep out the salt water, which, in the
many instances when we sampled their
contents, had made the liquor undrink-
able. Many a stout old mullet-seiner and
oyster-dredger of Cleveland and Wyn-
num has told me of similar nightmare
experiences with tears in his eyes.
* * * *
“Tripod”: “Top-rail” (B. 14/11/’34)
credits the camel with spreading the
poly-bush. “Roly-poly” is quite capable
of perpetuating itself. As the plant
withers its roots draw up out of the
ground and off rolls the bushy ball, the
plaything of every breeze. It’s no un-
common sight on the plains of western
Queensland and N.S.W. to see hundreds
of these plants bowling along, for all the
world like a scattered mob of sheep ; but
should “roly-poly” come to a halt in a
suitable spot it lets down its roots and
becomes a growing plant again.
* * * *
“Verneuker”: That Shanghai journal-
ist who pinched Bulletin pars, to fill his
allotted space (B. 19/12/’34) has plenty
of mates. In a Sydney bar I listened to a
fellow recounting as his own experience a
South African lion story I had written
myself for The Bulletin some months
earlier. I was hailed and asked to join
the group. The raconteur was invited to
tell his adventure again for my benefit.
Fortunately for me the introducer men-
tioned that I wrote for The Bulletin ;
the story-teller forthwith remembered he
had an urgent engagement elsewhere.
* * * *
“Pile Light”: From Brisbane comes a
tale of a boat’s crew towed by a “shark”
which had seized the
anchor and made off
with the craft until the
crew had to cut the rope.
The “shark” was not
seen. It was probably a
horned ray. These
beasts have two claspers
on each side of the
mouth, and anchor ropes
seem to have a peculiar
attraction for them.
Once they fasten on
they are too stupid to let
go, and rush off in a
panic, taking the boat
with them. In North
Queensland waters they
are common, and divers
have learned to dread
their attempts to investi-
gate their airpipes and
lines. They seem to do
this out of curiosity in the
first place; there have
been several tragedies
from broken airpipes
owing to this queer habit.
* * *
“R.H.T.”: The rumpus in Maoriland
over the administration of the “Ngata
scheme” of native settlement reminds me
of investigations I made into its opera-
tions on native village life in 1933. The
scheme aimed at breaking up the com-
munal spirit and substituting individual
ownership. In the past the Maori who
grew a crop on land to which he had
only a vague title had to share the result
with all and sundry. One old native put
it this way: “If I grow te corn or te
kumera all te Maori come and help tern-
selves. Now te land is mine, and I borrow
te money and fence it, and milk te cows,
and send te cream to te factory. No
Maori going to dip into my cream-can.”
1 suggested that when the cream cheque
was confiscated to pay the interest indi-
vidual hardship would quickly follow in-
dividual ownership. The old Maori’s
reply was: “The pakeha all go pung ;
why not te Maori, too?”
* * * $
“Lachesis”: The recent floods in Vic-
toria have revealed that the State boasts
a remarkable snake crop. Seymour, on
flat country about 100 miles from Mel-
bourne, has been enjoying a visitation
from assorted relatives of Eve’s old pal.
Brown, black, tiger snakes and copper-
heads swarmed into the town ; over 500
were killed in a few days. Outside
Seymour conditions were just as bad,
stations and farms reporting plenty
of sport for those who like that
kind of thing. Something of the same
sort afflicted Brisbane in the calamitous
’93 flood. Thousands of crawlers came
down from up country on the floating
timber and the numerous wooden houses
washed down. When all these piled up
against Victoria bridge in a vast bank the
serpents climbed on the bridge and, this
having been closed to other traffic, in-
vaded North and South Brisbane in
force. Many a Queen-street bushman
who had never seen a real snake in his
life dates his membership of the Recha-
bites from about that time.
A POSSIBLE CAUSE.
“Me married? ’Struth, not me,” said Jim, as
5 on the fire a log he tossed;
“I’ve nearly reached the Psalmist’s span, an’

Not that I’ve got so much against what’s

a man with floods o’ words.
“I nearly got tied up, though, once. It must
be forty year ago.
I saw an advert, mentioning a lonely widder
with some dough
(At least she said she had!) desired to corre-
spond with country gent.,
View mat.; an’ as I didn’t ’ave much cash,
well, in me answer went.
“She wrote back straight away, as if she meant
to get right down to biz,
And kept on writin’ even when I sent a likeness
of me phiz.
That postal courtship went apace; it looked as
if I’d land a bride,
While that man-chasin’ widder must ha’
thought that she was ’ome an’ dried.
“At last she writes an’ asks me straight if I
could manage to git down
To Sydney for to fix it up—the weddin’, if
you please—in town.
Me goats had got some sickly young; to quit
’em might have cost me quids;
An’ so I wired that it was quite ‘impossible
to leave the kids.’
‘1 never ’card from ’cr again; I s’pose she
musta changed ’er mind;
Most women are like that y’ know,” old
Jim, the woman-wise, opined.
“I sometimes wonder, though, if she mis-
understood that wire I sent!
I didn’t make it plain enough; per’aps, that
they was goats I meant!”

“Gam”: Touching on emus and wire
fences (B. 31/10/’34), two girls on then-
way home from school near Millicent
(S.A.) came upon a bird that had failed
to clear the fence, and was lying on
the ground with one leg firmly held be-
tween the twisted wires. A piece of wood
enabled them to loosen the wires, and
the fowl freed itself. While it was
struggling to rise one youngster threw
her leg over its back. The result was
not quite what she expected ; the bird
sprang to its feet and bounded off with
her clinging to its feathers. After about
100 yards of going the mount floundered
in the sand and rolled over with its rider.
She was merely shaken and scared.
* * * *
“Emel”; Perhaps that light pine on the
Bogan (B. 28 /11 / ’34) is the species we
in n.-w. Vic. call Murray pine. It bears
small round cones, often clustered closely
on the branches, and its young, bright-
green tips droop gracefully, though the
trees are erect in habit. Given a chance,
they will grow to two or three feet in
diameter. Because the timber is im-
mune from white-ants, all our floors
here are of the pine, locally grown and
sawn.

“Towri”: Those abo. commercial
travellers in pituri owed their immunity
when passing through strange country
(B. 19 /12 /’34) to the credentials they
carried —the “message sticks,” so called,
dozens of which I have seen in
amateur collections in my youth on the
Barcoo. These sticks of dark-brown
wood were about four inches long, oval
in section and about quarter of an inch
thick. On each side they were carved
“What a peculiar child!”
“Yeah —bit of a scream, ain’t ’e?”
with wavy lines and zigzags, which never
seemed to be the same on two sticks.
The oldsters called them “blackfellows’
letters.” It was Dr. Roth, then of Boulia
in the pituri country and later Protector
of Abos. in Queensland, who first pub-
lished the real meaning of these message
sticks, which had anthropologists guess-
ing for years previously.

“Kieta”: The New Guinea native
policeman on duty usually struts as if
he owned the universe—Administration
and all. I’ve seen him parading about
with a bandolier full of revolver cart-
ridges but no revolver. At one port it
is the delight of the local sergeant to
have his men out on the parade ground
on boat day equipped with rifles, and,
while he stands under the shade of a
tree, he puts the poor beggars through
solid drill, without a break, until they
almost drop. All the while he is angling
for favorable comment from tourists.

“Kieta”: The Buka tribe on Bougain-
ville Island (Mandated Territory) has a
queer marriage custom. When a boy gets
hitched a conical-shaped reed basket is
put on his head, and his hair grows into
it. The idea is that his Mary must not
see his thatch during the first two years
of married bliss. They present a queer
sight with these contraptions on their
brain-boxes.

“Bogaduck”: Next to the frog I’ll back
our Murray cod for the biggest mouth in
proportion to size. A post-mortem on
a strangely-fat cod caught in a net dis-
closed a full-grown rabbit which was
nearly as long as the cod. From a
smaller cod we took a big freshwater
lobster, with the spines all pointing to-
wards the head. It had been swallowed
head first, too.
“Larrapinta”: Can’t make out why
more attempts aren’t made to introduce
Murray cod to other lakes and rivers. It
can be done ; a squatter put 20 baby cod
into a lagoon 10 years ago, and just
recently took a fine 12-pounder in a
drum-net, while any number of two- and
three-pound beauties have been caught
on lines during the past few years. The
original fish stood a 200-mile journey
from the Murray in a cream-can of
water, so the job seems easy enough.

“Prickly”: “Lugger’s Mate” might be
right about the gastric troubles due to
follow a meal off a seahorse (B.
28 /11 / ’34). I think, though, the toad
is the daddy of ’em all for giving indiges-
tion. He’s that same fellow, slimy and
repulsive, who inflates himself and gasps
huskily when tickled under the chin or
rolled on the sand, and goes off with a
mighty “bang” when a rock is dropped
on him in that condition. I have known
one small toad —as long as a man’s middle
finger—stretch out a whole fowlyard of
chooks when, by mistake, it was boiled
up with a kerosene-tinful of food. A
friend scoffed at the idea. His fowls,
too, took a short cut to the feathered
heaven where all good little fowls go,
and where there is a constant crowing
and scratching for worms.

“Procurator Fiscal”: A cousin of the
M.L. cow who swamped the cider mash
left out to cool (B. 19/12/’34) provided
Scottish law with a leading case. A
brew-wife set her tub of mash for ale
outside her door. A neighbor’s cow
came along and sank the lot. The inn-
keeper sued the owner for damages. He
pleaded that the swallowed mash was in
the nature of a deoch an’ dhoris, which,
as Scottish law laid down, could be de-
manded free by any departing traveller.
The case turned on whether the drinker
was standing at the door when the
draught was taken, the law requiring
that. It was proved that the cow made
no attempt to sit down or even lean
against the doorpost; the verdict went in
the favor of her owner.

“Naomi Ned”; Any of those Aboliar
art critics notice the failure of our emi-
nent Norman Lindsay to present a
goanna correctly in his cartoon (B.
28 /11 / ’34)? The reptile has the appear-
ance of an elongated frog, plus a tail,
The head, neck and mouth are decidedly
f ~oglike.
“I tol' yer there was a dud charge about here somewhere.”
“Eureka”: Kookaburras are the most
friendly birds in the bush if left alone.
Have been daily watching a family
in the Bega (N.S.W.) district do
the milking while two old kookas (not
tamed birds) sit on the cows’ backs in
the bails. On the same farm a couple
roost at night in the fowlhouse with the
Leghorns. At daybreak they leave for
the bush, but return regularly at dark.

“Ex-C.G.”; New Year’s Day
always reminds me of the race
meeting we held at Mallee Root.
Horses and crowd arrived early,
the course was pegged out, and
Dan Bung erected a hessian-
and-bough booth. The day was
a scorcher, and by noon all
Bung’s supplies had been used.
Bill Greenhide was on the way
from the railway with a bullock-
waggon load of refills, so the
mob went out to the course. As
they prepared for the first race,
anxious eyes watched the road
to the east. Soon a cloud of
dust came in sight, and from it
emerged a solitary and stricken
horseman. It was Greenhide.
“Broke me king pin near Pretty
Pine,” he croaked, “and she’s
well stuck in the sand.” Pretty
Pine was 18 miles away, and an
awful feeling swept over the
crowd. Suddenly Bung called
for helpers and began to load
the portable parts of his booth
on borrowed vehicles. “If we
can’t have the beer at the races,”
he said, “we’ll have the races at
the beer!” Inside five minutes
the road to Pretty Pine was
hidden under the dust of a
hurrying cavalcade, and an-
other notch was cut in the long record of
Australian initiative.
* * * *
“Splodger”: I’m with “G.G.6” all the
way about the staghounds (B. 7/11/ ’34);
the Alsatian is to me an unknown quan-
tity. Early in ’95 they had a pack of
those Scotch dingo-killers at Northamp-
ton Downs, Blackall (C.Q.). Did they
cross with the dingo and do all the fear-
ful things which ass-headed people pre-
dicted? No chance! They’d do their
work when they were on the job. Left
alone, and away from man’s care, they
just couldn’t stand the strain. When the
Willsallens owned Tooleybuc, in the
Boulia district, they turned staghounds
loose to inter-breed with the dingoes so
as to give them, the dingoes, enough size
to keep the ’roos in check. How was
that lot condemned! If there had been
a local press “Father of Ten” and “Pro
Bono Publico” would have taken
columns. As there wasn’t a local news-
paper the “Mulga Wire” and the ‘‘Bag-
man’s Gazette” gave the move full pub-
licity and condemnation. I’ve trapped a
few dogs in that district since, and, as a
receiver, I’ve given certificates for many
scalps. In each and every case they were
just dog and with not one trace of stag
ancestry.
* * * *
“Titoki”: “Y.O.Y.’s” red-gum (B.
28/11/34) is a tortoise. Here in the
Waikato (M.L.) district, E. botrydides
(bangalay) has grown from a seedling
to 15ft. 2in. in 18 months. A growth
of 10ft. in its first year is commonly re-
ported of the transplanted E. viminalis
(manna gum) in volcanic loam. I be-
lieve that I. H. Maiden records a growth
of 25ft. in 18 months for E. pilularis
(blackbutt) at Gosford (N.S.W.). Can
anyone beat that?
* * * *
“Nosyd”: My sympathy is with Bowral
(N.S.W.) landowners (B. 17/10/34). If
Batlow P. P. Board considers wombats
“only a doubtful nuisance” I would ad-
vise a visit to portions of the Oberon dis-
trict. The erection of two miles of
netting, which friend wombat immedi-
ately started to lift out of the ground,
satisfied me. Treating this and other
fences with a dose of barbed wire at
bottom has been a costly and difficult—
though admittedly effective —job.
“W.P.T.”: An outsized wombat turn-
ing the scale at nearly 2001 b. was re-
cently caught in Victoria. A dog that
follows even the average 1001 b. size into
a burrow rarely comes out alive. The
solidly-built little fellow lies flat on the
floor and allows the dog to climb on his
back. He then rises on his powerful
legs and crushes the hound to pulp. Even
in the open he is more than a match for
the averagfe dog.

“T.S.”: “General Prac.” (B. 12/12/34)
asks: “Why have chicken-pox and
measles slain thousands amongst Pacific
islanders?” Where malaria is prevalent
in the Pacific the diseases mentioned
have not been responsible for the un-
usual number of deaths. The malaria-
stricken native retires to his hut at the
first sign of fever and curls up beside
his fire. In Fiji and other island groups
where malaria is unknown and the
natives are unaccustomed to fever, efforts
to reduce the bodily heat caused by
either chicken-pox or measles by im-
mersion in the nearest cold water is re-
sponsible for the abnormal death-rate.

THE MAN ON
THE LAND
THE STUFF TO GIVE'EM
MEGGITTS LINSEED MEAL
NECK WOOL.
“Warrego”: It is always advisable to
remove necks in a big clip when pos-
sible.
“B-gar” (B. 12/12/’34) cites North-
ampton Downs (Q.) necks as fetching
higher prices than the station’s top fleece
lines, and gives the reason that “neck
wool is finer, better-grown and better-
yielding than the balance of the fleece.”
Neck wool is free from extraneous
matter, better-yielding and often, though
not certainly, finer. But it is never better-
grown than the rest of the fleece. Gen-
erally, it is shoddier and contains more
foreign substances, and for this reason
particularly it should be removed. It is
only off relatively poor country that
necks sometimes bring better prices than
fleece lines. When a man insists on the
necks not being removed, my method
is to make the skirters remove only the
rough and discolored necks, allowing
them, if insufficient to make a five-bale
lot, to be worked into broken and first
pieces.
WOOLBINS.
“Sheepo”; Each should be large enough
to hold two bales at least. Partitions
must be such that wool cannot pass from
one bin to the other. Doors should be
on the press side and open outwards. If
there is no floor, bagging or hessian must
be laid down securely over the earth.
If the bin partitions are not boarded or
bagged, small mesh wire-netting, strained
tightly, will serve. Before shearing and
during cut-outs each bin should be
cleaned out thoroughly.
And it should be marked with con-
tents description to guide the pressers.
It saves mistakes.
The most central bins should always
be used for the biggest lines (not neces-
sarily for the best) and the widest for the
pieces, so that from time to time the
classer can get in and give the work of
the pickers the once-over. Empty packs
will be found more convenient for hold-
ing the locks, unless the bin partitions
are such that entry of the smallest pieces
of wool is precluded.
FLY-BLOW CONTROL.
“Square”: The blowfly will strike only
on favorable ground. It is part of its
job to deposit its larvae in . such environ-
ment as will ensure that the maggot will
survive.
A healthy exudation from the sheep’s
skin will not attract any blowfly (the
breech excepted). Any excess of yolk
in a healthy sheep becomes automatically
dissipated in the open air, per medium
of the wool fibre.
If, however, the sheep has been feed-
ing excessively (as in good seasons or
under humid conditions) the yolk exuded
is not only excessive, but the excess will
quickly break down on the sheep’s skin,
producing millions of bacteria and form-
ing a perfect striking point for the fly.
Ten years ago a preparation for blowfly
prevention was sponsored by a well-
known scientist, the theory of it being
that sheep inoculated with it must exude
on the skin a poison unfavorable to
the larvae of the fly. It proved a failure.
SHRINKAGE IN WOOL.
“R.A.”: “Valerin” (B. 19/12/’34) sug-
gested a rough and ready method of
reckoning what wool will yield when
clean-scoured. His idea is all right, but
it is necessary to experiment first as to
the quantity of soap to dissolve in the
water, and also with the temperature.
Should too much soap be used, the wool
will come from the bath partly felted
and knotty and would not be a reliable
guide as to the clean yield.
PIECE-PICKING.
“Right Angle”: “Marsh” (B. 19/12/’34)
has got “Toowong” tied up. As he says,
“Toowong’s” suggestion for conjointly
piece-picking and rolling a fleece, with a
big board of shearers, would snow them
all under with wool. Also, a big part of
the pieces would be trampled upon and
slung into the baskets ungraded, and
perhaps mixed with fribs and locks.
An untidy shed will help to produce an
untidy, badly-got-up clip. The writer
carried out “Toowong’s” suggestion with
a board of four shearers and one boy
to pick up.
There is a good thing in properly-
sorted pieces and bellies, and, in big sheds
especially, it is necessary to have experi-
enced piece-pickers.
Still, more classes than necessary
should not be made. The fewer the
classes the more easy the job for the
foreign buyers when they handle the
wool in sample-rooms. If the buyer
finds a clip classed intelligently to sound-
ness, length and condition and approxi-
mate wool count he will note the grower’s
brand for future inspection.
SHORTER SHEARING.
“Jay”: To my mind, points in favor
of nine months’ shearing are over-
whelmed by the objections to it. Long-
wool breeders should benefit, especially
in regard to mating, and it should in-
crease the total yield from merinos and
crossbreds, but at the sacrifice of length,
which is too great a price to pay. There
are plenty of other arguments against the
practice.
Wool-instructor J. M. Coleman men-
tions 4d. per sheep extra in shearing
costs, plus haulage charges, which will
counteract any increased yield. And
there are the ill-effects from extra hand-
ling, with the possibility of tetanus, which
often accompanies shearing, and heavy
mortality from blowfly in the summer,
when sheep carry seven and eight months’
wool.
FEEDING STOCK.
“Sorghum”; Where no grass is avail-
able sheep require 2-31 b. of chaff per
day. Feeding-troughs can be set up with
chaff bags opened out and sewed or fas-
tened to a frame of saplings, with a
length of piping along the bottom to
keep the trough firm. Fifty-feet of
troughing, with access to both sides,
will accommodate 100 sheep. Where
there is a little rough picking, a mixture
cap be fed consisting of wheat, oats and
nuts. A pound per sheep should be
enough.
The feed can be distributed through
a hole in the floor of a cart. This way
exercises the sheep which follow, and
also prevents them from getting an excess
ration.
For dairy cows mangolds are a
wonderful feed. When fresh, however,
they have a tendency to scour, and so
should be allowed to ripen. As they
contain nearly 90 per cent, of water, too
large a bulk of them would have to be
fed alone, and they should be fed pulped
with chaffed hay.
Many farmers in times of shortage
feed “rusty” hay to horses. This prac-
tice results in digestive derangement, and
may easily , prove fatal. If rusty hay is
left in the sun for a week the risk of
accident is reduced to a minimum.
CALCIUM DEFICIENCY.
“Cooloothin”: Lack of calcium in the
dairy herd ration is becoming a serious
problem in coastal Queensland.
The first sign is bone-chewing. This
in itself is dangerous. Frequently a
small bone lodges in the cow’s mouth,
and then she is unable to eat. There
is often a slight stiffness in the joints,
which later become's pronounced, the ani-
mal eventually dying of starvation. Some-
times death occurs after an acute phase.
An apparently well animal sickens and
dies within 24 hours, almost as though
poisoned.
The trouble is easier to prevent than
to cure. Give a lick of equal parts
of finely-ground rock phosphate, steril-
ised bonemeal and salt. The salt may be
reduced after the cows become used to
the lick. A little molasses and aniseed
can be added as a flavor.
If the cows will not eat the lick the
only method is a calcium drench. Put a
good handful of bonemeal and phosphate
in equal parts—no salt—in a straight-
necked beer-bottle. Fill with water,
shake well, and pour down the animal’s
throat. You can’t give too much.
The calcium drench will generally cure
the slower forms of the disease if given
daily for long enough periods, but the
acute form is pretty hopeless. A drench
of 11b. of Epsom salt with two table-
spoonfuls of ground ginger, followed
later by the calcium, sometimes pulls
them through.
SORE BACKS.
“W.D.Mc.”: “Blister” (B. 5/12/’34)
has still a bit to learn ; but I agree with
him that hot brine is waste of time, and
cold salt and water is much better,
especially if the back is immediately
dusted with boracic acid.
“Blister” says the sheepskin saddlecloth
is all “bosh.” I have been using one
for the last four years every day for from
8 to 10 hours per day. I weigh over
16st., and with saddle, etc., ride nearly
18st. ; but so far I have not given my
prad a bad back, and I award all the
credit to the sheep pelt.
Anyway, prevention is better than
cure, and where there is a good supply
of water a liberal use of the hose is the
best means of preventing scald, especially
if boracic acid is used freely.
. PINK-EYE AND PAIN.
■’ “Nosyd”:l have heard of salt, sugar,
bluestone and kerosene as pink-eye cures.
A speck of dust causes irritation. What
must some of those cause?
: Am affected eye is extremely tender,
and should be treated accordingly. Yard
all sheep, separate affected animals and
treat them right with a few drops
in each' eye of: — ./
Sulphate of zinc 10 grains
Extract of belladonna 10 grains
Distilled water 1 pint
Use boiled water if no distilled is avail-
able. Watch the flock for further cases,
and treat at once.
To a sheep in the final stage (ulcer)
apply daily:—•
Yellow oxide of mercury .... 16 grains
Boracic acid 1 drachm
Vaseline 2 ounces
Any chemist will make up these mixtures,
which assure a minimum of pain to the
animal. .
AMINO-ACIDS IN MILK.
“Bates”: As stated by “Stump-Jump”
(B. 5/12/’34) there may be some mis-
understanding regarding the origin of the
wool-producing amino-acid cystine, but
there is certainly none about proteins in
milk.
Bacteria play an insignificant part in
the digestion and assimilation of food-
stuffs by animals. This is done by diges-
tive juices and ferments.
Cow’s milk is not ideal for lambs, for
the same reason that it is not ideal for
infants. The composition of the milk
of all mammals is such as to suit the
nature of each animal. The average fat
in cow’s milk is roughly 3 to 4 per cent.,
in elephant’s 19.6 per cent, and in por-
poise’s 48.5 per cent.
Protein in cow’s milk constitutes 3.57
per cent., in mare’s 1.89 per cent, in cat’s
15.5 per cent.
’HOPPERS AND HARD FACTS.
“Lion”; That ’hoppers won’t attack
lucerne is a fallacy. A swarm arrived
here (Young, N.S.W.), and within three
days had cleaned up approximately 100
acres of the best we had. The rest of
the affected paddocks we saved by speedy
mowing.
It is the only way. Rake and cock
immediately off the mower. If hay is
left to cure the ’hoppers will eat it more
quickly than when standing.
We have noted young ’hoppers from
the eggbeds eight to 10 days after they
were laid, which is much quicker than is
generally thought. This fact increases
the menace. Mark breeding-places with
{Continued on page 24.)
£25 FOR SUCCESS STORIES.
Mostly Australia, hears of her farming failures, but there are many men
on the land who have a romantic record of success—men who started out,
with little capital, on rough scrub land, and made good despite low prices,
bad communications and high taxes; men who bought properties on which
others had failed and made them pay; men who began with nothing but
stock knowledge as capital and turned it to good account; men to whom
pasture improvement has brought a competence.
“The Bulletin” is offering prizes for stories of success in any branch
of farming, written by the parties themselves or by others to whom the facts
have been communicated. If the latter, proofs of genuineness must be
furnished.
First prize . . . . . . . . £2O
Second prize £3
Third prize £2
And ten “Bulletin” drawings by well-known artists. Space rates will
be paid for all non-prizewinning efforts published.
A story must not exceed eight hundred words in length. It must be
sent in an envelope addressed to the Editor and marked “Success Competition”
not later than January 31 next. The Editor’s decisions and awards will
be final.

“THE ‘WILD CAT' MONTHLY"
Australia’s leading financial journal, enables him to do
this and other things.
• December Issue Now on Sale
if any illustration in “THE BULLETIN” takes your fancy, write
to the MANAGER, who will quote you price for the original.
pegs, and watch carefully. The locusts
always choose the hard and bare places
where there is the minimum of vegeta-
tion for breeding.
Milking cows will do no good where
the ’hoppers have been for any length of
time. Our milk ration was reduced 50
per cent, in four days, and only a fresh
lucerne paddock revived it. Some small
dairies have been forced to hand-feed
because of this strange falling off in milk.
The ’hoppers seem to foul what they
leave, as far as cows and horses are con-
cerned.
The swarms eat the farmer out in
patches only, and heavy stocking with
sheep helps to hurry them on to the wing.
The damage which it is estimated they do
is not always nearly so bad as it is made
out to be, but it is bad enough.
“Albarmount”: “Valerin’s” warning
(B. 12/12/’34) about the potential menace
of the ’hoppers in autumn is timely. In
N.S.W., the pest is now rapidly spreading
to places that escaped their ravages last
summer. They came down on the
Mudgee lucerne flats, and stretch in an
almost unbroken line from there to Con-
dobolin and beyond.
If the hordes take their normal cycle
their myriads will increase manyfold to
plague us after February. What stout-
hearted farmer, especially after his ex-
perience last season, will risk sowing his
crop with this pest waiting to nibble it
off?
Dry weather may lessen their ravages ;
but ’hoppers don’t go down without a
fight, and the only place we can beat
them is on their hatching-grounds.
If they are allowed to breed unchecked
I can’t see anything for it but half a
wheat harvest next year.
N.S.W, WHEAT CROPS.
“The 0.D.”: I have just returned from
a tour of the N.S.W. wheat country. In
four weeks I travelled over most of the
country within a line from Inverell to
Mudgee, to Wellington, Cowra, Gunda-
gai, Albury, Corowa, Deniliquin, Hill-
ston, Condobolin, Tullamore, Trangie,
Gilgandra, Mendooran, Moree and back
to Inverell. It is impossible to exaggerate
the grasshopper position.
In many districts that were lush with
feed a few weeks ago there is nothing
but the ripe wheat and the tough tussocks
of the corkscrew grass. I saw grass-
hoppers (winged ones) settled on a crop
of Ford at night chewing the stalks be-
low the ears, ’hoppers climbing green
wheat near Cowra and chewing (or suck-
ing) the milky grains, swarms laying
eggs, young ’hoppers moving off from
breeding-grounds. All that can be hoped
for is some miracle that will wipe out
the plague, otherwise farmer and grazier
must wait for next autumn and organise
brigades as suggested by Harold Bartlett
six months ago.
Heavy storms of recent weeks tested
the wheat varieties. Dundee recovered
best from the knocking about. Rust was
prevalent everywhere, and late attacks
of take-all will reduce the Riverina yields.
The N.S.W. State Marketing Bureau’s
latest estimate was for a 42,000,000-
bushel crop. It is likely that grass-
hoppers, take-all and frost will reduce
that to about 38,000,000 bushels.
Between Wagga and Cowra, and par-
ticularly about Coolamon and Marrar
and south of the Junee-Narrandera line,
skeleton weed is putting some wheat pad-
docks out of commission. There are crops
in there that will not be harvested this
year. All that apparently lies ahead of
that part of the country is a reversion to
grazing, with lucerne sowing and pasture
improvement to smother out the curse.
What will happen to such purely wheat
towns as Marrar, Coolamon, Henty,
Lockhart, Culcairn, Ganmain and several
others in that event remains to be seen.
The five champion wheatgrowers of
N, S. Wales this year are: Waddell Bros.,
Inverell (north-west); Maynard and
Everett, Narromine (west); Rowland and
Son and Johnstone, Cowra (Central
Slopes); B. E. Zweck, Henty (Southern
Slopes), and Gemmel Bros, and Henry,
Ardelthan (Riverina), who each win a
trophy worth £2O from the R.A.S.
MULES FOR THE CANEFIELDS.
“Cudgerie”: I doubt if mules will ever
be a success on the canefields (“Breaker,”
B. 5/12/’34). Their hardiness cannot be
doubted, but they are far more suited to
dry inland than the wet coastal areas.
Small compact hoofs make them very
surefooted, but put them at a disadvan-
tage in soft boggy country. Old Dobbin
is a faithful animal; the average mule is
not. Work the inside out of a horse and
he will tackle the job the next day in
the same old spirit. In similar circum-
stances the hybrid would turn out a jib.
A mule will stand a gruelling, but once
you break his spirit he is useless.
THE HABITS OF LIGHTNING.
“F.L.8.”: “Pick” and “Catchpenny”
are right about lightning and stock (B.
5/12/’34). In South Africa I have seen
some of the world’s worst lightning,
which struck teams of bullocks, single
animals, human beings, fences or any-
thing that was in its path. I think there
is no hard-and-fast rule for any flash,
as lightning always takes the path of
least resistance, however devious.
In Australia I have seen fences struck
and fence-posts split. A neighboring sta-
tion had a colt killed last year by being
in contact with a wire fence that was
struck higher up.
Lightning regularly strikes in certain
places here, and any fence crossing that
area is just as likely to be hit as missed.
HINTS FOR THE FARM.
“Bundalinga”: Subterranean clover
will choke out St. John’s wort. Use 21b.
of sub. clover seed with lewt. of super-
phosphate to the acre.
“O’Caollaig”; A better remedy for
Strawberry’s sore teats (“0.W.W.,” B.
5/12/’34) is one to two parts of carbolic
fluid to about six of petroleum jelly or
vaseline. Petroleum jelly keeps the teats
soft, arid when mixed with the carbolic
is antiseptic and healing.
“Valerin”; Where fly trouble is in-
tense better results have been obtained
in doctoring lambs by cutting off top
of purse than by slitting. The former
secures perfect drainage of blood. In
any case the purse should be swabbed
with disinfectant —say, 3 pints castor oil,
2 pints Stockholm tar, 5 pints kero.,
i-pint turps, mixed thoroughly.
“Hope Vale”: The shearing-plant
emery-wheel can be used to sharpen
chisels, punches, chaffcutter-blades and
axes at record speed and with wonderful
accuracy. Care must be taken not to
press too heavily on the wheel, or the heat
generated by the high speed will spoil
the temper of the steel. The teeth of
header- and harvester-combs can also
be ground, but only by a highly skilful
person.
“Mimosa”: Milk can be used with
good results for feeding horses —par-
ticularly for colts and animals out of
condition or doing heavy work. If cows’
milk is to be substituted for mares’ milk
for young colts there should be an addi-
tion of a little sugar and limewater.
“Glenfield”: Algerian oats proved a boon
to the Vic. Malice farmers who sowed
them this year. From sowing time the
season seems to have run a month later
than normal, and when the late spring
rains arrived the early varieties of oats
had reached maturity where they had not
failed altogether owing to the excessively
dry spring. In many instances, where
Algerian oats had been sown for grazing
and eaten right off, fine crops of hay
were harvested after the stock had been
removed. Taken year in and year out,
Algerian is still the best variety to sow
for the Mallee, both for grazing and for
hay, owing to its ability to respond to
late rains.
QUESTIONS ANSWERED.
(Transferred from Service Department.)
I'want to blow up some stumps in a paddock,
but I have no wish to lose one or both hands
in the process, as, according to a recent par.
in The Bulletin, is sometimes done by fisher-
men on their unlawful occasions. Can anyone
(not theoretical ) give me a tip ? —4779.
If you have no experience with explosives,
don’t try it. A detonator is a dangerous thing
to play with, and, anyway, the blowing up of a
“few stumps” by anybody who does not know
the technique of the job is apt to be expensive.
If you are bent on using explosives, suggest
that you get a council man who knows his job
to give you practical instruction or do the
work for you.

THE SUMMER-CLOTHES
QUESTION.
Now the warm weather’s here we
should be more financial: once again we
will be able to pawn our overcoat.
Unfortunately, we will have to buy
summer clothes with the proceeds. We
are considering an athletic singlet and
cream trousers, but unless Isaacs allows
us a lot more than usual we will have
to forget the creams.
Of course, the singlet will not be suffi-
cient. We definitely need some sort of
trousers, for, confidentially, the ones we
are wearing are only fit for use under
the overcoat. If only the wife was one
of those useful women she might be
able to rig up that extra pair of pyjamas
for outdoor use. Or, at least, she could
“It’s raining, dear.”
“Does that stop play for to-night?”
lend us her slacks. It’s going to be very
monotonous if we have to stay in bed
all the summer.
Anyhow, there will be a residue after
purchasing the singlet, dnd we will spend
that on medicine. We consider that the
best medicine is beer.
Of course, if we didn’t buy the singlet
we could devote the whole proceeds to
medicine. After all, there is a lot to be
said for nudism.

A HAPPY OLD YEAR.
This New Year business is bunk. I
can see nothing at all in it that should
cause any sane, right-minded person to
become hilariously happy.
Boiled down to. essentials, there is no-
thing about the Ist of January that is
radically different from the 31st of
December, except the realisation that
work, settlement day, the Bankruptcy
Court, next Christmas and the grave are
all one day nearer.
Actually the two days are only separ-
ated by a split hiccup, and if your
clock happens to be fast or slow they
aren’t separated at all, but coalesce.
My chief objection to the business is
that New Year parties bring out the
worst in people. Although the party
starts long before midnight, no one gives
a thought to the Old Year, which is gasp-
ing out its last breath unheeded and
alone. Instead, all are eager in acclaim-
ing the New Year, which is ushered in
amid such a surfeit of flattery and adu-
lation that it takes it months to get over
it, and to realise that after all it is just
a year like any other year. By that time
people are tired of
it, and are eager for
the next.
It’s an old story.
“M ore worship
the rising than the
setting sun.”
My object in writ-
ing is to plead on
behalf of the Old
Year. After all, as
bad as it may have
been, we’ve got
through it. It has served us faithfully,
and has given us full measure —365 days,
an equal number of nights, 52 week-ends
and several hangovers.
What, on the other hand, has the New
Year done for us? Nothing! Abso-
lutely nothing. There is not even a guar-
antee that it will run its full course. In
fact, the only basis we have for assum-
ing that it will is the fact that all its
predecessors have done so —the years
that are now despised and forgotten in
the blaze of pageantry that greets the
new upstart 1935.
But mankind is always more appre-
ciative of promises than of performances.
“Watch me,” says 1935. “Here I am,
a brand-new year, unspoilt by contami-
nation with the past. I’ll show you how
the world should be run. I’ll give you
a good time. I’ll make you rich. Toast
me! Welcome me! Praise me! Ac-
claim me!”
And the infatuated fools drink long and
oft to the New Year, kiss every young
woman within reach, shake the hands
and pat the backs of fellows they’ve
never seen in their lives before, and deli-
ver themselves up, body and soul, to the
new idol. Is it any wonder they are
doing the same thing 12 months later?
What about myself? Did / celebrate?
, , . Well, I certainly went to a party, if
that’s what you mean. Was I hilarious?
... As far as I can recollect I achieved
a fair degree of hilarity. But my case
was different. You see, I was celebrat-
ing something worth while—the gather-
ing of an old and honored friend, the
late Mr. 1934, into arms of his
fathers.

CATACLYSM.
He lay prone and silent. Fear gripped
his heart. He was now perilously close
to the edge, and his grip was weakening.
He gazed down into the inky blackness
and felt sick. The upward current of
air chilled his limbs, while the huge force
behind barred his retreat. Could he
hold on or would he be hurled into the
void?
“Daddy’s ickle darlin’ go sleepy-bye—eh?”
He heard a deep rumble from the
mountain behind him. On his back he
felt the warmth of the approaching mass.
Many stones, he knew, would come with
it. This, then, was the end. The stern
reality was forced upon him. His wife
gave another backward heave, and the
poor wretch went sprawling on to the
floor.

CORROBORATED.
William perceived it just as he was
reeling past the shadowy laneway, and
he was so alarmed that he nearly dropped
his bottle.
It. was one of those flying dragons he
had always thought extinct. Its wings,
flapping restlessly, were attached to a
long, black body covered with shimmer-
ing red spots. Sharpening its claws on a
lamp-post, it regarded him menacingly.
William shrank back, colliding with
David, who had staggered to a standstill
against the wall.
“Look!” he muttered in an awed
voice, “Do you shee anything theresh?”
David looked, blear-eyed. Yes, there
was something there! He wasn’t quite
sure what it was, but at last he came to
the conclusion that it must be a death
adder, bright-red with black spots. There
was something strange about it though:
he had never before seen a snake with
horns.
“Yesh! I shee it!” he exclaimed, re-
treating.
William looked relieved. “Thank
heavensh!” he cried. “1 thought I had
the dingbatsh!”

DISGUISED.
“Policemen of the squads operating against
illegal gambling have distinguished themselves
by the adoption of disguises which completely
baffle the victims of their strategy.”— “Sim.”
Too right! We in our joint thought
police interference out of the ques-
tion the other night. We played old
maid for high stakes without fear, for
we knew that there were scouts at the
entrances back and front of the flats and
others at the street corner from whom
warning of any raid would be received
by secret wire installations.
“Another ha’penny in all round,” said
Muggins.
“No,” said Bloggs recklessly. “A
penny. Big game.”
The coins rattled on the table.
“Aha, gentlemen! Caught you in
the act!”
The voice came to us raspingly, mys-
teriously, and we all turned sharply to-
wards the wireless set. It was no longer
a wireless set. Constable Luck, who had
cleverly adopted the disguise of a radio,
stood before our astonished gaze.
Gamblers notoriously are desperate
men.
“He’s alone!” cried Bloggs. “It will
be simple to silence him.”
“Not so fast, gentlemen!” It was the
pedestalled aspidistra that spoke. It re-
vealed itself as Sergeant Largeface. He
uttered a call, and one of the bottles of
sly grog, bursting apart, revealed Con-
stable Squeezup, while Constable Mor-
tem materialised from the innocent-look-
ing suitcase that had been used, we
thought, to carry the beer.
“The game’s up,” said Largeface.
It was. If is no good flying in the
face of police who adopt such methods.
I’m thinking of turning to the side of
the law.
My ability to disguise myself as a
dumb-bell should be useful.

MIDNIGHT ALARM.
Midget was awakened just before mid-
night. Stones were thrown on his roof,
kerosene-tins were banged outside, his
gate was pulled off its hinges and his
dog was made to bark loudly.
Midget arose, tripped over two or
three scared cats and was hit in the eye
with a potato ; but he made his way to
the scene of the commotion. In large
letters on his newly-painted front fence
were tarred the words “Happy New
Year.”

THE CHEAT.
A haggard man entered the office of
the Registrar-General and waited diffi-
dently for an hour to get a word with
him. Finally he obtained an audience
with the secretary.
“I’ve cheated the Government! ”
whispered the haggard man, nervously
fingering the hat in his hands. “And
you want to make restitution?” inquired
the official. He had heard of such cases.
“How did you cheat the Government?
Evade the income-tax or steal something
from the Mint?” “No, no —none of
those things!” “Did you embezzle from
the post office savings bank?” “No,
never had anything to do with a bank.”
“Did you overcharge on a contract?”
“Not that either.” “Then how did you
cheat the Government?”
“Remember the census?” said the man,
furtively glancing over one shoulder.
“Well, when the census man came to my
place I didn’t give him my middle
name!”

THE LAST STRAW.
I try to stand the angler’s zeal
Who tells how whoppers got away ;
A certain sympathy I feel
For punters’ woes on settling day.
But human suffering stops at this

I won’t endure that gay young miss
Who will describe those seaside snaps.

Springs glibly from the lips of man

Because, my love, I’m satisfied
At finding faults you are unique!

Information Sought.
(1) If the Duke of Kent has a son will that
son be given preference in succession to the
throne over Princess Elizabeth ? (2) If the
Prince of Wales should die before his father
would the Duke of York be heir to the throne ?
—4812.
(1) Yes. (2) Yes.
I live in Vic. and have a small income from
a trust estate. At my death the principal goes
to my son. The money is invested in Tas. in
Government securities. In the event of my
death, how should my son proceed to get the
money or establish his identity ? He lives in
Vic., too. —4765.
Assuming the trust investment to be held by
trustees under a will, on your death, when pro-
bate has been granted, they will hand over the
principal, in whatever form it may be, to your
son. He should not have any difficulty in satis-
fying the trustees as to his identity.
(1) I am an old-age pensioner, and my life
is insured for £50. When I die does the Gov-
ernment claim this, or can I leave it to my son.
who lives with me and who has been unem-
ployed for two years ? (2) If 1 die owing rent
can the landlord claim my furniture from my
son ? —4344.
(1) All pension paid after 31/12/’34 will be a
debt due to the Commonwealth on the death
of a pensioner and be payable out of the
estate after all other debts have been paid.
Exemptions are made, however, in the case of
property which passes under the will of the
pensioner to a relative who is a pensioner, or is,
in the opinion of the Commissioner, in necessi-
tous circumstances, or was, at the death of the
pensioner, residing in a home owned by the
pensioner. (2) He could not seize and sell the
furniture, but he could claim against your
estate for the amount due.
(1) What war gratuity was paid to members
of the A.I.F., and for what period ? (2) What
did Australia borrow for war purposes ? —4588.
(1) The rate of war gratuity was Is. 6d. per
day, payable from date of embarkation over-
seas to date of declaration of peace (June 28,
1919). (2) Commonwealth war debt at June
30, 1927, was £296,905,370, of which
£201,332,522 was redeemable in Australia and
£95,572,848 in London. At June 30, 1934, the
total was £280,148,129—Australia £189,403,798,
London £90,744,381.
If an old-age pensioner left Australia to
■reside in England, could he still draw the
pension ? —4747.
No. Invalid and old-age pensions are pay-
able only to residents of the Commonwealth.
Origin of the Union Jack? —4915.
In the Middle Ages the English armies fought
under the red cross of St. George in a white
field as the sovereign’s banner. In 1707 the
white diagonal cross of St. Andrew on a blue
ground was added consequent upon the union
with Scotland, and in 1801 the red diagonal
cross of St. Patrick was added to the first
two to form the Great Union, or Union Jack.
What is meant by “king’s color” and “regi-
mental color” as applied to military ceremonial ?
—4943.
In 1751 a warrant was issued under which
each regiment was to have two colors only,
viz., the king’s color, to be the Great Union
(except for the Foot Guards), and the regi-
mental color, to be the color of the facing of
the uniform, with the union in the upper
canton. An exception was made in the case
of regiments whose uniforms were faced with
red or white; their regimental color was to be
the red cross of St. George in a white field and
a union in the upper canton. All colors are
silk, measuring 3ft. 9in. wide, 3ft. deep; staff
8ft. long.
(1) Which is the longer river, the Amazon
or the Mississippi? Please state lengths. (2)
How is the comparison affected if the Missouri
is counted part of the Mississippi ? (3) Is the
Amazon a freshwater river ? —4659.
• QLI he Amazon is the longer; it is reckoned
at 3400; the Mississippi at 2960 miles. (2) The
Missouri, which is a longer tributary than the
Upper Mississippi, would make the total
length of the Mississippi 4200 miles. (3) Fresh
water, of course; but there is a tide reaching
up 400 miles. On the other hand, there is an
outflowing current of 200 miles into the
Atlantic.
Treatment for lead-poisoning ( occupational ) ?
What precautions should be taken ? —4923.
With prompt preventive measures and cura-
tive treatment over a period, plumbism (or
lead-poisoning) can be arrested. Absolute
cleanliness is essential owing to danger of
absorption by means of the skin; meals should
not be taken before hands of the leadworker
are well washed. Eggs and fresh milk should
constitute the first meal of the day; a respirator
gives protection in dust-laden atmospheres
where lead compounds are present. Should
trouble develop, iodide of potassium may be
prescribed to dissolve accumulated lead salts
in the system. Frequent doses of Epsom salt
are usually given in conjunction with the above.
Particulars of the skin disease ichthyosis, the
cause, and is it curable at any stage ? —4940.
Also known as fish-skin disease, it is a
rare and incurable skin lesion. Cause is un-
known, but development suggests an inherited
trait in most cases. It varies greatly in severity
—the simple form exhibits an undue dryness of
the skin; a harsh, scaly configuration develops
with progress of the disease. If not removed
by frequent bathing, these scales tend to
accumulate and spread. Treatment demands
medical supervision—a skin specialist should
be consulted. Lanoline or cod-liver oil may
be employed for local application; the oil,
containing vitamins A and D, is also of value
internally.
Can you tell me something about phosgene
gas ? —4852.
Phosgene, also called carbon oxychloride and
carbonyl chloride, was used as a poison gas in
the Great War (1914-18). It causes a choking
sensation, with coughing and oedema of the
lungs; a copious, frothy sputum develops. The
victim becomes blue and cyanosed; if the early
effects are not fatal, death may occur later from
broncho-pneumonia. Apart from damage to
lung and bronchial tissues, both central and
sympathetic nervous systems may be affected;
functional symptoms also involve respiration
and pulse. Modern treatment gives satisfactory
results.
Uses of Glauber’s salt, and is it named after
its discoverer ? —4774.
The salt is the active constituent of many
natural saline waters (Carlsbad, Marienbad,
etc.). Average dosage is from \to 1 teaspoon,
but larger doses may be taken as required. It
is useful in cases of habitual constipation, gall-
stone, hepatic dyspepsia, rheumatic affections
and other conditions demanding an active elimi-
nation. It is named after its discoverer, John
Rudolph Glauber (Carlstadt, 1603). He gave
the salt the name of Sal Admirabile.
What is the Rosetta stone, and by whom and
when was it discovered?- —4918.
An inscribed black basalt slab found near
Rosetta in Lower Egypt by Boussard, one of
Napoleon’s officers, in 1799, and acquired by
Great Britain at the capitulation of Alexandria
in 1801. This stone supplied Champollion with
the key for the decipherment of inscriptions
on the ancient monuments of Egypt. It is
written in hieroglyphic, demotic and Greek
characters —a decree of priests assembled at
Memphis. It is now in the British Museum.
In John Masefield’s “Spanish Waters” there
is mention of “pots of old Arica bronze” and
of “bezoar stones from Gayaguil.” What is
referred to ? —4751.
Old bronzes of the Incas of Peru came
from Arica. Bezoar derives from two Per-
sian words meaning counter-poison, or anti-
dote. It is a concretion or ball, caused
by indigestion, sometimes found in the stomachs
of goats or antelopes, and in olden times
imagined to have medicinal virtues, for poison-
ing in particular.
Derivation of the surname “Groom” ? —4891.
An occupational name, but some of the
Groom family trace their descent from the
Graeme clan of Scotland. The ancestor of
Ellen Douglas (“The Lady of the Lake”) was
first called Graeme, next Grome, then Groom
(among the English).
Origin of the significance attached to mistle-
toe ?-—4943.
From prehistoric times mistletoe has been a
sacred plant, connected with the regal and
religious superstitions, rites and ceremonies of
practically all European peoples. It was a
phallic symbol.
How is rubber-sponge made ? —4624.
Modern methods of production are more or
less a trade secret. In one process that has
been published a solution of rubber in carbon
disulphide or chloroform is quickly heated in
order that the solvent will distend the mass and
produce the cellular structure. Another method
is to place a very viscous solution of rubber
in the bottom of a tall metal vessel and heat
slowly to above the boiling point of the rubber
solvent. A sponge with very fine pores is thus
obtained.
Are any good results obtained through sowing
seed at particular phases of the moon ? —4937.
It is an Old-World theory that vegetable seed
sown when the moon is new will germinate
better and the plants are more sturdy.
Meaning of the references in old books to
rosemary and Queen of Hungary water ?
What was the original formula ? —4946.
Many old books and some modern ones tell
the legend of the Queen of Hungary and her
rosemary remedy for gout. The recipe is: Take
aqua vita, four times distilled, 3 parts, tops
and flowers of rosemary 2 parts. Put these
together in a closed vessel; let them stand in a
gentle heat for 50 hours, and then distil them.
Take one teaspoon and let your face and dis-
eased limb be washed with it each morning.
What is the legend of Marpessa 7 —4669.
Apollo was in love with Marpessa, but Idas
carried her off in a winged chariot which
Poseidon (Neptune) had given him. Evenus
(Marpessa’s father) could not overtake Idas,
but Apollo found him and took the maiden
from him. The lovers fought for her posses-
sion, but Zeus separated them and left the de-
cision with Marpessa. She chose Idas, fearing
that Apollo might desert her when she grew old.
When was the landscape in the N.S.W.
National Gallery by Harpignies acquired and
what was the status of the painter 7 —4869.
Bought in 1911. Henri Joseph Harpignies
was born in 1819, and painted from boyhood
until well after he was 90 years old. The last
of the great Barbizon school, he was a pupil
of Alexander Achard and intimate of Corot,
Bousseau and Francais.
Any information about Ghirlandaio the
painter 7 —4789.
Ghirlandaio was a nickname. His proper
name was Domenico Bigordi, and he was born
in Florence in 1499 at the crest of the Floren-
tine Renaissance, of which his work bears the
strongest marks. Like many of the great
Italian painters, he began as a goldsmith,
and all his works show a love of render-
ing jewellery and rich brocades woven with
gold and silver thread in the medium of paint.
What exactly is Sheffield plate, name of in-
ventor, if any, and any dates which might help
a collector 7 Are there any good books on the
subject 7 —4799.
A kind of silver plating which differs from
all other platings because the silver is fused
on to the base metal before making up. The
earliest Sheffield was fused on to copper; later
German silver was used as a base. The
process was discovered by Thomas Bolsover in
1742, at a time when economic conditions led
to a demand for metalware cheaper than solid
silver and superior to “Treene” and pewter
tableware then in common use. It was most
successfully developed by Bolsover’s apprentice
and successor, Joseph Hancock, and flourished
until the advent of electro-plating, which finally
killed the industry. Any book on plate-collect-
ing will contain the various marks. The best
on the subject is “Sheffield Plate,” by Henry
Newton Veitch, published by Bell and Sons,
London.
/ have a bowl marked on the bottom with
a crown above “Coalport, 1753.” Is it of any
value ? —4418.
The mark is a trade-mark, not a date, and
refers to a claim that the Coalport factory was
established at this early date. But the town
was not then known as Coalport. It was Coal-
brookdale, and the name Coalport has only
been used since 1816. The bowl has no special
value and no claim to antiquity.
What is the sequel or sequels, in order, if
any, to “Chicot the Jester,” by Dumas ?
4787.
Chicot has a big part in “La Dame de Mon-
soreau,” sequel to “Marguerite de Valois,” and
a small part in “The Forty-five Guardsmen,”
following.
In what poem do the following lines
appear ? :
Let us then be what we are, and speak what we
think, and in all things
Keep ourselves loyal to truth and the sacred profes-
sions of friendship.
—4699.
In Longfellow’s “Courtship of Miles Stan-
dish.”
(1) Who wrote
A late lark twitters from the quiet skies;
And from the west, where the sun, his day’s work
ended, lingers as in content”....
(2) And how does it continue ?—4705.
(1) W. E. Henley, published in “Echoes.”
(2):
There falls on the old, grey city
An influence luminous and serene,
A shining peace.
There are two additional verses.
Who was Proserpine, and was she connected
in any way with Persephone ? —4719.
Proserpine (in Latin, Proserpina; in Greek,
Persephone) was the daughter of Zeus and
Demeter (Ceres). She was abducted by Pluto,
god of the underworld.
(1) When and by whom was photography in-
vented ? (2) Information concerning the early
processes ? —4860.
(1) and (2) It was invented by no one man.
The blackening of silver salts was known in
1565; in 1727, when J. H. Schulze used a
mixture of silver nitrate and chalk, it was
recognised that this darkening was due to
light, not heat. The essentials of photo-
graphy, using silver nitrate as the sen-
sitive agent, were described by Wedgwood in
England in 1802. The use of hyposulphate of
soda as a fixative had been discovered by Chaus-
sier three years earlier. Niepce and Daguerre,
in partnership, were the pioneer practical photo-
graphers, and made many useful discoveries.
Fox Talbot, however, perfected a system of
printing on paper before the daguerreotype pro-
cess was published, and to Talbot and to Eng-
land belongs the credit for the calotype process.
Next important advance was the introduction
of the collodion base by Archer, of London, in
1850. The discovery of the dry plate was an-
nounced in England by G. R. Muirhead in 1854.
but was first successfully exploited in France.
The beautiful platinotype process was intro-
duced by W. Willis in England in 1874,

Sufferers—Act on
this advice To-day
NEW-PRINCIPLE REMEDY
BRINGS NEW HOPE!
Miserable, indeed, is the man or
woman whose stomach does not work
properly. Even the first symptoms of
something wrong are distressing-
palpitation, wind, flushing, belching, or
griping pains. But when this condition
has been allowed to persist without
check, the continued acidity actually
attacks the fabric of the stomach.
Then you get chronic dyspepsia, pain-
ful gastritis, colitis, and the dangers
of ulcerated stomach or bowel, with
intense pain day and night.
While the distressing symptoms of
wind, palpitation and flushing are bad
enough, the unfortunate sufferer begins
to learn what real agony means when
the stomach is inflamed or ulcerated.
Constant gnawing pain and the dread
of an operation is always in his thoughts.
No wonder people who have obtained
relief by using De Witt’s Antacid
Powder write us such grateful letters.
You dare not neglect
that griping pain !
To those who have any pain or
distress in their digestive organs, we
confidently recommend De Witt’s Ant-
acid Powder. This preparation acts
in a three-fold way.
Firstly, it neutralises the excess acid
which the stomach continually pro-
duces, and allays the irritation.
Secondly, the ulcers are coated with
a film of colloidal-kaolin. So finely
powdered is this kaolin, it is easily
spread over the entire surface of the
stomach, protecting the inflamed lining
from the hot, burning acids.
Thirdly, it actually digests portions
of your food, thereby still further taking
the load off the weakened stomach, and
finally, the ingredients in De Witt’s
Antacid Powder build up an alkaline
reserve in the body, that, with ordinary
care, there will be no recurrence of your
trouble. Then your pains leave you for
good; you enjoy your food and it does
you good.
Every day that you delay in getting
a supply of this new and wonderful
preparation means a day of unnecessary
suffering for you.

“Crank On”: Apropos the discovery
of Australians in unexpected places, I
ran into two when the British talkie
based on “Lorna Doone” was being shot.
In the fight scene between Carver Doone
and Jan Ridd, which occurs after Carver
has shot down Lorna at the altar, the
actors proved insufficiently ferocious ; so
the director got hold of doubles —
Maurice Reynolds, the Tasmanian boxer
and “all-in” wrestler, and James Regan,
mother Australian. Reynolds doubles for
John Loder (Jan Ridd), Regan fights to
the death for Roy Emerton (Carver
Doone).

“G. Trotter”: Australians accustomed
to seeing pictures of magnificent Ameri-
can hotels, solidly built of steel and con-
crete, are mystified at the loss of life
that occurs during fires such as that at
Lansing (Michigan) the other day. But the
average A-class building in the U.S. is
merely a solid shell of fireproof material.
Inside it is divided up by wooden par-
titions, often of the most flimsy character ;
and if one of these catches fire and a
wind happens to sweep in the whole floor
is raging. It is not long before the huge
“fireproof” skyscraper becomes merely a
flue up which ihe flames roar. The fire-
escapes fitted to every American building
of any size are largely a joke ; they do
nothing but ruin the architectural beauty
of the building and afford gangsters a
getaway. When fire occurs they are
worse than useless.

Australia has solid things to
thank royalty for. It was the visit of the
Duke of Edinburgh in the ’sixties which
killed for ever the ancient fashion of men
turning out on festive occasions in
gloves, H.R.H. laid the foundation stone
of the Melbourne Town Hall with his
own hands, and all those about surrep-
titiously stripped their own gloves off
behind their backs, never to don them
again. Now the Duke of Gloucester has
adopted the sensible idea of taking off
his coat in hot weather, lunching at
Morere (M.L.) in his shirt sleeves, with
his entourage similarly logical, U.S.A. has
long adopted the shirt-sleeved mode in
hot weather. Go into any American
bank when the temperature is over 80,
and you 11 find all the tellers and ledger-
keepers in their shirt sleeves. So it is with
the customers in the restaurants, the
pedestrians in the streets and even the
cops, looking smarter than ever in their
blue vestless shirts and their bandolier
of cartridges around their waists. Visit-
ing Yanks weep over the insane way we
dress our police on point duty during
summer months.

WILL THE CHANGE-SPEED TYPE OF
GEARBOX BE SUPERSEDED?
ADVANTAGES OF MODERN TRANSMISSION SYSTEMS.
By FRED BERRY.
AR designers, ever since motoring commenced, have
endeavored to evolve an infinitely variable gear and so
obviate the many disadvantages of the conventional “mangle”
type of gearbox. While the quest is not yet ended, the idea
is growing steadily nearer attainment.
While it must be admitted that modern
gearboxes require but little skill in their
manipulation, as with synchromesh
gears, free-wheeling and automatic
clutches a child can operate the gear-
lever without fear of damage, every
modern designer is fully aware that con-
ventional gearboxes abound in short-
comings. Every motorist knows that his
engine power falls away rapidly as the
revs, drop until, at idling speed, only
perhaps one-sixth of maximum power is
available and, except under exceptionally
favorable circumstances, it is impossible
to use peak engine power.
No sound arguments can be pro-
pounded in favor of the retention of
Graph of ratios in conventional four-
speed systems, as against the ideal curve
of an infinitely variable gearing.
gearboxes, for even eight-speed gears,
while in some slight degree improving
road performance in the hands of
faddists, have introduced added compli-
cation in adjustment and involved greater
cost in maintenance. The great stumbling-
block in the way of progress has been
that designers have insisted that a trans-
mission system must be “solid” to be
efficient, meaning, of course, that when
the clutch is engaged power must be
transmitted through metal to the road
wheels.
Early Types.
Seven years ago two Continental ex-
perimenters. Constantinesco and De
Lauvaud, proved by different methods how
futile were these conventional ideas.
Constantinesco, with his infinitely vari-
able transmission, incorporating a pen-
dulum control and special form of roller
clutch, ran a standard car for some
months under official observation with-
out recourse to clutch or gear-lever, and
the power unit was rated at h.p.
About the same time tests of the De
Lauvaud schwasch-plate free-wheeling
differential demonstrated conclusively
that with this device motorists could
change gears at random once the car was
in motion without releasing the clutch,
and, further, that the rear wheels would
not slip in soft or greasy going, the wheel
on solid ground taking the drive.
Despite the undoubted efficiency of
both these ingenious principles, they
were never produced on a commercial
basis simply because the “solid” drive,
with its attendant high cost of produc-
tion, is insisted upon.
Indirect Transmission.
That convention should so stultify
progress is astonishing when we realise
that engineers, long before cars were
first used, knew the utility and efficiency
of fluid transmission as applied in con-
nection with water turbines. Later in
marine engineering fluid transmissions in
connection with electrical power plants
gave an infinite range of speeds.
In the case of electricity, the considera-
tions weighing against application to the
motor-car have been prime cost and
excessive weight—of course a car cannot
be hydraulically propelled—but these ex-
periments in other fields have served a
useful purpose in broadening the vision
of designers and turning their thoughts
away from conventional channels.
It seems probable that automobile
transmission principles will undergo revo-
lutionary changes in the near future, and,
while the gearbox may still be retained
in some instances as a subsidiary unit,
perfection in applying the substituted
principle should result in its total elimi-
nation.
In reviewing the 1935 models, one is
impressed with the consistent endeavor
on the part of designers to improve
transmission systems. Synchromesh
gears, with attendant freedom from
worry in gear-changing, are now standard
equipment in almost every model.
Though a number of self-change gear-
boxes have been fitted, they only partly
approach the ideal, for, successful
though they may be, each suffers from
the same disability—that in any particu-
lar ratio the motor cannot deliver its
maximum power except for brief periods.
Slipping Clutches.
Were it possible to fit some type of
clutch wherein a progressive slip could
be obtained whilst the drive was in some
particular ratio, we would in effect secure
an infinitely variable gear—unorthodox,
perhaps, mechanically, yet effective.
In this connection we have two out-
standing examples. The Newton centri-
Four-speed synchromesh gearbox, using
helical-cut teeth on constant-mesh
pinions.
fugal clutch fitted to a number of English
cars incorporates a series of bob-weights
which, as engine speeds increase, progres-
sively apply the load to friction surfaces
through a series of springs, and so permit
peak power to be developed by the
engine at any road speed. The other
design is the Austin-Hayes automatic
frictional transmission, which, after
having been submitted to practical tests
for some time, has now been adopted as
standard practice by one of the leading
English manufacturers.
Automatic Transmission.
Motorists will be extremely interested
in this ingenious system chiefly because

ment of bob-weights and sun wheels on

the only control provided is a miniature
lever for purposes of selecting ahead,
neutral or reverse, after which the ratio
automatically varies to suit the speed or
grade over which the car is being driven.
Differing somewhat in design, Alvis
have this year adopted a traffic clutch in
which the object is to permit slip, with
consequent enhanced power output on
any given gear. In this ingenious clutch
the flywheel, or disc, is bolted to the
driving shaft, and in its centre is a
doubly-flanged annulus. Within the outer
circle of this disc-clutch shoes are
mounted on pivots passing through the
disc and have their linings facing the
outer circumference. Coil springs in
compression, carried by radially-disposed
guide bolts, contract the shoes in an
inward direction ; consequently when the
driving disc exceeds a certain revolution
speed centrifugal force causes the shoes
to open outwards, at first lightly so that
slip may take place, and then, as speed
mu eases, with sufficient force to totally
eliminate slip and provide a solid drive.
While these novel schemes will in some
measure improve existing transmission
methods, they are at best merely a com-
promise. Any device depending solely
upon “slip” for its effective operation is
fundamentally unsound and certain to be
superseded by more effective measures,
An Australian Idea.
In this connection the Hobbs auto-
matic gear (an Australian invention) and
the Daimler fluid flywheel, with its vari-
ous modifications, are outstanding ex-
amples of novel transmission systems
that are yet sound in principle—the
latter at least having rapidly grown in
favor and being standard equipment on
a number of this year’s cars.
In the Hobbs gear the flywheel carries
near its rim two horizontal pins. On
each pin is a pinion and a balance-
weight, the whole free to rotate around
the pin. With teeth meshing those of the
pinions is a sun wheel on the propeller
shaft. The effort required to drive the
car is that necessary to turn the road
wheels —in this plan equal to the effort
in turning the sun wheels ; so, if the rear
wheels are locked, the revolving flywheel,
pinions and balance-weights would run
round the sun wheel on their pins. In-
versely the rotation of the flywheel pins
and pinions at high speed causes the
balance-weights to fly out by centrifugal
force, and, if the speed is high enough to
prevent the pinions rotating on their pins,
they drag the sun wheel round at exactly
the same speed as the flywheel—direct
gear.
Should the effort necessary to turn the
sun wheel become greater, such as when
climbing a grade, then it becomes im-
possible for the centrifugal effort to
maintain the pinions stationary on the
pins, and so they rotate slowly, still going
round with the flywheel, but permitting
a higher engine speed than that of the
flywheel; and the more the pinions rotate
the faster the engine turns in relation to
the sun wheel —in effect, an infinitely
variable gearing.
Fluid Flywheel.
The fluid flywheel also provides an
infinite ratio as between engine and
road wheels, but the result is achieved
without mechanical complication. Refer-
ence to the accompanying sectional
drawing will assist understanding of its
function. The driving member is bolted
to the crankshaft, while the rear is housed
in an oiltight casing. Both members
have an annular ring of semicircular
cross-section facing each other, and
divided up by a series of radial webs
into a number of segmental cells. The
whole device being immersed in oil, it
follows that, once the driving member is
rotated, oil impinges upon the radial of
the driven member, so tending to make

wheel, showing segmented cells formed

it rotate. Whether it rotates or not
depends upon the resistance offered to
the fluid ; and in actual practice, once the
engine turns at a high enough speed, the
car moves off silently and without shock.
Variation in gear is obtained by “slip”
between driving and driven member,

AN IMPORTANT
ANNOUNCEMENT
Because of a misconceived idea that the
red dye used as a colour is harmful, some
motorists are denying themselves the amaz-
ingly improved motoring performance pro-
vided by Super Plume Ethyl,
The colouring matter used in the foods we
eat daily is harmless to our systems. The
colouring matter in. Super Plume Ethyl is
just as harmless to an engine.
The amount of harmless aniline dye, added
in LIQUID form, is extremely small-—less
than a thimbleful to one thousand gallons.
The dye burns as completely as the Motor
Spirit. IT LEAVES NO DEPOSIT OF ANY
KIND —but

rapidly decreases until at speeds of over
1500 revs. p.m. it practically disappears,
giving, in effect, a “direct top.”
At the present time gearboxes or
tongue converters are fitted to cars
equipped with fluid flywheels merely to
provide more rapid acceleration and
better hill-climbing, but there can be no
doubt that in the near future, with the
principle perfected as the result of ex-
periments under service conditions, some
type of fluid transmission will displace
the present-day conventional gearbox.
Motor Oddities.
“Speeding Parson”: Travelling into
Coonamble (N.S.W.) one summer’s after-
noon, I encountered a fearful thunder-
storm. After a mile or so of the jazzing
met with on earth roads in rain, my Chev.
stalled. I ran the battery down, but the
only response from the engine was a
sound as though all cylinders were try-
ing to fire at once. As soon as the rain
ceased I checked points, carburettor and
timing, but all were in order. Near me
was a bushman stalled with water in the
magneto of his car. He sauntered over
and said, “I once saw a battery-ignition
car stalled in a thunderstorm, and it was
started by earthing the frame.” I dug
my jack-handle into the ground and ran
a wire from the chassis: two pulls on
the handle and the car started, running
sweetly thereafter.
The Trouble Lamp.
E-N.M. (Stanthorpe, Q.). —My six-cylinder
engine has run only 6000 miles since reboring,
and now oil consumption is increasing to an
alarming extent, while the exhaust smokes a
great deal when starting off. Cause and cure ?
Probably piston rings are at fault. Fit an
oil-scraper ring at the bottom of the piston
skirt and drill a series of |-in. holes behind
the centre top ring in each piston. This will
prevent excess oil entering the combustion
chamber.
Cautious (Windsor, N.S.W.).— My U-h.p.
six-cylinder car has done 23,000 miles. Plugs
soot up quickly, causing misfiring. Petrol con-
sumption is 18-20 m.p.g., and I am advised to
have the motor rebored. Is there any other
remedy ?
An experienced mechanic should be able to
determine, on examination of spark plugs,
whether sooting up is due to excess oil or over-
rich mixture. If the cylinders are badly worn
and oil is passing the rings, the plug points will
be coated with a soft, dark deposit. Your poor
fuel consumption, however, may indicate a
very rich mixture, which, in turn, will tend
to foul the plugs, deposit on points in this
case being hard and of a greyish tint. Try
altering the carburettor setting before going to
the expense of having cylinders rebored.
O B. (Goondiwmdi, Q.). — Lately, if I attempt
a long run and drive my 1933 model car a little
faster than usual, the motor gets rather hot
and about every five miles splutters and pops,
blowing down for a minute or two cures the
popping temporarily. Water circulation is in
good order, valves are correctly set, ignition in
good order and compression good. What is the
matter ?
Your motor is equipped with a mechanical
tuet pump, and, either due to wear of the oper-
ating gear, a cracked diaphragm or leaky gasket,
the pump will not deliver a full supply to the
carburettor. Consequently when driven fast the
drain m the carburettor exceeds the fuel
supply, giving rise to symptoms such as you
describe.
A-W. (Camberwell, Vic.) —Lubricant spins
out of the Spicer universal joint on my nearly-
new car. Any remedy ?
Either you are over-lubricating the joint or
using an inferior grease which melts readily
with heat.
(Kdvinhaugh, Q.). —My tractor is now
using 40 gallons per day in its cooling system.
Cylinder block is new, but radiator is old. I
suspect that bore-water has furred the radiator
tubes. How can 1 clear it ?
Use l 5 c - solution of hydrochloric acid and
water. Allow to stand overnight, then flush out
with clean water made alkaline with washing
soda. Reaction is slow, and the job must be
done several times. Forcing a high-pressure
stream of water through the bottom opening
will assist in clearing away the dislodged stuff.
B.L. (Waverley, N.S.W.). —In your descrip-
tion of the Willys “77” you mention the pistons
being of aluminium alloy. Is that correct ?
Pistons are now made of close-grained grey
cast-iron.
lop Gear (Quilpie, Q.). —My eight-cylinder
car has now done 10,000 miles, and is starting
to he heavy on oil. Would it be worth while
adding colloidal graphite at this stage to tighten
up the motor ?
Colloidal graphite will not give any benefit at
this stage, and cannot possibly reduce oil con-
sumption.

THE WIDE-WORLD FOUR
SHORT-WAVE AND BROADCAST RECEIVER.
By DON B. KNOCK.
Designed specially for use in remote locations, such as North Queensland
and New Guinea, this receiver was described in B. 18\7\’34. The issue
is now out of print, and, in response to numerous requests for information,
this battery-type receiver is again briefly described.
Many years ago the writer built and
described a short-wave receiver intro-
ducing for the first time in Australia
the screen-grid valve applied as tuned
R.F. amplifier for short waves. This
receiver, known as the All-Empire,
was also the beginning of the metal-
chassis era. 'file name chosen em-
bodied the idea that Empire broadcast-
Ing would soon become part of our every-

The R.F. stage is at the left and detector at the right,
with audio channel at the rear.
day life, and 1934 saw the firm estab-
lishment of British and other overseas
broadcasting services. Such short-wave
broadcasting is now listened to regularly
in Australian homes as entertainment,
and not as a mere experiment. With a
separately-tuned R.F. amplifier, if one
doesn’t mind the extra control, a very
fine performance can be obtained from
a regenerative detector and audio as-
sembly. The Wide-World Four is such
a receiver, and is much more efficient
than the original All-Empire type for
various reasons.
In the first place, it is extremely eco-
nomical on B batteries, being designed
with a Class-B audio channel. With
large-sized batteries, such as the Dia-
mond Mammoth, the best part of a year’s
operation can be expected. The audio
channel, with a permag. speaker of the
Amplion type, gives up to two watts un-
distorted output. Although designed
primarily as a short-wave receiver, a very
good long-range performance can be ob-
tained with coils made to cover the
broadcast band. Selectivity, of course,
cannot be compared with a superhetero-
dyne, but this is not of vital necessity
in the places where it is intended this
receiver should be used. The valves are
of the two-volt type, with a special
indirectly-heated R.F. pentode used as
electron-coupled regenerative detector,
and the four valves take a little over half
an ampere from the two-volt accumu-
lator. If this is of high ampere-hour
capacity, it follows that recharging will
be a casual business.
Circuit Points.
Reference to the circuit diagram shows
the complete straightforwardness of the
receiver, which has no unnecessary frills.
When dealing with short-wave receivers
of the regenerative kind it is a good rule
to remember that the more simple they
are the better they work. A 32- or 34-
lype valve is used as the amplifier, the
15 as detector, a type-30 driver audio
valve and the Class-B type-19 twin valve.
The socket connections for the 15, which
can be obtained in Sylvania make, cor-
respond to the 24A, 35 or 36 connec-
tions of a Radiotron characteristic chart.
The R.F. stage is shunt-fed and capacity-
coupled to the detector, but the capacity
should not exceed 20 mmfd. Such small
fixed condensers are now on the market.
An old adjustable neutralising condenser
would make a good coupling here. The
capacity must be small, otherwise, unless
there is very complete screening-off be-
tween the tuned R.F. stage and the detec-
tor, interlocking or “pulling” of the de-
tector will result. Note the audio coupling
in the plate circuit of the 15 detector.
This is most important, and the substitu-
tion of resistance coupling will only lead
to disappointment. Resistance coupling
would be quite in order if a high initial
plate voltage were practicable. The drop
across a .25 meg. resistor, necessary to
couple a valve with a high plate im-
pedance, is considerable. With the
audio coupling by means of a special
choke a normal 135- or 180-volt B battery
supply can be used, and the valve is not
starved for plate voltage. This choke
can be obtained in either Lekmek or
A.W.A. make, and possibly other manu-
facturers are now producing it.
For the sake of simplicity plug-in coils
are used, and if these are ruggedly made
and doped with cellulose lacquer they
will be impervious to moisture and will
retain their calibration. Valve-base coils
are definitely out for many reasons. Use
only good coil formers, such as the Mar-
quis ribbed type. Although a 250,000-ohm
potentiometer is shown as the regenera-
tion control in the screen-grid circuit of
the 15 detector, this can be either 50,000,
100,000, or 250,000 ohms. A Centralab
was used in the original, and there are
now several excellent makes of smooth
and silent potentiometers on the market,
including Yaxley, I.R.C. and Centralab.
One of these three is recommended defi-
nitely. In the screen-grid circuit of the
R.F. amplifier is a 100,000-ohm poten-
tiometer. This is not strictly essential,
but can be of advantage in obtaining a
good balance of the regeneration point.
Variation of this voltage will affect the
regeneration-control setting of the detec-
tor. If the circuits are correctly ar-
ranged for potentials and the amount
of cathode coil coupling for feedback in
the detector this potentiometer can be
dispensed with and a 100,000-ohm fixed
resistor used. The Class-B driver trans-
former is of importance, and the Airzone
make is recommended, being designed
for use with the 19 twin valve. The out-
put transformer is fitted as part of the
Amplion permag. speaker.
Constructional Points.
An aluminium chassis measuring llin.
by lOin. by 2Jin. is required, with a
front panel 12in. by Bin., an inter-stage
screening partition 7in. by 5 Jin., and a
rear partition llin. by 5JinV Both the
partitions have a half-inch angle-piece
along the longer dimension, for bolting
to the top of the chassis. The variable
condensers recommended are Jackson
special insulated rotor short-wave type
of .0002 mfd. capacity. These condensers
have the rotor insulated from the frame,
and may be earthed directly. They are
noiseless in operaton, and are obtainable
in Sydney from Murdoch’s, Ltd., Park-
street. A volume control is fitted in the
grid circuit of the 30 driver valve, and
this is a 250,000-ohm potentiometer. It
is not strictly necessary for speaker re-
ception, as the backing off of regenera-
tion will take care of this, but it is an
asset for headphone use. Headphones
can be used across the secondary of the
driver transformer, as in the circuit
diagram, in which case the Class-B valve
can be removed from the socket. A good
idea is to use a six-pin plug for the
headphones, with the connections made
to the two grid pins. This is inserted in
place of the 19 valve. Alternatively, two
permanent terminals can be provided at
the back or side of the chassis. A

midget variable condenser. If the re-
ceiver is to be used much on normal
broadcast at long distances from stations,
this condenser size can be increased with
advantage up to 23 plates. Only a very
small capacity is wanted for short waves,
and in this case the condenser plates
would be set at almost minimum capa-
city. The detector-plate circuit is
decoupled to ensure audio stability by
the inclusion of a 5000-ohm resistor and
.1 mfd. condenser as shown.

One Amplion type 01 permagnetic speaker with
Class-B transformer.
Extra; One pair of headphones.
The wiring in the tuned circuits should
be done with 16 tinned copper and in-
sulating sleeving, to keep everything as
rigid as possible, and wiring flex can be
used elsewhere. Either 135 or 180 volts
of B battery may be used, and the lower
voltage is ample for ordinary work. The
driver valve can be slightly over-biased ;
as much as the full nine volts if extreme
economy is desirable, but there is a
tendency to distortion at this point, and
reduction to six volts may be necessary,
If oscillation does not take place
smoothly in the detector, a little juggling
with the number of turns and the
position of the cathode coil on the parti-
cular coil unit may be needed. Although
this receiver is very sensitive and will
give good reception with only a small
aerial, height and insulation should not
be neglected, particularly in distant loca-
tions. One hundred feet of aerial, in-
eluding lead-in, will be sufficient.

THE RETROSPECTIVE THIRTIES.
On the threshold of a new year the
thoughtful soul pauses a moment to look
back along the road. Yes, this has been
a wonderful century, so far as it has
gone. It has added the automobile, the
aeroplane, the cinema, the gramophone
and radio broadcasts to the amenities of
daily life. It has seen the map of Europe
redrafted and a dozen royal dynasties
toppled from their perches—all this in
less than thirty years. Match this third-
of-a-century’s achievements against those
of the whole preceding hundred years—
railways, steamships, the telegraph, the
telephone, electric light and traction,
photography, anaesthetics and antiseptic
surgery —and you can’t doubt that the
rate of material progress is accelerating.
The nineteenth century was greater than
ours, perhaps, in that it unlocked more
new doors —the roll of its great innova-
tors in science and in the arts is six times
as long as that of any hundred years since
the Golden Age of Greece —but this
present generation makes worthy use of
its heritage. It has acquired, also, some-
thing the nineteenth-century atmosphere
conspicuously lacked —a sense of per-
spective and a keen capacity for admiring
the past.
About 80 per cent, of the matter broad-
cast to-day derives from the nineteenth
century. In music the proportion is
probably higher, though there never was
a period when so many new avenues were
being explored by composers. But par-
ticularly symptomatic of the spirit of this
present age is the very large number of
radio plays that are biographical or his-
torical in basis. This impulse apparently
is not yet very strongly influencing the
stage, though Drinkwater’s “Lincoln” and
Besier’s “Barretts of Wimpole Street” are
outstanding examples. The cinema is
much more representative. Coward’s
“Cavalcade” has set the fashion for the
drama that moves over a long period of
years. “Cimarron” was a characteristic
American excursion in this sort of per-
spective, its background the development
of a city from a mining camp. Many of
the George Arliss pictures have been his-
torical. The lives of such musicians as
Schubert and Beethoven provided material
in the days of the silent film, and are
still drawn upon.
In broadcasting, the retrospective urge
is fully evidenced. The 8.8. C. has sent
forth literally scores of playlets based on
history, and its example has been fol-
lowed in Australia, not so much by the
A.B.C. as by the much-abused B-class
stations. There is a versatile many-voiced
gentleman in one of the Sydney studios
who has in recent months impersonated
almost every great English figure save
Boadicea, and has given scores of people
who thought they had long finished with
the subject a new interest in history.
So there you have it. More than any
preceding age this of ours seems to be
conscious of the past, eager to remember,
to understand the influences that have
built modern civilisation. It is a curious
tendency for a busy, bustling time such
as this, with a new invention appearing
every other day and records of all sorts
being broken with almost monotonous
regularity. Possibly it is an instinctive
protest against being driven too fast. The
world wants time for mental digestion,
and deliberately turns its back on the cur-
rent pageant of progress. The phase per-
haps will soon pass, and future chroniclers
will refer to these times not as progres-
sive (it may be that our 34 years’ record
will look tame in 1950), but as retro-
spective.
SIMPLICITAS.
Country Short-wave Explorations.
A correction has to be made. The
Italian station mentioned last week is
2RO, not SRO. An announcer speaking
perfect English made this clear. 2RO
has been quite the best station recently
between 6 and 8 a.m., coming up to fine
speaker strength after 7 a.m.
Strength of the 8.8. C. stations in the
No. 1 transmission has been poor, and
GSF, in the 19-metre band, has been used
instead of GSB, but is weak until after
9 p.m. DJN and DIB are both weak,
but after 11 p.m. DIN comes up to tre-
mendous strength. When VK3ME is
transmitting, both stations are hopeless
owing to interference, being at the same
frequency. Toward the end of the week
GSE and PHI have been excellent from
11 p.m.; a particularly fine violin recital
was given from GSE on a Monday night.
It has been consistently noted that
GSE is superior to GSD in the same
band.
An American film star spoke from
2RO on December 16, his name’ not
being heard. He was praising Mussolini
and his work. The news session from
DJA next day was most interesting, giv-
ing the German view of the trouble in
the Saar territory, and also a happening
that had not then been reported in the
newspapers (the Captain Justice episode).
The Americans have been poor, with
WBXK, in the 19-metre band, best in the
early morning. The others have all been
very weak.
NIGHTOWL.
Identifying Short-wave Stations.
Although callsigns and wave-lengths are
supplied in international lists, the most
satisfactory means of verification of these
overseas stations is, for the new listener,
the particular identifying sound. The
more important stations have the follow-
ing characteristics:
Daventry, England.—The striking of Big Ben,
Houses of Parliament, London.
Zeesen, Germany.—Musical box playing first
few bars of a German folksong.
FYA, Paris. —The “Marseillaise,” played
through two or three times.
VK2ME, Sydney.—Laugh of the kookaburra.
Moscow stations. —The “Internationale,” played
through two or three rimes ; also, mid-
night chimes from the Kremlin.
Lisbon, Portugal.—Cuckoo calls.
TI4NRH, Guatemala. —Bugle call.
12RO, Italy.—Announcement “Radio Roma-
Napoli.”
Vatican City, Italy.—Announcement “Promo
pronto, Radio Vaticano.”
CNR, Morocco. —Announcement “Radio Rabat
dans Maroc.”
“Bulletin” Test Review.
(Manufacturers’ products considered worthy of
attention are tested and reviewed in this
section .)
“What you’ve never had you never
rniss” is an old saying, but one which is
quite incorrect when applied to motor-
car radio. To-day, the motorist without
radio on board is missing a great deal.
In line with the development of the
home broadcast' receiver, the car receiver
has improved rapidly and is no longer
an experiment. Trouble-free, easily in-
stalled and usable under all conditions, it
is the finest achievement of the radio
engineer. A new production in this line,
the Traveltone, has been tested, and proves
t° he remarkably efficient. It is a six-
valve superhet, housed in a metal case
measuring 12f by 7|- by 8i inches,
Volume and tuning controls are located
on the steering column, and connect to
the receiver by flexible remote control,
The control unit is of moulded bakelite
with aero-type illuminated indicator.
Tuning is easy, even when travelling at
high speed or in traffic, the convenient
position calling for no distraction of the
driver.
The receiver works entirely from the
car accumulator, plate voltages being de-
rived from a vibrator and rectifier. This
vibrator is guaranteed by the makers for
12 months. During the test period no
trace of mechanical noise was found,
even with the ear close to the receiver
and the car at rest. The plate voltage

valves.
unit is built into the receiver case, and
only three holes need be drilled in the
bulkhead of the car to mount the re-
ceiver out of sight behind the dash.
A most noticeable feature whilst test-
ing a Traveltone equipped car in Sydney
streets was the absence of electrical in-
terference, even when following or along-
side tramcars. This indicates very com-
plete shielding. Of noise from the car
ignition system there was no trace. Auto-
matic volume control takes care of in-
equalities in signal strength due to ab-
sorption by steel buildings, etc., and the
capacity type aerial employed showed
no directional effect. One or two dis-
tant stations could be heard whilst tour-
ing Sydney streets in daytime, and at
night the performance is quite on a
par with a six-valve superhet using a
big aerial. Particularly impressive was
the excellent tone quality obtained with
the special large-sized dynamic speaker,
which is generously baffled.
Traveltone car radio is made by Radio
Maintenance Pty., Ltd., Melbourne, and
is marketed in Sydney by Merchant Dis-
tributors, Ltd., 20 steammill-street; the
price, fitted, being £27 10s. If the car is
not fitted with an aerial, this is installed
at a slight extra charge.
Latest in the Trade.
Transposition blocks for short-wave
doublet aerials are something to read
about in overseas publications, but not
yet manufactured in Australia. Syd
Colville, well-known Sydney short-wave
engineer, looking over his stock, had a
brainwave, as the illustration shows.
Old 3in. bakelite dials, when cut with
the necessary slots, make most useful
feeder-line blocks. Mr. Colville has a
number of such dials of genuine bake-
lite, and is offering them at 2d. each
to experimenters. Twelve or 14 of them
will be needed for a 70ft. line. The
address is Colville Wireless Equipment
Co., Rowe-street, Sydney.
What’s What in Radio.
According to “Wireless World,” Eng-
land, radio has done the watchmakers
a very good (urn. Since radio receivers
have been turned out with the loudspeaker
and receiver in the one cabinet, the sale
and repair of watches have risen, and
stayed at a satisfactory level ever since.
In nearly every case of trouble with
watches needing repair magnetisation of
the works is prominent. This is attri-
buted to the fact that, in the process of
tuning a radio receiver, the wrist-watch
comes into close proximity with the
poweful magnetic field of the moving-
coil loudspeaker. If a craze for loud-
speakers separate from sets and on baffle-
boards, fireplace screens, etc., ever returns
the watch repairer will feel the draught.

There have been occasions when the
Australian amateur transmitter has been
criticised as not having contributed very
much to the science of radio communi-
cation. Examination of records, how-
ever, shows that Australians have played
.quite an outstanding part. Apart from
the list that could be tabulated, the latest
is an achievement by G. Pollock
(VK2XU, Belmore, N.S.W.), who has
carried out tests in long-distance tel-
ephony, restricting his power to less than
10 watts. With this power, compara-
tively minute for telephony, he succeeded
in establishing two-way oral com-
munication with amateur stations in
each of the six continents; no mean
feat. VK2XU thus qualifies as a
“W.A.C. ’Phone” man, having “worked
all continents on telephony.”

Latest application of high-frequency
oscillations is to utilise them for de-
stroying insect pests in wheat, fruit or
other crops. The idea is simple. Two
large electrodes forming the plates of a
condenser across the inductance in the
plate circuit of a 100-watt oscillator are
employed. Bags of flour, wheat or other
products are passed between the elec-
trodes, and weevils and other parasites
are killed, whilst the contents of the bags
remain unharmed.

In Soviet Russia 62 different languages
are used in broadcasting from the various
stations. It is claimed that radio has
banished illiteracy, and that the vast
territories of the Soviet Government are
now peopled with radio listeners who,
by broadcast lessons, have taught them-
selves to read and write.
* * * ♦
The last word in radio receivers would
appear to be a massive all-wave affair
in a big and very expensive cabinet and
with a “high-fidelity” audio channel, plus,
of course, a turntable, pickup and pigeon-
holes for records. An English manu-
facturer has gone one better, and turned
out what is termed the “Vivagram.” This
has all the desirable features mentioned,
but contains in addition a complete talkie
outfit. The screen is an integral part of
the structure, and folds back into the top
of the cabinet when not in use. All we
need now is for somebody to turn put
this kind of home entertainer, but with
the addition of television and, possibly,
a complete amateur transmitting and re-
ceiving station in the same cabinet.
Casual Comment.
Further pollution of the air is probable
if the very newest “musical” cult gets a
hold in America. Sundry vocalists are
bidding for big prizes by threatening the
supremacy of the crooner. They appro-
priately term themselves “moaners,” and
outcroon the crooner in imitations of
a run-over dog so realistically that they
plunge the audience into sympathetic
tears. Radio tunes will yet have to be
subjected to the critical ear of Creswell
O’Reilly if Australia wishes to turn on
the radio without fear of nausea.
* * * *
An American broadcasting station,
WHN, has hit upon a novel idea.
Would-be broadcast performers are
permitted to perform before the micro-
phone with the station on the air; not
just “auditioning.” In the studio is a
quick-decision gentleman equipped with
a gong. After introducing an aspirant
he listens to the opening portion, and if
he considers it unsuitable boom goes the
gong. Another competitor starts in, and
so it goes on with a running fire of caus-
tic comment from the gong-person. It is
reported that the competitors put up with
it for the sake of the publicity, and that
listeners laugh and rely upon the gong.
That gong idea could be well applied in
some of our own stations, but the caustic
comment business might provoke retorts
in spicy Australian on the part of the
sufferers, and the control engineer would
need to be speedy with his fader.

Expert Latinists who listened to the
Pope’s broadcast recently were able to
to pick up only a word here and there,
though the enunciation was distinct and
the reception excellent. This was not
wholly due to the church Latin being a
variant from the classical article taught
in schools and universities ; it was that
the Pope speaks Latin with an Italian
accent, while the local Latinist speaks it
—if at all —with an English one. English-
speaking priests often find it difficult to
converse in the church’s tongue with
foreign priests owing to the different pro-
nunciation of words which should be,
and are supposed to be, standardised.
The Q. and A. Column.
Which is the higher degree in radio, M.I.R.E.
( Amt .) or M.I.R.E. ( U.S.A .) ?— 199.
There is really no difference, with the ex-
ception that the American institution is longer
established. The standards required for mem-
bership of the Australian institution are equally
high, and such membership is of most im-
portance to engineers in this country.


SPORTING
NOTIONS
Under the Whip
Horses from Queensland made a great
effort to bring off the Villiers-Summer
Cup double at Randwick. Bachian (16
to 1) did his part in the Villiers, giving
a sterling exhibition of gameness when
tackled by the favorite, Turbine, after
having led most of the way. Dermid
was a fast-finishing third. Knox, in
choosing to ride Bachian in preference
to a better-fancied candidate, showed un-
commonly good judgment for a jockey.
But Brown Force (7 to 2) just failed in
the Summer Cup; weight told at the
finish, and he was beaten a head by
Dark Chief (10 to 1), with the favorite,
Magnitas, a fair third. Including 21b.
overweight, carried in order that Pike
might ride the Queenslander, there was
221 b. between first and second. Dark
Chief, who is owned by Hugh Denison,
the newspaper knight, is a one-pace
horse, but can maintain his one pace
over a considerable distance. Lightfoot,
his jockey, is Pike’s nephew.
H: * * *
Ethics had a stiff task in the Viceroy’s
Cup, but accomplished it triumphantly,
beating Complet, owned by the Viceroy
(Lord Willingdon) himself, by a neck,
with Pougatchev, from the Maharajah of
Kashmir’s stable, third. It is a 14-furlong
race, and the Australian horse’s time was
3min. 0 4-ssec. An odds-on favorite,
he is trained by Alec Higgins and
was ridden by E. J. Morris; only
the owner, A. C. Ardeshir, is not
a Commonwealth product. It was
16 years since an Australian horse had
won the Viceroy’s Cup. That neddy was
Wandin, who, regarded as a sprinter in
his own country (he won the Oakleigh
Plate for C. L. Macdonald, owner and
trainer of Wakeful and Revenue, in 19061,
developed staying power in India, as
Ethics has done. Ethics was just a miler
in Sydney.

Jack Holt served up two warm favor-
ites at Caulfield on Boxing Day, but each
failed. Press Gang was beaten into third
place in the Malvern Handicap; Heros
was practically left at the post in the
Christmas Handicap, and, of course, did
not figure in the finish. Press Gang be-
longs to Fred Craig, who has not had
much luck on the turf since he captured
the Melbourne Cup of 1923 with Bitalli.
Chief riding for Holt’s stable at present
is entrusted to Skidmore. It was the
weight (9st. 81b.) that stopped Press
Gang. He got almost on terms with the
pacemaker. Burlesque, after entering the
straight, but could not fight on satisfac-
torily. Getting a lucky run on the rails,
Epigram made a dead-heat with Bur-
lesque in the last stride.
After passing the post Burlesque col-
lided with another horse and unseated
Dewhurst. The boy was assisted back
into the saddle by a racecourse attendant.
On a protest being lodged by the rider
of Epigram, some spectators assumed
that the objection was on technical
grounds, but it proved to be for
alleged interference. The “stipes” wasted
no time in dismissing it. Epigram and
Burlesque were solidly supported. Bur-
lesque is proving a money-spinner since
he was leased by Norman Robinson to
Gerald Coffey.
The Christmas Handicap went to
Melason, a gelding bred and owned by
E. Y. Shiel. Taking charge a long way
from home, Melason lasted long enough
to defeat the fast-finishing Calulu King
by a neck.
* * * *
Johnnie Jason, now well down in the
weights, ran a pretty good race in the
A.J.C. Holiday Handicap. It was his
first glimpse of form since he downed
Veilmond at w.f.a. in the Warwick
Stakes in 1932. He won the Sydney Cup
that year, and perhaps was put into
training again too soon. He had had a
very strenuous time as a three-year-old.

Capris had a runaway win in the
Highweight Handicap at Randwick, and
is now in high favor for the Adrian
Knox Stakes, The chestnut filly is
owned by Emanuel, a Maorilander, who
brought Deputy Ruler to Australia,
and was fortunate enough to get rid of
him at a great price.

Sydney’s most unlucky two-year-old is
Silver Rose. She ran second to Lady
Primrose in the Gimcrack Stakes, second
to Allegiance at Rosehill, third to Sally
Instep in the Culloden Stakes, second to
Homer in the December Nursery and a
close fourth to Homer in the December
Stakes. She is raced and trained by
R. C. Stanton, of Rosehill.

Tom Nieriker, who prepares the
Magpie filly Urunalong, a sister to the
Australian Cup winner Carry On, had a
boisterous reception from his brother-
trainers after the filly’s success in the
Summer Nursery at Randwick. A
native of Gunnedah, he is the oldest
active trainer at headquarters. He has
turned 70.
* * * *
Chatham, still at Fred Williams’s
Randwick stable, has been blistered, and
the job is to be done again. The
great miler is not to go to Melbourne,
but will be got ready for Sydney events
in the autumn; if he fails to stand a
preparation he will be retired to the stud.

Pastoralist Ernest Lee Steere, who had
Eurythmic, Maple, Second Wind and
other good ones, is again the owner of
about the best horse in Westralia —up to
a mile and a quarter, anyway—in Cap-
paris, a four-year-old bay mare by Fern-
kloof —Lady Capertee. Following up a
victory at Canning Park, Capparis
downed the hot favorite, Gordon’s Leap,
in the Perth Stakes, w.f.a., on the open-
ing day of the W.A.T.C. annual meeting.
Cueesun (Australian Sun —Cue), winner
of the last Perth Cup and favorite for the
next, was a good third. The Derby was
only an exercise gallop for Hyperion (2
to 1 on). He had four opponents.

Australian-bred sires were well in the
picture on Boxing Day, though not at
Randwick, where their progeny were
few and poor. Spearfelt, Rivoli, Harvest
King, Isle of Arran, Blackadder, Wind-
bag, King of Mirth and Stand By were
all represented by winners—Spearfelt by
two (Green Felt and Amberfelt) at Eagle
Farm. King of Mirth, who has been
getting a lot of fair horses in South Aus.,
is the sire of Royal Rest, who captured
the Cheltenham Stakes at the Port Adel-
aide club’s meeting. Isle of Arran’s off-
spring was Isle of Astur, who, after
shaping consistently but unluckily in
Melbourne, landed a good race, the
Hopetoun Handicap, for Temby at Caul-
field. Temby raced both Isle of Arran
and Isle of Astur in Perth.

M.Q. (and Rafferty) Rules
Apart from Carroll, Palmer and Hen-
neberry, Australian boxing form is poor.
Claude Varner, an American feather-
weight, by no means in the first flight,
gave 71b. and a beating to Herb Bishop,
our “lightweight champion,” at Sydney
Stadium on Wednesday night. Almost
before the mill was a minute old, a wild
right swing upset Bishop for “six.” After
that the “champion” held often, and was
repeatedly cautioned. He let Varner do
all the offensive work, and the Ameri-
can’s mauling—it could scarcely be
called boxing—gained him a decision at
the end of 15 rounds. In the eighth, on
one of the rare occasions on which he
tried to take advantage of his superior
weight and apply what he had been
taught, Bishop knocked Varner on all
fours ; but he closed up again when the
lighter man continued his crowding
tactics.
Racquet and Bawl
“Rev. Knucklebone”: Australia came
out well in the triangular international
tennis match in Sydney, winning by 10
rubbers, 22 sets and 155 games to Bri-
tain’s score of 3-10-126 and France’s
2-7-108. Admirers of Crawford and
McGrath already forecast victory in next
year’s Davis Cup series, the fact that
neither of their heroes lost a match hav-
ing gone to their heads. It is early yet
to whoop. The Frenchmen had hardly
found their land legs, while Perry was
for the time being gone to the pack.
There may be a different story in the
big Melbourne tourney with its five-set
matches.
The N.S.W.L.T.A. insured against rain
be tween fcer tain hours on the first day, but,
although the courts were washed out and
the matches postponed, it didn’t collect.
Later people dropped to the fact that
players were not greatly interested, and
there was a mere handful of watchers on
the last day.

racquets continue to appear. The
Bulletin told of one, manufactured in
Australia, with fluid quicksilver inside the
handle ; an English lawsuit has disclosed
another. The handle of this forks just
above the grip, the loop thus formed
enclosing the head of the racquet, which
is of the ordinary oval type. Greater
driving power and resiliency are claimed
for the gadget, which, according to press'
photographs, is appearing on the courts.
* * * *
“Hesketh Park”: The first profes-
sional tennis tourney held in England has
been such a success that another is to be
held; Southport, which launched the
first £lOOO golf tourney, is organising the
show. Tilden has announced that the
professional programme for the future
includes international championships,
to be played in turn in England, France,
Germany and America. Bill also pro-
phesies that ere long the tennis amateur
lamb and professional lion will lie down
in amity together. William didn’t men-
tion how one is to be distinguished from
the other.
“Duckwing”: If it were written of a
man to-day that “he was eminently suc-
cessful on the sod” there would be con-
siderable guessing. I have come across the
phrase in a eulogy of the Earl of Derby
who founded the famous race. It has
nothing to do with the turf, however,
but refers to the sodded floors of the
pits in which the ancient and honorable
sport of cocking was carried on before
the bluest blood in Britain, the earl be-
ing a notable cocker. The panegyric,
which is a chapter of an old book on
British sports, ends on a tearful note.
So wasted was the earl by illness that in
his closing days he was “compelled to
have the cocks brought into his drawing-
room whenever he desired to watch a
main.”
* * * *
“The Gaffer”: Tolan may be engaged
as a coach by the M.L. Athletic Associa-
tion, feelers having been thrown out
when he was passing through Auckland.
The negro is said to have been impressed
with the idea, and there is no reason why
a job of the sort would not be welcomed.
As The Bulletin told Austin Robertson
when he made his barren trip to the
U.S.A. as Winooka’s stable-mate, there
is no professional pedestrianism there.
Apart from coaching, Tolan would be
eligible for professional events in M.L.
and for the Stawell Gift and other still
worth-while handicaps in Australia
* * * *
“G. Trotter”: An Australian handball
carnival is opening in Melbourne. The
players all follow the rules of the ancient
Irish game, the court being enclosed by
three walls. Much faster and more at-
tractive to both players and spectators is
the American game, played from all four
walls like squash racquets —a game with
which it is practically identical, save that
the ball is struck with the palm of the
hand instead of a racquet. Five years
ago I witnessed the final of the Califor-
nian championship at Los Angeles
Athletic Club, the competitors stripped to
their trunks and finishing dead to the
world. Even the public bodies there cater
for the handballers. There are splen-
didly equipped courts at San Francisco
available for anybody who chooses to
come along. The only catch is that yon
have to be there early to have any chance
of a game.
* * *
“Shrewsbury”: With the end of the
British athletic season, the usual wail
has been going up as to the folly of allow-
ing Rhodes scholars from all over the
world to compete in the inter-University
sports, it being claimed that Cambridge
athletes are thus placed at an enormous
disadvantage. One amateur statistician,
however, has quoted figures to show that
without the assistance of the Rhodes
scheme Cambridge has done quite well
out of overseas athletes. In the past 30'
years, while Oxford with the assistance
of Rhodes recruits has scored 50 vic-
tories, the Light Blues, depending on
casual enlistments, have had 20 wins—
by no means a disproportionate share.
* * * *
“Whizz”: Malcolm Campbell has,
after all, decided to make Daytona
Beach the convincing ground for another
attempt on his own speed record, and*
one can only hope he will win through
all right. The beach is far too short for
recent speeds, and in his last spin he was
perilously near disaster a couple of times.
In addition to a threatened American
competitor, an English rival is talking of
trying his luck, also at Daytona. This
is Fred Dixon, a racing professional, who
now owns Kaye Don’s Silver Bullet.
Dixon will give his car a trial on the ill-
omened Pendine Sands in Wales before
going to America.

Frank Bullock, who, after winning the
Melbourne Cup of 1905 on Blue Spec,
made a great name for himself as a
jockey in England and on the Continent,
is on a holiday visit to the land of his
birth. Bullock did not succeed as an
owner-trainer in Victoria, and that cir-
cumstance forced him into going abroad
again. Rich sportsmen patronised him
in France, where Frank turned out many
winners of valuable races ; but he has
broken up his establishment in the
neighborhood of Paris, and intends
settling in England. There is no more
likeable fellow than Bullock, and the sup-
port of which he is assured from English
owners may enable him to eclipse
Norman Scobie, another Victorian, as
a trainer. Bullock married a sister of
Bob Lewis, the veteran Melbourne
jockey. Her death, which occurred not
so long ago, was a great blow to husband
and brother.
* * * *
Holt practically laid the foundations of
his career as trainer by winning the
V.R.C. Standish Handicap of 1911 with
Carette, a mare held on lease from the
late Sam Mackay, of Westralia. Holt
subsequently captured the race for C. B.
Kellow with Blue Cross, for Lady Strad-
broke with Trice and for J. M. Niall
with Umbertana. This year he nomi-
nated three horses —Heros, Press Gang
and Some Hero. They were placed at
the head of the weights, with 9st. 51b.,
9st. 31b. and Bst. 121 b. respectively. Holt
nominated only Picatus for the Bagot
Handicap. Picatus has been hard to
train, and needs frequent relaxations
from work.
* * * *
Tom Woodcock, who took Phar Lap
to the U.S.A., is doing well in Melbourne
as private trainer to P. G. Hay, the
Richmond brewer. Hay owns many
racehorses, and patronises several
trainers, the latest man to obtain a
measure of his support being L. J. Hynes,
who is getting a team together at Glen-
huntly, while still carrying on as a cross-
country horseman. Woodcock is in-
stalled at the delicensed Sandown Park,
of which Hay is tenant. Among the gal-
lopers in work there are four of the
progeny of Fourth Hand, the stallion im-
ported by Lord
Somers for racing
purposes; one of
these. My Partner,
was victorious in the
Cranbourne Silver
Cup. He belongs to
Mrs. Hay, who cap-
tured a Mornington
Cup with Lady Ken-
trel. Fourth Hand is
far from a sure foal-
getter —unfortunately,
for he undoubtedly
transmits galloping
ability.
* * *
There are too many
racecourses in Syd-
ney, and the Govern-
ment had the oppor-
tunity of reducing the number by
refusing to extend the lease of Kensing-
ton, which is Crown land. Its mild But-
tenshaw, however, agreed to renew the
lease for seven years from the end of
1935. He is exacting novel conditions.
The lessee, Kensington Recreation
Grounds, will have to make part of the
course available to amateur sporting
bodies for the bare cost of maintenance,
and must within two years spend £2700
on the construction of a 200-yard foot-
racing track, four tennis courts and three
cricket and football grounds. First pre-
ference is to be given to girls and school-
children.
* * * *
Excellent dividends were declared by
the Randwick 10s. totes at the Christmas
meetings: £l7 9s. s.o. and £7 4s. place
on Nita S. in a division of the Novice
; £ll 7s. and £3 9s. on Mag-
Ihitas in the Holiday Handicap ; £22 11s.
6d. and £5 12s. 6d. on Dark Son in a
division of the Trial Handicap, The
Leger (55.) machine returned £l4 17s. on
Nita S. and £l5 10s. 6d. on Dark Son.
In each case —though 9 p.c, of the pool
had first to be deducted for the Govern-
ment and p.c. and fractions of six-
pences for the club, which pays the tote
co. and operators—they were much
greater than the prices offered by the
bookmakers. If the Government were
content with a fair cut (4| p.c. or 5 p.c.)
and were alive to the possibilities of
tote punting, every form of which should
be catered for, it wouldn’t have to bewail
the decline in revenue from racing or
the cost of policing the s.p. fraternity ;
neither would it have to vex its brains
about the proper impost to be placed on
course bookmakers. In fair competition
the machine would hold its own with the
man, licensed or unlicensed.

The Spencer Bruntons thought they
had a Derby colt in Gladswood, who,
after his third in the Chelmsford Stakes
and second in the Rosehill Guineas, was
a sad disappointment. Homer may com-
pensate the family next season ; his Rand-
wick victories—in the December Nursery
and the December Stakes—were most
impressive. In each race he demon-
strated that a colt of the cut-and-
come-again sort; challenge after chal-
lenge he beat off. And the second five
furlongs he ran in Imin. Homer is a
chestnut built for heavy weather, by im-
ported Iliad out of Quadrilateral.
Ins and Outs
Darling (106) and Bromley (102) added
to the O’Brien and Rigg centuries in
Victoria’s first innings against N. S.
Wales at Melbourne. Brown (71) and
Fingleton (65) started well for N. S.
Wales, but none of the others did much,
and they were all out for 289 —267 be-
hind. Fleetwood-Smith got 6 for 107.
He was again on the spot in the second
innings. Kippax made 52 —it gave him
“You didn’t bring in Miss Brighteyes like this!”
his 6000 in Shield cricket— Chipperfield
84, Oldfield 63 and White 52; total 307.
Fleetwood-Smith took 5 for 121 —11 for
228 in the match is splendid going. Vic-
toria lost one wicket in finishing it off.
* * * *
In Adelaide Queensland, batting first,
put on 430 ; Christy 80, Levy 90 and
Oxenham 74. It then looked a safe
wager for another win over South Aus.,
but Richardson, with Nitschke (116)
as a partner, shattered its hopes. The
first wicket fell at 255, the fourth at 589 ;
Richardson closed at 664 for 7, made
in 520 minutes. The captain’s 185 took
his Shield total to 6000 a day ahead of
Kippax, and Lonergan and Badcock, both
137, put up a record for the State’s third
wicket. Grimmett on the fourth day was
too much for the Bananalanders. Tal-
lon hit up 86 in 81 minutes, and Andrews
obliged with 68, but the total was only
249. Grimmett finished with 16 wickets
for 289, and has taken over 50 wickets
in five matches this season. South' Aus-
tralia by eight wickets.
Victoria (two matches) heads the
Shield table with 10 points. N.S.W.
(three) has 10, too, and Queensland
(three) and South Australia (four) are
five each.
* * * *
“ ’Badian”: Test matches are “in” again,
but, mercifully, a long way off. There
is to be one between England and the
West Indians at Trinidad on January 7.
Wyatt is skipper of England, and his
team is a strong one, though lacking
Walters, who did so well as opening bats-
man against Australia. The Indies will
be minus Constantine for this match, the
mercurial darky being at present revelling
in Hind with Rajahs and all that sort.
He is due back in the land of the guava
and turtle early in the New Year.
* * * *
“Carrie the Cashier”: The girl
cricketers have set a wholesome example
to their male contemporaries in other
ways than the bright, carefree cricket
they have been showing us. The English
lasses’ match with N.S.W. left the cash-
box £270 to the good—practically the
entire takings. It was made possible
by the collection of the N.S.W. cricket-
ines of £2OO among themselves before
the arrival of the visitors. Imagine the
bellow of wrath if our 'pampered men
players were asked to throw into the hat
to meet preliminary expenses before the
arrival of an English team!
* * * *
“Susie Swattit”: People who prate
about the difficulties confronting the
organisers of Test-match cricket have
no conception of the troubles which
have to be overcome by the con-
trollers of the games between the
Australian and English girls. Take
the match at Brisbane. At the last
minute the Australian heads decided to
adopt new costumes for the home side,
skirts being abolished in favor of
divided skirts. Harold Heydon, secretary
of the N.S.W. association —no, Miss
Peden it was —was rushed up to Bris-
bane with 12 of the new costumes, which
had been tacked together at the last
moment, with little time left for trying
on and fitting. What would have hap-
pened had the perspiring emissary arrived
too late and left the girls positively with-
out a thing to wear? Possibly the match
would have been abandoned.
The Nineteenth Hole
“Hasbeen”: Jacobus, president of the
Yankee professional golfers, predicts that
members of the team recently in Aus-
tralia will be among the leaders of the
game in the near future. Laffoon, Shute,
Craig Wood and Runyan come in for
special mention. Hagen Jacobus regards
as “burnt out.” Surprising to Australians
is a scathing indictment of Sarazen, who
is referred to as suffering “a sharp de*-
cline in his golfing stock”:
Sarazen lost his competitive hardness
through haphazard exhibition matches in
England, South America and Australia.
His type of game, with its untrustworthy
interlocking grip, requires constant practice
to keep it up to the highest standard.
With its low factor of safety, his swing is
more likely to get out of groove than the
swings of other notable players.
Well, there is some consolation for the
rabbits in reflecting that even Jove nods.
* * * *
“Hoylake”: An English police-court
case has been responsible for some revela-
tions interesting to golfers and others.
Nine sturdy fellows were lugged up for
drawing unemployment benefit while
earning good money—as much as £6
a week in one case —as caddies. The
prosecuting official said the trick was
being worked all over Britain, and, owing
to the special conditions, was almost
impossible to stop. Possibly the same
joke is being tried in this country, but
it would be on a smaller scale. There
are not many Australian caddies entitled
to draw the dole. In Britain the adult
caddie is the rule rather than the excep-
tion, many men making caddying their
lifelong trade.
Miscellaneous
“Mudlark”: Isn’t it about time the
N.S.W. swimming heads found a better
venue for their swimming championships
than the Domain baths, probably the
most ridiculous swimming-pool for cham-
pionship purposes in the world? When
the State title over 220 yards is contested
on January 5 it will have to be in laps of
73 1-3 yards, because the low tide won’t
leave room for 110-yard laps. This change
is against local and international rules,
which state that all championships must
be swum over courses complying with in-
ternational regulations. The only point
in the Domain’s favor is its accessibility,
which means large attendances.
* ♦ * *
“Spinnaker”: The America’s Cup fiasco
has revived U.S.A. feeling against the New
York Yacht Club, which long ago arro-
gated to itself the conduct of the inter-
national races. The N.Y. club travels in
haughty isolation; it refuses to join the
International Yacht Racing Union, which
governs the sport in 30 countries, and has
a different set of rules. All other Ameri-
can clubs, with those in Canada, belong
to the I.Y.R. body, the section being
styled the North American Y.R.U. The
latter suggests giving the N.Y. crowd the
go-by and starting a new international
race for 12-metre yachts in which any
country may compete, the first contest
to be in American waters in 1935. Brit-
ish yachtsmen are in favor of the new
race, though they would like the first to
be on th'eir side as part of King George’s
jubilee celebrations.
* * * *
“M.G.”: Searches to account for the
wonderful success of the London rowers
has led to their use of swivel rowlocks
being put forward as the reason, with
A. J. Shepherd, an old-time Vic, oars-
man, as the foremost protagonist. The
idea is not new. Very many years ago,
when I rowed with the Yarra Yarra club,
a handful of us barracked strongly for
the swivel rowlock. It seemed ridiculous
that swivels should be universally used
for sculling and taboo for rowing. Shep-
herd was at that time a member of the
Banks club, and put the case strongly;
but we failed to shift the conservatives.
Now the success of the Londoners may
wake oarsmen up to experiment.

The annual Rugby match between
Oxford and Cambridge saw the Light
Blues break a six years’ hoodoo by win-
ning 29-4. Cambridge crossed the Ox-
ford line six times, the Dark Blues having
a dropped goal for their only score. One
Maorilander, Cooper, figured in the
losing side, but no Australian, half-back
Jan McShane, of Sydney, being an absen-
tee. The winning margin is the largest
ever recorded in these matches.

Company Law Reform
Legislation passed in South Australia
and to be passed in N. S. Wales and Vic-
toria promises to effect much-needed
reforms in company promotion and
practice. The measure introduced by L.
O. Martin, the N.S.W. Minister of Jus-
tice, provides, among other things, for
the formation of proprietary cos. and
for features urged in The Bulletin
from time to time.
Shareholders will be entitled to annual
accounts, and auditing is made com-
pulsory. Fixed assets must be distin-
guished from floating assets; how
profits or losses of subsidiary cos. have
been treated must be disclosed; two
directors must sign the balance sheet;
the books must' at all times be open to
inspection by the directors ; commission
on sale of shares is limited to 10 p.c, ;
there must be regular shareholders’ meet-
ings.
Part 13 of the bill is devoted to re-
strictions on sale of shares. The mini-
mum subscription on which the co. may
go to allotment must be stated. A copy
of every prospectus other than that
issued to existing shareholders must be
filed with the Registrar-General. Cer-
tain documents offering shares will be
deemed to be prospectuses. An applica-
tion form for shares must not be issued
separately from the prospectus.
Section 343 says “A person shall not
go from house to house or from place to
place offering shares for subscription or
purchase to the public.” The English
Act provides only against “house-to-
house” canvassing; so the N. S. Wales
measure is more drastic. Offers by letter
are also regulated. The draftsmen of
the English law on which the bill is
based must have been acquainted
with the demoralising effect of type
display; anyway, the startling black
and italic lines so familiar to go-
getters’ victims mustn’t be interspersed
with sober roman any more. In offers
by letter or circular to prospective
shareholders in new floats all type must
be the same size, and the bill, though not
in so many words, rules out quotations
from Shakspeare, such as that about the
tide in the affairs of men leading on to
fortune. The only flourishes apparently
left to the canvasser by letter are ex-
clamation marks.
One omission is that the bill does
not provide for the filing of a copy
of every company’s balance sheet with
the Registrar-General; life-policyholders,
forestry-bondholders and creditors gener-
ally would in this way be granted a pro-
tection they are entitled to. Also, the
measure doesn’t specifically touch on
“bond cos.”
Still, taken by and large, it is a good
bill. The N. S. Wales Parliament has at
last before it the framework of a modern
and effective method of company con-
trol. If the recommendations of L. A.
Cleveland and Wallace Ross are em-
bodied in the bill to which Attorney-
General Macfarlan is committed, Vic-
toria will have a good Companies Act
too ; go-getting in all its forms will be-
come perilous to the go-getter.
Australian-made motor bodies are ex-
ported to the Dutch East Indies; Aus-
tralian-made agricultural implements to
S’Africa and Argentina—also to Eng-
land, lately, in a small way. Now Broken
Hill Prop, has received a £lOO,OOO order
from India for pig iron. Rather a knock
for the theory that there is no chance for
an export trade in anything but “primary
produce.”
* * * *
I. C. Litchfield, voluntary liquidator to
Allied Glass Manufacturers, has received
the Court’s sanction to carry on the busi-
ness until April 30 next. This is the co,
which was to sell out to Atlas Glass, the
prospectus of which was withdrawn a
couple of months back and application
moneys refunded. The Allied Co. was
formed last April, subscribed capital
being £15,000; the winding-up resolu-
tion was passed on Nov, 30. Secured
creditors amount to £2500, and unsecured
ditto to £6500. Partly manufactured
stock, now almost worthless, could be
made, in the liquidator’s opinion, worth
£2500 with an expenditure of £5OO. Other
stock when processed would be worth
£l5OO. Many of the employees were
shareholders, and to them large sums
are owing in wages.
N. S. Wales’s mineral yield for 1934 has
been valued at £9,900,000, an increase of
£1,000,000 over 1933, the more remark-
able since gold (£291,000) accounts for
only £42,000 of the increase. Coal is
still the most important item at
£4,690,000, followed by Broken Hill lead
and zinc concentrates at £2,200,000. Tin-
mining has also revived. As an indica-
tion of the recovery in building activity
cement production figures are interesting.
•The State’s outturn for the year was
231,000 tons, as against 177,000 tons in
1933.
* * * *
Even King Coal felt a little better dur-
ing 1934, due almost entirely to increased
local manufactures. Output on the New-
castle and Maitland fields is tentatively
put at 4,000,000 tons, as against 3,516,120
tons last year. The export trade, largely
lost during the 1929 strike, has shown
little improvement in the difficult years
si nee.
* * * *
Yarn- and textile-making machinery
imported during the last July-Oct. period
"'Ow’ll next Chewsd’y week do y', missus?”
showed an increase of £34,000 (at
£108,000) over the same period of 1933.
The increase in all such machinery im-
ports reflects activity in some Australian
secondary industry or other.
* * * *
Farmers topped the bankruptcy lists
during 1933-4. There were 433 of them
among 2130 who went under, and 307
came from the poorer wheat lands of
S.A. Other classes included 142 grocers,
115 merchants and 124 laborers.
* * * *
Commonwealth Statistician McPhee’s
analysis of the cost of food and groceries
for the six capitals during November
shows an average drop of 1.5 p.c. In
N. S. Wales the fall has been 1.2 p.c.,
Vic. 2.4 p.c., Queensland 1.6 p.c. and
Westralia 0.4 p.c. South Aus. shows an
increase of 1.3 p.c., while the Speck’s
figure is unchanged. Sydney still has
the highest food costs with 29.6 p.c.
above 1914 levels, followed by Brisbane
and Melbourne with 22.8 and 22.5 p.c.
respectively.
* * * *
N.S.W. Government will be obliged
to compensate the Berrima Electric
Power Co. for “any money actually ex-
pended in respect of the carrying out,
during the period July 1 to December 12,
of any construction, establishment or ex-
tension.” Bowral Council favored the
co.’s offer to supply the district with elec-
tricity. The Government insists on the
supply coming from its Port Kembla
plant.
* * * *
In January, 1934, the Sydney wool-
price index was 208, in June 142, in
September, October and November 111.
On December 15 it was down to 108,
compared with an average of 96 in 1932
and 127 in 1933. Although worrying
won’t do any good it’s just as well to
know how we stand.
Only 524,000 bales of wool were
shipped from Australia between June 30
and October 31, against 805,000 bales
last year. The return was £7,504,530
compared with £14,344,380.
* * * *
The new N. S. Wales Companies Bill,
as mentioned elsewhere, follows the Eng-
lish Act. Commercial and legal men should
therefore have precedents laid down
in English test and other cases as a guide
—free of charge. In a country where
abstruse taxation Acts and hastily-
drafted financial-emergency legislation
have driven the average businessman
almost crazy, a tried and tested Corn-
panics Act should be welcome as rain
at Thargomindah.
* * * *
Sydney retailers report the best Christ-
mas since 1929. Though cheaper lines
sold readily there was more inquiry for
quality goods; the demand for furniture
and suits of clothes was marked.
* * * *
As part of its effort to save its vine-
yards France is encouraging the drink-
ing of grape-juice. Australia might take
the tip. Grape-juice is already sold here,
but is prepared in such a way as to make
it as expensive as the cheaper wines.
With a machine into which grapes could
be thrown and crushed ready to serve to
customers, it should be possible to retail
grape-juice at threepence a glass, and if
that were done there should be through-
out the Commonwealth a sale sufficiently
large to relieve vignerons of a lot of
their worries.

Because Russia has been an unreliable
debtor in the past Britain has insisted
on satisfactory credit arrangements for
goods supplied to the Soviet. In view
of the high cost of this form of finance
the U.S.S.R. has now decided to pay
cash on the nail for British goods. But
as ready cash is something which Russia
is not overburdened with,
British exports in that direc-
tion are expected to drop
considerably.

Since repeal U.S.A. hasn’t
gone as wet —legally—as the
Treasury hoped. The nation
is drinking about a third of
the annual consumption in
pre-Pussyfoot days. Retail
prices, owing to import duties
and excise, are still “exces-
sively high,” most of the
booze is “of doubtful
quality,” and officials are of
the opinion that bootlegging
is still a thriving industry.
In its endeavors to protect
revenue the Government has
confiscated 11,000 illicit stills.

Japan has just had its biggest year of
external trade to date. Though the trade
balance showed a slight debit it was an
improvement, and no doubt was well
covered by invisible exports. But
America and the British Empire (Aus-
tralia is prominent) buy a lot less from
the Japanese than they sell to them. Ex-
ports of cotton goods last year exceeded
those of silk for the first time ; they are
now a big factor in Japan’s trade, and a
baffling problem to Lancashire. This
huge expansion in the trade of Nippon
overseas has been a development of the
last decade.

“M. Turlutu”: Total catch of edible
fish from Queensland waters for the year
to June 30 last was 4000 tons, valued
at £139,801, an advance of 415 tons
over the previous year. Twenty-eight
fewer boats and 28 fewer fishermen were
licensed than in 1932-33. Only 31 turtles
were taken, compared with 736 in the
previous year. Total output of oysters
was 5817 sacks, valued at £14,604, a de-
crease of 32 p.c. For the slump a scare
in January is blamed; the Brisbane
public became alarmed by reports that
oysters from sewage-polluted waters
were being sold.
* * * *
“E.S.J.”: Things that make me marvel,
as an old fisherman interested in the de-
velopment of what should be a great
industry, is the scandalous waste of first-
rate fish during the mullet season and
lack of demand for the roes. Smoked
mullet roes bring up to 7s. 6d. a pound
in Port Said.
* * * *
“Currugh”: Re goods in shop windows
(B. 5/12/’34). I went into a Melbourne
store to buy a pair of trousers marked in
the window at 10s. 6d. I was told the
line had been increased to 12s. 6d. Dis-,
satisfied with all other qualities shown,
I was about to depart when the assistant
said I could have the things for 10s. 6d.
I haven’t gone back to that shop.
Haggling gives me the feeling that I m
dealing with a rogue and will be cheated
anyhow.

“G.M.”: Richmond (Vic.) Council is
annoyed because a builder given permis-
sion to erect eight flats went ahead full-
steam and erected 10. Seeing that each
of these flats consists of one room only,
the community has a better right to be
annoyed with the Richmond Council. A
building to be occupied by different
households, each provided with one room,
will stand as a glorious monument to
Melbourne’s centenary. The shade ot
John Batman must look down pityingly
as he recalls that they did things better
in his day.

Telegraphic Address: “Austraotel, Sydney.
A WOMAN'A
LETTER
Joy decided not to be too retained on
December 31, so Sydney had a braw,
bricht, moonlicht nicht on New Year’s
Eve. In countless homes in whose blood
the heather and the tartan flow, and in
countless halls and cafes, Hogmanay
dances raged, and the haggis was put to
bed to the wild skirl of pipes. David
Jones’s ballroom was positively prickly
with white heather, for every man and
fair who danced for the benefit of the
Deaf and Dumb and the Blind Institu-
tion was decked with the luck-bringer.
Braw Highlanders in full war paint of
kilts and bagpipes broke in on the merry-
makers at midnight. Between this dance
and the Good Luck Ball at Tate’s (at
th(? Ambassadors’ old address) members
of the Fuller Opera Co. were distributed.
Premier Stevens breathed benevolence
over the State from the microphone at
the Danc-sing Ball in the Town Hall.
The Returned Sailors and Soldiers’
League welcomed 1935 from Mark Foy’s
ballroom ; and on the exclusiveness of
Point Piper the Prince Edward Yacht
Club drank a loving cup with the little
year.
Pittwater was all puffed up about its
regatta this year. Not only was Broken
Bay thick with motor yachts and all the
smaller craft, but its southern arm
warmly cuddled the Newcastle steamer
Gwydir. The Strathnavers and Malolos
don’t have their lordly cruises to them-
selves. The Gwydir determined to break
into this big money, and mapped out a
nice one for herself. Her cruise started
at Sydney; then took in the regatta, and
on Sunday she meandered through the
lower waters of the Hawkesbury and as
far north as Cape Three Points. Aero
Club ’planes, seven of them, helped the
excitement at the Pittwater regatta by
racing through the afternoon from the
Mascot aerodrome to the flagship
Gwydir, lying off Newport and Bayview.
Not only as the Papal Legate, but as
the brother of Mother Margaret Mac-
Rory, who died in 1931, was Cardinal
Macßory welcomed by the pupils of the
Sacred Heart Convent at Rose Bay. It
was a great day for the past pupils, for
the event of the afternoon was the
presentation of a gold memorial key.
This is no ordinary key just ordered from
the jeweller. It is fashioned of gold and
gems which belonged to the ex-students,
and is a replica of the tabernacle key of
his Eminence’s own Armagh Cathedral
(the conspirators in love had had a
duplicate one sent from Ireland). It is six
inches long, of solid gold, and is thickly
set with pearl and sapphire, ruby and
diamond. To go with it was an ex-
quisitely designed and illuminated ad-
dress, the work of artist Pearl Sheldon,
herself a Rose Bayite. The party set out
to be of the garden variety (and there
wasn’t a blade too long, a petal un-
curled), but the spacious drawing-rooms
of the convent were also filled with happy
groups. Papal etiquette was observed in
the frocking. All the women wore sleeves
to the wrist and skirts of decorous
length. However, mantillas were not
compulsory. Mother Macßory was the
founder of the beautiful Sancta Sophia
College for girl students within the Uni-
versity.
The air was cool, the sun shone, so
women went to Randwick in summer
clothes. Some of them, though, wore the
high-crowned felts that are probably more
blithesome in the Tyrol that inspired
their architecture than they were even in
the moderate temperature of Sydney’s
Boxing Day. Anyway, why let your
head thrust forward into autumn while
your body still dallies with summer?
Fringes, too, were worn by some of the
straight-from-Londoners. As there were
only 34,500 present it was comparatively
easy to get a look at the emerald lawns
and gaily-blooming borders. As usual,
mentally a blue ribbon was pinned in the
lapel of the A.J.C. gardener.
This Letter met one *woman who had
gone out with the intention of winning
herself a platinum wristwatch to shame
her husband, who had given her an 80-
guinea refrigerator for a Christmas
present. But she was one of the many
who did not get on to Dark Chief. Betty
Fogarty, from Melbourne, brought wood-
land pinks and browns, and Barbara
Knox’s navy-blues looked smart with
their white patterning and finish of silver-
fox. Mimi Flealy’s shady white hat, with
its borders of tiny
yellow and blue
woodland flowers,
was a winner, as
was Mrs. Ellis
Fielding Io n e s’s
small grey satin
straw. This was
the climax of a
French-grey suit
of crepes warmed
by a roseate chif-
fon blouse. A
large currant - red
hat balanced neatly
on Marjorie Man-
chee’s head, and
her black crepe
frock was trimmed
in the new way
with fine kilting.
Strawberries and
cream had influ-
enced the coloring
of Mrs. Walter
Burfitt’s raiment.
Brown with light-
ning stripes was
worn by Mrs.
Jimmie Burns;
Margaret Burns
was all navy and
white, the front of
her beret showing
a headlight of dia-
men t e. Surgeon
McKelvey’s lady
walked in black-
and-yellow checks,
and wore one of
her favorite wide-
brimmed black
felts ; Mrs. Harry
Budge brought
daughter Eli s e,
who was skyey-
blues from her large hat down. A white
felt hat and blue trimmings added dis-
tinction to Gwen Brown’s Shantung suit.
Strings of the best motor-cars and
diamonds are flashing nightly up towards
Campbell-street. That is not an indica-
tion that our gilt-edged citizens are wal-
lowing in chop-suey. No ; they are hav-
ing an orgy of grand opera, and that is
housed in the New Tivoli, just around the
corner from China in Sydney. “Tann-
hauser” drew all the finest feathers, and
“Die Fledermaus” the gay birds, who
chuckled with delight to find that a man
could get hopelessly tight to really
superior music. Florence Austral, in
turquoise satins, handsome and serene,
and Trixie Tange, beside her, a mop
of red-gold hair and a long green-
plumed fan, were two of the intensely
interested at the Wagner first night. With
them sat John Amadio. Betty and
Heather Baden-Powell, daughters of the
Chief Scout, were seen swallowing a
draught of culture ; so was E. J. Grave-
stock’s Betty.
Youth is greatly in evidence these opera
nights. Philip Game, junior, looks in
with a party of young things occasionally,
and schoolgirls in holiday fluffiness watch
the stage with intent, grave eyes. Mrs.
Norman Lowe brought a young daughter
one night, her black tresses circled with
tiny rosebuds.
Princess Marina has a link with Aus-
tralia in her lady-in-waiting, appointed
by the King last month. Lady Mary
Dorothea Hope, who is already deep in
her arduous job, is a daughter of the
first Marquess of Linlithgow, who was
the first Governor-General of Australia,
That was in 1900. Lady Mary was not
born till some years later.
Here is Pat Farquharson, a Sydney
girl who goes everywhere. Polo and surf-
ing, dancing and tennis claim her atten-
tion in their due seasons. Just now, of
course, it's the surf.
Frills on the frock and fringes on the
forehead is the gospel laid down by a
just-returned-from-London, whose clothes
prove she has shopped neither in Kings-
way nor in Baker-street. But the frills
aren’t the simpering, debutante sort;
they are of the sophisticated cascady
variety. Moire in every shade known to
nature or to art will gladden the tea-
dance and the ballroom by Eastertime ;
and the smartness of a frock in black-
and-white-flecked taffeta sweeping out
to just enough train for dignity, and not
enough for damns, has to be seen to be
believed. Velvet of uncrushable texture
is the season’s fabric for evening coats.
These are sinuously cut and very long—
often slinkily trained. You have to be of a
height to carry them, though, when they
develop cape collars and elaborate
sleeves. Fur capes that hug the shoulders
and reach the waist without flares are
another evening smartness. If you can’t
afford them in ermine or sable (and who
can, unless she debits it to her over-
draft?) try our own Australian bunny
clipped into coney. Have it cut into
bands running round. Evening frocks
are still backless, but when moored by
diamente the shoulder straps are in-
clined to be wider than heretofore.
Metal-woven fabrics are to gleam in
the 1935 frocks for formal wear. Silver
and gold lame will be made into styles
that run to trains and draped backs;
check taffetas will still frivol info
ruchings; and pleatings and diamente
buttons will have an innings. Berets and
pull-ons in velvet will adorn every second
head, while felt hats stabbed somewhere
across the crown with a quill are heavily
tipped for a place ; the high Cossack-look-
ing caps will probably be hard to wear
unless you have a profile and an unlined
brow (outside, of course).
Down with pneumonia in Lewisham
private hospital, Archbishop Kelly has
been putting up a great fight for life. His
illness has evoked a great outburst of
sympathy from members of all denomi-
nations.
Polly Moriarty, niece of the Maxwell
Chisholms, of Merrilla, had the stretch-
ing grounds of that old home on the
Wollondilly River as the setting for her
wedding reception. By benefit of St.
Saviour’s in Goulburn, the bride had be-
come Mrs. Charles L. Thomson; and
then everybody motored back to see her
turn back the tulle and Limerick lace
veils and cut the cake. The late Captain
N. P. Moriarty was the new Mrs. Thom-
son’s father ; the ’groom is a son of the
C. R. Thomsons, of the Bank of N. S.
Wales in Goulburn. Alison Moriarty
and Pat and Janet Chisholm ’maided in
befrilled yellow tulle.
Mary Wells chose Boxing Day for her
wedding. Only a family group went to
St. James’s to cheer by their presence the
entrance and exit of Mary and bride-
groom Ernest Roy Hudson, and there
was a total abstinence of bridal raiment.
The wedding-frock was of softest-blue
matelasse; softly blue was the bride’s
wide hat. Her flowers were a spray of
pink orchids pinned on her frock. Padre
W. Hume welded the twain into one, and
’groom’s brother Cyril was best man.
Mr. and Mrs. Hudson are now honey-
mooning in Melbourne.
There are no small meannesses about
the vice-regal Games. For the opening
night of the opera the management sent
an invitation for a G.H. party of six. The
State Exes, accepted the invitation, but
immediately booked another six seats for
the first night, and seats for every first
night during the season.
Novelist A. P. Herbert, who made
numbers of friends when he was in Aus-
tralia some years ago, recently squired
pretty daughter Crystal into matrimony.
A.P., incidentally, has written a novel
satirising the divorce laws of England
which he calls “Holy Deadlock.” How-
ever, Crystal quite happily took her
chance, and became Mrs. John Sleigh
Pudney at Chiswick Parish Church.
Christmas morning brought no peace
on earth to the son of one rich family.
The youth, who has not yet acquired a
profession of his own, is kept on a pretty
short allowance, and, wanting to make a
hit with one of his girl friends, he de-
cided to take a risk and enter one or two
oddments to his mother’s account in one
of the big shops. He didn’t know what
he wanted, but a managing sales-lady
did, and she sent him away from the
store with a set of the most expensive
chiffon undies —peach-pink in shade, and
0.0.5. in size. He dispatched his gift,
only to receive it back by return of post
with a note that can only be described
as a flea in the ear. Nor was that the
end of it. Mother happened into the
store on Christmas Eve, and the manag-
ing sales-lady gushed to her: “Oh, Mrs.
, didn’t you just adore the peach
chiffon undies John bought for you last
week?” Chiffon! Peach pink! And
she one of the last-ditch diehards of the
red-flannel brigade!

Chatter
It wasn’t a very exciting Boxing Day
meeting at Caulfield, for so many people
were either out of town or else sleeping
off the effects of too much Christmas.
One small girl sat in the grandstand all
the afternoon quite content to hug a
beautifully dressed doll, obviously a
present received the day before. A
large percentage of umbrellas parked in
the cloakroom and lightweight tailored
coats were in the scheme of things for
women’s dressing. Polly Pyke wore a
new type of cream raincoat of synthetic
satin with a surface like fish scales. Her
sister Guelda had seven-eighths of scar-
let rubber cape swinging over her
speckled blue frock. Doris Newman’s
dark-blue dress had a sky-blue motif
inserted in the corsage. Mrs. Rogers
Thomson, in navy patterned with tur-
quoise and wide-brimmed matching mil-
linery, focussed her race glasses from the
level of the committee box. The Con-
nolly girls were among those whose
spirits were undaunted by the weather.
Around Freda’s big white hat was a
wreath of gardenias, and Iris with her
gloves, linen shoes and summery hat re-
peated the dusty-pink color-note of the
background of her floral frock.
Though nearly 30 miles from Mel-
bourne, Frankston has been overwhelmed
by the Scout jamboree. Apart from the
10,000 Scouts in camp the population has
been increased by over 20,000 sightseers.
Not only is the place booked out, but
the foreshores are dotted with tents and
an occasional caravan.
The Scouts have laid themselves out to
give their movement adequate publicity,
and the decorations not only in the camp
but down the streets of Frankston are
a credit to them.
Up to the date of opening the Maori-
landers have made the bravest show.
Maori art lends itself to effective imita-
tion, and these youngsters have certainly
done well with their pahs and council
houses and other Maori appurtenances,
not to mention the mats and the meres
which are used in their hakas. The
Javanese are running the Maorilanders
second, and threaten to come with a final
sprint and head the nations in picturesque
decoration. The Japanese, unfortunately,
have only a couple of representatives, or
they would probably have taken some
beating. The same applies to the
Chinese. But there is a strong contin-
gent from India, and they too are get-
ting busy tricking out the gum-trees with
emblems of their coral strand. Taking
it altogether, the camp is a revelation
of what boys can do when they set their
minds to it—not only in actual manual
labor but in ingenuity of design and
ability of organisation. The jamboree
is the best show in Melbourne to-day.
Lord Baden-Powell believes that we
were put into this world to be happy and
to enjoy its wonders and beauties. The
aim of the Scout movement which he
created in 1907 is to educate boys in
citizenship without class distinctions and
to help them through healthy and happy
comradeship to become fine men. The
world’s Chief Scout must have had one
of the greatest thrills of all his 77 years
in his welcome to Melbourne and the
wonderful success of the jamboree. Lord
and Lady Baden-Powell, with their
daughters, are in residence at The Lodge
—not a palatial mansion, by any means,
but just a simple cottage at the camp.
Lady Baden-Powell, the world’s Chief
Guide, is a woman of high ideals, force-
ful personality, a heap of commonsense
and decided ideas. She sympathises with
and understands young people, and de-
clares that there is just as much good stuff
in the world to-day as ever there was.
But she considers that many lose sight
of the fact that the building up of a
girl’s character is of major importance
to the womanhood of a nation. Too
much time and attention expended on
dress and make-up have created the
aimless and therefore discontented
girl. The Guide movement, which
was created at the time of the war
because there was a need for it, has
penetrated into 48 different countries,
and its membership touches one million.
Its aim is to make a useful citizen of
every young woman, no matter what her
job, and prepare her (Lady Baden-Powell
is very firm on this point) to be a suc-
cessful homemaker.
Heather and Betty Baden-Powell,
though still in their teens, are their
father’s secretaries. The elder girl
can type and transcribe her own
shorthand. Both can remember the
times of trains and engagements ahead,
and can look after luggage without losing
their cheery smiles.
The grasshoppers did not arrive in
Melbourne for Christmas after all. For
weeks they had been making this way
at a pace which looked as if the armies
would converge at a point near the city
in time for an outsize Christmas dinner
in the Botanical Gardens. Many of the
very dirty cars seen about with gauze
over their radiators have come from the
’hopper country and are covered not with
mud but with millions of squashed in-
sects, which are much harder to clean
off. Travellers in sedans listen to a
machine-gun fire on all the windows, but
people in open cars and goggles wish
that the visors worn by the Crusaders
were again in fashion and could be pro-
cured at village shops. There are
rumors that isolated ’hoppers have
been seen at the bay beaches. If the
swarms have such strong social aspira-
tions that they will pass over luscious
feed in Melbourne gardens to follow
society to its summer haunts they will
probably die through indigestion brought
on by tea-tree mixed with crumbs of
caviare sandwiches.
French Scout Commissioner the Comte
de Maigret is accompanied on his visit
to Melbourne’s jamboree by his young
Comtesse, who, in a large summery hat,
here faces a Dickinson-Monteath camera.
The Comtesse is Italian by birth, but has
lived in France since she was 10. Her
hobby, second to scouting (for she is her
husband’s secretary), is yachting. She
skippers her own yacht along the French
coast, among the Channel Islands and
across to England, and also owns a little
racing boat of five metres which is
built to hold only two people. The
Comte and Comtesse, with their small
son and daughter, aged five and six re-
spectively, live in Epernay, Champagne,
and they have a country home on an
island off the coast of Brittany. Though
the Comtesse will have been round the
world after travelling back home through
Panama, she has not yet visited London.
Sharing the responsibilities of M.
Schlemmer and the Comte de Maigret
is M. Lefevre, also a Scout Commis-
sioner ; but as he does not speak English
only people with linguistic accomplish-
ments have so far made his acquaint-
ance. The five French visitors have been
warmly welcomed in Melbourne, for they
are all types of citizens of which any
nation would be proud. In their turn
they have already a genuine feeling of
friendliness for this young democratic
country. Both the Comtesse and
Madame Schlemmer speak highly of Aus-
tralian hospitality and the power which
Australians possess of making foreigners
feel at home, and they say complimentary
things about the manner in which Aus-
tralian women arrange flowers.
There were record entries for the
Camperdown tennis tournament, which
attracted many visitors from Melbourne
as well as from the surrounding dis-
trict. In addition to tennis togs and
racquets, bathing-suits were included in
everybody’s baggage, for the Western
District is plentifully sprinkled with
lakes. The Edward Manifolds, of
Wiridigil, the . A. J. Staughtons, of
Keayang, the C. B. Palmers, of Dal-
vui, and the Edmund Thornleys, of
Gnotuk, were among owners of homes
where every guestroom was occupied,
Newly-engaged pairs Ruth Rogers and
David Pittendrigh, Audrey Poolman and
lan Mann were among those who went
to most of the week’s parties.
The wind-up of the festivities, a ball
at the Oddfellows’ Hall, was secretaried
by Vera Thornley, in a rustling frock of
crisp black organdie. Preceding this
tennis dance were several cocktail and
dinner parties. The following night
Adelaide visitors J. Rymill, L. T. Porter
and J. Sangster poured revivers at the
Leura Hotel for several guests whose
destination later was the Jack Thorntons’
dance.
Here is the wife of M. Schlemmer,
Chief French Scout Commissioner, who
has charge of the French contingent of
Scouts visiting Melbourne for the jam-
boree. M. Schlemmer speaks perfect
English, and Madame has a fluent com-
mand of the language. For many years
the lives of the couple have revolved
round the Scout movement, which is
steadily growing in France. Madame’s
active participation is on the executive
side, but many Frenchwomen have their
own Cub packs, of which they are Wolf
Mothers. Monsieur and Madame
Schlemmer have two sons (the younger is
still at school), who are both Rover
Scouts. Their home is in Paris, and one
of their favorite holiday resorts is a
country estate on the lake of Geneva.
Dickinson-Monteath portrait.
The English women tennis-players are
relieved to be once more on this side of
Bass Strait. Not that they were badly
looked after in Tasmania —on the con-
trary, they admired the scenery and found
everybody most congenial—but they are
bad sailors, and the crossing to Launces-
ton was particularly rough. It takes a
good deal of will-power to play good
tennis immediately on top of severe sea-
sickness, Each of the women players
was presented by a local racquet manu-
facturer with a mirror in the guise of
a miniature racquet. Each mirror is
beautifully made, as perfectly propor-
tioned as a full-size racquet, and has a
sycamore back instead of strings.
Marie and Pat Lansell returned from
abroad to find a thrilling surprise pre-
pared for them in the garden of Den-
dereh, near Bendigo. It’s a swimming-
pool surrounded on three sides by tiled
balustrades, and on the fourth by a
garden where swinging hammocks make
splodges of color as vivid as the flower-
beds. There are rubber cushions on
which sunbathers may acquire the desired
amount of tan —those who prefer to get
browned upon the lilt' of waves may
sail the 70ft. by 40ft. of cleaf green water
upon inflated rubber rafts. Marie and
Pat invited a dozen lads and lasses to
the opening of their pool, where Mrs.
Lansell performed the official ceremony
by diving into the water through strands
of colored streamers. She wore a dusty-
pink swimming suit for her ceremonial
plunge, and a blue knitted ensemble of
coat and slacks for the prelude and
aftermath. While the girls were abroad
Marie won some skating trophies in
Switzerland. Pat was at school for a
considerable portion of her two years
away from home.
Peggy le Plastrier and Brian Breheny
have between them built a speedboat.
Since Peggy was 14 she has wanted one,
but Cecil le Plastrier —as most fathers
would in the circumstances —only laughed
at his daughter’s ardent wish. Now
Peggy, aged 20, has achieved her greatest
ambition. It has taken many months of
hard work —dances and parties faded into
the background for the youthful pair,
who often toiled until 2 a.m. Peggy’s
and her father’s cars have slept under a
tree since the garage became a workshop.
For Christmas Cecil le Plastrier signed
his name to a cheque for the particular
type of expensive engine which the boat-
builders had their eye on. The Miss Peg,
painted Air Force blue and upholstered
with white rubber cushions ornamented
with blue buttons, had a bottle of cham-
pagne broken over her bow at the Le
Plastriers’ home by Mrs. M. A. Breheny.
There were guests at the christening
(which later turned into a dance) who
aired their suspicions that the Miss Peg
might sink as soon as she was launched,
but doubts were laid at rest two days
later when she returned from her fast
trial trip the dryest boat in Williamstown.
Preceded by her first bridesmaid and
followed by the other six attendants, Jill
Ryan walked alone up the long aisle of
St. Patrick’s Cathedral, where her mother,
Mrs. T. J. Ryan, waited to give her into
the safe keeping of Raymond Lambert.
The wedding garment was of beautiful
material, which in some lights glittered
silver and in others became a dim white.
The bride carried lilies, and clouds of
tulle veil were wafted in eddies over
the flowing length of her long train.
The seven ’maids were in white organza,
pencil-striped with silver, their shoulders
swathed with folded berthas and upon
their heads little caps made from
loosely-woven strands of silver cord.
Instead of a hat Mrs. Ryan wore a
halo of finely-pleated ivory tulle, and
she carried camellias and gardenias of
the same deep cream as her satin gown.
Madame Lambert held red roses against
her black frock. At the reception at the
Windsor the bride and ’groom sat with
their parents, the officiating padre, chief
attendant Merna Connell, best man Prof.
Heinze and Mrs. Heinze at a long table
banked with white roses, lilies and silver
leaves. The other ’maids were squired
by the ushers at smaller tables.
Government statists, who have lately
been sunk up to their ears in records
pertaining to births, marriages and deaths,
announce the results of the investiga-
tions. By adding, dividing and juggling
with masses of figures so that each little
decimal is popped into his right cubby-
hole, they disclose the news that, though
the marriage rate is increasing, the birth-
and death-rates will in a few decades be
equal. Many authorities consider this
a serious development, and foresee the
time when Australia will* have halved
its population. But it’s possible that the
people of that distant generation will be
99 p.c. healthy, such is the increasing
importance set upon physical fitness.


SUNDRY
SHOWS
An Old Art
Goes By
In spite of op-
timistic utter-
ances of the legit,
theatre people, it
is a melancholy
fact that their
stage is going. Its death throes are likely
to continue a little longer, but the cold
fact is that to-day the word theatre means
nothing but moving-picture theatre, and
an actor, no longer that haughty fellow
at whom one gazed over the rim of one’s
pewter in a saloon bar, is only a shadow
on the films.
The signs of senile decay—and, after
all, the English theatre is centuries old--
are many, but none so significant as the
growth of. the Little Theatre movement.
This may seem paradoxical; the ac-.
cepted view is that the increasing num-
ber of these havens of ineptitude and
dilettantism is an indication of healthi-
ness, a token that the ideal of the flesh-
and-blood stage is once more taking hold
on the minds of the people. Nothing
could be further from the truth.
The importance of any form of enter-
tainment in a community lies in the mea-
sure of support given by the amusement-
seeking public, A distasteful pill for
the Art Theatre enthusiast to swallow,
but true, nevertheless. The Elizabethan
theatre flourished lustily because the stuff
it purveyed was the strong meat for which
Londoners of all degrees hungered ; the
Restoration dramatists turned out play
after play because the stage was supported
by apprentices and Court gallants, serv-
ing wenches and ladies of the town. Can
this be said of the stage as it is now,
either of the stage proper, served by pro-
fessional actors, or of its parasite, the
Little Theatre, with its anaemic aspira-
tions and arty-crafty hangers-on?
The mob —that is, the people for whom
Shakspeare wrote and Wycherly and Con-
greve penned their wittiest lines—prefers
nowadays to sit in comfort and enjoy a
fare different from that which believers in
the Art of the Theatre would thrust
before it.
■ A visit to virtually any Little Theatre
performance will prove this. In spite of
free publicity given by soft-hearted jour-
nalists, the audience is almost invariably
composed of fellow-members of the
“group” (prepared to criticise freely),
relatives and friends of the actors, and a
sprinkling of false “intellectuals” to
whom attendance at a disturbance of this
nature is as much de rigueur as a place
In the May Day parade is to a right-
thinking radical. Occasionally, when
jsome stage-struck highlight of the
Vounger set can be flattered into taking
h part, these regulars will be augmented
by a few hangers-on to the fringe of
“society,” but a real honest-to-goodness
show *audience—never!
That the legitimate theatre should have
reached the point where the existence of
such impotent manifestations as this is
taken as a sign of returning vitality is
proof positive of a speedily approaching
end.
When the English stage was at its
height—even up to pre-war years —the
quality of the entertainment provided
and the public demand for it were such
as to discourage any but professional
mummers from making a serious public
appearance. England, the home of the
amateur, kept the amateur from her
stage. Amateur theatricals were con-
fined to the home or to charity bazaars;
they did not leap these barriers until
“The Sawmill,” etching by Max Ragless. ( Painter-Etchers’ and Graphic Art
Society’s show, Sydney.)
after the war, when most standards of
good taste were down.
It is a pity that the man-in-the-street,
the fellow who has always provided
actors, authors, managers and producers
with their bread and cheese, should not
be sensible to the fact that by patronis-
ing the talkies he is deliberately giving
one form of art a final kick in the mid-
riff ; but there you are. He has never
given things like that much thought. So,
in spite of the sighs of sentimental old
ladies who remember Julius Knight—
and what a fine figure of a man he was!
—and the ardent, if somewhat treble, ex-
hortations of the stalwarts (used figura-
tively) of the Little Theatre movement,
it seems necessary to furbish and test out
the passing-bell. There’ll soon be need
for it.
JOHN KENIWEEL.
The Critic.
The world is a disreputable theatre;
I am a critic of it,
On bad terms with the manager
Because of my wit.
For I was born to describe the
Poor farce precisely ;
He can neither take me in, bribe me
Nor chastise me.
I shall go on speaking my mind,
Forcing him to the soft
“Miss Jones, try to be kind
To poor Mr. Croft.”
She will dance for him who has bought
her
With the strained, mechanical grace
Her dear mother taught her,
And a smile smeared on her face.
To the blurting of an obscene orchestra,
Tearing her childlike body in its rage;
She will melt her legs in the glare
Of the white heat of the stage,
Twisting her lips as the nerves twist
Into a smiling scar
Like a wincing contortionist
On an inhuman crossbar;
And, seduced by her weary agility,
I shall grow into a grin;
I shall sign my name to futility,
And be taken in.

A Mae West
Story
A lady of more
than 40 summers
whose movie
stock-in-trade is
an hour-glass
figure, a hip-shot
walk and a particularly good knowledge
of the habits and speech of a demi-mon-
daine has succeeded in bluffing the
movie-goer into accepting her as some-
thing new and entertaining. Not only
have the movie Moguls put her in pic-
tures ; they have accepted her stories —or
reminiscences shall we say? —as vehicles
for her art, as well as spending thousands
of dollars on publicity.
New adjectives have been coined by
publicity agents to describe her origi-
nality, flappers have accepted her precepts
as their guide, smoking-room stories of
generations past have been dug up and
made over to fit her, and a catchword
phrase with questionable implications is
on everyone’s lips.
In short, Mae West is the most pub-
licised movie star of the moment, and it
is worth while considering whether the
whole business is not one of those inex-
plicable lapses from sanity of a people
who exude efficiency, shrewdness and
democracy, but who at the same time
accept the theory of “spoils to the vic-
tors” in politics, Aimee McPherson in
religion and European titleholders,
spurious and genuine, in their social life.
Mae is undeniably fortyish. The close-
up of her face is a triumph of the
cameraman’s art, but at best the camera
lies in a half-hearted way. Facial ex-
pression of emotion consists of a dis-
closure of teeth through half-opened lips
and a feline come-hither glance through
languorously-drooping eyelashes.
The famous hip-walk is one affected
greatly by the ladies of Ratcliffe High-
way in the pre-war hobble-skirt period
and by stage comedians when the laughs
are not coming from the stomach, but
one now definitely excised from the de-
portment curriculum. In her own words,
“I use movements of my body to cap-
tivate, instead of physical contact”
(“Motion Picture Mag.,” June, 1934).
The voice is doubtless striking, being
used in the best Bowery mode, but 't
grates on the ear of the sensitive, and the
flow of wisecracks seems oddly out of
place from feminine lips.
The women she portrays are those who
in real life provide the Divorce Court
with co-respondents, the drug-peddler
with a clientele, and the N.S.W. Govern-
ment with a reason for the Consorting
Act.
Miss West’s first picture traced the ad-
ventures of a harpy who developed from
a circus trollop to a “big-time” gold-
digger. Her succeeding ones have fol-
lowed similar courses in over-emphasised
sex interludes with suggestive or frankly
indecent dialogue, discreetly cut by Cres-
well O’Reilly, but in none of them has
she shown nearly as much originality as
vulgarity.
One of the least pleasing features is the
flood of questionable publicity. On every
side one is assailed with jokes of vary-
ing degrees of rawness concerning her
alleged habits and proclivities. Her
name is before the public at the cost of
her reputation. Again it is distasteful to
hear children recounting risque stories
and Mae West conundrums which cer-
tainly do not suit the nursery.
One cannot but admire the energy and
smartness of the woman in successfully
peddling her act to astute movie pro-
ducers, who, in turn, are unloading it on
the public. Like her eminent compatriot
Barnum she has worked on the theory
that a fool is born every minute and
most of them live —in America. But per-
haps the most arresting proof of the
rapid Americanisation of Australia is the
fact that we also are being submerged
by the flood of rubbish connected with
the lady.
On the other hand we have to sneak
down an alleyway to read a smuggled
copy of the “Decameron” or “Brave New
World.”

Australian
Films
Puzzling?
A recently ar-
rived film execu-
tive informs us
that Australian
talkies are _ re-
ceived with
apathy by English audiences, the dia-
logue being unintelligible to the average
listener.
Australian talkies to date have not been
likely to advance our prestige abroad,
but to say their language is not under-
stood in England is making it rather hot.
If a British audience can follow the slang
and wisecracks of an American under-
world film, the only reason why Austra-
lianisms are beyond if is because it does
not get enough of them.
I do not advocate the piling of cur-
rent colloquialisms on top of the kan-
garoos, kookaburras, etc., with which
most locally produced films have been
handicapped, but the future of Austra-
lian films and of Australian literature is
linked in that they must compete with
the rest of the world while retaining
their originality or personality, or what-
ever you like to call it. Instead of model-
ling our films on the second-rate theatri-
cal successes of last decade, our direc-
tors will have to base their standards on
the best world films produced to date,
and then project their imaginations two
years ahead of them. Australian films
must be Australian —not imitations of
English or American talkies, or cheap
melodramas cluttered with marsupials and
city actors in unaccustomed clothes and
artificial bush settings. The road to suc-
cess lies in better and more intelligent
direction, up-to-date scenarios, and,
above all, decent, credible casting.

Current
Artbursts
A couple of
dozen artists are
represented in the
collection on ex-
hibition at
Sedo n ’ s, Mel-
bourne. They range from etchings by
Zorn and Brangwyn and Walcot to “pic-
tures” worked in silk by E. M. Richard-
son. A number of Norman Lindsay’s
etchings, old and new, are included,
as well as a dozen dexterously-handled
Spanish scenes which Lionel Lindsay
has just brought back with him.
Harold Herbert, John Goodchild, John
Shirlow, Herbert Rose and the late
Penleigh Boyd are all represented by
excellent examples. Perhaps the most
interesting bunch, seeing that all are
on view for the first time, are the
lino-cuts of Murray Griffin. Remark-
able are these both for design and color,
while the execution is so skilful that if
is difficult to believe that they have not
been touched up after the roller has done
its work. For those who admire this
brand of art, Griffin’s work will have an
irresistible appeal. The silken tapestries
—or whatever is their technical name—
are most successful in black and white,
looking, at first glance, like boldly-
sketched pen-drawings. In color, the de-
vice would have been more successful
if strictly decorative effects had been
aimed at. Silken threads are not the
medium for capably revealing the natur-
alistic —or near-naturalistic.
The Continental side of the paintings
bought by Hans Heysen for Adelaide Art
Gallery is represented largely by Lucien
Simon. “The Widow” is a faithful ren-
dering of peasant figures, with shore and
a church rather slapped in as back-
ground. His other work is a chapel,
with women, the artist evidently delight-
ing in his detail. The Millet is only
a fine crayon of some very old church
unnamed, and probably a preliminary
study for a picture. Matthew Maris has
a negro boy’s head —great work; and
Leon Bakst a Persian dancer study, all
motion and vivid coloring. From
London there is a moonrise-in-timber by
Clausen, ghostly and dim. It is always
interesting to see what a painter really
fancies to live with ; and three bought
by Heysen for himself hang with the
rest. Philip Connard’s studio, with self-
portrait ; a Clausen in winter, very
foggy ; washerwomen by Millet. On the
whole, a lot of clever studies, interesting
rather than characteristic, with the
Bakst the only one you could put a name
to at sight.

trite, there are fewer bright lines than are
usual even; in musicomedy, the music
isn’t even catchy,.and the situations.are
of the sort which a sophisticated onlooker
can .see* being mechanised five minutes
ahead., The charm of the whole perform-
ance' — and there 'is charm centres
in the magnificent costuming of the
performers, their grouping, their dancing
and the lighting effects. This is the first
opportunity that. Cyril Ritchard has had
to show his calibre as a producer, and
he has made good. • ;
Roberta is a kindly soul who, after a
hectic youth, devoted her old age to build-
ing up a frock shop in Paris. She has as a
chief assistant and confidante Stephanie
—a princess in Russia before the revolu-
tion. To visit Roberta comes her nephew
from America, where he has been a
popular hero on the football gridiron
and a dumb-bell in social circles. His
lack of small talk and other social graces
has got on the nerves of his N’Yark
sweetie, and she has turned him down
just before he crosses the Atlantic.
Roberta dies, leaving a will unsigned,
and, instead of Stephanie getting the
business as the testator intended, the
whole outfit goes to the footballer. You
can see the finish —the fadeout with
Stephanie nestling in his arms and the
frigid New Yorker grinding her teeth.
But before this happens there is a full
act with five scenes filled to overflowing
with dances, posturings, mannequin
parades and cabaret settings.
Madge Elliott is a delightful Stephanie.
Her acting is natural, her singing is sweet
and her mannequin display is a delight.
But she and Ritchard have little dancing.
Frank Leighton shines as the footballer,
and Jean Duncan provides a good study of
the society gold-digger who plays fast and
loose with the young man’s affections
until Stephanie comes along to open his
eyes. Ethel Morrison reappears as
Roberta, after years of absence from the
Australian stage, and makes such excel-
lent use of the small material provided
by the author that it seems an utter waste
of good actress. The humors of the piece
are in the hands of Marie le Varre as
an amorous Polish damsel and Leo
Franklyn as a Yankee “hoofer” who has
strayed over to Paris with the rest.
George Willoughby makes a breezy Eng-
lish peer, and John Dudley is sidetracked
as a Russian aristocrat who has been
placed on the retired list by Stalin.

Something new in dramatic enter-
tainments was provided at Colling-
wood (Vic.) Town Hall last week when
deaf mutes—eight *of them—produced
a play. The story was not simply
revealed by pantomime ; the characters
worked off their wisecracks in the deaf
and dumb language, the uninitiated por-
tion of the audience being provided for
by a gentleman acting like a Greek
chorus, describing, the progress of events
as the play went along. The actors were
all amateurs, but ■ showed considerable
talent, making the audience wonder
whether many other amateur actors
would not improve their technique by
finger dialogue.

In “Mother Goose,” the panto, at
Melb'. King’s,' Frank Neil has wisely de-
cided to return to first principles and
turn out what is almost wholly a kids’
show. We have not had many panto-
mimes of late years; but many of what
there have been were more suited to the
tired businessman and the sophisticated
flapper than the youngsters. But here
we have, a story coherent, enough and
romantic enough to satisfy children, a
brand of humor which delights them and
a wealth of color and movement which
is calculated to make them see the pic-
tures in their fairy books come to life.
Moreover, a large proportion of the per-
formers-are themselves youngsters, and
clever youngsters at that. The outstand-
ing feature of the panto, is the ballets,
carried out by a capable lot. The toy bal-
let'in the first act is something that the
kiddies grow hysterical over, and the rose
ballet in the second act appeals to all
ages. Hetty King makes a dashing prin-
cipal boy, Pat Wenman is a charming
second boy and Isobel Mahon as princi-
pal ■ girl sings and dances satisfactorily.
Jim Gerald, as the dame, and Stan Foley,
as the landlord, make a comical pair.
But the star performer is undoubtedly
William Hassan, back in his old favorite
part of the goose.

" The Y.A.L. boys who are appearing

more depressing than to hear an 11-year-
old boy sing “Love’s Old Sweet Song” or
one of the many “Mother” ballads which
are usually associated with a bar at clos-
ing time on Saturday. All the same, this
is easily the best show in town for the
children’s holiday treat, since pantos, are
“off.” • . '
THE LITTLE SISTERS.
QUEENSLAND.
Father Christmas did not forget the
Brisbane hospitals. At the General the
whole of the 20 wards were decorated,
each with a distinctive scheme. A Christ-
mas-tree blossomed in the majority of
them, hung with gifts for the patients.
Each of the inhabitants of the Dig-
gers’ ward found parcels beside his bed at
St. Martin’s on Christmas morning, and
the hospital was bright with balloons
and streamers and hydrangeas. At the
Anzac Hostel special decorations and
delicacies were provided.
The Bells, of Coochin, had a house-
party for Christmas, and Mrs. Ernest
Bell and daughters Patsy,.Cecil and Eliza-
beth were among the guests. Mrs. Wil-
liam Collins spent Christmas at Nindoo-
imbah, but early in the New Year she
sails for Maoriland. Daughter Beryl,
who has been, visiting Sydney with Aileen
Bell, has returned home.
So many of the population of Bris-
bane have hied them to Southport and
Coolangatta that it is a wonder that there
is enough sea to provide a dip apiece.
Pretty fair-haired Hazel Dale, of Syd-
ney, is holidaying with Commander and
Mrs. McFarland at the Naval Staff quar-
ters, and. there, is a number of house-
parties aboard our best-known yachts.
Mr. and Mrs., E. F. D’Arcy, Dorothy
D’Arcy and Gwen Martin are on the
Alieta. Ivan Bond has taken a party of
guests down the bay, and the Maldwyn
Davies pair, Dr. and Mrs. Nye, Mr. and
Mrs. Alf Huybers, all are entertaining
on their boats.
Ralph Billington and his mother are
off to Colombo early in 1935 to meet
sister Fifi, who has been touring Asia,
Russia and Europe.
The engagement of Marie Redwood,
elder daughter of Mr. and, Mrs. Charlie
Redwood, of Toowoomba, and W. K.
Copley, M.L.A., is announced. The Red-
woods are a musical family, and Vince
Redwood, once an M.L.A., who left
Queensland 20 years ago to study singing
and made :good under a' new Italian
name, is the bride-elect’s uncle. Arch-
bishop Redwood, of Maoriland, is a
great-uncle. . - , . .
The English women cricketers were
entertained by the Queensland Cricket
Association at a dinner at the Belle Vue
Hotel, with the Queensland team and the
officials of the Q.W.C.A. The Lady
Mayoress, as patroness of-the-Q.W.C.A.,
went along wearing rosewood angel-skin
lace relieved with a . sash belt of deeper
tone. Betty Archdale, the English
women’s skipper, looked smart in a
moulded gown of black satin with a
touch of dahlia red, and Miss K. Smith,
the Queensland captain, wore del-
phinium-blue elephant crepe, with a
shoulder posy of white camellias.
It seems , that 1935 will see as many
Queenslanders abroad as the past year.
Mrs. T. C. Beirne is taking ‘ grand-
daughter Mary Douglas to Colombo be-
fore the end of January ; and in May
Mrs. Lange Powell will hasten to England
to see son Keith, who is studying medi-
cine there.
The legal fraternity gathered in large
numbers-at Lennon’s Hotel to wish good
luck to H.' L Archdall, ex-Chief Police
Magistrate, recently retired. E. T. Real,
for the Bar, handed - over a wallet of
notes, and Nicol Robinson did the
honors for the solicitors.-
The Firmin McKinnons’ telephone was
busy for the week before the Ascanius
left for S’Africa, for Mrs. McKinnon, who
is one of the leading spirits in the Bush
Book Club, and the Lyceum Club, was
too ill to attend afternoon-teas arranged
in her honor. Her husband was the guest
at a couple of luncheon parties. The two
expect to see Brisbane again next Anzac
Day. . ,
Mr. and Mrs. John Mcßobert cele-
brated their silver-wedding ; anniversary
with a cocktail party : at the National
Hotel roof-garden. R. L. H.: Peterson
proposed the toast of , the bride and
’groom of 25 years ago.
An interesting wedding will take place
at the South .Yarra Church of England
on January 5, when Harold Wilson, son
of the late Mr. and Mrs. W. H. Wilson,
and grandson of the late Justice Harding,
of Brisbane, will marry Miss Ella Pepper,
only daughter of Mr. and Mrs. H. J.
Pepper, Park-street, South Yarra. The
newly-weds will make their home in Bris-
bane.
WESTRALIA.
Ex-Lady Mayoress Mrs. E. B. Sinclair
was entertained at morning-tea by some
80 or 90 wellwishers. The lounge of the
Ambassadors backgrounded the red-and-
white-striped matelasse of the guest of
honor, with its attendant tricorne hat,
and acting-hostess Mrs. A. E. Joyner’s
navy and white figured marocain. Mrs.
Jack Cox recited a poem of her own
composition dedicated to Mrs. Sinclair,
and the Mitchell lady, with a black matt
coat covering her magpie silks, presented
to the guest a Royal Stafford dinner
service.
Frances Riches and Francis Wilmott
became one at Christ Church, Claremont,
with the Rev. John Bell doing the arith-
metic. Honiton lace, specially woven for
the ’groom’s grandmother, floated over
frilled silk nets, through which shone the
glint of snowy satin; frills fell from
shoulder to elbow, and frothed around
the hem and train of the bridal draperies,
which were caught at the neck with
sprays of orange-blossom. Edith Hester’s
posy of Cecil Brunner roses was in keep-
ing with her period frock of Swiss em-
broidered voile with its headpiece of pink
organdie. Toasts were honored at the
Cottesloe home of the bride’s parents,
where Mrs. Riches’s Burgundy georgettes
were topped with black crin. straw.
The 103rd Howitzers celebrated the
festive season with a dance and talkie
shivoo. The dance-room was beflagged
and begumtipped, with a trail of the
saplings leading to the open-air gardens
and bar. Walt Disney’s cartoons were
interspersed with dancing, and supper
was an alfresco affair. Colonel Watts
piloted his lady’s beige georgettes with
their minglings of lace; Jean Murray
wound a black taffeta kerchief buccaneer-
wise around the throat of her inky vel-
vets ; Jean Morrison’s figured georgettes
were in Wedgwood blue, and Mrs. Mac-
Farlane wound moss-green velvet over
mushroom marocain.
Karrakatta Club members welcomed
their president, Mrs. D. D. Paton, on
her return after several months in Eng-
land and on the Continong. Her Pari-
sian gown of deepest Lido blue had a
deceptive corsage of parchment net, semi-
concealed by the presentation gladioli.
Vice-pres. Mrs. F. Dempster’s sea-blue
laces stood next to v.-p, Mrs. W. H. Vin-
cent’s mulberry Chantillies. Bridge, com-
petitions and a play by Mr. and Mrs.
Hugh Torrance were features of the
evening.
Diamond me/chants have been busy
with third-finger adornments for Christ-
mas fiancees. Alice Biggs wears a spark-
ling gift chosen by Keith Woodroffe and
Evelynn Parker’s ring was placed on her
finger by John Leggoe.
SOUTH AUSTRALIA.
Margaret, eldest daughter of Mr. and
Mrs. A. W. Jolly, of North Adelaide,
is being given a series of welcome-home
parties on her return from a trip to
England. Joan and Esme Reid, who also
recently returned from overseas with
their parents, are two more popular girls
who are being made the excuse for enter-
tainment.
Sir Archibald and Lady Weigall, with
their daughter, who were to have been
in Adelaide for Christmas, had to delay
their arrival due to Sir Archibald having
throat trouble ; but they got here on Box-
ing Day, and are now in a whirl of en-
tertainments arranged in their honor.
The Weigalls made hosts of friends when
resident at Government House. ,
Mrs. Lavingfon Bonython was hostess
of an afternoon party at her home, St.
Corantyn, when she entertained the com-
mittees of 10 kindergartens. The flowers
were beautiful. Mrs. H. J, Lipman,
president of the Hackney Free Kinder-
garten, who recently returned from
abroad, where she made a study of kin-
dergarten management, gave ; a resume of
her experiences in England and the
U.S.A. Harold Tideman sang, and Jean
Barbour contributed pianoforte solos.
Mrs. Bonython was smartly, gowned in
cream, pale pink and pale green flowered
crepe moulded to the figure„ Miss
Katherine Bonython chose powder-blue
silk with frills of chiffon, and Mrs. H. J!
Lipman favored fawn georgette and a
wide-brimmed fawn straw hat.
Edith, another of Colonel W. Dollman’s
daughters, became Mrs. McKnight on
Christmas Eve. The bride had previously
been given a surprise party by the wives
of Plympton Diggers at the home of
Mrs. W. K. Penny.
TASMANIA.
A country party that drew about 200
guests from Hobart and as many more
from the district round about was the
Frank Parsons’s afternoon affair at
Bloomfield, Gretna. Music and bridge
and the lovely garden to stroll in kept
everybody happy. Mrs. Parsons received
in navy and white marocain with hat to
match, and daughter Sheila was in floral
crepe in brown and beige shades, with
a big flat brown hat.
Friends’ School garden party, held in
the school grounds, drew a big crowd.
On the following Monday the speech-
night of the school at the Theatre Royal
had a special thrill provided by the pres-
ence of aviator Melrose. His Ex. and
Lady Clarke attended.
Dr. Arundel Orchard, who retired
some time ago from the directorship of
Sydney Con., has settled with his family
in Hobart. The Alan Mclntyres (Mrs.
Mclntyre is president of the Phil.) gave
a welcome party, and most of the musi-
cal folk turned up. Flowers everywhere
made splashes of color.
Launceston Players gave Stephen Phil-

Humor Story Entry:-
By FREEMAN
SANDOM
MY English cousin, Henry de Boeuf
Hohenaffen, has sent me an
account of his visit to the Chinese
quarter of Barrierville (N.Q.), one of the
ports-of-call during his recent globe-trot.
Included in the letter was a cheque for
£2O, which he requests me to convey
to the Chinese “dosshouse” in that town.
As a kid Henry was an exceptionally
succulent donkey, his mummy’s little
bookworm, with horn-rimmed specs, and
more money to spend than was good
for him. His yarn proves that he still
belongs to the long-eared family, and
I don’t blame the reporter who pulled
his leg (under the pseudonym Rudyard
Chesterton). As for the twenty, I am
sticking to it, Henry doesn’t need the
money, and the josshouse (or dosshouse,
as he calls it) is of course— — Well,
shorn of its windy pelt, here is Henry’s
account:
Long Soup 1 /-
Chong Quo greengrover
“Care for a plate?” asked Ruddy,
pointing.
I hesitated. The establishment differed
on many essential points from the good
Visit to the Chinese quarter.
old Savoy of London. Furthermore, a
De Boeuf Hohenaffen —a man who is
accustomed to pay one and even two
guineas for his lunch —naturally hesi-
tates to sit down to a shilling’s worth
of soup. Still, Rudyard Chesterton had
kindly volunteered to show me the local
Chinatown, and I did not like to dis-
appoint him. Again, Ruddy belongs to
quite a respectable family (being, as he
told me, a nephew of the famous writer),
and in my set it is an accepted dictum
that even a serious indiscretion may
safely be committed provided it is com-
mitted in good company. I decided to
risk a visit to Mr. Chong Quo’s.
“Quo vadis ?” I said, permitting myself a
little pleasantry, and adjusted my glasses.
Ruddy looked puzzled. It was plain
that, although a junior reporter on the
Barrierville “Standard,” his Latin was
limited.
“It means: ‘Lead on’,” I explained
kindly. He grasped the joke at once,
and, laughing heartily, led on.
THE shop contained a dusty counter
and a great number of dusty shelves
with a display of empty lemonade-bottles
and a dozen or so overripe bananas. At
a small table sat an elderly, fat Chinese
dressed in the flowing silk pyjamas of the
East. His eyes were, of course, inscrut-
able, and he wore the beard so popular
among citizens of the Celestial republic.
I counted the hairs, which were long,
coarse and black, and arrived at a total
of seven: three on the point of his reced-
ing chin, three on the left of it, one on
the right of it. I thought it a most un-
tidy display, and felt my appetite for
the long soup vanish.
“Mr. Pak-a-pu,” introduced Ruddy,
and placed a shilling on the table. “He
collects for a Chink charity,” he ex-
plained.
I followed his example, trusting my
contribution would be used for a worthy
purpose. From a bundle the collector
took a rectangular piece of flimsy paper
on which were printed blue squares in-
scribed with Chinese characters. He
dipped a paintbrush into a tin of boot-
black and marked a number of the
squares.
“Your receipt,” remarked Ruddy, and
mind the Johns don’t spot it.”
Observing my evident puzzlement, he
added: “They would only pester you for
contributions for their own chari-
ties.”
“My dear Ruddy,” I exclaimed,
“the police is a worthy body of
men. I would only be too
pleased”
“You don’t know our North
Queensland policemen. They can
be embarrassingly pressing at
limes. Better let me take care of
that receipt.”
“Oh, very well,” I said, humor-
ing him, a little amused at his
concern for my comfort.
“A n d now quo vadis?”
Ruddy laughed, evidently pleased
to pick up the Latin phrase, and
again he led on.
I FOLLOWED him through a
narrow doorway and stopped
in surprise. The room presented
a sharp contrast to the quiet, semi-
commercial atmosphere of the outer
apartment. It was full of men, mostly
Chinese, with a sprinkling of women,
all jostling round a table which was
brightly illuminated by a huge kerosene-
lamp suspended from the roof. Curi-
ously, a preponderance of the Chinese
“You are a perfect jay, Mr. Hohenaffen."
were of advanced years, their backs being
bent with age. I remarked, in a careful
aside, on the gathering of so many
crooked spines.
“Hush!” whispered Ruddy. “Don’t
use the word crook here.”
I thought this consideration for the
feelings of the afflicted most admirable
in a young man.
Suddenly I caught the eye of one of
the ladies. She was leaning nonchalantly
against the table puffing at a cigarette.
I blinked a little, for her personality was
of the most vivid kind. Her hair was a
platinum blonde, glittering with pearls.
Her eyes were black and dominating, her
complexion an. extraordinary healthy
pink, and the lips so glaringly scarlet
that artificial pigmentation was almost
suggested. Her frock was a flaming,
shimmery creation that began slovenly
late and ended surprisingly early. “A
magnificent creature,” I thought admir-
ingly.
“Hey, baby face,” she called, waving
a bediamonded hand to me. “Where’s
your mummy?” and again, a little
abruptly; “What do you want with a
fan-tan joints?”
I dislike a public exchange of banter,
and was about to reply with what dig-
nity I could muster that I had come to
sample a plate of long soup, and that
digestive considerations made joints a
prohibited luxury so late at night. But
Ruddy pulled me hastily aside. “That’s
Anvil Annie, queen of Chinatown,” he
whispered. “Keep your trap shut.”
He led me to the other side of the
room, from where, for the first time, I
could see what was going on. The first
to attract my attention was an iron plate
twelve inches by twelve inches and half an
inch thick. It was placed in the middle
of the table, and on it were arranged,
in an obscure decorative scheme, silver
coins and banknotes —in the centre, along
the sides, in the corners and even spilling
over to the table itself.
“This is a dosshouse,” murmured Ruddy
in explanation ; “a Chinese church, you
know. They’re taking up a collection for
indigent members of the congregation.”
1 nodded, much moved. It was indeed
a touching sight. With moist eyes I
watched a stream of devotees come for-
ward and place their offerings on the
sacred plate. The donors were of all
ages, well dressed or poorly clad ; and
their gifts ranged from the opulent bank-
note to the humble sixpence. 1 noticed
with surprise, and a little catch of the
breath, that men of the most pauperish
appearance were the most liberal givers.
“The poor are piteous upon the poor, ’
I quoted.
“Too right,” said Ruddy, and some-
thing else which I failed to catch.
The queen of Chinatown flipped a
pound note to the plate, lit a cigarette and!
winked at me. I smiled back admiringly :
she had the ways of royalty, that girL
I brought my hand to my breast pocket,
but Ruddy caught it in a grip of steel.
“Don’t flash money here,” he whispered ;
“someone might pinch it.”
In this sacred dosshouse!
Nevertheless, I yielded to his excessive
caution, resolving, however, to forward
a cheque to the church committee later.
AT this juncture I made an observa-
tion of quite scientific interest.
Several of these kind souls seemed doubt-
ful where to place their gifts, the hand
of benevolence hovering first over one
position on the plate, then wavering to
another, then perhaps back again.
I smiled inwardly, though a little sadly.
Rampant superstition! Abysmal ignor-
ance of the East, persisting even in
the enlight-
ened environ-
me n t of
Western

tion!
Suddenly a

priest,” whispered Ruddy. “The sacred
rites will now begin.”
At once another of the clergy threw
a handful of beans on the table, pro-
duced a stick, not unlike a golf club, but
shorter, and began to rake the beans
back, four at a time.

FACTS!
The only type of
circulation that
has real worth is that which is constant am)
embodies the confidence of readers. These
attributes are possessed only by the daily
newspapers whose circulations are derived, not
by contests, insurance schemes, or high pres-
sure methods, but by real merit. They are
bought because people want them in their
homes.
The daily newspaper
is so essential
to the New Zealander that even in times of
economic stress he continues to buy his
morning daily, so valuable is it for the
information it gives, both in its news and
advertisement columns.
Newspaper advertising is the most economical,
effective and forcible medium for reaching

According to my well-informed com-
panion, four is the sacred number of
this tong; the beans are the holy beans
of Confucius, grown in the
backyard of the dosshouse
with many ceremonial ob-
servances.
“Speaking about Con-
fucius, or more correctly
spelt Con-fuse-us,” he con-
tinued, “I presume you are
acquainted with his
works?”
Without waiting for a
reply he began to declaim
with much gusto:
“And then thyself a shining
sprat shall pass
To Him Who Plays With
Beans: Oh, Green-as-
grass.
If pak-a-pu didst not re-
move thy brass,
Fan-tan shud.”
Before i could point out
that these lines were
really from the Rhubarb of
Mr. O. K. Yam, there was
a stir at the table.
The officiating priest with the golf
club had continued his rhythmic and
solemn raking of the beans until three
only remained of the heap. This num-
ber had evidently a special signification,
for the high priest intoned a short but
impressive chant, and immediately the
distribution of largesse began.
It struck me as curious that a strap-
ping, rather flashily-dressed Chinese
should receive a considerable share of
the alms, but Ruddy explained that his
was a bad case.
“An internal complaint,” said Ruddy ;
“incipient leprosy and a severe disloca-
tion of the solar plexus, poor fellow.”
I had no time to reflect on this start-
ling information, for just then the door
to the outer room flew open, the Orien-
tal collector, Mr. Pak-a-pu, poked his
head inside and ejaculated in a sibilant
whisper the Chinese-sounding word
“Dicks!”
Immediately the
room was plunged
in darkness, and
there was much
bustle and scrap-
ing of feet. An
overpowering scent
of eau-de-Cologne
came to my nos-
trils, and 1 felt a
yielding, soft body
being pressed against mine. My heart,
! curiously enough, began to beat wildly ;
but while I was pondering on the be-
! havior of this organ the clinging body
seemed to be jerked away and there were
two oaths, one uttered in a masculine
voice, the other in unmistakably femi-
nine accents. Then a large hand grabbed
mine in a terrific grip, and presently I
found myself in a dark back street, some-
what bewildered and out of breath.
Naturally, I felt a little annoyed, but
Ruddy explained that all this was part
of the ceremony, a sort of tableau or
allegoric acting similar to the Oberam-
mergau Passion Play.
While he was explaining, I had a feel-
ing that' something was missing, and
suddenly I remembered.
“What about that long soup, Ruddy?”
I asked.
“Long soup?” he said thoughtfully.
“Oh, yes ; the long soup, to be sure. Quo
vadis, old fellow?”
Once more he led on, I following
somewhat mystified. We walked along
the street for a block or so, then Ruddy

Devotees.
turned into a narrow, dark passage, and
presently we stood before a long counter
in a dimly-lit room.
“Two long soups,” said
Ruddy to the shadowy
waiter.
LONG soup, I am told, is
a Chinese preparation. It
is made from beche-de-mer,
meat, vegetables and divers
unknown ingredients.
In this case it was served
in tall glasses, and, as far
as I could see in the gloom,
had a kind of frothy sur-
face. To infuse a touch of
romance into the consum-
mation of long soup, the
proprietor closes the doors
to the street and dims the
lights. A proceeding which
I thought very quaint and
interesting.
My boat was due to leave
at ten o’clock the next
morning, and, good fellow
as he is, Ruddy turned up
to wish me God-speed.
We were chatting hap-
pily of the previous night’s incidents
when he produced a notecase which I
saw at once was mine. He handed it to
me, saying he had received a psychic
communication that morning to the effect
that I had lost the case, and that Anvil
Annie had found it. Upon paying her
a visit he found the ghostly message to
be correct.
This young man has extraordinary
gifts, I thought; he will go far. I
thanked him warmly, and also asked him
to convey my thanks to the queen. He
said he would, and laughed in his happy
fashion.
Suddenly I remembered my promise
of the night before, and, abstracting a
five-pound note from the case, passed it
to him with the request to hand it to
the high priest of the dosshouse. This
he promised to do, laughing happily as
usual.
A bell clanged,
and we shook
hands.
“You are a per-
fe c t jay, Mr.
Hohenaffeb,” said
Ruddy. “We’ll
keep your memory
green here in Bar-
riervifle for a long
time to come.”
I thanked him,
much moved. I flatter myself I
have made quite an impression on
this simple, sturdy backwoodsman, ana
have perhaps brought a stimulating
whiff from the great wide world to his
sleepy little hamlet in North Queens-
land. , , .
“Toodle-oo!” I called as the boat
began to move away from the wharf.
“Look me up at the Savoy if you ever
come to London.”
One morning three months later I was
opening my mail, rather languidly, for
I had sat up late the night before over
an extremely interesting novel, and
I noticed a letter with an Australian
postmark. Out' of it fell a money-
order for £2O, and with it a note: “Bread
upon the waters. Four loaves to one.”
That night, as I sat over the nuts and
wine in my beloved Savoy, memories
came to me of the queen of Chinatown,
of the famous North Queensland long
soup, of the kindly dosshouse people,
and I decided to send the money to them
per favor of my Australian cousin.

THEY got it, too. I never had luck

Requiescat.
Where she now lies the waters drowse and
doze.
Barred from the pulse and swell of the high
seas,
Upon a haunted beach she dies at ease,
Wasting away before her only foes—
Time, and the patient worm, and creeping
tides.
Upon her bulwarks perches the white gull;
The limpet breeds and clings upon her hull;
The idle ripple lisps against her sides.
No loud gale thrums in her dismembered spars;
The slumbering inlet, ever calm and still,
Reflects the inky shadow of the hill,
Her corpse dishonored and the tremulous stars.
No more her timbers creak under the shock
Of naughty winds; she fears no crouching rock.
Here let her moulder silently away
Into forgetfulness and dumb decay.

The Hawthorn.
Virginly the hawthorn steps in white
Across the threshold of September,
Maidenly, and hived with light
Love’s harvest from last December.
Her last tryst was with the winter gale, .
And the bees probe and sip her secret,
But she laughs, and her pale, thin hail
Swoons as the fall of an egret.
The lover who busked her is over the seas.
Blowing his wild breath into ships white
sails;
Does he remember the green-brown hawthorn
trees,
And their sweet, slim limbs, and his reckless
tales?
The red tumult of her heart now sings
Ineffably white, for she is virginal of love,
And the bees fly tipsy of her lips, with wings
Heavy, and legs dripping with spring s first
trove.

COWARD HCNTY
Henty’s First Wool Store
Edward Henty was the first permanent white settler
in Victoria, having established his home at Portland,
where he landed on 19th November, 1834. He had
sailed from Launceston, where his father, Thomas
Henty, had previously settled with his four sons.
The Henty family introduced the first Merino sheep
into Victoria, and thus are the pioneers of the great
pastoral industry of that State.
The Bank of New South Wales was established 17
years before Edward Henty settled in Victoria in
1834, and 17 years later, in 1851, when the early
Victorian gold discoveries were attracting prospectors
and traders from all parts of the world, the Bank
opened its first office in Melbourne.
For 117 years the Bank of New South Wales, the first
Australian bank, has been closely identified with the
development of Australia's resources, and to-day,
with over 720 branches throughout Australia, New
Zealand, the Pacific Islands and London, provides
the most complete banking service for all sections
of the community.

My Political
Life
By W. A. HOLMAN
MINORITY
GOVERNMENT
We had escaped
so far only be-
cause one of their
men was still
missing. With Cann in the Chair and
our two men gone, our total numbers
were reduced to 43 against the Opposi-
tion’s 44. At any moment when every
man was there, Wade might move the
adjournment and carry it by one vote,
thus taking the business of the House
out of our hands and compelling our
resignation. Our almost immediate ex-
tinction as a Government stared us in
the face.
Had we grasped the situation in all its
bearings the night before, when our sup-
porters actually present constituted a
substantial majority, it would have been
our obvious policy, to have moved there
and then for an adjournment for a
month, thus getting time enough to fight
the by-elections, and so perhaps win
back our seats, and with them our
majority. But on that night, as I have'
said, I had not grasped the full extent of
the danger, and still counted on some, if
not all, of the Independents.
On the next night, when the voting on
the supply bill turned out to be equal,
it was almost impossible to take any
such step. From minute to minute the
one missing Opposition member might
arrive and put the enemy into a definite
majority with which to end us. We de-
cided to adjourn at once, without a
moment’s delay, while we could
still count on the casting vote of the
Speaker.
On the first night we were not suffi-
ciently alarmed ; on this second we were
perhaps a little too much so, though I
do not think so. True, we might have
moved for a month’s adjournment then
and there. But we could not have done
that without leading to a debate. Dur-
ing that debate the missing Opposition-
ist might have turned up at any time.
The debate, it may be said, might have
been clotured. But could it have been?
The numbers were equal. Cann would
probably not have given his casting vote
for ending the debate, or even for sup-
pressing an individual speaker. In any
case, the process would have taken time,
and one additional minute might have
been fatal. In endeavoring to save every-
thing we should have lost everything. As
it was we gained a night and a day in
which, if possible, to reconstruct our
position.
The first and most obvious resource
was to endeavor to persuade some of
the Independents to support us. This
had already been begun during the after-
noon hours of the previous day. They
had been, and were being, tried one by
one, members of the Ministry and other
active members
of the party
being deputed
to see each
of them. This
was a long and
difficult job, but
by the morning of
the Thursday it
was fairly appar-
ent that it was not
going to succeed.
We had had
special hopes in
one or two direc-
tions, but they
came to nothing.
By then the Inde-
pendents had all
been whipped
back into their
true places in the
ranks of the
Opposition. We
were for the
moment in a defi-
nite minority.

BATTLE OF
TACTICS
As soon as 1
realised this I
realised also that
to drift on to the
moment of defeat was to finally abandon
hope for this Parliament, as, under our
practice, a Government which has come
into office over the dead bodies of its
opponents as the result of a Parliamen-
tary struggle has the right to dissolve if
it is beaten in turn. Its opponents, being
dead, have to stay dead ; the House is
regarded as “exhausted” when two Min-
istries have been successively formed
from it, and an appeal to the constituen-
cies is the next step. If we were once
beaten, therefore, it would avail us little
to win back the two vacated seats and
thus re-establish our majority. Wade
once in, if beaten by us again, could
appeal to the people, and although the
prospect of such an experience, rightly
considered, should fill a democratic bosom
with joy, I was far from persuading
myself that the results would be entirely
gratifying at that moment.
I accordingly held a further gathering
of Ministers at about 11 a.m., and the
following plan of campaign was decided
upon. It was agreed that I should see the
Lieut.-Governor and
ask him, in view of the
special happenings of
the week, to prorogue
Parliament so that the
by-elections arising ou'
of the two vacancies
could be held and re-
presentatives returned
In the event of Sir Wil-
liam Cullen declining to
adopt this advice we
were to tender our
resignation.
The advantages of
this scheme in the cir-
cumstances were these:
If the Lieut.-Governor
fell in with our view:
the contest was shiftec
to the two Labor con-
stituencies, where we
had a fair prospect of
winning. If, on the
other hand, he refused
our advice we should
resign without having
been defeated in Par-
liament. A new Minis-
try following us would
come in, therefore, without any con-
stitutional claim to a dissolution. If
we got back our full strength as the
result of the by-elections, the new Min-
istry could be beaten and our unde-
feated Government re-established in the
same Parliament. A memorandum ad-
vising this course was, I think, drawn up
and forwarded to his Excellency forth-
with for his consideration, and in some
way we obtained from him a statement
of his opinion that this course could not
be accepted.
During the morning of this day, how-
ever, a singular development occurred.
Estell, the Whip, came in with the news
that a friend of his who had influence
with Gilljes, the Independent member for
Maitland, had obtained a promise from
Gillies that, while not voting with the
Government, he would be absent from
the House on the division. This would
leave the numbers even, and Cann as
Speaker would give a casting vote in our
favor.
THE situation was saved if this was
trustworthy. But was it? Obvi-
ously the only person who could tell us
was Gillies himself. We spent the whole
of the rest of the morning trying to get
hold of him in vain. At lunchtime I had
a hasty consultation with the Ministers
then available, and it was agreed between
us that unless we were quite clear about
winning on the division we should act on
our decision and resign without being
defeated rather than face a vote in the
House.
At about 2.30 p.m. Estell, who with
all other available emissaries was out in
quest of the elusive Gillies,' telephoned
to the House that matters were all right
and the undertakjjng was confirmed. This
message reached me through some other
hand, and for a moment we breathed
again. But when Estell arrived at the

House it appeared, to our disgust and
horror, that he had not seen Gillies him-
self. He had merely seen his friend once
again, and the friend had renewed the
assurance of yesterday.
It was by this time about four o’clock,
and there was only a small group of the
Ministers in their rooms at Parliament
House. I got them together yet again
and put before them my own feeling
that this assurance, not coming from
Gillies himself, was worthless, and,
further, might even be sent to us as a
trap. As a matter of fact, it turned out
to be quite misleading, and Gillies later
repudiated it altogether. All who were
there, some three or four only, con-
curred. I got them to agree that I should
act at once on the lines decided upon. It
was arranged that a large number of
questions should be asked by our own
supporters and answered at length by
Ministers, to postpone as late as possible
the moving of any motion, in order that
I might see the Lieut.-Governor, tender
our resignation, return and announce it
before the Opposition could take advan-
tage of its majority. This was done.
THE GOVERNMENT
RESIGNS
I went to Gov-
ernment House in
a quick car, and
found Sir William
Cullen there, to whom I explained the
position. He met me with his wonted
cordiality, and in spite of my mission in-
sisted on my discussing the situation
across a tea-table. I kept in view, the
necessity for a quick return, and ulti-
mately got back to Parliament House still
a little before five, without, I fear, too
close an observance of the speed regula-
tions.
The younger members of the party had
held the fort gallantly in my absence.
Their thirst for information had been ex-
tensive and peculiar. My friend Scobie,
member for Wentworth, had, I believe,
particularly distinguished himself by the
length, variety and intricacy of the ques-
tions with which his mind had become
suddenly racked as to every department
of Government activity,’ and up to the
time I got back to Parliament House no-
thing had been done. 1 rose at once and
announced, amidst a dramatic silence,
that, in view of certain advice which had
been tendered by us to the Lieut.-Gov-
ernor that day and his Excellency’s in-
ability to see his way to act upon that
advice, I had that afternoon placed in
his hands the resignation of my col-
leagues and myself.
I do not think I am wrong in saying
that this move fell like a thunderbolt on
the Opposition. I have never discussed
the incident with any of its members
since, but I do not think any of them
had the faintest premonition of such a
step on our part. . Real, unpretended
stupefaction reigned.
When I had finished, of course, a
whole babel of interrogations broke
forth. To these I replied as well as I was
able, but I took refuge without hesita-
tion in the necessarily confidential charac-
ter of statements made to the Governor.
Business forthwith came to an end, and
the House adjourned. Wild excitement
prevailed.
The Opposition newspapers, almost
with one accord, acclaimed our down-
fall as an emancipation. The end of our
impossible reign had come earlier than
they had hoped. Our action during the
last few hours seemed mysterious, but no
one saw any special significance in it.
Otherwise everything was as clear as
crystal. We had maintained ourselves
into the session-such was the official
theory —for a month or two by a silly in-
trigue with the Independents. That had
now been put a stop to by appropriate
means, and necessarily we were forced to
resign.
No one seemed to realise, or, at all
events, no one who made any public
declaration of it did, that the resignation
might be only a step in the party strategy.
It was universally considered that our
end had come, and very properly so, too,
and none troubled to ask whether such
an end might not be the prelude to a
glorious resurrection.
Meanwhile the Lieut.-Governor com-
menced the awkward task of negotiating
with Wade for the formation of a new
Ministry.
BACK TO
OFFICE
During the suc-
ceeding stages of
these complex ad-
ventures we were
twice saved by the quickness of thought
and general alertness of Arthur Griffith.
Without pausing to discuss the new
position with me or any other Minister
he had arrived at the conclusion that the
situation was now to be saved by Cann
retiring from the Speaker’s chair.
On the evening of our
resignation he accord-
ingly had an interview
with Cann. They were
the two members for
Broken Hill, and were
in many ways closely
associated. In the morn-
ing the Premier-desig-
nate, Wade, was con-
fronted with the prob-
lem of getting not merely
a new Ministry but a
new Speaker, as well as
fighting the two by-elec-
tions.
Events now marched
rapidly. The position
created by the Speaker’s
resignation was, as Grif-
fith had foreseen, alto-
gether too difficult for
Wade. The House was
for the moment only 88
strong. Of these he counted 44. He
could not appoint a new Speaker and
meet Parliament without being imme-
diately defeated. After a day or two of
effort he decided that he could not carry
on without prorogation, and Sir William
Cullen decided, with strict impartiality,
that he could not grant a prorogation to
one side after he had refused it to the
other. I was sent for and asked if I
would resume office. I explained that it
was impossible to do so without the pro-
rogation, and to this he agreed.
We thus re-entered triumphantly upon
the discharge of our suspended Minis-
terial duties. Not that we could per-
suade ourselves for a moment that the
crisis was over. But in the first round,
at all events, we were ahead on points,
and we could look forward to the next
one, which consisted of the fight in the
two vacated electorates, with considerable
hope. Both seats were ours —why should
the voters of either abandon us? The
writs accordingly were issued, and the
whole forces of both parties transferred
themselves to the territories of the Mud-
gee and Liverpool Plains seats.
Our distracted leader, McGowen, who
had by this date reached the United States,
received there a rapid series of cable-
grams successively informing him that he
was out of office, back in office and —
most true of all—exceedingly likely to
be out of office again. He afterwards, in
a speech which I heard, drew a spirited
parallel between himself at this time and
the immortal Finnigan of the poem, who
wired about a railway truck that it was
“off agin, on agin, out agin, in agin, Fin-
nigan.” But at that moment, I have
no doubt, he accepted these disturbing
messages with his usual granite imper-
turbability.
MINISTRY AND
TRADES HALL
In the mean-
while what had
become of Dunn
and Horne, the
innocent cause of all this difficulty?
Horne had disappeared. He was a novice
who had been rather sickened by his few
months’ experience of Parliament, and
Estell.
at the moment he had no desire to go
farther with it. Dunn, however, was of
different metal. He had already begun
to repent of his precipitate act, and,
meeting some few days later T. Crawford,
another of our members, sent him back
to us with the glad tidings that he was
prepared and, indeed, eager to return to
the friendly companionship of his former
colleagues. This was excellent news,
because if we could run Dunn for his
former seat we could retain it. Under
the movement’s rules, however, the con-
sent of the executive had to be gained
before this could be given effect to. The
executive of those days, though not the
dreadful chamber which it has since be-
come, was very hostile to us, and was
headed by the editor of the Sydney
“Worker,” Hector Lamond, a stern pre-
cisian, who had then had no Parliamen-
tary experience himself
and who could never
see why the strict letter
of any rule could be de-
parted from in order, as
he would put it, “to do
a favor to a politician.”
The fact that the life of
the Ministry was at
stake was of no conse-
quence (in those days)
to Lamond. The sooner
certain Ministries died
the better. The execu-
tive, therefore, had to be
convinced. This was
done. It took some do-
ing ; every doubtful
member of that august
body was interviewed
and the full strength of
the situation explained to
him personally. When
the meeting was held
Lamond, accustomed to the support
of sweeping majorities in its counsels,
found himself deserted by all but a small
minority of stalwarts, and the erring
lamb was welcomed back into the fold
by his rejoicing comrades, and duly nomi-
nated as candidate.
The two elections were short and sharp,
but distressingly indecisive. We won
with Dunn, but lost with our other can-
didate, who was defeated by three votes.
We. should muster, when Parliament re-
assembled, 45 all.
EXIT
NEILSEN
During these
adventures Neil-
sen had made up
his mind to re-
sign, and, with his usual downrightness,
he repudiated all attempts at compromise.
He felt that he had precipitated the
party into these difficulties-by his unyield-
ing attitude, and, although he still had
no idea of yielding, he insisted, in spite
of every effort to dissuade him, upon
leaving us.
Thus ended, after nine brief months,
his only term of office as a Minister. The
country lost in him one of its few abso-
lutely fearless and upright public men
and one of the ablest administrators I
have ever met. During his brief stay at
the Lands Office he reorganised it entirely.
He brought the Ministerial work up to
date (a thing unknown for the previous
30 years —when he took office there
were cases which had waited for a year
upon the Minister’s table for decision);
drafted all the land legislation of our
programme ; found time to give the
metropolis its Zoo and Neilsen Park, and
even prepared a fine scheme (unhappily
abandoned after his departure) for saving
for the public the remainder of Sydney’s
rapidly-disappearing harbor foreshores.
He went out on terms of full friendliness,
and continued in his post as secretary of
the party, but his withdrawal meant the
loss of one of the Cabinet’s most force-
ful personalities.
To me in particular his departure was
an almost stunning calamity. For the
five years which had preceded our taking
office we had worked together, as deputy-
leader and secretary of the party, then in
opposition, in a way which had created
a perfect understanding between us. Cir-
cumstances had been most discouraging.
The enemy without had been overwhelm-
ingly strong, and the difficulties within
hardly less so. Yet, by continuous
patience and much labor, we had gradu-
ally beaten the one and surmounted the
other. Our plans—for truly they were
ours, and hardly shared in, in 1905, by
any other member of our team, so chi-
merical did they seem —had ripened into
the really fine achievement of 1910. We
now had a tremendous task before us, in
the doing of which I had looked forward
to the constant display by Neilsen of the
same loyalty and untiring industry. But
as this was not tp be I had to solace my-
self with the thought that all was not lost
and that we could still count on him as
secretary. Nevertheless, between Minis-
ter and private member there must always
be a gulf, which prevents anything like
the close co-operation of colleagues.

be given in next week’s Bulletin.]

Take a look at those happy people . , . watch them

. . . why? Because they're busy .-. . producing
something . . . helping someone, somewhere .
holding their end up . . . filling the niche in industry
that makes them worth while . . . with a smile . , .

Now look at the miserable souls . , . bored con-

envious?
Here's our creed for 1935
.Jl. We believe that there is in Australia, to-day, a
job for all who really need one, and the better
that job is done the more work will it create,
We believe that the secret of national pros-
perity, lies in economically organised produc-
tion, and clever, persistent salesmanship.

the highest reward. Nations as well as
individuals should strive for it.
