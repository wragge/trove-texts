Weakness and Debility.
Parramatta, Sept. 10,1888.
Sir,— Four years ago I caught a severe cold which
settled in my head and chest and caused an incessant
cough and copious discharge of phlegm, this brought
on great weakness and debility ; after considerable
attention and doctors’ treatment the cough was
relieved and finally cured, but the debility remained
and seemed to defy the skill of the medical men and
the power of medicine. I had no appetite, and could
scarcely eat a single particle of food, and was almost
reduced to a skeleton, having entirely, wasted away ;
I had taken pints of cod-liver oil, malt extracts and
other medicines without relief, when I was
recommended to take Clements’ Tonic. I procured
a bottle, and am thankful to say that I immediately
began to improve, 1 could eat better, and relish and
digest what I did eat; I gained flesh every day, and
my strength rapidly returned, and, after six week’s
treatment with your Tonic, 1 felt a new woman
altogether. 1 took your Tonic six months ago, and
have never had any sickness since, and am only to
glad to add my name to your list of grateful sufferers.
Yours sincerely,
MARY KELLETT
Nervous Debility.
Castlereagh St., Sydney, Feb. 1, ’89.
Dear Sir, —For some time past I have been in the
hands of the doctors, and 1 can truthfully assert that
I obtained not the slightest benefit. I heard of
Clements’ Tonic, and have taken three bottles,
with such marked good results as to cause me to write
and congratulate you on the very excellent virtues of
your remedy.
It has completely cured me of all my disorders,
and 1 feel myself an entirely different man. A friend
of mine to whom 1 gave a bottle, half of w hich he has
taken, says he feels wonderfully better in his general
health, and, with myself, begs to cordially thank you
for giving the public the benefit of your skill in
manufacturing such a splendid Tonic. 1 do not w ish
my-name used in print, but hope you are very pros-
perous in the sale of your medicine, as you justly
deserve.
I am, dear Sir,
Yours faithfully,
F. M. Clements, Esq.,
141 King Street, Newtown.
Anaemia and Weakness.
Windsor, October 27,1888.
Mr. F. M. Clements,
Sir, — I am very pleased to say that I have taken
only two bottles of your WONDERFUL TONIC, with
the most desirable and astonishing effect. I have been
a long sufferer from loss of blood and weakness, but
after taking your medicine, the change in me is
remarkable. ' I think IT IS A BOON to the
SUFFERING COMMUNITY.
I am, yours truly,
E. SMILT.
Debility and Indigestion.
Richmond, October 5, 1888.
Mr. F. M. Clements,
Dear Sir,— It is with feelings of great pleasure
that 1 pen these few lines. I have been a sufferer from
GENERAL DEBILITY and INDIGESTION forthelast
five (5) years, and have tried almost every known
remedy without the slightest benefit. I had given up
all hopes of being cured, when by good luck I saw your
Tonic advertised in the “Windsor Gazette.” 1 deter-
mined to try it, and after the third dose the change was
remarkable. I took three bottles, and now feel like a
new man altogether.
I am a hawker, and in my travels I shall recommend
it to all that I see. Again thanking you,
I am, yours sincerely,
WILLIAM JAMES MAUKES.
Nervous Exhaustion.
Wagga Wagga N.S.W., Jan. 12, 1889.
My Dear Sir, —Your wonderful Tonic has done me
more good than years of doctors’ treatment, and has
restored me to perfect health. For years I suffered
from nervous debility and its usual string of
accompanying ailments; sometimes I would be
despondent and melancholy, at others would have
torturing neuralgia, or nervous headaches, sometimes
I would be quite worn out, tired and weak, and unable
to work. I awoke in the morning with tired, aching
limbs, swollen feeling in the eyes, as if they would
burst, sometimes headache and frequent nausea and
vomiting of mucous-like green matter, and various
unpleasant symptoms. Although prejudiced against
proprietary medicines, I determined to try your Tonic
and Dr. Fletcher’s Pills. 1 took two pills every
alternate night, and a tablcspoonful of Tonic an hour
before each "mealtime and, in three days, I began to
improve, and am now quite well. 1 took seven large
bottles of Tonic and two boxes of pills ; my constipation
is quite cured, and 1 feel stronger and healthier than
ever before. Wishing you every success,
I am, yours respectfully,
MARY WALLET.
Neuralgia and Nervous Debility.
Newcastle, N.S.W., Dee. 15, 1SSS.
Mr. F. M. Clements, Newtown.
Dear Sir,— For the last seven years 1 have been a
victim to the most excruciating agony from neuralgia,
and also suffered from extreme nervousness. (tried
hundreds of so-called specifics, but without avail, and,
being a commercial traveller, am particularly liable to
colds from exposure to draughts, &c. ; a slight one
even always fled to my facial nerves, and caused acute
neuralgic pains, preventing sleep and causing excessive
sympathetic headache. I saw your Tonic advertised,
p'rocurcd a bottle and, in two days, the pain was
completely cured, a consummation 1 had never
expected, and am deeply thankful for same. This was
four months ago and from them till now I have never
had the slightest twinge of the excruciating torture I
used to have. You may make what use of this you
like.
Yours gratefully,
HENRY A. CRANE.
Debility from over Brainwork.
Kangaroo Valley, N.S.W., Aprils, ’89.
Dear Sir,— I have very much pleasure in bearing-
witness to the great value of “Clements’ Tonic ’ in
cases of Lassitude, Nervousness and Constitu-
tional Debility generally. For more than 12
months I was a martyr to extreme lassitude, loss of
appetite, sleeplessness, and their concomitant train of
physical troubles, so much so, that I feared 1 should
have to abandon my profession as a journalist, writing
being particularly irksome and laborious to me. 1
tried several advertised tonics (?) with little or no
good result, and began to think my case beyond the
power of medicine to cure. However, seeing your
Tonic advertised in some of my Exchanges, I con-
cluded to try it as a “dernier resort”; and I am
pleased to say the result was most satisfactory. After
taking one bottle I found my appetite much improved ;
I could sleep more soundly, and felt refreshed next
morning. 1 continued the medicine, taking in all
six large bottles, and gradually all my distressing
symptoms disappeared. I now feel myself stronger
than ever, and as near perfect health as a man who has
to bear the strain of constant literary work can expect
to be. I can confidently recommened Clements’
Tonic to all persons suffering from loss of nerve force
through sickness or mental overwork, and am most
happy to support my testimony with my signature.
And remain, dear Sir,
Your faithfully,
P. JEFFERSON WALLACE,
Editor and Proprietor “ Kangaroo Valley Pioneer.’
—- Exhaustion.
75 King Street, Sydney, March 19, ’89.
Mr. F. Moore Clements,
. . Newtown.
Dear Sir,—Kindly send me two more bottles of
Clements’ Tonic, and permit me to express my
t hanks and gratitude at the results obtained by taking
t wo large bottles. I had had a great amount of business
worry to contend against which, together with the long
hour's 1 had stuck to it, completely undermined m,\
constitution, and made me feel very tired, weak and
ill, my nerves being quite shattered. I was so nervous
that the .accidental slamming of a door would cause
me to start violently, my heart would boat very
rapidly, and I would break out in a profuse perspira-
tion, afterwards having a sensation of extreme weak-
ness, lasting for some hours; my sleep at night was
disturbed ; I awoke in the morning with headache
and aching limbs, and quite unrefreshed. I had no
appetite, no strength, and no inclination to work, and
was completely run out. I was persuaded by your
advertisements to try Clements’ Tonic, and am a
different man ever since ; it gave mo new health and
strength, increased my appetite, and made me relish
my food ; I increased in flesh, I lost all nervous feelings,
and now feel stronger than ever, and am glad to bear
testimony to the value of your wonderful remedy.
Yours, &c.,
W. D. BRAHAM.

Dear Sirs,—
I have used the Eucalypte Extract which
I got from you, and am now quite out of it.
Almost every possible complaint 1 used it for,
including burns, scalds, cuts, bruises, sore throats,
colds, chilblains,, neuralgia, toothache; &c., &c.,
and I do not believe there is any disease it
will not cure if persevered withFor ulcerated sore
throat or inflamed throat it is invaluable, having
had personal experience of the fact very recently.
When children, or even adults, are badly effected
1 usually erect a kind of a small tent near the fire-
place, place a kettle on the fire, and when the
water reaches boiling-point .1 pour a quantity of
the Eucalypte Extract into the kettle and attach a
long tube to the spout of the kettle, and make the
steam play about the patient in the tent. The
steam, owing to the distance it has to travel, when
it reaches the patient, is thus in a cool form, and
is not enervating like hot steam. The whole
atmosphere in the tent in this manner becomes
impregnated with the volatile properties of the
extract, and the patient is not only relieved, but
stimulated. I have by this means “ saved the life
of one of my children when the medical atten-
dants said that the only chance of saving the
child’s life would be by performing the operation
of tracheotomy.” In diphtheria I would adopt a
similar treatment, with the addition of swabbing
the tonsils and glotis frequently with the Extract
on a camel’s hair brush or feather. Nearly
everyone here now uses the Extract, and I never
cease to recommend it.—Faithfully yours,
J. O. Ryai l, Editor Cowra Free Press.
Cowra, August 16, 1888.
Gentlemen, —
Eight or nine years ago my wife injured her
her right wrist by a fall. None of the medical men
to whom she showed it appeared to know what
was really wrong with it, and all the remedies ap
plied seemed to be insufficient. She continued
to use various remedies until about six months
ago, when the hand and wrist became ulcerated
nearly to the elbow from the knuckles, and each
time the dressing was removed the skin was torn
off with it, and it was feared she would be obliged
to have her arm amputated. At the same time
her general health was so impaired by constant
suffering, loss of rest, and an affection of the lungs,
which had reduced her to a mere skeleton, that
she had been unable to leave the house for thirteen
weeks, gradually sinking, until scarcely able to
speak, and only kept up by a spoonful of brandy
administered now and then; unable to sleep at
night without also taking brandy, which only gave
her rest for about an hour.
The clergyman, imagining she could only last
for a few days, read the prayers for the dying. I
heard, through Mrs. James Brown, your Bake
Bathurst agent, of your Eucalypte Oil and Victory
Ointment, but Mrs. B. at the same time stated
that she feared my wife was too far g'one for cure.
However, I tried it, and from then, and from the
time my wife began to take the Oil and use the
Ointment, she gradually rallied until she had
recovered her usual health, and three weeks ago
she was able to drive into Lake Bathurst, a dis-
tance of ten miles, and her arm is so well she can
write letters and do sewing, both of which were
matters of impossibility for some months past.
All pain even has ceased; only a slight redness
remains, which is gradually passing off. She still
continues taking the Oil and using the Ointment.
. I consider this one of the most wonderful tes-
timonies to your Eucalypte Oil and Ointment.
Make whatever use you like of this statement,
Chas. G. Smith.

Bathurst
We, the undersigned, believe the above to be
a true account of Mrs. Smith’s case.

rick D. Badgery, J.P.; Sarah Brown.
Dear Sirs,—
I think it my duty to give you a testimonial
lor your Eucalypte Oil and Ointment. On Novem-
ber 24 I was attacked with sciatica and inflamma-
tion in the veins of ray leg, and from that time up
to March I never had peace or comfort, but
plenty of pain and agony, and compelled to keep
my bed part of my time, whilst at other times I
tried to crawl about upon crutches. Indeed my
life was a misery to me. At last I was advised to
consult Mr. Colemane, of Gootamundra, and on
February 27 I went to him, and placed myself
under his Eucalypte Oil Treatment on March 2,
and from that day to this I have never suffered
from any further pains, but, on the contrary, have
kept on improving in health, and now I really
believe I am perfectly cured, solely by the
Eucalypte Oil. I am able to go about my work as
usual, during the past week, without either stick
or crutch. I can highly recommend your Euca-
lypte Oil to be kept in every house, as it is a
specific for colds, wind in the stomach, toothache,
and neuralgia. The Ointment, too, for any kinds
of sores, cannot be beaten. For horses with sore
shoulders it is also invaluable. Now, Gentlemen,
you can use this testimony in any way you may
desire. My statements are perfectly true, and
will be verified on application to me.—I am, Gen-
tlemen, yours respectfully,
John Woodridge.

THESE WORKS have been erected at large
cost for the purpose 9f treating auriferous-
bearing stone of every description.
The application of chlorine gas for the saving of
gold hitherto known to exist in refractory ores
(but unworkable and unpayable by the old process
of treatment) opens up a new field to gold-mining,
and is calculated to give fresh impetus to the
development of the auriferous industries of the
colonies.
These Works will supply a long-felt want, and
the directors feel assured that their efforts to pro-
vide the means of testing ores will be generally
appreciated.
Ores in quantities not less than one ton will
treated by the latest known scientific methods,
and a full report and assay given by competent
experts on each parcel.
The Works (which comprise the most modern
gold saving appliances for amalgamating and
chlorination, together with a complete assay and
analytical labatory) will be under the immediate
direction of Mr. T. D. Merton, who has success-
fully worked and developed an extensive and

Notes on Recent Literature.
■»
Edna LyalTs last novel, “ A Hardy Norse-
man,” in three volumes, was received by post,
direct from London, at the Sydney School of
Arts before any bookseller in Sydney had
seen it.
Cress well’s latest, “ My , Lord Othello,”
came to hand at the School of Arts Lending
library in the same way.
A three-volume novel is published in Lon-
don at 3 Is. 6d. Every new novel of merit i$
received by first mail from London, and the
members of the Sydney School of Arts have
the advantage of reading all of them for only
5s. per quarter.
“Robert Elsmere ” is still in great demand,
■and loses nothing by age. A large number
•of copies have been added to the School of
Arts Library, in order that members might
not be kept waiting.
A box for “ Popular Books Wanted ” has
been placed in the School of Arts Library,
and has been found a great success. Any
member finding a difficulty in obtaining a
book simply puts the title of the work and
his name in the box, and the first time a
copy comes in it is held back for the applicant.
Prof. Momerie’s works are in great demand.
These comprise “Agnosticism,” “Belief in
God,” “ Inspiration,” etc., and are written in
an exceedingly broad, liberal spirit, thoroughly
in keeping with the advanced thought of the
Country book-readers have now the privi-
lege of using the Lending Library of the
Sydney School of Arts, as books are sent
wherever railway carriage is possible. Full
particulars will be sent to anyone enclosing a
stamped addressed envelope to the Secretary,
Sydney School of Arts, 275 Pitt-street.
Over 50 English and American magazines
.<re received every month at the School of
Arts, Sydney.
The Reading-room of the Sydney School
of Arts is 100ft. long and 30ft. wide, and
contains all the latest leading American and
English magazines and newspapers, and with
the intercolonial and local journals covers a
large amount of reading matter.
“The Queen” costs 42s. per annum;
'‘The Lady” costs 15s. per annum; “The
Ladies’ Pictorial ” costs 26s. per annum ;
“The Woman’s World” costs 12s. per annum.
Ladies can see and read all these at the
Sydney School of Arts for 5s. per quarter.
“ Cleopatra,” by Rider Haggard, is a novel
full of interest, and, contrary to the experi-
ence of most novels, is more in demand now
than when it was first published.
Many readers will not peruse a book unless
they know something of the author, conse-
quently such really good American authors
as William Dean Howells, Frank R. Stockton
and some others are comparatively little read.
All the works issued by these two writers are
in the School of Arts Library.
A very excellent biography of General
Boulanger has just been received at the
School of Arts, Sydney.
“ Rita ” has a very high place in the esti-
mation of book-readers. Her latest novel,
‘ ‘ Sheba,” was received at the School of Arts,
Sydney, within a few weeks of publication in
London.
The Sydney School of Arts is not the
stuffy, old-fashioned institution many people
believe it to be. It has lately been reno-
vated ; old and mutilated books replaced
with new ones, the rooms enlarged, and
every week an average of thirty new books
are added to its shelves.
A very comfortable reading-room for the
use of lady members is to be found at the
Sydney School of Arts.
There are 40,000 books nowin the Sydney
School of Arts, and five shillings wall entitle
anyone to the use of the whole of them.
The Sydney Herald, in bound volumes,
from No. 1, is to be seen at the Sydney
School of Arts.
The large catalogue of 30,000 books issued
by the Sydney School of Arts is a most use-
ful encyclopedia of literature, as it gives the
title, author, date of publication, and number
of volumes of each book. It is also arranged
under subjects, so that any book can be
easily found. It can be posted to any ad-
dress for 21 penny stamps.
“ Circuit Journeys—1837-1854,” by the
well-known Judge Cockburn, has just been
received, and is highly spoken of by those
who have read it.
“ Marooned,” by Clark Russell, although
a highly-improbable story, is most interest-
ing. A number of copies are in circulation
at the School of Arts.
“Darrel Blake,” by Lady Colin Campbell,
is so highly praised by the English literary
journals that enquiries for it are rapidly in-
creasing.
Miss Braddons new novel, “The Day
Will Come,” is in circulation at the Sydney
School of Arts.
The Smoking-room in the Sydney School
of Arts is supplied with a large number of
the latest papers and magazines ; several
games, such as draughts, chess, etc., are to
be found on the tables.
Three farthings a day is the rate of sub-
scription to the Sydney School of Arts, or,
in other words, 5s. for three months. No
nomination is required, and the subscription
can commence at any time. Full particulars,
setting forth all advantages, can be had from
the Secretary, School of Arts, 275 Pitt-
street, Sydney.

A Wonderful Remedy.
MARSHALL’S TONIC NERVINE
Is now Universally Acknowledged to be a wonderful
Remedy for Nervous and General Debility, Nervous
Prostration, Torpidity of the Liver, Indigestion, Palpit-
ation of the Heart, Nervous Headache, Diabetes, Lassitude,
Impaired Nutrition, Neuralgia, Hypochondria, Loss of
Energy, and Appetite, Female Complaints, Dizziness,
Noises in the Head and Ears, Loss of Vital Power, Alcholic
Craving, Premature Decline, Impoverished Blood, Im-
paired Sight and Memory, Consumption in its early stages,
Effects of Youthful Indiscretions, Mania, and all diseased
conditions of the system preceding from Deficiency of
Nerve Force. A few doses speedily afford relief, whilst a
course effects a permanent cure. Innumerable instances
emphatically testify to the truth of this statement.
Thousands of testimonials invite the afflicted to test it for
themselves.
Each Drop is Worth a Drop of Gold.
There is no remedy like Marshall’s Tonic Nervine for
Female Complaints. Every female should have a
bottle ready at hand, because for Irregularities, etc.,
it surpasses all others. As the nervous system is the
main-spring of human vigor and healthful regularity,
so where this complicated organism is deranged, Marshall’s
Tonic Nervine acts with a precision and curative effect
like the day spring dispersing the shades of night. The
whole organic system which depends upon the nerves for
its streams of electric force is recuperated and renewed
with th s Great Vitaliser. The muscles rebound with the
energy of youth, appetite and healthful condition follow.
The skin becomes bright and clear, and the winter of
disease’is made summer by the glorious sun of health;
Thousands of restored patients everywhere gladly support
the forcible truth of these assertions, and one trial will
render certainly doubly sure.
Marshall’s Tonic Nervine
Is sold by all Chemists and Storekeepers, and is
ONLY PREPARED BY
MARSHALL BROTHERS,
410, George Street, Sydney.
N.B.—In consequence of spurious imitations of “Tonic
Nervine,” which are calculated to deceive the public
Marshall Bros, have to request that purchasers see that
the Label on every bottle bears their signature, thus—
without which no bottle is genuine. Ask for Marshall’s
Tonic Nervine and see that you get it. Trade mark;
“Tonic Nervine.”

AMERICAN WALTHAM WATCHES.
Best Timekeepers in the World.
Have obtained GOLD MEDALS and FIRST PRIZES at every International Exhibition where they have competed
against the COMBINED MAKERS OF THE WORLD.
The AMERICAN WALTHAM WATCHES are constructed upon the soundest principle of horological art
and of the very best materials throughout ; they are adapted to stand the wear and tear of a lifetime, and are not
liable to get out of order.

watches in the world can be obtained with “Logan’s” Celebrated Breguet Springs, the patent for same being the exclusive
property of the American Waltham Watch Co.
All parts of Waltham Watches are constructed upon the interchangeable system, whereby repairs can be effected in any part
of the world where Waltham Watches are sold as effectually as at the Factory in Waltham, Mass., US. A.

The ’Ouse that Hi Built!
OR HARLEQUIN FEE-FI-FEDERATION AND THE
FAIRY BULLETIN.
A CHRISTMAS PANTOMIME IN FOUR
SCENES.
(BY EDMUND FISHER. )
CHARACTERS:
Sir Airyparks, the Great Hi Ham of Jobberland.
Tincan-billys, Hi Ham’s rival—with iveakness for
Hc-bes.
The Fairy Bulletin, a great and good Genius.
Grovel Gnome, a fiend having special designs on
Jobberland.
Yorney, Sorney, Jorney I
Horney and Newborney /
Five foolish Princes
of Jobberland.
Societania, Cupbearer to the Princes.
Stella, a Mountain Nymph in love with Airyparks.
Good Fairies, Gnomes, Reptiles, Soldiers, Insects,
Aides-de-camp, Ac.
Scene I.—A sylvan valley in Jobberland. Elderly
Fairies reclining upon heaps of artificial leaves,
and taking deep draughts of air from goblets
of purest pasteboard.
Opening Chorus.
See the Southern Cross is blinking!
One by one the stars appear—
Nothing from these cups we’re drinking,
Would that they were full of beer;
Night has drawn her sombre curtain
Round the nests of dozing birds—
Warble what we will, it’s certain
No one tries to catch the words—
(Piano) Catch the words—
(Very fat and forte) Catch the words.
Enter the Fairy Bulletin.
Fairy B. —
Sweet fairies all, of every size and age—
(Aside) What shocking objects do the Firm engage!
I looks towards you. (Drains an empty goblet and
smacks her lips. Then lets goblet fall with
sickening thud.)
Ah ! my heart it cheers
To see you here again. You knows ’tis years
Since first I met you in this very valley.
(Aside) All folks seem mortal save the fairy ballet.
No matter, to get on with my remarks,
I much mistrust this windy Airyparks ;
Once more he rides the high, untamed steed,
Great things to do in hottest haste indeed.
Long time he snorted at the babbling dreams
Of such as mooted Federation schemes,
Now, in a trice, he tries, with senile blather
To jump the style of “ Federation Father.”
His rash career it is my cue to stop.
First Fairy—
Then send for Stella from the mountain’s top ;*
Her lovely arms around his knees entwined,
No more he’ll feel uneasy in his mind;
When Cupid’s tart has pierced the Great Hi Ham
He’ll think of nothing but his bit of jam—
Fairy B.—
Well thought of ! She shall mash the ardent
feller.
F. Fairy —
Come, girls, I know the damsel’s haunt— let’s tell
her.
(They totter off as fast as their infirmities will
permit.)
Fairy Bulletin muses to slow music, then ad-
vances slowly to the footlights.
Song.
Aid me, O Spirits of Freedom and Right,
Never desert me from morning till night.
Guide me and guard me, for aye in thy care—
One on each side of the Editor’s chair.
Let my adherents by thousands increase—
Hasten the hour when grovel shall cease—
Till down in the dale or atop of the crag,
Men’s Standard of Thought is the Red-covered
Rag.
Tioo bottle-nosed females are lowered from the
flies by wires so invisible that a blind man could
spot ’em at half-a-mile. These spirits of F. and B.
kiss Fairy Bulletin’s forehead. As they are re-
ascending all the Fairies return with Stella, who
ivears black tights for her lost love, Airyparks.
Grand Ballet, and change to
Scene 2.—Grovel-Gnome’s home in the purlieus
of Sheol. Toads, worms, snakes, earwigs, &c.
—in which the souls of dead grovellers have
found refuge—are crawling, twisting and fool-
ing round a boiling cauldron.
Enter Grovel-Gnome.
Song.
I love to bend me low,
I try to kiss the toe
Of all on earth of noble birth—
They take my fancy so.
Chorus of toads, Ac. —They take his fancy so.
The dudeling from abroad
I always have adored,
And, really, I would gladly die
To please a languid lord—
Chorus —To please a languid lord.
I do so dote on blood,
It’s joy to say “ my lud ”;
I’d not rebuke an earl or duke
Who rolled me in the mud.
Chorus — Who rolled him in the mud.
My constant task has been
To grease our Gracious Queen,
And, day by day, I humbly pray
O, dam the Bullyteen !
Chorus —That Sydney Bullyteen.
Good-morrow, subjects— (they abase themselves
before G. Gnome) —glad to see me back ?
I’ve been at rich Pott’s Point and through Toorak.
The drains are bad up there, ’twill not be long
Before you get additions to your throng;
Some G.M.G.’s are looking sick and queer—
We’ll shortly see ’em gee to join us here.
(Peeps into the cauldron and sniffs)
How nice it smells —a noble steYV, forsooth !
What's in it ?
First Toad—
Well, we’ve got a baron’s tooth,
An archduke’s hair-brush and a viscount’s boots,
And ten of Hopetoun’s flunkeys’ left-off suits,
An aide’s old braces —
Grovel-Gnome—
Silence, that’s enough!
I’ll try a lush of this delushious stuff.
(Dips in a pannikin and drinks.)
You might have cut the boots a trifle thicker,
But, oh, ye gods! ’twere hard to lick the liquor.
Here’s to Airyparks! ( takes six tragedy paces for-
ward and dissembles) that rash old poet]
Might do me mischief, if he did but know it.
Now in his haste to win a cheap renown,
He’d let good tricks be collared by the Crown.
I rub my hands already at the thought
Of catching subjects in a Viceroy’s Court.
Ha! ha! come hither all ye crawling things,
And gaily writhe the while your master sings—
I love to bend me low,
I try to kiss the toe —
The stage is suddenly plunged in darkness, the
stage-manager ts heat'd gnashing his teeth at crea-
tion, and the lights are turned up, disclosing
Scene 3. —A Forest in Jobberland. Fairy Bulle-
tin and Stella discovered seated on a log.
Stella (still in black tights)is weeping bitterly.
Presently she wrings her hands and cries
‘ * Alas ! ” which is cue for the orchestra to let
fly. She Yvinks at a chappie in one of the
stage-boxes, and advances.
Song.
Ah ! memory sweet of strange delight,
In days long past, in days long past
You kissed your Stel-la through the night—
It did not last, it did not last;
We wooed up-on the mountain height,
We burning twain, ive burning twain—
O ! ancient love with locks so white,
Come back again, come back again.
( Voices of fairies among trees)—
Soon shall she dry the bitter tear—
Her love is near, her love is near.
Wo sat be-side the rippling brook,
And were content, and were content;
But, woe is me ! your hook you took,
And back you went to Parliament;
You sang my prai-ses in a book
In tend’rest strain, in tend’rest strain,
Upon my bard I long to 100k —
Come back again, come back again.
Invisible Fairies —
No longer need the damsel sigh—
Her love is nigh, her love is nigh.
(Sir Airyparks and Tincan-Billys are seen
approaching in angry altercation. Fairy Bulle-
tin puts her arm round Stella, and they wifldraw
out of view of the new-comers.)
Enter Airyparks and Tincan-billys.
Airyparks—
It cannot be. The scheme, you know, is mine—
I take all credit by my right divine.
Tincan —That you were fond of taking it I knew,
So many men have had an eye o’ you.
Airy—
Unmannered dog ! woulds’t thou insult my white
head ?
Tincan—
Well, let me have a chance, then, to get knighted ;
I want that “ Sir ” upon a date quite early,
You’ve got the “ handle,” prithee, don’t be surly ;
Leave Federation to your “Younger Sister,”
She youngers for the “ fat,” you might assist her.
If you consent, my friend for life I’ll deem yer,
And you can be the new Dominion’s Premier.
Airy—
No, Tincan-billys, by my billet! no—
The great Hi Tlam will run or stop this show.
Duet and Dance : Airy and Tincan,
Airy— I’m great Hi Ham, of Jobberland,
I play my hand alone,
Tincan—Whene’er a likely scheme is planned
He claims it for his own.
Airy— The things I’ve done and those I’ve not
Amount to such an awful lot —
The warmest member you have got
(Together)— Is great Hi Ham.
(Breakdown.)
Airy— If Jobberland would federate
The way I’m bound to show —
Tincan —And like a mad bull at a gate
The Old ’Un means to go.
Airy —• I’ll talk and talk, till all is blue
And the hind-legs off the kangaroo —
Throw up your hats and shout “Hooroo!”
(Together) — For Great Hi Ham.
(Breakdown.)
Enter Fairy Bulletin, Stella, and the remains
of Fairy Ballet. Several of them have been stricken
with paralysis since the opening scene. Stella is
hiding under F.B.’s right wing.
Fairy B.—
Sweet Tincan, and my good Sir Airyparks,
You look quite gloomy for such gay old sparks.
What ails you, that your foreheads wear a frown ?
Tincan—
Peace, mocking: jade ! I mean to put you down ;
You turn the light our “loyal” jobs and tricks on.
I’ll stop you with a Bill by Righteous Wrixon,
A Bill, constructed on a basis novel,
Suppressing papers which would gibe at grovel.
Airyparks (interrupting) —
Do I infer from ravings so infernal
You would suppress the only Federal journal ?
(Everybody laughs except Tincan.)
You don’t know what you’re talking of, old buffer—
’Tis I, not you, who have most blows to suffer.
They’ve stabbed my feelings in a hundred rhymes,
And Hop. has cut me fifteen-thousand times ;
Phil May filled mayny minds with notions ribald,
He drew a blow-fly on the Hi Ham’s eye-ball’d.
Put down The Bulletin ! dear boy, I’m thinkan
’Tis much more likely it will put down Tincan.
(Airy snaps his fingers, and Tincan retires to the
rear scowling.)
Why, Fairy 8., who lurks beneath your wing?
Fairy B.—
A downcast damsel, poor, deserted thing !
She lives alone upon a mountain yonder.
Airy (aside ) —
Who can it be ? It can’t—perhaps—l wonder.
Stella rushes forward and throws herself at the
feet of Airyparks, who hides his emotion in a hand-
kerchief for six seconds, then soliloquises to slow
music.
Airy—
After long years I look upon the girl,
Who erst did put my flowing mane in curl,
With nimble, joyous fingers, pinch my cheek,
And kiss away my protests. I was weak
For but a little while, then stronger grew—
On Duty’s pinions back to work I flew ;
Gave poor old Jack a roaster in the ribs,
And knocked out all who dared “ put up their
Dibbs.”
Heigho ! immersed in trouble, toil, and care
To think of Stella I’d no time to spare;
In dreams, perchance, my longing eyes would gaze
Upon that vision of the halcyon days,
But with the dawn the fitful vision fled,
And Stella was as one for ages dead ;
I loved her, but ’twas better we should part—
Far better, yes, to tear her from my heart
(For narrow are the limits of its space)
And put dear Federation in her place
(He makes a closer inspection of Stella, j
The nymph is wondrous fair, her figure’s neat —
My blood is tingling, and my bosom’s beat
Tells tales that I would fain refuse to hear —
Arise (he tenderly raises Stella to her feet) ; you
have been weeping, child, I fear :
With dews of sorrow are your lashes wet,
Stella—l weep for joy.
Airy (embracing her) —
My sweet, my own, my pet !
('Fairy B. exchanges glances withher attendants.)
The honey of your lips again I taste,
Once more this arm is round your yielding waist.
Delicious nymph, forego thy right to chide,
Affairs of State have kept me from thy side :
And yet, no Federation can compare
With this, the joining of an ardent pair
Who have between them but a single thought;
But I must leave you now, at least, I ought.
My Duty calls, though Beauty cries,
Stella— Don’t go.
Airy —One voice says “Yes,” the other—
Stella — Whispers “No."
Trio—Airyparks, Stella and F. Bulletin,
Airy — I hear the voice of Duty
Calling me aw-a-a-y,
Fairy B. —The warning voice of Duty
Airy — I hear the voice of Beauty
Softly bid me st-a-a-y.
Fairy B.—The luring voice of Beauty
Stella — 0 ! Stay with me for ever
Never quit your Stella’s side
Fairy B.— Be her darling and her pride
Airy— I hear the voice of Duty
(he prepares to fly)
I hear the voice of Beauty
(he prepares to stay).
Twixt my Duty and my Beauty,
Angels, help me to decide.
Stella — 0 ! stay by me forever —
Beauty will not be denied.
Fairy B. —0 ! stay with her for ev-er ;
Airy, Stella,!
and J-
Fairy B. J
With
(Thee!
Me }
t Her J
For-ever.
On the mountain top abide.
(After a lot of looking in the direction of Duty
and then back again at Stella, Airy finally clasps
her to his breast. Fairy B. waves her wand over
their heads, and the Ballet express joy and rap-
ture as well as they can. )
Chorus —He has heard the voice of Beauty,
Or, no doubt, she would have died.
(Booming of cannon, also the tumult of trumpets
and drums, is heard in the distance. Airyparks
and Stella steal away to a shady bower. Tincan-
billys, emerging from obscurity, pricks up his ears
and heaves sighs of satisfaction.)
Fairy B.—
What do I hear—the noise of martial drumming !
The usual warning that our “ nobs ” are coming,
Tincan—
Long live V.R. and every dear vice royal!
(Aside) They ought to knight me, for I’m truly
loyal.
It warms my soul to see a prancing soldier —
Fairy B.—
You seemed in grief until that row con soled ycr;
Now, for myself, I hate these shows absurd,
With which you Tories awe the thoughtless herd;
Each soldier’s drum, I see, I’d like to thump it,
And nothing sets me blasting like a trumpet;
Cocked hats are vanities of which I’m “jack” o’,
And pipe-clay's tommy-rot without tobacco —
Tincan (holding up his hands in horror) —
Such thoughts alarm me, surely you are joking,
You wouldn’t see our fiery warriors smoking ?
Fairy B.—
Ti ncan-ny Scot, you haven’t twigged my meaning.
Your brains are addled by God Save the Queening.
But see ! they come in all their gaudy clobber,
(Addressing Fairies) We’ll stand aloof and watch
this person ( pointing to Tincan) slobber.
(Fairy B. and Ballet fall back in a semi-circle,
while Tincan-billys makes great public demonstra-
tion by leaving his hat. )
Enter Grand Procession of Policemen, Soldiers,
Aides-de-camp, Scotch Retainers, and other
Flunkeys, followed by the Five Princes, with
Societania in attendance. Tincan-billys puts
his hat on the ground and implores PiUNOB New-
BORNEY to use it as a boot-scraper.
Song—the Five Princes.
Five Tories we of high degree,
Men of rank and station,
Sent out to smile in lofty style
Upon the population ;
We dine and sup, attend the Cup,
At balls we cut a caper ;
We do the play in regal way,
And sometimes read the paper
But it’s heavy, awful heavy, doncherknow,
Dweadful bore to hold a levee, doncherknow,
(A ides join in) —Though | 1 | try to keep awake
For our Sovereign Lady’s sake,
It is heavy, awful heavy, doncherknow.
(Repeat)
(Just as song is concluded, Grovel-Gnome,
Toads, Snakes, &c., enter, and pay homage first to
the Princes and then to the Aides.)
Tincan-billys—
Beloved Highnesses, most loyal still you find us,
We wish to tighten up those bonds that bind us
Those “silken bonds” we speak of with such
unction
At each official feed or civic function.
Those silken bonds —my flood of language fails,
Suppose I sing “ God Bless the Prince of Wales.”
(He sings it and resumes)
Beloved Highnesses, I’m old and fat, you see,
And haven’t quite the voice of Lilian Tree,
But still I did as well as I was able—
We’ll send the news to Salisbury by cable,
The country stands the cost. As 1 was saying,
To have those bonds drawn tighter we are praying.
Prince Yorney—
Get on, old chappie, though you do adore us,
And all that sort of thing—you musn’t bore us.
Tincan—
Beloved Highnesses, I crave a little time—
It’s not such easy work to talk in rhyme ;
I ask your kind forbearance while I state
That Jobberland would like to Federate—
And I was thinking—such is my opinion—
WeTnight arrange a King for our Dominion.
(Sensation — Fairy Bulletin smiles.)
Societania (Clapping her hands ) —
A real king ! 0 ! catch me, lam fainting.
Grovel Gnome (whispers to her)—
The kind of king depicted in a painting ;
The sort of monarch seen in verse and story—
A thing of beauty in a blaze of glory.
Tincan—
Beloved Highnesses, I would with your permission,
Suggest you have a “sweep ” for this position ;
Five straws to draw your Highnesses I’ll bring,
And he who draws the shortest straw is King.
(Grand flourish of trumpets.)
I’ll get them, and return in half a minute.
(Rushes off to look for straws.)
P. Yorney —
Who’ll lay me 4 to 1 in “ ponies ” I don’t win it ?
Or, apey thought! I’ll take the odds in “ monkeys."
P. Newborney—
The price is fair, but why not bet in flunkeys ?
I’ve got a lot, they came out in the Rome
Together with my suite, from “ Home, sweet
Home”;
Fine footmen, thirty inches and a-half
They measure (with the padding) round the calf.
P. SORNEY—
They can’t beat me, I’m beautifully built—
You never saw a man more “ killing ” in a kilt.
Yorney (aside) —
All right, deah boy, in flunkeys, then, we’ll book it—
I’ll work a swindle —get Tincan to “ cook ” it.
Fairy B.—
Not quite so fast; I’ve heard your conversation,
Without Hi Ham there can’t be Federation-
First catch your kingdom, ere you get your king.
Grovel Gnome—
Upon that saucy minx I’d like to spring
And stop her clatter in a summary fashion :
She puts me in a most outrageous passion ;
’Twere joy to euchre such a cunning joker —
Here, someone, hold me back, or 1 shall choke her.
Fairy B. (contemptuously to the Five Princes)—
Your game is high, I’m very grieved to “ nark” it—
But don’t you “ run before your horse to market,”
As G. 0. Miln observes, in Richard Crook-back ?
P. Horney—
The jade is right, our plans are rather took back,
But with a view to pushing things along
I’ll throw ’em off a Patriotic Song—
(Sings)—Unfurl the flag, and let it wave
For evermore o’er Freedom’s grave ;
We’ll have the land, from coast to coast,
Upon a bit of loyal toast.
P. Yorney —
Do stop, deah boy, or we shall all be dozers
( Yawning) —In truth you are the greatest of com-
posers.
Societania —
I call it grand, directly we get back
That song will be the fashion at Toorak,
Where every maiden, with a weak soprano,
Sings Horney’s ballads to her Pa’s piano.
(Enter Sir Airyparks and Stella.)
P. Yorney—
Haw ! herd’s Hi Ham —now where have you beei
hiding ?
We’ve sighed for you—some question wants de
ciding.
Good Tincan-billys a scheme has been -uggesting,
I can’t explain, but, haw ! it’s intere-. .ng.
You’ll find out all about it when he’s o en you,
And then, of course, you’ll fix it up I.. Tween you.
A doosid pwetty girl ( turns eye-glass on Stella)
where did you find it?)
♦And on the Rocky Mountains’ height,
Eight thousand feet above the sea, love,
My Stella kissed me through the night,
Yes, darling, thou wert with mo, love.

Other Poems "

Hopkins and Phil. May. One shilling: mailed

successful book ever printed South of the Equator,
Airyparks—
Enough that this is mine , you needn’t mind it.
Grovel Gnome [aside) —
This must be looked to, for, methinks, there’s
danger
When to his chest ne strains this lovely stranger ■
She likes it, too, I saw her blush and tremble— '
No matter, in the meantime I’ll dissemble
[He dissembles to himself.)
P. Yorney —
I never said she wasn’t yours, old chappie
I wish you joy, and hope you’ll both be happy,
Believe me, I would use no machinations
To steal your mash that’s pure imashination.
Airy—■
Of course not—certainly—l mean I didn’t think—
P. Yorney—
Just so—exactly—s’pose we have a drink,
The air to-day is doosid close and tropical—
And, while we booze, you sing us something
topical.
[Trumpets. Soldiers present arms while the
flunkeys and Societania serve refreshments to the
Princes and Aides. Scotch retainers blow bagpipes
behind Newbornby as he lowers a lemon-squash.)
Topical Song— Airyparks.
I’m about to sing a song—
Don’t believe it :
When I pitch it rather strong—
Don’t believe it:
If they say these wretched rhymes
People write for pantomimes
Should be punishable crimes,
Don’t believe it.
When you hear a parson preach,
Don’t believe it.
That your heart he wants to reach,
Don’t believe it;
(For I know the ways of such
Having lived among them much) —
’Tis your pocket he would touch,
Don’t believe it.
Is Parkes a vain old file ?
Don’t believe it;
Did he rather makes us smile,
Don’t believe it.
When the other day he came,
Taking up his neighbours’ claim
To this Federation fame?
Don’t believe it.
Shall we leave off hanging men ?
Don’t believe it.
Would the world be better then ?
Don’t believe it.
Without our “ sick’ning thud,”
And the “ horrid ‘ swish ’ of blood,”
Could we get along ? O lud !
Don’t believe it.
Does the Mayor of Melbourne snort,
Don’t believe it.
When, on jewels knights import—
Don’t believe it—
To adorn exalted necks,
He discovers we annex
Benny’s “dummy ” Duty cheques 1
Don’t believe it.
Of a scandal have you heard—
Don’t believe it—
Which in London has occurred ?
Don’t believe it.
Do the “traps ” who find a peer
Doing dirty things—O ! dear —
Let the titled sinner “ clear ” ?
Don’t believe it.
[Enter Tincan-billys, mopping his loyal brow.)
Tincan—
For these five straws I’ve had a most absurd quest,
[Aside) To tell the truth, I stole ’em from a bird’s
nest ;
[To Princes) Now, will your Royal Highnesses be
pleased to draw ?
P. Yorney—
You’d better see Sir Airyparks first—haw !
Tincan (to Airy)—
I want you to agree to this, my little scheme,
For realising Tmcan’s fondest, brightest dream.
Airy [storming) —
What have you to disclose to Great Hi-Ham ?
Before ’tis said you’ll get my answer—“dam.”
1 don’t agree; lam not i’ the vein ;
Tincan, avaunt! ye threaten here in vain,
borne bits of straw your hands, I see, have stuck
in ’em—
Odds life! go to —so much for shallow Buckingham!
Without consulting me you dare engage in
Some flimsy scheme, no wonder I’m a-ragein’—
You hurt my pride, you tread upon my bunion—
Tincan [aside)
I fear the sage is fairly off his “onion.”
Airy—
Speak, man, before my heart I further harden.
Tincan [greasily) —
Well, we’ve been thinking, in the Cabbage
Garden—
Your Younger Sister had this inspiration
How well a King would crown our Federation.
So these five straws I hastened to obtain—
The Prince who draws the shortest is to reign ;
We’ll hail him as our Monarch, by the Grace,
Put palaces galore about the place,
Have dukes, and marquises, and earls in plenty :
If Prince Newborney (who is under twenty)
Should draw the prize, most likely, don’t you see,
He’d live to have a Royal Jubilee.
Airy—
Don’i you believe it; on the job I’m not—
Your mind’s diseased and you are talking rot,
[General sensation. The Five Princes say ‘ ‘ Haw /”"
and become very limp.)
Cincan [pleadingly)—
The I ederation plan we’ll say is all your own— f
You take that glory—let me build a Throne,
(Grovel Gnome and attendants abase themselves
before the Great Hi Ham, but he merely folds his
arms and snorts.)
Airy—
Of this vain folly I desire no more,
My answer’s “ dam,” as I remarked before,
ru f , am Ham has ever hated you
1 hold you cheap, and, therefore, lof I rated you.
P. Yorney—
But I say, chappie, this is most unkind —
Upon my soul, you mustn’t change your mind.
(Stella throws her arms round Airy.)
G. Gnome [Aside) —
"Hie artful wench has got him in her toils,
tk.Ti v v S^l f wheedles, Grovel’s game she spoils,
■that bit of goods ” a dam-sel I should call—
l guess she’s not a bit of good at all.
Tincan—
Your Highnesses, I’m filled with consternation,
bo long I\g fed on thoughts of Federation—
All, all, destroyed by Airyparks’s malice is— *
G. Gnome—
My pal has ordered fifteen royal palaces.
SOCIETANIA—
And I so longed to be a Maid of Honour,
Tincan ( sympathetically )—
Dis mayed she is since this blow fell upon her.
Airy—
Come Stella, we will to the Mountain go ;
Let Jobberland preserve its status quo.
Vv hen I withdraw with thee, I’ll be(e) no drone,
-But still control my House by telephone.
Io I airy Bulletin ( tickling the Fairy's chin ) I owe.

i do beseech thee not to grant “ reprieves,”
But, ni the sacred name of Saint Mount Rennie !

And now, in peace and love, we twain depart.
(Aim parks and Stella make an impressive
exit to slow music. Societania tears her hair,
J. incan and Grovel-Gnome weep on each other's
shoulders. Soldiers and flunkeys fall back in broken-
W disorder. The Five Princes after a very feeble
flaw, fall into a further state of collapse. The
tames cluster together smiling and nodding to the
happy pair.)

And now this fay (points to Fairy B.) has made

You,recollect how Beerthirst got a “ plugg- r, ”
Because he lost, and couldn’t find the shugger.
P. Newborney—
Though Tincan, doncherknow, of course desponds,
He did his best to tighten up the bonds;
\V hen my twelve private secs, to Knutsford write,
Attempt to add a line about that title.
Song and Chorus—( Everybody .)
Five Princes —Five Tories we of high degree,

For our Sovereign Lady’s sake—
It is heavy, awful heavy, doncherknow.

Fairy B.—
Methinks there’s little more to sing or say :
Tincan, continue to hold greasy sway
Within your limits, while Newborney strives
To act the Monarch when abroad he drives
(Having been told that flunkey plush air; powder
Make toadies yell “ God Save the Queen ” the
louder),
While honest toilers mock the “ green ” young
fellow
Disporting in barouche of blue and yellow.
Bid bells ring out from new Cathedra 1 steeple,
But, ere he’s king, don’t let him say “My people, n
As Sorney did ; if rumour be voracious
That little slip gave umbrage to Her Gracious.
Societania, slobber, gush, and fawn
On every fool to wealth and “ honours ” born,
Get creeds, as well as dresses, out from “ Home
And you uphold her always, Grovel Gnome;
Strive, day and night, to raise an “ upper-crust,”
To blind the People’s eyes with golden dust —
To drag down Manhood to the very dust
You, perfumed Princes, will I scarce upbraid;
You play your parts, and quarterly are paid ;
Your office, more than person, do I “ slate ; ”
You serve the Queen, I try to serve the State
(The real State—the many, not th efctv) —
Like you, I’m working with an end in view;
I tell plain facts, and you’ve your yarns to spin—|
“ God Save us AH ! ” says Fairy Bulletin.
Kind friends in front, deal gently with the verse
(This Christmastide you’ll have to swallow worse.)
Think, if the metre halts as you recite it,
Though wrong it be, ’twas weary work to write it.
(Fairy Bulletin and Ballet, bathed in lime-
light, retire backwards in the direction of mountain

graded objects at live “bob” a week. An opening
appears at extreme back of forest—disclosing view of

Kindness to Birds.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
(Respectfully Dedicated to the Australian Dicky-
Bird Society.)
“ Pledge of Membership of the Australian Dickt-
Bird Society. —l hereby promise to be kind to all living
things, to protect them to the utmost of my power, and
never to take or destroy a bird’s nest or its eggs. I also
promise to get as many boys and girls as possible to join
the Australian
Picky-Bird Society,
and to do all I can
to induce them to
faithfully keep this
pledge.”
E kind to the
Dicky - bird,
study his
whims,
And assist him
to feather his
nest;
Whether inside
the tree or
on one of its
limbs,
Let him build
it where’er
he thinks
best.
Be kind to the ostrich, emu, and rnooruk,
To the fork-tailed fly-catcher, and rail;
To the ternate kingfisher when down on his luck,
And don’t tread on the lyre-bird’s tail.
Be kind to the mocking-bird, feed him on “chaff,”
Be kind to the quaint jabiru ;
Be kind to the jackass and join in his laugh,
Notwithstanding the “ laugh ” be on you.
Be kind to the hobby, the magpie and shrike,
Be kind to the chick-a-dee-dee,
Be kind to the woodpecker out on a “ strike,”
And a-tapping the Old Beech Tree.
Be kind to the puffin, the grebe, and the auk,
To the pelican, penguin, and gull;
Be kind to the parrot —don’t mind his small talk,
For his life at the best must be dull.
Be kind to the hermit-bird, leave him alone,
Be kind to the wagtail and snipe;
And don’t shoot the albatross just for the bone
Of his wing for a stem to your pipe.
Be kind to the goose and the gander, her mate —
If you’re partial to goose let me tell
How that sauce for the latter when served on your
plate.
Is sauce for the gander as well.
Be kind to the noddy and lesser pee-wit,
Be kind to the chough and the crow;
To the sprightly tomtit and the meadow pit-pit,
And be kind to the doubtful dodo.
Be kind to the buzzard and Bobby O’Link,
And don’t even hoot at the owl ;
And don’t offer spirits or other strong drink
To a virtuous cold-water fowl.
Be kind to the dab-chick, the jackdaw, and jay,
And smile on the herpetotheres,
And don’t rob the wild ocyphops of his prey,
Nor worry the eutoxeres.
Be kind to the purple-capped lory, my child,
Be kind to the yellow macaw,
Be kind to the cockatoo —don’t make him wild,
Or he’ll give you too much of his jaw.
Beikind to the stork and don’t collar his egg,
Be courteous, be generous, be fair ;
Ef Ihe’s weary of standing too long on one leg
Be ready to offer a chair.
HOP.
“Nelly.”
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
She was very pretty. All Nellies are.
She had silky-brown hair with a charming ripple
in it; beautiful hazel eyes, and long, delicate ears.
She was a retriever. And she belonged to Penn.
Penn—nobody knew him by any other name—
was immeasurably the inferior animal, being a
drunken old Cornishman. He was a “hatter”—
partly by choice, for his disposition was surly and
solitary, and partly because no mate had ever been
able to put up with his ingrained crabbedness.
“Seems to me that old Penn’s the sourest old
• on the field,” said Jimmy Squareface, of the
Miner’s Arms ; drunk or sober, it don’t make no
difference in him. And nobody ever seed him
shout, no matter how tight he got. My ’pinion of
old Penn is, he’s no blank good !”
And this opinion was held and expressed, more
or less profanely, by everyone except Nelly on
Mick’s diggings.
# # *
And Nelly? Why, to her, Penn was the
embodiment of all that was noble, and grand, and
estimable, in mankind. She loved the very clay-
stained moleskins he wore—and even their sup-
porting belt, which the old sinner only took off to
“ leather ” her with. And the more he leathered
her, the more she clung to him and fawned on him,
and snapped at all who came near him, when
Nelly’s superior wisdom told her that her master
had too much whisky aboard to be able to look
after himself. And her affections were absolutely
undivided. Distantly polite she was, as long as
you kept clear of Penn, but “ sudden and quick
in quarrel ” if you so much as approached him.
Nelly was otherwise useful to her master. Penn
did not keep a housemaid ; and Nelly, recognising
this deficiency in the domestic economy, supplied
the want to the best of her ability. When
Penn finished a meal he set his plate and
pannikin on the floor before Nelly, and she
polished them as brightly as could any scullery -
maid in the country. Then Penn, who knew cl-
eared nothing about hydatid cysts, put his dishes
away in the gin-case which served him for a table,
and all was ready for the next meal.
But the greatest service that Nelly rendered
Penn was the care she took of him when he went
on one of his periodical “sprees.” I think she
used to be rather surprised that the object of her
affections should become so helpless and stupid ;
but she only increased her attentions, and tended
him with truly feminine care. She would try
every possible plan to induce him to come home,
and when these had all proved futile she would
guard him from the approach of all-comers with
the most determined vigilance. Penn was a hardy
old villain, and always stubbornly refused to
sleep at the pub. Whatever the weather, he would
go to the big gum-tree outside the yard and beneath
it, on the bare ground, he would camp. He never
troubled himself about blankets, was asleep after
about two and-a-half minutes’ all-round, impartial
cursing; and evolved a snore of intense pro-
fundity. In the morning he would awake, curse,
brush the frost from his beard, kick Nelly, and
resume his spree with a moroseness that seemed
inseparable from him, and with a total absence ot
enthusiasm. This would last as long as Penn’s
money did. When that was all gone, and
the publican chillingly refused to “chalk it ” to
any satisfactory extent, Penn, nolens volens,
sobered up.
* * *
“ I m goin’ home,” said Penn to the land-
lord. “ Give us a bottle.” His hands shook, his
face was flushed, he muttered uneasily to himself
at times, and cast a frightened look around.
Plainly, he was developing a most interesting case
of D.T. ’s. He got the bottle, and started for home.
Nelly’s joy was extravagant. She very nearly
overturned the old man as she leaped upon
him to show her satisfaction. But all she got in
return was a mighty smite from Penn’s horny fist,
as he yelled ;
“ Curse you, get out! You’ve got blood on you !”
This was untrue. But a suspicion that all was
not right with Nelly had arisen in Penn’s mind,
and he was unable to allay it. And the more he
looked at Nelly (she kept at a discreet distance
now) the more abnormal her appearance seemed.
“Where did she get them two heads of hers?”
her master wondered vaguely. But the two heads
were driven quite out of his thoughts by the big
crawfish that were fighting on N elly’s back, and
the death-adders that were tying themselves in
knots round her neck, and making faces at him
all the while. Then what multitudes of strange
birds were flying around her ! She must be dead,
surely, or all those big yellow crows would not be
there ! And yet she couldn’t be dead; either, or she
wouldn’t stand there and grin and put out her
tongue and spit fire at him, as she was doing ! She
was behaving shockingly. He would throw a
stone at her and hunt her away. But when he
stooped for a stone the grass was so full of frogs
with sharp, cruel beaks that he daren’t put his
hand down. He would throw that big rock he
had in his pocket, and which had been such a
burden to him so long. How did it come there,
anyhow? With shaking hand he took out the
bottle of rum and threw it feebly at the dog. But
she only grinned the more, and the snakes round
her neck untwined themselves and came after him.
He would run. He wasn’t goin’ to be bitten by
no death-adders, not he ! But he stubbed his toe
against a stump and hit the ground with his head,
and slept.
# * #
When he awoke it was bright moonlight.
There were not so many snakes about; but his
head was very bad and would not stay with him,
except for a few seconds. Then it would go away,
and when it came back it didn’t seem to fit and
“ jarred ” him. And to think all this misery was
owing to that sanguinary dog ! He would pay
her out for it, that he would !
He pulled himself together, and walked home,
Nelly showing the way inside the hut. She had
got rid of the crawfish and the snakes, Penn
noted. But who could tell when they would
come again and frighten him ? She must be put
out of the way, “ for good.” Penn took the
saddle-strap that served him from his waist.
“ Here, Nelly !” he said.
Nelly came up gladly. Penn lifted her two
forepaws, crossed them on the back of her neck,
and fastened them there with the strap. Then he
lifted her up, and went out towards the creek.
* * *
Trustful old Nelly 1 She didn’t even
whine, so sure was she that one she loved so much
could not harm her. And if she lost her faith as
she went under, she never came to the top to say so.
# # *
Penn recovered, of course, in a few days.
He always did. But he was too hardened an old
ruffian to be sorry for what he had done ; and,
indeed, he remembered it but dimly. But since
then his crockery has never been cleaned. That
is no great hardship for Penn, however.
He is not fastidious.
AH CHER.


Quog King’s Elopement.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
Qoong Hing was a foreigner—a short, stout,
dark, amiable gentleman of Celestial extraction—
a scion of one of the oldest families in China.
Having been unfortunate in an endeavour to
create a corner in hogs, he was reduced to the
necessity of migrating and establishing himself in
the cabbage trade, in the pursuit of which
honourable calling he circulated about Chines
(Vic.) appearing as a tri-weekly issue, ambling
gaily round between two baskets hung on a stick,
and offering his vegetable wares from door to door
with an old-established smile of wonderful cir-
cumference, a wheedling, hiczzo-mestom intonation,
and a grace of manner well
adapted and calculated to
make impressions and
agitate the sympathies of
compassionate house-
keepers and susceptible
kitchen females of every
age and grade.
# * #
Quong was still young
and of an affectionate,
clinging temperament;
he had conjugality large,
and amativeness swelled
and extending; his face
was like a great, plain,
suety duff in the matter
of complexion and ex-
tent, and his features
were dropped down about
it promiscuously, regard-
less of precedent and
constituted rule; his
mouth swayed away to
the west, and his nose
never hung plumb; his
eyes were set up end-
ways, and his ears
branched out and flopped
like those of a medita-
tive goat; but Quong was
not unlovely, and, having
the instincts of a dude,
he was simply irresistible
when he oiled his bear-
ings, hung out his Sab-
bath pants, and called up
all his resources to charm
the hired maiden or the
boss matron into an in-
vestment in forced
vegetables.

Q. Hing ran an irriga-
tion farm on the bank
of Bircher’s Creek, and
lived back there in
rural seclusion. He had
a small, striped wooden
god of his own on the
premises, which cheap,
toad-shaped divinity was
the sole companion of his
solitude, and, when not
ministering the comforts
of religion to the devout
Confucian, it anchored
out in the garden, osten-
sibly to hurry the vege-
tables up and keep its
eye on King’s interest.
This plaid deity per-
formed its honourable
and responsible duties
pretty well considering,
but sometimes the Chow
found slugs in his “cab-
bagee”and “leticee,”and
then he felt constrained
to bang his god over
the head with a hoe,
in consequence of which
display of resentment a
coolness would spring
up between them and
lead to a suspension
of friendly intercourse
for a day or two. During
this time Quong felt the
great scarcity of society
keenly, and yearned for a
woman’s influence about
his old, lop-sided, mud
hut —for a wife to dispel
his ennui by hearing
bottles and bricks and
things at his conoidal
sconce.

There was one lady in
Clunes upon whom the
fat heathen cast his
long, liquid optic with a
particularly gazelle-like stare of reverential adora-
tion, and towards whom he addressed himself in
tones more than ordinarily lusingando and eon
dolcezza (see musical handbook). Her name was
Bridgetta O’Gorman, or something, and he loved
her with a strange, sad passion, occasionally
swelling and intensifying its pressure to tumul'
tuous agitation; and the aggravation and wear
and tear on his highly-susceptible, Mongolian
temperament wore harder to bear than taxes; and
ret she was not an artistic building nor gloriously
fair to gloat upon, according to the
styles and the standards of beauty now in favour
amongst connoisseurs—she shot too far out of her
boots, and too much humanity was wasted in
building her feet. She grew to a height of seventy-
three inches, and was thatched with ripe red hair,
and had some blonde complexion in between the
multiform, large, Quaker-drab freckles ; her hands
had more than the allotted span, her features par
took of. the early Milesian style, and her garments
hung to her joints like a blanket on a hat-rack.
But she was genial in manner, and her smile went
a long way east and further west, and was a fine,
humorous cavity to contemplate from the other
side of a fence, and she dazzled Quong Ming with
it when he went hanging his head over the back
gate, crying “oabbagee” in melodious accents.
* * *
Bridgetta seemed to feel for the lone Chinaman,
and she lent a sympathetic ear to his dulcet dis-
course, and Quong smiled and smiled till his head
ached, and his mangled English became softer and
more winning, and he looked pensive and cherubic,
and wriggled and contorted so soulfully in his
anxiety to be nice that the strain threatened to
cripple his intellect; and she sent her ten-chain
smirk rippling over her face, and answered in his
own broken patter flavoured with a sweet accent
from Limerick ; after which she beat him down
50 per cent, in his charges, and Quong would
take up his burden and bear off to the right, cast-
ing back an oblique glance of unutterable de-
votion. Mrs. O’Gorman had a husband of her
own, and a bit of his front name was Mike.
He, too, towered to a great altitude, and had
strawberry - blonde hair, and advanced feet,
and a hand like a smoke-dried ham run over
by a steam-roller ; he earned a living hauling
trucks about down a mine, and could hit a blow
that scaled up near a ton, and deliver a kick that
would shift a twelve-stone man through a weather-
board bouse 30 x 14. Mr. Q. Hing had never
come across Michael in the way of business, and,
although hesurmised that there was a “boss ” about
somewhere, he had no idea of his terrible aspect and
his depth of chest, therefore the apparition of an
awful retribution did not hang with any great
weight about his celestial soul, and he continued
to besiege the heart of Bridgetta O’Gorman, and
decorate himself to be acceptable in her sight.
* # #
When Quong had been retailing vegetables on
credit to Mrs. O’Gorman for about two months at
prices a ruinous per centage below current rates, he
determined at last to state his case and spread
pagan affections at the large feet of the en-
chantress. So one soft, summer morning when cab-
bages were high he told the old, old story over
the back-gate, and besought the fair Bridgetta
to fly from the arms of the base-born O’Gorman,
and dwell with him on his irrigation farm by
Bircher’s Greek, where she might rest for ever in
sweet seclusion and run the small, squat, wooden
god in her own interest. The lady did not hop
round and display any hysterical excitement at
the delicate proposal of the dark, stout foreigner,
her pure, county Limerick blood remained normal,
and she heard him out with an affectation of
gentle commiseration and secured a further reduc-
tion of 10 per cent, on turnips that day. Quong
Hing renewed his prayers at later dates, but it
was a fortnight before his ardent solicitations
wore on the long, strong object of his youthful
affections sufficiently to win her consent to a
scheme of elopement concocted in tribulation, and
then she appeared to abandon all matronly
scruples, and bade him come along with a dray at
the time of night appointed, and remove her
and her belongings to his stronghold out back,
where she might] spend her days in a rural
seclusion and devotional calm, and enjoy the
domestic power and intense adoration to which
her mental gifts and charms of person partly
entitled her. At this Quong rejoiced with ex-
ceeding great joy; he had expressly stipulated for
Bridgetta’s belongings, because his rustic home
was not fitted with equivalents, and the prospect
of scooping a lot of valuable fixtures as well as a
wife was pleasant to his Mongolian soul.
* * *
Mike was on night shift at the mine that week,
and, at the time appointed, two hours beyond mid-
night, Quong drove up through the dense gloom in
a vehicle borrowed from a compatriot in the town
and drawn by a fading, melancholy horse with
spiral twists in his legs. Mrs. O’Gorman was in
readiness. The house was in darkness, and she
had her head bandaged in a shawl to avoid the
night dews. She assisted Quong to hoist two big
boxes and a few other fixtures into the dray, then
mounted behind and crouched down amongst the
goods, and the flitting continued, the solemn, bor-
rowed horse feeling his way carefully through the
prevailing fog out of the
town and over the com-
mon. Few and short
were the words they said,
and the elopement pro-
gressed favourably until
the mud humpy on
the bank of Bircher’s
Creek was reached ; there
it unloaded, and the
enraptured Chow left
his red-headed prize illu-
minating his humble
homestead, whilst he un-
shipped the quadruped
and tethered it to a tree.
* * *
Quong King was filled
with emotions of great
rapture as he turned again
towards his domicile—
his home was no longer
cold and lone, he would be
no longer forced to com-
mune solely with an irre-
sponsible, striped deity
hewn out of wood. His
joy found vent in a
barbaric ditty as he re-
entered the hut, but the
melody died on his
lips, and his pigtail
unhitched and stuck
out like the handle
of a maul, when he
saw that instead of the
fair Bridgettahis humble
home was occupied by
a strange, wild man of
about her stature and
complexion, and wearing
her old, familiar, brown
skirt over a pair of yellow
moles. Whilst King was
leaning up against the
bush-built furniture with
his head wide open and
his eyes standing out like
bubbles on a bottle, the
two big boxes opened
mysteriously, and out of
each stepped a large, stern
man with a malevolent
eye, both of whom silently
seated themselves on the
lids, and fixed the conster-
nated heathen with the
said ill-boding optic.
Quong realised the
delicacy of his unfortunate
position in about half-
a-minute, then he closed
up his face, and passed
out across country. He
was speedily overhauled
by Mr. O’Gorman, and
led back by the tail, and
was then subjected to a
rigid cross-examination
by the committee of three,
who, failing to elicit any-
thing further from the
yellow Lothario than an
earnest assurance that
he didn’t “savee,” pro-
ceeded to disrobe him
and warm up some tar,
which had also been in-
troduced under a disguise
into the elopement.
* # *
Despite his vociferous
protests and strenuous
exertions, the three
strong, stem persons
with whom he had
eloped began to paint
and decorate his exten-
sive surface with coal-tar,
and after exhausting
their artistic ingenuity in
strange curves and pat-
terns of wild device, wiped
them all out in one plain,
combination garment of
black, stretching all over
his wide waste of China-
man. They then unrolled
a package of feathers,
and relieved his funeral
hue with tufts and patches
of white plumage, and
finished thei r painting and
decorating by converting
Quong into a gigantic
species of water-fowl,
and sousing him in the
creek in Ins new water-
tight cuticle and nice
warm coat of feathers.
The three men subse-
quently returned to
Clunes in the vehicle belonging to his compatriot,
takin ff with them their boxes and possessions,
* * *
, ■ Q uon ff was never satisfied in his mind as to how
his sweet, sad romance had terminated so pam-
fully, but he refrained from calling on Bridgetta
for an explanation—his pride would not permit it.

BIT OF SCANDAL.
Our ladies’ man heard the following conversa-
tion between two young and good-looking ladies in
a suburban train yesterday : —First Lady: “ That’s
a sad affair about Mrs. eloping with her hus-
band’s coachman. What could have been the
reason?” Second Lady : “ Don’t you know? It’s
the talk of the town. Her hubby refused to
furnish her with a bottle of the famous St. Louis
Lager Beer, and the coachman offered to supply
her wants. A reason weighty, strong and
effectual.”


UEPSON'S FORTUNE
[FOR THE BULLETIN.)
BOOK L- THE CAUSE.
Death had tapped him on the shoulder,
and Huxley Jepson, reluctantly answering to the
call, had gone the way of all flesh. And so the
inhabitants of the house in East Melbourne found
him one showery October morning dead in a chair
that seemed more animate than he. Albany Jep-
son, only son of the dead man, felt his parent’s
decease with powerful distinctness. That fatal
stroke of the sharp sword of Death, the friend of
those he takes and the enemy of those who mourn
the departed, had at once severed the young man
from his last living relative and a comfortable
income. For, though old Jepson carried not his
riches with him on his last and longest journey,
his decease deprived the son of an allowance.
Huxley Jepson had started life with a unique
speciality in kidney-diseases, an inordinate love of
the horrible exceeding the love of woman, a mania
for collecting instruments of torture, and a fortune
of £lOO,OOO. This was in 1859, and Huxley was
then 21 years of age. He married a couple of
years later and shortly after achieved, or had
thrust upon him a son, the Albany J epson of this
history.
For over the next two decades the life of the
man, whose money should have made him a
factor in the prosperity of the country, consisted
in gathering together from all points of the com-
pass, racks, thumbscrews, scavenger’s-daughters,
immense boots which had been manufactured
(either in the dim remote or in modern Brumma-
gem) to contain foot-baths of boiling oil or lead,
gouges, hanging chains, and sundry other instru-
ments of torture. The death of his wife did
not check Huxley Jepson’s mania. Certainly he
deserted his interesting study for 51 minutes to
follow the funeral procession to the grave, but the
moment the mourning carriage had returned from
the cemetery and deposited him at his own door
he tore up the stairs to his room and became im-
mersed in an enthralling description of the tor-
tures forming the chief part of the ceremonies
prescribed by precedent and custom on the death
of a West African king.
His son grew up to manhood, but the father’s
affection for him had always been and remained a
purely mechanical feeling. Jepson, senior, was
wedded to his hobby. His cherished offspring
were various devilish inventions to be applied to
the rending of the human body, and he adopted
as children the “maidens” and so on whose per-
petual purchase and importation drained his one-
time princely fortune.
So, on the 15th October, 1884, all who knew
them saw Jepson the son, a good-looking spend-
thrift of 22 years, and J epson the father, a parch-
ment-faced monomaniac, with eyes as wild as
those of a mountain cat and with the weight of
his 46 years of hobbyism and kidney-disease bear-
ing heavily upon his shoulders and bowing him to
the grave. A heart-trouble had also made its ap-
pearance, but, despite the patent fact that the
Reaper walked as a shadow beside him, he ad-
hered to his unproductive labours. The grim
angel found him unfit to leave or die—gloating
over a maul that had originally been used in
America for breaking the joints of captives, and
not being very particular, wrote his name in a book,
gave a receipt for his soul and took him. So he
died and was buried.
Small return had he made for his good start in
life. To his debit was entered a fortune beyond
the imaginings of ordinary prosaic avarice, 25
years of existence that he could have made worthy,
a wife and a son—lent to him as a trustee in whom
their welfare and happiness were vested —and a
starved soul that was his own. On the credit side
of his account-page stood only a son, slightly soiled
—a house—in bad repair—£6oo in ready cash, a
collection of instruments of torture and a blacken-
ing corpse.
His father’s funeral over, Albany Jepson
mixed himself a glass of whisky-and-water and
tried to think out some plan that would ensure
him a decent subsistence. He had never learnt
either trade or profession, though his peculiar
organism eminently fitted him for the highest
branch of the former. Looking at him you read
his abilities at a glance. A man to provide work
for the patent-office, mercurial and inventive,
without the slightest reverence for anything that
called for honour by reason of its age or connection
with antiquity. Consequently he considered that
the living distiller of the whisky he was drinking
was far and away a better man than any of the
dead and mouldering heroes and sages who have
provided this degenerate world with its best litera-
ture and traditions of chivalry.
Thus on that October afternoon Albany Jepson
is sitting in the verandah of the dismal and osten-
tatious house whose pretensions he could not
afford to maintain —endeavouring with all the
strength of his hitherto untried but naturally
practical mind to carve out his future while the
corpse-like odour from his late father’s insectivor-
ous plants insinuated itself into his nostrils. True,
he was nob altogether without resources, £6OO in
money—the only valuable item—a mortgaged house
with which he could do nothing, and the collection
of instruments of torture purchased at fabulous
prices by the father, which were a very white
elephant and source of misery to the son. He did
not know what to do with them. His creditors hear-
ing of the death of the “ old man,” swooped down
like crows to the spoil which they fancied had an
existence. But they found that the fat body upon
which they expected to gorge was a mere skeleton.
Albany did all he could for them. He offered one
irate holder of a promissory-note bearing interest
at 98 per shent a thumbscrew with patent or
patentable gearing attachment, in total settlement
of his claim. To another he proposed to give a
scavenger’s-daughter on account. Anybody who
knows the bad manners invariably possessed by
creditors will at once conclude that these munifi-
cent offers were scornfully rejected. Albany re-
solved to make no further attempt at payment
and to keep his £6OO intact.
But one day a usurer more hard-featured and
barnacle-like than his fellows pressed the un-
fortunate Albany so hard that in desperation the
young man offered him the whole collection in
payment. To this the money-lender, who, by the
way, was not a Jew but a very respectable Calvinist,
replied “No, my friend, it’s not good enough,
because there’s no market for such things, nor will
there be until the Presbytery has managed to pass
a godly Sawbath-breaking-act with ap-p-r-r-r-o-
-pnate penalties.” And he departed, as the others
had done, not one penny the richer.
His words had, however, fallen on productive
ground. Albany knew that no local market
existed but why not in China, Africa and the
more barbarous of the Pacific Islands ? The
chance idea came like an inspiration. It was the
path that led from the labyrinth. The young
man’s fears for the future were set at rest. The
chance bullet had found its billet, and Albany at
once acted on the idea of the usurious elder.
* #r *
In February, 1885, a small convention of
I* anc led together and called themselves
The Torture - Instrument Universal Supply
Syndicate.” The syndicate, so the prospectus set
out, was formed “to secure by purchase or other
wise the rights of the scheme propounded by Mr.
Albany Jepson (hereinafter styled the vendor),
respecting the supply to barbarian rulers of the
ancient instruments of torture now in the pos-
session of the vendor as aforesaid.” The necessary
capital was subscribed in half-an-hour. Albany
received £5OOO in money, retained a one-fifth share
m the venture, and secured the position of tra-
velling manager at a salary of £lOOO per annum
and a liberal commission on all sales. The name
of travelling manager meant more than it actually
expressed. Albany Jepson, the former “young
blood ” of Melbourne, was sent out as bagman to
the company, to dispose of racks, boots and
boiling-oil-baths to savage potentates at the
greatest possible advantage.
Exactly four weeks after “ the establishment of
the syndicate,” a steamer with a low hull painted
in broad bands of black and yellow and flying a

carnation flag, dashed out of Port Phillip with
her prow heading for the West. On the bridge
stood Albany Jepson, travelling representative of
the ship’s owners; sailing with him were a crack
captain and an adventurous crew, and safely
stowed in the hold and ’tween decks was the mis-
cellaneous and heavy collection, lately the property
of the executor of the estate of the late Huxley
Jepson, Esq.
Book ll.— The Effect.
In the early part of 1888 the civilised world was
astonished with narratives published by West
African travellers regarding the discovery that in
the darkest portions of the dark continent
medifeval instruments of torture were in active
work among the subjects of certain tyrannical
native potentates. The English Society of Anti-
quarians arose as one member and propounded
theories and sent out explorers, who, as usual,
never travelled out of sight of the sea. A pro-
fessor of the Archaeological Society accounted for
the presence of the instruments by the theory that
a Spanish galleon had been wrecked on the
Western coast of Africa a few centuries ago, and
that the survivors, marrying with the native tribes,
were created chiefs, giving in return their know-
ledge of civilisation and the methods and
machinery of the Inquisition. And everybody
who thought of the matter at all, and indeed who
did not, decided that the professor was right and
stood afar off from him worshipping the abstruse
learning that had given to the world a feasible
solution to what the newspapers called “ The
African Problem. ” But the task of making pub-
lic the true origin of these strange and horrible
to the reporter of the foregoing and
following facts, who was sent out to Africa as cor-
respondent of an English newspaper with one
of the many exploring parties then starting.
The party travelled 20 miles further inland than
any of their predecessors ; then, becoming fright-
ened at the continuous reports of tribal hostili-
ties and fearing for their own safety, retreated
precipitately to the sea, leaving the African pro-
blem to the devil or anybody else who might be
interested in its solution. But the writer, deter-
mined to see the matter to its end if it really pos-
sessed such a thing, struck boldly towards the
interior with one friendly native—a polyglot in
his interpretation of dialects—as guide and com-
panion.
From this stage the writer can best tell his
story in the first person. My guide did not seem
able to account for the presence of so many ex-
ploring parties. I told him as well as I could of
the strange discoveries that had been made and of
the doubts and speculations which were exercising
the whole of the educated world at that moment.
When I came to the solution of the difficulty by
the Archaeological Society, which, to tell the
truth, I believed implicitly, he laughed to the
verge of apoplexy and said that the instruments
had been sold to the native rulers of the coast by
a white man who had come to the continent a year
previously in a striped steamer, and who was just
then doing traffic in the blood-curdling machinery
with the natives of the interior. His exact loca-
tion at that moment was Eboe City, New Calabar.
He had been honoured by the Eboe king and held
the office of Premier and Minister of Tortures to
no less than 50 tribal monarchs. The machines
that had been seen by the explorers in the pos-
session of the Coast tribes were as nothing when
compared to the torture-outfit of the kings of the
interior.
My curiosity was now fully aroused, and I de-
termined at all hazards to press onward to Eboe.
Five days of weary march across steep pinches
covered with a luxuriant and spiky growth of
cacti and aloes at length brought us to the last of
a series of small mountains, evidently the branches
of a large chain, when we saw the city of Eboe
Stretching before us. On first viewing the city we
saw one building which at that distance appeared
to be circular, of immense height, and built of
glittering-coloured stone. It seemed surrounded
with great trees. But an hour later when we
entered the place I saw that these trees were really
foliaged huts-the dwellings were built in the
branches. The place appeared deserted, but from
the great coloured stone building came a con-
fused buzz of voices. This, my guide informed
me, was the king’s palace. I then saw that it was
eight-sided and built in a kind of circle described
by the huts of the subjects. It was built
mainly of parget, a kind of gypsum stone, and the
glittering appearance I now remarked with delight
and astonishment was caused by blocks of mala-
chite let into every four courses of gypsum in the
same way that our builders ornament a structure
with red brick. The main edifice was the hall
of assembly and throne-room—the living apart-
ments of this African court projecting from the
sides of the octagon and seemingly hung in mid-
air.
We entered the palace by a stone gate that
revolved on unseen hinges, passed along a narrow
corridor that twisted and turned like a snake, and
suddenly found ourselves in an enormous hall
walled bound but open to the sky—a partial roofing
being provided by the foliage of huge tree-myrtles,
ninety feet high, throwing out their rich sprays of
blossom, parti-coloured as the plumage of a
macaw’s breast, for a distance of over fifty feet from
the parent stems. Within this vast octagon were
assembled fully 5000 dark-skinned men, with the
metallic lustre of black lead. At the head of the
octagon and in one of the courses of malachite was
set an immense and magnificent stone. Even in
that searching daylight its iridescence threw out
an illumination like a white sun. Immediately
under the electric jewel stood a beautifully-carved
throne covered with skins of beasts and grass mats
dyed with zanthine. On this throne was seated a
very dirty king, who looked very cruel and very
cowardly, and chewed incessantly some peculiar
nut that smelt like a
coffee-berry. All the
natives were almost naked
and were evidently wait-
ing for someone. Sud-
denly the buzz of voices
I had previously heard
again arose, necks were
craned forward —the buzz
grew to a shout and then
to a roar. The Africans
were cheering.
In the midst of their
plaudits there stepped
from a little wicket in
the wall a young man
in evening dress.
If, in my presence, a
Zulu had entered a Lon-
don theatre in a state of
nudity, I could not have
been more astonished
than I was to see that
young and good-looking
white man walk uncon-
cernedly into the centre
of that audience of
howling savages, and,
as he did so, fa s -
tidiously brush a speck of
dirt from his well-fitting dress-suit. The Eboeans
seemed to like the new arrival. The dirty king
even stopped chewing and expectorating, and
wrinkled his face so much in smiling a welcome
that the dirt cracked and peeled off his cheeks in
layers.
The new comer did not waste much time in pre-
liminaries. He called out something, and then a
door was thrown open and ten negroes appeared,
hauling after them a strange-looking machine.
When they had drawn the machine to the centre
of the octagon and' immediately opposite to the
king, the white man stopped them by a sign and
made a speech of which the following is a free
translation. (It will be observed that the speaker
told lies with the cheerfulness of the most hardened
empiric at a country fair.): —
“ May it please your Filthiness (at this compli-
ment the dirty king nodded with delight) I come
from a far-off land with an offering of submission-
price (or its equivalent in your currency) £lOOO
English money. As on my previous visits, I seek an
audience in the sacred name of TORTURE (here
the speaker was interrupted for some moments.
The phrase seemed to catch their fancy, and sundry
exclamations equivalent to “ hear hear ” broke
from the voices of the dusky crowd.) But to-day,
may it please your Filthiness, my mission far
transcends in importance my other calls on you.
The instrument I wish to introduce is unique in
respect to the suffering it causes. Such amuse-
ment may be derived from watching it in action
that no great king should be without one. The
Queen of England has one which she works her-
self. The Emperor of China had an inveterate
liver-disease which was slowly killing him, all
his medicine men could do nothing. He bought
one of these machines, experimented on several
hundreds of his subjects and the efficiency of the
invention as an amusing medium so pleased him
that to-day he is as well as ever. The name of
this wonderful source of instruction and enjoy-
ment is “ The Mechanical Commandment.”
Having had an opportunity of inspecting the
machine, the writer can describe it in more con-
densed form than if the inventor’s speech to the
king were reproduced here. The engine was borne
on six strong wheels. The body consisted of a
bifurcated cylinder with false walls turning on a
shaft, to which was attached a revolving drum,
the circular motion being obtained by the auto-
matic unwinding of two immense and equipotent
springs. The cylinder was large enough to admit
the body of a man, and was indeed constructed
for that purpose. The real walls of the cylinder
consisted of thin circular slides, ten in number.
The convex surface of each of these was a move-
able and reiterated stereotype of one of the ten
commandments.
The white man having explained his invention
the king called out for a trial and the inventor de-
manded a subject. The audience did not seem in-
clined to bear tortures whose exact quality and
duration they did not know, and in order to pro-
tect himself each man attempted to nominate his
fellow for the honour. At last an old man was
forcibly nominated and unanimously elected. A
big negro caught him by the waist and threw him
bodily into the centre of the octagon where he
was seized by the ten men who brought in the
machine, and who acted as its attendants. H«
was immediately divested of his loin-cloth and
ornaments. A slide, bearing an oft-repeated
stereo, of the Bth commandment was placed in the
cylinder, the subject was thrown into the slide
and the door was closed. A herculean attendant
strained at the handle of the winding apparatus
and another tugged a lever. The white man
stepped forward and pulled out a small peg that
was sunk in the face of the revolving drum.
Then the cylinder turned rapidly with the drum,
the false walls fell back, and a horrible sight met
my gaze. By some devilish mechanism, while the
cylinder revolved, the moveable types, razor-sharp
and hollow-edged, were in turn advanced from
their bed in the face of the slide and pressed into
the fleshy parts of the subject. The only sounds
we heard were the cries of the victim, the groan-
ing of the cylinder on its unoiled bearings, and
the horrible tap of those hollow-edged and rapa-
cious types as they entered, woodpeokerlike, the
flayed flesh of that poor quivering body. The
falling of the false walls allowed a sight of the
interior of the cylinder immediately the winding-
drum had completed three revolutions.
Even that stolid audience shuddered at the
horrible sight. I thought I should faint from very
sickness of the scene of blood—the white man
looked around triumphantly —the dirty king
grinned and smacked his thick lips.
Eor nearly a quarter of an hour the types pecked
at the subject, then with a crash the false walls of
the cylinder rose and came together, shutting out
the nauseous spectacle from my eyes. An auto-
matic gearing elevated the cylinder until it was
nearly vertical, a door opened at the lower end,
and a quivering mass of blood and bones and
flesh shot out and fell to the transparent floor
which reflected the gory object and so seemingly
multiplied the tragedy. At the same time the
drum revolved with frightful rapidity and the
spring ran down. Then my curiosity mastered
my nausea, f
I pressed towards the machine and saw that the
man had been flayed alive. On the raw flesh,
destitute of its natural black skin, appeared the
oft-rcpsated order, “ Thou shalt not steal,” printed
in the Eboe character. The elected had got mixed
up with the commandments.
And yet the inventor stultified the lesson of his
invention ; for the machine had stolen the life of
the subject -whose corpse bore the imprint of the
sacred law of Property.
I drew back, sickened and disgusted, and almost
trod on the toes of the king, who was examining
the sharp edges of the types and picking there-
from, witli great satisfaction, fragments of flesh.
At the same time a hand took mine, a good-
humoured mouth smiled on a level with my eyes,
and the voice of the inventor cried : “ Another
white man here ? Shake hands, old boy. I’m
glad to see you.”
Conversation was impossible in that crowded
hall, and we only exchanged names—at least I
gave him mine, and he handed me a delicately-
tinted card on which was engraved, “ Albany Jep
son, Melbourne, Australia.”
The king made up to where we were standing,
and without any haggling accepted England’s
offer of submission at the price of £lOOO. I was
introduced to His Filthiness by Jepson as a brother
of his, and from the moment the inventor’s friend-
ship for me became known I was as safe in that
savage African city as if I had been a convict in
gaol.
# # *
During the next few days my new acquain-
tance was so busy selling his machine to small
rulers under the authority of the Eboean king
that nearly a week elapsed before I had a chance
of speaking to him. We became so friendly,
although I still viewed his horrible business with
disgust, that a fortnight after my arrival in Eboe
city he told me the story of his life, with the early
part of which the reader is already familiar.
Regarding his doings since his departure from
Melbourne he said that it had been one long round
of traffic, relieved by an occasional brush with
natives who refused to listen to Reason —that
being one of the aliases under which Albany
Jepson worked. The Pacific Islands, China,
Japan, Russia, South America and Africa had
all been visited in turn, and such a great tr.ade
had arisen that the original collection had long
since given out. To cope with the extraordinary
demand a manufactory had been established on
board the syndicate’s ship, but even the eighty
workmen engaged could not supply the instru-
ments fast enough. My companion had invented
several other engines besides the “ Mechanical
Commandments,” and these had been scattered
broadcast over the country at fabulous prices.
The native rulers paid in their own currency—
gold-dust, ostrich feathers and ivory—and were
more often than not cheated outside of the fabulous
prices charged by the company. The King of
Eboe had bartered for the last machine sold him a
quantity of malachite from the royal quarries and
diamonds of splendid quality, worth in a civilised
market considerably over eight thousand pounds.
“I drew hark, sicken'd and disgusted
Jepson said his banking account was now nearly
£750,000, the syndicate had become a large com-
pany, and the market value of their shares was
represented by seven figures. I spoke of the
cruelty of the traffic. He laughed and asked me
“ What else a nigger was good for At the same

time he promised to give up his position as soon
as his capital totalled one million.
We drifted into other subjects, and I asked
when I could expect to get a ship homewa-rd
bound. To my delight he said that the Jaguin,
the company’s steamer, would be off the coast in
about a week from that date and would take me to
Hamburg, where he intended to establish a great
factory. Next day (Sunday) we set out, accom-
panied by a guard of honour, who did not leave us
until long after the malachite palace of Eboe had
disappeared in the surrounding hills. About ten
o’clock on the following Saturday night we, with
our attendant band of negroes, approached the
part of the coast where Jepson expected to find
the steamer. On nearing the beach I saw two
columns of lurid light blazing, as it appeared to
me, on the bosom of the sea. I could hardly res-
train my impatience for discovery of its source,
but was compelled to follow my companion who
walked along the beach until he came to a scooped -
out drive or embrasure in the face of the sandy
cliffs. From this pointed a small cannon. Jepson
pulled out the plug, lit a gun-match, and applied
it to the touch-hole. A volume of flame spurted
out and a deafening report followed. A few
minutes elapsed and then the boom of a gun,
whose flash seemed to issue from the heart of the
light I had before noticed was borne to our ears
in answer, Half-an-hour later a small steam-
launch ran into the cove where we were stand-
ing. Jepson motioned me on board the launch,
took a seat by my side, the little vessel was
swung out to sea, and we were running at full
speed in the direction of the mysterious flame.
We neared it, and then I saw that the fire was not
supernatural. It issued from chimnies built on
the deck of a steamer whose hull was painted
black and yellow, and from whose forepeak a car-
nation flag, bearing the letter “J.” in yellow,
flapped idly in the light breeze. I mounted the
accommodation ladder and stood on the deck
of that nautical mystery, “ The Jaguin.” On
its upper and ’tween decks a foundry and engineer-
ing shop was in full swing. The flames I had
seen came from the stacks of the iron-smelters.
That night preparations for clearance were
made. The deck foundry fires were gradually
cooled, and next morning the Jaguin left for
Hamburg. On July 15, I landed in that German
city.
I took passage in a packet for Southampton,
but before leaving gave my word of honour to
Albany Jepson to stay my hand for a year
in publishing this strange history. We promised
to correspond with each other, and regularly did
so. I have two of his letters before me now. The
first I received prior to my departure from London
in February of this year. The letter told me that
the Company was extending its operations and
that the foundation of a large factory had been
laid in Hamburg. The buildings were so exten-
sive that nine months would be occupied in their
erection. I arrived in Melbourne early in April
and at once started work on the city press. In
June last I received letter No. 2. It told me that
trade was increasing more than ever, that the
writer’s fortune was over a million, and that he
intended to stand by his frightful traffic.
Albany Jepson promised to leave that company
and he has broken his word to me. My promise
of non-publication expired in July last, and I now
lay the whole truth of the matter before a world
that has hitherto accepted as truth concerning the
African soiarce of implements of torture, the theory
of a learned professor of Archaeology.
I wish to show that there are, or shortly will be,
in the world two factories employing human labour
to produce engines for the procuration of human
suffering. The address of the one is the “ ocean,”
the location of the other will be Hamburg, Ger-
many. In another month these last works will
commence manufacture, and cruelty and greed
will be augmented and reign supreme. And
knowing this I call on the Christian nations of the
world to suppress and close the factories and
punish the factors. Christianity, humanity,
call for it, and if the cry is answered by one
country only, this work will not be fruitless or
this history die.

Our Christmas Day.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
We entered on our Christmas sports with hearts
assured of fun.
For there were games and trophies on the list for
ev’ry one;
Whoever could run fastest would obtain a silver
jug;
Whoever could jump highest would bear off a
golden mug;
The man who danced the smartest jig would get a
diamond pin,
And he who sang the drollest song a silver watoh
would win;
The man who wrestled best would take an ink*
stand as a prize,
And he who spoke the neatest speech, a box of
satin ties;
He who would write the crispest verse impromptu
would acquire
A soup-tureen embellished with the figure of a
lyre ;
In fact, on nearly ev’ry kind of feat a prize was
set,
And so each one believed that he some handsome
thing would get;
But last, unto the judge was giv’n the power to
devise
Some simple task to further test each winner of a
prize ;
The task, it was resolved, should be a reasonable
one,.
And such as most men would consider easy to be
done ;
And he who failed to meet this test would be ad-
judged to pay
The prize he won back to the sports for the next
Christmas Day.
The sun was bright, the air was fresh, the Christ-
mas sports began,
& dozen men at the word “ Off !” across the open
ran.
Ned Thompson, long and slender, threw his feet
out merrily,
And Neale O’Rorke, of nugget build, was brisk
and fleet as he ;
Job Ambrose panted onward making footprints in
the van,
And healthy rivalry lit up the face of ev’ry man ;
But he who caused the laughter of the lookers-on
to rise
Was Alderman MTavish pegging onward for the
prize.
His measure round the waist the same was as
from head to toe,
His legs were short and bandy, but the way he
made them go
Excited mirth among the crowd till leaning back
they yelled
That ne’er before had Christmas Day a race so
droll beheld.
But when the heat was over and the dust had
cleared away
M‘Lavish was declared to be the winner of the
day.
They measured with a yardstick three-feet-six upon
a stump,
And drew a line across the path to make a stand-
ing jump;
And full a dozen men again competed for this
prize,
They were of various ages and as various in size;
And Alderman MTavish stood among this group
and when
The crowd beheld his dumpy form among the
jumping men
They laughed again and bet their hats and boots
and other things

A SHEARING STRUGGLE : LONG DAN VERSUS THE RAM.
That if he tried to jump they’d have to tie his
clothes with strings.
But he no word responded, but with sad and
solemn look
Watched one by one his rivals as a sudden spring
each took.
Some jumped and struck the tapeline with a heel
or with a toe,
Some tried to jump, but could not get their heavy
feet to go,
While others lifted up the line and pulled it from
its place,
And one great mammoth athlete tripped and fell
upon his face.
But Alderman MTavish sprang and worked hiss
passage o’er
The tapeline without touching it, and victor was;
once more.
And while they laughed he greedily caught up the
golden mug
And laid it at his feet beside the silver water-jug.
The ring was formed. M'Menamy, O’Dowd, and
Joyce and Dawes
Went rat-tat-tat upon the board in turn amid
applause;
And Oalverley and Lanigan excited loud acclaim.
Bub they were worsted by a man, O’Doherty by
name;
And all were thinking that the pin would to this
dancer go
When Alderman MTavish took the centre on his
toe.
Then toe and heel he jigged and jigged with sad
■ and solemn face,
Until, perforce, all called him the best dancer in
the place.
And so the diamond pin passed over to him as his
prize,
While laughter forced the sparkling tears to ev’ry -
body’s eyes.
But ere time was to talk of it a jolly song arose
About a man whose face looked white so crimson
was his nose;
And when this ceased another song about a wife
was sung,
Who made her husband speechless by the wagging
of her tongue.
And other songs still funnier were sung, until at
last
Bob Hutchinson set up a wail about a man who
passed
Himself off as a gentleman in foreign lands, while
he
Was but a legislator in a southern colony.
And ev’ryone so liked the song and laughed so
heartily
That Bob believed the silver watch his property
would be.
But at that very minute, with a melancholy face,
MTavish stepped out to the front and took the
singer’s place.
He put a thumb in each armhole of his white
waistcoat, and
He agitated feelingly the fingers of each hand,
And then he drew his lips apart and softly sang a
lay
About a bashful constable who threw his luck
away—
The cook was willing to approve his passion if
he’d speak,
Tor she could see love burning in the roses on his
cheek,
But he, that bashful constable, would never face
the task,
And she, exacting woman, would not yield unless
he’d ask;
And so the weeks and months passed by until one
night he found
The back-gate locked and learned that cook was to
another bound;
And filled with grief he left the Force and hired
his feet to be
Quartz-crushers on a reefing field without ma-
chinery
MTavish told the tale so well and sang it with
such zest
That one and all declared the song to be the
j oiliest.
And thus the judge decided, and the Alderman
once more
Received the prize and laid it with the prizes won
before.
The wrestlers now got ready and were paired off
two by two,
And no one wondered greatly when MTavish
came in view.
The crowd had ceased to laugh now, for he seemed
to know a way
Of coming first at ev’rything, both serious and
gay,
But still they thought that wrestling would bo
sure to pull him down,
For on the list were candidates of credit and re-
nown.
Luke Doyle was called the champion among
athletes, and was known
A dozen strong-limbed wrestlers in succession to
have thrown;
And Henry Smith, though smaller, knew the
tactics of the game,
And had for scientific form an undisputed fame ;
And others were so burly and so tough in thew
and skin,
The chances of M‘Tavish looked particularly thin.
The first pair took the ring, and there were shouts
for him who won ;
The next pair wrestled manfully, and then the,
next came on;
And so the series worked along till those who went
below
Were cleared away, and those who won went fora
second go;
And these again, and still again worked down
until but two,
Each victor right along his line, remained to fight
it through.
Luke Doyle was one of
these who all along
had kept his feet,
And Alderman M‘Tavish
was the other bold
athlete.
There rose a loud huzzj
when these two
braves stood face to
face,
And ev’rybody crowded
in to get the nearest
place.
M'Tavish wore the same
sad look and let
Doyle push the fray,
And for a while it seemed
as if he’d surely lose
the day.
But all at once, to Doyle’s
amaze and ev’ryone’s
surprise,
M'Tavish threw him on
his back and claimed
the inkstand prize.
At this stage one got up
and said the Aider-
man should be
D i squalified for the events
to come, but sym-
pathy
Was now on top, and
merrily the judge
declared he’d stand
To ev’ry rule laid down—
and this was cheered
on ev’ry hand.
But yet it simmered in
the minds of all that
no man could
Win ev’ry time, and so
they thought the
speech or verses
would
Dethrone him ; but again
amaze dilated mouths
and eyes
When he was adjudged
winner of the box of
satin ties;
And consternation fell on
them when in his
hands they saw
The soup-tureen for verses
made impromptu
without flaw.
And now they all sat
down upon the green
and let him take
The balance of the prizes
without troubling for
their sake;
And AldermanJVDTavish,
without word and
without smile,
Put prize with prize until
he owned the Christ-
mas party’s pile;
And then he, too, sat
down and asked a
glass of whisky
“ neat,”
And having quaffed it
said he thought the
sports were now
complete.
“Ah, stay,” the Judge cried; “Alderman, you
know I can propose
A final test, and if you fail, why, back that
booty goes.
I hardly know what thing to choose, for you are
so complete
A master of accomplishments in body, mind, and
feet.
Now let me think. Iwant those prizes back, X
plainly say ; '
And yet the task must simple be. I wish I had
a day
To turn it over. Let me think. . . I have it!
Alderman
M‘Tavish, I admit that you the whole day led
the van,
But now I say, ‘Go bathe yourself, or giv<e
THOSE PRIZES BACK ! ’ ”
The order, like a lightning-flash, first struck
M‘Tavish black,
And then, as if a thunderbolt, it crashed him to
the ground ;
And in a swoon an hour he lay, and on his
coming round
Cried : “ Take the prizes—tajke them back ! O
judge unfair, unjust!
You ask what is impossible—base traitor to your
trust ! ”
And so when next the Christmas sports come
round each one will have
Another chance to win a prize by exploit gay or
grave.

The Ring of Invisibility.
(BY. V.J.DALEY.
Part I.
It was a soft, warm night in the month of
December. The stars shone down with benignant
lustre—not the freezing cynical brightness of their
wintry gleam on homelessness and hunger—-from a
sky of deepest blue. The most thoughtless and
unsensitive of men feels on such a night (unless,
indeed, he have the toothache or the gout) that it
is not altogether a misfortune to be alive. The
spell of the dying day is upon him. He is con-
scious in some way, however dimly, of that feel-
ing, half-sad, half-sweet—sweet that such loveliness
should be, sad that like all things lovely it should
pass away so soon—-that poets have sung of in
their songs of the evening since the beginning of
time. He is pensively happy even to know that
he is living, and if he be a smoker and have
tobacco, he begins to feel that if things could only
continue so he would not much care if he lived for
ever.
* * #
The lamps were lit in the city, making
little islets of light in the soft and pleasant dark.
One might liken them, as they stretched away in
serried rows till the last was but a faint speck, to
those luminous minds that have handed down the
light of knowledge to us from age to age, or other-
wise be satisfied to say with Dr. Moloney, of Mel-
bourne (a very pretty poet when he likes, though
he is a doctor)—
I saw the parallels of thy long streets
With lamps like angels shining all arow.
(N.B, —The foregoing is all in the way of poetry
that will appear in this sketch.)
* * *
Everybody, young and old, seemed to be
out of doors, and everybody looked happy. Even
the stolid policeman on his beat, to whom an
evening stroll could be no enthralling novelty,
walked along with an air of placid enjoyment.
The shops were brilliantly lighted, and had all
their most attractive wares arranged in more or
less artistic designs in their windows. But most
of the glory was carried off by the grocers and the
toy-sellers. Such mountains of loaf-sugar, such
rivers of raisins, rimmed by lemon-peel and running
through pleasant plains of lollipops, such rows of
Christmas candles of every colour of the rainbow
were surely never seen before. But the toy-shops
ah, they were a sight to see! There were the
flags of all nations; but chiefly the “bonny blue
flag of Australia ” waving in the hands of dolls of
every size and shape and station in life—from the
plebeian wooden doll with no clothes on and two
dots for eyes, and a mouth made of a straight line,
and ramshackle legs and arms morticed to the body in
acheap-anyhow-Chinese-furniture way that showed
her future home was Collingwood Elat, to the
blonde, fluffy-haired, blue-eyed professional-beauty
doll with the hectic cheeks and the gobelin silk dress
made in the latest fashion, who looked at you in a
way that said as plainly as possible: “My destina-
tion is Toorak—you will please not speak to me
without an introduction.” And the crackers, and
the prancing horses that seemed to have been fed
on corn all their lives, so spirited were they, and
the trains and trams that looked as if they would
enjoy nothing better than to get out into the street
and run over somebody. They were wonderful.
And then there was, large as life, Eather Christ-
mas, with his long, grey beard, and the snow
sparkling on his ulster and the holly-bush on his
shoulders. Surely the owner of those toy-shops
must have been Santa Claus, who had called him-
self by a lot of other names in order to deceive
people who didn’t know any better. But that old
man is not our Eather Christmas. Our Daddy
Christmas is a very different sort of personage.
He is a bluff, hearty fellow with a big, brown
beard, dressed in a suit of boating-flannels, and
wearing a broad-brimmed straw hat. On one arm
he carries a bunch of Christmas-bush, and on the
other a basket of Australian hock and a small ice-
berg wrapped in flannel. Or he might be other-
wise represented attired in pyjamas and killing
mosquitoes with a towel. Or even sitting nude
in a bath-tub, sucking iced water through a straw.
Any way, in fact, but with the long, grey beard
and the ulster and the snow and the holly-bush. I
trust the toy-sellers will bear this in mind next
Christmas.
# # #
Beautiful, however, as the night was, and
gay as were the shops, there was one who took
no interest in them. In a small upper room* in a
dingy house, situated in a dingy back street in
Eitzroy, sat a pale, gaunt-cheeked young man,
staring moodily at a solitary candle spluttering
feebly in a gin-bottle. Let us first look at the
room. There is in one corner a truckle bed, on
which are piled, in picturesque confusion, a broken
plate, a cup and saucer, a tumbler with a piece out
of the lip, a few books in different stages of ruin,
an old hat and coat, a frayed collar and threadbare
speckled tie. Not much to boast of in that lot.
In the middle of the room one chair, upon which
the tenant is sitting, and a wooden table with two
legs in the grave and the other two tottering on
the verge. On the table the aforesaid candle in
the gin-bottle, some paper, a pen, ink (in egg-cup),
a wooden pipe, a plug of tobacco, and a bottle half
filled with a gax’net-coloured fluid, which smells
exceedingly like rum. In fact, it is rum. That is
the whole inventory. There is nothing more,
unless you would include a hole in the floor, which
leads to a nest inhabited by a poor and struggling
family of rats. “ Humph,” soliloquised the young
man, in a tone of gloomy jocularity, glaring at the
rat-hole, “if they don’t eat me soon I’ll have to
eat them. It will be a noble Christmas dinner for
a man of letters. Bah !” with which remark he
flung one of his boots savagely in the direction of
the rat-hole, and took a long swig at the rum-flask.
This seemed to brighten him up, and, pulling
the bundle of paper over to him, he took up his pen
and commenced to write something. A poem,
article, story ? No —a schedule of his debts. This
is what he wrote :
Rent of room, three weeks, at 7a. 6d. per week £l2 6
Baker, three weeks’bread, 3d. per day .. 5 3
Bootmaker, half soleing and heeling boots .. 4 0
Money borrowed from M‘Ginnis of Press Bureau 12 6
Washerwoman M „ 2 0
£2 6 8
# # #
He looked at this document with a rueful
grin, and murmured, “If they would only take
threepence on account I might manage to square
up in time, but ” Here he plunged into a
reverie in which he imagined that Mr. James
Tyson, who is said to possess a little property in
Queensland, had made him his heir. The first
thing he did with his newly-acquired wealth was
to found a Home for Distressed Literary Men,
with a distillery attached. In the midst of this
and other philanthropic projects he was suddenly
startled by the sound of footsteps on the stairs.
“The landlady!” he muttered, and his heart
stood still. It was not that awful female. The
sounds came no nearer, and his heart beat regu-
larly once more. But his golden visions were
dispelled for that evening. In a few minutes the
footsteps returned, and a knock came to the door.
This time it was the landlady in stern reality.
“ A letter for you,” she said, handing it to him ;
“it has been here since six o’clock; I didn’t know
you were in. I hope there is good news this
time. ” The last remark was accompanied with a
grim smile. The landlady withdrew, and he read
the address on the envelope with a dismal smile.
This is how it ran ;
Reginald Rumpunch, Esq.,
Journalist,
Care of Mrs. M'Gwiggan,
Murphy-street, Fitzroy,
“Learning is never wasted,” he said, holding
the envelope unopened to the flame of the candle
till it was consumed. “If I had not been a student
of French literature I should never have hit upon
the dodge, and I should never have been allowed
to stay here three weeks without paying rent.”
He was thinking of an anecdote recorded of a
young French genius who was in a similar posi-
tion in Paris, and who kept in his landlady’s good
graces for a time by posting letters to himself
addressed—
M. Eugene Rapin,
Homme de Lettres.
This made her think him a man of much corres-
pondence, who would be able, without doubt, to
settle her account before long. This game, how-
ever, clever as it was, could not be played for
ever. Therefore Mr. Rumpunch—by the way,
that was not his name, but as he now holds a
decent, not to say sanctified, position in society,
it will have to pass instead of his real one—was
seriously exercised in mind as to what dodge he
should next try to keep himself alive with a roof
over his head. But it was not in the nature of
Mr. Rumpunch to think seriously about anything
for more than two or three minutes at a time, so
he lit his pipe, got up from the table, and opening
the window looked out at the stars. He might
have been thus engaged for five or ten minutes
when he heard a cough behind him. It was a small
deprecatory cough, yet it startled him. Turning
round, he saw a figure sitting in the chair he had
just risen from. It was the figure of a small-sized
man, apparently 50 to 60 years of age, with red hair,
a limp, black moustache that was palpably dyed,
weak, watery eyes, and a feeble mouth. This odd-
looking creature was clad in a shabby, black suit
that might once have been fashionable and even
elegant, and two overcoats, yet withal, and though
the night was warm, he seemed to be shivering
with cold. All the signs of linen about him were
a paper collar and a celluloid cuff which he was
continually pulling down over his wrist. His feet
were partially encased in patent-leather boots,
which, though he tried to conceal the fact by keep-
ing them under the table, Mr. Rumpunch saw at a
glance were patched in various places, and very
much down at the heel. He looked like the wreck
of an ancient beau who had once ruffled it with the
best, but who, for years, had been trudging
through the gutters of Misfortune.
“Who the devil are you ?” said Mr. Rumpunch,
after he had got over his first astonishment.
“You have guessed it —clever lad!” said the
shabby old gentleman, with a feeble chuckle,
which ended suddenly in a fit of asthmatic cough-
ing.
Part 11.
“For the sake of Heaven—l mean in the
Devil’s name—close that window, I’m freezing,”
cried the little, old gentleman.
“ Well, I’m d -d !” remarked Mr. Rumpunch,
mostly to himself and the atmosphere, staring in
extreme astonishment at his curious visitor.
“Not yet—not yet, my lad; all in good time,
but do shut that window.”
Now, Mr. Rumpunch was a somewhat choleric
young man, and very apt to fire up at anything he
chose to consider arrogance, if applied to him per-
sonally, but for all that, he had a strong sense of
humour, and the little old gentleman struck him
as a character worth studying. Besides, though
there was a general look of dilapidation and help-
lessness about his visitor he had still an air of
high breeding and better times which involun-
tarily commanded respect.
Mr. Rumpunch closed the window.
“ I trust you will excuse me, sir, for intruding
upon you in this unceremonious manner,” said the
little old gentleman relapsing suddenly into a tone
of nervous apology, “ but the fact is 1 have some-
thing important to say to you. May I—the
smallest drop ? ” and his hand hovered tremblingly
over the rum-bottle.
Mr. Rumpunch nodded an affirmative, and the
little old gentleman poured himself out a stiff
nobbier.
“ 11 m,” he muttered, putting the empty glass
down, “ pretty fair, but not enough fire in it. Ah,
my lad,” he continued, in a burst of enthusiasm,
“ you should have heard the chimes at midnight
with me and Faust.” Here he pulled up suddenly
as though he had said too much, and then went
on. “ But you know nothing of drinking. Rum
is no liquor for an immortal soul to get drunk on.
Your Dr. Johnson - who, by the way, is staying at
my place now—used to say brandy was the drink
for heroes, but I tell you,” and here the old gentle-
man’s eyes, weak and watery as they were, fairly
blazed, “there is no drink to be compared to a
naptha cocktail hot, with a bit of burning marl in
it. Many a one I’ve had with Judas. It was his
favourite tipple. Poor old Judas —he was my
only friend ! ” Here the old gentleman burst into
tears and poured himself out another nobbier.
* # •
This seemed to give him courage and he
proceeded with his discourse. Mr. Rumpunch
had thrown himself on the bed and was listening
with an amused smile, Hi 4 thoughts might be
summed up thus—This poor old scarecrow is evi-
dently mad but he is good fun. I will wait to see
how he developes —but he is very heavy on the
rum. Shouldn’t be surprised if he told me in a
minute or two he was the Devil.
The old gentleman coughed huskily and gasped,
“Young man, be thankful for your health. I
hope you’ll never know what it is to live on half a
lung as I have been doing for longer than I would
like to say. I daresay you will be surprised to
hear who I am,” he paused for a moment, and
then his voice sank to an awful asthmatic whisper
—“ Young man, I’m the Devil.”
“ I thought so,” murmured Mr. Rumpunch.
“ He will next tell me that he is the Bishop of
Melbourne in disguise.”
The little, old gentleman waited to see the effect
his revelation would make.on Mr. Rumpunch, but
as that young man did not seem to be in any
way terrified or even astonished, he (the little old
gentleman) sighed sorrowfully and said, “Yes, I
know I’m not what I was. Nobody seems to be
afraid of me now. I wish I were dead.”
“Take another drink,” said Mr. Rumpunch.
The little old gentleman did and grew more
cheerful.
From cheerful he passed to being confidential.
“ I’ll tell you what it is,” he said, “ as you don’t
seem to believe my word, I’ll give you a proof that
lam the devil, and no mistake about it. Have
you got a copper about you ?”
Mr. Rumpunch produced a penny and pitched it
over.
“Now, watch me carefully,” said the little old
gentleman, with the air of a Jensen or a Perron.
* * *
“You see I put it in my mouth—thus, and I
bring it out through my nose —so,” said the little
old gentleman, going through the usual manipula-
tion of those who perform this interesting trick.
But it didn’t come out of his nose. It stuck in
his sleeve, from which it fell ignominiously to the
floor the moment after.
Mr. Rumpunch grew very red in the face, but
made no sound. The little old gentleman was
greatly disconcerted; but as his failure did not
seem to be noticed, he said, “ There must be some-
thing wrong about that penny. Let me look at
the date.”
“ Ah,” he remarked, as he handed it back again,
“ I thought so. That was a bad year for me. It
was the year in which the Salvation Army was
started. But I can show you something better.”
One after another he tried the matchbox trick,
the three-card trick, the pea-and-thimble trick,
and failed miserably in all of them. He even tried
to light a match on his thigh, and couldn’t. “ I’m
not what I was,” he moaned, passing his hand
across his forehead, and gazing piteously at Mr.
Rumpunch. That young gentleman could restrain
himself no longer. He threw his arms abroad and
gave vent to shout after shout till the window
rattled in its sashes and the bed quivered under
him.
“Why,” he said, “you wretched old impostor.
You the Devil! If you were to come to a Queens-
land shearer after a spree and tell him that, he’d
kick you while he could lift a leg. I’ve seen better
devils than you in a pantomime. I’ve seen devils
that could eat you after I’ve come home from a
Temperance picnic. You’re not fit to be even a
ginger-beer devil. Why don’t you go to the
Benevolent Asylum ? Why don’t you die ? Why
don’t you sober up, anyhow ? ”
By this time Mr. Rumpunch noticed that the
little old gentleman was leaning with his head
upon his arms and weeping bitterly. Now, Mr.
Rumpunch was not illnatured, and when he saw
this he was sorry for what he had said and im-
mediately tried to make amends. “ Never mind,
old fellow,” he exclaimed, “ if you’re not the devil
I don’t suppose you’ve lost much. You finish off
that rum while I go for threepenn’orth of beer.”
Saying which he drew a jug from under the bed
and clapped the old gentleman cheerily on the
shoulder.
“ Stay, sir,” said the latter with dignity, “ you
hurt my feelings, but I don’t think you intended
to. nor do I blame you. I could hardly expect
you to recognise in the wretched creature who now
addresses you, that Being whose name has struck
terror into the hearts of men for thousands of
years—that mighty Satan of Milton ‘whose throne’
—I forget the passage, but you remember the rest.
Even my memory’s going. I don’t suppose,” (and
here he smiled with a pitiful attempt at jocularity),
“I would cause much consternation in a nursery
now. But I have still some power left as you
shall see. You mark this ring.”
Here the old gentleman drew a ring from the
third finger of his right hand and passed it to Mr.
Rumpunch.
“I do,” replied the latter, after examining it,
“it is brass, with a pebble in it.”
“ Call it what you please,” said the old gentle-
man ; “it is the ring I gave Solomon. Place it on
your finger with the stone upwards.”
Mr. Rumpunch did so.
“Now turn the stone downwards.”
Mr. Rumpunch obeyed.
“ Well!” he enquired.
“ Well,” said the little old gentleman, “ you are
now invisible. Try if you can see your reflection
in a looking-glass. ”
But the latter was an article of luxury Mr.
Rumpunch did not possess.
“ Go then,” said the little old gentleman, “for
the beer like a dear bad lad, and you can try the
effect of the ring at the hotel mirror. But mind
you go into the bar wearing the stone upwards. ”
Mr. Rumpunch departed, curious, but not
placing much faith in the powers of the wonderful
ring.
# * *
Yes, incredible as the statement may ap
pear in these unbelieving days, everything fell out
just as the little, old gentleman said it would.
Mr. Rumpunch placed the jug on the counter
and gave his order, then stepping into the back
parlour, in which there was nobody present, he
stood before the mirror and tried the power of the
ring.
The result was astounding—almost horrifying.
As he turned the stone slowly round he saw first
one arm, then a strip of a leg, and an ear disap-
pear, till, when the ring had made a quarter
revolution, he saw in the mirror the reflection of
half a man, as though he had been accurately split
down the middle. It was a grisly spectacle, you
may believe, and Mr. Rumpunch was never so
frightened at his own appearance before. Then, as
the stone approached the end of the semicircle, he
saw himself gradually fade out. First his remain-
ing eye went, then his leg, till at last there was
only Ins elbow left, which he was holding slightly
akimbo. Then this also disappeared and the
mirror was vacant. Mr. Rumpunch felt a shudder
pass through him. What if the diabolical old man
had taken away his visibility and he would have
to pass through the world for the rest of his life a
veritable vox et proeterea nihil ? The case of Peter
Schlemil would be a cheerful joke compared to his
if that were so. What woman would marry a
mere voice ? Who would give it credit or ask it to
dinner or make boots or pantaloons for it? The
thought was dreadful. Mr. Rumpunch turned
the stone rapidly round again, and behold, to his
great joy, there was the reflection of his complete
and proper self in the mirror once more ! “ That
old man must be the Devil, after all,” he mused,
as he returned with the jug, “ and I’ve talked to
him as I did !”
# *
“ And now, sir, are you satisfied,” en-
quired the little old gentleman with a wicked
twinkle in his watery eyes.
“ Quite,” replied Mr, Rumpunch in a subdued
tone.
“ And you believe now that I am the Devil? ”
“ Well, if you’re not the Devil, you ought to be,”
said Mr. Rumpunoh.
“ Then,” remarked Satan—we may as well now
call him by his real name—carelessly pouring him-
self out a cup of beer, “ we understand each other
at last. I’ll give you my proposal in as few words
as possible. While you were out my eye fell on
this ” —and he flipped with his thumb-nail the
schedule which Mr. Rumpunoh had made out
about an hour before.
“ Well ? ” said Mr. Rum punch.
“ 1 think,” observed Satan, “ that you can’t pay
them. I would have a much poorer opinion of
you than I have at present if I thought you had
any intention of paying them. But, of course,
that is not your trouble. Your trouble is that to-
morrow may find you with no roof over your head
and possibly nothing to eat.’
“ Very likely,” said Mr. Rumpunoh gloomily,
“ And what do you intend to do?” enquired
this little red-headed, limp-moustached, watery-
eyed Satan pouring himself out another cup of
beer (it was a good threepenn’orth) and negligently
throwing one of his patched patent leathers on the
table.
Mr. Rumpunoh felt an almost irresistible desire
to get up and pitch him out of the window, but,
remembering what he had seen in the hotel mirror,
wisely refrained. Instead, he answered that he
“ didn’t know what he was going to do —perhaps
drown himself.”
“ That is precisely the mood in which I wanted
to get you,” said the little knock-kneed Evil One.
“You and I can now come to an understanding
which will be to the benefit of both. ”
“ You needn’t ask me to sign my name in blood
or anything like that, you know,” said Mr. Rum-
punch in a tone of alarm.
“Pooh! you have been reading G. W. M.
Reynolds—who, by the way, is now living down
at my place and is very poor. He did more to
perpetuate that sort of nonsense than any other
man of this century. He was always describing
me as a being continually on the watch —in a
black velvet suit, with a cloak lined with red and
a cock’s feather in my cap—for dissolute young
men and others to sell their souls and sign the
agreement in their blood. Ugh ! ugh !” and Satan
chuckled with asthmatic malice. “ I never asked
him to sell his soul, and when he came to me I
had a d d good mind not to let him in. But
he hasn’t such a rosy time of it down there. He
could only harp on the one old string, and there
isn’t a stationer in Sheol who would give him
credit for a sheet of asbestos. I don’t want your
soul. It’s no good to me. What I do want I will
explain afterwards. In the meantime tell me what
you are going to do about your affairs.” And
Satan languidly took out a clay pipe and began to
fill it from the plug on the table.
“What the dev—no offence,” said Mr. Rum-
punch, beginning in an exasperated tone and, as
he remembered who his visitor was, concluding in a
milder one. “ What can I do ? I have no money ?”
“Neither have I,” replied Satan, placidly;
“ I’m dead-broke.”
“And I don’t know where to get any,” con-
tinued Mr. Rumpunoh.
“ Don’t you ?” said Satan, with a sly leer.
“No, I’ll be hanged if I do !”
“ I thought when I gave you that ring you were
a young man of intelligence; I find I was mis-
taken. Can’t you see, now ?”
It flashed upon Mr. Rumpunoh at once.
A man who can make himself invisible when he
pleases need never want for money.
“ Now, light your pipe, and sit down quietly,”
said Satan, “ while I explain my proposal to you. ”
Mr. Rumpunoh obeyed without a word.
“It will be necessary first, in order that you
may understand why I am here in this condition,
that I should give you a brief sketch of the present
constitution of what your mealy-mouthed revisers
call Sheol.”
Mr. Rumpunoh prepared to listen.
Part 111.
“How long have you been up, Mr. Beelzebub?”
enquired Mr. Rumpunoh, seeing that his visitor
had fallen into a reverie.
“ About a month,” was the reply, “but please
call me Mulrooney. It’s the name I go by when
I come up here. I suppose you will be surprised to
hear that I am an Irishman. ”
“Not at all,” said’Mr. Rumpunoh, determined
to express no surprise at anything further he heard.
“ For my own part I always believed that you
were also an Orangeman. ”
‘ ‘ There you are wrong, ” said Satan with a sad
smile, “ they wouldn’t have me. I am not bigoted
enough for them. I am in the Salvation Army—-
or rather I was, till I got expelled for refusing to
kiss the Salvation lasses.”
“ But,” said Mr. Rum punch, “I thought that
the principal feature about the Army was the
down it had on you and all your works. ”
“ Yes, of course, but I never enjoyed myself so
much since the days of the Inquisition—when I
incited that genial old soul, Torquemada, to burn
thousands of infidels every year for the love of
God and the discomfiture of myself—as I did when
I was leading the chorus who were calling me
rdl sorts of hard names, and when I was assisting
in firing volleys of fire and brimstone —as if they
could hurt me ! —at myself. It was tremendous
fun, and might have lasted much longer if I hadn’t
taken too much liquor on board one night and
wanted to fight all hands because the Captain
wouldn’t let me play on the big drum. That and
trying to kiss the Major’s girl, ruined me with the
rank-and-file. But perhaps they wouldn’t have
been so full of glory if they had known whom
they had in their ranks. It is a mighty pious
gathering, young man, where the Devil is not pre-
sent in some shape.” ujanu

“You were going to tell me something
about—hem —the country you come from,” said
Mr. Rumpunoh —“what is it like?”
“ Well, in some things it is as nearly as possible
like South Australia.”
“What things?” exclaimed Mr, Rumpunch,
surprised at last.
“Religion, for instance, and swindling,” was
the curt reply.
“ Religion !” repeated Mr. Rumpunch in amaze,
“ Religion in hell 1”
“Yes, religion—of the South Australian kind ;
respectability if you like. Better still, hypocrisy.
I never noticed it much till the times of the Phari-
sees. _ Up till then we had been the maddest,
merriest company this universe ever saw. It was
a circus all the time. There was no end to the
fun we had and the pranks we played on man-


kind. There never was such a mistake made as
to think we wanted to add to our numbers by try-
ing to entrap the souls of mortals. We were too
happy as we were. All of us knew each other,
and nobody put on airs. It was mortals who came
to us. We didn’t want them. We would have
shut them out if we could. But it was not to be.
The first lot of mortals were right enough—cheery,
sociable fellows, from Cain to Caligula. With
the coming of the Pharisees, however, Hell really
began to be something like what the Melbourne
Presbytery believes it to be. The Pharisees kept
themselves together and assumed airs of superiority
and solemn piety that made the rest of us mad,
but, nevertheless, little by little, began to cast a
gloom over our spirits till, by the time when a
crowd of sour-faced Presbyterians, lank-haired
and bilious-eyed Wesleyans, and fat Anglican and
Catholic bishops and priests, and parsons, com-
menced to flock in, you would think Hell was one
huge conventicle. Psalm-singing was going on
night and day, “God bless our Home” was hung up
over the mission-box, and the plate was continu-
ally passing round. It was the force of habit, I
suppose, that made them do this because there
were no heathens to send missions to, and they
themselves were in Hell already and couldn’t get
out of it. But some of the collections might have
been intended to be applied to the conversion of
me, and Judas, and Barrabbas, and a few others
who had refused to join their religious circle.
They very nearly got poor old Cain away once by
bribing him with the promise of a keg of Phlegethon
punch—a drink he was very fond of—and, when
we surprised them in the act, and induced him not
to go, they made out prohibition-orders against
us and not a publican from Acheron to Cooytus
would serve us with a drink if we were dying for
it. I don’t know what we should have done if it
had not been for a recipe, a journalist of our
party, lately from a place called Lithgow, in New
South Wales, had brought down with him for
brewing colonial beer—which is a liquor fit only
for the d —-1,” said Satan, emptying the last
mouthful of the jug. He could brew it out of any-
thing—indeed that was the painful reason, to-
gether with his erratic views concerning the
British Constitution why he was with us.
# #
“Humpi ” remarked Mr. Rumpunch,
while the Devil paused to cough and catch his
breath, “ yours is a curious story, Mr. Mulrooney.”
“It is perfectly true, however, upon my soul,”
said the Father of Lies, solemnly.
‘ ‘ But how do you and your friends live ?”
“ They have given us a little reservation in the
far corner of Hell —just as your Australian Govern-
ments have dealt with their blackfellows —and we
potter along there as well as we can; but, I tell
you, it is a hard struggle to keep alive.”
Here the poor fellow almost broke down, but,
making a brave effort, pulled himself together,
and continued : “Yes, and if they find us outside
of the reservation they lock us up for vagrancy.
I’ve been locked up myself about six months out
of every year for the last five hundred years. If it
wasn’t for having those poor fellows I spoke of
depending on me for advice and assistance I
believe I’d go right away and commit suicide.”
“Don’t take it to heart so,” said Mr, Rum-
punch, kindly; “perhaps before eternity is over
things will take a turn for the better. By the
way, I thought Hell was a terribly hot place ?”
“ Well, you’ve got to get acclimatised to it; but
I should say it is not much hotter than Cooktown.
All you have to do is to dress in a nice light suit
of asbestos, and you will be quite comfortable. ”
Everyone does so down there, except the British
crowd, who, in that grand, old pig-headed way
which has made them what they are, still wear
thick clothes and plug hats of the kind in fashion
when they were alive in their own foggy island.
As I said before, I’m an Irishman myself.” Here
the Devil knocked the ashes out of his pipe on the
palm of his hand, and proceeded to cut himself up
another pipeful.
* # #
“ There’s another thing about the place
we were speaking of, ” he suddenly resumed, look-
ing at Mr. Rumpunch with a wicked grin, “ it’s
very much like Plato’s Republic in one way.”
“ What way ? ”
“No poets are allowed in it. The last lot that
came down were hanged in a row, with their
poems stuck in their mouths as gags. So you’ll
know what to expect if you continue writing
verses. ”
“ Thanks, ” said Mr. Rumpunch drily, “ T will
make a note of the circumstance. But do you
mean to tell me there are no poets in Hell ?”
“ Certainly not. There are hundreds—but they
take good care to keep the fact to themselves.
Even Byron is mute, and Dr. Watts hasn’t written
a line since he’s been down. The only one who
does anything in this way is Nero, and he writes
hymns, which our religious rulers purchase from
him at so much a sheet. This helps to keep us in
tobacco, at any rate.”
“ What is Nero like?” enquired Mr. Rumpunch
with interest.
“ A very nice young man, but rather too mild
for my taste. He employs most of his time, when
he isn’t writing hymns, in saving flies from drown-
ing, and other actions of a like nature. In ap-
pearance he is very much like a young Anglican
curate. ”
“ And Judas and Cain, what are they like ?”
“ The finest fellows you ever met,” replied the
Devil, with enthusiasm, “jolly, bright-faced
fellows, always cracking jokes and keeping
everybody around them shouting with laughter.
You never saw such a flow of spirits as they
have. They keep us all alive. And kind,
too ! They wouldn’t hurt a fly, though, per-
haps, being more thoughtless, they would hardly
go so far as Nei’o in rescuing flies. There is
only one thing against them ” —here Satan shook
his head sorrowfully— “ the cursed drink. When
we used to take the old-fashioned stuff—naptha
and Phlegethon punch—they were as healthy as
could be wished, but since that new addition to
our party—l won’t mention his name, but he also
ran a near chance of being hanged—began to brew
colonial beer, they have been falling off at a ter-
rible rate. I don’t suppose,” said Satan, brushing
a tear from his eye with his ooat-sleeve, “that
poor, old Judas will last much longer than half-
past eternity. Cain drinks harder, but he has a
stronger constitution. If I could only get them to
take the cerulean blue ribbon !” With which
remark Satan, overcome by grief, and beer, and
rum, lurched off his chair and fell under the table,
where he lay snoring stertorously till morning.
Mr. Rumpunch threw an old overcoat over him,
noticing at the same time that his feet were
clothed in one white stocking and one red one,
and then flinging himself on his own bed, went to
sleep thinking what a curious experience it was to
be lying in the same room with the Devil.
Part IV.
Early the next morning Mr. Rumpunch was
disturbed by his visitor shaking him by the
shoulder.
\ What’s the matter now ?” he growled, not
carmg more than any of the rest of us would to be
disturbed at such a time.
“ Rum, turn! can’t you get some rum some-
where?” said the Devil, and Mr. Rumpunch
noticed that he was shaking like a jelly.
“ No,” was the reply spoken gruffly enough, for
Mr. Rumpunch was very much in need of a drink
himself ; “I have no money and no credit.”
“But the ring—you have the ring !” exclaimed
the Devil.
Mr. Rumpunch was, as I said before, a good-
natured and naturally honest young man with the
best of intentions. Vet see what the craving for
drink will do. He dressed himself without a
word and went out with a lemonade-bottle.
“ I will only do this for a joke,” he said —but he
came back with the bottle full of rum. He had
not paid for it, and nobody had seen him take it,-
This was the first step on the slippery descent of
Avernus, and Beelzebub Mulrooney smiled with
malicious satisfaction—as far as his feeble face
could convey such an expression—when he noticed
that Mr. Rumpunch had taken it.
* * *
“And now, my boy,” said Satan cheer-
fully, after he had refreshed himself twice and put
his head under the tap, ‘ 1 we will to business.
I’m afraid I was not quite so coherent as I might
have been last night. But when you live through
several thousand aeons you will find out that there
is plenty of room in eternity to sober up several
times. To business first, though—and after that
breakfast.”
Mr. Rumpunch sat down on the edge of his bed
and waited.
“Well,” said Satan, “I gave you a pretty fair
idea last night of how things are where I came
from.”
“Yes.”
“ Now, then, I wish to tell you that that is why
I am up here. You see we can’t go on much
longer—l mean our little crowd—as we have been
doing. There is too great a majority against us.
Besides, I expect a lot of eminent divines down
below pretty soon, and I know they’ll make Hell
altogether too hot for us. What I want to do,
then, is to increase our own circle by a lot of
recruits from up here. I want first-rate repre-
sentative men, and it will be all one to them, as
they will, most of them, go to the same destina-
tion in any case. But we want to make sure of
them for our party, you see. The fact is,” here
the Devil lowered his voice to a whisper, “we’re
getting tired of Cain’s jokes—there is too much
about the mule in them, and the wombat who
edits a country paper, and the leading article that
falls on the head of a compositor and kills him
because it is so heavy, and the dude who sucks his
cane-head and can’t see over his collar, and the
man who slips on banana-peel, and the blaek-
baby-eating alligator, and kerosene-tins in connec-
tions with goats, and the effects of Mackay rum in
connection with snakes. Gain has been telling
those to us for over six thousand years now, and
they begin to grow a bit monotonous. Truth is, ”
and hero he dropped his voice to a low whisper,
“ I’ve been thinking that the best way we could
break up the rule of that glum-faced gang down
there would be to publish an Asbetos Bulletin.”
“Yes,” said Mr. Rumpunch, dubiously; “but
how are you going to get the writers and the
artists ?”
It was good to see Satan then. He threw him-
self back in the rickety chair. He haw-hawed and
ho-hoed till his face grew purple, and he began to
cough and choke. After his paroxysm was over
he repeated, “How to get the writers and artists ?
Ho, ho ! Ha, ha !”
Mr. Rumpunch clapped him on the back with a
boot, or he might have gone off into another fit.
“Why, confound it!” he said, “these fellows
will all come to me of their own accord. I have
half-a-dozen of ’em already, and d—d fine drinkers
they are. Ha, ha ! Ho, ho ! Ugh, ugh !”
When he had concluded his cachinnation he con-
tinued in a more serious tone; “You see, Mr.
Rumpunch, what we want is a number of solid
souls who will give a certain tone to our, at
present, somewhat Bohemian, not to say reckless,
community.”
“ There are Patterson, for instance, and Bent,”
suggested Mr. Rumpunch, “they should suit
you.”
“Perhaps,” replied the Devil, doubtfully, “ but
I would rather have some of the men named in
this list. ” And he took out a slip of greasy paper
from the lining of his hat.
“ Now,” he went on, “ as I told you before,.
I want from you no such nonsense as signing your
name in blood. All I want you to do is to take
these names and offer to each person mentioned
the dearest wish of their hearts if they will sign
one of these little agreements.”
Here the Devil drew out of the inside .pocket of
a goat-hair waistcoat he was wearing, an order-
book, something like those which insurance agents,
carry.
“ Take this,” he said, “ and go on and we’ll soon
be our old selves again.”
“ But what about me ? ” asked Mr, Rumpunch.
“You?” said the Devil, “Oh, you ? I ask noth-
ing from you barring this little service for the.
inestimable advantages the Ring of Invisibility—
which is yours for the rest of your life, will bring
you—the little service to go and see these men and
get their signatures to these orders in return for the
secret and cherished wish of their hearts. There
wHI be no difficulty because I have never known
a man and (on rough calculation) I have known
more than would, placed in serried square, stretch
farther than from the earth to the sun in this
little parterre of stars, to which the great sun
around which your poor, little gum-drop of a solar
system rolls—the great sun in the constellation
Hercules—is as the Earth to a pigeon’s egg, that
would not, when caught at the right moment, sell
his soul seven times over for the possession of j
something or other always foolish which he i
desired to possess for the span of their poor, little
ephemeral life.” j
“Yes, and you?” said Mr. Rumpunch, with a?
sardonic smile.
“ I admit it,” replied the Devil, hitting his poor, |
little, thin, brown hand on the table till the
knuckles ached. “If it had not been damned
long ago, I would have sold my soul a fortnight
ago for the smiles of a cook. But I went round to !
see her one night ” —here his voice sank into a sob j
—“and—l found her sitting on the knee of a-
policeman ! I reproached her. She gave me in
charge and —he locked me up! No more cooks
for me. They say I send them and that another
power sends meat. One more lie as far as my part j
in the matter is concerned. If I did send cooks I !
would send them sober —and I have never seen a
sober (female) cook yet. But to return, have you
read the names on that slip ?”
“I have,” replied Mr. Rumpunch.
“ And you agree to do your best to get the sig-
natures for me ?”
“ What are the terms?” asked Mr. Rumpunch,
cautiously.
“Anything you like,” replied Satan, impa-
tiently, “as long as we can go now and get break-
fast.”
* * *
After a breakfast at Parer’s, which they
negotiated by simply passing out invisibly after
they had eaten it, Satan said: “Look here, we
must have some more drink. It is Christmas time,
and though it is anything but a joyful season for
me, yet, after the fashion of the man who drinks
more heavily because he has lost at the races than
the man who drinks because he has won, I would
like to celebrate it. Let us operate with the ring. ”
Ten minutes later they were seated in a brewery
filling themselves up as fast as they could with
beer out of a quart-pot which sto.d on top of a
barrel set aside for the use of visitors.
Of course they were invisible.
The curious part of the affair, however, was that
the Devil could not make himself invisible unless
he was in company with the possessor of the Ring
of Invisibility.
“ Tell you what it is,” he said, after they had
been there a couple of hours, drinking like whales
all the time —“ I’m afraid to taste much more.”
“ Why ? ” enquired Mr. Rumpunch with a reck-
less hiccup.
“ Well, the truth is,” said the Devil, “ I’m
afraid. I’ve had ’em before and I might get ’em
again. ”
“ Get what ? ” asked Mr. Rumpunch scornfully,
glug-glugging another potful down his throat.
“ The blue devils ! ” whispered Satan huskily.
“ What have you got to be afraid of ’em for? I
thought you were the head Devil.
“Yes, that’s all very well,” replied Satin, “but
I can’t stand snakes /”
* * *
The end of this little shivoo was that Mr.
Rumpunch parted company with the Devil —lost
him mysteriously.
Mr. Rumpunch at the same time (to him) quite
as mysteriously lost the slip with the names of
prominent people inscribed on it and their dearest
wishes written in a clerkly hand opposite each
name.
He was at first discouraged by this, but in a few
minutes with the careless audacity that comes of
colonial beer said to himself that “ it didn’t matter
—he (hie) remembered the names right enough
and what each party wanted.”
As I remarked in a previous part of the narra-
tive, it was a day or two before Christmas and
much was forgiven to persons who, in the excess
of their enthusiasm, somewhat overstepped—or
shall I say overstaggered ?—the limits of propriety
during this season of universal gladness.
Mr. Rumpunch, therefore, being fairly well-
dressed —albeit his black frock-coat had been
inked around the edges many times, and his boots
(under his own eye) carefully patched almost as
often, not to mention that he was wearing cheap
but clean cuffs and collar on a cheap but clean-
coloured shirt, and that his tall hat looked as
though it had been—in mistake for his boots —
furbished up before he left home with patent
leather polish, and his trousers were more pic-
turesquely than fashionably ravelled at the
bottoms —was allowed by the placid guardians of
the peace to lurch unmolested through the streets
with a gauzy eye fixed on some object unseen to
others in the far distance, and the other eye closed
as if engaged in solemn introspection.
He was allowed to pass, as I have said, but
Satan (poor devil!) was looked up on a charge of
being drunk and disorderly before he had gone
two blocks. This was because his boots were bad
and the rest of him sadly squalid in the candid
light of day.
Such is the irony of the so-called Christian
era.
# # *
Mr. Rumpunch arrived at the office of
Mr. Munro, M.L.A. and Teetotal Chief, and,
turning the ring round his finger, staggered in
unseen and plumped into an easy chair on the
side of the table opposite to where the great Chief
in person was sitting, engaged in making a rough
draft of a withering speech he was going to deliver
before the Y.M.C.A. against the Accursed Drink.
Now there was one point about the wonderful
ring which it is as well to mention.
When the stone was turned inwards the wearer
became invisible—but not inaudible.
Therefore, when Mr. Rumpunch rent the quiet
air of that sober office with a fusiloilade of hic-
coughs, Mr. Munro jumped in his chair as if he
had been shot.
“Sh’ all right,” said Mr. Rumpunch, turning
the ring round, and making himself visible.
Then he took out his order-book and, in a husky
and malarious voice, explained what he wanted
Mr. Munro to do.
“ Y’ave only,” he said to that gentleman, “f
sign this slip, and y’ll get dearest wish y’r heart.
I know what you want. You want fust-class
hotel central part city. ”
“ Leave this room instantly, you drunken scoun-
drel !” yelled the Chief of the Teetotallers, seizing
a ruler. Seeing the ire in his eye, Mr. Rumpunch
quickly made himself invisible, and, vacating his
chair, got into the furthest corner of the room,
wondering what under the firmament was the
matter.
Yet it was simple. He had merely transposed
in his muddled brain the dearest wish of Mr.
Stutt, of the V.U.L.V.A., for that of Mr. Munro,
of the Victorian Alliance.
“P’rapsh only hish way —wansh berrer terms—
try em again,” he muttered.
But at this moment a knock came to the door,
and in marched a deputation of total abstinence
leaders, who had come to interview Mr. Munro in
connection with the next move to be made in the
j temperance campaign. They sat down and began
ito talk earnestly.
Suddenly their remarks were interrupted by
another fierce volley of hiccups.
Mr. Rumpunch could not have helped it to save
his life.
1 The total abstinence leaders looked at each
other suspiciously, and then at Mr. Munro, who
):grew very red in the face but said nothing.
1 They went on with their talk again, and Mr.
I Rumpunch, beginning to comprehend dimly that
[ there was something wrong, tried to stifle his
[hiccups, though, in doing so, he nearly choked
himself.
' But colonial beer is stronger than good inten-
sions.
| Some odd half-smothered explosions escaped him,
I the sound of which Mr. Munro tried to drown by
• coughing behind his hand,
Fatal mistake.
! The total abstinence leaders concentrated their
i gaze on him and he felt that he looked guilty.
At last Mr, Rumpunch, unable to hold himself
i in any longer, gave vent to a discharge of whoops
I that reverberated round the room.
Mr. Munro nearly burst a blood-vessel trying to
cough the noise of them down.
“Sh’ only Krishmish crackers,” stuttered Mr.
Rumpunch, feeling desperately ashamed of himself
but trying to pass the matter off with a feeble
attempt at jocularity.
He forgot, however, that he was invisible.
It was enough.
Without a word the total abstinence leaders took
up their hats and left the room, throwing a scath-
ing glance at poor Mr. Munro as they passed out.
“ This man that was the guiding star and beacon
light of the cause drinks grog,” was the thought in
k'the hearts of each.
Mr. Rumpunch was thoroughly sobered by this
time, and, without a sound, slipped out of the
door and away as hard as his legs would carry him
to his den in Fitzroy, where he buried his head
under the bedclothes and cursed himself to sleep.
# * *
For a day or two after this he refrained
from offering anybody the dearest wish of his
heart. Instead he made an easy and (as times go)
tolerably honest living by gliding into churches
after the collection had been made and walking off
with the plate (filled with threepences, perchance in-
tended to be devoted to the conversion of the poor,
benighted heathen), lifting money from the coun-
ters of banks while the clerk was telling it out to
some depositor, and other ingenious games. The
result was that on Christmas Eve he found him-
self well up in funds and able to purchase the
materials for a royal dinner on the morrow.
As lie strolled through the streets, looking in at
every window he passed and admiring its contents,
a feeling of tranquil joy came over him to think
that the world was a good place after all, for a
man with a little money, to live in, and Australia
the best part of it. He even wished for a moment
that he had a large family, so that he could till
their stockings with presents, and say Santa
Claus had sent them. In the midst of these bene-
volent musings he turned round a corner and met
—the Devil.
He was looking poorer and more miserable than
before, and a shocking black eye, and a scar across
his nose did not add to his beauty.
“ I’ve been hunting for you everywhere,” he
said, “ I haven’t had a drink for two days, and
I’ve slept in the gardens for the last couple of
nights. They turned me out of the Model Lodging
House because I couldn’t get up when their hideous
gong rang, about two hour s before daybreak. Have
you any money ? I must have a drink. ’
“How did you get that awful face?” asked
Mr. Rumpunch as they dived into the obscurest
hotel he could find in Little Bourke-street.
“ Got it this way. I borrowed a few shillings
from the editor of «a religious paper here, who is
an old friend of mine, and took a girl to the
theatre. When we came out between the acts to
get a drink, a big mounted rifleman came up and,
after giving me a black eye, knocked me down and
kicked me, and then walked off with the girl, who
went away giggling. I’m always in trouble, I
am,” holding an old handkerchief to his swollen
optic, “I wish I was dead and buried in the
Chinese Cemetery.”
Mr. Rumpunch began to suspect that the Devil
was a slave to drink, and that that was the real
cause of his ruin.
That caused him (Mr. Rumpunch) to reflect
seriously.
If beer (and rum) could make such a miserable
wreck of what had once been a gifted and power-
ful Being, what chance would he have against it ?
It would be absurd, how'ever, to turn teetotaller
on Christmas Eve. “ I’ll see to-morrow, though,”
he said to himself, “ and then I’ll turn over a new
leaf.”
After making this good resolution he asked the
Devil to come and take his Christmas dinner with
him.
* * *
In what words shall I describe that dinner ?
The jokes that accompanied the carving of the
turkey and the spooning-out of the savoury
stuffing—the flashes of wit that followed the glug-
glug of the bottled Foster —the droll and wicked
stories that Satan told when the fourth bottle
began to look shallow and their cigars were lit!
The old proverb says—“ He who sups with the
Devil should have a long spoon.” Mr. Rumpunch
soon found out its fallacy. Weak and ricketty
as the old man looked, Mr. Rumpunch came to
the conclusion, before the feast was finished, that
the proverb should read —•“ Ife who drinks with
the Devil should have an armour-plated stomach
and a steel head.” All things must come to an
end, however, and so did this wonderful dinner.
Some time afterwards Satan, highly elated by
what he had eaten and drank, wanted to go to
church, and it was as much as Mr. Rumpunch
could do to dissuade him. “I want to hear what
they’re saying about me,” he said. “ Some of
those parsons are sure to be abusing me and_ calling
me ugly names—as if I wasn’t their best friend!”
* * *
Eat why prolong the story ? The end can
be told in a few lines. Mr. Rumpunch found
that his good resolution was of no account. He
made new ones every morning and regularly
broke them at the first hotel he came to. There
was a demoniac fascination in the ring that
dragged him, struggle against it as he might, into
bars and banks, and everywhere that money or
beer could be obtained. He felt that he was fast
becoming the slave of the ring. In the midst of
his degradation, however, he had still some sparks
of higher feeling left. He vowed that he would
never again attempt to entrap any man’s soul
through its agency. He even tried to lose it. He
buried it in the ground, he pawned it, he went
down to the wharf and threw it into the river, he
made a present of it to a Jewish bookmaker —but
all in vain. He had no sooner got rid of it, as he
thought, for ever, than looking at his finger again
he would see it there sparkling as though it had
never been taken off. He began to think the
stone looked with malicious triumph at him —that
it was alive—that it was the eye of a fiend. As if
this was not torture enough, the Devil haunted
him wherever he went wanting money for drink.
On one occasion, driven to desperation, he tried to
kill his tormentor with an axe. The blow passed
through him and smashed the chair he was sitting
on, but he got pip unharmed, and putting, his
odious face, with" its wicked watery eyes, close to
poor Rumpunch’s gibbered at him like a ghoul.
He felt he was going mad. He did go mad and
tried to drown himself, but whether it was in
virtue of possessing the ring or not he never knew
—try as he would, he couldn’t sink. A boatman
fished him up and carried him to the wharf, where
a Salvation Army captain was preaching at the
time. The good captain, on hearing his story,
told him not to be afraid. The Army would soon
settle the hash of the Devil for him.
Two* or three days after this a young man,
dressed in a red jumper, and wearing a cap with a
red band on it, might have been seen passing in
and out of a Salvation Army gathering, energeti-
cally selling War Obys. It was Mr. Rumpunch.
All at once he felt an eye fixed on him, and he
knew his tormentor was beside him.
“Ungrateful dog!” yelled the Fiend. ■ J “ You
shall suffer for this. ” But Mr. Rumpunch sprang
into the middle of the crowd, and made a sign to
the man with the big drum. The band imme-
diately struck up, and the Devil fled gnashing his
teeth. “I can stand anything but that,” he was
heard to say. Several of the spectators —sober
and reputable persons—state that they saw him
disappear, riding on what seemed to be an ice-
cream cart. But the ring has never been seen
from that day to this, and, it is to be hoped, never
will. Mr. Rumpunch is now a steady, sober young
man, and teaches a Sunday-school. But he will
never, as long as he lives, forget the Ring of
i Invisibility and his Christmas Dinner with the
Devil.


Branded.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
SWOONING hot
mid-summer day,
We sweltered in our
sweat
From dawn until the
glaring sun
Reluctantly had
set;
He glared upon us as
he sank
As tho’ against his
will;
He went to bed, as
tho’ he’d like
To stay and scorch
us still.
All day we worked
and cursed the
smoke
The sullen brand-
fires made ;
The gum-trees’
withered, shri-
velled leaves
Gave precious little shade—
What with the dust, the heat, the smoke,
We all were pretty cross,
But no one grumbled, for we had
A devil of a boss.
Bill Jackson was the boss’s name,
A lawless cove was Bill; *
His jockey, Yellow Bob, was there,
His breaker, Richmond Will.
Old bow-legged Jim, the boundary-boy,
The driver, Joey Crewe,
And I, a man of no account,
The new-chum jackeroo.
And Johnny Hardwicke (quite a kid)
A crazy Vernon boy—
These were the chaps that Bill, the boss,
Had then in his employ.
Since early dawn we ail had worked
Like niggers in the yard,
With heat a hundred Fahrenheit;
The “graft ” was pretty hard.
I grieve to say our work was not
According to the law,
But well we knew that for that lot
Bill did not care a straw.
I'm sure if we essayed it now
It would be called a crime,
But it was common in what some
Still call “the good old time ; ”
Young cattle that were not our own
We branded by the score—
It was a thing that most of us
Had often done before—
But little Jack, the Vernon boy
(A trifle “off his dot ”)
When told to brand the stolen calves
Says bluntly, “No, I’ll not! ”
Says he, “I will not be a thief —
God says, ‘ Thou shalt not steal. ’ ”
Says Bill, “You booby, do your work,
Or, by the Lord, you’ll feel!”
(I guess we were a bit surprised
To hear the youngster speak,
And tho’ we did not like his jaw
We all admired his cheek.)
Says Bill, “ Get on and do your work,
Or I will tan your skin !”
Says Hardwicke, “ I will brand no more,
For it would be a sin.”
“ You won’t !” says Bill. “ I’ll not !” says Jack,
Ere we could stay Bill’s hand
He pinned Jack’s face against the fence
And on it pressed the brand !
And all the words that I may write
Would never serve to tell
The awful pain that Jack expressed
By that one piercing yell.
Bill, laughing like a demon, held
The brand upon his cheek—
The blood gushed out and turned to steam,
Lord ! how poor Jack did shriek !
We pulled Bill off while Hardwicke roared
With choking, gurgling hiss,
“You murd’ring dog ! you fiend of hell !
I’ll have your blood for this !”
Bill laughed, a rasping kind of laugh,
But turned a trifle red—
“Go home and get your mug tied up,
You blooming flat,” he said ;
“And if you wish to save your skin
You’ll do as you are bid, -
Or you may cut your coffin-wood,
My fine, religious kid.”
Jack, vanishing, on Bill bestowed
A parting look of hate ;
We finished work in silence then
And got home pretty late.
Jack was not home, and tho’ we searched
The bush for miles around
For many days, the deuce a sign
Of Jack we ever found—
We found no trace of little Jack
On swamp or flat or hill,
And some there were who scrupled not
To blame his death on Bill.
But Bill said often : “ I feel sure
I’ll meet that kid some day,
And know him, too, because he’ll wear
My cattle-brand 3J.
From what I know of branding calves
The pain they have to stand,
I don’t think, of his own free will,
That boy will fake the brand. ”
Well, years went quickly fleeting by
fTim« «on**how vitn '♦ tUnH •(■ill)
And changes come lo all mankind,
So changes came to Bill.
He owned a station further back,
He took to him a wife.
And, like the nigger in the song,
He “ led a different life ”
Was not that reckless, careless chap,
He was not half so wild
(It seems to tame a fellow down
To own a wife and child).
He dandified himself a bit,
He very seldom swore—
In fact, was quite a different man
From what he was before.
And all the hands who worked with us
On that remembered ’day
Were dead, or lost, or disappeared,
Or somehow passed away,
Save Yellow Bill, the jockey-boy,
(Bill sometimes trained a horse)
And I, who then was jackeroo,
Promoted now to boss.
Well, Bill and I were nearing home
One autumn eve from town,
Quite pleased we’d hit the market well
With stock we’d taken down ;
Bill had been talking of the past—
“ The only thing I did,”
Says he, “ of which I feel ashamed
Was branding that poor kid.
It’s strange we never found a trace
Of him for all we tried—
I often lie awake at night
And wonder if he died;
I’d like to know what came of him
I’d give a hundred quid
To know I had not spoilt his life,
Poor, lonely, friendless kid.”
Well, talking thus we rode along,
And, when not far fromTiome,
Met Yellow Bob on Bill’s best horse
'c V
Full speed and white with foam.
Bad news was Bob’s—a tribe of blacks,
By some armed white man led,
Had stuck the station homestead up
And shot the super, dead.
Through sable foes old Bob, the jock.,
Somehow contrived to bolt,
And, with a spear-wound in his back,
Escaped on Bill’s best colt.
Bill gasped, thro’ parched and bloodless lips :
“Oh, God preserve my wife !”
Then off, at break-neck-pace, he went,
As if for very life.
I need not tell of deep suspense
That gnawed us as we rode —
Our horses only seemed to crawl
Tho’ tip-top pace they showed.
Arrived at home—the place was dark—
We passed the shattered door,
And stumbled o’er a silent heap :
Bill’s wife upon the floor;
Alive, thank God ! She soon revived,
But wild and haggard-eyed—
“ My child, my child, they’ve killed my child,”
In piteous tones she cried.
’Twas Hardwicke—who we all supposed
Was numbered with the dead—
That, thirsting for revenge on Bill,
The murderous niggers led !
We sought him, armed, in killing mood,
But sought him all in vain,
For what had happened years before
Now happened once again.
Bill would have skinned him, so he swore,
But he had disappeared ;
We found him not, he hid as well
As if from earth he cleared.
We found (which almost sent Bill wild,
Good Lord, what oaths he swore !)
His child marked with the brand ho used
On Hardwicke long before.
Her infant cheek, with blistered marks,
Was horrible to view;
Tho dainty skin all seared and burnt,
The VJUwJ
'Twas thus that Hardwick fed, at last,
His wild, unholy hate—
Revenge comes round to every man
Who has the strength to wait.
Ulmarra.
JACKARANDALO.
The Priest’s Dinner.
One of the best-known Irish R.C. priests
of the early days of Victoria was the late Father
Courtenay. He had seen a lot of life on the dig-
gings, and was chock-full of queer old yarns. At
a “spread” given to him on one occasion, up-
country, when he had to speak of the unbounded
generosity of his flock he mentioned that he had
never been mistaken in his people’s liberality, except
on one memorable occasion. It was this ; He first
took possession of the Presbytery at Murdering
Gully on a Saturday night. The next morning a
twelve-year old “ gurrl ” presented herself at the
priest’s house and handed in a fore-quarter of
mutton in a tin-dish. “‘Well,’ sez I to myself
‘ they’re beginning early. ’ ” Shortly afterwards a
six-foot digger turned up with a leg of mutton
supported by peeled potatoes. “‘They mean I
shall have plenty of victuals, anyhow,’ sez I to my
servant man.” He had hardly made the remark
when a woman who spoke vehemently in Irish
(which the priest couldn’t understand, Heaven
forgive him !) made an oration over a dead rooster.
Father Courtenay took this as a formal
welcome to Murdering Gully, and made a
brief but gracious acknowledgement in the
tongue of the “base and brutal Sassenach.”
He had just retired to jot down the pearls of his
first sermon to the kind but barbarous miners of
the Gully, when a bootless lad handed in a piece
of beef, which was quickly followed up by a pig’s-
cheek donated by a man with one eye and a
wooden leg. Then followed dishes of dumplings,
treacle-puddings, rabbit-pies, and all sorts of
things till the table groaned—and so did the
priest. Then there came a calm ; and it was the
first time that Father Courtenay thought it was
possible to have too much of a good thing—all at
once—particularly as many of the articles pre-
sented to him were eminently perishable—in hot
weather. Well, after Mass, he was more aston-
ished than ever when the old Irishwoman called
again and kicked up a furious row. With the aid
of an interpreter, Father Courtenay ascertained
that she demanded to get back her deceased
rooster ! The priest began to philosophise on the
volatile nature of human benignity, when the
bare-footed youth presented himself with a jaunty
salutation: “ Want the beef, mister, and look
sharp !” Then came the timid little girl with,
1 Please, sir, I called for the forequarter.” “Here
it is, me gurrl,” says the serving-man, “an’ tell
yer ma, like a nice little child, to be hanged to
her and her durty generosity ! ” and as the
dumbfounded little maid turned the corner of
the house, up came the long digger with
the goatee. “ That leg o’ mutton, boss, plaze,”
sez he, addressing the coachman,, who was stand-
ing at the garden gate. Well, Mick, the man, was
exasperated-like, and sez he : “ What the divil did
you bring it here for, at all, if you wanted it
back?” Sez Mike: “D’ye suppose me and the
priest kem hero to be made omadhauns of?”
Hearing signs of a mighty storm, Father Cour-
tenay presented himself upon the scene to prevent
a breach of the peace and a scandal. He arrived
just in time to hear the digger demand of the stable-
man : “Then what the blazes d’ye mane by hang-
n’up that there thing on the fence?” The priest
and his man followed the digger’s digit and be-
held, hung upon the garden railings, a piece of
board upon which was neatly painted the words
“DINNERS BAKED DAILY.” The matter
was at once placed in the hands of the policeman,
when it was ascertained that on Saturday night
the looal_ sign-writer had, while in a beastly state
of intoxication, hung upon Father Courtenay’s
fence an “order” whinh h* wm taking home to
An Idyll of Dandaloo.*
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
On Western plains, where shade is not,
Neath summer skies of cloudless blue,
Where all is dry and all is hot,
1 here stands the town of Dandaloo—
A township where life’s total sum
Is sleep, diversified with rum.
Its grass-grown streets with dust are deep,
’Twere vain endeavour to express
1 he dreamless silence of its sleep,
Its wide, expansive drunkenness.
The yearly races mostly drew
A lively crowd to Dandaloo.
I here came a sportsman from the East,
The Eastern land where sportsmen blow,
And brought with him a speedy beast
A speedy beast as horses go.
He came afar in hope to “do”
The little town of Dandaloo.
Now this was weak of him, I wot —
Exceeding weak, it seemed to me—
For we in Dandaloo were not
The Jugginses we ’peared to be ;
In fact, we rather thought we knew
Our book by heart in Dandaloo.
We held a meeting at the bar,
And met the question fair and square—
“ We’ve stumped the country near and far
lo raise the cash for races here ;
We’ve got a hundred pounds or two—
Not half so bad for Dandaloo
“And now, it seems, we have to be
Cleaned out by this here Sydney bloke,
With his imported horse; and he
Will scoop the pool and leave us broke.
Shall we sit still, and make no fuss
While this chap climbs all over us ?”
Ihe races came to Dandaloo,
And all the cornstalks from the West
On ev’ry kind of moke and screw,
Game forth in all their glory drest.
Ihe stranger’s horse, as hard as nails,
Look’d fit to run for New South Wales.
He won the race by half a length—
Quite half a length, it seemed to me—
Dut Dandaloo, with all its strength,
Roared out “Dead-heat!” most fervently ;
And, after hesitation meet,
The judge’s verdict was “Dead-heat !”
And many men there were could tell
What gave the verdict extra force :
I he stewards, and the judge as well—
I hey all had backed the second horse.
I or things like this they sometimes do
In larger towns than Dandaloo.
They ran it off; the stranger won,
Hands-down, by near a hundred yards.
He smiled to think his troubles done ;
But Dandaloo held all the cards.
They went to scale and—cruel fate !
His jockey turned out under-weight.
Perhaps they’d tampered with the scale )
I cannot tell. I only know
It weighed him out all right. I fail
To paint that Sydney sportsman’s woe.
He said the stewards were a crew
Of low-lived thieves in Dandaloo.
He lifted up his voice, irate,
And swore till all the air was blue;
So then we rose to vindicate
(( The dignity of Dandaloo.
“ My friend,” said we, “you must not poke
Such oaths at us poor country folk. ”
We rode him softly on a rail,
We shied at him, in careless glee,
Some large tomatoes, rank and stale,
And eggs of great antiquity—
Their wild, unholy fragrance flew
About the town of Dandaloo.
He left the town at break of day,
He led his racehorse through the streets,
And now he tells the tale, they say,
To every racing-man he meets.
And Sydney sportsmen all eschew
The atmosphere of Dandaloo.
THE BANJO.
* Which the name of the place was not Dandaloo but
Dandaloo is melodious and rhymey.
Here is a very pathetic incident, which lias
been known to move strong men. It transpired
at Goldsborough, near Dunolly (Vic.) in ’86. The
White Horse Company was sinking on the Birth-
day line. One day, just before “knock-off,” the
braceman—a dreamy individual of alcoholic habits
— dropped his spanner down the shaft, greatly to
the detriment of Philip O’Daley, who was indus-
triously delving below. Poor Phil, was badly
damaged about the head, and when brought to the
surface was quite unconscious. Whilst the boys
were carrying the injured miner across the pad-
dock to his little home on the outskirts of the
township, the boss ran on ahead to break the news
to his wife. Now, although Mr. and Mrs. O’Daley
agreed pretty well in general, there were times
when Philip smote his spouse with considerable
force. Mr. O’D. was something of an epicure in a
humble way, and when his victuals were not up to
expectations he impressed his con victions on Mary’s
mind withmuch variegated profanity and a “skelp”
or two. The boss found Mrs. O’Daley bending
anxiously over a composite dish of some kind
Which she was testing with a spoon. He gravely
hinted at impending difficulties, and earnestly ad-
vised the lady to be calm and bear up. “ F what’s
wrong ?” queried the housewife, anxiously. “Is
O’Daley off dhrinking?” “Worse than that,” re-
plied the boss. “ He has been hurt at the mine,
and is being carried in here unconscious.” “ On-
conscious !” exclaimed Mrs. O’D., dropping the
spoon and heaving a pro r ound sigh of relief.
“ Onoonscious, is it ? Ooh, then ! Misther Burins,
H mn'S'ht- »v bin th' »ht«w'» Rhmolrud •"


The Scapegoat.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
We have all of us read how the Israelites fled
From Egypt with Pharoah in eager pursuit of ’em,
And Pharoah’s fierce troop were all put “in the
soup ”
" The Israelite horde went roaming abroad.”
When the waters rolled softly o’er every galoot of
’em.
The Jews were so glad when old Pharoah was
“had ”
That they sounded their timbrels and capered
like mad.
You see he was hated from Jordan to Cairo —
Whence comes the expression “to buck against
faro. ”
« -fco/hm. ■&'//} Jc/P* //up/-
“ Did they choose their best goat?”
For forty long years, ’midst perils and fears
In deserts with never a tramline to follow by,
The Israelite horde went roaming abroad
Like so many sundowners “out on the wallaby.”
When Moses, who led ’em, and taught ’em, and
fed ’em,
Was dying, he murmured “ A rorty old boss you
are :
I give you command of the whole of the band
And handed the Government over to Joshua.
“ The day it has come, with trumpet and drum."
But Moses told ’em before he died,
“ Wherever you are, whatever betide,
E/ery year as the time draws near
By lot or by rote choose you a goat,
And let the high priest confess on the beast
The sins of the people the worst and the least,
Lay your sins on the goat ! Sure the plan ought
to suit yer,
Because all your sins are ‘ his troubles ’ in future.
Then lead him away to the wilderness black
io die with the weight of your sins on his back :
" Quite floored the Rabbi."
Of thi ist let him perish alone and unshriven,
lor thus shall your sins be absolved and for-
given !”
;Tis needless to say, though it reeked of barbarity
nSj scap e g oa t arrangement gained great popu-
~Tsy this means a Jew, whate’er he might do,
lol *g i he burgled, or murdered, or cheated at
100,
Or meat on Good Friday (a sin most terrific) ate,
Could get his discharge, like a bankrupt’s certifi-
cate.
Just here let us note —Did they choose their best
goat ?
It’s food for conjecture, to judge from the picture
By Hunt in the Gallery close to our door, a
Man well might suppose that the scapegoat they
chose
Was a long way from
being their choicest
Angora.
In fact I should think
he was one of their
weediest ;
’Tis a rule that obtains,
no matter who reigns,
When making a sacrifice
offer the seediest;
Which accounts for a
theory known to my
hearers
Who live in the wild by
the wattle beguiled,
That a “stag” makes
quite good enough
mutton for shearers.
Be that as it may, as each
year passed away,
A scapegoat was led to the desert and freighted
With sin (the poor brute must have been over-
weighted)
And left there—to die as his fancy dictated.
The day it has come, with trumpet and drum.
With pomp and solemnity fit for the tomb
They lead the old billy-goat off to his doom ;
On every hand a reverend band,
Prophets and preachers and elders stand
And the oldest nihbi, with a tear in his eye,
Delivers a sermon to all standing by.
(We haven't his name—whether Cohen or Harris,
he
No doubt was the “ poisonest” kind of a Pharisee.)
The sermon was marked by a deal of humility
And pointed the fact, with no end of ability,
That being a Gentile’s no mark of gentility,
And, according to Samuel, would certainly d—n
you well.
Then, shedding his coat, he approaches the goat
And, while a red fillet he carefully pins on him,
Confesses the whole of the Israelites’ sins on him.
With this eloquent burst he exhorts the accurst —
“ Go forth in the desert and perish in woe,
“ The sins of the people are whiter than snow!”
Then signs to his pal “ for to let the brute go.”
(That “ pal,” as I’ve heard, is an elegant word,
Derived from the Persian “Palaykhur” or
“ Pallaghur ”),
As the scape-goat strains and tugs at the reins
The Rabbi yells rapidly “ Let her go, Gallagher!”
The animal, freed from all restraint 1
Lowered his head, made a kind of a feint,
And charged straight at that elderly saint.
So fierce his attack and so very severe, it
Quite floored the Rabbi, who, ere he could fly,
Was rammed on the—no, not the back—but just
near it.
The scape-goat he snorted, and wildly cavorted,
A light-hearted antelope “out on the ramp,”
Then stopped, looked around, got the “ lay of the
ground,”
And made a bee-line back again to the camp.
The elderly priest, as he noticed the beast
So gallantly making his way to the East,
Says he : “ From the tents may I never more roam
again
“ If that there old billy-goat ain’t going home
again.
He’s hurrying, too ! This never will do.
Can’t somebody stop him ? I’m all of a stew.
After all our confessions, so openly granted,
He’s taking our sins back to where they’re not
wanted.
We’ve come all this distance salvation to win
agog,
If he takes home our sins—it’ll burst up the
Synagogue!”
He turned to an Acolyte who was making his
bacca light,
A fleet-footed youth who could run like a crack o’
light.
“ Run, Abraham, run ! Hunt him over the plain,
And drive back the brute to the desert again.
The Sphinx is a-watching, the Pyramids frown on
you,
From those granite tops forty cent’riea look down
on you—
Run, Abraham, run ! I’ll bet half-a-crown on
you. ”
So Abraham ran, like a man did he go for him,
But the goat made it clear each time he drew
near
That he had what the racing men call “ too much
toe ” for him.
The crowd with great eagerness studied the race—
“ Great Scott ! isn’t Abraham forcing the pace—
And don’t the goat spiel ? It is hard to keep sight
on him,
The sins of the Israelites ride mighty light on
him.
“ The crowd with great eagerness studied the race”
The scapegoat is leading a furlong or more,
And Abraham’s tiring—l’ll lay six to four !
He rolls in his stride ; he’s done, there’s no
question !”
But here the old Rabbi brought up a suggestion.
(’Twas strange that in racing he showed so much
cunning),
“ It’s a hard race,” said he, “ and I think it
would be
A good thing for someone to take up the running.”
As soon said as done, they started to run—
The priests and the deacons, strong runners and
weak ’uns
All reckoned ere long to come up with the brute,
And so the whole boiling set off in pursuit.
And then it came out, as
the rabble and rout
Streamed over the desert
with many a shout —
The Rabbi so elderly,
grave, and patrician,
Had been in his hot
youth a bold metalli-
cian,
And offered, in gasps, as
they merrily spieled,
“ Any price, Abraham ! Evens the field !”
Alas ! the whole clan, they raced and they ran,
And Abraham proved him an “ even-time ” man,
But the goat —now a speck they could scarce keep
their eyes on
Stretched out in his stride in a style most sur-
prisin’
And vanished ere long o’er the distant horizon.
Away in the camp the bill-sticker’s tramp
Is heard as he wanders with paste, brush, and
notices,

“But the goat stayed behind him—and 'scoffed up ’ paste.”
And paling and wall he plasters them all,
“ 1 wonder how’s things gettin’on with the goat,”
he says,
Then pulls out his bills, “Use Solomon’s Pills ” ;
“Great Stoning of Christians! To'all devout
Jews ! you all
Must each bring a stbne—Great sport will be
shown ;
Enormous Attractions ! And prices as usual !
Roll up to the Hall ! ! Wives, children and all,
For naught the most delicate feelings to hurt is
meant! ! ”
Here his eyes opened wide, for close by his side
Was the scapegoat : And eating the latest adver-
tisement !
One shriek from him burst—" You creature
accurst! ”
And he ran from the spot like one fearing the
worst.
His language was chaste, as he fled in his haste,
But the goat stayed behind him —and “ scoffed
up ” the paste.
With downcast head, and sorrowful tread,
The people came back from the desert in dread.
“ The goat—was he back there ? Had anyone
heard of him?”
In very short order they got plenty word of him.
In fact as they wandered by street, lane and hall.
“ The trail of the serpent was over them all.”
A poor little child knocked out stiff in the gutter
Proclaimed that the scapegoat was bred for a
“ butter.”
The billsticker’s pail told a sorrowful tale,
The scapegoat had licked it as dry as a nail;
He raced through their houses, and frightened
their spouses,
But his latest achievement most anger arouses,
For while they were searching, and scratching
their craniums,
One little Ben Curbed, who looked in the flow’r-
bed,
Discovered him, eating the Rabbi’s geraniums.
“As soon said as done, they started to run.”
Moral :
The moral is patent to all the beholders—
Don’t shift your own sins on to other folks’
shoulders;
Be kind to dumb creatures and never abuse them,
Nor curse them nor kick them, nor spitefully use
them ;
Take their lives if needs must—when it comes to
the worst,
But don’t let them perish of hunger or thirst.
Remember, no matter how far you may roam
That dogs, goats, and chickens, it’s simply the
dickens,
Their talent stupendous for “ getting back home.”
“ Discovered him eating the Rabbi’s geraniums. ”
Your sins, without doubt, will aye find you out,
And so will a scapegoat, he’s bound to achieve it,
But die in the wilderness ! Don’t you believe it !
THE BANJO.


The Warrior’s Dream.
A FRAGMENT OF AUSTRALIAN HISTORY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
PSP
His name was Brown. That was his
father’s fault.'® He was knock-kneed, and Nature
may be debited with that. He dwelt in a Phillip-
street boarding-house and as he never paid we
may fairly debit Brown with that achievement.
But he joined the Volunteers and hung his red
coat and the hacked sabre of his sire (his father is
a saw-sharpener and
knows how to nick a
blade) right at the entry
of the hall. Come in
when you would—whether
fi-om a meeting of the
Quakers or from a solemn
discussion with Under-
taker Kirby as to the
mental condition of
hearse-horses —come in
when you would, and in
what humour you would,
before you had hung
up your hat on the peg,
there before you was the
pomp and circumstance
of glorious war. The
very mosquitoes turned
scarlet in the gory at-
mosphere. It was fare-
well to thoughts of blue
sky, rippling waves,
balmy gales, and honest
industry. You were at once where
“ Furious Frank and fiery Hun
Shout in their sulph’rous canopy.”
yc *
Brown loved Priscilla, who had money.
All the Browns love Priscillas with money ; and
he turned his warlike prowess to her infatuation.
Many a night as we wandered around the shores
of the Beautiful Harbour, trying to work off some
valentines, or sell a time-payment distress-warrant,
have our reflections on the nebular hypothesis
been turned in the direction of advocating canni-
balism when the bass notes of the uniformed and
warlike Brown’s voice floated near. “ And in the
matter of Khartoum, dear Prissy, there is displayed
by the Imperial authorities an unspeakable igno-
rance of the simplest principles of strategy.
Colonel Richardson or Colonel Roberts could
not show crasser incompetence. But strategy
apart, had I the lead of that relieving force —
never mind.” Here Wellington Brown would
withdraw his amorous biceps from the feeble
waist he was supporting ; drop down on one knee
and fix himself in the attitude of preparing to re-
ceive cavalry. And Prissy would blush and mis-
take his warlike glare for a proposal of marriage,
and say “ Wait awhile, dear, wait till you get the
rise of five shillings. We may be happy then.
Two pounds with economy is ample.”
* * *
We fellow victims of the stony chop and
the clammy potato had different views concerning
the valour of Brown. On Friday morning,
February 13, 1885, we were ranged around the
steaming board. Five tradesmen, two commer-
cials, and a pressman—ourselves —that makes eight
appetites, all told—grimly grappled with three
chops from some animal or animals of an unknown
fauna. For the rest, one pot of mustard with a
bone spoon gone green half way up the handle,
and unlimited new, spongy bread and tea made
the festive board and the boarders groan. Brown
was expatiating on the cowardice of Britain. “ I
could wish for no other path to glory,” he said,
“ than to lead a band of my countrymen through
blood and slaughter and thunder to the very gates
of Khartoum.”
“ Hullo, what’s this? ” said the largest bagman
of the pair, opening the morning paper and read-
ing aloud ; “ Mr. Dailey, Acting Colonial Secre-
tary, has telegraphed to the Imperial Government
offering to send to Suakim immediately, 500 men,
200 horses, and two or three batteries of artillery.
He is of opinion that our men and horses being
accustomed to a hot climate (and the Soudan is
the hottest in the world) could render valuable
services at this juncture ” —ahd then the malicious
reader, passing the wink round, manufactured his
tale as he went on, while every eye was fixed on
Brown. “ This offer, it is certain, will be ac-
cepted. ' In the meantime all volunteers are to
hold themselves in readiness for immediate ser-
vice. Mr. Dailey is determined that at this criti-
cal period of the Empire’s history, every man who
has had the advantage of volunteer training at
the expense of the State, shall forthwith settle his
private affairs and be prepared to die for his
country. The Arabs are a bloodthirsty race, and
the fighting will be keen. The desert march will
also tax our men to the utmost; and care must be
taken that ample food may be provided to enable
our brave fellows to sustain their part in the
bloody fray, There is sure to be deadly hand-to-
hand fighting—the gory bayonet against the blood-
dripping lance of the fanatic savage. Mr. Dailey
has the name of every volunteer before him, and
to-day each man will have to report himself to the
Commandant.” Brown had a piece of potato on
his knife half-way to his mouth, but it never
reached that orifice. A deadly pallor spread over
his face, and “Water!”—“a doctor!” was the
cry as Brown dropped senseless on the floor.
* * *
Three days elapsed. The lodgers came
and went noiselessly. The landlady and the
nurse moved softly around the sick room driving
out the mosquitoes with a, broom and anon throw-
ing open the balcony windows to let in fresh air to
Brown’s fevered brow, and to whisper down to the
baker or the butcher that it was no dashed use ;
he’d have to wait till next week. Brown was still
delirious, and he muttered softly to himself in
tones of anguish and horror : “ Oh, why did I
ever join ? To die —jabbed through the body with
a spear—a cold spear, ugh ! Ears cut off—hoo !
Hot sand, bad water, dysentery, ugh ! —curse the
Empire; what’s the Empire ever done for me ?
Pop that uniform —ha, this is more like it. Safe
here. D glory ! Nice man to come to Prissy
“ AS SOON AS IT WAS DARK I POPIED UP MY HEAD, AND NEVER SHA [?] I FO GET THE
HORRIBLE SCENE!”
with one leg and an eye jabbed out ! Oh, mother,
mother dear, make me a child again, just for to-
night !” But at last the crisi s passed and Brown
got better. As soon as he was able to face it, he
c ailed for the paper and saw the hoax. And then
to a fellow warrior who had arranged to clear to
Fiji as a stowaway, he poured forth his fever
dream.
* * *
“ My first dart, ” said this intrepid man,
“ was to roll up a swag and go rail-splitting, but I
remembered that it meant damper and hard work.
My next was to get up near a station and lodge in
a hollow tree and sally out at nights and catch
opossums and dig roots and scour around the
hen-roosts of the home station. Then I fixed
on painting myself black and getting into the
Aboriginal station to
ting Sankey’s hymns and
study the origin of t \e
half-castes. I thought of
joining in with a decent
tame wombat, or working
into a rabbit burrow until
the clouds rolled over —
I would even have taken
a reportership on the
Nooze. But all was in
vain. We were mustered
at Circular Quay. The
Orient steamers were in
waiting. Prissy was there
in tears. Hundreds of
us with our teeth chatter-
ing, and knees knocking
together (for war is awful,
you know, bullets,
sabres, bad bacon, bare
feet, sleeping out, and
walking in hot sand, when
a fellow has been used
to regular meals and a
clean shirt). Off we went,
bands playing and people
cheering, but I could
distinguish nothing. On
the voyage the biscuits
were mouldy, and the
frozen beef got hot in the
tropics. We landed at
Suakim and were at once
surrounded by 10,000
frantic Arabs. Most of
us found time to burrow
down two feet in the sand
on the beach, but all the
others met a fearful death
on the field of battle, and the Arabs started to
lunch on the mortal remains. As soon as it was
night I popped up my head, and never shall I
forget the horrible scene! Large fires were kindled,
and around them, with their faces lit up by the
glare, sat groups of bearded demons feasting on
the roasted bodies of our comrades. We heard the
commander give orders to roast all others but
Presbyterians—the latter were to be put in pickle
and reserved for transit, they being of a closer fibre
than the rest. The horrid saturnalia lasted a week.
In the meantime we under the sand subsisted on
crabs and shrimps. By the end of the week the
Arabs had grown enormously fat, and for a
farewell gorge cne epicurean suggested that as they
were tired of roast, they should vary the menu with
baked Christian. Without a thought these sturdy
savages began to dig holes in the sand, and pitch-
ing in the bodies to cover them with coals. At
last a shout rang through the camp. “ Ho, ho,
boys—here’s a go, Australian frozen meat!” and
I knew that all was over. One of us was dug up
with the point of a baycnet. The whole country
mustered to the spot. One after another my
comrades were discovered and roasted where they
were. I only was left. I dug down three feet,
but I knew my turn was coming.
* * *
The Arabs had now grown so corpulent
that they were unable to move. I crawled out
one night, robbed a sleeping sentinel of what
change he had, and with no guide but Provi-
dence, started for Khartoum in hopes of finding
a benevolent asylum or retreat for old and
worn-out military men. My dream here gets
mixed. I was chased by alligators, speared by
Kaffirs, had my ears eaten off by ants, and had
snakes crawling up inside the legs of my trousers.
I was becoming delirious, for I thought I saw a
serpent with the Evening News in his hand.
Then I was dying of thirst, and when I reached
the water I fell down and broke my leg before I
could crawl near. I was chased by buffaloes, and
trampled on by elephants, and at last when I
reached Khartoum, Gordon ordered me to be
flogged as a deserter, and then handed me over to
the Mahdi to be hanged as a spy. In short, con-
eluded Brown, “ I suf-
fered the torments of the
/l "' 1 No more war
for me !”j
* *
Feb. 19th. Moon-
light. Lady Macquarie’s
Chair. Military man in
full uniform with lady
leaning on his arm : “And
all through my illness
Prissy—through dreams
of carnage, but one vision
was before me—glory !
But my chance will come.
I long to join the bloody
fray, and return to my
own beloved with my
country’s praises ringing
in my ears.” “And do you
think you will go, Welling-
ton?” asked Prissy,
softly. “I go where glory
waits,” replied the feiocious Brown.
* * *
Then he got back at his lodgings, and
hung up his sword and uniform in the hall.
“ Wonder how the deuce I can resign ? Another
shock like this and the house of Brown will be
extinct.”
Only one man voted during a recent Local
Option poll in Dunedin, and he is believed to have

The Miner’s Right.
A TALE OF DESERTED DIGGINGS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
When I visited this year, 1889, the town
of Bundulla, a town with a fair front street,
counterlined by roofless bark shanties, my par-
ticular publican, in answer to a query, advised me
to have my washing done by the “ Miner’s Right.’
Thinking this was a new system of payment, or a
steam laundry, I asked him how that was man-
aged. “Oh! there’s an old woman at the back
we call the Miner’s Right, and she takes in wash-
ing. You should see her. She’ll tell you how .-he
got the name.” After lunch, armed with a billy
of she-oak and a plug of tobacco, I fossicked out
the old lady in question. The woman’s own
words are just as short as mine, so listen :
* * *
“.I’ve been on every diggings I’ve had a
chance to get at and now I’m stuck up in this
awful hole. I’ve had five husbands, or supposed
husbands, all diggers, and I believe one is still
alive. You can guess I came from Tasmania—l’m
an old lag—a Red Rover. I cooked for gentle-
men and men who were not gentlemen in Tas-
mania long after I got my ticket and my freedom,
and when Ballarat broke out I saw my chance
and took my old man to the diggings. He
dug and drank, I took in washing and drank.
He was killed in a fight. Then I took up with
another, and came to Sydney side. I always
kept their miners’ rights and looked after
them for my customers. I’ve got hundreds of
them, and I always did well till I came to this
fraud cf a place, where there’s no lead, only
patches. I got the name of ‘ Miner’s Right ’ be-
cause I’ve no colour in my face, and a young swell
from home said : ‘Good Lord! her skin is made of
miners’ rights ;’ and so it is, and my body too.
I’ll never get out of this. I only earn about seven
shillings a week. The fiddler next door only
earns about ten. The publicans are all insolvent,
and waiting for a stray catch like you ; and
the men are waiting for a rush close handy and
won’t prospect. I don’t know what they live on.
The young natives are' all sharpers with nobody to
sharp. A man came last week and gave me 10s. for
permission to examine all my old licenses and
rights. He picked out one and offered a pound
for it. If it’s worth a note it’s worth more, so I
wouldn’t sell. He’ll be back again. The fiddler
knew the man on Lambing Flat, whose right it
is. He was a young swell. There’s money there.
At any rate I’ll chance keeping it. Trust the
fiddler to fossick out all about it. He’s only 60,
and I’m 84. Well, yes, I’d rather have the shil-
ling, and your things will be ready to-morrow and
cost you Is. 9d. Good-day and good luck to you! ”
* * *
So I left the parchment woman, but if I
settled in or near Bundulla I’d have many a pitch
with the Miner’s Right.
SCOTTY THE WRINKLER.
The Veteran.
He was grey-bearded, and sixty, and dry
as Wilcannia, and had to sit down on a bench in
the corner and give reminiscences of the days of
Captain Cook and Marco Polo until he was husky
and mad. And all the while the perspiring hod-
man came in and planked his threepence and
squared his elbows to the foaming beaker, and the
old Scotchmen took their stuff “ neat ” and
smacked their lips, and the pressman came in
just to borrow a match
and get shelter from the
shower. “Yes,” said
the old man, eyeing the
man of ink and thinking
he might “hold it” —
“yes, they may talk about
soil, but how does it
happen that all the
coasts of England and
Ireland and France where
the North Pole current
comes down, are more
fertiler than lots of places
where there’s good soil ?
Why, I seen it years
ago in Chambers’ Infor-
mation for the People,
that in Kerry, where
there’s no more soil nor
there is on the palm of
that hand (un f ortunate
illustration), the grass has
been known to grow two
inches in one night.”
“But,” said the landlord,
filling out a pint fra
blacksmith and not
heeding the old veteran’s
drought, “the cur-
rent that comes down
from the North Pole
is cold. Now, how
is a cold current going
to make ground more
fertile than a place
inland?” “That’s where
you don’t understand
astronomy,” said the old
man, walking up and
taking a matcli. “If you
knowed as much about
jography and astron my
as you do about beer,
you would be more
scientific. ” ‘ ‘ Perhaps you
mean the Gulf Stream —a
warm current,” said the
landlord. “Don’t mean nothing, of the kind,” ho
replied, coming over and appealing to the press-
man ;“ now I’ll ask this gentleman—pardon me,
is this your beer ?—no, thank you, I’ll join you
directly ; but I want to finish this argument.
What I say is this : The poorer the soil of a
country is, the more fertile it becomes, when the
yield is greater. That’s plain enough ; and you
can see it any day you like in Chambers’ Infor-
mation.” “ Did you ever see mushrooms growing
so as you could see ’em move ?” put in a lumper.
“ Hold on a bit,” he resumed, “ you see this gen-
tleman’s pint of beer? Well (taking it up), suppose
I had, for the sake of illustration ’F—“ Give him
one,” said the pressman, nervously'clutching his
vessel. “ Now here, for example,” he continued,
blowing off the froth and settling down to a pro-
found consideration of it ” —“Oh, bah, wha’s use
talkin’ science here ? Bless me ! what I say is,
read Chambers’ Chambers’ Inf’mash’n Peo-
plesh.” And then sweet sleep his eyelids closed.


Flowers for the Dead.
AN UP-COUNTRY SKETCH.
I HAD a most singular adventure laslf month. It
came about in this way. I was stopping at
Bose Hill, one of the biggest stations on the
Queensland Downs, with my friend Davis, the
manager. Hamilton, the nearest township, is
about 35 miles off, and, having business there,
I got the loan of a horse from him, intend-
ing to ride over. I had never gone before,
but the road seemed very simple. Rose Hill
is a cattle-station in the middle of sandy but
well-timbered country. It is quite wild; very
little of it being fenced off, the cattle of one station
constantly straying on to the others, which gives
considerable trouble at stock-taking time. Eight
miles to the south you strike on the line of mail-
coaches. This was the point I missed. In the
forest lands, rich with green boughs, there was a
diversity of tracks, and I somehow managed to
light on the wrong one. Without getting abso-
lutely bushed, I found myself compelled to stake
my chance on a direct cut through the scrub
in the direction of the line. The sun was
setting as I struck it. All chance of losing
myself was now over. The telegraph runs down
the middle of the long straight “lines” for miles
and miles right into Hamilton. Furthermore, the
whole character of the country suddenly changes.
A great, grey, treeless plain, infinitely monotonous
and dreary, replaces the scrub, just as black soil
replaces the sand.
As I came out from the trees, a band of
misty powdered pink and gold all along the
western horizon sky on my right—with the sun
at the base of a great dense, pallid cloud—told
me I should not be in Hamilton till late. I
was hungry and very thirsty, not having had a
drink since two o’clock. The “lane” was little
more than a brown, bare, rectilineal passage, whose
sole ornaments were the telegraph-poles and wires
running exactly down its middle, and the skeletons
and carcases of sheep, or of some poor, patient
bullock who had done something more than his
duty. Suddenly the sun dropped from behind
the cloud, whose rim had been glowing with
an intense brilliancy, and flooded the whole plain
with golden light. Then, almost as suddenly, he
was gone, and I was riding along in the bronzing
and rapidly darkening of the stealthy evening.
Much riding or driving over the treeless plains
occasionally afflicts one with a kind of stupor. The
stars come out marshalling their array more and
more thickly. The strange sounds of the desert by
night—the inexplicable breathings and rustlings,
the pursuits and captures of the unknown spirits
of eartli and air, the fantastic figures and shadows
of crouching, attentive animals—l have never
been able to rid myself of its_ sombre and weird
glamour. There is no animal life, to speak of, in
these plains now. The kangaroo, the emu, the
dingo, are all gone. The ground-lark and his foe,
the hawk—a stray hare, or a quail whizzing away
from your approach; these, and the huddling
mobs of the wild, timid, yet inquisitive “mon-
keys ” are all that meet you. The great alluvial
steppes, with their ground-showers of volcanic
pumice-stones, are like a Head Sea of eai th in
these latter days of drought and denudation.
The inevitable way these thoughts, with others
of a really superstitious character, took hold of
me, annoyed me. Even ray horse was stirred by
something and broke away from that horrible
station shuffle of his—that cross betwixt canter
and trot which is the usual gait of hacks and
Chinese coolies. The monotony of the plains
ceases at night.' The ground-wind becomes a
person and raises its head towards the crowding
stars The carcases and skeletons seem agitated
with' a fitful breath of being. The dry bones do
not veritably live, but they seem to feel once more
the electric currents of life thrilling through and
through them. Why should the evil odour of dead
animal-matter be so different at night? Ihe
ffliosts of wistful bullocks, aware of the greed and
tyranny of mankind, standing nnpotently hostile
to me as a member of the dominant race, inade me
laugh, and yet I recognised a certain reality that
was disquieting. And all the while hunger and
thirst gnawed at stomach and mouth, and the
miles to the belt of trees which surrounded the
township seemed something more than intermin-
able.
But all things end at last, and, as the lane
suddenly broke into the line of trees, both horse
and rider brightened up, and the stirring
strains of ‘ ‘ St. Patrick’s Day in the Morning ” were
(rather inappropriately, it is true) whistled out
cheerfully into the dark. Still six or seven miles
to go, but already in front of me I could see lights
—the lights of some house that was the outpost
of kindly civilised men living in community
together.
As I came closer I was struck by the number
and brilliancy of these lights. Their position
enabled me to guess the shape of the house. Not
that there is much difficulty in doing that in the
bush. We have not got out of the primitive stage
yet, when a house is conceived of as a box, divided
into four parts with doors and windows in equally
symmetric simplicity. Thus, I readily concluded,
when I saw a clear light with two stars of light
on the near side Of it, that this was an ordinary
bush-house divided into four parts with a front
verandah ; that the further front-room (the sitting
or dining.room) was well lit up, while the nearer
front-room or nearer back-room (probably bedr
room) had a candle or lamp in each. The further
back-room was, of course, out of ray range. I
cannot tell what set me off speculating about the
construction of this house, unless it were that I
had already made up my mind to stop and ask at
it for a drink of water.
At this point, when I was sixty or seventy yards
away, I perceived by an added light suddenly ap-
pearing between the two first ones, that someone
had opened the door. Then that someone became
apparent to me. I have keen sight, and the cir-
cumstances were propitious. I saw in a moment
that it was a woman clad in white, with a candle
in her hand. The great breadth of the road and my
elevated position on horseback gave me an excel-
lent view. I was surprised ; then a little startled,
but held on, keeping my gaze fixed on her.
She was standing on the verandah—on the edge
of the verandah. I was struck by her vague atti-
tude. The light of the candle which she held
fitfully illumined her face.
There was not much breeze out in the open
plain. Here in the scrub there was little or none.
The candle dickered and burned steadily, with a-
regular alternation. What was she about? She
seemed heedless of everything. The sound of my
horse’s hoofs must now have been distinctly
audible to her. I crossed the road and came along
the fence, all the while keeping my gaze fixed on
her.
She held the candle loosely, letting it hang for-
ward. She was in her night-gown, a long night-
gown that reached to her feet. Her hair, long and
thick, was all about her neck and throat. Her
head was sunk back, as it were, into her shoulders,
which stooped forward and seemed marrow.
As I drew up at the gate, the candle steadied
for a moment and I saw her face distinctly. The
look of her eyes was enough. I concluded at once
that she was either walking in her sleep or mad. I
sat there and watched her. _
She seemed irresolute, now turning a little back-
wards to her left, now making as if to advance.
Her feet were moving uneasily, as if feeling their
way forward. The verandah had one step, and it
was a big one. Several times she felt out and
down with her bare foot. Then her mind seemed
to be made up. Down she came.
She was now in the path and almost six yards
from me, directly facing me. It was a little
garden with four beds divided by two cross-paths.
The beds had shrubs and flowers in them. She
turned off along the cross-paths to my right, and,
with her back to me, stooped over the far bed,
plucking flowers and leaves with one hand, hold-
ing the candle in the other. I sat and watched.
Presently she put the candle down on the path,
and went on plucking flowers and leaves with
both hands, rather promiscuously, till they were
full. Then she stopped and seemed to consider
for a moment. I could hear the deep sigh she
heaved as she gathered up her night-gown into her
lap and put what she had gathered into it. She
then went all along the first bed, and then, turn-
ing along the second, faced me now quite re-
gardless of the candle. I sat and watched.
The second bed done, she passed by the flicker-
ing candle and came along the path to the front
bed on my right. I could have touched her once
or twice, she was so close.
From the third bed she went to the fourth, and
then, seemingly satisfied with her gathering,
slowly came back into the centre path and went
up into the balcony. I decided to follow her. It
appeared to me the best thing to do under the
circumstances.
I got down quickly, opened the gate, shut it,
tied the bridle to the top, and turned to the house.
The sound of my horse moving about seemed to
have arrested her attention. She was standing
on the verandah with her head thrust forward,
listening. In my hurry I almost ran up against
her. We were hardly a yard apart.
I felt somewhat embarrassed. Yet it was quite
clear that she did not see me. Nevertheless I
averted my eyes, looking aside at the candle on
the path, which was guttering.
With a glance at her I stepped to it and took it
up. She seemed satisfied that there was no one,
and, with her slow, peculiar movement, the shoul-
ders bowed and the head sunk back into them,
turned and went in by the door. I followed.
It was a narrow passage opening by two
doorways into the side rooms and running on
by a third door into one of the back rooms. All
three doors were open, and light proceeded from
each, though faintly from that at the end of the
passage. She took the door immediately on the
right and entered. I followed.
The first thing that struck me was the fact that
there were a great number of candles lit in it.
They were ranged everywhere. The next thing
was a bedstead, a stump bedstead, draped all in
white with sheets, and running across the end of
the room on the left. Upon the bedstead, covered
with a single sheet, was the corpse of an old
woman.
The girl was now standing between me and the
face of the corpse, but I had caught one glimpse of
it, and it was ghastly. Utterly bloodless, yellowy-
white, with the veins big and blue all over the
brow, the sunken eyes half covered with the
waxen lids, the tight brown lips drawn back from
the long teeth, it was the figurement of incarnate
death. I was a little horrified, but irresistibly
attracted. I neither advanced nor retreated. I
stood still, candle in hand, and looked.
Then the girl began to speak. At first I could
not, or did not, catch the words, but I felt they
were a child’s wail of pity over some unhappy per-
son or thing.
“ Oh, poor thing, poor thing, poor thing!” she
said. “ Oh, poor thing, poor thing, poor thing!”
She lifted up her face and began to sing. It
was one of the songs children learn to sing in
chorus. She sang it absolutely as a child would,
with just the same tone and regular marking of
the time. I only remember two lines of it—
“ Buttercups and daisies,
See the pretty flowers 1”
And with that she began sorting out her flowers
and leaves to put a nosegay of them on the pillow
beside the ghastly face. . . ~,
I drew closer, until I stood at the foot oi the
bedstead, and there I watched it all like a man in
a miraculous dream. , .. ,
She did not end talking and singing until she
had strewn all the flowers about the face ana
shoulders of the dead body. ..
“Robin red-breast, robin red-breast,” she said,
“becomes to bury the dead people. The poor
things, the poor things ! Do not forget the dead
people. Be kind to the dead people, be kind to
the dead people! The poor things, the poor
things!” .
When she had done, she drew back and, say nig
several times “Good-bye, poor thing, good-bye .
slowly turned and went to the door. I gave one
parting glance at the nose and teeth thrust up
through that confused shower of green and colour,
geraniums, white verbenas, petunias, and a mis-
cellaneous collection of leaves, and followed her
down the passage and to the door of the second
back-room, which was in the middle of the parti
tion on the left, and was open, with light proceed-
ing from it. She entered this.
I came to the door-way, _ putting the candle
down on the table that was in the middle of the
room, and looked in.
It was a bed-room with a large double bed in it.
Two young girls lay in the inside of the bed, fast
asleep. A candle was on the chest of drawers at
the foot of it. _
These two girls did not strike me as being the
sisters of the first one. They were dark in hanr
and complexion, and of a much slighter build.
Neither did they resemble one another.
The sleep-walker paused a moment at the edge
of the bed and looked round. Then she lifted up
the clothes and got into the bed with the others.
They moved uneasily and spoke a little in drowsily
peevish tones, but in a few moments all three
lay there side by side, close up to one another,
breathing tranquilly, fast asleep.
What should Ido ? Was there anyone else in
the house ? It seemed not.
I blew out the candle and went back along the
passage and looked into the room opposite the
drawing-room.
A candle burned on a chest of drawers in it,
and I could see where the bedstead ha,d been.
Otherwise it was empty. I stepped into the
verandah, and thought for a few moments. Then
I crossed the path, unhooked my bridle, undid the
gate, shut it behind me, mounted my horse, and
rode away.
That was the adventure I had last month, and
you will agree with me that it was a most singular
one.
FRANCIS ADAMS.
“Clancy of the Overflow.”
[F OR THE BULLETIN.]
I had written him a letter which I had, for want
of better
Knowledge, sent to where I met him down the
Lachlan, years ago,
He was shearing when I knew him, so I sent the
letter to him,
Just “on spec,” addressed as follows, “ Clancy,
of ‘The Overflow.’”
And an answer came directed in a writing unex -
pected,
(Which I think the, same was written with a
thumb-nail dipped in tar)
’Twas his shearing mate who wrote it, and verbatim
I will quote it:
“ Clancy’s gone to Queensland droving, and we
don’t know where he are.”
In my wild erratic fancy visions come to me of
Clancy
Gone a-droving “down the Cooper” where the
Western drovers go;
As the stock are slowly stringing, Clancy rides
behind them sii ging,
For the drover’s life has pleasures that the
townsfolk never know.
And the bush hath friends to meet him and their
kindly voices greet him
In the murmur of the breezes and the river on
its bars,
And he sees the vision splendid of the sunlit plains
extended,
And at night the wond’rous glory of the ever-
lasting stars.
I am sitting in my dingy little office, where a
stingy
Ray of sunlight struggles feebly down between
the houses tall,
And the foetid air and gritty of the dusty, dirty
city
Through the open window' floating, spreads its
foulness overall.
And in place of lowing cattle, I can hear the
fiendish rattle
Of the tramways and the ’busses making hurry
down the street,
And the language uninviting of the gutter children
fighting,
Comes fitfully and faintly through the ceaseless
tramp of feet.
And the hurrying people daunt me, and their
pallid faces haunt me
As they shoulder one another in their rush and
nervous haste,
With their eager eyes and greedy, and their stunted
forms and weedy,
For townsfolk have no time to grow', they have
no time to w r aste.
And I somehow rather fancy that I’d like to change
with Clancy,
Like to take a turn at droving where the seasons
come and go,
While he faced the round eternal of the cash-book
and the journal—
But I doubt he’d suit the office, Clancy, of “The
Overflow.”

A Trip to England in a Mall Steamer, by Phil May.


The Washerwoman of
Jacker's Flat.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
The extreme disparity in the number of male
and female denizens of J acker’s Flat was a
source of sore discontent to the former. That
refining influence which fair women are said to
exert over rude mankind was a long-felt want
on Jacker’s Flat, as, out of a population of twelve
hundred and odd, only nine were of the feminine
gender. Four of the ladies were mated —a reveren-
tial regard for beautiful truth forbids us saying
married —and one of these stultified the glorifying
womanly attribute to a great extent by persisting
in a course of intemperance, and rarely appearing
abroad, excepting under the stimulus of rum.
Deduct from the five of the softer sex who remain
unallied, so to speak, three under the age of six,
and that the malcontent of the men was a rational
grievance becomes patent to the
meanest understanding. It has been
said that where women and children
are few, men of affectionate natures
lavish their surplus sentiment on
the lower animals This character-
istic did not prevail on Jacker’s
Flat —indeed, experience has taught
us that elsewhere as there men so
circumstanced invariably cleave to
the intoxicating cup, and abandon
themselves to the seductive wiles
of euchre, crib and Yankee-grab.
The few dogs of the camp were
lean and debilitated, of a furtive
habit, and noted for their agility
in dodging missiles ; the cats were
unkempt and fearful, and much dis-
posed to abandon civilisation for the
joys of a wild, free life on Mount
Miamia; but there was not a pack of
cards or a dice-box on that flat that
did not bear unmistakeable traces of
good handling and long attention,
and Monkey Bill, otherwise Mr.
William Monk, the local publican,
had no just cause to c mplain that
the worshippers at the shrine of
the god set up in his temple,
“The Pick and Barrow,” were
wanting in numbers or in religious
zeal. However, these joys are vain
and meagre substitutes for the com-
panionship of lovely woman and
small wonder that the sign-board
hung out before the new tent down
the creek should excite pleasurable
anticipations in the susceptible
breasts of the bachelors of Jacker’s
Flat. The sign itself, apart from its
terseness and the originality of its
orthography, was not an object of
the deepest interest, for it was
merely the bottom of a candle-box
on which were inscribed with a ball
of blue in large, irregular capitals
that staggered across the board at
independent angles, two words,
“ Washing Did. ” Neither was the
eloquent message which this laconic
advertisement was intended to con-
vey calculated to carry any great
amount of satisfaction to the soul
of Jacker’s Flat, for, if truth
must prevail, the negligent diggers seldom had
any washing to be “did,” as many of them,
reckless in the pride of big yields, utterly aban-
doned a “rig-out” when once its appearance
called very loudly for soap and water. Others
acknowledged but one limit to the time an
article might be retained in wear without
washing, and that was regulated by the dura-
bility of the garment in question. Economy
commended this latter usage, and it was most
popular. No, the sign had a deeper, a more
sacred import to the lone diggers : it announced a
very welcome addition to the one-sided population
of Jacker’s Flat and signified —A woman. What
style and condition of woman was the subject of
earnest speculation in Monkey Bill’s canvas bar
on the evening following the first appearance of
the placard. *
“ I hope t’ goodness she ain’t hitched !” moodily
remarked a long, angular man with a phenomenal
growth of red hair and whiskers, who was revel-
ling in the luxury of twist tobacco and raw brandy
—a combination which seemed to suit his taste, as
the “ quid” was never removed to make way for
the liquor, each pull at the pannikin being pre-
ceded, however, by mechanical and voluminous
expectoration. The observation was greeted with
derisive laughter.
“Anyhow, you can’t stand a show, Bender;
I’ll bet a cabbage-tree you’re the ugliest man from
Home!” observed Dick Freen, with refreshing
candour. “You’ve got no luck, old Frightful.
Don’t forget the time when you smiled at Martin’s
daughter on Bendigo and made her horse bolt. ”
“ I don’t, I don’t Dick,” said Bender, as calmly
as if he had been paid a flowery compliment, “ I
ain’t built to please horses —and asses ; but ladies
is different, some of them takes to ugliness ! ”
And the speaker resumed his mastication with
an air of supreme complacence, and passed his
hand feelingly over his nose, which organ had
been badly battered by a blow from a shovel in an
encounter with a “ jumper ” at Dcadman’s Flat in
’52, and afforded no contrast to his natural facial
deformities, which were many and various.
“For my part, I’d rather she were married,”
observed a tall, rather handsome, young fellow,
who was sitting on a bush tableland was rendered
conspicuous by his immaculate rig-out. “Young,
you know, and married to a beautiful youth like
Bender ! ”
“ Well, supposin’ her boss does happen t’ be
anythin’ like Joe Bender ! ” replied that gentle-
man, evidently nettled by the other’s sneer.
“ Supposin’ he is, if he ever catches you sneakin’
round his tent he’ll knock yer stiff for a blessed
crawler! That’s what Joe Bender ’ud do, me
Honorable John, an’ you’d best make a note of it,
case y’ forget! ”
The Honorable John laughed lightly, and turn-
ing his back on the group, entered into conversation
with a digger who was drinking alone in the
shadowy part of the tent. In common with every
other man on the Flat, he believed that it was not
advisable to go too far with Mr. Bender, who
(like every other man with a broken nose) had
quite a reputation as a slogger, and was known to
have knocked out Black Anderson after a tightly-
contested battle of 27 rounds at Specimen Hill
one Sunday afternoon; and although he was
rather proud of his unique ugliness he was pre-
pared to instantly resent any derisive levity,
especially if it emanated from a person like
the Honorable John, whose well-greased Welling-
tons, careful shave, and neatly arranged curls, de-
servedly earned the contempt of four-fifths of the
miners on the Flat.
John Blake could not have been more scrupulous
about the set of his Crimean shirt, or the arrange-
ment of his silk sash and tie, or the curl of his
moustache, had Jacker’s Flat boasted a large as-
sortment of fair maids instead of being limited to
so meagre a female population. With the few
women to hand, however, he was on the very best
of terms. “I’m of good family—and a gentle-
man, by G ! ” was his stock boast. Jacker’s
Flat accepted the statement in good faith, and
dignified him with the title of “ Honorable.”
The man who was drinking alone in the dark
corner was Mr. Stephen Bacon. It was a pecu-
liarity of Mr. Bacon’s that when he was drinking-
in which agreeable recreation he passed most of
his spare time and two or three holidays a month—
he loved to sit alone, as far out of sight as the
shanty would permit, and drink alone —a parti-
cularly detestable characteristic in the eyes of the
average digger. Mr. Bacon was a widower of
three years’ standing, and he drank, it was stated,
to drown the grief occasioned by the loss of his
wife. What terrible woe gnawed at his vitals and
gave rise to an insatiable thirst for brandy pre-
vious to the demise of that lamented lady was
never known, but that it was intense and irrevo-
MR. Bender : “Gentlemen, —Brummy Peters! A splendid fellow.”
cable is proven by the knowledge that Stephen’s
unremitting but ineffectual endeavours to drown
some secret sorrow in large quantities of ardent
spirit was the main factor in bringing his still
young but broken-hearted spouse to her grave. After
that sad event Mr. Bacon was able to start afresh
and found his thirst on a tangible grievance. As
an evidence of the enormous quantity of alcohol a
settled sorrow can withstand, it may be mentioned
that Steve Bacon had not exhaled a breath un-
tainted with brandy for many years. He and
“ Mite ” Power had “struck it” in a hole below the
bend, but Monkey Bill cleaned him out pretty
effectually before each sluicing day came round.
Every night saw him in the shanty, where he
would sit and absorb grog till his hair became
moist and clang to his temples in clammy rings,
and the perspiration oozed from his forehead in
large beads. At which stage, he was wont to weep
great tears of fusel-oil, and call upon his dead wife
in lugubrious tones, or chummer over his sorrow
with drunken dolorousness, till he was warned off
by the forcible curses of the company, or uncere-
moniously ejected by a disgusted digger ; when
he would stagger to his canvas residence and re-
assert his manliness by knocking his only child
down and kicking her for falling.
Cecilia Bacon, known on the Flat as “Ois.,”
was about 17, slight and pale, with very fair
hair, and large, frightened eyes of a light-blue
tint. Her whole bearing was one of excessive
timidity. Of a shrinking, retiring disposition,
imagining herself a burden to her besotted sire,
since the death of her mother her life had been a
joyless one, indeed. She was not an interesting
girl, never associated with the other females on
the camp, and thought she had but one friend in
the world —the Honorable John. He was very
kind; he overcame her bashfulness, walked and
talked with her, and being interested in the
daughter was gracious to the father. Often and
again had that sallow, fragile, awkward girl
stolen into the shanty after midnight to guide the
eccentric footsteps of her drunken parent to his
tent, fearing he might stray into some abandoned
hole and break his worthless neck if left to come
home alone, and almost as often had she been
heartily kicked for her pains.
The fair lady who had condescended to shed the
lustre of her charms on Jacker’s Flat and who awoke
tender anticipations in the breasts of the forlorn
bachelors of that encampment by her preliminary
announcement, made her first public appearance
on the following evening at Monk’s hostelry. The
usual brilliant assemblage was gathered together
in the •“ bar ” of that elegant establishment en-
gaged in the usual convivial pursuits when uni-
versal attention was suddenly withdrawn from
cards, dice, and brandy by the entrance of a
stranger.
An apparition would not have been more start-
ling. A coarse skirt alone identified the stranger’s
sex; she wore a man’s black, slouch hat which
bore palpable traces of having seen long service
“below ” and was trimmed with a narrow leather
belt, she smoked a highly-coloured meerschaum
pipe, the bouquet of which eloquently testified its
strength; she had on a short guernsey buttoned
up the front like a coat ; the sleeves rolled to the
elbow betrayed an arm that might have graced a
navvy—her hair was cropped short and bristled
almost six feet from the floor. Fleshy, broad-
shouldered, and straight as a sapling, her hands
thrust into the pockets on either side of her skirt,
with an air of muscular manliness, the new washer-
woman strolled into the room and up to the
counter, coolly oblivious of the impression she had
created. In a strong, masculine voice she ordered
“stout.” Mr. Monk could scarcely express his
sorrow —he had no stout —didn’t keep it.
The lady calmly anathematised his eyes, cleverly
lumped his soul, shanty, and immediate relatives,
in a brief but comprehensive curse, and made it
gin.
The gin was satisfactory. Then she replaced
her pipe, after throwing off the “nobbier” with
scientific abruptness, thrust her hands into her
side-pockets once more, and, lounging against the
counter in a devil-may-care, intensely-rnasculine
attitude, boldly surveyed the company. Every-
thing about the woman bespoke her manly senti-
ments. Those skirt-pockets were a brazen plagiar-
ism of the refuges for idle hands in the nether
habiliments of the lords of creation, and her upper
lip bore unmistakable traces of an earnest en-
deavour to grow a moustache ; even her distorted
nose seemed to suggest the pugnacious male.
Monkey Bill’s patrons were astounded ; they
gazed at the washerwoman and at each other in
grave surprise, and continued playing their hands
with unwonted solemnity. Bender alone seemed
capable of grasping the situation, and, after con-
cluding the game in which he was engaged, he left
the bench where he had been playing, and ad-
vanced to the new-comer with an outstretched
hand.
“ Brummy Peters !”
“What ! Bender?”
“ That same.”
“ Well, I’m ! ”
After a hearty, hail-fellow-well-met sort of a
greeting, Bender ventured the query :
“ Well, Brummy, how’s things ? ”
To which the lady replied that things were very
slow indeed, emphasizing the assertion with an
ejaculation only admissible in the pulpit, and in-
formed Bender in a casual way that Peters was
no more. Mr. Bender did not seem to think
himself called upon to exhibit very violent grief
over this sad intelligence, he merely remarked :
“ You and Peters weren’t spliced ; were you ? ”
One might think that the palpable indelicacy
of this question would have affected the lady to
anger, but no, it touched only her pride.
“Spliced!” she ejaculated, and all the scorn
she felt for that feminine weakness was apparent in
her voice, “ Devil a fear ! we just chummed in.”
Further conversation revealed the fact that the
late Mr. Peters whilst under the influence of
blended liquors had fallen into a puddling-machine
at Bendigo, a lamentable accident which was only
made apparent some time later when bones, but-
tons, boots, and other distinguishing features
turned up in the sluice-boxes. Mr. Peters’ chum,
who had been accorded her mate’s surname and
sobriquet as a humble tribute to her superior man-
liness, was then thrown upon her own resourses—
and there she was at Monkey Bill’s bar.
Mr. Bender introduced the latest acquisition
to Jacker’s Flat to the assembled gentlemen as
“ Brummy Peters,” insinuating with some judi-
cious profanity that she was a splendid fellow, and
had vanquished a reputable pugilist in her time.
After which the lady took a hand at crib, and
succeeded in winning several pounds, and estab-
lishing her reputation as a good sort of a chap
before the night was spent.
Three months passed by, and J acker’s Flat still
maintained its not over-numerous population. The
yields, though good enough to keep its pioneers
hanging on, were not sufficiently exciting to at-
tract strangers from a distance, and if few had
departed less had arrived. Amongst the former was
the Honorable John, that gentleman “by G ”
having furled his tent by night and silently stolen
away, without taking the trouble of affording his
numerous creditors an opportunity of bidding him a
fond farewell. Brummy Peters, by which inelegant
appellation the Amazonian laundress became
generally known, was a frequent visitor at Monkey
Bill’s establishment, where she placidly puffed at
her meerschaum, dashed off an occasional brandy,
called down dire eternal penalties on the eyes,
parents, and progeny of the urbane host for
omitting stout from his stock-in-trade, and en-
gaged in various games of cards and Yankee-
grab, with so natural an air - of manly
bravado that her chosen associates at length
quite overcame the diffidence that the pre-
sence of a woman had occasioned, .aid de-
ported themselves with their accustomed easy
freedom, no longer pausing to select their oaths
with an eye to gentility or style, or being deterred
by gallantry from raising a row when all didn’t
seem fair, square, and above-board at the Card-
table. In fact, since Brummy acted as bottle-
holder for Treen, when he and Barney Ryan
settled their little difference in a fifteen-round mill
and displayed her signal ability to fulfil that
honourable and responsible office, the men
had quite disburdened their minds of the im-
pression that she was a woman, and ir w looked
upon her as one of themselves —a compliment for
which she was duly grateful. . Truly, Bender
was frequently chaffed about his intimacy with
Brummy, between him and whom there existed a
friendship, and accused of being amorously in-
clined towards that muscular lady, but the infer-
ences of these jokes were so preposterous, and the
jokers themselves were palpably so cognizant of
that absurdity, that Mr. Bender could receive the
chaff with as good grace, as if, for instance, he had
been facetiously accused of an intention of leading
his mate, Dick Treen, to the altar. Mrs. Peters
did not consort with the others of her sex on the
camp, but towards the unwholesome-locking
daughter of Mr. Stephen Bacon she displayed a
sort of fraternal interest, which moved her to tow
that lugubrious gentleman from the shanty to his
tent on divers occasions in a manner at once un-
ceremonious and emphatic.
The washerwoman had adorned J acker’s Flat
with her rather massive charms for the space of
about ten months, when one dark night, deterred
by the rain from making her usual visit to the
Pick and Barrow, as she sat on an inverted tub in
her cosy tent, her hands deep in her side pockets,
her back against the bunk, her feet
thrust out towards the fire that
raged up the small sod chimney, and
the inevitable meerschaum in her
lips—manly even in her solitude —
a light, quick step was heard with-
out, the flap of the tent was drawn
aside, and Cecilia Bacon, whiter,
more wretchedly woe-begone, and
desolate-looking a thousand times
than was her wont —and she was
white and woe-begone at her best-
staggered into the tent. Her head
was bare, and her thin flaxen hair,
sopping wet, clung to her face and
neck ; the rain dripped from the
poor skirt that was drawn up to
shield a tiny object feebly wailing at
her breast.
Mrs. Peters started up, her beloved
meerschaum, the object of a year’s
tender solicitude, fell, unheeded,
and was broken on the clay floor.
She caught the reelmg girl in her
arms, and laid her on the bunk,
tenderly took the babe from the wet
skirt, wrapped dry things of her
own about the feeble atom of
humanity, and laid it on a ’possum-
rug by the fire. After which she
turned her attention to the young
woman, and without a word pro-
ceeded to divest her of her soddened
garments and dry her reeking hair.
Brummy was a woman now with all
a good woman’s gentleness, compas-
sion, and quick perception. She
showed neither surprise nor curi-
osity, but proceeded quietly and
quickly with her work, and when
the girl, revived by the warmth
and the spirit that was forced be-
tween her lips, began to moan and
cry, she soothed her with pitiful
words in a soft, low voice that
proved how vain had been the long
years of wild, rough life and harsh
associations to embitter the soul
within.
Cecilia’s story was soon told.
The Honorable John was the father
of her child; he had deserted her
without a consideration, without a
word. After the birth, fearful
of meeting her father, she had left her tent,
intending to crawl to the creek, and drown
herself and her child; bnt when the black
waters lay at her feet she had not the courage
to take the leap, and, after wandering about the
bush in the wind and rain, distracted with misery
and fear, she sought the washerwoman’s tent.
“ Because,” she said, “you saved me from him
when you could.” And starting up she continued
wildly :
“He will kill me ! lam sure of it! My father
will kill me when he knows ! ”
“No, no!” murmured the woman, compas-
sionately ; “ don’t you fear, I will watch you.”
“ You do not know him,” hoarsely whispered
the young mother. “You do not know how ter-
rible he is at times. He has threatened me with
a pick over and over. He will do it now. Hadn’t
I far better have gone into the creek with my
baby ? My blood would not have been on my
father's head then, but on his —it’s father’s.
Father is drinking again, and he will kill me ! ”
“ Hush ! hush ! and rest now. If you can, go
back to your tent early -in the morning. Your
father is drinking, he will notice nothing—tell
him nothing. Leave your baby with me ; I will
care for it. Nobody will kill me/” And Mrs,
Peters squared her great shoulders, and thrust
her hands into her pockets with her old assump-
tion of manliness. “No one will kill me, I think !”
* * *
The gentlemen of Jacker’s Flat were astounded,
mystified, amazed, and virtuously indignant. It
was on the night following the incidents related
above, and Dick Treen had just entered Monk’s
bar with the intelligence that “ Brummy Peters
had got a kid !”
The shock conveyed by the news was general,
and confounded every man. They gazed open-
mouthed and dumb. A hurt and resentful
feeling succeeded. The gentlemen of Jacker’s
Flat had been imposed upon-their confidence


had been outraged. To think that Brummy
I eters, who had overawed them with her muscle
and manly assurance and hoodwinked them with
side-pockets and a billycock hat, was as frail as
the frailest of her sex—a weak, wayward woman
after all! It was a violation of all their finest
en iments. she threw me, Cumberland
and Durham style, best three out of five ! mur-
mured a brawny Geordie, in a bated whisper, only
now feeling the full force of his degradation.
Strangely enough all eyes focussed on Mr. Joseph
Bender, who blushed like a school-girl under the
concerted gaze, and toyed uneasily with his dis-
located nose
Gradually the look of consternation on the faces
of the gentlemen of .lacker’s Flat gave place to a
broad grin, which presently extended to a wild
guffaw, and thirty accusing fingers were pointed
at tlie now furious Bender.
urr i , ... ~, _ _
Here, look here, you fellers . he roared*
dashing his glass upon the floor and drawing his
sleeves ba;k from his great, knotted fist. “This
is too thunderin stiff, y know ! Ihe first man es
says 1 ve anythin t do with that youngster ’ll get
smashed! Now notice !”
Nobody spoke, but everybody laughed, and the
accusing fingers still pointed. Mr. Bender lin-
gered for a moment on the point of running amok
and wreaking his vengeance on all and sundry, but
thought better of it, pulled his hat over his eyes,
and strode out, his soul a prey to angry passions
and injured innocence.
Mrs. Peters fed the child by artificial means;
she procured a cunningly-designed bottle and
tubes, and went regularly to the station home-
stead at the foot of Mia-mia for milk. The diggers
regarded this conduct with an unfavourable eye ;
they supposed it to be another display of anti-
feminine sentiment, and nothing that Brummy
might do now could make them forget that she
was a woman—she had forfeited all her rights as
a man and a brother irretrievably. She visited
the shanty occasionally, and endeavoured t) main-
tain her old footing, but the men preserved a
studied coolness, and Curley Hunt even went so
far as to suggest that she be summarily ejected ;
but that perky little individual was brought to a
sudden repentance by being knocked over a bench
and thrown bodily through the calico window by
the ireful washerwoman.
Mrs. Peters appeared
to be very fond of the
child, but Bender was
frequently accused of dis-
playing a criminal lack
of parental affection.
Since the arrival of the
little stranger the de-
meanour of this gentle-
man had undergone a
painful change. He had
grown moody and fur-
tive; the banter of his
companions drove him
furious ; to be regarded
as the father of Brummy’s
child was bitter gall.
Given any other woman,
and he might have ac-
cepted the imputation
with some Complacency,
but Brummy Brummy
Peters, with her side-
pockets, ready fist, and
strong meerschaum —it
was too much. He deter-
mined to vindicate his
character and clear his
name of the tender im-
peachment at any cost.
With this object m view
he developed amateur
detective proclivities, and
kept a zealous eye on the
.lacker’s Flat laundry.
The baby was just a
month old when one night
the homely Mr. Bender
burst in upon the gentle-
men of Jacker’s Flat in
their usual retreat, which,
by the way, he had
avoided of late, his face
radiant and the ejacula-
tion of the ancient philo-
sopher on his lips.
“ Eureka ! I’ve struck
it, boys!” he cried,
triumphantly.
“What? The reef?”
exclaimed the men with
one voice—there having
been some prospecting for
a reef on the high ground.
“ Reef be d d ! No ;
proofs that you fellers’re
a lot of blamed asses as ’ve been barkin’ up th
wrong tree !” The representation of a lot of asses
barking up a tree was certainly not a strikingly
felicitous illustration, but Mr. Bender was too
excited to be precise in small matters. He con-
tinued : . , ,
“ See here, with all yer infernal jaw an cheek
that kid ain’t Brummy’s, after all.”
“ Not Brummy’s ?”—and great excitement.
“No ’taint. ' It’s ” here Bender lowered
his voice and jerked his thumb towards the dark
corner. “ It’s his daughter’s.”
But, despite Bender’s circumspection, Mr.
Bacon had heard, and he advanced into the light,
the big tears stealing down his cheeks and his
favourite look of unutterable woe overspreading
his bloated face. . ,
“Whose child did you say, Mr. Bender, sir?
he queried in tones of deep bathos. .
“Nobody’s! Go to blazes, snufflebuster! I his
ain’t no business of yours !” .
Stephen Bacon retired again to his shades to
indulge his lachrymose propensities and sorrow
over his grog, and Bender related in a low
voice how, by keeping an eye on Brummy’s estab-
lishment and noting Joe’s frequent visits, and
putting this and that together, he had arrived at
the conclusion that was to prove him innocent of
the delicate peccadillo insinuated against him,
Mr. Bacon’s settled sorrow was very distressing
that night, and he was subsequently ejected
amidst a shower of tears, dolefully calling upon his
late lamented wife to come back and comfort his
declining years; but that, lady, doubtless retain-
ing a lively remembrance of the weight of his fist
and the force of his foot, failed to respond.
Next morning being Sunday, an off-day, quite
a number of the gentlemen of J acker’s Flat, who
were indulging in a game of quoits, and others
who were sunning themselves and smoking on the
grass, indolent and uninterested spectators, down
by the creek, were disturbed by sounds of a row
at the tent of their laundress, Mrs. Peters, and
as the public interest of the Flat centred for the
time in that domicile, the gentlemen who were
sunning themselves leisurely upended, the con-
testants dropped their quoits, and all strolled
across to the tent* Mrs. Peters was standing
with her back to the entrance, her lips were
tightly compressed, and there was an awed, sor-
rowful expression in her face that the men had
never seen there before. She held the baby in her
arms in quite a matronly fashion and calmly faced
Mr. Stephen Bacon, who was bordering on so-
briety and whose settled sorrow was subordinated
for the time to unreasoning rage,
“You’ve got my girl here!” he yelled, grace-
fully turning the sentence with several euphonious
curses and brandishing the pick-handle he held in
b is hand.

“Well, I want her. D—n you ! I want her.
I’ve ’eard your little game. It’s all up ! She got
away from me last night, but I’ll have her now ! ”
further away than you think, Steve
Ba ? 0 "’ but you can have her. ”. .
.J™ d ™ * T ant seemo girl with that m yer
sald homier who had come up with the
others, snatching the rnck-handle from his grasp.
<< And yer want t’ be carm, y’ know, ’cause if yer
hurt yer girl when I’m near, I’ll spread y’ out
quick.”
“ jj e can ’t hurt her,” added Brummy. “ Come
i n . Don’t go away, boys, she’d like t’ see y’ all.
Jest come lip and look m.”
The men who had turned away, thinking the
girl would feel her shame doubly keen if upbraided
in their presence, startled by the tone in which
the request was made, went back. Brummy held
the flap of the tent aside, and they all looked in.
“ Great God ! Dead ? ”
Yes, the pale, slight, awkward girl, scarcely
paler in death, her large, light-blue eyes fixed
with the frightened expression that had charac-
terised them in life, lay dead upon Brummy’s
bunk, and from the spare flaxen hair, and the long
thin hand, and the points of her clothing, hang-
ing over the side, pools of water had dripped to
the floor.
“Yes, she’s dead ! ” said Mrs. Peters, the tears
on her lashes belying her harsh tones. “Drowned!
I found her body in the shallow water near the
bank when I went to the dam this morning. This
is your work, Joe Bender.”
“No ! No ! For Christ’s sake don’t say that !!”
“You told her story at Monkey Bill’s last night
—he heard you. That snivelling cur was a devil
to her. She said he would kill her if he ever
knew—he intended to last night, but she got away
and took the job off his hands.”
“Come in. Don’t go away, boys, she’d like t’ see y’ all. Jest come up and look in.”
Steve Bacon, shocked by the unexpected sight,
had fallen into a crouching position in a corner.
He straightened himself now.
“And her child? ” he muttered, pointing towards
the dead girl.
“He is mine. She gave him to me, and I will
keep him. ” And the muscular arms of the washer-
woman folded the tiny mite closer to her breast.
On the Monday evening following, Brummy
Peters was waited on by a deputation from the
gentlemen of Jacker’s Flat. A very respectful
deputation it was, and wished to “signerfy that the
fellers all voted her a brick, an’ hoped how she’d
pocket that trifle to help her with th’ youngster,
an’ say nothin’.” That trifle was a roll of notes of
all sorts and sizes surrounding a five ounce nugget,
the biggest ever found on Jacker’s Flat, and the
contribution of the Geordie. Mrs. Peters, in re-
sponding, accepted the gift, and said she knew
the boys was real grit, and promised to make a
man of the little chap on her bosom if she could.
And right loyally she fulfilled her promise ; it
would astonish you if you only knew who is the
foster-son of the washerwoman of .lacker’s Flat.

Tim Bennett: A Warlike Reminiscence.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Know Tim Bennett 1 Guess I do ; but,
for the matter of that, who doesn’t ? He’s up in
Queensland now, managing some big company or
other.
No ! He’s not such a crank on volunteering as
he used to be in the good old New Zealand times.
# * *
My reminiscence is not about Tim s com
mand of the Wellington corps at Parihaka. Mine
goes back nearly 20 years, right to the beginning of
the seventies. Tim was a fluffy-faced, blue-eyed
lad of 19 then, and as proud as a K.C.M.G.
of his lieutenant’s commission in the Thames
Naval Brigade. Fine corps it was, too. One
hundred and fifty strong, brass band, big pinnace,
lots of old salts in the ranks and a high standard
of discipline. Well, on one occasion there was a
big review at Auckland, and it fell to Tim s lot to
sail the fully-equipped pinnace. Away she went
with her big white lug shimmering like a snow-
drift in the sun, her band playing “Sicilian
Mariners” and “Close the Shutters, Willies
Dead,’’with Tim, gold-laced to the eyes, and proud
as a Viking in the sternsheets.
# *
H.M.S. Blanche lay lazily at anchor in the
opaline sea that laves the fair city of Auckland.
The pinnace Hawk, one gun, Lieut. Bennett, ap-
proached the mighty warship with a wet sheet,
and Tim, crammed with every intricacy of naval
etiquette, dipped his dandy little ensign. A
sleepy-looking marine, doing sentry at the gang-
way, grinned broadly to himself, but made no
attempt to bring about a reciprocation of this cus-
tomary maritime courtesy.
Tim’s fluffy little moustache billowed slightly—
it was too downy to bristle then—and he sharply
dipped his flag again. Still no response.
“ Beat to quarters !” shrieked Tim, putting his
helm down hard and shaking his craft into the
wind, bow to bow with the warship.
“ Rat-tat-tat-tattly-tattly-tat ” went the two
kettle-drums, and the men stumbled into their
places, port and starboard.
Tim’s next order was a paralyser. It came out
clear and sharp, with heart-stirring determination.
“ Two-pound-ah, bow-chase-ah! with round
shot, LOAD 1”
[lam aware that this all sounds like a hunk out
of “Bold Bob, the Boy Buccaneer of the Barba-
does,” but it’s as true as gospel, for I helped to
serve that gun.]
“ What the h are you going to do with that
pop-gun?” yelled an elderly boatswain from the
fo’c’s’le of the Blanche, as Gunner Parslow was
sighting a pot-shot at the big warship’s figure-
head.
“Keep cool, Parslow! Take steady aim,” said
the fearless Bennett, as he stood with his un-
sheathed blade resting on a thwart. All these
incidents that have taken so long to describe
occurred, of course, in a few seconds. The beating
to quarters had hurried the just-terminating
officers’ mess on deck. A few words with the
stupefied sentry showed the Captain how matters
stood, and before Tim had fired his gun the
Blanche’s flag fluttered gracefully deckward. This
mollified Tim and altered his belligerent inten-
tions, and when he was invited to come alongside
and explain matters he did so with alacrity. He
stuttered a bit when he gave his views of the
duty of one warship to another, but the last rem-
nants of bad feeling were washed out in cham-
pagne.
For years after it was a standing joke on the
Australasian station about the little volunteer
officer who gave one of Her Majesty’s ships a
lesson in na v al etiquette.

A Cup Comedy.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
Persons of the Drama : Arabella, De Vermifuge,
Tall Gentleman, with hollow eyes.
Scene; The Lawn.
De Vermifuge (glanoir compassionately
around, says to himself) : “Not so bad —not so
bad, pon honnah —for these half-bwed Austwa-
lians. Poor fellows ! If they could only see the
Oaks —or the Dahby ! Man is no bettah
than a dem vegetable who has not seen the
Dahby. (Starts suddenly). The Davil! Shoahly
my eyes deceive me ! (Sticks his eyeglass in his
eye and advances cautiously in the direction of a
lady in a heliotrope dress). It is—it is her figgah !
That gwaeeful pose—that poise of head upon such
perfect shoulders—what is it the poet-fellow says :
‘ Like a bell-flowah on its bed.’
(Those poet-fellows wear shocking bad clothes,
but they can put things pretty neatly sometimes.)
They could belong to none but Awabella. Ah,
Awabella, why did I desert thee ? The paw girl
has followed me out to Austwalia ovah the wolling
waves—the beastly ocean. She looks awound. I
will appwoach her. (Goes forward and raising
his hat says). Aw, Miss Fitzjuggins—is —is it
possible or but a bewtchus dweam too fair to last ?”
Arabella (shaking hands with him): “No,
Mr. De Vewmifuge, it is weal. But who would
have dweamt of seeing you heah? You quite
took my bweath away. When did you awive ? ”
De Vermifuge : “Aw! about a month ago.
And you ?”
Arabella : “ By last steamah.”
De Vermifuge : “ Beastly place, isn’t it ? ”
Arabella : “ Beastly ! ”
De Vermifuge : “The people, too !”
Arabella: “Oh ,dweadful! They don’t seem
to appweciate in the least the honnah we do them
in visiting them.”
De Vermifuge : “ Paw things ! But what can
you expect ? ”
Arabella: “Twoo! They have no oppah-
tunities of culohaw. Would you cwedit it— they
hardly undahstand me when I speak? ”
De Vermifuge (with disgust): “Bahbahians !”
A pause, during which De Vermifuge gazes ten-
derly at Arabella, and she glances nervously in the
direction of a tall, tawny-eomplexioned gentleman
with hollow eyes, who is watching the race through
a field-glass.
De Vermifuge ; “Awabella!”
Arabella ; “Yes, Mr. De Vewmifuge.”
De Vermifuge (reproachfully); “ Mistah De
Vewmifuge ! Ah, why so cold and fawmal ? Why
not Wupert? Have you so soon fagotten old
times —the deah old times when ?”
Arabella (hurriedly): “ No, Mr. Vewmifuge;
but ”
De Vermifuge: “And the vows we plighted
undah the—the—what-do-you-call-it?—the gewa-
nium in the consewatwoy at Mountjones’s ball.
Oh ! Awabella, tell me that you are still twoo !”
Arabella (with dignity) : “ Yoah wemem-
bwance does not seem to have been too good,
either, Mr. De Vewmifuge.”
De Vermifuge (stifling a sigh which sounds
suspiciously like a hiccough) ; “Ah, you do not
know me yet, Awabella. (Changing his tone sud-
denly) But where is your mothah ? and that sweet
little sistah of your’s—deah, ahtless little thing—
who used to fill my hat with watah ? {sotto voce—
wetched little bwat). What pleshah I shall have
in taking you about and showing you evewything
there is to be seen in this pweoious hole! You
know I have been heah neahly foah weeks, and I
know all about it. Tell you a secwet (dropping
his voice to a whisper), I think of witing a book
about it, like those othah fellows. What do you
say to a dwive to Doncastah to-mowow?”
Arabella (glancing still more nervously at th e
tall, tawny gentleman who has shut up his glass
and is slowly lounging over towards them): “I
I am afwaid not.”
De Vermifuge (insistently and with growing
passion in his voice): “Oh, but you know you
must! You weally must. I must speak to you
once again. I ”
Arabella (with agitation): “ Oh, please say no
moah. I ”
De Vermifuge (ignoring the interruption) :
“We will wenew our vows and you will tell me
you will be mine and I shall bwing you away from
this beastly countwy, my own lovely Awabella—
my blushing bwide—to deah old England and
Wotten Wow—and —what is the mattah, my
love ?”
Turning around he sees the tall, tawny gentle,
man standing within a few feet of them and
gazing at them with a curious look in his hollow
eyes.
De Vermifuge (sotto voce); “ Heah is that eon)
founded Queensland Squattah I have the wagah
with. I wondah if he is good enough fawm to in-
troduce to her ? But I suppose I must. (Aloud).
Aw, Stanley, how are you, deah boy? (Turn-
ing to Arabella) Permit me, Miss Fitzjuggins,
to intwoduce to you a fwiend of mine, Mr. Stanley,
of Queensland.”
Mr. Stanley bows coldly and says “You have
given me an unexpected pleasure, Mr. De Vermi-
fuge.”
Arabella changes from white to crimson, and
from crimson to white again; then, taking the
arm of the tall, tawny gentleman, and laughing
nervously, says: “Mr. Do Vermifuge, allow mo
to present to you my husband.”

The Tiredest Man.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
The tiredest man Australia ever knew is
dead. His name was Gideon Smith. He died
in comparative oblivion at the early age of 52 years
and four months ; he claimed relationship with
Governor Carington, a contention amply sup-
ported by the intense vividness of his yawn. Re-
cognising that chronic weariness was their son’s
strongest characteristic, his parents secured him a
position in the police force at an early age, and
for 20 odd years he fluttered feebly about his beat,
dragging his feet after him with a painful effort,
lurking in the shadows hooked to convenient pro-
jections, sleeping in unfrequented places, leaning
hopelessly in out-of-the-way corners, and hanging
dejectedly over railings and horse-troughs, grow-
ing more and more fatigued as the years rolled on.
Then they wanted to make him a sergeant, and he
collapsed. He did not throw up his billet, for
that would have required too great an effort —he
simply rolled out of the force, and lay in a state of
coma for three days, and then awoke and feebly
expostulated. He said he could not carry another

was confined to his bed for nine solid weeks.

During Constable Smith’s long service in
the force he never arrested a man unless the cul-
prit wanted him to, and then he would hang
heavily on to his prisoner, shut his eyes, and
leave matters entirely to the good sense of the
malefactor. One night, in a moment of un-
paralleled enthusiasm, he took charge of a mild
little inebriate who had no particular objec-
tions to advance, and who valiantly towed
his captor to within a hundred yards of the lock-
up be'ore coming to the conclusion that he was
exceeding his functions as a common drunk and
incapable, and then he subsided, and flopped
down on the footpath, leaving the tired and

his hands. Gideon expostulated in wearj ,
mournful cadences, pointed out the unreasoning
aggravation of such a proceeding, and called
upon his prisoner in the Queen’s name to exert
himself; but the inebriate merely muttered some
treasonable ejaculations, and relapsed into uncon'
■ciousness.
* * *
Constable Smith was hurt and indig-
nant —he calculated the distance to the lock-up,
took a mental estimate of the tonnage of his
prisoner, gave a feeble haul at his collar, again
surveyed the track to the haven, of drunks, fluctu-
ated for a moment, and finally groaned in spirit and
sat down on the prostrate citizen, pending his better
judgment. When the bibulous offender awoke he
found himself weighed down by a great mass of
somnolent policeman, but he contrived to crawl
from under, and departed, leaving the arresting
constable slumbering as peacefully as a little child.
Gideon, too, was subject to fits of absence of mind
consequent upon his excessive faintness and the
extreme difficulty fat men experience in recalling
circumstances, especially in so warm a climate ; he
ouuld not think two thought* consecutively with-
out being thrown into a profuse perspiration, and
the effort necessary to sustain a state of mental
alertness always winded him in a few seconds.
Towards 12 o’clock one night, near the termina-
tion of his police experience, he encountered a

wounded woman who was lying in a state of un-
consciousness up a right-of-way. He felt that the
woman was wanting in consideration in thus
foisting her troubles on a fatigued and dispirited
man; but, knowing his duty as an officer of the
law, he sent a boy who happened to be passing
away for a cab, and then propped his exhausted
nature up against a house, and enjoyed a short
respite in sweet forgetfulness. When the cab
arrived he scrambled wearily into the vehicle,
directed the Jehu to drive to the hospital, and sub.
sided again into a condition of profound lethargy.
When awakened at the hospital he summoned up
all his energies—and found he had forgotten the
woman!
* * *
After withdrawing from the force, Gideon
Smith took a long rest to recruit and bolster up
his shattered figure. He weighed about sixteen
stone at this stage of his mild career, and had to
shore up his frame against a brick house or a stone
mill—he could no longer trust to fences and such
feeble structures. He secured a position on a
stool in the Lands Department, but left before the
end of his first week because his rest was disturbed
by the chief clerk, who would insist on his lick-
ing the stamps. Then he accepted a billet as
night-watchman at a furniture warehouse, but
abandoned it on finding that his sleep was broken
at 8 o’clock every morning by the advent of the
employes. He next placed himself at a small
remuneration to advertise a cheap restaurant.
The proprietor, however, refused to provide a boy
to dust the flies off him, and he languidly with-
drew. Occasionally it had occurred to Mr. Smith
that the life of a shepherd was one singularly
adapted to a man of his
taste and weight—the
duties were not onerous ;
it was work a fellow
could lie down to, and,
with the assistance of a
dog to bark for him, the
functions could be per-
formed in sleep. Gideon
wished to be a shepherd,
and by degrees communi-
cated his desire to an in-
fluential friend, who ob-
tained for him a situation
on the staff of a large
pastoralist holding land
in Rodney (Vic.), and
in due time ex-constable
Smith was installed as a
tender of sheep in a lone
hut in the valley of the
Goulbum.
* * *
For four months
Gideon Smith continued
to mind his flock, and
during that time he main-
tained his characteristic weariness and grew
several degrees fatter ; and there he would have
remained to this day had not external influences
conspired to remove him, as he had become too
tired to change his mind. Nearly the whole of
his pastoral career he passed on the flat of his ex-
tensive back in the shade of a friendly wattle
only assuming the perpendicular under pressure,
for the exertion of throwing a shadow was too
severe a strain upon his exhausted energies and
tended to crack his faculties and fill his being
with unspeakable weariness. One Sunday morning,

however, after a few days’ hard rain, Gideon was
grievously awakened from his deep sleep by a pile-
getter, who stopped in passing to shake up the
prostrate shepherd and inform him that the
fiats were flooded and he’d bettor get up and
strand himself on a greater eminence if he’d
no desire to be put to the inconvenience of being
found drowned, and inquired into by the coroner.
Mr. Smith grunted a vague remonstran. e,
wearily rolled over his cumbersome personality
in the bunk, and, seeing only about two inches of
water on the floor of the hut, moaned a pathetic
and profane complaint about being harassed and
worried to a shadow by officious idiots who
wouldn’t let him get his natural rest. He further-
more remarked, in a ghostly whisper with a
fading inflection that there were stacks of time,
surged over again, and snored like a reed instru-
ment.
* * *
An hour later a conscientious settler,
diverging from the submerged road, paddled up
to the isolated hut, and clamoured violently in the
ears of its fatigued occupant. Gideon opened one eye
slightly, and groaned despondingly—he saw there
was no rest for the weary in this wicked world.
“ Can’t you let a feller alone ? ” he feebly moaned
with touching pathos. “Can’t you see I’m
tired ? ” The settler directed his attention to the
sloppy state of his surroundings, and reminded
him that the fountains of heaven were opened and
the waters of the great deep broken up. Gideon
Smith slowly yawned and said he didn’t care a
curse—he was sleepy. He put a theological im-
precation upon the settler’s eyes, and pleaded
pitifully to be allowed to have a wink of
THE GENTLE SHEPHERD.
sleep. At eight o’clock a rescue party, passing
in a boat, gave him a call ; they said they
were going down to ferry Muldoon’s family off
the Point, and earnestly advised Mr. Smith to
arise and wade for the high ground, if he didn’t
want to be waterlogged in the flower of his man-
hood. Gideon again yawned, lifted his head,
gazed with an eye of sad reproach at the rising
waters, now within an inch of his wayworn person,
summoned all his faculties to an intense apprecia-
tion of the comforts of his bunk, then sighed
heavily, and sank back on his pillow. “ It’s all

right, chaps,” he murmured, drowsily, “I'll come
off when I’ve had a rest.” Then a happy after-
thought struck him, and he remarked, with a little
more vigour, “ P’raps you chaps’d jest step in an’
hist my bunk up a foot or two, if yer not in much
of a hurry.” Our hero was dimly conscious of
being directed to a pit of fire and brimstone, as he
fell again to rest.
* * *
Ex-policeman Smith was disturbed again
in an hour or so by the cool flood laving
his feet, and rippling insidiously along his
spine. He turned once more, and his soul was
full of gall—Man and Nature seemed to conspire
to rob him of brief respite from awful langour and
bodily fatigue. He pondered a while :if he got
up he would have to scramble nearly half a hun-
dred yards to dry land ; wouldn’t it be better to
wait a while, and see if the flood were not about
to subside ? Perhaps if he could woo sleep to his
tired eyes again, he might not feel so entirely
prostrated when he awoke; anyhow, it was
awfully wearing on the system to get up suddenly
like this. Many a time he had thought how tire-
some it was to have to breathe, to be forced to
keep on working like a machine, drawing in and
blowing out air from night till morning, and from
morning till night. Gideon gazed dejectedly into
the yellow waters, lifted himself on his elbow,
made a mental calculation of the laborious diffi-
culties of reaching solid earth, pondered on his
physical weariness with intense grief, wished some-
body would come along with a cart with nice soft
springs and transport him bodily at so much for the
job, propped himself a little higher, and was on the
point of making a superhuman effort when he dis-
covered that his feet were tangled in the chaff-
sack mattress. Then he sighed and spread him-
self on the bunk once more—that was justification
enough. He gave it best. He just crowded on to
the dry side of his bunk, drew up his knees, and
slumbered.
* * *
Towards evening on that wet Sunday a
number of labourers from a vineyard discovered a
hut sailing gaily on the face ot the flood ; in it
they found a body floating amongst hand-made
furniture and other wreckage. Gideon Smith was
at rest.

The Worked-out Mine.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
On summer nights when moonbeams pour
And glisten o’er the high, white tips,
And soft winds make a woeful roar
Like gales through ribs of shattered ships,
And steal about the broken brace
Where pendant timbers swing and mr an,
And flitting bats give aimless chase,
Who dares to seek the mine alone ?
The shrinking bush in sable rims
A skeleton forlorn and bowed,
With pipe-clay white about its limbs
And at its feet—a tattered shroud ;
And ghostly figures lurk and groan,
Shrill whispers sound from ghostly lips,
And ghostly footsteps start the stone
That clatters sharply down the tips.
The engine-house now darkly looms,
The life that raged within has fled ;
The boilers grimly gape, like tombs,
Once fierce with fire and glowing red;
Above the shaft, in measured space,
A rotted rope swings to and fro,
Whilst o’er the plat and on the brace
The silent shadows come and go.
And there below, in chambers dread
Where darkness like a fungus clings,
Are lingering still the old mine’s dead —
• Bend o’er and hear their whisperings !
Up from the blackness sobs and sighs
Are flung with moans and muttered fears,
A low lament that never dies,
And ceaseless sounds of falling tears.
My ears intent have heard their grief—
The fitful tones of Carter’s tongue,
The strong man crushed beneath the reef,
The groans of Pan ton, Praer and Young,
And “ Trucker Bill ” of Number 5,
In faint, far murmurs weirdly troll ;
For deep in every shoot and drive
This mine secretes a shackled soul.
Ah ! woeful mine, where wives have wept,
And mothers prayed in anxious pain,
And long, distracting vigil kept,
You yawn for victims now in vain !
Still to that god, whose shrine you were,
Is homage done in wild device ;
Men hate you as the sepulchre
That stores their bloody sacrifice.

Pot and Spoon.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“ The World’s great pot stands smoking before me, but
lias, I have no spoon to help myself.” —Urine.
The earth is decked all o’er with flowers,
It teems with grain and fruits,
With bird and beast and fish and plant,
With berried vines and roots ;
Dame Nature’s pot is smoking hot
At mom, eve, midnight, noon,
Where some may dip, while some may not
Because they have no spoon.
’Tis free for all, this sav’ry mess,
The birthright of mankind,
Then why should one go dinnerless ?
’Twas never thus designed.
For aye the pot is full, God wot!
If some poor, helpless coons
Don’t fairly share the common lot,
’Tis that they have no spoons.
Can it be fair that some should sup
From ladles deeply dipped,
While others lick the driblets up
That from their beards have dripped ?
Shall he who bears Earth’s heavy loads
Alone be grudged this boon —
Doomed aye to wait till drones are served
Then forced to hire a spoon ?
Shall he who never sowed, nor reaped,
Fetched water, nor hewed wood.
Who neither ploughed, nor tilled, nor heaped,
Usurp each earthly good ?
Though Nature’s pot is smoking-hot,
Why should some thievish loons
Claim jurisdiction o’er the lot,
Because they stole the spoons ?
Why should the few sit idly down
While many starve and sweat ?
Why should one wear a jewelled crown
While some ’neath briars fret ?
Why should one play the live-long day,
Another dirges croon,
One live to curse his appetite,
One wield a silver spoon ?
Earth’s bounteous banquet’s spread for all,
The mightiest and the least,
Though spacious is the dining-hall
Few’re bidden to the feast;
But some have sworn, with ardour hot,
To struggle—may’t come soon—
Till every son of man has got
A Welcome and a Spoon.

A Myall Friendship.
Dear Bulletin,—lf there is one thing
that I can admire in a man it is a capacity for a
tfreat friendship. I have just found one—in the
wrinkled bosom of a blackfellow, a myall.
* * *
Jimmy the Myall and Blucher, two black-
fellows of the Leichhardt district, Rockhampton,
Queensland, were friends. They slept together
under the same sheet of bark. Together they
hunted the rapid iguana, and pursued the hurried
opossum, and sooled the picturesque native-bear
in his leafy home. But, alas ! Jimmy the Myall,
who was some years older than Blucher, one day
found his strength and spirits unmistakeably fail-
ing him ; and what he took to be his summons to
the hunting-grounds standing up on end almost
directly in front of him. What was to be done ?
Overhead an eaglehawk was disporting itself in
the noontide sun. In front of them, not 20 feet
away, a kangaroo-rat was taking their measure,
with something like contempt half hidden in the
light of its cunning little eye. But both Jimmy
and Blucher were miles below contemplat-
ing the heavens at any time, and the kan-
garoo-rat was as void of affording the discovery
of the elixir of life as an infant is of the use of
injudicious advertising ; or a monkey up a stick of
the clue to perpetual motion. It was at this
supreme moment, when the soul of Blucher went
out in undying pity and friendship towards his
old chum, and while a hush, as of the hush of a
dead universe, was on all around, that the light
of inspiration suddenly broke in upon his sceptical
mind. Why should Jimmy suffer ? Why should
Blucher let Jimmy suffer ? Better, far better for
both of them, that since they could not be to.
gether, they should be divided. Better, far better
that Jimmy should be put out of pain ; and since
he was not permitted to hang on any longer to life
in this world, with decency and decorum, he
should be despatched to the next, to take a fresh
lease of life there. Besides, if he lived, what could
he hope to be but a wreck, a burden on Blucher ?
No !No ! ! Would Blucher like Jimmy to be a
burden on him ? Not exactly. What was their
friendship worth if either of these alternatives
were to be its consummation ?
* * *
The grave mind of Blucher was made up.
J immy must die. Having come to this happy con-
clusion, Blucher, overflowing with the milk of
human kindness, hastened to put his project into
immediate execution. A grave was made, and
almost before Jimmy was aware of the fond axid
delicate intentions of his friend he was being de-
posited in his last resting-place. At this point,
however, the first difference arose which had ever
existed between them. Jimmy objected to the
expulsion of his identity from this world, and
finding remonstrances unavailing, there and then
spent his little remaining strength in physically
contesting Blucher’s right to take his dissolution
into his own hands. In vain Blucher extolled the
wisdom of dying to live no more, as against the
unwisdom of living to die again. Jimmy couldn’t
see it. But, as I have said, Blucher’s mind was
quite made up; and, finding force was necessary, he
exerted himself to persuade his mate into acquies-
cence by sundry physical arguments, with the
result that he cut the ground from Jimmy’s feet,
as it were, and very soon commenced affectionately
distributing it over his collapsed length as it lay
in its narrow bed, apparently resigned to the in-
evitable. Already to Blucher’s eye, tear-suffused
with the memory of a friendship too sweet to
last, the grass was already growing in luxurious
dalliance over the grave, when lo ! a young earth-
quake seemed to be upending itself under his feet,
and presently a black form, almost white with
fright and with an excitement of haste account-
able only on the supposition that it must have had
a moment’s glimpse of Sheol, and that that
glimpse was simply h —ll, burst through the heap
of rubbish which had been piled upon it with a
strength which seemed to be more than myall.
Jimmy would not die (could not die, in fact);
and Blucher, in sheer desperation, gave up the
argument.
* * *
Some few hours after the enactment of
this little comedy in myall life, I reached .
Station, from no matter where. Here I found
Blucher, who greeted me with the words, “ Jimmy
close up dead longa scrub. I been put him longa
hole. Close up cubber im up. That pfeller been
get out then. You come help em me. You hold
im longa hole, me cubber im up again?” On
my declining to comply with his request he
seemed considerably astonished and hurt, and
I saw that in his opinion my everyday humanity
was not up to the myall standard by a long chalk.
It did not, however, prevent him from asking me
for some tobacco. The following day the two
passed the station in each other’s company, when
Blucher again asked me for some tobacco. On
learning that this was the price Jimmy demanded
from Blucher for the resumption of the old friend-
ship, I supplied the want. And from that day to
this I have been in great doubt which to admire
most, viz., the comprehensiveness of Blucher’s
affection for Jimmy, or Jimmy’s appreciation of it,
as demonstrated by its only requiring a piece of
tobacco to efface its asperities from his recollec-
tion.—

THE SLEEPING
BEAUTY.
A Yarn of
Lambing
Flat
i ALL that a yarn ! ” said old Tom Hugh,
“ What rot ! I’ll lay my h t
I’ll sling a yarn worth more nor two
Such pumped-up yarns as that,”
And thereupon old Tommy “ slew ”
A yarn of Lambing Flat.
“ When Lambing Flat broke out,” he said,
“ ’Mongst others there I knew
A lanky, orkard, Lunnon-bred
Young chap named Johnny Drew,
And nicknamed for his love of bed,
The ‘ Sleeping Beauty ’ too.
“ He sunk a duffer on the Flat
In comp’ny with three more,
And makin’ room for this and that
They was a tidy four,
Save when the eldest, ‘ Dublin Pat, ”
Got drunk and raved for gore.
“ This Jack at yarnin’ licked a book,
And half the night he’d spout,
But when he once turned in, it took
Old Nick to get him out.
And that is how they came to cook
The joke I tell about.
“ A duffer-rush broke out one day,
I quite forget where at —
(It doesn’t matter, anyway,
It didn’t feed a cat) —
And Johnnie’s party said they’d say
‘ Good-bye ’ to Lambing Fiat.
“ Next morn rose Johnnie’s mates to pack
And make an early shunt,
But all they could get out of Jack
Was ‘ All right, ’or a grunt,
By pourin’ water down his back
And—when he turned—his front.
“ The billy biled, the tea was made,
They sat and ate their fill,
But Jack, up m his broad back laid,
Sn >red like a fog-horn still ;
‘ We’ll save some tea to scald him,’ said
The peaceful ‘ Oorney Bill.’
“ As they their beef and damper ate
And swilled their pints of tea.
A bully notion all at wonst
Dawned on that rowdy three.
And ‘ Dublin Pat,’ in frantic mirth,
Said, ‘ Now we’ll have a spree !’
“ Well, arter that, I’m safe to swear,
The beggars didn’t lag.
But packed their togs with haste and care,
And each one made his swag
With Johnnie’s ‘moleskins,’ ev'ry pair.
Included in kh» h>m
“ With nimble fingers from the pegs
They soon the strings unbent,
And off its frame as sure as eggs
They drew the blessed tent,
And rolled it up and stretched their legs,
And packed the lot —and went.
“ And, scarcely p’raps a thing to love,
The ‘ Beauty ’ slumbered sound,
With nought but Heaven’s blue above
And Lambing Flat around,
Until in sight some diggers hove—
Some diggers out’ard bound.
“ They sez as twelve o’clock was nigh—
We’ll say for sure elev’n—
When Johnnie ope’d his right-hand eye
And looked straight up to Heav’n :
I i eckon he got more surprise
Than struck the fabled Sev’n.
“ Clean off his bunk he made a bound,
And when he rubbed his eyes
I’m safe to swear poor Johnnie found
His dander ’gin to rise.
For there were diggers standin’ round—
Their missuses likewise.
“ Oh, Lor’! the joke—it warn’t lost,
Though it did well-nigh tear
The sides of them as came acrost
The flat to hear J ack swear.
They sez as how old Grimshaw toss’d
His grey wig in the air.
“ Some minutes on the ground Jack lay,
And bore their screamin’ jeers,
And every bloke that passed that way
Contributed his sneers ;
Jack groaned aloud, that cursed day
Seemed lengthened into years.
“ Then in a fury up he sprung—
A pretty sight, you bet—
And laid about him with his tongue
Advising us to ‘get,’
And praying we might all be hung—
I think I hear him yet.
“ Then, on a sudden, down he bent,
And grabbed a chunk of rock,
And into Grimshaw’s stomach sent
The fossil, with a shock,
And Grimshaw doubled up and went
To pieces with the knock.
“ And in the sun that day Jack stood
Clad only in his shirt,
And fired with stones and bits of wood,
And with his tongue threw dirt;
He fought as long as e’er he could—
But very few were hurt.
“ He stooped to tear a lump
of schist
Out of the clinging soil,
By thunder you should heard
him jist,
And seen the way he’d coil
Upon the ground, and hug his
fist,
And scratch and dig and toil !
“ ’Twas very plain he’d struck it fat,
The dufferin’ Lunnon muff;
The scoff and butt of Lambing Flat
Who always got it rough,
Could strike his fortune where he sat;
The joker held the stuff.
“ Well, that’s the yarn, it ain’t so poor ;
Them golden days is o’er,
And Dublin Pat was drowned, and sure
It quenched his thirst for gore ;
Old ‘ Cockney Bill ’ and ‘ D.ve the Cure ’
I never heard on more. -
“ The ‘Sleepin’ Beauty’s ’ wealthy, too,
And wears a shiny hat,
But often comes to old Tom Pugh
To have a quiet chat;
I lent him pants to get him through
His fix on Lambing Flat. ”
THE MAGEE'S COLLECTION.
Some years ago a fiery Methodist clergy-
man used to hold forth in a little gospel-hall at
Alfredton, a single-barrelled hamlet near Ballarat.
One Sabbath morning just as he had got fairly
grafted on a text, and was pounding Scripture
1 ke fifty head of stampers, a long, lean aboriginal
hung his great, angular cranium in at the door-
way, and surveyed the room. After satisfying
himself that it was not a pub., he turned to quit,
but changing his mind, he tossed the slack of his
blanket over his shoulder, and stalked up the
a'sle with the dominant bearing of a Roman
smator. He was followed by a skinny, old
spavined gin, who was industriously munching a
q lid as big as a fist. She bore a Consumptive,
mwashed piccaninny upon her back, and wore an
old, blue horse-rug, trimmed with holes and
'possum gravy. The lordly nigger took a seat in
a i unoccupied pew, his gin camping directly be-
hind him, and there they sat, shedding an aroma
o’ old rum and aboriginal, manifesting little
concern although the worshippers gaped
and giggled as if they (the nigs.) were a
minstrel-show till a dear brother paddled
r iund with a tray, to take up the offer-
ings of the faithful. The congregation responded
freely, and as the silver trickled in the unkempt
savage brightened visibly, Presently the deacon
came to where he sat, and being a facetious old
pot-head, presented the dish to King Billy. A
gleam of joyous surprise illumined the monarch’s
face, and he eagerly clutched the plate out of the
g >od man’s hands, and drained its contents into
the folds of his toga, and whilst people, parson,
and deacon gazed in amaze, he rose from where he
sat, returned thanks quaintly: “Budgery you!
Good, good !” beckoned to his gin, and stalked out
as solemnly as he had entered. The dear brother
soon recovered the shock, and pranced out to
recover the lucre—in time to see the guileless inno-
cmts trip into a local hostel. He went and
wrangled with the original possessor of the soil,
and earned an evil reputation through creating a
disturbance upon licensed premises on the day of
rest, but he never saw that collection any more ;
in orty hours by a fast clock it was sunk in rum.

"Christmas Cards are becoming an intolerable nuisance.”

Why strive each year to stifle wail and sigh
By weakly sentiment or washy lie ?
Will building chimneys with a syphon’s bend
Demonstrate sparks must, therefore, downward
tend ?
Is happiness increased, grief turned aside
By tweedle-dums-and-dees of “Christmas-tide?”
Let’s have goodwill and peace, and solid dinners,
And harbour-picnics, as become poor sinners !
But all this gush the season brings about
In Christmas cards, is pretty well played out.
Cease twanging twaddles, neither grave nor funny,
Buy no more cards —and ante-ns the money—
Then shall the Christmas of our discontent
Be better kept by being better spent.
What is done can’t be underdone.

Respect old age, for it may remember you in its
will.
The sins of the fathers are never mentioned to
the children.

He stopped suddenly and stared in front of him.
Then he turned tome and said : “Do you see that
girl?”
We were in King-street, Sydney ; it was about
four o’clock on a lovely autumn afternoon, and
Murdoch and I were taking a stroll. Murdoch is a
very old friend of mine. We were at Shrewsbury
together and again at University College, London,
when he was a student of medicine and I a student
of all things in general and nothing in particular.
I had just lit on him in Sydney, just married, and
a flourishing young suburban medico, and we were
full of reminiscence and narrative. We had had
lunch at Compagnoni’s, and were sauntering along
when, turning round one of the corners of Pitt
and King streets, he stopped suddenly, stared in
front of him, turned to me, and said —
“ Do you see that girl ?”
I glanced in the direction indicated by; his eyes
and the wave of the hand holding his cigar, and
saw a lady standing in front of a jeweller’s window
looking carelessly in, rather with the air of a per-
son who was whiling away the moments of an ex-
pected rendezvous than of a passer-by attracted
by the wares exposed. I knew her at once. It
was Mrs. Medwin. Mrs. Medwin is the wife —the
young second wife —of one of our best-known Vic-
torian squatters. Perhaps she was here on the
return from her honeymoon. It was only six or
seven months ago that Medwin married her, and
the two went off at once for a trip to England, pur-
posing to return by New York and San Erancisco.
We were now directly opposite her, and, as she
was still looking in at the window, it seemed im-
probable that she would see us. A small group of
pedestrians, coming from the opposite direction
upon us, compelled me to step ahead of Murdoch.
At that very moment I saw, by the glance I cast
over my left shoulder as I advanced, that she
turned rather suddenly. She almost ran into him.
By the time I had wheeled round it was all over.
Their eyes had met; an extraordinary expression
had flashed over her beautiful face ; he had raised
his hat, she had bowed her head slightly, and then
he was with me and we were walking on together
again and away from her. That impression of her
face as their eyes met is as vivid to me at this
moment as it was then.
I behold her before me as I write. She never
had much colour, but you could not call her pale.
I have seen Italian women at Naples with just her
warm, moulded features like olive-hued marble.
Her eyes had a singular look that reminded me of
the jewelled, enamelled eyes in certain statues.
Whenever I saw her, the prevalent colour of her
dress was always something metallic —golden or
silver or bronze. Probably she did it on purpose.
She knew it suited her peculiar style of beauty. I
saw her married, and the orange and glistering ;
white of her toilette were like solid bronze and
silver. I never thought her cold. She gave me
the impression of passion in a calm and deep
slumber, but I confess that that sudden glimps® of
her face as she saw Murdoch, and the subtle
heightening of its colour —not a blush or even a
flush, it was so faint and evenly distributed-
made her, for the first time, strike me as not only
a beautiful statue but a lovely woman.
He did not repeat his question, and I did not
answer it for quite a minute. We walked on side
by side. Then I said :
“Girl? You would scarcely call her a girl.
She is every inch of her a woman. She is Mrs.
Medwin.”
“ Mrs. Medwin ? Mrs. Medwin ?” he repeated,
vaguely. “ I know the name, somehow.”
“ Medwin is one of the richest men in Victoria
or Australia. His first wife was, perhaps, the
best-known personage in Melbourne ‘society.’
She ruled it like an empress. Imagine the luck of
that great, hulking creature to have found such a
woman as that as her successor ! Did you know
her in England?” I asked mildly, after having
eased him off with this.
But he still refused to be communicative.
I tried a second flight.
“It seems amazing,” I said, “to light on a_ face
or form like her’s here. She is the sort of feminine
one meets in the drawing-rooms of old superb
civilisations, one of the ladies of Imperial Rome, or
mediaeval Florence or Venice, at the court of a Henri
Quatre, or, perchance, at some Viennese embassy.
What has fecund splendour like this to do with
the ‘ ghastly, thin-cheeked ’ aperies of this tenth-
rate pseudo-civilisation of ours here in Australia?
The music to which such a woman walks is that of
a Galuppi or a Chopin ; and, 10, Australian social
life thrills to the vulgar temerity of barbarous
iron-framed pianos, usually bought on the time-
payment system ! She seemed quite unconscious
of us all, thank Heaven ! Everyone was looking
at her, and she paid about as much heed to them
as Faustina did when she sat with poor, dear
Marcus Aurelius in the Imperial box at the amphi-
theatre, and the Roman mob united with the
Roman ‘ society ’ in canvassing her character. ”
“ That is beastly high-flown,” he said, a little
irritably, “I should have thought five years of
Australia would have toned down your exuber-
ant fancy a bit more, old man. ”
We went on right up King-street, and, following
some imperceptible impulse, passed over into
Hyde Park. We entered a shady alley and paced
on side by side, smoking in silence.
“ How she is changed ! ” he said reflectively,
“ And yet not changed. She is just the same—
exactly the same. It is only that she is richer,
riper. She has finer clothes now, and has been
living well. She was inclined to be even a bit
skinny then. I came out in the same ship with
that girl,” he added, to me more directly. “ Her
name was Jackson, Miss Jackson.”
“ It was,” I said.
“ I was doctor on the ship—a sailer, one of the
old Blackwall liners. We came by the Cape, of
course. There were thirteen of us in the saloon,
and the skipper and the first and second mates.
Miss Jackson was one. She came out alone in
the skipper’s charge, or his wife’s, or both, and she
had a cabin to herself. The ship had many cabins
but few passengers.”
He paused for a moment. He was speaking in
a rather dreary way now, looking in front of him
as if at the rising shapes of his memories.
“ I will tell you about her,” he said, “ what I
know. It isn’t much. We were rather above the
average collection of people on board for a sailer.
There were only five women ; the rest men.
There was the skipper’s wife, a stout, rather
showy, but at bottom motherly old soul ; the wife
of one of the passengers, also stout and showy, and
addicted to liquors; an old maid of a long and
lean but rather nice type, reading nice books and
playing nice music ; her cabin-companion, the
grown-up daughter of another of the passengers,
an old colonist who had made his pile ; and,
lastly, Miss Jackson. Among the men there
were two sets, both of which, however, were on
very good terms with each other. There was the
sporting set who played ‘ nap 5 perpetually ; got
up games; fished for sharks or albatrosses, and
the rest. And there was another set that was
Quieter, read the better class of novels, played
chess, and talked rather ‘ intelektooal. ’ The
women had a tendency to keep to themselves.
There was one fellow who understood the whole
lot, and in his quiet way got on with the whole
lot. His name was Allenson.”
He paused again. Then, turning and looking
at me, said :
“ Allenson was just a devil. He was rather
like you.”
I laughed.
“ Thank you,” I said.
“ Not like what you are notv,” he proceeded,
“but like what you were at Shrewsbury, and even
a bit at the college. He was what you call a
thorough gentleman. He was always quite at his
ease, calm, courteous, with lots of tact. He never
showed you he despised you, or, rather, did not
consider you of the very least importance : in fact,
thought himself almost of another flesh and blood
to you ; but that was what in his heart he must
have felt. He never said so, but I am quite cer-
tain he was of a very swell family. I have no idea
what was bringing him out in a Blackwall liner to
Australia. I fancy he had been overdoing things
in town, and had made up his mind to a health-
voyage and some quiet travel at the other end.
I’ll admit that he was the best-looking man I ever
saw. He was a bit intellectual, too. When he
came on board he looked pale and rather worn,
but this soon passed and presently he was magni-
ficent. He dressed finely —in the very best taste,
and he was the only perfectly-made man I ever
met. I can’t tell you how I hated him !”
He looked at me again.
“If you could have been like him,” he said,
“ you would have been happy. He was your ideal
—your ideal when I got to know you first at
school and the college. And this Allenson turned
his eyes on Miss Jackson.”
He threw away the end of his cigar, frowned,
and drove his hands into his pockets.
“You know her?” he said. ‘‘You met her,
perhaps, before she married Medwin ?”
“ I met her once or twice,” I said, “ but it was
nothing. ”
“Well,” he proceeded, “I think she was even
nicer then than she is now. She wasn’t so beauti-
ful. She has
bloomed out
since. She
was rather
thin, and did
not seem ro-
bust; she
was poor,
going out,
an orphan, to a new land, to a
strange home, with a distant rela-
tion who had agreed to take her.
The skipper knew the man —a
half-uncle or something. He lived
up near Sandhurst, and was manager
of a mine. Her outlook was far
from bright. I myself,” he said,
with a sudden rapidity, “ had no
notion of what might be in store
for me, for I wasn’t such a fool as
to think fortunes were to be got
for the mere seeking in Australia
nowadays—but—but— Well, what
am I talking about ?”
“You were talking about Miss
Jackson,” I said, with a smile, in
cidentally wondering to myself what
sort of “ girl ” was the “ girl ” who
presided over the domestic arrange-
ments in that medical suburban
home where I was to partake of
dinner.
“ Allenson,” he proceeded again, “was a ter-
ribly dangerous sort of man for women. No
woman can get over the fact of a genuinely good-
looking man. Even if he’s a fool and a stick, they
can’t get over it—and what can they do, what do
they do, when he is the very reverse of a fool and
a stick ? I watched the devil drop his meshes
round that girl day by day and could do nothing.
I couldn’t even quarrel with him. The man
witched me as he did everybody. Even the stupid
brewer lot —there were three of them—swore by
him. They said he was very ‘ affable !’ It was
sickening !”
He drew his hands out of his pockets in a quick,
nervous manner; leant his elbows on his knees,
and bent forward.
“She got a way, presently,” he said, “of look-
ing up with a curious expression whenever he
came to her or first spoke to her. I knew what
that meant. And yet she was as proud as Lucifer.
Anyone could see that. It came out over and
over again. I never for a moment imagined he
intended marrying her. Men like that don’t
marry till they begin to get bald and take an in-
fatuation, a grande passion—(you know)—or else
they wait till they’ve got heads as bare as billiard-
balls and make fools of themselves. Perhaps he
wasn’t rich enough. He might have sought the
earth through to get a girl to equal her, anyway !
I thought he was amusing himself with her —
creating an ‘ interest ’on the voyage. Not that he
seemed bored, but he had a way of sitting in his
deck-chair, motionless like a statue, looking in
front of him, and I knew he must have found us
dreadful poor company.
“ Then one night in the tropics I got a shock.”
Once more he paused.
“It was a dark warm night,” he said, “no
moon and the stars not very bright. It wasn’t
oppressively hot. There was a steady breeze aft,
sending us along at five or six knots an hour —the
tail-end of the trades. Most of them were down
in the saloon, playing cards, singing or reading.
There was nobody on the poop but the man at the
wheel and the officer of the watch. I came up for a
breath of air and walked down one side of the
poop and round by the helm and up the other. I
had on indiarubber-soled deck-shoes, and it was
so dark, outside of the glare coming from the sides
of the saloon sky-lights, that I was upon them be-
fore I was aware of it. They were standing below
the boat, leaning together; their elbows on the
taffrail, and his hand holding hers. I passed on
immediately and went below.”
He sat up. .
“That was all,” he said, “all I saw of their
love-making. I don’t know how it went. I could
only guess, but that guessing process used to drive
me wild. Tor about a fortnight she looked a
different girl, like a rose-bud that had bloomed
out into a rose. Then came another change. 1
could see her day by day suffering torture. And
I could say no thing—do nothing. I tried once, it
was merely the vaguest expression of sympathy,
of kindly feeling. She would not look at me for a
week. I suffered torture too. I can t describe it.
Especially at nights.”
He paused.
“And so,” he said with a sigh, “day followed
day, and week week, and things went from bad to
worse. He was quite tired of her I know. I used
to long to smash his face in. Not that he behaved
brutally or rudely to her ; I should have done it
if he had. No, he was just the same, calm and
courteous, only to her it was cold and distant, and,
so to say, oblivious. We were round the Cape
now, and into the roaring forties. Some days we
made great runs—2Bo or even 300 miles. We had
the wind right behind us, bowling us along to
Australia at full speed. Then we had a taste of
storm for two days with heavy rain.”
He paused once more, and longer than before,
sitting looking in front of him at the asphalt of
the walk. .
“It was the second evening after the storm, he
went on slowly. “ The ship was close-hauled,
and heeled over very considerably to leeward.
The rain had drawn off a little towards sun-
set, and three or four of them —the skipper, his
wife and the old maid, with one or two of the men
—were walking up and down the weather-side of
the poop, getting up an appetite for dinner. It
grew so dark that you couldn’t seq more than a
few yards clearly in front of you. Every now and
then a shower of spray broke over the poop, and
this ended in driving the ladies below, but the
skipper, one of the young brewers and myself still
kept up our walk and talk. Then I turned off be-
tween the sky-lights and was passing down to the
lee-side of the deck when I was almost lurched
against Miss Jackson. She was standing with her
back to me in just the same position as that other
time. I did not dare to speak to her, and went on
to the ladder. Allenson was
coming up it. I drew back
without a word, and he
mounted and passed me. I
went down on to the main
deck and hung about, talk-
ing with one of the mates.
The first bell for dinner
hadn’t gone yet; so, having
nothing to do, I went up
again by the other ladder on
to the poop to the skipper and
the young brewer, who were
still tramping up and down,
and fell in with them. We
staggered along on the oblique
deck and discussed the con-
struction of iron ships, and
the future of sail as against
steam. About a minute later.
as we were all turning by the ladder, we saw
the form of a woman come out from round
the first sky-light. It was so dark that it was
possible only to guess even that. She came along
steadily to us, and was with us as we made our
first few steps forward together. I knew who it
was, of course, at once. It was Miss Jackson.
She addressed the skipper.
“ Captain,” she said in a quiet voice, “ I heard
a cry, I think. Is everyone on board ? ”
The skipper was incredulous.
“ Where did you hear it ? ” he asked, in a light
tone.
“ Along by the helmsman,” she said. “ Some-
one passed a moment ago, and sat on the rail.”
We left her and went aft to the helmsman.
“ If it’s anyone,” said the skipper, “ it’s Alien-
son. I warned him only yesterday about sitting
on the taffrail.”
“The helmsman said that four or five minutes
ago someone had come and sat on the taffrail
behind him, and then went forward a bit, but it
was dark and he’d such a lot to do to keep her
head up to the wind that he didn’t notice who it
was. That was all. No one ever saw any more
of Allenson.”
He stopped suddenly and showed no sign of con-
tinuing.
“What do you mean ?” I asked. “ How did he
fall overboard ?”
“ I don’t know. No one ever knew. No one
was ever sure, even, that he fell overboard that
evening at that time, or when. The last time he
was seen (unless the helmsman saw him) was up
on the fo’c’sle half-an-hour or so before. Several
people saw him there. ”
“But how can that be,” I asked, “ since you
yourself said you saw him come up the ladder on to
the lee-side of the poop by Miss Jackson ?”
“ Did I say so? I never said so at the investiga-
tion we held.”
He got up.
“ Let’s go on,” he said.
We walked away together.
“ But, look here,” I said, “ I don’t understand.
Do you mean to imply that it was an accident, or
that he went down behind the helmsman and sat on
the taffrail again, talking to her, and she shoved
him over ?”
He had taken out another cigar.
“ What do I know about it anyway?” he said,
biting off the end and spitting it out, “ can you
give us a light ?”
FRANK HAWKESBURS.
Austral Panorama.
( FOR THE BULLETIN. )
Australia floats before me like a ship upon the ocean
In full sail. The sudden and gorgeous drama
Bursts upon my vision.
First scene : James Cook upon his quarter-deck,
Sighting the continent through the blue and
wreathy haze.
Next the Conscript Fathers hewing in the forest
And chalking Sydney out. List to the musical axes
Mixed with a few big, big D's 1
After a dash of vigour, a Rip Van Winkleish life
Absorbed the settlement. My next painting shows
Macarthur and the Merinos. The scene is Camden
And the cow-pastures of the Nepean. Forward !
Behold now Wentworth, Lawson, Blaxland
Ope the book of exploration. On Blue Mountain
tops
They viewthe Bathurst Plains in ravishing beauty ;
Land of corn, wine, oil, and yellow gold.
But ere this I should have shown Sorrento,
Governor Collins’ peg in for Victoria. The French
Had named it Napoleon’s Land, and Hobson’s Bay
They called Port Josephine. But Flinders was
too “ smart.”
I think of him imprisoned for six years
In the Mauritius to baffle his discovery.
I think of Bass, the brave, in open boat.
(They say he died a wretched prisoner
In the silver mines of South America.)
Look! On Sorrento’s Strand plays Master
Johnny Fawkner,
In after time he winds with little schooner
Along the Yarra. He and Batman
Divide the honour. But before their time of glory
Some lines I yet must have for the Explorers,
For Oxley, Sturt, and they lead me on
To Howell, Hume, Mitchell, and M‘Douall Stuart,
Not beat by much when Burke and Wills
With King and Gray first crossed the Continent.
A myriad of other names are on the scroll of honour.
Stand forth now, William Wentworth !
Thy faults were many, Billy Charles, but yet
You did confront the.tyrants, and demand
Freedom of the Press and Jury Trial.
So one green spot, enshrined in memory is
When Martin thrilled us o’er your Yaucluse grave.
But Victoria is the Spear-Head,
Other Provinces the handle in its joints
To stick together like a fishing-rod.
Victoria’s men fought for the Continent:
O’Shanassy and Fawkner led the way
In Liberalism. They fell off, but not the Cause
It forward went to the Eureka ! Yes,
When gallant Peter Lalor stood upon the logs,
With “ Steady, boys ! ” O’er him waved the Flag
Of Australia ! The Southern Cross in stars
Upon a blue ground. Who’s were the fair hands
That made it ? Some patriot sisters’,
Now lying cold and unremembered, but their hearts
Were in a glow for the Republic !
And come it shall.
Shoot down Peter Lalor and those who were mar-
tyred,
Trample on our Flag, tear it from the pole
In derision. It has waved, yea, and will!
A policeman tore it down and jumped upon it,
So they say. Afterwards the brutal soldiery
Carried it through Ballarat in mock triumph.
Is there no sacred fragment yet preserved ?
The Land Convention was an outcome.
“ Unlock the Lands !” was irresistible. The Corner
Grew within the Parliament. Such men as
Wilson Gray, Heales, Don, Syme, and Owens.
Now allow me to turn round some lines I borrow
from Walt Whitman. They form an invocation
You occult, deep volitions,
You average spiritual manhood, purpose of all
Poised on yourself, giving not taking law,
You Womanhood Divine, Mistress and Source of all
Whence Life and Love, with aught that comes from
Life and Love,
You unseen Moral Essence of the vast materials of
Australia !
Working, age upon age, in Death as well as Life,
You Hidden National Will, concealed in its
Abysms, yet ever Alert!
You Past and Present Purposes, tenaciously held,
Maybe unconscious of yourselves.
Unswerved by passing errors, perturbations of the
surface,
You that, sometimes known, far oftener unknown,
Really shape and mould the New World,
Adjusting it to Time and Space,
You Vital, Deathless Germs, that underlie all
creeds —Arts, Statutes, Literatures,
Here build your Homes for good, establish here,
These Areas entire, Lands of my Austral Shore,
We pledge, we dedicate to You !
For man of you, your characteristic Race,
Here may he hardy, sweet, gigantic grow,
Here tower proportionate to Nature !
Here fill the vast, pure spaces unconfined,
Unchecked by wall or roof. Here heed himself,
unfold himself,
Not others’ formulas heed. Here laugh with storm
or sun,
Here joy, patiently endure, and disappear at last
Unrecked, to serve !
The same grand poet, old Walt Whitman,
Writing of his glorious Pacific Slope,
Calls for his sound and noble population—
Not Wan from Asia’s Fetiches,
Nor red with blood from Europe’s old Dynastic
Slaughter Houses,
Area of Murder Plots of thrones, with scent left yet
Of blood and scaffolds everywhere.
Our pattern is no hybrid Canada,
But Free America ! Aye, the land of Washington,
Of Lincoln, Garfield, where the Common People
reign.
To this we will join on. We want New Yorks,
Bostons, Chicagos, Philadelphias, and Oshkoshes,
Arizonas, and Nebraska®. Behold our Model!
Australia, the young sister of America,
Poles positive and negative, Siamese Twins,
E pluribus unum, pro bono publico.
Southern Cross married to the Stars and Stripes—
That’s the ticket! No Pinchbeck, no Prunella.
No Mexican Empire or Brazil upon this continent.
A Monroe doctrine for ourselves.
So run along the panorama ;
The show is only just begun. Old worm-eaten piles
Are rotting off; and soon they’ll all be new.

Respecting the virtues of the Dandelion.
Root in cases of Liver Complaint, and
the many diseases following in its train, we read
in that standard work of Bentley s ( u Medicinal
Plants”) that Dandelion “ is regarded as slightly
Tonic, Aperient and Diuretic. It appears to
have an almost specific action on the Liver, by
modifying and increasing its secretion. Hence
it is extensively employed in Chronic Diseases
of the Digestive Organs, or Enlargement of
the Liver, Dropsies from Hepatic Obstruction,
and Dyspepsia, attended with deficient Biliary
Secretion.”
By the foregoing, it is evident that in the Dandelion

How Glover Lost a Wife.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“ Ain’t she a dainty bit of stuff ?” The senior
member of the firm of Slack and Samson, quartz-
miners, Mount Moliagul, Victoria, sat on the
windlass-handle with his elbows on his knees and
his sharp, angular jaw in his palms and gazed
with a mournful regret after the trim little figure
in cool and tasteful print sailing through the
saplings under a great spread of straw hat that
fanned the air like the wings of a bird as she
buoyantly stepped along. “ She’s immense, don t
you think. Bill ?”
“ Spiffin!” responded the junior partner, with
gloomy enthusiasm.
“ Got a fine eye,” continued the senior member,
envious and meditative.
“ Rippin’ golden hair !”
“ An’ teeth. Say, Glover’s luck’s in.”
“ My oath!”
The senior partner got up, stretched his ridi-
culously long limbs, sighed heavily, and inconti-
nently slid below, using the paid-out rope as a
medium of transit. The junior partner sighed
with greater intensity as he caught the last dove-
like nutter between the trees, and stationed him-
self at the windlass for an hour’s pulling combined
with grave meditation.
Lucy Davis was nobody in particular to the firm
of Slack and Samson. The emotions excited in
the honest souls of the partners when that charm-
ing young creature smiled up at them in passing
from out the grateful shade under the wide brim
of her sun-hat, were felo in a like manner by the
majority of the single men on the lead every time
Miss Lucy’s natty summer dresses came flitting
through the bushes, and might be defined as a
momentary discontent at their own loneliness
and a vague ambition that fate in the future might
bestow upon them just such another little mate as
Lucy Davis. These emotions were, however, com-
bined with a sense of personal ill-treatment, for it
was felt that the prize was not bestowed in an
appreciative quarter.
Fate, however, has few like Miss Lucy in stock;
the supply is small and the demand unlimited.
She was nineteen, below the average height, fair,
with a glorious burden of bright chestnut hair,
which, despite her impatient efforts to brush it down
smooth in accordance with the prevailing style,
would persist in running up in soft, regular ripples
again almost immediately, to the great satisfaction
of all beholders. She had large, shy, blue eyes,
with long lashes and arched brows two shades
darker than her hair. It is foolish to describe a
face; we may say this feature is thus, and that is
so and to, and every reader will picture a different
countenance —but Miss Lucy’s was perfection
glorified. It had that light that seems to invite
protection, and which proud, arrogant man so
appreciates in the woman he loves, but which
nevertheless fails to win her the approval of those
strong, stern ladies who pass their lives in a
tremendous excitement about their rights. Her
figure was slight but well rounded, there was a
touch of native dignity in her walk, and her
natural gaiety was demurely restrained by a due
appreciation of the enormous responsibilities of a
young lady of nineteen, who had to keep house —
no, tent—for her father.
Miss Lucy wended her way along the brow of
the hill towards the head of the lead until she
reached the claim of Messrs. Davis and Glover.
Here she seated herself on the reef under the shade
of the “ win’sa’l ” that hung limply in the shaft,
and, producing materials from her basket, pro-
ceeded to knit a stocking to a merry tune, sung
very softly, whilst the strokes of picks drummed
faintly in the bowels of the earth below, and the
roseilas, swinging head-downward s from the
boughs of an adjacent whitegum and burying their
heads in the abundant blossoms, murmured an oc-
casional twitter of gluttonous satisfaction. The
belle of Mount Moliagul had not been knitting
many minutes before a spasmodic jerking of the
windlass rope caused her to drive her needles at
express speed and assume a deceitful air of pre-
occupation. The oscillations of the rope became
shorted and quicker, and presently a hairy arm
came into view ; it was followed by a hairy face,
and a small, bright man of about 45, with splashes
of clay on his face and in his whiskers, and alter-
nate patches of clay and candle-grease pretty well
all over him, drew himself up quietly, and seated
himself on the edge of the shaft; he watched the
young lady for a few moments, and marked with
apparent satisfaction the delicate briar-rose pink
of her cheeks and the little, moist curls upon her
brow and about her small ears. Miss Lucy’s pre-
occupation was now very intense indeed.
“’Elio ugly!” said the small, bright man.
“ You here ? ”
“ ’Elio, dad ! that you ? ” Lucy was surprised.
“That’s me; s’pose you expected someone
better, eh ?”
“ Someone better, dad ! There’s no one better
on this lead. Goin’t’ pull dirt ? ’
“ No; goin’ over to Buckley’s forge t’ point
these picks.” Davis had now landed several
used-up tools. “ There ain’t much haulin t’ do,
Loo, th’ durned reef’s es hard es blazes, if she
don’t make fresh we’ll have t’ do some shootin .
When I come back I’ll send George up t’ get th’
water out, though ; I suspect that’ll do you.”
Miss Loo insisted that she was not particularly
anxious to have George on the surface, but her
loving parent was incredulous, and retreated
grinning in an old-fashioned way. It would have
been difficult for the young lady to explain exactly
how she felt towards Mr. George Glover : she was
going to marry him, she believed, and had never
entertained any serious objection to the arrange-
ment. He was a fine, big fellow, good-looking
enough, young enough, steady enough, and suit-
able enough for a miner’s daughter ; he had been
her father’s mate for two years, and she liked
him They had associated a good deal during
thtli - acquaintance,;had taken Jong walks together!,,
and there was a tacit understanding that;
they were to be husband and wife “ some-
day.” George had never taken her in his
arms, and said: “I love you —be my wife,’*'
he was not that kind of a young man. He waS >
a heavy sort of fellow, physically and intel-
lectually ; he thought that when a nian visited
a girl frequently And, ithey strolled together and
were civil to each other for a certain length of’
time they naturally nieaftt matrimony and,, there,
was no necessity for any excitement about the mat-
ter. He was immensely pleased with the state of
affairs, but he was unworthy of his luck —it is;
ridiculous to waste champagne on a man who-
would be as well pleased with beer. Mr. Glover
could not appreciate the pretty, piquant damsel,
whom fortune was about to lavish on him as she
deserved—her flavour was thrown away on him.
“ Halloa ! on top there ! 1”
“ Be-e-low !”
“Er yer goin’ t’send down that blessed pick,
or must I stick here an’ freeze ?”
This was Mr. Glover ; he was in a bad temper
evidently. Her father had forgotten the pick, but
she could send it down easily enough. It was a
simple matter to fasten the pick on the rope, she
had seen it done times out of mind, and knew how
perfectly well.
“Hi, hi,” she responded in her father’s voice.
There was a sharp pick by the windlass-stand
that must be the one; in a few seconds it was pn
i
the rope.
“ Look up, below ?”
She gave the rope a pull and the windlass re-
volved rapidly, but, to the great horror of the girl,
the pick had no sooner swung into the shaft than
it keeled right over and slipped but of the hitch.
There was a whiz, followed by a simultaneous (|ry
and a splash, and then silence. In that second] of
time every vestige of colour had fled from Lucy’s
face. She fell on her knees and peered wildly
down into the darkness below.
“George!” Something dn hefc , throat choked
the cry, and it was only a harsh whisper.
“George! George!!” Her voice had broken
its bonds now and was shrill and agonised.
“Speak, George! dear George, why don’t jfou
answer me ?” i . ~ \ \
Not a whisper came back, and the girl got on] to
her feet again and gazed towards the other claims
along the lead with desperate eyes. Her face was
strangely transformed by the agony of fear that
possessed her, it looked old and drawn. Ihe
thought that flashed ujW her was that thd pick
had struck her lover as he waited to receive it at
the mouth of the drive, the well-boards were pff,
and he would assuredly be driven into the water
by the blow, so that if he were not-already dead,
he would drown before assistance came. Her
mind was made up in an instant; no-
men on the surface at the other mines, and there
■was no tipie to call them, up. She had a horror of,
the/dark, echoing shafts, but that was forgotten
now. Shb paid out ; the • rope with desperate
energy, and • when that was done seized ife with
her small hands and started down as she
had often seen the men do. Her feet slipped
mechanically into the toe-holes on cither side
of the narrow shaft, and no touch of fear, no
thought of her danger entered her soul. There
were rough sets of timber at various distances
upon which- she might have rested, but she did
not pause for an instant. Down, down, with a
numbed body and a mind so confused that she
scarcely realised what she was doing, and at
length her feet struck upon a slab that had been
thrown across the well, and she - stood upright, her
eyes yet blinded by the sudden transition from
the bright sunlight.
“Jerusalem! Loo!”
She could now dimly discern a dark figure
moving in the drive before her. The exclamation
of amazement was followed by a roar of laughter
that lasted nearly a minute and shocked the girl
terriblv. She was leaning against the side of the
shaft, trembling in every limb, and from the tips
of her lacerated fingers large drops of blood fell
into the water.
“ You—you were not hurt then ? ” she contrived
to whisper.
“ Hurt, no! I thought I’d scare you, but who d
a-thought you’d have th’ pluck to come down!
By thunder, it’s rich ! ” And again he laughed
immoderately.
She could comprehend at last. He was safe, he
had played a brutal joke upon her, and that coarse
merriment was the reward of her action. She
despised him for it. The revulsion of feeling
left her weak and sick.
“ Be quick,” she said, “you must pull me up. I
can’t breathe here ! ”
“I didn’t reckon on you cornin’ down, you
know,” he said apologetically, struck by the
peculiar tone of her voice.
“ I must go on top ! ”
He- hooked the hide bag on the rope, showed her
how to ride by placing one foot in and steadying
herself with the other, and then hastened up the
shaft. v
“ Look up, below ! ”
She felt the rope tighten, and was drawn up
again towards the surface. Her father returned
whilst Glover was at the windlass, and he was
now kneeling at the mouth of the hole, peering
anxiously down at the set, white face slowly rising
out of the subterranean gloom.
“Quicker, man !” gasped the father, something
in that face striking a thrill of horror through his
frame. >
“ Quicker, fqr the love of Heaven ! Almighty
God !” Davis clutched madly at the bleeding
hands, but they slipped down the rope from under
his fingers, the girl sank back, the windlass
whizzed, and she was gone.
She was still breathing when they brought her
broken form to the surface, but on the following
afternoon she died. And that is how Glover lost a
wife,

The Roaring Days.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
The night too quickly passes
And we are growing old,
So let us fill our glasses
And toast the Days of Gold :
When finds of wond’rous treasure
Set all the South ablaze,
And you and I were faithful mates
All through the roarin’ days !
Then stately ships came steering
From ev’ry harbour’s mouth,
And sought the land of promise
That beaconed in the South ;
Then southward streamed their streamers
And swelled their canvas full
To speed the wildest dreamers
E’er borne in vessel’s hull !
And ’neath the sunny dadoes,
Against the lower skies,
The shining Eldoradoes
Forever would arise ;
And all the bush, awakened,
Was stirred in wild unrest,
And all the year a human stream
Went pouring to the West.
The rough bush roads re-echoed
The bar-room’s noisy din,
When troops of stalwart horsemen
Dismounted at the inn.
Then oft the hearty greetings
And hearty clasp of hands,
Would tell of sudden meetings
Of friends from other lands ;
When, puzzled long, the new-chum
Would recognise at last.
Behind a bronze,d and bearded skin,
A comrade of the past.
And when the cheery camp-fire
Suffused the bush with gleams,
The camping-grounds were crowded
With caravans of teams ;
Then home the jests were driven,
And good old songs were sung,
And choruses were given,
The strength of heart and lung.
Oh, they were lion-hearted
Who gave our country birth ! ... ,
Oh, they were of the stoutest sons
From all the lands on earth.
Oft when the camps were dreaming,
And fires began to pale,
Then thro’ the ranges gleaming
Would come the Royal Mail.
Then, drawn by foaming horses
And lit by flashing lamps,
Old “ Cobb and Co.’s,” in Royal State,
Went dashing past the camps.
Oh who would paint a gold-field,
And paint the scene aright
As we have often seen it
In early morning’s light ;
The yellow mounds of mullock
With spots of red and white,
The scattered quartz that glistened
Like diamonds in light,
The azure line of ridges,
The bush of darkest green,
The little homes of calico
That dotted all the scene.
I hear the fall of timber
From distant flats and fells,
The pealing of the anvils
As clear as little bells,
The rattle of the cradle,
The clack of windlass-boles,
The flutter of the crimson flags
Above the golden holes.
Ah, then our hearts were bolder,
And if our fortune frowned,
Our swags we’d lightly shoulder
And tramp to other ground.
But golden days are vanished
And altered is the scene,
The diggings are deserted
The camping-grounds are green.
The flaunting flag of progress
Is in the West unfurled,
The mighty bush with iron rails
Is tethered to the world.

The Legend of Mammon Castle.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
In the days that will be olden after many years
are gone,
Ere the world emerged from darkness floating out
into the dawn.
Oh a mountain rising steeply from the depth of
marsh and wood
Lowering proudly o’er the lowlands Mammon
Castle proudly stood —
Mammon Castle, built of marble that was cut and
reared with pain
By the poor and starving wretches who were serfs
on that domain—
All the jewel-studded windows shone at sunset like
a fire,
And a d amend was flashing from the needle of
*he spire.
iNow the nobles held thecastle by a title that was
old,
And they drank from crystal goblets and they ate
from plates of gold ;
The coffers of the eastle they were plenished by the
thralls,
And many were the revels that were held in
Mammon’s halls.
And the plunder from the toilers more than paid
for silks and wine,
So the flower-beds were bordered with the ; jewels
~ of the mine,
All the serfs were taught to worship both the lady
and the lord,
And the nobles taught their children to be wiser
far than God.
But a vassal preached sedition and m a gloomy
hour
Camb the wild and haggard vassals to the gate of
Mammon Tower ;
They asked for food and shelter and were answered
by a blow,
And, rising in their anger, soon they laid the
castle low.
The jewels of the castle went to buy the people
bread,
And according to his labour was the toiler clothed
and fed.
And with the wood and marble—my dreaming
tells me so—
Many little homes were budded in the valleys
down below '

This page is devoted to the description
of the business of E. Rowlands, the famous
manufacturer of Soda water and a
variety of other non-alcoholic beverages,
which has long been recognised as the
leading colonial industry. This pheno-
menally successful business was started
in the year 1854, at Ballarat, soon after
the discovery of gold in that neighbour-
hood. Mr. Rowlands
and his late partner,
Mr. Lewis, under the
name and title of
Rowlands and Lewis,
took the tide at its
rise when they
began manufacturing
Aerated Waters by
manual labour in a
tent on the edge of
Youl’s Swamp, now
known as Lake Wen-
douree, Ballarat. In
the year 1858, the
firm could foresee the
success of the busi-
ness, and during that
year they built a sub-
stantial Factory on
the corner of Sturt
and Dawson Streets,
and introduced what
is known as Taylor’s No. 1 Machine—the
first ever used in Australia —and at once
took the lead as A-erated Water Manu-
facturers.
By 1870 the Sturt-street factory
proved inadequate to the increased de-
mand, so the firm erected a model fac-
tory, occupying about an acre of ground
on the corner of Dana and Doveton
streets, and fitted it up with the most
complete and perfect set of machinery.
When this was completed the fame of
the Ballarat soda and other waters
spread over the whole colony of Victoria,
and to some extent in the other colonies.
As the business developed and the re-
putation of the firm for the best quality
of water extended, it was deemed ad-
visable to open a branch in Melbourne.
So in 1873 a factory was opened at 116
Collins-street W., the Ballarat factory
supplying the Melbourne Branch with
soda and all other mineral waters. This
was very soon found to be a step in the
right direction, for not only did the excel-
lence of the waters soon find favour both
among private customers and the best
hotels in and about the Victorian metro-
polis, but it opened out a much wider
field as the fame of the Ballarat Soda,
Yigorine, &c., seemed to spread with the
most wonderful rapidity to the other
colonies, and even to India, Fiji, San
Francisc®, «fec. In 1876, Mr. Robert
Lewis retired from the partnership, and
Mr. Rowlands became sole proprietor,
and though his untiring energy and care
in supplying the public with nothing but
' the very best that money could purchase
in his line of business, he has managed to
establish the largest Aerated Water
Business in Australasia. Finding that
the demand for the waters was rapidly
increasing in the colony of New
South Wales he opened a Dep6t in
Sydney in the year 1883 in Hunter-
street, and, as the waters were found to
be as much appreciated in Sydney or
N.S.W. as they are in Melbourne or Vic-
toria, he was forced, in the interest of
his business as well as the convenience of
the public, to build a factory in Sydney.
This factory was built two years ago at the
corner of Burns and Little Hay Streets,
Darling Harbour. It is for the most
part three stories high, and everything
seems to be designed with a view of one
specific purpose—that purpose being the
saving of labour, time, and space, so that
each man and each machine may be
enabled to accomplish the largest
possible results in every process of
the manufacture. The division of
labour is so complete, as also the
efficiency of the machinery which is
of the best and latest manufacture—
that the various operations are performed
with the regularity of clockwork.
From what may be gathered it is
improbable that any one takes
greater care to get clean and thoroughly
wholesome water than Mr. Rowlands
does. The water is first turned on
to a,, large filter on the top floor which
has three compartments, each being a
filter, through which the water passes
and empties itself into a large tank cap-
able of storing 1259 gallons. From this
the water is run into four solid marble
tanks capable of storing 260 gallons each.
Here again the water is once more fil-
tered before being run into the rack to
be aerated and bottled for use. Still with
all the expense, labour, and care in clear-
ing and purifying the town water, the
proprietor was not satisfied, and has been
searching for a spring of pure water for
the last two years. Finally, a spring was
discovered at Katoomba of the clearest
and purest water that can possibly be
procured, which was analysed by Prof.
W. A. Dixon, at the Sydney School of
Arts, with the following results :
Analysis of Katoomba Water.
The water from the spring at Ka-
toomba gives an analysis :
Oxide of Iron ... ... o‘7
Carbonate of Lime ... 4‘6
Carbonate of Magnesia ... 0-5
Chloride of Sodium ... 2*6
8-4
Inorganic ammonia—Traces.
Organic ammonia—o - 01 pts. per
million.
This is a very excellent spring water,
wonderfully free from organic matter.
W. A. DIXON, F.I.C., F.C.S.
Mr. Rowlands has now made all ar-
rangements to get this water brought
to the factory at Darling Harbour,
where there is a large tank built under
the floor of thick brick and cement
wall, impervious to any impurities and
capable of storing over 2000 gallons of
water. At Katoomba may be seen a large
tank with a storage for 3000 gallons. Into
this the water from the spring is pumped
up by means of a Tangye Steam Engine
and Force Pump—and from whence it
gravitates through pipes into a railway
truck which was built for Mr. Rowlands
by the well-known firm of Messrs. Yale
and Sons, Engineers, Auburn. The most
important factor in the manufacture of
Aerated Waters is the sufficient supply
of the purest spring water, and this
spring at Katoomba is capable of supply-
ing over 25 tons of water in 24 hours.
For the future all Rowlands’ Aerated and
Mineral Waters will be manufactured
from the Katoomba spring water, and
the natural result will be, no doubt, the
supply of waters which will meet with
the approval on all sides, and will, by
their superior quality, create a very large
demand. It needs no seer to pro-
phesy the success of this industry, and
indeed anyone who, like Mr. R., spares
no trouble or expense to endeavour to pro-
duce an article that cannot be excelled
in the world is highly deserving of suc-
cess. The “ Yigorine ” may be confidently
recommended as one of the most pleasant
and refreshing beverages that we have
ever tasted, it contains some very valu-
able medicinal properties and should be
kept in every private house, especially
for the use of or where there are
children. It contains Hypo-phosphite of
Lime, which has a tendency to produce
bone in the young, also to sustain the
tissues of brain and body. This fact
should be borne in mind by parents, or
those in charge of children growing up,
especially those residing in Sydney and
the suburbs, as the water supply contains
but a very small proportion of lime.
The illustration shows an ingenious in-
vention called Rowlands’ Patent Draught
Column, invented by the proprietor and
which is patented in all the Australian
Colonies, New Zealand, Great Britain and
most of the European Countries. The
Soda Water is manufactured in Steel
Fonts or Cylinders, lined inside with
block tin. These fonts will contain 10
gallons of pure sparkling Soda Water,
manufactured from the Katoomba Spring
Water, charged at a much higher
pressure than in the strongest bottles.
The fonts are connected with the Draught
Column by a long length of block
tin piping which passes through an
Ice Cooler so that the customers
are served with a cool and refreshing
glass of the best Soda Water that can
possibly be procured. This should be
welcome news to all the best hotels in the
Metropolis and country as well—for the
great advantage of this system is obvious
as it means a better article than any
produced—at a cheaper rate—and a bar-
maid or barman can attend to the wants
of a far greater number of customers
than if they had to open any kind of
bottled waters. A large portion of the
second floor is devoted to the manu-
facture of Cordials, Liqueurs, Bitters,
<fec., all of which are manufactured from
the purest ingredients, and is fitted
with the most approved appliances.
The Lime Juice Syrup is manufactured
from the crude Montserrat Lime Jnice —
Mr. R. having so arranged with the pro-
prietors of this famous article that he
has the sole right of purchase of their
Lime Juice in bulk in the colonies. All
visitors calling at the Factory express
themselves much pleased with the excel-
lent quality of the Curacoa, Maraschino,
Ginger Wine, Lime Juice, Milk Punch,
«fec., &c., and are generally surprised that
these articles can be so successfully
manufactured in the colony. These
Cordials, Liqueurs, &c., obtained the Gold
Medal at the last Calcutta Exhibition.

The Meditations of Michel Tergovitch
(BOUND FOR THE GALLOWS.)
Illimitable treasures of the sun,
Which lie beyond this darkness, my soul’s sight
Makes present prize of, and the hoarded wealth
Of liberty and law, the sacred years
Have heaped and guarded, honest stewards all.
One prison-chamber, empire-vast, one grave
To bury Hope alive in, cheek by jowl
With all she loved to think on, one wide hell
Of unsunned darkness, unviewed misery—
Why that’s the Russian Empire to a hair !
An insect in the key-hole of a door,
A door that holds great millions, barred and bound
From life and sunlight—that’s the Russian Czar.
I held the key that would have turned the lock,
But—crush the sacred insect ? How they raved,
Some of these fellow-prisoners of mine !
The sacred insect, in the key-hole born,
Bred in the key-hole, keeps the key-hole still,
And I shall hang to-morrow, in the dark,
For daring at his cost to long for light!
Fanaticism will exaggerate,
And I’m fanatical enough, God knows !
The Czar’s as much a man as I am. More
I scarce can grant him. Had I wished him ill
I had not raised a hand against his life.
He knows, he knows that key-hole’s no safe place
For any little harmless thing to live in ;
Some hand, some day, will turn the rusted lock—
He scarce can care t o think it, but he knows.
Now for three days, the bitterness of Death
Has fouled my palate, and I know the taste.
All other savours killed, and only this
Left to make starved veins crawl, and chilled
heart heave,
And sick soul shudder with intense disgust ;
Till now at last the cause becomes the cure,
And by to-morrow I have done with fears,
While he lives on, and stands condemned to live,
With that same horrible morsel on his tongue
To make his wine a poison, and his meat
A nauseating fear ! I wish him ill
That proffered him the peace death brings to me ?
Well. Good-bye little Tirza ! Ah, the Czar—
I had not thought of that —says his good-byes
With bitterer and more anxious heart than mine,
And I’ve a soul for pity. Let the snake
Live out her damned ophidian life, and rear
The little brood she loves. Were I the snake
There should be some insistance on snake-rights t
Were I the Czar, Young Michel Tergovitch
Should hang as high as Hainan in the tale.
Right on all sides. And—Tirza, dear, good-bye,
My soul has sight beyond the body’s walls,
A prison in a prison, in a prison ;
I see you, resolute and calm and pale—
You will be there to-morrow. Gentle heart,
Grow brave with anguish, guard your valour well,
I shall have need oflt, as you of mine.
I have a vision, vast beyond my words —
A staircase where each monstrous stair lies spread
Wide as a kingdom, high to scale the clouds.
About the base, the stench of blood, the slime
Of blood, that, like an ocean half-congealed,
Shudders and crawls beneath the shameless dark.
Thick darkness round the base, and scattering mists
Above the darkness, and a light beyond
That grows, as the soul mounts, unbearable.
Along the stairs with toil and pain and tears,
The people of all nations slowly climb
Up, up to that ineffable light, whence God
Rains His own radiance down, and O my love,
My land, my father, here is my award :
One grain of dust cemented by my blood
Shall help to build that stair-case. But one grain.
Would it were more ! And yet I die content.
DAVID CHRISTIE MURRAY.
“Searle is Dead.”
Dear Bulletin, — There is a story of an
Eastern potentate who watched, with great
amazement, some Englishmen playing cricket—
“ In my country,’ he said, “ we make the slaves
do all that sort of violent exercise.” It has got
to be much the same with all the nations of the
earth. The machines, the great slaves with
muscles of iron and nerves of steel, do all
the violent exercise, nowadays. The men sit,
pale-faced and hollow-eyed, and watch the
machines toiling and striving, and the men
become in time the slaves of the machines, instead
of the other way about.
* * *
When any talk is heard of athletic exercise,
of bodily strength and soundness, the effeminate
say : “Are not the machines, our slaves, stronger
than men? What is the use of all this athletic
fever? What need is there of violent exertion?
They look upon Australians as athletic mad ; but
if a nation is not sound and strong what happiness
will it have, though its engines and machines be
never so intricate ? That is why we take a pride
in always being able to put forward a man as a
type of our national strength and soundness and
to say to the world, “Have done with your talk
of servants and machines, bring out your Man !”
* * *
And our representative man, our champion
at the most honest and manly of athletic exer-
cises, was this man, Henry Ernest Searle. He
was a national property, this white-haired young
giant from the Clarence River. While he lived
we felt that for years to come we could defy the
world to turn out a better man. All over Aus-
tralia by all classes of people his career was
watched with intense interest. And just at the
outset of his life, in the strength of early man-
hood, he is carried off. We have lost our strong
man, where shall we find such another?
For he was a wonder. He was an almost
perfect combination of great strength and won-
derful activity. His chest was marvellously deep
and round, his limbs were magnificent and in
grand proportion, and his constitution was of iron.
He was a relic of the old sea-kings of the past,
the men who fought all day and drank deeply at
night—men of naked inherent strength, such as
the world may never see again. We are a nation
living much in the open air and turning out fine,
well-grown men, but it will be many a day before
we turn out another like Searle. His ability as a
sculler was simply an outcome of his marvellous
physical completeness. There are many stronger
men than Searle, but they are clumsy ; and there
are many quicker and more active men, but none
so powerful and determined. Well, he is gone
now. He will be able to give old Charon some
wrinkles as he ferries him over the dark river.
# * #
We will probably never know actually how
good as a sculler Searle was. No man we had
here could extend him. No man in England could
have made him hurry : the only man the Ameri-
cans thought fit to match against him was made a
show of. Is it any wonder that all over Australia
the news of his death was received with sadness ?
“Only a professional sculler,” you say. Well,
perhaps so ; but while manly strength and sound-
ness go for anything, while pluck and endurance
and stamina are qualities worth preserving, so
long may any country be proud of turning out a
man such as Henry Ernpst Searle.

wildering and impotent endeavour to execute all
his important duties at once, and at the same time
mop his head with a bandana and fan the ther-
mometer to keep the temperature below 700 in
the shade, the dough-headed and Vacuous youth
lifted’’ his black suit full of long, lank curate into
the office, and hung over the evaporating editor,
and enquired in an exasperating tone of sacerdotal
commiseration if that perspiring and tremen-
dously-occupied gentleman of letters was saved,
and did he know there was a place prepared for
the devil and his angels, also what the prophet
said, and where he expected to go. to when he
died. The small journalist with the scraped head
had not time to swear and relieve his feelings, but
lie said he wasn’t saved —he was too busy, and he
told the curate to get out and be hanged, and go
and be a nuisance in a place where he would not
impede business and militate against the efficiency
of an undersized man with a newspaper to con-
duct and wood to cut. But the bilious incubus
would not remove his offensive length and mad-
dening drawl, he stayed for half-an-hour, ob-
structing the editor in the execution of his duty,
and impairing his intellect with a second-hand
sermon bearing on the necessity of immediate
salvation and constant attendance at the prayer-
meetings, and with his smug and clammy aspect
and horrid intonation, like the doleful nocturne of
a discontented frog. The young but unwholesome
gospel-distorter told the journalist that he had
determined to snatch him as a brand from the
burning; taking his cue from a malignant tract
which describes the conversion of an iniquitous
soldier, he beset the distressed editor on all times
and occasions, drifting in with his insane query :
“ Are you saved ?” at unseasonable moments, and
fading out again like a theatrical banshee before
he could be disfigured. He met the pressman at
every turn with his abominable theological inquisi-
tion, stole up against him out of the darkness at
midnight and murmured “Are you saved?” in-
truded on the sanctity of his backyard, and in-
vaded his office during hours to propound the
same laconic gag. The editor gave way to gin and
bitterness, and resorted to long, strong, indigenous
profanity, and placed heavy articles and pans of
second-hand machine oil where they would fall on
the curate ; but the latter came up through the
wreckage with his old glare of pensive resigna-
tion, and wrung the grease out of his hyacinthine
locks, and caressed the spot where the spanner
landed with an air of Christian fortitude, and
gently asked the tottering pressman was he saved;
then got out with a wriggle to avoid ink-bottles,
paper-weights, and other recriminative measures.
The curate was still progressing unfavourably
according to latest intelligence, and in the in-
terests of the freedom of the press we direct pub-
lic indignation against the raging clergyman, and
request the Federal Parliament to hurry up and
resort to violence.

The Downfall of Dyspepsia.
It has long been a matter for complaint that the
collective Sydney stomach is badly catered for.
The fastidious eater, the diminutiveness of whose
appetite is in strict harmony with the.vacuity of
his money-bags, gets sorefooted searching for some
spot where cool or caloric sustenance is served at
a moderate charge by attendants who combine
cleanliness, civility and celerity in a consistent
effort to gain your cash, and while great advance
is being made in this respect there is still room at
the top; and the Australian Natural Minera
Water Co. propose to take a leading step by
knocking two shops into one at the King-
street tram stopping-place, and fitting the same a s
an airy waiting and refreshment-room, where the
intending-traveller may rest and indulge in the
cool, fizzling carbonated beverage or the more
substantial lunch, while an automatic tram-
indicator tells him just how long he may have
to listen to the praises of Australian Natural
Mineral Waters before his snorting Juggernaut
bringeth escape; for it seems that the elaborate
fitting up of this place is but a step towards
popularising water. In other words, it is in-
tended to make the virtues of Colonial Mineral
Springs as well known as those of the Spas, and
Saratogas of the other side, and, consequently, a
long list of Natural Mineral Waters com-
prising Carbonates, Sulphates and Chalybeates
will soon puzzle the seeker after some cool,
healthful dilutant with which to ease the edge
of the regulation nip and enliven the - sluggish
liver.
Let us say—be sure that it blends, and partici
pants will be as comfortable as were those old-
time worthies who emptied a keg of the craythur
into the Rock Mat Soda Spring and had a most
delightful time while they could see to dip.
However, this Brandy-and-Soda Spring is away
up in Monaro under the shining slopes of the
Snowy Range, and we, alas ! are sweltering here.
Let us talk of the immediate, which is this
new establishment now being fitted up by
Mr. I. B. Millner, the trans-Pacific Apostle
of a sobriety that is conducive to internal
perturbation, the manager of the Australian
Natural Mineral Water Co., and the agent for
The Firm of John Matthews, New York, whose
mission appears to be the development of Mineral
Springs and the introduction of the latest and
best means of handling the product thereof.
Inside is a fine hall, 30 feet by 80 feet,
with a lofty and beautifully decorated ceiling.
This room is divided into three compartments—
one for the general public, one for ladies, who
have thoughtfully provided themselves with a
male-purse-bearing escort, and a third for those
ladies who, having gone through the old man’s
clothes overnight, are independent of pecuniary
masculine assistance. Here at small, round,
marble-topped tables, capable of seating three or
four only, will be served tea, coffee, cocoa, beef-
tea, milk, every kind of fruit-syrup beverage and
non-intoxicant, fruit, confectionery, sandwiches,
cakes, buns, boiled eggs, and ice creams—frozen
in the piece for transit so solidly that every
love-sick swain may win smiles from his best girl
at anytime by depositing chunks of it in the
letter-box at .all hours of the day and night. In
the centre of the room stand the counters
whence all these good things will be despatched,
a carbonated-beverage apparatus manufactured
by the Firm of John Matthews, New York, and a
miniature dairy with separators and churns in full
work driven by an electric motor. Here the
butterine-dodging luncher may put in his cream
at one end of the machine and withdraw—in a
perfectly bald, that is, hairless condition—a pat
of butter and glass of milk at the other.
At the rear are the retiring rooms for ladies
and gentlemen. Between, stands a powerful
gas-engine that will pump down, after the mode
recommended by Sir John Lubbock, ozone
from the pure air strata that lie many feet
above the house-tops, and disseminate it by
means of ever-whirling fans throughout the
entire establishment. This gas-engine will also
generate the heat for hot-water-making purposes,
and in the winter months will take the chill
off the pure atmosphere before dishing it up
for the lungs of Mr. Milner’s patrons. It will also
supply the motive power to the electric motor in
the model dairy and generate the electricity that
will light the premises at night. For this place
of refreshment will be open as long as the trams
continue to run. The light (incandescent) will be
laid on by the Messrs. Kingsbury, the well-known
electricians, but will differ considerably from any-
thing seen here previously, in that the dazzling
brilliancy of which so many people complain will
be softened below the glare so much disliked.
There are many other items of convenience and
comfort-securing features which are novel and
will be appreciated to such an extent that the
place bids fair to become a favourite point of rest
for many who daily suffer agonies while trying to
protect a pet corn from the rush of the crowd on
the pavement.
We are glad to see an industry of this character
spring, likewise pop up, and consider that the
carefully /Mated Waters previously alluded to
ought to go off with a loud and effervescent bang,
while “taking well and giving pleasure to all,”
whether taken only in their native beauty unde-
filed or combined with other liquids of a stimulat-
ing tendency and alcoholic character. Drunkenness
is a bad thing, but prohibition is impossible, and
the commonsense way out of the drink difficulty
is to add as much soda to your whisky as the land-
lord can afford to give for the money. The fuller
a man is of soda the less room he has for spirits ;
this being so Mr. Milner’s venture ought to be
largely subsidised by the teetotal fraternity.


Is no doubt the great question of the day,
so ALSO
WARNERS SAFE REMEDIES
Are the Medicines for the Times.
Read the following proofs among many hundreds lately received that they do exactly
as represented —
Queenton, Charters Towers, Queensland,
Sept. 12th, 1889.
I am 43 years of age, and for the past 23
years,l have been a great sufferer from disease
of the kidneys, often so severe in its nature as
to make life almost too great a burden to bear.
I had what the doctors called “ the uric acid
diathesis,” attended by gravel or sand-like
sediment and scalding sensations, and suffered
terrible pains in the left side, the loins, and
down the thighs, which caused me countless
sleepless nights, and any exertion when seized
with these severe fits of gravel, would pros-
trate me entirely. I consulted the most re-
nowned doctors in England, but their combined
efforts were useless in giving me any material
relief. When leaving Yorkshire, my doctor
informed me I could not recover, and that the
presence of stone in the kidneys and bladder
would seriously endanger my life. I arrived
three years ago, with my husband (who from
his youth followed the vocation of a miner)
in Charters Towers. At that time I suffered
excruciating pains from the stones lodged in
the kidneys and bladder. My nervous system
became exhausted, and in brief death would
have been a relief from the intense torture.
I suffered day and night. The doctor here did
everything in his power, but like my English
physicians, could not grapple with this terrible
affliction. Hearing so much about “ Warner’s
Safe Cure ” my husband procured a number of
bottles. While using a third bottle I experi-
enced great relief. On the 3rd of March, 1888,
when taking the 14th bottle of “ Warner’s Safe
Cure,” a stone passed and, after great agony,
was expelled. The stone measured l|-inch in
length, and over IJ-inch in circumference, being
pointed at both ends. I continued the use of
“ Warner’s Safe Cure” regularly, which some-
what relieved my pains. Eight days afterwards
under great pain, I passed another calculus
about the same size, but thicker at both ends.
I continued with the “ Safe ” Cure, which
healed the inflammation of the urethra. The
doctor on hearing of it, came to see the stones,
and stood amazed, hardly realizing the fact
of my recovery. These stones passed by me,
judging from the doctor’s remarks, are some
of the largest on record. For a week or two
afterwards I still eliminated a lot of gritty
matter, when my suffering was ended. Since
then my recovery has been rapid and com-
plete and I have gradually
gained in strength and weight. I took
in all 30 bottles of “Warner’s Safe Cure,”
and I feel as if I could not express sufficiently
my gratitude for my complete recovery from
one of the severest afflictions that human flesh
is heir to. I feel as if the first days of my
childhood had returned.

Bowen, Queensland,
Sept 27th, 1889.
For twelve months or so I have been a great
sufferer from sciatica. There were persistent
sharp pains in the right side, so that I had to
drop exercise of every kind. I tried various
medicines, but the intense aching remained as
before or became even more violent. It
deprived me of rest and sleep, and I was at a
loss to know what would rid me of my
complaint. Finally I gave “Warner’s Safe
Rheumatic Cure” a trial, and found relief
from the first bottle, and when I had con-
sumed six bottles of the medicine with a few
vials of “Warner’s Safe Pills,” I was in
possession of my former robust health.

It is now twelve months since I experienced
a lowness of the nervous system, with an
apathy to physical exercise, and a sense of
intense fatigue after ordinary exertion. My
appetite failed, and I arose in the morning as
tired as when I retired at night. Suffering in
this manner for some time, when I heard of
“'Warner’s Safe Nervine” so well introduced
by your “Safe Cure.” I procured in all 3
bottles of “Warner’s Safe Nervine” which
braced up my system and benefited my health
thoroughly.

Hermit Park, Townsville, Queensland,
September 5, 1889.
Fourteen years ago, I had a severe attack of
rheumatic fever, accompanied by inflammation
of the joints. This dreadful complaint left
me in an enfeebled condition, and up to the
last twelve months I have been more or less
prone to attacks of acute rheumatism,
especially when exposed to Wet weather.
Last year, again, I had a most severe attack,
as usual ushered in with febrile disturbances,
followed by inflammation of the fibrous struc-
tures, the shoulder and hip. The affected
joints were swollen and acutely painful, more
so at night. My skin was hot and covered
with a sour, offensive sweat. My urine on
cooling left deep-coloured sediments of
urates, and my digestHg functions were
seriously impaired. When in this helpless
state one of your books was sent to me,
whereupon I resolved on a course of “ War-
ner’s Safe Rheumatic Cure,’’which I took alter-
nately with “ Warner’s Safe Cure,” also
taking the “ Safe ” PiHs as directed. I did
not feel any relief until I had consumed the
fourth bottle of the medicine, when a great
improvement became apparent. The pains
gradually lessened, the water became healthy,
and to he brief, with the use of 10 bottles of
“ Warner’s Safe Rheumatic Cure ” and
“ Safe Cure,” I was entirely freed of my old
enemy. I had no attack of rheumatics during
the last twelve months, and I am truly grate-
ful for my delivery from pain and disease.

Extract from Chronicle of Yarrawong (Vic.),
October 10th, ’B9.
Mr. Winder, who some time ago left Yarra-
wonga in very precarious health, suffering
from acute asthma, paid a visit to the district
last week looking quite robust and apparently
completely restored to health. Mr. Winder
left here to reside with his people, and, as he
fully expected, to die. On reaching his desti-
nation he grew rapidly worse and became
almost paralysed. He could neither sleep nor
use his arms, and his condition became so bad
that eating was an utter impossibility. At
this desperate stage he was advised to try
“ Warner’s Safe Asthmatic Cure.” He did
so, and from the very first moment of using
it he felt better, with the ultimate result that
he re-appears amongst us the picture of
health. It is not our desire to crack up
“ Warner<s patent medicines,” but a medi-
cine that can bring about such a radical and
speedy change as this deserves to be made
known, while if it is as efficacious as thi,s in-
stance would seem to abundantly assure us,
Mr. H. H. Warner deserves all the praise
that can be given him. When a doctor ac-
complishes a great result, we invariably sing
his praises, and why not do likewise in the
case of a maker and vendor of marvellous
patent medicines ?
Rockhampton, Queensland,
October Bth, 1889.
Some six years ago I was first subjected to a
most painful disease of the kidneys. I felt
agonising pains in the left side, as if a knife
was drawn in that part of the body, while
pains of an extremely severe nature extended
around the loins and down the thighs. The
urine regularly contained quite a mass of
urates, resembling red sand, and mictura-
tion was accompanied by the most dis-
tressing pains. My eyesight in time grew
dim, and my eyelids were as though they
were glued together. I was then under the
awful suspense of losing my sight. I was
ordered to the seaside, but returned from that
supposed shrine of health worse than ever. I
could not keep my food within me, and my
meals were followed by eructations. Hot
flannels were applied to relieve my pairs, but
to no purpose. Indigestion with its host of
distressing symptoms appeared in a more
severe shape. After being under the care of
the doctors for a month, in March last, my
chemists, Messrs. Row and Co., seeing the
condition I was in, advised me to take
“Warner’s Safe Cure.” Before taking the
“Safe” Cure I was afflicted with pains as
before mentioned at intervals of every half
hour. After consuming the first dose of the
“ Safe ” Cure it was 36 hours before any pain
recurred, and with the use of the first bottle
no pains were present. I have taken in all six
bottles of “ Safe Cure,” and there is not now
a trace of kidney disease, and my eyesight is
restored. This I may say is the first winter
I have passed painless since the last six
years.

Macdonaldtown, Sydney, N.S.W.,
November 26th, 1889.
It is perhaps 15 years since I first suffered
from nervous weakness and spasmodic closing
of the chest, so that I could not bear my
clothing on. My bosom used to swell and
evidently presaged more serious constitutional
disturbances, for some three or four years ago
I was first afflicted with asthma. The misery
I endured is patent only to those who are sub-
jected to this distressing complaint. During
the past two years or more there was hardly a
day when I was free from its visitations, and
when the attacks came on I sat in bed panting
for breath like one struggling for life, and at
night the agony was intense, so that I often
wished I was dead. There was also great
weakness and palpitation of the heart and
general ill-health. The doctor admitted be
was unable to cure me of my asthmatic affec-
tion. On reading of the merits of “Warner’s
Safe Asthma Cure ” I procured some and took
it nightly with wonderful success for three
months. To be brief, it has thoroughly cured
me of asthma. I have used five or six tins of
the medicine and have not experienced a re-
turn of the complaint since. At the same
time I have also used as directed 20 bottles of
“Warner’s Safe Cure,” with a few vials of
“Warner’s Safe Pills,” which gave strength
to the relaxed air vessels and improved my
health to an extent I never anticipated, as I
am advanced in years. It is with feeling of
gratitude that I testify to the high merits of
“Warner’s Safe Asthma Cure,” which I con-
sider the only known cure for asthmatic
patients.

WARNER’S SAFE PLASTERS,
Pain Believing and Strength Giving, are an old-fashioned combination of remedies, acting on truly scientific
principles. The ingredients, being freely taken up by the glands of the skin, produce immediate results. The effect
produced is secured by means of a continuous absorption, and act more powerfully than when the remedy is taken
internally in large quantities.
It is convenient, because there is not that repeated dosing with unpleasant and many times sickening drugs, and it does not
disturb the Stomach or Digestive Organs, or the course of nature in any respect. ° It V the best means of
, relief, as the remedy is carried directly to the diseased parts.

The Bard That Is To Be.
[ FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
’Tis strange that in a land so strong,
So strong and bold in mighty youth,
Wo have no poet’s voice of truth
To sing for us a wondrous song.
Our chiefest singer yet has sung
In wild, sweet notes a passing strain,
All carelessly and sadly flung
To that dull world he thought so vain.
“ I care for nothing, good nor bad,
My hopes are gone, my pleasures fled,
I am but sifting sand,” he said,
What wonder Gordon’s songs were sad !
And yet, not always sad and hard ;
In cheerful mood and light of heart
He told the tale of Britornarte,
And wrote the Rhyme of Joyous Guard.
And some have said that Nature’s face
To us is always sad ; but these
Have never felt the smiling grace
Of waving grass and forest trees
On sunlit plains as wide as seas.
* A land where dull Despair is king
O’er scentless flower and songless bird ! ”
But we have heard the bell-birds ring
Their silver bells at eventide,
Like fairies on the mountain side,
The sweetest note man ever heard.
The wild thrush lifts a note of mirth,
The bronzewing pigeons call and coo
Beside their nests the long day through ;
The magpie warbles clear and strong
A joyous, glad, thanksgiving song,
For all God’s mercies upon earth.
And many voices such as these
Are joyful sounds for those to tell,
Who know the Bush and love it well,
With all its hidden mysteries.
We cannot love the restless sea,
That rolls and tosses to and fro
Like some fierce creature in its glee;
For human weal or human woe
It has no touch of sympathy.
For us the bush is never sad,
Its myriad voices whisper low,
In tones the bushmen only know,
Its sympathy and welcome glad.
For us the roving breezes bring
From many a blossorn-tufted tree —•
Where wild bees murmur dreamily—
The honey-laden breath of Spring.
We have no tales of other days,
No bygone history to tell,
Our tales are told where camp-fires blaze
At midnight, when the solemn hush
Of that vast wonderland, the Bush,
Hath laid on every heart its spell.
Although we have no songs of strife,
Of bloodshed reddening the land,
We yet may find achievements grand
Within the bushman’s quiet life.
Lift ye your faces to the sky
Ye far blue mountains of the West,
Who lie so peacefully at rest
Enshrouded in a haze of blue ;
’Tis hard to feel that years went by
Before the pioneers broke through
Your rocky heights and walls of stone,
And made your secrets all their own.
For years the fertile Western plains
Were hid behind your sullen walls,
Your cliffs and crags and waterfalls
All weatherworn with tropic rains.
Between the mountains and the sea,
Like Israelites with staff in hand,
The people waited restlessly :
They looked towards the mountains old
And saw the sunsets come and go
With gorgeous golden afterglow,
That made the West a fairyland,
And marvelled what that West might be
Of which such wondrous tales were told.
For tales were told of inland seas
Like sullen oceans, salt and dead,
And sandy deserts, white and wan,
Where never trod the foot of man,
Nor bird went winging overhead,
Nor ever stirred a gracious breeze
To wake the silence with its breath
A land of loneliness and death.
At length the hardy pioneers
By rock and crag found out the way,
And woke with voices of to-day,
A silence kept for years and years.
Upon the Western slope they stood
And saw —a wide expanse of plain
As far as eye could stretch or see
Go rolling westward endlessly.
The native grasses, tall as grain,
Were waved and rippled in the breeze,
From boughs of blossom-laden trees
The parrots answered back again.
They saw the land tha*) it was good,
A land of fatness all untrod,
And gave their silent thanks to God.
The way is won ! The way is won !
And straightway from the barren coast
There came a westward-marching host.
That aye and eyer onward prest
With eager faces to the West,
Along the pathway of the sun.
The mountains saw them marching by :
They faced the all-consuming drought,
They would not rest in settled land :
But, taking each his life in hand,
Their faces ever westward bent
Beyond the farthest settlement,
Responding to the challenge cry
Of “better country further out.”
And lo a miracle ! the land
But yesterday was all unknown,
The wild man’s boomerang was thrown
Where now great busy cities stand.
It was not much, you say, that these
Should win their way where none withstood;
In sooth there was not much of blood
No war was fought between the seas.
It was not much ! but we who know
The strange capricious land they trod—
At times a stricken, parching sod,
At times with raging floods beset—
Through which they found their lonely way,
Are quite content that you should say
It was not much, while we can feel
That nothing in the ages old,
In song or story written yet
On Grecian urn or Roman arch,
Though it should ring with clash of steel,
Could braver histories unfold
Than this bush story, yet untold—
The story of their westward march.
But times are changed, and changes rung
From old to new—the olden days,
The old bush life and all its ways
Are passing from us all unsung.
The freedom, and the hopeful sense
Of toil that brought due recompense,
Of room for all, has passed away,
And lies forgotten with the dead.
Within our streets men cry for bread
In cities built but yesterday.
About us stretches wealth of land,
A boundless wealth of virgin soil
As yet unfruitful and untilled !
Our willing workmen, strong and skilled
Within our cities idle stand.
And cry aloud for leave to toil.
The stunted children come and go
In squalid lanes and alleys black ;
We follow but the beaten track
Of other nations, and we grow
In wealth for some—for many woe.
And it may be that we who live
In this new land apart, beyond
The hard old world grown fierce and fond
And bound by precedent and bond,
May read the riddle right and give
New hope to those who dimly see
That all tilings may be yet for good,
And teach the world at length to be
One vast united brotherhood.
So may it be, and he who sings
In accents hopeful, clear, and strong,
The glories which that future brings,
Shall sing, indeed, a wond’rous song.

CHRISTMAS PRESENTS!
For Good, Useful, Amusing or Instructive Christmas
Presents, we wish to draw attention to the following goods.
At this time of the year
Magic Lanterns
are always in great demand. Our Lanterns are always
good and serviceable, not mere toys, and this year really
cheaper than ever, as will be seen by the following prices.
Black Enamel (English pattern) Lanterns, with brass
mounts, three lenses, lamp with globe, 1 doz. set well-
coloured slides, in case complete:—
ď
Size No. 4 ... 18/ft
„ fi ... 2'./•
„ 0 ... 8<l/-
We have a very choice little outfit, in case, with lock
and key and everything complete, called
The “ CLIMAX,” price £2 10s.
This is made entirely of polished brass, and is a perfect
gem. The slides revolve instead of sliding, and include
with each Lantern such interesting subjects as Robinson
Crusoe, Red Riding Hood, Puss-in - Boots, Elephant’s
Revenge, celebrated men, &c. (eight pictures to each tale),
as well as comic, moving and rotating slides. The whole
forms one of the neatest, nicest, and most fascinating
presents that could be chosen.
Model Steam Engines.
Model Steam Boats.
In immense variety at extremely moderate prices. These
are excellent presents for the boys, as besides being always
amusing and entertaining they are also instructive. \Ve
have perfect working
Model Vertical Engines at ... 4/6 to £3 0
Model Steam Locomotives at 7/0 to 3 5
Model Steam Boats at ... 10/- to 215
All fitted with safety valve, so that there need be no fear
of explosion or railway Calamities.
Optimus (regd.) Watches, 18s. 6d. each.
These marvellous Watches are too well-known to need
much description here. We have dozens of them showing
in our windows, and have every confidence that those who
try them will fully endorse our statement that they are the
handsomest, cheapest and best timekeepers ever made.
Opera and Field Glasses.
We have some very special goods in these. For the
ladies, handsome and powerful glasses in oases (leather or
plush), combining at once the reticule or handkerchief
bag and the opera glass case —price, 30/- and 35/- We hav e
Opera Glasses at all prices, from 7/6. To those wishing to
make their gentlemen friends presents, we would strongly
recommend our new “ Randwick ” Field Glass (just im-
ported), the best we have ever had. Wonderfully power-
ful glasses in leather and nickel, and contained in a solid
buff leather case, with sling. In three sizes—40/-, 45/, 50/-
Phosographic Outfits.
What nicer present could be made to the boys than
these. By them, perfect, well-finished photos, can, with
very little trouble, be taken of everybody and everything,
and afford endless amusement to everyone. We have the
complete turnout for carte de visite pictures for £3, and
the same thing for cabinet pictures for £4 10s. Ours is
the best and cheapest place in Sydney for all kinds of
photographic goods.
Spectacles and Eye-Glasses
In silver and gold frames (in handsome oases), form highly
pleasing and acceptable presents to the old folks. We
have splendid Brazilian Peebles in
Silver Frames at 17/6 to 22/6 ;
Gold Frames at 25/-, 30/-, 35/- to 507-
Initials or names stamped in gold on cases without extra
charge.
Microscopes, Telescopes, Barometers,
Stereoscopes and Slides, &c.
We cannot mention here all the really beautiful goods
we have suitable for Christmas presents, but feel sure that
a visit to either of our shops will prove highly entertain-
ing, and enable all to invest their money in good, useful
things instead of wasting it in rubbish.

Wife a New Frock.
From the Wolverhampton Chronicle.
We have just learned of the thrilling experience of
the well-known cabman, Charles Green, who for
many years has been employed by the Wilson Cab
Company. His experience, as related below, is as
interesting as it is extraordinary. It appears that
Mr. Green had occasion recently to go out of town,
remaining overnight, and was obliged to sleep in a
damp bed, and thereby contracted rheumatism in
the most severe form. It seemed to settle all over
him ; he was brought home, put to bed, and for
more than eight weeks could not move hand or
foot. His agony was such that he would scream
if anyone came into the room for fear they would
touch him. His knees were swollen to three times
their natural size. He was as near crazy as man
could be, but at the same time retained his facul-
ties, Everything was tried without benefit. In
despair he was taken to the Wolverhampton Hos-
pital, where he remained four weeks, at the end of
which time he was even worse than when admitted,
and the medical gentlemen who attended him at
the hospital told him that they could do nothing
more for him, that his ease was hopeless, and he
was discharged as incurable. He was taken
home, where his wife persuaded him, as a last
resort, to try St. Jacobs oil, which was prooured
from Weaver, chemist, 42 Dudley-road, Green
remarking at the time, in a joking way, to his
wife, “ that if St. Jacobs oil cured him he would
buy her anew frock,” little expecting, however,
that he would have that pleasure. His wife then
had a double interest in curing her husband. She
applied half the contents of one bottle to his knees,
rubbing the part vigorously for half-an-hour, when
she left the room for a few minutes. On returning
she was surprised to hear Green say, “I shall have
to buy you anew frock, for I can turn myself and
move my legs. ” Continuing to use this famous
oil, Green commenced to improve, and after using
the contents of four bottles, he was out and on his
cab at work in all weathers, and as well and hearty
as ever he was in his life. He was laid up four
months altogether, perfectly helpless, could not
move hand or foot. This was such an extraordinary
and almost unheard-of cure, we determined to
ascertain, if possible, what sort of thing this St.
Jocobs oil really was. We, therefore, called upon
Mr. Weaver, the chemist above referred to, who
stated at once that he knew of Green’s case, and
personally vouched for the above statement, and
stated further that, while Green’s cure was
perhaps the most remarkable, he knew of numerous
other extraordinary cases which had come under
his immediate attention where St. Jacobs oil had
cured people of rheumatism and neuralgia after
every other means had been resorted to without
avail. Mr. Weaver said the sales of St. Jacobs
oil were enormous ; people invariably speak in the
highest terms of its power to conquer pain.
ESSENTIALS TO SUCCESS.
Successful men are often quoted as instances of
rare good luck. Those laggards in life’s race who
point them out thus markedly failed to consider
their real essentials. Shrewdly observant thought,
keen ability, and foresight coupled with judgment,
care, and untiring industry, can alone ensure suc-
cess. This is not an age of sham. It is eminently
practical. To win popular appreciation an article
must possess intrinsic worth. Thus it has been
with the Waterbury Watch. It has won its way
to public esteem because it is a good timekeeper.
But that alone would not have accomplished its
widespread popularity so quickly. It has been
judiciously and continuously put before the pub-
lic, and the public in turn desire and will have it.
The success of the past demonstrates its reliability
and general appreciation.
WELL PLEASED.
Under date November 4,1889, Mr. G. Ambrose
writes from Goree Station, Narrandera, as fol-
lows : “lam well pleased with my Waterbury
Watch. It certainly keeps excellent time.”
AN AUSTRALIAN BUSHMAN’S OPINION.
“ Gentlemen, — I have had one of your watches
three years now, and I would warrant it to keep
time with the best watch in the country, I have
travelled the country with it, journeys of 400
miles and more, and have never once found it to
fail me. —I am, &c., yours respectfully,
JOHN M‘GARTHY.

April, 1889.”

A Skin Without Blemish
Everywhere a network of sudorific rfucte, veins,
and pores, the skin constantly renews itself, and
not only with its ceaseless desquamation, but with
its natural functional action, eliminates all waste,
accumulation and disease. Hence, a skin without
i blemish means more than beauty; it means health.

it, externally, and Cuticura Resolvent, the new
'blood purifier, internally, cure every species of tor-
turing, disfiguring, itching, scaly and pimply
diseases of the skin, scalp and blood, with loss
of hair, from pimples to scrofula.
il have been afflicted for a great many years with
bad blood, which has caused me to have sores on
my body. My hands were in a solid sore for over
a year. I had tried almost everything I could hear
of, but had given up all hopes of ever being cured,
when I saw the advertisement of the Cuticura
Remedies. I used one box of Cuticura, one
bottle of Resolvent, and one cake of Soap, and
am now able to do all my own work.

HOT WEATHER
To counteract the enervating, relaxing, and eyi
effects of the heat and depressing nature of the
climate in this country during the summer months
no remedy has ever appeared before the public to
■qua! or even that would bear comparison witli
Clem®aits’
it prevents fever, malaria and ague, keeps _ up
the appetite, assists digestion and assimilation,
stimulates the stomach, liver, kidneys, and bowels ;
thus preventing liver and kidney disease, and
ward ing off their unpleasant symptoms, as head-
ache, constipation, piles, gout, rheumatism, dropsy,
apoplexy, &c. The summer is the time when
Clements’ Tonic is the medecine par excellence
for the people. It prevents the relaxation and
depression so prevalent in the hot weather in
these latitudes ; it enriches the blood, aids
perspiration, and restores all lost nerve-power;
is the only reliable anti-febrifuge and pick-me-up
prepared in the colonies, and can be depended
upon to do f/ood and cure disease. The action of
Clements’ Tonic is certain, sure, and prompt;
relief is felt immediately after taking the first
dose; it acts direct on the seat of disease and
lures the cause, and then the effects of that cause
oease. Most other remedies offered are prepared
with a view, of treating the symptoms, con-
sequently, as soon as the effect of the medicine
passes away the trouble returns, and the patient
wants another bott'e of medicine. This may be
very good for the maker of the remedy (?) hut it is
not at all satisfactory to the patient. Clements’
Tonic positively, effectually, and permanently
cures ; it does not only relieve, like most of the
narcotic mixtures sold, hut radically effects a cure ;
and if the pathafft only avoids the source, from
which he or she contracted the illness in the
first place, a relapse is impossible. Moreover,
Clements’ Tonic does not constrrnge the gastric
vessels of the stomach or cause indigestion, and
will not injure nor discolour the teeth. We shall be
glad to enter into particulars with any corres-
pondents who like to address us at Newtown.

CLEMENTS’ TONIC,
and gracefully acknowledges the benefit

Great Advantage. It is very Stimulating, and a

“ Thought his case beyond the Power of
Medicine.”
Kangaroo Valley, N.S.W., April 3, ’B9.
Dear Sir,—l have very much pleasure in bearing witness
to the great value of 'Clements’ Tonic in cases of
LASSITUDE, NERVOUSNESS AND CONSTITUTIONAL
DEBILITY GENERALLY. For more than 12- months I
was a martyr to extreme lassitude, loss of appetite, sleep-
lessness, and then 1 concomitant train of physical troubles,
so much so that I feared I should have to abandon my
profession as a journalist, writing being particularly
irksome and laborious to me. I tried several advertised
tonics (?) with little or no good result, and began to think
my case beyond the power of medicine to cure. However,
seeing your Tonic advertised in some of my Exchanges,
I concluded to try it as a “ dernier resort;” and 1 am
pleased to say the result was most satisfactory. After
taking one bottle I found my appetite much improved ; 1
could sleep more soundly, and felt refreshed next morn-
ing. I continued the medicine, taking in all six large
bottles, and gradually all my distressing symptoms dis-
appeared. I now feel myself stronger than ever, and as
near perfect health as a man who has to bear the strain of
constant literary work can expect to be. I can confidently
recommend Clements’ Tonic to all persons suffering
from loss of nerve force through sickness or mental over-
work, and am most happy to support my testimony with
my signature.—And remain, dear Sir, Yours faithfully,
P. JEFFERSON WALLACE,
Editor and Proprietor “ Kangaroo Valley Pioneer.”
Gave him new Health and Strength.”
75 King Street, Sydney, March 19, ’B9.
Dear Sir, —Kindly send me two more bottles of
Clements’ Tonic and permit me to express my thanks
and gratitude at the results obtained by taking two large
bottles. I bad had a great amount of business worry to
contend against, which, together with the long hours I had
stuck to if. completely undermined my constitution, and
made me feel very fired, weak and ill, my nerves being
~u i te shattered. I was so nervous that the accidental
slamming of a floor.would cause me to start violently, _my
heart would heat very rapidly, and 1 would break out in a
profuse perspiration, afterwards having a sensation of
extreme weakness, lasting for some hours ; my sleep at
night Ivas disturbed ; 1 awoke in the morning with head-
ache and aching limbs, and quite unrefreshed. I had no
appetite, no strength, and no inclination to work, and was
completely run-out. 1 was persuaded by your advertise-
ments to try Clements’ Tonic, and am a different man
ever since f it gave me new health and strength, increased
niv appetite, and made me relish my food ; I increased in
flesh I lost all nervous feelings, and now feel stronger
lhan’ever, and am glad to bear test mony to the value of
your wonderful remedy. Yours,.&c., IV. D. BRAHAM.
When influential men like these allow their names to
appear in endorsement of a medicine, it proves, beyond all
question, the bona ,tides of that, preparation, if you are
still sceptical you can write to all or any and they will
answer yon : No other medicine can show such proof
although there are scores of counterfeits on the market ,
it rests with the public to guard itself against imposture.
Only meritorious articles are imitated and pirated, that is
why so many substitutes for Clement’s Tonic are on
sale. Such imitation is the greatest proof of the reliabilit y
of Clements’ Tonic.

Dr. Speer is a regular Graduated Physician, educated at
Harvard College, U.S. (for confirmation see New Zealand
Gazette, January 21st, 1886; also New South Wales
Gazette, April 17th, 1888). The doctor has devoted 14
years to the study of CHRONIC, NERVOUS, AND
SPECIAL DISEASES. Four of these were in the leading
hospitals of the United States, which enables him to treat
all complaints with excellent results. All applying to
him will receive his honest opinion of their complaints.
No experimenting ;no Mercury used. He will guarantee
a positive cure in every case he undertakes, or forfeit
£2OO. His reason for doing so is this —when there is not
organic disease, and nothing but an inorganic trouble, or,
in other words, a conglomeration of symptoms producing
a certain result, there is no reason why.it cannot be re-
moved with the proper remedies, therefore he guarantees.
He wishes it distinctly understood that he does not claim
to perform impossibilities, or to have miraculous power
he claims only to be a skilled and successful physician
thoroughly informed in his speciality—CHßONlC and
SPECIAL DISEASES op MEN and WOMEN. People
residing at a distance can, by explaining their troubles in
detail be treated at home. The course of treatment will
not in any way interfere wit h their business. Examina-
tion, and advice free to all. Charges moderate. H. J.

This eminent Specialist, Founder, and Chief
Surgeon of the long-established and favourably-
known Dispensary that now bears his name, re-
ceived his medical education in the leading colleges
and hospitals of Europe. He has devoted a life-
time to the study of
PRIVATE, NERVOUS, AND SKIN
DISEASES.
He has by profound research thoroughly investi-
gated their origin, traced their deadly sources and
insidious dissemination, and ascertained the surest
and safest methods by which they may he eradi
cated, with these widely recognised qualifications
combined with unswerving faithfulness to hi s
patients, he has during his practice, extending
over FORTY YEARS, attained a well-deserved
pre-eminence in their treatment. His practice
embraces diseases which probably cause more un-
happiness than any other class of troubles that
afflict mankind.

gressions or excesses of more nature age, bladder
difficulties, a whitish or dark ropy sediment in

book will prove a valuable companion, and even
though you be perfectly well its general inform-
tion and prescription may assist you in restoring
some poor friend to health even after his case has
been pronounced incurable by his medical at-
tendant.
ONE POUND IS SUFFICIENT TO
SEND
for Remedies necessary for the cure of NER-
VOUS DEBILITY. Should you require medical
treatment, as procrastination is sometimes dan-
gerous, it would be advisable for you to sit down
quietly in your chamber and write to the doctor,
detailing every experienced symptom. He will
on receipt of such a let Icq write you, promptly
and courteously, a candid and straightforward
oponion of your case. If you do not think you
understand the case, send for his famous medical
work, the price of which is but sixpence ; enclosed
in the volume will bo found a list of carefully-pro-
pared questions, which will, in all probability,
assist you materially in describing your ailment.
Dr. Richards uses nothing but the purest remedies,
and never prescribes mercury under any circum-
stances. The moment letters are carefully per-
used and answered they are destroyed by Are,
and patients may rest assured that their cases
will remain a secret between the doctor and
themselves. Dr. Richards has successfully treated
nearly 25,000 cases since coming to Australia, and
has permission from at least 10,000 persons to
show their written evidence of his success. All

OUR NEW SHOW-ROOMS AND WAREHOUSES:
483 & 484 GEORGE STREET, SYDNEY.
Something New in Sewing Machines !
THE BEALE PATENT MACHINE.
What is there Special about it?
The restless march of invention has enabled ua
to bring before the public improvements of im-
mense value, to some short account of which Ave
beg your attention for a few moments. Our call-
ing is to relieve the home-mother of all that may
Aveary her in sewing, and to make the same
throughout a pleasure. That we have during the
last ten years succeeded in so doing, scores of
thousands will testify. And to-day we are supply-
ing a machine Avhose range of work is absolutely
complete, transcending the hopes and dreams of
years. The construction and form are such as to
place it altogether above and beyond competition,
and for the truth of Avhich assertions, as of the
following, Ave humbly request that your own eyes
may be the judges.
THE IMPROVED HIGH ARM. A great
desideratum with ladies has been the raising of the
arm of the machine, so as to allow the goods to be
seAvn to pass freely underneath. This had to be
accomplished Avithout increasing the weight of the
machine. In fact, the Beale runs with wonderful
ease and rapidity. It is almost silent, all clicking
sounds having been obviated. As is Avell-knoAvn,
a good test of the finish of any mechanism is its
silence Avhen in rapid motion.
ALARGER RANGE OE APPLIANCES is
provided than Avith any other machine. Samples
of work performed upon these we are prepared at
all times to submit, Avhilst an elaborate Instruction
Book is supplied, which is alone _ sufficient to
explain their uses and their applicability to every
requirement.
NICKEL-PLATING.—In our climate the
exposed parts of the machine, and the appliances,
need to be protected from rust. We have, at
considerable expense, added a handsomely nickeled
wheel, nickeled plates, screws, appliances, treadle-
bar and cones, heightening the appearance. These
improvements also tend largely to preserve the
parts. This plating- is imperishable.
A MUCH LARGER DRAWER has taken the
place of the cramped and clumsy contrivance of
former years. When closed it securely fastens the
cover, and is provided Avith a lock and key.
THE WOODWORK is handsomer than ever,
being always of selected and inlaid Walnut. All
of it has been exposed for Aveeks in the drying-
room of the Eactory to a temperature reaching as
high as 170 degrees ; thus when kept out of damp
and sunshine, it will endure our most trying
climates. _
A SELF-THREADING SHUTTLE of solid
steel, saving the trouble of threading by the end
of the cotton. It has an excellent tension, is
strong and simple.
THE BOBIN WINDER is a marvel of in-
genuity, Avinding and guiding the cotton by itself,
as evenly as upon the real whence it came, and
stopping of its OAvn accord when the bobin is full.
The baby’s tiny clothing, upon which mothers love to
display their choicest handiwork; the boy’s tweed suit,
the drawing-room carpet, may all be stitched by the won-
derful BEALE Machine. Examples of all kinds of sewing
required in dresses, millinery, underclothing, tailoring and
upholstery will be shown and explained at our offices free
of charge. , . , ~ . , ,
With the Avonderful BEALE Machine, whether for hand
or foot use, you can hem any Avidth, make double seams
o- (ells, braid, stitch Avith chenille, Berlin wool or gold
cord, and such like for fancy work; you may make a
pretty lace stitch, tuck ever so finely, bind dresses, coats,
or carpets ; sew on trimmings Avithout guiding, make
frilling, ruffling, or niching ; quilt, weave your own braid
Avith any combination of colours, and stitch it on at the
same time; make thick Avoollen door mats, embroidered
antimacassars, window curtains, and so forth; you can
easily and rapidly perform the fashionable shirring or
gathering so popular for sleeves, bodies, or skirts of dresses
with an appliance supplied gratis ; lay the small cords in
hoods and stays; do large cording; gather Avith or without
a band, and generally do all kinds of straight sewing upon
n v material AA r hatever. You can darn upon any woven
goods, and do creAvel work. You may make button and
eyelet holes, do overcasting, make herring-bone stitch
upon any materials. This Avork is absolutely unique, and
can only be accomplished upon the BEALE Patent
Machine. ~, , , . .
Any of these performances avill be shown at our shops
at any time. The BEALE Patent makes a lock-stitch
which cannot ravel, yet by a momentary alteration the
seAving can be done so as to rip from end to end if desired.
This peculiarity is sometimes useful Avhen children’s clothes
are intended to be altered.
We h ave a special AA r ord for husbands: When the day s
business is over, and the evening meal is finished, the
perhaps the sister or daughter—sits down to her
seAving With her hands alone she cannot, as aforesaid,
do anything like the Avhole of the Avork required. In a
corner of the room is perhaps an old-fashioned machine,
with Avhich she may, by hard driving, occasionally stitch,
Avith a noise like a sausage-machine, a simple straight
seam ; but that is no great help. She ought to be able to
do \LL the work with it, short of stitching on buttons,
which is a trifle. And Ave have known some instances
AA-here the lady of the house is anxious to obtain a first-
class machine, that which will be the greatest of all helps
to her but the husband demurs on the score of expense.
Why, it is the only article of the household furnishing
which will ever return you any part of the cost! If the
lady will use it, it MUST earn far more than the half-a-
orown a Aveek necessary to purchase it. On one little
varment she will save that sum, so that in addition to in-
creased comfort your household expenses will not be en-
larged but ought to be diminished, by the possession of a
BEALE PATENT MACHINE. Hoav often do Ave Avaste
money upon really useless knick-knacks, or upon need-
lessly expensive articles and indulgences . The Machine
should far more than pay for itself during: the time you
are clearing it off, and it will then become your OAvn, earn-
ing or saving money as before. Is it not fairly to he
called a PROFITABLE INVESTMENT?

A MEDICINE.
Beecham’s Pills
Are universally admitted
to be worth a Guinea
a Box for bilious
and nervous disorders,
such as wind and pain in
the stomach, sick head-
ache, giddiness, fulness
and swelling after meals,
dizziness, and drowsiness,
cold chills, flushings'of
heat, loss of appetite,
shortness of breath, cos-
tiveness, scurvy, blotches
on the skin, disturbed
sleep, frightful dreams,
and all nervous and trem-
bling sensations,_ &c. The
first dose will give relief
in twenty minutes. Every
sufferer is earnestly invited to try one box of these
Bills, and they will be acknowledged to be
Worth a Guinea a Box.
For females of all ages these Pills are invaluable,
as a few doses of them carry olf all humors, and
bring about all that is required. No female should
he without them. There is no medicine to be found
equal to BEECHAM’S PILLS for removing any
obstruction or irregularity of the system. If taken ac-
cording to the directions given with each box they will
soon restore females of all ages to sound and robust
health. This has been proved by thousands who have
tried them, and found the benefits which are ensured by
their use.
For a weak stomach, impaired digestion and all disorders
of the liver, they act like “ MAGIC,” and a few doses will
be found to work wonders upon the most important
organs in the human machine. They strengthen the
whole muscular system, restore the long-lost complexion,
bring back the keen edge of appetite, and arouse into ac-
tion with the ROSEBUD of health the whole physical
energy of the human frame. These are “FACTS” testified
continually by members of all classes of society ; and
one of the best guarantees to the nervous and debilitated
is, Beecham’s Pills have the largest sale of any patent
medicine in the world.
Beecham’s Magic Cough Pills.
As a remedy for Coughs in general. Asthma, Bronchial
Affections, Hoarseness, Shortness of Breath, Tightness
and Oppression of the Chest, Wheezing, &c., these Pills
stand unrivalled. They are the best ever offered to the
public and will speedily remove that sense of oppression
and difficulty of breathing which nightly deprive the
patient of rest. Let any person give Beecham’s Cough
Pills a trial and the most violent Cough will in a
short time be removed.
Prepared only and sold wholesale and retail by the pro-
prietor, Thomas Beeoham, Chemist, St. Helens, Lancashire,
