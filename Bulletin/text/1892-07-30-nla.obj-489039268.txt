THE GREATER PORTION OF THE NEW SOUTH WALES PUBLIC IS AWARE, DR. KELLY
IS A LEGALLY QUALIFIED AND REGISTERED PHYSICIAN, AND HAS BY PAR THE
LARGEST PRACTICE IN THE COLONIES. MANY PERSONS AT A DISTANCE, HOWEVER,
ARE UNAWARE OP HIS GREAT SUCCESS, AS, HITHERTO, HE HAS REFRAINED FROM
ADVERTISING. HENCE, TO WIDEN THE SPHERE OF HIS USEFULNESS, HE HAS
DETERMINED, BY MEANS OP ADVERTISING, TO MAKE HIMSELF KNOWN IN REMOTE
DISTRICTS WHERE. HIS REPUTATION MAY NOT YET HAVE TRAVELLED. AS THE
QUESTION MAY ARISE, WHY DOES SO EMINENT A PHYSICIAN AS DR. KELLY FIND
IT NECESSARY TO ADVERTISE, HE MAY REPLY TO ONE AND ALL AS FOLLOWS

SHOW THEM CLEARLY
HOW TO CURE THE DISEASE WITHOUT
THE ASSISTANCE OF PHYSICIAN OR CHEMIST.
MANY PERSONS WONDER WHY THEIR MEMORY IS NOT SO RETENTIVE, AND THEIR
GENERAL INTELLECT NOT SO CLEAR AND STRONG AS THEY FORMERLY WERE.
DR. KELLY’S BOOK WILL EXPLAIN THE CAUSE IN PLAIN AND SIMPLE LANGUAGE.
THEREFORE, EVEN THOUGH YOU BE FREE FROM DISEASE, SEND FOR THIS GREAT

“THE BULLETIN.”
(Published at SYDNEY, N.S.W.)
The Unique Weekly—Australia's Nonpareil
Illustrated Newspaper,
“The Bulletin,”
Premier Australian Literary journal.
Is the only paper which has a consistent and dis
tinctive Australian National Policy.
The Bulletin favours—
A Republican Form of Government.
One Person, one Vote.
Complete Secularisation and Freedom of State
Education.
Reform of the Criminal Code and Prison
System.
A United Australia and Protection against
the World.
Australia for the Australians.—The cheap
Chinaman, the cheap nigger, and the
cheap European pauper to be absolutely
excluded.
A State Bank, the issue of bank-notes to be a
State monopoly.
The direct election of Ministers by Parlia-
ment, instead of Party Government or
rather Government by Contradiction.
A new Parliamentary System-one House to
be elected by constituencies as at present;
the other to be chosen by the whole
country voting as one Constituency.
A Universal System of Compulsory Life
Insurance,
The entire Abolition of the Private Owner-
ship of Land.
The Referendum.
The Abolition of Titles of so-called “nobility.”
The public eye rejects as uninteresting more
than half of what appears in the newspapers of
the day. It is only the remainder that is found
in The Bulletin.
The Bulletin is an aggressive Democratic
paper which strives to exclude from its artisti-
cally-condensed columns all matter which is nob
of general human interest. The Bulletin was
started eleven years ago with no capital but brains,
?r.d has become a vast property, because it pos-
sesses a vitality lacked by the countless news-
paper-ventures in which Australian capitalists
have unavailingly spent large fortunes.
The Bulletin’s conductors claim thab every
progressive paper on the Australian continent has
more or less endeavoured to profit by its example
and follow its lines. The result of its powerful
influence and its unprecedented literary and com-
mercial success can at once be seen by comparing
the methods pursued by the Australian daily and
weekly press prior to and immediately after the
first issue of The Bulletin.
From the date of The Bulletin's inaugural
publication its success was assured. It had at
once a dozen more or less servile imitators, many
of which even took, so far as was possible, its
name. They are now all dead, while The Bul-
letin continues the one phenomenal success in
Australian journalism, the one completely non-
local and distinctly universal Australasian news-
paper.
The Bulletin proprietary have spent some
thousands of pounds in fitting their buildings
with the latest appliances for high-class printing
and the production of illustrations, and they have
now issued The Bulletin in an entirely new
form—printed with new type of improved legi-
bility on the finest paper, and adorned with
sketches from the hands of the ablest and best-
paid newspaper artists Australia has ever seen.
The Bulletin is the only well-established A us-
tralian journal which, throughout its career, has
been consistently Radical, it points with pride
to the fact that for years it stood alone among
secular newspapers in advocating the Irish
National Cause, and that it was the only Aus-
tralian journal which denounced the Soudan
Expedition from its inception.
The Bulletin is the beacon-fire of national
progress: it is the forceful summons to the
crusade against the monopolies in land, wealth,
power, and privilege—the direct cause of half the
misery which now afflicts British humanity.
Against the claims of avaricious clergy who claim
to monopolise salvation, against the dark despotism
of grasping plutocrats, and against the exercise of
any human authority which has not been granted
by the people over whom it is exercised, The
Bulletin will fearlessly and ruthlessly contend.
The Bulletin, unlike the ordinary weekly
journal, is not loaded with a weight of matter
transferred from the columns of a daily paper
issued from the same office. The Bulletin is
not connected with any other paper, and the
matter it contains is all specially prepared by its
own unequalled staff.
The Bulletin is the journal which, of all Aus-
tralian journals, is most frequently quoted in Eng-
land, America, and the colonies. •
The Bulletin, which is the only paper sold
by runners in the streets of every Australasian
capital, is the most widely-circulated of all papers
published south of the equator, and is the only
Australasian publication which enjoys a popu-
larity unhampered by the political boundaries
that so closely restrict other journals to the
colonies in which they are printed.
The Bulletin’s red cover is equally familiar
to the bushraan of the Far North, the stockman
of Central Australia, the pearl-sheller of Torres
Straits, and the digger in the Madriland
Ranges. A paper which is at once the most
popular city publication and the organ of the
intelligent bushman must indeed be broadly based.
Perhaps the strongest proof of The Bulletin’s
popularity is found in the unchallengeable fact—
easily ascertainable from any postal official—that,
of all journals issued in Australasia, The Bul-
letin is the one most frequently remailed from
one reader to another.
The Bulletin is going ahead faster than any
other paper, because its vast mass of original and
specially-written reading matter is the brightest
and best, its illustrations the cleverest and most
artistic, and its policy the boldest and most
straightforward ever submitted to the Australian
public.

SATURDAY, JULY 30, 1892.
“I, Dibbs, am a Republican.”
It is unwise to trust any politician until he
is dead, and unless he has been dead a very
long time it is unwise to trust him even then.
He who puts his faitli in a live politician is
almost always “ left,” and he who puts his
faith in anybody else is generally “left”
also. Premier Dibbs, of New South Wales,
is the latest evidence of the truth of this
axiom A few days ago he was a unique
figure in Australian politics. , lie was an
honest man, inasmuch as no one had ever
found him using his high position for any
underhand private purpose, and every man
is honest until he is found out—also a good
many are honest even after they are found
out. He had never run a bogus bank or a
swindling insurance-company, nor had he
obtained an overdraft by any means which
wouldn’t bear inspection, nor cut up any
estate into small allotments and sold them
under shady circumstances. He was the
first avowedly republican -Premier who ever
held office in Australia, and ho looked like
the one republican who would be true to his
faith unto the end, and never sell himself for
a handful of silver or a scrap of ribbon to
put in his coat. Such shoddy creatures as
Robert Stout might preach democracy for
years and then grab at the first cheap title
that came along, like a dog snatching at a
raw chop, but the general impression was
that Dibbs had a genuine contempt for the
little, mean, tinpot distinctions which Vic-
toria throws to “ loyal at three a
penny. But all this is past, and ano'.hor
idol is broken-down on the highway.
Dibbs is now only a K.C.M.G., aim g
with the King of Siam, and the dingy poten-
tate of Zanzibar, and a certain dirty native
dignitary at Dongola, and a mysterious yellow
man in Eastern Asia whose full name is too
long for publication ; and he has only escaped
being a brother-dignitary to the King of the
Cannibal Islands through the timely decease
of that fish-smelling potentate who lately
went to sleep with his fathers at Honolulu,
and thus left a vacancy in the order of St.
Michael and St. George.
It is probably safe to assume that Dibits is
a republican no longer. Whether he over
was one, or whether he over imagined he was
one arc matters which only the new
K.C. M.G. can decide. Possibly he doesn’t
know himself. But the essence of republi-
canism is equality f and the man who pines
after, or accepts under whatever pressure,
decorations granted by Queen Victoria,
is . virtually pledged to prop up the im-
perial connection —partly out of gratitude
for the title lie has already got, and partly
for the sake of those which ho may get in
the future. The process by which Hires
sold himself was the same by which almost
every prominent Australian who visits Eng-
land is sold sooner or later. He was bought
with flattery and champagne, and the visions
of bare-backed females in fashionable draw-
ing-rooms, and the glare of gas-lights, and
the dance at aristocrat iQ. balls, and by largo,
greasy dinners, and conversations with
royalty, and other matters of the same des-
cription. And as the end of all these things
lie has received, as his price, an alleged
honour which sits upon him as gracefully as
a tall hat oh a naked-ttbertginai. '•
• • •
4 So far as we are aware no Australian has
ever yet gone to England and returned with-
out a title except the one who couldn’t get a
title, or who was offered one which he con-
sidered too humble for acceptance. Also, so
far as our knowledge goes, no Australian has
ever yet failed to go to England in search of
a title, save the one who couldn’t raise the
funds for the journey by overdraft at a
bogus bank or otherwise, or who had no
hope of getting anything for his pains,
or who had his title sent out to him and
therefore didn’t require to go. The re-
publican party consists of the great mass
which has no earthly hope of ever becoming
a K.C.M.G., just as the Land Nationalisation
party consists of the huge majority which
hasn't even a quarter of an acre o£ land to
nationalise, and the preachers of religious
equality always represent those churches
which arc too small and feeble to have any
chance to get on top. A nd, therefore, the
hope of republicanism lies chiefly in the
fact that no monarch is likely to raise the
whole of the Australian population to the
Order of St. Michael and St. George, and
if he did so the “ distinction ” would lose its
value, and all the K.C.M.G.s would pre-
sently become republicans for .want of any-
body underneath to envy them. And, at
the same time, the groaQfcar of republican-
ism lies in the fact that the; party never has
a reliable leader, for-whenever a leader
grows sufficiently strong to be worth buying, ho
is shoved along to market by his womankind
and purchased with a remnant of ribbon for
his. chest, and a splash of ink to put in front
of his ignoble cognomen. Up to date the
same poor, mean little “ honour ” has bought
them all--save and except only poor old Joe
Bosisto, of eucalyptus oil fame, with his
name blown in the bottle as a guarantee
against fraudulent imitations, who became
only a small, cheap C.M.G., and then
vanished out of public life, and took his three
commonplace letters with him into obscurity.
* * *
In all probability, however, Premier Dibbs
will be, for a time at least, a greater success
with his title than he was without it. The
dual-vote crowd will look more favourably
upon him than they used to do, and the
public-house interest—that is to say, the large
public-house which has-no mortgage upon it
—will be more friendly towards him, and
the “loyal” remnant which still survives in
the land will reverence him because of his
associations with royalty, and society, as
represented by the unclothed person at the
theatre, will view him in an altogether new
light, and Sydney Burdekin will either
reverence him because he has got a title or
will gnash his teeth upon him because he
didn’t get one himself—-no one can tell
which. Therefore, Dibbs will probably hold
office longer than he might otherwise have
donjb, and draw more salary, and be a bigger
feature at social functions where cheap sherry
and sandwiches predominate, and be alto-
gether a larger and more imposing mediocrity
than he otherwise would have been. But he
will never be anything but a large mediocrity
to the end of his days. He has fallen, amid
the secret laughter of the Colonial Office pimps,
into that dreary groove which leads to “loyal-
ism,” and much whooping about the National
Anthem, and much grovel about the “ be-
loved Queen.” There are many varieties of
social distinction,.but they all lead to con-
servatism and grovel in the end. The
woman who owns the green silk dress in a
bush township where no one else owns a
silk dress of any kind is always a conserva-
tive and an upholder of the established order
of things.' So is the woman who shakes
hands frequently with the mayoress, and the
back-blocks publican who was patronised
once by the Governor when he passed
through the district, and the tenor in the
choir, and the person who once saw the
Prince of Wales, and the individual who
owns a piano in a region where these instru-
ments a e scarce. Premier Dibbs, by virtue
of his new title, is now on a par with all
t hese, and the effect in his case will be the
same.
# # #
“The smallest distinctions thankfully re-
ceived ” is the notice that is hung on the
soul of almost every Australian politician,
and of almost every other politician, and of
almost everybody else, whether he is a poli-
tician or not. Even the New South Wales
Labour - party has become comparatively
tame since its members got admission
to Government House, and Softhat, the
Labour M.P., is hardly the firebrand
he used to he since he has risen to he
a member of Tatters all’s at a subscrip-
tion of three guineas per annum. Probably
Premier Dibbs was as good a republican as
the average, in which case it is a dreary out-
look for republicanism ; possibly he was a
little worse than the average, in which case
it is a solemn lookout for himself and his
own soul. 'lt may be that there were twelve
Iscariots am ong the apostles—there generally
are, in fact —-only the other eleven were left
in the rush for the cash, and, if so, the world
has wasted over eighteen centuries of useless
vituperation. But Dibbs’ apostacy is aggra-
vated by the fact that ho looked more
honest than the average more honest
than a great many honest men can
afford to look. The country was not
surprised when Dalley accepted a title,
for Dalley was in many respects a politi-
cal fossil, whose opinions were those of
the dark ages, and his one axiom was
that Australia should'be prepared to sacrifice
its last coin and its- last -man, if need be, for
the sake of the Gdelbhs and their relations.
Neither was it surprised at Griffith, for
Griffith was a transparent sham ; nor at
M‘ll wraith, who was a corpulent money-
grubber and a man who hungered after
greasy dinners and corner allotments, nor at
almost any other of the shoddy knights who
make themselves ridiculous in the land.
But Dibbs, the avowed republican, had
further to fall than any of them, and he slid
down with the ease of a man who was accus-
tomed to the work. As a republican he
desired to abolish royalty, and having
accepted what he evidently regards as a
favour from that institution, The Bulletin
presumes that in common gratitude he
doesn’t want to abolish it any longer. At
all events, it devoutly hopes that such is
the case, and that Dibbs is done with
republicanism. For if he still retains
his former professions he may, by some
misfortune, get a chance to go back on
them a second time for another title, and
he may do it at a time when his falling away
will be a more serious disaster. In accept-
ing his mean little decoration he has already
been an apostate to his old faith. If he again
advocates republicanism he will be an
apostate to his new faith, which is the afore-
said decoration. And if by so doing he gets
a chance, as he possibly may, to quit his
original creed once more for another gewgaw
he will have apostatised for the third time.
The man who gets a chance to apostatise
three times is a public calamity. For the
time being Dibbs has become an Imperialist,
and this paper devoutly trusts that he will
stay there.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
A New Loan.
The New South Wales Government has floated
locally a new loan of £500,000, at par, the
interest being 44 per cent. The money is to be
expended on public works, the material for
which will be manufactured in the province—
except where contracts made by the Parkes
Ministry block the way —therefore the principal
■and interest will both remain in the com try.
The interest is just one half per cent above the
average rate paid for British capital in the old
Foreign-trade days, when New South Wales
had a cheap, imported Premier, and used to
import cheap British capital, and spend it in
buying imported steel rails and imported rolling-
stock, and the constantly accumulating load of
debt assisted no local industry, and furnished
no employment save to the men who got a tem-
porary job at shovelling dirt on the new
lines, and laying down the imported rails, and
securing them with imported bolts, under the
supervision of imported officials. The half-
million which has been borrowed in the pro-
vince will presently go back into circulation
along with the interest, and —if the New South
Wales Government must still continue its bor-
rowing policy—there is no earthly reason why
it should not be borrowed and expended on
public works over and over again without any
end or visible limit. So long as there is
£500,000 of available cash in N.S. \V.,and so long
as the Government remains true to its Protec-
tionist principles by spending its funds within the
province only, there is absolutely no reason why
the State shouldn’t be able to borrow a hundred
millions if it wants tooutof that onelittle amount.
The theory that the Australian Governments
must raise money in England because Australia
has not the money to lend is utterly illogical.
If there is even £lOO,OOO available in the country,
and the State borrows it, and expends it locally,
and pays the interest to local bondholders, it
can keep on borrowing the principal and the
interest over again till it owes as much as the
most reckless financier can possibly desire. It
is only the hungry longing of the Foreign-trade
party to send the money out of the country in
the purchase of foreign material, which makes
it necessary to bring in foreign capital to keep
the nation going, and then the constant neces-
sity for sending out more money in payment of
interest to foreign bondholders makes it neces-
sary to bring in more foreign capital, and so on
ad infinitum.

More Freedom of Contract.
The other day Judge Worthington, of Vic-
toria, sentenced one William Smith to two
years’ imprisonment with hard labour for steal-
ing a ring, and while passing this sentence —
which, fora first offence, was a disgrace to any
civilised land—he took the opportunity to insult
the nation at large with some utterly gratuitous
and irrelevant remarks concerning the prin-
ciple of freedom of contract. Smith’s case
was a very ordinary one. He was out of work,
hungry, penniless, and hopeless—in other
words, he was one more victim of that commer-
cial depression which was brought about by th e
respectable swindlers who have lately been
floating banks and creating land-booms in
Victoria, - and who dine and liquor-up
with Judges’' in between times. The weather
was cold, and the homeless Smith seems to have
come to the conclusion that gaol was the only
refuge open to him. Therefore he deliberately
broke a jeweller’s window in open daylight,
and took out a ring, am] was promptly arrested.
Apparently he didn’t want the ring and only
desired to be locked up, but Judge Worthing,
ton chose to regard him as a hardened offender
and seemed to consider the jact that he was
hungry and unemployed as an aggravation of
his offence—in fact, to all appearance, he got
six months for theft, and the other eighteen for
being out of work. “ Men have only themselves
to blame,” Said the majesty of the law, “ ii
they cannot find employment, inasmuch as they
persistently refuse reasonable wages which they
recklessly fix on a scale above that which
employers are able to afford.” Now, there was
not one atom of evidence before the court to
show that William Smith had “ recklessly
fixed ” his wages on any scale which employers
couldn’t afford, or that he had refused any
wages whether reasonable or unreasonable, or
that he wasn’t even willing to work for his
board and the privilege of sleeping on top of
the coals, with no wages whatsoever. The
Judge’s harangue was only brutal, unreasoning
class bigotry ; he had heard that some men with
tattered clothes and broken boots wouldn’t
accept reasonable wages, and. as Smith’s
clothes were tattered he held that as sufficient
evidence that he belonged to them. Moreover,
Mr. Worthington’s own wages are fixed at a
higher rate than his employers —the nation—are
able to afford, and he persistently refuses
reasonable pay, which, in his case, and
considering his intellectual calibre, would
be about £2 per week. He has never had
to get up at six o’clock on a cold, wintry morn-
ing, and wait in the rain for two hours or so
outside the door of somebody who has advertised
for a porter, and fight with a hundred others
for a front place, and then find that the billet is
filled up, and have to go away for another day
of starvation and wretchedness. It is a pity
indeed that such Judges as Mr, Worthington
can’t be worked on the same great, free and en-
lightened principle that they are so fond of. It
would be a cheerful thing if the Government,
instead of appointing these individuals for life
at a big salary, Mould simply advertise every
morning for a Judge to sentence drunks and
petty thieves by contract, and it would
be a gladsome spectacle to see Worth-
ington struggling with fifty other Judges
outside the Chief Secretary’s door in the
hope of getting the job, and then going away
disconsolate because some bigger Judge trampled
over him, and got there first, and agreed
to sentence the whole lot for 3s, (id., before
he could get in. The entire Australian Bench
seems to suffer from a conviction that it is paid
to be a standing advocate of cheap labour and
non-unionism, and considering how frightfully
overpaid the Bench is, and that its members
belong to the most grasping and arrogant
trades-union that ever existed, this conduct is
either hypocrisy or utter heartlessness—or
both.
—
Mr. G. H. Reid, alleged leader of the New
South Wales Opposition, tries to trap the
Single-tax vote by the assertion that “Free-
trade would compel future Governments, if
increased taxation was required, to get it by
means of a tax on the unimproved value of land,
instead of out of the pockets of the masses.” It
is utterly impossible to suppose that Reid
believes this glaring rubbish—but he probably
thinks that a Freetrade audience is weak
enough to swallow anything. New South Wales
has had nearly fifty years of Freetrade already,
and though it lias had some very hard times its
fiscal policy (no matter how badly a stiff land-tax
was required) has never yet “ compelled ” it to
resort to a land-tax—it has only forced it
to collect over £2,000,000 per annum in
, Customs duties and to make up its short-
age out of loans. England has also had
nearly fifty years of Freetrade, and Free-
trade has never “compelled” it to impose a
land-tax either—it has only compelled it to
levy a.,larger .amount in Customs duties than
had ever before been dreamt of by the most
protected country upon earth. Freetrade, in
fact, has never yet compelled any country to
resort to a land-tax, though it has driven them
to Customs duties, income-tax, wholesale bor-
rowing, and all manner of expedients, and there
is no reason to believe it will produce any
belter results in the future than it did in the
past. And, at the best, Mr. Reid’s assertion
only means that Freetrade will make the country
so poor and wretched and utterly bankrupt
that it will have to levy upon the big landlords,
which merely signifies that Freetrade is a bad
thing which may by chance lead to a good
result. And in the same way if Mr. Reid died
of over-eating it might lead a whole lot of
gluttonous people to dine more moderately for
fear of a similar fate, but it doesn’t necessarily
follow that it would be a good thing for Mr.
Reid to die of over-eating. And, by exactly
the same process of reasoning, if Parkes fell
over a precipice with fatal results it might lead
to—but, on second thoughts, we won’t follow
this aspect of the case any further.

The Age suffers from another of its periodical
attacks of music-fever. The old fiction that
Melbourne is ever sighing for a permanent
orchestra of 50 performers and hungering for
the lofty melodics of great masters is set up m
type once again. Thin, pallid reasons for the
failure of orchestral concerts up to date are
followed by attenuated arguments to prove
that other concerts will certainly pay if the
“ music-loving public ” are appealed to. Bet,
all the while, the practical caterers for amuse-
ment, who arc open to make money by supply-
ing anything in which money is, have
reckoned up the musical public as a
“ bad mark.” It consists mainly of professors
and their little cliques of pupils and admirers.
The professors worship Beethoven and Go.

a inad bull might have wandered around the
Princess’s for a week without finding a red

believe that the people who didn’t come were
fearful of entering a theatre, and would have
rolled up to the same feast of sounds if given in
more serious class of building. They were
fearful of paying fair prices, and their absence
was entirely owing to the scarcity of “ paper.”
■ ♦ •
The other day a S.M. Herald scribe w’as told
off to write up the “ Produce Trade of Sussex -
street, Sydney,” for his paper. Says he, inter
alia in deploring the almost total absence of
the' home-grown potato from the Sydney
market:
Even the new tariff upon which the Protectionists
oased such sanguine expectations has made no difference
m this respect.
Of course it never occurred to this poor creature
that potatoes are not grown all the year round,
but are planted during August and September ;
; md seeing that the present New South Wales
tariff did not come into operation until
December last its benefits could not be secured
before the 1892 harvest. But this typical
Heraldite was no doubt instructed to import
into his article a hunk of Foreign-trade argu-
ment and he did it. Emboldened by his success
in “Freetrade ” logic, lie goes on to say :
Many agents say that the new duties have made no
iifferen.ee whatever in our home production. Some say
that they have led to an increased importation of seed
(potatoes).
A complete argument in favour of the duties.
For is not the seed intended for next month’s
planting, and will not the duties do exactly
what Protection, if sufficiently drastic,
always does —secure New South Wales’ own
market for her own people ? There were
many other crass inaccuracies in the article
referred to, but this is a fair sample of
the mush which the Herald ladles out to its
readers in support of its defunct policy.
The Age, which so barefacedly threw cold
water upon the Premier Building Association
prosecution in its first stages, and “ bore up ”
for Mat. Larkin when that bloated embezzler
was first arrested, is now conspicuous by its
backwardness in coming forward to speak plain
truths about Munro and Davies. According
to Age cablegrams, Matthew’s scheme for
reconstructing the Mercantile Bank was
“ favourably received ” in London which
would now appear to be a cable cram
of the first water. The same influential rag
mildly observes that “ that unfortunate institu-
tion, the Real Estate Bank,” has got into a
“ hopeless muddle ”—a sneaking insinuation
that nobody is seriously to blame in the matter.
For the past two years, or nearly, the Age has
been unfortunate enough to turn frequently its
blind eye on big financial scandals, whilst the
Argus— the solemn, respectable Argus —has
led the Melbourne cry for investigation and
vengeance. The situation is full of melancholy
humour. One paper occasionally attacks poli-
tical abuses, and frequently overlooks, if it does
not actually attempt to cover up, grave private
scandals—the other follows exactly opposite
lines of proceeding. The Argus has un-
doubtedly scored heavily against its rival by
being spared any political or personal tempta-
tion to support financial “ wrong ’tins.” It has
often struck a sympathetic chord in the pockets
of the public who have dropped their savings,
and the most Radical shareholder or depositor
buys the Argus these times if he wants a little
consolation in his misery.
Dear Bulletin, —In your issue of 2nd July
you mention Sir Thomas MTlwraith having
“swept the country with his short-lived
Nationalist policy.” That policy was a bogus
one and would never have been accepted but
for the fact that the country was terrified by
Griffith’s display of Imperialism as shown by
bis Naval Defence Bill, and in their sudden
terror the people grasped at MTlwraith’s
sham Nationalist policy as drowning men are
said to grasp at straws. The present writer
was both pleased and grieved to see the people
catching on to the fraud—grieved that they
should be so easily imposed upon by a wily
trickster whose every action had been a direct
contradiction to what he was then preaching, and
pleased because the very fact of the people
catching on so eagerly showed that they were
(e sirous of a really national programme and
were quite prepared to go the entire. animal in
iat direction. MTlwraith saw the opportunity
_ * ie embraced it. Since then the Democratic
patty has increased wonderfully, and when the 1
general election comes next year there will be a 1

people, encourage the despondent, impress the

The awkward rebuke delivered to the S.M.
Herald by its own evening Echo for an in-
delicacy has occasioned much diversion. The
other morning, the Herald announced in
its cable messages, relative to the great fire
at St. John’s, N. 8., that the bishop of the
diocese fled from his pilace in his shirt. Now,
the function allotted to the Echo is judged by
readers of the two journals to be, in a general
way, to give public expression to all the nasty,
mean little things which the people who run
both journals want to say, but don’t care to
print in the Herald ; but it looks as if the
Echo man occasionally disrelishes the humilia-
tions put upon him, and seized what he thought
was a chance to get level with the bosses of
the Herald. Anyhow, when he reprinted that
telegram, he omitted the dreadfully improper
part of it. He was not going to publish
anything calculated to expose the clergv
to ridicule, or to “bring a blush to the
cheek of the young person ” (Podsnax'). The
Herald staff might I’evel in such ribaldry, but
the Echo —never ! So he printed the cablegi’am
in a form as abbreviated as the Herald sug-
gested that the bishop’s attire was. But just
here the clumsiness came in. People who had
read in the Herald that the bishop had bolted
from the flames “in his shirt and without
shoes,” and who subsequently read the Echo
with its significant omission, could only form
the conclusion that the latter was in receipt of
later cablegrams which didn’t even mention a
shirt. A bishop without gaiters is a spectacle
apt to shake one’s faith in an over-ruling Pro-
vidence, but a bishop darting from his palace
without so much as a shirt! —why it is calcu-
lated to turn a whole population to infidelity
and agnosticism.

In the Victorian Assembly, the other day, Mr.
Melville made some strong references to “ the
case of the Real Estate Bank, in which half the
transactions are alleged to have been a swindle,
and were mixed up in the public press with the
name of the gentleman who had gone to
England to represent the Government.” Sub-
sequently this attack was carried a little further
by Mr. J. A. Wallace, who caused a multitude
of councillors to sit up and emit a horrified
“Oh!” when he added that “people were
starving now through being led into financial
companies by Mr. Munro.” The way in which
these statements were met and fenced with by
Messrs. Balfour, J. M. Davies, Macßain,
and Sargood, opens up a great question. One
and all of that virtuous quartette protested
against the casting of any slur upon the char-
acter of a person who couldn’t explain every-
thing to everybody’s satisfaction because he
had gone to Hingland. The solemn impudence
of such a defence was sufficiently appalling
without the incidental remark from Sargood
that “the statements published in the papers
were to be regretted.” :
One of the main objections to an income
tax lies in the fact that it falls heaviest on the
“ straight ” man whose income is derived from
sources which cannot be concealed, while the
crafty speculator in stores, agencies, horses ct
similia, grins barefacedly when the collector sighs
over his schedule.
Dear Bulletin, —There were some whole-
souled fellows on the Warrego (Q.) not so very
many years ago. Blank was clerk to the Targoo-
lahmine Divisional Board, and his books were
things of beauty to all save Government auditors.
Fortunately, before one of these officials could
swoop down, it was discovered that Blank’s
accounts were not correct, and there was'a deficit
of .£4O. Things looked like a trip to St. Helena.
But Blank was a decent sort of a chap, the best
pard on the river in a four-handed game, and
members of the board weren’t going to stand quiet
and see him lagged. Blank must resign. At the
Board-meeting, when Blank’s resignation was
handed in, the newspaper man arose and moved
“ that Mr. Blank’s resignation be accepted witli
regret, and that an honorarium of £5O be presented
to him, in recognition of bis long and valued ser-
vice.” Carried, non. con. The deficit was made
up therefrom, and tiie odd tenner “blewed, ’ in
style, the same night, at the pub. most adjacent
to the courthouse. — The Breaker.
The GUILELESS ABSENTEE
Friends, never speak a word of ill
Of anyone who’s cleared—
Don't c-.1l him names, but deem him slill
A thing to be revered ;
Although his banks have come to grief,
An 1 you for assets sigh,
L°* nofhlnjr sbak" your fond belief
In human purity.
0 ! never say that facts are facts
Concerning I. or J.,
Who didn’t justify their acts
Before they skipped away ;
01 ne’er assume that shady games
And dealings aught but white
Can be alleged against the names
Of parties out of sight.
Think not of making Jim explain
Where all the money went;
Let Matthew D. at “home" remain,
Secure and innocent;
For whilst they dwell beyond their seas
And have their praises sung
By kindred souls and C.M.G.’s—
Why, you must hold your tongue.
All Governments it e’er behoves
Religiously to strive
To bolster up the class of coves
Called “ representative,”
And when they’ve served their Gracious Quce;i,
’Tis meet that you should know
Their characters are sweet and clean
And like the driven snow.
Friends, never breathe a thought of ill
Against the absentee ;
The boy who slopes with master’s till
Is guiltless, donchersee;
No more shall smart absconding clerks
Have warrants on their track,
For magistrates won’t hear remarks
Behind a fellow’s back.
A thousand men in Melbourne town
Are ruined, more or less,
And “calls” have come (of half-a-crown)
To widows in distress ;
And people fancy this and that—
But O ! they musn’t say
These nasty things of Jim and Mat,
For why ? They've gone away !
The Old Whim Horse.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
lie’s an old grey horse, with his head bowed sadly,
And with dim old eyes and a queer roll aft.
With the off-fore sprung and the hind screwed
badly,
And lie’s marked all round with the brands of
graft;
And the grey old horse comes to wait and wonder
Why by night and day now the whim is still,
Why no voice is heard, and the stampers’ thunder
Sounds forth no more from the shattered mill.
In that whim he worked when the night winds
wrestled
With the waving trees on the hill o’erheatl,
And by day when the “ keets ” in the blossom
nestled,
As the seasons flourished, and waned, and fled ;
And he knew his shift, and the whistle’s warning,
And he knew the calls of the boys below.
Through the years, at night, or at eve, or
morning,
He had taken his turn in the old whim bow.
Now the whim stands still, and the wheeling
swallow
In the silent shaft hangs her home of clay,
And the lizards flirt and the swift snakes follow
O’er the grass-grown brace in the summer day ;
And the corn springs high in the cracks and
corners
Of the forge, and down where the timber lies;
And the crows are perched like a band of
mourners
On the broken huts on the Hermit’s Rise.
All the hands have gone, for the rich reef paid
out,
And the company waits till the calls come in ;
But the old grey horse, like the claim, is played
out;
And no market’s near for his bones and skin,
So they let him live, and they left him grazing
On the hills, and oft in the evening dim
I have seen him stand on the rises, gazing
At the ruined brace and the rotting whim.
The floods rush high in the gully under,
And the lightnings lash at the shrinking trees,
Or the cattle down from the ranges blunder
As the fires drive by on the summer breeze,
Still the old grey horse at the right hour wanders
To the lonely ring, tho’ the whistle’s dumb,
And with head bowed low by the bow he ponders
Where the whim boy’s gone—why the shifts
don’t come.
But there comes a night when he sees lights
glowing
In the roofless huts and the ravaged mill,
When he hears again all the stampers going—
Though the huts are dark and the stampers
still—
When he sees the steam to the black roof clinging,
And its shadows roll on the silver sands ;
And he knows the voice of his driver singing,
And the knocker’s clang where the braceman
stands.
See the old grey horse, like a creature dreaming.
On the ring once more take his ’customed place;
But the moon’s bright beams on the ruins stream-
ing
Show the scattered timbers and the grass-grown
brace.
Yet he hears the sled in the smithy falling,
And the empty truck as it rattles back,
And the boy who stands by the anvil, calling ;
And he “turns,” and backs, and he “takes up
slack.”
While the old drum creaks, and the shadows
shiver,
As the wind sweeps by, and the hut doors close,
And the bats dip down in the shaft, or quiver
In the ghostly light—round the grey horse goes;
And he feels the strain on his untouched shoulder.
Hears the voice again that was dear to him,
Sees the forms he knew, and his heart grows
bolder,
As he works his shift in the ghostly whim.
He hears in the sluices the water rushing
As the buckets drain and the doors fall back.
When the early dawn in the east is blushing,
He is limping still round the old, old track.
Now he sways and sinks, but, the foe defying,
High his head he lifts, and his old eyes glow;
Then he pitches down in the circle, dying,
From the ring no more will the grey horse go.
In a gully green, where a dam lies gleaming,
And the bush creeps back on the worked-out
claims,
And the sleepy crows in the sun sit, dreaming,
On the timbers grey and the charred hut
frames,
Where the logs slant down, and the hare is
squatting
In the high rank grass by the dried up course,
Nigh a shattered drum and a king-post rotting,
Are the bleaching bones of the old grey horse.

Dear Bulletin, —Your correspondent,
“ Black Art,” does not tell the whole story of the
blind wood-cutter of Lefroy. The man’s name is
Lee. He not only lost his eyesight by the gun-
accident, but parted with a few fingers at the
same time. Lee has since been lamed for life by
a nasty chop on the knee, but he still goes out with
his horse and dray, selects his tree, falls it, cuts it
up into the required lengths, loads his cart, and
puts down ITis pile wherever it is required. Lee
has ceased to be a curiosity/in Lefroy, where the
fame of a man who can drink 27 pints of beer at a
standing is still as fresh as it was five years ago.—

816 Macquarie-street North, Sydney, July 27,1892.
Mr Dear Moorabinda,—
The farewell benefit tendered to Mrs. Vanderveer
Greene, on 23rd, in Centennial Hall, was a success cf
numbers, and here and there of art, hut the latter only in
spots. For the singer whose simple song strikes jour
tympanum like the kick of a horse was pre-eminent in
shriek once or twice, and a decollette soprano actually
jumping into the air after a saw-sharpening top C, spoilt
part of the programme, which, I remember, was made
hideous by a villainous “likeness” of the charming
henefieiarj' that turned the lovelj- lady into something
like a hungry hawk.
But after a pill the preserve. Mrs. Van. Greene—in an
umbrella-skirted eau-de-nil silk gown—sang two songs,
multiplied by encores into four, with the breadth and
sweetness which are always hers, and was florallv com-
plime'ited with a basket of flowers and a very cleverly-
arranged floral banner of her nation. Mons. Deslouis
refused the encore for his dramatic rendering of
“ L’Africaise ; ” “ Willie ” Walsho made quite a scena of
“ Les Huguenots ; ” Poussard was there with his magnetic
fiddle ; likewise Kowalski furioso in an arrangement from
“ Don Giovanni ” (he never keeps to what he’s billed for);
these, with Charles Huenerhein (who had a hand in
everything) and ’Cello Strauss were responsible for those
portions of the programme which kept you from wonder-
ing what time it was.
The audience didn’t lack social axes at Mrs. Greene’s
benefit. In the Eastern balcony Lord and Lady Jersey
lent aV.R. glamour to the galleries, and downstairs we
had Mayor and Maj’oress Manning in the van. There
were many dresses—everybody had on one, of course, blit
the only distinctly swell frock in my eye-circle was a
cahhage-green silk—the very latest shade—which stood
out wonderfully in the Northern gallery. Lady Jersey
enlivened an old, sartorial friend with a chilly red opera-
cloak and committee flowers ; her eldest daughter appar-
ently wore pale-blue, hut the Centennial Hall is such a
desert that, unless jou take your telescope, you
can only vouch for what your immediate neighbour
is suffering in.
There was a meeting held last week in Sydney Town
Hall to talk about the collection of Australian women’s
work which is being got ready for Chicago exhibition.
Lady Jersey presided, with many sensible suggestions,
and it was definitely decided to hold, at the Town Hall,
during October, a display of all work sent in, prior to
shipping off to the land of wooden hams.
Through the laissez-faire nature of the Australian
woman, Lady Jersej r 's allies are becoming so desperate
for exhibits, that they will take meritorious work from
any woman, no matter if she has just arrived here for the
first time on the mail-steamer from " ’Ome.” For in-
stance, a very distinguished member of the works com-
mission (I won’t give names) went to a most hopelessly
English lady artist, fresh caught from Europe, and begged
her to let them have a painting which adorned her studio,
and which she had painted at Kensington Art School, and
brought out with her ! In vain she politely pleaded that
neither she nor her painting was Australian, but only a
point-blank “No!” got rid of the importunate seekers
after “Australian” women’s work! However, no harm
Is done by such little dodges, as one always approaches
an exhibition, or at least that part of it where women’s
and children’s efforts are set forth, with one’s tongue in
one’s cheek.
Don’t you think it rather a funny idea when you’re
giving an entertainment (with lots of patronage about it)
to have a list of almost every name in the audience
printed in full on the hind part of the programme? Not
only a boastful catalogue of Sir Thingummy and Lady
Asterisk, Sir So-and-So, the Boodler, and so on (the sort
of thing one always has to put up with), hut the labels of
almost everybody in the reserved area. They fixed it so
at a recent chavoo in Sydney—gave tho visiting-card
appellation of nearly every human being who had hooked
a scat—they even flourished the names of some of
the critics—of the evening-dress and toppy-hat genus, of
course! But the worst of it is that an idea like this
catches on at once, and I shan’t be a bit surprised if the
announcement—“ Your names on the back of the pro-
gramme on the reservation of two or more scats” becomes
quite a recognised bait for the half-crowns of the
populace.
The sixth performance of “Gondoliers,” at Her
Majesty’s, drew an audience which made a Melbourne
pressman draw a long breath and exclaim piteously, “I
haven't seen a house like this for six months!” And
another interesting thing was tho presence in front of
a certain pretty little actress’s flaneb, whom she marries
very shortly, and her consequent dodging of Ryley’s more
than usually Gondolie-y hugs. But what must it feel like
to sit and watch the idol of your dreams tickling some-
body else under the chin! By the way, can a certain
hounding actor have thrown out a splint, as the grooms
say, or what caused that unnatural undulation on one of
his ankles the other evening? The way his slim under-
standings have filled out since he came to Australia has
been matter for common enraptured comment.
Jennie Leo had a beg, good-tempered audience at her
benefit on 21st inst. at (he Imperial Opera House, hut
whoever arranged the programme spoilt the artistic
success of the affair by allowing a willowy lady amateur
of the inumhle-gumhlo stamp to goad the pit to madness
in the “ Happy Pair.” Hhe was personally a cheap litho-
graph copy of Brown-Potter, tousled hair, draggly cloth-
ing and all, and her "acting” wasn’t a bad rechauffe of
the same ladj’s lighter methods, hut the stage is not her
home all the same. Nature has dowered her with a voice
like the voice of the sluggard complaining from beneath
four feather-pillows, and unless she means to play star
rdles in a band-box she had better retire and reflect.
The indigenous Australienne, even when she has got
her waist down to nineteen inches and has learnt to stare
stonily, is not a highly-grained and polished human pro-
duct, and the mother of daughters must often look round
and wonder who there is to teach her Melpomene
“manners?” But there is nobody in the whole length of
this continent. When she leaves schoolrooms behind her
it rests with herself whether she will be a model of grace or
a galoot. She knows she shouldn’t yawn without a shelter,
and that she mustn’t sniff, but her governesses don’t go
much beyond that, and the average Australian girl is pro-
jected into sassiety with a visage absolutely untrained to
meet the many surprises of fashionable life. Don’t wonder
why I am jeremiadiiig like this—my inspiration is an
advt. in a London paper-an ordinary, every-day sort of
announcement which calls attention to the fact that Mrs.
Blank teaches “ grace of figure and expression ; how to
dress to look well; to walk ;to look young and beautiful ;
to smile ; to frown ; everything pertaining to the customs
and habits of gentlewomen !” Lovely, isn’t it ?as a revel-
ation what a charmingly natural creature the English
belle must be! Something like a mechanical toy with
directions to “press the button to the right and the doll
sings ‘ Annie Rooney.’ ” No wonder she finds her Aus-
tralian prototype “free and easy.” Imagine the uncouth-
ness of the girl who doesn’t know when it’s time to scowl
at you!
Woman’s manner reminds me that a health-journal tells
us to smile “with the eyes only,” because the amiable
creature who goes through life d la Cheshire cat is liable
to get as creased after a while as last year’s pippin. But
smiling with the eyes is the trick of the flirtatious, yet
discreet, female who wouldn’t let her victim presume for
worlds, but doesn’t mind letting him hope, you know.
Men don’t like the woman who makes eyes with an
unexpressive lower countenance ; they size her up as a
hypocrite smiling a mechanical smile for delusive pur-
poses. But, mind you, I’d rather have her than the other
sort who make monkey faces supposed to he captivating
whenever a pair of coat tails flickers in the east.
Who are the trio of female figures in tho centre
medallion on the Imperial Opera House act-drop? One
lady in dun colour is nursing her knees in mid-air with
arms like oars ; the middle Venus has apparently a green
life-buoy round her waist and simply endless limbs, and is
supporting a rose-pink female who hangs into space with
her arms coming out of her sides and a head like a bottle-
stopper.
A curious thing—at the eye-glass-managed haunt of
Thespis mentioned above —is to see how hard it is Un-
popular artists to play down to a pit and not up to a
gallery. There are no gods at the Imperial, and the lady
of tights and comic vocalism, when she directs a flashing
wink at where Olympia ought to he, either ogles some
patcr-familias who has come in with the “ girls ” because
somebody said there was a moral in it, or else her
coquetry wastes itself on the hole in (ho roof where the
lonely limelight man awaits ids opportunity. To remedy
this obvious defect how would it he if the management
suspended a few gods by the hair from the skylight until
the favourites get used to the theatre?
What I particularly remarked in the d.c. of a certain
theatre the other night was a recent-amateur-hut-now-
real-live actress, very red about the cheek-bones, of
course. The way tho stage-struck amateur, who has at
last “ got on,” puts on beauty in private must he a
caution to the old hands who arc mostly content lobe
seen by daylight the colour of a kidney potato.
Otherwise the circle was uninteresting, and one had
lots of time to consider Gourlay how he grew big enough
to fill that wonderful check suit in which he lets his hack
hair down and looks just like Daddy Hallewell in tartan
trews. Sirs. Bennett, an actress of the profile variety
who paints herself with a millet-broom, judging by the
effect, wandered through the farce in a couple of ordinary
garments and a ohippy-lookingdelaine cloak and fly-away
hat—just the sort of guise, though, in which to meet a
stray lover by moonlight in a public park. The only
other hit of fashion about the theatre was tiie treasurer’s
boutonniere, which seems to get larger with each new
play produced.
With women talking twenty to the dozen about all sorts
of subjects, one can’t exactly feel hurt at the conduct of
an old bachelor who resides in a Sydney suburb, and who,
to make uu for the lack of feminine society, has philo-
sophically provided himself with four magpies and three
cockatoos ! No wonder lie doesn’t get married.
Sydney Amateur Orchestral Society held their second
concert in the Centennial Hall last week, and renewed
their first success. The bill was classic and enjoyable, as
the encores showed, and (hough you can’t really goby
the shrieks of an audience—which is individually a
mother, or an uncle, or a sweetheart, or some sort of a
relative to the platform performers—your inner con-
sciousness tells you if the rapture is deserved or not.
And I felt glad at every repetition, for orchestral music
is scarce just now,
A pair of proud S.A. parents recently gave what must
have been a lively sort of entertainment it was a babies’
party to celebrate the birthday of their only child. 1 don’t
really know, mind you, that it was their only child, hut
philosophy teaches me that when there are eleven infants
tearing one another to pieces in the nursery, the fond
mamma doesn’t give eleven parties per annum.
At this infantile shivoo there were some sixty squallers
from six months to three years. One pauses to wonder
how the delicate question of refreshment was got over by
the hostess ; and what nwans were used to keep sixty
infants from parti-coloured convulsions and free fights
would make interesting reading if I only knew,
I am sorry to hear that the health of the gentleman
who was the innocent cause of the late Lord Ancram’s
death has become affected in a most lamentable way.
Yet another charity hop on the tapestry. A big hall
(as the inaugm-ators hope) is to bo hold some time in Sep-
tember, in Sydney Town Hall, in aid of the Boys’ Brigade
—a deserving aggregate which keeps its eye on the gamins
and poor little street fry. There is an influential com-
mittee, and Mr. A. Kirkcaldic is lion. sec. Tickets, 12s. Od.
Mr. and Madame Charhonnet-Kellerman gave a musical
“at home” to meet Commander Poydehot, of the Armand
Behic, on 20th inst., and although the lion failed to roar
as his hark was still on the sea, regrets were forgotten
when the music began.
I am told in two private letters that one of the curiosities
at Lady Salisbury's last reception in London was the wife
of a Victorian official who wore the most extraordinary
gown that was ever seen at such a function. It must
have been made in the Imckhlooks, and it attracted as
much attention as if the wearer had just come out of the
Ark.

A wildly grotesque affair is “Skipped by
the Light of the Moon,” which blazed up at
Sydney Opera House on Saturday last, and is
still blazing. It is partly comedy, partly farce,
partly delirious burlesque, partly pantomime, with
a certain amount of song-and-dance business
thrown in ; also, it is everything by turns and
nothing long, and the audience laughs all the
while, until its frock gives way and rips down the
back. It would have been a good piece for the
original Gaiety Co, to tackle, if Fred. Leslie had
got over the wall and barked to represent tho
bulldog. Included in it are two giddy hypo-
crites, who are supposed to be attending a
Y.M.C. A. conference, and who send the photo, of a
half-dressed ballet-girl to their wives as a proof of
their bona-fides, and only find out the mistake
when they try to gloat over the portrait of a fully-
dressed preacher, whereupon they rob the mail to
get back the compromising epistle, and, instead of
getting it, steal another man’s letter with a remit-
tance in it, whereupon they are chased by a
Scotch policeman with an Irish accent, and,
climbing hastily over a wall, they fall into the
mouth of a large dog, and, climbing back again,
they nearly fall upon their wives. Also, there are
the two wives who leave an infant for a moment
with a servant, who hands it to another girl, who
gives it to a man to hold for her, who deposits it
with various other people, so that at last it vanishes
altogether, till a man is seen falling out of a win-
dow with it, and a policeman catches it, whereby a
detective gets a black-eye, and the rheumatic foot
of a certain heavy father swells up till it obscures
the landscape, in consequence of which he isn’t
able to run after Lis daughter’s lover with a huge
stick so fast as be wants to, and that individual
COUNTESS OF ORKNEY (CONNIE GILCHRIST).
escapes until the third act, when two infuriated
women arrest him by the hair. Further, there is
a distracted yohng man who isn’t himself, but
somebody else, and an ungrateful daughter in a
pale-green frock, and a detective who never
detects anything, and a mother weeping over her
lost child, and an officer slinking around in search
of beer and pie, and these individuals fall reck-
lessly off roofs and out of high windows like dis-
tracted indiarubber monkeys bounding in a forest
of steel springs and gutta-percha.

The principal monkey in the crowd is that
limber, boneless comedian John Gourlay, who
seems to be made of gristle and wire. The other
good young man who gloats over the unclothed
ballet-girl is played by George Walton, and the
success is principally owing to this pair who con-
duct themselves like two snufflebuaters possessed
with a devil. Mrs. Bennett, as the nice little girl
who is embraced by Mr. Jewett, gives a better
performance than anything she lias yet done.
Mr. Grevillo—the swelled father with rheumatism
and Mr. Shine arc also at their best, only
why the latter should play Felice man MTntyre
with an Irish accent and a flaring red head

That beautiful* fairy opera, 1 lolantlie,’
will bo put up at Sydney Majesty’s on Saturday
(July 3U), with “Charity Begins at Homo ” for
an afterpiece. “ lolanthe ” is, if possible, a shade
brighter and more taking than “ The Gondoliers ”
—at least, that is the private and personal opinion
of the Goth who writes this notice- and when it
is finished, to judge by present financial pro-
spects, J. ('. Williamson will be mad, with
cheques and bank notes in his hair. Meanwhile,
the twin monardis of Barataria are keeping all
right, and tho Grand Inquisitor is healthy, and
the wives of the two mouarehs arc doing as well as
can be expected, and tho Duke of Plaza-Tor
(Limited) has been audited and found correct and
all is gay, except Mr. Sydney Deane whose conn
tenance is like the countenance of Augustus when
he called wildly to Varus to give him back hi
legions. 8

Jennie Lee’s benefit at Sydney Opera
House was a stragglesome affair which had most
of the symptoms mentioned in the liver-nip
advertisements and the porous-plaster announce
ments. It was a very long show, and con
seqnently it got jammed towards the end like a
giraffe trying to get round a narrow corner, and
there were too many items in it, and some of the
items travelled very heavily for want of being-
greased. Moreover, the house was crowded, and
the pit, which had evidently been drinking,’tried
to make a beast of itself towards eleven o’clock
and succeeded even better than might have been
expected—in fact, it made eight distinct beasts if
not more. The first act of “The Grasshopper”
conducted principally by Miss Jennie Lee and
Messrs. Poulton, Lash Gordon, Jewett, and Shine
was a real success, and following that came the
first act of “Jane,” in which Miss Myra Kemble
brought down the house with acclamation. Then
Miss Albu sang " ‘ KiHarney ” in a vigorous voice
and after that things began to flounder heavily’
and occasional thuds could be heard as if the
actors were killing each other behind the scenes
Jennie Lee’s new song was hampered a good deai
by the fact that she hadn’t had time to learn the
words; and a little sketch entitled “A Happy
Pair” came to grief in the pit. Miss Alice Per-
gusson, an amateur of considerable ability, and
Mr. Lash Gordon had the stage to themselves in
this item, and the lady was not so audible as she
might have been, and the yells and vociferations
of the pit and its demands that she should
“speak up ’’—which she didn’t—reduced the house
to something approaching chaos. Finally
Miss Jennie Lee came before the curtain
in a flushed and excited state as if she had
just executed Miss Fergusson and the unburied
remains of that lady were weighing heavily upon
her soul, and was presented with a wreath. She
also thanked the audience, and made a few pointed
observations about the pit, which was an obvious
waste of time ; she ought simply to have come out
with a shot-gun and emptied it at the shilling
seats on general principles. After that the last
items on the programme were successfully omitted,
with the exception of a scene
from “Jo”—which would
have been a triumphal con-
clusion, only most of the
dress-circle was gone by that
time, partly owing to the
lateness of the hour, and
partly for fear the pit should
break out and rend tl em
asunder-and the proceedings
ended far on in {he night,
when the hotels were shut
and no one could get a
drink for love or money,
except at a place in Efskine-
street, wherea belated nigger
was selling squash on a liar-
row.

illusions—the person who
walks in the air, and the
man who is chained down on
a board and then vanishes,
his place being taken by a
woman are still in full
bloom, and no one has yet
found out the mystery of
either of them. If Mr.
Hertz only knew i t
he is losing a great chance
to earn popularity and
undying gratitude-in Sydney. If he would dis-
card his assistant for one night, and send Mr.
Abigail up in the air instead of him, and make
that gentleman float there until he pays off tho
depositors of the Australian Banking Co. in full,
he would bring down the house ; and if, when the
chained-up gentleman vanishes off the board,
instead of a girl appearing in his place the
audience could find those two lost financiers, Bel
and Davis, fastened bv the leg to the plank and
struggling desperately to get away back to South
America, there would arise a roar of joy which
would blow the roof off the Garrick and bulge tho
walls out into the street.

rpi 10 Parker - Rignuld arrangement of
“ Faust,” which somehow suggests the skeleton of
('oethe’s poem tricked out in a fin de siecle suit
- glops, was produced at Melbourne Princess’ on
Saturday- Apart from a few ingenious novelties
i the stage-supernatural department, this revival
" f the Girl, the Flesh, and the Devil has nothing
to recommend it in preference to the orthodox
“Faust” which Hignold played at the Opera
House some six or seven years ago. The Devil
personally has degenerated in some respects. At
the outset, after popping up, piping hot, from the
Mace where most men go, he doesn’t come to the
point quick enough. He grows garrulous with
advancing years, apparently, and cuts the cheapest
kind of jokes with all the smug complacency of a
police magistrate. Also his bad leg is cronker
than it used to be. A lack of unearthliness is
noticeable in his serio-comic songs, and ho seems a
commonplace lump of infamy, as a rule. In fact,
there’s a general impression of Deeming about this
jocular Satan. However, notwithstanding that
he isn’t much of a King of Evil, nor the
least bit of a fallen angel, George Rignold
puts much strong work into his performance
raid iseffecti vein the limelight throughout the show.
Marguerite is naturally, tenderly, and, above all,
ver y youthfully presented by Miss Bessie
Rimiolcl. She loves, suffers and repents iu a style
that attracts the sympathy of every body in front,
an d her ascension to Heaven is a pleasing incident.
Old Faust fills the part of auditor to the Devil’s
ptrotistical orations iu a spirit of self-abnegation,
whilst Cosgrove, as young Faust, never appears to
be haunted by the recollection that lie was sud-
denly run up by contract. The Martha of Miss
Blanche Lewis is an aggravating uncertainty, and
several other people leave room for improvement.
Scenery and optical illusions, being now as they
were in Sydney, go far towards covering the
literary deficiencies of this new “ Faust.” Things
didn’t work quite right on Saturday, though, and
prior to Satan’s first appearance in a cloud of
steam his familiar voice had been heard from afar,
commanding some invisible minion to leave a
window open.

“ The Times,” despite its inherent bitter'
ness and confusion of purpose, is going well at the
Bijou. An idea that Brough’s discomfiture and
unpathetic collapse are bits of wholesome fun
seems to prevail, and a large proportion of the
multitude laugh at the misery of a chastened snob
simply because it is Brough who buries his face in
the sofa cushion. For such people the faults of
“The Times” lie under the surface and are not
matters for regret. Nevertheless, it is a good
play undoubtedly gone wrong. Pinero has come
out with several other plays which were striking
examples of how a brilliant dialogue writer, clever
delineator of character, and master of stage business
can go out of his way to build an inartistic story.
But this is exceptionally good. Moreover it
doesn’t go wrong until the end is near, and its wit
lias struck home. The retirement of Annie
Taylor, whose place is taken by Bessie Major,
hasn’t made the performance more excellent than
it was at first, though the action is a little more
brisk. Miss Marie Fraser introduces herself to
Melbourne notice iu the minor character of an
over-educated maiden who has crammed her weary
head with a chronic ache. She figures as the niece
of Miss Cazalet (Miss Romer) until in a moment
of unguarded emotion she calls the other spinster,
“mother!” “ Little fool!” says her bogus aunt,
“I knew you’d let that out one day.” . The
incident has no bearing on the plot. The author
throws iu the disclosure gratuitously, and its
humour is characteristic of his play.

Mrs. Bernard Becre bade her Melbourne

demonstration being provided for the occasion,
Mrs. Beere and Co. will, it is understood, depart

hood of the. lady saying another goodbye at the
end of a third season. But you can never tell
what may happen to a travelling “star.” The

One of the sights of C illins-sfcreet lately is a certain

Alf. Massina, of Melbourne, who accompanied Bern-

One evening, just before the mail left, Sara Bernhardt
was expected to recite at London Lyric Club for some

incontinently departed, not to return.
George Darrell (says our London correspondent) has

Janet Achurch lias been at the point of death; cause,

Janet) must have dropped a pot of money.
Clement Scott, D.T. critic, feeds cockney vanity with
such taffy as this:—“Sarah Bernhardt loves a London
audience. She may he careless, indifferent, wilful, or
mutinous elsewhere —seldom hero, and never on a first
night. It is an historical fact that the ‘divine Sara’
never plays so well as on a first night in London.” All
of which is bosh. J. C. Williamson, who has had a far
wider experience of Sara’s acting than the oracle of Fleet-
street, said that her first performance in Australia was
the .finest thing he ever saw her accomplish, whilst Sara
herself has expressed a dislike for London audiences, and
says that, outside of Paris, she scores her greatest Euro-
pean triumphs in Amsterdam. So there, now! Sara
miy not lie as mutinous in London as she was in Mel-
bourne. Cleopatra, according to the D.T. notice, “had
to act down (he laugh when a low comedian slave wriggled
on his stomach and turned the play into a farce.” Munie,
the low comedian referred to, provoked the same laugh
on the first night of “Cleopatra ” at Melbourne Princess’,
hut Sara didn’t content herself with acting it down. She
curled her lip at the house and said, “ O, enough !” in
choice English, and the house enoughed on tiie instant.
■Sara shut tlic laugh up, in fact.

Curly is like a boar with a sore head, and talks of the

business has been at a very low ebb for some time past,

represented the slid! which makes the mare to go. Even
at the St. James “Lady Windermere’s Fan ” has ceased to

The “New Wing,” a reemt success in England, is
intended to utterly squash Socialism—and this is how it
starts. The heroine is a General’s daughter - she believes
in Socialism. Her lover is a baronet—he doesn’t believe.
He resalves to show the girl that Socialism is a mistake.
Therefore he disguises himself as a workman, and he and
another man corns to paper the house. The real work-
man is coarse, red-faced, pimpled, beery, and smells of
short pipes, and he spits on the carpet. The baronet
doesn’t spit. After they have papered the house the girl
realises that Socialism is all wrong, and she marries the
baronet, and when the curtain comes down a nefarious
democratic theory is understood to he squashed. Either
(ho moral is that all Socialists spit on the carpet, or else
that only a gentleman can make a good paper-hanger —
no one knows which.

Tiie London Star on “Hero and Leander” as done
by Mrs. Brown Bellew and Mr. Kyrle Potter :—O
Aphrodite, what things are done in thy name ! Such
things as “Hero and Leander,” O Aphrodite, at the
Shaftesbury, where they do persistently take thy name in
vain, hut where they do not know how to sp-II it. O
Aphrodite, who wast—l say “ wast,” O Aphrodite,
because they are very fond of “wast” and “ wouldst,”
and “hadst,” and other forms in “st” at the Shaftesbury
—who wast the goddess of loveliness, and who rose—l
mean rossst—from the sea, if thou couldst but look down
on the loveliness of Mrs. Brown-Potter and Miss Edith
Chester, and the other virgins of thy temple at the
Shaftesbury, and upon Mr. Kyrle Bellew rising from the
sea—from the patent linoleum waves of the many-
saunding sea, in fact, O, Aphrodite-why then I wonder-
wliat thou wouldst say. And then Mrs. Hero Brown-
Potter takes the veil, notwithstanding the protests of
Mr. Leander Kyrle Bellew, whose classic Greek limbs are
appropriately tattooed witli the flags of the British Mer-
cantile Marine, O Aphrodite, and the virgins of thy temple
do intone a hymn which is much like the hymns (ancient
and modern) chanted in the churches of ill > Christians.
Only there is no collection, O Aphrodite. Know further
that in the second act Hero hangs out her lamp, which
she calls a “ lah-ah-alunp,” as a beacon for her tattooed
adorer, who swims the Hellespont and yet comes out of
the water quite dry. Why, O Aphrodite? Because if he
had been wet, Hero would not have fallen into his arms,
as she does at the Shaftesbury. just as the (tantalising)
curtain descends on the second act. Know yet again
that in the third act thy virgins sing another hymn to
Eros (whose name they pronounce with a‘ long e and a
short o, O Aphrodit',) until they are driven away by the
High Priest and Dick Deadeye, who insist upon ex-
tinguishing Hero’s lah-ah-alunp, in order that Leander
may he drowned in the patent kamptulicon waves of
poluphloish —you know what I mean, O Aphrodite. And
when he is drowned Hero flings herself in after him, and
thy virgins sing the audience out with yet another hymn.
And the language of these Greeks is very nineteenth-
,century English, O Aphrodite, and their robes are garish,
and their dances are of the school of the sacred lamp—l
should say, la-ah-ahmp-and altogether this “Hero and
Leander” arrides me not, O Aphrodite.

After 55 days of court-sitting, the big

By 40 votes to 4, Queensland Legislative
Assembly has passed M. B. Gannon’s motion :
“That no Judge shall sit alone in court or
chambers in any matter in which his son acts as
counsel.” This is a flank movement against Chief
Justice Lilley, and his son Edwin, who, for some
reason or other, gets most of the briefs in cases
that are beard in his father’s court. Ten to one
is a tolerably decided majority ; but then, as
Morgan, M,P., remarked, at present it is possible
for one member of a family (evidently referring to
Charles Lilley, of Lilley and O’Sullivan, solicitors)
to be instructed in a case ; for that member to brief
another member of the same family (Brother
Ned); and for the case to be heard before a third
member of the family (the dad of both). The
Noes to the motion were—Sir S. W. Griffith,
g.C., Hodgkinson, Sayers and Hoolan. Barrister
rake walked outside the bar and declined to
vote. The only lawyer who voted boldly for the
motion was Charley Powers, M.P. for the
Burmin. The rest of the devil’s contingent were,
according to the division-list, carefully absent.
Judging from a number of apologetic and
semi-apologetic statements in the daily papers
there is just one redeeming feature about that
miserable proceeding whereby soi-disant Repub-
lican Premier Dibbs sunk into knighthood—he
refused the “honour” when it was first offered
him, and only succumbed to a “command ” from
the Queen conveyed in her own royal handwriting.
Iu other words, the woman tempted Dibbs and lie
did become a K.C.M.G. What a classical picture
it would make - the fall of Dibbs, if done after
the manner of the sketches in the good, little
Sunday-school books, where a naked Adam, partly
concealed by the branch of a tree, falls through
the temptation of an Eve mid nodings on, modestly
hidden behind a shrub. Also what a long anil
bony Adam Dibbs would make roaming in a
state of nature through the bovvers of Paradise-
on-the-Solent, and what an unspeakable row there
would be about Eve when she was published !
But, to come down to ordinary prose, and view-
ing Dibbs in a commonplace aspect with his
clothes on, the excuse about the royal “command”
is altogether too thin. If Victoria had invited
Dibbs to be hanged for her special amusement
and satisfaction, or to become a Eoreign-trader
(which would be just as reasonable as asking
him to change from Republicanism to Im-
perialism), or if she had asked him to elope with
an aged widow, or to commit suicide, he would
probably have refused, and if a royal “command”
isn’t binding iu one instance it is not in the
other. The one excuse that can be offered for the
fallen Republican is that lie is a man with tin
unusually large number of female relatives, and
possibly be lias been bowled out so often
when he tried to stand his ground against a lady
that ho lias given up making the attempt, and
simply knocked under from force of habit.
“ ’Tis not in mortals to command success,
but we’ll do more, Sempronius—we’ll deserve it.”
Something of this sort must have crossed our
readers' minds on learning that Dibbs had been
knighted. Sensible men of all shades of opinion
can have but one feeling for the man who poses
as a Republican and greedily clutches a nick-
name when be gets the chance. When our
“ Longfellow ” returns, the bauble is to be kept in
the Sydney Safe Deposit.*

The success of Pulvennaoher’s System of Self-Applicable so deservedly obtained during the last 25 years, has prompted a host of enw

There is trouble in the British royal family
just now over a point of etiquette. Eight years
ago the Duke of Albany died and left a vacant
chair. He was a thin, feeble youth with fits, and
he had a skin that was so thin that he was in
danger of bursting every day after dinner; also
he was religious in a depressed and wretched sort
of way; and, finally, he went on a very small
spree, and after a glass of ginger ale and a cigarette
he fell down some steps and died. His widow has
worn weeds and lived in strict seclusion ever since,
but at last she grew tired of feeding on great
hunks of melancholy, and having cold grief every
day for dinner. But Victoria put her foot down,
and declared that the bereaved lady must remain
bathed in woe and shed tears in a dark room till
the day of her death, and in the end the daughter-
in-law rose in insurrection, and banged her mis-
shapen crape bonnet on the floor, or something to
that effect,.', afid refused to go weeping over
Albany’s tomb any m.qre, and at latest advices
she had been exiled to Germany, where she will
probably reihain.

Domino.
I SUPPOSE that Domino means Master,* in soni o
sense or another. For instance, when the slan?.
whanging billiard-marker says “Domino” instead
of “game” he means that one has conquered the
other. This puts me in mind that gaming is t OQ
serious to be considered a game, when there j s
money on it. If I pass at euchre I say “pass.”
Tommy the Nut and the Derwent Nugget, eth'oc

fore I don’t play with them. I plead guilty
however, to “Pop” for shout, instead of “Jq
propose ” at ecarte —who plays ecarte in the bush ’
But poor old Domino said that word in answer to
almost any demand or <%t the completion of any
job. If you asked him to bring round your horse
“Domino.” When you tipped him a shilling on
mounting, “Domino.” At'the end of each of the
two pints in which he invested that coin, “f) 0 .
mino.” When he closed the stable-door, “Domino.”
His grace after meals, the identical trisyllable.
Having lit the front lamp, as usual. When he
left for bed, his Are, just the same. His transla-
tion of Bravo or Encore resulted in the never-ending
expression. Therefore, he got the name of
Domino. No one during his life at the Arch ever
knew his other name. He could read and write
but at his quarterly settling he just signed an
oblong: with twelve dots round the edge—six on
each side. He was groom and rouseabout at the
Marble Arch, a public-house in the Saltbush
district. I knew him for years, and I knew no
wrong of him. He was always clean and neat •
seldom quite sober, never insensibly drunk. His
room was the picture of tidiness, and he had some
very good clothes. He had a secret, which I dis-
covered by chance. And it was love. The publi-
can’s daughter was just the beginning and the
end of his adoration. When the blacks were
about, Domino camped on the verandah near
Prudie’s door. There was never any doubt about
the girths or reins on Pru.’s hack when she rode
to church, twelve miles, once a month. The
buggy and harness were clean and shiny when Miss
Maccaferi went to the Baranna Show or the Shan-
dandera races, although they might be a bit
spotty when old Maccaferi and the Countess
wanted them for a drive. Domino was not old
and was not bad-looking; and I fancy Pru. had a
sort of penchant for him. She did lead him a
dance. It was her business to milk and attend to
the dairy. Still Domino bailed up the cows,
carried the buckets, scalded the dishes, scrubbed
the slabs and floor, turned the churn, and washed
it after use. All this in addition to his other
duties, and all for love of Miss Prudencia. As I
said, he spent his wages and was constant at his
post. _ Once a year, however, he went to Shandair-
dera in the coach for some private business which
no one inquired into. Macca. said it could not be
for a spree, because he only took a pound and
brought back some shillings. His passage was
free, because he looked after the mail horses. One
day he was after a heifer which was to be broken
in, when he nissed the coach and asked me for a
lift to the town. I was only too glad to take him
for company, and I heard the eternal “Domino”
each time he mounted after a gate. Then he let
out that he was going to make his will and leave
it in the bank. It seems he was not well and had
been depositing some yearly sum from home
without touching it. I went with him and we
drew out a simple will leaving his all to Prudence
Maccaferi, of the Marble Arch, near Shandandera,
N.S.W. Nevermind the amount, and don’t ask
for his name. He was back home next day. Then
came the breaking of the heifer. The latter broke
“Domino.” When his back was turned the
wretch rushed him and horned him. Prudie had
climbed up the fence. Poor old Dom held on to
the bale and just said one word, “Domino,”and
died as he had lived, at the feet of love.
There was a Frenchman at the funeral who told
me what I already knew, that the hospital argot
in France for a loaded coffin is a “Box of
Dominoes. ”

Christie Murray’s embroglio with the com-
mittee of the Savage Club ended in a compromise.
The attendance at the meeting called to discuss
the matter was so great that the club-house could
not accommodate all, Murray, in arraigning the
committee for their censure, made an eloquent
speech. He somewhat sarcastically admitted that
he had committed a technical mistake in not more
carefully editing the list of those to whom he
addressed his circular on behalf of Odell, and he
made a great hit when he asked what the big
literary men who formed that original “circle of
brains and brotherhood called the Savage Club
would say were it possible for them to know that
a Savage had been accused of impropriety m
making an appeal to his fellow-members on behalf
of a distressed brother. Several members then
hinted at the propriety of some kind of compro-
mise, and eventually it was decided amid applause
that while the meeting was of opinion that the
committee had not acted ultra vires in taking the
matter up as they had done, the resolution censur-
ing Murray should be expunged from the minute-
book.

much vaunted retaliatory stock-tax. It would
hurt the Melbourne squatters who, witli the
banks, run that Northern province.
The Holder Ministry have dropped Tom
Rayford’s Indian Tamil labour scheme. The
Chinaman will therefore continue to hold un-
divided sway in the Northern Territory.
Gladstone will he Premier for the fourth
time —unprecedented. Derby had it three times,
but for comparatively short intervals. Palmerston
held out to Gladstone’s age, as Premier.

The new Brisbane daily is to be called The

Neither of the two Queensland leaders,
Griffith or MTlwraith, has, since the change of
front on the Kanaka question, dared to meet his
constituents at a public meeting within the city
of Brisbane.
MTlwraith was returned for North Bias'
bane distinctly pledged not to re-introduce either

Ihe prediction is that Griffith’s Triangular
Telescopic Constitution Bill will be read a second
time by Bananaland Assembly, fiddled with in
committee and lost in some lobby. That is how
the Kanakilgriff will attempt to hoodwink both
his supporters and the separationists.
The radical “ Billy ” Brooks, M.L.C. (Q.),
for years Griffith’s colleague in the representation
of North Brisbane :
We have got at the helm a man who believes in nothing
but machinery—a man who is not in sympathy with
human nature, human feeling, or human blood.
Pleasant to think that the leading light of
the bogus Patriotic League did more to popularise
“Looking Backward” in Queensland than any
labour enthusiast. Also, that MTlwraith kicks
himself every time he thinks of his name at the
head of that province’s subscription to the dockers’
strike.
Should Gladstone fail once more, his ad-
versity will beDilke’s opportunity. Dilke, at the
head of a really progressive democratic element,
would lead his party to ultimate victory. He has
the ability, as well as the recollection of past
slights from so-called “Liberals,” to carry him
through.
The latest capitalistic idea in Bananaland
is to treat with the Indian Government for the
indentation of coolies unlimited, with their wives
and families, each old-man coolie to be paid the
handsome salary of £l3 a-year and family rations,
besides one turban, one loin-wrap and one suit of
pyjamas ; the labour of the wives and children to
be thrown in.
The Griffilwraith Ministry are seriously
contemplating the absolute repeal of the Payment
of Members Bill. Politics are a matter of'bread
and butter to a good few of the sycophantic
followers of the coalition, but allowing even for
the secession of these The Bulletin has every
reason to believe that this crowning act of infamy
will be performed.
PROTECTING THE REVENUE.
BORDER SERGEANT: “This is the fourth moke we’ve settled over this job, Dennis; ride on
and order beds, and another horse; my instructions are to spare no expense in
collecting that £2 duty.”
H. H. Champion did learn something over
here, after all, and now preaches that “the eight
hours movement, if it means anything, means a
revival of Protection so as to raise the condition
of the masses of workers now unprotected from
the unbearable strain of unrestricted competition
under Freetrade.”
“ One of them Labour leaders, Mr,
Speaker, as ought to be in gaol, sir, went to my
constituency and addressed a meeting, sir, and lie
called the lion, the Premier a dog, sir, and he said,
sir, that the lion, the Colonial Treasurer was a
’og, sir.” —Speech by the late Walter Adams, in the
Queensland Assembly.
Although Maoriland Parliament’s protest
against the Queensland Kanaka slave-trade revival
is regarded in the quarter at which it is aimed as
the impertinent interference of an outsider, yet
there is a moral satisfaction in knowing that it
was embodied in a Government resolution and was
carried by a majority of 34 to 18.
John Donaldson, 1 lie suspected leader of
a third political party in Queensland, is too weak-
fibred to be relied on. The sort of man who
professes teetotalism as a virtue and an example,
and invests in brewery shares as a source of profit,
lias ioo many friends all-round to be ever dis-
tinctively useful to any one party.
Randal, the Queensland emigration lec-
turer, is still, despite Griffith’s solemn assurance
that the emigration policy is abolished, holding
forth in England about the advantages of the
“ village settlement scheme,’.’ and is imploring
the British Hodge to come .out and take up the
land which was supposed to be opened for the
benefit of the unemployed population. Verily the
average emigration lecturer would hold forth
about the bright green verdure in Sheol, and the
water-frontage allotments along the blackened
shores of the Styx, and the pastures which'would
support two horned devils to the. acre.

A committee of investigation appointed by
the U.S. Congress reports, after taking a great
mass of evidence, that the cost of living has been
reduced by 3 per cent, since the M‘Kinley Act
came into force, through the all round diminution
of prices. This cablegram excited much deep
silence among the Freetrade papers of Sydney.
Dibbs left N.S. W. as “ The only Republi-
can Australian Premier who has ever visited
England.” This was his own boast. A man of
that sort had to be squelched. He accepted a
Knighthood at the autograph invitation of Queen
Victoria, who stepped down from the throne to
pull the “Republican Premier’s ” teeth.
Poor little Hodgkin son, the Minister for
Mines (Q.) and member for the Burke, is intro-
ducing a Bill to halve his electorate, which he
isn’t game to go within a hundred miles of. He
intends to cut out the “ proputty ” half for him-
self, and when the general elections come round to
sit and poke fun across the fence at John Hoolan’s
hairy-toothed constituents, who have been wait-
ing to meet him up that way a long time now.
What are oaths worth, after all ? When
Napoleon was elected President of France, he
took a terrific oath of fidelity, saying : “ May this
right arm wither if it is ever raised against the
integrity of the Republic.” Then he overset the
Republic, and he didn’t wither, and when he died
after being a bogus Csesar for twenty years, it was
not his arm, but his stomach, that went wrong.
Barlow’s accepted amendment to the
Elections Bill lately before Queensland Parliament
provides for contingent voting, and is said to pre-
vent minorities returning members. It’s a com-
plicated puzzle, and disputes as to how it works
have already separated many old friends. One
result will be the further disfranchisement of the
worker, who, unable to elucidate the puzzle, will
neglect contingent voting altogether.

In connection with Judge Denniston’s
ruling that the Licensing Act of Maoriland was
not a prohibitionist measure, and that the Syden-
ham licensing committee acted illegally in neglect-
ing to consider the requirements of those who
wanted to purchase liquor in Canterbury, it is in-
structive to note that during the past year the
Canadian Temperance Act has been repealed by
the electors of the province of Ontario, while
throughout the 64 counties of the entire Dominion
in 33 only does the measure yet survive.
Five years’imprisonment and to be hanged
at the end of that time, is the sentence passed by
the Bulgarian courts on the alleged assassin (if
Boltcheff, Minister of Finance. There is a won-
derful ingenuity about the codes of the little rat-
trap States of Eastern Europe, and the things that
are done outside the limits of the eode are more
ingenious still. The leader of the Bulgarian
Opposition was arrested a while ago chiefly because
the Government majority was getting shaky, and
then the Premier called round and had him
stripped naked in his cell, and flogged himVwith a
large leather strap. He was then -officially tor-
tured by the hangman, and hung no bv the feet
off and on for over "ayear, and finally he'has been
sentenced to a long term in gaol. ' The Govern-
ment has commanded a steady majority ever since
then.

Says an American paper :
' The most devilish and effective attack yet made upon
the Single-tax movement was that of the ingenious man
; who bequeathed a large fortune to Henry George in a
contestible will. At last advices the great reformer,
broken in health and mind, bad spent the ultimate cent
of his life’s accumulations in defending the legacy, and
was borrowing money to sue his own lawyer for the brass
button that remains of it. During these proceedings the
Single-tax movement, left to the guidance of Mr. George’s
disciples, has been steered in 750 directions, and its trail
resembles a parallel of latitude through the centre of dis-
turbance in a Japanese earthquake.
Under the peculiar conditions of the
naturalisation laws in connection with the
exclusion from the Queensland slave trade
of aliens who have_ only been naturalised under
Australian provincial laws, a more grievous
disability exists when the legal points are dove-
tailed with others in Griffith’s new Workers’
Disfranchising Act. An alien who has been
naturalised in another province is, under this new
Act, still a foreigner in Queensland and is debarred
from exercising any vote at an election. One
Kruger, naturalised in N.S. W,, has been declared
incapable of voting by a Bundaberg (Q.) magi.
trate.
The Victorian Bible-in-schools league has
a fixed resolve to introduce the Irish national
senes of school-books into Australia, and it is
constantly howling for the adoption of these
admirable works.” This is sufficient evidence
that there is nothing Australian about the league
—it is a doddering importation and nothing more,
ibe books it is so anxious about are full of
rampant Protestantism and bog-trotting lore from
one end to the other. There is nothing in them
but facts afiout Macgillicuddy’s Reeks, and the
dead O’Briens and O’Tooles, and if they were
used for a few years the rising generation would
hardly know that there was such a place as
Australia, and would fancy that the outside world
was all Ireland.
According to a new Act which has just
come in force in W.A., any person absenting
himself from his “lawful master” without suffi-
cient notice is liable to be fined or imprisoned, and
after his line is paid or his term of imprisonment
is finished he will be returned to his “lawful
master ’by the authority of the law. This, it is
supposed, will obviate strikes, for every man who
goes on strike will be promptly arrested. There is
nothing in about the master who absents
himself from his employe without due notice, but
that doesn t matter —if there was anything the
aforesaid master would sit on the bench to hear
the case, and then promptly discharge himself
without a stain on his alleged character.
There tare signs of a rift in the Griffilwraith
combination following. Griffith’s Three-in-One
1 rovmces Bill is the acid in the alkali. For the
alternative probability of the absolute separation
of the North and Central districtsis.astill stronger
ferment, and all that applies to his attempted
provincial compromise applies with greater force
to the more I rojan remedy. And Griffith’s scheme
scares the land-boomers and ring-fakirs of South
Queensland, because (they argue) “proputty will
depreciate in the South directly the North and
Central districts are not governed from Brisbane
i.e., as soon as trade is decentralised to its
natural geographical localities. The Griffilwraith
power depends chiefly on the support of Southern
speculators and boodlers.
The Review of Reviews upon Gladstone :
He has never, so far as I can remember, in the whole
course ot Ins unparalleled career, made a speech that
betrayed even a glimmering ray of sympathy with the
wrongs under which women labour. . . . At the
close of a long life, no statesman lias seemed so stolid and
so persistently blind to them. ... The explanation
is not difficult. Mr. Gladstone is a parliamentarian who
lives on the electoral plane; women are not on that plane,
t..eiefore women do not enter into the sphere within
which ms conception of justice applies. .. . If women
had had votes he would have been as keen to see their
wrongs as if they had been men ; but they had no votes,
and he would not listen. . . . Wherein lies the ex-
planation of this great mystery' ? Surely nowhere save in
the fact that personal rights are so inseparably linked
with political privilege that Mr. Gladstone could not
realise a wrong that was inflicted merely on a thinn with-
out a vote. J
This is the position of. the Griffilwraith
Land-giant Railway Bill up to date. Sixteen
clauses have been approved of. These provide
briefly that the poles of the proposed line shall be
determined, but the syndicate may construct the
line by whatever route it pleases#. The allotment
of the land-payment shall be by “alternative
choice,” which is a very different thing from alter,
native blocks. The mining rights go with the
blocks. A double payment in land and money is
to be the reward of the constructing company.
The area of the land blocks is unfixed, as is also
the minimum price of the land. There can no
longer be any doubt that the whole thing has been
cut and dried, and that the hugest job ever carried
out in Australia is now being perpetrated in the
Queensland Assembly.
The Maoriland Government runs a life-
insurance department of its own, and now it pro-
poses to take another step in the direction of
socialism by the compulsory insurance in that
department of all civil servants. The department
will take them in the lump as healthy lives, and if
a particularly unhealthy or diseased gentleman
has to be accepted now and then, the great mass
of business done will cover the loss. Every civil
servant will be retired at 60; if he dies before
that age he will get the amount of his policy ; and
if he survives it he can either take a fixed sum or
an annuity until death. The policies can’t bo
sold, neither can they be seized by creditors, or
transferred in any way. And while it is at work,
the Ballanco Government might as well enact
that all the policies issued by its office shall bo
unsaleable and unattachable by creditors in the
same way. The seizure of an insurance policy for
debt is about as barbarous as the old fashion of
seizing a family and selling it for the benefit of
the father’s creditors.

At a certain vice-regal residence a little
stranger is expected shortly. Mrs. Jobkins, a
leading society woman, as vulgar as she is wealthy,
recently met the vice-regal hostess at a reception,
and blurted out, “Oh, madam, you must really
give the little dear a Haustralian name !” There
were about twenty people within earshot, and her
ladyship was so pleased.

Speaking of Darmont—his position in
Divine Sara’s esteem was “spotted” at a glance
by a Bulletin representative, even before the
white-skinned young Frenchman had appeared as
Marc Antony. On the night of Sara’s debut, at
Melbourne Princess’s, a tall, slim, poetical stranger
came up from the lower stage regions and watched
“ Camille” from the dress-circle staircase leading
thereto. When the eye of The Bulletin observer
had taken in this vision he applied to Phil
Greenwood for information concerning it, but
Williamson’s factotum didn’t yet know the
Adonis on the stairs by sight, or name—
couldn’t say whether he belonged to the French
company, in fact. “That must be Sara’s mash,”
suggested the seeker after truth. So it was. At
least it turned out to be the Marc Antony of nine
nights later. Love no doubt inspired this sudden
conviction on the unsupported evidence of the
senses. Sara had fascinated her 099th (or there-
abouts) journalist, and the unhappy victim of a
hopeless, distant attachment knew his favoured
rival by instinct. Whether this weird peculiar
incident accounted for Darmont’s threat to storm
The Bulletin office when he reached Sydney,
and beat the editor to death with the mangled
limbs of the office-staff, vvou'd seem to be a
matter for psychological conjecture.

There was a death lately in the family of
a very rich man living in N.S.W., and a friend,

for kind sympathy. Collect.”

On a Western (Q ) station a little while
ago, one colonial-experiencer bit a piece out of

stolen the peer’s gin.

A single woman takes up a homestead
selection under the present law. Next to her
patch, an agreeable and eligible young bachelor
also takes up a selection. The neighbours become
friendly, and there is the usual result as between
fire and tow. Now : If the selectress marries her
neighbour, the law steps in and forfeits her
selection. If she only cohabits with him on the
hither side of the broomstick, the law looks on
approvingly and considers her a good settler and
one to be encouraged. Both she and the young
man keep their selections, and live in “a state of
sin.” The achievement of that result is one of the
chief and most glorious aims of the Queensland
homestead settlement law.

Per mail delivered in Sydney on Monday :
One of the most striking figures at the recent State-
concert at Buckingham Palace was j our Premier. Ho
looked realij' splendid in his official livery. He for some
time struck against wearing any uniform, but Lord
Knutsford persuaded him to do so, telling him it was p
matter of etiquette which must be observed. A man who
was there tells me that Dibbs was “the cynosure of
neighbouring eyes,” and more than one fair dame asked
that he might be introduced to them. He stood for some
time amongst the Royal Circle and engaged in a pro-
tracted conversation with the Princess Christian. It is
evident that an attack is being made by these swells upon
George’s republicanism, but, so far, lie is unchanged and
unspoiled.
And now !

could not find the name on any map.

writes a London correspondent of The Bulletin,
“are having a brand-new coat-of-arms designed
by the officials of* the Heralds’ College. I was
privileged to see a drawing of it a few days ago,
and can certify that it is a most gorgeous affair.
No descendant of any of William the Conqueror's

Dear Bulletin, — Touching that (alleged)
Bohemian Club in Brisbane. The members mostly
wear broadcloth and purple and fine linen, pay
cash for their liquor, and are eminently respect-
able all round. Rumour hath it ('si nonevero)
that a would-be member was pilled because his
boots were half-soled. The members are princi-
pally recruited from the (apparently) wealthy
merchants of the city, the daisy barristers
and . solicitors, and the Bench, with a re-
porter or two thrown in to add a flavour
of Bohemianism. As a matter of fact, the prin-
cipal object of this “ Bohemian ” club is to enable
Smith, the prosperous trader, who is going ’Ome,
to got into the Savage Club on his Brisbane-club
qualification. A specimen of their Bohemianism.
Eoli and Harley were invited to the house-dinner,
but Pechtosch was left out. He had once been
a humble music-teacher in Brisbane, and so could
not be received by the magnates of the club.
Foil’s health was drunk, and went at that; he
neither spoke nor sang, presumably because a
brother professional had been slighted.

Dear Bulletin, — Do you know that a

between the pomps and vanities of Petty’s Hotel

interesting as a relic of “The System’’than any
M.L.O. in N.S.W.’s recognised collection. When
the Upper House goes to the wall, this is the one it
should go to, standing, as it does, on the blurmd

The police on Sunday “ licensing-duty ”
in Melbourne will do anything to get a conviction.
In a recent case it was sworn that the policeman
had his leg bandaged and his arm in a sling, and
implored the licensee “to give me a drink, for
Cod’s sake, as I’ve walked all the way from Mor-
dialloc.” And yet the publican was fined, though
the policeman admitted the bandaging. Con-
stables who get convictions under such circum-
stances should be fined themselves.

Editor Bulletin, —Is it not time oceps
were taken to prevent resident magistrates from
being officially wedded for worse and worse and
for ever and ever to one district ? The further
you get away from the metropolis the greater the
stipendiary magistrate’s power becomes, till in
some parts he is a small tin god, whose rule
becomes very oppressive indeed. After a time he
becomes a big landowner, and a ring—or “ push”
—is formed of which he is the nucleus. He
is president of the local land-board, licensing
board, &c., &c., and as he, as a rule, is made on
the same system as other mortals, it cannot pos-
sibly be expected that by degrees he will not
become biassed in his rulings. Nor has the
private individual who suffers under his prejudice
any remedy, for it is one thing to prove to the
common mind that a flagrant injustice has been
committed from a moral point of view, and
quite another and more difficult to prove that the
same is the case from a legal standpoint. This
system of taking root in a place is also unfair to
the magistrate himself. It is time the authorities
take upon themselves the divine duty of leading
resident magistrates out of temptation by remov-
ing them —forcibly if they will not go willingly—
to a new district, say, every six years.—Toby.

It is not necessary in order that the

welcome unless they are willing to surrender up
part of their anatomy to feed the hospital eats or
instruct the hospital hangers-on in the art of dis-
section.” The Bulletin has nothing whatever to
say against St. Vincent’s Hospital as an institution,
but, until, like the other hospitals, it places
itself under the Hospitals Act and submits to
State inspection it should get no money out of the

The cablegram announces that the young
Earl of Orkney has married that charming little
innocent, Connie Gilchrist. Some 15 years ago
the Gilchrist family, consisting of four sisters—
Sally, Tilly, Polly and Connie—were well-known
in London art circles as nude models who were
thoroughly up in their work. They all had excel-
lent figures, they had been virtually born in the
business and were without a vestige of mock
modesty. At that time Connie was a sharp,
bright little girl, a spoilt child of the studios,
and her portrait in the costume of Eve before the
arrival of the serpent is to'be found in several
pictures of Leighton, Poynter, and other well-
known painters. A good many of the London
models find employment in the off season as ballet
girls. Connie early learned to dance, and her
performances at some highly Bohemian entertain-
ments at a third-rate suburban music-hall arrested
the attention of John Hollingshed, ever on the
look out for oil for the sacred lamp. The success
she attained at the Gaiety was immediate and
phenomenal. Her skipping-rope dance brought the
shallow-pated Johnnies to her feet and she was not
slow to exercise her powei’. In what lay her
fascination it w'ould not be easy to determine. She
was not pretty, she had no voice, and she took so
little interest in her art that she could never have
become an actress, even had she possessed any
ambition in that direction. But Connie had bee
brought up in a good school for discovering the
faults and foibles of human nature; she had
listened to the talk of clever men and had realised
how easy it is to separate a fool from his money.
And now she has reached the end of the second
volume of her history by marrying an earl, and
will be henceforth known to the world as the
Countess of Orkney. To emphasise her triumph
over the passions of her admirers, the bride com-
pelled (for it can scarcely be imagined that any
sane person would do it of his own free will) her
former “protector ” to give her away at the altar
—a dramatic conclusion to a realistic romance.

Eighteen months ago, eight leading com-
mercial travellers, “ doing ” the Queensland coast,
entered into a compact, which was duly signed
and made legal. Each member, on the first of
every month, was to place <£s to a joint account
opened in a local bank, the deposits to be left
standing until April, '93, when the existing mem-
bers were to draw the proceeds and take a trip to
Chicago Exhibition ; any member not paying up
to forfeit his right to any part of the sum total.
Last month two of them dropped out, and now
three of the remainder find that if they leave their
places will be filled up, and they also intend to
forfeit. At present there is £640 to the credit of
those still in. If all but one dropped out, how

, Tl ie y were sluicing an old bed of sand
norn the primitive battery of the ancient Star,
ior the sake of the pyrites and the fine gold, which
Latter had run over the ill-silvered plates of tl o
original tin-pot mill as freely as it had gathered in
tlie boxes and the ripples. Young Sam Bates
oversaw the job, a position awarded him by the
management in accordance with the understand-
ing that he and his brother were always to have
hist show when anything better than ordinary
was available about the mine.
Years ago the directorate gravely recorded
amongst the minutes of the company its resolution
to see the widow and orphans of Andrew Batts,
the first underground manager of the mine, well
provided for. They had honourably upheld this
resolve by making the boys work hard for their
living on top and below, firstly as battery-feeders,
then, when their muscles developed, as truckers,
and eventually on the brace and in the face.
Andrew Bates was the discoverer of the reef,
but iiad lost all interest in it in the mysterious
process of floating, and lived to see strangers grow
wealthy out of the find that yielded him bare
wages. It was only presumed that Mrs. Bates
was a widow and her children orphans, but the
presumption was rational as Bates mysteriously
disappeared one wild night when there was a big
flood in the gully, and the country for miles
around was mangled by a storm that is historical
in the district. The manager left home one after-
noon some years previous to the time of this story,
and struck out across Mount Bluff for the nearest
station, expecting to reach town by the last train.
He had been called up to attend a special meeting
of his creditors. Bates was never seen again by
anyone who knew him, and the lung and laborious
search instituted by the people of the locality
a .forded not a shred of evidence to hint at the
manner of his going off. Every dam and deserted
claim for miles around was carefully explored,
and every hollow or cranny into which his body
might have been washed by tire flood waters that
bailed down the gully was inspected in vain. Bates
had disappeared from the face.of the earth, and his
friends could not even form a rational conjecture
as to his fate. The great dam of the Star especi-
ally was carefully and thoroughly searched, under
the presumption that the missing man had re-
turned during the storm, and fallen into the deep
water whilst attempting to go along the bank,
which was the only convenient way across from
the mine to his house. The dam yielded no sign.
* # #
Dividends had fallen off painfully of late,
and the success of the new system of treating
pyrites suggested to the company the advisability
of sluicing the old sands. This bed of sand was
banked in the gully directly below the dam. A
large syphon was rigged over the embankment,
and a sluice carried the water and sand to the
boxes a little lower down. The syphon was fixed
up by an amateur in a hurry, and the joints were
not perfectly air-tight, so that she took air, and
ran down once or twice in a shift, when we had to
drive the bungs in, and give her a fresh start by
filling the pipes with water through a plug-hole in
the elbow. To do this, one man stood half-way
down the bank, and passed the buckets to his
mate on top, who fed the syphon, or “gave her a
drink,” as the process was termed.
One afternoon Bates and Naylor were on the
job, giving her a drink as usual, and expending an
unusual amount of profanity over the under-
taking. A cold, cutting wind blowing down the
gully increased the unpleasantness of the billet,
and intensified the bitterness of Sam’s language.
The young man had just filled the large iron
bucket, and was bringing it up to the hand of his
mate with a swing, when his foot slipped from
under him, and he fell face downwards, sprawling
on the wet clay ; the bucket, overturning
above, drenched him from top to toe, and he slid
down the bank and brought up with his feet in the
dam. As soon as he had recovered his breath, ho
was about to do credit to the occasion by an out-
burst of feeling, when his eyes became transfixed,
and his jaw fell, and, wet as it was, his hair stood
up on his head for horror. Staring out of the bank
directly before his face, and grinning into his very
teeth, was a man’s skull, clean and complete.
Sam glared at the apparition for a few seconds,
and slid further down, till he knelt shivering,
in the water. Then he pointed a trembling finger,
and gasped ;
“ Great Heaven, Naylor, there’s my o!e man 1 ”
That was “ the ole man,” or, at least, his mortal
remains. It is now presumed that Andrew Bates,
when the storm caught him, gave up his idea of
reaching the station, and returned towards his
home. Whilst crossing the gully along the bank
in the darkness, and contending with the wind, he
stepped off the track, not into the dam, but into a
narrow hole close to the bank that had once been
boxed in and served as a pump well for the
battery, but which was then timberless and nearly
full of slurry. The place was too narrow for a
man to help himself, once in it, and Bates must
have drowned or suffocated without a struggle.
The flood carried a quantity of mullock and
rubbish up out of the bed of the dam, completely
filling the old well, and hiding' the dead man
where mortal would never think of seeking him.
In passing up and down to water the syphon,
we had worn steps in the steep bank, and the top
of the skull had been exposed for some time, and
formed a good footing without exciting any atten-
tion whatever, till Sam’s foot, in slipping, broke
away a big cake of clay, and exposed the whole of
the ghastly face to the light of day.
We dug the bank down, and found the skeleton
standing, erect and entire.
“Lord forgive me! for five months I’ve been
stepping on my ole man’s head ! ” said Sam.

Women’s Suffrage.
Deau Bulletin, -In your issue of 23rd July
your correspondent, “ Charles dunor,’’ advances
lIn; following projositious to prove that women
should still rank with lunatics, aboriginals, con-
victs, and the hke so far as political power is con-
cerned ; —(1) “ The desirableness of women’s
suffrage is a matter readily disposed of.” (2)
“ Women’s tendency is to vote directly against
her male relative’s interest and support unre-
servedly any smug mediocrity who travels solely
on liquor abolition, Bible-in-schools,’ 1 &c. (3)
The writer can't see why a woman shouldn’t bo
content to let “ her nearest male relative” vote
for her. (4) Women are better as they are,
because the male elector takes more care of them
in matters of legislation than they could of them-
selves. These are the heads of Mr. Junor’s dis-
course, slightly condensed, and they are brutal,
cold-blooded Toryism of the narrowest order.
About a hundred years ago your correspondent,
if he had been alive then, wouldn't have had a
vote for exactly the same reasons. In those days
(I) the desirability of any man except a big land-
lord having a vote, was “ easily disposed of ; ” (2)
the poor man couldn’t be entrusted with a vote,
because he exhibited a tendency to us it against
the big landlord’s interest, and because he was so
ignorant that he would support unreservedly
any smug mediocrity, &c. ; (3) the writer of
those days didn't sec why the ordinary citizen,
like Mr. Junor, shouldn't let his landlord vote
for him; and (4) ho was bettor as he was,
because his landlord took more care of him than
lie could of himself. The democracy objected to
all this ancient rot, however, on the ground that
they didn’t want to bo taken care of, and that
every sane human being had a right to help in
g ivtrning himself, and if lie did it badly it was
Ids own look-out. After long years of conflict the
masses have, to a very large extent, carried their
point, and having secured a great measure of
liberty for themselves they straightway demand
that no one else shall have any. And to support
this contention they use exactly the same
arguments which the} 7 denounced so violently
when they were used against themselves. The
old Tory said that the workman wasn’t fit
to have the franchise because he was a kind of in-
ferior animal, and that he shouldn’t have it
because he manifested a tendency to vote against
his (the said blatant Tory’s) interests; the modern
democrat says that women are not fit to have the
franchise, because they are inferior animals, and
that if they had it they would vote against his
(the equally blatant democrat’s) interests. Neither
of them cares a straw for anybody’s interests
except his own ; they are equally democratic—in
looking after their own interests, and equally con-
servative in their utter neglect of the interests of
everybody else.
# # #
The plea that no woman should have the suffrage
because her sex lias a blind and incurable tendency
to support the solemn snuffler who wants to
abolish liquor, or to have the Bible read in schools,
and because she would vote solidly for the person
with the beautiful moustache; and, further,
because she is a priest-governed individual who
follows unquestioningly the instructions of her
spiritual advisers, is interesting, no doubt. But
the accusation comes with a bad grace from the
male alleged democracy which has for so many
years supported such dull mediocrities as Play-
ford, Griffith, MTlwraith, Gillies, Munro, More-
head. Vogel, MCulloch, and their kind ; which
voted for Parkes through 30 solid .years because of
his hair, and supported Jawbone Neild by reason
of his moustache, which is so miserably priest-
ridden that it sacrifices its interests and its
country, for the sake of Dutch William and his
servant Abigail, which votes for Freetrade because
the big importers tell it to do so, and sells itself
to the Single-tax faddists, and howls itself hoarse
over teetotalism and the Bible-in-schools, and
which never in all its imbecile career once knew
when to come in out of the wet. The spectacle of
the male elector denying the suffrage to women
because they might do what he does himself, and
has always done, and seemingly will do till the
end of time, is pitiable hypocrisy. If it is right
for man to refuse the franchise to woman lest her
enfranchisement should in some way injure his
interests, then it is right for the rich man to refuse
the franchise to the poor man for exactly the same
reasons. Each one is looking after his own interests
and doesn’t care a straw for anything beyond.
Further, I notice that another correspondent
advances, as an unanswerable settlement of the
suffrage question, the statement —possibly quite a
true one—that “except child-bearing there is
nothing women can do that cannot bo better done
by men, including cooking, nursing, and macrame
work.” This idea is capable of indefinite exten-
sion. There is nothing the pauper can do that the
man who isn’t a pauper can’t do better, therefore
the pauper shouldn’t have a vote. There is noth-
ing the Australian can do up to date—barring
athletics—that the Englishman or the American
can’t do better, therefore the Australian shouldn’t
have a vote. There is hardly anything the nigger
can do that the white man can’t do better, there-
fore the nigger should be squashed. And by the
same rule no man should have a vote unless there
is something that he can do better than anybody
else on earth, and the franchise should be restricted
to about a hundred individuals, all told. - Yours,
&c., Titus Salt.
WHAT
IT FEELS
LIKE
HAVE you ever observed how a man behaves
when he has the toothache? Life is full
of bitterness to him, and swear words linger on
his lips. He arises after a night of torment,
comes down to breakfast in a temper the reverse
of angelic, and, having bestowed a vicious kick
upon the harmless, necessary cat which presumed
to meet him on the stairs, seats himself at the
table, and assumes a scowling expression
eminently calculated to sour the contents of the
cream jug. Asked whether his toothache is not a
little easier, he Snaps out, “You don’t suppose
it will stop aching just because you think it ought
to.” Ho gulps down a few strong expressions,
finds fault with the chop, the coffee, the behaviour
of the children, and gives particular prominence
to the fact that very few men are blessed with a
long-suffering disposition like his. Watch him as
he walks to business in the city. How affection-
ately he presses his hand to the jaw from whence
springs all the cause of his woe and mentally
exclaims, “Oh, that mine enemy had this torture.”
The world has ceased to have any charm for him.
He even forgets how to be entertaining in the
presence of his favourite barmaid, and manifests
displeasure when she smiles at the figure he cuts
while trying to hold a sip of brandy in that corner
of his mouth where the affected molar is located.
This exquisite torture must have been the lot of
Shakespere, when he explained the truism,
“ For there was never yet philosopher
That could endure the toothache patiently.”
Had Shakespere lived in the present age, how-
ever, he would have known that there is no need
to endure, either partially or otherwise, the
torture of a decaying tooth, since toothache may
be effectually and speedily conquered by the use
of St. Jacob’s Oil. There is, in fact, no bodilv
pain that it will not remove. It penetrates gently
and quickly ; it soothes perfectly ; it heals surely ;
it cures promptly, permanently and without re-
action. Thus invaluable medicine has taken the
leading prizes wherever exhibited, and has firmly
established itself as the best domestic remedy in
the world for rheumatism, neuralgia, backache,
and a host of minor complaints which are the
daily cause of so much misery and suffering;

SPORTING NOTIONS.
Queensland and N.S. Wales did not play their
ver.i best men in Inst 1 Saturday’s interprovincial football-
match. Three Brisbane cracks -Brcreton, Beale, and
Beattie— have broken collar-bones, and so has Abbott, the
Sydney ’Varsity champion. Nice, healthy game, football.
Tot. Mutineer, the most sensational Sydney player, was
overlooked by the selection committee, Mr. M. Arnold.
Toe crowd won’t stand this again.
* * #
Proceedings nearly started with a free fight in
fie grand-stand. A wretch wfiio had drink in him asked
a man not to intercept the view —asked him by placing a
lighted cigar on the nape of the other man’s neck. The
r .7w which arose out of this event exhi'arated tiie assem-
blage, who greeted the teams with a storm of welcome.
» # *
The Bananalanders wore dark-blue jerseys and
white pants. The home team donned white pants and
awful jerseys-voluminous sickly blue-bags, apparently
all made for the Oft. Tin. stature of Monty Arnold (line
umpire), tor the slack of those bags hung about the
jj.y. Males men in folds, and streamed out in the
breeze, and served in place of back-hair or tails
for the other fellows to drag them down by.
The game started with the wind behind Brisbane, War-
brick having won the toss from Colquhoun. In the first
ten minutes the Brisbaneites got three free kicks for off-
side, and Graham just missed scoring a goal off the third,
fir the hall struck the goal-post and bounded back into
p'ay. The game became a series of scrums—just human
dog-lights—heads bobbing, bodies surging, legs and feet
flying at all angles for the ball amid thwacks, grants, and
thuds. Every time the Brisbane forwards came out on
top, either by bearing their opponents down and dribbling
the'ball through their midst, or by “heeling” it out and
“feeding” their halves, who would dash away with it
evidently intending to get over the Sydney line alive or
dead. “Jimmy” M’Mahon, the Sydney full-back, is a
player who uses his head. He needed to. When-
ever a Brisbaneite came whirring through the
nick the vast crowd would climb on the fence
and enjoy itself, and yell, “ Holy smoke, Jimmy !” “ Flop
h in, Jimmy!” “Oh, Sydney! my native land!” “Flop
biin !” M‘Mahon always charged the enemy bull-fashion,
clumping his head into the other fellow’s stomach and
tossing him high in the air. Twice in the first half, by
v-,and rushes which completely paralysed the home team,
the Brisbaneites got over. The whole Brisbane team
used to gel under way simultaneously and come full
steam ahead ; they were too heavy and clever for the
enemy, and, M’Mahon exoepted, the Sydney backs were
palpably weak on the defensive. The second try gave the
crowd a rare sensation. Maori Warbrick, the Brisbane
captain, got the ball and came along at a great
p-ioe. One Sydneyite tried to collar him low, but
Warbrick smote him in the eye with ins knee-
joint and sent him yards. Then two more Syd-
neyites rushed at Warbrick together, and the
three strong athletes collided with a crash, and fell in a
heap. Next instant Queensland scored a try, and then
everybody saw that Warbrick was laid out. He was like
a man that had been stepped on by a thunderbolt. Half-
time was called, and as no barrow was handy to remove
the dead, he was carried in. He resurrected and came
out again in the second half as game as ever. During the
interval the crowd’s ardour was not suffered to cool, for a
handsome procession of assorted athletes in silken gar-
ments of every hue, jigged in stately order around the
arena. This was the 1090 yards handicap. It was a
gorgeous prance, and ended in a splendid race between
Flett and Dalryinple—the latter winning.
* * *
The second half of the match was a repet’tion of
the first—just scrum, scrum, serum, more choking, more
grassing, more travail, more gruel, more Queensland than
N.S.W. always. Now and then a Sydney man would make
a brilliant individual effort, but be was always garrotted
before he got dangerous. Sydney never, scored a point.
The feature of the match was the magnificent play of
O'Shea, the Brisbane half back. ID secured three tries
out of four. Towards the close of the day’s play, he made
a wonderful ran right from his own 25. lie is a light-
weight—a flyer. He darted in and out through the
opposing team like a swallow, and when he sped over the
line and scored fourth try for Queensland, 8010 lungs in
full blast cheered him to the echo. The 21st interpro-
vincial match was a real good time for Queensland.
“Tatters ill” is playing the game a little low
down in having a l>ig sweep on all the minor races about
Sydney, and, as a matter of course, ho now never raises
the full nuinh 'r, and lias to draw pro-rala. Another
trouble is that Taft. I is horse-owners know who draw
their nags, thus giving the shady owners—and unfortu-
nately the majoiily belong to the list -the opportunity of
blackmailing the drawer of a horse under the threat of
scratching him. Tattersall had hetle' ‘go slow” or he
will kill the goose.
# * #
A Queensland correspondent suggests to The
Bulletin’ that. Tatt. should write under registered cover
to the drawers of all unclaimed prizes in Its sweep during
the last five years. Sliou’d this not lead to the amounts
being claimed, our correspondent urges that the money
should hi distributed among the charities—it is the
people’s in mey, and Taltersall’s profits are certainly good
enough without retaining any unclaiiu.il surplus.
# # *
How will Go Idard fare against Jackson ? Well,
despite that draw, very badly. Firstly, he is too slow ;
next, he is a “rasher,” and rushing suits the black’s
style, as impact adds force to his blow. Jackson may be
beaten by a in ui equally quick and clever, witli greater
reach and height, or a panther of the S iliivan type may
break down his guard, or a small *r man like Mitchell may
wear him <1 >wn in a ring tight, as Siyers and Mace did to
their bigger opponents, but one who is, though slow, a
ru slier and nothing more, cannot hope tel accomplish the
trick.
# * *
Charley Dunn, recently defeated by Greedon, is,
ib’spite his enormous strength, not cutout fora pugilist,
lie is too heavy for a middleweight, and has not reach or
height enough to meet a goal big man. In this respect
lie is somewhat like .L in Smith. D spite his nuggety
build gu | weight Ditt.ii is very.active, ami lias shown good
foim as a sprinter.

A well-known trotting-horse owner, when
twitted about the “ crank ” state of the sport in Sydney,
remarked that the present style of handicapping is the
whole cause of the trouble. Be that as it may, trotting-

Riseliill, Moorefield and Warwick Farm, do not place
valuable trotting fixtures on their programmes.

former won’t stand spurs when an extra effort is required

looked like pulling ojR the open Hurdle Race until Kim-

declined to consider the matter any further.

Grand Duke Alexis of Russia telegraphed to
the Epsom stewards to postpone the Derby for an hour
because he had missed his train. However, this was t o
large an order for even a body of “Turf Tories’’(and
snobbery is very rife in the racing world) to execute, so
the Grand Duke arrived just in time to find that he had
backed a loser. The incident is interesting. It shows
how the effusive “ loyalty ” of the Londoners who go wild
over anything with a big foreign handle to its name had
persuaded Alexis that the Derby was being specially got
up for his entertainment.

Three years ago Redleap was the deadest of
“ dead birds” for the Flcmington G.N. Steeplechase, but
the gelding hurt his foot after winning the Hurdle Race
and had to he scratched. Eaglet, however, proved good
enough to complete Miller’s “double,” and so the
stable got there all the same without exposing the fact
that “ big ” jumping Was Redleap’s/orfe. In 18S9 as in
1892 the Steeplechase was the event that Dante’s son
had been specially prepared for. The Hurdle was
his preliminary canter, so to speak. Perhaps he
was a trifle faster at four years of age than
he is now, but, anyway, a horse that could
run clean away from Corythus (who subsequently
put up a record for a mile on the flat) must be a
phenomenon amongst jumpers of both classes when
thoroughly well. And the Millers, having got then-
horse well, only wanted to see him win the Hurdle ra -e
again to feel confident that they held a mortgage on the
Steeple which was to have been Redleap’s second bite in
’B9. How patient these rich people can afford to be !

In half-crown sweeps, got up among friends, a

when Assyrian won the Melbourne Cup, and so obtained
the needful to set him up in his present business.

ami has proved a distinct success.

It is strange that none of the placed horses in the
Flemington Grand National Steeplechase (Redleap, Confi-

on that course before ; while horses like Jack’s the Lad,

been jumped there previously, fell at different periods of
the race.

Tim Griffo-Barron fight ended in a draw, much
to the disgust of a large audience, after 21 rounds. Griffo,
weighing 9st. lib., and giving away 121b5., was very much

This young man w ill probably be a physical wreck within
a year or two. The other man couldn't hit him he got
heavily home on the Rocks champiqp's nose once —and
Griffo had him dazed once or twice but lacked strength to
follow up and finish him.

A REAL MAN OF MARK.
“ Herr Rassmussen’s Cures are so remarkable that we
make no apology for referring to some of them. Air. Rams-
den’s case is the most wonderful, and his remedies cured him
in six weeks, afttr m; ny Sydney doctors gave Li n up. We
may also state that a gentleman in this district, who has
been a martyr to the demon Dyspepsia for more than two
years, after trying several “ doctors ” with no benefit what-
ever, is recovering under Herr Rassmussen’s Herbal
Remedies. Herr Rassmussen possesses undoubted skill, and
we wish him a long life to continue his useful mission in the
cause of suffering humanity.”—Kangaroo Valley Pioneer,

A JUST REWARD.
“Herr Rassmussen, of whose famous Herbal Remedies
everybody has heard, has held the position of Lecturer to
several Botanic Societies in Australia; he soon became
known by the wonderful cures effected by his remedies, of
which he has numerous tokens of gratefulness, including a
beautiful Gold Medal, brought him into the front rank of
botanic ."dentists. We have seen and examined letters from
all parts of the world —are assured that he has saved a world
of suffering and cured people of many complaints, after they
bad given up all hope.”— The Australian Workman.

WHO IS RASSMUSSEN ?
“ Herr Rassmussen is a wonder. We have sufficient
proof that his Remedies have cured thousands. He was
awarded a Gold Medal for his Alfalino Remedies, and he is
■author of some valuable Medical Works. We hope ho will
be as successful in Victoria as he has been in New South

The Fact of the Matter.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I’m wonderin’ why those? fellers who go huildin’
chipper ditties,
’Bout the rosy times out drovin’, an’ the dust an’
death of cities,
Don’t sling the bloomin’ office, strike some drover
for a billet,
And soak up a.l the glory that comes handy while
they fill it.
P’r’aps it’s fun to travel cattle or to picnic with
merinos,
But the drover don't catch on, sir, not much high-
class rapture he knows.
As for sleepin’ on the plains there in the shadder
of the spear-grass,
That's liked best by the Juggins with a spring-bed
an’ a pier-glass.
An’ the camp fire, an’ the freedom, and the blanky
constellations,
The ’possum-rug an’ billy, an’ the togs an’ stale
ole rations—
It’s strange they’re only raved about by coves that
dress up pretty,
An’ sport a wife, an’ live on slap-up tucker in the
city.
I've tickled beef in my time clear from Clarke to
Riverina,
An’ shifted sheep all round the shop, but blow
me if I've seen a
Single blanky hand who didn’t buck at pleasures
of this kidney,
And wouldn’t trade his blisses for a flutter down
in Sydney.
Night-watches are delightful when the stars are
really splendid
To the chap who’s fresh upon the job, but, you
bet, his rapture's ended
When the rain comes down in sluice-heads, or the
cuttin’ hailstones palter,
An’ the sheep drift off before the wind, an’ the
horses strike for shelter.
Don’t take me for a howler, but I find it come
annoyin’
To hear these fellers rave about the pleasures we’re
enjoyin’,
When p’r’aps we’ve nothin’ better than some fluky
water handy,
An’ they’re right on all the lickers—rum, an’
plenty beer an’ brandy.
The town ig dusty, may be, but it isn’t worth the
curses
’Side the dust a feller swallers an’ the blinded
thirst he nurses
When he’s on the hard macadam, where the jum-
bueks cannot browse, an’
The wind is in his whiskers, an’ he follers twenty
thousan’.
This drovin’on the plain, too, it’s all O.K. when
the weather
Isn’t hot enough to curl the soles right off your
upper leather,
Or so cold that when the mornin’ wind comes hissin’
through the grasses
You can feel it cut your eyelids like a whip-lash
as it passes.
Then there’s bull-ants in the blankets, an’ a lame
horse, an’ muskeeters.
An’ a D.T. boss like Halligan, or one like Humpy
Peters,
Who is mean about the tucker, an’ can curse from
start to sundown,
An’ can fight like fifty devils, an’ whose growler’s
never run down.
Yes, I wonder why the fellers what go buildin’
chipper ditties
’Bout the rosy times out drovin’ an’ th’ dust an’
death of cities,
Don’t sling the bloomin’ office, strike ole Peters
for a billet,
An’ soak up all the glory that comes handy while
they fill it.

The Wild-Cat Column.
The Garibaldi mine at Hillgrove is worked Dr
gold and antimony. It has had a struggling existence
for years. Fred. Clissold, lately deceased, dropped his
monev in it. The present owners appear lo be buoyed up
hy a statement made by the late N.S.W. Government
geologist—“ That as depth is attained, the antimony will
lessen and the gold increase.” With all respect to Mr.
Wilkinson’s judgment, this is hy no means the rule, and
one need not go beyond Hillgrove itself lo see it. Hill-
grove is bounded by two great gorges, 1600 ft. deep, and
the Garibaldi mine is on the tableland between them.
There is comparatively little antimony in Hie Baker s
Creek or*Sunlight lodes, which are in one gorge, hut in
the other, the lodes contain as great a percentage of anti-
mony at the bottom of the gorge as on the surface.
# # #
The S.M. Herald “ Mining Notes ” are, at any
rate, as a rule, written with care, and Hie writer, in (he
absence of judgment, seldom praises or condemns any,-
thing, consequently the appearance of the statement that
(here are thousands of tons of gold-bearing ore exposed in
Hie Pamhula tunnel mine awaiting some efficient method
of treating fine gold, is a slaggerer. It is what one might
expect in a manager’s report, from which possibly it lias
been taken. “Awaiting a more economical mode of
treatment” is an old familiar “ wheeze.” What is wanted
in many cases is a process which will reduce rocks to the
fineness of flour, separate every particle of visible or
invisible gold, collect every grain of pyrites, ana take the
gold therefrom, and do it all for a few shillings a ton ; or,
better still, make up any deficiency of gold in the ore.
# # *
It is reported that in washing away some 200
loads from the tail-race over 12ozs. of gold were got from
the Spa sluicing claim. The return seems Lo be too good
to lie true. Anyhow, it is very unreasonable to imagine
that old John Wallace, with all his sluicing experience,
would tackle an expenditure of over £30,000 before getting-
an ounce of gold unless he knew’ what he was going for.
# * *
Occasionally a stray newspaper paragraph
informs the public that the Homeward Bound claim, at
Yalwal, N.S.W., continues to give good yields of gold, but
the real figures are never submitted. Why don’t the
Government, as owners, compel lessees to give publicity
to their yields? This mine was profitably worked for
many years by the former owners, who are said to have
raised £30,000 worth of gold, but, as their returns were
never published, few knew of its existence, and fewer of
its location. It was then purchased for £19,000 cash by
the present ow’ners, w ho have passed through much tribu-
lation, mads up of law-suits and low-grade ore. It seems
to he in gold what White Rock is iu silver-a network of
irregularly-defined veins, which cannot he raised without
quarrying the entire body.
* * *
Big things are predicted for Bendigo in the near
future. The cool-headed Bendigo miner, if he speaks the
truth, w ill admit that these sudden spurts occasioned hy
wonderfully-improved yields have occurred periodically
for the last 20 years. As a rule, every month two or
three mines, either hy the opening up of a new lift or the
extension of a crosscut into new country strike fresh
makes of gold, and when it happens that half-a-dnzen
minees do this simultaneously instead of one after the
0 her, then theie is a temporary boom sometimes lasting
half a year, during which new spapers make asses of them-
selves and fool the public. The only feature about the
Bendigo boom that distinguishes it from others, is the
fact that two well-known lines of reef have been con-
siderably extended.

The plant of the Ironclad mine, Cargo, N.8.W.;
has been sacrificed. It was worked by an English Co.,
and who worked the company Heaven only knows. After
spending many thousands in machinery, including a
chlorination plant, and other thousands in development,
the mine has been abandoned. The goal is largely
associated with copper. At times the show was run at a
profit, it was said, hut no figures are available.
*" * *
The Golden Clad is situated in its vicinity.
The “ Turf Attorney-General “ Yorkshireman ”—w ho
recently died, owned the concern, and, although he never
said it, made it his Golden Calf, lie swore by assays
made of carefully-selected ■ stone,' and in his. wild
enthusiasm dropped much m we.v. He sent three prac-
tical men to inspect whose warnings lie refused to accept.
It is reported that something worth working has at last
been found on the mine.
# # * #
Will anybody say that the Pambnla gold-mine
has not had a fair amount of booming? For nearly two
years we have boen told of worn!-i ful assays, of rich firsts
aid accumulated seconds. Now the Mining Standard
has the cheek to say of it, “ It seems odd that those who
have confidence in the mine do not keep it a Utile more
before the public.”
# * *
The manager of the Nambncca (N.S, Wales)
niin * recently announced that he intended clean-
ing up in a fortnight and then declaring a dividend.
Another disappointment. Toe \ bid is said to he a lit lie
ever 200 ozs. from 70 tons of slonc. The yield and out-
put are small—certainly 100 small for any dividei d.
Accounts respecting this yield are vciy conflicting. One
report describes a big eseoD with the bars of gold, the
weight of which was kept dark, but some enthusiastic
K n'nseyites were allowed to handle one and judged it to
weigh 200 ozs. Another gives that as the total yield. It
\i ; ,.i > said that the erection of the chlorination works
contin tes a heavy lax on the prep rty. All that we
know of it is tint it is rich in a f w places and poor in
others.

Compared with corresponding weeks of previous
years, the returns of Sydney Omnibus end Tramway Go.
have fallen over £lOO per week. As a result, sharehi filers
who had been drawing 12. J and 10 per cent, for the money
1 ivested in this big carrying concern, will probably have,
this year, to he content with eight, and drivers, grroau
and other employes hive (of cours ;) to face a reduction of

The Parliaments of Australia will stain find it
necessary to enquire into the working of Australian insur-
ance companies, bogus and otherwise. Many are only
enabled to weather the storm because pol cy-holdeis can-
not withdraw. In building s ci.ty hanks, people risked
the principal for the sake of big interest, hut insurance,
being the least speculative form of iiivestm nt, should
receive it ong State protection. All assurance offices

Melbourne Hkb.\:d now under the spiritual
guidance of parson Fitohett, Campbell, and James Balfour,
naturally holds a brief for Matthew Davies and Munro,
In fact, the Argus is the only Melbourne daily that calls
a spade an agricultural implement these times.
# * *
Whenever the Victorian Government diamond-
drills discover anything of any consequence the dist rict is
invariably in the hands of a fat syndicate which is never
heard of till the numbers are up. Remarkable also that
the Melbourne papers never howl about any particular
field for investment till the whole country-side is grabbed
hy the large speculators, and they are offering the chances
to a hungry public at an “ enormous sacrifice.”

Some Chinese, working for a European gold-
mine owner, at Port Darwin, N.T., came across a golden
leader, said to run lib. weight of gold to each bucket of
stone. They held a chin-chin, carefully covered up all
traces of work, and interviewed their employer as to
securing a tribute of part of his claim. But the Aladdin’s-
cave yarn had been whispered by every wind, and the
employer refused. Again and again Hie Chinkies tried to
drive a bargain ; again and again were they repelled.
When at last they saw the boss was adamant, they retired
for a final confab. Then, their spokesman returned and
said—“ You lefuse offec tliboot; all li. You welly ole
man; I young man. You die soon ; I gettee gole all li.
You no can find ’im. I wait: by Vhy, you die ; I gettee
all li. So long!” And the European has not found the
gorgeous pocket, though he has spent months in searching
for it.

which were found in the pockets of M'Namara (who is
also awaiting tiiai) when the latter person was arrested.
One of these purported to be a copy of a letter written
hy M'Namara to Abigail, about 15 months ago, in which
that gentleman addresses his boss as follows: “Perhaps ,
it would not be out of place to mention just now the fact
that £35,431 15s. was taken out of the hank’s cotters hy
former directors, and £17,736 15s. 2d. by the presentbcaid.
I will now leave you to judge for yourself, at the same
time answer your own question. I have before me at this I
moment the particulars of these amounts, consequently I I
cannot refrain from stating that the details are sufficiently I
sickening to make even the most hardened ruffian blush. I (
may also mention at this stage that Mr. Bull is not as
black as he is painted. If he is, well, when he sees Hie
matter now before me lie will certainly turn pure
w hile. My adv ice to you at the present is this;
1 Don’t allow the drama to become too ludicrous ,
before my return to the bank.’ ” Also, there are sundry
hideously ungrammatical letters from Abigail, in one of
which he observes that when Hie Bill passes authorising
the ancient pawnshop to become a hauls, of issue, and
more capital is obtained, *‘a complete change will have s
to be made in the arrangements ; ” and no less than three |
certificates signed by Abigail attesting that the securities (
are perfectly correct, and “largely in excess of Hie value j
of the amounts obtained against them.” It was after
these documents were signed that M'Namara declared the
details of the management were “ sufficiently sickening
to make the most hardened ruffian blush.” Apparently ‘
the Australian Banking Co. was not a happy, family. |
According to the evidence, one of the directors was last ■
heard of sleeping in a sixpenny bed at the Model Lodging
House. He ought to be an interesting man if he could be 1
found, and it is lo lie hoped the liquidators will have a
look round the Domain for him.

By section 11, sub-section 11, of the Trades
Disputes Conciliation and Arbitration Act, the Bioken
Hill strikers have power to lodge aaapplication with Hie
Clerk of Awards requesting that the dispute be referred
to a council of conciliation. The other side refusing to
join then the council of conciliation have power to
report that they have been unable to secure a settlement of
the dispute. That stage reached, the miners may request
the Clerk of Awards (sec. 12) to refer the matter to the
council of Arbitration. Of course, nothing will be done,
but tills procedure will show up the weak spots in the
capitalistic refusal to come to an agreement.

Some months ago a leading Maori land
coal mining company gave notice of a reduction of
wages. The men kicked and formed a union, and
the notice was withdrawn. Shortly afterwards a sudden
increase of trade necessitated the starting of another shift
and men were engaged for that purpose. Eight or nine
weeks afterwards the trade as suddenly decreased, and 113
men were discharged—nearly all of them being unionists.

It is on record that the authorities of the
Sydney building society to which Mr. Fogarty, now of
South America, vvasdately attached, were careless or coin-
passionate enough to allow that gentleman leg-bail

Hie society’s accounts yet been dissected hy a cold-
blooded, cynical accountant ?

A few weeks ago. the Commercial Agency,
Trading and Banking (Jo., of Sydney, went on a reef, and
—under the new Act for the relief of sinking hanks—got
three years to settle up. The terms were exceptionally
favourable for the hank, inasmuch as only 40 per cent, of
the liabilities were to be paid in the first two years, the
remaining 60 per cent, coming due in the third year.
Now a large ticket in Hie bank window announces that
fixed deposits are received at usual rates, and that
interest is allowed on current accounts, &c. There-
fore it would he interesting to know if the court
which sanctioned the arrangement with the old
depositors can make any effectual provision whereby
the old deposits and the new ones will be kept separate,
for it they both go into one common account, and if the
hank should, by any chance, go aground again—say in the
third year—then the new deposits must, hy Hie ordinary
process of book-keeping, go in paying off the old ones.
If there isn’t enough money to go round, the man whose
deposit falls due first has the best show, and the person
who puts in his cash now, for three years, obviously doesn’t
get a chance till almost all the old liabilities are paid off—
these same liabilities which the company couldn’t,meet
when they fell dive a little while ago. Further, it would
he interesting lo know if the framers of the-Act ever
contemplated that a company-which h-.d to get an exten-
sion of time upon its old deposits should at once start to
take in new ones; and if there is any definite provision in
Hie Act whereby Hie new depositor shall he informed,
before lie puts his money in, of the fact that the old ones
aren’t paid.

We have received a glaring prospectus of the
Ivesfm’s and Dlhcin s (juartz Mining Co., Daylesford
(Vie.) which sets forth, in.a general sort of way, that the
mine is going to be the grandest c.once.rn on earth. Also,
there is a portrait of the legal manager, and a Inief
biography of him as follows: “ Your legal manager,
whom you see before y on, is Mr. Thomas Price, of Frank-
linford, Daylesford ami C istloniaine, who is known far
. and wide as one of the greatest, managers of No-Liahility
Companies in Austialia. Everything he lakes in hand is
a success to the share’ old vis. His connection with
Victoria is 33 years, and 25 of that connected with muni-
cipalities handling thousands of pounds, which is a
guarantee that everything will he carried out honestly
and straightforwardly. Let every person who has the
interest of the colony at heart try his luck, and induce
Ids neighbours also. No roguery or trickery carried on
with the shares. Your legal manager will see lo that.
Nothing hut the dividends will he go in for. Your legal
manager is a great man. Look at the Devonshire mine,
(Jastlcinaiiie, that he stalled two years ago without a
shilling. He has to-dav one of Hie host companies in
Australia. A good list of shareholders and £2OO to their
credit in the hank. Not, a shilling liabilities, and
machinery capable of sinking to a depth of 1000 feet. He
will make Hie above mine equally as good.—(Signed)
Thomas Price, manager.” It isn’t every man who has
the gall to sign Ida name to his own biography in this
fashion. Perhaps—happy thought!—it isn’t every mining
manager who feels that his reputation will hear such a
strain.

Ballarat wants the Government to drain Sebas-
topol plateau, and Bendigo has an axe to grind. The
shafts of Lansell’s ISO mine, the Pandora, and Hustler’s
have each reached 2000 feet and over in depth, and are in
a direct line Fast and West on the three main lines of
reef. Bendigo men think the Government ought to
undertake driving cross-cuts from one shaft to another at
a good depth, when it is certain innumerable unknown
reefs would be intersected. The Bendigo field is a net-
work of reefs, though only three main lines are worked.

The recent sale of the Kentish mine was owing
to the trustees of Millionaire .I. H. Watson’s estate refus-

The price realised by selling to the adjoining Co., the

machinery on the ground. The bulk of Watson s fortune
came from the Iventish, out of which he took 24 tons of
gold.

One man up North managed to get level with
the Mount Morgan gang. He had bought shares fairly
cheap, and when they stood at £l4 he started to growl
about them in the presence of some of Hie biggest share-
holders and some talkative outsiders one night in a
champagney atmosphere. P.y dint of incessant nagging
he huffed one or two of the crowd, one of whom, a, very
big man indeed, at, last asked him if he would lake £l4
for his shares. “Pooh!” said the holder, “£lll as 4
you or any of your crowd would dare to give £l4 ! The
big man, in a Vomer, said it- was « Ir-egahi, - whereupon
the holder instantly got his signature to a contract-note.

There is talk of challenging the authorities of

Tales of the Riverine.
IN PUGGA MILLY REACH,
(F OR THE BULLETIN.)
Big, burly Tom M'Grundy, with the thirst
of a sponge, features of a red, red rose, the heart of
an angel, and the financial genius of a Wilkins
Micawber—his I.O.XJ.’s and P.N.’s would have
covered the Old Man Plain with a pavement of
tesselatcd indebtedness—drove up to the boats as
they were raising steam for the trip to Echuca.
They had dropped down from the wharves over-
night and had tied up at the south bank of the
Murrumbidgee, just below the bend in the stream
where the 150-acre police paddock runs into
Mungadel station. Both the steamers—the Jessie
Jane and the Resolution —were under M‘Grundy’s
agency, and while there was no dodge that Mac.
could not work to steal a march upon an opposing
firm—the ring yet with the way he “did”
M'Cullooh’s Hay manager (Fehon, present
N.S.W. Railway Commissioner, was boss of the
big concern then) out of ,£2OOO worth of wool
freight- he was studiously just to the several
owners he represented. He tapped them for loans
and drinks with equal impartiality, and he gave
the “little” men with the one cranky steamer
and a solitary crazy barge the same show for
Cutting a plummy slice out of the rich cake of the
season’s wool-traffic as he did the bigger man who
Had half-a-dozen steamers and twice as many
barges. No flunkeyish, kiss-his-hand favouritism
to the well-in owner was ever shown by Tom
M'Grundy, and it would have been better for the
small men on the rivers had all the agents and
managers followed his lead.
The Jessie Jane was a small man’s craft
skippered by its owner and under the double dis-
advantages of carrying with its cargo an
eternally-on-the-eve-of-going-to-blazes boiler and
a tremendous mortgage; while the Resolution
belonged to a man who was being helped literally
by a bank, and who, though bound to go under
some time like all bank-made creatures—some
day, I’ll x-ecite certain legends of a Riverina bank-
sweating room—would be “on top” for five
seasons or so. Therefore, Tom M‘Grundy would,
without doubt, have found it in the long run
much more to his own profit had he favoured the
Resolution. But that was not his way of doing
business.
As he drew rein on the sandy hummock he
hailed the craft which the freshet was jostling
restlessly against one another. The gilded, brassy
Resolution, with barge lashed a-beam, lay astern i
of the beggarly Jessie Jane that looked as if the 1
current half-year’s interest on the mortgage now ]
just due would sink her to the bottom of the i
river; and the big boat now and then stuck her
nose more viciously into her shabby rival as 1
though she would smash her from very contempt. '
The Resolution and her barge were carrying
twelve hundred bales of “way back” clips, and i
the tarpaulined pile towered majestically over the 1
four hundred, which were all the Jessie and her ]
barge were permitted by stern Tummy Freeman, ]
the Echuca representative of the Melbourne (
Underwriters’ Association, to load up with.
The contrast betw'een the two crafts was so 1
forcible that even unreflective Tom Mac. was i
struck by it, and hesitated, after hailing, as to t
whether it would not, as a mere matter of business,
be the better policy to give the commission direct c
to the Resolution instead of making it a subject of
competition. Before he could decide, however,
slim Jim Barton, owner and master of the Jessie
•lane, was clambering up the bank in response to
his call.
“ ’Morning, Mr. Mac. ! What’s up? Anything
fresh ?”
“ ’Morning, Jim. Yes; there’s a fresh freight
offering, but I am going to give you and the
Resolution the chance of it. It will all depend
upon who can get to Echuca first and back to
Mungadel !”
“Oil, racing !” Jim’s face, which had lit up
with the agent’s first words, lost its aspect of
animation. “ I’m not on. I can’t race, and I am
not going to run risks of that sort.”
“ Well,” said sympathetic Mac., “ ’tisn't exactly
a race, Jim. But, look here, wait till that lazy
lubber of a Linton comes. Damn ! You’d think
that chap was commodore of the Pacific squadron,
he puts on so much side ! Now, Linton —I say
Linton, Skipper Linton ! Hurry up, man !”
“ Aye, aye, Mr. M'Grundy—l’m coming ! ’ and,
slowly as became the master of the dashingest new
boat on the rivers—not (o mention his antecedents
as an officer of Money-Wigram’s line —he walked
from his state-room —they were “state-rooms ” on
the Resolution and “ cabooses ” on the Jessie Jane
—to the gangway. There he stopped.
“Breakfasted, Mr. M‘Grundy ?” he drawled.
<( “No,” growled the agent, losing patience.
“ But I’m just going to have a bite with Barton
here. I want to see you first—look sharp! ”
And while the dandy of the boating trade was
digesting the unceremonious speech in his slow
walk, Mac. turned to Barton and said: “Can’t
stand his damned nonsense, Jim, so I’ll take a bit
with you, if you don’t mind.”
_ “Very welcome, of course, Mr. Mac., but I can’t
give you ham and chicken and wine, you know.
We’ve only salmon and tea.” And Jim laughed.
“‘Better,’as Solomon says, ‘tinned fish and
billy tea where no side is than a French dinner with
show and bounce,’” said M‘Grundy, and then, as
Captain Linton drew near, he communicated his
news.
“ Look here, chaps, after you dropped down last
night Tom Lang, of Mungadel, came to me. He
says by the time you get to Echuca GO tons of
Ryland’s wire ought to be there. Now, it’s a
matter of the first importance that he should get
it here within a fortnight. It’s for his back
country, and he can get teams now for next to
nothing, and if he misses the chance, it’s all up
with his back country improvements for a year.”
“ Well,” broke in Linton, as Mao. stopped for
breath, “M'Culloch’s Lang’s agents—they can
run it down easily ! ”
“ That’s just it. They say they can’t. They’re
rather cocky and say wire-loading must wait their
boats’ convenience, and there’s a rush of higher-
priced freight, and they won’t take more wire than
makes a fair proportion of dead-Weight.”
“ That’s the case with everybody,” said Linton,
“unless,” he added, superciliously, “it suits
Barton here.”
“All right, Dick Linton, if you turn up your
nose at a good thing before you know what it is,
that’s your own look-out. If I hadn’t promised
Mr. Lang to put the proposal before you both, i
I'm blest if I wouldn’t give it Jim straight.”
Grundy was getting nettled.
“Well,” said Linton, now scenting something
beneath the surface, “ I don't see as there can be i
much in it for anybody when the big firm say no i
to it.”
“Ah, but the big firm haven’t had the chance i
of saying no to what I offer you two. Lang’s i
E temper's up and he’ll give special terms to got this
, wire here in the time.”
s “ What are they ?”
• “ Double rates for the wire, 30 tons Ballarat
chaff—must be Ballarat, if you can pick it up at
■ Echuca when you’re there without waiting— at six
ten—that ought to give you a couple of pounds a
ton profit—and ” He paused to give a rheto-
rical effect to his next sentence.
“ Well, don’t be all day, Mac, Time’s slipping
along !” said Linton.
“ All his lading down and up for this and the
next season !”
“By George, those are grand terms, Mr. Mac.,”
exclaimed Barton. “He must want that wire
badly.”
“He does. You see he’ll save about six
pounds per ton in back loading, and Heaven
knows how much by getting his back-blocks
fenced in before next year; besides, there’s the
dishing of M‘Culloch. That’s worth something
to a cove like Lang, who makes money himself
out of other people’s necessities.”
“But, Mr. Mac., what have we to do? Do we
get the loading between us?” questioned the Jessie
Jane’s skipper.
’ No, that’s not it. The first boat of you two
ready to take it from the cranes at Echuca wharf
has the whole contract. That’s the offer !”
The two skippers eyed each other. Barton, for
the life of him, could not prevent the blood rushing
into his cheeks, at the thought that, if he could
only pull off this job, what a tremendous difference
it would make to his fortunes. Linton’s personal
interest in the prospective achievement was not so
large as Barton’s, but it was still great. It would
only mean a big commission, but it would be
something to talk about. “How I did M'Culloch’s
out of the Mungadel contract ” would be a tale
that would tell well when conversing the next
time with the inspector of the Bank of Australia
Felix, who was finding the capital for the new
steamer-line to which the Resolution belonged.
Linton did not care much for monev, except as it
enabled him to play “the swell,” but he was as
vain as a peacock or a poet—Lord ! he’d be some-
body on the rivers if he could snatch the Munga-
del clip from the maw of the big firm. Who
knows but that, perhaps, the bank-inspector would
suggest that Linton be made commodore of the
new line, or perhaps build a boat—a regular clipper
it should be —for him ! And so, realising in a Hash
of thought all the offer involved, he jumped at it.
“I’m on, Mr. M‘Gnmdy ! I’ll do it if you’ll
■give me the order,” he said.
“No, Lang says I’m not to bind myself to either
boat. A fair field, he says, and no tricks, and it’s
as open to the Jessie as to the Resolution.”
“Oh ! but,” interjected Linton, “you’re out of
it from the start, Barton. Look at my haulage
power over .yours.”
“Look at your load to mine ! ” retorted Barton.
“You know what old Freeman said? It’s the
gossip of all the Riverine when he last surveyed
y°u. He said that if you put pressure on the
Jessie’s boiler—and you survived—he’d get your i
license cancelled. And without your license you
can’t insure, and without insurance much freight i
you’ll have !” Linton showed his dfsire for the i
contract by the bitterness of his sneer.
“ Well, ’ retorted Barton, “if the Jessie does
blow up, she’ll only kill six, and not sixty !”
A mighty guffaw from M'Grundy expressed his ;
appreciation, of Barton’s remark, and the angry
colour in Linton’s cheeks was other testimony to ]
its force. Barton had referred to a grim River i
tradition that Linton had had Ids mate’s certifi- i
cate cancelled by the Board of Trade because of -
i his running down in the English Channel a Greek
vessel with sixty lives on board. r I here were
at this time a score of “seagoing” officers
engaged in the river-trade—two or three (including
-Linton) m commands, several more as mates, most
as deck hands. One of two reasons—often the
two combined usually explained why these
manners had left the rolling wave for the river.
Ihink or disaster, if it were not drink and
disaster—one or the other, or one and the other.
And the suspicion of past failure being upon these
sons of the salt sea, they were not beloved or
admired by the Croweaters, and Cornstalks, and
Gumsuckers, who, with an ex-Mississipian or two,
bossed the river-craft 14 to 20 years ago.
Men to the rivers born were never tired of re-
peating how C ,of the Princess, whose certifi-
cates (in their uncancelled state) should have ob-
tained for him command of an Atlantic liner
hauled up at xiiidday at Pental Island. The river
was shallowing rapidly-five feet at Albury, 15 at
Jiichuca, and 10 at Swan Hill —and as every
moment was precious the mate objected. “ Wot
d’yer want stopping here for, shipper ?” “Oh ! ”
G > “I’m going to take an observation.
1 here’s no latitude or longitude marked on the
chart. “ II—1,” cried the mate, “ wot d’yer want
longtitood and latitood for? Ain’t yer got that
blawsted box yonder by the woodpile to steer by ?”
And the roar with which the anecdote was ever
welcomed, defined the precise degree of deprecia-
tion in which the “ocean-going” chaps were re-
garded by the river men proper.
Now, Barton was a Croweater, had been born on
the Lower Murray in the very year (’53) that
Cadeli had taken up the Lady'Augusta, and he
had grown up with the boat-trade. Consequently,
he was not predisposed to look upon Linton with
the friendliest eyes, and when he understood that
Linton was resolved to achieve the Mungadelcon-
tract, the getting of which would alter his
(Barton’s) whole career materially for the better,
he would have been more than human had he
refrained from meeting taunt with taunt. But,
to tell the truth, he felt for the moment that the
prize was as good as lost when he-saw how Linton
writhed under his retort, for then he knew that
neither fair nor foul means would be spared by the
Resolution’s skipper to get the job. To a man who
would not fight fair there were lots of ways open
of impeding a competitor for a cargo. A
pushed surreptitiously into a stevedore’s hand had
more than once led to the sinking of a barge as it
lay loaded beneath the cranes at Echuca wharf.
There was that Cumberoona epusode, when Harry
Clifton was ’Chuca manager for M‘Cullocb’“ -but
it must be a story for another time.
* * *
When M‘Grundy’s laugh had exhausted
itself, Linton, looking like a thunder-cloud, said ;
‘‘And what’s to be your share of the bunce,
M‘Grundy?”
The agent meditated for a second. Should it
be a p.n. at three months? —Mac.’s p.n. at three
days after Doomsday would have been negotiable
' or , there was that bay pony Tom Palmer, of
Caroon, had offered him for a song, cash ? Which
should it be? At last—
“ Usual agency charges, boys—no more; but
you know there’s a nice litt’e pony hack Tom
Palmer has—l wouldn’t refuse that from either of
you as an unofficial present, boys--”
“x\ll right, Mr. Mac., if I get the job,
ponys yours,” said Barton, and Linton also
acquiesced, but with sullenncss. It was well
enough for that fellow Barton to promise a bonus
when he ran no risk of being called upon to pay

it, but Linton thought he’d be dashed if he’d a
promised it if it had been left to himself, after the
way M’Grundy had laughed at him.
And so it was arranged. First under the
’Chuca cranes, ready to take in the wire, was to
have the whole Mungadel business for the just
opening season and the following year as well,
And when, after a hurried breakfast in the shabby
little cabin of the Jessie Jane, he hurriedly shook
hands with Barton, he fervently hoped the little
’un would pull the game off. “It’ll make you,
Jim, if you do,” he exclaimed.
-ry
Three days afterwards the boats were at
Swan Hill together. What the big boat gained
during the day she lost during the night.
Jim knew the river intimately, while the
skipper of the Resolution had to find his course
by the rude charts of the river men, and not being
backed by a life acquaintance with the char-
acteristics of the stream, he was often in a tangle.
When he found himself—as frequently happened
—gingerly steering through deep water where the
chart showed a sand-spit he had always a fear that
he might find a sand-spit calmly embracing a snag
where the paper marked 10 or 12 feet of water,
He was under the necessity accordingly of tying
up at nightfall. Jim, on the other hand, ran as
long as he could at night without breaking down
his engineer and fireman, while the man who
(assuming his certificates were all right) could have
taken a Cunarder from Mersey to Sandy Hook,
or brought out a P. and O. mail-boat from South-
hampton to Melbourne, was compelled to grin and
bear the sting as best he might when the Jessie,
which he had passed hours before, returned the
compliment after nightfall. The three sharp
whistles with which the Jessie would greet him
sounded saucily, and her exhaust, he could have
sworn, cheeked him. And, if those mechanical
insults were not sufflcient he would be compelled
to hear wordy taunts that incurably hurt his
vanity.
“ Skipper !” would sing out all the bargemen as
the Jessie Jane came abreast of the Resolution,
“blest if that ain’t Toff Linton’s boat! What’s
he waitin’ for?”
Jim would maintain a decent silence. Then the
bargeman would answer himself.
“ He’s hopin’surely as the moon’ll rise soon as
he can take the long’tood !”
Then the deck hands would join in ; “ No, that
’tain't it. He’s waitin’ for the dew to fall, so ho
can get some way on her.”
“You're wrong, all o’ y T ou,” would now inter-
ject the mate. “His crew’s struck—he war
pilotin’ the boat up the billabong backwater.”
“Ga-arn,” another rouseabout would sneer.
“He’s an appintment with Black Nell at the
Melool wood-pile, an’ he carn’t wax his moustache
while the boat’s a-steamin’, so he ties up.”
So the jokers of the river would dash their
humours against the sides of his cabin. Their
joking had the additional bitterness for Linton
that it was never answered by his own men. An
impressive characteristic of the river was that
the men of a boat were loyal to their skipper, as a
rule. Let the skipper be trying to make a point in
a trio, or to score off a rival—either by coarse
chaff qr sheer rapid steaming—and they would
help him with lung and limb, forfeit for him their
sleep and their meal-time, or even effect that most
precious of sacrifices, the abandonment of their
“ between-trip-sprees.” And when his men did
not champion a skipper through good report and
through ill report, and back him up in straight
river reaches and over the moral snags, generally
of the feminine order, that were always in readi-
ness on the shore to wreck any boat-chap, you
might safely depend that the skipper
“white.” Now, Linton’s crew never “jawed
back” when the Jessie Jane’s fellows hurled their
jibes at the Resolution’s chief, and Linton had
been long enough in the trade to take that
fact as an emphatic condemnation in advance
of anything he might do. And, therefore,
being full of human nature, and not being
a saint out of the missionary books, he grew
venomous and as tyrannical as he dared.
Certainly he did not dare greatly ; democracy was
too substantial a thing on the rivers 20 years ago
to be assailed with impunity by a little, tinselled
god. It is flabbier now : boat-hands deputationise
the deity of the pilot-house now where, in the
seventies, they would have seen whether the
Murray a’Bidgee water wouldn’t have taken the
lace-frilled nonsense out of him.
When the boats, then, were at Swan Hill it
was an even chance which would get through
first at ’Chuca, and so gain the first shot at the
cranes. The Resolution with her superior power
would, without doubt, beat the Jessie by four
hours if there was clear daylight running all the
way, and it would be a remarkable thing indeed
if,'with that advantage, she could not win the
Mungadel job. But the four hours were just the
difference that the Jessie could make up by ivght
travel in the 21 to 30-hour-run from Castle
Donnington (Swan Hill) to Echuca. Thus honors
were easy.
Linton and Barton met at the township, just as
the latter had despatched the wire most boat-
masters sent thence to Echuca.
Barton cheerily nodded a “Morning,’’ which
Linton surlily acknowledged.
“ It’ll be nose and nose work, Captain Linton,”
said the Jessie’s skipper.
“ Bosh. You’re out of it. I’m not going to
race, either ! ”
“Nor I—fair heel-and-toe running—that’s what
I’m going to make of it.”
“ I’d not bother if I were you. Save your fuel
and the risk of a blow up !”
“Not a bit of it, old man. See the * state ’ at
Albury last Saturday?” And he pointed as he
spoke to a bit of blue paper pasted at the Post
Office, which recorded the state of the Murray
“ above Summer level.”
“Yes, 20 feet—what of that?”
“ That means, old man, you’re not going to get
past Puggamilly till that water comes down. I
know you scraped getting over the Bitch and
Pups!”
“ How the devil do you know that. By George!
If any of my men have been blabbing !”
“Keep your temper—none of ’em’s been
blabbing. But, man, you needn’t tell me you
didn’t scrape. When you’re down eight feet, and
the water on the reef is eight feet also, you've got
to scrape to get over. And you can’t warp over
Puggamilly. I can if I need to !—but I won’t!”
“ Very well,” and Linton turned to go, “think
as you please. Puggamilly, or no Puggamilly,
I’m going to run Mungadel stores up and down
for two seasCns.”
“Perhaps you may, Linton, if I give you a
billet on the new barge I shall build as soon as I
finger the cash for the freight on the Mungadel
wire now waiting for meat Echuca wharf.”
Having fired this shot, Jim Barton prepared to
send his telegram to the ’Chuca agents that he
was just clearing from the “ Hill.” As he handed
it in, and threw down the shilling, the operator
who had heard part of his conversation with
Linton, asked him if he was racing the Resolution.
In a few hurried words, Jim related the conditions
of the trip. “Wish you luck, Jim, I’m sure,”
said the operator as he pulled down the glass slide
of the pigeonhole. “If you get the Mungadel
work, it’ll be the making of you.”
The words stuck persistently to Jim. lorn
M'Grundy had said the same thing. His mate
kept on saying it; now the E.T.O. man who knew
everybody’s concerns on the river and whom every-
body knew, repeated it. As for himself, since he
had started he had been trying to forget how
much depended on the trip up to now. Doing his
best to win, he had yet freed himself from think-
ing of the prize. But the blessed words stuck, and
do what lie could he could not forget them.
It would be the making of him indeed ! And
as the Resolution dropped into the stream, and
the Jessie Jane followed her after a five minutes’
interval, Jim, answering the former’s horn with
his shrill whistle, felt, as he turned the whistle
cock, he was defying fortune as well as Linton’s
boat. The one thing that saves commerce from
infecting with leprous taint all that which she
touches is her alliance with the genius of home and
the spirits of the household. Where this is absent
how contemptible is trade—how degrading the
whole business of barter and speculation !
Now, Jim thirsted for gold, not to gratify his
vanity or the mere lust of getting, but in order to
obtain the means of enriching his own individual
life with the good things that life in general offers
to man. He wanted gold to win and keep a wife,
and to rear “an independent shed.’’ He wanted
the means to enjoy honourable leisure, and for
books, travel, anything that could make him a
stronger and more fruitful man. He had ambi-
tions, had this mallee, river-bred man, that were
not bounded by the mallee-rim on the south side
of the Murray, or by the box and gums on the
north bank. Inch-by-inch he had carved a path
upward; inch-by-inch he would mount higher
still —if the Rates pleased. If a man’s sinews and
a man’s thoughts could turn the sparse oppor-
tunities which offered, into gold, they should be
his. And here, right here, was the biggest chance
yet within the possibility of his grasp. Rail now,
and probably he would run a mortgaged boat
until Providence pleased that the boiler should
blow up with himself on board. Get the Mung-
adel contract, and through the long vista of
coming years he saw himself moving on from
success to success and from triumph to triumph-
first in the commercial world, and then—the
ambition was so sacred as to be no more than half
uttered to his own heart —in the political world.
Jim, ordinarily clear-headed enough, was yet at
this time so simple as to believe that politics had
some use for clean-souled men.
HI.
Every steamer’s “exhaust” to all river people
had its own message. Hitherto the Jessie Jane’s
escaping steam had had but one reading : “ Kiss
Jessie —Jim ! Kiss Jessie —Jim ! Kiss Jessie —
Jim !” That was the mode of it. But this morn-
ing there was a distinctly audible change.
Whether it was the rotten old boiler had taken a
new lease of life, or that some part of the engine
had gone wrong, or, having previously gone wrong,
was now determining to go right, or something
still more recondite and unexplainable ; but cer-
tainly the sibilation was no longer to be heard.
Jim noticed it as soon as he got into a fair way.
He called down the speaking-tube to the engineer.
“ Something wrong with the exhaust, Charlie.”
Charlie came up to the main deck. “ Yes,
skipper, she’s changed her toon. Steampipe’s got
a bit choked, I expect. \Vhat does she say ?
‘ Breakin’somethin,’it sounds like.”
Make you, break you—Jim ! Make you,
break you—Jim! that’s what it is, skipper,”
called the mate. “Well, that’s dashed funny,
isn t it r .
Very !’ replied J im, who was leaningover the
half-door of the pilot-house. And his heart
throbbed painfully as the alternative to being
made was voiced by the steam. Of course,
that was nonsense. If he did not get the Munga-
del contract, he would be no worse off than before,
And if he did well, bed be made. Mortgage
paid off ami open ciedit for a round thousand over-
draft at the bank. Then he would build a new
barge for next season and with the prestige of one
of the lug frontage station contracts behind him,
>o would no be dependant on agents’ mercies,
but won d tack e l alt-a_do7eback-blocks
stations himself. 1 nil off Mungadel, and he would
not change P aces with M Cullochs ! Ihe next
season would then see him worth three thousand
and all squarely earned, clean money. How many
of the river men would be able to say the same ?
By Heavens, he would have the contract And,
to cheer him, came another tune on the exhaust :
“Make you make you-Jmi.
That was it then ! Even the crazy old boat and
toiler were p ent u p on winning. Listen again 1
Make raa ke yoa —Jim.” Nothing more

But, „ the dusk ,va S rapidly ailing the
gaps between the clumps of gum on the banks,
and the only light on the stream was from the
great reflecting lamps ( already ablaze, the maie
seilt ) tlie half-fledged hobbledehoy, who acted as
cabin-boy for his keep, to wake the skipper. And
as Jim ran upstairs to. the pilot deck he heard
once more the fateful munnui, Make you, break

Joshes of light, il.ey were not from the lamps of
the Resolution and her barge, ihe big steamer
and her consort were tying up for the night on the
south bank, Linton having gone as far as he dared
that day. He hoped that the fresh water from
the Upper Murray would be down by day-
break to carry him oyer the shoal at the head
of the reach, and so avoid the necessity for warp-
ing the craft up by lines from the trees. If lie was
not compelled to warp he could (by putting on
another 10 pounds of steam) overtake the Jessie
Jane, and beat her through the Echuca port.
And as he put out his big lamps he cursed the
regulations which compelled him to aid in the
illumination of the reach. The more light in so
stiff a part of the river the better for his rival,
But the broad flashes, Jim noticed, were not

lamps. They were intermittent, now wavered by
the breeze, now blown by it into vivid, lightning-

interstices of the timber, and startled ducks and

And a figure was now seen in the blaze, and was
now hidden by it.
“Yes,” said Jim, “that’s a signal or else a
dodge. P’r’aps the Resolution has sent a man
there to trick us. Anyhow, if it’s a passenger,
we’re not going to take him.”
Eor, of course, if it were a passenger—and
would-be passengers emerged from the most uu-
likely places on the rivers—it must be a male.
None but a crank would have supposed a woman
would be there.

.
Yet, when the Jessie came abreast of the lower
point of Puggamilly- she took the inner channel
because of the lighter draught—Skipper Barton
saw that it was a woman who was standing by the
signal fire—a woman holding something in her
arms even when she stooped to throw another
branch of sapling on the flame.
“Jupiter,”, cried the mate, “It’s a petticoat.”
Jim, prescient of trouble, was silent. And the
infernal exhaust was now humming another and
more sardonic tune: “Break you, break you,
Jim.” Nothing about “ making ” him now,; only
“breaking.”
“Slow her down ! ’ Jim ordered at last. And
the craft trembled reluctantly to half-speed.
“Oh!” the woman cried, ” Oh, stop—for God’s
sake, stop ! ” And the Jessie, with much inward
and outward cursing from her officers, was eased
down about 20 yards from the island-bank.
“ What is it, ma’am!” Jim spoke with marvel-
lous distinctness, considering his throat was full of
maledictions. “Going to Echuca ? ”
“No; Swan Hill !”-she stopped, choking.
dim gave a sigh of relief before he spoke again.

“ Oil i” it was a Ion" wail this time “Ooh
Fcliuca’s too far-iny child‘is dyin’-dyin’, and I
must have a doctor. Oh, take me to Swan Hill!”
“ Impossible, ma’am. I’ll take von to Echuca
-there are better doctors there.”
“ But Swan Hill’s nearer-three hours, and-
Echuca, oh, God ! is twenty or thirty. And my
• ,i. • > i j J
child is dyin —n> clyin !
Jim and the mate looked at one another. Then
the mate uttered an enquiry as to whether she
ad asked the other boat.
“Yes,” she wailed, “ but they would not listen.
Said you were cornin’. Oh, for God’s sake, take
me ! I have a pound-it is all I have. I’ll give
y °A pound! Jim’s throat blistered. And fifteen
hundred pounds clear profit hanging on that trip !
A pound ! The joke of it ! And so he said
“No,” and in the same breath sent the telegraph-
call to the engine-room—“ Full speed ahead !”
When the woman saw the Jessie’s stem curving
towards midstream, she shrieked with a horrible
acuteness of sound. Over the exhaust was
plainly audible—“ Oh, are you men ? Fiends you
are ! May God blight your homes—your wives—
your children ! May you have your little ones
dyin’ for the sake of a doctor that someone else
could reach, but wouldn’t-oh, devils !”
Now, in Jim’s dream that day of what might be
if he pulled off the Mnngadel job was included a
home and a wife and babies clustering round him.
There was no wife as yet—not even a sweetheart,
But he had always thought that the glory of his
manhood would never be achieved till he held
wife and child in the sway of his strong arm.
And the woman’s unreasoning cry pierced him
with a superstitious fear.
He signalled the engineer to slow down.
“But,” he asked the mate, “is there a man aboard
who’d take that woman in a dingy to Swan Hill?”
“ A forty-mile pull ! You’re drunk, boss.”
“No, Bill—not drunk ! Only mad ! I’m going
to take that woman to the Hill ! Damn her !
and damn Tom Lang, of Mnngadel!”

■
Less for the sake of that poor selector’s
wife than for his own dream wife and child he
tied up his barge and turned the steamer’s head
towards the Hill township.
The woman’s only intelligence lay in her
mother-love. She was one of those half-sonled
creatures that drift through life in the Australian
bush, going through most of the acts of the great
drama of existence in a tadpolish fashion, but who
suddenly rise in the crisis of an episode to some-
tiling like the stature of a civilized woman,
When her child was seized with convulsions she
had tramped across the scrub and waded lagoons
ten miles from her husband’s selection—he was
away shearing—to the riverbank, with a dim hope
to obtain a doctor somehow. It was really Linton
who had put the idea into her head to ask Barton
to take her to Swan Hill. With the ignorant
woman’s inability to look at more than one thing
at a time she became convinced that in going to
the Hill lay hope for her child ; and, in the tragic
moment, when she made her last and successful
appeal to Jim, she had struck the one chord of his
nature to which his will would respond,

The Jessie Jane was still breathing her fatal
exhaust “ Break you, break you—Jim !” when she
reached Puggamilly again. By that time twenty-
four hours’ steaming had done its work on the
engineer and fireman. She was hauling in the
tow-rope of the barge, and the latter craft was
just beginning to cut the stream, when—
The Jessie Jane—and her skipper, and mate,
and engineer, and one deck hand—and the hopes
of the Mungalel contract—and the mortgage went
skywards (and literally on to Puggamilly Island)
at the instance of the Jessie Jane’s boiler. The
pressure-gauge had registered more and more as
the eyelids of engineer Charlie and his fireman
had become heavier, and ten minutes after the
eyelids had closed entirely the index-hand of the
gauge reached what old Freeman called “explo-
sion point.” Charlie had been roused by the
skipper hailing the barge when the Jessie reached
Puggamilly, but, sti 1 drowsy, had not noticed the
gauge, till the sudden hiss of the enfranchised
steam merged and thundered into a roar like the
trumpet of doom. And that was the ending of
everything for the Jessie Jane and her crew.
When the Echuca Steam Navigation Board
investigated the circumstance, sufficient came out
in the evidence of his own men to take some of
the gilding from the glory of Skipper Lintons
achievement. And he received a round robin
from the boat skippers one day which suggested
that he should return to the ocean-going trade,
and run down some more Greeks. They wanted
“ white ” men on the river—so the note said. Tom
M‘Grundy didn’t get his pony—then.

A Remarkable Letter.
(To the Editor of the New York Tribune.)
Sib, —As my name and face have appeared in
your paper and the public prints lately, and
as many of my professional brethren are wonder-
ing at it, I feel it only just that I should make an
explanation. The statement published over my
name was made ten years ago, after long and
mature investigation, and I have never changed
my mind as to the facts then stated. At that
time I said, as a physician, that I believed
Warner’s Safe Cure was the best of all known
preparations for the troubles it was advertised to
cure, and I say so still. I know it is considered
the proper thing for the medical profession to
decry proprietary and other advertised articles;
but why should they do so? As the late Dr. J.
G. Holland, writing over his own name in
Scribner's Monthly, said
“It is a fact that many of the best proprietary
medicines of the day are more successful than
many physicians, and most of them were first
discovered or used in actual medical practice;
when, however, any person knowing their virtue
and foreseeing their popularity secures and
advertises them, in the opinion of the bigoted all
virtue went out of them.”
Dr. Holland was an educated physician, an
unprejudiced observer, and he spoke from a broad
and unusual experience. Proprietary medicines
should not be decried. The evidences of their
value are overwhelming. I have seen patients
recover from gravel, inflammation of the bladder,
and Bright’s Disease after using Warner’s Safe
Cure, even when all other treatment has failed.
I make this frank and outspoken statement in
the interests of humanity, and because I know it
to be true. I trust for the same reason you will
give it to the public.
Respectfully, R.'A Gunn.

The Modern Shepherd.
(FOR THE BULLTIN.)
(Respectfully dedicated to the superior clergy throughout
Australia, in recognition of the eminent services they
are at present rendering the new Democracy.)
The Parson rose from his downy bed at the break
of the Sabbath Day,
lie dressed himself and decked himself in the
chaste aestiietio way—
Lavender-scented was his garb, rings graced his
lily hand ;
In truth he was a goodly sight—the parson of the
land.
The parson drove to the temple fair where the
Lord of Hosts abode,
And his carriage flew, at a rattling pace, on the
wide and dusty road
(Tis true the Master went afoot, in the days of
long ago,
Nor-pur sc nor scrip his followers bore; but the
v >tbnes have altered so).
- i*-
The* parson stood in the pulpit then and gazed
upon his flock —
The big land-sharks and the business men (the
Church re* ts on a rock !)
The big fat paunch, and the big gold guard, anti
the broadcloth shone so sleek —
’Twas a sight divine —the stately shrine of the
Lowly and the Meek.
The parson waved bis lily hand and raised his
mellow voice,
“The Lord hath been exceeding good. ILjoice !
my friends, rejoice !
The oil of gladness hath He poured in fullness on
each head,
His little lambs, in pastures green, by running
waters, led.
“ Let the men of substance raise the hymn, the
upper orders sing ;
Ye bankers! make the holy aisles of the sanctuary
ring;
Ye landlords ! join the tuneful throng and laud
Him loud who said
The landlord had not left Him where to lay His
gracious head.
“Lift up the psalm, ye usurers! the New Day
doth begin ;
Christ turned the money-changers out —but now
wo take them in ;
The creed was somewhat narrow which the
Saviour preached of old,
The simple Galilean—but we’re making wide the
fold.
“Lift up your songs, ye sons of pelf—ye burly men
of beer !
And sing, in soft, respectful tones, ye poor folks in
llv rear !
Lo ! There be many mansions in the Father’s
house on high
E'en tiie poor man, if respectful, hath a lodging
in the sky.
“Lord ! Strike the Sons of Belial low who dare to
rise and kick ;
Lord ! finite the Agitator home and touch him
to the quick;
Lord ! Guard full well the powers that be and
keep our pastures green,
Our people meek and humble, as they hitherto
have been.
“Oh, Lord ! The Discontented—they be many in
the land,
They love not us, the sanctified, Thine own
anointed band ;
Make bare Thy strong right arm and help Thy
chosen in this town —
Christ ‘ stirred the people up’ of old—but do Thou
keep them down.
“ Lord ! Send thy choicest blessing down on all
who have a stake
In this Thy pleasant vineyard. Let the scoffer
fear and quake.
Lord ! Prosper all our little specs., let corner
’lotments rise ;
So shall we win our way at last to ‘corners’ in the
skies.”
At last the shepherd ended. Then out the
bankers hied;
The land-sharks and the usurers they followed
side by side ;
The fat man with the stake came next, and then
the man of beer,
And lastly came the poor man, so respectful, in the
rear.
Then the parson left the holy place and gat him
home with speed,
And he sate him down to a royal feast (the wine
was choice, indeed);
And the servants bowed to every beck of the
shepherd’s lily hand —
In truth, he was a goodly sight, the parson of the
land !

Lydia Foote, the news of whose deatli was received by
the last English mail, stood, in her good time, some
fifteen or twenty years ago, in the very front rank of
emotional actresses, but she was seldom afforded an
opportunity of showing what she could do with a great
part. Old London playgoers will remember her Esther
Eocles, in ‘‘Caste,” especially in the final scene, where
she surprised her father in the act of attempting to steal
her child’s coral. George Honey', the original Eccles, hut
in many respects the inferior of Anson in the part, seemed
to curl up under the withering contempt of her glance,
and on the first night of the performance of the comedy
at the Prince of Wales’ the house fairly rose at the
actress. Lydia Foote, however, never had such another
chance, and though she always acted conscientiously and
at times showed an exquisite and delicate sense of pathos,
she had the misfortune to be cast principally in second-
rate melodramas, which have only an ephemeral success.
She was a niece of the veteran Mrs. Keeley.

Dear Bulletin, — Apropos a Poverty Point par.
drawing attention to the likeness of Anson to Coqnelin, it
may he worth mentioning that the English comedian,
while in Australia, was upon one occasion mistaken for
the greatest actor on the French stage. It happened
during a visit of the “divine George ” to the French flag-
ship, and as soon as the crew caught sight of him they
called out with one voice, “Ah! Cest Coqnelin!”
Nothing could persuade them, especially when Anson
addressed them in their native tongue, that their Parisian
favourite, eliminating time and space, had not made his
first appearance in Australia on hoard a man-of-war, and
they are probably of the same opinion still. To those
who have seen both actors, the resemblance is simply
marvellous, while their art-methods are strikingly
similar. There is nobody on the English stage at the
present time at all comparable to Anson in his own line,
and if he gets the show he will certainly “ knock them
when he appears there.— Egomet.
