colour me black
Black, like in the beauty above.
But now think about carbon black, and that’s a horse
of a different colour. What’s beautiful about the stuff in
tyres and rubber castors, telephones and printing inks?
Great new things are happening at Australian Carbon
Black. Things like the Thin Layer Chromatography
apparatus and techniques A.C.B. has just introduced
to allow manufacturers to successfully identify the
accelerators and antioxidants used in modern rubber
compounding. This technical development is an added
advantage to manufacturers, results in a wider range
of better, more advanced rubber products for the
consumer.
You see, advancement and development are A.C.B.
products, too, as well as high quality carbon black.
When you add our own brand of enthusiasm that has
successfully completed 1054 major research projects
for clients and the expertise gained as Australia’s sole
supplier of furnace black for the past seven years, you
get a black picture that’s a beauty.
So the next time you think of black, think of us.

’66 Riesling
The success of the Rhine
Riesling vines planted at
Coonawarra Estate is shown
by this wine. Bottled within
six months of vintage, the ’66
Riesling has retained fully
the fresh, slightly ‘spritzig’
Riesling character.

’63 Hermitage
The ripening period of 1963
at Coonawarra was
unusually humid, which
seems to have added
subtlety to the wine, giving
it greater delicacy, yet
with a deeply satisfying full
flavour. It may well prove
to be the best Australian
Hermitage ever.
Coonawarra Estate
’62 Cabernet
Following on the 1960
Vintage, (the 1961 Vintage
was a total loss at Coona-
warra Estate) the 1962 is a
bigger wine in which the
oak-maturation and
Cabernet Sauvignon
character form a well
balanced soft symphony of
flavour.
Modbury Estate
’65 Moselle
Riesling grapes vintaged
early in March result in a
light, delicate wine with all
the best characteristics of a
true Moselle. An undertone
of soft fruitiness adds an
intriguing characteristic
which will appeal to those
who prefer a crisp, not too
dry, white wine.

’62 Burgundy
A fine, big Northern
Victorian wine grown from
Shiraz, pressed and matured
in oak for three years. Now,
after bottle-ageing, this soft,
smooth Burgundy is being
released from Wynns. It is a
superb example of the big
wines produced in this area.
Modbury Estate
’65 White Burgundy
Semillion grapes, grown on
gently-contoured Northern
slopes, and expert care have
produced this full, rich
White Burgundy. The ap-
pealing fragrance and flavour
of this vintage earns it pride
of place in any cellar.

Taking the
row out
of rowing
LAST WEEK on the Barwon we cele-
brated our 100th Head of the River.
It was a bore, but first let your aged
correspondent explain. On the 17th of
June, 1868, John Field, captain of
Scotch College Rowing Club, walked
down from Eastern Hill, through swamp
and bushland, and rowed across the
Yarra to deliver a challenge to Mel-
bourne Grammar to “a friendly four-
oar gig race.”
Scotch won the first race by two
lengths and the “Herald” reported:
“The winners received a regular ovation
from their school fellows. Indeed, it
was the most hearty, genuine, and im-
pulsive cheering heard on the river for
many a day.”
Now 100 years later we have to be
careful about our hearty and impulsive
cheering. A letter from the Chief
Commissioner of Police went to every
headmaster. It said the police would
be on the lookout for these specific
offences: the throwing of objects at
moving vehicles, the throwing of flour
bombs, the climbing of fences, the de-
facement of property by paint or other
coloring.
Scotch sent out three foolscap pages
of instructions, including the letter from
the Chief Commissioner, to every boy.
The receipt of all this had to be
acknowledged by parents with a signa-
ture in the boy’s record book.
There were such items in the circular
as “No boy, except competitors, may
enter or approach the boatshed area
before, during, or after the Head of the
River race or any other race, even if we
win. Missiles, bombs, sound-making in-
struments, and provocative actions are
forbidden.
“It is a day when many critical eyes
are turned upon us and when thought-
lessness or exultation (especially if we
are successful, as we all earnestly hope)
can spoil things.”
Let’s go back a few decades. I don’t
think we ever did anything outrageous
at the boatrace. There were no flour
bombs in the old days. Always we threw
a few chaps in the river and souvenired
a number of enemy caps, and always
the day after the race the headmaster
would call a special assembly of the
whole school. Standing there, forbid-
ding, in .mortar board with hands
clasped over his behind and under his
gown, he would commence: “What a
dreadful exhibition! I was ashamed to
be associated with you yesterday.”
But the boatrace used to be wonder-
ful. It was as good as a Grand Final
and almost as good as a Melbourne
Cup. It was one of the grand social
events of the year. Rowing writers had
the verbosity of Neville Cardus and
“Table Talk” gave it lashings of space.
A chap who was in the crew usually
had stayed back until he was about 19,
just so that he could get his colors,
and he was a man of immense import-
ance. The rest of us were on a sub-
sistence diet like starving Asians, but
the crew had to be nourished on a
special fare of steak and eggs and milk.
Murray Rose, by winning all those
gold medals on a diet of seaweed and
birdseed, cruelly spoiled that theory.
But, as I say, the boatrace was a
very big deal. Both boys and girls went
in school uniform and your beloved, in
her thick dark stockings, always wore
your badge with about three feet of
ribbon. If you were really with it, and
your parents were just down from your
big property in the Riverina, you took
her to lunch at the Wattle. Otherwise
you took her to Sinport’s, the old base-
ment cafe on the block. There you gave
her a “schoolgirl’s dream,” which was
a sickly affair with a milk and ice-
cream base. If she was starving you
gave her a banana parfait, which had
banana, chocolate, ice-cream, nuts,
whipped cream, the works.
It was fairly important to wear mili-
tary boots, because there was an awful
lot of jumping to be done. Then, as
soon as the race started, there was a
roar from about 90,000 people, which
didn’t stop until the crews passed the
judge’s box. If you were actually row-
ing, you didn’t hear any individual ex-
hortations to your school, just the roar.
Then, if your crew won, it was
utterly de rigueur to rush the boatshed
and exult like hell. You shouted: “We
want crew. We want crew.” Then, as
thev came in. everybody chanted: “Well
Murray Rose
rowed bow, well rowed two, well rowed
three, well rowed four . . Then
finally you got hold of the cox and
threw him in the river.
Coxes don’t get ducked any more.
That is considered far too dangerous.
After that we would go off on triump-
hant crocodile marches through the city.
The Geelong schools would come
down on special trains, all decorated.
The school crests would be on the front
of the engines, then there would be
special theatre nights. The whole school
would go to the theatre, and the crew,
those men of almost unapproachable
distinction, sat together in the place of
honor in the dress circle.
In 1948 the Swan Street Bridge was
going up across the Yarra, so the race
took place on the Barwon. The head-
masters felt it was quieter down there.
The race needed toning down as a big
social event. So, except for one year,
it has been on the Barwon ever since.
Oh, it has had a few moments. In
1955 a man was so excited after a
win by Geelong College he tried to
swim the river and nearly drowned.
Then 1956 was a bad year with the
throwing of flour bombs, tomatoes, and
eggs. Then in 1957 there were brawls,
more flour bombs, and a Wesley old
boy was hit over the head with a base-
ball bat and taken to hospital with a
suspect fractured skull. In the wet
year of 1960 they developed the ulti-
mate refinement, the chocolate flour
bomb. This was flour mixed with
cocoa.
It was fear of all this that brought
in the dire restrictions for the cen-
tenary year. Your correspondent noted
a number of changes from the ’thirties.
In the old days the boat race was so
social one really dressed for the
occasion.
No doubt, they still do in a way.
Girls were there in shorts, boots, fish-
net stockings, and there were even a
few school old boys in bare feet. The
crowd was estimated at 28,000 and there
was only one untoward incident. Some
misguided fellow let off a smoke bomb
and the police closed in so fast you
would have thought they were defend-
ing President Johnson.
The lavatory facilities were shocking
and this is something the Geelong Coun-
cil might consider before the second
centenary. On the far bank there was
one establishment for the ladies, and,
if we coin a phrase, the course through
the queue for this Head of the River
took 34 minutes.
The cheering throughout was
middling quiet and the behaviour of the
Scotch boys was exemplary at all times.
You will be pleased to hear they did
not exult over much.
During the week there was just one
piece of pageantry. Scotch rowed over
to Melbourne, just as they did 100
years ago. In almost the identical words
of John Field they issued a challenge,
not to a friendly boatrace but to a
friendly dinner at the Windsor Hotel,
which must have been very satisfying,
for they won the Head of the River,
as they did in 1868, comfortably.

Attacking the
gnomes and
moquette
BY DAPHNE GUINNESS
UP IN DAVID JONES’ furniture de-
partment last week things were a bit
congested. Sofas, coffee-tables, pouffes,
garden benches, sun brollies, reclining
chairs all pushed back to make way for
a beige canvas pen containing 130
bright blue chairs on which sat the
bottoms of ladies seeking advice (free)
on Living With Color And How It
Psychologically Affects You.
Well, this was one attraction. The
other was interior designer the elegant
Hon. John Siddeley, brought at vast
expense from England through the com-
bined efforts of Mr. Charles Lloyd
Jones and Sir Miki Sekers, the fabric
man, to lecture here.
“They’re paying me nearly as much
as Twiggy,” said Mr. Siddeley with
relish during our interview in an off-
stage leeeeownge setting. Not Mr.
Siddeley’s setting. Good God no. His
weren’t room settings at all. They were
boxes with three white walls on which
were pinned Siddeley and Sekers in
gold plastic cutouts (“spotlight the Sid-
deley, please”), colored fabric tiles, a
piece of furniture (temporarily mislaid
in one box), and a painting, or some
sort of art form, such ,as Colin Lance-
ley’s “Phoenix Among the Stars”: $2OOO
worth of assembled metal which could
have been either a Holden engine or a
medieval instrument of torture, depend-
ing which direction the imagination
travelled. The decision to use this was
entirely Mr. Siddeley’s.
A workman nailed up a montage of
shuttles and bobbins. Ah. Another
Lanceley? Not a bit of it. That was sym-
bolic of the fabric industry. “You may
not believe this,” said Mr. Siddeley,

“but it would please me far more if a
housewife from Yagoona bought six
yards of Sekers material for cushions
than if a socialite from Double Bay
bought 60 yards for her curtains.” It
might not please Sekers, but Mr. Sid-
deley’s not that sort of employee. He is
not here to help the rich. He is here
to help those who think in terms of
moquette and gnomes. What he says is
laugh with their pretensions and they’ll
laugh, too. And, God willing, chuck
’em all out.
Mr. Siddeley kindly gave a private
run-through of his illustrated lecture.
It was delayed somewhat due to his
inability to open the paint tins with a
key-ring attached six inches from his
stomach, added to which some warning
“WET PAINT” signs fell unnoticed
face down and Mr. Siddeley got quite
a lot of white paint on his trousers and
shoes. Someone rushed in with pliers
and promised to supply buckets of water
for his brushes, but they’d have to see
if there was any turps to clean his
pants. Mr. Charles sent a message
asking Mr. Siddeley to kindly vacate
the store by five-thirty, and Mr. Sid-
deley said he didn’t know if he could.
“Who’s in there?” inquired a female
voice the other side of the canvas
pen. “The Honorable John,” replied
another female. “Who’s the Honorable
John?” shouted Mr. Siddeley, putting
his head over and silencing them with
a look. He never thought to hear that
again in Australia. The Hon. bit finished
last lecture-tour.
This is Mr. Siddeley’s third lecture-
tour in Australia. On all the others
everyone rushed up and grabbed his
sketches. This time he is hanging on to
them. It is not that he is mean. He
doesn’t see why people should have his
work for nothing. “Vogue,” for instance,
asked him to write an article and said
think of the publicity. No thank you,
said Mr. Siddeley.
However, he is very fond of Aus-
tralia and is seriously thinking of
settling down here. Seventeen years ago
his French wife, Jacqueline, said she
was sick of his being an actor, could
he please earn his living at something
different? So he gave interior decorating
a whirl. Now he is sick of that. What
Australia lacks, apart from Color in
the Home, is damn’d good public rela-
tions. And, should he put down roots,
that’s what Mr. Siddeley intends to
provide.
This week he is attacking gnomes and
moquette in Brisbane.
How he would, like Australia to look

SOMETHING
NEW
WITH GRAHAM KERR
Beating the
homely lady
from Brittany
AUGUSTE ESCOFFIER once said
that the greatest problem that faced
the creative cook was the continual
demand for innovation, a new appear-
ance, taste, or aroma.
This was three decades ago, decades
filled with international travel, decades
in which the cuisines of many countries
have been introduced to the everyday
eater. Has this satisfied the interna-
tional palate? I doubt it.
The big gap, virtually left unfilled
since Escoffier, seems to me to have
been created by two factors: first,
people going on saying “there is noth-
ing new in. food preparation that has
not been done before,” and, secondly,
the enormous “creative” barrier raised
by food processing and preservation.
So many people go on saying “There
can be nothing new” that my partially
marinated Scottish blood boils (this
culinary process I put in italics because
blood coagulates at 168 deg. F.).
Assume that we can begin to be
aware of flavor combinations at the age
of ten. God and cholesterol permitting,
we may live in this flavor belt until we
are 80. Seventy years of experience
would then be ours. If we eat three
meals a day our approximate consump-
tion equals 76,600 meals, plus an addi-
tional 51 to cover leap years. Let us
now ask the “nothing new” supporters:
how does it feel to accept that it is
impossible for you to eat or create a
single new experience in your remain-
ing meal span?
And now to the other factor. Why
should food processing and preservation
prevent, or at least slow down, the
creative cook? Surely food techrlology
makes available foods from all over the
world at a reasonable price. Also, we
find delicacies, once reserved only for a
favored few who lived in great style,
now jostling for position at the local
delicatessen. How can all this variety
be a barrier to new dishes?
The copy-book has a great deal of fun
re-creating the classics, but the edge of
excitement experienced by the creative
cook is lost. The vast majority of great
dishes were devised when preservation
was almost entirely a question of cutting

ice from a winter lake and holding it
in a summer cellar, or of leaving food
to dry in the sun/or placing it in brine,
pickle, or chimney. Because trans-
portation of perishable foods was so
restricted, each area lived on the pro-
ducts that grew naturally, and with
these natural ingredients they created
remarkable combinations. Blessed with
our modern delicatessen, their brain-
child would have been stillborn, their
local delicacy riddled with interna-
tionally accepted flavors.
And so it is in Australia today. The
desire for something new is still with
us but we struggle for international
status by sloshing up a souffle created
by a homely lady in 15th century Brit-
tany. Is all lost? Or can this barrier
be broken? Of course it can, with far
greater skill than the homely lady
from Brittany used.
Australia is a vast country. Our
climate varies from sub-tropical to
temperate. Each State has a marked
degree of food individuality. The
coastal waters teem with fish and shell-
fish, and, apart from a handful of spices
and beverages, we are entirely self-
sufficient.
There is a type of food snob who
immediately scoffs at a potential Aus-
tralian style of cookery by saying, “Aus-
tralian cuisine! I suppose that’s broiled
kangaroo or waffles and wombat.” This
is not only ill-mannered but also idiotic.
International cuisine is not based on
unusual native animals, and only sick
sophisticates crave snake’s blood cock-
tail, chocolate-coated locusts, and
elephants’ trotters.
But it took hundreds of years to de-
velop the great national cuisines, so
how can we hope ever to see our food
compete? This is a sensible question.
Frankly, I doubt if we will see it
happen in under 40 years, but this is
incredibly fast when compared with
European progress.
In my opinion, we can only enter the
creative race by an unnatural process.
We will have to assume that there are
no food processing or preservation tech-
niques, no imported foods (other than
herbs and spices), and that the area in
which we live is serviced only by
horsedrawn cart. In this way we reduce
outside influence to a minimum, setting
ourselves a task identical to that faced
by the lady of Brittany.
This exercise must create regional
cookery, but it must also develop
imagination in the kitchen, imagination
which has been partly smothered by
the enormous range of ingredients avail-
able. In essence, by ruthless elimination
of imported “red herrings” we return
to Escoffier, who said, “The greatest
problem that faces the creative cook
is the continual cry for innovation.”
(In an article by Mr. Kerr on our
April 1 issue, an editorial error gave
one “g” or gramme equalling
there are 14 grammes to the |oz.)

Huon, and Mercedes 111, will sail in
the Channel race from Cowes in July
and August. Last year Australia made
her first entry in the now ten-year-old
race, and came second to Britain. Six
nations competed then, this year the
competition will be greater. It will be
a return engagement for Caprice,
skipper Gordon Ingate and navigator
Bill Fesq; and Balandra’s navigator,
Stan Darling, sailed in one of last
year’s entries, Frey a.
Second to race internationally will be
Dame Pattie, or Gretel, still fighting it
out for the right to challenge the best
American yacht for the America’s Cup,
with Dame Pattie so far ahead on
points. And finally, in another ocean,
Perth yachtsman Roily Tasker will be
testing his skill against some more of
the world’s best.
Tasker, elated with the offshore suc-
cesses of his 50ft. ketch Siska since she
was launched this season, is aiming to
Siska rounds Rottnest, W.A.
try her out against some of the world’s
top racing cruisers next season.
He is planning tentatively to take her
to Hong Kong in February, 1968, to
compete in the China Sea race from
Hong Kong to Manila harbor, just over
650 miles, about the same distance as
the Sydney-Hobart race. The hope he
must discard to do this: another try at
an Olympic gold medal. For he has not
yet discounted the possibility of a bid
at Australian representation in 5.5
metres the class that Bill Northam
sailed to a gold medal at the Tokyo
Olympics. But the trials for Mexico City
and the China Sea race would clash,
and at this stage he is favoring the blue-
water event.
This would entail shipping Siska to
Hong Kong, probably welded in a steel
cage on the deck of a ship; the crew
would fly there, have a couple of
weeks’ training, then race against yachts
in the 60-80 ft. range, mainly from the
United States, Japan, and Philippines;
last year a fleet of 19 was beaten home
by the magnificent Dutch 70-footer
Stormvogel. Yet Tasker believes his
comparatively small Siska cOuld give her
a run for her money. “I expected great
things of this boat, and she’s even better
than I anticipated,” he says. Perhaps
her best performance this season was
in clipping two hours off the record for
Western Australia’s ocean-racing plum,
the race from Fremantle to Cape
Naturaliste and return.
Why not try her out first in the
Sydney-Hobart race? “It is closer and
less trouble, but the Sydney-Hobart
entrants are mainly rating boats, built
to get the best out of the RORC rating
system. And quite frankly, they’re not
very fast. They’re little tubby things,
and Siska would be a bit lonely ... I
think we could beat them by a fair
bit.”
The scheme of taking part in the five-
day China Sea classic—in the light to
medium conditions before the typhoon
season may not be the end of the
Roily Tasker ambition. If she con-
tinues to live up to her owner’s hopes,
Siska might then be shipped over to
compete in the Bermuda race against
the cream of the cream.
Skipper Tasker has every right to be
as cocksure as he is, considering his
record in a remarkable number of
classes. Apart from interstate successes,
he won a silver medal at the Melbourne
Olympics in 12 square metre class, won
the 1958 Flying Dutchman world series
in Austria, competed for Australia in
the next Olympics, was runner-up in
1962 in the Flying Dutchman series
held in the United States, and last
season took out a world catamaran
championship in Melbourne.
His yachting successes are matched
by his sailmaking record; he has be-
come a tycoon of this business and runs
sailmaking establishments in Perth,
Hong Kong, France, and Chicago, and
is probably Western Australia’s biggest
individual earner of Yankee-dollar
exchange.

from the past, “BBC World Round-up.”
It is their world, not ours. For example,
last week while Australians at break-
fast could read in their papers what
their Prime Minister had to say about
Cambodia after his visit there, they
could hear on radio the British view
of Cambodia, with no reference or rele-
vance to Australia, from the BBC man

AUSTRALIA
Mr. Holt states a new foreign
policy based on Asian change
AUSTRALIA’S FOREIGN POLICY
changed last week. And hardly one
Australian noticed it.
When Prime Minister Harold Hob
stood up and told the House of Repre-
sentatives what he had been doing on
his tour of Cambodia, Laos, Taiwan,
and Korea he did more than describe
a successful essay in personal diplo-
macy. He stated a new approach in
Australian attitude to the nations of
Asia, an attitude that will be more
acceptable to many of them.
His key words were: “We are not
opposed to the social revolution which
has been taking place and is continuing
in South-East Asia. This social revo-
lution reflects long-suppressed yearnings
for national identity, social betterment,
and economic progress. We also seek
these things for ourselves.”
Hitherto Australia’s stated policy has
been based almost completely on the
desire for stability in Asia. It has been
almost completely political and con-
cerned mainly with the containment of
China and the suppression of Com-
munist subversion. Holt in his speech
went on to repeat this policy when he
said: “We are opposed to the perver-
sion of the forces of social revolution
in Asia to establish through indirect
pressures, through subversion, through
insurgence, through terrorism and
oppression Communist regimes which
are neither sought nor wanted by the
majority of the people in the countries
concerned.”
This policy, however, has often been
interpreted as nothing more than an
expression of Australian self interest,
as if the one function of Asia was to
conduct itself so that it did not
threaten the Australian dream. Exter-
nal Affairs Department officials have
long been aware that it would also be
possible for Australia to apply to the
nations of Asia some of the standards
Australians apply to themselves: that
change is ever recurring and that
ordinary people should benefit from it.
Last week, in the very week in which
their own Minister was still appealing
only to fear, they found a spokesman
in the Prime Minister, finding that he
was ready to say what other Ministers
and the former Prime Minister would
never say: that the affairs of Asia were
still revolutionary and that it could be
good that this was so.
This new statement of policy added
success to another success, made evi-
dent by the Prime Minister’s choice of
the countries he visited. The choice of
Cambodia and Laos had dramatised the
fact that Australian policy has been
more subtle than some of its previous
statesmen had made it seem and Mr.
Holt underlined that when he said:
“I visited two countries which are
closely allied, like ourselves, with the
United States of America, and two
countries which seek to preserve a
status of neutrality. Our relationships
with other countries are not determined
solely on the basis of whether they are
allied with us. We accept diversity. In
our search for a stable, secure Asian
region, growing in economic prosperity,
we promote the closest relations with
Asian allies in collective defence
organisations. But we also seek to pro-
mote the best possible relations with
countries which have chosen the path
of neutrality. We support and seek to
uphold the national integrity of all
countries in the region. And beyond
this we look to a future settlement
with mainland China, without which
there can be no lasting peace in Asia.”
Opposition Leader Gough Whitlam
did the best he could when he replied
to Mr. Holt. He changed the subject
and talked about Vietnam. But he
could not disguise the fact that Mr.
Holt, in the radical tradition of good
conservative governments, had stolen
much of his policy from him.
Art and artists
Rush trip
GALLERY OWNER Rudi Roman has
just arrived back from a hectic five
weeks overseas, during which he opened
Len French’s exhibition at the Common-
wealth Institute in London, met some
expatriate Australian artists in Eng-
land and the Continent, arranged for
an exhibition of paintings by Chinese
Soo Pien to be shown in his gallery
here in July, took a few days to travel
hastily through France, Belgium, Italy,
and Switzerland, and in his capacity
of cellarmaster to the N.S.W. Wine and
Food Society had some good dinners.
The French exhibition was a great
success. It was the first time the whole
of the Art Gallery in the Common-
wealth Institute had been used for an
exhibition of one man’s work. (Usually
the gallery is divided into three with
screens.) At first they were afraid the
47 paintings would look insignificant—-
the gallery is 95 feet long and 45 feet
wide, and has one glass window wall
overlooking Holland Park. However,
the effect was magnificent—even Len
French was impressed; it was the first
time he had seen his Seven Days cycle
all hung together.
Australian painters Les Moore,
Arthur Boyd, Lawrence Daws, Colin
Lanceley, and Len Hessing were at
the opening. Brett Whiteley, who lives
in London, told Komon he was start-
ing a series of paintings based on his
stay at Whale Beach, Sydney, last year.
Away from art, Mr. Komon wined
and dined with Barry Humphries and
Michael Charlton, who is off to the
Middle East to do a documentary for
the BBC.
“It’s still the same overseas,” said
Mr. Komon resignedly. “You pay £5
for a reasonable dinner wine and could
get a better Australian one for $5, but
nobody thinks of ordering them.”
In Italy, France, and Switzerland,
Mr. Komon found dealers want as much


as they can get of Australian native
and aboriginal art.
“Modern Swiss, Italian, and French
painters are doing interesting work, but
they are all following the modern
American trend for geometric abstrac-
tion,” said Mr. Komon.
“They are losing the solid, indivi-
dualistic quality that a good artist must
have. This is why art with a strong
national style finds a good market. Soo
Pien is one artist who has this in-
dividuality. He paints in the Chinese
style with brush and pen wash,” but is
fresh and modern as well.”
Trade Minister McEwen
Kennedy Round
End of the comedy
IN CANBERRA it is freely admitted
that what Trade Minister John McEwen
said before he left for Geneva was for
the benefit of foreign Embassies as
much as for the Australian public. It
was his opening gambit in what seemed
an almost interminable poker game of
trade negotiations. This has been going
on intermittently since 1962.
In that year the new Democratic
Congress gave the U.S. President
power to cut American import tariff
rates to the extent other countries were
prepared to reciprocate. This would
lead to a major freeing of world trade
in industrial products to the benefit of
all. But from the start a stumbling
block was agriculture.
The Americans, supported strongly
by Australia and other primary pro-
ducing countries, insisted that it should
be included also. A complication has
been that primary products are pro-
tected hot so much by tariff duties as
by subsidies and import quotas, and
there is no obvious equivalence with
tariff levels. And the fierce European
farmers who will march on Paris or
Brussels and pelt their parliamentarians
with rotten fruit are also a stronger
political force against liberalisation than
industrialists.
Anyway, the poker game must all
be concluded by June 30, when the
U.S. Trade Expansion Act expires.
McEwen before he left spoke most
pessimistically about the prospects for
a satisfactory settlement. The biggest
potential customer, the Common
Market, was asking us to contractually
commit ourselves to sell wheat at well
below our cost of production. “In this
tough world one can go broke without
signing a contract to go broke,” Mc-
Ewen said soulfully.
Department officials and others
laughed at the Act because, of course,
we have been selling wheat below what
is called cost of production for more
than a decade. Under the British
agreement we sell for as little as $1.27
a bushel, the Chinese get their immense
tonnages from us at between $1.30 and
$1.40, and no one except the Australian
flourmiller pays more than $1.45.
The “cost of production” is set at
$1.55 as a political calculation designed
to help determine the Government-
guaranteed support price. It exists as
a quite academic concept.
Returns of around $1.35 and $1.40
have, in fact, provided handsome profits
for wheatfarmers in recent years, so
handsome that they have been rushing
out to plough up more and more land
each year. Acreage under wheat has
grown from 14,000,000 acres five years
ago to 21,000,000 today.
As of late last week the negotiations
had produced an offer of a floor price
from the Common Market of equivalent
to at least $1.30, and a promise not to
take their self-sufficiency policies be-
yond 90 percent of their consumption.
As a bargaining point, Mr. McEwen
is understandably denouncing this as
utterly unreasonable, and as a political
preliminary he is painting an unpromis-
ing picture.
In point of fact it looks as though
there is a fair hope of persuading the
Europeans to raise their offer to a level
acceptable to the major exporters.
“Black Jack’s” gloomy predictions are
just part of the comedy act of trade
negotiations.
Victoria
Preferences
SIR HENRY BOLTE is a hard-
bargaining, argumentative chap with a
streak of the gambler in him. In the
campaign for the Victorian elections
to be held on April 29, he is faced with
four problems: to hold his own seat,
to hold his firm majority in the Legis-
lative Assembly, to win a working
Sir Henry Bolte ... four problems
majority in the Legislative Council, and
to keep down the costs of his promises.
Central to solving the first three is
the allocation of DLP preferences
but being sure of them conflicts with
containing costs: in the arena of State
politics the DLP demands State Aid
as the price of its support.
For the past month Sir Henry has
bargained and negotiated but the DLP
has remained obdurate no pref-
erences without a substantial offer of
aid to independent schools. What the
DLP was demanding seemed to the
Premier to be too high a price and for
a while he was inclined to risk the
gamble that the DLP, even if he made
no good offers, might still have to give
him preferences or that the bulk would
go to him even without official Party
direction. He also heard a whisper that
the Catholic bishops would keep out of
the electoral battle.
But finally the DLP got its sights
close enough to see the whites of the
Premier’s eyes, and the message homed
on the Premier’s future career no
State Aid and DLP preferences go to
the Country Party. A couple of days
later the Liberal Party policy speech
promised cash grants to independent
schools ($lO a year for each primary
pupil, $2O a year for each secondary
student). It ended the major battle of
the election. DLP preferences can de-
termine the outcome in up to 30 seats,
and especially Hampden, where the
Premier sits.
The Bolte offer of State Aid was
more than matched by the offer of
the State Labor leader, Mr. Stone-
ham, who raised the ante by $500,000
in his promise of $3 million to inde-
pendent schools. Whereas the Liberal
Party simply proposed a straight per
capita grant, Mr. Stoneham more
sensibly indicated that his $3 million
would be given only after an inquiry
“into the needs of pupils and schools.”
The DLP, which has no seats in
either State House, announced that the


Liberals would get their preferences
in all but three seats.
The Labor Party promised a number
of vague though no doubt sensible
ideas: reform of the Teachers’ Tribunal,
the appointment of an Ombudsman,
more and better housing, cheaper health
services, etc.
The economic Achilles’ heel of the
Bolte administration, the Bass Strait
oil-gas deal, remained exposed but un-
tested by Mr. Stoneham. One issue on
which he might have aroused public
indignation of the kind that counts
in the ballot boxes is now only more
confused than ever: “Labor,” he said,
“will investigate in co-operation with
the Development Refinance corporation,
the acquisition under fair and reason-
able conditions of the 50 percent at
present held by Esso.”
That the Labor plan for Bass Strait
is probably meaningless is less impor-
tant than that it allows the Liberal
Party to raise the cry of “Nationalis-
ation.” There will be more foolery yet
before the present Government is re-
turned.
Immigration
Parish pumps
EVERYTHING SEEMED to be going
along nice predictable channels when
Federal Housing Minister Dame Anna-
bel Rankin flew to Perth to attend the
State Housing Ministers’ conference.
The Ministers listened to her explain
that the Commonwealth was going to
build flats for migrants, and when she
asked for reactions and several of the
Ministers opposed the idea (preferring
more Commonwealth-State Housing
Agreement money to build houses where
migrants’ jobs were) it looked as if dis-
cussion would continue.
Not so. Before Dame Annabel could
fly back to Canberra two of her seniors,
Mr. Billy Mackie Snedden (Immigra-
tion) and Mr. Leslie Bury (Labor and
National Service), announced that flats
were going to be built anyway but
only in Perth, Melbourne, Tasmania,
and Sydney. There were immediate pro-
tests from excluded South Australia and
Queensland.
From Adelaide, Premier Walsh com-
plained that his was a highly successful
migrant State, with a 22,000 intake and
hostel vacancies to prove that his Gov-
ernment’s housing and job-finding
arrangements were good. From Bris-
bane, Premier Nicklin made a different
complaint: that Queensland, with only
a 9000 intake, was not getting its fair
share of migrants although it was ex-
panding industrially as fast as anyone.
To these complaints Mr. Bury replied:
“It is our job to develop Australia, not
to pour water into particular parish
pumps.” But in London they were
pleased. “Pandering to Pommies,” said
the headlines.
Commodities
Petrol war
IS A TIGER in the tank better than a
Samurai in the cylinders? In Victoria
“Jap gas” is now selling at five service
stations, four in Melbourne suburbs and
one at Geelong, with huge signs over
the bowsers proclaiming: “5d off per
gallon.”
The new selling company is XL
Petroleum Pty. Ltd., of which the
shareholders are Mr. Bryan Fitzpatrick,
31, and his schoolteacher sister, Marita.
Mr. Fitzpatrick began business in Gee-
long 11 months ago. Since then, he
claims, his stations have been maliciously
damaged at least 17 times.
The war against XL has extended
to prices, and at one stage last week
100 service stations were advertising
5d off. Another anti-decimal station
was subsidised by Ampol to increase
the price cut to 7d for a day, a hand-
some reduction in view of the fact that
the resellers’ margin is 6fd per gallon.
Mr. Fitzpatrick denies that he is
selling “cheap” Japanese petrol. “It is
made for the American big-car market
and is stronger than the rest here.”
What the big companies want to
know is who is backing the XL com-
pany? All that Mr. Fitzpatrick will say
is that they are all businessmen in Mel-
bourne and the western district of Vic-
toria. The big companies for their part
are frightened that they will be forced
to enter a prolonged and widespread
price-cutting war. XL for its part says
that it is not able to, or interested in,
swamping the major companies.
Another spread
BUTTER IS LIKELY to be the worst
victim of the price-war in spreadable-
edible “cooking” margarines that began
quietly last week with a test run in
Newcastle. There the Allied Mills
group added Jonquil to its range
at the bargain price of 30 cents a
pound, or nine cents less than the Eta
“Super Spread” that Marrickville
Holdings introduced last month as its
latest shot in the war against the cow.
And according to the grocery news-
letter “Inside the Food Industry” that
reported the Jonquil move this week,
another margarine producer, Provincial
Traders, is also thinking about putting
out an edible “cooking” margarine.
One thing is clear. The heavy pro-
motion (and price-cutting) of these
cheaper butter-substitutes will do more
harm to the dairy industry than if the
table margarine men had been given a
reasonable increase in their (non-
competitive) production quotas early
this year.
L. V. Hawkins
Coral Sea
Oil survey
HMAS DIAMANTINA just back from
a survey off W.A. will leave Sydney
in July for the Coral Sea, carrying 60
tons of explosives, 120 officers and men,
and six scientists. Heading the experts
will be Mr. L. V. Hawkins, Head of
Geophysics of the University of N.S.W.,
who will detonate explosives in the
Coral Sea plateau, as a first step toward
petroleum exploration.
The University of N.S.W. was hoping
the Navy would provide the explosives,
but they eventually had to buy surplus
Army explosives melted down and re-
built, for $20,000. Total cost of the
program, including the running costs of
the ships, is approaching half a million
dollars.
The expedition is financed jointly by
Australia and the U.S.A., and an
American ship, Verna, from Lamont
Observatory, U.S.A., will be going with
Diamantina. The program is part of
the Exchange Agreement between the
U.S. and Australian Navies, in which
oceanographers and marine scientists
from both countries conduct joint
expeditions for marine geophysical
research. (A similar ship, Geo 1, is re-
fitting in Brisbane after a survey off
New Zealand.)
The American half of the expedition
is being financed by the U.S. Office of
Naval Research and the National
Science Foundation of America. The
Australian half is financed by the uni-
versities, with some backing from
petroleum companies— $lO,OOO from
Gulf Oil, $6450 from British Petroleum,
$5OOO from Shell and Esso—and the
Australian Research Grants Committee
has given $31,000. Much of the money
raised has already been spent on equip-
ment. Sonar buoys, for instance, are
being built in England and will prob-
ably have to be flown out to get here
on time.


Image-building
New professionals
THE FACE OF Peter Westerway,
television’s “Seven Days” director and
commentator, is well-known through-
out Australia but may not be seen
often in future. He has turned in his
$9OOO job to contest the N.S.W. seat
of Gosford for the ALP, in an elec-
tion which may not take place until
next year. Meanwhile, he will mount
a “new professionals” campaign and
also put 45 Labor candidates through
an image-building course to make
their TV appearances more successful,
helped by his twin brother, Jim, who
is a director of one of Australia’s
biggest advertising agencies.
To former political science lecturer
Westerway, political images are not
fairy tales but effective ways of get-
ting an important message across.
“I’m not in politics for the money,”
he says, which is obviously true since
his salary as an MLA would come
down a couple of thousand dollars.
The Labor Party Westerway wants
to project would have a sort of John
Kennedy appeal to the “un-tapped
idealism of Australian youth.” He be-
lieves that younger people are coming
closer to commitment than their
parents.
Ironically the Gosford constituency
is low on youth. More than a third
of the population is over 60. “Elderly
people,” Westerway hopes, “are nos-
talgic for the golden years of Chifley
and will welcome a young, forceful
Labor Party image.” Perhaps more to
the point: changes in consituency
boundaries are now giving more Labor
votes to Gosford at the expense of
neighboring Wyong, now held for
Labor by Sydney’s ex-Lord Mayor
Harry Jensen. But no one has explained
what the above picture of Peter Wester-
way in New Guinea, released by him,
will mean to the retired people and
citrus farmers of Gosford.

FOR SOME REASON April 29 seems
to appeal to political forces as an ideal
date for elections. On that day Vic-
toria goes to the polls; so does Brisbane
to elect the rulers of its city-state, the
Brisbane City Council; and so do
400,000 people in north-eastern N.S.W.
who will decide, perhaps once and for
all time, whether they want a new State
to be called New England.
This quiet, remote New State Refer-
endum is attracting little attention else-
where in Australia, although the futures
of several other New State movements,
particularly in the Riverina and
Queensland, will largely depend on the
result.
At first the cards seemed stacked
against a “Yes” vote only because
heavily populated, industrially minded
Newcastle was included, without much
chance of being the capital and seat
of power. The rest of proposed “New
England” was very much rural, oriented
against Sydney as a “strangler of decen-
tralisation.” (A view which Sydney
noted by virtually ignoring a visit and
Press conference by the president of
the New State Referendum Council,
Mr. Garry Nehl, last week.)
However, the “quiet Referendum”
has turned up some surprises. As the
campaigns near their end, Newcastle
seems to be divided fairly evenly be-
tween potential “Yes” and “No” voters,
but the rural Hunter Valley around it
seems solidly “No.” The dairy farmers
fear the loss of their Sydney milk
market. The northern N.S.W. banana
growers also favor “No,” so do the
poultry and egg men. Overall, sectional
interests predominate. New England
cannot see a closer alternative market
(in Brisbane) as, say, the Riverina
could (in Adelaide and Melbourne).
Some cynics say that’s why New Eng-
land has been given its chance of State-
hood first.
Sport
Financial suicide
LOOKING AROUND a half-filled
Sydney Stadium on the night last week
when the Russian amateur boxers, some
of the world’s best, were fighting (they
had drawn only 3000 people the week
before) it was natural to wonder why
the amateur sports insist on committing
suicide financially. The Boxing Union
was losing $3OOO on the deal, at a
venue which is Sydney’s “home” for
the pop stars. Any one of Australia’s
teenage attractions would probably
have been glad to sing a few songs and
boost the “house” well above the cost
of his fee.
The problem of promotion for ailing
sports is world-wide. The American
Lawn Tennis Association has just
appointed Robert Malaga, a successful
tennis promoter, at $125,000 a year to
boost the game in the U.S.A. Here in
Australia a W.A. football club, Swan
Districts, is about to break new ground
by booking the British pop group The
Shadows for two days in May at Her
Majesty’s Theatre, Perth. Fund-raising
is the club’s sole aim, but combina-
tions of unpopular sports events and
popular entertainers seems not only a
way to make money but also an ideal
way to introduce more of the youth of
the country to various sports.

Man on the Land
“Residual liabilities” and
dairy farming
THE POSITIVE RESULT of the dairy
legislation, to be renewed for another
jive years, will continuation of the
direct and indirect subsidies. The
problem of the marginal farmer, a sub-
ject which has aroused a good deal of
discussion, will continue, we would say,
to be a problem for longer than five
years. This is the disappointing part
of the Gov'ernment’s approach, and one
wonders if i + he marginal-producer plans
are so much window-dressing.
One gets the feeling that, instead of
a rationalisation and streamlining of
dairying, we wilM see marginal pro-
ducers becoming marginal in a bigger
way. The theme of the speech in the
House of Representatives by the Min-
ister for Primary Industry, Mr. Ader-
mann, was that things should go on as
before because the Government recog-
nises the importance of dairying to the
national interest, etc., etc. In this sense
the national interest would seeiJi to be
the interest of dairyfarmers and the
Country Party.
Nowhere in Mr. Adermann’s speech
was there any recognition that loweJ
bome-market prices for dairy products
could be in the interest of millions of
Australian consumers and could be the
spur to the reorganisation that the in-
dustry needs. In fact, he made the
rather remarkable claim that the fact
of farmers receiving such high returns
(through the bounty) means that “the
prices of butter and cheese paid by Aus-
tralian consumers can be held down to
levels that otherwise would not be pos-
sible.”
This is the same line of reasoning
which has it that a Government-support
price system permits farmers to “put
a price” on their produce “like every-
one else.” It does nothing of the kind.
It puts on a price which the taxpayer,
whether he likes it or not, has to make
up. The world price stays, as ever, the
price the buyer will pay. Nevertheless,
the provisions of the Dairying Industry
Bill 1967 and the Processed Milk Pro-
ducts Bounty Bill 1967 are much what
was expected (what the Dairy Industry
Council asked for) and preserve also the
quaint phrasing which leads the un-
suspecting to believe that all the pro-
visions come within the $27 million
annual bounty. They do not.
The bounty proper is to be continued
a t the rate of $27 million a year on
Butter and cheese and related butterfat
Products. Then there is the bounty pay-
able on the export of processed-milk
products, which is to be continued at
the rate of $BOO,OOO a year. Then there
is the underwriting of equalisation
values for butter and cheese.
Here, in his speech, Mr. Adermann
introduced a useful euphemism
“residual financial liability.” He said,
and it is encouraging to note that he
did say it, that “the underwriting ar-
rangement was never intended to be a
price-support measure and the Govern-
ment does not intend to underwrite a
figure in any year which is going to
involve it in a residual liability. If
returns in any year are estimated to
fall, then the level at which returns
will be underwritten will also fall. The
C. F. Adermann
industry is aware of this and appreci-
ates that the value of the arrangement
lies in the ability of the Equalisation
Committee to make higher initial in-
terim payments than would otherwise
be possible.”
We are not sure if, in the past, all
members of the industry did quite ap-
preciate this, though they may now.
The operative word is “estimated.” With
dairy products in overproduction in
Europe, and with United States farmers
seemingly certain to win Congress ap-
proval for a permanent ceiling on dairy
imports, the task of estimating the price
the world will pay for Australian but-
ter and cheese is not going to be easy.
The estimators, who in the tradition
of planning, prefer calling a loss a
“residual liability,” have made mistakes
before. One, with sugar, was more tihan
a little slip. If it had happened in pri-
vate enterprise, heads would have rolled.
The great difficulty is probably not so
much in finding markets (you can al-
ways sell something if it is cheap
enough) but in finding reliable markets.
The history of Australian primary
industry exporting shows that the only
reliable market was the British one.
Loyalty to the Empire and all that did
have some sound economic reasoning
behind it and was always two-sided, of
course. They paid us a fair if not
extravagant price, and their money
earned dividends in investments in this
country. But they did not, usually, tear
up the agreements as it suited them. It
seems fashionable these days to talk of
these things in the past tense and prob-
ably this is what it has come to. The
British market will continue to exist, of
course, but no one seems to expect it to
offer gains commensurate with Austra-
lian productivity increases. Not in dairy-
products, anyway.
The U.S. market for primary pro-
duce is, in contrast, an on-again off-
again one and will stay that way until
we become the 51st State. U.S. dairy-
farmers have been virtually given a
guarantee by Agriculture Secretary
Orville Freeman that a permanent ceil-
ing will be brought down on all dairy
imports. Caught in a vicious co.sts-prices
spiral, U.S. dairyfarmers have resorted
to desperate tactics to bring pressure on
their Government. In the imme'diate
future any sales of Australian dairy
produce to the U.S. are likely to be
token sales only.
Asia? The dairy industry is active
in Asia. The industry itself, with its
own funds, liberally aided by the Com-
monwealth Government and Australian
private enterprise, is really making an
effort to sell dairy produce in Asia.
One result of this effort is the string
of milk-processing plants in Malaysia,
the Philippines, Thailand, and else-
where. They are, apparently, going
along quite well after initial difficulties.
All this would be very good indeed
except that for every gain achieved
there seems to be a corresponding
slackening in exports that would other-
wise have come from Australian home
dairy factories. Reliability is not the-
strong note in any Asian market, and
the most reliable, Japan, is not an Aus-
tralian preserve.
In demanding a ceiling on imports,
the U.S. dairyfarmers nevertheless look
to Japan as an export market of great
promise. They may be disappointed
with the results also, but that will not
stop their trying to exploit it.
Mr. Adermann surprised us a little-
coming in on margarine, because the
quotas are a States matter. However,
he devoted a considerable part of his
speech to margarine and the reasons
why it should be held back by quotas.
One seems pretty safe in predicting that
this form of subsidy will continue for
some time also. The first crack in
the fort will probably come, within a
few years, from Mr. Adermann’s own
State, Queensland, where farmers who
now milk cows may see advantages in
growing oil seeds. They might see the
advantages more quickly if the rational-
isation of the dairy industry, and the

Eggs—often stale
to repulsive
POULTRY FARMERS can take a bow.
On the whole the eggs they send to
market from year’s end to year’s end
are of good quality and flavor. It’s
after they leave the farm gate that the
rot sets in. By the time many eggs reach
the city family’s breakfast table they
are barely fit to eat. The main trouble,
according to a CSIRO investigatory
team from its Division of Food Preser-
vation, is that the eggs spend too long
moving through the marketing chan-
nels.
One egg in every average dozen pur-
chased in shops around Sydney falls
into the category “moderately stale to
repulsive.” Most of the rest of an aver-
age dozen would likely be classified
as stale, off-flavor, or flat flavored. Only
during the cooler months, April to
October, do the eggs in the shops gener-
ally reach or exceed very modest
quality standards.
Although the survey, which was con-
tinued for three years by the CSIRO
team, was mainly confined to the Syd-
ney area, its findings might well be ex-
trapolated to all capital cities. The
situation in country towns that are not
self-supporting in eggs would probably
be even worse.
Wherever and whenever prevailing
ambient temperatures exceed 65 deg. F.
your chance of buying good quality
eggs is very low, largely because of the
marketing system. The average egg
spends at least 14 days in its journey
from the nest to the retail sale counter.
It is an established fact that eggs held
for seven days at 68 degrees F. just
exceed the U.S. Department of Agri-
culture’s minimum acceptable standard.
The CSIRO Division of Food Preser-
vation now, accordingly, recommends
that the average marketing time should
be reduced to less than eight days un-
less cool storage or a method of preser-
vation is universally introduced by the
egg-marketing authorities. At 55 degrees
F. the rate at which an egg loses its
quality is about half that at 72 degrees
The housewife should note that the
quality measurements made by the
Division of Food Preservation were
conducted within a few hours of get-
ting the samples from the shops. If she
hasn’t got a fridge she should shop
every day for her eggs in summer. For
those with fridges twice-weekly shop-
ping seems to be desirable under the
present circumstances. Housewives
should also note that the measurements
were made only on eggs which had
already been candled and given an “A”
grade by the Egg Marketing Board.
Candling enables the packer to see into
an egg and discard those with weak
shells or which contain large blood or
meat spots and those which are visibly
rotten due to microbial invasion. The
number of such rejects is relatively
small. Perhaps people who appreciate
Candling eggs before packing
the quality of farm-fresh eggs should
try to avoid buying eggs that have
passed through the Board.
The survey team used four different
measurements of quality. The con-
currence between each was most strik-
ing. However, since the proof of a
pudding is in the eating, the taste
test is probably the more interesting
of the four quantitative and qualitative
assessments employed. The scientists, of
course, seem to be more fascinated by
the agreement between the physical
measurements they applied.
The introduction of a preserving
treatment on the farms would result in
a vast improvement. Presumably, the
consumer would be required to pay a
trifle more to reimburse the farmer.
Oiling, if done within ten hours of lay-
ing, is an astonishingly effective preser-
vative. It can at least double an egg’s
shelf life. The process consists of dip-
ping the newly gathered eggs in a taste-
less, odorless, and colorless mineral oil
such as paraffin, letting them drain
overnight and then boxing them for
market. As mentioned earlier, cool (be-
low 55 degrees F.) storage and trans-
port during marketing would help
greatly, because from November to
March air temperatures throughout
populated Australia are in the range
62-77 degrees F.

Building Sheet.
One ingot of aluminium is much the
same as another. It's what you make
of it that counts. And that's where the
power of ideas comes in.
Take Alcan Building Sheet. We made
it thicker and wider than competitive
sheets so that the job can go up
faster with fewer laps and fastenings.
Tradesmen and handymen reckon
that was a pretty good idea.
Alcan Building Sheet goes through a
cladding process, which is a sort of
alloy lamination that gives the surface
maximum corrosion resistance.
That's not a bad idea either.
Incorporated into the design of the
sheet is a sure weatherproof device
for the side laps which has been
tested against the most adverse
weather conditions. The sheet's dis-
tinctive embossed pattern is featured
on all accessories—right down to the
washers. Maybe that's not a big deal,
but it does make.the finished job look
neater and more professional. You can
see Alcan Building Sheet on display
at your builders supplier and hard-
ware store. He'll be only too happy
to give you a copy of the brochure
which explains all about the product.

COMMENT
Tribute to
the fighters
KAREN GREEN is only 22 months old,
too young to know where or what Viet-
nam is, or to understand what it means
that her father is going off to risk his
life in a war. But in an innocent gesture
of love she symbolises one of the prin-
cipal tragedies of human history, that
the human species has not yet learned
how to practise the brotherhood of
which it sometimes dreams.
Times would be happier in several
thousand Australian households if Aus-
tralia simply sunned itself in the magic
circle of its prosperity, careless of what
happened in the countries to its north.
But Australia’s interests say otherwise,
with the unjust yet inexorable demand,
from which neither Australia nor any
other nation can yet escape, that some-
times young men should be slaughtered
so that others can live in peace.
And surely the sense of brotherhood,
still strong in Australia, now also impels
us into the affairs of the nations
of Asia, in acts other than those of
war. Of this truth our comprehension
is as yet slight: it is perhaps in its grow-
ing that our nationhood, our self-
confident expression of independent
identity, will finally be achieved. Not
only by going to war but in a thousand
acts of peaceful comradeship.
It is not for nothing that Austra-
lians have chosen Anzac Day as their
one true national day. There are few
countries that acknowledge their iden-
tity by celebrating defeat and com-
memorating the dead. Yet through
the brief and sometimes forced high
spirits of men trying to recapture
(sometimes impossibly) their youthful
companionships, in Anzac Day we also
remind ourselves that life can be a
hard course to run, that its consola-
tions can be snatched from us as easily
as they are given, that its indignities
are best faced with a certain laconic
unconcern, and that disaster is part of
the very nature of things.
This Anzac Day we should think of
Vietnam. Of the Diggers there and
their families at home, re-enacting the
pains of history’s oldest sacrifice while
the rest of us get on with our normal
business, as if the expenditure of the
happiness and lives of others was no
longer our concern. And of the men
who are fighting with them and even
most of the men they are fighting
against caught up in the tide of his-
tory and swirled in its currents.
We should recognise these tragedies
and their meaning. There is something
immensely dishonorable in agreeing
to the sending of men to fight and
then not paying their sacrifice respect
by acknowledging what fighting is.


Canada: DOWN UNDER
Canada's flag is the red maple
leaf. We cling to the Red Ensign
Australia's north and west are hot, dry, and barren ; Canada's north
and west are cold, ice-bound, and equally barren
MOUNTIES, SNOW FORESTS, miles
of ripening wheat, the cry of “mush”
around the Yukon, and even a brand
of patent cough medicine: the name
Canada still evokes in an Australian
some of the old images and cliches; but
the frontier and rural images are now
mixed in with those of the widely
advertised Canadian “boom.”
Canada means skyscrapers as well as
scrub pines, the fiery ovens smelting ore
in the Alberta foothills as well as the
fur traps of Hudson Bay, and the inter-
national fair, Expo 67, which has swept
up into its giant industrial and com-
mercial complex even the famous, Cal-
gary Stampede. Culture is at a pre-
mium, too; there are now more art
shows than harvest festivals.
The making of comparisons between
Australia and Centennial Canada is in-
viting. One hundred years after
Confederation the North American
Provinces, stretching from Atlantic to
Pacific across almost 4000 miles and
reaching more than half that distance
north from the Great Lakes, have
similar political institutions to our own,
bonds with Britain loosening one by one,
\ an anxious immigration policy in terms
of both numbers and color, an economy
in which industrial expansion has
smothered its agricultural base, in-
cessant worries about export staples
and balance-of-trade, and a fear of
United States capital and cultural im-
ports.
There are also strong geological,
climatic, and demographic comparisons
to be made. Our north and west are
hot, dry, and barren; their north and
west are cold, ice-bound, and equally
barren. Only one-third of Canada’s total
area (after the U.S.S.R. it is the largest
country in the world) has so far under-
gone any serious economic develop-
ment, and less than eight percent of
the country is classified as occupied
farmland.
Where their northern developers
challenge the brutalities of the long,
frozen winters, ours face the monot-
onous, enervating temperatures of
Capricorn and beyond. But for most
citizens of both nations such things
are matters of myth and slogan. In
Australia the bulk of the population
lives in the temperate fertile crescent
extending from Brisbane to Adelaide;
Canadians mostly live within easy driv-
distance of the United States border;
as Premier of British Columbia put
* t: Canada is as as the U.S. but
an * nc h deep.
The sociological links are evident.
The similarities of our two ex-colonial
conditions being strong, it is surprising
that our ties are not stronger, our in-
terest in one another not greater. Even
the Commonwealth has not been much
of an international matrimonial broker,
although it must be granted that eight
years ago Sir Robert Menzies was be-
ing freely tipped as the next Canadian
Governor-General.
Perhaps the differences in tempera-
ment have loomed too large. Australian
society lacks the internal tension created
in Canada by the divisions between
British and French. Those of British
stock and language make up about two-
thirds of the people; the French com-
ponent is less than half this figure,
Banknotes, stamps, and Government
documents are printed in both
languages. The business of the House of
Commons, the Senate, and the Federal
Courts are conducted bilingually. Pack-
aged household goods bear instructions
in French and English,
The French live mostly in Quebec
and they have not forgotten the Eng-
lish conquest of that territory a couple
of centuries ago. From time to time the
French have practised the advice of a
former Bishop of Quebec, who said
after the victory of Wolfe in 1759, “The
best way to remain French is to stay
British.” They fought alongside the
Anglo-Saxons in 1812 and in 1867
voluntarily joined the Confederation.
The secessionist movement, however,
remains strong underground, and in
recent years has developed a terrorist
fringe. Last year a bomb was exploded
in the washroom of Canada’s House of
Commons. Two years before, the Que-
bee Liberation Army issued a threat to
Queen Elizabeth on the eve of her
royal tour that she should cancel the
visit “unless she is aspiring to be the
first British Sovereign to die on the
soil of Quebec.”
The racial, language, and religious
barriers between French and English
are aggravated by differences in
standards of living. It is estimated that
Quebec is only about two-thirds as
wealthy per capita as most other areas
of Canada, and Quebec has so far not
shared much in the mineral boom,
Australian friction between English
and Irish, Pommy and Paddy, has been


Lumber is to Canada much as wool is to Australia . Bigger newspapers
and more housing almost anywhere are good news for Canadians
mild by comparison. Here religious dif-
ferences are being swallowed up in
ecumenism, economic disparities are not
very important any more, and there are
no significant geographical ghettoes. In
Canada attempts have been made to
ease the tension, the red maple leaf
has replaced the Red Ensign as the
national flag, Privy Council Appeal
has been abolished, the two languages
are promoted in the civil service and the
armed forces; but the tension remains.
Beyond all these differences lies a
deeper and for some Canadians, a
profoundly unbalancing problem, which
causes no Australians to miss their beer
after work: the problem, or even the
mystery, of national identity.
Australians, from wharfies to poets —
even poet-wharfies—seem to learn from
the moment of conception that they are
about to be born into a national tradi-
tion, that there is something distinctive
(special?) in being, an Australian. The
symbolic signs may not be an over-
whelming testament to foreigners: a Fair
Go, Anzac, She’s Near Enough, the
Melbourne Cup, Ladies’ Night at the
Leagues Club; but somewhere buried
behind is a national tradition, legend,
or at least the belief in it.
Canada’s trouble is best described
by her alien son, the novelist Mordecai
Richler. He suggests that though there
may be life on Mars and an abominable
snowman there is still no such thing as
a Canadian nation: “There are the
French, sheltered by a language and
traditions all their own, and there are
the English-speaking Canadians who are
essentially Americans and whose cul-
tural capital, like it or not, is New
York. . . .
This kind of opinion has been bitterly
attacked by Canadian nationalists (that
there are nationalists does not prove the
existence of a nation as a cultural
entity but simply that some people
want one) and Richler is strong in his
own defence: “That we are Americans
seems to me not even an opinion let
alone an outrageous one, but a fact
that must be self-evident to anybody
save the most touchy of nationalists,
Neither does this imply that there are
no peculiarly Canadian traits. What it
does mean is that these characteristics,
like those of Texas or Southern
States, are real but legional.
In short, what the anti-nationalists
claim is that Canada is a country with-
out a navel. Their case is a powerful
one and gathers strength when com-
pared with the wishful fatuities of
former Governor - General Vincent
Massey: “In London during the war
years (World War II) were to be
seen servicemen in great numbers and
diversity than had ever assembled there
before . . . Among them were thousands
of uniformed men who would have
puzzled an observer a generation or two
ago. They resembled in many ways both
Englishmen and Americans, but they
could not have been mistaken for
either.

very small margin of error one could
spot them in the streets as such long
before their badges could be identified,

Leaving the Canadians to worry out
their problems of national identity,
Australia can accept the fact of the
Canadian nation-State and conduct a
valuable compare-contrast exercise.
Economically, Canada is much like
Australia, though a bit bigger and a bit
richer.

Canada has more than half as many
people again as Australia, but its
economy is well over twice the size of
ours. It is the sixth country in the
world in the size of its foreign trade
and the volume of its industrial pro-
duction. It is beaten only by the Big
Economic Five the U.S., U.S.S.R.,
Germany, France, and Britain and is
ahead of Japan; Australia, about
twelfth, sits behind smaller countries
like Holland, Sweden, Belgium.
Canada’s postwar development has
been in some ways similar to Aus-
tralia’s. After a great surge of growth
through until the end of the Korean
War, the Canadian economy settled into
eight years of virtual stagnation. Immi-
gration lagged, investment settled at a
low level, and unemployment grew to
the highest rate in the industrialised
world.
In the words of Canada’s “Economic
Council,” during the decade 1954 to
1963 the country “experienced one of
the slowest rates of growth of any in-
dustrially advanced country.” It was
held back mainly by conservative gov-
ernments which did not rate economic
growth an important priority.
But early this decade with the winds
of Kennedy-change blowing through
North America, the Canadians finally
took up the economic slack and got
their country moving again. The cur-
rency was stabilised at a lower level,
enabling Canadian industry to gain a
competitive edge and manufactured ex-
ports rose threefold from $350m.
to over $ 1000m. in a five-year
period. Internally, Keynesian pump-
priming also helped, and by the begin-
ning of 1966 unemployment was down
to Australian levels.
With the steady and, by 1950s stand-
~. , .
ards spectacular econom.c growth in
the U.S., house construction and news-
paper circulation began to rise. And
since forest products, especially timber
and paper pulp, are to Canada what
wool is to Australia, American pros-
perity began to rub off. A bold abolition
of tariff barriers on motor vehicles
traded with the U.S. opened the way to
a major expansion of that industry
based on greater specialisation and more
modern methods.
As in Australia, there is great concern
over American ownership of local in-
dustry. It has, of course, gone further
in Canada than in Australia. Sixty per-
cent of the equity in Canadian industry
is held by Americans against 20 per-
cent here. Rubber and motor vehicle
firms are entirely American; chemicals
and electrical appliances, oil and gas
70 percent.
Canada has its Mr. McEwen in Wal-
ter Gordon, a former Finance Minister,
whose nationalist slogan of “Buy Back
Canada” and whose “Canadianisation”
policies appeal to anti-American feel-
ings. Few economists, however, are con-
cerned about American ownership. They
point out that most of the capital inflow
has been used to develop industries
which increase exports or supplant im-
ports and has therefore more than off-
set any flow of profit remittances which
it will entail. Canada’s resources are
so immense that they cannot possibly
be developed quickly without foreign
capital.
Nevertheless, the Canada Develop-
ment Corporation, ten percent govern-
ment-owned, will tap Canadian savings
and use them to provide equity finance
for industries which might otherwise
seek American capital. With a $2OO
million initial capital, and expectations
of further calls of the same order, it
is potentially an extraordinarily power-
ful institution. Unlike Mr. McMahon’s
Bankers’ Development Refinance Cor-
poration, it will acquire shares, and,
rather than leaving investment decisions
to the trading banks, it will operate
quite independently.
By Australian standards, Canadian
economic policy is outward-looking. Its
exports are more than twice ours, ac-
counting for almost 25 percent of total
production against Australia’s 16 per-
cent. It looks to the expansion of for-
eign markets rather than to their main-
tenance; it sees tariff reduction as de-
sirable. Who could imagine Mr. Mc-
Ewen saying what Canada’s Finance
Minister said recently: “We in Canada
will have to make numerous reductions
in our Customs tariff. These should
help make our economy more efficient.”
Despite its outward orientation
Canada is far from being integrated
with the American economy. Its stand-
ard of living is estimated to be at least
20 percent below the U.S. mean.
Many attempts have been made to
account for the disparity. Though good
by Australian standards, Canadian edu-
cational expenditure has lagged behind
that of the U.S. In 1961 Canadians in
the 25-34 age group had ten years’
schooling on average against 12.4 years’
for Americans. This is said to account


for perhaps a third of the discrepancy.
Small though they are, tariff barriers
are said to be the most important item
accounting for the lower standard of
living. They force up Canadian costs by
fostering a range of inefficient indus-
tries.
The Federal Government of Canada
is not limited in its powers in the same
way as Australia’s. Twenty-nine areas,
such as defence, trade, banking, cur-
rency, railways, and foreign relations,
are specifically defined as being within
the authority of the Federal Govern-
ment. Sixteen are assigned to the Pro-
vincial Governments. The Constitution
gives the Federal Government exclu-
sive powers over all other matters.
Apart from economic policy the areas
of Canadian Federal administration of
most concern to Australia are defence,
foreign policy, and immigration.

and has no troops in Vietnam. Late
last year the Canadian Secretary of
State for External Affairs proposed to
the United Nations General Assembly
that both the Governments of Taiwan
and Red China be represented in the
United Nations as members represent-
ing the territory over which they have
effective jurisdiction.
The speech was not received with
much acclamation by the Governments
fighting in Vietnam, but the Canadian
Government hotly denies that it is tend-
ing toward non-alignment.
Canada offers its membership of
NATO and the fact that it has more
troops overseas than Australia cur-
rently 15,500, of whom 13,000 are with
NATO, 1100 in Cyprus, 900 in the
Gaza Strip, and some in Kashmir —as
signs of the general direction and
seriousness of its foreign interests.
The Canadian High Commissioner
told THE BULLETIN last week: “I
know that there is a feeling in Australia
that we have a rather boy-scoutish
approach to our foreign policy, that
we have overmuch faith in the United
Nations, and that we are not as tough-
minded and realpolitik as Australia. But
we felt from the beginning that the
United Nations has serious limitations,
and Australians must remember that
we are basically oriented to the North
Atlantic. However, we did accept a
position on the International Commis-
sion in Vietnam after our friends asked
us to. The policeman’s lot is not a
happy one.”
In fact, Canada’s foreign and defence
policies seem to be rather like Aus-
tralia’s pre-Vietnam, except that judged
by pre-Vietnam standards they are prob-
ably a bit more realistic and responsible
than Australia’s were. A vital difference
in our situations is that Canada cannot
conceive of a situation arising in which
the United States would not immed-
iately rally to its defence. The un-
pleasant reality is that Australia can.
The Canadian Government has very

much the same attitudes to immigration
as our own: it wants a lot of migrants
and it strongly prefers Europeans.
There is no “White Canada” policy and
never has been, but in practice the
Canadian Government uses a number
of selection criteria to keep the number
of Asian and West Indian migrants at
a low level.
As well as contributing their skills
and labor to the economy the post-
war migrants have made notable contri-
butions to social and cultural life. A
number of migrant artists are reaping
the harvest of money and fame which is
part of the Canadian art “boom.” Their
literary achievements in exploring the
dimensions of urban life more than
match similar attempts in Australia.
After generations of searching for the
Canadian Identity, Canadian writers
may have found one in the search it-
self. On the way they are gathering
awards from the Canada Council
and various foundations (up to
Can.sls,ooo) that make Commonwealth
Literary Fund grants look like lunch
money.
Canada never had a period like the
1890 s in Australia, when the moral
certainties of a colony were crystallised
into a coherent national “legend.” In-
stead she had the United States down-
stairs. In their determination not to
become America’s attic, Canadian
novelists helped build the image of a
beleaguered garrison; but modern
Canadian novelists like Mordecai
Richler, Brian Moore, Margaret Laur-
ence, and Leonard Cohen have moved
from the garrison into the metropolis,

French, however, has succeeded in
breaking out of a cultural cocoon when
many Australian novelists are still pre-
occupied with a proletarian naturalism.
New writing unleashed after Quebec’s
quiet revolution has frequently fore-
shadowed fiction in English by explor-
ing individuals in depth rather than
society in the broad. Marie-Claire
Blais’ macabre prose has replaced much
of the habitant' humor and social con-
sciousness of earlier writers.
The two solitudes still remain. Of
the 44 Canadian novels published in
1965, for instance, exactly half were
written in French; none was translated.
And English Canadians paid as much
attention to the 33 volumes of poetry
in French (of a total of 66 published)
as they paid to Australian verse.
The problem in both cases is langu-
age. Fifteen years ago Irving Layton
almost single-handedly revolutionised
Canadian poetry in English with his
“American” experiments in speech
rhythm. Some Canadians would con-
sider a lot of Australian verse dull and
flaccid in comparison. They also sus-
pect its uniformity, lacking both the

variety of Canadians such as Earle
Birney and A. M. Klein.
Younger Canadian poets are now try-
ing to capture the mosaic mesh of aural
civilisation in their own Canadian tradi-
tions. The mercifully dead Beats, the
Black Mountain movement (a molehill
in Australia), historical found poems,
pop poems, psychedelic happenings: all
are being transformed by that passionate
restraint which is the central quality
of Canadian poetry. That Earle Birney,
now 62, has been receptive to these
experiments may be one reason why he
is still an exciting and substantial poet.
Canadian poets share with modern
Australian poets in their strains of
idealistic romanticism and ironic
realism, though the Canadians more
readily engage with the reality of urban
life. Much of their new work is poetry
of the megalopolis; cool, witty, fright-
ened, and driving.
The visual and performing arts in
Canada suffer from almost an em-
barrassment of riches. Ten years ago
the Federal Government established an
endowment fund of $50,000,000, and
the Canada Council bestows much of
the income from this sum to ballet,
opera, theatre, art galleries, and in-
dividual artists.
The Stratford Festival has become
internationally famous since it began
14 years ago, in a circus tent, and
regional theatrical groups have a much
stronger following than equivalent
bodies do in Australia.
The Canadian film industry is large
and skilled judged by Australian stan-
dards. There are about 70 private and
eight Government film-making agencies
in Canada producing films, trailers,
newsclips, and newsreel stories. Half
are produced in English and two-fifths
in French. The National Film Board
of the Federal Government has made
a number of outstanding documentaries
in recent years, “The Drylanders,” a
chronicle of the life of a Western
pioneer family, being the best known.
One hundred years after Federation,
Canada will display itself to the world
through Expo 67, the abbreviated title
of the Universal and International Ex-
hibition of 1967. The exhibition will be
open every day for six months, begin-
ning April 28. The list of attractions,
exhibits, and events is so large and
various that it should stun even the
most devoted tourists.
A successful Expo will not establish
a Canadian national identity, but it
will advertise the competence of Can-
adian industry and planning. Australia,
which has staged an Olympic Games,
will be represented at the exhibition.
Australia and Canada are alike in
many ways but it is unlikely that events
of the remaining years of the century
will bring us closer together.

Headache cure
Gives long-lasting relief from nervous disorders caused by congestion of the
business communications system.
The best way to get rid of a headache is
to eliminate the underlying cause. The
STC Pentaconta Pushbutton PABX does
just that for businesses suffering from the
strains created by slow, outdated tele-
phony. Pentaconta, the most advanced
business telephone system there is, puts
automation to work in the office, elimi-
nating the bottlenecks that slower systems
produce. Pentaconta also simplifies
switchboard operation, makes a good
impression on people, and helps a busi-
ness achieve a new level of overall
operating efficiency.
Big claims? But the STC Pentaconta is a
big step forward in telephony. If you are
accustomed to one of the older systems
you'll be surprised to discover what
advanced features are now available. For
example, in Pentaconta-equipped busi-
nesses it is no longer necessary to call the
operator to transfer a call to another
extension. An outside caller can, in fact,
arrange to be connected to a series of
extensions in sequence. His call will be
automatically re-directed to the operator
each time a conversation is terminated.
There are enough features to fill a book.
Ask us and we'll send you the book the
brochure on the Pentaconta, that is. The
Pentaconta comes in line capacities to
suit all businesses. Ask us to tell you more
about it and what it could do for you.

The Basic Wage Crisis
BY BRIAN BUCKLEY
MR. JIM ROBINSON usually applies
an air of stVeet reason as he puts the
merits of the employers’ case in the
present Arbitration Commission hear-
ing of the 1967 basic wage case. But
suddenly his sweet reasonableness took
a holiday when he told the Commis-
sion: “It is time this Tribunal dropped
its notion that a wage booster by the
Commission will assist the economy.
You tried it twice within six months
and that increase represented $435
million per annum . . . why don’t
you leave the problem of stimulating
consumer demand to the Common-
wealth Government? . . . We consider
you must drop this a-bit-of-both-ways
type of statement ... if it does not
have the desired result the Commis-
sion will say ‘Well, we did not rely on
It anyway.’ If it does have the desired
result the Commission may say, ‘There
you are.’ ”
Sir Richard Kirby: “Mr. Robinson,
I regard your submissions in this light
not only as incorrect, but grossly
improper ... I think they are a dis-
grace to your principals ... look over
the transcript overnight and I will be
ready to hear your apology tomorrow
morning.”
Mr. Robinson made a qualified
apology in the morning and it was
accepted by the Commission as a
■“handsome” one, the Chief Judge sup-
posing that on the day on which a
Test cricket match was about to begin
at the Melbourne Cricket Ground “a
few bumpers before lunch were
inevitable.”
Behind Mr. Robinson’s unusual dis-
courtesy was a basic uncertainty, as to
the criteria the Commission uses, a
problem which lies behind apparently
contradictory decisions. The majority
judgments of 1965 and 1966, for
example, are opposed in principle, and
the judgment of 1965 quite different
from that of 1961, and that of 1961
contradictory to a number of
judgments of the 19505.
All depends on whether the Bench
decides that its judicial or economic
functions are paramount. The Act
states that the chief objects of the Con-
ciliation and Arbitration Commission
are to promote goodwill in industry,
settle industrial disputes, etc., but it
also states that these objects are to
be achieved with reference to the
interests of society as a whole and to
the public interest.
At present it appears that Judges
Kirby, Wright, and Moore give greater
weight to the former objects of the Act,
whilst Judges Gallagher, Sweeney, and
Nimmo are more influenced by general
considerations of the public interest. In
practice one half of the Commission
is inclined to raise wages in accordance
with rises in prices and rises in pro-
ductivity, in view of the necessity to
promote industrial justice and harmony;
but the other half ,is concerned to keep
wages steady unless convinced that in-
dustry has a greater capacity to pay
and that a wage rise will not produce
problems in the economy at large.
There is, indeed, evidence that at
least one of the judges believes that
basic wage rises are of no substantial
benefit to families of the lowest-paid
workers.
As the judgments emerge each year
there tends to be some compromise be-
tween the two positions, • and the
further confusion amongst those who
have been trying to follow the argu-
ments of the basic wage case, and
some irritation amongst the contending
parties. Thus follows Mr. Robinson’s
charge that the Commission is “having-
it-a-bit-of-both-ways.”
The same kind of frustration last
year led the union advocate, Mr. Bob
Hawke, a master debater in the Arbitra-
Sir Richard Kirby
tion field, to accuse the Commission of
“humbug” in part of its 1965 majority
judgment, of conflicting with the law
which created the Commission, and of
being self-contradictory in its major
proposals.
Mr. Hawke won a victory last year
for the principle that the Commission
should be mostly concerned with wage
justice and not chiefly with the effects
of wage rises on promoting inflation, or
creating export and balance-of-payment
problems for the Australian economy.
The basic wage rise granted last year
did not, however, match the union vic-
tory in the matter of the jurisdiction of
the Commission. The unions are asking
for a rise of $3.70 in the basic wage
this time, and although everyone knows
they have little hope of getting that
much, the Commission may find it dif-
ficult to deny Mr. Hawke’s case that the
logic of last year’s decision should lead
to more substantial economic gains for
the workers.
Mr. Hawke is on strong grounds
when he argues that it is unfair for
the Commission to expect the lowest-
paid employees in the community to
bear the burden of fears of cost-
inflation when employers are not pro-
hibited by any legal means from rais-
ing prices, and when some employers
are protected by Government-imposed
tariffs.
Mr. Robinson has already put a
strong employers’ case for the intro-
duction of a total wage to replace the
present system of arbitration for both
the basic wage and margins. The Com-
mission last year showed clear signs
of being ready to accept the employers’
arguments for a total wage. The
unions are still opposed to these argu-
ments on the grounds that over a period
of time the lowest-paid workers would
suffer in comparison with what the
unions call “the tall poppies.” The best
that Mr. Hawke may be able to do
with the total wage is postpone its
introduction for six or 12 months.
Outside the details of the present
dispute lie the basic problems of how
wage justice can be granted so that
workers in the lower incomes do not
have increases absorbed by price rises,
so that wage rises are shared by industry
generally and not carried by those
which employ most labor, so that
appropriate account may be taken of
work value, and so that rises in wages
do not upset the balance of an economy
particularly sensitive to overseas trade.
The present Arbitration system has
a number of obvious virtues but it
cannot deal properly with the manner
in which fare rises, for example, steal
back from the worker his gains from
Arbitration; the way that transport
and other industries are hit by wage
rises but industries which employ few
unskilled or semi-skilled workers, e.g.,
the oil industry, are almost unaffected;
or the problems of absorbing wage
rises by increasing efficiency and pro-
ductivity.
It is likely that the present basic
wage case will confirm the manifest
logic of the 1966 majority decision,
but the wider economic and social
problems of Australian methods of
wage-fixation will remain. Granted
that there is some confusion in the
Conciliation and Arbitration Act itself,
it is not surprising that there is even
more confusion in the industrial area
which surrounds it. It might be
appropriate for the Commission to call
attention to its own legal' problems
and to the economic difficulties which
its decisions often create.


The Executive
BY APRIL HERSEY
FOR SUCCESS in the business world
it used to be enough to have (a) a
good suit, (b) a good car and (c) a
good house. Now it seems important to
put up a good show on all fronts. In
particular, what used to be Dad’s office
is now the executive suite and must re-
flect the man and the status and style
of his firm.
If it is all-Australian the decor should
make lavish use of native timbers; if it
is young and virile there must be a
touch of aggressiveness; if it is founded
in the old world of England or Ger-
many a set of prints may give the
needed definition; if it is American
there is a possibility that it may look
like a set from a Rock Hudson film.
The higher the canyons of glass and
steel rise in the cities the happier the
decorators are as they roll out the
rough, manly linens and order the steel
and leather chairs for their clients.
Saunas, kitchens, bars and cellars,
stereo, movie projectors, and sometimes
whole theatres are included. The cost
is often astronomical, particularly as
most of this field calls for a modern
decor, and modern office furniture is
by far the most expensive custom-
made furniture available. Not too many
executives can afford to work in an
atmosphere of dyed hessian and stripped

tanker in the dim distance.
oak, because their importance is strip-
ped with the varnish. Though one
executive in Sydney clung to his old
furniture, adding William Morris wall-
paper in royal-blues and limes, just to
show that he was really in the swing,
His decorator, Neville Marsh, has few
calls for traditional styling. The
majority of firms want a strictly modern
theme; though we did have one man
who asked for a modern mterpreta-
tion of the elegance of Louis XVI. He
didn’t want reproduction furniture, so
we had some made in a contemporary
style but based on the Louis XVI
period. I must say his board-room
finished up looking extremely luxurious
and a far cry from the awful motel
effect which so many board-rooms
have.
Like most decorators Marsh enjoys
working in the executive field. Apart
from'the wives of doctors who get him
to revamp dreary waiting-rooms,
watching hawk-eyed the while, most of
the arrangements are made in a very
businesslike way. The quote is accepted
or revised, a date of completion arrived
at, and the decorator is on his own
without changes being made. Even the
works of art are chosen with the
decorator, who takes the client to a
gallery. Despite the young image so
prevalent today no one has asked
Marsh to produce pop-art or even op-
art themes in decorating.
Marion Best is the lady who has
lavished color in the dreary old office
world. Her Finnish Printex fabrics,
glazed walls in orange and green and
brilliant Thai silks have dazzled many
a staid executive.
“I sometimes think they wonder for
a while what has hit them. They are so
used to having had their wives go along
to the man at Beard Watsons or Grace
Brothers. I usually know what I’m
going to find in a room that hasn’t
been touched. There will be a huge
plum-colored desk, and square dining-
room chairs for the clients. The board-
room will be weighed down with cedar
and mahogany. Often the executives
cling to some of these things—paintings
hung so far up that no one can see
them; or their father’s chair. Some-
times retaining a bit of the old is
good.
“For instance, when Wormald Bros,
moved their executives’ offices to the
AMP building, they planned to leave
behind them a fine mural that Douglas
Annand had done of fire engines
through the ages. I was determined to
have this. So we cut the plaster off
the wall piece by piece and brought it
into town. The artist would have noth-
ing to do with us, so my head painter
had to do the job. We patched it
all up again and made it the focal
point of the new offices. Old furniture
and a collection of Georgian glass were
also kept in that executive suite and
a model of an early fire engine in a
glass case was placed on a specially
designed table standing on a red rug.
“The whole thing has got right away
from the old-style office,” Lady Hall
Best commented. “The American idea
of having a sort of living-room office
has now caught on in Sydney. It was
pretty much unheard of as late as 1960.
I arrange intimate corners with a light
hanging low over a table and comfort-
able chairs where they can relax while
they are talking.”
This doesn’t relax the executives
entirely since there is sometimes diffi-
culty in pinning them down to a bud-
get for the work involved.
One hard-headed businessman de-
cided Lady Hall Best was a “bush-
ranger” and she didn’t get as far as his
board-room. “But they usually realise
that Charles Eames chairs and Herman


Miller furniture are costly. The result
is well worth it,” she said.
Costing the job must be something
of a joy. At Artes Studios, a firm very
much to the fore in the executive
decorating field, there was a serious
discussion going on when I called.
“But it only comes to $22,000.”
“There must be a mistake. How
many chairs?”
“There are twenty-eight chairs at
$l4O each.”
“You have partitioning —carpet—
what about the refrigerated cocktail
cabinet? Have you included that?
And what about the foyer? Isn’t he
having curtains?”
“He doesn’t want curtains.”
“Oh, I think you should talk to him
again.”
Indeed! An executive without cur-
tains is no executive at all.
“Everything is much lighter and
brighter now,” their sales manager said.
“So much more stimulating. We are
asked to include works of art- —even
sculpture.”
Artes Studios receive an architect’s
plan to which the key is pinned. They
arrange the office partitioning, plan
color schemes, provide everything
throughout — 1 furniture, desks, type-
writers, adding machines, right down
to the tin of cleaning powder under
the kitchen sink.
“All the business firms have to do is
bring in the papers and the people,”
said the sales manager.
One of their latest clients, South
African Airways, can expect extremely
rich carpeting, glowing palisander
panelling, dignified leather, accents of
copper and brilliant color introduced in
the fabrics.
Sometimes home decorating leads to
office decorating, sometimes it is the
other way about.
Bill Northam has no yachts in his
office at Johnson and Johnson, though
the same decorator, Barry Little, has
enshrined them in his home. At Caltex
House the board-room has a Far
Eastern theme, “Chinese modern with
shoji screens,” Barry Little recalled. His
latest job is to project the image of
Strata Development Corporation on the
top floor of a block of flats which will
contain the executive suite for the
present time. Max Bowen and his asso-
ciates are looking for dignity plus the
feeling of having a go-ahead concern.
Over at Lend Lease they are big on
concrete, glass, and the functional. Mr.
R. C. Crebbin, of Marrickville Mar-
garine, is a little sensitive about what
one reporter has described as a “luxuri-
ously furnished office.” So all we can
say is that it is a long way from Mrs.
The board-room in CSR’s old headquarters in Sydney, now demolished. We have
been told that furniture and fittings such as these are very much in demand by
the smartest New York decorators, anxious to persuade their clients to discard
modern anonymous in favor of something with character

Women, of course, set a different
style. While Sheila Scotter, of Australian
“Vogue,” works at a round white
laminated table, which can be hastily
cleared off for an elegant luncheon,
Norma Tullo is in a world of ivy and
carved oak in Melbourne. There is a
deep blue carpet on the floor, charming
tables covered to the floor in fabric, a
flutter of white organdie at the window,
a fire in the grate. Her board-room is
bedecked with bound copies of the
“London Illustrated News” of the past
century, and around the old table are
chairs upholstered in crimson.
And, thanks to decorator Babette
Hayes, there is one woman solicitor in
Sydney who has art nouveau wallpaper
and fabric and seats her clients on an
elegant chaise-longue.


MT. NEWMAN "A Quarry for the Eastern States"
The Mt. Newman iron ore deal means about sB|- million in
royalties on contracts already signed of 170 million tons (out
of reserves of 1000 million tons) to veteran prospector Stan
Hilditch, who found the deposits in the north of W.A., and
Charles Warman, the mining engineer who financed the search.
Reticent (they won’t admit how much they stand to get)
and publicity-shy (this is the first published picture of them
together), these two men in their sixties, who were old friends
in the goldmining business in Kalgoorlie, formed a partnership
in 1955 to look for manganese. Instead they found iron ore
in 1956, but because of the export embargo “the only person
we told was my wife,” said Hilditch. When the embargo was
lifted in 1960, they immediately pegged their claim.
TO A LOT OF Western Australians it
does not matter much that Mt. New-
man is Australia’s biggest iron ore de-
velopment (existing contracts total
about $l2OO million worth of ore, with
the prospect of much .more to come),
or that it is Australia’s biggest-ever
business deal, or that it is the only iron
ore project with Australians holding the
majority interest. To them, the signifi-
cant news of last week’s signing of the
Mt. Newman deal by Premier Brand
was in the details of the project that
gave some indication of the price BHP
had extracted from the other partners
and the State Government in rescuing
this project from collapse.
It was a price, they claim, that puts
BHP in firm control of the major part
of W.A.’s iron ore reserves, makes it
unlikely that an iron and steel industry
will grow in W.A. out of the Mt. New-
man reserves (probably Australia’s
richest), and leaves W.A. as “a quarry
for the Eastern States.” For BHP
is to take more than a third of Mt.
Newman’s iron ore ship,ments each year
around to its steelworks in N.S.W. at
prices that are rumored to be very
low indeed, but which are being kept
strictly secret. Exporting 70 million tons
of ore to N.S.W. strikes vocal Western
Australians as far more offensive than
selling 100 million tons to Japan.
“With CSR running the Common-
wealth Government and BHP running
the State, what chance have we got?”
says Lang Hancock, the man who dis-
covered one of W.A.’s biggest iron ore
reserves.
' And BHP which is now managing
Mt. Newman—is coincidentally getting
the contract to supply the project with
a lot of its requirements, like the 60,000
tons of rails that are to go into the
265-mile railway from Mt. Whaleback
to Port Hedland. Without BHP the
whole project was foundering. Despite
cheerful comments “off the record”
from CSR over the past few years,
mounting costs and wrong guesstimates
had meant that it took (in Premier
Brand’s revealing words) “two years of
exhausting and testing negotiations to
help overcome severe financial, physical,
and other problems.” And Sir James
Vernon revealed at the launching cere-
mony that CSR was on the verge of
pulling out of the whole thing “several
times.”
The eventual deal is remarkable not
only for the fact that Australia’s major
life assurance offices and banks have
joined in its financing in a big way (a
pleasant change from their fixation on
city office blocks), but that the scheme
brings Australian, American, Japanese,
and British interests together in a real
international venture. The project is
now owned 30 percent by BHP, 30 per-
cent by a subsidiary of Colonial Sugar
Refining (but in which the AMP
Society and other life offices hold a
third of the capital), 25 percent by
American Metal Climax (Amax),
which first decided to work the area,
10 percent split between the Japanese
companies Mitsui (7|) and C. Itoh
(2J), and the remaining 5 percent by
the British mining group Selection
Trust. But Selection Trust is not play-
ing such a minor role as it seems. It
By MICHAEL BAUME
also owns a 12 percent share in Amax
and has a say in its management.
Before costs got out of hand, this
had originally been a joint venture be-
tween CSR and Amax. The coming of
BHP to the group not only added great
strength to the participants, it also—
and possibly even more importantly —
added two-thirds to the size of the
iron ore contracts, making the whole
thing economically feasible.
What is in it for BHP? Mt. Newman
ore will cost it more than BHP’s own
iron ore deposits at Yampi Sound and
Iron Knob. But it will not be much
more. And the big attraction of this
project for BHP is that it is arranged
so that BHP will in reality be getting
about 70 million tons of ore almost free
of cost to itself, as its share of the pro-
ceeds of exports to Japan will pay for
its own ore buying—apart from its capi-
tal commitments to the project of about
$6O million (to be financed, by the way,
from its own funds). BHP is not telling
what the price is because it does not
want the Japanese to know what sort
of a good deal it has done with itself.
BHP is certainly not being benevo-
lent. It is going to need a lot more
iron ore soon as its massive expansion
program continues. At present, BHP
uses 7 million tons of iron ore a year;
in seven years’ time it will be taking
another 4 million tons from Mt. New-
man, to give some indication of the
sort of rise (about 60 percent) the
company plans to . make in steel pro-
duction by then.
The project is costing about $2OO
million altogether—and half of that is
being spent in railways ($4O million)
and ports ($6O million). But why pick
Port Hedland as the port? There are
some people in the West who regard
it as ridiculous to spend about $6O
million developing the shallow and man-
grove-swampy harbor at Port Hedland
to take 60,000 tonners (and event-
ually 100,000 tonners). There are all
sorts of schemes showing how other
ports would be less costly to build,
would be usable by other ore de-
velopers to reduce their average costs
even further.
But if this is a disadvantage, there is
one major advantage coming Mt. New-
man’s way. The Mount Newman
venturers are required under their con-
tract to set up an iron and steel indus-
try in W.A. in 20 years or so, but al-
ready there is every indication that they
will not have to do so.
Newman’s rival ore developer, Ham-
ersley Iron, had to agree to build a
steelworks in W.A. before it got
approval to develop the large Mt. Tom
Price iron ore deposits; now the
chances are that the State Govern-
ment’s “flexible approach” to the prob-
lem will mean that Mt. Newman could
probably get out of it with a bene-
ficiating plant. For there are strong dis-
advantages about adding a second steel-
works in W.A. to the one now being
built by BHP at Kwinana, and a third
would be ludicrous. For a steelworks
has to be very close to at least two of
three main requirements—iron ore, coal,
and markets. In W.A. the only thing
very near the site of the iron ore is
more iron ore.

OVERSEAS
Insurgency in Thailand:
the first round
IN A SERIES of Press reports and in-
spired disclosures, the authorities in
Thailand have begun focusing atten-
tion on subversion inside Thailand much
more thoroughly than ever before. Not
a week passes without publication of
some news in the local Press about the
killing of terrorists, the ambush of
police patrols, or defection of former
Communists to the Government side.
A vague pattern is now emerging in
the reports of disorder and subversion
inside Thailand. The most significant
thing is that in this pattern disturbances
in the Central Plains of Thailand figure
almost as prominently as subversion in
the South and North-east. Observers,
therefore, may not be far wrong-
in drawing the conclusion that anti-
Government agitation in Thailand, if
it is not intensifying, is at least extend-
ing in area, threatening to engage the
Government in many new sectors.
During a visit to Petchburi province
in the Central Plains last month, I
heard reports of increased Communist
activities in the jungles as well as of
repeated battles between the police
force and terrorists. One educated Thai
who lives in the area said that although
one could not guess the strength of
terrorists in the area he had seen many
Thailand’s Prime Minister,
Thanom Kittikachorn
indications that terrorists were pretty
well organised in the jungles and had,
to a large measure, neutralised the
village population, in some cases by
organising small-scale social work in
remote villages. He felt that one factor
which contributed to the success of the
guerilla operation is the presence in it
of a former MP who fled Bangkok when
the late Prime Minister Sarit abrogated
the Constitution. His presence gives the
terrorist operation in the area a certain
degree of respectability, if not a popular
touch. According to some observers in
Bangkok, this may also be happening
in other areas.
Government announcements and
Press reports available in Bangkok,
which seldom analyse the situation, now
A Far Eastern
Economic Review Report
from A. B. Santosh
indicate the concern the authorities feel
about the Central provinces and the
South. In January, Prime Minister
Thanom Kittikachorn told a Press con-
ference that 122 Communist suspects
had been arrested in the Central Plains
provinces of Suphanburi, Kanchana-
buri, Rajburi, Petchburi, and Prachuab
Kirikhan, and threatened that the
special powers of Article 17 of the
Interim Constitution (which could
mean summary execution of suspects)
may be used in dealing with the situa-
tion. The Prime Minister identified
the suspects as “Thai-born Chinese”
who had slipped out to Communist
China for training and slipped back
to carry out acts of subversion. He
also mentioned by name Payome Chul-
anon, a former MP from Petchburi who
was reported to be trying to organise
terrorist activities from Suphanburi
southwards. The Prime Minister’s Press
conference also brought the significant
disclosure that intense personal rivalry
between the Governor and the Director-
General of Police in the area had con-
siderably weakened the administration.
For foreign observers in Bangkok,
these official statements have some use,
but there is a certain danger in relying
on them too much, without comparing
them with information, however limited,
gathered from other sources. Addressing
a Press conference on February 27, the
Prime Minister said that in many res-
pects Red terrorists had grown “more
active” in the North-east, but on March
6 he gave a more heartening report
of “lessening Red activity” in the same
area. If his reports are based on week-
to-week police accounts from the North-
east and this explains how a situation
which is rather grim one week becomes
heartening the following week one
must admit that Government fortunes
iti the North-east are fluctuating and
that there are no permanent losses or
gains by either side in brief, the
situation is highly unstable. Foreign
correspondents and experts who often
go out to the North-east have precious
little to add, in terms of hard news, to
what is already known here on the
basis of information supplied by the
Government. But they return to Bang-
kok with a “feel” for the North-east,
and are almost unanimous in their
opinion that the situation there has
become more sensitive and delicate,
while the pace of development in the
area can hardly be described as impres-
sive.
In places like Übol, Udorn, Sakorn
Nakorn, and Kon Kan, one gets the
impression of living in towns whose
main purpose is to cater to the needs —
and pleasure—of continually increasing
American troops in these bases. Night-
clubs and bars have mushroomed in
hundreds and young girls have left
their homes in nearby villages in search
of money and a glamorous life with the
Gls. Forces of disintegration play their
part; social imbalances have rendered
the situation more unstable and delicate
than ever. All this has undoubtedly
given towns in the North-east a glow of
temporary prosperity, but it provides no
immediate benefits to the countryside,
which offers shelter to terrorists and
where the real battles against guerillas
are fought week after week. On the
other hand, the situation lends enormous
support and authenticality to the “Thai
Patriotic Front” propaganda against the
so-called American occupation of Thai-
land.
If the Government is unwittingly pro-
viding ammunitions for the propaganda
of the Front, it has also so far failed
to establish an effective radio network
for the counter-attack. In most of these
places especially at Udorn, which is
closest to the Laos border, the entry
point for infiltrators the reception of
short-wave broadcasts from the Public
Relations Broadcasting Station in Bang-
kok is hopelessly weak. When the radio
is tuned in, one hears the broadcasts
from the “Thai Patriotic Front,” pos-
sibly from Hanoi. There are now plans
to set up a 55 kw MW station at Khon
Kaen, which may serve the area better


Street scene, Bangkok
than the short-wave broadcasts from
Bangkok. But it is reported that the new
station will be manned by Americans,
which will be a mistake since it will
provide fresh arguments to the Front’s
thesis about the so-called American
occupation of the area. Incidentally,
TV broadcasts and their receptions are
much better, but the political contents
of TV programs are decidedly poor.
Most impartial observers here believe
that it would be a mistake for the
authorities to underestimate the impact
broadcasts from the “Thai Patriotic
Front” radio has on people in different
parts of Thailand. For one thing,
broadcasts can be heard very clearly
almost anywhere in the country. These
broadcasts, which can be heard three
times a day, are well organised and
they are aimed at Thai listeners in all
parts of the country. It has its own news
bulletin (which I listened to a few
times) which, as a Thai friend once
said, is up to date, fresh, and highly
analytical “infinitely superior to any-
thing one can read in the Bangkok
Press.” In fact, it gave better cover-
ages to the recent flood havoc in the
South than Bangkok newspapers. If it
showers abuses on Thanom and Prapas,
it also provides listeners with sharp
analysis on such questions as the delay
in the promulgation of the Constitution,
Thailand’s role in Vietnam, the purpose
of Johnson’s visit to Thailand indeed
on issues which cannot even be discussed
by newspapers in Bangkok. In some re-
spects, therefore, broadcasts from the
Front radio fill in the vacuum that
exists in the country because of the
absence of a free and uncontrolled
Press.
Slowly but persistently, the Front thus
carries on its invisible war to win over
the minds of the people, and to
neutralise those who would have been
otherwise on the side of the Govern-
ment. After all, in the absence of a
popular parliament and a democrati-
cally elected government, and with the
consequent decline in political thinking,
the North-east, which played an effective
role in Thailand’s political life before
the abrogation of the Constitution by
Sarit, has become a fertile ground for
any kind of effective and meaningful
political indoctrination.
“The situation is not hopeless,” said
a Thai ex-politician recently, “but we
feel dismayed by the Government’s
choice of wrong methods in dealing
with the situation, methods which make
it difficult for someone like me to
meet the Government halfway.” As
long as the authorities rely on military
measures to deal with the problem, he
said, their dependence on American
help will increase (which is now hap-
pening), and the Government will lose
more and more ground politically. On
the other hand, if the Government
should decide to apply a political solu-
tion, while maintaining military alert-
ness, the most meaningful course of
action would be the promulgation of a
democratic Constitution, amnesty for
all former politicians, and willingness
on the part of Thanom and Prapas to
quit office in favor of a truly democratic
government.
Apparently, the Government has no
desire to try this, for the simple reason
that it is convinced the agitation in the
North-east, South and Central Plains is
Communist-inspired, directly aided and
supported by North Vietnam and
China, and not just a movement which
may have its main objective realised
once the country is put back on the
road to real democracy. If some are
dismayed by the Government’s failure
to choose a political solution, others
are antagonised by the failure of the
authorities to give the country a clean,
corruption-free administration, by the
country’s increasingly deep involvement
in the Vietnam war, and by the con-
tinued disintegration of the social fabric
in towns and cities under the pressure
of the American presence in Thailand.
All these give rise to cynicism and des-
pondency, making an increasing number
of people search for a different course.
Unfortunately, the “other course” is
not easy to find. Perhaps much depends
on the Vietnam war and on the pros-
pects of peace. In the event of a mas-
sive American withdrawal from the
region, the Government will be forced
to think of a meaningful political course
of action to deal with the problem. But
will it then be too late to try out
methods which the authorities can ex-
periment with now, perhaps with a
fair degree of success?
Should India's aid be cut?
INDIA’S FOURTH five-year plan has
hit the worst possible combination of
circumstances. The investment program
of the plan, which runs from 1966 to
1971, requires a particularly heavy load
of foreign aid in 1967 and 1968
roughly double the level of the aid sup-
plied in the mid-1960s before the
expected sharp rundown in the balance
of payments deficit begins in 1969.
The planners have convinced themselves
that they will be able to achieve balance
by the second half of the 19705, if only
they can go forward with the big push
now. But recently the main aid-givers
have thought more of cuts than of in-
creases. On Thursday the consortium
agreed, apart from food aid, on roughly
$9OO million in non-project aid for the
coming year; on project aid it said not
a word
' r, • • jo
Ihe United States, Britain, and Ger-
many, which together supply around
two-thirds of India’s aid, are all in
balance of payments trouble; and aid, in
the post-cold-war period, is dispensable.
There is also a widespread feeling in
the West that the Indian development
program has gone sour. The ghastly
photographs of famine, the long delays
over the fertiliser production program
have suggested that it is not making any
significant impact. So that just when
India is nearing the hump, the will to
give it a heave over the top has
lessened.
This conjunction of increased Indian
needs and slackening Western interest
i s beginning to be reflected in a new
mood in India itself. There are signs
of a search for an alternative road
through the bleak middle years ahead,
which are, in any case, unlikely to pro-
duce any significant improvement in
average living standards until the
1980 s. There is serious talk of slashing
the long-term program of industrial
development, and concentrating single-
mindedly on agriculture; of a regime
°f austeri ty, mitigated only by an all-
out effort to complete, as soon as pos-
sible> t h e industrial investment projects
that look i ike yielding quick returns,
This alternative emerged as one of the
themes at a conference, run jointly by
Chatham House, the University of
Sussex, and the Institute of Develop-

ment Studies, at Brighton last week-
end. It was examined at length in the
presence of senior Indian planners.
The argument for cutting down
foreign-aid requirements can be quite
strong from an Indian point of view.
There is growing popular resentment
centring on the uncertainties, the in-
dignities, and the alleged distortions of
certain Indian domestic policies which
accompany the charity of foreigners. No
one suggests India can live without
charity altogether. But, it is averred, the
proper course is to start cutting it down
now, instead of devising programs on
the fading assumption of an increase
over the next couple of years.
What emerged from examination of
this counter-plan was that in the short,
and perhaps even the medium, term it
might make very little difference to the
living standards of the average Indian.
Some people even suggested that by
mobilising the forces of nationalism
it might secure the effort and discipline
that have been lacking hitherto.
The damage, however, would be felt
in the early 19705. By then the fourth
plan envisages that the industrial base,
above all in machine-building, will be
largely in place, and the country will be
on the brink of self-sustaining growth.
Whether this really happens so soon
or not, the alternative course offers very
little prospect of an Indian industrial
breakthrough until much later on.
And the striking thing is, when all
the dollars of the present plan are
added up, how relatively small the total
seems to be: excluding most food aid,
about $4 billion. On the basis of the
present perspective plan, which goes as
far as 1980-81, India will need over the
whole 15 years some $lB billion of
foreign aid. During the same period
the repayments and interest falling due
come to $l4 billion. After 1975, the
expected repayments would actually
outstrip expected inflows of capital, but
even before that the proportion of
money going out of India compared
to that coming in would be rising.
How many Chinese are there?
SINCE 1960 many Chinese leaders
keep on calling China the “world’s
most powerful country of 700 million
people.” This repetition of the magic
number “700 million” seems to suggest
that the population of China has not
increased since then. Yet Chan-
drasekhar, one of the world’s foremost
demographers, recently wrote that
China’s population was about 800 mil-
lion, and was now increasing at an
annual rate of about 2.2 percent.
Why do the Chinese leaders under-
state the size of their population? The
reason might be that orthodox Marxists
are in a quandary about the frightening
results of a fast-declining death-rate
and a stationary, high birth-rate—a
calamity forecast more than 150 years
ago by Malthus. Although death
control without birth control can be
the greatest obstacle to a rising stan-
dard of living, Karl Marx denounced
the writings of Malthus as valid only
in an “exploiting society”; in a socialist
economy without exploiting capitalists
all the production is supposed to go to
the working people, and the more
people work, the higher will be produc-
tion. Population control seems to be
contradictory to Mao’s writings; the
masses, properly organised in a socialist
community, can achieve anything; suc-
cessful defence, adequate food supply,
and in general a superior way of life.
Perhaps this explains the tragic waver-
ing on birth control in China.
Dr. Ma Yin-Chu, president of Peking
University, was one of the strongest
advocates of population control, but he
was dismissed from his position when,
in his “New Theory of Population,” he
tried to prove that China’s fast popula-
tion increase was a great obstacle to a
rising standard of living.
It is significant that the first large-
scale birth-control campaign com-
menced in 1954, when the food situa-
tion was not good and when China’s
“first modern census” in 1953 revealed
a much higher population than
expected 583 million. But when in
1958 the “Great Leap Forward” tried
to communise China in a year or two,
emphasising the strength of the masses
as the basis for economic progress, birth
control became a dangerous subject.
In the past five years, however, family
planning has again become a virtue.
The Red Guards are encouraged not to
marry before they are 28 for men and
25 for women, and to limit their
children to two. Sterilisation, especi-
ally for men, is propagated, abortions
are legal, and all contraceptives are
freely available, except the oral pill.
Perhaps the prospect of one billion
people by 1984 frightens even orthodox
Chinese Marxists.


ARTS AND ENTERTAINMENT
A score of forgettable films
By CHARLES HIGHAM
ONE OF THOSE solidly reliable minor
actors who pass unobtrusively through
the history of the cinema, Ron Ran-
dell admits with engaging candor that
nearly all his films have been box-
office flops, most notably the spectacu-
lar disaster “King of Kings,” famous
forever for Jeffrey Hunter’s hairless
armpits on the cross. Here to star in
“There’s a Girl in My Soup” for
J. C. Williamson, Randell had last re-
visited his native Sydney for the
premiere of that dreadful film. “So
many religious groups tried to have
a hand in the picture that it ended
up a complete mess. And they cast
somebody like Jeffrey Hunter with
pretty face and blue eyes.
“You know, something strange hap-
pened on that picture; Jeffrey Hunter
had just come down from the Cross
for a rest. Suddenly a storm broke
out. A huge black cloud every*
thing went black. Somebody said,.
‘That’s just how it must have been,
when—.’ The Spaniards we made
the picture in Spain were para-
lysed. We should have shot the storm
but the whole unit was in such a
state of confusion we just couldn’t get
it on to film.”
Randell first went to America in
1943, dodged submarines by Swedish
steamer in an effort to reach the Mayo
Clinic in time to save his life from
sinus trouble contracted in the Army.
He appeared with Nancy Carroll in
“Mr. and Mrs. North” in San Fran-
cisco, and just missed death when by
a fluke he missed a ship heading home
from New York; it was sunk by enemy
action in the Caribbean. Later, in
Sydney, Randell starred as Kingsford
Smith in “Smithy,” and won a Holly-
wood contract, joining the Hollywood
Australian community headed by Ann
Richards and Michael Pate. He
appeared in a score of forgettable pic-
tures, including a wretched version of
“Carmen” with Rita Rayworth, whom
he very much liked and admired. Since
then he has been cast in dud film after
dud film, doings rather better on the
stage (“The World of Suzie Wong,”
“Candida”).
He had much enjoyed, in recent
years, working on the brilliant science
fiction “Outer Limits” TV series with
the producer, Joe Stefano, and the direc-
tor, Gerd Oswald. He had appeared
in “The Duplicate Man” as two
human beings exactly identical except
for a difference of mental outlook. Ran-
dell had tested for the pilot of a series
planned by Stefano, “The Haunted”
about a man hired to uncover the cause
and hauntings in Californian towns; to
his bitter disappointment, the part had
gone to Martin Landau, and the pilot
had been shelved.
One of his harrowing assign-
ments had been on a film called “The
Hostage,” made in England. He was
supposed to be the pilot of a plane
who has to leave the controls to push
a coffin out of the -back, and he in-
sisted on doing his own stunt. The
scene had to be shot on a backless
plane from another plane flying near-
by; the pilot had to leave the pilot’s
seat so he wouldn’t be seen in the shot
with Randell. “There was no auto-
matic pilot, and there I was pushing
the coffin into space. If the plane had
been caught in an updraught—finish. I’d
have been out of the plane with the
coffin. And the plane was flying by
itself.” And all this for a picture nobody
saw and historians have forgotten . . .
On Darryl F. Zanuck’s D-Day story
“The Longest Day,” Randell played
the part of an American war corres-
pondent. “If anybody fluffed a line on
that famous beach-landing scene, 4000
men had to go back in the sea and do
the invasion of Europe all over again.
I remember one French star, who shall
be nameless, had to die 11 times before
he got the scene right. Those 4000 men
had to march 11 times out of the water
because of him. You can imagine what
they were saying the eleventh time . . .
“There’s a scene where I have to send
a dispatch and somebody suggests I
use carrier pigeons. I’m just about to
send them off when there’s a huge
explosion and the pigeons are scat-
tered. I had to ad-lib a line to cover the
reaction of the character to the ex-
plosion. I yelled, ‘Your f ing
pigeons!’ at the man who’d recom-
mended them. When we came to dub
the picture, Darryl F. Zanuck sent an
inquiry, ‘What did he say when the
explosion went off?’ I didn’t dare tell
him. So when the scene was processed
it came out as ‘Your bloody pigeons!’
He still doesn’t know what I really
said.”

Night after night
By FRANK ROBERTS
AFTER THE FIRST five half-hours of
“These Days Tonights,” I found my-
self longing for the Bert Newton
“Tonight” show planned for Saturday
nights later in the month, which indi-
cates what a depressed state I was in.
I will say this, more or less jokingly:
“TDT” has already, in only one week,
become almost what the ABC’s 7.15
“Newsreel” should have been; and it is
decidedly better than “Weekend Maga-
zine.” Its title is unfortunate, because
it leads me to expect reflections of the
day’s news events, but with rare excep-
tions so far this is not so.
It must also have a problem in its
plan to do things quickly so that it wilL
not conflict with “Four Corners,” which
does similar things more thoroughly.
Avoiding similar ABC subjects is pos-
sible, but one night last week I’ll swear
they interviewed the same British
migrant, in Sydney, that Peter Wester-
way had spoken to, in Brisbane, the-
previous night.
Time, too, is difficult to judge without
the 20-year skill of a Bob Dyer, if
you’re doing it as you go, but the
“TDT” crew isn’t. Why, then, did they
allow a Catholic Bishop to say nothing
interminably, and on another night cut
Barry Jones in mid-sentence after only
two minutes or so, when for once he
was trying to say something worth hear-
ing?
Nor did I understand that “TDT” -
would be tied to the coaxial cable and
coaxial Sydney-Canberra-Melbourne. A


half-hour big budget show should be
able to reflect more of the life of this
big country. I had expected the pro-
ducers to have stock film to suit all
kinds of occasions at very many places.
I liked the style of a “confrontation”
between Kent Hughes and Bryant,
mainly because it showed our “hawk”
as a more reasonable man than he is
ever reported, and one of our “doves”
likewise; the total, two apparently
reasonable, politically opposed men get-
ting along without snarls. That seemed
good TV journalism.
Summing up, I cannot agree with
the reviewers who have found so much
to praise in “This Day Tonight.” To
me its only benefit so far appears to
be the negative one of forcing ABC
News and “Four Corners” to sharpen
their ways not a bad thing, but not
enough to keep the show in business.
I do not know what “TDT” is trying
to do, or be; I doubt its crew does,
either, although they should by now.
However, my views should raise a cheer
at the ABC, being almost a guarantee
that the show will win high awards at
every television prize-giving, from the
Lawson Festival to next year’s Logies.
Theatre
With menace
By MADELEINE ARMSTRONG
The Homecoming. Harold Pinter. Old
Tote, Sydney.
The Collection. Harold Pinter. Q
Group, AMP Theatrette, Sydney.
IN PINTER’S PLAYS there has
always been an atmosphere of menace.
In the early plays it was outside the
room, looming but shadowy and
undefined. While critics argued
whether the menace had any meaning
or was just a prop, all were agreed
that it was compellingly theatrical.
Gradually, in his later plays, Pinter has
been bringing the menace inside the
room and embodying it in the charac-
ters. In “The Caretaker” it was still
inclined to float about the room in a
rather disembodied way like poor Mrs.
Gradgrind’s pain. In his one-act play
“The Collection,” the mystery and
menace are mainly psychological, but,
irritatingly, are still eked out by a
certain amount of Hitchcockery —mys-
terious telephone calls and sudden
knockings on doors.
But in his latest play, “The Home-
coming,” Pinter has finally succeeded
in making the menace completely
psychological: the air is thick with
aggression and lust. All this is expressed
in Pinter’s characteristic dialogue - —•
compressed, flat, and heavy with pauses.
This is the theatre of the pregnant
PICTURE BY ROBERT WALKER
Tom Oliver and Charles Little in “The Homecoming.” Old Tote, Sydney
pause during which the imperfectly
expressed meanings are apprehended.
Nevertheless, Pinter is a master of
dialogue and nowhere is this seen more
clearly than in “The Homecoming,” in
which a lot of the macabre comedy
arises from the contrast between the
pious, cliche-filled speeches the charac-
ters make about their life as a family
and the actual appalling facts of that
life.
Teddy, who teaches philosophy at
an American university, returns to
London to see his old father, bringing
with him his wife, Ruth, whom the
family have not met. The family con-
sists of Max, a retired butcher, his
brother Sam, a chauffeur, his second
son, Lenny, a ponce, and his youngest
son, Joey, a laborer and unsuccessful
boxer. As soon as Max sees Ruth he
realises she is a natural whore, like
his dead wife, Jessie. When the brothers
also realise this, much later, they invite
her to stay, “to keep them company.”
Then Lenny, the professional, encour-
aged by Max, perfects the invitation by
offering to put Ruth “on the game”
so that she can keep herself in the
style to which she is accustomed. Ruth,
beautiful, sensual, a veritable Circe,
has indeed come home, for in this house
she can queen it unchallenged, with
the three men her willing slaves. Teddy
returns to America without her, con-
soled only by the belief that he under-
stands the struggle, even if he has lost.
The action of the play is like that
of a dream: both mad and coherent,
farcical and realistic. I am never sure
what Pinter is trying to do in his plays,
nor how serious he is, but I think “The
Homecoming” is a play to be seen.
John Clark’s excellent production is a
very careful exercise in timing to bring
out both the grimness and the comedy
in the play. The humor is often
sinister; some of it, like the philo-
sophical discussion between Lenny and
Teddy, seems gratuitous, but it is very
funny, and John Clark, in the coffee-
drinking episode, has added a delight-
ful passage of farcical embroidery. The
somewhat baroque setting by Ron Reid
is matched in style by the six excellent
performances.
The “Q’s” production of “The Col-
lection” is not quite taut enough, but
it is a happy coincidence that it is
showing at the same time as “The
Homecoming.”
Other Victorians
By PHILLIP ADAMS
The Right Honorable Gentleman. M.
Bradley-Dyne. Russell Street, Mel-
bourne.
IT IS A PLEASURE and a privilege
to vote for a Victorian politician. One
knows one’s candidate irrespective of
party is a man of the highest moral
tone. Take Sir Henry’s Liberal Govern-
ment. Front and back benchers alike are
men of almost militant chastity.
But what of those “other Victorians”:’
What of Gladstone’s Liberals? Mr.
Bradley-Dyne has revealed all, and a
scandalous all it is. For while Right
Honorables like Sir Charles Dilke and
Joseph Chamberlain were preaching
Home Rule for Ireland, they were in-
volved in goings-on which make the
Profumo affair read like Milly-Molly-
Mandy.
Sir Charles Dilke was front-runner
for the Colonial Secretaryship, Glad-
stone had named him heir-apparent to
the party leadership, and the 1885 elec-
tions were only weeks away. Then, a
divorce scandal broke about his noble
head. Worse still, Hyphen-Dyne suggests
it was manipulated by Chamberlain for
his own political advantage; and Cham-
berlain was Dilke’s best friend. A Mrs.
Crawford, seeking freedom from her
ramrod (yet apparently impotent)
Scottish husband, had named Dilke as
her seducer.
Dilke denied all charges, accusing the
girl of being an hysteric. Alternatively,
she had named Dilke to protect a real
lover. And in either case, she was under
the influence of a mother who, having
been Dilke’s mistress, had been damn-
ing him in poison-pen letters for years.
Bradley-Dyne gives us both view-


points quite impartially, tosses in some
Freudian red-herrings, and leaves us
entirely in the dark. Did Dilke or didn’t
he? We’re never told. But what is clear
is that while Dilke may have been
innocent of the specific charges, be-
cause of his immoral irresponsibility
with the mother, he shared the moral
responsibility for the character of the
daughter.
This is the best single production
of John Sumner’s I’ve seen. “The Right
Honorable Gentleman” is not an im-
portant play, but it is splendid theatre.
Raymond Westwell’s performance as
Dilke was as sharp and “period” as a
steel engraving, conveying the man’s
political and sexual passions with equal
intensity. Elspeth Ballantyne had initial
difficulties with Mrs. Crawford, but
by the end of the play had achieved
complete conviction. Brigid Lenihan
impressed as her hot-blooded, mum,
while Frank Thring didn’t as Chamber-
lain, although his Act II entrance was
hilarious.
“A few flowers fresh from the coun-
try,” he announced with sinister gaiety,
presenting Dilke with a basket full of
polythene roses fresh from the factory.
As usual, Prins’ sets and Fredrikson’s
costumes were first class.
Music
Among friends
By DAVID SALTER
The Deller Consort. Town Hall, Syd-
ney.
Dorothy White. Harpsichord, Cell
Block Theatre, Sydney.
SQUEEZED IN a crescent shape on
chairs bordering three sides of a nar-
row table, the six members of the
Deller Consort manage to give the
impression that in attending one of their
performances, you have been graciously
admitted to something quite private
and “among friends.” The changes
in program which Deller announced
to the audience throughout the even-
ing seemed like the random follow-
ings of whim which characterise the
relaxed rehearsals of an amateur
choir. The sounds which the Consort
generate are in their warmth and in-
tensity a reflection of this almost
homely attitude to public performance.
With Deller half-conducting from one
side, heads bent in concentration over
every part and the glorious textural
possibilities of well-matched voices, the
group promised and produced a recital
of extreme beauty.
The most interesting (and best per-
formed) music of the program was the
bracket of madrigals by the Italian
Renaissance eccentric Carlo Gesualdo.
With the microtonal experiments of
Vincentino, Gesualdo’s madrigals rank
as the most startling evidence of ex-
pressive freedom which was enjoyed
in that period. The Consort revelled
in the disso'nances of interlocking sus-
pensions, compound chromaticism, and
the remarkable harmonic vocabulary
of this music. Deller’s attention to
detail here served to further heighten
the spirit of emotional violence and
despair.
Debussy’s “Trois Chansons de Charles
d’Orleans,” while it did display the
group’s fluency in more modern music,
served also to confirm the stature of
its members as individual musicians.
The distilled, wispy quality of this work
offered no cover in exposed passages
and, as various parts emerged briefly
from the ensemble, the assurance and
control of each voice was as impressive
as the fine, tight sound which they made
as a whole throughout the recital.
1685 was a good year for composers.
Bach the Father, Handel, and Domenico
Scarlatti were all born during that
twelvemonth and Dorothy White used
this peculiarity of Baroque history as a
convenient framework for a recital of
their harpsichord music. While fre-
quently in evidence as a plodding con-
tinuo, the harpsichord is rarely heard
in its distinguished role of a solo in-
strument. Miss White has been its tire-
less champion for some time now and
this recital, in its interest and quality,
was the deserved winner of more con-
verts to the most graceful voice of
the keyboard family.
The Scarlatti sonatas were particu-
larly enjoyable. Performed with a keen
awareness of their often novel and
humorous effects, these short works
would make an attractive program by
themselves. Technically excellent and
above all tastefully presented, this
Evening with the Masters was a simple,
relaxing delight.
Art
Contemplation
By ELWYN LYNN
Michael Taylor. Watters Gallery, Syd-
ney.
Rolin Schlicht. Central Street Gallery,
Sydney.
Gaudier-Brezeska. Rudy Komon, Syd-
ney.
ONE ADVANTAGE of living away
from the mainstream, even if it is
sometimes on a distributary, is that one
doesn’t have to follow the fashion that
hails a Schlicht or depreciates a Michael
Taylor. More than fashion is involved,
however; Alan Bowness of the Court-
auld Institute, in his contribution to the
fine collection of excitingly illustrated
essays in The Art of Our Time, ad-
vances the notion of the historical
validity of styles, a notion that asserts,
for example, the inadequacy of lacer-
ated, post-war symbolism and art as
'‘anxious object” and welcomes the
urbane art of the “sane” and affluent
’sixties.
Not only hasn’t art this simple causal
relation with its environment, but the
anxious art of action painting, despite
de Kooning, Pollock, and Franz Kline,
was not so violent that it had to be
replaced by an art of bland color and
minimal forms; what could be more
beguilingly lyrical than a Rothko,
Gustow, or Frankenthaler? Except for
the earlier works of Hodgkinson, Gleg-
horn, and Rapotec (whose vigor is be-
coming theatrical), local action paint-
ing was generally more linear, prob-
ing, and shadowily romantic than mas-
sive and flamboyantly volcanic.
Taylor explores an area between tur-
bulence and cool contemplation; his
oils, with their pale grey and bleached
fluidity, recall Pollock of The Deep with
the void that suddenly shows through
the swarming lush surface, but he is
more the Eastern artist than the meta-
physical Westerner, for the maelstroms
of paint, the large liquescent forms, and
the desperate-looking gestures are modi-
fied by that air of contemplation asso-
ciated with the most “spontaneous”
oriental brush stroke. In the splendid
Kite he still a vast area of shifting
white with a triangle of red dots right
out of cubism’s analytic approach to
form; two black concentric circles, just
off-centre, give a focal point to Ocean
Front, where swirling mists of soft grey
waters sweep over hidden color.
There is, in some oriental painting
and in Turner, a moment when the
dissolution and becoming of forms, de-
spite their liquescence and impalp-
ability, are stilled; in a work like Venus
Creek, that resembles an industrially
smoked Turner, with its trailing ges-
tures and vaporous shapes, the flux is
momentarily arrested as though the
forces themselves had decided to pause.
Elsewhere he imposes as in This
Way to the Mountains some black
Kline-like signals on the directionless
areas, but he is most satisfying when
most fluid; his one glance at hard-edge,
With a Natural Curl, certainly does not
look natural to him.
On unpainted or uniformly stained
duck, Schlicht tosses or assembles two
main, artificial shapes: elongated rect-
angles with rounded ends and squarer
ones with one' edge scalloped. From
such simple shapes he produces some
lively works where the parallel between
the tug and thrust of form and color
has no equal in local color-field paint-
ing. At times, as in Hansa, where
bright bars tossed on light yellow seem
about to form the arc of a star or cog
wheel, the shapes seem to both disperse
and assemble. Though both might be
aghast at the thought, Taylor and
Schlicht often share a similar attitude
to the impermanence and transitoriness
of forms.
They share, too, a fondness for levi-
tated shapes; only in Florin Time has

Schlicht any of the expansive pressures
of hard-edge. The blue area in the top
left presses against the yellow oblongs
that fence it from the green. One
yellow rod is invading the green, and
some others that have done so turn
mauve with delight. While such works
are concerned with unpredictable levi-
tation, those that use the scalloped rect-
angles attempt to arrest the flow of vast
surfaces: the dusty yellow, diamond-
shaped Clooth is made swing by scal-
loped shapes near three of its corners; in
Effendi the scalloped oblongs are im-
pacted in a dull green, crimson, and
blue inverted L-shape not only to set
up fugitive after-images but to let the
bottom left corner float away momen-
tarily into nothingness. Part of their
delight is the eclat with which they
reveal their secrets more than first
look reveals, for less really can be more.
The catalogue at Komon’s show of
five small sculptures and 30 drawings
by Gaudier-Brezeska (he died on the
Western Front in 1915) has some of his
words that could easily fit the vocabu-
lary of color-field artists: “Sculptural
feeling is the appreciation of masses in
relation. Sculptural ability is the defin-
ing of the masses by planes,” but these
drawings, which often lasso space with
economy and grace, owe little to sculp-
tural modes and one can easily see how
he needed the swelling, tightly packed
forms of sculpture to rescue him from
indecision and flaccidity. What is solid
and concrete in his sculpture is only
obliquely and beautifully suggested in
some of the soft pencil drawings. As
with Schlicht, it is the lively economy
that impresses, but when one thinks of
Taylor or Pollock one recalls that car-
toonists and designers are also masters
of economy.
Films
Greatness
By BEVERLEY TIVEY
The Pawnbroker. Director, Sidney
Lumet.
Othello. Director, Stuart Burge.
A SECOND VIEWING of “The
Pawnbroker,” screened during last year’s
Sydney Film Festival, confirms the
original impression that here is one of
the most memorable and moving films
I’ve seen.
Sidney Lumet made his mark with
his first essay into film-making,
“Twelve Angry Men”; in the succeed-
ing ten years he has grown and de-
veloped as a director, until now he has
made a picture which can join the dis-
tinguished list of the great ones.
Based on a novel by Edward Lewis
Wallant, it is the story of the manager
of a seedy New York pawnshop, sur-
vivor of a Nazi concentration camp.
Unable to bear the memory of the
deaths of his family and friends, denied
the solace of death, he has wrapped
himself in a cold, protective indifference
to life and humanity, caring nothing
for others and deliberately blinding
himself that the failing shop is only
a cover for its proprietor’s more profit-
able, less legally acceptable, activities.
But in the few days covered by the
story his stony armor has started to
crack; old memories force their way
into his brain and he is finally forced
back to a realisation of life and feeling,
knowing bitterly what harm he has done
or condoned by his apathy.
Quite apart from its assault on the
emotions, the film is fascinating to
watch from a technical viewpoint
especially in its fresh treatment of the
tired old flashback device, with some
of the shots flickering past almost too
quickly for identification as the man
desperately tries to reject the memory
of the past; and there is lyrical beauty
in the dreamy shots of the family picnic
which marks the man’s last happy day
—indeed, his last day of life in the
proper sense.
Rod Steiger’s performance as the
man trying desperately to cling to the
safety of indifference is surely one of
the great ones of the cinema; and in a
highly satisfactory supporting cast it is
interesting to see Brock Peters as his
procurer-boss playing a thoroughly
nasty character —as a rule a sort of in-
verted race prejudice condemns Negro
actors to playing Mister Nice Guy.
“Othello” doesn’t pretend to be any-
thing but a filmed record of the
National Theatre stage production; cer-
tainly the set is bigger than most
stages, but it is still the old pillars-
and-sky background that does duty for
most Shakespearean productions in the
theatre; the camera work is deliberately
unobtrusive and not a little dull.
Olivier’s performance, too, is a stage
performance, mannered, bigger than
life, with all his considerable battery
of actor’s tricks mercilessly exposed by
the camera’s cold eye. It’s an interest-
ing study in technique, but never to me
a moving or convincing presentation of
a noble character.
Other players seem to me to come
across far more successfully; Frank
Finlay makes a magnificent insolent
lago, his appearance of bluff respectful-
ness barely covering his arrogance and
spite; and Maggie Smith manages to
present Desdemona as innocent and
trusting without being the simp the
character usually appears.
One of the difficulties of this play,
and one which I’ve never seen an actor
sucessfully overcome, is the suddenness
with which Othello falls for lago’s lying
hints. Olivier meets the problem by
starting to bellow, but though Olivier
in full cry is a pretty impressive sight,
it really doesn’t go far toward explain-
ing motivation.

shipping and is on the way in our overseas trade. The
technical as well as the labor problems involved in the
transition are immense, but, going on last week’s spate of
information on the subject, ways are being cut through
them. Shipping industry employers, organised labor, and
government have all shown themselves earnestly bent to this
purpose. If it is achieved, the miracle of mending the
Achilles’ heel of the Australian economy will have been
performed. Up to now the competitive position of our
exports and the landed cost of our imports have been
at the mercy not only of intractably high handling charges
to, from, and at Australian ports, hut also of overseas-owned
shipping companies virtually holding our economic viability
in the world context in their hands.
The logical extension of the miracle of reducing our
shipping costs to a bare minimum is to get as much as
possible of the carriage of our international trade in our
own hands. The establishment of an Australian overseas
shipping line is something THE BULLETIN has been
pushing as hard as anybody the past few years. Yet there
is by no means plain sailing and it is as well to be realistic
about it. We will have to take some drastic steps to stream-
line the costs of running Australian ships to a degree which
Alex Hunter told the shipping conference in Melbourne
last week places them “as nearly as possible on a viable
commercial footing.”
Canvassing some of these Hunter thoughts, the most
important was “to cease or specifically delimit the opera-
tion of protection policies for the shipbuilding industry.”
Another was to make the financial and fiscal climate for
shipowners more encouraging along the well-established lines
of the traditional and successful shipping countries. A third
major step, but a much more contentious one, would be to
relax the present condition that Australian registered ships
must be manned entirely by Australian crews on Australian
award rates. If this is too much to ask, Hunter suggests
Australian shipowners “could be quietly encouraged to by-
pass the requirements of Australian registration.”
In Hunter’s view these revisions of policy would give us
every chance of getting “a small, moderately successful,
subsidy - free overseas merchant marine employing the
appropriate type ship on certain routes,” say, starting with
ore and coal carriers on the triangular route N.S.W.-Japan-
N.W. Australia and perhaps branching out into the

MEN AND MATTERS
WHEN THE FAMOUS Achilles Club
was formed in London in the early
’twenties, it took its colors from those
on the hat of a Mrs. Anderson, the
wife of one of its founders. When
Scotsman William Ramsay was won-
dering what to call the family boot-
polish enterprise he founded in Mel-
bourne sixty years ago (which now
as a massive, world-wide business is to
be floated as a slom. public com-
pany), he, too, looked to his wife,
Annie, who was born in New Zealand,
and called it Kiwi—a name destined
to rub off to shining financial effect
on the family’s fortunes.
Annie outlived her William by many
years to become an even rarer species.
She was chairman of the concern from
1924 to 1933, aided by her two sons,
another William and Thomas, the pre-
sent chairman, who as a B.Sc. came
into the firm from Scotch College and
Melbourne University in the 19205.
Mr. Thomas Ramsay, now on the
verge of 60, who has been managing-
director for the past ten years, took
over the chair from his brother John,
who died last year; it is the latter’s
son J.W. who is now assistant managing
director. So the family, which will
still hold four-fifths of the shares after
the float, seems well secured also in the
management succession.
Mr. Thomas Ramsay has more
fingers in board, trade association, ad-
visory, and pro-
motion pies than
a dozen Jack
Horners. Early in
World War II he
was a lieutenant
in the AIF before
becoming assistant
controller of
munitions, 1941-
45. In 1965 he got
the CMG to mark
his public services.
He is a familiar
figure in clubland
and sporting (particularly tennis, golf,
and racing) circles in his native Mel-
bourne (born in the Bomber’s suburb)
and wider afield. More intriguing than
that, perhaps, is his deep interest in
historical research. For the past six
years Mr. Ramsay has been president
of the Royal Historical Society of Vic-
toria.
ONE OF THE TOUGHEST assign-
ments Western Australia could turn up
has been handed to 44-year-old John
Knox, who on June 19 takes on the
new post of Director-General of Trans-
port. He will head an eight-man
Transport Authority, co-ordinating all
forms of transport in a situation ripe
for a radical shake-out.
A chartered engineer, he was the
T. M. Ramsay
John Knox
youngest captain in the 2nd AIF be-
fore becoming Shell’s W.A. manager.
Working the North-West he came to
know the country intimately and was
among the first handful to appreciate
fully the possibilities of what was still
regarded as the Cinderella State. In
its widely quoted reference to the West
as the potential Ruhr of South-East
Asia, “The Times” of London was quot-
ing John Knox, a man of tremendous
energy and vision who resisted pro-
motion when it meant leaving the
State.
When he is criticised —as he cer-
tainly will be in such a job—it will not
be for failing to look far enough ahead.
Despite its formidable challenges, the
post carries its rewards—sl4,ooo a year,
$4500 more than the Transport Minister
to whom he will be responsible.


Scandia type and container ships as now employed on the
UK-Japan runs.
If the coast looks a little blurred to Hunter, for much
the same reasons it also does to Adrian Boehme, assistant
general manager of Associated Steamships, whose integrated
plans with overseas containers, envisaging nine container
ships to be plying between Australia and Britain, were
announced during the week. But Boehme believes the com-
parative chances of Autralia succeeding in overseas shipping
have greatly improved with the advent of containerisation
and unit loads, because we are now a world leader in ship
operating and management expertise in these fields.
Up the Brits
ON MORE THAN ONE occasion British diplomats have
reproached us for unfair criticism of the Old Country and
its ways. So let us take this opportunity to offer congratula-
tions on the success of Britain’s econemic stabilisation policy,
as very fairly reported in the Budget Speech this week.
The success was unexpected, not easily achieved, and strik-
ingly impressive in the final outcome. Exports were raised
14 percent in two years, and the trade balance solidly
righted. The incomes policy freeze worked almost fully,
costs being kept constant. The freeze, while helping the
balance of payments, did not raise unemployment to nearly
the extent expected.
It is, of course, true that successful stabilisation is only
the start. The British now have to get on with the job of
modernisation. But at least they have gone through the
painful prerequisites.
Uranium in confusion
THE DEPARTMENT of National Development is most
noted for its inaction. But its action is often also disquieting.
The latest strange scheme to come out of the Department
is a complex export embargo on uranium. It provides, first,
that existing reserves may not be exported and, second,
that except for particularly large new discoveries no more
than fifty percent of the find may be sold abroad.
The Minister for National Development is rather charac-
teristically confused. He says he hopes that it will prove
an incentive to the search for uranium, though he does not
explain his basis for this hope. Why on earth should a series
of restrictions on exports stimulate search? There is no real
domestic market for the metal at present, and there won’t
be until we have nuclear power stations. Mr. Fairbaim says
that his policy is based on a belief that Australia has
insufficient reserves to support even a modest nuclear power
program. The obvious reaction to this is to ask when this
“modest program” of which he speaks will be started. There
are not even any plans yet, so why should the searchers risk
their money? And is it not likely that the logic of the
present restrictions will lead to further attempts to keep
reserves by expanding their scope?
There is no incentive whatever to search, though Mr.
W. C. Wentworth has suggested a means by which one
could be provided within the existing scheme. The Federal
Government could offer to buy at world prices all the
uranium which is found. Such stockpiling would not be
costly since, as the Minister said in the House, “The price
will undoubtedly go up.” When Mr. Wentworth put his
scheme to Fairbairn his pathetic reply was that the price
“might not go up.”
There are several courses open to the Government: (a)
Laissez-faire, by which export prospects will induce private
investors to sink money in search, and thereby unearth new
deposits; (b) the Wentworth scheme; (c) search by Govern-
ment. There are sound arguments for each of these, but
none for Mr. Fairbairn’s worst of all worlds.
THE WEEK BRIEFLY
For the economy: As at September 30 last year,
Australia’s population totalled 11,586,750; over the
September quarter, the birthrate (births per 1000) drop-
ped from 20.13 (September quarter, 1965) to 19.47.
To a great chorus of discordant voices, the Federal
Government put a partial embargo on uranium exports,
ostensibly “to ensure that sufficient uranium would be
available for essential needs.”
The Federal Treasurer admitted that the Bankers’
Development Refinance Corporation might attract funds
which could otherwise finance consumer spending.
For the markets: Despite BHP’s significant
vagaries, most industrial sections on Australian share
markets look tolerably firm on good volumes; the over-
all index has gained. Among miners, uranium issues
showed disturbance.
Industrials are very quietly traded in London; bonds
and fixed-interests go ahead on the interest-rate picture
. . . What analysts are calling a “delayed action” sent
Wall Street ahead at the week’s end.

Mount Newman’s iron ore was signed with the Western
Australian Government on Monday, April 10.

Morgan’s copper and gold output well up . . . Mount
Isa’s copper production is still below last year’s levels

over-subscribed . . . International Nickel, of Canada,

Economic sunshine
Trumps from the Treasurer
BY CROESUS
LAST YEAR’S economic weather
wasn’t much to Mr. McMahon’s liking,
or anybody else’s for that matter, and
the Treasurer in his first year of office
remained rather more in his shell than
he probably preferred. His public peeps
at our economic prospects were rare.
Now, whether it is because the PM has
been overseas or because the economic
showers have stopped and the sun is
shining, we’ve been hearing a lot more
from him. He has been all smiles, too,
and these get broader with each appear-
ance. What’s more, be it in Melbourne
talking to the Press or in Canberra
dining with hire-purchase people, he has
soothing words for everybody.
Reflecting the glow of the economic
recovery when talking to the Press in
Melbourne, Mr. McMahon predicted
even better things to come, with a Gov-
ernment determined to maintain a high
rate of expenditure without necessarily
increasing taxation to pay for it. Even
if the increase in defence expenditure
next year would, as he surmised, be
only about half the step-up this year,
taxes wouldn’t go up if he could help
it.
His tongue may have been in his
cheek in saying this. On the other hand,
Mr. McMahon seems quite proud of
the deficit he budgeted for this year,
citing it as the answer to a taunt that
the Government had let stagnation in
the economy prevail too long and
lacked the adventuresome spirit. Of
course it is one thing to budget for a
deficit as some Australian Treasurers
have found in the past and another to
realise one, at least of the comtemplated
dimension, and this may well be the
case this year. At least on present indi-
cations it is not unlikely that, given the
spate of loan money flowing into the
Treasury and the better trend in tax
receipts, what used to be called the
cash deficit will turn out to be much
smaller than Mr. McMahon expected it
to be last August.
For all that, Mr. McMahon is stamp-
ing himself as a go-go Treasurer and
this is a refreshing change, provided he
leaves himself a well-defended line of
retreat should the pulling out of all the
stops drive the economy too far too fast.
You can see the new spirit in his
approach to the States’ needs for
finance. On his Melbourne showing, the
door is now wide open for the Premiers
to walk in with proposals to test the
new liberality. Apparently, for a
Premier to return home from Canberra
shouting “victory” will be in extremely
bad taste in future.
I don’t know where this new philo-
sophy is going to land us unless it is
into tightrope situations, but talking
of more immediate matters I’m not
sure if it is prudent for a Treasurer to
talk as supinely about the balance of
payments’ outlook as the Treasurer did
in Melbourne. I have a sneaking feeling
also that Treasury officials might agree
with me, because it is known that they
are really a bit worried on this score.
To underline the doubts, on the morrow
of Mr. McMahon’s Press interview we
learned that overseas funds had dropped
another $ 14.6 m. in the latest week.
There are in fact big question marks
over all three main items in the balance
of payments. Over trade items, for in-
stance, there is a big one over the price
of wool, which the Treasurer removed
in one stroke by predicting the price
would rise now that interest rates in
some of the big wool-consuming coun-
tries are coming down. All one can say
on this is that we’ll have to wait and
see. A rise cannot be written into ex-
port receipts until it happens. We can-
not just take McMahon’s word for it.
There’s another over imports. Imports
have already been moving up in re-
flection of the general lift in industrial
and business activity in the past few
months, though the March quarter’s
rise of 5 percent in itself is not of an
order to get excited about. The
Treasurer had nothing to say on what
portends in this direction, though it is
a reasonable assumption that if the rise
in domestic activity gathers pace the
imports bill will increase to match it,
not counting any step-up in payments
for overseas defence equipment. At this
stage imports are running at well below
those in August and September last;
indeed the March bill of $256.8m. was
well below the previous March’s
$270.1m., which was particularly high.
But we don’t know what defence equip-
ment payments lie ahead. Nor do we
know what’s in the private imports
pipeline, except that it must be pretty
full if importers have been following
the general economic portents.
The third question mark over the
balance of payments would be about
capital inflow. On this Mr. McMahon
was quite precise, acknowledging it had
fallen and that this year we would
get around s2oom. less than last year;
he didn’t hazard a guess as whether
the downward trend was continuing or
what the prospects were for next year.
Apart from the latter consideration, the
Treasurer’s neat round figure for the
fall from last year is difficult to inter-
pret. Overall, last year, net identified
capital inflow amounted to $475m. This
includes all sources except portfolio in-
vestment, the amount of which was not
available when the figure was struck. I
would say that a fall of s2oom. from
$475m. was at least very significant in

the balance of payments equation. How-
ever, Mr. McMahon simply said it was
not depressing. Take your pick.
Perhaps it would have sounded less
depressing if the Treasurer had
explained that the Government has been
repatriating some overseas loans this
year and that in the first six months
of the year these cost overseas reserves
sB7m., whereas in the full previous year
the outflow of capital on this score was
only s23m. If these amounts are de-
ducted, the figures for total identified
capital inflow the Treasurer predicts for
this year and that realised last come
very much closer together.
From the viewpoint of overseas
reserves (which fell only s2lm. last
year but dropped sl2Bm. in the first
half of this one and have continued to
decline since despite a striking reduction
in the current account deficit), this
doesn’t make this year’s situation look
any better. But it does mean that direct
private capital inflow from abroad won’t
have fallen by anything like $200m.,
perhaps only sloom., or even less com-
pared with the $426m. gained in the
previous year. The Treasurer would
not be thanked for saying all that on a
TV program. He has an unenviable task
explaining a complicated question off
the cuff in general terms, anyway.
He also ran into this sort of difficulty
in Melbourne when queried on the pos-
sible effects on the availability of capital
in competitive uses for such funds as
may be diverted via the Bankers’ De-
velopment Refinance Corporation. His
experience was a useful warm-up for
what he had to say on the subject in
the House and also at the hire-purchase
people’s dinner table in Canberra. I’ve
been a bit surprised that, in all the
discussion on the possibility that the
hire-purchase companies may be
squeezed a bit by the channelling of
more local funds into development pro-
jects, the rate of interest hasn’t been
mentioned. Admittedly the banks and
institutions are in the position to direct
available funds through the new cor-
poration, but the finance companies, as
they have succeeded in doing through
thick and thin, will soon bid up their
demand price for funds if they find
themselves getting squeezed.
The chairman of lAC didn’t put it
in these terms when he said later in
the week that the finance companies
would not be much affected, but surely
this is what he meant. Apart from that,
Mr. McMahon makes a good point, as
he looks at the economic revival and
instances the eight percent rise in GNP
in the latest December quarter, that the
supply of locally generated capital will
surely expand and out of the fatter
supplies it will be easier to avoid star-
vation of some so called “less essential”
(whatever that means) uses compared
with a situation where the level of sup-
plies is static.

Cleveland Cliffs dons its Robe
MINING • SHARE • LIST • BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS
MARKET POINTERS • SECURITY ANALYSIS • COMMODITIES
By JASON in Sydney
THERE WILL SOON be another
multi-million dollar iron ore company
floating part of itself off to the Aus-
tralian public. And the prospects are
that it will also be a good one for the
stags, particularly those in Western
Australia, where the project will most
likely place a large part of its equity
capital. The tumult and the shouting
over Mt. Newman has tended to drown
out the realities of the impressive
Cleveland Cliffs consortium plans for
the Robe River iron ore project to-
ward the other end of the Hamersley
Range.
Cliffs now has a 51 percent equity
in the project, and Mitsui (also a 1\
percent partner in Mt. Newman) is
keeping its 35 percent. There seems a
fair chance that the 1\ percent interest
held by 34-year-old former Empire
Games swimmer Garrick Agnew (who
prospected the area and brought in the
other groups) could be joined with the
percent at present earmarked for
the Australian public to form a 14 per-
cent holding company. Much of this
company’s capital could then be issued
to the public. This would give Aus-
tralian investors only the second
opportunity (Hamersley was the first)
of directly participating in an iron ore
development and being told clearly
what they could expect to make out of
their investment. Shareholders of com-
panies participating in the other major
developments like Mt. Newman can
only guess at their likely rewards.
Any doubts that leading members of
the Mt. Newman consortium expressed
“off the record” at last week’s official
signing ceremony of Cliffs’ ability to
get off the ground were effectively
scotched by some impressive people in
Perth last week, including Mr. Shun-
suke Tanabe, the chairman of Mitsui,
who has a foot in what now appears
to be two fairly hostile camps. For
Cliffs had been a partner with BHP
for a while, and had then been dragged
temporarily into the Mt. Newman
group on BHP’s coat tails before decid-
ing that it could do better by going it
alone.
Within two or three weeks of the
big Mt. Newman group’s starting
work (and certainly by the middle of
May, when it must have its scheme
before the W.A. Government), Cliffs
Western Australian Mining Co. can be
expected to make an official take-off.
If it had not been for all the talk about
“phasing of operations,” so rivals do
not tread on each other’s toes at the
Mt. Newman opening, Cliffs would pre-
sumably have already had something to
say about their project.
Tenders are already in for the pellet
plants needed to upgrade and agglomer-
ate the limonite from the Robe River,
and doubts about profitability that
existed at the time BHP moved out to
manage Mt. Newman have been fully
dispelled with the tender figures, which
are believed to show considerably lower
costs than BHP seems to have expected.
Unlike Mt. Newman, Cliffs has had
no finance problem, although, naturally,
the whole deal has been a goer only
subject to its economics. But the money
has been tied up from the beginning
with U.S. banks, provided capital costs
could be kept within reasonable limits.
Despite its slow start and subsidiary
status, Cliffs has all the ingredients of
a copybook operation maximum
secondary treatment (at the other end
of the scale from Mr. McEwen’s
“quarry”), a high level of imported
expertise, and scope for substantial Aus-
tralian shareholding. The parent com-
pany, Cleveland Cliffs Iron Co., of
Ohio, proved its claim to top standing
by blueprinting a workable solution to
the low-grade ore’s problems when this
was not considered feasible; this was
done in a $1.5 million pilot plant at the
company’s U.S. headquarters. It also
managed to retain its 71.4 million ton
iron ore export contract at a remark-
ably high price level of 19.1 cents per
unit f.o.b. throughout the long negotia-
tions and delays.
In the reshuffling that followed Cliffs
going it alone, without BHP joint par-
ticipation in ports and haulage lines,
the throughput is likely to have been
increased, for reasons of economy, far
beyond the original 3.7 million tons
annually (worth something like $35
million a year) due to start moving
overseas in 1969, with penalty loaded
latitude to 1971.
If Cliffs decides to make Cape Lam-
bert its port (its tenders are based on
two alternative port sites), then its rail-
way line could go part of the way to-
ward serving the Lang Hancock pro-
ject that envisages a rail line down the
Fortescue Valley to link up with Wit-
tenoom’s asbestos mine, Hancock and
Wright’s iron ore desposits at Mt. Lock-
yer, and possibly even the additional
Mt. Goldsworthy deposits some miles,
further west.
THERE used to be an inviolate rule

The Chartist says:
AN extremely “bearish” situation is developing in AUSTRALIAN & KAN-
DOS CEMENT. The overall picture rather suggests a stock in a recessive
phase. It certainly has not been one for the long-term holder since 1960, but
substantial capital gains could have been made by short-term holders on the
intermediate trend which took prices from a low of 75c (after adjusting for issues)
late in 1960 to a high of $1.70 in June, 1962. The basic uptrend rate for this
period of time was approximately 60 percent appreciation per annum. The stock
has already fallen to a low of 99c this year and a short-term target of 80c at the
1960 support level is indicated; there is also an even more pessimistic downside
objective of approximately 55c. Last sale price on 15/4/67 —93 c.

buy Mt. Isa shares at levels now ruling
(about $3.75) will not be making money
in a year or so. In the past few months
the price of Mt. Isa shares has slumped
by 70 cents, largely due to the news that
production has fallen by about a quarter
so far this year and helped along by
the likelihood of further falls in the
price of copper from last year’s peak.
But buyers who paid $4.30 for the
shares earlier this year were buying for
the future, not for 1966-67.
The lower production (due to de-
velopment work in the mine connected
with the new K 57 shaft) will largely
be offset by a sharp rise in the average
price for its copper from $BOB per ton
last year to something like $950 or so
—even though the price is now falling.
So last year’s earnings per share of 18
cents are likely to fall by only a few
cents, perhaps three or four. Yet the
share price has fallen 70 cents.
The realities of this stock are that the
likely trend in the price of copper for
the next couple of years does not really
matter all that much; copper prices
could fall well below current levels
before they seriously affected Mt. Isa’s
ability to make a fortune. By the end
of this year the primary crusher will
have been installed at the bottom of the
K 57 shaft, so lifting the mine’s capacity
by almost 50 percent on last year. And
by then the mine development work
will have brought it into far richer ore
areas (its average ore grade mined in
recent years has been far below the
average of its proven reserves).
THE SOFT DRINK interim reports
have not been good. But that is no
reason to write this industry off as an
investment. To a large extent, the
poorer half-year results from Tarax
and Cohn Bros, have reflected the cool
first half of what passes for summer
in Victoria and is nothing to be dismal
about in the long run. No doubt this
rubbed off a little on Schweppes, which
announced a 14 percent rise in turnover
but no corresponding rise in profits
because of “higher costs.” But this seems
to be only half the story. In N.S.W.,
Schweppes has been subjected to some
strong competition from Shelleys in the
mixer drink section of the trade which
it dominates.
While Schweppes has launched a
strong attack on Shelleys by putting out
large-sized bottles of “family” style
soft drinks, these, on which its margins
would be lower, may account for a
large part of Schweppes’ increased turn-
over. Shelleys’ attack on Schweppes’
mixers follows the pattern of vigorous
assaults on markets by recently acquired
subsidiaries of the British Tobacco
Company, which has Shelleys in N.S.W.
and Marchants and Coca-Cola in Mel-
bourne fighting for it. But it seems that
the market is soon to settle down.
Schweppes does not appear to be suffer-
ing from the Shelleys’ mixers campaign,
and no doubt some of the expenses in-
volved in its new South-East Asian
franchised areas, which it had to meet
in the latest period, will soon begin to
pay off.
Transport turnabouts
Fleetways for takeovers
By PELIAS in Melbourne
IT SEEMS highly likely Fleetways
(Holdings) Ltd. will receive a take-
over bid later this year. In the trans-
port world the group is comparatively
small-time. This alone makes it take-
over prone in such an industry. An
added temptation for anyone with an
eye on the group is its extremely sue-
cessful record during its short history
on the public lists.
It is suggested that the bid could
come from a shipping organisation. This
fits in with recent trends, such as the
move by the P & O group into Mayne
Nickless. It also dovetails, nicely, with
the swing toward containerisation in the
shipping and transport world.
This overseas bidder is also under-
stood to be interested in several other
Australian companies. However, to
avoid causing a panic in the industry
by making takeover bids left, right, and
centre it intends to let Fleetways absorb
the chosen victims first and then acquire
the lot in one swoop by buying out
Fleetways. And to fit this pattern, Fleet-
ways has made a bid for Brisbane-based
Luya, Julius Ltd.
Further investigation into this
takeover show that the agreement
included a paragraph which said the
closer integration of Luya, Julius, and
Fleetways was in the interests of both
companies because of changes develop-
ing i n shipping practice. This could
mean anything, especially as Fleetways
uses the roll-on-roll-off Tasmanian ferry
service.
Second, the bid was immediately
accepted and recommended by Luya,
Julius directors. Company boards
always take a few days to make up
their mind unless they have been
negotiating with their absorber before-
hand. If such was the case, it lends
credence to the possibility that Fleet-
ways was informing Luya, Julius of its
part in the broad plans which an
unknown overseas shipping company
has for the Australian shipping and
transport industry.

it may well have been brought into
being by the fact that one of Fleet-
ways’ three major shareholders is U.K.-
controlled Gibbs Bright and Co. Pty.
Ltd. Perhaps the unknown U.K. bidder
has already negotiated acceptance by
this shareholder for its yet-to-be-made
bid. (A Mr. G. A. D. Bright is a
director of Fleetways.)
Fourth, another major shareholder is
the local William Crosby group—some
of its activities are connected with ship-
ping. Fifth, and finally, the other major
shareholder is a family investment com-
pany which is apparently controlled by
Fleetways’ managing director, Captain
J. P. Williams. Now Captain Williams
has what could be called extremely
strong connections with the Coastal
Shipping Commission; this controls the
Australian National Shipping Line.
Who could possibly be in a better posi-
tion to negotiate the takeover of Fleet-
ways by a shipping company?
At 76 cents, Fleetways 50-cent shares
are not historically high and may be
well worth a gamble on the strength of
the here-presented observations. Several
thousand call options have been taken
over the shares in Melbourne recently.
TAKING TIME out from Hamersley
for clients not lucky enough to par-
ticipate in this virtual handout of capi-
tal gains, Melbourne’s leading broker
has listed four cheaper stocks.
Ansett Transport is probably the
most attractive of the four, as the
shares are selling around their lowest
point for several years. At 8.6 percent
the yield is also the highest of the four.
Earning rate was 18.8 percent in 1965-
66 and pre-tax profits rose 21 percent
in the latest December half. The tele-
vision subsidiary reduced its loss (the
broker says break-even point is not ex-
pected until 1967-68). The group is
doing extremely well in the air cargo
and road transport field also, and is
reported to be increasing its share of
Melbourne-Sydney airline passengers
at the expense of TAA.
The broking house takes a solid dive
in market status for its second recom-
mendation, Elmaco Industries, manu-
facturer of plastic gadgets, parts and
electrical switches and plugs. Earning
rate fell from 24.4 to 20.6 percent last
year, apparently because of non-recur-
ring costs with the move to a new fac-
tory. This was still good cover for the
11 percent dividend and profits were
reported higher in the first half of the
current year. The new factory is appar-
ently bringing benefits and at 70 cents
the shares yield 7.9 percent from the
dividend.
International Resistance is the third
choice, at 98 cents and yielding 6.3
percent from the 12£ percent dividend,
which was not all that well covered by
earnings of 15.4 percent in 1965-66.
The output of radio and television
components has been halved to 25 per-
cent of the group’s total production

over the past few years. This diversi-
fication into new products is still going
on, but one doubts if it has much point
for shareholders: over the same few
years earning rate has also been halved!
Nevertheless, the group’s fortunes could
have reached a turning point, and while
they remain 10 cents below asset back-
ing and 40 cents below the 1966 high
price, they are probably worth a
gamble. But nothing else! Companies in
this position have a habit of getting
takeover bids now and then.
The last of the four is Olympic, that
battered veteran of the tyre industry.
The 50 cent shares are at 74 cents and
yielding 6.9 percent from the 10 per-
cent dividend, covered last year by 14.1
percent earnings on capital. The 15
percent profit increase in the first half
of the current year indicates that the
group is at last in an upswing of decent
dimensions. This is mainly because it
has smartened up its tyre-marketing
activities. It is also getting value from
the price increase last August and
increased demand from motor - car
makers. There will be a sizable interest
bill to meet this year on the 1966 un-
secured note raising, but profits should
still rise a fair degree. Nevertheless,
the stock does not inspire for capital
growth.

Sam. Allen's stake
in the north
IN THE PAST two years or so when
so many things were going badly for
North Queensland hotelier and mer-
chant Samuel Allen and Sons Ltd.,
the company still managed to do
moderately well; pre-tax profit even
edged up two percent. Now, with most
of its interests beginning to run strongly
at last, its prospects are very good
indeed. And as major developmental
projects continue in the north (particu-
larly in the Townsville area) with all
the solid drinking that goes with them,
the company’s heavy dependence on
seasonal conditions could well ease.
There is, then, a double impact of
adverse factors being overcome and
favorable ones being added, such as
the development of beef roads in
Northern Territory and Queensland for
the transport of cattle to the Townsville
meatworks and harbor outlet, the
expansion at Townsville’s University
College, and the Federal Government’s
expenditure of s26m. on an army
jungle training centre there. Townsville,
the port for Mt. Isa Mines and the
site of its refinery, should benefit from
Isa’s prospective 50 percent production
rise from the K 57 shaft.
This year’s results will probably not
do anything wonderful in earning rate
terms, but directors expect at least to

When It’s shivering cold and your office becomes an
igloo, your factory little Antarctica, your
staff slows down. That’s bad. Bad for production
and bad for profits. What to do? Insulate with
SISALATION heat-reflecting aluminium
foil insulation.
Inexpensive Sisalation keeps winter out and slashes
fuel bills up to 40%. It also makes summers 15
degrees cooler. Think what the extra comfort means
in terms of improved productivity. Everyone works
better because they’re comfortable and happy.
Install fire-resistant Sisalation 450 in new or existing
buildings, in the roof and walls and it will work for
you 24 hours a day without pay. Not only will it
wsiiisisisi
reflect radiant heat, but it protects you from leaking
roofs and storm damage because it’s tough, weather-
proof. Left exposed as a ceiling surface its high
reflectivity improves light distribution.
Sisalation 450 has qualities no other foil can match.
It’s guaranteed fire-resistant for life and is double-
reinforced for optimum strength and durability.
A proven method of efficient insulation, Sisalation
450 is used extensively in factories, schools, ware-
houses, and in cold stores operating at sub-zero tem-
peratures.

maintain last year’s 14.5 percent earn-
ing rate on capital enlarged by last
July’s one-for-four par issue, despite the
difficulties Samuel Allen continued to
encounter during the first half of this
financial year. But in subsequent years
(perhaps building up to an appropriate
climax in its centenary in five years’
time) earnings should bound ahead,
provided the seasons are not too severe.
Samuel Allen claims North Queens-
land has not had a normal season for
some years. In its book, there has not
been a good heavy wet season since
1959. Nevertheless, since that year,
profits have climbed with only minor
interruption in 1966, and earning rate
has improved enough to justify suc-
cessively higher dividends, from eight
percent in 1962 to a ten percent rate
for the past two years.
Since 1965, earnings have been
adversely affected by conversion to
decimal currency (at a capital cost to
date of $45,695), the. long-standing
drought, the strike at Mt. Isa and its
aftermath, and by the depressed state of
the sugar industry (which could con-
tinue for a while yet). The recent
floods were isolated to the Ingham dis-
trict, and directors assured shareholders
in their interim report last month that
there was no loss of any consequence
to stock, plant, or fixed assets. There
could be a temporary reversal of
trading there, but Governments are
organising flood relief to mitigate
losses. Large parts of Queensland are
still dry, and Ayr, for instance, has so
far had only half its normal rain.
Queenslanders are still drinking,
through drought and flood, and hotels
are Samuel Allen’s major business. It
has 54 hotels and two hotel-motels,
almost all Queensland’s hotels north of
Capricorn, selling Cairns bottled pro-
ducts (North Australian Breweries, a
subsidiary of Carlton and United
Breweries, with a brewery in Cairns)
and Carlton and United’s Melbourne
bottle products. It also is the North
Queensland distributor for Dewars
Whisky.
Land and buildings in the 1966
accounts were up $569,000 to $5.1m.,
much of this increase apparently relat-
ing to the rebuilding of the Midtown
Hotel-Motel, formerly known as the
Carriers Arms Hotel, at Townsville.
The company has a regular program of
maintenance, but no reference is made
by directors to how much this costs the
company each year.
Motels are a competitive force in
the accommodation business, but not
in liquor. To Samuel Allen, accommo-
dation in Cairns and Townsville is an
important source of income, but pro-
bably not elsewhere.
Samuel Allen has three retail trading
outlets—Hollimans in Townsville (hard-
ware, electrical, and sporting goods),
A. E. Clayton (hardware, farm machin-
ery, and irrigation equipment) at Ayr,
and Wypers (hardware, crockery, and
electrical retailers) at Cairns. The
parent has branches in Townsville,
Cairns, Innisfail, Ingham, and Mt. Isa.
The company is agent for Philips
Electrical Industries in North Queens-
land, and has distributed for Carrier
Air Conditioning in Townsville since
October, 1964, and in Cairns since
January, 1965.
With Ford franchises in Townsville,
Ayr, and Mt. Isa, Samuel Allen is one
of the biggest Ford distributors in
Queensland. There is also a finance
subsidiary, and the company has a sub-
stantial interest in shipping in Towns-
ville and Cairns (forwarding, etc.), and
about a five percent interest in Tele-
casters North Queensland Ltd., whose
shares are currently selling near three
times par. All told, Samuel Allen
employs over 700 people and is a
trading force in the north that could
well attract the attention of bigger,
expansion-minded companies.
A one-for-four par issue to share-
holders registered in May 1966 followed
a one-for-four par issue in October
1964, which was not fully called up
until March 1965. The latest issue was
payable 25c on application July 1, and
25c on October 1, the final 50c on
December 31, 1966. The new capital
is only now being employed in projects
linked with Queensland’s development
and should begin to be reflected in
earnings in the current half-year.
Sales and profits before tax were
10 percent higher for the December
half than in the first half of 1965-66,
continued comparatively higher for
January and February and directors are
“very encouraged” by present trends.
New shares ranked for one quarter of
the interim dividend, and equally for
the final, so the dividend commitment
will be 16 percent higher for the full
year (and profits must rise by the same
proportion this financial year to main-
tain earning rate).
Since the 19505, Samuel Allen has
relied heavily on deposit money, largely
from local sources, and although this
may sound an expensive and hazardous
means of finance, it probably provides
more flexibility than debenture or mort-
gage money. The 77 percent reinvest-
ment rate for deposits is a tribute to
the company’s reputation. (It has not
been necessary to issue a prospectus
for years.)
At $1.85 the $1 shares, yielding 5.4
percent on dividends and 7.9 percent
on earnings, provide a good stake in
one of the most rewarding (if least
dramatic) sectors involved in northern
development.

SHARE YIELDS AND STATISTICS
BHP, in a manner of speaking, played cat and mouse with
the market over the whole week. Rising to a peak $7 at one
stage midweek, the shares came back to finish at $6.70 —their
closing level the previous week; to complicate matters, the
stock is ex-dividend 9J cents. In early sympathy, and before
its profit announcement, Howard Smith put on a mere four
cents to reach $2.64. News Ltd. leaped 18 cents to $1.98.
While British Tobacco was adding two cents, Rothmans slipped 1
a harsh 15 cents to $1.65. Less obtrusive, perhaps, for a change,
Western Mining, at $9.70, ended 20 cents higher.

Security analysis
A much sounder base
for Waltons
ALTHOUGH THE WALTONS name
is now very well known in three States
of Australia, it is the “youngest” of the
five retailers which are now included
in the 50 Leaders Index. Nevertheless,
the company has a long dividend
record, extending over more than 30
years, and during this period the divi-
dend rate has not been below 12£ per-
cent except for a few of the World
War II years when 10 percent was paid.
It is also quite clear that Waltons Ltd.
shares have the highest dividend yield,
although over the past seven years it
has shown the best rate of growth in
adjusted dividends per share. Equally, it
is apparent that, in terms of earnings
per share (also adjusted), Waltons has
shown negative growth over the past
seven years.
It may help if we now look at the
usual statistics:

Without knowing any of the details
of the FNCB-Waltons transaction, it
would be apparent to a sharp observer
that some change had taken place be-
tween the end of 1964/5 and the end
of 1965/6 for the following reasons:
1. Tax as a percentage of pre-tax
profit has declined from 41.2 to 31.9
percent.
2. The current ratio has declined
from 3.5 to 2.6 percent.
3. The proprietorship ratio (the ratio
which discloses the shareholders’ per-
centage interest in the company) has
risen sharply from 31 to 58 percent.
There can be little doubt that the
arrangement whereby Waltons sold half
of its interest in Waltons Credit Cor-
poration to the First National City
Bank has caused a significant change in
the “balance sheet” of the Waltons
Group. Perhaps one of the major
reasons for the rapid growth of Waltons
in the postwar (World War II) years
has been its ability to offer its cus-
tomers the facility of extended credit.
As a result, gross hire-purchase out-
standings had grown from just over
$4l million at July 31, 1961, to $76.6
million at July 31, 1965. In other
words, outstandings had been increasing
at the average annual compound rate
of 17 percent over the four years ended
July 31, 1965.
The association should achieve a
number of things, but the following
probably constitute the more important:
1. The First National City Bank is
one of the largest and best-known banks
in the world and its name alone will
add to the stature of the Credit Cor-
poration.
2. The Bank will also introduce new
techniques in financing which will
broaden the scope of the Credit Cor-
poration without affecting the normal
financing of Waltons’ credit sales.
3. Substantial funds have been re-
leased by the sale of the half-interest
which will be used in expanding the
retail business. (The acquisition of
Marcus Clark may well be an example.)
4. FNCB-Waltons will be able to
borrow at lower rates of interest than
the original Credit Corporation.
5. The balance sheet structure of
Waltons Ltd. has been strengthened and
will undoubtedly permit that group to
borrow on more favorable terms should
the need ever arise.
As shareholders in Waltons Ltd. will
now rely rather more on the results of
the retailing group (although they re-
tain a 50 percent interest in FNCB-
Waltons), it would be interesting to
know the trend in profitability from
retailing over the past five years. One
can derive some figures from the pub-
lished accounts and from these it seems
that the trend could have been as
under:
Year to July 31 1962 1963 1964 1965 1966
Index 1962-100 100 110 106 101 110
Frorrj this index, it seems that the
rising trend was halted in 1963 and
there was a downturn in 1964 and
1965. There seems little doubt that the
lower figures in 1965 were due in no
small measure to the launching of the
Waltons name in Victoria, in associa-
tion with the opening of the new de-
partment store in Bourke Street. The
extreme competition which was no
doubt encountered would have also had
an effect on the gross margins obtained
in Victoria and the promotional ex-
penses would have been substantial.
The fact that Waltons’ business has
been based on credit with door-to-door
collectors probably means that it will
take some time before volume can be
built up in Victoria to the highly
profitable levels of New South Wales
and Queensland, but there is no reason
to believe that these levels will not be
achieved in due course.
The growth of the overall business
cannot be achieved by door-to-door
collectors, for generally the actual sale
has to be made in a store. The acquisi-
tion of Marcus Clark will add a number
of quite worthwhile stores to the Wal-
tons chain and there is every prospect
that the Marcus Clark stores, which
are situated in areas where Waltons
are already well represented, will be
brought to a profit-earning stage quite
rapidly.
However, it would be wrong to ex-
pect some dramatic results from this
new acquisition in the current financial
year, but it is quite likely that, as a re-
sult of the tax losses that were acquired,
Waltons’ disclosed after-tax profit could
rise quite sharply this year. The bene-
fits of tax losses will certainly continue
into 1967/8 and possibly longer.
Waltons’ growth over the past ten
years has been quite dramatic. Em-
ployees have increased in numbers from
1154 to 4776 more than fourfold;
retail space has increased by 286 per-
cent from 344,999 square feet to
1,323,677 square feet, and the number
of stores has increased from 19 to 61.
Paid ordinary capital (including con-
vertible notes) has increased by almost
exactly the same percentage as retail
space.
So far as the retail space is con-
cerned, the figure for net profit before
tax and depreciation per square foot of
retail space seems to have declined
from $4.33 in 1956 to $2.82 in 1966;
it must be pointed out that the latter
figure does not include any profit from
the Credit Corporation. In 1956, the
Credit Corporation did hot exist,
although it is likely that the business
of instalment credit was being carried
on within the Waltons group. If the
profits of the Credit Corporation are
included in respect of 1966, the figure
would rise from $2.82 to $3.90.
Probably these figures can only be
of real use if one could make a com-
parison with other retail establishments.
They do, however, suggest that retail-
ing has become less profitable in relation
to the assets used and one could well
believe that this is due to lower gross
margins on average and to higher costs,
particularly labor costs.
Nevertheless, sales and profits of any
retailing operation should increase with
floor space although something more
than floor space is needed to make sales.
The Marcus Clark stores will add about
300,000 square feet of floor space to the
Waltons chain, but most of these stores
will be outside the Sydney metropolitan
area. Even so, one could expect that
in time they will add about $750,000
to net profit before tax and depreciation.
This suggests that per share earnings
could be increased from 6.7 cents to
9.4 cents without any increase in divi-
dends from FNCB-Waltons.
There have been many aspects of the
Waltons operation which seem to have
puzzled investors in recent years. To-
day, prospects look sounder than they
have done for some time.

SPECULATOR’S
DIARY
Local history:
150 years
on the Wales
I’VE ALWAYS BEEN interested in
local history, so I’ve enjoyed the flood
of stories that have recently been cir-
culating about the fledgeling Bank of
New South Wales. Like all our present-
day giants, it is hard to think of it as
ever being an infant. Who could
imagine the Wales with a staff of two
clerks and a strong box to hold its
worldly possessions?
All the horn blowing is, of course,
part of the celebrations of the Bank’s
150th birthday. Shareholders took part
in the festivities by being given a 4 per-
cent bonus dividend and the happy news
that a good year is in store. The best
present of all, however, was the one the
bank gave itself —a spanking brand-
new head office in Martin Place. The
shareholders’ present cost $2.1 million,
the bank’s will cost $14 million. Happy
birthday to me!
Actually all banks look like being in
for a vintage year. The Reserve’s de-
cision to make money more freely avail-
able is now starting to have effect.
Bank managers have never had it so
good. Advances outstanding- as at Feb-
ruary were up 10 percent on last year.
Lending commitments in the February
quarter were over 30 percent higher
than in 1966. These figures, along with
the banks’ new power to give personal
loans at a rate of 6 percent flat, all
point to a bumper crop of finals. Un-
fortunately bank shares move a little too
slowly for me, so I’ll have to miss out„
While on the subject of money, a
stock I have been watching lately is
Deposit & Investment. This is the
country’s oldest finance company and
until 1965 it could boast of not having
missed a dividend for 75 years. Nearly
80,000 of its shares changed hands on
the Sydney Exchange over the past two
weeks. Not bad trading for a stock sell-
ing almost 30 percent below par. Hop-
ing its bad debts are now a thing of
the past, also encouraged by its profits
in 1965/66 and in the first half of this
year, I decided to jump on to the band-
wagon.
Although I haven’t been tenpin bowl-
ing for some time, I’m sure the alleys
can’t be so empty as to make Bowling
Centres shares worth a mere 8 cents.
The asset backing alone, even though
it is only bowling machines, is 52 cents
per share. It’s not even as if the com-
pany is running at a loss. Last year it
made 2.8 percent on capital. Not very
good, but not as bad as 8 cents! I do
hope the market will eventually agree
with me.
Well, the mining sector is still hog-
ging the limelight and breaking the
records. Mount Newman has now be-
come our biggest-yet mining venture
and Western Mining has hit a new high
in low dividend yields. The other day,
when selling at $9.60, it crashed its
dividend yield down to a minute 0.79
percent. On this basis, at the current
dividend rate, an investor would have
to wait around 64 years to get his in-
vestment back.
Unimpressed by the record breaking,
I decided to sell two mining stocks this
week. King Island Scheelite made me
very nervous when it dropped to $2.50,
so I was pleased to get out when it
bounced back to $2.80. Mount Morgan
proved a better investment. It helped
me halve my loss on King Island Schee-
lite.
Transactions for the week were:
BOUGHT
10,000 Bowling Centres $0.08 $816
500 Deposit & Investment $0.37 $189
SOLD
200 Mount Morgan $2.82 $553
400 King Island Scheelite $2.80 $1098
The account is in credit again to the
extent of $359.

We thought designers had dis-
covered all the uses for Lysaght
Ornamesh. We’ve seen it used
in solar screens, room dividers,
car sun visors, TV grilles, safety
guards, furniture, air cleaners,
grasscatchers, ironing boards
and 1,000 other ways. But we’re
glad to say we were wrong. The
planners of the new toll section
of the Pacific Highway dis-
covered a most imaginative use
for Ornamesh—as anti-dazzle
screens. Why Ornamesh? Be-
cause only Ornamesh has the
combination of qualities needed.
It’s steel-strong. Rigid. Light-
weight. Most important, its
angled strands cut out headlight
glare without eliminating visi-
bility. Chances are, there’s a
profitable use for Ornamesh in
your activities. Call us in—we'd

MARLEY
TO THE
RESCUE..
Modern industry must have water to survive. Millions
of gallons of it. An endless flow of pure fresh water,
every hour, every day. But surely all this water must
run out sometime? That's where Marley comes to the
rescue. Marley Cooling Towers throughout Australia
are saving water for industry. Water that can be
re-used ove.r and over again. In fact the figure is a
staggering 2.5 million gallons saved per minute. That's
a lot of water. And that's one more reason you should
look to Email-Marley for your next cooling tower.

Mining
Some foreign companies
among the miners
THE ESTABLISHMENT of the
Bankers’ Development Refinance Cor-
poration is to be welcomed as a posi-
tive step toward increasing the local
participation in large mineral develop-
mental projects. In his announcement
giving preliminary details of the Cor-
poration, the Commonwealth Treasurer,
Mr. William McMahon, alluded once
again to the pervasive influence in the
Australian developmental (i.e., extrac-
tive) industries of overseas capital, both
by way of loan funds as well as equity.
Indeed it is increasingly commonplace
that the exploration and/or develop-
ment of new mineral deposits are under-
taken by an overseas company and the
wholly domestic developments such as
Western Mining Corporation’s tiickel
mine and Peko Wallsend’s new Ivan-
hoe mine appear to be of diminishing
occurrence.
Who are these foreign companies?
The usual information is along the lines
given by Longreach Oil Ltd. recently
—that “The French company, Pechiney,
will undertake the further exploration
and development of areas . . . where
promising prospects for copper and
other minerals have been found.”
Pechiney, as its full name implies, is
a French company (Compagnie de Pro-
duits Chimiques et Electrometallur-
giques) and was originally formed in
1855. Its main mining interest is in
aluminium, although it also produces
barytes, lignite, plastics, and nuclear
products. Most of the company’s mining
operations are carried out in France
and the French colonies of Senegal and
Madagascar. Its first entry on to the
Australian scene was in 1964, when it
participated in the formation of Queens-
land Alumina Ltd., taking up 20 per-
cent of the capital, together with Kaiser
Aluminium Australia Ltd., Aluminium
Limited (of Canada), and Conzinc Rio-
tinto of Australia Ltd.
Pechiney has a capital of Frs. 430 m.,
which at current rates of exchange is
equivalent of $A7Bm., while earnings
in 1964 were the equivalent of sB.9m.
Like many old established mining com-
panies, Pechiney has built up a very
large investment portfolio, which at
December 31, 1964, amounted to
$Al46m., while it also included
amongst its assets at that date $A3l.5m.
in the form of loans and advances. Its
Fr.so shares are currently selling
around Fr. 191 (equals $A3.50) to give
a yield of 2.8 percent.
Another company undertaking pros-
pecting work in Australia jointly with
Australian companies, as well as having
its own mineral leases, is International
Nickel Co. of Canada Ltd. Inco is in-
vestigating desposits of nickel jointly
with BHP on leases held by the latter
company near Rockhampton, and is
undertaking a feasibility study into the
development of large but low grade
nickel deposits in the Blacks.tone Ranges
in central Australia in conjunction with
Nickel Mines of Australia Ltd., an un-
listed local company (in which Gold
and Mineral Exploration N.L., a local
company listed in Adelaide, has a siz-
able interest). Some idea of Inco’s
stature as a miner can be gained from
its 1965 production and sales figures.
Ore mined amounted to almost 20 mil-
lion short tons and metals sold included
220,000 tons of nickel, 120,000 tons
of copper, 900 tons of cobalt, 510,0000 z.
of platinum metals and gold, and 11-
million ounces of silver. Canadian
operations are based in the Sudbury dis-
trict of Northern Ontario, and since
1965 capacity has been increased con-
siderably by the opening of new mines
both in Canada and in Guatemala,
where Inco is to establish facilities for
the mining and treatment of lateritic
ores to produce at least 11,000 tons of
nickel per annum from fairly low grade
(1.5 percent nickel) ore. In 1965, In-
co’s net profit was SU.S. 135.6 m. from
which dividends of SU.S.BIm. were
paid, while for the December, 1965,
year earnings were SU.S.I43m. The 36
million shares of no par value are sell-
ing at around SU.S.B7 to show a yield
of 3.3 percent.
Freeport Sulphur Company, men-
tioned last week in connection with
Metals Explorations, controls a large
part of sulphur and potash supplies
in the U.S.A. It does this through
the operation of four sulphur mines,
which it operates itself, and through a
half-interest in potash leases in New
Mexico and Canada. It also owns in-
terests in oil properties, and since 1963
has been producing kaolin (china clay).
In addition to its 30 percent share-
holding in Metals Exploration, Free-
port’s Australian interests include a one-
third interest in Farmout Drillers N.L.,
as well as a number of mineral leases
in which it participates with Metals
Exploration to various degrees, the
most recent agreement being its under-
taking to test a large low-grade nickel
prospect in North Queensland in return
for a 50 percent interest. Freeport’s
earnings for the December, 1965, year
amounted to $U.5.21.6m., a rise from
the 1965 figure of SU.S.9.Im. was paid.
Freeport’s shares are changing hands
in New York at around $U.5.47 to give
a yield of 2.7 percent.
A deceptively small but nevertheless
very influential company is Selection
Trust Limited, which has a 50 percent
equity in the Mount Newman iron ore
joint venture as well as an indirect
interest through American Metal
Climax, in which it has an 11.9 percent
shareholding, and is a member of the
group of companies prospecting for off-
shore minerals off the coast of Tas-
mania, of which EZ Industries is also a
member.
Although Selection Trust has a capital
of only £stg.4.lm., it would be wrong
to class it as a small investment com-
pany. Its mining activities are fairly
limited, but it holds interests, both
directly and indirectly, in African
Selection Trust, American Metal Cli-
max, Roan Selection Trust, Consoli-
dated African Selection Trust (37.7 per-
cent), and Palabora Mining Company.
Net profit for the year to March, 1966,
was £3.2m., of which £stg.l.9m. was
paid in dividends which amounted to
3/3 stg. per 5/- share. As with other
investment companies, Selection Trust
shares do not carry the benefits
of direct growth and yield 5.2 percent
at their current London price of stg.
62/-.
Commodities
Strong markets for nickel
LAST YEAR’S NICKEL deficit, the
first for a decade, will worsen this
year. Although it would most likely
be a mistake to draw short-term con-
elusions about the prospects for Aus-
tralia’s imminent production of the
metal, the present position underlines
the basic strength of nickel’s market.
Recent announcements on likely 1967
supply have brought home to con-
sumers the difficulties that lie ahead.
For four years now demand for nickel
has grown at an unprecedented rate.
The average free-world consumption in
1960, 1961, and 1962 was 500 million
lb. Last year 840 million lb. was
used—a 9 percent gain on 1965. Partly
due to loss of about 80 million lb. of
output because of a strike at Interna-
tional Nickel of Canada, production
lagged well behind usage. Not even
100 million lb. released from U.S. stock-
piles could fill the gap.
As Inco recently pointed out, there is
no shortage of nickel in the ground,
but there is an inevitable time-lag be-
tween recognition that demand has
jumped and the commissioning of new
plant. Inco spent sCanadian 73 million
last year, and plans to spend $125
million this year, on expansion,
Because of the labor dispute, Inco’s

output fell for the year. Other pro-
ducers boosted production: Le Nickel
(New Caledonia) produced 31 percent
more and Sherritt Gordon 14 percent
more. Another leading producer, Fal-
conbridge, produced 2 percent less than
in 1965.
Many of the new mines now being
developed will not be adding to supply
until late next year. Inco’s 1967 output
should not gain much, apart from
regaining the strike losses. U.S. stock-
pile releases will be down from last
year, balancing this Inco gain, while
by next year the U.S. surplus stocks will
probably have been eliminated.
So consumers are to have a hard year.
Japan, for instance, has just been in-
formed that Inco’s supplies will be
cut from 2576 tons to 350 tons this
year. This is quite a cut on a total con-
sumption around 12,000 tons.
It is therefore not surprising that the
current free-market price for nickel is
around £stg. 1400, against the £702
producer price. Free prices will most
probably go higher, but it is not likely
that the producer price will move again
after last November’s lift from £642.
Even in Japan, it was recently fore-
cast that domestic demand would be
met by production in 1967-68. Cer-
tainly nickel’s history suggests that con-
sumption will continue to rise strongly
and prices will maintain their steady
postwar climb. But it would be danger-
ous to become over-optimistic about
the basic situation on the basis of the
short-term imbalance in the market.
TUNGSTEN ORE buyers, with un-
limited fixed-price U.S. stockpile sales
providing a backstop, are staying out
of the market. Any reasonable level of
demand would soon bring the thin mar-
ket back up to the 360/- stg. ceiling
imposed by the U.S. sales. So buyers
have little to gain in buying now
assuming they are confident that U.S.
releases will not be restricted or the
selling price lifted.
On top of this, metal in nervous,
speculative Jiands has been flushed out
by the easier tone. The outlook, given
steady Chinese sales, is for prices to
return to the ceiling in the medium to
long term. It is thought that Russia,
feeling the loss of Chinese supplies, will
be buying in the West this year.
Consumption generally is expected to
lift in the second half, while the effect
of the loss by fire of a Canadian mine
plant will be felt more severely as the
supply pipeline empties. Production
elsewhere shows no sign of lifting.
But of most immediate interest is the
Canton Trade Fair this month. The
China-watchers of the tungsten market
report that supplies from that troubled
nation have borne indications of either
being drawn from stock or from mines
not normally supplying export.


BOOKS
Savonarola of the idiot box
by GEOFFREY SCOTT
The Thirties. Malcolm Muggeridge.
Collins. $4.60.
“I HAVE ALWAYS. felt myself a
stranger in a strange world ... a dis-
placed person. I have never been able
to take completely seriously, and there-
fore to believe in the validity or perm-
anence of, any form of authority . . .
An egghead came I into this world, and
an egghead shall I depart hence.” With
this cri de coeur Malcolm Muggeridge
introduces “The Thirties,” first pub-
lished early in 1940 and now re-
issued with a preface summing up the
author’s reflections nearly 30 years after.
Not that time has made much difference
to Muggeridge’s stimulating, waspish,
cranky, and idiosyncratic philosophy.
He certainly has not mellowed with
the passage of years. If anything his
targets are wider ranging and his dis-
illusionment more profound than during
the eerie, twilight days of the “phony
war.”
Malcolm Muggeridge is far better
known and enjoys an enormously larger
audience now than in prewar years.
Then, he had a modest reputation as an
essayist, critic, and editor, a gadfly wit.
The new, fashionable Muggeridge is
largely the product of television.
Millions have watched the little gnomish
figure interviewing statesmen and other
celebrities, smiling benignly, scalpel
probing delicately but remorselessly be-
neath the beautifully modulated inquir-
ing voice. They have seen him on a
pilgrimage to Lourdes, and felt their
hearts moved by the fact that this
iconoclast, this caustic denigrator of
modes and morals, is “in all humility in
search of truth which is not for yester-
day or today or tomorrow, but for all
time.” They have accompanied him on
a lecture tour of the United States,
presenting perhaps the most scarifying
and expertly slanted view of the Ameri-
can way of life that ever burst on the
TV screen. Television has raised
Muggeridge from the status of a minor
author and publicist to that of an inter-
national celebrity. His face is as
familiar as that of film stars, Popes, and
Prime Ministers. His opinions are world
news. He is, to add one more similitude
to the already interminable list, the
Savonarola of the 23-inch screen.
For its sheer entertainment value
“The Thirties” thoroughly deserved re-
publication, which is more than can be
said for most of the torrent of books
produced by the prophets of doom
before World War 11. What fun Mr.
Muggeridge has with Ramsay Mac-
donald, Baldwin, Halifax, Hoare, and
all the rest of the unctuous political
clodpates of the 19305. “Bang! bang!”
and down go the sitting ducks, one after
the other. Here lies Neville Chamber-
lain, Chamber of Commerce Quixote
and Knight of the Rolled Umbrella,
neatly impaled by a shaft of Mugger-
idgian wit. Churchill is a “stuffed lion,”
Eden the hope of all those simple souls'
who believed that the younger, ideal-
istic generation of statesmen would
“look like film actors, speak like BBC
announcers, think like Professor Gilbert
Murray.”
All the sensations, hopes, aspirations,
and disappointments of the ’thirties are
here briefly, brilliantly, and wittily dis-
sected. From his vantage post as a “dis-
placed person” Muggeridge surveys the
scene without rage or rancor always
the urbane, civilised, cynical observer,
totally unimpressed by the rise and fall
of popular idols, the sanctity of threat-
ened institutions, appeals to this or that
ideology until the whole mass of
confused and frightened humanity slides
helplessly into the inferno of war.
All the highlights of the ’thirties are
here the Peace Ballot, the Oxford
Movement, the Hunger Marches, the
Left Book Club; committed poets writ-
ing about pylons and fascism, “solemn
young men in high-necked sweaters”
making equally solemn documentary
films, and, at the other end of the
spectrum, Noel Coward’s “Cavalcade,”
with its unashamedly nostalgic evoc-
ation of happier days when Britain’s
youth were proud to be Soldiers of the
Queen, My Lads, and didn’t spout all
that seditious rot about not fighting for
King and Country.
As it transpired many of the young
men responded eagerly enough to the
appeals of La Pasionara from the bar-
ricades of beleaguered Madrid, and des-
pite the gloomy head-shakings in edi-
torial seats and club armchairs, there
was no difficulty in filling the cockpits
of the Spitfires in the years that soon
followed. Nevertheless, the ’thirties were
an age of bewilderment, divided loyal-
ties, and bumbling political leadership
that provided a rich field for the social
historian, from the ponderously earnest
to the impudently irreverent like Mal-
colm Muggeridge.
There was the Invergordon naval
mutiny to startle the public into the
realisation that the Sailors of the
King were not quite the dumb, uncom-
Malcolm Muggeridge
plaining heroes that the Soldiers of
the Queen had been. For comic relief
there was the tale of the Rector of
Stiffkey, though that ended tragically
enough when the profligate parson was
mangled to death in a lion’s cage. And
crowning all, splendidly incorporating
sex, royalty, politics, and religion, was
the grand drama of the Abdication. It
was also, Muggeridge points out, a
remarkable instance of the fickleness of
popular hero worship. The Prince of
Wales had been the Golden Boy. His
reign promised to usher in a new era
of democratic monarchy. Had he not
wept at the sight of distressed Welsh
mining villages and promised that
“something would be done”? Instead
he went off cruising with a twice-
divorced American woman. “To be
Prince Charming suited a prince; but
a King Charming would never do.
Firmly and properly had Prince Hal
put away Falstaff when he became King
Henry. Let King Edward do likewise.”
He did not, of course, and opposed
only by a handful of romantic irrecon-
cilables the well-oiled machinery of
Church and State combined to ease
King Edward VIII politely but firmly
from his throne.
Meanwhile Europe was hurrying
toward war. The League of Nations,
repository of the visions of Wilson,
Macdonald, Eden, and Blum, expired
with scarcely a sigh. (The last item
on its agenda was a proposal to unify
railway signals at level crossings.) It
had survived the rape of faraway places
like Manchuria and Abyssinia. But
when Hitler went on his rampage Col-
lective Security, the favorite delusion
of the ’thirties, vanished like smoke in
the wind. Thus, wrote Muggeridge in
his Aldershot hut in December, 1939,
“strangely, sadly, and rather foolishly
the Thirties drew to a close.”


Enemies within
By MARIA WOLKOWSKY
The Real Enemy. Pierre d’Harcourt.
Longmans. $3.85.
WHEN THE SURVIVOR of two Nazi
concentration camps writes about his
experiences, one expects to be shattered.
But there is in Pierre d’Harcourt’s
account of life in Neue Bremm and
Buchenwald something especially
strange and disturbing. One can admire
the author, who comes of a fine old
traditionally democratic French family
(whose interests include the Veuye-
Clicquot champagne industry), for
obviously having set himself the task
of reconstructing the past dispassion-
ately and without hate. However, he
seems to be bending over backwards so
far in avoiding recriminations that he
sometimes appears to have temporarily
lost his balance.
One need look no further than the
title: not “The Second Enemy” (which
would have been understandable) but
“The Real Enemy” that is, not the
Nazis, who created the concentration
camps, but the fellow-inmates whom
they forced to inhabit them. In raising
what should surely be a secondary
theme to the chief issue, he seems to
have confused the effect with the cause.
This is not to say that there is even
the remotest suspicion that he was pro-
Hitler. Indeed, he may have taken the
Nazi’s crimes as so self-evident that he
was unaware of the possibility of being
misunderstood by such paragraphs as
this: “The camp showed me that a
man’s real enemies are not ranged
against him along the borders of a
hostile country; they are often among
his own people, indeed, within his own
mind. The worst enemies are hate and
greed and cruelty. The real enemy is
within.”
After the fall of France, d’Harcourt
joined the Resistance and his hair-
raising activities with passwords, secret
documents dramatically shot across
rivers by bows and arrows, and wanted
men brazenly smuggled out in official
cars make many fictional cloak-and-
dagger tales appear slightly anaemic. A
theatrical agency in Paris was used as
a “front,” important data including
code-names and addresses of agents
were concealed in crazy masks in the
ante-room, and the professional master-
spy Major d’Autrevaux ran his bureau
with such businesslike efficiency that
he was never caught. The author
walked into a trap laid for him by a
“friend” in the Metro, made a break
for it long enough to discard evidence
that would have incriminated others,
and was badly wounded.
He is frank about his interrogations;
he tried to convince the Gestapo that
he was prepared to collaborate by giv-
ing away a good deal of information
which he knew could do no harm. This
ruse worked and he survived while two
other captured colleagues were executed.
Powerful friends were also pulling
strings behind the scenes to keep him
alive; later in Buchenwald he passed
the casual questioning or “trial” of a
top inmate, ' a Communist, who pro-
tected him often by having his name
removed from certain death assign-
ments, like the “Nacht und Nebel”
transports.
Of the deliberate cruelty of the SS
officers at Neue Bremm Reprisal Camp
he writes: “We were no more than
playthings and laughing-stocks to those
sadistic and perverted brutes. Nor had
we yet understood that it was their
policy to demoralise us by making us
look utterly ludicrous to each other; and
this was almost more important to them
than the brutality to which we were
being systematically subjected.” How-
ever, when some child inmates of
Buchenwald, aged between three years
and ten, stoned an adult prisoner to
death (he had betrayed a family to the
Gestapo) the author comments:
“Shortly after this horrible episode the
children left the camp. I was glad to
see them go. There was something
terrible about them.” The very few
Jews he met were in transit to the
worst horror-chambers, but those he
did see he remembers as' dignified in
the face of indignity and certain
ignominious death.
Perhaps Pierre d’Harcourt suffers
from a surfeit of emotional honesty:
he does no lip service to expected
conventions and he offers no excuses
for his confessed mistakes. He is, for
instance, amazingly frank about his
attitude to his religion: a comforter in
time of need, a solace in the camp,
but now more or less put by again for
a future rainy day.
His calm, flat, understated English is
excellent for his purpose; his courage,
sincerity, and desire to turn the other
cheek command respect. Perhaps it is
doing him an injustice to express the
suspicion that it is, all the same,
relatively easier to gain his charity as
his enemy than as his friend.
Proud Ireland
by DESMOND O'GRADY
Ireland Since the Rising. Timothy Pat-
rick Coogan. Pall Mall Press. $6.60.
THE TROUBLE with Ireland, of
course, is England. Ireland is too small
not to undergo English influence,- and
too proud not to react against it.
“Ireland Since the Rising” is the story
of independent Ireland, but it shows
that the wounds from the 1922-23 civil
war over acceptance of the treaty
which reserved Ulster to England did
not heal until the 19505, when the
Republic at last concentrated on its
social and economic development.
Ireland was disappointingly stagnant
in the 30 years following independence,
but Coogan shows that it was fortunate
not to be submerged altogether by in-
ternecine strife. The shadow of the »uu.
men was long on the land as is indi-
cated by a telling detail: during one of
the early changes of government, the
majority were all armed just in case
the outgoing members should be dis-
inclined to relinquish their seats.
Coogan’s is a state-of-the-nation re-
port in the perspective of the 50 years
since the 1916 rising. Deputy-editor, at
30, of the Dublin “Evening News,"
Coogan has written a broth of a book
which, with the exception of some in-
digestible lumps of information on such
matters as local government, is engross-
ing, balanced, and thorough. He is
rather tentative in his treatment of
religion, bittersweet about the failure
of the Gaelic movement, comprehen-
sive and lively on politics.
He gives a close account of Ireland’s
performance as the White Negro of the
United Nations. Its knowledge of how
perfidious Albion can be makes it sym-
pathetic to the new nations’ anti-
colonialism but its United Nations
policies have not been guided by re-
sentment nor demagogy. In the United
Nations, Ireland’s approach to finance
for peace-keeping, China, disarmament,
and Cuba has given proof of a
breadth and initiative which have too
often been lacking in home affairs.
The fresh start in Ireland, according
to Coogan, came in 1958 when more
people than ever before were repeating
“this bloody country is finished.” The
Secretary of the Finance Department,
Thomas Kenneth Whitaker, after brood-
ing over a “Dublin Opinion” cartoon
which depicted the aging Cathleen ni
Houlihan saying to a fortune teller:
“get to work, they’re saying I’ve no
future,” drafted a momentous Program
for Economic Development.
It is a far cry from Whitaker’s plan
to Eamonn De Valera, Dev, The Chief,
the symbol of Ireland, independent,
evoked by Coogan: “Eagle profiled,
appearing at meetings on a white horse,
his spare frame dressed in a flowing
black cloak, he seemed to his followers
to be Emmet, Parnell, and Pearse com-
bined in one person.” In the presi-
dential elections held since the book’s
appearance, the 84-year-old De Valera,
“the man of yesterday” defeated
Thomas O’Higgins, described in his
election posters as the “man of today
and tomorrow” but only by the narrow
margin of 10,000 votes in what seemed
to be Ireland’s last and deserved
tribute to the past.
It would not delight poets to find
Irelands inspiration was no longer Dev
but Development. However, the mood
which emerged as Whitaker’s recom-
mendations went into effect was that
of the Republic’s springtime rather than
a Celtic twilight and, reflecting this,
Coogan writes with the optimism of a
new frontiersman.
His evidence is the lilt of the Irish
economy, the quiescence of the IRA
which is the subject of one of his best
chapters, the meetings between the
Northern Ireland Prime Minister Cap-
tain Terence O’Neill and the Irish


Prime Minister Sean Lemass. But the
patient knitting of better relations be-
tween north and south through unions,
parliamentarians’ exchange visits, co-
operation on agriculture, power re-
sources, and tourism recorded by Coo-
gan in his ecumenical chapter on the
north, which his family was forced to
leave by religious bigotry, seems threat-
ened now by the immoderate Moderator
of the Free Presbyterians, the Reverend
lan Paisley. Only half a paragraph is
devoted to Paisley in “Ireland Since
the Rising,” but Coogan describes the
background of rancor so ably that the
emergence of such a figure seems an
almost inevitable reaction to the sug-
gestion that old hates be abandoned.

JOINT-ENTERPRISE productions are
more and more a feature of the publish-
ing world. Francoise Sagan’s-Bernard
Buffet’s “Toxique” was an obvious re-
cent linking of fashionable friends to
make the kind of ephemeral glossy pro-
duction that seems to have become
popular. But the modestly priced and
varied Australian Letters Publications
“Australian Artists and Poets Booklets”
show what can be achieved in this field
when artists and poets of some affinity
put their talents together—when Clifton
Pugh illustrates Judith Wright, or James
McAuley writes texts to accompany
Leonard French’s “The Six Days of
Creation.” Of course, poems must exist
independently and so must paintings
and sketches; it is perhaps the value of
the “Australian Artists and Poets Book-
lets” that the talents are combined to
preserve the full independence of both
participants.
An experiment of a different kind —
a real combination of forces with two
artists working in close conjunction—
is Thom and Ander Gunn’s “Positives”
—a remarkable book of photographs
and poems arranged to counterpoint
and reinforce each other so that they
form an organic whole. The first
photograph is of a newly born child;
one of the last the haunting figure of an
old derelict woman rooting about in a
heap of city rubbish. The whole book
sketches in slightly, lightly the
possibilities and the limitations of
human destiny, the various aspects of
ages, and does so through a wide range
of tones.
As one might expect, the photos of
children and adolescents are especially
moving. The arrogance of childhood is
captured in a photo of a girl sitting
sprawled with something of the air of
a Velasquez infanta and something of
the air of King Farouk, accompanied
by the text:
“ ‘Drink Me’
6 Eat Me’
and you grew or shrank.
Here you have to wait.
Tn a bus it is nice to ride on top
because it looks like running
people over.”
There are girls crossing the road in
a state' of complete self-containment
and a youth (“Youth is power. He
knows it,/a rough young animal, but/
an animal that can smile”) holds his
hand toward the camera: “He makes,
now,/a fine gesture, inviting/experience
to try him.”
Those familiar with Thom Gunn’s
poetry will recognise here his saintly
cyclists, his Elvis Presley types; his pre-
occupation with natural energy and the
will. His obsession with hands (“delicate
and precise instruments”) is given a
fine articulation in the poem about Pete
the laborer who turns musician at
night; . while “Lebensraum” (“life
should be a humane/undertaking. I
know I/undertook it”) develops an im-
portant later Gunn theme (solitude and
solidarity the drama of the isolating
ego) with beautiful accuracy.
With some exceptions, the poems are
inseparable from the photographs which
accompany them. And both are remark-
able for their unsentimental, because
disciplined, tenderness of concern.
When a poet, through years of disci-
pline and sheer hard work, has achieved
the fineness of Philip Larkin, it is of
special interest to see his earliest pro-
ductions. Larkin’s “The North Ship”
was first published in 1945, and no critic
could be harsher about his book than
the author himself, who has now most
reluctantly consented to its re-publica-
tion. The book is heavily derivative. The
Yeats influences are everywhere, in cad-
ence, phrasing, and idea even in
unnamed gnomic pieces like No. XXVI;
This is the first thing
I have understood:
Time is the echo of an axe
Within a wood.
but they are seen at their best in the
title piece, a legend, which prefigures
“Next, Please” one of the best of all
the poems in “The Less Deceived.” This
reissue is valuable for its long introduc-
tion, and it should bring comfort to
many.
A selection of Jon Silkin’s poems has
been needed for some time now and
“Poems New and Selected” gathers to-
gether 12 years’ work. Silkin has always
been best known for his early, post-
Dylan Thomas-ish poems like the
famous and much anthologised “Death
of a Son” and for his allegorical animal
poems, including a “Death of a Bird,”
which is worth comparing with A. D.
Hope’s poem of the same name, if only
to see how the poetry is in the treat-
ment and not in the subject. But from
now on his extraordinary flower poems
are likely to remain the part of his
work which will command the widest
respect and attention. They are 'full of
surprising and convincing images as
when he says that lilies of the valley
are “white as babies’ teeth,” or of
daisies, “They ask for attention/with
that gradated yellow swelling/of oily
stamens. Petals focus them:/The eye-
lashes grow wide.”
It is good to have Robert Creeley’s
“Poems” complete in one volume, if
only to find out at last that he is not
at all like Mallarme as his devotees
and admirers have been claiming. With
Mallarme the poetry is in the resonance
of the word, with Creeley in the space
between two words where the space
matters more than the words that sur-
round it. This book shows, too, that
Creeley has a far simpler talent than is
sometimes recognised. What is so arch-
modernist about “The Bird”
What did you say to me
that I had not heard.
She said she saw
a small bird.
Where was it.
In a tree.
Ah, he said, I thought
you spoke to me.
It is hard to believe that the big
message that will save modern poetry
is going to come down from the Black
Mountain.
Crazy fable
By NANCY KEESING
The Golden Kiss. Anthony Carson.
Methuen. $2.65.
“THE GOLDEN KISS” unashamedly
derives to some extent from “The
Golden Ass.” Carson, as challenger,
presents no threat whatever to Apuleius,
but his zany fable has, like its pre-
decessor, wit, charm, and in some of
its imagery an approach to poetry.
Carson likes to enter his works of
fiction as a central character in his own
name. On this occasion he becomes
involved, via a bank clerk friend who
experiments with black magic, in a
complicated comedy of altered and
confused identity, crime both local and
international, and with several gorgeous
women. The setting is Soho.
“The Golden Kiss” is nearer to some-
thing between spoof and burlesque than
to satire. A good deal of the fun is
pretty knockabout and predictable. A
hearty vicar addressing a youth group
says: “I want you all to enter the Army
of God. I want you to wave goodbye to
sin, to keep your thoughts as clean as
your motor-cycles, and leave each other
strictly alone until you are married . . .”
But sometimes the wit is more stylish,
as in the discussion between Carson
and the ambiguous Inspector Gladcliff,
who postulates “The Young” as Eng-
land’s most besetting problem. “You
can’t trap them any more. Not with the
old tricks, straight, shoulder-to-shoulder
talk, advice about girls, not even art
like Beethoven or Elgar. Beethoven and


violins and Rupert Brooke, they were
grand for youth who didn’t kick foot-
balls about.
“No, they have invented something.
They have invented something miser-
able and marvellous like children aban-
doned on an island . . . It’s war,” said
the Inspector ... “a horrible war . . .
but it’s well planned. We’re starting
with flattery, we soften them up, and
then we hand them over to the generals
and the bishops for a grand universal
crucifixion . . . Not that I don’t like
young people,” he said.
Of course, the wicked Inspector is
no more than echoing what some people
have long and widely asserted: that no
one of thirty years and upward has a
hope of understanding the language,
let alone the ideas, aspirations, moral
values, and general behaviour of the
teenage-twenties group.
Capital Territory
I In Civic Square columns of gold mosaic
Brighten the wan blue air; flowers bake
In cauldrons the color of mud.
A bronze angel threatens us with a dove
Held aloft like an axe-head.
The oblong pool’s plaque of sky
Rains upward, or precisely simulates
Four burst mains.
II Along the arcade with the golden columns
The air sighs like a young banker
Dreaming of first set-downs
On Moon, Mars, Mercury;
Of old worlds to conquer.
The air is light blue, the summer
Clouds white as winter. Our friend
Reminds us with love of the city’s
Deep-freezing off-season.
He has us in his protective custody.
111 The arcade holds us in a trance
Of gold; the disembodied chirps
And bird-calls of the Incas
Warn us of faulty air-conditioning
Somewhere within the building
Outside ourselves. We pause to look
Past books and people
Through the un-walls of the Civic Library.
Visitors are seated in low arm-chairs,
Lapped in colored magazines,
Tagged with cameras.
Inhabitants are putting/taking,
Lightly clothed.
IV Is it recurrent thoughts
Of winter temperatures ice-cubing
Civic Square, wind-tunnelling
The golden arcade make us shiver
For the orlon-slacked and shirted locals?
Or the reflected Damoclean
Dove? We see ourselves at last,
Transparent, fadingly
Run-through with laser shafts
Of the goldfingering sun.
BRUCE BEAVER
Gangster
by JOHN BAXTER
Little Caesar. W. R. Burnett. Nickolas
Vane. $3.25.
ONLY A FEW worthwhile works of
popular fiction have survived the
’twenties, and “Little Caesar” is among
the best of them. Written in 1929, it is
a work born of moral indignation. It
deals with gang warfare in Chicago,
and the rise, fall, and extinction of one
ambitious but insufficiently resilient
racketeer. Rico begins as gunman to an
established member of the Italian-
dominated underworld, progresses to the
position of his chief’s successor, then
dies in a gun battle with police, victim
of a henchman’s error in some forgotten
robbery. Simple and direct, “Little
Caesar” is as typical as a biog-
raphy from “Lives Of One Hundred
Great Millionaires.” That he dies
ignominiously at the end is seen as an
inevitable fate, as certain as the senior
civil servant’s OBE. No end but a vio-
lent one, Burnett righteously suggests,
is ever possible for the criminal. It is
the inbuilt concomitant of the life of
terror.
Burnett is no stylist, and much of
“Little Caesar’s” timeless impact stems
from the simple directness of its exposi-
tion. It is no coincidence that the book
made a successful film of 1930, and that
Edward G. Robinson’s impersonation
of Rico is still something of a Holly-
wood symbol of big crime’s combined
glamor and evil. The writer later be-
came a major scenarist, and his later
novels (“The Iron Man,” “The Asphalt
Jungle”) use the same cold, cinematic
style that makes “Little Caesar” so read-
able.
Dialogue is terse, sharp. Burnett
makes the special clumsiness of broken
English painfully obvious in Rico’s con-
versations with the few ordinary people
he meets, and the particular vulgarity
of the period crops up again and again
in incidents like clothing, jewellery, and
slang. The recurring image of a flash-
ing dancehall sign is typical of the
book and also, it seems, of the period.
Many of the early-’thirties crime films
have a scabrous tone, the look of neon
light, and sunless streets.
Against “Little Caesar,” modern
crime novels are tame, deficient in all
the qualities which make this book so
arresting. Today, one is unable to be-
come especially involved in the concept
of righteous legislation, nor understand
the anger which Burnett, in common
with many others, felt in this time at
the blatant operations of the bigger
gangs. Modern public indignation is
reserved for juvenile delinquency and
child molestation; anger at the threat
of violence to one’s person or to those
unable to protect themselves supersedes
the essentially moral anger at the con-
cept of lawlessness and “organised*
crime; Perhaps the ludicrousness to us
today of prohibition is an index of how
far we have come since “Little Caesar.”


As foreshadowed in the Annual Report for
1965. the combined profit of the British Tobacco
Company group increased in the year ended
3 Ist October. 1966. the Chairman. Mr. T. J. N.
Foley, said in his annual Review.
The group consolidated profit, before tax-
ation. but after providing $4,236,238 for depre-
ciation, was $14,585,887. This compared with
$12,438,378 last year.
Mr. Foley’s Review continued:
"After providing $6,340,491 for income tax.
the group profit was $8,245,396.
"An amount of $779,033 is attributable to out-
side shareholders in subsidiary companies, thus
leaving a profit, after tax. of $7,466,363 directly
belonging to the shareholders of British Tobacco
Company (Australia) Limited.
“Out of profits from the year under review,
an interim dividend of 6% on Ordinary and ‘B’
Ordinary Shares was paid and a final dividend
of 6% on Ordinary and ‘B’ Ordinary Shares has
been declared, thus bringing the total dividend
for the year to 12%,‘the highest rate paid by
your Company since 1930.
“Revenue Reserves and Undistributed Profits
were increased by $3,996,065. and included in
this figure are amounts of $2,707,087, repre-
senting operating profit retained in the business,
and $499,103. representing profit on the sale of
fixed assets, mainly buildings no longer required
for operational purposes.
“This profit on the sale of fixed assets was
transferred directly to Revenue Reserves and it
is not included in the profit figures mentioned
above.
“In addition, an examination of the Company's
provisions revealed that the provision for depre-
ciation on buildings was in excess of actual
requirements, since so many of the Company’s
older buildings have in recent years been sold.
Of this excess, $750,000 has been transferred to
Revenue Reserves.
“This year’s profit, exceeding as it does the
profit for the previous year, until then the highest
in the Company’s history, can be considered a
pleasing result and is due to improved perfor-
mance by each of the operating subsidiaries.
W.D. & H.O. Wills (Australia) Limited, Leigh-
Mardon Pty. Limited and, to a lesser extent.
Associated Products & Distribution Pty. Limited.
W.D. & H.O. WILLS (AUST.) LTD.
“A major contribution to increase in profit has
come from the largest of our subsidiaries, W.D.
& H.O. Wills (Australia) Limited, which in spite
of very intensive competition in the cigarette
market has achieved a substantial increase both
in volume of sale and in percentage share of
market.
“The results attained are particularly gratify-
ing in view of the fact that during the second
half of the year each of the Company’s major
brands was subjected to a competitive attack
from either a newly introduced brand or a
re-designed version of an existing offer.
“Despite these challenges the Company’s
share of market was substantially higher than
twelve months ago.
“Several brands have in combination con-
tributed to this satisfactory position, but in par-
ticular Benson and Hedges is showing strong
signs of growth and is undoubtedly the fastest
growing brand in Australia. Both Craven Filter
and Escort have also made significant gains in
the market.
“A number of new brands, including Players
Filter Tipped cigarettes, Imperial Crown Instant
Pipe Refills and Statesman Cigars were intro-
duced during the year.
“These new introductions were intended in
each case to fill a specific consumer need and are
a further extension of the long-standing Com-
British
Tobacco’s
Report
on 1966
pany policy of offering consumers a wide range
of smoking products in varying price categories
to suit individual requirements.
"Whilst it is gratifying to report that for the
first time in a decade the Company has been
the largest producer of filter-tipped cigarettes in
Australia, it is realised that because of the intense
competition in this fashion-type industry, change
is the essence of the market situation.
“The policy of supplying to the consumer the
highest possible quality in each price range and
the techniques of marketing, both of which have
been so successful, will be continued with even
greater intensity in order to expand both the
volume of sales and share of the market.
LEIGH-MARDON PTY. LIMITED
"Competition was not restricted to the cigar-
ette field, for in many sections of the printing
and packaging industry, in which the Leigh-
Mardon companies are engaged, competitive
activity was greatly intensified.
“This generally took the form of price reduc-
tion and. under these circumstances, it is very
pleasing to report that the Leigh-Mardon group
had a satisfactory improvement in its sales per-
formance and operating profits when compared
with the previous year.
"The organisational changes, commenced in
1965 and referred to last year, have led to a
closer integration of the marketing and produc-
tion facilities of the group, and it is anticipated
that during 1967 these will be advanced to a
stage where Leigh-Mardon will be equipped to
use fully a co-ordinated range of printing and
packaging skills to supply its many customers in
all States of Australia.
"Dodge Consolidated Industries group, in
which Leigh-Mardon holds a majority interest,
has continued to function as a substantially
independent organisation.
“The pleasing improvement in Dodge Con-
solidated profits over those of the previous year
is worthy of special note, particularly as the
advance occurred in an extremely competitive
year for fibre container makers.
ASSOCIATED PRODUCTS &
DISTRIBUTION PTY. LIMITED
“Associated Products & Distribution Pty.
Limited also showed an improved performance
in that the overall result for the company has
revealed a small profit compared with last year’s
loss.
“However, the return on capital employed is
still only nominal, and the year just completed
must be regarded merely as one additional stage
in developing this new venture to be a satis-
factory financial investment.
“Some of the subsidiary companies of Asso-
ciated Products & Distribution Pty. Limited have
shown very pleasing results, but the performance
over all subsidiaries has been extremely uneven.
"The operations of the Pastoral Division of
the Company were again seriously affected by
drought. In New South Wales, these drought
conditions prevailed for most of the year and
continued high expenses were incurred in trans-
port. stock-feeding and agistment.
"However, all stud stock and breeders have
been maintained and. with the breaking of the
drought in the spring of 1966. the properties
came through with young and breeding stock in
better condition than they were a year ago.
“Development work continued during the
drought months and the watering facilities newly
will provide greater safety for stock-
handling under any future dry conditions.
"Good spring and follow-up rains have enabled
stock development programmes to be resumed.
COURAGE BREWERY—VICTORIA
"An announcement was made on 2nd Novem-
ber, 1966, of plans to establish a second brewery
in Victoria.
“In this new venture your Company has as
partners the well-known English brewers Courage.
Barclay & Simonds Limited, who have had
extensive experience not only in the United
Kingdom but also in other international markets,
and a group of experienced Melbourne hoteliers.
"It is intended at a later stage that shares in
the new company will be offered to the general
public.
“All those associated with this new project do
not underestimate the difficulties which are likely
to be experienced in establishing a new brewery,
particularly where the market is dominated by
a large and efficient competitor.
“Nevertheless, a market survey has convinced
us that a small but profitable share of the market
could be obtained providing that the beer is of
the standard and quality which the Australian
public has come to demand.
“We have no doubt that, backed by the tech-
nical skills and resources of Courage, Barclay
& Siinonds Limited, the new brewery will be
able to produce beer of this type and quality
“In the light of experience gained over the
past two to three years, your Directors are
still confident of the soundness of the policy
announced some years ago that, whilst vigor-
ously pursuing growth and expansion in our
traditional industry of tobacco and cigarettes,
the Company should also extend its activities
into other industries and so create a broader
basis for growth in future years.
“The total Company profits for 1966 are evi-
dence of a very successful year, but the Directors
are aware that some of the new activities must
be classified as problems.
“We are confident that the overall performance
of the Company can be still further improved,
both by special attention to these problem areas
and by lifting general efficiency in all operating
divisions.”

LETTERS
Holt's Australia
Alan Reid’s observations on “Holt’s Can-
berra” (8., March 25) seem somehow
to both hit and miss the target. Mr.
Reid (unintentionally, perhaps) gives
the impression that the only place in
ferment is Canberra, whereas what we
are really seeing is the beginnings of a
complete mental reorientation through-
out the country, of which the revolution
in the parliamentary mind is but a
mirror. ♦
It seems that the conservatives may
at last be coming to terms with their
own country (and, for that matter, the
radicals who are alienated from it, such
as in Dr. Cairns’ recent Wilsonian
speech which utilised a set of operators
meant to solve some problems that do
not even exist in Australia).
The sense of dissatisfaction with the
dynamics of Australian development has
been felt by the younger generation for
some time now. Until recently this was
only voiced as a deep inchoate frustra-
tion with the “do nothings” that seemed
to be in power, and the place where
this frustration was felt strongest was
within the universities. Student demon-
strations have been concerned with
easing the pressure more than anything
else, regardless of what they seemed to
be about at the time.
Mr. Holt’s task is to find dynamics
that will reconcile the two universes
and at the same time lessen the aliena-
tion of Australians from their own
country. Holt may yet preside over a
flowering of the Australian civilisation
if he will let it grow unimpeded by re-
strictions from outside. None of us yet
know what it really means to be an
Australian.

Trains in Spain
It is a pity that Mr. Barry Jones (8.,
March 25) wasn’t prepared to spend a
little more in time and money in going
to one of the many reputable travel
agencies where English is spoken, to
organise his journey to Madrid. This
could have been undertaken in com-
fort in either the lalgo or the Sud
Expres, complete with sleepers and all
mod cons, and in half the time. Con-
trary to Mr. Jones’ assumption, at Irun
station there is an adequate dining-
room of much higher quality than the
general Australian variety, and also
clean and comfortable washrooms.
The reason for the necessary change
in trains at Irun is a simple one that
any Australian should understand a
difference in rail gauge between French
and Spanish railway systems.
However, as Mr. Jones is obviously of
the do-it-yourself variety of tourist, he
really cannot blame anyone but him-
self if he suffered discomfort and in-
convenience. But then it all makes
for a good story.

End of the Affair
Your cover story “Britain —The End
Of The Affair” (8., April 8) stated that
it would be a “bold prophet” who
would forecast Australia’s transition to
Republic “in terms of timetables.” The
infant, yet booming, Australian Repub-
lican Party is that bold. The Party’s
“timetable” is: 1969 contest all
Federal seats in Victoria, and possibly
Queensland; support all candidates
with a full-scale publicity campaign in
the Press, on TV, and radio. 1970
the first Republican Member(s) in the
House of Representatives. 1972
contest all Federal seats in Victoria,
Queensland, New South Wales, and
South Australia. 1973 —more Repub-
licans in Federal Parliament. 1975 —
contest all Federal seats in Australia.
1976 —form the Federal Government,
and conduct a referendum to alter the
Constitution and enable proclamation
of the Republic.
In 1976 we will also change the flag
and National Anthem (if it hasn’t
previously been done) in accordance
with popular choice. You might say
this timetable is not only “bold,” but
“excessively optimistic.” If you do,
then you would deny the very sound
bases for your article, overlook the
extraordinary youth of the electorate in
1975 and its high percentage of first-
time Australian voters of non-British
stock (the products of post-war migra-
tion), and fail to foresee the long-term
consequences of Britain’s very probable
early entry into the Common Market.
One of the very good reasons for
this Party’s confidence is the increase
in our membership strength from about
40 in Victoria at the time of the
November elections to around 900 now
(and growing at the rate of ten a day).
The poll you quoted gave 28 percent
of Australians as declared Republicans.
If my memory serves me correctly,
there were also 14 percent “undecided.”
If we as a Party could persuade that
14 percent, we’d be in.

Better Boxing
Discus (8., March 25) says; “Boxing
has taken the full count in Australia.
There is overwhelming evidence that
the public no longer wants boxing.”
Surely that is debatable. Discus might
have been nearer the mark had he
said that boxing as promoted by some
of the stadiums is no longer drawing
crowds. The main trouble with most
Stadium promotions is that not enough
money is being offered to boys in pre-
liminaries and minor events.
At the South Sydney Rugby Leagues
Club, where a full night’s boxing is
staged every second week, the bouts are
well staged and well controlled and
brutality has not been evident on the
occasions I have been there.
These events are so popular that the
clubs have difficulty accommodating
patrons in the very large auditorium
usually available, and the proceedings
are relayed by closed-circuit television
to adjoining rooms, also packed. Boxers
are paid considerably more than at
most stadiums.
Given comfortable surroundings,
proper facilities, and a reasonable stan-
dard of performance which pre-
supposes adequate remuneration for the
performers and the crowds will still
patronise boxing. Incidentally, the
crowds attending sports club bouts con-
tain a very high percentage of women.

Very Dry Run
After reading “Very dry run” in your
AUSTRALIA section (8., March 25)
I felt positively irate. How wrong the
traveller in his horrid little remarks
regarding the cleanest, sweetest-smell-
ing, truly Australian ship ever. During
the past 18 months my husband and I
have enjoyed two return trips on the
Empress. We smoke, drink, do not
play cards, and, especially, do not
talk. We sipped drinks in a leisurely
fashion before dinner in the very
pleasant bar with a courteous steward.
Getting there is half the fun
perhaps your grog lover should spend
more time on the voyage observing
the freedom and wheeling of the alba-
tross, the flights of the seagulls with
sunlight shining through them, the
clouds of dark mutton birds smudging
the blue, and also his fellow men.
Our very own bottle of Scotch rode
out the journey on a dressing-table.
Your Bulletin traveller has no soul!
