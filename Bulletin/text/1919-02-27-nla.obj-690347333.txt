Man-Love and the Gods
Before Asia imposed her variegated and
curiously ill-fitting stock of religious ideas
upon the white man, Europe had developed
at least three sets of mind deities. Other
gods there were in plenty, from the stone
pillars which a primitive race worshipped
in western France,, to the rude and rather
childish monsters who conducted the cosmos
for tlie Teutons Throns-h o l-ife Norse and
101 tne leutons. „.iniougima late Noise ana
Icelandic medium Thor, Odin, and the rest
have come down to us rationalised and im-
proved by comparison with the gods of
cither peoples; but in spite of all that can
be done for them, they remain rough-voiced,
loutish creatures with a blood-lust like
Apaches and the humor of school-boy
dunces. No account need be taken of them,
They were nature deities of a sort, com-
parable to the Titans of Greek myth or the
Fomorians of Irish story; but, like most
things made in Germany, they were in no
real sense the product of a higher mental
activity.
The Greek Olympians, on the other hand,
were intellectual conceptions of a cultured
and thoughtful people. Though many of
the gods themselves appear to have been
borrowed from Asia, the Greek mind clothed
them with new attributes and gave them a
new and sweeter life. Apollo smacks noth-
ing of the East. He is the very type and
embodiment of all. that Europe thought
best—-music, light, beauty, poetry, speed—
and liis association with the sun shows how
all these ideas ran back to deep roots in an
old nature-worship.
The Roman gods were of another kind,
but equally the product of mental activity,
According to Mommsen, Mars was origin-
ally the only god of the clan — the killer,
the destroyer of foes, was the divine friend
they most needed. After him came others
who were merely everyday ideas personified.
Thus: Jove Fivil Order—a sort of

glorified spiritual Lord Mayor; while Mer-
curv to an early Roman meant Trade and
nothing move The intellectual victory of
Greece over Rome caused a change. Roman
gods were brought into conformity with
those Of Attica, which most resembled them;
and wheie a gap occuiiec in the Roman
pantheon the Greek deity to fill it was

where King Lear is none other than Lir,
the god of the sea, whose name also clings

conception to the Greek Apollo, has left
his name in London at Ludgate Hill; and

t a ■. linked lip with her old shline at
Kildare, is a finer Diana—her purity the
mother-chastity that guards the family life.
Thousands of Irish women still wear her
name; and up in the Hebrides it is said
that even to-day dour Presbyterian mothers
make secret offerings to her when they de-
sire children. Mananan, son of Lir, circles
the western seas in his wonderful ship, and
when the storms rage his great hounds are
heard barking over the foaming tops; but
Mananan, too, is very wise in council. The
gods call him to their aid when the problems
of life grow too acute. .
But the most remarkable of all Celtic
gods is Angus. Greece thought of Aphro-
dite, goddess of love and beauty, freshly
risen from the sea-foam. Rome, adopting
Greek notions, exalted Venus—originally
a person of very minor importance—to the
throne of love. In Ireland alone, as once
in all Celtiea, the presiding spirit of love
is a man. Angus stands for man-love, the
kind of love the Celt understood, and per-
haps still understands, an idea utterly dif-
ferent from any which had been evolved by
Greek or Roman. To them love was an
effeminate business, a man’s pastime of an
hour, a slave woman’s value in the market.
It had nothing to do with home or children
or companionship. Phryne was honored of
all Athens, but she had no proposals of
marriage to speak of. Paris was despised
almost as a degenerate because of his passion
for Helen; Anthony became the jest of
Rome when Cleopatra, once the plaything
of Ciesar, made him a slave to her charms.
The Roman matron was a proud dame,
but her husband never pretended to love
her. Had he done so she would probably
have scorned him. All these ideas belonged
only to the time when the gods were believed
in; with the coming of the Empire and the
corruption which made place for Christian-
ity all values changed and all old religious
ideas went overboard.
But in Celtiea the woman and man stood
together in a different relation. Queetf Maev
is mentioned a hundred times for once that
her perfectly respectable and hard-fighting
husband gets into the limelight. The wife
went into battle with her husband and made
her voice heard in the affairs of the state.
Her beauty was his pride and her companion-
ship the thing worth living for. They needed
a god of man-love there; and in the concep-
tioii of Angus they found him. He is. in
point of fact, there still; for the old gods
live on through all changes. Julian the
Apostate found it impossible to revive the
worship of Apollo; but there is no need
for an edict of the Sinn Fein republic to
bring back Ireland’s old gods. They are
there in the green fairy mounds; they come
out at night to ride with laughter over the
land; they slid into Shakspeare s dreams
and tinged the Greek fancies of Keats. In
Australia, which is one-third Irish in race
and five-sixths Irish in spirit, Angus sets a
white foot on the sandstone ridges and
walks in flashing cloak over the plains ot
the west. For the Australian, too, loves
with a man-love ; and Aphrodite presides over
the back lane, while the young god from the
banks of the Boyne* laughs in the full sun-
shine.
D.M.W.
*The palace of Angus-Og is still there by the
Boyne. The faith lives that, with the right kind
of eyes, you could sec it any time of day or night.
The Ethics of a Military Prison
When the Australian press mission went
to Ireland it found waiting for it on the quay
at Queenstown a silent young Irish officer
with a limp. Very tardily during the next
few days the silent young man told a little
about himself, mostly to explain why he
wasn’t still at the Front. He had had the
bad luck to be taken prisoner rather early in
the proceedings and —well, he had escaped,
as it was his duty to (on this point, he was
insistent) ; and he had (he apologised for
this) written a book, though he didn’t know
whether it was worth printing, because so
much of what might be interesting couldn’t
be told: it would make it harder for
others to get away. Here is the book, My
German Prisons, by Captain Galliland, of
the Loyal North Lancashires (Hodder and
Stoughton).
It was worth printing, after all. Galli-
land is no writer; but you can forgive the
skin for the sake of the sausage. And a
good deal also for the sake of the man who
did the things that make the book. He
wasn’t a nice prisoner. He says plainly
that at all times he gave the Boches all the
trouble he could.
We did not give them very much peace whenever
the opportunity arose to do otherwise, consequently
our guard was doubled at the fortress, which pleased
us very much, since we felt that we were keeping a
number of men away from the Front and thus still
helping to do our little share towards winning the
war.
And for the same reason he never disguised
his intention of trying to escape. There
was certainly nothing that was worth stay-
ing for, though Galliland noticed a consider-
able improvement as the Boche became less
confident, which in his case meant less arro-
gant. Galliland’s own worst experience
were probably in what he calls the hell-hole
of Ingolstadt. The cells were underground;
they were overcrowded; they were foetid;
moisture dripped from the walls.
In January the thermometer stood at 32deg. cen-
trigrade below freezing-point. Let the reader imagine
what that means in an underground stone cell. Cer-
tainly we did- not then suffer from damp, since
everything was ice. Our drainage vent was solid ice
about a foot thick.
Everyone fell ill; but there was no medical
attendance r
An officer in my wing was taken with violent fever
and fearful pain in breathing, which turned out to
be double-pneumonia. We tried in vain to get some
medical help, but were only laughed at from the
other side of the iron-studded door, and told that the
swine officer must take his chance.
In theory the Boche admitted .that the •■swine
had a right to escape from their German
sties if they could; and as he found that
some of them would certainly try to escape
as long as they could stand on their legs,
he decided that it was better to kill them
and save the guards. The plan was tried
early in some cases. In Galliland’s, for
instance, immediately after he had been
wounded and taken prisoner;
We came to a trench on which our artillery was
ranging. Our guards took a little rest, and we were
ordered out of the trench to stand on the parapet.
And before this:
I was horrified_to see Germans finishing off our
wounded with their bayonets.... As we were hurried
on, regardless of our wounds, we could hear squeals
and cries, showing that the Boches were still carry-
ing on with the shameful murdering of our helpless
wounded.
And long afterwards, being pronounced to be
suffering from rheumatism, he was packed off
to Claustlial, to be welcomed by the Comman-
dant with: “What! you’ve come here for
treatment for rheumatism! You could not
come to a worse place for it! We’ve no treat-
ment here of any sort—never had. There
is not even a hospital here.”. And he laughed
at the great joke.
The last third of the book is devoted to a
very readable account of the writer’s perilous
escape. And here, again. Galliland shows
how he expected the same idea of attempted
escape to be in every good officer’s mind.
Twenty-five of them were being shifted from
one prison to another:
I fv. We i 2 tternpted t 0 esca P e without the knowledge
ot the others we should certainly spoil their chance.
Since we were all British officers together we decided
to make it known to those who looked or acted as if
they were looking for a chance.
Th e book is dedicated t 0 James W. Gerard,
late U.b.A Ambassador at Berlin. Gerard
“ 15 ,,?., 1)e hoped, will commend it to Wood-
row Wilson. He is a busy man; but. as the
notice outside the street-cars of his own
wt r Clt K eS Saj ViT, ou can,t afford to be too
busy to be careful.

DELGO-LIGHT IS SIMPLE, EFFICIENT and DURABLE.
DELCO-LIGHT consists of an engine, generator,
switchboard and set of batteries. The engine
and generator are direct connected, which does
away with any transmission losses or belt trouble, in-
creasing the efficiency of the machine. The storage
battery is of the special Delco-Light type, consisting of
sixteen glass jar cells, delivering 32-volt current. Unless
the demand for light and power is very heavy, it is
unnecessary to run the engine, except when the storage-
battery requires recharging.
Electricity is stored up in the battery by means of
the generating unit. Wires lead from the light and power
connections to this storage-battery, from which electric
current is used as desired for light or power.
You will find Delco-Light to be a model of simplicity.
When it becomes necessary to re-charge the battery the
engine is started by- merely pressing on the starting-
switch located on the switchboard. This electrically
cranks the engine, just as the automobile engine is
cranked by an electric self-starter. The engine starts
running on its own power in a few seconds. It can then
be left to itself, as when the battery is completely charged
the Delco-Light engine stops automatically.
■ ——
The supply of kem gon ° is regulated by means o
a simple lever-operated mixing valve. Moving the lever
to the right or left regulates the supply of fuel.
There is only one place to put oil. The crank case
is designed to hold about three quarts of oil, and a rapidly
revolving gear carries a fine spray to all parts requiring
lubrication.
The reliability of Delco-Light has been proved through
actual service under trying conoitions. It has been
thoroughly tested in every possible way, both in the shop
and in practical service on the farm and in the home.
Nothing has been left to chance. The tests have been
more severe than any service an owner would require.
Delco-Light is made by the same Works which have
Delco-Lighted and started over one million Motor-cars.

Blossoming Cacti.
Dreaming of far-off deserts, in the murk
Of hot and moonless nights in Brisbane
town,
Each sap-filled leaf arrayed in spear and
dirk,
They look like stars themselves come
drifting down
As slowly in the midnight garden pent
They wake to blossom through their dis-
content.
By day they close their eyes and lie asleep;
The dust from street and road comes drift-
ing in ;
Who knows but in their hearts the cacti
weep
Green heavy tears for their long-sundered
kin—
Flags of the Open Plain who own a world,
While theirs in narrow garden plots are
furled?
On these hot nights I think they hear the
wind
Sigh through old memories, and the jackal
slink
By the sand dunes some laggard prey to
find;
The scampering scorpion, in his coat of
ink,
Threads in and out the glistening cacti-
grove
To some mysterious rendezvous of love —
Seed of those other cacti, desert-bred,
Offspring of some spiked hedge that spans
the wild,
Remembering through those channels,
parent-fed,
How the red dawn on desert abres smiled,
And how, across the long and burning sands.
Pale Evening came with comfort in her
hands!

M. FORREST.
A Song of Lusts.
WANDER-LUST.
Born of the lust your fathers had in the
questing days of yore,
When the heart-beats leapt to the call of the
sea or the lure of a distant shore,
I still may nest in the heart of a man and
hale him forth at will
To jeer at Death in a rotten ship, or climb
earth’s farthest hill.
For low I sing in my nest, but strong is the
urge of my lilting tune,
And he who hears me pants again for the
sweep of the rippling dune,
For the sob of the tide, for the rolling plain
in some green land afar,
For a city shining radiantly beneath a dis-
tant star.
Aye, the winds call loud, and the seas croon
low to him who cradles me,
Of the beautiful, luring Distant Things, and
will not let him be.
Love-lust.
I am the lust with the laughing eyes and the
red mouth like a rose,
And never so far a man may win but that my
song with him goes.
For mine is the universal song that quickens
with dancing fire
The sluggish veins, till they riot red in the
thrillings of fierce desire.
Keeper of life’s replenishment and the birth-
gates of the world,
I nod, and lo! in a flooding joy the young in
the womb is curl’d.
And I am the juggler that jeers at Death,
for, swift as he empties breath,
I pour it forth in a surer mould as I laugh
in the eyes of Death !
Gold-lust.
Under the flow of your suavities, close-hid
’neath your sleekest smile,
Beneath the gleam of your every dream I
wait and I watch the while
I scatter the spawn of my demon-creed on
the tide of your hopes and fears
Till your hearts are rife with my crafty sins,
oozing spume of men’s blood and tears.
My laughter rings as my talons tear at the
beautiful things I’ve slain —
The high intent, and the selfless love, and
man’s care for mankind’s pain ;
For as nought to me are your cultured loves —
I suck at their very bfeath,
Till their high song sinks to a snarling sigh,
and they pass on the wings of death.
n.s.w.
HELEN BURKE.
The Dead.
The cold, green grass is thick above their
graves,
Nor sun nor moon shall bring romance
again,
_ Nor ever the low murmur of the rain
Thrill with delight the mouldering dust it
laves;
Only the wind that sweeps in shadowy
waves
Through that green sea shall fitfully com-
plain.
For they have laid aside both joy and
pain
And their worn flesh has the deep rest it
craves.
They have renounced all earthly lust and
store.
Poor, chaste, obedient, taken vows to
Death,
And in his holy orders have such peace
1. hat they lie quiet though the days increase.
And though each Spring with fume of
wanton breath
Whispers that once they loved, they love no
more.

COOLIES AND TENANTS.
A CIRCUMSTANCE worth passing notice
is that, when hordes of persons have beer
dragged up before the penetrating eye of
the Law for failing to wear germ masks,
often nearly half of them have been coolies.
They are called laborers in Australia, but
coolie is shorter. It doesn t necessarily
mean that the coolie is less law-abiding
than people of other classes. It is
simply that he is a very numerous
class. He stands in a general way tor
the section of the community which has
only its muscle to dispose of, the same
as the horse, or only itself to dispose ot,
the same as Rahab. He follows some c .,'
ing, or half-a-dozen callings, that any fairly
strong man can learn without apprentice-
ship. He produces nothing that can be sold
as a superior and high-priced product in
foreign or local markets. _ He produces
nothing that he can be. specially proud o .
his work being done as part of a gang, and
there is little room for ingenuity m his lue
unless he invents a machine for dispensing
with coolies. Such machines are always
being invented, for the man himself is an
understudy to a machine. He has only a
small prospect of getting out of cooliedom
unless he learns a trade; and m a land like
Australia, where the great object of the
Government is to keep down trades m the
importing interest and multiply coolies, the
chances are not many. For the same
reason the coolie’s children are apt to follow
in the old man’s footsteps and be a wharf-
lumper or a railway navvy. The multi-
plication of railways, far m advance of the
increase of population and far in advance
of the earning capacity of the_ lines, helped
to make the element which had only muscle
trv sell a bigger and bigger and more hopeless
and permanent proportion of the race, there
being l no effort to create a corresponding
increase among skilled workers. Thus m
5flOR the States spent £5.200 000 of loans m
findine work for this clement, while in 191.1,
Wit! and 1917 the amount of loan money
-spent yearly was ovei £20,500,0UU.
S L consecutive years the amount was close
on £20,000,000 a year. ■ This -caused a
gigantic growth of the coolie population.
And the population has to be provided for.
Half-a-million expended on creating skilled
industries may start works which will pay
wages to employees or dividends to co-
operators for 100 years and grow larger and
more productive of wages all the tinie. but
120,000.000 a year spent for six years m
multiplying to excess a Government coolie
population which only knows how to shovel
rock and dirt, means nothing more than that
a very big job is finished. Then £20,000,000
a year is wanted afterwards to keep the
workers going, or there is liable to be a great
deal more than £20,000.000 worth of trouble
and misery and fuss. The fairly reasonable
attitude, is taken up that no Government has
a right to rear superfluous coolies and then
turn them adrift any more than it has a
right to rear hogs and then^ starve them.
During the period between 1911 (census
year) and 1917 Australia got rid for the
time of a vast number of people. Of those
who went to the war the purely laboring
class supplied even more than its fair pro-
portion. Among those that remained the
persons employed in definite productive occii-
nations —mining, manufacturing and dairy-
ing, raising sheep, cattle, rabbits and bees
and all the small sundries —decreased by 7036
in the six years mentioned. But the classes
which are not directly productive in the
sense of making things that can be sold—-
clerks, importers, dealers, agents, lawyers
and, above all, coolies —increased by 50,107.
Many of the coolies having gone to the
front the Governments piled up the borrow-
ings and the expenditure on pick-and-shovel
iobs to draw more men into the unskilled
or little-skilled occupations which lead no-
where and provide no future for the workers.
At a time when the war made imported
goods scarce and outrageously dear, and
when the clamor for local manufactured
goods was incessant, it not only refused an
amended tariff so that new industries might
start with a chance of permanency; it went
further and squashed new industries with all
its might by means of its War-time Profits
Tax —not a'tax on profits made by supplying
things necessary to the war, as in Britain,
but a special tax on profits made during the
war. And at the same time it spent money
galore—money borrowed at ruinous rates —
to draw men away from productive indus-
tries and into cooliedom. The railways
built of recent years were not built because
they promoted the development of the coun-
try, for between 1911 and 1917 the number
of people—agricultural, pastoral and min-
ing—employed in the developed country
diminished by 12,209, despite all the new
railways. The lines were built to put up
the selling price of land and to find work for
coolies.
Next to being a coolie it is the Aus-
tralian’s ambition to be a tenant. There
isn't a mile of road or a yard of railway in
this country of which he isn’t a mere tenant,
inasmuch as they are all mortgaged as secur-
ity for the foreign debt. The rent, which is
increasing, is now 4 per cent, on the original
cost of the property, even if the property is
GO years old and dilapidated out of all know-
ledge. The tenant pays all rates and taxes;
also, he pays for repairs and even for the
replacement of the property when it is worn
out. Also, he pays an indefinite bonus every
time the lease faffs in—i.e., every time the
loan has to be renewed. This bonus con-
sists in the cost of floating a fresh loan,
including discount, accrued interest, etc.
Any worker would consider it rough if he
had to pay, in addition to the regular rent
of his £5OO cottage, a lump sum of £57 10s.
simply because his agreement had expired
and he wanted to stay on, but he has done
exactly that sort of thing on a much bigger
scale as tenant of what he foolishly imagines
to be his own public works. He does it
because, as he won’t take the trouble to pay
the debt —in other words, to buy the pro-
perty instead of being a mere occupier—his
creditor is in the position of a landlord who
owns all the houses in the country and can
fix his own terms. Lately the borrowing
Governments of Australia have been offering
6 per cent, rent (called, interest), so that
Australia may be a more incurable tenant
than ever, and its coolie class may multiply
.at the. job of building places (railways) for
which, judging by the decay of the pastoral
and agricultural and mining population,
there is no sub-tenant in view. If a coolie
or any other person paid 11s. 7d. a week for
a shack of five rooms and a kitchen, costing
£5OO to build at present rates, and supplied
the land it was built on, and paid all rates,
taxes and repair bills, and also paid a bonus
when his lease ran out and he wanted a
renewal, and likewise undertook to build a
new house when the old one wore out,
though still paying rent for the old house,
then his position as the individual tenant of
a house and his position as joint tenant of
the national edifice would be the same. And
if he had a national consciousness instead
of only a “class consciousness” (or class
hatred), he would realise that his position
as joint tenant is the more important of the
two. Often the little coolie family of five
which pays rent on £5OO worth of property
to the landlord whom it can see and Aritu-
perate. is also paying rent to a landlord
whom it doesn’t see on about £7OO worth of
property which but for the loan madness
would be its own. And it applauds this
bigger and much harder landlord in coolie
fashion because he supplies money to make
more coolies with.
THE R.A.N. AND THE “MAN ON THE
BEACH.”
It is an ominous circumstance that almost
every recent message from England on Aus-
tralian naval subjects has touched on the
same point—the anxiety of the younger men
in the lower ratings to be demobilised and
finished with the service as soon as possible.
These men are not situated analogously to
the A.1.F.: they did not join up for the
duration of the war intending to revert
afterwards to civilian billets. They chose
the Navy as their life’s work. There must
be something grievously wrong with the
system when such men. after expending some
of their best years on intensive naval train-
ing. and after safely coming through the
greatest of wars, want to get out of a service
that should have everything to offer, materi-
ally as well as in prestige.
It would be unreasonable to bring a soli-
tary exhibit into court, point to it, and
say: “This alone is responsible. The
R.A.N., being modelled on the R.N., is a
conservative institution with little real
enthusiasm for the lower-deck man who
sets out to rise high. It is not, and never
can be, free from political influence. But
the R.A.N., like the R.N., is becoming
democratised, and the politician can only
interfere to a limited extent. One of the
very greatest obstacles to the advancement
of a good many fighting sailors is the long-
shoreman, the “man on the beach,” as they
say in the Navy—the prototype of the Home
Service warrior who has always stood in the
light of certain members of the A.1.F., and
who, so long as there is such a passion ps
self-interest, always will. The situation
dates back to the beginning of things.
Under the Australian Naval Agreement of
1903 a number of Australians were recruited
for service in R.N. ships. It was recog-
nised then, amongst people of vision, and
had no doubt been decided by the Admiralty
in London, that the Australian Navy should
be instituted as soon as possible. The 709
men who joined R.N. ships in Australian
stations between 1903 and 1906 were
deliberately trained for ultimate service in
the fleet that was to be. About 200 of the
best of them were sent to England to qhality
for the higher ratings. They there got
depot training as well as sea-going experi-
ence in the Home Fleet. They had been
specially selected, in the first instance, for
character and ability. It would have been
strange indeed had they not developed into
good sailors. By 1908, when the imminent
arrival of the Australian Navy was known,
the first batch of trainees became due for
their discharges. As they could get no
satisfaction out of the shore authorities at
home with regard to transference to their
national navy a large majority of them left
the sea altogether. The attitude adopted
locally towards these men was that they
belonged not to Australia but to the R.N.
For the past 4$ years many hundreds of
Australians have been out of the Common-
wealth, either on R.A.N. or —through no
choice of their own —on R.N. men-o’-war.
The official attitude locally towards them
is, and always has been, in its essence the
same as it was towards their forerunners of
a decade back. Over and over again “recom-
mends” have been forwarded to Melbourne
urging higher ratings for young Australians
who have done well on active service. In
many cases there have been no replies : the
propositions have been treated as preposter-
ous. As a rule, where a reply has been
sent, the answer was that there were
no vacancies. There are no vacancies
because the shore-going jobs which might
go, as promotion, to Australians who
have distinguished themselves on active
service are filled by Imperial men—chiefly
pensioners from the R.N.
* * * *
The home service man does not merely
enjoy a comfortable and safe job. Like W.
S. Gilbert’s famous character, he flees up
the ladder of promotion at a remarkable
rate —again, of course, to the prejudice of
the sea-going sailor. The following are
concrete cases : —•
A. 8., a Scotchman, was originally in the R.N. He
was engaged by the Naval Board in Melbourne, did
three years’ service in the R.A.N. in and around
Port Phillip, and then got his commission as
engineer-lieutenant.
C.D., an Australian, joined the R.N. in 1906,
under the Australian Naval Agreement, as an engine-
room artificer. He served in seagoing ships on the
Australian station till 1910. In 1910 he went
successively to Portsmouth, Chatham and Plymouth
for depot training. In 1912 he went to the
Clydebank works for the building of the Australia;
he was one of these who “commissioned” her; he
came to Australia aboard her in 1913 ; and he
served with her, uninterruptedly, till the end of
last year. During all that time he because (1)
chief engine-room artificer (qualifying period six
years’ seagoing experience'); (2) artificer- engineer
(qualifying period eight years’ seagoing service),
and (3) at the end of last year, after achieving a
rare decoration, and getting three successive
“recommends” in three successive years for com-
missioned rank, engineer-lieutenant.
* * * *
Such cases may be paralleled by the dozen.
The shore billets in the R.A.N. are held by
all sorts of marine anomalies. There is, for
example, a chief engine-room artificer who
was promoted to warrant rank when the
war began. He was appointed provision-
ally (which obviated the need for an exami-
nation), and the seagoing appointment
•which ordinarily follows such promotion was
dispensed with in his case. He stepped
straight into a shore job, and has held it
ever since, to the detriment of every sea-
going artificer-engineer desirous of such a
position. Incidentally, he is borne on the
seagoing or active-service list, though he
has never, in a sailoring sense, been to sea.
Without suggesting that these men have got
their jobs, or are holding them, by undue
influence, or anything like it, there still
remains the fact that they are advantaged
by being on the spot. The fighting sailor
is proportionately disadvantaged, inasmuch
as he is often many thousands of miles
away from it. The more the man on active
service abides by the regulations—that is to
say, the better-disciplined sailor he is—the
more he is handicapped. The fighting sailor
is stringently debarred from the use of poli-
tical influence as a means of redressing his
wrongs. The situation boils down, accord-
ingly, to this. The Empire has spent a lot
of money and many years training a number
of men for one of the most highly-technical
jobs in existence. They entered the R.A.N.
for the love of it, and they ask nothing better
than to stay in it. But they would not be
the men they are if they were content ivith
the prospect of remaining permanently in .a
backwater. Does the Commonwealth wish
its navy to offer a “blind alley profession”
to practically all but the 30 officers per year
who are turned out from Jervis Bay? If so,
the fleet must shortly lose a big batch of
seamen who are veterans in all bnt years;
and it will no longer attract —so far, any-
how, as the lower deck is concerned—the
type of man that a modern fleet most
requires. i__
THE DISHCLOTH.
When man got busy on the upward track
and left his tail and most of his hair behind
him, Nature felt very sore about it.' Ihs
offence was not only that he was so different
from other things, but that each of him was
so different from the rest that he actually
needed separate names and acted in as many
ways as there were individuals of him, to
the utter confusion of system and order.
For Nature is an orderly and precise old
person who detests variation from type, and
here was variation grown so flagrant ancl
general that she had to put on her spectacles
to find out which was the type, and even
then couldn’t be sure of it. No engineer
of hot-cross buns or architect of billiard-
balls ever tried so hard to get things
exactly alike as Nature. She would have
every leaf on the tree made on a pattern,
every flower of the same size, shape, color,
smell and texture. She grinds the pebbles
on the sea-shore for a million years to get
them uniform; and when she fails in that,
she goes on grinding till they are mere
mud, still with the hope that all variations
may be wiped out. Give her a rose-bush
that the nurseryman has developed to the
highest perfection of form and beauty, and
let her operate on it for 50 years. lne
exquisite shape and color which distin-
guished it from other roses will be gone. Its
children will be all of uniform type the
wild dog-rose from which the higher horti-
cultural forms have come. Rather than
have one apple better than another she
would take the whole race of apples back to
the crab ; rather than have nigger and white
man on her hands at the same time she would
lead humankind back to the forest and teach
its tail to grow as heretofore. Her thinking
is quite flat. She hates a mountain, and
does her best to pull it down. She hates
a valley, and tries to fill it up. The smooth
wordy purr of a daily-newspaper leading
article is divine irregularity compared with
her notion of things. * #
In all this the upward evolution of life
is wholly opposed to her. The primal cell
gave her a headache for a millennium ; and
when it went on and triumphed in spite of
her, she refused to yield her cherished con-
victions and strove without even a moment’s
pause to arrest progress and change. She
is the primeval Tory—the grand exponent
of the better-as-you-were policy. Man was
and is her chief abhorrence. Always he
is breaking out in a new place ; and in her
blind fury she links herself with the lower
forms whom she once detested in an effort
to dethrone him. In this she has a strong
ally'. In man himself there is an element
akin to the levelling spirit of Nature.
Though all man’s advances have been gained
by a breaking away from the rest, by the
doing of new things and the thinking of new
thoughts, by being an ass and sticking to
his folly or being a prophet and clinging to
his cali, yet the mass of men are as ’eager
to get flat as Nature is to make them so.
To do exactly 7 as others do is frequently
called accepting an ideal. Somebody
invented trousers, and ten million men would
rather risk the fires of Hell than go without
the proper creases in them. Somebody
thought of a picture show ; and within five
years half the world was trying to reduce
itself to sheer inanity by watching the
things as often as sixpence permitted. A
woman made herself disgusting by sticking
powdered chalk on her face and giving her
lips three coats of red tallow. Next year
thousands of women had their cheeks and
mouths dirtied in the same way. And so
it goes on. The thing one will do many
will do. The book one will read many will
read. However futile the publication may
be, let the publisher announce that a hun-
dred thousand have been sold and another
hundred thousand will swamp themselves in
it and try to pretend that they like it. Here
and there, of course, there is' the real indi-
vidualist who breaks a custom. At once
that thing .which man has in common with
Nature —the flat dishcloth end of his soul —
gets busy on the rebel. He is jeered at,
mocked and persecuted, possibly crucified.
Sometimes he holds on and succeeds; but his
success lies in the attempts of a subsequent
crowd of dishcloths to swab a new age into
conformity with his ideas of things which
have already grown old. The person who
gets out of line in the new age has the same
old treatment of jeer and mock and injury.
Yet it is those who refuse to conform who
lift the world to higher places; and in spite
of all the Toryism of Nature and man.
irregularity is the thing that wins whatever
may be worth the winning.
It is for this reason that uniformity is a
dangerous thing in our political field. The
binding creed of a party is always the dish-
cloth swabbing out progress. Where life
is real and abounding and strong the diversi-
ties are always the greatest. To agree-
ment at all points among advanced thinkers
is all but impossible; and the more ad-
vanced they are the less it is to be looked
for. Yet ever since England took on the
business of party government such agree-
ment has been looked for among the leaders
of a side, together with complete conformity
among the rank and file. Australia, with
a freer outlook and no reason at all for
doing so, made her political system a slavish
copy of that under which Britain stagnated :
and even now, whenever a change is pro-
posed, people who take their pblitical
thoughts ready made from anybody with a
loud voice will try to get out the dishcloth
and swab the discussion down to the ancient
flajtness. The present is a suitable time
for a revolt. Such a revolt must have
occurred in the history of primeval man to
give him the sudden lift forward above all
other animals which only diversity or
thought and action could have accomplished.


The end of the war marks the beginning
of a H-W era; and if wg suw the gie<it
calamity through for anything at all, it
should have been for freedom of thought.
Free thought means diversified thought.
Hope for the future becomes greatest when
every Jones is thoroughly at variance with
the opinions of every Smith and with every
other Jones also. The man who preludes
a political statement with I thoioughly
agree with you, my dear sir,” is a traitor
of the most dangerous kind. In a really
civilised State he would probably be put to
death as such: for the removal of the dish-
cloth is a moral act worth taking extreme
measures to accomolisk. Though we have
not yet risen to such splendid heights of
patriotism, this at least may be taken as
axiomatic: the conscription of thought by
party organisations of any color is the
essence of death. Old Nature watches it
and delights in it; for it means so swift a
retrogression that she can almost see the
tails returning and the last cell winking to
extinction where the first one thought for
itself and won.
THE MARSHALL ISLANDS.
[ FOR THE BULLETIN.]
President Wilson quite fails, and has
throughout the war quite failed, to Tightly
appraise the Japanese. In a recent utterance
he said he “could not see what the Japanese
could do with the Marshall Islands, as they
were neither commercially nor strategically
important.” It is quite possible lie docs
not know, and has no means -of knowing, .
what the Japanese are doing in Pm Mar-
shalls, the things they have accomplished
in the short space of four years, and the
splendid foundation they have laid for the
other things they mean to accomplish. The
Japanese are no laggards, no dreamers, no
wasters of time or of opportunity. They
are thoroughly Spartan-like in their ideas of
colonisation, and these qualities are produc-
ing the most startling results in commercial
activity, to say nothing of strategical advan-
tages.
The Marshalls are in a vast, little-
traversed solitude of the Pacific, and it is
not fair to such an energetic people to sup-
pose that they are sitting down twirling their
thumbs awaiting the decisions of the Peace
Conference as to what is going to be done
with the group. If President Wilson is
alive in ten years’ time, as it is to be hoped
he will be, he will then have learned an
appreciation for Japanese ability, for the
Central Pacific will be by that time a “New
Japan,” and there will radiate a Japanese
commerce through the whole of the
Pacific that will leave no room for any com-
mercial efforts from America. In ten years'
time the Pacific could be held, and firmly, by
the activity, the determination and the
cleverness of the Japanese as they are mani-
fested to-day in the one little group of the
Marshalls.
The natives, it is most apparent, consider
themselves and their future in Japanese
hands. They have adopted Japanese ideals
and customs, and the Japanese authorities
are worthy of all praise for the skilful and
diplomatic manner in which they have gone
to work to Nipponese their protegees. The
native kings and chiefs and their families
have all been taken to Japan by the authori-
ties to let them fully realise the greatness of
those that have come to rule over them and
assure their prosperity. The Marshalls
were taken over on terms of occupation simi-
lar to those by which the Australians are
holding German New Guinea; for these
islands were part of that territory, or at
least under its administration. The Aus-
tralians are administering German New
Guinea according to German law; that was
the agreement signed by General Holmes,
and approved by the British Government.
But in the Marshalls German law has given
place to Japanese regulations, full of promise
and progress. All German schools are
closed and all missions silent in all the
lagoons except Jaluit, and even there the
German Sacred Heart Mission and the
American (or Boston) Mission are inactive.
But there is a flourishing Japanese school,
under Japanese teachers, for the native chil-
dren gathered from all lagoons. The Jap-
anese tongue is compulsory. Japanese
customs tariffs have superseded German
tariffs, and all port and shipping dues are
Japanese. Japanese traders have stations in
nearly every lagoon, though regulations have
closed certain lagoons from the attentions of
any trader. Japanese goods, from needles
to anchors —preserved fruits and patent
medicines, sewing machines and bicycles,
sauces and lager beers, walking sticks and
gold watches, scents and pomades, boots and
clothes, all attractively produced—have
taken hold of the islanders. * The traders
have set out to acquire an intimate know-
ledge of the peculiarities of the Islands
trade, and have succeeded so as to allow
room for little competition. Four years
ago their trade in the Marshalls was not
worth a toothpick; to-day it commands the
whole of the group. For twenty-five years
Burns, Piiilp and- Co., the representatives
of Australian commerce, valiantly and
fairly fought the Germans for the
rights of trade; in less than four
years the Japanese have almost mopped
up the lot. Their trading vessels multiply,
and many more are building on the stocks
of Japan. These and other circumstances
prove the value the Japanese merchants put
upon the Marshalls and the harvest they
intend to reap.
The authorities at Jaluit, the capital, have
issued regulations to the natives, requiring
the planting up of waste and hurricane-
swent land within three years. This will
have the effect of more than doubling the
present output of copra, adding enormously
to the prosperity of the group in less than
10 years. The natives have been rather
flurried by the regulations, and have peti-
tioned that they be not - enforced, pleading
that there is not the labor to fulfil the con-
ditions. But they are hard at work to-day,
nevertheless, planting those waste lands.,
The Japanese give no encouragement 1o
idlers, and many of the natives already see
that this new energy will be for their own
good. The natives, too, understand that
new industries are to be started, financed by
far-seeing merchants of Japan, which will
eventually make them a people no longer to
be accounted “black barbarians without hopes
or ambitions.” Already many new uses
have been found for the products of the
cocoanut, and the Japanese share their
knowledge for the advantage of the Islands
people.
Every Japanese official and trader one
meets is fully impressed with the possi-
bilities of the islands of the Pacific, and
whatever claims Japan has will most cer-
tainly be pressed. She has come into the
Marshalls, and she is fully persuaded
that it is well worth while staying. For
the rest, the work her various agents have
accomplished is worthy of all praise; and
though the Islanders may feel the hardship
of being suddenly roused from their easy
and slothful ways, they find masters who do
not brutalise them as did the Germans, who
build them up in bodily health, and fit them
in strength and intelligence for the future
and its more strenuous endeavors.
I make no comment upon how all this
affects or may affect Australia. I simply
state the facts, a knowledge of which is
essential to any judgment upon the question
of Pacific control.

PLAIN ENGLISH.
Wire-netting. . . .Free.
A deputation which recently waited on N.
S. Wales Lands Minister Ashford had
something to say about the futility of stir-
ring the mould and planting a crop therein
when, for want of wire-netting, the rabbits
eat up the substance, and there is nothing
left. During the war wire-netting went up
to some 34 or more times the usual price, and
was scarce even at that, because little of
it could be imported, while the wheat it
should have protected went down because
little of it could be exported. A trme is
made locally, but the wages are high com-
pared with those in some competing coun-
tries, and the tariff contains the invariable
old item ■
Wire-netting. . . .Free.
So in addition to the ordinary competition
this is one of the few places where surplus
stocks can be dumped in slack times when
goods have to be realised even at a sacrifice.
It is the Cheap Autumn Sale country. Aus-
tralia could have supplied all the necessary
wire in war-time at little over one-third of
the imported cost, and alleviated in some
Slight degree the troubles that fell on agri-
culture ; but the Government refused to
amend the tariff, and people were reluctant
about investing a great pile of money in an
industry which would be killed as soon as
the war ended, if the One Big Union didn’t
confiscate it previously. The deputation
that spoke of rabbits and netting to Minister
Ashford wanted to know if a Government
factory couldn’t be established, seeing that
private manufacture was discouraged. And
Ashford replied, in the true Freetrade
spirit, that local manufacture is quite un-
necessary, for he believed that imported sup-
plies would soon be coming in—at the
suppliers’ price, of course. So the battered,
war-worn Allies, half of whose factories
have been burned or looted or turned into
munition works, are to get into their stride
again to supply the necessaries of life to
this country which didn’t lose a factory or
a machine in the great scrimmage or turn
even a cowshed into a munition-factory.
The same Allies are also expected to hurry
up and supply Australia with telephone-
wire, steel plates for building ships, with
entire ships, with railway rolling-stock,
wmollen-weaving machinery', and some hun-
dreds of other things which ran short during
the war and -sold by driblets at famine prices,
because Australia was too proud to depart
from its old occupations of wharf-lumping,
printing Government notes, and dealing in
land. Also, the Allies are expected to lend
un the money to pay for all these things, for
it is mentioned with satisfaction that the
loan business will look up magnificently now
that the world’s markets are open, and
money will simply pour in at 5§ or 6 per
cent. One of the importing papers, in fact,
thinks Europe might do still more: it re-
cently suggested that the Hun should be
called upon to pay “indirect damages” to
Australia because his war had seriously
retarded our industries. If there is one
bright spot on the Hun’s blood-blotted
record it is that he gave to big countries,
such as Australia, Japan, Canada and the
United States, which w r ere out of the devas-
tation zone, a supreme chance to get rich.
They had an opportunity to create new in-
dustries ; to supply at war-rates the markets
which Russia, Germany, Austria, France,
Belgium and Britain were too busy to sup-
ply ; to throw shoddy ships together in haste
and grab a carrying trade which sometimes
paid for the ship in a single voyage. Three
of them reached out for the chance and more
ihan paid their war expenses out of it; in
fact, the United States and Japan paid off
their foreign liabilities and became creditor
countries, with dividends coming .in. Aus-
tralia;-with E’reetraders striving to suppress
'its industries in the interests of importers,
and Bolsheviks putting every possible
obstacle in their way in the interests of
anarchy, built no ships, created no indus-
tries, and fell into such a state of decay that
it couldn’t even keep the rabbits out of its
crops for lack of foreign assistance. It has
no bill to present to the Hun for destruction
of industry. Logically the Hun should
rather send in a bill to Australia for the
opportunity he gave it. It isn’t his fault
that it was wasted.
The Mask.
From a well-known -aural surgeon :—-
There is no doubt that continual mask-wearing is
bad for those who are suffering from a deflected
nasal septum or an enlargement of the inferior
turbinal bones. The secretion will undoubtedly tend
to accumulate in' the many hiding-places of the nasal
cavities, and mai' cause acute or chronic deafness
by passing along the eustachian tifbes to the mucous
membrane of the middle ear. Childien with
adenoids and enlargement of the pharvngial tonsils
are to be pitied, as they are bound to have their
symptoms aggravated by the additional obstruction
to free respiration in the shape of masks. Many
persons who have nasal spurs and irregularities,
but have been free from catarrhal symptoms Owing
to the potency of their nostrils, may become subject
to chronic colds in the head from congestion and
inflammation of the nasal mucous membrane, due
to obstruction to the free entrance of air to the
nasal chambers.
The current of air is warmed in the nose, and
that is why mouth-breathing is so injurious in
children, and why colds are so freequent in mouth-
breathers. The air reaches the lungs without being
properly warmed. If the current of air is already
warmed by passing through four layers of gauze, it
cannot be conducive to health to have it warmed
a second time in the nasal chambers. The indi-
vidual would soon suffer from lassitude and wouldn’t
be fit for protracted physical or mental work.
It depends, then, upon the amount of breathing
space in the nostrils- whether a person with a nasal
irregularity is to be healthy or a victim to frequent
colds and their sequela. If masking is persisted
in much longer, the narrow-nosed patient will be
made much worse, and the one with plenty of nasal
room will soon become a victim to a catarrhal
process.
The Health authorities should remove the incon-
venience at the earliest possible moment consistent
with safety.
The 40-hour Week.
Melbourne Trades Hall Council has
recorded its opinion that the hours of labor
ought to be reduced to 40 per week. If it
stopped there the case would be arguable.
There is no special virtue in an eight-hour
day any more than there was in the old 10-
or 12-hour day. It is indeed a well-estab-
lished fact that more work is done now in
eight hours —or certainly more work was
done in eight hours —than was previously
done in ten. And a vast amount of evidence
coukl be got together in favor of a conten-
tion that more work could be done in 40
hours than in 48 or 44. Professor Kijnt,
in a report on “Industrial Fatigue,’’ follow-
ing an investigation made for the Munitions
Department, cited the case of a surgical-
dressing factory where women were engaged
as yarn-winders. Ten hours a day w r ere
worked, with two hours overtime. Some of
the employees protested that they could do
more work in eight hours 'than in twelve.
A test was made of four of the women. In
32 p.c. less hours 8 p.c. more work was
done. Further, when the overtime was cut
out, the length of the working-time being
thus reduced by 16 p.c., there was an
increase of 5 p.c. in the output. A test
made in trench-digging is quoted in another
report of the Ministry of Munitions -
The officer of one company allowed his men to
work uninterruptedly until their condition demanded
a rest. The officer of ths rival company divided his
men into three sections, of which each section suc-
cessively worked its utmost for five minutes and
rested for ten. This systematic arrangement resulted
in an easy win for his company.
Dr. Myers, Director of the. Psychological
Laboratory at Cambridge, quotes a case
partly analogous. This test was made in
connection with the operation of inspecting
bicycle-balls for flaws—work for which good
vision, good powers of observation and quick
reaction are essential: —
Pv rmot'wing only the most suitable workers 35
could do the work of the previous 120, their hours
were reduced from 101 to 84 per day, two days’
holiday were given per month, their wages were
increased by riearly 100 p.c. and the accuracy of
the work was increased by two-thirds.
It is because tests of this sort have produced
such results that there is a tremendous body
of opinion in Britain in favor of radical
reduction of working hours. Lord Lever
tiulme. one of the biggest employers of
labor in the world, wrote in the Times
(22/6/T8)
I think six hours at monotonous work is long
enough for any man or womap, and believe it
would be well for us if such a limit were adopted
in other than industrial occupatiohs. I would begin
with the factory, where a limitation of hours,
because of the tedium, is most necessary.... It is
a noteworthy fact, in the history of labor, that
the shortening of hours has meant not a decrease
but an increase in production. The successive
changes from 13 hours in the day to 12, and again
to 10, so resulted. Even more marked were the
results of the change to eight hours. Production
was augmented, loss of time from sickness and
inefficient handling of machinery was lessened.
Unfortunately, so many of those who profess
to speak for the workers want shorter
hours not in order to increase the output
but frankly to reduce it—in order, as they
put it, to “make the work go round.” This
is just as utterly wrong as the cruder N.S.W.
South Coast plan of limiting a piece-man’s
earnings to 12s. per day. Obviously the
more that men produce the more there is
for them to divide. They may not always
get what they do produce: it is their busi-
ness to try to get it. But nothing is surer
than that they cannot get more than they
produce. And the more they produce the
more it is possible for them to get. To
urge the 44- or even 40-hour week <pn the
ground that they will be able to produce
more, and so make it possible for them to get
more, is therefore understandable. To urge
it on the ground that they can be better off
by producing less is madness.
Slavery and Other Things.
This is a yarn about things in general:—
When the One Big Union organisers get down to
details, as they can’t avoid doing now and then,
the fact is usually admitted that the movement
stands for the repudiation of the public debt. It
can’t be otherwise, seeing that it proposes the aboli-
tion of capital, and money saved up and invested
in anything that yields interest, whether it is a
war-bond or a savings-bank deposit Or a life insur-
ance policy, is capital. Also the people who own
these things are capitalists, and therefore belong to
a class which must be reformed out of existence.
Likewise they are indirectly employers, in common
with the person who employs a domestic servant or
a nurse or a washerwoman (but not the person who
employs inflammatory language). In order to pre-
vent the creation of capitalists a widely-accepted
ptoposal is to the effect that all incomes above a
certain figure shall be confiscated by the State, and
£5OO is spoken of as the figure at which private
ownership should end. Consequently if the man
who draws a £2OOO prize in Tattersall’s sweep is
already earning £4 a week, £1916 of his winnings
will go to the State, and if he is earning only £3
a week the State will take £1656 of his winnings.
But the supreme trouble lies in the repudiation of
the public debt, which, of course, involves the
stoppage of all those banks (especially savings-banks,
which' are more heavily involved than ordinary
banks), assurance offices and other institutions which
have put much of their customers’ money into public
securities. If the new party secures a majority, then
a majority of people will know that the only chance
to save their savings is to get the money out early,
or to sell their policies back to the insurance society
promptly, and put the proceeds in the safest place
they can think of. Only a few of them will get
their money-—those who reach the spot before the
loose change gives out —and the rest will go shpil
But if the new party proposes to be a very small
minority overcoming the great majority by attack-
ing it suddenly with guns and axes and carving-
knives and clubs and securing power in that way.
then only a very few will know that the repudiation
is really coming, and they may secure and conceal
under the bed their own little bit of money before
everything stops and the shutters of industry are
put up.
A question about which there is less information
than might be expected is the future of the dispos-
sessed people. When all the “values’’ and “means of
production” belong to the trades-union class, which
is, after all, only about a tenth of the community
or perhaps a fourth of the capable adult population,
there must be an overwhelming pauper or slave-clas3
which owns nothing. It is absolutely necessary that
there should be such a slave-class, composed of all
who are now outside the Trades Hall orbit—
this for two reasons. One starts with the fact that
the private wealth of Australia, according to the
latest official estimates, is about £240 per head, or
£l2OO for a family of five, nearly half of it being
tin- (often artificial) values of land. If this was
confiscated and shared round equally without any of
the artificial values being destroyed in the scrim-
mage, a good deal would remain with the present
employing or capitalistic class. In fact, a very
huge number of them would have to receive in the
distribution instead of giving, for, taking N. S.
Wales as an example, about one-third of the fac-
tories employ the proprietor and less than two wage-
slaves. That kind of employer has seldom £240
per head of unencumbered assets to show, and if he
was taken into a general, national partnership some
of the better off among the insurgents might have to
subscribe to make up his share. A general division,
if it could be done without half the values disappear-
ing in the breakage and unsaleableness of things,
would leave a section of the unionists better off and
another section just where it is, while a few might
even lose. To make them all richer a large propor-
tion of the people must become helots.
And there is another good reason why slavery in
one form or another will be unavoidable under the
new regime. When an active and organised minor-
ity—possibly a very small one —secures power by
getting the majority down, it can only retain the
power by keeping the majority down. In a country
ruled by one-adult-one-vote, revolutionists must be
a minority; if they weren’t they would take control
in the ordinary way of business. If they went back
afterwards to the system of government by all the
people the first election would see their finish, and
then gaol would yawn for the leaders, and the
gallows might yawn later on. The establishment of
slavery is an awkward proposition, but a minority in
power, not being able to trust the people, has to
sit on the people.
The Digger and the Public.
After every big war, especially under vol-
untaryism, the returned .soldier is in danger
of becoming unpopular. Re-action sets in
almost as soon as the fighting stops. It is
a law of social dynamics, which applies to
all bodies of persons in the public eye, that,
after the pendulum of enthusiasm has
swung forward, it should swing back again.
How far it is going to swing back in the
case of the A.I.F. will depend on the men
themselves. It has hardly started to move
yet. The performances which supplied
the momentum are too great and too
recent. But this public is no different
from any other in history. It is fickle and
it is forgetful. And it is leavened by those
who have much to gain, in jobs and self-
justification, by discrediting the A.I.F. Con-
flicts on the part of the troops with consti-
tuted authority give the shirkers the chance
they want to point out smugly that the
Digger may be useful enough as a rough
soldier, but that as a citizen lie is hopeless.
Returning soldiers with something to lose,
either materially or in reputation, should
recall these points at the stage in the trip
home when the professional grievance-
monger mounts the soap-box to give his jaw
some practice. A row'is a diverting relaxa-
tion after a dull sea voyage—particularly
to those who foment it. But is it worth the
alienation of public sympathy which it cre-
ates? Is it a fair thing to the thousands
whose future will largely depend on the
sympathy of the public? Is it a fair thing
to “the lads who are coming after” —the
men in whose interests it is invariably
alleged that a fight has to be made ?

Simon Pure.
The Hun possesses a streak of humor; also,
he looks ahead. lie still demands, his
colonies back, but being certain that he
won't get them, and that his French. Polish
and Danish steals are lost, the new Presi-
dent declares that Germany
intends to base its policy, at home and abroad, on a
ireelv-exercised right of self-determination. We
cannot tolerate ouk brothers being robbed of their
freedom o' choice.
It is quite probable that, when affairs
simmer down, and it is fairly clear that the
Hohenzollerns are not coming back (until
the next opportunity), the small Ilun States
—and perhaps German Austria as well-
will gravitate towards the new centre. If
they don’t gravitate quite willingly, imper-
ceptible pressure may do it. Then there
will be a very big “self-determined” State in
Durope ranking with France, Spain and
ioland for size and far ahead of them in
population. When things cease to boil over
and Germany crawls into the League of
Aations, it will be the great-—the very great-
est—Simon Pure upholder of the cause of
nationalities that haven’t been self-deter-
mined, and among which there exists, or can
be manufactured, an agitation on the sub-
ject. These will include Irish. Boers, In-
dians, Burmese, Koreans, Javanese and Fili-
pinos; Tripolitans and Algerians and Tuni-


sians, all three taken from a feeble suzerain
who had previously upset the native Govern-
ments ; Moors and Persians, both recently
annexed formally or informally; Hawaiians,
etc. All these are peoples who formerly
had some recognised form of Administration
of their own, and sometimes a fairly capable
one. Some sort of case might also be made
about people who were sold for sordid cash
by one State to another—native Alaskans,
inhabitants of the Panama Zone and the
like. The Ilun, with his own paws clean by
necessity, will draw a sharp line between
countries like Germany, Poland, Bohemia,
Sweden, Norway, Spain, Serbia, Hungary,
Greece, Roumania and Bulgaria, which
don’t hold alien races in subjection, as
against the big aggressive races with foreign
property, and will get busy organising a
protest when its own misdeeds are partly
forgotten. A cementing influence will be
withdrawn when small peoples or small
political adventurers are no longer afraid to
set up for themselves lest the Hun should
eat them in their weakness and the end
should be worse than the beginning. The
fear of French conquest once made the 13
original States of George Washington’s
country cling to the Ma Country as the
lesser evil. The annexation of Canada in
1763 removed that old fear, and it took the
13 States just 13 years to decide that the
Ma Country was superfluous.
Accustoming People to Flout the Law.
A message from Auckland to the Austra-
lian papers:—•
At the Epidemic Commission Dr. Milson, repre-
senting the Auckland division of the British Medical
Association, said as a profession they thought that
tha wearing of masks was useless.
The Bulletin has had and still has every
desire to assist the N. S. Wales Health
Department. But the Department’s restric-
tions in many directions are having such
positive ill effects upon the community that
the community is at least entitled to know
the authority on which the Department
relies to justify its actions. We know for
certain that those actions are doing a vast
amount of harm; surely we are entitled ro
know who the medical men are who say that
the restrictions are certain to do a more
than counterbalancing amount of good.
Only here and there will a medical' man be
found courageous enough to put his unasked-
for views before the public. When he does
so he is told that he is a Bolshevik and an
enemy of order a_.d good government. That
might be so if the restrictions had been
drafted and approved by a body representa-
tive of the best medical opinion in the State.
But there is absolutely no p oof on that
point. And now we get from Maoriland,
where the profession has had great practical
experience, the assurance of the representa-
tive of the B.M.A. in Auckland that the local
medical view is that “the wearing of masks
is useless.” If it is useless, then it ought
not to be persisted in a day longer, because
there is at least general opinion that it may
be exceedingly harmful. The N.S.W.
Health Department must either justify itself
or withdraw. Apart from every other con-
sideration it is at present merely accustom-
ing people to think lightly of evading the
law. It is safe to say that not 40 p.c. of
the people carry out the masking regulations.
This cannot make for good government. Yet
we can hope for nothing better until the
Government takes steps to satisfy the public
that expert opinion is behind the regulations.
Military Courts for Civil Offences.
General Sellheim, the Commonwealth
Adjutant-General, announced last week that
tire Argyllshire men who broke out of the
Sydney Quarantine Ground are to be tried
by court-martial. In the daily press of the
same date appeared a statement made by the
Australian Prime Minister in London to the
effect that returning soldiers had the status
of civilians, and should, where possible, be
treated as such. The offence alleged against
the Argyllshire men was essentially a civil
one. And the chief of the men’s citizen
rights is a fair trial. It is doubtful whether
they wifi get it from any conceivable military
court convened in N. S. Wales. If these
men are to be tried as soldiers it is elemen-
tary justice, anyhow, that their case should
be handled by officials who have some under-
standing of their point of view. If they are
to be punished it is politic that they should
be able to respect the officials responsible.
Consider them. General Sellheim, who has
ordered the court-martial, was as near the
war as Cairo. His reviewing- officer is Mr.
Street, a non-combatant young barrister who
was only “called” after the war started.
General Lee, the N. S. Wales Commandant,
is a brave soldier, and one who has the
respect of the men, but he has not seen ser-
vice in this war. Wallace Browne, his
A.A.G., is a colonel who has not been to
war; and the same applies to the military
prosecutor*, Major Bowie Wilson, who in
civil life is a' mining-engineer. The men
know all these facts: it is only the public
which is unacquainted with them. Assume
—as under Pritish law it must be assumed——
that the accused are in a position to justify
their action. What chance have they, m
all the circumstances, of presenting then-
case to advantage? Assume that they are
convicted; and, through the legal incom-
petence of men who have had practically no
experience of evidence or procedure, wrongly
convicted. They are denied the right of
appeal, which every criminal or misdemean-
ant in civil life enjoys. The only faint
shadow of an Appeal Court, so far as they
are concerned, will be young Mr. Street, of
Sydney. If the Defence Department can t
realise the inadvisability of clinging to the
crude legal methods of the battlefield, in a
community which has not been within thou-
sands of miles of war, at least it should see
that these and other soldiers who may be
similarly treated get whatever medicine may
be coming to them from a Court which they
will respect. That is to say, a Court com-
posed not of men who are in reality mere
uniformed civilians, but one made up of dis-
tinguished fighting members of the A.1.F.,
hundreds of whom are already available in
every State. If the Commonwealth is doomed
to a period of Prussianism, let it be the least
exasperating and harmful sort of Prussian-
ism.
The Peace Conference, in its weak desire to
appease the rampant college professor from
the United States, de-
voted weeks to discussing
theories for the preven-
tion of future wars while
the present war raged
almost unheeded at its
doors. At recent advices
3000 badly-armed and
badly-clothed Polish sol-
diers were holding the
old Polish city of Lem-
berg, with the ther-
mometer 42 degrees below
freezing-point, against a
large force from the
Ukraine, to which the
Austrians, being out of
th 6 war themselves, had
surreptitiously lent ar-
tillery while the Confer-
ence wasn’t listening.
Wilson, the man who
never looked on war —•
Wilson with a clean
shave and a fresh biled
shirt every day and a
stove to warm his feet —
has a good many lives
to answer for. Like
Nero, he hypnotised the
fire-brigade with the
beauty of his music while
the city was burning.

THE GUARDIAN ANGEL.
“Marshal Hindenburg has issued a proclamation to
the German people, calling for national unity against
the new enemy, Bolshevism. He urges young volun-
teers and their comrades to remember that they are
all Germans, and show confidence in their leaders.”

aboriginal ponulation, which was never wiped
out like the aboriginal folk further _ north,
they are strong enough to occasionally
resent the heavy-father attitude of Wilson’s
country. Especially they have been alarmed
by the eating up of half Mexico, and by the
spread of the United States into Central
America and the West Indies and over to
the coast of Asia. Fifteen of them have a
sea-coast, and the new ambition of the U.S.
Government to have the strongest navy in
the world makes them fear that it may be
more of the heavy dad than ever. People
who are 100 years behind with their in-
formation point to them as a horrible exam-
ple of unrest. Yet the last big war in South
America finished 49 years ago. and there
has been only one medium-sized war since.
South America, in fact, is shockingly out of
training. Therefore the idea of being able
to carry its grievances, either internal or
against the bulky parent in North America,
to a tribunal largely composed of European
nations, will probably appeal to it.
Billjim made the pace in Blighty in 1918
and got married 2722 times in eight months.
That carried his English total along to 5626.
Samuel Hannah has just been given two
years’ hard for sandbagging Annie Perry at
Brisbane, and stealing £l6l. Samuel was
sentenced to death in 1905, but missed the
gallows, the sentence being commuted to
imprisonment for life. He was released
in 1917. Now he goes in again. A hard
man to warn is Samuel. .
“Umntu”: Percy Dargin, the Bathurst
(N.S.W.) man who was acquitted last
November in Capetown of murdering Denis
G. Granville, a fellow bank-clerk, is perhaps
the only present-day Australian who has
. been tried in a British country on a capital
charge without a jury. It was at bis own
request, and the plan was made possible by
a new law passed because of racial and
colored prejudices.
S. Aus. has an epidemic of Commissions ;
and nearly all of them are such light-weight
concerns that their conclusions don’t and
won’t command general acceptance. It has
had a couple to inquire into the doings of the
Wheat Pool —one to inquire into its man-
agement and the other into its mismanage-
ment. South Aus. has introduced many
reforms ; it may yet have two juries to try
a man —one to hear evidence for the prosecu-
tion and the other to listen to the best lies
the defence can think of.
Sydney Sun headlines :

This paper couldn’t be as nasty as that if
it tried.
The story runs in S. Aus. that fraudulent
means were adopted there to secure commis-
sion on War Loan subscriptions. Private
banks were not entitled to commission; but
in some instances, it is alleged, bank clerks
passed the applications on to brokers, who
affixed their rubber stamps, and were thus
able to obtain the ss. commission for each
£lOO, the spoil being afterwards divided
between the clerks and brokers. Two clerks
in two of Adelaide’s largest banks have been
asked to resign, and three firms of brokers
are alleged to be in the swindle.
“75”: In the Commonwealth Gazette
William Webster makes the. interesting an-
nouncement that the services of Royal
Reginald Charles Gordon William Meader
Williams, telegraph messenger on probation,
have been terminated. It is this attention
to detail which makes Webster a really Great
Administrator.
Although lack of shipping still limits the
activity of the gentle importer, goods from
abroad are pouring in. Customs receipts
for textiles and apparel—largely wool grown
in Australia and sent abroad to be made
into garments —amounted to £1,666,410 tor
the six months ended December last, com-
pared with £1,143.825 for the corresponding
period in 1917. The receipts from oils and
paints rose from £118.890 to £148,3'3;
earthenware from £54,571 to £134,664;
jewellery and fancy goods from £100,993 to
£165,584; vehicles from £153,017 to £163,098.
The appointment of Mrs. C. E. Maguire to
a seat among the City Parents of Auckland
in recognition of the splendid defence made
by Maoriland women against the ’flu recalls
the fact that 20 years ago the mayoral
rabbit-skin at Onehunga had to be cut sma 11
enough to fit a female wearer. The lady
was Mrs. Yates, who until six months ago
lived to enjoy the memory that she had a
hand in framing the by-laws of her own
town.
The Samoan correspondent of some Aus-
tralian dailies has been putting his view
of the proper future of that group: —•
None of the islands in this direction should come
under the flag of either Maoriland or the Common-
wealth, but Fiji, Tonga and Samoa, and some
others, ought to be confederated under one rule,
with the capital located in Suva.
And then they should go to the Dutch East
Indies for hundreds of thousands of Java-
nese to work.
Java, now under the rule of Holland, maintains
a superabundant population of many millions, and
great numbers could well be spared.
But nobody noticed Holland sending away
to some other country for laborers. Hol-
land developed the island with its own
labor; and as soon as the Dutch got the
population to work (at one time the
Javanese was no more inclined to work than
the Samoan), the millions began to improve
their position and increase amazingly.. The
idea of some wire-pullers in the Pacific
'lslands is to develop them for the benefit not
of the races that inhabit them, ibut of
foreign land-grabbers. It is a compliment
to Australia and M.L. that they are not
trusted to carry through the Hunnish
swindle.
Declaration by the youthful Corboy,
M.H.R., at Narrogin (W. Aus.) recently:—
Since he had been in the House he had found out
sufficient to prove that corruption was rampant; in
fact, the whole political element was corrupt, and
the people were being ruled by politicians.
Of course, he isn’t going to “prove” it, any
more than the Prohibition dervishes ever
give the name of the pub whence they see
children rolling forth under the influence of
liquor; but it shows what a lad of an
inquiring mind can find out within half an
hour of his first appearance in Parliament.
Victoria is going strong at the great art
of bribing small farmers to get off the land
that there may be room for returned sol-
diers, often less experienced men, to go on
the land with a healthy mortgage for com-
pany. During January 3831 acres were
acquired for £73,361, or rather over .£l9 per
acre. Eighteen separate lots went into the
3831 acres varying from 786 acres down to
11 acres. No violent breaking up of big
estates about that lot!
By “Henry Horsecollar,” shipbuilder:—
In future, according to big British constructors.
15,000 tons is to be the baby size in ships for
services like that to Australia. The full-grown
size will be almost anything. It means that, if
we stick to the old habits and devices, some ports
will have to be reconstructed at vast expense, to
admit these fancy whales, unless the said ports give
up their ambition to be in the full-blown category,
while some more will have to give up the ambition
in any case. Presently the States which were cut
out of the itinerary may become peeved, and waste
the substance they haven’t got in digging their
harbors deeper. The struggle to live up to another
person’s motor-car is expensive. The struggle to
cut a continent to the size of another person’s boat
is ruinous.. It would be different if there was any
finality about liners or any permanence either. But
the first airship is feeling its way towards Aus-
tralia, crawling at a mere 71 miles an hour, for the
road is new and the air-currents not properly charted,
and the stations not built yet, It is only an
ordinary sort of craft, doing gravel-train or con-
struction work, but vessels released from war service
are being fitted with promenade decks, sleeping
berths and state cabins. The builders may propose
to pile up baby ships of 15,000 tons and old-man
ships of 80,000 tons. That is their affair. By the
time the first one is ready this country may be in
a position to send a brief airgram: “Keep the
dropsy to yourselves. We are leading a new life.’
Russian saying:—
The Germans know everything; they probably
even discovered the ape.
No doubt they did. And on him founded
their Kultur. ‘ Observe the way they climb
down, spitting and showing their teeth all
the way.
“Gleniris” : Advts. have been put in the
Melbourne dailies by the prohibitionists,
quoting U.S. medical authorities as to the
uselessness of alcohol in the present fight.
Dr. Robertson, chairman of the Board of
Health, has also expressed his hostility, and
the State’s medical advisory committee has
submitted its opinion to the effect that
“alcohol is neither a preventive nor an anti-
dote of influenza.” These are sweeping
generalisations, and about as convincing .as
hot winds. A well-known medical official,
with an intimate experience of flumonia, has
publicly recommended an alcohol gargle ol
lioz. daily, taken in occasional spoonfuls,
as a throat-cleanser; and, on the very day
when Dr. Robertson was throwing alcohol
out of the dispensary, another brass plate
o<= the highest qualifications told me how he
had pulled through a depressed girl-patient
who would most certainly have died of the
’flu witfiout the treatment given—a “perkmg-
up” teaspoonful of brandy every half-hour
during the critical period.

SUNDRY SHOWS.
Randolph Bedford in reply :
“J.A.” (B. 13/2/T9) misrepresents like a can-
vasser. The question is not of my equipment as
defender of the Ryan Government, but of “J.A.”
repeating stale lies against that Government. His
last sentence carries its own refutation as to 10 per
cent, of population being served by State shops:
“The remaining 90 per cent, not only get no benefit
from the State shops but are actually injured by
their existence, as a number of butchers in all parts
of Queensland, fearing State competition, have gone
out of business.” That looks the lie it is. Ninety
per cent, of the people get no benefit from State
shops; yet they are such serious competition as io
frighten butchers out of business in “all parts of
Queensland.” Here are the facts. There are 2S
State shops supplying 15,000 customers a day,
representing probably 80,000 people. The shops
are being extended as quickly as possible, and the
amount to be spent on new stations to supply them
will be roughly £2,000,000. State shop sales for
1917 were £272,957, and total profits since the first
shop was opened £59,570. On a low valuation
of State cattle —£4 13s. a head —the Auditor-
General gives a net profit of £113,239 on State
stations ; and 126,467 cattle are on hand. Attempts
are made to rig the stock markets, but the entrance
of State cattle to the sales blocks the attempts. The
saving to the purchasing private butcher works out
at an average of £3 6s. 9d. per 7001 b. bullock.
The State stations and State meat-shops scheme is
being extended to serve over 300,000 people, and the
full operation of that business means a capital invest-
ment of '£2,000,000. No matter what our oppo-
nents say, the Government handling of our meat and
insurance has cut the cost to the consumer in halves.
Another genius of the calibre of “J.A.” shrieks in
Maoriland that Queensland is “drifting to Bolshev-
ism.” The people of the South who pay 14d. to
15d. for rumpsteak while the Queensland State shops
charge 74d., greatly desire to get into the drift of
that current.
“Helersy” writes another act of a tragedy:
John Frederick Baker, the big-hearted Yic. busli-
man who tramped over the fiery mountains in spite of
a shattered arm and got to hospital at last (B.
13/2/’l9), has probably been told the news by now.
His brave old wife, who was left at home, alone,
to carry on while he was in hospital, has met her
death while he was away. The driver of. Sparks's
coach, travelling from McVeigh’s to Woods Point,
found her lying on the side of the road about 11
miles from McVeigh’s arid seven miles from her
home. She was alive, but her clothes were saturated
with rain, her speech incoherent, and she died on the
No. 1. —It was gratifying' to note the avidity with
which these simple savages devoured the glad tidings
that fell from the new missionary's inspired lips.
No. 2. —But it is not quite so gratifying to record the
avidity with which they afterwards devoured the new
missionary himself after chasing him all round the
island, to make him tender.
THE HEATHEN IN HIS BLINDNESS.
coach. On arrival at the old home, the place was
found to have been swept by fire. Absolutely nothing
remained but a blackened mass. Even the dog had
been burnt to death on his chain. Three years
ago a friend and I passed there on horseback, and
had it not been for the kindness of the old soul
we would have had a long and hungry ride to Mat-
lock. Mrs. Baker told us how they had been burnt
out years before, and, to use her own words, “lost
every mortal thing.” For awhile they lived near
Warburton, but had to buy firewood. So they got
back to the bush again, and there they remained
until the double tragedy of the last few weeks.
A fortnight after appointing a com-
paratively recent arrival from Scotland to
the job of Crown Prosecutor, the Law-
son-McPherson-Hutchinson-Kendell-McWhae-
CampbelJ Government has given the Chief
Police Commissionership to another Cale-
donian, George Steward, official sec. to the
G-G. _ For comfortable Government billets
in Victoria nowadays no Australian need
apply.
From Marie Bashkirtseff’s diary—she
wrote this in 1STG:—
When the day comes that these simple people,
deceived and roused, rise in revolution... .the result
will be perfectly awful. For if the Russians are as
gentle and obedient as sheep in times of peace and
quietness, when they do rise they will be raving
maniacs, demons of cruelty.
One thing is sure—whether the latest cabled
story about the Bolshevik policy in relation
to women is true or not. we needn’t doubt
anything that comes from Russia just
because it isn’t understandable.
Of a Melbourne art show:—
Miss Frances Hodgkins, row exhibiting her pic-
tures at the Fine Art Society, is fettered to an
impressionism that makes a brick an apparition and
reduces the burliest policeman to the shadow of a
shade. In the most ambitious example of her
style, “The White Kitten,” the animal's eyes and a
green lamp-shade are the central facts of a pris-
matic paroxysm wherein a dim lady with gangrenous
shoulders evinces the most retiring disposition. In
fact, she retires almost out of sight with a stick
of celery and the pepper-box, or whatever they are,
heading a general retreat on the table behind. “In
a Conservatory” and “The Tea Party” are alike
devoid of arresting information. Probably they
will make the average spectator suspect his eyesight
and hurriedly invest in a pair of spectacles. If
Miss Hodgkins reveals any particular preference, it
is for a vague beetle-browed kid of her own inven-
tion. Many of these she indicates impressionisti-
cally in clamant colors. Color, after all, is her
main enthusiasm. Give her yellow, red and blue
to play with, and she is as productive of surprise
as a baby with a tin of jam. Yet behind all the
extravagance and audacity of her methods, there is
evidence of the highest artistic competence, rein-
forced by a sense of beauty and harmony that
remains uncorrupted by the fastest French schools.
It is only necessary to note her charming set of
Lantern Dancers at Mardi Gras to understand that
Frances Hodgkins is most winning when she is most
herself.
“Eff Bee”: Randolph Bedford (B. 6/2/’l9)
is out of it when he says “the Government
controls meat and fish, and these are
cheaper.'’ They may be cheap in Brisbane,
but I live in Mackay. Before 1914 meat and
fish were about half the price they are now.
Some 1919 prices: Beefsteak, lOd. lb.; rump-
steak, lid.; fillet, Is. 2d.; rib-roast. Sd.; mut-
ton (other than chops), lid.; all round, Is.
lb. Before 1914 I used to get shoulder mut-
ton at 6d. lb., arid fish at 3d. Fish is now
Bd. lb. I wish Bedford supplied cheap meat
and fish instead of shoddy arguments.
“ J.G.”: The Preferential Voting Act is
giving the Vic. Nationalist members of the
Australian Parliament an uneasy feeling that
what was passed to counter the Labor party
may work another way. The Swan (W.A.)
election showed that the Farmers’ Union
was stronger there than they thought, and
in the Corangamite (Vic.) election the F.U.
beat the Nationalist man, although the latter
had the Government behind him. At the
next election it is quite possible for the Farm-
ers’ Union to capture a lot of country seats
now held by the Nationalists. .Towett
(Grampians), Leckie (Indi), Lister (Corio)
and Palmer (Echuca) may all be thrown out,
and Sampson (VVimmera), Rodgers (Wan-
non) and Wise (Gippsland) will have their
work cut out to retain their seats. If the
same thing happens in the other States, the
Nationalist party will be smashed by an Act
of its own making.
Maoriland lost its leading birdman the
other day, when W. C. Hill, head of the
Flying School at Christchurch, took the Last
Hive. He was up 2000 ft. over Riccarton,
testing anew set of wings and, incidentally,
taking the opportunity to thrill a big crowd
of racegoers with a few of his pet circus
tricks, when one set of wings collapsed. Hill
was diving to loop the loop at the time and
the result was a fall of 2000 ft., a pile of
matchwood and a dead aviator. Hill was
an Englishman who learned to fly at Hendon
before the war.
THE LARK HILL COMICS.
[ FOR THE BULLETIN.]
No better show on the purely humorous side
was staged by the A.I.F. than Camp 500,
Lark Hill, in its palmy days. Lieut.-Col.
Howl was the C.O. and his adjutant was
Lieut. Dreadnought. Conceive the C.O. as a
choleric ex-sergeant of British cavalry, with
immense feet —as bloodthirsty a little warrior,
so far as appearances were concerned, as ever
devoted 47 years of strenuous life to peace-
soldiering. He was strong on Discipline,
and gave a daily imitation of an English
n.c.o. of the Crimean epoch. His adjutant
was a fine, soldierly young fellow, who had
put in a few weeks in a quiet sector when
the A.I.F. first went to France, and who
had then developed a mysterious trouble
which, while leaving him sound in wind,
limb and appetite, rendered him unfit for
anything but Home Service. The halt,
the maimed and the gassed trooped through
Camp 500 on their way back to the firing-
line ; also deaf men, men with double-
strength glasses, and men with left or
right eyes missing as the case might be.
But Mr. Dreadnought stayed on.
The star feature of Camp 500, the thing
that gave it its wide-flung name of being
the most priceless vaudeville show in Wilt-
shire, was the 9.30 a.m. parade. Imperial
officers used to ride in from outlying parts,
sacrificing their breakfasts, in order to view
ir. The only ones who failed to catch the
full flavor of the joke were the rank and
fie of the performers.
It is a winter’s morning. The black mud
>f the parade-ground, frozen overnight, has
icon thawing for an hour beneath a grey
drizzle of rain. On the verandah outside
he orderly-room hangs a railway sleeper. A
member of the guard shudders out and
smites it nine times with a piece of iron.
It is the signal for the whole camp to get
On the move. There are 1500 officers and
men. in it, and they converge, marching in
sections and half-sections, from every point
of the compass. At wide intervals' across
the sea of mud are the “markers.” On a
dais is the band. Opposite the different
units stand the officers, and as Camp 500 is,
amongst other things, a sort of hospital
clearing-house, there.are plenty of them. If
they are new to the camp they wear a
slightly dazed look; in the case of field-offi-
cers the expression suggests helpless fury.
Away to a flank is the orderly-officer
‘dressing” the markers and frenziedly sig-
nalling to the buglers to make ready to
Wow the “Fall in.” In front of all stands
Mr. Dreadnought, looking every inch the
daredevil character which in point of fact
he is not. By his side is the Regimental
an elderly English ex-regular, who is
after what is known as “an Aussie.” His
tactics take the form of dramatic imperti-
nences to those in high places.
Across the mud strides a remarkable fig-
ure. It is the C.O. His boots resemble
those worn by a deep-sea diver. In his
right hand he clutches the sort of huge
stick which is rarely seen outside panto-
mime. I-lis “British warm” only reaches
an inch or so below the small of his back,
lhere is anger on his brow, and Mr. Dread-
nought hurries forward to allay it. Orders
are given to the accompaniment of violent
stick-waving. (Colonel Howl, by the way,
could put more expression into the conduct
of a bludgeon than any man I ever saw.) In
two seconds the whole parade is “double-
marking time.” Soldiers and n.c.o.’s, lieu-
tenants and captains, majors, with and with-
out decorations—all bound insanely up and
down in the mud. The C.O. gazes bitterly
on the scene. His vast right foot faces it;
his left forms a complete right angle with
the other. He leans slightly forward, rest-
ing upon Ins stick. In his left hand is a
cigar. Mistur Rerrednought!” lie bellows,
lhe adjutant salutes convulsively.
“A berr-luddy rabbil!” and tjie sapling is
pointed abhorrently at the leaping army.
Yessir,” agrees the adjutant eagerly'.
A berr-luddy”
“Excuse me, sir.” says the suave Cockney
voice of the R.S.M.
“And what ther Leill may you want’”
“Excuse me, sir, but it’s' strickly agynst
Kings reggerlations fer any officer or man
ter smoke on paryde.”
Violent movements of the stick, expressive
of stupefaction.
“And who ther berr-luddy heill may you
be, sir, to teach me manners?”
“Beg pardon, sir, but it’s the R.S.M.’s
duty ter call erttention to infractions of the
King’s reggerlations vJieresohevev and by
’oomsohever committed.”
It is a woodener. Mr. Dreadnought reels
and gives palpably at the knees. Providen-
tially the first notes of the “Fall in” sound.
(It may be noted here that the C.O. never
again smoked on parade, and'that his atti-
tude of the R.S.M. remained as friendly as
before. With all his faults he was an old
sportsman, and as such incapable of bearing
malice.)
On the last notes of the bugles the band
blares out; martial shouts issue from the
officers; and the men march, by units, up
to the “markers” and stand to attention. It
is the C.O.’s golden hour.
“Fall out, the officers,” cries the adjutant.
They line up before their leader. He
intimates that the whole Australian army
is a “rabbil” —more particularly the part
with which he has the misfortune to be con-
nected. He says that the parade is a -.
and the officers .
In the midst of a dissertation on the
worthlessness of Australians as soldiers, the
hated v:>ice of the R.S.M. is heard.
“Beg parding, sir, but they can fight all
right.”
“I don’t know so much about that,” howls
the G. 0., who has a fatal inability to resist
argument. Like a flash comes the cruel re-
tor:.
“No, sir, you’ve never ’ad the privilege uv
seein ’ ’em.”
“Ter heill wi’ yer.” howls the C. 0., rnd
the controversy lapses.
The C.O. was one of those men who aim
at the terrible and only achieve the prepos-
terous. It is hard to say what the adjutant
was aiming at. Anyhow, he managed to
stay at Lark Hill till the end, and reap
the 0.8. E., with which all Home Service
adjutants of two years standing and up-
wards were rationed. They never meant
it, probably, but between them they made
the place unbelievably unpopular. It was
about the only camp in England from which
98 per cent, of the inmates were struggling
all the time to escape—back to France. The
administrative staff claimed that the dis-
ciplinary goods supplied were of the real
old English brand. And yet Imperial offi-
cers, who knew the camp, used to well-nigh
burst with rage when they heard of it. But
at the worst the place appealed to every
Digger with a sense of humor. There are
Rabelaisian legends of Camp 500 which will
last longer than the youngest living member
of the A.I.F.

That makes the statutory standard 8 p.c.
for the year—3s p.c. in the first and 4+ p.c.
in the second half. Under the amending
Act of last year a Commission was appointed
to say what increase there had been in the
cost of production and distribution since
1912. His Honor found that it totalled
Is. 2d. per 1000 ft.; and as the standard
was fixed at 3s. 6d. in 1912, the new author-
ised price was 4s. Bd. There was some-
thing so wrong with this that the co. didn’t
seriously ask to be allowed to charge it; 4s.
sd. was agreed upon between Government
and co., and even at this rate, after writing
off no less than £60,602 for “special pur-
poses and depreciation,” as the benevolent
Act allows, there was an excess profit of
£21,729. The directors promptly reduced
the price another Id. It seems to offer
further evidence that the Commission’s
methods were all wrong.
As mentioned just now no less than
£60,602 was written off profits during the
half- year and transferred to a special reserve
account. The following exhibits the pro-
ceedings better: —
Dec., ’l7. June, ’lB. Dec., ’lB.

Less written off . . 60,256 36,308 60,602
Gross profit .. £26,341 £60,286 £90,579
The improvement in the working profit
shows the extent of the service rendered to
the gas cos. by the amending Act. With a
four-and-eightpenny standard rate the co.
could of course pay more than S p.c. But
is isn’t safe to depend upon the co. ever
being permitted to pay much if any more
than 8 p.c. Parliament has got into the
habit of regulating the price of gas ; and it
is safest to assume that it will not permit a
price to be charged that will at any time
give a dividend much in excess of 8 p.c. The
tendency will be rather to cut even that
down.
Certainly the position has been very much
improved during the last year or two by the
enhanced prices got for residuals. Look at
these figures :—•
Half-year ending

Gas .. .. £390,902 £396,107 £478,215

Management .. 1Q.717 11,322 13,421
Renewals . . 78,989 .67,465 90,894
Gas revenue has in two years increased
about 23 p.c.; revenue from residuals, 60 p.c.
It is a pity that the co. should be restricted
to 8 p.c. so far as residuals are concerned.
There is a tremendous field for industry in
lw-products; and the co. ought to be encour-
aged to go ahead. At present it gets no
encouragement at all. It need not worry
about by-products; if it doesn’t worsy it can
have things made right for it, if necessary,
by an increase in the price of gas. The two
things ought lo be kept separate.
On December 31 the co. still owed
£435,909 on temporary loans. This co., like
a good many others, decided to get in while
the going was good, and offered 50.000
shares. In conformity with the Act they had to
be offered to the public at auction. Jack Fitz-
gerald’s ’flu regulations probably interfered
with the success of the sale ; anyway, only
15.000 of the 50,000 were sold, at prices
ranging from £6 7s. 6d. to £G 3s. The
people who handle share investments pro-
fessionally were naturally not much inter-
ested in seeing that this new . idea was a
success.

The paid capital is only £50,000; but there
is £200,000 uncalled for the protection of
clients. The risks of a trustee co. are
threefold: (1) the chance that it may do
something which the trust doesn’t empower
if. to do, and lose a client’s money in the
process; (2) the loss of a client’s money
(or its own) by the dishonesty of an em-
ployee; and (3) the loss of its own funds by
bad investments. As to (1), if the Equity
takes the wrong turning it won’t be for want
of legal light. Three of the five directors are
leaders of the Bar —E. F. Mitchell, Stewart
McArthur and ex-Attorney-General Mac-
kinnon; the others are commercial men. As
to (2), fidelity bonds no doubt give any pro-
tection that close supervision can’t com-
mand. And as to (3) —well, £46,023 of
the funds is in public securities and £15,962
in the co.’s Queen-street premises purchased
many years ago. So, practically, the risks
are not serious. In view of that, and
especially of the way in which the bulk of
the funds are invested, the profit is very
dazzling. Even on the present capital of
£50,000, half of which was paid up out of
accumulated profits in 1916, they have aver-
aged over 17 p.c. p.a. for the past five years.
In 10 years, while an opulent dividend has
been maintained, the cash position has im-
proved as follows :
Dec.,’oB. June,’lB. Dec.,’lB.
Liquid assets.. £26,351 £47,410 £47,124
Other assets ... 24,478 32,065 32,769
Liabilities .. 98 Nil Nil
That makes £29,162 to the good in 10 years
—more than the total amount of the capital
actually paid by shareholders. There are
not many concerns that can do things like
that. And the prospect is still very rosy,
although the State is likely to push further
into this business.

There is a plant renewal and contingency
account, £40.000; general reserve, £8000;
undivided profit, £956; total, £48,956. Less
the paper asset mentioned above, £15,000.
Total more or less tangible reserves, £33,956.
But this paper wouldn’t care to swear that
the co. has tangible assets really worth
£33.956 more than the capital; for of the
capital of £112,500 no less than £104,010 is
represented by plant, mains and expenses of
installation at cost. It is a case in which
it is far less important to consider assets
than earning-power; and this comparison
shows the progress from the latter point of
view:—-

The management has had much more punch
during the past five years; in particular_it
has pushed the lift maintenance and repairs
business, and it hasn’t confined itself to
hydraulic lifts either. The result of it all
seems to be that the dry rot has been
stopped and the decay of profits arrested.
Apart from the undertaking the co. has no
assets to speak of; still it is not going
back: —

Liabilities 1292 4,533 3,279
Excess assets .. ..£8683 £8,053 £11,604
Meantime it lias paid for some extensions ot
mains, etc., and has kept the lot in repair.
It looks much better than it did during some
of the period when 10 p.c. dividends were
being pa’d—in days when maintenance didn’t
cost as much as it does now.

That’s a heavy bump in a bumpy table.
Actually, however, the working profit (after
deducting something for etceteras) was
greater than in the previous year: £30,950,
as compared with £25,081 in 1917 ; £55,848
in 1916; and £66,748 in 1915. But from
the past year’s profits £15,000 has been
clipped to put into a reserve for land and
income taxes. What was allowed for de-
preciation, etc., is not stated —the £1534
shown as written off in the table has come
out of a renewals and replacements reserve.
Still, there is no evidence to show that the
co. has had a very fat year; and even with
the ordinary div. reduced a point reserves
have had to be cut into to meet the distri-
bution to shareholders.
The abnormal conditions—shortage of
shipping, Imperial purchase schemes, etc. —
have made some big alterations in the bal-
ance-sheet figures. In 1914 the liabilities
and assets each totalled £360,391 ; last year
the figures had expanded to £901,722. With
the stock figures for 1918 are included pay-
ments on behalf of the British Government,
while the liabilities include advances of
£452,685 from the same source. Here are
the grouped figures :
1908. 1914. 1917. 1918.
Liabilities ..£149,255 £83,633 £194,352 £520,045
Works and fixed
assets .. 282,654 270,189 281,211 310,688

Book debts, etc. 56,283 43,195 163,925 57,569
Since 1908 £28,773 of new capital has been
got in and liabilities have leaped £370,790.
During the same period £501,960 has been
added to assets apart from works and other
fixed assets. So, besides extending the old
works and purchasing new properties out
of profits, the co. has also been able to pile

The finger-prints of the Maoriland tax-col-
lector are clearly seen on this co.’s accounts.
In 1913 £569 was paid in land and income
taxes; last year the contribution was
£3285. So though in the five years earnings
increased from £11,050 to £12,303, while
management exes. have climbed only
£l5O, there is now over £2OOO less available
for reserves after paying the 10 p.c. div.
However, in proportion to the paid-up capi-
tal the management has accumulated very
substantial reserves —capital, £60,000 (12,000
£lO shares paid to £5) ; reserves, after pay-
ing the div., £78,187. Though the 10 p.c.
to shareholders looks handsome, they are
really getting under 4J p.c. p.a. on their
funds.
The Equitable Board was not appalled by
possible post-war troubles, and continued
to increase its advances:—

Everything has worked out well so far. Pos-
sibly the future is all right, too ; but, with a
crushing war bill to meet, conditions have
entirely changed in the past four years. The
capacity of the co.’s clients to repay everv
penny of the £271,000-odd depends 'a good
deal on the markets for M.L. products and
on the management of the country by the
politicians. With a lot of depreciated pro-
perty thrown on its hands the co. might
suddenly discover a sea of trouble —particu-
larly if a big wad of the £265,000 of deposits
should be called for during the disturbance.
But the depositors should have no cause
to worry concerning the security for their
money. There are £365,459 of advances and
premises with a book value of £9400 to
meet £233,671 of liabilities not represented
by liquid assets.
Marcus Clark’s are capitalising some of
their undivided profits. Present capital is
£350,000. This will be doubled; but at
present only 175,000 new shares will be
issued, paid up to 10s. out of the reserves.
They will be 74 p.c. cumulative preference.
Present shareholders will get one of the new
issue for every two of the old.

Adelaide Gas Co. is not worrying, about
the rivalry of electric light. It recently got
shareholders to authorise a £50,000 loan for
extensions. The co.’s old capital of £250,000
was all called up long before a new Act m
1912 increased it to £500,000. This gave
them scope for a little while, but the big
suburban extensions have used it all up.
The co. has power to borrow an amount
equal to its called-up capital, and the amount
just agreed to makes £200,000.

Shareholders didn’t carry a vote of thanks to
Mr. Hughes, though it would have been only
a fair thing ; for it was his “settlement” of
the dispute in 1017 which laid the founda-
tions for the past year’s profit in spite of
the restricted market. Since the end of
1015, when the co. began to develop its new
property—the Felton —at Maitland, prin-
cipal balance-sheet figures have moved as
follows: —•
1915. 1917. 1918.
Liabilities . . £22,622 £33,093 £36,641
Fixed assets . . 230,682 261,435 279,098
Liquid assets . . 59,056 51,016 53,043
Liquid assets are thus £10,402 in excess of
liabilities now, as against £17,323 in 1917,
and £30,434 in 3915. So during 193 S the
co., besides passing out £12,500 in divs.,
managed to pay for the year’s development,
etc., of the Pelton, except as to £921. And,
while keeping the dividends going, the co.
has paid for development from first to last,
including railway construction, out of cur-
rent revenue, except as to £20,032. No
doubt if has got some little assistance from
the sale of surface land at Wallsend. The
record isn’t at all bad. In fact, the past
year’s experience has been almost gaudy for
an Australian coal-mining .concern. The
question, however, arises whether a co. is
wise in providing for what is strictly capital
outlay out of current revenue. There is
always the temptation, no doubt, to sock
away profits in extra-good times; but a co.
generally suffers for it in the long run; and
is likely to suffer still more. It becomes
more than ever clear that capital ought
to bear as close a relation to the true capital
outlay as possible.

Mt. Morgan had a narrow escape last
week. Hughes and his friend Higgins hav-
ing made such an appalling mess of “the
settlement of the metal problem” so far as
copper is concerned, Mt. Morgan doesn’t
know where it stands, and is piling up metal
to sell it doesn’t know when at a price
that it can’t guess at. The directors lately
announced that they would try to keep going
as long as the business could be financed ;
but they asked for the co-operation of
employees. Evidently, however, some em-
ployees don’t value their jobs, because last
week, resenting a rearrangement of offices
following on the return of a soldier, 300 men
knocked off work in the concentrating mill.
Thereupon a notice was posted that the co.
would have to close all the works on Monday
unless the mill-hands returned. They had
a meeting and decided to go back “pending a
settlement of the dispute.”
There should never have been a strike over
such a matter; and the incident ought to
again attract attention to some such plan as
that proposed by the Whitley Committee in
England. In 1916 the British Government

appointed this Committee —presided over by
Whitley, Deputy-Speaker of the House of
Commons—to give constant attention to the
subject of reconstruction after the war. Its
idea is to have “joint standing industrial
councils, composed of representatives of
employers and employees,” with “works com-
mittees representative of the management
and of the workers in particular works.”
These bodies would have numerous func-
tions ; but they would particularly deal with
such questions as that which has just dis-
turbed Mt. Morgan. In the words of the
N.S.W. Board of Trade, which has issued
two pamphlets advocating some such scheme:
The purpose of a Works Committee is to estab-
lish and maintain a system of friendly co-operation
and discussion between employers and employees on
all of the many questions affecting- daily life and
comfort, the success of the business and the effici-
ciency of working.
The committees would not in any way be
opposed to the unions. They would assist
the unions by removing the causes of strikes
and lock-outs —and, more, the causes of that
feeling of rancor which results in lazy
strikes. In the words of the British Gov-
ernment’s Committee: “Problems old and
new will find their solution in a frank part-
nership of knowledge, experience and good-
will.”
* * * *
General-manager Boyd told Arbitration
Judge McCawley that the best —-in fact, the
only—offer Mt. Morgan had received for its
current output of copper was £67 per ton!
This column’s analysis of Morgan's latest
accounts showed that costs had been about
£BO per ton. The Judge turned the dis-
gruntled men down hard.
Chillagoe (Q.) is likely to re-open with
Horsburgh back as metallurgist; with the
railway carrying for from 30 to 40 p.c. less
than the old Chillagoe rates ; and with smelt-
ing costs lower. Certainly they ought to
be lower, because Chillagoe’s fearful and
wonderful finance is ended, and there is no
hot air to earn interest for; because the Gov-
ernment has to earn with the smelters only
debenture interest and depreciation on the
very low cost; and because between the figure
for southern coke and that for coke from Mt.
Mullivan there should be a margin for ore
suppliers. Had smelting costs been Bs. a
ton lower, Mungana could have paid divi-
dends from the quarter of a million tons
smelted. It was the king-pin of Chillagoe,
because, although the Chillagoe co. itself
owned a lot of big tonnages of basic ore, many
of them were so low as to be little more than
ideal fluxes carrying a little copper, silver
and lead. Mungana had a bad beginning—-
tied to the tail of Chillagoe, which was a
prodigal financier, greedy of vendors’ plun-
der, and building its works on mortgagees’
money. For instance, the £600,000 of de-
bentures : Chillagoe got only £450,000 in
real money, the balance being underwriters’
commission, etc. But the ore smelted had
to carry the load of £600,000. When Mun-
gana shut down, according to engineers’ evi-
dence before the Select Committee, there
were in the Jane mine 50,000 tons worth
3 p.c. copper, 27 p.c. lead and lOoz. silver,
and in the Girofla 107,000 tons worth 5 p.c.
copper and 15oz. silver. The old co. started
off with £40,000 working capital, and found
£40,000 for development of ore, £30,000 for
London and Melbourne directorates and staffs,
and £50,000 for plant. The Government has
paid £701,000 for the railways, which the
State railway engineers say would cost
£1,150,000 to build to-day, and has smelters,
stores and plant and mines (including Einas-
leigh, to be worked as a State mine) thrown
in. In addition, £90,000 has been advanced
to Mulligan—which ensures cheap coal and
coke. The State has thus £791,000 in the
business. Minister for Mines Jones’s pro-
posal to work with co-operative parties those
mines which the Government owns, but which
the Leg. Council amendments prevent it from
working, may administer an effective kick
to 1.W.W.-ism in the North. Men working
co-operatively will be the pick of the miners,
with the incompetent and the lazy-striker
propelled per boot towards Biboohra.
Under the influence of high costs gold-
mining in Queensland has fallen to pieces.
The January output was £37,265, or £10,459
less even than for January, 1918, and only
about one-fifth of the average of 10 years
ago and one-seventh that of 20 years
ago. Matters are getting far more serious
in Queensland than the country seems to
realise.
The striking of improved values by Amal-
gamated Hill End (N.S.W.) gives some
backing to the argument that payable ore
exists below the levels reached to date.
The latest stone has come -from the
Mica vein, which produced sensations
in the early days. Relatively, the
Amalgamated is now unearthing more
gold than ever it did, and recent hap-
penings suggest that the co. would have
been much better off had it followed the
known veins instead of going on with the
big tunnelling schemes that absorbed most of
the £40.000 of capital and £13,000 of gold
up to the time the concern practically sur-
rendered its interests to the Marshall co.
The latter is now engaged principally in
carrying the Amalgamated tunnel north to
unwater the field and allow the picks to get
busy in new e-round. Meanwhile the Amal-
gamated intends to continue on the Mica
vein below the tunnel level, this work, along
with the tapping of the Star of Peace vein,
being the extent of its liberty under the
tribute agreement with Marshall’s, which
has about another 15 months to run.
The proposal by J. E. Scantlebury, man-
aging-director of the Amalgamated, for pool-
ing the interests on the Hill End field, had
a cold reception from the other cos. They
wouldn’t even discuss his scheme of one co.
with a nominal capital of in 4s.
shares, and a working capital of £25,000.
* * * *
There has been a further rumpus in the
Gundagai (N.S.W.) Long Tunnel camp, and
John Allen has taken over from Geo. Hep-
burn, who came from the Boddington
(W.A.I two years ago. Allen knows the
country well, having been 14 years under-
ground manager of the old British-owned
Gibraltar and having twice sampled the Long
Tunnel. When the bears and Government
Geologist Harper’s report knocked the mar-
ket endways a few, weeks ago, the Board
sent Allen to have a look. His report
was a very cheerful affair, though it didn’t
buck up the market to any extent. His
sampling gave an average of lTdwt. 13gr.
and he reckoned 14dwt. “should give regular
divs.” He also told shareholders that they
had “a valuable mine, under good manage-
ment.” It is now up to Allen to provide
the good management and the regular divs.

Wonderful what gleanings there are in big
Broken Hill mines. Broken Hill Prop, last
month picked up no less than 1663 tons
oxidised ore; yet the regular bodies of
oxidised ore were worked out 15 years ago.
True, B. H. Prop, hasn’t meantime been chas-
ing overlooked fragments of carbonate, like
its neighbor Block 14 has done.
The anything but rosy affairs of the old
Bodangora, Wellington (N.S.W.), have been
recited to Warden Farr, of Bathurst, who
sympathised to the extent of tw r o months’
suspension. It. D. Hartwell, Sydney
agent for the co., mentioned that the gold
won to date from the leases, a string of
which have been amalgamated, totalled
£68,934. Capital (£8512) and cash from
other sources (£141) permitted a total expen-
diture of £77,587. The gross expenses,
however, have been £89,472; and this makes
those running the show think hard. Wages
and contracts swallowed up £42.598: stores,
fuel and timber, £14.350; plant additions,
renewals and repairs, £2362—a1l independent
of the £15,900 paid for the mine, plant and
buildings. Shareholders got £3752 in divi-
dends. It is alleged that negotiations are in
progress with another 00. having enough
cash to take over the mine.

When the drought was cracked in Western
N. S. Wales the other day, Mt. Dudley’s big
catchment-area was passed by, and the bat-
tery was still held up for want of water at
the beginning of this week. Meantime manager
Martin is pushing ahead with development
and the shaft will soon be down to No. 3
level. He is already through with his ven-
tilation scheme. The Mines Department has
requested a consignment of Mt. Dudley ore
for exhibition at the Easter show. This
will enable the Pitt-street kerbstone miners
to sample the lode between drinks and ex-
press their opinion in the usual mild and
modest manner.
Water shortage is holding-up the 10-head
battery at Baker’s Creek (N.S.W.), which
has resumed the struggle to make ends
meet under new management. A clean-
up of 2890 z. gold from 210 tons stone, with
12oz. in the concentrates, is the latest per-
formance. The purchase of new plant out
of profits will delay possible divs. There
are 32,000 shares of 10s. each.
Cope’s Creek Central (N.S.W.) is storing
its tin oxide at present in the hope of a rise
in price. A block of eight acres alluvial
ground has been purchased at Bald Knob for
£2OO. If, as asserted, the purchase area
will yield wash worth l|lb., the price is very
moderate. But the chairman made the sig-
nificant remark at the meeting that work will
not be continued at a loss.
* * * *
There would very likely have been some-
thing doing among the prospectors out west
in N. S. Wales only for the shortage of
water. Scores of small syndicates have
men out testing the country from Cobar to
Mt. Hope. Some have got beautiful speci-
mens, and shows are pegged out all over the
west Bogan country; but until rain comes
little or nothing can be done. If there is
another Broken liill in N. S. Wales it prob-
ably hides between Cobar and Mt. Hope.
Doleful accounts come in about the con-
dition of most Westralian outback centres —-
tales of abandoned shows, rusting plant,
deserted camps. Prospecting is dead, and
no one is coming forward to take up the
ownerless reefs and search them for payable
shoots. The men who used to go out, nap
a reef, and, if gold wasn’t visible, pass on
have vanished. Meantime suggestions pour
into the Mines Department as to the best
means of spending the £50,000 recently
voted by Parliament for the revival of min-
ing. Most of them urge (1) that the money
be expended in trying to find new mines and
(2) giving those shows which furnished rich
yields in the early days, and then cut out,
another trial. The Minister is also advised
to give politicians, municipal councillors and
so-called leading citizens the go-by, and con-
sult the battlers who know most about the
gold-bearing areas of the State. It is good
advice as long as the Minister doesn’t believe
eaenything he is told.
Last year Westralia produced £352,000
worth of minerals other than gold. Copper
accounted for £66,486, tin £76,952, lead
£163,880, coal £24,424 and silver £13,815.
The copper came principally from Phillips
River, the tin from Greenbushes and the lead
from Northampton. Excluding gold, the
value of the minerals unearthed in the West
to date is roughly £5,000,000, of which about
three-fifths is represented by copper and tin.
Riverina South (W.A.) is about to do
what this paper urged it to do long ago, and
get ahead with development. If the co. had
given more attention to the mine instead of
rushing up a plant of doubtful efficiency cost-
ing £20,000, in place of thousands of tons
of indifferently treated residues on the sur-
face and no cash it would have had plenty
of cash in hand and many thousands more
tons of developed ore intact. As matters
now stand the co. is as poor as Lazarus, and
has little hope of making a rise.
Sons of Gwalia (W.A.) is doing as well
as can be expected. Last month’s output
of £17,000 from 13,000 tons showed a profit
of £2743, which is the best for some time
past. Despite heavier freights on supplies,
costs compare favorably with those of Ival-
goorlie shows. Underground appearances
are reported to be promising and ore
reserves are being fully maintained.

If New Red, White and Blue Consoli-
dated, with Walter Eskdale, Dyason, two
Lansells and H. W. C. Newman behind it,
can’t be shoved off the stocks at Bendigo, it
won’t be for. the want of either influence
or brains. Adventuring goes on from 1560 ft.
down to 1750 ft., which is a nice depth to be
prodding about in Bendigo. Quartz broken
by the co. itself has run at about 4|dwt., or
a shade under the pay mark, while tributors
have been winning sidwt. dirt and earning
more than a crust. The co. is onerating on
bedded veins at 1600 ft. and these at 1675 ft.
south show gold in odd patches; but better
prospects show up on the 1700 ft. reef, where
the co. has opened out over the tributors’ old
stopes above the 1560 ft. level. This, with a
color or two of gold in the 15ft. of stone
driven into in the 1600 ft. east crosscut,
means another string on which the Bendigo
fiddlers are starting to twang out the old
tune in the hope of raising a bit from the
more or less broke supporters of the field.
Reserves at Mt. Bischoff (Tas.) at the
end of 1918 were measured up thus

North stopes and North Valley flats 720,000 0.30 „
Total 1,125,000 0.20 „
This isn’t fat stuff at all, and it is by no
means clear that the run of ss. divs. will be
maintained. Every device for saving costs
has been installed. Of the half-year’s out-
put of 48,730 tons a big part came from the
gossan benches, where owing to a bit of
luck some pyritic stuff of above the usual
average was sent up. Most of the shoots
opened up on the northern slope are narrow,
with values ranging up to 1 p.c. tin. The
alluvial flats in the valley so far are not
being drawn on very much, but the dryness
of the season may account for that. Alto-
gether J. D. Millen knocked out a profit of
£21,536, with tin at £333 per ton in London.
Now it is £l3O less per ton, and, even if
Millen can get mining and milling done for
7s. 4d. per ton of ore, the drop must bring
profits a long way down towards the vanish-
ing ' point. The worst is that no fresh re-
serves are being found.

Long ago IT. P. Cecil gave up South Long
Tunnel, Walhalla (Tic.), satisfied that the
derelict could never pay, and went, intent
on introducing cheap working methods, to
the South Mt. Cameron’s sluicing job on
the banks of the Bingarooma (Tas.). A lot
of the ground had belonged to the Chinese,
and a Launceston co. had given up the ghost
after a long tussle. Cecil, however, has
kept things going, though it has been a tough
job, the tin in the wash being patchy, the
bottom uneven, and the water-supply vari-
able. Cecil’s last six months’ record of
31,650 cub. yds. gave 14 tons oxide, but the
turnover is small where it ought to be big.
As it is only a 3d. div. was scraped out of
the boxes. What will happen if tin drops
below £200 needn’t be discussed.

Died on the N.S.W. South Coast estimable
old J. B. Nicholson, who until a few months
ago had represented South Coast miners in
. Parliament for 27 years. He came in with
| the first wave—with Joe Cook, McGowen,
Frank Cotton, Cann, Alf Edden, George Black
and J. I). Fitzgerald. But the Labor party
wasn’t so brass-bound as it is in these days;
and when George Black proposed the famous
solidarity pledge, J. B. Nicholson, as a
staunch Protectionist who was committed to
a high tariff, had to stand out. But he came
back afterwards, and was one of the most
widely esteemed members of the party till
the conscription bomb blew the ends out. As
a trade-union leader among the miners he
was the contemporary of W. G. Spence and
,T. B. Burton in Victoria, of Tom Glassey in
Queensland, and James Curley in N. S.
Wales. Labor, pressing on, has long since
shouldered them out.
Died at East Melbourne, John Scliutt,
librarian at the Law Courts for more than
fifty years. His name looks foreign, but he
was born in Staffordshire 83 years ago. At
the Melbourne Law Courts they have oil
portraits of several judges of the old days,
and a couple of years back when Schutt
celebrated his half-century on the premises,
the Bar got him to sit for his portrait, and
it now hangs among the dead-and-gone
judges. Schutt, who had been a school-
master in his early days, was in himself a
library to the barristers, particularly the
youngsters. If one wanted a case to quote
to the Bench it was “Ask Schutt”; and
Schutt was always obliging. He has a son
at the Bar.
A Bulletin woman’s memory of just-dead
Laurier: —•
The great French-Canadian was in London, the
guest of the nation, at some Imperial Conference,
lie was waiting for one of the Royal carriages; I
was stalking a ’bus. One recognised him instantly.
No man was ever more like his photographs: lean
and ascetic, with masses of heavy iron-grey hair
swept off his forehead. Very carefully dressed —like
an Englishman, perhaps, who has lived much in
Paris. His silk hat was raised repeatedly to acknow-
ledge the salutations of passers-by. The State landau
- —-very like an over-boiled lobster —rumbled up. A
footman, amazingly agile considering his gorgeous
trappings, jumped off the box. The carriage door
was opened, and a personality so vivid and magnetic
that no lapse of time weakens the memory of it
melted into the fog of a November afternoon.
Vic. Government has decided to appoint
a third Railway Commissioner in place of E.
B. Jones, who became second Commissioner
on the death of McClelland 20 months ago.
The man who beats Minogue, State Under-
Treasurer, will get the job, which carries a
salary of £1750 a year. Lawson, Robinson,
McWhae and others are impressed with
Minogue as a financial expert; and Bowser
has been interested in him since he moulded
the scheme accepted by Parliament last ses-
sion for utilising the cable-tramway profits.
If, however, a railway man is to get the
selection, Shannon, Chief Mechanical Engi-
neer, will not be overlooked.
“Karee” : Near Sailly, in French Flanders,
is a holding named Jesus Farm, after its
owner. M. Jesus had been billeting soldiers
so long that he was an artist at getting
something for nothing. He got the wh°e l er-

corporal to repair
all his farm wag-
gons free, the shoe-
ing-smith to shoe
all his farm cavalry
and mend his toois,
and the saddler to
fix up his harness.
When that particu-
lar job had been
settled, the harassed
n c.o. asked sar-
castically : “A ny-
thing else you’d
bke, Frenchy?” M.
Jesus nodded
brig h 11 y, and
brought a pair of
ancient bluchers to
be re-soled.
At the 1890 conference called to consider
Australian Federation each State (including
M.L., but excepting Westralia) had two
delegates. Only five are left —Samuel
Griffith (Q.), Alfred Deakin (Vic.), John
Cockburn (S.A.), Stafford Bird (Tas.) and
Wm. McMillan (N.S.W.).
Geddes White, the new Methody president
in S. Aus., is the church architect between
sermons.
Ex-Premier Dick Scaddan of Westralia
was a member of a syndicate which recently
took £l9OO from a Tatt. sweep.
A FURTHER ADJOURNMENT.
“The Culcairn Shire Council’s meeting lapsed last
night for the want of a quorum. Arrangements are
being made to meet next Friday a mile outside the
town in a paddock.”
COUNCILLOR MCTURK ( heatedly ) : “I move
that the council starnds adjourned until
sic a tame as Councillor McMurphy re-
moves, chops off, ringbarks or otherwise
destroys his insanitary whuskers —'tis
a menace to the whole council they are."
Archbish. Mannix is now a sort of brother
of ours. He has bought out the Winters
and become proprietor of the Melbourne
Advocate.
Bertram Mackennal, the Australian,
sculped the new Edward VII. statue which,
held back in England by the war, is soon to
be shipped and erected in Adelaide. The
still unknighted Cohen raised the necessary
£6OOO when he was mayor.
James Henderson Howe, ex-S. Aus. legis-
lator, will be 80 on March 4. His chief
claim to remembrance by many thousands
of Australians rests on the fact that he
was responsible for securing the introduc-
tion in the Commonwealth Constitution of
the provision for old-age pensions. Howe
is a Scotsman, and before he entered Parlia-
ment, in 188jl. was in the mounted police.
•Jenkin Coles, who was a member of the
same Ministry, Itnd Speaker for 21 years,
was a police trooper at the same time as
Howe.
Another of the Smiths is coming home
with an unusual bunch of decorations. He
is Stanley Smith, a Junee farmer, who
started off when he reached 18, not three
years ago. As a lance-corporal, he won
the D.C.M. by kamerading a whole strong-
point garrison ; and he also has the Military
Medal, the Military Cross and a lieutenancy.
“8.0. N.” : Albert Charles Willis, secretary
of the Australasian Coal and Shale
Employees’ Federation, is as much like the
revolutionary socialist ,you dream about as
Billy Hughes is like Julius Knight. A mild
and amiable man pf about 40, slightly bald,
with light blue, eyes set widely apart, lie
suggests a jovial monk in civvies. He
lias a family and keeps fowls, and when he
makes or hears a new joke his laugh carries
half-a-mile. I heard him deliver almost his
first speech in Australia. It was at Bel-
lambi, on the N.S.W. South Coast, about
five years ago. He was then working at
Balmain as a coal-miner. It impressed the
South Coast miners so much that they made
nim president of the union at the succeeding
election, and when, later, he opposed Peter
Bowling for the secretaryship he succeeded
in beating that hardy old campaigner by a
huge majority. Willis is one of the most
effective speakers in Australia. He is
eloquent, concise and sounds sincere, anyway.
When the Australian editors came home
they mostly talked of Mark Sykes as the
most eloquent man they heard in England.
He was a Yorkshireman, M.P. for Hull,
immensely wealthy—his mother was a
Cavendish-Bentinck—and, especially when
he talked about Turkey, his language burned.
r lhe British mission took him to Paris as
expert adviser about “the near East”: for
he had been writing about Turkey ever since
he was 21, when he published “Through Five
Turkish Provinces.” ’Flu found him in
lans ; pneumonia followed, and the brilliant
scholar, writer and orator, for whom the
greatest things were foretold, died at 30.
His widow is a daughter of that Sir J. E.
Gorst who, setting out to be a missionary in
Maoriland, changed his mind, returned to
England and became a colleague of Lord
Salisbury’s.
Flinders had, perhaps, the biggest share in
making the name “Australia” current in the
English language, butt he didn’t
invent it. The man who did that
seems to have been the Frenchman
Kerguelen, who used “Australie”
a couple of times in a memorandum
written in 1772. Shaw, writing
in 1793, seems to have been the
first English writer to talk of
“Am'ralia.” “Australasia” was
coined earlier by another French-
man, Charles Des Brosses, who
used it in a book published in 1756.
The adjective “Australien” appears
in French as far hack as 1693, and
in 1699 it appears in official letters
about exploring the coast of
Westralia. Of course De Quiros,
the Spaniard, worked towards our
name with his “Austrialia” about
a century before that. But he
didn’t mean Australia.
Within a year the work of the
Wheat Board may terminate and
H. A. Pitt, the manager (£l2OO. a
year), who was lent by Vic.
Treasury, will be out of a job. lie
is ei. titled to go back to the
Treasury, and the best billet available. —that
of accountant, carrying £BOO a year —is now
vacant. But it is doubtful whether Pitt
will return to the Civil Service. Private
Enterprise may find more money for him
when it takes charge again.
President Woodrow Wilson has both
Scotch and Irish blood. His father, .also a
professor, was the son of an Ulster emigrant;
who left County Down in 1807 and became
a compositor in Philadelphia and ultimately
a well-to-do newspaper proprietor. The
President’s mother was daughter of a
Scotch Presbyterian minister, and her ear-
liest years were spent in England. .Little
Woodrow was extremely late in beginning
his education, not being taught the-alphabet
till he was nine. At Princeton University
—he went in 1875 —he wasn’t brilliant, and
only graduated 41st in a class of 122.
The Law Society of South Aus. has elected
Grundy, K.C., as its president, on the
resignation of Josiah Symon, who had held
office since John Downer died in 1915.
To settle an argument in the Adelaide
Supreme Court recently Justice Gordon said,
he would consult Professor Wigmore’s “Law
of Evidence” to decide the matter. Gordon
mentioned that Professor Wigmore had just
completed his 25th year as Dean of the
Faculty' of Law in the Illinois University,
and in celebra-
tion a number
of the lights of
the profession in
different parts
of the world
had been asked
t o contribute
articles to a

of the Illinois

was by Sir

PROFESSOR
BERRY .
of Melbourne
“The Oldest Inhabitant”: Apropos Dr.
Brissenden’s monocle, we had one on the
N.S.W. bench many years ago. The late
Chief Justice James Martin always carried
a rimless eyeglass in his vest pocket, and
used it, holding it ’twixt finger and thumb,
when lie wished to see who was at the Bar
table. It was most in use in the Banco
Court in the morning, when it was the
custom to call on each counsel present, com-
mencing with the senior. If counsel had
anything to say, he said it; if he had not, he
simply rose in his place and bowed.
THE QUEENS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I’ve read a power of printed stuff,
Jests, memoirs, diaries and odes,
By turn-coats, tourists, democrats,
Honest believers and ex-toads,
Expressive of the cheerful grins,
The pious joy, the petty flings
Of you and me and him and her,
About the downfall of the kings.
Though no slow music plays them out,
No spotlight falls on dimming scenes,
To me there’s pity in it all:
Somehow I’m sorry for the queens.
The pride that was not really power,
The wealth that never was their own,
The pomp and high pretentious ’ claims
Bound them with fetters to the throne.
Bred up stiff-necked, between four walls.
Wed, unconsulted, in their teens,
To Some blonde, weak-kneed autocrat —•
Oh, yes, I’m sorry for the queens.
In the old days they played their play
Out to the end, for throne and crown,
With axes battering at the doors
Of throne-rooms, till the heads rolled dowzil
Risings and raids and escapades,
And stout hearts rallying to the king;
Swords, traitors, midnight funerals—
The women liked that sort of thing.
To-day the exiled princess hears
Across the telephone her fate,
Wires her intentions to the press,
Then taxies to a neutral State.
There the pinched poor pretence begins,
Detailed by social nress report—-
Her petulance, her irksome tale:
“In old times, at my father’s court....*'
Or, “When my husband held the throne...
While Time, where gayer courtiers fawned,
Mars the small, pretty, useless hands,
The white neck, whence the pearls were pawned.
The humblest women drink life dry.
Hark to the girl across the way:
“Feelin’ the heat yet? No, not me.
Ain’t it a bonzer washin’ day?
“Why have I whitened all the steps
An’ hung noo winder-blinds and that?
Say, ain’t you heard? Jim’s coinin’ home!”
(Her hero, in his old felt hat ;
Six-foot and tanned, a god in bronze.
Hers, for she knows past pang of doubt;
There’s not an exile life could send
But Jim would come and seek her out.)
Yes, when at last the lie is nailed,
The chaff is threshed, the dust is sieved,
The hardest thing queens have to bear
Is this: they never really lived.
Throne-loungers, royal shufflers, loons,
These were their mates, crowned might-have-
beens .
Sold in the cradle, yoked till death.
Hang it! I’m sorry for the queens.

ADJUSTING CONDITIONS.
The war is over, but not done with. There
are awful messes to be cleaned up, and much
patience and charity will be needed. The
■‘haves” and the “have nots” must learn to
pool resources, for great wealth and extreme
poverty, educated selfishness and gross illit-
eracy can no longer exist side by side in the
same community. The lesson, emphasised
by the war, that “we are all members one of
another.” will have to be accepted with its
implications, and a way discovered of apply-
ing it in practical life. The' Whitley report
is one. such attempt, and the new education
provisions of the British Government, which
seek to atone for the past by spreading the
humanities over the whole of British life,
thus making it fuller and more abundant
than it has ever been yet, is another. These
conditions have in some directions already
been anticipated by employers of labor.
With others, Cadbury Brothers, at their
Bournville works, have always sought to
provide such opportunities for their people.
Continuation classes and physical training
(in employer's time) have been obligatory
upon their young people, for the sake of
“the healthy mind in the healthy body”;
result, greater efficiency. Brought into con-
tact through the Adult School with the sor-
did conditions of the working classes in a
great factory town, Bournville was Itichard
and George Cadbury’s contribution towards
the betterment of those conditions. In spy-
ing this expression to their aim in life, they
have made Bournville an example of world-
wide recognition,— Advt.

SOCIETY
The censorship viewed from the sea :
The censorship excelled itself when dealing with
the dispositions of the Australian warships. During
the greater part of 1915 and 1919 it was our job to
potter about the coasts of the two Americas showing
COMPENSATIONS.
“I suppose you missed the surf-hathing over there?"
“Oh, yes —hut we always had the trenches to paddle in."
the flag anrl looking into ports to let the sheltering
Huns know the policeman was still on the beat.
In fact, we often got specific orders to proceed to
such and such a place, show ourselves and steam
away. The signal-stations ashore always sighted us
and hailed us by name: “Say, boys, are you the
Sydney? Come right along in and have a cocktail.”
That’s how they used to talk to us across the three-
mile limit. A few days afterwards we would read
in the Yank papers that “the great Australian battle-
ship Sydney” had been off the port. The notice was
usually embellished by a photograph and a full
description of the ship. There were two ship’s
censors aboard appointed by the captain, and the
writer was one of them. The captain considered it
unnecessary to censor the mail to Australia, as it
was usually two or three months in transit and the
news too old to be valuable. This went on for
nearly a year; then one day some amateur Sherlock
Holmes was installed at the Navy Office, Melbourne,
as naval censor. The result was that, unknown to
us, our intimacies to wives and others were thumbed,
and the letters hacked anti mutilated and finally
forwarded after great delay. It showed an amazing
ignorance on somebody’s part of the job on which
these ships were engaged. We were told to adver-
tise our presence off the American coast for the
benefit of the Iluns ashore. Surely the responsible
officers on the spot were more likely to know what
was valuable to the enemy than some ill-informed
ass in Melbourne.
“Henry Horsecollar” : Thank Heaven, the
League of Nations’ standard isn’t exactly a
tricolor —three broad horizontal stripes, top
and bottom white and the centre blue. The
world is reeking with tricolors—mostly red,
white and blue, arranged horizontally or
perpendicularly, and the changes have been
rung until no new Hag of the sort can start
without infringement of copyright. In the
great forerunner the blue and white were the
colors of the city of Paris and the red repre-
sented the old monarchy; nevertheless the
combination came to stand for Liberty,
Equality- and Fraternity, so it is sacred.
But it is to a great extent already out of
date. Fraternity is right off the bill: half
the voters in democratic countries couldn’t be
brothers if they tried, though they make very
good sisters. And as to the other things,
international finance has made it possible for

out conquest. The tricolor was good in its
day, like the single-furrow plough, but its

“Coot”: Pearce’s department bungled, as
usual, when it set out to supply Billjim with
a will form. The thing did not contain any
clause providing- for the appointment of an
executor. Hence endless trouble ensued
when Billjim went west, and needless expense
had to be incurred by those he desired to
benefit. In one recent ease at Geelong the
soldier left everything to Dad, and probate
had to be applied for “by a person described
in the will as Dad.” Fortunately thousands
of the boys took advantage of the lawyers’
patriotic offer to prepare wills free of charge,
otherwise Costs would have formed a leading
item in the winding up of many a Digger’s
affairs.
“F.R.”: The Iluns raided Belah (Pales-
tine) three nights in succession, and, despite’
the fact that they dropped over 500 bombs,
our only casualty was a mule. Each even-
ing we were warned by G.H.Q. that we could
expect a visit from the Huns at a certain
time, and sure enough the ’planes always
arrived just when we expected them. The
man who did it was an officer in a British
regiment who had lived for several years in
Constantinople. Once, dressed as an Arab,
he entered a Bedouin camp near Beersheba
and stayed there for several weeks. I first
met the elusive chap north of Bir-el-Mazar
We were doing outpost duty a couple of
miles from Abdul's position and just as
dawn was breaking noticed a well-dressed
Arab coming towards us. We halted him and
in'''-clu'd him to our headquarters, where he
refused to answer our questions in English
or Arabic. Later on we placed him on a
camel and escorted him to G.11.Q., where

several English officers ran out anti con-
gratulated him on his safe return. Then
he turned around and said : “Sorry to have
put you to so much trouble, boys.” The
other day he entered Damascus with the
Arab troops from Mecca. Every soldier who
was in Palestine will be glad to know that
tlx; marvel is still alive.

“Anchor A. 8.” : After the Australia joined
her sisters in the North Sea, Admiral Patey
was transferred lo the Leviathan, an ancient
tub of enormous size but little utility. Patey
was then sent out to take charge of the
North America-West Indies station, of which
the Sydney and Melbourne were the only
decent units. The flagship was not popu-
lar. No flagships are; but this packet was
more hated than usual, because she did her
sea-time in harbor at Halifax all the summer
and in Kingston all the winter. One day
there were several ships in Halifax where
the old Levi, had just put in four months
solid. She suddenly decided to t\uau 0 u
buoys, a distance of about 200 y Is. The'
crew’ of the Suffolk —a hardy and consistent
seagoer—lined up, and as the “flag” moved
oil' somebody counted three and all hands
yelled : “Look ! Look ! Look ! By , the
o’d can steam after all!” Patey sig-
nalled to know what the disturbance was.
The captain of the Suffolk replied adroitly:
I am at a loss to account for if, but imagine
that two of the ship’s-clogs must be lighting
on the forecastle.”

This paper’s Melbourne art-critic is sad :
After viewing the Federal Parliament’s portrait
g".llery in the Queen’s Hall you realise that the
stencilling of official attitudes has become the
passion of a clique. All the personality has been
crus.led out of these people by posturing them in a
complete immobility, with scarcely a gleam of man-
nerism to quicken identification. Practically all of
' the figures stand stricken with a vertical catalepsy,
their poor stiff legs apparently ripe, for burial, and
their faces, sterile of any emotion, suggesting the
unknown in search of the unknowable. Only in the
painting of the hands have the illustrators allowed
themselves some relaxation. In fear of that repeti-
tion which is the most tedious form of parody, they
have refrained from painting the hands stiffly” at the
sides in at least half a dozen cases. Albert Goulcl
to( s v\ ith his official cravat, which just saves the
shortsighted from assuming that the cx-Senator has
bee i caught napping. Barton fingers his watch-chain.
Andrew Fisher, in a drab suit, is nailed to the floor
and holds a rolled paper like a life-preserver
Charlie McDonald, whose chief claim to notice is a
forefinger greatly out of drawing, supports a pair of
eyeglasses with all the symptoms of approaching-
exhaustion. Alfred Deakin lays the two first fingers
of his right on the palm of his flabby left, and the
action conveys a suspicion of dogmatic discourse
which the rest of Alfred refuses to confirm. It is
the same among the tired G.-G.’s who reside close to
the roof. The scarlet and. blue of their robes, the
shimmer of white satin and silk hose, the glint of
decorations and sword-hilts need not influence you to
promote any of them from the neuter gender. The
canvases are just glittering post-mortems on
departed souls, revealing to one the futility of face 3
and the Tussaud-like symmetry of vice-regal legs.
There is one picture in the collection that escapes
censure. It is Lambert’s view of George Reid, which
almost every artist laughs about and the more
unenlightened despise for its doubtful likeness. But
the picture is George Reid—probably George after
his fourth packet of lollies, with all his lazy
faculties concentrated on finding the most restful
position for the major portion of his anatomy.
Lambert scores because he scorns the ornate dissimu-
lations of academic portraiture. Unlike his more
constrained competitors he drew his model as he
found him out.
What happens now when Billjim comes
marching home. Cutting from the Nepean
Times (N.S.W.)
Aid. T. Jones also welcomed the boys back home
again. He himself had been an old soldier, though
his days of soldiering were now over; but he knew
what it was, and he had helped the boys at the
front as much as he could. He concluded a humor-
ous and happy address by asking those present for a
collection to pay for the lights.
Still plenty of free gas for soldiers, but it
is not illuminating.

Boiled in the city’s muzzled stew, •
My brains uncoil, my thoughts are few.
I damply lift the printed page
That tells me how the heathen rage,
And how the fata] moment i tick
For Spartacus and Bolshevik ;
While Conferences air their views,
Mostly to cause the dance of Hughes—-
That quick-step, wild and high and free,
Performed with great agility
When lie refuses to agree.
Oh, for the lilting of a breeze !
There is no joy in things like these.
The influenza totals rise
No faster than a man who trie;!
To climb the weary hill of fame
By doing deeds without a name
On starless nights when no one’s eyes
Ar; there the fact to advertise.
Oh, hang the rhymes ! They cannot cure
The seggy, seething temperature.
The statesmen shut the beer away.
No pretty, clinking ice can play
At tinkle-tinkle with the glasi
To help the swelter-watch to pass.
Warm water is the only drink.
Though I can talk, I cannot think;
And in this sweat-house of creation
The date is my one consolation.
Yes, February slidei away;
Cool weather cannot long delay ;
And Autumn, with a balm to shed,
Will put a blanket on my bed.
It seems quite good to tell of that
Beneath the dripping of my hat,
To know that I shall feel again
The pleasant working of my brain
And say with zeal, when sharp winds fold
My whiskers in a cloak of cold,
From niggard May to green September:
“The hottest summer I remember!”

THU DEADLY ’FLU’.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I met my friend McGraw to-day;
A very solemn man wai he.
Deep furrows on his forehead lay ;
He greeted me most seriously.
“I say, old man, in Melbourne town
The influenza’s playing Hell!
To-morrow I was going down,
But, now, in light of . what’s befell,
I’ll have to keep away from there.”
He stopped, and slowly shook his head.
Hi i grave concern gave me a scare—
I visioned half of Melbourne dead.
I murmured some consoling word,
And asked how many dead might be.
He stared as if he hadn't heard.
“The dead?” he vaguely answered me.
“I don’t know if there’s many (lied ;
I s'pose there must be one or two.”
“Well, what in Hell” I sharply cried.

“ADAMAX” ROOFING for REAL PERMANENCE
Certain competitors of ours have stated that “Adamax” Roofing is only
bought because galvanised-iron is so scarce, and that now the War is over
Adamax roofing' will go out of existence.
We take this opportunity of stating that
“ADAMAX
33
Asphaltum Roofing
is here to stay, and that behind it is the selling organisation of a firm that
for over 30 years has been associated with merchandise of real worth
merchandise that gives its buyers the honest value they look for and
should get.
We sell Adamax” Roofing on its merits, and in comparison with Galvan-
ised-iron Adamax” comes out an easy winner.
It is Rust-proof, Rot-proof, Element-proof, TIME-PROOF, Trouble-proof.
Acids, Gases, Chemical Fumes, etc., harm it not, whereas they quickly
settle Galvanised-iron.
There is nothing in “Adamax” to dry out--so that Rain, Heat, Cold,
Wind, etc., have no ill-effect on it (you know how they damage Iron Roofs).
Adamax” saves time, worry and money.
It Costs only One-third the Price of Galvanised-iron.
Have you a logical reason why “Adamax” should not be your choice ? —-
just as it was of the Imperial Authorities, who ordered 120 miles of
Adamax” for covering Wheat- and Wool-slieds in Australia alone?
We would be pleased to go into details with you and put you right on any
point of doubt. Write for free Descriptive Pamphlet and Samples.
Adamax is sold in rolls 72 feet x 3 feet in 1-ply (thin), 2-ply (medium),
3-ply (thick), each roll covering 22 sq. yds. allowing for 2in. overlap.

“Chloe”: The precaution which seems to
have kept the present ’flu epidemic from the
Malays is the simple gargle habit practised
from infancy. They take a quart of sea
water, or a solution of common salt and
ammonia, fill the mouth well, gargle the
throat without swallowing any of the fluid,
then expel through the nostrils with all pos-
sible force. The Malays on the pearling
fleets do this till' you are tired of watching.
They stand on the for’ard deck spouting
through the nostrils like whales. I have
never seen or heard of a Malay with nose,
throat or pulmonary disease, except when
debased by too much European influence.
When the Australian aborigines were dying
wholesale after pneumonic measles (very
like influenza), the Malays were free from
infection. They were close neighbors and
in many cases nursed the blacks. Another
Malayan preventive is to chew for a few
minutes a small section of camphor and
expectorate freely after passing anything
decayed or ill-smelling. They are among
the cleanest people in the world, and the
most sensitive to ill odors. I attribute their
immunity from nearly all the modern ills to
their habit of sluicing.

“Dial Sight”: The Sardinia case is no
isolated one. On our transport 150 “war-
babies,” returned as too youthful for trench
life, exhibited sufficient belligerency to put
the ship in a state of mutiny for several
days. After one young blackguard had been
found dropping lighted matches into the hold,
a police unit was mustered amongst the
GONE THROUGH SOMETHING.

Doctor?”
DOCTOR: “Know him? He was a patient of
mine for years before he icent to the
war.”
SHE: “Good gracious! What marvellous
escapes that man has had.”
saner minds ot the troopship, and 12 of the
ringleaders were placed in detention. Given a
weak 0.C., and too big a proportion of the
undesirables on the same ship, especially if
they include a Bolshevik or two, and you have
all the elements of a first-class mutiny. There
are plenty of men who have handled brigades
in masterly fashion in France for months,
and nothing short of the best of these
should be given charge of a transport. The
dealing with this undesirable element on
ON THE BLOCK.
“What’s that little officer wearing spurs for?”
“Why do roosters wear ’em? To catch the fowls, I suppose .”
arrival home is another problem. To
imagine the wastrel and sneak-thief will
suddenly become an honest citizen with high
ideals is foolish. To make concessions
because they have been on active service
is misplaced generosity. The decent B 11-
jim—l include the one who may occasionally
break out into a jag on some hot evening—
will need no such concessions, as he will be
just the same good bloke, with the same sense
of a fair thing, as he was on the other side.
To cull out the undesirable that has done
much to besmirch the Diggers* reputation is
one of the ticklish problems that the Repa-
triation Department shouldn’t lose sight of.
“A.T.”: Not all British senior naval-
officers have the genius of Nelson or the
brains of Beatty. In 1916 there was a
submarine scare among the fleet of North
America. Our cruiser proceeded
into harbor and was assigned a
position alongside a wharf. As
a protection against torpedoes a
merchant ship was put alongside
us, presumably to explode the
torpedo and leave us unharmed.
We all felt grateful and slept well
till we found out that the buffer
ship was laden with coal and ex-
plosives !
“Lahma”: A small Syrian vil-
lage clinging to the side of a
sheer mountain-slope on the coast
near Beyrout bears the name of
Junee. The houses, precariously
jutting out from the steep hill-
side, resemble rock staghorns in
withstanding wind and weather.
These dwellings, through which
flow small aqueducts supplied by
springs, are reached only by long-
tortuous paths. On the topmost
ledge of the mountain a massive
stone figure of a man stands with hand
extended. Don’t know what or who he is
welcoming. Perhaps he is asking for bak-
sheesh. # #
“0.L.”: Some singularly disgusting prac-
tices have been disclosed by the’flu outbreak
in Melbourne. Attention has been drawn
to the condition of hospital mortuaries “not
cleaned out for months” ; the piling up of
cadavers on the floors instead of their being
placed on individual slabs; the side-tracking
of mortuary trains just outside the Central
Station; the delivery of foodstuffs by “con-
tacts” ; the assemblage of fighting multi-
tudes, breathing beer and onions and assorted
pestilence, around modulation depots, in the
absence of any official queue-system; the
overcrowding of hospitals; the illegal pack-
ing of soft-drinkeries with swarms of steamy
souls, such places in many cases being merely
a cellar; the shortage of bathrooms at coii-
valesceries; the service of deficient food at
auxiliary hospitals; and so on —and on.
The Vic. Government is definitely responsible
for these conditions, because its Health
Department very effusively took “control” of
matters when the epidemic got well going.
No doubt a shortage of doctors could not
well be avoided, nor perhaps a lack of ward-
helps, though the rate of pay for girls with
St. John certificates was never raised above
18s. 6d. a week, despite the extra dangers of
the new job. But in matters of beastliness
and mismanagement the Cabinet has a lot
to answer for.
From the Age report of the recent fires
in the Otway Forest (Vic.) :
The Presbyterian church, the public hall and
Roman Catholic church were destroyed and several
private houses were burned. It was only by stupen-
dous efforts that the Ditchley Park Hotel was saved.
Homes and altars might go up in smoke,
but the pub had to be saved at all costs.
They’ve got a proper respect for beer down
there.
“Bill Bile”: I have heard it asserted that
very little is known of Australia in the
United States. Don’t you be-
lieve it! This country is well
advertised as the happy hunt-
ing-ground of all the dollar-
chasing crowd of cranks in Wil-
s o n’s dominions —revivalists,
spiritualists, food-f addi s t s,
Christian scientists, Mormons.
Cheerless tub-thumpers of every
kind descend on these shores and
all do well for themselves, and
leave us poorer. At the present
moment, when it takes all a poor
devil’s time to keep his head
above water, we are importuned
by a posse of Yanks bearing a
banner with the crackjaw device
“Chautauqua.” They’re not
here for their health —or ours.
Then we have the
U.S.A. prohibitionist,
who swears to shut
every pub in Australia
before he is “through,”
and starts his cam-
paign by taking up the
usual collection. In-
sult and injury ! God
knows we’ve got
enough wowsers of our own. Can t we do
our own “reforming”? Shall we suffer these
imported parasites on top of our own
(roubles? Haven’t we got a kick left in us.' 1
* * * *
“Corporal Cobber” : I’m glad to hear from
the transport’s chief officer (B. 13/2/T9)
who has carried all sorts of troops that
every kind except Aussies are a real pleasure
to travel with. One thing he didn’t mention,
though. Did he ever take these other
fellows back from the war ? That makes
all the difference. In France or Palestine
and on the way there, with the war on, an
order was an order, and no questions were
asked or reasons wanted. But. as Billy
Hughes has instructed the Demobilisation
people in Europe, we are citizens again now ;
and we reckon we have a right to be treated
as intelligent, reasoning beings. For in-
stance, on the arrival of the Somali at
Adelaide the men were not told anything
definite as to whether they would be per-
mitted to land. Eight weeks of imprison-
ment on the ship without any shore leave
had been endured, and the 1200 men were
just as irritable as one might expect after
being cooped up in a small space for two
months. Immediately on arrival the South
Australians were told to parade at the head
of the gangway with kits up and shore-going
uniform on all ready to disembark. After
standing in line half an hour, cheerful as
schoolboys, they were ordered below again
and no reason given. Naturally the men
swore. Next day the same senseless process
was gone through. This time the men did
more than swear. They mutinied and
threatened to seize the ship. All the trouble
could have been avoided had the men been
treated as’ reasoning beings by the officer in
charge. This was proved in Melbourne
waters a few days later. The evening we
dropped anchor off Port Melbourne he called
all the men together and told them that a
suspicious case of sickness had. developed on
board and that if by the morning it did not
show satisfactory features no leave could be
given. The “mutineers” of a few days
days before cheered him when he finished his
talk, and remarked, one to the other, “W hy
haven’t we been told things at other ports:”
And there you have it.
“The Full Court occupied the next month,
and then the dam case was resumed.” This
is the decorous Adelaide Register giving a
list of cases blocked in the Supreme Court
of S.A. The Manoora Dam trial stands
over from last year, half heard, and claims
against the Government brought by the
Glenelg breakwater contractors (over
£50,000) and the S.A. Co. (about half a
million) have either to be put off indefinitely
or to block all other work. The Leg.
Council unexpectedly threw out last session
a Fourth Judge Bill, regarded up till the
last moment as such a certainty that the
new wig was being named; and with
Buchanan, one of the present three, quaran-
tined in Sydney, the crush is becoming a
scandal.
* * * *
“Bert It.’”: The unfairness of the legal
system in the A.I.F. was driven home ro
many a good soldier when he got his paybook
back. All the time spent in detention
awaiting trial is forfeited, and a man re-
manded for court-martial at a busy time
might have to wait anything from three
weeks upwards for a trial. In Part TI
Orders it was not uncommon to see a sen-
tence of “2S days’ detention,” followed by
“awaiting trial 63 days ; total forfeiture 91
days.” This represents £22 15s. in hard
cash. Instances are numerous where men
ordered to undergo heavy sentences for
purely technical offences have been in this
way converted into chronic loafers on their
mates.
* * * *
“Karee”: Colonel Gus, the popular C.O.
of the 11th F.A.8., had snared Blighty leave
DISAPPOINTING.
"Just fancy! Flo's engaged to a lieutenant,
a V.C. and a D.S.O. Oh, blow — it’s all
the same man!”
but didn’t fancy travelling by the crowded
leave train to Boulogne, so tackled General
Bubbly for a loan of his car. The General
agreed on condition that Gus sent him fish
for his mess from Boulogne. It was only
as the latter ascended the boat gangway the
next day that his conscience and memory
began to work. Away he rushed to the
nearest store and bought a tin of sardines,
which he entrusted to the care of Bubbly’s
driver. The General had asked some Eng-
lishmen to mess on the strength of the
coming fish, and when the tin of sardines hit
him the explosion made Fritz think a bar-
rage was on.
MY PRINCIPLES.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“The Rev. H. Worrall said that it was an insult
to Protestants that the Government should seek to
place the hospital at Melbourne Exhibition in charge
of Roman Catholic nuns. When people were ill
it was highly objectionable that they should have
forced upon them views and customs with which
they had no sympathy.”
Although not steeped in bigotry,
Grave ills by me would be endured
Rather than that my ills should be
By any Scarlet Woman cured.
No doctor by my bed shall stand
Who is not first of all prepared
To show my views on Wilson and
On Billy Hughes by him are shared.
If I succumb, I hope no base
Protectionist will make my shroud ;
Nor would I in my oaken case
Be laid by one of Labor’s crowd.
If, as I struggle hard for breath,
An anti-vegetarian laid
His hand upon my brow, then death
Would sting me e’en beyond the shade.
I’d fain of yellow fever die,
Nor would I in my coffin squirm,
If sure that I’d be eaten by
A self-respecting Orange worm.

POLITLCL
POINTS
THE NEW ORDER.
J IM: “Say, Bill, who’s the gent.? What’s
’is medal for?”
BILL: “Shh! Don’t show your ignorance —
Returned Politicians’ Association, er
course!”
A deputation which called on N.S.W.
Commissioner Fraser about overcrowding in
railway carriages received the usual cold
assurance that there aren’t enough .carriages
or enough locomotives either, so people will
just have to crowd. A little carriage-build-
ing is done here—that is to say, imported
steel plates and other imported things are
gummed together. The last annual report
showed that in 12 months six passenger car-
riages were built in N.S.W. out of some
scraps that were left over. But the supply
of imported material stopped 44 years ago.
and in all that time Australia, instead of
providing work for its people by making the
stuff itself, sat with infinite patience on its
hunkers, and waited for the imported goods
and the imported loan to pay for them.
Through this habit of infinite waiting the
hunkers of Australia are nearly worn
through.
Australia is being inundated with copies
of a circular begging this country to hurry
up and subscribe to the Swiss Exporter.
A commercial intelli-
gence service, it seems,
has also been estab-
lished “for the purpose
of creating a medium
of direct information
between foreign buyers
and Swiss products of
good standing and to
keep interested parties
regularly acquainted
with industrial de-
velopments in Switzer-
land.” The Exporter
and its agency have
been set up in Zurich,
the canton which talks
German and is separ-
ated from Germany
only by the Rhine.
And until the Com-
monwealth Parliament
gets to work on the
tariff there isn’t much
more of a barrier
between Zurich and Australia.
Some comments on the Bolshevik Govern-
ment in Russia drove N.S.W. Labor Secre-
tary Evans to declare publicly that all
Bolshevik atrocities' are invented by the
capitalist press. He says proudly that in
a country where women have the vote as in
Russia (they have had it for a few months)
they simply can’t be enslaved as described.
Well, N. S. Wales has had manhood suffrage
and vote by ballot for 61 years and woman-
hood suffrage since 1902, and if its men and
women aren’t enslaved by the capitalist then
Evans and his friends have been pulling the
public’s leg all along.
A circumstance of the week was a discus-
sion about the conditions under which certain
members of the Seamen’s Union went to the
United States to bring hither one of the
Commonwealth ships built over there. No-
body in union circles in Australia seemed to
care 2d. about the skilled and expensive job
of building the ships he.’*e. But the union
was adamant on the point that' the job of
being a scrubber, deck-sweep and brass-
cleaner on board should be reserved for Aus-
tralians even though the matter at issue was
the single trip from America to this country.
The right of our people to the coolie billets
isn’t to be lightly set aside.
Many reserves were created in the bad
Tory days of Queensland —for water, for
travelling stock, for imaginary schools and
visionary recreations. This is how most of
them happened. When the early cocky had
taken up as much land as he could at the
time stagger under, he kept a keen eye on
his overloaded neighbor and the 80- or 100-
acre plot that both of them coveted. Usu-
ally they fixed it up between them to have
it set aside as “a reserve for travelling
stock.” Then they ran their cattle on it,
paid no rates, and flourished. So did the
prickly-pear. One good thing Ryan has
done has been to throw open scores of these
reserves for selection, conditionally on the
land being cleared of its vegetable vermin.
It is estimated that the population of N. S.
Wales increased by 40,000 during 1918—by
15,400 in the 185 square miles in and around
Sydney (83 extra per square mile), and
24,600 in the other 309,467 square miles (one
person gained to every 121 square miles).
The vigorous railway and. land settlement
policy is doing things all right.
The cotton industrv in Bananaland has
had a lift during the war. In 1914, when
the price of lint was 6d. per lb., the raw
cotton produced was 94451 b. Last year,
with the lint worth Is. Id., the output of
raw goods ran up to 166,4581 b. Which
recalls that Ipswich (Q.) started in the
ginning business in ’6l, during the American
Civil War. W’hen the scuffle was over and
de ole plantations got going again, Ipswich’s
little bit of enterprise perished. And Aus-
tralia hasn’t sufficient Protection to prevent
the same thing happening again.
When Prince John died the Colonial
Office cabled to the G.-G. that a month’s
mourning had been decided upon, and asked
him to pass the word along to the State
Governors. Upon receiving the intimation
from Munro Ferguson one or two of the
State rubber-stamps took umbrage and ex-
changed views upon the enormity of the
Colonial Office’s blunder in not communicat-
ing with each Excellency direct. But Gov-
ernments failed to warm up on the topic,
and suggested that it would be better to wait
till Milner, the new. Colonial Secretary, put
his foot in it overt something bigger—some-
thing with a wider appeal.
It’s known as the poet and telegraph
department now.
When the import of more than one motor-
body to every three chassis was prohibited
as a war measure, in order to conserve cargo
space, there sprang up several little body-
building works in Australia. One of them
in Sydney has made such progress that it
has i2O direct and a still greater number of
indirect employees. Most of these are
already* skilled workmen and are becoming
more skilled every month. But the war is
over and war-precaution measures are totter-
ing, and in a few months the chances are
that the foreign builders will have the
market re-opened to them; and then they
will proceed to give the promising Australian
infants the death-blow. Whereupon the
employees will have to look out for some
wood-and-water-joey job. It needn’t be so,
of course. There is absolutely no reason
why a single motor-body should be imported
to Australia. And no single one would be,
either, if the Federal Parliament put the
duty high enough.
A . breath of trouble has blown on the
Ryan Government in Queensland. The
Railway Workers’ Union Conference ‘ad-
vised all railway workers to consider the
advisability of demanding a 36-hours week
at the old 48-hours pay. Whereupon two
of them precipitated things by starting the
36-hours system and being suspended. This
sort of worry suggests that the Government
has raised more hopes than it knows what
to do with. It did a lot for the employees,
with the result that, though the freight
charges are the highest in Australia, the
loss of £1963 in 1915 became a loss of
£505.000 in 1916; £744,000 in 1917 and
£1,041,000 in 1918. (These are the
Treasury accounts; the Commissioners’
accounts, of course, don’t wholly agree.) In
other words, the interest earned on loan
capital got down to less than £1 9s. per cent.
If the wage bill is increased by one-third on
top of the previous concessions it will be a
cold day for the Treasury. Yet some of the
workers are amazed at their own modera-
tion. for the 30-hours week is the latest
idea).
The N. S. Wales Government seems hope-
lessly divided on the question of helping the
returned soldier to start vine-growing. One
story is that in no other rural industry can
the Digger get so much assistance from the
merchant or middleman who handles his
goods. But no wonder. The wine merch-
ant can’t get enough stuff to handle simply
because the water-waggon party proposes to
make vineyards next door to valueless, and
the merchant simply has to offer very special
inducements. Vine-growing ought to be a
great business in Australia; but it is only
fair to the Digger to point out to him that
the special inducements he sees are only held
out because of the special dangers. They
are the tot of rum handed out before the
hop-over.
In Tic. official circles it is thought that
Treasurer McPherson will retire from public
life at the end of 1920 —or sooner, if some-
thing occurs to expedite a general election,
lie has given politics a fair chance, and they
simply won’t fascinate him.
There is doubt in Maoriland, even in the
House of Reps., as to whether Massey or
Ward is top dog. When the session was
closing, prior to Plain Bill and Frilled Joe
moving back to Europe they both handed
toffee to the Speaker and Chairman of Com-
mittees. In returning thanks the Speaker
addressed himself first to the Minister for
Finance (Ward) and then to the Premier
(Massey). The Chairman of Committees,
for his part, reversed the order. Of course
Massey and Ward know the exact position.
At least, they both think they do.
One of the most obscene of the many-
degraded quarantine regulations is the dic-
tum that persons coming to infected Victoria
from the clean State of Tasmania may not
proceed to their homes in the country, but
must remain three days in ’flu-ridden Mel-
bourne. The Melbourne citizen, who has
already had a good chance to get the com-
plaint, can go all over the State if he is so
minded.
In the struggle to put off the evil day the
debt-laden S. Aus. Government has appointed
a tribunal “to deal with all matters of differ-
ence as regards wages and conditions of
employment between the Government and
its daily-paid employees.” The tribunal
will consist of the President or Deputy-
President of the Industrial Court, with
assessors representing the interests of the
parties before it. But it will only recom-
mend. the recommendations to be taken into
consideration in preparing the next esti-
mates. Nobody has heard any Government'
employees cheering.
“G.D.M.”: This invasion of prohibition
spruikers looks like a breach of hospitality.
Our drink question ought to be no concern
of strangers from other countries. The
abolition of liquor is a purely domestic prob-
lem to be answered by the Australians them-
selves. Here is a suggested solution. Make
every man or woman who wants a drink, or
a bottle or a hogshead, procure a license and
pay 2s. 6d. for it. No license, no drink. Fine
for supplying, either giving or selling, a drink
or a bottle of drink to any person without a
license, first offence £250 ; second offence loss
of license. The State would derive a big
revenue, and a drunkard would become
nearly an impossibility, while the habitual
drunkard who makes home a hell and hurts
the women and kiddies would be deader than
Julius Dodo.
LIBERTY.
“Russian women declared property of State.
Wba: Bolshevism means.” — Cable headings.
THE BOLSHEVIK: “Now, this is freedom.”
It sounds incredible, but the S. Aiis. Law
Society has thanked the Attorney-General
for giving it an opportunity of perusing Bills
introduced to Parliament, on the ground that
it is “of the highest importance to the com-
munity that these measures should receive
the careful consideration of the profession,
so that the best possible suggestions for
perfecting them may be available to the
Government.”
HALF-PRICIK.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“War-books half-price.”— Any bookseller’s window.
War-books half-price! llow swiftly did it run,
The tale of shame and men and mighty deeds!
The strife is over and the victory won ;
And now that all is past, who reads, who reads ?
Theirs were not half-price watchings in the night,
Nor half-price graves amid the Flemish mud.
But men forget, forget—nor were it right
To drench their growing souls in thoughts of
blood.
War-deeds half-price. Ah, well, it needs must be.
Harvest to harvest speaks a world’s increase.
What matter so the ransomed nations see
The full-price glory of a lasting peace !
li-S."'.. RIMU.
It appears that President Wilson’s League
of Nations is to have three weapons against
States that break the peace:—-
(1) It will cut off diplomatic relations with the
offender. That was the implement that Bolivia,
Uruguay and Sanfo Domingo squashed Germany with
in the late trouble.
(2) It will declare an economic boycott. France,
Roumania, Serbia, Belgium, Egypt, Portugal, Mon-
tenegro, the British Empire, Russia, China, the
United States, Brazil and a few other places, with
Siam backing them up, tried that method on Ger-
many, and after 41 years it was hard fighting that
did the trick, after all.
(3) Having no revenue or forces of its own the
League will finally sool its members on the enemy
at their own expense, shouting “Go it, Towzer!”
Trade with Germany after the war? Cer-
tainly not! Listen to the official Common-
wealth correspondent telling about the visits
of Aussie and other officers to the Rhine: —
The Cologne shops are well stocked and are doing
a flourishing trade among the British, especially in
cameras and photographic materials, which are extra-
ordinarily cheap compared with England and France.
Many officers are buying cameras in order to re-sell
them in England at handsome profits.
And Australia is still dawdling along with-
out adequate tariff protection, bluffed by
two yarns: (1) That Germany won’t have
anything to sell us; (2) that we wouldn’t
buy it if it had.
There isn’t an industry that is too insig-
nificant to be worth the help of a tariff,
because the establishment of one invariably
means giving a lift to another, and the other
gives a lift to a third, and so the chain goes
on. To help silver-lead smelting in Aus-
tralia the Broken Hill Prop, opened up
Iron Knob. With Iron Knob opened up the
co. reckoned it might as well start making
iron and steel. To make iron and steel it
needed coke. In producing 14,695 tons of
coke last month it also produced 218 tons of
sulphate of ammonia. In one week lately it
turned out 5038 tons of steel, and worked
the product into rails, plates (which means
shipbuilding), rods, etc. Now it is nearly
ready to draw wire; and, alongside,
Lysaght’s have just started to erect a gal-
vanised-iron plant.

“Pick”: “Musketoon” (B. 30/3/’!!))
lobbed upon the right conclusion when he surmised
that the parent kookaburras had murdered their
caged offspring. Wild birds will always feed their
imprisoned brood if allowed access to the cage, but
a.ter a few meals, the babies invariably die sud-
denly. If, however, the parents be caged with their
family and have suitable food supplied, they will
feed the brood without harm resulting. Also, I
have known several instances, particularly with
butcher-birds, where old birds in a cage fed and
reared young birds that did not belong to them,
an ! on one occasion I had a diamond-sparrow that
reared a nest of young canaries whose mother had
been slain by rats.
“Paul Cupid ’: I learned how to start a
jibbing horse the other flay. A Chow’s cart, loaded
with vegetables, was pulled into the water-table to
let a team pass. 'When John wanted to proceed
the moke refused to listen to him, though the
Chinkee coaxed and cursed in two languages, and
emphasised his remarks with a vigorous whip. The
teamster came to the rescue. “Get a hold of the
reins,” he said, “and I’ll soon shift him.” He took
some water from his water-bag and, while the heathen
stood up in the middle of his vegetables with a
rein in each hand, leaning forward expectantly, the
teamster poured a pint into the jib’s ear. With a
snort and a mighty plunge the beast went forward.
The Chow, being- unprepared for the manoeuvre, fell
over the tail of the cart. In three seconds all that
could be seen was a long line of miscellaneous vege-
tables leading from the prostrate Confucian to a
travelling cloud of dust.

“FY7” : Re those wild pigs of “Gouger’s”
(B. 30/1 ’ 19) which he wants, to turn to profitable
account, what’s the matter with mustering and
droving them to market? In the early ’nineties,
when the Balonne country in S.-W. Queensland
carried almost more pigs than sheep, an ancient bird
with a supply of hard-case dogs got permission from
the Australian Pastoral Co. to take every pig he
cculd off tile co.’s river runs. He got a big mob
together (it was a good season and they were
hog-fat) and after nursing them in the' river-
bends for a week to get them quiet, started off to
propel them down the Barwon. The last I saw of
him he was fading away across the plain at Curra-
willinghi in a cloud of dust and squeals. How he
go; on I never heard.
THE SUPPORTING PILLAR.
RINKS (sociably) : “I—hic—alwaysh hold it up ash shinin’ light, Jonesh, ole chap ”
JONES (strictly sober) : "it'm! Well, don’t mistake me for a Manley lamp-post."
irank R.”: “Moonyah” (B. 16/1/’l9)
doubts the statement that “alligators” (crocodiles')
make four- and six-mile trips overland, and wants
evidence. Here it is. Lee and sons were for many
3'ears engaged in trapping live crocs, in the Tully,
Johnstone and Proserpine rivers (N.Q.). On one
occasion they caught a big >un in the last-named
liver and decided to exhibit it in the township 12
miles away. No boat being available they decided
to drive the reptile overland. Ropes were attached
to its body and the party covered five miles the
hrs.. day. At night the exhibit was fastened to a
tree, but while the Lees were asleep it managed to
wriggle out of its tapes and the youngest son awoke
jus. m tune to feel it sniffing at his face. It was
again trussed up and the following day completed
the journey overland to Proserpine. Traps erected
by the Lees were always placed a considerable dis-
tance from the water. When the family first adopted
their unique profession they built a brush-fence
with a circular opening in the centre over which
was placed a strong noose. Within was tied a dog,
and when the bait began to bark the lizards loft
time in leaving the water and trekking towards
the trap. Jim Connallv, a cane cocky in the Proser-
pine district, missed several pigs from his farm,
which was about a mile from Kelsey Creek, a
notorious spot for crocodiles. Keeping a lookout
he came across a 12ft. saurian carrying away his
pork. Investigation showed that the reptile had
always followed the same track from the creek to
the farm.
* * * *
AN errimee”: Drovers’ waggonettes are
mostly rattletraps overdue for the scrap-heap. The
one which carried our dunnage and provender from
the Barcoo to Mungindi was patched from end to
end with rough timber, lashed with greenhide, ropes,
leather and dog chains, and there was enough wire
about it to fence a paddock. The brake dropped off
somewhere, and was not missed till we got info
hilly country. The driver invented a simple substi-
tute. A small tree was cut down wherever the ser-
vices of a brake were needed; it was man-hauled
to the middle of the road, and the butt-end secured
to the axle with a trace chain. The steeper the
gradient the bigger the brake we cut.
“Bill ID”: “Test’s” bird (B. 30/1/T9),
whose cry resembles a woman’s scream, is probably
the screech-owl of the South Coast (N.S.W.) ranges.
Heard in the jungles on a dark night, the yell is
a sure blood-freezer, and as it succeeds a “woosh-
woosh,” like the sound of a butcher’s cleaver at
work, many a hearer has imagined himself in the
neighborhood of a first-class tragedy. The ’bird is
a small, greyish owl, so inoffensive that he submits
uncomplainingly to all indignities from soldiers and
other small bush-birds that gather round to deal
out stoush to the sleepy stranger.
Jaymac”: The engine-driver at the
Pnde and Stringer was tortured at certain hours
nightly by a ghost or jim-jam, which pulled the
knocker line, sometimes signalling for the cage to
be sent down, then abruptly ordering it up again.
A close watch revealed the ghost. It was an opossum
which had developed a weakness for the scraps left
over from the platman’s crib. In climbing into the
sand room it landed heavily on the line, which gave
the signal to “send her down.” On climbing out
again lie touched the wire lightly and thus “gave
the oil ’ to haul up. A nail or two, some blasphemy
and a sheet of iron permanently laid the ghost.
* * * *
“Black Swan”: I think “E.M.W.” is a bit
mixed with reference to the mole-cricket (B.
30/l/’l9). The peculiar tracks under the surface
of beach sands of Westra.lia are not made by this
insect at all, but by the common sea-snail. In
•my 20 years in Westralia I have never seen the
mole-cricket on the beaches, although they are
very common in the Northern Territory and in North
Queensland.
“Mookingak” : -A recent dust-storm along
the edge of Cobham Lake (nor’-west N. S. Wales)
swept great numbers o: edekatoos oft the trees into
the water, and the ferocity of the wind prevented
them from rising. Next day over 200 were found
drowned on the opposite shore.
“K.IV’: There is another service which the
quandong renders if properly handled. When stewed
a thick syrup can be coaxed from the fruit, and this
as a medicine for young Bill's cold or sore throat
takes a front place in a lot of \competition.
“Bung”: Whoever told “Azac” (B.
23/1 / ’ 19) that the hare produces five young ones in
a litter might have gone one better, for I have found
her with six. They do not, however, increase like
rabbits because they do not burrow, and are
constantly exposed to enemies, the chief of
which are hawks and foxes. All the same, had
Azac been about Mahratta and Ashton stations
(N.S.W.) some years ago, when throughout the
winter, at organised hare-drives on Saturdays, from
500 to 1000 were destroyed, he would have concluded
that the hare was no slug in the matter of fecundity.
* * * *
“B.B.”: A unique specimen of the kiwi,
the practically wingless bird of Maoriland, was
run down and killed by a dog recently.
It was white, and I believe is the first of
that color to be caught. Commonly, the bird is
dark reddish-brown, striped with light yellowish-
brown, or a light greyish-brown barred with black.
** r * #
“Ida D.” : Re “D.F.’s” par. (B. 16/1/’l9), I
should consider “lubra” to be a borrowed word in
the Tassy abo. language, especially if used to mean
wife. Lubra is really a young unmarried female—or
perhaps it could be translated “sweetheart”—and 1
think Kendall applied it in the latter way when he
used the word in “The Last of His Tribe.” “Goon-
di-jeh is a word that means a married woman in
some of the Monaro (N.S.W.) dialects. In love-
making, “indigie-nihio-goomatha-moombi” is “Give
me a kiss ; that is the man speaking to the woman,
“indigie” being equivalent to our pronoun “you,”
and nihlo meaning “me,” the man.
“Aris”: I saw a rare bird yesterday, here
in Tenterfield (N.S.W.)—the kite-hawk 'of the
interior. He was all on his own, hovering over a
corn patch evidently hunting mice. I have never
seen one of these birds east of the Darling before,
or farther south than 300 miles from Adelaide. Out-
back they were always seen in flocks and used to
be known as Babbage’s chickens, as the yarn went
that they followed the explorer on his return from
his trip inland. They are regular camp-followers,
and pick up any scraps the cook throws out. They
are the cleverest birds at catching anything while
on the wing that I’ve ever seen. Many a time I’ve
watched the men throwing up scraps of food for the
kite to grab and he never failed to score as he
hovered over the dining-table.
“A.M.”: For pluck and determim. tion I
award the fern to a sheep-farmer in the backbloeks
of Maoriland. An illness in childhood left one leg
useless, and ever since he has had to walk with
crutches. Sheep-farming in rough country would
seem to be the last game for such a man; but he
farms 1000 acres successfully. His useless leg gives
him no grip at all on one side of his horse; but he
rides well and fearlessly, and keeps at it in spite of
occasional spills, his two crutches carried on his
aim. I saw him recently riding hard along a rough
and tortuous bush road. Just as he caught up with
our party his bridle came to pieces, and he finished
the journey without any bridle at all. Last saw him
disappearing at a hard canter round a bend in the
road, the remains of the bridle in one hand and his
crutches swinging out from the other arm.

‘ Bass” : A half-caste couple on an island
near Bass Straits wanted to get married, but the
local parson refused to do the job unless he was paid
£2 in advance. The stone-broke abo. set out to get
a loan, and finally called on the doctor (who is a
genial sort) and asked him for the loan of the
money, promising to pay it back in the near future.
Doc. shelled out, and Binghi, with his intended
missus, made for the pub, where they got gloriously
drunk. Jacky tried the medico for another loan next
morning, but this time he wanted security. “Orlite,”
said the black, “me give you baby bonus soon.”

Agricola ’: The large yellow-and-black
hornet which encloses small spiders in its nest for
the delectation of its expected family is common,
but in the Bega (N.S.W.) district there is a much
laiger hornet which seeks out a big grasshopper and
flie.-> cheerily away with him. I have not been able'
to track this hornet to its lair, but suspect it of
burying the grasshopper after laying an egg in the
back of his neck. Another hornet found near
.aluen (IVS-IN.) makes a hobby of collecting taran-
tulas. When the tarantula finds that he has been
discovered by the hornet, he throws himself on his
brc.v and tries to keep off the enemy by waving his
eg,-5 wildly at him. As soon as his foe gets inside
his guard he curls up and awaits the knock-out,
which is promptly forthcoming. He is then dragged
away to a patch of loamy soil and interred after the
egg-laying _ ceremony. A fearsome specimen is the
lornet which gets out after the big locusts in the
Hawkesbury district. The locust appears to fight
well, but it is mainly a buzzing of wings. He, also,
is buried with the usual honors.

ACROSS THE WARREGO.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I dreamt some dreams of dried-up streams,
Of streams that seldom flow,
Of men and things misfortune brings
To cross the Warrego ;
And I could see old faces there,
Old faces grim and set,
Old mates of mine, that tramped with me,
And. some are tramping yet.
And I dreamt then of other men
AIJ trudging to and fro,
With empty bags and cruel swags, _
To cross the Warrego ;
And most of them looked straight ahead,
A few were looking back;
The bush had claimed their souls and left
Their bodies on the track.
And in my sleep I saw the sheet)
And heard them bleating low,
The ringing flocks, the stringing flocks,
To cross the Warrego;
The young and strong were in the lead,
The old and weak behind,
With lagging feet and dragging feet,
And some of them were blind.
A drover’s hack came down the track
With mane and tail aflow,
And station hacks and station cracks,
To cross the Warrego ;
And some of them had brands I knew,
And others’ skins were clean ;
And some had carried colored silks
That I had often seen.
And in my dreams I saw the teams,
The teams I used to know,
The long, long teams, the strong, strong teams,
That crossed the Warrego ;
And lurching woolbales strained the ropes
That lashed them fore and aft,
And every ounce of horseflesh pulled
From leader to the shaft.
I dreamt of nights by campfire lights,
The flicker -and the' glow,
The great white moon, the black gin's croon,
Beyond the Warrego ;
And I could hear the bullock bells
Dong-dong across the plain,
And thirsty kangaroos loped in
And bounded out again.
And through the night I saw a light
. That crossed the Warrego—
The battered lights, the spattered lights.
The ligli'ts of Cobb and Co. ;
The coach went creaking through the sand
That skirts the rnulga ridge,
And Tattled down the stony track
That led towards the bridge.
And in the scrub I saw a pub—
The name I do not know,
But it was there to catch the cheques
That crossed the Warrego ;
A graveyard stood right out in front,
Two pepper-trees were near,
And goats were camping underneath
A skillion at the rear.
And in my dream a camel team
Was winding in and out,
With swaying packs and blistered backs,
The messengers of drought;
And as they crossed a sandy ridge
The sun went down below ;
I saw them on the skyline then
Beyond the Warrego.
And in the night I woke in fright,
My pulse was beating slow ;
I thought that I was on the road
Beyond the Warrego;
I thought a mirage danced ahead,
The dry plain at my back,
And I was trudging, trudging on,
Alone, along the track.

MISTRESS: “You wake up promptly, don’t
you, Alary Ann?"
The New Maid: “Oh, yes, mum. Just
gimme a dig and a couple of shakes.”
“Melos” :,I support “Umntu” (B. 23/1/T9)
in his contention that bees were introduced to Aus-
tralia prior to 1834, the date mentioned by “Mela-
leuca” (B. 17/10/’18). The Rev. Samuel Marsden,
writing to a friend in May, 1810, from Sydney,
stated: “You will be pleased to hear that our ves-
sel, the Ann, arrived safely in N. S. Wales after a
trip of 20 weeks....l landed five Spanish sheep,
presented to me by his Majesty. ... I also landed
two hives of bees which I found in Rio.” I believe
thai Gregory Blaxland imported a hive of European
bee? some years before this ; yet I do not think that
he claimed to be the first to introduce the insect to
this country.
ABOVE SUSPICION.
JIMMY: “You bin see gin belonga me?”
NEW-CHUM : “I’ve seen no gin.”
JIMMY ( suspiciously ) : “Baal plurry gammon?”
NEW-CHUM: “D — n it, man, I’m a teetotaller.”
“Centurion”: Veldt-sores and barcoo-rot
are one and the same. I’ve had ’em both on their
native heath, and the same thing again under the
name of “septic sores” in Egypt and Sinai. The
cause has been definitely traced to a bacillus which
infects the roots of the hairs. Till the diseased
hairs are plucked out it is almost impossible to get
a cure when food and climatic conditions are not
good. Military doctors made a great success of
the pulling-out process in Egypt and the desert.
There’s no pain in the operation.
* * * #
“Wandi” : Most dogs like hunting ’possums
at right, but you want to know the sort of dog
you’ve got before you go shooting the
marsupial whose address is up a tree.
There is the dog that barks at owls,
and at anything in hollow logs or in
burrows, whereas the respectable
’possum dog is required to have a
discriminating sense. Then there’s
the dog that barks only once at a
tree, and who, if not found in a few
minutes, will leave it to hunt for
another; the specialising dog, whose
bark indicates the 'nature of bis
quarry, as he speaks in one language
at a native cat, another at a ’possum,
a third at a snake, and so on;
there's the brute that becomes fran-
tically excited whenever he finds any-
thing, if it is only a jew-lizard or a
flying-mouse, and will yelp continu-
ously till morning if need be; and
there’s the fool mongrel that goes
two miles off, then sits barking
under a tree which has nothing in It,
and as Soon as you come up to him
trots off wagging his tail as though he
enjoyed the joke. Besides having
faith in your dog it is necessary for
the dog to have faith in you. If you
can’t see the ’possum that he has
discovered and pass on, or can’t Shoot
it when you do see it, the four-legged
hunter becomes a disgusted animal, and after a
time will chuck the job and leave you to find your
own ’possums.
* * * *
“Bart”: Anybody seen a white waratah?
There’s a legend on the West Coast of Tasmania
that there is such a thing, and I saw one tree with
white blooms. But it might have been an albino.
Anyway, it was a genuine waratah, and not the
stinkwood flower which we used sometimes to call
white wqratah.
“Snell” I Wilber Was a Bungaree potato-
grower when the Ace of Spades started at Bragh,
and the extraordinary possibility of earning a bit of
money regular so won upon him that he forsook the
casual pursuits of a grower of edible roots and be-
came a handy man at the Ace. Eventually, when th&
Ten of Spades, the King of Spades, and the Joker got
going, Wilber became charcoal-burner to the bunch.
Dinny Wilber did not know much about the art of
securing the greatest quantity of coal from the
smallest allowance of wood, but he was very ener-
getic. He felled trees (already rung), cut them into
suitable proportions, stacked them in heaps, piled
sods upon them, and fired‘the core. Then at inter-
vals he carried buckets of water from the dam and
drenched his kiln. But somehow it often happened
that in the morning the roof was found caved in, and
a very small proportion of charcoal rewarded the
operator. Late one night, after a long, hard, hot
day spent in collecting and covering an unusually
large “burn,” little Wilber went along to inspect the
pile. He found a great piping flame illuminating
the bush, and a fat, sponge-footed sundowner sitting
at a reasonable distance,, smoking happily. They say
Dinny Wilber leapt 9ft. 9in., uttering a howl like a
maddened Red Indian beset by hornets. Then he
hurled himself at the fell destroyer, and fought him
much as a thresher fights the mouse that gets in-
volved in its works. The man’s shrieks brought
assistance while Wilber was still struggling to ram
his carcase into the aperture he had made in the
kiln. Dinny Wilber, taken to court by the contused
victim, danced in the presence of an august Bungaree
Bench, and shrilled only one sentence: “The gaudy
swine he sez to me, ‘What,’ sez he, ‘do you be-
grudge a bloke a light for his pipe?” Forty shillings
or seven days.

“M.A.T.” : This will prevent a cow from
sucking herself. Put a halter on her and .fasten
a strap around her body about half way between
the hips and shoulders. Run a pole about 4ft. 6in.
long between her forelegs and fasten the front end
to the rope ring of the halter. Tie the other end
to the belt so that it hangs about six inches below
the cow’s belly.
* * * *
“W.A.C.”: When strangles, an epidemic
, hose symptoms resemble those of Spanish ’flu, is
raging amongst Cocky’s horses, he claps on Dobbin a
.iose-bag containing steamed eucalyptus gum-leaves.
'W hen the patient kicks against being muzzled pneu-
monia generally settles the argument.
* * * *
“Trapper” : Re the argument concerning
the question as to whether rabbits will jump 36-inch
netting. They have been known to jump 42-inch.
The one thing a landholder doesn’t want to do is
to chase any rabbits inside his fence with a dog.
If the excited bunny leaps the wires and escape*
a large army of hurdlers will develop. Forty-two-
inch netting is only about 36-inch when erected and
heeded in the ground, but being a true-blue con-
servative, bunny doesn’t try to leap it usually be-
cause grandfather never did it. Under the stress
of deadly fear, however, he is liable to become
progressive. In one case a man had 2ft. netting
round his cultivation paddock for years, with full
satisfaction, till one night he forgot to shut the
gate. Next day, finding an army corps of bunnies
inside, he closed the gate and set the dog on. Several
leaped the wire, and since then there has been
a steady development In the number of leppers In
the local rabbit fraternity, and the only reason
they don’t eat the cocky's crop is that he has given
up putting any in.
“Melos” : Binghi in early days had an ex-
cellent substitute for bread in a species of fern,
bungwall or dingawa, which he found growing in
marshy places. The root, after being washed, was
pounded between stones, then mixed with sufficient
water to make a stiff paste and baked as a damper.
The finished article was something like'biscuit in
flavor, and more sustaining than most breads turned
out by white brother. Binghi was well provided for in
many other ways. His pharmacology, although not
extensive, was sufficient for most needs. Among the
Northern Rivers (N.S.W.) tribes the juice of
crab-tree leaves was employed in colic and allied
complaints, and the milky substance found in the
fleshy leaves of a plant found in brush forests pro-
vided a remedy for ulcerated sores. Incidentally, I
have seen this “milk” achieve wonderful results in
cases of rodent ulcer. An infusion of hickory bark
was employed in treating skin diseases generally.
The blacks used pellets of this bark for stupefying
fish. The dope was placed in a bait, and then
thrown into the water without any attachment. For
rheumatism the bruised leaf of cungevoi and the sap
of the bloodwood were both used externally. Honey
was considered the best thing for colds. Sick or
well, the abos. have a fondness for honey, especially
when it is served on the under-surface of stringy -
bark. This rind has a pleasant flavor, and to get
the most of it, black brother ravels a strip of the
inner part, which he then dips in the honey and
transfers to his mouth.
* * #
“Ivobbi” : Does the scrub-turkey spread the
seeds of the prickly-pear ? Instructor Brookes, of
Bananaland’s Agricultural Dept., who was ordered to
investigate, says it does not. He reported (1) the seeds
were in practically every instance crushed in- the
powerful gizzard; (2) the very few that do escape
the tight squeeze there will not germinate. So the
Minister for Agriculture has refused to lift the
pixtection which the scrub-turkey enjoys.
“Lantana” : An iron bark girder brought
into Kyogle (N.S.W.) from Back Creek was recently
regarded as being about the biggest thing in
dressed twigs seen there. It was 40ft. long by 24in.
square.
* * * *
“Musketoon”: In the early part of the
summer, Pat Glynn, a drover, of Forbes (N.S.W.),
started from that place with 5000 sheep, bound for
Ram’s Head, Kosciusko. Excepting the jumbucks
used for meat on the trip, there was no shortage
on arriving at the big mountain. When he reached
Kiandra Glynn was informed by old inhabitants that
the tail-end of the trip had never previously been
undertaken without a local guide, but the drover
wasn’t scared. The country is about the roughest
in Australia, but Glynn, steering a course by the
sun, arrived within half a mile of Ram’s Head.
* * * *
“J.”: Apropos twins amongst the abos.
In the Islands a case is reported of a woman at
Moa paralysing her friends by presenting hubby
with a quartette of infants on one occasion. (Dad
was properly paralysed, too!) The arrival of twins
is generally looked upon with a pained expression,
and in the old days one of the newcomers would
have been dumped alive into a hole in the beach.
In some of the isles, the local medicine-man is held
to be responsible, his plan
being to twist a piece of
creeper round the neck of
a figure bearing the name
of the woman. Occasion-
ally, also, the fact of the
lady having touched a
certain plant was held to
be the cause of her in-
discretion.

There was no shadow on the land,
No cloud in heaven’s dome,
When, bearded man and beardless boy,
Our hearts alight with morning joy,
Across the hills of Duckmaloi
We drove the cattle home.
The sunlight danced a merry jig
On grass and bracken brown,
And right and left, and left and right,
The magpies piped in sheer delight,
As over creekside flat and height
We drove the cattle down.
With fiery eyes and tossing horns,-
And swaying sides and hips,
They moved —red hides and hides of black—
And ever, as they left the track,
We wheeled, and held, and drove them back
With shouts and cracking whips.
There is no joy in all the world
Of such a bloom and blush
As that the charging rider feels
When, at some frenzied scrubber’s heels,
His stockwhip making curves and wheels,
He thunders through the bush.
Knees gripping hard, he dashes on,
The swift wind in his hair ;
Whate’er befall, whate’er betide,
All thought of peril thrust aside,
He feels the glory and the pride
Of those who greatly dare.
The moving mob vyas mountain-reared
And mountain-bred and born,
Their hides of brand and marking clear —-
As shy as deer, as swift as. deer
Who over heath and highland hear
The early huntsman’s horn.
And yet, with dog and spur and whip,
Our horses flaked with foam,
The magpies singing all the while,
Through hour and hour and mile and mile,
For all their speed-of-hoof and guile,
We brought the cattle home.
A score of years has passed away,
Slow filing on, since then,
And Time, who knows no sparing ruth,
And Wisdom armed with bitter truth,
Have tamed the heart of reckless youth,
And greyed the beards of men.
We may not hold the hands of Time,
The days of old restore.
And though our present bliss be pure,
Yet in the future shines a lure
That draws us on and on, for sure,
To test what lies before.
Yet evermore, when cattle low
Across the bracken brown,
I see again that man and boy
As when, alight with morning joy,
Across the hills of Duckmaloi
They drove the cattle down.

ing. the' moments of study, rehearsal and
acting we abdicate ourselves to be other
individuals, partly indicated by the script,
but revived as complete personalities by our-
selves. Thus an actor is said “to create” a
part; and it may radically differ from the
creation of the same part by another good
actor. Conscious reason has little share in
these . creations; and his personation may
surprise the actor himself as much as his
audience. A new personality has possessed
him. For only the time being, as he thinks, has
he surrendered himself. But that is not so.
The habit of surrender increases, so that in
time he becomes the lodging-house of his
creations, a character without stability. Not
that a Hamlet on the stage is Hamlet off it;
but some part of the character as inter-
preted blends with the interpreter.
The amateur actors (at long intervals)'
of the Passion Play are alleged to be speci-
ally moral persons. It may be so; but if
their acting is of the highest class, and they
create angels, it can, theoretically, only
be done at the cost of their moral injury.
For it is the action of revival that is harm-
ful. In private life an old heavy may be
better than an old lead. Innocent virtue is
effectively acted on the stage by one who is
a Phryne off it. There appears to be some
law of contrast operating, so that the more
exalted the sentiments of the actor on the
stage the meaner he is off it. In our ances-
tral past are many experiences and person-
alities. Emotion revives them ; as in passion,
drunkenness, excitement and cases of dual
and more personalities. Lower-life forms
are entirely dominated by these past experi-
ences, and we name it instinct. With great
stress man has partly emerged from this
condition; but he can revert with startling
rapidity. This is the pit of circumstance
waiting for the actor or actress. In degree
the actor is in the position of the spiritual-
ist medium of whom Rupert says: “The
majority in the IT.S.A. end in the asylum or
the gaol,” so. disastrous may be the result of
vacating self-direction even for a few hours
a day.
The vast reservoir of sub-consciousness is
what instinct, in its many manifestations,
draws on. And for the power a price is
paid ; for, reviving one sub-conscious memory,
we automatically revive other memories
associated with it. Perhaps in our vast
hereditary past morals held a small place;
or, it may be, they are less easily revived.

The book is good in its class and will be liked bv
girls a good deal older than Phyl.
Walking Shadows, by Alfred Noyes (Cassell and
Co.). Alfred Noyes has written verse and
criticism ; this is. his first venture into the realm of
story-telling. It is not a specially brilliant entrance ;
but the yarns are readable in their way. They are
things of war-time, and the color isn’t particularly
attractive ; but a lot of worse stuff is being read.
The Course of My Ship, by Gertrude Page and R.
A. Foster-Melliar (Cassell and Co.). Partly by
narrative, partly by correspondence which passes
between the chief actors in the story, a yarn of a
poet’s love for a nice girl is worked out to a satis-
factory finish. The poet has a garden ill England
and the lady, is in Rhodesia. Also, the poet has dis-
tinguished himself in the war; and so deserves all
he 1S more than thls 111 14; for the book

The Navy Eternal, by “Bartimeus” (Hodder and
Stoughton). A rattling good book about the fleet,
)) ith aa , ] °ok-in at the “navy-that-flies” and the
ithKh
there is no hint or pretence of fine writing, excellent
pictures of the doings of the men who maintained
the blockade are presented. As good as any recent
war book -
Little England, bv Sheila Kaye-Smith (Nisbet and
Co.). A simple tale of Sussex and the war. The
yarn revolves around a Particular Baptist parson, who
ou ? bt to have followed his former trade of black-
™nth .and who had destroyed his social standing by
marrying a gipsy girl. Jerry, his black-eyed lad,
dies at the Front. The men and women in the tale
are heavy and loutish, speaking a strange, rude dia-
lect; but they have some of the hero stuff in them,
A book not entirely dependent on war interest,
Three Years of World Revolution, by Paul Hensch,
a leader of the Socialist party in the Reichstag
(Constable and Co., London). It was finished in
a . time of exaltation, when Russia had become a
JfftSg-yff'S.Ki
sinking’, and the United States troops had barely
begun to arrive. Hensch declares that expansion
v-as Germany’s long-recognised destiny ; yet with
all this talk of the need for more room, he asserts
that Germany alone stood for the policy of “no
annexatl(yns. ,, He doesn t even say much about
social reform, but he alleges that Germans are
dashed proud of being barbarians. “Only bar-
barians are capable of rejuvenating a world that
is suffering from a decaying civilisation.” Alto-

U-boat Devilry, by C. It. Bateman (Hodder
and Stoughton), is a collection of stories
abou * things that were done to and done by mer-
chant seamen during the war. They tell of much
adventure and much heroism, but there is very
little devil in them. They rather suggest the
destruction of Pompeii or the storming of Jerusalem
written in the style of an Argus leader. Even the
best episode in which a becalmed French sailing
vessel keeps 11 p her end in a fi^ht with a Hun sub "
marine doesn’t make the author really excited.
Plenty of men coulcl get more frenzy out of a
mouse-fight.
My Life of Adventure by A . G. Hales (Hodder
and Stoughton). The title is a misprint. Fox-
“adventure” read “invention.” As an effort of the
imagination it is not without its merits; it is
raci K written, as all Hales’s 23 novels are.
The Boardman Family, by Mary S. Watts (Mac-
millan’s, New York). There is excellent character-
isation in this stoiy of a girl who, tiring of the
inanities of an utterly respectable and well-to-do
American home, decided to do something. Of
course she did it amazingly well, with the help of
a manager who was taking her to Europe to marry
ber (everything was still most proper) when a
? crman , torpedo providentially intervened. It
d !'°wned him, leaving her for the right man who
" as waiting at the other end.
The Inky Way
This is the tribute paid to Bean, Aus-
tralia’s official war correspondent, by a man
who was with the Australians from the first
scrap in Gallipoli almost to the armistice.
The speaker was Dr. T. Fiasclii, jun., who
proposed “The Press” at a dinner given to
the Parliamentary Country by the
wine-growers of the Hunter (N.S.W.) :
I want to tell you about Bean, the Australian
correspondent. There is not a gamer man in the Aus-
tralian army, and the Australian army is the gamest
in the world. Bean has 30 feet of intestines, and
every inch is guts. He has been in all the front
lines where the Australians have been. There ought
to have been more pressmen like him with the Aus-
tralians. You people here did not know a fraction
of what you should'have known about our doings.
That was not Bean’s fault. He was hampered by
restrictions, but if there had been 10 or 12 other
pressmen with us it would have been much better
for the a.t.f.
Fiaschi' added that in France the Anzac
Corps was known as the corps that never
gave a yard of ground.
Died in a military hospital at Boulogne,
Cecil Chesterton, brother of G.lv. He had
been serving with the Highland Light In-
fantry since 1910, and exposure in the
trenches killed him at 39. Cecil was founder
and editor of the New Witness, and had
written several books, including “Party and
People,” “Nell Gwynne” and “Gladstonian
Ghosts.” His wife, “John Keith Prothero,”
writes novels.
“Adelaide”: Claude Beresford, whose book
of sea-verses gets brief mention in B.
23/1/Y9, is chiefly remarkable for his
facility. Every Sunday, in Adelaide Mail,
he produces a couple of long strings of verse,
As “Seebee” he writes in English, as “An-
tonio di Seebee” in the steaka-da-oyst Dago
dialect of the stage. And the astonishing
thing is the high standard he is able to keep
up.

of Sergeant Joyce Kilmer, of the U.S.
Forces, who was killed in action last
autumn at 31. Kilmer was on the New
York Times and edited the poetry page
of the Literary Digest, wrote poetry and
lectured about it. I remember hearing him
recite his own verse (which is the custom in
the IRS.) at a gathering of poets and
authors in a highbrow New York club. There
was nothing “bohemian” about the appear-
anee of these ink-slingers ; men and women
wore full regalia and looked sleek and
affluent. John Masefield, who was the
first on the bill, read some of his own in
such a funereal manner as to bring gloom
illto the , g la( ¥ bSt heart, and lie coupled the
e r with a decided Johnny accent.
® dwin Markham brought a wluft of piney
Western air with him. His was the only
unconventional figure there. Followed the
fresh-faced, boyish Joyce Kilmer. Appa-
r®ntly oblivious to the crowd, he wandered

There was something m his easy, direct

While some of the best-known English

have been running to 16 and 24 pages. The

gard to printing paper what it did for Aus-
tralia with regard to wheat: bv limiting
export it snowed the country under the out-
put of the pulp mills. - New York Sunday
editions have been throwing a hundred pages
at defenceless readers; and there are at
least half a dozen offices in that one city
which have been eating up over 000 tons of
paper per week apiece. The thing came
t° look like a scandal at last when Uncle
am was priding himself that he was cutting
down on everything but essential war work,
and tbe Government not only said there

over all the paper-mills to make sure there

so cheap that the price hardly mattered, pub-
lishers had encouraged advertisers to take
va f acreages of space at ridiculously low
I,&tes and for long periods ; and the con-
tracts remained while the paper whereon to
print the vast acreages disappeared. It has
been a trying time for publishers; but the
lesson it has taught them will benefit readers
— they won’t in future have to hire a truck
to carry the evening paper home.

POINT
“Norbell”: The late Ned Hollo-
way, of the booming voice, arrived
with his co. at Newcastle too late
for a band rehearsal. Before the
overture the conductor of the local
orchestra interviewed Ned as to
music cues. Elocuting like the
■ ghost in Hamlet, Ned instructed
him: “Laddie, never mind cues.
When you see George Melville—he
was the comedian —play ‘Beer,
Beer, Glorious Beer!’ When
Mrs. Holloway comes on, play
something gentle—tweedle-eedle-
eedle-eedle-00, like the ‘Gipsy’s
Warning.’ When in doubt play a
plaintive. And whenever you catch
sight of me, give ’em plenty of
brass and drum.”
Apropos the decision of the
Actors’ Association in England to
turn itself into a trade-union.
Sydney Valentine, the chairman,
seems to have converted nearly all waverers,
at the final meeting, by reading out “an
iron-bound £2-a-week contract lately enforced
by a London manager, a contract fit only for
Russian serfs.”
“Stargazer” : William Holloway—“ Plain
Bill”—was running a Shakspearean season
at Melbourne Bijou, and not doing any too
well. He was in attendance at the booking
department of a local music-seller one after-
noon, when a small, be-spectacled, woolly
man entered. The customer addressed Hol-
loway. “This the box-office, sir?” said he.
“Yes, certainly.” “For Holloway’s?” “Yes,”
the actor-manager replied with great
urbanity. “Well,” said the simple stranger,
“will you please give me a box?” “With
the greatest pleasure,” William assured him.
Then the conversation became more inti-
mate, and suddenly a startling change came
over the great Holloway. He seized the
be-spectacled innocent, hustled him with
unnecessary energy off the premises, and
came back dusting his fingers. “The infer-
nal ass,” said Plain Bill—“he wanted pills!”
Dear Bulletin, — Apropos par. bv “Haka”
(B. 26/12/T8) concerning our play,
“Kitty Nobody,” and the part played by Bob
Hreig in its production. Mr. Greig is en-
titled to full credit for his perspicacity in
picking a success by merely reading the script
and for his courage in backing his opinion of
a local article with good hard cash; but
before that H. 11. Champion, of the Aus-
tralasian Authors’ Agency, Melbourne, saw
sufficient merit in the play to make him en-
thusiastic. He bached his opinion with
shoe-leather, cheerfully taking on the heart-
breaking task of trudging from manager to
HOSTILITIES SUSPENDED.

might become infected with his enthusiasm.
Fortunately for the shoe-leather he struck
Bob Greig early.—Yours, John Patrick

“Private Boxer”: The stage people are
getting work. For instance, some of J. C.
Williamson’s pantomime girls, headed by
this season’s "boy,” are taking lessons in
nursing. It’s an ill wind that blows nobody
any good. Some of these capable damsels
will doubtless find their vocations.
CONSOLATION.
D RAMATIST: “Somebody remarked that, of
all Australian authors, I am most like
Ibsen.”
FRIEND “Don't get wild, old chap. They
meant your face, not your work.”
“II.H.”: “Reptile Enters Bedroom” is a
frequent heading these days, the drought
having driven the snakes into country towns
m search of refreshment. There is nothing
new about it. I was a dramatic critic for
over 20 years, and the entry of the evening-
dress reptile into the heroine’s bedroom was
so common that it made me yawn. Why
don’t heroines fasten the door and keep out
the reptile?
In America “The Boy” has been broad-
ened for Broadway and christened “Good
Morning, Judge.” The crowds who were
lately watching the farce in New York
beheld an old J.C.W. charmer, Eileen C.ot-
tey, close up in the front row.
English theatre-managers are as sheepy
as ever. lor years nearly every musical
comedy had to be a Girl of some sort.
s , had just enough originality to start
a Maid of the Mountains.” She has been
an enormous success, and just before Christ-
mas topped the “Merry Widow’s” record of
‘‘B performances at that house. So
already a Maid of the South is announced,
and in the distance there’s a Maid of the
Desert.
Norbell”: Not long ago I saw “Within
uie Raw done very well indeed at far-west
Cunnaimilla (Q.), amongst the
sand, goats and hot-water bores,
and with the thermometer at
105 deg. or so. In the first act,
Gilder’s private office in N’Yark,
the acetylene plant went on
strike, and after a few smellful
splutters every light in the place
expired, leaving the autocratic
Gilder and his typiste in dark-
ness. After a few minutes’
pause, the hand of Fate appeared
at the prompt entrance, bearing
a lighted kerosene lamp. Gilder
crossed L, and accepted the offer-
ing with a muttered “Thank
you!” and with the feeble
illumination the act proceeded to
its close. The tense situation
at the end of Act 2, where Mary
Turner hits Gilder in the midriff
with the announcement of her
marriage to his son, was slightly
marred by the lady swallowing
a large moth which had been
fluttering round the lamp. But
in spite of these distractions it
was voted a jolly good show by
the packed and perspiring audi-
ence of shearers, squatters,
sheepdogs and tick inspectors.
“Orchest”: “Tito” refers to
Romberg’s “Toy Symphony” (B.
13/2/’l9). There are two
“Toy Symphonies,” Romberg’s
and one composed by Haydn.
Too little use is made of
this very interesting and simple form of
orchestral music. The instruments used
are merely “toys,” consisting of trumpets
(of the penny variety), rattles, cymbals, etc.,
augmented by strings and piano. I have
heard both symphonies performed with huae
success.
Camelero : At Colombo on the way home
we found that in the way of outdoor enter-
tainment the place had nothing better to
offer than the snake-charmer and fakir. A
half-starved Indian equipped with a mon-
goose and a bag of snakes would
arrive and offer to sell Billjim a rep-
tile for a rupee, the mongoose to
destroy it for the amusement of the pur-
chaser. When the snake was placed on
the ground the mongoose would begin to
prance, his eyes turning red with the light
of battle and his teeth chattering savagely.
YV ith lightning-like rapidity he would pounce
on the snake, and catching it at the back of
the head shake and batter it as a terrier
does a rat. Unless Billjim kept his eye
on the performance the Indian would re-
capture the snake before it was killed, so
that he could re-sell it and have it almost
killed over and over again for other cus-
tomers. It was a tame show for all but
the snake.
I red and Herbert Walton, in the tem-
porarily-suspended “Goody Two Shoes,” at
Melbourne Majesty’s, are uncle and nephew,
and until recently had not met for 20
years. But there is no family likeness
between the silent wonder of Fred’s panto-
mime and the fussy futility of Herbert.
Oscar Asclie, celebrating the 1000th per-
formance of “Chu Chin Chow” at His
Majesty’s, London, told an interviewer that
it looked like running another two years.
Arthur Whitby, in Australia with 11. B
Irving, has been the hit of J. Bernard
lagan’s artistic production of “Twelfth
Night” at the London Court. Whitby's
loby Belch is described as a “flawless piece
of acting.”

Take us back to mellerdrarmer, more than twenty
years ago,
When our faith was yet untainted and the “gods”
still ran the show ;
When She wasn’t Bought and Paid For (you can bet
yet blarsted life!)
And the only lies we knew of were the Lies he Told
his Wife.
(Or the lies he told his friend’s wife just to set that
lady right,
As to who her husband was with—as to where he
stayed last night;
To corroborate a cobber in the sinful Days of Drink,

Take 11s back to mellerdrarmer, nearly thirty years
ago,
When the things we saw were real and the rest we
didn’t know;
When we never dreamed that sweethearts (not the
dead flat things on screens)
Ever slapped each other’s faces when they got
behind the scenes.-
When the hero was a hero, and the heroine his
“life,”
And the good stage never hinted at the pair’s
domestic strife; -
At the dirty private problem or the great eternal
nag—
But I prose. The gods arc whistling. “Cut it out!
Up witli the rag!”
Send us back to mellerdrarmer, for our hearts are
simple yet,
And, in spite of Her Confession, ’tis the Man who

And the local drunk who helped her in the depths of

Our More Sinned against than Sinning (though the

Just how many beans made seven—and the villain

With his card-case, mo. and nail-knife, and his

With two likely souls to fix ’im—Mother Snark and

Let her cry: “I will, I must know!” Likewise:
“He is in-no-eent!”

CURABILITY, which is the first essential for a Roof
_Jj|j Covering, is absolutely assured by using MALTHOID.
MALTHOID has been tested in general use in Australia
and New Zealand for the past 14 years, and its reputation is
established on the results it has given in actual use.
There is a tendency to associate other materials with MALTHOID
because they look the same. This is not in the best interests of the
user, as the durability of MALTHOID is due .to the ingredients used
and to the special methods employed in the manufacture.
I is not the same as
others.

MALTHOID was not the first roofing of its kind offered for sale in Australia, but
it has always been sold as different from anything else, and has demonstrated the differ-
ence claimed for it with the first roll sold in actual practice. Equal quality and value
are not procurable under any other name.
MALTHOID’S most enthusiastic supporters to-day are those who have at some
time used something else because it looked the same.
When purchasing Roofing, users should remember in their own best interests that
MALTHOID is different. A cheap Roofing to buy is a dear Roofing to use.
Actual samples and illustrated booklets are obtainable from Malthoid agents in every district throughout
Australia and New Zealand, or will be sent, post free on request, from

“Smith”: Does anyone hnow who and
what was the one woman who landed on

me she was a Red Cross matron “or some-
thing.”
Norway has been experimenting in the
extraction of salt from ocean water by

A big firm building silos in this district em-
ploys a German as boss of the gang erecting
poles, rigging, etc. lie is not naturalised
and is compelled to report to the police at

Soldiers being discontented. Can you won-
der at it?
“Gleniris”: If no “profiteering” is going
on it is up to the butchering business to
explain why beef and mutton should be only
a fraction cheaper to-day, retail, than was
the case in early spring. Sheep sold last
springtime (August) at close on 50s. for-
crossbred wethers. Now, owing to dry
weather, hundreds of thousands of sheep are
crowded into the markets, with a resultant
decline of nearly 20s. a head since August.
The sacrificing of stock, pushed on the
market by drought and grass-fires, has meant
that the prices of fat lambs and killing-sheep
have slumped also. Yet butchers’ prices fox-
mutton have dropped only per lb. If this
isn t profiteering,” what is it, and why?
“Broker”: The determination of Canada
and U.S.A. to plunge into Prohibition has
caused the dumping into Australia of
thousands of barrels of rye whisky, which
were bought to supply the local shortage of
Scotch.’ Manv a liquor trader has since
cursed the deal, for the failure of “rye” to
catch on is absolute. As a result, bonds are
full of the dope bought at a price which has
steadily dropped since it landed ; and it
threatens to break its neck on bedrock now
an announcement has been made that
the trade in U.S.A. is to send it here in
shiploads. Meanwhile “Scotch” gets rarer,
and our own excellent product comes slowlv
into its own.
There may be points about bringing in
toieign capital to develop the great natural
resources of the country, but there are also
drawbacks. If there was one thing Maori-
and was nroud of, apart from its mountains
and glaciers and avalanches and cataracts
md hot lakes and cold lakes and red, blue
and green lakes and geysers and its intellect
and the supreme beauty of its girls, that was
its Union Steamship Co., the biggest concern

Several of the senior Vic. State officers

Not every man who comes before a jury
has the luck of Gregory Cronin, of Mel-
bourne. The trouble began on the evening
of January 4, when Mrs. Cronin presented
her lord with a new baby. This very usual
occurrence so upset his balance that he
immediately left home, burst into a motor-
garage, commandeered a car and drove
off on a joy-ride to parts unknown. He
turned up next morning at Camberwell, bor-
rowed a fiver from a friend, and continued
his gay career out beyond Heidelberg, where
the Law caught up with him. His excus
was “no felonious intent,” and a friendly
dozen accepted it. But Gregory Cronin
ought to be careful. Next time his lady
may surprise him with twins, and then he’l 1
probably break into the Treasury and stea
the deficit, and no jury will overlook that.
“Marqui”: The anti-Prohibitionists sa.
the going dry of America will stop th
supply of Italian immigrants. This mu;
not seem such a calamity, yet it is, for tin
“wops” do the dirty and dangerous work
for the Yanks. The true Yank doesn’t'
work if he can help it. He talks work but
slides into a soft billet and gives orders to
the Dago. Once the Irish immigrant did
the hard toil ; but he didn't stick it. He
also took to directing things, to becoming a
political boss and getting rich quick. Just
now he and the suave Jew are having a race
to the top of the tree. Meanwhile poor
Tony does the donkey work and consoles
himself with wine. But no wine, no
Italian. Maybe the native-born Yanks will
have to rediscover what grubby manual
labor is like.
“William Wardroom” tells of the North
American-West Indies se4 patrol:—
The Sydney spent 1915 and most of 1916 patrol-
ling the American coast from Monte Video to Halifax,
nosing about the ports and seeing that there was no
sign of the Hun merchantmen clearing out. These
Huns were a curse and a worry. A favorite trick
was to start their fires going and make a big smoke,
whereupon our agent ashore would signal frantically,
and we would rush 200 miles to find the Hun at
peace again. Sometimes a ship would actually put
to sea and creep along the coast within the three-
mile limit to the next port. We would follow with
the range-finder on, waiting for her to budge out-
side territorial waters ; but we never had the luck to
swell the prize-money.
There was one interesting job which involved a
knotty legal point. A certain ship of Hun descent
was interned in an American port, and was sold to
the Yanks. There were many of these “sales,” and
as Yankeeland is a country of mixed nationalities it
might well happen that the new owners were the
uncles of the old. So the British Government was
forced to place the onus of proof of a bc\:,a fide
sale upon those who professed to be the purchasers.
The ship sailed from New York for Progreso, Yuca-
tan, with a contraband cargo and manned by Huns.
As the deal smelt a bit in the official nostril we
were sent to Progreso to watch. We arrived there
and found the fox with the mudhook down. Close
by was the U.S. battleship Kentucky. A great
argument arose as to whether or not the ship was
within territorial waters. It tickled the fancies of
the legal-minded members in the mess because our
range-finders made her outside the limit; yet if the
Ilun went closer in she would have run ashore. The
Yanks, however, said their range-finders made the
ship inside Mexican water. So we were forced to
sit down in the open roadstead and wait. Hf was
a tiresome game, and the Americans repeatedly
asked us what we were going to do about it. They
received us with every courtesy, manning ship when
their band played either “Sweet Land of Liberty” or
“God Save.” Aftera few days the watched ship got tired,
too. They had no food or water and no money, and
made querulous signals for sustenance. But there
was nothing doing. Soon after, she began to land
her contraband cargo and store it under the super-
vision of our Consul. We sent a party ashore to see
that citizen, and found the town en fete in honor of
the murder of the last President.
“Settled”: The conscientious Australian
father sweats and plans to give his boy an
education that may fit him for some poorly-
paid scientific or professional post. Mean-
while Bill Sling, the city lumper, or Joe
Haystack, the country laborer, lets the kid
take his chance. It works out this way
here. Going through my wages sheet the
other day for income-tax, I found that
one gang of cane-cutters drew £2 4s. 9d. a
man per day of eight hours, and that
another gang pulled out £2 13s. Gd. per man,
1 found that several of these men could
not sign their names. I know of other men,
equally unlettered, who have' been getting
over £3 a day cane-cutting, and not bursting
themselves at that. Why educate sons?
“Chev”: The little squabbles between
representatives of the Allies at the Peace
Conference regarding rights and privileges
recall the anxious days of 1917, when France
and Italy clamored on. England’s doorstep
for coal. Strikes and rumors of strikes in
colliery districts added to the worries of
Lloyd George, who was doing his best to
supply both France and Italy with fuel and
comfort the two special coal envoys who had
been sent to haunt him. Albert Thomas
represented France, while an Italian of great
tonnage pleaded from Rome. Lloyd George
made an appointment for both to meet him
and discuss the matter at breakfast. (Many
very important things were decided at these
bieakfasts at 10 Downing-street, the little
house opposite the gates of the Foreign
Office.) An editor-friend was one of the
party and enjoyed the fierce argument that
began when the rival coal-getters sat down.
At last Thomas, stung by a quiet innuendo
from the Italian Minister as to the actual
need of France for coal, retorted, “Yes.
Fi ance wants coal —what for, you ask ! I
tell you then! France requires coal for muni
tions to fight the enemy with! Italy wants
coal! What for? Ah ! I tell you! To make
macaroni! Pah !” And then the diplomacy
and tact of Lloyd George came to the rescue.
“Coot”: “Soller” (B. 9/1/Y9) complains
of a charge of 3s. 6d. for a certificate of
death in the Ma State. As “Soe” (B.
23/1/Y9) points out, the charge is 2s. onlv.
But even if it were 3s. Gd. “Soller” wouid
have nothing to growl about. In Victoria
you have to part up 7s. Gd., even where the
exact date is supplied. Certainly for 2s. Gd.
extract of entry” will be forthcoming;
but this gives such meagre particulars that
in many cases it is not accepted as proof.

BEFORE THE MIRROR
By “JEANNETTE.”
These are, undoubtedly, days of exceptional nervous strain for one and
all of us. Anxiety, with its beauty-destroying influence, is casting its shadow
over the lives of many of us women, and w'hile perhaps a few —the more
stoical among us—can avoid worrying over past or prospective events, we
may all, with a little care and forethought, succeed in preventing the result
of worry from being noticeable in our appearance. To these fortunate
few this little chat will, however, be as interesting and instructive as to
those who stand in real need of help in toilet matters, and may be the
means of bringing to their notice some hitherto unknown method of retain-
ing or regaining that beauty of face and figure which is the birthright of
every woman. Some of the ingredients mentioned below are, at present, not
generally known to the public, but any good chemist will usually be found to
have a small quantity in stock.
Freckles and How to Cure Them.—lt is always
those with the finest and fairiest skins who
freckle most easily, but this knowledge is poor
comfort when the face is disfigured with these
ugly little blemishes. To prevent the forma-
tion of freckles a wash should be applied to
the face which will form a shield from the
rays of the sun. A simple and inexpensive one
can be made up at home by dissolving an
ounce of cleminite in four tablespoonfuls of
hot water. Shake the bottle, and when cold
apply to the face and allow lo dry on the
skin. If this is done every day. renewing the
application whenever the face is washed, and
a little mercolised wax rubbed into the skin
every night, freckles will not make their
appearance, no matter how hot the sun. To
remove freckles which have already formed,
apply the wax every night., rub it well into
the skin of the face and neck and leave it on
till the morning. Then wash off, using Pilenta
soap and warm water.
To Reduce a Double Chin.—To reduce a double
chin, give hard, firm massage every night with
mercolised wax, stroking the flesh firmly back-
wards from the chin towards the lower por-
tion of. the neck. Do this every night, and in
the morning bathe with cold water and rub
into the skin a little parsidium jelly. This
treatment will strengthen the flabby tissues
and restore the contour of the face. Occasion-
ally a double chin is due to stooping over
books or work, but, generally it is the result
of putting on weight. When the latter is the
case a few clynol berries, eaten regularly every
day, will greatly assist in reducing the super-
fluous flesh A glass of hot water should be
sipped after each mea’-
Tlie Hair —To Increase the Growth. —To arrest
an undue falling of the hair and increase the
growth, scalp-inassage and the application of
a good tonic is absolutely necessary. Part the
hair in the centre, and, starting at the fore-
head, massage for at least ten minutes. Then
apply a tonic. A simple and inexpensive one
can be made up at home by mixing one ounce
of boranium (which can be bought at the
chemist’s) u'itli a quarter of a pint of bay
rum. Add the boranium to the bay rum, allow
to stand for half an hour, then strain and add
sufficient water to make half a pint. Dab
amongst the roots of the hair with a soft
sponge.
Superfluous Ilair. —Dark-complexioned women
are far more frequently troubled with a
growth of superfluous hair than those with
fair skins, and at the first sign of these objec-
tionable hairs steps should be taken to remove
them, or they will develop into a strong grow.th
which will take a very long time to destroy.
A little powdered plieminol applied to this
growth will remove the unsightly blemish,
destroying it permanently if the hairs be but
few. Two or more applications may be neces-
sary, if the growth be unusually strong, but
about one ounce of plieminol should be suffici-
ent for the most stubborn case. Plieminol can
be obtained at the chemist’s, and a little
powdered alum should be obtained at the
same time for dusting the skin before applying
the plieminol.
ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS.
TO DARKEN THE EYEBROWS (L.M.). —
There is no dye which I could recommend as
“safe,” hut if you rub a little mennaline into
the eyebrows and at the roots of the eyelashes
regularly every night it will darken them
naturally, and will also increase the growth
of the eyelashes.
TO REDUCE WEIGHT (SADIE).—Yes, your
weight and measurements are certainly more
than they should be for your height, and I
quite agree that being so stout makes you look
old. I am pleased to be able to tell you of a
quick, easy and pleasant way to reduce both.
Get a small quantity of clynol berries from
the chemist's and take one after each meal,
three times a day. Weigh yourself after one
month’s treatment, and you will be delighted
with the result.
TO KEEP THE HAIR FAIR (DORIS).—If
you shampoo your hair regularly with stallax
granules it will prevent it from turning dark.
One teaspoon of stallax is sufficient for a
shampoo, and an original packet will make
from 25 to 30 shampoos. Stallax keeps
indefinitely. [4
TO IMPROVE A DULL, MUDDY COM-
PLEXION (D.B ).—Your complexion is dull
and muddy-looking because it needs thorough
cleansing and renewing of the outer cuticle.
To do this get a tin of mercolised wax, and
with the tips of the fingers rub a little gently
into the skin, going over the entire face and
neck. Leave the wax on all night and in the
morning wash it off with a good soap (you
will find Pilenta excellent). In a month’s time
you will notice a most surprising improve-
ment. (2) Liquid pergoi will prevent the
excessive perspiration of wli'cli you complain.
(3) Nothing can be done.
TO ARREST GREYNESS (FLO).—You are
indeed far too young to go grey yet. Get
about two ounces of concentrate of tamma-
lite and mix it with three ounces of bay rum.
Dab this on the hair and amongst the roots.
It will soon make matters all right.
TO WHITEN A BROWN NECK (W.K.).—To
whiten your neck use jettaline. Get a tube of
this from the chemist's and rub a little well
into the skin of the neck; leave it on till next
morning. Do this regularly every night for
three or four weeks and you will find that the
skin will become beautifully clear and white.

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
Still the relief work continues, and 750
of the thousand volunteers are filling in
orders on the grocer and the butcher and
the baker. At the Girls’ High School dur-
ing the week rows and rows of energetic
young men and women were doing long tots
that would make an adding-machine dizzy.
At the Trades Ilall more young men, school-
teachers mostly, attend to the applicants
with an ever-deepening sympathy. Hitherto
lots of them have only seen little Florrie and
•Tommy as clean as mother could make
them; now they realise something of the
effort made by mother to produce the shining
morning face that greets teacher. They
understand that exercise-books can’t always
be spotless when table-space is limited, and
that the penny-in-the-slot gas has an exas-
perating habit of going out before the last
lines of the essay on “Luxury” have been
Avritten.
The inquiry workers have reported only
one ease of glaring imposition. The appli-
cant was plausible, and the very human
assistants did everything in their power to
aid. In due course the investigator Avorked
round to the given address. Small bQy
opened the door a few inches. “Can I see
your father?” “Father’s at work.” “Well,
I’d like to see your mother.” “Mother’s at
work, too!”
Lord Ednam, the Dudley heir, has never
been in Australia, as alleged by several
papers apropos his engagement to Lady!
Rosemary. Colombo was the nearest he
ever got to it. The Dudleys met him there.
That is to say his Excellency and the Dow-
ager. The allegedly-injured wife had fled
back some time previously. A traveller
describes him as a remarkably good-looking
youth and easily the most popular figure oil
the ship. He is very tall and slim and has
the faultless complexion and odd high cheek-
bones and tilted eyes of his mother.
There will be some sad female hearts in
Sydney at the news that Captain Claude
Cumber-loge is coming hack no more. He
first burst on the community at a fancy-
dress ball given by one of the Iveigwin boys.
He wore a, velvet coat and a vast Byronic
collar, and one way and another iooked
almost too poetical and picturesque to live.
He had just that sort of dark, romantic
good-looks. Yet he was weirdly devoid of
vanity. Something disastrous had happened
to his teeth, and he only possessed a few in
front and of inferior quality withal. He
firmly refused for a long time to get false
ones. When, at last, he did, he treated
them neither as tragedy nor as a thing to
be left unmentioned, but as a joke. In addi-
tion, he usually left them at home. A girl
fiiend lent him a I’om., to which he became
much attached. Deciding that the Pom.’s
coat was too heavy to be comfortable in the
tropics, he had it shaved. An unclothed
I om. is a strange sight, and the two aroused
keen interest wherever they went; but the
gallant tar paid no attention to that. He
was quite the most blandly unconventional
naval man that this country has known.
On a recent evening, at St. John’s, Ash-
hold all m -white tulle and silver, Stella
Dreytord, youngest chick of Mr. and Mrs
J. T. Evans, of the local Bank of N. S.
Wales, said she would when a leading ques-
tion was put to her in reference to Herbert
Sydney Henley, sou of Thomas, M.L A the
hard-battling War Chest Commissioner in
England, The bridesmaids, Lottie Evans
sister to the star performer, and Marjorie
Russell floated in clouds of pink tulle, and
the tram-bearer, Miss Minchin, in the same
shade with an overdress of lace and net.
The biide set forth on her travels in cream
tailorings.
Papa Henley was a furiously active State
politician before the war. He flung the
whole of his gifts as an Empire orator into
the row over the “theft of Government
House from the King,” as it was called at
the time. An excitable little man in an
immense and very dusty howler hat vocifer-
t 0 ;' n apathetic Saturday afternoon
~iowd in the giounds of Government ’Ouse
P er “« te <? in callin ? it—that is a memory
which still lingers with manv. lie found
!us true metier in Red Crossing. There never
was a harder worker at the business. In
the invalided Aussies were the envy
of every British and Indian hospital patient
in the place; and Major Henley, as lie then
was, had a great deal to do with it. Pride
in his soldier-son spurred him on, and then
came the news of the brave youngster’s
death in action. It broke the old man up
for a while ; but he is game or nothing, and
he pulled himself together and tore into his
job afresh. Not many earned a decoration
better than he did.
Last week a writer in S. M. Herald had
her granny interviewed in a pleasant sketch
entitled “In Grandma’s Day.” The middle-
aged lady (she can hardly be called old if
she 'was a debutante of only 30 years ago)
gossips about the visit of the two Royal
middies who were in Sydney that number of
years back. “No, I did not dance with Prince
George,” says the lady; “but I remember his
dancing with a pretty little girl, Mary
Stephen.” Well, this writer’s granny, on
being questioned, says she also was at that
ball, and she recalls how the Princes’ tutor,
probably acting under Government House
advice, selected the middies’ dancing part-
ners. The “little girl, Mary Stephen,” noiv
Mrs. Monty Severn, was toted along by
tutor four times to each prince in one even-
ing. And then toted back to her seat again.
This is a photo-
graph of H. M.
Some r, executive
officer for 13 years
of the Sydney Agri-
cultural Society. Un-
lucky number again;
for just as “Monty”
got to work ou the
Society’s Jubilee
Show, which was
going to outdo all
previous records in
spite of the drought,
the plague came
along to make all
things uncertain.
Still, lie isn’t down-
hearted. “It’ll be all
over by Easter, and
then they’ll all come
down together,” says the optimist. A good,
big-hearted Australian, with an Irish streak,
Mr. Somer was brought up in the bush on
stations and farms. In the long ago he
drifted into journalism, and was the pump-
kin editor on the Sydney Mail for some
time. It was to his suggestion that Gran’ma
Herald owes her “On the Land” department,
which Mr. Somer conducted for, three years
prior to becoming secretary of the R.A.S.
Mrs. R. E. O'Connor, widow of the late
High Court Judge, with her daughters
Kathleen and Winifred, is staying at Bunda-
noon. Winifred is Mrs. Macleay. Kath-
leen is the girl with the Voice, and
she sings her own compositions so sky-
larkily that Bundanoon, which was already
a bird-haunted place, would seem to be get-
ting an excessive share of melody.
The pretty Miss Asquith, whom 'the
papers mention as having got engaged to a
prince with a wildly-foreign name, belongs
to a set in London that contains many Aus-
tralians. One of her friends is Marie Beer-
bolnn. She married Ernest Watt, of Syd-
ney, but they failed to click, as the saying
goes, and after a year or so cut the painter
by the convenient agency of a nullity suit,
all parties being quite amicable over the
transaction. Another Asquith intimate is
the. beautiful young woman who used to be
Elsie Anderson, of this city, and whose
soldier-husband Avas killed at Ypres.
Homeward bound, Lieut.-Col, Blacklow,
D. 5.0., and champion rifleshot, who repre-
sented this part of the world at Bisley
before la guerre. Mrs. Blacklow is well
known as singer Geraldine Rivers. She had
three lads in khaki, but one, the eldest, a
major at 28, went west about a year ago.
The other two left with the artillery, and
are still on the well list.
Homeward bound on the Orsova, Major
Cuthbert Fetherstonhaugh, D. 5.0., and his
wife, who was Vic Lyne, daughter of Oom
Bill. The Major owns some sheep territory
out Coon amble way, from which he has been
absent for the greater part of four years.
His wife’s li.q. were in Cairo, where she
gave a hand to the Red Cross.
William Tilley, managing director of the
Australia, is on the passenger-list of the
Niagara, which ought to be leaving Van-
couver at about this moment. He has been
looking over the hotels of U.S.A. and Canada
for hints to benefit the big caravanserai in
Gastlereagh-strcet. But it will be “Help!”
if he brings back a pattern of their bills.
Fairy godmother Eadith Walker has once
more been busy with her pen and cheque-
book. This time it is the Police and Fire-

Here’s a dentist’s trick that may save you
from being run over by a hearse. If you
wear specs as well as a Fitzgerald mask,
you have found the glasses clouded if the
upper part of the mask hasn’t been
thoroughly-well moulded to the face. Before
the toothsmith pushes his small mirror into
your mouth he smears it liberally with soap
and then wipes it. Try the same plan with
your pince-nez.
The second Macfarlane sister leaves Aus-
tralia next month for the Cold Country. She
was one of the two who made the Macfarlane
portraits so popular.
There is to be a real Australian wedding
at Elderslie (Q.) on March 2(1. The ’groom
will be W. 11. Rudd, jun. (usually called
“Bill”) ; the bride Ruby Brabazon. After-
Avards the pair will settle down in the North-
ern Territory at Austral Downs. The
Austral Downs house has water laid on
from a lake, and a garden with all
kinds of fruit trees, roses and vegetables.
Bridegroom Bill just loves to hear flabby
theorists say the Territory is only fit for the
colored races.
Now that the Armistice has been signed
and Roberts’s Hotel burned to the ground,
Farmers’ feel justified in laying the founda-
tion-etone for the extension that is to complete
and crown their block. Market-street, from
Pitt to George streets, in another two years
will be a-shimmer with plate-glass, and the
spoils from the east and the west, of the earth
and the Poles thereof will stretch enticing-
hands. Of course, there always is a fly in
the ointment —separation allowances will no
longer buy chiffons.
Bessie Reeve, daughter of the one and
only Ada, is driving a taxi. A week or two
ago she drew her certificate from the bottom
of her suit-case and hired herself to the
nearest garage, which is run by a returned
Anzac. Tel.— No. Many taxi-drivers are
married men with families.
Reported that Beatrice' Yaldwin, Cousin
Ethel of the alabaster shoulders who gave
the glassy stare to poor Peg o’ My Heart,
has promised herself for keeps to a young
man who shears rubber in the Federated
Malay States.
T May Gibbs is singing lullabies to her Gum
Nut babies in Perth, where the ’flumonic
regulations have anchored her.
Still another Royal Red Cross coming to
Australia. This one is tucked away among
the belongings of Sister N. Morrice. She
used to be sub-matron of the 25th British
General Hospital in France.
Tea and dinner dances at the Wentworth
promise to be a feature of the winter. The
annexe that leads on to the garden is to be
the scene of the fox trot, the one-step and
the new waltz, which is more like a rhythmic
walk-about than anything else.
The winter hats are to be small, soft and
fitting to the head. Crowns and brims are
reduced to the smallest fraction. The camel-
hair hat is the very latest cry, and you can
have overcoat and scarf of the same delec-
table material. The Camel Corps bov can
get some of his own back by wrapping his
sister and his cousin and his aunt in the
crop of the jibbing beast.
This is a copy of
the passport photo of
the most cussed and
discussed man i n
Australia now that
the Emperor Wil-
liam isn’t here—Pre-
mier T. J. Ryan oi
Queensland. And
he isn’t here either
for that matter: the
last we heard of him
Avas from England,
where he was going
to ask the Privy
Council to make the
Queensland Judges
call his friend
McCawley their
learned brother.
Whether people hate
Ryan or not they nearly a-11 admit his clever-
ness. And his industry. Last general election
he addressed 120 meetings in six weeks: his
record for a day was nine meetings. It
wasn’t like his first campaign in the Bare no:
he didn’t have Government motor-cars to
help him then. Arriving in Tarnbo, he was
met by an old grey mare, on which was
painted the legend—“ Vote for Ryan and
Justice.” Behind her trotted a long-
legged foal, labelled “Me Ryan too !” His
handsome and capable wife is his inseparable
companion and valued adviser.
Amid ail her stress and mourning, France
has still had time to show her appreciation
of the services rendered in French interests
in the far-off country where Billjim grows;
so it follows that Mrs. M. Garvin, the retir-
ing principal of the Girls’ High School,
wears the decoraton of the Palmes Academ-
iques. Officially Mrs. Garvin continues in
the service of the Department till October
next.
Dr. Scot Skirving is homing by the
Osterley, with his lieutenant-son, Robert,
and son Robert’s -wife, who was Stephanie
Barton. Dr. Scot Skirving has been work-
ing in military hospitals since the beginning
'or the war.
Captain Beaufort Burdekin is going back
to his English wife next week. He is the
youngest of the family, and was at Oxford
when the war began. He joined the R.F.A.
and was wounded. Leaving hospital he got
married and returned to the firing-line.
Latterly his battery was in front of Ypres
within a few yards of the dugout in which
poor young Adrian Stephen met his end.
The Sep Levys are due in Sydney in about
a week. For the last three years they have
been living between the Carlton (London)
and the Metropole (Brighton), with occa-
sional stays at Maidenhead. Maitland, the
eldest boy and the pride of the family, was
a captain in the Irish Guards, and he won
the Military Cross at Passchendaele a year
ago. And then he was shot dead. He was
another exemplar of the fact that Jews are
the bravest and best of soldiers when they
put their mind to it. The tragedy in his
case was that he never need have joined up
in the first instance —he was constitutionally
delicate and was turned down' by a dozen
doctors before he found one sufficiently com-
plaisant to pass him. And, again, he need
not have returned to the line after his first
spell of fighting, which ended in a dose of
trench fever. Douglas, the second boy, en-
listed in the A.I.F. and had risen to cor-
poral’s rank when his brother died. The
C.O. of the regiment then asked the A.I.F.
authorities for him to fill Maitland’s place.
It was a unique tribute to the dead young-
ster.
Dorothy Gard’ner, the dainty soubrette of
Branscombe’s Violet Dandies, drops a cheer-o
from her cousin's farm in the Great Karoo.
South Africa is still the Land of Wonder to
her. She is under the Steel-Payne manage-
ment, and their last tour embraced 85 towns.
Next tour takes in Rhodesia, and Dorothy
promises to ink her sensations on viewing
the Victoria Falls.
The typewriter is an intelligent little ani-
mal at times, especially when the person
who works it is inexperienced and lets it go
its own way. A southern seaside hotelkeeper
tells how amateur typing quite unintention-
ally produced this heading to an account,
meant to be rendered to "a dubious-looking
week-end pair who had put on any amount
of side:—
JOHN JONES. ESQ! AND MRS. ? JONES.-
By Brisbane heliograph :
The climate was doubtless responsible for the death
of Mrs. Rebecca Balser, aged 85, at Teneriffe last
week. She arrived in Sydney in 185 G, and soon
moved up to Jlananaland. She was the fifth white
woman to arrive in what is now Rockhampton, and
a few years later went further north to Towns-
ville and Oooktown. For the last 11 years she had
lived in Brisbane. A busy knitting patriot to the
en.‘.
Members of the Red Cross Society, Soldiers’ Com-
forts Fund and Wool Spinning Guild are all busy
making masks so that a good supply shall be on
hand i! required.
Brisbane Daily' Mail Yvas cruel to the Health
authorities the other day. There was a scare after
the Nestor men landed, and a case suspiciously like
’flu was reported. The Mail urged all Nestor men
to report immediately if they felt any unpleasant
symptoms, “so that the Health authorities may
-catch the disease immediately.”
Hear'y rain spoilt the second day of the patriotic
cricket match at the Exhibition Ground. Last
Wednesday a large crowd arrived perspiringly and
ipaid good money at the gate for the AVar Nurses’
bund. Ihe Military Band blew and the serenaders
arrived and gave an impromptu concert. Tea-toilers
worked under the eye of Mrs. A. B. Carvosso in the
room below the grandstand.
the City Council thundered the other night over
the old question of mixed bathing. Aid. McMaster
still persists that it is all right on a beach, but
quite wrong in a properly-supervised municipal
hath. The majority of the aldermen want the new
baths at New Farm to be built specially for mixed
swimming, and they seem likely to win.
Capt. Arthur Benjamin and his mother are leaving
London on March 28 for Australia. Arthur was
stm.ying music in London when war broke out. and
he joined up, went to France and gained captain’s
rank. Then he qualified for a commission in the
R.l'.C., and returned to Normandy. Later on his
machine played up, and he fell into the German
lines and was taken prisoner. He was returned to
England recently, and is now coming home to see
father before he turns musician again.
Arnold AVeinholt’s bride-to-be, Enid Sydnev
Jones, is a stepdaughter of the late Speaker of the
Queensland Parliament. The lady, who, by the
way, has a gift for writing, has a sister who
married the only son of pearl-man Clarke, and found
herself a widow very soon afterwards. Her soldier
fell in Palestine.
Because, of the door being barred to visi-
tors, hospital wards are almost barren of
blooms: so any fine morning when your
asters and cactus-dahlias are looking parti-
cularly healthy, a basketful picked for the
nearest house of healing will bring refresh-
ment to many tired and fevered eyes.

Goodyearite cannot burn, blow
or squeeze. It stands first in
all competitive tests including
the resistance of heat up to
750° Fahrenheit, and steam
pressure of over 4001bs to the
square inch.
A sheet of Goodyearite tV inch thick
measuring 36 inch x 36 inch weighs
approximately 6 lbs and sells at
4/6 per pound.
For your protection it is stamped
Goodyear Goodyearite on every two
inches of packing.
Send to one of our branches for a
sheet and we will explain the
method of application proved most
satisfactory by experience.
Here is an opportunity to prove our
claim that Goodyearite is the best
High-pressure Asbestos Steam
Packing on this market.
Modern methods of manufacture demand
higher and still higher pressures of steam
to drive the specialised machinery which
makes for increased output.
This need-renders necessary the provision of a high
grade Asbestos steam packing, that will withstand
enormous pressures and high temperatures without
losing its efficiency.
Those engineers who take every possible precaution,
not only for the sake of efficiency and elimination of
shut downs caused by faulty joints, but also as a safe
guard against injury to machinery and mechanics,
are using Goodyearite, .the long fibre Asbestos
Sheet Packing.
Goodyearite, both white and graphited, is made from the longest
fibred rock Asbestos obtainable, compressed into sheets, and
contains only a minimum of binding. Manufactured by a special
Goodyear process, gaskets made from it resist amazing pressures
and heat. It eliminates the danger and annoyance of leaky joints
and the necessity of frequent renewal.
Goodyearite is unquestionably the most economical packing that you can
put into any steam joint except those carrying very low pressures. We ask
you to make comparative tests with Goodyearite, the results of which will
fully prove the claims we make.

Sister McKinnell. the matron, who
declined to hand over charge of the influ-
monia hospital at the Exhibition to the
nuns when Bowser issued the order through
Dr. Robertson, is a stiff-necked person.
When she took charge she had. beds placed
for nurses on the verandah at the hack of
State Parliament House, which is a wing of
the Exhibition. It is said that a nurse yr
two went into Parliament House by mis-
take ; anyway, the officials were perturbed,
and Bowser was moved by high officials to
have the beds shifted. But Sister McKinnell
demurred. She wouldn’t have her nurses
inconvenienced, she said. Let them send
the Premier, or Governor-General, or any-
body else who objected, and she would talk
to him. Finally a modification of arrange-
ments was made, hut it was to the liking of
the forceful Sister McKinnell.
Lieut.-Col. W. .T. S. Davidson, of Warr-
nambool these many years, is hack again at
the old stand. Leaving with the field-guns
in 1915 he commanded an ammunition
column early in 1916,' and afterwards went
with Light Horse to France. There lie com-
manded in succession a howi t brigade, a
battery of field-guns, and again an ammuni-
tion column. Discharged in 1918, with the
D. 5.0., he joined up once more during the
same year and had got as far as Egypt
when the Hun decided to kamerad.
Still more Riverina money is going'into
the Western District, Brung Brungle, on
the Wannon, having been bought by Ralph
Falkiner. The ancient squattage had been
worked for nearly half a century by the
Richard Ramsden family.
Captain Ronald Cumming, of Mt. Fyans
squattage and the Caramut Polo Club, is
hack in Australia with a distinguished scar
and the Croix de Guerre. He left for France
as Brig.-General McNicoll’s orderly on that
warrior’s second trip from Australia, and
received a terrible wound at Fasschendaele.
Afterwards he got back to France with the
lI,Q. staff of the 10tli Infantry, though he
could have made Australia instead if he
hadn’t preferred to hang on.
Last week this page connected Dr. Lee
Atkinson with the Bendigo Atkinsons. The
medico is a Melbourne man who has only
had the worry of flumonia. The Bendigo
Leigh Atkinsons specialise in will worries.
Ever since Christmas the Dandenong
Ranges, beloved of week-enders, had not
been free from tire till last week—not grass
fires, hut huge trees smouldering 50ft. from
the ground, blazing up with every hot wind,
then dying down again. Some little places
had vanished when their owners came up;
nothing was left hut bits of twisted iron bed-
steads. In places trees were blazing high
over the heads of coach passengers as they
drove along the rough roads. Above Mon-
bulk one giant that had been burning for
days toppled over and rolled down the moun-
tain-side. A cheerful party, supping in
their two-roomed humpy below, heard the
crash and skipped outside —just in time, for
the monster swept away the living-room.
Melbourne streets will miss sprightly Boh
Whiting for a little while; he lias a rendez-
vous with the surgeon.
Ex-aviator Foster Rutledge is impatient
about the quarantine restrictions that are
keeping his wife and brand-new baby at
Portsea. Mrs. Foster was Mildred Mani-
fold, daughter of the Willie Manifolds of
Purrumbete, who are marked 33 pence a
pound amongst the pure merino families.
All the friends of Mrs. Hunter Landale
have rallied round her with their sympathy.
Her husband died a few weeks ago; now
the news of the death of her young son
Donald in England is announced. This
courageous stripling of IS went to the war
with some fellow schoolboys only a few
months ago.
_ News comes from Paris of the death of
Yvonne Wilson Bucbard, daughter of Mrs.
Hector Wilson, late of Vectis station. Mrs.
Bucbard was the wife of Admiral Buoltard,
who was for some time commandant at Mada-
gascar. Her mother, Mrs. Hector Wilson,
was the French actress Eugenie le Grand,
who in the early days played the beautiful
adventuress in such melodramas as “Youth”
with William Rignold. Eugenie’s first hus-
band was Kyrle Bellew, but the union didn’t
last long and she afterwards married Hec-
tor Wilson, brother of Charles, Norman and
Artliur Wilson, nephews of knight Samuel.
Mrs. Hector is a time-defying Frenchwoman
and a crony of Sarah Bernhardt.
The Norton Grimwades are preparing a
joyous welcome home for their naval-
iieutenant son Lionel, who has sent
word that he has been appointed to
the Jervis Bay College. Young Lionel,
who commenced his war service as a
midshipman, helped in the Evacuation; later
he was on the destroyer Ullswater, which got
badly knocked about in a collision just before
the armistice. His flying brother, Lieut.
Fred, who spent some months in a German
prison camp and is booked to marry Jo Askin
Foster, is now out of khaki and back in the
old Felton-Grimwade business.
Toorak was saddened by the news that
Vera, second daughter of Mrs. Andrew
Loughnan, was dead. The poor girl put up
a great fight for life against a pneumonic
attack supervening on inoculation. Vera
had inherited the brunette beauty of her
mother (a Sydney McLean) and was a most
popular girl.
When Anzac Lieut. Phil Hudson hopped
ashore he had to rub his eyes hard to dis-
cover the babes lie left behind him in the
small hoy and girl who leaped at him when
mother signalled which was dad. Lieut.
Phil laid down a profitable architect’s pen to
help knock out Fritz.
Australian Mildred Gillespie, W.R.N.S.
(which means Women’s Royal Naval Ser-
vice, or something like that), fancies she
looks rather Beatty-ish in her latest uniform.
She has been war-
working since the
beginning of Arma-
geddon, and is en-
gaged for her pre-
sent job for from
six to 12 months
after the dove comes
home to roost. The
job is in the Port
Mine s Sweeping
Office (you somehow
expect a woman to
he in on a sweeping
job), and she votes
it the most solid
and interesting work
in her varied war-
career, which in-
cludes service under
five different Gov-
ernments —English, Australian, French, Bel-
gian and Italian. She was with the splen-
did nurses who looked after the wounded in
the first chaotic stages of the war, sleeping
when they could and where they could —they
occasionally even had the luxury of a bunch
of straw. At one time she was in the Hos-
pital Anglais du Casino. Fhcamp, doing
massage work. After being a hospital
patient herself for a while she was sent
to work at Eton Hall, the Duke of West-
minster’s place by the sands of Dee, which
had been turned into a hospital. After
that to a confidential post at Grimsby, near
her old Australian pal, the Doughty lady,
and then to this W.R.N.S. job, where she is
at work now.
The Charles Brown couple (he is head of
the Melbourne Grammar Middle School) are
in mourning for Hamilton, their second child,
a particularly clever and attractive little
chap who had been looking forward to his
seventh birthday. The family had just
returned to town after spending the vacation
at Portsea, when young Hamilton, with his
brother and only sister, went down with
influenza.
Adelaide gets in early :
Glenelg’s Repatriation carnival, planned to run
for a week, opened on Saturday in steamy weather
that gave way to torrents of rain and washed the
enthusiasm out of the proceedings. On the same
day Woodville supporters of the District Trained
Nurses’ Society had a fete in Dr. Bollen’s grounds.
The evening part of the show had to be abandoned.
Records show that to the end of June last year this
State had raised £1,194,320 for patriotic funds, of
which £347,727 came in the last 12 months.
Surgeon-Capt. Lewis, of Gawler, is on -the road
to recovery after being'seriously ill in France. His
wife is one of the Bonython clan. Another con-
valescent is the E. C. Stirling knight, who was
gravely ill early in the week.
Capt. H. S. Hudd, M.C., is going to put in some
time in England inquiring into town planning and
country public-house trusts before returning to
Australia.
Major C. T. Turner, of the A.A.M.C., is due in
Adelaide in early March. He was on the Adver-
tiser staff in pre-war days, and has annexed a Mili-
tary Cross during his three and a half years’ active
service.
Mrs. Henry Jacob has given the City Council a
sextant which was used by Col. Light in his survey
of Adelaide and was left by him to the late William
Jacob, a member of his staff.
Lieut. Neil Campbell, who was reported missing
during the Hun offensive 10 months ago after being
wounded at Gallipoli and again in France, has been
found. He is a son of the late Dr. Alan Campbell
and was married, shortly before the war, to the
younger daughter of popular Judge Gordon.
Adelaide Uni. Conservatorium has added William
Silver and Harold Wylde to its teaching staff. Both
are South Aus. born, but the one has had, besides
good local training, a course (long ago) in Stutt-
gart, the other in England. Silver specialises in the
piano ; Wylde plays the organ also. Dr. Ennis, till
recently director of the Conservatorium, has im-
proved in health, and is going to take up private
teaching in Adelaide.
Pretty Queenie Brisbane, daughter of the
late Tom, who was clerk of the Executive
Council and a particular pal of the Markiss
of Linlithgow, is prcudly displaying the
usual diamond symbol. The author of the
gift is Lionel Batten, who pursues industrial
news for the Herald. Batten once nursed
political ambitions and nominated for the
Kooyong seat, but gallantly withdrew in
favor of Vida Goldstein.
“Tup” Williams, the popular Associate
of the C.J., has persuaded Ellie O’Loghlen
to say Yes. Ellie is a daughter of the
Bryan O’Loglilen dame, and “Tup’s” hand-
some sister Murid, once Mrs. Toby Watt, is
now Lady Lawford. The O’Loghlen girls
run a hat foundry.
Captain Bruce Pearce, wlio is to be passed
over to the custody of Betty Paterson at no
distant date, lias just been landed in plump
condition by the transport Berrima. Though
lie was laid up by ’flu in London, he man-
aged to recover in time to travel round a
goff course in pursuit of Braid, the English
professional champion. Young Pearce is
not too slow with a goff-stick, but lie admits
1 hat Braid leaves him a dot in the distance.
Widower Angus Young, who carries his
70 years as easily as he shoulders liis “gawf”
clubs, handed out a surprise packet to his
friends the other day in the shape of a
brand-new wife. The bridegroom lias
enough to keep a whole pack of wolves from
his South Yarra doorstep.
Western District wool-grower Wettenhall
and Miss Dennis of Geelong astonished the
Geelongese the other day by suddenly appear-
ing asjrne. They dispensed with the usual
cake and confetti trimmings. The bride-
groom is as hale and hearty as most boys
are at 60. The bride, who belongs to one of
Geelong’s old families, is considerably
younger.
Winifred Austin, the Western District
squatter-politician’s eldest daughter, was
married in Geelong on Tuesday evening last
to _ Gordon Fulton, of Maoriland. Bride
Winifred wore white charmeuse and a
genuine Honiton lace veil icaned by a femi-
nine cousin. The bridesmaid’s sister Vera
and Beatrice Mackintosh had sacrificed
beauty to effect by flying little bows of the
bridegroom’s racing colors (dark red and
yellow) down the backs of their pale yellow
Georgette fixings.
On February 6 the inhabitants of Warr-
nambool who hadn’t work to do went to the
Anglican church to see Archie Macfarlane
help Peggy McCormick get married. It
was the biggest show of the kind seen there
for years.
This frank and youthful countenance be-
longs to Dr. Charles Littlejohn, who recently
returned from the Front with a load of
decorations. The doc-
tor joined the
It.A.M.C. in 1914
and was present at
the Hazebrouck
scrap, when Prince
Max of Hesse was
shot and captured
by the British. The
roya] corpse was
handed over to the
Mayor of Caestre, a
neighboring village,
for decent burial.
Soon the deceased
relatives, including
the Queen of Greece,
endeavored through
neutral channels to
recover the remains.
P e r mission was
readily given by the French Government;
but the Mayor of Caestre was a different
problem. He had hidden the coffin and he
refused to produce it until the Huns had
paid 25,000,000 francs compensation for
wanton damage to his native place. The
House of Hesse considered that Max wasn’t
worth the money, so the young man still
sleeps apart from his fathers. Dr. Little-
john, who tells this yarn, is now engaged in
shooing the tin’ out of the Melbourne Exhi-
bition. He is an F.R.C.S. and married the
daughter of the Lord-Lieutenant of Fife, so
what chance do you think a mere germ has?
The wedding of Shiela Piper, niece of the
Western District John Moffats, and Dr. John
Young, of the Horsham clan, was staged
on the lawn at the back of the Toorak Scotch-
byterian kirk on Wednesday last. A white
canopy and pink carpet runner supplied the
decorative scheme, with the aid of the sur-
rounding flower-beds. The bride draped her
head in a pink veil, had a dash of pink in
her bouquet, and trailed a train lined with
pink. Cousin Mary Moffat bridesmaided
in fawn trappings, dashed with blue topped
by a black hat flying one long feather.
Captain Eric Philip Itussell has brought
back pretty Jess Fairbairn as his missus.
His mother, Mrs. Philip Russell, owing to
an innings in a private hospital is unable
to wave a handkerchief to the happy couple
over the quarantine back fence.
Freda Sternberg, formerly Melba’s secre-
tary, is now fixed in a steady job on Tiie
Province, in Vancouver.
Sydney De Loghe, of “The Straits Impreg-
nable” and “Pelican Pool,” sails for the
land of his birth on the 26th. The promis-
ing young man has been rushed almost to
death saying good-bye to his Australian
friends, who hope that the bush, which he
knows better than many a born Aussie, will
lure him back again.
From over the water: —
One of the unique clubs of the world was formed
in Vancouver (8.C.) at the end of last year. The
qualification is that a man shall have lost a limb
in the great scrap ; and it calls itself the Amputa-
tion. At once it won sympathy and support. A
suite of offices was placed at its service free of
charge; stationers, office furnishers and so on pro-
vided fitments; and writers, artists and ad-men
collaborated on an ambitious book called “The Gold
Stripe.” Proceeds went to the Club. Altogether
the new organisation is away to a good start. Its
basic idea is that by fellowship and mutual assist-
ance the disabilities under which members labor
shall be mitigated as far as possible.
Since the theatres were closed several
open-air concerts have been held by out-of-
work musicians in Alexandra Park, just
over Princes Bridge. Thousands of citi-
zens swarmed to all of them, many bringing
cushions and rugs and having a lazy, happy
time. Edwin sat back-to-back with Ern-
estine in the cool of *tlie evening; and family
parties gathered round with lemonade and
biscuits. There was a collection, of course;
but that didn’t worry most .people. In fact,
it worried the audiences so little that the
musicians presently decided that the M.C.G.
ground would be a better ’ole. There was
a tremendous change in the receipts then.
After the buttons had been discarded from
the boxes at the previous shows, the ghost
had walked to the tun-e of only Is. 3d. per
performer.
Inspired by Health Minister Bowser’s
suggestion that unemployed actors might
earn an honest penny by playing as hospital
wardsmen, Frank Harvey did himself and
his crowd no good by stumbling into print
last week to tell Bowser that he so appreci-
ated the advice that if an ungrateful con-
stituency ever gave the lion, member the
sack, he. (Harvey) would be pleased to
offer him (Bowser) a job as dresser. As a
matter of fact Harvey is otherwise en-
gaged. He is taking the opportunity afforded
him by being out of work to re-grow the
sweet little moustache that was so admired
by flappers in “The Man Who Stayed at
Home.”
A note from Port Phillip Heads: —
The ’flu epidemic has left the Port Phillip resorts
lamenting. Mornington, Sorrento and Queenscliff all
report a shortage of trippers and cling to the few
they have inveigled into their pubs and hash-houses.
One Queenscliff establishment, accustomed to feed
ever a hundred at a time, has a daily roll-up of a
dozen. Only at fashionable Portsea life persists
with its old exuberance, rigidly secluded from the
gaze of the vulgah. The village is a remote and
exclusive spot where a number of Melbourne notables
try to add something to the natural resources of the
scenery. Most of the time they fool at goff or
bridge or annoy restful flathead with unsuitable
bait. But their great function is the daily prom-
enade in bathing garments along the toy jetty.
Callow youths, gay old dogs and embryo duchesses
are all gaily attired for washing, though they are
plainly postponing the horrible performance as long
as possible. Some of the damsels sport kimonos
as a reluctant concession to outraged modesty, and
top off with a Jap umbrella, with a facsimile of a
Jap nightmare on the ceiling thereof. A couple of
mermaidens are striped pea-green, like an Irish
zebra ; they are wearing their one garment so close
to the skin that I wonder if the costume was painted
on. The neighborhood has an idea that it has
been translated into French for the season, though
English is still occasionally spoken by those who
haven’t been to Toorak to learn Parisian.
Next door to Portsea seven or eight hundred are
suffering the softened rigors of quarantine under the
care of a Government that endeavors to make the
pi'oeess a picnic. The prisoners have 3000 acres
of scenery to roam over, with bay and ocean beaches
for bathing, and there is plenty of food and reading
matter for their spiritual recreation. Some of the
numerous Diggers are enjoying the holiday, and
doubtless several will develop high temperatures
when they have to come out. Many spend the day
in the water and occasionally have to be warned
about venturing out too far from the shore. Shark?
are very hungry at this point, and there is also
dangerous ebb running like a race through the Heat
that will finish the strongest swimmer afloat.

Ted Whiting was wasted as a civilian.
He could have covered himself with glory, and would
have apparently been in no danger, had he joined
the A.I.F. and pushed into every possible raid. In
addition, he would have eluded his would-be assassins.
The skulking revolver-wielding type of homicide
rarely risks his skin in battle. Whiting, who was
a middleweight, dates back to the period when the
Gaiety boomed in Sydney, and the rank and fashion
of the N. S. Wales boxing world assembled to watch
fights in the place that is now Fuller’s National.
* * * *
No industry is harder hit by drought and
’flu than racing. The position of the horse-trainers
is bad enough. They get from £2 10s. to £3 per
animal per week, but look to various legitimate
cuts, more especially during the big meetings, to
inflate their incomes. In view of the murky outlook
many owners are beginning to turn their prads out.
The pony-trainers are even more disastrously situ-
ated. They mostly work on an agreement to support
their animals and hand a percentage of the win-
nings to the owners. Now, with feed at almost a
record price, their charges are as unreproductive as
a steam-heating apparatus in Bourke.
The gloomy feature of the ’flu hold-up is
that no one can see an end to it. Many doctors
say that the disease was in N. S. Wales eight, months
ago. In the six weeks that it admittedly has been
in the State it has only killed at the rate of about
6 p.c. of those it has attacked. But ordinary
pneumonia kills on a 10 p.c. basis. If the Govern-
ment is going to wait till the death-rate gets lower
our present-day yearlings will never carry colors;
and the situation is equally hopeless if the idea is to
hang on till the curse disappears altogether, since it
is not only epidemic and pandemic, but also sporadic.
England months ago had as bad a dose as Victoria is
now suffering from; it died down, and now it has
burst forth afresh. Nor is there any evidence that
it won’t do the same thing for years.
* * * *
At the A.J.C. Committee meeting at the
end of last week it was decided to frame a new rule
of racing, making the wearing of skull caps by
jockeys compulsory.
Lord D’Abernon has just been reported as
saying that when he met Australians racing in
England he felt ashamed of the accommodation offered
them. There are more reasons than conservatism to
account for the discomfort of the English courses.
For one thing, their tremendous number. London is
rimmed with them and every,fair-sized town has one
or more; The result is too few dates to make the
game the gold-mine that it is, for instance, to
Randwick. For the same reason the racegoer in Eng-
land who wants to spend the day in anything resem-
bling comfort has to pay through the nose for it.
At Aintree before tlfe war it cost £5 a day to view
the National from the general stand. On a misty
day it was impossible to see more than half the race;
in really bad weather (as in the year when Grudon
won) no one could see more than the start and the
finish from the stands. Compare it with the view to
be got at Caulfield for half a sovereign !
At . courses like Epsom and Newmarket the race-
goer is met at every turn with paddocks, enclosures
and stands, each of which requires the outlay of yet
another guinea, and at Ascot and Goodwood there
are places where the average over-sea visitor couldn’t
penetrate by putting down the cash value of every
racehorse present. Sandown, Gatwick, Hurst Park
and a dozen other courses near London have a mem-
bership system. Under it the habitual racing man
or woman spends annually, in club subscriptions
alone, as much as would keep a couple of middle-
class families in comfort. None of them are within
miles of Randwick regarded as racecourses. But the
same applies to some big local courses. For in-
Flemington. When it rains there the course
becomes a lake. And the stands are mostly old and
out-of-date. An architectural authority and a <■* rc \ic
turfite estimated, recently, that it would tak. Jt
least £lOO,OOO to make Flemington a first-class race-
course.
“75”: There is a Y.R.C. betting rule--a
legacy inherited by that august body from the old
Victorian Club, when it took over the job of settling
disputed wagers—which states: “Money given to
have a bet made shall not be returned though the
race be not run.” The absurd rule has been in
existence for ever 40 years, but, as there has been
no occasion to put it into force, many bookmakers
are not even aware of it. Under it punters who have
made investments on the Newmarket Handicap and
Australian Cup may be in the soup without having
had a run for their money. tit was intended, of
course, as originally framed to cover “optional
wagers”—a variety of gamble familiar in England,
but practically unknown here.]
* * * *
The Thirkall brothers established a fine
record at the recent round of meetings in Tas-
mania. With four horses they won 11 races in 16
starts, and three times ran second. F. Graham, a
Melbourne rider, piloted their winners.

- Gloaming paid another 200 per cent, divvy
on Saturday, collecting the Wanganui (M.L.)
Guineas by two lengths.
“I have just regained my license after
being suspended for two years, and if I am fined I
might lose it again.” said a Sydney jockey, last
week, to a magistrate before whom he appeared on
a “language” charge. A bookie, while emerging
recently from the abode of what the sportsmen of
old Greece used to call a hetaira, was smitten upon
the head by a malefactor who was after his day’s
takings. lie was hauled up before the A.J.C.—for
the “offence” of having a particular lady friend. An
ordinary “drunk” case, without any complications,
w T ouhl land bookie, trainer or jockey in the limbo
of unemployment for an indefinite period. What
arrant humbug it all is ! It is no reflection on the
A.J.C. Committee to mention that most of the mem-
bers themselves are liable to use “language,” to
become convivial on occasion, and in general to
behave like human beings. Why should they set a
higher standard for individuals whose moral outlook
has nothing at all to do with their honesty and
capacity as turfites? The fact is, racing has devel-
oped into a vast national industry, and it is an
anomaly that it should still be run on the lines of
a conservative social club.
* * * --
“Tout” winds up the controversy: Re the
racing habits of Jack Rice. Bob Gray (now in
Indi»), who steered the gelding in Melbourne when
Ted Moon was not available, claimed that John’s
twist put his left arm out of action for days after
each ride. The only race in which the prad ever
went kindly here (Melbourne) was the Australian
Steeple. “P.’s” statement that “On three different
occasions he had races at his mercy when he ran off”
only confirms “J.’s” claim that Rice, owing to his
conformation, is a right-handed horse.
* * * *
“Abe” Davis, the one-time Flemington
trainer, is an inmate of the Old People’s Home at
Cheltenham (Vic.). Amongst other champions he
handled Grand Flaneur, the unbeaten son of Yatten-
don. Bill Long’s great horse won the Normanby
Stakes under Davis as a 2-year-old, and was then,
for some reason, transferred to Tom Brown. Brown
was responsible for the destruction of Long’s turf
popularity. He backed Flaneur early for the Cup,
which he should have won, spoiled the odds and
annoyed Long, who promptly scratched the animal.
The punters went mad. It would have paid the
big N.S.W. sportsman better, perhaps, to have stuck
to the old man whose race is finishing in the Vic.
Home,
* * * *
One of the maxims of Jack Casey, who
died in the “ould sod” recently worth £40,000, was
that there were 10 mugs in Ireland to every one in
Australia. And he found a few in Australia. He
began his career as a fielder at Flemington, with
practically no bank at all. With every race his
position got worse. Half-way through his clerk
cleared in a panic. Still Casey persevered, telling
clamorous winners that he was too busy to pay at
the moment but would do so after the last race.
In the last race he “laid” the favorite like a million-
aire, his yell of “I’m here and I’m betting” pealing
out then for the first time. ' The favorite lost and
Casey never looked back.
* * * *
“ Jacko”: William’Yeomans, who lives on
the N. S. Wales Western line, rode from Mudgee to
Sydney in 1865 to see George Parr’s eleven
meet a local team in the Domain. In that year
V eomaris piloted Kyogle into second place in the
Metrop. at Randwick. In ’7l he carried off the
Oaks with Formosa, and other victories included
the A.J.C. Derby and St. Leger on Kingsborough;
Champagne Stakes on Hyperion, and the Maribyrnong
Plate on Newminster Kingsborough and Hyperion
were among Hercules Robinson’s string. The best-
known property owned by Yeomans during recent
years was Grenfell (Launceston —-Hope), who carried
off eight hurdle races in succession in Sydney. After
he had let his admirers down in the V.R.C. Grand
National Hurdle he made good in the V.R.C. Doutta
Galla Hurdle race. The old battler is now a hack
on the station.

“5.5..” : Ted Whiting, who walked to Mel-
bourne Hospital the other day with four gunshot
wounds in his hoad and one in his body, inflicted by
nocturnal visitors, is an ex-pug of the third class,
\\ ho in the days when I considered a good scrap
rather better fun than a IVagnerian opera was reputed
to be the most formidable rough-up in Melbourne. The
doctor who investigated Whiting’s wounds said he
owed his life to a skiill as thick as an armor plate,
ai.d rather harder. This lends color to the story
told of him in his professional days, when he fought
by night and pushed a fruit-barrow by day. It was said
that one afternoon, when he had his barrow drawn
up in Swanston-street, a bolting horse struck a
hollow iron verandah post, which fell on Whiting’s
head. The pug, having given change, turned petu-
lantly to a constable at his elbow and said, “Gor-
struth, you needn’t crack a man— ain't I movin’ on?”
* * *
“Bill Bowyang”: Mick Rutherford was the
best lightweight in the Holy Land; but the man
who kept Australian stoush to the front was Sergeant
Ha.nian, of A.I.F. Headquarters, Cairo, who was shot
thi ough the foot soon after the landing at Anzac,
and always hopped on his sound limb. Hanran
fought 70 contests in England and Egypt and was
defeated only twice, when he was forced to meet
heavier men. He twice defeated the heavyweight
champ, of the British army in India and met all the
so-called champions from the Big Smoke.
“H. Harrington”: The Rutherford (B.
6/2/’l9) mentioned by “Gerardy” hails from Wrighc-
ville, near Cobar (N.S.W.). “Rinky,” as we used
to call him, was a fair boxer before the war broke
out, and was regarded as the local “fedder” cham-
pion. Colley Evans (better known as “Digger”)
is also a Wrightville lad. These two —Rutherford
and Evans —can be regarded as the best light men in
the A.I.F. If they meet the local money would be
risked on Rutherford. As Evans, in the opinion of
some good judges, beat Johnny Wilde, that shows
what the folks at home think of “Rinky.”
“Ziff”: Was watching a couple of
strangers in Bluegum's billiard saloon. Everything
was proceeding smoothly when the game was dis-
turbed bv someone inviting another onlooker to
come outside. The challenge was taken up, and,
on going out a couple of minutes later, I was met
at the door by the vanquished acceptor, whose face
looked as if it had been kicked seven times by a
draught stallion., I led him to the yard tap, and as
he mopped hi 3 face he remarked dolefully, “That’s
what a man gets for keeping his wife and children!”
* * * *
The schedule for the R.A.S. Jubilee Show
(Sydney) is out. Eveiy sort of animal and bird
that has appeared in the past is billed to do so
again and, in addition, there will be a couple of
classes for mules. There is a growing suspicion,
particularly amorgst returned Billjims who have
had business dealings with mules, whether in dry
Palestine or wet Flanders, that the “donk” has a big
Australian future before it. At the coming Show
there will be one lot of draught and another of light
mules. The light mule is no mean hack, and he is
ideally suited for long-distance sulky work.

Melbourne District Cricket lacked incident
last week. Souths made 314 for six v. Easts, A.
Kenny supplying a faultless 62. Dean played a
great innings of 148 for Richmond v. Norths.
Another stirring effort was Gibaud’s 75 for North-
cote, which included one hefty punch that just
missed clearing the pavilion.
Against Brunswick Schade (Footscray)
secured the paralysing average of eight wickets for
5. Bond, a returned Anzac, got the “hat trick”
against Caulfield. Both belong to the sub-district
grade.
* * » *
In the ’seventies just-dead W. O. Whit-
ridge (65, by the way) was a brilliant bowler. Those
were the days of poor turf, when wickets could be
taken at from four to five runs apiece; in at least
two seasons he headed the S. Australian averages with
about that fisrure. Though not swift, he had a
peculiar wristy action which caused storms of argu-
ment to rage round the question of its fairness. He
was one of the founders of S.A. Cricket Association,
and for a time its chairman, and much later he was
chairman of the old Inter-State Cricket Council.
Wicket-keeper Andy Ratcliffe gave away
only one bye in Paddington’s 298 v. Balmain on
Saturday. And his batting average is 28.17 for 12
innings. It looks like international form.

Northern Suburbs (Sydney) Clubs’ 24
hours’ reliability trial last week-end was a scorcher.
The boiling, broken track led from Crow’s Nest via
Mt. Victoria to Bathurst, cross-country to Goulburn,
Picton and Tom Ugly’s Point, to the starting-
point. There were 26 starters, 15 finished and eight
did it without loss of points. All the machines to
get through cleanly had side-cars, and five of them
were 7-h.p. Indians.
* * * *
L. A. Simpson, the new mayor of Parra-
matta, is a mighty sportsman. He was a cham-
pion bikist at one time. Later he took to horse-
riding and joined the Sydney Hunt Club. No more
determined performer ever went out with it, and
it contained some thrusters, too, in the days when
Michael Angelo O’Callaghan was the secretary.

This year’s Dunn Challenge Shield goes to
East Sydney. It was in doubt up to the last
event —the three-mile run. J. W. Cain (Easts)
arrived at the tape just ahead of the brothers M. J.
and H. Grandmange—time, 16min. 46sec. The
specialists were everywhere. W. W. Hunt won the
100yds. (lOsec.) and 220yds. (22 3-ssec. —-equalling
J. H. Leadley’s Shield record) ; R. G. Piggott (the
find, by the way, of the meeting) took the 440yds.
(53see.) and 880yds. (2min. 4 l-ssec )'; and
Francis Rule the hurdles—l2oyds. (16 l-ssec. —
equal to J. W. Fraser’s Shield record) and the
440yds. (63sec.). Ernie Austen walked a mile in
7min. 18sec. and three miles in 22min. 54see.
Forty-year-old Jock Smith jumped sft. Bin., and
Policeman C. T. Ferguson (who is 42) threw the
javelin 135 ft. 7in., the discus 92ft. 2in., and was
second in the 161 b. hammer throw.

At Rose Bay (Sydney) last week Norman
and Dick Longworth dead-heated (from scratch) in
the 50 yards handicap. On Saturday they re-swam
and Norman won in 25sec. They are brothers of
Billy Longworth—the champion who, in 1916, was
rash enough to explain why he hadn’t enlisted.
About three days later he was in khaki.

G. Massey (Southport) has just won the
Q. championship 100yds. sprint in 10 l-10sec., and
recently J. Gillen (South Brisbane) took the
100yds. swimming title in lmin. 2sec. Both are
schoolboys.
Glenelg (S.A.) has put up a record of a
sort, by prosecuting a married woman of great re-
spectability for “exposure” on the beach. The
coming-in of mixed-bathing has, contrary to all
wowsers’ forecasts, made for increased decorum, and
the old displays of living statuary seen on the
sands are gone for ever. The lady "in question was
one of two who found the new dressing-enclo-
sures too crowded, and dressed on the beach. She
wore a bathing costume, and when removing it put
on a gabardine coat. . But there was a wind blow-
ing, said the prosecuting constable, and £5 Bs.,
including costs. Her friend, who wore a kimono,
had to pay 16s. —a fine distinction.

“Leo Lear”: I encLrse “H.V.E.’s” remarks
(B. 30/l/’l9) on the table qualities of the common
eel. Even big fellows caught in muddy streams are
made palatable by parboiling before frying. The
West Victorian abo.’s method of cooking beats all.
He digs a shallow hole in the ground and heaps
ashes on top of the catch. If there is a more
heavily-stocked eel stream in Australia that Darlot’s
Creek, l’ve never met it. / The waters are crawling
with the slimy things. It is ideal eel country,
as the creek drains miles of marsh and swamp,
the Semi-dry Lake Condah and the famous Condah
swamp. The Lake Condah area was formerly Vic-
toria’s thickest aboriginally-populated district.
Those interesting humps, “blackfellows’ mounds,”
abound round all the water-courses and swamps, mark-
ing the camps of a race gone west. Game, water-
fowl and fish abounded when my ancestors settled
here in the wake of the Hentys. Blackfellows’ fish-
eries still remain on the smaller creeks and at the
mouth of swamps. These were made by building a
line of stones V-shaped across the stream, with an
opening* at the point to allow the wandering eel
access to a grass-made net.
* * * *
“Haka”: During the influenza epidemic
in Maoriland the authorities commandeered the Gore
racecourse buildings for an auxiliary hospital. After
examining one inveterate punter the doc. announced
“Racecourse in the morning.” “Cripes,” said the
i.p., “don’t send me down there, doctor. I’m a moral
to blow out on the Gore course.”
* * * *
Japan has an odd system of betting. The
successful tote-plunger doesn’t draw any cash win-
nings—only so many orders on the stores. So, after
a good day, a man might finish with a double-bed,
a suit of clothes, a new hat and a grand piano.
* » * *
“Tout”: Re “legs” (B. 20/2/T9). A
popular method is for the sharp to invite the mug to
take a hand at euchre. Of course they wouldn’t
dream of playing for money. Presently the mug
finds himself with four aces. Curiously enough his
opponents also have good poker hands. Betting
begins and at the show down one of the enemy pro-
duces a routine flush and collects.

At Gawler (S.A.), on Saturday, J. V.
Hopwood won the Hurdles on Mount Miltsin —his first
public appearance over the sticks. He rode at
1 Ost. 41b. in this event and then proceeded to win
the Flying Handicap on Placidia, carrying three stone
less. A record ?

Nearly £350 was collected by jockey G.

C. Paton, the lad who was killed in the Launceston

There was a light nor’-easter and an ebb-
ing tide on Saturday afternoon for the 16-foot
championship of the Port Jackson Skiff Club, and all
the boats piled on their canvas. Valete (H. Price)
argued the question of leadership with Dart (P.
Mills). Dart got her nose in front twice, but in
the run home Valete beat her and crossed the line
ahead with 40sec. in hand, taking the championship
by one point from Dart. Intrepid (E. Ellis) blew in
thirds and Stella (T. Barnett) fourth.

“Molar”: Re the suggestion (B. 13/2/T9)
that a cocaine injection might be a fair thing in the
case of a horse which goes lame in one foot just
before a' race. At the Plumpton, near here: (Mt.
Gambier, S.A.), a local chemist regularly supplies
cocaine for. coursing dogs with “risky” feet. His
fee is 10 bob. An ounce of cocaine costs £5. A
suitable solution for the above purpose would; work
out roughly at sixpence, and from it at least 16
injections should be obtained. It is better business
even than the doctors’ fees for inoculation against
the ’flu.

The Motor Yacht Club of N.S.W. held its
first meeting since the war began at Rose Bay on
Saturday. The placed boats in the “A” class event
were owned by (1) Reginald . Roberts, (2) Leslie
Holland, (3) L. Albert. And there was a time
when actors were classed as “penniless rogues and
vagabonds.”

American motor-race promoters have got
busy arranging their speed classics. The Indian-
opolis “500” has been set down for May 30 with a
prize list of £lO,OOO. Some unusual speeds (and
accidents) may be expected, as with the application
of the latest aero-engines there will be hardly a limit
to pace if the drivers can keep in their seats.

“B.B.” : How’s this for a day’s bag? A
lone fisherman on the Marine Parade, Napier (M.L.),
landed 41 sharks, using the same hook throughout
the labor of love. One of the catch was of the
tiger variety, heavy with 40 young tigers, each
about a foot long.
Rufe Naylor, mentioned in the cables
lately in connection with certain sensational
charges of bribery and corruption in South
Africa, began his business career as the cute
boss of a small bicycle shop in Wyalong
(N.S.W.).
This cocky-correspondent is feeling sore
about it: —•
I see in the paper that Australia’s score for the
wealth produced in 1916, less the interest on what
we owes, would equally parted up give £34 a head.
Now the Missus, three nippers an me counts five, and
our whack woud be £l7O, or over three notes a
week; an’ as I never had moren 30 bob all me
days, I been took down. And whose had me coin?
Not the toffs, there’s not enough of them to count ;
it’s these townies, getting from three to five notes
every Friday, spliced or single. Fancy single coves
who ought to collect about 155., if they took their
honest whack, having the hide to pouch three or
four notes. I’m fer the nationalisation of wealth
an’ all them single coves payin’ back to the likes
o’ me what they robbed us of.
THE DOWNFALL.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“A determined attempt was made on Tuesday
morning on the life of Edward Whiting, the Mel-
bourne ex-pugilist. No fewer than six revolver
bullets were found embedded in his head when he
was examined at St. Vincent’s Hospital, and only the
possession of an abnormally thick skull saved him.
He states that half a dozen men were concerned in
the outrage, and that they have been attempting his
life for vears. He is in no danger.”
They registered dozens of hits on his skull,
But the missiles failed to pass
As a “pipsqueak” fails on the steel-clad hull
Of one of the Dreadnought class.
The firing was practised for years and years
By squads of from two to six ;
All parties began to get bored to tears,
For the net results were nix.
Then someone thought of a workable scheme
And crossed Ted hard on the jaw,
And he went right “out” in a trance-like dream,
For this is the fighting law:
A pug with a head like a granite rock
Will frequently take, alas!
The deadest and suddenest sort of knock
Through having a jaw of glass.

“L.S.” JUDHPORES, 30/=
TAILOR-MADE TO ORDER
THE Judhpore is a combination of the ideas responsible
for the production of Riding Breeches and Riding
Trousers of the usual design. With Judhpores you get
the fullness at the thighs and almost the same close fitting
at the knees as are features of Riding Breeches of regu-
lation pattern. No leggings are needed. The design
obviates the necessity of using laces or buttons at the
knee. The garments can be pulled on as quickly and
easily as ordinary Riding Trousers. You therefore get
also the commendable features of the latter.
There is no doubt as to the handiness of Judhpores, and
they have more than justified their great popularity in
Australia. ,
We quote our “L.S.” Special Judhpores in Military
Drills at 30/= tailor-mt.de to order. Other materials are
obtainable up to £4.
SAMPLES ARE POST FREE
with tape, self-measurement form, copy of catalogue, etc. We

something to go on with : —•
There is an enemy within our gate, i
If we dispel him quick it’s not too late.
We must adopt some method up to date,
It should and must' he done ! Don’t trust to fate.
Think of the thousands who have met the foe
And died a lonely death, and been laid low.
There’s certain solace in the fact. We know
Who caused and is to blame for this sad blow.
The “Cabbage Patdh” a dirty trick has played,
Another to her list. Don’t be afraid —
AVe’ll have to fight this scourge without her aid.
We hope she’ll get some sense when she has paid.

ford: The thing that interested us most was the

P.A.D.: Poor stuff... .O.B.: Delightful fragment:—
If the Kaiser I could only hire,
I would make him perspire ;
To tie him to a waggon tire,
And to haul it through a stubble fire.
To engage him I would want a trial,
To watch him, to keep him up to style ;
For I would have him sinking holes in mire,
And if he stood up I’d touch him up with wire.
For by the end of the week
Another boss he would want to seek ;
Only to say what a treat,
But I had to humble, and meek.
. ...C.P.: “Safe Deposit” wanted much brighter
telling... .R.S. Y.S.: Metre goes all to pieces....
A.C.: Sonnets no use.... Inky: His “facts” are not
much worse than those of the historians; his gram-
mar would run a good race with a daily paper’s....

trouble. The little girl who is staring straight
over his heed has the look of a preoccupied lion.
Study... .J.C.H.: No value here.... Gecko: Nothing

prove your drawing and try to get some gaiety into
your work.... Harold L.: The ' wife isn’t . angry
with her drunken husband. She is merely astonished.
... .T.McD.: Don’t know where you could sell
Neptune’s Daughter. Why did you call her that?
She looks quite dry J.R.S.: Dashed to the floor.

placed, and the one in front of the mirror isn’t
joined on to her legs. . . .T.R.E.: You can’t drag that
in here by the ears... .H.0.W.A.: Bear them hence
in silence... .C.D.F.: Too young, too rough.. .. .P.S. :
The Office Brickbat has been fired at you.. .. J. 0.:
No need to protest. It is so dull that it must be
original.
Owing to a petty dispute the “darg”
system has been introduced with extra
energy at two N.S.W. South Coast mines,
the men being ordered not to earn more
than 12s. a day, which isn't much to live on.
If this doesn't answer, the order may go out
that each man is only to do enough work to
earn 6s. a day. Despite all denials it is
hard to,believe that day-workers don’t “go
slow" at the employer’s expense when piece-
workers can be ordered to “go slow” at their
r wn expense.

The woes of the Sydney counter-lunch
brigade are to be added to by a new order
regulating the sizes of “mugs” of beer and
the price thereof. The U.L.V.A. has issued
a circular which, in addition to making
compulsory the sale of all spirits by measure,
intimates that “pots,” i.e., 20oz. measures,
formerly sold for 3d., are no more ;
“handles” and “long glasses,” containing
about lOoz. and sold for 4d., and “mediums”
and “smalls” for 3d., have been substituted.
Regulation glasses and “handles” supplied
by the Ass. have been in general use in all
hotels since the order.
“Arthur R.”: A word with “Gleniris”
(B. 30/.1/T9), who tries to throw iced
water on my suggestion as to the suitability
of eucalyptus-distilling for returned soldiers.
He states that a small-priced plant produces
only low-grade oil. Admitted. This low-
grade oil, although discolored, is pure oil,
while that ordinarily purchased in shops is
only 36 p.c. to 40 p.c. pure. For the-crude
oil there is always a sale to the refiners, who
buy it in bulk and pay a fair price. My
suggestion was not for the establishment of a
large up-to-date factory with all the latest
machinery for turning out the finished
article, but for a small, one-man plant
consisting of a boiler, condenser and vat. A
square iron tank is generally the boiler,
while the condenser consists of a round cor-
rugated ditto with spiral piping running
the full length. This completes the plant.
The distiller I had in my mind when writing
started with no captal, and, although only
dealing with the low-grade oil, he now drives
his own motor-car, and it’s not a Ford either.
“D.F.”: Some idea of what bay-whaling
meant in the bad old days may be got from
a statement made by Gibbon'Wakefield that
in 1840 there were 69 whaling-boats, ex-
cluding those owned by Maoris, working
from Cook’s Straits, Hawkes Bay and the
South Island. This left out of account the
great deep-sea whaling centre of the Bay of
Islands and the northern part of the North
Island. Wakefield reckons that there were
650 men employed at the stations which he
deals with. There were more than that in
Tasmania when bay whaling was at its
height there, a little before 1840. Stations
were thick along the coast and on the islands
from Recherche Bay to Schouten Main and
away to the Bay of Fires. From 1830 on-
ward there were a good many also on the
coasts of Vic. and N. S. Wales, from .Port-
land to Twofold Bay.

“Trion’h; “Oldfield” (B. 6/2/T9) makes
a fuss about a steamer thief getting away
with his unguarded boots. Here’s a bit of
piracy worth writing about. It happened at
Port Said before the war. The drawing-
room steward had taken up the runners in
preparation for coaling, and had gone to the
gangway with a weather-eye open for possi-
ble absconders. Before he went he locked
Up the piano in the lounge. When he came
back about half an hour later the piano had
vanished. The thief who did that job would
have stolen “Oldfield’s” boots while he was
standing up in them.

For the return air-trip between Capetown
and Johannesburg (S. Africa) the fare is to
be £2O, while the business is raw and
• experimental. The distance there and back
is 1750 miles, or 1800 miles as the crow wmuld
fly if he were the bird he pretends to be, though
the railway covers several hundred miles
more. So the rate will be between 2Jd. and
2fd. per mile. The first-class fare between
Sydney and Bourke is between 14d. and lfd.
per mile, but the deficit is made up out of
taxes; whereas the Capetown-Johannesburg
affair, being a company, will have no tax-
payers to loot. On the same basis the
Sydney-Bourke rate would be a shade over
2d. a mile. The Capetown-Jo’burg air ex-
press is to save five days on the double jour-
ney as compared with the train, and if a
traveller’s time is worth £1 a day, it makes
the net fare £l5, or about 2d. a mile. The
permanent way (air is permanent), flying
stock and all appliances are reckoned at
about £5O a mile, and it will probably cost
a few shillings per mile to shift the whole
caboodle if the mines give out and Jo’burg
perishes off the map. Australia’s railways
cost over £lO,OOO per mile, and are nailed
down.

“J.G.” : I’d like to see eucalyptus oil tried
out as an illuminant. I have experimented
with it in an ordinary house lamp and found
that it gives a very bright greenish-white
light, and is consumed slowly. Of course the
oil I used cost much more than the same
quantity of kerosene, as it was the best
refined. But distilled oils should burn better
than the refined.
THE SIGN OF THE SERPENT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I walked the street, on naught intent,
But paused a while before a fine,
New underwear establishment.
Above the door a quaint design,
A rampant snake, I saw, with guile
And raffish humor in its smile.
The goods for sale were women’s wear.
Most apt the sign, as I perceive.
The snake in brazen beauty there
Must be the one that cozened Eve.
Forerunner of the modistes, note,
He introduced the petticoat.
Progenitor is he of all
The drapers and the drygoods clan.
He brought about our primal fall,
The adders all let loose at man;
And now, as when the world was young,
Eve hearkens, and is Adam “stung” !

Haven.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
FOB years I held Adventure’s heels,
And took with him the track that
reels
Forever down the night and day.
And each green island in the foam
Sang softly of my heart’s true home ;
And ever as I passed said ‘ Nay,
And faded far away.
From London to New England’s shore
I sped ; and beat upon the door
That opens on a strong man’s place.
In Boston, girdled green with trees,
I listened by the sing ng seas ;
But Truth had passed in, shy-eyed, grave,
And hid her changeless face.
In loud New York I built my towers;
I labored hot-head through the hours
And soon forgot my dreamer’s quest;
The full youth humming in my veins
Cried work and deeds for conquering brains;
And all the tinkling songs of rest
For mo sang: “Work is best.”
Old London smiled ; and called me back
To dim loved streets beyond the track
Of perils in the seas between,
To sunbeams on my mother’s lawn ;
To flowering orchards in the dawn
Down yellow roads all bordered green
Where quiet feet had been.
Again the master’s swift command—
I passed into a .fiery land.
Through Argentina’s desert red
I heard the vanguard cymbals beat
And built long railways in the heat.
But Truth had hid her golden head
And no least word she said.
Old London laughed ; and sang again
Of trees and fields and cool, white rain ;
Of niarht and quiet, easy day ;
Of well-loved anxious hearts at home
That follow eager hearts that roam ;
And watch the sunset lawn, and pray,
Where children used to play.
Truth might have spoken to me there
And given calm for self-made care ;
But in my blood the tireless voice
Called ceaselessly in rising tone
That restless hearts must fare alone
In storm and peril to rejoice
Down bitter roads for choice.
And all the bitter roads I trod
Unwearied and foolhardy shod
To seek and seek the last true word,
lu Paris sun and Moscow' rain,
Dim Belgium and New York again—
But never homing voice I heard,
Nor followed homing bird.
Brown Sydney’s arms outstretched at last,
And folded me and held me fast.
In narrow ways she kept me long ;
And hard and well she cleansed my heart
With tears I slied alone, apart. .
But one drew near me from the throng,
And called me, clear and strong.
And lnurmurously her voice sang sweet
And echoed in the mocking street.
She put a magic in my hand
And brought the eventide and dawn,
My mother’s eyes, her sun-red lawn;
Old voices from a far-off land,
And breezes, memory-fanned—
The Spanish blooms, the Russian walls,
The Boston trees when evening falls,
The years, the men I worked with then —
The colors fade to pen and ink ;
To happy black and white they shrink,
And all the tired-eyed, wistful men
Are ghosts that teach my pen.
Truth’s heart is deep. Her voice is low
As changeless music long ago;
And in her eyes all new dreams brood.
The roads all finished at her feet.
Down all the way, shy-eyed and sweet,
Unseen and near she always 5t00d....
Heart of me, God is good !
N.s.w.
HILARY LOETING.
The God in the Waterspout.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THE Divisional Officer at Sydney issued
in April, 1924, a report of unusual
interest. It told how a burst of in-
tense heat had rarefied the atmosphere of
Gentralia to an enormous extent just when
other influences had caused the atmosphere
north and south to become unduly deuse.
These denser atmospheres went rushing in
gradually-increasing circular sweeps towards
the centre, where the rarefied atmosphere
was incapable of resisting them. The rushes
collided, struggling for supremacy, swirl-
ing and gyrating in a series of whirlwinds of
cyclonic fury. Trees were torn up by the
roots, buildings swept away, lakelets dried
up, the water and the fish they contained
being sucked to the top of the cyclonic fun-
nel and swept leagues through the upper air,
to fall to earth again in waterspouts.
The public who read the story remarked
pleasantly that they were mighty glad it
happened in Gentralia. where only fools
lived.
Crushed by the weight of a great indem-
nity, forced to work long hours for miserable
pay by the economic results of a stupendous
national defeat, the German people began to
hate with terrific intensity not only the
authors of the ill-starred war, but even the
men who had played famous or infamous
parts in it. Above all, they hated those who
had been associated with the accursed sub-
marine policy. Unrestricted submarining was
a crime the world had neither forgotten nor
forgiven. It had roused a world-wide hatred
of everything German. German people and
German goods were alike anathema the earth
over. The people in the eyes of the world
bore the mark of Cain, and the goods they
made were stained with the blood of women
and children. .In 1920 the Germans found
they were paying in blood and sweat and
long hours for the submarining they had so
vigorously applauded in the days between
1910 and 1918.
No ex-submarine officer dared wear his
uniform in public. To do so meant asuault
an angry mob. Von Holtzendorf did not
realise it till lie had been badly beaten and
kicked twice in one week" then lie changed
into civvies. He also determined to change
his place of abode, and shifted from Hanover
to Dresden, where he believed nobody knew
him.
But Von Holtzendorf was a famous man
during the war. The successful destroyer of
nineteen large liners, his portrait had been
blazoned all over the Fatherland as that of a
man the Emperor delighted to honor. In two
horribly short years everything had changed,
and he had become infamous and the man
whom the people —or a lot of them —wanted
to stone. He hid himself in a walled-in
house in the suburbs and was never without
his automatic pistol.
He fled one night from Dresden, but as he
taxied to the station half a brick came
through the window, and he felt lie was not
leaving any too soon. He took train to Ham-
There a worse fate awaited hinu The
smell of the salt water, the sight of ships,
especially liners, and the maritime atmos-
phere recalled things he had been struggling
to forget. Suddenly the detestation in which
the people at large held ex-submarine officers
infected Holtzendorf himself. Conscience
got hold of him. He dreaded the dark, for
it was peopled with grisly things. lie sat
up all night in a room filled with glaring
lights, the windows of which were protected
by steel shutters painted to look like wood,
because he dared not sleep. Then through
the day he dozed fitfully.
The house he occupied overlooked one of
the big canals, and for that reason he care-
fully avoided the windows on that side ; but
one day a shrieking of sirens and a wild
clamor caused him to glance out. Bight
under his window a mob of people were
shouting and gesticulating, and then a stri-
dent voice roared, “There it is!”
Holtzendorf’s hair stiffened with horror
and his knees knocked together, as the body
of a drowned woman rose to the surface and
lurched in the wake of the steamboat that
had disturbed her.rest. As Holtzendorf stared
at this sight he could have sworn he saw
the right arm move and beckon to him —-
him, Holtzendorf!
lie howled in terror and collapsed. He
could see them all. They rose in the broad
daylight in a long accusing procession. One
of them was tugging at his neck. He struck
out wildly, and then a familiar voice broke
the spell. It was that of ins wife, wnom ae
had struck as she tried to undo the collar-he
Wore.
“You drink too much! You must stop!
You are in the horrors!”
He roared at her to pack up and get away
from the sea. No more would he ever get
near the sea ; no more would he look at a
ship. They were all haunted. And then he
collapsed and wept weakly, pitifully, in her
arms. She tried to soothe him as one soothes
a frightened child. Her Fritz was going
mad. She knew it. Under her breath she
cursed Kaiser and Tirpitz and the rest. She
must get him out of Germany—into some
land where even the language would be dif-
ferent. and it would be- all as a horrible
story he had read in a book. Ach, Gott,
where could she take him! All over Germany
now they threw stones at the men who had
done so much, dared so much, for the Father-
land—ungrateful pigdogs! The place was
accursed.
She took him to Munich, and hid him in
a walled-in house with a big garden and
trees in which the birds sang. She regulated
his supply of liquor, gave him bromides to
soothe him and iron and strychnine to build
him up. She wrote to relatives in Switzer-
land, in America, in Australia.
The Swiss relatives replied that on no
account was she to bring him there. They
were having a bad enough time as it was,
and an ex-submarine officer would make the
place too hot to hold them. The American
relatives did not reply. Then, after what
seemed to Frau Holtzendorf a dreadful time,
there came a letter from Australia. It was
sympathetic:—•
I am living in the very heart of the continent,
among what are called the Macdonnell Mountains.
It is a beautiful place, but to get him here it will
be necessary that his papers show him to be, if pos-
sible, a Scandinavian of some sort. Norwegian for
preference; if not that, then Swedish. Here he will be
so far from the sea he can forget it. If you can
travel by the aeroplane service from Paris, where the
English service stops, then he can be here in five
clays. The only salt water is a lakelet, 75 milrs
away, and a very little one. Do this and all w ill
be well. _ Here in this quiet and beautiful place, with
a charming garden in which to well, he will
soon be himself again.
After endless trouble she got him to Paris,
and then began the struggle for a passage in
the. great aeroplanes that had linked up the
British Empire. She had managed to estab-
lish his identity as an Alsatian who had
become crazed through his sufferings at the
hands of the Bodies during the war. He
trembled with terror at the thought of being
on a. British aeroplane. He cried weakly
that it would fly over the sea, and he would
be sure to hear the sound of the waves and
see the horrible ocean.
He went on board the aeroplane like a
man going to execution. He trembled
violently at the sight of a British uniform.
He swayed so that one of the aeroplane offi-
cers grasped liis arm : then, finding liow
weak he was, carried him to his cabin.
Once there his wife gave him a sleeping
draught, and made .up her mind that she
must keep him practically insensible during
the voyage, otherwise he would be sure to
betray himself.
In her anxiety over him she forgot every-
thing else. She had no idea whether they
passed over any seas, but when she was in-
formed that if he wished she could take her
husband out for two hours, she asked timidly'
where they were, and was astounded to find
they were in Egypt. She drew the curtains
and gazed over the landscape ; then covered
up the port hastily, for there, flashing in
the sunlight like a great sapphire, was the
blue Mediterranean.
It was a positive relief when the aero-
plane rose once more, and while he slept
under the influence of mingled drugs and
champagne, she glanced once more through
the port. It was the first time she had
dared to look out while in flight, and she felt
a great thrill. The giant aeroplane was
running thromrh sunset clouds, the coast of
Africa was fading into a crimson line. The

Do you rise in the morning with a groan? Do youjfeel tnat you are
getting old? Having made up your mind that you arefa martyr, do you
vent your ill-humor on the family? After a while, the pain and safeness
leave you, and you forget your troubles until the next morning, when
the same dull pain in the small of your back, the difficulty of bracing
your nerves, brings back all the dire forebodings of the ‘day before.
This is the way Kidney Trouble creeps on its victim, and you are
starting on a long journey towards ill-health and infirmity. The
Kidnevs are overtaxed with the work of cleansing ,p ut the impurities
from your blood. Each day there is an accumulaliim of waste which
must upset the body. It forms Uric Acid, and Uric Acid is the most
insidious form of poisoning that can take place i$ your body. . |“ e

Mediterranean still glowed like a vast sap-
phire. Then Yon Iloltzendorf stirred. She
drew the shade and hurried to his side, ready
to give him his soup if he awakened. But
he merely moaned and relapsed once more
into troubled slumber.
Again she was informed she could take him
out for a couple of hours, as they were in
Damascus. She roused him, made him
take his soup, then managed to get him on to
the deck, whence he could catch glimpses of
the. ancient city in the distance.
He was quite apathetic, and she began to
fear that he would die before she could get
him to Australia. He asked to be taken
back to bed, and she took him. In the
middle of the night he suddenly awoke,
clothed in his right mind, and, apparently,
free of his terror. He drew the shade
from the port and gazed out over the moonlit
Syrian desert, but it was so far below that
it was impossible to distinguish anything.
He conversed quite sensibly, and after dis-
cussion they decided it was better for him
to keep to his cabin. All he asked was that
when they approached any oversea flight he
should take a sleeping draught. To this
she agreed.
They left the aeroplane at some place with
a name that she could not pronounce, some-
where in the country called Queensland,
where they were to join another which flew
from Brisbane to Adelaide and on its way
passed the mountains called Macdonnell. But
it did not stop near their destination, only
at a place called Alice Springs; thence they
would travel by a motor-car, which Holtzen-
dorf’s uncle had said would meet them.
Frau Iloltzendorf was happy. Her
husband had arrived in the promised
land; all the seas had been safely
crossed, and he had not seen anything
of them. She cared not now how long
it took to reach those mountains—there
was no more sea, and her husband was vis-
ibly better. Lie seemed intensely interested
in Australia, and in a whisper informed her
that had the Fatherland won the war they
would have had a large estate somewhere in
it—the Emperor had willed it so, and given
his Imperial word.
“The Devil take him and his promises !”
said Frau Iloltzendorf, savagely. “Ilis
promises nearly cost you your life !”
. Next day she found herself at their destina-
tion, and she sat on the broad verandah of
a comfortable bungalow, and wondered if it
was all a dream that five days ago they
were in Paris. It seemed incredible.
Herr Morgenthau, Holtzendorf’s uncle, was
a. white-haired old gentleman who called
himself Morgan and spoke English without a
trace of German accent. He seemed in-
tensely anxious about his nephew’s health,
and long after Iloltzendorf had gone to bed
they sat up and talked of his trouble and
the. steps they must take to cure this mys-
terious malady, which seemd to be altogether
mental.
* * * *
Six months later found Mr. Holt in the
best of health. Bronzed by his life in the
open air, strong and lithe, he seemed to his
wife to have become rejuvenated. They
never spoke of the war, nor of the ocean,
nor of submarines, nor of anything to connect
them with the old life. Yet there were
nights when Mr. Holt could not sleep, and
would rise, light up, fill his pipe and read
till daylight. His wfife feared to inquire,
and watched him anxiously. But these
attacks lasted only one or two nights, and his
health remained unimpaired. Each month
the attacks grew less frequent, and their
length diminished also. Mrs. Holt folded
her hands and felt strangely at peace with
the world,
It was April 13, 1924. The day had been
sultry beyond endurance, and the night closed
down over the mountains without bringing
with it any relief. Mr. Morgan had been
at work on the freezing machine, and had
packed half-a-dozen bottles of lager around
with ice in a bucket, while Mrs. Holt made
a Municher salad. Suddenly there came
a long, low roar, like the noise of the wind
shrieking over the waters. Mr. Morgan
sprang to his feet i
“Quick! Close up the place—a cyclone!”
Mr. Holt sprang up and stood trembling,
“It’s the roar of the ocean, I tell you!”
and he shivered *o that he clung to the
table,
Next moment it was upon them. The
house rocked, the closed windows blew in,
and the room was full of flying water filled
with things—horrible, slippery things,
Mr. Holt cowered in the corner of the
room, staring at the table which was covered
with little wriggling fish; then at the floor,
over which a flood surged. Then the roof
went, and a flood of water poured down
over them, with more fish,
“It’s salt—it’s salt! It’s the ocean!”
screamed Yon Holtzendorf, rushing through
the gap that had once been a door,
Morgenthau seized his breathless niece
ond dragged her out to where a face of rock
would give some shelter. Throwm down
again and again, he struggled, and at last
they reached the shelter of the rock and
held fast.
In 20 seconds it had gone, and so had the
bungalow. The lawn was saturated and
also strewn with fish, and as she saw them
sb e dosed her eyes and shuddered. “And
1 brought him to it!” she wailed. Then,
starting up, she exclaimed; “We must seek
bim !”
They found him a hundred yards away,
face downward, surrounded by little heaps
of fresh-water fish, dead,
“They were whirled up from the nearby
streams!” said the old man when she babbled
of divine justice.
“But, uncle, the water teas salt—l tasted
it •’ And he came here, a thousand miles
from the sea, to escape the salt water!”
“Yes, yes—from the lakelet 70 miles away,
I told you of it, you remember?”
She bowed her head.
“Yes, yes ; it came from the lakelet. But
I brought him all the way from Germany
just to meet that water—that water carried
70 miles just to meet him....salt water
with fish....ach, Gott!”
She fell back fainting,

The Destroyer.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
IT was the peacefulness of the wattle-
fringed river-bend that brought the Nan-
keen Night Heron and his bride to the
, ~ f ~ , . A
ct on of the o.d dead gum-tree as a site
for their first nest. Here they spent the
golden days of their honeymoon. Here they
hatched their ungainly brood.
Father Heron, resplendent in his new plu-
- , ’ , , 1
mage ot lovely purple browns, shading to
creamy white on breast and legs, his dainty
shanks of soft chrome, wearing his smart
cap of navy-blue adorned with two long
i.r . , , v
w ite delicate plumes reaching to the back,
was most energetic, in company with his
pretty little wife, in supplying the wants of
the clamorous family in the big nest.
. On the one side the river crooned lazily
m golden shallows over its sandy bars ; on
tho other a reedy billabong rang with the
chorus of many frogs. Beyond, stretching
in gold brown and green, the reedy flats
spread out towards the ethereal blue of the
distant ranges.
A happy hunting-ground, yielding abun-
dant fare to the keen gold eyes and long,
quick bills of the energetic pair, whose pride
and ambition were centred in the fulfilment
of the promise of spotted wings stretching
over the rough nest side.
All around—in the ferny thickets of the
river-side where the blue wrens hid their
cosy nests ; deep in the watery little caves
under the banks where the platypus tended
her strange young; down in the feathery
reed-beds where the warblers wove their
grassy homes on scaffold-poles of the swing-
ing stems; out on the green scum of the
swamp, all aflic-ker at evening with the white
tails of water-hens; high up in the lofty
white-gum where the policemen magpies
fussed over their strident brood—the busi-
ness of mating and nursing went blithely on
through the soft Australian Spring.
Not without certain exciting incidents;
for, in some brief interval of providing,
bather Heron, from the topmost bough,
would watch with satisfaction the harrying
and buffeting of some ill-intentioned swamp-
hawk by the magpie couple.
Lazily flapping over the watery flats, on
mischief intent, the harrier would approach
within the prohibited distance until, with in-
dignant shrieks, two black-and-white aerial
torpedoes would be launched from the citadel
in the white gum, driving from above and
boJow with rapier thrusts until the battered
intruder, with eccentric flight, would disap-
pear over the marsh to seek the sympathy
nt his fierce-eyed spouse. Or sometimes in
the gloom of the wattle-groves excited chat-
termg from the garrulous honey-eaters, with
shrill assistance from a host of feathered
midgets, would mark the baiting of some be-
wildered boobook owl.
* * *
The first hint of real trouble came one
bright morning in the shrill alarm notes of
the magpies, followed by much indignant
chittering from the spick-and-span black
fantails whose cup-shaped nest graced a
feathery wattle-bough. Then old Daddy
Kookaburra was heard uttering loud and
indignant “koo-warrs” from his doorway in
his dead limb, punctuated by staccato hoots
from his indignant wife indoors.
The halcyon peace of the hush commu-
nity began to be pervaded by a vague unrest,
a sense of foreboding and uneasiness. Later
on on that fateful day a strange white struc-
ture rose to the sound of much chopping and
human profanity. Anxious father and
mother birds prospecting along the river
were rudely disturbed by strange beings of
loud and disconcerting habits.
The Destroyer had entered into Arcadia.
Down by the new and clumsily-erected
tent a pale-faced town youth, attired in
slouch hat and wild-colored leggings, was
fitting together a cheap Belgian shot-gun.
His companions, busy with tin-opener and
frying-pan, were upsetting the peace of mind
of the tenants of the neighboring leafy tene-
ments with vile and strange odors. “You’ll
soon be through with that tucker!” proudly
declared he of the leggings. “I’m going to
keep this camp in game for the future, and
beat the butcher, you be't!”
Father Heron, although in a most uneasy
frame of mind, was forced to be busy with
the ever-pressing need of his rapidly-grow-
ing family.
In a quiet little pool, dappled with the
crimson and gold. of the sunset, lie was
watching with great interest the movements
of certain delicacies, when a deafening crash
from the bank above sent him witli wildly-
beating heart in flurried flight. Swinging
with hurrying; erratic wing-beats across the
river-shallows, lie rose in graceful circles
above the trees, bis bright breast rosy in the
light of the west.
Then with a hoarse cry of dismay he dip-
ped towards the billabong. Far below was
the town-bred youth in breathless pursuit of
his beloved wife, who, with piteous cries
and trailing wing, was struggling to escape
into the reeds. As he swung nearer she
raised her head and saw him, and strove madly
with futile leaps to join him in the air.
Forgotten was his own safety. In a rage of
anger and solicitude he swept towards the
murderer, uttering loud cries of pain and
dismay.
“Look up, Jim!” yelled an excited voice
from the bushes. “Mere’s another bloomin’
crane right over yer.”
“Bang !” went the cheap Belgian gun, and
Father Heron came down a crumpled, man-
gled relic of lost beauty at the feet of his
destroyers.
“Boshter feathers them birds has.” re-
marked the sportsman that evening as they
cooked the evening meal. “I’ll take ’em
home to Lizzie for her new ’at”
Away in the rough nest in the old gum
pathetic eyes watched through the weary,
hungry hours —weaker and weaker—till
silence fell again on the quiet little river-
bend beneath the wattles.

Get at the cause of your illness.
It is a waste of time trying to cure
the symptoms when the cause is
deep-rooted. If } t ou suffer with back-
ache or weak back, headache, ner-
vousness, gravel, urinary disorder,
irregular action of the heart, dizzi-
ness, retching, pale complexion, etc.,
stop and think. “What causes my
trouble ?”, “ Why am I ill ? ” Let us
tell you. These are symptoms of
kidney trouble. You may have only
one of these symptoms, and your
neighbor another, for kidney trouble
affects different people differently.
But at the first sign of anything
wrong with your health find out the
cause, and treat the cause. Nearly
every ill “ the flesh is heir to” is
due to disordered kidneys. There-
fore, when you don’t feel as well as
you ought, look after your kidneys

Backache and Kidney
Trouble.
TWO SYDNEY PEOPLE CURED.
Mrs. G. Gavin, Wanstead-street, Undercliffe,
Sydney, says :—“For about four years I suffered a
good deal from backache and kidney trouble, and
only those who have been afflicted in this way will
have any idea of what I went through. The pain
in my back was so severe that I could hardly
move, especially in the morning, wffien it was often
almost impossible for me to get out of bed without
assistance. Other symptoms of kidney trouble were
bad headaches and dizzy attacks, both of which
were very trying. I was treated by a doctor for
some time, and also tried different kidney remedies
I saw advertised, but nothing did me any good.
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills were at last brought
under my notice, and they proved to be the very
thing I wanted. After taking one bottle I felt ever so
much better, and nine bottles of the pills cured me
completely, and I have been free from pain ever
since. It is eight years since I took Doan’s Back-
ache Kidney Pills, so my cure has been well
tested.”
Mr. F. W. Martin, Hastings, 50 Despointes
Street, Marrickville, Sydney, says:—“About two
years ago I took a course of Doan’s Backache’s
Kidney Pills for a severe attack of kidney disorder,
and they permanently cured me. Previous to using
these Pills I had a lot of trouble with my back; it
was very stiff and always aching. At times it was
only with difficulty I could get .about, and if I
stooped the agony in standing up straight again
was awful. I was also subject to dizzy attacks,
and felt constantly tired and languid. I heard of
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills through a friend, so
got some at once, and they suited me splendidly,
and restored me to perfect health. I am Stillwell
and have been since Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills
cured me about two years ago.”
Mr. Martin confirms his previous statement
two years later: “I have had no trouble with my
kidneys since Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills cured
me four years ago.”

POWER at full throttle for hours at a stretch.
An even MIXTURE at all altitudes and positions
—now at sea-level and horizontal! in a few
minutes, at 20,000 feet and ascending vertically;

be good enough for your Engine, and that Car-
