The Week’s Best:-
POWYS TO HIS
PUBLIC
For half a life-
time John Cow-
per Powys has
earned a living
lecturing to society ladies and others in
the United States. The effect of this
on Powys is plain in his childishly
verbose, pitifully self-pitying and, in
places, brilliant, even beautiful, Auto-
biography.
Son of a parson of Welsh ancestry
(apparently there was no mother; at
least, he does not mention her), Powys
had his education at Weymouth and
another place or two before going to
Cambridge. Later he was in Europe, at
Brighton (lecturing girls), in America
(performing what he calls “circus” stunts,
and which were doubtless extraordinarily
brilliant lectures: the U.S.A.’s greatest
living writers attended them voluntarily),
back in England (doing, of all things,
win - the - war - talk - performances in a
scheme of Lloyd George’s), and then
again in America (where he told a lot
of society ladies that he was not at the
war because he was afraid of the German
bayonets and was at once ostracised:
the real reason was that he shuddered
from performing an ordinary natural
bodily function in public).
He is obsessed with this last trouble,
and he seems to think it important that
the world should know all about it. His
detail of it is as creditable to his con-
science as it might be boring to most
readers—even those, like the present
writer, who consider A Glastonbury
Romance one of the three great novels
of this century. His self-pity in this and
other things is so weakly—it is almost
snivelling—that it may be a symptom of
decline. The whole wordy work is satu-
rated with it. It drip’s. He twists and
shudders with the thought that when a
boy he tortured worms. He also gave
cheek to little girls! But (saving grace)
he protected one little girl by throwing
stones at a lot of bully boys!
All his life, he confesses, he has
suffered from the most dangerous of all
vices: sadism. This sort of thing: “I
cannot remember a time —so ea'rly did
this tendency show itself —when sadistic
thoughts and images did not disturb and
intoxicate me. One of my picture-books,
when I could not have been more than
three years old, contained a picture of
an eagle seizing upon a lamb ; and from
the age of three, that is to say from the
year 1875 —for 1 was born in 1872 —till
about the year 1922, when I was fifty,
this deadly vice transported and obsessed
me. As a boy and as a young man it
had greediness for its rival, and much
longer than that it had a more normal,
though never altogether normal, attrac-
tion to young women as its companion-
vice ; but it was not till I was 50, and that
date remains very clear in my mind, that
I entirely overcame it. By overcoming
it I mean never allowing myself to derive
pleasure even for a
moment in those
sad i s tic thoughts
w h’i c h were my
bosom houris, the
attendants at my
pillow for nearly
half a century!”
Not less than half
the 600-large-page
book is in that in-
glorious mood ; an-
other quarter is
worse. Yet this
troublesome book is
worth while for the
other quarter, which
isn’t sliced off like a
piece of lemon, but
comes out in the
author’s bursts of
objective writ ing.
There is nothing in
all its pages to com-
pare with the beauty
of even a kitchen de-

scription in Glastonbury, but in the early
part the earth and the loveliness of Eng-
land break through in those occasional
glorious bursts—mostly not more than a
sentence or two long—and in this part,
too, if it is wretched beyond pity as auto-
biography, there is packed as neat a bio-
graphy of a man —his father—as anyone
could wish to read. Powys contrasts his
own poor self against this Welsh rock of
a man with unforgettable effect.
As an observer of the scene before
him Powys —apart from the early pages
of that England out of which he made
Glastonbury- —is as good as stone blind ;
though, since he has lectured before
hundreds of them, this observation might
thrill their kind in Australia: “But . it
does seem to me a sorrowful commentary
on human nature how snobbish, how ex-
clusive, how supercilious any literary
clique tends to become.”
In this, too, he embodies a thought
that may have occurred to others who
prefer thinking for themselves to accept-
ing the sort of pacifist rubbish that
Australians have been getting lately from
sundry eminent and allegedly eminent
persons : “In those days I used to think
quite a lot about this business of Paci-
fism and Pacifists. The ones that were
cruelly treated and badly beaten up I did
feel sympathetic with, but there were
others that in my devilish self-knowledge
I deeply suspected of using their perfectly
rational principles to dodge the irrational
plunge into the burning crater. What
would really have happened, I asked my-
self, if a nation, like this great formid-
able German nation —that alone was so
nearly a match for the whole Orbis Ter-
rarum — had found all the other races
prepared to be invaded and dominated
and exploited and trodden upon, because
of their principles of
pacifism and of
philosophical spiritu-
ality?”
A curious book,
and not easy to crys-
tallise. It is the
autobiography of a
genius bent upon
presenting himself to
the world as a shame-
ful spectacle. His
lectures must have
been extraordinary
things, worth crawl-
ing over broken
bottles to listen to ;
this is what they
were to him: “Yes,
the platform has
been everything to
me. It has been the
bed of my erotic
joys. It has been the
battlefield of my
fiercest struggles. It
has been the gibbet of my execution. It
has been the post of my scourging. It has
been my throne. It has been my close-
stool. It has been my grave. It has been
my resurrection. On the platform I have
expressed by a whisper, by a silence, by
a gesture, by a bow, by a leer, by a leap,
by a skip, by the howl of a wolf, by the
scream of a woman in travail, certain
inspirations concerning the secrets of life
that, without any vain boasting, I do not
think have been expressed very often in
this world.”
That paragraph is possibly as neat a
crystallisation of the book as could be
given—a fierce brain screaming in a tor-
turing hysteria.
The whole explanation of the book,
however, may be put into four words —
ulcers in the stomach.

Frightfulness
Gas! by Major-
General C. H.
Foulkes (Black-
wood ; 305.), is
more horrifying than any war-book
that the writer has struck because
its author never hesitates to tell the whole
truth. War remains glamorous chiefly
because most war-historians, -novelists,
-playwrights and -scenarists concentrate
on its heroic, romantic or comic aspects,
and spare their public’s feelings with
regard to, what went on in (say) a raid
where orders had been given to take a
limited number of prisoners.
May, 1915, when Major-General
Foulkes became gas adviser to the 8.E.F.,
until the Armistice, he dedicated his life
to poisoning, asphyxiating and burning
Germans ; and no one who studies his
modest, simply-told, carefully-docu-
mented story will deny that he was the
right man in the right place.
He quotes a common complaint: “Our
gas is no bloody good; you can’t even smell
it.” His answer is to reveal its effects
on the evidence of deserters,- prisoners,
captured documents and raiding parties.
One [raider’s] report said: “Many dead
Germans were in the dugouts, apparently
caught asleep”... .and another: “Forty
Germans were found in one dugout either
unconscious or dead....At least 80 dead
bodies were lying in the trench.”
A deserter (one of a platoon of 37
men of whom “17 were gas'sed, 10 died
on the ground and the remainder never
returned”) heard a chaplain say at Ostend
that
The Division had to deplore the loss of
700 men dead after the recent gas attack,
who had been buried in the Division sector.
This was apart from gassed cases sent to
Ostend and Bruges, of whom many died
en route.
As chemical warfare developed, the
Special Brigade (Major-General Foulkes’s
unit) produced new devices. Thermit
(powdered aluminium and iron oxide),
whose inflammability was such that it
could set fire to wet grass, was used
before assaults.
The cascades of molten metal descending
on the heads of the enemy at these stirring
moments provided a magnificent spectacle
and nine hours later when the targets were
examined, many bomb fragments were
found. One dugout was burning fiercely,
as well as a heap of clothing, and a number
of dead Germans were found covered with
burns. The dugout was still alight 24
hours later, and although it was largely built
of concrete all the wooden ribs, frames and
linings were still aglow.
The major-general saw it stated recently
by a “distinguished public man” that

A MODERN NOVEL OF AUSTRALIAN CITY LIFE
roßiy-nx
*
PRICE 6/-
Plus 3d. Postage.
FORTY-SIX
By STEWART HOWARD.
A modern novel of Australian city life, set in Sydney at the present day,
it states the problem of a normal, active, virile man whose amatory excursions
catch him enmeshed in a closing net of feminine possessiveness. Three women—
his wife, his mistress and a new flame —have their hands to the net; the problem
of Dick Westring is how he might cut the painter and escape.
The author is a young writer who has seen this aspect of modern Sydney life.
Its hectic atmosphere, cocktail parties, promiscuous amorousness, are as actual
and true to life as that sunlit scene of its near coast which makes a moderating
splash of beauty in the novel’s texture.

phosgene was “as antiquated in modern
warfare as the blunderbuss.” No soldier
will agree. The German General
Schwarte considers that of the 25 gases
used by the British phosgene and mustard
gas were the most effective ; prussic acid
was relatively harmless. Phosgene was
mostly used with chloropicrin—“a lethal
compound causing inflammation of the
respiratory organs, like chlorine and phos-
gene, but with a degree of toxicity some-
where between the two.”
Chloropicrin produced an intolerable irri-
tation of the eyes, as well as coughing
and vomiting; so that even when the
masks were in position the enemy would
be compelled to remove them and expose
himself to the full toxic property of the
gas, as well as to the phosgene which it
was intended to discharge at the same time.
Phosgene remained Britain’s main
battle gas from its introduction at the
first Somme till the Armistice for the
following reasons: —
(1) It is “more than 300 times as toxic
as carbon monoxide.”
(2) Unlike chlorine, “it can be breathed
in fatal doses without undue discomfort or
coughing.”
(3) It has a remarkable delayed action
(death often occurring when the gassed
soldier thinks he is out of danger), and
death sometimes follows “when only a
whiff or two has been inhaled.”
There can be no doubt, on the revela-
tions of this book, that gas will be the
principal weapon in the next war. The
American gas casualties amounted at
times to “65 p.c. of their total battle
casualties,” and German h.q. were de-
manding gas for 50 p.c. of their artillery
ammunition in 1918. When the Armis-
tice arrived the Americans alone had
planned to produce ten times as much
gas of certain sorts as the whole of the
German plants were capable of making.
Phosgene shells were being demanded
for the British 18-pounders, and in the
opinion of the infantry three-inch Stokes
mortar phosgene bombs were more use-
ful than h.e. in attacks on pill-boxes.
Lord Cavan refers to a little-known
fact in a short introduction. The Air
Forces of all the armies refused to use
gas throughout the war.
J.D.
Baylebridge’s
Sonnets
It was in a cen-
tury long past
that there were
men in buckram.
Their English was
not ours: rich
and full, it seems to us also mannered
and remote. Yet there are some writers
to whom the language of the past is a
natural thing. They use it even when
rejecting it. Thus William Baylebridge,
in the preface to a second edition of his
exhilarating aphorisms in National Notes,
writes that he is glad of an opportunity
to present his opinion in “a less rigid and
coercive dress.” He is not indeed unduly
coercive, this stately man in buckram,
but rigid, in comparison with modern
writers of verse and prose, he certainly
seems. Yet he is a man of our time, and
a man looking passionately forward:
“Let not the present live,” he urges, “at
the cost of the future.”
When such a writer publishes a book
of love poems, it is natural that they
should be sonnets, and Shakspearean
sonnets at that. Love Redeemed, a
sequence of 123 sonnet's (Tallabila Press,
Sydney), has already been considered, in
MS. form, by the writer of that unex-
pected book published some years ago,
Queensland Poets, by R. Kellow. The
poetry of William Baylebridge is the text
for a striking chapter in that book, and
great stress is laid upon the philosophy
behind the sonnets. All I can hope to
do here is to suggest their nature as
poetry.
The sonnets are an inquiry into the
nature of love, an inquiry helped,
not hindered, by the formalism of the
whole series, of the individual sonnets,
and of single lines framed for rhetorical
sequence:
What is this love her worth hath bred
in me ?
A vague combustion, brief to prove as
bright ?
O, a charged river flooding to its sea,
That hath from many a fountain ta’en
its might!
So begins LXXIX. And thus concludes
one near to it ;
In whom I love Nature must act and
fashion —
No shift of a convention, creed or code.
Where then, this violence spurning,
shall I find
The bird unsnared in its contracted
mesh —
That one (how blest!) who warpless
shows in mind
And rears no prurient mystery in her
flesh ?
O where hut in my sweet ? Ay, few that
stir
Hath Nature made and held so true to
her.
It is usual to test sonnets by quoting the
last line. A crown of sonnets can be
made of last lines. With those in the
Shakspearean mode, though, we quote
the last couplet. Here are couplets from
Love Redeemed, and notice how the
archaic phrases have their own freedom
for this writer:
Too fond, look to it! Character in life,
Ev’n as in love, must bring the crown
or knife.
No handling’s rough for Jack — who’ll
swell, make free,
Where ev’n the lord he apes might bend
the knee.
This world, for love like ours, is much
awry ;
Is the mad world, then, or is love, a lie ?
For all its pageantry of ancient words
and themes, Love Redeemed is an indi-
vidual expression of strong feeling in this
century and in this country. The first
sonnet places it here, with our southern
calendar and its “naught-exempting rape
of June.” The images—one could wish
them more frequent—are our own: the
southerly, “the gums, and ghostly those,”
a bushfire:
All day there, a dun arras washed with
rose,
The smoke has sealed the south; the
abated sun
Firm-rondured —like a ball of blood it
shows—
Sinks, and the fumid skies to opal run.
In such passages there is an extrava-
gance of archaising, yet they ring true
and are a part of the peculiar harmonies
intended by this poet. From each
genuine writer comes what he alone can
give, and William Baylebridge has his
own utterance. At times, borne onwards
by his formal skill, his phrases and
periods are abstract, legal and, to me,
obscure. They were not obscure to this
poet, or he would have denied them
room. One returns to the balanced
beauty in innumerable passages, as in
this couplet:
Thus holds the happy lover. Laugh who
will —
They have their jest; his joy he keepeth
still.

Encouraging
Authors and
Artists
The aver age
freelance news-
paper contributor
writes or draws
not merely fox-
pleasure, but to
earn money.
Authors and artists have to eat, sleep
and clothe themselves just like other
people, and they have to pay their way.
The Bulletin and all newspapers asso-
ciated with it realise this and pay the
outside contributor a fair price for all
work accepted. So do some other papers,
but there are those that appear to think
the freelance contributor is a person who
has discovered a way of living in which
money is unnecessary.
A well-known Queensland weekly paid
me Is. 8d. for a 19-line par. The cost
in postage for sending the par., claim
and receipt to the newspaper was 6d.;
the cost of the newspaper another 6d.
(the cutting having to be forwarded to
the office before payment would be
made). The profit on that par. was 8d.,
less the price paid for envelopes, paper
and the wear and tear of the typewriter.
Still, that famous newspaper was
generous compared with some others to
which I have contributed. Nothing is
the magnificent price paid for accepted
matter by quite a lot of Australian pub-
lications ; if the contributor complains
of the treatment received the newspaper
replies that it does not pay for matter
contributed by other than members of the
staff: it merely accepts to give encour-
agement to young authors and artists.
I may be a trifle thick-headed, but I
fail to see what encouragement' the
young author or artist gets from that
sort of treatment. Probably some of
those who have received the encourage-
ment claimed would enlighten me.

A Satchel of Books
Earthquake in the Triangle, by Lewis
Gibbs (Dent; 7s. 6d.). A record of the
emotional upheaval of a staid doctor of
46 against a background of the general
strike in England. Good work, remark-
able for its keen psychological insight,
its writing and its compactness. The
action takes place over a period of about
16 hours, yet Gibbs has succeeded in
giving us a vista of 20-odd years, years
which have changed the principal char-
acter of the novel and have changed,
slowly but surely, the Triangle itself, that
backwater which was once the most de-
sirable residential quarter of the district.
May not arouse a storm of popular en-
thusiasm, but it’s good.
The Old Model School, by J. Alex.
Allan (Melbourne University Press;
10s.), is the story of the first national
school in Victoria. Founded in 1852,
closed down in 1904, leaving a great
tradition, the school was for both sexes,
which were rigidly separated, exception
being made in the case of the infants’
class. A teachers’ training college was
part of it, and here again mid-Victorian
barriers kept the hes and shes apart, not
always successfully. The list of famous
Victorians who passed through the school
is a long one. A few among many who
made names for themselves were George
Turner, politician and financier ; Charles
Gavan Duffy, Frank Tate and Bertram
MacKennal, and, on the “female” side,
to use the old school phraseology, Mary
Hannay Foott and Nell Stewart.
The Writers and Artists’ Year-Book,
1935 (Black, London ; Australian price,
ss, 3d.), now in its 28th year, is a direc-
tory for writers, artists and photo-
graphers. This edition cdntains all the
old features and, in addition, information
on play censorship, fuller details con-
cerning the markets for plays and films,
and a glossary of terms used in printing
and publishing. Australian freelances
wanting information on overseas markets
will find it extremely valuable,

“M.G.”: Vic. Book Censorship Aboli-
tion League promises to be a force against
the tomfooleries of the Customs Depart-
ment in the near future.' The league is
bigotedly non-political and non-sectarian,
and aims solely at leaving the porno-
graphic and the seditious to be dealt
with by the police under common law.
The eccentricities of Customs censorship
are too well known by this time to need
stressing, though the recent speech of
a prominent church dignitary in support
of Huxley’s Brave New World has
caused many indifferent people to realise
that there is good reason to kick against
a system which denies people the right
to learn the truth or the views of modern
philosophers.
“Cluan”: Masefield —if correctly re-
ported—was not thrilled by “magic case-
ments.” He was said to have declared that
Australia’s greatest poet is “Banjo” Pater-
son, with E. J. Brady as a runner-up.
One can understand Masefield over-
rating the singer of chanties (personal
preference will disguise itself as critical
insight) ; but why is “Banjo” Paterson
raised to this proud eminence? In a
review of Australian literature in an early
issue of the “Lone Hand,” 8.P., as a
poet, was said to have had but two
moments of imagination—when he
watched the swans’ western flight at even-
tide and when, for an instant, the moun-
tain locomotive appeared to be a sentient
thing. To these might be added later the
wonder of the gulls when Harry Hawker
flew the Atlantic. Evidently, it takes a
poet to recognise a poet.
“E.F.”: “J.D.,” reviewing The Thirty-
ninth (R.P. 16/1/’35), the history of
the Ballarat Battalion, doesn’t remember
to have seen elsewhere
a complete battalion
nominal roll with casual-
ties. As the author of The
Thirty-eighth Bat talion,
A.1.F., the Bendigo unit
that rubbed shoulders with
the Thirty-ninth from
Messines to the Hinden-
burg line, my toughest job
was compiling for publi-
cation a similar nominal
roll. My trouble was to
put the right John Brown
or Bill Smith amongst the
deceased Browns and
Smiths. Incidentally, my
battalion in its history
credited the Thirty-ninth
with the capture of the
first prisoner taken by the
Third Division. The
Thirty-eighth was pub-
lished soon after the war
(1920). W. M. Hughes,
then Prime Minister and
member for Bendigo,
obliged with a foreword.
The Bulletin had kindly
things to say about this

street building.
A Choice of Verse:—
DUSK AND CICALAS.
Unfasten your girdle of bells and jewels,
Let slip your saffron gown.
Thrushes once clad you in silver calls
And you found they had bound you and played
you false —
Now you are gowned in cicalas and saffron,
Tremble and lay you down.
Cry if you will, but the gums are shrill,
Cruel with jewels and bells ;
Cry if you will, but the gums are shrill,
Fell with a gleam that falls
And bright as any rain that jangles down
Amongst the nets and crazy shimmering walls
You wear the maddening dewtime as a gown.
Fall with a cry; oh, fall and glitter,
Now you are shower-bright, chained with rain.
Dus\ is hus\y, now dus\ is bitter —
Nobody, nobody tells!
Now you are snared in cicalas and saffron,
Unfasten your girdle of bells.

THE MYSTERY NATIONS.
What is going on in Russia? What is
going on in Germany? No foreigner
really knows. The Russian and German
workers don’t know either, though many
no doubt suspect.
Hitler is said by those who have met
him to be a man of goodwill, a lover of
the human race, even a pacifist. But so
were the original French revolutionaries ;
disciples of Rousseau, who believed that
man was naturally good and had been
spoiled by civilisation.
Eminent Britons who have met Stalin
—Shaw, Wells, Russell—praise his ideal-
ism and high intelligence. But there is
plenty of evidence that some of the
Caesars were charming people till they
had ruled for considerable periods.
Claudius was Emperor for nearly 10
years before he showed signs of becom-
ing a monster.
Germany seems to be ruled not by the
Leader but by a few members of the
General Staff, just as the real rulers of
France during the Terror were a few
members of the Revolutionary Tribunal.
Hitler is understood to be popular with
the masses largely because he opposes,
to the best of his ability, the violent
policies of the General Staff. But he
couldn’t save General Schleicher or the
General’s wife and hundreds more, and
he couldn’t prevent the persecution of
the Jews. Stalin, for his part, allowed 66
people to be sentenced to death, and
executed a few minutes later, for the
assassination of Kirov, though, admit-
tedly, none of them had been near Kirov
at the material time. Hitler and Stalin
may not be cruel by nature, only fright-
ened. Under Fascism and Communism,
rulers can only hope to avoid death by
putting the fear of death into possible
enemies.
If the Soviet Government and the
Third Reich are not pursuing the same
policy as the Roman Senate did under
the worst of the Caesars, and as the
Revolutionary Tribunal did in the
Terror, then appearances wrong them.
Influential members of both bodies
clearly go in fear of their lives. They
can’t complain at home or abroad ; to
do so would mean death for (in the
words of the U.S.S.R. formula) “organis-
ing against the Government.” When
Camille Desmoulins found himself in
this predicament he registered his pro-
test by describing in the “Vieux Cor-
delier” what had gone on in Rome under
Nero. The rulers, he wrote, “trans-
formed into crimes simple glances, com-
passion, even silence. It was compulsory
to exhibit joy on the death of a friend,
even a kinsman, if one did not want to
perish oneself... .It was at least essen-
tial to wear an air of contentment; there
was fear that fear itself might imply
guilt.”
The Parisians understood ; the “Vieux
Cordelier” sold out on the spot.
The Government understood also;
Robespierre persuaded the Revolution-
ary Tribunal to have the paper burned,
and Desmoulins was presently sent to
the guillotine where, incidentally,
Robespierre soon followed him.
It is happening all over again in
Russia and Germany. In Moscow a
child betrayed her father, who was exe-
cuted. In Germany, according to a
writer in the “American Mercury,”
papers are appearing which contain
“quotations from the burned books,
from Heine through Gorky to the
worker writers.”
They often lie inside the legal paper on
your doorstep; they are found between the
pages of telephone books and in letter-
boxes. They come through the mails
attached to advertising matter. You find
them in cafes inside your legal paper.
There is in Australia at present an
alien trouble-maker who has cause to be
thankful that it was the Australian
authorities he fell foul of and not those
of Russia or Germany. There, judging
by recent events, he could not hope to
remain alive for more than a few
days. Here, though unwanted, he is
perfectly safe. The Government desir-
ous of getting rid of him has
brought him before Court after Court;
his case has had full publicity ; a K.C.
has defended him, and, as he has won
verdicts on points of law, he is still at
large and addressing public meetings.
What a majestic advertisement for the
much-abused democratic system! Under
it Governments may be made to look
foolish, but they are never allowed to
commit crimes. Under it people who dis-
approve of their rulers, even alien in-
truders who disapprove of everything,
can speak their minds without the slight-
est danger of being grabbed by a “pro-
tective squadron” and shot in a cellar.
When Herr Kisch returns to wherever
his spiritual home may be and writes
his projected book about Australia, he
should at least proclaim that he found
the Commonwealth to be a strange land
where no citizens are executed for their
political convictions, or knocked on the
head and robbed because of their race ;
and where every important detail of
public business and administration is
open to the inspection of world.
ARGYLE ON YESTERDAYS.
Millions and percentages formed the
greater part of the policy speech of Pre-
mier Argyle (Vic.), and the audience
cheered loudly, though the chances are
that the U.A.P. majority understood the
mass of figures no better than did
the Labor minority that hooted. Per-
haps one of these days a Premier will
arise who will take the public into his
confidence. He will not devote a solid
hour to reeling off lists of huge sums of
money which not even a chartered
accountant could follow without docu-
mentary evidence, but he will state in
terms understandable by the ordinary
elector what is the actual financial posi-
tion of his State, giving only such
figures as are necessary to make himself
clear.
At times persons who were neither
cheerers nor hooters wondered whether
Dr. Argyle himself really knew the mean-
ing of the financial crossword puzzle he
placed before the people. His object, of
course, was to tell them what keen finan-
ciers the Government had been; and those
who have watched the progress of the
Argyle Government since it assumed
office are willing to credit it with having
run things in a tolerably orderly manner.
On the financial side, it has possibly
done as well as anybody could have done
—not a high compliment, but not a re-
flection.
But much of the speech was mere
guff. Take, for instance, the following
sentence, which was repeated and
elaborated in different forms many times
during the evening:
The Ministry undertakes to reduce taxa-
tion at the first available opportunity, be-
lieving that, in order not to cripple indus-
try, taxation should be as low as possible,
consistent with budgetary equilibrium.
Analysed soberly, it means nothing ; yet
it always brought applause. Another
winner was:
It is still desirable, as far as is practicable,
to keep the raising of loans within limits
which will not unduly add to the burden
created by payments for interest and sink-
ing funds.
Patting himself on the back for what
he had done for the unemployed, Dr.
Argyle stated that when he took office
there were 61,000 workless, which figure
had been reduced to 28,000. The implica-
tion is that the Argyle policy has been
responsible for effecting this reduction —
which, by the way, is strongly contra-
dicted by the Federal census. The Prime
Minister, who was on the platform, did
not dispute it; but then the Prime Minis-
ter is so new fo the company in which
he now finds himself that he has to be
careful what he says, and to decide often
that it is best to say nothing. For the
raising of the sustenance allowance the
Argyle Government is fairly entitled to
credit.
The trouble with the speech is that it
was mostly ancient history—probably as
accurate as most histories, but stale stuff.
What the Government proposed to do
if it were returned to office was only an
afterthought. The Government, it seems,
aims at gradually wiping out the dole by
a public-works policy designed to absorb
eventually all the capable unemployed ;
at establishing a scheme for the “indus-
trial repatriation” of lads of about 17
who have never worked since leaving
school; at rural rehabilitation ;at the de-
velopment of forestry ; at the prevention
of bay and river erosion ; at the erection
of new mental asylums, and at the pro-
vision of an intermediate public hospital.
All very worthy aspirations, no doubt;
but the question which arises in the mind
of the thinking elector is: “If Premier
Argyle believes in all these things, why
didn’t he carry them out? Why, at
least, didn’t he tackle them in another
session, instead of going to the country
months before there was any need?”
SIGNS OF REVOLT.
Commercial motor interests are taking a
militant interest in the Victorian general
election. Kent Hughes, the Minister of
Transport, objects to the propaganda they
are issuing, and they tartly reply that if
some of it stings the injury is nothing to
what they have suffered at his Govern-
ment’s hands. Their grievances have
been multiplied since the passing of the
Transport Regulation Bill, which the
Government has now promised to amend.
Probably these Victorians have fared no
worse than their congeners in other
States. In every mainland division the
man with the motor-lorry or motor-’bus
competing with a Government depart-
ment has been treated as Public Enemy
No. 1.
In ferocity of motor-vehicle taxes
Queensland seems to lead. It is doubt-
ful whether any other State can rival the
Queensland charges on heavy vehicles,
which work up to £lOOO a year. But
for number and arrogance of ordinances
supremacy is claimed for N. S. Wales.
“We are bogged to the axles with regu-
lations,” said one of the Sydney master-
carriers at a dinner the other night. He
reminded the Government that the
master-carriers improvised a transport
service for Sydney when the State rail-
ways and tramways went out of action
during the 1917 strike, and in these days
of militant railway unionism (the Reddest
concern is trying to form one big trans-
port union), there is quite a possibility
that they will have to do it again. Mean-
while they are spied on and penalised
and subjected to grossly unfair competi-
tion.
No one in his senses would have his
furniture shifted by railway train, to be
loaded and unloaded several times, if he
could get it done for the same price by
motor-van; but the N.S.W. Railway
Department reports that it is going into
the furniture-shifting business at a great
rate. It does not mention the financial
results, but they must be ghastly. The
admitted losses on the Government rail-
ways last year amounted to £3,388,100 ;
and the Auditor-General points out that
£13,500 realised from the sale of property
was reckoned as revenue. He coldly
records that the accumulated losses for
the 10 years to June 30, 1934, were
£26,062,200.
Just now the Governments of three
States are engaged in a characteristic
border transport wrangle at the expense
of commercial motor interests and coun-
try people, producers as well as con-
sumers —they indeed are the greatest suf-
ferers. The three Governments used to
have an agreement permitting commer-
cial motor vehicles licensed in one State
to travel some distance into the others
without paying a registration fee of £9 or
so ; but since they set up their transport
boards or commissions, and since the
High Court decided that the inter-State
freetrade clause of the Commonwealth
Constitution does not apply to vehicles
carrying goods from one State into an-
other, their sentiments have changed. So
the Melbourne Government recently
notified the others that the agreement
was at an end. It declared that they
had never observed it in a reciprocal
spirit; that, whereas Melbourne let N. S.
Wales lorries go 20 miles before pulling
them up, Sydney had a rigid 10-mile
limit, and Adelaide even classed bag-
men’s cars carrying samples as commer-
cial vehicles.
N.S.W. Railway Commissioner Harti-
gan has stressed the necessity for “main-
taining a persistent watch” in the River-
ina “to prevent traffic which undoubtedly
belongs to this State getting into the
hands of Victorian road motor services.”
The Victorian police have been instructed
to prosecute owners of N.S.W. motor-
trucks carting produce over the border
to the Victorian railways.
These crazy proceedings can’t go on.
Australians are sick of them, and sick
of being bossed by the tin gods of offi-
cialdom, who issue their commandments
in the form of regulations and add to
them constantly;
Thou shalt not ride in a motor-’bus if
there is a jerky and noisy Government tram
within a mile or so.
Thou shalt not see the country from a
service car if too poor to drive thine own.
Thou shalt instead be jolted and half-
deafened in a Government railway carriage,
perhaps infested with drunks.
Thou shalt not, if an inlander, have
necessaries brought from the city to thy
door in half the time a Government train
takes to unload them miles from it, and
with less liability to having them pinched.
Thou shalt not, if a motor-carrier, give a
wayworn fellow-creature a lift. Nor shalt
thou carry perishables to market, time being
the essence of the contract, if the tin gods
object.
Thou shalt not believe that the founders
of the Constitution had any serious purpose
when they wrote that “Trade, commerce
and intercourse among the States, whether
by means of internal carriage or ocean
navigation, shall be absolutely free.” Neither
shalt thou believe that the clause means just
what it says, and that it entitles freeborn
Australians engaged in lawful pursuits to go
from one part of the Commonwealth to
another without being held up by tin gods
or their deputies.
Australians will stand almost anything
up to a point. In this case their patience
has been strained to the limit. They will
no longer be denied the advantages of
motor transport, equitably taxed and
regulated, though a thousand tin gods
roar that they shall not have it.
CATCHING THE SHARK.
Cases in which solicitors have stolen
trust funds have been unpleasantly fre-
quent of late years in N. S. Wales. Gov-
ernment after Government has promised
to pass legislation protecting clients. Mr.
Lang had a bill drafted in 1926. Mr. Bavin
had one introduced before the debacle
of 1930. Then Mr. Andrew Lysaght
took a turn, but his effort got no further
than its first Parliamentary stages. The
robberies went on. In most instances
the public suffered; in some, the victims
were honest solicitors who had trusted
dishonest employees too niuch.
It has remained for Mr. L. O. Martin,
the present Minister of Justice, to tackle
the job thoroughly. His bill is stringent
—so stringent that it has aroused protest
from sections of the profession. It pro-
vides a series of safeguards. Proper trust
accounts must be kept. Solicitors and
solicitor-clerks must take out annual
practising certificates. Then there is to
be a fidelity-guarantee fund. Every
practising solicitor (but not solicitor-
clerk) must contribute to it not less than
£3 nor more than £lO p.a. ; it is thought
that £4 will suffice.
From this fund a person robbed by a
shyster will be permitted to claim up to
£2OOO. For the first 10 years claims in
respect of any one defaulter may not
exceed £5OOO ; after that period the maxi-
mum will be £lO,OOO. When the speci-
fied £lOO,OOO has been reached contri-
butions will cease until further tolls are
deemed necessary.
The Law Institute will be the guardian
of the fund. It will have power to con-
duct surprise audits, among other salu-
tary powers. It will be authorised also
to return all contributions to the soli-
citor retiring with an unblemished name.
Practitioners, for their part, will be re-
quired to report bad eggs like Clegg. It
has been asserted that this Clegg got away
with “hundreds of thousands of pounds.”
A grotesque exaggeration, according to
Mr. Martin ; “the amount of all proved
debts against Clegg’s bankrupt estate is
£16,953, and the proved debts include
all Clegg’s personal debts, as well as his
defalcations.” But the author of the
bill made these very frank admissions:
There was barely a solicitor in Sydney
who was not aware of the position with
regard to Clegg. Members of the profes-
sion were continually sayjng at the time,
“Look out for Clegg!” It is almost invari-
ably known among the members of the
profession when a solicitor is going astray
or playing up with a trust fund.
He added that “if this bill had been
the law at the time Clegg would have
been called to account years before he
was.” This assurance will scarcely con-
sole Clegg’s unfortunate clients, but the
new requirement will be a safeguard.
Another will be a board of discipline, to
be appointed by the Chief Justice, with
power to strike a shark instantly off the
roll and award costs against him. The
Supreme Court will retain cognate
powers. In short, the evildoer will find
himself in, constant danger of discovery,
of losing his right to practise and of
going to gaol. There is no guarantee,
however, that sentences will be stiffer
than some of those imposed in the past,
which have made the public marvel at
their mildness.
Mr. Martin has gone to Queensland
for some of the provisions of his bill.
In Queensland, as he ought to know, they
have a drastic way with defaulters. Mac-
rossan, J., prescribed 14 years for a
lawyer in a big way who had battened
on the savings of unhappy clients.


PLAIN ENGLISH.
This Changing World.
The attack on the Singapore base by
G. Ward Price, of London “Daily Mail,”
is significant. Prime Minister MacDonald
used several of Mr. Price’s arguments
(“the Empire’s most costly white ele-
phant” ; “a major blunder which Japan
regards with resentment”) as recently as
1928.
British Labor has always been hostile
to the base (again to quote Price-Mac-
Donald: “Britain, while her unemployed
stand idle, maintains 3000 coolies in
Singapore”), and if the conservative
middle-classes who support the “Daily
Mail” are losing faith there is at least a
possibility of the scheme being aban-
doned altogether. It will be remembered
that one of the first acts of the Mac-
Donald Labor Government on gaining
office in 1924 was to suspend work on
the base.
Even if Singapore is gone on with by
the Labor-Socialist Government which
is expected to succeed the MacDonald-
Baldwin Coalition, Indian rather than
Australian defence will be the justifica-
cation. However, the R.N. is not what
it was, relatively to other fleets, in 1921,
when work on the Singapore base was
started, and it may be that now, even to
save India,
no Government would send the battle
fleet to the other end of Asia, risking a
thrust at the Empire’s heart.
Australia must recognise that the de-
fence position is changing almost from
day to day. Owing to political restric-
tions on the passages of aircraft over
foreign countries the British Air Ministry
is beginning to favor seaplanes capable
of flying over all-red routes to the
Dominions. Imperial Airways is build-
ing two experimental flying-boats with a
carrying capacity of tons.
Soldiers in Australia have almost given
up thinking of strategic railways ; if the
Commonwealth is ever invaded they ex-
pect it to be defended with the help of
strategic motor roads. Our trade routes
could best be defended in war-time by
a British fleet based on Singapore. But if
Singapore goes the routes might be de-
fended by R.A.N. ships based on an Aus-
tralian port.
*
Gingering-up Defence.
There is no cause for complaint about
the appointments of a Chief of the Aus-
tralian General Staff and a new com-
mandant to replace him at the Royal
Military College. J. D. Lavarack, who
becomes head of the forces, and C. G.
N. Miles are both Australians —contem-
poraries at Brisbane Grammar School in
the days when it owned some of the best
rifle-shots in the Empire. They were
trained in the R.A.A. in its prime. Both
had senior staff experience at the war,
and returned from it lieut.-colonels at 32.
They have each had British Staff
College training, and have followed each
other through the more important cen-
tral administration jobs. They are com-
paratively young men —50 is not old,
except in the N.S.W. Government service.
H. W. Winter, G.S.O. in N. S. Wales,
succeeds Miles as Director of Military
Training.
Colonel Lavarack’s appointment is
for five years only, the Minister says,
so as to give younger officers a
chance of promotion. Salaries also will
be increased. The military head of the
forces will now receive pay “on a gradu-
ated scale up to £2OOO p.a.,” inclusive
of a maximum temporary allowance of
£6OO p.a. This is not very clear, but it
suggests that he may actually get as
much as the civilian secretary. Officers
in base commands are also promised rises.
It is to be hoped that this belated
munificence will be extended to the back-
bone of the army. “Warrant officers,
second grade,” grow old, leaving vacan-
cies worth £3Ol a year, to which “non-
commissioned officers, second grade,” on
£2Ol p.a. —the wage of an unskilled
laborer —may aspire. Head office typists
earn more on the average (£218) than
“artificers and specialists,” who average
£196.
If any private firm attempted to pay
its skilled employees on the scale on
which the more highly-trained sections
of the permanent military forces are
paid, the courts would ring with the in-
dignation of union advocates, and Par-
liament with outraged cries about
sweating.
Cancer Research.
Dr. Charles de Monchaux, just re-
turned from Europe, has emphasised the
ineffectiveness of Australian cancer-re-
search methods and treatment, having
regard to the skill and money available.
In Sydney especially there are “a diffu-
sion of skill and energy and a lack of
co-ordination” which make the work
being done “not worth a rap.”
Dr. De Monchaux holds the view that
the only way to treat cancer effectively
is in special self-contained and properly-
equipped institutions with a 'team of ex-
perts working together. The Bulletin
has said as much. Separation of the
scientific research work at the Sydney
University from treatment scattered
through half a dozen hospitals is against
modern practice. This is a matter which
might well have the attention of Mr.
Weaver (if he can weather the storm his
unruly tongue has brewed) and of Health
Ministers in other States.
Concentration is badly needed, as well
as the sending abroad regularly of
specialist investigators. In Europe and
U.S.A., treatment changes move so
rapidly that it is difficult to follow them
merely through the literature of therapy.
In U.S.A. voltages up to 1,000,000 are
in experimental use in deep-ray treat-
ment against a maximum of 600,000 in
Australia. Sweden and France are
making great strides in radium technique.
The Institute of Radiology which has
just been registered should draw up
a national plan to co-ordinate effort
in the fight against the greatest scourge
of the time.
*
Tunnecliffe’s Airy Nothings.
Vic. Labor-leader Tunnecliffe had a
strangely apathetic meeting at Colling-
wood when he brought forth his policy
speech. There were vacant seats in the
hall, and the only life was infused by
a handful of Communists, who sought
to make trouble but were not permitted.
Mr. Tunnecliffe is the member for Col-
lingwood, and Collingwood is supposed
to be a centre of militant Laborism.
Mr. Tunnecliffe simply expressed a lot
of pious aspirations. Higher wages,
shorter hours, lower interest charges,
abolition of slums, curbing of rapacious
landlords—it is the programme of any
young Labor enthusiast addressing his
debating society. “Restoration of public-
service salaries to 1929 standards” was
also mentioned. How Mr, Tunnecliffe
is going to finance these reforms was not
explained. He did refer vaguely to “the
rational use of the credit of the nation for
great national works to absorb the unem-
ployed” ; but in the most unlikely event
of a Tunnecliffe Government arriving it
would be as powerless to control “the
credit of the nation” as is the Croajinga-

Mr. Scullin spoke after Mr. Tunne-
cliffe, and praised that gentleman’s
“policy” as “practical and comprehensive
in every detail.” Victorians can only sigh
and pray for leaders worthy of the name.
They will go to the poll without enthu-
siasm and with little hope. Still, they
would do well to remember the great poli-
tical aphorism of J. F. Archibald: “If
there is not a man good enough to vote
for, there is always a man bad enough
to vote against.”

Britain Clears the Air.
The English take a strange pride in their
reputation for muddling through. They
have muddled through many financial
difficulties and diplomatic complications,
and many wars. They plan nothing ;
they are lacking in foresight; but, by
some faculty which appears miraculous,
they manage to come out safely.
There is really no miracle about the
business; it is simply that, on occasion,
supremely able men contrive to be in
power or to get the ear of those in power
and astonish the world by the country’s
achievement. Before the war the English
secret service was the laughing-stock of
every foreign Power. Before the war was
over, it was recognised even by Germany
that the English secret service stood
alone. The same with war propaganda.
Now comes another of those flashes
with which the English astonish those
who consider them stupid ; in effect, a
proposal that Britain, France, Italy, Bel-
gium and Germany shall enter into a
guarantee for mutual assistance in the
event of unprovoked aerial aggression on
the part of any one country on any other.
It puts Germany in a cleft stick. If
Germany doesn’t accept it looks for
future trouble. If it does accept it is
powerless to wreak any serious damage
on a neighbor or neighbors. There will
be set up, in effect, an international police
force with powers which the League of
Nations lacks. If Germany behaves itself
it will have as much freedom as any-
body else.
In time to come all warfare may be
air Warfare. If this pact is ratified, the
peace of Europe would appear to be
tolerably safe. The inclusion of the
U.S.A., Russia and Japan would make
the world safe, and, though there has yet
been no mention of their possible in-
clusion, it is unlikely that they have been
overlooked. England has scored again.
Another Subsidy.
There being a State election in sight, the
Queensland Government proposes to ask
its Meat Board to report on a scheme for
subsidising graziers with £1,000,000,
spread over three years, to enable them
to “bring their herds and properties up to
modern requirements for meat produc-
tion and chilled-beef export.”
No subsidy is needed, though tax-re-
duction is. Any grazier who has a decent
nucleus of stock and who has been doing
his job will have no difficulty in securing
financial assistance to develop his herd
and put his property on a payable basis.
It is a simple business proposition. If it
is sound, any bank will listen to it. If
a bank won’t, then it is not worth a
subsidy.
The amount which Mr. Forgan Smith
is to consider doling out is equal to more
than 4s. per head of all beef stock in
Queensland. As a loan it would not be
so bad if it were covered by the right
conditions. The essentials of improve-
ment are better bulls, more intensive fat-
tening, more careful handling, modern
meatworks and modern carriage.
Meatworks and ships already are being
reorganised for the chilling trade. Better
bulls can only be made universal by dras-
tically wiping out the scrub; experts
have been telling the Government this
for 30 years. A noxious bull is as big a
pest as a noxious weed, and his use should
be prohibited. Better handling can only
be secured by modernising the out-of-
date Queensland railways and letting
motor transport do its fair sharfe.

“Stiff”—for Car-owners.
In Sydney the other day a youth was
grabbed by a policeman while driving
off in a strange car. According to the
prosecution, his comment was “Gosh!
a bloke’s stiff to be caught stealing a
car.” Every habitual car-robber will
agree.
A car is the easiest of all valuables to
steal, and its parts, being mostly stand-
ardised, are the safest to deal in from
the standpoint both of thief and receiver.
So in every city in the Commonwealth
car-stealing goes on briskly day and
night. For years the Law refused to
regard it as a crime; the thief was
assumed to have borrowed the vehicle
in a spirit of harmless fun. Now it is
an offence, but a mild one.
In Glebe-road (Sydney) a few days
ago a man had luck as stiff as that of
the youth already mentioned. The owner
of a stolen car and his brother came
across it “with a stranger at the wheel
and two other men about to get in.”
According to the “D.T.”:
The man at the wheel attempted to
shake off the owner and start the car.
The owner’s brother and the two other
men joined the melee. Had not two police-
men arrived the brothers would have been
The Law proceeds normally on the
principle of the safer the crime the
severer the punishment. In the days
before science found means of identify-
ing poison in the human body, convicted
poisoners were boiled in oil. Forgers and
embezzlers receive long sentences be-
cause crimes of the sort are easy to
commit and hard to discover. A burglar
who was caught getting away with three
or four hundred pounds’ worth of pro-
perty and resisted when ordered to dis-
gorge would be lucky to get off with
seven years. The Glebe-road man got
three months —the car-thief’s usual issue.
These ridiculous sentences are caus-
ing motorists and insurance companies
heavy losses, and they are inspiring more
and more young men with an impression
that car-stealing, while a simple and
pleasant way of making easy money, is
not regarded with serious displeasure by
the Law. The practice will go on till the
punishment is fitted to the crime. Say
three years for car-robbery and five for
car-robbery with violence.

No Room for Them.
The depression has made Victorian em-
ployers of labor more exacting, and they
now demand of boys working for the
first time an elementary knowledge of
the tasks to be allotted them. This demand
has led to more youngsters resolving to
dodge dead-end jobs and to get the
knowledge required ; to that end, they
crowd the gates of the technical schools.
But the depression has caused Govern-
ments to curtail the developmental
expenditure on such schools. So when
the Victorian schools opened last week
hundreds of boys eager to learn the
rudiments of some skilled trade had to
be turned back.
In his policy speech. Premier Argyle
made no reference to the boys at the
gates. It is possible that he missed this
item of news; it appeared only 12 hours
before the delivery of the speech. If
that is so, he has the opportunity, even
now, of taking out a lifeline to the boys
who are sinking in the seas of technical
ignorance and immediately issuing in-
structions to provide accommodation
and instruction, haphazard though such
may be, for them.
He has likewise the opportunity of put-
ting himself at the head of the move-
ment, begun in his own State, to make
education a national matter. If the States
cannot train the youth of the nation the
Commonwealth can.
Bad News of the Millennium.
The seventh Russian Soviet Congress will
breed a lot of headaches. Sovietism has
been fashionable with union agitators the
world over. A scheme of things which
wipes out the bloated capitalist and
makes all men equal except the union
agitator and his bullies —they form a
privileged class —has its attractions even
for “gradualists” like those who follow
Brother Lang. But worshippers before
the Kremlin have long been suspicious
that all was not as it should be in their
temple.
Mr. Stalin, who is a trade-union secre-
tary, still has continued to dictate to the
Council of, Commissars, But capitalist
organisations have been springing up like
mushrooms. Licenses to trade for profit
were issued to shopkeepers. Delegations
of foreign capitalist writers were invited
to stay in newly-decorated hotels, com-
plete with head waiters and commission-
aires. The old blood-and-fire gang —
Zinovieff and others of his kind —were
rooted out after a final murder.
Now the Soviet Congress has adopted
reforms “embodying the best features of
the Parliamentary system.” The “secret
ballot and universal suffrage” are to be
introduced in order to “establish demo-
cracy and check bureaucracy.”
The Australian Communist Party
Training Manual gives as one of the
party’s objectives exposure of “the
fraudulent character of democratic poli-
cies.” It adds that Communists “enter
Parliament not that they may take the
machine into their own hands, but that
they may help the masses to destroy it.”
Clearly that book will have to be
rewritten.

A Cathedral in Search of a
Congregation.
N. S. Wales feeling regarding the Lang
proposal that St. Andrew’s Cathedral
should be transferred to the former Mint
site has made itself felt to an extent
anyhow. Cabinet met on Friday and de-
cided to place “an amended scheme”
before the church authorities. But any
scheme to destroy St. Andrew’s and re-
build in the Macquarie-street area will
be resented by fully 90 p.c. of the inhabi-
tants of N. S. Wales. Apart from the
gross vandalism of tearing down a beauti-
ful and historic cathedral, and apart from
the fact that the taxpayers can’t afford
the £500,000 which Mr. Lang is pledged
to pay as “compensation” if he is re-
turned to power, the scheme is fantastic.
It is on a par with the celebrated device
of burning down the house to roast the
pig—with the difference that, on this
occasion, the pig won’t be roasted.
For many years St. Andrew’s has been
neglected by those who might be expected
to frequent it. Few get married or
christened there, and the congregations
are relatively small. The Coadjutor
Bishop of Sydney (Right Rev. S. J,
Kirkby) complained last week that he
had been to a dinner “given by a man of
high commercial standing” at which he
was the only Anglican,
Where, I asked myself, could we Angli-
cans get 50 or 60 leaders in business
to come together in such an atmosphere?
The answer is in the neighborhood of
St. James’s, of St. Mark’s, Darling Point,
and of many other Anglican churches in
the suburbs and throughout the country.
There is nothing wrong with Anglican-
ism in N. S. Wales. Look at the crowds
that attend Christ Church, near the rail-
way. St. Andrew’s, however, is in the
same position as St. Paul’s, concerning
which one of London “Truth’s” ecclesias-
tical correspondents wrote last month:
It is no secret that the cathedral has not
for a -good many years played as vigorous
a part in diocesan life as does St. Saviour’s
across the water. The Mother Church in
numerous respects is not up to the level
of such cathedrals as York, Chester, Win-
chester, Exeter or Chichester.
Dr. Matthews, the new Dean of St.
Paul’s, is expected to change all this, and
the position could similarly be bettered
at St. Andrew’s. Anyhow, congregations
are not to be got by the crazy method of
bringing cathedrals to them. If Sydney
congregations can’t be attracted to a
cathedral which is on a main tram line,
and which has an underground station at
its door, then they will continue to stay
away if the building is transferred to
Bellevue Hill itself.

"AND ITS PRINTED WITH WIMBLES INKS"
“Bert the Carpenter”: The kitchen
window was smashed to pieces, and so
was a mirror on the wall. There were
three holes in the aluminium preserving-
pan and a dozen or more through the
fly-wire on the safe. Lumps of plaster
had been gouged out of the wall,
and flour and other odds and ends were
scattered over the floor. “What on earth
happened?” I asked the owner of the
house when he called me in to replace
the broken window-glass and the torn
gauze. “The wife got a craze for baking
her own bread,” he told me, “and started
a yeast bottle going. When the stuff
kept blowing the cork off she poured it
into one of those screw-top soft-drink
bottles and screwed it down tight. But
she wasn’t in the kitchen when the thing
went off, Wimmen’s luck!”
* * * *
The seats on St. Paul’s
(Melb.) Cathedral lawns have been faced
by a chain barrier —“to prevent their be-
ing used for cuddling purposes,” an aider-
man explains. Seeing that anybody
can reach them by stepping across the
chain or walking round a path, it would
argue that the quality of lovers has seri-
ously declined if a little thing like that
would stand in their way. Years ago
the doorway of the Artists’ Society’s hall
on Eastern Hill provided a dark recess
where a pair or two of philanderers could
generally be found. One day some in-
dignant Puritan entered his protest in a
letter to an editor, and within 24 hours
an iron gate was erected to terminate
such reprehensible practices.
* * * *
“Centurion”: Art and archaeological
circles in Europe are exercised over a
statue of an armed man dug up at Cape-
strano, near Naples. The figure is clad
in primitive armor with a wide-brimmed
helmet. It is rated as the oldest piece
of statuary yet discovered in Italy, and
shows marked Oriental characteristics.
To me, the most interesting part of it
is that the figure is wearing a belt sup-
porting its sword and dagger, the belt
in turn being supported by transverse
straps passing over the shoulders. In
other words, it is wearing the Sam
Browne belt which the general of that
name introduced to the British Army in
the ’nineties, and which has since been
adopted by every army with any claim to
up-to-date methods.

“M. de Paris”; Once more I am con-
strained to call the attention of Bulletin
artists to the inaccuracy almost always
displayed in drawing a headsman’s block.
Syd. Miller is the latest offender (B.
30/1/’35): he depicts the block as having
the semicircular groove for the neck run-
ning right across the top from side to
side. It is obvious that, with the neck
half buried in this groove, it would be
hard to do more than nick the spine at
most with the axe or sword. The genuine
block has only a small semicircular space
cut out of the opposite side to that on
which the victim kneels, this being to
enable the neck to lie flat on the
block. One needn’t go past Gilbert and
Sullivan to see the real article ; the block
used in “The Yeomen of the Guard” is
an exact copy of that in the Tower of
London.

“Castor”: I suggest that the reason
why so many Australians persist in wear-
ing felt hats in hot weather instead of
straw (B. 6/2/’35) is that the felt is
cooler, except, perhaps, in the case of
those freak cadies which are as full of
holes as a Gruyere cheese, and admit
rain and dust as freely as air. The boater
straw eulogised by “G. Trotter” is one
of the hottest and most uncomfortable
lids ever devised by hat-manufacturers
banking on its destructibility. The first
windy day is only too likely to see its
finish as a hat, though it may remain
useful for setting a hen in. The coolest
and lightest hats I know are bowlers
of a good make. Their only drawback
is the narrow brim.

“Jungor”: Chinamen weren’t the only
prospectors who “simply looked for sur-
face shows and never sought to develop
them” (B. 6/2/’35). On the Murchison
(W.A.) in the ’nineties I met a well-known
prospector—Westralian-born, as very few
of them were—who amazed me by men-
tioning that he had never been under-
ground. Yet he had battled down all
the way from the Kimberleys and had
“Name this child.”
“Algernon Cuthbert Montgomery.”
“Not f’r me, pop —too sissy!”
even shared in a Government reward
for discovering the Pilbara field. He’d
had his share of luck beside that; in the
end he sold a show to an optimistic Eng-
lish co. and bought a pub. When he got
down to the cellar as the holder of a
publican’s license he was probably further
from the earth’s surface than he had
ever been as a holder of a miner’s
right.
* * * *
“Whitehall”: The Sydney Art Gallery
trustees never did a better day’s work
for local culture than when they awarded
the Archibald prize to Harry Hanke. For
some reason —the strong personality of
the painter, his former poverty, a
dash of both—his success has thrilled
thousands who took no interest in pic-
tures before. On two recent Sunday
afternoons I haven’t been able to get
near his picture for several minutes. The
room containing the Archibald portraits
resembled the vestibule of a popular
movie during an interval, and the other
galleries were crowded with the over-
flow. However humiliating this may be
for the Domain orators outside it must
prove a boon to education in the long
run. A problem of every country is to
get the people to look at it's pictures. I
have walked through the gallery in
Trafalgar-square and seen nobody but
copyists, through the Louvre and seen
nobody but tourists. Relatively to popu-
lation there are probably more visitors
to the Sydney Gallery just now than
there are to any art gallery in the world.
It only remains for a local Felton to
come along and enable the trustees to
buy some really good pictures.
“Hamer”: Naturally there are reper-
cussions of such an event as the winning
of the Archibald prize by H. A. Hanke.
An artist friend who teaches when he
can get any pupils reports a brisk revival
in this branch of his business,
though it seems that parents mostly wish
to pay on the instalment plan, which
he regards as conflicting with professional
etiquette. One dad, however, was able
to settle on the nail, and his comments
were illuminating. “We didn’t think of
art until we read of this young fellow
winning this here Archibald prize,” he
explained. “ ’Smatter of fact, we were
putting the money by to have him
apprenticed to the plumbin’.”
* * * *
“Cosmos”: There can be few world-
commodities so standardised in price
as the middle-class restaurant meal. In
Soho you can get a vol-au-vent and coffee
for 25.; in the Avenue de I’Opera an
omelette and coffee for eight francs ; in
one of the squares outside the Citta Vati-
cana stuffatino and coffee for 10 lira,
and you can get any of the above dishes
in the restaurant quarters of Sydney and
Melbourne for 2s. The prices of eggs,
vegetables and meat vary permanently in
all countries, and from month to month
in most cities, but the meal charges never
change. When it is remembered that a
suit of clothes which works out at about
16 guineas here can be obtained for less
than eight guineas from a London tailor
the mystery of the static restaurant prices
becomes even deeper.
* * * *
“Ceebee”: After many futile attempts
to cope with the bicycle thief by ordinary
methods, the police in a Victorian city
set an ingenious trap. Borrowing a new
machine, they parked it unattended in
the busiest thoroughfare, taking up a
position in a car on the opposite side. A
young man presently approached, and,
after looking furtively about, mounted the
machine and tore off at a pace that would
do Opperman credit. The cops were just
starting in pursuit when the self-starter
jambed, and by the time the engine was
cranked (a few backfires adding to the
delay) their quarry was well over the
horizon. Next morning’s paper con-
tained the bald report of another stolen
bicycle.
“Coif”: A recent English shooting case
should interest this casual country, where
pretty well every citizen considers himself
justified in opposing a thief or any other
evildoer with a lethal weapon, and in-
variably gets away with it in the courts
if his aim has been a good one. In the
English instance a gamekeeper came on
some poachers. He called on them to
stand and, when they carried on, fired
his shotgun, hitting one of the fugitives
in the shoulder. This man was carrying
a bag of rabbits which he had been seen
taking out of the snares, so there was no
doubt about his guilt. Yet the Judge told
the keeper that he had no right to use
firearms because the other was caught
stealing the property the keeper was
employed to guard. The Bench added
that if the thief had been killed accused
would have been indicted on the capital
charge. As it was, he got 18 months.

“10-2-4” on his crowded profession:
There have been many plays, movies and
books stressing the resourcefulness of casta-
ways, but none, oddly enough, about the
advantages of being marooned on a desert
island with a party of Sydney journalists. There
would certainly be a doctor who tells, and
probably half a dozen. About 45 p.c. of our
doctors seem to go in for journalism as a side-
line. Among the first to land would be the
inevitable journalising clergyman; in fact, the
party would be out of luck if it didn’t acquire
a publicity-loving bishop or two. The rescued
architects would be useful for shack-building
purposes, and a few of those interior decorators
who write so prolifically for the women’s
supplements might also come in handy. That
there would be several ready writers on cooking
and home management goes without saying.
The society leaders should help to maintain the
social tone of the island, and interesting debates
might be staged between Bellevue Hill con-
tributors of articles against the cocktail habit
and fashionable supporters of latitudinarianism
as regards alcohol. Test cricketers, champion
tennis-players and scratch golfers would, of
course, be there to attend to the lighter sides
of island life; also a quota of society investi-
gators and scandal-mongers to add spice to the
proceedings. Unfortunately, on the available
figures, the odds would be against the presence
of a bona fide journalist capable of writing
a grammatical account of the castaways’ adven-
tures.

“Raymond”: 1 can certify how easy
it is to lose the accent of your own
country and acquire that of another.
The first month I was in London 1 called
at a Regent-street shop and made a
gramophone record in the form of a few
sprightly remarks to send to the old folks
at home. A year later I blew in again
and made another, for a second Christmas
offering. Reading “G. Trotter’s” par. (B.
TO/1 /’35) I put them on. The difference
is startling. One bloke defi-
nitely comes from North
Shore, where I was born;
the other is hot —or cold—
from the Regent-street pave-
ment. Yet I’ll swear I didn’t
know that my accent had
altered.

“H.A.L.”: There are more
ways than one of getting a
legal opinion. A leading
Adelaide K.C. took his seat
in a suburban train, and
almost immediately a man
opposite started an argument
with his neighbor about some
legal point. He was so dog-
matic and his ignorance
seemed so profound that the
K.C. helpfully put him
straight and told him where
he was wrong. After the
legal gent, had left, some-
body remarked: “He gave you a rare
showing-up, and it served you right.”
The shown-up person grinned, and drew
a summons from his pocket. “He’s told
me all I wanted to know,” he said.
* * * *
“Sinnik”: I notice that the French are
threatening to inflate if their tourist busi-
ness doesn’t improve. Inflation is disas-
trous in many respects, but it’s a sure way
of acquiring tourists. When the German
mark was tobogganing it was impossible
to get rooms in the best Berlin hotels,
and hard to get into a luxury shop on
account of the crowds of British and
American customers. Paris was packed
in the summer of 1926. The franc had
dropped to Id.; for the one and only
time in its history it attracted not only
the rich, but huge parties of proletarian
excursionists. Montparnasse teemed with
free-spending East-enders and Midlanders.
Now, according to the Monaco corres-
pondent of the Manchester “Guardian”:
“In Nice hundreds are starving, largely
due to the failure of English visitors to
patronise the Riviera as in the past.” In
Paris things are worse. The restaurants
are empty, wages and days of employ-
ment are being cut. The franc has been
hoisted to 3d., which, according to
Einzig (“France’s Crisis”), is “a gross
overvaluation in terms of competitive
trade.” In addition to losing its British
visitors Paris is getting no Germans (the
German Government won’t allow money
to leave the country) and few Americans.
A total loss, as compared with 1926, of
about £100,000,000 per annum.
HAUNTED.
The sun has set with splendid pomp
Beyond the mountain wall.
From out the lonely reed-fringed swamp
The plaintive curlews call.
The secret things that love the night
Come forth to rove and roam,
And swiftly through the waning light
The last lone bird flits home.
The silence deepens round my hut;
No shadow moves in sight;
But Lass, my half-bred dingo slut,
Snarls out into the night.
Down, girl! The darkness hides no foe;
No danger hovers near.
Tis but the reedbed murmuring low,
The night wind that you hear.
And yet, and yet, I somehow feel
That I am not alone;
Across the night old voices steal
From out the vast unknown.
I hear the clink of spur and rein,
The muffled tramp of steeds,
Above the night wind’s low refrain,
The murmur of the reeds.
Ah, me! These dreams of days gone by,
These longings wild and vain!
Old memories that will not die.
Old wounds that bleed again!
My mind is filled with vague regret
And fancies wild and strange;
The sunset glory lingers yet
Above yon gloomy range.
It lingers yet, and, like the beams
Around the setting sun,
A sombre glory gilds the dreams
Of days long past and done;
Those days of movement, life and zest
When baleful beacons glowed,
And splendid legions marched abreast
Down duty’s open road.

EDWARD HARRINGTON.


“Philm”: Things generally accepted as
indications of nationality are often decep-
tive. Tall and thin, slightly round-
shouldered, dressed in a black-and-white-
checked suit that was obviously English,
and carrying a walking-stick, he looked
to me to have stepped right out of a
Wodehouse novel. “Ai see in this morn-
in’s papah that you have some faine
values in men’s panamah hats,” he
drawled. Having made his choice, he
asked for his old hat to be delivered.
“The Strathnaver?” I asked—it was mail-
boat day. The customer stared at me.
“Strathnaver? What are you talking
about, mai good man? Here’s the
address on mai card.” He was the man-
ager of a local window-cleaning estab-
lishment !

“Verri”: The least obtrusive ways of
carrying money are the safest. A draper
in a M.L. town used to bear home his
takings on Saturday night; with him
went his wife and daughter, who helped
in the business. The ladies carried
homely string kits, the draper a Glad-
stone bag. One night the expected hap-
pened. Naturally it was the Gladstone
bag that the thief snatched and fled with.
The papers next day mentioned the loss
of the bag, and stated the amount of
the takings, but only the family and the
police were aware that the money was
“Fix that suspender, George—you look positively naked!”
safe, having been stowed in one of the
string kits. The bag was found discarded
in a back lane, and nothing more was
heard of the matter until a postcard
reached the draper. The writer remarked
bitterly that he had a good mind to tell
the police that there was nothing but
rubbish in the bag, and stigmatised its
erstwhile owner as an unscrupulous liar.

“S.T.S.”: A most successful salvage
work is the gutting of the motor-ship
Victoria, stranded on October 5 a few
miles east from Cape Jervis lighthouse,
S.A. Captain Arnold, appointed salvage
contractor at 70, has established a camp
of 25 men on the beach, and dragged
or flying-foxed ashore three anchors, two
five-ton shafts and heaps of valuable
machinery, which bursting oiltanks kept
in surprisingly good condition after the
wreck. The ultimate problem will be
to get all this weighty stuff to a market,
the lonely beach being 20 miles from
anywhere, and at the foot of a cliff road
with a grade of 1 in 4 —or worse.
* * * *
“Hamer”: A speaker at the Royal
Life-Saving Society’s meeting, discussing
the asserting and establishing of the Syd-
ney public’s right to surf-bathing at any
hour of the day, gave all the credit to
the late W. H. Gocher; but Gocher’s
defiance of the law was only the culmina-
tion of a long agitation. There was a
Bondi Surf Club years before that. The
members used to clamber out of the baths
and bathe —in Vs —amongst the rocks and
on the edge of the beach. Whenever an
offender was caught by the solitary patrol
policeman he was convicted and fined.
But every fine produced an agonised
burst of newspaper agitation ; and that
helped when Gocher put the matter to
the test. Little Coogee (now Clovelly)
Bay was a recognised open bathing spot
over 40 years ago —and there was mixed
bathing there, too.
* * * *
“Centurion”: The alleged discovery
by two Melbourne professors that a
swagman can carry as big a weight as
an infantryman with less exertion (B.
6/3/’25) doesn’t prove that military ex-
perts are mugs who are always being
put right by civilians. I know Syd-
ney wheat-lumpers who could carry both
swagman and infantryman, loads and
all, but that doesn’t make the lumper’s
method of humping a bag of wheat
ideal for everyone. It is true that
recruits are instructed to place the ball
of the foot on the ground before the heel.
You won’t find that done outside the Im-
perial service, and even there it is only
used in teaching the ceremonial slow
march, such as we saw the Grenadiers
Band doing in Sydney. Route march-
ing, with its short, brisk step, is pure
heel-and-toe. Further, as one whose
experience of drill goes back quite a
long way, I can vouch that soldiers were
not compelled in the old days to “march
with stiff arms, little finger on the seam
of the trousers.” That detail was part
of the instruction for standing at atten-
tion, and the little finger had not to be
“on” but “in a line with” the seam.
* * * *
“Lex”; The futility of peace move-
ments was interestingly stressed in the
latest legal joust, the contempt action
against the “S. M. Herald” by Herr
Kisch—a doughty and persistent Court
battler who is supposed to be here in
the interests of pacifism. Last month the
High Court said that Scottish Gaelic
“could not be regarded as a European
language within the scope and intention
of the Immigration Act.” Gaelic, said
the Court, had been diminishing in Scot-
land for 40 years (Scottish census figures
given). At the last census in 1931 it
was spoken by only 2.97 of the inhabi-
tants ; English was the language of Scot-
land. Boiling with patriotic rage (per-
haps the most furious and bull-headed Of
all classes of rage) a number of Scots,
including a clergyman, bombarded the
“S. M. Herald” with letters and articles
containing statements which, as the
paper’s apology to the High Court put
it, were at times “inaccurate, intemperate
and offensive.” The writers were not
against the High Court per se; the sole
trouble was that it had offended their
nationalistic pride. Nationalism is pro-
verbially stronger than internationalism.
The Gaels’ contributions to the “S. M.
“Energetic bloke, ain’t he? He’s done all that since lunch-time.”
Herald” show that nationalism is also far,
far stronger than sense. And it is lack
of sense (50 p.c.) and bad temper (50
p.c.) that lead to most wars.
* * * *
“Ex-Englishman”: Surely of all cur-
rent crazes sunbaking is the silliest. For
Australia, that is. In England, where it
started, well-to-do people came back
from the sea or the Riviera with a fine tan,
so that enormous section, mostly women,
who buy the sixpenny papers and imi-
tate “society” manners strove to look
the same, basking in such little sunshine
as came their way, and buying a brown
skin lotion to do the rest. Pathetic, per-
haps, but understandable. And then our
young fools must imitate them, import-
ing the trick to a land where sunshine
is the birthright of everyone, and where
the only difficulty is not to get sunburnt.
* * *
“Spring”: Arresting, but not surprising,
to hear that the Prince of Wales has com-
posed an air for the bagpipes and has
presented the score to the Scots Guards.
There is a strain of music in the family ;
the Prince’s great-uncle, the Duke of Edin-
burgh, played the fiddle, and his great-
grandfather, Prince Albert, composed
numerous “pieces” for the piano and
organ, choral services being a specialty,
as the advertisements say. Note also
the perspicuity of the Prince in present-
ing his composition to the Scots Guards,
men hardened to that sort of thing, and
not to his own regiment of the Welsh
Guards, drawn from a nation which puts
the harp before the pipes,
* * * ♦
“Kayeff”: Nobody has touched on the
very worst defect of the kilt as a mili-
tary garment —its vulnerability to the
irritant gases of modern warfare. Sta-
tioned on a shell dump behind Nieuport,
on the Belgian coast, I saw what gas
could do to kilted troops. A Highland
regiment was holding the line in
strength, in preparation for the push that
was to cut off the submarine bases
further up the coast, when Fritz
drenched the sector with mustard
gas. It was a still, windless night,
entirely suitable for the pur-
pose. Brought out of the line, the
Jocks were sent back near us as reserves,
after apparently recovering somewhat
from the first whiffs of the gas. But the
delayed-action effect of the stuff was
manifested next day. Every inch of bare
skin showed the raw, blistering appear-
ance which later was to become so
familiar. For days the place was clut-
tered up with blinded, raw-skinned Scot-
ties gasping in agony, while worried
medical men tried ineffective remedies.
* * H= *
There was a reunion in Mel-
bourne the other night of surviving mem-
bers of the old “Rose of Denmark Life-
boat Crew,” a fife-and-drum band started
by Sam Mauger about 60 years ago.
For close on half a century these
musicians toured Victoria with a lifeboat
mounted on wheels and drawn by a team
of horses. Although the name and the
pageantry bore a strong nautical flavor,
the Rose of Denmark wasn’t a ship ; it
was a Rechabite lodge at Fitzroy. The
name has been adopted by a lot of
friendly societies. I suppose it was origi-
nally taken in honor of the bride of the
Prince of Wales who afterwards became
King Edward VII.
* * * *
“Niet Verstaan”: “Keg’s” sneer at the
S’African Scottish (B. 30/1/’35) is unde-
served. The kilted Capetown regimeni.
known for many years as the Duke of
Edinburgh’s Own, did good service in
Kaffir wars, as well as in the first Boer
trouble, when it relieved British troops
sent from Capetown to Natal. In the
second Boer War its duties were mostly
confined to guarding railway bridges in
Cape Colony, and it stuck that ghastly job
for the duration, relieving regular troops.
It had a good reputation generally in
South Africa, though the same cannot be
said of another kilted regiment which was
raised in Johannesburg after the for-
mation of the Union. The opportunity
was too good to be missed by the press
humorists, who gave the new regiment
a bad time while it lasted, among the
mildest of the allegations being that ail
commands and regimental orders had to
be issued in Yiddish.
# ♦ * *
“Minor Bar”: Add to the anti-climaxes
of Judges (B. 30/1 / ’35) a sentence
attributed to Justice Grantham in the
Memoirs of Montague Williams—Gran-
tham was noted for his ponderosity and
lack of humor. The convicted man was
a butler who had been selling his master’s
wine, and his ludship’s peroration ran:
“Yet, lost to all sense of decency and
shame, you have for years been feather-
ing your nest with your master’s bottles.”
* * * *
“Hoofer”: Sydney and Melbourne
traffic heads intent on regulating pedes-
trians might take a tip from Sweden.
Tired of police warnings, marked road-
ways and other futile methods, the
Swedes decided to put pedestrian “man-
nequins” on the streets. These model
pedestrians, distinguished by a badge,
walk about all day and impress the public
with the perfect way in which they cross
the streets and keep to the proper side of
the pavements. Great results are ex-
pected when the next batch of accident
statistics come up for review.
* * * *
“Waltonian”: Walter Kingsmill did
good work in fields—or, rather, water-
ways—left untouched by the average poli-
tician. Always a keen naturalist, he was
the first man to see the possibilities of the
European freshwater perch as a de-
sirable immigrant to the poorly-stocked
waters of South Westralia, The fish,
along with two or three other varieties,
were introduced through his efforts many
years ago. They throve wonderfully in
their new surroundings, attaining a size
which would amaze English anglers, and
already they are constituting a real
attraction in the rivers and brooks, and
even in some of the semi-brackish lakes
around Katanning and other centres.
The other day a party of anglers landed
over 200 of the prickly-backed fish, aver-
ing nearly lib. apiece—they have been
taken up to 51b. The perch is a game fish
that gives good sport and furnishes better
eating than any other of the so-called
“coarse fish” of English waters.
SPOONERS.
“The new beach costumes must have legs at least
three inches long.”
I find it somewhat difficult to follow
These new intricacies of dress design
Gazetted for Diana and Apollo
(And you and me) when sporting in the brine.
But this needs no explanatory captions,
It’s plain and pointed as a pitchfork prong:
The legs of Spooner’s much-discussed contrap-
tions
Have got to be at least three inches long.
You couldn’t number him among the wowsers
Whose sense of decency it jars and hurts
To see a Latin god devoid of trousers,
A Grecian goddess destitute of skirts.
He’s read, unmoved, of Satyrs and Bacchantes
Ranging the woods unclad, in Keats’s song;
Withal he stipulates that surfing panties
Must be equipped with legs three inches long.
He doesn’t hold all old conventions brittle,
Or yet unbreakable. He wouldn’t screen
The human form too much, nor yet too little.
His preference is for the golden mean.
’Twixt mid-Victorian views he compromises
And propaganda of the nudist throng
Who, deftly dodging both extremes, devises
A beach costume with legs three inches long.
Yon careless sheiks, and naiads ultra-daring
Into the latest novelties who climb,
I warn you to be watchful what you’re wearing
Into the foam-flecked waves next summer-
time.
Your sense of comme il faut will find impugners
To rule you out and put you in the wrong
Unless the nether section of your Spooners
Shows leg-containers full three inches long.

POLITICAL POINTS
The umpteenth Labor unity confer-
ence at Sydney produced the customary
explosive language and “heated scenes. ’
On the third day, according to the
“Labor Daily,” Dwyer-Gray, an elderly
gentleman from Dublin, who is now Tas.
Labor Treasurer, had a dispute with
Kenneally, Westralia’s “full-time Minis-
ter for Employment,” who said “Go and
be damned and do it!” The delegates
presently dispersed, but the full-time
Minister and three other gentlemen re-
mained in Sydney to tell the factions that
they would make some recommendation
or other to the Federal executive if
everybody promised to be good.
Forced to drop its grandiose plan for
unifying the railway gauges, the Lyons
Government may have to abandon the
Port Augusta-Red Hill project. Someone
has told Lyons that it would return a
profit of “nearly £6OOO a year.” South
Australia has better reason for believing
that it would increase the huge losses on
its own railways. Though permissive
legislation was passed some years ago, the
Adelaide Government thinks it still has
a right of veto, and is in the mood to
exercise it.
Another Churchill has made a spec-
tacular first appearance on the political
stage. It was not successful, but the
aspiring youth, standing for Wavertree —
ordinarily one of the safest Conservative
seats in the U.K. —took enough votes
from the “official” candidate to let a
Labor man in. He is a grandson and
namesake of Randolph Churchill, who
“forgot Goschen,” and a son of Winston
Churchill, who forgot the Crimea.
There has been a decided slump in
support for London loans. The under-
writers were left with 39 p.c. of the
£22,384,000 of Commonwealth 2>\ per
cents. ; and with £1,800,000 of £10,000,000
asked for by the London County Coun-
cil. Worse still, the public subscribed
only 3 p.c. of a Lancashire loan. If the
situation does not improve, there will be
small chance of floating another big con-
version loan this year ; and it was pro-
posed to ask for £48,712,700, chiefly on
behalf of N, S. Wales.
Having established the impression that
it is an easy mark, the Government at
Canberra is being bombarded with re-
quests for grants. One hopeful band has
asked it for £5OOO to send a lot of life-
savers overseas ; another wants £lO,OOO
for “Empire Games.” A third group
“demands” £35,000 p.a. for a doubtfully
second-rate opera co. It used to be
thought that a Government’s function
was to govern and not play fairy god-
mother to everybody.
The goldminers’ strike has been a fear-
ful embarrassment to Westralian Labor.
Unwilling to offend either side, the Gov-
ernment marked tirhe for a month; mean-
while all the mines were idle, and indus-
trial arbitration —the men struck against
an award of the Court, as did Fremantle
lumpers and Collie coalies —was reduced
to a mockery. Then the inept Adminis-
tration began talking vaguely about
frightful things that might happen to the
companies if they didn’t abandon their
legal rights. Now it has “persuaded” the
strikers to go back for six weeks and
then take a ballot.
Prof. Harrison Moore suggests what
persons less learned have said in blunter
language —that too many lawyers had a
hand in the making of the Common-
wealth Constitution. They were “emi-
nent lawyers,” as he says, and they
“knew all there was to be known about
the U.S.A. and Canadian Constitutions.”
It might have been better had they not
made such an exacting study of those Con-
stitutions, but had made an exact study of
Australian conditions.
It would have been better still had they
waited another 10 years and gone in
for a system that would work.
In spite of severe pay-cuts and taxa-
tion, Victoria had a deficit of £900,000 last
year. Tunnecliffe nevertheless undertakes,
if entrusted with the care of the rocky
finances, to “restore public-service
salaries to 1929 standards” and give “full-
time employment at award wages to all
citizens who are willing to work.” He
promises, in addition,
“Pensions for widows”; “restoration
of wages” and “reduction of hours” (to
40 a week); “free school requisites”;
“£lOO,OOO a year for mining”; 25 p.c. off
railway freight-rates on farm produce;
“exemption from land tax of all land used
solely for agricultural, horticultural, dairy-
ing and grazing purposes” ; “unemployment
insurance” and “readjustment of liabilities
on a 2 p.c. basis for home-purchasers and
rural producers.”
Tunnecliffe obviously believes in fairies.
“Fellow-electors of Victoria, say you believe in fairies, and
save us all!”
To Scullin Tunnecliffe’s “policy” is
“practical and comprehensive in every
detail” ; but no doubt Jimmy feels that
he has to say things like that. He was
happier in a reference to Premier Argyle
as the champion of the Go-slow Move-
ment, who in the last session of Parlia-
ment achieved a whole 39 sittings. Argyle
recently flew a kite for five-year Parlia-
ments on the ground that it was impos-
sible to do the work in three years.
There has been an annoying check to
the Lang plan for getting R.C. votes by
promising subsidies to church schools.
Clumsy fellows in the Sydney Labor
Council have committed themselves to
the support of birth-control clinics. They
can scarcely be repudiated, for they
saved Lang when he was in danger of
being deposed by Loughlin, but neither
can the protests of R.C. unionists be
ignored.
An unspeakable ruffian who shot a
Queensland farmer in the spine and then
tried to outrage his wife has been sen-
tenced at Rockhampton to seven years’
hard labor. His counsel asked that he
should be kept under observation.
“Observation won’t help him,” said Bren-
nan, J., drily ; “it is sterilising he needs.”
If the beast lived in Germany he would
get it. That country refuses to let its
criminals, lunatics and imbeciles breed
other criminals, lunatics and imbeciles,
and had 180,000 of all sorts sterilised
last year.
One of Moore’s commonsense reforms
was the abolition of four saints’ days as
paid public holidays. It has been an ad-
vantage to Queensland, and it has not
prevented the minorities concerned from
observing the holiday at their own ex-
pense ; but one important section persists
in regarding abolition as a grievance.
Labor has hitherto been unsympathetic
while professing sympathy. Now Forgan
Smith has promised that if condeetions
improve the Act will be amended after
the elections, ye ken.
Men of all parties regret the death of
Martin Flannery, who, as Lang’s news-
paper says, “served the electors for 12
years with unswerving zeal and integ-
rity.” „ .
With his death Labor loses one of its
staunchest supporters... .who never be-
trayed a trust and in whom loyalty was a
paramount virtue. He was held in the
highest esteem by all, both inside and
outside of the Labor movement.
Then why was poor Flannery ejected
from the Lang Ministry in 1925 and
excluded from the Lang Ministry in
1930?
One healthy sign of the times is that
Government by regulation is encounter-
ing increased resistance. A Transport
Department regu-
lation prohibiting
parking in Sydney
streets for an hour
in the morning and
evening—B.ls to
9.15 and 5.15 to
6.15 —was chal-
lenged in the N. S.
Wales Assembly
the other day.
Minister Bruxner
pleaded that it was
designed to prevent
accidents, but 10
Ministerialists were
dissatisfied with
this explanation,
though the chal-
lengers were beaten
by six votes. It is
to be hoped that
this spirit of resist-
ance to bureau-
cratic control will
grow.
Lang has been
going about saying
that the rolls are
stuffed and virtu-
ously announcing
his determination to purify them.
Stevens threatens to make him prove
his aspersions, if he can. Mean-
while, the only positive eyidence of hanky-
panky work comes from the Sydney
Lang-Labor municipality of Waterloo.
As a result of allegations that it went
on wholesale at the late municipal elec-
tions, the Town Clerk has presented a
report to the effect that there were 17
proved cases of “duplication.”
Lang to his Newcastle followers, or
what remains of them:
Vicious attacks are made on me, not
because I am Lang, but because I am
a Labor man. But the things said against
me are not so bad as the things said about
Hughes, Watson, Holman and Fisher in
their day.
Oh, yes, they are! No one ever said of
Hughes that he smashed a Savings Bank,
or of Holman that he defaulted to the
British and paid the Americans, or of
Fisher that he “scaled” the Common-
wealth Bank, or of Watson that he
brought in a 10 p.c. tax on mortgages
with exemption for a £13,000 mortgage
debenture of his own.
According to Customs Minister White,
the nation-wide campaign against his
grandmotherly book-censorship is not
worrying him a bit. He asserts that the
censorship is directed almost wholly at
the pornographic, and that no political
matter is banned unless it directly incites
to revolution or violence. The same Mel-
bourne paper which chronicles his state-
ment contains a list of books already on
the index ; among them are numbers of
political works which evidently Mr.
White has never read. His departmental
advisers would have difficulty in find-
ing, in many of them, one word which
incites to revolution or violence.
Leigh Scott', librarian of Melb. Uni-
versity, is hitting hard at the censor-
ship. The university, he says, is put in
the ridiculous position of having to
refuse to supply prescribed books to
students or of disobeying the censorship
—books obtained from London on the
recommendation of English universities!
It is well for some politicians that
Parkhill is himself one of their number.
Dillon, who represents Essendon (Vic.)
for the U.A.P. and is to stand for re-elec-
tion, confessed at a meeting that during
the last Parliament he had voted
against the Government 14 times. Were
Parkhill Grand Panjandrum of the
organisation, Dillon’s head would have
been on a charger long ere this.
Dissecting the accounts of N.S.W.
Government railways, Auditor-General
Spence objects, very properly, to the pro-
ceeds of the sale of property in Phillip-
street, Sydney (£13,580), being credited
to “revenue under the head of ‘Rents and
Miscellaneous,’ ” instead of going
towards the reduction of the railway
debt, and questions the “profit” of £5331
claimed on the refreshment-room. He
drily deducts £5254 for interest and ex-
change, and says, in effect, that far too
little was allowed for depreciation —£460
compared with £4355 in 1930;
These figures indicate the absence of the
application of any proper accounting prin-
ciple to the determination of the annual
charge.
This is rough on Commissioner Harti-
gan, who is an accountant himself.
Says Dr. Hilda Kincaid, who is in
charge of child-welfare work in Mel-
bourne :
Among children of school age there is
much malnutrition. Between the ages of
two and six 1233 children were examined,
and of these 26.4 per cent, were under-
nourished.
Dr. Kincaid added that this was not due
wholly to poverty or underfeeding, or
even to wrong feeding. Lack of rest,
diseases of throat and nose and unfavor-
able mental environment were big con-
tributing factors. But proper rest, ade-
quate treatment of throat and nose dis-
eases and favorable mental environment
are scarcely to be expected in the home
of the dole-winner.
Since the Versailles Treaty was signed
there have, it is said, been 210 inter-
national agreements renouncing war as
an instrument of policy. Ramsay Mac-
Donald has been concerned in most of
them. The unwearied old pacifist signed
another last week in conjunction with
Flandin, recently struck off the narrow-
ing list of Frenchmen who have not been
Prime Minister of France. The familiar
assurances are given that peace is now
assured, but Germany, Russia, Japan and
the U.S.A. have reserved judgment.
By common consent of the other
students of political science, one of the
wisest and wittiest contributions to the
Healesville (Vic.) symposium was that of
J. A. McCallum, from Sydney. Mc-
Callum’s accounts of the U.A.P. (“that
chequered and speckled piece of cabinet-
making in which it is not possible to dis-
cover any integrating principle”), of com-
pulsory voting (“it brings the apathetic,
the parasitic and the venial to the poll”)
and of Labor (“the one enduring and
real movement in Australian political
life, but hampered when in office by a
constantly recurring inclination to com-
mit suicide”) made all his fellow-scholars
laugh. Yet this able Federal Laborite —
a Digger withal —has had fearful lickings
as a candidate. He lost his deposit in
Federal Lang last year.

PERSONAL
ITEMS
Melbourne University has chosen a
Vice-Chancellor in R. E. Priestley who,
if not an Australian, at least knows some-
thing of this country by personal experi-
ence. He was born in England and he
went to school there, but he came to
Sydney University to work under David
nearly 30 years ago. He left to join
the Scott Expedition, and he had a bril-
liant career afterwards as a geologist at
Cambridge. He served with the British
signallers in the war (M.C.), and wrote
the official history of his arm of the
service afterwards.
Hampton Court, at King’s Cross, is
probably Sydney’s best-known block of
flats. A. G. Hampton, the man the
building was called after, and one of the
biggest shareholders in the company that
owns it, died in his flat there on Satur-
day. Hampton was only 65, yet he was
one of the first men to own a car in
Sydney, and a pioneer of the industry ;
he helped to found the R.A.C. ; and he
prophesied the lines on which Darling-
hurst was going to develop quarter of a
century ago, when a tree-shaded cottage
stood on the present site of the local
picture palace.
“Adelaide S.”: Add to “Norbell’s”
remarks (B. 6/2/’35) that Walter Cor-
nock was a great comedian as well as
an inveterate gagger. He began as call-
boy to Johnny Sheridan, played Sheridan
parts in Brisbane, and at Sydney Grand
Opera House had the distinction of being
Australia’s youngest dame. Cornock
was loved for his kindly ways by hun-
dreds of stage kiddies and supers, who
came under his stage managership at
the old King’s Theatre in Brisbane. An
appropriate epitaph would be: “He
never gagged or took a scene at the ex-
pense of a nervous newcomer.”
“Jeames”: Admiral Patey, who com-
manded the R.A.N. when practically all
the ranks and a good many of the ratings
were British, was a typical R.N. officer.
His father was a naval captain ; he him-
self was born in Plymouth (like South-
sea and Portsmouth, a haven of naval
families) and he died there last week. He
was invested with the K.C.V.O. on the
Australia by the King in 1913, and his
flag was flying on the battle-cruiser in
Sydney in August, 1914. Most of his war
service, however, was performed in the
North Sea with the R.N. and on North
American and West Indian stations. A
cheery little man who loved sport and
society and who was immensely popular
in the clubs of all the capitals, he repre-
sented the end of a naval era in Australia.
The navy has never been “social” since
his departure.
“M.G.”: The late E. George Marks
was described by John Norton as “the
man who rescued Napoleon from obli-
vion.” His devotion to the memory of
the Emperor under whom his forebears
served was matched by only one other
Marks fanaticism. Business, Money didn’t
interest him as such —he was generous
to a fault —but he had a fine financial
brain, and he pulled off many a profit-
able deal outside journalism. Once when
he cleverly beat a crook who had tried
to take him down in a business deal a
fellow-pressman murmured enviously:
“And George claims to be a Catholic!”
Another one about E. George Marks;
After Napoleon George’s chief idol was
Bradman. The bodyline business of 1933
caused some of Don’s staunchest supporters
to drop their bundles; George refused to so
much as lower his. Came a time when the
betting was fairly high against Don making any
kind of a score. George used to back him
to make 50 or over. The first Test was a
financial blow; the second a disaster. Still
George persevered, confident that the 20’s and
30 s which the Master had been making were
but trials of his disciples’ faith. He fairly piled
the cash on for the third Test, and found plenty
of takers. On this occasion, of course, Bradman
came off. Such was George’s ecstasy that he
almost forgot to collect his winnings—almost
but not quite. Rarely on a human face have
I seen such an expression of bliss as that which
irradiated the surrounding atmosphere as George
received the reward of his great trust.

This is Colonel “Joe” Lavarack,
who will take over from Major-General
Bruche as Chief-of-Staff next April,
Lavarack’s father was a draftsman in
the Queensland Survey Department, and
a major in the Queensland Artillery in
his spare time. Young Lavarack got
his first military experience with the
Brisbane Grammar School cadets ; he
joined the R.A.A. before he was
20. He was an R.A.A. captain when
he earned the right to add p.s.c. to his
name at Camberley in 1914, and
Australia’s new Chief-of-Staff.
.■ , ,
m September of that year he became
a captain m the Bntish army. He trans-
f“ re f r ° d'™ £ “ Chrisda”s

with the R.M.C. goes back to 1920, when
he became Director of Military Art
under Legge.

E. V. Timms, whose list of published
novels runs into double figures, has been
admitted to membership of the Institut
Litteraire et Artistique de France. He
is the only Australian who has so far
gained this honor. “Conflict” earned it
for him.
“Jeames”: Sir Eric Drummond, the
British Ambassador to the Vatican, who
heard the decrees in connection with the
canonisation of More and Fisher read
last Sunday at St. Peter’s, is destined to
make one of Britain’s oldest earldoms
Catholic. He is heir-presumptive to the
Earl of Perth. There are representatives
of this enormous Scottish family in the
U.S.A., in every part of the British
Empire, and in almost all walks of life.
Drummonds are said to have served in
every capacity, from brigadier down-
ward, in the front line during the war,
and they won every decoration between
them, from the V.C. (won by a naval
Drummond) downward. Sir Eric Drum-
mond, like Australia’s Scottish visitor,
Lord Sempill, became a Catholic after
his marriage. His wife’s father was Lord
Herries, and her only sister is the
Duchess of Norfolk —and, incidentally.
Baroness Herries in her own right. This
fifteenth-century Scottish barony de-
scends in the female line in default of a
male heir.
“1-8-7”; Paddy Henry, aged 81, claims
to be the oldest working bullocky on
earth. Born in Glasgow, he arrived in
the Terang (Vic.) district in 1871, and he
has been propelling bullocks ever since.
Last week he pointed out his bullocks
grazing on a strawberry clover flat, and
offered to give me a pound for every
mark of the whip I could find on the 11
broken-in by himself. Number 12, which
he barred, was broken-in by an inexperi-
enced youngster in his early sixties.
“Pilot’s” reminiscences;
The late Superintendent Hector McLean had
charge of the police operations against Butler,
the “Mountains Murderer,” who advertised for
partners in a Glenbrook prospecting venture,
induced them to dig their own graves and then
killed and buried them. Butler got away to
America, and McLean sent Detective Roche
for him. Roche was accused by the ultra-
righteous of having allowed Butler to remain
in a state of alcoholic oblivion for most of
the ’Frisco-Sydney trip. Questioned by Mc-
Lean, Roche admitted the impeachment, but
claimed that if he hadn’t allowed his formidable
prisoner to get speechless now and then he
would never have got him back alive. The
late David McKee Wright, who lived at Glen-
brook, took me one day to see Butler’s
“grave.” It was still a tourist attraction after
30 years.
“Ath.”; V. R. S. Meredith, who will
manage this year’s All-Black Rugby team
in England (B. 6/2/’35), secured the
conviction of William Alfred Bayly
in the biggest murder trial in the history
of M.L. Bayly, a Ruawaro settler, mur-
dered his neighbors, Mr. and Mrs. Lakey.
It took 52 police to sheet home the crime,
and H. J. Wilson, a member of the
Auckland “Star” staff, wrote a 300-page
book on the subject. Bayly is probably
the only murderer in the Empire who
has been cremated after being executed.
Lily Beaurepaire, once an Austra-
lian Olympic representative, got into
the news again last week owing to a
vain endeavor to save a drowning man at
Lome (Vic.). As a child in Albert Park,
she specialised in dragging other young-
sters from watery graves, and she has
been at it ever since. On her first visit
to Sydney as member of a Victorian
swimming team, her first view of the
harbor synchronised with a ferry pas-
senger’s accidental plunge from a Circu-
lar Quay wharf. She duly hauled him
out. Lily is a sister of Frank, also a
former champion and now a Melbourne
businessman and a City Councillor.


GOODYEM Ui,ih
Goodyear decided long ago that a product
with low price alone to recommend it was
not worth making.
So Goodyear has developed to-day's
Pathfinder actually a low priced tyre,
but such a genuine, through-and-through
Goodyear product that its low price is the
last thing you are asked to look at.
On the straight out basis of Mileage, there
is no tyre in its price class to challenge
to-day's Pathfinder, for Goodyear has built
the Pathfinder body of famous Supertwist
Cord giving longer carcass life, combined
with a tough, sturdy, wear-resisting tread.
These are the things you are offered in
to-day's Pathfinder the low price merely
adds to the economy. Ask your Goodyear
Dealer for the price on your size. Avail-
able in all popular sizes for cars and trucks.

To the Man who is 35
and Dissatisfied.
WE deliberately pass over a large proportion of readers
to address this advertisement directly to men in their
thirties. There is a powerful reason for this. From 30
to 35 is the age of crisis. In these years a man either
marks out the course that leads to definite advancement
or settles to channels from which it is difficult to move.
To the man who is looking to the future the Institute
offefls a commonsense way of speeding up his progress.
A new book, called “What A Business Man Must Know To-
day,” will tell you all you require. Cut out this advertise-
ment and send it with your name and address for a free copy.

There is £358,111 of capital in 40,000
first, 108,111 second and 60,000 third
prefs. and 150,000 ords. The prefs. are
all 8 p.c. cumulative, and advance with
the ords. beyond that rate, or beyond
6.2 p.c. while the N. S. Wales Interest
Reduction Act remains in force. At
September 30 the lot, together with re-
serves and £lOl coming to creditors, was
represented by shares in Australian
Paper Manufacturers (in at £358,111)
and £20,346 of debtors’ balances, etc.
The manufacturing co. took over the
Cumberland’s and Australasian Paper
and Pulp’s assets for scrip in 1926. Later
it struck 4s. per share (£320,000) off its
capital, reducing the figure to £1,280,000.
No allowance has been made for this in
Cumberland’s books.
The market prices all the shares around
345., the yield being 4.7 p.c. on an 8 p.c.
div. basis. The net tangible cover is
£7 17s. 4d. firsts, £2 10s. 9d. seconds,
£2 15s. 6d. thirds and 14s. 2d. ords. To
enable this holding co. to distribute 10
p.c., the manufacturing co. would need
pay a shade over 12i p.c. on its capital.

Exchange and the tariff have brought
much business formerly placed overseas
this co.’s way. The extra turnover and
improved manufacturing methods have
enabled it to reduce costs and selling
prices and earn more profit. The im-
provement of £18,342 in last year’s figure
was due mainly to a reduction of £17,500
in the provision for taxation (£32,500).
The allowance for depreciation was
£2900 heavier at £69,400, making the
total so reserved £453,442. The final
div, was not disclosed in the published
accounts ; appearances are that it was the
same as in 1933.

After adding £52,456 net to the book

In conjunction with Tasmanian Paper
Pty., the co. has engaged an English ex-
pert to decide the question of making
printing and writing papers from Tas-
manian hardwoods. It is also consider-
ing the erection of a pulp mill (kraft) in
S. Aus., where thinnings from the State
pine forests are available, and is weigh-
ing the possibilities of an option from
the Government over a large timber area
(eucalyptus) at Eden (N.S.W.). The idea
is to further reduce costs and make the
co. independent of imported pulp.

This 60-year-old Dunedin-controlled fire
and marine office is a solid concern.
Early in its career it singed its fingers in
a scramble to write American and Rus-
sian business; but it soon abandoned
foreign fields, and has since confined acti-
vities to Maoriland and Australia. Over
the last 30 years divs. have averaged 13i
p.c., sweetened with £150,000 (= 12s. 6d.
per share) of bonus scrip, issued since
1919, making the 200,000 £5 shares paid
to 20s. each. For more than a decade
returns from investments have exceeded
or kept close up to the mounting divi-
dend charge (last year’s £22,261 of net
interest was 11.1 p.c. on capital), thanks
to the fine pile of reserves, heaped over
twice as high as paid capital when the
books last closed.

Slump evaporated a lot of insurable
value and bumped up the loss rate, as
it did in the ’nineties. Still, the recent
extraordinary drop in the loss rate has
turned the tables. It is due largely to a
more rigid selection of risks, which also
partly accounts for the continued fall in
net premiums. Last year’s underwriting
surplus was £20,412, up £3070, making
the net return from all sources (after
allowing for reserve adjustments) 20.9
p.c. on capital as against 20.6, 17.4, 8.2,
20.8 and 27.7 p.c. back to 1929.
At 725. the scrip returns 3.4 p.c. on a
124- p.c. div. basis, with prospects.

The £23,843 was 9.7 p.c. on capital; but
the p. and 1. debit (£81,648) and the size
of the overdraft (£84,905), both legacies
of drought losses in 1929, stood in the
way of a div., and seem likely to for a
while. Fewer sheep were shorn, yet the
clip was heavier, and there were 46,565
more jumbucks on the runs at the end of
Dec. than there were a year earlier,
thanks to favorable seasonal conditions
and a good lambing on both properties
(one is in western N. S. Wales and the
other in the south-west of Queensland).
But, owing to the fall in prices, sales plus

thing was struck off for mortality, which
called for £8247 in the previous term.
The spring in the net result was £23,607.
The year’s more profitable trading is
further reflected in the financial position:
1924. 1930. 1933. 1934.

less liquids exceeded outside liabilities by
£26,852, an improvement of £27,867 over
the twelvemonth. On fixed assets £14,124
more was written off than was spent.
At the moment the co.’s runs are well
grassed and well stocked, but the price
of the staple is lighter than it was a year
ago. The Queensland Government intends
to resume one-third of the co.’s Thurul-
goona leases during the current year ; the
Quantambone (N.S.W.) leases “fall in”
during 1968-73, and are subject to re-
sumptions of one-quarter in 1935 and
one-eighth in 1943 and 1948 respectively.
The market prices the 30s. paid shares
at 15s. 6d. (19s. a year ago), thus valu-
ing the undertaking at £35,900-odd less
than its net tangible book figure.

*Met by issue of fully-paid B prefs.
This one of the Hume group turns out
concrete-lined steel pipes from Austra-
lian plates fabricated by B.H.P. For
rights it handed 250,000 fully-paid
£1 ords. to the parent, the Hume Pipe
Co. To help finance the business, the
public put up £61,237 in 50,000 A and
11,237 B prefs., both 10 p.c. non-cumu-
lative. The Bs include 5567 shares
issued instead of cash in payment of
the 1933 div. Since the close of accounts
the As and Bs have been consolidated
in first prefs., carrying a fixed cumulative
1\ p.c. This will call for £4593 p.a., and
only twice in the last nine years have net
earnings failed to exceed that.
The main source of earnings is public
expenditure on water-supply schemes,
etc.; hence the collapse of the figures in
1931 and subsequent recovery. Last
year the co.’s net earnings shot up £4895,
reaching £12,682, or nearly three times
present pref. div. requjiremients. Be-
cause of this and other things, the
market prices the fully-paid pound prefs.
at 225. 9d. as against 13s. a year ago.
At the higher figure the return is 6.6 p.c.
Prospects are that, “given the neces-
sary finance, a large volume of business
should be available during the next two
or three years,” the board says. No
hint is given as to how it proposes to
raise whatever funds may be required ;
in the past the co. has gone into debt to
finance expansion of the business. Here
is the position so far as balance-sheet
figures show it:

The co. sold its foreign rights to the
Steel Pipe and Lining Co. for £500,000
in f.p. ords., and took 20,000 8 p.c.
cum. prefs. for cash. It took the scrip
into its own books at £154,528, reducing
the patents item (now £100,900, not
treated as an asset herein) by £152,824.
Subsidiaries have bought the rights for
S. Africa, India and part of the U.S.A.,
and those for Japan have been sold on
a royalty basis. What the royalty
amounts to has not been announced, nor
is any hint given as to how the Lining
Co. is getting along. The rights for the
F.M.S., Straits Settlements and China
have been taken over by Hume Pipe (Far
East), Ltd. After paying 8 p.c. cumu-
lative on capital invested in the steel-
pipe business, half of any remaining
profit therefrom goes to the vendor.

For the investor one of the chief lessons
to be learnt from the history of this
manufacturer is the influence of plant
upon earnings, and, therefore, upon the
worth of the scrip. After some years
of varying fortunes, the war provided
the co. with a high degree of protection
and a brisk turnover, thus enabling a run
of over-liberal 15 p.c. divs. to be paid.
Then, during the post-war boom, the
price of wool shot up, competition grew
steadily keeper and mechanical and other
developments, most of them affecting the
cost of production, left the co. with
equipment less modern than most of its
competitors. The plant failed to earn
any profit at all. Indeed, for the five
years to the close of accounts in 1928
losses aggregated £140,929, of which
£109,695 was special provision for de-
preciation. To tidy up the accounts

DRY GINGER ALE *- A
£144,000 was lopped off capital, reducing
it to £96,000.
At the end of 1929 a further £38,400
of capital went down the sink ; a new co.
of the same name took over the old one
for £57,600 in scrip, and £10,292 of 9 p.c.
pref. money was gathered to enable
looms and scouring and dye-house equip-
ment, etc., to be remodelled. Losses for
the two years to Sept., 1931, totalled
£20,802. Then exchange and the tariff
turned the tide, and earnings over the
last three years enabled the co. to clean
the prefs.’ slate and wipe out the p. and
1. debit, thus clearing the way for the
ords.
During the last term gross earnings
(£8766) slipped £7022, The net result was
£4737 lighter at £6328. This enabled the
co. to bring the pref. payments up to date
and wipe out intangibles. The £6328 was
sufficient to pay a full year’s pref. div.
(reduced to 7 p.c. from the beginning of
the term) and show 9.7 p.c. on ord.
capital.

Australian Alloy Steel
During the last half of 1934 Australian
Alloy Steel (Sydney), which manufac-
tures ploughshares and general steel cast-
ings, made more profit than for the pre-
ceding 12 months, when 7.4 p.c. was
netted on the £39,009 of capital. Low
costs and the quality of its products have
won the co. some valuable connections,
and continued expansion of the business
appears to be assured, for some time at
any rate. To separate the buying and
selling from the manufacturing side of
the undertaking, and further reduce costs,
a subsidiary, Australian Alloy Steel
(Sales), has been formed. It is offering
5000 7 p.c. cum. prefs. at par, and isn’t
likely to have any difficulty in keeping up
the payments.
Upper Watut Alluvials
Mt. Lawson Prospecting and Options
Syndicate’s first-born, Upper Watut Gold
Alluvials, N.L., is a youngster with pos-
sibilities. Nominal capital is £200,000 in
ss. shares, of which 600,000, which were
firmly underwritten, have been offered
and snapped. Syndicate shareholders had
prior right to 187,500 of them. The
vendor takes 200,000 paids, plus £8625
cash, the amount spent on partly testing
the properties. These consist of three
leases on the Upper Watut, New Guinea,
on the opposite side of the mountain to
Bulolo Gold Dredging. The total quan-
tity of wash available is 16,000,000 c.y.
or more, approximate details of which
are as follows:
f ——Lease N
Wales’s. Leahy’s. Mainko.
Untested c.y, .. 4,232,000 4,500,7)00 5,000,000
Tested c.y. .. 838,000 1,312,000
Total c.y. .. 5,070,000 5,812,000 5,000,000
Only about one-eighth of the available
wash has been systematically tested. This
was done by pitting on the three-chain
grid system and sluicing the material
through boxes fitted with primitive riffles.
With gold at £8 an ounce (Australian
currency), average values were 4s. 4.7 d.
a yard on Leahy’s, and 3s. 9.9 d. on
Wales’s lease, the average for the whole
of the tested area being 3s. 7.3 d. The
river bed, expected to be richer than the
flats, was not tested, and some payable
stuff is known to exist outside the meas-
ured areas. On the untested portion
of the flats (they are about 15 chains
wide), dish prospects encourage the
hope that average values will be main-
tained.
It is a sluicing proposition, the wash
being compact gravel, free of clay with
little overburden; few large boulders
were met with. Three engineers each
figure costs at Is. a yard. With an out-
put of 3000 c.y. a day, the life of the
three properties combined is about 17
years. It is proposed to instal a 1500-
h.p. hydro-electric plant, which will leave
the co. with 25 p.c. surplus power for
expansion.
Everything depends upon the value of
the untested ground. In figuring profits
the prospectus assumes that the
16,000,000 c.y. will average 3s. ; an extra
3d. is added to costs, making them
Is. 3d., leaving a working profit of
Is. 9d. a yard, or £80,500 p.a. on a
yearly turnover of 920,000 c.y. Over 17
years that would be sufficient to return
the capital (£200,000) and show an aver-
age of over 34 p.c. p.a. thereon.
A syndicate is being formed in Syd-
ney to take up the old Lone Hand,
about 30 miles from Uralla (N.S.W.)
and eight miles south of the once-
famous Baker’s Creek mine, which was
profitably worked to a depth of over
2000 ft. The Lone Hand was last worked
by a co. in the late eighties of last cen-
tury, when some very rich stuff was
taken out; unwise expenditure and in-
efficient treatment methods were the
chief troubles. The present holder of
the leases, J. B. Thomson, has worked
them practically single-handed for the
last 10 years ; he was connected with the
old co. during its short period of pro-
duction. There are 10 gold-bearing
reefs, the most important of which
appears to be No. 3 ; it is expected to
average over 7dwt., and is 3ft. wide
where cut by a rise. Where exposed,
others are narrower and richer. The in-
tention is to put up 10-head of stamps,
concentrating tables and a small cyanid-
ing plant, and further develop the show,
which has a good chance of being
brought to life again.
* * * *
Gas Drillers, an offshoot of Oil Search,
has commenced drilling on a closed
structure at Mulgoa (N.S.W.). Thus
favored geologically, the co, claims to
have a better chance of meeting with
natural gas (a commercial proposition
in several centres in North America)
than had any previous deep bore into the
upper coal measures underlying Sydney
and the surrounding districts.
* * * sfc
The fall in the head value of ore
treated at Mt. Coolon (Q.) is due to
the inclusion of low-grade stuff outside
the recognised reserves. This will extend
the life of the mine until September
next. The average grade of stone yet
to be drawn will be substantially better
than that recently crushed, the manager
says. The co. has abandoned its other
interests in North Queensland. Develop-
ments at the New Morning Star, Wood’s
Point (Vic.), in which Coolon and Gold
Mines of Australia are interested, are
promising.
* * * *
Oriomo Explorations has added an-
other string to its bow by taking an
option over 150 acres of dredging and
sluicing ground along the Bulolo River,
New Guinea.
* * * *
Besides a 50 p.c. interest in Yellow-
dine Gold Option, Commonwealth Min-
ing and Finance, one of the De Bernales
group, has four other shows in West-
ralia and one, the Hercules, in the North-
ern Territory. Here trial shafts are being
sunk to intercept a lode which assays
1.350 z. gold and 6oz. silver where it
outcrops. At the Phcenix (Bayley’s
Reward) equipment and reconditioning
work are well advanced, and borehole
sites have been selected. A million-
gallons-a-day Pomona pump is being in-
stalled at the Sand Queen-Gladsome,
which also has a treatment plant on the
spot. The co. figures that there is 50,000
tons of 13dwt. stuff above the 800 ft. level.
At the Aladdin the lodes “appear to be
of great width and of profitable grade.”
Stuff taken from No. 2 shaft panned
15dwt., while 6dwt. to Bdwt. stone has
been disclosed in an 86ft. winze 106 ft.
south of the main shaft. At the Atlas
shaft-sinking, etc., to 135 ft. has dis-
closed ore, width not yet determined,
worth from Bdwt. to 12dwt.
* * * *
The outstanding achievement of
Anglo-Australian Gold Development,
another of the De Bernales group, has
been the flotation of its first subsidiary,
Beryl Gold Corporation, which brought
in (1) £200,000 cash and 400,000 f.p. ss.
shares as vendor’s consideration, (2)
£24,545 in repayment of a loan, and (3)
the right, until March 31, 1936, to buy
200,000 new shares at 7s. 6d. each.
Anglo, which also holds a 20 p.c. interest
in Yellowdine, will thus be able to give
more attention to the development of its
other Westralian properties, which in-
clude the Wheel of Fortune, Apex and
Mars. In cash the co. has about £lOO,OOO
in Australia and £30,000 in London.
* * * *
Paringa’s prospects are again being
boosted.' Extensive boring has been
done during the past year, and results
“have exceeded the directors’ anticipa-
tions.” To date the co. has spent about
£20,000 on reopening its old Kalgoorlie
show. Early in 1934 706,000 new Is.
shares were issued at a premium of Is.
sterling. Most of the premium (£35,345)
was mopped up in writing-off accumu-
lated losses. At present there are 279,300
new shares under option at 4s. each,
and these are expected to be taken. It
will be a while before the property can
be systematically developed at depth.
Still, all the lodes are practically intact.
The proposition is therefore very dif-
ferent from that of reopening an old
mine which has been clipped of ore in
the upper levels. Dr. Larcombe says
Paringa is one of the most important
properties north of the Golden Mile.
* * * *
At the end of 1934 Lake Austin
Eureka (W.A.), floated in Sept, last, had
£7544 in the bank ; the mine, etc., figured
at £14,000, while £lOO3 was spent on
plant, £1353 on development and £1609
on preliminary exes. Paid capital stood
at £24,980, and there was £9OO coming
to the vendor, since paid. On the new
Ironclad lease (24 acres) there are “many
thousands of tons” of Bdwt. to 9dwt. ore,
which can be mined at a cost of ss. to 6s.
a ton. The recently-acquired Reward
(12 acres), which adjoins the co.’s main
holding on the south, has been “favor-
ably” reported upon by W. M. Deeble.
Two five-head batteries are on their way
to the mine.
* * * *
Princess Royal’s latest Westralian
option is the Champion, -on the North
Coolgardie field, near Leonora. In the
past it was a producer in a small way ;
now it is reckoned to be better than
ever. The Princess proposes to unwater,
sample and see for itself.
* * * *
After spending £BOOO or thereabouts,
New Venture says it has solved the water
problem at the Redemption, Coolgardie
(W.A.). Reconditioning of the recently
waterlogged workings is now well in
hand, and an investigation of the gold-
carriers in sight is about to take place.
So far New Venture has had more than
its fair share of troubles in trying to make
money out of goldmining.
* * * *
Since old goldmines have become
scarce in the West, company promoters
are now turning attention to alluvial
patches and leads with a past. Reserva-
tions have been pegged at Bulong, and
there is some talk of a large area being
taken up at Kurnalpi. A lot of wealth
was obtained by fossickers in both places
in the ’nineties ; although some was, per-
haps, left behind, it would be wise to
count the cost before finding money to
get it.
* * * #
Lancefield’s new mill, in which the
flotation-roasting-cyanidation method of
ore treatment has been adopted, is ready
to make a start immediately the strike is
over. This treatment has proved suc-
cessful at Wiluna and Kalgoorlie. When
in full swing, the plant is scheduled to
put through 120,000 tons a year.
* * * *
Gold Fields Australian Development
has divided its £1 shares into four of ss.
each, and has applied to the London
Stock Exchange for listing. The co.’s
chief asset is the Moonlight group,
Wiluna (W.A.), which it bought from
Claude de Bernales in 1932, and which
diamond-drilling, crosscutting and driv-
ing have proved to be a mine.
* * * *
For many years Sons of Gwalia was
the only mine worked at Leonora
(W.A.). Now several shows are being
opened up, the most promising of which
is Leonora Central; it used to be the
old Harbor Lights, which yielded some
high-grade stone at shallow depths. H.
Annear, of Edna May, is in charge.
* * * *
On the advice of its consulting en-
gineer, F. Leahy, General Mining Corp.,
a Melbourne prospecting concern, has
taken options over the Lady Mary, Lucky
Call and Iron Duke at Norseman (W.A.).
* * * *
The directors of Norseman (W.A.)
have called in C. G. Gibson to make a
thorough geological examination of the
mine and advise as to the future work-
ing thereof.
* * * *
As a result of the strike at the princi-
pal goldmines in Westralia, many small
cos. outback have been able to obtain
first-class machine-miners from the
Golden Mile. These men are at a
premium.
* * * *
At Jan. 25 New Golconda (W.A.) had
spent £2750 on development and plant,
£4733 on flotation and had £27,485 in the
bank. A favorable report on the co.’s
mine by a Westralian mining engineer is
in the hands of the board.
* * * *
Perth Mint reports good business in old
gold, such as bangles, brooches, rings,
etc. During 1934 it received and melted
£39,471 worth. Apart from the Mint,
private buyers paid out thousands of
pounds for trinket discards.
* * * *
Dr. Wade recommends the Freney
Kimberley Oil Co. (W.A.) to continue
its investigations. There is no doubt, he
says, that petroleum has been formed in
rocks on portion of the co.’s area, but
whether it has been preserved remains to
be proved. Between April and Dec. last
year he examined 10,000 square miles of
the co.’s holding ; still his investigations
are incomplete, which means that present
deductions are subject to modification
or alteration by subsequent disclosures.
BRIEF ANSWERS.
Ashgrove: Subject to economic developments,
bank earnings may be expected to improve.
The other is one of the most speculative stocks
on the market... .H.A.D.: If unable to keep
up payments, ask for a paid-up policy....
Gouger: Prospects more encouraging than
recent bore results suggest K.H.: H01d....
Enr. Bee: Co. is still in the prospecting stage;
it appears to have a fair chance of success.

“The Only Girl”
By Ufa out of Gaumont, and, like
most half-breds, a sufferer from the de-
fects of both sides of the family. The
British stars overplay, the Germans are
slow and solemn and all the males are
heavily made up.
The musical-comedy atmosphere is
heightened by the naughty nineteenth-
century plot—the one about the missing
garter. Lilian Harvey (English and
sprightly) loses it, and Charles Boyer
(German and glum) picks it up shortly
before he has a fall in the hunting-field ;
one of those mishaps in the operatic
tradition which leave the hero blinded
and ostensibly at the point of death,
but capable of falling in love with the
heroine’s voice.
Boyer is an eighteenth-century duke
and Miss Harvey is the Empress’s maid.
The complications arise from the fact
that the garter belongs to the Empress.
Ernest Thesiger (English and actorish)
provides most of the comedy as a Court
Chamberlain. His business might be
effective on a stage, but it isn’t cinema,
or anything like it. The advts. always
describe Miss Harvey as elfin, and she
lives up to her reputation till it hurts.
Her caperings and grimacings as she
listens to a conversation between the
Duke and the Empress are particularly
trying. Some of the outdoor settings are
picturesque. At Sydney Civic.
“Straight Is the Way”
Here the producer seems to have been
torn between a desire to construct (1) a
mother movie, starring May Robson;
(2) a gangster, with Jack Larue, Nat
Pendleton and two or three of those
grim-faced extras who are always to be
seen in crime-films standing about rooms
with their hats on, and glowering homi-
cidally as a background for the Big
Shot; (3) a love-idyll for Franchot Tone
and Karen Morley.
The result of this embarrassment of
specialists is a work which defies classi-
fication. May Robson, as the adoring
Hebrew mother of Franchot Tone (just
out of gaol), is hardly into her lugubrious
stride when Jack Larue, deadly and

at Sydney Embassy.
almost as silent as a snake, takes com-
mand of the picture ; and through it all
Karen Morley, symbolising the maidenly
virtues, fights with brazen Gladys George
for the love of Franchot Tone. The
scene in which Larue gets killed is ex-
citing, but. it’s a dull affair on the whole.
Also at the Civic.
“Bachelor of Arts”
Why Hollywood persists in trudging
along worn plot-grooves years after the
U.S.A. magazines have finished with
them is hard to discover. “Bachelor of
Arts” is another example of the habit.
Tom Brown, inspired thereto by Anita
Louise, decides, though the son of a
millionaire, to work his way through col-
lege. His father assists by cutting off
supplies. To send the sickly wife of a
dear old professor (Henry B. Walthall)
off on a health jaunt, the young hero
Gerald du Maurier as Weissensee in
“Jew Siiss.”
works in a restaurant and undergoes
bipod transfusion. What would have
happened if the heroine had been Clara
Bow instead of Miss Louise, and if Mr.
Brown’s dad, instead of being overcome
by sentiment, as soon as Miss Louise
fiddled with his tie, had remembered his
age, were among the subjects for bored
speculation which “Bachelor of Arts”
induced in the writer. At Sydney Capitol.
“I Am a Thief”
Another train romance. Fully half
the footage is taken up with shots
of the wheels of locomotives commenc-
ing to revolve and pictures of trains
speeding through landscapes. In be-
tween, Ricardo Cortez and Mary Astor
move languidly through a sequence
of false alarms. Almost anybody on the
train could have stolen the necklace, and
almost everybody on the train is con-
victed of stealing it. When it finally
transpires that the German baron and
not the French count, the Kentucky
colonel or Mr. Cortez is to be sent to
Devil’s Island, the impulse of any fair-
minded onlooker is to say it’s a crook
deal. Also at the Capitol,
“The Lives of a Bengal Lancer”
A trite title, a plot that melodramatises
North-West Frontier skirmishing on
hackneyed lines, and the fact that at least
three of the Lancer officers have Ameri-
can accents and mannerisms are handi-
caps over which this talkie triumphs by
sheer good acting and efficient produc-
tion. The spirit that animates British
rule in India is glorified to a degree that
would satisfy Kipling himself.
Gary Cooper (supposedly Canadian)
and Franchot Tone (ex “the Blues”) are
a pair of graceless subalterns. Richard
Cromwell is the, colonel’s son, foisted on
the regiment by his American mother
against the old man’s wishes. The
colonel is a vignette from real life ; mar-
tinet type, worried about his responsibili-
ties, bending backward to avoid any sus-
picion of partiality towards his own
youngster. C. Aubrey Smith is the com-
plete British adjutant.
Dialogue throughout is terse, bright
and effective. Pictures of military opera-
tions, including many glimpses that take
in a whole cavalry regiment manoeuvring,
are impressive ; there are some good pig-
sticking scenes, and though the Ameer
and the beautiful Circassian lady with
whom he lures subalterns to their doom
derive from the Guy Boothby school of
fiction they are dovetailed into the pic-
ture neatly enough. Previewed at Syd-
Paramount theatrette; to be shown at
Sydney Prince Edward on Saturday.
“One Great Adventure”
A romance about jewel-thieves which
gets round the League of Decency ukase
against glorifying criminals. Binnie
Barnes has pinched jewels in every Euro-
pean capital; she likes the way they
glitter. Paul Cavanagh is another world-
famed collector, and he, too, merely
covets the stones for their beauty. He
wants Miss Barnes to join up with him
in Paris, where he runs a night club, but
Neil Hamilton butts in and reforms the
lady by his love. Acting, photography
and direction are excellent. At Sydney
Regent.
“Over the Garden Wall”
At Sydney Lyceum. Margaret Ban-
nerman, as an ultra-modern aunt, and
Marian Marsh, late, of Hollywood, waste
their considerable talents in this flat Eng-
lish farce. It chiefly concerns Bobby
Howes’s efforts to gain Marian’s hand in
face of strenuous opposition from his and
her relations.
“Gentlemen Are Born”
A depression-problem play. The prob-
lem is how college graduates whose folk
don’t own businesses are to find employ-
ment. Franchot Tone gets a job as a
reporter ; others are less successful. How-
ever, they make merry, make love and
even marry on 20 bucks a week, which
seems to be U.S.A. for basic wage.
Eventually Mr. Tone marries Margaret
Lindsay, the millionaire’s daughter. The
serious happenings are much too melo-
dramatic to ring true.
“Corroboree”
Recently screened privately in Sydney,
this Fearn Steele short depicts the cus-
toms of aborigines in the wild state. The
initiation ceremonies and the tribal cor-
roboree are interesting. In addition to
being worth a place on any programme
Paul Graetz as Landauer in “Jew Siiss.”
the film is a valuable record of a phase
of abo. life that can’t survive much
longer.
“Hawaiian Nights”
A wild fantasy in which sound com-
edians like Mary Boland, Polly Moran,
Sidney. Fox and Ned Sparks try hard to
be funny and fail.
Some First Nights
The Fuller opera cd.’s “Tosca” was
disappointing. Puccini’s music is so
glowingly congenial to the voice and
Sardou’s melodrama is so direct and
vigorous in its effects that the opera
should have called forth the best vocal

a Jew in “Jew Siiss.”
and histrionic talent of which the com-
pany is capable. Instead the acting was
feeble and the singing undistinguished.
Molly de Gunst, who made a very sym-
pathetic Aida a couple of years ago,
proved unsuited to the role of Floria
Tosca. Her enunciation was disjointed
and her voice seemed as hard as flint. The
Scarpia of Mr. de Vries, while bodily im-
passive, vocally tore passions to small
shreds and trampled on them. Such
honors as were going went to Browning
Mummery, who seemed to enjoy the
music Puccini has allotted to Cavara-
dossi, and made his audience enjoy it
too. The last act, with its whip-snap
climax went well, carrying the company
with it, and applause was generous,
Frank Neil’s latest revue, “In Town To-
night,” at Melbourne Tivoli, is a series
of revels in form and color. Honors
go to scenic-artist McGuinnes, electri-
cian E. Berysford, Mesdames Sherring-
ham, Hogan and Guest, who attended to
the costuming, and Hilda Waring, who
trained the numerous ballets. One effec-
tive scene forms the background of a
Wine Ballet, in which Nature is possibly
the most important costumier, for the
Folies Bergeres never produced anything
nuder. Following this spectacle is one
in which Michel and Arnova reveal their
mastery of movement in an interpretative
dance —also clothed in a manner which
would make Sydney’s Eric Spooner
shed tears. Some of the comedy turns
scattered through the show are funny,
some are funny and vulgar, and some
are vulgar without being funny. The
straight turns provided by Ray Vaughn
and the Eastern Brothers are excellent.
Such humor as is going is provided by
Jane Ayr, Sid Field and Alec Pleon.

Fears that the Sydney Cri. would cease
to function as a theatre have been

Moncrieff and Claude Flemming head
a strong cast.

ABORIGINALITIES
Nobody need smile or ob-
serve that the bull climbed up the tree.
It happened to the Rev. H. E. Hayes,
of Mernda (Vic.). Finding 34 snake-eggs,
the padre put eight of them in a match-
box and, placing it in his pocket, caught
the train to Melbourne. Mernda isn't
very far out, but before the train had
covered half the distance he felt some-
thing moving and opened the matchbox.
Three baby serpents slid out on the
floor of the railway carriage. Following
the Biblical injunction, Mr. Hayes
bruised them beneath his heel —bruised
them until they were safely defunct.
* * * *
“Peter D.”: Have Abdliars heard of
the “splinter-puller”? At Blaxland
(N.S.W. Blue Mountains) I was troubled
with a splinter in a finger. A local young-
ster, after hunting for a while among
the branches of a wattle-tree, ran to earth
an insect about three-quarters of an inch
long with a hard, light-blue-and-black
casing. This obliging little cuss, after
being placed on my finger, gripped the
splinter with the nippers at the end of
his snout and extracted it. As I felt no
pain I assume that he gave me a local
anaesthetic. I suppose he has a name
other than the vernacular one.
* * * *
“L.J.L.”: As an old bushman —a strict
teetotaller —I should like to know the
name of a snake about sft. long,
canary yellow in color and with what
looked like a frill round the neck. Judg-
ing by its thickness it was a species of
whip-snake. Saw it near Holbrook
(N.S.W.).
“The Missus”: Reverse-action snakes
(B. 16/l/’35)? The fire had been made
and I was ready to start the day’s wash
when a 2ft. tree-snake detached itself
from the shade of a near-by bush and
disappeared under the copper. Rushing
inside I grabbed a cane walking-stick
and a hastily-rolled taper. When I
set fire to the kindling that snake
didn’t wait to turn round before he made
a dash for the open —and I didn’t wait
till he got out of reverse before I killed
my first wriggler.
* * * *
“Selma”: Those ’possums that called
for their captured youngster and then
dropped the infant when escaping had
a clumsy child (B. 16/1/’35). Our old
lady ’possum, who comes along about
three times a year with a new baby to
show us, always bears the infant on
her back, and so tightly does he cling
that we have hard work to dislodge him
for kindly inspection. Even when the
baby dismounts to sample a piece of
cake he will spring expertly into position
on mother’s back at the first hint of
alarm, and in this manner he travels
until he is well-grown and almost ready
to look round for a roof of his own.
* * * *
“Eureka”: “What kind of a bird is
that?” the new hand asked Dave, point-
ing to a bird wading in the swamp.
“That’s a heron,” Dave told him. “By
Jove, they look different when they’re
kippered!” the new hand remarked.
/#* * *
“Bogaduck”: If told that a marksman
had scored a magpie and an inner
with the one shot, most rifle-shooters
would declare it to be impossible. We
members of the Bordertown (S.A.) Club
know better. Charlie Bishop, firing at
the 400-yard mark, let drive just as a
magpie flew across the range. Bird and
bullet met half-way down the range ; the
maggie dropped dead, and the bullet,
not in the least deflected, went on to
strike the target just outside the margin
of the bull’s-eye.

“Kwakprak”: A Norwegian scientist
has risked his life by drinking about a
teaspoonful of “heavy water” in order to
“Prithee, Sir George, fight warily! It hath been said that yon dragon is half
Alsatian!”
test its effects on the human body. At a
cost of £2O it was, proportionate to quan-
tity, one of the most expensive drinks
since Cleopatra’s pearl-cocktail. “Heavy
water” exists in minute quantity in ordi-
nary water, and possesses some very re-
markable physical and physiological
properties. It is fatal to most plants and
seeds, even in high dilution, but the weep-
ing willow will extract it from a mixture
with ordinary water, and seems to thrive
on it. It and the “heavy hydrogen” of
which it is a combination with oxygen
are being worked at in laboratories all
over the world. There is reason to expect
that they may prove helpful in elucidat-
ing the cancer problem.
* * * *
“Bull-ant Bill”: Wire fences as a light-
ning danger to stock? At Baryulgil,
near Grafton (N.S.W.), on January 26 a
flash ran for 15 chains along a wire fence
and killed 21 cows and two horses shelter-
ing near it. A tree to which the wire was
stapled was shattered, each of the auger-
holes in the posts through which the
wire passed was charred, and the grass
round the feet of the stricken animals
was withered and burnt. In Queensland
recently several chains of wire were
melted into globules by a flash.
* * ❖ He
“’Weightchaser”: Seeing that money
can be found to equip expedition after
expedition to find “Lasseter’s lost reef” it
might be worth someone’s while to lead a
party in search of the vanished gold from
the old Extended Union mine in the N.T.,
which has just been reopened. Its dis-
appearance vies with that of Leichhardt.
The original locaters of the mine in 1897
—Roberts, Stark, Houschildt and Nol-
tenius—took out 800 oz. in the first
month. They decided to make for Dar-
win with the stuff, which was loaded on
a packhorse tied close to their hut. They
had some liquor supplies, and decided
to finish these off before making tracks
for Darwin. The subsequent noise made
the packhorse break away and take to
the bush. The party did not find this
out until later, and when they searched
for him he and the gold had vanished
for good. All the party, save Roberts,
were killed by blacks a couple of years
later, so the gold is fair game for anyone
who can find it, Roberts having joined
his mates to prospect on the Golden
Shore long ago.
* # * *
“Whizz”: Whether poisoned grass-
hoppers account for native birds or not,
I am satisfied that motor-cars in com-
bination with the hopping pests do a
bit in that line. Recently a friend drove
down to Melbourne in his car. On the
Victorian side of the border he found
the road covered by crawling hoppers,
with magpies in numbers feeding on
them in the roadway. Further, the road
was dotted with maggie corpses and
those of a small green parrot. He put
the casualties down to poisoned ’hoppers
until his next stop, when he found that
the ’hoppers were not thick enough for
poisoning thereabout. The dead birds,
he was told, had been outed by the
cars, most of them travelling at high
speed on the empty road. The ’hop-
pers crossing the open road were an
irresistible bait to the magpies, many of
which misjudged their distance and were
caught by the flying cars. Whether the
parrots were after ’hoppers also could
not be said, but they, too, contributed
their quota to the slain.
* * * *
“Notaden”: “Ophir’s” reef-snake (B.
23 /1 / ’35) was really a reef-eel. Some
species grow up to 10ft. or more, and
most are fierce, pugnacious creatures,
ready to tackle anything. There are lots
of sea-snakes, too, in N.Q. waters, but if
any of them were to really bite “Ophir’s”
dog that faithful animal would be in the
canine heaven in less time than it would
take him to bury a bone in this hard
world. All are poisonous, but, luckily,
their mouths are too small to allow them
to get a good enough grip to drive in
the fangs. The eels hang on like bull-
dogs, having good wide mouths, but they
have no poison. If they had the Barrier
Reef would be a highly unpopular place
for tourists.
H* * ❖
“Camou”; I agree with “Cooloothin”
(B. 30/1/’35) that a waistcoat worn with-
out a coat is a seemly garment, and not
in the least calculated to make a man
appear a scoundrel. If a man really
wants to cultivate a tough aspect I advise
him to fake off his collar and tie a hand-
kerchief —preferably a dirty red one —
round his neck, at the same time retain-
ing coat and waistcoat. The first time
I tried it —following the tip of Henry
Kingsley, who in his “Ravenshoe” makes
his broken hero don a “Belcher” when
applying for a groom’s job—l got so
scared after the first look in the glass
that I changed my money from the right
to the left pocket in case I should be
tempted to commit robbery with violence
on myself.
* * * *
“Emarelle”: Churchgoing at Rendel-
sham (S.A.) has the spice of variety. A
swarm of bees has its home in the build-
ing (used by all denominations), and at
an afternoon service the excited buzzers
stung eight members of the congregation,
two twice. And three early-comers
found a 4ft. snake coiled on the doorstep.
It beat them to it, and made a beeline
down the aisle to the organ, where it
went into retreat. The instrument was
dragged to pieces in quick time, and the
wriggler found in the bellows. The
slaughter had just ended when the parson
arrived.
* -5 *
“Kwa”: I, too, have smoked wild-
musk, paper-bark, tea-leaves and other
far less refined things when travel-
ling with camels in Centralia, but the
Melville Island abo. showed me some
points in scraping up a smoke when out
of tobacco. When he is short of weed
he pounds up his clay-pipe and smokes
the powder in the claw of a large crab.
When the clay is consumed the crab-claw
is broken up and smoked in yet another
claw, and so on until the last one neither
tastes nor smells of tobacco. Writer can
recommend the powder of the clay-pipe
and the first half-dozen crab-claws, but
the last 20 claws are frankly horrible.
* * * *
“Wagga”; A cyclone which struck
Charlton (Vic.) recently produced some
interesting groupings of objects. From
one house the whole roof was carried
away in one section. Next day a towns-
man found it sitting on top of a big tree,
like a giant hat.
* * * *
Touching those tame Murray
cod (B. 16/l/’35): There is a deep hole
in the Warrego, about 16 miles n.-w 7 . of
Charleville (Q.), where half a dozen
fishermen have established a “cod farm”
that has survived the last six years. One
may pull up and call for cod any
weight between 31b. and 301 b. Dozens
are tethered to stakes on the bank. They
are fed with mice, wood-grubs and frogs.
Each stake is marked, showing the
weight, and the price is Is. per lb., large
or small.
* * * *
“Havana Harbor”: A Sydney paper
publishes a photograph of some New
Hebridean natives armed with what it
calls the “modern” Snider rifle. The pic-
ture shows that the “modern” weapon is
the same as when the British Army
relinquished it, without regret, for the
Martini nearly 70 years ago. The Snider
is an excellent example of the British
spirit of compromise. When the Euro-
pean armies had adopted breechloaders
after the Franco-Prussian War, Britain
called for some means of converting its
huge stocks of Enfield muzzleloaders to
breechloaders. Snider came to the
rescue, and the rifle named after him,
the muzzle velocity of which is in in-
verse ratio to its kicking power, was
issued to the services. Thrown on
a cold world, the Sniders found their
way in large quantities to the Islands.
The first British New Guinea police
were armed with them, and they were
to Billy MacGregor what Brown Bess
was to Wellington. Ammunition has been
the trouble of the Kanaka Snider-owner,
for it has always been hard to get.
* * * *
“Natur”: Recordings of phenomenal
growths needn’t always be leg-pullers. At
my home near Sydney some shoots from
a wistaria vine ran under the house un-
checked. In eight months they arrived at
the back, a distance of 55ft. The foliage
in the dark was quite cream, and the
stems were inclined to be flat.
* * * *
“Saltbush Bill”: A droving trip that
should make the hardiest of Aboliars sit
up has just ended in the far north of
Canada; the Lomen Co., of Nome, has
delivered a mob of 2500 reindeer at the
mouth of the Mackenzie River after a
trek of 2000 miles. The deer are intended
as food and clothing for the Canadian
Eskimos, and were handled by 10 drovers
with dogs innumerable but no horses —
travelling being by boot and snowshoe
only. Thirty years ago the U.S.A. im-
ported a herd of reindeer from Siberia to
Alaska. These increased to many hun-
dreds of thousands —the Lomen firm
alone can muster 200,000 head —and
have changed a mob of Eskimos liv-
ing precariously by fishing and seal-
catching to a flourishing pastoral com-
munity—in itself something of a miracle.
To Australians who have shared the
drover’s portion, the outstanding feature
of this bit of overlanding is that at in-
tervals the drovers had stores delivered to
them on the track by aeroplanes from
Nome.
THE POINT THAT COUNTS.
She’s forty, and perhaps a trifle more;
The roses on her cheeks are pink as ice
On Christmas cakes; she’s pretty sure to
snore;
Her stock of language isn’t always nice
Enough for Sunday schools. But what of that?
She’s got a heart that’s very quick to feel,
A buxom figure somewhat gone to fat,
And with it all a genuine appeal;
Not sex it ain’t, or things as hard to dub:
It’s just—she owns the pub!
Last night—I reckon it was nigh on ten,
When I was in the parlor with my jug;
Twas after hours, but beer tastes sweeter
then —
She comes in after serving some poor mug
And sits, a little wobbly, on the arm-
Piece of my chair and stroked my stubbly
chin.
“I haven’t altogether lost my charm,
Have I?” she asks. I gets a whiff of gin.
I never thought before to be her hub.
But, then—she owns the pub.
I hold her hand; half thinking of the score
I haven’t paid for months—if she’d forgot
I wouldn’t be a nark—and then, O Lpr’!
I said some things I rather wished I’d not.
But, then, what odds? These silly moments
come
To all of us; life’s like that, pretty queer.
And on the winter
nights I’ll have
my rum,
And summer won’t
go bad with
whips o’ beer,
And I’ve a pretty
decent taste in
grub;
And her —she owns the
pub.
The boys’ll laugh, I
know, when they
find out—
Me after forty years
o’ roaming,
hey?—
And I suppose a bloke’ll have to shout,
Or she can make it “free house” for the
day.
I told you she was pretty fat and that,
But, then, it’s just as true, her skin’s like
cream;
And, seeing I ain’t young and fairly flat,
It ain’t so bad —oh, no, it wasn’t a dream.
I’m not in love, perhaps, but here’s the rub:
You see, she owns the pub!

“Bogaduck”: Dick Cullen, profes-
sional fisherman at Nora Creina Bay
(S.A.), took me out fishing. After pull-
ing some time he rested on his oars and
said “Watch! ” Ahead of us was a huge
rock with a hole right through it; at
first all I could see was the clear green
sea water and the waving weeds below.
A gentle swell swept up to the
farther side of the rock, and as the water
rose in the cave the sunlight, shining
through it, brought to life a marvellous
play of color. First clear green, then a
glorious translucent blue, then every
imaginable shade of blue to deep indigo.
The water sank, and the shimmering
color faded back to green. This spot is
at the tip of the northern headland of
Nora Creina Bay, and can only be
reached by boat in calm weather.

“Tine”; In spite of shooting campaigns
the red deer in the South Island of
Maoriland are an increasing menace. A
recent official report shows that thou-
sands are destroying large tracts of beech
forest in the Ohau Mountain country on
the Otago-Canterbury border. In addi-
tion to barking young trees and eating
all seedlings, etc., the deer are the cause
of much damage when rooting up the
earth in autumn, endeavoring to get rid
of their antlers. With the first rains the
turned-up patches develop into land-
slips, which quickly increase in area. On
many of the sheep stations the deer are
eating out the grass. One unfortunate
breeder who laid in a big stock of turnips
for winter feed had them raided and
eaten.

“Airline”: How about a big-fish tale
for a change? Five of us, equipped with
heavy deep-sea tackle, were fishing off

the rocks at Lyttelton Heads (M.L.).
Within half an hour every one of us
either had a hook or line broken, so out
went the shark tackle on a line as thick
as window-cord. A bite was registered
immediately, and all hands set to work
to land the victim. To our amazement
we could make no impression on him;
quite the reverse, as a matter of fact,
He dragged the five of us, slowly but
surely, towards the water. In vain we
lay back and heaved; out he went. The
last few feet of line was looped over a
rock and we stood by to await results.
After a few minutes’ terrific strain the
line slackened suddenly. We pulled it
in and found that, even if the fish had
been too much for us, the line had proved
too solid for him. A huge jaw, fully
18 inches long, and fitted with rows of
razor-edged teeth, hung limply on the
hook! It resembled the jaw of a skate,
and the steady, unswerving strain which
he put on our lines proved the monster
to be some exceptionally large flat fish.

“Black Bonnet”: In the Mitchell
River, about four miles from the Cook-
town Crossing, below Mareeba (N.Q.),
a most extraordinary snake was captured
in a fishtrap. It had evidently entered
after the fish—it had swallowed
two good-sized bream—and, un-
able to retreat, had drowned. It
was 6ft. long, of a dirty brown
color, slightly mottled, with the
head of an ordinary snake—the
tail tapered abruptly like an
adder’s. When it
was held by the
head the fish it had
swallowed slipped
down to the tail;
when held by the
tail the fish slipped
to the head. The
skin (preserved) is
strange in that there
are no scales, but
the surface re-
semb 1 e s a very
coarse rasp. Archie
McDowall, a keen and trained naturalist
familiar with northern oddities, had no
name for it. He thought that the skin
was that of a water snake he had heard
of from the natives, who were very much
afraid of it when it came to the surface ;
according to them it “whistled.”
* * * *
“M.G.”: Brush turkeys are becoming
rare birds in Victoria, and considerable
publicity was given to the fact that a
brood of chicks had been hatched at
Melb. Zoo. It has since been revealed
that the hen was herself hatched and
reared by Douglas Picking, an enthusiast
in breeding and rearing native birds and
animals. He has a reserve at Dromana,
and carries on his researches as unosten-
tatiously and as efficiently as any Farrer
or a Burbank.

“Vante”: At. Cracow goldfield (Q.)
a couple of years ago I had a severe
attack of scurvy. Following the advice
of a friend, I killed and ate a sand-
goanna. For the few days following I
felt full of energy, and was wide-awake
and alert for two or three weeks after-
wards. As a pick-me-up I can recom-
mend it.

“P.M.”: The abos. round Darwin
liked to puff at opium whenever the
opportunity occurred. The strange thing
about the smoking was that they did not
use the Chinese pipe, but a home-made
glass one—a lemonade-bottle with a hole
made in the side. It always beat me
how Binghi made the hole. It was neatly
drilled, and bore the appearance of the
workmanship of a super-craftsman.

feather ; but you need a helper to hold
the bag. Tap one old hen on the toes with
a four-foot batten. If she doesn’t lift her
leg at that, rub it against her shin.
She’ll lift. When she does, slip the
batten under where she can grab it.
She’ll grab. With one foot on work
the stick against her other leg. She’ll
lift that, too, and stand on the perch
with which you’ve supplied her. And she
won’t have taken her head from under
her wing during the whole process! In
flowing movements without jerks, work
that old hen round till she’s under your
armpit. From there she goes to the
bag while the stick is coaxing another
hen to lift her leg and grab the swaying
perch which is offered to her.
* * * *
“Aerogenes”: The imp of mischief
seems to dwell in some birds. My dog
is fond of chasing swallows as they fly
above him. He tears along, head in air,
after a bird perhaps 50ft. from the
ground. Some of the swallows have
caught on to the game, and deliberately
led him a dance over the lawn and
around shrubs. They reduce speed and
fly low so as to give him some en-
couragement. It’s hard on the dog, as
he runs himself thin at the game.
* * * *
“Kwa”: In common with abos. in
other parts of the Commonwealth, the
N.T. coastal tribes have their own particu-
lar “debbil-debbils,” but the Port Essing-
ton blacks have a unique method of lay-
ing theirs. When a burial is about to
take place a large fire is kindled at the
graveside, and the heads of several
shovel-nosed spears are heated until red-
hot. The corpse is now suspended in
position over the grave, and after the cus-
tomary chanting and blood-letting the
soles of the feet of the departed one are
branded with the hot spearheads. The
wandering spirit is then told that it has
very sore feet and that it will find noc-
turnal prowling a very painful busi-
ness. This ceremony must have the de-
sired effect, as the blacks will camp close
to a grave immediately after burial —a
thing most abos. would die before doing.
* * * *
“Bufo”: The old newspaper adage
concerning the relative news value of
bites as between dog and man has had a
new application in Colombo. A man
was fined there for biting a bull. Be-
coming annoyed with the animal—as
may very readily happen to non-Hindoos
in such places—he bit it on the tongue.
What the bull did in response is not
stated, but evidently the incident was
judged to have real news value.
* * * *
“Ophir”: Mention of Bert Tucker as a
drover (B. 19/12/’34) reminds me of the
time, in the early ’nineties, when his elder
sister had a lot of us young heathens in
her charge at the Longreach (C.Q.) Sun-
day school. She was giving us the Garden
of Eden story and trying to make us take
an interest in the show. She came to the
entrance of the serpent, and explained
that the serpent was a reptile. “Now,”
she said, appealing to our limited stock
of intelligence, “can any of you children
tell me of another reptile?” One
hazarded the idea that a snake was a
reptile. Teacher agreed. We ran through
all the snakes we knew—-brown, black,
tiger, carpet, python, death-adder, and
that about stumped us. One brave
urchin suggested a goanna. It was
accepted with reservations. We went
through that lot—frill lizard, carney, jew,
blue-tongue, wood-adder, and at that we
groped for another mental inspiration.
Punch Nolan got it! Red in the face,
bursting with information and import-
ance, spluttering and excited, he waved
his hand to attract the teacher’s attention.
“Well, Punch, what is it?” Punch let it
go with a run, as being too good to keep
to himself: “Please, Miss Tucker, a red-
back spider.” But Punch did not say
“back.” There was another term, more
expressive, vulgar, redolent of the bar-
parlor and the droving camp—and that
was the term Punch employed.
* * * *
“J.G.0.G.”: I had a bull-terrier that
used to hump his bluey. In winter
he would carry a cornsack all round
the place, following the sun. At the end
of the day Matilda was left in the same
spot beneath the house, although the
pup was never known to lie there—he
would always adjourn to the kennel after
sundown.
* * * *
“C.H.F.”: Our bantam rooster set up
claims to the one perch in the fowlhouse,
forbidding all but one of the hens to
occupy it. We removed the perch, and
at evening were rewarded by seeing the
rooster jump frenziedly into the air in
an endeavor to land on a perch that
wasn’t there. At length he turned
on his hen companion and gave
her beans. To save the hen’s life
we replaced the perch, and rooster and
mate were immediately restored to
friendly terms. A few days later we
again removed the perch: the rooster
repeated his previous performance. We
leave the perch in now, but the other hens
only look up miserably and longingly at
the lengthy roost that could comfortably
accommodate the lot.

“Cootharra”: Says Professor H.
Whiteridge Davies: “It is impossible to
collect any reliable Australian figures
regarding the period of survival of men
who subsequently died of thirst.” By
no means. In 1913, on the Murchison
(W.A.), an abo. (I was with him) tracked
and found the dead body of a man who
had been working with a re-sleepering
gang. At the inquest the abo. said:
“I know how old that pfeller track.
Morning twice that pfeller lie down
under tree. Sun come up he all time
shift round keep in shade. When sun
make shade twelve o’clock he jump up,
run away, fall down, finish.” The man
had left camp at ten in the morning ; he
lasted 26 hours. In 1923, on the Gas-
coyne (W.A.), a boundary-rider quitted
the station homestead and went bush.
With two abos. I picked him up five days
later alive. He recovered completely,
and went on with his job. Both
men had been seeing pink elephants.
A kangaroo-shooter in the same State
in 1929 left his mate at daylight
and died the same evening, 12 to
15 hours later. This chap was sober.
In all cases the weather was similar —
cloudless days and thermometer over 100
in the shade. None of them carried
water or had any.
THE ESSENTIAL THING.
“There’s lots of places yet,” said Joe, “I’ll say
are worth a try;
I sometimes wish I had the time to give them
all a fly.
But, after all is said and done, here is as good
as there,
For if a fellow’s luck is in he’ll find gold
anywhere.
“He’ll find a floater, say, as good as any man
could wish;
He’ll dolly it and get a tail of gold around the
• dish.
But if his luck is out he’d best have left the
thing alone,
Because he’ll never happen on the reef that
shed the stone.
“Or he’ll be learning up a hill and following
a trace,
Until he gets above the gold, and says, ‘Well,
here’s the place;
The lode can’t be too far away.’ But if he
hasn’t luck
He’ll never have a chance to talk about the
patch he struck.
“A man must have a bit of luck when he is
after gold—
A bit of luck to find a show, and some to get
it sold.
If luck is not among his kit he’d better drop
his tools
And leave the game of prospecting to other
hopeful fools.”

THE MAN ON
THE LAND
THE STUFF TO GIVE'EM
MEGGITTS LINSEED MEAL
SELLING THE CLIP.
“Albarmount”: If selling laws are
observed to the letter a grower with
several properties cannot have all his
wool sold at one issue, as stated by
“Small Woolgrower” (B. 16/1/’35). Cer-
tainly wool shorn in A zone should not
be used as the instalment for purposes
of cataloguing B-zone wool, A portion
of B-zone wool, however, is sold with
A-zone clips, and possibly the wool from
the property adjoining “S.W.G.” comes
within this quota.
There should be separate sales for
every distinct shearing. My sheep are
shorn in two sheds, and, though there is
only a fortnight between the shearings,
the second clip is sold five or six weeks
later than the first.
It would be impossible to sell each clip
in the order in which it is received, as
“S.W.G. 1 ’ suggests. The agents do this
as nearly as practicable, but the buying
side has to be catered for—hence the
inclusion of some B-zone clips with the
A-zone wool.
Tell “S.W.G.” that most selling agents
will advance on the clip, particularly after
they have it in the store.
NEW ENGLAND SHEEP.
“Square”: “Murrawong,” discussing
New England woolgrowing (B. 30/l/’35),
gives the impression that breeding ewes
are common to that area.
. Until recent years not more than 20
p.c. of New England sheep were ewes,
and, except in favored areas, they have
always had to battle through hard
seasons. Superfine and extra-super, wools
from northern N.S.W. have always been
held in high esteem by foreign buyers. It
is beautiful wool, although, until the
French perfected the combs, much of it
was bought as “clothing.” The finer
combing wools of the N.E. contest
supremacy with famous Yass clips.
Thousands of wethers come through
from Queensland every season off shears,
but it is questionable, even in times
of depressed wool prices, whether
young, robust sheep can be bought
at 10s. Of course, prices are in-
fluenced by well-understood factors —
for instance, the condition of the stock
routes. Even with wool at its present
price, so long as there is picking and
water holds out, Queensland woolgrowers
will not let good cutters go at a sacrifice.
Nobody wants drought sheep for New
England. An inspection of New Eng-
land catalogues over the years discloses
a big percentage of robust medium- to
strong-wool clips, and most of it came
from Queensland sheep off shears. New
England is a country of superfine wools,
but there is not much of it.
EXPORT LAMBS.
“W.D.Mc.”: E. O’Sullivan, of Spring
Plains, Mia Mia (Victoria), has had a
cable to say that three of his fat lambs
have been awarded first prize for export
lambs at Smithfield (Eng.).
They were placed only third at the
recent Royal Show, Melbourne, when
judged alive.
These lambs were bred on Spring
Plains, and were sired by Southdown
rams from Romney cross ewes. I have
always advocated Romney cross ewes for
breeding export lambs. My experience
has been that they make the best mothers
and rear their lambs well. Lambs from
Romney cross ewes by Southdown sires
are more uniform than from other
crosses. They also cut a good fleece of
useful wool, and are hardy and good
doers if they get a decent chance.
In Maoriland the Romney cross is
predominant for export, and the M.L.
sheepmen have made a success of the
job.
FAILING PASTURES.
“Sheepo”: Pessimists say lighter rain-
falls have reduced the carrying capacity
of our natural grass areas. The reasons
are further afield. Overstocking is con-
tributory, as also is the rushing back of
stock on to eaten-out pastures as soon
as the first rains come after a dry period.
Both have the effect of precluding the
young green grass shoots from getting
the unhampered start they need on the
way to maturity.
Protein extraction, rather than drought
effects, has reduced the feed value of
our natural grasses. Nitrogenous matter,
sapped from the pastures and exported
in wool, beef and mutton, must be re-
placed by artificial means as an essential
to health in stock, as well as to restore
the pastures. Top-dressing with the
minerals is hardly feasible or economic
on light-carrying country. Mineral licks
must be used to make up the extracted
rations, otherwise illness results.
Salt, lime and phosphorus are gener-
ally the minerals deficient in the stocked
pastures. The effects of the deficiency are
the greatest during dry spells and in the
winter.
Tests have proved that where a suit-
able mineral lick has been made avail-
able the weight of the fleece has im-
proved. A more important feature, how-
ever, is that lambing percentages have in-
creased, not only in the numbers marked,
but in the lambs that have survived, over
a dry spell.
A mineral-lick ration builds up the
condition of the ewes and helps to make
the extra milk supply needed.
SHEEP IN SNOW COUNTRY.
“Upilio”: It’s likely that the grass-
hoppers will clean me out, and should a
dry spell follow I intend to agist my
starvers on the N.S.W. sour-grass (snow-
lease) country where ’hoppers don’t go.
To-day, the wool market is not encourag-
ing, and doesn’t warrant much money
being spent in transport and agistment;
but the man who has kept his sheep alive
will come off best.
Sheep from western N.S.W. have to be
acclimatised before they will do any good
in the high country ; but they’ll live and
grow wool if they’re not overcrowded.
It is an error to think that agistment
country will carry five sheep to the acre
when they come off one- to five-acre
country. Shift the starvers by train
rather than risk long journeys by stock
routes. Either the grasshoppers or some-
one else are sure to have cleared the
track.
Many years when the grass-
hoppers ate me out in the Riverina, I in-
tended railing 3000 wethers via Cooma
to a Kiandra snow-lease where feed was
good. Agents and drovers dissuaded me,
maintaining that I would save money
and feed at the other end by walking
them via Tumut. Both had recently
been over the route and knew that it
was open. It was ; but the grasshoppers
had been there on the low country, and
I lost 18 p.c. of my sheep. At the same
time I trained 10,000 ewes from the Lach-
lan via Cooma to Nungar and back with
a loss of only 5 p.c.
During that period, a farmer at Temora
got stuck with 3000 merino ewes. He
decided to skin them. I bought the lot
at 3s. 6d. per head, fed them on and off
trucks with lucerne hay, and landed 2800
on grass at Crookwell. When it rained
a few months later, 2500 were mustered
and sold for 19s. per head. From experi-
ence, I would advise owners whose sheep
may face starvation from the ’hopper
plague to get in early on the high coun-
try, truck the sheep and stay with them
till the home pastures are right again.
CHINESE LOCUST CONTROL.
“G.H.H.”: From Genesis many nations
have been subject to famine through
locusts. The Chinese began to deal with
the pests in a.d. 627. By the seventeenth
century their measures were perfected on
principles laid down 900 years before.
The Governor of the district invaded,
his staff complete, and all residents were
gathered together. The insects were
hand-gathered by the multitude, who
were paid by results, women and child-
ren being remunerated in full. (This
method was suggested the other day by
a Victorian M.L.A.) The collections
made were destroyed by fire or boiling
water. Pits, sft. deep, were dug across
the track of the swarms, and burning
fires did noble work, whilst the laborer,
beating and sweeping with a great din,
thoroughly enjoyed himself.
When the locust had been cleared from
the district, the village elders had to hire
labor to gather and destroy eggs left
behind. Anybody ruined by the plagues
received a dole.
After centuries of training, the Chinee
now swats each locust as soon as seen.
CHEMICAL BRANDING.
“Beefo”: Chemicals for hide branding
were tried in Queensland years ago, but
proved unsatisfactory. Tests which I saw
left the brands blotched.
The most recent innovation, applied
with the ordinary branding iron, is said
to destroy the hair and produce a blister
on the skin which peels off in a fortnight
and leaves a clean mark. The process
does not impair the tanning value of the
hide.
Brand-plucking on horses is still an
art. The mutilation of chemically-
branded cattle would be simple for cattle-
stealers. -
Thousands of pounds are lost annu-
ally through fire-branding valuable hides.
Unless compelled by law, cattlemen
will not alter the present system ; but, if
it were compulsory to fire-brand on the
neck or low down on the shoulder or
the thigh, both breeders and tanners
would gain financially,
ST. JOHN’S WORT.
“Albarmount”: Except for its noxious
quality and tiny, golden-yellow flowers,
this plant is not unlike lucerne, and, being
perennial and deep-rooting, is difficult to
eradicate.
The seed is spread by travelling stock.
Hoeing increases its vigor, but stock
routes can be kept clean with coarse salt
around the roots. Sodium chlorate sprays
fail except on second and third applica-
tions.
The large seedbeds present the prob-
lem. Heavily stocking these will keep
the seeds down, but noxious properties
in the plant bring out irritating sores on
non-pigmented skins. There is a move-
ment afoot to have these areas fenced and
stocked with dark-pigmented animals —
black sheep and cattle.
BAITS V. BIRDS.
“A. 0,”: Poison baits at times are the
only way of dealing with a pest. With-
out this method rabbits and dingoes
would be nearly in possession of this
country now.
Insectivorous birds and other natural
enemies help to keep pests in check, but
are quite useless once the trouble
acquires plague dimensions. Rabbits,
grasshoppers, caterpillars and mice,
generally reach that stage after a boun-
teous year, when nature has provided
such abundant growth that the natural
enemies have no chance of keeping them
under.
Every sheepbreeding country in the
world suffers from the blowflies. Our
merinos are particularly attractive to
them, and our large flocks and holdings
make it difficult to deal with the pest
quickly.
The statement (B. 16/l/’35) that
“poison bait has wrought havoc with
Australian bird life” has been so often
made that men without practical experi-
ence accept it. My experience of 35
years with poison-carts is that it is a
very rare thing to poison a bird.
Severe droughts and closer settlement
have been responsible to a much greater
degree.
Where does this shortage of bird life
exist except in closer-settled districts?
In other districts it is probably more
plentiful than ever.
Anyway, why get panicky over grass-
hoppers? We have had many plagues
before. The earliest record I can find
of one was in 1852.
CONTROLLING EROSION.
“The 0.D.”: Surface erosion (B.
30/1 / ’35) is scarcely ever noticed on
open grazing country until extra-heavy
rain or a long, dry spell with high winds
discovers numerous depressions. Often
a landowner is losing useful soil, but
the process is so steady that he believes
the bare patches must have always been
there. In crop lands erosion can be
spotted quickly. The most profitable way
to check it is to sow plants like sub.
clover, Phalaris tuberose, Wimmera rye
and other strong-growing grasses.
Carefully managed, these will soon
mat over the land and hold the surface
soil, and will increase carrying capacity.
Where there are sharp slopes, contour
banks should be made. These may be
from 9in. to a foot high, should run as
nearly as possible across the slope, and
should be at parallel distances dictated
by the owner’s knowledge of the run-off
of water after rain. The object of the
banks should not be to dam the water,
but to check the flow, and if pasture
plants are sown on them all the better.
THE SKELETON IN THE PADDOCK.
“Valerin”: Favorable seasons and
neglect have given skeleton weed a hold
on thousands of acres of the best wheat
lands in Riverina and the N.S.W. south-
west slopes. In these parts I have
seen large areas of fallow and stubble
land covered by a growth of the pest so
thick that it is difficult to get machines
through it.
It is now in flower, and the winds are
spreading the seed over clean country.

CRAIG & AITKEN, 654 George Street, Sydney.
The farmers are trying to cope with it
by using discs and cultivators, but it is
a doubtful expedient, seeing that every
twig may becpfne a plant. Cost of treat-
ment makes the suggested remedies im-
practicable, so they have been discarded.
It is claimed that lucerne will choke
skeleton. I have reason to doubt it.
Last autumn I sowed with lucerne 200
acres of infested land. Germination was
good, but the weed is going to have the
better of the argument.
MAUL HEADS AND HANDLES.
“Booraby”: The main things in a good
maul are fitting the rings and boring for
the handle. To get a true circle, mark the
ends with the ring and. whittle down.
Heat the ring enough to expand the iron
(but don’t char the wood), and drive it on
till it is very little deeper than flush with
the wood. Then burr the edge of the
wood on to it by going round it with the
side of a cold chisel or small wedge.
In using a new maul reverse it frequently,
and work evenly round the head.
To bore for the handle sink the head
lengthwise in ground, measure the centre
with a rule and bore straight. A hole
slightly out of centre or not plumb makes
a bad tool.
Good woods for the head are blue-
gum and ironbark, cut from a limb, spur-
wood and woollybutt. Different timbers
are preferred in different localities, but
these are heavy, hard and durable. What-
ever the material, keep the maul always in
the shade when not in use.
The best wood for a handle is water-
gum cut from a log and whittled down.
It is light, tough and springy. But very
few splitters will whittle down a handle
for the maul, round sticks of the required
thickness being preferred. The best of
these are black myrtle, wild lime, spotted-
gum and garden quince. Insert the small
end of the handle at the back of the
head and drive it through.
A FARM-MACHINERY SEAT.
“Hope Vale”: A comfortable spring
seat for any agricultural implement can
be made of four old drill or similar coil
springs.
The seat is bolted to two pieces of
flat iron placed in the form of a cross
underneath. A hole is drilled in each
end of the iron. A similar frame is set
on the implement. Then four long bolts
are put through the top frame, the
springs slipped over the bolts and the
bolts then put through the holes in the
lower frame and nutted on. By adjust-
ing the nuts the seat can be raised or
lowered and tension of the springs
adapted to suit requirements.
WORMS IN HORSES.
“Mimosa”; The needle worm ( Ascaris )
and the long white worm (Lubricus teres )
are those most found in horses. Try as
a cure tartar emetic, from loz. to 2oz.
according to the size of patient, given
every morning in a little moistened
bran before the regular feed for six con-
secutive days, followed by an aloes ball.
During treatment give light and laxative
diet (bran and linseed mash), greenstuff,
carrots, etc. Continue treatment for 10
days. Then feed well.
LUBRICATION.
“Aerogenes”: Nothing illustrates
better the old saw about the “stitch in
time” than the application of the right
lubricant at the right time to farm machin-
ery. Care in the choice of oils or
greases will ensure the saving of the
most stitches.
It is an expensive practice to buy
cheap grades, lighter than needed, and
lacking body. Bearings get warm under
the load, and just when you want it most
the feeble stuff melts away.
It pays to be careful about leather
pump parts, gland packings, etc., such as
there are on milking machines. We once
spent pounds to replace air-pump leathers
which had been ruined by unsuitable
grease.
A separator must have good oil, care-
fully applied. Don’t splash a great deal
about the friction clutch of the power
drive, or it will slip and run unevenly.
Keep your eye on quality and quantity
in the sump. Some day you may find
that you have been running on milk and
water, that your spindle is rusty and
your crown-wheel grinding itself to
powder on the rusty worm.
Part of the art of lubricating lies in
knowing when not to lubricate. Places on
ploughs and other dirt shifters look as
if they need oiling, but they really should
be run dry. It is better to have the dirt
coming in and falling out again than to
have it mixing with oil or grease, and
making a grinding paste which cuts your
metal to bits.
HINTS FOR THE FARM.
“Marsh”; If sheepskins are to be
stored before being sent to market it will
be advisable to go carefully through them
from time to time. One painting with
an arsenical solution is not enough to
prevent weevil destruction. Go through
the skins every fortnight, and no harmful
effects will eventuate from another paint-
ing. Weevils are quick workers.
“Valerin”: If you don’t want to incur
the expense of covering the stack with
iron or thatch, keep the pitch of the
stack from eaves to ridge as steep as
possible, using the longest sheaves. Stretch
wire-netting over the roof as tightly as
possible. The ends can be secured to
pegs well driven into the body of the
stack. A wire run across the centre of
the netting makes the job secure. The
pressure of the netting makes the sheaves
solid and gives them a downward cant
which turns the wet and prevents the wind
blowing them about. Only a small por-
tion of the sheave butts will be stained
by rain.
“Upilio”; When boundary-riding I
never fill in a burrow that I find under
the netting. Instead, I catch the rabbit
there with a steel trap, which is left until
it remains undisturbed for a fortnight.
Rabbits that once root under a fence
never forget the trick unless destroyed.
“T.T.”: Broken pulley-belts can be re-
paired with woolbale-fasteners. Punch
holes in the belt, slip the pointed ends of
the fastener through and then flatten them
down.
“Timothy Tywire”: To prevent posts
in downs country lifting where the fence
crosses a depression, run a wire from the
bottom hole of the post on one side of
the dip, through the top hole of the post
in the centre to the bottom hole of the
post on the other side, passing it through
suitable holes in the intervening posts.
Strain tight. This prevents the posts
lifting when the other wires are strained
up.
“Karaway”; From grass-trees you can
make a good varnish for home use with
the resin-like gum from the trunks of the
trees. Pulverise it and mix to the usual
consistency with methylated spirit.
“Willeroo”: Clean sand is a good pre-
servative. Citrus fruits buried in it will
keep fresh for months. Carrots, parsnips
and swedes, which soon wither in the
open, can be kept fresh in the same way.
“8.A.J.”: Bore a lin. smooth hard-
wood board at foot intervals with a fin.
bit. Slit the lower ends of 4in. lengths
of rubber tubing, and for about Ifin.
diameter. Then pull them through the
holes, bend over the flaps made by the
slits and fasten them with tacks. With
the tubes uppermost, let the batten float
on the milk. The calves will do the rest.
Keep the board clean.
“Jaen Eille”: I don’t know about
bridle-breakers being incurable, but I
used to ride a brute who broke every
bridle put on him. My preventive was a
rope carried around his neck in the
manner of the Light Horse and field
artillery. Clove-hitched to a sapling, he’d
stand till he starved, but a fence never
beat him. He once took two com-
plete panels from a stout post-and-railer,
pulling the post to which he was tied
clean out of the ground.
“J.E.”: “Tarboy’s” par. about the
packing of Australian wool (B. 16/1/’35)
reminds me that our firm received a letter
from an agitated grower saying that he
had lost his best pipe during shearing.
His clip—ls bales—was already on the
rails. An intensive search failed to
restore the pipe, but it didn’t matter
much, for that was in the good old days
—his wool brought 28 pence.

THE SERENITY OF EMINENCE.
There was consternation in the general
office of Submerged Estates, Ltd. —the
cashier had bolted with the petty cash.
Miss Phast (“Ginger” to her intimates)
dashed into the Great Mogul’s sanctum,
and, forgetting in her excitement to fling
her arms about his neck and playfully
bite the lobe of his starboard ear, broke
the frightful news from the door.
“Darling,” she exclaimed, “Figurative’s
absconded with the till! What’ll we
book it to?”
The chief, as is characteristic of all
chiefs in a crisis, remained unmoved.
“Oh, put it down to running expenses,”
he said.

THIS WEEK’S GOLF STORY.
Justin Bunker, the golf champipn,
drove off and made one of his rare mis-
takes. The ball did not fly true. Instead,
it went out of bounds, across a road,
through the window of a house, knocked
over an oil lamp and set the place on fire.
Bunker pulled himself together. He
teed up again, drove another ball in the
direction of the town fire alarm, smashed
the glass and summoned the fire brigade.

SAFETY FIRST.
“Believing that a pea-rifle was not loaded,
Jack (17) put a hand over the end of the barrel
and pulled the trigger, and a bullet passed
through his hand.” —News item.
Jack was on the right track. The mis-
take he made was in putting his own
hand over the end of the barrel. The
easiest way to determine whether a gun
is loaded is to put a head over the end
of the barrel. Any head will do provided
it is not your own. If the head is still
intact after pulling the trigger then it
may be assumed that the rifle is not
loaded, and you can proceed at once to
load it. Keep on testing with heads until
you find ‘that the weapon has been
loaded. Then it will be time to reload.
THE WAY OF IT.
“How does a man usually propose?”
inquires someone in a Sydney paper.
Well, it usually happens like this.
Young Blobb gets what is undoubtedly
a glad-eye from a girl. He lifts his hat.
He is told that he is very bold ; the girl
was very nearly not going to take any
notice of his advances; but there is
something about him. Daphne—her
name is Daphne— always makes it a
rule to snub young men who try to be
fresh ; but something made her make an
exception in his case.
Blobb is flattered, both at being de-
scribed as bold and being made an ex-
ception. He really begins to think he
made the first advance.
A few nights later, sitting very close
to Daphne, he learns that Tom has told
her that he’ll do something desperate if
she doesn’t marry him.
“But I don’t think I want to marry
Tom,” says Daphne. “I have a feeling
“Hey, Bill! What sort o’ boots does the foreman wear?”
that he doesn’t love me—not in the same
way that you do.”
Blobb is alarmed ; but he doesn’t feel
up to saying that he doesn’t love her.
It becomes an accepted thing that he
loves Daphne in a way all his own.
Especially when he is introduced to
Daphne’s family.
“Daphne’s not going to marry for
ages yet —not if I can help it,” says her
mother decidedly. “A girl’s a fool to
get married till she has a bit of fun out
of life.”
Blobb feels relieved. He had started
expecting merely a bit of fun and is
alarmed at the quick approach of mar-
riage talk. But this’ll do him! No need
to be a nark and say he’s not thinking of
marrying—Daphne or anyone else.
“Well, Blobb, old boy, when’s it com-
ing off?” a friend asks bluffly, meeting
him in the bosom of the family.
“Well, Daphne doesn’t want to get
married for a long time; but Joe thinks
an early marriage is better,” says
Daphne’s mother quickly.
The only thing Blobb can think about
to jqstify that is that he said, unthink-
ingly, that he did not think a girl was a
fool to get married early. But by this
time he is in the toils; and before long
his wife is reproaching him because he
doesn’t tell her he loves her in the way
he used to do.

THE LUCKY MAN.
I have always held that success in
courtship is mainly a matter of luck.
Take my friend loom’s case.
He had nothing to recommend him to
Sylvia. She liked cavemen; and he
was a weedy, insignificant sufferer from
an inferiority complex. Nevertheless,
luck was on his side, and now they are
married.
It was like this. Visiting her one day
he proposed to her, and she had just
commenced to make some crushing reply
when her little brother, who was playing
cricket in the garden, hit the ball through
the open window. It struck her clean on
the jaw and knocked her cold.
loom spent the next 10 minutes trying
to revive her, and eventually she sat up
in a dazed condition.
She stared at him for a while, then,
flinging her arms around his neck, she
murmured: “I meant ‘Yes,’ my hero!”

PEEPS AT THE PROFESSIONS.
XXL —THE CRIMINAL.
“If you would leave the narrow track
To lead a life of crime —
A cheque to forge, a crib to crack —
Be warned by me in time.”
Thus spake the “lifer,” and a tear
He brushed from either eye :
“I’ve tried the lot, and now I’m here,
And will be till I die.
“Yes, crime would be a good career
If coppers didn’t interfere.”
The young man desirous of entering on
a life of crime should ponder the matter
seriously before taking the first step.
True, for the successful criminal the
rewards are great, but he should ask him-
self whether they are commensurate with
the effort demanded. He will meet with
little encouragement, all sorts of obstacles
will be put in his way by vested interests,
and even the police, whose duty it is to
assist all men of any profession whatso-
ever, will do their best to hamper him
in his efforts. It
is certainly a very
difficult profession
to break into.
Take burglary,
for example. No
one likes having
his house broken
into. But, on the
other hand, no
one likes having a
tooth out or a leg
amputated or a
score of other
things that people
submit to meekly
every day of the
week. Yet as soon
as a man finds
someone breaking
into his house he
raises blue murder,
and, if he is at all
athletic and has
the courage of his
convictions, then
the burglar is very
fortunate if he gets
away.
This persecution
of burglars has
been going on for
generations, but
such is the in-
domitable spirit of
the housebreaker
that there are still
men ready to take
up the glorious old
pro f e ssion, and
still women pre-
pared to watch
and wait far into
the small hours for the return of the
breadwinner with the night’s haul.
Then there is forgery. At school,
children are taught to copy beautiful
specimens of handwriting, and the one
who can make the most accurate copy
is praised above his fellows. Yet when
that same pupil reaches man’s estate and
tries to turn his accomplishment to some
useful purpose, he has all society against
him.
With pickpockets, cutpurses and shop-
lifters it is much the same. These men
display (unostentatiously, of course) a
sample of that kind of talent that makes
conjurors and jugglers rich. They are
modest, unassuming fellows, and seldom
boast about their performances. Yet
police and others are ever on the look-
out for them, and they spend half their
lives in prison, where through lack of
practice their fingers lose most of their
cunning, with the result that when they
come out they are so clumsy at the job
that they are soon back again.
Undoubtedly the best paying branch
of the profession is that of Master
Criminal, who
commits all his
crimes by proxy,
stands his trial by
proxy and serves
his sentences by
proxy. He has ex-
perts in every
branch of crime
working for him,
and the only thing
he doesn’t do by
proxy is collect the
profits of his under-
takings. He is un-
known to the
police, and none of
his thousands of
hirelings ever sees
him. So mysterious
is he that he is
often not sure
whether he is him-
self. In fact, it is
doubtful whether
he exists at all.
It will be realised
that one cannot
take on this role to
begin with. One
must first have
gained experience
in all branches of
crime, with the
attendant risk and
persecution.
On the whole,
therefore, the
would-be criminal will be well advised
not to take on burglary, forgery, pocket-
picking, arson, garrotting, bigamy, infan-
ticide or any of the lesser branches of the
profession. The risk is too great and
the reward too small.
Far better for him to try his hand at
the promotion of bogus companies. It
is not only highly remunerative, but also
safe.

Information Sought.
(1) Is it permissible to use a new ball for the
second innings of a cricket match when the
first-innings score is under 200 runs ? (2) A
batsman grounding his bat behind the batting
crease jumped to avoid the ball , which a fields-
man had thrown in. The ball hit the wicket
while the batsman was in the air. Was he
out ?— 5380.
The Law of Cricket No. 4 states that at the
beginning of each innings either side may de-
mand a new ball. (2) Covered by Law 28.
Unless some part of the batsman’s person or
his bat in hand is grounded within the crease
the batsman is run out.
(1) Can a married man leave the Common-
wealth without the~ consent of his wife ? (2)
Should she refuse her permission, is this final,
or can the husband appeal to any authority for
a passport to be issued ? —5473.
(1) Yes, in certain circumstances. (2) Where
a married man applies for a passport to enable
him to proceed abroad unaccompanied by his
wife, it is customary to ask him to produce
some documentary evidence that his wife knows
all about it. Where this is not forthcoming, or
where a wife objects, the case would be dealt
with by the Minister for the Interior on its
merits.
(1) Names of companies building aircraft in
Great Britain ? (2) Do certain companies build
only for the Royal Air Force ? (3) Is the
piston-inside-piston valve system reckoned to
cut down the ratio in size and weight, also
giving more power and less fuel consumption ?
(4) Is the De Havilland Comet powered with
that type? —5311.
(1) Can’t spare space for a directory. Some
important ones are known shortly as Hawker,
Fairey, Short, Vickers, Armstrong-Siddeley,
Bristol, Westland, Supermarine, Blackburn and
De Havilland. (2), (3) and (4) No.
Particulars concerning the first British stream-
lined express ? —5439.
The first British streamlined express car
travelled from London to Birmingham and
thence, to Cardiff. The car, which was driven
by twin 130-h.p. oil engines, left Paddington
at 9.10 a.m., arrived at Birmingham at 11.8,
and, after a stay of five minutes, went to Car-
diff via Gloucester and Newport, completing
its journey at 1.38 p.m., two minutes ahead
of schedule. An average speed of 54.8 m.p.h.
was maintained, and at one point a speed of
73.2 m.p.h. was attained.
Can you tell me anything about non-reflect-
ing windows, a British invention ? —5427.
Such windows are made concave, so framed
that the light from all sources which falls on
them is reflected to blackboards arranged one
at the top and the other at the bottom of the
glass. The eye of the observer in front of the
window is unaffected by reflected light, so that
it is difficult to believe that there is any
glass between the observer and the objects
displayed. The principle can also be applied
to the glazing of pictures and museum cases.
What is the world’s production of artificial
silk—total and according to countries ? —3408.
Total production is about 300,000 tons p.a.
Chief producers are: U.S.A. 93,000 tons,
Japan 44,000 tons, United Kingdom 38,000
tons, Italy 37,000 tons, Germany 30,000 tons
and France 25,000 tons p.a.

(1) Should a hall in N.S.W. used for public
entertainment be registered ? (2) Have any
special steps to be taken to guard, against fire ?
(3) Where could 1 obtain information regarding
payment of entertainment tax ? —5382.
(1) It should be licensed. Any person holding
a public entertainment or public meeting in a
non-licensed building of a permanent character
is liable to a penalty of £50 for every day
during which entertainment or meeting is held.
If held by a firm, the firm’s name should be
egistered. (2) Means of escape such as exit
Joors must be provided. Other precautions are
.equired, for which you should consult the
local fire authority. (3) Taxation Dept., Savings

year-old Dutchman; acquittal for Ernst Tongler,
German Communist, and acquittal for Dimit-
roff, Taheff and Popoff, Bulgarian Communists.

army.” (4) “God bless you, my dear.” (5)
Asked if his mind was at peace, Goldsmith
replied, “No, it is not!” (6) “More light, more

She doth tell me where to borrow
Comfort in the midst of sorrow;
Makes the desolatest place,
To her presence be a grace ? •
—5456.
George Wither (1588-1667), in “The Shep-
herd’s Hunting.”
In what song or poem do these lines
occur?
Oh! there are looks and tones that dart
An instant sunshine thro’ the heart,
As if the soul that minute caught
Somet treasure it thro’ life had sought.
—5363.
In “Lalla Rookh,” by Tom Moore.
In a book on Ireland by Darrell Figgis refer-
ence is made to Ribbonism. What is it ?
5331..
Refers to the tenets of the Ribbon Society,
a secret organisation formed in Ireland in
1808. Its object was to prevent landlords evict-
ing tenants. The society threatened with death
any tenant who took land from which another
tenant had been evicted. . *• .
(1) What was the Quipu method of writing ?
(2) Where can I find a full account ? —5529.
(1) Quipu (a Peruvian word meaning knot)
was a cord spun from colored threads to form
a fringe which served among the ancient Peru-
vians as a method of communication and
record. There was a stout main cord (Ift. to
syds. or 6yds. long), to which branch cords
of various colors were fastened at irregular
intervals. The number, size, position, distance
apart and color of the knots all had particular
significance. (2) Tylor’s “Early History of
Mankind.”
Details concerning a contrivance invented
during the Great War as a protection for ships
from mines ? It was towed under water. —
5338.
Presume that you refer to the paravane, a
contrivance developed by Commander Usborn
and Lieut, (now Sir Dennistoun) Burney. It
consists of a cigar-shaped body made of a
welded steel plate. At its nose end it carries
an eye for a towing-cable, a fixed cutter for
severing the moorings of a mine and a small
steel plane for stability. At the tail end are
two rudders actuated by a hydrostatic valve
which controls the depth at which the paravane
runs; also small horizontal and vertical fins. A
paravane is towed on each side of a ship by
steel ropes attached to the stem, and is
adjusted to run submerged slightly below the
level of the keel, about 50ft. from the ship’s
side and about 180 ft. from the stem, depend-
ing on the length of the vessel. The towing-
cable thus forms a wedge which, when it comes
in contact with the mine mooring-wire, deflects
the latter away from the ship and leads it to
the cutter on the paravane, where it is severed,
thus permitting the released mine to rise to the
surface, when it can be destroyed. There is no
danger of a ship registering a direct hit on a
mine, for the cushion of water in front of
her stem deflects any movable object to one
side or the other. There is another type of
paravane which contains explosives, and is used
to destroy submarines whose positions are
approximately known. It is towed at high speed
behind the attacking vessel, and the charge can
be fired by electricity or automatically, by
detonator, when the paravane strikes its target.
I wish to obtain an electrician’s license in
order to do my own wiring. How do I obtain
this ? —5183.
Electricians’ licenses are issued by the Elec-
trical Contractors and Electricians Licensing
Board, whose address is Box 1488 DD, G.P.0.,
Sydney. Applicants are required to have had
a satisfactory practical experience in the elec-
trical trade. Full particulars of practical ex-
perience should be furnished direct to the board.
(1) What are the ingredients used in Aus-
tralia in the brewing of beer? (2) What are
the chemicals used, and which are injurious to
health if excess quantities are used? (3) Are
brewers liable to be proceeded against for
selling beer containing chemicals not allowed,
or using chemicals in excess of the amount
allowed ? (4) Have any prosecutions been in-
stitutea for breaches of the law in respect of
manufacture of beer in Australia? (5) Is
beer manufactured from grain only superior
10 , that manufactured from grain and chemi-
cals ? —5370.
0) As specified in the Pure Foods Acts of
all Australian States, “malted or other grain
and sugar and/or glucose with hops and/or
other harmless vegetable bitters.” Whilst other
grains have been used, practically every licensed
brewery in Australia brews from barley malt, or
malt and sugar, with hops and water. Their
operations and the materials used are super-
vised by the Commonwealth Excise Depart-
ment. (2) No “chemicals” whatever, as com-
monly understood, enter into the constituents
of beer sold by holders of licenses. Certain
preservatives (sulphur dioxide or benzoic acid),
however, are permitted, in quantities less than
half of those allowed for non-intoxicating bever-
ages and certain foodstuffs. The use of these
is confined to bulk beer, pasteurisation being
relied upon for the sterilisation of bottled beers.
(3) Yes. (4) Yes; for excess of salicylic acid,
when this was permitted as a preservative, prior
to 1932. (5) Comparison is not possible, as
there is no known beer brewed from grain and
chemicals.
What is the origin of the office of Poet
Laureate of England ? Who have held the
office ? —5440.
No authentic record of origin. According
to Warton, there was a Versificator Regis, or
King’s Poet, in the reign of Henry 111. (1216-
1272), and he was paid 100 shillings a year.
Geoffrey Chaucer (1328-1400) assumed the title
of Poet Laureate, and in 1389 got a royal
grant of a yearly allowance of wine. In the
reign of Edward IV. (1461-1483) John Kay
held the post. Under Henry VII. (1485-1509)
Andrew Bernard was the Poet Laureate, and
was succeeded under Henry VIII. (1509-1547)
by John Skelton. Next came Edmund Spenser,
Samuel Daniel, Ben Jonson, Sir William Daven-
ant and John Dryden. The others, with
the date of appointment, when known,
have been: Thomas Shadwell 1689, Nahum
Tate 1692, Nicholas Rowe 1715, the Rev.
Laurence Eusden 1718, Colley Cibber 1730,
William Whitehead 1758 (on the refusal of
Gray), Rev. Thomas Warton 1785 (on the re-
fusal of Mason), Harry J. Pye 1790, Robert
Southey 1819 (on the refusal of Sir Walter
Scott), William Wordsworth 1843, Alfred Tenny-
son 1850, Alfred Austin 1896, Robert Bridges
1913 and John Masefield 1930.
How to keep cabinets used for preserving
butterflies free from mould ? —5310.
Cabinets should be kept in a dry and airy
position. At the first sign of mould the box
should be opened and dried carefully before
a fire till all moisture has evaporated; the
mould can then be dusted off with a camel-
hair brush. A piece of cotton-wool soaked in
a 10-p.c. solution of carbolic and placed
in a corner of the store box will help to
prevent the growth of mould. Powdered naph-
thalene or paradichlorbenzine should be kept
in every box to exclude mites and other pests.
From time to time all boxes should be fumi-
gated with a wad of cotton-wool soaked in
carbon bisulphide or carbon tetrachloride.
Can you tell me something about Christophe
Plantin, an early French printer? —ss23.
He was born at St. Avertin, near Tours, in
1514, and in 1555 set up at Antwerp one of the
largest printing houses in Europe. His works
were famous for their accuracy and beautiful
workmanship, and he secured many influential
patrons. The most noted of his publications is
the “Biblia Polyglotta” (eight vols., 1658-73).
He also set up printing houses in Leyden and
Paris, carried on by his sons-in-law. In 1876
the Antwerp house was purchased by the city
and opened as The Muses Plantin.
(1) What market is there in Australia for
serial stories ? (2) What does a first-class news-
paper in Australia pay for first serial rights
for a 60,000-word story by an unknown writer ?
(3) Minimum amount an unknown writer should
accept ? (4) What facilities are there for in-
struction in this branch of authorship ? (5) A
few books dealing with the technique of serial-
writing ?• —5384.
(1) A fair market. For a full list of papers
accepting serials and their requirements, rates
of pay, etc., see the “Australian Authors and
Artists’ Handbook” (2s. 6d.). (2) £25 to £SO.
(3) Not less than £25. (4) Practically none.
(5) “How to Write Serial Fiction,” by Michael
Joseph (3s. 6d.).
In music, is it considered bad form to play
songs, etc., in octaves (piano), always provided
the executant has good octave technique ? If
the melody is good, would it show a lack of
harmony to a pronounced degree ? —5423.
If the reference is to song accompaniments,
there is no rule against the employment of
octaves. Large portions of the accompani-
ment of Schubert’s “Erl King,” for example, are
in octaves. An octave, being two notes in
unison, cannot affect harmony. But it is a good
rule to play octaves only where the com-
poser put them.
How many different brands can be registered
to contain two letters of the alphabet and one
Arabic numeral in any order, and how is it
worked out ? —5413.
A number of possible combinations of 26
letters taken two at a time is 26 multiplied
by 25 and divided by two, totalling 325. Each
of these combinations can be arranged in two
ways, making 650. Each of these 650 arrange-
ments can go with one of 10 numerals,
making 6500, and, as the numeral can go in
front, at the end or between the letters, there
are two more sets of 6500, making 19,500
in all.
Particulars of the disease called myxcedema ?
—5454.
It is a metabolic disease caused by dis-
turbance of the function of the thyroid gland.
This gland, which lies in front of the wind-
pipe, is one of the so-called ductless glands.
Its functions are not definitely known, but it is
thought that its secretion aids metabolism either
by counteracting poisons or by aiding in the
absorption of proteid matter. If the gland be
removed by operation a state of sluggish meta-
bolism sets in, with depression of mental func-
tion. The body increases in bulk, and the
subcutaneous tissue of the face and hands be-
comes infiltrated with a mucin-like substance,
causing a swelling which does not pit on
pressure. The mental processes become slug-
gish, the speech becomes halting, and there
is a marked loss of mental and physical energy.
One of the characteristic symptoms is a total
absence of sweating. The disease may run its
course for many years, with gradually increas-
ing intellectual and physical incapacity. The
connection of the disease with the loss of
activity of the thyroid gland is demonstrated by
the similarity of the symptoms to those of
operative myxcedema, the existence of cases
in which the thyroid gland is shown to be
atrophied, and the fact that administration of
thyroid extract causes a marked amelioration of
symptoms.

Windsor Branch of the Bank of New South Wales, 185S-193S w
In Old Windsor
Windsor, 34 miles from Sydney by rail, is
one of the oldest towns in Australia.
Originally known as Greenhills, the first
settlement there was about 1794. As late as
1858 Windsor was considered to be the
fourth largest town in New South Wales.
For the first 25 or 30 years the Windsor dis-
trict was the granary of the colony
The Bank of New South Wales opened its
branch there in 1858 in the premises illus-
trated above. This building, which is still
occupied by the Bank, is a fine example of
early colonial architecture.
Since then the Bank has opened over 700
branches throughout Australia, New Zea-
land and the Pacific Islands.
It is the oldest and largest Bank in Aus-
tralasia and has always maintained its
position as the leading banking institution
in the Southern Hemisphere.

FROM CHINA TO PERU.
“Hotham”: The Australian tennis
heads have refused a proposal that Mrs.
Westacott and Joan Hartigan should
be sent to Wimbledon, or that the players
should at least receive a subsidy. Miss
Hartigan is going, anyway, but it is a
pity the Queenslander cannot accompany
her. In addition to being a sensational
player when in form, the lady’s kanga-
roo-like activities would be a big hit at
Wimbledon, which has grown stodgy
since the Lenglen became a professional.

“Canny Lad”: No need to bewail the
unchivalrous practice of the Belfast G. C.
(B. 23 /1 / ’35) in making their associate
members enter the clubhouse by a side
door. St. Andrews allows no women at
all on the premises except the domestic
staff and the secretary’s typist. The rule
is relaxed only on the two medal days
of the year ; then, at the close of the day,
members are allowed to take lady friends
over certain portions of the clubhouse.
This indulgence lasts an hour, and then
the hens are ruthlessly shooed out.

ber for Gorbals, on the Prime Minister

“Springhaans”: According to a Sal-
vation Army man who has come to
Australia after years in S’Africa, the
Union spends an average of a million a
year combating the locust, instead of
ostriching and leaving the job to the
Provinces, which correspond to our
States. He says the great harborage of
the locust wherein eggs are laid and
hatch undisturbed are the fenced-off
strips on each side of railway lines. So
great has been the outcry against these
breeding grounds that the Government
now periodically runs trains equipped
with flame-throwing apparatus which
covers the ground 40ft. on each side of
the line. Except for the penitent em-
ployment of flame-throwers, it is the old
story of pest-breeding Government-con-
trolled lands with which Australia is
only too familiar.

“G.M.”: That French Judge who
described Colonel Caillon, shot by a cap-
tain in the North African desert, as one
who regarded officers’ wives as love-dolls,
has given a new word to the language—
or all languages. The “love-doll” will
soon appear in the headlines of every
American newspaper and, later, of every
English and Australian paper. What is
the betting that Hollywood and Elstree
are now racing already to turn out a film
with the alluring box-office title of “The
Love Doll”? There’s a million dahlars
in it,

“G. Trotter”: Again complaints are
rising from Victorian irrigated areas re-
garding the loss of water through seep-
age in the channels. Immense wastage
must be expected when the water trickles
through soil so soft and porous as to be
good agriculturally. Californian irriga-|
tion areas have long abandoned the idea
of open channels. Practically every
settlement opened up during the last 20
years is reticulated by pipe-lines like a
city water supply. This conserves the
water until it reaches the actual area
where it is used, and has the additional
advantage of making the whole scheme
independent of gravitation. Many of the
irrigated farms there are on undulating
land, and the pipes simply follow the con-
tour of the country. Dependent on gravi-
tation, half California’s area would not
be under irrigation to-day.

HUDSON “EIGHT” PUT THROUGH
ITS PACES.
ROADWORTHINESS AND PHENOMENAL ACCELERATION
DISTINCTIVE FEATURES.
BY FRED BERRY.
' I ’RUTHFULLY it can be said that racing improves the breed
of automobiles, whatever it does to horses. The racing
car of to-day is the touring car of the near future. So the
Hudson Terraplane group, having to its credit 72 stock-car
records, duly certified by the American Automobile Association,
would be expected to build a car snappy in road performance,
in which faults in design had been eliminated by reason of
tremendous punishment of both mechanism and structure in the
process of record breaking.
Students of motoring have long since
realised that extraordinary road perform-
ance is not achieved by guesswork, but
rather by study of every constructional
feature calculated to improve power-
weight ratio. In any modern design it
will be found that the car with greatest
available horse-power for each hundred
pounds of gross weight will show the
better road performance, but where the
Hudson Terraplane is outstanding lies
in the fact that, while possessing a power-
weight ratio that would not be out of
place in a racing car, every effort has
been made to ensure that chassis, body-
work and transmission will stand up to
road conditions.
The exterior of the new Hudson is
pleasing, the clean, streamlined profile
promising, in addition to speed, a mini-
mum of trouble in maintaining smart
appearance.
Racy, Yet Roomy.
Though the new type is racy in aspect,
the first impression given on opening
any door in closed models is that they
are roomy, and this is borne out by actual
measurement of both driver’s and pas-
sengers’, compartments. Internal equip-
ment is neatly carried out, while the

instrument board is fitted with aero-
plane-type dials and meters, grouped in
one half directly in front of the steering-
wheel, the other half housing a useful
package-locker with a door. Comfort,
so far as the driver is concerned, is
assured by sliding front seats and the
steering-pillar being adjustable to five
different positions.
Windows on both sides of driver’s
compartment and in the rear quarters of
sedans are fitted with individually-con-
trolled ventilation, permitting entry of
fresh air without inducing draughts, and,
in order to further carry out the “rear-
end” streamlining effect, a cleverly-con-
cealed luggage compartment is provided
in the rear panel complete with anti-thief
locking handle.
Optional Ratios.
Hudson engines, whilst fundamentally
identical, are fitted with cylinder heads of
various design to fulfil the requirements
of discriminating buyers. With 5.75-to-l
ratio max. h.p. is 108. Fitting a 6.25-to-l
head raises the effective power to 113,
whilst, with the “power dome” giving
a 7-to-l ratio, maximum output at 3800
r.p.m. is 121 h.p. Incidentally, the
power-dome head is of composite con-
struction, both cast-iron and aluminium
alloy, separated by special gaskets, being
employed.
The cylinder block is of special high-
chrome alloy, enabling the cylinder bores
to be ground to a glass-hard sur-
face. Connecting rods are drop-forged,
and the crankshaft, balanced statically
and dynamically, incorporates counter-
weights forged integral with the shaft,
insuring extreme smoothness in running.
Side-by-side valves of large diameter
are used, providing free flow of gases
to combustion chamber without undue
lift. Fuel is drawn by automatic pump
from a 14-gallon tank housed at the rear
of the chassis through an efficient filter,
and fed to a down-draught type carburet-
tor equipped with air-cleaner, silencer
and flame-arrestor.
Automatic Control,
The induction system is provided with
automatic choke control governed by
engine temperature. As exhaust gases
heat up a hot-spot on the intake manifold
a thermostat closes the choke mechanism.
No manual control is fitted, and the care-
less or thoughtless driver no longer
suffers the penalty of excessive crank-
case dilution.
Lubrication is by the Duo-flow sys-
tem, employing a mechanical pump of
large capacity. By this method not only
does the flow of oil provide a tremen-
dous overcapacity for purposes of lubri-
cation, but it has a marked cooling effect
on the bearings throughout the motor.
Furthermore, the oil flows instantly on
the first turn of
the crankshaft
to cylinder walls
and bearings, so
eliminating all
risks of seizure
or excessive
wear of cylinder
bores on start-
ing up from
cold.
Full auto-
matic ignition is
fitted, spark
plugs are metric-
threaded, and
battery is 120-
ampere -hour
capacity with 19
plates. The
heavy-duty gen-
erator has been
designed parti-
cularly for high
road speeds, to-
gether with the
possible add i-
tional drain im-
posed by added
electrical de-
vices, including
radio. An in-
built fan pre-

thermostat, and the water-level indicator
is fitted in the instrument panel.
The engine is mounted in the chassis
at three points on rubber cushions which,
when drawn into place by the central
bolt, compress air within hollow cham-
bers in the mounting. In effect, this pro-
vides a compressed-air mounting which
is claimed to absorb shock and insulate
against sound.
Transmission is through a new type
clutch, with forged-steel pressure plate
and heat-treated cork insets. Running in
oil, this type of clutch provides smooth
action, long life and freedom from up-
keep expenses.
The gearbox, in unit with the motor,
has three forward speeds and reverse.
Pinions are constant-mesh helical-cut
type and an automatic control, throwing
low and reverse pinions out of mesh
whilst driving in second or high gears, is
fitted.
The propeller shaft is fitted with
needle-bearing universal joints front and
rear. Rear-axle housing is banjo type.
Rear axles are semi-floating. Final drive
is spiral-bevelled, with reduction gear of
4 1-9 to 1.
Chassis is rigid box-girder type with
X-member in centre and K-member
front. The entire structure of frame is
further stiffened by a heavy steel plate
forming the complete floor of the body,
so ensuring rigidity and resistance to
tortional stresses. An independent sub-
frame is used as a support for the motor.
Splayed Rear Springs.
Semi-elliptic springs are characteristic
of Hudson Terraplane practice, being
splayed at the rear, while as a further
assurance of comfort and roadworthiness
conventional type shock-absorbers are
replaced with telescopic type, direct-thrust
“road levellers,” which operate hydrauli-
cally against a cushion of oil. Anchor-
ages are bushed with compressed rubber.
“Front end” suspension, whilst retain-
ing conventional scrub-elliptic springs, in-
corporates axle flex independent suspen-
sion. Here the split or articulated front
axle (interchangeable with conventional
axles) accomplishes independent front-
wheel suspension through two heat-
treated forged links in the centre of the
axle beam between the spring seats.
Correct wheel camber is retained during
vertical movement of either wheel. Auto-
matic banking is assured on corners, and
very little weight is added to the car.
Brakes are of the self-energising mechani-
cal type on all four wheels, while steering
is worm and sector type with a reduc-
tion ratio of 15 to 1.
The car tested over The Bulletin
course was a stock model demonstrator
fitted with a power dome, combustion
chamber, 7-to-l compression ratio and
driven by L. Tyson, of Dalgetys, Ltd.,
N.S.W. distributors.
With driver and observer and full fuel
tank, weighbridge docket showed 321 cwt.,
whilst speedometer reading stood at 7672
miles, giving an assurance that motor and
transmission mechanism had been thor-
oughly “run in.”
Passing through city traffic on the way
to Parramatta the Hudson gave one the
impression of tremendous power. The
slightest pressure of the acceleration
pedal caused the car to accelerate in top
gear in a most satisfying manner.
High Cruising Speeds.
Leaving Parramatta and on the open
country roads through Baulkham Hills
the Hudson toured at any desired speed
between 20 and 70 m.p.h. without effort,
and it was demonstrated that in the
hands of a skilful driver phenomenal
average road speeds are possible.
Approaching Windsor speed was re-
duced to 15 m.p.h. for the rolling- test.

to rest, certain proof of perfect align-

Continuing towards Richmond a test
of maximum speed was made over a
surveyed mile, and from a flying start the
Hudson clocked 42 2-ssec., averaging
84.9 m.p.h. Over this section the motor
was quiet and free from vibration, whilst
the car held the road splendidly.

The modern car develops extremely high tempera-

FIRST FOR PERFORMANCE AND ECONOMY
VACUUM OIL COMPANY PTY. LTD.
(INCORPORATED IN AUSTRALIA)
pass via Grose Vale was taken in order
to test the car under country conditions.
The Hudson passed this test without diffi-
culty, and with 2 1-5 miles to go to the
summit of Kurrajong a standing-start
speed climb was made against the watch.
Time registered, 3min. 3 4-ssec., gives
some indication of the car’s power and
roadworthiness. During the climb cor-
nering was safe and steady, whilst on the
straight sections in second gear the speed-
ome t e r whirled
around to between
60 and 70 without
fuss, and the finish-
ing line on the
steepest grade was
crossed at 50
m.p.h.
Returning down
the mountain, a
test of emergency-
braking equipment
was made with
satisfactory results,
as would be ex-
pected, as the hand
lever by indepen-
dent linkage actu-
ates service brakes
on all four wheels.
Appro aching
Richmond the
cross-country road
via Castlereagh to
Penrith was taken,
and here further
performance tests
were made. Slow
running in top gear for one-fifth
of a mile, followed immediately by
a similar distance on full throttle,
gave the following times: Slow run-
ning, 2min. 25sec. ; average speed, 4.9
m.p.h. Accelerated section, 15sec., cross-
ing the finishing line at 65 m.p.h. and
averaging 48 m.p.h. Acceleration from
10 to 30 m.p.h. in top gear was clocked
in 6 3-ssec., while in second gear time
taken was 4 l-ssec. From a standing
start to 50 m.p.h. through all gears the
time was 9.4-5 seconds. These times are
remarkable, and even two years ago
would have been thought impossible.
Brakes and Steering.
Tests were then made of braking
equipment and steering lock. From a
speed of 25 m.p.h. the car came to rest in
27ft. 6in., whilst left and right steering
locks both measured 41ft. Minimum
ground clearance was found to be B|in.
Petrol consumed on the journey of 117
miles was 5 gallons 6 pints, giving an
average petrol consumption of 20.3
m.p.g. (32.9 ton-miles), and as the time
taken for the journey, inclusive of all
tests, was 3 hours 15 minutes, average
speed showed 36 m.p.h.
When Sump Oil Should be Changed.
Motorists, particularly those who have
not bought a new model,* often wish to
know how much oil their engines ought
to use. The oil consumed by different
makes of engines varies considerably, but
in most modern cars averages less than
one gallon to 1000 miles. This does not
mean that one gallon is actually used up,
since many well-conditioned engines show
hardly any direct consumption of oil
at all. Nevertheless, the oil has been
used for lubrication, and will have lost
some of its lubricating qualities.
After oil has been in use for some
time it is mixed with water, carbon, road
dust, liquid fuel and minute particles of
metal. These substances coagulate and
form what is known as crankcase sludge.
New-type carburettor in Hudson “Eight” provides automatic
choke control, automatic idling speed and automatic choke,
while ignition is advanced or retarded automatically in
keeping with road speed.
This sludge can best be described as
something between tar and thick black
mud, and it must be regularly cleared
out. After 1000 to 1500 miles, the sump
should be drained and filled with fresh
oil. It is best to do this after a run, as
the oil is then warm and thin and will
run out more easily. Having drained the
oil out, it is necessary to remove the
sludge. Various opinions exist as to the
best method, some using kerosene as a
washout; but this method is not recom-
mended, since it is seldom possible en-
tirely to drain the sump, and a little kero-
sene may be left behind to dilute the
new oil immediately it is put in and so
impair its lubricating powers.
New Bearing Metals Prolong Engine
Life.
The old complaint of motorists about
a burnt-out bearing may soon be a
thing of the past. Following extended
research and progress in metallurgy, new
varieties of bearing metals have been
developed that
promise to wipe out
engine failure from
this cause.
Science has found
a substitute for the
familiar white metal.
For years engineers
have been working
with copper-lead
and other com-
pounds, and now
they have brought
them into practical
use. It is reported
that four makers —
Packard, Ford,
General Motors and
Studebaker—are using the new metals
for engines now in production, and it is
predicted that during 1935 nearly all
automobile manufacturers in U.S.A. will
follow suit.
The change to the new bearing metal
is along the lines of general engine im-
provement that has had to be made to
keep up with the development of greater
power and high speed, and engineering
opinion is that copper-lead bearings will
simplify the job of adding more horse-
power and speed to present power
plants ; also, they will allow the use of
narrower bearings, and thereby reduce
engines to more compact sizes, besides
paving the way for multiple cylinder “in
line” engines for low-priced cars.
Motor Oddities.
“Shiggs”: The Vic. floods left many
patches of roadway with a cement-like
surface in appearance, but a real trap in
actual fact. A driver sailed on to one of
these patches, and his car went down to
the running-boards. Unable even to
move it, he went for help. The farm-
house where he called had been visited
by plenty of water, which had put the
only motor vehicle out of action. A
garage in town was called up, and sent
out a car. At a wrong moment, the
brakes wouldn’t hold and the rescuing
vehicle joined the other car in the bog.

Powlathanga, about 20 miles west of the
Towers on the main road, there were five
gates in a cluster. As about half of
them were railway gates and the others
were so close to houses that a man
couldn’t leave ’em open with impunity,
they just had to be shut. That was where
the Powlathanga Kids played their part.
There were a dozen or more of these,
from several families, and they rushed
the gates at the approach of a car. They
were adepts in the art of slowing a car
down, and they never missed a sixpence
thrown in the dust. Then one day a dirty
dog passed a brummy florin on ’em! I
had the bad luck to follow that rooster.
Those gates were scientifically lifted
from their hinges and tied with all
manner of weird devices, and it took
me the best part of an hour to fix ’em
while grinning faces peered round cor-
ners and through cracks of half-opened
doors. I suppose that batch of young-
sters is all grown up now and scattered ;
but if there is anything in heredity there
is still aid for the motorist at Powla-
thanga Gates.

“B.Sc.”: On the way home from town
Lizzie the lorry developed a dirty spark-

remedy the defect his exclamation
brought me to the opened bonnet. There,
squeezed in against the exhaust-pipe, very
hot and rather greasy, was a rabbit kitten.
The lorry had travelled 12 miles that
morning, and had been standing in a
yard frequented by dogs, cats and pigs,
so bunny must have sought refuge, and
performed his scrambling feat during the
night, getting in under the radiator or
over the pedals. As a reward for his

The Trouble Lamp.
G.N.S. (Wollongong, N.S.W.). —My 1927 car,
purchased second-hand, has run 70,000 miles,
and I desire to renew the oil and clean out
sludge from differential housing. Must I dis-
mantle the back axle to do this, for the only
draincock is one for checking up oil level ?
Fill the housing with kerosene, spin the gear
for a few minutes with wheels jacked up, and
then suck out the oil with a syringe, slipping
a length of rubber gas tubing over the nozzle.
Better still, take the car to a garage and have
a |in. hole drilled in the bottom of the casing
and a grub screw fitted. Draining will then be
a simple process.
A.McH. (Healesville, Vic.). —Recently my car
has given trouble by boiling on steep grades.
Have noticed that radiator is cooler at bottom
than top. Cause and cure ?
Every radiator is cooler at the bottom. Check
valve timing, ignition point, valve clearances
and fan-belt tension.
J.S.S. (Sydney). —Have driven 3000 to 4000
miles in my new car, mostly in the city.
(1) How can I start on an up-grade after being
blocked in traffic without using the hand
brake ? (2) When I stop after a sufficient run
to make the engine hot the engine almost in-
variably stalls, and in whatever position I place
the choke control the engine still appears stub-
born—a most embarrassing situation in traffic.
What’s wrong ?
(1) Drivers who get away from a standing
start on a grade without using the hand brake
are “riding the clutch” — i.e., they keep the
engine turning over at a fair speed and hold
the car stationary by delicate clutch control.
This practice, whilst effective, imposes undue
wear on the clutch face and withdrawal
mechanism. No great damage is occasioned
when single-plate clutches are fitted, but in
no circumstances should such liberties be taken
with multiple disc metal clutches. (2) Your
engine is no doubt fitted with a down-draught
type carburettor, and stalling is due to an over-
rich mixture in the intake manifold. Never
pull the choke control out after stalling in this
fashion; it aggravates the trouble. Rather open
the throttle a little wider and spin the motor
until the mixture is restored to normal, when a
start will readily be effected.
XYZ (Melbourne). —(1) What is the market
value of a 1929 Chev. ? (2) Apart from knee
action, will the Standard model give equal ser-
vice to the Master Chev. ?
(1) Depends very greatly on condition. Can’t
value any second-hand car without seeing it.
(2) The Standard Chev. is built on similar lines
to the Master model; materials are of equal
quality, and the car is reliable.
E.McC. (Kensington, N.S.W.). —The clutch
in my 21-h.p. 1934 car is very fierce both in
first and reverse, particularly when the engine
is hot. Is this characteristic of this car, and
what should I do ?
Trouble is not characteristic. Ask the service
station to look into the matter,
W.H.S. (Yeronga, Q.) . —I propose to make
a {-ton trailer to hitch behind a Chev. truck.
Would a spring-cart axle do, and, if so, would
the cost of conversion be great ?
For your use would suggest looking for an
old Model T Ford rear end. It is ideal for
the purpose, and should cost only a few shil-
lings. Conversion of spring-cart axle to
accommodate car wheels would cost much
more.
J.R. (Gordonvale, N.Q.). —Instruction book
for Holt tractor recommends setting valve clear-
ances at .005 intake and .015 exhaust when hot.
What would you suggest when cold ?
Impossible to state “cold-set” clearances,
as engines differ. Only certain way to secure
correct timing and efficiency is to adjust after
engine has reached normal working tempera-
ture.
J.P. (South Hay, N.S.W.). —You recommend
relining of cylinders rather than reboring. (1)
What methods are employed in relining ? (2)
Advantages ? (3) Comparative cost ? (4) Where
can I get a T model Ford instruction book ?
(1) Liners are either screwed or shrunk into
cylinder bores. (2) With liners, existing balance
is maintained, using the original pistons.
Modern liners are cast from specially hard
metal, ensuring a much longer life than when
the old soft block is rebored. Should a liner
wear quickly or be damaged it can be replaced
without interfering with other bores in block.
(3) Relining costs 10 to 15 p.c. more than re-
boring. (4) None available at present.
C. (Baradine, N.S.W.).—/ damaged the
high-tension terminal in the centre of distributor
cap and fitted a brass screw as a temporary
repair. The engine started all right, but when
the clutch was let in on bottom gear the motor
stalled. I replaced the screw with wire,
and now experience no trouble. What’s the
explanation ?
In a high-tension circuit the spark will bridge
a considerable gap. The trouble has been
mechanical and not electrical. The screw, if
poorly fitted, would move, due to vibration, as
the clutch was engaged, and so temporarily
short the ignition.
J.M. (Seymour, Vic.). —I have a Bean truck,
1926 model, and have been refused allowance
on registration as the car is not wholly of
British manufacture. (1) Who were the
makers ? (2) Are they still on the market ?
(3) Is there a representative here ? (4) What
parts are not likely to be British ?
(1) Bean Cars, Ltd., in conjunction with Had-
field’s. (2) No. (3) No. (4) None, unless
foreign parts have been substituted during over-
haul or repair.
D. (Preston, Q.).—/ am thinking of
having cylinders of my 1929 Olds, sedan bored.
(1) What will it cost in Brisbane, plus fitting
of new pistons complete ? (2) Extra cost of
alloy pistons ? (3) Would cast-iron or alloy be
most suitable for this job ?
(1) £l2 should cover rebore, fitting new cast-
iron rings, pistons and gudgeons, lining up
pistons and con.-rods and assembly of block.
(2) Ten shillings per piston. (3) Original
pistons were cast-iron. You should replace
with similar type.

CONCERNING THE B BATTERY.
BY DON B. KNOCK.
Some country radio users know just what comprises the elements of the dry-cell
B battery, but to most it is just a sealed container with the necessary terminals.
The function and care of this source of plate voltage are here explained.
No doubt many readers have taken
to pieces and examined an old B battery
and wondered just how it is the small
metal cells can provide the power for
many months of radio reception. The
cross-section of a typical cell illustrated
here helps to make this clear.
Manufacturers have processes, parti-
cularly in Australia, where batteries
are called upon to do their work
under trying atmospheric conditions,
wherein the composition of the white
paste varies. Fundamentally, the for-
mula consists of the following: 10 parts
sal ammoniac, 5 zinc chloride, 5
glycerine, 5 flour, 30 plaster of Paris, 30
water.
The black depolariser, although in
some cases it carries extra ingredients,
consists essentially of 45 parts manganese
dioxide, 30 fine grain carbon, 14 graphite.
The zinc chloride keeps the paste wet
by absorbing moisture, and the glycerine
and flour keep it in a sticky condition.
The zinc container is acted upon chemi-
cally by the sal ammoniac, with the result
that a gas is given off and collects on the
carbon rod, tending to impede the cur-
rent flow. This is called “polarisation.”
Thus a depolariser is packed closely
around the carbon rod, the object of
this being to give the gas bubbles suit-
able collection points and, in time, to
remove them by chemical action.
Action between the sal ammoniac and
the zinc container causes an electrical
pressure of \\ volts between the poles of
the cell. Voltage depends only upon the
chemicals used, and is independent of the
physical size of the cell. A battery of 90
cells will thus deliver 135 volts, irrespec-
tive of the size of the cells, but the im-
portant point is the capacity. The larger
the cell the greater the capacity or “life”
of the cell.
When current is taken from the cell
the chemical action becomes vigorous,
and in time the zinc is eaten away. When
the sal ammoniac changes chemically
and the zinc is entirely consumed, the
cell is exhausted, and the battery is “flat.”
Experimenters have claimed that they get
prolonged life from dying B batteries by
placing them across a high D.C. voltage
and “charging” them. This small extra
action is merely due to extra-strong
chemical reversion, due to heating, and
is a waste of time with a battery that
is really discharged. When a B battery
is not in use, chemical action is taking
place in a very small degree, and is due
to unavoidable impurities in the zinc.
For this reason a battery has a limited
“shelf life,” after which it is exhausted,
though unused; therefore a battery
should not be purchased if it has been
overlong in storage. This is a sound
argument for Australian-made batteries.
They are not handicapped by a long sea
voyage and drastic temperature changes.
The leading Australian battery factories
only turn out the following day’s require-
ments on the previous day, so that dealer
and consumer get a perfectly fresh pro-
duct.
An important point is that the battery
must be chosen to suit the receiver. If,
for example, the receiver takes a current
drain of 15 milliamperes, the use of a
battery designed for lower current drain
will result in greatly shortened life. On
the other hand, a battery designed for
25 or more milliamperes used with the
15ma. receiver would not give a longer
life proportionately, because the termina-
tion of “shelf life” would reduce the
period of utility.
One of the greatest problems of bat-
tery manufacture is that of inter-cell in-
sulation. This has been tackled with
particular success in Australia, and cases
of poor inter-cell insulation and leakage
are to-day extremely rare. Leakage
occurs when cells are poorly insulated
from each other. Such leakage imposes
a continual drain on the battery, and
very soon shows up in intermittent crack-
ling and frying noises in the receiver.
The user can play his part in protect-'
ing his batteries as much as possible by

construction of a dry cell.
keeping them in a dry, cool place. Heat
accelerates the local action and evapo-
rates the moisture in the paste. Grid
bias should be used at the highest volt-
age consistent with good reproduction,
and by so doing the current taken from
the B battery is reduced to a minimum.
Grid-bias adjustments should be made
only with the receiver switched off. Apart
from the fact that valves with applied
plate voltage are likely to suffer minus
grid bias, the momentary drain from the
B battery is heavy with the receiver
switched on and the bias open.
With due care, modern B batteries can
be made to last a long time and to give
trouble-free service, but the receiver itself
must be taken into consideration. If
this is a current-waster and uses greedy
valves, as so many of the old-time re-
ceivers did, the batteries will not last
long. If the receiver is suitable for modi-
fication to use economical valves and
methods, this should be done ; otherwise
investment in a modern battery receiver
of correct design is well worth while.
AFTERTHOUGHTS ABOUT GRAINGER.
Percy Grainger has departed, after
having conveyed to Australia his musical
faith per medium of 12 lectures and as
many recitals, listened to, it may be
guessed, by a bigger audience than any
other lecturer has enjoyed in this country.
What has been the effect of his radical
teachings upon his listeners? It depends,
one would think, very largely upon the
age of the listener, upon the degree of
his or her capacity for musical apprecia-
tion, and particularly on whether the
mental attitude towards music is liberal
or conservative.
Though Grainger and such contem-
porary composers as Hindsmith, Honeg-
ger, Ornstein, Schonberg and Bartok are
notable exceptions, it is still the rule that
a systematised musical training makes
for conservatism. The serious young
student is taught to bow down before
certain idols and to regard as beyond the
pale all save a comparatively small circle
of classical Olympians. I say the serious
young student. Those who take up the
study of music in middle age, either as
executants, theorists or merely as lis-
teners who desire their judgments to be
well-instructed, are more likely to be
tolerant and broadminded. They are also
less likely to be impressed by professorial
assumptions of omniscience. They can
imagine that Papa Haydn would have
been highly delighted by some of the
Sousa marches, that Bach (who had his
jazz moments and scored some very effec-
tive “blues” in his “St. Matthew’s Pas-
sion”) might have been interested in
Irving Berlin, and that Mozart, who had
a good deal of experience with comic
opera, would have had more praise than
sneers for “The Gondoliers.”
To these catholic-minded music-tasters
Grainger’s breezy irreverence concerning
such fabled giants as Beethoven and
Brahms was refreshing ; it was, indeed,
by his refusals to bow down and by his
disregard of conventional standards that
the lecturer made his appeal to all sorts
of minds. The iconoclast always per-
forms a useful mission when he chal-
lenges old beliefs. Even if these old
beliefs are quite sound he compels those
who hold them to discover an intelligent
basis for their faith ; and that, it may be
hazarded, is the direction in which
Grainger has best served the cause of
musical enlightenment in Australia.
Of course, he is more than an icono-
clast. He is a theorist and a dogmatist,
and there is an Einsteinian flavor about
some of his dogmas, particularly Article
I: That music in any era, in any form
of society, is perfect as a reflection and
expression of the period and circum-
stances (social, topographical, economic
and religious) of the community in which
it was evolved. Hence Mr. Grainger
asked us not only to listen to, but to
adore, the caterwaulings of the Hairy
Ainus, the clumsiest of twelfth-century
discants, the quaverings of a nonagenarian
who sang English folk-songs from
memory with filigrees of his own inven-
tion, and the barbaric trills of the gong
orchestras of Java.
But the significance of Article I seemed
to be a bit overlaid when it was suggested
as a matter for admiration that a modern
French composer such as Debussy or an
Englishman such as Cyril Scott should
take his thematic material from an alien
land and a bygone age. If the folk-
song and morris-dance composers of
Old England (beloved of Grainger) had
gone to Tartary or Timbuctoo for their
themes, would their music still have been
a perfect reflection of the England of
their time? And if Grieg (also beloved
of Grainger), instead of concentrating on
the tonality, form and flavor of the tra-
ditional music of his own land, had de-
veloped an anti-rhythm, pro-Javanese
complex or decided to find his inspiration
in Gregorian plain-song, what would
have become of Scandinavian music?
The other great Graingerian dogma is
Article II: Music must be free. Appar-
ently, since all the ultra-modern com-
posers Grainger has held up for our edi-
fication produce work without recog-
nisable form and void of intelligible
intention, this means that as soon as a
form has been once used it must be
scrapped. The fact that Bach wrote
fugues ought to have deterred Handel,
Mendelssohn, Beethoven and Schumann
from similar exercises; as Haydn cry-
stallised the sonata-form the “Moon-
light” and “Appassionata” were redun-
dant. On sober reflection such a dogma,
instead of helping to make music free,
conspires to fetter it with heavy chains.
Rhythm must go, and with it the waltz,
the march and the mazurka; melody
must go ; accepted harmony must go ;
the tempered scale of Bach with its 12
notes to the octave must be replaced by
24-note or 48-note octaves, so that a
piano can emulate a saxophone or a
fiddle.
It doesn’t seem either reasonable or
necessary. Neither does it seem reason-
able nor fair to condemn Beethoven on
the grounds that his themes (many ad-
mittedly noble) are frivolously or shal-
lowly developed, while praising com-
posers who only escape the risk of similar
condemnation by using no ascertainable
theme whatever. The admission that
there is room for such a thing as a noble
theme nobly developed destroys most of
the basis of the Graingerian philosophy.
However, an earnest apostle may per-
petrate many inconsistencies without
losing respect for his sincerity of pur-
pose. Grainger’s main mission, though
he may not think so, has been to open
the minds of his hearers to the fact
that in the house of music are many
mansions. Places have to be prepared for
us in all of them before we can com-
fortably enter in, and it is just possible
that a hundred years from now a Schon-
berg composition that sounds to most of
us to-day like a cat rummaging for a
mouse in a coalscuttle will be whistled
by the butcher’s boy and afford him and
his hearers most exquisite delight.

our own car, but passing cars were heard
strongly. From Parramatta to Lapstone
signals were patchy; only heard on higher
elevations. General opinion is that signals
could have been heard much further, as
the highest point in the mountains was pot
visited. Any point on eastern slopes can
contact Sydney on five metres if attention
is paid to aerials. At all towns signals
were audible in moving car, and in all
cases a wire 4ft. long above ground brought
strength from R 3 to RB. The aerial used
in the car whilst in motion was relatively
inefficient, being horizontal and underneath
the hood.

About Television.
Ultra-short waves appear destined to
play an important part in the future of
television. It is well known that by limit-
ing television to medium (200 to
600 metres) the entertainment value will
be lacking, as television transmitted by
radio at these frequencies cannot go
beyond 30-line definition —furthermore,
30-line television needs a sideband width
of about 27 kilocycles.
Those who have witnessed demon-
strations of high-definition television
admit that it is so good that there is no
question about the entertainment value.
There appears to be no possibility of the
development of television with high
definition on medium wave-bands. The
one region in which space can be found
for such high-definition transmission is
on ultra-short waves, well below 10
metres. It has been found that ultra-short
waves are, contrary to. opinions of but a
few years ago, abounding with outstand-
ing advantages over even the short waves.
Almost complete freedom from fading
and atmospheric interference are two of
these advantages. The optical range
idea, whilst still indisputable for general
short-distance working, is now being
changed by the experimental work going
forward in many parts of the world, in-
cluding Australia, on directive trans-
mission with “beam”-type radiating
systems. The efforts of amateurs to
establish reliable ground-to-ground ranges
of 200 miles or so are valuable; and

amateurs are by no means “dabbling” on
the ultra-shorts, but setting up new
standards which will pioneer the way for
commercial application. Any competent
experimenter who investigates these
new fields of radio communication (made
important by the peculiar needs of tele-
vision) ought to be heavily subsidised
by the radio trade.
QUEREX.
American Report on Iron-cored
Coils.
The advantages of the iron-dust-core
R.F. coil as a component of radio re-
ceivers have been many times emphasised
on this page. There is still no evidence
that any Australian manufacturer com-
prehends the possibilities of the innova-
tion. Possibly the fact that the develop-
ment originated in Europe has caused
radio engineers in this country to sit
back till reports come from U.S.A.
laboratories. One such opinion is to
hand. “Electronics,” in a review of
the I.R.E. (U.S.A.) winter meeting,
says: “Further progress toward utilising
the higher-Q circuits [“Q” is selec-
tivity factor] obtained by the proper
use of iron cores to radio and inter-
mediate frequencies was disclosed.
Typical coils now for sale for use at
465 kc. having an inductance of 1.67 milli-
henries, wound with 7-strand 41 Litz and
having the same overall dimensions of
approximately lin., had Qs of 184 for
iron and 90.2 for air. Multiple-section
coils, representing the best the coilmakers
can do to-day in getting high Qs in small
size, were compared. The air coils of
1.5mh., for use at 370 kc., had a Q of 130,
while the iron-core coil had a Q of 216.
The virtues of iron-core coils in the an-
tenna stage, especially of automobile re-
ceivers, were pointed out. The results
of substituting iron for air coils in a
typical 4-tube tuned R.F. set showed that
the sensitivity at IOOOkc. was narrowed
from 660 micro-volts to 135, and that the
band width at 10 times at the same fre-
quency decreased from 43kc. to 22kc.
An 8-tube superhet with 450 kc. I.F. had
double the sensitivity and half the band
width. In this case the band width be-
came only 8.2 kc.”
Australian radio engineers might pon-
der on these conclusions with advantage,
both to themselves and the folk they
serve.
D.B.K.
Amateur Radio and the Feminine
Touch.
There are about 50,000 amateur radio
stations in U.S.A., and a number of these
are “YL” or “XYL” stations. Illustrated
is station W9LW, with its owner-opera-
tor, Mrs. Lee W. Mida, of Chicago, in
contemplation of her DX card-album.
W9LW works regularly on the 7000 kc.
band with Australians, and in a letter to
Mr. Colyer, of VK2EL, Sydney, Mrs.
Mida remarks: “What is the matter with
VK2s? Have sent 20 cards and got two
in return, and the VK short-wave listeners
send me half a dozen a week, with ques-
tions and requests for
photos. It’s not fair. If
you have any influence
with the VK2 gang,
please use it”.... N.S.W.
amateurs who have
worked with W9LW and
read this should do the
polite thing and supply
those missing cards.
W9LW’s gear comprises
a crystal-controlled trans-
mitter on 7075 kc. with
800 watts input and a
Hammarlund Comet Pro
superhet receiver with
A.V.C. and two-stage
pre-selector. Both are
good reasons why W9LW
puts a strong signal over
to Australia and hears
VKs well.
What’s What in Radio.
Ultra-short waves are receiving a great
deal of attention in the U.S.A. Following
on recent 56mc. (five-metre) directive
communication over a distance exceed-
ing 200 miles, a duplex range of 75 miles
has been covered on H metres. Most of
this work is being done between Hart-
ford, Connecticut and Boston, in Massa-
chussetts, and is organised by the Ameri-
can Radio Relay League. West Coast
enthusiast's are working along similar
lines, and D. Wallace, of station W6AM,
has erected a 171 ft. mast especially for
ultra-short-wave working.

In Australia, increasing interest is
being shown in directive u.-s.-w. work,
and in Sydney one beam is in action
(VK2NO, operated by The Bulletin’s
Radio Editor) and others are under con-
struction. It is anticipated that 5-metre
communication will shortly be estab-
lished between Sydney and points such
as Wyong and Newcastle.

The remarkable possibilities of fac-
simile picture communication between
Australia and England were demon-
strated during a lecture by E. T. Fisk at
Science House, Sydney. Mr. Fisk ex-
plained in detail to members of the In-
stitute of Radio Engineers the equip-
ment now in use by Amalgamated Wire-
less, Ltd. On the screen were shown
slides, and the historic movie film of the
England-Melbourne air-race winners as
transmitted by facsimile to England from
Australia and screened a few hours after
the event. The impression gained during
the lecture was that this was a record
of pioneer work equal to the first signals
Marconi sent across the Atlantic.

During the winter meeting of the In-
stitute of Radio Engineers (U.S.A.) at
Rochester a paper dealing with possible
applications of ultra-short waves for
regular broadcasting was read by L. C. F.
Horle. At the conclusion of this paper
an impressive demonstration of amateur
5-metre work was given by C. I. Franks.
Conversations were conducted between
the auditorium in which the meeting was
in progress and a motor-car cruising in
the vicinity.

Distant communication records on
waves in the region of 5 metres are not
really new. “QST” (U.S.A.), July, 1926,
had a report on work by French ama-
teur FBSM. This
states: “Using a 2-
tube Mesny oscil-
lator, he has at a
wave-length of 4.3
metres obtained dis-
tances of 600 kilo-
metres in both day-
light and darkness,
automatic recording
at high speeds being
possible.” VK4MM
points out in a letter
“that 600 k.m. is, by
the Admiralty for-
mula, 600 x .62, being
372 miles.” There
thus seems hope for
a Sydney-Brisbane
ultra-short channel of radio communi-
cation. The Frenchman’s achievement
was before the days of directive aerials.
♦ * * *
Latest radio-license figures from the
P.M.G.’s Department show that the
number in force in the Commonwealth
at the end of 1934 was 681,634, including
1259 experimental (amateur transmitters)
and 1519 free licenses (blind persons).
The ratio of licenses to 100 of popula-

A.W.A. has for some time been run-
ning a simultaneous transmission of
VK2ME’s overseas pro-
grammes on 7 metres to
facilitate tests with ultra-
short-wave experimenters in
the Sydney area. A report
from a reliable Brisbane
authority reaches The Bul-
letin office stating that the
7-metre transmission has de-
finitely been heard in two
Brisbane locations. In view
of the fact that the VK2ME
7-metre radiations are from
a non-directional doublet
aerial, this report is interest-
ing. A directive system,
aimed in various directions at
different times, should be of
great interest to ultra-short-
wave experimenters north
and south, also inland, from
Sydney.

It is reported from Eng-
land that a young University
student has got hold of some
revolutionary ideas in tele-
vision. These are concerned
with instantaneous transmis-
sion instead of the present
idea of building up the pic-
ture to slow speeds. The
only practical detail available
is that the apparatus can be
run from the usual power
point.
Evidence of the interest that television
is arousing in official circles in England
is shown by the fact that the Postmaster-
General, Sir H. Kingsley-Wood, has
authorised the British Post Office to con-
sider applications from amateur trans-
mitters who wish to experiment in the
direction of television transmission. This
is a step in the right direction, for ama-
teurs did great pioneering work for
broadcasting, and can repeat the process
in television transmission. Owners of
television receivers in Great Britain will
thus have programmes to turn to besides
those of the 8.8. C., which are at pres-
ent of short duration. In Australia tele-
vision accessories are not available to
amateurs, and experimenting is nipped
in the bud. However, one of the estab-
lished radio firms is making plans to
launch television in Australia.

It is claimed for the M.L. Broadcasting
Board’s new Auckland station IYA that
its studio building is the only one in
Australia or M.L. specially designed for
broadcasting and not improvised from an
existing building. It is a compromise
between the 8.8.C.’s London building
and the best American practice. To
make it completely soundproof there are
no windows, necessitating artificial light-
ing, heating and ventilation and present-
ing unusual problems to the architect.
Conditioned .air is supplied from equip-
ment in the basement. The transmitter
is newly housed (at a distance, of course),
and power has been increased from skw.
to lOkw. Later, it is possible that 60kw.
will be employed.

Few people other than those directly
interested in amateur radio communica-
tion realise the reliability of the Empire
link organised by the British Empire
Radio Union. The whole of the British
Empire is linked by amateur radio sta-
tions, and a considerable amount of
B.E.R.U. and R.S.G.B. traffic travels by
this route. Every year such matters as
the B.E.R.U. annual contest, loyal greet-
ings to the Prince of Wales, who is
patron, and any special details of tests
requiring Empire co-operation are
handled swiftly by the link stations. The
route is England-Maoriland-Hong Kong-
India-Iraq-Egypt-England, with branch
lines to Australia and South Africa. The
Australian end of the link is ably handled
by H. R. Carter, VK2HC, of Yarraman
North, Quirindi (N.S.W.).

The demand for speed in the handling
of radio communications has led to the
development by Amalgamated Wireless
of an automatic robot appliance which
is now being used both in Sydney and
Melbourne. Formerly at the La Perouse

the receiver was tuned it was connected

and from there another operator received

South Africa on 10 Metres?
L. E. Winton (Campbelltown, N.S.W.)
has been listening to amateur activity on
the 10-metre band, and reports hearing
ZSIH, of Rondebosch, South Africa, at
4.10 p.m. Sydney time, Sunday, 6/l/’35.
Strength was R 2. It is assumed that this
was a harmonic, as a check taken on 20
metres showed ZSIH working there,
strength being R 4 to R 5. Alternatively,
this may have been a dual transmission,
as ZSIH has told several Australians on
the 20-metre band that he intended work-
ing on 10 metres also.
Casual Comment.
Apart from impregnation of coils
against moisture, manufacturers should
pay similar attention to the insulation of
variable condensers. Trouble with a
superheterodyne of well-known make was
recently traced to the variable-condenser
gang. After everything else in the chassis
checked 0.K., the connections to the
stators in the condenser gang were re-
moved. The ohmeter showed 6000 ohms
between stators and rotors. This “rag”
composition insulation is not good enough
where moisture is concerned, and some-
thing akin to isolantit? should be used.
If such trouble can arise in humid
weather in Sydney, the outlook is poor
for those in N.Q. and the tropics. The
faulty condenser gang was made by
a manufacturer of national repute.

In conjunction with special 56mc.
directive-communication tests between
station W2DLG, located on the Hotel
New Yorker (New York, U.S.A.), and
WIAL at Hartford, Connecticut, the link
is being extended to permit English ama-
teurs to take part in duplex telephonic
conversations. This will be done by put-
ting the signal through a mixer panel to
amateur station W2CLA, operating on
20-metre telephony, and frequently heard
strongly in England. It is hoped that
transmissions from London will be picked
up similarly. The ultra-short waves seem
destined to play an increasingly import-
ant part in the future of radio broadcast-
ing, and particularly television.
Correspondence.
“A Listener” writes: While not wish-
ing to deprecate the work of the thousands
of experimenters who are doing much
good in advancing short-wave radio, I
have a grumble to emit. Why doesn’t Mr
Brasspounder keep a few kc. off the fre-
quency of such stations as DJA and
FYA? Granted that the short-wave
channels are somewhat congested, there
surely may be found spaces where one
can get in with a key without causing
worry and trouble to a poor devil of a
short-wave listener who is trying to enjoy
a quiet broadcast and finds that reception
is completely ruined by the Morse run-
ning through it. Just now Old-man Static

Australian experimenters would be
buyers of various up-to-date compon-
ents if these were on the Australian mar-
ket. The advertising pages of overseas
journals reveal countless items dear to
the heart and pocket of experimenters,
but for a long while the heart has
yearned and the pocket has had no call
upon it. Colville Wireless Equipment Co.,
Rowe-street, Sydney, aims to make a gap
in that pocket and at the same time
apply salve to the yearning heart. The
firm makes a point of importing just
those things that are badly needed.
Some are necessarily high-priced owing
to duty and freight, but others are well
within reach. A consignment of Birn-
bach stand-off, lead-through and socket-
type porcelain insulators has just arrived,
and prices range from lOd. to 3s. Porce-
lain transposition blocks for doublet
aerials are also available. To fit socket-
type stand-off insulators a limited supply
of genuine G.R. banana plugs with
.screw top is in stock.
The Q. and A. Column.
Please illustrate a diagram, with details, of a
simple super-regenerative receiver for 56me.
work. Are there any stations to be heard on
this amateur frequency range around the Sydney
district ? —224.
The diagram shows an easily-made two-valve
super-regenerator in which the first valve is
the detector and the other the interruption
oscillator. The valves are triodes, and can be
types such as the 30, PM2DX, A 415, A 409 or
8217, depending upon the filament voltage.
The grid and plate coils for the detector are
each five turns of 16 enamelled or tinned
copper wire, wound with a Jin. diameter and
spaced the diameter of the wire. The tuning
condenser is a four-plate midget variable, and
the series condenser between the two coils a
.0001-mfd. condenser. This can be a fixed
condenser, but, if variable, is useful as a
bandsetter. The R.F. choke consists of 35
turns of 30 enamelled on a |in. former with
the turns well spaced out. Coupling to the
aerial is through a very small two-plate capa-
city such as an old neutralising condenser. In
the plate and grid circuit of the second valve
are the primary and secondary windings of the
interruption unit. For the plate, 800 turns of
36 enamelled, and for the grid, 1200 turns of
the same wire, wound on a |in. dowel with
three bakelite discs Ifin. in diameter and
spaced -fin., will do. The polarity of these
windings must be correct or the I.F. valve will
not oscillate. No audio amplifier is shown
here, but it is easy to add one if wanted.
In action the receiver will make a rushing sound
which is cut out when a strong signal (carrier
wave) is tuned in. The rushing sound is due
to high sensitivity. Stations operating nightly
in Sydney on this frequency include 2WD,
2MW, 2CG, 2SA, 2SN, 2UC, 2NO, 2LJ, and
many more are preparing for activity, particu-
larly with directive transmissions aimed at

radio receiver and a small portable gramo-
phone. (1) Could an electrical pick-up be
fitted to the gramophone and worked through
the radio ? (2) Would enough volume be avail-
able to provide music for a small dance hall ?
(3) Approximate cost ? —225.
(1) Yes. The audio portion of the receiver
can be used as the amplifier. (2) Depends on
the audio amplifier part of the receiver and
the speaker. (3) About £2 10s', assuming that
no alteration is necessary in the audio side of
the receiver.
I propose to buy a battery set as soon as re-
ception conditions here ( Augathella, Q .)
become within the bounds of reason. Please
tell me: (1) Which is the best broadcast (not
all-wave) receiver for general performance ?
Six-valve sets here leave a lot to the imagina-
tion in so-called daylight reception. (2) Have
you a good set in mind for publication for this
next winter ? (3) Are all-wave sets really a suc-
cess or is one buying a novelty rather than a
real instrument ?- —226.
(1) Can’t say, not having tested them all.
There are many good sets available. If your
reception conditions are extraordinarily diffi-
cult, it would be worth while having a special
receiver designed and built. Possibly a high-
gain tuned R.F. type should be suitable in
your case. You do not say what type of six-
valve sets failed to give the desired daylight
signals. (2) Yes, but it will require the use
of components not on the market. A special
kit is expected from overseas, and if the re-
sulting receiver justifies itself no effort will
be spared to see that the isolated listener gets
the benefit, both through these pages and the
trade. (3) They are good, bad and indifferent.
Those advertised in The Bulletin are good.
The all-wave model gives you something in
addition to standard broadcast reception, and
the short-wave feature should be valuable in
your part of Australia, if only for the sake
of such stations as VK2ME and VK3LR, not
to mention overseas stations.
/ have built the Wide-World Two, described
B. 15/8/’34, and for power supply am using
a six-volt heater transformer and Philips 3002
B eliminator. Fluctuation of the line voltage
causes trouble, and the set breaks into and
out of oscillation as the voltage rises and falls.
Stations cannot be brought up to a steady
volume because of this. What can be done to
remedy the trouble ? —227.
The variation in the power supply must be
considerable to affect this particular type of
receiver so much, as the electron-coupled de-
tector is much more stable in this respect than
the usual kind. If a centre-tap resistor is used
across the heaters, try dispensing with this and
connecting the B negative to one side. The
most certain cure for this trouble is a voltage
regulator, which can be made by connecting
two neon lamps in series across the D.C.
output of the eliminator. Murdoch’s, Ltd.,
has some neon lamps at Is. 6d., and these
should be suitable.

“Como”: A bold proposal for prevenK
ing the erosion of Port Phillip beaches
and cliffs (B. 6/2/’35) is the making of an
island in the middle of the bay where the
water is shallow. The late Tom Bent put
forward this idea when he was Premier,
but never went on with it, though Bent’s
scheme was merely to pile up sand, which
would sooner or later be washed away.
The present suggestion is either to plant
mangroves to bind the sand or, if pos-
sible, transplant polyps and build up a
solid breakwater of coral.

“Dune”: I know a Sydney firm which
goes one better than having its pay-bag
manacled to the wrists of the bearers
(B. 9/1 / ’35). Met one of my pals who
has to do this job each week, not only
with the bag chained to his wrist, but
wearing a large pair of horn-rimmed
glasses. Knowing that his eyes are as
good as mine, I suppose I looked sur-
prised, and he explained that this was
a brain-wave on the boss’s part in order
to combat the pepper- and acid-throwers.
It strikes me as quite a sensible pre-
caution.

“Stick ’Em Up”: “Norbell’s” youthful
bank clerks who used to traverse the
streets “on exchanges” carrying well-
stocked bags (B. 23 /1 / ’35) hardly needed
police escorts. In this country the
exchange clerk’s charge would con-
sist of cheques and bills, mostly non-
negotiable. No pay-roll robber of any
standing would have frittered away his
energies on an exchange clerk. In my
time, by the way, that youth didn’t use
a bag, but carried his cheques in the
book, which had to be checked and
signed by the inward exchange clerks at
other banks.

when their heroes appeared, clad in tights
and spangles, what a roar used to go up!
Fellows with barrels like casks, with
biceps bigger than their calves, would
dance down the track with the high-
stepping action so necessary in a pre-
liminary, with the corks tight held —no
proper runner in those days could give
of his best without corks. And the
wagers, the arguments afterwards, the
flowing pots, the fights, the boast that
Nobby an’ Leopard could pull Blinker
an’ Spanker out of their socks! They
never have a lorry-drivers’ race now.

The feminine craze for the blood-red
talon is hard to explain. About nine out
of every 20 women go crimson-tipped,
and this has led to an awful breeze in an
exclusive Australian club. One day a
woman playing bridge was seen to flick
a note to her partner. Indignation, with
a demand to see the written word, fol-
lowed. The lady to whom the message
had been sent refused to show it, and
finally the club president was called in.
At last, fearing the stigma of cheat, the
writer and the receiver delivered up the
note. It read: “Let’s hurry and get out
of this. I can’t stand those bloody nails
opposite.”

“Old Hand”: In “Letters of Joseph
Furphy” (R.P. 16/1 /’35) the following
appears:
I got quite thick with Archibald, Mont-
gomery, A.G.S., Dorrington, Norman Lind-
say and Daley. Also, I fraternised with
William Macleod, who is as intellectual,
witty and genial as any of the rest. All
the “B.” staff have one thing in common,
viz., baldness.
The reference to baldness puzzles me.
Macleod had a healthy head of hair to
the day of his death ; so had “Hop.”
Norman Lindsay isn’t bald now. Archi-
bald and Montgomery had thinning
thatches early in the century, but they
never went bald. The most noticeable
thing about Bulletin men of 30 years
ago was their passion for beards. Mac-
leod, Archibald, “Hop,” Stephens,
Edmond and Montgomery all affected
face-fungus.

Views of “Villers-Bret.”;
Unfortunately it isn’t practical politics ,in a
British community to make backstairs generals
drop their military .titles (“Ex-Temp. Gent.,” B.
26/12/’34). Where would you stop? A'knight
(“Oxford Dictionary”) means primarily ' “a
military follower.... a . person of chivalrous or
quixotic spirit.” What havoc in the ranks of
our Australian nobility if none but the knightly
were allowed to keep their knighthoods! Every
“military follower” (Aust., Digger) agrees that
one who calls himself general, though he never
led so much as a brigade in action, is doing
his bit towards bringing the service into con-
tempt, but the imposture carries its own penalty.
If a descendant of, say, Major-General Rosen-
thal came out with a variant of the classic war-
time poser “And what did you do to become
a general in the Great War?” the hero of Mont
St. Quentin would merely have to point to
Bean’s history. The only recourse of a bogus
general would be to warn his offspring against
impudence. Not one in a hundred has the nerve
to risk such setbacks; so the tally of generals
who didn’t is probably as small in the British
Empire as in any part of the word, barring
the U.S.A.

A couple who recently passed through
Melbourne on a motoring jaunt arrived
at a Riverina town in time for dinner, had
a look at the local sights and turned in,
the. man to sleep soundly, the woman to
lie awake for hours. A party was happen-
ing in an adjoining room. At 1 a.m. the
wife decided it was time to do something
abotit the noise. She woke her husband,
but the management could not be found.
After a tour of investigation the couple
discovered an empty room at the other
end of the building, to which they trans-
ported their baggage. The young woman
sighed with contentment as she sank on
to the pillow, but it was the man’s turn
to be displeased with life. As half-asleep
he had staggered along the passage in
bare feet, wearing his wife’s fur coat
over his pyjamas, her hat trimmed with
marguerites, a , suitcase in one hand
and several shoes in the other, a door
opened to disclose several bright young
things who burst into derisive laughter.
“Look at the old bird staggering home
after his jag!” one screamed; and a
squashy cream cake landed right on the
back of his neck. “And they didn’t even
offer me a drink,” he reflected bitterly
as he lay wide awake on the thin, lumpy
mattress.

“J.D.’s” confession of faith:
The proselytising atheist —all too often, I
have noticed, an economic frustrate whose gift
of words is in inverse ratio to his earning
capacity—keeps getting setbacks from the
scientist. Here is Sir John Fleming, the physi-
cist, saying that man didn’t evolve from the
ape millions of years ago.
The rate of increase of a single pair
of humans in 9000 years would become
1,000,000,000. They would thus have
filled up the whole known world. Yet the
only discoveries have been a few dozen
skeletons in isolated, separated places.
The worst knock to Christianity would be the
discovery that human beings existed on some
other planet; proof that the conditions were
such as to admit of their existence would
be enough. Jeans and the rest of the astro-
nomers say there is no world except ours that
could support beings even remotely resembling
ourselves.
My chief reason for believing that there is
something in Christianity is, however, uncon-
nected with science. I lack the intellectual
nerve to agree that doctrines which were
accepted by the possessors of some of the
most luminous minds of their day —Pascal,
Milton, Gladstone, Lord Chief Justice Russell,
Foch, the Cecils —can be below the notice of a
thoughtful illiterate. The leading atheist of our
suburb is the iceman’s offsider. He knows
all the arguments against miracles; but as
often as he uses them I find myself thinking
that it.would be the most tremendous miracle
of all if the theories of this wordy half-wit
turned out to be right.

SPORTING
NOTIONS
Under the Whip
Williamstown racing had an important
bearing on prospects for the Victorian
autumn meetings. Sylvandale, who is to
oppose his stable-companion, Theo, in
the St. Leger, met three other classic
aspirants—Farndale, Musstte and Ver-
berry—in the Williamstown Stakes, Ti-
rades. The race was for three- and
four-year-olds, with penalties and allow-
ances, but Hall Mark alone carried a
penalty (101 b.) and none claimed allow-
ances.
Holt and his patron, C. B. Kellow, owe
Fred Williams a debt of gratitude for
having brought Sylvandale across from
Sydney. Because of the Silvius colt
having put up such a great fight with
Theo in the Victoria Derby, he was con-
sidered to have a splendid chance of
lowering the colors of Hall Mark with
a pull of 211 b. in weight. Farndale, who
finished particularly well in a first-up
appearance on January 26 in the William
Reid Stakes at Moonee Valley, also had
a strong following. These influences,
combined with Hall Mark having been
beaten out of a place—however nar-
rowly—in the C. F. Orr Stakes at Wil-
liamstown on January 28, led to the son

C. B. Kellow, though by no means
fully recovered from the illness with
which he was stricken when returning
from an overseas trip several months
ago, was in the members’ enclosure. He
saw bonny little Hall Mark score in fine
style. Joining Sylvandale and Break
Up at the head of affairs five furlongs
from home, the son of Heroic clapped
on full speed at the half-mile. Demp-
sey’s efforts to assume the lead coming
to the turn were frustrated by Pratt, who
pushed Sylvandale along for all his
worth. Sandwiched between Hall Mark
(outside) and Break Up, the colt
struggled on, but half-way down the
straight it was manifest that class would
tell. Hall Mark asserted his superiority
at the distance, and drew away to win
by \\ lengths. Farndale put in a capital
finish to beat Break Up for third honors.
Williams was far from displeased at
the showing of Sylvandale, who again
revealed courage. Second prize was £3OO
—more than the colt could have earned
for winning at one of the “off” meetings
in Sydney, where, generally speaking,
prize-money is not nearly so liberal as
in Melbourne. Verberry did not shape
sufficiently well to justify Leger hopes,
though he may take beating in the Aus-
tralian Cup on a handicap basis. Farn-
dale once more showed his worth, but
he is an unlucky colt. In the spring this
son of Curialis ran Journal to a neck
in the Caulfield Cup.
Nuit d’Or will have to be seriously
reckoned with in the Australian Cup if
sent to the post for the 2£-mile race.
He is trained by Holt for Philip Russell,
of the V.R.C. committee, who bred him.
On several occasions since he began
racing this four-year-old son of The
Night Patrol has shown rich promise.
In the hands of Holt he has made con-
siderable advance, and now is a very
fit horse. Though regarded by his trainer
as a trifle “new,” Nuit d’Or was solidly
supported for the Wyndham Handicap,
of 11 furlongs, and went out next in de-
mand to Robert.
Without doubt Nuit d’Or would have
won but for overpowering Dempsey in
the early stages. No other candidate
would make the running, and Dempsey
was obliged to let his mount stretch out.
Burlesque supplanted Nuit d’Or near the
straight-entrance, but Holt’s banner-
bearer put in another effort and finished
less than a length behind the cast-off
from Donohoe’s stable.
Robert shaped below expectations, and
missed a place, but his trainer, Lou
Robertson, landed the Juvenile Handicap
for A. T. Creswick, and appropriated the
February Trial with his own horse Mara-
bou, a three-year-old that was backed
for the Melbourne Cup. This was the
initial victory of Marabou, who has cost
his owner a lot of money in wagers.
Feldspar created a profound impres-
sion by his Electric Handicap success,
and may be heard of in the rich juvenile
contests of the autumn. He is by
Heroic’s brother Thracian from Quartz
by All Black (sire of Desert Gold) from
Quiara (imp.) by St. Amant.
Several Newmarket Handicap can-
didates had an outing in the Marine
Handicap, for which Radiant Star and
Press Gang shared favoritism. The
former is a handsome three-year-old, for
whom G. L. Scott gave 1600gns. towards
the end of last year. Radiant Star tried
to register a one-act victory. He shook
off Titanium at the half-way stage, and
led into the straight as if assured of
victory; but the improving Ogwell,
ridden by Neville Percival, then joined
issue. After a hot tussle, Ogwell gained
the verdict by a neck. Press Gang, who
found his legs somewhat slowly and met
with slight interference, was travelling
faster than any of them over the last
couple of furlongs, and beat Tapageur
for third. The run will improve Radiant
Star, but both Ogwell and Press Gang
may be his masters over the “straight
six” at Flemington.
* * * *
“Tuart”: Hall Mark’s defeat of Syl-
vandale at 101 b. worse than w.f.a. but-
tresses The Bulletin’s oft-expressed
opinion that the 1934-35 three-year-olds
—Capris possibly excepted—are not much
good. A fair test of a three-year-old’s
worth is ability to beat older horses at
w.f.a., with or without allowances. It has
been done by scores of good horses, from
Carbine to Peter Pan, but not by any of
the present batch of moderates. On per-
formances, Theo is the best of them, but
he is the best of an indifferent lot.
* * * *
An interesting candidate for the big
autumn handicaps is Wheriko (Night
Raid —Satisfaction). Asa three-year-
old, racing in Eric Connolly’s colors, he
won the V.A.T.C. Chatsworth Plate and
Warriston Handicap and ran third in
the V.R.C. Stand Handicap to Petau,
giving him 171 b. After an unplaced per-
formance in the Caulfield Guineas, he
was put aside—“for the Doncaster,”
people said; but he did not figure in
that race, and punters lost sight of him.
Recently they learned that Wheriko had
been doing well in Maoriland for A. D.
Webster, for whom, indeed, he has won
three races. Webster has brought the
nag, now a five-year-old, back to Aus-
tralia. He is in the Newmarket with
Bst. 71b., but may not be ready to do
himself justice in that race.
* * * *
King March is to sport silk in the Aus-
tralian Cup, in which he has Bst. 31b.
Though getting up in years he is a
genuine stayer who will be suited by the
long stretches at Flemington. He will
be ridden by Bartle.
* * * *
Multudo is not to run in the Oakleigh
Plate, an event in which he ran third last
year ; but he should not be neglected by
Victorian punters. The Moabite gelding
has been working particularly well at
Warwick Farm. He is a noted mudlark.
% * * *
Very unlucky in the matter of weather
this last year, the Canterbury Park club
had to postpone its Saturday meeting
until to-morrow. The officials, anxious
that the fixture should go on, waited
until midday before coming to a decision.
Queensland Cup winner Braeburn is
again among the regular workers at
Randwick. He looks well after his spell.
Walker, his trainer, has bought a prop-
erty adjacent to the Hawkesbury course
at Clarendon, and on his return from
the Victorian autumn meetings may
train Silver King and other members of
his team there.
* * * *
Peter Pan is undergoing a quiet pre-
paration at Randwick for A.J.C. weight-
for-age races. He will have stiff opposi-
tion from Hall Mark and Rogilla. The
lastnamed has progressed the right way
since resuming work at Randwick, and
no horse there looks better.

Racquet and Bawl
“Rev. Knucklebone”: Whatever may
be the case with its Governments, little
Austria rules its tennis affairs with a
high hand. Recently the Austrian
L.T.A. announced its list of penalties and
punishments for the season. One gentle-
man who had been “rude” to an umpire
was hung on the peg for eight months.
Two others went up for six months for
playing in unauthorised tourneys under
false names, and the president of a club
got two years for playing under a nom
de racquet, his captain sharing his fate
for conniving at his villainy. Australian
club officials will hear with envy that
countless players who failed to pay their
subscriptions were suspended until the
cash was forthcoming.
* * . * *
“Lilywhite”: So far Czecho-Slovakia,
Britain and India seem to be the only
countries likely to vote for the alteration
of rule 23 of the International Tennis
Federation,' designed to permit amateurs
appearing for pay in films depicting
tennis. America, France, Spain, Austria
and Italy have announced themselves
hostile. The matter will come up before
the federation about the middle of
March.
“Top Spin”: South Africa, very keen
on getting the Australian Davis Cuppers
on their way home to Australia, cabled
recently asking for a definite reply. The
Afrikanders are fielding a team in the
European zone, and it was hoped that
our men would accompany them after
the Cup final and play in the Union
championships. The Australian heads
have definitely refused the invitation.
Meanwhile, the long-overdue return visit
by an Australian team to Japan remains
ignored.
* * * *
“Cash Amateur”; Tilden isn’t having
much luck with his world’s professional
tournament for the Bernadel Cup, which
was to dim the lustre of the Davis
Cup. Belgium and Spain barred all the
amateur tennis arenas against him, and
now France has hopped in with a refusal
to let him use the Roland Garros courts,
the only possible venue in Paris, for the
closing stages of the European end of
the tourney, the semi-finals and finals of
which are to be played in America.
* * * *
“Cash Amateur”: Harley Mathews, ex-
secretary of the Australian L.T.A.,
opposes the removal of the ban on film
appearances, but adds that if the rules
as to amateurism as they stand are en-
forced there will be no more first-class
amateurs playing. He is not so apposite
when he says that Brookes and Patterson
did not seek to make money out of their
tennis. Both were well-fixed for cash
outside tennis, and had no need to bother
about spending silver. J. O. Anderson
bewails, as a professional, the manner in
which the amateurs are cutting into the
money. Also, he opposes the now-fixed
practice of paying the expenses of players’
wives on the European tour. He asks
what will be done if some day all the
players develop indispensable wives, and
adds that if, in his time, anyone suggested
the advance of a fiver towards the ex-
penses of the missus he ran a good
chance of official ostracism.
0 Continued on page 36.)
“Shrewsbury”: Oxford, determined to
break the long trot of Cambridge suc-
cesses in the boatrace, has condescended
at last to imitate its Light Blue rival and
practise in staked boats. This method
consists in fastening the stern of the craft
to a post in the stream and then rowing
like blazes while the boat remains in
the same place. This enables the crew
to study its own faults in fixed mirrors.
* * * *
“Long Dog”: While politicians are
yapping about establishing an export
trade with Eastern Asia, some of the
boys have bogged in and got a flourish-
ing young industry going. Last week over
100 tin-hare greyhounds left for Macao,
the Portuguese settlement off Canton—-
one of the world’s few remaining
gambling hells.
* . * * *
Vic. Rowing Association recently de-
cided that the starter at all events should
be stationed at one end of the line of
competing boats. Ballarat has arisen in
its wrath to point out that such a scheme
is impossible on Lake Wendouree, where
heats are unknown and where 19
crews have started together. With the
starter in the middle, the 19 got away in
line ; but with a starter at one end the
contest would probably resemble a pur-
suit race.
* * * *
The final heat of the 18ft. champion-
ship and the title went to the Queensland
boat Aberdare, a win in the first heat
giving her a total of 30 points. The
second heat, sailed in heavy rain and a
light breeze, had been won by the Sydney
boat Scot, but the only other points she
scored was for a fourth placing in the
final. Third and fourth places were filled
by Marjorie Too (Q.), 14 points for two
seconds, and the N.S.W. H. C. Press, 10
points. for a second and a third. The
races were sailed on Sydney Harbor.

The PARIS INTERNATIONAL TRADE FAIR
to be held from May 18 to June 3, 1935.
Whatever your business, there is a definite advantage in the knowledge
of progress being made abroad.
With a marvellous exposition of the world’s manufacture, the Paris
International Trade Fair offers the most convenient, economical and
pleasant method of gaining this knowledge.
In 1934 the Paris Trade Fair occupied 4.000,000 square feet of space
and visitors from all parts of the world numbered over 2,000,000.
MAKE PARIS YOUR HEADQUARTERS IN MAY, 1935.
For full information, write to the French Trade Commissioner, 7 Wynyard Street, Sydney.

MIDDLE-AGE
Beware Age 40—When your Life
Line starts threateningly to Decline.
The average life ends at about 55. At 40,
the pace noticeably slows—and worrying
signs appear. These tell of kidney and
bladder breakdown; failure to eliminate the
system's poison wastes, especially of uric
acid. Back. loin and groin pains appear,
swollen joints and limbs; increasing need for
urination: possibly severe inflammation ol
the bladder and urinary tract; rheumatism,
which cripples and weakens the heart. Keep
your kidneys and bladder in health by taking
Harrison's Pills, the signed remedy of a Lon-
don doctor. These will free you from aches,
pains, stiffness, and that growing weariness
and weakness arising from your kidney and
bladder strain. Harrison’s Pills will give you
% new source of strength and health at a time
when neglect may prove irreparable. Doctors
and nurses recommend Harrison’s Pills, while
chemists everywhere sell them at trifling cost.
Under the Whip
Those who picked out Sir John and
Topical for a double when the New-
market and Australian Cup weights were
declared must have been pleased with
their performances at Rosebery (Sydney)
on Wednesday. Each was drawn in a
division of the Flying Handicap, 6i
furlongs, and went out a warm favorite,
having little to beat: Topical defeated
Cynical and Bowery, conceding each
nearly 2st., in Imin. 20|sec.; Sir John,
with Bst. 71b. up, accounted for Spring-
fern and Lady Baeda in the same time,
which is a course record. Sir John, who
is by Limond —Jewel of Asia, has grown
into a very fine-looking colt, and will
probably compensate Moss in the
autumn for his disappointments in the
spring. He is relatively better treated
at Flemington than Topical, who, at Bst.
121 b., will find it difficult to concede a
stone to Cueesun, winner of the last two
Perth Cups and unbeaten in four races
at Perth this season. Present indications
are that Cueesun will start favorite.
* * * *
The savage taxation imposed by the
Sydney Government is making the way
of the N.S.W. country racing club hard.
Newcastle J.C. announces a loss of £2892
for the 1934 year; State taxation in-
creased from £2812 to £3948. Reports in
a similar strain come from Albury and
Forbes. Racing in such places is a very
enjoyable feature of life, and it is useful
to the breeding industry withal. The
clubs are sporting bodies in the best sense
of the word. It is a shame that they
should be driven to despair by taxes
clapped on without knowledge by Big-
City politicians.
* * * *
Nightguard, a brother to Phar Lap,
is racing without success among hacks in
Maoriland. He brought 1500 guineas as
a yearling, but after repeated failures was
sold for 15 guineas. Brothers and sisters
of famous horses rarely amount to much.
The mating of Magpie and Charleville
produced exceptions. Windbag was a
great horse. Loquacious was quite first-
class and Bicolor (lately dead) might have
turned out as good as the mare had he
remained sound. For their brother Mag-
nifico, however, the late John Brown in
an expansive moment gave 4000 guineas,
and never got a race out of him.
* * * *
The doubles bookmaker has been doing
well of late on Sydney courses. At the
prices he lays he can rarely fail to
show a tidy profit. He will be a gone
coon from the moment the doubles tote
arrives ; and people who go racing can’t
be refused it for ever. Adelaide punters
would not do without it, and from an
example furnished at the last Morphett-
ville meeting this is understandable.
There was only one double, the races
chosen being the Viceregal and Loyalty
Handicaps. The winners were Great
Span, 7 to 2 with the bookmakers, and
Isosceles, 4 to 1 ; the tote paid £8 3s. 3d.
for ss. Great Span and Isosceles, and
£3 16s, Great Span and Glorify—second
in the Loyalty Handicap. Imagine any
Sydney merchant of doubles paying out
32 to 1 on a couple of favorites, let alone
14 to 1 for first and second!
* * * *
Saturday-night trotting, one of the
Adelaide Government’s contributions to
the solution of the depression problem,
has caught on in the once-Holy City.
As in Perth, which has had the thing for
21 years, it is getting crowds rivalling
those drawn by the gallopers. A 4s.
doubles tote is one of the attractions.
M.Q. (and Rafferty) Rules
A German, Walter Neusel, is heavy-
weight champion of England—that is, if
a German can hold the empty title. At
Wembley last week he stopped Jack
Petersen in the 11th round. Petersen’s
inability to knock out poor old George
Cook demonstrated that he was not much
of a fighter. He took a terrific hiding
gamely (and got £3,500 for it); but game-
ness is not enough.
* * * *
“D.E.”: For two weeks now the prin-
cipal Sydney Stadium bouts have been
between American boxers, and two more
from the other side of the Pacific are to
meet next Monday night. This in a
country from which there once went to
the U.S.A. champions in every division:
Jackson, Slavin and Goddard; Fitz-
simmons, Hall, Creedon and McCarthy ;
Dawson, Tracey and Williams ; Griffo,
Willis and Anthony, and many more. It
is the result of inferior teaching, bad
matchmaking and short-sighted and sel-
fish management. The old-time patron
was superior in many respects to the
modern promoter. He at least saw that
his lad was well-coached, -trained and
-matched, and looked after him in other
ways. How different are things now!
Few of the boys now following the game
can hope to make even the basic wage
until it gives them up ; and, because so
many injudicious matches are made, that
may not take long, as too many poor
fellows could testify. And there is no
workers’-compensation clause for incapa-
citated or burnt-out bruisers. In a
change to amateur control, with a chain
of organisations in the States wherein
boxing still lingers, lies the only hope
for the professional pug.
Ins and Outs
The N.S.W. selectors have given sev-
eral players new to Sheffield cricket a
chance to play against Queensland in
Brisbane on February 15, among them
“Ana what do I do now, sport?”
“Aw, climb up the rod and stab it!”
Ryan, a fast-medium bowler from New-
castle, and Fallowfield, of Northern Dis-
tricts. Marks, of Randwick, who should
be a permanent member of the side, goes
in again, and Little, another good second-
eleven performer, who went to Queens-
land as twelfth man, gets another chance
to carry the drinks. The same side is
to make the Westralian trip if it
comes off.
* * * *
“Noblesse, etc.”: There is a striking
contrast between the attitude of Wyatt
over the bodyline protest recorded by
Richardson at Trinidad and that of Jar-
dine when Tarrant no-balled one of the
English bowlers on the Indian tour.
Wyatt immediately acted on Richardson’s
advice and took his man off without
question, while he has joined with the
local authorities in asking Richardson to
umpire further matches. Jardine insisted
that Tarrant, an Australian like Richard-
son, should not be allowed to umpire in
the closing matches of the tour.
“Aunt Sally”: Lord Hawke is out
again with a proposal that pads should
be limited in size so as to render them
comparatively useless for covering the
wicket. Any player of 20 or 30 years
ago can certify to the enormous in-
crease in size of the leg-coverings
since the war. There are makes
that practically encircle the leg in-
stead of covering the front only, while
the flap above the knee has grown up-
wards until a small batsman can barely
see over the top. The same is true of
wicket-keeping gloves, now stuffed and
reinforced in a fashion which would have
amazed the stumpers of years agone.
There were then no under-gloves or
special stalls heavily padded at the top
for each finger, but just a reasonable
amount of protection. Whenever I read
of the perfect condition of Bert Oldfield’s
hands —a favorite theme with some
cricket rhapsodists—l think of the
gnarled and battered paws of some of
his predecessors ; Jim Kelly is only one
of several instances.
* * * *
“Bramall Lane”: There was no need
for an English professional cricketer to
take advantage of the Marylebone club’s
post-war indulgence permitting all re-
turned-soldier professionals to play as
amateurs if they desired (B. 30/1/’35). It
seems to have been just a matter of per-
sonal choice on the part of the player.
There were previous instances of the
change-over. One of the most notable
was that of Richard Daft, of Notts, who
let the cash go and went for the credit
far back in the 1880’s. Daft, like Jupp,
came of a long line of professional
players, and was the stylist of his time.
* * * *
“Junior Turf Club”; Some bright
youth has been suggesting that the Syd-
ney C.G. people should get out of their
difficulties by making their show a social
organisation, on
the lines of the
Wanderers’ Club
at Johannesburg
and the concerns
in Phi ladelphia
and New York
which combine
cricket and other
games with the
ordinary ameni-
ties of a good-
class club, plus
dinner dances.
But the Wan-
derers and their
American breth-
ren are in a dif-
f e r en t category
from the Sydney
ground. They are
purely private
affairs, and mem-
bers have to be
elected by ballot
—even in the case
of the Jo’burg
institution a care-
fully - supervised
one. Membership
of Sydney C.G. is
open to any per-
son who can pay
the annual sub-
scription. Moreover, under the agree-
ment with the Rugby League, it will be
thrown open to thousands of supporters
of professional football —the figure men-
tioned was 6000 —who can dump down
their guinek for League membership. In
these circumstances one cannot see the
Sydney C.G. driving the Union Club out
of business.
* * * *
“Larakai”: Cricket as played in New
Guinea is something to make the mouth
of the Test-match fiend water. The open-
ing match of the season at Port Moresby
began at 2.30 one afternoon ; from the
two sides a team to play Wau (M.T.)
was to be picked. The opening partner-
ships were “superannuated” when they
reached the fifties to give the others a
chance. There was 185 minutes’ play
and 416 runs were scored- —the last 230
in 95 minutes. N.G. Test teams, by the
way, fly to keep their engagements.
The Nineteenth Hole
“Brassey”; When in Australia Sarazen
advocated the sending of Bolger on
a tour of the U.S.A., and offered to con-
tribute £5O. The matter was taken up
privately, and over £3OO was collected;
then it was decided to do no more till
the rush of big golf was over. Now the
N.S.W. professional golfers, headed by
A. W. East, are preparing a campaign
to raise further sums.
* * * *
“Lofter”: Henry Cotton has become
enamored of steel shafts, and has written
a book extolling them. Cotton says that
when the hickory shafts on which he had
built up his game began to go he could find
none of the old quality, and so took to
steel. It is quite true that golf has eaten
up most of the prime-quality hickory in
the world, but America claims that a
replanting policy in progress for some
time will remedy this. Admittedly the
good wooden shaft has virtues that the
best steel gadgets cannot equal. Players
who rushed the steel at first have gone
back to the old love, even if the quality
is not what it was.
* *
“Sandringham”: The Australian women
golfers have drawn up their pro-
gramme for the visit of the English girls,
but will not make it public until it has
been confirmed by the English and State
Unions. It is announced, however, that
no matches will be played outside the
capital cities, though there will be one
at Canberra. The Englishwomen reach
Australia on August 13, and leave for
M.L. six weeks later. They will play
in the Australian championships from
August 26 to September 7, and tackle
Australia on September 5.
Racquet and Bawl
“Rev. Knucklebone”: The draw for
the Davis Cup has produced surprising
results. Australia, France, Germany and
Italy, four of the toughest propositions,
are in the lower half with M.L., which
meets Australia in the first match in Eng-
land. Beating M.L., as seems likely, Aus-
tralia must tackle France and then the
winner of the Germany-Italy match, in
each case playing on European courts.
In the first half Czecho-Slovakia meets
Yugoslavia, and Japan encounters Hol-
land. Poland and South Africa have
the byes. In the American zone China
plays U.S.A., and Mexico Cuba. Brazil
and Uruguay fight it out for the Spiggot-
ties.
The Australians have a tough job
ahead, but have this advantage, that after
the M.L. match all their games will be
on hard courts until America is met in
England on grass, if our men get so far.
Last year there were changes from grass
to hard and back to grass.
Of course there have been complaints.
The N.S.W. tennis heads have furiously
demanded a revision of the arrangements
in Europe, especially the jambing up of
the D.C. fixtures, the French champion-
ships and Wimbledon, all of which have
to be settled in two and a half months.
There is room for a real growl over the
easy spin enjoyed by the Americans. After
a cakewalk win in their own zone the
Yanks have only to travel to England
and indulge in practice on the grass
courts until the winner of the European
zone is rushed from the hard courts to
meet the Americans in the inter-zone
final.

“Top Spin”; Wallis Myers warns
Crawford, Perry and co. to beware of
Japan. He rates Nippon as having a
stronger team than any other challenger,
and is particularly sweet on Yamagishi,
whom he places as likely to outvie Satoh.
Britain’s chances of keeping the mug

CHEVROLET "KNEE-ACTION" SUSPENSION TURNS
BYWAYS INTO HIGHWAYS
THE RIDE-O-GRAPH PROVES IT!
M
The action of a man's knees as he ascends
a flight of stairs is very similar to the "knee-
action" suspension found on all Master
Chevrolets as the car travels over rough
surfaces. In both cases the body maintains
a relatively even plane.
SWSSJ3
T'he top turn at right shows the
shocks to driver recorded by the
Ride-o-graph over a stretch of
average rough road in a car with
ordinary springing. The bottom
graph shows how the driver is
protected against these shocks and
vibrations by Master Chevrolet’s
“Knee-Action" suspension.
Chevrolet “Knee-Action” permits higher average speeds over rough roads in perfect comfort and safety.
Chevrolet “Knee-Action” gives positively shockless steering under all road conditions.
Chevrolet “Knee-Action” springs never squeak . . . they operate in a bath of oil.
Chevrolet “Knee-Action” suspension has to be experienced to be appreciated. Take only a five mile drive in a
Master Chevrolet and prove its numerous qualities to your own satisfaction.
Extract from Automobile Engineer: The main impression gathered at the Paris Salon this year was that the tendencies evident during the last
two or three years have now become accepted practice. Independent wheel suspension and more or less stream-line coachwork are the rule.

Perry, in spite of the fact that both will
be playing in the challenge-round singles.

“Centre Court”; The first Davis Cup
round, in which Australia meets M.L.,
must be over by May 19. From then
until the challenge round begins on July
27 at Wimbledon five other rounds or
finals must be played, sandwiched in
with the French championships and the
All-England meeting. Play will alternate
from grass to hard courts. This calls
attention to the necessity for a uniform
type of court. Grass is used only in
Britain and parts of Australia and
America; elsewhere the hard court is in
universal use. The time is coming when
the hard court must supersede all others.
In no other way can absolutely fair con-
ditions for all-comers be assured.

“Old Stager”: Having seen my first
big tennis for a decade, and very little
of it in a quarter of a century, I find it
a stale game. With the exception of a
few freak double-handers and patent
volley strokes, it seems to me to have
degenerated into a contest of hard hit-
ting, back-line monotony. Before the
war there was much more variety, and
it would fill me with glee to see some of
these modern youngsters pitted in singles
against Home Rice—full of guile and
flashing all over the court, instead of
along the backline—or bewildered by
Parker at his top in the days when, as
a 42-year-old, he could make a ball land
on sixpence and corkscrew, skid or crawl
off with a nasty swerve at any angle or
pace he desired. Parker against Rice was
a thing to watch—speed and daring on
one side, cool, calculating finesse on the
other. I doubt if many sets would be
won against Parker’s slow serving in
these days, however much the 1934
champion thinks he has improved on the
old-timers.

“Snarleyow”: These tennis-players
se em to love each other as much as rival
pr i ma donnas. Consider Tilden on the
“How to Play Tennis,” made at
Wimbledon by Perry and Maskell. “The
Prancing Pierrot” is about the mildest
thing Bill has to say of the Briton. He
criticises Perry’s footwork, and there is

Miscellaneous
“Tape”: Tolan seized the chance of
his visit to Sydney with Robertson and
McFarlane—the races were unimport-
ant and there wasn’t much of a
crowd—to level some well-deserved
curses at the happy-go-lucky manner
in which Australian athletic meetings
are conducted. Running tracks as
understood in other countries are non-
existent, as are such matters as soft land-
ing pits for the high-jumpers and pole-
vaulters and special tracks for the run-up
to the take-off board in the broad-jump
events. Considering the dearth of in-
telligent coaching and the awful facili-
ties, Eddie reckons the Australian ath-
letic standards astonishingly high.
* * * *
“Fitzcray”; The centenary athletic
meeting in Melbourne provided a pro-
gramme in which distances in metres
were mixed up with others measured in
yards, with the result that comparisons
were often rendered difficult for the
ordinary spectator. Australia should
abandon the fool-idea of sticking to
the old-time measurements and take
up the metric system, both for track
and field events. The metric system has
been in use on the Continent since
Europe entered the field of athletics, and
the Olympiads recognise no other. One
of the last adherents to the old system,
America, officially abandoned it last year.

“Hotham”: In spite of that ominous
happening mentioned in B. 6/2/’35 the
first croquet Test between England and
Australia in Melbourne passed off with-
out any bodyline complications. Aus-
tralia won by four rubbers to two, scor-
ing 261 points to 200. England had
downed Maoriland by 316 points to 273.
* * * *
“Spike”: From time to time Aus-
tralia has tried to catch the eye of the
judges when the location of future
Olympic Games was being fixed. Hopes
have been entertained of hooking the
1940 fixture, which is to be allocated on
February 25. There are other candidates
who can also claim that they are due for
a turn. Italy, Japan and Finland lead
the list. The Japanese are urging that
1940 is the 2600th anniversary of the
foundation of their Empire.
* * * *
“Stretcher”: None of the accounts of
Beach’s career I have seen mentions the
suspicions held of his great little rival
Hanlan when Hanlan first paralysed the
sculling world with his bursts of speed.
It was the general opinion that Hanlan
used some outside device to increase his
pace, and electricity, then beginning to
be a popular mystery, was blamed,
though no trace of electrical gadgets was
ever found. Hanlan rather encouraged
the rumors as good publicity.

“Duckpond”: It is to be hoped that
the opening of the splendid Olympic
swimming-pool in Melbourne will wake
up the city Bumbles to the disgraceful
swimming facilities in Sydney, Many
N.S.W. country towns now have fine
pools built to Olympic requirements;
Enfield, a far-out Sydney suburb, also
boasts a good one. The official State
baths are the dirty tidal inlet in Woolloo-
mooloo which collects filth from the
shipping at the near-by wharves. Our
Japanese visitors could not conceal their
surprised disgust when they saw the place
they were expected to show in, and many
another visitor from overseas has regis-
tered disapproval of the insanitary water-
hole. Apart from all that, it has to be
faked-up to meet championship and
Olympic requirements, and at low tide
will hardly float the competitors in a
tiny tots’ race at the shallow end.

“Te Kuiti”: Writing in a Sydney paper
on the subject of the falling-off of the
standard of Maori football someone
revives the mistaken notion that the
“Native” team of 1888 consisted entirely
of Maoris. Ten at least of the 28 mem-
bers were whites, among them being Mc-
Causland, who afterwards played for
N.S.W. against Queensland, and was for
years a bank manager in Sydney. We are
to see a Maori team in Australia this
coming season, the first since 1923, and
will be able to judge for ourselves. Cer-
tainly fewer full-blooded Maoris seem to
catch the All-Black sides than was the
case a few years ago.

Will the Exchange Rate Rise?
The overseas trade return to Dec. 31
shows that we are importing this year
at a rate in keeping with last year’s in-
come, that the credits established in
London when wool was averaging 16d.
are not yet exhausted, that we are
still deriving some kick from last season’s
heartening but short-lived recovery.
Wool is now around 9d., and the
volume of sales is behind last year’s ;
the trade balance reflects both these
things. In the first half of 1933-34 we
sent overseas wool valued at £32,458,000
sterling; from July 1 to Dec. 31 our
shipments were down to £16,853,000.
Our total commodity exports (butter,
beef, wheat and sugar moved up a bit;
dried fruits, wine and metals fell away)
were £10,716,000 (stg.) lighter. Imports
were up £8,298,000, and the commodity
balance in our favor was £19,014,000
worse at £1,164,000. Including gold
shipments, which despite all the Stock
Exchange activity improved only
£600,000, the favorable balance was
£4,780,000.
So far we have gone on blissfully un-
perturbed about these things. Excepting
those concerns directly interested in
primary industries, Stock Exchanges now
value leading investment stocks at a
much higher figure than in January,
1934, when wool prices mounted to the
highest point since slump hit us. Because
there has been no immediate shortage
of funds in London —there was a com-
fortable balance left after paying interest
and all other commitments at June 30,
1934—the tariff has been lowered rather
than raised, and imports have been en-
couraged rather than restricted. Cus-
toms revenue is at present on a scale
very gratifying to the Federal Treasury.
Including gold shipments, we have so
far this year established a balance of less
than £5,000,000 (stg.) overseas. Our
interest bill is something like £26,000,000
p.a. If oiir trade figures are no more
favorable in the second half of this year,
we shall face the next term with a deficit
that our reserves in London may not
cover, and overseas borrowing may be
necessary.
We are not paying our way on cur-
rent trade. Customs Minister White says
there is “no immediate cause for alarm”:
“the increased volume of imports was
partly due to last year’s high wool prices,
and the position will automatically adjust
itself,”
The position will not necessarily adjust
itself, except through a rising exchange
rate. Importers, so long as they can
bring what they want into the country
at saleable prices, will continue to im-
port —provided the purchasing power
is here. The income of land men has
certainly been reduced, and the effect
must, unfortunately, spread to other sec-
tions of the community. But many com-
mercial houses consider the danger of a
rise in the exchange so near that they
are quietly buying up London money
at £125 Australian. They can scarcely
lose on such a policy unless wool prices
stage a miraculous comeback.
The monthly averages of wool prices
in all Commonwealth centres, July to
January inclusive, have been 15.7 d., 11.1 d.,
8.9 d., 9.6 d., 10d., 9.5 d. and lOd. per
pound respectively. The average for the
seven months has been 9.8 d. a pound, as
against 16d. in 1933-34 and B.Bd. in
1932-33.

“A deplorable feature of the specta-
cular rise and fall in the Yellowdine
group is the excessive gambling in shares
which has taken place both here and in
Australia”—that is the opinion of
London “Daily Telegraph’s” financial
editor. Despite all this gambling West-
ralia’s gold yield moved up only £621,000
(Aust.) last year. What Australia wants
is less gambling and more energetic work
irt its mining industry.
* * * *
Australian gold production for 1934 is
tentatively put at £7,500,000 (Aust.), an
increase of £1,094,000 compared with
1933. Of the improvement, Westralia
accounted for £621,000, Queensland
£244,000, Vic. £148,000 and N. S. Wales
£Bl,OOO.
* * * *
The world’s visible gold reserves, ex-
cluding Russia, increased £180,000,000
during 1934. Those countries which had
large quantities of gold (such as U.S.A.
and France) again added largely to their
stocks. Countries fighting to keep on the
GOLFING GARDENER : “Shovel or mattock, son?"
gold standard — e.g., Italy and Germany
—suffered further heavy withdrawals.
The London price of the yellow metal
continues high, being around the £7 2s.
mark at the week-end. This in spite of
the strengthening of the dollar in relation
to the pound.
* * * *
Though our 1934 dried-fruit crop is
practically all sold —the new season’s
fruit, it is anticipated, will arrive in Lon-
don with the market clear of Australian
stocks —the value of currants and raisins
exported for the six months ended
December was £570,000 lower at
£620,000. Still, the A.D.F.A. considers
the outlook encouraging—in 1933 prices
were given a lift by a poor crop in Spain.
The dried-fruit industry has grown to a
position of real importance in Australia
over the last dozen years.
* * * *
The Sydney concern popularly known
as “D.J.’s” has opened a new wing to its
Marlborough-street factory, which houses
18 different types of industry. There are
1016 hands employed, and the wages
bill is £102,365 a year. Output last year
was valued at £600,000, including bath-
ing costumes processed from the raw
wool. About 3000 yards of woven and
knitted goods is turned out each week.
David Jones is not likely to be heard
wailing about tariffs nowadays, as was
the custom of most softgoods merchants
10 or 20 years back.
* * * *
Some motorists who cross Sydney
Harbor Bridge regularly are asking why
they can’t be given season tickets —at a
reduced rate, of course. Most people
who use the bridge consistently live on
the North Shore, and already pay bridge
taxes ; the bridge may be the only means
of getting to their place of business.
Some sort of concession should be
granted to regular users, even if only a
cut of 20 p.c. on, say, a book of 30
tickets which had to be used during a
specified month.
* * * *
Gas Drillers commenced boring for
natural gas on the banks of the Nepean,
near Penrith (N.S.W.), on February 7.
It is estimated that 600 ft. of Hawkesbury
sandstone will have to be passed through,
then 1500 ft. to 2000 ft. of shales, etc.,
before the coal measures containing pay-
able gas are likely to be found.
Dry gas, if encountered, could be used
as coal gas; wet gas would also yield
petroleum. The bore-site is above what
is known as the Mulgoa dome, a peculiar
folding in the rocks noted as long ago as
1896 by Professor David.
* * * *
From the inception of the sales tax the
Commonwealth Taxation Department has
made no distinction between new and
second-hand goods. The High Court has
overruled this “ruling,” its unanimous
opinion being that second-hand goods
are not liable to tax. Under Section 26
of the Act, which provides that the Com-
missioner may refund taxes unjustly
levied, a man applied for a return of
what he had overpaid on second-hand
goods. He was informed that from the
date of the Court’s judgment no further
tax would be demanded, but that any-
thing paid before Dec. 12, 1934, cannot
be refunded!
* * * *
Shipbuilding activity during 1934 was
nearly double that of 1933. Total ton-
nage launched for the year was 967,419,
of which Britain’s proportion, helped by
the completion of the Queen Mary, was
47.5 p.c. The change from coal to oil
grows more pronounced ; motor vessels
aggregated 563,601 tons, steamers 391,176
tons and oil-tankers 198,337 tons.
* * * *
A bill to amend the Navigation Act is
again to be brought forward by the
Federal Ministry. The previous Gov-
ernment went to the country before the
measure, which provided for the carriage
of passengers by overseas ships between
ports not connected by railway, could be
passed. Tasmania is principally con-
cerned. Only tourist passengers will be
permitted to travel in overseas vessels
between the ports specified.
* * *
Bricks and tiles in Sydney have gone up
in price appreciably since 1934, the
former from about 38s. to 50s. a thou-
sand, and the latter about p.c. Build-
ing men estimate a rise of 15 p.c. in the
cost of erecting houses. Brick manufac-
turers say that old prices were uneco-
nomic, and that even the new rate is
below that of Melbourne (60s. a thou-
sand), Brisbane (755.) and Auckland (955.).
'l s •i'
The London investment market, where
money has been dirt-cheap for months,
is jibbing at the low rates of interest
offered on gilt-edged securities. Not
only was the Australian conversion loan
affected ; British loans are far from being
as popular as they were a couple
of months back, when Consols notched
new record levels. The course of interest
rates needs watching by investors. If
rates widen, shares, under present con-
ditions, are almost certain to weaken.
The splendid recovery in earnings last
year can scarcely be maintained with
wool and wheat at their present levels.
* * *
Due partly to the increase in building
and mining activity there is a shortage
of galvanised-iron in Australia. The
position was accentuated by the strike at
Lysaght’s Newcastle works, where there
was a loss in output of about 9000 tons.
Permission has been granted for the im-
portation of 10,000 tons of galvanised-iron
to fill the gap ; according to Customs
Minister White, a new Australian co.
which was to have started manufacturing
last year will not be ready for produc-
tion for some weeks. Lysaght’s plant
capacity is expected to increase from
80,000 to 100,000 tons p.a. in the near
future.

Germany, home of lager and pilsener,
is being made a dumping-ground for
Japanese beer. Scandalised German
brewers say they can’t buy the bottles,
let alone fill them, at the Japanese prices.
Germany’s beer exports have been
practically halved in two years, while
Japan has risen to second place among
the world’s exporters, Britain retaining
first place.

“G.”: Psychists will claim a clinching
triumph for their faith in a Toorak
(Melbourne) incident the other day. The
premonition of the bride’s sister at a wed-
ding breakfast led to a sudden dash in
a car to the house of the mother, where
a burglar was discovered in the act of
breaking in. He got clean away, without
loot, but certainly would have played
havoc with the presents had the lady not
felt that overwhelming feeling that some-
thing was wrong. The simple explanation
of all these premonitions which come off
is that there are ninety and nine which
don’t.
* * * *
“Curragh”: When they were putting
down the tram rails in one of Melbourne’s
biggest tramway depots they ignored the
durable qualities of jarrah and bedded
the rails on imported Oregon, of all
timbers. The Oregon, now rotten, has been
replaced by jarrah. Apparently Mel-
bourne authorities have a deep-rooted
contempt for Australian timbers; wit-
ness the Centenary Council’s use of im-
ported softwoods for the framework of
their pylons on Prince’s Bridge.


THE OTHER
FELLOW'S
MIND.
Lang Is Right
Well, he spoke the truth for once when
he said in the N.S.W. Assembly that
soldier-settlement had proved a failure
owing to extortionate prices demanded
and inferior land offered by land-owners.
In my case the stay-at-home son of the
vendor was a member of the local com-
mittee. In relieving the old man of a
white elephant he enabled his sire to
pose as a patriot by supporting the win-
the-war loans with the cheque he got.
The interest is now comfortably sustain-
ing the family, while the Digger and his
family are scratching for an existence.—
Sett (N.S.W.).
Election Eyewash
The Bulletin chides Governments for
spending money on “public works that
absorb the unemployed so briefly and
leave so much taxation in their train.”
You seem to think that Governments
should receive value for the cash thus
spent. Wrong ; they merely want votes.
If a relief job on dole wages can keep a
man chipping grass out of gutters for two
weeks out of six, that man can be tri-
umphantly written off the official un-
employed list. It makes good election
eyewash.—J. B. (N.S.W.).
Women as Politicians
In my callow days I was an enthusias-
tic advocate of women taking part in
public life, but 20 years’ experience in
Parliament disillusionised me. Not one
woman in a hundred is capable of taking
an intelligent interest in politics. The
hundredth one is the abnormally mascu-
line type, and even she cannot get away
from the limitations imposed by sex.
To me it was a painful and depress-
ing experience to address a women’s
political organisation. The rows of
faces were blank, and I was conscious
all the time that not one of the crowd
was following with any degree of com-
prehension what was being said. The
rounding up of uninterested female
voters to the polling-booths is one of
the greatest farces of these alleged demo-
cratic days; without the voting ticket
thrust into their hands the great bulk
of them would have only the faintest
idea of what they were expected to do.
I am ready to wager more than I can
afford that nine-tenths of the spoiled
ballot papers are marked by women.
The female members of Parliament I
have known would have been far better
occupied carrying out their natural voca-
tion of looking after a home. — Old
Hand (Vic.).
Protect the Police!
The police of every city in the Com-
monwealth waste no inconsiderable time
investigating allegations of crimes that
have never been committed. In the
majority of such cases, the complainants
have lost not their own money but money
entrusted to them by somebody else, and
invent more or less sensational stories of
armed bandits to cover their own dis-
honesty. Others are invented by men
who desire to conceal from wives and
other interested people the fact that they
have “blewed” their wages. Others again
are just hysterical sensationalists who
want their names in the papers and tell
stories of heroic fights against mighty
odds to thrill acquaintances.
All three varieties are public nuisances
and should be dealt with in such a
manner as to deter imitators. While
policemen and detectives are employed
blowing out wild yarns genuine crimes
are committed. — Spike (Vic.).
Support for Weaver
Weaver’s idea of requiring every
newly-registered N.S.W. medical graduate
to do 12 months’ hospital practice be-
fore he sets up for himself or buys a
practice puts him into the very small and
select class of Ministers of Health who
are of some real use. “Myself when
young did,” as Omar chattily remarks,
a lot of things I shudder at to-day. I
knew too much, and I’d have done even
worse things but for a resident-hospital
job under a kindly but quite forceful
honorary M.O. of the family-doctor
type. He taught me that which is not
taught in a medical course —or wasn’t
then: the doctrine of wait and see and
think. Especially think.
The old system of apprenticeship had
real value in this way. Indeed, a modi-
fied form of apprenticeship prior to
graduation would supply a much-needed
want in medical education. — Kwakprak
(Q.).
Ministers and Public Servants
For nearly 20 years I was in the public
service. I entered it in middle life, and,
not having been broken-in to regulations,
I chafed a good deal at first. I lived to
be thankful that I had not been allowed
to show my ignorance.
“What’s the matter with you? Mabel’s coming in."
"Oh, I feel such a goat ! My costume complies with the regulations"
I served under seven Ministers whose
terms ranged from one year to five years.
Here is the list:
(1) A farmer of the old school who had
graduated from manual labor.
(2) A newspaper-owner and editor ; he
governed well because he knew something.
(3) A retired bookseller who got most
of his criticism of his officers from his
club and the progress associations of his
electorate.
(4) A head (retired) of a big commercial
firm. He called us together and said “I
must trust you, gentlemen. Don’t let me
down, or you will hear about it.” A good
Minister.
(5) Another farmer, also of the old
school, and a whale to work. He read
every report sent in, and the marginal
notes made many of us weepy. It didn’t
matter how technical the thing was; we
had to report on our own report —plus
marginal notes.
(6) A brainy man who had been a ship’s
painter. Autocratic, but a born politician.
(7) A cattleman who was not ashamed
to say that he didn’t know everything.
By what we learned from officers who
came from other States our Ministers
were above the average in their States.
But they did not shine by comparison
with their advisers. Some of the heads
of the technical branches were famous
abroad, and all were qualified men. As
for the Under-Secretaries and other
officers, they all had to pass an
examination before entering the service.
Only one of the Ministers I knew could
have passed it.
One section of our Ministers got its
inspiration from Chambers of Commerce
and the like; the other section from
shearing-shed resolutions and the Trades
Hall. There was not much to choose be-
tween them as far as ignorance went. —
W.G. B. (Q.).
No Stockings
Why all this fuss about girls going
without stockings? I see dozens every
day outside Victorian towns. Girls and
women milk in the winter in pants and
rubber boots ; in summer in pants and
shoes, but no stockings. Fruitgrowers’
wives and daughters pick and pack bare-
legged.
I called on a Cheltenham poultry-
farmer expecting to see the house-
mistress, a woman about 50. Instead,
there came to the door her daughter,
an attractive vision in shoes, white
shorts and cream blouse; no more.
The shorts were high and loose, the
blouse low and tight. The rest of her
was a beautiful sunburnt brown. That
wasn’t put on in a day, or at the beach
either —just mucking around the fowl-
yards. And she carried on, as it was
her daily habit. Anyhow, what’s wrong
with it? It suited her, and I had no ob-
jections.
As for scanty bathing costumes, I
know four girls who, after finishing milk-
ing 40 cows in the evening, mount their
ponies and ride barebacked to the Yarra,
a mile away, taking towels but no
bathers. There they meet other girls,
have a swim, then ride home to supper.
That’s in the summer ; in the winter they
follow the hounds —that and an occa-
sional dance are their recreations. Not
one has ever seen a movie or talkie,—
Hawker (Vic.).
Another Unemployed Settler
A middle-aged married man with three
young children, I lost my job three years
ago. I paid a deposit on a bit of land
midway between Sydney and Newcastle,
built a shack, cleared a small patch for
vegetables and bought laying hens. The
money gave out, and I had to apply for
relief work. It was granted after a long
delay, during which we nearly starved.
With what I earn in this way and 10s.
a week child endowment, we keep our-
selves in food, having our own vegetables
and eggs. My thrifty wife and I have
cleared about two acres of bushland, and
grow small crops when we can save a
few shillings for seed and fertiliser —in-
dispensable in this locality. But we have
no title to the land, and we cannot raise
a loan from the Unemployment Relief
Council; and we are also outside the
Farmers’ Relief Act. Were the Govern-
ment to take over our land and advance
us enough to buy fencing material, seed
and fertiliser it would give us the neces-
sary start, and in six months relieve the
State of our upkeep. As it is, the Gov-
eminent pays married men £lOO a year
or so to build roads indifferently.
So far, our politicians have treated un-
employment as merely a temporary diffi-
culty, but after five years it should now
be obvious that it is here to stay. —
A. U. S. (N.S.W.).
Abos. and Aliens
The Australian abo. is a long time com-
ing into his own; had he been better
able to impress his fighting strength on
his conquerors, like the American Indian
and the Maori, he might have been in
a different position to-day.
While the northern Tacky has no vote,
and is without other rights of citizenship,
the mixed progeny of, say, an Asiatic
father and a colored mother, if born in
Australia, in due course becomes a full
Australian citizen! That’s one of the
things that get Tacky puzzled. His wife
likewise has no rights ; but the colored
lady of Chinatown or Yokohama-street
can record her vote and collect the
maternity bonus. — Condah (Vic.).
Labor’s Conflict with Science
That London jeweller who has suc-
ceeded, after 45 years of experimentation,
in turning out artificial diamonds capable
of fulfilling all tests will wreak a revolution
among the diamond-mines —shareholders
and workers alike. Hundreds of capi-
talists will be ruined, and scores of thou-
sands of laborers will be workless. Simi-
larly, if Germany should contrive to pro-
duce a perfect wollstra —equal to genuine
wool in every respect—it will deal
a more serious blow to Australia than it
did by means of war.
The anomaly is that these inventions
all add to the sum of human comfort
and world wealth. If Germany —and the
rest of the world—can produce artificial
wool indistinguishable from real wool at
half the price—that is, half the expendi-
ture of labor—humanity will be made
a valuable present. People will be able
to obtain their clothes at 50 p.c. of what
they now pay, and a vast number of men
now engaged in producing wool will be
released to perform other work, useful
or enjoyable for the whole community.
The trouble is that to-day there exists no
machinery to provide for their re-em-
ployment in any other industry.—M. G.
(Vic.).
Psychology of the Tourist
A luxury yacht blew into Sydney last
week; the passengers strolled ashore,
gave Sydney the once-over in one day
and departed for Maoriland the next.
Ordinary human curiosity would prompt
any normal individual to scrutinise a
strange place as fully as possible, even
though the place appeared hateful to
him. Dante wasn’t satisfied to do hell
in one day. He went over it thoroughly.
Years ago I went to England on a mail-
boat, and, passing between Italy and
Sicily—the most picturesque and drama-
tic scene of this or any ocean voyage —a
number of the idle rich ostentatiously
drew up their deck chairs under the awn-
ing, where they could see nothing, and
read novels through the whole passing.
They were of too fine a clay to be
interested in things like scenery. Dur-
ing one of my trips across the Indian
Ocean, an enthusiastic woman rushed up
to a newly-made Australian knight and
cried: “Oh, Sir Georgius Midas, did you
see that wonderful sunset this evening?”
The titled one drew himself up with
pride and observed contemptuously: “I
believe my wife’s maid did.” Sunsets
apparently were just cheap things which
Nature had provided to entertain the
lower orders.
Still, it is not all affectation. I have
made the Prince’s Highway trip between
Sydney and Melbourne four or five
times. I spent from three to five days
on the journey, and feel ashamed to
admit it, for it is such a wonderful ex-
perience that anybody who can afford
the time should never think of spending
less than a fortnight, motoring from
beauty spot to beauty spot and drinking
them all in. Yet all my acquaintances
who have covered the same route start
by boasting how they had cut down their
previous record by 18 minutes, covering
the distance in a day and 18 hours or
something of the sort. They did not
profess contempt of natural beauty.
They were speed addicts, and the only
point of interest was the condition of
the road, which would assist or retard
their knocking a few seconds off the
record. The Prince’s Highway was not
an avenue of beauty ; it was just a speed-
way.-

A Policy for the Territory
The first essential in dealing with the
Northern Territory is to get down to
tin tacks. All sorts of opinions have been
expressed about it. Most are wrong.
One thing is uniform in the N.T. —the
Territorian. Mainly, he lives in an iron
shanty, scarcely seeing money from year’s
end to year’s end, cheerful and full of
faith. A few make enough money to
come south once in a while or to send
their families south. They are the salt of
the earth —the same brand of humanity
that pushed out into western N.S.W. and
Queensland in the early days. I believe
Territorians can govern themselves better
than any city politician can. Therefore,
the first plank in an N.T. policy is “The
Territory for Territorians.” At present,
they have not even one vote in any Par-
liament, though they bravely hold on to
one-sixth of Australia under siege con-
ditions.
The next plank is to survey the re-
sources of this vast slice of varied coun-
try. lam in treaty with big patriotic in-
terests already to help me do this, and
there seem to me to be three main
channels of inquiry. There is the pastoral
industry; we know already that there is
a small kingdom of Mitchell grass coun-
try—the Barkly, Victoria River and some
other districts. This has been proved as
cattle country. It needs expert examina-
tion under local supervision to see exactly
the best way to handle it, and at the same
time use it to increase population. Its
sub-artesian area must be closely mapped.
Its carrying capacity needs sectionally
estimating. That is a job for some man
with pastoral sympathies and a know-
ledge of land administration and markets
—Payne, of the Queensland Land Board,
is such a man.
The surface of most Territory mining
fields has been thoroughly raked over,
but there is still a lot of gold. Most of
it is in small reefs and leaders capable of
being worked by parties, though there are
very few company propositions in sight.
The Federal Government could help to
put dozens of these little parties on the
deposits which abound. But more is
needed —examination of the area by the
world-type mining engineer-geologist, of
the highest standard obtainable. Such
men are hard to get in Australia, and
Governments shy off them because their
fees are generally high. Nobody cavils
at paying the lawyer a big fee. Why not
the men whose knowledge is likely to
add hundreds of thousands to the wealth
of the country? They could tell us with
the aid of the diamond-drill what the pos-
sibilities of deep mining are. The deep
country never has been explored, but 1
believe that it is worth thorough prospect.
With such a policy must go the wiping
out of gambling on northern resources.
If half the money which turns over on
the Stock Exchanges in speculation in
North Australian and New Guinea mines
went into exploration and development,
shareholders would be better off and the
mining industry would flourish. There
are special dangers in speculation when
the Government decides to subsidise
mining.
Lastly, there are the industries which
are little developed. The conditionsi
under which the struggling peanut-
grower of the Daly, the tin-gouger, the
tobacco man, the few small farmers live
would shock the conscience of the South
if it knew. All these suffer from lack
of communication, as does everybody
else in the North, and from high freights.
I believe there are industries which could
be initiated which could surmount those
difficulties. Production of power-alcohol
from crops, for instance, which has
begun to develop on the Atherton, and
which does not need very large invest-
ments of capital.
Meantime we need air development.
There is not a settler who would not
struggle to help himself get air com-
munication in the monsoon country,
which only aerial travel can reach at
present in. the wet season. The mistakes
which have so far been made show how
much local knowledge counts.
We need at once a committee of Ter-
ritorians —not of absentees with specu-
lative interests —to expand these plans.

“Lapadine”; “No. 2 Bore” makes dis-
paraging remarks (B. 23 /1 / ’35) on the
air mail for Daly Waters being car-

nearly everything in the N.T. seems to
be done in the same slack way.

years, my opinion is that S.A. gave the
Far North much better treatment than
the Commonwealth has done. The two
members allotted to the country had
votes and did a great deal of good for
their constituency ; whereas the solitary
representative in the House nowadays
has no vote.

“Larraba”: When the first N.T. settle-
ment was transferred from Escape Cliffs
to Darwin, the town-site had to be cut out
of an immense bamboo jungle ( Bambusa
arundinacea). The King of the ’Skeeters
lived in Darwin, and his armies were
numerous as sea sand and savage as hor-
nets. They killed cage birds and fowls.
Dogs had to get a fitful sleep with their
paws over their eyes and their tails well
tucked in. The blacks went into smoke
after sundown, and banked-up fires
smouldered in the streets for the relief
of the horses. In the ’nineties all the
Darwin bamboo seeded and died, and it
has never been resurrected. According
to Malays, all related bamboos in other
countries seeded and died at the same
time. The bamboo and the baobab are
probably exotic, and some research work
concerning their Australian invasion
might throw a light on anthropology.
“Australia Jane's” Budget
The Nevile Wilkinsons and the Wick-
low Earl arrived so quietly in Brisbane
that they almost might have been travel-
ling incog. The first sightseeing the
visitors did was on Tambourine Moun-
tain. Titania’s Palace will open in Bris-
bane as soon as the Melbourne season is
over.
Mrs. T. J. Ryan spent a few days in
Brisbane with daughter Jill and new
son-in-law Raymond Lambert. Jill was
very lavishly entertained while she
was in Brisbane. She and her husband
have left for Melbourne again, but a
concert tour of the North is being con-
sidered.
Decima Eleanor Hazard, eldest daugh-
ter of the R. J. Hazards, of Too-
woomba, has an altar date with Richard
Henry Sutton, second son of A. H.
Sutton, of Strathmay station, Dubbo,
N.S.W.
Vena Yates, of Toowoomba, youngest
daughter of Mrs. J. M. Yates, is engaged
to Vernon Langford, only son of the late
P. V. Langford, of Auckland, and Mrs.
C. D. Bunce, of Sydney.
Another wedding in the Grant family
—the third in four months! Donald
Grant is to marry Beverley Wymond on
February 18. Mrs. W. Grant was to have
given a big party for the bride-elect,
but ’flu put a stop to it.
The Frank Ridgways, of Perth, are
in Brisbane. Mrs. Ridgway is an ardent
worker for the R.S.P.C.A. and the Park-
ville Orphan Home.
Brisbane Women’s College will cele-
brate its 21st birthday by a party on
March 15, with a graduates’ dinner next
evening. Freda Bage has been principal
of the college ever since its foundation.
One of the kindest of women passed
in Lorna Ethel Kibble, the eldest
daughter of the late J. N. Hortons. After
her marriage she lived for some years in
Japan, but latterly dwelt in Brisbane.
Two old Downs families were linked
by the wedding of Jean McDougall,
daughter of the late Alpin McDougall,
of Toowoomba, and Mrs. McDougall, of
Sydney, to Billy Newman, of St. Athans,
Wyreema, only son of the late George
Newman and of Mrs. Newman, one
of Australia’s greatest dairy-stock breed-
ers. Southport school chapel was
the setting, and Bishop Dixon tied
the knot. The bride, given away by
her cousin, Mai McDougall, of Dalveen,
wore a gown of banana satin and a
lovely old Limerick lace veil, lent by her
aunt, Mrs. Harry Gordon. Joyce God-
sail, in powder-blue Chantilly lace,
’maided, and Alan McDougall was best
man. Followers of the sport of kings
will need no reminder of the many good
racehorses that have come from the Mc-
Dougall stables at Lyndhurst.
Nancy Barrow has joined the great
flit to Europe. Doris Heindorff gave a
gay little au revoir party at Rowe’s.
Edna Hancock’s wedding to Harry
Noble takes place at the City Taber-
nacle in March. Her sister, pretty Mrs.
Duncan McWhirter, is to be matron of
honor, and Marion Allom bridesmaid.
Mr. and Mrs. F. Z. Eager will be pas-
sengers to the U.S.A. by the Monterey
on May 1. They will be away for several
months, and will visit Chicago, New
York and other centres. Part of the time
they will be the guests of Mr. Eager’s
mother.
Gladys Carter, who is down from
Home Hill, N.Q., was the guest of honor
at a bridge party at the Bellevue. God-
frey Cox was the host, and Ruby Massey
helped him tb re-
receive and entertain
the crowd.
Mrs. Reg Quilty,
who usually does all
her travelling by
’plane, is going back
to Normanton by
the Ormiston this
time. She has been
visiting Sydney and
Melbourne.

Carty, who has been

of Kedron.
Brisbane’s musical
world got a pleasant
shock when it learnt
that Leonard Fran-
cis, under whose
baton numerous
choirs have whooped
their way to victory,
had joined the Benedicts. His bride was
Miss W. Dunoon, a pupil, and a leading
member of the Blackstone-Ipswich Cam-
brian Choir. The news was broken at a
party at the National Hotel which had
been arranged to bid Mr. Francis au
revoir before he left for England. The
knot-tying was done very quietly at St.
Andrew’s Church, Indooroopilly, by
Rev. Roy St. George, and the bride’s
brother-in-law, Mr. W. Ross, gave her
away.
Ronald Forbes Reid, eldest son of the
late Mr. and Mrs. Alec Reid, of Clay-
field, was married on Feb. 6 to Mary
Anderson, of Maryborough. Dr. G. P.
Dickson gave away the bride, who had
no bridesmaids. Dr. Dickson and Mrs.
R. Short were witnesses.

Booklet from “Bulletin” Sydney.
A WOMAN'S
LETTER
Martin-place is losing its truncated
look. It now sweeps up impressively
from George-street to Phillip-street, its
boundary St. Stephen’s kirk. Like some
weatherbeaten prophet stands the kirk,
its spire, like an upflung hand, pointing
to heaven. Mammon also has his temples
near by, and banks here and there lure
the thrifty to lay up a bit of treasure on
this earth. The handsomest facade is
worn by the Commonwealth Savings
Bank in the newly-opened roadway be-
tween Castlereagh and Elizabeth streets.
The Fellowship of Australian Writers
has decided to let out the clutch and rip
into its new year with the throttle
open. To begin with it’s running an
Authors’ Week, and inviting a novelist
from the south to come to Sydney as the
Fellows’ guest. This, of course, will
mean a lunch extraordinary. The week
will be embellished with an exhibition
and a pageant—both to be held in the
Blaxland Galleries. The pageant will
feature the evolution of Australian litera-
ture, and will be written and produced
by John Gould, with Jeanie Ranken as
co-conspirator. There will be lectures in
the schools and on the air, and the whole
will rocket to a ball, so that the curious
who have seen their authors only in print
can glimpse them in the glory of boiled
shirts and backless frocks.
A rose of sentiment will be dropped on
the graves of the dead, but the real job
of the week is to help pluck the thorns
from the path of Australia’s living writ-
ers. Literature is the Cinderella of the
arts in Australia; for it there are no
travelling scholarships, and the only per-
manent literary prize worth having is
that founded in the name of S. H. Prior,
the late editor and managing director of
The Bulletin. It was he who, seeing
that Australian writers were neglecting
the novel, spurred their interest by
offering £l7OO in prizes; since then
novels have burst into bloom in every
corner of the land. June next is the
closing month for the Prior Memorial
novel. Now, Cinderella, put your best
foot forward!
Bedford Osborne, whose engagement
to Mollie Wolfcarius was announced last
week, is the only son of Mrs. Jimmy
Osborne, whose witty and charming
husband died last year. Bedford doesn’t
look like the typical Osborne man, being
tall and somewhat film-starish as regards
his features. He takes after his mother,
who was lovely Maud Jeffries, an actress
who edified and delighted the world in
such dramas as “The Sign of the Cross”
in the pre-movie era,
Bedford was educated at Melbourne
Grammar. He rowed in the Grammar
eight nine years ago. After leaving
school he settled down on the family
property Bowylie, near Gundaroo ; joined
the Union Club, which was one of the
favorite Sydney haunts of his father;
and, except for an occasional hour there,
and a jaunt now and then to Palm Beach,
stuck solidly to work. He has only en-
joyed one long holiday in his strenuous
life so far—a trip to London via America,
which enabled him to meet his mother’s
people in the States, and his grandmother,
Mrs. Pat Osborne, and other Anglicised
members of the clan in England.
Edwin Ryrie, who died in London
the other day, was best known to his
friends as a devoted father. He idol-
ised his two beautiful daughters, and his
frank delight at their brilliant mar-
riages and their happiness generally was
a rare spectacle these offhand days. He
lost one shortly after he went to settle
in London some years ago, and he never
got over the shock. His wife —a Hamil-
ton Osborne —died in London before he
arrived there.
Edwin Ryrie was an odd combination.
A son of David Ryrie, of Cooma, a
descendant of a soldier pioneer of the
very early days, and a cousin of the
“Old Brig.,” his natural affiliations
were with the pastoral life; and he
looked it. But there was a literary side
to his nature. He wrote propaganda for
one of the political parties for several
years, and was very good at the job, too,
and he published a couple of novels in
London which won high praise from the
critics. He served in the World War
with the R.F.A.
It is a pity the Cricket Association
couldn’t have cashed in on the gallery
that watched Stan McCabe commence
his matrimonial innings. The crowds
billowed and surged around St. Mary’s
Cathedral, and for once the ’groom col-
lected more eyes than the bride. She
was Edna May Linton, a slim Towns-
ville girl. Portrait by Falk.
The Australian cricket-selector “Chap-
pie” (E. A.) Dwyer squired Edna to the
altar, and following her silver-flecked,
tulle-misted whiteness stepped “Binkie”
Rice, of Prairie Vale station, Queens-
land, and Thora Tunney, of Grenfell, the
’groom’s home town. They were in
Lorelei-green georgette, and against its
soft pleatings trails of Cecil Brunner roses
and pink water-lilies swayed gently. The
cake, festive with green and gold and
decked with golf (Mrs. McCabe’s a
golfer) and cricket emblems, was cut at
the Pickwick Club, where the bride’s
mother hostessed in navy taffetas.
In 1927 a little company of Sydney
women banded together to bring about
a reduction of maternal and infantile
mortality. Since then they have preached
the gospel as expounded by Dr. Watson
Munro, who 40 years ago helped to
found the Crown-street Women’s Hos-
pital. However, the death-rate of young
mothers still mounts yearly into the hun-
dreds, and the National Council of
Women has decided to roll up its sleeves
and dash to the rescue.
Last week the council gathered to-
gether representatives of women’s organi-
sations to discuss a memorandum to
be forwarded to the Health Council
that meets in Canberra in March.
The two most important requests are for
increased opportunities for doctors and
nurses to study obstetrics, and for the
establishment in each State of at least one
model centre equipped for pathological
research. Grace Scobie, an enthusiastic
worker in the cause for seven years, was
among the hearty applauders of the meet-
ing’s decision. She and council president
Mrs. Bernard Muscio, Mrs. Edmond
Gates and possibly Sister Edna Shaw,
from the Crown-street Women’s Hospital,
will go as delegates to the council. Dr.
Constance D’Arcy has been invited to de-
liver the Anne McKenzie oration; she
has chosen for her subject Maternal Wel-
fare. All this, plus Priminster Lyons’s
sympathetic attitude (his wife’s influence
is suspected), should bring results.
Mrs. T. J. Ryan, who holds a re-
sponsible position for the Queensland
Government in Melbourne, was the guest
of honor at the Queenslanders’ weekly
luncheon. General Goddard presided,
Eira Boyd, a popular and philanthropic
Sydney girl, won’t be flustered if two
or three uninvited guests drop in to
dinner at her new home in Queensland.
Eira, who had been assistant-secretary of
the Queenslanders’ Association, was pre-
sented with a dinner service of 63 pieces
in Crown Derby china on the eve of her
marriage to Ken Webb, of Cremorne and
Brisbane. The Picton Lakes settlement,
too, for which she had worked energetic-
ally, gave her some pretties for the house.
The wedding was an afternoon affair,
and was blessed by St. Phillip’s on
Church Hill. Pale-blue silk crepe and a
wide felt hat of the same toning as her
frock formed the bridal raiment.
While the second Randolph Churchill
in the political line was saying good-bye
to his chances at the Wavertree by-
election, his mother was at Sydney
Zoo buying black swans. She arrived
in Port Jackson on the yacht Rosaura.
Its owner is Lord Moyne, and he is a
Guinness, so you can imagine that the
yacht is replete with comfort, if not
luxury. On board were Lady Broughton,
Captain and Mrs. E. O. Kellett (they
went off to America in the Monterey) and
Terence Phillip. The party has come from
England by way of the Mediterranean
and the Indian Ocean. They spent their
afternoon looking at wallabies, ’possums
and native bears in the Zoo, and also had
a close-up of the shark in the aquarium
pool. They spent the evening amid the
city’s mad whirl, and joined their ship,
lying off Neutral Bay, just before she
sailed, which she did that same night.
Will they write a book about us?
Busy and very happy, packing up in
her Bellevue Hill home, Mrs. Lavarack,
whose colonel has just been made
Chief of the, General Staff of Aus-
tralia’s army, faces the move to Mel-
bourne. The lady is a Melbournite,
one of the well-known Ochiltree family.
Her sons John and Peter are in
Melbourne, the first at Ormonde College
in his third year medicine, the second a
pilot in the R.A.A.F., so there should be
some popular tennis (it’s the lady’s favor-
ite game) parties at the Lavaracks’
southern home. A Raymond Sawyer
camera made the portrait.
The Lavaracks are known in all the
States. He is a Queenslander, and an
old Brisbane Grammar School pupil. His
father was a major of the northern State’s
militia; she was a Ballarat High girl.
For a while their home was at
the Military College, Duntroon. They
have twice been to England on service
matters, and these residences in the dog-
loving country no doubt did much to
foster the lady’s love of canines. She is
known as a successful breeder of cocker
spaniels. Both husband and wife are
tall and attractive, and they have a way
with them.
The Philharmonic Society is entering
on its golden jubilee, and at the annual
meeting last week the feeling was that
the old-established bit of musical Sydney
had weathered the storm. Supporters of
the “Phil.” can now test assured that the
“Messiah” and “Elijah” will continue to
roll and surge. In fact, as more members
have joined up, the volume should be
still mightier than of old. Edward Wilson
is once again president and Howard Carr
conductor.
Doreen Hordern dropped a surprise
into the family circle by cabling the news
of her engagement to an Englishman,
Oscar M. Peall, of Marlborough (Wilts.).
Doreen has been paying another of her
many visits to England, and it looks as
though she has decided to settle there.
She is the elder of Sam Hordern’s
daughters, Audrey, the younger, is Mrs.
Bill Winter-Irving, of Melbourne. Out-
door life makes a great appeal to Miss
Hordern. She is a member of the Orni-
thological Society and is very fond of
gardening—a taste she shares with her
mother.
The staff of the Conservatorium will
know Alfred Hill no more. He has been
on leave of absence from the Macquarie-
street sound factory, and has spent almost
his whole 12 months’ vacation in Mel-
bourne. Now he has come back to
Sydney, handed in his resignation and
is busy opening an academy of music.
Nicholson House, in George-street, is the
new address, and here in a concert hall
of good dimensions for chamber music
Alfred will give recitals for the real
music-lover. Maorilanders coming to
Sydney will, no doubt, politely rush these
recitals. They are very proud of Mr.
Hill, who lived so long among them and
found in their country inspiration for so
many of his compositions.
The lunch party of to-day is that ex-
tended (let’s hope it won’t be pulled
away) by the Royal Empirians to Com-
mander Reynolds. The Commander is
travelling commissioner of the society,
and his journey is mainly in quest of
more Fellows and to stir up a deeper
interest in the society. The Australia will
serve the fatted calf.
There’s nothing much wrong with the
youth of Sydney. This Letter was taking
an early-morning walk last Sunday when
she saw a tall, athletic young man, fresh
from his morning dip in the waters off
Cremorne, guarding a rocky ledge. The
object of his care was a wounded or
sick pigeon. He had found it quivering
along the ground in misery. Now he
was tending it with sippets of water and
such, and had placed it in the sun out
of reach of marauding cat or dog. Youth
guarding the dove! Philip Gibbs might
get a symbol of Peace from the picture.
Little Beryl Morrin, the victim of the
George’s River shark attack, is just
about ready to leave Canterbury District
Hospital for a convalescent home. The
plucky youngster, who will now have to
go through life without arms, had one
very interesting and helpful visitor. He
was Clyde Redshaw, who lost both his
arms through a railway accident when
he was a baby. He showed Beryl that it
was quite an easy matter to write with-
out hands ; and he told her how he served
his customers, even to handing out
change, at his little shop in Drummoyne.
He left the patient richer in hope and
courage. But that’s the sort of thing you
might expect from an old boy of Fort-
street High.


Melbourne
Chatter
After the heat and dust of their farms
Mallee mothers are spending a well-
earned holiday at Frankston. Some of
them have not known the tang of a sea-
breeze for 14 years, and many of the
youngsters had never seen a piece of
water larger than a dam. The Mallee
women are courageous souls and know
how to make the best of things. They
come up from the beach to see the city
after parking the smallest ones at the Rail-
way Creche and giving their other young-
sters into the care of camp officials who
take them on tours of inspection. The
Mallee folk gaze with incredulous eyes
at our shop windows, but they don’t
linger long in the vicinity of model
gowns, expensive materials, silver, china
and other extravagances—their steps auto-
matically take them to bargain base-
ments.
One day last week a holiday was given
to the regular kitchen staff engaged at
the camp for Mallee mothers and chil-
dren at Frankston, but the mothers didn’t
mind. The camp mother, Mrs. R. G.
Nichols, had so many volunteers ready
to roll up their sleeves that she is think-
ing of giving the staff another day off.
With Mrs. Marchant, of Manangatang,
as chief chef six mothers turned out a
first-class meal upon a foundation of
cabbage and that inevitable bush standby
corned beef. Archbishop Head and Arch-
deacon Lamble paid a surprise visit.
As a result of the Science Congress and
the Pharmaceutical Conference, there
has been an amount of talk about quacks
and quack remedies. But quacks have
flourished since the dawn of history, and
will continue to do so as long as there
are gullible people to line their pockets.
The witch-doctors of ancient Egypt found
the toad very useful (we don’t hear
nearly so much of the frog, which is
a much pleasanter animal to come in
contact with). The papyrus Ebers re-
cently discovered wrapped round a
mummy in a tomb at Thebes is a medi-
cal treatise which deals with eczema,
hookworm, catarrh and gangrene, among
other recognisable maladies. Most of its
prescriptions are so revolting that it’s a
wonder the Pharaohs and their subjects
ever survived, but there’s one compara-
tively palatable cure (?) for indigestion
—crush a hog’s tooth, mix with sugar,
make into pellets and eat one a day for
four days. This home remedy dates from
1500 B.c.
Of evil origin also were the ingredients
used in beauty lotions, but the Egyptian
ladies knew all about the value of line.
They plucked their eyebrows, painted
their lips, used eye-shadow and oiled
their lashes. And they varnished their
finger- and toenails as carefully as does
a 1935 flapper.
Women who purchased complete sum-
mer wardrobes are regretting their invest-
ments, for but for an odd day or two
we’ve had no summer. Shops are setting
out their woollen goods with enthusiasm,
for they know that we’ve a long winter
ahead. The new stuffs are soft and
supple, and often mingled with a cello-
phane thread. Many tweed suits are
made with wrap-over skirts, coats
are as long as the hem of the
skirts and Norfolk jackets have re-
turned to the sports departments. Many
suits are accompanied by scarves of
matching material. Buttons, which can
be made of anything—blocks of wood,
scraps of cork and even Brazil nuts —give
a dash of personality to a plain garment.
In a Collins-street shop a luscious silver-
fox cape made of heads and tails only
will make its wearer feel she’s taking
all her pets with her ; beady black eyes,
soft little ears and tickling whiskers
cuddle round her neck and beautiful tails
dangle upon her shoulders. Trains and
bustles are clinging hard to their glory,
and refuse to be pushed on to the shelf
altogether. Closed throats have had a
good innings, and necks are plunging
downwards.
All sorts of conveyances brought com-
petitors to the centenary dog show on
Saturday afternoon. For unless the body
in the suitcase stunt is used Melbourne
trams won’t carry four-footed pas-
sengers. To carry a wriggling bundle
swathed in a shawl (provided it doesn’t
bark) is the only other method of using
Governmental transport. Dogs of all
sizes and breeds were put through their
paces by owners who compete in the
sporting spirit, honor and glory as
their sole reward —trophies are seldom
more valuable than ribbons and butter-
dishes from chain stores. The dogs are
supposed to strike a happy medium be-
tween savagery and listlessness. Judges
are particular about temperament, and
tail-waggers who sit or lie down on
parade lose marks for laziness. The
largest dog in the show, even larger than
the Alsatians, was a six-months-old
Great Dane, who struck up a friend-
ship with a fleabite of a pug puppy.
There were two English sheep-dogs, one
with his hair clipped short upon head
and shoulders and the other with long
hair growing over his eyes in the ortho-
dox manner. His small boy-owner says
that his big woolly pet likes his eye-
covering as a protection against flies.
A Welsh congi caused something of a
stir, being the only representative of his
breed. He had a docked tail, but 50
per cent, of congis are born without
tails. This little fellow, with his Alsatian
face and long, low body, shows an un-
expected liking for warm sunshine.
Miss M. I. Izzard, in a white rain-
coat and brogues, had an entrant among
the borzois who also wore a raincoat,
grey with blue pipings. Mrs. Norman
Mitchell judged, among other classes,
the Samoyedes, in which Miss L. M.
Irving exhibited three snow-white im-
portations.
The lass who has not quite reached the
stage of deciding whether the long plaits
will go up or come off is Joan, younger
daughter of Dr. and Mrs. Maurice Mac-
Gillicuddy. Joan has just come home
from a holiday at Frankston with a coat
of suntan which suits her very well. She’s
always a busy little person. She plays
a lot of tennis, has been working hard
at school exams., and with her violin
has done extraordinary things, like get-
ting Grade II honors when she was 12,
scoring an A. Mus. A. when barely in
her teens and when she was 15 winning
first prize in the M.T.A. competitions, in
which she competed with students aged
up to 25. Joan’s teacher is Cathleen
Forbes. Broothorn made the portrait.
The Roy Grounds couple have built
themselves a new home at Ranelagh.
It’s a weird house, and there certainly
isn’t anything quite like it in Melbourne
It’s shaped like a ship, with portholes
instead of windows on the ground floor.
Near the fireplace in the lounge is
a brick seat (if it’s cold a cushion may be
collected from the many which are
strewn upon the floor). There’s a raised
platform for’ard of the lounge with door-
ways leading to the bedrooms, and the
kitchen (very modern and labor-saving)
is to be found aft. A spiral staircase—
really spiral; the people who get giddy
must stay below and look at the view
through the portholes—winds amidships
to another deck, which is glassed in like
a bridge. Here the nautical atmosphere
is enhanced by a telescope and an expan-
sive view over the bay. The architect-
owner possibly got his inspiration on a
recent trip to the U.S.A.
Compton Coutts, who died last week,
had no relatives in Australia, but he was
a man of many friends. His particular
pals were honored by invitations to his
digs in the Bohemian atmosphere of
George-parade, an alleyway of Old Mel-
bourne which runs down beside Jonas’s
fruit shop in the medical end of Collins-
street. The parade looks like the habitat
of “skunks and water-rats,” but “Bunny,”
as Compton was usually called, was very
proud of the locality. His home was a
cottage, its front door opening straight
off the footpath. He did his own house-
work and cooking, his kitchen was ar-
ranged in neat precision of blue enamel
saucepans, his meatsafe swung from a
fig-tree in the cobbled backyard.
Next door lives an old Swedish sailor-
man-cook who on special occasions
cooks in his own kitchen meals for the
Bohemians dwelling thereabouts. The
goods, piping hot, are delivered all to-
gether by the labor-saving method of a
billycan.
Radio listeners will miss Coutts, who
possessed one of the few pleasing speak-
ing voices sent over the air from Mel-
bourne broadcasting stations. He was
an Englishman, and knew how to pro-
nounce his vowels.
The Homecraft Hostel at Hawthorn,
a rambling old home situated behind a
generous expanse of lawn, beautiful tall
trees and a garden which is at present
a riot of petunias, has a new and im-
portant member upon its staff. She is
Edith Jackson, a dark-haired, dark-eyed
young woman wearing an attractive coat
of suntan acquired on the voyage from
Scotland to Australia, who has at her
fingertips all the wizardry of scientific
housekeeping. She took her diploma at
the Glasgow School of Domestic
Science, where the teaching staff numbers
45 and there are between 500 and 600
students on the roll. The equivalent of
the leaving certificate qualifies entrants
for the diploma course, which takes at
least two years and two terms, and in-
cludes chemistry and dietetics. The dip-
loma girls wear blue print uniforms,
white cuffs and collars and white nurses’
aprons, and students doing shorter
courses can be distinguished by overalls
of various colors. The college, which is
open to residential and day students, has
a sports ground, a swimming club and a
dramatic club. Staff and pupils are en-
couraged to eat their midday meal at
the college, for the students doing insti-
tutional cookery must have experience of
preparing meals for a multitude.
Miss Jackson, who is by birth a
Maorilander, has lived in England and
Scotland since she was 15. This is her
first trip to Australia. In her compre-
hensive cookery course she learnt to cook
haggis. She says it’s very troublesome to
prepare, but easy enough to cook. She
has never ventured to taste the finished
article.
At St. Colomb’s, Hawthorn, Bishop
Booth opened the gates of matrimony
for Marion, youngest daughter of Arch-
deacon and Mrs. Lamble, and Dr. Eric
Tymms, son of Dr. and Mrs. H. R.
Tymms, of Perth. The bride was attired
in pale corn-colored crepe fafonne, with
a wide circumference of matching straw
millinery, and she held cream gladioli
and gold roses. Marjorie Lamble
attended in moonstone-blue, her crepe
frock flecked with gold and creeping
downwards to touch the floor in a short
train.
A morning wedding followed by morn-
ing-tea with a handful of intimate friends
at Tudor Court was the choice of Bidda
Beveridge and A. Malcolm Mac Lean.
The bride wore shrimp-pink cellophane
tweed with a white hat and an arm
hidden in the vivid coloring of her sheaf
of gerberas. Her sister Betty and Mrs.
Henry Jowett attended in twig-green
woollen faille with white hats and posies
pinned to their white bags. The bride
is the elder daughter of Repat. medico
W. J. Beveridge and Mrs. Beveridge, of
Malvern, and the ’groom is the son of
Mrs. E. Mac Lean, of Kew. The newly-
wedded pair are furnishing a flat in
Kew. A Broothorn camera caught this
glimpse of the bride.
Dr. and Mrs. Adrian McKay came
over from Adelaide to see their only
daughter Austin take the matrimonial
stage opposite lan Henderson. Tiny
flowers from a lily-of-the-valley tree were
woven into a long trail which swung
from the bride’s wrist to the floor. Ah
upstanding halo of gardenias secured the
nebula of tulle which filmed over the
satin gown. Margaret Thompson and
Elizabeth Luxton attended in orchid-
tinted crepe suede cut with V necks
and swaying hip-length capes. The
colors in their posies were echoed by
their bandeaux of delphiniums and pink
and blue hydrangeas. The evening wed-
ding was followed by a reception at
No. 9.
Wilma Murphy, eldest daughter of
Mr. and Mrs. W. H. Murphy, of Haw-
thorn, has given an answer in the affir-
mative to Dr. J. H. Sinn, youngest son
of the late Mr. and Mrs. C. E. Sinn.
Peggy, only daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
Stanley Strutt, of Hunslet, Tongala, and
Rod, second son of Stephen Morel! and
his lady, have made a matrimonial pact.
News comes from Mrs. Duncan Brown
(Nina Murdoch) that she has written a
book on her wanderings in Spain which
has been accepted by an English pub-
lishing firm, and that she expects to
leave England for home soon after the
proofs are available. Mrs. Brown was
farewelled in Melbourne nearly a year
ago. She disembarked at Gibraltar, and
followed when possible the route taken
by the Moors on their invasion of Spain.
She also visited Portugal, and did a trip
to South America on a ship which went
1000 miles up the Amazon. In the book
being published she touches on neither
Portugal nor the Amazon, and as she
is such an industrious person it is more
than probable that other travel books
will follow her Spanish ramblings.
Dorothy Bauld wore pink-and-blue
plumage for her coming-out flight from
the parental nest. Her frock had syn-
thetic sleevelets achieved through shoul-
der embellishments, and a draped neck-
line which lapped the floor between twin
sashes of pansy-blue velvet. Begonias
flowered upon Mrs. W. D. Bauld’s black
satin shoulder. The young folks made
merry at the New Embassy.
Margaret Nicholson, who went abroad
as a dancer and returned a crooner,
was married last week to Hector Henry
McLennan, who also croons and can
produce rhythm out of weird and won-
derful brass instruments. The tall bride,
who wore deep-amber velvet with cream
lace collar and cuffs and a Fascist hat,
was given away by her father in Holy
Trinity Church, St. Kilda. She is the
only daughter of Mr. and Mrs. W.
Nicholson, of North-road, Brighton.
Guelda Pyke, whose inventive fingers
have created weird and wonderful masks,
string and boot-button jewellery and
decorative bandeaux, is at present seek-
ing inspiration in what is to everyone
else the most uninteresting corner of the
ironmongery department. Nails, screws
and bolts hold her entranced, and she has
been seen handling affectionately a large
iron meathook. One would never guess
that the ingredients of her barbaric belts
are ordinary chains woven together with
picture-wire. One brass girdle has a
fastener of little knobs and is worn with
matching wrist-fetters. Miss Pyke is also
making most becoming necklets by
stringing clusters of glass fruit and leaves.
Mary Bostock, who has been on a
jaunt through England, Germany, the
Tyrol and Spain, and Anna White, of
Farnham Common, England, who both
arrived in Melbourne by last week’s mail-
boat, were welcomed at Renny Hill,
Hopetoun-road, by Mrs. Herbert Thorn-
ton and Mrs. T. E. Bostock. Mrs.
Thornton poured tea in a gown of del-
phinium-blue, and Mrs. Bostock assisted
in black with ivory reliefs. Miss Bos-
tock’s color scheme was misty slate-blue,
and Miss White’s flowered chiffon with
black millinery.
Mrs. Douglas Cooke and her daugh-
ters Diana and Rosemary, who came to
Melbourne for the centenary, started on
the first lap of their journey back to
England last week. After a few days
spent in Adelaide they boarded the
Comorin.
Last week-end the Duke of Gloucester
experienced real tropical heat in Apia, in
British Samoa, where a cloud of steam
rises from the ground after each
shower of rain. Naval men from
H.M.A.S. Australia who made the
pilgrimage to Stevenson’s tomb were
glad of a breather at the top of
the climb, which must be done on foot.
Doubtless they rested on the stone-and-
concrete platform which covers the grave
of the Samoans’ beloved R.L.S. The
verses beginning “Under the wide and
starry sky” are carved upon the
tomb on this lonely jungle hilltop, which
commands a view of the harbor and the
wreck of a German steamer. Drinks,
showers and changes of clothes are im-
mediate necessities after the descent,
which is easier but dirtier than going up,
for one slides most of the way down the
steep and very slippery track winding
like a narrow tunnel through the dense
undergrowth. A favorite swimming-pool
a few miles out of Apia is in a clear
mountain stream adjacent to the water-
fall, which is great fun when used as a
chute. Government House, which used
to be Stevenson’s home, is still known as
Vailima.

THE LITTLE SISTERS.
SOUTH AUSTRALIA.
Keith, elder son of Mr. and Mrs.
Frank Forwood, Medindie, and Eliza-
beth, second daughter of Dr. and Mrs.
A. S. Randell, North Adelaide, Were mar-
ried at Christ Church, the bride wearing
magnolia satin with long pleated train;
the veil was parchment silk net, held
in place by a halo of orange-blossom
tads. Her sisters Mary and Barbara
and the bridegrooms sister Barbara
frocked in carnation-pink ninon and
large straw and ninon hats, attended her.
.., ’ _
In the evening of the same day Bruce,
the younger son of Chief Secretary
Ritchie was married at St. Peter s Col-
lege Church to Margaret Mary, eldest
daughter of Mr. and Mrs. A. H. Riggs,
of Gawler. The bridal gown was of
white lace, the train trimmed with a
pleated border of tulle ; and there were
two veils, the one long, extending over
the train, and the other reaching to the
shoulders and arranged in a full ruche
at the back of the head, held in place
by a narrow wreath of orange-blossom.
Bride’s sister Betty and Isabel Weaver,
in white blistered mousseline and small
white crepe georgette hats, were the
' t-v-i n iHn
. .
Mrs. 1. E. Barr-Smith entertained
about 30 friends at her home in the hills •
a farewell party for her daughter Ursula,
whose marriage to E. W. Hayward is
to take place shortly. Gladioli and mixed
flowers decorated the drawing-room and
the dining-room, where tea was served.
Though our weather this summer does
not lend itself to outdoor entertainment
Helen Bullock took a sporting chance
and gave a garden luncheon at her home
a t St. Helen’s, Prospect, as a farewell to
Christine Tipping, who will leave for
England with her parents by the Comorin

decked with gladioli and gerberas. Mrs.
Day continues her world tour in the
Orford.
WESTRALIA.
Molly and Rita McGibbon started the
entertainment of the international tennis-
pj a y ers with a morning-tea in honor of
tke champions’ womenfolk, and followed
it up with an informal party at their
home, where the visiting racquet-wielders
met a score or more of local enthusiasts,
The first day’s play had the added in-
terest of the opening of the new pavilion
at King’s Park, with a preliminary speech
by president McGibbon and the official
ceremony performed by Deputy-Gov-
ernor Mitchell. Mrs. Basil Bruce’s hori-
zontal cornflower-blue stripes and white
straw plateau beret were parked next the
Mitchell lady’s blue-and-rose florals
under the huge brolly at the corner of
the grandstand. Molly McGibbon’s
georgettes were in kingfisher blue and
white, and Rita’s white mohair cart-
wheel shaded grey and red silks.
King’s Park pavilion was filled to
capacity for the club’s tennis dance,
where president Basil Bruce acted as
host, with his better-half’s ice-blue flat
crepe and gold lame alongside, Madame
de Stefani scattered applique flowers
on her shaded satins ; Mrs. R. Menzel’s
brunette charms were enhanced by off-
white flat crepes ; gold lame glittered on
Mrs, Malcolm’s oatmeal marocain; Sig-
nora Constantino’s black satins were
yoked to mushroom-pink georgette, and
Mrs. Peacock, wife of the Consul for
Czecho-Slovakia in Victoria, chose flame-
and-white floral satin.
“Bubbles” Coleman and Deputy-Pre-
mier McCallum’s son Donald were mar-
ried at Wesley Church a few hours be-
fore they sailed in the Mongolia for a
six months’ visit to England. The bridal
white satins were slit up the centre of
the front and cut into a fish-tail train at
the back: above the cowl neck and dol-
man sleeves was a halter of stephanotis,
clouded by the mist of tulle which fell
from a swathe of silver lame. Matron
of honor Mrs. G. B. Johnson and brides-
maid Bessie Coleman sported frocks of
hydrangea-blue lined, folded and slashed
with deep delphinium-blue, with harmon-
ising sheaves of the two flowers. Their
wide tip-tilted dark-blue hats were tied
with lighter-toned cords. Toasts were
honored at the Palace^
For the Celtic Club’s at-home Mrs. E.
Needham’s crimson silks glittered with
diamente as she stood next her M.L.A.
husband to receive the guests and pilot
them to the easy-chairs arranged around
the tables on the' lawns. Eileen Hart,
Lorna Sydney-Smith, Roy Glenister and
Hugh Torrance provided music, and
after supper there was dancing in the
lounge.
The North-West cricket match was a
popular sporting and social event at the
W.A.C.A. grounds. After 150 men had
been entertained at lunch they were
joined by an equal number of the fair
sex, who were received by Alfred Sand-
over and Mrs. Roger Good, the lady
a summery vision in blue floral voiles
and a white sisal straw. The Vernon
Hammersleys were there, and the J. J.
Holmeses, with daughter Mavis and son
Bob ; the George Miles couple brought
along daughter Sylvia, and well to the
fore were the James Withnells, the Nor-
man D’Arcys, of Byro ; the Marmions,
of Kalgoorlie ; the Mervyn Forrests, of
Minderoo, and the George Burts, of Yin-
natharra.
Katherine Allnutt, youngest grand-
child of James Lee Steere and his lady,
celebrated her newly-acquired voting
status with a sherry party at the Esplan-
ade Hotel. Kilted frills of brown
organdie were blown on to her yellow-
and-brown-checked crush crepes, and a
wreaih of primroses garlanded her wide
brown ballibuntal. Aunts Misses Lee
Steere and Alice Lee Steere stood by, the
one in black marocain trimmed with
white, and the other in black-and-white-
figured ninon.
TASMANIA.
Full houses have enjoyed “Fresh
Fields” and “While Parents Sleep” at
Hobart Royal, and there has been no
adverse comment on the somewhat
strong meat provided. Our Repertorians
wouldn’t be allowed to get away with
anything half as highly spiced.
Before her wedding with George Dick
Zelda Bisdee was entertained morning,
noon and night by young friends, among
whom, as hostesses, were Cicely Davies
the two Watchorn girls (Jericho) and
Sybil Lyons.
Mrs. Frank Stops will be missed in
many circles in the south, but will no
doubt be just as active in the north,
where her husband’s change of job has
taken him. The Nat. Council of Women,
the Lyceum Club and many private!
friends farewelled her before leaving. .
Matron Hilda Smith has left St. John’s
Hospital and is to marry Dr. Inglis Clark.
Miss Kirkwood will reign in her stead.
The board of management of the hos-j
pital engineered a complimentary send-
off to the retiring matron and a welcome
to the incoming one.
Edgeworth David's widow, who has
put in some weeks with her
Mrs. W. K. Mclntyre, Launceston, has
gone back to Sydney.
Artist Lily Allport’s show of pictures
demonstrated that there were more arL
minded people in Hobart than one had
suspected. The studio was charmingly
arranged, and the painter’s versatility was
shown in landscape and portraiture, with
a scattering of color-prints and mono-
chrome woodcuts.

The po p u lar
conception of a
poster artist is
that he is a litho-
grapher’s laborer
—just one of the
hands. Very clever, no doubt, the way
he gives you in a flash the nostalgia of
a cigarette, the patine of a boot-polish,
the self-expressionism of a perfume. But
he got paid for it and did it on com-
mission ; how on earth could his arty
wings flap? Behind the veil of years
chuckles Michelangelo Buonarotti, who
started a ceiling on the Sistine chapel
under compulsion and with reluctance,
being ill-pleased to be drawn from sculp-
ture, and fell so in love with the job that
for 60 months he lay flat on his back
decorating panels.
At the Antarctic end of Sydney’s Pitt-
street there is a show of travel posters
accumulated by A. E. Martin, who used
to run the advertising end of the J. C.
Williamson business. It doesn’t sound
very inviting. This critic went in intend-
ing to spend a decorous ten minutes.
Eighty minutes elapsed before he re-
membered that such a thing as time
existed. Martin, who aims to make his
show a travel centre, has ransacked the
world for his material. He claims to
have a fair selection of the pictorial ad-
vertising issued by all countries on earth
with tourist-winning aspirations save
Turkey, and what he lacks on Turkey
posters he makes up on Turkey folders.
Every nation seems to approach travel-
poster-making from a different angle.
France and the rest of Middle Europe,
though they boost their beaches and
casinos and cathedrals for all they are
worth, like to hint at transient romance,
each in its own way. New Germany,
the Czecho-Slovaks and Soviet Russia de-
light in impressions of grandeur. Eng-
land gets naughtily Continental and even
trans-Atlantic in its seaside advertising
—the Brighton Girl says “Come down
and see me some time”—but the inland
towns and the lake districts produce
architectural and scenic poems to attract
the wanderer.
Some of the color effects are mag-
nificent—that’s the only word for them.
Coming out of the exhibition on a day
when a milky haze softened the distant
features of the Sydney cityscape this
critic wished that in a moment of aber-
ration the Government of New South
Wales would commandeer a dozen of the
town’s brightest young painters and com-
pel them to make Sydney pictorial in the
poster manner. It ought to be the most
congenial job they ever had.

Art Going
to Waste
Dr. Booth,
Melbourne cul-
tural enthusiast,
advised the Old
Players and Play-
goers’ Club to
agitate for the establishment of a civic
theatre, as there was no chance of a suc-
cessful appeal to the Government.
But the suitability of a hall is a minor
consideration. The artistic drama stands
or falls by its own merits or demerits.
“Two actors, a plank and a passion”
have been prescribed by a famous
authority as the only essentials for a
drama, and these are obtainable for next
to nothing.
A trouble is that the endless drama-
tic organisations which rise and fall.
This Matisse is one of the great classics of impressionism. It expresses
not only the unutterableness of goldfish but a number of new facts about
anatomy. It is a rich mine of inner truths, one of them being that a
Frenchman can never be too audacious. From Anthony Horderns'
exhibition of modernist prints.
almost weekly in Melbourne and Sydney
don’t possess more than two actors in the
casts they place before their publics.
They have tails like kangaroos. Yet
nearly every one of them can boast
one man or one woman who can
act —some of them well up to profes-
sional form, and without the faults which
disfigure much professional acting.
The multitude of amateur societies
around the capitals perform an excellent
service to the playlover by giving him a
chance to see plays which can never by
any possibility reach the commercial
stage ; further, which is more important,
they give the Australian dramatist an
opportunity of revealing what talent is
possessed by Australia in this branch
of art.
What militates against the even pro-
duction of a play is that the companies
are subjected to what is known in eco-
nomic circles as the “labor turnover.”
The actors drift from one body to an-
other almost with every production.
When Maisie Smith, of the Diminutive
Players, plays a chambermaid part with
success, she becomes annoyed because
she has no hope of ousting Jenny Jones
from the star part of the next production.
So she promptly gets together half a
dozen other disgruntled ones, and there
arises another body called the Tiny
Players. Maisie does well or ill in the
first show, but Molly Brown is highly
praised for her charwoman, and she in
turn wants a star part. So she and some
malcontents form the Infinitesimal
Players, and so on to infinity. It is the
dilution of ability which checks the suc-
cess of the non-commercial drama. If
it were possible to get together a com-
bination of the most capable amateurs,
cast them without prejudice and make
them sufficiently far-seeing to do their
work however insignificant the part, the
artistic drama would be a power and a
reality fit to demand a Government or
civic playhouse. In the meantime, it is
possible to prove its ability in one of the
score of halls available for a few shillings
a night. If the people who can act are
sufficiently determined and self-sacrificing
to do that, they will be able to go to the
authorities with a good case. At present,
the first question Dr. Booth and his sup-
porters will be asked is “Can you deliver
the goods?” I fancy they can, but the
goods have never yet been displayed
properly, and it is not to be expected that
Governments and municipalities are
going to buy a pig in a poke. The first
necessity of a strong artistic drama is the
sterilisation of the unfit—the unfit drama-
tic societies which exist only for the
aggrandisement of a handful of indi-
viduals.

The Tradition
of the Ballet
Recent Sundry
Shows attacks on
the Russian Ballet
do not go half
far enough. De-
bunkation of the
ballet as an institution is overdue.
I have sat through ballets in Australia,
London, Paris. I have seen Great Balle-
rinas of modern times before they came
to Australia; even before their arteries
had begun to harden. I saw them sup-
ported by other famous principals and
a host of coryphees whom critics who
knew more than I recognised as the
world’s best. On every occasion I can
honestly aver I was bored stiff.
On the opening night of the Russian
Ballet in Melbourne I discussed the first
half of the show with one man and
several women. The man was older than
I am, and had seen twice as many
ballets in twice as many places. The
women were all younger than I, and their
ballet experience had been limited. I told
them all I was frankly disappointed, not
at the show itself, but at the ballet gener-
ally as an entertainment, a force, a sym-
bol, an education, a work of art or what-
ever else they cared to term it.
They spoke of beauty of form, grace
of movement. I horrified all the women
by countering that there is more beauty
of form and grace of movement in 10
rounds of two willing, well-trained pugil-
ists than in all the ballets ever staged.
The man, who knew his ring as well as
he knew his stage, agreed. The women
registered further horror and demanded
the feminine element in beauty. I was
regarded as a brute when I told them
that the male form was infinitely more
beautiful than the female—perfection
against perfection—and that it was only
sex appeal which led to man preferring
the spectacle of shapely girls in ballets,
circuses, pictures. If beauty of female
form was sought, combined with grace of
movement, I offered to take them to any
beach around Port Phillip or Sydney’s
ocean front and show them more of it
than they could muster in all the ballets
of the world.
“But the dancing!” Where was
there dancing such as the full-length
ballet proffered to those capable of
appreciating beauty of form and grace
of movement? I replied that more
beauty of form and grace of move-
ment was to be found in the ballets of
musical comedies and pantomimes and
vaudeville shows than in any full-length
ballet yet presented. They laughed me to
scorn ; they referred to the exploits of
world-famous dancers, and demanded
that I should produce any mere stage
dancer to compare with these. I admitted
that probably no stage dancers could
perform the same evolutions; but I
maintained, and still maintain, that such
evolutions are generally neither graceful
nor beautiful.
It is very wonderful to see a woman
going through a long dance on the tip
of her big toe—but it is not graceful and
it is not beautiful. Standing on one toe
and slowly raising the other to five
minutes to twelve is not beautiful either.
The whole belief that ballet dancing is
graceful and beautiful arises from the
confusion of art and virtuosity.
The ballet has the same appeal—the
appeal of the other acrobat who can tie
himself into knots never previously wit-
nessed by any audience. Many of these
wonderful feats of distortion could be far
more capably performed by a robotte
evolved from ball-sockets and connecting-
rods and universal joints by some capable
engineer. That robotte would be un-
likely to be as beautiful as most of the
ballet dancers we have seen, but it would
be infinitely more astounding in its move-
ments—there is no limit on the fantastic
evolutions it could be made to perform.
And if it were not so beautiful, it would
be just as graceful.

Humor Story Entry:-
NOBODY'S
GOAT
BY GAVIN S. CASEY
GOATS, said old Dick, are funny
anymiles. They gits no encourage-
ment in parts where the grass is
green, so they lives in other places where
there ain’t no grass, an’ still they thrives,
an’ manages to produce richer milk than
a cow does —all on a diet of out-o’-date
newspapers.
I knoo a flock what lived fer six
months on abandoned minin’ machinery,
and after a few weeks of it they wasn’t
givin’ milk at all —they was givin’ thick
cream. Tord the end o’ the time they
wasn’t givin’ cream even. The strength-
enin’ tucker had brought ’em to the stage
where they give out pure butter, an’ a’
awful job it was to git it from ’em.
A bloke 1 knoo had a scheme to make
a fortune out of
’em, but jist then
the price o’ gold
rose, an’ he
couldn’t git no
ball mills an’
things to feed
’em on.
Anyway, that’ll
show yer what
goats is like, an’
help yer to appre-
ciate the awful
time we had with
the goat menace
in Walkabit.
“I got a idea.”
Walkabit’s about a hundred an’ fifty
miles from Kalgoorlie, an’ the on’y
reason I could ever think of fer the
name was that if yer walked a bit further
you didn’t have to walk no more.
Except, o’ course, if yer took a fancy
to bein’ a ghost an’ hauntin’ someone.
The on’y anymiles what could have lived
on the country round Walkabit without
artyficial assistance, an’ plenty of it, is
goats, an’ when I went there there
weren’t no goats—if you barred a few o’
the blokes what had went there to make
their fortunes.
IT wuz a hell of
* a place, with
no ground you
could git more than
tucker out of, ex-
cept a strip what a
lot o’ Dagoes had.
But things was bad
everywhere but on
the goldfields, an’
there was plenty o’
young fellers scrap-
in’ along on little
shows about the
place, an’ hopin’
they’d strike a
Golden Eagle
every time they
Bill Molloy.
turned over a bit o’ dirt.
There was nothin’ to do after dark
but go visitin’ each other, an’ nothin’ to
do when yer got together but talk about
beer. Beer ain’t brewed to be talked
about, an’ it was all very unsatisfyin’.
Tinned dog is thirsty sort o’ tucker, an’
since the mail truck with a bit o’ fresh
meat on’y come out once a week, if the
roads was good enough, that was the
general fare. It didn’t matter
much to the old blokes like
me, what was used to it, but it
was hard on the young fellers.
'THERE was a young chap called Bill
* Molloy, what had a shanty jist near
mine, who particularly missed them little
comforts what you don’t git when yer
bed’s on’y a few inches above a dirt
floor, an’ who partic’larly objected to
the little anymiles you do git.
He was from the cocky districks —one
o’ them blokes what’d rather miss a
couple o’ meals than the “Sunday Times”
—an’ though he didn’t grizzle much he
wasn’t too happy, an’ the on’y thing what
kep’ him there was that he didn’t know
no other place to go. He was alius get-
tin’ bright ideas, an’ it was him what
really started the goat menace, though
unintentional, o’ course.
One night him an’ a few other fellers
was over at my camp, an’ we was all
talkin’ about what we’d do if we won
Tatt.’s, when he had one of his brain-
waves. He’d been quiet while we was
debatin’ whether it’d be best to buy a
pub, or whether that’d be too much
trouble an’ it’d be best to jist buy th’
stock, when all of a sudden he lets out
a yell.
“By cripes,” he says, “I got a idea.”
“Well,” says one o’ the fellers, “what’d
you do? Go right to the beginnin’ o’
things an’ buy a brewery?”
“What?” says Bill, perplexed. “Oh,
I ain’t talkin’ about that. I got a real
idea we can put into action straight away.
None o’ you blokes thinks much o’ this
here water we all got to drink, do you?”
“By gosh, no!” says everyone, simul-
taneous-like.
“Well,” says Bill, “how’d yer like to
alius have a permanent supply o’ some-
thin’ better?”
A couple o’ the blokes looks hopeful
an’ interested, but most of ’em thinks
it can’t be done.
“It ain’t possible,” says one of ’em.
“By the time that cow with the truck
gits it here it ain’t fit to drink. Anyway,
it’s too dear, an’ he breaks half the
bottles.”
“Who’s talkin’ about bottles?” asks
Bill. “An’ it ain’t too dear if you’ve got
the source of supply on the spot.”
“Golly,” says someone, “y’ don’t
mean to say you can brew it yerself?”
“Brew it?” says Bill. “You don’t
brew it. It comes of a process o’ nature.
If four of us gits a goat, all we got to
do is milk it every day.”
“Aw!” says the mob, with a sigh o’
disappointment. “Milk !”
“I thought you said better than
water?” says one bloke.
After that nobody’ll listen to Bill, but
he gits more determined than ever to go
on with his plan, an’ he confides in me,
“There’s thousan’s o’ goats in Kal-
goorlie an’ Boulder, Dick,” he says.
“Why, they used to have goat races at
all the big sports carnivals there one
time, they tell me. A man’ll git one fer
a song, an’ I’m goin’ to, an’ all you
blokes’ll want some o’ the milk when I
do. A goat’ll live on nex’ to nothin’, an’,
y’ can say what y’ like, milk’s better than
water —even if it ain’t as good as beer,”
HE sticks to th’ resolution, an’ nex’
time the truck goes through, an’ he
sends a order to his grocer, he scribbles
a message acrost the bottom of it.
Kicks the goat in th' midriff.
“Please send one goat,” he writes;
“young, healthy an’ in good condition.”
Then he spends a week goin’ about the
place with a expression on his face like
a chess champeen what’s shoved a sly
move over the other bloke, after not
more’n a couple o’ hours’ thought.
By the nex’ time the truck is due Bill’s
goat has raised a bit of interest, an’ the
mob, who is all waitin’ fer their tucker
an’ newspapers, are chyackin’ him
about it,
“list you wait an’ see, you silly cows,”
he says, lofty-like.
In due course we sees what must be
the mail truck cornin’. On’y it seems
that the young feller what has the con-'
tract must’ve got another motor, ’cause
the old one had a canopy, but this one
ain’t. When it pulls up, though, it looks to
be the same one. The driver, with all the
skin burnt orf his nose an’ a nasty look
in his eye, jist sits there, glarin’ at us
unpleasant-like.
“Where’s the top o’ yer truck, Fred?”
yells out one o’ the boys.
The driver splutters a bit, like as if it
was stuck in his throat, but it turns out
it ain’t him that’s got it.
“What about my hood?”
“It’s where that blasted Molloy’ll have
to pay fer it,” he shouts. “That there
-t —• anymile flamin’ well et
it”
He points behind, an’, reclinin’ at ease
in lofty scorn o’ all the fuss an’ bother,
is Bill Molloy’s goat.
“By cripes! ” says Bill, alarmed. “O’ y’
mean ter say my goat’s et all that stinkin’
old canvas orf your hood? Well, that
there goat’s costin’ me money, an’ you
look out if there’s any stummick
trouble.”
“What about my hood?” yells Fred.
“An’ what about Tom Miller’s meat?
It et all Tom Miller’s meat, too, before
I found out what sort of a flamin’ appe-
tite it had!”
“Oh, did it?” says Tom Miller, sud-
denly gettin’ interested. “Well, what
are you goin’ to do about that, young
feller?”
“Never mind, Tom,” says Bill; “I’ll let
you have a bit o’ mine, an’ make it up
to yer in milk. A bit o’ nice fresh milk’ll
go well, won’t it, Tom?”
When they’re unloadin’ the truck they
finds that a pair o’ workin’ boots an’
two pick-handles fer different blokes is

No matter whether you suffer the
“slight” inconvenience of the first
symptoms of Indigestion (Heartburn,
Wind, Palpitation), or the more painful
and dangerous Gastritis, Dyspepsia,
Colitis, Ulcerated Stomach or Bowels
—you can get relief. Relief immediate
and progressive. Not through harmful
and deadening drugs, but by common-
sense and modern principles. DeWitt’s
Antacid Powder acts in a three-fold way.
Firstly, it neutralises the excess acid
which the stomach continually produces,
and allays the irritation.
Secondly, the ulcers are coated with
a film of colloidal-kaolin. So finely
powdered is this kaolin, that it is easily
spread over the entire surface of the
stomach. This protects the inflamed
tissues from the hot, burning acids.
Thirdly, it actually digests portions
of your food, thereby still further taking
the load off the weakened stomach, and
finally, the ingredients in De Witt’s
Antacid Powder so assist Nature to
build up an alkaline reserve in the body,
that, with ordinary care, there will be
no recurrence of your trouble
Take De Witt’s Antacid Powder

missin’, too ; an’ eventually Bill on’y gits
his goat after payin’ out heavy compen-
sation. .
“Blast the unreasonable swine! he
says to Miller as they lead the anymile
away. “Anyway, it’ll be worth it fer
the milk.”
Jist then one o’ the fellers what ain’t
got inter th’ argyment doubles up,
laughin’ like a jackass.
“What’s wrong with you?” snaps Bill,
real savage.
“Ho, ho, ho! ” yells the bloke. “Worth
it fer the milk! By cripes, that’s funny.
Ho, ho, ho! Can’t yer see? Worth it
fer the milk —an’ it’s a flamin’ billygoat!”
WELL, that’s the end o’ the goat bein’
Bill’s goat. After that it’s nobody’s
goat.
Bill curses the storekeeper fer thinkin’
we want a pet or a racin’ anymile in
Walkabit, an’ kicks the goat in the mid-
riff somethin’ savage. The goat, not
bein’ of a forgivin’ nature, retaliates by
boltin’ into Bill’s hut an’ buntin’ down
two walls to git out agin. After that it
embarks on a life of idleness an’ crime
in the districk, living orf the enemy’s ter-
ritory, as it were, an’ the goat menace is
started.
Our goat menace on’y has one goat
at the back of it, but all the same it’s
as good a goat menace as any o’ them
the councils in Kalgoorlie an’ Boulder
is always talkin’ about. We’re a peaceful,
law-abidin’ settlement, an’ we ain’t got
no poundkeepers, an’ not even fences,
though I dunno as it would’ve made
much difference if we had.
Ordinary goats is pretty good at git-
tin’ in an’ out o’ trouble, but this par-
tic’lar one is what they calls a genius
at it. After he’d snuck into my camp an’
et me fav’rite pipe—a strong ’un it was,
too —an’ had chawed up a few bag beds
an’ had a hearty meal off a packet o’
detonators, we took to leavin’ lit pipes
Jist pecked about at jam-tins.
an’ boxes o’ matches about, in the hope
he’d have a go at them an’ blow hisself
up with the detonators. But he’s too
shrewd fer that.
He’d bin shot fer sure, on’y nobody
had anythin’ bigger’n a twenty-two. One
day a feller whose name I fergit gave
him a charge o’ pellets out of a gun, but
the goat on’y shook his head an’ bunted
the bloke down his own shaft.
We on’y had a couple o’ days’ peace
in a fortnight, an’ that was when he
pinched some Italian sausage from th’
furriners’ camp. After that he seemed
a bit low-sperited fer a while, an’ jist
pecked about at jam-tins an’ so forth
till he got well agin.
How he gits to be officially known
as the goat menace is
through Gussy Keeler
havin’ to go into Kal-
goorlie with about half
a suit o’ clothes on, the
goat havin’ et the other
half. Gussie is in a
draper’s shop, replacin’
the damaged duds, when
a visitin’ noospaper bloke from Perth
walks in.
“Good Gawd, friend,” says the noos-
paper bloke, “what happened to yer*
clothes?”
“A goat et ’em,” says Gussy, bitter-
like. “An’ I’m buyin’ a forty-four an’
a packet o’ bullets before I go back to
Walkabit.”
“Ha, ha!” says the other feller. “You
left ’em out, did yer?”
“Left ’em out be darned!” says Gus.
“The anymile et me tin trunk to git at
’em.”
“My word,” remarks the writer cove,
“that’s interestin’! Th’ goats must be
terrible bad at this Walkabit.”
“My oath they are,” says Keeler, who
has jist found a quiet checked suit he
likes the look of, an’ is cheerin’ up a
bit. “Ask anybody from Walkabit an’
they’ll tell you we’d rather have a plague
of alligators.”
WELL, lookin’ at hisself in mirrors
” alius puts Gussy in a cheerful, leg-
pullin’ frame o’ mind, an’ soon he’s
stringin’ that bloke on a treat; an’ the
result is that one day, not long after the
mail bloke has been through, a feller
comes rushin’ inter my camp.
“Gorblimey,” he yells, wavin’ a paper,
“look at this! Our town is on the map.”
I takes the paper, an’ sure enough
Walkabit has got a mention. “Goat
Menace on the Goldfields,” says a head-
line, an’ underneath it a smaller head-
line says “Nomad Goats Harass Miners
at Walkabit.” The article goes on to
explain how the wild camels o’ the Nul- 1
larbor Plains has a parallel, whatever
Et three tyres.
that is, in the wild goats what has drifted
from Kalgoorlie and menaced the com-
fort an’ even the safety o’ the gallant
prospectors in Walkabit.
“A miner from the district, interviewed
in Kalgoorlie, where he was replenishin’
a wardrobe almost totally depleted by the
ravages o’ the anymiles,” it says, “was
also seizin’ the opportunity to buy arms
an’ ammunition so that he an’ his com-
rades might defend themselves agin the
wild goats.”
“Well,” says the bloke what brought
the paper, “fancy Bill’s goat doin’ all that!
I never knoo he was a nomad, though.
What is a nomad, anyway, Dick?”
I explains to him that a nomad is a
partic’lar kind o’ goat, like a Angora
rabbit is a partic’lar kind o’ rabbit,
on’y different to ord’nary goats in
bein’ fiercer, an’ not in havin’ softer
hair, an’ then we shows the article to
all the boys. It caused a lot of interest,
believe me.
We begins to take quite a pride in the
goat, an’ partic’larly so when a later
copy o’ the same paper has a letter to
the editor suggestin’ that the goat men-
ace at Walkabit might be overcome the
same way as they overcome the emu
menace in the wheat belt—by sendin’
some soldiers along with machine-guns to
shoot em down. That makes us quite
proud o’ the goat, though we decides
that if the Guv’ment offers to send any
soldiers we’ll turn ’em down. We sup-
poses them blokes what are paid fer it
has to risk life an’ limb now an’ agin,
but there ain’t a very big army in Aus-
tralia, an’ we reckons the odds would
be too great. We doesn’t want a lot o’
dead soldiers on our minds.
GUSSY KEELER come back from Kal-
goorlie without a rifle, havin’ spent
all his money on beer, so the goat wasn’t
even worried by him. It certainly wor-
ried all of us, though, an’ when Curley
Lewis, who had a good claim near the
furriners, had a chance of havin’ a
option took over it be a comp’ny, an’
the goat spoiled his chance, we thought
somethin’ ought to be done.
Y’ see, a big minin’ bloke come out
from town to have a look at Curley’s
show, an’ while he was lookin’ the goat
et three tyres off his car, an’ the bloke
made up his mind that Curley must own
the anymile, an’ was so peeved he
wouldn’t have anythin’ more to do with
him.
We had a meetin’ to see what’d better
be done, an’ Bill Molloy had another
brainwave.
“They have a lot o’ trouble with
prickly-pear in Queensland, don’t they?”
“Our town is on
the map.”
he asks.
“Yes,” says some-
one. “We’re lucky
we ain’t got it to in-
terfere with minin’
over here.”
“Well,” says Bill,
“what they need is
our goat. They can
breed from him an’
train the kids to eat
it.”
No one was keen
on the idea. Queens-
land was far enough
away, all right, but
it would’ve taken a long while to get
someone to handle that end of the
scheme.
“I know,” says Tom ; “y’ got him to
get somethin’ to drink from, didn’t yer?
Well, y’ can’t do that, but y’ can eat the
cow.”
“Crikey,” says Bill. “Not while
there’re old boots about!”
It took us a long while to think out
what to do with that goat, said old Dick,
but we thought of a way eventually. We
put up with him till Walkabit was “cut
out” altogether, an’ then we all left, an’
let him have the joint to hisself. That’s
about all it was good for, anyway.

Dr. D. Jacobsen
- noted med
ical authority
It is definitely established that
modern foods do not stimulate the
bowel muscles to sufficient action.
Consequently, though your habits
be regular, particles of food-waste
are left in the folds and crevices of
the intestine. These fragments of
food-waste remain in the colon
day after day sometimes for
weeks or months—decaying and
breeding germs and poisons which
enter the blood-stream and pro-
duce the condition known as Self-
poisoning or “ Autoxima,” from
which nine out of ten suffer.
WHAT DOCTORS SAY
Medical opinion now regards Self-
poisoning as one of the principal
causes of ill-health. Rheumatism,
Sciatica, Neuritis, Headaches, In-
digestion, Constipation, Bladder
Ailments, Depression, Weakness,
Catarrh, Eczema, Skin Troubles

My Political
Life
By W.A. HOLMAN
WILLIS
AGAIN
A final and
most furi o u -
attempt to oust
Willis from his
chair came within an ace of succeeding.
Though McGowen was whole-hearted
enough in his support of the new
Speaker’s authority, the Opposition felt
that he would be glad to see it come to
an end. Its plan was based on this.
Willis had been made the subject of re-
markably strong expressions in a bitter
attack by the “Daily Telegraph,” and
had retaliated by excluding its represen-
tatives from the use of the Reporters’
Gallery.
This was a mistake. The Speaker, who
had up to this carried through a difficult
position with great tact, was here be-
trayed into his one important error of
judgment. McGowen’s Parliamentary in-
stincts were specially outraged. We had
a long discussion with the Speaker, and,
as a result, drew up two resolutions for
submission of the House - which refor-
mulated the whole situation in accord-
ance with McGowen’s views of Consti-
tutional propriety.
One was a merely declaratory state-
ment, intended to fill a gap in the existing
Standing Orders. It provided that the
Speaker should have control of the press
galleries, and provide therein for the
accommodation of the representatives of
such newspapers as he thought fit, but
that the House might from time to time
direct by resolution that the representa-
tives of any special paper should be
admitted. The second resolution was a
specific direction in favor of the repre-
sentatives of the “Daily Telegraph.” I
gave the necessary notices of motion, and
the two resolutions appeared upon the
business paper.
The members of the Opposition saw
here their opportunity. They knew that
we would support our resolutions, and
that if they did so, too, the resolutions
would be carried. They proposed to de-
bate them in terms so offensive to the
dignity of the Speaker as to make it im-
possible for him to continue in the chair
unless the resolutions were defeated,
which was practically impossible. After
they had been discussed for some hours
with sufficient vigor of language and car-
ried —as they would be —Willis would
have no course but to resign. This would
not now have had the destructive effect
of three months earlier upon us, because
by this time our majority had been re-
stored. But in politics virtue is always
its own reward, and the prospect of a
personal victory over the Speaker was a
sufficient attraction without the thought
of material gain.
Loud Opposition cheers had greeted
my reading of these notices, and honor-
able members whetted their daggers in
anticipation of the slaughter. For the
first time since Willis ascended the throne
it appeared as if his domination was in
jeopardy.
VOTE OF
CENSURE
At this stage,
for some occult
reason which has
never been ex-
plained, the leaders of the Opposition
decided to move a vote of censure on the
Government, connected with the absence
of Nielsen. Wade, who moved it, on the
whole in gentle terms, disclaimed any
intention of personal attack upon Nielsen
or any suggestion of his unfitness for the
post, but he asserted that our object had
been to get Nielsen out of the way, for
fear that he should attack us at the
Labor Conference over the Conversion
Bill. Further, that the appointment,
accompanied as it was by the payment
of a daily allowance for expenses, was
a breach of the Constitution Act. Niel-
sen had accepted an office of profit under
the Crown, and his seat must therefore
be declared vacant.
This contention had more than an
academic interest for us. If the seat was
really vacant our always precarious
majority was once more dependent on
the issue of a by-election in a seat where
our majority was small. Naturally
enough, debate raged to some extent
around this lesser but more vital ques-
tion, the larger issue as to whether the
Government deserved censure being a
little eclipsed. On this point I had an
acceptable, if not altogether convincing,
case to present. It was, at all events,
quite good enough for members of our
own party, who saw in this outburst
from the Opposition benches merely one
more effort to overthrow the Govern-
ment I was also able to point out that
Nielsen’s departure had occurred ten and
a half months before, when its conditions
were made widely known.
The censure motion, was defeated, and
it is difficult to see what purpose the
Oppositionists were serving by bringing
it on.
The following night had been set aside
by general arrangement for the hearing
of the addresses of counsel represent-
ing the gas companies affected by Car-
michael’s bill, a night memorable for a
most brilliant address by B. R. Wise,
who revisited the scene of his many Par-
liamentary triumphs and addressed us
from the bar as counsel.
The situation which had developed by
the Thursday, when my resolutions were
at last reached, was electrical. McGowen
had spoken on the Parliamentary issue
involved. He was fully supported
within the Caucus and on the floor of
the House, Any change of attitude was
out of the question. It was impossible
that the resolutions should miscarry or
that the voice of the Opposition should
be unheard during the process.
On the other hand, the resolution about
the “Telegraph” was a clear note of cen-
sure, and its carriage would make it im-
possible for Willis to remain in the chair.
WILLIS AND THE
NEWSPAPERS
In the mean-
time Willis had
sent for me pri-
vately, and we
had had a long, guarded and highly dip-
lomatic conversation. I left him with
the impression that a declaratory resolu-
tion that all the newspapers were entitled
to gallery seats would be accepted by
him as conveying the considered decision
of the House, without any special direc-
tion concerning the “Daily Telegraph.”
A tremendous concession, but it left
untouched the main problem, which still
was how to get any resolution carried,
in any terms, without such an outburst
of well-chosen vituperation from the
Opposition as would make it quite im-
possible for the Speaker to remain
Speaker thereafter.
Properly handled, a way out from the
clash of opposing forces might yet be
found. I accordingly arranged with the
leader to leave the whole conduct of the
debate on the new Standing Orders en-
tirely in my hands.
I arranged with Griffith to come in
at a psychological moment, to be decided
later, and move a general declaration of
rights, conferring upon all registered
newspapers freedom of entry to the press
gallery during the sittings of the House,
as an amendment to be added as an
opening sentence to my resolution.
Griffith did this in a style that con-
cealed from everybody the fact that a
vital change was being made in the
scheme of the resolutions.
Thrower came forward with another
amendment, the child of his own fancy.
It fitted in quite well, and I got up and

in my mildest tones agreed to accept
bpth and incorporate them in my original
resolution.
PARLIAMENTARY
TACTICS
At a later stage
Kelly (another
member of our
party) suggested
yet another amendment, and I agreed to
accept that also. “Does the Attorney-
General know what he is doing?” asked
Wood, deputy-leader of the Opposition.
“Suppose I were to move an amendment
in the same spirit, would he receive it
with the same amiability?” I replied that
if it were a good amendment I certainly
would accept it. Wood was too disgusted
to reply to this with anything but a con-
temptuous “Pshaw! ”
All these amendments were incorpo-
rated, and I wound up the debate by a
short reply. The resolution having been
put from the chair, members of the
Opposition, gnashing their teeth in an-
ticipation of the night out they intended
having when the second resolution came
up, permitted it to pass quite easily.
Almost the whole of the members re-
mained in the House after the division,
which was a most unusual happening,
and in itself the clearest portent of
the impending storm. An agitated
hum commenced on the Opposition
benches, and everybody got ready to let
go. It then fell to me to rise and say
in the most amiable tones: “Order of the
day No. 34, Mr. Speaker; resumption of
debate on the Gas Bill.”
TRIUMPH!
This was a
moment of real
achievement —one
of the moments of my life. For an in-
stant a stupefied silence descended upon
the whole House. Members could not
believe that they had heard aright. The
Gas Bill? Who in the world wanted to
discuss the Gas Bill? Our own men,
who, with the exception of Griffith, were
as much in the dark as the Opposition,
were as much staggered. J. C. L. Fitzpat-
rick—always the quickest in the uptake
of the whole House—was the first to see
what the announcement meant. He pro-
claimed in a voice of thunder from a
back bench: “The cows aren’t going on
with the second resolution at all!”
And this was so. Having got my first
resolution peacefully through in the form
I wanted, and having had the Speaker’s
assurance that in that form he would act
upon it, I had no idea whatever of going
on with the second,, which from that
moment passed tranquilly over into
Hmbo. There were wild cries and much
excitement upon the Opposition benches
for a while, but these died down, and
the House turned, dully enough, to its
duties on the subject of illumination, on
which, under the guidance of the inde-
fatigable Carmichael, it made substantial
progress.
. The Speaker declared the resolution
a perfectly proper one, indicating in plain
terms the views of the House upon a
doubtful but important point. The reso-
lution contained absolutely no phrase
which the most sensitive temperament
could construe into offensiveness, and the
debate had been carried on throughout
on a plane of the highest decorum, with
every regard to the dignity of Parliament
and of the Speaker’s chair. As Parlia-
ment’s chief officer he was bound to give
effect to its resolutions, and he had
already done so. On the Tuesday follow-
ing the “Daily Telegraph” would be
found in the gallery reporting the doings
of the House, and he, the Speaker, would
be found on the floor conducting them.
All the matters that had happened had
happened for the best. He was right, and
they were right, and everything was
quite correct.
HOLMAN AS
MINISTER FOR
JUSTICE
In attempting
to give some idea
of my experiences
as Minister for
Justice, I must
point out that the
\jnusual conditions affected me very
much. I not only held the portfolio of
Attorney-General as well (an arrange-
ment which I am satisfied should never
be made) but during a considerable por-
tion of my incumbency of the office I
Acting-Premier, and for the whole
of the time deputy-leader of the party,
a post the duties of which were steadily
increasing.
There was then no Court of Criminal
Appeal. The only possible correction for
a miscarriage of justice was a procedure
under the Crimes Act, which the Gover-
nor might direct, upon the Minister’s
advice, and which thus involved pre-
liminary inquiry and decision by the
Minister himself.
A “PRESS-
MANUFACTURED
REPUTATION”
Now, the cam-
paign in the press
against myself
had led, in addi-
tion to the diffi-
culties mentioned.
to an unexpected further embarrassment.
My press-manufactured reputation for
soft-heartedness spread rapidly among
the criminal classes, and all the old hands
thought it worth while to make some
effort at swinging the lead with the new
Minister. They had every right to sup-
pose that the new Minister existed pri-
marily for the purpose of letting guilty
persons out of gaol. The “Daily Tele-
graph” told them so almost every day.
THIS led to an enormous multiplication
* of the distressing stories which
awaited me whenever I made a visit to a
gaol. At Parramatta, devoted to the ac-
commodation of habitual criminals —con-
victed three times or upwards—l found
no fewer than 22 inmates who had been
convicted wrongfully. When I say that
I saw every one of those men separately
and had notes taken of their statements,
and that I personally investigated every
case and satisfied myself that the guilt
charged had been proved beyond all
reasonable doubt, it will be seen that the
task I had let myself in for, or rather
which my friends of the press had given
me, was a tremendous one. Similar
applications came from all the gaols in
the State, though from none in quite the
same numbers as from that home of mis-
understood inhocence Parramatta.
ATTITUDE
TOWARDS
APPEALS
I made it a
rule never to dis-
miss one of these
appeals without
the fullest com-
prehension of the
nature and quality of the evidence upon
which the conviction was based, or with-
out satisfying myself that it was enough to
remove all reasonable doubt. This meant
a great multiplication of labor and led
to a special and Constitutional difficulty
between the Lieut.-Governor and myself,
In two cases I came to the conclusion
that there really was serious doubt as to
the guilt of the convicted person. In each
two or more persons had been tried in
company, and it seemed to me that the
jury had been carried away by the
strength of the evidence against A, and
had convicted not only him but B,
against whom, in my judgment, the evi-
dence had not been sufficient. I accord-
ingly recommended the release of the men.
In one of these cases the Chief Justice,
who was then acting as Lieut.-Governor,
strongly dissented from my views and
recommendations—not only as to the
ments of the case, but also as to the
principle upon which I was acting. He
applied the ordinary view which a Court
of Appeal would apply in a civil case —
that where a jury has decided the
decision should not be overturned unless
it could be shown to be wrong. Apart
from this altogether, his own highly
trained mind led him to conclusions
of fact other than those at which I had
arrived.
CLASH WITH
THE C.J.
S i r William
Cullen
called me
ffi> and, with his
usual kindness in
dealing with those around him, put these
considerations to me. I went away hav-
ing promised him to give them my closest
attention. It was certainly in no spirit of
stubbornness that I found myself unable
to recede from the position which I had
taken un
I laid the case aside for the moment.
A week or two later I re-read the whole
of the evidence with comparative calm
and in the light ot the observations the
Chief Justice had made. I found, how-
ever, that no clear conviction of the
men’s guilt resulted. On the contrary,
the impression driven in upon me on
this second occasion was even more
definite than before—that here the jury
had jumped at a conclusion as regards
one of two prisoners tried together,
HriT w ANI QTANn c

FIRM
The m i nute
which j then
wrote came be-
fore Lord Chelms-
ford, who had returned and resumed his
duties as Governor, and the men were
released.
The whole episode was one of extreme
difficulty for me. I was a junior member
of the Bar. I had no business actually to
be Attorney-General at all. 1 was, with
the exception of Beeby (a solicitor), the
only legal man in the Cabinet. Depart-
mental opinion on this matter was, on the
whole, against me; and that so humane
and kindly a spirit as the Chief Justice
took an entirely different view from that
which had forced itself on me was, as
can be readily understood, a most dis-
quieting thought. Nevertheless, I stuck
to my point, and I have every reason to
suppose that in one of the two cases at
any rate I was right, i.e., that the in-
nocence of the convicted person may be
regarded as established.

S. H. PRIOR MEMORIAL PRIZE
To recognise the services to Australian literature of the late Samuel
Henry Prior, editor of “The Bulletin” for 18 years, his son, H. K. Prior,
has provided £lOO per annum for a prize, to be known as the S. H. Prior
Memorial Prize, which will be awarded every year for a work of fiction.
Entries for the first competition will close on June 6, 1935, and results
will be announced within two months thereafter.
The trustees, who will supply all relevant information to intending
competitors on application, will publish the successful work, together with
any others which they may deem worthy. The winning novel will be published
within two months after the announcement of the results.
Royalties at the usual rates will be paid on sales of works so published,
in which the entrants will retain all property rights, except world book rights,
which will be controlled by the trustees.
Any bona-fide Australian resident or any person born in Australia,
New Zealand or British South Pacific islands will be eligible to enter, for
the competition, novels which must be the original work of the entrant and
previously unpublished, either wholly or in part, in book or serial form.
Manuscripts must be submitted under a nom de plume, and the true name and
address of the author must accompany each entry in a sealed envelope, which
will not be opened until the judges have made their decision.
The judges’ selections will be final, and competitors must accept as
binding the trustees’ decisions on other matters arising out of the contest.
The trustees, whose address is 252 George-street, Sydney, reserve the
right to withhold the prize if no novel submitted is, in the opinion of the
judges, worthy of an award.
petitions by distressed parents, wives or
other relatives, are addressed to the Min-
ister’s sense of humanity. It has been
the rule of the department for many
years that the Minister shall in no case
see such petitioners. I think that a most
necessary rule, and I never departed from
it.
The difficulty of any scheme of
criminal justice is, and must be, the hard-
ships inflicted upon innocent persons who
are connected with the offender. To see
those innocent sufferers in the flesh and
to be overwhelmed by their tears and sup-
plications must prevent any Minister who
is not equipped with a heart of stone
from carrying out his duties without bias.
Even with the protection of such a rule,
nearly every Minister does err on the
side of undue leniency.
SPECIAL CASES
There was one
type of case
where I never
hesitated to make remissions. These
were the cases of youthful offenders who
had made a single slip ; young men whose
conduct had been good both before and
after, but who under the pressure of
poverty or some special temptation had
yielded. I always felt that if honest em-
ployment could be found it was better
for them and for the community that
they should be out of gaol.- Such'men
are not, in any true sense of the word,
criminals or loafers. They are good men
gone astray. They have been punished ;
and the exposure and disgrace are an
almost ample guarantee that they will not
err again. They have been men of good
conduct and industry in the gaol.
Guarantors come forward who will
answer for their honesty in future, and
immediate employment will be found.
Where these were the circumstances 1
never failed to act, and, although several
of my decisions were the subject of con-
siderable hostile comment, I am satisfied
that this is the proper course to take.
THERE is a very special difficulty in an-
other type of case. A woman would
be fined, let us say, for selling milk which
had been watered, or a packet of baking
powder which did not comply with the
conditions of the Pure Foods Act.
At first sight such an offence is abso-
lutely unpardonable. It is so peculiarly
fraught with danger to the general well-
being that no considerations of leniency
ought to be permitted. Then it would
be stated on her behalf that she was a
widow struggling to support a family of
children, that she was in debt, that the
fine would be ruinous to her, and : that,
apart from this incident, she was a woman
of estimable character and blameless con-
duct, and it would be urged by a petition
of her neighbors that the fine should be
remitted. The judgment of Solomon
himself might well be distracted between
two such sets of considerations.
At first this class of case nearly drove
me insane with uncertainty, but I ulti-
mately discovered a solution which fitted
most of them. I used to put such an
offender upon probation, say, for 12
months. Payment of the fine would be
suspended for that period. If during the
12 months no other charges of the same
character were brought against her the
fine would be remitted altogether ; other-
wise not. In this way all the benefit of
the punishment as a deterrent was re-
tained, and harshness in the way of
further depleting the resources of a
struggling woman and a poverty-stricken
family was avoided.
Capital cases were, of course, always
considered by a full meeting of the
Cabinet. Every Minister was specially
summoned to be present. Other busi-
ness was laid aside, and the Judge who
had presided over the trial furnished a
preliminary report, which was circulated
to each Minister some days in advance.
The Judge also attended the gathering,
and, where necessary, police officers and
sometimes other witnesses were called
in to clear up some point on which
the Judge desired to refresh his memory.
A capital sentence is never given effect
in this State until the whole of these steps
have been taken, and in every case of
the kind which I attended the decisions
arrived at were unanimous.
DEATH OF
JUSTICE COHEN
During my
opening year in
office, the death
occurred of Mr.
Justice Cohen, of the Supreme Court,
who had been the first president of the
Industrial Arbitration Court of the State.
We filled the vacancy on new prin-
ciples. Hitherto, with one or two excep-
tions, of which the appointment of Mr.
Justice Bring had been the most note-
worthy, the Bench had always been re-
cruited from the Inner Bar. Bygone
Governments had looked round among
the K.Cs, whenever they wanted to
nominate a Supreme Court Judge, and
certain senior men were generally recog-
nised as the designated heirs apparent to
any vacancy.
An active-minded junior with a large
practice is more likely to be an oracle
of the law. At that moment, Ferguson,
of our Junior Common Law Bar, was
recognised as one of the foremost
authorities on Common Law in our State.
He had recently, too, by winning a re-
markable series of cases and getting ex-
traordinary verdicts, demonstrated that
his great legal knowledge had not put
him out of touch with human nature.
I was authorised by Cabinet to see
him and offer him the appointment. Fer-
guson had not regarded himself as quali-
fied for the Bench until he was at least 20
years older, and asked for time to con-
sider. Upon reflection, he saw that,
although in court he would have to pre-
side over the doings of many who, as
counsel, were his seniors, his standing
and authority were such as to permit of
this without risk of discontent. The
appointment was accordingly made, and
the resulting presence of Mr. Justice Fer-
guson upon the Bench continued one of
the permanent achievements of our Gov-
ernment to which no one ever objected.
When later a vacancy occurred on the
Equity side I applied similar principles
and appointed Rich, a leading junior.
This was an equally satisfactory choice,
but the State was not permitted to retain
its benefit for long. The Commonwealth
Government offered Mr. Justice Rich a
seat on the High Court Bench, which he
accepted, thus leaving us with another
vacancy. I had ceased to be Attorney-
General by this time, but Hall, who
shared my views, again made a careful
survey of all ranks and appointed
Harvey. It has never been disputed that
these appointments—the only three we
made to the Supreme Court Bench —were
anything but ideal.
DACEY’S DEATH
Dacey died
after having been
in office a little
over four months. I cannot attempt here
any expression of the sense of personal
bereavement which this death left in me.
The sense of public calamity was, I be-
lieve, universal among us.
With Macdonell we had lost a good
comrade, instinct with the frank and
careless generosity of the bushman, who
was mourned as a brother in arms. But
Dacey was a pillar of our State—one of
the sagest as well as one of the strong-
est men among us —and his loss, fol-
lowing upon those of Nielsen and Mac-
donell, made every one realise, a little
bleakly, that there was now not much
between us and the craft of our enemies.
His unshakable self-possession in crises
and his clear judgment had been price-
less assets.
No ordinary Australian Cabinet could
have stood the shock of three such losses
within eight months. Our team,
although, as I have already suggested,
one of exceptional personal strength,
reeled under these successive blows, and
for fully a year forward there was a
visible failure in energy and direction.
EFFECT ON
HOLMAN
For some
months before
Dacey’s death I
had been engaged
on a proposal intended to gain me some
measure of personal relief. The events
of the 1911 session had been exacting in
the extreme. I had frequently had to
think, literally without stopping, for days
and nights on end, only sleeping for a
few broken hours when sheer exhaus-
tion made further concentration impos-
sible. Our experiences over the Federal
powers referendum, so unexpected in
character and so humiliating in their
effect upon us, together with the bad
faith with which we had been treated by
Federal Ministers, had reacted in a
special degree upon myself, and these and
other irritations originating in the
Federal sphere had reinforced the over-
driving of our own. The return of the
leader gave me less respite than I had
looked forward to, and the loss of two
such powerful individualities as Nielsen
and Macdonell (to be shortly followed,
little as we anticipated it, by that of
Dacey) made almost daily conferences
with the Chief on general affairs un-
avoidable.
j n tfi e circumstances I consulted Hall
an( j p U t fij m t fi e proposition that he
should retire from Federal politics, where
his prospects seemed reasonably good,
an( j come over and help us. Hall con-
suhed Fisher, who condemned the idea
roundly. It struck the Federal leader's
contented mind as a piece of insanity for
Hall to leave a House where Labor was
so lidly entrenched behind a big majority,
anc j w here he had fair chances of pro-
rnotion to Ministerial rank in a reason-
afijy near future, to join up with a Gov-
eminent whose majority, numbering one
j n a p at j ts fi est moments, had an em-
barrassing habit of dematerialising at its
and which would almost certainly
come a final cropper very soon. In spite
0 f this depressing estimate of our pros-
P ects Dali decided to take a sporting
chance with us if matters could be
a ed
™ ° A . t. j . u • ♦ a
Tbe . S , tate j? arty had t ° be mtr °duced
to the ldea . ot accepting him as a Mmis-
ter over tbe beads of 37 other men,
many of whom thought, and not unrea-
sonably, that they ought to be Ministers
first : ‘.‘Safety first,” however, involved
my having some legal assistance on which
1 could rely, and the members of our
P arty ’ as a body, were sympathetic. The
fact was recognised that Ministries gener-
ally fell b f cause of a false step in con-
nection with justice Wade had been
politically slam with Peter Bowling s leg-
lrons > Wise had been thrown out tor
the contrary reason : he had let a man
out Democracy was strangely sensitive
about what happened in the Jus-
dee Department. If I were left in office,
overwhelmed as I was, I should ot
a certainty make some similar mistake
which would lead to the Government s
defeat. On the other hand, with a careful
colleague who had time to attend to
detail work the risk of mistake would
be much reduced.
This reasoning won, and as Fisher
felt secure enough to spare one of his
supporters until he could be replaced the
change was made. How strangely de-
ceptive appearances proved! The Fisher
Government lost its large majority and
was thrown out at the next elections,
whilst Hall and myself continued in office
together uninterruptedly for more than
eight years,

Bilious
Attacks
Most of us know the symptoms of
Biliousness that awful Head Dizzi-
ness-Furred Tongue—perhaps Vomit-
ing and a general feeling of Languor.
The liver is upset probably from over-
indulgence in rich food or drink or
eating the wrong type of food. Perhaps,
too, the liver is inclined to be sluggish,
and made worse by this trying weather.
Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills have long
been recognised as the ideal remedy for
Biliousness. They stir the liver to healthy
action, cleanse and stimulate the bowels,
regulate the digestion and tone up the
system,
TRY THEM TO-NIGHT.
WORMS
A COMMON COMPLAINT WITH
CHILDREN—HOW TO TREAT IT.
Worms, by their movements and the inter-
ruption they offer to the contents of the
Bowels, generally occasion pain or uneasiness
in the Abdomen, sometimes spasmodic, some-
times gnawing and biting, and not infrequently
of a vague, indescribable character, and yet
very distressing. Sympathetic with this is a
sensation of itching at the Nostrils, producing
a disposition to pick the Nose, which is charac-
teristic of the affection. The Bowels are often
disordered, sometimes relaxed, as in Dysentery.
The appetite is exceedingly variable; in some
cases natural, in others deficient, craving or
depraved, one condition not infrequently alter-
nating with another. The Abdomen is often
hard, swollen, and tympanetic, the breath heavy
or foetid, and tongue furred, with disagreeable
taste, and a copious flow of saliva; swelling
of the upper lip, bleeding of the nostrils, and
disposition to grind the teeth during the sleep
are other characteristic symptoms. The effects
however, often extend beyond the Alimentary
Canal, and various derangements of health
are experienced in consequence, either of the
direct irritation of the worms or of the dis-
ordered digestion which they occasion. Amongst
the most common of these are nervous affec-
tions, such as fretfulness, irritation of temper,
wakefulness or disposition to excessive sleep,
disturbed sleep, sudden starting out of sleep
as if from fright, dizziness, spasmodic move-
ments of the eyelids, temporary blindness and
deafness.
Unfortunately, many mothers fail to recog-
nise the fact that their little ones have worms,
are suffering intense pain and distress, and are
practically irresponsible for the outbursts of
temper, restlessness and peevishness, and until
some more serious symptoms appear nothing is
done to alleviate the distress. The symptoms of
this disease are somewhat variable, but gener-
ally they are so characteristic that no mother
need have any doubts. The best proof of
worms is worms, and if the general conduct
of the child is such as to give the slightest
suspicion a careful watch will afford ample
proof.
A child who is affected with Thread Worms
will often appear to the eye to be in an
indifferent state of health. It becomes peevish
and irritable in its temper. Another point
to which the attention of mothers should be
specially directed is that the child is apt to
start in its sleep, its repose being in the way
of a disturbed nature.
Comstock’s “Dead Shot” Worm Pellets are
a purely vegetable medicinal preparation com-
pounded on a scientific principle for the
eradication of worms which infest the intes-
tines. They contain specific properties which
destroy the worms, but cause no injury to
the Stomach or Bowels, and do not weaken
the system. The pellets are prepared in the
form of a confection or lolly, have no dis-
agreeable taste or smell, but, on the contrary,
inspire children to take them as they would
an ordinary sweet. '
