The City of Dreadful Night.
Canto IY.
He stood alone within the spacious square
declaiming from, the central grassy mound,
With head uncovered and with streaming hair,
As if large multitudes were gathered round:
A stalwart shape, the gestures full of might,
The glances burning with unnatural light :—
As I came through the desert thus it was,
As I came through the desert: All was- black,
In heaven no single star, on earth no traok ;
A brooding hush without a stir or note,
The air so thick it clotted in my throat;
And thus for hours; then some enormous things
Swooped past with savage cries and clanking
wings:
But I strode on austere;
No hope could have no fear.
As I came through the desert thus it was,
As I came through the desert: Eyes of fire
Glared at me throbbing with a starved desire;
The hoarse and heavy and carnivorous breath
Was hot upon me from deep jaws of death ;
Sharp claws, swift talons, fleshless fingers cold
Plucked at me from the bushes, tried to hold :
But I strode on austere;
No hope could have no fear.
As I came through the desert thus it was,
As I came through the desert: Lo you, there,
That hillock burning with a brazen glare;
Those myriad dusky flames with points aglow
Which writhed and hissed and darted to and fro ;
A Sabbath of the Serpents, heaped pell-mell
For Devil’s roll-call and some fete of Hell:
Yet I strode on austere ;
No hope could have no fear.
As I came through the desert thus it was,
As I came through the desert: Meteors ran
And crossed their javelins on the black sky-span ;
The zenith opened to a gulf of flame,
The dreadful thunderbolts jarred earth’s fixed
frame ;
The ground all heaved in waves of fire that surged
And weltered round me there sole unsubmerged :
Yet I strode on austere;
No hope could have no fear.
As I came through the desert thus it was,
As I came through the desert: Air once more,
And I was close upon a wild sea-shore;
Enormous cliffs arose on either hand,
The deep tide thundered up a league-broad strand ;
White foambelts seethed there, wan spray swept
and flew;
The sky broke, moon and stars and clouds and
blue:
And I strode on austere ;
No hope could have no fear.
As I came through the desert thus it was,
As I came through the desert; On the left
The sun arose and crowned a broad crag-cleft;
There stopped and burned out black, except a. rim,
A bleeding eyeless socket, red and dim ;
Whereon the moon fell suddenly south-west,
And stood above the right-hand cliffs at rest:
Still I strode on austere;
No hope could have no fear.
As I came through the desert thus it was,
As I came through the desert: From the right
A shape came slowly with a ruddy light;
A woman with a red lamp in her hand,
Bareheaded and barefooted on that strand ;
O desolation moving with such grace !
O anguish with such beauty in thy face 1
I fell as on my bier,
Hope travailed with such fear.
As I came through the desert thus it was,
As I came through the desert: I was twain,
Two selves distinct that cannot join again ;
One stood apart and knew, but could not stir,
And watched the other stark in swoon and her;
And she came on, and never turned aside,
Between such sun and moon and roaring tide :
And as she came more near
My soul grew mad with fear.
As I came through the desert thus it was,
As I came through the desert: Hell is mild
And piteous matched with that accursed wild ;
A large black sign was on her breast that bowed,
A broad black band ran down her snow-white
shroud ;
That lamp she held was her own burning heart,
Whose blood-drops trickled step by step aoart •
The mystery was clear ;
Mad rage had swallowed fear.
As I came through the desert thus it was,
As I came through the desert: By the sea
She knelt and bent above that senseless me;
Those lamp-drops fell upon my white brow there,
She tried to cleanse them with her tears and hair •
She murmured words of pity, love, and woe,
She heeded not the level rushing flow:
And mad with rage and foar,
I stood stonebound so near.
As I came through the desert thus it was,
As I came through the desert: When the tide
Swept up to her there kneeling by my side,
She clasped that corpse-like me, and they were
borne
Away, and this vile me was left forlorn;
I know the whole sea cannot quench that heart,
Or cleanse that brow, or wash those two apart:
They love ; their doom is drear,
Yet they nor hope nor fear;
But I, what do I here ?
———
Canto XXI.
Anear the centre of that northern crest
Stands out aJevel upland bleak and bare,
From which the city east and south and west
Sinks gently in long waves; and throned there
An Image sits, stupendous, superhuman,
The bronze colossus of a winged Woman,
Upon a graded granite base foursquare.
Low-seated she leans forward massively,
With cheek on clenched left hand, the forearm’s
might
Erect, its elbow on her rounded knee ;
Across a clasped book in her lap the right
Upholds a pairof compasses ; she gazes
With full set eyes, but warfderirig in thick mazes
Of sombre thought beholdsTio-outward sight.
Words cannot picture her ; but all men know
That solemn sketch the pure sad artist wrought
Three centuries and threescore years ago,
With phantasies of his peculiar thought:
The instruments of carpentry and science
Scattered about her feet, in strange alliance
With the keen wolf-hound*sleeping undistraughc ;
Scales, hour-glass, bell, and magic-square above:
Ihe grave and solid infant perched beside,
With open winglets that might bear a dove,
Intent upon its tablets, heavy-eyed ;
Her folded wings as of a mighty eagle,
But all too impotent to lift the regal
Robustness of her earth-born strength and pride :
And with those wings, and that light wreath
which seems
To mock her grand head and the knotted frown
Of forehead charged with baleful thoughts and
dreams,
The household bunch of keys, the housewife’s
gown
Voluminous, indented, and yet rigid
As if a shell of burnished metal frigid,
The feet thick shod to tread all weakness down;
The comet hanging o’er the waste dark seas,
The massy rainbow curved in front of it,
Beyond the village with the masts and trees :
Ihe snaky imp, dog-headed, from the Pit,
Bearing upon its batlike leathern pinions
Her name unfolded in the sun’s dominions,
The “ Melancolia ” that transcends all wit.
Thus has the artist copied her, and thus
Surrounded to expound her form sublime^
Her fate heroic and calamitous ;
Fronting the dreadful mysteries of Time,
Unvanquished in defeat and desolation,
Undaunted in the hopeless conflagration
Of the day setting on her baffled prime.
Baffled and beaten back she works on still,
Weary and sick of soul she works the more,
Sustained by her indomitable will:
The hands shall fashion and the brain shall pore
mm/ 11 u sorr °w shall be turned to labour,
I ill death, the friend-foe, piercing with his sabre
I hat mighty heart of hearts ends bitter war.
But as if blacker night could dawn on night,
With tenfold gloom on moonless night unstarred,
A sense more tragic than defeat and blight,
More desperate than strife with hope debarred.
More fatal than the adamantine Never
Encompassing her passionate endeavor,
Dawns glooming in her tenebrous regard :
The sense that every struggle brings defeat
Because I ate holds no prize to crown success ;
Ihat all the oracles are dumb or cheat
Because they have no secret to express;
That none can pierce the vast black veil uncer-
tain
Because there is no light beyond the curtain :
Ihat all is vanity and nothingness.
Titanic from her high throne in the north,
I hat City’s sombre Patroness and Queen,
In bronze sublimity she gazes forth
Over her capital of teen and threne,
Over the river with its isles and bridges,
I he marsh and moorland, to the stern rook-ridges
Confronting them with a coeval mien.
The moving moon and stars from east to west
Circle before her in the sea of air;
Shadows and gleams glide round her solemn rest.
Her subjects often gaze up to her there:
The strong to drink new strength of iron endur-
ance,
The weak new terrors ; all, renewed assuranoe
And confirmation of the old despair.
James Thomson.
“The City of Dreadful Night” is only one
among many poems by James Thomson which
justify warm praise and permanent admiration ;
but it is that one with which his name is most
often associated, and that one also which is most
thoroughly distinctive of his talent. He is as well
represented in other of his writings, but nowhere
more characteristically represented.
James Thomson, the second English poet of the
name, was by birth Scotch, and his parents were
Scotch. The father was intemperate ; the mother
a religious enthusiast. Thomson became a school-
master in the army ; gained a friend in Brad-
laugh, and a lover in an armourer-sergeant’s
daughter who died young, clouding Thomson’s
spirit with a lifelong grief. It is clear, however,
that lost love was only the secondary cause of the
melancholy which always pursued 'him, and that
his early pessimism and his later drink-craving
were the results of inherited disease.
Thomson left the army at 28 years of age ; was
for a time in a solicitor’s office ; and for years con-
tributed verse and prose to the London press—
chiefly to the National Reformer. In 1872 he
visited Colorado, America, to report on a silver'
mine, and shortly after was for two months the
New York World's correspondent in Spain, during
the Carlist war. He rar-ely succeeded in earning
more than a bare livelihood ; his nerves failed
under hardships, and he became a confirmed
drunkard ; and gradually he dragged himself to
death in 1882, in the 48th year of his struggle.
Thomson’s poems are published by Reeves and
Turner, London, in two volumes at 6s. each;
there is a third volume of his “ Biographical and
Critical ” prose. His life was written by H. S.
Salt, and J. M. Robertson edited—not ably or sym-
pathetically—a selection of “Poems, Essays, and
Fragments.” Bertram Dobell, Thomson’s friend
and admirer, whose memoir is prefixed to
the two-volume edition, is rather worshipper
than critic; but his useful devotion does
him credit. Several of Thomson’s poems were
published during his lifetime, and some of his
prose : these books and booklets are now out of
print, and are rendered unnecessary by the hand-
some collected edition—which still does not in-
clude all Thomson’s writings. Anybody who has
seen Henry Cargill, “ The Dipsomaniac ” of The
Bulletin, will have a good idea of Thomson’s
personal appearance : the resemblance is as close
as that of J. A. Andrews, “ the Australian anar-
chist’’(though he now disclaims the label), to the
portraits of Verlaine.
James Thomson is a poet who has not yet come
into his kingdom. He is assuredly entitled to
rank with the greater English poets of this cen-
tury, yet even to “ educated ” people he is hardly
known. The atmosphere in which he wrote is
chiefly responsible for this. Thomson never
caught the conventional English tone ; he
was never Respectable, his . intellect raises
him high above the level of the audience
captivated by Tennyson ; and his hatred of the
priestly Lie and the kingly Lie was so sincere and
outspoken that he was inevitably tabooed by a
“religious” and “loyal” community. Yet his
work is so splendid that it is impossible to kill it
by silence or neglect. It is surely reserved for
the noblest perpetuity.
As a poet, Thomson was too .intellectual to
reach the highest imaginative rank. He is rarely
lyrical; he warms it is less with emo-
tion than with thought so intense that it kindles
into flame. His work has the effect of sculpture
rather than of painting, though the sculpture is
?A fcen tinted into a closer approximation of
me. He ls always too human to be hard
or , yet his work would seem hard and
cold it it were not for the sincere man glowing
through it. He was a poet of the Ear rather than
or the Eye, eloquent and lucid, yet rarely potent
to picture vividly. For majestic rhetoric he is
unsurpassed. Milton has no deeper note ' even
Swinburne’s decorative resonance, poetically finer,
is not often so strongly, magnificently soncfrous
as the closing canto of “The City,” where
Thomson literally “ booms ” like surf on a
hollow sea-shore. No one has more inevitable
epithets than Thomson, or a greater mastery over
cadence ; and the loftier his subject the more
iottiiy his language rises to meet it. He is a
master of massive, slowly-moving melody.
Yet, and even at his best, it is rather an atmos-
phere than a thought which Thomson conveys :
one passes through “The City of Dreadful Night ”
and receives, not a strong idea, but a strong im-
pression. It is his mood which dominates you,
not his message. It may be argued that for this
very reason Thomson is all the more poet, and the
argument may be formidably supported. And
ydfc . . . one feels a lack. In Egypt they
?h°w you the mighty temples of a van-
lshed age, sombre, majestic, magnificent,
ihe vast halls, interminable corridors, columns
like great trees, are inexpressibly wonder-
i ’ ® l^“er torch-lighted or unburied to the
cloudless sky. They bring strange and grand
emotions, yet emotions somehow alien from the
pondering spectator. One cannot forget them ;
y® . • • • what is it they have given us ? Not a
thrill, not a thought—an intangible, inscrutable
mood.
It it often so in the best poems of James Thom-
son. So far as it is capable of definition and
analysis, their grandeur seems for the most part
barren. The thrill, the thought, do come occa-
sionally, but their characteristic impression is an
impression of solemn archways, lofty pinnacles,
magnificent chambers, and about them the stern
and gloomy silence of the desert.
* * * •
Yet there is another side to Thomson—a side
which composed verses that are graceful and
something more : like these—
THE FIRE THAT TILLED MY HEART OF OLD.
The Are that filled my heart of old
Gave lustre while it burned ;
Now only ashes grey and cold
Are in its silence urned.
Ah ! better was the_ furious flame,
The splendour with the smart :
I never cared for the singer’s fame,
But, oh ! for the singer's heart
Once more—
The burning fulgent heart !
No love, no hate, no hope, no fear,
No anguish and no mirth ;
Thus life extends from year to year,
A flat of sullen dearth.
Ah ! life’s blood creepeth cold and tame,
Life’s thought plays no new part :
I never cared for the singer’s fame,
But, oh ! for the singer’s heart
Once more—
The bleeding passionate heart!
Then Thomson was learned in French, in, Ger-
man, in Italian : no one has surpassed his transla-
tions of the untranslatable Heine. Here is his
“ Loreley ”
THE LORELEY.
I know not what evil is coming,
But my heart feels sad and cold ;
A song in my head keeps humming,
A tale from the times of old.
The air is fresh and it darkles,
And smoothly flows the Rhine ;
The peak of the mountain sparkles
In the fading sunset-shine.
The loveliest wonderful Maiden
On high is sitting there,
- With golden jewels braiden,
And she combs her golden hair.
With a golden comb sits combing,
And ever the while sings she
A marvellous song through the gloaming
Of magical melody.
It hath caught the boatman, and bound him
In the spelt of a wild sad love ;
He sees not the rocks around him,
He sees only her above.
The waves through the pass sweep swinging,
But boatman or boat i 8 none ;
And this with her mighty singing
The Lorbley hath done.
Thomson wrote epigrams, too :
How many a noble father, since Agamemnon sinned,
Has sacrificed his daughter just to raise the wind !
A good all-round verse workman, in fact, with a
mind tuned to the humorous, the pathetio, and
always to the true and noble.
» * * *
Thompson’s critical prose is hardly less good in
its way than his verse. He saw clearly, felt
keenly, and wrote eloquently. No one has extolled
poetry more fitly and suggestively.
The only true or inspired poetry is always from within,
not from without. The experience obtained in it • has
been spiritually transmuted from lead into gold. It is
severely logical, the most trivial of its adornments being
subservient to and suggested by the dominant idea, any
departure from whose dictates would be the “falsifying
of a revelation.” It Is unadulterated with worldly wisdom,
deference to prevailing opinions, mere talent or clever-
ness. Its anguish is untainted by the gall of bitterness,
its joy is never selfish, its grossness is never obscene. It
perceives always the profound identity underlying all
surface differences. It is a living organism, not a dead
aggregate, and its music is the expression of the law of
its growth ; so that it could no more be set to a different
melody than could a rose-tree be consummated with lilies
or violets. It is most philosophic when most enthusiastic,
the clearest light of it* wisdom being shed from th*
keenest fire of its love. It is a synthesis not arithmetical,
but algebraical; that is to say, its particular subjects are
universal symbols, it predicates universal laws ; hence it
is infinitely suggestive. It is ever-fresh wonder at the
infinite mystery, ever-young faith in the eternal soul.
Whatever be its mood, we feel that it is not self-possessed
but God-possessed ; whether the God came down serene
and stately as Jove, when, a swan, he wooed Leda ; or
With overwhelming might insupportably burning, as when
he consumed Semele.
And, though the Tennyson controversy is over,
see how Thomson anticipated it in 1863, when the
Commonplace Poet was at the height of his Art.
Thomson is discussing the peculiar simplicity, the
childlike emotion in - the face of the universe,
which we find in Blake and Shelley.
Tennyson has no more of this simplicity than had
Byron : his chief youthful fault was such a young-ladyish
affectation as could not exist together with it. But he is
fully aware of its value, and woos it like a lover, in vain,
as Byron wooed it in the latter parts of “ Childe Harold ”
and in “ Manfred.” Perhaps each of them should be
credited with one great exception, in addition to a few
short lyrics : Tennyson with the “ Lotus Eaters,” Byron
with the “ Dream.” Scarcely any other artist in verse of
the same rank has ever lived oh such scanty revenues ol
thought (both pure, and applied or mixed) as Tennyson.
While it cannot be pretended that he is a great sculptor,
he is certainly an exquisite carver of luxuries in
ivory ; but we must be content to admire the
caskets, for there are no jewels inside. His
meditation at the best is that of a good leading-
article ;heis a pensioner on the thought of his age. He
is continually petty with that littleness of the second
degree which makes a man brag aloud in avoiding some
well-known littleness of the first degree. His nerves are
so weak that any event —a Crimean War or a Volunteer
movement—sets him off in hysterics. Nothing gives one
a keener insight into the want of robustness in the edu-
cated English intellect of the age than the fact that nine-
tenths of our best-known literary men look upon him as
a profound philosopher. When wax flowers are oracular
oaks, Dodona may be discovered in the Isle of Wight,
but hardly until then. Mr. Matthew Arnold’s definition
of “distilled thought in distilled words" was surely sug-
gested by the processes and productions of a fashionable
perfumer. A great school of the poets is dying out; it
will die decently, elegantly, in the full odour of respect-
ability, with our Laureate.
* ♦ • *
So the works of J ames Thomson in verse and
prose are to be commended again and many times
again. He is the aggressive Matthew Arnold of
English literature—of the same critical kin, the
same poetic race—but as positive as Arnold was
negative, and nestling as closely to one’s head as
Arnold to one’s heart.
E. E. Slosson gets home on log-rolling Andrew
Lang in Chicago Dial —
It is to be expected that a critic will err, but we wish
he would not boast of his errancy as Mr. Andrew Lang did
a few months ago. His attention was called to the fact
that a book he had condemned in a few careless words
as unworthy of notice had proved a literary success and
m his gracefully facetious way he explains that a critic
has so little time to give to reading that he cannot be
expected to know whether a book is good or not, and that
for his part he does not care whether his Judgments are
correct or false.
This confession disturbed me a good deal, for I had been
relying on Mr. Lang’s criticisms for many vears. A book
he condemned I always read ; and if he attacked a book
savagely I bought it at once, for I knew it must be
worth ovyning. By following this rule I have acquired
ase ect library of the world's best literature with not a
trashy volume in it. But when he says he does not know
and does not care whether the books he reviews are good
or bad, my faith in his negative infallibility is rudely
shaken. I may miss some important work through a
neglected condemnation on his part.

Literature says the right word about Alice Mey-
nell s “ precious ” essays :
n? 1 . 6 * act rerna ' ns that Mrs. Meynell is not, and never
will be, an essayist of the first rank. The world takes an
essayist to its heart not because of the writer's amazing
cleverness, nor even because of original thoughts dec£
rated with the most charmingly chosen epithets, but
because it can feel the personality behind the leaves of
the book Behind “ The Spirit of Place ” the world may
possibly delect some shadow beuignly condescending from
a higher sphere, but jf will hardly feel in touch with a
human personality. We are privileged, as it were to
partner a dainty figure, in antiquated but becoming cos-
tume, as she walks gracefully though the intricacies of
some old-fashioned dance. It is excellently well done,
and we do not withhold our admiration, but with all her
courtesies we have riot advanced to any intimacy. We
nuist still keep our distance. It is possible, in literature
this sort of politeness.
the Spirit of Place” is a dainty book, containing
seventeen tiny discourses in not many more than a hun-
dred pages. The writing throughout is after the best
models ; now we come upon a passage that might have
been written by Lamb, now upon a phrase that
" av ® sapped out of “Virginibus Puerisque.”
Mis. Meynell could, without doubt, write you an essav in
the manner of Bacon, or of Addison, and do it to admira-
tion. Possibly she would gain more readers if she wrote
more naturally, and less with the air of one who was
weaving her words, with curious art, into a rare pattern.
But even then—the defect lies deeper than mere words—
the mind is aloof from this world and its poor humanity,
bhei can write tenderly of beggars, but the tenderness is
academic. It is the academic spirit, we fear, that will
prevent Mrs. Meynell from writing anything of permanent
value in the essay form.

W. H. Malyon, Esq., Man. Chemist, Ballarat.
Dear Sir, —For years past (about ten), I have been
troubled with “ Acne ” in its worst form, and have sought
advice from the best Australian and London doctors, with
only fair results. A Victorian friend of mine, some four
or five weeks ago, sent me a tin of your “ Ligmolliene,’'
and speaking very highly of its wonderful curative powers.
1 naturally look same “ Cum Grano Snlis,” and was in-
clined not to use it ; eventually I tried your ointment
with truly marvellous results, and am now entirely cured ;
and think people who suffer from skin diseases are greatly
indebted to you for your wonderful remedy. I shall
advise all my friends with skin troubles to use same.
Wishing “ Ligomolliene ” all the success it richly deserves,
Yours faithfully, GEORGE J. O’REGAN.

some years under the prescription of Professor M'Call
Anderson and other eminent dermatologists, with only
partial and temporary relief. When I met you I com-
menced somewhat sceptically your ointment Ligmolliene,
and after about two months’ treatment I may honestly say
my enemy is defeated, and I am perfectly well. I will only
add that since I commenced the treatment of myself I have
prescribed it to others, and am still doing so with brilliant
results. Please accept my hearty thanks, and remain yours
sincerely, THOS. LE GAY lIOLTHOUSE, M.R.C.S., L.

Army, Camp Merritt, San Francisco, June 9, 1898. Last
October, while in garrison at Fort Bliss, El Paso, Texas,

Yours gratefully, John P. Anderson.”

ATTENTION, PLEASE!
WHY are the Preparations manufactured by E. HOL-
LAND, Hair Specialist, superior to and in erreater de-
mand than all other Preparations for promoting the growth
and restoring the color to the Hair ? Because they are the
result of a practical knowledge-20 years’ experience—of all
the Diseases of the Hair, and what is necessary to remove
them. Whereas nearly all other preparations are manufac-
tured by quacks, and are nothing but quack nostrums.
A gentleman in writing says : —“ Everywhere I go I hear
people speaking highly of your Preparations for the Hair.”
Another gentleman says “ By a mere chance I have had
a good opportunity of witnessing the good effect of your now
well-known Hair Restorer. A friend of mine since boyhood
&
MYii
was quite bald on top of head, and, to my knowledge, tried most things mentioned without any result. A few months
ago he informed me he was intending to give vour Restorer a trial. Of course I laughed, and for which you must for-
give me I did not see my friend again until a few days ago, and, if you can, judge my surpnseon finding my old corn-
fade not with a bald head, but with a full, thick head of hair.”-P. J. CONNORS, Esq., Tooma, N.S.W. 20 9 97.
PRICE, per Bottle, 3s., 4s., 5s., 10s. 6d, 12s. 6d. Ninepence (small) and Is. extra for postage. Sold by all Chemists.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A Queen of Yore.
Slowly she hobbles past the town
Grown old at heart and gray,
With misty eyes she stumbles down
Along the well-known way.
She sees her maiden march unrolled
By billabong and bend,
And every gum’s a comrade old
And every oak’s a friend ;
But gone the smiling faces
That welcomed her of yore,
They crowd her tented places
And hold her hand no more.
And she, the friend they loved to trust
To serve their eager wish,
Shall show no more the golden dust
That hides in many a dish.
And through the dismal mullock-heaps
She threads her mournful way
Where here and there some greybeard keeps
His windlass-watch to-day.
Half-flood no more she looses
Her reins, as once of old,
To wash the busy sluices
And whisper through the gold.
She sees no wild-eyed steers above
Stand, spear-horned, on the brink ;
The brumby mobs she used to love
Come down no more to drink ;
Where green the grasses used to twine
Above them, shoulder-deep,
Through the red dust, a long, slow line,
Crawl now the starving sheep ;
She sees no crossing cattle
That Western drovers bring,
No swimming steeds that battle
To block them when they ring.
She sees no barricaded roofs,
No loop-holed station wall,
No foaming steed with flying hoofs
To bring the word “ Ben Hall ! ”
She sees no reckless robbers stoop,
Behind their ambush-stone,
No coach-and-four, no escort troop—
But, very lorn and lone,
Watches the sunsets redden
Along the mountain side,
Where, round the spurs of Weddin,
The wraiths of Weddin ride.
Tho’ fettered with her earthern bars,
And chained with bridge and weir,
She goes her own way by the stars —
She knows the course to steer !
And when her thousand rocky rills
Foam angry to her feet,
Rain-heavy from the Cowra hills,
She takes her vengeance sweet,
And leaps with roar of thunder
And buries bridge and ford,
That all the world may wonder
When the Lachlan bares her sword.
* * * *
Gray River ! Let me take your hand
For all your memories old,
Your cattle-kings, your outlaw-band,
Your wealth of virgin gold,
For once you held, and hold it now,
The sceptre of a queen,
And still upon your furrowed brow
Your royal wreaths are green ;
Hold wide your arms, the waters ;
Lay bare your silver breast,
To nurse the sons and daughters
Of your kingdom in the West !
WILL H. OGILVIE.
“The Mallee Fire.”
I suppose it just depends on where you’re raised.
Once I met a cove as swore by green belar !
Couldn’t sight the good old mallee-stump I
praised :
"Well —l couldn’t sight belar, and there you are !
But the faces in the fire where the mallee-stump’s
a-blinking
Are the friendliest I ever seen, to my way o’
thinking !
In the city where the fires is mostly coal —
There ! I can’t abear to go and warm my feet !
Spitting, fizzing things as hasn’t got no soul !
Things as puffs out yaller smoke instead of heat!
But at home well, it is home when the mallee-
stump’s a-burning
And the evening’s drawing chilly and the season is
a-turning !
And there’s some as runs them down because
they’re tough.
Well ? And what’s the good of anythink as ain’t?
No. It’s nary use to serve ’em any bluff,
For they’d use up all the patience of a saint.
But they’ll split as sweet as sugar if you know the
way to take ’em.
If you don’t, there isn’t nothink in the world as’ll
make ’em !
They’re tremenjus hard to kindle, tho’, at first:
Like a friendship of the kind as comes to stay.
You can blow and blow and blow until you burst,
And when they won’t, they won’t burn, anyway !
But when once they gets a start, tho’ they make
no showy flashes,
Well, they’ll serve you true and honest to the last
pinch of ashes !

The Legend.
IT was in the summer of 1778, Wash-
ington, with his army ever active,
determined to oppose the British
general, Sir Henry Clinton, who, having
evacuated Philadelphia, was retreating
through New Jersey on New York. The
forces met on 28th June at Monmouth.
La Payette conducted the attack. The
heat was so intense that some refused to
fight, and many fell dead from exposure
to the sun’s rays. Both sides fought
desperately. As the day waned, and the
flagging spirits of La Fayette’s soldiers
were at a low ebb, a strange sight aroused
them. Marching with drum and fife
was an old man, Jeremiah Wynton, and
his son, and grandson. The old father,
with silvery flowing locks, sturdily strode
through the field. The son with ban-
daged head fifing lustily, the youth,
catching the spirit of his grandsire, rolled
out with him the soul-inspiring rattle of
the drum. Father, son, and grandson
had accompanied the troops as volunteei s,
and were ever in the forefront of the
fight. The fierce light of battle was in
their eyes, they knew no fear, and many
a wild cheer arose, as on that fateful
day Yankee Doodle was heard as never
was heard before or since.

SATURDAY, MAY 6, 1899.
Some Federal Precedents.
Precedent, as a rule, is a dreary and back-
ward thing, and no community which is a
slave to it was ever progressive, or is ever
likely to be. For the doctrine of precedent,
when carried to its fullest development, is
based on the theory that no one should have
a perfectly new idea, and that the world in
general should keep close to the safe but
mildewed ways of its forefathers. Still,
after a fashion, precedents have their uses,
and The Bulletin proposes to dig up a few.
The New South Wales provincialist party is
never tired of lamenting in the huge general
ear that certain things in the proposed
Federal Constitution are new, outrageous,
unprecedented, contrary to the old tough,
corned and seasoned experience of this great
world, and calculated to bring the proposed
Commonwealth to ruin. The principal of
these are the equal representation of the
large and small States in the Senate, the
fact that the Legislature or the people can't
alter the Constitution at its pleasure by
a bare majority, and the fact that the
capital isn't to be planted on the open sea-
coa’st at Sydney. And it is interesting to
look up the practice of some of the old,
time-worn, weather-beaten Federal States
—the ones that have braved the battle and
the breeze—and see whether the provin-
cialist argument is true, or whether the
brothers Dibbs and Heydon, also Haynes,
M‘Laughlin, M‘Laurin, Kohen, G. Pile’s
dog, the editor of the Telegraph, and
other raw wiseacres who are now trying
their prentice hand at constitution-making,
and, therefore, know all about it, are really
even more foolish than they look.
There are, in this world, one federal em-
pire (Germany), a semi-federal empire (Aus-
tria-Hungary), a federated colony (Canada),
and 13 more or less federal republics
(Switzerland, United States, Mexico, Argen-
tina, Bolivia, Chili, Columbia, Ecuador,
Nicaragua, Peru, Uruguay, Venezuela,
and Brazil). Of these, Switzerland is
the oldest federal State, the most
liberal and progressive, and incomparably
the best governed. Also, it is practically
the creator of the Federal idea in modern
times. Switzerland gives every canton equal
representation in its Upper House—Berne,
with 541,000 people, Zurich with 351,000,
and Vaud with 256,000 have exactly the
same representation as Uri with 17,000,
Zug with 23,000, and Glarus with 33 000.
The difference between Bern at one end and
Uri at the other is four times greater than
that between New South Wales at one end
of the Australian scale and Westralia at the
other, but the old enduring Swiss republic
finds the arrangement work well enough.
The United States also, has equal State re-
presentation in its Upper House ; so have all
the other republics mentioned Mexico,
Argentina, Brazil, Bolivia, Chili, Columbia,
Ecuador, Nicaragua, Peru, Uruguay, and
v enezula. In the United States there are
great discrepancies, but old Delaware, with
168,000 inhabitants, and its close neighbors,
New York with 6,000,000, and Pennsylvania
with 5,250,000, are equally represented—and
yet nothing bursts.
* * * (
Austria-Hungary also gives equal repre-
sentation to its two kingdoms in the supreme
Legislature. And the only two Federations
where the States are not equally represented
in the Upper House are two of very short
standing the new German empire and
Canada. In the German Bundesrath, Prussia
has 17 members for 32,000,000 people, and
Schaumberg-Lippe has one for 41,000, so the
latter has, in proportion to population, 750
times its arithmetically-correct share of re-
presentation in the Upper House, while
Westralia, as compared with New South
Wales, is to have eight times its arithmeti-
cally correct share. So, as far as equal State
representation in the Federal Senate is con-
cerned, every Federation in the world, bar
Canada and Germany, is based on the al-
legedly unfair and impossible system pro-
posed in Australia, and Germany is success-
fully built on one vastly more impossible.
And the inevitable dreadful consequences
don’t come.
* * « »
But the Australian Commonwealth Consti-
tution is really more liberal in its treatment
of the large states than that of any Federal
republic at present existing. In the pro-
posed Australian Senate, undoubtedly Tas-
mania and Westralia could outvote" New
South Wales by two to one. In the Lower
House New South Wales could outvote them
by five to two. But the deadlock thus
caused would be met by a joint sitting of the
two Houses, and at that joint sitting New
South Wales could wipe out both Tasmania
and Westralia and have nine votes to spare.
In other Federations the House of equal
State representation can hold its own against
the second chamber—in the proposed Aus-
tralian Constitution it can’t. These points
may not matter much, but so far as pre-
cedents go they at least amount to this :
(1) When the provincial party talks of the
equal State representation in the Senate as a
new and hideously unjust innovation, it is
lying: out of the 16 Federations of the wmrld,
14 are built on that plan, including the most-
enduring Federation in the world and the one
always quoted as the model Commonwealth
of the crowd—Switzerland. (2) When the
same crow r d talks of this system as meaning
inevitable ruin it is lying, else Switzer-
land, the United States/ Mexico, Chili,
Argentina and all the other states on the
list quoted above would have broken
down long ago. The Federal Convention,
when it devised the scheme of equal State
representation in the Senate, stuck to the
old, safe, conservative, long-established pre-
cedents of Federalism—the precedents which
the wear and tear of ages has proved to be
workable. The only departure which it
made was in favor of the large States—by
authorising the joint sitting, at which the
equality of the States in the Senate can be
over-ruled.
• • « »
As regards the provision for possible
alterations of the Constitution, the Federal
Convention adopted the Swiss model—the
model of the only Federal State which has
braved the storms of centuries, and one
which is quoted all the world over as an
example of liberalism. In Switzerland the
Federal Constitution can be altered with the
assent of a majority of the States and a
majority of the voters who go to the poll.
In Australia it is proposed to adopt the
same principle. The Swiss Constitution has
been amended under this system, though
the anti-Bill crowd says that the system
makes amendment impossible. In Germany
the Constitution can only be altered with
the assent of two-thirds of the Bundesrath—
the House where the small States are so
enormously over-represented. In the United
States amendments of the Constitution must
be demanded by two-thirds of the States, or
two-thirds of both Houses of the Federal
Legislature, and must be accepted by three-
fourths of the States before they can become
law. Most of the South American Federa-
tions followed the United States model in
this respect, so here again the proposed Aus-
tralian Constitution stuck closely to prece-
dent—only among two or three old-estab-
lished precedents it selected the most
liberal.
* * * *
But one thing for which there is practi-
cally no precedent is the truculent demand
of Sydney—only the second largest city of
Australasia—to be the capital. In Great
Britain, France, Spain, Portugal, Sweden,
Norway, Russia, Denmark, Belgium, Tur-
key, Greece, Austria, Mexico, Brazil, Chili,
Peru, Argentina, China, Japan, and the
great majority of other countries, the capital
has been fixed in the largest city, and, ac-
cording to the vast majority of precedents,
Melbourne should be the political centre of
Australia. On the other hand, the great bulk
of precedent is against the insane idea of
planting the Federal city on an open and
practically indefensible sea-shore ; this tells
against all the Australian capitals, but as
Sydney is the only one of them that is de-
manding to be made the political centre of
the Commonwealth, it tells against Sydney
especially. In all the world outside Austra-
lia the only political capitals which have
been planted on the open shore, so that the
Government could be scattered and the
Treasury snatched by the first invader, are
Lisbon, Stockholm, Copenhagen, Rio
Janeiro, Buenos Ayres, and Monte Video.
And, as most of the great capitals of the
world were the outcome of much experience
in stormy days, and were selected by men
who knew a good deal more about the exi-
gencies of war and invasion than Dibbs and
Heydon and the other unwarlike exponents
of anti-Bill, it is just possible that these
ancients weren’t all quite unwise. Also,
there seems a chance that Dibbs and Majah
Neied don’t represent all the concentrated
intelligence of the earth. At all events, the
bulk of the world’s precedents and the
world’s experience are against the little
howling Cornstalk cult of anti-Bill—what-
ever that experience may be worth.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Westralia and Federation.
Premier Forrest is the only member of the
Westralian Ministry who has expressed him-
self in favor of Federation. The others, headed
by Throssell, Minister for Lands, are likely
to follow the W.A. motto of “ wait a while.”
Westralia clings to its traditions. The typical
groper—the embryo farmer—is held up by the
anti-Federalists in the guise of a sacrifice at the
altar of Federation, and as the greater portion
of the Customs duties is said to be derived
from interprovincial imports, the consequences
of the interprovincial freetrade are made the
most of. But the truth is that though
Westralia, geographically, represents about a
third of the continent, it is very small in other
respects. Individual interests are supreme.
Federation won’t suit the meat-ring for in-
stance, nor the Bunbury potato-growers, whilst
the members of the Ministry themselves would
become very small fry indeed in the Common-
wealth. The majority of the people are sound
on the question of Federation, and on the
benefit of Commonwealth union against the
small thing represented by the local article.
But the majority has not an adequate
voice in the matter. Parliamentary repre-
sentation does not always represent people,
but territory. Alec. Forrest, for instance,
represents 25 electors somewhere in the Nor’-
VVest, and a goldfields member may be sent in
by 2000 electors—but both members have equal
voting-power. Perth represents the Adminis-
tration, and the policy has been to make all
roads lead to Perth, regardless of distance.
But surely the vast seaboard of the West will
stand more than one port, and the Common-
wealth would soon find out if it could. Pro-
bably one of the effects of Federation would be
the opening of the splendid port of Esperance,
and the construction of a railway thence
through Norseman to Coolgardie goldfields, the
distance being only 250 miles, and a saving
from the East at the present time of 500 miles
by the ocean round the Leeuwin to Fremantle,
and of 150 miles by rail from Perth. The bare
suggestion of such a prospect is enough to
freeze Federation within the circle of vested
interests predominating in Parliament. Out-
side the gold-yield, and that goes out of W.A.,
the province has nothing to pool. The sacrifice
of the interprovincial duties, and the interests
of the pork and potato growers, were ostensibly
the lions in the path. Among a few people—a
mere handful—holding a vast territory, the in-
dividual is stronger than the common interest.
The rest of united Australia will not lose much
by the possible action of Westralia, but if that
province should lose the coming opportunity of
joining the union it will not be long in re-
gretting it.
♦
Pishing for Flatheads.
The N.S. W. political Labor League, which
makes a partly-recognised claim to state the
official N.S. W. Laborite policy, held its annual
conference the other day. The party in Par-
liament has for long had a large capacity for
snapping at other parts of itself, but, lately,
Federal issues have disorganised it worse than
ever ; so that the party’s whip made a reckless
dash away from the difficulties which he saw
ahead, and proposed that the conference should
declare the official Labor attitude with regard
to the Commonwealth Bill. Just then the un-
representative character of the conference
dawned on some of the members ; so, to escape
a fiasco, a large part of it suddenly developed
a strong desire to catch an early
train. Ihe official attitude therefore went
undetermined. But now a characteristically
anti-Billious thing has happened. Twelve
months ago the P.L.L. did declare a policy—
one of straight-out opposition to the Bill, which
it wanted to get amended. Laborites therefore
formed part of the triumphant minority on
Referendum-day. After that, the party sup-
ported Reid for all it was worth—became, for
electioneering purposes, a joint in his party’s
tail. For Reid was the chap to get the
amendments. Again and again it saved him in
the House ; he was still the chap to get a
proper Bill. Afterwards, the party entrusted
him with the mission to the Premiers’ Confer-
ence; he was still the chap for them. He
went to the Conference and got what he
could—got the three-fifths majority clause
knocked out and the provision for a,mending the
Constitution liberalised—and those were the
two things that had troubled them most. Yet
now some of their number and several of their
“ official ” papers have the anti-billious gall to
say that, inasmuch as the official Labor attitude
to the original Bill was one of opposition, and
inasmuch as that motion has not been wiped
off, the official attitude is still one of opposi-
tion, and the loyal Labor-men must vote No.
When some kind person asks the anti-Billious
party to come in out of the wet, he doesn’t in-
vite them to stay at his house altogether; he
expects them to shift when it stops raining.
And when some other kind person tells them
to go straight on till they get to a corner,
even G. Pile’s dog knows that they aren’t
expected to go past the corner. If it isn’t
inferred that they are to turn round the corner,
it at least is inferred that they shall seek fresh
directions there. The members of the Labor-
party wanted the Bill amended ; they voted
against it in order to get it amended ; they
chose a chap to do the job ; and he did it as
well as he could. Now they not only want to
repudiate the result, but they want to proceed
as if there had been no general election, no
Parliamentary .votes of confidence in Reid
(carried with their help, too), and no confer-
ence. There might be some sense in arguing
that the official Labor attitude is in support of
the amended Bill, inasmuch as tliev hung up
the old Bill till it was amended and then
appointed a man to amend it; but to say, in
those circumstances, that the official attitude
is still opposition is such a stupid perversion
that those who use that bait must have a poor
opinion of the sense of the fish they hope to
hook with it.
The Bill for the Bush.
“ Bungara ” to The Bulletin :
Why waste shot upon the Shellback paper ! In its own
blundering' fashion it is converting all its readers who are
anti-Billites, and strengthening the resolution of tired
Federalists to vote once again for the Bill. Last year
present writer took a two days’ ride to record his vote,
and spent the day on sentry-go before the court-house to
intercept all the hayseeds who “couldn’t read print with-
out their specs., which they had left at home” (same old
lie of the illiterate). The agony of explaining over and
over again that Snooker, the local member, was not on in
this Act, and that writer was neither asking them to
vote “ for him or agin ’im,” is still a sore memory, re-
lieved by the mental picture of Bill going into the ballot-
box with a copy of the “ brand he was to put a blanky
bar through.” Filled with enthusiasm and bush whisky,
present writer returned home with a large head and a
small, hoarse voice, and, when he saw the result of the
poll a week later, he resolved to let the referendum slide.
But the Shellback paper, and those who howl with it, have
altered that resolution, for what man on the land
can read its shameless appeal to the pockets of the
Riverina pastoralists and not take the trouble to vote for
the Bill, even though he walked 40 miles to do it! By
pointing out that the border pastoralists will lose by the
abolition of the accursed differential railway-rates, the
Shellback paper touches the great bod} - of producers on a
raw place by reminding them that they are already pay-
ing the “ £4 or £5 per ton ’’ to make up the heavy losses
the railway commissioners incur by their insane competi-
tion with the other provinces. I, with hundreds of others,
must pay £4 per ton to have ray wool carried 300 miles so
that the Commissioners may drag the Riverina wool 500
miles for 40s. Why ? Simply that a Sydney broker may
handle it instead of a Melb. broker. Thej 7 have us under
the whip, and squeeze us both ways. Fancy paying ±lO
freight on £2O worth of goods for 300 miles, yet the rail-
way will drag them 200 miles further towards the border
for less money, so that we may neither buy nor sell any-
where but in your accursed octopus of a city, Sydney.
Why, Northern storekeepers have their goods sent 200
miles past their stations and brought back again, because
by so doing they land them cheaper than by having them
consigned direct! We all pay our share of a State-owned
railway, yet the greater portion of the shareholders have
to submit to be robbed in the interest of pot-bellied city
parasites. And this is the system the Sunday Shellback
wishes to perpetuate. Mouthing patriotic sentiments, it
howls “ Who’s for good old N.S. W. ?” and at the same
time insults the patriotism of the border people by im-
ploring them to vote against Federation—not, mark you,
as men who may honesty think that the Federal Bill is
not calculated to advance the prosperity of N.S.W., hut
as wretched beings who should sacrifice all patriotic sen-
timents on the altar of self-interest, by voting for the
maintenance of a system which they admit is an in-
famous injustice to every producer, large or small, who
is not subsidised by differential freights. The same
paper’s efforts to influence the country vote would be
laughable if its arguments were not so irritatingly ab-
surd ; and its terrible forecasts of selectors’ and farmers’
troubles “ under the Blot tariff ’’ are insulting to the
average pastoralists’ intelligence. Why, even the much-
libelled “Bill the bushman ” remarked, when I read
what would happen to him if he voted for the other Bill,
“ Well, we know we’re mugs, ’cos if we wasn’t we’d live
in Sydney ; but we are not blanky, blank flaming mugs.”
To which the present writer fervently adds : “ No, not all
the time we ain’t.” And if Sydney fell into its beautiful
harbor some morning, the producers could easily find
another seaport where men do congregate to live by sell-
ing things to each other on commission. Not being
proud, any sort of a capital would suit us.
Closed Roads.
Attention has frequently been drawn to the
new grip got by the Yic. squatter on the un-
used roads of his province by means of the
carelessly-drafted provisions of the Vermin
Destruction Act. That the danger was no
imaginary one is now shown by a judicial
decision. Judge Hood, in retusing an applica-
tion for a mandamus to compel the East Lod-
don shire council to open certain roads in the
Serpentine Estate, obstructed by vermin-proof
(i.e., selector-proof) fences, said :
These fences were erected by the lessees of the Ser-
pentine Estate, purporting to act under the Vermin Des-
truction Act. By section of 58 of that Act the owner of
land intersected by roads might, with the sanction of the
shire council, enclose any of these roads under certain
specified conditions. This section limited the operation
of Section 428 of the Local Government Act, and enabled
shire councils to allow roads to be closed, with fences and
gates, in order to prevent the spread of vermin.
The italicised words are dangerous ones. Sec-
tion 428 of the Local Government Act above
alluded to really enshrines a great popular
victory. It represents the results of a genera-
tion of agrarian agitations against the squatters.
It renders reasonably safe the inalienable
popular right to the used and unused roads of
the province. Briefly, its effect is that councils
are hound to keep open all roads required for
traffic : that all roads are presumed to he re-
quired for traffic unless the Cabinet decides
otherwise ; hut that where no inconvenience is
caused, temporary swing-gates may be erected
with the permission of the local council and the
Cabinet. The Cabinet may at any time revoke
the permit. But, by an extraordinary, over-
sight, a proviso was allowed to creep into the
Vermin Destruction Act, which enabled the
shire council alone, without consulting the
Cabinet, to permit wholesale fencing across


closed roads in all vermin districts. No merely
temporary swing-gates, but practically per-
manent ones are allowed. Under the old
system a Ministry could be questioned, and, if
necessary, turned out if it allowed undue inter-
ference with roads. Under the new system
the Minister can do nothing whatever, the
whole power in the matter being given to coun-
cils, perhaps composed wholly of squatters —
probably dominated by squatters and their
friends and tradespeople. And the squatters
are annexing the bye-ways of Victoria whole-
sale under this proviso, and peacefully adding
them to their properties, and paying neither
purchase money nor rent for them.

Dangerously “Just Debts.”
Melb. Herald, commenting on the case of a
man who had met with what turned out to be
a fatal accident, and who cried out during his
suffering, “ For God’s sake write my will, as I
don’t want my wife to have any trouble after
I’m gone,” moralises excellently on the duty of
will-making. But, most unfortunately, it pro-
ceeds to tell people how' to do it by giving a
form of will which, if used, as it probably will
he by hundreds, may result in greater loss to
the wives and children of the testators than if
no will had been made at all. For the Herald
will-form contains, as do most forms sold by
stationers, the words, “after payment of all
my just debts,” &c. These words are unneces-
sary, for, whether used or not, the debts must
be first paid; so that the conscientious testator
needn’t alarm himself on that score if he leaves
the words out. But they are not merely un-
necessary, they are dangerous, for the Courts
have put a meaning into them which no tes-
tator in his senses ever would intend without
further minute specification. In most up-to-
date communities there is a law which makes
insurance-moneys up to a certain amount free
from the debts of the testator or intestate.
But the Courts have decided that the words,
“after payment of all my just debts,” in a will
amount to a voluntary foregoing of the benefits
of the law exempting insurance-moneys, and
that they charge the debts on such moneys as
well as the rest of the property of the deceased.
So that, in all provinces where provisions have
not been made correcting the judicial decisions,
those about to make a will are strongly advised
either to leave out the “just debts ” dangerous
surplusage, or not to make a will at all.

A vigilant Port Melbourne constable the other
day hunted round to find a case. Observing a
man, wno, six-and-a-half years ago, had been
convicted of “receiving,” but had since, so far
as is known, been living honestly, entering the
hotel, the zealous “ cop.” forthwith laid infor-
mation under the Licensing Act against the
landlord for “ harboring a convicted thief.”
At the local court, although the individual in
question was proved to have been years
ago !) a receiver, and not, technically, a thief—
and though there was not the slightest proof
adduced that he had since acted dishonestly—
the usual absurd J.P. fined the publican 40s.
without costs. The finee, who imputed to the
constable the harboring of a personal grudge,
has appealed, and the ridiculous decision will
no doubt be upset with contempt ; but there
is no appeal possible against the outrageous in-
justice done to the man who, long years ago,
committed his first and only offence. This per-
nicious persecution of erst criminals is not only
shameful and cruel, but exceedingly unprofit-
able to the community which pays policemen.
If a man is earning his living honestly, or,
at least, legally, it is simply utter foolishness to
badger him back into crime and make a felon of
him, w Inch is what th is disgraceful action amounts
to. And if the Crown Law authorities and the
heads of police approve of this sort of thing, it
is quite time they were forcibly persuaded that
the business of the ordinary “ trap ” is to pre-
vent crime, not to manufacture criminals with
a view to their subsequent capture and punish-
ment. Surely the police exist for the criminals,
and not the criminals for the police. Further-
more, if a man be a convicted thief, or receiver,
and have served a sentence therefor, it is none
the less libellous to publish the fact to the
world at large ; yet apparently the ordinary
constable, for his personal advantage or to
gratify his spite, is entitled to do so with im-
punity. Which is surely altogether too deadly
a weapon to be placed in the hands of the
policeman and his friends, the fizgigs and
bludgers.
In Melb., recently, two women were, upon the
same day, dealt with—one in the criminal court,
the other in Carlton police court—for irregular
disposal of the undesirable infant. In the
former case the accused, having been convicted
of concealment of birth, was reasonably and
mercifully committed to the care of the Salva-
tion Army instead of to gaol, whereas the other
poor creature (whose infant the defence alleged
to be the resultof drugging and outrage) received
from a Carlton tin-pot Draco the savage
sentence of 6 months hard labor for leaving her
infant, warmly wrapped and with an explana-
tory note, upon the door-step of a house in
which she supposed her sister-in-law was living.
And, even at that, the “ abandonment ” was
not complete, since the unhappy woman could
not bring herself to leave the neighborhood and
was consequently promptly arrested. And
then, though the Wesleyan mission people were
anxious to take charge of the woman, the un-
speakable Carlton magistrates, to the astonish-
ment and disgust of everybody in court,
flattened her out with three times as much gaol
as they’d have given to a hulking “ pushite ”
for nearly battering his old mother to death.
Does the Carlton bench ever get lynched ?
+
Holman, M.P., in his criticism of the amended
Constitution, was severe on the clause which
provides that members of the Senate are to be
elected by the province voting as one electorate
—surely one of the many Liberal provisions of
the Bill. His argument-in-chief was that on
the Referendum for the Convention delegates in
’9B the Labor-party was hopelessly beaten and
could not secure a representative amongst the
first 10. He did not mention that in Victoria
Labor-leader Trenwith was elected in a most
prominent position, and that, locally, Labor
would have assuredly had an excellent chance
of securing at least one seat but for the wooden-
headedness of the party’s grasping executive,
who coolly nominated 10 candidates and ex-
pected N.S.W. to elect the bunch ! Also,
Sturt and Wilcannia, the most unwieldy and
scattered electorates in N.S. W., return Labor-
members.
One of the recommendations of the Royal
Commission on N.S.W. Charities is, that in
future no institution of a semi-public nature
shall receive the Govt, subsidy unless its books
and management are open to inspection by a
Govt, official—probably a surprise to many
taxpayers, who would naturally suppose such a
stipulation a sine qua non. A case has lately
been unearthed where Govt, support (,£3O a
year) has been paid for an inmate in a Sydney
institution (whose object is to relieve temporary
distress) since her admission in 1863 ! The sum
voted to the establishment is claimed and paid
in a lump sum, names and dates not being
furnished. It is quite possible that this old
person has neither kith nor kin in N.S.W., and
no one to inquire whether she is alive or not in
what is practically a living grave. Indeed,
whether she is really alive is only known to
one or two persons, whose main, if not sole,
interest in her lies in the fact that her life is
worth £3O a year to the institution !
Summing up in the Dalkeith (W.A.) murder-
case, Chief-Justice Onslow made some per-
tinent remarks. The aboriginal, whose evidence
the prosecution depended upon, is a servant of
a neighbor of the murdered woman and the
(wrongfully) accused husband. For some 12
years he has been associating with whites, and
might be expected to see what he was wanted
to see. The Judge expressed himself thus :—-
He thought they might say of the natives that they
were naturally very observant in these matters, fiid
that the greatest possible credit must be given to ihe
acumen and sharpness of observation on the part of l lie
natives, and if they could be got to tell the result of their
observations without their seeing what was wanted, their
instincts were to tell the truth, but when subject races
were in the hands of the superior race, their instincts
were to tell what they thought the latter wanted. — West
Australian report.
The Judge did not say that there were the very
gravest reasons for barring the particular native
from taking part in the enquiry ; but that is
the popular opinion, and as a consequence the
faith of Westralians in their police adminis-
tration has sunk to a lower ebb than ever
“ A Wage-Slave ” to The Bulletin :
You talk of that bone-grinding monopoly, the Melb.
Tram Co. ; what about the Ocean-street (Sydney) cable-
tram service? Standard working time in this is 9 hours
10 min. per day, and, for conductors, the wages BJd. to
9d. per hour ; no overtime being paid until 120 hours per
fortnight have been worked. So that N.S.W. Govt, is not
only not above infringing upon the eight-hour principle,
but has also an extra roller in its mill for the purpose of
grinding out 10 hours per fortnight which it is too dis-
honest to pay for. It is fair enough that conductors’
cash shortages should be deducted from their pay, but no
account is kept of any overplus which a conductor may
hand in. A conductor may, if he wishes, book-up at end
of day his own cash and tickets, and thus set-off his own
surplusage and shortage; but, after 9 hours 10 min. on
the tram without any meal-interval, he is not likely to
care about a quarter-of-an-hour additional work. Be-
sides, if the department caught him pocketing its lawful
perks it might mean gaol. The day’s work of nine hours,
or so, is made up of journeys of 20 minutes ; two minutes
allowed for shunting at either end. As to lunch, rules
say, “ Eat it at rear of trail-car, and if a passenger gets
aboard—put down your food at once and collect his fare.”
If Nature calls—miss a trip, and get fined or sacked, or
do best you can out of the two-minute shunt, and run
fast to make up time—again at risk of fine or sack. No
sanitary convenience is provided for the employes any-
where but at Ocean-street terminus, while, as for the
fine-system, there isn’t any. An may be fined
for running fast, running slow, not running at all,
neglect, over-otfieionsness, not stopping, not starting
sharply: in fact, he does not know when, where and for
how much he may be liable. A conductor gets one day
off a week at the convenience of the department, and
thereby hangs a tale. The department sends the con-
ductors intended for the new electric service over to the
Mosman’s Bay line for training-. The electric department
sends to the cable department stating that on, say,
Wednesday it would be convenient to send a squad of men
for training, and the cable department reciprocates
by granting the squad Wednesday as its day off ;
result —a day’s work for nothing; a day’s riding about on
an electric tram for a change, or in the fitters’ shops
among wire, motors, and grease, and if a man fails to
turn up, explanation is demanded. Again, several men
have been injured at the steep termini by the bufferless
dummies, owing to want of sand on the rails in wet
weather. Reward —half-pay while on sick-list. Buffers
are necessary, anyhow, and would not interfere with the
working of the trams ; and even a Govt, should
not be expected to handle sudden death for a living,
especially as N.S.W. Factory Act compels private bone-
mills to provide safe working for their drudges. The
ticket system of fare-collecting-, again, does not protect
the department against dishonesty on the part of em-
ployes, because the hours and movements of the two
inspectors are well known ; and the tickets are no pro-
tection to the conductors, as a malicious passenger,
desirous of working off a grudge, may substitute an
expired for a current ticket, and have a whole carful of
passengers honestly willing to swear to his having paid
his fare. So that, on the whole, the methods of the local
bone-mill don’t appear to be much less ill-regulated and
tyrannical and dunderheaded than those of the Mel-
bourne one.

One reason for Tasmania’s belatedness in the
matter of Democracy is the press-gag law which
compels any would-be newspaper-proprietor to
find bonds amounting to £l6OO for his good
behavior. Thus it is sought to prevent those
persons who haven’t acquired property from
passing remarks as to how the old nobility of
the Flyspeck acquired their titles and estates.
The ancient law is practically a dead-letter in
most civilised communities, including even
Britain and Australia, but in Tasmania it is
enforced to the uttermost farthing. No more
eloquent witness to the soreness of the spot that
newspapers not established on a property-basis
might irritate could well be heard from than
Fatman’s rabid desire to "penalise a news-
paper-man before he commits any offence. The
man who beats his wife is bound over to keep
the peace, after he beats or threatens to beat
her ; a newspaper-man has to put up £l6OO as
a guarantee that he doesn’t intend to say dis-
respectful things about a dog. According to
the rulers of the Land of Baleful Shadows, a
wife-beater or a bludger is far less dangerous to
society than a newspaper person. After all,
The Bulletin isn’t quite sure that a man who
wants to start a paper in Tas. doesn’t deserve
to be treated as a criminal-lunatic. [And now
comes the news that, after the £l6OO security
has been remorselessly exacted for half-a-
century, it has just been discovered by the
Supreme Court that only £BOO was legally
exigible.]
The ghastly foolishness of an Anglican Church
mission to convert the local Jews made itself
heard in Melbourne lately, when “ missionary ”
L. Abramovitch was appealing for funds to
build a Kerristian night-school and a temporary
shelter for the needy Chosen. A recent article
in the Jewish Herald reads like an uninten-
tional satire on Abramovitch’s maunderings.
The Herald opposes a suggestion that the
Jewish Church should be closed against pro-
selytes who are prepared to marry into the old,
old Faith. Many an intelligent Jew will be
lost to the faith, says the Herald, if he can’t
get the conversion of his Gentile wife duly
recognised :
We yield to no man in our condemnation of mixed
marriages ; we deplore them as one of the greatest
offences against our faith and race ; but when such a
marriage has taken place, or cannot be prevented, let us
by all reasonable means try to retain the Jewish partner
and admit the non-Jewish one if she earnestly desires it.
. . . Instances are not wanting of persons who might
have become creditable Jews, but were turned away
through harsh treatment and unnecessary severity.
The time is surely coming when the Jews will
open a branch religion for the partial Hebrew-
isation of all Christians who can’t believe in the
divinity of the Nazarene. In the natural
course of enlightenment, the world becomes
more Jewish every day, physically and
morally. Its nose grows bigger, it is kinder to
its women, and it is adopting Israel’s
opinions on the subject of physical work. One
hears the impecunious loafer, with his back
against the pillar-box or verandah-post,
lamenting his bad luck in not having been born
a blanky Yiddisher. Well, they didn’t talk
like that at the times of the Crusades.
“ J.S.” on a sanitary matter :
At Redfern Station (Sydney) every morning in the
rabbit-season it is disgusting to see the bundles of rabbits
tossed out on the platform like offal, there to be pawed
and turned over by the hands or feet of the not too clean
and wholesome hawkers. And the usual hawkers’ carts !
The system under which they are hired makes no restric-
tion as to their use, so that when rabbits are “ in ” they
are used for rabbits ; another time for fruit; then for fish;
and perhaps even for bottles, old iron, rags, and garbage
in general. Hardly ever washed out, either, these carts ;
so that all sorts of germs are liable to be disseminated-by
them, especially as many of the rabbits come from
country where there is pleuro, anthrax, or tuberculosis.
Butchers’ carts also, which go to the abattoirs for entrails,
are afterwards sent round with the family steak without
any attempt at purification. Then in the grocer’s cart
are piled higgledy-piggledy kegs of butter, cases of eggs,
sacks of potatoes that have been dragged all over dirty
wharfs and stores, and your butter and general groceries
share the dust and rubbish resulting. The milkman and
the carcase-butcher are compelled to keep their premises
and conveyances clean, and the fish-market is well looked
after. Why should these other abominations not receive
the attention of the Health Board?
“Nicko” to The Bulletin on a subject which,
though of vital importance, could only be dis-
cussed in a medical paper :
The enthusiastic females who rush into print and howl
furiously over an allegedly-unfounded objection to lady
surgeons on the part of a section of the Melb. Women’s
Hospital Committee, appear to possess a profound ignor-
ance of their subject. The objection is a tacit one, of a
kind which no w’oman well put into words, but experi-
ence shows that it is—or should be—fatal. In all the
chief European hospitals, and in several Australian insti-
tutions, stringent rules are in force to obviate the risk of
septic trouble in surgical patients, arising from physio-
logical causes in the female staff of nurses. Listrr,
during his earlier experiments in antiseptics, was for long
at a loss to explain certain septic infections of wounds
which appeared at regular intervals among his patients.
By experiment and check-experiment he solved the pro-
blem, and a simple arrangement of relieving nurses,
at certain intervals and for certain periods, stopped
the mischief. In a midwifery hospital the risk,
for obvious reasons, is greater than in an ordinary surgical
ward, and the records of such institutions show the dan-
ger. In an Australian instance the regularity of the out-
breaks was too convincing to be disregarded, and the
lady-surgeon was hastily got rid of. The subject is
naturally a delicate one for consideration by a mixed
committee, but there is no doubt that, for the safety of
surgical or obstetric cases, a woman-surgeon should be
made to conform to the same rules as the nursing staff.
The risk of infection in her case is far greater, and until
this is done periodic septic outbreaks will oecur. Medical
men are strictly observant of this rule in their private
practice. Therefore, the objection of the committee is a
ver3' valid one, and, by the persistent howling of par-
tisans of the lady-medicos, a few more helpless mothers
are about to be made to run the risk of puerperal fever
as sacrifices to the fetish of the Advanced Woman. Hang
the A.W. ! Ask the next male-medico what he thinks—
after a w’hisky for preference.—P.

Raising the “age of consent” in Maoriland
has raised the work in the Courts. It was to
be expected. Repentance follows hard upon
the heels of passion. Give it a show, and it
exhibits a practical way of putting the guilt on
another’s shoulders. Up to 1894, “the age”
in Maoriland was 14. Then it was raised to
15. And recently—the white-chokered being
now high-up in the land—it has been raised to
16. Mr. Justice Dennistoun remarks from his
Supreme Court eminence, that—
The original law was intelligible. It protected the
ignorant girl. But girls of 16 were perfectly cognisant of
their action. Under the present law, a girl immediately
under the age of 16 might be the actual seducer of a lad,
say 17, and then might bring criminal proceedings
against him, and be able to extort money from him.
They had heard a great deal lately about the protection
of their girls, but it seemed to him that there was con-
siderable necessity for the protection of their boys. It
was an extraordinary thing that a girl could hale a lad
up for a crime of which she was the cause.
Which is good, wholesome talk, and sensible,
and appeals to knowledge and experience. It
is certain, anyway, that before the world is
much older, man’s virtue will be considered as
precious an article as woman’s. And so it is—
since rarity enhances value.
The perennial outcry, “ Australians a dying
race,” has made its reappearance. It is a
charge remarkable for absurdity, as, to begin
with, it presupposes that there is an “ Austra-.
lian race ” old enough for comparison to be
made between a few generations. This is
not the case at all. It is only a small stock of
a particular origin that is so old. The great
mass of the native Australian population is of a
later superimposed stock, of very different for-
mation, diluted with the progeny of undis-
tinctive subsequent arrivals, and, even exclud-
ing the latter element, is still principally in the
first generation. Some fluctuations of type are
sure to follow the settlement of a new country,
and to exhibit both improvement and deterior-
ation for two or three generations, in the pro-
cess of adaptation. There is also bound to be
some relative deterioration following the tran-
sition from a “ new’ ” to a “ settled ” country,
on account of the increase of sedentary and
unhealthy occupations, and the greater cramp-
ing of individual life by social environment.
Taking which things into account, the amounts
of deterioration and otherwise at all computable
from the very short data as yet available go to
show, if they show anything, that a remark-
ably vital race is in course of evolution in Aus-
tralia. But no doubt the first remark made by
ie original descendant of the missing link was
to the effect—“ The race is played out.”

scancl off 101 l 2 p.m. and perhaps make his day up by 9
0 clock at night. Having been employed once is no
guarantee of being employed again; the work is casual
in the fullest sense of the word. A day’s work is 9 hours ;
no extra payment for overtime. Hourly rate is
od., or 6s. for 9 hours; truly a sweaters’ rate,
when a contractor in same yard can afford to pay 7s.
In tact, the whole Darling Harbor staff, mechanical and
clerical, is cruelly' sweated. Freight clerks work 10, 12,
anil 14 hours with no overtime payment. There is a
departmental fiction that overtime a cumulates and may
be taken out in holidays, but many men in Darling Har-
bor yard have arrears of overtime or holidays extending
over two or three years. The business at the Harbor has
gone on increasing year by year without a corresponding
increase in staff or of pay for extra labor and longer
hours. Rushers are common, and no man dares to open
his mouth. Since the abortion of the Schey inquiry, the
Railway Service has escaped criticism and is now full of
abuses which should be worth the attention of Labor
members. The Government, before harrying tinpot shop-
keepers whose businesses rate as “ factories,” should set
about removing the scandals from its own service.

“ A. L. W.” to The Bulletin about leprosy :
As we are so strict about the isolation of leprosy, a
doubtfully communicable disease, why are consumptives
allowed to move about at will exuding microbes at every
breath, and scattering deadly sputum as they go? As
for leprosy, I have lived for years amongst leprous per-
sons in Fiji, where lepers marry clean-skins, have pro-
geny, live and die unheeded by Govt, or by anybody else.
Neither is any fuss made about the so-called dreadful
disease in any of the other Pacific islands. As a trader
in the Fijis I handled trade and goods generally with
lepers, and I do not know of any white in Fiji becoming
infected in this way. Grossing Vanua Levu once had
occasion to stop at an inland village for two days. My
host and hostess were clean and healthy looking—certainly
no external sign of leprosy, yet their 16-year son,
the sole leper in the village (having been infected for
three years), was literally rotten with it. This boy passed
me food frequently with his unaffected hand, and, for all
I knew, I slept on a mat he may have used. Also
I dressed his affected parts. Also, a sleeping-
mat used by a leper would be readily slept upon
b .V a hale Fijian. Yet the disease is not spreading in the
Fijis. Sometimes it appears in the denizen of an island
whereon not the oldest inhabitant can remember a pre-
vious case—the p dient also never having left his home or
encountered a leper.
Even here, when a case of leprosy is discovered,
it has generally been treated for months as some other
disease before its true nature dawns upon the doctor,
so that if it (leprosy’) were contagious, it would have been
all this time scattering itself broadcast. Also, there are
people in Australia who have for years secretly housed a
family-leper. “ Blood-poisoning, you know ! So very
sad ! ” So the secret is kept between the family and the
doctor until, by some accident, it is discovered, when
doctor feigns previous ignorance, and another family is
shamed and outraged.

The most beautiful thing this paper has met
with for a long time is the demand of the
Newcastle-Wallsend Sun that Newcastle
shall have a great International Exhibition :
Some months ago we advocated the necessity of a New-
castle Exhibition for the year 1900—a fitting close of the
old century and a brilliant opening of the new—to be de-
frayed by Government. At that time we pointed out
only an exhibition on a grand scale can advertise the
great national wealth of the Newcastle District and the
grand opening there exists for sound investment by
capitalists of the world. Our idea is a World’s Fair —
something likely to establish great industrial works on
the reaches of the Hunter, something to make Newcastle
what it should be—the great industrial seat of the
Southern Hemisphere. And, we repeat, until a plan of
this kind is carried out, Newcastle will always remain in
the background. A local show will only have a local
effect : almost every small town in N.S.W. has its little
show. We should look to something higher and nobler
than a country show if we desire the world to take notice
of Newcastle.
Australia chatters even in its sleep about the
“ boundless resources of this great country,”
but the above is a more than usually beautiful
sample of the disease. Newcastle district is
ap ordinary sort of place which produces coal
and vegetables, like many thousand other
places in this world. The coal is black and
the vegetables are green, like other coal and
vegetables. Nobody outside Australia wants
to buy the vegetables, and there are none to
sell, because N.fS. W. has never grown enough
to supply itself. The outside world buys the
coal because it is combustible, and doesn’t much
care where it comes from. It doesn’t “ take
notice” of Newcastle. It is so like poor old
Parkes’s query put to a visiting German :
“I)o they talk much about us in Berlin?”
Parkes was a riotous young man of about
65 then, and lie was also worried because the
world didn’t “take notice.”
Evidently Victoria is to endure a lot of
twaddling details re Taverner in Hingland.
The rotund Minister of Agriculture had no
sooner reached his field of missionary labor than
the cable reported—“On his way to England
Mr. Taverner stayed for a while in Rome. He
had a satisfactory interview with the Italian
Minister for Agriculture, and obtained valuable
information on the treatment of phylloxera, on
sericulture, technical education, and the packing
and grading of lemons for export.” Are the
public deluded by these hollow political tricks ?
Taverner didn’t need to go to Rome for any
hints that he may have gathered from another
Taverner in Italy. It was all obtainable from
books and pamphlets which the Italian consul
in Melbourne can procure by post. The cabled
suggestion that two official heads of agricultural
departments have to put themselves together
in order to pass along “ information ” from one
to t’other, and that farmers, orchardists, and
wine-growers depend upon theTAVERNERSof this
world for wisdom, is calculated to make any
intelligent reader tired.
The Bookfellow this month takes another
leap in size; and the contents are more varied
than previously. There are articles on the French
poet, Baudelaire, and the Australian one, Mary
Footfc, with portraits; a notice cf artist Tom
Roberts, with portrait and reproductions of his
work ; the Quatrain forms the subject of numerous
quotations ; the Brownings’ love-letters and E. J.
Brady’s book of verses are reviewed at some
length; Victor Daley contributes a satire in
verse ; and there are numerous illustrations and
portraits. Prizes are offered for French transla-
tion and an English quatrain ; and altogether the
number is well worth its modest price of 3d., post
free from Bulletin office.

Somebody has said somewhere, “There is
more material for a life of Falstaff than for a life
of Shakespeare, though for both there is a lament-
able dearth.” Shakespeare is accountable, per-
haps, for much of this —and the critics for much
more. The Falstaff of the Henry V. cycle is not
the Elizabethan Falstaff written (if rumor be
correct) to please the whimsy of a queen. The
fat, greasy swashbuckler of the elder story is far
different from the almost Quixotish knight—who
is not nearly so degraded as some of his down-
takers—of the piece written to please Elizabeth
Tudor. The play was produced at Her Majesty’s
in Nov. ’9O. Then, the Falstaff was William
Rignold—a great, genial, convincing Falstaff,
whose impersonation carried so great a measure of
conviction that one imagined he was witnessing
Shakespeare’s big, gross, jovial, sunny humorist
himself, as every lover of a most loveable
character could conceive him perhaps, not
one whit less loveable, in the whole circle
of literature, than Don Quixote himself,
and that is saying much. The performance
of brother George is round, rich, and unctuous.
But it is not the common act of nature, so much
as a great intellectual effort. One reads brain in
every line of the last Falstaff’s work, and it is
work pleasingly intellectual.
* * * *
In the old performance, Mr. G. Rignold
played a very capable and satisfactory Ford. This
part is now sustained by Mr. H. W. Diver.
Curiously enough, it is the comedy side of what is
mentally tragic in Iago; but Mr. Diver is in-
finitely more satisfactory as Ford than as
the cunning Ancient of the jealous Moor.
A very capable performance was that of Mr. John-
son Weir (Sir Hugh Evans)—played with broad
humor, but also with shaded delicacy : a part which
might, in less artistic hands, become gross. But,
place aux dames ! Emphatically the Mistress Page
of experienced Watts-Phillips and the Mistress
Ford of Miss Lilian Wheeler gave a nuance of re-
fined distinction to the whole performance. Mr.
Nunn worked hard as Doctor Caius, but his broken
English was the broken English of a Frenchman
whose Gallic confines were those of Stratford-
atte-Bowe. Miss Roxy. Barton was not the Dame
Quickly of our imagining. Mr. S. Grainger’s
Page was eminently respectable—and nothing
more. It’s a long cast, and space is limited ; and
the run we anticipate for this last edition of Fal-
staff will furnish opportunities enough and to spare
for mention of some folk now unavoidably left out.
A feature of the present production is the splendid
scenery painted by Mr. Phil Goatcher and Mr.
Whaite. In stage scenery it is difficult to imagine
anything possibly finer than the splendid scenic
vista of Windsor Park.

The farewell performance to M. Ldon
Caron prior to his departure for Europe took place
at Her Majesty’s Theatre last week. A long pro-
gramme was submitted. The Royal Comic Opera
company appeared in the first act of “lolanthe,”
the second act of the Napoleonic play, “Madame
Sans-Gfine,” was played by the Brough Comedy
company, and M. Caron conducted a concert ala
Julien, comprising the combination of 75 pro-
fessional instrumentalists. Miss Dorothy Yane,
Miss Rose Musgrove, and Mr. George Lauri
contributed musical items ; and the Tivoli was
represented by Mr. Harry Rickards and Mr.
Emanuel Woodson, the contortionist ; and Mr.
Charles Kenningham introduced Mahomet, the
talking horse, from Fitzgerald’s Circus.

“ Pygmalion and Galatea ” introduced
Julius Knight and Ada Ferrar again to Sydney.
The statuesque proceedings opened to a matinee
house on Saturday afternoon. The mingling of
burlesque and pretty pathos that characterises
this lightly-elad play makes it a touchy little piece
to interpret satisfactorily. Half the Knight-Ferrar
coalition leaned its weight on the pathos. The other
half preferred to support itself on the burlesque.
This scribe was visited by the mixed emotions that
come to the man who finishes up The Geisha with
the Lord’s Prayer. Ada Dewar’s Galatea was a
sweetly silly creature whose appalling beauty was
the only excuse she could offer for her silly
sweetness. She played delicately and carefully,
with the old, old weepy modulations trailing up
and down her voice at accurately timed in-
tervals, and made the artistic success of the
piece. Julius Knight, as Pygmalion, was merely
a gentleman in a chiton of his own design
who humped himself on every possible and
impossible occasion. Oily Deering looked rather
astray in the Greek atmosphere. For all that,
Oily is a droll comedian ; there was a note of
modern vulgarity about his Chrysos which was
probably realistic, but which cast slurs on “the
Glory that was Greece,” and all that sort of
thing. The slur was further emphasized by one
of the largest, most Hibernian-looking ladies ever
seen on the stage, who answered to the name of
Daphne instead of Biddy. Cyril Keightley,
as Leucippe, was just one degree ahead
of other performances of his. Miss Linda
Raymond played Myrine with an agreeably
distinct voice, and a nice, bright little way of her
own; but Emily Hughes, as Pygmalion’s wife,
seemed to be overcome with her efforts to settle
into somebody else’s voice. Only an extra-stagey
speech, such as her purple renunciation of Pyg-
malion, "brought her into touch with her stagey
conception of the part.
• * * *
On Monday, at Her Majesty’s, Mr. Julius
Knight and Miss Ada Ferrar, assisted by talent
vigorous and varied, continued the kindly function
of “ farewelling ” that section of the British race
resident in Australia with a performance, rich
in costume and radiant as to scenery, of
“ The Prisoner of Zenda.” Everything connected
with Anthony Hope’s romantic play is known
to everybody ; but it was none the less enjoyable.
On Wednesday the awful plagiarism perpetrated
by Wilson Barrett on Massinger’s “Virgin
Martyr,” to wit “The Sign of the Cross,” was
successfully achieved ; and to-night, Thursday
(May 4th), the “farewell performance in Sydney ”
of “The Lady of Lyons, which we are kindly in-
formed is “Lord Lytton’s evergreen play,” takes
place.
* * * *
Carton’s admirable comedy of “ Lord and
Lady Algy ” comes to a regrettable end to-morrow
(Friday night). Saturday (May 6) sees the first
performance in Australia of “The Adventure of
of Lady Ursula,” by Anthony Hope, whose
“ Prisoner of Zenda ” has only just been revived
at Her Majesty’s by the Julius Knight-Ada
Ferrar combination. “Lord and Lady” have
been doing something more than good business.
Which is only what it deserves. There are too
few plays of this true comedy type produced in
Sydney.
* * # *
Peggy Pryde was accorded a right royal
welcome on her re-appearance at the Tivoli. Mr.
J. Bain, an Australian comique, also received dis-
tinguished attention ; and the others were
as entertaining as heretofore. The Keziahs,
Manuel Woodson, “Charlie” Cogill, Wallace
King, et hoc genus omne, as the poet Sayers would
remark, were all wool and a yard or so wide.
* * * *
The Opera House re-opened, after a fort-
night’s silence, with an alleged musioal comedy
called “The Two Scamps.” “The Scamps” were
named respectively Bert and Bob, who were
monotonously troubling or in trouble. A number
of the songs had somewhat of merit, and some of
them were kindlier unspoken of. Miss Minna
Phillips and Mr. T. Edmond Leonard were the
scampy ones. The parody of “Off to Phil-
adelphia ” was excellently rendered by Mr.
Leonard, who brought down the house with his
references to the military poet of Paddington,
Premier Reid, and other prominent warriors, civic
and otherwise. Mr. Fred. Wentworth deserves
mention for his rendering of “The Deathless
Army. ” Mr. J. E. Shepherd, Miss Hilda Fraser,
and Miss Miriam Lewis also did excellent work.
The production was, moreover, adequately staged,
ifc * * *
To gild refined gold, to paint the lily, to
throw a perfume on the violet, to smoothe the ice,
or add another hue unto the rainbow, or with
taper-light to seek the beauteous eye of heaven to
garnish, is wasteful and ridiculous excess ; but the
Anderson - Holloway combination in “Man’s
Enemy ” has essayed this with more than mode-
rate measure of success. The play is not appal-
lingly brilliant from a literary point of view; but
for sumptuousness of scenery and radiance of
limelight it leaves nothing for the most expansive
imagination to claw upon.

It is well-nigh impossible to say anything
fresh about Fitzgeralds’ Circus. Beaconsfield, in
a happy moment, remarked that Eclipse was first
and the rest too bad a second to make a note of.
Sufficient for the day is the Circus thereof—but
only when the Fitz. Brothers are doing it. If it
were possible to say anything new about the lion
and the elephant and the bicycle, it should be
done —and the “ bunyip ” should also not be for-
gotten. And let it be enthusiastically recorded
that Cicero once remarked, “I may contrive to do
without the necessaries of life; but give me my
circuses. ”
£|£
“The Belle of New York” will have
ceased to be at the Princess’s when these remarks
appear, but “in response to numerous requests ”
The Bulletin herewith expresses Melbourne’s
gratitude to a certain youthful member of the
male chorus who impersonated a warbling cook in
the first scene. The young man under notice was
the cook who stood nearest the footlights on
the o.p. side, and patiently bore the endearments
of two nice parlor-maids. The impassiveness of
that young songster amounted to the best
joke in the show. He gazed out into the
distance whilst the dear charmers wooed him
for all they were worth. They put their respective
heads upon his shoulders, but he observed them
not. The more their bright eyes glanced the
less he troubled to beware. Finally the words
and music gave him the cue to place a couple of
hard, unsympathetic arms behind a couple of
slender waists, whereupon the damsels took joint
action to compel their inflexible “ mash ” to sway
gently with the movement of their bodies. It was
hard work for them, and the writer hopes they
were paid something extra.

The farewell season of the Knight-Ferrar
co. opens on Saturday in Melb., and will extend
over 13 performances and five dramas. Time-table
as follows: “Pygmalion and Galatea,” for three
nights; “Lady of Lyons,” day and night on
Wednesday; “Harbor Lights,” three nights;
“Royal Divorce,” two nights ; and three turns of
“ Sign of the Cross,” to play Marcus and Mercia
off the premises.
* *
Meanwhile “ Woman and Wine ” continue
to demoralise Walter Baker at the Royal, and the
stiffened jockey falls off his educated horse with-
out fail. The naughty, but otherwise irrational,
melodrama is running till further notice with all
its original scenery and effects, except that the
French tenor has set himself to a new tune.
** * *
Every now and then manager Rickards in-
troduces a very big novelty with a medium-sized
advt., leaving the excellence of the show to make
itself famous. Cinquevalli, who came to Melb.
Bijou last Saturday as “the most finished per-
former in the English-speaking world,” is—for all
that one can reasonably suppose to the contrary —
the cleverest juggler of any time or place. If
there was ever another man who could do things
as astonishing as the things this man does, m
the same casual manner, The Bulletin would
like to know where the other fellow was,
and why his name doesn’t live in history.
Cinquevalli’s feats range from the marvellous
to the miraculous; moreover, he is a juggler of
infinite jest. He turns the audience’s gasps into
guffaws with a humorous movement of the head,
arm, or body, and he gives them no time to con-
sider that his performance must be seen more than
once to be fully understood. Sometimes it is
appalling, but in a general way it is a neat and airy
sequence, of surprises. Perhaps the quaintest, if
not the most extraordinary of the Cinquevallian
proceedings is the “ eye-glass ” joke. The juggler
puts on his foot a metal disc, which might
be half-a-crown. He jerks his foot and the half-
crown flies to the place where an eye-glass is
carried, and sticks there as though to the manner
born. He jerks his head and the disc is lodged in
front of the other eye. If Cinquevalli had a glass-
eye he could pick it from the floor with his toes
and shoot it into the vacant socket every time.
That’s the sort of juggler he is. Having seen
Cinquevalli you feel almost prepared to die, for
there is no more jugglery left to live for.

The pedantic assertion that Friedenthal i s
not a ‘ ‘ great ” pianist, in a loud way of speaking)
seems very characteristic of the musical-critic cult.
“The soundness of his method” is sometimes
open to question, writes a Melbourne authority ;
but he “is beyond all dispute thoroughly com-
petent to give an audience keen enjoyment by his
own unassisted efforts.” What are the methods
essential to “greatness ”? Friedenthal appeals to
the ear. He makes the least possible display of
manual labor in the matter, and the skill and
intelligence of his playing rely solely upon musical
effects for public appreciation. Therefore the
public reckon Friedenthal an exceptionally sound
performer.

Dante’s magic-supper, and the cremation
of the adorable lady (whose skull was described
as “ skill ”in last issue), and the manufacture of
mystic billiard-balls, &c., are happening seven
times a week at St. George’s Hall to the satisfac-
tion of large audiences. Present writer can’t
quite comprehend what the lady does to deserve
her doom, but seeing that she returns to life With a
brighter smile than ever, the burning incident is of
no consequence, except that it tends to explain
why she can subsequently “ scorch ” on a bicycle
upside-down.

Grattan Riggs is still holding out at the
Alexandra, unless something has dissuaded that
estimable comedian from further exertions, for the
present. Grattan on Saturday made a slow and
difficult appearance as Tracey the Detective, and,
although he warmed-up after a while, in response
to sacrilegious exhortations from the gallery,, his
efforts suggested footsteps on the sands of time
when the evening sun is low.

Melbourne’s annual music boom will get
fairly going on Saturday, when Allan and Co.
start a series of afternoon ballad concerts at the
Town Hall. The co. for the first concert includes
Mrs. Palmer, Miss Ida Osborne, basso Barker,
Armes Beaumont, Brownlow, and two long-lost
singers in James Wood and Miss Christie Fuller.
On the same evening Friedenthal —who is only a
great favorite, and not a “great” pianist, the
critics say —is to give a farewell concert in the
big hall; and on the next Saturday afternoon
Marshall - Hall’s orchestra will take the floor.
This is the season of the year when Melbourne
grows its hair long and talks of upper-registers.
At Poverty Point.
“ Buskin ” : Oh ! “ Why does he (Rignold) stab, after
smothering, Desdemona ? " Now let the locust-swarm
of correspondents who have seen all the tragedians from
Kean to Salvini arise and testify that G.R. is not an
innovator in this respect. And “ The text gives no war-
ranty” for the stabbing, eh? (vide Bulletin 22/4/’99).
No, the original folio does not specifically direct, “knifes
her here,” but, then, Shakespeare usually did leave some-
thing to the reasoning faculties of stage-managers in
futuro. As a guide-post, he gave Othello the lines (after
smothering her), “ Not yet quite dead. . . . I would not
have thee linger in thy pain . . . so, so.” No warranty?
Any amount of it. Desdemona speaks again, twice !
After being only smothered? And the text says, after
her second utterance, “Dies.” Does the merely
“ smothered,” after regaining enough breath to speak a
dozen or so words, die —of smotheration ? Will some
medico kindly step up and orate ? Trust me, Shakespeare
knew better than that. Tragedy demanded that Desde-
mona should die, and poetic conception required that she
should accuse herself of her murder in answer to Emilia’s
question. Therefore, when Will was stage-managing, a
little while before The Bulletin was started, the Othello
first smothered then stabbed. [Thus Othello, so firm, so
constant to the very last, that we cannot readily imagine
a deflection : “Yet I’ll not shed her blood.” Salvini
dragged his Desdemona all over the bedchamber. There
might here be an excess of art; hut in the “So, so!”
why not Fechter’s method, the quick strangular hand of
a strong man ? —Ed. B.]
“ B.” : The announcement about Rignold playing
Falstaff revives recollections of that veritable ideal “ ton
of sack,” his brother William. How will the local histrion
compare with his relative in the part ? Then Rignold
threatens to play D’Aitagnanin “The Three Musketeers.”
He seems impossible 1 The hero of old Dumas was long,
lean, gaunt, nervous, vitriolic, swift of speech—a true
Gascon. Scot Inglis could have played it. Rignold might
manage Porthos, but Brian Dariey would have fitted the
part to a nicety. For Aramis, say Dot Boucicault, petit,
refined, and chockful of s avoir faire. Athos would be
safe in the hands of Alfred Dampier. We haven’t a
woman in Australia capable of playing Miladi. How
would Olga Nethersole fill the part?
The Melb. Opera House question is unsettled again,
few weeks ago Rickards’ term for leasing a new tneacre
on the old site had been practically accepted, ana tne
work of rebuilding was under consideration when trial
shrewd tactician got a chance to buy the Tivoli theatre,
Sydney—a bargain. Then his Opera House otter was
“off.” At the present moment it is not at all ceitain
that a new playhouse will come to pass in Melbourne.
Press-circle seats for the Amy Castles concerts at Ben-
digo this week were auctioned, the result being i'l3o tor
179 seats. In the light of these fancy prices it seems an
extraordinary thing that no one should have discovered
the “ wonderful” quality of Miss Amy’s voice during the
last four years when she has competed for various scholar-
ships in Bendigo and Ballarat and lately in Melbourne.
The judges, themselves professors of music, who heard
her, merely remarked, “ A ver3 r good voice.”
Hosea Easton, so well known for his impersonation of
Uncle Tom, can appear on the stage no more. He is
stricken with cancer of the tongue, and has undergone two
terrible operations. Easton was not only a good actor,
but one of the finest banjoists Australia has ever heard.
The poor fellow’s case is emphatically one for a benefit.
Mrs. Watts-Phillips, wife of the famous dramatist and
novelist, died recently in London, aged 67. Miss Roland
Watts-Phillips, the Emilia in Rignold’s production of
“ Othello,” at Sydney Cri., is a daughter of the dramatist,
who, by the way, was the author of “ The Dead Heart,”
and of “As in a Looking-Glass,” the piece in which
Bernard-Beere scored so happily.
“ Blister” : Best bit of character-acting in “ The Belle
of New York” is the Tart in the Torn Jacket, who comes
on with the crowd when the hallelujah lass enters. She
acts and walks the part all the time, and looks like a
“half-tanked” dollymop who has just pushed in from
Little Bourke-street to see what’s up.
Dear Bulletin.— Somebody refers to one of Pauli’s
stage-mannerisms as that of the “ typical Englishman.”
If Pauli is English, how did he come by his typically-Irish
face ?—E.
A Bulletin man was located next a stern female at
Dante’s Melbourne show one recent night. The stern
female had brought her small, mild hubby out foratreat,
and the little man was sitting next the gangway.
Presently the miracle-worker rushed along, and gathered
two half-crowns from behind his collar. “ You little fool,
you !” hissed his red, indignant missus, “haven’t I told
you scores of times to be more careful with your money ?"
Then Dante began plucking half-crowns out of other
men’s whiskers, and just saved himself from an attack
hotly meditated by the deluded lady.
An anachronism in “Our Guardian Angel,” which
flings it right back to the days of Defoe, is the serious
use of the phrase, “ A true-born Englishman.” But
didn’t Daniel effectually slaughter the value of that ex-
pression when he pointed out that a true-born English-
man was a mongrel of all the races on earth ?
“D.”: No wonder the Broughs felt sore over their
Melbourne season. Was sitting up amongst the gods at
a performance of the “Second Mrs. Tanqueray.” When
the pathos was most intense, some of the Indians on the
top-shelf yelled with amusement. One nautical-looking
idiot, each time that Paula contrasted her present life
with her past (and she strikes a truly pathetic note at
times), got up on his feet and laughed till the tears rolled
down his cheeks.
All the Ned Kelly relics, including a lot never before
shown, were brought forth in Melb. gaol warders’
exhibition at St. Vincent’s Bazaar. First, the real Ned
Kelly armor, complete, weighing over 901bs. Also,
the armor of Dan Kelly and Hart. This was found in
Glenrowan Hotel, and resembles Ned’s, except that the
nail-can helmets are padded inside, whereas his is not.
Byrne’s armor was not shown ; Supt. Hare gave it to
Lady Janet Clarke. A photo, of Ned Kelly’s fine spirited
horse was novel and interesting. Bushranger Morgan’s
hat was shown with a bullet-hole through it.
“Melb.”: The gaol warders’ show clinched my atten-
tion. Some catalogue : A perfect model, one-quarter
scale, of Melb. gallows, with working drop, and a dummy
figure to illustrate the scrag. Deeming’s two-edged knife
—the most murderous-looking, little, thin, worn wretch
ever made, and yet razor-sharp. It has got more murders
on its face than he had on his. This atrocious dagger
was shaped by some one, maybe in Italy, on purpose for
secret homicide. A tempting blood-red rose on a bush in
the Botanical may say “Steal 1” and this says “Kill!”
Then there is Deeming’s tiny, greasy-looking, black-
handled hatchet, a toy of a thing, very old to look at,
and you would say it was only meant for a five-year-old
boy to play with—but for its workmanlike blade, like a
reduction of the headsman’s. The cast of Deeming’s
outspread hands, lying on their faces, made one think
they might fly up to your throat. They recalled to me a
frightful tale by Gdrard de Nerval, where a dead man’s
hand was cut off and ran away like a tarantula.
Wanted —Want.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Immediately the date was fixed for the referendum, the
following cablegram was dispatched to London by N.S.W.
Colonists’ Anti-Convention Bill League to Mr. Want, the
ex-Attorney General: —
“To Want, c.o. Agent-General, London.—Referendum
in eight weeks. Can you take., part. Urgently desire
your assistance. Eagar. Reply paid.”
The reply was as follows :
“ London, 29/4/99. Eagar, Sydney.—Cannot arrive in
time protest or refuse (V refute) Bill. Resigned directly
saw Hansard. Bill getting worse. Justified my mistrust
other colonies. Means death-warrant Sydney. Give
publicity.”
“We want you, Jack ! Come back, come back !
We want you mighty badly ;
Our cause is queer, our prospects black —
We need a leader sadly.
Our friends, we fear, are very few ;
Our funds, alas ! are meagre ;
For hope forlorn we turn to you ;
Come quick ! We’re waiting—Eagar ! ”
“ I’ll come ! I’ll come—to burst the drum !
So let the. muskets rattle !
I’m with you, boys ! I’ll come, I’ll come—
After you've lost the battle.
The Bill, I’ll swear, is most unfair ;
Get in the funds, and spend ’em ;
Keep up your hearts ! For I’ll be there —
After the Referendum.
‘ ‘ I fear’d awhile, when on the Nile,
My bogeys all were answer’d ;
But pluck’d up courage (I should smile)
Directly I saw Hansard.
Bill has my curse. It’s getting worse—
I can’t explain exactly ;
But wolves are wolves, and Jack’s perverse—
And that’s my case compactly.
“Now, see how just was my mistrust
Of folk beyond the Murray ;
Concession only proves their lust
To loot us in a hurry.
Who could foresee that they’d agree
To all we ask’d- or nearly ;
Our best-laid plans they sent “agley ”
It shakes one’s faith severely.
“ Sydney’s death-warrant has been sign’d !
Might save her —if I hurried.
To start at once I’ve half a mind—
But why should / be worried ?
Sorry can’t come to funeral,
But please express my sorrow;
Bid comrades all go bear the pall,
And I’ll be back— to-morrow .”

The WILD CAT
COLUMN
The National Bank of Australasia publishes a
balance-sheet which certainly doesn’t look violently pro-
gressive. The profits for the half-year ended 31st March,
1899, are £12,324—a heavy drop as compared with the
previous half-year, and the worst showing since 1896.
Recent returns compare as follows :
March, 1894 .. £31,312 March, 1897 .. £14,712
September, 1894 .. 25,231 September, 1897 .. 18,275
March, 1895 .. 15,126 March, 1898 .. 15,471
September, 1895 .. 13,763 September, 1898 .. 17,602
March, 1896 .. 10,523 March, 1899 .. 12,324
September, 1896 .. 11,706
The usual 5 per cent, is paid to preference shareholders,
which absorbs £7645, and the remaining £4679, with pre-
vious balance, raises the amount at credit of profit and
loss to £52,117. But altogether the circumstances, unless
the National can show some special reasons for them, are
unaccountable. Also, they certainly look lament-
able. The net earnings are only equal to £1 4s. 4d.
per cent, per annum on the shareholders’ funds (capital
£1,976,880, and reserve, £50,000), which is so miserably
small as to strongly suggest that many of the assets are
yielding a very small return and that there is need for a
heavy writing down—or else that the National is reserv-
ing a large part of its earnings and applying them to
providing for losses and depreciations which the share-
holders have not heard of. At all events this very solemn
fact stares the shareholders in the face. The National
Bank holds £837,920 of Government, municipal and other
stocks. Butting them all down at a minimum interest of
3 per cent, (and no municipal and very few Government
stocks yield so little as that) the half-year’s interest
received would be £12,568. And as the bank professes to
earn only £12,324, the inference is that the hanking busi-
ness itself hasn’t been doing any too well. The National
has been steadily paying off its burdensome 4J4 per
cent, reconstructed deposits (only i 825,000 remain
out of the original £6,844,000). Each payment made a
great saving' in interest, but instead of this making the
profits larger they are smaller now than on any occasion
since the ’93 smash, the 1896 returns only excepted. If
the profits shown are all the National’s earnings, they
certainly seem to suggest the advisability of writing the
capital down largely. If they are not all the earnings
and the remainder is being applied to write down the
assets, it would be better to avoid misconception and keep
up the credit of the institution by stating the fact.
So far as concerns the depositors, the National’s
position is very strong. Cash and liquid securities
(£2,808,038) are equal to over 37 per cent, of all liabilities
to the public. In spite of large repayments of recon-
structed deposits, the total deposits have increased during
the half-year by nearly half-a-million. The liquid assets
have increased during the half-year by £300,000. But
unless there is some good reason, apart from anything
that appears in the statement of accounts, for the small
profits the National looks at present a remarkably unpro-
mising spec, for the ordinary shareholder. After the
preference shareholder’s div. is provided for, the balance
only amounts to about 11s. 3d. per cent, per annum on the
ordinary capital.
* * * *
The report of the Colonial Bank (Melbourne)
for the half-year to 31st March, 1899, shows a most
remarkable improvement. Some recent returns are as
follows
For the period during which the Colonial paid
4J per cent, on reconstructed deposits.
September, 1893 .. Profit £5,966
March, 1894 .. ~ 9,853
September, 1894 .. ~ 2,247
March, 1895 .. Loss 4,694
For the period during which the Colonial paid 2|
per cent, on reconstructed deposits. Profits :
September, 1895 .. £7BO I March, 1897 .. £3,043
March, 1896 .. 2,564 September, 1897 .. 3,312
September, 1896 .. 2,004 | March, 1898 .. 3,898
For the period during which the Colonial paid 3
per cent, on its reconstructed deposits. Profits :
September, 1898 .. £853 | March, 1899 .. £5,601
The writing-off of lost capital has now been formally
authorised, and the alteration will appear in next bal-
ance-sheet. After allowing for the writing-off, the paid-
up capital stands at £366,882 (preference £304,044, and
ordinary £62,838), and the profits equal £3 Is. Id. per
cent, per annum thereon, which is well up to the average
and seems to suggest that the Colonial has now provided
for all losses and put its affairs on a sound basis. At the
same time, the writing-off has left the Colonial a very
small institution indeed compared to what it used to be.
A 3 per cent, dividend is paid to preference
shareholders (the first they have received since the 5 per
cent, of March, 1894), which absorbs £4561, leaving a pro-
fit balance of only £lO4O. Considering that the Colonial
has now no vestige of a reserve-fund, that the entire
shareholders’ funds are below £367,000, that this is the
first time in five years that the institution has earned
enough to pay even 3 per cent, on preference capital,
and that it is too soon yet to be certain that the very sud-
den improvement of the present half-year will be main-
tained, the declaration of a dividend was supreme
foolishness. The Colonial should have put : £5OOO
to reserve, and it would he time enough to start
paying 2£ per cent, dividends (not more) next half
if things keep up. The business in general is improving
greatly : note circulation has gone up during the last six
months ; new private deposits have increased by £228,000
(from £650,000 to £878,000) ; Government deposits have
increased by over £200,000; cash and liquid securities
have increased by £361,000 and now equal about 28 per
cent, on liabilities to the public ; and reconstructed de-
posits have been reduced by £114,000 and now stand at
only £1,152,823. In fact, everything looks well, except
the frantic haste to resume dividends instead of
strengthening the bank’s p osition, which haste looks very
bad indeed.
» * • *
The steady improvement in the affairs of the
little Royal Bank, the one Melbourne bank which went
triumphantly through the smash of ’93, still continues.
The net earnings for the six months, which closed on 31st
March, are £4314, which compares with some previous
profits as follows :
March, 1893 .. £2510 Stq fcember, 1896 .. £2044
September, 1893 .. 1901 March,. 1897 .. 3398
March, 1894 .. 3258 September, 1897 .. 3625
September, 1894 .. 2875 March, 1898 .. 3864
March, 1895 .. 2136 September, 1898 .. 4088
September, 1895 .. 2038 March, 1899 .. 4314
March, 1896" .. 2099
Profits equal £5 I,ls. 4d. per cent, per annum on share-
holders’ funds (capital £150,000, reserve-fund £5000),
which is considerably above the average bank-earnings
nowadays, and shows the Royal as one of the best profit-
earning institutions in Australia. The usual dividend of 3
per cent, absorbs £2250, and the remaining £2064 raise the
accumulated profits to £BO4l. Of this, £soooare applied to
start a new reserve-fund, and £3041 are carried forward.
The action of the Royal Bank management in keeping its
dividend down to 3 per cent., even while earning over SJ,
Cannot be too highly commended, and the longer it con-
tinues in this course the sooner will the Royal recover its
boom-time losses and get back to its old position. The
deposits show an increase from 1280,000 last half to
£321,000. Cash and liquid securities (£112,124) show an
increase of £26,000 and equal over 30 per cent, on all
liabilities to the public. And the Royal has no recon-
structed deposits or preference capital or other such
worries and obstructions to hamper its operations, which
is no small advantage.
Now that the Royal has again come into pos-
session of a reserve-fund there is an opportunity to
attempt an innovation which might do a lot of good. The
reserve should he separately invested in Government
securities (the Royal has no holding of Government
securities now, which is a distinctly weak point in its
defences), and it should be provided that the interest de-
rived therefrom shall not go into the general profits, but
shall be added to the reserve and similarly invested
until the fund reaches, say, £500,000. In other words,
the fund should be left to increase automatically by com-
pound interest. It might be assisted out of surplus profits
to any extent the management thought advisable, but until
it reaches a really solid figure no management should be
allowed to annex the interest derived from it for
dividend-paying purposes. With good investments the
slow grind of compound interest is the next surest thing
to the grinding of the mills of God—and very often it
happens that compound interest is the more rapid
grinder of the two.
* » * *
The Bank of Australasia is another institution
which shows signs of improvement this half-year. Ac-
cording to its rather dilatory balance-sheet for the half-
year ended 10th October, 1898, the net profits are t'54,148
(of this £5OOO goes to premises account). These re-
sults compare with some previous ones in I his fashion :
October, 1892 .. £80,346 April, 1896 .. £40,568
April, 1893 .. 60,742 October, 1896 .. 40,400
October, 1893 .. 60,607 April, 1897 .. 45,376
April, 1894 .. 48,571 October, 1897 .. 40,278
October, 1894 .. 45,735 April, 1898 .. 48,547
April, 1895 .. 40,854 October, 1898 .. 54,148
October, 1895 .. 41,159
The late half-year is therefore the best which the ’Asia
has experienced since October, 1893, the profits equaling
£4 10s. 3d. per cent, per annum on shareholders’ funds
(capital £1,600,000, reserve-fund £800,000). A 6 per
cent, dividend is declared (' 48,000), £5OOO are written
off premises, leaving £ll4B to carry forward; this
is the second 6 per cent. div. which the ’Asia
shareholders have received after a long pilgrimage
through the disappointing wildernesses of 5 per cent.
The business looks as solid and prosperous as usual.
Total liabilities to the public are £15,270,000, and the
reserve of cash and liquid securities reaches the immense
figure of £4,800,000. Altogether, if the proprietors are
not fully satisfied, they ought to be.

“ Thorold ” : Sydney P.O. Savings Bank gradu-
ally settles down to utter uselessness to its proper clien-
tele. It is open daily from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. (Saturdays,
10 till noon), which hours are quite prohibitive to the
ordinary toiler, although he is allowed two hours on
Saturday nights, during which he may deposit money,
but cannot withdraw it. If he wants to withdraw from
the bank he is, seemingly, to take a day off for the pur-
pose. Govt, will not cash cheques of any kind, even at
the G.P.0., so that the man who has a crossed cheque is
put to trouble, and sometimes expense, to cash it with
some private firm. And when the writer wished to
deposit money the other Saturday evening, the suburban
official refused to take a P.O. order because the books had
been locked away in the safe during the afternoon.

The naval coal question has become acute in
Melbourne. Admiral Pearson wants local merchants to
let their contracts stand in war-time ; but merchants
justly fear blockade, in which case they might have to
carry coal overland, which would make it cost £5 a ton.

Falkners, Pambula (N.S.W.), has put up a
deposit for the purchase of the Mt. Gahan property, and
the local wire-hummer goes on to say that the Hidden
Treasure tributors are opening up a recent discovery,
“which promises to be very rich, if it continues.”
Nature’s hidden treasures generally do.

The Sulphide Corporation’s success with the
Central now that it has dropped the Ashcroft experi-
ments has spurred another English co. to negotiate for
the North and Junction North ; the Junction is also in-
cluded, but the Camden Syndicate has too many teeth in
that—unless, of course, the Consolidated Mines Selection
Co., which is making the negotiations, is the Camden
Syndicate. Elaborate surveys and inspections have
already been made. If Australian mining co.’s can’t in-
dividually treat their zinc products at a profit, why don’t
they combine ? Others can do it ; there is pretty good
ground for the statement that Block 10’s zincs alone yield
the buyers something over £70,000.

Cow Flat, N.S.W. At last something definite
seems to have happened this old-time mine. Cabled that
it has passed into the hands of the Colonial Copper Cor-
poration ; capital, £125,000 ; of which £60,000 is to be
issued in shares. Writer wishes it luck, and hopes the
English shareholders will never have reason to think of
themselves as Bull flats. Cow Flat was a great mine
some 20 years ago when Lewis Lloyd, the owner of Bur-
raga copper-mine, made big money out of it. It may be a
great mine again if it has great luck. It closed down some
15 years ago, since which absolutely nothing has been
done on it. Writer passed by it some weeks ago and
found some goats trying to feed on it; not a man any-
where. There are, of course, all sorts of stories as to
rich bodies of ore left in the old workings. The old
warrior who worked it last was asked, some time ago, if
it were true that he had left Bft. of rich copper-ore. He
simply wanted to know if he looked like a man of that
kind. Anyhow, somebody has to be congratulated on the
float. The management of other mines in the district—
notably, Mount Apsley—should be called upon to explain
why they are sinking while others are floating around
them.
* * * *
At Moonta (S.A.) mines 50 tons of vein stuff
have to be raised to produce one ton of copper, and this,
too, from a shaft 2400 ft. deep. At present 2000 tons of
dirt are raised weekly, the ore-product (averaging 20 per
cent, of copper) being 250 tons. The Wallaroo mines,
where the deepest shaft is 1650 ft., produce the same
amount of copper ore each week. About 1800 men find
employment on the amalgamated properties.
The Eveleen, the Northern Territory silver
show, still gives work for the lawyers—much more than
for miners. Registered in Sydney, a winding-up order
was made, and heavy calls struck. S.A. shareholders,
who kick against the expense of liquidation, refused to
pay. The N.S.W. officers’ order could not, it was argued,
be enforced in S.A., because there was no machinery for
serving notice. But, after long argument, the S.A.
Court has decided, in a test-case, that the order as to
calls was not judicial but administrative, and that, having
made themselves liable by taking shares, the shareholders
were compellable to pay the calls.
* * • *
No wonder the price of copper started upwards
three months ago, until it has reached within sight of £BO
a ton, in view of the facts that have come to light within
the last few days, but the incubation of which must have
commenced about the time the metal began to move. A
couple of months ago, present writer heard in a letter
from America of the gigantic operations of the Standard
Oil Go., of America, in the scrip of certain big copper-
mines of that country, more particularly in that of the
Calumet and Hecla. It was then given out that this huge
organisation, which controls the world’s petroleum supply,
contemplated taking a hand in the world’s copper busi-
ness, compared to which the transactions of the French
Copper Syndicate would be found insignificant—that its
policy was to buy up copper-mining shares, and thus con-
trol productions instead of contracting for the outputs
themselves, to which the collapse of the syndicate was
largely due. Now cabled that a colossal ring, calling
itself the “ Amalgamated Copper C 0.,” has been formed
in New Jersey, controlled by the Standard Oil Trust.
Present capital, 74,000,000 dol., which it is proposed to
increase to 400,000,000 dol. Copper is not likely to go
down for a while under these circumstances. Some
six weeks ago the Calumet and Heela mine paid the
biggest cash div. ever distributed. at one time by one
mine—namely, 4,000,000d01., making 7,000,000d01. distri-
buted during the year.
Obvious that it takes a lot to start a copper-
boom, or we should have had one throughout Australasia
months ago. Signs of one coming appear pretty fre-
quently, but they seem to collapse as suddenly as they
begin. It is marvellous, too, how wonderfully rich the
new copper shows are—on paper. Nearly all reports and
prospectuses give assays of from 20 to 50 percent, copper,
and, of course, there is plenty of it. Everything below
10 per cent, is regarded as rubbish, or mullock—quite un-
mindful of the fact that Mount Lyell and Cobar, the
two biggest and steadiest producers of Australasia, are 4
percent, mines and enormous div. -payers at that; that
Lake George appears to be making a substantial monthly
profit with under 2 per cent, copper ore, containing little
gold and silver ; that the lodes in the Moonta mine are
small and worked at a big profit with copper contents
only under 3 per cent.; that Burraga, probably the rich-
est long-worked producing mine in Australia, is under 10
per cent. Yet these delusions in the way of “gilded-pill ”
prospectuses continue to come out, and fools find food
for enthusiasm in them. There is not a copper-mine in
the world where rich copper samples could not be ob-
tained for assay purposes, and there is a mighty differ-
ence between assaying a copper-mine for the purpose of
floating it, and working one in such a way as to pay even
miners’ wages.

It isn’t “ nice ” to find a Mines Minister
(Bulletin isn’t talking of N.S.W.) borrowing large sums
at interest from a big mine-owner, who has occasion to
make frequent application for suspension of labor-condi-
tions, and so on. It places the Minister in a false position
—and it would be far better if he borrowed from some-
bodv else.

What does it matter if a generation ago some
scientist did say that Bendigo wouldn’t give any-
thing payable below 400 ft. ? The dictum used, locally, to
be attributed to Murchison, not M‘Coy ; but, whether it
was the one’s or the other’s or neither’s, it was probably
true enough as things were then. Compressed air, im-
proved pumps, light steel ropes, boring machines, “ high”
explosives—these and a few other things, the product of
the last 20 years, have made all the difference. And in 20
years more? * *
“ Mount Mercer, b. Is., s. Is. 6d.” raises the
question as to whether the Vic. Minister of Mines hadn’t
better refrain from beating the drum at “ first-crush ”
luncheons. Shares were quoted at 40s. or more when
Minister Foster poured his benediction on the first crush
and assured the company and newspaper reporters that
he felt as proud of the Mercer success “ as though he were
a shareholder.” A drop from 40s. to a bare “ bob” within
three months is rather rough on any investors who put
their faith in Foster’s pride. Foster must curb his pride.
Not very long ago he was proud, he said, at_ being asked
to lead a deputation of Mount Deddickskites in their
brazen demand for a railway to certain alleged mines.
With the repulse of that deputation by Premier Turner,
the last spark of vitality in the Deddick business flickered
out. The mountain remains where it was, but the mines
have more or less vanished.
Vic. Govt. Metallurgist Jenkins, who was lately-
dragged up to Mt. Deddick by the eternal Begelhole, ha?
published a report which, if placed side by side with the
boomsome “ reports from the field’’ of 18 months ago,
might suggest to the Vic. Govt, the advisability of blush-
ing. In the light of Minister Foster’s official barracking
for a Deddick railway, and Minister Peacock’s legal
management of Deddick properties, the Gov. metallur-
gist’s report has a ghastly appearance. Says Jenkins :
“ Out of a large number of specimens collected by me on
the field not one contained more than the merest trace of
gold ; some were quite barren, and whilst there was not
enough lead in the quartz lodes to be remunerative,
silver was only present to the extent of an ounce or two
per ton, and copper, where present, is in very small
quantity indeed. One impression remains after going
over the field. Quite apart from the expenditure of
money in leqitimately proving the barrenness of reefs, one
has the impression of there having been a great expendi-
ture of money in unskilful and sometimes quite needless
work, doomed from the outset to failure.”

Mt. Morgan : 135th div., 7d. ; total to date,
£5 os. sd. per share—£s,o2o,ooo. Where is there such
another gold-mine? Shares worth about £5 Bs., a
market-value a little more than that paid in divs. When
the mine had not one-third the record the shares were
three times the present price. Mine now worked purely
as an investment, perhaps more conservatively than any
other gold-show in the world. Many years’ work in sight.
It would not be difficult for the directors to double yields
and divs., but how long would it last ? And they are not
built that way.

Queensland Mining and Prospecting Co, has a
lot of copper blocks in Chillagoe country. Meeting at
Melb. last week. Profit and loss account shows expendi-
ture for half-year £1539, including £lOOO voted to Mr.
Johnson to cover expenses of London flotation. Same ok)
business, spending more money in flotation than sinking.

doing something substantial in Melbourne—they are

“ Dunn, discoverer of the Wealth of Nations,

find it.

Bayley’s Great Oversight is a badly-named mine
in Coolgardie. Meeting last week in Melb., when the
only consolation shareholders received was the statement
that the management of Bayley’s were determined that
no information concerning a recent find in that mine
should be conveyed to the directors of the Oversight, and
employes had been threatened with instant dismissal if
they exchanged any words with the Oversight men. No
doubt even this yabber went down, and induced a few
people, who admit that they have been living on hope for
years, to put up a long-delayed 2d. call. It will be a
great oversight if others are not made.
This year’s Victoria Cross for nerve ought to go
to the vendors of the Balia Balia copper-mines, a Westra-
lian proposition which was plumped before Bull during
the recent copper excitement. The vendors wanted
£200,000 in cash and shares (£25,000 in cash certain), and
asked for another £50,000 to be subscribed. They owned
up that if Bull “ parted ” they would do pretty well out of
the deal; but beyond that they gave no very cogent
reasons why he should do anything Of the sort.

J. Bull has been tempted with still another
Westralian jarrah concession ; for a trifle of £25,000 in
cash, £85,000 in paid-up shares, and £5OOO as the direc-
tors please, he has got hold of eight square miles of Quin-
dalup jarrah country (half the 28 years’ lease of which, by
the way, has expired), Yelverton’s mill, and some other
Bunbury options. The venture was apparently under-
written ; capital, £175,000. This makes the tenth Wes-
tralian wood co. floated in London since the Millars'
Karri Co., a £350,000 affair, swam off in May, ’97.

Wired from Greenbushes (Westralian) tinfield
that there is room for 3000 men there. Yet, when there
were less than 200 on the ground, all the country any-
where near the old workings (i.e., anywhere near the
eyes) was taken. It is just as well to remember that
Greenbushes has been well known for 12 years known to
miners, scientific men, and boonisters. During the
Euriowie boom of eight or ten years ago several Broken
Hillionaires inspected it, and passed. The presumption
regarding every tin discovery is that it won’t pay ; yet
few “ shows ” are more alluring than a tin lode.
Lake View Consols, Kalgoorlie. About to
despatch the largest and richest consignment of ore ever
received in one parcel by any smelting works in Austral-
asia, consisting of a thousand tons of sulphide ore,
averaging from 25 to 30oz. per ton. Estimated gross
value, £120,000. Dapto works (N.S.W.) are the successful
tenderers for the parcel, arrangements for which were
made six weeks ago by a Lake View representative of the
co. who visited the different custom smelting-works.
Some tall yarns have been wired as to the width and
length of the lode, from which the 1000 tons were taken
as an average. No doubt it was the accumulation of
selection extending over five or six months when a rich
bonanza was struck in the 300 ft. lode, and it has been
considered better to send such rich stuff away than to let
it go through the co.’s own sulphide works.

Peak Hill, West Australia, Wired that the
jury in the alluvial case were discharged, failing to agree
after being locked up 16 hours. Both sides making a big
fight in this matter. Whispered that holders who got
out at much less than present prices a<re now fighting on
the alluvial side. Truly a nice kettle of fish, for which
the indefiniteness of Westralian mining law is respon-
sible. Shares in London £B, representing a value
of £2,000,000. Last crushing, 1800 tons, 54000 z. This
reads remarkably well when given without details,
but writer can find no record of any previous
clean -up since the beginning of Feb., and, taking
the record for the last 12 months, this yield W'ould
represent about the average for the time, namely, pearly
three months. During Feb. and some of March they had
the old ten-head battery running; since then the
new 20. Even if the ten closed down after the
20 started, the tonnage is altogether too small
for so many heads running on unusually soft
stpff, the gold in which is so coarse as not to necessitate
fine crushing ; and where all the conditions are favorable,
certainly, in the time, the tonnage should be double.
Even if the co. can maintain such a gold production, what
interest will it pay on two millions of money? Some
mystery in this market somewhere.
Kalgoorlie Mine Managers’ Association has a
committee now at work drafting a scale of wages. It is
laboriously explained on the spot that it is not proposed
to “ cut ” wages —only to get over the trouble experienced
by some managers who are asked for higher pay for Sun-
day and special work on the ground that certain other
bosses pay this higher rate. Boiled down, then, the
present movement seems to he one to ascertain the lowest
rates paid and to scale them as the standard.

From London: In Westralians, several im-
potent attempts made to take advantage of the overflow
from South Africa. Great Boulders still being talked
into better prices on the reported success of the Kone-
man process (the failure of which has since given the
directors the pip). Golden Horseshoe goes merrily on,
but those speculators who are regretting that they were
not in the movement may condole themselves with the
reflection that, if the public had been in, the price would
never have risen as it has done.
N. Territory men lost no time after the TJ.S.

which a new market is badly wanted, they will have to
wait till things settle.

The long-ton business is practised everywhere,
perhaps nowhere more so than in Westralia. “Now,”
said the managing-director, “ I want you to crush 100
tons.” “ But,” said the boss, “ there are 300 tons here.”
“ Never you mind ; make it 100 tons, and don’t leave a
barrowful behind.” “ And what did you do ? ” “ Well I
gave him long tons and very short ozs., and I panned off a
lot of the scrip as we)l meanwhile.

The Austral Otis Engineering Go. Ltd., South
Melb., has completed and delivered a very fine set of
winding engines for the Oobar Gold Mines, N.S.W., capable
of hauling a load of two tons from 1500 ft. at a speed of
1000 ft. per minute. The engines are a pair of 14" cylin-
ders, geared to 7ft. loose drum, and are fitted with link
motion reversing gear, vertical indicators, and powerful
brake gear. The pair of engines are set to one side of the
drums, and all the driving levers are brought behind the
drains. The co. has also just delivered a fine set of
pumping plant for the Paddy Lackey mine for taking ,the
shaft down to 1000 ft.

A visitor to a much-talked-of English-owned
mine in N.S.W. asked the manager, “ What are you doing
here?” “Drawing a big screw!” “Who pays it?”
“ The blarsted Britisher, of course ! ” “ And bow long
will it last?” “ Until the blanky battery starts, and then
I’m off for the benefit of my health ! ”
The smuggling of 30,000 sheep over the
Murray at Goo ram ad da hy the manager for
David Mitchell (Melba’s canny dad), throws a
significant light on the extent of the border
evasions. If the removal of a slip-panel near a
Customs station can account for 30,000 head from
one run, what numbers must be smuggled into
Vic. yearly by other means ! The cost of pontoon
bridges would be nothing to the capitalist who
wished to get a few thousand sheep over f.o.d.
There is nothing surprising in Glassey
being deposed from the position of leader of
Queensland Labor-party. Though he founded it,
was the first Labor member, and probably stood
more abuse than the average man could stand, the
party has all along felt that a leader had yet to
come. Besides, Glassey has grown too moderate
for the ideas of the A.L.F., but probably this
development will pave the way for a seat in the
Cabinet as the representative of that department
in which he used to be employed as a letter-
carrier. Dawson, of Charters Towers, is.to be the
new hand at the bellows.

Maoriland has the lowest birth-rate and
far the lowest death-rate in all the Seven Pro-
vinces, and its birth-rate, like that of all the other
provinces, is decreasing steadily. In 1882 there
were 37 births for every 1000 inhabitants ; in ’9B
there were only 25. Marriages keep increasing all
the time, but where the average used, in ’B2, to be
nearly six children to every marriage, it is now
less than four. Maoriland in general is growing
alarmed over this state of things, and wonders if
the population will stop increasing through people
getting out of the habit of being born, and then
begin to diminish, and finally, if the M.L. nation
will miss its destiny almost before it got started.
And the country is full of people with theories
about the cause—the favorite ones being godless-
ness, drink, want of respect for “our betters,”
socialistic legislation, and too much knowledge
how to dodge the small baby-encumbrance. Yet,
after all, there is nothing so very difficult about
the problem. Twenty years ago Maoriland was
still peopled mostly by the new immigrants—men
and women in or near the prime of life —and these
are the kind of people who are in the habit of hav-
ing children. Now a lot of these people have grown
old, and as Maoriland is so healthy that people
hardly ever die there, they simply stay round and
remain old. These old iniquities have gone out of
the parent industry for various reasons. Maori-
land has the smallest birth-rate of all the provinces
because it is so healthy, and has the smallest death-
rate—it simply contains a larger proportion of
people who are too old to have children than any
other province.
That is part of the matter, anyhow, but, in addi-
tion, the baby-encumbrance grows more unpopular
as civilisation advances. In very primitive com-
munities almost the only amusement is getting
married, therefore people get married young. And
THE NEXT ISSUE.
“ Remittance men, look out for next issue. Something
important."— S.M. HERALD adit.
where there is little expense in the way of educa-
tion, and nobody objects to sleeping 14 in a
room, and it doesn’t matter much whether
the baby has anything on or not, almost
the only requisite is sufficient floor-space for the
new infant to crawl on, and a dust-hole in the
back-yard for him to wallow in, and a eat whose
tail he can drag. In a really primitive community
it doesn’t matter much if there are two children
or 14, so long as the boiled potatoes hold out and
the cat’s tail doesn’t come right off. But a com-
munity that has expensive prejudices about wash-
ing and dressing and educating the offspring, and
having his hair singed, has to limit the supply.
There is no visible remedy for it. The only reason
why the primitive races which let the naked
family crawl economically under the table don’t
overrun the earth is that they die fast in addition
to being born fast.

“It is well known to those who have to
deal with the Sydney poor ” (writes a Bulletin
correspondent) “ that the needy sick stealthily
refuse, whenever they can, to accept admission to
the privately-managed subsidised hospitals where
they are nominally under the care of “ honorary ”
surgeons or physicians, but really of “ resident
medical officers ” newly-graduated. These people
all want to go to the state-managed and state-
supported Coast hospital, where there are no
“ honorary ” doctors, and those who are there,
having no private practices to attend to, give their
whole time and best skill to the hospital.

S.A.’s intensely serious and self-confident
new Governor evidently runs to oratory, for he has
seized every opportunity since his arrival. His
speeches, unlike poor Buxton’s, have good literary
quality and are commendably short. The oratori-
cal fever extends to Lady Tennyson, who can
talk “ with the best of them,” and has quite cap-
tured her own sex with her unaffected manner on
public occasions.
The Buxton regime had brought vice-regality to
freezing-point, so that it needed but little guber-
natorial warmth on the part of the Tennysons to
cause the mercury to ascend. Gov. Buxton hardly
ever remembered a face ora name, and so mortally
offended heaps of people who considered them-
selves important.

The new Maoriland divorce
law removes one weird anomaly of
the old statute. Formerly if a
M.L. husband deserted his wife
and left the province the courts
held that the divorce law didn’t
apply to her ; she had no domicile
in the country even if she had been
born and had spent her whole life
there. The old man took her domi-
cile with him, and if he went to
England or the U.S. or Prussia she
could only follow him and apply in
the courts there. Under the old law
a M.L. husband could take his
wife’s legal rights with him all over
the earth and keep them in-
definitely. It was an ass of a law,
and the shadow of its long ears has
cast a gloom over the M.L. statute
book for many years.

said, “for God’s sake, bring me a

heard of the request, and walked up
to the hut. “I am the anointed of
God,” he said ; “ I am silenced, but my sacred
office never leaves me until I die. I will give you
the last consolations of the church.” Hedid, and
comforted the dying man and his mate.

Mr. Finnerty, chairman of Westralian gold-
fields Quarter Sessions, doesn’t even always make
a pretence of charging the jury. The other day,
when the Mayor of Kanowna and a few others
were charged with sooling two men on to a fatal
fight (at any rate, one of the pair died just after
the fight), it was simply, “ Gentlemen, consider
your verdict,” when counsel had completed their
addresses. In other words, the prosecution was
left vvith the last say. Surely it is about time the
goldfields had a Judge, and not a police magistrate,
to take the Quarter Sessions work.

The defence of Fox in the Dalkeith

In N.Q., a woman who was housekeeping
for a widower had three children by him. Said
widower, who had four children by a deceased
wife, died recently, whereupon housekeeper at
once got permission from the State Orphanage
authorities to keep the seven children on the

“ C.S.” : Be mention of
youth addicted to torturing
fowls and such-lilce. About
nine years back, up North, a
young man, son of people in
good social position, was con-
victed of the murder of a
German new-chum. Murderer
and victim stayed at same
boarding-house. Victim went
off to a bush job on foot.
Murderer followed him up,
and bashed his head in for
value of swag and a few shil-
lings. Subsequently became
known that murderer in
childhood used to cut off
fowls’ legs to enjoy seeing
them struggle abound on
bleeding stumps. Also de-
lighted in amputating cats’
ears and tails, and jabbing fire-
sticks into frogs’ and lizards’
eyes. Later on, at the age of
14, this young devil was in a boat
with another boy who could not
swim, and other boy was mysteri-
ously drowned. Now known that
he was thrown overboard “ for a
lark,” and hammered on head with
oar—also for fun ! Subsequently,
a solitary old Austrian basket-
maker was found murdered in his
humpy, and his poor savings stolen.
Crime never sheeted home, but
now pretty certain that it was
the work of this human fiend.
Several other disappearances put
down to same criminal, who, by
the way, resided awhile with
some semi-civilised blacks until
even they couldn’t stand his
fiendishness. All this pro-
mises a lively future for the
district to which youth men-
tioned in B. l/4/’99 betakes
himself when he leaves re-
formatory.

the result that stock are constantly

in this way so far, except derailing the
engine. One of these days, perhaps, the

“ Puyyaka ” to The Bulletin re leprosy :
Judging from the results of recent observations in
leprosy, it behoves the Queenslander 10 regard bis pro-
boscis'with suspicion, and to use a nasal douche at regular
intervals. The great length of the apparent incubatory
period of the disease (before the development of skiri-
tubercles and nervous symptoms) was a standing puzzle
until Jeanselme noted the exceeding prevalence of nose
and throat complications in the early stages. The micro-
scope showed the characteristic bacillus of Hansen in the
discharge from such lesions. Sticker followed up the
clue in India, identifying the bacillus in the
nasal discharge of 83'6 per cent, of lepers ex-
amined by him. Further research tends to prove the
initial lesion of leprosy to consist of a specific ulceration
of the cartilaginous division of the nose. This may be
present for years before any other symptom shows up,
and is an active source of infection from its commence-
ment. The ulcer is easily recognisable on examination,
and by its spread produces the disorganisation of
mucous membrane and cartilage which leads to the
almost characteristic “ binocular nose ” of the developed
disease. Both Jeanselme and Sticker, together with
Laurens, another well-known observer, have stated that
occasional Vmt persistently-recurring nose-bleed is one of
the earliest evidences of leprosy, and that in an infected
locality it is probably quite as indicative a symptom as
blood-spitting in early lung-tubercle. The importance of
such a discovery is enormous, as affording a means by
which lepers can be detected and isolated at an early
stage. At present an infectious person has a term of
years in which to spread the seeds of his ghastly burden
through the community.

shouting, laughing, dancing like modern Maenads

almost worthy to rank beside the babblings of
Melbourne D.T., in the pious boomtime of that
short-lived journal, when Parson Fitehett was
editor, and Matthew Davies, James Balfour and
Jimmy Munro provided its means of subsistence.
The D.T.—R.I.P. ! —would publish a column
of Sunday-school-treat literature (next to the
cable reports, as a rule) dealing with the pictur-
esque appearance of the snow-white refreshment
tent in the foreground, and the beautiful benevo-
lence of Davies, Balfour and Munro, in providing
lemonade and buns of the choicest description.

Of all Westralia, the Boulder district
alone still lives in the champagne age. When
Premier Bigjohn went there the other day there
was a mayoral reception at 11, a champagne
luncheon at 1, a champagne public reception at 4,
a champagne banquet (at Kalgoorlie) at 8. And
a few of ’em had a little supper afterwards.

Although Jawbone Neild has doubtless
made a superlative ass of himself, his superiors are
no better. The N.S. W. Vohmteer Act gi ves no real
power of punishment, and Neild’s offence (if any)
not having been committed when on duty, he is
not amenable to said Act and regulations. Neild
is an unpaid volunteer, and it is very doubtful if
he can be called to account for insubordination
when not actually on duty. “Insubordination”
is an elastic term, and has a meaning quite dis-
tinct from disobedience on duty or backwardness
in action. The good soldier who “grumbles and
goes ” is “ insubordinate,” and even a black look
may be “ insubordination,” if the superior officer
likes to call it so.

A Sydney woman had an adventure with a
burglar last week. She woke up about 3.30 a.m.
and saw a man in the act of getting through the
bedroom window.
When she informed
hubby of the fact, he
sleepily declared it
to be all “ rot.”
The burglar was
half-in and half-
out, nicely bal-
anced on the
window-sill
with a 14ft.
drop beneath
him, and, be-
fore he could
make up his
mind what to
do, the woman,
begging her
husband to tell
where he had
put the revol-
ver, seized the
long narrow
Defries lamp-
glass, and,
clicking the
burner - catch,
' made a noise
_ like cocking a
pistol, stepped
out of bed and
covered the bmglar
with thedeadlyweap-
on. With a shriek
the' brigand fell into
the room and lay on the floor conjuring
her in the name of Heaven not to shoot.
Then the husband woke up in a rage,
and requested his pet-lamb not to make
such an infernal row, but to get into
bed, and not try to shoot his only suit ;
facetiously remarking that if she fired
that thing through it it would be utterly
ruined. At last he was persuaded to
look inside the curtains, and there, sure
enough, was a man with his head be-
tween his knees. The startled husband
seized a razor and loudly proclaimed his
intention of cutting the marauder’s
throat. That scared party crawled as far
away as possible and declared that he was
merely an inoffensive drunk who had got
through the wrong window, and only wished to
depart peaceably; but the husband said he
thought he had better cut his throat before he let
him go. At a word from his wife- he reluctantly
consented to let him go with his jugular un-
severed, and opened the door. In order to keep
out of range of the wife’s lamp-glass the visitor
was departing on his hands and knees when the
impatient host closed the door with violence, and
hit the visitor hard on the soles of his feet and
his. hinder parts generally, and fired him down the
stair.

The two escapees from Hobart gaol, after
over a month’s absence, were both recaptured.
One of them, who apparently hadn’t been able to
get rid of the prison clothes, was re-arrested in a
starving state within 20 miles of Hobart; the
other had never left the city, and for weeks had
hobnobbed with all, small and sundry, including
numerous policemen. Hair-dye, a good suit of
clothes, and plenty of pocket-money supplied by
friends, seem to have done the trick and to have
enabled him to lodge “ unbeknownst ” at a cottage
not 300yds. from a police-station. The pocket-
money was his undoing, for he got on a mild sort
of spree at a central hostelry, and spent the whole
of one day “shouting” for casual callers. As
Hobart is no longer a busy whaling port, or the
home of the remittance-man, the spectacle of a
well-dressed stranger, whom nobody seemed to
know, but w ho appeared to know everybody, treat-
ing all comers, naturally created suspicion ; and
the police came, saw, and conquered. It is only
fair to record that not until prisoner had been
lodged in gaol, and the disguise peeled off him,
were the arresting constables quite sure that they
hadn’t collared some beery belated bagman in-
stead of the “ man who was away ” without
leave.
It was a monstrous thing to sentence those
escapees to six months in irons and one month’s
solitary confinement. Such a penalty is worthy
only of Lagland in Lagtime. The love of liberty,
even under such circumstances, should be treated
rather as a negative virtue than as a positive
crime; it is undoubtedly the Law’s duty, when
putting a man into gaol, to see that the gaol is
(unlike that at Hobart) tolerably secure. The
escapees committed no violence when absconding—
they simply walked out on the roof and went off
quietly—nor did they behave otherwise than as
very harmless citizens while away from custody.
One of them, at least, seems to have preferred to
starve rather than steal. Yet the two well-fed
aldermanic Jaypees have seen fit to impose a
penalty which a mutilated warder or a half-mur-
dered policeman would scarcely be an excuse for.

The leading feature of the Mansfield (Vic.)
murder-case has been Detective-Sergeant Dungey,
of course. Dungey went to the scene of the
crime ; Dungey came back to Melbourne ; Dungey
returned to Mansfield, and so on. Finally an
arrest was made during Dungey’s absence, and
then Dungey rushed back to Mansfield. Just
now there is an unwritten police departmental
law, requiring that all murders and other notorious
crimes must be committed for the immediate
benefit of Dungey, whose character as an active
and intelligent officer is under orders to loom large
in the public Eye.

Ex-prisoner to The Bulletin :
Mr. Panton, Melli. P.M., in recently sentencing a man,
rebuked prisoner’s friends for offering to give hiin em-
ployment if he were let off—said it was shameful that
a man, when discharged from gaol, was received with
open arms by his friends. Seemed to think that all a
once-convicted man was good for was to he as speedily as
possible brought up and gaoled again. The Pantoniau
added statement that Australians generally think it no
disgrace to a man to have been gaoled is a stupid fabrica-
tion. I have been in gaol over a money-misappropriation,
and since my discharge have travelled far but have not
yet been able to get employment, although 1 am willing
for any sort of work ; and I know that more than once the
knowledge that I had been in gaol was the bar. How-
ever, I have managed to keep honest with an odd job and
that assistance from my friends which Mr. Panton so
absurdly snorts about.

A WOMAN'S LETTER.
Sydney, May 2, 1899.
My Dear Myee—
The stories about Lord Beauchamp’s alleged
English attachment are still thriving. As I write,
she was a housemaid (next week she will be a cook,
no doubt), and the Earl sent her to school, and was
sent out to Sydney for doing so. To Sydney—
where the women would never dream of setting
their caps (or aprons) at a lord.
His Excellency’s career is going to start a day
earlier than was expected. He arrives in Sydney
May 18th, and I hear that there will not be all the
processional rites that ushered in the Hampdens.
Among the aides is Lieut. De Crespigny, whose
father was a queer, duty-worshipping aristocrat,
who hanged a man with his own hands just to
make himself familiar with his duties as sheriff.
If the coming De Crespigny makes himself familiar
with his duties as aide m the same zealous way,
the blood of some fat and aggressive persons will be
shed on Govt. House steps this winter.
To start with the supper of a ball isn’t delicate ;
but really, I feel as if I cannot describe the French
ball until I have made my bow to the artistic
collation contributed so generously by the Messa-
geries Co. The ball is a charity for the French
poor of this city, and the gift of the supper was a
great help towards funds. It was a superb effort,
graced with all sorts of cunning foreign salads, and
sweets one never sees anywhere in Sydney, and
French men-of-war’s men who never turned an
eyelash when asked to “donnez-moi two cream
shoes,” or “a little pulley for a dame.”
From this you may—or may not—gather that
the dance was not all “Society.” There were a
good many smart people there, but there were
others who seemed to have been let out with the
hall, which isn’t alivays used for swagger charity
hops. The Frenchy element revealed itself in
pallid men with boned moustaches; and in charm-
ingly-gowned women. Local color betrayed its
vulgah origin by turning restive when the ball
was stopped for nearly an hour to wait the coming
of the vice-regal people. Indignant young men,
who had been frozen with one duty-partner on an
arm for an hour—and the first two dances are
always thrown away by men of sense—broke into
angry clapping as time went on and the orchestra
wasn’t allowed to tune-up. It was a moral lesson
to see the Nicest part of the ball stand patiently
in two long lines, its eye on the door, unable to
laugh or dan.ce or chatter until Govt. House
hacl come.
On the whole, the ball was not well-dressed. So
far in the season no ball has been. But after May
18th there is going to be an outbreak of frocks of
the most dreamlike beauty. Mrs. Lassetter wore
one of the most satisfying dresses in the room.
This consisted of two or three white billowy
chiffon skirts, emerging from a polonaise of black
Breton net, let in with insertion and tucks.
That gifted Melbourne lady, Mdlle. Dreyfus,
sported a Frenchy confection of grey and pink.
The frock proper was of delicate silver brocade.
Over this fell a lace skirt slashed up in
long battlements, that waved about as she danced.
The corsage was cut a good way “off,” and ended
in a row of pink roses. Pretty Madame d’Orgeval,
hon. sec., wore pale green satin, with a diamond
star in her hair. Madame Levic’s frock was a
thing of mind and beauty. Black satin, panelled
with deep gold embroidered chiffon, was the skirt,
and the bodice was brightened with huge revers
of cerise velvet embroidered in gold. Madame
Aengenheyster was in cream silk with little red
flowers on it, and bands of red velvet running
round the skirt. I liked the art of the pretty girl
from Brisbane, who decked the corsage of her
lamp-shade pink silk frock with deeper pink roses.
People are just finding out how becoming a very
deep pink can he. It is the soft, light, tranquil
pink that makes the face look greyer than day-
The night before the French ball, there was
another dance at the same hall. This was given
by Signor Fabris’ friends, and attracted a good
number of people, including a big party from
Mosman’s Bay, where the Signora is now living.
Speaking of singers, people often ask what has
become of Florence Schmidt. The latest news I
have of her is that she is still with the Steffanis.
Accompanied by them, she has been hearing opera
in Paris, and, so far, Steffani has not found any-
thing in her that needs undoing. The only trouble
is that the gifted Schmidt, who is as lazy as all
Queenslanders, has not yet mastered French and
Italian. By this time, the party will be in
London, where arrangements for a public debut
will soon be made. Nobody has heard her sing
yet; a hobby of Steffani’s, no doubt. He always
believed in keeping his pupils for a “ psychologic
moment. ”
The usual crowd rolled up to the Orient Co.’s
wharf to see the Ophir depart on 26th. Some
persons evidently mistook the occasion for a gar-
den party, as they appeared at noon in fete attire.
The fact that Lord Gormanston had booked his
passage from Hobart interested several on board.
Flowers were much in evidence, especially in the
case of Mr. and Mrs. Young, and Miss Lomer,
M.A., late hon. sec. of Sydney University-
Women’s Society, who has gone to settle down in
Westralian wilds with Mr. Yidler for life-partner.
Mr. and Mrs. Howard Willoughby returned to
Melbourne per same boat, and were seen-off by
Mr. Edmund Barton amongst others. The Melb.
e,ditor does not like the federal look of things in
Sydney.
. Seldom has Y. M. C. A. Hall looked more attrac-
tive than on the occasion of Miss Violet Jackson’s
debut before a fashionable and critical audience
last Wednesday (26th). What subtle connection
is there between atmosphere and temperament ?
At first the applause was generous but not enthu-
siastic. When someone arose and closed the win-
dows, immediately encore after encore was de-
manded. Miss Jackson was heard to best advan-
tage in “The Bell Song,” the general opinion
being that she possesses a beautiful and very
powerful but almost entirely colorless voice.
Refinement, strength, and accuracy were all there
—only magnetism is wanting. Madame Keller-
mann played some Wagner-Liszt soli charmingly.
Mr. Burns-Walker warbled of love in all its phases
and cadences, and Mr Campbell, who was not in
very happy vein, contributed some rather impos-
sible recitations.
That delightful body of artists, the Pleyel
string quartette, are giving their first concert of
the season on Wednesday, May 10th, at Sydney
Y.M.C.A. Hall.
Miss Eva Mylott’s concert comes off on Mon-
day, May Bth, at Sydney Y.M.C.A. Hall. Tom
Roberts’s picture of the copper-haired contralto is
on view, as an ad. for the concert, in Nicholson’s
window this week.
Last week was devoted to matinees. “ lolan-
the ” on Wednesday ; “ Lord and Lady Algy ” on
Thursday ; Leon Caron’s successful benefit on
Friday—and what a long programme ! It lasted
nearly four hours. “ Pygmalion and Galatea ”on
Saturday. Between them all, half the theatrical
world has been seen out without its war-paint.
It’s a truth that many of the profession look
better as God made them. One newly-imported
lady in particular, who doesn’t cause any flutter-
ings when the hare’s-foot is applied, turned out to
be, in the natural, a pretty, piquante, profiled girl
in white frock and sailor-hat. Picturesque
Joseph Carne, from the Brough co., looked like a
younger Irving when you saw him without a
moustache. Miss Italia Conti flashed a handsome
pair of black eyes out of a clever, broadly-hewn
face that has not yet been judged by Sydney play-
goers. And then, at the Caron matinee, Julius
.Knight stood round while Brough played
Napoleon. Nap. No. 1 wore a very red tie and a
generous smile, but, after a bit, the smile faded,
and he was seen to go out. Evidently one house
couldn’t hold two N apoleons.
A second visit to “Lord and Lady Algy”
showed me some lovely frocks that escaped notice
in the first fascination of the play. In the fancy-
dress ball scene Mrs. Brough is delightfully
dressed in the new purple-red shade of velvet. A
long-trained skirt falls gracefully round her. Over
it is a jacket of the same velvet that reaches to
her knees. Bold revers of silver embroidery
lighten this dashing costume, and a three-cornered
hat and riding-whip suggest an admirable Di
Vernon. Mrs. Brough looks charming, too, in
her last frock—a black net over white silk, with
long black lace sleeves, and a white hat turned up
from the face with touches of light blue. Grace
Noble’s fancy dress is a not very original one of
pale spangled pink, with a polonaise of deeper
pink brocade, a white wig, and pink roses on the
shoulder. Vara Renny—a black-haired girl with
a wide smile—fits well into a snappy brown and
yellow costume with coat-tails. As for the men,
there is something very jolly about Percy Brough
in his purple suit and white curls. And Morley
as the Young Pretender, with his stocking coming
down, is one of the funniest sights you will see,
even at a fancy-dress ball.
In “Pygmalion and Galatea” there is no dress-
ing to speak of. I hear that Pygmalion designed
his own clothes, and is very proud of his dove-
grey. draperies with a border of Indian red. On
the whole, these are the briefest clothes that Julius
has ever been seen in. Ada Ferrar’s Galatea is
quite her most likeable personation, to my mind.
There is generally something cold and diligent
and worthy in Miss Ferrar’s acting that steals
insidiously from her charm, but her Galatea was
both light and bright, and the gold hair and a
Mary Anderson knob helped out her long white
profile.
Need I tell you that there was a thunder-clap ?
Wilson Barrett left the tradition behind him at
Her Majesty’s, and H.M. Heavens have obeyed
ever since. They rumble sympathetically when-
ever a man is laid under a curse, or a woman wants
to make a long, loud speech at the man who has
treated her so badly. The thunder drives things
home as a fragile woman never could. Lucky for
the New Woman in drama that there is going to
be a New Heaven as well as a New Earth.
Between acts, I looked through the playbill, and
found it was not the light, frivolous, rechauffe
thing most playbills are. The paragraphs are
quite readable, and incline towards literary gossip.
As for the careful blending of advts. and photo-
graphs, it suggests a deep intelligence. Julius
Knight looks out of a halo of coffee and tea, just
the beverages for the good young man who died a
Kerristian; and “ Goody ”is surrounded with the
food dyspeptics may eat with impunity.
“ A White Stocking ” was the name of the little
curtain-raiser to “Pygmalion.” Edward Ferris-
known here as an actor—and Arthur Stewart, are
the joint authors of this nice young effort. As far
as dramatic interest goes, the authors have rather
let it slip through their fingers. Beginning with a
pretty and pliable plot about a dashing young
captain who made a bet to act highwayman to a
rich Somebody and plundered the father of the
girl he loved by mistake, many opportunities offer
themselves, but are not asked in, and the play falls
to pieces at the end. It was charmingly presented,
too. Linda Raymond, in a pretty sea-green chiffon
frock restrained her aggravated comedy methods,
and ,played the Rector’s daughter with just
enough abandon. Harry Plimmer made a hand-
some Captain Faversham but was unreally slow in
posing for the final kissing tableau, and Hawtrey
as Rev. John Stapleton suggested a converted
Sapt who still clung to damn and old Port.
Madame Soldene’s Benefit came off at the
Criterion on Tuesday afternoon to a crowded,
gaily-dressed, gaudily-hatted house. Circle,
stalls and gallery were all packed, and the
society element came out heavily. Miss Ida
Chantry was one of the attractions of the
ben. A tall, auburn-tressed girl, she got
herself up & la Johnny Coleman in a brown
suit, red tie, and long sandy whiskers—a trying
costume for a pretty girl. In a faint little voice,
but with a dash of clever diablerie, she sang, “I
appeared to be there, ” and pleased the house im-
mensely. Phil Newbury sang “The Message”
in his own inimitable style. Then “Les Cloches
de Corneville ” brought out the beneficiare, in
black-and-white striped skirt to the ankles, nut-
brown curly-wig, black velvet corselet, white
hpron, white cap, cerise bow in front. She
brought down the house in the kissing song, and
delivered herself of one of the neatest, funniest
speeches heard in the much-benefiting city of
Sydney.
Writes my Melbourne correspondent:—
“ Here is a belated tale of a Christmastime pic-
nic which makes one shudder awfully now that
winter fires have set in. The picnic happened
somewhere not far from Melbourne on a very hot
day, so warm that one of the perspiring matrons
suggested a dabble in the adjacent stream ‘ for
ladies only.’ A secluded spot was available, and
the men of the party having, been told off to range
themselves around the district and guard them
from any risk of a surprise, the women proceeded
to get lovely and cool in the water, But, before
the sentinels had time to light their pipes, they
were shocked by a volley of shrieks. In another
moment there came a rush of damp, unclad
females up the rugged slopes, and the cry was,
‘ Take them off ! Oh, take them off ! ’ In their
frantic terror the matrons appealed to the first
husbands who came handy, and the single girls
didn’t care which boy they struck first. Every
woman Jill of the party had a host of horse-leeches
sucking her blood. Modesty was out of the ques-
tion, so the curtain fell on a tableau of sympathetic
men picking leeches from their respective patients
with the best possible pretence of being blind to
the skinfulness of the situation. By this time, of
course, a good deal of sorting-out had taken place.
Family groups had been formed, and, what with
coats hung across bushes and other hasty arrange-
ments, the situation was not too tragic.
“ The small stir caused last year at that fashion-
able Warrnambool hotel by certain young women
in Melb. society going down for race-week, and
amusing themselves at dead of night by filling with
water boots left outside the doors, is likely to re-
peat itself ; the same high-spirited party having
engaged the same rooms with the object of ‘let-
ting themselves go.’ On the occasion referred to,
a philosophical indifference to wet feet was strik-
ingly absent. Of all the injured, but one man
kept his temper, a R.O. priest, who, supported by
the consolations of religion, simply remarked that
‘ women were rarely, if ever, known to add to the
comfort of any man.’
“Some Melb. illustrated weeklies lately pub-
lished photos, of the two persons most prominently
connected with the Mansfield tragedy, but—
horror of horrors —tlie young lady depicted as
being “ Anastatia, daughter of the deceased Butler
—since arrested and charged with the murder, ” is
none other than a popular local girl who, years
ago, presented the unfortunate family with her
picture. The alleged representation was annexed
by an over-zealous reporter, with disastrous re-
sults ; but the ruffled plumes of the damsel have
been smoothed by a £3O cheque—a joint bonus for
the blunder. Miss Anastasia Butler, a blossom of
34, boasts of having never faced the lens of a camera,
and obscures herself behind a dark veil to avoid
the efforts of amateurs. So far, she has succeeded.
_ “ One Australasian pro-consul persistently pro-
vides in his own province material for such harrow-
ing real-life romances. To this day, after most
expensive warnings, he winks the other eye, when
he gets the chance, at the naicest and most-care-
fully-hedged-in spinsters of his realm. ’Tis said
that the lamentations of one enraged parent (a
sitter in high places, too), whose chee-ild went a-
jaunting in vice-regal company, rivalled Shylock’s
taking-on re absconded Jessica and his stolen
ducats. In the more recent case, however, Pa
was not bereft of both girl and gold. In fact, if
cash pays for pother, the injured patriarch in
question has no more cause to regret the episode
than his dowried daughter, who, in the thick of
the fuss, abruptly took to herself a husband and
set up housekeeping.
“The craze for sending local talent ’Ome has
taken a literary turn. Mrs. Robert Harper, Mrs.
Cornish, and Mr. levers invite subscriptions for a
volume of poems to be published in London by
Miss Frances Tyrrell-Gill, who hopes to get floated
this month. Miss T.G-. has twice as much ability
as some Victorian scribesses now quartered at the
other end of the world, and she is showing a ten-
dency to grow into a businesslike woman, other-
wise her friends wouldn’t have taken her latest
scheme seriously. The idea is to put the bardess
on the London market with a tidy little sum of
cash in hand and valuable letters of introduction
in her pocket that she may add to her list of sub-
scribers for ‘ln Silence and In Sound,’ and push
her claims to consideration as a magazine writer
and paragraphist before her finances are exhausted.
Tickets (i.e., subscriptions) for the ‘ benefit
volume are on sale at 10s. and ss. each.
“A Melbourne lady, whose husband is in the
bike-trade, lost a gold-nugget brooch the other day
whilst whirling along on her wheel. A St. Kilda
hotel-keeper got a puncture in his tyre the same
day, and took the bike to the shop of the husband
aforesaid, with the result that wifey’s lost brooch
was extricated from the puncture. Providence en-
joys a little joke occasionally.
‘ ‘ Apropos the strange story of a post-card stow-
ing itself into an Argus, travelling to England,
and 08 days later returning to the addressee in
Victoria, here is another, still more extraordinary,
relating to a letter. A document from London
was the other day handed into a Melb. office.
Caught in the flap was a tiny envelope, the face
of which, partly destroyed, left only the name of
a town in England decipherable. Opened, the
note was found to contain a tiny gold heart, and
an offer of marriage from ‘ A Gentleman of
France ’to a lady in England. Letter and trinket
are by now in the hands of the person for whom
they were intended—probably to arrive only to
disturb the loved one’s preparations for marriage
with ‘ the other fellow.’
“To be beautiful it is necessary to suffer. The
small daughter of a small fashionable Melbourne
mamma is experiencing the truth of this French
conclusion at the singularly early age of 18
months. Once a week, swathed in gossamer veils,
and other things of a still more protecting char-
acter, she visits the city to have her nails mani-
cured. So far, no expressions of gratitude are on
record. These will doubtless flow readily enough
later, when maturer years will enable her more
fully to appreciate the parental care and fore-
thought reflecting itself in every polished filbert.
“ Louise Hepner, of New York, packing her
Saratoga trunks, promises only four more per-
formances hereabouts. Longer acquaintance
strengthens the visitor’s claims to belle-hood.
She’s quite the stunner in that snappy white satin
uniform, picked out with gold, while as a bold bad
Parisienne in brief black skirt and bodice slipping
off her broad satin-smooth shoulders, the masquer-
ader reveals enough of her personal charms to
prove herself six times as fine and large a woman
as she seems in her first rfile of a round-backed
Salvation Sal. Sipping tea and nibbling ‘biscuit,’
at the Austral Salon, recently, Miss Hepner
seemed one of the quietest, least self-assertive
women, on the premises. At the eleventh hour,
theatre-goers regret ‘ the Belle’s ’ approaching
departure. Things have crisped and lightened
vastly since her Melb. debut.
“ The claims of she theatre-goers are completely
ignored in the ‘ Belle ’ caste. Heaps of blooming
girls, but not a man capable of thrilling the most
susceptible bust. Girard’s a plum, of course, but
provocative only of Platonic admiration.
“ When Louise Hepner wants to seem a scrap
naughty, she gives a funny little back-kick, just
tilting her brief rear skirts enough to display—
neither piles of laces nor satin tights—just a
glimpse of white calico and a neat pair of knee-
frills. Marguerite Ferguson, the acrobatic ‘Pell-
street girl, ’ can’t economise in her dessous ward-
robe. What with somersaults and such, her
nether toilettes are more to the fore than her
frocks.
“ If hospitality is the passport, Melbourne’s
Mayor M‘Bacharn will get his title. Even during
his flying visit to Westralia, at the opening of
Coolgardie Exhibition, he astonished that weary
place with the magnificence of his ‘invitation
dance.’ For one brief evening it took the pioneer
goldfields town back into the thick of its cham-
pagne days.
Y ours affectionately,
GOULI-GOULI.

Does Premier Reid really go away for a
fortnight’s holiday leaving unoonsidered no less
than five death-sentences?
Vic. Judge Gaunt, who lately sentenced a
man to 14 days’ solitary, claims to be the last of the
Plantagenets, or something in that way.
Mayor Solomons, of Scone, lately killed in
a buggy accident, is tho fourth member of a
family of five to die within the last four years—
two of the four being killed.
Premier Kingston deliberately tempted
fortune by running for West Adelaide at S.A.
elections without a working committee, leaving
the whole canvas to a clerk in his private office.
A pathetic spectacle is that of old Jimmy
Munro, late Victorian Premier and Agent-
General, humping his own “To Let’’ boards
around Armadale (Vic.), in his capacity of a
house-agent.
Dear Bulletin. —You err in stating (B.
8/4’99) that Mr. Harrie Wood originated the idea
of a Ballarat School of Mines. Mr. Bickett—
Bickett, Wood and Walker—was the real origi-
nator. —R.L.
James Healey, dead at Emmaville(N.S. W.)
at 81, headed the Turon rush - in the early gold
days and worked round Australia since. His most
vivid memories were, however, of the coronation
of Queen Victoria, at which function he was
present in Westminster 60 years ago.
Dr. Crowley, the much-advertised medico,
whom the society dames of Melb. Women’s Hos-
pital committee made the scapegoat of their own
incapacity, can now afford to laugh at his enemies.
The will of Crowley, sen., who was proprietor of
Bendigo’s theatre and a trustee of the big Back-
haus estate, has been proved for .£39,000.
Judge Bundey, junior of S.A. Supreme
Court Bench (he has had 15 years’ service there,
nevertheless), who has taken 12 months’ leave in
the hope of restoring badly-shaken health, had
a hard battle to fight before he reached pro-
minence in politics or at the Bar. He has
taken life in desperate seriousness. When in
practice he gave liis conscience a heap of
work to do in deciding which cases he should
undertake and which decline; and since he
has been Judge he has felt it to be his duty
to cut himself off from every social enjoyment.
That and other considerations, mostly financial,
led him to drop yachting, to which he was much
attached. And it hasn’t made his position any
pleasanter that he has oftenest in Full Court cases
been the dissentient Judge.
There is but one Judge m Australia who
left the Bench for the Bar, and in turn the Bar
for the Bench, and that man is Pat. Real, Judge
of Queensland Supreme Court, who was a jour-
neyman carpenter, and a good one, before he
started law; and he is a good lawyer, too.
Thomasßurt, thenonagenarian pioneer who
spoke at last Vic. Eight Hours’ Day luncheon,
is the author of the phrase, “A paradise for the
working man.” Graham Berry once said he would
“ make Victoria a Paradise for the working man,”
but Burt is really the author of the phrase.
H. C. Dangar, M.L.C., who returned to
Sydney per Orotava, was called to N.S.W. bar in
1854, but has never found it necessary to appear
in court for a fee. Generally when legal questions
crop up in the Council he affects more than an
average layman’s innocence of their import.

THE EVENT OF THE WEEK.
Arrived in fairly good order and condition one cricket team. “Training operations begin immediately.” —( Cable.)
Hon. (freshest to date) Sydney Smith,
ex-N.S. W. Minister of Mines, denies that he goes
to England. Bathurst will, he says, take him
back next try. Bathurst is no doubt a fickle con-
stituency. _ Cortis beat Suttor there, and Suttor
beat Cortis; later, Paul beat Suttor, and Suttor
heat Paul.; later again, Sydney Smith beat Suttor,
and Suttor beat S. Smith. On the mere shift and
shift-about principle; S. Smith has therefore
ground for hope. '
Clement the Magniloquent is at it again re
country out Curinamiitla way :—“Bones there,
carcasses around, sheep in extremis yonder, tended
by the crows.so hideous and black. Lively alone
is the übiquitous goat. Not a cloud in the sky,
save a dot of cumulus to northward no bigger than
a man’s hand ; while the impish, eye-gouging
crows caw an ugly, prolonged, and doleful dirge
over this awful tableau of desolation.” Wragge’s
way of saying it’s dry out West.
James Stewart Grant, the 94-year-old
patriarch of Manly, frequently competed over the
draught-board with the lately-deceased “ Herd
Laddie.” About 60 years ago many people pre-
ferred Grant's style of play to that of his famous
rival. Grant was admittedly the best player in
Ireland.
Premier Reid has fixed Federal Referen-
dum day for Tuesday, June 20. If he had gone
one day forward he would have struck Chief
Justice Griffith’s birthday, which would have
been a not inappropriate anniversary for a
Federal poll. Then Chaffey Baker, who was
Chairman of Committees during the Convention,
has a birthday on June 22, which is also the
natal morn of Premier Dick Seddon.
The Abb£ Shurr, who in his 70th year has
been appointed Vicar-General of Armidale, N.S.
Wales, is an old Alsace-Lorraine man, of much
scholastic promise in his young days. He carried
away from French educational establishments
trophies of many kinds, among them one which
attested him to be “ master of all languages
spoken in the civilised world.’’ He came to
N.S.W. 28 years ago and buried himself in mis-
sionary work on the N.S.W. Northern rivers.
“FORBIDDEN FRUIT."
Auctioned recently in Melb., the art-
treasures of the late Dr. Fisher, of whom many
yarns are spun. Fisher’s special antipathy was
strong liquor, and the severance of his connection
with the Argus Sick Fund was caused thusly.
A notorious beer-eater applied for a certif. as an
excuse for absence from the office, and, having
received it, sent it in unopened. It read: “I
hereby certify that H. Longprimer is suffering
from the after-effects of a severe bout of drunken-
ness.” Exit comp., and likewise doc.
Mister James Fairfax has just given £5OO
to the N.S. Wales Y.M.C. A. Better for him at
the gate of heaven hereafter had he planked =£soo
to somehow stir up that wickedly slow old print
of his on the subject of Federation. Yim and
vehemence are wanted now, and there is no more
vim in the wobbly and halfdiearted S.M. Herald
than there is in a pink-eyed rabbit.
Premier Forrest is,
to most people, an enig-
ma. They wonder how
he came to be so powerful
a factor in Westralian
politics. If Eastraliana
knew how he is the be-
ginning and the end of
politics in the West, they
would be still more sur-
prised. While he was
absent from home at the
conference of Premiers in
Melbourne, the annual
financial statement was
published, and one of the
morning papers printed
a strong adverse criti-
cism. There was not a
syllable uttered in reply,
by either the Ministerial
organ or any Minister.
When Forrest returned
he answered the criticism
—after a lapse of weeks.
The Ministerial organ
published a leading arti-
cle commending the Pre-
mier’s reply, and re-
marking how odious and
cowardly it was to
adversely discuss the
finances “in Sir John’s absence.” Similarly,
with the Premier absent through illness, &c., the
Cabinet does not dare to do anything, even routine
business. The secret of it all is that Forrest
stayed in W.A. because he is a pioneer and ex-
plorer, a man of initiative and resource. Theothers
stayed there because they had not the energy to
get out. Forrest has little administrative capacity
or statecraft; but he is a decided personality,
and in a young country that is everything.
F. J. Gillen, the Centralian Pooh Bah,
having seen his aboriginal learning safely booked,
gets a spell down South, after 20 years superin-
tending of the mid-section of the overland tele-
graph. Mr. Bradshaw, of the Adelaide offices,
has gone up to take charge at Alice Springs, the
central station.
A popular movement is afoot down by the
Yarra to testimonialise Melbourne’s first sur-
veyor, Robert Russell, now 92 and travelling a
rocky road. A Govt, annuity is wanted for the
veteran planner and builder, whose wife is also
still living. Russell, who has been for over GO years
in Melbourne, made the original survey of the
Marvellous ; the city owes its wide and capacious
streets to him.
In re Tom Mann, the precedent of Don,
the Melbourne politician of yore, may occur.
Charles Jardine Don, the stonemason, who said
he “ hammered blue-stone by day at the Melb.
General Post Office building, and hammered the
squatters by night, in Parliament,’’ w r as nobbled
by the Tories. They set him up in a Collingwood
publiohouse, and he tried no more to be member
for Collingwood. He soon died.
There is no doubt about who is to succeed
“ General ” Booth in the Salvation Army’s boss-
ship. The eldest son, Bramwell, is marked out
for the job. (By the way, the War Cry an-
nounces, in its recent life of the “ General,” that
he and Mrs. B. were married on June 16, ’55, and
that Bramwell was born March 8, ’s6 which
beats even royalty records.) The boss-designate
is the only clean-shaven and white-haired one of
the crowd. The “ General,” by the way, quite
frankly defends the government of the Army by
the Booth family. “It is the government that
God has invented. It was the government of
Eden ; it is the family government; it is the
patriarchal government; it is the government of
the Mosaic economy; it is going to be the govern-
ment of Heaven.”
Reported from Cairns that Plumper
Hoolan and Ernest Hunter have joined forces.
Such a combination is sure to move something in
the North. Hunter is suspected of being the
wild humorist who, at time of N.S.W. Federal
campaign, wired “collect’’ from Sydney, to the
Mayor of every Queensland municipality, “How
is your town on Federation ? Reply.”
LEON CARON FAREWELLS.
On Saturday night, March 25, Judge
Dashwood, Govt. Resident of the Northern Ter-
ritory, passed sentence of death on five aboriginals.
The Port Darwin paper proudly claims that
Judge Dashwood holds the Australian record, so
far as living persons are concerned, for the pass-
ing of capital sentences. No wonder he has
applied for leave of absence.
Barrister John Garland, who is being in-
cidentally spoken of as a capable successor-to J.
H. Want as N.S.W. Attorney-General, is pro-
curator of Scots law in N.S.W. Presbyterian
Assembly. When that semi-ecclesiastical office
was vacant Premier Reid recommended him for
the post. Few men at N.S.W. Bar possess the
knowledge of Scots law and ecclesiastical prece-
dent which the Presbytery require. Mr. Garland
is an M.A. of Aberdeen and an LL.B. of Edin-
burgh. But he isn’t going to be Attorney-
General this time.
One of Marshall’s Lyle’s hitherto-un-
published Deeming yarns concerns the fears of
the murderer that the scaffold was not as it should
be. Deeming had studied the spot daily on his
way to the exercise yard and had his doubts.
“I’m sure,” he said, “ that the drop isn’t directly
under the beam, and that when the trap falls I’ll
hit the edge of the floor instead of dropping
through.” Marshall pulled his red beard for a
moment, then a bright thought struck him.
“Well,” he smiled, with the air of the bearer of
good tidings, “ all my other clients went through
the opening all right.”
Veteran Bonwick, industrious chronicler of
early Australian deeds and misdeeds, has dis-
covered, by his own solitary research on foot, the
obscure and forgotten graves of Hunter, King,
Bligh and Phillip, four of Botany Bay’s first
Governors. He found Hunter, King and Bligh’s
graves in cemeteries around London, and Phillip’s
in Bathampton cemetery, Bath. Some of these
discoveries involved years of plodding inquiry amd
tramping to and fro. Old man Bonwick has done
enormous service in the cause of Australian his-
tory and has been most miserably paid.
South Australia, besides its Tennyson, had
a Burns descendant, too. But the latter outlived
the new Gov.’s arrival only a few days. She was
a daughter of that only one of Bobbie’s family
who bore a close facial resemblance to the poet;
and the grand - daughter, who became Mrs.
McLellan, to some extent continued the likeness.
In certain other respects, however, there was
something of a difference between Robert and the
descendant; for she was “a valued member” of
the kirk, and several of her children—there are
nine of them living—sing, under the boss-ship of
one of them, in the local Scotch choir.
The only Hoolan (as reported by Northern
papers): “ I have my action with the Eagle
coming on. . I have instructed my solicitor at
Croydon to issue a writ for .£lOOO damages
against the Mining Standard for accusing me
of being ‘an informer ’ and a ‘Judas.’ After
these actions are over I shall make some other
paper sit up. If I fail in these actions I will know
that a paper can say what it likes about a politi-
cian without fear of consequences, and I will start
a paper in accordance with that idea.” Eminently
practical.
W. J. Horne, dead at Bibbenluke station
(N.S.W.), boxed the w'orld’s compass. Meant for
the English Church, he went off to sea ; sailed to
many parts ; struck Melbourne when the noise of
gold was in the air ; tickled Bendigo and Ballarat
with pick and shovel ; struck up to the Monaro
and founded Bibbenluke run ; raced for Queens-
land ; tramped the Palmer and Charters Towers
in their roaring days ; made money, lost it, many
times over; back to Bibbenluke once more, still
hunting treasure with avid heart. And then, out
there on the Monaro uplands, into his coffin at
80 years.
R.C. Archbishop O’Reily, who nearly made
the capitation-grant the live question at recent
S. A. Assembly election, is another instance of a
big and restless brain being encased in a weak
body. He is an excellent orator, and personally
most popular. When he ran a Northern S.A.
diocese he cleared every church within his boun-
daries of debt. He is now slowly accomplishing
the same feat in re the heavy R.C. Adelaide
Cathedral debt. “Bedad.” said an admiring
parishioner recently, “O'Reily has a heart in his
stomach as big as a wheelbarrow ! ” *
John Owen, who was an old identity of the
Lower Darling when Burke and Wills made
Menindie their depot, was found dead the other
morning just outside his holding. He was
manager of Tolarno, one of the best-known of
Western stations, 35 years ago. Old John kriew
most of the back-country pretty well up to the
Queensland border before Burke came, and made
numerous plans for his guidance—he reckoned
beforehand that they would be all wanted. By
the way, the Darling-side pub. where the ex-
plorers had their depot is still standing ; what
was their office is now a bedroom.

marked on M.L. Govt, sale map (8., 8/4/’99).
Taumata (brow of hill, or edge of cliff); haka
(dance); tangihana (sounding of an instrument,

terpretation : “The dance which took place on

which was accompanied by the playing of a

“A. A. A.”: Another aboriginal duck-
catching stratagem, formerly used about the
THE CAT FUNERAL.
A cat died in a house some time ago. There were six left. The children always had their dead pets buried-
in style—birds, cats, dogs, broken dolls, etc.
Ibis morning a slow procession of cats, yoked two abreast and black streamers hanging to their tails,
wound its way through the cabbages and pumpkin-vines to a remote corner of the garden where a grave was)
dug. Here it stopped ; and the mournful ceremony began. The eldest girl read •
Oh ! Lord o’ Love, look from above
Upon this poor dead cat,
Wot I ’ave fed an’ put ter bed
This three or four year back
The children here set up a dismal howl, and even the eats saw something pathetic in it, for they hung-
their heads and mewed mournfully.
At this juncture, Schneider (the house-dog) broke loose—jumped the garden fence, and cats were seen
stretching their legs to the utmost in all directions. Even the dead one got lip and ran. That house-dog
was a terror.

Myall. Darkie arranges large tuft of rough grass
or reeds on his head so as to completely conceal it
without preventing him from seeing around him.
Then gets into creek up to neck, and waits near
bank, whilst his companions gently “shoo” the
ducks towards the innocent-looking tuft, at which
they generally begin to pluck. No living being can
stand as motionless as an Aust. aboriginal, so
every now and again a duck is pulled under and
smothered. The others, imagining that their mate
has only dived, take no alarm. When enough
have been secured, the ducks are shooed further
along, so that they may not bo wiser next time,
and the catcher cautiously leaves the water with
his booty.

“ Pedagogue ” : Years ago, when a young-
ster, was appointed to half-time schools at Native
Dog and Bear Valley. After a lot of bumping
about with carpet-bag, I arrived at Bear Valley,
and was introduced to the secretary of Local
Board. The introducer took me aside afterwards
and warned me that the secretary was a Free-
thinker and no good. (The neighbors thereabouts
all seemed to have a bad opinion of each other,
and in general the bad opinion rested on a
good, solid basis). Next morning, when I
opened the school at Native Dog, I found an
anonymous letter under the door telling me
to keep an eye on the secretary, as he was a
specially virulent variety of atheist, and
would cub my throat if he got “ half a slant.”
Then there was calm, sweet peace for two
days, at the end of which I learned—per more
anonymous letter—that the storekeeper’s wife
wasn’t married to her alleged husband, and
that she was of illegitimate parentage. Within
the next week or so I heard, by similar sources,
that the publican had been in gaol, and that
a local young woman was a great deal worse
than she might be without hurting herself.
A month later I was informed that the secre-
tary had positively decided to cut my throat,
and had fixed the date, and that his frequent
visits to the school (ho was the only pleasant
visitor I had) were with a view to surveying
the lay of my jugular and deciding the best
place to stick the knife in before he dragged
it round. Being young and nervous, I left
then—my sudden departure was set down to
the fact that my former crimes had come to
light, and the police were after me—and went
to look for some place where anonymous letters
were less frequent. On applying at the Edu
cation Department for further employment,
was told that I should have stayed at the place I
had—stayed for £6O a year to have my throat cut
by the Department’s own secretary. That was a
good few years ago. The experience came back
to my mind because the one-time secretary cut his
own throat the other day—in fact, he nearly cut
his head off.

Told of a Nor’-western fossil that he was,
after many years, induced to visit a son-in-law at
Perth. It needed much persuasion to coax him
on board the steamer, and more to get him ashore
along the pier at Fremantle. Arrived on the
railway platform, he caught a terrifying glimpse
of a smoke-belching locomotive, and resolutely
jibbed. After a terrific struggle, his relatives got
him aboard by blindfolding him and pushing him
backwards into the carriage. He refused to
return, and is now resident with his son-in-law.
N.B.—This yarn may be told in public without
fear, except when said son-in-law is within ear-
shot.

In a New England tableland town was a
simple, good-natured old publican who used to be
a good deal victimised by cadgers and bogus
shearers at two-up and so forth. One of these
“mongers” once rang-in a bad half-sov. on “ Old
George,” and, even after he discovered the swindle,
another sharp got-at him with a miner’s right fora
pound-note, taking 19s. change. And, said 0.G.,
when he discovered this second “have”: “By
gum, if I’d-a know’d twus a bad poun’-ote, I’d-a

Here the ’roo does not
stand upright when
swimming. I have
seen ’roos and kanga-
roo-rats swimming,
and they take a posi-
tion in water similar to
that when going at

so, they keep only the
face and ears above
water and get along
faster than an ordin-

had, with her dog,
caught a native bear,
and had it killed,

“ Pedagogue Once, when skull-driving
out back, got two new boy-pupils, 11 or 12 years
old, who couldn’t articulate well enough to be
understood. Thought they were tongue-tied, and
called upon the mother (in a lonely gully) with a
view of having the matter attended to. Found
mother in a similar predicament, only a little
more so, and concluded that the boys had simply
imitated her, as she was about the only person
they ever heard try to talk. Alleged father, a
Dutchman, was splitting somewhere, and only
went home once a fortnight.

Chaff and molasses, well mixed, are being
used on some far north-west stations (N.S.W.) to
keep life in the sheep, where there isn’t any mulga

maize and sow it broadcast. Sheep are said to do
better on the corn.

loading gun with him, and the big
fellow told him he’d give him a pound
for a shot at him at 100yds. The d.b.
consented, and planted himself the
stipulated distance away, with his
hindermost part presented. The
squatter went on one Jknee, took de-
liberate aim, and'let her go, but,
though the shot peppered all round
the mark, the poor devil came out
scatheless. Then the squatter swore
horribly, paid the sov., and said,

“ A.H.T.” : Know a big Ameri-

Murray, a veritable giant, and splen-

the river townships used to get him—
when “doing time” —to cut up fire-
wood. When the nig. comes to the
township with a cheque, he first
walks to the police-station and peers
over the fence. If the wood-heap is
low, he shouldershis swag and moves
on to next township. If there is a
good stock he starts “on the burst,”
because he knows that, he being a
tough person to handle, they won’t
interfere with him unless hard-up for
wood.

and I “ sent him ”at it. When he came to corpse
he gave a leap, swung round, and got most of him
over the bridge-railing. Railing held until we

M’Cooey on blackfellow’s natural-history
lore
The Australian “ blackpheller ” used to be regarded by
bushmen as an infallible authority on all questions of
Australian natural history. Even such an able scientist
as the late Dr. Bennett clung with firm faith to the
blackpheller’s ipse dixit. Said b.f., however, is justly re-
garded as quite unreliable in this direction. He has dis-
covered amongst the flora and fauna of Australia every-
thing good for his pumpkin-shaped bingie ; but about the
life-history or habits of the animals he daily devours he
knows little and cares less. He still believes that the
platypus brings forth its young alive, and when, 14
years ago, I discovered, at Coonanible, N.S.W.,
that the echidna (porcupine ant-eater) laid eggs
and hatched them in its pouch, the local b.f.
regarded me as a harmless species of idiot.
Still, our dusky friend has made o?ie useful discovery (all
alonga bingie, of course!). He has found that the gum
of a certain wattle-tree (A. decurrens) is an almost in-
fallible cure for ordinary dysentery, than which no dis-
ease was more fatal to the aborigines. In fact, but for
tfii3 discovery Capt. Cook would have met very few of
them when he struck Port Jackson. For 30 years I have
seen this guru used for dysentery, and have rarely or ever
known it fail to cure. “ Eucalyptus” Bosisto well knew
this gum’s therapeutic value, but, as he couldn’t make it,
he kept dark on the point. The gum may be eaten raw,
but is better gently stewed for a few minutes in milk. It
may be gathered at any time, and will keep for years in
a tin.

“ Mac.” re aboriginal foods :
Nothing new in the announcement that goanna is good
eating. Most practical bushmen have tasted it. When a
boy, I delighted to steal off to the blacks’ camp and feast
on roast goanna and snake, to the delight of the blacks,
who love to see their food relished by a white. I very
often even now cook and eat goanna. Cook in hot ashes,
damper fashion, leaving on the skin, which will in due
course peel off, exposing the snow-white, flaky flesh ; the
ofteneryou eat which the oftener you want to. All the
rat-kangaroos, many of our opossums, and almost all
Australian birds are excellent eating. Perameles lagotus
(a species of bandicoot) was recommended by Gould, the
ornithologist, for domestication in England as an edible
animal.

“ H.M.” : Any of your readers know
what is the meaning of scars so common with
N.S.W. bla'ck-gins on middle of upper left arm,
cut both vertically and transversely, and covering
an area of about 2in.x2in ? The gins themselves
cannot be induced to reveal the meaning of this
scarification. They simply look at each other and
laugh. Only once did I get a hint on the subject.
Asking a 15-year-old damsel (who seemed to re-
joice in the recently-inflicted wounds) about it, her
old mother, who was in a joyous state of ruin,
said, “ Oh, dat pheller ” (the young gin), “ him
s<son get plenty pheller husband now.” _ I am in-
clined from this to deduce that the scarification is,
so to say, an advt. of arrival at puberty.

A bush authority dogmatises. Also, he
pigmatises:—
Oil is useless in snakebite, and nicotine is (like soap-
suds, salt, mustard, etc.) of use in strychnine-poisoning
only as an emetic. Pigs are difficult to poison, for the
simple reason that they very often vomit the poisoned
food before the poison has got hold of the system. Also,
difficult to kill with snakebite, because it is not easy for
the snake to inflict a deadly bite through a pig’s skin,
except on flanks, lips and inside of legs. Dogs are very
susceptible to snake-poison, and birds are quickly killed

with a very little of it. There’s no cure for snakeb te,
once a lethal dose has got into the system. Prof. Martin s
(Sydney University) experiments havc.completUydis-
proved the efficacy of the late Dr. Mueller sstrychn -
treatment. Strychnine greatly injures the walls Of
the nerve - tubes and blood - vessels through which
it passes, actually doing thus more physiological
damage than snake - poison itself. Have myself
exhaustively tested the strychnine - treatment in
cases of poisoning by all kinds of snakes in all
kinds of subjects (bar human) and have never once
observed any benefit from it. The only infallible protec-
tion against snakebite is immunisation by inject ions of
the poison itself or of serum taken from a subject so
treated. As to the oil-cure, I’ve butchered many jackals
of science in my time, but I’m still eager for scalps, and
I’m reaching out with both hands for “ Tin Lip s. ’

close to the hearts of Australian poetry-lovers.

The Commercial World (London) writes re-
garding the Colonial Mutual Life Assurance Society :
“ We always confidently anticipate a good year from"this
vigorously-conducted Mutual Society. The circumstance,
therefore, that the fisrures for 1897 show no falling away
from the steady and substantial progress which is inse-
parably connected with the Society’s past career occasions
us no surprise. As a matter of fact, the Society earns its
success by deserving it, and, that much being conceded,
the best possible has been said for the continuance of the
large measure of public support which it has hitherto
fallen to its fortunate lot to receive.” Pleasant reading.*

The annual report of the Royal Humane
Society of Australasia shows two striking items :
“Secretary’s salary, <£2so ; life-buoys, <£27 145.”
Artist Gordon Coutts.
Artist Gordon Goutts, a young painter ««no ha»
not yet seen his 30th birthday, sails shortly for
England, after 11 years’ sojourn in Aus-
tralia, of which period eight years were
spent in Melbourne, and three in Sydney.
Herewith is given a portrait of the
artist, and a reproduction of a note-
worthy picture from his studio, “ Too
Late,” shown in Sydney at N.S.W. Art
Society’s Exhibition of ’95. Mr. Coutts
was then in Melbourne, and the encomias-
tic criticism called forth by this picture
decided him to take up his residence and
venture his fortunes in Sydney. He sub-
sequently became art-instructor to the
Society’s classes, a position which he has
but lately resigned. That his relations
with the students have been most friendly
is evidenced by the warmth of their fare-
well. At his studio, 26 Hunter-street, Mr.
Coutts has been giving a final exhi-
bition of his work in oils and water-colors
—some hundred or more subjects ; and
connoisseurs should remember that there
is here an opportunity to purchase.
Among the most distinctive of the oils
is a fine picture of half-lights and sub-
dued shadow's entitled “ A Song at
Twilight.” This is the piece dc resist-
ance of the gallery. Another somewhat
impressionist picture the eye delights to
dw'ell on, is also a “Twilight”—a land-
scape. “ Bay view,” “McMahon’s Point,”
“ After Years of Toil,” “ Once a Gentle-
man ” (the two just named fine charac-
ter studies), “The Cook’s Galley,” “A
Bacchante,” “ Summer Sun*” “Harvest
Time.” and “The Coming Storm” aro
all pictures the writer would like to
possess—and some of them are not among
the highest-priced, either. There are a
score or so of water-color drawings, many
of them very picturesque reproduc-
tions of some of the most alluring of
Sydney’s beauty - spots. A delightful
water - color is “ Outward - Bound.”
Mr. Coufcts is credited with being the most
bashful artist south of the Line. He is also
said to have made the shortest speech on record,
when the Art Society formed itself into a conver-
sazione, in order to present him with a gold watch.
The modest artist, taken entirely by surprise,
simply remarked that he would much rather paint
a picture than make a speech, seized the watch,
and hurriedly retired to hide his blushing per-
sonality among the crowd.

A stronger aroma of' —well, call it romance,

claims upon feminine interest—especially in view
of the rumor that he is firmly attached to a girl
of humble degree, whom he is having prepared to
take her place as his wife ? The photograph here-

The Finest Site.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Four Bush Politicians weird,
Touzle-haired and rough of beard,
In a Sydney bar-room sat,
Talking there of this and that,
Till at last the talk did fall
On the Federal Capital.
Said Politician Number One —
“ If a thing is to be done,
What I say is—Do it through !
Make the site my little borough.”
“ What borough?’
“ Murrum-burrah !
That’s the finest site of all
For the Fed’ral Capital.”
Said Politician Number Two—
“ Blanky rot! My town’s the true
Site, as anyone can tell.
She’s the daisy ! She’s- the belle ! ”
“What belle?”
“ Nimity-belle !

“Pickle Bottle”: “Did you notice that inci-

Some individual, having 100 sovereigns, kept them in his

abnormal sense of smell, scented the pickle-bottle, and
in the stilly night removed it. One more example of
rhan’s foolishness. If the owner of the pickle-bottle had
only placed it in the Sydney Safe Deposit in Ash-street,
at the back of Paling's, it would have been beyond the
scent and reach of even the smartest cracksman, and he
would still have his 100 sovs.*
It takes a bard to catch a bard ; and E. J.
Brady claims to have caught the popular Newbolt
tripping when he wrote that
Drake, he’s in his hammock and a thousand feet below
Brady points out that Drake was not thrust over-
board in the usual sailor-fashion, but was coffined
in lead that he might be better preserved to fight
Spaniards at the Day of Judgment. But
surely the lead coffin does not exclude the ham-
mock? Anyway, Newbolt is welcome to pick
holes in Brady’s just-published collection of verses,
“The Ways of Many Waters,” and a copy has
been sent him to that end and others more com-
plimentary. The price of “The Ways” is 55.,

Poet Ogilvie lias a practical horse-side as
well as a poetical, and when he was handling “a
young one” the other day it fell and rolled on
him, hurting his shoulder to some extent. The

The Bulletin. Ogilvie’s charming book of
“ Fair Girls and Gray Horses ” continues to sell
as well as it deserves—that is to say, splendidly.

A correspondent :
Dear Bulletin. — Re your recent just remarks about
the Sirdar and the Mahdi’s corpse, how different
the conduct of Emperor Charles V. After Luther was
dead, and there had gathered about his name the
hate men feel for an enemy who has been too strong for
them, Charles happened to come to Wittenberg; and,
when conducted, at his own request, to the arch-heretic's
tomb, stood gazingat it, full of many thoughts, until it
was suggested that the body should be taken up and
burnt at the stake in the market-place. It was then, the
common practice of the Church thus to serve the remains
of heretics, and there was probably not another Catholic
prince who would have hesitated to comply. But Charles
said only : “ I war not with the dead.”
THE AUSTRALIAN GEM TRADE.
H. Newman, the well-known jeweller of 175
Elizabeth-street, Melbourne, is the largest buyer
of opal in Australia, and opal miners will find it
to their advantage to send their opal direct to
him. The firm has a reputation for straight deal-
ing extending over a period of 40 years, which is
a sufficient guarantee to consignors that they will
be honorably treated. H. Newman is also a
buyer of all other Australian gems. *
A correspondent to The Bulletin from
Manila;—
Manila is just now a city of the dead. After 7 p.m.
the military compel everyone except soldiers to be in
their houses, and this most brilliantly-lighted City of the
Orient—there is electric-light everywhere—is as silent as
the grave, save for occasional sounds of distant firing
from the trenches. Warren’s Circus cleared. They are
doing good biz. at Hongkong, but lost considerably here.
Dr. Harley (who was laid up in Sydney last July and
Aug.) occupies the Teatro Filipino with his magical, &c.,
entertainments. He can only play afternoons, and while
things are so disturbed that is hardly worth doing. The
sensational washing-out gold was a hoax. There is, no
doubt, plenty gold in the Islands, but way-back in at
present inaccessible country. A number of miners are
waiting over, but I fancy they wish they had not been so
previous, as it will probably be years ere any advance
can be made. The interior is very mountainous
and inhabited by fierce tribes, and some other gold-
bearing islands by fanatic Mahommedans. This place has
no doubt a future, but it is remote. For ordinary trades
and callings there is absolutely nothing to do, and men
would find it impossible to get a job. The authorities
are making things hot in many ways, and the burdens of
the taxpayers are unbearable. The Spaniard has his
tongue in his cheek, and smiles at the “ liberty ” the
Yankee authorities allow to the peaceable inhabitants of
the Philippines. Doubtless when Civil authorities are
appointed and things simmer down matters may improve
—there is vast room for it. You cannot get much news
from the outer world. The- press pays for cables, but
little is published. And as the press is gagged, the
straight tip for miners and workers is—“ Don’t come;
but, if you do, don’t hurry.” ’ '

SPORTING NOTIONS.
“ N.Q.” : “ Tatt.’s ” announcement that he will
not advise any drawer of a horse in his sweeps unless
ticket-holder wires him prepaid, giving him No. of ticket,
when he will reply Yes or No, is extra-rough on way-back
speculators who help to swell his coffers. Fancy me,
2000 miles off, drawing (say) Bobadil for Sydney Cup (2
to 1 against for a week and then scratched) ; why should
I pay Bs. or 10s. for a wire on the off-chance, whilst a
resident of Hobart gets his good or bad news in time to
lay-off in such a case ? I wrote to “ Tatt. ” instructing
him to send a wire at any time if I had the luck to get a
probable starter. I would chance the blackmailing,'but
it is no go. Either draw all sweeps on day of race, and
make it an absolutely even gamble, or else give outsiders
a show to hedge, not part. If a man in the eastern pro-
vinces draws Bobadil, or any other hot favorite scratched
at the eleventh hour, thus getting non-starter’s pittance
instead of a snug sum from hedging, this will strike like
a blow from Samson.

Dear Bulletin. Re “ Tattersall’s ” sweeps.
“ Tatt.” has agents in different centres. There is one in
Newcastle and one in Sydney. I know, because I have
got tickets in both places, and hope to get more. Sup-
pose 1 to 1000 are for sale at Newcastle, 1001 to 2000 at
Brisbane, and so on. When the sweep closes, I presume
the agents notify “ Tatt.” as to number of tickets sold.
Suppose Newcastle and Brisbane each sell 600, they have
each 400 unsold. The sweep closes with 10,0 )0 subs.
Are marbles 1 to 10,000 placed in the barrel? If so, what
about the 800 tickets unsold in Newcastle and Brisbane?
I believe Adams is square. I have subscribed for years,
and am still doing so, but I should certainly like to know
how this part of the drawing is arranged. It was simple
enough when all the tickets were issued from one place,
but, when sold in different places, what is the system ?
Snakejuice.
* • * *
Editor Bulletin.—Sir. —“ Tattersall ” has been
publishing some information as to his methods of drawing
sweeps, but there are other questions of equal importance
which are seemingly disregarded. It has been noticed by
myself and friends that the special on Sydney Cup was
by no means extensively advertised. I have been a sub-
scriber to “ Tattersall ” for a good many years, yet on
my posting application for shares in Sydney Cup from,
Melbourne on 15th March I was surprised that my first
number (and they run consecutively) was only 313, and
that on such an important race (my shares were in No. 1
25,000) the sweep closed with only 10,000 subscribers.
Inference I will leave to all intelligent persons.—A Sub-
scriber. [What inference ?—Ed. B.]
• * * *
Re Ogilvie’s “Fair Girls and Gray Horses”:
London Sporting Times declares that it needs courage to
back a grey horse to win the Derby, seeing that from the
days of Diomed until now it has been won but once by a
horse of that color. The Seois Greys, says the authority,
would do badly if they had to look for thoroughbreds to
mount them. Singularly enough, however, when a grey
horse is found, and he is at all a good one, he is invari-
ably popular, even more so than other horses that are
possibly superior to him. Little Gimcrack is instanced,
whose fame is celebrated every year ; and, strange to say,
he is the only animal that is so celebrated, although his
reputation is nothing like that of Eclipse—yet nobody
ever dreams of giving an Eclipse, or a West Australian,
or an Isonomy dinner. Gimcrack, by the way, when in
training was nearly black. When he left the turf he
became quite white. There would seem to be a kind of
fetich about the grey horse—as there is about the red-
headed girl.
* * * *
Re difference between starting prices as quoted
in Sydney dailies, and what could have been actually
obtained on course. Writer knows that most turf scribes
make inquiries of one particular bookie, and as a good
number of the strident-voiced are interested in the city
shops where S.P. betting is indulged in considerably,
they are not lik*l*» to over"'® the quotations.
J • h * * •
“ Bargo” t What bookioaking has come to. At
recent Randwick meet had with me a man who was owed
£4 by a “ Rocks” booky over a bike-meeting a fortnight
before. Found him betting “ scrums ” and “ zacs,” and
he asked friend to wait till the Final Handicap was run.
Did so, and when result was known bookie remarked :
“ Well, I’m hanged 1 38 bob in the bag, and that takes 19
out.” Not being able to stump up, he took my man for a
drink, and on the way was accosted by a bleary-eyed
bummer who demanded his 3d. back because he had
backed a scratched horse in the last race. “ For Gord’s
sake, give it back, Oxy,” he said, “ I’m dyin’ for a beer,”
and “Oxy,” cursing, returned the money.
• * * •
Tlio one thing needed to make the starting-
machine a great success is a steward to be stationed some
30 yards, or so, from the post, for noting the loafers.
Under the old flag system a non-trier easily succeeded in
getting a bad start without making his intention quite
obvious. The machine, as often as not, gives a good start
for them all, yet it undoubtedly tends to make bad luck
for some of the triers. Some horses that are not “ on the
job ” may get a little in front of the genuine candidates,
and, as their riders immediately begin to take th n;s
easily, the unfortunates in the rear are badly blocked.
Under the gate-system, the trier that isn’t one of the
quickest off the mark has a worse chance than it would
get if the field were “ despatched in rather straggling
order” by means of the flag, for then the “st.iff-’uns”
would mostly fail to get away, leaving the eager ones to
enjoy a fair fight among themselves. Granting that the
machine compels a somewhat level start, and saves a
good deal of irritating delay at the post, what can pun-
ters gain by the “improvement” as long as the practice
of early pulling, which amounts to blocking, is allowed to
go on unchecked ? It merely adds to the glorious uncer-
tainty, and plays into the hands of Ikey Mo.
* * * *
A common dodge of “ fly ” punters in Tasmania
is, when the tote-tickets are ss. each, during the rush for
tickets just prior to a race, to put down a two-shilling
piece covered by a half-crown, and thus beat the club for
sixpence.
• * • •
The practice adopted by M.L. trotting stewards
of putting up a rider of their own in a subsequent race
on a trotter whom they suspect as a non-trier earlier
in the day does not always turn out well (says a Bulletin
correspondent). Some horses, accustomed to the same
trainer and rider, know immediately when a fresh hand
takes the reins, and act accordingly. They may shape
far better than when sent along under their own mentor.
But the latter always has the best of it because he and
his horse understand each other, while the new-chum,
put up by the club, is, in many cases, at loggerheads with
his charge. A case in Southern M.L., the other day : A
hot favorite went down in a mile trot, cut out in a cer-
tain time. The dissatisfied stewards put up a man of
their own in the next mile ; result, less satisfaction. Then
they were satisfied.
* * * *
An M.L. trotting-yarn to hand shows how
clever some M.L. stewards are at detection of
“ ringers.” An owner of two horses, one good, another
indifferent, wired to a well-known driver to steer them
on the morrow, and to meet train that night and stable
them—sender would arrive in morning. Something
occurred, and owner didn't reach racecourse until after
first event, which his horse had won. Astonished, h ■
asked, “ How did hs win?” “Oh, anyhow.” “But”
(noticing sweat on the good horse) “ tell me, which horse
did you start ?” “ Why, this cove.” “ Oh 1 for heaven’s
sake cover ’em up, arid let’s get off the course ; he was
never entered for the race.”
* * * •
Nemesis? Whispered that while an artistic
manipulator of crorrk ’tins was painting an intended
“ringer,” the indignant neddy launched out and sent
the bushman to hospital with a broken leg.
Melbourne has tbe new woman of the turf. She
trains, rubs down, saddles, unsaddles, and leads to the
course her own ponies. Some early morning touts aver
that this Australian “ Mr. Jersey ” frequently rides the
gee-gees in their work— wearing bivechesand-boots the
while.

He the “ no money ” labelled-dang u-ous section
of the leather-lunged. Writer was much amused at one
bookie going about at Flemington 'last Newmarket-day
w’ith a big card in front of his hat bearing the legend,
“ No money North British or Hvmettus ’’—pretty well the
only two horses enquired for. The card part of the busi-
ness calls to mind a happening of some years back, when
Billy Lees (since dead) fust started betting- in Randwiek
paddock. A layer of odds in the Leger reserve had the
upper part ol' his body sandwiched between two cards
which conveyed the information that he was “guaranteed
by Billy Lees.”
* * * *
The races were just over at Cow Flat, and
Harry the Greaser had won a Flying Handicap with a
half-Arab mare, beating, amongst others, a horse belong-
ing to Yellow Bill, a Eurasian. “ Bet you a level tenner
1 beat your mare to-morrow,” said Yellow Bill to Harry.
“ Done !” was. the reply ; “owners up.” “Yes,” said the
Eurasian, “ but -no start, no race.” But when, early
next morning, Harry went to the pub.-yard to feed hfs
mare, he found her dead-lame—both fore-hoofs rasped to
bleeding-point. “ Here’s a go,” said Harry to his friends.
“Some scab has rasped the mare's feet so she can
hardly stand.” His friends cursed liberally, but said
their money was on her and she’d have to go for it.
Harry saw no help for it unless he meant to pay up the
tenner, so at the appointed time the two starters came to
the post, and the mare’s backers looked glum at the way
she hobbled. But, to their intense surprise, she never
lost the horse very far, and in the end beat him cleverly
by a head. “ That yaller rascal’s money saved his skin !”
commented Harry, “ but you don’t catch me takin’ no
more chances with mongrel niggers 1 ”
* * * *
The Bulletin just now is not taking any yarns
re the in-and-out running of bicycle “champions.” For
one thing, the young men with the nubbly legs and im-
movable cast of countenance are not interesting to the
public at large ; and, in the next place, their perform-
ances are not “ scandalous.” The wail of the punter who
has put his eighteenpence on the wrong champion doesn’t
reach this journal’s heart. Bike-racing is much more
satisfactory than horse-racing, as regards “ form.” The
half-dozen men who took the prizes in scratch-races
last year are repeating their profits this season—lump
them together, regard them as one man instead of six,
and their “form” is quite satisfactory. When does a
rank outsider defeat the clique of “ cracks ” ?
Horse-racing swindles at the minor meets are
likewise outside the pale of Bulletin indignation. People
don’t go to such places for sport; their object is to be
“in the know” oftener than they are out of it, and the
best way of achieving the object is to get appointed to a
stewardship of the meeting.

A Yic. hotel-keeper was not long ago “reported”
to the L.Y.W. for having charged two biking tourists 10s.
for dinner. On investigation it appeared that the vora-
cious youths had disposed of one turkey, major portion of
sirloin, much cheese, more beer, bottie of claret, fruit,
and various large helpings of sweets. It was indigestion
that caused them to quarrel with the bill.

caused me to
think my illness

unbearable pains in the back and abdomen
would assail ine. At length I visited Lake Mac-
quarie for change of air, but was forced to return
to my home through my illness. An advertise-
ment which appeared in the Newcastle Herald
induced me to try Bile Beans. I thought they
might do my liver good. Although the first dose
had a rather powerful effect, I felt some little
benefit. I accordingly decreased the dose, but
continued with the Beans, and in a week’s time I
felt much better. Now lam able to eat and sleep
well, have no sick headaches, and, in fact, life is a
pleasure to me. lam never troubled with lan-
guor, and am regaining my lost weight. I am
recommending the Beans to my friends, as I am
sure they alone cured me. ”
Why are Bile Beans the Most
Popular Medicine Sold in
Australia To-day?
At the outset, this appears a puzzling question
to answer. That it is a big statement to make in
view of the large number of medicines advertised,
we admit. That it is a true statement thousands
of Australian men and women admit, and the
truth and justice of their admission are supported
by the following facts -Because during the first
six months following the introduction of Bile Beans
to the Australian public, eight million doses were
consumed. Because during the next succeeding
six months, no less than twenty-two million doses
were consumed. Because, during the year ending
February 28, 1899, thirty million doses were con-
sumed. Because the following enormous orders, un-
dying testimonials to the continuance and increase
of Bile Beans in public favor, have been given by
Australasian firms and executed by the Bile Bean
Manufacturing Company Rocke, Tompsitt and

SYDNEY, N.S.W.
Dear Sirs,
After giving the matter full consideration, we have decided
to accept your terms for the Sole Agency for Bile Beans for the
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, namely, an initial
purchase of £20,000 worth.
This is, of course, an exceptionally large order for one
patent medicine—we doubt if it has ever been exceeded in the
world—and it evidences our faith in the future prospects of the
medicine in the much larger field to which it is now about to be
introduced.
This faith is, however, justified by the marvellous success
of the article in this colony, and its sales have certainly ex-
ceeded in quantity those of any other medicine we have handled,
and our most sanguine expectations.
Yours faithfully,
bourne. Because testimonials are being received
almost daily from grateful persons who have
been cured by Bile Beans of long-standing mala-
dies. Because the worth of Bile Beans is
proved by the marvellous cures which they have
at times effected in spite of overwhelming odds.
Because Bile Beans are sold at a popular price,
and one which places them within the reach of all
—the opulent and needy alike. Because the Bile
Bean formula is not a carelessly prepared one, but
is the result of years of patient research on the
part of an American medical man, who discovered
a vegetable substance which, when compounded
with other ingredients, produced an effect on the
human digestive organism identical with that of
the natural bile created by the liver. Because
Bile Beans have rendered the old methods of
starving and the use of pepsin and bismuth wholly
unnecessary. Because Bile Beans do not, like
nearly all laxative remedies sold to-day, act in a
violent manner and weaken the patient, but
act on the bowels gently and in a soothing
manner. Because Bile Beans are manufac-
tured in possibly the best equipped labora-
tory in the world, at Detroit, Michigan, U.S.A.,
where only the best and most approved methods
are adopted and ingredients used. Because Bile
Beans have been manufactured with the especial
object of assisting the digestive organs in the pro-
per and thorough discharge of their natural func-
tions, and because Bile Beans do this in a safe and
reliable manner. Because Bile Beans do not, like
many alleged remedies, cure broken limbs and
such misfortunes, but because they do what is
claimed for them, cure all illnesses arising from
impaired digestive organs, liver, stomach, and kid-
neys. Because the Australian public, having
recognised the worth of Bile Beans, has cast aside
all other remedies, and universally taken to
8.85., the greatest medical discovery of
the nineteenth century. Because Bile Beans
are sold by all storekeepers, chemists and
druggists throughout the Australasian colonies, and
because Bile Beans are an undoubted specific for
billiousness, sick and nervous headache, indiges-
tion, constipation, piles, female weakness, pale-
faced girls, irregularities, bad breath, blotches,
pimples, dizziness, all liver and kidney troubles,
dyspepsia, heart palpitation, pain in back and
sides, fulness after eating, lack of physical
tone, heartburn, and that tired feeling. Ob-
tainable from all chemists and storekeepers,
price Is. per large box, or from
the Australian depot, 39 Pitt-street, Sydney.
Bile Beans come within the reach of all, and at
the low price they are sold at no one should be
without a box.

POLITICAL
POINTS
On dit that the next N.S.W. Attorney-
(■eneral will be the present acting one, G. 11.
who will keen the Premiership, but find a
new treasurer.
Problem for consideration : Had John
Haynes been taken into the Reid Ministry, would
he now resign his portfolio because he doesn't like
the Federal Enabling Eill ?
P- R- Wise: “The truth, as Dr. Mac-
Laurin’s Finance Committee had to admit, is that
union will not cost N.S. Wales more (at the most)
than 3s. 6d. per. head, which is, as Mr. R, E.
O'Connor said, just one shilling more than it costs
to register a dog.”
The Tas. West coast districts contain up-
wards of 12,000 adult males, yet owing to the
state of the electoral law in the Isle of Bad
Dreams only 435 votes were recorded for the
recent Lyell election for the Assembly. For the
Lpg. Council seat for the same electorate 126
voted 1
JUSTIFIED.
BLANKY : “Spot the side that J.P’s puttin' on
—it fair turns me sick."
SLANKY : "Oh! well, I s’pose he'll 'ave a bigger
funeral than me or you will.”
“The R.C. Church in Victoria is building
schools with great energy, and the time is not far
distant when every R.C.’s children must attend
their own school,’ or take the consequences ”
writes a Bulletin correspondent. “One R.C.
church in Brunswick has struck a levy, and every
man, woman and child must pay to the building-
fund—adults from 20s. a year, children 55.”
The anti-Federalists think they are making
the most of the fact that the present N.S.W.
Premier says he expects to be “ sent for ” by the
Govern or-General to form the first Australian
Federal Ministry, by imputing to him self-interest
in rc his advocacy of the Enabling Bill. Well, if
the N.S.W. Premier is to head the Common-
wealth’s first Ministry, what will N.S.W. have to
growl about ?
The most populous electoral division in
South Australia is E. Torrens, which comprises
the eastern suburbs of Adelaide. It contains
7764 male and 7197 female voters, and returns two
members. Encounter Bay, where the O'Malley
hails from, returns two members also, but it has
only 2355 electors, of whom 1126 are women.
Altogether there are 82,862 men and 68,253 women
on the S.A. rolls.
The fact that Want isn’t coming out
to head the Geebung party, the inadequacy of
MacLaurin, the unpopularity of Dibbs, and the
reticence of Lyne, leaves the leadership of the
Cabba,ge-tree Mob to a miscellaneous crowd of
undesirables. Which position of affairs has given
occasion to a gibe by Barton, to the effect that the
only leaders of the anti-Bill crowd are the leaders
in Sydney Daily Telegraph.
When the N.S.W. Executive consisted of
only six members, one was. A ttorney-General. and
another Solicitor-General. Now the province has
no Attorney-General, and it is intimated that such
an official can be very well done without for some
time. Its nominal Solicitor-General has gone
abroad, leaving G. C. Wade, a mere handy law-
yer, without political or parliamentary experience,
to fulfil the duties of both Attorney and Solicitor-
General.
What a contrast between the brilliant,
dashing, effective fight made by S.M. Herald for
the bill at last referendum, and the tame, prosy,
sleepy, apologetic, advocacy at present. If, in the
contest for supremacy now being waged between
the Telegraph and Herald the latter is crippled
—as seems not unlikely—there is only one thin"
for it: a Federal daily paper which will have fixed
principles and a bright and interesting way of
presenting them. O, for the day !
There have been such extraordinary “ turn-
abouts ” over the Federal Eill that, now that the
Reid and Barton parties have coalesced for the
referendum-fight, great care will have to be exer-
cised in sending speakers out. For instance,
Argyle and the Hawkesbury were turned against
the Bill by barrister Rose ; Goulburn by Ashton,
M. ; King Division by Reid. These gentlemen,
who supplied the poison, ought to be sent to pro-
vide an antidote —as an expiation.
Teetotaller Cook, in accepting the office of
N. Minister of Mines, thought he had found
his element. But in N.S.W., Agriculture goes
(stupidly enough) with Mines. Hence Mr. Cook
has to admit in one day the moral justice of grant-
ing cash compensation to vignerons whose phyl-
loxera-tainted wine-vines the State uproots, and
to put a good face upon the assertion that his con-
science revolts against compensating publicans in
the event of State liquor-prohibition becoming
law.
No false modesty in Tas. Upper House
candidates. One of them, in his published address
to the electors :
Being interested in Real Estate in this colony, I am
specially desirous of its welfare, and should be opposed to
all arbitrary or fanciful changes in taxation.
Just so. Some {£8,000,000 worth of unearned
values, which have been grabbed by fewer than
5000 Tas. landlords, is practically untaxed, and
85 per cent, of the revenue is raised through
customs.
Even Sydney D.T., with one eye (the
right) persistently closed against true federal
feeling, publishes wires from the country saying
that the general idea is that no opposition would
confront the Constitution Bill if Sydney were
made the capital. But that is the sentiment to
kill the “ Colonists’” League of the D.T. Once
the country denizens get the impression that they
are to'be used as catspavvs (which they will be
now if not careful) they will fight tooth and nail
against the greedy commercial spielers of the
metropolis.
Mildura, which lately voted a second time
for municipally-owned pubs., has drafted its
scheme and sent it on to Vic. Premier Turner,
who is asked to submit it to Parliament in the
form of an Amending Licensing Bill. The pro-
posal is that the local shire council shall appoint
the committee of management from its own mem-
bers ; net profits to be divided between charities
(including a hospital) and the local shire council
and irrigation trust. Charities, it is suggested,
shall have first call ; and it is not proposed to fix
the percentage to be paid away in that direction.
Andy Dawson, the favorite member of Q.
Parliamentary Labor-party, has po reason to com-
plain of his political lot. Three years ago this
popular and brainy Laborist received .£3OO from
his Charters Towers admirers ; some months later
he vvas appointed to a Royal Commission and
obtained .£5OO for his services, and a fortnight
ago the generous electors of the premier Q. gold-
field again handed their member a purse contain-
ing .£lOO. Net income for three years—.£9oo par-
liamentary screw,£soo froir
Commission, and £4OO from
constituents—.£lBoo. Daw-
son, however, disburses his
lucre with a royal reckless-
ness. Anyhow, if you want
to keep your capable Demo-
crats straight, pay them
well. They can “resist any-
thing but temptation.”
A HYDE PARK
SOLILOQUY .
MR. HARDUP: “ Yes,
it’s a beautiful 'arbor, Capting; but how
about the unemployed?"
A wire from Perth, W.A., last Thursday,
announced a startlingly satisfactory test of the
local coal in a steamer-trip to Wyndham and
back. Also, the feature of the recent Melb. eight-
hour procession was the trophy exhibiting the
progress of the Gippsland coal-mines. Signs like
these should make N.S.W. coal-miners, and those
interested in coal-production, take a keen interest
in the passage of the Federal Bill. Newcastle and
Bulli would look pretty sick if Sydney Datly
Telegraph’s visionary bounties became actualities,
a fear which would for ever be annihilated by
interprovincial freetrade.
The average newspaper-report of a political
meeting, or a sitting of Parliament, conveys ab-
solutely no idea of what really happens. Sydney
Dau.y Telegraph’s report of the Mittagong
speech suppresses all real mention of Premier
Reid’s convincing indictment of that paper’s
crookedness ; and S.M. Herald, fearful of
advertising its rival, omits that part of the
Premier’s speech. Newspapers are mere soul-
AT THE
ASYLUM.
VISITOR : “ What
is that poor man's
delusion?”
WARDER: “ Well, he
imagines he sees a Chow and a policeman together,
and he can’t make up his mind which to shot the
stone at. He’s a had case.”
less commercial concerns, alleesame grocery-shop.
London Times is the only newspaper in the world
which dares to be tolerably honest. The Times is
some sort of a record ; the rest of the papers are
delusions.
S.M. Herald is in some respects so
beastly truthful just now that The Bul-
letin begins to smell rats in its ponderous
contemporary’s Federal advocacy. For instance,
Sydney D.T. says that at a suburban meet-
ing addressed by Haynes, or Kohen, or some-
body, an anti-Federal-bill resolution was carried
“ with only three dissentients and the Herald
report says exactly ditto. This kind of thing is
unprecedented so far as the present scribe, erst-
while a shorthander, knows. It is his experience
that no daily paper that was really in earnest ever
jibbed at telling lies. But then he has never been
“ on ” S.M. Herald.
The result of the S.A. elections, so far as
known, shows that the Kingston Ministry will
go back to power at least as strong as formerly. All
the Ministers have been returned. Priestly inter-
ference in the contest failed, and Kingston and
Batchelor were returned for West Adelaide.
Editor Denny, R.C. Archbishop O’Reily’s
nominee, was beaten in his attempt to bring
about a state of things under which Protestanb
and Catholic, Jew and Gentile children should nob
sit on the same forms and play in the same play-
grounds. The double referendum was answered
in favor of Federation and in favor of the Leg.
Council suffrage —both planks in the Govt, plat-
form. South Australia could hardly have done
better.
The perennial controversy on the advis-
ableness of Opposition unity in Q. is now ragingin
the local democratic press. Progress, represent-
ing the moderates, goes the whole independent
hog.by suggesting the abandonment of the name
“ Labor ” on the ground that “ it never met a man
who was fond of the thing itself, and the word as
a talisman has lost its charm.” Wallace Nelson,
barracking on the Labor-ticket, describes Pro-
gress’ advice as “inciting to suicide,” and
vehemently thunders for the solidarity of the
Labor-party. Worker, and other Socialistic
organs, while favoring an elastic Opposition com-
bination, deprecate anything like fusion or re-
linquishment of a Solidarity Labor plank. What
the Parliamentary reps, have to say remains to be
heard, but the chances of amicable arrangement
seem more favorable than at any other time since
the coalition. And the new Labor blood is much
richer than the old.
The announcement of books by Le Gal-
lienne and several others on Rudyard Kipling
shows how eagerly the writing-ghouls were on the
track of the almost moribund. Kipling’s recovery
was similarly followed in more than one Austra-
lian paper by columns of biographical stuff ob-
viously written and set-up in readiness for the
death that never occurred.
Federation—yes or no. Has Germany to
have Samoa with Mataafa as king—or shall we
Federate with America? Malietoa Tanu would
be happy if he knew a shipment of “Zetz” Spa
Water has been specially ordered for the fleet—
who all say “ Zetz ” is the correct water to mix
with any stimulant, or drink by itself. “Zetz”
kills uric acid, aids digestion, and is nature’s
true regulator. The password for good health
is “Zetz.” Plump for “Zetz.”*
All material used in the manufacture of
Massey-Harris bicycles is minutely examined on
its entrance to the factories at Toronto, Canada,
and any portion of it that fails to answer the
searching test placed on it by the mechanical ex-
perts, employed for this purpose, is at once re-
jected. Suppliers of steel, knowing this exacti-
tude of test, are careful to furnish only the very
best quality. During the progress of construction
from first to last, Massey-Harris bicycles, in the
hands of trained workmen, are subjected to the
closest scrutiny ; and it is to the care thus exer-
cised that the name of Massey-Harris to-day
stands foremost in the world of cycling manu-
facturers.*
Artist Nelson Illingworth, whose life-like
bust of Edmund Barton has been so much ad-
mired, is now engaged upon a bust of Cardinal
Moran.
Artist Frank P. Mahony has been ap-
pointed Art Instructor to N.S.W. Art Society’s
classes. He succeeds Cordon Coutts, and artists
agree that the appointment is a capital one.
W. H. Malyon, of Ballarat, (Vic.), adver-
tises Ligmolliene Cream Soap as a pure, neutral,
strongly antiseptic, and curative soap, for the
treatment of parasitic and the various superficial
affections of the skin, among which may be men-
tioned itching, prickly-heat, chapped hands, sun-
burn, etc. It allays instantaneously all irritation'
and soreness, and is especially valuable for the
cleansing of wounds and ulcers. It will also be
found a thorough luxury for shampooing, effec-
tually cleansing the scalp from dandriff, and for
all nursery and bath purposes.*
“Melb.”: General Booth, during his
present visit, has always gone about in the finest
hired landau, drawn by high-stepping horses, that
can be obtained. Let me not blame him. To do
otherwise might be Tartuffy. The coachman, a
handsome, dashing, Regulation clean-shaven
young wedding-party Jehu, doesn’t look Saved a
bit. He wears a black bell-topper, like the
Generalissimo himself. Also a clarety coat plentir
fully studded with bright brass buttons. Why
not the red band round his hat, or a red belltopper
altogether, like Commandant Booth’s cap ?
HIS LAST WISH.
M.D.: “I will not deceive you; you have but a
short lime to live. If you have a last wish ”
B.A.D.: “I also will not deceive you; I have a
last wish. It is that I employed another
doctor! ”
“E.0.”-: The most up-to-date men in
Brisbane are the ’bus-drivers. Counted seven of
them in Queen-street last Saturday night, each
with his “ donah ” beside him on the box-seat.
Admiral Dewey’s message to the interfering
German Admiral at Manilla—“ If he wants a fight he
can have it right now ’’—showed true Yankee
grit. Bracket that grit with John Bull’s sound
sense and judgment, and the combination cannot
be beaten. This is the case with the London
and American Supply Stores, Bourke Street, Mel-
bourne. Send for their catalogue and you’ll find
they cannot be beaten for style, quality, price, or any
other desideratum.*
Miss Duncan, the energetic N.S.W. Govt,
factory inspector, thus candidly discourses in her
latest official report:—
More than half the pressure which women-workers are
subjected to in the market-place is due to the absence of
cohesion in their ranks. As a class, they appear to be
unable to offer that united resistance which characterises
the unions of men.
The world moves ! Fifty years ago, a Govt,
official who would thus incite to unionism would
hear the bells of authority ringing.

“The White Man’s Burden”
Has during the last decade been
considerably lightened by the
advent of the Pneumatic Tyred
Safety Bicycle. It was the ad-
vent of
Duniqp Tyres
in 1888 that first brought the
advantages and possibilities of
the cycle before the public. The
adoption of detachable Dunlops
in ’92 further popularised cycling,
and brought it within the reach
of all ; and now the culminating
.point is reached by our placing
on the market the nearest ap-
proach to a Perfect Cycle Tyre
ever attained. The new tyres
will be known as the
MULTIFLEX
Dunlop Tyres
and will be speedily recognised
by all Australian cyclists as
a necessity, when Com-
fort, Speed, Reliability,
and Ease of Attachment
are the desiderata.
First in 1888.
Foremost ever since.
We have taken up the white man’s
burden,
And issued a tyre so strong,
That in future the new Multifiex
Dunlops
Will carry all cyclists along.
No need for further anxieties,
All cyclists can ride on in peace ;
The new Multiflex tyres are beauties,
Guaranteed to ensure comfort and
ease.
We have taken up the white man’s
burden,
In helping the mighty throng
Of cyclists who wheel o’er Australia
In the delights of wheeling along,
Safe on their Multiflex Dunlops,
To accomplish by deeds on the wheel
The art of seeing the country
By means of the Dunlop wheel.
We have taken up the white man’s
burden
By giving a tyre that will stand,
To those cyclists who ride for plea-
sure—
Those of the happy band ;
So that the roughest of roads have
no terrors,
Nor the puncture-fiend the power to
detract,
From the pleasures derived from
wheeling
Way back on the old coach track.

it is used, and free from dan-

dangerous, and ought not to
be used except under medical
advice. A headache cui e, fi ee
from every objection, is ob-
tainable, and known as

Scientific Examination of Mighty “ALOK”
By the most eminent authority in Australia, and for many years at the Sydney University,
Dr. HELMS, M.A., F.C.S., Consulting and Analytical Chemist.
“Messrs. FISHER & CO. “8 Bridge-street, Sydney, February 1, 1898.
“ Gentlemen.—l have examined your preparation, MIGHTY ‘ ALOK,’ and find that it contains,
besides Kola Nut, only pure vegetable drugs having well-known tonic properties.
“ Yours faithfully, A. HELMS.”
Guaranteed not to contain Quinine or Iron, or any injurious ingredient.
GOLD MEDAL AT THE ROYAL AGRICULTURAL SHOW, SYDNEY.
Alok has arrested the attention of Doctors and Scientists throughout the whole of
Australia; it is acknowledged to be the most marvellous life-giving vitalising tonic
of the century ; at one bound it has placed itself in the front rank of Pharmacy as the
most perfect stimulator and restorer of the whole nervous and muscular system.
It acts l.ke a charm on the blood, nervous and digestive systems ,- it puts new life
and energy into the whole body; it restores the lost bloom of health to pale, tired
faces, and sends rich, red, pure blood coursing through the veins.
It gives health, strength and energy; it makes weak people strong, despondent
minds merry.
Madame ALBANI,
THE QUEEN OF SONG, AND THE FRIEND OF HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN OF
GREAT BRITAIN, writes, unsolicited, the following testimony:—
“The- ‘ Australia ’ Hotel, Sydney, March 29, 1898.
“ Dear Sirs. —I shall be much obliged if you will send me two bottles of your preparation, ‘ ALOK.’
I am very glad to tell you that this tonic was of great service to me on the sea, and in helping me to
recover from the effects of my long voyage. IT IS OF GREAT BENEFIT IN STOPPING SEA-
SICKNESS, AND OF GREAT ASSISTANCE TO ANYONE WHO HAS FATIGUING
WORK TO DO.—lam yours, very truly, E. ALBANI GYE.”
There is no greater believer in Mighty “ALOK” than Madame Albani. It is her constant companion.
Mr. J. L. JACOBSEN, Champion Chess Player of Australasia, forwards, unsolicited, the following
Testimonial, which speaks for itself: —
“School of Arts, Sydney.
“Dear Sirs, —As a cure for brain weakness and lassitude I have proved Mighty ‘ALOK’ a mar-
vellous tonic. A dose before commencing enables me to endure the arduous strain of match-play with
little fatigue. I consider it a boon to brain-workers, and heartily recommend it to all Chess Players.”
WHAT HENRY BRACY, Esq., SAYS ABOUT FISHER & CO.’S
MIGHTY “ALOK.”
“ Henry Bracy’s English and Comic Opera Company, Sydney,
“Lyceum Theatre, March 6th, 1897.
“ Messrs. FISHER & CO. Gentlemen, —It is with much pleasure that I testify to the merits of
your Mighty ‘ ALOK.’ In my professional vocation lam very often tired and fatigued after long and
worrying rehearsals, and I find great benefit at the time from a dose of your Tonic with a little soda-
water. It invariably has a most reviving effect, and I have got quite fond of it.—Yours faithfully,
“H. BRACY.”

“D.C.L.”
When applied to a man is a high Academic- dis-
tinction. When applied to whisky “ D.C.L.” is
the highest distinction it can possess. “ D.C.L.”
(Black Bottle) Scotch Whisky is perfect.*
Queensland is used by the N.S.W. anti-
Federalists as a great number of stalking-horses
of various colors. According to Sydney D.T., no
Federation can be acceptable toN.S. Wales unless
Queensland is in it from the start, and the peoplo
of N.S.W. ought not to be allowed to vote for
Federation except on the condition that Queens-
land comes in. Also, that journal is convinced
that Queensland has not the least intention of
coming in. Likewise, it warns the sugar-growers
of N.S.W. that Queensland will certainly come
in and ruin them by competition. In short,
the D.T. is truly Federal, but it urges the
people of N.S. Wales not to federate without
Queensland, and it beseeches the people of the
northern rivers not to federate with Queensland.
Moreover, Queensland won’t federate even if
N.S.W. does ; but N.S.Wales must on no account
federate until Queensland does.
The Earl of Chatham, with his sword outdrawn,
Stood waiting for Sir Richard Strachan ;
Sir Richard, longing to be at ’em,
Stood waiting for the Earl of Chatham.
But the D.T. goes one better. It expresses itself
keenly anxious that the Earl and Sir Richard
should advance as soon as possible ; but it forebodes
fearful disaster if either of them starts without
the other, and instant annihilation if they both
start together.
COLEMANE’S EUCALYPTE IS POPULAR
because it is pure, strong, and the most effective
chest remedy in the world. Remember —Sold
in ioz. and loz. bottles only. Trade mark,
“Eucalypte.”
There is no end to the anti-Federal calum-
nies of Sydney D.T. Twice within a week
—in its news columns on April 25, and in a lead-
ing article on May I—that1 —that veracious journal has
revived the well-known libel that Federation
means “ twopenny postage all over the metropolis.”
For this grotesque assertion there is not one
vestige of foundation. All that the Constitution
says about postage is that the postal department,
and the power to make laws as to postage, are to
be transferred to the Federal Govt. Everyone
knows that one immediate result of Federation
will be (as it was in the U.S., in Canada, and in
every other Federation that the world has ever
known) the reduction of postage-rates—with the
one probable exception that newspaper-proprietors
will no longer be allowed by the people of Aus-
tralia to have their wares circulated free at public
expense.

Half-caste Shipp, champion little ’un of the
nursery of Griffo, Tweedie and co. (“the Rocks”), met
that all-grit, stocky-built seven-stunner Watson at Alham-
bra A.O. (Sydney) on Saturday night. They started out
on a 15-rounds journey, but little more than a fifth of
that distance sufficed for the almond-eyed one, who, after
a sultry time, during- which he mixed things surprisingly,
quit in his corner badly used-up. Same night and same
place, second round of 10.4 novioe tournament was de-
cided. Chan tier swung his right at Wilson soon after
starting, and sent him star-gazing instanter. Latter
assumed the perpendicular twice, only to be at once
sent down each time, and was counted out on third
occasion. All over in 2min. Griffiths and Ballard went
for each other savagely-sprawling, biffing, banging, and
butting like the raw ’uns at the game they were, until
Ballard lay prone—pumped out, mostly through the stiff
pace the pair had set themselves, for very few punches
got home on either side. Five minutes saw this bout
through. Peter Nelson, fifth man, was left in, and drew
the bye.

Golden Gate A.C. (Sydney) 9st. Novice Tourna-
ment finished Saturday night, Lenton and King met in
final and fought like two old washerwomen throughout
seven rounds, but made things merry in the eighth.
King, wearing a Mephisto-like grin set off by sundry
splashes of life-fluid, looked murderous, but wasn’t.
Though Lenton had scored a big surplus of points referee
couldn’t separate them, and ordered another round,
which was as savagely contested as a dog-fight, King
leading this time. Referee at fault again, and declared
the go a draw. Lenton and King, therefore, whacked
the first and second money (£25). Every follower of the
game is now wondering how Lenton" beat Syd. Dunn
(brother of Charlie of the perennial smile) in the second
round.

“ Bare-’Uns ”: What game fetches more money
for the promoter than fist-fighting in Sydney just now ?
Saw Alhambra A.C. programme through Saturday night
last—returns showed 800 people present. At Golden
Gate, place packed— not an inch of squeezing room.
Ambitious embryo Foleys and Jacksons were knocking
lumps off each other. Patrons of the big-priced seats
wielded fans (supplied by management) in true Jap.
style. Sections of the house took sides, cheering and
jeering alternately, and frequently supplying a beautiful
blend of both. Profits on novice competition must be
big, as the several rounds of heats are usually spread over
four nights and the prize-money, never totals more than
£3O. New “ clubs ” are opening at Newtown, Pyrmont,
and Balmain ; the metrop. area will bristle with them
shortly.

Pirate footballer Jack Conlon fights again to-
night (Saturday), at Sydney, when he will be up against
one of the toughest tasks set him since he started the
fistic game. His opponent, Dan. O’Connell, the Captain’s
Flat miner, is one of the right sort—a natural fighter.
His knowledge of the game was inborn, and not acquired
in a gymnasium. Writer saw Daniel fight one of the
most bitterly-contested battles ever witnessed at Seale’s
gymnasium (Sydney), close on three years ago, when he
quite smashed up big 6ft. Dawson, of Braidwood. The
pair came down country specially for the mill, and a good
stake hinged on the outcome. Dawson was very game,
but Dan. proved too shifty for the big fellow—his right
and left swings were a revelation, and carried all before
them. Cordon's superior skill may pull him through, but
he’ll know he has been in a hot mill ere the pride of Cap-
tain’s Flat goes under.

Conditions of L. Foley’s (Sydney) champion tug-
of-war tournament have induced several teams from war-
vessels in port to enter. “ Jack ” will now-be able to pull
as he likes it best—in his bare feet—and not to be dis-
advantaged thereby. Reported that A.U.S.N. team -
winners of St. Patrick’s Day sports’ tug—wore small
spades on their heels to grip the turf. Soft- hands beat
the police 10 on last occasion, but they’ll be all right next
time, as those powerful paws are being well soaked in
brine.

The two strongest men in Sydney just now, if
not the strongest yet seen there, Pagel and Rennert
(Germans), had no idea, a few months ago, of entering the
brawn-and-thew profession. Rennert was persuaded to
leave his billet as stoker aboard the Prinz Regent Luitpold
to meet ’rastler Harry Dunn at Graeco-Roman, but latter
wasn’t taking any, while Pagel, until recently, was
kitchen-man, or something similar, in a Sydney restau-
rant. Both performed well at Cansdell-Lorenz wrestling
match the other night. Pagel put up 701bs. sphere and
lOOlbs. bell to arm’s length with one hand ; lifted 1921bs
and 2561b5. bar-bells with both hands to arms' length
above head on separate occasions, letting instrument
drop each time and catching it on forearm. Rennert
elevated 1401bs. and 701bs. simultaneously ; lay on his back
on floor and lifted 1921b5. bell to arms’ length, square from
chest, allowed 12st. man to rest upon it and then replaced
the huge weight !

contracting provinces are kicking vigorously, and swear
they won’t send teams, owing to length of absence neces-
sary. Bananalanders refuse point-blank to give way.
The finish should be interesting.

The brown gelding, Pardon, a son of Blair-
gowrie, who scored an easy wfh at Canterbury, t’other
day, is a likely sort, and promises to go far towards tak-
ing the place of some of our departed cracks. In afore-
said race his party “ came at him ’’ at last minute, backed
him from “ any price Pardon ” down to 3 to 1 and made
no mistake, for “he finished hard-held and alone.” If
Pardon turns out half as well as his half-brother Blair, he
won’t be weighted much below “ Old Pardon, the son of
Reprieve.”

The double at Moorefield on Saturday proved a
soft snap for the (Queenslander, Cavalier—a half-brother
to game old Battalion. Nothing could ask him to gallop
in either race, and he should have no trouble in beating
Sydney’s present collection of nags in yet another event
or two. Leperland is far behind the other provinces in
the matter of racing, but horses from there mostly'
manage to pay expenses and a bit over when they come
to Sydney.

It is left to a pony-club to first give the much-
naaded stipendiary steward a trial in Sydney. The Rose-
bery Park people, have decided to appoint a paid man,
whose duty will be to not only watch the races, but
study the betting, and generally look out for “cases.”
If they can only hit upon a large, honest, strong-
willed, relentless individual, who doesn’t bet and is no
respecter of persons, Sydney pony-racing will boom even
more than now. What sort of an ideal stipendary
steward have the A.J.O. authorities within their reach in
starter “Tom” Watson—a straight, hard-headed man,
who knows all there is to know, and doesn’t bet!

Refreshing to find Forest, the Newmarket
Handicap winner, vindicating the reputation of “form”
in the Hill Handicap at last V.R.C. meeting. Carrying
191bs. more than his Newmarket weight, Forest started
at 7to 4, and won handsomely. The same horse in the
hands of the average Yic. trainer would have been run-
ning “stiff” or out of condition by this time, with a
view to getting favorably treated in another big race.

A horse who won’t be far down on the list of
winning sires at the end of the season is the Newcastle
(N.S.W.) imported horse Metal. His stock, which have
been winning races by the dozen in and around New-

ney, and one of them—Magnet, a big, handsome black—
was a winner at Moorefield on Saturday.

The utter contempt in which Collingwood tote-
man Wren holds the detectives and all their works may
be faintly imagined when it is considered that he has
been running his tote ever since the last raid, despite the
serious charge pending against him. The authorities

before they can suppress this indomitable bettor.

Mr. Frank Madden’s suggestion to his brother
committee-men of the V.R.C. that a mile course should
be made inside the ordinary track at Flemington was
advisedly negatived, but had "he proposed that a straight
mile should be formed, doubtless he would have carried
his point. At ’Otne the straight mile is a feature on
every good course of the modern order, it being a sine-
qua-non with all courses that applv for registration.

Q.T.C. works in mysterious ways. At all the

but coincident with a committee-man’s hurdle champion

dozen or so owners of leppers who were waiting for the
big meetings in May and August.

in fast time, paying the handsome div. of £2B 10s.”

Yic. demise Editor Geo. R. Rippon, of
Hamilton Spectator. About 35 years ago he was un-
questionably in the first eleven of Vic. cricket, as a dash-
ing bat and effective bowler, and might at all events have
become a Tommy Wills did he not wisely subserve cricket,
as he did racing and all sport, to the side-showing of
journalism. He attained the respectable journalistic, age
of 61, almost that of -worthy little Skipjack Williams, of
Ballarat Star, who lately hoppyjigged over to the
bloated staff of the New Jerusalem Gazette. Had he
cared, Rippon might have had a throw-in for the sporting
editorship of the Australasian when Hammersley was
ousted, and “ Augur ” Chapman got it. First at Geelong,
afterwards at Hamilton, he made himself the only man in
his sphere. The Spec, may obtain as good a one, but it
will take local years to construct him.

The successes of Merman, Georgic, and now
Newhaven in England seem to have brought about a re-
vival of ’Murkan competition. Yankee horses did noth-
ing very remarkable on the other side of the Atlantic
since ’BO, or thereabouts (when Parole, Iroquois, and Fox-
hall were boss performers), until Sibola captured the One
Thousand Guineas Stakes last week. Sibola belongs to-
Mr. Pierre Larillard, who won the English Derby with

Australian teams have always kicked at the

Darling’s election as captain of the Australian
team (with Trumble as vice) shows how wofully out of it
were the prophets who tipped Worrall for the billet.
Darling’s selection is something of an experiment, con-
sidering his poor judgment in many eases when leading
the S.A. eleven, but Worrall would never have done.
But why wasn’t Kelly selected for vice instead of
Trumble ?

Huge “Alick” Mackenzie, than whom, when he

out when playing for Paddington v. N. Sydney in Sydney
premiership final on Saturday ; smacked up 40 runs in >

“ flyers,” all lovely strokes. If he would but stick to-
hitting be the most popular batsman in Aus-
tralia, and a certainty for ’Ome for years to come, but
always, just when his chance looks brightest, he takes to
stonewalling and ruins it.

An interesting cricket problem was raised in &
recent Sydney junior match—Marylebone v. Invincible.
At a. critical stage of the game, a Marylebone batsman
received a hall that bumped high, and, instinctively-
throwing up his hand to save himself a smack in the eye,
the. ball hit it and was caught by a fieldsman, who ap-
pealed ; batsman was given out “ handled ball.” Puzzle :
Was he out, and, if so, how ? What is wrong with a ver-
dict of “caught,” anyhow? The rules state that a bats-
man is out if caught off a hall that strikes him anywhere
on the forearm. In above case, batsman decided he-
wasn’t out, and it took 20min. hard argument, in which
spectators joined, to shift him.

E. Melb. won the premiership pennant with
Carlton runners-up. Both teams suffered defeat in the-
final round, East by Richmond, and Carlton abandoning
the match against S. Melb. For Carlton, Warne’s batting
figures are 140 (not out), 56, 77, 402, 17, 131, 120, 29, 49; .
total, 1011 ; average, 127.6. An aggregate of over a
thousand runs is unprecedented in Melb. club cricket.
Sundries ’ (Melb.): The scoring-board on
Sydney Cricket Ground is, undoubtedly, the best in the
world. Stoddart says so, and he is an authority on
barrackers and boards. Ned Gregory planned and built
it in all its perfection, and it is because of Gregory’s death
that I write lest people should overlook the builder and
give the credit to someone else.

East Adelaide will probably be the “ swaggah ”

South Adelaide and Port Adelaide, S.A.’s two
strongest football teams, have seceded from the local
Association as a result of the adoption of the electorate
system, favored by the other teams and carried last year.
The result is chaos, and the probability of the game,
already very low in public esteem, further declining.

TELEGRAPHY WITH WIRES.
The Daily Telegraph is out of date,
“ Wireless telegraphy ”’s the theme, of late,
But not to this oar Telegraph aspires—
The same old Geebungs pull the same old wires.
THE GEEBUNG.
What is a Geebung, friend ? I prythee say.
A sickly berry on a stunted shrub ;
Its habitat, the shores of Botany Bay ;
Its rotting root it thinks the wide world’s hub.
Last Monday night some thousands of
people were sardine-packed in the galleries and
floor and platform and walls of Sydney Cen-
tennial Hall to hear Premier Reid and Australia
Barton speak on Federation. Every available
inch of room was occupied, the statue-niches, the
platform railing, and even the crevices of the
great organ. At 8.10 p.m. the crowd unable to
gain admission was so great that a late-comer
thought the show was over and the vast hall was
emptying. Inside, from the platform, the crowd
looked like the waves of an angry sea with’a hat
on the top of each wave. Just below the plat-
form was a little half-moon where the people
sat; beyond that all was confusion. Every-
one was standing on his chair with others
behind leaning on his shoulders, and their per-
spiration streaming down his back. Hoots,
yells, cat-calls, and blasphemy were pitched
at the Premier from an organised anti-Federal
gang that defied anyone to interfere with it. One
huge, grimy giant in a blue shirt and slouched hat
led the chorus of “ Well hang George Reid on a
sour apple-tree,” till an enthusiastic Australian
suddenly kicked „the chair from under him, and,
when the heap that fell was sorted out, fought a
pitched battle and laid the grimy giant out. The
big man could sing better than he could fight.
Away on the left a battle raged for fully two
minutes between a howling ruffian, who used a
chair right and left, and three others v, ho were
determined to, and eventually did, put him
out. What the Premier said was utterly in-
audible, for every outburst of hoots and yells
was met with a mighty counter - cheering
that completely swamped it. Some bold spirits
in the body of the hall proposed to rush the plat-
form, and shouted their intention; it was met
with fierce invitations to “ Come on you—Gee-
bungs ! ” “Try it on, you—curs!” And they
didn’t. At the prospect of sucli a melee, a man
in the southern gallery shrieked : “ O, my bleed-
ing country ! —O, poor Australia ! ” and he was
so overcome with emotion that he leaned over the
railing, and sadly emptied his large and luxurious
tea over the howling mob beneath. Talk about
turning on a fire-hose! This writer has never
seen a crowd scatter with such rapidity as did
that beneath the sad patriot. They simply
vanished, without stopping even to curse him.
Then the organised larynx of interruption began
to fail, and it seemed as if there was going to be a
chance of hearing what the Premier was saying—
till it was found that he was explaining about
the taxation. As this was what the Cabbage-tree
mob especially wished to prevent people hearing,
the din re-commenced, and it and the alternate
cheering lasted right up till the speaker sat down.
When Barton took the floor, a fresh crowd, reser-
vists apparently, took up the yelling—there was
no foot-stamping, as no one to speak of had his
feet on the floor, and the chairs that supported
the audience were reeling and utterly unfit to
stand stamping on. And, on the whole, it was
just as impossible to hear Barton as it had been to
hear Reid—as much by reason of his supporters’
cheers as on account of the Geebung yells. At
9.35 the “ Glory-Al.elujah ” chorus started again,
the man who led it being hoisted on to the shoul-
ders of others. He was attacked, and another
stand-up fight ensued, which resulted in his
being smashed and passed out. That scared
them a bit. When Barton had finished,
the Premier got up and called upon those
in favor of “Federation under the Bill ”
to hold up both hands ; and he waved his own
aloft. Up went a mighty forest of all sorts and
conditions of paws ; and a great cheering crashed
through the building, and the forest of paws
waved sticks, handkerchiefs, and hats, and sank
down. Premier Reid placed his hands to his
mouth and yelled : “ For the contrary—now,
then, you Geebungs ! ” And a thin sprinkling of
hands fluttered slowly and dejectedly in various
parts of the hall, and then collapsed amidst deri-
sive laughter. Apropos, anyone desirous of see-
ing how the wheels go round should compare the
reports of this meeting published in the rival
papers, S.M. Herald and Sydney Daily Tele-
graph of May 2.
That masterful and benevolent lady, Mrs.
Jane Darvall, widow (second wife) of the lato
Major Edward Darvall, a Peninsidar officer who
came to N.S.W. in the old days, and stepmother
of the late John Bailey Darvall, the notable
N.S. Wales Q.C., died last week. Mrs. Darvall had
strong political and religious opinions, and will be
especially mourned in Orange circles. Sydney
D.T. eagerly recounts how she condemned the
Federation Enabling Bill, and “ that good-for-
nothing Reid” with her almost dying breath.
Mrs. Darvall was a fine old lady and real Cabbage-
tree ; many poor people will have reason to bo
sorry she is no more.

hoards half-inch thick are pierced by it at 10 yards. The weapon can be tired 30 times in one minute, as the ever under breech
works very rapidly loading and cocking the gun by the one action. The magazine is mckel-plated and stock of best polished heart
aluut sights accurately set and tested, and the body of the rifle is handsomely and durably japanned; in fact, workmanship and
npearance are equal to any rifle costing £5, for each rifle is a splendid example of the gun-maker’s art, assisted by the most
nodern machinery. The rifle we offer is 1808 model, the latest improved pattern, lhe ammunition used is shot, 8.8. size, which
•an be uurcliased anywhere at 3d. per pouhd, lienee the cost of using this wonderful rifle is almost nothing. In purchasing tow
rifle from us you secure our guarantee that it is all that we claim for It, or that we will refund money No sportsman >lrru<i
be without this magnificent weapon. There is no danger in its use and even boys and youths may use it without risk r.os air
compressing mechanism is a perfect invention, being the simplest and most durable ever used. The air chamber is constructed
on a principle which gives great strength and it will withstand a pressure of many pounds to the square inch. The pull-off of the
trigger is rather less than in ordinary rifles, conducing to great rapidity of firing. The Maxim Repeating Air Rifls u about 33
inches lone from muzzle to heel-plate, the weight is about 4 pounds, which is light enough to cause no fatigue and heavy enough
to ensure Accurate shooting. The illustration gives an idea of its appearance, but it must be seen and used to be thoroughly apprt*
ciated For target practice no rifle made can surpass it. Small game of all kinds at reasonable range fall victims to its ? raa *

Every cough makes your throa u more raw

From the first dose the quiet and rest
begin; the tickling in the throat ceases; the
spasm weakens; the cough disappears. Do
not wait for jmeumonia and consumption but
cut short your cold without delay.
Ayer’s Cherry Pectoral cures because it
heals. It goes to the very seat of trouble,
quiets the 'inflammation and makes a perma-

preventive to all serious lung troubles.

THE ILLUSTRATED LONDON NEWS of
Sept. 28, 1895, says:
“ If I were asked which single medicine I should
prefer to take abroad with me, as likely to be
most generally useful, to the exclusion of all
others, I should say Chlorodyne. I never travel
without it, and its general applicability to the
relief of a large number of simple ailments forms
its best recommendation.”
Concerning the Sydney Dawn and Dusk
Club'
Dear Bulletin.—l write £o you as a journal with calm
horse-sense, and ask you to hereby make public the fact
that the above club‘is not—as lam informed it has been
variously represented to be a society of anarchists or an
association of devil-worshippers, or even a circle of
mutual admirers. The persons who have made these
statements about if may be highly-respected liars in their
own social sphere, but they are not Duskers, and conse-
quently know nothin” of Duskerism. And what is
Duskerism? A few' of the club maxims may explain :
Roost high and. crow low.
(This fine saying, which has been made the club motto,
is, by some authorities, attributed to the late Bishop of
Bath and Wells; by others to the recent prelate of Sodor
and Man. The origin of wisdom is, however, not a vital
question.)
Do your best work, and don’t get miserable because
another Dusker has done better.
Crow low about your own work. Crow high about the
good work of your friends.
Don’t be too proud. There are harder cases than you
alive.
Don’t look at life too seriously—it is a game.
Don’t look at life too frivolously—it is a game of keeps.
Be happy and you will be virtuous.
Be a Dusker and you will be happy.!
Duskerism is no new thing. It is old as the better sort
of philosophy. Democritus was a typical Dusker. Socrates
was a Dusker and might be a Heptareh now if he were
alive. Anacreon and Horace and Hafiz w 7 ere Duskers.
So were Shakespeare, Montaigne and Rabelais. Not so
were Virgil and Dante and Milton and Dr. Johnson. They
w'ere great men with little humor, and, therefore, not
eligible as former members of the Club, though certain
living members have worked hard to have them
placed on the roll of Deceased Duskers. But it could
not be. The line had also to be drawn at Byron. In
many respects he was fit to be a Departed Dusker, but his
selfishness blackballed him. The living members of the
club are men who write a little, or paint a little, or even
think a little, and take some interest in books and music
and pictures and the graces of life. When they meet
they criticise each other’s work with bracing l candor, and
chasten each other’s conceit by judicious chaffing. They
meet when they wish to meet. The origin of the
i , e of the club is too obvious to need explanation. The
rules of the club are 22 in number, and are printed
in Chinese so as not to give offence to-members. The
only person who understands them is the Heptareh who
hlls the office of Interpreter, and he has power to inter-
pret them when occasion arises in the way that he may
deem most suitable to the emergency. The club does not
w, ®‘ l wake proselytes. It includes the best dead men
and the best-meaning live men, and is satisfied.—A
Heptarch of the Dawn and Dusk Club.

When the tired far-west township hasn’t
its herd of pigs, it has its flock of goats, though
sometimes, if it is very tired, it has both. Round
Hill, the scene of an early Barrier silver-boom of
great dimensions, is among those doubly blest;
and, besides, it has a bit of a sand-bank back of
its pub. Lately it was noticed that the sand-bank
had a new fascination for the pigs; and when
somebody, in an unusual spurt of enterprise,
walked the three or four hundred yards to the
pig-magnet he found what was left of a man’s
body. Then the explorer remembered that, three
or four months before, his mate had gone to the
pub., and hadn’t got back to camp yet; and what
was left looked like him.

The long-suffering ’busman, concerning the

dam wimmen stands considering on the back step
the best part of an hour. They want to go up to
show their hankies, and their men-folks objects.
Now here y’are—just watch.” A couple hailed

HAVE YOU
A BAD LEG
with Wounds that Discharge or otherwise, perhaps sur-
rounded with inflammation and swollen that when you
press your finger on the inflamed part it leaves the impres-
sion ? If so, under the skin you have poison that deties all
the remedies you have tried, which, if not extracted, you
never can recover, but go on suffering till death releases
you. Perhaps your knees arc swollen, the joinls being
ulcerated; the same with the ankles, round which the skin
may be discoloured, or there may be wounds ; the disease
if allowed to continue will deprive you of the povei to
walk. You may have attended various hospitals and had
medical advice, and been told your case is hopeh ss, or
advised to submit to amputation ; but do not, for i CAN
CURE YOU. I don’t say perhaps ; but I WILL. Because’
others have failed is no reason for not now' being cured.

A. Living Witness ol the virtues of the
Aifaline Herbal Remedies.
Kalgoorlie, September 12, 1898.
To Herr Rassmussen.
Rear Sir.—l feel it my duty to write and tell you how
your remedies have cured me.
I suffered great agony with WEAK NERVES and
RHEUMATICS, and I sent for some of your ALFALINE
REMEDIES, which completely cured me, and I have felt
as well as I could-wish, although it is two rears ago.
I also tried your ALFALINE UNIVERSAL PILLS,
which completely cleared my skin and purified my blood,
and I am now using your ALFALINE HAIR RESTORER,
which lias thoroughly cleaned the scalp and made the
hair grow again, and it has gradually turned the hair
from being grey to that of its original color. I have also
recommended your Remedies for a number of different
complaints and I have never known them to fail, but to
do ail that was claimed for them. I have great pleasure
to recommend these remedies to all sufferers, as I know
they can be depended on.
You are at liberty to publish this as well as my photo.
Yours truly, C. J. A. NIELSEN.

recommended the Aifaline Remedies to a number of my
constituents, and I will do the same to all whom I hear
complaining of rheumatic attacks. With kind regards,
I have the honor to be, yours truly,

Dear Sir, —Having suffered for some time from a com-
plaint of the liver and kidneys, for which I took medical
advice, with no effect, I one day was fortunate enough to
pick up one of your books in the bush. I was thus in-
duced to try your Aifaline Remedies, and their effect was
magical. I have often since recommended them to my
neighbors, all of whom have felt the benefit as well as
myself. I cannot express how glad lamat my recovery,
as several doctors had given me up, as my husband can
testify.—Yours truly, (Signed) Mrs. H. SMITH.

VITADATIO.
Thousands Have Been Brought Back from
the Gates of the Unseen World.
CURED THOUSANDS. CURE YOU.
T ADIES, —The best Preserver and Beautifler is
-LJ “ YITADATIO.”
LADIES, —The deadlj' enemy of health and beauty,
clearness of complexion, and buoyancy of
spirits is Constipation.
VITADATIO is the DEADLY ENEMY of
all THESE TROUBLES.
LADIES, VITADATIO is a most magnificent
Cleanser of all the Blood Disorders. There-
fore, is the perfection of
FEMALE MEDICINE.
VITADATIO is undoubtedly a PERFECT WONDER
in its MARVELLOUS MARCH of SUCCESSES.
ILLUSTRATIONS OF THE MARVELLOUS
- 1 - BENEFICIAL EFFECTS
OF
VITADATIO
Are Daily Received by Mr. PALMER.
Torpid, Sluggish Liver and Bilious Headaches are
distressing enough, and unfit one for the business of
life. The victim of such calamities cannot enjoy a
meal, must not eat this, must not drink that. The
pleasure of living is gone.
Do you wish to enjoy the world in a reasonable
manner—Vigorous Health, No Headache, No Consti-
pation ? Then you are earnestly solicited to Try
VITADATIO, THE MIRACLE WORKER.
It has Cured Thousands; will Cure You.
Do not let prejudice or sentiment or obstinacy rule.
Try a course, and you will become an enthusiast.
I ADIES and GENTLEMEN,—You cannot ignore
J-J downright conmionsense facts, and where health
is concerned, banish all prejudice and sentiment.
“ VITADATIO ” has established its worthiness ; it
has cured the incurable, and sprung into popular favor,
entirely on its merits. It is the herbal remedy. No
imitation, no quack production. If you are ill, try it;
you will then become an enthusiast.
MONUMENT OP GRATITUDE.
YITADATIO
has a pillar of fame, nobly earned, and willingly
erected by the blessings of a grateful people.
Palmer is proud of the good that is being done.
Success in business is a worthy aim, but success in re
lieving those ready to perish carries with it a feeling of
happiness that the selfish man can never experience. ■
INCURABLES, COME to YITADATIO. Con-
sumptives; Come. Cancer Sufferers, Come. Hydatids,
Bright’s Disease, Excruciating Rheumatism, Blood Dis-
eases, Pains, Aches—bring them to VITADATIO and
get quit of them.
JNFLUENZA.
Inclement seasons bring a heavy train of annoying,
expensive, and dangerous ailments.
WARD THEM OFF WITH “VITADATIO.”
“ Prevention is better than cure.”
“ The foolish man locks the stable door after the steed
is stolen.”
INFLUENZA has killed thousands. Its after-effects
are frequently deadly—always distressing.
VITADATIO is a perfect cure for Influenza.
VITADATIO requires no puff; its Virtues and
Merits are recognised.
VITADATIO, THE ONLY GENUINE.
Any Other is a Weak Imitation.
WEBBER’S VITADATIO IS THE MOST
vv THOROUGH and COMPLETE
HEALTH RESTORER and LIFE GIVER that the
WORLD has EVER SEEN.
Consumption, Cancers, Debility, Nervous Exhaustion,
Nervous Depression, Hydatids, Bright’s Disease, Rheu-
matism, Lumbago and All Blood Disorders. Purify the
Blood, Cleanse the Blood, Nourish the Blood.
These instructions ought to be written in letters of
fire that all might see and know, and attend to them.
VITADATIO is Pure and True, safe alike for Young
and Old. VITADATIO, the Life-Giver. VITADATIO,
the Great Herbal Remedy. VITADATIO, the Miracle
Worker. Thousands to-day would be stretched on beds
of sickness were it not for VITADATIO.

WE recommend these Bitters to be taken two or three times a day; a wineglassful for an adult,
smaller quantity for children. For General Debility, Dyspepsia, Rheumatism, and Cutaneous
Affections. The action of Dandelion, more especially upon the liver and kidneys, is more reliable
for removing all impure secretions than any other medicinal plant known. Persons suffering
from Skin Diseases will find these Bitters invaluable. Directions for Use : One wineglass-
ful three times a day after meals, diluted with same quantity of water. Eor young people, about
half the quantity twice a day.

“Ah, talk of blessings ! What a blessing is diges-
tion ! To digest. l)o you know what it'means ?
It is to have the sun always shining and the shade
always ready for you. It is to be met by smiles
and greeted with kisses. It is to hear sweet sounds,
to sleep with pleasant dreams, to be touched ever
by gentle, soft, cool hands. It is to be in Paradise.
“ There came a great indigestion upon the earth
and it was called a deluge. All the evil comes
from this. Macbeth could not sleep.; it was the
supper, not the murder. His wife talked and
tallied ;it was the supper again. Milton had a
bad digestion, and Garlyle must have had the
worst digestion in the world. Ah !to digest is to
be happy ! ”
There ! —how does that strike you for a burst of
eloquence ? I quote from Trollope. If there is any-
thing wrong about the theology you must hold him
responsible. As for its physiology and pathology
(pardon all these “ologies ”) I can answer for the
correctness of these two. And so can millions of
people besides me. They speak of the curse of in-
digestion continually in every language; they
groan and writhe under it in every land and
climate.
‘ Por many years, ” says one of this innumerable
army of martyrs, “I was obliged to bear as best I
could the torments of indigestion. My appetite
was practically destroyed. I ate, of course, because
one must eat or die ! but after meals I had great
pain at the chest and around the sides.
Sleep almost forsook my pillow, and naturally I
was tired and exhausted. Sometimes better and
then worse, but never free from pain and illness, I
lived on with little or no hope of getting well. It
is hardly necessary to say that I had medical
treatment, yet no real benefit resulted from it.
Happily at this time Mother Seigel’s Syrup was
brought to my notice, and so strongly commended
that I laid aside other medicines, which were doing
me no good, and began using this one only.
“ In a short time I realised a great improvement;
food agreed with me and I gained strength. A
little later—continuing to take the Syrup regularly
as directed —the pains at the . stomach,, sides and
chest wholly ceased, and I have not felt them
since. My indigestion was cured at last, and I en-
joyed the blessing of health. My son, who suffered
severely from rheumatism has been relieved by
Mother Seigel’s Syrup as by nothing else he ever
tried. In gratitude I give you full permission to
publish my letter should you desire.” (Signed)

she had a personal talk with Mr. Smith, the
butcher at llushden. He told the lady that in his
opinion if she went on suffering from indigestion
and asthma (one of its consequences) it would be
because she neglected to use Mother Seigel’s
Syrup. “ And,” said Mr, Smith, “I speak from
knowledge. ” She had been ill with this abomin-
able ailment for many years, and had spent time
and money in unavailing efforts to obtain relief.
Acting on Mr. Smith’s advice, Mrs. Gell began
using this remedy at once, and tells the outcome
in a letter of which we have room for the con-
clusion only :
“ I was better almost immediately, and was
soon as well and healthy as one could wish to be.
Now I keep ‘ Mother Siegel ’ in the house, and it
never fails to help us when needed for any passing
complaint. ” (Signed) Sarah Gell, Oct. sth, 1898.
Judging from the force of his comment on the
disease, I should say Mr. Trollope knew some-
thing about indigestion from experience. Most
literary people do. To them, and to all other
victims I confidently commend the best remedy
yet found —Mother Seigel’s Syrup.
No Household should be without it To Farmers it is
invaluable. It should be found in every Stable.
All Athletes should use it. It Cures Speedily and
Permanently.

COUGHS, COLDS on the CHEST,
BRONCHITIS & ASTHMA
Rapidly Cured by
Heame’s Bronchitis Cure.
Those who have taken this medicine are amazed at its
wonderful influence. Sufferers from any form of bron-
chitis, distressing- cough, difficulty in breathing, hoarse-
ness, pain or soreness in the chest, experience delightful
and immediate relief, and to those who are subject to
colds on the chest it is invaluable, as it effects a complete
cure. It is most comforting in allaying tickling and irri-
tation in the throat, and giving strength to the voice, and
it never allows a cough or asthma to become chronic. No
house should be without it, as, taken at the beginning, a
dose is generally sufficient, and a complete cure is certain.
“ Mr. W. G. HEARNE. —Rear Sir, —I had a bad attack
of Bronchitis for six months, with dreadful hacking cough
day and night and great quantity of phlegm. Night
sweats came on and pains in my chest, and I got so weak
that I could not leave my bed. At this stage I was pro-
nounced to be in consumption 1 had a lot of medicines
of different kinds, but nothing did me any good until,
reading in the Aoe of your ‘ Bronchitis Cure,’ I got a
bottle, and after taking two doses I was much improved.
After taking two bottles the cough and night sweats left
me, my appetite returned, and I was able to get up ; and
am now in good health, for which I am truly grateful, and
shall recommend your Medicine to all my friends.—Yours
truly, E. SMITH, Halpin Park, Nhill, Victoria.”
“ After suffering from asthma until I was 17 years old,
and having been under a great many different treatments,
without benefit, I was induced to try Hearne’s Medicine
for Asthma. After taking three bottles of this medicine,
I quite g'>t. rid of the Asthma, and since then, which was
in the be,-,inning of 1883, 14 years ago, I have not had the
slightest return of it. The Medicine quite cure me, and
I have much pleasure in recommending it.—ALEX. J.
ANDERSON, Geelong, Victoria,.”
“ We, the undersigned, have had occasion to obtain
Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure, and we certify that it was per-
fectly and rapidly successful under circumstances which
undoubtedly prove its distinct healing power.” Signed by
the Rev. John Sinclair, Myers-street, Geelong, and 59
other leading residents.
Prepared only and sold wholesale and retail by the pro-
prietor W. G. HEARNE, Chemist, Geelong, Victoria.

A Perfect Rejuvenation.
The Case of
Mrs. CLARA CARTER.
(From the “ Penrith Times,” N.S. W.)
(BY OUR SI’ECIAL REPORTER.)
“My case,” said Mrs. Carter, of Com-
mercial street, Penrith, to our reporter, who
was questioning her as to her illness, “ was
one of simple weakness, a sort of gradual
decline, but it was a very serious tiling all
the same, and I firmly believe that if I had
not been fortunate enough to obtain a
I'cmedy which was able to supply what was
deficient in my blood, I should have wasted
and
Wasted Away Till I Died.
Tins wast ng disease (if you can call that a
disease) which showed no violent symptom,
or gave no direct acute pain, stole upon me all
unawares. If I had any pain it was only as a
result of my weakness. My blood was so
poor that my face went the
Colour of Yellow Soap—
very waxy looking- and my lips, the inside
of my eyelids, and my gums were a peculiar
white. I suffered very greatly from loss of
sleep. Strange as it may appear, I was too
weak and weary to even sleep. When I got
out of bed in the morning I could hardly lift
my arms, and in a few minutes I should he
quite tired out. My appetite was as weak
and faded as myself. No delicacies in-
duced a desire to eat, and my food was
not able to strengthen me. It didn’t digest
properly. I was not strong enough to
digest it, and from this cause alone I
suffered keen distress. I grew weaker,
more pale and wan, as regularly as the
hands of the clock went round. Little by
little
I Gave up my Work.
First, I had to cease washing the clothes,
and then came a time when I couldn’t even
wash the tea things, and in the end I was
not able to do anything at all. It took my
whole strength to sit up straight in my
chair.”
“ You must have been feeble?”
“ I got stiil more feeble, and my nerves
partook in the
General Debility of my System.
I was not able to stand anything. No
noises of any kind. 1 should scream out
with the shock if any unusu -1 sound struck
my ears. Iliad silly, nervi us terrors of all
sorts of things, and as my illness clung close
to me a heavy despondency settled upon
me. I began to look upon myself as a
hopeless invalid. I was too low-spirited
to take a hopeful view of anything. No
woman, I don’t care who she he, could have
felt more wretched than I did.”
“13ut the chemists and doctors. Could
they do nothing for you ?”
“No, indeed, the}*- couldn’t. Chemists I
tried without number, but they were all
failures; and lots of medicines and pills
were brought to me to ti y, but none of these
preparations improved my condition any, or
put an ounce of flesh upon my bones. Two
doctors also prescribed for me, and attended
me for long enough. I gave up the one for
the other, but neither of them could do me
any good, nor did I find their medicines of
any more service than the drugs I obtained
from the chemists.”
“ Well, how did you go on ?”
11 For 12 months 8 hadn’t been
able to work, but at last I
got into that state that I
couldn’t even walk*
At nights I frequently had to get into a
sitting posture, for I did not feel strong
enough to breathe properly when lying
down.”
“Did the bowel weakness coniiune ?”
“Yes ; that gave me never-ending trouble
and distress, and a feeling of faintness came
over me several times in the day. The sen-
sation was just as though I was about to
become unconscious. Then I bad to remain
in bed altogether. I thought the worst liad
now come about, and slowly my last hopes
of restoration to health dribbled away. It
looked as though I was to waste away a
Victim to Poverty of Blood.
xVledicines had proved futile, and doctors
had failed. Then a piece of good fortune
happened to me. ‘Try Clement’s Tonic.’
These were the words of a friend. ‘ I’m
sure,’ she said, ‘it will do you some good.”*
“ You took this advice?”
“ I have congratulated myself ever since,
that I did, for in five days’ time the pain in
my bowels had completely gone, and my
head felt lighter and almost free from aches.
And how thankful I was to be able to eat a
bit of something again with an appetite.
Now that I knew
I was Gradually Improving-
I felt as though a heavy load was lifted off
ny mind. The days went by quickly and
hopefully, for I saw Clements Tonic
Was Renewing; my Vitality
and filling my veins once more with healthy
blood. The rest is a matter of course. I
had no relapse to weakness. I grew better
all the time. Something like my old health
and vigor returned. Many people are
astounded. They had seen me weak, ailing,
and pale for months and months past, and
now they beheld me up and about, cheerful,
smiling, and with a healthy colour in both
cheeks and lips. The way I pulled round,
was wonderful. My spirits were splendid.
I grew stouter daily, and it wasn’t long
befoie I could do the hardest work again—
work which 12 months before I had to give
up. My meals were, by the aid of Clements
Tonic, thoroughly digested, and I could say
with truth that
I was quite well and strong
again. The course of the
disease was slow and in-
sidious, the cure complete
and rapid.
And as you ask permission to publish my
statement I shall he only too pleased to
grant your request.”

You know by the years Clements Tonic has been the leading and only popular line, tby it
is the only one you can put trust in. See the eases it has cured, the reputation it has
gained, and then consider if it is worth your while to waste money uii perfectly useless

DR. MORSE’S INDIAN ROOT PILLS
CURE
Sick Sick Kidneys^-.
, and Female Ailments.
The Blood is the Life of the Flesh.—Leviticus xvii., 13, 14.
AS all diseases arise from impurities of the blood, it is needless to impress the public with the necessity, “if you desire health,” of keeping the blood pure and in a
healthy state. To accomplish this it is necessary, once in a while, to cleanse the system of the many impurities which gather in the blood. The simplest way to
do this is to avail yourself of a mild and healthful medicine, which, taken once in a while, will purify the blood and keep the system toned up. Such a medicine
we place before you in DR. MORSE’S INDIAN ROOT PILLS, manufactured from plants and roots which grow around the mountainous cl ills in Nature’s garden, for
the health and recovery of diseased man. One of the roots from which these Pills are made is a Sudorific, which opens the poi’es of the skin, and assists Nature in
throwing out the finer parts of the corruption within. The second is a plant which is an Expectorant, that opens and unclogs the passage to the lungs, and thus, in a
soothing manner, performs its duty by throwing off the phlegm and other humors from the lungs by copious spitting. The third is a Diuretic, which gives ease and double
strength to the kidneys ; thus encouraged, they draw large amounts of impurity from the blood, which is then thrown out bountifully by the urinary or water passage, and
which could not have been discharged in any other way. The fourth is a Cathartic, and accompanies the other properties of the Pills, while engaged in purifying the
blood ; the coarser particles of impurities which cannot pass by other outlets are thus taken up and conveyed ofl in great quantities by the bowels.
From the above it is shown that Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills not only enter the stomach, but become united with the blood, for they find their way to every part,
and completely rout out and cleanse the system from all impurity, and the life of the body, which is the blood, becomes perfectly healthy; consequently all sickness and
pain is driven from the system, for they cannot remain when the body becomes pure and clean.
. . . THEY CURE PERMANENTLY . . .
Dr. Morse’s Indian Hoot Pills are a positive cure for BILIOUSNESS, INDIGESTION, DYSPEPSIA, CONSTIPATION,
EOUL BHEATH, LIVER COMPLAINT, SALLOW COMPLEXION, SICK HEADACHE, KIDNEY TROUBLES, and
EEMALE AILMENTS; also a PERFECT BLOOD PURI FI PR, Curing SKIN DISEASE, such as Eczema, Pimples and Blotches.
Sold by Chemists and Storekeepers, price Is. l-|d. per bottle, or six bottles 6s. If unable to procure where you reside, The W. 11.
Comstock Co., Ltd., 58 Pitt-street, Sydney, will forward same upon receipt of price.

Nick Vedder’s Gold.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Old Nick Vedder trudged manfully down the
cliff-track to Strahan, picking his steps as one who
had travelled far and whose pack was heavy.
Morris, seeing him in the distance, awoke from
day dreams into a sudden interest. “ Here comes
old man Vedder again,” he said to a companion,
who sat in the doorway of the Cornucopia Hotel
gazing seaward. But the latter, after turning a
pair of blood-shot eyes in the direction of the new-
comer, looked out again between the points of the
bay and said nothing.
“If I could only track him down” began
Morris.
“ Bah ! ” impatiently said the other, who was
called Maori Jack, “it’s always the same cry.
Never a soft-headed old hatter can come down
from the ranges for tucker but you Strahan loafers
must have it that his swag’s full of nuggets.
There’s not an ounce of gold on the whole coast, I
tell you.”
“But he must be on to a good patch some-
where,” insisted Morris. “It was all a plant,
him showing us those pyrites specimens and pre-
tending to believe they were the genuine. He’s
not the looney you think, I’ll swear that. It’s all
a game to hide that he’s on good gold, and it’s a
game I’m going to take a hand in before long.”
But the other, with fine inconsequence, remarked
that they’d have a bit of wind behind them this
trip, and had better be going before it died. That
it would take them two hours good to get across
the harbor, anyway, and old Yedolph had got to
have his keg that night whatever happened. And
for the traders in illicit spirits, old Yedolph, pro-
prietor of the Cornucopia Hotel, Strahan, was a
person whose wishes were not lightly to be dis-
regarded.
* * * *
Morris, dozing in the bottom of the boat, heard
rough steps on the shingle, and, looking up, with
the blink of the slanting sun in his eyes, saw
Maori Jack and Lang, called the “ Butcher,” run-
ing across the foreshore to where the boat lay
beached. On their heels followed Christian, one of
the two local policemen, and the other was panting
lamentably in the rear as he jogged through the
pig-face scrub. Morris pushed the boat clear of
the beach, and stood waiting, ready to pole-off.
Maori Jack and Lang were over the thwarts in an
instant, but as the boat swung clear Christian
grasped the oar with which the boat was being
levered out into the tide-way. “Stop, Morris ! ”
he began, clapping hand to the pistol in his belt.
He did not finish the sentence, for Morris struck
at him with the heavy end of a broken oar, so
that he fell face-down wards in the seaweed.
A gust of wind filled the jib, and the boat edged
free of the kelpage out of the lee of the sloping
cliffs. But Maori Jack, with a pointing fore-
finger to the red stain that followed in its wake,
said, “My God, you’ve killed him ! I heard his
skull crack,” and sa-t down on the bottom of the
boat, moaning.
“ Haul in that —— mainsneet, can’t you ?” an-
swered Morris, savagely, “or we’ll have that
riddling us with shot-holes,” and he cried out
derisively to the other constable, who, after firing
a couple of ineffective shots, bent over the motion-
less figure that lay with the water lapping over it
in little waves.
And then, looking ovei at Maori Jack, still
crouched in the stern with his gaze bent to the
white trail that followed the keel, “You
cowards ! ” Morris said, in sudden rage. “ You’ll
swing for this as well as me,” answering the
horror that spoke in the others’ eyes.
The boat slowly made way across to where the
shadow of Heomskirk lay on Strahan, and the
harbor spread behind them a plate of silver
rippled with leaden lines that seared its surface
ever and again.
“ They caught us with the kegs cornin' up the
gully, ’’said the “Butcher, ’’thickly; “me an’Maori;
and Christian fired at us, an’ we run for the boat,
didn’t we, Maori.” But Maori Jack, speaking for
the first time since they had left the beach, cried
out, “My God! look there! ’’—still pointing
astern. There was a white spot over against
Dead Island, silhouetted on the dark background
of the squall that was heading towards them
across tli6 harbor.„ The police-boat was already on
its way to Strahan with the news.
* * ♦ *
The moon had risen in a ghastly redness when
they beached their boat near the mouth of Stock-
yard Creek, hiding her carefuly in the dense ti-tree
which was rooted well out into the water. “We
may want her again,” said Morris, “if” .
There was a grimness in the unfinished sentence
that sent the “ Butcher ” off into a nervous
oh uckle.
They got swags and tucker at Lang’s hut, and
then, crossing the button-grass, were lost in the
dark shadows that canopied the track. A couple
of miles out they cut the Hobart wire just five
minutes after a message had passed along that
barred every port in Tasmania to them, and sent
half-a-dozen mounted troopers, a few hours later,
jingling along the Linda track on their road to
Strahan.
The slopes of the Frenchman’s Cap are honey-
combed with caves, and in the dense scrub that
clothes the gullies running in to the base of the
mountain men in search of solitude might defy an
army of seekers. The refugees could afford to
laugh at the handful who were making ineffectual
efforts to discover their whereabouts. And, after
a space, this was realised, and the hunt was limited
to a patrol-party, that moved .up and down the
Linda track investigating the little district out-
rages this side of Arrowsmith—all laid to the dis-
credit of Morris and his gang of two.
* * * *
Worn out by exposure and scanty food, the out-
laws at last had to abandon their stronghold and
make a dash for freedom. Morris recognised the
grim necessity when he saw the other two whis-
pering apart, and read their furtive looks. There
were two chances ; one a traverse through the
forest, making to come out at the Huon below
Hobart; the other, to make for the mainland by
boat. Sailor Jack, a law-abiding scoundrel of
their acquaintance, had caused them to be in-
formed through one of their “ telegraphs ” that he
was willing, for a consideration, to let them have
their own boat some dark night at the Gordon
mouth. But they had no money, and Sailor Jack,
with unfeeling caution, insisted on a spot-cash
transaction. “By God, then, we’ll risk a dash
through Strahan and get the boat for our-
selves,” said Morris at the end of a weary debate,
cutting the knot of their difficulty.
And so it was that one evening they came to be
skulking along the Linda track where it takes a
bend to avoid a curl of the Collingwood River.
They had barely time to plunge into the under-
growth that belted the track, at the sound of
horses’ hoofs. A squad of troopers jingled by so
closely that Morris could with ease have picked
off any one of thorn with his drawn revolver;
and their careless talk came plainly to his ears.'
Another bend, and the troopers were gone.
But Morris, beyond the brushwood, had seen
a little spiral of smoke rising among the timber
at the foot of the gully. The three of them
scrambled down, and, after much reconnoitring,
found in the dusk of the myrtles a rough-built
hut. And in the doorway sat “ old man Vedder,”
smoking in silent contemplation, as if never’a
living thing were near beside the “popjockeys”
whistling in the underbrush, and the little ring-
tail ’possums that lived a friendly life in the
blackwood that bent over the hut-roof.
• * * *
Out of earshot, the three discussed the situation,
and came to the one possible decision. Vedder
must have provisions and might have gold, a few
ounces of which would enable them to purchase
Sailor Jack’s proffered co-operation.
Maori Jack kept watch amongst the ferns on a
little eminence outside the timber, while the
others stealthily approached the hut from the rear.
The crack of a branch over which Morris tripped
in the gloom betrayed them, and the hut-door
was hastily shut in their faces, but not before
Lang had put a foot over the threshold. With
his shoulders he burst his way in, to find himself
gripped in Vedder’s thin, nervy arms. As they
lay struggling on the floor, Morris pulled his revol-
ver from his pouch and fired into Vedder’s side.
His grasp on the other’s throat relaxed, and he
lay still, while a little red stream ran from under
his body and followed the angles of the rough
floor.
Lang offered little thanks for the assistance.
“ You fool ! ” he cried ; “ are you mad ? This’ll
bring the traps down on us,” and he edged to the
door, holding his shirt-sleeve to his throat, where
Vedder’s nails had torn great angry lacerations.
“Fill your tucker-bag,”ans vered Morris, laugh-
ing wildly, and himself continued to ransack every
corner of the room in eager haste, tearing down
shelves and overturning boxes in wild confusion.
There came the call of a mountain-thrush from
up the gully, and Morris whistled back the same
note. Lang made for the door with his swag.
“ They’ve heard that shot, damn you ! ” he said
as he went.
Morris, as a last chance, prised up the hearth-
stone, saw a little canvas-bag, grabbed it, and
rushed out after the others. At the crest above
there were three troopers running towards them,
not a hundred yards away. The ambuscade had
been successful.
* * • *
Morris followed his mate up a cut-off, cm ving
away from the track round the extreme verge of
the cliff. At a bend which hid him for the
moment from his pursuers, he seized a sapling,
swung himself over the edge, and lay quiet as the
troopers clattered by on foot, not noticing in the
darkness the scared white face that looked up at
them out of the bed of the fan-fern on the cliff-
edge. Morris lay motionless until, in the middle
distance, two shots rang out—the last, the quick
crack of a rifle. Then he slid down from rock to
rock, helped by the undergrowth that hid in the fis-
sures weather-worn into the smooth cliff-face, com-
passing such feats as would have tried stronger
nerves than his in fair daylight. Reaching the level
where the Broken Creek wound its way, he ran
along the open avenue of button-grass flat at the
edge of the creek till his breath failed him, and
then he lay panting, with the bag of gold still
inside the bosom of his shirt.
He had lost his matches, and could only ap-
praise his treasure roughly by weight. Light for
its bulk, he thought, but there must be 40 or 50
ounces. Fifty ounces—two hundred pounds ! His
breathing grew easier, and his lair smoother
as he fondled and caressed his bundle. It
was dear to him as life itself. It meant
life itself. Plenty of assistance to be bought
with the contents of this little bag. He
rejoiced that Lang—cursed, interfering fool—
was dead. The silence that followed the rifle-shot
meant that. Shot like a trapped dog, probably,
about a quarter of a mile on, where the track
blinded n into the cliff. Morris laughed to him-
self as he pictured the “Butcher”standing with his
back to the cliff up which he had no time to climb
by the rough step-notches cut in the face—perhaps,
if fear had made him brave, chancing the steep
descent, and pitching from rock to rock till he lay
a bundle of red flesh at the foot. Morris started
in alarm at the thought. If the “ Butcher ” had
done a jump, they’d follow him down, if not now,
then in t e morning. But he quickly reassured
himself. There would have been more rifle-shots
than the one that came to him. No, Lang—damn
him ! —-was dead on the cliff above, with a carbine
bullet in him. Good riddance !
Maori Jack had said that old man Vedder was
mad, and never was on gold. Maori Jack could
die, too—curse him !—so long as he was safe.
And then, from pure exhaustion, his brain ceased
to work, and he slept where he lay buried in the
ferns.
* * * *
In the morning he awoke and shook himself ;
and, with a sudden terror, as his memory came
back to him, put hand to side to feel if the bag was
secure. He opened it and poured out a couple of
ounces of the contents on a plate of bark. And
then, suddenly, as he played with his fingers
among the little heap of shining yellow that
gli-tened in the sun, newly breaking above the
Frenchman —with eyes dilated and a smile of con-
tent set on his features in ghastly petrifaction—he
plunged his hand into the bag and held the palm-
ful of metal to his eyes. Then, with maniacal
laughter, he rose and fled, holding tight in bis hand
the little canvas bag, while he climbed and climbed
like the lost traveller whose wits have left him in
the horror of the big bush. And ever and anon
came his horrid laugh, growing wilder and wilder
in the distance as the mountain sides bandied it
back and forth in quaintest echo.
The troopers wound their way back to Scrahan,
bearing among them a motionless burden on a
rudely-contrived litter. One of them had his
upper arm bound about with a bloody handker-
chief.
Sergeant Leggath, who was in advance, sud-
denly reined back his horse, and pointed dumbly
to a big granite boulder alongside the track.
Outlined against the dawn stood a figure
familiar, although the clothes hung upon it in
strips like the bark of a swamp myrtle. “Stand,
in the Queen’s name !” called the sergeant, loudly,
and a wild laugh and a revolver-shot came in an-
swer. A raw young private, who had been fin-
gering nervously at the trigger of his carbine,
sighted and pulled.
Morris stood for two seconds, and then plunged
heavily forward and lay still in the undergrowth
20 feet below, with one empty hand dabbling in
the current of the pool that washed the base of
the boulder.
Down the surface of the stream floated a torn
canvas-bag, to which there still adhered some
specks of yellow, glittering pyrites.

DOAN’S BACKACHE KIDNEY PILLS
—AND BRIGHT’S PISEAS€.^-
m
I
Bright’s Disease of the Kidneys cannot be cured. It is the most dangerous,
and the most fatal, of all diseases. It works slowly, secretly, and mysteriously.
It has some warning symptoms, but usually the patient attributes them to
some other cause than the kidneys. As the disease is little understood, we give
herewith some of the symptoms :
. Pain in the back and over the kidneys; hot, dry, and itching skin; unusual
desire to urinate; pain in passing water; urine small in quantity, but laden with
sediment; greasy froth in water; disordered eyesight; dizziness; sleeplessness;
irregular heart, debility, loss of weight; dropsy, &c.
If the symptoms be taken in time and treated with a good kidney medicine, it
will heal the diseased kidneys and ward off the disease. Do not neglect the warning
symptoms. Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills have been curing kidney troubles for
30 years. Will you test them ? Bead what a Sydney man says:—

A Woman’s Letter.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
How strove this feverish heart of mine
To melt that stony heart of thine
With passionate desire;
And, oh ! with such fierce ardour burned
This thwarted soul, it almost turned
As pitiless as fire.
You never knew—men never do,
We must be won and mastered, too;
And feel, however stinging,
The hasty words. There is a heart
Behind too big to take their part,
To which our own is clinging.
You never knew, with all your learning,
That woman’s heart is always yearning
For love that is as fire.
We must have gods, but not like you
Who are so passionlessly true
Of whom we soon should tire.
We dally with the flame, afraid,
Then singe our wings and drop dismayed
With an unending aching,
With shrivelled hopes and frightful fears.
And with—oh !—such suffering and tears
As set our poor hearts breaking.
You never knew that far within
Our souls we love what you call Sin,
And hate your idol —Duty ;
We praise your good men with a smile
Because it’s right, but all the while
We worship power and beauty.
You never knew that woman's heart
Is of all things things the strangest part
Of that you call the whole ;
With cat-like instincts and a will
To marshal them for good and ill
And switch them on a soul.
You never knew—great man of mind,
We love the man we cannot find
Or is beyond our reaches ;
And take on trust whate’er we can,
Provided it is like a man,
Then—battle for the breeches !
You never knew that, once subdued
By one great soul, we are imbued
With something that can tame us ;
We groom him up and feed his brains
And brisk him on with praise and reins
And drive him till he’s famous.
We are, dear me ! a strange, queer lot:
Some hardly worth an ounce of shot;
Some very weak and human ;
Some winging up so high you deem
They are not earthly—men do dream,
And some like me, a woman.
ARTHUR A. D. BAYLDON.
The Betrayal of Martin Carr
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The short winter day was merging into the night,
and a misty rain was dropping lazily. Neverthe-
less, a group of bare-headed women stood in the
light that shone through an open doorway, and
gossiped loudly and eagerly. A man approached
unheard, and stood listening a seeming giant
against the light behind him. Silence fell upon
th u women as they saw him, but the man passed
on without comment. The women watched his
great form dwindle through the heavy dusk into
the doorway of an adjacent house ; savv a light
flash and waver through the window ; and, after
an interval of darkness, the man, standing discon-
solate in the lighted doorway. With common
accord the women went to him.
“Martin Carr,” said one, stepping out from
the rest; “it’s sorry indeed I am for you this
night. But I knew it—l knew it would come to
this.”
The woman’s words seemed to rouse Carr from
a stupor.
“ What do you mean ? ” he asked, huskily.
The dirty, little, cross-eyed wasp !” the woman
went on, excitedly. “He was hanging around
here for the last two days, while you were away.
And this evening, late, they went that way-
together.”
Carr looked mechanically in the pointed direc-
tion ; then he went in, extinguished the light, and
came out again.
Without a word, and unheeding the others,
he started off towards the black outlines of scrub
towards which the woman had pointed. Hur-
riedly he had reasoned that those he sought would
make to the nearest railway town. He would
seek them there.
The short way was through the bush, over
rough hills and deep gullies ; but Carr thought
nothing of that. His blood was afire, and one
idea only dominated him—revenge. The night
had fallen, and the rain had dwindled into fog.
On the crest of the hill Carr turned and threw
a glance at the fog-blurred lights of the town.
Mentally, he was a- year younger. He had met
her—a fair, slight, vivacious woman—and he loved
her. She was a widow, she told him ; her husband
had died a few months after their marriage, and
the world was very cold and cruel. And he pitied
her—loved her—married her. The memory of
that time almost blotted out the present pain, but
realisation returned in an instant, and he went
forward. And through the night he blundered on
and on.
• * • *
A luminous tint in the grey wall to the east told
Carr that day was coming. The light extended
rapidly overhead, and to the north and west and
south he could dimly discern, through the drip-
ping foliage, that he stood on the verge of a preci-
pice, the depth of which was hidden by the fog.
A sullen, persistent roar, seemingly far below,
suggested a rushing torrent. He turned to skirt
the brink of the chasm, when a sudden gust of
wind dashed into his eyes a shower of icy drops
from an overhanging bough. The same wind
stirred the fog like a fleecy curtain; lifted it for
an almost imperceptible moment, and, ere it had
swung back, he had dashed the spray from his eyes
and sprung forward, with a triumphant cry. He
had found them : the fog had given them up ! In
that momentary glimpse Carr had seen them
standing on the brink of the precipice ; hesitating
like people who feared to move, waiting for the
fog to lift.
In another instant he was beside them. The
woman cowered as if she would flee ; then she
turned, and her arm went protectingly around the
cross-eyed man’s shoulder. The latter, with an
impatient movement, shook her off, and turned
his face, livid with cold and rage, to Carr. For a
full minute the three seemed to be listening to the
moaning of the water beneath ; then, with un-
spoken assent, the two men met, their faces white,
determined -for a death-battle. The little man’s
hands shot out and gripped Carr’s throat, and
they struggled backward and forward. Suddenly
Carr’s wife sprang forward with a warning cry—
Hiey were on the very edge of the chasm. But
Carr had seen his danger : with a supreme effort he
wrenched the hands from his throat, and recoiled
quickly. The little man lurched back ward—snapped
uselessly at the air with his hands—and vanished
in the fog. . . . Afar down there was the sound
of crackling brushwood, and the faint echo of a
splash leapt along the crags.
Carr, his face ashen as the enshrouding fog,
turned to the woman who was huddled on the
ground.
“ Who was he?’ he said savagely.
“My husband ! ” she wailed. “It was he who
was betrayed. We quarrelled, and I left him—
and married you. But he sought and found me,
and my love for him revived ”
But Carr had turned, and the fog had engulfed
him—and it never gave him up !
P. T. FREEMAN.
At a Broken Hill mine, recently, a night-
watchman caught a man stealing coal, and, as
said man wouldn’t “stand,” proceeded to take
pot shots at him with a revolver. This is his own
statement, yet up to now there is no word of this
dangerous person being arrested for shooting at a
person unknown with intent to do him bodily
harm. Some fine night a watchman will succeed
in mortally shooting a man who won’t wait to ex-
plain, when it is to be hoped a jury will bear in
mind that it is not a capital offence to decline to
be taken into custody by a private-watchman.
Iri a conversation which followed upon the
reading in Melbourne of a paper upon commer-
cial education, many original ideas were trotted
forth. Mr. E. Scarlett said that the ordinary
schoolboy bookkeeper was an unfortunate creature.
Also, that all the education in the world would
not make a smart buyer and seller. What was
wanted was technical education—the trained
mechanic was the foundation of the business of
the banker and the merchant. Mr. Geo. Bruce
said that good writing was the prime essential in
the boy who entered a merchant’s office. Given
good writing, and a knowledge of arithmetic
everything else would come to him—as, say'
language, knowledge of men, and manners, arid
national idiosyncrasies, etc. etc., not to speak of the
faculty of trained thought, just conclusions, and—
er—so on, you know. After all, what large,
heavy, clay feet these fetishes possess !
The hon. member for Turniptown (Banana-
land) is renowned for the length and sinuousness
of his Parliamentary career. Secret of his suc-
cess—a slavish devotion to the personal interests
of his pettifogging constituents. T’other day,
farmer Brown interviewed the legislator re a com-
plicated piece of land business. The elected of
Turniptown consulted Ministers, obtained legal
information, and, after a world of trouble and
some expense, set Brown’s business to rights.
Brown, gratefully : “ Well, Mr. Downybird, what
do I owe you?” “Owe me, Brown? Let’s see.
Well, call it tenpence for stamps, and the thing’s
square.” And the Brown vote is secure for the
next ten years.
A “Second-class Passenger” writes from
s.s. Barbarossa, near Aden, under date 26 March :
Dear Bulletin.— ln October, ’9B, a certain consumptive
shipped (apparently without official objection) on the
N.D. Lloyd’s s.s. Bremen for Australia ; but, not improv-
ing-, shipped back again (still without official objection)
on the Barbarossa. Got much worse on the passage, and
was informed day before arrival at Ceylon that he must
leave the boat there. As the man was known to be
almost penniless, passengers deputationised captain, but
patient was sent to Colombo Hospital, to be kept a month
at co.’s expense, and then sent on by next steamer— if
better, and if there were room (Prince Regent Luitpold’p
passenger-list reported full before Barbarossa left Syd-
ney). Passengers tried to see Sydney manager of co.
(first saloon passenger), but, oddly enough, he was
always sick, or having a bath, or otherwise engaged.
Evidently the ship’s doctor gave the patient less than a
month to live, but doctors often err, and if the unfor-
tunate young man survived, and the next boat were full,
what was to become of him—friendless and penniless in
a strange land ? Shipping co.’s reserve to themselves the
right of landing afflicted passengers, but the question is,
how far may they avail themselves of this privilege? I
had intended saying more, but perhaps I had better stop
here.
“ W.L.C.” to The Bulletin, from
Noumea: —
Capt. Pentecost (late of Lady St. Aubin) asserts that
“ 0.J.” (8., 11/2/’99) is much “out” about the finding of
the La Perouse relics, his Dad and Dillon notwithstand-
ing. Dillon never found any remains of La Perouse’s
ship, though, at an island some 100 miles to the S.E. of
where the navigator was wrecked, Dillon found a sword-
handle and part of a sword of French manufacture, and
embossed in gold. These articles had been taken there
and bartered ; the second item to serve the natives as a
gouge or chisel wherewith to hollow out their canoes,
which are here very large, and intended for long voyages.
Nothing else was ever found by Dillon, and it was reserved
for Capt. Wooden (after whom the Wooden canal, near
Noumea, was named) to find, in one of the passes of the
reef which surrounds the island of Vanikoro (scene of the
wreck), two of La Perouse’s cannons, an anchor, and
other things, which were brought to Noumea by the
French warship Bruat, some nine years ago. During
Dick Pentecost’s last two trips he found gold, silver, and
copper coins, lead and iron bullets, pieces of china, flint,
and old matchlocks, buried in the earth on the site where
the survivors of the ship’s company were supposed to
have constructed a small vessel from the debris of the
wreck, and Dick’s opinion is that this latter craft must
also have been wrecked on one of the numerous reefs
which lie between there and Torres Straits.
[Dillon first ascertained in 1826 how, when, and
where La Perouse was wrecked ; and solved the
36-years’ riddle. Who found most relics is a
secondary matter. —Ed. B.]

My son, whose picture I send you, was taken very sick, became languid,
losing his appetite and seeming to lose all energy. Apparently he did not have
hardly any life left in him. He was so weak he would become unconscious
at times. He also had large swellings in his neck. I was greatly worried
° Ver <i m " him to the doctors with no satisfactory results.
I then resorted to Ayer’s Sarsaparilla, remembering that my sister derived
a wonderful amount of good from this same medicine.
After a few days my boy’s health began to improve, his appetite returned,
and he gradually lost his extreme languidness. Ayer’s Sarsaparilla acted as a
giand tonic upon his whole system, and he soon began to scamper about like
other boys. I attribute his wonderful recovery solely to the fact that he took
Ayer’s Sarsaparilla and took it in time.”
This is the experience of Mrs. Arabella Graham (whose son’s portrait is given
above), of 73 Station St., Petersham, New South Wales. It is also the happy
experience of thousands of mothers all over the land. And it is the reason
why Ayer’s Sarsaparilla has been named
“The World’s Greatest Family Medicine.”
It brings color to white lips and plumpness to pale cheeks.
