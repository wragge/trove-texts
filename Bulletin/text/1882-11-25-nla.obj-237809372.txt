Io Poean!
Free selection is doomed. A law that has
plunged New South Wales into discord for twenty
years, that has embittered political and social
life, that has festered fraud and litigation, and
manacled honest enterprise, has met with its de-
served fata. Let there be no mistake as to the
significance of the vote given by a majority of the
Assembly on this question. The settlement of
population on the lands must be the chief aim of
every colonising community, bub bitterly-earned
experience has shewn the people that this end is
not to be attained by a policy that prompts fend
and faction among the settlers. Free selection
over most of the territory means social war.
Whare good results have followed its operation,
the same would have been attained more easily
under any other method of alienation, while the
evils which cry aloud over four-fifths of the co-
lony, have been the genuine fruits of the centre
principle embodied in the law.
• • •
It was this centre principle, its “ indiscriminate’ -
character, that carried Sir John Robertson s
bill in 1861. Tho avowed reason why that measure
was preferred to other plans put forward was the
right of reckless intrusion, encroachment, and in-
timidation, which it conferred on the selectors.
It cannot be claimed that Sir John Robertson
fought the battle of settlement against monopoly.
If his Act had not passed, another Alienation Ait
would certainly have become law. Other amd
better schemes were before the country, which
proposed to found settlement on orderly arrange-
• ments, framed with equal consideration for exist-
ing industry and permanent colonisation. The
plan of surveyed areas introduced then by Sir
John Hat, was close akin to the project of re-
form now adopted by Mr. Stuart and his party.
We congratulate the President of the Council
that he has lived to see the principle for which he
contended twenty-two years ago affirmed by a
majority of the Assembly.
• • •
No matter what political events may intervene
between this and the final adoption of a new land
law,' there can be no return to the condemned
policy. Unrest and a craving for something better
have been for months seething in the minds of the
people, as we have repeatedly pointed out. The
climax, as often happens in politics, came with a
rush. It is wonderful how the Reform polioy is
already in the air, influencing election speeches at
Gundagai, supplying a new text for hustings ad-
dresses, and bringing about many legislatorial con-
versions, some of which are seemingly miraculous.
It is only six weeks since the Land Reform Confer-
ence at the Town Hall passed a resolution condem-
natory of indiscriminate selection, when Mr. Hey-
PON tell upon his friends like another Assyrian, and
forced them to recant their heresy against the true
faith! Now Mr. Hetdon’s name figures in the list
of Opposition votes, among a goodly show of other
donverta. After all, there is nothing to criticise
in this. It is certain that dozens of the younger
members never knew much about the land question
before this memorable session, and there is no man
possessed of intelligence and candour but must
have been powerfully influenced by the flood of
logic and evidence poured upon the Act of 1861—
its author and his allies.
• • •
But Mr. Garrett’s action in this debate can by
no means bo covered by any such explanation.
There has been no more thorough-going supporter
of indiscriminate free-selection, with all its well-
proved abuses, than Thomas Garrett. Ihere
has been no Minister of Lands so able, and at the
same time who has done so much to discredit both
the law and its administration; and no land-agent
in the Assembly has been so much mixed up with
its chicanery. In 1875, Mr. Garrett said “ that
tio person whose opinion was worth listening to
wanted any serious change in the law. - ’ Every-
thing that is going on now, and that Mr. Garrett
condemns, was going on then. What special reve-
lation has shown him the true character of that
which he understood so thoroughly and praised so
highly seven years before? If Mr. Garrett has
seen new light, and, in his simplicity and candour,
avows it, all honour to him ! But his amendment
is so obviously the same scheme as that put for-
ward by Mr. Stuart that his action in taking a
(separate course from that gentleman and his party
BeemB a little eccentric. If straightforward land
reform is the aim of both politicians, they should
certainly, with projects so identical in principle,
be working together. Mr. Garrett knows land
matters well, bnt his qualifications as an ally are
problematical. There was an old Trojan once
who looked with great suspicion on the honest
professions and friendly gifts of the clever Greeks.
What be said we commend to the gentlemen who
may frame a new Land Bill, and also to Mr.
Garrett —“ Timeo Danaos et dona ferentes.”
• * i
The Parkes-Eobebtson Ministry leaves but a
ragged record. Professing great things to the'last,
and confident in the count of Its vassals and
followers, it has held power for the last two years
mainly through its command of an overflowing
Treasury. Road and Bridge jobs, Milbnrn Creek
and Day compensations have kept a working team
together fit enough tor fair weather; but the
challenge which the Government lay under to deal
with great questions could no longer be disre-
garded, and tho Land Bill was brought before a
critical, dissatisfied House. Some of the members
had not forgotten the Premier’s Pharisaical inter-
ference with the astronomical lectures given on
Sundays by Mr. Proctor; others remembered
hia arrogant attempts to curb the Press, and dic-
tate to the Legislative Council. Tho criminal
negligence of the Executive in trusting valuable
public records in a building constructed of timber
and paint, and the recklessness with which the
burning of the Garden Palace, involving a loss of
half-a-million of money, was treated, still rankled
in tho minds of many. Those Circular Wharf
complications pointed out by Mr. Gabvan, and of
which Mr. Watson had as yet evaded the ex-
planation, also added their quota to the disparage-
ment of the party in power. But all these prompt-
ings to dissatisfaction would not have availed to
move so strong a Government, if the mind of the i
country had not become imbued with distrust of p f
great deal that passed for gospel not very long
ago. A resolute band in the Assembly, backed
by an unseen but powerful phalanx outside, had
resolved that before this Parliament ended, there
would be an attempt to bring a decent land
system before the people of New South Wales,
and to introduce some scheme of local self-govern-
ment that would knock log rolling on the head,
and fasten the responsibility of expending public
money on those who got the good of it.
• • •
The honours, as well as the strength of the
debate, were entirely with the Opposition, The
speech of the Minister for Lands may have suited
banquet audiences well enough, but it only excited
ridicule among men whe had studied their subject.
Among other statements, equally valuable, Sir
John said that “ three-quarters of our territory
was upwards of three hundred miles from the
coast.’" A map and a scale will prove in five
minutes that only about one-third of this colony
is over three hundred miles from the coast. The
’line at that distance will run by Hay, Hillston,
the junction of the Macquarie and Bogan, and
between Brewarrina and Walgett to the (Queens-
land boundary. So much for the geographical
knowledge to be got in the “Lands.” The Per-
manent Head said once that he had nothing to do
with locality, and truly the Minister seemed
equally competent. This is sufficient to test the
value of the other “facts” cited by Sir John.
Mr. Stuart’s lucid and connected statement told
all the more powerfully after this leading oration.
Mr. O’Connor’s quotations from Sir Henry
Pabkes’ speeches had a damaging effect; but
that which brought on the crisis, and turned a
drawn fight into a complete rout, was tho tre-
mendous phillipio delivered by Mr. M'Elhone.
Whatever John M'Elhonb’s faults may havo
been, he did did good -work on the night of the
16th, and we are proud to congratulate him.
• , • *
Tho framing ?£ a new Bill will be a work re-
quiring no little consideration, patience, resolu-
* ' u n, and integrity. We believe that the essential
ciuU tk —- will be acceptable to the country
ar j contained in M». Stuart’s scheme, but much
detail is required before a workable measure can
be framed. A deal of misgovernment has arisen
from badly constructed and badly worked Acts,and
all hasty, “slummy” legislation is to be condemned
For instance, the division of the squ&ttages, the
central principle of the scheme, is a matter that
can hardly be carried into effect by publishing a
few notices in the Gazette, and Ihe practical ob-
ject aimed at in this division, the al ocation of the
two portions, unless very clearly defined and
firmly enforced, will only open a field for the re-
newal of old evils. To make this division effective,
as leading to the peace and security so much tote
desired, one half of the runs divided must be by
law made as completely proof against squatting
encroachment, as the other half is made proof
against selection. There are other difficulties that
are sure to start np. When the surveyed plans
of the stations, showing the alienated lands in
each, are produced, then a portion of the problem
to be dealt with will be apparent. It is to be re-
membered though, that the diffiouties to bo en-
countered are inevitable. They are the fruits of
a vicious polioy, which has endured for the best
part of a generation, and wo cannot have a clean
sheet to work on after the contusion and intrigue
which has been growing from year to year. More-
over, the longer the needful disentanglement is
left, the worse it will be. Whatever the difficulties
maep be, the power of Parliament can, if rightly
used, overcome them, and we predict that the
Ministry which tackles the work in good faith
will have tho hearty support of the country.
• . • •
The fact that His, Excellency the Governor has
yielded to the representations of Sir Henry
Pabkes and has granted a dissolution may sur-
prise many who remember the Vice-Regal methods
of four years ago. However, the||cirbumataBoe
affects not ©ne iota our forecast of the future, and
we will confess ourselves much misled if the elec-
tion now pending does not more than confirm the
verdict delivered by the Assembly on the 16th
instant.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Drink, and be Damned!
It is with tears of joy in our eyas that we record the
tact that the effete Esculapianism of a barbarous ago
must soon be wiped out. Doctors will disappear, and
doctor’s boys; and it will become a theme for the
persiflage of posterity that a generation could have
existed whiuh took different medicines for different
ailments. In that glorious time, gin will be the cure
for every sickneis. And all men will be sick in these
days. How do we know this ? Well, we have just now
under our band an advertisement addressed to females
which appears from time to time in a daily paper. It
is from a certain firm whese business lies with Intoxi-
cants. Here is an insinuating sentence which cannot
fail to fetch the female heart“ In lieu of consulting
the family physician, much trouble and inconvenience
could be saved by taking a simple prescription, which
is always feasible, and will always prove efficacious.”
In other words, ladies, drink this firm’s gin. If ycru
find a little does you no good, drink more. Drink a lot.
Get drunk. Go to bed with a gin-bottle under your
pillow. Take your coffee with gin. Put gin in the
baby’s feeding-bottle. There is nothing like gin. And,
when you have been divorced from your husband,
deserted by your children, and find yourself a blear-
eyed outcast in the streets, then yon will bless that
firm. Certainly you will have gone to perdition, hut
what of that P The gin business will boom when you
are in the dead-house. And the canvasser for that gin-
firm will go round and collect his commission from the
undertaker—who by that time will have wisely dissolved
his ancient alliance with the doctors for the newer and
more improved method of murder. Sling your medicine
out of the window, ladies. Drink gin and fce damned!
Lazarus.
Messieurs the Dead, arise ! Came out of your vaults
of oblivion, you poor old scarecrow politicians and
eminent rottennesses. You have eaten dirt, and are dirt,
but be not afraid. Lazarus is up, and walks about in
the sun. HE, who was dead, lives. He has with his
own hands rolled back the atone of scorn from his
sepulchre, and stalks around among the quick in native
shamelessness. We should not mind this, if he were
clever. We admire cleverness of any kind. But, when
a man is dull, and mean, and hypoeritical, we like to
see him stay in the grave. You can’t, however, dis-
courage an Earthworm by heaping dirt over him; and
you couldn’t discourage HIM if you were to pile the
Pelion] of his paltrinesses upon the Ossa of his offences,
and crowd the whole heap upon his head. The reason
of this is obvious. Sensitiveness and Ignorance never
go hand jin hand. A short time ago HIS name was
coupled with all that is contemptible in human nature.
Did that hurt his feelings—or, rather, we should say,
affeot his appetite ? Pshaw I He was, a few days after,
forecasting the future, as brazen-browed and brazeo-
tongued as ever. And he led one who wag supposed to
be a leader round by the nose, as a bear-master leads a
dancing bear, to caper before them all. We are begin-
ning to contuse identities. Is HE the bear ?—or, if not
is the bear still alive? We can’t believe that it was
anything but the spectra of a once able man thg,t
was conj used up by this vulgar sorcerer to play the
mountebank in the sight of those who at one time
credited him with common sense, if nothing more.
But everything is getting mixed. The only refuge for
virtue in these days is the gaol.

Miraculous Muok.
Bt a miraculous interposition of Divine Providence we
Lave been able to secure a copy of last week s Express.
There is such a rush made for that journal immediate.y
it comes out that it is only by the intercession of 8t.
Patrick, and the payment of threepence, in advance,
that it is possible to obtain one. We have so far sue
ceeded in getting three, which we have had framed as
rare curosities We like the Express, because its
paragraphs are so blamelessly blank, and its humour so
holy-waterish. There is usually some very interesting
information in it about Sister Bridget b visions and
Father Doolan'3 more practical, but not less holy,
collections for church-building. There Da very edify-
ing notice of a blessed little book by the “ Nun of Ken-
mare," in the last issue. The Nun mentions with satis-
faction that Murphy, of Tasmania, visited
Knock—the place where the ghost walks —to “thank
Almighty God and His Blessed Mother for the cure
effected to his eyes, by the use of some water in which
the Knock cement had been dissolved.” Wa are exceed-
ingly glad to hear that his Lordship s eyes are all right
again, and hope that when ha returns ho will bring a
cartload of, that esment with him. We would like to
try its effect on the eye of the needle through which
these camel clerics will have to enter Heaven, if what
He who never lied said is true. The writer of this sin-
ful paragraph has been in the Island of Saints
and has seen some of the holy wells and p’aces
of the kind where miraculous cures were performed.
The bushes all round these wells used to blossom with
old mgs and bandages which the “ lamethen” left
behind them as tokens of their recovery. But in the
interests of truth it must be stated, however sorrowful
the admission may be, that these lame pilgrims were a
sot of hollow old frauds. They used to beg their way
to the well, get cured of what never ailed them, hump
their crutches on their shoulders with prayerful joy
for some distance, and then mount them and hirple
away again on a begging tour to another well. It is welt
for 8t. Patrick that he is safely in heaven, for we doubt
that he would ever get there if he had lived till now
and had to stand responsible for all the lies that have
been told about him np to date. Fact is, the drama of
deception is played out for all but tbe foolish and the
mad. The augurs laugh at each other when they meet.
It is in vain—except for the coastituency we have
named, who will believe anything without this super,
fluous persuasion—that they write with the diction of
a Dcplanlocp or the fiery vehemence of a Veuillot.
Doubly in vain, because the majority of the class they
appeal to can’t read. The wheels of the world will roll
round just as they used to do if all the canonised night-
mares that ever lived were to hang on the spokes.
They will be hanged on the spokes—‘that s all. Still
we admit it is a blessed thing to eat good capon and
grow fat. But the capons won’t last for over. And
then—the deluge.
+
Fellow-electors, never consider whether or not a can-
didate for “ Municipal honours" is a liar, fraud, sneak,
thief, scoundrel, sanctified hypocrite,whited sepulchre,
and teetotal bummer, or not. Never ask yourselves
Whether a candidate would be likely to accept a bribe
and sell you like a bullock in Smithfleld. It doesn’t
matter to you that his tongue may be smooth, his face
like a benediction, and his soul—if indeed he has a
soai—an iridescent, putrescent, phosphorescent mass
of festering rot. These are not the questions for your
consideration. The real point is—what is your opinion
of the Battle of the Boyne and the Irish Rebellion of
“ ’93," and don’t you think that this young and as yet
free country would be improved if wo had a Battle of
the Boyne and aft Irish Rebillion in Sydney every
year P
Slavery is dead long ago. And hlackbirding is buried.
They only indulge in legitimate labour, traffic now a-
days. The Rockhampton Bulletin recently under-
stood that a large of Cingalese \fras
about to be landed on the Queensland coast. It
has “seen a letter from a gentleman largely in.
terested in their introduction," and that gentle-
man says; “I expect 400 men and 50 women to
arrive at Mackay, per Devonshire. ... I could
land them at Ksppel Bay at £20 a-head passage money,
£20 a year wages, no food, no clothing, and under a very
good agreement. No Government * ♦ I have
about 100 to spare; the balance are all ordered. The
Colonial Sugar Company, at Mackay, take 200, and 150
go to Bundaberg." Now, what is that naughty word
“ * • ’’ that has been suppressed ? Why shouldn’t we
call it slavery right out? We have seen how these
Cingalese got to Bundaberg.
Last Thursday the Weekly Shroud (the 32-page wind-
iag-sheet in which is hebdomadally wrapped part of the
contents of the Daily Rum and Ministerial Adulator)
jubilantly reprinted from its funereal “morning con-
temporary" au article labelled “The Strong Govern-
ment,” and siarnad by a moribund mule who calls him-
self “ Alpha Beta.” “ respite morning Trumpeters,
vespernal Sapphiras, and weekly Larrikins, the Govern-
ment is still Strong—blessed for ever be the name of
the Government! " yowled the corpse aforesaid. Poor
cadavre.l The very same night the “ Strong " Govern,
mant was dead ’Twas ever 83. Directly The Bum
advocates anything or anybody, that thing or that
person is doomed. The King-street exiles never
had a dear gazelle that didn’t roll its pretty lan-
guishing eyee about in all the agonies of colic
as soon as they commenced to stroke it. The Milner-
Stephin red-flannel gazelle went bung in one act, the
Protection gazelle get sick, the Kenny-hill gazelle is
dead, and now the Government gazelle has gone stiff.
The John Davies and Andersen College gazelles are
shaky, and a lot of other King-street antelopes have
iravelled up gum trees. Like the Echo, we want to
know to what extent the Parkbs-Robbrtson Ministry
(the “Strong” Government, be it noted, which with-
drew the Treasury ads. from the By eking Nbws be-
cause that journal straightforwardly criticised its
actions) has prsppel np the Rum by way of advertise-
ments ?
♦
One more wriggle in the Snrke Ministry. Defeated
by a thumping majority on the enly piece of real Go-
vernment policy produced during the session, they
have had little difficulty in persuading Gussy (who
knows more about fowls than about constitutional law)
to give them a possible lo-jfkole of escape from peliti-
cal de (traction. Thtir little game is:—Go to the coun-
try ou side issues, Parkes v. Archbishop Vaughan ;
Robertson v. the Squatters; the Kiama Ghost to be
resurrected, and the land question to be smothered, if
possible. You’ll see!
“An honest man,” acoirding to the latest
American definition, “ is the infernal rascal that will
stay bought.’*

POLITICAL POINTS.
The hidden terror of tyrants—" underground
engineering," but of a more terrible eort ’ban the grab
game of which the C M Q. is so accomplished an expert
-is rearing its crest again. Every centre of population
in Russia is once more in active ferment with Nihilistic
tendencies. Socialism has taken a volcanic spasm in
Prance. Hundreds of placards have suddenly and nays,
teriously been posted up in Paris and Marseilles. The
maihine-y at, the disposal of the organization appears
to be capable of the swiftest and most secret action.
All was quiet security ; suddenly all is undefined appre-
hension. The placards breathe of dynamite, infernal
machines, the bullet and the dagger. The cry is for
Socialistic concessions. Palling these, are to be hurled
the thunderbolts of an invisible ramification, every com-
ponent atom cf which is pledged to secret, sudden, and
almost indiscriminate murder.
Mr. J. G. O’Connor is going to contest Gun-
man We are glad of this, for since J G. got put out
of it, political life has lacked the tone which only the
presence of an illustrious politician caa impart to it.
Mr. O’Connor is now passing familiar with electioneer-
ing He has been bp for nearly every constituency
except Jamberoo, and his skill at getting first at the
wrong end of the poll has been phenomenal. Mr.
(/Connor, however, has a Rood show at last—should
everybody else retire. And, it may bo truly urged, that
be ha® many qualifications for the post of a representa-
tive of the country. It is on record ia the Parlia-
mentary refreshment - room that J Q. has a
a flow of language superior to that of the late Mr.
Hurley, who was not the Hurley for Hartley. Mr.
O'Connor will, of course, be received by many distm-
gnished residents, “ some in buggies and some on horse-
pack:” he will address enthusiastic meetings of the
free and independent; he will receive liberal promise s
of support, and—he will come back on his little pink
ear. Just see, now. fJ.G. now announces that he’s not
going up.]
In his financial statement, Mr. Watson said that
it was intended to increase the salaries of all profes-
sional officers, “ in every branch of tho department,
by 12* per cent.; bnt in the estimates which ho laid on
the table, the it crease is shown only in the cases cf
surveyors and lands office draughtsmen. It is stated that
the Government had actually agreed to increase salaries
all round 12* per cent., and that, by some means this be
came known in the Survey Office, whereupon the pro-
fessionals there resolved that if they did not have an
increase above that to be given to non-professionals,
they would resign in a body. No doubt some one
will be called upon to explain why a few professionals
in one department should be selected for increased pay.
Tbe remedy for this unsatisfactory state of things is a
Civil Service Act, but we shall not have such a law until
such time as there is nothing left to “ grab," and mem-
bers of Parliament can devote their attention to useful
legislature.
A Vice-Eegal log-rolling soandal over in South
Australia. There has been a rivalry between Strath,
albyn and Mount Barker as to ihe route the Inter-
colonial Railway—for so the proposed extension from
Nairna to the Victorian Border is locally called—shall
tako. The estimate by the departmental route was
£275 001), when it is suddenly ** understood ” that Sir
William Jervois, tho Governor, has “privately” ex-
tra) sed approval of another route, and given his
opinion that it could be done for £100,010. Mr. Stirling
—the R. B Smith of S.A.—one of the members for
Mount Barker, became a warm convert to the new idea;
when, lot the Mount Barker Courier made the un-
happy discovery that his Excellency had an estate near
Wellington (S A ) that would be greatly benefited by
tho diversion. Says the Courier: “If tho possesion
of a few acres of land is to render onr responsible
Governor a partizan, tbe fO'ner a law is passed by
which he is deprived of the privilege of becoming a
holder of land in the colony, the better both for hie
r«p.it»*ioa and the honour.and profit of South Aus-
tralia."
Mr. W. B Christie, the author of the well-known
pamphlet, “Our Land Laws,” was mentioned as likely to
oiler himself as a candidate for a southern constituency.
Mr. Christie’s writings show that he would be a valu-
able member at the present juncture. There is little
likelihood that the question of Land Reform will be
shelved in the present temper of the people, even
though the Government do carry their Amending Act.
The view* put forward in the pamphlet point in the
same direction as the policy which the Opposition has
adopted, and the experience of a practical surveyor,
combined with an evident ability to grasp economic
qnestions. saould make the writer a stout ally in the
times of conflict coming. We’d like to see Mr. Christie
elected to ithe Assembly. Wo have not the
pleasure of his personal acquaintance, bat we have
seen and heard enough of him to knew that he’s a game
man, who has the pluck to say what he means under
all circumstances. Physically, he would face his
weight in wild cats, while tho moral oonrage and acumen
shown by him in his long battle with the Lands De-
partment stamp him as a man not only of the most
indomitable energy, but as possessing ability of a
very rare order.
FACT AND FANCY FOCUSSED.
The terror of Bowen (N.Q,) was a blackfellow
known as “ Murdering Harry." He used to breathe
murder A warrant was mads ont for his arrest, bat,
in the meantime he made a ferocious attempt to kill a
son of Mr. Bradley, of Mount Dryander. binding it

him as dead as the “ Strong Government." Eiiza

“ Breeze” gave birch prematurely to a sixth child. Be-
coming feverish and delicious, she wound up her suffer-

it splinter and fly off like the Western, but it affords that domestic desideratum of some kinds of English coal of
heating an iron or cooking a steak as thoroughly and cleanly as a charcoal or breeze fire, while it imparts to the
steak none of that disagreeable odour of the unwholesome fumes given off by a breeze or gas fire.

PERSONAL ITEMS.
It is not known that Mrs. Langtry ever “ gilds
refined gold," but t here are times when she undoubtedly
“ paints the Lily.”
It’s positively dangerous to ask any member of
the “ victorious Australian Eleven" whether he knows
Dr. M’Grew, of Honolulu.
Poet Sladen has, wa hear, been appointed lec-
turer on English literature and belles-lettres in the
University of Sydney. "And preserved milk seemed
to agree with it." Amen.
It is rumoured that Sir James Martin intends
applying for a year's leave of absence. Sir James has,
we believe, never yet been in England. We are not very
sure that he has even been in Melbourne.
A representative of The Sportsman (Lon-
don! has come with the Hon. Ivo Bligh’s team, to
report the matches for his journal—which is, we
believe, the only daily sporting paper in the world.
People in Adelaide this last hot Thursday con-
gratulated the late William Townsend’s friends on the
faet that he had indubitably escaped an extra scorching
summer; but his friends do not reel eertain that this is
a decided advantage.
Sir Garnet Wolseley is now or is about to become
a baron, and is probably on the high road to a field-
marshal's baton. Vet, in 1854, he was eating out his
heart in a Dublin solicitor’s office, and waiting almost
hopelessly for the commission which it seemed would
never arrive I
A certain parson, in another colony, who is trying
to bring himself into prominence in connection with the
C. D. Bill discussion, was formerly a journeyman baker
and is believed to have derived most of his present en-
thusiasm in connection with the subject from a little
occurrence whioh took place in the city long ago.
The Australian Eleven sailed for New York
from England by the s.s. Alaska, " the greyhound of
the Atlantic," on 30th September, Mrs, Langtry
left by the Arizona, on 13th October. What a treat
was lost by the dear woman 1 Beautiful Murdoch,
lovely Maisie, ineffable Spoil, I
The elder Studd, as (at Adelaide) he quietly
allowed a hard-cut ball to travel through bis legs for
four, remarked that he still must be ** C.T." Yet
Studd managed to bowl a wicket—whereon it was re-
membered that, before leaving Ensrland, he had seen
Henry Irving, whioh accounted for the Mys-Terry.
A private of the 1st Life Guards came in, after
the charge at Knssassin, with a nasty sabre cut aeross
h»s left arm. Respecting this wound, the following
conversation was heard to ensue : —" Why, Bill, how
did you get that ?" " Well, you see, I got off my ’orse
to take one o’ these Harabi prisoner, and blesied it the
begger didn’t up with his oheese-knife and give me this
’ere slice 1" “ Well, what did yon do ?" " Well, I drew
my sword, and I halved the beggar 1"
Qf Henry Lemon, second son of the late Mr.
Mark Lemon, of Punch celebrity, who died at Mel-
bourne on the 13th of July, aged 37, a home paper says i
“A year or two before his father’s death, Harry
Lemon’s prospects were unnsua'lv bright. Ha had
written successful farces, and could turn his hand to
almost any literary or journalistic work. When the
editor of Punch travelled in the country with his
•Palstaff’ entertainment, about 1868 9, Harry Lemon
accompanied him and often * went on,’ cither as Bar-
dolph or as a ‘ superMr. Herbert Crellin (Standing)
playing Prince Hal, and Miss Rose Garland being the
leading lady."
Judge Docker once remarked that from hia
knowledge of phrenological and’physiognomical indica-
tions he was enabled to say whether the witness was
telling the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the
truth, or simply letting off some “cablegrams.” In
spite of his profound learning, however, be was neatly
"had" np Bonrke way. In adjourning the court for
luncheon, he told the juryman he wished them to cut
their repast as short as possible, and he would expect
to see them balk in half-an-honr. And the only person
who did not tnrn np in the time allotted was the Jndge
himself. Someone stole his bat 1 But the jurymen
knew nothing of it.
Professor Esmarch, the famous German snrgeom
attributes the late President Garfield’s death to the
loose way the antiseptic treatment was applied, and the
nnneces°ary searching after the bullet. Meanwhile,
Dr. D W. Bliss, who attended Garfield, is wrangling
with the United Slates Board of Audit over his claim
lor §25,000, which he thinks would only moderately
repay him for the breaking np of his private practice
and the’long-continued strain on his nerves'and strength
consequent on his close attendance at the President’s
bedside. By the way, Garfield, and Mrs. Garfield, are
now nearly forgotten in the States.
Everyone remembers the last flash of Swift’s
mighty intellect before it sank for ever into darkness—
" Here stands a proof of Irish sense,
Here Irish wit is seen;
When nothing’s left that’s worth defence
They build a magazine."
This reminds “ Atlas " that Mr. Gray, being hard and
fast in prison at Dublin, was, the other day, presented
with the freedom of six other towns by those marvellous
countrymen of hie. Ns better bull than this has been
made since David Buchanan and other admirers of
Henri Rochefort presented the distinguished French-
man with a walking-stick, in Sydney, as a token of their
admiration. By the way. Dr. Lang mixed himself np
in the affair, on the ground that Rochefort was in
favour of pulling down all convents.
The husband of the Baroness Bnrdett-Coutts has
undergone ns many changes of nomenclature as certain
rarelplanta which are named by every botanist who comes
across them. He was know to his Highgate school-
fellows as Bartlett, and to his contemporaries at Kable
as Ashmead-Bartlett. Since then he has blossomed out
into Coutts-Bartlett. then Bartlett-Ccutts, and now
into the full blown Burdett-Coutts. Ho really ought
to go down to posterity in the new Plutarch as a
parallel with that hereof "Rejected Addresses," who
has realised in fame the poet’s wish, " Long may
Long-Tillesley-Wellesley-Long-Pole live.” The modern
chameleon, however, as is natural with the progress of
civilisation, has outstripped his rival. His proper
name, it everyone had his rights, would run, we believe,
william Lehman - Ashmead - Bartlett-Coutts-Bactlett-
Bat tlettrContts-Burdett-Contts.
A curious romance is interwoven with the history
of Mr. Gray, the lately imprisoned editor of the Dublin
Fep.eman. While very young, at a sea-coast
town, a terrific storm wrecked a passenge* vessel, and
bo boat dared put off to her assistance. Young Grav
tied a line roand his body, and plunged through the
serf to what everyone regarded os certain death.
However, he reached the sinking ship, and one by one
all on board were saved. Among those who witnessed
the act was a girl, young, beautiful, and an heiress.
She is now Mrs. Gray, and, if report is truth, the
heroic young swimmer did not do all the courting.
He received the Gold Medal of the Royal Humane
Society, and hia own talents and his wife’s wealth
placed him in one of the most luxurious homes in the
Irish capital. Her name is known in the colonies.
She is the daughter of the ".Emigrant’s Friend," Mrs.
Chisholm.
ARABI.
If correct yourself you’d see.
Do not call him Arab!.
The Echo boys are wrong who cry,
*’ Suicide of Arabi! "
It’s only an ignorant sort of a gaby
Who’d fancy the name was a bit like Arabi.
Nor can it be right to exclaim " 0 how shabby
A fellow’s the fellow we know as Arabi 1 ”
H you would as right, say, as Arabi’s Pa be,
Pronounce it as though it were written Arab hi.
One of the most magnificent residences in Bast
Melbourne is that of; a well-known, er, •* financier,"
Jho put his house at the disposal of our sporting
Governor when he went down South. The eminent
Hebrew, however generous and disinterested he may
he towards gay members of the Civil Service, was not
Permitted te pose as the benevolent patron of vioe-
royaity, for Sir Hercules insisted on paying for all he
got. All the rooms in this house are splendid, but the
ballroom a (for there are twe) especially so. The first
W decorated truly aesthetically iu dark brown and pro-
fuse old gold; a brilliant chandelier, gorgeous amber
tones, a rich dado of tropical leaves, and a ceiling that
alone took six weeks to prepare, are its features. Open-
ing through an archway is the second j walla and ceiling
pure while, but hung with a bewildering array of beauti-
ful oil paintings, sumptuously framed—festoons of red
curtains at the doors. Among the pictures are several
groups of a certain bowling team, and in the centre of
e'ch is the face of the eminent, er, financier himself.
His preBence;there is significant.
The story of the Russian actress, Mademoiselle
Feyghine, is just such as can be read in almost any of
Onida’s novels. She possessed wonderful beauty, bnt
no genius, and proved a failure on the stage. Then
came the usual whispers in her ear that beauty was
more marketable than genlns : the Duo de Morny whis-
pered it more seductively than the rest, and he became
her "protector.” He did not love her, bat was proud
to parade the splendid young beauty among his friends.
He did not mind her even loving him for a time ; but it
got to be tiresome at last, and he loft her. Nobody
blamed him; for society is very gentle to wealthy noble-
men who tire of actresses they have *• protected." She
made a final appeal. Coming home to his apartments
one night, ho found her waiting for him; they chatted
for two hours, and he advised her to go home. Then,
as she seemed disinclined to go, he got into his bath,
and she stood before the looking-glass, said “Good-
night,” and pulled the trigger.
Bernhardt is terribly jealous of her new hus-
band, whom marriage has not entirely cured of a passion
for flirting. She keeps a close eye upon his movements,
and is never comfortable when he is out of her sight.
During her stage performances the very thought that
her attractive lord and master is engaged in " mashing ”
some of the footlight beauties behind the wings drives
her nearly distracted. At Blackpool recently, where an
immense andienoe had assembled to see her in
" Camille,” she refused after the first act to play any
longer. She alleged sickness as the reason for this
sadden whim, ana pointed to the blood whieh she was
raising from her lungs with a violent attack of cough-
ing as a proof of it. It was shrewdly surmised, how-
ever, that the blood was merely " stage blood,” whioh
Sarah had used with realistic effects, and it was after-
wards discovered that her jealousy was the real reason
of her refusal to continue the play. She had detected
Damala in a new flirtation, and oonld not remain on
the stage while he was out of her sight. If she doesn’t
shoot or poison this flekle benedict before very long, or
kill off herself or every beauty whom ho is likely to
admire, she will not be true to the traditions of the
disappointed actresses of the French stage.
Professor Gilbert, the lecturer on * Sexual
Philosophy," has run his head against a stone wall in
trying on a libel suit against the Maryborough (Q.)
Chronicle. Gilbert lectured three times on one of his
stock subjects—"Amativenose; its uses and abuses "—
and had, of conrse, crowded audiences. The Mary,
borough Chronicle stood out from the rest of the
Press, and walked into Gilbert, stigmatising his dis-
course as the incarnation of beastliness, and calling the
Professor a designing quack. Another Queensland
paper—need we say Thady O’ Kane’s Northern Miner ?
—republished she Maryborough Chronicle’s article,
and then received a vigoroaa denial from Professor
Gilbert, whose letter Thady also published. Gilbert
was virtuously sore. He stated that his lectures had
been applauded everywhere until the Maryborough
Chronicle abused him, and that every statement in
that article reflecting on him was absolutely false. He
pointed triumphantly to ihe (alleged) fact that “ Sir
John Robertson and others in high official positions in
New South Wales’ had given him letters of introduction
to prominent Qneenslanders. He weeps worst over the
article in this sentence: —“ If I were the lowest, most
vile and abandoned vagabond that sleeps in the gutter
I could scarcely have exceeded the meanness imputed
to me in that article in charging me with being the in-
strument of Drs. Bottrell and Elliot in the distribution
of a pamphlet gotten out and distributed to advertise a
quaok practice utterly at war with my teaching and
business." And the Professor sought the balm of £5000
for hia aspersed reputation. Bnt it appears that
Queensland can master a sensible libel jury. The men
ohesen to decide the cause held that the Chronicle’s
article was " a fair comment, and that it was true.” 80
a verdict was recorded for the defendant, and the Pro-
fessor may probably amnsa himself by paying the
Chronicle’s law costs—if he’s got any money. We
wonder whether he will take the projected Northern
tour still P If he docs, it will be a big boom. We advise
Professor [Gilbert to take out his next libel writ in
N.S W.
The Tasmanian cause ceUhre —Smith v. Smith
and Oellibrand—will probably be dragged through the
public proceedings of the Hobart Supremo Court after
all. Its quasi-settlement has broken down on an impor-
tant point, as will bo seen from the following summary
of the whole history of the case. The plaintiff is Mrs.
James Smith, wife of a leading barrister of Dunedin,
N.Z. The defendants are Sir Francis Smith (Chief
Justice of Tasmania, and bar husband's brother), and
Mr. W. St. Paul Oellibrand (her own brother). Her
father was the first Attorney-General of Tasmania (then
Van Diemen’s Land), and was noted as a Victorian ex-
plorer. _ Before leaving Tasmania on his last exploring
expedition, old Mr. Gellibrand made a will dividing his
property equally between his eight children. He was
lost in the bush, and never beard of again. When Miss
Louisa Gellibrand married, her legacy had accumulated
to about £5000, and, as hinted above, her brother and
brother in-law were made trustees under her marriage
settlement. Domestic differences occurred between
Mr. and Mrs. James Smith, and in 1878 the latter visited
Hobart and sought particulars as to her marriage settle-
ment from her trustees. Not being satisfied, she placed
the matter in the hands of her solicitor, between whom
and Sir Francis Smith correspondence ensued. In one
letter, Sir Francis stated that to insinuate that Mrs.
Smith was kept in ignorance of her rights was a
gratuitous insult, "for the ingenuity of malice could
not suggest a rational motive for such villainy," and
wound up with a bombastic challenge to take the ease
into a " court of justice, where these calumnies shall be
brought into daylight, and dissipated by open investi-
gation.” This correspondence was printed and circu-
lated privately in Hobart, Melbourne, Dunedin, and
other Australian cities—it not by, at any rate, with the
knowledge of, Sir Francis Smith. Mrs. James Smith
did take the case into court, and obtained a hearing on
1st May last, before Mr. Justice Dobson. The case was,
however, compromised by the defendants agreeing to
pay £6000, with £1700 costs; also Sir Francis withdrew
all offensive or hurtful expressions; the defendants
farther guaranteed tho release by Mr. Jamas Smith of
hia life interest in the trust funds of the marriage settle-
ment and agreed that new trustees should be appointed.
The hitch has occurred just here—the new trustees
refuse to not, and Mrs. James Smith won’t touch any
of the £6000 paid until accounts are famished, And
the defendants don’t seem in a hurry to furnish them.
It is worthy ef remark that, in a similar suit. Sir Francis
Smith himself, as Chief Justice, ruled that accounts
must be furnished to new trustees and to a plaintiff.
The Hon. Ivo Bligh’s team of English cricketers
did not want to land at Adelaide, feeling quite out of
match-form. But an anxious local committee prevailed
and (literally) dragged the Englishmen to the Oval.
Parts of a game were played there last Friday and
Saturday, but it would be manifestly absurd to dogma-
tise as to the quality of this team from anything then
done. One thing is felt to be pretty certain. They are
altogether free from the priggishness whioh character-
ised Lord Harris’ band of noble snobs. The Adelaide
Cricketing Association disregarded the request made
by Mr. Biigh’s representative and inaisted on playing
fifteen —a great mistake, as eleven local men
would have made quite as good a show. Then,
against their will, the match was forced on them. Yet,
personal considerations were forgotten by the Eleven,
who were, in some cases, physically unfit, and suffering
from the effects of eight weeks aboard the Peshawar
and of her unfortunate collision with the Qlenroy. They
are a genial gentlemanly tet of men, who pat no “ haw.
haw ” airs on, and who oan play cricket. Rich bache-
lors are included in the team, Mr. Tyleoote, it is
rumoured, being worth many score thousands yearly
He is a fidgety, free bat, who plays the ball eight times
out of twelve three feet outside the crease. G. B.
Studd is a fine wristy bat who plays what may bo termed
a quietly brilliant game. W. W. Read (beloved old
"Stout," how art thou ?) is a strong determined bats-
man, and puts about fourteen-stone on the kali every
time it reaches his bat. He is a good jndge of the
game, and a nice outfield. C. T. Stndd bowls for a
change—the high old trash with an occasional good one
for whioh the Gentlemen of Eugland have made them-
selves so famous. His batting was a disappoint-
ment, but then he was a long way out of
trim, and will, no doubt, make bettor scores
on good wickets. A. G. Steel is a stout-hearted little j
player, who fields well, and bowls a ball whioh some-
times hangs, sometimes breaks, is sometimes low and
fast, and sometimes high and slow. He is possibly the
best all-round man of the team. E. F. S. Tylecote (how
are the "seven,” dear boy?) captained the team for
Mr. Bligh. Tyleoote’s batting we have touched upon.
His wicket-keeping is good for an English amateur,and
he took Morloy’s fast deliveries pluekily, and "played
the camel” with the ball after the most approved
fashion, whipping off bails on the slightest prsvooation,
and wanting us to believe him another Blaokham —
which he is not I He is a liberal sonl, is “ Tylie"—
thin, dark, mnoh-shaven, and handsome, and affable as
the poorest pressman. Leslie is a sturdy hard-hitting
blonde. G. F. Vernon (George, dost then remember
Elian?) is another confoundedly well-off and good-
looking fellow. Ho is the field of the t*am, and a re-
doubtable run-getter, having done the M.C.C. and every
club for whioh he haa played good service ever since he
could handle a bat. Fooling about at Colombo, Vernon
strained one knee, and, therefore, is disadvantaged to
start with. The Hon. Ivo Bligh is built and mons-
taohed after the Lord Harris pattern. Bat he is
younger, and does not think himself better than the
ordinary cultured gentleman, and looks quite interest-
ing with his poor Hand slung in a beautiful dark-bine
silk handkerchief. Fred Morley is the bowler of the
team, and undoubtedly the best fast bewler England
owns just now. He bowls right over, breaks a little
across, puts every muscle into his work, has great
speed, is nearly always straight, and when the wicket
will obligingly “ bite ’’ a bit, is too much for mediocre,
and even good, batsmen. But Fred suffered terribly
from that collision, complains of nausea, and feels that
the "devil" has probably gone out of his bowling at
present. Barlow and Bates we had before. Barnes
is a fair change, Ulyett-like bowler, and blocky
bnt vigorous professional stylo bat. The team have a
good opinion of Qnilty’s and Jones’ bowling—both left-
hand, young, ana, in the ease of Qnilty, not too strong.
Qailty bowls naturally a most dangerous ball full of
■pin and curl, bnt is shaky as to length and judgment.
Jones is much faster—more d la Morley and particularly
pleased Steel, whom he bowled quickly enough. To
sum up, the Hon. Ivo Bligh’s Eleven should make
heavy scores, being very capable indeed as lo batting.
There are soma glorious fieldsmen among the number,
but, except Morley, they do not seem to have a bowler
really to be reokoned of the first class. A. G. Steel is
all very well when viewed through the medium of
toadying English criticisms, but A. G. Steel, on an
Australian cricket-field before an impartial crowd, may-
be found wanting. Of course we do not say he “ will ”
be, wo say he “ may ” be. Why should wa not, like
every strategist, reserve a line of retreat ? Had the
dry weather continued on Friday, the Eleven would
have been all out for about 70. The rain was entirely
in their favour, and took the sting ont of Quilty’s
bowling. On the Saturday, the South Australian
fielding was execrable, and must be debited with a large
proportion of the runs mode. However, bv the time
Sydneyites see them, Mr. Bligh’s hand may be
healed, Vernon’s leg sound again, Tyleoote’s weakness
bmiahed.ond Morley's stomach equal even to "she-oak.”

There was a very considerable flatter at the
Opera House on Monday evening. The great Aus-
tralian Eleven were there, and that was the reason why
the attendants wore clean collars and the side boxes
were bedecked with flowers and festoons The dear
boys, solemnly majestic in “ full black’’ arrived late—
of course that’s the way how things are done on the
“Continong"—and the genial Caron had to knock tne
orchtstra off in the middle of a 1 eautifnl funereal tune,
and strike up ” Seethe Conquering," &o., forte possible.
Murdoch, whose hair was “ laid out” in the highest
style of art, Black ham, the gentle Percy, the giant
Bonnor, and the insinuating Beale—lovely Charlie, he s
balder than our attempt to get a simile for baldness—
arcove first, and took their places in the prompt box.
The other members of the team, who had probably re-
mained at the hotel to clean their boots or to say their
prayers, shuffled in some time afterward*, and perched
themselves on the oppposite box. Sammy Jones'
father, Mr. Phil £heridan, Mr Gibson, Monte Faithful!,
the gentleman who sells the lemonade at the Associa-
tion Ground, and other cricketing celebrities were in
the dress circle Soon after the curtain had dropped
at the finish of the first act, the fair Emelie came be-
fore the footlights, and bowing la Dan O’Connor—Dam
must really have learnt his bow from Eme.ie—began to
read an address, which had been written for her on
three largo sheets of foolscap. There were no frantic
cries tor the writer of the address, and we are thus led
to believe that the gifted E. Lewis Scott had tossed off
the precious trifle at his leisure. Captain Murdoch
and his team remained seated the whole time Miss Melville
was reading the address, and it was only when
the gifted lady had retired, and the pit ho wled hideously
for “ Billy Merdick,” that the gentleman so honoured
rose for an instant from his cane-bottomed five-bobber
and acknowledged the compliment.

The Clara Stephenson company have been play-
ing in Townsville lately. The vivacious Vivians ar#
with them. Business is brisk, and enthusiasm eaer-
moos. A Townsville critic describes Miss Stephenson
as “ one of thu greatest actresses we have ever had up
North I” Haa he so soon forgotten Teresa? Inoon-
sistent sorlbe. “Every member of the company,’’ he
goes on to say, ia *• strong" ia his or her own partieu-
lar line. Thiols a dreadfully ambiguous sentence.

r Pollard’a Juveniles have got home again.
Mademoiselle Lange will now be able to resume her
ooir-hair broom, and the daughter of Madame Ansrol
will devote her attention to the baby as of yore. Mr.
Pollard is a nice florid old gentleman, with a winning
■mile that makes children at home with him at once.
He Is very cartful about regulating the extent cf this
smile or ths children would never leave home. When
the company was here, the g rla when they cams out
from their dressing-room would, previous to going upon
the stage, file past him, and pat up their little painted
mouths for (im to kiss them. This was a beautiful
spectacle which we think the audience should not have
baen deprived of. For our own part, we thought it
better acting than that which took place before the
scenes. Mr. Pollard’s establishment in Hobart is said
to he as curious as a museum. Twenty or thirty or
three hundred—wo forget the exact number of the cbil.
dren—are all engaged from morn till dewy eve in quali-
fying themselves to delight a remote posterity. Little
Tommy will be up in the top attic sawiag away at a
violin, while Clara is down in the cellar practising a oo-
tillon. Billy, with a woolen sword and one brace of
elastic and the other of string holding up his trousers,
will be fighting a duel wish Johnny after the Utter
prodigy has finished carrying in his wood, and Julia
will be carolling a chanson in the kitchen while she
peels the potatoes for the midday meal. This is a
combination of the useful with the ornamental, whioh
cannot fail to strike the person who beholde it with
respectful awe. We are not sure, by the way, that we
have got the youngsters’ names right, but we hardly
think even their patriarchal parents could remember
them right off. For all this, we would like to sea the
Pollard family here again. They will do big business.

The Mastodon Minstrels have been doing pretty
well ia Newcastle. An absurd mistake was made in
connection with one of the company. Billy Wilson had
fallen asleep in ehnreh one night,when the gas went sud-
denly out. In groping for the door, several people walked
into Billy’s mouth before the error was discovered.
A handsome premium was offered him the next
day if he would allow his mouth to be used as the
model of a shaft. It is understood that the firm scorn
with which Billy refused this offer was snob M had never
been seen in Newcastle before.

Gaiety since Saturday night last. Now that he is about
to leave this country to go to America, it is only the
fair thing to say, in wishing him Ion voyage, that he is
one of the best gentleman comedians we have ever had
in this country. And a man must have the polish of a
gentleman in order to succeed in light comedy. A
butcher might make a very respectable low comedian
He could slash about him well enough with a cleaver,
and no doubt make a mark where broad buffoouaiy was
all that was required; but in the utterance of sharp
dry witticisms, and the rapier-play of reputes, he
would bo helplessly out of his element. This is exactly
where Mr. Titheradge ia at home,
• • •
“ False Skame” is one of the cleverest samples
of the modern school of dramatic comedy. It is es-
pecially rich in striking " situations." Its wit is keen
enough to be Gallic. And it rises in interest swiftly
and surely as the tide in a broad-mouthed bay from
beginning to end. Pinrily, it bristles with points.
/rise of “points."
• • •
In such a piece, Mr. Titheradge could not help
making an instantaneous success. His performance
was perfect. Each salienoy—we console ourselves by
coining words, when coin of other kind is scarce—was
brought ont into brilliant relief. Mr. Titheradge has a
fine tense of proportion, and an artistic knack of
“ arranging the lights ’’ so that the picture presented
shall be seen at the best angle. This proposal of mar-
riage to Magdelaine Atherly (Miss E. Bronton) in the
billiard room is deliciously cool, and the manner in
whioh he freezes up the unpleasantly male characters
in the play is the etherialised essence of elegant sar-
casm.
• • *
Mr, Frank Gates, who was, we are pained to ob-
serve, disrespectfully alluded to by the gallery as "that
cove in knickerbockers," looked particularly pretty. This
seems a little thing, but we know a number of people
who find it a H*ronlean task. It is needless to say we
never allude to ladies when we make remarks of this
kind.
• • •
As Colonel Howard, Mr. Joyce might have
counterfeited Sir Patrick Jennings,at a C ithoiio bazaar,
only that he lacked the odour of sanctity which that
pious knight Is supposed to possess. Mr. Ireland made
a paradoxically decent villain, and Mr. Bainford, ap-
parelled in gorgeous gray, with a half-crown "straw ’
his bead, from which bis piquant face peered out as
a peri’s from under a roso-bnsh, was a sight too gled for
earth. The other male performers were well enough
except, perhaps, Mr. Buckley, who seemed t<* hive been
sleeping in a hay-rick previous to his appearance upon
the stage.
• • •
We would like Miss Bronton pretty platoni-
eally well only for her inveterately bad delivery. Even
in her most joyous sentences this wilful young lady will
persist in introducing a mournful downward inflection
and a dreary emphasis on the possessive pronoun.
Otherwise she is a really nice little actress. So is Miss
B)sa Towers, only mote so. We are compelled to stop
here, foe we feel our enthusiasm getting the better of
us.

So St. Thomas a Kemmis hal been to the opera.
We don't wonder. We can’t keep away ourselves, now

A number of new things are running the Mel-
bourne theatres just " Jean Yarco’s Oath," a
drama by Q B dims, is being played at the Bijou. The
Australasian critic writes almost sarcastisally about
it. As thus f “ Perhaps Mr. Sims wrote it whea ho was
very young; or, may be, he was not well when he wrote
it; or haply he was tired with, the effort of writing
something else.” At the Opera House, “ The King’s
Dragoons ;’* at the Hoyal, “ Lights o’ London ;’* at the
Princess’s, “ The American." Promenade concerts are

Vernon Keid Is ons of the singers. Batohelder’s
Minstrels are playing at the Victoria Hall. The Christ-
mas loud Musical Festival, to be held in the Exhibition
Building, will, as far as local prophets can be believed,
be a grand success. Mr. Armea Beaumont is, we
understand, one of the singers engaged. A calico ball
is to be hold next month in aid of the Musical aud
Dramatic Association. The sufferer from cerebral
paralysis who writes the theatrical critiques for a
knock-kneed namesake of ours over there manes, iu one
oi his *■ articles," the sage remark : “ Many talented
litterateurs now rather throw their golden print at the
feat of laughing Teralia (sic) and weeping Mielpomene
(sic) than earn a living by journalism.” O divine
Muses, what have ye done to have your names mangled
by this bladder-headed butcher-boy ? Throw your
"golden print" in the gutter, Johnny! Mr. George
Darrell, wa hear, is engaged to “ star ” at Ballarat.
Solely this is a misprint for Taokaudandah ?

D’Orsay Odgen is playing up North with Mias
Ferguson, niece of the Governor of Bombay and related
to the saint* through a bishop. D’Orsay i* always
distingnj and never mixes with any but the doited
cream of aristocracy. It is, therefore, all the more
mournful for ns to have to record that he and the
haughty lady are, if not howling failures, hardly so
suooesful as Mrs. Langtry.

Mrs. Langtry has done Rosalind, and they de-
lighted the bald-heads. They voted them the most

We have called in our neighbours and rejoiced.
The saveloy man ir speechless, and the dustman dead
drunk. We have found that which was lost. The
gorgeous galaxy of burnt-cork genius which Beau
Bayliss brought ont here at such enormou* expense
from America, and which, after a very rough reception in
this unappreciative city, dived under the earth some-
where and was given np tor dead, has re-appeared in
Brisbane under a new name—“The American Trouba-
dours.” A rosejby any other name would smell as sweet.
So would aa onion The Brisbane critics are very hard
upon them We may have flogged them with whips, but
the Observer man scourges them with icorpions.
Listen to this merciless irony“ The Brisbane publio
evidently have not heard of the capital comic singer,
Mr. Thomas flayers, or they would roll up in hundreds
to enjoy the spirited rendering of the comic »ones which
this gentleman sings to perfection. Thoso wno knew
George Leybourre, Harry Rickards, or Maodermott,
aad would like to have old memories revived, should
certainly avail themselves of the opportunity, of listen-
ing to Sayers—a man who knows how to sing a comic
song well.” Now, to go and deliberately select the vary
weakest part of the show for snch sarcastic eulogium
was too malicious altogether. But, of course, this was
only in Brisbane, and the pressmen there are, as Call!,
maohus once said of the Cretans, “ all liars."
Mr. Sheridan opens at the Gaiety on Saturday
night in the "Merchant of Venice." The lovely Daven-
port comes with him. New scenery has been prepared
and everything made nice. Mr. Sheridan’s conception
of the character of ShylocV, we are happy to learn, is
somewhat different to the usual one. His Shylock is
not an ordinary old.hat harpy, but a Jew with some of
the old fire of the smiters of hip and thigh in him. Mr.
Sheridan has our good wishes, if they are won h auy-
thing, for his success. We have had a surfeit of sensa-
tion, and almost enough of opera. We want something
new. Certainly we got th's—got it in an astonishing
original fashion too. On Monday night we went to see
the Flamingoes at the Vic—wo rt ally beg pardon, at the
Academy of Music. But though undeniably, not to say
crushingly, .novel, it was not exactly what we yearned
for in other respec’s. The novelty about Mr. Sheridan
is that he is a good actor. And we still retain our
ridiculous o d preference for good acting before bad. Mr,
Sydney Hall, celebrated f- r his suavity, and world,
famous for his wondrous smile, is Mr. bheri Ian’s busi-
ness agent.

Holloway’s troupe last heard of at Coomi
Ben Allah gave a performance at Auckland a little
while ago, and had bad luck. The audience were dis-
satisfied with the distribution of gifts, and hunted him
off the stage and through the streets right up to his
hotel door And, speaking of New Zealand, the
Simonsen Company are doing fairly well there; as also
Woodyear and Boss’s Circus, Kellar and Canard, and
Stanley’s Juveniles Magae Ford had an immense
house at her benefit at Christchurch a short time ago.
Duncan Macullutn’a Opera Company are drawing
large houses at Auckland. The general impression
over there is that the company is a poor one, bnt that
the show is worth seeing on account of the gorgeous
mounting of the scenes.

“ The Red Stocking ” Minstrels appeared on
Monday at the Victorieral or Academy of Music—or
something. Anyhow, the place is near the thop in
Castlereagh-street—where we are allowed to st ck up
our tobacco. “The Red Stocking Minstre’s” aie
young ladies in stout muslin dresses and crimson Lisle
threads. They show a good deal of ankle, but not
enough for an enquiring mind. We are not, however,
enquiring minds.

“Young Dnfcchy” bosses the show, and he
shines in the capacity of a manager. Liking " Dutch,”
we are glad to see him a success in a managerial capa-
city. Miss Jennie Horan is a minstrel, and she sings
ballads: “Pretty Blue Byes" was one she warbled,
and we liked it very certainly. So we did Miss Theresa
Horan’s “ Forgive and forget, little darling." Miss T.’e
rad stockings wore very symmetrical. We trust that
Miss H. was not base enough on the date we saw her to
deceive a confiding publio I But, of course not. The—
we quote the programme— “ celebrated Horan sisters ”
afterwords sang a duet —“The Lily and the Bose.”
This was more certainly still. And so was Miss Lillie
Leuden, who sang to the harp; and so vgas not Mr. Gov.
Add. Byman, the tambo, who was funereal iu the deli-
very of hia Joe Millers. There were o.her ladies who
were anatomically disappointing, and other gentlemen
—notably Mr. Dixon—who were vocally successful.
And there was Miss Grace Henriques in a fair wig and
a very nice set of teeth, which we sincerely trust are ns
original as Miss Tessie’s ; however, we feel this to be
outside the boundary of dramatic criticism.

It ia with real pleasure we record the success of

because Miss Melville is a clever and courageous little
lady, and has taken the responsibility of this venture
upon her own little white shoulders. We are also
pleased because the performance is—taken altogether—
a first class one. As fat as Miss Melville's part in it is
concerned we may get a perfectly truthfnl tune out Of

Mr. Casselli is, if po3sible, increasing in drollery
every night. The only thing we object to in his per-
formances is the “ole plantation" style in which he
speaks. By the way, is the stage nigger, like the stage
Irishman, a humorous but hollow myth ? We don’t
object to Mr. Casselli's talking in this way because it
isn't funny. It is decidedly funny, but we respectfully
submit it is not the sort of language spoken in Spain.
But, perhaps, after all, this is but a trifling considera-
tion.

It is a great and glorious thing to be able to
state that, with the exception of Miss Melville
herself, Beaumont, Farley, and Tom Cassell,
all the artistes of the Opera House Company
are Australians. We are especially delighted to
think that the Misses Marie and Madeline St. Clair
are natives of this country. We are perfectly serious in
saying thi*, because both of these young ladies are
accomplished enough and prettv enough to represent
the talent and beauty of Australia anywhere. «e taka

“ Locomotive apparatus ” ia the enphonistic
phrase whioh American critics use to deseiibe those

Signor G. Verdi.
We give in this issue a portrait of Signor G.
Verdi, the celebrated baritone. Signor Verdi is a
native of Baltimore, U.8., and was born in 1854.
The legal profession was selected for him, and he
began his studies under the brothers Kean, the
best lawyers in the State. The profession, how-
ever, was distasteful, and having early proof of
the possession of a very fine baritone voice, he
resolved to adopt the operatic stage. He married
the daughter of Dr. Howard Thorpe, one of the
leading medical men of Delaware, and shortly
afterwards proceeded to Italy to study; be-
came e pupil at Milan of the eminent Lamperti,
and succeeded in his studies. He made
his dihut at the Opera House, Lugarno, Switzer-
land, as Belisario in the opera of that name,
achieved a decided triumph, wound up his
Italian career at the Bellini Theatre, Palermo,
Sicily, and then accepted an engagement to sing
in opera in Russia, Poland, and Austria. The
opera critics of each of the big cities ho visited
predicted for him a brilliant professional career.
His next engagement was with Strakoeoh, the
great American impressario, as primo baritone
in a company of which the famous Marie Roze,
Louise Kellogg, and others, were also principals.’
He was about the first American born artist that
sang in Italian opera in the States. His success
in hia native land was very great. A London tour
with the same impressario was his next engage-
ment, and it was while in London that he met Mr.
W. S. Lyster, through whose instrumentality he
was secured for the Australian operatic stage.
His first appearance in the colonies was at the
Opera House, Melbourne, on the 22nd March.
He has occupied a first position in the ranks of
his profession in Australasia, and his triumphs
are incidents of importance in the operatic history
of the country. Signor Verdi claims that no
singer of hia age has studied and sung in so many
principal roles of Italian opera as himself. Signor
Verdi is now under engagement to Williamson,
Garner, and Musgrove, and remains the principal
baritone of the “Masootte” troupe, till his ap-
pearance in Italian opera at Melbourne imme-
diately after Christmas.
Mr. A. Brace Smith.
On our first page to-day wa give a portrait of
Mr. Arthur Bruce Smith, the eminent young bar-
rister who has been selected by the Opposition kb
their candidate for Gundagai. Mr Smith, who is
one of the seven sons of Captain Howard Smith,
the most enterprising and prosperous of Aus-
tralian shipowners, was born in Victoria, obtained
his legal education in England, ana has rapidly
acquired a large practice at the N.8.W. bar—a
fact attributable in an even greater degree to hia
marked ability as a lawyer than to the great com-
mercial influence wielded by hia family in these
colonies. Mr. Smith made his mark in Victoria
both as a platform speaker and as a political
writer, was nominated by the Constitutional party
to contest a Western seat, fought a vigorous
battle, was defeated by a very narrow majority,
and was highly eulogised for hia political efforts
by the Constitutional press. He adds the strong
common-sense of the experienced commercial man
to the acumen of the practised advocate; ia
socially a favourite, and inherits the vigor, honesty
and determination which have made a fortune for
his father. We hope to see him in the Assembly.
Mr. G. R. Dibbs stands for St. Leonards.
Mr. John Meeks ia to be nominated for West
Sydney.
Dr. Hughes’ Sunday night lectures at the
Theatre Royal are an intellectual treat.
Miss Lydia Hastings’ elocutionary entertain-
ment at Burwood, on the 15th, was a fine intelleetual
treat. The programme, which was interspersed with
songs by well-known amateurs and professionals, was a
severe test for Miss Hastings, but she went through it
with every success. The recital of "The Fall of Pem.
barton Mills'* was a brilliant effort. It ia to be heped
that Miss Hastings’ services will be secured in con-
nection with the projected elocutionary classes of the
Publio Schools.

The Aemidalb Chronicle furnishes its
readers with the exhilarating intelligence that “MGuan,
lying under sentence of death in the Armidale gaol
seems now quite resigned to his fate.” Also that
"preparations have been commerced for the erection
of the gallows." This is what we should call nice light
breakfast reading. And we have no donbt that Mr.
M'Quan enjoyed the spectacle of the soaffold-building,
as he trifled with his tea and toast in the morning and
had a cheery joke for the carpenters as they went par t
his window to their dinner at noon. And the carpen-
ters, with an honest pride in their work, and a respect
for the cheerfulness of the man for whom it was intended,
took pains to make a good job of it, and perhaps even
ornament it hero and there, and give it a gayer appear-
ance than is usual with most gallows. And when the
job was completed the boss carpenter doubtless walked
backward like other artists until he got it at the right
focus, and then going up to M’Guan’s window re-
marked, in a tone of mingled pleasure and oongratnla-
tion, “Ah! there’s something like a gallows for you."
There is an airy mirthfulness about this M'Guanesque
philosophy which would please ns exceedingly only
that we are afraid Mr. M ‘G a an was a sinner, and is
having a bit of bad luck just about now.

From somewhere on the Clyde we have received
this pleasing little religious par. : —We were oelebrat-
ing our Church anniversary by a tea-meeting, at which
our worthy pastor was to preside. He arrived late,
but all went well until the minister (ho was dressed in
white drill from top to toe) got up to return thanks for
the tea, etc., and some gay youth put a large jelly-Ash,
of which the local river is full, on to his chair. You
can, perhaps, faintly imagine what occurred when he
sat down. As soon as he could speak, he (after scratch-
ing away , with as much dignity as he could muster, a
lot of the jelly) said: “If I only knew the (blanked)
blackguard—I beg your pardon, ladies—I mean the
infernal larrikin who did this (hero he scratched off
another chunk of jelly), I’d-I’d-er—give him in
charge,” Then he walked backwards out of the hall,
and wasn’t seen for the balance of the evening. He has
put up a reward of £2 for information as to the ham-
and-jelly man. At the same meeting there was a fight
between two chnrch-wardens (who weren’t ‘cousins*
owing to a bull-impounding trouble), the end of which
was that one church officer was taken homo minus his
coat and with the rim of his hat down on his shoulders."

Fit out the race of humankind
With what it has ef mouth or mind.
At times the sense won’t go all round,
So some men only get the sound.
But eveu this is weighed, and each
Man gets a certain share of speech—
So much of truth, so much of lies,
And when he’s worked it out he dies.
You may think, Dan, at the first view.
This tale does not apply to yon.
For if it did you would, yon know.
Have died a score of years ago ;
But you have turned the tables, faith,
By talking other men to death.
Take heed if on like this you go
Another hundred years or no.

And so they took the place by storm.
Boad metal flies and windows smash;
Three female shoulders jamb
The front door in with awful crash—
A human battering ram !
When Slater steps forth to reprove, a
Swift thumping thwack greets his “ Kadoova.”
Then Slater “pulled” his ma-in-law,
And also sister Julia;
And cheery was his glad guffaw
He swears no more to baulk her pleasure.
She vows at home to take her leisure.

that the average girl ef to-day is nothing but a " pea to
bang fine clothes on, a mincer of fine words and polite
phrases, a parader of useless and supeifioial accom-
plishments, for ever aping to be ‘ proper’ according to
society standard, deadening all her natural feelings, and
angling in the matrimonial market with the cold,
blooded calculation of a stock-jobber." Perhaps George
would like to see his “peg" without any clothes on at
all P Or when she is not “ aping to be proper P" Or
perhaps he is a blighted bachelor, and hss been left in
the matrimonial fishpond—by the way, bow could one
“ angle” in a " market P”—because of a fatter and more |
valuable gudgeon P

A Northern editor prints a paragraph describing
a scorpion which he saw " last night." Nothing is said

In giving a list of the magistrates who had signed
licensing permits recently, in South Australia, the

“Strange, isn’t it?” said an aquatic cynic the
other day; " but it you'really want to see an honest

generally, the State has had to brand with infamy and

A Riverina magistrate wanted, the other day, to

would got a prize or not, it must ba a chance, and there-

been pointed out, a man entering a public-houao with

the landlord will short for him in return; hot would a
prosecution for a lottery lie against the Landlord?
Pure chance is not l ittery, for the latter must depend

Then Susan hit a plan to quell the riot:
She first went round to whore the barman slept—
Called him—and told the slavey to be quiet.
Who now hysterically yelled and wept;
Then calculating the right time to try it,

And, having made a diligent collection
From the bar till, she went into her room.
There was no light exoopt the dim reflection

Of rum that loaded all the atmosphere there.

There are very few townships in the inAeafor of
this colony where there Is a more actum ipablica
spirit, and it is very doubtful if any c«Her taunt-
oipaltty in the country can show a mayoral his-
tory more distinguished for liberality and intel-
ligent .progress than Singleton. Mr. Uuinn haa
proved himself a worthy successor of Mr. Monro
and others who have done so much to improve and
beautify this pleasant little township on the'Hunter.
Mr. Quinn come to this colony with his people in
1846. when only two veers of age. Ha was born
in limerick, Ireland. His people settled in Mait-
land, whore Mr. Quinn remained till he reached
manhood, when he proceeded t« Queensland, start-
ing a successful business in Ipswieh. Ho returned
to N.S. W., and settled at Singleton, where ho haa
been verv successful in commercial pursuits. He
has been an alderman of the borough for twelve
years, and Mayor for two years in succession. On
the representations of a largely-signed petition of
the townspeople, Mr. Quinn’s name was olaoed on
the list of new magistrates recently. [Our por-
trait la from an excellent photo, by Moss, of Mait-
land.]

Amateur crews are now being formed to com-
pete for the Gardiner Challenge Cnp on 16th December.
The Warwick and Petersham 2nd elevens quar-
relled on Saturday, and the Petersham captain drew the
Stamps. The Warwicks appear to hare bean in fault.
The Sydney Qnn Club had a pleasant outing on
Saturday at Botany. There was an exciting contest for
the President’s Cup, Mr. O. Friend being the winner.
The Surrey Uniteds were defeated on Saturday
by the Orientals by 29 rnns, the scores being : Orientals
63—Ironside 19, Donnan 12. Surrey United 34— Arkin-
a tall 10.
Everybody was astonished and pleased to see
Midwinter with the Australian team on Saturday. It
is reported that he does not intend to return to England,
bat will quietly settle down in Ballarat.
The English cricketers were granted free passes
over the Victorian lines. Of course N S. Wales will
ollow the example and give the “ foreigners” a trip
over the mountains.
The Hon. —we beg pardon—Sir W. J. Clarke,
Baronet, is active already with regard to yachting
matters. He wants to see the Janet tackle some of the
.Sydney cracks in an International yacht race.
Evening News y. Lee and Ross, for the
triuters* Challenge Cup, resulted in a win for the
latter by eight wickets, the scores being : Evening
News SS and 18. Lee and Boss 49—M’Donald 22, North,
J.6. Second innings six for two wickets.
Jem Mace has offered to stand up against the
American pugilist Sullivan, and will wager that the
latter will not knock him out. of time in six rounds.
Mace is also prepared to back Slade, the Tlmaru, New
Zealand, halt-oaste, to fight Sullivan for from §1000 to
$5000.
The Murrumbidgee Turf Club has arranged for
a fourth day’s racing on Saturday. The programme
comprises a Trotting Match for £100, a Consolation
Handicap of 50 sovs., a Final Fly of 20 sovs., and a
Sailing Plata of 20 sovs. The race ball is to oome off on
Monday.
Following are the entries for the Krug Cham-

Sydney Bowing Club; F. S. Ives, J. Trimble, W. G.
Brett, Mercantile Bowing Club; D. Middleton, North
Shore Bowing Club; A. F. Sharland, Hobart, Derwent
Bowing Club, and F. Clarke
Preparations are to be at once commenced for
the Intercolonial eight-oar race, which is to be rowed
this year on the Parramatta Eiver. The last race was
won by careful and assiduous practice, and it is to be
heped that the lesson it afforded will not be neglected.
We would, however, suggest a new boat for our crew.
The Belvidere and University Clubs played in
«ka Domain on Saturday, the game resulting in a draw.
University scored 112, to which Powell contributed 45.
Wright 20, and Allen 13. Belvidere made 69 for six
wickets — Barnett 27, and W. Eichardson 17 being
the highest scorers.
A certain suburban cricket club have a “ dnok
fund ” To this, every batsman with a round 0 to his
credit cheerfully contributes 3d. When the fund
reaches a good big sum, say eighteen pence, the crack
batsmen make off to the nearest pub , and never see
daylight till the whole of the capital so laboriously
accumulated by their juniors is sqnandered in debauch.
M. P. Lucas has been cabled for to augment the
English teem in their match against the Australian
Eleven. Mr. Lucas will have to act quickly, and start
i.t once to reach Melbourne by the end of December.
Then he will require at Last a week’s practice to brim;
fei«i up to form. By that time the English team will
toi in tar better condition than the Australians, who
will have been inactive.
The Balmain Rowing Club was formally opened
on Saturday. The club numbers 100 members, and now
p assesses five skiffs aad one gig. The only racing event
in connection with the opening was a single-scull race
f >r atrophy presented by the captain, Mr. A. Fraser.
Bight competed, audit was rowed in two heats and a
flcal heat. It was won by about six lengths by J.
■j Langley.
Lein the French amateur champion sculler,
whose desperate race with Lowndes for the Diamonds
was one of the features of the last Henley meeting, has
again met with bad luck. In the race for the champion-
ship of the Marne, he met with an opponent as desper-
, ately determined ss his Henley antagonist; for, after
being twenty lengths to the bad. he drew up, and just
beat Lein by a foot on the post. Ho the rowing of
plucky stern-wagers has now ceased to he the preroga-
tive of Englishmen.
The match between Parliament and Press on
Monday on the Association Ground, resulted in a
victory for Parliament by 25 runs. The cricket dis-
played was much above the standard of muff matches,
and a very pleasant day was spent, thcugh the game
had to be stopped about 5 on account of the rain. The
scores were : Parliament 117—W. R. Campbell 31, J-
M. Purves28, H. Levion 16. Press 92—C. Bateman 25,
J. George 17, J. W. Roberts 19.
Largan’s challenge was not allowed to re-
main long unanswered. The following matches ha\e
been made, and the first portions of the stakes de-
poeited at Mr. P. Punch’s hotelLargan v. Pearce,
£50 aside, to come off on December 3J ; Largan v. E.
Triokett, £100 aside, January 6; Largan v. M‘Donald,
£100 aside, January 13. All to be rowed over the
champion course in best and bast boats. We hare a
plethora of sculling matches before up, and we presume
the usual contradictory results will puzzle us until the
next series.
The match for the Furness Cup, between the
Osborne and Carlisle Cricket Clubs, was concluded on
Saturday, and resulted in a victory by ten wickets for
the former, the scores being: Carlisle, first innings, 58
—Donnelly 19, Ferris 13 M.‘Dowell(notout) 12; second
innings, 27—Whiteman 19. Osborne, first innings, 80—
Williams 35, Clayton 14, R. Toby 11, Anderson 10; second
innings, 7 for no wickets. Two matches for the Cup are
to be commenced on Saturday—Corio v. Carthona on the
Cop wickets, and Raymond v. Surry United on the
latter’s ground.
Another candidate for champion sprint-running
has turned up at Walgett in the person of an aboriginal
who rejoices in the cacophonous cognomen of Combar-
delo Billy. He has just defeated the well-known
runner, Ryoe, by four yards, covering 150 yards in a
fraction under 15 see. Ryoe'* backers laid £150 to £120.
We didn’t see the race, bnt we have been told all this
by a reliable party, and Billy’s friends say they are pre-
pared to back him against anyone in the colonies for
the same distance. It is to bo hoped that if Billy takes
to professional running he will show his paler compeers
how to ran honestly, though it must be admitte-l that,
whatever party he be connected with, there will always
be a pair of black-legs in it.
Groube, who was selected to practise for the
Victorian team, being dissatisfied with the form he
exhibited, retired and suggested that Rosser should
take his place. Such an instance of modesty in a
cricketer is worth recording. Now, over here, the
difficulty is to keep candidates out of the practice. No
one wants to retire, bnt there are hundreds who want
to get in. The path of the selection committee is not
strewn with roses. By the way, talking of the selection
committee, Mr. Faithfnll has not yet turned up at the
practices, thongh Messrs. Fletcher and Nunn dally air
their flannels. And, judging from the form shown at
practice, we shall not be astonished to find, when the
final selection is made, that some of the long-familiar
names will bo cut of the team—that is, if the selection
committee do their duty.
A special general meeting of the Carlton Cricket
Club was held on the 15th. Mr. J. P. Gitvan, M P ,
was eleoted president, in the room of the late Hon. 8.
C. Brown. Mr. Bingemann was appointed treasurer in
the place of Mr. Wearne resigned. The selection com-
mittee now consists of five membersMessrs. F.
M'Goveney, F. Waters, T. Nunn, A. Geary, and J.
Portus. Before the meeting terminated, Mr, Portus
was presented with a handsome tea and coffee service
in recognition of his services to the club. Mr. Portus,
taken by surprise, was eloquently brief, and stated that
whenever the interests of the club required his atten-
tion “Jack’s the lad.” As a successor to our only
Charley, who, we are glad to say, looks splendid after
his tour on the “ Continong,” he had an up-hill task to
perform, bnt he has fulfilled his arduous duties with
every satisfaction.
The Carlfcon-Warwick match for the Holda-
worth Cup was concluded on Saturday, the Carltons
winning in one innings by 78 runs. The Warwicks had
to obtain 189 to save a one innings’ defeat, and that
they did not accomplish this was more through their
very bad batting than the superior bowling and fielding
of the Carltons. The score reaohed was 111, to whieh
Bearle contributed 30 by vigorous play, Hiddlestene 24,
in his usual cffietive style, Sweetman 13, and Dr.
Watson 12. The Warwick team was decidedly the
weakest the oiub has played daring this the first series
of matches for the Cup. When the second series is
oommenoed, the Warwiek team will be reinforced by
Davis, Artnnr Gregory and A, Newoombe. Downes
will probably have recovered his health, and the W ar-
wioks may be expected to make a much better fight
than hitherto.
The Antwerp carrier pigeons imported a few
months ago by Mr. Samuel Hordern, of Darling Point,
have been thoroughly acclimatised, and some good
stock has already been secured. The birds cost £20
per pair; one or two are the actual winners of the 500-
mile National race, and the others are bred from other
winners of equal merit. Altogether, the stock is the
best flown in Gern any. The distances done by these
birds vary from 300 miles to 528 miles—one of them, a
grand dark blue chequer cook,, having won every race
from 100 milee upwards. One of the younger birds is
out of a famous red hen that flew from Plymouth to
Brussells in less than nine hours, doing nearly 1400
yards per minute, the distance in a straight line being
370 miles. Another of the young birds is a blue chequer
hen, whose father won the great German National 500-
mile race three times in succession. The whole im.
portation of these carrier pigeons, with freight, &c,
cost Mr, Hordern £250, and he deserves success in his
spirited effort te introduce a superior breed of carriers
to this country. Pigeon-fanoieis may see the birds on
application.
The Australian Eleven did not get the reception
which was their due, simply because those who made
the arrangements bungled their business. However,
those who did meet the cricketers gave them cordial
welcome. There was plenty of hand shaking, toasting,
and congratulating. Every member of the team has
Improved in appearance. Qiffen is slightly lame, not
having recovered from the accident he met with.
Palmer, it is feared, will never be able to play again, he
having received a severe strain in the Players’ match.
He has sustained a serious injury in the groin, which
will affect him probably for years. Garrett has put on
3 st. weight: the trip has certainly improved him. All
the cricketers, with the exception of Murdoch, Massie,
Spofforth, and Jones, visited the Association Ground,
and each, on entering the pavilion, was accorded a
hearty round of applawse. After the Warwick-Carlton
match was concluded, some practice was indulged in by
the team. Palmer tried some bowling, and succeeded
in taking M’Donnell’s single stump twice. Qiffen
astonished everybody by his immense bitting power.
The Hon. Ivo Bligh’s team have given abundant
proofs of their stamina by the manner in which they
have wiped out the Melbourne team. The English
Eleven in their first innings scored 273. The Victorian
team scored, first innings, 104—Turner 25, Rosser 22,
Kelly 20, M’Sbane 14. Second innings, 169—Bruce 40,
Scott 26, Swift 18. Turner 17, M’Shane 15, Kelly 14,
Rosser 11. Tnis brought the scores exactly level, and
Barlow and G. B Studd were sent in to make the one
run to win; four byes were scored, and the stumps
were drawn. The match was well attended, but the
Victorians were thoroughly outmatched, and there was
little or no interest taken in the event. To prevent a
recurrence of this undesirable consummation, onr
cricket patrons ought to use their influence with the
N.S.W. contingent of the Australian Eleven to play for
the colony. They have done enongh for the “honour of
Australia;” the “honour" of Victoria lies trampled—it
is not too late to preserve that of New South Wales.

North Shore speaks and yet another champion
eouller is forthcoming. “ Mr. James Phelps will row
any man in the world in waterman’s boms any distance
over three miles for the sum of from £5') to £5)1.
(Hanlan preferred ) Man and money at the Best Hotel,
North Shore." Mr Phelps is about 163 years of age,
and won the Lavender Bay Championship about 500
years ago. Having continued to steadily improve, he
now throws down the gauntlet to all the world. For
the sake of the honour of hia adopted country, he pre-
fers to dress down Hanlan first. We do not think he
will get a match on for several reasons. Life is too
short to explain them. However, James is plucky, and
if any scalier wants to take up the challenge, he will
find that Mr. Phelps will be in earnest—probably until
the dollars are to be started. If James is ‘ bine
mouldy" for a race, we have a blacking bottle cork
which we floated down the gutters in the halcyon days
of oar youth. It can still float.
Bendigo (V.) Races, Nov. 15 and 16. First day.
Wizard was made the favourite forthe Epsom Handicap,
which was won by Cassiopeia by half a neok. In the

and speedily shook off Squireen, winning by a length
and a half. Squireen and Losbia ran a great race for
second place, the former finishing a neok in front. Trot
won the Extra Handicap, and Cassiopeia scored a second
victory in the Telegraph Stakes,—Second day. Squireen
won the Flying Handicap, easily. The Handicap Trot
was a victory for Leithamstead by five lengths, cracks-
man led most of the distance for the Handicap Hurdles,
and won by five lengths. Quixote was made a big
favourite for the Bendigo Handicap, bat Lesbia won by
a length, after a great race. The Hawk was the favour-
ite for the Handicap Steeplechase, and being the only
horse who did not fail or baulk, he won easily.

Mace out of time, he was to receive an extra £50. The
men appeared pretty evenly matched, and taken alto-
gether it is said Mace had very lictio the best of the

but these did little damage. From tbs outset Mace
went in for body blows, and some that got home took
heaps of fight—and wind—ont of Belcher, who could
ill afford to lose much of the latter. Belcher paid his
compliments entirely to his opponent's countenance,
and not once during the progress of the fight did he
deliver a body blow. Had he only got one or two home
fair on the mark in that direction, he would, without a
shadow of a doubt, have been able to prolong the con-
test. When compelled to give up, he was completely
exhausted. Considering the gross condition of the men,
the four rounds were fought with surprising rapidity,
very little time being wast id in useless sparring."

In tho match at Leeds between the Australians
and Shaw’s Eleven, Percy M’Donnell came ont of his
shell in a most remarkable manner. His bibs for four
were like "opening oysters.’’ In the first innings he
scored 45 out of the 46 runs that were made while he
was at the wlokets. Out of this there were only three
singles, two sixes, seven fours, and a two. In the second
innings he eoored 35, made up by a six, five fours, two
twos, and five singles. While he was in, 63 runs were
scored la 55 minutes In the match at Scarborough
between the Australian Eleven and I Ztngari, Bonnor
went in whan the eoore was at 256 tor four wicaecs. In

From one over of Mr. A. P. Lnoas, be scored 20 rune,
hitting the first and third bulls out of the ground for

of the 167 runs made while he was in, he scored 122.
Bannerman was his companion, and his score at the
oloee of the day was 120 (not oat), having been in the
whole day and part ef the preceding one. Bonnor gave
two very hot catohee in the early part ®f his innings...
"Tog" Wilson’s backers have been informed that be

quently the £100 pat ap goes to Elliott’s backer. This
is indeed a very sad state of affairs A London writer
says that Spofforth quite broke down every now and
then. The "Demon" seemed t* be pretty well the
most important man in the team. He almost won the
All-England match single-handed; and, again, the want
of his first-class bowling caused the lose of the North
of England match... According to the American papers,
the largest stud in the world is that of Governor Stan-
ford, in California. He owns five hundred thoroughbred

...A paper called Chicket, specially devoted tothenoblo

colonies, with all his notable performances with the

regatta at Saratoga; seven went to the post, viz., Boss,
Courtney, Lee, Riley, Sheldon, Hosmer, and Ten Eyok.

in America, entered, bat did not start. Boss, of course,
was favourite, and next in demand to him was Court-

although he seems to have looked dangerous for half
the distance, he must have collapsed in the same way
that he did when Layoook tackled him in the Hop

Courtney rowed a desperate race home, and Lee jnst
won. The time for the three miles was SOmin. 43seo,
The race was on dead lake water, without any tide or
current whatever. If this is Boss’s real form, he will
hardly be anxious to force on the meeting with Hanlan
which he (Boss) asserts the Toronto man is afraid to

at the early age of 34, of Mr. Bernard Paunoafota. He
will be remembered chiefly in connection with cricket
at Bngby and Oxford. Captain of the School Eleven In
1867, be went up to the University In 1868, and was in
the Dark Blue team far four years, acting as captain in
1809 and 1870. He went abroad after tne season of 1871,
when his cricket career terminated Jem Ward, for-
merly pugilistic champion of the wend, is now 82 years
old, and Bailers from paralysis The Australian
Eleven bad a deal of bad luck in England. An injured
hand kept Boyle out of seven successive engagements;
illness aud accident compelled them several times to
play without Blaokham; a rioked sinew compelled
Spofforth to stand out of the team tor ten dare in
August; and for the last six weeks Oiffea suffered
from a had knee. Worst of all. Palmer was
hurt In the Players’ match at the Oval, and
was nnable to take any further part in the tour
In the 38 matches at home the Australians won the toss
on 21 occasions. Onoe they put their opponents in, and
once they ware sent in themselves, la all they lost
553 wicket-, and scored a gross total of 10,795 rang;
while the 38 teams that opposed them lost 653 wickets,
and soared 9.089 runs. As regards the lour lead ng
batsmen of the team, it is worthy of notice that Mar-
doata has been bawled out 24 times, Massie 21 times,
Bannerman 15 times, and Horan only 13 times. Mur-
doch has been dismissed seven times withoat scoring,
Mamie nine times, Bannerman fanr times, and Uoraa
only three times. Blaokham, at the wicket, has got
rid of 45 batsmen, catching 28 and stumping 17. The
highest total that the Australians made was 643 against
Sussex at Brighton, and the lowest 49, against the
United Eleven, at Tunbridge Wells. The highest total
against the Australians was 322 by the Players at the
Ova), and the lowest 32, by the Scotch Eleven, et.

vidual innings of over 100; seven for the Australians,
and four against them. Murdoch made 286, not out,

Several hundreds enjoyed a quiet afternoon’s
airing last Saturday, at the opening of the Balmain
Rowing 1 Club Boat Shod. Shortly after throe, the
Qaandong, well filled, left Brskine-street, and picking
other passengers on the trip, reached White Horse
toint with a large load. Here the two bands, Gne on
board and one on shore, played different times both at
once, with a pleasing effect. There was a crowd at the
shed, including a number of young men with very little
on, who represented the muscle and manliness of other
clubs, and had come to do honour to Balmain enter-
prise—and, give the girls a treat. The mayor, Mr. W.
A. Hntohinaon, spoke a few appropriate words from an
exalted position on a kitchen chair, and than hia second
pretty daughter. Miss Mary, broke a bottle of cham-
pagne (which was foolishly allowed to run to waste)
over a new skiff which was launched, and all wa* over.
A couple of races took place, end the muscular youths
with multicoloured oaps processed round, followed by
the Quandong, all gay with the fluttering of female rai-
ment, the Spark with the Commodore’s party, and an-
other steamer, that seemed to ba naturally very dirty,
but was specially “ dona up" lor the occasion. In the
shod were the Club skiffs, and some sandwiches and
beer, which beer, as the Pbnbtqbaph observes, " was
very gratifying, and, likewise, gave satisfaction to
many.” After a tour round, all the steamers returned,
the Quandong bore off with its load of bead-eyed
beauty, the crowd melted away, and the yon. g men
oivered up their biceps and went home, explaining toons
another that Balmain is the flaeat place fer boating im
the whole universe.

There was a church bazaar in theEedfern Town
Hall all last week. It wae very exciting. The stalls
wore heavily loaded with wool mats, children s under-
clothing, and penny pictures of George Washington,
sud Eliiah going up in the fiery chariot. Occasionally,
there was vocal music, and though it was evidently the
first public appearance of moet of the performers, they
faced the ordeal without shrinking. This was mors
than the audience could do. Ths principal object of
interest was a trophy, consisting of twelve doeen of
gooseberry jam, by which a local firm judiciously ad-
vertised themselves. Ib was a vsty moral bazaar, and
so far as the blandishments of female beauty were con-
cerned, we believe even the Rev. Hodgson could havs
gone there without a blush being called upon his modest
cheeks.

The complimentary ball to Mrs. Bentley on
Friday, at Needs’ Rooms, was attended by a com-
pany of about 150. This number obviated any
crowding, and allowed all to dance with comfort, with
room to spare. But it is not to the credit of the many
hundreds of pupils and visitors who have derived plea-
sure from the lady’s perfect playing for years past at
the Academy, that the number was not far larger.
Give a free treat, and certain people will oome in hun-
dreds. but ask them to pay—even the merest trifle, and
tsiey will resort to any subterfuge, take shelter under
the meanest or paltriest exoute.to avoid doing so. When f
every year, Mr. Needs gives hia closing ball, friend*
drop in by shoals, and the ballroom Is thronged, but,
ask these “ friends" for a slight recognition in return,
and they “ don’t see why they should, ’ and so on. On
this occasion, exceedingly rich dresses were worn by
some of the ladies present, and none looked better than
the two fair daughters of the boneflciaire. Misses Mary
aad Josephine Bentley wore splendid costumes of white
satin, precisely alike, trimmed with glistening white
passementerie, lower skirts of finely kilted tarlatans and
fine lace white wreaths. A Darlington young lady was
in a cream polonaise, cut; in three large square
tab*, showing underneath a purple plum underskirt,
and edged with cream seaweed fringe and bestrewn
with large pearls, heavy strings of which were lacsd
over the front of the satin skirt; flowers were also
wirn. A little Randwiok lady wore pink silk of very
delicate tint, and exquisitely made. A beautiful Glebe
dinner wore a dress all black velvet, without sleeves,
the place of which wa* supplied by a network of small
psaris down to the elbows—ornaments of same in the
hair The skirt was beaded and two or throe cardinal
streamers brightened the effect of the black. Two sis-
ters ernt of P’matta, wore respectively amber satin
with ruff, draped with black lace, pomegranate wreath ;
the younger, white satin polonaise with ruff, so fenno
satin skirt, wreath of lilies of the valley and roseleaves.
The elder of the two Bourke-streek sisters wore a bright
satin combination of light bine and cerise; the younger
a cream oatmeal cloth decked with blue—a dancer
of perfect grace. A lively Balmain girl was
lioveldy in white satin and lace, with small leaf gar-
lands A long-trained dress, worn by the wife of a
theatrical lessee, was both unique and handsome: in it
French gray, or palest dove colour, was skilfully
blended with other shades of the same colour of satin,
and a sash of cocoa brown passed round the skirt,
relieved by just a soupflon of vivid green ; the front of
the delioate-hued skirt was quilted, the corner of each
square being held with golden ornaments. A tall
uitelv blonds was conspicuous in white poplin and laoo
to match ; and a pretty brunette. with an Italian name,
was in pure white lawn, nicely shirred and fitted, and
j ast touched off with a dash of cardinal. A young lady
from the Gaiety wore a-nelhe-gant blue brochd, long
train, and cream lace. From Queen-street came a
wishing little blonde with a terrible friz, whose
r liment was a blending of very uncommon colours,
the bodice of brownish red moire, and band of tame
r jund a pale yellow skirt, giving her quite an ait of
subdued sadness. From Moors 1 a
some cream satin, sleaveiess, cabled with bright
fliwsrs. on a fair lady of Hebrew name; while a hand-
aome face, above blue cashmere with puffed sleeves,
kilted flounces of old gold, and old gold ruohmg round
the neck, was associated with ideas of Francs. The
Citv Catering Company purveyed good refreshments,
■which were religiously attended to, and as good dancers
were not scarce, the bail was as pleasant as could be
desired. 9 9
New words and phrases are constantly being

A pleasant social party was given in Glammia
Hall last week by Messrs. Carroll, Piper, and others.
Sixty present; sixteen dances. A conspicuous dross
w is of pale blue and crimson satin, laoe-trimmed, on a
™ung married lady; and a quiet costume of pmkcotded
silk and broche was equally handsome, worn by a
Miller’s Point contralto. A petite musician from Re -
fsra in puffed pink; a Paddington blonde in blue
ailk • end a lively little fiancee of Paddington (soon to
i nn’a young lawyer) in cream and cardinal, were there.
Fr jm Glenmore-road was a married lady in Waok volvet
aud cream lace: a sister-in-law was in pale blue, cream,
and pearls. There were two belles—of opposite styles.
M irlboro-street sent a brunette whoso A*the
was shown in black satin, opening heart-shape at the
throat and filled in with masses of cream lace, holly-
hooks for contrast in the jetty hair. And from North
Shore came a graceful blonde, whose acknowledges!
be intv was graced by a pure white lawn and ivy leaves,
j, jj e Qroen played, and the fantastic character of his
efforts was even more pronounced than usual.

Last Thursday, the Town Hall vestibule was the
eiene of a return party given to Professor West by his
papils and friends. Areally good night s dan®”
ei joyed, and from eight to three o clock the items
f»(lowed one another in quick succession. The night
being very sultry, the cool corridors were mud appr«-
oi ited. As almost all the ladies and gentlemen had met
before and formed acquaintance, programmes mieu
rapidly; and even before the music started some of the
basiegei fair ones had to announce that they wore
**auite full’’—while the gentlemen who approached the
p.palar belles too late, and were crowded out m conse ;
q mace, had to content themselves with a thudextra
reluctantly scribbled in the margin. A trio of Bedfern
Bisters all capital dancers, and all in white, were amorg
the earliest to reach this advanced atateofpr<>engag©-
mant—while two sisters who are a credit to the Hawkes-
bnry district had their programmes slml J a^, fr ®®:
selected at an early hour. And the same fate befell
two light blues from the Glebe, who are like enough to
be sisters, but are not; also a little dry-blue and earn
satin from Glebe Road. A beautiful dancer was a taU
dark young lady from Woolialira— nlwaya one of tae
most admired In Professor West’s classes—m a
trained pink satin, with draperies of white lace; so was
a tall fair girl, whose sleeveless bine satin and ecru fitted
an admirable figure. The finest dress in the room was
worn by a stylish married lady: it was a bright solden
yellow broohd, without sleeves, hung with black lace
and flowers, a dash or two of cardinal was aeon at the
skirt, the lower part of which had a border of cardinal,
and above it was a row o£ squares in the yellow skirt,
the corners of which lapped down and displayed cardinal
iasile : necklet of golden pearls. A Waverley lady wore
a nice dress of white, a long pointed tabher coming
nearly to the hem in front, edged with old gold lace,
skirt kilted and belaced. The wife of the to anager of an
American enterprise wore a rich combination of light-
bine and pink satin, elaborately gathered and puffed,
and embellished with pearly passementerie: it was very
handsome. Another married lady displayed a claret
satin panier and shrimp satin skirt, prettily po fled and
flowered—perhaps a trifle ioo warm in colouring fora
summer night. Cooler-looking was the white lawn of a
Waverley lady, trimmed with rows of lace and mauve
ribbons. A light-pink trained satin, trimmed with
bouquets of roses, was very nice on a lady vocalist from
Sandwick; whence also came a handsome girl with
dark hair, in white striped satin. Of two sisters in pink,
one was married, and wore a very rich dress, while the
other was so quiet that it was only on a second glance
her face was discovered to possess more than ordinary
oh&rms. Every alternateldanoe on the carte was a waltz,
and there were several extras, making about 16 waltzes
in all; and, even then, soma of the insatiate dancers,
like Oliver Twist, “ asked for more." The foot is, that
the waltz is a speciality of the Professor's : his style fa
a free running step, which, with its variations, forward,
backward, and reverse, renders it very unfatigning;
and, on Thursday, one could scarcely have thrown a
feather without hitting a good waltzer. Mr. Somers s
playing was in excellent time—his Scotch selections
specially admired; and Compagnoni's catering gave
thorough satisfaction. Owing to Mr. West’s departure,
the party was organised very hurriedly, and it was there-
fore the more creditable to the committee (of whom
Messrs. Pemell, Higgins, and L. J. Bernard were the
chief workers) that it was so thoroughly enjoyable.

The Municipal Elections.
The Municipal Elections are approaching, and it
is for the citizens to say whether or not the pre-
sent work of reform, now going along so satisfac-
torily, is to continue. The straight lino for the
citizens to take is to vote for
The Bulletin Ticket.
Macquarie Ward.— Mr. S. Burdekin against
Mr. S. E. lees. .
Gipps Ward.—Mr. J. D. Young against all
comers. .
Fitzrot Ward —Mr. James Poole against Mr.
Paddy M l Mahon.
Denison Ward. —Mr. Evan Jones against Mr.
John Meeks. .
Phillip Ward.— Mr. D. O’Connor against Mr.
Tombstone Eoseby. , .

Cook Ward.— Mr. John Davies against Mr.
Parker, also Davey Mason, Perry, and other
mushrooms. “ Better the devil we know,
than the devil we don’t know.”
Bourke Ward. — Mr. Alexander Dean against all
comers. „ _
This is the straight Bulletin Ticket. The
fact that John Davies is left to be opposed by
mushrooms, is creditable neither to the courage
nor the claims of the party of reform in the Coun-
cil. A good man could beat him even now.

should have him embalmed, andlput in a coffin, and
stand him up in hia bone-box right alongside the
Speaker.

it is the home of millions of birds, who have a habit of
laying eggs, which go to waste for the want of eating,
nine-tentns of the cultivated land is devoted to onions;
most fruits, including spuds, grow luxuriantly. The
climate is mild, fiost unknown, and the inhabitants
never have to pray for rain. There are good fishing and

iiland as it is with a Lands Office clerk on the 30th of

doctors or lawyers—they won’t have them. “Linnceas ’
thinks Lord Howe’s Island would make a capital sana-
tor.nm for this colony, and he also suggests it should
he made a relief station for wrecked vessels, with a
smart schooner kept there, manned by Vernon boys.
The Vernon boys would cerainly learn more there than
moored off Cockatoo. The pamphlet would be very
useful to anyone who yearns to go to the “ Madeira of
the Pacific." We don’t intend going ourselves. We
don't care to go anywhere where dollars are scarce.
Ave Maria.
(FOR THE RULLETIN)
Ave Maria ! the night has come.
And the sullen winds are blowing,
I hear the sound of the muffled drum.
And the waters madly flowing;
They take him away who was my pride
To the grave in the forest lonely.
And now I feel that my love has died.
And that grief is left me only.
Ave Maria! the moon is high,
But the dark clouds fly before it;
The stars are lost in the misty sky,
As love in the heart that bore it;
The sound of the stream is sad and low.
Its song is changed to a wailing;
And hope, in the mind, has lost its glow.
And faith, in the soul, is failing.
Ave Maria! protect me now
From a thought beyond my bearing,
And temper my spirit that while I bow
I grow not too despairing ;
For the dreary shadow of Death has come.
And the winds of Grief are blowing,
I hear the sound of the muffled drum.
*nrl the waters madly flowing.

SCHOLASTIC.
A LADY offers to the sons of gentlemen a pleasant
healthy home in the immediate neighbourhood
of two of the most favourite Watering Places around
Sydney. The ages of pupils must not exceed twelve
years, except in the oast's of (1) boys whose education
has been neglected and (2) backward yontbs whose de-
ficiency would prevent their competing with more ad-
vaneed pupils ef the same age in higher schools, for
both of which classes the limit of age shall be extended
to IS years.
The School is strictly Primary and the Best Atten-
tion of the Principal shall be devoted not only to the
Scholastic Training of the Pupils placed under her
charge, but also to those home comforts so necessary
to the welfare of lads just leaving their parents’ roof.
Ths house is commodion* and beautifully situate—
fronting a Nicely Sheltered Bay, in which the boys can
enjoy Sea Bathing with Perfect Safety.
The Recreation Grounds are unusually large.
Oows to supply the boys with Fresh Milk and Butter
are kept, and an excellent pony which the pupils will
have the privilege of using.
Only a limited number of boys will be received.
First quarter to com mence on the 10th January next.
