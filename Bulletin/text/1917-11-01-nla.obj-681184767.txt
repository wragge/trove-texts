AFRAID OF FOOD.
Sufferers from Indigestion very often become faddists as regards their food, and find
themselves in time reduced to a very meagre and unsatisfying diet. Hudson’s
Eumenthol Jujubes correct acidity of the stomach, and their antiseptic properties
prevent abnormal fermentation of the
food, thus allowing the natural digestive
ferments to act, and if taken regularly
after meals they so improve the digestion
that a strict diet becomes unnecessary.
Hudson’s Eumenthol Jujubes are most
useful to those who suffer from Heart-
burn, Flatulence and Dyspepsia.

The Red Page
Thus the enlarged edition weakens by its
added verges the welcome that the first edi-
tion achieved and deserved. But it is a
beautiful edition, dignified by 16 noble ex-
amples of Norman Lindsay’s pen. Though
Lindsay has chosen the poorest poems to
illustrate, he has given these poems a new
life. Design, poetic conception, suavity and
vigor of line, and masterly execution give
separate value to this edition as a work of
art. For absolute and satisfying originality
of idea Norman Lindsay’s pictures rank
with the best of modern art. For the artist
has wisely pot “illustrated” the poems: he
has reconceived them in his own medium.
"Bram”: I tried the nursery-rimes on
my three kiddies, aged -3, 8 and 12. Three
approved of your two selections, but the
winner was “Five Grey Rabbits,” and next
to that “Tinkle, Tinkle, Telephone.” Eight
insisted on reading them over himself, after
Dad had finished, then voted for “Old Bob’s
Canter,” after that “Little Grey Bear,” then
“Captain Cook broke his hook.” These re-
sults suggest that for 3 you want sound
first, and if you can finish with a word like
“gobbled,” as in “Five Grey Rabbits,” you
have the perfect nursery rhyme. At eight
sound must be soused with sentiment. From
eight’s tone I think the “Little Grey Bear”
hit him most. Twelve we can ignore, he
was reading Gerard's story in the Sun. I
am sorry for the man in the trench, but
there’s one copy of The B. going to the
Front without its Red Page; a fellow can’t
learn them all—and three and I have a
nightly appointment at bedtime.
Australian Verse
In the enthusiastic notice given by this
page (7/6/T7) to Leon Geilert’s Songs of a
Campaign, attention was drawn to the fact
that the best work in the collection was that
done at the war. The ante-bellum pieces had
merely “a feminine felicity of melody”; in
his active-service work, “a new masculine
note sounds: the poet reacts almost vio-
lently to the reality of war”; while in his
post-bellum verses, “the mood has evapo-
rated : he slips back into his earlier manner,
play lug carelessly with abstractions of
Love and Death, far banished from reality.
The war has made him; the war has
broken him.” Now a third and en-
larged edition of Songs of a Campaign has
been issued, by Angus and Robertson, Syd-
ney, to confirm that verdict. The 25 addi-
tions to the first edition do not strengthen
Leon Gellert’s poetic appeal. His group of
new sonnets find him still playing with
abstractions: —
Sly Falsehood comes, with Sin, and Flat-
tery ....
Slobbering Lust is there, asmear with
slime. ...
And Murder takes his place amid the host. ..
Sick Peace is slain, and slaying War is
king!....
And lovely Peace smooth-gowned in lightest
grey
These commonplace personifications don’t
interest us; though in “Murder” there is a
macabre and impressive picture:—
Upon the threshhold red-eyed Murder stands,
Fresh from his slaughter-house of human
meat,
Blood on his broken teeth and on his hands,
Blood on his nails and on his purple feet.
With hollow voice he speaks, and sick’ning
breath,
“A way there is, that only way is
deathl....
The dead will rise no more, —the dead are
dead!
The spared will creep behind the sparer’s
back,
And breathe tlieir plots and stab. The dead
are dead!
And lie along the safe triumphal track.
The young-eyed babe will lisp its little tales.
_The loving girl will slay her man in bed
Kissing his savage mouth. The victor fails
At Mercy’s seat. The dead are safely
dead.”
Luckily there are now printed a few of
Ms war-impressions that failed to find place
in his first edition. These have the old fire:
these are the genuine Gellert. He has made
his sonnets; but “Poppies”—a vivid note of
battle —made itself. As this simple inci-
dent, seen or finely imagined from some sight
of poppies in Gallipoli, struck fire in the
poet’s brain, so in all its stark simplicity it
remains in the reader’s mind.
Some scarlet poppies lay upon our right.
Tie watched them through his periscope all
day.
He watched them all the day; hut in the
night
They seemed to pass away.
They came again much redder toith the
morn;
And still he gazed, and strangely longed
to roam
Among their savage splendor in the corn,
And ponder on his home.
And when the charge was done, they found
him there,
Deep in the redness, where he made his
stand,
With withered poppies in his twisted hair,
And poppies in his hand.
But Gellert has added little of mark to
those exquisite vignettes of the hospital; his
“Fever” and “The Home Delirious” lose
their impact by their length. Yet from the
ante-helium work one beautiful poem de-
serves rescuing into print.
COLD!
Gome not to me with loveliness
Across the crying hill;
For once I held tliec pitiless.
Hast thou no pity stillf
Come not to me with hot delight,
And touch this moveless clay,
Jjest my poor heart that knows the night
Awake and feel the day.
Gome not to me and kiss this head,
And heat me with thy fire;
For I am dead, and thou art dead;
And dead is my desire.
It’s name’s Doreen, and it’s by C. J.
Dennis, a shilling booklet daintily illus-
trated in color by Hal Gye, and published
by Angus and Robertson, Sydney. Four
samples of the familiar stuff, sure to be
snapped up by Billjim. Doreen is married
and a mother now,
The ’ope an' worry uv our lives was yellin’
fer ’is Mar.
And her Sentimental Husband thinks of
The days I thort I snared a saint; but since
Eve understood
I ’ave wed a dink urn ivonian, which is fifty
times as g00d ....
Fer I wed a real, live woman, wiv a woman’s
’appy knack
Uv torkin ’ reason inside out an’ logic front
to back.
Young Bill gets into trouble, cuts his finger
and comes home from school with a black
eye, “a bonzer mouse”; and the Sentimental
Father gets “sciatiker,” and finds that when
you’re ill your Doreen regards you as
’Er ’usband, an’ 'er patient, an’ ’er little
orpliin child.
It is all very pleasant, but one feels that
now C. J. Dennis could write these senti-
mental yarns in his sleep—and that he’s
getting tired of sentimental slang. Still,
there is a big Australian public Hint, isn't.
LEON GELLERT.
M. Hookey rewrites the Song of Solomon
as The Song (Monotone Art Printers,
Hobart). The author is not the first to
attempt this impossible feat: nor has M.
Hookey any fresh ideas about the plot or
meaning of this work of art. All that is
attempted is to “give fresh metrical form to
the verses,” whilst endeavoring to preserve
the spirit and beauty of the original. But
the beauty of the original is best preserved
in its original English form. Many of the
passages are as firmly fixed in our minds
as are quotations from Shakespeare; and
M. Hookey unavailingly tries to gild the lily
of the valley. Is it possible to improve the
quality of a passage such as this by any
fresh metrical form? —
For, 10, the winter is past,
'The rain is over and gone;
The flowers appear on the earth;
The time of the singing of birds is come,
And the voice of the turtle is heard in the
our land.
M. Hookey’s version rrns thus: —
For the rain is over-past,
And the winter gone at last,
And the turtle-dove doth ci’oon from out the
tree.
Where the young flowers deck the earth
And the birds sing loud their mirth
Merrily.
Spring cometh merrily.
Mere dilution. So the impressive simile,
terrible as an army with banners, is weakly
expanded into this :
Terrible is her beauty, and the hearts of men
Go down before
As when an army marcheth banner-led
To fields of war.
What is a modern bard to do with this? —
Now also thy breasts shall be as clusters of
grapes,
And the smell of thy nose like apples.
The Song of the Tasmanian Solomon calmly
omits it. And where the original singer
sang in imperishable words :—•
For love is strong as death;
Jealousy is cruel as the grave;
The coals thereof are coals of fire,
Which hath a most vehement flame.
Many waters cannot quench love,
Neither can the floods drown it......
M. Hookey baldly remarks: —.
Jealousy is cruel as the grave,
Fierce as the sword.
Fire are the flashes and the flames thereof
Fire of the Lord.
Love is the light of Life, its joy and crown,
Rivers of water shall not vanquish love
Nor oceans drown.
Sacrilege! This nakedly passionate Orien-
tal love-song, or love-drama, which so for-
tunately got bound up in the Old Testament,
and is still retained there with chapter
headings explaining that it expresses the
mutual love of Christ and his Church is too
beautiful a thing to be tampered with, even
by a Tasmanian.
Simple and true and touching and femi-
nine are the verses of Margery Ruth Betts,
Remembering and O.V. (Aust. Authors’
Agency, Melb., Is.). Her theme is the
young dead, slain in the war; and she treats
it naively and tenderly and all in the one
key.
’Twas just a dream of mine, my boy, and
you were never heeding,
You laughed, and said your mother was u the
sweetest girl you knew,”
But I, your mother, direamt a time when
someone would be needing
The little silly songs and rimes I used to
sing for y0u. ...
Oh, the little things, the silly things, a
tooman dreams of sayingf
And the .way that every woman knows of
kissing scratched knees well!
They’d have liked to rest on granny’s knees
when they wet'e tired of playing,
They’d have liked to hear the fairy tales that
granivy knew to te11....
Though many of her verses have these
felicitous and truthful touches, in few of
them is the emotion sustained. “The
Reckoning,” which begins forcibly thus:—
Drown the weeping with the guns, never
heed or hark,
Talk in millions if you will, yet you must
come to one,
You must hear a ivoman’s voice, wailing
down the dark,
“Kaiser of Germany, give me back my son!”
fails to justify the reader’s hopes. In her
sonnets the thought is more compact: they
gain by this compression but lose in per-
sonal intimacy. But this is emphatically a
book for mothers, for mothers who have lost,
or fear to lose, their fighting sons. This
page selects for quotation, “Primrose Time,”
despite its lack of Australian flavor, as the
most intimately-touching of this sheaf of
poignant remembrances.
“ Mother, when the winds of Bpring shall
blow again to you,
When they bring you from the woods a waft
of violets blue,
Don’t you let that hurt you, for the hands
that used to bring,
When those hands were only little, your first
flowers of Spring.
“When the happy meadow grass is dancing
in the breeze,
When the lambs are in the fields and nests
are in the trees,
When you pass a lonely child a-chattering
at his play,
Do not wish that you were blind nor turn
another way.
“When t\e blackbird’s singing in the lilac by
the gate,
Singing through the twilight or the sunlight
to his mate,
Do not rise and leave your work to shut the
open door —•
You must love the Springtime still, but you
must love it more.
u When the darling primroses are coming
home again,
When you see them peeping at you going
down the lane,
Don't you catch your breath up, dear, .Mr
turn away your head.
Nor feel you cannot bear to look, because
your boy is dead.
“Oh, the English primroses in an English
lane!
I it was who died, my dear, to bring them
back again,
Back to happy English soil, where English
Springs go free —
So don’t you be a-slighting them that come
to you from me.”
Australian Kiddy Fiction
In the provision of stories for children
Australian writers occupy a high D i aP p.
three new volumes confirm that oninim,’
Isabel Maud l’eacocks, with two excelled
books to her credit, follows us with Patricia
Pat (Ward. Lock). This, however, is 2
a book not for a child, but about a child-
and it lacks the simplicity that gave tße
charm to her earlier studies of childhood
Patricia Pat's story is subsidiary to a grown’
up love-affair—and grown-up love-affairs are
quite boring to a kid. And the author should
not write about things she does not know
there is one chapter, in which the hero goes
aeroplaning in Flanders, which quite fails
to convince. And with a Maoriland locale
she gives us no impression of an interesting
background. For a girl of 15, however, the
book is readable; but it is not distinguished.
S
Ethel Turner remains at the head of
writers in this genre. Her Captain Cub
(Ward, Lock) is the inevitable sequel to
The Cab. And as the cub grows swiftly to
manhood at the Front, so this sequel appeals
to an older audience. It is a war novel-
but Ethel Turner shows her readers many
familiar and- unfamiliar aspects of Australia
in war-time. She takes us to Burrinjuck
and Yanco. and neatly shows ns the frauds
practised upon charitable dispensers of war
funds. She wisely trusts to soldiers’ letters
for the ground work of her war themes; and
her cub’s letters have all the matter-of-fact-
ness and disdain of romance that charac-
terise Billjim. Ethel Turner’s distinctive
charm lies in her ability to touch her reader
with an unexpected and delicate pathos.
Jt
Mary Grant Bruce, with her ninth book
for Australian kiddies, ranks among the
best of our children's storytellers, ller
kiddies are the real Australian article: she
does not deal in heroics; she possesses suffi-
cient humor; and she knows her Australia.
Her latest, ’Possum (Ward, Lock), is the
story of a family who, for the health of a
sickly son, had to live in the bush. Their
difficulties and disappointments are not
glossed over. ’Possum is the delightful
daughter of a neighboring selector, the
youthful foster-mother of a mob of younger
brothers and sisters, and the best driver of
a plough in the district, with a philosophy
of her own. “Men always have a heap to
talk about, don’t they? Well, you can’t
blame ’em; but it’s a good thing women
aren’t like that in the bush. They simply
wouldn’t have time. It’s a funny thing—no
matter how busy a man is, he’s always got
time to prop up a gate an’ yarn if any other
man comes along. But a woman just can’t
—she’d think of the dinner not cooked, an’
the spuds not dug, an’ the washin’-up not
done, an’ like as not no wood for the fire if
she didn’t cut it herself, an’ the kids’ pants
not patched. An’ they’re all things that
can’t be left, ’cause men expects to be fed,
an’ if you leave pants when they begin to
need patchin’, there’s mighty soon no pants
to patch.” A healthy book, without a trace
of mawkishness.
J*
There is one palpable weakness for the
Australian reader in the whole series of our
kiddy stories: they are illustrated by English
artists; and these artists give no evidence of
any familiarity with Australian or M.L.
flora or scenery; and the characters they
picture are English. From a glance at the
illustrations the reader would assume that
these were stories of England. The pub-
lishers are herebj’ informed that Australia
has illustrators that can do work as good or
better, and work that would be as Australian
as the stories.
— «
Happy—Though Wounded! is one of the
cheeriest publications of the war; yet it is
the production of the 3rd London General
Hospital, selections from the contributions
of orderlies, patients, doctors and nurses to
the hospital Gazette. Illustrations and
letterpress are delightful. Though the
wounded private is not outclassed, the artis-
tic contributors number members of the Chel-
sea Arts Club, who, unable to go to the
Front, volunteered as orderlies. Celebrated
painters and sculptors, as corporals and ser-
geants, contribute; and among them we meet
Australian names like Streeton, Fullwood,
Tom Roberts, Vernon Lorimer. The profits
of this brilliant book, an excellent ham
crown’s worth, go to the Benevolent Fund
of the hospital.
Our thanks are due to R. H. Croll, the author of
one of the nursery rimes printed on this page, tor
pointing out a misprint. The last line was inad-
vertently made to read: “This year’s petticoats, next
year’s pants,” whereas the sense is quite differenc
when correctly printed, thus: —
Sonny boy, sonny boy, just me and you.
Here’s a little jacket, here’s a little j^hoe.
Daddy’s gone to fight for him, far away in Frans*.
This year petticoats, next year pants.

Look to Your Teeth.
There are no teeth like those furnished by
Nature. For service, comfort and good
health artificial teeth cannot be com-
pared with a natural set.
Sensible people will accordingly try to pre-
serve their teeth as long as possible by
keeping them clean. Cold water and soap
and w T ater are useful, but are somewhat
ineffectual. Rough powders, such as cuttle-
fish, crabseyes, crude chalks and charcoal
are too severe on the enamel.
EUDENTA TOOTH PASTE is scientifi-
cally prepared to clean the teeth, sweeten
the breath, harden the gums and disinfect
the mouth (thus preventing decay).
EUDENTA is therefore regarded as “the
perfection of dental luxuries.” 1/- tube every-
where. Post free, 1/3. Free sample posted.

A Natural Remedy
Time was when disease was thought to be due to the
direct influence of evil spirits, and exorcism and magic
were invoked to cast it out.
Science has taught us wisdom. The evil spirits exist
still. We call them “Disease Germs,” and they also
must be cast out. Once lodged in the stomach or
intestines, fever with its hallucinations, or biliousness with
its aches and pains, is the result.
ENO S FRUIT SALT’
is the approved remedy for driving out disease germs.
Its action is quick and thorough. It clears the intestines,
rouses the torpid liver to new life, stimulates the mucous
membrane to a healthy action, and cleanses and invigorates
the whole digestive tract.
Be prepared for emergencies by always keeping &
bottle in the house. *

These wise old walls, whose rainbow rows

Immortal passions spill.

The deathless human will.
The hopes of earth, the tasks of Time are
here,
Conflicts and moods of men.
ho at a message from my mind appear
And move and live again.
Through pools and passages of woven light
This age and that comes down,
And sings, or struggles in a storied fight,
Of red and rare renown.
Treasures and argosies of Yesterday
Sail on before my eye;
Dove-lidded ladies on their citherns plav,
As plaintive lovers sigh.
Young, naked nymphs with night-tinged hair,
beneath
The olive branches sing.
An olden urn or grassy-broidered wreath
\\ ithin their hands they string.
Hush-hurried down a creaking, oaken stair,
Some gentle maiden glides.
The sleening swallow dreams upon the air,
As with her love she rides.
Tall, vermeil figures on an arras fold
Their perfect, placid hands,
While dulcet tongues behind the fringing
gold
Tell tales of magic lands.
With sabres reddening the autumn air
The moving armies march ;
Or swiftly raise unto the trumpets’ blare
The proud, triumphal arch.
These were realities. They come and go
In breathing books to-day.
Through some maid’s mind our crowded age
shall glow,
Word-bound in dreams, as they.

The Deathless Soul.
That day at last has come for me
When I no more need suffer pain
Nor see the useless misery
On friendly faces fall again.
And through the broken crest of Death
There comes the curving tide of Spring,
The swift sweet Southern clover breath
Of Love and Life unperishing.
The doves are on the warm red roofs,
The sky is like a deep blue well
With trees reflected ; hark, what hoofs
Are those? And whose that tolling bell?
I see the nodding plumes below,
And o’er the muffled sound of feet
I hear the whispering screws that go
To hold one in his winding-sheet.
Not mine, not mine that stony face.
Those knotted thumbs above the breast.
And yet, God wot, there is no place
Other on earth where I may rest.
They take him down the creaking stairs,
Three stalwart men on either hand ;
Adown into the crystal airs
Of sunshine where the horses stand.
They thrust him in the dismal coach,
Heap lilies on his wooden shell;
The graveyard gates give wide approach,
The withered sexton rings his knell.
They sink him in a crumbling pit
And draw the turf across his head,
The parson croaks from Holy Writ
A benediction on the dead.
And at the setting of the sun,
When small red stars inflame the sky,
The mother and her little one
Come wending homeward wearily.
I meet them at the half-shut door,
And. though I lead them ’mid the gloom,
They hear no steps upon the floor,
Nor guess my presence in the room.
I kiss the child who only feels
The wind go ruffling through her hair
Up the blind passage till it reels
Back with a sigh of sick despair.
They cannot look with love on me
A thing alive with breath of G0d....
Would that my soul might die and he
Bride o’ my flesh heneatli the sod!

If I Should Live.
While kingdoms crash and heroes die,
Earth still smiles gaily through her tears.
What portents new will star the sky,
If I should live to eighty years?
There is an end of everything;
Even love knows dropsy, it appears.
Will joy still smile at me and sing,
If I should live to eighty years?
Just thirty-two (alas!) will be
The babe who now my soul endears.
Will she still coax with dimpled glee,
If I should live to eighty years?
Boy Hope has somehow lost the breeze,
And, ah, the devious course he steers!
What tide will bear my argosies,
If I should live to eighty years?
God. just to live. . . .how sweet it is!
Ah, grant me. undeterred by fears,
Still strength to kick mine enemies,
If I should live to eighty years?

THE BANQUET.
Between to-day and next week multitudi-
nous Australian citizens, in private conversa-
tion, letters to the newspapers, speeches at
meetings of patriotic funds and exhorta-
tions to young men to get into new suits,
will groan heavily over “the apathy of the
public about the war.” Probably they do not
quite know what they mean or wish to con-
vey, unless it be a general protest against
the bungling they have been compelled to
watch in the conduct of public policy. _ Cer-
taijilv it is not true that the Australian is
indifferent about the war. Too many of his
sons are under arms, the black camel has
halted at too many gates, for such an allega-
tion to be taken seriously. What these
people who talk about apathy are doing is
10 make the cowardice of Australian Govern-
ments and Parliaments the test of national
feeling. That apathy exists in this direction
is the tragedy of the Commonwealth. Not
only do these Parliaments, in spite of the
brave words hurled at Germans by garrulous
office-holders and loquacious job-hunters, dis-
play deplorable apathy in relation to the
war. but to the domestic interests of the
country they show a lazy unconcern amount-
ing to treachery. The fighting is not the only
thing the Australian people are concerned
about. Associated with it are problems that
go to the very heart of our national exist-
ence. And how are they being handled? By
being smuggled away out of sight—obscured
by a chicanery which has used the patience
and patriotism of the people as instruments
for their own exploitation. Possibly our
form of government may be to blame for
this. The certain thing is that the sloth and
inefficiency of politicians encourage the Aus-
tralian people to go on believing that when
the war is over they will still be able to lean
up against the old man, make a leisurely in-
spection of the damage and send for a remit-
tance to carry on with. This i effects an
apathy quite 'as calamitous as that which
provokes contempt when m-tlie-\\ ar Gov-
ernments justify their policy by snoring in
public places. # »
This paper has expressed its opinion of
the so-called war policies of Australian Gov-
ernments often enough, and hopes to do it
with a greater freedom when rules and regu-
lations permit. Meantime it wants to again
warn Australia that, though the muddling ot
the Federal authority has been redeemed by
the valor of the Commonwealth troops and
may not in the end materially affect the
result of the struggle, the attitude of the
Federal and State Governments towards in-
dustrial and financial affairs threatens every
man and woman on the continent with seri-
ous consequences. Every Ministry looks the
same. They are all sitting like a row of
Micawbeks waiting for what may happen
next, and incoherently jabbering about the
prevailing prosperity and the astonishing
capacity of the country to bear the strain of
war. Let no Australian be mistaken. It is
not prosperity these people see about them.
The country is not bearing the strain of war
in any legitimate sense. What we are doing
is to accumulate a gigantic debt, and doing
it not only for war. While this new r debt
goes on leaping upwards, the earning power
of the older debt is rapidly shrinking; and
while the weight on the taxpayers becomes in-
creasingly great, millions upon millions of in-
vested capital are being relieved from bearing
a share of the burden. While this unpictu-
resque pile continues to grow and the indus-
try and productive power of the future are
consumed in advance, the stupendous pro-
blem of what Australia is going to do about
it is answered (1) by the State Governments
battling to make the debt still bigger ; (2) by
the Federal Parliament casually remarking
that the time seems ripe for doing nothing;
(3) by the public going on strike or to the
races; and (4) by all hands giving three
cheers for the encouragement of unfertile
loquacity about everything in general. It all
makes a picture of Democracy at its worst
at any rate, of a democracy helpless in the
clutches of party place-hunters, and served
by factions demoralised to the point of irre-
sponsibility.
* * * *
The heresy that there is virtue in mud-
dling through has gripped the Australian
politician body and soul. But the people
cannot hope to escape the bill; it always
has to be paid for, this madness. And
while Australia goes on towards the bill-
living upon hot air, getting deeper and
deeper in the slough of debt, with the cer-
tainty of having to face a new life and a
new world —where are those individuals who
not long ago were raging about the land-
scape proclaiming a greater patriotism than
that of their fellows? Apparently the
Prime Minister of Australia believes that
he discharges his obligations to the nation
by making rambling remarks about the war,
issuing interminable regulations, gagging the
press tighter every week, and carrying on “a
series of big commercial transactions.
Never was there failure more abject to tread
the path of duty. If Australia was called
upon by the act of a foreign enemy to exert
all her strength in defence of her liberties,
that summons demanded that she should jeal-
ously protect herself against the dissipation
of her resources for any other purpose. A hen
war broke out the country was up to its
neck in debt, revelling in the extravagances
of a loan-promoted “prosperity” by which
every Parliament in the land had been so
demoralised that it had become an auto-
matic vote-buying machine. Since then
there has been a desperate struggle to keep
the old foolishness going. To protect the
remaining credit of the country ; to. econo-
mise in order that the cost of war might be
more effectively met; to bring the national
appetite within the boundaries of the nation’s
ability to produce and pay for what it con-
sumed —no effort has been made to do any of
these things in the Federal sphere or else-
where. Public and private extravagances
of the grossest kind have been encouraged;
the national resources have been looted in
order to escape for a day or two the conse-
quences of the war. There is a wild humor
about all this, of course, and behind it a
grim tragedy. No one can seriously pre-
tend to say what the world will be like at
the end of the war or to know what the
prevailing conditions are going to be a year
or two after. But it is easy to see what
the world is not going to be like, and to
guess at the conditions which will be absent.
Lloyd George was talking the other day of
the time when Britain would put her “sad
and exhausted house in order.” Australia
will have the same job on hand, embittered
by the calamity that a great part of the
exhaustion will be owing to the indifference
of its politicians to everything but their
own immediate gains. Whether people or
politicians like it or not, they will have no
chance then of living as they are living to-
day, by hypothecating the future, letting
the questions of debt and production go
hang, maintaining a political super-struc-
ture which in extravagance and incompe-
tence is one of the curiosities of the world.
It will then be open to the politician and his
supporter to apathetically proceed to tidy
up or get really busy. And as there is a
public debt in view of well over £600.000,000
the consequences of being apathetic about
it may be rather serious—much more
serious than being indifferent about it
now seems to be. The long, loafing
lean-up against the post has got to
end soon, and when it does end The
Bulletin is hopeful that the cheerful opti-
mist of to-day and the State loan-monger
will gird up their loins and explain the
advantages which in the end have been
derived by the populace from the prolonged
national drunk and shirk.
DEMOCRACY AND IMAGINATION.
A practical imagination is perhaps the
greatest asset of humanity in its effort to
keep on this planet and get something worth
while out of the business of living. It is
the source of all invention and in some rudi-
mentary way it forms the basis on which
evolution works. Not evep the primal cell
could have advanced a stage had there not
been somewhere in its loose intelligence a
misty picture of bettered conditions. But
imagination on the human plane is _ a
thing vastly different from the instinctive
imagination of lower forms of life; and.
while every forward thought of longing or
desire has in it some element of imagination,
the term is only used for the bigger pictorial
sense which can make worlds of dream
beyond the world of actuality. I ractma
imagination goes still farther than this , to
the thing of dream it fashions has roads or
dream leading to it so weH paved with
thought and experience that the dreamer
can drive his cart of reality down them, sure
of getting to his visioned goal if somebody
doesn’t put obstacles in his way. Obviously,
the practical imagination of a nation or
thinking men must lead rapidly to g re &t
results if those obstacles could be kept ott
the track. The chief difficulty, however, lies
just here. The imaginings of one cross the
tracks of the imaginings of another; and as
they drive along the various roads of pur-
pose and seeming opportunity they come
violently into collision, until whole regions
of thought are piled up with wreckage, xue
discouragement of thought-enterprise through
this cause is very great. From piles ot
mined hopes the practical mind is thrown
back upon itself and begins to distrust alto-
gether the lure of dreams that seemed fair
and easy enough of realisation. A few, with
more steadfastness or cunning, merely re-
adjust their ideas and concentrate their
imaginings on the tracks likelv to be taken
by the other fellow, or trim the edges of
their vision, and, taking a shorter road,
accept a poorer result as a compromise
between their need and their desire. So, in
spite of all failures and discouragements,
practical imagination still has some success.
It is that which has given us our modern
advances in the realm of mechanical inven-
tion, has once or twice solved our gravest
political' problems, and. wrongly and bitterly
applied, has deluged the world with blood
and tears.
* * * *
In the big held of politics, which is the
held of national endeavor, the great and
desirable thing is co-operative imagination.
Every individual has his dreams whether he
makes an attempt to realise them or not:
but the imagination of nations has hardly
yet passed beyond the sluggish, half-blind
movement of the primal cell o.n the upward
track towards manhood or godhead, or what-
ever the ultimate goal of evolution may be.
Nations have done great things for good
and evil; but in doing them they have been
following the imaginings of the few in the
lead, or the kings and princes set over them,
rather than the united vision of the people
thinking as a whole. The madness of tier-
many, which, in 1914. ordered out the
material for the ruin of civilisation, was no
result of the dreamings of the German
nation. If the concentrated vision of the
Teuton peoples could have been made into
a single picture it would probably have
amounted to no more than an emblematic
Fritz sitting in perpetuity with an emblem-
atic Hans in a shady beer-garden listening
to good music, smoking virulent tobacco
from long pipes, drinking fathomless pots
of lager, and in the intervals of the band
concert discussing philosophy, while a
buxom Gretciien hovered near looking with
motherly regard at two fat infants who
would never be called upon to render mili-
tary service. The essential practical imagin-
ing of the general Teuton mind, in which
were focussed the general hopes, would have
gone little farther than that. But Germany
had never asserted her right to think or
imagine as a nation ; and so the job remained
to Wilhelm to let his mind play on the
possibilities of world-slaughter for world-
glory. That the Kaiser tried to force his
own imaginings on the people long before
the war is plain enough. Every effort was
made to star before the eyes of Fritz and
llans the thing that their political head
saw; and the vision splendid of an all-
conquering Germany whose brief march
through blood —the other fellow’s blood —
was to be crowmed with. boundless sausage
and infinite lager did to a large extent im-
press the Teuton multitudes. But such a
vision would never have sprung from the
multitudes themselves. Their natural imagin-
ing would never have included in its scope
a shambles nor the stern discipline of mili-
tary life, with the sterner glory of a military
death as something more than a sporting
chance. And Democracies, even when
moderately free, have beyond a certain defi-
nite point shown no more united and prac-
tical imagination than peoples under
autocratic government. The vision of
freedom has come to enslaved peoples: the
grand tornado of Man blowing down thrones
and despotisms has sounded in their dream-
ing ears. But when the wreckage of the
bad was complete their mental picture of
the reconstruction of the good has never been
sufficiently clear and definite to lead them
into the larger places possible to united
nationhood. The French revolutionaries
saw much ; the French republicans saw little.
That is why Napoleon was able to come
along and supply the imagination the nation
lacked. If it was not the national imagina-
tion it was at least so far constructive
through destruction as to seem worth folio wr-
ing. In all history the co-operative practical
imagination of the mass of men has failed ;
and. the chief cause of its failure has been
the habit of trusting to leadership to do the
thinking.
* • * *
But the days change rapidly, the more
rapidly for the war-blast which is burning
and destroying; and there is always the
hope of better things. In the practical
imagination of democracy lies the world's
best chance. Here in Australia there is
tremendous scope for it; and indeed there
is scope for very little else.' We have been
trusting as all men trusted in the past to
leadership. The only indication of national
imagination has been that shown by a few
politicians; the only indication of even
sectional or party imagination has been that
of the bosses of a few cliques. habor’s
vision has beeu that of a few Trades Hall
secretaries ; and industrial dreams have been
limited to the thoughts of a man here and
there who held the purse-strings. Yet as
individuals the people have been thinking
finely. Men in wild places by the smouldering
camp fire have seen the vision glorious of all
that Australia might be. The man-in-the-
train will frequently outline a better policy
for the Commonwealth than any p.olitician
dares to suggest. Even if the united dream
of the nation is not very wide in its sweep,
it is at least very sweet and wholesome; and
with encouragement it can grow and expand.
For the business of seeing visions and
dreaming dreams is no idle amusement of the
brain, but can be set to the great tunes of
purpose. It is as much a man’s work as an-
other —indeed, without it man’s best work
is a poor thing. Above all, Australia needs
an imaginative policy for the future. Tint
policy, after a long test, our alleged states-
men and politicians have failed to give us
If it is to come at all it must come from
the people and not from their so-called
leaders. To invent machinery that will
focus the public imagining and give reality
to the public dream is the first need of the
hour. The road seems to be plain enough
Primary Government by which the people
as a whole are made their own legislators
is the first step ; and the Referendum with
Initiative, which stood as a plank of Labor's
platform, but which has been steadily
shelved by Labor’s unimaginative leaders, is
the one thing necessary to bring the public
to grips with its own job. Then the prac-
tical public imagination gets its chance. Any
group of men seeing the thing that they
believe must be done can set the machine in
motion. Instead of having to persuade
politicians that there is something in what
they see, they can make direct demand for
a Referendum; and if there are enough
people in the Commonwealth who have the
same vision, the thing they have seen
immediately takes practical shape. If
democracy is essentially good, if the majority
of men will follow truth and beauty and
honesty yvhen they see them. Primary Gor-
ernment opens the road of progress and
reform. By its application the mind of the
nation at once becomes flexible; and as the
thing exercised develops to strength and
fitness for its job, the big national imaginings
of the future can be in no doubt. It is
Australia’s chance. Other things have
failed us bitterly. Our imported ideas grow
muddy, our imported dreams fail to fit: but
we have yet to test the greatest of all our
national possessions— ourselves.
SPECULATIONS.
[From Essays in Australian History, published
199-}.]
This mountainous island of Tasmania,
measuring roughly 150 miles in any trans-
verse diameter of its heart-shaped periphery
set on the southern edge of the great con-
tinental shelf of Australia, swept by the
moisture-laden breezes thrown off from the
“roaring forties,” and blessed with vast
wealth in minerals and hydraulic power, is
the true Cinderella of Australian national
and commercial development.
Prior to the Great Regeneration which
followed upon the return of the Australian
veterans at the close of the Great War. and
their uncompromising settlement of the civic
chaos of that period which forms so notable
a page in general Australian history, the
position of Tasmania was a curious one.
With a population of about 200,000, the
country had for years been dominated by a
legislative oligarchy of aged reactionaries,
which held, by a mixture of guile and in-
ertia. the balance of power between tin'
warring political parties of the ostensible
initiative chamber. The result was to be
seen in land laws which forced young men
out of the country, in the development of
veiled monopolies which held all industry in
an iron grip, and in the cultivation of in-
sular prejudices within and of amused con-
tempt from without. Stud sheep, apples,
jam and copper were the staple products of
the island. Exploited cunningly by its aged
rulers it was a cosmos in a teacup, with
all the expensive and cumbrous machinery
of a self-governing country. Attempts to
secure disinterested progress or genuine
national development were dexterously and
systematically drowned. It was but natural,
therefore, that the clear-cut purposes of the
national leaders of the early 1920’5, backed
by armed men who had won an imperishable
name on the bloodsoaked battlefields or
Europe, should cut through the rotten roots
of this national upas-tree in a few swat
strokes and enable the Dame of an uplifted
Australian spirit to sweep away the poison-
ous growth in its entirety.
Withering under its mephitic shades, but
still vital, were some of the seedlings which
have since grown to such noble stature.
The first hydro-electric developments had
begun 10 years or more before, and despite
constant snarlings and growlings at the pro-
gressive management, had continued to exist:.

same regrets would be felt by those strug-
gling farmers of 1917 who had spent their
lives in tilling the soil xvithout the assistance
of accumulator-driven locomotive machinery
or systematised water supply.

Although in this latter respect a similar
xvastage of human effort xvent on in other
parts of the Australian CommonxA*ealth, the
change is more evident in Tasmania for the
reason that the means for producing it were
so obviously in evidence. The only obstacles
in the way xvere the senile plutocrats who
feared all progress lest it should disturb
their peace and bring in the “foreigners”
from across Bass Straits. To the observer
of Tasmania to-day, xvith its great popula-
tion rendering it a very hive of industry, and
its deepxvater ports making it the chief col-
lecting and distributing centre in Australia
for deepxvater sea-traffic, the jealous and
senile oligarchs of the second decade of the
twentieth century seem as remote and bar-
barous as the robber barons of the mediaeval
Rhine, until he recollects that only txvo
generations separated them from the xvhist-
ling lash and clanking chain-gangs.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Child Endowment Scheme.
Dr. Arthur states his case
Justice Heydon fixed the standard family at a
man, his xx-ife and two children, and on that deter-
mined the basic living xvage as a sum sufficient to
supply these xvith the bare necessities of life. After
they got the plainest of food and the minimum of
clothing and shelter, there xvas nothing over.
Suppose, then, that another child arrives, xvhat
happens? Shelter and clothing cannot be further
cut down because they are already at bedrock. The
food supply has to be attacked. To fill the nexv
mouth someone has to go short, and it is usually the
mother and children, because the man has to get
sufficient food to enable him to do his xvork.
But suppose, instead of one extra, there are five or
six or seven, xx’hat then? There are hundreds of
such families to-day eking out a miserable existence
on the £2 15s. 6d. wage, and my proposal is the
only practicable scheme that has yet emerged for
dealing xvith so scandalous a stffte of affairs.
Some say, Pay a decent xvage. Well, a minimum
xvage for a family of 10 xvould be £4 ss. 6d., allow-
ing ss. for each child after the second. But if that
is to be fixed as the basic living xvage for the Com-
monwealth, then it must be paid to the single man
equally as to the father of eight. AVhat happens?
The unprotected industries collapse, the protected
pay their way by passing on the extra charge, the
cost of living goes up corresponding!}’, and you are
where you xvere, only more so!
Another alternatix’e is to teach the man on the
basic xvage the precepts of neo-Malthusianism, and
warn him that he xvill be punished if he dares to
exceed the two-child limit. If he proves an apt
pupil this xvill be the end of Australia ; for the
txvo-child family spells national suicide. Any com-
munity xvhich holds that size of family up as the
ideal is doomed to rapid extinction. Even xvith an
average three-child family a community xvould
barely hold its own in population. The true patriots
are they xvho are prepared to exceed that number;
and the mother of a numerous progeny should be a
figure of honor in Australia, xvhere there is such
bitter need for more people.
But she xvants more than honor. She xyantS money
to help to feed her offspring and to ease the in-
cessant strain upon herself.
My scheme at least does something toxx’ards this.
I impose a tax on every income over £2 a week,
and double it in the ease of single persons. It is
collected easily and economically. Ordinary income-
tax payers have it added to their other income tax,
while xvage-earners at present exempt pay by receipt-
stamps on the weekly xvage. I calculated tiiat under
this scheme one xvealthv bachelor in N. S. Wales
would be the vicarious father of over 300 children.
It is a sound doctrine that in Australia those xxdio
have no children, xvhether from choice or otherwise,
should pay their quota towards insuring tiiat every
child in the community should get food sufficient to
develop it physically and mentally, xvhich thousands
of children do not obtain to-day.
If there is a better xvay than mine, let it be
brought forward. If not, then let all xvho have the
welfare of the Australian child at heart stand beside
me, and bring this greatest of reforms about.
Pretty well all of Dr. Arthur’s premises
have to be admitted. But the money? For
N. 8. Wales alone the scheme xvould cost
£3,000,000 a year. Within a couple of
years, if it were applied only to the Ma
State, it would cost £4,000,000; for
“Mother of Ten” would soon he detected
crossing the borders with her brood. In
principle it may he just as proper to pay
maintenance to every father of three or
more young Rilljims as it is to pay the
“baby bonus” to every mother, xvhether
affluent or poor. But there is a practical
side to the matter. We can see millions
ahead of us in taxation. lloav can we face
further taxation running into millions for
the maintenance of the children of the afflu-
ent? For the point is not to be lost sight
of that the main consideration is the feed-
ing and care of the child. This money is
uot primarily a reward to the parents for
any special virtue. On the contrary, it is
ceitam that large families often occur in
conjunction xvith thriftlessness and. in
general, a low grade of citizenship. More
or less connected with that circumstance is
the grave doubt xvhether the ss. per
'7,, P & M as Dr. Arthur proposes
would be doing its best possible work. It
is certain, at any rate, that the -£5 paid by
way of baby bonus is to a very great extent
wasted by being handed direct to the parents,
h rom the national point of view, certainly,
tai greater value would be got if the money
xyere pooled and provision thereby made for
the proper care of the mother before, dur-
ing and after childbirth. As a medical
inan Dr. Arthur isn’t likely to dispute
tms. And it is highly probable that pre-
cisely the same thing can be said regarding
his proposed ss. Handed out as he suggests
it will do very little compared with what the
money might be made to do if it were used
in some co-operative xvay.
Legislation by Under-Secretaries.
“Sub-Sec. 2” : Some time ago Justice Pring
(N.S.W.), xvho had been moved on in the
street under some by-laxv of xvhich he was
not aware, drexv attention to the impossibility
of keeping track of all these regulations.
This year the State’s Parliament has passed
about six Acts; the rules and regulations for
the same period (as supplied to me by my
law-book publishers) take up 308 pages of
close type, and this xvithout including muni-
cipal ordinances. In 1916 the Parliament
passed the Workmen’s Compensation Act, a
fairly simple and shortystatute consisting of
19 sections. Then the Government official
drifted on to the scene and supplemented the
measure xx'ith 87 rules and 64 forms. Some
of the rules contain as many as 15 sub-
clauses. The unfortunate xvorkman has no
chance xvhatever of finding his xvay through
this mass. Even this extraordinary total of
rules does not represent their full bulk,
because they are to be “read and construed
xx-ith the District Court rules 1914.” As a
laxvyer I should no doubt be xvelcoming a
state of things xvhich makes it absolutely
necessary for a xvorkman to come along xvith
his guinea every time he is injured, but I
think that the profession doesn’t con-
sider this a fair thing. Many years ago Par-
liament instituted the District Court pro-
cedure as a cheap half-xvay house betxveen
the police courts and the Supreme Court.
Steadily there xvas created a maze of rules
until District Court procedure is the most
difficult in N. S. Wales. It xvas Robert
Louis Stevenson, I think, xvho said that
after having worked for centuries for our
liberties xx r e xvere busy throxving them a xvay
with both hands. The other day a depart-
mental by-law xvas issued which made it an
offence to fish from a national bridge. Some
busy under-secretary had made a criminal of
the youth xvho throws a line into the Darling
at Bourke from the bridge. Someone else made
it an offence to put an inscription on a tomb-
stone in a cemetery xvithout first submitting
it to the managers. Thousands of others of
these “verbotens” could be gathered from the
overwhelming mass of departmental legisla-
tion. The remedy is to make it the duty of
somebody—say the Parliamentary draftsman
—to issue a certificate in every case to the
effect that the reg, atijn proposed is neces-
sary in the interests of public safety and
contains a minimum of provisions. At
present regulations merely have to be laid
on the table of Parliament—an empty form.

A Battle of Lightweights.
If Elm sue, leader of the Victorian Labor
party, had nothing to do in the election cam-
paign raging on his side of the Murray but
shoxx’ up the shoddy record of Peacock, he
would have an easy job. But general elections
demand something more than this, and it is
certain that the conditions in Victoria re-
quire attacking xvith an axe instead of with
vague xvords. Elmslie, hoxvever, clings
hopefully to xvords. He opened the cam-
paign last xveek xvith a speech outlining
xvliat the Labor party has to offer as an
alternative to Peacoekism, and it all boiled
doxvn to a collection of nebulous phrases and
shadowy promises. As an experiment in
vote-catching here and there the effort may
serve its purpose in these lazy days. As a
contribution to the discussion of great pub-
lic questions it puts us no for’arder than a
discourse by the parish curate on sin.
Elmslie speaks sanely enough and is xvell-
meaning. But he is timid as a hare and
full of xvind. The cost-of-living problem
bulks largely in his eye. Very properly he
wants to see this thing dealt xvith. He pro-
mises to do the dealing. IIow? Well, after
a lot of xvhirling denunciation he gets to the
crux of the business and announces that
“the time lias arrived for the appointment
of a tribunal to regulate the price of food-
stuffs.” What sort of a tribunal is to do
the regulating? On xvhat basis is it to
regulate? What guarantee has he that the
producer of food xvill go on producing, or
xvliat protection has he to offer the con-
sumer against xvhat happened lately in N. S.
Wales when the regulators got to xvork?
Everything is left to the imagination of the
voter. In all probability Elmslie himself
has no ideas on the subject. It is enough for
him that the people are exasperated at the
cost of living. This gives him an opportu-
nity to play on their credulity, and “appoint-
ing a tribunal” comes as an easy suggestion
for setting matters right. Tested by this,
Elmslie is as shalloxv as Peacock. The
cost of living is xvithout a doubt a probleip
Australia has to deal xvith. But it isn’t a
problem relating only to food. Other things
show even a bigger increase in price than
chops and tomato-sauce. This might suggest
to Elmslie that there are causes at work
producing a general rise in prices; and if
Elmslie incites somebody to fix the prices
of food, he merely attempts to interfere with
an effect while leaving the cause untouched
—xvhich inevitably means failure. The
curse of the Labor party in Australia has
been the so-called leader who, instead of
trying to educate the xvorkers and face
difficulties, has been content to tell them
xvhat he has judged would be most likely to
tickle their ears. He has been a vote-
catcher, above all things, not a reformer;
and, instead of profiting by the horrible
results in N. S. Wales, for instance, Elms-
lie is content to go on the same track. It
is all very disheartening.
Politics in the West.
The leaders of the Westralian ‘(National”
Government claim the result of the general
elections as a victory for Lefroy and his
folloAvers, despite the defeat of Thomas,
Minister for Agriculture, and Scaddan, who
Avas Minister for Mines and Railways in
the original team. If the Official Labor
crowd comprises the entire Opposition which
Lefroy will have to face, then he will cer-
tainly command a majority of about 35 in a
House of 50. But an outstanding feature
of the election campaign was the reluctance
of candidates to carry the Government ticket.
Most of them Avere Nationalists Avith a quali-
fication. There were “Liberal Nationalists,”
“Country Party Nationalists,” “National
Laborites” and “Independent Nationalists,”
with only txvo or three for whom the plain
National tag was sufficient. The opening
speech of Premier Lefroy (who xvas unop-
posed) Avas not an inspiring slogan, although
it made a large hole in the space of the
West Australian. He talked definitely
enough of the State’s deficit ; but that is as
obtrusive as, and much less stationary than,
the Pyramid of Cheops would be in Hay-
street. As to squaring the ledger, or sloAv-
ing doAvn the financial slide, the policy
speech xvas a confession of helplessness. And
even the meagre measures of increased taxa-
tion Avere apparently capable of being ex-
plained away. Minister Thomas had a
different story to tell the cockies of his elec-
torate, xvho squealed at the proposed increase
of railway freights, xvhile Honorary Minister
and Country Party leader Willmott hotly
attacked the nexv regulations which his Gov
ernment had prepared xvith the object of
squeezing a little extra cash out of the tim-
ber industry. The only thing resembling
an issue before the electors xvas the financial
position, but the policy of the majority of
the candidates xvas merely that Something
Must be Done. That xvas as near as most
of the politicians got to it, and to that extent
the Government may claim to have a man-
date from the country—but xxdth various
reservations. Whether the members of the
present miscellany hang on to,the Govern-
ment benches or not there is, consequently,
little prospect of the State’s fearsome finan-
cial position being improved materially.
Treasurer Jimmy Gardiner is full of good
intentions; but whichever xvay he attempts
to mox’e he is xvarned off. It is -significant
that some of the most prominent anti-federal-
ists are noxv admitting gloomily that unifica-
tion is inevitable; and that soon.
♦
The Degradation of the Judiciary.
Partly in justification of xvliat this paper
had to say at the time about the manner in
Avhich the last-but-oue general strike of coal-
miners in N. S. Wales xvas “settled.” it takes
this from the report of a sitting of the
Federal Arbitration Court last xveek at Mel-
bourne to hear a matter connected with the
Coal and Shale Employees’ Federation :
Mr. Schrader: That strike lasted until December.
The Commonwealth then appointed Mr. Justice
Edmunds, of Nexv South AVales, a commissioner to
deal with the matter, and, as was now well known,
Mr. Justice Edmunds had instructions to concede
what the men demanded.
His Honor: I xvas asked by the Prime Minister to
act as commissioner under such instructions, but I
refused to do so.
Mr. Schrader : Anyone would anticipate that.
His Honor: It would have irretrievably injured the
prestige and influence of this court if I had not
refused. It xvas stated by Mr. Justice Edmunds
that he did not regard himself as an arbitrator ; he
xvas there to grant xvhat the men asked for. It was
a most baneful precedent.
To describe such a precedent as “baneful”
is to use the very mildest language. This
paper would have found it difficult to dis-
agree xvith Higgins if lie had described the
proceedings as the heaviest blow struck at
the Arbitration Court since it came into being
and a degradation of the judicial office. If
a judge can be told to grant one side what
it asked for he can be told to grant the other.
If a judge can be told xvhat he is to do he
is not a judge but a tool. And xvhen a Gov-
ernment gets the ear of a man who sits on
the Bench xvhether he temporarily calls him-
self a commissioner or anything else, it de-
grades the name of Justice. That “settle-
ment” xvas a fraud on the country, and
the strikes xvliich followed it in great pro-
fusion came as the natural consequences
thereof.
——
Australians in the Pacific.
Of vital interest to Australia are the
changes the Avar has made in the Pacific.
The Commonwealth has acquired possessions
by capture from Germany that during the
Avar must necessarily remain under military
authority; and though military necessity
demands silence on certain aspects of the
question, it is imperative that the Common-
wealth should formulate its Pacific policy
xvithout delay. In fact, the xvhole position
concerning British possessions in the Pacific
needs overhaul. Downing-street is too re-
mote to exercise control sympathetic to Aus-
tralian interests, or, for that matter, any
serious control at all. The Commonwealth
is A’ery directly concerned —much Australian
capital is employed in Island industries, and
The Bulletin is constantly receiving evi-
dence of the necessity of a larger authority
over the conditions under xvhich the Com-
monxvealth’s citizens labor in the Pacific.
Take Ocean Island as an instance. This
speck of phosphate, almost under the shadow
of the Equator, is practically under the con-
trol of the Pacific Phosphates Co., a London
company which pays tribute to the British
Government for the right to work the fer-
tiliser. Labor consists of Kanakas, who until
recently received up to 30s. a month, since
increased to £2 owing to the co.’s inability
to otherwise secure sufficient drafts, and
Japanese, who also receive up to £2 a month.
A xvhile ago a Melbourne doctor, coming into
the place, discovered that, instead of the
Kanaka receiving his natural vegetables,
the menu consisted of tinned fish, rice
and biscuits of uncertain age. As a
consequence of this diet there were 60
cases of scurvy amongst the Kanakas
during May. The medicines stocked were
found to be quite unsuitably bottled for
the climate ; the operating-table was out of
date; the surgical knives were in bad condi-
tion ; the tooth-extraction instruments were
obsolete and not well-kept; there were no
medical books; and surgical needles, splints
and a number of other necessities were want-
ing. At one time the matron of the hospital
was away for four months and no relief was
provided; during her absence one of the
whites fell ill with an acute attack of appen-
dicitis, and, besides operating, the doctor had
to do all the nursing for three critical days.
In the Kanaka hospital some of the fluid ex-
tracts have been in stock for seven years
and are of uncertain strength. So much for
hospital treatment. The senior members of
the white staff of the co. are allotted a mess
allowance of £6 a month, and the junior
staff £5 6s. Sd., the goods being purchased
from the co.’s store; yet the cost per head is
at least £B. These Ocean Island conditions in-
dicate that more supervision is necessary;
and control can be best exercised by an
officer responsible to an authority nearer
than Downing-street.
State Lotteries.
Waddell's suggestion in N. S. Wales Legis-
lative Council that Government sweeps
should be established to prevent the profits
of such concerns going into private hands
has about the same arguments as those in
favor of the totalisator to recommend it to
the public. While the investor probably gets
quite as good a deal from the existing con-
cern in the Speck as he would from an open
sweep run by the State, there is an atmo-
sphere of irregularity and underground
pleasure about a thing that is half legal and
half illegal which doesn’t exactly harden the
moral fibre. An experiment of many years
has proved the hopelessness of suppressing
this mild form of gambling.. When it Avas
removed from Sydney' to a remote corner of
the Commonwealth and proscribed by the
Postal authorities, it seemed to the rvild re-
forming person that the sweep Avas beaten
and must sloxvly fade aAvay and die under
such Avithering conditions. At present it
shoAvs no sign of losing any of its popu-
larity, and a little inconvenience seems to be
the worst the proprietors have to complain
of. This being so. there is no earthly reason
why the farce of its prohibition should con-
tinue ; and if the results of the experiment
are to be regarded as conclusive and the ban
taken off, Avhy not let the State collect the
profits? Moralists may draw a nice line
betAveen permitting vice to exist and being
a partner in it; but the vast majority of
citizens are very far from considering an in-
vestment in a SAveep as in any Avay xdcious.
Compare cash thus expended Avith cash put
into lots of other things Avhich the most
ardent churchman considers fair enough, and
the difference is only that of Tweedledum
and Taveeqledee. After all, it is the
majority sense that must decide whether cer-
tain things are Avrong or right in practice;
and a referendum of the Commonwealth
xvould certainly not condemn the SAveep.
The Follies of Humanity.
“0.K.” ; The war Avas only a month or two
old when I Avrote a satirical Plain English
on the episode of some British sailors being
shelled by German warships Avhile engaged
in the quixotic task of rescuing the creAV of
a sunken German vessel. Cries of horror at
Hun outrages on the more humane rules of
warfare were new and poignant in those
days. With a fair notion of Avhat was in
store for our side, I put i from the Hun
point of view, protesting that the avowed
business of Avar Avas destruction, and that
nothing could be more illogical than the
rescue of droAvning sailors by an enemy Avho
had just been endeavoring to bIoAV them all
to—he didn’t care Avhere. I argued not from
the heart, but from the head —where all logic
comes from. The British Avere fighting under
handicap conditions. They Avere as a man
Avho starts to play a clean game of cards
against a sharper aa t lio is allowed to do all
he knows. On land and sea they were nurs-
ing scruples and hugging the resolutions of
the blessed Hague Convention, the name
Avhereof Avas always Mud in Berlin. Since
then they liax-e dropped many of those
scruples, lest they should suffer the fate of
all honorable mugs, however cautious their
play, who are up against a conspiracy of
tricksters. But they and their Allies con-
tinue to plead for concessions to the Christi-
anity of the Red Cross. This clinging to the
last vestige of Respectability in Avarfare has
come to be pathetic under the circs. Listen
to Perry Robinson, of London Times :
In some units the proportion of casualties among'
the stretcher-bearers exceeds those of the infantry in
the firing-line. This is the result of deliberate
sniping. The Germans well know whom they are
shooting. Two flays ago three out of four members
of a stretcher-party were sniped at close range and
shot dead....
The sad truth is that the German soldiers and
people will never have the same conception of the
Red Cross as other nations. They regard it purely
as a military unit, like the artillery, and ridicule
our respect for it. As I write, German stretcher-
bearers are moving in full view of our men, while
German officers behind are laughing at our “folly.”
From the military point of view we have
nothing to gain and much to lose by continu-
ing not to regard the Red Cross as a military
unit; by not employing prisoners and enemy
civilians in dangerous Avar work near the
firing-line; by not raining bombs on non-
combatants in order to kill them as dead as
the passengers on the Lusitania, or the crew’s
of many another merchant vessel that the
Huns have destroyed—in short, by not resort-
ing to Frightfulness against a foeman xvho
makes Frightfulness his fundamental policy.
From a moral standpoint, it Avill be good in
us to have always respected the Red Cross—
if we win the war. Rut if Ave lose it, or
don’t win it enough to ensure the final annex-
ation of Hun naval bases in the Pacific, then
Avill Australia be doomed to Germanisation
in the not-distant future, and its sons Avill be
taught to despise their British forefathers
as humanitarian fools and hypocrites. To
think of the three stretcher-bearers, sniped
at close range, is to wonder whether advanced
Civilisation can afford to conduct any Avar-
fare on terms unfavorable to its chance of
victory. The business of Civilisation is to
break the German “vill to conquer,” and
make the peoples who are obsessed with the
swank of militarism heartily sick of their

Limited
old obsession. But the practice of mercy can
be of no assistance to the accomplishment of
this awful task if it merely excites the ridi-
cule of conquering vill-sters. To prove they
are not foolish in their ideals the Allies have
got to win this war and make every German
feel, when it is over, that his ideals have
dragged him into a beastly mess. Meanwhile
the Germans, as the Times man remarks, are
not as other nations, and the Peacock Gov-
ernment, which refuses to close German
Lutheran schools in Victoria, ought to be
made to look foolish at the November election.
The German Boot Again.
Whether in the long, laborious operations
up on the skyline the Italian had only been
getting where the enemy wanted him to be
may be left for consideration later. The
thing that immediately matters is the Ger-
man’s stroke at the appointed time, and the
evidence afforded by this incident as to his
condition. Italy has been struck a heavy
blow. At the moment of writing its full
weight had not been determined, but it was
certainly carrying the descendants of
Julius Caesar rapidly backwards and yield-
ing the associated Huns a heavy haul of
prisoners and booty. By the beginning of
the week the greater part of the advances
made since the opening of the war by the
Italian armies had been wiped out and a
wedge driven so deeply into the centre of
the defence as to make the position of
Cadorna’s forces one of dire peril. The
enemy had then got his foot on Italian soil,
and, though what was going to happen next
was out of sight, it seemed clear enough
that, unless the defence could be quickly
stiffened, a few strides would give the in-
vader command of a large slice of northern
Italy. Assistance was being rushed through
France to the scene of the calamity ; some
of the Italian troops were reported to have
turned tail; the advance of the enemy was
general along the whole front, and something
in the way of a political earthquake had
happened in Rome. The details of this wild
upheaval make all the inspired hot air about
the enfeebled enemy look very foolish. There
is no getting away from it that on all fronts
he is still fighting with dash, endurance and
skill, and that the job of winning the war
wears the aspect of being as tremendous as
ever it did. It is nearly time Australians pulled
the wool off their eyes and realised what the
meaning of it all is to them, not only regard-
ing their army but in reference to every
phase of national life. Hitherto they have
been content to put themselves into the
bands of the politicians; and the politicians
have told them that all was well. All was
not well. All is not well. We are in great
danger of having to accept a peace that will
for all practical purposes mean a German
victory to-day and a renewal of the conflict
to-morrow. It may not be in Australia’s
power to prevent that awful disaster; but
Australia must hold herself responsible for it
if she does not employ every pound of her
strength. England, Canada and Maoriland,
France, Belgium, Italy, Servia and the
United States —all have adopted univer-
sal service. We alone stand out. For
six months we have made no move
because W. M. Hughes promised not
to interfere with the verdict of a
referendum taken a year ago if only the elec-
tors would put him into power again. That
Australia should sit down quietly now
because one man made that bargain
for his own political benefit is unthinkable.
Steps must be taken to reverse the verdict
imposed upon all Australia practically by
one State. In the light of the peril caused
by the Russian collapse and the Italian
catastrophe, Australia must be given the
chance to speak again. It may be a question
then whether we should vote No or Yes. But
no democrat can refuse to the people the
right to speak.
The fact that Hughes is really ill has
revived the rumors of Cabinet reconstruc-
tion. Joe Cook and Forrest fiercely deny
their alleged ambition to find something soft
for a sick man to do, but there is no doubt
that they would feel freer if Hughes were
running the Empire in another hemisphere.
Neither has lost his desire for William’s
chair, but they flatter themselves if they
think that the job of finding a new Prime
Minister will be limited to a duel. There is
another candidate in rugged William Watt.
Watt’s able work as a Minister has vastly
improved his chances, and he is made the
more dangerous by his overwhelming youth
and political acumen. Further, bis position
is strengthened by a current notion that
another Victorian is due for a turn at the
helm. This quaint idea, which has all the
force of an unwritten law, also makes
Irvine eligible, and it is known that a
patient squad of his followers cherish the
hope of seeing their idol carried in on a
wave of Conscription sentiment. In the
matter of intellect and personal dignity
Irvine would be an ideal Prime Minister,
but his constitutional Toryism would pre-
vent him treading the sober path of diplo-
macy. On recent performances there is only
one man for the job, and that man is Watt.

“Padjud” explains:—
The introduction of the arc system of wireless
telegraphy in Australian waters would immediately
close the many dangerous gaps in the alleged “day-
light chain.” The chief advantage of the arc over
the many spark systems is that its range is not
reduced by daylight. In fact, as atmospheric dis-
turbance is at a minimum during the daylight
hours, the daylight range is almost invariably
greater than at night, when disturbances (Xs for
short) are at their maximum. For efficiency the
arc is an easy winner. At night a 5-k.w. arc is
able to send about as far as a 30-k.w. spark, and
twice to three times as far during daylight. It
was the effort to invent a receiver for the “continu-
ous” waves of the arc system that produced the
extremely delicate audion. The super-sensitiveness
of this detector is, in my opinion, the most remark-
able thing in wireless to-day. Recently I heard a
ship using lj-k.w. (about 2-h.p.) 3600 miles away.
That 2-h.p. spread itself over the whole of Africa
and the Indian Ocean. Tropic India and the far
south got their quota; and giant waves of it
advanced across the map of Australia. Think how
small a proportion of it reached one point 3600
miles away. But the audion caught it. No other
detector would have done it. It is the arc-audion
combination that makes the 10,000- and 11,000-mile
ranges of to-day possible.
Lately The Bulletin had from “Aussie”
an Inky Way par. describing how he had
“come across a chap painting a name on a
little white cross.” He continued: “Name
was Charlie Walters; used to be a tone
etcher on Sydney Sun.” It looked as though
the name the chap was painting was
Charlie Walters; actually that was the name
of the chap who was doing the painting.
So The Bulletin has much joy in resur-
recting the Sydney Sun tone-etcher, and
hopes that he won’t want a little white cross
himself till long after the Kaiser has got a
tombstone of brass.
The Bulletin doesn't know a better Aus-
tralian than George D. Meudell, and he has
sound ideas about finance and the power of
expressing them. Grenville has a chance of
electing him to the Vic. Parliament this
month ; and if it doesn’t give him the seat it
will be responsible for leaving out of Parlia-
ment a man who would supply the House
with some of the vigor and imagination that
it is very badly in need of.
Hennessy takes his deposition from the
Mayoralty of Melbourne as hard as the aver-
age politician takes separation from a port-
folio. When he surrendered the rabbitskin
he saw the vanishment of any hope he ever
had of writing Bart, on his luggage. '
The return of Pilkington and Draper,
K’s.C., for Perth and West Perth respec-
tively at the recent Westralian general elec-
tions, is evidence that the people are heartily
sick of the insects bred by machine politics.
Both were elected not because of their poli-
tical policies but because intellectually they
stood head and hip above their opponents.
“G. 1.” : There are still a few eligible men
in Victoria. Fourteen hundred members of
the Citizen Forces were in camp the other
week at Broadmeadows, and Captain Dyett,
the State recruiting-officer, came out to talk
to them. The youngest unit was composed of
18-year-olds, while listening to Dyett were
many hundreds of hefty fellows of 22 and 23.
Amid uproarious lack of enthusiasm two
recruits stepped forward; the others were
unmoved by the earnest remarks of the man
who had “been there.” That force of 1398
young men is a fearful reproach to the
“shackled” Government which climbed into
power as a war-winner, to remain there as
a passive opponent of the fair-thing and
genuine democracy. The Ministry, though
it spends much of its time getting the “last
shilling,” can’t possibly blind itself to the
fact that its “last man” is still leaning up
against the landscape in excessive numbers.
And most of him will remain there, in sub-
lime confidence. Didn’t the Win-the-War
Prime Minister promise them that they could
go on leaning up against the landscape if
they would allow him to go on leaning up
against his job?
The return of Major-Dr.-ex-Pi-ofessor
Cherry, A.A.M.C., from his latest parasite-
hunt, conducted in Westralia, has been
marked by the publication of his new
book, “The Will to Evolve.” The volume
deals with Pan-Germanism, Neo-Darwinism
and the relations between instinct and reason,
with special reference to the chimpanzee,
the Prussian and the blue-nosed baboon.
Native-born books of philosophy are so far
rare in this country, and Major Cherry’s
work will probably soon be found on all the
best book-shelves.
The first member of Parliament to be
caught in Maoriland’s military service net
was P. C. Webb, Labor member for Grey.
But it only happened in the final ballot for
single men. In 11 ballots, with a total of
75,974 men, his card was the last one
drawn.

Two months ago, when “Good Gracious,
Annabelle,” was happening in Sydney, The
Bulletin might have mentioned that the
quaint absurdity was conventionally Ameri-
can. The plot, and there’s a superabundance
of involved plot in the Marie Tempest piece
at Melbourne Boyal, is all about dollars. All
the persons concerned, most of whom don’t
matter, are looking for dollars all the time.
Dollars to pay for the luncheon of an assort-
ment of sassiety wasters and hangers-on at
a fashionable New York hotel. Dollars to be
earned as the wages of imposture by the
same people when they all engage themselves
as servants to a drunken millionaire who is
not expected to require their services. Dol-
lars due for shares in a Baby Mine the pos-
session whereof is wrapped in a mist of
alleged chicanery until the gilded inebriate
and the long-lost husband of Annabelle agree
to share it between them. A strange fantasy
of Dialogue and Dollars is “Good Gracious,
Annabelle.” The lady runs the complications
on lines that have hitherto been restricted to
male endeavor. Annabelle has the ready wit
and unfailing audacity of a bustling Niblo in
a patter part. But the substitution of a
woman for a man in the central position is
not the author’s only trick. He —or is Clare
Ivummer a she?—makes the long-lost husband
of Annabelle a purely melodramatic person,
who lived in a cave before he became a capi-
talist and shaved his hermitical beard. An
actor with a lighter touch than Frank
Harvey might make the ex-hermit seem less
theatrical, but not more true to the history
of the character. His weird past lias got to
be taken seriously, otherwise the bottom falls
out of the case of dollars, and all that is
human in the proceedings of the other princi-
pals becomes mere spoof and spinach. Har-
vey is the spirit of melodrama that blows
into the fashionable hotel, flits into the
second act and stares through the window
when the mock cook is picking the dipso-
maniac’s pocket, and concludes the fantasy
by taking her up in his arms.
The gaiety and address of Marie Tempest
go a long way towards lifting the entertain-
ment above the farcical-comedy level, and
the “drunk” of Graham Browne is an amus-
ing sketch. Mrs. George Lauri is moderately
droll as an unsober under-cook ; Sidney Stir-
ling makes a rather dull pretence of being
an incredibly gullible person ; Frank Harvey
has been previously apologised for, and the
rest of the cast is unfavorably situated for
cutting any ice. “Good Gracious, Anna-
belle,” is for a few nights only, three other
pieces being promised within the limit of a
brief season.

Ernest Langford, as a grotesque taxi-driver
is a welcome freak, especially as he starts a
mad refrain that runs like chicken-pox

Marie King Scott, the cleverness of the dia-
logue and the piquancy of the situation make
a success of “The Beauty Shop,” produced
at Sydney Tivoli on Saturday. This one-

for the beautifying of a sex that hitherto
we have believed to have been born that
way. Into this shop comes, in a last des-
perate effort to retain the love of her hus-
band, a forlorn little woman, whose goodness
of heart and not her complexion or her
figure is her chief asset. There, amid a
number of society women getting renovated
and Spring-cleaned, we see the skilful efforts
of the staff make a beauty out of a freak.
Spring-poets and men about to marry are
advised not to see this shocking strafing of
all masculine illusions. Marie King Scott’s
character-study is a revelation of stage-craft;
Marie Eaton is excellent also as a society
women; but Vera Pearce, though full of
vivacity, unfortunately retains her vaude-
ville habit of taking the centre of the stage
and addressing her confidential remarks to
the back of the gallery. Excellent method
for a principal boy, but out of keeping in
modern comedy.

At Sydney Royal this week “The Sons
of the Empire” are being paraded to help
the Repatriation Fund. Glimpses of Bill-
jinx in and around Bapaume are the most
interesting feature of the show, which also
includes excellent naval and aerial photo-
graphy. At Hoyt’s Marie Corelli’s “Tem-
poral Power” is being served up in six
strenuous acts, and Emmy Wehlen is the
heroine in “The Trail of the Shadow,” a
good example of Wild West drama. Two
Paramounts are showing at the Haymarket:
“The Happiness of Three Women.” with
Billy Craig as the lady-killer, and “The
House of Lies,” Edna Goodrich being the
perfect lady. George M. Cohan’s “Broad-
way Jones” and “Seven Keys to Baldpate”
are two now Paramounts, to be shown
shortly. At the Crystal Palace William
Desmond presumes to be “Master of His
Home” and strikes a snag or two; and at
the Lyceum \\ ilkie Collins’s “Woman in
White” leads an entertaining bill.
To-night (Thursday) the bill at Melbourne
Majesty’s will be changed to “Caste,” for the
particular purpose of displaying Cyril Maude
as Eccles, a disreputable parent of the old
bulldog breed. Everybody in Melbourne has
either seen “Caste” in the long ago or heard
of it in the meantime, and the last two
nights of Cyril Maude’s season should be
crowded occasions. On Saturday the Musi-
cal Comedy Co. comes along with “You're in
Love.” “Gran’dad Rudd” will stay on at
Melbourne King’s for Cup week, and then the
Bailey-Grant management will give Shaks-
peare a further opportunity to make good.
The new season of classic drama begins on
November 10 with our old friend “Hamlet,”
and lan Maclaren will be the ruminative

What the decorators and furnishers have

is to be revealed on Saturday, when the
theatre resumes business. William Anderson
has booked the house for the holiday time,
and will present a hardy annual entitled
“Robbery Under Arms.”

The festive spirit of the Strollers is break-

The blasphemy is quite as fine in its point
of satire as James’s jests at the expense of
Yankee conjurers and Dago opera-singers.
The same conspirator further scores in the
quaint fancy of “The Night Watchman,”
while he has developed his ventriloquial turn
to embrace an unladylike phantom who
breathes gin from a balcony. This female is
Desmond in a state of extreme disrepair.
Madeline Rossiter’s high kick still maintains
its dizzy altitude, and her dusky fingers
stray over the piano in soft and soothing
accompaniments to her own little ditties.
Connie Milne gets a few minutes of spot-
light, and basso Graystone continues to mur-
mur about his old friend Neptune a
young earthquake getting into training. The
new lady, Josie Jackson, is a valuable auxili-
ary, and can croon a lullaby that would put
a nap party to sleep. Cyril Northcote re-
appears as various Ivnuts, but none of them
have lost their unpleasantly feminine savor.
At Melbourne Tivoli the Follies and Mack
are breathing their last. Ada Reeve is re-
turning on Saturday, and in the presence of
artistic Ada even the advt. pales its ineffec-
tual fires and leaves the lady to do most of

old address near Princes Bridge, Melbourne.
The procession of marvels has been quickened
up since the opening night, and now affords
the small boy a more compact gloat lasting
without intervals for 2.\ hours. So far, there
have been no casualties in the show, though
a talkative clown threatens to develop lock-
jaw and an excitable Red Injun, apparently
ravenous for palefaces, is expected to burst
at any moment. Incidentally, real trouble
nearly happened the other night when one of
Bernasconi’s lions went out for a stroll and
started poking his nose into some promising
attachments in .he Alexandra Gardens. He
was apprehended later heading towards St.
Paul’s with the evident intention of tasting
a dean.
Hoyt’s (Melbourne) have Mabel Talia-
ferro this week as a fascinating female Tur-
pin in “Peggy, the Will o’ the Wisp.” Mabel
is an Irish heroine who robs the rich to feed
the poor, wherefore her knaveries are ap-
proved as a jehad against the ruling classes.
Marion Swayne shows up strongly in Hoyt’s
other art-drama, “The Road Between.” It is
the tale of country yokels who are enriched
by an invention and robbed by crooks,
but Marion is pretty and beguiling enough
to give pictorial consequence to the old, old
story.

The principal attraction at the Melba
Theatre, Melbourne, this week is George
Walsh in the Fox comedy entitled “The Book
Agent.” Walsh is a mixture of Hercules and
Apollo, with a dash of Charles Chaplin, and
in his various eccentric adventures he reveals
a capacity for sudden surprises. Bessie Bar-
riseale opened at the Britannia last Monday
for a three days’ run in “Borrowed Plumage.’’
To-day “The Maelstrom” starts whirling, with
Earle Williams and Dorothy Kelly in the
centre of the confusion.
This week’s Melbourne art show:—
John Rowell has joined the rush for fame and red
wafers at the Melbourne Athenseum. John invites
inattention by the quantity of his canvases, but a
patient investigator will find something to arrest his
fancy. The artist is at his happiest when he con-
centrates his vision on small, fleeting impressions
like the sallow afternoon behind “The House on the
Hill” or the shadowy nocturne called “The Grey
Barge.” This phase of Rowell’s work is a separate
metier requiring a separate soul and a daintier
talent, and so far it is the whole of his artistic
achievement. His larger pictures, dealing with the
inevitable gum-trees and blue skies, are cruder and
coarser, and make open confession of being the work
of one who has just emerged from the nursery at
the National Gallery.

A trial performance has been given in
Adelaide of a farce-comedy by a clever local
presswoman, Edith Aird. “Wanted a Baby”
is just what the title suggests, the story of
two people who advertise, and of course get
overwhelmed with strange infants. As the
chief advertiser is a bachelor, who lends his
name and his flat simply to oblige a casual
childless cousin, there are complications with
his own girl when the babies drop in. The
amusing trifle is spun out into four short
acts, which is one too many. The dialogue
is clever, but the acting was, for unknown
reasons, entirely in the hands of ladies, and
amateur writing needs the very best profes-
sional attention to give it its due chance.
Hall Caine’s solemn “Woman Thou Gavest
Me” is having a second week at Adelaide
Tivoli, which means solid success. The
Andersonian co. gives it full value, with Cos-
grove as a delightful priest and Ida Gresham
a female villain. The Gaelic Co. revived
with success the old “Trial by Jury,” with
its mixture of melody, plain buffoonery and
“laughter in court.” The Majestic is
strong on the athletic side, four Romans hav-
ing been added to the one Manchurian, and
the Lewins putting in some surprising dance
steps. The Scotney-White pair are again
singing at the Town Hall; the Pav. stars
Matheson Lang; at West’s the beautiful (and
also effective) Desmond reappears; and Won-
dergraph has a real heart-to-heart drama of
the film, “The Church and the Woman.”
AT POVERTY POINT.
“Private Boxer” : I think I about hit the
mark in offering the opinion that the late
Maggie Knight never gave a better all-round
characterisation—at all events, in late years
—than in Shaw’s “Man and Superman.”
Her “Mrs. Whitefield” was perfection, or
as near to it as we ever get. I don’t know,
however, that the actress was overburdened
with laudatory notices for her performance.
Such are generally reserved for the star, and
poor Maggie’s part was not the stellar one.
But she made it so for me.
“GRAZ'DAD RUDD," AT MELBOURNE
KING'S.
Daniel (all dressed up) and Amelia Banks
begin to make love.
“O.K.’s” recollections of the lady:—
Mv memory of Maggie Knight dates back to 1886,
when she played Nellie Denver in the first revival of
“Silver King’’ at Melbourne Royal. The old firm
of Williamson, Garner and Musgrove engaged her as
lead in a very strong combination of talent. After
the “Silver King” revival she played the heroine in
“Human Nature,” among other Drury Lane dramas
of the kind. The cast included Titheradge, G. W.
Anson, Phil Beck, Herbert Flemming, Greville, Jewett,
George Bryant, Harry Taylor, Bill Leake, Jenny Watt-
Tanner, Nellie Mortyne and Emma Chambers. Maggie
Knight was the Ophelia to Titheradge’s Hamlet, while
Billy Elton, just arrived in Australia, served as
Gravedigger. She once played the twin heroines in
“New Babylon” when Anson, Elton and Bland Holt
were associated in the cast. In the early ’9o’s she
married a business man and left the stage. Clarke
and Meynell brought her back to notice, and the
new generation accepted her as a recent arrival.
One of the first things she did for C. and M. was
Mrs. Hardcastle in “She Stoops to Conquer,” when
the old comedy was revived for Madge Mclntosh’s
sake. A while later Maggie Knight appeared with
Matheson Lang in “The Passing of the Third Floor
Back,” and she was Mrs. Whitefield in “Man and
Superman” when Julius Knight and co. revived it.
At one time or other she played all sorts of characters
in an admirable manner. Of all Australian actresses
who never went abroad to gain experience and im-
prove their salaries she was the most finished and
most effective. She had personality and grace of
style. She lacked nothing but ginger.
“Bad Bill”: Maggie Knight made three
trips to the altar. Her first adventure was
with one Ilarkness, but the knot was cut
short in the divorce court. The second try
was with the ex-Maoriland blacksmith-foot-
baller and fine performer of heavies with
Rignold, Harry Jewett. Him she disposed
of by the same route. Several years later
came the Henderson alliance, which lasted
to the end. Ilarkness left her a daughter
and she bore Jewett a son. The former, a
comely and accomplished girl, married well
abroad. Young Jewett, I believe, is in
khaki.
“Harrison O.”: With humbleness I re-
cently suggested that the worth-while Aus-
tralian play can mostly achieve production,
either on the commercial stage or with the
help of a repertory organisation. “Ancient
Prompter” (B. 11/10/T7) hit this conten-
tion to leg by inquiring, “How many local
plays have J. C. Williamson. J. and N.
Tait and the Fullers staged?” Well, the
Firm has tried Australian stuff of various
sorts, including pantomime (“Djin Djin'"
and “Matsa”), opera (“Tapu”) and drama
(Rev. Taylor’s “Parsifal”). So. far as
drama is concerned, the Taits are still young,
but the Fuilcrs have found room for the re-
cent “Ruuyip” panto. We have also had
Australian-made versions of “The Three
Musketeers,” “The Christian,” “Joseph and
His Brethren” and “The Sorrows of Satan.”
Again, Bailey and Grant do not confine
themselves to bush drama, as “Ancient
Prompter” suggests. Thus far their pro-
ductions have had bush settings, for the
simple reason that Australian dramatists,
like Australian poets and story-writers,
mostly turn to the Outback for inspiration ;
but they have on hand an Australian play
whose scenes are all laid in the city. Then
what about the “Seven Little Australians,”
Bernard Espinasse’s “The Master of Anger-
stroom,” Bedford’s “The Unseen Eye,”
Dyson’s “Fact’ry ’Ands,” Alf Lumsden’s
“Bill Adams,” Mularkey’s “For Homestead
and Honor,” Spencer’s “Mrs. McSweeney”
and others? To “Ancient Prompter’s” other
question: “In which Australian city can
Australian authors hope for a production
by a repertory nowadays?” I reply that
Gregan McMahon, of Melbourne, has staged
plays by Louis Esson (8), Arthur Adams,
Edward Dyson, Alfred Buchanan (2),
Blamire Young, Billy Moore, May Wilkinson
and E. 11. Oliphant (2). The plain fact
is that most of the front-rank Australian
writers who have tried their hands at play-
making—Rudd, Adams, Esson. Dyson.
Bedford —and some others who are nowhere
near the front rank, have managed to
achieve production.
“Melb”: Coppin was the first to act
Teazle in Melbourne. He was then 26 years
old. Rogers was the best Australian in the
part; but Lambert outshone him as Sir
Anthony Absolute. Other good Teazles were
Brough, Cathcart, Forbes and Rankin, and
now we have Wilkie.
“75”: When Cyril Maude produces
“Caste” in Melbourne it will be played in
the costumes which were fashionable at the
time of its original London production in
1867. Previous Australian productions of
the comedy have been costumed in the mode
of the moment.
“Trot” : Whether it was the cost of living
or the memory of the last cray that was
operating is not explained, but someone on
the Sydney Telegraph seems to have turned
to the job of writing what he thought about
the new musical comedy, “Mr. Manhattan.”
with yearnings in his innards. It transpired
next morning that Mr. M. is a “joyous tit-
bit” and is “chockful of trifles sandwiched
between slices of chatter.” Also it is “a
light musical luncheon made up of delect-
able titbits, served artistically and washed
down with the lightest of sparkling efferves-
cents.” Furthermore, it is an “airy morsel”
and is “crisp and clean.” In the absence
of the Australian play, even Arthur Adams
should see reason for rejoicing at the develop-
ment of dramatic criticism along original
lines. It lends itself, moreover, to illimit-
able variation. For instance, with a little
imagination the next drama could be
described as a “weird mixture of tripe and
onions, flavored with cayenne, washed down
with pots of flat beer at 3d. a pint.” But
when it comes to the point of having to
describe the visiting star from Chicago as
“a young lady who plays the heroine with
the tense subtlety of a cook examining cut-
lets on the griller,” I fear me that courage
will fail and the new language of artistic
expression perish at the pencil’s point.
lan McLaren, who produces “Hamlet”
presently, will have Margaret Sutcliffe as
Ophelia. He will use a new arrangement of
Act 1, devised by Jimmy Athol wood, the-
action taking place entirely on the ram-
parts of the Castle of Elsinore. It is said
to be most artistic and useful to the con-
tinuity of the act, and it has the approval of
Harry Irving, no less.
“Norbell” :. Eardley Turner’s verse, “The
Resourceful Heavy” (B. 11/10/T7), reminds
me. When Rignold was doing “In the
Ranks” at the Opera House, Melbourne, an
armed I.W.W. character had to hide in a
copse with a view of making a kill of a
hated capitalist who was due to pass that
way. One night the quarry appeared punc-
tually and proceeded to cross the stage.
The concealed desperado clicked and clicked,
but his lethal weapon refused to bang. The
critical situation was neatly saved by his
victim, who staggered and fell C, exclaiming:
“Merciful Heaven! lam shot by an air-
gun !”
“Cyril Surcingle”: For the decency of
our country I want to know why the Cen-
sorship hasn’t used its double-headed axe
on a picture called “The Jaguar’s Claws,”
which is being shown in Melbourne. The
“Jaguar,” a Mexican bandit, seeing the wed-
ding of a pretty girl, orders his men to
capture her He then carries her to a
room. I can stop there. What lias the
Censorship Board got to say for itself?

FAMINE VICTIMS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“America is threatened with a cigar famine as a
result of war conditions. It is predicted that in a
short time the United States will not have one-third
of the cigars they need for their own consumption.”
You ask the doleful consequence—
What wiH this famine mean?
Sirs, when its ravages commence
The}’ will reduce to impotence
The villains of the screen 1
The Yankee picture industry
Is ruined from that day.
Without cigars I cannot see
The New York cop prowl fearfully
And pounce upon his prey.
Without cigars that thing of shame,
The wicked Wall-street guy,
Who seeks to land the lovely dame
By ruining her broker flame,
Must pine away and die.
The toughs who lurk behind the bars,
The wicked railroad cheat,
And scores of other picture stars
Must pass away. Without cigars
What will they have to eat?

“The Oldest Inhabitant”: The old ceme-
tery in Melbourne is again threatened with
annihilation by law. Even now the grave-
yard, with its historic monument to John
Batman, is only part of the original. In
1577 the market for meat in Victoria-street
was built on a site which encroached upon
the old ground. When the subject of the
market was first mooted an outcry was
raised against the proposal. Inquiry, how-
ever, showed that the corner to be taken for
market purposes, though within the ceme-
tery fence, had never been “consecrated.”
but had been used for the interment of such
deceased persons as were deemed unfit to
lie in holy ground. Executed malefactors
A QUESTION OF GENDER.
MR. JONES: “See Mrs. Myers over there? She's very prosperous of late.”
M R. SMITH: “ Yes! Made her money out of flats.”
MR. JONES : “Ah! Which sort?”
and persons who had suicided were interred
there. Though the ground was not “sacred”
it was considered only decent to remove the
remains and re-inter them elsewhere. The
oldest undertaker in Melbourne, John
Jennings, got the job, and he probably knew
more about what there was to do than any-
one else. There were supposed to be 20
bodies in the portion, but 28 were found,
sometimes five in one hole, sometimes three.
They were got about three and a half feet
from the surface. In one place were the
skeletons of three aboriginals who had been
executed in Melbourne in 1842 for murder.
Several of the bodies had been buried in
their boots, others in their belts, of which
the brass clasps and portions of the leather
remained. In one spot there was found,
along with a few bones, the remains of an
expensive coffin. This deposit was supposed
to indicate the grave of a well-off woman
who was found dead under circumstances
which indicated that she had suicided. Some
coins were discovered among one lot of
bones, as if they had escaped from a pocket
that had long before mouldered away. The
remains of the 28—all but the unknowns —
were interred in the Melbourne General
Cemetery. Twenty-seven persons, by the
way, were executed in Victoria between
January, 1842. and December. 1853, all
males of from 18 to 57 years of age.

“Yarra Borderer” : I don’t know who was
the first Australian to enlist for service in
this war; but I reckon our battalion is
worth mentioning. On August 1, 1914, in
the midst of our usual Saturday afternoon
parade, news arrived that war had broken
out with Germany. Immediately a call was
made to those prepared to enlist, and every
officer present and about 850 of the N.C.O.’s
and men at once said “Here!” The same
day our offering was communicated by our
0.0., Colonel Crouch, to headquarters, and
was published in the Melbourne papers on
August 3, the day before the war broke out
officially. The corps not only holds this
record, but it has sent 53 officers and 528
men to the Front, which, considering that
the bulk of its members are under 21, and
therefore subject to parental consent, will
be pretty hard to beat in the Commonwealth.
* * * *
“Chevron”: Clarence Brown, who quitted
the piano keyboard to take a seat in the
artillery orchestra, has been killed in
France. He was one of an aviary of eight
musical birds who shared a tent at the
gunners’ training-camp at Maribyrnong
nearly three years ago. These lads bought
second-hand and took to the Front, by many
a subterfuge, a busker’s harmonium. “The
old org.” went wherever a gun-wheel could
go. Once, during a sing-song, a shell
finished one of Brown’s chords with a crash,
and killed at his side a Billjim who was
half-way through “Australia Will Be There.”
Labelled “Q.M.’s Stores.” the organ was
stowed away at Port Melbourne, and per-
formed its successive stages on the way to
two Fronts—Gallipoli and France —vari-
ously disguised as “Officers' Kits” and
“Bully Beef.” Often reported missing, it
always rejoined its unit, and its strains
were strengthened by .those of a battered old
cornet blown by Reg Mason, a Corowa lad.
Once some of the birds even asked permis-
sion to take it into clink with them. Unless
Jack Johnson strafes it, it will come back
when the boys return
Tramping a steady tramp, like soldiers that march
to the beat
Of music that, seems, a part of themselves, to rise
and fall with their feet,
But Clarrie Brown won't sit in front of it
any more. That troubadour has gone beyond
reveille or return.

A CLASSICAL MASTER’S LETTER to CLEMENTS TONIC
Mr G A. Lundie, M.A., formerly Assistant-Headmaster High School, Palmerston North, N.Z, writes of this Medicine
And recommends it to all professional people, especi
ally to teachers in the Educational service of Aus-
tralia, who suffer from weak nerves, insomnia or
brain fag.

“G. A. LTJNDIE, M.A.”
There are hundreds of teachers of both sexes employed in
the N.S.W. Educational Service to-day who suffer from weak
nerves or acute nervousness, through continuous nerve strain in
teaching and study, who never really enjoy good health. It is
as much the worry of keeping their schools up to the educa-
tional standard as the work which accounts for their feeling of
general ill-health. They should keep Clements Tonic on hand
as a “stand-by” medicine, feeling certain that in its possession
they will have a sweet soother of the nerves, a promoter of
keen appetite, and a general healer of the rundown and over-
wrought system. It makes weak people well and strong people
stronger. Get it to-day.

“Boyd Cable” on the importance of air-
craft : —•
Those who say that “the art of flying is yet in
its infancy,” and argue from that false basis that
Australia ought not to start ’plane-building, ought
to be taken to the top of the Post Office tower and
offered the choice of reaching the ground per jump
or pei' plane.
The world hasn’t been kept as fully informed of
the progress made in flying as it used to be in
peace times, although the accounts of the long-
distance raids carried out by huge flying fleets might
well have set the stick-in-the-muds pondering. But
I don’t think it will over-agitate the Censor if I
remark that flying has progressed a bit in the past
six or seven months, and that airmen have made
regular flights in weather and wind and under condi-
tions that would have been thought impossible before
the war. Accidents —except the sort connected with an
anti-aircraft gun—-are almost unknown. (I say “un-
known” and not “unheard of’ because there is a
marked difference when the terms relate to war
events.)
If Australia realised the importance of ’planes in
earth-squabbles and the part they play in the game,
it would be afraid to sleep in bed o’ nights without
a tame ’plane tethered in the back paddock. The
movement of troops and transport in daylight is
now practically wiped out. No considerable bodies
of men or guns or tucker-carts or ammunition-wag-
gons dare move about within miles of the firing-line
where the big guns can reach, because the airman
has only to indicate the spot they occupy' on a
squared and numbered map for the guns to get busy
blotting out the movers. I may add that it hampers
field operations a whole lot not to be able to take
men and transport around as required, and if one
side could so move because the other side hadn’t
’planes to spot it and counter move and direct
artillery fire, there would be only one party, really,
in that war.
One of the most noticeable features of this present
unpleasantness is the attention that has to be paid
to circumventing the ’plane. As a gunner in the
war’s earliest days I can speak feelingly of how the
guns had even then to hide their heads from the tinv
speck that floats a long way up out of range. We might
be in the middle of a most useful bit of work, range
piped off to a yard, shrapnel timed and bursting
THE HONEYMOON.
THE GROOM: “Why so sad,
sweetheart?"
THE BRIDE: “I teas just thinking how miser-
able I'd he, Jack, if I had never met
you."
beautifully, a delighted artillery observing-offieer up
in the trenches shrieking down the ’phone to the
battery: “You’re right on ’em! Gun-fire please-
hard as you can!” In fact, everything might be .just
all lovely, when—“Whew-ew-ew” screamed the look-
out’s whistle to signal an enemy’s ’plane in sight.
Instantly every man dived to cover and vanished
into his burrow or wrapped himself up in a goose-
berry bush or crawled up a drain-pipe or otherwise
obliterated himself from air-view. The guns, of
course, were already carefully concealed before they
started to sling lead. So we sat dumb while our
beautiful Bosehe target went about its business and
removed itself from range or went to earth in the
trenches. You sec, although the Field Artillery is
willing to take on anything its own weight and a
bit over, it quite realises that it’s due to be counted
out in the next round if the big siege-guns locate
it per flashes visible to airmen. Australia may
therefore imagine the result if the enemy has plenty
of ’planes to practically shut up the shop of the
Australian batteries while Australia hasn t anything
to chase the enemy ’planes off the airscape and
prowl round the enemy positions.
So I say unto Australia: “Get busy ! Build ’planes !
Don’t buy ’em —build ’em ; because by so doing
you’re also building the men to fly them.”
’’Cherokee” : As grim as the tragedy itself
sequel to the ease at Bayswater
(\ ic.). where Frederick Silk, a grey old
farmer, having quarrelled with his wife be-
cause she persisted in “setting” hens, put
two bullets into her without fatal effect and
then shot himself dead. The onlv son of the
aged couple, Private Frederick j. Silk, was
in Franco, and local gossips reckoned it
would be a shock to the lad when he heard
the news from home. They need not have
worried —news has come through that he
was killed ou September 20. a little more
than three weeks before his father pulled
the trigger. It is on the women of the
v that the tragedy casts the heaviest
shadow, for Private Silk's mother is still' in
hospital, and he leaves a wife and a baby.
He was just 26, and an only son.

The other day, at Stoekinbingal (X.S.W.I,
a lad of 17 was bitten on the leg by a snake.
Not having a knife, he chewed out a lump
of flesh around the wound, sucked out the
poison, made a ligature with his sock and
a stick and walked home. From there
he was rushed to the hospital, and no
further harm w r as done. When asked by
the doctor how he came to think of biting
out the lump of meat he replied: “I
reckon it’s enough to make a bloke think

South Aus. is going to give up the
word “compulsory” as applied to vaccina-
tion. Since the operation may be
avoided on a declaration of objec-
tion by the parents, the objectors
have far outnumbered the willing ;
so a short Act now abolishes the
pretence of compulsion —with
power to the Health authorities
to go suddenly back to the old idea
by proclamation in case of an un-
expected epidemic. To tell the
truth the modern expert in public
health doesn’t attach very great
importance to infantile vaccina-
tion. He is quite willing to give that up
in return for authority to deal with entire
blocks of the population, adult and other-
vise, on the outbreak of disease.

his statue stands in the middle of King

as saving “Let it be there.” The cottage
where' he died soon after he had finished the
Adelaide job is falling into decay, and is
used as a storeroom and stables, with an
early prospect of making way for a factoi.v.

A Director of Raffles should find plenty of
work in keeping promoters on the straight
and narrow path. The city fairly swarms
with these patriots, great and small, and
some of their capers are extraordinary, to
say the best of them. The unlimited raffle
with the indefinitely-postponed drawing-
date is as common as siugs in strawberry-
time. The “winner"
who can’t be found,
while the diamond-
ring remains in abey-
ance on the pro-
moteress’s finger, ex-
ists in legions. Draw-
ings take place in
all manner of dark
corners and secret
places. And when it
comes to “expenses,"
there are some pretty
dear old ducks wad-
dling around with
books of tickets, the
“net proceeds” of
which are designed
for some noble
national need. Among
the disagreeable per-
sons associated with these
sharps and climbers are the
frock-coated touts from the
jewellery stores, who haunt
committee meetings with their
boxes of flash tiaras and rain-
bowy necklaces, offering them
at “cost price” to be.raffled for
the good of the cause. But the
most striking case of wliat’sit-
called was the dame who, after promoting u
raffle for a £lOO prize, had the misfortune to
have the article won by her bouncing
daughter.
An Act for giving fresh names to the Ger-
man-christened places in South Aus. is
going through the State Parliament. The
suggestions of the committee (B. M. Smith,
Rodney Cockburn and H. C. Talbot) originally
appointed will be mostly accepted. The last
Government insisted on native names, but
the committee did not agree and will gen-
erally have its own way. For example, it
suggests Mount Kitchener for the Kaiser-
stuhl hill. The well-known township Hahn-
dorf is hovering between “Yantaringa” and
“Birdwood,” • which last some people think
might get confused with Birdsville (Q.).
The opportunity is to be taken to alter some
names quite British which have got dupli-
cated. Sedan may also go into the melting-
pot; it is not German at all. but was named
by local people of German extraction to cele-
brate the French surrender in IS7O.
From Petrograd :
The trial of ex-War Minister Sukhomlinoff revealed
the latter's connection with Colonel Miasoyedoff, who
was hanged for his treachery a few months back.
Miasoyedoff was one of the most amazing characters
in Russia. His life was a melodrama with Grand
Guignol trimmings. He had been intimate with
Berlin -for several years, and as far back as 1912
Gutchkoff, who had a fine nose for traitors, dis-
covered the Colonel’s crime and roared him into
retirement, after the pair had exchanged smoke in
a bloodless duel. This little affair should have
ended in a funeral; but Gutchkoff, a dead shot,
said that he was going to save the warrior for the
rope. When war broke out —largely, it is said,
through Miasoyedoff advising the Kaiser of Ivan’s
unreadiness —the wonderful Colonel was back in
the Army and sending tips to Berlin, with Sukhom-
linoff guarding him against interruption. But the
debacle of Tannenberg finished the schemer. A
Russian lieutenant, taken prisoner by the Germans,
effectively pretended German sympathies, temporarily
joined the Hun Secret Service and heard all about
Miasoyedoff’s complicity in the disaster. The lieuten-
ant sent his story through the Bear’s representative
in Stockholm, and when it was found true in every
particular the Colonel was trapped and hurriedly
strangled. Oddly enough, Miasoyedoff became
friendly with Sukhomlinoff through the latter’s
second missus, a pretty young Jewess from Kieff,
who had married the old boy after she had bribed
the Church to part her from her first hubby, an
obscure schoolmaster. This woman was a prize
intriguante, with a number of suspicious Austrian
and German friendships and a talent for smuggling
ON A DRY TRACK.

valuables over the frontier. She was a frequent
traveller over the big trunk line that crosses the
border at Wirballen, where the late Minsoyedoff,
of the Guard, gave her his best assistance. Probably
she was responsible for Suk.’s downfall. Before she
met him he was widely regarded as a competent and
trustworthy soldier, and even to-day his enemies
admit his great ability.

Now that Rose has left me.
Am I free of care?
Has she grown less dear
Than when she was near,
Does she seem less fair?
Nay, in truth, I trow not;
Though I'm off with Rose,
Rose is sweeter now,
fairer, too, I vow,
Than when she was close.
Rose, an amber cluster,
Hangs upon the vine
Just a shade too high,
And I leap and sigh:
“Ah, that she was mine 1”
Though the fox gainsay it,
Failing in his hour,
This I fain would teach:

Are not always sour.’’

figures that ever adorned the Australian
bench. Robert, just dead, took his degree
from Trinity and practised for over 20 years
in Warrnambool and Penshurst (Vie.) as
barrister and solicitor —in Equity, for choice.
He was a keen scholar and a keen sport.

Tom Walsh, once of some prominence as secretary
to the N. S. Wales Seamen’s Union, has submerged
his identity for ever by becoming husband to suffra-
gette Adela Pankhurst. During the coal-strike of
1909-10 Tom, then a Newcastle resident, attracted
attention by reason of his emotional outbreaks. One
day would find him howling for the scalp of Premier
Wade and other tyrannous oppressors, and the next
day he would be preaching brotherly-love and the
gospel of lawn*
order. At one
strike meeting he
yelled: “A way

him! Hang him 1”

for a permanent holiday at 70, passed by
N. S. Wales Assembly, brings the President
of the Arbitration Court (Heydon) and two
District Court Judges (Docker and Fitz-
hardinge) to where they hang up their wigs.
Of these the most ancient is Docker —75.
None of the Supreme Court Judges are
directly affected, but the measure leaves Sly
to struggle with precedent for only three
years longer, and will bring rest to Bring

Joe Summers, Doctor of Music, died at
Perth the other day. He was 82 when he
went out—a mighty fine innings considering
that he used to hit out freely during his
many years in Melbourne. Joe came to Mel-
bourne from England in the late ’so’s, or
early ’6o’s, at the invitation of his gifted
brother Charles, the sculptor. Talent ran
in the family. Joseph had possibilities as a
musician which he never realised, but he did
at least get the degree of Mus. Doc. from the
Archbishop of Canterbury (of all people!)
when he visited London for the last time in
the long ago.

Verran, eldest son of old ex-Premier John

turned to the old home to die.

avenue was laid out, the two trees that bear
their names were planted side by side. And
now comes news that both boys were killed

“The Oldest Inhabitant’s” send-off :—-
After living for 82 years at Locksley, George-
street, Parramatta, the house in which he was born,
Charles James Byrnes was carried out last week. He
was son of James Byrnes, who with his brother
William had woollen mills on the riverside of
Parramatta in the building known in Parson Mars-
den’s time as “The Factory.” 'William Byrnes sat in
the first, or five-year, Leg. Council, from 1858 to
1861, and in the “life” Chamber from that year
until his death in 1891. James Byrnes sat in the
first Leg. Ass. for Central Cumberland. In the
second, third and fourth Parliaments he was elected
for Parramatta, but before being sworn in for the
fourth resigned, as he was to be one of the 20 with
whom it was intended to swamp the “other Cham-
ber” in order to pass the Robertson Land Bill
(1861). That scheme having fallen through, James
Bvrnes awaited the next general election and held a
seat in the fifth and sixth Parliaments for the old
borough. Then he took a Government billet as
land-valuer. With the retirement of James Byrnes
from Parliament came into existence the Hugh
Taylor-Byrnes factions which kept Parramatta alive
for many years. Hugh Taylor succeeded James
Byrnes, and sat in the seventh to fifteenth Parlia-
ments, excepting the tenth. In one Parliament he
had C. J. Byrnes for colleague. But it was in the
municipal council that the factions shone brightest.
C. J. Byrnes was intended for the law, and served
articles with an old-time solicitor, Hamilton Walsh,
of Goulburn. He did not apply for admission, how-
ever, but went into trade, and had woollen mills in
Granville and Parramatta. Then he turned to coal,
and had large interests in southern collieries, and
was chairman of B. Byrnes, Ltd., though between
him and Barney Byrnes, the founder, there was no
family connection. The original Byrnes is under-
stood to have been a soldier, who settled at Parra-
matta as a storekeeper when he got his discharge.
Gunner J. W. Shaw, lately killed in
action, was one of the promising young men
of the N.S.W. Agricultural Department.
Trained at Hawkesbury, he was passed on
to the teaching staff there, but was soon
transferred to Bathurst as experimentalist.
Though only 26 at the end he had been for
some time an inspector in his department,
and his loss to the industry in N. S. Wales
is hard to estimate. Dad is an old country
pressman—he used to edit the Mudgee Host.
Captain Herbert E. Greenstreet, who has
just retired from the New Zealand S. S.
Co.’s service, holds the world’s record as a
sea traveller. He has made 92 voyages
round the world, from England to Maoriland
and back, and with that and other knocking
up and down the oceans, has run-off over
2,500,000 miles. He has crossed the Equa-
tor 192 times and been 95 times round the
Cape of Good Hope. In 1881 he commanded
the barque Mataura, one of the first vessels
to be fitted with refrigerating appliances,
which carried 4000 carcases of frozen mut-
ton from M.L.; and since 1885 he has com-
manded steamers for the N.Z.S.S. Co.
Of his 66 years 51 have been spent at sea,
and he has never had a serious accident or
lost a day off duty.
Lieut.-Col. Pye, killed in France last
month, was one of the youngest graduates
that ever came out of the Sydney Medical
School. He wasn’t 21 at the time; and he
was only 28 when he died. Pye, who had
been in that other good school, the University
Scouts, left as\ captain, and as major soon
after landing on Gallipoli found himself
presently O.C. at Quinn’s Post; and later
experiences included a D.S.O. and the usual
wounds. He came from Windsor (N.S.W.),
and his name stands well up on the crowded
honor-board of Barker College at Hornsby.
Parker Moloney, ex-M.11.R. for Indi, who
has been offered the well-paid job of organ-
ising secretary to the Vic. Licensed Victual-
lers’ Ass., has decided that his principles
won’t let him. Moloney would sooner be
an M.H.R., and there will be opportunities
long before he grows grey whiskers and has
to wear elastic-sides for his poor feet.
THE DRESS DESIGNER
HE: “Hay what you like, it's very difficult for
a man to know how to dress nowa-
days."
SHE: “ Oh , no! You're always well-dressed
if you're in khaki. Especially big men.
It's so masculine.”

Hardshell preacher. Charles Iladdon .Spur-
geon, is dead, at 01. He very nearly was

land. There, in 1888, lie married Lita
McLeod, eldest daughter of Gideon Ruther-
ford. of Dunedin. Afterwards he went to
the Tabernacle in London, made famous by
his father. Compromising on the matter of
art, he wrote poetry.
Lieut. Teasdale Boake Smith, killed in
action lately, was a nephew of late Austra-
lian poet Barcroft Henry Boake, the strange
genius who wrote “Out Where the Dead Men
Lie.”
A. .T. Hampson, who was talked out of the
Bendigo seat in the Heps, by Hughes atithe
last election, has succeeded in enlisting, and
will be a second corporal in the Railway
Unit.
“Billy Blue”: lie Jokook’s discovery on
Trafalgar Day at Rockdale, Sydney,of a great-
grand-nephew of Nelson. The Ma State has
had many of the great sailor’s relatives. The
Pitt family, his second cousins, arrived in
1801 in the ship Canada, and their descend-
ants are spread throughout the land. Nel-
son's nearest kinsman to come to Australia
was Charles Horatio Nelson Matcham, who
was a son of the Admiral’s sister Catherine.
She married George Matcham of Sussex.
C. H. N. Matcham arrived in Sydney in 1821)
with the usual order —to receive “grants.”
lie first was handed 25G0 acres at Terrigal,
six miles from Gosford, and the small post-
town of Matcham at that spot perpetuates
his name. Matcham went in for squatting
in the ’3o’s, and took up Bogolong station
eight miles from Yass. He died there on
March 11, 1844, aged 39, without issue.
When old Saul Samuel, the first baronet,
died in 1900, the son was at Darlinghurst
(N.S.W.) Sessions Court on a jury which
had to be locked up for two nights. So for
48 hours he was a baronet and did not know
it. He is now on the London Stock Ex
change.
The late George Willcox, of Adelaide, left
£175,000, all made out of hides and their
by-products.

Queensland Government Savings Bank.
—The Ryan Government certainly docs
things. There used to be the State Savings
Bank and an Agricultural Bank, managed
by separate lots of trustees; and, of recent
years, a Workers’ Dwellings Board. The
Government has put them all under a Com-
missioner, appointed under an Act passed
last year, and in him all money deposited
in the bank and all debentures, Treasury
bills and other securities held, by the bank
are vested. Apparently there has been
loose talk that the politicians’ lingers can
get to the money; wherefore the Commis-
sioner in his first report has judged it advis-
able to say:—
By this time it should be widely known that the
Savings Bank is a wholly independent institution,
controlled solely, absolutely and permanently by a
Commissioner. . . .Not one penny of the depositors’
money or even one of the bank's securities can be or
has been drawn or touched without my express
authority.
All that the Government does is (1) to pro-
vide an Auditor-General to overhaul the
accounts and generally be a check upon the
Commissioner and (2) to guarantee the de-
posits.
Though there are three departments only
a general Profit and Loss account is pub-
lished ; and this shows a surplus of £31,924
for the year. The figures may be grouped
this way:—
Revenue. —
Interest (Savings Bank) . . £400,556

Profit for year .. .. • £31,924
The funds of the Agricultural Bank and
Workers’ Dwelling Board were supplied by
the Treasury at a ridiculously inadequate
rate, considering the cost of loans in recent
years. Under Section 12 of the Savings
Bank Act the Treasury was relieved of the
financing of these departments, and appar-
ently the £2,674,829 put into these mortgage
agencies by the Treasury was repaid on Jan.
1 this year out of the uninvested balance
of deposits in the Savings Bank —a nice
windfall for the Treasury, though, since the
State guarantees all the Savings Bank de-
posits, the transaction doesn’t really con-
cern the depositors very much. And it
didn’t drain the bank white by any means.
This Bank and the Savings Bank of S. Aus.
are much alike in size ; and this is how the
investment of their funds compares :• —
S. Aus. Queensland.

The Queensland mortgages are wholly
under the advances to settlers and workers’
dwellings schemes. Apparently until the
estami'sliment of this bank the Savings Bank
lent nothing on mortgage: everything that
was available the Government borrowed. Oh
bank deposit and in cash the S. Aus. bank
has 11.4 p.er of all its funds, aud there is
1.4 p.c. of interest accrued. The Queens-
land bank has on deposit and in cash 6.6
p.c., and in more or less liquid sundries only
0.3 p.c. It wouldn’t do any harm, if
the cash and deposit-at-call money was
a bit larger. True, there is £1,500,000
besides with the Treasury at call. But that
isn’t really to be distinguished from the
ordinary loans to the Treasury. On account
of the State guarantee the whole lot is on
call, if it conies to that.
The profits which the Commonwealth
Bank is making will presently set a lot pf
people thinking. And some of them will
come to the conclusion that the future of
Australian private banks isn’t what it was
before the other institution started. It
isn’t only that the Commonwealth Bank,
like this State concern, has no shareholders
to feed. A very important factor —perhaps
more important —is the vast quantity of
very cheap money at disposal. This_ com-
paratively small State bank has £12.574.813
of deposits: the big private Q.N.’s deposits
and other liabilities, apart from inscribed
stock, are under £7,500,000. Theoretically,
no doubt, a large proportion of these Sav-
ings Bank deposits must be kept in hand,
because they are payable at call. But in
practice the men who control these savings
banks know that they really need to have
less coin, bullion and banknotes in hand
than an ordinary bank, taking money on cur-
rent account and deposit. The figures
printed above prove it. For 20 years, at
any rate, there never has been a year in
Queensland when the new deposits haven’t
more than paid out the withdrawals; and in
S. Australia there has been only one instance
in the past quarter-century when it has
been otherwise. 80 it comes to . this : those
who handle the ’people's savings begin to
learn that they have a very big amount of
money, better by far than an ordinary fixed
deposit, which they get for 3 p.c. as a rule:
at present this bank is paying 34 p.c.
Hitherto, as with this bank, the tendency
has been to allow the always-ravenous State
Government to collar practically the lot.
But Denison Miller, pf the Commonwealth
Bank, has whetted the appetites not only
of State Savings Banks’ Commissioners, but
of private borrowers, who see that they
ought to be able to get the use of this money
at 1 p.c. or so cheaper than the average
private bank can afford to lend at. It
seems highly probable that this is going to
have pretty serious consequences for pri-
vate banks, unless they can think up some
way of getting cheaper deposits, too.
Neither the old Agricultural Bank nor
the Workers’ Dwellings Board was on a
satisfactory basis. The usual old thing had
happened : to make things easy and attrac-
tive business principles had been thrown
overboard. Presumably the Commissioner
will shut down on all that. In the Ad-
vances to Settlers Department there were
63 properties in possession at June 30.
Actually 49 fell in during the year. Mat-
ters are no better in the Workers’ Dwellings
section and may be worse. Up to June 30
no less than 113 houses had been thrown on
the hands of the mortgagee since the office
started in 1910. True, there has been prac-
tically no loss so far: but that, has been
on account of the rising market for most
things. It is a very good thing for the State
that a sterner administration was intro-
duced when it was. Repayments will have
reduced the amount advanced on the older
securities to reasonable proportions by the
time the slump becomes too definite. Cer-
tainly the borrowers may be expected to
bustle hard to keep up payments, seeing that
they are getting this money at 5 p.c. Lots
of people outside Queensland wish they had
a nice uncle like that!

Considering that tlte bank is paying three
or four thousand a year more in taxes than
it did before the war started (and the
demand on the individual shareholders is of
course a great deal more than that), the
Colonial is really doing better now than it
did then. If anyone had said that a bank
would show such a result after over three
years of a war so costly that it makes every
other one look like a push fight, he would
have been told that he wanted a change.
But you can’t get away from the fact that
nobody is paying for the war—that, though
hundreds of millions are being consumed in
smoke, those hundreds of millions are being
provided merely with lOU’s. In Australia
the printing machine has added very many
millions to the apparent wealth of the coun-
try. Brown lends the Commonwealth
£lO,OOO. He probably borrows the lot from
a bank on the security of tlic Common-
wealth bonds and other assets. The bank’s
advances show £lO,OOO more. The Common-
wealth gets the cash or its equivalent from
Brown through the bank, 'and pays it away
to Smith and Jones and Robinson, who buy
things from Thomson and Giles, who pay it
into the bank again. So the bank’s balance-
sheet. which has been inflated already by
£lO,OOO of advances, is now inflated by
£lO,OOO of deposits. But there isn’t a pen-
n'orth more wealth in the country; all that
has happened is that the Commonwealth
(which includes Brown and Smith and
Jones and Robinson and Thomson and
Giles') has promised to pay Brown
£lO,OOO in .10 years’ time or thereabouts,
while Brown has undertaken to pay the bank
£lO,OOO when 110 call. The increase in bank
figures is therefore likely to be very mis-
leading. They hint at a prosperity which
doesn't exist. They encourage an extrava-
gance which has no justification wfvatev ei.
It there were serious statesmen instead ot
windy place-hunters in office we should by
this time bo taking as serious a view ot the
position as Lloyd George is trying to get
England to take —it would even be some-
thing if we to ok ns serious a view ns Kng-
land is actually taking.
Look at these figures for this particular
bank-

Actually, though the advances are only about
£BO.OOO less than they were just after the
war started, deposits have so increased that
the bank has now £784,003 more liquid
assets. The Bulletin doesn’t say that this
more than 50 p.c. increase in that item is
wholly due to the printing machine; for
Australia has been helping the Allies to win
the war by 7 selling them wool, copper and
other things at anything up to twice the
normal price f.o.b. Australian ports. That
is to sav. the extra price hasn’t been to
meet higher freight and insurance charges.
Through the cowardice of Federal politi-
cians the individual has been allowed to
pocket practically the whole of this war
profit; for the belated war-time profit
measure is a fiasco of the worst possible
description. But even this money is paper
money, again, though the printing machine
hasn’t revolved in Australia. Britain and
the Allies have only paid us for these things
by going into debt; and even we at this dis-
tance shall feel some of the effects of the
struggle to pay 7 that debt —feel it in the
poorer market for our products and probably
in the more strenuous competition with our
infaut manufactures.
Meantime this bank is keeping its bead
and is maintaining liquid practically the
whole of the new- deposits. Thus it, at any
rate, isn’t doing anything to promote the
most unhealthy bopm conditions of trade.
The three-quarter million increase in liquid
assets since the war began is being employed
in London, where call money is very profit-
able. and where Australian banks’ credits
naturally pile up on account of the big pur-
chases of Australian wool, etc., without cor-
responding big purchases of manufactures
for Australia. # #

First, half of the original capital (£14,0001
was written off; and subsequently £1250 of
debentures have been paid off out of profits.
Those and other amounts have allowed the
co. to get rid of the goodwill item and reduce
the leasehold property and plant item from
£10.649 as at September, 1915, to £6346 at
present. The co., which looked quite hope-
less at one time 011 account of its absurd
genesis, has thus made a pretty fair recovery.
Profits are still microscopic: but the co. now
owes on all accounts (including taxation
reserve) just uuder £2OOO, and it takes only
£350 per half-year to pay a dividend at the
rate of K) p.c.-p.a. You wouldn’t, of course,
call the stock even a silver-edged investment:
for. apart from liquor, etc., on hand
(£2578). the asa?ts consist almost wholly
of a lease of tlic Paris House restaurant
and the neighboring Balfour Hotel. The
restaurant is sub-leased. The terms of the
hotel lease have never been publicly dis-
closed : but the directors said a while ago
that they were putting by 7 sufficient to write
off its book value by the time it expired.
What proportion of the £6346 represents
leasehold and what proportion £ represents
plant isn’t mentioned. Plainly if the value
of these assets depends wholly or mainly
upon the lease, then profit ought to be aeon
initiated sufficient to repay most of the e-mini
by the time the leas& expires. So far how
ever, no sinking fund has been accumulated
m cash. Ihe assets apart from leasehold
and plant (including license fees etc) are
only £llO5 ill excess of liabilities and current
dividend. So, though 10 p.c. may look-
attractive, especially on the current price of
the 10s. shares, it is gambling in the dark t
touch the stock without much further InfJ
ination about the leases.

In addition to these outgoings 74 p.c. on the
dividends is paid as commission to the man-
aging director (Joseph Gardiner) ; on the
other side, to the trading profits must be
added £lOOO or thereabouts received by way
of discounts and commission. The capital
is now £54,088, and the liabilities (includ-
ing £1720 reserved for income tax, etc.) are
no more than £30,081. That on such figures
it should be possible to show a profit of
£12,800, after making what appears to be
ample provision for amortization of lease-
holds and depreciation of plant, is duo to
(1) abundance of paper money in Sydney,
(2) energetic management, (3) strictly
cash tri ding. and (4) the investment of
practically the whole resources of the co. in
stock. - Freeholds amount to only £2llO,
leaseholds £2385. plant and fittings £5855,
and prepaid charges and book debts £4718.
Stocks represent no less than £96,072. These
appear to be large: yet they can't represent
many mouths’ trading, seeing that the trad-
ing itrofit for the year was £73,311. That
the stocks are worth £96,072 we have, of
course, to take the say-so of the managers.
But in 1914 and again in 1910 the directors
instructed the auditors to obtain an indepen-
dent report on the stock, and Mr. A. Louden
(than whom no man stands higher in
the trade in N, S. Wales) certified in
1910 that “the stocks surpass the satisfac-
tory condition in which I found them in
August, 1914. I note the conspicuous
absence of depreciated and odd lines. I certify
that I find the stocks up-to-date, clean and
exceedingly well bought.” It seems, then,
to come down pretty well to this: an excep-
tionally capable man runs the business.
With him is associated a small Board, con-
sisting of two directors: hut, as the direc-
tors’ fees amount to only £lOO a year, they
either do a lot for nothing, or practically
everything, so far as is con-
cerned, depends upon one man. From the
investors’ point of view that is the weak
link. For those, however, who are prepared
to take that risk, the return is very- sweet;
for though he would lie an optimist who
would expect that in the years ahead of us
it will be as easy to get 30s. for a pair of
boots as it has been in Sydney lately, two
things are worth noting: (1) last year’s
124 p.c. took less than half the profits, and
(2) while the dividend has in the co.'s six
years averaged 12 p.c., the profit has aver-
aged 25 p.c., and there is a substantial re-
serve to aid the capital in the future.

however, disposed to get out, and bought
another ready-made estate, 70 miles from
the old one, of 290 acres, with adjoining
jungle country available. During the past
year it secured 1000 acres of this new land
and forthwith sold half of it at £3 per acre,
which leaves the balance of the new estate
in the books at £457. These 500 acres will be
brought under cultivation as funds are avail-
able. Really, considering the rotten time
the co. has had. the financial position is
much better than you might expert. The
fl ew plantation (known as the Australasia)
cost £15,500; and though that, and the re-
planting of Port Swettenham, and the new
jungle block have all been paid for. liabili-
ties on June 30 were only £13,154, with
liquid assets against that of about £2300.
This paper isn’t saying that the position is
good. It isn’t, because the co. probably paid,
as things turned out, £25,000 too much for
the Port Swettenham estate.
There is no report this year from the
Australasia estate; and one would have
been interesting to explain how it was that
it yielded only 56,4581 b. as against the esti-
mate of 45.0001 b. This co.’s total produc-
tion was 06,8801 b., and exes., including taxes
and depreciation, came to about 2s. lid.
The rubber sold averaged 2s. 7sd. These
costs won t do. If they don’t improve some-
thing is wrong. No doubt the working of
Swettenham is very expensive just now,
not only because the trees, being scattered,
are more expensive to tap, but because, until
the young stumps grow, weeding will be
costly. Time will mend these defects; but
Heaven only knows how many more are
possible. You only get an idea when a new
manager comes on the ground. One lately
took over the management of Swettenham
as a sideline and-noted : (1) the trees yield
badly, probably owing to past over-tapping;
(2) in the case of some of the older trees
the bark is thin and hard ; (3) there has
been some loss of trees from white ants;
(4) "1 recommend that the engine and
machines be sold,” they being out of date
and, anyway, a luxury for so small an
estate; (5) the estate seems to have relied
to a great extent on local recruiting, which
is not a good system. However, though so
many things are liable to go wrong, there is
good money in the business still. The plan-
tation expect 105,0001 b. this year,
at a cost of £8553. inclusive of capital ex-
penditure; and that is only Is 74d. per lb.
To that, presumably, must be added interest
and management charges, probably another
“4d. to 4d. That aggregate of Is. lid. or
thereabouts is still much too high ; neverthe-
less with half-crown rubber it means a pro-
fit of about £2750 on the estimated yield—
say 5 p.c. on the capital. But exes, "sliould
be very little heavier —probably not 25 p.c.
more—when the output has trebled ; and. all
going well, that should be in four years
from now.
The P. and L. account of the C.S.A.,
Cobar, for the 12 months to July 4, shows a
surplus of £22,16.1 : and out of this £7800,=
2s. per share, will be paid to shareholders
"as soon as the state of the co.’s finances
will permit.” A further £13,200 will be
used up in providing for expenditure on the
new plant and development. The announce-
ment with regard to the div. suggests that
it hasn’t been possible, for one reason and
another, to promptly convert the matte into
cash. Though ore and matte produced (and
apparently sold) has been worth £64,680,
the actual receipts to the end of the year
were only £30.053, while the outgoings were
£34,561. That meant a small o.d. The
P. and L. surplus of £22,161 is arrived at
after paying for all development done during
the year, and writing off £2416 of previous
capital expenditure on opening up and equip-
ping the mine. This is very encouraging,
when it is remembered that No. 1 furnace
wasn't warmed up till late in the year. The
future will be helped by the early com-
pletion of the railway from Cobar and the
provision of a second smelting furnace. But
it would be a still greater help if the co.
had a dependable supply of skilled labor.

Some more of the doubt surrounding the
Mount Tennyson molybdenite field (N.S.W.)
has been cleared away. For months past the
Mammoth Co. has been dislodging a little of
the ore that covers the mountain to an aver-
age depth, so far as ascertained, of about
25ft. Forty tons were sent to Sydney for
treatment. The return from a quarter of
this has been given as £6B gross per ton.
It lias been calculated that less than 1 p.c.
of metal would pay with treatment in a big
way, hut this latest assay is over 13 p.c.
Admittedly this stone was not the worst on
the field, but there is so much of it that
picking is easy. In future, all stone will be
treated on the spot. A crushing and separa-
tion plant is being put together a little below’
the main opening on the Mammoth’s leases,
an d crushing should be seen w r ell before
Christmas. The estimate of 30s. a ton
treatment expenses will then be tested.
Meanwhile stray shares have been rounded
up at from 75 p.c. to 50 p.c. below par (£1)
—mostly those handed to the holders of the
original leases.
Molybdenite producers are now on a
better wicket than they were a few months
back. Till recently they were paid 105 s.
per unit, or £525 a ton, for concentrates
c.i.f. London. Local carriage, insurance,,
sea-freight and other charges worked out at
about £5O a ton. Now the Government will
hand over £5OO a ton on the field, the British
authorities meeting all land and sea trans*
port and insurance costs. This, therefore,
means a rise of about £25 a ton, with a sure
market. Still, producers are not satisfied.
They reckon they should be pouching the
prices paid outside the Empire. In America
the figure has been £lOOO a ton.
As expected, Bourke’s Hill (N.S.VV.) has
been able to declare a sixpenny on its 45,000
shares. This raises the total to £21,475
(,9s. Gd. per share), and if it can shell out
another sixpenny it will have paid its capi-
tal of £22,500. Most of the stock is held
in Melbourne. The co. isn’t able to run
both its plants, and the' output of six tons
of tin concentrates per month is small for
a co. with 45,000 shares. The directors will
have about £l2OO after paying the div.
After all the flutter caused in Stawell
(Vic.) by Klug’s visits there, 8., M. & Co.
are not taking on the Magdala-cww-Moon-
light. Instead, the local Sloane and Scotch-
man's go into possession, paying £BOOO for
a mine and plant that in the misty past
were one of the biggest gold-winners of
Victoria. By joining up the group of
Stawell leases Sloane’s provides itself with
elbow-room for prospecting, and square
miles in which to expound the belief that
when war is over a big float can be engi-
neered for the combined properties. Dick
Hamilton would have swallowed the Mag-
dala for the Great Boulder had the shoots
tipped the beam 14dwt. higher, as the lodes
are big and working conditions good. As
usual, Richard wanted a cert.

Debts owed by Langi Logan South (Vic.)
on September 30 were £l9OO. This was after
£10,900 of calls and gold had been used in
the six months to drive 417 ft. of the inter-
mediate level north and put out wash-dirt
drives north-west into the run of gold which
is being stabbed on that side of the gutter.
Down south at No. 2 rise off the north-east
branch bottom level, 73ft. of payable wash
has been crossed, and a bore put up 550 ft.
west from the south-west level is said to give
“a good prospect.” On work done at both
ends the Board proclaims that '‘some 2500 ft.”
of payable wash has been proved. Why
leave the public to dig out what extent of
wash will be available for the panelling
parties? So far as Bryant goes, his figures
and the work south of No. 4 rise mark out
200 ft. in width. So Langi South to-day
shows 200 ft. x 2500 ft. of what may be ounce
wash. Not much for 14s. a share. Legend tells
that there isn’t much treasure between No. 4
and No. G rises, while there certainly is poor
dirt off No. 7 rise. Whatever there may be
Bryant has “no hesitation in saying, from
the manner in which your mine is opening
up, you have a valuable property.” And a
certificate from him to-day is as good as a
p.n. from Edna Deeps Northey. No wash is
to be hauled till the New Year. Then ex-
traction is promised on a large scale. If so,
Bryant will have to go ahead north and
south, or he risks another hang-up for
development.
No, it is not true that Hampden Clon-
curry has become interested in Papua, and
has sent J. C. Blanchard to Laloki. “Not
interested directly or indirectly,” is secre-
tary Shackell’s disclaimer. This, however,
has happened. Blanchard goes to Papua
as accountant of the Laloki Copper Mines.

It is just 50 years ago since Nash dropped
on to gold at Gyrnpie. The feature of the
field is the enrichment that follows when a
reef leaves the barren conglomerate and
comes in contact with black slate. In 1884
the Wilmot paid a dividend of £36,000 from
a crushing of 470 tons that gave 10.9940 z.
Even during the present year No. 2 North
Columbia crushed 120 tons for llOOoz. gold,
and in six months No. 2 has produced
£13,314 and paid £10.400 in dividends.
The latest return was 3500 z. from 244 tons.
Mount Elliott (Q.) has cooled off its
smelter at Selwyn. The co. tried to pull
down costs, but failed. The smelting of GS2G
tons ore for a return of 3254 tons copper
averages barely 5 p.c., and although this may
be worth £5 per ton of crude ore it isn’t
payable under present conditions. The
Corella, after a struggle, failed to make an
extraction of from 5 p.c. to 0 p.c. pay : and
Hampden, which used to produce blister for
£5O per ton from 10 p.c. ore. isn’t able to
produce it at anything like that cost now.
Then the difficulty of realising on blister has
affected all copper eos.; even Lyell has a very
heavy stock on its hands. Obviously some-
thing has gone wrong with the Common-
wealth Government’s copper-selling arrange-
ments somewhere. When you come to think
ot it, sometuing mostly does go wrong with
its arrangements.
* * * *
Great Fingall (W.A.) showed a loss of
£3395 on last year’s working, and it is
dolefully announced that the outlook is not
sufficiently encouraging to warrant the open-
ing up of any more levels. Chairman More-
ing says that only by irregular drafts of
unskilled labor had any work at all been
done on the mine. Men who had never
worked underground before were roped in
as truckers, and after a little while put on
to machine-drilling. He: reckons that with
an adequate labor supply good profits could
be won from the mine for some time to
come; but under existing conditions the co.
will be lucky if it can pay its way.
The old, old story. Speaking at the half-
yearly meeting of the New Boddington
(W.A.), in which some Perth and Adelaide
money was ventured, the chairman expressed
regret that the lower levels had not come up
to prospectus expectations, but with system-
atic devlopment the manager hoped to strike
other payable bodies, and perhaps pick up
more shoots of gold. There is just a chance.
R. Ditchburn has shifted from Berringa
(Vic.) to Laverton (W.A.), where he runs
the. Childe Harold for the Gordon clan, Hans
Irvine and others. As he paid divs. in Vic-
toria out of 4dwt. stone and was generally
looked on as a safe man, it is strange that
his valuation of 40s. over Oft. of stone at the
bottom level of the Childe Harold should
have given the market an unpleasant sur-
prise. Tasker, of the Mary Mac, reported an
Sdwt. average, so that, considering the length
of the workings, there isn’t such a dreadful
gap between the two estimates. Childe
Harold blossomed in the early Kalgoorlie
days with a London manager and the com-
forts common to those luxurious times. Now
a thrifty Scotch crowd is in control to see
if Ditchburn can repeat his Victorian record.
The mine was worked to 100 ft., and a length
of 400 ft. of stone beaten out, but 12dwt. in
those days was under the fence. Hence the
Gordons’ advent with cash to unwater and
buy out the recent holding party. There are
25,000 10s. shares paid to 4s. 6d., and
18,800 have been issued to the vendors, etc.,
fully paid. The other 6200 are in reserve.
Ivampong Kamunting’s profit for the half-
year to the end of June was £29,289 after
providing for mine amortisation and depre-
ciation ; and £21,000 of it went in quarterly
divs. of eighteenpence. In providing for
mine amortisation the Freemans, who pretty
well control the co. (A. W. Freeman is
managing director and W. A. Freeman is on
the Board), are maKing an effort to handle
the proposition on strict business lines.
When the last yard has been dredged the
mine will be worth nothing and the two
machines will be worth very little: so the
directors propose to accumulate the capital
in cash as the capital represented by mine,
etc., disappears. In other words, they very
properly decline to admit that all the revenue
of a mine in excess of expenditure is profit.
Nine cases out of 10 mining dividends are
not true dividends at all: they are some-
times partly and very often wholly return
of capital. Because the truth has not been
told about this matter not only have exces-
sive demands been made by income-tax
people, but (far more important) extrava-
gant claims have been made by mine-workers.
Of course it depends on the judgment of the
directors whether the amounts set aside will
turn out too much or too little for the pur-
pose. So far. though the co. hasn’t gone
far, it has over £32,000 liquid, apart from
spares and stores. (The capital of the co.
is £140.000.) From a gross revenue
of £51,872 last half-year it pared off £5OOO
for the sinking fund and £3200 for deprecia-
tion ; and then, to be on the safe side, it
added another £7500 to reserves. The
revenue went like this :
Dredge operations .. .. ..£13,222
Management exes. . . . . . . 1,763
Available for profit and plant renewals
and sinking fund .. . . . . 36,887
Total £51,872
And that £36,887 plus £603 of miscellaneous
earnings is cut up this way: Dividends ( =
30 p.c. p.a.) £21.000; put by to refund cap-
ital in mine, £5000; reserved to provide for
repairs and renewals £3200; in hand for
nothing in particular. £8290. The quarterly
Is. 6d. thus ate up only 56 p.c. of the profits,
or about 62 p.c. if you knock off the allow-
ance for depreciation. Naturally in these
circumstances the question of increasing the
dividend has arisen: and “subject to tin
prices remaining at about the present level
if is hoped to pay 2s. during December.”
The outlook, so far as the mine is con-
cerned, is quite good ; both dredges are this
half-year in comparatively poor ground, but
they will get into better before the year is
out, and for two years at any rate No. 1
will be in very good stuff. And the bores
can be pretty well relied on, it seems. Com-
bining the two dredge results the recovery
last half was within a hundredth part of
lib. of the boring.
It is said that Trong is off with the Ronpi-
bon ,90-acre plot, and on with some green
fields offered to it by a Sydney-Malayan
crowd. If Ronpibon is ruled out, manager
Eric Moore won’t be tearful, for he never
took kindly to the idea of shedding a slab of
his selection to help buck up Trong by giving
it a half-interest in profits won for the use
of its dredge. As the 90 acres was stiff stuff
the plant mayn’t have suited the job, and so
Ronpibon may be well quit of the deal. A
yarn goes that the new patch is shallower
and easier material and bores a catty per
cub. yard. If so, Denis Meagher’s fees look
safe for a few years to come.
Briseis Central (Tas.), which as Briseis
Extended got GOO tons tin oxide in about
two years and shut down owing to cost of
steam-pumping in the deep ground, is to be
re-opened, using hydro-electric power from
Columbia Falls. Recent prospecting has
proved a lot of new ground.


WHAT PHYSICIANS PRESCRIBE
FOR NERVES.
THE USE of ORGANIC PHOSPHORUS.
Something over sixty years ago Pelouz. a
French scientist, discovered a form of organic
phosphorus which, when taken into the
human system, was quickly converted into
nerve tissue. Nearly half a century later
Robin, a distinguished French physician, be-
gan a scientific investigation of the use of this
organic phosphorus and its effect upon the
human system, with results that amazed the
scientific and medical world; and to-day it Is
an admitted fact that in the treatment of
those ailments directly or indirectly due to
depleted nervous vitality, such as neuras-
thenia, nervous weakness, premature old age,
insomnia, lack of energy, fatigue, nervous
debility, thinness, etc., it is of great value.
To-day physicians and hospitals everywhere
recognise its merits by its use in ever-increas-
ing quantities. It is therefore a matter of
more than ordinary interest to all such suff-
erers to learn that this organic nerve-building
phosphorus is now obtainable of chemists
everywhere in the form of 5-grain tablets of
bitro-phosphate at a cost so low as to he
within the reach of everyone. One of these
tablets should be taken with each meal, and
the results in practically every case are most
marked. Dull eyes become bright, sleep is
restored to the sleepless, the nerves regain
their strength, thin people put on flesh, and
the whole system becomes charged with that
strength, vitality 7 and energy which makes
life so truly worth while. — Advt.

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
DAVID
JONES
FOR
SMART
MILLINERY
Sydney, October 29, 1917.
My Dear Arini, —
The G.-G. and Lady Helen —Clifford,
A.D.C., at attention- —will eat their Christ-
mas dinner on this side of the Murray.
They’re likely to spend a couple of months
with us.
Governor Goold-Adams and his lady, who
passed through on their way to Melbourne,
will watch the Cup race. He was the sub-
regal who didn't take the pledge to abstain
from boof carnivals.
Returned soldiers had mixed weather as
they came up the Harbor last week. There
were umbrellas in waiting on Thursday and
a sunny, showery sky on Saturday. Also
gloom at the tale of British wives on the
way to Australia. But, after all, how small
is the percentage for the whole 313,000 Bill-
jims in khaki! And, to even things up,
there’s the Australian girl linking up with
Tommy on the other side.
The Horticultural Society had a record
rose-show. There were other blooms, but
the useful spring onion which herded with
a small vegetable display was a modest weed
compared with the champion rose that won
first prize for T. H. Capewell. H. B.
Bradley, lion. sec. these many years, col-
lected a certificate for a bank of hippeas-
trums, the haughty flowers that are appar-
ently a cross between a lily and a zebra.
A Botanic Garden exhibit filled St. James’s
platform with green velvet leaves and the
vivid red flowers that look like flamingoes.
In the amateur-grower’s rose section L. H.
Newman had conspicuous success.
Among N. S. Wales gardens none can
show more unexpected thifigs than one you
come upon suddenly at Mt. Wilson, the re-
markable patch of fat volcanic soil thrown
up over the hungry sandstone of the Blue
Mountains, out beyond Mt. Victoria. More
than 20 years ago Mr. Wynne, a city mer-
chant, founder of the Wynne Art Prize, set
up a country home in this remoteness. I don’t
know whether he ever occupied it. Dying,
he left it to a grandson, who was to come
into possession when he was 23. The young-
ster had his 23rd birthday ; but even as he
was doing up his traps in England to come
this way, the war-gong sounded. Since then
the old caretaker has remained in charge,
and the young man who suddenly changed
his plans has won the D.S.O. Let’s hope,
you and I, that he will yet admire his own
superb rhododendrons.
As I told you, the town is full of aprons
and gaiters. The latest arrival is Kalgoor-
lie’s Bishop Golding-Bird, who used to hand
out the text in Newcastle, and who hasn’t
apologised yet to The Bulletin for preach-
ing an un-Christian sermon about that re-
markable drawing of Norman Lindsay’s at
Christmas, 1912. Perhaps you don’t remem-
ber that “Christmas Carol”? It represented
the world standing in arms and hypocriti-
cally singing “Peace on Earth.” Golding-
Bird didn’t understand it then. Perhaps he
does now. All the same, he hasn’t apolo-
gised. From which I conclude that, though
somebody has since made him a bishop,
nobody has yet made him a gentleman.
When the late Railway Commissioner
Milne was nearing the end of the story he
was filled with one regret—that he should
never see again the son then recently deco-
rated with the D.S.O. Now there’s word of
Major Milne’s wedding in London. No, not
an English bride. The lady used to be
matron of Bathurst Hospital.
The tireless surgeon Fiaschi, after much
hard work at various Fronts, has stepped
ashore in Sydney again. With his young
wife he left for that part of the Stadium
which has Egypt as a jumping-off place.
There Mrs. Fiaschi helped in Red Cross
work, while her tall doctor did duty on
Lemnos and elsewhere. Later he unpacked
his lancet in France, while Mrs. Fiaschi
stitched for the baby that is now wearing its
first long petties. A few hours after scent-
ing the Harbor gums the energetic surgeon
dashed up-country to see his beloved grape-
vines at Tizzana.
After sniffing Manly’s ozone in a morning
drive country pressmen were lunched by
local Mayor Ogilvy and his brother alder*
men. Joe Cook and J. C. L. Fitzpatrick
were the chief political ballast at the pnrtv.
The fact that the country scribes’ president.
Mr. Sullivan, was loaded with an illumi-
nated address shows that the Fourth Estate
is not immune from casualties.
After a long illness, borne with remark-
able fortitude, Mrs. George Black died peace-
fully in her sleep, mere was a thronged
memorial service in St. Steph n’s Kirk, and
a carriage heaped with wreaths lined up in
the long procession to Waverley cemetery.
Still another of the militant Windeyers —a
grandson of the old Judge, Lieut. Charles —
has been killed at the Front. He was the
eldest son of Richard, K.C.
Lieut. Clyde-Price, wdio was married to
Rose Alexander at the Great Synagogue a
week or so ago, is a lately-returned soldier.
After three years in khaki the ’groom felt
entitled to a wedding party of his own. The
bride is a daughter of the late Harry Alex-
ander, who left a well-lined purse to his
family.
Melba writes of changed plans. Instead
of a transfer to a ’Frisco boat at Honolulu
she stayed on the Vancouver ship. “Lady
Susan wants to see Canada....l hear from
C. A. Ellis” (he’s the John Lemmone of
U.S.A., and does the Sovereign Voice’s busi-
ness there) “that I’m to smg eight times
with the Boston Symphony Orchestra, and
look forward to the treat of having Tosea-
ninni as conductor.” Dick Nevill. still in
Canada, promised to dust the snow off the
travellers’ wraps when they reached Ottawa.
In the Arts and
Craft e r s’ annual
show in the Educa-
tion Building’s mul-
berry halls Rhoda
Wager’s exhibit of
art jewellery won’t
let you pass. The
National Gallery
already houses some
of her work, and is
to get one treasure
more. Antique de-
signs of wrought sil-
ver or gold, with a
blister pearl or some
Australian gem set
in a delicate filigree,
are materialised in
necklets and rings.
The craftsmanship is
sure. The designer was Arts mistress in
English schools. Throwing the camels’-hair
brushes aside, she went through the great
crafts shops near Birmingham, and learnt
the technical details of handling metals. In
1913 the clever woman, whose photo. I send
you, came to Australia. She likes it so
much that after the war she is going to
England to bring a sister out to settle
amongst the gum-trees. After spending two
years with a brother who is sugar-planting
in Fiji, she is just back in Sydney, bringing
her deft fingers with her.
The National Gallery trustees had a look
at the show and bought Rhoda Wager's pearl
blister set in a delicate fantasy of filigree
with silver grapes no bigger than a pin’s
head. Myra Mullins’s tooled leather was also
a winner. This was the rich binding of the
Anzac Book, with the haughty waratah in
the centre and small blue wrens in the
corners. Ethel Atkinson’s green-and-white
cup and saucer go to the same address.
Finally the trustees bought a tooled leather
frame, the handicraft of Mrs. Spring. The
show continues in the Education Building
until Saturday. Go and see it. Leather
work by Molly Bamberger, Mildred Creed
and Mrs. Sansom, pottery by Edith Bell
Brown, and brass beaten by Nora Weston
are all worth applause.
Prof. Haswell, one of the most unobtrusive
and learned dons ever caged in Sydney ’Var-
sity, is going to retire after 86 years’ reign
in the chair of Zoology. Two-thirds of the
visitors to Taronga Park don’t know there
is such a perch, and the rest are more in-
terested in the oldest monkey’s way with a
nut. Of course, someone from the other side
is asked to apply for the billet.
Another lucrative Uni. vacancy was filled
lately ; but there was only a local scramble
for this one. For years and years the
learned but irascible Robert Smith was
solicitor to the Council. Lately, after he had
had his last game of bridge—with a fierce,
piping comment on his partner’s play—the
cartload of deeds and other pink-bowed
documents went to the office of Sly and
Russell. George Sly is one of the few
Doctors of Law practising on the six-and-
eightpenny side of the profession; and
partner Russell had a very brilliant ’Varsity
career. So the others in the scramble felt
that the Council had done itself justice.
The Women Painters’ Sketch Club is show-
ing itself in the inner chamber of the li.A.
Society’s rooms. There are no frames —a
sign of the times in evidence also at the- last
show. And yet, remarkable as the Philistine
may think it, sales have been reasonably
good. Mrs. Hedley Parsons and Mrs. F. W.
Parsons contribute virile work. Mrs.
Dalgarno’s wind-swept trees beside the
waves catch the eye. There’s a genuine
breeze in this sketch L. Peapes promises
to forge ahead. And student Betty Solomon’s
face is in the same direction. Mabel
Barling’s zoo specimens are lean and hungry-
eyed as ever. For the rest there is most
profit in the small pictorial calendar that
sells at a few shillings.
Grace Stafford and her Strollers are strik-
ing a new vein in “All of a Sudden Peggy 7.
This will be Peg's first appearance in Aus-
tralia. She takes the p.atiorm in St. James s
Hall on November 2. On succeeding nights
various hungry comforts funds, including the
7th Artillery, the Flying Corps, the Prisoners
of War, and the 2nd D.A.C. and 22nd How-
itzer, will collect the profits.
For the last two or three months Sydney’s
favorite pianist, Yvonne Leverrier Charvin,
has been seriously ill. To be near the in-
valid her sailor husband has temporarily
given up command of the Messageries boat he
takes to and from a French is.and that I
musn’t mention. “Too much music” is the
primary cause of the trouble.
The racy “Beauty Shop' playlet at the
Tivoli filled the stalls with male persons who
drank in the first draught of our sex’s
(alleged) secrets with loud applause.
As every make-up parlor advertises its
desire to do everything, up to skinning
its clients, in clarion tones, there were
no real mysteries. The fun is spon-
taneous, though it’s almost combustion
on the part of the lady who is forgotten in a
bath of boiled electricity. Her wails float
over the new curls which Vera Pearce, as
the Beauty Parlor’s High Priestess, is pin-
ning on the scalp of Marie King Scott, other-
wise the frumpish little lady from Okla-
homa, U.S.A. As a counterblast to the
Beauty Shop, which is dragging the male
population to its shrine, some rival show
could start a Fashionable Barbery. Then
the Eves could hurry along to see how Man
hits up the passing years.
Even the Oldest Inhabitant can’t remem-
ber such a season for wild flowers. Nature
never sends us tears but she presently tries
to kiss them away ; so the over-plentiful rain
that spoiled some of the wheat-harvest has
been followed by such bush growth of grass
and bloom that every young bird chirps the
wonders of the world it has been born into.
From the East, where the Pacific rolls in,
to the West, where there’s a wire fence to
keep out the wild S. Australians, it is the
same everywhere. The glory of the wara-
tahs on the Blue Mountains (there are
iountless acres of them- out towards Mount
Wilson and on a thousand hillsides) is
matched by the splendor of Sturt’s desert-
pea over across the Darling. “We can gather
the brilliant blooms all round the town,” a
Broken Hill man writes me—“and until this
season we haven’t been able to do that for
20 years.”
If the cat has nine
lives Boyd Cable
must be two cats. As
yet I doubt if any-
thing much worse
than a scratch has
come his way in over
three years’ service.
Here is the photo of
this soldier - author
w h o amidst the
roar of British bat-
teries —he joined up
in the Artillery in
England—found time
to w rite “Between
the Lines” and “Ac-
tion Front” and bar-
rowloads of vivid
stuff for The Bul-
letin. Since then.
“Grapes of Wrath” (Fred Leist decorated
the cover) has come along. Australia was
the literary foster-mother of this astonishing
writer, who can be graphic anywhere.
Lately, having half an hour to put in while
flying the English Channel, he reeled off half
a column of soldierrgtuff which I expect you
read a few weeks ago without a thought of
the remarkable conditions under which it
was written. Later (for not getting excite-
ment enough among the field-guns he is an
aviator now) he may tell us what Berlin
looks like from the silvery side of a summer
cloud. Before the war Boyd Cable was a
wanderer over the earth, with more affection
for the sea than the land—which is how he
happened to be on the other side when the
first guns boomed.
Octavius Beale, his wife and two daugh-
ters are still in England. Passports for
women on the high seas are very wisely re-
fused except under special circumstances.
But there’s war-work of every shade for the
willing, and the Beale girls are deep in Red
Cross currents. Talking of shades, they men-
tion the heroic Canary girls. Many a soldier
who passes them in the street salutes these
young women. With skin and very often
hair dyed a sickly yellow from the explosives
they handle in certain munition-work, they
are freely giving their youthful cream-and-
roses. to their country. Before the poison
gets into their blood they are moved to other
war-work. But—will the rose-bloom evev
come back? 1
The Boy Scout broke out in his first annual
sports meeting the other afternoon. It w «‘
christened by a gentle shower that laid the
dust while the Summer Hill troop, swelhiu
with pride, took over a recently-won banner
and shield. Deputy-Governor Cullen de-
livered the goods. The splendor of a Scouts’
b('st boy —possibly a, sergeant—is almost
unequalled in those tame days of unadorned
khaki. lie is hung about the chest with
loops and tassels. And on his shirt-forearm
are emblazoned so many talismans that no
knight of old could have worn much more
There’s even a flatiron—flame-colored—
emblazoned here and there. A symbol
neatly added, maybe, that the youthful war-
rior’s broomstick may not feel lonely.
Mrs. Taylor Darbyshire. whose husband
has had a lift in the J.C.W. firm, is to
arrive from Melbourne this week. Her hus-
band is already in harness, and house- and
school-hunting will be the lady’s first job
Mrs. Darbyshire was Katie Rickards of
Queensland, a professional musician.
Johanna’s mention last week of the
Mary Elizabeth tea-rooms in Sydney has
brought forth a story from a great friend of
Melba’s. This friend, wishing to do the new
tea-room a good turn, caught Melba in Syd-
ney before she boarded the American liner
and thus entreated the star: “Nellie, darling,
I want you to-come with me to a new lunch-
room and have angels on horseback and”
“My good woman,” interrupted Nellie dar-
ling as she pulled off her hat, jabbed the hat-
pins into a sofa-cushion and began the
Caesarian operation of reading, writing and
dictating seven letters at once—“my good
woman, if you offered me seraphim in'motor-
cars I would not have time to look at them
now. On my way back, perhaps.”
The Army Service Corps committee—Mrs.
Braddon in the chair—had its second annual
wash-up this week. Its haunt is 369 George-
street. and of course it needs more money and
more help. There isn’t a comforts committee
that doesn't. Some day, I hope, a kindly
statistician will produce a list of the bat-
talions and batteries that haven’t got any
comforts fund or committee at all. There
are dozens of them—composite units mostly,
formed of the remnants of units that have
been cut to pieces—and very uncared-for and
forgotten some of them must feel.
Chatswood is running the mower over the
big oval for its Hallowe’en fete on Satur-
day. The patriotic hat catches the shower.
Mrs. Mander Jones, president of the Dev-
onshire-street Kindergarten committee, is on
the warpath for more funds to extend the
suggested Exhibition Park school. Her big
garden at Boonara, in Wahroonga, will be
the scene of the pillage this Saturday. It’s
to be called a village fair.
The newest idea in the pitiful hunt after
recruits materialises this week. The notion
is that women should back up the
men’s Committee and become members
pledged to land one recruit apiece—or perish
in the attempt! They will probably perish,
a good many of them. Still a few reinforce-
ments may be coaxed or bullied in this way;
and as our Federal politicians have cut such
a poor figure, we can’t afford to reject a
scheme that will land even half a dozen
recruits.
Yours affectionately,
VANDORIAN.

BEFORE T purchased I looked
at many types of disc playing
instruments. Fine though
some of them were, the differ-
ences seemed trifling. All looked
alike. One may have given a little
better results in instrumental'music,
and another with the human voice.
And then my quest led me to the
NEW INSTRUMENT, the Aeolian-
Yoealion, and all others faded from
mind.
In the Yoealion T heard music
I never dreamed a Phonograph
could produce. Sweet, full rich-
ness of tone vibrant with the
very quality of life, delicate
tonal tints marked the differ-
ence of instrument and instru-
ment. Here was the model to
satisfy my desires, its appeal
was irresistible. I was charmed
with the “GPADITOLA” ex-
pression device; by gentle pres-
sure the music seemed to melt
to my touch, swelling forth to
a full flood of melody at will;
what joy at expressing my own
feeling, and then at the end
of the selection all was silent;
it had automatically stopped.
The Aeolian-Vocalion
THE GREATEST OF ALL DISC PLAYING IN-
STRUMENTS WAS THE ONE OF MY CHOICE.

Melbourne, October 29, 1917.
My Dear Yarrie, —
Do you recall the Brasseys’ reign in
the governing job? Part of their entourage
was the jolly Freeman-Thomases, good
sports and non-swanks. Mrs. Freeman-
Thomas, a very pretty woman then, a daugh-
ter of Brassey by his first wife, had one child
—a baby-boy when they were here. Well,
that infant, Gerard, a Grenadier Guardsman
when the war started, has been killed in
action. Freeman Thomas has been govern-
ing in Bombay these few years, under his
later title of Lord Willingdon.
An upper-crust patriotic matinee filled the
King’s Theatre on Saturday, much to the
profit of the Returned Soldiers’ Association.
The National Service Girls played “The
Rivals,” with an all-girl cast backed by an
all-girl orchestra. The musicians enlivened
the proceedings by making mince of an over-
ture. The dear thing with the baton giggled
helplessly, and the other dear things dittoed.
Then they all became demure, took a firm
and uncompromising grip of the trombone
and the bass cymbals and started over again.
They did very well, too.
General Sellheim and his lady were in a
box; and Captain Le Maistre and hundreds
of other boys from Broadmeadows were
handy. Mrs. Craven led an army of
sweets girls, all dressed in white muslin
flares, with coy roses pinning on a neck-curl
in century-old fashion. Mrs. Craven's daugh-
ter, Miss Mackintosh, and a daughter of
artist Webb from Sydney hawked sweets.
The players were highly diverting. They
were so obviously girlish in spite of their
breeks, and fiery Lucius O’Trigger (Eileen
Deegan) had trouble with her powdered hair
all through the duel scene. Audrey Ander-
son, as Captain Absolute, was an exception.
She was convincingly masculine.
Marie Tempest introduced “Good Gracious,
Annabelle,” at the Theatre Royal on Satur-
day night to a delighted audience. The house
was packed, a conspicuous item being a
Nance O’Neil type of woman who, from the
gloom of an upper box, turned a square
acre of naked back to the crowd. The
Grahams were penned in another box; the
Millses, from Gippsland, were in the stalls ;
and Stead, from Maoriland, appeared in the
latest fashion in Y-shaped linen shirt-front.
Walter Kirby, arranging liis forthcoming
annual song-recital, is the busier owing to
months of enforced idleness. Nasal haemorr-
hage was the enemy. He reappeared last
week to sing before his dear friend Lady
Helen at the Edward Millers’ big party, given
to a number of Red Cross notables. Lady
Goold-Adams and Lady Ellison Macartney
were amongst the guests. The hostess ap-
peared in a dizzily-fascinating black gown
and all her diamonds. Jewels on wisps of
tulle bodices were in profusion. Yards and
yards of pale brocade skirts took up twice
as much room as the inside them.
Kirby came in for warm congratulations by
their Exes., and mere Australians murmured
in chorus. Barker tuned his harp and Stella
Power was in great form. A Bananaland
baritone, Harry Kitson, carried off a share
of the honors. The supper was inspiring—
to those who find inspiration in supper. Some
merely find indigestion and a ride on that
mad beast Nightmare.
Muriel North, not being robust enough to
join the John Forrest triumphal car on the
East-West railway, is sheltering at the Alex-
andra Club under the eye of Mrs. General
Foster. Auntie Forrest had a birthday the
night before embarking on the great jaunt,
and niece Muriel celebrated the occasion with
a huge movie party. Lady Doris, a couple
of gent.-lielps, the Bridges chicks and a lot
of other Toorakites were included. It was a
“Dutchman's shout,” all hands paying for
themselves.
The late Winthrop Hackett’s young widow
is to marry Frank Moulden, of Adelaide,
next year. Frank's future missus used to be
a Drake-Brockman, and therefore belongs to
one of Perth's primordial families. One bro-
ther, Colonel Edmund Drake-Brockman,
D. 5.0., is at the Front, and two others have
taken part in notable actions of the war.
The newly-engaged dame is the author of a
large and interesting family of young
Hacketts and a cookery-book.
Ida Barnard, a Melbourne beauty of a
dozen years ago, has been married in London
to Frank Otter, who is charged with being
an English racing man burdened with
wealth. When he induced Ida to share his
affliction he was an invalided lieutenant of
the sth Dragoon Guards. She was then war-
working as a nurse in Lady Lytton’s hospi-
tal. Ida is a magnificent blonde of the statu-
esque type.
Bob Greig, who looms large in present-
day J.C.W. productions, in 1005 tried his
hand at the impresario business. He pro-
duced at the Melbourne Princess’s and Bijou
such musical plays as “In Town” and “The
Gaiety Girl.” The casts were partly ama-
teur ; they included Hal Cohen, now Harold
Colonna, who has appeared at Covent Gar-
den ; Clarice Malyon, now doing good work
on the staff of the ’Varsity Conservatorium;
Harry Quealey, now in vaudeville; Law-
rence Hardinge, now on active service; Irene
Dillon, now a headliner in the variety world ;
Kitty Henningham, in a boy’s part; Ruby
Gray, now of the Albert-street Conserva-
torium staff; Georgie O’Mara, who after-
wards played character old-women with
J.C.W., but at that time was the belle of
Richmond ; Addie Hine, who afterwards ap-
peared in London as principal dancer in
Edwardes productions; Alice Gifford, now
Mrs. Hal Gye; Ida Barnard, the big blonde
St. Kildaite I’ve just told you about; Elsie
Baxter, as pretty as a picture; and Mrs. J.
T. Champion, now footlighting in U.S.A.,
sister of Albert Whelan, the mimic. The
amateurs who are still amateurs included
popular Jack Dane, now in England ; Nor-
man Fenner, now on active service; Jack
Strong, then a mighty Melbourne footballer,
whose singing was as strenuous as his ruck
work ; Tommy Cochrane, whom we all love;
Elsie Flemming, now Mrs. Beaumont Smith ;
Maggie Brenan, sister of Jennie Brenan,
who saw to the ballets, which were danced
by the youngest and prettiest dancers ever
seen. They included Mollie Wilson, now
married and living at the Hague, Holland ;
Flossie Dickenson, now Mrs Wenman;
Dorothy Brunton, now Dorothy Brunton;
Cora Hamilton, a dancer of great promise,
who has left the stage ; Freda Stach. Ruby
Granger and Marjorie Smith. Leon Lam-
bert held the baton over what was surely a
very remarkable lot of to-bes.
The Lucky Bag Day fight has settled down
into an amiable collaboration of all con-
cerned. Hennessy is lion treasurer, and
Mrs. WooTcott and’ Mrs. McCubbin are work-
ing together in a sisterly manner. The skin-
ning of an unprotesting public is to be done
through lucky-bags, sold at one shilling each.
Every receptacle will contain some article of
value, from a hairpin to a block of land. One
prize, to be had by someone for two shillings,
is a small sheep-run, less this year’s clip.
Dolores will sing in the Town Hall on
Friday, November 16, for the benefit of blind
soldiers of Victoria. The singer’s tour for
her own benefit will be commenced very soon.
Mrs. Hewison and some other St. Ivilda
dames~hre preparing plans and specifications
for a sock-knitting competition. All entries
become the property of the promoters’ stall
at the Luna Park Carnival —fixed for Decem-
ber 8 to 15. There will be an entrance fee,
of course, 'and prizes, not to mention the
pleasure of doing something to warm some
mud-sodden lad in France.
Lady Helen needs the voluntary aid of a
typiste for Red Cross work. There shouldn’t
be much difficulty in filling that vacancy.
Every prisoner of war costs the Red Cross
unit in Australia £5O, and Lady Helen has
been called up by headquarters for money.
The “last-shilling” people are particularly
invited to respond. The estimate is that the
coming year will mop up in one way and
another quite £200,000.
At the M.C.C. carnival, where the Eques-
trian Club had a nut-stall, three “leading
ladies” stood at the receipt of custom in
their riding-togs. The appearance of an un-
horsed her, clad mostly in hims, cold and
comfortless about the knees on a wet and
dismal afternoon, is not a joyous spectacle,
and the nut-stall failed to attract the cus-
tom it might have done under brighter skies.
Though the more sedate equestriaunts stuck
closely to the shelter of the peanut bureau,
some of the more irrationally-clad misses,
draped in glad skirts and silk stockings,
strayed further afield and helped to run the
spinning-jenny next door, which immediately
started to do a roaring trade, with Ilughie
Trumble beaming on their efforts in his best
manner.
Adelaide’s consignment:—
We have had an unusual number of distinguished
pilgrims lately, including the Governor-General, who
inspected the Town Planning Exhibition, spoke at
the conference, and met the delegates at Government
House at tea, all in the six hours that his train-stop
allowed him. Lady and Miss Macartney also dropped
off on their way to Westralia, via the East-West
line; and so did Justices Isaacs, Duffy, Rich and
Powers. And Admiral Creswell looked in to give
his benediction to the Navy Day demonstrations.
The report of Norwood’s Red Cross Circle provoked
Lady Galway’s congratulations at the annual meeting
on Thursday. The circle has only 80 members, but
nearly £2OOO was collected during the year, and of
that all but about £BO was spent.
No German in this State will have a vote if John
Yerran can have his way. The second reading of his
Disfranchisement Bill is down for next week, but
y’see, a number of win-the-war members of
the House are largely dependent on German votes
for their seats, and if they lost their seats they
wouldn’t be able to explain how to down the Ger-
mans. Understand ?
The Australians’ share in the last offensive is
bringing its tale of casualties. Captain Redmond,
a son-in-law of Commissioner of Public \\ orks Bice,
was killed; so was the Hampden Carrs’ eldest son
(only 21), and Pte. G. W. Jacob, the eldest son of
the late Henry Jacob, of the Survey Department.
News has also come through that Capt’.
G. E. Wells has been killed in action. He enlisted
as a trooper in the 3rd Light Horse, left here
three vears ago with the Ist Division, was through
Gallipoli and heavy fighting in France, and worked
his way to an artillery .captaincy.
The St. Peter’s Flower Show, with roses and carna-
tions as the exhibits, was a glorious advt. for that
district’s amateur gardeners, in spite of a spell of
belated winter that came the day before to fluster
many of the blooms. The Show, plus a concert,
brought joy to the local Red Cross and Trench Com-
forts committees, to whose funds the proceeds go.
Gas and electric power and lighting restrictions
are removed, for which Allah be praised I To run
a Red Cross tea-room or cook for a Trench Comforts
shop and 20 or so a week is no parlor game
when you are reduced to methylated spirit or green
wood as your sole means of heating.
Lieut. Denny, ex-Attorney-General, at present in
a London hospital, is finding some balm for his
wounds. He has been awarded the Military Cross.
Audrey Anderson, who has lately gained
prominence with the Repertory players (she
was the flower-seller in Gregan McMahon’s
recent production of “The Pigeon”) and the-
National Service Girls (as Captain Absolute
in “The Rivals”), is to make her professional
debut under the Bailey and Grant manage-
ment. She will be the Player Queen in lan
Maclaren’s forthcoming “Hamlet.”
Philip Morton, who owns part of Bron-
zetti —whether head or tail I'm not sure —
got together a bunch of his fellow disciples
to help him celebrate his win. He regaled
them at Menzies’ on chubby birds and wassail
bowls. Amongst those who ate their way
over every hurdle were the Clive Leonard
couple, the racing Leslie Stuarts, Doc Crow-
ley and his missus (who is sister-in-law to
the host), Mrs. Well-dressed Wullie Collins
(from Bananaland) and John Spencer
Brunton, whose brother’s horse ran the
winner to a neck.
A tripper from the Woodrow Wilson re-
public announces that the auburn-haired lady
who for a long time was Melbourne’s most
absorbing topic (especially during the rac-
ing season) is now in N’York. and lias for
her most devoted admirer a millionlieir. My
informant ‘( a man, my dear, so we are not
compelled to believe him) added that even
the population of a fashionable N’Yark
restaurant puts down its cocktail and stares
when Constance enters in one of her wonder-
ful gowns. Alas! we have nobody among us
nowadays who knows how to wear dresses as
she did.
The Melbourne Zoo elephant must have
the Spring restlessness. As a rule ami-
ability is his strong suit. The other day,
however, Dorothy Merritt, a Junoesque girl
from Ivew, paying him a call, was grasped
round the waist and whirled aloft. When
her alarmed parent saw his offspring thus
embraced he expostulated with the keeper,
who assured him that it would be all right
presently. And so it came to pass. Yet,
woman-like, Dorothy insisted on fainting in
two positions.
Lalva Pratt, the just-out-of-school daugh-
ter of the Ambrose Pratts, has put aside the
usual frivolity of the newly-fledged flapper
and gone to work in the London Bank, in
Collins-street.
Lieut. Geoffrey Wall, the Australian avi-
ator who was killed recently, was not a
relative of the Front Webbs but a great
friend of the family. He was, a son of Mrs.
M. J. W. Wall, of Kew, and a Melbourne
’Varsity student who had just cleared at
Wesley.
Fritz Hart, of the Conservatorium, has
made an acceptable offer to Cacchali, the
bass singer of the recently-scattered Italian
Opera Co. Cacchali will teach singing and
how to study opera. He has a repertoire of
70 works, so nobody need go short.
Died of wounds in France, Captain
Freddy Moule, elder son of solicitor Arthur
Moule. Another Moule boy. Geoff, air-scouts
for his country. Cousin Humphrey, Judge
Moule’s eMer boy, fell in the early days of
the trouble, and brother Billy has 'just' cele-
brate# his eighteenth birthday by joining
the Australian Flying Corps.
Young Hamilton Wilson, only son of ex-
banker Tom Wilson, was killed on service
last week. He set out with the first lot and
had gained a Military Medal just before he
went west.
There is only one son of J. P. Nicholas,
of Trafalgar, Gippsland, in the firing-line
now. There were four. Lieut. B. F.
Nicholas, who left as a private in May, 1915’
went through Gallipoli, and after going to
France won his commission and the Mili-
tary Cross, has just been killed in action.
Some months ago the same fate befell his
brother, Major G. M. Nicholas, D. 5.0., who
-had returned to the Front after his marriage
in London to Hilda Rix, a Victorian girl.
A third brother was recently invalided home.
Carl Pinschof’s Macedon cottage, Iloe
Warte, is up for sale. The pursey Pinschof
couple used to dispense prodigal hospitality
on this mountainside. On a balcony over-
hanging the valley Arthur Streeton painted
“Australia Felix” and other studies. In the
summer the house was usually filled with
musical and other celebrities, and Carmen
and Elizabeth, the Pinschof girls, ran about
hatless. Now !
The Simon Fraser fete raked in £6OO for
the Red Cross —good business, seeing that
if was held on race day and raining as it
did when Mrs. Noah fled in her gumboots
into the Ark.
Helen, the youngest of the Ottawa Camp-
bell tribe, has decided to change her glad
wrappings for the uniform of a nurse, and is
already in the Queen Victoria Hospital.
Another Campbell girl spends her days at
the Y.M.C.A. Soldiers’ Club.
Willie Harper, the second son of Robert,
is on his way back to Australia. He was
one of the Ivnuts until a troublesome cough
sent him prospecting for a remedy among the
pines of California. He found it—partly;
also he found Miss Susan Philips, a San
Francisco belle, and persuaded her to change
her name. It's back to the pines for Willie
after showing off his bride to the home folk.
E. J. Kilpatrick, the tall young theatrical
manager with the smile that won’t wear off,
sends a coo-ee from Chicago: “It was quite
Australian in Allen Doone’s dressing-room
this evening. There was Himself, Edna
Iveeley. Hugh Ward, and one or two others.
We talked nothing but Australia, and the
burden of the song was —We All Want to
Go Back !”
Keep this to yourself. Cyril Maude is
appearing on the movies in "Beauty and the
Barge.” He makes a fascinating study of
the old captain.
Tours sincerely,
JOHANNA.

How to Save 10 Shillings
By Making Your Own Cough Mixture.
(By a Qualified Chemist.)
Housewives may now prepare their own family
cough mixture at an enormous saving of hard
cash, arid without the slightest trouble, thanks
to the discovery of HEENZO (registered name
for MEAN'S ESSENCE). By simply adding
HEENZO to water and sweetening according to
easy directions printed on the label, a pint of
superior-quality medicine for coughs, colds,
croup, influenza, bronchitis and sore throat may
be prepared in a few moments. A pint of
ordinary remedies, put up in a lot of bottles,
would cost at least 12s. HEENZO costs only
2s. Each bottle used, therefore, effects an
actual cash saving to the customer of 10s. —a
big consideration these times.
Monev cannot buy a better cough remedy than
the home-made HEENZO mixture. It is warm-
ing, soothing and healing, reduces feverishness,
loosens phlegm, and all ys bronchial irritation at
once. Being free from all habit-forming drugs,
such as paregoric, laudanum, morphia, or other
opium compounds, HEENZO (HEAN’S ES-
SENCE) is as safe and good for little children
as it is for adults.
If HEENZO (HEAVS ESSENCE) is not
obtainable from your local chemist or store do
not accept any inferior imitation, should such
be offered to you, but send direct to G. W.
HE AN, Manufacturing Chemist, 178 C'astlereagh
Street, Sydney.
SPECIAL NOTICE. To protect both
the public and myself against imitators (of whom
a number have come to light) I have trade-
marked the word HEENZO, and all packets con-
taining my preparation, manufactured after
April, 1917, bear the words HEENZO (regis-
tered name for HEAN’S ESSENCE). Therefore,
if when you ask for HEAN’S ESSENCE you are
handed “HEENZO,” you will know you are get-
ting the original and genuine money-saving cough
and cold remedy.

The TOP-NOTCH Scotch
ABORIGIN-
ALITIES
“Eloc”: The answer to “Leo Lear ” who
asked why sheep always make to the tap end of a
trough (B. 13/9/’l7) is that instinct tells them
that the water should be cooler and fresher there.
When a few hundred sheep have drunk the water
does not smell too well, and owners make an error
in not running the liquid from troughs frequently.
Also, instinct tells a sheep that the top of a rise
is a good place to camp, as it is drier. Did I
mention the quick drafting done at Wilga Downs
station (N.S.W'.)? McLeod (he of the- dogs), in
giving delivery of a mob of wethers, ran 1700 sheep
through the race in 17 minutes.
# * * *
“Tail Race”: “B.B.” (B. 13/9/T7) calls
attention to the luck of the man who cut through a
plug of dynamite with the axe. Here’s another.
Charlie Arnelson was digging a race to bring the
water on to his claim at Mafeking (Vic.), when he
stuck his pick into a jamtin and yanked it out from
between two roots. Contents: nine plugs of dyna-
mite and half a box of caps! Hearing a decorated
oration I hurried up to investigate, and found
Charlie putting on his coat to go to the post office
to send for a Tatt.’s ticket. You don’t get any excite-
ment out of cutting dynamite with an axe. But don’t
smite a cap with anything more solid than a sausage
till I’m well on my way to the horizon.
* * * *
“A. 2” : According to “H.V.E.” (8.20/9/T7)
“scientists say that the echidna and the playtpus
belong to the most ancient class of vertebrate ani-
mals living.” A better acquaintance with the sub-
ject would convince him that such is not the case,
and that no modern zoologist of any note ever said
that it was. Scientists agree that platypus, echidna
and a few other monotremes now living are samples of
the earliest true mammal and are vertebrate. But
vertebrates set up in business as submarines millions
of years before a monotreme laid its first egg.
Would like to hear of any scientist who found mono-
treme remains in strata prior to the Triassic period.
The earliest true bony fishes, selachii, are found in
the Silurian, and they are vertebrate.
A SPIRITUAL GUIDE.
TOURIST : “Any places worth visiting around
here?”
BILL: “A few, mate; but the shanty over the
rise keeps the best liquor.”
“Wart”: I cannot understand “E.S.S. s
infatuation for the music of the grey butcher-bird.
Maybe the mainland species is a better singer than
his Tasmanian relation, though the only difference
in appearance is the larger and stronger bill of the
islander. The latter is known as the jackass, or the
talking jackass, and his call is a cheerful medley of
discordant sounds, very often translated as “That’s
your raggetty, raggetty boy, that’s your raggetty
boy.” The butcher-bird is a bit of a Hun. I have
often found small birds and nestlings hung up on
the thorns of his larder, alongside a mixed collection
of beetles. In some parts it is impossible to keep a
canary without having a double-fronted cage, other-
wise a headless pet will be found, the missing item
having provided a meal for Jack. He seems to find
further amusement in hanging around the poultry
yard and frightening six months’ growth out of the
hens and chickens, but I’ve not heard of him doing
any other damage there.
A PROGRESSIVE CHAIRMAN.
“This meetin', gentlemen, 'as been called to
discuss the proposition that it is advis-
able to build two back rooms on to the
front of the institoot, and those who are
unanermous will say 'Aye' and those who
are against the motion are a disgrace to
this town.”
“Crooked Maginnis”: Now then, butt in
and help the war loan with a better story
than this. While Lieut. J. C. Marduel, of
the Flying Corps, was dropping pamphlets boom-
ing the loan, Emily Manning, housekeeper for a
Melbourne suburban dentist,- 5 saw a laughing-jackass
flying over the housetops with something white in its
bill. The cargo dropped as the bird swooped under
some ’phone wires, and Miss Manning picked it up.
Ic was a war-loan circular, which apparently the
kookaburra had caught in mid-air, and was taking
home to Mrs. Kookaburra. The catch was a good
one, for the wind was so high that some of the
circulars dropped from the ’plane were found at
Bentleigh and Heatherton, 12 miles from the city.
“Mookingah”: Bet me enter an empty
whisky bottle and glass placed carefully at the head
of the grave of a departed sinner in a cemetery in
the North-west for the unique headstone stakes.
“Bodach”: What is the record stick of
sugarcane—weight and length? In “Noah’s Ark,”
Bundaberg (Q.), are exhibited two saccharine sap-
lings, one 19ft. long, the other not so long but
thicker and weighing 211 b. The sticks do not, of
course, include the green top.
* * * *
“Oyo” : The reason that the camel inflicts
so severe a wound in biting is chiefly because he
bites and pulls at the same time. If he gets .a
fair hold, say, of an arm, the flesh is likely to be
ripped to the bone for some length, perhaps off. I’ll
admit that they are often treacherous, but so are
horses and cattle. Bull camels, like other bulls, are
always worth watching. Cows are tricky, and for
ever on the growl. As with women, niggers, horses,
snakes, etc., a man is often to blame if he gets
hurt. In one such case, a prospector (I think he
had a few in) was warned by the owner of four
camels and by me of one of tbe beast’s man-eating
habits. “I’d like to see the lopsided I’d
be frightened of,” he said, and shortly after began
to fool with the beasts. The bull grabbed him by
a leg, and made a windmill of him until cracked
on the skull with a bar of drill steel. The bones
in the injured limb looked like a spilled box of
matches. It’s a good plan to have little to do with
bulls when in season. Their appearance is enough
to make a slaughterman bolt. Also, keep clear
when two bulls are having a scrap, unless you are
armed with a thumping big, live firestick. Fire is
about the only thing I know of that is likely to
separate them and at the same time leave you in
one piece. If allowed to “box on,” one takes the
count for good. The K.O. is administered
thus. No. 1 gets his head and neck between the
front legs of the other, gives a Donald Dinnie lift,
and No. 2 is on the mat. Quick as lightning, No. 1
is astride the neck and using his weight and the
hard, cornlike lump on his chest as a battering
ram, smashes the loser’s skull. Always insist on a
trial lift if buying a camel, and don’t let his head
be pointing downhill when making the test, as he
would easily in that position hoist a load that on
level ground would beat him. The above is really
about dromedaries, not camels, but droms. are camels
in most parts of Australia. By the way, they
sweat in one place only—at the back of the head,
but all the time they stink, all over.
“Exsul” : “Te Wliare” (B. 27/9/T7) lias
got it wrong. De Quiros, the navigator, never
sighted the Terra Australis of his dreams. Neither
was he a Spaniard. He voyaged out of Peru on two
occasions in search of the “Java Major” of the
Dutch, once in 1095 as Mendana’s chief pilot, and
again in 1605; with Torres as his lieutenant. He got
no nearer to W’oollahra Point, Port Jackson, than
the island of Espiritu Santo, though he firmly
believed in the existence of the southern continent,
which he estimated to be “spacious, populous and
fertile.” Mutinous sailors on his ship made a
return to South America imperative, and Torres was
quietly left to prosecute the search alone. The
latter in his report to the Spanish ruler openly
accused his quondam leader of desertion.
“F.C.”: Can anyone say what has hap-
pened to my Cootamundra wattles? They are seven
years old and flowered beautifully this year; but on
going to get a few seeds the other day I found, in
place of the usual pod with its six or seven black
seeds inside, bunches of what look exactly like
diminutive apples, green one sids, and red the other,
about the size of a large pea. And they haven t a
sign of a seed inside them. Some of the trees round
the countryside have produced similar fruit; others
show the normal seed-pods.
• * * *
“Namoi” : Apropos of “Quorn’s” resource-
ful blackboy (B. 27/9/’l7) who used his breeks to
fill the watercart, the bucket having been forgotten.
Some years ago I struck Goodo.oga, on the Queens-
land border, in a heat-wave. On the upstairs veran-
dah of the hotel I saw what appeared to be a “jelly-
bag” hanging between two chairs with a basin
underneath to catch the drip. I was going to in-
vestigate what sort of fruit was being strained, when
the local medico ran out and withdrew two bottles
of liquor from the apparatus. It was merely a pair
of old duck trousers tied round the calf of each leg,
filled with water and used as a refrigerator.
“Dr. Nil”: In re one “Melos” (B.
11/10/’17 —my birthday, by the way, so I can’t tell
a lie), to wit. In the Early Days the hawkers and
other Chows in the Bingara (N.S.W.) district
used to set great store by iguana-gall. It took the
place of the little plasters of colored paper that their
own doctors in Canton used to apply to the patho-
logical spot, and thereby cure everything from bug-
bite to cerebral tumor. I had just got my license
to kill, and was using it in Bingara in the middle
’eighties. An elderly Chinltie storekeeper was down
and nearly out with malignant colitis —Australian
dysentery. We (self and dad) tried opium,
ipecacuanha, chalk, castor-oil and painkiller, with
no effect. Then Chipkie’s mate up and spoke.
“Missie Docktah. Him fay’ him die —all-li’, him
die. Him say him gettee well —all li’, him gettee
CONCLUSIVE.
DEPT. BOSS (in argument with employee): “Are you the boss here?”
MERE EMPLOYEE : “No.”
DEPT. BOSS: “Well, what do you leant to talk like a damn fool for?”
well. Missie Docktah no can do ? A’o can do! Me
gettee one piece goanna gaw, give ’im Wun Lung, him
gettee bettah.” It took “Missee Docktah number
two” a long time to catch on —I had not been to
China then. But at last, M.B. No. 2 said: “Atcha!
Can do!” So Wun Lung’s mate made a bolus of
dried iguana’s gall and gave it to the boss Chow.
It did the trick all right. Ox-gall in pill is an
ancient remedy for dysentery.
“Melos”: “Mohovir” (B. 27/9/’l7) i n
listing the world’s venomous snakes, overlooked the
deadliest of all, viz., the rare Feu-de-lance or bush
master, a beautifully-colored 10ft. to 14ft. crawler
of Brazil.
WILLING FOR A FRIENDLY YARN.
NEW BANK MANAGER (thinking of household
arrangements): “Ha, Smith, does your
wife go out washing?”
SMITH ( odd-job man) : “No, she won't take
it on. Does yours?”
W. H. Cuming, of Strathalbyn (S.A.).
has found the one perfect bait for foxes—
a rosella parrot. Dogs won’t pick it up,
but it is tbe one table delicacy no fox can
resist; so there you are. “When laying baits
put them close to a sheep or cattle path, or any old
road through a paddock. Place all meat baits one
inch under the ground; if parrots, cover over with
bark, leaves, or grass, to hide from night-birds.
When a bait is missed, if in hilly country, always
look to the higher land, above where the bait was
laid, and the dead fox is mostly found. If on the
plains, search along the path or road. Along the
banks of creeks is a good place to put them. Do
not be afraid of using too much poison; if too little
is used the fox will get away and will not be found,
and the skin will be lost. Put as much strychnine
as will lie on a 3d. piece in each bait. Always put
baits out six weeks before the lambing starts. Keep
putting some out every week up to and through the
lambing season, and a few all the year round.” The
veteran adds that, after 40 years of fighting vermin,
first the dingo, then the rabbit, and now the fox,
he holds that the last-named “is going to be muc
worse to contend with than either dingo or rabbit.

No toil too hard for him
From dawn to twilight dim ;
Long rides in blazing suns,
Long days in whirling dust,
The pride of western runs
His constant care and trust.
Flood-circled sheep to shift,
Scrub-cutting camps to move;
The old slow wheels to lift
Along the daily groove ;
No toil for him too hard
At dip or drafting yard.
Fierce labor at the dams,
Blind days of marking lambs,
Long hours outside the shed
Where kelpies dart and bark
To keep the penners fed
From first run on to dark.
Strong will and ready hands
To force his just demands,
Built on the Western plan,
A brave, strong, silent man—
The man all nations need
To labor and to lead.
What doubt but he would go,
What doubt but do his best,
And face his new fierce foe
As once he faced the West!
No fate too big for him,
The Darling’s pride—old Jim.

MACHINERY THAT SATISFIES
Shearing Machinery
satisfies the Station-owner —it satisfies the Agent who sells
it, and satisfies the Shearers. They all praise the Cooper
produet. It is sound in construction —trouble proof —low
in cost o : upkeep —and will last for years. It speaks for
itself wherever installed.
5/10/1917. —JAMES LONEBAGAM LTD. state:—“The Cooper Shearing Machinery,
which we distribute through our Mudgee, Gulgong and Dunedoo Stores, is one of the
most satisfactory lines we have ever handled. It always pleases and makes for us
satisfied customers.”
5/10/1817.—Mr. LEWIS BELL. BOOLIGAL. N.S.W., states: —“The 12 stands of
Cooper Improved Belt-driven machines and lOh.p. Cooper oil engine ran through the
shearing to our complete satisfaction in every way.”
15/10/1817.—Mr. R. CORBY, Sen., JUNCTION POINT, via CROOK WELL, says:
“After seeing several Cooper plants shearing in the Crookwell district during the past
two seasons, we want similar plants for our sheds. Both my son and I want
complete outfit of machines and engine like those installed by Mr. Mclntosh and
others of our district some time ago.”
29/9/1917. —“THE KADINA AND WALLAROO TIMES,” SOUTH AUSTRALIA,
states:—“The Cooper Engineering Co. hold an enviable record for their Sheep Shearing
Machinery. The Representative of this Journal paid a special visit to the homestead
of Mr. J. T. Chapman, Roachfield, on Tuesday, to see a 6-stand plant of these machines
working. They are the acme of strength and reliability, and well indeed do they
merit the hall-mark of ‘the best.’ ”
10/10/1917.—Messrs. R, C.' & A. N. EATON, CUNDERDIN. W.A.. write:—“We have
great pleasure in informing you that we have purchased through your Agent one of
the ‘Little Wonder’ shearing plants. It gives ns every satisfaction. W’e have not
the slightest trouble with the engine, and the shearing plant works like a good 8-day
clock.”
Over one thousand Conner “Little Wonder” 2-stand nortable outfits, as illustrated in the above right-
hand corner are working every season throughout Australia, some for more than twelve years. Large

“Satin Bird”: Pass your plate and have
another eagle. This one was shot ’near Timbarra
(N.S.AV.). It measured from tip to tip of wings
exactly 12 feet.
THE POINT OF VIEW.
VISITOR (absorbed in the cocky's niece from town): “ Bonzer, isn't she?"
COCKY: “ Ain't she! Refused twenty quid for her only last week."
“Uckle”: Now that the 12 bush Melbas
have been before the footlights, I’d like to stage
another turn. Which six birds have the most mourn-
ful, depressing and nerve-racking cries? 1 nominate,
first, the curlew, whose blood-curdling shriek, fol-
lowed quickly by an agonising sob, thrice repeated,
has on a dark night made many a game man go
sour on things in general. Next the crow. Ilis
sinister “Caw, caw!” as he licks his chops after
gouging out the eyes of a ewe, or his
sharp cry to his mates as he sights another
victim, gives me the pip. Third, the mopoke.
The melancholy, persistent call throughout the
night is enough to give even a hardened bush-
man the jim-jams. Fourth, the plover. Ever hear
a mob of them screeching of ghosts and murder on
a moonlight night ? Fifth, the owl. Toot, toot!
Toot toot! You imagine Gabriel blowing his horn,
and you not ready to face the Bench. Sixth, the
hawk (any variety). His squeak spell- danger and
death to many of our sweet bush singers and
to the smaller frisking animals. And so he
should get a place with the Kathleen Mavourneens
also. If any Abo. has something worse than those
to nominate, for Heaven’s sake ask him to keep it
out of the Ma State’s Central West.
“Myall” : One of the cleverest house-build-
ers of our bush birds is the yellow-tailed tit-warbler,
lie constructs a covered nest of dry grass, string and
feathers, woven together, and the whole he attaches
to a rosebush or shrub or larger bird’s nest, especi-
ally the last-mentioned. I have seen little yellow-
tails’ homes pinned to the nests of wedge-tailed
eagles, whistling eagles, magpies and babblers. Sev-
eral of our smaller birds have this habit. The
spotted-sided finch (diamond sparrow) frequently
builds directly under the babblers’ stick nest. On
the top of his nest proper yellow-tail makes a
second nest, an open one. I wonder why. Is it to
deceive the cuckoo, who seems to have a particular
liking for yellow-tails’ lean-to as an incubator ?
“The Wanderer”: Re “spine” of death-
adder (“Quan,” B. 4/10/’l7). Y’ears ago the late
Robert Forrester, then residing on the Ivurrajong,
Hawkesbury district, fell foul of one Bray (I think),
who kept a snake emporium in Sydney. Forrester
contended that death-adders didn’t bite, but stung.
Bray challenged him to produce his evidence. Bob
set to work and caught some beauties, and an exhi-
bition was arranged in a hall at Richmond.
Bray handled the adders and proved conclusively
that the spine is devoid of sting. Two young goats
were selected. One was bitten by an adder, the
other was*, “stung” to the satisfaction of Forrester.
The kid that bitten was waiting for the hearse
in a few minutes, the other is probably still poking
about the liurrajong.
“Square Axe” : “V.’s” blue-bottle tick and
his bush tick (B. 13/9/’l7) are one and the same
insect. It has a grip like the Hun’s on Belgium
when it first takes hold, but eventually falls off—
literally “full as a tick.” It is deadly to dogs unless
they re tick-proof, and it must have killed scores of
thousands of other domestic animals —cats, pigs, and
even young foals and calves. I know of two cases
where it accounted for infants. In one the tick
was found in the ear and in the other in the navel.
Symptoms: Staggering gait, fits of shivering, paraly-
sis of the hindquarters. Treatment: Sulphur rolled
in fat and made into pills about the size of marble-.
Drop four or five down the affected animal's throat.
Repeat the dose three or four hours afterwards, and
follow with a dose of oil. Never knew this to fail,
even in the worst eases. There may be other remedies,
but a clever M.D. friend failed to find one, and had
to watch his dog die. After a couple of attacks
animals become immune. Ticks are at their worst
on the N. S. Wales North Coast in October and
November. There are four varieties, the smallest
being the size of hen-lice, but only the pest men-
tioned by “V.” causes death.
“Cherokee” : Talking of birds' queer-nest-
ing-places, two wrens recently built in a filmy gar-
ment on a shelf in C. J. Dennis’s house at Toolangi
(lie.). True to his ethics, the Sentimental Bloke
forbore to disturb the honeymoon of blue-capped
Bill and his little brown Doreen, who continued their
cooing unmolested. But here’s a sadder tale. Two
wrens nested and began to rear their brood on the
ledge of a well outside the house of stationmaster
Hurley, at Great Western (Vie.). A heavy wind
blew nest and nestlings into the water. The parents
managed to bring the young birds to the ledge, but
not before they were drowned. Later the parent
wrens were found floating in the water, dead. Was
it suicide?
“Coolibah”: I’ve come across many varie-
ties of spiders’ web while in search of suitable web
for theodolite diaphragms, and have marvelled at
the strength of some of them. I once found a blue
wren entangled in a net, quite exhausted as a result
of his efforts to get free. IT eb that has been spun
for more than two days is too dirty and irregular
for use in surveying instruments, and surveyors re-
placing diaphragm lines usually prefer to first secure
a spider about twice the size of an ordinary house
fly, and by twirling him round on a forked stick for
a few seconds, get him seasick, and he drops on the
end of the thread to the ground, while a yard or so
of clean fresh thread is wound up as he goes. I
have heard of a web thus used that saw 15 years’
service. My own experience is that they last about
five years.
“W.H.R.”: Pass the word to “Leo Lear.”
who complained that he had met the small rock-
wallaby only in the N.E. gorges of Victoria, that he
can shake hands with him often in the gullies near
the junction of the Warrengamba and Nepean rivers,
about nine miles from Penrith (N.S.W.). The little
chap is inclined to be friendly, which, of course,
makes him a “good thing” for the holiday sports-
man. Unlike the swamp and other varieties of his
kind, the rock’s colors do not harmonise with his
surroundings, and he is always visible on the face
of a cliff. His fur is of small commercial value,
and he should be allowed to live in peace, as ho is
one of the most beautiful of our bush friends.
* * * *
“Hippogriff”: As previously remarked.
Billjim overseas talks a jargon of every language
with which he comes in contact. At Fleurbaix, a
walnut was up for Orderly Room, charged with plain
drunk, and his major, known among all the gunners
ns “Bert-ay,” sat in judgment. Bert-av inquired
whether Billjim pleaded guilty. “Oh, ok/,” said
that wight. “Ah-hah ! Fourteen days C. 8., number
two. Compree ?” responded Bert-ay. That worked
out at about seven days for the blot to and seven for
being a French scholar.
* * * *
“Wandi” : After a few hours in a Queens-
land scrub one has to take a careful inventory of
himself. Apart from leeches, which fasten, on to legs
and ankles, a battler often finds himself the host of
the bottle-tick and the cudgera. The first bores into
his anatomy and into that of his dog, some-
times proving fatal to the latter. The beast
(not the dog) must not be pulled out, but
cut at the neck, leaving the head embedded
in the skin. The force necessary to pull the bottle-o
out with thumb and finger squeezes the virus into the
wound, and poisoning ensues. Nipping it off at the
neck prevents that, and the head soon afterwards
falls out. An application of turpentine prevents
itching and inflammation. The cudgera is a minute
pest, which attacks in numbers to make up for its
smallness. When a hundred or so have fastened on
to one’s body, especially between the shoulders, pick-,
ing them off is a tedious process, unless you've got
a mate to do the job for you.
* * * *
“E.S.S.” : If there’s a prize offering for
the largest ants’ nest, give it to the red-jumper, or
soldier-ant. I saw. the winner on the bank of the
Hogontbulla, Southern Queensland. It measured
27ft. long and 12ft. wide. As the spot is on a main
stock route, scores of others doubtless know the
residence. Red-jumper favors gravelly and low-
ridgy country, and though the nest may be under a
tree you will never see on it a leaf or twig, unless
one has just fallen, and then the vigilance committee
will be busy removing it. The mass of litter that
bestrews the ground around indicates the amount of
labor required to keep the premises tidy, especially
as some hefty sticks must lodge on the roof
occasionally.
“Chink”: No list to (late has given a
chance to the most joyous Australian songster of
them all—the rufous-breasted whistler. Other notable
absentees are the singing theater of Southern
Queensland, and the silvereye of Australia generally
Beyond all doubt, the gipsy melodies of the rufous
whistler, grey butcher-bird, grey thrush, reed-warbler
magpie, bush lark, singing flyeater and silvereve
are the happiest bird-songs this continent possesses.
Incidentally, the lists supplied by “Bunvip" al „i
“Hay" (B. 13/9/’l7) emphasise the howling neces-
sity which exists for the straightening out of our
bird-nomenclature. The bellicose “Bunvip” is here-
in- informed that this bit of the earth doesn't lav
claim to a “brown cuckoo,” a “blue thrush,” or a
“white-throated flycatcher” ; also, that the ground-
lark (? pipit) isn't a vocalist at all. The case of
“Hay” is worse. His chatter anont the “Australian
nightingale,” “Australian goldfinch,” “Australian
skylark,” “.wood-dove,” and “native canary” shows
that he has a bad attack of the pernicious and stupid
Habit of making good Australian birds appear
second editions of old-world forms; while his claim
that the wattle-bird (which he carelessly calls a
leatherhead) is a songster proves him to be a mighty
poor judge of the difference between a melody and a
Ilughes-like cackle. Moreover, this planet hasn’t
one cuckoo with anything more than a pleasant call.
These urban appraisers of our bush-birds need educat-
ing or repressing.
“Jimmie Pannikin” : “C. j.W.” is right,
and “Scrubthumper” is wrong—the brolga's voice is
very much louder and carries much farther than
the vocal sounds of either the curlew or the kooka-
burra. During my nature-study days beyond the
Back-o'-Sunset, l often heard the brolga howling so
far off that the distance would have silenced the
curlew’s wildest pessimism or the kookaburra’s loud-
est optimism. By the way, “C.J.TV.” is hereby
informed that the curlew does not “cackle.”

“Jwosp” : In making pictures there is an
awful waste of film. For Margaret Mayo’s
“Polly of the Circus,” with Mae Marsh as
lead, the Goldwyn people used 80,000 ft. to
get 7000 ft. on to the screen. There were
1164 scenes and, on average, they were
taken five times. Chap’.in confesses that he
exposes 100,000 ft. of film in order to reveal
2000 ft. of farce; and luce and Griffith, in
their palmy Triangle days, used up well over
50,000 ft. to get 5000 ft. for their weekly
show.
From London: —
Australia ought soon to get hold of the wittiest
thing now showing on the London stage —a render-
ing in four different conventional ways of one old
idea, a mother calling in a middle-aged friend to
save the son from a supposed adventuress. It is
treated thus: (1) The George Alexander or draw-
ing-room style, full of epigrams, real or faked,
without much action. (2) The modern Aankee
style, all slang and revolvers, the son turning out
at the finish to be a worse crook than the girl he
is to be saved from. (3) Repertory Theatre style,
the scene in a Lancashire parlor, with all characters
insisting on telling the story of their lives at great
length. (4) British melodrama style, on the deck
of a battleship, the supposed adventuress turning
out to be grand-daughter of the friendly admiral, and
the guns of the fleet firing a salute at the end in
honor of the young people’s engagement. The skit
is part of the “Bubbly” revue, but has no real
connection with it, and could readily be detached
for Australian use.
“Floater”: Young George Thorne, who
found jobs suitable to his physique under
the J. C. Williamson and other banners in
Australia, is now a private in the Canadian
A.S.C., and has become an enlargement of
his former self. He left Australia for
America some months back and almost im-
mediately secured a place in Margaret
Anglin’s Co., playing in “The Taming of
the Shrew” in Chicago. Later he appeared
with the same lady in Wilde’s “Woman of
No Importance” in New York, and has been
promised a place in the co. when he has
finished the war.
“Bab Cilbup” : About time that the Firm
gave an evening’s entertainment for the price
of admission. “Baby Mine,” at Sydney Cri-
terion, excluding intervals, occupies about
If hours. At the price of a reserved stalls
seat, this works out, roughly, at three farth-
ings per minute,
Lestoeq, the old actor, reminiscing about
Tree, says that the latterly much-imitated
player first made a name as an imitator
himself. He went on the professional
stage in February, ’7B. Before that. “Our
Boys” had been running for nearly four
years on end, and “Mr. Tree Beerbohm,” as
he then was, used to come “behind” at the
imitations of themselves.
“Stargazer”: The success of Dad ana
Gran’dad Rudd is of value to local play-
wrights, in giving a hint of what the public
wants when it says Australian plays, itie
gteele Rudd th i ngs onlv I)ret end to be plays
SQ far ay to pU)V j de a plausible excuse for
putting certain sets of pronounced Aus-
tralian characters upon the stage, and group-
ing them as speedily as possible into comedy
oddments, with more than a spice ot raw
human nature in them. This is what (nan -
dad Rudd does; it is what 0n Gur Belec
tion” does ; and when either contiapt on
ceases to douthat for afoment it is utteH*

incidents of the play. But it is hard on a
young actress to expect her to so force her

breaking heart at beholding the sad change
j n the appearance of a dy 7 ing boy who is only
a girl in knee-breeches. Given a stage-lover
of the right sex and appearance, she might
work herself up to the point of almost
believing in the situation. But she can t
easily shed tears over the imaginary end ot
her entirely bogus flirtation with another
bit of muslin. She s worse off than the pan-
tomime boy who has to say: ’Nevermind,

nosed Dame. The Dame is at least a man.

“Warwick"’: The “loyalist'" wharf-laborers
have made a new tradition on the Sydney
waterfront. Our concern had 400 cases of
mixed cargo on a certain oversea steamer,
and we had not a single claim for pillage—
the first time for years. Four thousand tons
of cargo were landed altogether, and ss.
would cover the pillage; it would be nfearly
as many hundreds of pounds under old con-
ditions. If this tradition can be carried on
the strike will soon pay for itself.

Australia’s one and only date-farm used
to be at Lake Harry, up Oodnadatta
way, where the S.A. Government planted
the palms, from Algeria and elsewhere, in
what it reckoned to be pretty close to their
native conditions. The trees did passably
and produced some very fair fruit
but it was thought that they W eiv
too far out of the way, and those that would
stand it were shifted a year or two ago to
the lower Murray, where, according to
Forest Conservator Gill, they look like doins
well. s
At the Broken Hill Prop.’s iron-ore
quarries in S. Aus. truckfillers used to be
on day wages, getting from 10s. to 12s a
shift, and they strongly objected to piece-
work. But the co. got one or two to take
it on and now it is pretty general. The
shovellers’ earnings have nearly doubled in
a lot of cases; two Italians (they work in
pairs) have often lifted 455. between them

“Karaji”: P.M.G. Webster may be correct
in his assertion to The Bulletin that tele-
phone poles are not at present toppling in
the N. S. Wales North Coast district, but
that they have toppled and will continue to
topple is beyond doubt. If he will visit the
Paterson district he will see abundant evi-
dence of the result of his Department’s
policy in regard to timber. One instance of
sticks recently showing signs of deteriora-
tion is along the subsidised line from Allyn-
brook to Eccleston. Webster’s allegation
that leaving a piece of bark on the wood
does not cause decay is received by timber-
men with an incredulous smile. The veriest
tyro in morphology of plant life knows the
effect of that procedure. Let a branch fall
from a tree and within a few weeks some
form of insect life will be installed and will
tunnel into the heart. White-ants soon make
use of such an entrance, through which
moisture, the ever-ready ally of decay, will
also penetrate. The damage would not be so
great were it not that trees at the most sappy
period of life are of the regulation size for
poles. If the Department desires to save
money, let it abandon the system of having
a fixed diameter, or, if that cannot be done,
let a diameter of wood clear of sap be fixed.
The P.M.G. says that the slice of bark is
left on to assist identification. The raw-
est recruit to botanical studies knows that
the bark as a means of identification is. as
a rule, valueless. Get turpentine, stringy-
bark and mahogany, and snig them over the
rough ground that poles often have to trav-
erse from the stump to the depot, aud the
bark is undistinguishable. Pass to the
smooth-bark gums and you w 7 ill find that at
certain seasons their bark will not even aid
in establishing the identity of a species. The
recognised method of determining trees is by
fruit and flowers. No work on plant life
suggests the bark.

“E.D.""Died in Melbourne not long ago
a man who was a mystery to many people
who came into casual contact with him —a
tall, well-dressed, grey-faced man who,
though he toiled not neither spun, and
possessed no discoverable property, was yet
ahvays well provided with money and paid
his score with punctilious regularity at a
good hotel. Now that the mysterious per-
sonage is gone, the source of his income may
be disclosed. The man was a mascotte. It
was said that all men with whom he had
associated prospered amazingly, while he
himself remained consistently unfortunate.
The Victorian men who owed their success to
their connection with the luek-bringer num-
ber at least a score, and seven of them
were so convinced of the virtue of the mas-
cotte in their own cases that they clubbed
together and nrovided him with a comfort-
able income to die on.

“Mellish Iteef’’: The cargo-pilfering dis-
ease is spreading. Around the Solomon
Islands the Burns'-Philp steamer carries 60
“boys” to work the cargo—generally a three
weeks’ job. Keceutly the whole bunch were
arrested, and the beneficial result was that
the head boy was sent along for three years;
11 others got two years each, and little
Willie who squeaked on his Xgela and
Sandal-canal pals, was let down with six
months. As he put it: ‘Ale no get longtime
allee same other boys. Me get six-feller
moon no more.”
* * * ♦
“D.F.” : The waste of Australia’s timber
has been going on since the time of Gover-
nor Phillip or thereabouts, and almost from
the start there has been talk about stopping
the tragedy. On June 21, ISO 3, Governor
King issued a proclamation forbidding the
cutting down, barking, damaging or destroy-
ing of any timber or trees likely to become
fit for shipbuilding, buildings, masts or
mechanical purposes except under proper
authority. Again, on October 4, 1803, King
remarked on the improvident way in which
the first settlers at the Hawkesbury had cut
down the timber along the banks of the river
and the tributary creeks, with the result that
the soil was washed away by floods, aim
forbade the cutting down or destruction, by
barking or otherwise, of any tree or shrub
growing within two rods of the bank of a
river or creek. He gave magistrates P®'' el
to levy a fine of 50s. for each tree or shrub
cut down, the penalty to go to the informal.
There would be some money to be made now-
adays if anyone would reintroduce Gover-
nor King's ideas.

THE WHISPERERS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A whisper makes no echo. This is wise,
Because it would not know its own thin voice;
But whispers full of tender, sweet surprise
Are of all forms of speech my dearest' choice.
The rabbit-oh may shout his loud desire ;
Give me the whisper soft with secret fire.
The long procession passed a-down the street;
The afternoon was full of talk and wheels.
And then the evening came on shimmering feet—
A moving diama spun from many reels.
Vampire and hero and the maid-betrayed
Their usual parts along the pavement played.
But it was George who found me in the train,
Where youth and whiskers in the daily squeeze
.Tombed in the door the beautiful and plain,
Reckless of hats and frills and corns and ease.
I felt his smile an inch above my nose—
A smile of recognition, I suppose.
Half smothered on his waistcoat and his tie,
I felt the caravan begin to shake ;
Afar the engine gave a piteous cry
Of sorrow for the load its wheels must take ;
And as we slid along the homing line
His stalwart fingers lightly closed on mine.
It was not all unpleasant thus to rest,
Crushed by the longing for suburban tea
That stirred to hope in every panting breast
And nerved the wobbling crowd’s uneasy knee.
Was it the voice of George or merely fate
That whispered, “I’ll be round at half-past eight” ?
Suburb by suburb passed with shake and bump—
Dim suburbs with long platforms and much gloom.
At each we paused a little while to dump
Some straggling souls that gave us breath and
room ;
Until at last the general retreat
Sufficed to find my weariness a seat.
George was still upright on his manly boots.
Our separation brought me some regret;
For, ’mid the engine’s shrill victorious hoots,
He hid his smile behind a cigarette.
And thus it was that when we reached our coal
We wandered in the darkness soul from soul.
I could not find him in the hurrying throng;
And it was quite impossible to wait.
But underneath my blouse a silent song
Kept lilting, “I'll be round at half-past eight”
I hurried home. Domestic airs were keen
With wild, sad wailings of “No kerosene!”
The reason of that wail I understood.
Of heedless chance we were the butt and scoff,
Because last week a gas-man, sour and rude,
Had come in wrath to cut the meter off ;
And, till the tide of our finance should turn,
The house held nothing that would shine or burn.
The shops were closed, the candlesticks were bare,
The lamps were empty and our world was dark.
I struck a match to light me up the stair
With one familiar, angry, large remark.
And then I thought again of half-past eight.
And George and gloom and young romance and fate.
The family went out or else to bed.
On bread-and-butter in the angry flare
Of burning paper fitfully I fed.
And told my inmost soul I did not care.
In fact, I felt I could not well' dislike
The general adventure of the strike.
The clock was working, though the house was still.
It struck the hour ; the fateful time was near.
My pulses to the darkness seemed to thrill;
The seconds ticked slow music on my car.
Darkness and silence rapture round me spread ;
I said: “Joy lives, though kerosene be dead.”
That was the reason that when he arrived
I laid a warning finger on his lips.
“Don’t speak,” I said. “The bees of noise have hived,
And honey from the comb of silence drips.”
“Right-oh,” he whispered. “I quite understand.”
And gently squeezed my waist and pinched my hand.
The sofa in the dining-room is old,
With three springs broken and a castor lost ;
Yet in that hour it seemed a throne of gold
And jewel-crusted beyond count and cost.
The silence of his kiss gave no alarm
To the deep quiet of his circling arm.
In charity it is not well or wise
To let the right hand hear the left hand speak.
In that soft silence neither nose nor eyes
Knew what was happening to their lips or cheeks.
And frequent alms of exquisite delight
Two darkened mouths received that wondrous night.
A short half-hour went down the track of time,
And then we heard a boot without the door.
The house-bell broke into a noisy chime ;
Some quick steps sounded on the darkened floor.
“Keep still,” I whispered. “Nobody will come
To break our seance if our mouths are dumb.”
Impervious to terrors and alarms,
I nestled close against his throbbing breast.
He strained me closer in his manly arms
And kissed my lips again with noiseless zest.
And then, his eager hand upon the latch,
George murmured: “Mary dear,” and struck a match.
Yes, it was George who, half an hour late,
Stood in the doorway peering through the gloom.
I started; screamed. This latest tick of fate
Gave the blind staggers to the reeling room.
For, with his arm about me tight and still.
I recognised the brawny form of Bill.
Ah, well! George bought a ring last week for Maud,
Which shows how fickle youthful lovers are.
If the war ends next year we go abroad.
For Bill owns houses and a motor-car.
And I have still no reason to dislike
The general adventure of a strike.

G.E.Electric Irons
It is a conservative estimate that,
in ironing for an average family, a
woman walks seven miles a year
between ironing board and stove.
The G.E. Electric Iron will
save waste effort. It furnishes its
own heat, and STAYS HOT until
the ironing is finished. You don’t
have to leave the ironing board,
and you can work wherever there
is an electrical connection.
Write for particulars.
G.E.Fans
A G.E. Oscillating Fan will
cool your office—concentrate its
breezes if you like, or make
them swing around the room.
If you expect continued activity
and mental alertness through-
out the hot Summer months,
install a G. E. Fan and make
your office comfortable. Why
not put a Fan or two in your
home also? You can enjoy the
same comfort during hours of
rest with equal economy. Your
family deserves it.

IF FOOD DISAGREES DRINK HOT
WATER.
When food lies like lead in the stomach,
and you have that uncomfortable, distended
feeling, it is because of insufficient blood
supply to the stomach, combined with acid
and food fermentation. In such cases try
the plan now followed in many hospitals
and advised by eminent specialists of taking
half a teaspoonful of bisurated magnesia in
half a glass of water as hot as you can com-
fortably drink it. The hot water draws the
blood to the stomach and the bisurated mag-
nesia, as any physician or chemist can tell
you, instantly neutralises the acid and stops
the food fermentation. Try this simple plan
and you will be astonished at the immediate
feeling of relief and comfort that always fol-
lows the restoration of the normal process of
digestion. Rut he sure you ask the chemist
very distinctly for bisurated magnesia, thus ■
avoiding confusion with the sulphates,, oxides
and citrates or bismuth and magnesia mix-
tures, which are often unsuitable. Soldiers
at the Front and travellers who are fre-
quently obliged to take hasty meals poorly
prepared should always take two or three
five-grain tablets of bisurated magnesia after
meals to prevent fermentation and neutralise
the acid.— Advt.

POLITICAL
POINTS
The cable last week supplied a striking
instance of the Hun point of view—the
point that has got to be shifted ere Peace
can be seriously talked of. A Zep. descended
at Bourbonne, in France, and some gen-
darmes collared the crew of the stranded air-
ship. The Huns seemed utterly incapable
of understanding their position :
The Zeppelin officers, on being captured, were
arrogant, and claimed a special regime and rooms
at an hotel. They were considerably distressed
when they were treated as prisoners.
None but Huns can think as Huns think,
even at this advanced stage of the war. If
a Zeppelin ever descends in the heart of
TOO MUCH KAM ARAD.
GIM: “ ’Ullo, wat d'yer ’it 'im for, Bill ?
’E wanted to surrender!”
BILL: “’Struth, I ’ad to—the beggar teas
goin' to kiss me.”
London, among the ruins of a crowded dis-
trict and the fragments of a shattered
population, the commanding officer will say
to the policeman who is keeping back the
mob: “You vill please to understandt dat I
demand all der honors of var, and vill vish
to be treated vith der respegt due to a
shentleman.” Having dropped bombs on
babies, noding vill surbrise him more than
to get a tomato in the eye.
The scarcity of young women who will
help the missus do the washina-up is partly
explained by the newest Sydney factory
figures. Though 64 per cent, of the em-
ployees are males, the young woman is sub-
stantially more numerous than the young
man. Flapper employees under 21 number
12,854; of boys under 21 there are only
9779. No doubt many of the “tarts” marry
and leave the factory at 21 or thereabouts,
while the males stay on and work for them ;
nevertheless since 1910 there has been a
decline of 10,000 males and an increase of
8000 females in the factory population.
Probably the war has influenced the figures;
but that doesn’t make everything all right.
It simply means that one effect of the war
is to make women more effective industri-
ally ; and that isn’t going to improve the
outlook for the young men—Bilijinr and
others. The sooner we get to work on a
tariff which will give us work to do the less
trouble we are going to have presently.
In 1910, on the expiry of “the Braddon
Blot,” the Fisher Government made an
agreement with the State Governments to
pay the latter 255. per head of the popula-
tion out of the Customs and Excise revenue.
Now a nice point has arisen over Billjim
and his 300,000-odd mates. Some States
insist on payment for Billjim, though he is
in foreign places; and the Federal people
•—or some of them —are horrified at the
attempted grab. But there is this to be
said : if the money isn’t paid it will favor
the State with the greatest proportion of
slackers, while penalising a State like
Westralia which, having the greatest pro-
portion of men at the Front, is in most need
of financial assistance.
Three notable figures have disappeared
from Westralia's Leg. Assembly—Frank
1\ ilson, .Tack Scaddan and W. I). Johnson.
W ilson, whose narrow defeat for Sussex was
due largely to ill-health, which hampered his
campaign, will be badly missed at a time
when every ounce of financial ability will
be required to drag the State out of the
mess for which the Scaddan administration
is largely responsible. Scaddan had his
lickings for Canning and Brownhill-Ivanhoe
(his one-time pocket borough) to carry in
lus Albany fight, and the Official Labo'rites
put him last on their ballot-slips with re-
markable unanimity. Johnson’s anti-Con-
scriptionist opinions and overt support of
Adela Pankhurst and Frank Anstey in their
lose-the-vvar tours of the West settled his
hash. The Midland Junction railway, work-
shops have sent a big proportion of their
strength to the Front, and they voted
stiongly for Davies, the Conscriptionist
Laborite, in defiance of the Trades Hall
ticket.
The free University of West-
tralia is just about the best of
them all. A few months ago the
Geological Department ran short
of microscopes for petrological
study. English and German
makes were unprocurable, and
the price of American instru-
ments was prohibitive. Mean-
while the class was growing.
Woolnough (Professor of Geol-
ogy) and F. G. Baker (instru-
ment maker) put their heads
together and conceived an
audacious plan of making a
microscope, which Baker has
now accomplished—all but the
lenses, of which there is a plenti-
ful supply in the Common-
wealth. The finished article,
which is said to be; the first
microscope, manufactured in
Australia, is pronounced by ex-
perts to be quite equal to the
Hun-made kind at present in
use. It is also said to be
slightly cheaper ; but that pro-
bably isn’t true. Anyhow, it is
dead certain that, if there was
competition between the foreign
and the local product, the strong
foreign maker would soon dump
cheap goods in order to knock
the infant local industry out.
Nine times out of ten we can’t
at present produce new goods
as cheaply as the foreigner who
has been at it for years; and therein lies
our claim to Protective duties that really
mean something.
Ihe other day the National machine in
N. S. Wales proceeded to choose a candi-
date for It. A. Price s Assembly seat, and
Dick leece, for 30 years or so general
manager of Australia’s biggest financial con-
cern, was a candidate. He is a bit on the
elderly side; yet there probably isn’t a finan-
cial business in Australia that wouldn’t re-
joice to have him alongside to appeal to.
hor this nomination, however, he wasn’t
even left in after the first round. Party
doesn’t want men who can command the
attention of experts. It wants men who can
command the votes of inexperts; and that
can be done mostly by impudence and volu-
ble bluff. After which we wonder why the
country is misgoverned at great expense.
The last coherent utterance of Ebenezer
Ward, just before he passed over in Perth
Public Hospital, was: “Gentlemen, charge
your glasses and drink to Charles Cameron
IN TOPHET.
LOOK US : "Who are they?”
K NOWUS: "Zeppelin raiders. There is no
bottom to their pit.”
Kingston. I ask this not so much for the
man himself as for his great services to his
country.” How many of the present swarm
of political opportunists will get a similar
compliment?
Some day we may get it out of our heads
that the politician who does something
extra wants to be paid for it in money or
pawnable goods. Lately George Fuller, Act-
ing-Premier of N. S. Wales, did no less than
he should have done, but so much more than
the public has been led to expect from the
politician that at once there was a movement
among the usual influiontial citizens to “re-
cognise his services,” and the
recognition had, of course* to be
“substantial.” When you come to
think of it, it is a poor compli-
ment to pay the politician—it
comes close up to an endorsement
of the idea that the politician is
a sordid creature who looks , for a
money reward for everything. It
would be refreshing if George Fuller, who
wants neither money nor plate to pawn,
taught these people a lesson.
Gov.-General Ferguson rushed over to
Adelaide to have a look at the Town-Plan-
ning Exhibition, but in reality to tell the
town-planners that the country, not the city,
should have first call on their attention
I would repeat and emphasise that, whatever ideal
you are after, it is as necessary for it to be reached
in the country as in the urban districts.... The
amenities, comforts and resources of city life have
to be transplanted into the country townships. This
]s even more important than adding to the expansion
and attractiveness of the already beautiful half-dozen
capital cities; their very growth depends upon the
closer settlement, and more productive use, of the
rast areas of fertile soil. Australia has bitten off an
extra big bit of the world’s surface, and everything
the ability' of the people to develop it
and defend it. Only a large population, and a pre-
ponderatingly large country population, can enable
the people to do either.
Then he begged the idealists not to give all
their attention to public parks while con-
tentedly leaving the mothers of families to
spend long summer days “with only a sheet
of tin between them and the blazing sun.”
The Hobart committee is sick and tired of
T > ai l', a k° u t building ships in Australia.
A. I>. Buyers, a leading engineer who has
devoted a lot of time and trouble to the job,
let off steam the other day and declared that
the authorities, Federal and State, were put-
ting up just the same bluff over this as over
other things. A while ago, he said, the local
committee was called together on allegedly
urgent business. When the members got
together there was no one to represent the
Government or to tell them what the urgent
business was. Another enthusiast, W. Fin-
-lay son, the Devonport shipbuilder, has spent
time and money on the idea, and has made
several trips to Melbourne, but has not yet
been able to get the Prime Minister to leave
nebulous remarks and get down to business.
According to Sydney Telegraph the Hol-
man-I uller Government is entitled to “due
« re ." t 1 f 0 1: having thrown off the Norton
Griffiths incubus.” The truth is that the
disreputable old incubus has been “thrown
off by being bought off. In the statement
of accounts for the year appears the legend

Ivalgoorlie is raging about its share of tile
trans-Australian railway rates. The gold
field is nearly 400 miles from Perth, yet the
fare between Kalgoorlie and (say)’ Mel-
bourne is less by only 10s. first class
and Gs. 6d. second class than that betweeh
Perth and Melbourne. On a mileage basis
the difference should be about 325. and 7
first- and second-class respectively The
excuse is made that gold fielders' will nr
any rate, be relieved of the charge
which they incurred in travelling to
Perth to take the steamer route. This
is not so much an answer as aii insult
to their intelligence. Yet it is the old thing
over again. With one breath we tell the young
man to leave the coastal city and get' back
into the country. With the next we tell
him what a fool he was to do it if he wanted
any consideration to he given to either his
pocket or his feelings.
The “Plimsoll mark” existed in N §
Wales years anterior to the advent of
the member for Derby, Samuel Plimsoll.
1 ndor a General Order of Governor King
dated February 23, 1803, it was notified:—
If on proof it appears that the master of a boat
f Ilawkesbury ltiver] receives more grain than the
vessel ought to take with shfetv, the master shall
make good any quantity he may throw overboard or
otherwise damage, lose the freight of that part ’and
on conviction before two magistrates forfeit £s’ to
the Orphan Fund.

That Flemish corn may grow.
Here where no trampling horsemen
Have spoiled the standing wheat,
The wide fields give their living bread
That Flemish mouths may eat.
Rich cornfields red with poppies,
Low barn and homely byre.
As in the past shall rise to hide
The blackened scars of fire.
O fruitful fields of Flanders!
Prove not the harvest, vain !
The finest hands in all the world
Have helped to sow the grain.

SPORTING
NOTIONS
Mick Sim[?]
[?]
Genuine sporting interest attaches to the
three w.f.a. races on the first day of the- V.R.C.
meeting. In the Maribyrnong Plate there will be
the question whether a 101 b. penalty can stop
Almoner, as it has stopped many a topnotch young-
ster in former years. Almoner is a mo., powerful
eolt than the ordinary flier, and to this writer’s
way of thinking the Maorilander should win the
straight flutter at Flemington almost as easily as he
won the Breeders’ Plate at Randwick. But maybe
some new talent will come to light and beat all the
early birds.
Lanius will run in the Melbourne Stakes if all is
well with his legs on Saturday. Whereby hangs the
question of the odds all round for the Cup. Should
the big English horse get away with the Stakes as
easily as tie has won the only other two races he
has started in this side of the world, Moses will
at once quote him down to 2 to 1, or 7 to 4, for the
coming handicap. On paper there is nothing but
Lavendo with a chance of beating Lanius over 10
furlongs on w.f.a. terms, and Lavendo’s chance is
slender.
As to whether this apparent certainty for the
Stakes will win the Cup, one can only say that his
English record proves him a first-class stayer when
fit, and nobody knows exactly how fit he is these
times. Lanius hasn’t been severely tried over the
Cup distance with his stable companion Chrome, or
tested in public. It isn’t the weight—9st. 31b.—
that will stop him in the long race, if he is to be
stopped at all. Nor is it likely to be the interfer-
ence whereof the man in the street talks so glibly.
Interference was said to be going to settle Carbine of
yore, but it didn’t. Lanius will doubtless get a fair
chance to do the trick if he is his own great self
on the day. The probability of other high-weights
beating him on their merits seems hardly worth
considering. If he fails in the last furlong it will
be because he is not siifi •iently strung up to battle
it out with his tough ft opponents. Chrome, Broken
Glass, Westcourt, Bronzetti, Rael Locin and Polyg-
amist look more dangerous than the others. Chrome’s
pretensions arc lucre solid than even Westeourt’s
or Bronzetti’s, ami if the winner happens to be
aught else than Lanius it probably will be the im-
posing light-weight that ran second for Caulfield Cup.
The Derby looks very like a match between Biplane
and Bronzetti, with Broken Glass, Thrice and Pah
King the most promising -candidates for third. On
the A.J.C. Derby running, to be sure, nothing has a
e’-nnee against Biplane; but it is fair to assume that
L .rizctti has improved considerably within- the past
month. Also history suggests that stamina counts
for more at Flemington than at Randwick, and the
son of Bronzino is a stayer, above all things. Given
heavy going and muggy weather the Caulfield Cup
winner will be worth backing (at the odds) to beat
the more perfect galloping machine. If he can’t
beat Biplane, or at least stretch his neck, the most
enthusiastic friends of Bronzetti can hardly argue
that he is a good thing for Melbourne Cup. Already
he is booked to carry in that event 41b. more than
an ordinary Derby winner's weight. If Biplane can
repeat his Randwick win and Bronzetti is clearly
shown to be only a very second-best three-year-old
over 12 furlongs, there will not be much encourage-
ment to back him to win Melbourne Cup with 7st.
101 b. up. Newhaven, long- ago, carried 7st. 131 b. and
ran away with the two-mile race; but Newhaven
had nothing to beat. Form was singularly poor in
the year when lie, bloomed. And Newhaven was a
ridiculously easy Derby winner, anyhow.
* * * #
“0.1 v.” : A Derby win for Bronzetti would
hardly affect his position in the Melbourne Cup
market. In any ease the son of Bronzino will have to
carry 7st. 101 b., or 41b. more than the regulation
weight for a Derby victor, and 111 b. more than his
burden in the Caulfield Cup. His job is already fixed,
whereas the weight to be carried by his four-year-
old adversary Chrome is still an uncertain quantity.
Chrome’s boy put up 51b. overweight at Caulfield,
and it is impossible to say whether a lighter boy
would not have done just as well with the big, awk-
ward animal, or a heavier one would not have been
worth the mount. Some people of long experience
at the game reckon that the difference between
6|st. and 7Jst. doesn’t matter to a horse as big as
Chrome. The advantage that is lost in putting
up the extra weight is gained, or more than gained,
in the extra strength of the rider. On the other
hand, it seems to stand to reason that a lightweight's
advantage must increase with the length of the
journey, assuming that the small boy retains strength
enough to guide the quadruped. Given a capable
kid to ride him at 6st. 71b. in the two-mile race
at Flemington, clumsy Chrome would look pretty cer-
tain to have his revenge on Bronzetti, anyhow. The
Flemington circuit being a furlong greater than the
Caulfield, and the extra half-mile of the Cup course
being a straight run, a nag needs rather less steering
in the two-mile Cup than in the lj-mile event.
Judged by his respectable, but unimpressive, per-
formance of the other Saturday, small-bov Riley
should be good enough jockey for Chrome, provided
he doesn’t need to “waste” to ride at 51b. more than
the handicap weight. The “wasting” of a lean lad
is waste indeed. Better to put up a small man,
even though he costs a few extra pounds. »
“0.K.” : At time of writing, which is a
fortnight. before Melbourne Cup comes due, the
mighty Lanius is declared by watchful touts to be
“sore as a boil.” Horses' in a general way are
quite fit t before they get sore, and it may be that
the big fellow was a lot more forward in condition
than lie looked when he ran his first race in Aus-
tralia ' four weeks ago. Trainer Bradfield couldn’t
say front experience exactly how much work Lanius
required Ito win'd him up to concert pitch, or how
he ought to look when he was fully wound. He
gave most people the impression— i.e. , the horse
did —that a Jot more galloping would improve him,
but this tale of soreness suggests the possibility of
Lanius having h"l enough when he won the Caulfield
Stakes so -pretiilv. Softness may mean much or
little; but should this noble animal win the Mel-
bourne Stakes next Saturday he will not feel as
sore as his hackers will if he misses the Cup three
days later. Meanwhile the alleged trouble is an inter-
esting subject for conjecture, like the passing ail-
ments of Sasanoff and Shepherd King a year ago.
“Trot”: Randwick running holds out no
sort of encouragement for backing Bronzetti (at a
short price, anyhow) to beat Biplane in V.R.G.
Derby. Nor does the Caulfield Cup win-—unless the
ground happens to be heavy. Bronzetti is a. good
eolt, better, in this writer’s judgment, than Biplane
over a distance. But that he has the condition
necessary to cut down the other volt under Derby
weights is mighty doubtful. Biplane won easily at
Randwick. He is apparently just as well now’. That
the Maorilander would shut up first in an argument
over the last furlong is quite probable, but he is
such a free goer that, the likelihood of any of the
others being speedy enough to worry him into the
ground before Bronzetti can tackle is, on anything
so far revealed, no more than a remote possibility.
Much will depend on the state of the course and the
riding. Given a firm footing and an unrattled pilot,
Biplane ought to win easily.
The imported nags Glad Eye and Sir
Amyas appear to have been substantially backed for
Melbourne Cup, although the book shows. no reasons
for the confidence. Sir Amyas is in at Bst., which is
more than he has earned on his form in England or
his doings in Melbourne. With only 7st. 81b. to
carry he ran pretty well in the Caulfield Cup, but
never looked really dangerous. Glad Eye’s recom-
mendation is in the fact that he finished his poor
record for last season by running second for the
Adelaide Birthday Cup and winning the Alderman
Cup (If mile). Evidently Glad Eye is a com-
paratively better horse over a distance than in a
sprint. But what did he do at Adelaide? Gold
Cuffs gave him 361 b. and a beating in the
Birthday Cup, whilst the third horse, Aides, was
trying to give him 3st. In the Alderman
Cup he carried Bst. and beat a couple of
commoners. Judged by his achievements thus
far the aged Glad Eye ought to start at 33 to 1
for Melbourne Cup, unless all the nags with better
pretensions have gone wrong in the meantime. With
7st. 31b. up he ran fifth for the Perth Cup two years
ago. He lias 7st. 71b. in the Melbourne Cup now.
It is more than the animal has fairly earned.

At Warwick Farm (Sydney) on Saturday
there was money for nearly everything that won,
and the books lost a bit of what they left Randwick
with. Among the winners was Roman Queen, a lady
who had won up country lately but had for a long
time failed to show any of the form she galloped in
when a youngster. Roman Queen is of the Charle-
magne breed, and at two years old was suspected of
being likely to grow into something out of the
ordinary. She started at 3’s on Saturday and showed
an ordinary lot the way home over a mile and a
quarter. Another winner was the juvenile Dick
Meagher, a smart-looking colt that may be heard of.
again. It’s hard to suppress a horse with a name
like that.
SID STIERRIN, Refore, Melbourne

Tickets on the Leger tote at Warwick
Farm (Sydney) on Saturday were reduced to ss.
Inside the price was 10s This page doesn’t think
it would have mattered if they had been available
all round at 2d. After intense labor, modified by
prolonged waits for the next customer, it was dis-
covered at the end of the day that £892 had been
handled. At the ponies (11 races) the turnover
was £1732. At the Gosford meeting a day or two
before the club machined £55 10s. The vast bungle
is panning out just as was expected.
* * * *
At a conference between the A.J.C. Com-
mittee and reps, from racing clubs near to Sydney
it was resolved to grapple with the limitation-oi-
fields trouble. The maximums were fixed thus:
Wyong, 17; Menangle, 20; Kembla Grange, 20;
Gosford, 20. At Rosehill, Moorefield, Warwick Farm
and Canterbury Park if the starters exceed 24 a £2
sweepstake is to be added to the stake. The idea
seems to be that £2 a head will induce horseowners
to agree amongst themselves to a reduction. But
even admitting this method to be right, why not, if
they fail to agree, pay the sweepstake either to
the winning jockey or into a fund, for the relatives
of those who may get killed? That the boys pocket
extra risks is surely no reason why winning owners
should pocket extra money.

“Billy Blue”; Passed out at Moss Vale
(N.S.W.) the other day at 91, Phoebe Rowe, member
of an old Australian family and mother of George
W. S. Rowe, secretary of the Rosehill Racing Club,
and Mrs. C. E. de Mestre, widow of the late Etty
de Mestre. The pioneer of the family was a Thomas
Deane Rowe, solicitor, who arrived in N. S. Wales
in the mid-’twenties. He went on the land. His
only son was George Taylor Rowe, ! -band of
Phoebe and a notable sporting man in f -> ’fifties.
Tt was he who, in 1857, accepted the oh. lieu ;e of
the to take over to J! lbourne
the best bit of N. S. Wales horseflesh for a match
against the Victorian best for £lOOO aside. Row?
went after the purse with his horse Veno, and met
Anthony Green’s Alice Hawthorne."'The match was
run on October 3, 1857, and Veno wbn, ridden by
old-time jockey Johnny Iliggerson. :?>
That test match, which created intense excitement,
arose out of the following communication addressed
by Richard Goldsbrough and George Watson (Vic.)
to S. C. Birt (Sydney): “Victoria v. N.S.W.—Victoria
hereby agrees to run a Victorian-bred horse or mare
against a New South Wales horse or jnare, three
miles, over the Melbourne Racecourse, \ ictoria Turf
Club, weight for age.” Then followed 11 conditions
to govern the match. When everything had been
fixed up there was heavy wagering and frequent
toasts were consumed, and the end of it all was a
series of three races, two of three miles and one of
li miles, op the one afternoon. Veno ran in the
longest events and won both. He was an aged geld-
ing, and two days later Rowe sold him for £lOOO.
Imagine the owner of a Sydney champion nowadays
being asked to send the animal to Melbourne and
run it in two three-mile events under welter weights
on the same day 1 *
“Solo”: I saw a man take a double the
other day, Melbourne Cup and Derby—Lanius and
Biplane. ’ He took even money. Has that ever been
beaten ?
* * * *
“Snaffle” : Trotting meetings are going to
be held in Melbourne at night. 1 hough an innova-
tion as far as trotting is concerned, the idea is
not new otherwise. South Yarra .Club used to run
pony meetings by gaslight somewhere in the neigh-
borhood of the present railway bridge. With the
growth of Melbourne this course was swamped and
no race meeting has been held in the city after
sunset for the last 20 years. But that does_ not
mean there have been any fewer dark horses waiting
to come to light.
Vince Blackburn and Sid Godfrey battled
with the fury of 27 roosters and 14 cats at Sydney
Stadium on Saturday for the featherweight cham-
pionship. Twice during the conflict Godfrey dop'o-
sited a wallop on Blackburn which shook him tokihe
heels, and more than twice Godfrey was driven Into
the last line of defence to escape something of the
same sort himself. The affray went to. the bitter
end, whereupon Arthur Scott had to decide whether
Blackburn’s general aggressiveness had been more
scientific than the other party’s opposition thereto.
He decided for Godfrey, whereupon there Were loud
howls of execration. There is a lot of mystery about
this point-accumulating business, but as the writer
saw the thing Godfrey seemed to be doing a bit the
best and he was certainly the stronger of the two
at the termination. But there was little in it one
way or another. So the best thing for Messrs.
Blackburn and Godfrey to do is to resume pushing
one another in the face at an early date and settle
the matter before calling on Scott to employ his
arithmetic.
The boxing game is getting fairly lean in
the U.S.A. these times, but that has not prevented
Jess Willard asking £lO,OOO for defending the
heavyweight title. And as neither Willard nor any
possible opponent has serious claims to be considered
more than third-rate, it looks as if the price of dope
is keeping pace with the cost of food.
The early rush of century-makers in Syd-
ney first-grade cricket suggests that the bowlers
ought to get up early and practise. With only two
rounds gone there are already eight three-figure scores
on the book. The bright spot in the round just ended
was L. Donovan’s 12 wickets for 65 for ’Varsity
against Sydney (last year’s premiers). Donovan
made his debut in first-grade cricket last .year by
taking 33 wickets (average 20.72) and scoring 337
runs (av. 22.46). As a set-off some of the first-
flighters caught it hot in the just-ended round —among
them Arthur Mailey (five for 124), W. S. Dight
(four for 139), and W. S. Folkard (four for 84).
Noble, playing for Paddington against
Middle Harbor in the second round of Sydney’s first-
grade cricket, hit up 87 in quick time, including
six sixers. Thousands who used to grow frantic
while the Australian captain painfully amassed his
test-match scores will wish he had got into the habit
of hittin’ ’em up a bit earlier in life.
Harry Trott, the old-time skipper of Aus-
tralian Elevens, is in a bad way again, physically
and otherwise. A fund to help him over the stile
has been opened at Melbourne, and any Bulletin
reader who feels like handing out a bit can send it
to E. E. Bean, secretary of the V.C.A., who will
attend to the rest.
* * * *
“Mynn” : The death of Major Ben Warclill
recalls his brother Dick, at one time secretary of the
Melbourne Cricket Club and The first batsman to
score a century in first-class cricket in Australia.
That was when he made 110 against Ma in ’67. Two
years later Joe Phillips hit up 115 for Vic. against
Tassy, and Gordon scored the third century, 121
against N.S.W. in ’7O. It was not until ’B2 that a
century was made for N.S.W. against Vie., and then
Billy Murdoch burst out with his famous 321, Tom
Garrett making 163 and Sammy Jones 109 in the
same innings. Dick Wardill treated most bowling
with disrespect. In eight completed innings he
averaged 35 against N.S.W. —great figures for those
days. ITe died away back in ’73.
One of tlie two Morrice Williams brothers
in the Billjim Officers’ List, Charles, has gone West
a few months after winning the Military Cross,
leaving his younger brother Clive to represent the
family. Both came from Melbourne Grammar—
sons of Oliver Morrice Williams, general manager
of the London Bank, deputy chairman of the Re-
patriation Fund, and until recently president of the
Vic. Football League. Charles Was wounded in
Gallipoli and France, and was twice in despatches.
Thirty-six years of age, he had risen to captain
when the end came on October 9. He was a noted
cricketer and oarsman.

Lieut. Billy Hogg, of a Vic. battalion,
dead of wounds received in front of Polygon Wood,
was a rare athlete —footballer, swimmer, golfer and
yachtsman. He was one of the three chosen to sail
the Rip and bring the Northcote Cup back to Vic-
toria. Three brothers still wear stars at the Front;
and the baby of the fine family, a gunner, was killed
last December.
Passed out iu the big strafe, young
Captain Fred Gore Moule, son of Arthur Moule, of
the Melbourne legal firm of Moule, Hamilton and
Kiddle. Freddie was on Dalgety’s staff, and was
much loved by his comrades. A good athlete, he was
the mainstay of St. Kilda cricket team, and played
m inter-State matches; and he rowed in Melbourne
Grammar crew. His chums will sorelv miss the
cheery lad.

Vic. Public Schoolboys brought off several
flat races at the Melbourne Cricket Ground last
week, and despite a heavy and. cut-up track, scored
a couple of high-grade runs. A. N. L. Patten of
Wesley, won the quarter in perhaps the brainiest
style ever registered at these gatherings, in 54sec
with four yards to spare from T. A. S. Jackson
(Geelong Grammar). W. E. Macmillan (Geelong
College) ran a clipping mile, in front all the wav-
in 4min. 45 4-ssec., finishing strongly 30 yards ahead
of L. R. Richardson (Geelong Grammar). tv.
Winter-Irving (Melb. Grammar) accounted for the 120
hurdles, and E. V. Gross (Geelong College) for the
100 yards in six yards worse. In the half-mile
.Macmillan added another meritorious win to his
middle and distance captures. He is the sort
that will make an Australasian champion like
Russell Watson, provided he sticks to the game
and doesn’t go growing wheat or doing something else
useful. In the 220 J. C. San Miguel finished first
from schoolmate Sullivan (Xavier’s) in 23 l-ssee.,
after cutting in on his field. It was the only blot
on the day’s events. Starter “Stoi'key” Adams had
his runners well in hand and stood for “no break-
ing,” a lesson he dealt out last year.

Fred Jennings, who at 54 claims the “old
age walking championship of Australia,” last month
padded the hoof from Orange to Bathurst (37 miles)
in 6hr. 57min. 24sec., and thereby clipped 6sec. off
his own five-yea rs-old record. Over the last mile he
pushed a wheelbarrow in 13min. 34sec., which is
also alleged to be something to iheer about because
if is 26sec. better than a crank effort of King, the
“Flying Pieman,” over half a century ago. Other
freak efforts of the “Pieman” which still hold good
include “working incessantly six days and nights”
(that looks safe, at any rate), and “carrying a goat
pick-a-back from Sydney to Parramatta” (there’s a
train for such purposes nowadays). When the poor
old “Pieman” died in Liverpool (N.S.W.) Asylum
his “records” went with him, only to be resurrected
to flavor a joke performance.
Bowling is a fairly “wet” sport at a good
many places, but Albury is the limit. They were to
open the green at a recent week-end, but the river
came down in the biggest flood ever known in those
parts and filled it to the brim with a couple of feet of
water and carried in an odd fish or two as well.

Calox efficiency.
Calox, when moistened, liberates oxygen
-—and this wonderful purifying agent
rapidly spreads into every tiny crevice,
and the whole mouth undergoes a com-
plete disinfection.
The acid secretions are neutralised,
germs and bacteria are destroyed. The
oxygen acts thoroughly on the unseen
parts where dangers usually lurk.
Calox removes discoloration and speedily
induces a lasting brilliancy. It
recognised also as the most charmini
and refreshing dentifrice of all.

Put on a Roof
That Defies Sparks
Why take chances with an inflammable roof when we can
supply a roofing that insurance companies regard as “ equal
to tin, slate or tile” in fire-resisting qualities. This roofing is
Pronounced "RLTas In RUBY .
Hu-BER-on
COSTS_MORE-WEARS LONGER
In a rectent test “Piles of wood
shavings and sawdust, saturated
with gasoline, were burned for
19 minutes—until consumed—
on the surface of RIJ-BER-OIQ
Roofing. At the end of this time
the embers were removed and it
was found that the roofing was
blistered but still intact.”
RU-Ber-010 contains no coal tar,
asphaltum oils, wood fibre, paper,
or other inflammable substances.
It costs much less than either tin,
slate or tile.
RU-BER-OIQ Roofs laid more than
20 years ago are still watertight
and apparently as good as new.
No other prepared roofing has this
record. Our customers who have
used £U-BER-OIQ never have to
worry over leaks or repair bills.
Come in and let U 3 show you this
good roofing. We have it in attrac-
tive slate gray and in beautiful

“Adelaide”: The most persistent example
of devotion to the drama comes from an
Adelaide theatre. When the house was built
the owner of the land secured the light to
seats at any show. He has been dead some
time now; but still, almost any evening of
the week, in comes liis card, neatly endorsed
“Please admit to my seats.”
Played his last card at Dunedin, Captain
F. J. Easther, R.N. In the Maori disturb-
ances he fought with the Navy section, and
in later years was on the staff of the Union
Steam Ship Co. The fighting spirit is
passed on to his only son, Lieut. Tom
Easther, once of Dalgety’s, now of Flan-
ders.
Some months ago an enterprising Vic.
spinster risked a matrimonial ad. for a
“lonely soldier”—-and got one. Arthur Albert
Edward John Roberts, aged 40, married the
lady. He was a soldier suffering from loneli-
ness at the time, and the fact that he had
married another girl two years previously
had slipped his memory. Perhaps at the
time she was pining, too. Really, ought a
man to be punished for responding to the
tenderly-worded cry of a lady in distress?
A resident of Bondi before Bondi was
part of Sydney died last week —Mrs. Mary
Anne Mackenzie, who had got beyond her
87th year. She came to N. S. Wales in
the ’fifties, after a spell in Victoria, and
grounded at Bondi, her husband, Alexander
Kenneth Mackenzie, setting up as a “gentle-
man dairy-farmer.” There were about three
others residing in the district at the time—-
including Francis O’Brien, who had a pri-
vate cemetery, which was the subject of
litigation years afterwards. Mr. Mackenzie
was killed in a coach accident at Port
Macquarie So years ago. A son was for
24 years manager of the Perpetual Trustee
Co.
The wretched Freetrade papers have a lot
to answer for. After the very earliest days,
and before these papers had got in their
work of destruction, the prevailing idea was
that almost anything could be done in this
wonderful country. And an amazing num-
ber of things were done. When Charles
Darwin visited Hobart in 1830 he was taken
aback, as lie says in his “Journal of Re-
searches.” to find that there were two steam-
boats, then quite a new invention, running
on the Derwent, and that the machinery of
one of them had been entirely manufactured
ir. Hobart, then but 33 years old.
The Hun who is on wings in the big
spaces of Palestine is a bit above the rest of
his kind, according to the experience of
Lieut. Vautin, a Hobart flying-man. He
was brought down in Canaan by a German
aviator named Felmy, vdio soon afterwards
dropped the following letter over the British
lines, along with some snapshots:—
For the friends of Mr. Vautin. I send vou our
photograph. Mr Vautin has himself wellfeelt. He
is a very kindly man, and of course a gentleman.
Vesterday I showed to him Jerusalem. In the next
few dais I will write to his father and send to him
our photograph. \\ e hope tii.it you will dropp soon
the things for Mr. Vautin. With sportly salutations.
There is something significant in that
“sportly.” It looks as though, in Germany
as in England, the war-god hasn't yet got
control of the air. He has called the
sportsman in to help him there —that sports-
man whom the German military autocrat
always professed to despise.
Camberwell (Vic.) Municipal Council was
lately informed by tlie Board of Health that
a certain nuisance was being committed
within its boundaries, and that the Council
should prosecute the offenders. With an
air of indignant surprise the Council with-
drew its head from the mayoral cupboard
long enough to remark that, as the Board
had discovered the horror, it could do its
own prosecuting. At latest the Board was
condemning the Camberwell body as “a dis-
grace to local government,” and suggesting
that the Government should abolish the
Council if it can’t be prevailed on to stick
to its job. The trouble is that the council-
lors are much more concerned about sticking
to their seats. The nuisance is notoriously
common ; but the Camberwell market-gar-
deners who are responsible for the filthiness
are ratepayers, with votes. So there is a
scandal in the Council as well as in the
market gardens. The remedy is, not to abol-
ish the Council, but to deprive these vicious
ratepayers of the municipal vote. They are
plainly not to be trusted with it.
“Frank R.” from the eentre:—
Oodnadatta is at the end of the railway which pokes
north towards Darwin. It is 500 miles from Adelaide
and seems 50,000. The “town” consists of a few hot
and dusty tin-roofed shanties. But there is plenty
of space around. I never felt how big Australia was
till I landed at Oodnadatta, where 50 miles awav
is just next door. They speak slightingly of any-
thing up to 500. Over that you can talk.' I found
at once that they do not set great store on missions,
and a mission was my job. “They’re for the women
and kids,” I was told; and there are not many
women and kids there. The heat killed most of my
attempts at services, so I decided to hold them out
of doors. I got two or three people to attend. But
an Arab spoilt it by turning loose a string of donkeys.
The brutes walked right through my congregation on
their way to their uswal watering-place. The con-
gregation grinned—l think it knew what to expect.
The outstanding feature of the man outback is his
superb self-confidence. lie is absolutely self-reliant,
and he hates patronage worse than the Devil I was
there to warn him against. I got rather a take-down
myself one evening when driving east from Broome.
1 was out about 200 miles, and with my blackboy drew
up at a soak where we were to camp for the night.
As I was fishing out the billy, I saw a man groping
his way down to the water. I stared at him for a
while, when it dawned on me that he must be nearly
blind, so I hurried down to help him. I filled hfs
Lilly, and saw that he had a bad dose of ophthalmia
“Anything more I can do?” I asked. Says he “What
won the Caulfield Cup?” It was my turn to feel
very helpless. I didn’t know. That put mv pot on
all right; without another word he turned and
walked away.

Melbourne has its artistic grocer, Ernest
Ratcliff, who has encircled the eastern sub-
urbs with a necklace of drygoods stores. His
villa, tucked away in the wilds of Haw-
thorn, is crammed from parlor to bathroom
with pictures. He has plunged heavily in
Max Meldrum’s cold, grey works. It is said
that one square of pessimism is hung cheerily
over the ice-chest, with excellent results upon
the family blanc-mange.
“Te Whare’s” dead friend:—
J. J. IJilder, that ethereal colorist, did some of
his earliest work about the oak-fringed rivers of
Bega (South Coast N.S.W.), sometimes in company
with the members of a local sketch club. Needless
to say, his work, crude though it then was, far out-
shone the rest: but the praise it invariably won lie
pever appreciated. “Sunrise on Mumbla Mountain”
(a spur of the Coast llange), an- early effort, lost
him many a breakfast. Eventually he got what he
wanted, or partly what he wanted, from an elevated
point above the town, painting for dear life, lest the
pink and red glory should escape him. This gem,
like many others, he gave away. He set no value
whatever on his early work. Occasionally he tramped
out to a hospitable farm-house on the sea-coast, and
while there spent all his time in sketching. His
work done in this quarter includes some delicate
pen-and-inks, reminiscent of the finest woodcuts of
Thomas Bewick, but I think that Wilder made little
use of this medium. There is extant a book-plate
of the finest workmanship of this period. He fre-
quently condensed the views from his boarding-house
windows into delicate color-panels, and gave them
away. About this time a girl friend showed some
of his work to Julian Ashton. The criticism was
caustic but sound. The great promise, afterwards
fulfilled, of Hilder’s early work was obvious. When
the two men met, Hilder’s serious artistic career
began. The bank knew him no more.

Farmers, Feed Your Pigs on Meggitt s Linseed Oil Meal.
TESTIMONY OF SATISFIED FARMERS.
Mr. W. G. ROLLO, Glen Iris, Mullumbimby: “I have procure:! another ton of your Linseed Meal, and am feeding it to my pigs, in conjunction with
skim milk, with splendidly beneficial results. I consider it superior t:> pollard in feeding value, and considerably cheaper.”
Mr. A. McPHEE, Coolah Creek, Cowper, breeder of pedigreed Berkshire pigs, says: ‘‘Send me further six sacks of your Meal, which I am feeding
chiefly to my pigs, mixing it with molasses and water. I think it is a great feed, and easily handled.”
How to Feed Meggitt’s Linseed Oil Meal.
COWS. Leave vour hav ration as it is and give 31b. Linseed Meal and 31b. of bran per day,
soaked or dry.
FOWLS. Hb. Linseed Meal, lib. chaff, lib. bran or pollard per day will feed, morning mash
only, 30 full-grown birds. Soften the chaff in boiling water, pouring off surplus water after allowing
. stand for a few minutes; add the Linseed Meal, which will absorb the remaining moisture, then mix
ln the pollard or bran and make the whole a crumbly mash.
. HORSES. Add 3to 4 lb. per day DRY Meal to their ration of corn and chaff. Commence
gradually by adding a small handful to each meal, slightly moistening the chaff to make the Linseed
stick to it. Gradually increase to full ration as your horses become accustomed to the taste, at the same
time reducing your supply of chaff and corn.
CALVES. About Jib. per head per day. Dissolve Linseed in boiling water and add to skim
milk.
SHEEP. 2oz. per head per dav, in specially nutted form. Can be spread on the ground with-
out waste. For Show Stock double the amount.
PIGS. Linseed Oil Meal and skim milk are an ideal food.
Your Storekeeper will explain why MEGGITT’S is Superior. Fuller particulars on application.

What is Talcum Powder?
TALCUM is an inorganic substance
—neither dampness, heat or perspi-
ration affect it. Rice, starch, and other
vegetable powders are organic— they
are affected by temperature and
moisture —perspiration sours them —
when sour they become a source of
irritation and a breeding place for
infectious germs.
rrermsrrs
Borated Talcum Powder
will not sour or ferment; and, medicated in the proper proportion,
covers baby’s skin with a protective coating against
threatening germs. You use Talcum Powder in
such unlimited quantities on the sensitive skin of
your baby, that the selection of a pure,
safe powder is of great importance.

Already the old members of the Leg. Coun-
cil have taken fright and given notice of
motion of a sessional order to prevent the
House sitting after 9 p.m. The old gentle-
men are terrified at the prospect of having
to stay out of bed to prevent Ryan’s young-
sters of 45 or 50 doing anything naughty.
A six-foot alligator walked up the main
street of Cairns last week, having steered
from the inlet along one of the sewers. It
was promptly accommodated at a neighbor-
ing boarding-house by an enterprising show-
man who happened to be on hand. This is
the second croc, this year to leave the inlet
and inspect the town. Last year a cane-cutter
had an interview with one of the tearful
beasts on a local farm.
The incident of the funeral wreath left on
Premier Ryan’s doorstep has bad police
attention. There wasn’t any difficulty about
picking up clues. Somebody sent Yowles,
M.L.A., the man who made the baseless
Wando Yale charges, a wreath, with the
Premier’s card attached ; and Yowles handed
the joke, with its own card attached, to
ex-Speaker Armstrong, who happens to live
next door to Ryan. If Ryan got hurt in the
end it was simply because a friend of his—
evidently a friend with the run of his card-
case—set out to do some hurting to begin
with. In the circumstances the squealing
about the matter and the frenzied attempts
to make political capital out of it are very
amusing.

Treasurer Theodore is claiming £5OOO
damages from Thomas Francis Connor, a
Central Queensland grazier, in consequence
of certain statements alleged to have been
made bx T defendant about the purchase ot
Wando ‘ Vale by the Government. The
allegation was one of the matters investi-
gated by the recent Commission, which re-
ported that the story was all moonshine.
Another serious effort is being made to
out the priekly-pear. Some time ago, on a
report by Dr. Jean White (now Mrs.
Heaney), who was conducting investigations
at Dulacea, the experimental station there
was closed down, and the Government
offered to hand it over to the Common-
wealth. The Advisory Council of Science
and Industry went into the matter, and
subsequently the Commonwealth Govern-
ment decided to set aside £4OOO a year for
five years for prickly-pear research work if
the Governments of Queensland and N. S.
Wales would each contribute £2OOO a year
and the Queensland Government would hand

been agreed to, and central laboratories are
to be established at Brisbane. Dulacea and

“Hal Dene”: As a brother pressman I
wish the Hon. Randolph Bedford, M.L.C.,
would refrain from addressing the House at
the rate of more than 200 words a minute.
Making an early start, the new member
erupted in such a geyser of invective against
those who raised the sectarian issue that he
had soon passed the 220-word limit.
Treasurer Theodore, till now regarded as the
bane of gallery-men, was beaten by 10 edi-
tions. When the hose was turned off an
emissary of the Gallery waited on Bedford and
broke the news that a Society had been
formed for the Assassination of Someone.
Bedford forthwith made peace proposals by
inviting the emissary to haveadrink, and but-
toned his friend into the members' bar.
When this piece of glaring unconstitoosh’nal-
ism was noticed, a hasty retreat was made.
Ten minutes later Bedford took the framed
set of regulations from the wall and spent an
industrious three minutes.
Our Speech.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Oh, speak to me never in words you use
To other women who please your eyes,
But in the silence when lightning plays
Its lance, low down in the summer skies,
Or at midnight’s hush, when some shrinking
flower
That feared the prying of garish day
Rustles a petal and bares a heart
That is cool as starshine and sweet as
may—
When the rare dream-tremor goes through
your soul
And you feel the thrill that must bring
forth song,
Then the night will carry your speech to me
The happy hills of the world along !
Oh. reach your hand in no bold caress.
For such love-life holds a death within ;
But send me a token I can keep
Oh the long caress of a violin :
Some joy you found in a printed word
That fixed the thought of a poet-brain,
Some major note of a shaft of sun,
Some minor lilt of the friendly rain !
The wind that came from"si mountain top
(But swept a garden of roses through),
Some pine bough sighing in gyves of mist,
Some laugh of leaves in a wash of blue,
The. golden sand in a crashing wave,
The tip of a gannet’s wing of snow,
The fluted lip of a sea-tost shell
That lisps its tale of the green below—
Let These spell softly my answer, hold
My soul’s wild hymn to your music bars.
The sun and wind are our alphabet—
God gave 11s words in His silver stars!
QUEENSLAND.
M. FORREST.
QUEENSLAND GOSSIP.
Brisbane, October 27. 1917.
My Dear Thabgomindaii,—■
A fair, organised by Labor supporters to
raise funds for the next election campaign,
decorated the Domain on Friday and Satur-
day. Mrs. Ryan opened it and the Premier
rattled off a speech. A number of stalls did
big business, amongst them one filled with
brushware, wickerwork, etc., made by mem-
bers of the Blind Advance Association.
About £2OOO profit is expected.
Mrs. Ryan’s committee, which for the past
two years has provided a Christmas enter-
tainment for the children of men on active
service, has amalgamated with the Returned
Soldiers and Sailors’ League to carry on the
good work. The Premier’s missus retains
the position of chairwoman.
We have a Soldiers’ Settlements Pastime
Fund. It provides circulating libraries,
etc., for the settlements. There is only a
small committee, mostly wives of members
of the War Council, and the hat is going
to circulate on Friday to help.
The Musical Bowlers, a private concert
party which moves about giving concerts for
various patriotic funds, had a muster at
St. Mary’s Hall. Kangaroo Point, on Thurs-
day night, in aid of the local branch of the
Red Cross. Fred Collier (a Melbourne
baritone), Lena Hammond, George Kitson,
Gladys Frost and Miss Jeffei’ies were the
headliners.
What will probably be the first free public
library in Australia for children is to be
established here in connection with the
Children’s Playgrounds Association. The
Ithaca Council has granted an area in Lang
Park for the playground, and 50ft. square of
this area is to be xmsted in trustees for the
library. The Round Table, our Theosophical
movement, has donated £2OO towards the
latter.
There are now 50 branches of the Soldiers’
Comforts Fund, an increase of 19 since last
year. Over 790 cases of comforts hax r e
been sent to France during the past 12
months and 240 to Egypt; also there is a
credit balance of £OO7, while the working
expenses for the year were only £l9. Pats on
the back all round.
Killed in France, Capt. Sidney Bond, 22,
only son of Mr. and Mrs. L. M. Bond, and
nephew of L. E. Groom. Assistant-Minister
for Defence. He was an ex-Urammar h ■
and a graduate of Queensland Uni. Yount
as he was the boy had seen service in Esmv
Gallipoli and France.
Another of ours who rests in Prance is
Corporal F. C. Shaw, pastmaster of tit
General Gordon Masonic Lodge, and '
working hours, on the staff of the National
Mutual Insurance office. He served throuel
the Boer War.
The Art Society held its 29th annual ex
hibition this week. A number of southern
artists, including Lister-Lister, Datfiln
Rubbo, J. S. Watkins, C. E. S. Tindall, J i>
Jackson and Harrison B. Harrison sent
canvas. The last-named exhibited an excel
lent portrait of an old lady. Mrs. Muntz
Adams, who is in charge of the Art School'
at the Technical College, has some vivid bits
of landscape and a few fine portraits to her
credit. Bill and Gwendolyn Grant, J. Sal-
vane, Lancaster and P. S. Hobday, ’ local
artists, also deserve attention. The laurel
wreath goes to L. .T. Harvey, whose wood-
carving and sculpture would delight critics
anywhere. One little head has a tremulous
smile on the childish lips which makes it
almost animate.
W. J. Bevington, a veteran State-school
teacher who until recently was secretary to
the East Moreton Teachers’ Association and
secretary to the Departmental Joubnal, was
given some solid proof of goodwill at a
party which the teachers held in his honor
on Wednesday evening.
C. B. Astley, of the Courier literary staff,
and Miss Eileen Lindsay, an East Melbourne
girl whose father once pushed a journalistic
quill, have decided to give a clergyman a job.
Miss Joyce Fullerton, who has been trip-
ping in Britain, is back. While she was in
England she worked in a canteen at Wool-
wich.
Gertrude Johnson, now touring this State
as a prima donna with the reconstructed
Italian Opera Co., is the Melbourne girl who
was just about to go to Europe to get her
voice finished when the war broke out. A
fund raised for the purpose has been accu-
mulating interest for more than three years,
and promises to be a very substantial means
of voice-culture by the time the Kaiser
is knocked out. Miss Johnson got a hearing
from Balboni and others of the new combine
when it was being formed; hence the
engagement. Gilda in “Rigoletto” and
Nedda in “Pagliacci” are her first attempts
in grand opera. Mrs. Johnson is an Austral
Salonite who busies herself in patriotic
work, and Gertrude’s only brother is one of
the earliest Anzacs, still on the job, although
he has been twice invalided.
Sapper Randolph Bedford, jun., of the
Field Engineers, went south last week to
await embarkation after a flying visit to his
people in Brisbane. He goes to Meso-
potamia. Though still only 21 he has seen
much engineering construction during his
articles with Major H. V. Champion, C.K.,
and had a hand in important work in water
supply and tunnelling.
Yours affectionately,
AUSTRALIA JANE.

Genuine Leather
Studebaker bodies are upholstered with genuine leather, and it is of high-
grade quality —the same that you find on cars costing from to 400
more than Studebaker cars.
It is soft, pliable, durable, fast-colored, and it will not work off, scale,
crumble or check. We describe this leather to you because it shows the
quality of material that Studebaker uses in the construction of its car.
Compare Studebaker upholstery throughout with that used in any other
make of car —genuine leather is used in every part of the upholstery —it is not
skimped bv substituting imitations of leather in various parts, as is found in so
many motor-cars to-day.
Expense has not been spared to cheapen the car in any particular. It is
distinctlv a high-grade, fine motor-car. Your comfort, your safety, your pride,
have all been considered in the design and construction of both the FOUR
and SIX. It costs only a little more to obtain the quality that you find in
Studebaker cars, and this quality is the thing that gives you real economy.
“It is better to pay a little bit more and get the BEST."
Equipment includes Electric Self-starter ; spare tyre, tube and rim ; rain
vision wind-screen, and two disappearing armchairs (indispensable in modern
motor-cars).

Simple and Effective Methods.
By Olga Amsdell, Special Correspondent,
London, Eng.
To Kill Roots of Superfluous Hair.
Women annoyed with disfiguring growths
of superfluous hair wish to know not merely
how to temporarily remove the hair, but how
to kill the hair roots permanently. For this
purpose pure powdered pheminol may be
applied directly to the objectionable hair-
growth. The recommended treatment is
designed not only to instantly remove the
hair, but to actually kill the roots so that
the growth will not return. About an ounce
of pheminol, obtainable from the chemist,
should be sufficient.
Removing Her Skin.
The quickest and surest way to make a
good complexion out of a bad one is to
actually remove the thin veil of faded or dis-
colored outer skiu from the face. This can
be done easily, safely and privately by any
woman. The process is one of gentle absorp-
tion.
Get some pure mercolised wax from your
chemist and apply it at night like cold cream,
washing it oft in the morning. In a few
days the mercolide in the wax will have
absorbed the disfiguring cuticle,, revealing
the fresh young skin underneath; you will
have a beautiful, clear, natural complexion.
The process is pleasant and harmless, making
the face look brilliantly attractive and youth-
ful. It also effectually removes such blem-
ishes as freckles, tan, moth patches, liver
spots, pimples, etc. Every woman should
keep a little mercolised wax on hand, as this
simple, old-fashioned remedy is the best eom-
plexioned beautifier and preserver known.
Blackheads Instantly Go.
A very simple, harmless and pleasant pro-
cess is now used to remove blackheads and
correct greasiness and large pores in the
skin. You have only to drop - a tablet of
stymol, obtained from the chemist, into a
glass of hot water and bathe the face with
the liquid after the effervescence has sub-
sided. The blackheads will then come right
off on the towel. The enlarged pores immedi-
ately contract to normal and the greasiness
disappears, leaving the skin smooth, soft and
cool and free from blemish. But to make sure
that this desirable result is permanent it is
advisable to repeat the treatment several
times at intervals of say about four or five
days.
Grey Hair Unnecessary.
One need not resort to the very question-
ably expedient of hair dye in order not to
have grey hair. The grey hair can easily be
changed back to a natural color in a few
days’ time merely by the application of a
simple, old-fashioned and perfectly harmless
home-made lotion. Procure from your chem-
ist two ounces of tammalite concentrate and
mix it with three ounces of bay rum. Apply
this to the hair a few times with a small
sponge, and you will soon have the pleasure
of seeing your grey hair gradually darkening
to the desired shade. The lotion is pleasant,
not sticky or greasy, and does not injure the
hair in any way.
Naturally Wavy Hair.
Good stallax not only makes the best possi-
ble shampoo, but has the peculiar property of
leaving the hair with a pronounced natural
“wave,” an effect presumably desired by many
ladies. A teaspoonful of the stallax granules,
dissolved in a cup of hot water, is ample for
a luxurious head wash, and leaves the hair
with a peculiar lustre and fluffiness obtainable
from nothing else as far as known. It is per-
fectly harmless, and can be obtained from
most chemists, although since it has been but
little used for this purpose it comes only in
lib. sealed original packages, enough to make
up 25 or 30 individual shampoos. [2

Without constant, every-day health, vigour is impossible •
your body must be kept to concert pitch. Your mind cannot be
alert and vigorous if your body is slack, listless and enervated.
Every day, as regularly as you wind up your watch, you
must wind up your system, in order that, purified
and vitalized, it shall run smoothly all day long.
Every morning the Kruschen habit —a half teaspoonful
of Kruschen Salts taken in hot water when rising—adds
to your life the pleasure that comes of a constant sense
of good health and abundant vigour.

The dreary anti-Liquor debate in Maori-
land’s House of Reps, had one bright spot.
Attorney-General Herdman got angry with
the Prohibs. and said that the encroach-
ments of the wowsers would lead to the re-
bellion of the people. “/ talked like that and
got three months,” snapped Paddy Webb,
lately from gaol, where he went as a result
of Herdman’s “loyal” activities.
E. Farrar, of Tunbridge (Tas.), has
offered £lOOO towards the purchase of a
battleplane to be handed to the British
Government. Another £l7OO is needed, and
it has been suggested that Tasmanian sheep-
farmers should contribute 1 per cent, of
their wool cheques. D’Arcy Addison, under-
secretary, who has been allotted the hard
work of completing the fund, says that he
could stand the shock of the idea being
adopted.
Richard Atkinson Price, who has been
expelled from the N.S.W. Leg. Assembly for
having a relaxed tongue, has been represen-
tative of Gloucester in eight Parliaments.
He is a native of Dublin, of which city his
uncle, Richard Atkinson, tapestry and poplin
manufacturer, was Lord Mayor in 1857. The
firm is still in existence and nearly a century
old.
The Temperance Party in Vic. is coming
out of its shell. Its representation at the
State elections this month will consist of
one candidate—John Barrett, secretary of
the Alliance, who will make one of the four
starters at East Melbourne. Farthing, the
sitting member, is standing this year as a
“Nationalist.” He began by putting up as an
Independent, but last time stood as a Lib-
eral. The other two candidates are A. R.
Mills (also a “Nationalist”) and Laborite
S. C. Walker—both previously unknown in
politics. In the final issue Labor has always
put Farthing in for East Melbourne; but
under the new conditions Barrett may get
the seat if he is able to avoid the bottom of
the poll on the first count.
“Murkah’s” message:—
“303” (B. 11/10/’l7) is inaccurate in writing
that Sir Oliver Lodge was the first man to demon-
strate the possibility of telegraphing without wires.
In 1831 Michael Faraday began the chain of dis-
coveries that led up to “wireless.” He found that
a current flowing in one circuit produced effects in
an entirely separate circuit. In 1837 the first patent
for wire-telegraphy was taken out. In 1867 Clerk
Maxwell read a paper in which he predicted the
existence of the waves now used. In 1887 Heinrich
Rudolph Hertz proved Maxwell’s theories, and made
many discoveries in regard to waves. He went so
far as to invent an instrument to detect their
presence, though it was found to be less sensitive
for the purpose than the coherer of Hughes (1879).
As in 1883 Fitzgerald had suggested the present
method of producing magnetic waves, and as Hertz
(who understood them) had produced a detector to
discover their presence, it is little- short of marvel-
lous that Hertz did not himself di;op to “wireless.”
It remained for Marconi, in 1896, to gather the
loose ends together, and he was the first man to
telegraph without wires. Marconi’s greatest dis-
covery was the advantage gained by “grounding”
the aerial. This vastly increased the transmitting
range. Thereafter progress was rapid. The English
Channel was bridged in 1899, and the Atlantic in
1901.
James R. Downie, F.C.S., of Sydney, tells
The Bulletin that he has been experiment-
ing on low-grade gold-bearing sands such as
those from the N. S. Wales North Coast, and
has succeeded in extracting up to 82 p.c. of
the contents by assay. The lowest result
from Byron Bay, New Guinea and Maoriland
sands was 73 p.c. “The cost of treating
very refractory sands is about 2s. per ton,
for chemicals alone, at present war prices.”
There is enough money for a comfortable
old age waiting for James R. Downie if
commercial results support his laboratory
tests.
A plague of locusts could not be more
devastating than a flight of Melbourne home-
service officials. A Barracks luncheon-room
was shut down by order from Headquarters
quite a year ago, allegedly because of the
attacks upon the soldiers’ tucker made by
these behind-the-linesmen. Now it is dis-
covered that they have been making the
most of what is going at the Y.M.C.A. rooms
opposite the Barracks. Nearly 200 of them
have been steadily in action, at thrippence
a head, upon the meals served by volunteers
for Billjim. Many of the dainties are pro-
vided by girls who do a cook-up in their
own homes before they come in, and they
serve a wonderful meal. Naturally they are
feeling pretty sore, as. the Y.M.C.A. faces
a loss here of: about £7OO a year, and it
would have been much greater in the last 12
months if most of the service hadn’t been
voluntary.
“Boyd Cable”: I am at present attached
t° Squadron R.F.C., which flies some
of the machines presented by various colonies
and communities overseas. There is one
which has painted on her bows “New South
Wales—Twrned and Armidale, No. 2,’’ and
I'm glad to be able to tell Tweed and Armi-
dale that the ’bus is one of the staunchest
and best, and that in her squadron she has
figured in as pretty fight-work as the heart
of warrior could desire. I am the more
pleased to pass on the glad tidings, because
this particular type of machine (which lacks
the speed and climb, and so on, of other and
later types) is one which it has been
fashionable in certain circles to merely
curse. They have certainly become a little
antiquated already; nevertheless those who
hate been flying them for many months hear
with regret that they are presently to be
mounted on a type which is more up-to-date
for flying and fighting. Certainly there’s work
in the old ’buses still. To-day, for instance, one
of them was attacked by 31 Huns when he
had separated from the flight. He fought
them singlehanded and put five of them
down and got back home. He doesn’t claim
they all crashed, and says one was only
driven off. damaged. But four went down
“out of control.” The other day seven of the
squad, met 2(5 Hun fast fighting scouts,
downed eight (all crashed, set on fire, etc.),
and lost only one of ours. In another scrap
six of ours fought 20, crashed six and came
home complete, although not intact. Some
day I’ll try ’n’ get hold of the Squadron
records and see if I can trace any of the
special stunts the “Tweed and Armidale No.
2” has figured in. Meantime it should please
her parents to know she flies in good com-
pany.


STOPAIN
A BOON TO MOTHERS.
After much thought and experiment
we have at last succeeded in completing
what vve believe is the most successful
treatment known for toothache. We
have placed it on the market under the
name of
STOPAIN
A Toothache Gum.
Besides being the latest and most
successful treatment for toothache,
Stopain is both simple and economical.
It is in the form of a gum and all you
have to do is to fill the cavity of Uie
tooth with it. It excludes the air and
stops toothache immediately.
No more burnt gums or blistered
tongues by liquid “cures” and this
alone means a lot to mothers.
Not only does Stopain relieve the pain,
but it also assists to preserve the tooth
until dental aid can be obtained, thus
making it invaluable to families in the
country who are often a day’s journey
from the nearest dentist.
Stopain is a boon to mothers. No
home should be without Stopain ; it is so
convenient and never fails to bring relief.
Stopain has been tried by thousands of
people and we have never yet known it
to fail when used according to directions.
Get it now for you never know when it
may be needed.

BE PREPARED. Like many other dangerous maladies diarrhoea often comes on unexpectedly and frequently
before the patient is aware of it some serious disorder has developed. During the warm
weather attacks of this kind are very frequent and often so swift in their results that life is in danger before the physician
can be summoned.
Those who have the interests of their family at heart keep a bottle of Chamberlain’s Colic and Diarrhoea Remedy on
hand for immediate use in cases of this kind. It is without doubt the best medicine prepared for diarrhoea, dysentery and
other disorders of, the bowels. If given at the first unusual looseness of the bowels the attacu may be avoided but even in
advanced stages it is a quick and most effective remedy.
Never leave home without a bottle of Chamberlain’s Colic and Diarrhoea Remedy in your luggage. The excitement
incidental to travelling and change of water and food often bring on diarrhoea, colic and pains in the stomach for which
speedy relief must be obtained and Chamberlain’s Colic and Diarrhoea Remedy can always be relied upon to do this.

Fast Eating Causes Dyspepsia
Few people chew their food sufficiently,
and to this fact is ascribed a good deal of
dyspepsia. The lirst action of the digestion
of food occurs in the mouth—mastication
and the mixing of food with saliva. Too
often food enters the stomach in a more or
less unbroken state and remains undigested.
A famous London doctor used to bluntly tell
his patients that the stomach is not a gizzard
and resents being put upon. The late Sir
Andrew Clarke made his patients count
their bites. He said that every mouthful of
animal food required thirty-two bites, and
lie made them count accordingly. Persons
who have been careless in their eating or
from some other cause are subjects of dys-
pepsia, should try the tonic treatment for
their complaint. They should avoid haste
at meal-time and take a course of Dr. Wil-
liams’ Pink Pills to restore stomach tone.
They act directly on the blood, and the first
respionse from the stomach is a better appe-
tite, freedom from distress after eating, and
an increase in ambition and energy gener-
ally. Try Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills as a
stomach tonic and see how your general
health improves. These pills are sold by all
medicine dealers.

HIGH day and holiday shoe 3, for wear on
extra-special occasions with the extra-
special gown, ought, one feels, to have
something distinctive about them, some-
thing that lifts them above the shoes for every-
day wear and tear. It is this distinctive, this
different look, that makes the charm of the most
elegant shoes in the Bostoclr range, the delightful
little black satin shoe here illustrated, for ex-
ample. One has only to glance at the picture to see
that here is something very smart and desirable.
Then think of it on, showing daintily, captivat-
ingly, beneath the flounced or scalloped hem of
the summer gown. Nothing could be more appro-
priate or more charming. And with all its
daintiness and piquancy, it is the most comfortable
and well-fitting of shoes, as indeed are all those
short-fronted styles, and will suit most women,
giving that ease, lightness and coolness which the
Australian climate requires.

“Melb”: Massina, recently dead, was pub-
lisher of Marcus Clarke’s “flis Natural
Life” as a serial iu the Australian Jour-
nal. Clarke, bringing the last of his copy,
said: “Thank Heaven, that’s finished.”
“And, thank Heaven,” says Massina, “an
incubus is off my mind !” “Don’t you think
there’s money in the book?” asked Clarke.
“No,” replied Massina. “Well, then,” mum-
bled Clarke, “you may as w T ell give me the
right of republication.” “Take it,” said
Massina, “and let me have done with the
whole blessed thing.” Clarke promptly went
to George Robertson, and raised an advance
of £25 on the script. By the way, Massina
said that Adam Lindsay Gordon’s last book
failed to bring in money. Gordon owed £75
th Massina, and meeting him said: “I sup-
pose you want some cash.” Massina:
“Printers usually do.” Gordon: “I will
bring you a cheque to-morrow.” He died on
the morrow.

“Mr. James,” of the S. M. Herald, fin-
ished his 82nd lap last month. He was born
at Leamington (Eng.), where his father.
John Fairfax, was a bookseller and printer
and founder of a newspaper, the Leamington
Spa Chronicle. The heavy costs incurred
in defending a libel action drove him, luckily
for his family, to Sydney in 1838. “Mr.
James” served his articles as a comp, on the
Herald, which he and two of his sons now
own. A while ago the profits were said to
be well over £lOO,OOO a year, and it is
generally understood in the business that
there isn't another newspaper in Australia
whose owners wouldn’t be glad to sw T ap for
“Mr. James’s” if profits were the only thing
they thought of.

“Masetto” : Gone to press at 68, Thomas

tury in the newspaper business. Smart

judge of athletics generally. He died in
harness —was on the job in the afternoon
and collapsed in the street during the even-

Another candidate. Harrie Nowland
writes to tell that she, not Edith Shirley,
was the first woman journalist to do Parlia-
ment gallery work in Australia. Says she:
In my various positions as a journalist, deputed
to supply the higher branches of presswork to both
daily *ind weekly newspapers, I have been a duly-
accredited gallery-notes writer for fully 10 years.
A seat in the central press gallery was allotted to
me by Speaker Leahy, but except when I have wished
to have the best possible view of new members, I
have preferred to occupy a much less conspicuous
position in a side gallery, and in accordance with
gallery-notes tradition in the House of Commons, I
do my work without any ostentatious use of paper
and pen.
Both these presswomen are Queenslanders.

“C.S.”: The ten N. S. Wales country
sheets that struggle forth each day outside
Sydney and Newcastle are being invited by
the A.J.A. to view matters in the light of
the recent award for the capitals. Eight
pounds are asked for editors and £6, £5 and
£4 for generals and juniors respectively. As
affairs stand just now the scribblers fall
below the typos in the matter of cash.
Jack Craig, the young editor of Weodf.r-
burn Express (Vic.), who handed over his
paper to a committee of townspeople while
he tackled the Huns, and who later w r as
seriously wounded in the head, has returned
to Australia. The wound proved more seri-
ous than was at first thought, and Haig
will probably have to send Fritz to press
without Craig's assistance.

“Z.”: Dr. Harold Williams, Petrograd
correspondent of London Daily Chronicle,
is a son of a M.L. Methodist
parson. As a hoy at the Christchurch High
School he showed an astonishing capacity
for languages, and compiled a dictionary of
certain Polynesian dialects. Resolved on
teaching, he went to Germany and took the
Doctor of Philosophy degree _at Munich.
Then came an offer of a post in a big uni-
versity in U.S.A. —a most attractive propo-
sition. But Williams had decided that jour-
nalism was his line. His chance came when
the Petrograd correspondent of the Times
was expelled for telling the truth about the
treatment of the Jews.

The only criticism S. M. Herald gives of
Dennis’s “Doreen” is the stale jest: “Those
who like that sort of thing will find it just
the sort of thing they will like.” Those who
don’t like that sort of literary criticism will
find it just the sort of thing they will have
to lump.
A DISOBLIGING MUSE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
When I lie me down to sleep
In my lowly bed,
Thought at once begins to flow,
\ erse lines marshal row on row,
Deathless rhymes and metres go
Flitting through my head.
Magic visions fill my mind,
Fancy wanders free;
In the words that suit them best
All my lofty thoughts are dressed;
In each stanza is compressed
Immortality.
When I’m in a Turkish bath
Bright ideas race
One another through my brain,
Rhymes arriving in their train,
Each, without the slightest, pain,
Slipping into place.
Poems which would make John Keats
Seem a scribbling hack,
Melodies that mount on high,
Stealing color from the sky—
These I fashion oft when I
Pen and paper lack.
But when at my desk I sit
Everything’s amiss:
Epithets hide from my sight,
Rhymes turn round and take to flight,
And I have to sweat to write
Futile spiff like this 1

HUNGRY AS A BEAR
AND CAN’T EAT.
If when meal-time comes you suffer from a
Yes-No kind of Hunger, you’re a Dyspeptic.
How to Treat Ail Stomach Troubles.
A great many people get angry when
you tell them they’ve got dyspepsia, but
way down deep In their stomachs they
know they’ve got it. “I’d love to eat it,
but I can’t,” is one kind of dyspepsia.
“I hate to think of it” is another kind.
There are thousands of people to-day
who hate their meals and love them at
the same time. They haven’t that fine
empty-hungry, eat-everything-in-sight
kind of feeling which goes with every
good healthy stomach.
And then there are others whose
mouths don’t water at meal time or at
any other time. They sit at the table
and go through the motions only because
it’s time to eat. These people, too, are
dyspeptics. Poor appetite, loss of
strength, nervousness, headache, offen-
sive breath, heartburn, indigestion and
dyspepsia are ail among the results of a
disordered stomach.
Every possible kind of stomach trouble
can be remedied by taking: something:
which will just take right bold of all the
food in your stomach and digest it alone
without the help of the stomach, and let
the stomach take a rest. DR. SHEL.D-
DON’S DIGESTIVE TABULES do this
very thing. They are composed of the
best digestives known to science, and are
absolutely safe. They do exactly the
work that a good strong healthy stomach
does. Dr. Sheldon’s Digestive Tabules
relieve all cases of dyspepsia, indiges-
tion, burning or irritation, loss of appetite,
bloat, brash, belching, aversion to food,
fermentation and gas in the stomach.
Dr. Sheldon’s Digestive Tabules will make
you feel “good” before and after each
meal, and make your stomach strong and
healthy again.
Make Your Stomach Strong 8 Healthy
Dr. Sheldon’s Digestive Tabules are sold everywhere at 1/6 per tin of 36
Tabules, and 2/6 per tin of 80 Tabules. Buy a tin, eat a good, square meal, and
then take the Tabules according to directions, and note the result. You will
forget all about it if you are not careful, for there will be no pain or disturbance,
and the food will be digested just as it used to be when your stomach was well
and strong. Furthermore your stomach will soon be restored again if you keep
on taking them, just as thousands upon thousands of other stomachs have been by
the sole and exclusive use of Dr. Sheldon’s Digestive Tabules.

Unspoken.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
WHERE are we going to, Stranger,
Stranger?
Where are we going to, you and I?
We have whispered our love in the black
wild weather
Till the rain seems fair as a sunlit sky.
But what grey place shall we reach together?
The dark wet city is paved with sapphire,
Where the lamps’ gold taproots shimmer
along,
As we pass in a daze of wonder and magic.
But we move like ghosts in a phantom
throng,
And the heart of us each is alone and tragic.
Were we not friends. O sudden Stranger?
Now stern between us the love-god stands,
And straight we are sundered by infinite
distance.
Yet into your weak and curious hands
I have thrust the joy of my whole existence.
And you—you have faltered a rich sur-
render ;
You give me the trust of your clear, clear
eyes.
But what of the hidden distrust you are
keeping?
Though passionate protest my whole soul
cries,
Some day I shall drown those eyes with
weeping.
Where are we drifting. Stranger, Stranger?
You smile like a flower in a nightmare place
Through the gloom and glare of the rain-
speared city,
And I smile down to your wikl-rose face,
And both of us stifle mad fear and pity.
We are caught, we are swept by the terrible
sweetness
To the ultimate exquisite anguish of life;
Not “With armor of love you have safely
engirt me,”
But “Love in your grasp is a deadly knife —
Lo, here, and here, and here may you hurt
me!”
O victress-victim, O sweetheart Stranger,
Pledged fast to a future we dare not guess,
Let us measure our gladness morrow by
morrow !
But —when will you murder my happiness?
And when shall I stab your' heart with
sorrow?
VICTORIA.
ELSIE COLE.
Port Dalrymple.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“AN phwat soort av- a place might this
here Port Dalrymple be, y’r Honor ?”
inquired Private Muldoon, brushing
and folding his master’s uniforms and cloth-
ing prior to packing them in the open travel-
ling trunks and valises that encumbered the
bare floor of Ensign Patrick Calder’s quar-
ters in the Barracks.
“ ’Tis the very devil of a place, I’m told,
Michael —the very last place in Australia or
the whole world. A fortnight from anywhere
—all forests and mountains, and with the
whole of Van Diemen’s Land between it and
the Derwent settlement. There is no one
there but prisoners and kangaroos and black-
fellows, and we poor devils who have to look
after them. ’Tis nigh as distant from Syd-
ney, as far as getting back from it goes, as
Sydney is from London. A hell of a place.
And we’ll rot there till the regiment is re-
lieved. I’ve half a mind to do as the C.O.
would like, and send in my papers—-damme
if I haven’t! ’Tis damnable, hellish, most
annoying.”
Mr. Calder was in black disgrace—both
with his Excellency Major-General Mac-
quarie and with Lieutenant-colonel Molle,
commanding the 46th —such disgrace as is
not lived down in a month, or in six months,
or in two years. The Governor was out-
raged, indignant and furious —Colonel Molle
bitter, cold and implacable.
He knew well that had it not been for Mac-
quarie’s old friendship for his uncle, Colonel
Calder of the 92nd, the C.O. would have
insisted upon bringing him before a court-
martial to explain why he had acted in a
manner that was unbecoming in an officer
and a gentleman, and, more particularly,
deeply scandalous to the regiment. Indeed,
the Colonel had almost quarrelled with his
Excellency, when the latter, as Commander-
in-Chief of the forces, had over-ridden his in-
tention of relieving the regiment finally of
the blighting presence of Patrick Calder,
Ensign. Macquarie had insisted that it
would be a sufficient punishment of Mr. Cal-
der’s offence to send him to Port Dalrymple,
as the settlement upon the river Tamar in
Van Diemen’s Land was then called, upon
detachment duty. Greatly against his will
the Colonel had consented to forego proceed-
ings by court-martial. But he had not re-
frained from expressing himself very freely
to Mr. Calder, in the presence of the Adju-
tant and the Senior Major.
“You are a d —d cad, sir—a cad ! You
have done such a thing as makes you unfit to
associate with your brother officers. You are
a jest and a joke in the barrack-rooms —you
are the talk of the town. Your damnable
escapade will never be forgotten in the Army.
By God, sir! I could horsewhip you for the
disgrace you have brought upon the old regi-
ment. The tale will never be forgotten. Get
out of my sight, d —n you—and don’t come
into the Mess while I am there.”
Major Boucart, the second-in-command,
had nodded pained agreement with these sen-
timents—and Mr. Calder remembered with
gratitude the friendly wink of the Adjutant,
standing behind the Commanding-Officer.
But the tale, which kept the Sydney of
1816 laughing for more than nine days, and
was, indeed, remembered of the 46th in the
wider world of the Messes and the Clubs in
England and India for perhaps twenty-five
years, has been so long forgotten now that a
brief allusion to it here may not be out of
place.
This is what had happened.
The glad tidings of Wellington’s victory
over Napoleon at Waterloo did not reach
Sydney until the January following that tre-
mendous event. When they did do so, they
were announced by the Governor in a gen-
eral-order, in which he eloquently exhorted
the people to rejoice in their private capacity,
as he commanded the civil and military
establishments to do officially.
Casting about for some means of marking
their private gratification at the news,
Ensign Calder and liis friend Lieutenant
Gregory Wicks, R.N., of 11.M.5. Emu, had
decided upon giving a picnic down the harbor
to two ladies of their acquaintance. Now.
the characters of these ladies were as dubi-
ous as their physical attractions were in-
dubitable. To have been seen in their com-
pany—by either the Governor, the Colonel or
the Captain commanding H.M.S. Emu —
\vould not have advanced the reputations of
either of the two young officers. So, when
liis Excellency, out riding with Mrs. Mac-
quarie in the neighborhood of the South
Head, and being minded to explore Parsley
Bay from the land side, rode into a bacchan-
alian orgy on that pretty beach, of which the
principal feature was a fight with the bare
knuckles between the soldier and sailor ser-
vants of Messrs. Calder and Wicks—both
stark naked, and being vigorously applauded
by the two officers, who were -also naked, and
the two hidies similarly unclad—the result-
ing sensation, hullabaloo, scandal and shout
of laughter on the part of the community of
Sydney may only be described as prodigious.
The beautiful Mrs. Devine and the sprightly
Kitty Levi, both prisoners of the Crown on
license, were exiled to the Coal River. Mr.
Wicks was denied further shore leave before
the sailing of his ship. And we find the
unhappy Mr. Calder superintending the pack-
ing of his belongings this morning, in readi-
ness to proceed in the Lady Nelson, on the
following day, to Port Dalrymple.
Came into the room to the sad young man
that good fellow, excellent soldier and kindly
friend of the sore-at-heart, Captain-and-
Adjutant Peter Blake. Private Muldoon
stood to attention as he entered, and then, at
a sign, slipped noiselessly outside.
Striding across to the dejected subaltern
oh the bedside, Blake slapped an immense
paw on his shoulder as he rose, saying, with
much heartiness:
“Patrick, my boy, cheer up! I've blar-
neyed the C.O. into giving you twenty-four
hours’ leave to attend to your urgent busi-
ness affairs. That'll be dodging your duns, I
suspect,” he said with a grin. He went on :
“Get out of Barracks. Go to blazes for
the day and night. Paint the town scarlet, if
ye’ve a mind to. Do yourself proud. ’Tis
your last chance for a twelvemonth or more.
Only—keep clear of the Colonel, and, for
God’s sake, if you see Macquarie coming,
crawl into a drain, or climb a tree and hide
in the branches. Make the most of your
time. Ye’ll be able to have a last flutter, and
ye’d better make as much of it as ye can—
but turn up to parade your detachment at
4 o’clock to-morrow afternoon. You’re to
embark on the Lady Nelson at five. Now be
off with you, and say au revoir to all your
disreputable friends who are out of gaol.
I’ll see after your men, and Muldoon’ll look
after your kit. Off with you—hut don’t pass
by the Orderly Rooms. Colonel Molle’s still
in there, and very sour. Good-luck, old boy !
Ye’ll get over this.”
Mr. Calder braced himself up. There were
tears in his eyes as he gripped the Adjutant’s
hand.
“Thank you, Blake —thank you, sir. You’re
a d —<l good fellow. ’Twas most kind of
you—in the Orderly Room yesterday. I don’t
deserve it. But I’ll do as you say. Thank
you, sir—thank you.”
Captain Blake went out, grinning goodwill
all over his cheery red face. He paused a
moment on the verandah to whisper to Pri-
vate Muldoon:
“Look after him, Michael. He’s on leave
over-night. See he comes back to time.”
Michael Muldoon saluted, winked and mut-
tered : “Thrust me for that, sorr!”
n * * *
Scarcely heeding which way he went, after
he had slipped unostentatiously from the
Barracks by a little doOr in the corner of the
great quadrangular wall that surrounded its
ranges of buildings, Mr. Calder strolled down
George-street towards the Cove. He had no
very clear intentions as to how he should put
in the few hours of liberty that remained to
him, but some vague sense of sympathy with
his companion in misfortune, Lieut. Gregory
Wicks, R.N.—known as “Pansy,” because of
a scandalous episode in his career with a
girl at Gosport—led him to the waterside to
take, at least, a glance of commiseration at
that unfortunate sailor-man’s ship.
Out at the mouth of the sparkling Cove
lay H.M.S. Emu, trim and ready for sea. He
- gazed at her despondently for a good five
minutes, and then turned back towards the
town.
At the door of Timothy Naylan’s Spotted
Dog Inn, Mr. Calder stopped, hesitated a
moment, and, stooping his head, entered the
dingy bar-room. There was no one there.
He crossed it to a door at the back. He
heard voices and laughter, and started
slightly as he recognised the tones. He lifted
the latch and went in.
“Hell!” howled a glad and sun-tanned
youth who sat by a table in the corner, drink-
ing rum with the red-headed Naylan. “By
G —d, ’tis Patrick himself!”
“Pansy!” exclaimed Mr. Calder. “Why, I
thought they had you in irons aboard the
Emu. Good Lord —here’s a meeting !”
“Not a bit of it,” laughed Mr. Gregory
Wicks. “The old man, our skipper, is a
sport—a true blue. He’s never done laugh-
ing over Parsley Bay—says he’d have given
his glass-eye to’ve seen Macquarie’s face
the other day. He’s let me come ashore to
make some necessary purchases for the voy-
age—in plain clothes, and on condition I
didn’t lay myself athwart the Governor’s
cable, or play the b —y soldier, as he calls it
—meaning the fool. No offence, Patsy. But
how about you? I was told ye were for a
court-martial an’ God knows what. Lord
save us —but this is a bit of luck! I’d
given up all hope of saying good-bye to ye,
Pat. More grog, Tim-—lashin’s o’ grog. I
was just tellin’ him the true an’ partic’lar,
Patrick —how Peggy and Kitty squealed,
and ran from Macquarie. An’ they’ve been
sent to the Coal River! Too bad! A

ACCIDENTS are always happening in the
kitchen, in the dining-room, in the garden,
at the children’s play, and during every kind
of work or athletic pursuit.
Directly Zam-Buk is applied to L wound or
sore it serves to alleviate the pain and
inflammation, reduce any swelling, and
prevent the place “ taking bad ways.
Zam-Buk also has splendid antiseptic
properties.
In a natural way belonging to the
natural extracts from which it is
manufactured, this balm stops
the growth of harmful microbes
that account for the festering
of a neglected or wrongly
treated sore, it kills or nul-
lifies all dangerous influ-
ence at once, and causes
the tissues, which it
has first made clean
in a medical sense,
to knit together
once more until
all trace of the
sore or injury
has gone.
Zam-Buk is
the ideal
healer for
daily
home
use.
Trod
on a
Rusty Nail.
Poisoned Foot Healed.
Mrs. M. Dehon, who lives
at 53 Little Albion Street
Surry Hills, Sydney, says:
“One day whilst crossing the
yard I slipped, and a rusty
nail penetrated my foot and
caused a painful I-jury. Within
a few days blood-poisoning set
in, and my foot and leg began to
be extremely inflamed and swollen.
Night after night I would lie awake
in agony, and often the pain made me
cry out aloud. For some time I was
too crippled to get about, or do anything"
After reading about Zam-Buk I sent for
a large pot of the balm. I began to apply
dressings of Zam-Buk to the injury twice
daily, and it soon effected a noticeable im-
provement. My foot was freed of pain, the
swelling and inflammation were greatly reduced,
and the wound began to look a lot healthier.
“I persevered with Zam-Buk until the wmund was
thoroughly rid of all bad matter, and then it healed
rapidly and perfectly. I cannot speak too hiehlv
of Zam-Buk.”
For everyday skin sores, flesh wounds and injuries, Zam-
Bnk is a reliable healer to keep always handy. Of all
chemists and storekeepers, at 1/6 and 3/6 per pot.

d—d shame —but they’ll liven up Newcastle,
won’t they—the pretty dears !”
“When do you sail, Pansy?”
“Thursday—three days from now. And
I'll be glad to tread on Portsmouth Hard
again. But what’s your move, Patrick?
What are they doing with you?”
Mr. Calder cursed deeply, bitterly and
blasphemously. His words could not be
printed here.
“Port Dalrymple—that’s my fate. The
last place on earth, so I’m told —the very
last. I’m to go on detachment there until
the regiment is relieved, and that means a
year, if it’s a day—most likely 18 months.
Oh, hell, Pansy—l almost wish Bonaparte
had won at Waterloo. Damme if I don’t.
I wish we’d never seen those darn women.
I wish Macquarie had died in India. I
wish the regiment had never come to this
forsaken hole. I wish”
Mr. Wicks laughed.
“Wishin’ will do nothing, Patrick. Ye
must face facts. Cheer up, old cock! I’ll
tell ye what we’ll do. ’Tis our last day
together, for the Lord knows how long.
We’ll spend it here at Tim Naylan’s—
quietly. We’ll make him order in the best
dinner can be got in Sydney, an’ we’ll drink
each other's healths. I know there are as
many people lookin’ for you with little bills
as there are for me —an’ we’ll be safe here.
That’s our lay—a quiet afternoon, a parting
cup or two, and to the Devil with Macquarie.
That’s it, my buck. A communion of souls
—if you’ve got yours with you. You don’t
look as if you Had. Cheer up ! We’ll have
half a dozen last hours together—l’m to be
aboard at seven o’clock —confess our sins,
and give one another final absolution.”
And so, Mr. Calder falling in with this
agreeable proposition, these two ornaments
of the sister services set themselves, more
or less happily, to celebrate the divergence
of their paths.
It was a beautiful night, and Colonel
Molle, having dined at Government House,
sat with his Excellency over their wine in
the wide verandah of the big cottage on the
hillside. In the drawing room Mrs. Mac-
quarie accompanied herself upon the harp,
while she sang, very sweetly, those old Scotch
ballads in which her lord delighted. The
little town in the valley was bathed in a
pale radiance, and the white fronts of the
houses over on the Rocks gleamed in the
light of the rising moon. From a ship out
in the Cove came the whining scrape of a
fiddle, and beyond her black hulk the dark
heights of the North Shore outlined their
wooded crests against the indigo of the sum-
mer night.
“I must confess, General,” Colonel Molle was
saying—he knew that his Excellency delighted
in his army rank, coming from a senior offi-
cer—l must —er —pronounce the opinion, the
very decided opinion, that the young man is
hopeless. Quite hopeless.”
“Indeed, my dear Molle, I assure you that
1 grieve to hear you say so,” sighed Mac-
quarie. “I hardly knew his father, but his
uncle, Jack Calder, and I have been friends
si#ce we were young men in North America.
We have served together in India- —he saved
my life at Seringapatam. I would do any-
thing for a relative of his —and this lad is
his godson. Colonel Calder is a bachelor,
and a wealthy one. I do not doubt that
Ensign Calder will be his heir.”
“Ha —then the estate will need to be a
large one to answer to that young gentle-
man’s requirements. But, my dear General,
I still think ’twould have been better, for
the service at uny rate, to have brought him
to a court-martial over this affair. He will
inevitably bring such a fate upon himself,
sooner or later. However, since you wish it,
I am willing to give him another chance.
Perhaps Port Dalrymple will have a steady-
ing effect upon him. There should be little
opportunity to make a fool of himself there
—from all accounts I have of the place.”
“Well, well—l hope so. But enough of
Mr. Calder and his rogueries.” Macquarie
changed the disagreeable subject. “ ’Tis
good news we have by the Roehampton to-
day, my dear Molle. Bonaparte’s surrender
to Captain Maitland on the Bellerophon—
very momentous ! Very momentous, indeed !
It means peace at last in Europe. What
will they do with the fellow now? Hang
him, I hope.”
“I have hardly glanced at my mail, and
have not yet looked at the London papers.
Had a busy day. But I should think—good
God. sir. what’s that?”
The Colonel started from his chair and
peered out into the moonlight, towards the
guard-house down at the end of the gravel
drive.
Three figures held argument in the gate-
way—strenuous argument, of loud tone on
the one side and subdued entreaty on the
other.
“To Hell with Port Dalrymple!"
This emphatic statement was delivered
with great distinctness, and might have
echoed over on the Rocks, so still and breath-
less was the summer night. Even Mrs. Mac-
quarie in the drawing-room must have heard
it, for the tinkling and twanging of the harp
ceased abruptly, and the charms of Annie
Laurie remained unsung.
“By Heavens!” exclaimed the Colonel,
“ ’tis that young reprobate ! I’ll”
But the Governor laid a restraining hand
upon his sleeve. “No, no, my dear Molle —I
hey of you. Wait a moment. Do you join
Mrs. Macquarie. Let me attend to this—for
the sake of Jack Calder. If you meet him,
you cannot avoid taking action. Do leave the
matter to me—l entreat you. As a favor,
leave it to me.”
With a muttered anathema upon all dis-
reputable subalterns, Colonel Molle passed
through the open French doors and joined
the Governor’s lady in the drawing-room.
Quietly and cautiously his Excellency step-
ped down into the drive, keeping close to the
edge of the verandah, and in the black
shadow of the white house. The moon was
full, and it was almost as bright as day out
of the shadows. Down in the valley the lights
of the town twinkled, and as lie strode
along to the end of the building, treading
softly, the clear call of the bugles in the
Barrack Square on its further slope sounded
the “First Post,” the pealing notes echoing
musically through the night.
“I tell you, Sergeant—mus’ see s Ex’lenzy.
Mos’ ’portan’ matter —mos’ vital fusher pros-
pers. ’Zec’lenzy ’t 'ome?”
“Mr. Calder, Mr. Calder, sir,” the sergeant
of the guard was speaking, huskily and en-
treatingly. “FT Gawd’s sike. y’r Honor, git
back to y’r quarters. Mr. Macquarie ’ll ’ear
ye, sir, in a moment. ’E can't see ye to-
night, sir—he’s got company. Be th’ Lora,
y’r Honor, ’tis th’ Colonel himself is with
him! Gawd ’elp us all if oP Molly ’ears this
barney. Come, sir, be a good horf’cer, an go
’ome. ’Ere’s Mike Muldoon ’ll tike ye to y r
quarters. Won’t ye, Mike?”
“FT th’ love av Hiven, y’r Honor, give
over this dam’ foolishness, an’ come away
wid meseif. We’ll go .back t' Tim's. Anny-
where! We’ll go see th’ gur-rls at Sally
Downey’s—on’y, f'r th’ love av Jasus, come
out o’ this. Sure, the ould boyo himsilf _ll
be out to ye this next minit —so he will!”
Private Muldoon hissed his persuasions in
a hoarse half-whisper.
“Y’ don’ un’stan’, Michael. Mos’
nesh’ry see Mist’ Macquarie. Wheresli
letter? Ah, here ’tis —letter from Wottle
an’ Aliggs, no, Mottle an’ Wiggs. Line’s
Inn Fieldsh, s’lic’tors to eshtate. My
s’lic’tors. Uncle .John’sh dead —lef’ me all’s
money—fine housh ’n Kent. ’M an heir-to —
to ’mense forch’n. Ver-y lucky—won’ have
to’ go Por’ Dalrymple. Dam ’ Por’ Dal-
rymple—not goo’ ’nough Patrick Calder.”
“Aw, sure, lave it to th’ marnin’, y’r
Honor. ’Twill kape till marnin’,” pleaded
Private Muldoon.
“Good God!” muttered Macquarie to him-
self—“So my old friend’s gone. And this
young blackguard succeeds him! Poor Jack
Calder. But I’ll see that this rascal goes
to Van Diemen’s Land —if ’tis but to give
him time to meet his fortune soberly. He
must be saved —if only for good Jack’s
name’s sake.”
The Governor moved quietly towards the
little group at the gate, keeping in the
shadow of the line of shrubs that bordered
the eastern side of the drive.
When he was but a few yards from them
he waited for a chance which he expected,
when Muldoon looked fearfully, and in des-
pair, towards the lights shining out on the
drive from the open windojvs of the house.
Then he w>ved his ar. t into the moonlight.
“Muldoon!” he called softly.
Mr. Calder’s anxious servant saw him, and
recognised who it was.
“Hould him, Cayley—liould him f’r th’ love
of Mary,” he whisoered to the sergeant.
“No goo’ f’r Pat Calder,” repeated the
gallant officer. “Hellova plashe. Dam' Por’
Dalrymple!”
Muldoon came running to Macquarie,
halted before him, and saluted.
“Private Muldoon,” whispered his Excel-
lency, “can you quiet him?”
Muldoon hesitated.
“I cud," thin, y’r Ex’lency—but ’tis a
sayr’ous matther, strikin’ y’r shupayrior
officer. But ’tis th’ on’y way I do be
thinkin’ of.”
“Listen then. Quieten him. And when
you have done so, go round to the garden-
ers’ tool-shed, and get the large barrow you
will find there. Wheel him to an inn for
the night. But, mind, I hold you respon-
sible that he sails in the Lady Nelson to-
morrow afternoon. Do you understand?
Here’s a guinea for you. Don’t talk of
this.”
Private Muldoon gaped at the Governor.
“Have I y’r Honor’s orders?” he gasped.
“No—only a hint. But take it—for your
master’s sake.” Muldoon saluted, and the
Governor walked quietly back in the shadows.
“Only a drunken fellow at the guard-
house,” he said carelessly as he entered the
drawing-room. “I’ve sent him packing.”
To Sergeant Cayley and the gaping mem-
bers of the guard was vouchsafed an astound-
ing spectacle.
“Thash ri’, ol’ Michael,” Mr. Calder greeted
liis returning servant. “Ye foun’ th’ Gov’nor,
did ye? Thash id’—lesh go in. Mus’ tell
him death of oldesli frien’—”
Neatly and powerfully. Private Muldoon
punched Ensign Patrick Calder on the jaw, so
that he crumpled in a heap upon the gravel.
“Gawd strike me blue, Muldoon—ye’re a
pris’ner. Strikin’ y’r superior horf’cer.
Blime —you’ll be for it!”
“Hould y’r whisht, Jim Cayley,” hissed
Private Muldoon. “Sind one av y’r min for
th’ big barry in th’ toolshed. Macquarie's a
gintleman!"

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
There’s a new moon over the hill to-night
Slim breasted und shy as a growing girl;
And hiding her eyes with their warm delight,
Is a wisp of cloud like a wind-blown curl.
The evening star through the twilight grey
Lights the hedge-bound road that twists to
the south;
In your pink cotton frock you must pass that
way,
With your roseleaf cheeks and your dewv
mouth.
Through the green of the fields we will walk
a space,
Then I’ll lift you to rest on the old stone
wall,
ith my arms a-thrill to your slender grace,
But never a sign must I give at all.
For shy and far as a woodland moth
Is the soul that your Dryad limbs enfold
And a man were fool or a soulless Goth ’
I >id' he crush the bloom from the wings of
gold.
In your pink cotton frock and your buckled
shoes
And the winsome joy of your twenty years
There’s never a faery dream you’ll lose
A\ hile I’m on guard for the sha'mes and fears.
The young moon’s early a-bed to-night.
So we’ll walk to your father’s home in the
South,
And never a kiss in the high starlight
I'll stf>f »l from the rose of your wild sweet
mouth.
N.S.W.
JOHN EGAN.

SOMETHING
BETTER!
If Engineers and Steam-plant Owners would only
realise the importance of EFFICIENTLY insulating
their Boilers, Steam Pipes, etc., more attention might
be paid to this particular matter. Great economies
can be effected in this direction, in some cases the coal
consumption being reduced as much as 50%. But the
insulating material must be of the very best.
Carbonate of Magnesia is to-day recognised as the best
non-conductor of heat. Newall's Coverings are com-
posed of 85% of this material, and 15% Asbestos —the
Asbestos being used for binding purposes only—and in
addition possess Innumerable advantages over all other
forms of lagging. Newall’s Coverings are used, practi-
cally exclusively, by the British Admiralty, N.S.W.
and Victorian Governments, and have been used
throughout the THtimo. White Bay, Melbourne, Perth
and Canberra Power Stations.
