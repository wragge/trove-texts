THE BULLETIN.
SATURDAY, JANUARY 28 1888
Labour and the Press.
The past year, like matly years of depres-
sion which have prec sded it, has left t he
poor all the world over a little poorer and a
Jitble hungrier aud more desperate than
before. Everywhere there have been
periodical struggles between Capital and
Labour—fitful skirmishes, which merely
foreshadow the great battle that is yet to
come, and of these Australia, which already
feels bitterly the oppression of foreign
monopoly figuring under the specious de-
siguation of foreign capital for the develop-
ment of the country, has had Its share.
Among these recurrent upheavals, the Ade-
laide shipping dispute was probably the bit-
terest, and the one whose effects will be
longest felt. The who’e of the Aust-aban
Press, from Adelaide to Cocktown, and from
Perth to Port Darwin, had its say about this
matter in the interea s of the shipowners,
bub the true history of the struggle has never
yet been —probably never will be—written.
In this cas?, as in many others, Walt Whit-
man’s remark about the American Secession
War may be adapted as an expression going
remarkably near to the everlasting truth —
“ The real combat never gets into the news-
papers.” In the else, of course, of the re-
actionary organs, papers after the pattern of
the played-out London Times— of which our
two biggest examples are the Argus and the
Sydney Morning Herald —this sort of
thing is natural enough ; and, Indeed, when
the question is one that In any way concerns
“vested interests,” to the maximum of
shallow ignorance will be found added the
maximum of deliberate misrepresentation.
But, In the popular Press—ln the so
called Democratic organs, it would
astonish anyone who did not under-
stand the strictly “ business prin-
ciples ” on which they are conducted, to
find them also, with little variety, “ among
the false prophets.” This leads us to ask If
the claim and title of such papers as the Mel-
bourne Age and the Sydney Daily Tele-
graph to being popular and democratic is
not a mere pretence, and If the Democracy
is not quite as unrepresented in reality in
Australia as in England or France, as in
Germany or Austria, in Italy or Spain.
• • •
What is the meaning of Democracy ? The
word comes from two Greek words, demos
and kratein, and signifies the rule or power
of the people. It was the Athenians who
first used the name and applied it to them-
selves, and the popularity of proper names
compounded of this same word Demos (D.-
mosthenes, for example, which signifies “ the
strength of the people ’) bean witness to
the emphatic belief of the Athenians in a
joint rule of all the citizens, as opposed to
the despots of the East or the North, or of
the oligarchies which administered neigh-
bouring states like Sparta and Thebes. Athens
was the only true Democracy of antiquity.
The so-called Roman Republic was based on
the dual power of Piebs and Patricians, and
half its history is that of a reckless and
selfish oligarchy, and the other half of a
selfish despotism made reckless by un-
limited power. None the less Rome called
itself a Republic, and the example of the
first envious aristocratic noodle who drove
out her kings, and of the second who slew
C/EBAR “ because he was ambitious,” are
held up as examples of patriotism, whereas
these men were only narrow-minded, super-
cilious fools who fought and perished for
caste aud clique. The Roman “ Demo
cracy ” never existed. When the Emperors,
beaded by Augustus, a*tempted to make it
a reality in Italy, they found that the age-
long rule of the aristocrats, with their land-
grabbing policy and those huge estates which
Horace laments as a national calamity.
had practically abolished the yeomen and
the mechanics. No, Athena alone in anti-
quity held the ideal of a true Democracy, and
her passionate cult of the p?rfect balance, the
“ nothing in excess,” in her spiritual life,
found its parallel inhersociallifelnherequally
passionate cult of equality whether in wealth
or status. “ Choose equa'ity and shun greed,”
says their great dramatist Menander, in a
day when this choice and aversion were in
the wrong direction, and the noble Athenian
Ideal, the beacon-light cf antiquity, was on
the eve of being lest in the waves of ambi-
tion and avarice.
• ♦ *
For ages this ideal, the true Democratic
ideal, remained out of sight. The e&rly
Christians had it : they derived it fiom
Jesus, who was before all a man of the
People—who despised and bated and loathed
the rich. But, by the time Christianity
came on the scene of civilisation as a power,
it was already corrupt. The Christian Em-
perors and the Popes were as much the
friends of greed, and the foes of equality as
their Pagan predecessors. It is in England
—in the England of the 14th century—that
once more this ideal rises, and once more the
Democratic demand is put forth.
* • *
What makes the Peasants’ Revolt of 1381
so important is just this. It anticipated the
French Revolution of 1793 in every particu-
lar but one—success. It proclaimed the
liberty, equality, and fraternity of all man
kind, and raised Its passionate protest
against the civilisation of the few or die de-
gradation of the many. In those days, the
few meant the well born—birth and wealth
going together—and the catch-words of these
first of our modern Socialists still ring, not
only in our ears, but in our hearts.
“ When Adam delved, end Eve span.
Who was then the gentleman ?
asked John Ball, the striker cf the move-
ment. “If we all cime of the same father
and mother,” he reiterated, “ how can they
say or prove that they are better than we,
if it he not that they make us gain for them by
our toil what they spend in their pride ? ”
And is not this just what the modern
Socialist asks, only not so much from the
p!ayed-out children of birth, as from the
triumphant and tyrannical children of
wealth ?
The next effort after Democracy was made
by the Puritans, or rather, by a section of
thtm, the Independents. And these soon
found that, when they had conquered Kings
and Aristocrats, they had a worse foe to face
in their own ranks. Themiddle class had made
its appearance, ‘’Relieve the oppressed,”
wrote Cromwell fiercely from Dunbar to
the Parliament of well-to-do “ saints ” in
London who fattened on the victories of the
rank and-file of the army ; “hear the groan
of poor prisoners. Be pleased to reform the
abuses of all professions. If there be anyone
that makes many poor to make one rich, that
suits not a commonwealth ! ” Wbat else does
the modem Socialist say when he faces an
Astor, a Jay Gould, a Vanderbilt, or a
Duke of Westminister, a Brassey, a Cham
berlain ? But the Puritan effort after
Democracy lost itself in the quagmires of
religions fanaticism, and the rejection of the
impossible Reactioniarism of the Stuarts
only resulted In the derpotism of the
nobles which remained unbroken till 1830,
* ♦ *
The people next to raise the Democratic
demand were the French iu 1793, and the
careerof the Revolution and of Navoleon was,
despite aberrations and even prostitutions, a
frantic endeavour to enforce the need of
men’s equal rights upon Europe. That
endeavour ultimately failed, and in the long
peace that followed on it the stupendous dis-
coveries of machinery created the new class
of Capital and the equally new class of
Labour. Competition brought down wages
to the life-line, and sometimes even below
it, aud when, in 1832, the English middle-
class, when, in 1852, the French middle-
class, entered on their lease of supreme
power, they had ceased to be the Democracy
at all The history of the last 50 years has
been the history ot the combat between the
pseudo-Democracy or middle-class and the
real Democracy or Labour. The Chartists’
Riots were the first outburtt cf Labours
wrath at having teen fooled by the Reform
Bill ot 1832. The French Commune cf 1870
was only a repetition of the same
fact, defined and intensified. The “ Liberal
i m ” of the English, cr of the
French bourgeoise Governments of the last 50
years, has meant just this—the cant of
“Democratic” ideas, the profession of the
middle-c'aaa (of those who are capitalists or
hope to become so), of the love for “liberty,
equality, fraternity,” and their dogged de-
termination to keep Labour in its present
enslaved and plundered condition.
* # #
“ Mow can they say or prove they be better
than toe, if it be not that they make us gain
for them by our toil what they spend in their
pride ?” Even so! The whole present
social system rests on the iniquity of that
'■'make:' Competition compels Labour to
take what in no way represents the worth of
its work, what more and more represents
merely the minimum on which a strong
man can exist. The insult, then, t”c
mockery of such a suggestion as that made
some time ago by the Daily Tele-
graph—that since, forsooth, the times are
bad, Labour should not mind sharing the
loss with Capital, and wages be re-
duced—becomes apparent! In other words,
if the 100 per cent, profit of work
—Capital having, thinks to the thumb-screw
of competition, had its 97 per cent.—be re-
duced to 70, Labour should give up a p :rtion
of her wretched three ! What is the good of a
paper like this calling hse f “Democratic ” ?
It spsaks and acts in t u e interests, not of
the Demos, but o? the psuedo-Demos ; nob
of Labour, the euff-rar from competition,
but of the middle-class—the enjoyer of the
middle-man’s plunder. Labour has no voice.
The Press is c'osed to It by prejudice and
interes*-. The statement o! its cause lies ia
the hands of its enemies. Everyone who
knows the real 1 i-tory of trade disputes
knows that the casus belli put forward
is never the real one. The employers
ate clever men who work to their
ends by clever means. Ihe employe is are
ignorant souls who feel bitterly the
initial iniquity of the whole thing, but who
see that to declare what they believe —
namely, that they are being systematically
plundered of the worth of their work—that
the ships they load and man, the factor es
they keep busy, are theirs, and no one
else’s, if the fact of having made and n at-
tained in existence a thing cinstitutes ths
ownership i f it—they see that, to s ate this,
would do no good but rather harm, and they,
too, are compelled to work to their ends by
the means they have at hair!—patience,
courage, combination ! It is no matter that
their foes lie about them, that their so-
called friend?, the “ popu'ar Press, 1 ’ misre-
present them, An end mu t yet come to
their great initial iniquity, because it is an
hrquity and because 99 people out of every
100 are concerned in its abolishment. The
capitalist must go, or Democracy must go
‘ If there he anyone that makes many poor to
make one rich, that suits not a Common-
wealth.” Tee trick whereby Labour over
all the earth is defrauded of the worth of its
work must at last be patent to all, and the
poor will no longer be made by the rich to
“ gain for the rich by the toil of the poor, what
the rich spend in their pride”
The Military Regime In Australia.
The great Imperial schem?, by which this Con-
tinent is to be degraded to the level of an outly-
ing English province, is steadily unfolding, and
England is once more knocking at the gates of
futurity for the President of the United States of
Australia. The miserable African expedition of
three years ago impressed the Jingoes of Britain
with the idea that Australia was tilled with a
hunger for military glory, and the party which is
always wanting to go out and kill something has
ever since regarded this land as a possible recruit-
ing ground for the miserable little army which
fights the battles of England on two meals a day.
The late Imperial Conference gave the astute
Salisbury a chance to size up the statesmen of
Australia, and he weighed them one by one, and
found them snobs and traitors almost to a mm.
In return for the meanest tide which the Queen
can confer —a title which, in England, ranks little
higher than the medal which is conferred upon a
Cochin-China rooster at a country hog-exhibition
—they virtually pledged themselves to a scheme
which would place Australia at the mercy of a
foreign fleet commanded by a foreign admiral,
and the partial success of this naval offence
scheme is already leading to further developments
of the great Imperial conspiracy.
* * *
For the last few weeks a strange rumour has
filled the air—a rumour which points to further
aggression of a kind which will reduce Australia
to the level of Ireland or India, and place her ito
the same position as that which Bulgaria occupied
during the 100 years when she groared under the
yoke of the .Selims and Amuraths of Constanti-
nople. The report bears no direct mark of official
sanction, but it is fathered by the organ of Im-
perialism in Melbourne, and is evidently thrown
out to test the feeling of a nation which has
already endured much for the great cause of
foreign slavery and British grovel. For many
years the land forces of Australia have been
maintained on an independent basis; the
infamous New South Wales Corps has long been
a thing of the past, and the troops which
massacred the oppressed diggers of Ballarat have
gone back to the land where they learned their
first lessons in barbarism and slaughter. The good
old days when Australia was garrisoned like a
conquered country are left far away among the
slimy wrecks of history, andno one regrets them ex-
cept possibly the erstwhile Plain Bill in his
hermitage at Manly, and a few other Tories of
the same dismal school. But the fatuous Salis-
bury still dreams of a day when that old history
will be revived, and when an army commanded
by an Imperial officer, and directed from the
offices in Downmg-street will overawe the grow-
ing Republican party in Melbourne and Sydney,
just as another British host endea-
voured to overawe Israel Putnam’s little army
at Boston more than a century ago. >' The troops
of the various Australian colonies, it is proposed,
shall be organised into one force, under the com-
mand of a general who will be kindly lent by
Britain for the purpose, and who will be independent
of all local author! i y, and with the accomplishment
of this scheme, Australia will be wiped off the
roll of nations, and will become, like Ireland or
Burmah, a military province dependent on Britain
and ruled by the British bureaucracy.
* ♦ ♦
The British military despot whom it is thus
proposed to foist upon Australia could be con-
trolled by no colonial authority, and the Parlia-
ments and the people of this Continent would be
equally at his mercy. All the forces of the land,
from Carpentaria to the Great Australian Bight,
would be under his command, and his domain
would probably also include the whole archi-
pelago, so that the dark-skinned natives of Fiji
might be enrolled to suppress the rebellious ten-
dencies of New South Wales, or the warlike
Maoris might be induced to abandon the spears
and clubs of their' forefathers and adopt the
British uniform and the British bayonet in order
to keep order in Queensland, or suppress a grow-
ing republican sentiment in Adelaide. The troops
of one colony could be used to quell the in-
cipient mutiny of another, and there exists
no central authority which could speak
with the voice of a united Australian people
against the regime of military dictatorship.
Moreover, oven in the event of a unanimous re-
fusal on the part of the proposed Australian army
to act as the instrument of the proposed English
general in Australia in suppressing national
liberty, the alien commander himself would serve
as a rallying point for Imperialism. The power
which created him would necessarily feel called
upon to support him, and the forces most readily
available for such a service would be the
Sepoys of India—the same whom the mounte-
bank Disraeli brought to Malta, not many
years ago, and whom he was on the verge
of letting loose upon distracted Europe. The one
central axiom of the Tory creed is that .the dig-
nity of the Crown must be upheld ; it was for the
sake of this principle that the dark-skinned
hordes of Hindostan were so nearly being
poured down on the desolated plains of Bul-
garia ten years ago, and the party which
t ireate-ned, in defence of its mouldy creed,
to show the Asiatics the road into Europe
would hardly hesitate to tale a similar
step in Australia,, should this country be
weak and mad, enough to accept a military
incubus which nothing but wholesale mutiny and
rebellion could ever cast off.
• •
Should Australia be inducedto hand over her mili-
tary, as well as her naval, defences to foreign
hands she will appear before the world in a new
light. The country which voluntarily entrusts
her protection to alien mercenaries is generally
regarded as beyond contempt in her weakness
and her cowardici, and the country which en-
trusts her defei.ee to England—a land which,
among the armed nations of Europe,
has became ci late years a byeword
for impotence—will have reached the lowest
depth of degradation in the eyes of foreign
powers. The protection which England extends
to her own subjects in Samoa and the other
islands of the South Seas is of such a kind that
Englishmen are insulted with impunity by every
potentate whose importance is just a little greater
than that of the imbecile ruler of Tonga, and in
South Africa the tribes over' whom she has ex-
tended her shield are raided and slaughtered by
the Dutch farmers cf the Cape, without even
an attempt at remonstrance. British pro-
tection ii a thing which, now a-dafs, even
a petty Hottentot chief would hardly sacri-
fice his independence to obtain, and t£ Aus-
tralia is ever induced to give up her liberty in
return for the shadowy benefits to be gained by
the presence of a cast-off British general, she will
surrender so much in exchange for so very little
that it will be difficult to And words with which
to define the measure of her folly. The benefits
to be derived from the act of stupendous treachery
that is now voiced abroad will be confined solely
to the grovelling Premiers who are prepared
to sell their country for a pension, and to
barter away a nation’s libsrty in return for
the privilege of dragging half the alphabet in
captivity behind their ignoble names The bar-
gain, however, is hardly worth entering upon
while titles can be bought so much more cheaply
in the European market. Less than half of the
amount now at the credit of the Parkes charity
would buy the great Hi-Ham an Italian dukedom,
and a marqu’sate c n bo obtained at an equally
modern e rate. I robably, too, a reduction
would be made upon taUcg a quantity,
and under these circumstances the cheapest
and best expedient for the Australian
people would br bo purchase a title right off for
all those Australian politicians who Cannot be in-
duced to walk straight unless their entire front
aspect is covered with decorations. At the
present moment the majority of the so-called
statesmen of Australia are grinding ceaselessly at
the Imperial barrel-organ in the hope of a reward
to follow, and the only way to meet their views is
to pay them as the or*:an grinder is paid—“not
for grind but for shut up and go away.”
PLAIN ENGLISH.
“A Paper Called ‘The Bulletin.'”
For once we regret the circumscribed scope and
limited circulation of our honoured contemporary,
the Yellow Agony, alias the Prodesthant
Sthandard. Not contented with the frantic at
tempt to advertise us on the part of the Victorian
quarantine sheet of the same name, the Sydney
organ of Orangeism and theological jaundice in a
recent issue rushes into a column of space with
the same laudable object. For once, we say, we
regret the limited circulation of the paper in
question, which attempts to sound the trumpet
blast of fame in our favour under the caption
which appears at the head of this paragraph.
Wbat, after all, would a little additional sacer-
dotal bile signify when the glory of a widely-
spread and gorgeous “ ad.” was in question? We
wildly ask, is the Editor of the Boyne Shriek
trying to get at us ? Does he want us to do him
any considerable service in the immediate future ?
His compliments are extravagant and laid on with
a journalistic trowel ; his measure of our in-
fluence touches the limits of hyperbole. After
narrating the origin of The Bulletin and in-
dulging in reminiscences of the first number, even
to a description of a cartoon “caricaturing a
member of the f ew South Wales Assembly,” and
thereby proving not only the possession of an ex-
cellent memory, but bearing witness also to the
tremendous effect The Bulletin must have had
upon his sensibilities, he says :
“The new journal was well written, and betokened the
presence of an editor with the memory of a Macaulay. It
was a success from the start, and soon made itself popular wUh
the people, rapidly gaining a wide circulation . it introduced
more pictures, put a wrapper on, doubled its price, and had
things generally its own way—one reason for this being that
Sydney wag moat wretchedly off in the way of ironic litera-
ture, for Sydney Punch was about the most dolorous at-
tempt at being funny conceivable, and the pictures in it even
worse than the reading matter."
If this is not “ jam ” of the most pronouncedly
highly-sweetened brand wo should like to know
what is ? Then the editor of the Loyal Howl
points out why The Bulletin “ had things
generally its own way,” and he does this with
that sly and rollicking humour for which parsons
and Low Church bishops are so notoriously re-
markable :
“ Any leyal Briton now taking up a copy of it will be
pained at the amount of sedition, Home Rule, and irreli-
gion the editor manages to crowd into Us columns; every op-
portunity is seized when an insult can be offered to our
Sovereign or the Prince of Wales, and the freest advantage
is taken of it to do so."
Comical dog 1 Vf hat magnificent humour ! As if
he didn’t know that it was just about impossible
to “ insult ” the Prince of Wales ! But he con-
tinues in the same side-splitting vein of Ethiopian
fun :
“ The nobility comes in for a very fall share cf sneers, and
the British Lion—representing tic British race—is con-
tinually presented in kimUialing caricature.'’
Now, does not the editor of the Quarantine
Banshee know full well that it is a matter of
utter impossibility to subject to “ humiliating
caricature ” that high and mighty British face,
with its Bible and bayonet and bludgeon, and
the secret of England’s greatness, and Oliver
Cromwell’s autograph, and WiLLIAM-of-pious-
and-immortal-memory’s sign-manual stamped all
over it ? “ But it’s only his fun,” as Caleb


Ijmmeb remarks in Dickens’ Cricket on the
arth.” Then he jogs along with more glory

ye regret, with tears welling up from unfavora-
ble depths through our larynx, that our contem-
orary has so small a circulation.
Goschen and the Golden Egg.
dR. Goschen, the Tory Chancellor of the British
exchequer, has found out that we are a very, very
tappy generation, and that the present condition
»f things is better than anything since the advent
if the first vanilla and ice cream man amid the
ihroes of tottering empires. In an address which
ie recently delivered before the Royal Statistical
Society for the advancement of universal bank-
ruptcy and the wholesa’e manufacture of divi-
lends for the children of Israel, Mr. Goschen
nade the remarkable discovery that Henry
jleorge was altogether mistaken, that wealth was
lot accumulating in the hands of a few, and that
;he theory of the correlative magnitude of pro-
mess and poverty was a dark and dismal fallacy.
[n other words, Mr. Goschen discovered that
there were more incomes in England of £2OOO per
innum and under than formerly, and that this
superior distribution of wealth was owing to the
zrowth of co operative companies, which divided
the accumulated profits of business con-
cerns amongst a greater number than in
those past days when co-operation was un-
known and business concerns were manipu-
lated by a single individual. Of course, Mr.
Koschbn’s contention is pure sophistry. The
trouble of modern sociology is not as to whether
Brown should have £20,000 per annum or a joint-
stock company representing tea Browns should
divide £20,000 per annum amongst its share-
holders. The fact still remains that there is
“profit”—value created by Labour and appro-
priated by Capital. Whether the capital is pos-
sessed by one great capitalist or 50 small ones,
it alters not the principle. Indeed, the more
rapidly Capital accumulates in the hands of the
few the better. The question can then be more
easily dealt with. If it is good that all land
should be owned by the State, it is manifestly
wrong that peasant proprietorship should be en-
couraged. It is only increasing the number of
those with whom it will be necessary some
day to deal. It is only multiplying the
holders of vested interests agreed on beep-
ing up the existing condition of things.
Similarly with the question of Labour. The pro-
letarian cares very little if the results of his
labour be filched by a single man or a company
trading as a single man. Indeed, the company is
the more callous and pitiless, representing, as it
does, the principle of transferred responsibility.
The inexorable JORKI' S is the game played con-
tinuously by the corporation, the thing which, as
Sydney smith facetiously observed, has neither a
body to kick nor a soul to damn. The incomes of
the increasing number of £2OOO per annum people
are not a subject of congratulation to the white
wage slave who receives £26 for 12 months’ work,
when work is to be had. The proletarian has
little sympathy and can be expected to have less
with the advocacy of the permanence of a con-
dition of things which simply transfers the right
to rob from the robber aristocracy to the greasy
trader. It is only a case of the fox desirous to
know of the barn-fowl what sauce he would like
to be eaten with. Labour it is which makes
“ profit ” and a continuance of a condition of
things which permits the annexation of the
results of Labour by anybody—no matter whether
big capitalist or little —who tossed to the creator
of that “profit” only a bare subsistence wage, is ini-
quitous, Goschen notwithstanding, and the school
of political economy which he is supposed to repre-
sent. The social problem is not concerned with the
distribution of the luxuries of life amongst the
already comfortably off. It worries little that
those already in possession of bread and meat and
good tweed clothing should feed on truffles and
clothe themselves in velvetsand satins while there
is such a thing as starvation in the world. The
equalisation of opportunity and the reservation
to the individual of the results of his own labour
are the questions which interest those concerned
in the amelioration of the lot of the unfortunate.
And in this connection Mr. Goschen has proved
too much against his own school. His investiga-
tion has resulted in ascribing what little ameliora-
tion there has been effected to co-operation. As-
suming this to be so, he has condemned the
system of individualism without drawing the line
where oo operation should leave off. If it, in so
limited a field of operation, has accomplished so
much, why not universally adopt it and realise
the communal principle ? Mr. Goschen, the Tory,
has all unconsciously, while advocating the doc-
trine of Conservatism, been bolding a brief for
revolution and .Social Democracy. Co-operation
pushed to its logical issue would sweep before it
everything of the brand which has hitherto
rendered the Goschbns possible.

Land nationalisation and the Crofters.
The Highland crofters are giving trouble. They
are showing that agrarian difficulties are not con-
fined to Ireland, and that land-leagueism is not
the outcome of mere racial hatred. In fact, Ire
land has received a deal of spurious sympathy to
which she is entitled not one jot. Irish rational
and denominational journals are fond of claiming
bays for Michael Davitt and curses for Henry
George, as if there were any difference in their
attitude in regard to the land. To whatever sym
pathy Ireland is entitled, it is the outcome of
broad humanitarian feeling. All the world over
similar difficulties are continually arising, and
these evoke similar interest and similar expres-
sions of sympathy. A few days since, a cable from
London announced that Lady Matheson, who
owns the Island of Lewis—a portion of the Outer
Hebrides, known as Long Island —of which she
regularly draws rentals for 350,000 acres let out
for shooting, and of which 200,000 acres are
strictly preserved, had refused to restore to the
Crofters’land League their “ ancient ” holdings
at reduced rents. Secure in her territorial rights,
she advised them “ to emigrate to the colonies.”
Then followed a timorous telegraphic surmise
that “outbreaks” were to be expected, backed
up with an assurance that a British gunboat
would proceed to the island and protect the rights
of “propitty,” or the arrogant selfishness of one
wealthy woman against thousands of starving
men, who have certainly more right to existence
than she, and whose loss would be more keenly
felt by the nation than hers. Four days after,
the “ outbreaks ” were characterised by the
electric calumniator as “ revolts,” and a
“ general rising ” was wailingly apprehended.
In due course came a line to the effect that the
“ general rising ” had eventuated and had swept
away in one fine crofter tidal-wave all the repre-
sentatives of law and order sent to arrest it. A
large body”—of crofters—“ resumed the raids
and the police attempted to stop them. A colli-
sion ensued, the result of which was that the
police were defeated and were compelled to re-
tire.” This is moderately reassuring. Provided
the crofters are martyrs enough to hold out until
the military are sent against them ; provided that
they allow a few of their number t o be shot down
or bayoneted for the good of the public
sympathy will be awakened, and they will pro-
bably get their rights— for, after all, the crofters
have “ rights ” as well as my Lady Matheson.
Lewis Island is the larger part of Long Island,
the other portion consisting of a smaller piece of
land connected to it by an isthmus. It is one of
the Outer Hebrides group. Of the Inner Hebrides
one island, viz., Skye, sent to the battlefields of
the Peninsula more fighting-men than at present
inhabit the entire island. The people of
Skye have been evicted by hundreds, and driven
away to America, and this will probably be
the fate of their neighbours if the arrogant
usurper of their property is allowed to persist in
her inhuman conduct. But this is unlikely.
Whenever the Briton perceives an injustice per-
petrated by the one upon the many, he speedily
awakens to a sense of the wrong. It
is when the wrong ■ doers are numerous
and the injustice spread over a wide
area that the average pig-headed Englishman
clamours for a continuance of vested interests in
all their innate iniquity. In the present case is to
be seen a beautiful reductio ad absurdum of the
theory of private property in land. On the one
side, a grasping woman with a second-rate handle
to her name, endeavours to dispossess and drive
into exile the old original inhabitants, whose sires
were born and died, whose children were reared,
and whose rough homes were planted in tha
rugged little isle. It is nothing to this titled
harpy that these poor fellows have cherished
traditions cf their birthplace and warm feelings of
patriotism for the old home of their fathers. She
coarsely and callously tells the to to “ emigrate in
order that she may continue to reap the rents of
320,000 acres, let out to idle sybarites and worn-
out roues , who repair to the islands to shoot and
to recupei'ate energies vitiated in nameless orgies
and midnight dissipation. Will the world, with
all its boasted philanthropy, look on while a
woman destroys a race ? Of one thing we are
assured—the crofters are of a strong-hearted and
sturdy stock who will not be driven from the land
of their ancestors without a fierce and determined
struggle. Providence is deaf now-a-days, or we
should add : May He defend the right!

“ (taking Hell with a Fine-Tooth Couih.”
When an alleged statesman describes an oppo-
nent under the pseudonym of “ Dick Turpin,
insinuates that a whilom supporter was an insig-
nificant “mole-eyed” nonenity, characterises a
harmless little individual as a person mainly
notorious for “ spread-eagle whiskers,” an ex-
traordinary face,” and the general appearance of
a “ withered tarantula” ; when this alleged
statesman denounces the general voting public as
“ crimps, thieves, and blacklegs,” and attempts
to annihilate anyone opposed to his policy with
an expression like —“ you craven-spirited, poodle-
headed, creeping creature,” we should say
that it could only be accounted for by
supposing that there was a mental break-
down in the speaker’s brain. Yet these
are the elegant formulae employed by Sir Henry
Parkes by way of expressing his dissatisfaction
on certain points with his opponents at various
times not far remote in history. Of course, these
phrases must not be taken as expressing Sir
Henry’s moral and personal estimate of those op-
posed to him. Those “ in the swim” know how
little significance is to be attached to the lofty
moral denunciations of a political partisan. These
somewhat depreciating estimates of public men
are simply assumed for the moment for the pur-
pose of stimulating the rather sluggish palate of an
audience accustomed t o energetic literary flavours
and oratorical condiments. If Sir Henry Parkes
had the power of indignant denunciati n of a
Gladstone or the been, polished satire of a Dis-
raeli, he would not be driven to characterise
his opponents by the use of expressions originated
somewhere in the back-slums. Such utterances
as those of Sir Henry’s which we have instanced,
like thoss of wranglers who exchange epithets
over pots of beer, spring from the desire to con-
vey strong meanings struggling against incapacity
ot expression, with the consequent lapse into
hacknoj ed abuse, foul language, and blasphemy.
Could those spluttering orators be suddenly en-
dowed with the gift of expression, their thoughts,
if they have any, would find vent in appropriate
language, which would be stronger that it was
their own, and was the accurate reproduction of
their sentiment. After all, party politics are a
bad school both for the mental and moral nature
ot all except the strongest. 1 he man comes in time
to believe in his own extravagant representations.
His histrionics become his nature. He sets out as
charlatan and ends as dupe. And all these com-
bined io fluences may have produced such ravages
in the never very robust intellect of Sir Henry
Parkes that he really believes all he says. There
is no necessity for writing any further on this sub-
ject. It is really a paraphrase of what the Sydney
D.T, wrote about Mr. James Fletcher, and an
expression of his regarding the present glorious
Freetrade Ministry of New South Wales, but it
fits Sir Henry Parkes and his recent election
speeches even better, so we resolved to
give him the benefit of our daily contemporary's
wit.
;
The Charity of the British Tory*
The British Primrose League has fixed up a
“minit” expressive of its sorrow that the working
classes won’t read Tory journals. The “lower
orders ” can’t afford to buy a daily paper, and the
weeklies are mostly villainous Radical produc-
tions, which teach the toiler that it isn’t neces-
sarily his duty to love the squire and his relations,
including his mother-in-law and his aunt. Con-
sequently the sons of toil are becoming demoralised
and the League has resolved to combat this pain-
ful s f ate of things by distributing the Morning
Post gratis among the homes of the poor.
“ Papers of sound Conservative and Constitutional
principles,” says this Primrose minute, “taken
and left at the very homes of the poor, would, by
being placed at the elbows of the poor man after
his daily work ” would, in short, be very
acceptable, and would lead the humble labourer
to be content with his lot. The spirit of Tory
charity has been fairly roused, and in ihe future,
when the poverty-stricken “ unemployed” re-
turns to h*s starving family, after a weary
round in hopeless search of a crust, he _ is
to be gladdened by a paper to read in which
he will find full details as to the movements
of the upper classes, and valuable particu-
lars regarding ducal entertainments and the
Archbishop of Canterbury’s lawn parties. Even
when his landlord tires him and his famished
children out of their cellar—which is frequently an
old ashpit roofed in and rented at 4 s. a week, or a
coalhole with a window'sash inserted and rags
and old hats in place of glass-panes —he may, if he
is an active and intelligent character, obtain a
Morning Post by waylaying the man who car-
ries them round for distribution, and camp under
a dry arch to read about bis blessed Queen and
the millions she has hosrded away against a rainy
day. Items of Court intelligence will also be
placed at his disposal while the bailiff is in pos-
session of his solitary room —which is bedroom,
diningroom, kitchen, and scullery all in one, with
a board, propped up at each end by two bricks,
for its entire furniture ; and when the tax-col-
lector has jumped—verbally we mean —upon
his mother because the bedridden old
female can’t pay the 2s. 2d. due for polios rates
he can fly to the columns of the gratis Tory rag
for surcease from sorrow, and peruse the Bishop’s
appeal to the poor to deny themselves and sub-
scribe for a new altar-cloth and a sacerdotal
shirt for the church of Saint Barabbas in-the
[itch. As we already remarked, the sp'rit of
charity is at last fairly arcused in the fcritish Con-
servative and the starving, toiling, suffering multi-
tude who wrestle with the dogs for a rotten bone
to save themselves from utter starvation will not
want for something to read so long as there is a
yesterday’s Tory paper in the land. The obtuse
and hungry toiler asks for bread, and the British
nobility give him a Morning Post. If he can’t
read it, he may possibly be able to eat it.

The Fydney D.T. reports that the Emperor of
China has sent presents to Sir Henry Parkes
and Mr. Burns, which action goes to show that
the sentiment of gratitude is not entirely absent
from the bosom of the Imperial Chow. The two
politicians, to whom the head idolater at Pekin
thus chuciS a bone, have fought the battle of the
yellow nightmare to the best of their ability.
'1 hey have strained every nerve to earn the grati-
tude of the unclean followers of Buddha by afford-
ing them all possible facilities for importing goods
manufactured by a dish-cloth-coloured race at the
rate of Id. a day, in order that they may undersell
the white Australian and starve him out, and the
boss unbeliever has hoard of this and is thankful.
1 he Commissioners, whom he sent to spy out the
nakedness and idiocy of the land, have returned
and (reported that New South Wales is ruled by a
big foreign devil with a shrill voice, who takes
pennies from the lepers, and says that he hasn’t
any food at home, and the Emperor therefore
sends along a little contribution in order that this
strange white man may be able to buy a bun.
Probably the ignorant Commissioners mistook the
spontaneous outpouring of a sympathetic nation
for a gigantic system of tip, and reported
to the Emperor . that it was advisable
to send the white jaw-jaw man some bucksheesh
— Chinamen are so miserably incapable of ap-
preciating the beauties of Australian institutions
that such a thing is not unlikely. Possibly they
got their ideas of the Aryan’s system of adminis-
tration from the weighing-machines at the railway
stations and explained that in Australia every
Government was built with a slit in it, and that
when a coin was dropped into this orifice the
figure would jump—it is difficult to say to what
lengths the Asiatic’s ignorance might carry him.
Perhaps poor Burns was included in the donation
because the Emperor was not certain whether he
or Parkes was the slit through which the money
had to be dropped. Anyhow, the Parkes Fund
ought to look up after this unexpected charity.
The hat has begun to circulate among the crowned
heads of the insolvent globe as well as among the
cabbage gardens of Botany, and this lends tone to
the proceedings. Even being kicked by an Em-
peror is worth something for advertising pur-
poses, and the receipt of a donation from an Em-
peror will give the Fund a greater hoist than if
Parkes had been kicked by all the monarchs of
two Continents.
V-
Will the Hon. Francis Abigail consent to
enlighten a suspicious community with some
further information concerning his 60 per cent.
“ people’s bank 1 ” Some time ago, The Bulletin
told some plain truths concerning the methods of
this peculiar institution, and Ihe Minister was
then represented by an inspired evening journal
—a fit tool for such a statesman —as being much
moved by our published revelations ; so much
moved, in fact, that he had commissioned Messrs.
Miles, Davenport, and Co. to inspect the con;
cern. It was further stated that their report
would be published, and if it was an unfavourable
one Abigail would resign his directorship.
Three months have passed since then ; but,
although the report is long overdue, it has not
been published, and Francis still hangs on to his
high-priesthood of the pawnshop as if it were his
only hope of salvation. The Bulletin, there-
fore, asks him to produce Miles, Davenport,
and Co.’s report, as nothing but afayourable certi-
ficate from some such firm could justify him in
continuing to direct a concern which the public,
upon apparently good grounds, believe to be an
instrument made for grinding the faces of Lie
poor. Should the eminent rabbit statesman be too
busy to look after this matter, we direct a similar
appeal to Mr. Hurley, M.L.A., whose name also
figures conspicuously on tbc three-ball prospectus.
And, when these two gentlemen are falling over
their own feet in their frenzied haste to produce
the report in question, they might kindly vouch-
safe an explanation upon another point. The
Australian Banking Company was formerly ad-
vertised to possess a “Reserve” amounting to
£36,718 ; The Bulletin straightly informed the
public that there was no such reserve in existence,
whereupon the Company ceased to be advertised
in the daily press as the possessor of -any such
fund. From this we presume that the long silky
ears of Abigail and of Hurley flop over in our
direction when The Bulletin utters the sorrow-
ful language of reproof. But, at the same time,
it would bo gratifying to the general public if Mr.
Abigail would explain the circumstances
which led the Company to imagine that it
possessed the said £36,718. Or, supposing the
Company was aware all along that it did not pos-
sess the money, how came it to assert that it did ?
And if it claimed, in this instance, to own a largo
sum which had no existence, many affluent citi-
zens would be glad to know if the other figures in
the balance-sheet were made up on the same
liberal principle. Or, supposing that the £36,718
in question ever was a reality, where has it gone
to, and is there any chance that tbe other assets
of the Bank may go to the same place ? The
public are waiting an answer to these queries,
and it is time for that promised certificate to
hurry up.

The annual report of the Deaf and Dumb Institu-
tion at Darlinghurst, Sydney, shows that the
great art and mystery of grovel is not entirely
neglected at that establishment. In addition to
a lar.e stock of refreshing information on various
subjects, this volume contains a number of speci-
mens of composition in which “ the horse,” “ the
lion,” and other subjects are treated in a way
which would surprise these animals, and further
on we drop across a few biographical sketches
dealing with King Solomon, William Beach,
Henry the Second, and —O what a fall is there —
Henry Parkes. Concerning this Grand Old
Mistake one unhappy little boy is made to
write ;
Sir Henby Parkes was bom in England, 27th May, 1815.
His parents were not veiy rich, hence his early education
was United. When a young man, he became a writer for a
newspaper in Sydney. Previous to this he was in business,
but he liked books and literary work better than business.
He has helped to make good laws for New South Wales. He
compelled the publicans to close the hotels on Sundays. He
origioated our Education Act. He can make fine speeches.
He is the cleverest statesman of Australia. He is a tall and
stout old gentleman. He is 72 years of age. He is our Pre-
mier. He is loyal to England, and very patriotic. He is not
rich, but we hope the people will raise enough money to
gratify him and free his mind from anxiety. He would re-
fuse Government money, but we hope he will not refuse a
handsome gift from the people of New South Wales. Long
may he be spared !
It -would be interesting to learn who stuffed this
miserable infant to make him tout for the Parkes
charity. Not long ago the blind were hauled out
of their refuge to raise half-crowns for the Queen’s
Fund, and now the deaf and dumb are called into
service to raise the wind for the Object of Hair,
strangely enough, however, Parkes and Beach
are pretty nearly the only individuals who get
pleasant biographies. Thomas A’ Beckett, for
instance, ia polished off thus :
“ Thomas A Beckett was a learned and artful man who
pretended to be religious. Henry 11. pretended to be sorry
at the death of A’Beckett ”
We would like to know wlat would have been
tbe fate of the boy who wrote anything like that
about Parkes ? Would he have got his head
punched, or what ?
The present New South Wales Government,
judging from its Centennial projects, is a pain-
fully animal combination, and, true to its instincts,
it has planned out a purely cart-horse show to
celebrate the hundredth anniversary of the
colony. There is a liberal vote to provide for a
tremendous feed for those who are already
apoplectic and overfed, but there is no prize for a
historic painting to commemorate the occasion.
There is a Centennial hog exhibition on the pro-
gramme, but no Centennial poem, and the old re-
gatta business is down on the list, but the idea of
founding a University scholarship, so that the
rising generation may not have to go down on all
fours to look for their dropped “ h’s” as their
parents have to do, does not appear to have oc-
curred to anybody concerned. Parkes, himself,
when in England, used to follow Tennyson and
other literary men round like a huge Newfound-
land dog, but fince then his love of literature
seems to have died away. Perhaps Tennyson
sat on him.

Nothing is too illogical and absurd for the Tory
Ministers to say, and the Tory and Unionist
people to swallow, in the justification of coercion.
Lord Salisbury, in his last “ great ” harangue,
declared to applause and cheers :
‘‘Let the minority be heard —let them be heard abun-
dantly-let them be heard to whatever extent is necessary
to place their opinions thoroughly befoie the people of this
country: but when mincrities have been heard, let the
majority decide."
Well, dropping the quest ion of the majority in
England, and whether the “ masses ” don’t wholly
outnumber the cocrcionist “classes,” not even the
most Gou-forsakon numskull who is proud to call
himself a Conservative ever denied which way the
majority went in Ireland. Toryism confutes
itself, but is too stupid to see it.

When tbe New South Wales Naval Forces BUI
becomes law, and a cracked and gouty fleet ia
hovering round tbe coast of New South Wales,
there ia every prospect of a considerable fall in
tha value of water frontage allotments. Tie
pitent self-bursting gurs of the navy, by virtue
of which Britannia’s march is o’er tbe mountain
waves and her home upon the deep, are death
upon wateriida villas, and are liable, at any
moment, to blow the head off the uncfferd’ng
stranger who loafs upon the wave beat shore.
For instance, ore pleasant day last summer the
wart hip Ajax was lying off the quiet little
Scottish town of Inellan. It was a calm, still
afternoon; the blue waters were glassy In their
smoothness ; a single, solitary crab walked side-
ways on the sandy beach, and no one dreamt of
approaching evil. Then, suddenly, the Aj->x
threw two shells into the infant school, where tbe
rising generation were wrestling with the four
rules of arithmetic, and nearly tore a pretty girl-
teacher into shivers, and a moment later a whole
bro id side was sent into a row of villas on the shore.
The childrf n fled, the local policeman became
afflicted with scarceness, the bailie lighted out
for the hills, and the minister went out to re-
mons'rate under the impression that Inellan
had somehow incurred the wrath of the Crown,
and that he must bear the olive-branch of peace.
The First Barnacle of the Admiralty, however,
explained the matter In Parliament ; something
had happened to the “electric circuit,” and the
guns had gone off when nobody was looking.
Pr-’-bablv some day a shell will explode between
Parkes’ legs from the same comprehensive cause
and the Post office tower will be thrown in tha
street, and then Now South Wales will either
have to pay the self-bursting fleet to go away, or •
Sydney will have to be removed bodily Into the
backwoeds for security.
John Cathie, of Ballarat (Vic.), was the
first undertaker who sat In an Australian Parlia-
ment. When Parliament opened, Cathie put on
his professional black clothes and took his seat
in what he called the 'Ouse. During the first
pause in the proceedings, he elevated himself and
excitedly blurted out that “it would be a
very good thing for the country If the mem-
bers and supporters of the Government were all
dead.” Then up ro;e Aspinall, with one of bis
cynical smiles, and retorted, “Good thing for
you, you mean; you might get the job of burying
them.” And then Cathie fell back with the sigh
of a man who had just been rapped over the head
with the shin bone of a pirate’s corpse.

HISTORY OF BOTANY BAY.
In coming to Australia, therefore, it will
be seen, as the philanthropic Mr, Eden prophesied,
that “ the devoted convict was not seated for life
on a bed of roses.” Enough has been said to show
that of all the vile spots on the earth, Botany-
Bay was the vilest —always with a reservation In
favour of Norfolk Island and Van Dleman’s Land,
which will receive attention in their proper places.
The consequence was that the convict was dis-
s itisfled with the maternal provision the mother-
country had made in his regard, and was even
known, on repeated occasions, to endeavour to
make his escape.
* * *
Nothing can be more miserable than the
records of these attempts. They took various
forms—sometimes attempted mutiny, sometimes
flight by sea, and some-dmes flight by land. In
the very first year of colonisation, an attempt of
the last-mentioned kind was made. The despera e
convicts had heard from the blacks a wild tala to
which thair own hopas gave the colouring. Soma
500 miles to the south-west, they gathered, there
was a city of white men. A plan was
formed to brook away from the settlement, and
iourney on until this storied city was
reached. It was a kind of convicts’ Hy-
Brasil—that fabulous island on the waters that
appeared for a moment to the eyes of old-time
visionaries, and “flamed, and flashed, and passed
away." The convicts’ hope was just as illusory.
Sixteen of them were captured and brought to
Sydney, and under the influence of a merciless
flogging, the wild hope seems to have evaporated
for a time. Four convicts were allowed to go
with four soldiers to see if there was any truth In
the report of the white men’s city. In ten days
three returned, and the fourth 23 days later. He
brought nothing back except a bird of Paradise,
and, strange to say, we have no record of this
man being flogged. But it showed the dreamers
that their hope was a vain one, and it left them
to their despair. The settlement was a prison as
strongly secure as though id were girdled by
strong stone walls and iron bars. As he entered
the Heads, the convict might read the fatal sen-
tence that Dante read over the gates of Hell,
“All ye who enter here, abandon hope ! ’
* * *
Thera is a story of a convict fi-hetman
named Bryant which is as romantic as Robinson
Crusoe, and dramatic as Monte Cristo. He
was engaged in fishing for the supply of the settle-
ment, and while so engaged the desperate hope
came to him to make his escape in his fishiag-boat
and so return to England with his wife and two
children. It is touching to read these instances
of a kindly domestic feeling amonget the
cruelly-outraged victims of thosa social laws
which lead to ignorance as well as to crime. He
spoke to the master of a Dutch vessel, which
brought provisions to the colony from Batavia.
The honest Dutchman seems to have sympathised
with the poor fellow’s natural desire for liberty.
He gave him a compass, quadrant, and chart,
and such Information as he could. Bryant men-
tioned his project to seven o'hers, and when alt
was ready they put some provisions with Bryant’s
wife and children into the boat, and so set sail.
They suffered horribly on the voyage, but still
they kept bravely on in their little craft. Oae
man was drowned in the Straits of Sunda, but
the rest actually succeeded in reaching Timor,
and then Batavia But, alas for the vanity of
these poor wretches’ hopes ! Bryant and one of
his children, with two of the convicts, died here
after all their perils passed, but at least they ob-
tained their liberty. Not so the others. The
Ditch Government at Batavia arrested them, and
afterwards handed them over to H.M S. Pandora.
No touch of nature shows through the whole of
this melancholy ousineas, except what we find in
the conduct of these convict waifs. The Pandora
took them round the Cape to England, where they
were tried and committed to Newgate, un il the
term of their original sentences had expired.
The convict period has many weird stories, but no
more like this.
Then the convicts became posse sei with
the idea that they would reach China by travel-
ling overland. Successive parties made their
escape, and set out with that intention. Four
convicts were found la the bash near Port Ste-
phens in 1795 ; they mafe their escape from
Parramatta five years before. In 1791, 20 male
and female conviots started to walk to < hlna.
Some of them died in the bash, and others ware
brought back In the last stages of starvation.
Fiji was flrsa ciloaised by eioaped prisoners, who
copied, as far as possible the e, the barbarism
their gaolers had taught them at Botany Bay.
Toe fi at meatioi o! gold la Australia was made
by an escaped prisoner. He ask ad for the free-
dom of himself and a femal t prisoner as his re-
ward for the discover/. Two soldiers ware sent
with him to see the spot, and he took the oppor-
tunity to make his escape. His gaolers ware very
much dlsapoolntad at his infidsiity to his engage
raent, and when they caught him they expostu-
lated with him severely—with a “ oat.” This
improved his moral perceptions, and he again
volunteered to enrich his torturers. Their greed
led them into the cunning trap again, but they
soon caught this farceur , and he confessed that
the gold he showed in the first Instance was made
out of two gold rings and a brass button. This
quite disgusted the officials. Th?y flogged him
again, and so we hear no more of him. Yet some
day he will get a statue, too.
• * •
The daily “ muster ” was es abliahed to
keep a cheek on the convicts who were so fond of
running away. Different districts had different
times for master, but the persons for whoso bene-
fit this thoughtful institution w devised took such
astute advantage of that circumstance, that a uni-
form hour was appoint'd, and an order issued, in
1801, which said : Any pen on not appearing at
the General Musters will be taken up r s vagrants
(sic) and punished to the utmost rigour of the
law, it free ; and if a prls mor, will be sent mead
to one month’s cmfinement in the But ry
Gang.” In 1816 an esoap.ng convict, w.io was
hard pressed, reported him elf to a constable as
absent without leave. Tnis active and Intelligent
officer gave him a good dinner, and then wont on
to t»ke him before a magistrate. But the ocher
man held other vie vs. His benefactor's beet had
demoralised him. He therefore fitted that good
man up in his arms and threw him into the river.
Then he ran rapidly away.
Many an anxlou eye tamed with sicken-
l ng hope to that far away line of dim blue hills,
seen in the distance from Sydney, in those early
days. An idea gained ground that a nation of
white men dwelt beyond, and not ad the stories of
Prestar John together exercised suoh a fatal fas-
cination as this alluring fable. The Governor said
this notion was “ unfounded, wicked as it is false,
and calculated to bring the believers of It to de-
struction." So lb did. He is always a
good prophet who can secure the fulfil-
ment of his own propheoy. A good many
died in making the attempt to pass the mountains,
and a good many were flogged within an inch of
the same result when they were caught. A con-
vict explorer, named Wilson, says he saw the
skeletons of 50 runaway prisoners on the road to
the Blue Mountains. In 1802 a case is mentioned
of some escapees who had got to the Nepean
River, others to the coast, while the rest of the
party “ had wandered about near the place they
had left, after being absent about ten days, most
of them nearly starved, and living on grass for
five days oat of the ten.” Another party was
subsequently sent out to see if the Chinese really
were located within measurable distance to the
northward. A vaguely described “copper-
coloured people” were also searched for. A boat’s
crew accidentally picked up these explorers in aspot
where they had been for nine days, and “ where
they mu-t soon have perished but for this miracu-
lous event. They were brought back almost ex-
hausted for want of food.”
* * *
Quite frequently attempts were made to
seize ships or boats. In 1797 the “ Cumberland ”
was seized by convicts, a d the Venus, belonging
to Robert Campbell in 1799, and again, or one of
the same name, in 1806. In 1808 the Harrington
was taken out of the harbour by convicts, but
H. M. S, Phoenix captured her in the Indian seas.
However, they got another chance, as she
was wrecked soon after on the Laconian
coast, and all the convicts escaped or perished.
The Unity was captured in 1813, and tbe Trial in
1816. The latter was wrecked, and her escapees
drowned or killed by the natives. The William
Csesar was taken in 1817, and the Isabella in 1823.
This last has never been heard of since. As late
as 1853, 22 convicts on their way from Van Die-
man’s Land to Norfolk Island, seized the Lady
Franklin, kept the vessel for 11 days, and then
loaded the boats with provisions, and left. The
murderer Knatchbull was the h°ro of such an
attempt in 1832, but it did not succeed, and Mr.
Knatchbull lived to serve out his sentence on
Norfolk Island and come back to Sydney and
be hanged. Bass, in his journal—to return
to the period of this part of our story—
found seven poor wretches marooned on one
of those forbidding rooks in Bass’s Strait.
They had been away eight months, and seven
others who had escaped with them had treacher-
ously left them here to parish. They wanted to
travel northward “ to throw themselves on his
Majesty’s mercy.” They forgot that the gentle-
men who represented his Majesty had no
mercy. Bass could not take them away, as his
boat was too small, but he gave them a musket
and some ammunition, a compass, and soma fish-
ing-lines. Two were ill, and these he took into
his boat. The rest he landed on the mainland,
and they started on their long walk back to Botany
Bay. “ When they parted with Mr. Bass and his
craw who gave them what clothes they could
spare,” says the story, “some tears were shed on
bath sides.” An honest tench of nature, this.
• *
Although it does not properly belong to
this part of our story, this is, for many reasons, a
fitting place to do justice to the memory of one of
the few men who ever showed a human sympathy
with these forlorn convict wretches. When tjie
reader is sickened by the rapacity and cruelty of
the New South Wales Corps, and the gaolers of
the penal settlement generally, he may turn for
refreshment to the name of Colonel Collins. “His
conduct was exemplary, and his disposition most
humane. His treatment of the runaway convicts
was conciliatory, and even kind. He would go
into the forests, among the natives, to allow these
poor creatures, the runaways, an opportunity of
returning to their former condition And, half-
dead with oo’:d and hunger, they would come and
drop on their knees before him, imploring pardon
for their behwionr.” He would give them food
and clothing, and send them back to their work.
At this time Colonel Collins was Governor of Van
Dieman’s Land. But he died.
The town of L’verpeol (N.S.W.) is going to cen-
tmniate in a fashion that is painful in its origin-
ality. Mr. Charles Bull is to deliver an
oration, and this being completed—
Britannia will than ascend the throne—New South Wales
on her right hand, Governor Phillip on her left-hand—
with Captain Cook and King Tommy. Britannia will then
ask Ciptain Cook to report his discoveries, and afterwards
appoint Captain Phillip, R.N., first Governor of the
colony.
After giving Phillip a billet to boss the lags, the
entire caboodle sing “ Rule Britannia,” and the
chief effigy confers the honour of Knighthood on
ten boys of the district. Thus are they taught in
their green and tender youth to squirm and grovel
to a foreign power, 16,003 miles away, for sham
tinsel distinctions, and then we wonder why we
are not a nation with a frigid back-bone and a
stiff upper-lip. Pass the centennial whisky and
let us do a genuine colonial salaam !
Bishop Moorhouse elevates his vocal organ in
the howling wastes of Manchester to state that
“ the best way of making the distribution of
money more beneficent would be to give to all
men a greater share in the possession of land and
capital.” This sentence is one with which we
believe everyone will agree, and we move that
the Bishop should at once bring in a Bill to that
effect. If he can give a lot more land and a lo r ,
more money to everybody , without taking any-
thing from anybody, he will give this world a lift
for which it will bs grateful. Bat where the
fatted Bishop is to get the land and the money
from is not fully explained. At present there is
not enough unclaimed soil on the face of the earth
for an Anarchist’s dog to sit down upon, and the
unclaimed money all goes to the Queen or some-
body. Consequently, when Moorhouse starts to
enrich “ all men” with gold and territory we are
a f raid he will be reduced to giving the globe his
bill at three mon hs. Somehow, the ( huroh
doesn’t seem to be of much use In an emergency.

CORRESPONDENCE
The Horsebreaker : If you could have put a few
airy lies into that buah missionary incident, it might have
become interesting, hut you seem to adhere too closely to
the realm of melancholy fact.,. .Incogniti: We are sorry to
hear that you are tired of the sight of the great African
Desert of Parkes’ countenance in The Bulletin, When
that apostle of good government is ejected from the N.S.W.
Parliament and compelled—in the language of the gutter—
to “ dry up ” in politics, we will give him an eternal rest....
Ecce Homo (Narrandera); (1) The rumour you mention
started, we believe, in one of the Government offices in
Sydney. Only another empty weapon. (2) “ England must
win because she has the money,” is an old story. Croesus
had the money, too, but Cyrus, who hadn’t a cent, won and
took the lot. Old Blucher sized up the wealth of London 70
years ago. “Mein Gott, what a city to plunder !” was what
he said... .T.H.W. (Albury): Is it this verse in Langfoid’s
volume of soft slush which rouses you to such fury ?
“ Pew cities in the ancient world
Can more attractive suburbs boast
Than Melbourne, still in infancy,
B Ah inland or along her coast;
Where many pleasant days we passed,
Whose memory will ever last.”
Well, we have seen a paper-hanger’s “ ad." which contained
more genuine poetry, but it would be too rough to publish
your reply, all the same. Too much like hitting a man who
is already flat....P. Johnston: Verses very good in spots,
but too mysterious altogether. The unlettered public
wouldn’t know what you werp driving at... .Trombone : We
don’t wish to east doubts on the originality of the yarn, but
the same story has happened once or twice before in various
parts of the habitable g10be,,.,A B. (Rockhampton): Po-

wants to be treated with light and airy profanity to do it
justice. ...O.V.C. : Your ideas of rhyme are less coherent
than a hog’s views upon Sunday S.F.T. (Ooulhurn): We
cannot make head or tail or middle of your paralytic note.
—. The Finder of This (Sydney): If, as you say, you found
the poem about the Sunday-school teacher, you made a poor
haul. Don’t find any more like it. ...Subscriber (Campaina,
Tas.): Your hypocrite is an animal of purely local interest,
and, anyhow, what is one hypocrite among so many?....
Croydon Creek (Q,): Only the bilious ass of a compositor
again. Nothing more....Fossicker (Croydon, Q): Thanks

Beatrice Laura (Sydney): We like stuffed-dog poetry, but
not such as this

Not know your pet did die.
To wake me thou canat never do,
Ever faithful kind and true :
Since thirteen years I lived for you
To nobly let me die.
The dog could have written better stuff than that with his
tail Cerberus (Albury): Your last “Reflections "don't
come within miles of your p-eviona contributions, and the

to this and then perish :
The fire crackled on the tidy hearth,
Its flare lit up the gloom ;
His baby brother crowed in infant mirth,
And crawled about the room.
Shade of the departed Pomcey, what do you call that ?
W.W.H. (Wagga); The Bulletin does not profess to sup-
port Henry George's theories all through. For instance,
George lays down the axiom that if Freetrade is good in one
case it is good in all, to which we are inclined to reply that
if three years gaol and two floggings suit one man they
don’t necessarily suit all the rest of humanity
Land Nationalisation and Protection are part of
the same cause. Freetrade is making Austra-
lia more and more dependant on Britain, and is swamping the
colonies with British landlords, and with mercantile houses
which are merely branch agencies of London firms, until
there is a prospect that in the near future foreign interests
will become sufficiently powerful to block the road of pro
grass. Protection helps to make a country self-dependant,
and we therefore regard it as a step towards Land Nationali-
sation. If you think this estimate of British influence over-
rated, look at Egypt, which is now run in the interests of the
speculators of London, and ask yourself what show a land
reformer working in the interests of the Egyptian peasantry
would have n0w....A Borrower of The Bulletin: We
aren’t any good at conundrums, and our columns are closed
for ever against jokes about licking the new twopenny
stamps....Sylvanus (Ballina): Thanks for screed re Wales’
vanished hair.... Mac. (Dunedin): The present writer has
had the pleasure of personally knowing Mr. Fish of old As
to the subject you mention, an article treating it was io type
when your letter came tu hand Thanks for your good-
wishes. .. .Cockney (Sydney): It is hard to advise you. The
ways of the publishers are past finding out. Yon have a
hotter show with prose than verse, anyhow. Try the frater-
nity one by one. They may publish for you without any
prepayment; it all depends On the merits of the work..,.
Albanich (Rye Park): Many thanks for good wishes. We
get most of the papers you mention, however....Rienzi;
Will fix our eye on your article next week....HAW.
(Sydney): Letter re Centenary would have been acceptable
if it had only arrived a week earlier. Your sentiments are
oura. Bust this great anniversary of “The Day We Were
Lagged." F. Stephen :We know of no English translation
of Karl Marx's work. Read Lawrence Groclund’s " Co-
operative Commonwealth,” which will supply you with all
the information you require. (2 ) Land Nationalisation is
a dream which will one day be realised all the world over.
Protection is a step towards it, despite the howl of scorn
with] which the Freetrader greets the assertion. So is
Trades Unionism.
George Brown, of Omaha Flats (N.Z.),
organised an elaborate snioide a few days ago.
He piled up a heap of combustibles round his hut
and set them on fire, and then sat down on a
quantity of dynamite inside and exploded himself.
Part of Brown came flying out, and marly hit a
passer-by on the head, but his logs have not been
found, and it is supposed that they were scattered
into the next province and eaten by a wild hog.
Sands’ Sydney Directory for 1888 is now
published, and Is, if possible, a little better than
the issues which preceded it. It contains every
kind of information that any civilised Aryan
householder could ask for, and, despite the gene-
rally acknowledged fact that a directory can
hardly keep up to the standard of a three-volume
novel for thrilling interest, we regard this publi-
cation as much more entertaining than many cur-
rent works of fiction. If it were dramatised by
an able pen it would undoubtedly be 'superior to
more than one play which now occupies the boards
in Sydney.
The Referee
“We see Jack Burke is paying a flying
visit to the colonies. We wonder how long lb
will be before he arranges a draw ?” Sa said an
American paper, and Burke’s actions this side of
the line go far to show that the writer of the
quoted par. was nob far out when he at tributed
to Burke more of the showman than the fighter.
From the long- tailed-banger and tali glossy hat in
which he jumped ashore, to the desperate shark
adventure he met with a couple of days before
the fight, all was “ad.” ; then he turned dog on
his forefathers, and declared himself an Ameri-
can ; and when Peter Jackson was trotted out to
him he didn’t like the look of the sable giant, and
declared it was infra, dig. for an American boxer
—which, by the way, he is not— to meet a coloured
man, a piece of bunkum in the face of the fact
.that Yankee Kilrain, who recently fought Eng-
lishman Smith for the championship of the world,
fought a desperate battle quite recently with one
Godfrey, an American black. It was then that
Larry Foley, who years ago had retired from active
service in the ring, stepped into the breach and
consented to meet the Englishman rather than
give him the further “ad.” of saying that a white
man could not be found to cope with him In New
South Wales. Larry Immediately set to work
and wrestled manfully with the adipose tissue
which encumbered him, and when he stepped
into the ring at the Carington Grounds on Mon-
day last he faced Burke with a broad grin and a
much narrowed bingey. The fight was nob worth
description. Foley, if anything, had the best of
the first two rounds, but in the third Burke took
the lead, and at the termination Larry was a bit
weak. Foley was all right when the fifth was
called on, and from that out not a blow worthy of
the name was struck till time was played out
and the men shook hands. Burke’s show with
an old man who, years ago, retired from the
ring was of the poorest kind, and if the per-
formance can be taken as any criterion of Yankee
and British form, in the writer’s opinion Peter
Jackson could sweep the world, Sullivan included.
Anyway, our sable champion is the only man in
Australia Burke can hope to build up his very
muoh shattered boxing reputation with, and if be
now refuses to meet Jackson, h’s chance of again
drawing a big gate on his John L. Sullivan repu-
tation has flown, and his occupation as a boxer is
gone in Australia. Ten years ago La-ry Foley
would have knocked him out in a couple of
rounds.
“ Professor ” We t made rather a mistake
in tackling Mick Dooley at Foley’s, on Saturday
night. Mick, to all intents and purposes, knocked
the Professor out in a round, but he was allowed,
on sufferance, to come out for a second, when
Dooley humanely declined to strike the beaten
man, and induced his friends to take him away.
It is of use any but first-class men tackling
Dooley. * Amongst the Sydney boxers Dooley plays

When the Burke-Foley show was over
last Mi-nday, probably the worst disgusted man
in Australia was Larry himself. He cast one
withering glance on iha alleged boxer who was to
have made catsmeat of him in one act, and said
scornfully, “Why don’t he come down to my
place any morning, before breakfast, and I’ll fight
him for love with naked fiscs? ’ Meanwhile Black
Jackson was howling' at the top of his voice for a
match with any white trash from any part of the
globe, bnt Burke apparently did not hear him.

we have waited long for this blessed consumma-

bounders continue to shove the old ark of this
tragedy along, and tell ns over and over again
about the long-haired flat of a female who left her
husband to flee with a parody on the human race
with a long bell-topper balanced on one side of his

a listening world will hear something drop.

Some years after Parkes went bung for
the second time, a red-headed crank who lived in
a little village on the Darling wrote a drama in
about 11 acts. Ho put this thing away in a
•candle-box and it remained there for some time
without doing any haim, but the other day it
•came to light. A mouldy theatrical company was
living on husks in the back-blocks, and while the
■manager was roaming at large, he and the author
concussed against each other and planned a fell
■design against the unoffending public. They
reduced the drama to seven acts, and produced it
n all its conglomerated horror to an audience of
17. As the manager himself observed to the
leading gentleman who hadn’t any socks, You
need to pile the hagony up ’igh to fetch the
awjence,” and the leading gentleman concurred
and the agony was piled. There was a murder in
the first act, also a trial and a gallows, a duel,
■and a woman raahiug all over the drama with her
hair down and a marriage certificate concealed in
her stocking, and an incriminating letter hidden
■down her back. In the next act there was a felo-
nious dog and abody-snatcher without any legs, and
the third showed a ghost, a beautiful girl tied to a
tree, a railway accident, a public-house fight. and a
whale. Act four contained an innocent child with a
■stutter ; he was seized by the police and £ll,OOO
in gold was found hidden In his boots. The com-
pany had been steadily growing drunk all this
while, however, and it was found impossible to
produce any more acts because the leading man
was asleep in his dressing-room, and the principal
juvenile was struggling with the -howling cham-
bermaid for the possession cf a bottle The author
went round and raved at them, but they dropped
him down a trap and it took him two hours to find
■his way out. When begot clear at last he mounted
his horse and lighted out fo: his home beside the
■creak with the dead calf in it, and there is now
■one dramatist *he less in a per. ecuied land. Quits
•a number of authors are still going about loose
who were obviously built to chase the artful hog
from his lair, but there is joy in Heaven when
■even one of the fraternity discovers his own defi-
ciencies and goes back to his childhood’s haunts to
scare the native bear.

The only Melbourne novelty, “ Missing at
Lloyd's," contains as much shipwreck and broad
expanse of ocean as can be accommodated on the
Opera House stage. Sometimes the waves gently
break upon a shingly shore with mechanical
monotony, and at other times they are lashed into
fury by unseen agencies at the wings, but in
either case the wild waste of waters suggests
careful management and a liberal expenditure of
ready money. The drama itself is a loose -jointed,
sprawling piece of work ; the company unfold
their plot with undue pomposity and cir-
cumstance, but, nevertheless, an odour of
brine from the ocean is wafted over
the footlights with pleasing results. All the
trouble is caused through three men being mashed
on one pale, unsubstantial female in a limp frock.
The first favourite among these sighing suitors
appears to be a virtuous sea captain (there are
such individuals —in dramas), so the despised out-
siders compass his destruction, the one by sendlrg
him to America in an aged ship, and the other by
punching holes in its hull Sundry tableaux In-
form the spell bound audience that the capta n
and his other girl float about on something
until a brig picks them up, and a long,
lean, last act is composed of hornpipes
and retribution. The captain realises that
his other girl has a truer heart than the
vague shadow in a limp frock, while the villains
are either killed or handcuffed by the re-
morseless law. Of the acting in “ Missing at
Lloyd’s ” it would be dangerous to speak in terms
of undiluted praise. A dread of something
coming after death compels us to say that Mias
Helen Vivian has swallowed Carrie Swain with-
out quite digesting that charmer’s peculiar
method, also that the limp-frooked morsel
of unsubstantial insincerity requires nerv-
ing up. Port wine, sal-volatile, and lav-
ender-water mixed would make quite another
gal of her. Messrs. W. G. Carey, Keogh,
Power, and Bateman are well up to their work,
and Miss Beatrice Lyster puts intelligent agility
into a soubrette part. A gentleman named Jordan
plays the masher villain in a style of his own, but
the brightest side of Jordan, unhappily, can never
be seen In this life. Taking it altogether, the
chances are that “ Missing at Lloyd’s” would flu
the Opera House moderately for another fortnight
if Mr. T. A. Kennedy hadn’t engaged the theatre
for a display of mesmerism commencing on Satur-
day, Why this should be is best understood of
the proprietors.

An American masher got Into Minnie

The sprightly soubrefcte was on the stage, and I had plenty
f time to look round. It was a white candy-box of a room,
found myself reflected in two mirrors. Under a flaring gas-
et sat a prim maid and a big policeman The maid sewed,

irecious jewels. Here and there I noticed open trunks, and

Miss Connie Gilchrist is coining to Aus-
tralia with Nellie Farren and Cos. Connie accord-
ing to legend, was orginally a barmaid, but she
took to the boards, and a dnke got mashed on her
and followed her about till she became famous.
There aren’t any dukes in Australia. Mrs. Ber-
nard Beere has invented anew mode of dying on
the stage. She takes poison and bounds from a
table to a sideboard, from that to a straight-
backed chair, then rushes against a sofa and
drives her spine hard on to the back of it, and
finally totters from the sofa to the centre
of the stage, where she passes away. In
a certain Sydney theatre an author can
be heard almost every night in the week applaud-
ing his own drama till he is so exhausted that he
can hardly stand. “ Macduff s Cross," a one-act,
one-horae tragedy which is sinfully ascribed to Sir
Walter Scott, has been produced for the first time
in London. Two gentlemen of Scotch but honest
parents, argue considerably in it, and then there
is a lot of slaughter. “ Mexican Joe," another
individual who bathes only occasionally, is run-
ning another “ Wild West" hippodrome in Eng-
land. More cowboy. At Christchurch (N.Z),
George Leitch could only secure one able bodied
male white tax payer with decently straight! legs
to represent the army returned from the Soudan,
as shown in “ Human Nature." The poor wreck
had to be horse, foot, and artillery all combined
The Giant Family are still on exhibition In
Sydney, and are growing fatter every day. The
horse that could carry the leading lady of this
combination is not yet built. Carrie Swain Is

Chinamen congregate, Edith Brandon, a pretty

to the departure of a man named Jackson for the

It has been noted that when an old man
drops a sovereign in the gutter and the policeman
who is standing by won’t help him to look for it,
the reason generally is that the policeman is
standing on the sovereign and doesn t want to get
off it till the old man goes away.
On Christmas Day a man in Wellington
(New Zoaland) thought he would give his best
“ gell ” a little surprise, so he sharpened up his
long disused razor and shaved off his beard and
whiskers. He took cold, which changed into
pleurisy, and his address is now Hades-on-the-
Styx, or else Kingdom-Come-we don't know
which.
Everybody recollects the gibe about the
German who knocked up a chemist at the dead of
night for an emetic for his wife, and being asked
if the patient was a child or an adult, replied that
to the hast of his belief she was an “ adulteress.
This by wav of the fact that the Sydney
Daily Telegraph heads a centennial article
with the caption “Australia Adulta." We do
not intend to explain the profundity of this joke.
In view of recent little Imperial flirtations on the
part of colonial statesmen this ought to be imme-
diately apparent.
“Picturesque New Guinea,” by J. W.
Lindt F.R.G.S., is a book with green boards and
weigbing.about 2lb. It contains much valuable
information regarding the island which Sir
Thomas MU wraith vainly attempted to jump on
behalf of the British lion, but, judging from the
number of gentlemen whom the author thanks in
his preface for information supplied and chapters
contributed, the real paternity of the volume
seems rather dubious. The illustrations, how-
ever are magnificent works of art, and they
alone should be sufficient to make the book a
success.
Patting it mildly, quail-upon-toast is a
dish that cannot be had at all the best hotels in
this colony. In point of fact, many of these
Arcadian palaces seem to t r ust to tinned sardines,
and fried green-hide halters (pssred off as bacon),
with an occasional egg, to supply travellers’ wants
all the year round. Only tbe other day a gentle-
man who had journeyed a considerable distance
in the mallee country, and had still further
to go puffed up at a wayside pub, familiarly
known as “The One Eye,” and
after seeing that his horses were
fed, asked the landlord if he could
have some dinner at once, as
he was anxious to take the road
cnee more. The enterprising
caterer for the public, hearing this
request, dug his hands into his
trousers pockets, and replied,
“ Wal, we’ve nuthin’ in th’ house
jest now, but if you'll wait till th’
boys kim 'ome, I'll send ’em out to
run down a rabbit and we’ll cook
it for yer. Rabbits is dam good eat in’, if they re
fat, I tell yer.” The traveller passed on.
“Do it, and be damned!” said John
Dunne to the magistrate at the Flemington (Vic.)
Police Court, when they threatened to commit
him for contempt, and then, fearing the Bench
might not comprehend the breadth, depth, and
general massiveness of his scorn, he proceeded to
further fulminate his sentiments in choice, bul-
lock-puncher’s idiom, and he whacked a constable
on the nose with a thud like the kick of a cart-
horse. John’s masterly summing-up carried con-
viction with it—he got seven days.
The other day a Melbourne Supreme Court
Judge, when an unsavoury case was about to be
heard, ordered all boys a nd women to leave the court.
One sturdy female, however, peremptorily re-
fused to budge from the gallery, and defied
M'Donald, the crier. The late Justice Sir Rad-
mend Barry had a more effective mode of scaring
the women away. One day his associate re-
quested “all females to withdraw.” Half-a-
dozen still remained. “Tell all respectable
females to leave the court,” whisper and Sir Red-
mond. The associate did so, and the fair ones
tumbled over each < ther trying to get out through
the crowd.
Colonel Barker, of the Melbourne Harmy,
has been authorised to arrest, without warrant,
any child, apparently under the age of 16, found
residing in a giddy domicile Armed with this
elastic power, the “Colonel” should be able to
recruit soma very fascinating Salvation lassies,
and we think he’s a lucky man entirely. It ought
to be easy work, too, it he puts on his full Salva-
tion regimentals, because girls, apparently under
16, dote on the military something awful.
Which reminds us that Barker has been pub cn to
the good work by the Governor-in-Council. Sir
Henry Loch evidently understands all this, for he
used to be a soger himself.
The Queensland poet Is apparently ad-
vancing backwards, and he dally leaves a fainter
footprint with his wooden head upon the sands of
time. The latest sufferer by hfs muse Is a
country editor named Duncan Mao Master
Cameron, and this is the way his enemy has
served him up—
Pibroch of Duncan Mac,
Master Cameron;
Help him to arch his back,
Urge the wild damner on.
What wonder, in the face of that, that Duncan
curses, and offers to bet any money that his
junior printer’s-devll’s kangaroo pup could write
better verse with its tail ?
Professor Andrew, of Melbourne Univer-
sity is suffering under a severe disappointment.
A few evenings back the Professor saw a rainbow
after sunset. He slept little that night, and at 7
next morning he dragged his beloved Argus from
under the front door and looked for letters to the
editor concerning this rainbow “ Sir, Shortly
after the glittering orb of day had sunk below the
horizon a phenomenon of singular Australian lev
terest,” &c., &c. But not a line was in the paper.
Morning after morning the professor sought in
vain, until at last he wrote a letter him-elt with a
view to working up the scientific wo<ld into a
decent condition of delirium. The poor man
moaned: “I have been expecting for some days
past to find my own surprise confirmed by letters
in your paper." We are real sorry for Andrew.
The savant whose intellect hungers for letters in
the Argus must be in a bad way. We haven’t
time juso now to write a long letter ourselves, but
beg to offer one little suggestion. Perhaps the
phenomenon may he attributed to our Gracious
Queen's Jubilee.
Bob Ingersoll, the American preaching
atheist, sent a jug of whisky to an enemy, accom-
panied by the following letter:— “l send yon
some of the most wonderful whisky that ever
painted landscapes in the brain of man. Drink it,
and you will hear the voices of men and maidens
Binging the * Harvest Home,’ mingled with the
Ighter of children. Drink it, and you will fee
bin your blood the star-led dawns, the dreams
nany perfect days. For 40 days this liquid
has been within the happy staves of oak long-
to touch the Ups of man." The party who ra-
ped the jug wasn’t heard from for some time,
eventual/y he wrote as follows: —“ Dear sir,
’or ten days after drinking that broth of hell
t s ou sent me, I have seen snakes
iugh to fill all the menageries on the earth. A
lion devils have danced round my brain, and I
tq had a headache such as man never had
ore. Besides, the judge before whom I was
ught on the charge of disorderly conduct, said
vould be 13 dollars or 15 days. I never heard
idens singing the ‘ Harvest Home,’ but I tried
dng ‘ We won't go home till morning’ till the
iceman clubbed me. Since I got out of gaol,
nose has acquired the colour of a rear lantern
a night luggage-train, and my hair comes out.
I have to comb it with a roll of soft cotton.
,y you be consigned to the place you allege does

We have a firm belief in the never-failing
itice of Providence and firmly believed that Dr.

l impious and profane brand. “ The beastly fel-

Purves, Q.C., revived in the Supreme
ourb, Melbourne, the other day, an old story
tat went the rounds 20 years ago. The late
ick Ireland, Q C., was in a difficult case in banco.
oor Richard wasn’t much of a lawyer—his strong
olnts being turning witnesses inside out in cross-
Eamination and palavering juries. Whenever
0 had to fight against a question of law Dick
as obliged to have a smart junior who was well
p in the Acts and “ cases.” On this particular
ccasion, young Hickman Molesworth was Ire-
ind s junior. “ Oh, I eay, Ireland," said Hick-
ian, tripping into cou't, “I’m with you in this
ase of Snipson and Snooks, but we haven t a
host of a show, old man. There’s a case of De
mith and Fitz-Jones reported in 7 Meeson and
Felsby 162, on all fours with this where Chief
ustice Earle, in a judgment of the full court, de-
ides dead against us. Billing, who’s going to
how causa against the rule, is bound to
ite it." “What’s the reference again? In-
[uired Richard. Hickman repeated it. “ Oh.
tever mind De Smith and Fitz-Joces,” said Ire-
and, “I’ll fix that case.” Later on, the Q.C. might
lave been seen rummaging about the Supreme
lourt library, and then sliding into Court where
re sab at the Bar-table till the case was called.
< if your Honors plaza, I move the rule absc-
ute,” said Richard, rising. Then Richard An-
jesley Billing. Q.C., with his lovely Dublin ac-
sent, proceeded to show cause why the rule should
Be discharged. After he bad spent half-an-hour
n arguing the merits of the case, he went on
hus : “ There's a case in the books, your Honors,
dmost identical with this, in which the law on
;he subject is clearly laid down. I can’t remem-
3nr the name —Fitzsmith and O’Jones or some-
thing. It strikes me Ps reported in Meeson and
Welsby, but the reports in the library aren’t
Bomplete. There’s a volume missing, and
I fancy the case Is in it." At this juncture
little Schutt, the librarian, was scaling ladders
In all directions looking for 7 Meeson and Wels-
by, bat with no good result, and, as a last
resource, he stuck up the following invitation in
the library Would the gentleman who took
7 Meeson and Welsby from the library kindly
return it to the library at once In the mean-
time, Billing closed his arguments and had to do
without Fitzsmith and O’Jones, Richard Ireland
then got on his legs and sat upon poor Billing in
one painful act. The Court made the rule abso-
lute, with costs. It then turned out that Ireland
had sat on Meeson and Welsby, as well as Billing,
for the great Q.C. produced the 7 th volume of
those eminent reporters from under the cushion
of his seat and politely whispered to Molesworth,
“ Hickman, old man, chuck this damn book over
there baside Fellows. Come over to Anderson's.
I’m choking for a drink.” Some time afterwards
Schutt was seen with a book in his hand vehe-
mently gesticulating at Fellows, who was very
red in the face and saying something about
“damn.”

Dear Bullytin, —l am a whaler, and send

boss of Paranafou, a misyrabel littel ilend in the
Sowth Paslflick, has turned agin the whalers and
never hists his fether-duster when a mishynery is

run short of water, and he put in at the ownly

his barrels and git a supply of wooed. Cubby the
Oneth was fond of rum, and welkumed the whlte-

A zealous and efficient state dog-man was
grievously imposed upon the other day in a Vic-
torian township by a soulless clod of a market-
gardening party who can’t even write his own
Ignoble cognomen. The dog-man’s duty is to
hustle after mendicant canines and pursue them
with velocity and despatch until they are over-
taken and captured, after which he dips them in
a well until their souls take flight; he also collects
registration fees, and has the law upon the har-
bourera of illegitimate poodles. This particular
canine constable is a proud, cold man with a
piercing black eye and a pile of stupendous cheek.
The market-gardener called him “ Doggy ” in the
street, and derided his calling, and consequently
he loathed the cultivator of greens, and laid for
him at every possible opportunity. At night ho
turned stray dogs into his garden and in the
morning he went along to have him fined, but the
market-gardener sat up late at night and heaved
the dogs out, and the constable misled him every
time. But at last the soul of the dog-man sang
for joy, for he observed a large, brown retriever
tied to a stump In the hostile back yard, and he
pounded at the door and howled for admittance.
“Is that there dorg registered?" he demanded
sternly. “ Naw," “You’ll have to register it.”
Naw ” “ But I’ll make you.” “Go and bust.”
“I’ll summons you.” “ See ye d d first.”
“Looky ’ere, you’ll be fined.” “Go it, Doggy;
geo up, and be ” (to be continued in our next).
The local pup-annihilator fled down the street like
a cyclone and took out the summons, and the c ase
came on for hearing. “ Josiah Perkins, yer
charged wid harborin’ an unregistered dorg,” said
the Bench. “I are, yer washup,” said the de-
fendant; “an’ the dorg’s in court. Praps ye
pnigbt like to have a look at him.” Hero Josiah
hauled the dog from under a seat and dumped it
down “ forninst ” the Bench. It was stuffed. A
wild promiscuous game had bean put up on the
dog-paralyser, and after throwing upwards of 80
stray ours over Perkins’ fence he had been trapped
into suing a stuffed canine. Collapse - general
row —gall and wormwood—voice in the court
heard to say audibly “ damn."

There was a Sunday-school picnic the other
day in the neighbourhood of Lake Buloke (N.S. W ),
where the bun grows on the bun yah tree and the
stale tart spreads its wings upon the bhst, and
the Inflated pie walketh in darkness. The day
before the proposed spread two agile male teachers
arrived on the spot with a tank full of fresh
water, which same they ’ad ’umped a matter of
two mile, as one of them afterwards explained in
ungodly wrath. This they placed in a boat, the
water of the lake not being up to par in the shade;
They also brought a copper-boiler, and sat it up
on end beside the tank. Next day about 80 pink
legged infants arrived bearing ginger-beer, cakes,
and other Christian refreshments, and they all in-
dulged in games until the lady-teachers’ hair came
down, and the whole company had a thirst) which
an egg could have been boiled on. Then they
looked far the copper, and, alas! it was gone. It
had been copped. In the place where it had stood
was a placard bearing the inscription, “ The
hoard will provide ” So they waited awhile, but
no copper descended from on high, and the
same two male teachers walked three miles
to borrow a washing boile ■ from a selector, who
made them leave a deposit, and then walked
tires miles back with their burden, and flopped
from sheer exhaustion under a tr»e. The next
move was to make t*e tea. The children had
been devouring dry buns all the time they were
waiting, and were parched beyond description
Just at this crisis it was found that the man who
stole the boiler had also emptied the tank, and
inaile it ha had put another little memo. —“ Take
NO SAVEE.
J.P. (loq.): “JOHN, YOU ARE FINED £ 5."
JOHN: “NO SAVEE.”
J.P. (louder): “DON’T YOU UNDERSTAND? YOU ARE FINED £10.”
JOHN (excitedly): “HI. YOU VELLY MUCH SWINDLER ME, YOU SAY F1 POUND. THEN YOU SAY TEN POUND.
YOU CHEATER CHINER MAN. NO SAVEE.”
no thought for the morrow, what ye shall eat or
what ye shall drink, for Bill an’ me has took the
water.” It came on to rain at this point, and a
sad, solemn, scowling Sunday-scVool “push”
trampqd wearily homeward, and two male
teachers tottered along in the rear with the bor-
rowed boiler. The moral of this, story is that it is
better to be an alderman and get drunk than to be
a Sunday-school teacher under a hot sun with an
empty tank.

Tuapeka (N. Z.) is a little township, which
is at times pretty hard up for a sensation. It is
the centre of a dreary, half-exhaus ed goldfield,
where the dismantled shafts gape sorrowfully in
all directions, and where every gully is Insolvent
and each hill has a pawnbroker’s duplicate at-
tached to it, showing that the interest is over-
due. It is a place that the average bank dude
arrives at with melancholy and disgust, and leaves
in a hurry. The other day, young Brown, of the
local financial Institution, got his walking-ticket
with feelings of gladness, and, preparatory to
going back to civilisation, he discarded the half-
soled pants and the decayed swallo w-tall which he
had worn as the outward symbols of his sorrow
while sojourning in the Wilderness. He put them
up in a black bag together with some other frag-
ments of his wardrobe and a brick, and dropped
the lot in the river in the silent watches of the
night. An hour later, as the village policeman
was thoughtfully opening and shutting his head
as he leaned against the post outside the public-
house, a young woman came breathlessly along
and told him that she had seen a man throw the
dead body of an infant into the stream. The
stupefied cop stood one moment to glare, and
then rushed for a grappling-iron, and, as he
scudded with unwonted velocity towards the
river, he gasped out to a Salvation Army major
who was passing, “Hlnfant drownded !" The
major also fled towards river, and told a
Chinaman as he flew, am Ir a a Chinaman gave the
alarm to his fellow Chow« and they all ran. Also
the women of the locality got out of bed, and tore
away for the scene of den* h, and somebody tele-
graphed for assistance to «. pture a desperate band
of bushrangers, and somebody else called out the
Are brigade, and the rest shouted “ Thieves !,’
Then, in the presence of all the assembled popula-
tion, did Constable O'Hooligan, officer of the
peace, fall over tho local accountant and share-
broker in his efforts to haul up a black bag with a
brick tied to the handle, and, with the assistance
of several bystanders, he deposited the same care-
fully on the bank. “ The heartless wretch,” ex-
claimed a parson, as he saw the bag and the
brick ; “ the villains,” sobbed an hysterical female;
“ Poor little darling,” said the Salvation major;
“Welly wicked Eulopean,” murmured a China-
man ; and then, with a superhuman effort,
Constable O’Hooligan wrenched open the bag. It
contained a pair of pants, the sitting portion of
which had been worn away, two torn dickeys,
one split boo* l , four socks, one crushed plug hat,
and a swallow-tail coat worn to the last gasp, in
the pocket) of which were found a lady’s pocket
handkerchief, one peppermint, a half-eaten apple,
and a dishonoured cheque. The company took in
the nocturnal bathos of the scene at one glance,
and then they rounded on O’Hcoligan and called
him a T pperary maniac Even the Chinaman
went tack on him in that hour of derision and
observed with an air of disgust, “ Polishman
fellow big fool, makee one heap sick,” and the
parson admonished him for trifling with sacred
things, till he was moved to dance on the bag
and kick It back into the river. He missed it,
ho wever, and kicked the brick.

When the Irish nation starts to shift a pig
that pig has got to shift, or something is going
to bust. The other Saturday afternoon a Kerry
female entered the Launceston (Tas.) railway
station, and proceeded to negotiate second-class
tickets for herself, two good sized swine, one dog,
and a small billy-goat. “We don’t Issue tickets
for swine,” said the clerk, scornfully. “ Then
yez 11 p'raps be good enough to tell me how I m
to take them pigs, the crathers, wid me to Tijlo-
raine ? ’ demanded the Kerry image, sternly.
“Why, you must engage a cattle truck.” “ An’
rhwat’ll bs the ixpance of that, yflung man?’
“ A shilling a mile.” “Ashilfln’ a mile ! Tw6
pound foive, is it ? Bad luck to the sowl av yez,
it’s only two pound I’m givin’ fur the bastes en-
tirely, an’ yet would charge me foive shillings
more than the crathers are worth. Ooh, I’ll
nlver pay any sich proice, ye murtherin’ thief.”
1 hero was a long hiatus here, and there seemed
to be every prospect of the lady and the pigs
havirg to travel by the dirt road, but
at last an appeal was carried to the
station-master and the distracted passenger drew
such an affecting picture of herself and the pigs
I ram pit g to their distant home along ihs dusty
highways that he gave in, A new tariff was
framed on the spot, the pigs were classed as dogs,
and the deg was catalogued as a parrot,, and the
goat was entered ss a cat, and then the whole
menagerie was landed into (he luggage-van Or,
at least, they would have been, only the pigs
braced their feet firmly and kinked their little
curly tails and resisted all the human machinery
of the department. In sheer desperation, four
porters glued themselves on to the smaller
of the swine and erdeavoured to hist its
hind leg off the pla’form, but tha animal
merely gave a heave and landed the whole
crowd oa the permanent way. Then the lady
threw aside her umbrella and girded herself up.
There was one tremendous convulsion which
seemed to tear up the roots of the civilised earth,
and a pig ft?w through the a'c and landed in the
van. Another superhuman wrench which made
the representative Institutions of the colony totter
cn their base and the second hog, was fetched
along and loaded beside his companion, and then,
with a lopk of withering derision, the female from
Kerry put her bonnet straight and took her seat.
The Department felt small, but it smothered its
feelings and the train started on its way.

Some Ne\x Zealand fogies, have been fol-
lowing the example lately set in Queensland, and
have gone in for a girl show. Six bald-headed
old great-grandfathers in blue winkers acted as
judges, and the young ladies started by writing a
letter apieos and then perpetrating a mutton-pie.
At noon luncheon was served, and the competi-
tors were watched to see that they didn’t put
their knives right into their kissing apparatus.
One was disqualified for choking and another fox-
getting her fork in her eye, and a third got three
b a i mark s for douhlin g her feet under her and sitting
on her boots. Then they had to wash up, and
mend a pair of stockings apiece, and sew on a
button, and while they were doing this the judges
examined the letters and the pies, and disqualified
another young lady because her epistle commenced
with “ this comes hopping.” Finally, those who
had got through the ordeal so far were Inspected
through a microscope tn the question of per-
sonal neatness, and a girl with burst boots
and feet that turned sideways was told
to stand out. £hs sail she could lick the judges
with one hand, and asVed them to come on and
she would make them swallow their own winkers,
and, anyhow, she would set her big brother on
them. By this time there were only two girls left
in the show, and, as one of them had crumbs in
her hair, she was set aside and the survivor got
the prlzs. The girl with the burst boots went
away raving, and quarrelled outside with the girl
who had choked at lunch. The young lady who
put her fork in her eye expressed her doubts as to
the respectability of the winning girl’s grand-
mother, and the air was filled with words like
“ nasty cat.” The prize girl wont homo weeping
at last amid a storm of vituperation, and now she
lives in incessant fear of the creature with the
burst boots, and wishes to goodness she had never
won the reward which was only a half-crown
cookery-book anyhow. Girl-shows are not, so to
speak, an unalloyed success, and they are neve r
likely ti be until the day of the last great girl-
show in the stupendous Hereafter.

The N.S. W. Foreign-tradepartyhavemade
much capital lately out of an alleged “ fact ” that
N.S. W. bad more cash deposited in the Savings
Banks than had Victoria. The reality is, how-
ever, that Victoria, on the 30 h Jane, 1887, with
35,000 less population, was nearly £200,000 ahead
iu cne matter of deposits. The precise figures
heirg—Victoria, £3,564 580; N.S.W., £3.394,636
—so much for Protec. ion and the working man s
savings therefrom. In Victoria the number of
depositors was 203,845, while in N S.W., with a
larger population, there were only 114,085.
The N.S.W. papers are carried free of
charge. The astute proprietors of certain London
alleged papers are perfectly aware of this momen-
tous fact In order to save postage they simply
forward every mail electro-plates of the current
number of their print, work off the copies in
Sydney, and send them ronnd per the man in the

They are used to it, you know. They stated there
had been some disturbance amongst the men
belonging to the Squadron now in N. Z, waters,
but learning that the Hadmlral was annoyed con-
siderable at their remarks, and fearful of losing
the chance of a beer and cheese with him, they
took it all back. But there was a good deal of
die satisfaction on board all the same, and it took
pretty practical shape. Most of the portable
articles about were hove overboard, including
eights of guns and other property belonging to
Her Mejeaty, and the chief figurehead of the fleet
was treated disrespectful like. Britons never
shall be slaves.
There is a hideous story of that Irish in-
surrection which raged in Wicklow and Wexford
at the close of last century that goes far to explain
the fathomless hatred with which Charles Stewart
Parnell regards the English rule in Ireland. The
captured insurgents were hanged, shot, and trans-
ported by scores, and one, as an example to the
rest, was ordered by the British commander to be
flogged to death on the abdomen. Among the
witnesses of this ghastly tragedy was a bay named
Gaffney, who grew up to be a servant on the Par-
nell estate. He never forgot the specimen of
British justice which had hoi rifled him in hia
early years, and it was his tales of the days of ’9B
which first started Mr. Parnell on the crusade
which made him the uncrowned king of Ireland.
FIDELITY.
The type of British sailor depicted by Mr. T. P.
Cooke, who wore a pigtail, danced hornpipes,
shivered his timbers, and was considered able to
roll six pirates at least into the lee scuppers is ex-
tinct, but the spirit of the true sailor burns as
high as ever even in these prosaic days of steam*
ships. Douglas, of the Lyeemoon, may be taken
as a fair type of this c lass, brave, true to his trus,*
and gentle and considerate to women and child
ren. When the ill fated vessel was well nigh
dashed to pieces on the rocks, and his own life
hung almost on a thread, he not only stuck to his
captain to the last, but did his utmost to save the
unfortunates about him. And this is but a single
illustration. Masters of ships, and sailors as well,
are rarely found wanting in time of peril. Capt.
James Hill, of the Victorian Government s.s.
“ Melbourne,” River Murray, says “ During
the past three years I suffered from most intense
pain in the head, night and day, for five weeks to-
gether, until my life became a burden to me. It
was with the greatest difficulty that I could dis-
charge my duty, and I thought that I should have
to resign. About nine months ago I went to a
chemist and asked him for Warner’s safe cure. I
had no faith in it, but I thought I would try one
bottle, and the effect was just marvellous ; it re-
moved the pain that I had in my left kidney for
three years. My urine wis very bad, and full of
brick dust. The first bottle b ought aqu mtity
of blood and slime from me, which gave the
greatest relief and better spirits, and I continued
to take Warner’s safe cure. I took 20 bottles, and
am glad to say that I am better than I have been
for the past 14 years. Headaches all gone, pains
in the back and kidneys all gone, spirits returned ;
I can do my duty without fatigue. My age is 57.
and I am well known in Bchuoa for the past 22
years. Have advised scores of others to try
Warner's safe cure with the same results,” Cap
tain W. Page, of the Queensland Government
steamer “Chter,” says:—“For several years I
have been afflicted with an ulcer on my leg, which
at times caused me the moat acuta pain. I also
suffered from pains In the loins and abdomina
regions. I procured Warner’s safe cure and
Warner’s safe pills, and after the use of four
bottles I gladly bear witness to the curative
powers of the medicine. My ulcer is nearly
healed, and my bodily health is greatly im-
proved.” Captain John Balfour, of Latrobe
Terrace, Geelong, says“ Having tried many
different medicines for liver and kidney disorders,
I must say I know of none to equal Warner’s safe
cure and Warner’s safe pills. I have reoom
mended them on all hands, and will continue te
do so.”


From the Evening Nzwg The case of
the Rev John Jones, who was recently expelled
from the island of Mare, in the Loyalty group, by
the French authorities of New Caledonia, con-
tinues to attract considerable interest among that
numerous class of the Australian community
which interests itself in the old
f nglish Christian missions in Polynesia.” A re-=
presentative of the Evening News recently waited'
upon the Rev. Mr Jone‘», and had a prolonged
interview with him, during which, in answer to a
number of questions, Mr. Jones observed ;
f '* ,s C^~o
1. “I paid, for my land in Polynesia, 16(1
yards of calicoes and 160 yards of print at la.
a yard. This was a lair and even a liberal
wice for the land, particularly when it is
wrne in mind that at the time the
natives attached absolutely no
value to it, and bad no idea that '
anyone would think of paying
so much for it ; and the
land was a mere steril«-
sand heap."
2. “ I made this land valuable after years of weary
labour The natives [the natives, it would appear,
did the ‘ weary ” business] carrying- away the
Sind in sacks, and bringing soil from the in'
fcerior of the island.”
5. By the bye, it just occurs to us. Supposing the
Bneiny of Suuls had put it into the hearts of those
heathen Polynesians to pay for the Rev. Jones ser-
mons in “ prints and calicoes at Is the yard,” perhaps
he would have built a different sort of house upon hfa
“ sand heap ”
6. “Mrs. Jones has been a splendid
housekeeper and economical manager
during the thirty years she assisted
me in my mission work at Mare.
♦. " I may mention that my house, which I was several
years in building at a great cost, contains all the fittings,
conveniences, and modern appliances cf a suburban residence
in Sydney. It contains sitting and dining roomstudy,
numerous bedrooms bath-rooms, school-rooms, store-rooms,
and kitchen. These are all filled with modern furniture, and
stores of the most varied and extensive description The,
total value of the whole must considerably exceed £.5000.”

Society
This little story relates to an Australian
bishop, and it is told with all due reverence, and
with every possible effort to bear light on the dig-
nitary in the gaiters and the broad shovel hat.
He had been out at a sacerdotal feed and was re-
turning home in his carriage, when it occurred to
him that the vehicle was zig-zagging in a way
which did no 1 ! accord well with the solemnity of
the Church. At one mo in ant it was shaving the
gutter at one side of the street, and the next it
was making a bee-line for the opposite lamp-post,
and then it would start at a gallop in pursuit of
an old woman half a mile ahead, and when she
just escated beicg brained the driver would hail
her as “ old girl,” atd ask where she bought that
hat. At last the bishop stuck his episcopal head
out of the window, and took stock of the position,
only to discover that the driver was a wild, hoo-
raying drunkard, and was totally unfit to be
trusted out with a bishop. So he was pub inside,
and the reverend gentleman drove home while
his servant wallo ved in the bottom of the vehic’e.
At the gate a groom came out and looked up at
the coachman tbrongh the darkness. “ Why,
Bill,” he exclaimed, with a guffaw, “ I’m blessed
if ye ain’t got old Tommy’s hat on ! ’’ He got a
rebuke from old Tommy which made him totter
in his boots, and the remarks he afterwards made
to Bill, whom he regarded as the cause of his un-
doing are not fit to appear in these columns.
Somewhere about a year ago a happy
young lawyer left his childhood's home in Eng-
land to look for clients in the strange land of the
Maori and the apparently extinct moa, which
latter still keeps on being extinct. He was' a
mother’s joy and a fond father’s pride ; he had a
little money, and he was sea-sick—awfully, aw-
fully sick. When he recovered from this afflic-
tion he took to gambling, and gob rid of every
cent he owned, and, on landing, he wasn’table even
to raise enough to pay for admission to
the local Devil’s Brigade. So he tramped
the streets of Auckland, and his postal
address was No. 1 boiler on the wharf.
Things were not very joyous in that boiler, and
at night as the wind whistled through it he lay
and dreamed of home, and wished he had fallen
overboard while a child. But at last one night a
shock-head looked in upon him, and a voice asked
if the galoot inside wanted a sheol of a job, and if
he did he’d better come out pretty slick. He
came out, and the owner of the shock-head set
him to work at cleaning out a stable. Two hours
later he knocked him down with a pitchfork,
and next day he threw him down from the hay-
loft. At the end of a fortnight of carting dirt and
similar employment the lawyer asked for his
wages, and was told in return to stoop down, and
when he had done so the owner of the premises
took a running kick at him contrary to the laws
of hospitality as understood by civilised nations.
The lawyer laboured in the stable in a bell-topper,
and when he went to bed In the manger he was
accustomed to plant this article and the
rest of his clothes under his bunk to
prevent the horses knocking them into the week
after next. The night after he was kicked he did
this as usual, and at midnight's solemn hour a
dark form sto’e into the premises and took away
everything except some hay and a shirt, A young
and promising solicitor from home now camps in
an empty stable in one single undergarment, and
subsists on charitable contributions which are
passed in under the door, and his only hops is
that he may be able to hold out there until he
gets an answer t j the unstamped letter which he
gave to a boy to post to his father. It the boy
didn’t post it goodness only knows what will
become of him.

“ At the head of that great bedy, which
spreads far and wide over the land, stands our
illustrious Grand Master, the Prince of Wales ”
(Loud applause).— Speech of the Earl of Carnar-

socie'iy paper that “It will probably surprise a
good many to be informed that Princess Beatrice's

sor, unaccompanied, except by their nurses.”
Shades of the Conkeror, is this a fact? We
should have thought that they would have gone
through the town in a gilded chariot drawn by
Arabian horses, and driven by a Dook, with a
crowd of loyal citizens in front, hu rating and
strewing the read wrh flowers aad ad rei.es,
and a troop of Horse Guards, and a brass band
and a dog-fight or two bringing up the rear, and
that a gilded menial would come tearing along
behind them with a plate of tarts in case the
Battenberg infants might feel hungry. This ii

we would have had the Meyor and Corporation
turned out—particularly the corporation -1 nd the

about pomp, anyhow.

leaving the man who lived by retailing goats as
lamb chops to mourn in his desolate home. For a
little while the guilty pair enjoyed their stolen
happiness on a foreign strand, and then their fate
ovr rtook them. The butcher rose with vengeance
in his eye, and, leaving the veal cutlets to decay
upon the counter and the sausages to perish In
the window, he followed in pursuit. He overtook
them in London, and shot the doctor’s legs from
under him, so that he bad to go to the hospital on
his hands, and as the shrieking female turned to
fly he fired into her bustle. Then he scudded into
the caves of seclusion, and the two sinners are
having the shot picked out of them In the hos-

At an Anniversary ball in 1811 much admiration is re-

viz , “A black in one of the most animated attitudes of the
corroboree, pointed, with his waddy, at the Church of St.
Philip, at which an accurate perspective was given, as sym-
bolical of the Christian religion inviting them to happiness.
The undrersed son of the forest pointing his club
at a church and waiting for the minister to come
out with a view to caving his head in isn’t quite
our idea of what a Christian symbol ought to be,
but it doesn’t matter. Even without the club,
the naked nigger isn’t very appropriate, but it
isn't of any consequence. Still, wa think that a
native throwing a spear at a tea-meeting would
perhaps have filled the bill a little better, or a gin
heaving a rock at a bazaar, or a kangaroo letting
out with his hind claw at a monk—but, anyhow,
it doesn’t signify at all.

The Auckland (N.Z.) Salvationists cele-
brated Christmas by an all-night gathering for
prayer and wailing. The meeting commenced
after the hour when the sinful publican gives up
his trade and closes the shutters, and by midnight
there wasn’t a collar in the place that hadn’t
burst. The officer of blood and glory admonished
the faithful to let the starch fly and let out
another reef in the main hatch, and the excite-
ment grew awful. The trombone was blown out
straight; several virgins fainted and were re-
moved into the coal-hole; a Maori got converted
and said that all he had he would give to the
Loard, but when they sized him up he bad only a
shady title to a half-acre onion patch ; and a Gar-
man got on the platform and said, “I’ve found
peace and now I donkerdam for anything.” Then
the officer in charge delivered an address about
the evil spirits which entered into the swine and
rushed down a steep place into the sea, and specu-
lated a little as to the fate of any demon who
couldn't ride a swine and who consequently got
left. Next a lady got on a chair and testified,
and there was a thud, a swish, a scream,
and two roars, and a pile of female and chair was
scattered on the floor. An elderly man came in
and said he wanted his daughter, and he was in-
formed that she was insensible in the coal-hole.
Tea was handed round, and a girl of 45 began to
Foream and jumped seven feet in the air. About
3.30 a.m. a burglar was saved, but when a police-
man came in and was saved also, he fled. The
proceedings closed with a collection.

broken out Into open warfare, and are fighting
with bricks and lawyers and half-crown sum-

Meanwhile the cat preserves a neutral attitude,
and oversees the proceedings from a chimney,
where he has perched awaiting a settlement. Ha

p Unless the “Ladies’ Co'umn” of a fashion-
able paper is carefully edited, it is better to leave
the miserable thing nut altogether. For instance,
a youth who does rhe dress gush for a N. Z jour-
nal recently supplied this to his high-toned female
readers, and most of them stopped the paper right
off:-
“ Suede gloves remain in favour, but flannel undershirts
and woollen socks go high this weather ”
The human mind sits down to contemplate this
shock. Nearly 6000 refined females have been
informed at one most fatal go that socks go high,
and have had their attention drawn to flannel
undershirts by a paper which has long boasted
that it publishes nothing which is calculated to
bring a blush to any countenance. Naturally
enough therefore, they stopped their paper.
Socks are a subject that doesn’t pay when inserted
among the fashionable intelligence, and the un-
tutored journalist may lay an egg upon this fact
for future reference.

Baron Smith and a crowd of followers
went out the other day to swelter upon that
desolate stretch of shadeless gravel, the Sydney

states that while there “Lord Carington made
many valuable suggestions which were at once
acted upon, and showed a very earnest desire to
have the ceremony carried out in such a way that
the people generally w. uld be able to see all that
look place.” From which we gather that the
Baron —through his secretary—has grasped the
idea that the people who pay Smith will kick if
they don’t get a chance to see Smith do hla work.
It la a beastly way the “lower orders” have.

An economic Tamworth firm rather over-
reached themselves recently. They had a big
supply cf 1885 calendars on hand, and resolved to
play it low down on their confiding customers by
erasing the first and last numeral and letting them
stand as almanacs for ’BB. In this form they sent
them round with the usual Xmas bills, and the
scheme worked to a marvel, until one man dis-
covered that the first of January on the almanac
and the first of January according to local super-
stition didn’t eventuate on the same day ! This
shook public confidence in itself, and for a week
the township was crowded with excited agricul-
turists, wildly asking each other what day it was.
Those who had almanacs thought it was Sunday,
and shut up shop and went to church, while those
who had net a calender went nap that it was
Thursday or thereabouts and held a race meeting,
and encouraged a dog-fight opposite the sanc-
tuary and started an auction at the back, and got
drnnk all over the place. Things became so
mixed at last that (ho firm owned up to the econo-
mical deception, and the dazed citizens accepted
the explanation with tears of profound joy, and
went home enlightened.

Speaking of the bone and hide exhibits at
th e theatres, an American journalist sorrowfully
remarks that “ a white, round neck, with an ala-

is the most bewitching thing in the world ; but a
large expanse of bony shoulders, painted like a
patent ham, with Its contiguous unprotected ter-
ritory, has about as many attractions as a newly-
painted Windsor chair.” And the worst of It Is
that the ham female is so plentiful, and the one
with the alabaster neck is so woefully scarce.

mean the jelly—the nursing. The other day a

The wondrous feeds in Albert Hall, he d not for-

And the flowing cup that sparkles on the Mason’s

After which brief, weird statement he would back
to Tummy roam ;
And the gaping snobs got feeling that if Wal§s

He would call them “Jack” or “Jimmy," and
take them out and shout.
Then that wily Karl went homeward to the board-

And chuckled as he pondered o’er the yarns he’d

When the Book of Manchester was bossing
the railway banquet at Broken Hill, some wild,
untutored savages took a rise out of his old
nobility. It offended their ideas of the eternal
fitness of things to see the Dock sitting there in
all his majesty, looking that clean and haughty
you can't think; a certain high-toned sneer hover-
ing round the ducal month, wounded them in
their tenderest feelings. So when the little pastry
kickshaws came on, a ’omy-handed leveller of
ranks and creeds tuggtsted that it would be an
act cf poetic jus ice to spile the Dock’s shirt front.
Thereupon the company began to heave chunks of
jam-tart at Manchester, in ' he hope that he wonld
call them demned low-bred fellahs, and give them
just cause and reason for filling his boots with
blanc mange. The Dock, however, heaped coals
of fire upon his persecutors by placidly flicking
the jam-tart off his front and pretending to think
that it had been chucked at the waiters. Popular
feeling then veered round in favour cf the noble
chairman, and when the first conspirator proposed
further indignities, he was desired to “stow it,
and larn better manners.”

For the first time in ics windy career the
Australian Natives' Asacciation is attracting some
measure of public attention. Two separate in-

day wanting to know what the Association was,
anyhow, and what kind of fowls were lodging on
its blessed branches. From this one may infer
that the Association is nearing its latter end. So
long as the wretched little bladder floated around
in a murky atmosphere of dim otscurity it was
safe enough, but now that it has become visible to
the naked eye of common-sense somebody will sit
on the bladder and bust it with a mild pop. Phil
Robinson was responsible for the nastiest jar yet
given to the A.N.A.’s promoters, when, after
banqueting on their chicken and champagne, he
coolly remarked that there appeared to te no

The Natural History of Yankee
Adventurers.
The following is forwarded by an apparently
exasperated correspondent, and as a specimen of
a large, full-blown libel of the most comprehensive
type it is inserted in these columns for the amuse-
ment of mankind
Dear Bulletin, —The Yankee swindler is not
as his English brother in roguery. His Gil
Blaslsm puts on a more plausible exterior, and he
is less of a conscious hypocrite. The Englishman's
scoundrel ism has a Scriptural basis, and his career
of deception is interrupted and illumined by occa-
sional flashes of rectitude which mar the con-
sistency of his villainy. The Yankee Is a man of
words, specious and well-sounding, with which
he disguises, iven to his own inner conscious-
ness, the dubiousness and ambiguity of his
designs. The English boy, when he leaves school,
is ever presented with a Bible, the American boy
with a dictionary, which through a Ufa of mingled
success and failure he never parts with. “Webster
Unabridged ” is the companion cf his solitude and
the comfort of his hours of sadness and bereave-
ment. We do not credit Mark Twain's account
of the fortunes and fate of that venerable vade
mccum of philology In the Big Tree region of
Calaveras county. It sounds too wildly impro-
bable. Webster is the saint of the parvenu, his
dictionary the bible of Yankeedom. Every digger
In Angel’s Camp—nay, from Jackass Gulch to
San Andreas—must have had one. Perhaps this
Is Mark’s quiet, satirical way of poking fun at the
national propensity. Every properly constituted
American who travels carries his dictionary next
his heart, tied up In a bundle with a book of
heady-made speeches, a complete letter-writer, a
copy of the Lightnirg Calculator, a bundle of
tooth-picks, a bottle ot Joseph Balsamo's St. Cag-
liostro’s Mule Varnish, a looking glass, a pair
of spare sleeve-links, and some sulphate of morphia
and bromide cf potassium. The attire of the
American who resides abroad for the good of the
barbarians amongst whom he sojourns is fear-
fully and wonderfully made. The services of a
practical engineer are continually on draught to
keep him in order. His collar is fixed to his neck
by a patent coupling. His necktie is screwed on
to his shirt by a piece of Intricate mechanism.
Sleeve-links o- solitaires keep his cuffs together,
but they are further prevented from wandering
from their proper adiustment by iron-girder i
which parallel his fore-arm. Evsn the radiant
bear’a-grease with which he burnishes his Pari-
sian cut h»ir is rivetted and copper-fastened to
his tyacinthine locks After landing from the
steamer with nothing but a carpet-bag mostly
full of samples, ha dyes his moustache and per-
fumes his body, spreads to the adm’rlng gazrof
the ignorant or vulgar an acre or so of hot-pressed
shirt-front, garnishes his expansive chest with
half a-dozen imitation diamonds as big as hazel-
nuts, girds up his loins with a league or two of
heavy gold-washed chain-cable, puts a dozen or
more massive rings upon his forefinger,
straps down his beautifully-fitting trousers,
polishes his boots with bloater-pasbe, surmounts
his pomatumed curls with a sheeny belltopper,
lights his fragant Henry Clay “ seegar,” and
sallies forth to prey upon the ignorant native and
to spoil the unwary.

The American rogue is a Napoleonic creature
The magnitude of his operations is only bounded
by the ultimate limit of his credit. He finances
on the edge of a precipice, and floats bogus com-
panies to prospect an active volca 10 on the very
brink of a crater. His shop front covers an acre,
buh a step across the thresho’d lands you in the
back-yard. He “ shouts ” champagne without
the price of the flz in his pocket, and airily tells
A RELIABLE OPINION.
TOURIST (loq): “WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE WEATHER?”
INHABITANT: “WELL, IT MAY KEEP FINE OR IT MAY RAIN. I OUGHT TO
KNOW, AS I’VE LIVED HERE 30 YEARS.”
the barmaid to remind him about it next time he
calls. He presents you wit h a gold watch worth
£lO and has you for £lOO. He calls you his
dearest friend, and protests that the one thing
which wonld make him supremely happy would
be the prospect of dying for you, while he is coolly
helping himself to the very marrow of your life.
Republican on the surface, he is Royalist at heart,
and grovels to a lord for the sake of a dollar. He
sneers at English institutions, and smo hers his
plate glass with gold-lettering and armorial bear-
ings. He affects simplicity, and withers if not
within “000 ee” of all the effeminate ad-
juncts of a sybaritic luxuriance. He spreads his
life over a glittering surface of stage tinsel, and
when he talks sentiment the brazen ring of his
grasping voice sounds like a cracked cow-bell.
He eats In a crowd, and picks h’s teeth
in the presence of the universe. His very
amusements are a sham, and subserve his
cunningly-concocted swindles. The skating-rink,
the surprise party, the spelling bee, the base ball
club, the buttering dinner—each In turn is mate
the medium of an advertisement. The American
adventurer’s strong point is advertising. For this
will he degrade the noblest sentiments of human
nature, though we must in justice admit that he
is an unconscious sinner. Americans no longer
spit upon our material carpets, but they are con-
tinually expectorating on our mental floor-cloth
and excoriating our sensibilities by malapropisms
of sentiment.
* * *
The adventurer’s wife is usually a
poor intellectually-atrophied creature with tiny
feet and small, useless hands, hair banged and
frizzad and arranged round her white face in
what she calls —If she happens to be a swell—kiss-
curls ; if one of the mob, spit curls. She has fol-
lowed the male schemer to Australia with a vir-
tuous intention of helping him in his endeavours
to “teach us a thing or two,” ‘to open our eyes
a bit,” while, mayhap, he rakes in a few of these
“dollars and cen‘s” which are altogettur super-
fluous luxuries to people so ignorant of their use
as we are. She has the daintiest languid appear-
ance and a fresh brand of droopirg interest
for every oooasion. Americans have a fondness
for iced drinks and take them in every possible
Interval, alternating snow water with boiling
coffee. Henca their gums resemble a grubbed
ridge after clearing operations by a bush settler.
To remedy these mo’ar ravages they fill their
mouths with hireling grinders and masticate their
corporeal nutriment with the dental apparatus of
their dead and defrauded enemies. The Yankee
adventurer who swoops down on Australia to
show the gum-suckers how to run a newspaper, or
to push that sovereign panacea for all the ills that
fleshisheir to—St. Cagliostro’s Mule Varnish—or to
stimulate the musical tastes of a people to whom
he de ires to dispense the blessings of a Huckle-
berry piano, finds a mouth of the
great'st advantage in business. It is the out-
ward and visible sign of an inward and unseen
treasury. “Ahl” say the callow Australians,
“ This man has so much wealth that he plasters
his gums with gold. P- rhaps he eats the money
out of his cash-box, and some of tte so vereigrs
get j immed between his teeth.” Bub Napoleon
Theophilus Smith Scudder and George Washing-
ton Potts Browner do not glitter una ded. Mrs.
N. T. Smith Scudder and Mrs. G. W. Potts
Browner are also pressed Into the advt rising
trade. ’Tis theirs to carry the blessings of the
Huckleberry piano, or the Tearandblazas sewing
machice into the sacred atmosphere and
aristocratic environment of Darling Point and
Doable Bay, and to gladden the hearts of the ver-
dant with the specious hospitality that gleams
from a gold-plated phalanx of dead men’s ivories.
In “sassioty” the enterprising manufacturing
importer of the self-rectifying nutmeg annihi a'or,
which consumes its own smoke and converts the
dust into blocks of asphalt pavement, never ente s
but as the man who has some domestic cot nection
with the fragile and delicate piece of American
femininity, who dresses so superbly and has such a
mass of brown, abundant hair, “ which she wea-s
dressed on the side, my dear, and looped up with
diamonds as large as walnuts.” When the
Yankee adventurer is married, he generally
allows his wife to run the advertising business in
“ safsiety,” while he devotes his attention to the
importunate needs of St. Cagllcstio. He takes
care, however, to fetch her away in the evening,
so that people may say, “Oh ! there Is Mrs.
Smith Scudder’s husband, the importer of the
celebrated lockjaw windo v-fastener, which, ac-
cording to the advertisement, strengthens the
breath, sharpens the teetb, deadens the eyes,
clarifies the stomach, adds another perfume to
the violet, and is invaluable in cases of
fright, apoplexy, sauer-kraut and wooden

ran away with the Countess of Goglebu'arimo’a
order of So. Gull the Idiot, and hid it in a soup-
tareen. Tne Countess expired in a spasm of terror.
Mr. Smith Scudder gave her one draught of his
celebrated “Lockjaw Wjndow-faatener”—ad-
ministered it with a toasting-fork, because he

she was not only restored to life, but the order of
St. Gull the Idiot was recovered. There now I ”

If Mr. Smith Scudc 1 er is possessed of “ dol-
lars” and cents” enough to pay h ; s way he will keep
house on his own account —always wi h an eye to
profitable advertising. Th n Mrs. Snith Scudder,
the lady of Napoleo i Thecphilus Smi h Scudder
Esq., arranges the surpe’se n-rties and “ bosses ”
the preparation cf a thin, a very thin, entertain-
ment. Shs mamges all 'he surpri er, and mani
pulates all the buck-wheat and blu-ket quilting
operations. She spanks the piano with her dainty
little fingers § like a petulant young mother
whipping asulky child, who’d be d first before
he’d cry. She sings, too. She has songs,
viz., “ Donna e Mobile,” “The Harp in the
Air,” and “ Hark, the Lark,” and she regularly
goes through the programme in a thin, reedy
treble like the quaver of a soprano hand-saw
when it i r being tormented by a file. She recites !
—this is a note of admiration. Her repertoire is
limited here also, and “Lord Ullin’s Daughter,’
“ The Night Before Waterloo,” and “ Little Jim,”
about sum up the range of her memory in this
line. If she is encored, she gives “ The Village
Blacksmith ” with a break down on the second
verse, and “ There, Napoleon, I told sou haow it
would be. I knew I should break daown, an’t
was awl your fault. I’m real mad with you, any-
how. You ain’t niace.” Then poor Mrs. Smith
Scudder gives way to some other performer
anxious to inflict the dreary old song, or the
wrung-out, woe-begone recitative drivel that has
eo often done duty before, and retires into a quiet
corner to captivate, with the sheen of her silk and
the sweetness of her smile, seme poor devil of a
journalist who is supposed to have iclicence vi h
an uncaptured newspaper in which the Huckle-
berry hand-organ and the steam tooth-brush and
s iusHge-chcpper have not had a show b.fitting
their monumental merits. To this unlucky wight
she ]i j ps pret ily and confidentially and insinuates
a variety of things, some of which make her male
companion blush “ consumerily,” while she nibbles
complacently round the grazing-ground of the
positively naughty and forbidden. She is only
angling for an “ad.” to push her hubby’s little
swindle, and if the victim hi es will be amply re-
warded. Mayhap, she patters of literature and
mixes up in a bewildering melange the names of
“dear Dickens,” and “that darling Lytton," and
“ than real tart novelist Kirke White,” &c., &c.
She smiles to some purpose, however, when she
presides at the sumptuous spread ti visitor-con
tributed provender, and presses her guests to try
the frozen soap and sugar suds wh'ch people have
got into the fashion of calling ice-cream. But
why pursue the poor little wretch any farther 2
She always plays her cards well, follows suit and
nets many a trick lor her partner whoso trick she
is careful never to trump. The bond of their
union is a mutual desire to do us “ good” and to
return to the States in a year or so. with enough
of the “dollars and cents” to recompense them
for their exertions in the path of virtue, and to
set them up as gentlefolks in the alleged Demo-
cratic country they left a short time before as
“white rash.”
An to! y cub Beniamin Franklin Putnam, who is
not a married man, has to push the bound book
trade in “ society ”on his own account. He is a
lovely creature! He began life as an office-boy
in New York, and worked for a dollar a week. He
is no n worth thousands. He simply stuck to busi-
ness, dressed well, always smiled on a debtor, and
cursed a creditor from Sheol to breakfast. His
agents are everywhere. Afar on the limitless run
you stumble across the Yankee bound-book can-
vasser. He is übiquitous and omnipresent. He
parallels Providence. He enters a farm-yard to
be swallowed by the bull-dog, but re-appears
smiling in the township grocery, and manages to
talk the universal-emporium man—who had never
yet been caught by chaff —into making an ass of
himself for the first time in his life. The bound-
book agent is a fiend in human guise, who Ilea in
wait with a morocco binding and some gilt edges,
to persuade a man into bujing a compilation of
blasted drivel that it would be insulting to the in-
tellect of a limpet to mention in his presence as
literature. But that bound-book agent, by the
aid of his hair-oil and watch-chain and shirt front
—backedupby ‘ Webster Unabridged"—can i?s the
business through, secures the victim's order, and
gets five miles away before the effect of his elo-
quence wears off, and the dupe feels mad enough
to choke himself with a Yankee imported
wooden nutmeg. The American swindler,
with his specious carney ani plausible
geniality, sucks the marrow out of every
country he visits. He is a well dressed
vampire—a civil-tongued ghoul that carries a
dictionary. He rigs fictitious sales, floats mythi-
cal mines, conducts imaginary companies and
pays illusory dividends. He scorns to sand sugar
or to dust tea. He offers sand at an advanced
price, and proves its superiority to sugar by
advertised testintionials. His breath is a halo
which invests everything of which he speaks
with a golden atmosphere. He produces his
dictionary and the abandoned shaft becomes a
gold mine. He calls himself Joseph Balsamo,
the manufacturer of St. Caglicstro’s Patent Mule
Varnish, and people believe him tobethesalnthim.
self. He breathes into the ear of the compiler of
social chit chat, and 10, he takes his locale in the
“ sasslety ” of the place, and the columns of “ sas-
siety” papers, sacred to the social movements of
Little Peddlington, bee:me tte medium through
which he advertises the virtues cf Dr. Snook’s
Galvanic Currycomb. We do not like this plausible
rogue. If we must have rooks to pluck pigeons,
let us have the old gambling and racing, not the
stock-jobbing, share broking, company floating
commercial type. After all, we prefer the
Scriptural scoundrel from England, with the
sacerdotal snuffle and the Biblical brigandage
peculiar to his kind. He, at least, affronts no one
with his expanse of licen and looks humble enough
to kick or to jump upon, and that appeases us.
Again, he is not too beautiful to live, being gene-
rally a snivelling chunk of d relict pie im. He
resembles a materialisation of spiritual insolvency,
and, as he usually shaves, the wife d esn’t rave
about his beautiful “ mustivey,” or compare his
diurnady-harbored locks tc our own bald pate.
Yes, give us the hypocritical woe-begrimed Eng-
lish swindler and we’ll eat him. But not all the
wealth of Pactolus, with El Dorado and Ophir
and Golconda thrown in, and all the jewels stored
In the Hall of Eblis added to indues a bargain,
would tempt us to touch a molecule of the human
rat-poison that dumps itself down on Australian
shores with its consignment cf jim-iams and cure-
alls and clap-traps and trade-foolerijs in its seal-
skin waist coat-pocket. If we must be diddled,
let us ba diddled by something less like a cross be-
tween a Choctaw ani a Chinaman.— Skotos,
Not long ago we heard a fellow recounting
his experiences as a quack-doctor, in the N.S.W,
back blocks, and how he worked the business. He
used to hire a chemist to write out prescriptions,
then rent a cottage in a country town, and square
himself with the local pill-puncher. Ensconced
in the house, he would sit in a darkened room,
made up In a melodrama cloak, and as an African.
“ buttoners,” one with his arm in a sling,
and the other lame, would stand outside lh a
shanty, and when a country “ gawk ” came along
they would rope him in, crack up the quack, and
learn all the particulars of the gawk’s complaint.
Then one “buttoner” would slip inside, give the
duckter the tip, telling him “tha bloke had a
pain in his bingie,” or somewhere else, then exit
by the back way. The quack would then go to
the front door, sing out “nextl" return to his
room followed by the gawk. Quack would seat
himself, and assume an air of pondering mystery,
take hold of the gawk’s hand, mutter to himself,
and then inform his dupe all the “buttoner” had
already told him. He would then charge three
guineas, and write out one of the readied-up pre-
scription!, tha essential parts of which were
Epsom Salts. This narrative is dedicated to Dr.
Creed with the assurance of its being the bald
truth.

Hardened liver.
Five years ago I broke down with kidney and
liver complaint and rheumatism.
Since then I have been unable to be about at all.
My liver became hard like wood ; my limbs were
puffed up and filled with water.
All the best physicians agreed that nothing
could cure me. I resolved to try Hop Bitters ; I
have used seven bottles ; the hardness has all gone
from my liver, the swelling from my limbs, and it
has worked a miracle in my case ; otherwise I
would have been now in my grave.

We recommend these BITTERS to be taken two
or three times a day; a wineglassful for an adult,
smaller quantity for children.
For general Debility, Dyspepsia, Rheumatism,
and Cutaneous Affections.
The action of Dandelion, more especially upon
the liver and kidneys, is more reliable for remov-
ing all impure secretions than any other medicinal
plant known.
Persons suffering from Skin Disease will find
these Bitters Invaluable.
DIRECTIONS FOR USE.
One wineglass two or three times a day after
meals, diluted with same quantity of water. For
young people about half the quantity twice a day.
THEY PURIFY THE BLOOD AND LIVER.

mending Row's D anelion Bitters. 1 have been
suffering for several years with Liver complaint,
and been under several doctors for it without any
curative result. I have only taken two bottles of

recommended to try ROW’S DANDELION

A FOOL ONCE MORE.
‘ For ten years my wife was confined to her bed with such
a complication of ailments that no doctor could tell what
was the matter or cure her. and I used up a am»ll fortune in
humbug stuff. Six months ago 1 saw a IT. S. flag, with Dr.
Soule’s American Hep Bitters on it, and i thought I won d
be a fool once more, I tried it, but my folly proved to bo
wisdom. Two bottles cured her, the is now as well and
strong as any man s wife, and it coat me only two dollars.
Such roily pays —H. W., De-out, Mich.—" Free Press ”
HONORED AND BLEST.
When a board of eminent physicians and chemists an-
nounced the discovery that by combining some well known
valuable remedies, the most wonderful medicine was pro
due d, which would cure such a wide range of diseases that
most all other remedies could be dspmsed with, many were
sceptical; but proof of its merits by tctual trial hasdisp*Bed
all doubt, and to-day the ditcoverers of that great medicine,
Dr Sou e's American Hon Bi ters, are honored and blessed
by all as benefactors. Demooiat.”
A Good Remedy for. a Cold —On going to bed take a
dose of Freeman’s Ghlorodyue, either in v, ati r or campho>
miiture The diaphoretic action of this excellent remedy
speedily produces a general glow, followed by a free perspira-
tion, during which the pulse improves in character from a
feeble to a full, elastic one, a good night’s sleep is obtained
and on waking in the morning the co d will be found to have
disap pearered. The certainty of the action of Freeman’s
Chlorodyne is very remsrkable in Ague; it frequently pre-
vents an attack, or, failing this, reduces the violence of the
ague fit to a minimum. In many countries Freeman s
Chlorodyne has entirely superseded the use of Quinine, and
in the tea gardens ef India no'hing else is given for Agu
and other forms of Fever. A Physician writes, “In a sub
tropical climate, such as New South Wales, Freeman's
Chlorodyne is simply invaluable ’’—Sold every where through-

THE HEAT WAYE
Which is now passing over the colony reprodnces
for the benefit of the student of human nature
most of the old familiar antics of a dead and
buried past, just brightened up here and there
with some fashionable novelty which can only be
ascribed to the Centennial celebrations. Still, as
of yore, does the stout party avail himself of the
shady refuge of the street corner, while he re-
moves his hat, mops his oleaginous forehead with
the handkerchief of a vanished generation, and
snorts liVe the playful dugong the while ho an-
athematises the weather and splits the stream of
traffic into many small rivulets. Still does the
diaphanous virgin, whose lovely form is apparently
only held together by a ribbon sash, poke her
parasol into the eyes of the wicked man, or knock
the hat of the righteous under the fest of the
prancing ’bus-horse in tbe effort to preserve her
beauty from getting too suddenl j ripe in the sum-
mer sun of ths queen city And, “ surely as the
summer day," does the majestic matron come
along with her little clothes-basket of many
corners and charge through the crowd with her
shoulders set, her testh gritted, and a halo of
moisture around her. She, too, carries a gamp,
but the complexion of her youth is In the same
boat with the light of other days, and the princi-
pal use of the weapon is to clear the path of
obstacles. With an umbrella held firmly across
the body at an angle of do, and either end pro-
jecting about 6In. beyond the shoulder, a deter-
mined woman can do more damage in a street
crowd in one hour than all her male relatives
armed with regulation lat ces could do in a week.
But they are all suffering from the heat, and to
that fact principally must be ascribed their varied
eccentricities. The cool, calm, self-possessed
people in this fine sunny weather, the people who
seemingly monopolise all the bloom and vigour of
youth, are the people who are wise in their genera-
tion, deriving bsneflt from the wisdom and ex-
perience of others who know more than they do.
These people drink Clausen’s New York Cham-
pagne I ager Beer and learn therefrom the secret
o! looking and feeling fresh and invigorated when
all else is wilted into discomfort under the trealh
of the northerly furnace blast. Claus n is kept
on ice at all the leading hotels for the benefit of
suffering humanity.

The people of Auckland found the Marquis

Those Yankees are the cheekiest cusees

accept £2OO and Bond Teemer to Australia. How-

the Championship away with him. It strikes us
very forcib’y that the modest Yankees will have

pay tbeir own expenses at that.
