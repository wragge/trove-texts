LADY CHATTERLEY’S LOVER
What on earth is the Australian
censorship going to do about Lady
Chatterley’s Lover now that a British
jury has held that the Penguin reprint
of the novel is “not obscene”? Do we
maintain our own ban on it? Do we
release it? The Minister for Customs
is “reconsidering” it.
I must say that I don’t envy anybody
who has to make a decision about it, It
is all very well for somebody without
any responsibility in the matter to say,
as most of us like to do, that the arts
should be completely free; but the ulti-
mate result of complete freedom of
expression could be the circulation of
all kinds of pornography, down to the
Port Said feelthy photographs; and if
it could be argued that even feelthy
photographs don’t do most of us any
harm—l have survived the few I
have seen; without particularly wanting
to make a collection of them —it could
also be argued, and with reason, that
the free circulation of pornography
would tend to deprave and corrupt not
only the young and the unbalanced but
the whole standard of our civilisation.
If we have totally unbridled litera-
ture, why not totally unbridled be-
havior? And if totally unbridled
behavior might be fun for a while, obvi-
ously it would never be tolerated; and
obviously it would lead to a collapse
of civilised society as we know it. We
don’t want to sink into a Port Said —
the Port as it used to be, I should say:
the last time I revisited it the Egyptian
authorities insisted on a medical inspec-
tion of the ship’s passengers before
you were allowed ashore in their
impeccable city.
Of course “Lady Chatterley’s Lover”
is so far above the class of common
pornography that it is disgraceful,
really, to mention it in the same breath.
It is unquestionably literature. But it
is also, in its melancholy way, a very
rude piece of literature; and so inevit-
ably it falls into that category about
which censors can never make up their
minds —until a heroic British jury does
it for them, perhaps—the category of
the work of literature which uses, for
literary purposes, the scenes and the
wicked, wicked words which porno-
graphers use with much less respectable
intent.
Personally I have never cared very
much for “Lady Chatterley’s Lover” as
a novel. In fact the last time I tried to
re-read it I gave up halfway through
because I found it a bore. It used to
interest me in my adolescence, but even
then there were other D. H. Lawrence
novels (and poems) I liked better.
True, there are some pretty scenes
of lovemaking in it, a gallant forth-
rightness about the bodily functions
and quite a brilliant if painful piece
of comedy when the first of Lady
Chatterley’s lovers fails her so dismally.
Yet over the novel as a whole, if you
take it seriously as a credible story
about credible people, there is an air
of desolation. The great mistake was
in making the husband paralysed and
impotent. It is a miserable situation,
which seems more like something to be
confessed to a doctor than dramatised
in a work of art; and instead of getting
a truly dramatic story, or even just a
gay story, of a woman breaking out of
marriage for passion or for fun. we
have this wretched tale of Lady Chat-
terley taking a lover as a kind of medi-
cine, because she needs one. No matter
how Lawrence tries to work up scenes
of passion and tenderness, it is impos-
sible to believe that she is in love with
the gamekeeper; so all the love-making
stays cold and the betrayal of the hus-
band is merely pitiable.
But it is, in fact, impossible to be-
lieve the story at all. Aristocratic
women who take gamekeepers for their
lovers would be tougher, more Rabe-
laisian characters than Lawrence’s
pathetic heroine. Lady Chatterley
would take a lover from ii,,
if she took one at all; and " t n h * S! .
was a failure, as he is here i» e fet
find another on the same sodafe®
The whole thing is contri ved an ,
unreal It ,s a kind of dramatised , !
in whrch Lawrence was working onS
soe.al and mystical theories abou
necessity for warm-hearted lovers fa
ferably from the working classes) , 0
revitalise English life; and at the*!
time setting out most courageously
affirm the bodily functions . . and the
famous four-letter words in which the
are most aptly, or at any rate most
ononiatopoeically, described. The bodf
in all its manifestations, he tried to
say, was clean and natural; so were
the old folk-words that named its parts
or described its actions. The moral
thesis, not the novel, was Lawrence’s
chief concern. It is a kind of morality-
play; a morality-novel.
How is it, then, as a morality? To]
my mind it seems a very healthy one, 1
It might provide some unintended!
entertainment for schoolboys, who will !
search through even a dictionary for
words that give them ribald amuse-
ment; but it might also do a great deal
of good to lovers, even married couples,
afflicted by prudery. It is really much
more informative, as well as much
more lyrical, than the textbooks on
sex which wise parents give to their
young in their teens; and its purpose
is equally medicinal.
Is it publishable then? In England,
apparently, yes. In Australia? .&■
The story is obviously acceptable.;
Any day of the week you can read ;
much more alarming situations than|
that of a lady who has an affair with
a gamekeeper. The love-scenes are a bit.
lush in places, and sometimes uninten-
tionally comic: it is difficult to be as
serious as Lawrence is about other
people's private antics. But they are
also pretty and lyrical, and 1 think
they would get by if it weren t for the
exceedingly frank terms in which they
are described. It all turns, really, on
the four-letter words.
In fairness to Lawrence it should no
be forgotten that readers of goo
literature are already accustomed
seeing these words —even, sometimes,
the word —in print. Chaucer. Ka
lais. Shakspeare and Dunbar are a w y
likely to pop out with them, an
modern times you can find them (
that one) in such obscure and e
authors as James Joyce, Ezra
and Ronald Duncan: *

KENNEDY'S WIN
'T'HE United States Presidential and
A Congressional elections went much
as most prophets expected, after a
record vote and a paradoxical cam-
paign in which the Democrat candi-
dates, attracting the Labor and Left-
wing vote, were millionaires and the
Republicans were not.
It was a campaign calculated to stir
some uneasiness. The weight of money,
the TV appeal of the contestants, the
vast organisation and ballyhoo and the
submersion of real issues to curiously
immaterial ones, all seemed to obscure
the facts about what each side was
fighting for, or supposed to be fighting
for. Also obscured was the real
capacity of the candidates, except in
their roles as p.-r.-men and publicity-
agents.
Judging by the reactions of some
female voters, the fight centred round
the looks and glamor of the candidates.
And going by the lines taken by the
candidates themselves towards the end
of the fight the most important ques-
tion to be argued was whether or not
the United States had lost prestige
abroad during the Eisenhower regime.
Senator Kennedy declared, “State
Department polls on our prestige and
influence round the world have shown
such a sharp drop that up till now the
State Department has been unwilling
to release them.” The Republicans
alleged that* the Democrats were
merely crying stinking fish in their
willingness to go to any length in
damaging the national reputation in
order to win a victory. The argument
was dressed in ticker-tape, orchestrated
with yells and seeded with charges and
bomb-scares.
What real issues there were mostly
turned on the personal opinion of the
electors formed of the candidates in a
campaign of lavish expenditure, pub-
licity, intensive organising in every
corner of the country and sheer sound
and fury.
On about everything that mattered
about foreign affairs the adversaries
agreed materially. Their differences
were largely concerned with method of
approach to problems of foreign
relationships, especially with Russia,
and about how to operate the leader-
ship of the Western world and the
American comity of nations.
Each opponent vied with the other
in promising to be firmer with Khrush-
chev and Castro than the other. But
each at various stages reached a point
at which he felt the need either to
freeze into immobility or back-pedal
from a potent accusation of tactless
provocativeness.
STRONG influences such as industrial
unrest following the steel strike,
unemployment in coalmining, general
depression in West Virginia, unease
about the international situation which
Khrushchev had been far from unskil-
ful in projecting into the minds of
voters favored Kennedy.
The slide towards his side became
the greater with recession in business,
the disturbance of the gold market and
the very evident drift of world influ-
ence, both financial and political, away
from Washington with its aged Presi-
dent and its sick and not very forceful
Secretary of State.
The result of the Presidential elec-
tion of 1956 had been paradoxical. It
turned entirely on the popularity of
President Eisenhower. In a year in
which Congress, as it had been in every
year for a long time except for 1952,
was elected with a Democrat majority
in both Houses, the retiring President,
ill and going for his second term, won
in a landslide.
The win was all the more remarkable
because in that campaign the Demo-
crats held up Mr. Nixon, the Republi-
can Presidential candidate’s stable-
mate, as one of the main reasons why
his leader should be defeated. He was
held to be a handicap no President
could carry.
The campaign in 1956, however, was
abnormal. General Eisenhower went
to the polls with even the Russians
applauding his desertion of the United
Kingdom and France in the Suez
affair, and with the whole of the
United States convinced that, by
humiliating the United Kingdom in
particular, he had established the
domination of Washington over world
politics and made his country not
merely the greatest nation on earth,
as it had long claimed to be, but also
the dictator of global politics.
'T'HE interval has seen great changes
A both in the reputation of the
retiring President and Mr. Nixon and in
that of the United States abroad. The
chickens of Suez have come home to
roost in Panama, whose Government

of a Democrat-controlled Congress-
placed the Republicans on the defen-
sive in the Presidential and Congres-
sional campaign.
\ jj
CEEING that over the past 30 yea
the Democratic party majority ha
been a normal feature of United State
politics, and that it is the party that
feeds on recession, it seems remarkable
indeed, in the light of the history of
the past four years, that Nixon has
done as well as he has.
The Democrats have won a huge
majority in the House of Representa-
tives and an almost two-to-one
majority in the Senate, with the “advice 1
and consent” of which the Presiden
carries out some of his most importan
functions, including foreign attain
administration. '

PLAIN ENGLISH
Odd Man Out
At a time when overseas countries were
taking (or about to take) firm anti-
inflationary measures, apparently with
the trend of world markets clearly
in view, Australia, during the
second half of 1959, embarked on a
course of renewed inflation through its
arbitration-court awards. Principal of
these was the “margins” award late in
the year.
Earlier in the same year Federal M.Ps.
had voted themselves large salary-
increases, and there had been a 155.-a-
-week basic-wage rise in June.
In January of this year, following
closely on the “margins” decision, there
was a 6 p.c. increase in the price of steel.
Then off went the costs spiral generally.
There was a show of concern by the
Federal Ministry. There were exhorta-
tions to industry to “absorb” the
increased costs. But profit-margins,
overall, are already too low to create the
capital that is necessary for Australian
development, and capital-erosion through
inflation and Federal taxation policy is a
notorious feature of our economy.
A more rational measure was the Gov-
ernment’s decision to oppose, in court,
a further rise in the basic wage.
The Bulletin commented in January
this year:
It would be wrong indeed to
attempt to “correct” the inflationary forces
set in motion by wage-increases not accom-
panied by greater productivity simply by
raising taxation and hoping to drain-off
increased spending-power that way. More
serious than demand-inflation at the moment
is cost-inflation. Costs won’t be reduced
through raising taxation. And lowering of
import-barriers won’t reduce prices very
far when wages remain fixed.
High economic policy in Australia for
the past year seems to have been naive
and strangely light-hearted. It would
appear that the various powers-that-be
have taken the booming Stock Exchanges
as evidence of great industrial prosperity.
But one has only to look at the yields
obtainable from leading industrial shares —
some around 2 p.c.—to realise how far out
of line share prices are with company-
dividends and, by the same token, profits.
Now Treasurer Holt is forced to admit
that things have become serious in Aus-
tralia. Inflationary pressures are “tending
to strengthen” and overseas funds are
running low.
The Government will this week dis-
cuss Australia’s problems, and an
announcement is expected with regard to
counter-measures.
Australia will always have crises of the
present kind so long as the export indus-
tries are regarded almost as a foreign
affair when wage-rates are determined,
and while the Treasury, in its taxation
policy, acts without imagination and a
co-operative regard for the problems of
industry.
It has appeared to count the immediate
cost of any taxation concession as an
irreparable loss to revenue, and not one
that, where it gives material stimulus to
industry, will more than repay the
Treasury through increased productivity
and greater national income.
The Bulletin has pointed out before
that it is time the Treasury realised that,
in an age where Government revenues are
of such proportions that they are one of
the most influential factors in the opera-
tions of a nation’s industries, it is not
merely the job of the Treasury to collect
and protect the revenue. It also has a
major responsibility in protecting the
economy, with a regard to individual
equities as well as large round national
sums.
Our present crisis has been largely
created —over many years—within the
arbitration system and the Federal
Treasury. It has now been exposed by
the fall in overseas prices for our exports
in the face of rising costs, and by the
demands made by a large-scale immigra-
tion policy.
Unpleasant Facts
[From Canberra]
It is most unlikely that the Com-
monwealth Government will reintroduce
import-licensing as a means of meeting
the worrying upsurge in overseas expen-
diture of recent months.
Although one section of Cabinet
believes this course is inevitable, another
section, led by Trade Minister John
McEwen, is dead-set against it.
However, the Government is reported
to be ready to announce other means
to control imports—means which will be
just as effective as licensing and which
will have a second by-product of curbing
the growing rate of hire - purchase
business.
In a three-day series of meetings last
week, Cabinet faced the unpleasant fact
that overseas spending was proceeding
at far too great a rate for financial com-
fort, and unless some curb was effected
now—not in a few months —Australia’s
international reserves would fall by more
that £2OO million by next June.
In the first four months of this finan-
cial year, Australia has already recorded
a trade deficit of almost £ll3 million,
compared with a surplus of £4 million
in the same four months of last year.
With overseas markets for primary
products becoming harder to find, and
with no rise in wool prices likely, the
only way for Australia to meet her com-
mitments will be to cut down on the
amount of money going out in payments
for imports.
It is believed the Reserve Bank has
already instructed the private banks to
fuither restrict credit for imports, but
the credit-squeeze has not been “tight”
enough.
The Government now feels that if the
banks will not act strongly enough, it
will have to take over the problem itself.
Proposals considered by Cabinet last
week, and which could be announced
by Treasurer Holt in a White Paper this
week, include:
An increase in sales-tax on “luxury
goods” motor-vehicles and household
appliances (TV, 'refrigerators, etc.) —of 15
p.c.
Increase in the overdraft interest-rate.
Increase in the bond-rate.
A 15 p.c. increase in sales-tax on
motor-vehicles would raise th*
40 p.c., and would mean L h rate to
Price of the averagemi- mcreasc »
saloon of up to £l20 §e medium - Priced
This would put a motor-car ,•,
reach of many people at nr Slde the
plating purchLTTteS °*>
A sales-tax increase on other
both locally produced and imported
would again set-up buyer-rS o
resulting in less money
expenditure on these items, and a let
ing of the demand on funds for overset
purchases. ws
A rise in the overdraft rate would make
it harder for many people to borrow
irom banks to finance overseas purchases
while an increase in the bond-rate would
attract more money into Government
securities and away from the h.-p com-
panies.
Khrushchev's Hopes
The first external reaction from Senator
Kennedy’s election as President came
from Khrushchev.
He lost not a minute in putting his
seal of approval on the election. Having
refused to deal with President Eisen-
hower, obviously in the hope that this
would influence the vote in the Demo-
crats’ favor, he is ready now to deal with
the new man in the cause of “peace.”
He hopes for a return of the trends
exhibited during the later period of
Franklin Roosevelt’s Administration.
That is certainly one matter about which
he is sincere.
Another Yalta of the kind which gave
him the means to arm the Red Chinese,
acquire the spoils of the Japanese war
without fighting, or even assisting in
it, plus half Korea and numerous foot-
holds from which he has subverted much
of the world, might well be coveted by
Khrushchev. And so might a U.S. State
Department well seeded with Alger Hisses
and their kind, with a flood of Rosen-
bergs and espionage experts of the Com-
munist bloc hanging on the doorstep ot
U.S. nuclear projects.
There is no sign that Kennedy has
any intention of adopting a milder line
in foreign affairs. A clearer line, pernap
—but if anything harder and m
definite, while being at the same 1
conciliatory. , •, ;<
What Kennedy has so far said i

fact that his proposal to send s
Stevenson to Nato while the ReP 1 - 1 uj s

sMelbourne, that citadel of sacrosanct
lands, now stand exposed as un-
ftant park-grabbers no lesser Mel-
ons than Menzies, Calwell, Bolte
Mother diverse types, this time all in

They are members of the Melbourne
to Ground Trustees who have
feted a move by the Melbourne
to Club for the alienation of a strip
i land of about half-an-acre from
fcont Park so that the Ross Grey-
®h stand and its environs at the

The proposal is to spend £600,000 on

T' e in which it has sprung
some recent legislation, had the bill
already prepared.
With this disclosure the Premier then
emerged as a champion of the grab,
apparently on the simple premise that
if the club wanted to extend to parkland
it should be entitled to do so, as did
Arthur Calwell, who is the trustees’
chairman. The Prime Minister said
nothing. He has enough on his plate.
It is true that additional service could
be given to that section of the public
which patronises the M.C.G. and more
could be accommodated on a grand-final
football day once a year or at an excit-
ing Test-match much less frequently.
Many new M.C.C. members couid also
be admitted, according to the M.C.C.,
although no definite undertaking has
been given or hint to win their support.
It is also true that if all the worthy
causes for which parklands had been
sought in Melbourne in the last few
decades had succeeded there would now
be very few open acres left.
New Zealand Elections
[From “New Zeal”]
So far the election campaign in N.Z. has
been as lifeless as a bulldozer on a wet
Sunday.
With no £lOO tax-bribe to offer, the
Labor platform had only minor induce-
ments (promise of tax-adjustments,
increased war-pensions and so on). The
National party is wary with offers of
“sound progressive government and no
reckless promises.”
Pleased to note also that Holyoake
offers “new zeal for New Zealand.” I
take this as a personal compliment to
the pen-name I have been using in The
Bulletin for some time.
Walter Nash lacks his old-time fire,
which is not surprising, seeing that he is
nearing the eighties. He has, however,
raised a high-voiced protest from the
daughter of the late Bob Semple, a hard-
hitting member of the first Labor
Ministry. Nash said that after meeting
Khrushchev he regarded him as “the
nearest approach to Bob Semple of any-
one I have met.” Bob’s daughter was
“astounded and hurt” over the compari-
son.
Hardly likely, however, to cause any
further fractures in the Labor party.
General opinion is that N.Z. voters,
having short memories except for the
recent abounding prosperity of the coun-
try, may be inclined to vote Labor back
to power. At all events, a close contest
is anticipated.
Crisis Background
The Federal Government finds itself in
an unhappy politico-economic position
because of world economic changes,
short-sighted economic and industrial
policy and its own failures.
In all the circumstances, and having
regard to the effects of the Government’s
anti-inflation policies and measures —
support for a brake on credit, use of
Government influence to check the rise
on the basic wage, the provision for a
surplus in the 1960 Budget and some
loading of taxation as check on spending
and lifting of import-restrictions—Aus-
tralia is weathering what storm there is
fairly well.
The dangerous factors are the low
price of wool against a background of
high basic land-values, increasing costs
of materials, labor and freights, and the
prospective increasing pressures caused
by big wage - rises which have no
earthly rhyme or reason in the present
economic set-up.
That the supreme union body of the
Commonwealth, the A.C.T.U., should be
supporting, and even pushing forward,
the move initiated by the Communists
for a 35-hour week and sundry wage-
rises on top of the margins award, of
which the full effect has not yet been felt,
seems lunatic.
But since Mr. Jim Healy, of the Com-
munist party and Waterside Workers’
Federation, seems to have replaced
Albert Monk as its spokesman while the
latter is away junketing on the Continent
preparatory to welcoming a Russian
trade - delegation at the Australian
workers’ expense, the A.C.T.U. attitude
is at least explainable.
As argued by the Metal Trades and
the Graziers, circumstances call for more
work per man and per £ paid for wages
in industry rather than less work.
Cheap Land—For Some
With one of those blinding flashes of
brilliance with which it from time to
time convinces itself of its own genius
the N.S.W. Cabinet has discovered a
solution for the high cost of home-sites.
It proposes to go into the real-estate
and subdivision business purely, of
course, on a non-profit basis. The plan,
as announced by Housing Minister
Landa, is to set up a corporation, within
the Housing Commission, to acquire
land and sell it to people who want to
build homes. Suitable land is to be
bought at Valuer-General’s valuation,
subdivided into home-sites and sold to
“genuine homeseekers.”
This seems to be a completely un-
warranted adventure in Government
trading. It cannot be denied that high
prices for land are a feature of the boom
Sydney, like other Australian cities, has
been enjoying (or suffering) in the past
decade. Large fortunes have been made
out of land-subdivisions and some of the
biggest windfalls have come as a result
of the Government’s frequent changes
of Green Belt policy. In this last respect
some people have been extraordinarily
lucky; others have shown amazing
prescience in buying land just before
rezoning.
The present plan seems to be no more
than a window-dressing stunt, out of
which a fortunate few may get blocks
of land at below market price. One
assurance that has been given seems
hardly necessary—that the project will
be run on non-profit lines. That will put
it in the same class as the Railways and
other N.S.W. Government ventures.

“A ND IT'S PRINTED

Tt’s on again, the planning for
the annual Christmas exodus from
city to beach-house, flat, caravan, or
tent. Three family-heads I know are
already fixed-up: the first has taken a
house with all mod. cons, at a socially-
whirling resorts. “I can’t stick the place,
but with a wife and three daughters, I
haven’t any choice,” he says, gloomily
chewing a pipe. The second has booked
a shack, minus cons, ancient or mod.,
facing a mud-flat of an estuary where
the fishing is of the most rewarding.
“The wife and kids don’t care for it” —
with a shrug—“but it’s my holiday, after
all.” The third is checking camping-
gear for a variety of coastal pitches.
“It’s the finest holiday of all; and Mum
and the kids just revel in it,” he com-
ments with a satisfied grin. Yes, Dad
No. 1 is English, Dad No. 2 of Conti-
nental lineage, and Dad No. 3, naturally,
a pioneer’s grandson.—“ Roomy.”

“Curate’s Egg”: The yarn circulating
in Melbourne is probably apocryphal.
Police public-relations boys picked from
among hundreds of schoolchildren’s
essays the one which summed things up
in three words: “Police is b s!”
They, under Commissioner’s orders,
picked up the brand from the burning.
They filled it to the ears with ice-cream,
allowed it to operate the controls at
H.Q. radio, try out the weapons-range,
drive prowl-wagons and harbor-launches,
see the rogues’ gallery, and even luxuriate
in the morgue. Then they sent it back
to write another essay. It spread itself
to four words: “Police is cunning

“The trend overseas was to make chain-

Williams, a founder of Woolworths (Australia).
‘The days of “Nothing oyer two-and-six” are
gone,’ he said.”
When that it was and a few little bricks,
With hey, ho, the store on the chain,
There was nothing over two-and-six,
For the chain it reigneth every day.
But when it became a great estate,
With hey, ho, the store on the chain,
The old half-dollar went out of date,
For the chain it reigneth every day.
And since when a man was a little tiny
boy,
With hey, ho, the store on the chain,
Today’s half-dollar is but a toy,
For the chain it reigneth every day.
So that’s all one, the song is done,
With hey, ho, the store on the chain,
And “Nothing is Over’’ is over and gone,
And they’ll strive to please you every
day.

“Strue”: Yes! The right side is the
right side to milk a cow (B. 26/10/’6O).
Some years ago we had a Jersey cow
which liked to be milked in the paddock,
but didn’t worry who milked her; when
or what side, it was all the same to
Gertie. She also liked to chew the cud
in time to the milking; slow milking
meant slow chewing, fast meant fast
chewing. The twins, being perfect little
devils, would get one each side of her
and milk furiously, then nearly die laugh-
ing at the old girl’s efforts to keep up
with them. Another trick of theirs was
to lie under her and gently stroke her
tummy. Head up, eyes closed, she would
slowly chew the cud, with a look of
asinine delight on her phizog.
“Swagi”: Par. about school-attendance
medals (B. 5/10/’6O) reminds me of an

hygiene? Naturally she doesn’t want it

Kenneth Neate made on his return to

musical activity of the district of 20 to

the eisteddfods had almost disappeared:
Abermain’s was now the only eisteddfod
from Newcastle to Tamworth. Neate said
the Hannell Choral Society in Newcastle,
the Kurri Orpheus Choir and the Com-
bined Coalfields Choir had in their day
presented great oratorios and concerts.
He was in no way reflecting on the
valuable work of Newcastle Conser-
vatorium and the several musical bodies
presenting light opera and musical
comedy and some opera ; his comment
was inspired by his affection and con-
cern for music in the entire Newcastle
and coalfields area.

Human skin is an exceedingly tough

Eyeing this unbelievable sight, he could

It seems King George VI was sheltering

afterwards ordered drinks. The servants

?Hlad ;V W yndham that
k Kshad seen two white
men on the beach near Cape
Bernier.
Sutcliffe, of the old West
Australian Airways, immedi-
ately did a patrol along that
stretch of coastline and located
the flying-boat. Captain Crane,
port pilot, and Constable Roy
Goad shot out straight away
in the pilot-launch.
All reputable authorities be-
tween Police Fleadquarters in
Perth and the front bar of the
Six Mile pub at Wyndham
agreed that the flyers 6y this
time> would either have been
done-in by the blacks or have
starved to death; but as a
gesture of courtesy to such a
friendly country as the German
Democratic Republic it was
decided that the remains, at
least, must be found and
brought in.
A land-party was ordered
to be concentrated at Forrest
River Mission in case the sea-
borne patrol had no success.
To strengthen this land-party—
on paper—it was decided to
engage a stray bagman with a
few horses of his own to go
with Constable Gordon Mar-
shall. I was the stray bagman.
T was engaged at five in the
evening; that night the
police plant was with my own
at the old Nine Mile; next
morning I was on the way to
the Forrest Mission, which,
though only a* short distance
from Wyndham straight across
the Gulf, is a slow 140 miles
away by horseback.
Gordon was at the Mission,
having come over by launch.
As time in those parts often
depends on tide, arrangements
had been made for Jack
Christie, the radio-station
operator, to broadcast any
relevant messages which one
of the Mission lay brothers
would pick-up on his crystal-
set.
While we were waiting
for news of the launch-party
we were kept busy shoeing
horses and packing gear. It
was the best-equipped and best-
victualled camp I have ever
been in ; the snag, of course,
was how we could carry it all.
It came to an average of well
over 2501 b. per load ; one
buckjumping mule earned her-
self a full 3cwt.
The launch-party located the
flying-boat, less half of one
float, and a message informed
us that the crew, using this as
a canoe, had left, travelling
west.
I would have written them
off even as discoverable corpses
there and then ; the only thing
more treacherous than the tides
along that coast are the hidden
reefs. The only things more
voracious than the coastal
sharks are the estuarian croco-
diles and maybe the octopi.
I was sure of at least six
months’ work before the search
was abandoned —-or so I
thought.
A T this point some old grand-
*** mother in the bush blacks’
camp produced a story of two
white men being speared by
her tribe while gathering wild
grapes near the mouth of the
Lynde River. Chief execu-
tioner, she claimed, was one
Bungi (pronounced Bung Eye).
Bungi happened to be the
leader of a half-dozen potential
pathfinders the Mission staff
had selected to pilot us to the
vicinity of the beached flying-
boat, which was a long way
from the Lynde River. It was
an awkward one for Gordon
to decide.
The old girl, speaking
through a half-caste lass as in-
terpreter, was quite definite.
The general appearance of
Bungi added credence to her
story. But to make for the
Lynde was outside the terms of
Gordon’s orders, and if the
yarn had no truth it might
leave us with footsore horses

POLITICAL POINTS
his retirement President Eisen-
hower has chosen a Gettysburg
address.
• •
Various explanations have been given
for the Kennedy victory, but the close-
ness of the result suggests that the factor
which clinched it was the efficiency and
drive of Kennedy’s campaign which
gained him first the Democratic nomina-
tion and then the key of the White House.
• •
Kennedy’s majority in the popular
vote (about 250,000) was described as
the narrowest since Wilson’s (591,385).
That’s rather understating the position.
In the 1916 election fewer than 18 million
people voted ; last week the tally was
over 66 million. Kennedy secured 50.2
per cent, of the votes, Nixon 49.8 per
cent. For a straight-out fight that’s the
closest ever. Three times, however, a
President has been elected on a minority
vote: Lincoln, in 1860, when Breckin-
ridge split the Democratic vote with
Douglas ; Cleveland in 1892 (opponents,
Republican Harrison and Peoples’-party
Weaver) and Wilson in 1912, when Teddy
Roosevelt, running as a Progressive, took
4-million votes from the Republican
camp, leaving the then President Taft
trailing the field.
• •
Australian Reds are represented at the
world congress of the Communist party
in Moscow by their president, R. Dixon,
and their general-secretary and real boss,
Lance Sharkey. Dixon has had a heart
attack—a disease common in Moscow
among Communist bosses —and will not
take part. Sharkey will be very silent
about his part. A conference of this
kind might involve conspiracy against
the Commonwealth and its allies and
come within the ambit of the Crimes Act.
• •
Probably no other Governor-General
travelled so widely throughout Australia
as Field-Marshal Lord Slim; certainly
no other absorbed the Australian view-
point so well. In London last week he
spoke out strongly in favor of the White
Australia policy—a subject few people in
England really understand.
Slim also put in a word for the Aus-
tralian accent —“far better than the
super-duper 8.8. C. accent.” He said that
he had travelled all over Australia and
could always understand every word. But
in England “I have only to go 200 miles
and I can’t understand what a chap is
saying.”
No community likes “to draw the
crabs” on itself by having nuclear bases
on its doorstep; every missile-defence
station in the U.S. has to contend with
the hostility of the local population who
want to know why it can't be put some-
where else. Such fears are quite under-
standable, but Governments have to site
their bases at the most suitable points
and placate local opposition as best they
can.
The Polaris submarine-base on Holy
Loch, near Glasgow, is a case in point
and Prime Minister Macmillan gave the
only possible reply when he was asked
in the Commons why the base couldn’t
be placed in some other Nato country.
He said: “We cannot wriggle out of our
responsibilities by saying, ‘Let us put it
in Holland, France, Germany or Italy
and then they will suffer.’ We had far
better exercise our influence by playing
our full part in the alliance.”

The Government does not propose
to call . its White Paper on the
‘•economic crisis” a “supplementary
Budget, but it is expected to be just as
effective—and almost as harsh-as the
1956 “Little Budget” which the Govern-
ment was forced to introduce because
of difficulties in financing imports, It
would be a serious blow to Harold Holt’s
prestige to have to introduce a “supple-
mentary Budget” so soon after the
original 1960-61 Budget, and for this
reason, if for no other, it will merely
be referred to as a White Paper.
It is understood that Parliament,
scheduled to adjourn for Christmas on
November 24, will now be kept in session
until mid-December to enable the
Government’s proposals to be put into
operation.

“New Zeal” discusses a Maori
prophet:
Although he has been dead over 20 years
the influence of Wiremu Ratana, Maori
“miracle man,” lives on. The Ratana Church
he founded continues to dominate the selec-
tion of Labor Parliamentary candidates. The
first signal victory of Ratanism was in 1939,
when its influence deprived the Maori people
of the representation of Sir Apirana Ngata.
On more than one occasion since then the four
Maori candidates, all Ratana selections, have
held the balance of power in the New Zealand
Parliament. This position again threatens in
the general election at the end of this month
as another close contest is expected between
Labor and the Nationalists. Ratana’s boast
■ that he would control “the four winds” (the
four Maori seats) may become true once more.
This is not to the advantage of the Maori
people, who have been debilitated morally and
physically by the vote-catching favors showered
on them. Although he has not spoken in
these words, Pei te Hurinui Jones, Nationalist
candidate and scholar of distinction, says that
in the present situation there appears to be no
possibility of a non-Ratana Maori being selected
as an official Labor candidate; the Parliamen-
tary representation is confined to the members
of the Ratana Church, “the leadership of which
is at its lowest ebb.” The younger Maoris
are perturbed, but may yet rise to the occasion.
In the ’twenties Ratanism soared to the skies
like a gorse-fire. With a party of 40 Maoris
Ratana toured the world seeking international
recognition of the Treaty of Waitangi. In
frock-coats and top-hats they tried to interview
King George V. They appeared before the
League of Nations in full Maori dress. Their
tour was in vain. At home Ratana refused
to be interviewed or photographed. He had
a bodyguard of Maori policemen and arrived
one day in Wellington with a brass band and
a large retinue of followers. He predicted
that one day his gift of healing would depart.
It did, but there still remains at Ratana pah
a huge collection of crutches and walking-
sticks as testimony of the days when he did
exert strange powers among those who believed
in him.

Alfred Hill's contribution to Austra-
lian culture was not limited to his
versatility as musician and composer.
Few of his later friends may have known
that in 1912 he was prime mover in the
formation of Sydney’s first Repertory
Society, with Dave Souter, of Bulletin
“cat” fame, Sydney Stirling and Fred
Aarons as his helpers.
After a short season of Hill’s musical
comedy, “The Moorish Maid,” the
Repertory Society produced “The Devil’s
Disciple” and “Mid-channel” at the old
Criterion Theatre in Pitt Street. The
casts included some prominent profes-
sional actors and actresses, as well as a
number of amateurs, many of whom
later became professionals and had rea-
son to be grateful for the encouragement
they had received from this theatre-loving
man of music.
Knight of the Garter, Lord Lieutenant
for the East Riding of Yorkshire, Chan-

of the Yorkshire Insurance Company,
former officer in Hodson’s Horse, farmer
and landowner, Michael Guy Percival
Willoughby, 11th Baron Middleton,
passed through Sydney last week in the
course of a world business-tour.
Lord Middleton was gazetted to the
10th Lancers (Hodson’s) from Sandhurst
in 1907, served in Mesopotamia and
elsewhere in War I (winning the M.C.),
then went back to India, until he retired
from the Indian Army in 1923 to study
estate - management. He succeeded his
father in 1924, took command of a
Territorial battalion of the Green
Howards, and interested himself in busi-
GARTER
ness and county affairs until the duplica-
tion of the Territorial Army just before
War 11, when he raised and commanded
the sth Bn., East Yorkshire Regiment.
Debarred from a fighting command on
the score of age he voluntarily stepped-
down in rank in order to qualify for the
next-best thing—a worth-while staff-job.
Posted to 13 Corps h.q., he served in
Egypt, Sicily and Italy, then became
Deputy Chief of Staff, Allied Military
Government, first in Algiers and later
in France.
While in Australia he has been seeing
all he can of the universities and dis-
cussing with their chancellors problems
of mutual interest. Veterinary research
is another matter that has his attention
—not so much in Australia, where he
thinks it is adequately handled, but in
the U.K., where nothing like so many
facilities exist.

Yielding at last to his doctor’s
persuasions to call it a day, Ray Ormes,
for many years head of The Bulletin
composing-room, is the paper’s oldest
inhabitant, and his genial nature has
made him one of the best-liked denizens
of 252 George Street. Fifty-three years
is a long stint of service, but that’s how
long it is since Ray came to the paper’s
earlier address after getting his first
smudges of printer’s ink as reader’s
assistant with John Sands when that firm
was printing the early Australian paper-
backs for the N.S.W. Bookstall Co. He
was really born to the game, though—-
his father ran a paper at Grenfell
(N.S.W.) in goldrush days when the
nearby Emu Creek field was booming.
Jimmy Edmond was editor when Ray
came to The Bulletin, and S. H. Prior,
father of the present managing-director,
had just come down from Broken Hill
to take-over the “Wild Cat” pages from
Edmond. Ray rates Edmond the most
brilliant journalist he ever met —an
opinion shared by former editor J. E.
Webb.
In his 50-odd years among the lino-
types Ray took the changes of changing
times in his stride —possibly helped in
this by the fact that in his younger days
there were few roller-skaters in Sydney
to equal him. Outside working - hours
he has had a host of interests, generally
connected with civic affairs. For several
years he was president of the Cammeray
Progress Association (which is a p.a.
that really lives up to its title) and he
also held office as president of the North
Sydney Federation of Progress Associa-
tions. At the last municipal elections he
stood for his ward in the North Sydney
Council. Didn’t get the decision, but ran
very close and thoroughly enjoyed the
fight.
In recent months ill-health has slogged
Ray hard, but he’s back on his feet, with
his genial grin as evident as ever, and
looking around for good deeds to occupy
his retirement.

present appointment, which he has held
for two years, Garnsey is responsible for
maintenance of the standard of Scout
training and badging throughout Aus-
tralia. He began his interest in Scouting
20 years ago and has held many positions
on the way up—incidentally, he’s the
youngest man ever to have been awarded
the Silver Wolf. His Scouting post is
a spare-time job ; in business he’s g.-m.

he has quite a string of professional
qualifications to his name.
He told The Bulletin that one Aus-

of 11 and 18 is or has been a Scout.
There are at present 100,000 Scouts in
Australia—37,ooo of them in N.S.W. The

Jamboree, Garnsey explained, will be an
extra event; for those who do not attend
the gathering at Lansdowne, ordinary

ABORIGINALITIES
TTp to about 10 years ago it was fairly
easy for nor'-west Queenslanders to
get comparatively cheap labor from the
mission-station at Palm Island: 15s.
pocket-money for the abo., £2 10s. to
the mission for each week’s work. One
couple stayed with us for five years,
returning to the mission when my father
retired. Their advent in 1947 was
heralded by a telegram from Palm
Island, which read: “Lucy and Friday
bush. Left here 23rd.” This was inter-
preted at our end to mean that Lucy
and Friday had “gone bush” after leaving
the mission on 23rd. Inquiries were
halted when the missing couple arrived
on the mail-coach, and the “boy”
announced cheerfully: “Me Friday Bush.
What work I do tomorrow, boss?” —
“Risto.”

“Curate’s Egg”: There’s no telling what
a Torres Strait “boy” will do. I hired
Akiba, a 60-year-oldster, to build me a
fowlhouse. He assured me that he
“pinish him job altogether quick one
time,” without any supervision or assist-
ance. At sundown, when he hadn’t
turned-up to draw his ration of rope-
stick tobacco, I went to investigate. His
chookhouse was soundly enough built,
with Akiba, securely wired in, squatting
disconsolately on his haunches trying to
figure a way out of his dilemma. He’d
only forgotten to provide a door.

“Murray Swagman”: The question of

and Northern Vic. it was always a “gig.”
Then I noticed that travellers from parts
of the Riverina, and also W.A., called
it a “sulky.” In Gippsland l always

'T'he hangi turned-on when a Maori
meeting-house was lately opened at
Lower Huff (N.Z.) is claimed to have
been one of the biggest ever. A deluge
dampened neither the enthusiasm nor
the giant earth-ovens necessary for the
preparation of hangi food. The Maori
caterers managed to heat shallow pits
lined with stones, remove the fires, place
the food on the sizzling stones and cover
it in again, in pouring rain and all before
6 a.m. so that the meal would be ready
at noon. Into the 24 hangi- pits went
two bullocks, 125 sheep, 40 pigs, 200
fowls, hundreds of paua (a shellfish),
200 smoked eels, 190 sacks of mussels,
two tons of potatoes, half -a - ton of
kumara (sweet potatoes), 20 bags of
puha, 20 bags of pumpkins and 30 bags
of cabbages. The new meeting-house,
simple and dignified externally, contains
many beautiful examples of Maori carv-
ing, some specially carved for the
Centennial Exhibition of 1940, many just
completed for this new building, the
name of which is translated to mean
“Goodwill to all men.” —“Janus.”

“H.W.D.”: I came upon him sitting
smoking his pipe outside the dilapidated
tent, while his missus was slogging into
a dead tree with a blunt axe. “Pretty
hard yakka for a woman to chop that
stuff, isn’t it?” I asked. He looked up ;
then drawled: “Not really. Y’see, she
don’t stop at it that long. She works
shifts. When she gets tired choppin’ she
goes round the traps, then she does jobs
inside. That way, none of ’em gets
monotonous.”

“Q. Ree” (Fiji): The floor-show was
a Samoan fire-dance. The lights were
switched off and the young boy, dressed
in just a tiny green velvet sulu, his body
gleaming with coconut-oil, danced very
well. The burning knife was a long,
sharp, grass-knife with kerosened string
wound round and round the end. Un-
fortunately, at the very beginning of the
dance he dropped it. Although it was
a wonderful performance, the blazing
knife twirling in the air, behind his back,
around his neck, between his legs, spin-
ning from hand to hand, the women in
the audience shrank back, wondering if
he would lose it again and they would
have a long burning knife come flying
in the direction of their nylon dresses.

“0.G.”: After many years I went
back to the old town and was taken
for a Sunday-afternoon drive. Closer-
settlement had changed the whole scene.
“You remember Charlie Wilson?” I was
asked. “You know —‘Come Quickly.’ ”
Charlie’s story came back to me. His
parents had visitors. Six-year-old Charlie
galloped his pony to the front-door and
called excitedly to his younger brother,
“Come quickly ; Willie, come quickly ;
here comes a motor-car! ” Had he said,
“Quick, Bill ... . .” it wouldn’t have been
remembered. But his exact words were
repeated throughout the district, and
young Charlie became known as “Come
Quickly Wilson.” At the farm we were
warmly received. Come Quickly’s
daughter and her three children were
there. A new house had been built in
front of the old one. The old one was
now used as a garage and shed. A
room, still called the “harness-room,”
was cluttered with old motor-parts ; no
harness ; in the whole district I hadn’t
seen an animal on which harness could
be used. Come Quickly’s daughter called
us to afternoon-tea. We were enjoying
home-made scones when Come Quickly’s
five-year-old grandson rode up on his
tricycle, bounced across the veranda, and
called excitedly to his younger brother,
“Come quickly, Gregory, come quickly
—here comes a horse ! ”

the traditional slumber-shatterer—stand-
ing the clock in an empty kero.-tin.
When even that racket failed to bring
him to he bought one of those small
devices which can be set to start various
electrical appliances at given times, and
attached it to the bed-lamp and bedside-
radio. Since then he has never been
late. But what gets his goat is that as
regular as his electrical gadget, he now
never fails to wake-up five minutes before
the light switches on, the radio blares
out, and the clock begins to rattle the
kero.-tin.

A DESERT CORRIDOR
I party of W.A. scientists have found
[ a vegetation - strip, or corridor,
W the Great Victoria Desert, north
the Nullarbor Plain, which could be
tlink between the fauna-populations of
eastern and western halves of Aus-
f ,a ’ and which, even comparatively
'witly, may have been used by animals

koala’s giant ancestor, and the wombat,
and harried by what we know as the
Tasmanian-wolf and the Tasmanian-
devil?
An aspect that naturalists have long
wondered about has been to what extent
the formation of the central deserts
affected the distribution of our native
fauna —birds as well as animals, because,
while some birds fly thousands of miles
each year and others fly scores of miles
daily for a drink, there are species that
never range far from their breeding-
grounds, and which would retreat from a
desert rather than try to cross it. Others,
more adaptable, would grow used to the
dry conditions and learn to live with
the desert and within it. Almost through-
out the dry inland you’ll find an occa-
sional bird, and sometimes you’ll meet
huge flocks. These become acclimatised
gradually. Along the fringes of this
shrinking corridor? Perhaps. Then,
again, ducks banded in W.A. have been
recovered in the eastern States. Did they
circle the continent, or did they cross
the desert along a route their ancestors
followed in the last stages of the
drying-up?
It hasn’t been established how birds
first reached Australia ; but possibly they
came down from Asia, along a land-
bridge or island-chain, to our north-
eastern tip, then moved first down the
east coast and west along the south coast.
No doubt some species /Tanged further
than others, just as some do now. There
are birds in Queensland which are not
found anywhere else in Australia. So
there are in W.A. and Tasmania ; and
N.S.W. and Victoria each claim that one
of their birds is not found in any other
State. On the other hand, a great many
species occur in sou’-Western Australia
and Victoria, but not in South Australia;
and when identical species inhabit regions
climatically alike but separated by a
desert they might well have occupied the
intervening region when it enjoyed a
more equable climate, crossing it while a
part of it was still acceptable to them.
There’s one family of birds to which the
corridor-theory could well apply. This is
the scrub-bird. There are only two species
in this family the noisy scrub - bird,
taken in lower sou’-Western Australia,
and the rufous variety, found in the
coastal regions of northern N.S.W. and
southern Queensland. Probably there’s
only one species now. In spite of keen,
scientific searching the W.A. bird hasn’t
been sighted since 1889, and is generally
assumed to be extinct.
That’s a pity. It was a bird with a
robust voice—the loudest songster for
its size in Australia —a wonderful mimic
and a ventriloquist. It was distantly
allied to the lyrebird. But it was a
ground-living, ground-nesting bird, and
in any case it would have gone down
before the introduced cat and fox.
But its known existence raises two
interesting points. Why should these
species, the sole members of their family,
occur in such widely separated localities?
And if the W.A. species had become
extinct before white settlement instead
of shortly after, could it have been sug-
gested seriously that once it inhabited
that State?
From there we can go on to ask.
Did this bird, and most Australian birds
and animals, once range across the full
width of this continent, and is this newly
discovered vegetation-strip in the Great
Victoria Desert their last migratory pad?
As we learn more about our country
we may arrive at the right answer.

WOT—NO CAPITAL-GAINS?
HPhe remarkable thing about
the slump which has oc-
curred in the sharemarket
during September, October and
November is that it has been
so long delayed.
For a couple of years the
sharemarket, as a general thing,
has been chasing its own tail.
In other words, speculators
have been betting on what price
other speculators would be
prepared to pay for particular
stocks, and have not been con-
cerned so much about the
benefits a selected stock
would yield from itself through
holding as an investment.
The Bulletin has con-
sistently pointed out the dan-
gers in such an “increment-
struck” sharemarket. But it is
surprising how many people
have been prepared to argue
that, as capital-gains have been
what most people have been
seeking in their sharemarket
activity (dividend-yields to them
being of secondary importance),
the sharemarket would continue
to rise regardless of earnings-
yield to market price. In other
words, pie in the sky bye-and-
bye was their guiding-star.
Such an investment policy is
inevitably fallacious, and disas-
trous in the end.
In looking into its crystal-
ball at the end of 1959, The
Bulletin summed-up share-
market prospects for 1960 as
follows:
The sharemarket in 1960 will
be subject to the effects of a more
severe “wage-push” in the costs of
industry, and some industries, facing
increased overseas competition and
local over-capacity already, may
not be able to pass-on increased
costs, with the result that their
profits will shrink.
A factor in our expansion over
the past three years has been the
comparative stability of wages. We
are now losing that stability.
“Selectivity” in choosing invest-
ments is therefore more essential
than ever, even though the economy
is likely to remain generally expan-
sive, and particular companies may
make exceptionally good profits.
If inflation gets noticeably under
way again there may be a rush
on shares representing the stronger
industrial equities in order to
“hedge” against inflation and
“capital erosion.” But Government
authorities may take counter-
measures against any sign of run-
away inflation, and such measures,
squeezing against inflationary
increases in wages that are already
an accomplished fact, could pinch
profit-earning severely.
Government counter-moves could
also prick sharemarket buoyancy, as
in 1951-52.
As usual, a great deal will depend
on the course of overseas markets
for raw materials, particularly
those which Australia exports. No
boom in these products appears
probable on present statistics, but
an improvement on 1959 seems
generally likely, especially now that
the U.S. steel strike has been
resolved.
Upon the way the Australian
inflationary problem is handled in
1960 will partly depend how over-
seas capital will flow into the
country during the year. A com-
paratively stable economy would
continiie to attract capital. Exces-
sive inflation would produce a
threat to the exchange-rate, especi-
ally in view of the stabilising trend
of costs and prices overseas.
That opinion was offered in
the issue of December 30, 1959.
Since then the problems of
many industries have been
added to by the removal of
import- restriction, and the
balance-of-payments and the
exchange - rate are both
vulnerable.
The sharemarket, after a
minor setback in February
this year, went on to an all-
time peak on September 16.
Since then there has been a
severe fall, which at one point
was in excess of 16 p.c. There
has been some recovery in
stocks which suffered a heavier-
than -average fall, but the
market generally is still weak
and touchy.
Some shares, at present
prices, have attractions as in-
vestments, but they need seek-
ing-out on their individual
merits. And they should be
bought on the principle that the
buyer will be prepared to live
With them happily even if no
capital-gains during
the next six or twelve months,
but that he expects them to be
rewarding in themselves within
a reasonable time, when capital-
gains should follow as am*
thing. • dS a natural

The sharemarket is waitinn
on the next move from C a „
berra aimed at correcting t
position which started to drift
when the Federal M.Ps. voted
themselves large increases in
salaries in 1959. Any “con
rection” won’t be as pleasant to
investors as the lift in salaries
was to Federal members.
New Company Law
T HE proposed new Companies
Act in N.S.W. (it is in-
tended that other States will
come into line after a confer-
ence in Hobart next February)
provides for the publication of
consolidated p.-and-l. accounts
and balance-sheets, the dis-
closure of income-tax pro-
visions, disclosure of income
from outside investments (dis-
tinguishing between listed and
unlisted investments), and the
aggregate market-value of a
co.’s investments, other than
trade investments.
Prospectuses will need to
give more information than
hitherto, and a prospectus will
be necessary for certain classes
of takeovers.
There will be restrictions and
new conditions in the case of
investment - company borrow-
ings. Provisions regarding no-
liability mining cos. have been
recast. The exemption from
filing accounts by proprietary
cos. will be limited to “exempt
proprietary companies, 3 s
defined.
Remedies will be provided
for redress where a section or
the shareholders show that a
co.’s affairs are being con-
ducted in a manner oppressive
to them.

more than the average fall in
the market, and there seems to
be no particular reason for

their £1 shares into ss. counters.
Now R. Fowler. Ford Shering-

other “Ray Moore” companies
which may be worth watching
by those who like the ss. units.

Net profit for last year was J

tax was charged in either yea i
because of accumulated losses
recorded up to 1955, when the
total reached a peak of
£826,787. But if tax weri
charged at Bs. in the £ on lasl

would have been around

sent a yield to market price of

Though a small loss was
shown in 1957, over the past
four years earnings have been
generally improving, and it is
obvious that at present a very
vigorous and profitable timber
business exists within all the
deadwood of the previous
board-mill misadventure.
Since 1955 overdraft and

a reduction of £1,195,048.
In expanding its timber busi-

ALBERT TUCKER'S PAINTINGS
L Tucker has certainly

Ld with the exhibition
I (substantially the same)
L shown in London,
recently in Melbourne
Lhas arrived at David
L Sydney. His gaunt,
W symbolic Austra-
ito, eroded by our fierce
SI but unalterably reso-
ld macabre, strides
jl desert and jungle with
remarkable effect. It is
ider the paintings have
received with such high
Some of the enthusiasm
needs discounting a little. In
the first place there is the fact
that we are all liable to over-
rate Australiana in art these
days, simply because it is Aus-
traliana —a mistake still more
likely to be made by English
critics who probably think we
are all a lot of wild colonial
boys living in the desert and
to whom our wild landscapes
are news.
Australiana will always have
its special value, whether here
or abroad. It is indeed new
in art and it has national sig-
nificance. But in the long run
it is purely artistic values that
must count most. We value
Tom Roberts not merely
because he painted hold-ups
or shearing-sheds but because
he painted them with superb
finesse ; and you cannot really
value his exquisite roses in the
N. S. Wales Gallery, his lovely
portraits or even his plate of
prawns less than his horses or
his sheep.
Then there is the fact that
Tucker’s art derives so
obviously from Nolan and
Boyd—one of the paintings is
even entitled “Metamorphosis
of Ned Kelly,” and the general
idea of using some kind of
symbolic, stylised hero is
familiar in both these painters.
There is the fact, arising
from this last, that pictures
of the desert, and of explorers
and bushrangers, along with
crows and bones and dingoes,
are really becoming far too
familiar and may soon degen-
erate into just such a cliche
or convention as the gumtree
(which at least varies with
every tree) was supposed to be
in Heysen’s day. The good
paintings in this genre will
last; but much will be dis-
carded.
And finally there is the fact
that Tucker’s Australiana,
because the pictures were
painted when he was living
abroad, is much less authen-
tic than that of half-a-dozen
similar painters one could
name, from Drysdale to
Clifton Pugh. He has not
Boyd’s and Nolan’s deft and
accurate touch in suggesting,
however slightly, a genuine
Australian background: and
surely this realistic criterion
must apply in paintings that
specifically purport to depict
Australia.
Time after time, as in
“Figure in Desert,” “Explorer
Attacked by Parrots,” “Earth
and Scrub (1)” or “Leich-
hardt,” you come across a
painting that you feel would
be a most powerful contribu-
tion to this genre, if only the
sand, the gibbers, the rocks and
the jungle were “right.”
But out of all these reserva-
tions, Tucker emerges vigor-
ously and independently. His
craggy hero, if related to
Nolan’s Ned Kelly, is never-
theless his own ; a powerful
and a striking invention. His
paintings look solider than
Nolan’s. He uses his curious
techniques of sand and sack-
cloth more skilfully and
smoothly than any other Aus-
tralian artist trying the same
methods at the moment: they
are an integral part of the
painting—the painting itself, in
fact—not something stuck on.
Every now and again there
is something like the parrot in
“Explorer with Parrot” or one
or two of his “Homage to
Turner” series to bear witness
to his ability in more orthodox
techniques ; and in his two
gigantic head-studies, one of
which looks as if it were
painted in cement, a kind of
bas-relief, while the other
looks like a Maori wood-
carving, he has done something
quite extraordinary.

Other Exhibitions
Other Sydney exhibitions
look small beside Albert
Tucker’s ; but, as one re-
marked above, art depends in
the long run on quality, and
there is certainly a fine and
fetching quality in some of
Jean Appleton’s landscapes at
the Macquarie Galleries, not-
ably her flat, rocky foreshores
and waves, as in “Sea Coast”
and “Rocky Shore.” At the
moment she seems obsessed
with technique, and most of the
paintings are more a search
than an arrival.
The Watson’s Bay Wharf ex-
hibition at Hordern’s contains
the usual amiable but undistin-
guished array, among which
there are pleasant oils by Molly
Johnson and Rhys Williams
and some sensitive watercolors
by Mollie Flaxman.

did everything, in fact, that
every other celebrity in cap-
tivity doesn’t do.
Lumbering across the plat-
form like a brown grizzly-bear,
on whose general lines he
seems to be built, he joined
in the clapping of himself
which his initial appearance
touched-off, and he kept this up
every time he reappeared. It
was the custom we have seen
from the Soviet ballet and
Chinese opera, of clapping the
audience. He clapped his
accompanist Clarence Brown
—a well-merited tribute to
his beautifully sympathetic
pianism—and his assisting
artist, Janette McStay, who
played two neat brackets of
short piano-pieces. He dis-
pensed with white-tie-and-tails
in favor of soup-and-fish and
black tie. He waved his arms
and strolled around while sing-
ing. He laughed and told
stories and explained what was
coming vocally. He even had
his accompanist join him in
spiritual-duets. And he gave
two examples of poetry-read-
ing, the first of William Blake,
the second Othello’s final
speech—and did both magni-
ficently.
Like the recitations, his
songs are largely chosen to
illustrate his political beliefs.
He opened with a Negro
spiritual, “We Are Climbing
Jacob’s Ladder,” followed it
with Handel’s serene “Art
Thou Troubled,” then literally
lashed into part of the “Ode
to Joy” which comprises the
final section of Beethoven’s
gigantic Ninth Symphony—
Schiller’s poem of universal
brotherhood. In striking con-
trast was Schubert’s lovely,
fragile “Cradle Song,” for
which the singer reduced his
great voice to the tenderest
whispers.
“The Song of the Volga
Boatmen” was, of course, a
monte ; so was Moussorgsky’s
“The Orphan,” a splendid song
charged with compassion for
a wretched, shivering, starving
boy.
From such well-known
“plantation”-songs as “Ev’ry
Time I Feel de Spirit,” “Swing
Low, Sweet Chariot” and
“Joshua Fit de Battle ob
Jericho” —the last one delivered
with wonderful verve—Robe-
son turned to the Outer
Hebridean “Eriskay Love Lilt,”
the tragic “I Drew My Ship,”
the earthy “Water Boy” and a
delightful piece of East Side
toughness with a Runyonesque
flavor, “The Purest Kind of a
Guy.” One of the most deeply
moving songs, not on the pro-
gramme, which the singer gave
in Yiddish as well as English,
was like a cry of defiance from
the dead who fell under the
German machine-guns in the
ghettos of Warsaw.
The voice? As perfectly
produced as any voice could
be —which explains why at 62
its quality yet shows no slight-
est sign of wearing at the
edges. It seems to come up
from a bottomless well of
resonance, a facile, plastic
organ which the singer shapes
with rare artistry to the design
he needs. His speaking voice
is equally musical, with his
enunciation in both media
unexceptionable.

At Sydney Town Hall the
Glasgow “Dustman’s” son,
backed by a magical electric-
guitar (Les Bennetts) and a
battery of drums (Nick
Nicholls), was at his best in
unintelligible crescendos, like
a steam-whistle. He did a nice
warm Irish song, solo, and was
joined by the husband-and-
wife comedians Miki and
Griff in a very beautiful
calypso carol with a lovely
rocking accompaniment from
the string-bass (Peter Huggett).
The “Dustman” song was all
worn-out between his bore-
dom with it and efforts to
freshen it up. The ’ leader of
a Maori quartet repaired what
they have done to “O Sole
Mio” with something of the
electric effect (and not all
microphone-electricity, either)
of Caruso singing the original.

“The Lovers of Paris”
There is a curious but fas-
cinating blending of idealistic
and cynical love in this French-
made film, the lives of two
young couples, each pair un-
known to the other, flowing
along parallel lines until by a
quirk of fate they meet.
The idealistic love is between
a working-girl of Paris and a
struggling Hungarian artist;
the cynical between a wealthy
young married woman and the
lover she is keeping. The story
is simple in the extreme, and
the build-up to the ironic
climax is leisurely ; yet there
is never any flagging in
interest, so artistically have the
materials been handled.
Horst Buchholz and Romy
Schneider bring an engaging
freshness to their roles and the
Parisian scene comes up
beautifully under the color-
cameras.

higher profit, as shown in the accounts,
was written after providing £1,516,051
(up £23,937) for taxation and £2,631,311
(up £145,483) for depreciation ; but, as
in previous years, the tax provision was
reckoned after drawing on a provision
for deferred-tax (raised during the years
when special allowances were made for
initial depreciation), a net £96,000 being

Theoretical working capital at £6,052,038
was £1,355,661 higher than in the previ-
ous year. Main contributing factor to
the improvement was the issue of 7
p.c. unsecured £1 notes (up £4,538,112 at
£5,938,112), three for every ten ords. held
as at August 25, 1959, convertible on
January 30, 1965.
There are 1,400,000 £1 7 p.c.
unsecured notes due for conversion in
1961.
Restrictions on the importation of
paper and board were removed last
February and competition is increasing
from external suppliers. So far, however,
A.P.M. continues to write new records,
orders received in the current term, and
deliveries made, outshining performances
twelve months ago. But, although de-
mand for the co.’s products has been
fully maintained, “it is possible that there
will be a period of intense competition”
in the near future. The co. warns that
it “will not hesitate to invoke the proce-
dures to obtain protection against dump-
ing if this course is considered necessary.”
A.P.M. is engaged in one of the great
growth industries of modern times. Con-
sumption of paper, world-wide and in
Australia, is expected to double in the
next 15 years. The co. envisages “further
issues to obtain funds and details of
these will be announced at the appro-
priate time.” Meantime the present state
of the share-market poses an opportune
moment to acquire stocks in A.P.M. on a

Australian National Industries, Ltd.
/’'Operating through six main sub-
sidiaries, Australian National Indus-
tries, Ltd., is engaged in manufacturing
and merchandising engineering products,
recovering of metal and used machinery
and distributing motor-vehicles.
The group’s products include drop-
and press-forgings, precision-machinery
components, special steels, re-rolled sec-
tions, etc.
The major subsidiaries are:
Australian Forge and Engineering Pty,
Astra Engineering Pty.
John McGrath Motors Pty.
J. and C. Johnson Bros. Pty.
National Forge Pty.
Perkins Steel and Engineering Pty.
A.N.l.’s organisation is pivoted on
Lidcombe (a Sydney industrial suburb)
and has wide inter-State connections.
Motor-vehicles distributing is based on
a Ford franchise, covering' the Consul,
Prefect, Anglia and Thames.
The drastic reorganisation of A.N.l.’s
structure, with personnel changes, in
February, 1959, has improved the group’s
earning-capacity. Last term profits re-
covered and the dividend was resumed.
But it is necessary to reduce costs further
by increasing efficiency and output-
capacity.
During the year, assets of the sub-
sidiary Melbourne Iron and Steel Mills
Pty. in Victoria were sold to a subsidiary
of Cyclone Co. of Australia, Ltd., as it
was decided that the Victorian market
and supply of raw materials are inade-
quate to support both groups.
By way of contrast, A.N.I. bought-out
J. and C. Johnson Bros. Pty. (a Mel-
bourne scrap metal-processing firm) last
February. Purchase consideration in-
cluded 147,646 A.N.I. ss. ords. This lifted
A.N.l.’s paid capital to £2,536,911.
The buildings in Sydney’s Castlereagh
and Elizabeth Streets, and “some minor
properties,” were sold. A new water-
front site was acquired in South Mel-
bourne as part of the Johnson Bros,
takeover. These assets-movements re-
sulted in capital-profits which were used
for a £188,200 net reduction in intan-
gibles.
Regrouping within the A.N.I. organisa-
tion is said to have been completed.
Increased profitability, higher sales and
improved liquidity are reported.
Group turnover has reached the fore-
cast £ 12-million level, representing a 20
p.c. increase over the previous corre-
sponding period.
Consolidated net profit for the year
ended July 31, 1960, was £238,933 higher
at £257,226 after setting-aside £184,329
for depreciation (up £19,280) and pro-
viding £49,119 for taxation (up
£44,051):

This was equivalent to an earning-rate

compared with 0.7 p.c. in the previous
term, 3.3 p.c. in 1958 and 6.7 p.c. in
1957. The small tax-provision may be
due to former losses incurred within the
group.
The 6} p.c. div.-rate (passed a year

£163,976 and was well covered. Reserves

W. T. Coggins Holdings,
Ltd.
YV7. T. COGGINS, energetic
W and prosperous Sydney-
based motor-vehicles distribu-
tor, had the most successful
year to date. Consolidated net
profit soared by 57 p.c. Share-
holders received an extra 5 p.c.
div.-“bonus,” making the total
cheque for the year 20 p.c.
This was very comfortably
covered.
Established 17 years ago,
W. T. Coggins Holdings, Ltd.,
is a Sydney Metropoli-
tan distributor of Holden
and Bedford passenger and
commercial motor - vehicles.
Public status was assumed in
1954. Headquarters are in
Camperdown, with branches in
Mascot and Auburn (all Syd-
ney suburbs).
Much of Coggins’ present
opulence is a tribute to the
near-magic trade-name of
Holden, which still heads the
list as Australia’s most popular
car. The new-model Holden
was introduced last January,
“and was so well received that
for some months there was a
waiting-list.”
Competition was severe and
distribution-costs were higher.
But the mounting sales of
Holdens and good turnover in
Bedford vans and trucks (an-
other G.M. product) pushed-
up earnings to a record level.
Sales of spare-parts and acces-
sories continued to increase.
The buoyant market and
substantially higher volume of

UNWISDOM BAY
By MARGARET TRIST
There was a song just then
which had the words:
“Sweethearts who came
and vanished away.”
“How true that is,” Mrs.
Siddons said. “How true!
You will know some day,
Tansy. Won’t she, Ruby?”
Mrs. Siddons had a gramo-
phone in the kitchen and she
played the song over and over
while she and Aunt Ruby
listened and the brisket for
Mr. Siddons’s tea bubbled away
in a pot on the stove. When
Mr. Siddons was a boy his
mother had cooked brisket and
onion-sauce most evenings and
Mr. Siddons clung to the habit.
It didn’t make for variety in
life, Mrs. Siddons said.
Tansy usually leant out the
window and looked at the green
triangle of Unwisdom Bay,
the headland ending in a point
that ran out into the water.
Silly as it might seem now,
Unwisdom Bay in those days
was occupied by only the low
white-washed buildings of the
dairy-farm, the boatshed, a
wedge-shaped two-story build-
ing that was a shop which
opened only on Sundays for
the benefit of picnic parties,
and a few cottages hidden
amongst the trees.
Tansy was happy just to look
at it and the little blue bay
below, while into her dream-
ing wove the nostalgia of older
people for vanished lovers, and
the smell of the brisket broiling
which was, after all, Mr. Sid-
dons’s nostalgia for lost boy-
hood.
Tansy had a small nostalgia
of her own for her own people
and her own home far away in
another State, but she had an
excitement that was larger than
the nostalgia, for the days that
lay ahead and the unexplored
city that was now her home.
The song and the brisket were
to remain part of her memory
of those sunny autumn days
after she first came to Sydney.
As yet she had no friends of
her own age. Her search for a
girl called Cassandra Money-
penny, whom she had known
the last time she was in Sydney,
10 years ago when she was
seven, led her to reject other
young people who were pre-
sented for her favor.
“I warn you, Tansy,” Aunt
Ruby said, “You won’t find
her. Those Moneypennys were
shiftless. -They could be any-
where by this. And I warn
you again, if you do find her
don’t expect her to
be like you expect
her to be.”
“I don’t mind what
she’s like,” Tansy
answered and went
on looking, a search
not highly organised
but insistent. It was
based more or less
on the law of aver-
ages. Many people
one didn’t know
crossed one’s path ; surely, one
day, someone one did know
and wanted to meet, would
also.
Aunt Ruby shook her head
over this, and shook it again
when she wondered what the
Moneypenny girl would think
of Tansy if they did meet.
T'vespite Aunt Ruby’s efforts,
Tansy remained countri-
fied.
She took no interest in
clothes, forgot to put on the
lipstick which had been bought
for her, never raised the cover
of a Picture Magazine, though
Aunt Ruby had every one
available delivered each week,
and was apt to break suddenly
into a monologue, which she
said was poetry, though it didn’t
sound like poetry to Aunt
Ruby, who herself was quite
fond of “Sunset and Evening
Star.” Anyhow, what Cas-
sandra Moneypenny might
think of Tansy Strathallan re-
mained to be seen and pro-
bably never would be.
At this time Aunt Ruby ad-
mitted to being 50, a conserva-
tive estimate, or else she hadn’t
worn well. Not that her piled-
high sausage curls weren’t as
gold as ever —they were golder
—and her face from chin to
forehead just as smooth and
pink and white in the right
places. But below the chin she
had moiled and sagged and
her figure overflowed abun-
dantly above and below her
corsets.
“I haven’t fallen awav f nr
which Im thankful,..
And when she settled into a
S a 'h r fa*' there ant * had ,5
be hauled out. Only the fact
that Aunt Ruby always ij
mamed placed for long periods
saved Tansy s arms from being
wrenched from their sockets,
If Tansy could be said to
have any occupation just then
it was as haulier to Aunt Ruby
•She also “went to the Village’’
which was the nearby large
suburb of Bligh Bay, several
times a day on a message for
Mrs. Siddons, who didn’t be-
lieve in keeping food in the
place as it made it untidy, and
preferred to buy half-a-pound
of butter, two sausages, a pound
of sugar or a tomato, as
required.
Also, from time to time,
Tansy washed up a few cups
and plates at home in Aunt
Ruby’s kitchen. She would have
preferred to wash all the dirty
dishes, but Aunt Ruby liked a
kitchen to look homey, and
as if it was lived-in. Cold,
tidy kitchens she didn’t like at
all. As she pointed out, the
wire screens on the windows
prevented flies from settling,
so everything was quite
hygienic.
It was Aunt Ruby’s con-
sidered opinion that a woman
needed the full day to take care
of herself. The “new” women
who went to work she couldnt
understand at all. ‘'They neg-
lect themselves,” she said, an
that’s not fair to themselves
as one never knows what wi
turn up.” . .
Tansy could only interpret
this as that Aunt Ruby, des-
pite the numerous lovers who,
on her own admission,
vanished away in her 7°^’
i- ** -s
and not very much to A
Ruby’s credit. OM W f

ips, Siddons, also, was not
I above reproach. For a
woman to talk so much

Bligh A he war y ear s hack
a y for him. She had
knitted him socks and sent him
a fruit-cake Christmas and
birthdays. True-blue Kitty,
everyone around the Bay had
called her while she waited.
She didn’t allow any man to
come within the distance of a
40ft.-pole of her.
When Joe returned already
married there was no one left
for Kitty to marry but Charlie
Sylvestor, who was hanging fire
because he was no good. Natu-
rally Kitty had to shake her fist
in Joe Siddons’s face in some
manner so she married Charlie,
who was easy as to whether he
married or not. He didn’t set
as much store on the ceremony
as Kitty did.
“I’m making my bed and I’ll
lie on it,” Kitty said on the
day of her marriage, and had
been doing so ever since. She
took in boarders to support
herself and Charlie and the
three little girls, Poor Little
Nancy, Poor Little Betty, and
Poor Little Joanie.
Oiddonses, Sylvestors and
Ruby Buckland all lived in
the same street, close to one
another as closeness went at
that time. They were neighbors,
but not friends. At least, when
Aunt Ruby was friends with
Mrs. Siddons she couldn’t
speak to Mrs. Sylvestor, and
when she was friends with Mrs.
Sylvestor she couldn’t speak to
Mrs. Siddons.
So Tansy had so far not
made Mrs. Sylvestor’s acquain-
tance. Charlie dropped in
sometimes of an afternoon to
have a glass of beer with Aunt
Ruby and Mrs. Siddons. “Can’t
help her pigheadedness,” Mrs.
Siddons said.
Charlie was pale all over,
skin and hair and pale blue
eyes. He wore crumpled silk
shirts, open at the neck, show-
ing the limp hair on his chest
and a network of blue veins,
and yellowed cricketing-pants
tied up with twine under his
outjutting hip-bones.
Tansy was willing to accept
the verdict that he was no
good and ignored him as much
as possible. He was reputed to
be a good storyteller but Tansy
saw no sense in his stories,
which didn’t stop Mrs. Siddons
and Aunt Ruby from laughing
uproariously. When Charlie
began, “Stop me if you’ve heard
this one,” Tansy closed her ears
and studied Unwisdom Bay
with renewed intensity.
When the change from Mrs.
Siddons to Mrs. Sylvestor did
come about, as indeed it must
—both Aunt Ruby and Dora
Siddons were proud of always
speaking their minds —Tansy
would not care. The thing she
liked about Siddonses was the
view from the window and
Sylvestors had the same view.
The Siddonses’ and the Syl-
vestors’ kitchens were distin-
guished by being large rooms
right across the front of the
house. How this had come
about was that they were old
houses built before the road
was made. The road had been
expected to appear in front
of what conservative people
consider to be the front of a
house. The ground was high
here, and the front entrances
were at street-level. But no!
The street had appeared at the
back, and, as the backs were
built-up and the ground fell
away, several flights of steps
gave access to it, steps which
only Tansy and Joe Siddons
used.
Aunt Ruby’s house had been
built after the road and so
faced the right way, to her satis-
faction. But this left the kit-
chen a little square box without
a view, only a buddleia tap-
ping against the wire frame
of the window to engage
Tansy’s attention.
While she admired the
buddleia, she wasn’t the kind
of girl who could remain en-
grossed in it for hours on end.
She liked broader visions. As
Aunt Ruby’s kitchen was not
used for social occasions it
didn’t matter. She couldn’t have
endured sweethearts who came
and vanished away, and broil-
ing brisket, with only the
buddleia.
The street which ran at the
backs, or the fronts, which-
ever way one preferred to see
it, of the places, was the only
one which had so far appeared
in the No-man’s land, known
locally as the Old Quarry,
which lay between Bligh Bay
and Unwisdom Bay.
From Aunt Ruby’s pergola-
surmounted front gate, a track,
overgrown at the moment,
went to the Sylvestors. Another
track, well worn, led to the Sid-
donses, and from there the
track wandered away through
lantana and blackberry bushes,
skirted the sheer stone wall of
the Old Quarry itself and
reached, in time, the well-
ordered streets of Bligh Bay.
Neither Bligh Bay Council,
nor the Main Road’s Board,
nor the P.M.G., nor any of
those places which do things,
cared anything for Unwisdom
Bay. They were careless of
Joe Siddons’s prophecy, that the
newly opened Bridge was about
to bring people from the “other
side” to settle.
“They’ll see,” said Joe Sid-
dons darkly, “and they won’t
know if their tails are their
hind pieces or their front-
pieces, it’ll come about so
sudden.”
In the meantime Aunt Ruby
said that they might as well be
in darkest Africa. She alterna-
ted this with saying that Unwis-
dom Bay reminded her of the
storied Rhine. When she looked
at the Old Quarry she mur-
mured about the Walls of
China. (A trip to Woy Woy
yearly sufficed Aunt Ruby for
travels.) Which all led Tansy
to wonder for the first time
why Australia was never like
itself.
“Sweethearts who came and
vanished away” went on
through the autumn days. Joe
Siddons came home late. Aunt
Ruby and Tansy were often
still at Siddons’s when night
fell. Tansy, leaning out the
window, watched the darkness
obliterate Unwisdom Bay and
fold-up the harbor like a carpet
to put it away till the morning
when it would unfold itself
again as she watched from her
bedroom window.
TJut Aunt Ruby was growing
-*-* restless. More frequently
she and Dora had words, and
when she and Tansy were alone
together she made deductions
about Dora Siddons.
“Joe Siddons had better
watch-out,” she said one night.
“That Dora’s no clean potato,
on her own admission.”
As Tansy felt that Aunt
Ruby’s admission scarcely
kept the potato-crop clean she
wasn’t much interested.
But she was startled several
nights later when Aunt Ruby
said: “Tell you what, I’m not
the fool she thinks I am. I’ve
got it made out, now. Dora
Siddons has got her hooks into
Charlie Sylvestor.”
“Charlie Sylvestor,” said
Tansy. “What for? Isn’t he no
good?”
“He’s not no good all ways,”
said Aunt Ruby. “Well! Well!
You wouldn’t think he’d de-
fraud Kitty twice but there it
is.”

This small but vigorous con-

DULY AND HANSFORD LIMITED
Manufacturers of Dufor Products
CHAIRMAN'S ADDRESS
The Chairman of Duly & Hansford Ltd., Mr. A. Duly, will give the following
address at the annual meeting of the Company to be held on 29th November,
1960, at the Company’s premises at Carrington Road, Marrickville.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Your Directors are pleased to
report a successful year for the
Company, with marked progress in
all sections.
Increases have been made over
last year’s results —Turnover 12£%,
Shareholders’ Funds £87,161,
Reserves £78,661, Fixed Assets
£109,266, Sundry Debtors £124,935,
Stock Manufactured and Raw
Material £166,351 —and we have
gained many new Customers.
Nett Profit for the year at
£198,364 is £6,117 above last year,
after providing for increased Depre-
ciation and Taxation totalling
£29,433.
The Directors continued the
policy of Plant replacement with
modern machines, which, to some
degree, assists in controlling the
rapidly rising costs Industry is
experiencing in Wage and Raw
Material increases. The value of
Plant additions for the year amounts
to £156,827, but as most of this
was installed in the latter half of
the year it had little bearing on the
year’s results.
The Company’s development was
influenced by the general prosperity
throughout the community. We
hold a prominent position as sup-
pliers of a wide range of com-
ponents used in the building
of motor vehicles —cars, trucks,
tractors, etc. —and also for servicing
the Road Transport Industry. We
are also closely linked with the
rapidly expanding Engineering
Industry, where we again supply a
wide range of products.
Our plans for the current year
cover a further cost of £160,000 for
new Plant and £130,000 for Build-
ings now in course of construction.
As the year progresses, other
necessary items will be included.
Our confidence in the Company’s
future is based on the great future
for Australia, with a rising popula-
tion creating an increased demand
for the products of Australian
Industry. We are located close
to the City and have valuable
land available for further expan-
sion. We have 1,200 Shareholders
on the Share Register and provide
employment for over 900 people.
Prospects for the current year are
promising, as for the 4 months
July to October, Turnover shows
an increase of 22% over the similar
period of last year.
To assist in financing our plans
for the current year’s development,
we made a new capital issue in
July to Shareholders, of one new
share for every four shares held by
them, at par, amounting to £327,148.
A review of the principal items
in the Accounts is now presented
for your information.
NETT PROFIT.
The Trading Profit- for the year
is £339,864 against that for last
year £315,247, the increase being
£24,617. The amount charged for
Depreciation is £100,370 against
last year’s total of £89,437. Pro-
vision for Taxation has been
increased by £18,500 to £141,500.
From the remaining Nett Profit of
£198,364 the Directors recommend
the payment of a Final Dividend
at the rate of 10% per annum,
amounting to £65,430, which, with
the Interim Dividend paid in July,
makes a Total Dividend of £130,859.
The remaining Profit of £67,505
will be added to the Accumulated
Profits, making the total amount
carried forward £379,688.
RESERVES.
The total Reserves shown in the
Balance Sheet amount to £829,187,
after giving effect to appropriations
recommended by the Directors, and,
with the exception of Unappro-
priated Profits, have not been drawn
upon during the year.
SHAREHOLDERS’ FUNDS.
The Shareholders’ Funds now
total £2,146,281, an increase of
£87,161 for the year.
LAND AND BUILDINGS.
The total value of the Company’s
Property is £441,814, the increase
for the year amounting to £42,304.
During the year we have acquired
land adjacent to our existing hold-
ings and this has been a valuable
acquisition for future expansion.
PLANT AND MACHINERY.
£675,803 (last year £621,176) after
making provision for Depreciation
of the whole Plant, the Balance
Sheet discloses a nett increase of
£54,627, but the gross Capital Cost
of new Plant installed during the
year is £156,827.
OFFICE FURNITURE AND
EQUIPMENT.
The value of this item is £42,425
(last year £33,282).
SUNDRY DEBTORS AND BILLS
RECEIVABLE.
£354,569 (last year £229,634). The
total amount owing by Customers
is £354,569, an increase of £124,935
for the year. All accounts are in
excellent order.
STOCK INVENTORY.
£1,369,635 (last year £1,203,284).
The increase for the year is
£166,351 and is considered to be
good holding in view of the acute
shortage of Steel supplies.
DEPRECIATION.
£100,370 (last year £89,437). All
Plant and Machinery has been
maintained in first-class condition
throughout the year. Adequate
provision for Depreciation over the
whole Plant has been made and the
increase for the year is £10,933.
TAXATION.
£141,500 (last year £123,000).
The amount provided for taxation
is based on the increased rates in
the recent Federal Budget.
On behalf of the Directors, I
would now like to extend our
appreciation to the members of the
Staff for their loyal service through-
out the year.
To all the Company’s Customers
we express our thanks for their
continued support.
A. DULY,
Chairman of Directors.

*t| n ?t only our own
k,S“f s wi * their
CK of experience in
oil-finding who appear in this
category. Even among the in-
ternational companies we find
searching going on in areas
with no known source-rocks
available.
There is no doubt that one
can always say that not enough
evidence is in hand to rule out
these areas. Yet one wonders
if all the evidence which is
available has been utilised as
an indicator of the probabilities
of finding or not finding the
suitable source- and reservoir-
rocks.
It takes tremendous financial
and technical resources to ex-
plore an area, and it would
seem a far better exercise to
buy into an area with reason-
able possibilities for a share
of potential production rather
than to search in areas of poor
to invisible prospects merely
because the area is available.
Since source- and reservoir-
rocks, and especially source-
rocks, appear all-important in
Australia, one wonders why
seismic surveys are being
singled out in importance as a
method for oil-search.
Seismic surveys become
necessary only where the deeper
rocks are masked by surficia.l
deposits or by younger rocks
having different dips. Such
surveys can do no more than
determine the structural atti-
tudes of the buried strata.
The fact that a company
puts a seismic crew into an
area does not automatically
make the area prospective for
oil. The presence of the seismic
crew merely recognises the fact
that there is no cheaper way
to determine the deeper struc-
ture.
Until the first deep hole is
drilled, one cannot know
whether the area does, in fact,
contain the marine rocks which
almost universally reflect the
environment necessary for
hydrocarbon production and
preservation. It seems a little
unfair to shareholders for
directors to announce that the
company’s permits are being
upgraded because seismic work
has found structures when
nothing has been done to
evaluate the nature of the
rocks. The rocks, after all, are
the vessel in which the oil will
be found.
It may well be proved that
good oil prospects exist in areas
in Australia where surface geo-
logical mapping can provide all
the answers concerning the
nature of the rocks as well as
their structure. Of course, the
oil-exploration business is a
little like horseracing—each has
his own ideas on how to run
the race. Still, until it has been
demonstrated that a permit has
a sufficient thickness of marine
rocks, there is no basis for un-
reasoning optimism.
This author has been asked
many times if he thinks there
is oil in Australia. For what
it is worth, the answer is “yes.”
Remove the fanfare and the
hopeful utterances and one
still finds that the truly prospec-
tive areas of the country are
all under permit and are receiv-
ing attention in various degrees.
Sooner or later a hole will be
drilled in the right location and
oil or gas will come up in the
continuing flow which will
mark the first commercial dis-
covery. This discovery will
lead to others in the same
general area. Whether the
strikes will be large enough
to affect Australia’s economy
in a strongly positive fashion
is a question which must be
left to another occasion.


and sore-backed mules before
our job had really started.
1 think what made him ignore
the tale was that it was getting
very late in the season for wild
grapes to be pick able.
I might say here that some
time later I checked-up with an
old Wyndhamonian and
learned that 12 or 13 years
before two men had left town
in a whaleboat to prospect and
beachcomb around the Gulf.
They were never heard of
again.
Granny was probably telling
the truth. The time-lag wouldn’t
mean a thing to her.
TVText day we were moving;
the biggest party I have
ever seen in the bush.
Gordon and a lad from the
Mission named Harry Smith
took the lead, with a few
mounted half-caste and black
stockmen, and Bungi and his
party on foot. Then the hunters,
so necessary in a beefless coun-
try —all armed with Winches-
ters and, as good hunters should
be, also on foot. Myself and
the rest of the team would
pack-up and follow after.
The gentle Bungi couldn’t
realise that a path up which
he could stalk without drawing
breath might not be so easily
negotiable for a man with a
horse under him or a mule with
3001 b. on top of it. I became
expert at halting at the foot
of a cliff, changing the pack-
breechings into breastplates to
keep the loads from sliding
over the mules’ rumps on the
climb ; then, perched on un-
inhabited eagles’-nests, chang-
ing the gear back into breech-
ings to keep the packs from
sliding over their ears on the
way down.
We kept going—north and
west. No lunch-time halts;
just a long, wearying stage of
from 10 to 13 hours, depend-
ing on the water. Our maps
were incomplete and not very
accurate.
Through the ranges and
rivers the desolation was over-
powering, the loneliness de-
moralising ; but whenever I
thought that we must be
beyond where any white had
penetrated I’d see a heap of
rusty tins or an old squareface
gin-bottle.
On about the sixth day we
hit the King George or the
Berkeley River —I don’t know
which, even now. We could
hear the roar of the surf to the
northward. In front of us was
a plateau of jagged ironstone
boulders. Even Bungi, through
the interpreter, doubted
whether we could get the pack-
mules any farther.
This, then, would be our
depot camp. Gordon and the
main body—a few mounted,
but most on foot —left im-
mediately after a feed, to
locate the beach and search
for tracks. I got stuck into
the flour-bag. I had three
camp-ovens full of dough, and
had just decided to shave and
bathe while they were cooking
when two boys with mules, and
“I 've always Wanted a nice , friendly neighbor.”
news, arrived. Our men were
alive, but very weak.
Bush blacks had found them
on the beach and sent word to
Drysdale Mission. The priests
had started-off their best two
blackboys and their only two
mules to pick up the castaways
and take them on to Forrest
River. When these boys cut
our tracks they had enough
sense to come after us.
T could have sent messengers
after Gordon—they prob-
ably would have missed him.
I could have taken the new
arrivals as guides, and earned
the somewhat empty honor of
being the first white - man
rescuer.
What I actually did was to
follow the old bush proverb:
“When in doubt bake another
damper.”
Just as well I did, because
when Gordon got back at dark
he decided to move off as soon
as the moon rose. He travelled
light, taking nothing but food
and medicines with him. I
followed in the morning with
the plant.
Two hours out from camp we
discovered that Gordon’s dog
was missing. As the dog had
been left in my charge, and,
moreover, would never follow a
blackboy or even a half-caste,
I had to turn back.
I picked him up about mid-
day, trotting back along our
previous day’s tracks. Not
wishing to be caught in the
dark in country I didn’t know
I tried a short-cut and got
tangled -up in some ridgy
country where even the walla-
bies really needed alpenstocks.
I lost valuable time chasing
myself and the dog around in
half-circles.
When I caught the plant it
was bailed-up at a creek-cross-
ing—a hundred yards of flat,
slippery granite, which the
pack-mules wouldn’t face. By
adopting tough methods we got
them all over bar one. In-its
case we unpacked and carried
the gear over ourselves.
The mule, after the fashion
of its kind, followed us without
further urging.

ever, the men had been weeks
without razors or even soap
Footwal.k blackfellows were
already on the way to Forrest
Mission to get the pilot-launch
out from Wyndham. Gordon
Harry Smith and a small party
would await its arrival. I was
to start back next day with the
plant.
This suited me. As there
was no six-months’ job looking
for corpses, the sooner 1 got
my own horses out of the only
bit of Australia that I didn't
reckon was worth fighting for
the better I’d be pleased.
Even dog-poisoning was out,
Though there were hundreds of
dingoes in the area there were
almost as many half-tamed
dogs in the blacks’ camp. As
this tribe had done the right
thing by the airmen it would
have been a poor return to
have laid-out baits that their
dogs might pick up.
I spent the night sorting the
few things I would need for
the return journey and making-
up —under Gordon’s instruc-
tions — a nobly adequate
reward for Bungi and his team.
So far we had held them in
a sort of protective custody.
Now they were released, and
told to report in the morning
for their handout. They cor-
roboreed with our blacks unti
moonrise, and then left with-
out their pay-off.
Funny people, the blacks.

A White Settler Gives His Views
New Guinea--A Seventh State?
By K. A. SAXBY
New Guinea would present few'
problems to Australia if it were
1000 miles north of Cape York
instead of only 100. If only New
Guinea were far enough away, as Ghana
and Nigeria are from England, it would
be easy enough to follow the fashionable
course. Rush-up scores of schools and
training-colleges, and maybe a university
while we are at it; hastily create a tiny
half - baked elite, and at earliest—“not
more than 10 years”—hand over the
whole country to them lock, stock, and
barrel. Then depart, with much official
self-congratulation and back-patting. No
worry or concern at the possibility that
the new “nation” would speedily fall
apart into chaos, to be taken-over or
propped-up by an expensive U.N. outfit
or some Asiatic power until it hap-
pened! Out of sight, out of mind.
Other solutions? Gradual indepen-
dence is out, too, now. The idea of
slowly but steadily bringing the whole
mass of the people, instead of merely an
“elite,” towards self-government, was
sound, but there simply is not the time
any more. The world won’t give us
time, even if the natives would. In any
case, independence later-would still give
no guarantee of a well-disposed New
Guinea.
Then there’s the idea of the Territory
as a self-governing unit, within the Aus-
tralian orbit, but carefully outside the
Australian political system. Papua-New
Guinea would run itself as a self-con-
tained, self-governing entity under Aus-
tralian defence and foreign-policy control.
This ingenious arrangement would not
be long-lived. Having got three-quarters
of the cake, the Papua-New Guineans
would speedily demand the rest. They
wouldn’t for long put up with being
inferior citizens, with being under the
Australian flag and still having the White
Australia policy applied against them.
The Only Way
'T'his leaves one alternative—to start a
programme for the preparation of
Papua-New Guinea for eventual admis-
sion as a full-fledged Australian State,
and to tell the Territory people so, now.
This approach bristles with difficulties.
But we would have to be quick. A
political vacuum is already developing
in the Territories, and the crazy Africa-
type of berserk black nationalism will
fill it soon enough if we don’t get in first.
There would of course be violent
reaction from the Afro-Asian bloc. The
wolf-cry against annexation would be
loud and long. W'e shouldn’t let this
bother us too much. After all, Papua
is, and has been for more than 50 years,
an integral part of Australia. The Trust
Territory of New Guinea was annexed
de facto after the war when its adminis-
tration was officially merged with
Papua’s. Full incorporation into the Aus-
tralian Commonwealth is a logical and
relatively small next step. If its avowed
objective is the advancement and train-
ing of the native people for full Austra-
lian citizenship as citizens of an Austra-
lian State, on equal footing with the six
mainland States and with all attendant
rights, this should satisfy the U.N.
Difficulties to Face
'T'he road to Statehood, as to indepen-
■*- dence, would be a long and rocky one.
There is the same colossal job to be done
in education, health and hygiene, and
economic development. It will be a long
time before education up there becomes
universal. On the score of public health,
the three chief killers of the native
people are malnutrition, malaria, and
pulmonary diseases, and all of these are
still general in spite of the excellent
headway made. In spite of remarkable
progress with cocoa and coffee in the
last few years, Papua-New Guinea is still
largely an undeveloped country and can
only provide about a third of its rela-
tively small budget. The deficit, amount-
ing at present to around £l4 million a
year, is made good by the Australian
taxpayer. It has been increasing steadily
and will continue to do so, whatever
happens, as more and more money is
needed for the Territory’s services. The
country will not be able to finance itself
for many years, and reassurance as to
the future is needed if there is to be the
necessary capital investment to bring
greatly increased productivity. A declara-
tion of future Statehood would give rise
to confidence. The many millions needed
for Papua-New Guinea development will
be readily forthcoming if it is to remain
in the family, but it is a different matter
if it is to go down the drain to what
might well become a tenth-rate Commu-
nist-dominated coconut-republic.
A policy of Statehood is that it would
give us more time to do a better job.
We could concentrate on the task of
teaching the natives to regard themselves
as Australians instead of as foreigners.
This would not probably be as difficult
as some commentators think ; many
natives would like to call themselves
Australians now. It would take maybe
20-30 years to get enough of them, and
their country, to the stage, where they
could take over, qualified for admission
as a State. It is reasonable to suppose
that any future State Governments would
be predominantly black, but the impor-
tant thing is that the black legislators
would be Australian citizens, with an
Australian outlook. If this were so, lives,
rights, and property of racial minorities
would be just as assuredly safe and taken
for granted as they are on the Austr?
lian mainland. ' a "
Although such a mammoth job would
have to be done to get the Panua-New
Guinea people educated to Statehood a
considerable section of the Australian
public would also have to be educated
to accept it, the very section, strangely
enough, that pays the most vociferous
lip-service to the ideal of racial equality
—that is, the Labor party and the trade-
unions. It would be necessary to con-
vince these people that there need be
no threat involved to their jobs or their
way of iife —no “little Harlems” of cheap
black labor in the Australian cities. A
Papua-New Guinean, after Statehood,
would in Australia work under the same
awards and conditions, and be a member
of the same union, as a New South
Welshman or Victorian in a similar job.
In any case, there’s no indication that
the black Australians would want to flood
south. There may be malnutrition in
New Guinea, but thebe’s no hunger,
When a native gets tired of his job he
as a rule drifts back to his village, where
he has his land and his fishing grounds.
The growing number of detribalised
natives in Moresby and Rabaul could
be a problem—it is one that will have
to be tackled in any event —but immigra-
tion into mainland Australia could be
controlled by a permit-system, just as
immigration into Papua-New Guinea is
controlled now. Papua - New Guineans
wouldn’t want a squalid community of
poor blacks in Australia any more than
we want one of poor whites in New
Guinea.
No Alternative
The main argument for Statehood to
Papua-New Guinea is that there is
so little to put into its place. Not even
the crustiest old-timer or loudest-moutneo
newchum any longer pretends it wou
be possible to hold the nat ‘ v f o .^ vn an! ,|
long, as at present, without a e^ n 1
in sight. Independence is simpy 1
patible with Australia’s own
whether it is “guaranteed by
offering Australian citizenship
to New Guinea’s Chinese. I jn g
it also immediately to al
mixed-bloods and to nat,v f’ stan dar d
qualify. We mustn’t lower educa t e
of citizenship for them, we a
them up to it. Dr. Reuben ’an
native leader, says he is p ffet tjng
Australian. Let’s .concentrate o
the majority of hl *. c ® u ” f r ! henl as wW
that way. Let’s think of Whi te
they are, our own P e °P e - j t - s for
Australia policy is not for
outsiders only.

few punters who laid such ex-
travagant odds-on had no wor-
ries. With Williamson sitting
quietly, the bay colt coasted
home five lengths clear.
A 2600gns. buy at the Adelaide
yearling-sales, Cotillion is unlikely
to be anything but a sprinter. He
is by Coronation Boy (imp.) from

who would now be asked to con-
cede a lot of weight to the other
Victorian youngsters in handicaps.
Bill Williamson, riding better
than ever since his European

who carried top weight against
the other three-year-old colts
and geldings in the six-furlongs
Warrigal Handicap —last race
on the programme, by when the
track was as slippery as a
greased pole. Skadar almost
lost his footing on the home-
turn, but recovered well to race
home an easy winner.
As a two-year-old Skadar was
one of Melbourne’s best, brut his
recent form had been only moder-
ate. He is now in Kel Chapman’s
hands, after passing through a
couple of other stables.
Very few of the big New

took Lord Sasanof quite a

the weak Heatherton Welter
on Saturday, where the com-
pany was a good deal less
select than he had been mixing
with. He was due to return
home this week, but his win
may encourage his connections
to give him his chance in the
Eclipse Stakes.

The Coronation Boy filly
Lady Seymour, who scored two
runaway wins in Adelaide, has
not had much luck on her Mel-
bourne visit. At Flemington last
Saturday week she ran second
to a very good filly in Miss
Wonderbox, in the Ottawa
Stakes, and in the Clarinda
Stakes at Caulfield on Satur-
day she put up a first-class
effort to again run second, this
time to Girletta. The merit of
Lady Seymour’s run was that
she missed the start by half-a-
dozen lengths.
Punters who laid odds-on Lady
Seymour in the Clarinda were not
made any happier by the thought
that Girletta had started favorite
in the Ottawa Stakes, only to finish
with the whippers-in. Girletta,
New Zealand-bred, is by Alpen-
hom from Sally O. She cost only
400gns.
Next " Saturday’s £3OOO
Eclipse Stakes is the last of the
big spring handicaps. It is
usually regarded as a consola-
tion prize for horses that have
missed in the Cups, and was,
in fact; formerly known as the
Consolation Stakes. If the
muddy conditions continue, St.
Pierre might win the Eclipse,
with Nilarco and Gold Rebel
his chief dangers.
Though George Moore
“cracked it” on Cruiser in the
Batman Stakes at Flemington,
it’s remarkable how very
seldom during an internation-
ally successful career George
has ridden winners in Mel-
bourne. After many attempts,
he at last did the trick on Play-
boy as long as 12 years ago,
only to lose on a protest and,
despite regular visits, neither
his luck nor average down there
has improved much since. As
a strange parallel to this, Jack
Purtell’s several visits to Syd-
ney in the same period have
failed to yield him so much as
one winner! —“P.0.M.C.”

a bright 50-odd in a little more
than an hour.
Having to chase a score of
6-544 (dec.) is not an enviable
task for Queensland. At time
of writing they had lost 3-130,
which included the wickets of
Mackay and Burge. First-
innings defeat seemed inevit-
able, though an outright defeat
could well be staved-off by the
second-innings efforts of the
Test hopes. As matters stand,
Grout is the only Queenslander
certain of a Test place.
As stated here a few weeks
ago, the West Indians will be
turning on plenty of bright,
attractive cricket on their
current tour; they certainly
played it in the Perth game
against a Combined XI.
Of the bowlers, the star of
the match was undoubtedly
Indies’ pace-man Wesley Hall,
whom Harvey rated the fastest
bowler in the world today, but
the batsmen did their whack,
too.
Skipper Worrell (65 and 68,
both not-out), Kanhai (103 and
54), Sobers (a brilliant second-
innings 72) and ’keeper Alex-
ander, with a hard-hitting 58
in his second knock, showed-
out for the visitors.
Only two Combined XI
batsmen really got going, but
Harvey (80 and 63) and Mc-
Donald (a second-innings 104),
showed that Hall was only
human.
The West Indians’ fielding was
not up to performances in the other
departments, and dropped catches
undoubtedly cost them the game.
Both Misson and Quick, whose
dogged ninth-wicket stand averted
defeat, were dropped, but Worrell
has already indicated that he will
be trying to remedy the bad field-
ing and, come the Tests, there
probably won’t be many second
chances given.
Victoria thrashed S.A. by nine
wickets in the first Sheffield Shield
match of the season, played at
Adelaide. Nearly all the Victorian
batsmen got amongst the runs, but
the S.A. bats collapsed in the first
innings, when Meckiff bowled
dangerously to take 3-29. Test
batsman Les Favell failed again in
the second knock.
In a high-scoring match in
Sydney, N.S.W. Colts beat Queens-
land Colts by 43 runs on the first
innings. Main item was 18-year-old
opener Peter Kelly’s record 204
for N.S.W. Also, Russ Waugh,
considered mainly a spin-bowler,
made 124. Queensland was handi-
capped by an injury to University
fast-bowler Tom Stewart, spoken
of in Brisbane as a likely Sheffield
rep.
First five Victorian bats-
men to come to the crease
in the Victoria v. South Aus-
tralia shield game at Adelaide
were lefthanders. Anyone know
if this is a moliydookers’ record
in first-class games in Aus-
tralia? —“Vic.”

Exit "King Richard"
Victorian Football League
club Essendon has dropped the
biggest bombshell for years in
appointing former champion
goal-kicker John Coleman as
coach in place of Dick
Reynolds, who has held the
position for the past 22 years
and was considered a cer-
tainty to again coach the
Bombers next season
It brings to an end the
career of one of the Aussie
Rules code’s greatest players.
“King Richard” Reynolds
started off with Essendon in
1933 as a 17-year-old, The
following year he won our
football’s greatest award, the
Brownlow Medal. He won it
again in seasons 1937 and
1938. In 1939 he was elected
coach of the club and had held
that job ever since. In this
period the Bombers finished
out of the “four” on only six
occasions, won four premier-
ships and were runners-up
seven times.
All in all, “King Richard”
played 320 League games ; a
record that might never be
beaten. He received a testi-
monial of £2o7B—claimed to
be the highest amount of cash
ever given to an Australian
footballer. He had a grand-
stand named in his honor, and
he led several Victorian State
sides.
His successor, John Cole-
man, started with Essendon in
1949 and in his first match
kicked 12 goals. He finished
the season with exactly 100 —
the only player ever to kick a
century in his first season. His
career continued in this spec-
tacular vein until a serious
knee injury in a match
against North Melbourne in
1954 forced him to retire when
he was at his peak. He had
played 99 games and booted
537 goals.

ADDITIONS
ALGERIA —DE GAULLE'S BIG PROBLEM
■p ecalling that it was Algeria
that brought General de
Gaulle back into power two-
and-a-half years ago and that
it is Algeria that has made his
tenure of office more uncom-
fortable and less productive
than it should have been, the
“Yorkshire Post” remarks that
it seems likely that in the next
few weeks Algeria will either
buttress that power or break
it for ever:
“The President has, in fact,
had several contrary policies
to end the civil war and general
economic disruption that has
wracked France’s North Afri-
can possession so long. He
has ranged from endorsement,
rather unwilling, of the ‘inte-
gration’ of Algeria to the
search for an Algerian ‘Third
Force,’ from the self-deter-
mination offer last year to his
‘military victory first’ slogan
early this year. At present he
has returned to self-determina-
tion, by which he now seems
to mean leaving the inhabitants
of Algeria to decide their own
future by ‘peaceful’ vote.
“How peaceful such voting
would be is doubtful. But if
the President appealed for
calm, asserted pacifying mea-
sures and at the same time
announced a firm date for vot-
ing it would probably be the
least dangerous of the choice
of moves, all dangerous, that
are open to him. It is probably
what the mass of French citi-
zens, who remember too well
both Dien-Bien-Phu and Suez,
would prefer.
“But this is leaving aside not
only the tribe of French poli-
ticians but the armed forces—
still insecurely under govern-
mental control —and the Lett-
ish factions in North Africa
itself, only too happy to make
trouble in return for whatever
—Paris “Le Canard Enchatne."
ALL FOR ALGERIA.
cossetting there may be from
the U.S.S.R. Constitutionally
speaking, the President has dic-
tatorial powers. His rule has
been described as not demo-
cratic, not republican and not
monarchist but ‘Mon Archie.’
He should be able to brook no
nonsense and get what he re-
quires done, done. This, it has
however become clear, is not
in the nature of the President.
He is a ‘Great Man’; he dreams
dreams, as many dictators have
done —‘intuitions’ Hitler called
his —but his dreams have had
a liberal hue. He has not,
though he could have, taken
away the semblances of free-
dom (it is still possible to buy
extreme Left and pro-Fascist
journals freely); and he has
not crushed the expression of
opinion, though he has largely
removed it from the Parlia-
mentary sphere by running
Government largely by techno-
crats and bureaucrats.
“A despot may in the course
of time allow himself the
luxury of benevolence, as Sala-
zar has perhaps done. But he
will make a poor showing if
he starts by being benevolent
in conditions such as obtain
in France where there is a
militant Right, with dema-
gogues like Poujade and
generals dubiously loyal to the
regime, alongside a strident
deeply entangled abroad.
It does seem that, since the
President has vast powers
under his Constitution, he had
better use them to settle his
Algerian problem. If you are
a dictator, you must dictate —
or abdicate.”
The Manchester “Guard-
ian,” viewing conditions in
France and the dilemma fac-
ing de Gaulle in Algeria, is
reminded of the magic broom-
sticks in “The Sorcerer’s
Apprentice,” with their
bucketsful of water, and won-
ders whether the magician will
be able to break the spell be-
fore the “mounting tide of
assorted discontents” bursts
the whole house asunder:
“President de Gaulle has
shown the Assembly pretty
sharply on his tour of Southern
France that he is still master
and still confident of getting
the French people, if need be,
to underwrite this mastery
against all comers. The coun-
try, he says, has entrusted him

rumored to be conspiring witS
Right-wing extremists. But he
does nothing to lessen a soli-
tude which may with time sap
away his power or, if he should
d.e first, leave France leader-
less.
“One can analyse in detail
the motives that make French-
men—and French politicians
—oppose or support the Presi-
dent’s policy towards Nato, his
Algerian policy, or his Euro-
pean policy. On all these
matters, even on Algeria, there
is now beginning to be a pub- ■
lie opinion more wide-awake
than in the past few years. But
it is all to little avail while the
President declines to enter upon
the give-and-take that cons 1-
tutes political life.

and those who support him on

believes that
if all those now resident in
Algeria, with the exception of
the armed rebels, are given a
free choice, they will vote for
the kind of ‘Algerian Algeria’
closely linked with metropoli-
tan France.
“This conviction may be a
gamble or it may be intuition
based on close examination of
Algerian minds and motives.
Certainly the failure of the
recent talks with the F.L.N. has
not changed either his policy
or his optimism. So far as
Algeria is concerned, timing
is important, and one mighf
well ask whether the President’s
patience is likely to succeed, or
whether forces beyond his con-
trol will soon turn Algeria into
a new Korea. That may depend
on the Kremlin and on Peking,
but if these two malignant
centres, as interpreted by M.
Ferhat Abbas, are prepared to
give greater support to the
F.L.N. than they gave last year,
then time may not be on the
President’s side. Unequivocal
French support for him now
might readjust the balance.”
Train of Mysteries
TPhe shortening of the Orient
Express’s run, making
Vienna the last stop instead of
Bucharest as of old, is un-
likely to affect many passen-
gers ; indeed, official reports
have it that there were some-
times no passengers at all for
the last lap under the Iron
Curtain. But, asks the Buffalo
(U.S.) “Evening News,” what
are the thriller-writers going to
use for a mystery train?
“They’re the ones who are


bound to suffer from the change
in their favorite scene. On
what intrigue-packed line did
E. Phillips Oppenheim speed
more spies and diplomats? On
what train did Alfred Hitch-
cock make ladies vanish after
smudging signs on steamed
panes? Where else could
Agatha Christie pack 10 sus-
pects into a single wagon-lit?
Where will the thrillers find
another line transient of so
many borders, so many minor
capitals, replete with so many
changing uniforms, French
and German, Magyar and Slav?
“Romance clung even to the
dirty windows of third-class
carriages. It rubbed off No
Smoking signs in three tongues.
The poor couple opposite com-
plete with lunch-basket and
wine? Who knows, it might
be the disguise of the pretender
(and his wife) to the throne of
Transylvania.
“Three times a week at 10,
the Orient Express pulled out
of the Gare de l’Est, and the
shiny sides of the wagons-lit,
amid the anticipatory steam
dissipating in the grey drizzle
of a Paris night, were packed
with the romance of smuggled
diamonds, concealed guns,
svelte and sinister blondes.. It
sped at night through France
and over the Rhine and then—
the thrillers forgot—collapsed
into a glamorless chugging
local.
“But grubbiness of fact was
always transformed by fictional
fame: Somehow Europe and
the East and a history
were all wrapped up in that
train.”

pressed doubts as to the wis-
dom of long-drawn-out politi-
cal campaigns and suggested
that it might be to the benefit
of the country to find some
way of shortening them. Com-
menting on this, Manchester
“Guardian” points out that in
West Germany the parties
have already began campaign-
ing for the Bundestag election,
although polling-day is nearly a
year away :
“The Social Democrats have
presented Herr Brandt as their
candidate for the Chancellor-
ship, and Dr. Adenauer has

secure a fourth term in office,
Like the two American candi-
dates, the two German rivals
find themselves fairly close to-
gether in many of their policies,
Mr. Khrushchev has been the
chief architect of this new
harmony.
“It is true that, on domestic
issues, the unequalled pros-
perity of the Federal Republic,
the rising standards of living
and of welfare, have deprived
the political parties of conflicts
over principles and confined
them to arguments over
matters of detail. But Russia’s

He cited the work done by
molecular biologists and said
that this was work in which
Britain led the world. “We are

Cockcroft also referred to
the need for international co-
operation to meet the expense
of scientific development.
Britain was co-operating with
11 other European nations in
the development of advanced
experimental atomic - reactors.
Similar collaboration seemed
desirable for other large-scale
projects such as a future radio-
telescope which might cost ten
times as much as Jodrell Bank,
or for a large optical telescope
for the Southern Hemisphere.
Dragnet Digest
Don Cook, in New York
“Herald Tribune”: “Outside the
Continent, with its old power
positions in the world all but
vanished and its nuclear
strength less and less of a
reality, Britain can slip into
the state of a frustrated, em-
bittered, unhappy junior part-
ner to an American Admini-
stration remote in Washington
and seemingly out of touch.
But if it can find its feet—
indeed, much greater than that,
find an entirely new role for
itself in the scheme of things,
in its relations' with Europe—
then Anglo-American relations
as well will take on new vitality
and new meaning.
“The incoming American
Administration could do no
better than make a solution
of the problem of Britain and
Europe one of its main
priorities. Certainly the British
deserve more help from Wash-
ington than they have gotten.
But in the process, Britain is
going to have to give up some
of the special American rela-
tionship in which it takes par-
ticular pride and work harder
at the creation of a Continental
relationship which the whole
alliance so badly needs. The
process will be neither quick
nor easy for either London or
Washington.”

Denis Warner, in “The
Reporter” (U.S.): “To Chiang
. . . the strength he has created
on Quemoy is essential not for
the defence of Formosa but
for the defence of his political
creed To Mao, who is no
more willing than Chiang to see
any further steps towards ‘two
Chinas,’ any embarrassment
caused by the minor provoca-
tions of the Nationalists on
Quemoy is more than compen-
sated for by the unique oppor-
tunities the island affords in
the pursuit of his major objec-
tive to drive the United States
out of the western Pacific. In
the furtherance of this cam-
paign, Japan, not Formosa, is
the immediate target. In this
context a Quemoy ever grow-
ing stronger provides an almost
unlimited . field for exploita-
tion.”

SiIONDS Solicitors,
Itreet, Sydney.-C. a
Registrar.
Some of the half-caste lads
who had neither my imagina-
tion nor the full-bloods’ fear
of lunacy were brought on
strength as guardians, and
Gordon assigned me to another
job. Whenever Adolf started
raving, Bertram would also
show signs of emotional upset.
He would come to me: “Talk
to me, Tom! Please! Talk to
me!”
After a lifetime of being
told that I talked too much,
this was something of a turn-
up. But to be awakened some-
times about two-o’clock . . .
to sit shivering on a rock and
against the background-music
of a howling wind and Klaus-
man’s delirious shouting . . .
to translate the idiom of pearl-
ing-fleet and cattle-camp into
precise foreigner’s English well
enough to hold Bertram’s in-
terest —perhaps his sanity . . .
It was probably the greatest
bit of yarn - spinning with
tongue or typewriter that I am
likely ever to achieve.
HThen, poor Klausman, in one
■*- of his mad fits:
“Captain Marshall! Captain
Marshall! I wish to report
Smith. Speaking against the
Government ...”
Now, this was back in
’thirty-two, when Hitler was
still only a bad joke around
the Munich beer-halls, and
Germany was, supposedly, a
Democratic Republic. I think
we felt glad to be natives' of
a country where speaking
against the Government ranks
as about the second most-
popular pastime.
Both our guests were puzzled
at our set-up. That an officer
should be on first-name terms
with the cook astounded them ;
that a white man should do
the cooking while there were
20 or more colored men in
the party shocked them.
Klausman, in his sane moods,
would ask about these things.
Hans did not. He treated
Gordon .as fellow-officer and
gentleman ; Harry Smith with
the slight condescension I’ve
seen some of our own officers
hand-out to Army padres. I
was the cook, and apparently
a menial. I was treated as
such.
If Gordon hadn’t been so
tactful and the launch hadn't
arrived I think Captain Bertram
and I might have had a falling-
out. But he farewelled me
most effusively, and told me all
the things that he and Junkers
“Just been telling the old beggar off."
were going to do for me. I did
not expect anything—and I got
what I expected.
T left one of my old mokes
knocked-up and starved on
the way back, and went broke
hanging around Wyndham
waiting for the other two to
pick-up a bit of condition.
Bertram was down south
enjoying more publicity than
any flyer in our history bar
Amy Johnson. Poor Adolf,
held in Wyndham, seemed to
be on the mend. I believe he
cracked-up again after he was
taken away.
A couple of years later, at
the end of the longest and
toughest starve I ever enjoyed,
I happened to be one of eight
casuals waiting for a pick-up
outside the Wyndham goods-
sheds.
Roy Goad, the policeman,
came along, saw who was
present, and called out, “Hey,
the Sergeant wants you!”
Five of our party got to their
feet.
“No,” said Roy, “none of
you blokes. Tom Ronan.”
“Don’t go! ” muttered one of
the group. “Make him arrest
you, and don’t make a state-
ment unless they warn you
first.”
I wandered down to the
station in innocent bewilder-
ment. There was a package
there for me containing a
beautiful enamel cross with a
red border and a brass eagle
and red-and-white ribbon.
There was also a certificate
to the effect that Hindenberg
Beckendorf and the Prince of
Saxe Coburg and Gotha had
ganged-up to award me the
' I*
First Class Order of the Ger-!
man Red Cross. Gordon had,!: 1
of course, got one; so hal
Sutcliffe and Captain Crane!
skipper of the launch which
located the flying-boat and]
later brought the party in. Old
Sergeant Flinders and myself
also drew the award.
Although I have never worn
the cross it has always been
somewhere in my gear when-
ever I happened to be. In fact,
one night in October,’42, when
I missed the Boomerang Track
turn-off and plugged along in
the dark past Tel El Eisa rail-!
way-station, it narrowly missed 1
going back to Germany—and
taking me with it.

THE OTHER FELLOW'S MIMD
Four-letters Let Loose
I’m not very interested in
reading about what Lady Chat-
terley said to her Lover, or
what the author said about
both of them ; the release of
the book, in all its raw naked-
ness, inspires me only with a
vague curiosity as to how D.
H. Lawrence managed his
famous “four-letter words.”
Or mismanaged them. I have
a suspicion that he would have
bungled the job.
His attitude in the matter
has been more or less defined.
“Don’t be afraid of the so-
called obscene words,” he
wrote. “There is nothing
wrong with the words. It is
your fear that makes them
bad . . . Restore the so-called
obscene words, which are part
of the natural flow.” Here
Lawrence exposes himself as
startlingly innocent; clearly he
knows little of the idiom of
cursing. He has not realised
what is the true utilitarian
function of these words, nor
does he appreciate that their
real significance is grafted into
the vernacular as unalterably
as an arm or a leg.
That Lawrence, for all his
literary sophistication, should
possess such a blind-spot is not
so odd. He led a sheltered
life. He started as a “mother’s
boy,” developed into a
“teacher’s pet” who kept aloof
from other children, and passed
all his adult days in bookish
circles, well clear of the hurly-
burly of coarse and vulgar
types who are the great ex-
ponents of lofty vituperation.
Obviously he had never over-
heard a quarrel between
drunken low-lifers.
The fact is that, in general
use, the main four-letter words
are practically never given their
ostensible meanings; in the
ordinary speech of our day
and his they are simply swear-
words used sometimes for
masculine emphasis, but re-
served almost exclusively for
abuse; they are fired-out in
the heat of anger, hatred or
contempt. This is because,
separately or in combination,
they form the most damaging
and filthy epithets known to
90 per cent, of the population.
Besides, the words are inter-
changeable, easy to pronounce,
and can be fitted-in anywhere
even in the middle of another
word. I once heard a two-
“HE'S a sucker!”
syllable swear sandwiched into
the word “edjer-cashun” with
impressive effect. They are
most adaptable—with or with-
out suffixes, they can be used
as nouns, verbs, participles,
adjectives or any other parts of
speech. Any bird-watcher in-
terested in the technique can
rely on finding some polished
performers at any public bar
after the races on a Saturday
afternoon.
The student will observe an-
other very odd fact. When it
becomes necessary for these
practitioners, who strew the
four-letter stuff around like
confetti, to refer to the actual
bodily function or the anatomi-
cal part originally conveyed by
these words, they avoid them,
lest their hearers should think
they were merely cursing. They
use instead some handy equiva-
lent, of which there are dozens
in common use in all sizes,
from three letters upwards. It
is quite in order, though, to
garnish these with the “old
originals” if you feel like a bit
of extra emphasis.
A whitewash crusade, by
Lawrence or anybody else, to
rehabilitate the old reliables
and restore them to their
ancient use, is doomed from
the start. They are hopelessly
debased currency, just sheer
foul language and nothing else.
The proletariat has taken them
to its horny bosom for purposes
of personal abuse, and no
man can get them back. — Abie

Most small boys, somewhere along the way,
want to be an enginedriver. I know I did,
most passionately.
My introduction to engineering was as a boy of
twelve, when my reward for cleaning the grease off
locomotives all Saturday afternoon was to be
allowed to “drive” one of them fifty yards into
the round-house.
So there is something sentimental for me in the
fact that steam is being bowed out of the railway
systems of the world. The British Railways have
taken delivery of their last steam locomotive, and
future units will be diesels. Every major railroad
in the United States of America has gone over to
diesel power. In Australia the proportion of diesels
to steam locomotives is steadily rising.
It has been rising since the days when it was
given to me —a lover of steam trains!—to play a
major part in pioneering diesel traction in Australia,
in the first rail-motors installed in Queensland
and Victoria.
But it was steam that opened up this continent.
In the latter half of the last century and the first
quarter of this, the coastal stretches were linked, the
great inland trunk lines were thrust out. To ride
the full distance of Australia’s railways today would
be to cross a distance greater than would be covered
in air mileage in a flight around the world.
The air services now have taken up much of
the fast travel. Road transport has come in to
share the patronage. But trains will still be the
handlers of long, heavy hauls.
Once I heard Marshal Foch say: “Look to a
country’s railway system to get the measure of that
country’s efficiency.” He was speaking as a French
patriot whose country has built one of the finest
railway systems in the world.
That principle of “excellence,” as reflected in
efficient service, holds today for every form of
transport in this country, whatever its means
of traction.
Boys may dream, men at times may be wistful;
but the world is speeding on.

Defence Policy
Once again Federal Cabinet
is to review over-all defence
policies,, while deciding on new
fighters (and bombers?) for the
R.A.A.F., on the future role of
the Navy (more, and perhaps
atomic, submarines), on the
prospects for the aircraft- and
naval-shipbuilding plants, and
on new equipment and training-
methods for the Army. What
re-assessments, if any, will be
made?
A major factor must be the
likely policy of the U.S. in the
Pacific and on South-east Asia
under the new administration.
Another will be the relation-
ships of Red China and Russia,
and possible effects in the
Indian and Pacific Oceans as
well as throughout Southern
and South-east Asia. Yet an-
other is posed by Dutch plans
in West New Guinea.
The Government must also
be realistic in deciding the
extent to which the Anzus and
Seato pacts would be effective
both in helping the defence of
this continent, plus eastern New
Guinea, and in calling upon
Australian aid in the event of
menace to Laos or to Seato
partners. We should be told
who our prospective enemies
are, and where Australian
defence begins. If the answer
is “the Communist bloc,” then
does our frontier begin in
Malaya or North Borneo, and
is it drawn with any effective-
ness in the oceans surrounding
us?
We are paying enough for
our defences, and have paid
enough during the last decade
to be given the answers to
these questions. Frankness to
the fullest extent possible might
make us accept more readily
the heavy financial burden of
security. Charles Meeking
(N.S.W.).
A National Song
Once again Labor M.Ps. are
agitating for an Australian
national-song and recommend-
ing that “Advance, Australia
Fair” be restored to its former
place on A.B.C. programmes,
where it used to usher-in the
news. So far as its verses are
concerned, this hardy perennial
has no especial Labor senti-
ments ; the principal objection
to its resuscitation is that some
people have the suspicion that
it is intended to supersede the


National Anthem. If this
assumption is correct, a lot of
Australians will be willing to
forgo the luxury of a national
song. But if the National
Anthem is still to retain its
pride of place, there can be no
real objection to our enjoying
a national song of our own.
In the days when “Empire”
was a word not to be ashamed
of it was sometimes the custom
at functions held on Empire
(now Commonwealth) Day, to
sing or play all the national
songs of the Empire we could
lay our hands on. “God save
the Queen” (or “King”), how-
ever, would always open or
conclude the performance.
And it all went off very well.
But our national song doesn’t
have to be “Advance, Australia
Fair.” We might do better.
There are other appropriate
songs which might have a more
direct appeal and are, possibly,
of a higher musical and literary
standard. There is one, for
instance, which was once well
known in Victoria and S.A. and
which is still played to herald-in
the A.B.C.’s Guest-of-Honor
session. It is called “Australia”
and opens with the line, “There
is a land where summer skies
are gleaming with a thousand
dyes” ; it has admirable senti-
ments about “shackled slaves”
being unable “to breathe the
air” because only free men can
live in this country ; it contains
no political implications. An-
other good song, with a strong
march-rhythm and no party-
politics, is the work of Mrs.
“Oh, him! He's just a crazy mixed-up squid!”
Ida Lauer, of Adelaide. There
are probably dozens of others
superior to “Advance. Austra-
lia Fair.”
A Sydney columnist has sug-
gested that “Waltzing Matilda,”
with the words changed, might
be the answer. To this, there
are at least two obvious objec-
tions. For one, the “Banjo”
Paterson verses are so popular
that it would be a Herculean
task to bring about the change.
(And most of us would hate to
have the verses altered.) The
other objection is that an Aus-
tralian national - song should
have a tune composed by an
Australian and not one bor-
rowed from a late 19th-century
Scottish song, as is the case
with “Matilda.”
I know, of course, that there
is even some doubt about the
ancestry of the National
Anthem, which has been
claimed variously to be of
English, Swiss, German or
Norse origin. Nevertheless, it
would be fitting if our national-
song were the work of an Aus-
tralian poet and composer. As

the only hope of artificially

!• of some interest to note that the
t L for the year, before tax, is the
Ist on record and that for the second
Je in its history the profits of the
onwanv, before taxation, have exceeded
11000 0 00. The profits, after providing
for tax, were the highest on record, with
ite exception only of those for the
financial year ending June, 1958, which
«re slightly better. Financial critics
and those who study and report on the
published accounts of Companies are
more interested in the profit after tax
(ban in the profit before tax. This is
natural and understandable. However,
i 1 have always contended that the success
' of a Company should be measured by
j the profits before tax. Governments may,
and do, increase or decrease taxation
from time to time, and the amounts by
1 which they raise, or lower, the net profit
is something completely outside the
control of the Board of Directors and
the Company Management.
Sales increased substantially over the
previous year, but so also did costs and
j taxation.
Recent additions to the basic wage and
the increase in margins had the effect of
immediately increasing the wages paid
i>y Bradford Cotton Mills Limited by
approximately £150,000 per annum.
It may surprise you to know that for the
fear just ended the Company paid some
£600,000 more than it would have had
to pay to the same labour force in 1954
and prices over this period were not
increased.
There were, of course, some compensat-
circumstances, but I mention this
point as it is popular amongst many
people who are opposed to manufacturing
Jstries in Australia to try to get the
nbhe generally to believe that all
rease s m wages are promptly passed

value of fixed assets was £1,048,539.

Shareholders
At the 30th June, the Company had
7,509 Shareholders. Of these, 3,104 hold
100 shares, or less, whilst 6,587 hold
500 shares, or less. This widespread
holding of shares is an interesting feature
of the Company’s capital structure. It is
generally not appreciated how wide the
public interest is in an industrial enter-
prise such as Bradford Cotton Mills
Limited.
Development and Expansion
During the year ended June, 1959, the
Company expended £665,000 on capital
equipment as against the sum of
£1,049,000 for the year ended 1960.
This expenditure was financed without
the necessity for calling on the Share-
holders for further contribution of
capital. Included in it was the cost of
erecting a completely new weaving
plant and the ancillary equipment for
the production of sheetings and the dye-
ing and finishing mill necessary to handle
the material coming from this plant.
This unit has been in production for some
weeks and is already working three full
shifts. It is expected that a ready market
will be found for the finished goods.
The other main item of expenditure was
incurred in the purchase and setting up
of Sulzer shuttleless looms. As in other
countries where these looms have been
installed, they have proved to be an
outstanding success.
Fine Spinning Mill
For some time the desirability of enter-
ing the fine spinning business has been
under study by the Management and it
was recently decided that the time was
now opportune to enter this field. This
is the biggest project which has been
undertaken by the Company for many
years. A new building is being erected,
the machinery has been purchased and
if there are no setbacks to the plans, we
will have commenced production before
the end of 1961. The total finance
required for the building, the machinery,
its installation and the financing of raw
materials and finished stocks involves an
investment of about £2,000,000. It is
the first mill of its kind in Australia and,
as it will be producing less than half
the total requirements of the country,
it is not anticipated that there will be
any difficulty in disposing of the produc-
tion.
As the result of representation made to
the Department of Trade, the question
of imposing duties on the importation of
the type of yarn to be produced from
this plant has already been referred to
the Tariff Board.
Further expenditure is planned to
modernise our spinning mill at Footscray
and the spinning mill at Kotara. This,
however, does not necessitate the erection
of any buildings, except of a minor
nature.
Reference is made in the printed report
to the steps which have been taken to
obtain the additional finance to cover
the foregoing developments.
Tariffs
During the year there was a further
inquiry by the Tariff Board into the
question of the duties necessary for the
protection of rayon and other man-made
fibre fabrics. The Tariff Board report
on this inquiry, sent to the Government,
recommended a new scale of duties which
duly became law on being tabled in
Parliament. The indications are that
these new duties will be of considerable
help to the industry.
Furthermore, I made a special visit to
Japan as a representative of the Rayon
and Cotton Weavers’ Association of
Australia. I was accompanied by the
Director of this Association, Mr. A. J.
Burgess. As a result of the representa-
tions which were made to the Man-Made
Fibre Industries of Japan, it is anticipated
that the competition from that source
will not present the same problem as
has been the case heretofore.
The Current Year
Since the close of last year’s operations,
business has been maintained at a satis-
factory rate. Sales and profits are in
excess of the figures for the first four
months last year and orders in hand for
deliveries ahead are satisfactory in every
respect. Our major production units,
including the rayon plant, are working
three full shifts.
General
Mr. S. M. Wreford, who has been Chair-
man of Directors of this Company since
December, 1953, has moved his place of
residence to Perth, Western Australia,
and, in July of this year, he asked to be
relieved of the Chairmanship. He remains
a Director of the Company for the time
being. As already advised, the Board
of Directors elected me to take Mr.
Wreford’s place as Chairman of Direc-
tors.
It is desired to place on record our appre-
ciation of the contribution to the success
of this Company made by Mr. Wreford.
Over the years, Bradford Cotton Mills
Limited has built up a first class Manage-
ment, Executive and Supervisory Staff,
and has gathered together a fine body of
work people, all of whom, by their
loyalty and hard work, have contributed
to the success of the Company and on
behalf of my fellow Directors and myself
I wish to convey our appreciation to
them.
Ladies and gentlemen, I now have much
pleasure in formally moving the adoption
of the Report of the Directors and the
Balance Sheet and the Profit and Loss
Account for the year ended 30th June.
1960.

THE MAN ON
THE LAND
“DON'T WORRY I'M SENDING IT TO
GRAZCOS.”
THE McCAUGHEY MEMORIAL INSTITUTE
Established in June, 1945,
by the late Samuel McCaughey,
of Coree station, Jerildene
(N.S.W.) and David Roy Mc-
Caughey, of Coonong station,
Narrandera, the r McCaughey
Memorial Institute is a
memorial to Lieutenant Samuel
Michael McCaughey (son of
Samuel McCaughey), killed in
action in New Guinea, and of
Sergeant David Leslie Macpher-
son, R.A.A.F. (nephew of the
donors), killed on operations in
Northern Australia.
It was started by a donation
of 24,000 acres of Coree station,
which lies 11 miles west of
Jerilderie, 40 miles n.-w. of
Deniliquin and 36 miles north
of Tocumwal on the Victorian
border, in the heart of the
Riverina and readily- accessible
from every direction.
The Trust
When the institute was first
established a trust was formed
for its administration. First
trustees were Frank Young
(chairman) and Sir Henry
Manning. After the transfer
It is interesting to note
the number of purposes
that the United King-
dom’s wool dip is being
put to. Long-stapled
fleeces from Scottish
Blackface sheep find a
ready market from
Italian housewives in
the stuffing of mat-
tresses. Shorter, finer
wool with felting quali-
ties is used on rollers
in the manufacture of
paper; Lincoln wool,
which is long and
strong, is used exten-
sively for bunting and
street decorations.
It is also interesting to
note the- number of
graziers using and
recommending Elastra-
tor, for all castrating
and tailing. As they
all know the Elastrator
method is bloodless,
which lessens the infec-
tion by germ-laden flies
and insects. Elastra-
tor is the humane
method; lambs do not
suffer the cruelty of
other old - fashioned
methods. Elastrator,
used and recommended
by graziers everywhere.
of land from Coree to the in-
stitute was completed, D. R.
McCaughey was also appointed
a trustee. When Frank Young
died in 1950, Sir Henry Man-
ning became chairman and J.
P. Abbott joined the board.
In October, 1959, the senate
“I'll be glad when he gets past the doll stage.”
of Sydney University con-
sented to the appointment of
the Vice-Chancellor of the Uni-
versity as an ex-officio member
of the board, and Professor S.
H. Roberts, present Vice-Chan-
cellor, became a trustee.
To assist in developing the
institute’s aims the trustees
appointed an advisory commit-
tee, which at present consists
of three scientists from Sydney
University (Professor H. R.
Carne, Dean of the Faculty of
Veterinary Science; Professor
J. R. A. McMillan, Dean of
the Faculty of Agriculture;
Professor T. J. Robinson, Pro-
fessor of Animal Husbandry)
and three graziers (A. F.
Crockett, of Wononga, Jeril-
derie ; G. E. Crouch, ex-mana-
ger of Coree Pastoral Co. Pty.,
Ltd. ; and N. D. Gamble,
present manager of Coree). .
Valuable assistance in re-
search is also given by Profes-
sor David McFarlane of Syd-
ney University, Dr. M. C.
Franklin, of the McMaster
Laboratory and H. J. Geddes,
officer-in-charge of University
Farms, Camden.
Aims of the Trust
The aims of the trust are to
conduct research into the prob-
lems of dry land and irrigated
pastures, to demonstrate the
most up-to-date methods of
management and production,
to act as an educational and
research centre for the sur-
rounding district, and to train
young men as pastoralists or
pastoral managers.
The institute is closely linked
with the University of Sydney,
and two Research Fellows have
been appointed and form an
integral part of the University
research-team.
The trustees plan to develop
the irrigable area as a demon-
stration of intensive production
under irrigation, and to estab-
lish studs of high-quality dairy-
cattle and beef-cattle, as well
as a Merino stud and mutton-
breeds of sheep. It is hoped to
provide high-quality livestock
for farmers in the district and
to make available the qualities
of proven dairy-bulls by estab-
lishing an A.I. centre.
History and Topography
When the property was
donated it consisted only of the
land and buildings, and for
some years it was leased back
to the Coree Pastoral Co.

Rabbits
“C.E.W.”: The recent con-
ference on rabbit - control
which C.5.1.R.0. chairman Dr.
F. W. G. White opened in
Sydney was the second of its
kind in two years. The other
was held in Melbourne in
1958, and the fact that the
C.5.1.R.0. now arranged this
further gathering shows how
important the rabbit-problem
still is.
The Sydney conference was
attended by research-workers,
senior members of rabbit-
control authorities from all
Australian States and repre-
sentatives of primary-producer
organisations. Its aim was to
give delegates an opportunity
to pool knowledge and to
share experience and informa-
tion about control-measures.
Dr. White pointed out that
myxomatosis would not pro-
vide the final answer to the
rabbit-problem. In fact, he
said, by keeping numbers
down but by allowing the sur-
vival of a nucleus from which
numbers could again grow to
pest-proportions, myxomatosis
tends to restrict thinking and
planning. People have come to
rely on it to stabilise rabbit-
populations at an acceptable
low level, but as the virus loses
its power and as rabbits be-
come increasingly resistant to
it, there is need to supplement
its effects by poisoning.
F. N. Ratcliffe, officer-in-
charge of the C.5.1.R.0. Wild-
life Survey Section, pointed out
that the real problem now is a
psychological one: “Rabbits in
small numbers do not evoke
an attitude of urgency but
even small numbers are a
menace.” Fortunately, he said,
the growing use of the poison
known as 1080, laid from the
air, offers a successful means
of control.
Use of aerial bait-laying has
been chiefly developed in Vic-
toria.
Rabbits, it seems, particu-
larly in the breeding-season,
have a strongly defined social
hierarchy which includes a
clear sense of territory. Except
for the dominant buck in any
given population, rabbits do
not wander from their own
home territory into territory
belonging to another group. If
they do they are hunted away.
This means that to get anything
like a 100 per cent, kill from
a poisoning operation the
poison - furrow must pass
through the territory of every
group —not generally possible
by normal methods. Aerial
baiting achieves this, however,
since the bait is spread in wide
swathes throughout the in-
fested areas.
Other research has stressed
the importance of correct
“free-feeding.” Some rabbits
are unlikely to take bait the
first few times they find it, and
it is therefore essential to give
shy feeders plenty of time to
get used to the bait offered.
Best baits are carrots and oats.
Carrots are acceptable to
rabbits all the year round, but
oats, being drier, are generally
only acceptable in winter.
These points must be taken
into account in any poisoning-
campaign.
Rabbits are kept down fairly
well in Tasmania by teams em-
ployed by the Department of
Agriculture. In Western Aus-
tralia rabbit-numbers seem to
have risen.
T. L. Bull, oF Narrandera
(N.S.W.), a member of the
Rabbit Control Advisory
Council, said that by re-
organising control-measures in
N.S.W. it should be possible to
get rid of all rabbits from large
areas. There was, however,
little incentive for landholders
to put the necessary effort into
control when rabbit-popula-
tions had already been reduced
to a stage where they seemed to
be no real problem.
The Leichhardt (Q.) Rabbit
Board was represented by J.
Corbett, who described how
his board had. been able to
poison 100,000 acres for about
Is. an acre. A high level of
success had been achieved—
again by having the work done
by experts instead of by land-
holders who, in most cases,
would have to rely on inexpert
casual labor.
Towards the end of the con-
ference B. V. Fennessy, of the
C.5.1.R.0. Wildlife Survey
Section, urged that rabbits
should be completely wiped-
out and that nothing less than
this should be the aim of con-
trol authorities and land-
holders everywhere.
The Wheat Industry
“Nyara”: M.H.R. for
Maranoa (1949-55), and a well-
known Queensland wheat-
grower and flourmiller, C. W.
Russell recently described the
export outlook for the Aus-
tralian wheat industry as
“bleak,” and said the industry
was “drifting rather than being
wisely guided.”
A symptom of this, he said,
was a recent announcement by
the Federal Government that it
would have to subsidise the
industry by £6.7 million.
He urged a return to market-
ing wheat overseas through
private selling-agents, in order
“to restore sensitivity to the
outside market.”
Price no longer controlled
production ; the industry had
been socialised, as far as
marketing was concerned. Free
enterprise could produce the
wheat, all right; the trouble
lay with the Australian Wheat
Bureau, which controlled
marketing. '
The Australian Wheat Board

11, when, Russell said, “this
country went into an economic
straitjacket.”
“Most of our overseas com-
petitors came out of their strait-
jackets when the war ended,
but we did not.”
Russell claims that a study
of milling-records proves that
Australian wheat had deterior-
ated over the years. This
deterioration might be over-
come if the f.a.q. system of
grading were changed and a
system similar to that used in
Canada adopted.
Australia was not safeguard-
ing itself against inevitable
competition from world sur-
pluses, particularly in the
U.S.A. Ex po r t prices will
probably continue to fall while
Australian costs are still rising
(a problem the woolgrower is
up against, too).
Russell thinks that the board
should at least encourage
specialisation in wheat qualities
to suit special markets. Fewer
inferior wheats, which are
doing Australia no good, would
then be grown.
With quality in wheat,
traditional markets would be
secured in the face of U.S.
competition —and in particular,
we “should not overlook our
traditional market in Great
Britain.”
Dairying in the
Territory
“D.C.T.”: The “N.T. News”
of 7/10/’6O reported that
dairying is beginning to get a
foothold in the “top end,”
adding that pioneer dairyman
Rupert Kentish was importing
a milk-bottling machine from
England (due to arrive this
month). An issue of a few
days earlier mentioned that 57
head of dairy-cattle were
unloaded off the boat Inger
Clausen.
Darwin, one of the fastest
growing cities in Australia,
now has a population of more
than 10,000, and, as its milk-
suppliers, some of our young
dairyfarmers from the coastal
areas of Queensland and
N.S.W. could find a profitable
opening in the Katherine-
Darwin country.
Most Darwin people still de-
pend on tinned milk, either
condensed or powdered, but
would certainly prefer the
fresh article. I believe that if
a group of young and experi-
enced men started along the
Katherine and built a modest
pasteurising plant they would
do well.
Katherine is only five hours’
run from Darwin on the bitu-
men, and the railways, with
their diesel-service, are now
equipped to handle freight
much more efficiently than
they were a few years ago.
Also, because of its lime-
content, the Katherine water
is superior to that supplied at
Darwin, especially for stock.
Darwin is a thirsty spot,
and while most of its inhabit-
ants are beer-drinkers, sup-
porting two breweries, there is
a substantial and growing de-
mand for milk-shakes.
Those interested should write
to Hugh Barclay, Director of
Lands in Darwin, for infor-
mation about what land is
available and the conditions of
tenure. Barclay has been in
the Territory for years and
knows the country thoroughly.
The Department of Territories
grants substantial subsidies on
freight for purebred stock, and
the capital involved in starting
in the “top end” is substan-
tially less than is needed to
buy and equip a dairyfarm in
the southern States.
Of course, those tackling the
job must be prepared to work.
If they are they will find the
rewards well worth while.
N.Z. Shearing Festival
“0.W.W.”: The shears will
go click again at the 1961
Golden Fleece Shearing Festi-
val to be held in Masterton
(N.Z.) from March 8-11.
Among numerous other
machine-shearing events, for
prizes totalling £485, there will
be a special Australasian Blade
Shearing Championship. First
prize is £6O, and there is a total
of £135 for the event.
Wool-handling, and other
shed events, will also earn prize-
money for N.Z. and Australian
competitors.
Mechanical Sugar-
cane Harvesting
“North”: Shortage of labor
in Queensland’s sugar-growing
districts has caused farmers to
speed-up introduction of
mechanical loaders and har-
vesters for taking off the cane.
Early in September the Sugar
Industry Mechanical Harvest-
ing Committee made a tour of
inspection of the chief produc-
ing areas around Mossman,
Innisfail, Ingham, Ayr, Mackay
and Bundaberg, to study and
evaluate the merits of the
various forms of harvesters,
techniques and methods of
transport, and to plan their
future approach to problems of
harvesting and development.
Both millers and growers
recognise that the industry
must strive to bring in mechani-
cal harvesting as quickly as
possible to reduce growers’
costs. Two types of mechanical
harvesters are in use; one
chops the cane into short
lengths ; the other handles the
stick in one piece. The task of
the S.I.M.H.C. is to select the
machine best suited to the
work, and introduce it on the
farms.
Present cane - wagons are
built to carry whole sticks, and
millers naturally don’t wish to
convert their transport-systems
to bin-carriers which can
accommodate chopped cane
until a definite type has been
decided upon. Also, there’s no
point in adopting a particular
machine which could become
obsolete overnight for in-
stance, a more efficient machine
capable of harvesting whole
sticks of falling cane should be
developed. One mill-manager
has estimated that it would cost
£250,000 to convert his mill’s
transport - system to carry
chopped cane.

from J Jat the average
V greater sbee P was
is b« fr r plain -
SLZ* tbe most
ul scove ry f rom the
experiments was the association
of body-wrinkle with low fer-
tility.
About 600 to 700 sheep have
been used in each control-
group in the trials, wrinkled
and plain-bodied. The number
of lambs weaned from the ewes
in the plain-bodied control-
group has been nearly double
that from the ewes in the
wrinkled group.
Dr. Dun said that these
figures still had to be con-
firmed by results from other
experiment-stations. However,
the first experiments by the
Queensland Department of
Agriculture station at Julia
Creek showed a difference of
32 per cent, in fertile ewes in
favor of the plain-bodied sheep
over wrinkled.
Experiments are still being
made at Trangie. A lambing
percentage of 140 per cent, has
been achieved in trials from
the plain-bodied sheep.
This points to the greater
economic importance of the
Merino as a fat-lamb mother
and a breeder of crossbred
ewes.
Yellowberry
“Acacia”: Yellowberry, an
Asian plant lately declared a
noxious weed throughout
Queensland, is a coarse
bramble which forms dense
thickets.
Its primary canes, growing
upright at first and then bend-
ing over at heights from 3ft.
to Bft. to take root and form
new crowns, are densely
covered with stiff, bristle-like
hairs and bear hooked prickles
at intervals along the stem.
The flowering canes are
short and slender, growing
from the forks of leaves along
the primary canes. These also
have bristly hairs and scat-
tered prickles. The dark
glossy-green leaves are about
4in. long and wide, those
on the flowering canes being
usually smaller.
Flowers, borne in groups
at or near the ends of the
short flowering canes, consist
of five white petals; fruits
are like blackberries in size,
shape and texture, but are
pale yellow.
First noticed near Eumundi
in 1912, yellowberry has slowly
Spread along the Blackall
Range, and lately has appeared
near Maryborough in the
north and as far south as
Pimpana, near Brisbane. It’s
a threat to the good dairying
country of the coastal belt,
and as the fruit is edible, the
seed is rapidly spread by
birds.
Fortunately, the plant is
easy to control by spraying
with hormones. It can be
killed with 2,4, 5-T or a mix-
ture of 2,4, D and 2,4, 5-T,
provided the application is
thorough. When using a 40 per
cent. 2,4, 5-T, mix If liquid
oz. to 3gals. of water and
spray the bushes until
thoroughly wet. If the 2, 4 D-
and-2, 4, 5-T mixture is used,
double the amount of hor-
mone. This will kill the greater
proportion of the bushes, and
the few survivors can be re-
sprayed later.
Do not burn-off the sprayed
plants for at least six months
after treatment. Then, when
the bushes are dead, sow grass-
seed to form permanent
pasture.
Farm Hints
“Pat O’Day”: Very young
poddy-lambs are best housed
in the shed at night and on
cold, wet days. Put them in a
deep box with wood-shavings
on the floor and wire-netting
on top. Feed each lamb about
i cup pure milk with 1 table-
spoon hot water added and
warmed with'a hot poker to
sterilise it. When lambs are
10 days old, feed them at four-
hourly intervals through the
day.
“Efemay”: Where a fairly
large number of sheep are to
be shorn, have a couple of
pet-sheep at the shed to lead
the others in. Keep these pets
in a yard nearby and hand-
feed them, so that they will
be available when each lot
arrives to be shedded. Keep
all dogs out of the yards and
shed and you’ll avoid making
the sheep confused.
REPORT FROM CROHAMHURST
(3/11/’60)
There should be moderate to good rains in much of
Queensland during December, with heavy falls along part of
the south coast, though the western and far-south-western
districts may have only light rain. Similar rains should
continue in January, but falls may be patchy in far-western
districts.
Light to moderate patchy rains are likely in most of
N.S.W. during December, with better falls along the North
Coast, on the Northern Tablelands and in north-western
districts. In January there should be moderate to good rains
along the coast, on the tablelands and in the north-western
districts.
Victoria may have only light patchy rains in December,
and, apart from good rains in the central division and Gipps-
land, rainfall will probably be light in January.
South Australia will probably have poor rainfall in
December, and conditions for January look like being mainly
dry. There should be some moderate rain in central districts
during February.
Good storm-rains are likely in part of Western Aus-
tralia in December, though conditions may be dry about the
Fortescue and West Gascoyne.

Information Sought
What is the clause from the
( British ) Obscene Publications Act
relevant to the ‘‘Lady Chatterley”
case ?
The Act (1959) provides that it
is an offence to publish an obscene
article and that “an article shall
be deemed to be obscene if its
effect or (where the article com-
prises two or more distinct items)
the effect of any one of its items
is, if taken as a whole, such as to
tend to deprave and corrupt persons
who are likely, having regard to
all relevant circumstances, to read,
see or hear the matter contained
or embodied in it.” It is a defence
if the accused person can show that
he had not examined the article,
and had no reasonable cause to
suspect that it was obscene. The
Act also provides that obscene
articles can only be seized on a
search-warrant and then only if
kept for publication for gain. An
amendment to the original Act
secured the admissibility of expert
evidence as to the literary, artistic
or scientific merits of the matter
charged as obscene.

Brief outline of the growth of
orchestral music in Sydney since
1900 ?
As a rival to an existing college
of music, founded by Hector Mac-
lean, an Englishman, W. H. Wale,
formed the Sydney Conservatorium
in 1901, and the next year a bequest
was left for the promotion of music
at Sydney University. In 1903 Dr.
Arundel Orchard arrived to conduct
the Sydney Liedertafel and later the
Philharmonic, adding impetus to
the growing demand for orchestral
concerts. In 1908 he accepted the
conductorship of the new Sydney
Symphony Orchestra, and Joseph
Bradley arrived to impart the
English choral tradition to the
Philharmonic.
About this time Ernest Wunder-
lich came to the forefront among
those pressing for Government
support for music in New South
Wales, appealing through the press
for the Government to establish a
Chair of Music, subsidise a sym-
phony orchestra and build a
concert - hall. Opposition was
“I can’t bear heights, you know.”
strong, but in 1914 the State Con-
servatorium was founded, the
inaugural concert being held on
May 6, 1915, when the conductors
were Orchard, Bradley and Alfred
Hill (who died only recently in
Sydney).
First director of the Conserva-
torium was Henri Verbrugghen,
who formed an excellent choir with
which he toured New Zealand,
taking the orchestra as well, on two
occasions after Sydney concerts and
country tours had proved an out-
standing success. When he left in
1922, to become conductor of the
Minneapolis Symphony Orchestra,
he was succeeded by Orchard.
Orchard started with the dis-
advantage of having the Govern-
ment subsidies withdrawn, but the
orchestra, which had to be dis-
banded, gradually built-up again
and the Government eventually
renewed the subsidies. One im-
portant development was the
foundation of the Conservatorium
Opera School in 1925, from which
students gave annual performances
in conjunction with professional
singers.
The most important feature of
the 1920’5, not only with regard
to orchestral music, was the num-
ber of tours made by world-
famous artists, coupled with the
local and overseas success of Aus-
tralian artists, notably Melba. Visit-
ing artists included Kreisler, Back-
haus, Chaliapin and Paderewski.
Since that time the outstanding
factor in the progress of Austra-
lian mttsic has been the work of
the A.B.C. The inaugural cere-
mony of the A.B.C. took place
at the Sydney Conservatorium in
July of 1932, and immediately
following its formation it engaged
small orchestras in both Sydney
and Melbourne. In 1936 the Com-
mission decided on a policy of
building a symphony orchestra in
each State and to bring overseas
conductors and soloists to improve
standards. The successful imple-
mentation of this policy, particu-
larly with the Sydney Orchestra, is
largely the history of the growth
of Australian orchestras since then.

Veteran Violinist
No bow wielded over a Strad
this century has produced a
tone richer and warmer than
that conjured by Fritz Kreisler
for half a century until his
recent retirement —and he is
now getting on towards 80.
His playing, in fact, brought a
new descriptive term to music
—the “Kreisler tone.” On an
R.C.A. Camden disk (CAM 46)
Kreisler has put together 11
short pieces. They include his
own glorious miniature, “Ron-
dino on a Theme by Beet-
hoven” ; Two Slavonic Dances
and the “Indian Lament” of
Dvorak and Albeniz’s “Tango”
and “Malaguena,” all Kreisler
arrangements; Debussy’s
“Boating” and “Girl with the
Flaxen Hair” ; and a brace of
pieces by de Falla. For
admirers of the master, this is
certainly one for the cabinet.

The Light and Bright
The long string of Viennese
operettas which the industrious
Franz von Suppe churned-out
for 35 years mostly lie dust-
choked. Mention Suppe today,
and the term synonymous with
his name is “Poet and Peasant.”
That overture, and the other
three which together seem to
be the summation of his life’s
work —“Light Cavalry,” “Pique
Dame,” and “Morning, Noon
and Night in Vienna” —are
compassed on a Decca disk,
Suppe Overtures (LXT 5548).
All have the typical Suppe
touch of dramatic episodes be-
ing grafted on to buoyant
rhythms, with a faint aura of
Italian- opera flamboyance
hovering over all of them.
Easily digested musical pabu-
lum, and played ebulliently by
the Vienna Philharmonic under
Georg Solti.
Three for Dancing
Say It With Music (Coronet
KLP 887) is Ray Connif’s latest
set of dance-arrangements of
popular tunes by Irving Berlin,
George Gershwin, Sigmund
Romberg, Cole Porter and
Peter de Rose. Connif has a
clever way of blending voices
in as extra instruments for his
orchestra, and in this collec-
tion each has a Latin beat.
The Latin beat is present,
too, in Camden’s Everybody
Cha Cha! (CAM 45) recorded
by the Fred Astaire Dance
Studio Orchestra. There are
some strange matings on this
platter. There’s nothing sur-
prising in cha-cha-ing to “Poin-
ciana,” “Cielito Lindo,” or “Ay
Ay Ay,” and if you didn’t cha-
cha to “Cha Cha Ku-ka-ra-
cha,” what would you do to it?
But when it comes to “Loch
Lomond,” well, 125 Fred Astaire
dance-studios can’t be wrong.
Henry Mancini is best known
these days as the man who
supplies the music for “Peter

other TV-shows, but in The

R.C.A. presents an album of
jazz dispensed by Mancini and
a massive team of instrumenta-
lists. “Smoke Rings,” “Blue

“Mood Indigo” are among the
better known titles.
More Music from “Peter

the Mancini sound-track of the

Gongs Blast
Chico Hamilton, band-leader
and master-drummer, claims
that his present quintet is the
swingin’est he’s ever swung
with —and he should know. On
Gongs East (Warner Bros.
W 1271) they swing their way
through a programme which
begins with “Beyond the Blue
Horizon,” takes in the Jerome
Kern number “Long Ago” and
proceeds by easy stages to “Far
East” and “Passion Flower,”
each item swingin’ like swing.
The title-piece, “Gongs East,”
is Chico’s own composition.

MELBOURNE
Dame Mary Herring was present at
the delightful luncheon given at the
Lyceum Club by Lady Giddy, the former
wearing a frock-and-jacket ensemble of
white silk printed in blue flowers and
leaves, and a navy mushroom - hat
swathed with matching tulle, the hos-
tess a pink - and - white tailored silk
frock and a small black hat. Among
other guests were Mrs. James Buchanan,
wearing a slim frock of gold-and-brown
floral-silk and a beehive-hat of gold
straw swathed in beige tulle; Mrs.
D. F. R. Evans, in black-and-white silk
frock; and Mrs. W. F. E. Schrader,
whose navy linen suit, the jacket bound
in white braid, was worn with a white
rose-trimmed navy straw hat.
This function'was held to discuss future
plans for the Road to Hope Appeal for
Spastic Children, which will run from
today, November 16, to December 24.
The Spastic Children’s Society needs
£lOO,OOO if it is to extend the scope of
its work. Dame Mary said that one great
need was a hostel where spastic children
could be accommodated for short periods
to allow their mothers to have a holi-
day. The appeal will be opened by the
Premier at the Town Hall. One impor-
tant item on the November 30 pro-
gramme will be the commencement of
Hostess Week, for which women
throughout Victoria have been asked to
give parties of any type and size and
request their guests to contribute to the
appeal. Parties already promised will be
given by Mrs. Frank May, Mrs. Dermot
Connelly, Mrs. Murray Peden and Mrs.
lan Beaurepaire. On December 12 there
will be a Fair in the Lower Town Hall,
with accent on Christmas gifts ; and on
December 16 there will be a gala-
performance by the Borovansky Ballet
of “The Sleeping Princess.” Dame Mary
Herring is patroness of the women’s
committee, Lady Giddy president, Mrs.
James Buchanan chairman, Mrs. D. F. R.
Evans hon. secretary and Mrs. W.
Schrader is handling the publicity.

It was a full house at Her Majesty’s
for the first night of the Borovansky’s
second ballet-programme, which opened
with the graceful all - white “Les
Sylphides.” Dressing-glamor was ad-
versely affected by the cold, wet weather,
but despite this there were quite a few
eye-appealing ensembles. Mrs. Graeme
Laws was outstanding in a short, bell-
skirted frock of white silk-taffeta printed
in a floral design, over which she wore
a white Arctic-fox stole. Lady Tait high-
lighted with a necklace of many strings
of crystals a short black taffeta frock.
Bands of sapphire-blue mink embellished
the black velvet theatre-coat worn by
Mrs. George Gardner. A scarlet silk-
taffeta coat was worn by Mrs. Jim
Campbell, a raspberry-red faille one by
Mrs. L. Withers, who was with her
daughter, Mrs. John McCallum.
The Lady Mayoress, Mrs. Bernard
Evans, who has never spared herself in
her social and charitable work, has
gathered together a large number of
women, including members of her family,
in organising the International Fair, to
be held in the Town Hall on November
29, to assist the Lord Mayor's Hospital
Fund. There will be stalls for cakes,
jams, toys, Christmas-decorations, gifts
and baby-clothes, and all those who want
to help may send parcels to Mrs. Evans
at the Town Hall. Photo by John
Warlow.
Sir Alexander Fitzgerald was guest-
speaker at the Royal Commonwealth
Society’s luncheon in the lower Town
Hall. He was accompanied by Lady
Fitzgerald, whose frock and waist-length
jacket of sapphire-blue silk-shantung had
for company a flower-toque in cream,
brown and green. Mr. J. R. Kinsman,
chairman of the branch, with Mrs.
Olivia Gardener (she wearing a tweed
suit in grey-green tonings and a match-
ing straw cloche), received the official
guests, among whom were Brigadier and
Mrs. R. W. Tovell, Sir John Latham,
Mrs. G. E. Fitzgerald, Mrs. J. B.
Hayter and Mr. and Mrs. P. Hosking.

the example of Antony Armstrong
Jones and Jacqueline Kennedy.
But seriously, the best advice one can
give parents and children leaving school
is, when there is a doubt about what
occupation the children should enter, get
professional advice.
There are two vocational-guidance
centres in Sydney. One is conducted by
the Department of Labor and Industry.
Its services are free and it handles 25,000
cases per year. The other is the Aus-
tralian Institute of Industrial Psychology,
a non-profit-making organisation which
has been established longer than any
other. The charges made are moderate.
A second piece of advice. If the child
has the ability to learn a skilled trade
or a profession, don’t let him (or her)
take an unskilled job with no prospects
just because it is easy and well-paid.
But don’t use the word “dead-end” in
reference to any job. Unskilled work
must be done in this world and there
are from 10 to 15 per cent, of the
working-population who are happiest
when doing it. To speak of them as being
in “dead-end” jobs is unfair and, indeed,
ungrateful.
Mrs. D. J. Cartledge will be matron-

G. C. Oldham, D.S.C., A.D.C. The ball

The art-show of the week could be
none other than that of Albert Tucker’s
works at David Jones’ Gallery. That it
was a prestige affair you realised immedi-
ately you parted, slightly reluctantly, with
your 4s. for a catalogue.
The pictures bore no such vulgar
symbol as a price, nor did the catalogue
deign to discuss the subject; but discreet
inquiry revealed that the average price
was £450 and the top £750. If you have
the courage to ask, “Could I see some-
thing just a little less expensive?” you
will be told that there is just one at £l5O.
Even so, there are several red dots to be
seen, mostly from Melbourne and the
National Art Gallery.
Mr. Tucker was present at the open-
ing, having returned to Australia after
13 years abroad. He looked Brioni-
tailored, brown tones predominating,
including the curly beard. He did not
look at all like the Australians in his
paintings, but, then neither did any of
those present, for according to Mr.
Tucker the Antipodean has holes in his
head. Professor J. P. Baxter, Vice-
Chancellor of the University of N.S.W.,
who opened the show, said that these
heads suggest something very Australian.
Perhaps it’s the Australian myth.
P.S. to these remarks. These pictures
seem powerful and dramatic, and for
anyone with £750 lying around loose,
they might be just the thing to fill up an
odd corner.

Dr. Joyce Ackroyd, who is Assistant
Professor to the School of Oriental
Studies in Canberra, gave a most learned
address to members of Ikebana Inter-
national (Sydney Branch) during the
week on the subject of Japanese flower-
arrangement, its history and spiritual
significance. Dr. Ackroyd was a student
of Professor Sadler at Sydney University
and also came under his influence when
she was studying at Cambridge. Her talk
naturally included some discussion of
the Japanese tea-ceremony, with which
the history of flower-arrangement is
tied-up, and two films on these subjects
illustrated her comments.
Mrs. E. G. Waterhouse, who presided
at the meeting held at the Nurses’
Memorial Club, said that there are three
branches of Ikebana International in
Australia —Sydney, Melbourne and Lis-
more. There are 80 members in the
Sydney branch.

Nursery, it will show about 70 examples

open to one and all for a modest 2s.


penalise Lawrence simply because he
is readable? Is it democratic to allow
the select few of the intellectuals to
read rude words denied to the masses?
Is the ordinary reader really likely to
be corrupted and depraved by words
which have done no perceptible harm
to readers of the classics and of poetry?
Fair or not, that is how it stands now
in Australia; and certainly the censors
do face a different problem when the
rude words are likely to be circulated
as widely as they will be if “Lady
Chatterley” breaks free.
What tricky little beasts these seven
or eight unbearable four-letter words
are! There was a most interesting
letter in a Sydney daily recently which
said that the worst word of all was
genuinely filthy, or at least animal,
because it was an active verb, did not
imply co-operation or tenderness on
the part of the lovers, and was there-
fore equivalent to “rape”—an uncivi-
lised concept of love. That seemed a
most telling argument, until one
reflected that the same word is also
used as a noun; which, if still crude,
could certainly imply co-operation.
Then there was another letter which
argued that the words could not pos-
sibly be filthy because their synonyms,
meaning exactly the same thing, were
everywhere accepted. If you can call
a cat a “feline,” how can it possibly be
wrong to call it a cat? If you can
write “fornication,” how can it pos-
sibly be wrong to write.... what I
know I cannot write here?
Well, there are clearly limits to what
one can—as yet —print in a newspaper;
and there may be something generally
to be said for polite circumlocution
even in literature. These taboos in
speech, in writing and in behavior, go
deep. They arise from a desire to
prettify and make mysterious the crude
facts of sex, thereby making it more
attractive. They arise from respect
for women: which is a pleasant and
delicate phenomenon. They also arise
from a desire to protect the family,
which is the basis of society, and which
would be destroyed by too much
promiscuity. Deeper still, I suspect
that they arise from man’s instinc-
tive feeling that his evolutionary, not
merely his animal, origin, is rather
beneath his dignity : and by that instinct
we have risen to be civilised men.
But the printed book is the last
refuge of honesty, and a refuge which
it is vitally important to maintain. We
have grown to be civilised not only by
setting up standards of decorum, but
also by laughing at the crude facts of
life and also by facing them. Lawrence
could never be a Rabelais and laugh
at the comedy of the body; but he did
in this novel face the facts —seriously,
high-mindedly and with goodwill to
life —with a frankness that no other
serious writer (unless he has been cen-
sored out of existence) has dared to
attempt.
If sometimes Lawrence overstated
his case to the point of absurdity, as he
did in some of the love-scenes and
particularly when he tried to be tender
instead of simply amused at the excre-
tory functions, nevertheless it was a
well-meant and basically a healthy
absurdity. “Lady Chatterley’s Lover”
is a supremely courageous and sincere
novel and, whatever shocks it may
cause, I cannot bring myself to believe
that any censor has the right to sup-
press it. And, after all, the four-letter
words are silly little things, really, to
be so frightened about. Once you
have seen them a few times in print it
is amazing how soon they lose force.
But “Lady Chatterley’s Lover” is
just one book; and perhaps, as a
London “Times” leader has indicated,
the real problem in releasing it is the
fear of what may come next. Will its
free circulation in England or Australia
lead to a general loosening'of stand-
ards? Are there going to be rude four-
letter words in every book you pick up?
It is possible. The reading public
may be horrified; it may just get used
to them; or. as is most likely, it will set
up its own unofficial censorship and
refuse to read what it doesn’t want to.
But it is also possible that most writers
will continue to use the circumlocutions
because they are usually in better taste
and because they know that expletives
—when the rude words are used as
such—get a false emphasis in print and
anyhow are usually superfluous. Now
that they know they can print the one
rude word which, for freedom’s sake,
they have been longing to and which
they have been using in increasingly
thin disguises, writers may just not
bother about it. If the thing does start
to get out of hand and writers are using
merely for sensationalism or porno-
graphy the words that Lawrence used
with such impassioned sincerity, the
censors will face some difficulties. But
every book, surely, must be tested on
its own merits, not on its possible
successors.

Stanislavsky
It is a measure of the confusion that
has gathered around the subject of
“method” acting that a book like
Robert Lewis’s Method —or Madness
(Heinemann), which amounts to little
more than an explanation of Stani-
slavsky’s theories in clear, common-
sense terms, should seem to have some-
thing of the force usually associated
with works of original thought.

The Vienna Genesis: Emmy Wellesz

“Genesis” is a Greek text in silver on
purple parchment above illustrations in.
color. One complete page is shown in
monochrome, and there are eight
tipped-in color-plates faced by trans-
lations of the relevant texts. The intro-
duction by Emmy Wellesz summarises
the research that has been done on
this fragmentary 48-page manuscript,
and concludes after consideration of
the hair-style of Potiphar’s wife and
many less frivolous considerations, that
it was painted between 400-500 A.D.
The pictures of the Flood, the clothing
of Noah by his sons modestly walking
backwards, Rebekah at the well, Esau
selling his birthright, Laban’s sheep,
Joseph and Potiphar’s wife, Joseph and
the baker, and Jacob’s sons visiting
their father, are derived from a “late-
classical archetype” of either Alex-
andria or Antioch; classical decadence
at a point where it might be said to
be the equivalent of the primitive
paintings that five or six centuries later
began the Italian renascence.

A Time In Rome: Elizabeth Bowen
(Longmans). An atmospheric repro-
duction of ancient Rome by a woman
holidaying in the present-day city. She
is pretty good on. the continual noise in
old Rome’s streets at night; on how
much the yellow classical architecture
had to answer for in inspiring the grimy,
grey copies of it in Government build-
ings in cold, northern cities; on the
dangers that old Rome’s tall flat-
buildings would fall; on Livia. wife of
the Emperor Augustus, her daily life as
compared with that of Napoleon’s
Josephine; of early Christians in Rome;
of the possibility that the Romans
might not have been as amorous as
scandal makes them, because of those
“narrow, rack-like” couches . . . The
famous essayist thinks of the strangest
things, and blends them into five long
meditations which no critical article
could properly disentangle.

How to Cook for an Ulcer: Eileen
Keane (Angus and Robertson). At
first glance this little book of recipes
for soups, toast-dishes, egg-dishes, fish,
meat, pastry desserts, scones, cakes and
biscuits, looks as though ulcer-men
might wake-up and live, but a closer
inspection shows that theirs must be a
thin time, thinly disguised: no frying
stews before stewing; no onions. One’s
wife, however, says it’s a very good
little book, particularly as it summarises
what she has been saying all the time;
not only will it minister to the ulcerous,
but it will prevent the unulcerous from
being ulcerated. In these grim terms
one recommends it.

The Poetry Bookshelf: Coleridge,
edited by lames Reeves; Emily Dickin-
son, edited by James Reeves (Heine-

selections, with long introductions and
short notes. The Coleridge is about
as much as anyone would need. It
makes a specialty of “Dejection, a
Letter,” the complete text, unpublished
until 1947, from whose 340 lines
Coleridge himself used only 139 lines
in “Dejection, an Ode.” The Emily
Dickinson selection is of 181 poems
from her 1175 poems and fragments.
They have this peculiarity, that a piece
you pass over today may come vividly
alive tomorrow. Her poems were like
a scattering of broken glass, and the
light strikes them at different angles at
different times.

Haakon Chevalier (Cape). Study of an
American physicist of genius who
married a Communist wife and set out
to betray secrets to Russia. He also
involved his friend from the Security
Service in Communism, and then, when
he was questioned, exonerated himself
by implicating his friend. A novel.of
a cold mind that lost wife, friend and
everything in a ruthless pursuit of
power; more an effort to trace the twists
and treacheries of a clever mind than
a book of action —books on men of
genius, painters, poets and mathema-
ticians are never completely satisfying
for an obvious reason.
