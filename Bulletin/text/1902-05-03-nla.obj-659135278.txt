Insomnia.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
For days I have not slept. For days and days
Of pain long-drawn and utter weariness
I have not had one single second’s grace,
Nor any moment’s lifting of the load
Of measureless anguish that weighs down on me.
And now to-night—indeed, I scarcely dare
To think it—now to-night it seems I may
Find sleep at last, and cease from consciousness.
I have not slept for centuries, I think;
I have forgotten what it is to sleep.
I only know that blessedness is there,
And peace ...
My brain swims in a lurid sea
Of sulky semi-consciousness. And now
I sink—l fall at meteoric speed
Through limitless space. For ages so I fall—
Ages and ages—all a listless blurr.
Substance has left me, and, attenuate,
I hurtle downwards through the ashen void
Swift as the glimmer of a new-lit star
To dark abysms beyond the reach of thought . . .
And next, I know that I can fall no more,
And consciousness returns in dreadful dreams. . . .
This is the gate of Hell, the innermost;
The gate whence issue all the fiends of hate
To goad the world to madness. Here enslimed
I lie amid shed foulnesses of souls
Cast out as base beyond Hell’s tolerance,
Unfit for clean damnation. All vile things—
The ooze of age on age of foetid crime
And treachery—besmear me on all sides.
To right, to left, behind, before, above,
Swart grinning devils mock me as I lie.
Slow-crawling things, all shapeless and all vague>
Peer from within, and, sidling forth, appal
My very blood with horror of their touch ;
An agony of fear takes hold of me.
Could I but die !—the sweetness of that thought,
The hopelessness, the dread ! There is no death !
No sound of footfall beats upon mine ear,
No blessed murmuring of articulate speech.
There is no light, save for a loathsome glow
Like phosphorus on dead flesh. The pulseless
air
Is unimaginably still, and seeped
In a most bitter silence. So remote
Is honest life beneath the open sky
That I detach myself inexplicably
From that pale clay called Me, and look upon it,
Contemptuous and half pitiful. It lies
All huddled in distortion of affright,
All scarred and seared where squalid needless sins
Have marked their passage in the wasted years.
My glance—so keen these new-found eyes of
mine !
My glance strikes through and through that
sordid clay
And weighs its worth remorselessly, until
The very devils seem to pity it.
I see great powers worn out by slow abuse
To utter impotence ; and every small
Faint latent possibility of good
Decoyed and dead, and etiolate and done—
Atrophy following on desuetude.
I see the heart—-a shrivelled, useless thing
Callous and cold, that once was eloquent,
The very fount and minister of joy,
Imperial with high hopes. I see the brain—
A mass of sorry lumber inchoate—
The brain that once was clean, well-ordered as
The coming of the morning. And I cry,
Facing the horror of this huddled thing,
This sentient carrion that is Me. “ Alas !
Could I but for a day have back Myself ! ”
While all Hell laughs at that insanity,
And fearful forms spring forth from out the
gloom
And crush me back to personality.
And so through an eternity of pain
And nausea that holds me back from death
I lie amid the ooze; while mis-shaped ghouls—
Hell’s scavengers—spit on me as they pass,
And souls, inborne to taste the cleansing of
The searching fires, turn from me with sick looks
Of utter loathing. And the meaner sins—
The grey and ghastly sins that will not burn —
Flung from the gate, fall on me, ’till it seems
That I (so weak and helpless and afraid !)
Bear all the sins of all the sinful world.
Oh, for a breath of air ! a single draught
Of fair, pellucid water ! Oh, to be
For just one moment on some wind-swept height
Above the sea, beneath the blessed sun !
I strive for utterance, but my lips are mute ;
To rise, but not a single nerve responds
To bid my muscles to their offices. . . .
And all the while the devils grin, and glare
With baleful eyes upon my misery.
And at that pass I wake. . . .
Awake ! dear God !
Awake ! The quiet stars peep in at me;
The wind of Night sweeps by and whispers low
The message of her solace. Presently
A distant bell proclaims the measured hour,
Puncturing the air with sweetness, and the peal
Shreds softly into filmy wisps of sound
That sigh themselves to silence.
But the dark,
Warm room oppresses me. I rise and light
The candles swiftly, and in their glow hug
A new strange sense of comfort exquisite.
I raise the blind sand fling the windows wide,
And draw the chill keen air into my lungs.
Who cares for sleep?—the East is purpling with
The promise of the morning and the day !
TASMANIA.
FRANK MORTON.
Imperialism and Democracy.
UNDER the mis-guidanceof Mr. Barton, the
Australian Commonwealth is at present
not only out-Englanding England in
English Imperialism, but is also setting
up a pinch-beck Imperialism of its own. The
acquisition of New Guinea, a step open to the
most serious question, has been quickly followed
by an interference in the New Hebrides, about the
mischief of which there can be no question at all.
There is a fictitious air of grand statesmanship
about such extra-territorial enterprise, the shoddy
idea of greatness which in private life leads many
- a man to subject his wife and family to miserable
penury at home so that he may “ cut p dash ” out-
side. So they are very tempting to a certain type
of mind. And, unhappily, they are of that class
of mischief which it isimmeasurablymoreeasyto do
than to undo. It is a simple matter “to take over”
New Guinea ; to get rid of it honestly and honor-
ably would be a task of quite different magnitude.
It is a simple thing—even a drunken man might
do it to decide that it is Australia’s duty to
actively interfere in the New Hebrides to coun-
teract French influence and to help to “redden”
the Islands. To withdraw from the enterprise
when our fingers begin to get uncomfortably hot
—that is quite another matter.
There is pressing need for a choice—a prompt
choice, seeing how difficult to be revoked is every
step forward to Imperialism—on the part of the
Australian people, between Imperialism and
Democracy ; Power and Liberty. Will the deci-
sion echo that of the goddess who typified wisdom
and declare
Yet not Power
—For Power of itself comes uncalled for—
But to act rightly, upholding the law we live by,
And because right is right to follow right
Were Wisdom— in scorn of consequence,
or will it declare for dominion rather than rightly-
acting democracy ? A decision must be come
to, and must be no vague ill-defined compro-
mise, but a resolute choice —Imperialism or
Democracy.
The two have never in the world’s history co-
existed ; in the nature of things are mutually
antagonistic. The pursuit of Power involves the
abandonment of the pursuit of Liberty, thougli
Power, in as much measure as it is needed fora
free people, “comes uncalled for”—pow.er to pre-
serve their freedom and to resist oppression.
The discussion of the value of a policy of Im-
perialism is generally obscured by the fallacy that
“ Empire ”is synonomous with “greatness and
a devotion to one’s own country arid one’s own
liberty without any desire to rob a neighbour of
his, with contemptible national aspirations. The
man who in England is prepared to shed the
blood of every nigger on earth to extend the
area of British possessions is a patriot; the man
who would put some check of conscience on inter-
national rapine, and who dares to suggest that
England has after all a very fair heritage at
present and might devote attention to improving
rather than extending her possessions; is a “ Little
Englander.” In Australia he is ail: absolute
traitor, and earns the contempt of every true
alderman. Yet, there could be no premise more
ridiculously and utterly wrong than that greatness
depends upon territory and population. In the
boundaries of ancient Greece, a country of about
the size of Tasmania, were settled at one time, the
Athenians, Spartans, Corinthians and half-a-dozen
other peoples, all of the one Hellenic stock, but all
absolutely independent of one another. No one
of these peoples at their prime probably counted
more than 1,000,000 souls. The land they inhabi-
ted was rocky and poorly blessed with rain. All
of the elements of greatness which the modern
Jingo regards as essential seemed to be denied
to them. Yet none can question the glory
of Athens, the greatness Of Sparta, the
magnificence of Corinth. Athens, in particular—
what great Empire, Persian, Egyptian, Baby-
lonian, Mohammedan, Spanish, English, has ever
rivalled the glory of that tiny little people,
dwelling on a rocky atom of the earth, in any one
of the elements of greatness—even in military
and naval prowess? In more modern days, Flor-
ence, the Netherlands, England in the days of
Elizabeth, prove that in no respect does greatness
depend on acres or national eminence on wide
dominion.
Even if a nation’s work is considered to be the
pursuit of military greatness, to the neglect of all
else, the object is sought but indifferently through
Imperialism. The pursuit and attainment of a
wide Empire brings a momentary flare of glory,
then the flame flickers, is puffed o,ut before the
sturdy breath of some little nation holding with
tenacious patriotism its poor acres, and there is
left but dust, the dust which carries down no
message to posterity, the dust which has
enveloped the once most mighty Spanish Empire,
and all the other great military Empires.
But if the argument is narrowed down to the
issue as between Imperialism- and a people’s free-
dom, happiness and true greatness—then the deci-
sion against Imperialism as a policy is open t/j abso-
lutely no question. There may be some hesitation
in accepting as a fact—what is nevertheless true—
that the small people who have attended to the
culture of their own liberties rather than to the
destruction of the liberties of others, have won
more “glory” than the great Empires : there
can be no shadow of a doubt that they have won
more happiness lor themselves, have contributed
more to the sum of that experience which makes
for the higher evolution of the human race. It
follows, as a matter of cause'and effect, that the
governing people of an extending empire cannot
worship at the shrine of Liberty. Empires are
extended over' the ruins of other people’s
rights, and oppression has always this
quality that it is as evil for the oppres-
sor as for the oppressed. The slave revenges
his injuries by degrading his master, and a people
held in bondage condemns its enslavers to a loss
of their liberties. A democracy, Napoleon said,
is a bad fighting government. He was right as
regards its fighting for the extension of Empire,
wrong if he intended to say that a democracy was
weak to-defend itself. Athens, where the purest
of democracy prevailed, overthrew the Persians at
Salamis and Marathon. Switzerland, a tiny
little Republic, has for centuries held its liberty
inviolate against the fierce assaults of most power-
ful nations. France herself, when Liberty had
degenerated into almost anarchy after the Revo-
lution, was yet able to hold all Europe at bay with
her armies. And how the Boers have fought, this
century, let English generals tell. A free people
can fight to protect its own liberties, but a free
people can never fight to destroy another people’s
liberties and remain free. It murders its own
freedom when it sends to the scaffold that of
another nation.
What, then, is to be the ideal of Australia?
The cultivation here of a free white race, jealous
of its own freedom, respecting that of others;
ready to defend its territory against an invader,
just as resolute not to invade another people’s
land ; seeking ever to perfect its system of govern-
ment and the condition of its people, anxious
never to impose upon unwilling others the burden
of its rule ? Or the fostering of au Imperial clan,
as lackey to another Empire, eager always for
foreign aggression and foreign rapine, sacrificing
Liberty so that it may be a better fighting force,
more obedient to discipline and more ruthless in
enterprise ? We are near to the parting of
the ways, one of which runs towards Imperialism,
the other towards Democracy. A dishonorable and
evanescent “glory” may be met with on the
former path (though certainly not at its end): a
real greatness can be the goal of the latter ; for
A g’-e/i.t city is that which has the greatest men and
women,
If it he a few ragged huts it is still the greatest city in
the whole world.
The place where a great city stands is not the place of
stretch’d wharves,' docks, manufactures, deposits of
produce merely,
Nor the place of ceaseless salutes of new-comers' or the
anchor-lifters of the departing,
Nor the place of the tallest or costliest buildings or shops
selling goods from the rest of the earth,
Nor the place of the best libraries and schools, nor the
place where money is plentiest,
Nor the place of the most numerous population.
Where the city stands with the brawniest breed of orators
and bards,
Where the city stands that is beloV’d by these, and loves
them in return and understands them,
Where no monuments exist to heroes but in the common
words and deeds,
Where thrift is in its place, and prudence is in its place,
Where the men and women think lightly of the laws,
Where the slaves ceases, and the master of slaves ceases,
Where the populace rise at once against the never-ending
audacity of elected persons,
Where fierce men and women pour forth, as the sea to
the whistle of death pours its sweeping and unript
waves,
Where outside authority enters always after the prece-
dence of inside authority, -
Where the citizen is always the head and ideal, and
President, Mayor, Governor, and what not, are agents
for pay,
Where'children are taught to be laws themselves, and to
depend on themselves,
Where equanimity is illustrated in affairs,
Where speculations on the soul are encouraged,
Where women walk in "■public processions in the streets
the same as the men,
Where they enter the public assembly and take places
the same as the men,
Where the city of the faithfullest friends stands,
Where the city of the cleanliness of the sexes stands,
Where the city of the healthiest fathers stands,
Where the city of the best-bodied mothers stands,
There the great city stands.

England’s Intellect and England’s
War.
IN the cold, dry light of history the present
S’African war will be classed as the war of
the English plutocracy, of the German-.Tew
gang, the Yankee gang, and the home-
grown-millionaire gang, who control most London
newspapers, and the Chamberlain Cabinet. The
heart of England and the brain of England has
been against the war from the beginning even
unto to the end. Study the list of great English
“pro-Boers” (all who are not pure English
excluded—no green In any of these eyes)
John Buskin, philosopher, prose-poet, artist ;
the most charming sentimentalist of any age.
Herbert Spencer, philosopher, scientist ; the
most absolute and cold-blooded of political
economists.
George Meredith, the one supremely great
English novelist of the day, who this year has come
from his solitude to protest against the barbarity
of Ketchetierismjind Chamberlainism. He writes:
We are but steeling the remainder of their fighting men
to more desperate resistance—a spectacle forebodingly
piteous. It signifies also the further waste of our own
precious blood.
In dealing with the Boer, having the hope to conciliate
him, we must take his version of humaneness, or we shall
find that we have been guilty of bad policy, the most
exacting of a nation’s creditors.
Frederic Harrison, “the great Positivist,”
scientist, philosopher, man of letters.
John Morley, historian and statesman.
Goldwin Smith and James Bryce, the two lead-
ing representatives of English University life.
Not necessary to stretch out the list to include
Field-Marshal Chamberlain, Lord Coleridge, the
Bishops of Hereford and Worcester, and so on.
It is the foremost philosophers, writers, thinkers
of-England that are to be put in the witness-box
this time. Against those named, whom can Mr.
Chamberlain cite? If England to her own self—
herself as represented by her best thinkers—had
only been, true !

Arthur Symons, the personal, the intimate,
arrives in a new two-volume dress —Poems by
Arthur Symons. The five books from Days and
Nights to Images are here collected, with many
omissions and alterations. And a new book
is added —The Loom of Dreams —from which :
THE ONE DESIRE
If I think of your soul, I see
Your body’s be uity ; and then
I pray to your body again,
And your soul answers me.
So to possess you whole,
Two-fold ever the.same,
Come to me light or flame,
Come to me body or soul !

Neatly put by a French-critic : “The French
novelist makes us desire to be in love ; the English
makes us desire to be married.”
Sub-Librarian Brazier puts out a booklet on the
“ Genius of Marcus Clarke.” He is the successor
of Marcus at the Public Library, and gives this as
his qualification partly, also being President of
the Australian Literature Society. Not having
known Clarke, Brazier undertakes an instructive
construction of his personality from his writings.
It may well lead a reader to despair of all his-
torical portraits, except by acquaintances. Clarke
rises ethereal, like Venus from the foam of the
ocean. There are about 40 men who knew Marcus
pretty well, and such of them as have noticed the
incense from this Brazier enjoy a good laugh. It
is, indeed, the kind of thing that is apt to produce
too much reaction. More than justice has been
done to Clarke already.

There are some confident girls in Maoriland, as
the issue of the Atom Quarterly shows. It is a
32-page mag. well-printed, just no\y very girly,
and proper, and prim, but holding out hopes of
one day being well-written, too. The art of
the Atom is ghastly. There is some writing
talent on the staff, but it expends itself mainly
in gush. The Atom, in fact, lacks pepper.

Some correspondents—
W. M. Whitney (in answer to “ G.H.,” 29/3/’O2) : I must
confess my ignorance ; I never heard of (<he poet Burgess.
Hence, any charge of plagiarism is clearly absurd. I
could help your correspondent to a few coincidences
infinitely more startling than those quoted from my
published work. [Here follow some scores of quotations
from Pope-Milton, Chuiohill-Oowper, Spenser-Cervantes,
Coleridge - Herbert-Puller, Defoe -Drupimond- Herbert,
Pope-Cowley and so on, for which we haven’t spat*.
Some of them are of not much use as arguments, e.g. , this
quoted coincidence :
Spenser : The noblest mind the best contentment has.
Cervantes: Whtn one is contented there is no more to
be desired.
That thought is so obvious that it might be said by a
million people independently. However W. M. Whitney
is acquitted, on his word that he hadn't rpad Burgess.]...

Some Cures Effected h Warner's Safe Cure.
The curative properties of Warner’s Safe Cure are -so well known that it is only necessary for
anyone to make inquiry for them to hear from the lips of those whom they know many instances of
the healing virtue of this remarkable medicine. ,
Warner’s Safe Cure acts scientifically. It exercises a specific action upon the liver and kidneys,
restoring them to health and activity. When the kidneys and liver are properly performing their
appointed task of extracting the urinary and biliary poisons, all diseases arising from the presence of
these poisons in the system are overcome, and the cure effected is radical because it is natural.
The common diseases caused by the presence of urinary and biliary poisons in the system are :
Rheumatism Indigestion
Gout Dyspepsia
Neuralgia Biliousness
Lumbago Sick Headache
Backache General Debility
Sciatica Gravel and Stone
Blood Disorders Bladder Diseases
Anaemia Bright’s Disease
For the reason stated, Warner’s Safe Cure has complete mastery over all these diseases. The
following typical letters are worth reading.
Kidney Disease Cured.
Post Office Hotel, Maryborough, Q.,
Nov. 3, 1900.
Hear Sirs,—l have much pleasure indeed in forwarding
the following testimonial as to the marvellous curative
properties of Warner’s Safe Cure, and you are at liberty
to use it in any way you think fit. ,
I may state briefly that I was a sufferer from chronic
Kidney Disease, which made my life perfectly unbear-
able- It is needless to say that I tried the best available
doctors both in England and Australia, with but one
result—absolute failure. I also tried different proprietary
medicines, but with no beneficial results. During this
time you can well understand the pain and misery I
endured—to say nothing of the expense. I was staying
with a professional friend, and related my trouble to him.
He suggested Warner’s Safe Cure. I ridiculed the idea,
telling him I was heartily sick of both doctors and medi-
cine The symptoms gradually became worse, the pain
more intense, and, in a fit of desperation, I despatched
my-assistant for a bottle of your invaluable remedy,
although expecting no better results from it than from
other medicines I had used. Thank God for that bottle.
It was but the forerunner of my complete cure. I used
half a dozen bottles, and my cure was perfect as
well as marvellous. I have recommended the medicine to
a number of friends, and they are not slow to endorse
what I have written. Hoping, sirs, that your remedy
will be extensively used in similar cases to my own, and
wishing you every success and prosperity, I remain,
Yours sincerely,
L. 0. Snowdon,
Surgeon Dentist.

Indigestion Cured.
ii McCormick Street, Port Melbourne, Vic.,
August 24, 1900’.
g t-( —Having been a sufferer for a long time from :
Indigestion and Heartburn I was advised to give War-
ner’s Safe Cure a trial. I did so, and it has completely
cured me I want to recommend it to fellow sufferers,
knowing that it would do them a vast amount of good.
You can make any use of this letter you may wish to, as
I am grateful for the cure.
I remain,
Patrick McGrath.
Messrs. H. H. Warner & 00., Limited.
Barcaldine, Queensland,
November 5, 1900.
Dear Sirs,—l suffered severely from Indigestion, which
caused great pain in my chest and between the shoulders.
After passing several sleepless nights I determined to try
Warner’s Safe Cure, and am now pleased to say that the
pains have entirely left me.
Yours faithfully,
Reginald Parnell.

Liver Disease Cured.
Manchester Street, Christchurch, N.Z.,
March 28, 1900.
Dear Sirs, —For many months I suffered trom Liver
Complaint, which caused me the greatest agony. I tried
various remedies, but they did me no good. Finally, I
was persuaded to give your valuable Warner’s Safe Cure
a trial, and was surprised at the relief from pain and the
benefit I received.
Yours faithfully,
A. J. Standby,
Wool Classer.
To the Proprietors of Warner’s Safe Cure, Melbourne.
Bourke Street, Surry Hills, Sydney,
September 18,1899.
Dear Sirs, —
For years I was a martyr to Liver and Kidney Com-
plaint until I tried Warner’s Safe Cure, when I obtained
fa most beneficial result. In fact, after taking a few
' bottles I seemed a new woman.

Biliousness Cured.
73 Queen Street, Auckland, N.Z.
April 20,1901.
Gentlemen, —
I can certify with pleasure as to the merits of Warner’s
Safe Cure. I suffered a great deal from Biliousness and
pains in the back until, upon strong recommendation, I
used this medicine. The result was that after taking four
bottles of Warner’s Safe Cure and two vials of Safe Pills, I
became as well as ever I was in my life, and I have had no
return of the complaint since.
Yours truly,
W. Southorn.

Bciatica Cured.
Wood’s Siding, Railway Station,
South Brunswick, Vic.,
January 18,1900.
Dear Sirs, —It is now nearly nine years since I was sud-
denly attacked with Sciatica in the back and hips. I
suffered excruciating pain, and was unable to dress my-
self or move about the house. I lost flesh until I was like
a skeleton. I was under the charge of a doctor for a long
while, but he could give me no relief. At last he gave
me up, saying mine was a hopeless case. I was in despair
when a friend advised me to take Warner’s Safe Cure and
Warner’s Safe Rheumatic Cure, alternately, as well as
Warner’s Safe Pills. I was sceptical, but being strongly
urged I gave the medicines a trial. At first I got no
relief, but my wife persuaded me to persevere. After the
second bottle, to my great joy, the pains disappeared like
magic. I improved rapidly. My strength and appetite
increased, and I was able to sleep soundly, which I had
not done for months. I was quite a new man. I took in
all six bottles of the medicines and two bottles of pills,
and was completely cured.
Yours truly,
F. Miller.
Messrs. H. H. Warner & Co., Limited, Melbourne.
Rhematism Cured.
Addington, Christchurch, N.Z.
Dear Sirs, —For many years I was suffering with Rheu-
matic pains all over my body, hands, and feet, and often-
times I was unable to walk across the room without the
aid of table or chair to lean on. My hands and arms were
very much swollen, as if with dropsy. I consulted a
physician, who said I would have to give up work and
take a long rest. He prescribed for me, and gave me
medicines, which gave me a little ease, but failed to cure
me. I was getting as bad as ever, when I was advised to
try Warner’s Safe Cure. lat once purchased a bottle of
the medicine and commenced its use. In a very short
time I began to improve, getting better and stronger,
and the pains less severe. I continued its use a while
longer, when the pains all left me, and all symptoms of
dropsy disappeared. For the last twelve months I have
been in splendid health. lam fully convinced that my
cure is permanent.

Neuralgia. Cured.
81 Brougham Street, Kew, Vic.,
December 27,1900.
Dear Sirs, —I can safely recommend Warner’s Safe Cure
to anyone suffering from Neuralgic pains, as I have used
this medicine myself for Neuralgia. I took two bottles
with immediate good results.
Yours faithfully,
E. H. Thompson.

Gravel Cured.
Lilydale, Victoria,
February 23, 1900.
Dear Sira, —It has long been my intention to send you
a few lines in reference to my cure by the use of Warner’s
Safe Cure. I now do so, and trust that by this means
other sufferers will obtain relief.
Some eight years ago I was seized with severe pain in
my left side, which continued to get worse until I could
bear it no longer, and consulted a doctor. He said I was
suffering from Gravel, and prescribed for me. The
medicine he gave me did not ease the pain in the least.
Someone then advised me to try Warner’s Safe Cure, and
I did so. The first few doses gave me ease. I continued
to take the medicine, and have since had no return of the
complaint.
W. V. Daniels,
Butcher.

Stone in Bladder Cured.
8 Victoria Street, Paddington, N.S.W.,
July 28, 1900.
Some five years ago I was under medical treatment for
severe pains in the back ; in fact, I was completely done
up. The doctor who attended me wanted me to undergo
an operation by crushing a stone in my bladder, but I
did not like the idea, although the pain I was suffering
was severe.
A friend who came to see me advised me to try Warner’s
Safe Cure. I did, and after taking some three or four
bottles I began to feel better. I continued the course for
about five months, and, thanks to this medicine, I became
free from any trouble whatever.
T. J. Oastner.

Kidney and Bladder Disease Cured.
William Street, Darlinghurst, Sydney,
May 26, 1899.
Sirs, —This is to certify that I have suffered from a very
bad condition of my kidneys and bladder. I tried all
sorts of medicines, but got no relief until a friend told me
to take Warner’s Safe Cure. I did so, and after taking
five or six bottles was completely cured. I am now well
and strong, and able to go about my household duties.
I am, yours truly,
Mrs. Ryan.
To Messrs. H. H. Warner & Co., Limited, Melbourne.
Hornsby Street, Maldon, Vic.,
December 9,1899.
It gives me very great pleasure to be able to testify as
to the excellence of Warner’s Safe Cure. I have found
nothing equal to it for Kidney and Bladder Complaint,
from which I suffered. I have never been better in my
life than I am now.
George Aust,
Storekeeper (late of Searsdale).

Headache and Loin Pains Cured
Doncaster Hotel, Harden, N.S.W.
June 15,1901.
Dear Sirs, —
For about three years I was a constant sufferer from
bad headaches and severe pains across the loins.
On the advice of a fellow-traveller I gave Warner’s Safe
Cure a trial, with the result that after taking three
bottles I was completely restored to health.
Yours truly,

The Vagaries of a Torpid Liver.
A Useful Lesson for Sufferer.
The Case of tyr. J. DEGNAN*
(FOR THE “ REDFERN TIMES.”)
Among the most important missions of
inquiry placed on record was that recently
made by our reporter to the home of Mr.
John Degnan, Garden-street, North Botany.
This is due as much to the magnitude of his
discoveries as to the interest of the incident
he elicited on inquiring.
“ Will you favour me with a complete
outline of the vicissitudes you successfully
combated ? ”
“ Right willingly,” answered Mr. Deg-
nan, as he offered the pressman a seat. Five
years went by from the time my illness
started till it was finally conquered, and if
I did not have a bad time it was a caution.
Bear in mind, it was all through the torpid
state of my liver, and, believe me, I got
into such a very wretched condition that I
did not care whether I lived or not. Before
I was really aware what disaster was be-
falling nel used to feel as though I had no
life in me, and was always low-spirited and
sleepy. There was only one thing that I
was lit for, and that was to lie down, but
when I did so I could not sleep, my mind
being actively engaged in going through a
multitude of unhappy thoughts which
seemed to be born of the melancholy condi-
tion I was in. What caused me considerable
uneasiness of mind was that my appetite
became poorer every day, and still more
anxiety was engendered by the knowledge
that what food I did eat was of no benefit
to me, my ability to digest any kind of
eatables having vanished. In this way it
transpired that my strength wasted away
till it was often compulsory for me to knock
off work, although my employment at that
time was not of a heavy description.”
“ How did you feel after your meals? ”
“Just as if I had swallowed so much
lead. Something like a heavy ball seemed
to foim in my stomach, the pains arising
from which were simply horrible, and from
the stomach the heavy sensations travelled
up to my chest, thereby giving me extra-
ordinary difficulty in breathing. My head
ached to a degree which proved almost dis-
tracting, for I could not settle down to
read or do anything, and there was even a
swollen feeling in my eyes to annoy me.
Owing to a pricking sensation under my
shoulder-blades I used to think I had
caught a cold, but experience has taught
me that that was a deranged liver symptom,
while another one, although more torment-
ing in its persistency, was a nasty aching
pain across the loins, which I felt very dis-
tinctly whenfT moving about. The bitter
taste in my mouth was enough to turn any
man off his food, and the dirty coating on
my tongue used to make me feel sick. At
times, when exhausted nature claimed a
few hours’ rest, I fell asleep, but there was
no comfort in doing so, as the ugly diearns
I had simply beggar description. The flesh
gradually fell away from my frame till my
bones were quite visible, and my prospects
were anything but rosy, especially as my
head had long since been troublesome.
Without any ostensible reason it used to
start beating violently against my ribs, the
sound it made being quite loud enough to
lo heard several yards away. It seemed
more than likely that my heart was diseased,
particularly so as those fits of palpitation
were usually accompanied by feelings of
faintness. The woi ry of mind and pain of
body at last succeeded in wearing out my
patience, for it took but little to make me
irritable and excited, after which I sank
into the old gloomy groove of misery till
something else occurred to upset me. Ner-
vousness was not the least of my ailments,
as my nerves twitched involuntarily when-
ever anything happened to disturb me, and
in spite of the medicines I had taken, they
; till trembled at the least provocation.”
“ Where did you eet your medicine from,
Mr. Degnan ?”
“ I refer to the medicines which my
doctors prescribed for me, -but which I
might as well have left untouched for all the
good they were. I was always paying
money away to doctors, and never got any
value back for it; but now if I should
have the ill-luck to fall into bad health
again I would go straight for Clements
Tonic, as I know it to be the best medicine
ever brought within the reach of suffering
humanity.”
“ That being your opinion, why did you
not take some earlier than you did ? ”
“ Recause I had been suffering five years
before I was told about Clements Tonic,
and another reason vas because I had de-
cided against taking any more medicine, as
I thought it was useless. But a relative
came upon the scene and told me how
Clements Tonic had cured his complaints,
which were like mine in nearly eveiy detail;
so I promised to try it, and w hen I did so
it was the best day’s work I ever did, for
Clements Tonic piloted me to health. I
used to dread the very idea of taking any
food, but when I had been on Clements
Tonic a few days it was quite different, ; s I
was always the first to sit down to meals
and the latt one to finish eating, and befo. e
a week was over there was a great reduc-
tion in the severity of my pains in the
stomach. My food did not feiment and
turn to wind as in former years, but it
digested quite readily, and of course I got
the benefit of its nourishment.. The weary
feelings which had darkened my days were
wafted away by the invigorating qualities
of Clements Tonic, which likewise buckled
together my shattered nerves and na le
them firm and true. The greatest s rprise
I ever got in my life was when I discovered
what a splendid medicine Clements Tonic
was for promoting healthful sleep, and I
say ‘ healthful ’ advisedly, for there was no
languidness or depression on awaking, such
as is experienced after taking sleeping
draughts or other such means for producing
slumber. The anxious misgivings which I
had borne in silence when my heart was
given to palpitating were not long in being
dispelled, for Clements Tonic made that
organ beat with the regularity of a clock,
and I can make the same statement in
regard to my inteinal functions generally,
for I never suffered from constipation after
taking a few bottles of Clements Tonic,
which relieved my chest pains and head-
aches very easily. It was pleasant to get
up and notice that my tongue was clean and
that the bitter taste had left my mouth,
but what was still more 1o be appreciated
was the fact that every ache and pain had
deserted my body, which was regaining its
weight from day to day.”
“ Are you sure about the completeness of
your cure? ”
“I am quite positive that Clements Tonic
made a new man of me by giving me better
health and more strength than I ever had
before, Not long ago I was helping to cut a
road through the mountains, about ten milts
from Nowra, and I found that I could do
the heaviest manual labour going without
being unduly fatigued, and, as Clements
Tonic gave me the health to do it, you caii
publish my story in any way you want.”

Cough=Curing
“The Cough was eased almost
immediately-is now completely-
cured ”
Coughs are as common in this sort of
weather as roses in June; all kinds of
coughs from all kinds of reasons, yet all tfie
coughs and all the reasons give way to one
“ 109, Nursery Road, Lozells,
“Birmingham, England,
“ April 9th, 1 901.
“Dear Sirs,— My child suffered from
measles, which left behind a most distressing
couft- I tried several remedies for him,
including an emulsion made by another firm,
but it had not the least effect and did not
relieve the cough one atom. I was then
recommended to try Scott’s Emulsion and
to this end procured a bottle, and from that
time my child commenced to steadily im-
prove. The cough was eased almost imme-
diately, appetite greatly improved, and
vitality and strength increased. I beg to
say my child is now completely cured,
and to Scott’s Emulsion only can I in

justice give the credit of this satisfactory
result. I consider Scott’s Emulsion im-
measurably superior to the other Emulsion
I tried, and its pleasant taste and palata-
bility is a great point in its favour, the child
taking it readily from the first, but it was
only with the greatest difficulty he would
take the other preparation. To show you
how noticeable the improvement must be in
my boy’s condition, I may state our friends
frequently remark upon the change in him
and say how healthy he now looks. —Yours
truly, (Signed) E. Shabratt.” .
“To Scott’s Emulsion only can I in
justice give the credit for this satisfactory
result.” The result Mr. Sharratt alludes to
was the cure of “ a most distressing cough.”
For cough-curing is easy if you know just
what to do. All the coughs of these bitter
winter days will yield to Scott’s Emulsion,
and we have no hesitation in promising
you prompt, almost immediate relief,
with ultimate cure. Is it not the part of
wisdom and comfort to cure the cough you
have?
We are bound to point out to you, not
more in our interest than in your own, that
while curing coughs is easy enough if you
take Scott’s Emulsion, it by no means
follows that you will cure your cough if you
accept anything said to be “ just as good.”
There never can be an imitation just as
good as the original. As for “ substitutes,”
no substitute for the good done by cod-liver
oil has yet been found.
Then, too, after cod-liver oil has refreshed
and reinforced the blood, two other ingre-
dients—blended in Scott’s Emulsion —come
into play, those perfect bone and tissue
builders, hypophosphites of lime and soda.
The three—as combined by our process—
form the perfect treatment for all coughs
from whatever cause arising.
Scotb’s Emulsion, too, is pleasant to taste,
easy to digest, and has—according to an
eminent physician—three times the value
the same quantity of common cod-liver oil.
Remember, therefore, to see that it is Scott’s
Emulsion, on the wrapper of every bottle of
which you will find a picture of a man
carrying a big fish.
You can obtain a sample of Scott’s Emulsion
by sending fourpence to Scott & Bowne, Ltd.,
483 Kent street, Sydney, and mentioning this
paper. All chemists sell Scott’s Emulsion.

For gold he went —God made men so,
All restlessness and striving,
While women sit at home and waib,
And find the whole earth desolate
That erst was gay and thriving.
Oh, my poor boy ! I watched him go
Till in the dimmest distance
He turned and waved his hand to me ;
That winding road my eyes still see
With weariful persistence.
His letters came, and were they gay,
How sore my heart, and jealous !
And were they sad —my tears would flow;
He needed me, who might not go
With comfort swift and zealous.
Amidst the feverous heat and drouth
He worked, and I at leisure ;
Whene’er I felt the south wind blow
My longing thoughts to him would go
Stifling, in search of treasure.
I can no longer weary him.
With eager love’s beseeching.
He lieth still, he will not come
Adown that winding roadway home,
Nor listen to love’s teaching.

Forgive, Forget.
The first kiss after lonely years.
The first kiss and the last —
Like a grey wall the future rose,
Black storm-clouds veiled the past;
He turned to me his searchless eyes,
His lips with ebbing breath —
Was it worth the pain of those severed years—
To kiss at the gates of Death ?
Forgive, forget—Love lingers yet—
Condone the human fault;
Forgiveness is but silence drear
In the darkness of the vault.
Each one of us is frail enoucrh,
Heed what the old love saith,
Lest you kneel to kiss in your agony
By the very gates of Death.

The Thunderstorm.
Her garden sobbed beneath the rushing cloud,
Wild wings fell fluttering in tumultuous bowers,
And through the river gloom of blinding showers,
Swayed the sweet petals of her lilies proud.
And the tall poplar by her window bowed,
Before the passion of the unknown powers
That wrapped her being through those, tranced
hours —
What wonder that her gentle heart was cowed !
Yet, when a wondrous peace suffused again,
With tender light her glistening Paradise,
And song and perfume thrilled to limpid skies.
From bird and flower whose joy was almost pain,
Not theirs the tremulous glory in her eyes
That dreamed of lightning flash and blinding rain.

When Australia Wakes.
When Australia smiles,
When the wizard sunset’s wiles
Work a sweet transfiguration
Over forest, plain, and station.
And the mountain’s dim defiles,
Is there any fairer nation,
When Australia smiles?
When Australia sleeps,
When the moonlight softly steeps
All the city’s ugliness
In her glamour-sweet caresses,
How the glory creeps
O’er the gum-spread wildernesses,
When Australia sleeps !
And what shall be the glory
When Australia .wakes ?
Outdone the Old World’s story
When the new morn breaks !
With eyes worn red with weeping,
We watch the white dawn peeping;
Ah ! who would then be sleeping
When Australia wakes ?
P. F. R.
Surely the world moves when a religious
paper (Australian Churchman) publishes this—
As cleansing the city and suburbs and general sanitary
measures are the order of the day, I wonder if it has ever
been brought to the notice of the many preachers in our
churches, chapels, and meeting-houses of the intolerable
suffocating atmosphere that their congregations have to
endure.
Christianity —perhaps because it was started in
opposition to Judaism, one of the cleanest
religions of all time, and partly, perhaps,
because the wealthy pagans of Rome washed
regularly—became deeply tainted with dirt at the
ou t Set with traditions of saints whose sanctity
mainly depended on not washing, and whose
charity led them to carefully rescue the vermin
which fell from them. Now there is a happy
tendency to get back to Moses and clean, venti-
lated temples.

THE ANCHOR FENCE.
THE ANCHOR FENCE has been pronounced by the leading fence experts as the strongest
fence in the world. It is made with plain or barbed wire, and cannot injure of live stock
nor can the live stock injure it or displace any of the wires, owing to the use of the Anchor Clamp.
Bv means of the Anchor Clamp Pinchers, the Anchor Clamp securely fastens the horizontal and
cross wires, thus consolidating the strength, so that the who<e -fence resists an attack on any
part of it. As the strength of a chain is guaged by the strength of its weakest link, so a fenceis
only as strong as its weakest part—the Anchor Fence is equally strong throughout, and being
constructed wholly of large wires is much stronger than a fence in which small wires are used.
A MARVEL OF STRENGTH AND SIMPLICITY.
“ In replv to vour enquiry, we have just completed the erection of two miles of
Fencing with the Anchor Fence Materials, and have no hesitation in saying that for efficiency,
economy, and promise of durability, it is by far the best fence we have had expenence of, and this
opinion is practically emphasised by our recent order for a further 10 miles. Yours faithfully,

The Alleged Reform Movement.
The political reform movement, which com-
menced in South Australia, broke out again
with extra violence in Victoria, and spread
thence to Tasmania, and which is being
ardently boomed by the Tory press in N.S.
Wales, has a good many of the ear-marks of
a glaring Tory fraud and conspiracy. It is
in Victoria that it has taken most definite
shape, and there it has developed, to a great
extent, into a miserable howl on the part of
a very lightly-taxed community, and es-
pecially the very lightly-taxed property-
holding section of the community, against
paying the necessary price of civilisation; into
an elaborate series of misrepresentations to
bolster up the legend that taxation is unduly
heavy and needs to be reduced ; an organised
attack on the only decent and progressive
branch of the Legislature* disguised as an
attempt to promote public economy by
saving its salary; and a vigorous effort
to bolster up the stagnant and in-
jurious Legislative Council because it is
cheap, so far as drawing no direct remu-
neration is concerned —a characteristic
which it shares with bushrangers, lunatics,
dead bodies, lepers, vagrants, and other
undesirable characters. The programme
outlined by the reform party, at its great
Melbourne conference, has undoubtedly some
good points, but the party doesn’t go far
enough on its good points, and the bad ones
are the most conspicuous. It proposes that
there should be greater economy in State
Government, which is beneficial but exceed-
ingly vague, for it doesn’t show where a
single economy of any size is to be effected.
It demands that money shall only be bor-
rowed for reproductive works, which idea is
an improvement on present practices, but it
doesn’t go nearly far enough ; for there should
be no borrowing at all, either for productive
or unproductive works. And if the proposals
of the conference are adopted, there remains
the fact that an immense number of unpro-
ductive works are absolutely essential in
every civilised community, and when the
conference’s proposal is adopted these must
either be abandoned, which means a relapse
into semi-barbarism, or executed out of
revenue, and the reform party shows
not the least inclination to supply the
necessary revenue. Also, the confer-
ence demands that the miserably-paid
Ministers, who receive about the salary
of a very small bank manager without his
fixity of tenure, shall have their pay reduced ;
and that the ill-paid M.’sL.A., who are
expected to supply the wisdom of Solon for
the wage of a bank-clerk, and pay heavy
election expenses out of this, and sacrifice
probably alife’sprospects for a precarious poli-
tical billet which is often of only three years’
or less duration, shall have their remunera-
tion further cut down. Also, it is proposed
to cut down the dimensions of the Assem-
bly, which proposal is reasonable enough
within certain limits. And it is proposed to
preserve the Legislative Council, whose
hatred of every progressive idea is the
principal reason why the Assembly has very
little useful work to show for its money
—which is the most insane throwing away of
a great opportunity that any “reform”
party was ever guilty of.
Undoubtedly, it is possible to run the
affairs of Victoria, and of the other States,
more economically than at present —the
experience of 1896 and adjacent years proves
that. But it isn’t desirable to return to the
grievous sweating of these hard times merely
to save a gang of selfish Fat men and un-
principled landlords a little taxation. It
would be worth doing it if the loan curse
could thereby be abolished, but that is quite a
different thing. Victoria is the most cheaply-
governed State in the Commonwealth, bar
Tasmania, and both of them are governed a
good deal more cheaply than the United
Kingdom, even in time of peace, though the
average fool person who looks only at exter-
nals never sees this. The regulation attitude
is that of the Tory person who moved the
resolution about “alarming extravagance”
at the Melbourne reform conference, and
who wildly asked his audience to—
Consider that this handful of people were spending
about £7,500,000 a year.
The Victorian expenditure, it is true, as
shown in the public accounts, pans out at
£6 13s. 4d. per head per annum, and when
this is compared with the United Kingdom’s
total expenditure, as shown in a very
differently-arranged system of public ac-
counts, of less than £3 per head per annum,
it looks dreadful enough.
* * • »
But, after all, the difference is in
Victoria’s favor. Its State outlay includes
the cost of running the railways, and
the Britisher pays that also, only with
the difference that he pays it to private
companies, and it doesn’t appear in his
national balance-sheet. But the fact that it
doesn’t appear in that public fashion makes
no alteration in the fact that he does pay it.
Also the cost of maintaining police, charities,
and public education falls on the State
revenue in Victoria—in the United Kingdom
these items are mostly charged to local taxa-
tion, and again they don't appear in the
national balance-sheet, but the citizen pays
them all the same. The relative situations
as regards the amounts actually paid by the
people are about as follows :
Tasmania (year 1900).
Paid in taxes, postal and other revenue .. £680,206
Paid to State railway manager in fares and
freights .. .. .. .. .. 192,561
Paid in local taxation, about.. .. ~ 147,012
£1,019,779
Equal to £5 19s. lid. per head, or if land
revenue (£71,203) is included, the total is
£1,090,982, or £6 Bs. 4d. per head.
Victoria (year to 30th June, 1900).
Paid in taxes, postal and other revenue .. £4,064,614
Paid to State railway managers in fares and
freights .. .. .. .. .. 3,010,795
Paid in local taxation, about.. .. .. 1,185,307
I
£8,260,716
Equal to £6 17s. Bd. per head, or if land
revenue (£375,267) is included, the total is
£8,635,983, or £7 3s. lOd. per head.
United Kingdom (year ended 31st March, 1900—before
the war-taxes were imposed).
Paid in national taxes, postal and other re-
venue .. .. .. .. .. £119,839,905
Paid in local rates, collected by national
Government .. .. .. .. 10,000,381
Paid local taxes direct to local authorities,
about .. .. .. .. .. 60,853,848
Paid to private railway managers in fares and
freights.. .. .. .. .. 98,854,552
£289,548,686
Equal to £7 4s. 9d. per head. And the
Victorian and Tasmanian have, in proportion
to population, five times the railway facilities
that the Britisher enjoys. In Tasmania
there is one mile of railway for every 333
people ; in Victoria, one for 361; in the
United Kingdom, one for 1759 people.
* * * *
In each case water rates have been ex-
cluded. If the amount which London pays
to its private water companies could be
readily ascertained, and water rates were
included all round, it might have made a
slight difference, but the variation is not
likely to be of great importance. The main
fact is that, taking the figures of the last
year, before the war taxes upset all calcula-
tions, the Tasmanian and Victorian were
paying a good deal less than the inhabitant of
the United Kingdom, and grumbling a great
deal more, and getting five times the railway
accommodation. Yet the U.K.*is supposed
to be a not very badly-managed community
on the whole. Certainly Victoria, as far the
poorer country by nature, has no right to
spend as much as the United Kingdom does
—still the ordinary individual who includes
Victoria’s railway receipts as taxation, and
doesn’t include the United Kingdom’s rail-
way receipts as taxation, and who, there-
fore, figures out Victoria as being governed
at nearly £7 per head, as compared with
England’s £3, or less, is just a plain fool,
and a hopeless one at that. Victoria’s paid
Assembly has done better than England’s un-
paid House of Commons, insofar that it runs
the country at a cheaper rate. It has done
worse, insofar that it should have the courage
to tax Victoria up to the British level, which
would mean adding about another £500,000
a year to the public burdens; to save another
£500,000 a year by hard economy, or, if that
is not possible, it should tax above the British
level; and it should construct the State’s rail-
waysand otherpublic works with the proceeds,
thereby making an end of the loan curse for
ever. In other words, the worst foolishness
of the paid Assembly of Victoria is that it
doesn’t tax the sort of people who constitute
the reform movement more heavily for a good
purpose, and its best excuse is that the selfish
and unpatriotic Legislative Council, which
the reform party is so anxious to pre-
serve, wouldn’t allow it to do so if it
tried. If the principal weight of the chari-
table, police and education vote were laid on
the local bodies as in Britain, and the local
taxation on property went up in consequence,
to something like ss. in the £ rental as in
Britain, undoubtedly it would be possible to
obliterate the borrowing curse, and put Vic-
toria’s affairs on a better footing. And if the
Assembly received a mandate from the
people to abolish borrowing, and to make
the public finances clean and respectable,
and the House of 48 Rich Landlords, whose
blatant refusal to tax its own class up to
anything like the British level blocks all
reform, were abolished, its record is good
enough to justify the hope that it might do
the work.
* * * •
Of course, there is no reason why, in
addition to the abolition of the House of
Landlords, the Victorian Assembly should
not be reduced to, say, 60 members. But if
it is reduced, the salaries of Ministers and
individual members should be handsomely
increased. Britain may have a large
leisured class, whose members can give
their services gratis, and it may be
satisfied with the kind of services it
receives from them, but Australia is differ-
ently situated. The kind of politician that it
can get gratis is exemplified in the dull idiocy
of its unpaid Upper Houses. If the country
wants to economise, it should start with
unpaid bank-managers, gratis bosses of in-
surance offices, and honorary Governors,
Chief Justices, and railway commissioners.
If it can’t get men to efficiently fill small
billets like these for nothing, it shouldn’t
expect to get men to do efficiently the much
larger work of managing the whole country
for nothing. The cheapest and most igno-
rant sneer is that Avhich is directed at the
politician because he doesn’t run the country
to absolute perfection for about the wage a
man gets for running a locomotive, and the
proposal to make him more efficient by pay-
ing him less is an equally brilliant inspira-
tion. On this subject here is some of the
reform party’s language :
Mr. E. 0. Warde, M.L.A., said during the last year
Ministers’ salaries amounted to £94oo—(Too much) —
members’ salaries, £25,800—(T00 much ; and laughter)-
the Council and officers, £6275—(G00d boys ; and groans)
—and Assembly officers, £9l44—(groans.) “ Hansard,”
instead of costing £15,000, as stated by the press, cost
only £6670. (Still too much ; and disorder.) The State
reading room had cost £1233 ; refreshment rooms—(ah ;
derisive cheers, and smacking of lips)—£1000, and alto-
gether the total expenditure on Parliament was £66,527.
(Say it all,again ; and derisive cheers.)
It appears from this that it costs a good many
thousands less to run the whole Parliament
of Victoria, even with all its needless frills
and officers, than it costs to run the purely-
local Bank of Victoria. Truly, it looks as if
the State should look for the gratis bank-
manager first and the gratis politician after-
wards.
• • * •
Along with some good features, the alleged
reform movement has, therefore, these in-
curably bad ones : It embodies a persistent
jeer and scoff and curse at the only House
of Stale Legislature which represents
the people and over which the people have
any real control. It jibes at the £3OO a year
M.L.A. because, in some few respects, he
has proved as incompetent as the £2OOO and
£3OOO a year bank managers who made the
appalling smash of ’93. It complains that he
doesn’t manage the country so well as he
might, when almost everything he attempts
is nullified or mutilated by an irresponsible
Upper House, which the “ reform ” party
seeks to preserve. Its policy is, by implica-
tion and indirectly, a glorification of the
Upper House, wherein are gathered so
many of the blindly-incompetent bank and
financial wreckers who nearly made Victoria
insolvent a few years ago, and who fought
against the measures by which George
Turner averted the downfall. Its accusa-
tions about the inordinate cost of running
the country under the Assembly’s manage-
ment are, to a great extent, just plain lies.
Its implication that the Assembly stands in
the way of reform is mostly untrue. The
Victorian Assembly at least passed, by a
small majority, the second reading of the
Bill for the creation of a popular Convention
to draft a new cheap reformed Victorian
constitution, and the Bill was dropped
because the smallness of the majority
encouraged the M’s.L.C. to let it be known
very clearly that they would have none
of it—also because Peacock lacked the
courage of his convictions. If the
reform party devoted itself to getting
the House of Rich Landlords out of the
way, and then gave a mandate to a reduced
(and better paid) Assembly that it required
better financial methods, it would probably
get them, for there would no longer be a
capacious waste-paper basket in the Land-
lords’ Chamber to serve as a grave for good
ideas and projects of reform. Until that
body is shifted there is no possibility of
serious reform, and there is nothing in the
alleged reform party’s programme about
even amending it—let alone shifting it.
* * * *
The alleged “reform” party demands
mainly reduced taxation, which must almost
inevitably mean more borrowing, for though:
Victoria is not run on quite the intensely
economical principles of 1896, it is run—
apart from its ridiculous war expenses—
as cheaply as any civilised country can
be without being a sweater of a very
bad order. Certainly contingents and old-
age pensions have increased the expenditure
since June, 1900, but, even with its old-age
pensions, it is run at a less annual cost per
head than Britain is without old-age pensions.
A lot more taxation—the proceeds to be set
apart exclusively for public works purposes,,
the abolition of borrowing, the abolition of its.
Upper House, the reduction of the salaries
of the Governor and other purely ornamental*
individuals, a smaller and better-paid Minis-
try and Assembly, and the hanging of a few
bogus reformers whose whining about their
very light burdens is a disgrace to the man-
hood of the community, are Victoria’s real!
requirements just now.
Britain’s Poland.
The British Government falls back again* on tlie-
old, stupid, brutal coercion process in* Breland,
and the Crimes Act has been proclaimed! in nine
counties. There is very little crime in. Ireland at
any time—it is, in most years, the most law-abiding
section of the United Kingdom, and, just now the
Chief Secretary admits that there are fewer violent
offences against person or property than at any
previous time on record. Nevertheless, Ireland
is under all manner of extraordinary laws and
repressions; the right of public meeting is almost
wholly suspended ; the inestimable privilege of
free speech is “off”; and all manner of violent
means are being taken to make Ireland love Eng- •
land very much. The Irishman, according to
English ideas, commits three sins that are beyond i
all pardon, and a fourth that is nine times more -
horrible than the other three put together. He ob-
jects to the aggregation of huge estates in the hands ■
of greedy, rack-renting landlords, many of them i
English absentees, in which respect he is just like ■
the democrats of Australia, and wants to follow the ■
policy adopted in S. A. and Maoriland, and strongly ,
approved in other States. He wants Parliamentary
Government of his own in purely local matters,.
and he agitates for it just as all the Australias did I
till they secured it. And he wants, just as Maori-
land, Victoria, S.A. and Canada do, to build I
up his local industries by Protection. These are ■
very small and ordinary demands. Even this;
loyal and Jingo land of Australia would probably
have expressed its feelings by hooting the Duke of
York and throwing road-metal at the Governor if.
they were denied to it. And finally, as the mGstt
hideous crime of all, he is suspected of not having;
the profound affection he should have for the
nation which has made his country the ruin it is.
* • • *
Ireland’s old Parliament voted its own aboli-
tion, not by the votes of the people’s representa-
tives, for in the Irish House of Commons less than
100 out of 300 members were really elected. The
Government, or the peers who had the right of
nomination, simply appointed enough alleged
Irish members, many of them English military
officers, to carry the Union. Ireland was then
more thickly-peopled than England and had
about two-thirds of England’s population, but as
it was allowed less than half its fair share
of representation in the British House of
Commons, it had no voice worth mentioning
in the joint councils of the United Kingdom.
Many of its industries had been ruined by war or
directly abolished and prohibited by the English
Government in the interests of English manufac-
turers. So when the Ereetrade frenzy struck the
country, Ireland’s new manufacturing industries
were too young and feeble to stand the shock of
foreign competition, and died out to a great
extent, while the older and more deeply-rooted
ones of England kept up reasonably well. Eng-
land, with about twice its fair share of Parliamen-
tary representation, decided the new fiscal policy
mostly “on its own,” and wholly in what it:
regarded as its own interests. By confiscation
and other processes the soil of Ireland had mostly
passed into the hands of huge proprietors, a large -
proportion of them absentees. The rents of both
Ireland and England were spent in England, and.
England prospered—lreland didn’t. Ireland,,
with its manufactures blighted by the Ereetrade;
policy, which struck them when they were too;
young to stand the shock, and with hardly any
minerals, became, of necessity, mainly an agri-
cultural country, and even England has found
that its agriculture can’t stand the Ereetrade
policy. And the Anglo-Irish landlord proved a
merciless rack-renter. When the English agri-
cultural landlord became too extortionate his
tenantry left the farms, drifted to the towns and
cities, and became artisans or miners—therefore
there was a close limit to rack-renting in England.
The Irish farmer had no mines and hardly any
city industries to go to, and if he couldn’t raise the
money to leave the country he stayed on his farm
and starved miserably for the benefit of the land-
lord, and his helplessness was the landlord’s oppor-
tunity. His poverty made him ignorant—poverty
and ignorance go together. His farming was bad
because he was too poor to buy implements or
education. His country became the only one in
Europe which was falling into a state of utter
depopulation.
* * * *
And England, in a semi-repentant mood, will
do anything for Ireland except let it build up
its industries again in the way that England
built up its own industries ; or legislate seriously
against the big landholders—the peers and
squires to whom the English mind grovels
so profoundly ; or allow Ireland to manage
the local affairs which England has shown
itself so utterly incapable of managing that it has


only succeeded in wiping out half the population.
A little has certainly been done through the
Government purchasing large estates and cutting
them up for re-sale, but it is very little, and when
the Irishman finds that the Government _ can
afford to buy land at a fair price, and re-sell it at
13s. 4d. per acre per annum—this covering interest
and a portion of the purchase money—he only
realises the more what an iniquity is the average
rental of sometimes double that amount. And
his anger at the Government which can afford him
this relief without loss, and won’t do it on any
large scale because it doesn’t want to compulsorily
buy out the sacred duke and the holy squire, is
very natural.
* * » •
And when the Englishman found that the Irish-
man didn’t love the rack-renting landholder or the
Government which supported him, and that he
was agitating against them, he was shocked
at the other fellow’s iniquity. So the
right of public meeting is, to a large ex-
tent, suspended again to make the Irish-
man feel more affectionate, and extra repres-
sive laws are put in force to promote good feeling,
and even the little that was being done to break up
the large estateshasbeen adjourned. Ireland’s want
of affection for England is still a thing which the
Englishman can’t understand, and when certain
Irish members cheered in the House of Commons
on hearing that a military force belonging to the
people who had wiped out half their nation by
selfish mis-government had been defeated, the
moral sense of England was shocked at the black
ingratitude of it. It was just as shocked as was
schoolmaster Wackford Squeers at the want of
affection shown by his pupils, and it took exactly
the same method to promote better feeling. The
fact that Ireland has lost half its population since
the beginning of the Freetrade era doesn’t prove,
in the Englishman’s view, that England’s system
is a failure ; it is all due to the natural cussedness
of the people—just as the hideous death-roll in
Ketoiiener’s concentration camps only proves
the deep villainy of a race which dies on pur-
pose to bring a kind enemy into discredit.
And the fact that England is not loved by this
large section of the people of its own United
Kingdom is only a further proof that any want of
affection towards it on the part of foreign
nations arises from the natural malignance
of the foreign disposition. Having reasoned
things out this way, the Salisbury Govern-
ment proposes, quite honestly and seriously,
to try another spell of coercion. The
self-complacency which believes that the best part
of a nation has abandoned its country for purely
imaginary grievances, and that there can’t be any-
thing seriously wrong with the policy which has
almost obliterated a race, because it is an English
policy, and that a community can be made to love
its rack-renting landlord by being arrested until
its affection for him becomes manifest, is an in-
teresting study.
The Drudges of the Bush.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Many hearts go out in pity
To the children of the city,
To the young lives maimed and crippled in the
oity’s roar and rush ;
But it isn’t yet the fashion
To waste poems of compassion
On the little white-slave drudges of the much-
belauded bush.
Dragging on from day to day,
With no time for rest or play,
Sad-faced, sad-eyed little drudges are the children
of the bush.
Much we talk of education,
And of building up a nation
Of strong hands and noble hearts, and of the
glories yet to rise.
Schools in plenty are provided,
Where the young minds may be guided
In the pleasant paths of knowledge, in the
wisdom of the wise.
But the little children weep—
“ Give us rest,” they say, “ and sleep,
For we cannot see our primers for the sleep
within our eyes.”
Through the land a voice is wailing,
And in vain deaf ears assailing,
’Tis the sad cry of the children. Brothers, listen
to it now :
“ Have you given us, soul and body,
To the cow, and pig, and ‘ poddy,’
Sold us over into bondage to your gods, the swine
and cow ? .
Have we done ye aught amiss,
That ye bring us forth for this,
Just to give our young lives over to your deity—
the cow?”
Ah, in vain the children’s pleading,
For no ear their cry is heeding;
Out at dawn the young slaves hasten to begin the
toilsome day;
With dull brains where sleep still lingers,
And with aching backs and fingers,
In hot yards they sit and suffer, sit and toil and
tug away.
And the separator moans,
As it grinds the flesh and bones,
Of the little, helpless children, for whom no one
thinks to pray, n
GLENGARRIFP.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
More Concentration “ Bag 1 .”
Last week the cable reported that the death-rate
in the South African concentration camps during
the month of March was 45 per 1000, and if the
cable wasn’t drunk that is equal to 540 people out-
of every 1000 dying per annum—a rate which
would practically extirpate the remaining women
and children of the Boer race inside two years.
If the figures are given correctly, the mortality
beats the worst record of any plague in history, it
beats the prisons of the Inquisition with the
torture-chamber and the auto-da-fe thrown in, and
it is such a stupendous horror that it almost
amounts to proof of an intention to kill off the-
helpless women and infants and thus simplify the
Boer problem by wiping out the race. Of course-
it is quite possible that the cabled figures are-
wrong, but right or wrong this fact remains : All
the large, respectable moral daily papers of this
country published the figures, and accepted them
as true, and not one among them all uttered a <
word of serious comment on its own horror.
Jingoism has apparently killed any semblance of
decency or humanity among its votaries.. Apropos
of the management of the concentration death-
traps, Adelaide Chronicle, which no one suspects
of being a Boer organ, publishes this (19th
April, 1902) from its own correspondent in South
Africa. The lady writes from Bethulie :
The inspector of Burgher camps, Mr. Bowen, has been
here for a fortnight trying to ascertain the cause of the
terrible mortality in Bethulie camp. On his arrival he
at once dismissed the superintendent, who seemed to
have been entirely unfitted for his position. In fact, I
was told that his qualifications for the post consisted in
being a great sportsman, and having been the means of
recovering some officer’s valuable dog, which had been
lost. He was supposed to live in the camp, but spent his
time at the hotel, while the 4000 people under his charge
died by hundreds (1200 in six or seven months). The
over-worked doctors either fell ill and sometimes died
themselves, or resigned their hopeless task. The
camp had every fault possible, Mr. Bowen told
me—overcrowding, tents too near together, and
never moved for months ; bad sanitary arrangements ;
insufficient water supply, and a poor and scanty dietary.
Under his direction the tents are being spread out, so as
to cover a much larger area on new ground, the dietary
is improved, and already the death-rate has lowered.
Epidemics of measles and whooping-cough are respon-
sible for many deaths, but at present debility and
atrophy among the mothers and a sort of marasmus
among the children are what the doctors have to contend
with. Some of the people are really mere skeletons.
“ Only a course of port wine, jelly, and change of air
would be ordered for them,” as the superintendent
quietly remarked to me, “ were they in a position to get
either.” He says he has just obtained from the Govern-
ment permission to allow tinned milk for young children,
which has hitherto not been given except in cases of sick-
ness.
Bethulie, be it noted, is not away far back in the*
disturbed districts. It is on the border of Cape
Colony and on the railway line, right under the
eyes of British authority, and easily accessible for
the supply of provisions and necessaries. Practi-
cally it is in the glare of the limelight, so to speak.
And even there, it appears, nearly one-third of
the prisoners—the women and helpless infants —
were killed off in seven months by starvation and
neglect, and many of the survivors reduced to
mere skeletons, before even so much as an
inquiry was started. The fostering care of the
British Government consisted in appointing, as
officer in charge, a man whose qualification was
that he had recovered a lost dog. Nothing is said
in the report about the ignorance or the unclean-
liness of the Boers being the cause of the frightful
mortality—apparently that lie has fallen through.
The Chronicle’s correspondent adds that typhoid
(essentially a dirt-disease, and, therefore, a fair
evidence of the habits of the people) was quite
unknown in the Orange State before the war.
When Miss Emily Hobiiouse told the awful story
of the concentration camps many months ago, the
only result was a flat denial of her statements, her
prompt exclusion from the country to prevent any
further revelations, and the ejection from the
camps of the Red Cross nurses who were doing
their best to alleviate the hideous mass of human
suffering. Some small attempt at reform only
comes at this late hour, when, with the gradual
pacification and re-settlement of the country, it is
impossible any longer to exclude observers and
keep the great iniquity dark. The concentration
camps of South Africa are the foulest blot
on Britain’s history, and after the brutish
and cold-blooded slaying of women and
children in these places of infamy there
is no room for any further British comment
on the doings of Weyler, the Spanish butcher of
Cuba. As for the occasional reports that have
reached here by cable that the confinees in the
camps expressed their profound gratitude for the
good treatment they have received, and their grief
and indignation at the baseless insinuations to the
contrary—seeing that it was the people who were
responsible for the horrors who sent the alleged
verbal testimonials along, these are just about as
valuable as Weyler’s unsupported assurance that
the Cubans really approved of his methods. As
a kind of finishing touch to the story, by the way,
it is just cabled that the farms of a number of
Boer leaders—not Cape Colony “ rebels,” but
officers of the Orange Free State—have been sold
to pay for the board and lodging of their families
confined in the camps. How much per week is it
proposed to charge each of the living skeletons of
Bethulie for the starvation diet and the services
of the boss, whose qualification was that he
recovered a British officer’s lost dog ? And how
do the skeletons of Bethulie, where there was
sufficient publicity to give a fair chance of some
special care, compare with those in the concen-
tration camps further oack and away from obser-
vation ?

Me the Bushveldt Buccaneers—a Question.
The “ official account ” of the court-martial pro-
ceedings in S’Africa culminating in the execution
of Morant and Handcock is now available. It
is very detailed in its corroboration of the facts we
already possess, but observes a most significant
silence on one point, about which it is the duty of
the Federal Government to demand full par-
ticulars. There were in all jive officers of the
Bushveldt Buccaneers put on trial at the first
court-martial. Three of them were Australians, the
fourth was probably Lieut. Picton, an English
officer. Who was the fifth ? The Bulletin can
answer the question, and give his name, but
prefers that that should come through official
sources. Suffice it to say that he was a
“ political agent ” and that he was represented
as being in the confidence of Ketchener and the
headquarters staff. Now what became of this
English officer? We know what happened to the
Australians concerned—two shot, one imprisoned
for life. As to English officer Picton’s fate we
are also informed; he was not shot or imprisoned,
but “ cashiered.” As to the other English officer,
the captain who was also a political agent and
supposed to have been in the confidence of
Ketchener, about whom there is so marked a
silence? Was he found guilty or not guilty? In
the latter case, was any punishment inflicted upon
him, or was the fact of his close association with
headquarters taken as a sufficient excuse ? The
Bulletin trusts that Mr. Barton will be so far
disobliging to Mr. Chamberlain as to ask for full
information on this point.
♦
The Dying Babies.
There is always room to make a few remarks, in
a strictly moderate tone of voice, on the persistent
refusal of the Australian infant to grow up and be
a man-or a woman, as the case maybe. This
habit of his is more noticeable in Melbourne and
Sydney, chiefly because there are more of him in
these cities, but it is pretty frequent everywhere.
Nearly every day the metropolitan papers report
inquests on at least a couple—often more—of
.small infants who mostly die because they feel
that way. The evidence nearly always shows
improper feeding, want of attention, inherited
disease and so forth, but no jury ever verdicts
murder or manslaughter against the responsible
parties. Wherefore this paper is moved to return
a verdict on its own account, which verdict is one
■of wilful murder against each and every State
■Government. The case against Victoria will
hold good against all the States. The Cabbage
Garden Government was lately told, in almost so
many words, by a coroner named Dickson, that
babies were dying like flies, and unless the
Government moved towards a scientific, general
treatment of unclaimed youngsters their
deaths were at its own door. On April
2nd, at Ballarat, coroner Dickson spoke once
more. He was inquiring into the decease
of an infant boarded out with a nurse, through
whose hands 16 babies had passed in four years,
of which 16 no less than LO had died. The
nurse said she was “going to give up keeping
babies as they were too much trouble.” Mr.
Dickson said he was pleased to hear it, though he
failed to see where the 4 ‘ keeping ” came in. He
also remarked, on learning that the Department’s
dietary scale had not been adhered to, that
departmental regulations were practically a farce,
as nurses dieted infants according to their own
sweet wills, and the only thing that would stop
the slaughter of the children was a properly
managed Foundling Hospital. The lady superin-
tendent of the Victorian Infant Asylum a
Foundling Hospital without the anonymity-
speaks even more strongly. “It is a blot on
humanity,” says she, “ that innocent babies should
suffer for want of ordinary care and attention, and
the sight of wizened, suffering, little creatures
brought daily to our door would cause the
heart to ache with pity for their very help-
lessness. Yet, for lack of accommodation, I am
compelled daily to refuse admission to homeless
infants.” And so they die —like flies. It is a
very shiftless and uneconomical proceeding. The
country is always declaring that it wants popula-
tion, and here is population going to waste. It
costs very little more to rear our own foundling
than to import a full-grown citizen —perhaps when
allowance is made for the saving of the inquest (a
jury of 12 decayed citizens of loose habits at 4s.
each, and a funeral and other items mount up) it
costs less. There was a time when this country
could disregard trifles like these ; it can’t now.
During the last ten years the six States of the
Commonwealth only gained some 8000 people by
excess of arrivals over departures—this despite the
attractions of the Westralian gold boom ; and as
things were less promising in the latter part of the
decade than the early part, next ten years may be
worse. This isn’t a time for a promiscuous
dropping of infants.

The “Herald’s” Policy of Stousli.
Sydney Morning Herald, which has an old-
established reputation for ignorant illiberality, is
doing its best to push the Senate of Sydney Uni-
versity into “ dealing with ” Professor Wood, for
his open expression of anti-war opinions, after the
fashion that a band of larrikins deals with a
dissentient, by “stoush.” The Herald, for all
its dull respectability, has always had a trace
about it of the Cabbage-tree Mob, which was the
first of Sydney’s “pushes”; and that influence
shows strongly just now. An article from Mr.
Wood’s pen in Manchester Guardian is the cause
of the Herald’s present irritation, an article
which, judging by its cabled summary, seems to
have stated some plain truths as to Australian
opinion on the Boer war. In protesting against
those truths the Herald manages to tell, and sug-
gest some half, and more than half, falsehoods:—
What Mr. Wood may think or say or do is of little con-
cern to the public, and if he chooses to join the loud
minority on this question that is a matter for his own
consideration. But we have a distinct interest in what
the Professor of History allows himself to say and write,
especially after the censure of him by his own Senate in
a similar case. He is practically a civil servant, and he is
employed in a State which wisely prohibits its servants
from faking an active part in politics.
Professor Wood is not a civil servant in any sense
of the word. And it is not conceivable that Mr.
Wood signed an article or letter to tne Manchester
Guardian as “ Professor Wood ” (though such a
vulgarity mignt seem natural enough in the
Herald office). The article, it may be quite
safely presumed, was signed “G. A. Wood,” as
was a recent one to Sydney D.T. regarding
that other terrible pro-Boer, Field-Marshal
Chamberlain. What Sydney University Senate
intends to do in response to the Herald
article we can’t say; but its recent reproof of Mr.
Wood suggests that it is in need of a kindly word
of warning not to make an absolute ass of itself.
Oxford University has just appointed as Regius
Professor of History a much more extreme “pro-
Boer ” than Mr. Wood (the distinguished Mr.
Bryce, to wit), and throughout England there
are bishops, generals, professors, naval officers and
big civil service officials who hold and declare
publicly the same views as does Mr. Wood. There
is no suggestion in England about sacking them—
not even the military officials. And surely Sydney
can afford to be as liberal as England. After all,
the city is a very small pumpkin patch in an inter-
national sense, and the actions of its University
and the attitude of its papers don’t attract very
much attention in St. Petersburg, or Berlin, or in
De Wet’s last camp. If Sydney University
Senate rushes to save the empire from tottering,
by acting on the advice of the Herald and the
News, and breaking its agreement with Professor
Wood, it will only (in addition probably to
suffering a financial penalty for the breach) figure
as a fool in the face of England. The civil service
argument (even if Mr. Wood were a civil servant,
which he is not) is silly bigotry, in view of the
fact that the civil servant who approves of the
war is allowed to call out for blood at the top of
his voice. And the demand that a Professor of
History must not write or talk about current
history, unless his remarks suit the views of a
number of persons who know little or nothing
of history, is a humorous item.

More American Encroachment,
Mr. Reid said that he and his party believed in manu-
factures, but not in coddling them at the general expense.
They believed in their manufactures working fairly and
honestly at what they could produce. If Protection was
a good thing for labor, why should it not be extended to
the bush laborer, the hand on the farm and to the
boundary rider? If this policy were good it must be ex-
tended away from the cities to the country. (Hear, hear.)
And if it were a bad policy it should be abolished. Only
two days ago the protectionist organ noted with satis-
faction the fact that in 10 years America exported
£540,000,000 worth more goods than she imported. One
could expect that this excess of goods must have been
paid for in coin, or else where had the goods gone ?
Mr. Crouch (Vic.) : Gone to pay the interest on the
debts.
One of the great griefs of the Foreign-trader is the
fact that the United States, under its Protec-
tionist policy, has become, not only the richest
country in the world, and the greatest manufac-
turing country in the world, but also the greatest
exporting country in the world. Last year its ex-
ports exceeded its imports by over £116,000,000, and
they have shown a large excess for many years,
except in the occasional disastrous periods when
the U.S. relapsed into a semi-Freetrade policy,
and was very sorry for it afterwards. With the
surplus the Republic first paid off its foreign
debts, public and private. Then it reached out
for the position of the world’s money-
lender, which Britain used to hold, and
within the last few years it has lent
many millions to Scandinavia, Russia, and
even to the British Government, a con-
siderable proportion of the recent British war-
loans having been subscribed in the United
States. It has bought up most of the British
match-industry, a large part of the British tobacco-
manufacturing industry, and enormous masses
of securities of various kinds. One of the
London city railways is reputed to be almost
wholly owned in America. It recently purchased
a large English shipping co. And now the cable
reports that the principal British fleets trad-
ing in the Atlantic—representing, it is said,
“five-eighths of the cream of British ship-
ping”—have been formed into a big trust
or pool or combine, and that the whole
affair will, in future, be under American manage-
ment, and there is a cry of dismay in England
to the effect that the mercantile supremacy at sea,
which the United Kingdom has held for 42 years,
threatens to wither in a night. Away back in the
middle of last century the United States, which
had been a growing marine power for years, over-
took Britain and became the greatest ship-owning
and sea-carrying Power in this world. It was
growing with such velocity in those days that it
bade fair to build up a mercantile marine that
would outnumber that of all Europe, but—the
great Civil War came, its shipping; was sunk,
burned, Blown up and practically wiped off the
face_ of the sea, and by pure accident Britain’s
marine supremacy was restored. But though the
first notable event of the Freetrade era was the
loss of Britain’s commercial supremacy on the
sea, and it was mere accident that prevented the
loss being a permanent one, hardly anyone re-
members that episode. The general impression
is that that supremacy hasn’t been challenged
for ages, and that it is an unthinkable thing
that it should be challenged, while the idea
of it being lost is treason and insanity.
Yet it is being lost. In 1900, the British
shipping going in and out of the ports of the
United Kingdom was 2,428,931 tons less than in
1897 ; the foreign shipping in British ports was
10,115,478 tons more. Between these years there
was a slow decline by the weary process of attri-
tion. The hurried Yankee, with his billions and
his velocity, now conceives the idea of buying up
the British mercantile marine in one lot, and,
though he hasn’t succeeded, he seems, judging
from the alarm that prevails in England, to have
got control of a considerable proportion of it,
even if the old flag is still left flying as a matter of
form. And silly little Freetraders like George
Reid still inquire what becomes of the surplus
exports of the great Protectionist Republic, and
suggest that they doubtless go to pay interest on
its outside debts. With that surplus the Republic
is buying up the earth before their eyes, and the
Freetrade nation, and the Freetrade joss, and the
Freetrade theory that the secret of national great-
ness lies in lots of cheap imports, are gravitating
to an obscure place on the back seats of history.

Un-Australian.
General Hutton’s promulgated war scheme does
not come up to the high Jingo expectations
aroused by his BARTON-approved speech, when he
proposed to form one army for home and one army
for foreign service. Nevertheless it contains a
good deal of that monstrous proposal, wrapped up
in euphemistic words. If he can’t get all that he
wants directly, General Hutton is willing to get
some of it indirectly. What else was to be expected
of him ? He is a purely British person, and his
only Australian sentiments and feelings centre
round bis fat Australian salary. Hutton can no
more be expected to frame an Australian military
policy than could a French general. His scheme
is thoroughly un-Australian, and devised for pro-
tectingßritish interests only. True, he has invented
a pretty name for his disloyal work —disloyal in the
sense that it is inimical to the country which
he has undertaken to serve in return for that
country’s good cash—but that doesn’t change its
character. General Hutton says
Two factors may be considered as governing the future
organisation and administration of the military forces of
the Commonwealth—namely (a), the defence of Aus-
tralian soil; (b), the defence of Australian interests
wherever they may be threatened.
The defence of Australian interests wherever they
may be threatened ! It is a nice-sounding phrase
and likely to fool the unthinking Australian,
but for centuries to come Australian interests can
only be threatened on Australian soil. We have
no interests outside Australia. It is sheer non-
sense to talk about the protection of Australian
foreign trade. As far as the necessaries of life are
concerned, Australia is the producer and Britain
the trader. What is called “Australian trade” by
the men with a disproportion of waist-band to
hat-band is mostly British trade, and it is the
Briton who should pay for its protection. Our
own coastal shipping is another matter : that we
should protect ourselves. It is admitted by Gen.
Hutton that the peculiarly isolated position of
the continent makes it practically impossible for
an enemy to attack it in force. Giving his own
words:—
Oversea aggression could only be attempted (1) by »
raid of two or more cruisers, with a small striking force
for the purpose of landing, (2) by a large and well-equipp d
force conveyed in numerous transports and escorted by
an enemy’s fleet. The latter attempt may, under exist-
ing conditions, be considered difficult in the extreme. . . ,
Any force destined for aggression would have to be of
sufficient strength to conquer and hold either an im-'
portant strategical position or a considerable portion of
territory under certain conditions of jeopardising, if not
losing completely, its communications by sea. . . . Efforts
at oversea aggression upon Australian soil will, in all
probability, therefore, be reduced to raids by enemy’s
cruisers on its defended ports.
Out of General Hutton’s own mouth, it is thus
shown that all Australia wants to protect her
interests—interests which do not extend beyond
her own coastal seas —is a well-equipped citizen
array, good coast fortresses, and a handful of war-
ships tied absolutely to her shores. But the
General’s conclusions don’t agree with his facts.
The facts are Australian, the conclusions are Eng-
lish. Let us take the former and reject the latter.
—
Writes a man from the New Hebrides:—
To compare the Burns-Barton Emigration Scheme to
Harley’s South Sea Bubble is to compare a less thing to
a greater, a pair of pigmies to a giant. But they are
both bubbles, and when the Burns-Barton Bubble does
burst it is certain that, though Burns and Barton, who are
apparently carrying on the business of Burns and Pilin',
may declare that they did not know it was loaded, many
innocent persons will be damaged by the fragments. It
should be perfectly cjear to the lawyer who is Federal
Premier, even through the legislative fog that so
frequently obscures the mental vision of politicians, that
he has no right to use Australian money to en-
courage British settlement outside of the Commonwealth.
Nor has he any right to accept from a firm of land specu-
lators the offer of 100,000 acres outside the Common-
wealth. What in the name of common sense has the
Government of Australia to do with “ British ” settlement;,
or “ British” High Commissioners? What an undignified
sight is the Federal Government of Australia in partnership
with an outside land-grab schemeand subsidising a private
company ! It would be amusing, were it not so serious,
to hear the Federal Premier booming the New Hebrides
and breathingforththreateningsandslaughtershould any.
one hint at such mere cold facts as that theyare rocked by
earthquakes and periodically swept clean as with abrooin
by hurricanes, that fever broods over them ceaselessly,

and that white children born in the New Hebrides are
subject to a terrible disease in which their bones rot,
that cannibals delight to bark and bite under the palm
trees, and that man and nature are alike—vile. The en-
terprising firm that has admitted the Federal Govern-
ment as a sleepy partner carries as its house-flag a thistle
rampant and it must gladden the heart of Scotchmen to
know that it blossoms like the rose in the Hebrides
fertilised by Australian money. On this progressive
plant does the Federal Government complacently
browse so far. It would be interesting, to know
why the Federal Government holds a brief in this
fearsome case. The Federal Government as a land-
agent has no originality. Its statements are just as
incredible as any other land agent’s, just as inflated, and
just as unreliable. Why has this undesirable land not
found tenants hitherto? Simply because most of the land
now available in the New Hebrides is absolutely worthless
and will produce nothing. And in the Cannibal Islands,
owing to the habit of intercostal interment, it is difficult
even to raise the dead—let alone to raise a crop.

The “Runaway Girl” is due at Sydney
Royal on Saturday, and (unless some unexpected
deviation was made from the programme after
these few well-chosen remarks were written) the
very brief career of Janet Waldorf’s co. has
already come to an end. A three nights’ season
of the frequent ‘ ‘ Romeo and J uliet ” opened last
Saturday, and the violent and ill-regulated families
of the Capulets and the Montagues battered each
other in Verona after their usual illogical fashion.
A shoddy little royal family, with the sur-
name Ladder or Staircase (at least that is the
English of it) ruled in Verona about the alleged
date of Shakespeare’s story, and it is difficult to
imagine what Can Grande I. and Can Grande 11.
and Can Signorini, and the other members of it,
were about to allow such proceedings as the
dramatist details. The gross incompetence of
this family of Cans was apparently the
cause of a nice girl’s death when Juliet
met her untimely fate. Miss Janet Waldorf’s
Juliet confirmed the impression she created as
Rosalind. She is not likely to combust the
dry, old city of Verona to an extent which
will greatly affect the insurance. She gives a
bright, intelligent rendering of the part, and it is
a bright, intelligent face that looks down on
Romeo from the balcony of Capulet’s unencum-
bered freehold property. This writer isn’t so
sure as he was last week that Miss Waldorf’s voice
is hard, and begins to be somewhat pleased with
the variety of that speaking organ. Also she has
a suitable waist and other good qualities, though
to speak of her as a star of any very great magni-
tude would be absurd. Norval M‘Gregor’s
Romeo proved only a moderate production. H. H.
Vincent’s Mercutio was really excellent; so were
Athol wood’s Friar Lawrence, and Mrs. Walter
Hill’s nurse. The Waldorf co. has fled through
Sydney so quickly that it is impossible to
adequately size it up. Until the members of a
new combination have time to settle down, and
borrow money off each other, and become really
acquainted, they are not seen to the fullest
advantage. Also when a recently burnt-out
manager opens on new premises and puts up three
dramas in ten days that handicaps trie co. some-
what. Making allowance for all the circumstances
the Janet Waldorf co. has done very good work.
** * *
“ The Merry World ” musical comedietta
at Sydney Palace should be given a better place
on the programme. Coming at the end of a very
long performance, it meets a jaded audience and
Buffers accordingly. A bright, merry little trifle,
with an effective chorus and such good performers
in light opera as Ada Willoughby, Rose Suther-
land, and Rose Hamilton taking the principal
parts, it is worthy of being the “ star ” turn of a
variety entertainment. This Saturday, another
“ great attraction ” is announced, Wong Ching
Gong and family, jugglers, who will drive a coach
and four through the Aliens Immigration Restric-
tion Act, write out 50 words in a European
language, and do many other wonderful things.
That is not how the programme puts it, but The
Bulletin’s own lie. Regarded as a lie invented
hurriedly on a wet day, it is not so bad.
'** * *
Sydney’s long-deserted Criterion Theatre
is to be re-opened on Saturday by the Alfred
Woods and Maud Williamson dramatic co. which
proposes to play the “Gates of Bondage.” It is
explained that this is Hall Caine’s “Deemster”
dramatised in five acts by Miss Williamson her-
self. The “ Deemster” is not quite new in
Sydney, but there is always a hope and possibility
that Miss Williamson, who is a tall girl with a
bright smile and a good deal of ability, has so far
departed from the original that the old story will
be nearly unrecognisable. The title commits her
to nothing, but as a matter of fact the title of
almost any melodrama will do for almost any other
melodrama just as well. A great deal of trouble
would be saved if all melodramas bore the same
name, and nobody would be any the worse. The
name need not mean anything so long as it is
large and gloomy. “The Bones of Gloom” is
hereby entered for the competition as a useful
expression that would serve almost as many
purposes as a hair-pin.
#* * *
“ The Span of Life ” draws to its last
nights at Sydney Lyceum, after which “ In Sight
of St. Paul’s” will supply some new assassina-
tions and another brand of shock. Meanwhile the
marvellous Six continue to take their acrobatic
genius to the wilds of Africa to get the heroine
and her friends out of trouble, and the ship near
the Coffin Rocks moves with surprising steadiness
through a violent storm, and doesn’t heave worth
a cent in very trying circumstances.
*% * *
“What Women Wed,” at Sydney Empire,
is a good comedy, which is not much spoiled by
the Cosgrove company acting it. The Cos-
groveians, in a fit of industry, studied their parts
to a quite unusual extent before the curtain rose
on the opening night, and knew a great deal more
than usual about what they intended to say or do
—not that they were needlessly positive even this
time. Various samples of what women wed
appear on the stage in the course of the comedy.
A schoolgirl marries somebody called Vivian ;
her teacher throws herself away on a son of the
aristocracy for the glory of keeping him in
scented pocket handkerchiefs by hard graft.
When the eau-de-cologne and champagne and
other necessaries of life cannot be kept up by
school-teaching, she elects to gain more by
appearing in comic opera every night. The comic
opera business is an entire secret, and the husband
a semi-secret, so that she leads not a double but a
treble life. This gets on her nerves, so that she
ends up by thrashing the blue-blooded one round
the stage in Act 111. After this peace is con-
sidered to be restored. None of the actresses are
very suitable to their parts, though Miss May
Renno has lifelike touches and Miss Cissy
Whiteford makes a convincing small girl in a
bright, short frock, such as no boarding-school
would permit a pupil to sport merely to do sums
in. John Cosgrove keeps the drama on its legs
as the blue-blooded personage who gets up early
at eleven o’clock or so, and brother Tom is the
usual gambolling servant-boy that would only be
retained in a lunatic asylum controlled by one of
the incurable inmates.
*# * *
By the time these remarks appear Fitz-
geralds’ Circus will have folded its tent and
vanished into space with its gentle Boxing Kan-
garoo, its heavy elephant-riding Lion, and all the
various persons who traverse space in the sure and
certain hope of getting their feet or their teeth
against something solid at the other end. It was
a varied show, on the whole, and the animal
element was strong, so that the part of Sydney
that likes entertainments of this sort, and
especially the small boys who creep in under the
tent-walls in an unostentatious manner, are sorry
to see it go.
** * *
Sydney Tivoli has, during the week, wel-
comed back old favorites in Derenda and Breen,
the comic club jugglers ; Peggy Pryde has given
her opinion of men with the same strident vigor
nightly ; and Callahan and Mack, in their idyll of
Irish peasant life, have helped to keep the lease
and goodwill of the Tivoli together.
** * *
A Brough testimonial project started in
Melbourne by Mayor Gillott, Surgeon Fitzgerald,
little Zeal and others was nipped in the bud by a
letter from the farewelling manager, as soon as
he heard of the circular that had been sent
around. The letter said: “Mrs. Brough and I
have been informed that some of our friends
desire to present us with a tangible token of their
good-will, and we very sincerely appreciate their
kind thought. At the same time we hope that you
and others will understand a feeling that prompts
us in anticipating you, and denying ourselves the
pleasure of accepting this, and that you and they
will not consider us ungracious in so doing. We
have had so many proofs of friendship, and believe
our friends are so closely associated with us, that
we venture to ask them not to further increase
the debt of gratitude we already owe to them.
Their loyalty to us as artists for over 17 years
speaks for itself as to their recognition of our work
&c. &c. ” The manager who refuses a positively
farewell testimonial from his old adherents is
something more than grateful if gratitude means
only a lively sense of favors to come. There are
no more Melbourne favors to come for Robert
Brough and his wife. They are going away with
a lively sense of the popularity they have enjoyed
among all sorts of people in the past, including
the large number who lately have got into a habit
of thinking themselves “tired of the Broughs.”
Manager Robert remarks philosophically that
the public have never failed to support his
management and warmly appreciate the work of
the co., when he managed to put up the right
play, and when he didn’t the fault was his.
Everywhere in Melbourne one hears it
said with always the same emphasis— ‘ ‘ I’m going
to pay my guinea to hear Melba.” The guinea
limit has been fixed by public opinion seemingly,
but the idea of an auction sale of seats for the
first concert is resented. As a matter of fact
Musgrove, before he left for London the other
week, stated that he had no intention of auctioning
any Melba seats. The box-plan will be open to
the public—first come, first served—and no
large purchases of tickets by speculators will be
permitted. Musgrove hopes to gain popularity
by his management of the Melba tour. He can’t
make much profit.
** * *
The last week of the Broughs at Melbourne
Princess’s commenced on Saturday with a revival
of “ A Village Priest,” which fiije dramatic play
brought out all the heavy-artillery resources of the
present co. The performance, if not forcible at
every point, was stronger in some respects than
the last revival. Brough is a good, improving
Abbe, though one would still prefer to see him in
his old part of the grizzled convict. Mrs. Brough,
whose acting grows very patchy of late, strikes a
powerful patch in her scene with Armand, where
also Ernest Vere (as the Armand aforesaid)
makes an expected impression. Charles Garry
is the second best convict Melbourne has
seen, and the other characters are kindly treated
by Miss Vaughan, Miss Gillies Brown, Miss
Temple and Miss Brenda Gibson. The two latter,
like Mrs. Brough, repeat their original griefs of
nearly ten years ago. But all this refers to what
happened on Saturday and Monday. Two per-
formances of “The Liars” were to follow the
play that Sydney Grundy borrowed from the
French ; to-night (Thursday) “Sowing the Wind”
will reappear for the last time, and to-morrow
“Mrs. Tanqueray ” will bring the long and honor-
able series of Brough seasons to an end, it is said.
&* # *
Frank Thornton and his newly-imported
co. take the Princess’s stage on Saturday (3rd),
with the definite intention of stopping there three
weeks. Thornton has, one time or other, been a
popular identity at three other Melb. theatres,
but this will be his first time at the Princess’s,
which is probably not the reason why he will pro-
duce “ Facing the Music, ” preceded by “A Test
Match.” The double bill looks promising, because
Frank Thornton’s previous shows have been roar-
ingly successful as a rule. Also, there is a hopeful
appearance about the fact that old friend Alec.
Mayne will figure as “ representative ” in front of
the house. Memory associates Mayne with
Brough and Boucicault’s highest old times at the
Bijou.
** * *
Her Majesty’s is taking two nights’ rest
after the lucrative season of “Dorothy,” and the
departure of the comic-opera co. for other pas-
tures, but on Saturday business will be resumed
at that roomy establishment. Miss Janet Wal-
dorf and the co. who played “As You Like It”
in Sydney will transfer their Shakespearian effort
to the place where Lauri lately took a benefit.
Melbourne has not seen any sort of Rosalind for
some years, therefore the arrival of one said to be
a good sort is awaited with a considerable amount
of sober enthusiasm.
** * #
Saturday (3rd) is to bring “ The Favorite ”
to light at Melb. Royal, and preparations for
Anderson’s horsey drama are proceeding on the
usual scale of completeness. Meanwhile, “Greed
of Gold ” continues to strike one of its characters
dumb. The plot seems calculated to strike them
all dumb, but up to now the other people have
preserved their power of speech, and, with the
exception of the ballet, they talk freely.
** * *
At the Bijou a new bill has been ordered
for the same night, owing to the revolutionary
spirit of the times. The manager who didn’t
change his bill this Saturday would run a risk of
being classed as an Unprogressive, hence the
announcement that the “Wrong Mr. Wright ” will
go into recess after Friday. “ Smith ”is taking
over the business from “ Wright.” Smith is the
man who meditates the defeat or death of his
wife’s aunt by means of a horrible “ angel ” cake,
and a good many people remember with regret
that the first Australian Secretary of the Cook
Ladies’ Union will nevermore be guilty of that
cake.
** * *
Marshall-Hall’s concert at the Town Hall
last Saturday was not too severely classical for
the ordinary admirers of “ great ” music. In
Beethoven’s “Leonore,” No. 3 Overture, fifty-five
instrumentalists did their best to play up to the
apostle’s narrative description of the master’s
meaning. No orchestra could possibly persuade
any sane public that Hall’s narrative, extending
to about 80 lines of small type, is not gorgeous
nonsense for the most part, but this Orchestra
presented the alleged adventures of Leonore
and her bloke in an impressive musical
light anyhow.- The more naturally popu-
lar “ Pastoral Symphony ” wa3 perhaps not
quite so well played, nevertheless it pleased
the audience for nearly 40 minutes, which is say-
ing much for all parties concerned in the perform-
ance, from Beethoven down to the second bassoon.
Madame Weidermann, in sombre tones and a be-
coming black silk costume, sang a couple of songs
(in glommerglumen German) from Wagner’s ;
“Tristan und Isolde,” and then young August
Siede had the glory of conducting the first
performance on record of a new Symphonic Over-
ture, composed by himself. The overture has
one brief lapse into affable melodiousness, also
one distinctive feature, for its ending sounds very
like an introduction to something else. Also it is
without doubt a most musicianly work, insofar
that it provides active and harmonious employ-
ment for many instruments at one time. But it
suggests that the painstaking Siede might have
spent his time much better in trying to strike out
an Australian line of composition for himself. Why
more symphonic overtures at this late hour of the
day ? Why not try to produce a musical impres-
sion of a picnic in the Bush —a Sunday-school
picnic, with its incidental giddiness, for choice —
or a service in the Jenolan Oaves ?
** * *
At Rickards’ Opera House the estimable
Craggs are executing their greased lightning
acrobatics for the last time in Melbourne to-night
(Thursday). Also Pastor, the laugher, and the
young man described as “Australia’s baritone,”
are about to pass on and leave room for new
arrivals.
♦
Qerardy, the wizard of the ’cello, starts his next Aus-
tralian tour in Melbourne early in July. Thus far there
has been no confirmation of the melancholy rumor that
young Gerardy intends to get married before returning
to the haunts of the Australian girl, so the damsels who
chased him last year may continue to hope on.

The National Bank’s profits represent £4 7s. 7d.
per cent per annum on the shareholders’ funds as at the
commencement of the half year. This is a very substan-
tial improvement on the £4 Is. 9d. per cent, earned dur-
ing the half-year, which ended 30th September, 1901;
still, it is a much lower rate than many Australian banks
are realising just now, and the growth of the new reserve
is not at all rapid. It would certainly have been much
better if the increase of the ordinary dividend from 3 to
3j per cent, had been postponed for another two years.

The reserve of cash and liquid securities stands at 39 per
cent, upon all liabilities to the public, which is a very
durable amount, and the worst feature in this connection
is the decline in the reserve of State securities. Other-
wise, there is nothing very remarkable about the figures.

This entry has been standing for a long time on
the notice-paper of the House of Representatives
Mr. Chapman : To move —That, in the opinion of this
House, it is desirable that the Commonwealth should
take over a proportion of the public debts of the States
according to the respective numbers of their people, as
soon as the same can be done on terms of any substantial;
profit to the Commonwealth and the States concerned.
The matter being one of the greatest urgency, and|
having apparently dropped out of notice, The Bulletins
would like to advertise it a little by moving these amendt
ments:
That the Commonwealth shall take over the public-
debts in question, even if no immediate profit cap be;,
seen. There must be an ultimate profit by their consol.-,
dation and unification.
That the interest payable on these debts and" the?
amounts paid for the management of the said debts*
at the date of taking them over, and a. fur then
amount equal to £ per cent, on the debts, shall be-
made a fixed charge on the revenues of the Common*
wealth till the debts are repaid. The said;£ per cent,,
and all moneys saved by conversion of the debt into*
lower-priced stock, by reduction of the debt, and: by
economy in management, shall .be devoted; to the repay-
ment of loans as they fall due until the whole debt is-
extinguished.
That as there are debts falling d.:p every year for the-
next 19 years (and almost every year after that); the-
amounts varying from £835,000 to £11,763,800, and; these-
debts are being renewed by the States at great loss>
which loss might be saved, in part at least, if the Federal
Government offered its own, consolidated; stock with
sinking-fund attached, the case is urgent, and the matter-
should be attended to as soon, as the tariff is- out of the
way.
That the Constitution, shall be amended as soon as
possible to empower the Federal Government to take over
other State debts besides those which existed at the
beginning of the Commonwealth, and consolidate and
redeem them also.

The profits are equivalent to £lO 18s. Id. per cent, per
annum on the shareholders’ funds, as at the commencement
of the half-year—a quite unusual figure, even in this
period of revival. Both the big Anglo-Australian Banks
(Australasia and Union), after a long- period of very un-
obtrusive progress, about doubled their profits inside six
months, just when the war broke out, though whether
any business or circumstances or pickings arising in Eng-
land as a consequence of the war were responsible for
this pleasing result is another matter. The Bank of
Australasia now holds £13,878,371 of deposits (an increase
of £227,539 during the past 12 months); and its reserve
of cash and liquid securities is £5,111,820 (a decrease of
£622,543, but still equal to 30 per cent, on all liabilities to
the public). The reserves, for the first time in the ’Asia’s
history, have passed the million limit. Taking all the
evidences into consideration the honored names of Jeans,
manager, and Blogg, accountant, are appended to a highly
satisfactory balance-sheet, despite the fact that the profits
are dropping away a little from the sensational figure
attained in October, 1900.

of progression keeps up, will see its accumulated funds
pass the £200,000,000 point. There are possibilities of a
time when three or four large assurance companies, by
their control of the world’s wealth, will practically direct
its affairs, and make war or peace, and upset dynasties,
and direct annexations, and make the Chamberlains of
this earth sit up when they are told, and the Sahsburys
sit down when directed, and even speak plainly and
forcibly to Edward VII.
The expense rate of the Equitable remains
about the same. The figures for the last six years have
been :
Expenses in Proportion to Total Income.
1896.. £l7 12 6 per cent. 1899.. £lB 10 3 per cent.
1897. 17 3 3 „ 1900.. 16 19 5 „
1898.. 16 2 0 „ 1901.. 17 1 8 „
These rates are not very high for a society which does
such a large proportion of new business—which is also the
most expensive kind of business. The interest earned
can’t be accurately ascertained—the fact that the co. took
over during the year the business and funds of a small
rival institution is a disturbing element—but on paper it
is £4 Is. lid. per cent on the average funds, or £4 15s. sd.
per cent, if the gain in valuation of assets is included.
This latter is a very handsome figure, and distinctly above
the Australian average. The increase in the value of
assets is almost a regular source of income with United
States life offices, whose funds are mostly invested in
Government, municipal, and railway securities and free-
hold properties, which, amid the general prosperity of
the country, have a very regular upward tendency. In
debt-laden Australia, where the weary process of writing
off losses and depreciation appears to have no end, this
source of income is practically unknown, barring the fact
that an obscure co. occasionally inflates the paper value
of its office property to avoid showing a deficit, or for
some other purpose. The Equitable Life has now, on a 4
per cent, valuation, a splendid surplus of £14,797,717, and
its assets all appear unimpeachable, except that foolish
paper item : “ Deferred premiums on policies when paid
semi-annually or quarterly deductible from amount in-
sured in case of claim, £526,003.” Far too many offices
are addicted to this silly paper asset. It doesn’t amount
to much among nearly £69,000,000 of assets, but it is a
purposeless affair, and as the Equitable could write it off
without serious damage to its surplus, it should be
written off.

Last Monday Sydney Telegraph admitted in
its commercial column that “ the States and the Com-
monwealth greatly need a £9,000,000 tariff, and it is likely
to be £500,000 short.” This is the natural result of the
cutting down effected by the party whose interests lie in
the suppression of Australian manufactures —the
M’Millans and their kind, who live by importing the goods
of the English, French, and German manufacturers. And
the Telegraph, which admits that the tariff is already
lower than Australia can afford, is hollering to have it
further cut down in the interests of this country’s
enemies.

The reserves consist of reserve fund, £100,000; undivided
profit, £15,498, and reserve for equalisation of dividends,
£20,000. The latter is an objectionable item in this sense,
that when the profits of any concern fall off so badly that
it has to draw on its reserve to maintain its dividend it
has generally fallen into a state in which the reserves are
much more urgently required for the purpose of writing
off losses. In other words, the only time when a reserve
for equalisation of dividends is really wanted is a time
when it is, as a rule, wholly unjustifiable to draw upon it
for the purpose for which it is intended—therefore it is
much better to merge it in the general reserve. Tooth
and Co. raises its dividend a point this half-year. It has
£137,619 (more than its whole reserve) invested in N.S.W.
Government securities, and £32,837 in cash. The income
from interest alone (£9149) is sufficient to pay a 2 per
cent, dividend. Altogether Tooth’s is a fine and en-
couraging example of the growth of a carefully pro-
tected industry in an allegedly Freetrade country.

It is expected that there will shortly be floated
the first Commonwealth loan—£2so,ooo to begin with,
and almost all of it for unproductive works which should
be paid out of revenue. Even the works which profess to
be productive are only patches, repairs, or replacements
of worn-out works which were not paid for. The loan is
to have a sinking fund attached which will repay it in
about 47 years—which, even if some Treasurer doesn’t
annex the sinking fund, will be 30 years after most of the
works are worn out or obsolete. The Constitution
gives the Federal Government power to retain for its
own use a quarter of the customs and excise, and
if it retained that quarter it needn’t float any
loan, but the habit of floating a loan is in-
curable. The tea duty, which the Federal Parliament
threw away with a light heart and an idiotic grin, wasn’t
heavy enough to hurt anybody, and if it were replaced,
with a definite instruction from Parliament that the pro-
ceeds were to be used for Federal public works, there
would be no need for any loan. The Federal Parliament
has unlimited powers of taxation outside of customs and
excise, and if it used some of them there would be no
need for any loan. But the borrowing leprosy has
become so bad in Australia that the Federal Government
apparently feels it to be its duty to have a loan, even if
it doesn’t require one. No family is complete without a
loan, in fact.

The Ocean Accident and Guarantee Corpora-
tion, an English co. of great size which does a large busi-
ness in Australia, closed a rather unfortunate year on 31st
December, 1901. The passing of the British Workmen’s
Compensation Act (which came in force Ist July, 1898) is
partly responsible. This opened up an immense new
business, for there was a scramble of employers to re-insure
their liability. A number of small and unduly excited
companies arose and rushed for this new business at low
rates. Some of the old companies refused to cut rates
and let most of the new business go past their doors, and
these mostly prospered. The Ocean, among others,
reached out for the new business rather recklessly,
acquired a very large amount of it, and only now begins
to have doubts about its value. As a number of the small,
excited new companies have already retired, it is hoped
that the worst of the rate-cutting process is over, also
the managements are becoming better acquainted with
the nature of Employers’ Liability Insurance under the
new laws, so affairs may shortly improve. In recent years
the Ocean Co.’s experience has been as follows :

Owing to the form in which the accounts are
presented and the constant increase of capital it is
difficult to be certain of the rate per cent, of the dividend
in one or two cases, but the amount of it is shown clearly
enough. After a period of amazing expansion the
Ocean Accident and Guarantee Corporation is in this
position : Between 1895 and 1901 its reserves have in-
creased by £605,639, but of this £177,082 was subscribed
by the shareholders themselves, and only £428,557 is
accumulated profit. With the enormous increase of the
business, a much larger proportion of the reserves (no
less than £345,302) has to be set apart to cover unex-
pired risks. The really sensational profit was made in
1898, when the great rush of employers’-liability insurance
set in, and the income more than doubled in one year—
that is to say, the great rush of new premiums
arrived, paid in advance, and the claims didn’t fairly
begin to arrive till later. Since then, though the
business has kept increasing the profits have grown con-
stantly less till last year (despite the fact that the share-
holders have put another £250,000 or so into the concern
which is earning interest that helps to sw T ell the profits)
they were only half what they were in 1895, when the
income was one-fifth the size. Apparently, therefore,
experience shows that the new business, which was really
of an experimental character, has been taken at inade-
quate rates, and isn’t nearly so valuable as it looked. The
only way it can be made valuable, apparently, is by
raising the rates, if the competition allows of that, or by
rejecting the less profitable business.

which has been going on since 1899, the 8 per cent, divi-
dend now absorbs a good deal more than the old 10 per
cent, one did, and as the earnings have not increased
correspondingly, the outlook for the shareholders is not
what it was. The reserves have mostly disappeared in
two heavy writings-off, and even assuming that all losses
and depreciation are now provided for, there is very little
margin (unless the profits increase, or the dividend is
further reduced) for rebuilding Che reserve fund.

The satisfactory price at which flax stands in
England (£34 per ton) has given a stimulus to the industry
in M.L., and South Islanders hope to reap a fine harvest.
New mills are being reared in hot haste at Lake Brunner,
Kumara, Lake Mahinapua, and further south, while the
established mills in the North Island have been roused
to increased activity. Profits on the fibre are large just
now, and indications are that present figures will be
maintained for some time. Regulations have been framed

Some of the smart millers fell in this year by
refusing to go into the local market as buyers of wheat, pre-
ferring to wait and get it at their price later on. But the
speculator had to be reckoned with, and he bought up
much grain for export. Now the millers must buy at an
advance of about Is. 3d. per bushel, or else import from
America and give the Federal revenue a helping hand.
Had the millers acted fairly they would have got their
grain at Sd. less per bushel than they have to pay now,
and the producer would have benefited by at least 6d. ;
as it is the middleman has scored.

Silver the other day got down to 2s. ; it has only
once been lower. The Broken Hill mines used to get from
3s. 6d. to 4s. 2d. for it, and in one half-year a parcel of
“ fine ” sold for 4s. 9Jd. The world’s yield of the metal
has been standing almost still for nearly ten years. Long
ago 23J-times more (in weight) of silver than of gold
was produced ; the ratio is now only 12 to 1, which is the
lowest since the sixties. If ordinary rules applied to
silver its price ought therefore to streak up ; but an
artificial price was preserved so long (the U.S. dropped it
only 12 years or so back), and so many Govt, cellars became
stuffed with the metal, that ordinary rules don’t apply.
No doubt, if the world doesn’t want as much silver as it
used to, the market can go on falling in spite of a
diminishing output. Yet a diminishing output must tend
to keep the price steady ; while if the demand keeps
steady, a diminishing output must mean rising prices.
The writer doesn’t know what the demand is ; 12 different
authorities tell 12 different yarns about it. But, taking
into account only the much-reduced and still reducing
ratio of silver to gold won, the position looks better for
silver-men than it has done for four or five years, notwith-
standing the 2s. quotation. Anything in the shape of a
substantial or rapid advance is, for all that, hopeless.

Junction North people did very little in the half-
year to March 31. They repaired and secured the shaft (the
work had become “an imperative necessity”) and started
driving at 1037 ft. They will dawdle along with this, to
tap the lode, while the lead-market is mending. Mean-
time, for a co. that is doing practically nothing the ex-
penses are much too high. Mine wages last half were
£9OB, and expenses of management £417. The co. has a
surplus of liquid assets, mostly cash, of £3695. The
directors, or some of them, have been anxious to get
Block 10 mill working on two shifts daily again ; but it
cannot be done without reducing the grade of ore
put through. As at Block 14 it is picked stuff
that has been going up. As a guide to the value
of the lode, the mill-assays are thus worthless.
There has been an improvement in Block 10 values
lately ; but it is doubtful whether it can be kept
up. One of this co.’s shafts is giving a great deal of
trouble. No B.H. mine has improved so much lately as
the South.

Cobar Gold Mines (late Fort Bourke): Last
year 72,403 tons of ore, 43,211 tons of tailings, 22,934 tons
of slimes were treated for 16,4790z5. gold of the value of
£51,276, the gross profit being £11,590, nearly the whole
of which was written off for development and deprecia-
tion. Disappointing results attributed to three causes :
falling off in value of ore for a considerable period, assays
at one time being as low as 3Jdwts. ; presence of copper
in the ore at 216 ft. and delaj'in starting the slimes-plant.
Recent advices show an improvement in ore-value—aver-
age 6dwts. January returns showed a net profit
of £lBB5. Manager confident that dividends will
be paid during current year. Mining charges 4s. lOd.
per ton, milling 2s. Sjd., tailings, 3s. 6Jd. A parcel of ore
sent to smelter returned Bdwts. 19grs. per ton, and 4.8
per cent, copper. It is inexplicable why co. does not
sink below 200 ft. to test the lode. Chances are that the
mine will become a valuable one in copper and gold,
particularly in the southern section where there is a
massive ironstone outcrop beneath which there should be
a big body of solid sulphide ore.

Writes Waddy : —Cobar mining is at a very low
ebb just now through drought. Mt. Drysdale, Occidental,
Young Australian, Great Western, Mt. Pleasant, Fort
Bourke (Oobar Gold Mines) are all practically shut down.
Chesney is to close as soon as Woolcock’s concentrating
trial is finished, and the big mine (Great Cobar) must
follow suit in a couple of weeks. Many have been
the concentrating experts at work on Chesney ore,
and of them all Woolcock seems to be making the best
show. Chesney ore is not easy to concentrate
successfully (i.e., to get 70 or 80 per cent, out) as the sul-
phide (in itself very good) exists largely in thin lamina-
tions, making it difficult to concentrate without a more
complex system of classification—for equal weights of
round grains and flat grains do not concentrate equajly,
as Chesney has too often demonstrated. On the trial,
half the plant is working 12 hours daily, and the length
of the run (about two weeks) is very short to prove real
working conditions.

Fort Bourke makes free mention of the copper
in the lower levels in the last report to hand, but nothing
seems to be done to see what the value of the copper is
below. Said report must be a shock to Australian share-
holders. Mining expenses are not likely to be much less,
more especially as the ore is now got from fairly heavy
ground needing a lot of timber and care, and if the new
Mines Inspection Act is administered as passed, it will
not improve the next balance-sheet of Fort Bourke.

The Occidental people have also been bumped
by the same Act and made to do a lot of practically
useless work — i.e., useless for the purpose intended— and
the exact interpretation of the open-cut clause in the Act
is being anxiously awaited by the owners, the Occi-
dental being a pure open-cut, with a shaft sunk alongside
“the cut” for haulage purposes. If the clause men-
tioned is strictly carried into force the Occidental must
shut up.

The wisdom of O’Gorman’s big dam is now

taking the lesson to heart sufficiently to excavate a few

enough for a div., break their necks in their hurry to cut
up the unwonted coin, and let water-conservation go.
The big co. is gradually increasing its storage by the holes
made in procuring filling for the mine ; as for the rest
their trust in Providence is large—for Cobar.

erected and slime treatment plant on same lines as that
of Cobar Gold Mines is going up. Stopped for water like
the rest of them, but they are making provision by a
second 40,000-yard tank. The mine has its poor spots,
and the 12dwt. average of the first crushing campaign
didn’t come out of these places. There seem to be two
short (longitudinal) shoots of stone in the main lode
running over an ounce up to two, which are mighty
handy to sweeten up a poor crushing. It isn’t hard to see
where they are either, if you go underground. The stone
is very hard, agatised almost, and the rate of crushing is
only a little over a ton per stamp per day, and in a modern
mill this tells its own tale. A very curious bend is visible
in the lode, underground—practically a right-angle turn,
something not often seen. All the plant is good and
strong, and, given rain, this mine will be heard of, but
hardly as a constant 12dwt. proposition. Say Bdwts.
Outside of the established mines, the prospect-
ing shows are nothing. They seem principally to be
worked by Govt, aid, through which, ’tis said, Mt. Boppy
was found ; but history sayeth not if a kind and paternal
Govt, collected its advances when the property was sold.

Payne’s copper process said to be treating Lewis
Ponds (N.S.W.) ore at ss. 9d. per ton. It is a wet pro-
cess, and published descriptions do not disclose any
difference from methods of precipitation which were in
use b.c. Rio Tinto ore is treated solely by leaching after
roasting ; and the main source of Wallaroo and Moonta
revenue is from the lixiviation of that which, until
ecently, was considered waste material. Apart from the
merits of the Payne process, there can be no question
that under many conditions lixiviation is preferable to
smelting of low-grade ores. If the reported results from
the Payne process are correct, there are some fat divs. to
be earned from the enormous accumulation of tailings
and slimes (from 2 to 3 per cent, value) at Girilam-
bone mine, to say nothing about the hundreds of thou-
sands of tons of suitable ore in the top sections of the
mine.

Hannan’s Eureka has given the finishing blow
to that much-boomed district, Davyhurst, by abandoning
its option on a property there. There is no longer any
excuse for the existence of this ancient wild cat, and the
sooner investors recognise this, and also the selfish
trickiness of Adelaide directors, the better will it be for
their pockets. The chairman pointed out that, though
the original property was forfeitable for non-payment of
rent and non-fulfilment of labor conditions, no one had
worried about jumping the ground. Nine-tenths of the
Adelaide companies’ mines are quite safe from the jumper,
if forfeitable to-morrow, as no jumper would look at them.

Frank Gardner thinks that Perseverance yields
will be brought up to 17,0000 z. per month, and that £2
per year should be paid in divs. The “ low price of the
shares reflects discredit on the discrimination of the
mining investor.” He estimates the value at £3O per
share. Frank was ever modest.

Attempts are being made to re-gal vanise that well-
known Kauffmann litter of decayed “ cats,” the Standard
Exploration Co. Proposed scheme provides for flotation of
a new co. of £500,000 in £2 shares. Of new issue, holders
in old co. to be entitled to one share paid up to 14s. for
every two held, or 382,820 in all. Of the assessment of
65., is. is payable on application, Is. on allotment, and
balance in calls of 2s. at intervals of not less than three
months, as required. If fully subscribed this will provide
£114,846, out of which creditors will get £24,450 in cash,
and £3,000 will be lodged in court to fight promoters and
directors for malfeasance. This would leave £87,396 net,
subject to heavy deduction for liquidation and flotation
expenses. Creditors also receive 73,678 fully paid shares,
bringing total issue to 456,498, with 43,502 in reserve.
With the possible exception of Paddington Consols (W.A.)
none of the 12 mines owned by the old co. are of any
value as gold mines, and several are already forfeited and
abandoned. The scheme is absurd on the face of it, and
is hardly likely to see fruition. Meanwhile Paddington
Consols has been pawned for £15,000 with which to
appease pressing Australian creditors. Seems a poor
deal for the mortgagees—a great Eastern wool-firm—
unless they can refloat co.

Golden Arrow (W.A.), bossed by ex-cornstalk
Charles Edward Hogg, going to reconstruct for fourth
time. Proposed new co. is to have the mere trifle of
1,000,000 shares of ss. each. Holders of old scrip are
entitled to three new fully-paid ss. shares for each £1
share held, and have option of applying for one new ss.
share carrying a 2s. liability, payable 6d. on application,
6d. on allotment and balance as required. This will
provide £25,000 when fully called up and is guaranteed by
Hogg and Co. As a market movement of Is. will mean
£50,000 on total scrip, Hogg is evidently possessed of
high-falutin’ ideas of finance. Mine now got the rich but
patchy Hill End chute, but what is that to a million-scrip
co. ? As a few divs. are in sight the shares might be worth
a flutter if there were not such a lot. But a million 1

Great Fingall must have had a big slice of luck
during March as the 40-head battery is said to have run
744 hours, and treated 5084 tons for 86390 z. including
tailings and concentrates. This means that the battery
ran throughout the 31 days of March without losing the
fraction of a second, and the record per stamp was 4.1 tons
daily. Truly a marvellous performance, and justly
heralded by the shares reaching the £9 mark. But what
will the godly John Bull say to this public flouting of the
Sabbath 7

A Fingall wild cat, omitted from last week’s
notes, is the Great Fingall Main Reef (W.A.), launched
into this vale of tears by the Mount Yagahong crowd—
also responsible for such felines as Star of the East, Nan-
nine Consols, Nannine Goldfields, Nowthanna, Champion
Reef, and Champion Extended. All these have suffered
numerous reconstructions, and shareholders got no
return.

South Kalgurli (W.A.) plant has now got fairly
into its stride, and during March 2800 oz. were got from
2780 tons. It was alleged by the management that with
such a yield profits of £5OOO monthly would be earned,
but this figure is hardly likely to be realised. In last
financial year the co. treated 17,000 tons for 16,5000 z. of
gold, worth £63,000, for a paltry profit of under £lOOO.
This makes working costs £3 13s. per ton. Enlarged
plant Is treating exactly double the tonnage for double
the quantity of gold, or, say 34,000 tons for £126,000. At
a profit of £5OOO monthly the year’s expenses would only
amount to £66,000, or £ll9s. per ton—a reduction of 46J
per cent. Unless developments and repairs are totally
sacrificed no such result need be looked for. This mine
is bone-dry, and water alone must cost the co. at least 3s.
per ton treated. Net profit will probably pan out not
much more than half the predicted amount. Even so,
shares at current prices should be a fair spec.

Imperial Boulder (W.A.), after being fooled to
squander money on a Davyhurst wild cat, came to the
end of its tether, and is asking tenders for its machinery
and plant. And to think that, in the 1899 boom, the
scrip of this rotten concern was eagerly snapped up at
6s. apiece 1 The only consolation is that, one by one,
the Adelaide-bossed stringers are fast disappearing.
The sooner the lot are wiped off the slate, and the direc-
tors go back to jam-making and kindred pursuits
the better. In mining they are a dismal failure, and, in
finance, they’re children.

A few days ago the great and only Lake View
Consols (W. A.) was for the first time in its history thrown
open to press reps. Needless to say that nothing remark-
able happened, and the press and the public are not one
whic worse or better off than before : for the matter of
that, neither is the mine nor the management. When a
mine has been in existence for seven years, and has a
shaft down 1150 ft., and levels opened up at every 100 ft.
down to 1000 ft., and for the past year has done 1000 ft. of
development monthly, it would take Plugger Bill on his
bike to get round the course in a shift. The only
thing apparent is that in many places, owing
to slackness of assaying, the drives have lost the lode, and
the manager “ dunno where ’e are.” The difference
between lode and country is here so slight that nothing
but constant assaying keeps one on the right track, and
that involves at least 25 assays daily. The northern lense
of ore appears to have been lost below 300 ft., and the
southern below 600. The two are connected above 100 ft.,
but not below. The northern lense has been opened up
for a length of 1000 ft. down to 300 ft., but the southern
lense dwindles from a length of 1000 ft. at the three upper
levels to 120 ft. only at 600 ft. level. Very few payable
stopes are at work. The rich Perseverance lode, on the
west of the north block, is practically untouched. The
opinion of the working miners is that, purposely or wit-
lessly, the drives have not followed the lode, and that the
mine has been messed up. This opinion is probably cor-
rect, and is confirmed by the case of the Associated
Northern Blocks before Capt. Rodda’s advent. Under
Irwin’s management, sinking and cross-cutting were done
and nothing payable found. Rodda started by assaying
every foot of one cross-cut till be got on to gold, and, by
following it up, located the continuation of the rich
Brown Hill lode, which has already produced some 5000
tons of Boz. ore, with a good deal more in sight. If Rodda
was bossing L.V. Consols, writer would go nap on it.

Great Boulder Main Reefs (W.A.) March
return reads 19370 z. from 1995 tons. This is the first
return below ounce average. During 1901, co. treated
20,600 tons for 26,6000 z. and paid no div., so what hope is
there from present reduced average! Lower levels
appear to be of little or no value, but as mine, like most
of the Bewick Moreing shows, is a sealed book, and
informers promptly get the bullet, reliable information is
hard to get. Shares are nominally 10s. and quoted at
15s. —unaccountable for a non-div. payer.
• * * *
Brown Hill (W.A.) during past six months
varied its returns between 52640 z. and 52970 z., the other
four returns reading 5280 twice, 5284 and 5286. The
tonnaa'e has ranged from 1863 to 2220, and the average
from 2oz. 7dwt. 14gr. to 2oz. I7dwt. Needless to say the
ounces have been “ adjusted ” ; all other mines “ adjust ”
the tons or averages. Shares in co. are being twisted by
Bewick Moreing, and have jumped from 435. to 555. to
get a better show in proposed amalgamation with
Associated Northern and Oroya. Sec. of latter co.
contradicted in press any intention to amalgamate, but
that may mean anything or nothing in a show run by the
Waldington- Pomeroy - Doolette - Brookman push, who
foisted the patent process prodigy on the Great Boulder.

The Sydney morning papers were dumb as.
oysters over the Tren with -Age fracas. The idea
of the Argus publishing Tren with’s attacks on its
rival in extenso must have paralysed S.M.
Herald editor Curnow. The Sydney dailies rarely
admit each other’s existence, and the Sydney
public miss quite a lot of fun in consequence. Fancy
S’James Fairfax writing a letter to Sydney D.T.
flatly contradicting a statement printed therein
reflecting on his honesty ! Yet David Syme did
this to Melb. Argus ! The whole affair seems
anything but “dignified,” but in these days a
paper with “dignity ’’ gets left. The only person
who comes out well is probably Trenwith. The
spectacle of the Age and Argus quarrelling over
him (for it really amounts to that) is an advt.
rarely.achieved by a politician, and should be his
salvation. If the threatened Protectionist daily
gets going in Sydney, the Telegraph and
Herald will have to alter their methods, even if
only to refer to “our junior morning contem-
porary.”

S.M. Herald, replying to Prof. Wood,
says in a leader that pure Patriotism (not spelt
with a “y”) was the motive which mainly
sent Australians to S’Africa. And at the
exact moment when that Herald leader was
being written, .250 Australian bushmen were
assembled in a city hall, squealing like rats in a
trap because they saw no chance of being accepted
for S’African service. Patriots ? Alas ! poor
devils, they were hungry, most of them—work-
less, penniless, hopeless, and ready to fight for the
Czar, or for the Devil, at five bob a day.
THE SCRUPLES OF THE AMATEUR.
NEOPHYTE: "But, really, I could never make
up my mind to wear tights.”
MANAGER: “My dear, that’s nothing, so long as the rest of you is nicely made-up nobody

Melb. Argus has curdled the blood of its
oldest and fattest adherents by telling
Mason that Yic. Assembly has no real use for his
wig, gown and mace, and would rather pay him
at the rate of £6 13s. 4d. per working day than
retain his services at double the amount. The
Parliamentary pomps of the British Constitution
are pardonable enough in poor old Britain, per-
haps, but they never should have been mimicked
in this young country, says the hitherto Tory
journal. The glory of Mason is a ridiculous ex-
travagance ; the Mace is only fit to be stolen in a
mysterious manner, like the bauble which disap-
peared from Matthew Davies’s room of yore;
the gown and wig are insults to commonsense.
Also, the dolled-up President of the Leg. Council
and the Black Rod and other Gruy Fawkesian
features of legislative government are matters that
cry aloud for radical reform or scornful abolition,
says the Argus. The Argus, of all papers! It
is time for The Bulletin to move a vote of
thanks to the little Dook o’ York, who converted
a grovelling organ of “loyalty” into a red repub-
lican rag by omitting to bestow a knighthood or a
photograph on the expectant boss.

The plague, which apparently has a more
or less precarious hold in Sydney, now seems to
have settled down in Brisbane as a regular
•inhabitant and resident elector. Three cases in
one day are not uncommon in Philp’s unclean and
ill-drained capital, and according to the relative
gopulations that is much the same as 13 cases in
ydney.

Some cheerful evidence before the Royal
Commission on Sydney water supply by the
Principal Assistant Engineer to the Water Board,
that has such a marked disinclination to paying
its way :
In the event of the Prospect Reservoir becoming
exhausted, it would become necessary to tap the Nepean
at a little below Penrith, where there was a natural dam
in the river, with a capacity of 1237 million gallons. The
use of the water so obtainable should be restricted. to
what was required for domestic purposes only, for which
10 gallons per day would be an ample allowance. If the
whole population remained in the metropolis there would
thus be a total consumption of 5,000,000 gallons per day.
As, however, there wou d probably be an exodus of nearly
half the population if a water famine was in view, leaving
only about 300,000 persons to be served, there would be
about 20 gallons per head available for 200 days.
It is a pretty prospect that financial maladminis-
tration and other mismanagement has brought
within sight—the doling out of contaminated water
in famine quantities to the moiety of a half-aban-
doned city’s population.

Adelaide, where holy women are said to
parade the streets o’ nights accosting men with
the idea of “ testing their virtue,” is busy with
another social-purity discussion. For nearly 20
years the statues of Hercules and Venus (in the
“ altogether ”) have adorned the city. Now some
prurient minds have discovered that they are in-
decent, and want them removed—or “suitably
draped.” One correspondent to the Adelaide
papers, “Purity,” gives a remarkable scrap of
anatomical knowledge—
Our first parents were “ made in God’s image.” Much
of the likeness has been lost through sin ; and, in the
face of human nature as it is, not forgetting- its enemies—
the world, the flesh, and the devil —such indecency is not
calculated to help us to the position from which mankind
has fallen.
Knowing as much as he evidently does, “Purity”
should tell the world exactly to what extent
Adam and Eve differed in form from Hercules
and Venus, or from modern man and woman.
E. T. Smith, the Adelaide ex-brewer, who
has gone ’Ome in a sort of semi-official way to
represent Premier Jenkins, as it were, at the
coronation, is probably fated to enjoy himself
more than any other gentleman on the job. Smith
revels in “loyalty,” he does. He got his little
bauble years ago when he was Mayor of Adelaide,
and his first glow of satisfaction was hot upon him
when he discovered that the “silver wedding ” of
the present King and Queen would fall due in
another month or two. Whereupon he rushed
round to the telegraph-office and wired to Mayor
Bingey Benjamin of Melbourne (who had also been
lately bebaubled) exhorting him to show his love
for the Throne by doing something. They both of
them did something, especially Smith. If The
Bulletin remembers aright they worried their
future monarch and monarchess with some article
of value and an illuminated address—something
that the Royal Pair were probably expected to
glance at before passing it into stock.

The Melbourne Tramway Co. (dividend

and valued employee recently—one Edward
M'Donough. He had been with the co.
almost from its inception, but having suffered
some years ago from a paralytic stroke, lie lost
his nerve and became unfit for work. So in the
end he lost his billet, and Melbourne Tramway

pension system or provident fund for worn-out
employees, M'Donough provided for himself a
week later with a long rope and a sudden drop.

Victoria, which can find money for bonuses
to well-paid Jenkinses, still gaols its sick and

sentenced to six months at S. Melbourne for the

she was ill and hard-up; while a day or two later
magistrate Panton awarded the same punishment
to a decrepit old derelict who had been found

the while the city’s parsons were gathering in lost
souls by the ton at Simultaneous Missions.

At the tile-making and pottery works of
Goodlet and Smith, Merrylands (N.S.W.) women
and girls are now employed at tile-dressing, work
previously done by lads. The firm had, some
time ago, trouble from a strike of the boys, so
girls were introduced. But the toil is too
arduous for young women; a portion of the work
consists of wheeling barrows; the dust, which
continually floats through the buildings must
have an injurious effect on the lungs; and, in the
cold weather, the wind that strikes through the
building will be severely felt. Is. this the
beginning of Cradley Heath in Australia?

flesh that had once been a human heart, and from
which protruded an accusing steel fork —the
spike on which the murderer may yet be impaled.

Canon Pain, of Darlinghurst, Sydney, goes
to Gippsland (Vic.) as C.E. Bishop at £BOO a
year, something more than double his present
salary. The appointments, very frequent, of late,
of local C.E. clergymen to sees in Australia, don’t
yield the profits to hangers-on which appoint-
ments made in England do. The “tips” in
Australia for a traveller to a See rarely exceed
£lOO, and a thrifty man of Scotch religion may
escape with £2O. In England a new Bishop is
bailed up at every step. The Secretary of State
and the Attorney-General are the first to tap
him ; then Archbishop, deans and others levy.
Messengers innumerable “touch” him. The
“Petty Bag” chases him, and a officer called
“Half-Hide” hunts him. If not a man of
property he has to borrow to get into the Kingdom
of Bishops. Small comparatively as the costs are
in Auscralia, Bishops-designate even here have
before now followed up their first prayer for light
with a letter to some “ dear friend ” for a
temporary financial lift.

A colonel of the Commonwealth army was
called on at Melbourne, a few days ago, to show
cause why he shouldn’t contribute to the support
of his aged and destitute father who had just
obtained an old age pension of Bs. a week Some
cold, proud men, with an expensive uniform and
£9 a week salary, would rather have maintained
two aged fathers than argue the squalid matter
out in court, but the colonel struggled with the
matter at some length and wanted to go into the
question of the old man’s undeserving character.
The court, however, held that the venerable’s
alleged bad qualities were no reason why the com-
munity should support him, and made an order for
4s. a week.

A Victorian old age pensioner, having had
his allowance raised from 4s. to 6s. a week, was
proceeding homewards, rejoicing in the prospect
of the occasional smoke represented by the extra
25., when a stentorian voice recalled him. The
next pensioner on the list, having been casually
asked as to the whereabouts of his wife, had told
the Court she was just then living with the
previous applicant, whereupon a policeman ran
like the wind to fetch the previous applicant back,
and the Commissioner glared at the immoral old
reprobate, and, remarking that “he had no right
to keep another man’s wife,” promptly knocked off
the small increase. Yet the old man had sound
precedent. There have been respectable Vic-
torian State pensioners—Judges and the like —
who have kept other men’s wives, and some of
them didn’t stop at one or two. But the State
expects its old age annuitant to buy a halo with
his first week’s screw—and wear it. He mustn’t
drink or smoke, or be at all giddy : in fact, he is
pretty clearly given to understand that the sooner
he wears a real halo the better.

The Anglican and Presbyterian clergyman
of Mt. Morgan recently horrified the “ unco
guid ” by refusing to pray for rain, in the follow-
ing startling terms :
We regret most sincerely that Thursday has been set
apart by proclamation as a day of humiliation and prayer
for rain, and beg to intimate that we shall not hold any
special services on that day. ... If the drought is, as
we believe it to be, a visitation of God, on account of our
national sins, then let us, as a nation, first show some
evidence that we intend to give up our sins.
Surprisingly logical for a brace of parsons.
MOSMAN AND MILSON’S POINT TRAM.
TO THE EDITOR.
Sir, —The conduct of schoolboys on board the
steamers to and from Sydney connecting with these
trams is of moment. Busy men, worried by anxious
thought on important subjects, are daily driven half-
distracted by youngsters, who romp and shout all
over the decks, becoming rude and insolent on being
remonstrated with. Could not the Ferries Company
arrange that these boys, when riot under the control
of some adult, should be confined to one part of the
vessel, and be made by some slight supervision to
remain stationary and quiet during the trip ?
—Yours, etc., North Shore.
Save your tears, my gentle Jingo,
Blot the grief-drop ; —pray BE cool,
None of these are English Tommies
Gripped in gyves of Boer rule.
These be merely Mosman kiddies
On the ferry-boat to school.
FAIS CE QUE VOUDRA.

The summer season duty’s left behind us,
Life’s dull drab hue a little while has fled—
With this the only rule to hold or bind us,
Fais ce que voudra— thus the days are sped.
We stray in couples, where old Ocean’s breezes
Whisper sweet secrets to his shores that
dream —
We revel largely in illicit squeezes—
Fais ce que voudra is our law supreme.
The studded skies o’erhang a land enchanted,
Whose fairies whisper, “ Whereso’er you find
A kiss will do most good, there promptly plant it;
None wander here but they are also blind.
“ Heed not the rusty saws that preach of duty
(This is the hour when Mrs. Grundy snores) ;
Here, at the shrine of loving, laughing beauty,
Fais ce que voudra, and what wealth is yours !
“ Take this for most of joy and least of sorrow
Of all that Earth’s philosophers ha\ e taught
(Your girl to-day may be his girl to-morrow)
Fais ce que voudra and the rest is naught.”

The blind musician sentenced, at Sydney,
to penal servitude for life for trying to burn his
wife to death, had been under the eye of
the police for years as a ruffian and wife-beater.
A policeman who once arrested Bottrell had a

who kicked him in the stomach and battered him
badly with his fiddle. Bottrell always sang sacred

sympathy from the piously-inclined.

A nasty bit of reading from the Age :
A Ballarat miner working on “contract” —some mine-
owners now object to the term “ tributer,” as it is
indicative of a system of sweating—earned only 4s. during
the month which ended on Saturday last. During the
preceding four weeks his earnings did not total more than
25., and in Jan. and Feb. he made Bs. 6d. ; while in the
month which embraced Christmas and New Year he
received nothing for his toil in the bowels of the earth.
The unfortunate man has a wife and nine children to
provide for, and all are in a condition of semi-starvation.
Although following a laborious occupation, the tributer
himself has not tasted meat for nearly a month. The
last meal of meat which the family partook of consisted
of a sheep’s head and pluck. There are scores of tributers
in Ballarat in similar straits, but, like the man in ques-
tion (whose case came under the notice of the local
Ladies’ Clothing Society), they are hiding their poverty,
and would suffer on rather than solicit alms.
Some people do have luck ! A little while
ago, a wardsmaid at a N.S.W. country hospital
didn’t feel very well, and went to bed. Next day,
the wardsmaid’s room-mate “touched something
cold ” in a drawer, and she told the resident
surgeon. The resident surgeon asked the sick
wardsmaid where it was, and she said it was in a
box in the drawer; also, that it was alive, and
that she had cut its throat. It had been alive,
and its throat had been cut all right; and the
blood-stained scissors with which the horrible job
was done—she admitted all of it—were found
under her mattress. The ordinary jury, with the
ordinary untrained J.P.-coroner, sat on the
infant; and a verdict was found that the infant
“ died from wounds inflicted on its throat by its
mother”; and the young woman (no question of
“ temporary insanity ” or other - excuse being
raised) was committed for trial for murder. In a
few days, however, some clever young person in
the Crown Law office discovered that the un-
trained jury and the untrained J.P.-coroner
hadn’t said whether the mother had cut her baby’s
throat for fun or by accident or otherwise ; and
in consequence, the prosecution was dropped
through a crack there and then, and the lady, who
was turned out of gaol, has probably, by this time,
left for foreign parts.

Last meeting of the Sydney Andy
M'Guire A.N.A. discussed the difficulty the
association found in sweating the medical
men of the State, and then went on to
consider the establishment of a weekly news-
paper. One delegate declared a “first-class
journalist could be procured to edit the paper for
thirty shillings a week,” and that the whole ex-
penditure of the publication would be “about
three pounds a week.” From this A.N.A. idea
of how to cater for the alleged minds of its
members, the public can form a. pretty accurate
idea of the association’s liberality to those who
care for their carcases (they have got carcases).

Re breach of promise. Supreme Court of
Louisiana (U.S.) has just decided that the death
of either party is a breach, entitling survivor to
recover substantial damages from the estate ! Not
so foolish as it looks, either, seeing that an engage-
ment presumably contemplates marriage, upon
which he would have made a will in her favor; and
that, in fact, he would probably have made such a
will anyway, if death had only been known to be
imminent.
A Broken Hill jury, locked up for the
night in an unfinished ease, sent out for a set of
ping-pong. It was a tough case; and next even-
ing, after the summing up, the jury found them-
selves divided. When things looked hopeless
ping-pong was proposed again by a man who was
for acquittal. That broke down the opposition.
The twelve fell over one another in the rush to the
court-room. It was their only hope of escape.

Dear Bulletin.—l was much interested in
the reasons given by Sydney
Magistrate Isaacs (B. 12/4/’O2) for
dismissing at information under
the N.S.W. Liquor Act. The
idea that a law broken by a
magistrate, a judge, and a
Minister of Justice becomes,
therefore, of no effect, and
may be defied by any outsider
with impunity, suggests to
me great possibilities. Do
you think that some P.M.
and a Minister of the
| Crown could be induced to
I commit a burglary, while
' a Supreme Court Judge put
away the swag, thus making
the law a dead letter?—
Yours, Burglar Bill.

About time that somebody got to business
on Melbourne University. The evidence taken
so far by the commission of inquiry reveals a very
knock-kneed state of affairs. The Registrar swore
that the engineering school cost £2300 a year, and
for that sum turned out from six to ten bachelors
of engineering. In mathematics, £l6OO was spent
in educating 91 students. Further, he asserted
that the only school that paid its way was the
medical school. The Arts course, he said, had
fallen off, because there was no “bread and
butter” in it for anyone save teachers and clergy-
men. One of the clerks at the University swore
that he had been there 12 years, and that his
salary was £l2O a year. He was a married man
with one child.

One reads in the Melbourne newspapers
of an inquiry being held re the skilful book-keep-
ing of ex-Accountant Dickson, lately retired to
Melb. Gaol, or some similar health resort. But
nobody asks the one Dickson question worth
troubling about: How did Dickson get quit of the
heavy paper securities which were supposed to be
in his keeping ? Everybody knows that the un-
happy punter lost thousands to bookmakers.
What they would like to know is the history of
the stolen bonds.

One of the Melb. simultaneous-mission
howlers says that he “ hasn’t been able to put a
cigar or pipe in his mouth since he came to realise
that his body was the temple of the Lord.” A
(partially) converted rhymer sings :
There must be a lot more trouble brewing
at Melbourne Women’s Hospital, for Byron
Moore lately resigned his position on the com-
mittee, “ owing to pressure of other duties,” and
at the same time Mrs. David Syme retired from
the fray. The present state of affairs at the
W.H. invites questions as to why the manage-
ment proved satisfactory enough for so many
years. If it is all owing to the sex of the bosses, as
the male doctors would have one believe, how
comes it that the rival Queen Yic. Hospital,
organised and conducted entirely by women, has
been always well spoken of up to now ? Common-
sense assumes that two or three or four clawsome
cats have made all the mischief for the W.H.
committee, and will keep the pot boiling until
the tamer tabbies conspire to turn them out.
Australia is growing notorious for hospital rum-
pusses, conducted under the pettifogging patronage
of an intensely parochial press.
From the evidence of defendant (aged
about 70), in a Melbourne wife-maintenance case,
showing the futility of Love’s old dream (news-
paper report):
When he contemplated marriage, and was introduced
to complainant, he resolved to first endeavour to obtain
an insight into her character, and went to lodge with her.
(Great laughter.) But he made a great mistake. (Re-
newed laughter.) She took every care that he should see
her only at her best. She was perfect before marriage.
But, oh 1 what a change ! (Great laughter.) When wit-
ness came home, she would be muddled with drink. He
repeatedly told her that he had only two teeth left—(more
laughter)—and he wanted her to be most particular about
the meat. But she would always overcook it —(great
laughter)—apparently to annoy him. He could not eat
it. When he complained, on one occasion, she seized a
poker. He did not remonstrate with her. What was the
use of remonstrating against a poker ?
A GOOD ROUND FIGURE.
MAMA (to Julia's suitor): “ You are more than
old enough to be her father. And—excuse me
if I speak too plainly—your figure is not
likely to attract a young girl.”
THE SUITOR: “My figure! Why, what's the
matter with fifteen hundred a year? ”
The casual Australian again ! Three
employees at Perth (W.A.) sanitary depot were
lately brought up before the observing eye of the
law for neglecting to report the finding of an
infant’s body among the city garbage. Their
defence seems to have been, in a general way, that
things like that were always liable to turn up at
the destructor, and they hadn’t the least idea that
they were expected to report such matters. For
instance:
One witness stated that, on the night in question he
saw Girst carrying the infant’s body on a pitchfork into
the engine room, but he did not think any more about it.
It transpired that somebody remembered the
leg of a woman being also found among the
garbage and burnt, but he was loose about
the date, and no one seemed quite certain how
often women’s legs, or even whole women,
transpired. The man who burned the infant
said he “was used to burning all sorts of
garbage, ” and the infant had been shovelled in as
part of the ordinary routine. The three persons
Actively concerned in this mechanical pursuit of
duty were fined small sums, but unfortunately
nothing happened to the witness who thought no
more about it when he saw a dead body being
carried past on a pitchfork. It is painful to see an
unobservant person sunk in mental apathy, when a
fine of £1 might have wakened him up.

Sarcastic public notice from Melb. Age on
8-hours day:—
rpO-MORROW. —The Greek oyster merchants in
-*- Melbourne will for the first time celebrate their
Eighteen Hours day.
For sheer brutality, the Melbourne hos-
pitals just now would be hard to beat. The
Women’s Hospital has shown how absolutely
callous it can be to the sufferings of women, and
Melbourne Hospital seems to be following suit
with much vigor. Recently a laborer hobbled
into the City Court on crutches, and in awful
Sain. He is 51 years of age, and on the day before
rood Friday he fell in the street and broke his
leg. He was taken to Melb. Hospital and treated
during less than three weeks. Then he was fitted
with crutches, and, having a few shillings in his
pocket, was hustled into the street. A day after-
wards he was found by a constable terribly ill, and
his leg so bad that he was unable to walk. As the
man was quite helpless, the magistrate sent him
to the #ao(-hospital.

A lawyer of versatile habits put up a
remarkable performance in a Maoriland court a
week or two ago. He was engaged to
appear for (say) Miss Smith who had
“gone wrong” and had a baby, and
who wanted affiliation money and con-
finement-expenses. In the same court
waiting for her case to come on was (say)
Mrs. Jones who wanted judicial separa-
tion from her husband by reason of
incompatibility of temper while in
liquor or something of the kind. Miss
Smith was out of the court when she
was called. Mrs. Jones mistook the
husky utterance of the court official
for her own name and fled into the
box. Then the lawyer, who had never
seen his client or else forget what she
was like, demanded particulars as to
the birth of her child, amount of
medical charges &c., and Mrs. Jones,
who had a child and who was rushed
off her feet by the tumultuous
lawyer, gave the facts and won-
dered what they had to do
with the case. The court,
in a tired perfunctory way,
gave judgment for
confinement ex’s
and the usual
i 7s. 6d. a week,
\ and Mrs. Jones,
J informed that
Y she had won, de-
f parted in great
bewilderment
at the manner
of it. When her
own case came
on she had gone
home, and it was
struck out for non-
appearance. Time
rolled on, and Miss
Smith, hanging about
outside, almost per-
ished on her feet with
weariness. T hen
these people got to-
gether and ex-
plained things, so
far as they could
be explained, which
wasn’t far. A court
which just wakes up
now and then to reach
a ready-made judg-
ment down off the
shelf, and doesn’t
mind much whether
it is an affiliation
order or a judicial separa-
tion, will do something
interesting one of these days.

♦
The huge strikes in Belgium, with ructions coming
close up to civil war, are a warning against putting
frills on an electoral system. Belgium is the
place where they give you a vote for being a man,
and another for being 35 and living with a family
(sanctioned by the Church) in a house that pays
five francs tax, and another for being 25 and
drawing 100 francs interest a year from the Bel-
gian Savings Bank, and another for having a
University certificate, and another for several
other things which this paper hasn’t time to
specify. You may not use more than three votes,
though; but if you don’t use these, gaol may be
prescribed. Also there is a scheme of pro-
Ejrtional representation. The men of the
abor, or Socialist, party say that the frills are
no doubt very pretty; but as practically all of
them are on one political side, the others might as
well be naked for all the good their little vote
without frills does them. The Clerical reply is
that Intellect and a Stake in the Country must
count before Brawn ; to which Brawn replies as it
most effectively can—by knocking off work for a
few days, and asking Intellect and the Stake how
they like the look of things. And all on account of
the frills —which is something Q. Premier Philp
might find worth remembering.
OPHELIA.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
As I looked on her sorrow-soft eyes,
And her brow,
Clouded now,
That once had been bright as the skies—
I said to my heart: “ Poor, sweet dove,
She has been disappointed in love ! ”
As I looked on her chin, childish-weak,
And her lips,
Thin red strips,
Passionless, mirthless and meek—
My heart said to me : “ Nay, good sir,
Love has been disappointed in her / ”
P F.R.
I send no smoke up-curling to the stars,
And my body is a Temple unprofaned,
For a spirit has descended and explained
That his weakly stomach heaves
More than mind of man conceives
When he smells the horrid odor of cigars.
The blandishment of wine is not for me,
Nor, equally, the blandishment of beer
(Soft tack only is allowed to enter here) :
I must never take a skinful
Of the whisky of the sinful—
Let me wash this solemn Temple out with tea.
Yet my mind is racked with agonising doubt,
And with tremulous foreboding when I dine,
Dropping fish and Irish stew into the Shrine ;
For beans upon the floor
Just inside the Temple door
Are matters that I have my fears about.
No Temple should have meat upon its walls,
Lungs and casual things like that a-hanging up,
And coffee washing round as in a cup.
And where all is pure and holy
There should not be common, lowly
Bacon falling from above into the halls.
O man, view thine own contents for a space.
They are untidy, baggy things and strings
(Of such are pontiffs, emperors and kings)
And undigested food
In melancholy mood
Stalks, ghostlike, up and down the sacred plaee.
This place is not a Temple—not by miles—
This transient, brief receptacle for eggs
That’s borne around by two pale weary legs ;
And Indigestion drear
Is the only spirit here,
Roaming, unburied, in these shadowed aisles.

A WOMAN’S LETTER.
Sydney, April 29, 1902.
Mt Dear Arint.—
One Whittier, a poet by trade,has written—“the
meal unshared is food unblessed.” If it be true,
so ought to be the converse, and hence the dinner
to Mr. Barton was a greatly blessed meal. The
Town Hall was decorated with the good old flag
and pot-plant properties. Five hundred guests
sat down. The chief table wore a wavy wreath of
ivy leaves, and cauliflowery chrysanthemums
were here and there. Towards 7.30 guests
began to arrive in knots, in squads, in companies,
until presently there was an army of black-and-
white men, every one of whom seemed to be
eagerly seeking a long-lost brother, and to find
him every half-yard. Such an affectionate body
of men—for an ante-dinner crowd ! They held
each other’s hands or elbows whilst whispering
Cabinet secrets, and laid hands on each other’s
shoulders. Some of the younger men strolled in
with both hands in pockets, and a mighty affecta-
tion of nonchalance. These were playing to the
galleries, packed with squaws. A few men came
in hurriedly, made their way through the crowd
as if through brambles and briars, went straight to
theirplaces, sat down and looked bored and hungry.
Enter Eiffel-Tower Dibbs, with the K.C.M.G.
bauble on his neck ; then John Forrest, a ribbon
across his shirt-front and a jewel over his heart ;
then the Guest, escorted by the Mayor of Sydney
in his official robes. A burst of band-music
and of clapping ; one original extended his
arms and waggled his fingers at the Guest,
after the fashion of the Daphne-worshippers
in the late lamented “Ben Hur.” Then the
Guest was seated with Forrest, Hughes, Wise and
Fysh for near neighbors. All the gentlemen at
this table save Mr. Wise looked like presidents of
cattle - clubs, and had “Advance Australia”
figures. To the strains of a dashing march Mr.
Barton began to eat oysters off the shell. The
menu, copies of which were distributed with
packets of sweets amongst aforesaid squaws in
the gallery, showed the dinner to be a splendid
one —on paper.t
I heard afterwards that rminy of the guests got
nothing to eat but bread and cheese ; others stayed
their appetite with Charlotte Russe, loaf-sugar or
whatever happened to be in the vicinity. Food
was plentiful, but so was the lack of attendance.
One unfed gentleman took his expensive “meal ”
lightly but is very bitter about the number of men
required to respond to the Parliamentary toast.
“Four persons to respond to the toast of Parlia-
ment,” he exclaimed, “ now if they had employed
40 persons to curse it ”
At 8.30 the eating ceased, but drinking went on
and every man had a cigar in his face. A girl told
me, that an authority had told her, that you can
always tell a bounder by the fact of his not
removing the band from his cigar before he
smokes. Well, nearly every man retained that
sash on his weed. “My friends, Sir John Forrest
and Sir Philip Fysh will reply to this toast,” said
the Guest, and sat down. No man who had much
more than smelt the cork of the “ Irroy” could say
Philip Fysh twice quickly without falling over
the alliteration, but the Guest said it as
plainly as I write it. Then big John F. spoke at
length, every word as distinct as his personality.
After that the guests started conversation on
their own account. When the diners were at the
dessert there was a ‘ ‘ sensation ” in the southern
gallery. Down into the reserved seats stepped
the Mayoress, Mrs. Hughes, in one of her second-
best frocks, blue and white; Mrs. Barton, in
black, with a big black velvet bow on her organ
of veneration ; Lady Forrest, in white and black,
with violets on her shoulder-straps; Mrs. See,
Lady Fysh, Mrs. D. Mackenzie, and a number of
other ladies who might be classed as “ sundries.”
Thick-voiced speakers killed the time, and it was
10.30 when Mr. Barton rose to reply to the toast
of “Our Guest,” but everyone, squaws and
braves, were weary and half-asleep; besides, there
weren’t many of the former left, and Mr. Barton’s
reference to the Franchise Bill just passed gave
no electric shock to the galleries. The nows was
three days old, but it was evidently the first that
many present had heard of it. It was long after
11 before the band banged out “ God Save.”
A doctor’s marriage to a doctor has given variety
to the Sydney weddings of the week. The bride-
groom, Dr. R. Hardman, is a son of Mr. R. Hard-
man, of Enmore, the biscuit manufacturer; the
bride is Dr. Ada Affleck, of Innisfallen, Manly,
and was professionally engaged at the Coast
Hospital. A phalanx of nurses was present at the
ceremony, and at the reception a host of doctors
wished the happy pair good luck. Women doctors
usually marry into their own profession when
they do marry, and none of the women doctors
are old enough to have it said of them that they
don’t marry. It is said Dr. Hardman and his
wife intend to give up medicine, both of them,
the bridegroom taking to biscuits and the bride to
domestic happiness.
London correspondent of a local daily is gratui-
tously horrid over Miss Lilian Copeland’s presen-
tation at Court. “ Miss Copeland was presented
by Mrs. Chamberlain, which, of course, means,
not that Mrs. Chamberlain personally introduced
her to the King, but that Mrs. Chamberlain
vouched for her respectability. As a matter of
fact, Miss Copeland never even saw Mrs. Cham-
berlain the whole evening.” Why this offensive
particularity, anyhow ? Is it Miss Copeland or
Mrs. Chamberlain who wants to avoid too close
association ?
You recollect the rosy, broadly-smiling, bux-
som Daisy Belmore, of the Barrett Co., who took
: the parts of Lady Dacia in “The Sign of the
Cross ” and the serving wench in “ King Alfred.”
She married in Melbourne last week a Mr. Wax-
man, brother to Albert Whelan, the mimio who
has made a name in London.
Signor Steffani has set up as a voice-trainer and
developer in London, and has extensive advts. in
the papers. Madame Minna Fischer, one of Amy
Castles’ teachers, who will be remembered in
opera by Australian theatre-goers of 10 years
ago, has a son just back from the war who pro-
mises to make a little name for himself as a
writer and artist. Leonard Flemming (Madame
Fischer was the wife of Herbert Flemming, the
actor, now with the co. in S’Africa) had the
curious luck to come, with one other, unscathed
out of an action in which his detachment, num-
bering 30, had a fiery time. Of the 30, 28 were
either killed or wounded. Further news from
London says that Miss Grace Joel, a M.L. girl,
who studied in Melbourne Gallery and in Paris,
has set up a studio there. I remember a flower-
§iece of Miss Joel’s —a study of roses—in a local
ociety of Artists’ show some years ago. Those
roses had souls, and their mother was the sunset.
The M.L. tenor, Mr. Tom Jackson, who gave up
law for song, is shortly to be married to a Miss
Foxcroft, who is also of the professional musical
world, and is said to be young and pretty.
Miss Balgarnie, the visiting temperance lecturer,
made her final speech on a subject quite off the
reforming track. It had naught to do with evils,
wrought by the juice of the grape or distilled
grain, or with womanhood suffrage, but “Joan of
Are,” illustrated by limelight views of the maid in
armour, of her statues, of the streets and bridges-
over which she and her soldiers passed. There
was a good audience of men, women and children,
and all of the lecture would have been heard if
some he-oflicial hadn’t walked about the hall in
creaky boots from the time Jeanne came up from,
her sheep-keeping to the moment when
burning at the stake, she called for ‘ ‘ water, holy
water.” Miss Balgarnie, a stout, brown-haired
lady, much better-looking than her published por-
traits, recited her story in simple narrative
form like a schoolmistress addressing a junior
class. Whether her subject be beer, suffrage, or
martyred maids, there is never any attempt at
elocutionary effects. If it were not for the
“ Angels who came into the prison-cell to comfort
Jeanne” and the “Inspirations from on high,”
you might call it a round, unvarnished tale. But
these made the varnish. We all love angels and
inspirations, but when you get them mixed with
history (whilst the electric trams roar without, and'
the telephone bell rings within) don’t you find
your very toes curling with impatience ? Jeanne
was tied to her wooden bed ; she had no woman
near her ; she was watched day and night by coarse
soldiery, and given no change of garments ; yet an
angel visited the damsel to comfort her. If he
didn’t break the necks of the Tommies or
cut the maid’s bonds, he at least might
have loaned her his wings. Go to 1 Perhaps
the horrors as well as the varnish are false,
as history mostly is. Let us pray that Jeanne
eloped in the night with the captain of the guard,
and in a far, sweet spot lived a happy life of love
and vine-growing, and that that which was burnt
and which the Roman Pontiff is now about to
canonise, was only the sawdust and shavings of an
effigy.
The triumph of time: When the lecturess sat
down after her recital of a woman’s persecution
by men, a telegram was put into her hand. She
read it aloud. It was to Miss Scott, and set forth
that the Woman’s Suffrage Bill had passed the
House of Representatives. I should nave liked
to have questioned Miss Balgarnie about the
advisability of introducing a Bill for the propaga-
tion of phylloxera as an aid to the abolition of
drink; in (fact, I did venture something feeble
about what she would do with the vine-growing
industry, and she made reply about there being no
need to make wine of the grapes.
Janet Waldorf’s Juliet was a sweet thing in the
portrayal of the unsophisticated maid, the passion-
ate wife, and distraught widow. The American
Juliet had all the physical qualifications for the
part and her one fault was assumed—the “ old,”
deep voice which she affected for the purpose of
shading her lighter tones. The alteration was so
jarring—like a big bass drum breaking in upon the
strains of a flute. Mrs. Ada Currie ought to
make her pretty and gifted pupil say “boundless ”
instead of “boned-less,” and “wherefore” instead
of “whawfor.” Mrs. Brown-Potter had this
awful pronunciation wherever the ou occurred.
She also did the voice-out-of-the-barrel trick.
Miss Lane looked her Yeronese-picture part, and
played the unnatural mother naturally. Mr. H.
H. Vincent’s Mercutio was exactly what Mer-
cutio ought to have been, but in all probability
the real Mercutio was nothing so splendid.
Pale eau-de-nil and mauve orchid tints and
nasturtium shades are being used in millinery in a
way that is a trifle ahead of Nature herself. The
hats, dress-trails, and furs at Messrs. David Jones
and Co. are warranted to make you experience
des Emotions. One of the first has a long spray of
pale green skeleton leaves and a lot of chastened
Parma violets on a furry ground, the kind of gear
a fourteen-year-old Juliet might wear. Fifty
per cent, of imported hats carry birds, but most
Sydney women who buy these have the fowl
removed, and something that was always still-life
substituted. Loyalty to the wishes of Royalty, I
suppose! Dress trails of flowers, butterflies,
whisps of chiffon, and birds are waiting for some-
one, but the toniest are, I am told, of huge pearl
cherries, jessamine leaves, and some black Vir-
ginia creeper. Carracul and silvered fox are hot
favorites for cold days, and no one who calls her-
self a lady will be without a coat or muff plun-
dered from some pretty beastie.
Newbury-Spada 00. will begin a short season of
“Pops” at Centennial Hall next Saturday. As
Sydneysiders have proved themselves so tenor-
hungry during the last year they can now go
Newburying and take their fill of what Dani has
not got quite the monopoly.
On May 7, Miss Maud Fitz-Stubbs will begin a
series of musical afternoons, at which brilliant and
popular programmes will be presented.
Writes my Melbourne correspondent:—
“Ever so many weddings on the same day
(April 23rd) as Miss Harper’s. At St. Colomb’s,
Hawthorn, the sister of big, red-haired, loose-
jointed Bishop Armstrong, was joined in the
bonds to Rev. Law, formerly curate of Hawthorn,
now incumbent of North Melbourne. The wed-
ding of the day was Miss May Harper’s. The
bride is the only surviving daughter of Robert
Harper, M.H.R. Her only sister died
at 15, of fever, at Rome, where she was
sojourning with her relatives in the course of
a Continental tour. Her bereaved parents
returned at once to Australia, with their child’s
coffin, and never again want to see foreign parts.
The former Miss Harper, now Mrs. Taylor, is a
dark, handsome, lively girl. Her mother, dark
and handsome too, is a daughter of the late Rev.
Dr. Cairns, and works off her superfluous energy
and love of rule (inherited from her father)
in endless church and charitable work,
but at the same time keeps herself well
to the fore in sassiety. ‘Dear Lady Loch,’
described Mrs. Harper as ‘the most lady-like
woman in Melbourne,’ and even the haughty
Countess remembered to send along a wedding
present to Mrs. Harper’s daughter. Dr. Cairns’
only son died young, and of his five daughters,
all well married, only Mrs. Harper and Mrs.
Suetonius Officer survive. Robert Harper’s new
son-in-law, Mr. Taylor, is a scion of the clan,
which owned, among other pastoral properties,
Euston Station, on the Murray.
“Mrs. Robert Harper was one of the few
selected to pump-handle Royalty in May last,
while at least 50 ‘ greater ’ somebodies—in the
Social sense—stood by and chewed the cud of
chagrin. Ever since then Mrs. H. has tried to
live up to that situation. The marriage of
daughter May with Mr. Alf. Taylor, on Wednes-
day last, was an occasion on which she (usually
thrifty) let herself go in the matter of dress and
decoration, and did her maternal best to eclipse
all the most swagger knot-tyings of this self-
advertising centre. The Presbyterian Church,
Toorak, right opposite ‘Myoora,’ the Harpers’
home, bristled with palms, white chrysanthemums,
roses, and dahlias. Hearts on wire rests (the
irony of it!) doves cradled on arches, and wedding
bells balancing on decorated masts, were features
of that floral scene. Up in the front pews sat
Better-Not-Wally with Mrs. Corbet. To the side
was the affable State Governor’s wife (in blue)
with her daughter and Aide Baby Browning.
Sassiety cream was concentrated within a pre-
scribed area marked ‘ Guests.’
“ Miss Harper, as a bride, proved pretty. She
never before dressed her social part so smartly as
this. Satin underskirts, iridescent with silver
sparklets, had a delicate veiling of real lace.
(Mrs. Harper is one of our keenest lace-working
promoters.) Four good-figured maids stood
to the bride —Miss Nora Dangar (Sydney),
Miss Raleigh, Miss Violet Bede, and Miss
Anderson. Their expensive frocks of French
grenadine over chiffon and glace were simply
made, and hats decorated in Limerick lace and
autumn leaves seemed scarcely large or pictur-
esque enough for such flowing frocks. Lady
Braddon, with her toque skewered straight this
time, had her patent smile on. The Tasmanienne
beams impartially, and not in the least particu-
larly, on the world. Mrs. George Chirnside
shimmered in cream and gold. Lady Madden,
pale from her recent resurrection from the Frank-
ston cloister, mothered her pet lamb —Ruby—and
rather chilled off the Naicest. The plump and
pink charmer in blue spoilt a pretty outfit by the
steeple of rigid, uncompromising aigrette in the
front of her toque. Lady Clarke drove away
after the ceremony, leaving her olive-branch to
walk up the gravelled path of Myoora, with the
cherub of an Aide. Wally walked, too, with the
debonnair Mrs. Corbet.
“Another smart bride, with a little London
experience, took herself and her maids to Mel-
bourne’s swell dress-builder, to be slipped into
their complete outfit in the much-mirrored rooms
on the eventful day. Half-a-dozen smart ‘ hands ’
tended to help, and succeeded in turning out the
most perfectly-gowned bridal party Melbourne
has seen since Mrs. Claude Macdonald produced
her stage bridal pictures at St. Paul’s Cathedral.
“ Quite a boom in Melbourne press marriages.
Since Easter no fewer than three have occurred,
leader-writer Hoare, of the Age, re-tying the
nuptial knot, and L. V. Biggs, municipal news-
getter of the same paper, and “Tom” Brennan,
of the Argus sub-editorial staff, also venturing.
The average pressman enters matrimony unosten-
tatiously, and casually mentions that he has taken
unto himself a ‘ missus ’ a few weeks or months or
years after the deed is done. All three of those
mentioned, however, went in for solemn church
ceremonials, widespread invitations, and wedding-
presents. The press is growing altogether too
stylish. Apropos , a famous Australian pressman
once told me: ‘When I was getting married I
said nothing about it to anyone except an old
public-house landlady who had somehow got an
inkling of what was in the wind, and put the
question to me straight. ‘ I hope you’ll be happy
my boy; here’s a wedding present for you’—
handing me the corkscrew with which she had
just opened a bottle for me. Alas ! It was the
most calamitous omen that ever came to a man in
the guise of a friendly offering.’
“At Metropolitan Liedertafel concert (Anri]
22) their minor Excellencies, the Clarkes, man-
aged to look pleasant all the evening. Trim, bald
button-nosed Pa turned on a duty smile, like a
good little man, whenever the good example of hia
better-half’s unflagging graciousness stimulated
him to fresh spurts of imitative affability. ‘ Her-
self,’ with waved silvery locks, brushed softly
back and twined in neat rear-coils, lent a touch of
height to her coiffure by aigrettes of mauve
chiffon mounted on satin rosettes of the same
color. Her neighbour at the concert was
spare, spectacled Dame Sargood, in low-
necked black gown and tiptop conversational
form. Not quite so many hoary members of the
‘ Metropolitan ’ choir as formerly ; the ‘ bearded
wheat ’ is thinning out, I suppose. There was a
time when the society scarcely got off a concert
without a dirge or elegy, in memory of some
departed warbler, promoted to celestial choirs.
“Melbourne Metrop. Liedertafel made an
attempt to place another Bendigo Castles before
the world last week in the person of Miss Beatrice
English, daughter of a member of the foorcein
the city of prodigies. Miss English has a fine
large voice, with a fair ring of quality, but it has
been subjected too long to the severe treatment
which Amy Castles had to endure ere making her
first Melb. bow and being ‘discovered’ by so
many people. She sings with the open chest
voice right up to the top, and it is painful to hear
her try for notes high up, and just get them by
the skin of her teeth. There is none of that soft
purring quality behind the “ ring ” which is Amy
Castles’ chief merit, but Miss English used to beat
Amy every time in A.N.A. and other competi-
tions, where it appears to be the duty of the
budding soprano to make as much noise as she can
if she wishes to scoop the prizes.
“The Liedertafel itself did its share of the
programme in good, solid fashion. The musicians
(mostly Teutonic) of the string quartette sounded
far more artistic than they looked. Tenor Gregor
Wood was regarded rather wistfully by spinster-
hearers. He’s soon to pass into what is, to a
tenor, nothingnes— i.e. , matrimony—in conjunc-
tion with Miss Allie Mattiason. Organist Fentum,
still detached, awakes a spark of maiden interest,
though even young, hopeful damsels couple hit
bachelorhood with that of violinist Curtis, as
almost too confirmed for cure.
“In William Snowball, M. 8., who died last
week, aged 47, Melbourne has lost the first and
most widely-known of its baby-doctors. Mr.
Snowball’s reputation as a specialist in the treat-
ment of infantile diseases was legitimately earned.
Other practitioners—men and women—could pre-
scribe exactly what he prescribed in nine cases
out of ten, but he was the oracle who knew what
to do and what not to do in the tenth case.
Nothing of the alarmist about him. Snowball
devoted much of his brains and experience to
discovering satisfactory reasons for ‘ oddness ’ in
children. He was the court of appeal for anxious
mothers whose babies had been, perhaps, roughly
misjudged by the family doc. They went to
Snowball with their hopes and fears, and came
away minus the fears. The death of Mr. Snow-
ball is a national loss.
“ A casual visit to the Federal House, the other
night, provided some thoughtful study. Alfred
Deakin, on the verge of being nominated as the
temporary substitute of the Prime Minister,
talked at lightning speed to three members. The
black-whiskered Minister, alert as a terrier, skipped
from one Senator to another, answering, criticis-
ing, and adding comment in lightning flashes. In
one of the corridors, Senator R. E. O’Connor
stalked up and down, up and down in tireless
fashion. Outside the refreshment lobby,. Boss
Barton sat—a worried, troubled figure, ink and
paper before him, a clerk at his side, indecision in
his attitude. In the refreshment rooms, John
Forrest entertained an hilarious coffee-party of his
wife’s friends. In the Chamber itself, the
Woman’s Franchise Bill engaged the consideration
of Minister Lyne, who vapidly, woodenly, maunders
on to his regardless brethren about the rights of
lovely woman. Erect and solitary on the Minis-
terial bench sits the long, lean Fysh ; he wears the
look of the righteous publican at a church service.
The broad-girthed Knox looks round at the visi-
tors’ gallery and smiles engagingly at the fair
franchise agitators. He passes the wink along,
till three or four other Federal loungers look and
laugh too. Miss Locke, in Vida Goldstein’s old
place, in the commanding corner of the gallery, is
the one absorbed listener. She is very grave,
visibly impressed with her leadership of the
franchisites. A few other casual girl visitors are
soon disgusted at the tame proceedings, and rustle
out. The Reps, at any time are not ladykillers.
“There was a big wedding-party at a Mel-
bourne theatre one recent evening. It turned up
in all its finery, bouquets, special dresses, and all
the pomp and circumstance of a glorious match.
The whole party left long before the conclusion of
the last act —and a rude gallery laughed up-
roariously.
“The venerable Duncan Gillies tip-toed his
way into a box at Her Majesty’s last Saturday
night with the Scotch balladist, Maggie M‘Cann,
and her married sister. Duncan grows more like
a dried Mildura apricot every day—the color of
that preserved dainty extending over the furrowed
face and round the hairless head. The venerable
legislator very often gives these dinners and.
theatre parties to friends.
Yours affectionately,
AKENEHI.

A member of Parliament, called as a wit-

trate, and business proceeded.
Premier Seddon explains that it was a
certain Maori chief, one Waipere, who made the
sanguinary remarks alleged to have been made by
him (Bun Tuck) at Papawai. The Bulletin is
prepared to believe that it was the Maori chief
Waipiro (which is another name for whisky) who
made the remarks in question.

It is whispered that one of the Australian

by routine office work. Folk in positions of that
kind should be cautious ; so many persons hanker
after the reversion of their billets.
If Sydney University Senate “ sacks ” Pro-
fessor Wood it will naturally force Oxford Univer-

Oxford, where the lords come from.

Nearly 30 years ago Miss Stuart, a niece
of Alex. Stuart who became N.S.W. Premier
afterwards, delivered in London a speech on
women’s f anchise, which, on being sent by Mr.
Stuart to the late Henry Parkes, is said to have
converted him to the principle ; not indeed to the
principle of women’s franchise in itself, but to the
belief in its inevitableness. Parkes often ex-
pressed the hope that Miss Stuart would gain a
seat in the Commons. A badly disappointed
hope.
“ On the Spot ” to The Bulletin :
Re the sacrilegously-named S’African “ Patriotic
Scouts”—Vilonel, who took upon himself the formation
of this corps of Free Staters, lived in the Senekal district
and was a general law-agent, his partner being one
Kitchener. At the beginning of the war he was tried for
treason and locked up at Winburg. When this town was
entered by the British he was set free. Most of these
“ National ” or “ Patriotic ” scouts are of the same kidney
and in no way indicate the feeling of the mass of the
people in the two republics. Vilonel is simply inspired
by personal animosity.
“ A.P.” on the Rhodes bequests :
The late “ Colossus ” of S’Africa has bequeathed the
better part of 12 million pounds to further Imperial
schemes. Where is the £12,000,000 to come from ? The
bulk of the Rhodes estate consists of real property
in Rhodesia and Cape Colony. Well, his Rhodesian
lands (millions of acres) are now absolutely un-
saleable, and must continue to be unrealisable
(except at enormous loss) for years to come. As for
personalty, I am willing to bet that it will be found to
fall short of a million in cold cash. Did Rhodes make his
will before the war—when he actually was, on paper at
least, a multi-millionaire ; or did he—always an expert
self-advertiser—contrive the instrument on his death-
bed, in a spirit of grim jest ?
Anglican Canon Green, of Glenelg (S.A.),

ecause they did not consent to keep the Friday
of every week sacred, in memory of the Cruci-
fixion. It was the Canon who absolutely, by his
own exertions, ended a disastrous strike at Port
Adelaide a few years ago, and his eccentricities
are overlooked in favor of His real strength of
character.

Ex-Governor Beauchamp has not forgotten
N.S.Wales. He lately sent out to Mr. J. W.

considerable literary talent was brought under the
Earl’s notice a little while before he left Sydney.
Crick and Eden George were not the first

Sydney, if he won. The difference between the
transactions was that Crick and Eden George
lost, whereas his Ex. won, and paid over the pro-
mised amount.
“Exit May Yohe from the Peerage

ings Co. In ’93 she fairly took London by storm
in burlesque, and in ’94 married Lord Francis
Hope. She was then a lovely American brunette
(she was said to have Indian blood in her veins).

London Spectator publishes these verses
as a death-bed contribution by Arthur Patcbett-
Martin, an old Melbcurnite whom many Aus-
tralians well remember, and who lately died at
Teneriffe:
A reporter (who may be inaccurate as to a
word or two) gives this version of a distinguished
Era Pay describing how he rescued a lady from
drowning:—
As Oi stood on the say shore watching the cruel but
lovely waves stirred boy Neptune’s moighty brreath,
Oi behild with anguished hearrrt a drame of fa.vmale love-
liness in imminent peril and danger-r of foinding a war-
terry grave. To ploonge in was the wurruk of a second,
and to draw from the cruel arrums of the say that lovely
lady the most prrecious privilege of my existence—
&c., &c.
Old David Mitchell, Melba’s father, makes
no secret nowadays about his admiration for
daughter Nellie. He was noticeable among those
who went to hear Amy Castles in Melbourne,
incited thereto by the comparisons made between
the famous soprano and the young girl who is just
bidding for elbow-room among the ilite. Asked
afterwards what he thought of Amy, old man
Mitchell could not conceal his pride in the dis-
obedient child who carved her way in spite of his
prohibition.
Another chapter in De Rougemont’s
strange career was entered upon at Parramatta
(N.S.W.) police court, the other day, when his
wife sued him for maintenance. It was a sorrow-
ful tale of misery—a poor, sick woman and hungry
children depending for their very thin bread and
butter on the few shillings a week occasionally
earned by their unhappy, careworn father at
life-assurance canvassing. The public might with
grace give a few pounds to this family: The
Bulletin will give a donation.
The South Australian Jenkins has done a
foolish thing. He did not exactly write a book
to gratify and satisfy a Scriptural enemy. He
did worse. He wrote an autobiographical letter
to one Lyon, of Guelph, Ontario. The de-
lighted Lyon, in the pride of .his heart, carried
it to the printer, and now Jenkins’ vainglorious
screed appears in cold type in the columns of an
Ontario daily. There is nothing reticent about
the letter. Such a document, if published just
before a general election, would make any Jenkins
sit up.
That clever and popular American artist,
Fred. B. Schell, who left Australia for New York
to take up the art-editorship of the Harper publi-
cations, and, after doing some years’ excellent
work, was compelled to retire on account of hope-
less illness, can now, many Australians will much
regret to hear, hardly manage to totter across his
room. His trouble is paralysis, from which his
nearest friend, Dr. Morrison, of “ Men of Mark ”
fame, died the other day. Miss Morrison, by the
way, is the wife of that well-beloved actor, Charles
Arnold.
A forgotten Premier of S.A. is Henry-
Bull Templer Strangways, who, being called to
the English Bar when 24 years old, went to Ade-
laide, and at 26 was elected to the local Parlia-
ment ; at 27 had the chance of forming a Govern-
ment, but declined, and at 28 became a subordinate
Minister. He resigned as head of a Cabinet in
1870, almost immediately afterwards returning
to England, where he has remained ever since.
He is only 70 years old, but if he is ever men-
tioned in S.A. it is as a man who flourished before
the Flood. He is chiefly held in esteem as the
author of the Act which created agricultural areas
in S.A., and permitted the sale of Crown lands
on credit.
Apropos the Vic. alleged reform move-
ment, Taverner, M.L.A., looking for the Premier
at the height of the fuss, asked Peacock’s police-
orderly whether “Mr. Goddard ” was in. “Who?”
interrogated the mystified protector of the Smiler.
“Mr. Goddard,” said Taverner. “I don’t know
any Mr. Goddard,” answered the minion ; “ he’s
not in this building.” “Perhaps I’m mistaken,”
remarked Taverner; “you see, I’ve been away
for the last week or two, and I understood there
had been a change of Govt. Who’s Premier now
—Peacock or Goddard?” “Well,” drawled the
orderly, “ I’m not exactly sure myself, but if it’s
any Treasury matter you’ve come about, I think
the best plan would be to see Mr. G. D. Meudell.”
The pen lies heavy to my hand,
My eyes are faint and dim—
There in the mirror as I stand,
How lustreless their rim 1

A phantom visage of the Land of Shades ;
And I had marked so many things to do,
So many things undone !
The priest declared my moments were too few ;
The doctor —I had none I
I dashed the mirror to the floor,
I spurned my best-lov&d book,
I opened wide God’s eastward door
To take my last long look !
And lo ! the mirror and the book were there,
And I betwixt them, kneeling as in prayer,
While all the many things I’d marked to do —
And all the things undone—
Seemed by God’s gracious mercy light and few,
And priest and doctor gone !
A New Sydney Daily Paper.
The prospectus of the co. which it is proposed to
form for the purpose of founding a new paper in
Sydney is now in preparation—for private circu-
lation only. Supposed sympathisers with the
project have, however, been canvassed for some
time past, so far (we learn on good authority) with
very discouraging results indeed. The prospectus
bears out that authority, for no provisional
directors are named, the only persons mentioned
being Malcolm M‘Eachakn, of Melbourne, and
Archibald Forsyth, of Sydney, who are
“ treasurers ” pledged to hold any money sub-
scribed in trust and to return it if the co. is not
successfully floated; and excellent treasurers they
are.
* * * *
There is not much in the project to commend it
to the investing public, or to those who would be
willing to help with a few pounds towards the
establishment of a national morning newspaper.
It is proposed to raise £125,000 in 125,000 shares,
payable ss. on application, ss. on allotment, and
the balance in calls not exceeding Is. per share per
month. So soon as 40,000 shares are applied for
the company will be formed. It is indicated
that the policy of the paper will be “to conserve
Australian industries,” and a new cable service
is promised.
* * • *
Considered politically, the proposed new paper
promises but very little change from existing
dailies. The names of Mr. M’Eacharn and Mr.
Forsyth suggest a consistent devotion to Jingo-
Tory principles. “A new cable service”
sounds attractive, but of that more anon. So far,
the people who have been approached for assist-
ance have been all of the one class—the class of
S’Malcum M'Eaoharn —and their response has
not been enthusiastic. There was talk of one
manufacturer who was going to “put down”
£lO,OOO, and of a big tanner who was good for the
same amount, and of many others who were eager
with thousands. Mr. David Syme was also re-
ported to be violently anxious to subscribe at
least £20,000. But all that hasn’t materialised.
There is no mention in the prospectus of acquiring
the Star evening newspaper, and whether that
part of the project has been dropped or not is a
subject on which there are many conflicting
accounts.
• • * »
Considered financially, the prospectus is almost
farcical. The full capital provided for is £125,000,
and a start is to be made when 40,000 shares are
applied for, which shares would provide just
£20,000 cash and £2OOO a month for ten months.
Considering the fact that the Herald property is
worth at capitalised value about £1,000,000, and
the Daily Telegraph at least £300,000, what
chance has an enterprise with, at the utmost,
£125,000 available, of competing wi th these concerns
on equal terms and of establishing an indepen-
dent cable service ? And the Australian Times
(that is the proposed name) promises to start when
it has £20,000 in hand and another £20,000 call-
able within 10 months ! Sheer midsummer mad-
ness ! A modern plant (two printing-machines,
12 linotypes, steam plant, etching plant, office-fit-
tings, &c.) would easily run away with the whole
£20,000, and the £2OOO a month coming in from
calls wouldn’t go anywhere near to paying rent,
wages, paper, ink, telegrams, &c., especially as
there is talk of an editor at £3OOO a year at least,
twice the salary of any present daily paper
editor. The proposed capital is, in short, ridi-
culously inadequate, and to start on the lines
proposed would mean inevitable failure.

An independent cable service alone would
cost £BOOO a year at the least, and that sum
would have to be spent with discreet economy. Of
course this review of the chances of the proposed
new paper —a company-owned concern which
would have to win on its money if it won at all—
would not apply to the project if it were in the
hands of one or two knowledgeable newspaper
men with no political ties, with independent
minds, and with a resolution to give the public a
fair deal for its penny. They might start and
succeed >on £40,000. But the Australian Times,
if it comes to light, will have to fight with
its money-bags, and with them alone. It is
nonsense to suppose that its ideals will be any
loftier than those of the Herald or Telegraph,
or that it will be able to get better staff men,
except by paying better wages. And, in the con-
test of money, £20,000, or £125,000, has no chance
against £1,000,000.

The returned cohentingenter does not
promise to be an unmixed blessing to Maoriland
(writes a Bulletin correspondent). Some farmers
have been looking forward to the end of the war,
in the hope of getting cheaper labor when all the
patriots came home. But, unfortunately, the
man who comes back is altogether different from
the person who went away. The one was mostly a
farm hand, rather vain perhaps, and a trifle lazy,
but still useful, owing, in a measure, to his
ignorance of the outside world. The returned
hero is just as ignorant, a good deal lazier, and a
chronic wind-bag. His importance is immense,
and he nearly always expects a commission in the
next contingent. If the war is not over before
"next election, Seddon will require to despatch a
contingent consisting entirely of officers. From
their yarns (mostly gruesome), I learn that a
fatigue-party (Bushveldt Carbineers’), sent to
bury the dead, “chucks ’em all in, breathing or
not, damn them !” and that the greatest hardship
is the hunting for vermin on their clothing, which
is a daily duty, and begins soon after sailing.
What is Maoriland going to do with some thou-
sands of him later on ?
Sydney Morning Herald cordially assured
the public last week, in a leading article, that
there was no truth whatever in Professor Wood’s
statement that many volunteers went to South
Africa, not from love of the Empire, but to
escape the monotony of the bush. The wealthy
Herald, which dawdles all the year round com-
fortably adjacent to cool drinks and the pleasant
harbor and the opera and the refreshing Turkish
bath, can gather up the tail of its £6 10s. coat
under its arm, and take its half-crown
cigar out of its mouth, and say things
like that at its club quite easily. But Out-
back, where the grass and trees and saltbush
and sheep and cattle are dead, where the
crops are dead, where hope and credit are dead,
where the moving sand-drift blows where it lists
and banks up your house in a night, where whisky
is kerosene and old hatters are loony and squatters
are bankrupt, where almost the whole country
west of Dubbo is becoming depopulated, where
people wash about once a month because they
can’t get water to wash oftener, where 10s. a week
is wealth and 12s. 6d. is to be a Croesus, where
the selector cuts his own hair, where the perishing
framework which used to be a horse leans
up against the hut whose floor is dust
and its roof bark, where a half-naked race
of children is growing up in semi-savagery—well,
the well-fed Herald says that none of the volun-
teers who came from there were actuated by a
desire for change, and that they were all urged on
by the purest devotion to the Enipiah. And it
may be so. But this paper is willing to bet a
small sum that if the Herald proprietors changed
places with the people who struggle for a crust in
the back counties of Yanda and Yantara and
Yungnulgra they would, inside two years, be will-
ing to take a billet at shooting anybody for even
half-a-crown a week in order to get away.

“Snell”: The township consisted of 10
dwellings and business-places facing a sea_of
choppy mud called a road. The
centre of interest was Craiger’s
Hotel. On the afternoon of the
second day I was waited upon
by a committee of two, taking
up a collection in a hat.
“Willyer sling in a tanner,
boss ? ” said the man with
the hat. “What is the
collection for ? ” I asked.
“ Oh, we’re just tryin’ to
get a few bob to make
Dog-skin drunk.” “ A
worthy object, cer-
tainly,” I said ;
“but where do I
come in ?” “Well,”
. explained the man
I ‘with the hat, “we
make him drunk for
the binifit of the
community. When
things gits too ——
dull fer anythin’ we
make Dogskin Charley
tight, an’ he livens up
the town properly.
Why, mate (with enthu-
siasm) he’s the funniest
blanker when he’s drunk
what you ever saw. We made him blue-blind
Sunday afore larst, an’ I’m blowed if he didn’t
eat a kitten raw. Funny ! I thort I’d ’a’ died ! ”
Two hours later I saw Dogskin Charley riding
madly around in the mud on the back of a frantic
cow, to the large delight of a small audience.

“ Yeteran ” : Australia has made a mistake
in dressing its soldiers in kharki. The yellow-ochre
color was protective on the sandy plains of the
Punjab, where it was first adopted by the Sikhs
under old Ranjit Sing. So was the so-called
“rifle-green” in the pine forests of the Tyrol.
Kharki doesn’t seem to have been much of a suc-
cess as a protective color in S’Africa. Under
Australian conditions it is still less likely to
answer. Nature, which protectively adapts the
tints of beasts, birds, and insects to their back-
grounds, is remarkably sparing of yellows. Dark-
grey and various shades of brown are its favorites
for quadrupeds, and when you see a lot of kharki-
clad swaddies against a background of foliage you
know the reason. The kharki shows almost as
clearly as white from a distance, especially if the
foliage is distinctly Australian, whereas the dark-
green of the German jager or old-fashioned
British rifleman, though it shows up like black
against a background of bare sand-hill, is invisible
against a background of dark foliage. If an
approximately invisible dress is wanted for the
Commonwealth army it should be either dark-
grey or brown—say heather mixture. That would
match almost any background except the afore-
said sand-hill. Nothing would match that but
lemon-yellow.

A tip for the Sydney Health Court (5500
cases listed), now sitting. The drunks were so
numerous in Day Dawn (Murchison, W.A.) after
last big monthly pay, that the police had to go
out with a cart and gather them up, and “cord”
them alongside the chain-post. Then the local
“ foorce ” duly entered in the drunk-book : “ Two
and a-half cords of drunks.” Next morning the
local J.P. fined them 30s. a cord—a tarpaulin-
muster of a shilling apiece. It only wants to be
altered to £3OOO per cord, to fit the Sydney case.

He started, but about 500 brawny Welsh, Irish,
and Cornish ladies made it so hot for him that
there was a sudden resignation, and Nan and

“ H.V.H.” : At Cairns (N.Q.) local State
school I recently saw an “ infants’ ” class lining
up, bossed by girl pupil-teacher, aged apparently
14 or 15, and the class contained three big Chows
(height say sft. 7in.) and a dozen white nippers,
the tallest of whom was 4ft. Gin. All cheek-by-

“ Trotter ” : One Sunday, in North Rock-
hampton, recently, I saw from a point of vantage
the following issue from a certain quarter of that
desultory township: “A Kanaka and a white
woman on bicycles; a Kanaka and a white
woman with three children in a buggy ; a Hindu
and a white woman in a sulky ; two Syrians and
two white women with a load of children in a
spring cart; several Chows and Japs, with white
women, in different conveyances, all more or less
with children ; and a number of Kanakas, Chows
and Japs, on bikes, all making for Emu Park
and Yeppoon.” White Australia !
“ D.H.R.” : The “ native com-
panion ” has a peculiar method of feeding.
A flock of these birds will settle on a .'.well-'
grassed piece of land and diligently pick
it clean, leaving not a blade. Then they
shift, and repeat the process elsewhere.
“ Jaf ” protests :
Is there really a N.S.W. Forestry Department? If
so, what does it exist for ? Certainly, not to conserve
the valuable timbers of the State. I know of several
settlement-leases in Riverina where special conditions
were imposed on the lessees not to destroy useful box and
ironbark timber —of which there was none. But there
was much useful young stringy-bark which the lessees
are ruthlessly destroying, so that there may be a little
more grass for the rabbits and a few alleged sheep. No
action can be taken against these vandals, for the simple
reason that stringy-bark is not specified in the contract,
and anyway it’s too late now. What kind of a fool-dept.
is it that doesn’t take the trouble to find out anything,
but just trusts to luck and the grace of God in drawing
up its leases, in its eagerness to crowd land-hungry
settlers on to impossible areas? Will the Lands
Dept, paste in its hatPresident-of-the-Land-Appeal-Oourt
Oliver’s definition of a “home”: “The word home
denotes the maintenance, not of a bark-hut or shanty,
with sordid surroundings to match, but a reasonably com-
fortable place of residence, with the means and resources
derived from the holding on which it is situated, sufficient
to maintain a wife and bring up and educate the members
of an average family so as to take their places as respect-
able members of a community.” He might have added :
“ And not to create a race of farm-burners and looters ” !

Good timber is getting scarce in N.S. W.
Timber-merchants complain of the second and
third-rate stuff sent to them, and attribute this to
the unfair amount of exporting by certain firms.
English builders specify Australian woods in their
contracts, and the result is that the first-class
material goes ’Ome while we have to put up with
inferior qualities.

The accommodation of the Great Western State school
is greatly overtaxed. Into a room 35ft. by 20ft. are
crammed over 70 children and three teachers, in addition
to II desks, teachers’ desk, chairs, press, blackboard, and
a large gallery. In consequence of the vitiated atmo-
sphere, children every day become ill.
And yet the Black Hole of Calcutta is one of the
awful examples of the State school books.
“ Alpha” : In a Murray township, well
over the snow-line, about a dozen miners meet
every winter Sunday evening in the bar-parlor of
the only pub, and pass the evening singing
hymns, reciting “ Banjo ” Paterson’s poems,
and drinking whisky. Everything is con-
ducted in the most decorous manner. The
publican calls out the hymn, leads off in
the singing, collects the money for the
whiskies, and looks after the dice. Each
member shakes for himself, and the winner
of the pool contributes a shilling to the
local hospital-box. The congregation repre-
sents several nationalities, but no religious
belief worth mentioning—although one man is
suspected of having been at church 10 or 15 years
ago !

A Far-Western station-manager writes
The old shepherding-days have returned. I have
established a camp of six scrub-cutters where there is still
a good quantity of mulga, and here all the sheep I have
left alive are shepherded. Every two days they have to
be brought into my sole remaining tank for a drink.
This takes all day, a tedious job, and you can just imagine
what the cloud of dust is like, going constantly over the
same track. Total rainfall for the last five months, five
points. I always help to drive the sheep on m.v bike as
the.few horses (or rather horse frame-works) I have left
couldn’t carry a saddle. The scrub-cutting must cost
about £lO a week, but men don’t care about coming out
here now no matter what wage. The prospect of death
from thirst on the track isn’t alluring, and even when
they do reach a scrub-cutter’s camp, water is carted to
them in grudging quantities, out of a tank which has to
keep alive men, sheep, horses, bullocks, diseased rabbits,
emaciated kangaroos and emus (their bodies covered with
poverty-lice), some of which creatures get stuck in the
side-glue and die there, whilst in the water round them
float the drowned blow-flies which have been too eager to
get at them. Great stretches of timber have given up the
ghost—yarran, pine and belar. Carriers will hardly come
here even at the highest rates, and it always ends in your
having to send your own bullocks along to help, so you
have the satisfaction of paying and doing the work your-
self. The Bogan was dry long ago, Bourke and Wilcannia
are nearly deserted, and the Darling is a mere chain of
rapidly diminishing water-holes. Nothing but tales of
woe ail round.

“ Insignis ” : lie paying patients in coun-
try hospitals, “ Scotty W.” hits the nail on the
head, but doesn’t drive it home. It is common
for medicoes in a country town to treat a casual
patient until all his cash is expended, and then
send him to the hospital to be boarded, nursed
and doctored at public expense. The average
doctor is generally pretty keen on the bawbees,
and cares not who sinks so long as he comes on top.
I have been a hospital committee-man for years,
and am well up to the miserable tricks of the saw-
bones trade.

“ Walga ” : One aboriginal method of
duck-catching. They spread a net (made from
grass and bird-sinews) across a lagoon, and one
blackfellow remains on guard, provided with a
piece of bark, roughly shaped to resemble a flying
hawk. Others then go up creek and frighten the
ducks. As the birds pass the man on watch he
suddenly rises, and, throwing the piece of bark
into the air, utters a shrill, hawk-like scream.
The ducks imagine that their enemy is after them;
and, swooping down in affright, get their legs
entangled in the net.

SCENE FROM "THE RUNAWAY CTRL”
An ex-employee of a Victorian meat-
freezing factory tells this :
It was just on 12 o’clock one Saturday night, and all
but two or three of us had knocked off. The chief
engineer sent me to attend to some little matter in the
freezing-chamber. I went in and pulled the door behind
me. When I went back to the door to get out I found
somebody had screwed it up fast from the outside. I
called out, but was only answered by the echo of my own
voice. I got a hammer that had been left in the chamber
and banged at the door with it. Just then the electric
light was turned off, and I knew that everybody
but the boiler attendant had gone home—he was in
the engine-room, 150 ft. awav, and not at all likely to
visit the chamber. I could not get to him. I realised
that I was a prisoner for an indefinite period in a place
which would be kept at 15 degrees below zero. The
darkness was intense—l could feel it. I had but a few
feet square of clear space near my doorway in which
to move about. I dared not go among the hanging
sheep for fear of losing my way—and my door. I tried
hammering again. No answer. I slapped my arms
round mv shoulders to keep the blood in circulation. I
stamped mv feet; I shouted. I calculated the chances
of reaching a skylight in the roof. No, I couldn’t. Even
if I could, my frame might not go through the opening,
I felt that ‘ I was growing weaker' and knew that
my efforts to attract attention were growing more
hopeless everv moment. After about an hour in that
awful prison I began to calculate how long it would be
before I lost sensibility, and how long after that I should
live. Not more than an hour or two I guessed, and there
was no reasonable hope of any rescue within that time,
I picked up my hammer again and made a few feeble
strokes upon the door. Suddenly it opened. “ Good
God ! What the blazes are you doing here ? ” were the

first words—welcome, if rough—l heard from the boiler-
attendant. I found afterwards that the engineer, in his
haste to get off duty, had closed the door, forgetting all
about having sent me in. Yes, that’s how I came to
leave the job. I wasn’t having any more freezing-chamber,
so had to go. The risks of labor? Yes; but lam going
to take my risks in the open with an axe, or a pick and
shovel, in future.

“Piccola” on Australian encouragement
to Indian hawkers :
What’s the use of clamouring for a white Australia
while the piebald variety is encouraged by so many of our
farmers? I’ve stayed at scores of farmhouses in the
course of my wanderings, and have noted the different
treatment meted out to the white hawker and his Indian
rival. The former is invariably looked on as a “ take-
down,” and practically chased off the premises, whereas
the Indian is positively welcomed. He always shakes
hands “ Inglishee ” fashion with the missus, and, after
selling her some tinsel rubbish at fabulous prices, mono-
polises the kitchen-fire and cooking utensils till he has
cooked his meal. I have eaten at a table while a filthy,
foul-smelling Hindu, with a face of villainous cunning,
squatted on his haunches within a yard of me, cooking
his meat and potatoes ; said potatoes, by the way, together
with sugar, milk, and salt, being supplied gratis by the
farmer’s wife. I believe he’d have had a seat at the table
if he would have graciously consented to pollute himself
by eating with the degraded whites.
Another Australian certificate of good
character (given this time to the bushrangers
Kenniff) from a squatter:—
If they borrowed a £lO-note and agreed to pay it back
within a specified time, the pledge would be redeemed
even if they were obliged to go into their creditor’s pad-
dock and steal enough stock to raise the coin.

“A.C.” gives an interesting bit of vital
history:—
There is at present living on his farm at Oathcart (Vic.)
a patriarch who has four generations of descendants
living. His eldest daughter went to N. Queensland 27
years ago with a numerous half-grown family. Her
second child (a daughter also) married in Ravenswood
(Q.) and is now at Charters Towers with six sons and four
daughters. The eldest of these sons married last year in
Charters Towers, and has a son, the fifth in direct
descent, counting the old veteran in Victoria, who is still
on the farm which he took up 50 years ago. His children,
grand-children, great-grand-children and g. g. grand-
child run into three figures. This family provides strong
refutation of Dr. Ahearn’s sugar-planter theory that the
white race cannot live and thrive in the tropics, as here
are practically three generations ; and Mrs. Pollard, the
grand-daughter of the patriarch, a Victorian native, was
aged II or 12 years on her arrival in the tropics. Her
son, a tropical native, has married another tropical
native, and the families in this clan will bear comparison
in number with similar families in any temperate climate.
They will also hold their own, both physically and
mentally, despite all the sugar-dividend literature that
may be written with the blood and sweat of unfortunate
nigger slaves.
“BobR.”: Don’t quite
go with “Wallaroo’s”
sweeping condemnation of
the improvidence of the
farmer. Nearly every
N.S.W. farmer is the slave
of a bank or a storekeeper.
The latter mostly has the
crop, and takes good care
that every bag of wheat is
brought to him. Then,
when prices advance, he
can sell the farmer his own
wheat again at a profit—
which is all very well for
the storekeeper, but keeps
the slave’s nose close to the
grindstone. As for “keep-
ing a few sheep,” many
farmers make a bit by buy-
ing store stock off shears,
putting them on stubbles,
and selling them fat on the
approach of winter and
ploughing-time.

The proposal to intro-
duce the African eland to
N.S.W. backblocks does
not commend itself to the
sheep-man of the West.
This largest of the antelopes
is bigger than an average
bullock, and has a stomach-
capacity equal to a moder-
ate silo. Now, what would
be the use of such a beast in
the hard and dry West,
except for walking slap
through wire fences. A
15cwt. beast would snap No. 6 wire like cotton,
and his usefulness as a meat-producer would thus
be badly discounted.

off, and exclaimed, with a sigh of relief : “Ah,

is a naive little poem with its solemn explanation : “ I
have made ‘ years ’ and ‘ tears ’ two syllables although it
is sometimes made serve as one.” C.W.P.: No thrill
in your coal-mine yarn ; reads like a S.M. Herald account
of a fatal accident E.A. : Alas, the Freetrade dream
has ceased to be even a hope with the Vic. Freetrade
Association. It is now only a habit... .Miss S. : Don’t
see why, in the present lamentable state of the birth-rate,
Mollie would have been “better dead.” J.M. : Your
complaint is that men don’t think for themselves but
take ready-made opinions. But then they think they think,
and the fact that they don’t think is beyond them
Nymsie : One or two usable... .Lillie R. : You are too
enthusiastic Alfred E.L. : Bulletin loathes all paro-
dies which aren’t absolute works of genius H.V.H. :
Kanaka yarn bald, flat... S. : Seddon-jam verse derisively
rejected L.M. :No color in “Red Dahlia.” The
Hack : Too much color in your “ Red Dahlia.” (Curious
that two red dahlia stories should come in the same
hour, one with no blood in it, the other a slaughter-yard
of horror !) R.S. : Very long yarn : very long yawn...

like ’em plump and stately... .Wandering Native : Quite
useless... .Bluemetal : Mainly the sort of pap that funny
parsons work off when they lecture on “love, courtship
and marriage E. Vassal : Tale of the schoolmaster and
the three girls ambles prettily over some pages but gets
nowhere J.H. : “Crawl” would want too many
alterations Backstay: Material for a story, but you
tell it too harshly M.L. : Better use some pen-name
other than a single letter of the alphabet... .Mudyee :
You are right. Capt. Cox was never put upon trial in
connection with the death of the Kaffir. The man who
actually shot the Kaffir was tried, and he was acquitted
on the plea that he had only obeyed orders Naurik :
Yes, we Clink we have heard of him. A mining-
prospector, is he not? St.L. : “Episode ” colorless
Hippai: After taking a foolscap and a half you come to:
“ This is the story he told,” and then give a rather
improbable murder. Try to be brief... .R.K. : “Rose-
bud” Plot manifestly artificial. A deus ex machina
comes with creaking wheels and groaning pulleys to
arrange the elopement, and then it doesn’t come off
A Glenbarr (S.A.) : Inconclusive little bit of sentiment:
suitable for one of the heavier weeklies, any one of which
would probably take it.... Barry S. : “Coal-M.” hardly
strong enough. Ben Rio Not a very nice subject.
C.T. : “Lost” is lost L.S. (Eng.): Verse
not suitable to B Q.M. : Reason why there is
no “camp” for Q. mounted men this year has
probably something to do with the unspeakable
mismanagement of your State government; considering
the Federal administration is rather inclined to be over-
militaristic than otherwise... .Pros. G.: “ Light o’ Love ”
doesn’t scare... .Virie :We try not to illustrate British
music-hall humor C.P. : “Matilda” rather dull, and
liable to gross misinterpretation in spots.... Will S. : It
is not “ altogether devoid of merit,” but needs a better
passport than that to be printed here... .T.E.S. : “Not

Eva: Humor of the comic-valentine order doesn’t appeal
to 8.. . .E. : You say, “ Man is the only animal who re-

“Bob R.” to The Bulletin :
Tour criticisms of “ my opinion ” and Union matters
are hardly fair : I merely instanced two cases on which the
majority of the men are at variance with the A.W.U.',
and these two also constitute the divergent point between
the new and old unions—viz., raising the price
of shearing and shed work, and increasing amount of
membership fee. On neither of these questions have
the men had a chance of expressing an opinion, so that
the kicking-out of their officers goes for nought; more-
over, it being customary on the part of the A.W.U. to
take a vote amongst the men regarding any proposed
innovation in its rules and constitution, why was it
omitted in the two cases I instance ? Summed up, the
new rules simply represent the opinions of a few
delegates, not those of the men, and they will prove one of
the greatest blunders yet made by the A.W.U.
In South Melbourne court, the other day,
a miserable squabble took place between two
brothers over the coffin of a third. Francis Hall,
who described himself as “ a respectable citizen,”
sued his brother Joseph for £lO 135., the cost of
the third brother’s funeral. In cross-examination
plaintiff told defendant’s counsel that he was no
man to appear for him, and that if he did so in
some countries he would be dragged to pieces.
Then he lapsed into big tears. Later on plaintiff
said his idea was that as defendant gained under
their father’s will he ought to bury the brother.
“If I had had any money left to me,” he re-
marked savagely, “ I would have given my
brother an honorable funeral. Human nature,
sir! Common nature, sir ? ” Then he admitted
that his brother had left him some clothes, and
that he was going to keep them in a box, and let
them lie—“for 20,000 years, if you like,” he
cried. He added that defendant had got some of
the clothes, however, and that he had gone to
Geelong in them. Joseph Hall denied that he
was legally responsible for the debt, but said,
“From a moral point I am. If plaintiff will
handover deceased’s belongings,” he continued,
“ wearing apparel to the value of about £3 to a
poorer member of the family and pay the cost of
this action, I will pay the funeral expenses.”
Plaintiff promptly asked what the costs were, and
on learning that they amounted to £3 3s. he de-
clined his brother’s offer. The case was there-
upon dismissed, and plaintiff left the court in a
rage and saying bitter things about still another
brother.
Dear Bulletin. —ln reply to “Bob R.”
(5/4/’O2) and “Old Stoney” (12/4/’O2), let me say
that their ignorance of everything connected with
the A.W.U.’s policy and internal management is,
to me, sufficient proof that they are not, and pro-
bably never were, of its membership. For
instance, the memtership-fee has not been raised
to £1 per year, but from 12s. Gd. for shearers to
155., and from 7s. 6d. for shed-hands to 10s. The
salaries of branch secretaries have not been raised
by £25 per ahnum. Each branch votes its own
salaries. What the recent conference did was to
fix a maximum. lam certain that neither of
these gentlemen, who so enthusiastically hail the
bogus union, and so gushingly laud the lordly
squatter, ever read the Worker, or ever were in
sympathy with unionism. Their ignorance is too
dense for the one ; their spleen too evident for the
other. Let me say, also, that this alleged new
Shearers’ Union could not have been formed as a
protest against what was done by the late A.W.U.
conference, for the very good reason that its rules
were in type while that body was discussing the
policy for the coming season, —G.B.
Terrified by Apparitions.
A peculiar story concerning fancied apparitions
has been told to the local press by a Miss Viola
Dawson, residing at 156 Alfred-street, North
Sydney. “Four years ago (she relates) I had to
leave school because I imagined that I could see
black faces looking at me wherever I went. My
nerves were so unstrung that St. Vitus’ dance was
induced, and until recently, when Dr. Williams’
pink pills for pale people cured me, I suffered
severely. I was so nervous that I would start at
the slightest sound, my hands and face twitched
involuntarily, I lost my appetite and fell away so
much that I was almost too weak to walk. The
tonics I first tried did not relieve me, but after
taking one boxful of Dr. Williams’ pink pills I
felt greatly improved, and by continuing to take
them I progressed nicely. Three boxfuls made
me a strong, healthy girl, free from all weakness
and nervousness, and I now enjoy the very best
of health.” Indeed, Miss Dawson’s attractive
appearance and fine complexion are worthy
of remark as showing the great value of Dr.
Williams’ pink pills in inducing perfect health.
Being a nerve tonic and a blood builder they act
directly on the blood and nerves—enriching the
blood and freeing it from all impurities, and
making the nerves taut. They cure hysteria,
heart palpitation, dyspepsia, biliousness, anaemia
and debility, rheumatism, neuralgia, skin diseases,
ailments of children, etc. From chemists and
storekeepers and the Dr. Williams’ Medicine Co.,
Queen’s Place, Sydney, two and nine per box,
six boxes fifteen and threepence, post free. A
boxful or two of Dr. Williams’ pink pills will, by
strengthening the constitution, free one from all
ordinary risks of plague.

DISEASE CONQUERED BY THE
Freeman & Wallace Electro-Medical System.
NERVOUS DERANGEMENTS: Treatment, Causes, Cure.
A SCIENTIFIC DISCOVERY.
•PHE Australasian Climate is in many instances a debilitating: one to many classes of men and
. women. In young people, however, it tends to those abnormal physiological conditions
productive of so many nervous troubles in later life, and which lead to hyper-sensitive conditions of
the nervous system. The Specialists of the Electro-Medical and Surgical Institute have
proved in thousands of instances that the scope for the intervention and application of Electro-Thera-
puetics in functional and organic diseases of the central nervous system is very large. A new field
of physical medication is being exploited, by which long-standing diseases are being checked and con-
quered, and valuable lives are daily saved from premature decay and Death.
S¥l
A NEW TREATMENT.
EDIOAL SCIENCE, like all developments of progressive thought, is liable to change, and although
thousands of persons have died under their proving^ Science
inexact one,
by following
chief symptoms may be followed by complete radical changes m the system of a man or woman,
arresting completely the process of disease. Symptoms of disease m the nervous system often arise from
structural Ganges in the nervous tissues themselves, and these changes, unless treated effectively, are destructive.
To subdue these symptoms, arrest the course of the disease, and save the sufferer's life, ts
the aim and the end of the Specialist’s study. ______
“Electric Invigorator” as Worn by Men or Women
dj
THE treatment for the Renovation of
Debilitated or Enfeebled
Constitutions, arising from physio-
logical or climatic causes, must possess a
well-defined restorative influ-
ence, acting at once on all the functions
of the body, increasing: digestion,
blood-formation, assimilation,
innervation, invigoration, as well
as healthy nutritive processes. If these
can be assured, a new being is cre-
ated. The treatment which lends itself
with peculiar adaptability to all impaired
nervous systems is that of Electric-
Medication, or the combined sys-
tem of Medicine and Electricity.
In these two great remedial factors lies
strength for the strengthless;
pc.ver for the palsied; health
for the unhappy. Electricity is Life ;
Disease is Death. If you wish to be a
strong man or woman, with the
power to walk long upon the paths of human pleasure ; to lay aside the
crutches of your physical impairment and enjoy Life as it is
driven in health to mankind; you should adopt this new treatment.
Your adoption means endorsement. YOu will be cured in a few weeks or
months of the most persistent complaint. You will send us your
grateful thanks.
TREATMENT UPON LONG
STANDING DISEASES.
AAi E have lately received testimonies from persons who had
suffered from Bad Stomachs, Indigestion, Dys-
pepsia, Epileptic Fits, Convulsions, Palpitation,
Insomnia, Sick Headaches, Bad, Painful Backs,
Kidney and Bladder Troubles, Sciatica, Ner-
vousness, Rheumatism and Functional Disor-
ders, for many years, expressing their delight at their
steady recovery from their troubles after so much hopeless
suffering. Physicians of the widest experience endorse this
treatment as one that will effect radical changes in the
curing of diseases that have hitherto baffled the professional
mind. Already the “ Rontgen Rays ” have been successfully
used in the London hospitals in checking the ravages of
Cancer. What secrets are not hidden in the application of
this current which animates all living things from
Pole to Pole? No man or woman need give up hope,
thinking themselves doomed, when relief is at hand. The
new treatment of the Institute is invaluable ; it supplies the
nerve-force—Animal Magnetism— which is lacking,
to the enfeebled frame. The best nerve-and-muscle invigorator
at present within the grasp of the public is the
“Electric Invigorator ” of the Institute.
POWERS OP RESTORATION AND SENSATION.
THE action of this
marvellous recuper-
ative agent upon the
nervous system is direct
and practical. Worn
around the loins in close
proximity to the nerves
traversing the lumbar
parts of the body, its ef-
fect upon the digestive
organs is at once mani-
fest. It imparts a healthy
activit3 T to the nervous
system, a gentle, con-
stant electrifying current
dominates the nutritive
functions and stimulates
them. It builds anew
the elements Of the ner-
vous system, causing
normal functional ac-
fee

sensation. Its effect upon all nervous systems is equal, it gives energy to the brain,
courage to the heart, strength to the sinews, “ grit" to the muscles ; it transform*
the weak into physical and mental giants. The cost of this wonderful electrical
agent is but the sum of £l. It is guaranteed by two of Sydney’s leading Elec-
tricians as the completest, most efficacious, least expensive, and most delicately,
constructed scientific instrument of its kind used in medical science.

SOME
STRONG
SOUND
REASONS.
There are several
REASONS why our
Belt is superior to all
others. It is necessary to
explain what those reasons
ate. The first Is, that it
is recommended by the
Medical Faculty. The
second is it has been ex-
haustively tested and pro-
nounced as “ electrically
perfect ” by a Leading
Sydney Electrician.
Thirdly, it is manufactured
ti the colonies, and is
therefore transmitted duty
ree into the Oommon-
irealth States which makes
its purchasing prioe to
Inter-State patients 20 per
font, less than the im-
ported article. Fourthly,
It is guaranteed as genuine
and medically perfect by a
firm of undoubted repu-
tation and commercial
worth. These are all good
reasons why you should
purcase from us and no-
where else.

TO
PATIENTS
AND
PURCHASERS.
TO those who have pur-
chased Belts else-
where, the Specialists
would like to say a few
words. If any instrument
has been used and found
lacking: in curative pro-
perties and has failed to
redeem the sufferer from
pain and physical misery,
that sufferer should con-
sult the Specialist of the
Institute. The reason why
this should be done is be-
cause electric applications
alone fail to act bene-
ficially upon the system,
whereas a judicious use of
Medicine and Electricity
will banish the most per-
sistent and obstinate cases
of disease. The special
treatment of the Institute
will be found curative,
therefore anyone lacking'
relief from Belts pur-
chased elsewhere should
embrace this opportunity
offered. The Specialists can
completely cure them.
What Mr. E. AMES, exponent in Australia of the new Tod Sloan style of riding, says :
THE SPECIALISTS. . . . „ , • , -
“ I endorse the new methods of muscular and nervous restoration practised by you in your system of Electro-Medical treatment,
power by which I was successful in winning TWO GREAT RACING EVENTS in one day.”
Australian Jockey Club Hotel, Randwick, March 12th, 1902.
I attribute to it much of the strength of nerve and mental
(Signed) EDWARD H. AMES.
RUPTURE.
mHE toughest and best-tempered steel becomes dulled in time and so does
the most energetic mind and strongest body at times become strained.
WE CUBE RUPTURE and we cure it so that it will remain cured.
Our methods are modern, reliable, permanent. We have cured more
ases of Rupture than any other association of medical men in Australasia,
lur “Electric Truss ” is an unsurpassed agent for strengthening' the
weakened abdominal walls. Nine out of every ten can be cured in
three months by our system of painless treatment without loss of
time or interruption of business. We have numberless testimonials to
this effect.
DOUBLE ELECTRIC TRUSS.
Used in cases of Inguinal Hernia. It causes no
irritation or sense of discomfort ; it is built on the
Moc-Main Lever principle, and its parts are covered
with soft Chamois Leather Pads which rest softly
on the skin, ensuring comfort, ease, and certainty
of action. Guaranteed not to BURN, BLISTER,
or IRRITATE.
SPECIALITIES.
rfIHE following are Specialities of the Institute. Anyone suffering
from long-standing cases should apply to the Specialists:
Anaemia, Functional Heart Trouble, Impaired Digestion, Dys-
pepsia, Sick or Nervous Headache, Sciatica, Kidney Inflamma-
tion, Congestion, Diabetes, Dropsy, Dumbago, Rheumatism,
Liver Affections, Varicose Veins, Neurasthenia or Vital Weak-
ness, Varicocele, Abscess, Nervousness, Catarrh, Chest and
Lung Affections, Asthma. Ninety per cent, of long-standing cases of
the above diseases have been successfully cured. If a man or woman is
incurable, the Specialists frankly say so.
LETTERS.
PRIVACY
THE correspondence
system of the In-
stitute is reliable for
privacy, punctuality,
precision. A letter, as
soon as received, is re-
plied to. It is treated
with professional se-
crecy, and no one sees
its contents but the
Specialists themselves.
Some persons are sensi-
tive in medical matters,
and do not desire publicity. The Institute’s
system is secrecy itself. If medicines are sent to
a patient, they are packed free from observation
and sent to any address the patient desires. It
will be the patient’s fault if the secrecy is violated.
Some Reliable Voluntary Testimonials.
Mr. W. GAHAGAN, Ex-Champion N.S. Wales League Wheelmen, says : “ I have worn your Electric
‘ INVIGORATOR ’ during training- for some of my principal bicycle matches. It always gave me relief. It has
a most strengthening effect upon the system.”
March 12th, 1902. (Signed) W. GAHAGAN.
Mr. J. H. BROWN, Professional Student of Art and Music, asserts: “I testify to the marvellous benefits
derived from your Electro-Medical treatment. Anyone suffering from Brain-Fag or general decline of the nervous
system should consult the Specialists of vour Institute.”
August 12th, 1901. ' (Signed) J, H. BROWN.
Mr. JACK WILLIS, Professional Pugilist of Intercolonial Celebrity, attests: “ I derived much benefit
from your Electro-Medical treatment. In one of my recent fights, the press said I had never before appeared in
such perfect physical condition. This result was due to the wearing of one of your ‘IN VIGOR ATORS.’”
March 22ndj 1902. (Signed) JACK WILLIS.
Mr, G. JOHNS, Champion Light-weight Pugilist of Australia, affirms : “ I have found most beneficial
results through wearing one of your ‘ INVIGORATORS.’ In training and in actual contests your Electropathic
treatment has done great good both to my nervous and physical systems.”
March 24th, 1902. (Signed) G. JOHNS.

POLITICAL
POINTS
The colossus of Rhodes (and Bridges)—-
O’Sullivan “Facing the Dawn.”
Mr. W. Martin, president of the Austra-
lian Natives’ Imperial Association, “is understood
to be a dead-bird for a seat in N.S.W. Leg.
Council.” Humph !
Mr. Barton at the Seddon banquet (where
every thought was turned to gore and one could
almost see the joints Weeding afresh):
We mean to stick to the Empire, and the blood that
made it is the blood that will preserve it.
One member of the Reps., during the
tariff discussion, worked very hard for a duty on
Oregon and M.L. pine, with the object of pro-
tecting the Q. timber industry. Then he turned
round and wanted axe-handles on the free list!
The Bowen railway (just about to be
closed down) lost £2577 last year. Cooktown line
(just reprieved) lost £8621 for the same period.
The Mackay line was £3963 short for the same
time, but Mackay sends in two faithful Govern-
ment pillars, and is, consequently, quite safe from
injury.
It seems to be accepted in the press
gallery that the Govt, will have a majority of
two in any crucial division on the tariff in the
Senate. The Labor party bosses the situation,
and, in return for the legislation on black labor, is
pledged to give the Govt, support on the tariff
question.
The Kyabram (Vic.) reformers are eager
for the abolition of the Speakership, Speaker’s
duties to be carried out by the Chairman of Com-
mittees. There is sense in this. The chair is,
after all, only a support for an aspirant to reach
for a K.C.M.G., and Victoria can’t afford £lOOO a
year for that.
South Australia, in 1901, had 5204 less
children under five years than in 1891, and 5548
more ancients over 60 years. N.S.W. is in the
same situation, and so, probably, are some of the
other States whose figures are not available yet.
This swapping of babies for patriarchs is a bad
sign—also a bad bargain.
DE LA RETS REWARD.
(As the Chamberlain Government seems unable to
make a choice of a reward for De la Rey for his
generous treatment of the captured General Metheun,
THE BULLETIN offers a hint.)
KETOHENER : “De la Rey, ice are deeply touched
by your noble humanity, and I am requested
to offer you this small token of Imperial
appreciation—it is the rope with which we
hanged several of your countrymen .”
It is a sinister fact that whenever retrench-
ment is tried in Q. the Education Dept, gets the
first blow —and the last. In ’93 the unfortunate
teachers, north, west, and Central, had lumps
deducted from their miserable pittances, and only
last year got back to normal. Now the Depart-
ment is again being assailed.
Groom, of Queensland, and Hartnoll, of
Tasmania, cost the Commonwealth £1650 for their
election to the House of Reps. ; and Hartnoll,
“the candidate for Adams,” stood the country
£llOO of the sum. That was a lot to pay for
Hartnoll, and should his election be upset, as
threatens, it will be lost after all.
The way of the “ temporary ” civil servant
is going to be hard up North. There is a Publio
Service Act, but members with a “pull” could
always find impecunious friends a job by getting
them “ temporarily” into the various easy-working
departments at 10s. a day. The Black Wednesday
of the “ temporaries” is coming at last.
Premier Seddon claims to be the author
of the Imperial trade-preference scheme which he
trumpets so blatantly. As a matter of fact, he
prigged it from B. R. Wise. It is a characteristi-
cally Wise kind of measure, subtly designed to
evade the spirit, while keeping strictly to the
letter, of England’s commercial treaties with
foreign rivals.
Henry Copeland gets an assistant named
White at £5OO a year to take secretary Yardley’s
place in N.S.W. Agency-General. On Mr.
Yardley’s death, Premier See stated distinctly
that the appointment of a substitute was not
contemplated, and it was said also that the office
would be reorganised, and Australians appointed
to future posts.
As to the chances of peace in S’Africa, it
is an unhappy omen that the proposals should be
made in March. It was in March, 1900, after the
battle of Paardeberg, that the first peace negotia-
tions were started. In March, 1901, Ketchener
met Botha in fruitless conference. In March,
1902, the third negotiations opened. Is there
any special reason for discussing peace in March ?
The High Commissionership is not to be
filled until Mr. Barton returns from London.
Bigjohn Forrest is clamorously eager for the
billet (and if refused he might try and be nasty
when another member of the Cabinet wants to be
“ translated ”), but Mr. Barton thinks that, if he
takes Mr. Forrest to London, he’ll be able to
frighten him off asking for position by pointing
out its difficulties. Vain hope. Bigjohn is not a
modest man.
Some members of Vic. legislature seriously
contemplate the introduction of a Bill as the
corollary of the reduction-of-screws movement,
to reduce the expense of being M.P. This
measure would make it bribery and corruption
for any member to donate money to a sports club,
or any other institution except the local hospitals
or benevolent asylums during his official term.
It would also strictly limit election expenditure.
If these two reforms are effected, most members
will be quite willing to have their Parliamentary
dole cut down.
The N.S.W. Government programme for
the new session is officially announced as consist-
ing of an Audit Bill and “amend-
ments” of the liquor law, old-age-
pension law, and land and income
tax. This is so vague that it pro-
bably means nothing more than a
colorless and hazy tinkering with
small details. If amending the liquor
law means abolishing tied houses or
establishing a State Drink monopoly,
or if the patching of the land-tax law
means so graduating it that it will
fall with special weight on owners
of large estates, absentees, and
especially on the growing squire
class which doesn’t cultivate its own
land, but lets it out to rack-rented
tenants, it will be real progress. If
it means an extra-careful dotting of
the “i” that was overlooked in the
original Act it means nothing in par-
ticular. There is not a word about
reforming or abolishing the Upper
House or reducing the Assembly.
As regards the annexation of the
rents of the Sydney resumed area as
revenue, and paying the correspond-
ing interest out of loans, there is the
deadest of dead silences. But it is
vaguely explained that the amend-
ment of the Old Age Pension system
is in the direction of rigid cutting-
down of expense—while there are old
Boers to be killed the keeping of old
Australians alive has to be done as
cheaply as possible.
English Roman Catholics, it is
cabled, are petitioning the English
Government to take the control of
church property in England out of
the hands of the Papacy, and to
claim a veto on the appointment of
Irish R.C. bishops (presumably
with a view to discouraging any
tendencies to Fenianism in the
episcopacy). But these petitioners are regarded
by the Irish R.C.’s not as Catholics but as Car-
tholics—English Chrtholics; and the withering
contempt of that Car is something that cold
print can’t express.
Sydney D.T. growls viciouslv at any pro-
posal to increase the allowances of Federal Parlia-
mentarians. That syndicate organ would like to
see payment of members abolished together.
Premier Peacock answers the reform agi-
tation in Victoria with a sullen declaration that
it would be money in his pocket if he were out of
politics. Possibly, but does the vain bird mean to
say that he does not owe much of his success in busi-
ness to his luck in politics ? Peacock the Minister
and Premier has been a big advt. for Peacock the
legal manager.
“AND SO SAT ALL OF US”
JOHNNY: “ What's a capital offence, gran.?”
GRAN. (Mayor of Croabungalong): “ Why, if
they don’t fix the site of the Federal City at
Croabungalong that’ll be a capital offence, and
don’t you forget it, my boy.”
Works-Minister O’Sullivan has decided
that in N.S.W.
All communications addressed to the Department of
Works are to be replied to through the members con-
cerned, whether presented by them or not.
What hope is there of Local Government when
the roads-and-bridges influence is thus deliberately
fostered ?
In his alleged history of the Boer war,
Conan Doyle says:
A brave race can forget the victims of the field of battle,
but never those of the scaffold. The making of political
martyrs is the last insanity of statesmanship.
True, and it applies with as much force to
Scheepers, Lotter, and other victims of military
courts as to the victims of Slachter’s Nek. But it
is a lot easier to acknowledge our grandfathers’
wrong-doings than our own.
It is wonderful how little makes an
“outrage” in Ireland as compared with other
countries. Last Monday it was cabled all the
way out here that the tails of ten cattle had been
cutoff in Galway. That was called “agrarian
outrage ! ” Think of sending such poor trash to a
country where certain cattle-stealers have just
burned a squatter and a policeman and hung the
bags containing their bones on a horse, and turned
the walking sepulchre loose !
“ Aurora ” to The Bulletin :
What is Lyne’s game ? Speaking on the Supply Bill, in
the Heps., he said he refused to be bound to take junior
officers from State departments exclusively, and justified
his appointment of a junior clerk by saying that the clerk
had been temporarily employed for some months in the
Dept, of Home Affairs. S’William forgot to mention
another junior he has appointed, and who has not been
temporarily employed in the Dept. Perhaps he thought
latter not worth mentioning. Said junior has only left
school a few months, and had been running messages for
a local bank in S’William’s electorate. Now he is a junior
at £lOO to start! Father is a “ big ” man and supports
S’William. How many has he really appointed ?
S.A. Opposition-leader John Darling con-
demns the Govt, for offering the Northern Terri-
tory to the Federation for the amount of its public
debt (£2,500,000). “Why,” he declares, “even
with the handicap of the Alien Immigration Act”
(that’s the sort of man he is), “ I would be willing
to form one of a syndicate to offer £3,500,000 for
the Territory.” Also, he would do all in his power
to engineer a land-grant railway across the con-
tinent. He considers that at least 10 millions
should have been asked from the Federation, as
that would have left a margin for beating down.
When the deputationists of the “ Reform ”
Conference waited on Premier Peacock with their
resolutions about reducing the cost of governing
Victoria, that thin and futile man, instead of
telling them certain healthy and essential truths
about themselves, begged them not to cast
aspersions on the management of the country lest
it should have a bad effect on future loans.
Australia is so pathetic a slave to the foreign
Cohen nowadays that it can’t even talk of its own
affairs above a whisper less Moses or Levi should
have his ear at the keyhole.
N.S.W. Premier See garrulously reveals
that he always consults the members of his
Cabinet and does not believe in despotically con-
trolling affairs. Probably a very prudent, business-
like habit in Mr. See’s circumstances. When
S. H. Parker was Minister in the Forrest (W.A.)
Government he thus, in a bold, free hand, con-
veyed his sentiments to his chief :
You appear determined to treat your fellow-ministers,
not as colleagues but as subordinates, a position which I
certainly refuse to occupy.
How a Premier and a Cabinet may work together
depends wholly on the kind of man the Premier
is—and the kind of men his Ministers are.
“The Country Party,” or Cocky Party,
which has been formed in N.S.W. to counteract
the influence of the Labor Party, hasn’t got the
courage of its Toryism. It represents itself as
being mildly in favor of everything the L.P.
Strongly favors : for instance, it believes in day-
labor—a cocky day, presumably, beginning at 3
a.m. and ending at 11.45 p.m. The Country
Party doesn’t declare against a mad borrowing
policy, only suggests that the madness shouldn’t
rage beyond £2,000,000 a year. It is altogether a
weak and spineless affair and fitted only to be a
municipal council somewhere.
A series of indignation meetings is being
held in Victoria to demand reform of the
fcitate Parliament—that reform on which
Peacock and Co. backed down a year or
so ago. When the present Vic. Assembly
was elected it was divided into two parties.
Both agreed that the legislative machine
was now absurdly cumbrous, but one section
advocated a popularly-elected convention
to draft a new State constitution—the only
idea likely to meet the case—while the
other wanted Parliament to reform itself.
When Parliament met, the Convention
party, which included the Peacock Minis-
try, dropped its scheme; and the party
that wanted Parliament to reform itself,
which included the whole Upper House,
was never heard of. In view of next year’s
election the country begins to inquire after
these lost parties. When both parties in &
Legislature get lost it is time to inquire.
The Philp (Q.) Ministry is really pitiful
in its paltriness. Labor-member Bowman was
ousted by Leahy, brother of the Minister for
Railways, from the Warrego seat. Acting under
a misapprehension as to the currency of his
Parliamentary pass, Bowman scrupulously and
honestly paid his fare back to Brisbane, and then
learnt that he was entitled to use the free pass
back to the capital. So he applied for a refund,
and this was refused by the Minuter on the
ground that—
He would be extremely sorry to take *way from the
ex-Labor member the privilege to pose as a hero who had
gained so much kudos and applause for his self-sacrifice
on the altar of principle.
The lone remnant of*"' the Victorian
Freetraders got together in Melbourne the other
day, and not being able to find a local shoddyist
of any standing to talk to them they were
harangued by Symon, the S.A. lawyer, and
M'Millan, the Sydney agent for an English
exporting firm. The latter told them that
“ Freetraders had only to organise themselves to
win all over Victoria,” and the audience tried to
look as if it believed this. But the Freetraders
have been for years about the best organised party
in Victoria, and have never won anything. Even
the most careful organising of two foreign im-
porters and a dog won’t make them count for
more at the polls than 50,000 disorganised
Protectionists.
Wellington Post, under the heading of
“ An Amazing Falsehood,” deals with Seddon’a
denial of his “ Dahomey ” speech :
If this bloodthirsty speech was never uttered, how
came it that it was published in the colony without a
word of question or contradiction ? For the simple
reason that it was true. Its author dared not resort to a
denial. He knew that it would only cover him with
shame and confusion. When he arrived in Sydney, how-
ever, he doubtless became unpleasantly aware that his
appeal to the savage instincts of the native race had been
there made the subject of strong and adverse comment.
He had captured the Maori vote for next general election,
but he had forgotten that the shameful means employed
might become known to the outside world. The dis-
credit of it must be removed. What more certain and
easy than an absolute denial ? But the denial was as
base as it was mendacious.
The true “strength” of what is locally
known as the ‘ ‘ Kyabram ” movement for Vic.
Parliamentary “reform” may be gauged by the
force behind it. Both Argus and Age barrack
for all they are worth ; neither will insert any
letters adversely critical; in fact, all opposition is
stifled. Reduction is wanted, but to reduce the
Assembly from 95 to 46 and the Council in pro-
portion means more than doubling the present
electorates. This would give Fatman an even
bigger advantage than at present—especially if
salaries be reduced to £2OO a-year—and destroy
almost all hope of ever reforming that costly
obstruction, the House of Landlords. A single-
House of 60 members would cost less, do more-
work, and would be nearer to government by the
people, not by David Syme.
The general elections throughout S.A., for
both Council and Assembly, take place this Satur-
day, when all 18 of the members of the Upper
House will be returned by four districts, and 42
representatives will be chosen for the other
Chamber by 13 constituencies. Unfortunately no
pretence is being made by the- Government
towards any scheme of reform, either consti-
tutional, social, industrial or financial, and so the
splendid opportunity of the double dissolution
(which has coma merely as an incident of the
reduction in the strength of the Legislature) will
be lost. Kingston wrecked his long-lived Minis-
try in an attempt to force the Council to the
people, and, now the event for which he strove so
hard has happened, there is absolutely no leader
of Liberal thought in the State far-sighted enough
or sufficiently bold to take advantage of it. And
the press is as flaccid as the politicians. Where-
fore a Conservative reaction is threatening.
From Adelaide :
Perhaps never before in Australian political history
was there quite such a subordination of principles to-
expediency as is now apparent in the contest for Torrens
(Adelaide suburban) in S.A. Assembly. Premier Jenkins
was once a colleague of Kingston and professes to be a
Liberal. Opposition leader Darling is a hard-crusted Tory
of the most rigid commercial type and glories in his
antagonism to everything that savors of healthy socialism.
He is endeavoring to carry in with him a weak reflection
of his views in architect Soward. Jenkins, however, is so
anxious to secure place and pay again that he has con-
cluded an alliance with Darling’s committee by which he
promises them the votes of his supporters in return
for their help. There are five seats for Torrens, and
the other candidates include Tom Price, leader of Labor
party, Coneybeer and Dankel, the Labor nominees,
Maekie (Mayor of Unley and sec. of the Commercial
Travellers’ Association) who is a good Liberal, and Craw-
ford Vaughan, a Single-Taxer. None of these, however, is-
receiving the slightest help from Jenkins, who has thrown
himself wholly into the arms of the enemy, and who yet
wonders why the Labor party is so bitter against him,
while the Liberals gaze mournfully at his desertion of
their ranks. Some vigorous personality like that of
Kingston is urgently needed in S.A. just now to
strengthen the weak hands and confirm the feeble knees
of his olden party, which now wanders as a flock without
a shepherd, a prey to ravening wolves in sheep’s clothing
of the Jenkins type, who care nothing for conscience or
consistency as compared with the fleshpots on the
Treasury benches. Unfortunately the Labor party is in
very incompetent hands.

The PIANOLA

The Pianola in use with Upright Piano.
When you desire
to play a selec-
tion outside of
your repertory,
you roll it into
position again, so
that its felt-cov-
ered fingers rest
notes, while the musical taste of
the player (in either case) is re-
sponsible for the expression. Both
“touch” and “tempo” are regu-
lated by him, thereby portraying
his musical personality in the
result.
It is this human effect which
has astounded the musical world,
and which is not fully understood,
except by those that have heard it.
As shown in the block, the
Pianola looks like a small cabinet.
When you wish to play the piano
by hand, the Pianola may be
rolled to another part of the room.
upon the keys of the piano and
insert the roll of music to be
played. By the use of the ex-
pression-levers you render the
selection according to your own
interpretation of the composer’s
meaning, or to suit your particular
mood.
The operation of the Pianola is
simple, requires no musical know-
ledge on the part of the player,
and yet there are no limitations to
the artistic effects obtainable.
Can be purchased on the hire
system if desired.

A BAD CASE OF TUMOUR REMOVED,
and the System Cleared
BY ....
VITADATIO
ii— b
Nicholson-road, Subiaco,
West. Australia.
25/4/01.
Mr. S. A PALMER,
Sir, —I wish to bear testimony to the efficacy of
VITADATIO in clearing from my breast a Tumour that
had formed in it and which had caused me much pain
and trouble, and in the opinion of the doctor was of a
severe order.
I am now free from all pain, and the doctor whom I
saw since is astonished at such a simple remedy as
VITADATIO having taken it away, and advises its
continuance.
I may say that the lump had roots running under the
arm and round the breast, and I may add that another
growth I had inwardly has under the influence of
VITADATIO completely gone. I have since passed for
life insurance, thus proving the completeness of my
cure.
Make what use you please of this letter, as I am
willing to answer any questions, in order to help others
who suffer.—Yours respectfully,
ANNIE WHITE.
Witness—W. J. Fist.

“Jimmy” Thomson, erstwhile of Melb.
Evening Standard, announces the issue of a new
daily evening paper—the Fremantle (W.A.)
Courier—for Ist May. He does not intend to
launch out on such a scale as when he promoted
the Standard, but he reckons on building up a
good property, as there is no other paper in
Fremantle—now credited with a population of
nearly 30,000. The new concern is a limited co.,
and has capital behind it. Jimmy had a lot of
bad luck on the Murchison goldfields, which were
oo poor to keep a goat alive, and is now due for a
hange of fortune.
, r . . , , „ n •
feature of last Eight Hours Day m
Melbourne was the number of lost infants lodged
at the watch-house. One burly Bourke-st. police-
man came to the place wrestling desperately with
a three-year-old kiddy. The Lavv had the waif in
its arms, and the waif was howling like a small
fiend. One fist was full of the whiskers of the
Law, and a soddened ginger-bread horse in the
other furiously battered the face of the Force. A
watching crowd was convulsed with rapture, and
sent up a yell: “ Assault an’ battery, an’ obsthruct-
in’ the police in the ixicution av their juty ! ” and
it was a most distracted officer who finally reached
shelter.
Clerical clown Geil (appropriately pro-
nounced Guile) grand boss of the Melbourne
Simultaneous Mission, told a Town Hall audience,
t’other day, that a leading American infidel, also
a military man, had disgraced himself during the
Civil war by bolting the first time he was under
fire. Geil ingeniously added that he would not
defile his mouth by mentioning the man’s name—
but left the impression in everybody’s mouth that
the poltroon was Ingersoll. Now, no such inci-
dent was ever related about Ingersoll before,
though the orthodox platform arid press all over
the world strove hard during his whole life to dis-
credit him. Moreover, such an action is wholly at
variance with every other detail of Ingersoll’s
fearless and self-sacrificing career; while, finally,
it is extremely unlikely that a lieutenant who had
exhibited gross cowardice on the battle-field would
ever have attained the rank of colonel. Of course,
had anybody arisen and contradicted Mr. Geil, it
would have been easy to say that the reference
was not intended for Ingersoll but for another
man whose name could not possibly be revealed.
Anyhow, the incident shows the tactics that the
legions of piety are forced to adopt. And after all,
what does it show if an infidel did run away?
Frederick the Great did the same thing in his
first engagement.
How to File up the Centuries.
This is a feat best known to cricketers, and of
all cricketers probably those of Australia most
frequently perform the trick. But the best cen-
turies are those which represent years of life. For
a man or woman to become a centenarian is in
itself Nature’s own certificate of a well-spent life
no less than of a sound constitution. Of this, the
better kind of century, Australia has also had a
few notable examples, and we will hazard the
prophecy that she will have yet others. Mrs.
Elizabeth Fuller, of No. 44, Ryder-street, Surry
Hills, Sydney, N.S.W., now 83 years of age, is
still hale and hearty, and, we believe, good for a
further indefinite term of life.
Anybody who lives to the age of 71, as Mrs.
Fuller did, without knowing what it was to be
seriously ill, and then to beoome ill only as the
result of accident, has something substantial to
boast of. “ I was 71,” says Mrs. Fuller, “ when I
lost my footing while ascending the stairs, sus-
taining a fractured arm and broken collar bone.
I became an inmate of the Sydney Hospital for
two months and was discharged as cured. My
worst trouble, however, was now about to begin.
In my fall I must have injured the kidneys, for a
dull continuous pain set in in that region which
gave me no rest by day or night. Obstinate
constipation and urinary difficulties were soon
added to my troubles, arising, I believe, from the
same cause. I visited the leading hospitals as an
out-patient, and was also under treatment at my
own home by a lady doctor; but none of the
plasters, liniments, lotions, or other medicines
they gave me, proved of the least use. As time
passed the pain in my back increased so much
that the agony was intolerable, and I felt as if I
could have welcomed death. Such was my con-
dition for two years, when my daughter, Mrs. W.
Johnson, of Arden-street, Waverley, gave me
three of Mother Seigel’s Soothing Plasters, a box
of Seigel’s Operative Pills, and a bottle of Seigel’s
Curative Syrup. The plasters, used in conjunction
with the Syrup and Pills, at once reduced the
backache, and the bowels and other internal
organs, were soon brought into proper working
order. I could eat, sleep, and get about again,
and, in three months, was as well as a woman of
my years could hope to be.”
For many years physicians were of opinion that,
when the human body had reached the age of
three score and ten, it was no longer responsive to
even the most appropriate remedies. That opinion
is now no longer held, and the case of Mrs. Fuller
again disproves it.

Dear Sirs, —It gives me great pleasure to state, in answer to your letter, that my health is
very much improved since I have been wearing the Electric Belt I got from you. The very
second time I put it on I could feel the benefits immediately, and I have been only wearing it
six weeks to-night. I feel very much better all over my body, and whereas it was a misery before
to sit down or walk before I got the Belt, now it is just a pleasure. The day I left my home to
see you I had no life in ine, and felt as though life was a burden to me, and, as it was, I was
simply a “ walking misery.” But I thank God I came to you for the Belt, and I cannot tell you
how glad I am, for I feel so much better, especially .with the pains in my legs ; in fact, I am
better all over, and it is just wonderful. You can do what you like with this letter, and if it will
be of any benefit to let my fellow-sufferers know, I will be only too pleased for them to write to me,
when I will be able to tell them how bad I really was before I got the Belt. lam telling my own
personal friends all about the wonderful cure, and I do not want to make any secret of it at all.
I am, yours very gratefully,
(Signed) WILLIAM CLOUTEN.

SPORTING NOTIONS.
Smallest field (7) of the day lined up for Warwick
Handicap, Saturday, though 2 to 1 more money induce-
ment was offered than that in connection with any other
of the six events. Dottswood was favorite at “ two’s,”
but winner turned up in the syr.-old Abercorn-Ruskinite
horse Ruskin, who easily won right through the 10fur.,
and gave most turf-followers a big knock. When ridden
to the front in other races he generally fell back before
the journey’s close. Several hundreds to 10 and 12 were
taken by those posted, but Mo. garnered a heap of bets
through Dottswood, Clangour, Nahpro and Spring Rose,
all of whom had troops of supporters at shorter prices
than the ultimate winner.
* * • *
Plain Tom 11. and Alannah were served up
uncommonly warm for Warwick Farm Flying Stakes,
though, through known connection between their respec-
tive owners, cutest punters wouldn’t swallow that each
was a legitimate trier. Loudly-voiced good thing, Rose
Petal, of recent A. J.O. and City Tatt’s meetings, was most
in request, and she won nicely from Alannah and
Plain Tom as named. Rose Petal is by Grand Flaneur
from Rosecleer, by Trenton. S.T.O. Nursery Handicap
fell to her, but since then she finished nowhere in first
and second A.J.O. Nurseries, and though weightily
backed, failed to fill a place in City Tatt’s Youthful
Stakes. This filly is unquestionably speedy, but un-
reliable, and plays up too much at the post to encourage
investments.
* * * •
Grafnell, the promising winner of Warwick
Farm Pace Welter, will always be worth an investment
whenever the right money comes. Though he failed to
show among the first seven in Novice Handicap at City
Tatt.’s Randwick meet a fortnight before, he was, last
Saturday, backed down to “evens” in a field of 13, and
won as if out for an exercise spin. He is a great raking
three-year-old gelding by Grafton from Little Nell.
Trainer “ Billy ” Frost has only just come back to the
game after 12 months’ suspension. The luck of it.
• • • *
Marvellous what a difference two or three days
make in the form of Sydney nags. Saturday The Persian
and Burraneer were hopelessly beaten at Canterbury,
and yet, four days later, former gathered in Welter Han-
dicap and latter the principal race of the programme at
Newcastle. The Persian went out at evens, and Burra-
neer 5 to 1 against.
* * * '■ *
S. Mo. reports best biz. for years over Good-
wood Handicap; Cup. Handicapper Hughes’ well-
judged weighting has brought much backing for many
nags. About a dozen in the Goodwood have been coupled
with everything having a chance for the Cup. Looks as
if Trochen or Kingston should get away with the first,
though there are others who’ll surely make the finish
interesting. Field for the Cup doesn’t read as strong as
that for the shorter race. Flagship stands out despite
his recent failure at Moonee Valley, which is explained by
the fact that he suffered the heavy handicap of running
on the outside all the way round a cramped course—a big
disadvantage. Another thing in his favor as against then
is that he will hump 7.12 instead of 9.6. Idler and Sport
Royal are other candidates with good prospects.

Winner (Glenloth, by Glenmarkie—The Gem) of
Melbourne Cup in ’92 dropped dead at Tarpeena (Vic.)
last week through a ruptured blood-vessel in the head.
Glenloth had been at the stud for years, and was being
prepared to run at Oasterton meeting. His appropriation
of Melb. Cup will not be soon forgotten ; he won literally
floundering in mud, and did the ring such a huge turn
that the smile of satisfaction at the result never left Mo’s
classic mug for months. Latest owner (Mr. H. M. Egan)
is said to have refused £l5O for him only just before.

Oudeis mare Ross, winner of Wagga Cup last
week, has paid for her oats for many a day ahead. Last
season she ran 30 times at N.S.W. country meetings and
annexed Murrumbidgee Riverina Plate (8.6), Wagga
Boxing Day Handicap (9.12), Adelong Farewell Handicap
(9.5), Tumberumba Handicap (9.5) and Forced Handicap
(9.5), Gundagai R.C. Handicap (8.9) and Town Plate (9.6),
Tumut Town Plate (9.7), Junee Clarendon Handicap (9.5),
Murrumbidgee Town Plate (9.6), Lockhart Handicap (9.8),
and Albury Citizens’ Handicap (9.7). Among other wins
since, Junee Farewell Handicap (8.8), Wodonga Handicap
(9.2) and Flying Handicap (9.3), and Wagga Publicans’
Purse (9.5) have been added to the list. Wagga Cup was,
years ago, worth £lOOO to the winner.

A woman lately applied to drive her own neddy
in a bracelet event at a Christchurch (M.L.) trotting
meet, and the committee-men were wondering what to do
about it, when someone unearthed a regulation that
drivers had to wear white pants and top-boots. Then
they declined the application.
* * * *
Bataillous —Miss Newbold Byr. old nag Boscobel
gathered in the big event (April Hep., 11m.) at Brisbane
latt.’s meet. Despite that at latter end of season before
last there was talk of withdrawing him from racing,
Boscobel has, during past eight months, figured in 30
races and won 10.

M.L. nag Menschikoff abandons racing for
stud duty at Wellington Park. In 18 starts he got home
14 times —10 as a 2yr. old, and at 3yrs. the money fell to
him every time he started.
* • • *
T. (after a well-known Sydney solicitor and
M.L.0.) apparently carries something of the curse nature,
as, when there’s little or no demand, he runs well enough,
then, next time, punters tumble over each other to get
money at any price, and he finishes second or third—
second mostly. Saturday was no exception. On what
they saw at Canterbury, a week previously, guns, touts,
and backers generally went bald-headed for T.M.S. in
Warwick Farm Stewards’ Mile, sending him out hot with
“ two’s,” the best available, but he could get no nearer
than a not-by-any-means meritorious second to the well-
bred Light Artillery-Lady Lovelace 3-yr.-old filly Fanfare,
who surprised most people.
• * * •
A generous M.L. person, who drew a big prize
in “ Tatt’s.” a while back, was asked by a priest for a
donation towards building an inconsequential country
church, and he wrote a cheque for the whole job. The
remainder of his cash he boozed away and went to utter
ruin. The priest got him three billets, but he lost them
all and, in despair, went to the sorrowful father and
implored one more chance. The cleric gave him a severe
lecture, a draft for £l5, got him a billet on board a liner,
and shipped him off to the Coronation.
The dual-dividend system is proving a facer for
the crowd of bookies who compete with the machine in
M. L. They have lost grasp of a stack of coin since its
initiation, and as some hot, straight-out coups have been
landed since Xmas., the bigger men have a bad pain
under their weskit. Some of the badly stricken gentry
lowered the “ limit,” and decided not to lay over a certain
amount each fancied neddy. But far-off, big punters,
whose names are as good as gold, have been wickedly
flattening out this little scheme by delaying sending their
wires until it was too late for poor bookie to reply that
he couldn’t do it. It’s time the public had a look in,
anyway, and it has a better show of handling Ikey’s money
under the new system than previously.

In re M.L. turfite G. C. Stead. His £1825
haul at recent Canterbury J.O. Autumn meet brings his
spoil in stake-money for this season alone to £11,795 (a
record for the colony), and judging by prospects there’s a
chance of further loot. He bought Menschikoff as a
yearling for 210g5., garnered £6BOO in stakes with him,
and then sold the gold-mine to the nag’s breeder for
600g8. Canterbury (M.L.) J.O. Champagne Stakes have
fallen to Mr. Stead every year for the past 10.

Threat of Federal P.M.G. to “catalogue and
gazette” names of advertising Mo’s as persons to whom
letters may not be delivered has materially affected the
income of the sporting press, as, for fear of being
specially named, Mo has ceased advertising. Meanwhile
his business prospers as merrily as ever, and even
“Tatt.’s” sweeps show little falling off, for the latest
closed with 25,000 subscribers—particularly good for a
minor event.

Australian all-round swimmer Dick Cavill
goes London wards by the German boat Weimar this
Saturday to take on the best of the ’Ome product.
Cavill carries much higher credentials than Read, who
preceded him by a month or so, and whom he (Cavill)
easily accounted for whenever they met during the con-
tinent’s Championship Carnival at Wanganui (M.L.).
Unfortunately, through Read’s friends having canvassed
exhaustively before, the Cavill expenses fund won’t
exceed £7O, which is much short of what is necessary,
but “Dick” insists upon going, though friends
foretell he’ll fall below doing himself justice—
deficient in funds, without friends, and handicapped by
his possibly unchecked boyish tendency to treat things
anything but seriously and get outside all sweets, ginger-
beer and such like, in sight. With a shrewd, well-
balanced, well-fixed (financially) man behind him Cavill
would have big possibilities ahead, but as things are the
outlook isn’t too assuring, though it might result dif-
ferently.
* * • •
Hoped now that N.S.W. crew for inter-State
8-oar race in Adelaide Saturday next week will show
better than any of years past. They’ve come on a great
deal lately, and dip and lift in unison, catch crisply, and
work shoulders and legs very satisfactorily. Unfortuna-
tely coach Brotherton, who has brought his charges up to
their present pitch of excellence, couldn’t leave with them
Tuesday and will not be over for the race, which means a
big loss, as had he been able to stay to the end further
improvement was certain. Victorians will take a lot
of beating. Their catch is even and leg-work near
perfection though ’tis complained that bow side
is weak compared with stroke. Melbourne row-
ing men generally are very confident. Bananalanders
are still, at time of writing, as originally chosen, men
who dropped out having come back again, rendering the
combination the best possible. Their stroke is short and
hard with a strong kick in the leg work—much more
American than English. This manner of doing the thing
isn’t the least bit favored among Southern State
rowers, though Northerners swear by its efficacy. Wes-
tralians have chopped and changed so much that few of
the first eight selected will row. South Australians are
locally considered a capital team likely to put up a great
race. Interesting that Vic., Q., and W. A. teams will all be
boated by the Melbourne firm of builders, Messrs.
Edwards and Sons.

“Brumby”: A well-known N.S.W. boat pro-
prietor, once a prominent oarsman, on one occasion
caused a deluge of blasphemy amongst the cunning
crowd who called him “ friend.” In a match “ arranged”
between him and a lesser light he was, as usual, made a
hot favorite by the public, while the cognoscenti went
around with a vacant expression, taking the odds. The
“ finish ” led past a concourse of the Uppah Ten who had
all plunged more or less on the favorite ; and, as the
latter came opposite them, hanging on to his opponent,
but seemingly out of it and falling behind, there came a
roar from the naicest barrackers : “ Bravo, Mr. Blank ” ;
“You’ve got him”; “Go on, Neddy.” The wise ones
sniggered, but suddenly, in the midst of the clamour,
Neddy’s head went down and in a magnificent spurt he
led past the post by a couple of lengths. Those yells had
roused Neddy's sporting-blood; and, as he afterwards
explained to his abusive clique, “ he ’ad to do it or bust.”
What a ray of sunshine for the poor punter if something
of this kind were to occasionally occur at Sydney pony-
meetings 1

The Continent’s top rung amateur sculler J. J.
Daley is in good fettle for the Commonwealth champion
sculls at Adelaide, Saturday next, when he’ll probably
meet Queenslander Slack and Tasmanian Bourke who
gave him a close call in Sydney a month or two since.

A peculiar happening at Sydney Cricket
Ground t’other day: Sydney first and Sydney second
(batting on different wickets) notched 100 at exactly the
same time, and were together at 152 and 183.
» * • *
The present Australian XI. is nicely balanced
in the matter of age. In 1899, all the 14 were 30 or there-
abouts, except Worrall (who was more), and Noble, Hill,
and Trumper. This time, there are six old stagers, 32
this year, or over, and five 25 or under, with only Noble,
Hopkins and Saunders to bridge the gap. The two
last-named have had their chance comparatively
late—at 27. Armstrong is the junior of the team, but he
is not so young as Hill and Trumper were last time (to
say nothing of what Hill was the time before). Trumble
and Kelly are easily the seniors, as both will be 35 their
first month in England ; but there is nobody as old as
Worrall was in 1899, or Giffen in 1896. In fact, 12 years
covers the lot.

Bananaland abo. bowler Henry compares un-
favorably in appearance with Marsh, being the ordinary
lean, lank, and unbeautiful native. Marsh, nattily put
together, johnny-like-attired, uncommonly intelligent, is
rather good-looking. For half-dozen or so overs Henry
drives the leather faster than Jones ever did, and pro-
mises much with proper guiding. In the field he works
capitally, but pumps himself out early through wanting
to do the work of the other nine.

Writes “ Scrip ” : The scheme projected a while
back to send a M.L. Rugby team to England can’t be
carried out, as the conditions under which they’d play
would make them pros. Rugby is a strictly amateur
game in M.L., and men would have to be paid for the
trip. Well, I can’t see why M L. Rugby Union should be
so very conservative in the matter ; an exception ought
to be made in such cases on the broad ground that it’s in
the interests of the game. ’Ome-Australasian matches
should be encouraged just as is the great cricket curse.
Englishers could be induced to repay visits. We see far
too little English Rugby in Australasia. To my mind,
we’d be all the better for more of it. So far as amateurism
is concerned—well, I’ve long ago given up consideration
of the subject. The line of demarcation seems to be about
100yds. broad.

Concluding tussle of Sydney bowling Pennant
matches on Ohatswood green this Saturday should result
interestingly and be as exciting as bowls can be. Teams left
in (City and Petersham) vanquished all others without
going under once. Conditions called for two defeats
before any club dropped out, hence City and Petersham
had to meet twice, or thrice if necessary. Three weeks
ago City fairly romped home and were so certain of
victory again last Saturday that they had the photogra-
pher of a Sydney weekly on the green “ taking ” them as
the absolute winners. They delayed so much in posing that
t’other side was on the point of claiming the match
through the opposition not being up to time. City were
very much second from the start and went under by 81,
losing in two rinks and tieing in a third. Sydney bowling
hasn’t for long known such a set back, and fact of losers
being so aggressively cock sure of success rendered their
downfall very palatable to bowlerdom generally.

Sydney lightweights are apparently suffering a
veritable M’Gowan scare. Though they’ll go into a ring,
ostensibly to fight, only the ropes prevent them getting
out into the street when Mac. lays his ears back and
rushes. Deep-chested, powerfully shouldered, sturdily
underpinned, and with the biceps and forearms of a 6ft.
weight-lifter, M'Gowan’s appearance is enough to win
fights. His latest victim, ex-Broken Hill miner Mat
Mitchie, stripped, trained to the hour, and looked every
way the man for the job, but, though a rough, forceful
fighter, and apparently bubbling over with grit ordinarily,
he got the shakes in front of M'Gowan, and laid himself
out to keep as far off the chances of harm as possible.
Mitchie fighting on that occasion and Mitchie fighting
with Irishman Denny Maloney, recently, were widely
different people. Difficult to say who of Australia’s 10
stoners will stand up with M'Gowan, unless Bob Turner,
and, though he thrives on punishment, it’s odds on him
going under inside, perhaps, a dozen rounds. M'Gowan
has been fighting as often as opportunity allowed for 13
years, is a twice-married man, and the father of two
families, and yet looks no more than a boy now.

Westralian Dunn and Sydney pug “Bull”
Nicholls struggled through a bitter bout at Sydney Golden
Gate A. 0., Saturday night. Dunn showed more cleverly than
Nicholls, but latter seemed ironclad, for Dunn’s punches
only made him snort and come in head-down for more,
till an opening showed, when Dunn winced from some
shattering thumps about the ribs. Frequently
Nicholls wobbled and staggered, and the Westralian
would operate to finish, but Newtown’s champion kept
going. Spite of furious onslaughts and damaging two-
arm work he stayed, and a full house howled
delightedly. In the last few rounds Nicholls petered out
some, but Dunn kept scoring tellingly, though he couldn’t
find a weak spot for a knock-out punch. The opening of
the ninth 3min., found Nicholls in dire trouble, his
“corner” elevated the “wipe,” and the crowd roared
applause for a fight that was a fight, and not a boxing
match. Nicholls, especially, did the rough-and-tumble
act all the time, hence, probably, “ Bull.”

Marvellous how erstwhile clever Australian
middleweight Jim Hall dodges death. Years ago he was
stabbed by a sailor during a “rough-up” in a Woolloo-
mooloo pub, twice he was “ knifed ”in America—once by
his manager ; then we heard that he was a hopeless case
of consumption and he wouldn’t live a month ; next came
the news that Hall had picked up wonderfully and was
getting right again. Three months ago American news
told that the same man fell in the street the victim of
severe internal hemorrhage, and it would be a miracle if
he survived a week. Now ’tis told a recovery, good
enough to warrant the opinion that he will with care last
years longer, has taken place. Jim’s a veritable human
cat, apparently.

Sydney mannikin pug “ Tibby ” Watson (7.10),
after a satisfactory trial at the swell National Sporting
Club, London, was matched with admitted good ’un
Fitzpatrick, who is taller, much heavier, and in
prime trim. Watson got in some forceful work on
the body, and spite of the re-opening of an old cut
over the right eye, got the money at end of sixth round.
London Sportsman cracks him up considerably and fairly,
but as “Tibby” proved no wonder here, the material
“ down under” is apparently very decadent.

Chances of Armidale (N.S.W.) bruiser M‘Coll
fighting ’Murkan Scanlan are improving. Mac wants
at least a £5O side bet and the venue at Newcastle, and,
as Scanlan agrees, matters may be clinched any time.
Mick Dunn, his coach, reports Scanlan improved out
of knowledge, but, all the same, M’Coll is sure to
start first choice, as New England will stump out to a
man on his chance, Winner of this may meet Australian
premier heavy pug, Bill Doherty, or claim the belt if he
won’t come.

Yic. pro. peds. kicked against the management
of Melbourne Eight-hour Sports enforcing betting sup-
pression measures, t’other day, and struck in a body,
spite of sec. de Gruehy’s pleadings. Some spoke plainly,
and said, as prize-money wouldn’t go round in paying
proportions, Mo.’s presence was necessary to prevent loss
to them. One entrant coolly stated that he had no hope
of winning a race, but the day’s running was always as
good as a tenner to him. Strike ended second day by the
committee refusing to budge and the starters starting
and betting on the quiet. This action is a severe
facer for professional running, which is much more
vigorous in Victoria than in any other State. There’s a
pedestrian council there and greater and more frequent
opportunities for raking in coin at the game are provided.
The cinder path man will probably move to O’Sullivan’s
State now and join the unemployed, as his occupation is
almost completely gone ; there’s no encouragement at all
for him in any other section of the Commonwealth, thanks
to his dark ways and mean tricks.

The parts of the cycle most needing proper atten-
tion are the tyres, upon which nearly all of the driving
strain falls. Cyclists can learn everything re cycle tyres
from the Dunlop company’s fine booklet, “ All About
Dunlop Tyres,” which they offer to post gratis to any
cyclist who applies for a copy.*
* » • *
Riding tyres in a slack condition is very con-
ducive to sideslip. A tyre that can be blown “ board-
hard ” without any risk, and still be resilient, is the Dunlop.
Now that the wet season will soon be with us, cyclists
should note that sideslipping on wet and greasy roads is
more likely to happen when the tyres are ridden soft.”
The glorification by B. R. Wise at a
Sydney banquet of blood-drunk Seddon, because
he is blood-drunk, shows a lamentable falling-off
from the Wise who, a decade ago, referred to the
Soudan contingent as a “lamentable eccentricity”
and on the subject of Imperial Federation wrote:
Union with England we gladly believe will come ; but
it must be the union of an equal with an equal, and not
the union of a superior with a subordinate : so that it is
no paradox to say that the first step towards union must
be Separation.
S.M, Herald, April 25, ventured, in a
leader, on a philosophical disquisiton as to the
“Increasing tendency on the part of members (of
Parliament) to sink their individual responsibility,” and
the “ decay of that governing faculty or instinct which it
has taken years of free institutions to cultivate.”
Thus it delivered itself, bound hand and foot,
into the hands of W. A. Holman, M.P., who,
wielding a trenchant pen, pointed out to the
Herald how he refused to “sink his individual
responsibility,” and didn’t allow his “governing
faculty or instinct, cultivated by free institutions,”
to decay, but on the question of the S’African
war ventured to differ from Mr. Chamberlain and
agree with Mr. Gladstone, John Ruskin, Herbert
Spencer, and other Englishmen of that stamp;
and the sort of treatment he got from the Jingo
daily press in Australia in consequence. Mar-
vellous to relate, the Herald published the
letter.
Melbourne Age, in its leading article of
9th April, booms up the Tory legend that
Australia is a country that is governed on a
hideously expensive plan (i-e., that the local Fat-
man is oppressed with heavy taxation which
should be cut down) after this fashion:
In a similar manner the extraordinary rate of public
expenditure in Australia is often attempted to be
explained away, and to some extent improperly In the
following figures railway expenditure has been eliminated
so as to make the comparisons fair:— ’
Expenditure
Per Capita.
United Kingdom .. _ .. £2 19 i
United States '. 1 16 4
Chief Continental Countries .. .. 2 3 1
Australia . 6 6 7
There is a pretence of fairness about this which is
calculated to impose on the multitude, but it is
really a shameful fake in the interests of the
growing Tory conspiracy, and some features of
the fake are these:
(1) Only half the Australian railway expenditure has
been eliminated. The expense of running the railways is
certainly deducted, but the interest on their cost isn’t.
That knocks about £1 6s. a year off the Australian figure
and reduces it to £5.
(2) No mention is made of the fact that the Australian
expenditure covers the whole cost of police, charities
and education, which are not included in the British
figures, these items being mostly charged to local rates
in the United Kingdom.
(3) No mention is made of the fact that the Australian
figures cover old age pensions in two States (there are no
old age pensions in the U.K.), and much road and bridge
expenditure (paid by local taxation in the U.K.)
(4) The United States figures are faked by taking only
the Federal expenditure, and leaving out the almost
equally large State expenditure. Also no mention is
made of the fact that there is no interest on railway debt,
and no expenditure on telegraphs in the U.S. budget!
railways and telegraphs being private monopolies.
(5) In the figures for Continental Europe the writer
apparently takes the German Imperial expenditure only,
and leaves out the expenditure of the States. In like
manner if the Australian Federal expenditure only were
taken Australia would appear as almost the most cheaply-
governed country in the world.
In short, the whole affair is a conspiracy on the
part of a very lightly-taxed propertied class to
make out a case for a further reduction of its
burdens. And its ways of making out a case are
remarkable, to say the least.
Premier Barton has suspended the opera-
tion of the law against the importation of nigger
labor for three months so far as the pearl-shelling
industry is concerned, in order that he may think
over the matter. Will Mr. Barton explain
exactly what thinking over it requires ? It is
known to every person of reasonable intelligence
that the pearl-shelling industry was worked by
white men till about a dozen years ago. There-
fore it can be worked by white men. The fact is
as well-known now as it will be three months
hence. The cheap-nigger bosses will be no more
willing to give up their black labor three months
hence than they are now. A White Australia
will be as essential three months hence as it is
now. The only thing gained is that a weak, futile,
half-hearted Premier gets three months rest from
trying to make up his mind.

Hospitals and Doctors Fail—Dr. Morse’s
Indian Root Pills Permanently Cure. His
Kidney Aches, Gravel and Stone.
The following letter speaks louder than words,
and again demonstrates the fact that Dr. Morse’s
Indian Root Pills cure after other so-called
remedies fail. The evidence is such that it
carries conviction to the most doubting, and yet
it is only one letter from among many:—“ 28
Bay-street, Glebe, Sydney, N.S.W., Ist October,
1901. The W. H. Comstock Co., Ltd., 58 Pitt-
street, Sydney. Dear Sirs. For nearly twenty
years I have been a sufferer from gravel and
stone, and was compelled to give up my position
in Sydney. I took a position as boundary rider
on the ‘ Clifton Grove ’ Station, in Orange, hoping
to receive some benefit, but later was compelled
to give that up also. I have been in several
hospitals in Sydney and elsewhere, without
getting any relief. No one knows the intense
agony I have suffered, and I was becoming
despondent after being treated by doctor after
doctor without getting any benefit. Seeing an
advertisment of Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills
in the Bathurst Advocate I determined to give
them a trial, and bought a bottle at Dalton’s, in
Orange. They gave me relief at once, and lam
increasing in flesh daily. I cannot speak too
highly of them, and can only urge anyone suffering
as I have done to give them a trial. I should
be pleased to answer any who care to com-
municate with me regarding my case. You are
at liberty to make use of this as you think fit.—
Yours very truly, J. W. Richards.” Dr. Morse’s
Indian Root Pills are a perfect blood purifier, and
a positive cure for biliousness, indigestion, con-
stipation, headaches, sallow complexion, liver
and kidney troubles, piles, pimples, boils and
blotches, and for female ailments. Sold by
chemists and storekeepers. Is. ljd per bottle, or
six bottles 6s. 6d. Packed in amber bottles, and
the full name blown thereon.

Hannan’s Oroya, still feebly fumbling for the
rich Iron Duke chute, must hit upon it some day.
Proper course would have been to have followed it from
the Iron Duke, but probably too great risk of gold-
robbery. Hannan’s Star mill been running on Oroya
stone for past three weeks, but no clean up to take place
till end of April. Plant treats 1800 tons monthly, so
should do well on for 3000 tons by then. Treatment-cost
said to be 465. a ton —quite a god-send for Star but the
devil for Oroya. Algernon Moreing, in advocating
amalgamation of three shows, stated that Brown Hill had
both oxidised and sulphide plants, and Oroya had not,
forgetting that Oroya has three Huntingdon mills in
about as dilapidated a condition as the Brown Hill coffee-
mills. In these Oapt. Parkes treated over 50,000 tons of
oxidised ore for an Bdwt. average at a gross cost per ton,
including mining and everything, of 16s. 8d. —a feat
Algernon is incapable of performing for various reasons.

Said to be upwards of 80 silver sections around
Zeehan (Tas.) held idle by reason of the vicious Flyspeck
mining regulations. Tributors would jump at the
chance of working many of these shows, but there seems
little desire on the part of leaseholders to have any work
done “just at present.” Miners bitterly declare that it
is useless putting in applications for forfeiture, as the
regulations and an easy-going Minister of Mines block
them every time. If forfeiture is applied for on the ground
of non-compliance with labor conditions, it appears that
the lessee is given three months to mend his ways. If he
fails to comply he may be fined £5. For a second offence
he gets another three months’ notice, and may be fined
£lO. Six months’ time is thus gained at a maximum cost
of £l5. On a third application for forfeiture being made
a further term of three months is given the leaseholder
to comply with the labor conditions 1 If he still fails, the
Minister may recommend forfeiture, or may impose a fine
of £25, or may suspend the labor conditions for any
term he thinks proper. Further, he may declare any
application for forfeiture frivolous, and impound the
applicant’s fee ; and if the average Tas. Minister doesn’t,
in addition, have the applicant prosecuted for disturbing
the blessed vested interests, it is only because he
doesn’tdesiretodrawtoo much attention to the workingof
his dreadful department and the rottenness of the law
that allegedly controls its proceedings. For enabling big
syndicates to starve working miners into accepting
almost any terms, Tas. mining laws and their adminis-
tration are evidently the best ever devised.

A seeming root of Mt. Bischoff (Tas.) has been
discovered through the apathy of a cow, belonging to a
farmer named Mayne, whose selection lies in the vicinity
of the boss tin mine. Mrs. Mayne picked up a stone to
throw at the dreamy milker, and the missile was so heavy
that she took it to her husband. He, finding it to be
pure tin oxide, started digging, and came to a 10ft. face
of t ; n ore s am pi es taken from the face yielded results
which give farmer Mayne the appearance of a mine-
owner. The luck of it ! Only a furlong away from the
spot where the stone was picked up the Orient co. of yore
was ted £30,000 in searching for black tin oxide, whilst
the grey oxide, such as Mrs. Mayne chucked at the cow,
was thought to be worthless stuff.

A correspondent:—“Mount Garnet railway
f rom Lappa Lappa (Chillagoe railway) will be open for
traffic in a day or two. The Garnet ore is a very basic
sulphide needing much highly silicious flux. This being
the case, general-manager Ashcroft has formulated a
tariff of returning charges, which is fairly acceptable to
the directors of Tartana, Ltd. Mt. Garne't can take 400
tons of silicious ore per week, and the Tartana people are
arranging to convey that quantity from Tartana Hill to
Mungana railway station (Chillagoe terminus)—ls to 16
miles road-carriage. Thence transport is easy : Rail 47
miles by Chillagoe railway to Lappa Lappa junction and
34 miles by Mt. Garnet railway. Probably the Bourke
Carrying Co., Abdul Wade, and the camels will convey 200
tons per week, and the local teamsters the balance, over the
road-portion of the journey. The consignments of ore will
be graded to average 15 per cent, copper. Estimated that
an average ofl 60 cubic ft. broken from the quarry face
(50ft. in height) will yield one ton of the necessary-grade
ore. The balance of the ore will be kept for leaching,
Ragging-up ore to such a high grade is not to be the
permanent policy-only until the leaching plant is ready,
In Brisbane the fact has been established with a working
model plant that 28 per cent, carbonates of copper (15 per
cent, metal) can be leached successfully successful!j
because the extraction equals 96 to 97 per cent. The
whole proposition is thus reduced to the problem of cost
of sulphuric acid at Tartana Hill. Mt. Morgan produces
chamber acid at 30s. per ton, but the road (15 miles)
and rail (156 miles) carriage of sulphur from Cairns to the
mine will bring the cost up to £3. Of course the manu-
facture of sulphuric acid (four tons from one ton of
gulphur) is pal | and parcel o v f a leach i„g plant. At the
outset sulphur will be imported, but directly the sulphide
zone of the mine is opened, the sulphide ore will be roasted
f or production of acid as at the Arizona and other
American mines. Working on the general average value of
Tartana Hill ore—7 to 8 per cent, copper, 66 per cent, silica,
4 per cent, iron—ls tons will produce one ton of metallic
copper. This will need one ton of sulphuric acid to
convert the carbonates into sulphates, which are soluble,
and can be washed out, and less than one ton of pig
j ron (£5) f or the precipitation vats. Allowing for all
sorts of contingencies, £1 should be ample to treat each
ton of crude ore. Then come the realization charges,
and the less said about those the better. Anyhow,
it seems that nothing can stop the Tartana (North
Chillagoe) group from being vigorously worked at last,
One of Tartana directors goes forthwith to America for
trained men in hydro-metallurgy of copper.”

caily and, on reputation, . J^. e J^nerts^to

Obit. : Joseph G. White, of Warrnambool
(Vic.), aged 85. He was the son of a Sydney
physician, and was born at O’Connell-st. in that
city in 1817. Deceased followed a sea-faring life
during the greater part of his career, and was for
a time master of vessels owned by the late Capt.
Grant, of Port Dairy.
George Meudell, the Melbourne broker
who is whooping up on his own account The
Bulletin’s financial gospel, wrote a cheeky letter
to Premier Jenkins, of S.A., the other day,
telling him: “Directly you announce your new
S.A. loan in London I warn you I shall stop it.”
In answer, Jenkins tells the story of the Cana-
dian-Indian who set out to stop an express
train, and lassoed it, whereby it came to pass that
a small piece of brown meat was afterwards
noticed trailing behind the engine. Very soon,
though, S.A. may have to sit down seriously and
decide whether its loan is the locomotive or the
Indian. _ Jenkins Iscariot takes it for granted that
his loan is the locomotive, but mistakes often arise
in such matters.
Premier Seddon’s ruffianly speech (as
reported) advocating that 5000 Maoris be sent
to S’Africa with full permission to conduct
their share of the war on principles of pure
barbarism. and with no regard whatever to
civilised ideas, and the greedy cadging of his
creatures for subscriptions to the rich man’s
cash. testimonial, have made many of his old
admirers feel very sick. The remorseless docking
of Is. each from a multitude of old age pensioners
towards Seddon’s purse of sovereigns is about the
lowest-down proceeding Maoriland remembers.
The testimonial is booming right enough, for the
old age pensioners’ subscriptions and the contri-
butions of public servants (who are afraid lest they
get the sack if they don’t subscribe) will save it
from failure if nothing else does, but a lot of public
contempt will go with the money. And if the
German papers take to publishing Seddon’s
alleged speeches as a fair sample of British
humanity it will probably get in the way of Dick’s
dukedom.

Or its tones can be modulated to the soft, sweet tones of the German Zither.
In addition to its wonderful tone quality, the Harp-Zither has a great many
advantages over all other Zithers. It is the only Zither which may be played
while holding vertically like the Harp, or it may be laid upon a table, as is
necessary with the ordinary Zither.
Observe the diagonally crossed strings, almost the same as in a piano, the
melody strings passing over the chord strings. By means of this improvement
in construction the similarity in tone and volume of the piano is produced.
Beautiful in Design, Grand, Resonant Tone, Perfection in Every Point,
and it is the easiest to learn to play of any musical instrument in existence.
A child can play it almost at sight. The reason anyone can play this instru-
ment on fi -st trial, even though the person may know absolutely nothing
about music, or may not have an ear for music, is this : Each string is num-
bered, as is each note in the music, so all one has to do to render the most
difficult selections is to strike the strings as indicated by the numbers; hence
we guarantee that anyone able to read figures can learn to play.
The Harp-Zither is built on the lines of the large harp which sells at
£2O and upwards, and to the astonishment of all the Harp-Zither has the
tone of the two ; in fact, its tone is similar to that of a piano.

As a parlor ornament, the instrument, with its classical outlines, is
unique. For the serenade, the musicale, or any class of entertainment, the
Harp-Zither excels all other instruments of its class. Its Deep, sympathetic
Tones Penetrate even those Insensible to the Charms of Music.
Style I. —Ebonised, piano finish, decorated, twenty-three strings, three
chords, two picks, key, case, full instructions, and a lot of figure music,

HERR RASSMUSSEN (HANS PETER RASMUSSEN),
The Celebrated Danish Botanist,
Proprietor and Discoverer of the World-Famed Alfaline Herbal Remedies,
which have been the means of effecting the most marvellous Cures for Blood,
Skin and Nervous Diseases ever heard of in Australia.
Herr Rassmussen’s Australian Career:
It is about Twenty Years since Herr
Rassmussen introduced his Herbal Remedies
to the Australian Public. At that time
he was only known to the public as a Botanist
pure and simple, having devoted almost his
whole life to the study of that most useful
and interesting branch of science. It how-
ever, soon dawned on Herr Rassmussen that
immense virtues existed in many plants which
were entirely unknown to medical men, and
that it was his duty towards his fellow man
to bring these new discovered Herbal Remedies
within the means of suffering humanity.
Herr Rassmussen at once set to work,
and his entire energy was directed towards
extracting the medical properties from all
kinds of plants, and putting them up in the
most suitable and practical form, according
to the nature of the complaints which they
had been found a cure for.
Pills and Powders were found to be the
most practical form to administer these new
Herbal Remedies.
It is unnecessary to particularise here the
immense success Herr Rassmussen met with
in his venture twenty years ago ; suffice it to
say that in less than twelve months the
great and wonderful cures brought about by
his Alfaline Herbal Remedies were known
throughout Australia, New Zealand, and many
other parts of the world. Testimonials and
Honors arrived from all parts. Gold Medals
from Paris and other places were awarded, and
Herr Rassmussen’s name has been a house-
hold word ever since. (Sydney Press.)

A case somewhat akin to that) of the two
Australian officers recently executed by order of
Kitchener, occurred at the siege of Delhi in the
Indian Mutiny. A captain took two princes
prisoners, and had marched them some distance,
intending to hand them over to the authorities,
when he grew tired and shot them both dead in
cold blood. Almost all the prisoners were
similarly disposed of, but owing to the rank of
these two the commander spoke rather crossly to
the officious captain.
Gov.-Gen. Hopetoun’s recent laudation of
the Cairns winter climate is the biggest puff that
district has had. In the course of time, Southerners
will probably realise that the greater part of North
Queensland, in place of being a bed of fever and
malaria, is really one of the healthiest countries on
earth. Very hot, it is true, in summer, and sultry
on the coast, but eminently salubrious, all the
same.


Nervous sufferers will find it worth their

_ The eminent Hygienic Scientist, Dr. GOODFELLOW, Ph.D., F.R.M.S., in a recent lecture to Hygiene students,
said: “We have seen from previous work that many hair lotions contain lead and other injurious constituents, but
that ‘ Koko,’ the type we have taken as the subject of our examination to-night, is not only a valuable tonic dressing
for the Hair, but is perfectly free from, all deleterious constituents.
“A perfect hair-dressing should fulfil, among others, the following essential conditions (1) It should be free
from all poisonous and deleterious substances. (2) Pleasant in odor or odorless. (3) It should not affect the natural
color of the hair. (4) It should give tone to the scalp and hair, assisting to restore the hair follicles to their normal
conditions, and promoting the natural nourishment of the hair roots. I can give no better example than * Koko.'
which w© have proved to fulfil these essential conditions.”
KOKO is sold by all Cliemists and Stores at l/- f 2/6 and 4/6 per bottle.

THE EIGHTEENTH REPORT OF THE DIRECTORS OF THE COLONIAL BANK OF AUSTRALASIA LIMITED.
To be presented to the Shareholders at the EIGHTEENTH ORDINARY GENERAL MEETING, to be held at
the Bank, 126 Elizabeth-street, at NOON on TUESDAY, 29th APRIL, 1902.

THE DIRECTORS beg to submit to the Shareholders their Eighteenth Report, with a Balance-sheet and State-
ment of Profit and Loss, for the half-year ended 31st March, 1902, duly audited.
After providing for expenses of Management, Interest accrued on Deposits, Rebate on Bills
Current, Tax on Note Circulation, and making provision for Bad and Doubtful Debts, the net
profits amount to £17,172 13 2

The last two instalments of the Deferred Deposit Receipts, due in 1905-6, were paid on 30th December last, and
the bank has now paid all the liabilities of the old bank, which removes the restriction to the payment of dividends
on the ordinary shares.
The Directors, in view of the increase in the bank’s profits, feel justified in recommending that in addition to the
dividend on the Preference Shares, a dividend be paid on the Ordinary Shares at the rate of 5 per cent, per annum.
In co lsequence of the payment of the balance of the Deferred Deposit Receipts, the seats of Sir Rupert T. H.
Clarke, Baronet, Mr. Thomas Russell, and Mr. James Moloney, who represented the Deferred Deposit Receipt
holders on the directorate, became vacant; and the board, under the powers conferred upon it by the Articles of
Association, filled up the vacancies by the appointment of Messrs. Thomas Russell, James Moloney, and John Todd ;
who, with the other Directors, now represent the Shareholders.
The Dividend will be payable at the Head Office on and after the 30th inst., and at the branches on receipt of advice.
The Eighteenth Ordinary General Meeting of Shareholders will be held at the Head Office of the company, 126
Elizabeth-street, Melbourne, on Tuesday, the 29th day of April, 1902, at noon.

MILLER’S FEATHER SHOP,
Corner Bourke & Swanston sts., Melbourne
The little Isle of Man, half-way between
England and Ireland, has just shown its inde-
pendent frame of mind. It has its own Parlia-
ment, and is only loosely kept in hand by an
English Governor (fancy sending out a Governor
to a place right in the middle of the. U.K. !)
Lately its legislators resolved to come into line
with the British law of married women’s property,
as passed 20 years ago ; but they also absolutely
declined to do away with the old-fashioned
widow’s right of dower. After which, to show
that they were not really behind the times, they
penalised the selling of cigarettes to boys, and at
a stroke abolished the crying evil of brewers’ tied
houses, which other legislatures have not yet had
the courage to tackle.
An English lady has a letter from Barnum
Powell “ apologising for writing to her in pencil
and with his left hand, on the ground that his
Tight hand and the pen and ink were engaged in
writing dispatches ! ” Can’t Harry Rickards or
Fitzgeralds’ circus get this gentlemen for an Aus-
tralian season ?
Inspector Cameron, who has become
Superintendent of Police, has received more testi-
monials in the way of watches, chains and lockets
than, perhaps, any other member of the N.S.W.
Force. He holds a unique gift from the
pastoralists of Queensland and N.S.W. combined
for his border work at Moree. He chased the
Breelong blacks, cornered Glasson, and pursued
sheep-stealers uncountable.

The Wrong Mr. Wright, if he does nothing
else, gives a very effective reply to Juliet’s naive
inquiry, “ What’s in a name ? ” In the right
name or the right brand there is everything. The
right brand of Whisky is D.C.L. every time.
D.C.L. is the delectable fluid which assists the
business man to profitable cash conclusions, the
author, actor, orator and artist to brilliant in-
spiration, the philanthropist in good doing ; adds
to everyone’s happiness and is everywhere known
as The Whisky of the Wise.*
New Zealand Loan and Mercantile Agency Co.,
Ltd. Wheat report: Though the market has lost its
excited state lately referred to, values continue on the
firm basis then noted, sales have been limited locally in
consequence of the small quantity offering-, but in the
country districts considerable clearances have been made
in many instances for the purpose of feeding starving
stock on a basis equal to 4s. 3d. to 4s. 4d. per bushel at
the seaboard.*
In these swift-moving days nothing goes ahead
like goaheadedness, and when you see a business man
adopting enterprising and novel methods for attracting
oublic attention, it is safe to predict a success for him.
Mr. Meyers, of the London Tailoring 00., Bourke-st.,
Melbourne, who has elbowed his business right into the
front rank and a little ahead of it, is now about to break
out in a new place, viz., the premises at the junction of
Bourke and Elizabeth-sts., known to everyone who knows
Melbourne as Che “Bee-Hive Corner.” And when Mr.
M. has converted the said premises into a palatial store,
Melbourne will have such an artistic display of artistically
made raiment as the city never saw before.*

nervous sick headache, and neuralgia.
Your food distresses you. You are
“all tired out,” and you suffer from
terrible depression.
Ayer’s Sarsaparilla
is what you need. It keeps you up
when especially pressed with work. It
cures dyspepsia, and it builds up ex-

Pure, rich blood, a strong digestion,
a clear skin, steady arid vigorous
nerves; these may all be yours if you
only use this great blood-purifying and
blood-forming medicine.

FREE TO THE
RUPTURED.
Dr. W. S. Rice, the well-known New York Hernia
Specialist, sends a trial of his famous method FREE
TO ATiTj. Anyone can now cure themselves at
home without pain, danger, operation, or an hour’s
loss of TIME FROM WORK.
At the earnest request of British patrons, Dr. Rice
has opened Branch Offices at 9d Stonecutter St,
London, E.C., and to the thousands upon thousands
of ruptured people who are torturing themselves
with bad trusses, arid are in momentary danger of
death from strangulation, will send free to all a
trial of his famous method that has saved so many
lives and made so many men, women, and children
well and strong and permanently cured of Lad Rup-
tures, Do not be backward about writing lor the
FREE TRIAL. It will cost you nothing, and will
enable you to see how easily you can cure yourself
in a short time without losing an hour ,rom work.
Dr. Rice is determined that every suffering man or
woman shall know the wonderful truth that Rupture
can be cured, and he therefore generously sends,
prepaid by post, his method absolutely free, and you
can make a trial of it. Remember that it is the
same method that Mr. Thomas Blay (whose picture
is given below) used ; and who can deny the truth
when it is put before them in so clear a light ? It
must indeed, be welcome words to the afflicted.

WORDS OF PRAISE FROM Mr. BLAY.
No. 5, Ripley Terrace, Luddenden Foot,
W. S. Rice. April, 6,1901.
Dear Sir,—After using your treatment for three
months I find myself cured of my Rupture, at the
age of 55. I had been ruptured for ten years.
I shall advise all people afflicted with this com-
plaint to use your treatment, as I know from
experience that it will cure permanently. You must
have a wonderful knowledge of rupture to fit.one
so perfectly without seeing the rupture.
I am in good health now, something I have not
enjoyed for ten years before. You can use this
letter in any way you choose, and I hope it will
guide others to a perfect cure.—Yours truly,
° nn TIT A V
There is absolutely no question about the curative
ability of this combined and perfected method. It
has stood the test of time; it has been through the fire
of critical cases; it has come out victorious in every
curable instance. It has saved the child to a life of
independence; it has given the youth his natural
endowment of health and strength to fight the battle
of life successfully; it has conquered the blight upon
old age and turned years of suffering into ending
days of joy and giadness. Whoever is Ruptured, or
knows a person suffering with Rupture, should keep
in mind the fact that in eighty per cent, of all cases
there is a daily liability that before night they may
say good-bye to earthly things. Does not this fact
influence one to pause and consider whether they
are using their best efforts in the way a wise Creator
intended they should? And if the forethought, the
research, and the painstaking effort of,one who
invents and studies for the relief of others is placed
in our hands, is it not our duty to read and listen
patiently,that we may take advantage of that which
contributes to our earthly benefit?

The “Allenburys” Foods provide nourishment suited to the growing digestive powers
of the Infant, and constitute an altogether distinct advance on the mischievous expedient of trying
to make the child’s stomach accomodate Itself to a food essentially unsuited to its digestive powers.
Farinaceous foods of all kinds are totally unfit for infants under five or six months of age, such foods
being a potent cause of digestive troubles, rickets, and many disorders arising from mal-nutrition.
The “ Allenburys” Foods are especially valuable in hot
climates. They are in the form of powder and keep perfectly.

Melba, it is said, has ceased to interest herself in Regina
Nagel, and the “ career ” of that disappointing contralto
hangs fire. Miss Nagel must be nearly into her “thirties”
by this time. Her voice is one of the best without a
doubt, and well-trained, but something keeps her back.
Seemingly the “ Ben Bolt ” songstress lacks patience as
well as confidence.
When Wilson Barrett arrived in Melbourne last year he
got a mayoral reception at the Town Hall. When he
departed, from Melbourne for S’Africa last week he got
only a brief paragraph in the local press mentioning that
his Australian experiences have “inspired him to con-
struct” a novel and a dramatisation thereof, entitled
“ The Never-Never Land.” Barrett is a mechanist with
a good memory for points. The term “Never-Never
Land ” cropped up frequently in Haddon Chambers’s first
play—“ Captain Swift ’’—and it will serve as a reminiscent
advt., so to speak, for W.B.’s dual “construction.” He
threatens to produce the drama in Capetown.
“ S. Snell ” : If Geil, who is the star of the new U.S.
evangelical variety company, has not served his time as a
low comedian in the New York halls, he was born with a
decided list to the theatres, and drifted into a church by
mistake. He fetches the crowd for holiness and the plate
exactly as the Musical Burglar fetches ’em for fleshly
pleasure and the pay-box, and is the better comedian of
the two. His face-play is studied and elaborate, his
trickery of voice, action and expression absolutely
artificial. There is even a suspicion of make-up. Geil’s
face is the comedian’s unmistakable chiv, and he has the
comedian’s woeful lack of creative power as a humorist.
His stories are hash-hashed, old and stale, owing every-
thing to the telling. These Yank devil-chasers are having
a bigger success than the rival ’Murkan show, “The ,
Wrong Mr. Wright." If the Musical Burglar told ti.<- j
story of Jonah as comedian Geil does, he would be hiss. d
off as a blasphemer; but it is impossible to be irreverent
in a pulpit.
Amy Castles is fast degenerating in Australia into a
sectarian question, and the wearing of her portrait
threatens to become tantamount to singing “The
Wearin’ of the Green” on 12th July. The day after one
big concert in Melbourne, a girl “ of the wrong color”
strolled into the fashionable drapery establishment where
she is employed, and threw down the gage by referring to
“ last night’s failure.” Instantly half-a-dozen dark-eyed
colleens came from their respective counters to demand
an explanation. Then a few yellow supporters rallied,
and winged words flew around ; finally, one debater
clinched an argument by dragging down her opponent’s
hair. Then there was a wild whirl of skirts and stockings
as a dozen excited damsels clawed and banged one
another’s pretty faces in support of their respective
faiths, while sleek shopwalkers tried to tear them apart.
The riot was finally subdued, and the combatants distri-
buted to different parts of the shop, where they continued
to enrage the cat opposite by unrolling orange or green
fabrics on the counters upon the slightest provocation.
Melbourne Johnnies who remembered the lovely legs of
Palotta in the first “Gaiety Girl” production seven
years back, crowded to see the fair Austrian’s symmetrical
supports in the last act of “ Dorothy,” where the two
girls come out to the duel disguised as men. But dis-
appointment met them. The Palotta of seven years back
was not the one who presides over sassiety functions to-
day and is photo’d with the Naicest in the weekly crawl-
papers. While shapely Florence Young wore her long
coat quite open, Palotta’s was carefully buttoned over ;
her long-looked-for legs remaining hidden throughout
the act. Sassiety could not be expected to endure the
sight of the legs of one of its pets in anything less than
Rosalind, though some years back the smart daughter of
a Melb. University Prof, came out boldly to charm her
male acquaintances as principal boy of an amateur bur-
lesque show.
“F.R.”: Sydney Palace’s “Merry World” gives the
theatre-goer a good opportunity to contrast American
and English soubrette methods. Rose Hamilton is a
fairly representative sample of a successful English
comic-opera singer. She has a generous figure, is a fair
dancer, good singer—with a very clever method of putting
“ expression ” into her songs—and a not bad actress when
she does act, but that is not all the time she’s on the
stage. Rose Sutherland represents American methods :
small piquant figure; splendid dancer, especially in
eccentric lines; a “funny” singer, though her
voice has been rasped terribly by shouting coon
songs and Bowery sketches ; a most vivacious
actress who plays up to the audience every second
of the time —smiling, grimacing, posturing, laugh-
ing—and gives herself never a moment’s rest. The
American system of amusement runs to painstaking
detail. Every little incident is worked out and' every
second on the stage utilised for something. The British
system is one of haughty indifference to details. The
artiste does what she is billed to do, looks well, sings
well, supplies the number of smiles provided for in the
contract, and seems not to worry in the least about
extracting all the gold from a part. But it is no good
cyaniding the tailings after an American has been at
work.
The Christian Scientists seem to have captured a real
prize in Barthold, the German tenor, who appeared with
Musgrove’s co., last year. Barthold, handsome, grey and
spiritual-looking, should be a fine advt. for any craze he
may adopt. He is probably the brainiest student on the
operatic stage, for, although his Christian Science
enthusiasm suggests that he is a Wagnerian mystic, Bar-
thold has the reputation of being able to sing—on
demand—the tenor music of about 90 operas other than
the tumultuous works of the great Richard.
“ Dorothy,” at Williamson’s Melb. theatre, came like
mellow wine to the public, who had lately been imbibing
musical comedy soda-water after their doses of Italian
opera brandy. A delightfully tuneful thing, with enough
of Lauri Lurcher and massive Priscilla in it to please the
Philistines. Yet not at all a captivating show. The two
cousins—Dorothy and Lydia—couldn’t persuade anyone
that they were a pair of saucy young spinsters from
Chanticleer Hall masquerading as the daughters of a
rural pub.-keeper. Florence Young is too large and hard
for the part of dainty Dorothy. Grace Palotta’s coquet-
tish manner is town-bred and well-matured. But both
actresses appeared to advantage in their “ boy ” dis-
guises.
The Cornstalk law made a vigorous attempt
last week at Grafton to hang a man for the alleged
murder of a person whose alleged dead body can’t
be found, but failed to secure a conviction. _ A
Chinaman had gone away for a day or two leaving
his mate in charge of the house and vegetable
garden, and their hired Cingalese working cheer-
fully under his direction. He came back to find
no mate, no Cingalese, and no money, but sundry
bloodstains. The Cingalese was arrested with
money, believed to be that of the allegedly-dead
Chow, upon him, while either flying from justice
or else travelling like any other ordinary inhabi-
tant. The most energetic search failed to reveal
a scrap or vestige of the vanished Chow. The
Crown held that if a man could escape punishment
simply because he took reasonable pains to conceal
the body no one was safe. The defence held that
if, because a Chinaman repented of his sins after a
severe attaok of bleeding at the. nose, tried to
make reparation for his past avarice by giving a
few pounds to an honest black toiler, and then
withdrew himself from society to commune
with Joss, that black man could be arrested
while on his way home to his own
country and suspended by a rope, then
liberty had perished out of the land. The absence
of the body was an insuperable obstacle, and the
jury returned a verdict of not guilty of murder.
But the Cingalese man gets seven years for steal-
ing the Chinaman’s money, and as the law can no
more prove theft without the evidence of the live
Chinaman than it can prove murder without the
evidence of the dead one, it is a foolish and
tyrannous way to strike an average.

There have of late been very bad re-
ports as to the health of Queen Wifhelmina
of Holland, and if she dies the great but
old and worn-out family of Orange becomes
extinct. Then William of Germany will probably
reach out for Holland and its big colonial empire,
on the ground that it is an old-time province of
the German empire and lapses back to the empire
for want of direct heirs. And Britain, which has
taken quite a lot of Dutch territory, will be
shocked, and France will want Belgium (which
was once French territory) as compensation, and
Austria will remark that it ought to have Servia
or Macedonia to make things square, and Russia
will ask for a bit of China, and Italy will fix its
eye on Tripoli, and the fat will be in the fire all
round. And then, as likely as not, nothing will
happen.

Mr. W. G. Hearne.—Dear Sir,—l am writing to tell you
about, the wonderful cure your medicine has effected in
mv case. About three years ago I began to cough. At
first the cough was not severe, but it gradually got worse,
and I became very weak and troubled with night sweats,
uain in my chest, and great quantities of phlegm. On
several occasions there was blood in the expectorated
matter. I had been treated by a doctor, who pronounced
mv ease to be Consumption, and various other treatments
had been tried, but without benefit. It was at this stage
that I heard of your Bronchitis Cure, and sent to you for
a course of the medicine. When it arrived I was too ill to
leave my bed, but I commenced taking it at once, and
gradually improved. lam glad to say that the two lots
of medicine you sent have effected a complete cure, for
which accept my very best thanks.-Yours gratefully^

I am sure you will be glad to know that your Bronchitis
Cure has quite cured me. I was very glad when it came,
as I was suffering from a severe attack of Bronchitis at the
time it arrived. I had sent for my own doctor, but had
not had one night’s rest for a week. I started taking the
Bronchitis Cure three times a day as directed, and was
very much eased at once. At the end of a week I only
took it twice a day, and then only every night for a
week, as I was so much better when, thanks to the Lord
for adding His blessing, l was quite well, and walked into
town and back without feeling any fatigue. I had not
done that, previously for 12 months—always went in the
omnibus—as walking caused me such pain and distress in
the chest. I always walk now, and never feel it, and I
am stronger than I have been for years. I thank my son
for his great kindness in sending the medicine, and am,

The extract runs as followsAs for myself, thank
the Lord, lam feeling stronger than I have for years. I
had an attack of Bronchitis in November, but Hearnes
Bronchitis Cure was again successful. I feel quite well,
and walk into town feeling quite strong.
“ 1 must ask you to send me six bottles more of the
medicine, as I wish to have a supply in the house. 1
have tried to get it made up here, and let my chemist
have a bottle to see what he could do. He tells me this
week he can make nothing out of it, he never saw any-
thing like it before, so there is only one thing for me to
do—send for more. I have never kept in bed one day
since I commenced to take it. I used to be in bed a fort-
night at a time always, and after that for months I was
as weak as I could possibly be, and was always taking
cod liver oil, so you will see at once, it is quite worth
while sending for it such a long distance.
“ Something more I must tell you. Charlotte has been
very ill since I wrote you. Her cough was so bad she
never had a night’s rest, and was spitting up blood
very much. The doctor told her husband that there was
nothing more he could do for her. So on the Sunday I
sent her half a bottle of the Bronchitis Cure, and told
her to try it, and if she did not use it, not to waste it,
but send it back again. She had such confidence in her
doctor that I thought she would not try it. On the
Wednesday I sent over again, and she was much better,
the night’s rest was very good, and cough and bleeding
from the lungs better. She sent for another half-bottle,
and on the following Sunday sent over to say that she
was quite cured and did not require any more medicine.
So you see what great good it has done, and she wishes
to have some of my next supply.”

EXPECTORATING BLOOD AND MATTER.
COMPLETELY CURED.
“ Mr. W. G. Hearne.
“Dear Sir, —Your medicine has cured me of bronchitis
and asthma, from which I suffered for upwards of seven
years, during which period I was scarcely ever free from
coughs, and frequently the difficulty of breathing was so
distressing that for nights in succession I had to sit up.
I write you this acknowledgment from a sense of duty, as
in my case every other treatment had failed. For a year
previous I had been getting very much worse, and at the
time I obtained your medicine I was confined to bed
suffering from a most violent cough, expectorating blood
and matter, and apparently beyond hope of recovery.
The first dose of the medicine gave me welcome reltef,
and I steadily improved as I continued the treatment,
until I became, as I am now, quite well.—Yours sincerely,
H. WALKER, Balmain, Sydney."

Mr. Alex. J. Anderson, of Oak Park, Charleville,

17 years, and having been under a great many different
treatments without benefit, I was induced to fry Hearne’s
medicine for Asthma. After taking three bottles of this
medicine I quite got rid of the Asthma, and since then,
which was in the beginning of 1883— 15 years ago—l have
not had the slightest return of it. The medicine quite
cured me, and I have much pleasure in recommending it.’’
Writing again on the 4t.h April, 1899, he states: “f
am keeping very well now. Never have the slightest
return of the Asthma.”

the United Kingdom over £80,000,000 a year is

Of the making of books there is no end, and the
same might be said of the information .contained in
“ Pugh’s* Queensland Almanac and Directory for 1902.”
The almanac is a red-covered volume of 992 pp., and
there is a legend that once a man read it right
through. Having done so, he bailed up three
Queenslanders and talked over Queensland affairs,'
statistics, the high water at the principal ports, reviewed
the past year, made sympathetic remarks on the careers
of the mighty dead who had snuffed out since 1900, told
about the general elections of 1896 and 1899, and analysed
the results thereof, and reeled off “ Queensland Men of
the Time,” with full particulars of everybody in Banana-
land who has any particulars about him at all ; also
alluded casually to postal arrangements, Masonic lodges,
banking, stamp duties, the distances of the country,
particulars of the tradesmen at the smaller towns, and
all about the shire councils and divisional boards. Two
of the Bananalanders were insensible by this time, but
the oldest one asked feebly—“ Say, boss; when did yer
travel those parts ? ” “ Never, thank Heaven 1 ” the man
replied, “ but I’ve just finished reading Pugh’s almanac.”

Business, Robbery, etc.
“Te Hoheha Mata” writes: “Here is some-
thing approaching to absolute financial genius. In a town
down this way (South Queensland) a resident recently
decided to raffle bis old horse in a ridiculous number of
tickets at a respectable amount each. At first fixed date
the raffle was postponed owing to inadequate patronage.
Second attempt the same thing happened and the event
was again postponed, though under violent protest.
About this time the old horse died, broken up with dis-
appointment at not being raffled, and the proprietor
hired a passing ox-persuader to make the necessary
remarks.- Just here, however, a wise and up-to-date
friend intervened. The money wasn’t returned, but the
friend wrote to every member of the raffle stating that
the drawing had taken place under his supervision, and
that the person written to was the winner. By next post
he wrote to them all again, stating that ‘ your horse ’ had
unfortunately fallen down dead, and requesting ss.
for burial expenses. And if it hadn’t been that 82 ticket-
holders compared notes in the matter and came
round to make inquiries, the scheme might have been a
very brilliant success.”

A bank clerk in a Queensland mining town
made good perks out of a 141 b. brass weight and a file.
When Saltbush Bill brought along his gold to the bank,
out of the little lot the clerk annexed, say, 3dwt., and to
make up weight threw in brass filings. When he had
got a few ounces together he would make an entry as
having bought so many ounces from some imaginary
person and pocket the cash. When a big parcel from
that town reached the mint the brass filings were thrown
out. The blame at first went to the Chinamen from the
Nor’-West until close investigation revealed the trick.

Litigation was never at so low an ebb in Mel-
bourne as at present. The litigious spirit seems to have
forsakeri the people, and the injured man prefers turning
his other cheek. In a recent week the law courts were
almost utterly deserted—civil, criminal, insolvency,
divorce, banco, county, and practice. The excessive
costliness of legal process has, of late years, convinced the
average man that it is better to bear the ills he has than
to fly to the lawyers. The lawyers have not quite killed
the goose that laid the golden eggs, but they have at
least taught it not to be such a confounded goose. And
the trend of things in Sydney is similar. When a big
firm like (say) Dalgety’s has a dispute with (say) the
Colonial Sugar Co. they don’t go to law—they simply
appoint a third party to adjust the trouble amicably.

The “Chancery estates” game is played
assiduously in Australia, and the bait of “ count-
less millions” lying idle dangled before the foolish
for the sake of fees. A recent British Treasury return
shows that there is just £1,050,000 in Chancery, in 3200
-separate accounts, of which 19-20ths are under £lOOO in
value. Proof of claim, the Court of Chancery explains,
would in many cases probably more than absorb the
amount available. A knowledge of these facts should
save many people from wasting money foolishly.

A result of Victorian Parliament’s abolition of
the Coupon system is a theatre-ticket scheme. Several
Melbourne suburban shops now give a voucher with
each 6d. purchase, 500 of which entitle holder to
two dress circle or eight gallery seats in the theatre, or
a trip down the Bay. The new Act is said to be not
comprehensive enough to catch these fish. But, as there
is no middleman living on the game this time, it doesn’t
matter much.

There was a sustained howl in Melbourne from
the shop-keepers over Solicitor-General Wynne’s action in
remitting fines imposed upon street fruit-hawkers in local
courts. Now the police decline to take action, and the
Dagoes have pretty well their own way. The fact is most
Melbourne people depend upon these hawkers for their
fruit-supply, and the abolition of the barrow-man would
enormously reduce the present consumption of apples,
peaches, pears and grapes, and give the grower another
hard knock. Good fruit that is 4d. or 6d. per lb. in the
shops is ljd. or 2d. on the barrows. The difference means
rent mainly. The barrow-man is a nuisance in one way,
but he is extremely useful, and as the landlord is a more
intolerable nuisance, public sympathy is all with the
hawker. Hundreds of tons of good fruit are wasted
every season in Victorian orchards owing to the extor-
tions of middlemen and landlords. A relative of the
writer’s sent several cases of apples to Melb. la3t season,
and received in return two 2d. stamps. He sent the
stamps back to the writer, who bought with them lib. of
the same apples from the retailer (apples in Melbourne
are sold by the pound instead of by the dozen as in
Sydney).

“E.W.A.” gives some of his experiences with
an inventor, and wonders if he was the “Byronite”
gentleman who proposed to make a tremendous explosive
out of beetroot“ At first he had a flying-machine, pro-
bably the same that he offered to Gen. French for
£10,000,000. His idea was delightfully simple, and cheap
at the price. The power of the earth to attract bodies to
itself ceased at a distance of 45 miles from its surface;
therefore, you had only to rise into space for that distance,
wait for the earth to turn round, and then descend
by gravitation. He had got it all worked out, and merely
wanted a motor designed that would carry him up the
required distance. (In engineering, you know, the master-
mind leaves the working-out of details to others.) He
had gone into calculations, and reckoned that he could
deliver the mails to England in 37 hours, and had got a
contract signed by Dan O’Connor (then P.M.G.), by which
he was to receive some enormous subsidy when he accom-
plished this. I asked how he intended to drop
down by gravitation if he got beyond its scope.
He soon fixed up that little difficulty. All you had to do
was to take a strong magnet covered with a brass sheath,
and when you wanted to descend take the sheath off,
when the iron in the earth would attract the magnet and
incidentally the air-ship, to itself. Yet another invention
was an automobile to travel a mile and a quarter and 44
yards in a minute. He was nothing if not precise in his
calculations. He had a workshop rigged up and spent
months making the engine. The idea was simply the old
one of tremendously high gearing, a rock upon which
many an invention has split, and of course was a dead
failure. I remember the trial well, and the look on the
face of the man who financed it, when the machine
refused to budge. Another invention was a ship to
travel 70 miles an hour and only draw two inches of water,
and a perpetual-motion engine to be worked by water
from a tank above, which water the engine pumped back.”

According to an English paper (only it doesn’t
put it that way), London has made such extraordinary
progress under Freetrade, that it now does much
fine laundry work for Holland, France and Belgium, while
Germany shows an increasing tendency to have its shirt
washed in London. Britannia may in future be repre-
sented as an old lady at the washtub, and the country
which used to advance cash to almost every other place
on earth, depend for existence on taking in international
washing.

The agent curse ! A friend of writer’s casually
mentioned that he was about to purchase a steam engine.
Since then he has not rested. Agents, with the “ best
make of engine on earth,” swarmed like bees into his
private residence at all hours, and hummed like the same
insect. He was waylaid in the streets by seedy-looking
persons, who wanted a word for a moment about engines.
Went to the country, and all varieties of “ direct importers
of steam engines” hunted him around in all manner of
vehicles. He is now on a trip to the Islands, to escape
the persecution. Does all Australia live on the commis-
sion racket ?

“Pukaki”: The Maoriland dairying industry
is one of the brightest examples of the benepts of co-
operation. When the factory system was inaugurated 10
years back, all the factories were proprietary concerns,
and the farmers didn’t get a big price for their milk.
But factory after factory was bought out by the milk-

possible results for the farmers. They now get well-paid

cockatoos generally are, they seem to be able to run a

The struggle for a crust! A variant of an old
dodge was exposed, in Melb. City Court, lately. A young
man went round selling “ Honolulu Lily ” seeds, guaran-
teed to sprout in a glass of water, with a handful of salt
therein, and to exhale a delicious odor, also to keep a
house free from flies. The seeds were those of common
buckwheat.

Re civil servants and money-lending : The worst
shark money-lenders are Govt, servants, who generally
lend money to under-men on terms that might bring a
blush of shame to the face of a Rand syndicate.. Suppos-
ing the lender lets out 10s., he gets an 100 from his
victim for £1 due at the Ist of the month, but if the bor-
rower fails to pay at the time stated, he has to pay 30s.
the following month. One genius who lends small sums
to very junior clerks is reputed to make the borrower
always forge his father’s name to the I O U. He is always ,
paid.

A thriving little local industry was started in a
Q. town the other day without any tariff stimulus. The
citizens were energetically canvassed on behalf of a new
patent American varnish, which was the best thing in the '
world for buggies, bicycles, oil-paintings, grates, and :
many other things, and they bought freely at a good
price. It was found subsequently that the tins were
made locally and filled with a mixture of turps, oils, and ,
vinegar ; but by that time the industry had moved on to '
another town.

The latest M.L. scheme is an endowment fire-

“H.P.”: Finding that my grocer was still
charging the old N.S.W. duty-paid rates on tea, I asked
him had he not made a mistake. “Oh ! no,” he replied,
“ the duty did not go on." He thought I meant that
he was charging too little ! Evidently, had the Federal
Govt, passed the old Vic. State tea-duty (3d. a lb.) he
would have raised his tea accordingly. Disgusted with
such dodgery, I interviewed another grocer. He, too,
quoted the old prices, but when I pointed out that the
duty was now removed, he admitted that he kept his
price tip “unless the customer spoke about the abolition
of the duty.” Then he reduced it. Moral: read the
newspapers, advertisements included.
Dear Bulletin. —The reference to “ the
reunion of the Ballarat and Bendigo printers with
their metropolitan conferes ” in Bulletin of the
19th April was somewhat “ off its feet ” as regards
the facts. The “exes” were not, as unkindly
alleged, “ provided by means of a circular inviting
subscriptions,” but by the entertaining comps,
themselves, each of whom planked down at least
“ half-a-sov.,” like a “toff.” Truly, some of the
prizes for races were gifts, but in this respect even
the “bakers, butchers, and grocers” enjoy a
“shout.” Now, who’s the angry Scotchman? —
J. W. Tucker, Carlton, Melb., 21/4/’O2.
More evidence from an Auckland (M.L.)
paper of the ignorance of the Boers, who, it is
suggested, should be given no quarter, and
butchered like wild beasts by savages :
Trooper Alfred B. Morton, of the Sixth Contingent,
writes to his parents :—“Rolfontein, February 9, 1902.
We are still here, near Spitz Kop, awaiting to attack
Botha, who is a few miles distant, so we hear. This
morning I called at a farm-house and saw the ruins of a
splendid observatory, the telescope of which must have
cost nearly £lOOO. It was mounted on a huge iron
pedestal 13ft. high, and telescope barrel was lift, long,
and 9in. diameter— i.e., one length of it. The house had
a circular revolving roof. Everything was smashed as
much as possible. I could not find the lens.”
The Lower House of Par ia ient in Den-
mark has one representative to every 16,000
people, in Norway one to every 19,500, Switzer-
land one to 20,000, Sweden one to 22,000,
Canada one to 22,688, Hungary one to 38,000,
Belgium one to 42,000, Spain and Austria one to
42,000, Australia one to 50,000, Britain one to
57,000. As regards their State Parliaments, even
N.S.W., with 125 M’s.L.A. (one to every 11,000
people), hasn’t such a pressure as Prince Edward
Island (one to 4000), or New Brunswick (one to
8000). Certainly some of the Australian State
Assemblies could bear cutting down, but it is
far more important to get rid of the foolish
and useless Leg. Councils where the dead men lie
—and how some of them do lie /
The latest American horror from the
Philippines is to the effect that Uncle Sam’s
soldiers have dropped into the habit of torturing
the natives by pumping water slowly on their
heads —a process which even the Inquisition
never improved on much—to extract confessions.
Doubtless they obtained a lot of confessions —999
people out of 1000 would tell everything they
knew and anything they could invent as well
before they had been pumped on many minutes.
It would be interesting to know if the Southern
States practice of burning colored men alive with
kerosene has also been carried to the islands. By
the way, the name of that pleasing person,
General Jacob Smith, turns up in connection with
this latest atrocity also. Jacob appears to be an
interesting remanet from the dark ages.

All fagged out— Scarcely enough - energy to get home in the
evening—No rest after you do get home —As tired in the morning
as you are at night—•
Back so lame that you can scarcely bend it—Aches and
throbs and pains even when you lie still—•
Kidneys are to blame.
They’re not taking the poison out of the blood—Need help,
and need it at once.
Other Sydney people have been in the same Condition-
Hundreds of them —They’ve taken
DOAN’S BACKACHE KIDNEY PILLS.
And they’ve been cured —
Cured so quickly and permanently that they could scarcely
believe their own senses—
They’ll tell you about the goodness of Doan’s Backache
Kidney Pills—tell you with a glad earnestness that you can’t
help believing—
Read what one Sydney man has to say:
Mr. P. Smith, No. 1 Cheltenham-street, Balmain, says : “ Over twelve months ago I
used Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills for kidney troubles, and they worked a miracle in my
case. I had been under three doctors at different times, but their treatment did me no
good. I used to be so bad that I would have to be Carried home in a cart if an attack
came on when working or in the street. Sometimes when working I have been taken
bad, and would be taken to the hospital. My wife said she never expected I would live :
through some of these bad turns. I suffered with a kind of biliousness, vomiting egg-like
stuff. My secretions were in a frightful state. I Could never bend my back or move at
all when I had a bad turn. The people at the hospital gave me medicines and recom-
mended rubbing in liniments, but it was no use, they did me no good. I saw an adver-
tisement for Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills, stating that these Pills had cured Mr. Dunn,
and, knowing him, led me to procure this remedy. I only took one box of Doan’s
Backache Kidney Pills, and they cured me. The first dose relieved me. When I had
finished them I started work, and have worked ever since. It is heavy work lam doing,
but it does not affect me. These pills cured me after years of suffering, and the relief
was almost instantaneous. I might state that since then I have had a bad attack of
lumbago, which laid me up one month. I tried several, but never thought Doan’s
Backache Kidney Pills were good for this complaint. Then I remembered that I had a
few in a box, and, not having any other medicine in the house, I tried them. They cured
me. I procured these marvellous pills at Newman’s Pharmacy, in King-street.”
You can buy Doan’s Pills of all Chemists and Storekeepers,
at 2s. 9d. per box (six boxes 15s. 3d.), or they will be posted on

A Martyr to Itching Piles.
FOR OVER TWENTY YEARS, AND
PERMANENTLY CURED BY TWO
POTS OF DOAN’S OINTMENT.
Mr. M. J. Rvan, J.P., 398 Riley-street, a well-
known resident of Sydney, and all over this State,
writes the following unsolicited letter for the
benefit of suffering humanity. He says:—“lt
gives me great pleasure to testify to the great
worth of Doan’s Ointment. I have been a martyr
for over 20 years to the dreadful disease of itching.
Piles, which very often nearly drove me mad. I
may tell you that during all those years I have
never had one good night’s rest. I tried scores of
doctors, both in Sydney and the country. I have
tried lotions and ointments, and I might as well
have used water for all the good they did me. I
am sending you this testimonial so that you may
use it in the interest of my fellow creatures, as I
am sure there ar** hundreds of them suffering the
same as I did Now, I may state that two
months ago, I heard a gentleman telling another
of his terrible sufferings, and how he got cured by
Doan’s Ointment. lat once purchased a pot, and
I am proud to say that from that very night I
have slept sound, and without being tortured, for
the first time in 20 years. I continued the treat-
ment, and before I had used two boxes, I found
myself entirely cured. This is two months ago,
and I have had no return of my complaint since.
I would willingly have paid £5O to any doctor, if
he had guaranteed to do what Doan’s Ointment
did for me. You may publish this statement in
The Bulletin or any other paper, and should
anyone wish to call on me or write, I will be
pleased to tell them of my cure in detail.—l am,
dear sirs, yours very truly,
M. J. RYAN, J.P.,
July 27, 1901. 398 Riley-street.
To Foster, McClellan Co.,
76 Ritt-street, Sydney.
It cannot be repeated too often that Doan’s
Ointment will cure itching Piles. IT WILL
CURE THEM ABSOLUTELY. But do not
take the manufacturers’ word for this, ask Mr.
Ryan; he knows, for it cured him, and he lives
here in Sydney. Is not that the best possible
kind of proof ? Could there be better ?
Doan’s Ointment is splendid in all Skin
Diseases, Eczema, Sores, Hives, Insect Bites,
Chilblains, &c. It is perfectly safe and very effec-
tive. For sale by all chemists and storekeepers
at 2s. 9d. per pot, or will be posted on receipt of
the price by Foster, McClellan Co., 76 Pitt-street,

Be sure it is DOAN’S.
The Jingo Press in Prayer.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“ War is the game of the newspapers.”
—’Murkan aphorism.
“The Public, Lord, are weary now of scandal
and divorce ;
They tire of retail murder, and of swindles on the
Bourse ;
So now, we pray Thee, hearken how they clamor
wild for Gore,
And vouchsafe Thy faithful Pressmen just a
passing breeze of war.
“ Our circulation’s falling—yea, Thou knowest it
is so ;
The ads. are waning daily, and our profits dwindle
low ;
But the public purse will open, and the public
purse will pour
In a rain of endless coppers if the papers give it
gore !
“The scent of battle-powder—O, the People love
it well;
They love to read of slaughter and the shriek of
shot and shell;
The Brute is strong within them, and the Brute
will always pay
If it sniff the bloody banquet where the wolves of
battle prey.
“So send the sound of bugles and the peal of
battle-drum,
Let thousand clarions clamour and let Mercy’s
voice be dumb;
What matters woman’s weeping when her home-
less children die,
So Thy loving Journals flourish and Thy loving
Journals lie.
“Thou knowest, Lord and Master, in Thy realm
of Land and Sea,
What a lever for Thy potency Thy loving Pressmen
be ;
Thou knowest, Lord, to prosper, we must go the
ways of Guile—
For the breath within our nostrils is the lucre of
the Vile;
“And the Yile are always with us—and they
curse the Good and Pure,
And Thy Press must curse in chorus if Thy Press
would fain endure,
And the Vile assault us daily with a lustful lion’s
roar,
‘Give us blood to stay our craving—Give us
Rapine—Give us War ! ’
“ The Days of Peace fatigue us with their endless
tales of Lust,
Their Greed that rules the Market Place and
grinds the Poor to Dust;
These fatted Peaceful Robbers —we are weary of
them too,
For a change give Open Rapine with her thrice-
accursed crew.”
So they prayed a rain of blesssing, and the rain it
came in flood —
For the gentle Journals’ healing came a pouring
rain of blood,
And the Lucre that was coveted —it came without
surcease,
And on weary Press and Pressmen fell the dews
' of Fatted Peace.
PHILLANDER FLAM.
Our New Selection.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
SADDLETOP was going ahead. A new
church and an old public-house went up—
the public-house that used to be at the Gap.
A camp of men came along with a tent and some
tools, and dug a Government dam; some more
cleared the lanes of timber and trees—felled them
and chopped them up and left them stacked in
heaps that blocked the road and frightened horses
and made them bolt.
A lot of new selectors came and brought large
families with them, and murmured like the
Israelites because the school was six miles from
them.
Dad became their Moses. He couldn’t see that
they had anything to grumble about, but Dad
always listened to people who had a grievance.
He went to work and agitated earnestly for anew
school at our end of the district. Dad worked
night and day to get them that school, and when
at last it was granted and the building went up,
they murmured more because it was erected
within a few feet of Dad’s land.
* * * *
One day a young man, overwhelmed with a
collar—a lean stripling of a man, with no more
hip than a goanna, a clean face, a “ haw ” in his
voice, a cane in his hand, and a gorgeous band on
his straw hat—mounted the verandah and an-
nounced himself to Dad as the teacher to the new
school.
Dad scarcely heard him. He was confused.
He stared and couldn’t think of anything to say.
Had the angel Gabriel, or the hangman,
suddenly appeared before him, Dad’s equa-
nimity couldn’t have been more disturbed.
Dad was never himself in the presence of leading
people; and the prig-pedagogue and the sage
were one and the same to him.
The teacher bowed and said he believed Dad
was Mr. Rudd. His own name was Wood-Smith
—Mr. Philip Wood-Smith—and he handed Dad a
card, and, sitting in an easy-ehair, began to talk
of schools and curriculum in an earnest and
learned manner. He believed in teaching a boy
mathematics and mentioned Napoleon Bonaparte
and others whom Dad hadn’t heard of; but con-
demned classics and the dead languages.
“What is the use of them,” he said; “what
earthly use is Greek to you now on this farm, Mr.
Rudd ? ” (Dad looked along the verandah-boards).
“Can you say you have ever found your Latin or
your ethical problems in Shakspeare of any use to
you since you left school?”
Dad, in tones of uneasiness, said he hadn’t.
“ And yet ■”
Mother found her way to the verandah, and
Dad told the teacher she was Mrs. Rudd. They
shook hands, and when Mr. Wood-Smith looked
round to address Dad again he was gone.
The new teacher was a polite man, and enjoyed
society. Never before was there anyone like him
at Saddletop. Whenever he met Miss Wilkins or
Grey’s daughters or Sarah he would smile and
take off his hat and strike his knees with it. And
it didn’t matter how far off they were—whether
on a verandah a mile away or on horseback or
carrying in sticks—he smiled and took his hat off
just the same.
• * • *
Dave regarded Mr. Wood-Smith with disfavor.
The polish of him and his attention to girls
annoyed Dave.
“ He’s a goat! no matter how much he knows,”
Dave said in the kitchen one day.
Sarah stood up for the ways of the pedagogue.
She thought it proper such respect should be
shown her sex.
“Then you’re mighty fond o’ bein noticed,”
Dave answered, cynically.
Young Tom was sitting at the table, having
late dinner, alone. He joined in.
“ Not when they’re m-milkiri, Dave, an’ haven’t
their stockin’s on ” (Dave looked at him and
grinned), “or’na tub o’ water.”
Tom struggled on the floor from a poke mother
gave him with the tea-pot.”
“But it wouldn’t hurt you,” Sarah went on,
quietly, “ to lift your hat.”
“No, it wouldn’t ,” Dave snarled; “an’ it
wouldn’t hurt anyone if I didn’t, an’ who wants
t’ wear a hat out swingin’ it about as if lie wanted
t’block a cow?” Arid Dave chuckled trium-
phantly, and went out.
Mr. Wood-Smith was a frequent visitor at our
place, and if he chanced to remain for a meal any-
time, Dad would become agitated. He would lose
his head, and at the table make all kinds of
mistakes. When he didn’t pass meat to someone
who didn’t want any, he dropped a plate and spilt
gravy about or mutilated his fingers with the
carver.
But Dad usually contrived to avoid Wood-
Smith’s society. Dad had never received a great
education himself, and the presence of so much
learning annoyed him. But always when the
teacher had left Dad talked favorably of him.
Once mother asked how much salary he thought
Mr. Wood-Smith received, and Dad reckoned he
would get at least a thousand.
* * • *
Politeness was the broad plank in Wood-Smith’s
curriculum, and he hammered it hard into his
pupils.
One day Dad was riding on the road and met
the scholars returning home. Several raised their
hats to him. Dad stared and went on. Some
more hats. Dad scowled. Then Tom limped
along, swinging a lizard by the tail.
“ Hello, Dad”—and up went his hat.
Dad turned the mare sharply and went after
him.
“Yer young devil!” —he shouted, striking at
Tom round the base of a tree with a riding-switch
—“ would y’ make sport o’ me, too ?”
“ ’E tol’ us t’ —” Tom whined.
“’Oo?”
“S-S -Smith:’
“ T’ mek fun o’ me ? ”
“ No—t’ ”
Dad attempted to dismount and Tom dropped
the lizard and escaped.
* • * •
Boxing Night. A party at our place—Sarah’s
party. Such a gathering 1 Every soul on Saddle-
top must have been present —everyone except the
Careys. And the display of lights and lanterns
would blind you. The verandahs right round
were hung thick with them. Two accordeon-
players and a violinist were in attendance, and to
hear the music they made when you reached the
gate would make your heart jump.
Sarah flew about everywhere; met her female
friends at the steps and hugged them, and escorted
them in and took their hats and things and found
sleeping-places for the babies.
Joe looked after the men for her—warned them
of the dog and the barb-wire; showed them where
to put their horses, and conducted them to the
ballroom and introduced them to any young ladies
they didn’t know.
Dancing about to commence :
Mr. Wood-Smith arrived. He came late, and
McGregor, a very old mate of Dad's, strolled in
about the same time. Dad hurried forward and
seized McGregor by the hand and welcomed him
boisterously. Dad hadn’t seen McGregor for a
number of years and the pair sat together at a
table and talked of old times.
They talked for hours.
Intermission. The room containing Dad and
McGregor became crowded, and cake and coffee
were being handed round.
A lull in the clatter of tongues. McGregor
turned to Mr. Wood-Smith, who sat near him
sipping coffee, and in a loud sonorous tone said :
“’N’ hoo’s th’ auld mon—quite weel, Phil?”
Dad stared and nudged McGregor. He thought
his old mate was making a mistake.
But Wood-Smith understood. He blushed and
fidgetted, then forced a smile and answered:
“ He’s ah—pretty well, indeed.”
“ An’ auld Mick ?”
Mr. Wood-Smith fidgetted more. He wished
someone would come to the door and call him.
The company appeared interested.
“Pretty well, I think,” he said, eyeing the
door.
McGregor turned to Dad.
“Y’ken,” McGregor said, “auld Micky, wvn
cleanit the dustboxes i’ Dreeyton—uncle to tlm
mon ? ” And he pointed his thumb at the teacher.
Dad drew himself up like a cockatoo, roused.
“ Not his uncle ! ” he explained, his eyes opening
like a door.
“Yes, mon”—and McGregor laughed at Dad’s
astonished look—“ Yes, Phil’s a son o’ auld Jem
Smith, o’ Quartpot, is he nae ? An’ wus nae auld
Micky a brither o’ Jem’s ? ”
The discovery was too much for Dad. He stood
up and stared at Wood-Smith.
“ Dammit! ” he said, “ I know y’.”
“Y’ couldna f’get auld Jemmy?” McGregor
said.
“Remember him well,” Dad answered, his eyes
shining with enthusiasm. And turning to the
company, who, to the discomfort of the teacher,
were all grinning, said, with a ring of pride in
his voice: “ His father an’me knew one another
thirty years ago.”
‘ ‘ Eh! an’ th’ auld woman tae —, ” said McGregor.
“ An’ his mother ,” Dad added.
“An’ y’ min’ th’ bunnicks she used tae male
us a’ ? ”
Dad burst into a loud laugh at mention of the
“bunnicks.” But Wood-Smith didn’t. He only
smiled, but his face was very red.
“An’min’, too, th’auld black hen she used to
lia’ settin’ wi’ eggs in th’ bed ? ”
Dad held his sides, and the tears ran down
his furrowed cheeks.
“ An’ th’ p-p-p-” (McGregor couldn’t speak for
laughing) “th’ pig i’ th’ hoose wi’ ” (choked again)
“ wi’ rihbon tied tae it.”
Dad gave a tremendous roar ; the whole house
exploded, and it was minutes before Joe’s voice
could be heard yelling—
“S’lect your partners for a waltz.”
