The Red Page
We Also Serve...
It cannot be denied that the poets and
writers of thd Commonwealth have, in the
present world catastrophe, a necessary and
highly important function to serve. While
the patriotic manhood of the continent is
steadily enlisting and going to the Front in
thousands, upon us, who stay at home, there
has devolved the duty of stimulating that
patriotism by our little patriotic verses and
our exhortations in as patriotic prose. A
few of us have, doubtless, given way to an
inexplicable conviction that their presence
is necessary at the Front if the Empire is
to be saved from extinction; but happily,
the great majority of us who write have
remembered in time that the pen is mightier
than the sword —even against the Kaiser’s
millions.
While we agree, in general terms, that
Australia must send every possible soldier
to reinforce the armies of the Allies, there
are cogent reasons why the bards, the
critics, the freelancers and the writers of
topical verse and patriotic songs should
sturdily stick to their job at home. In this
terrible crisis it is encouraging to find that
the majority of our poets have kept their
heads. Obviously it is better to keep our
heads than to run the risk of having them
blown off by shrapnel; but it would be a
grave reflection upon the patriotism of you
and me to infer that that considera-
tion had the least weight with us. There are
many reasons why the other bloke should
enlist. He is only a clerk, whose place can
be taken by any other clerk; only the owner
of an out-back station, that any other person
could manage as well; only a laborer, whose
pay-sheet can be as easily filled in to another
name; only a doctor or a nurse, whose work
can be just as efficiently carried on by some
other doctor or nurse; only a politician, or
navvy, or bank-manager, or farm-hand, or
lawyer, whose death would make little dif-
ference to this favored and peaceful com-
munity.
With us, who write verses, and stay at
home, there are, of course, a thousand valid
reasons for our apparent lack of patriotism.
It is not cowardice nor disloyalty. No body
of citizens has shown themselves more
patriotic or brave—in their verse's. And
many of them have recognised their duty to
their country in this awful hour of their
country’s need by deliberately, and at much
personal sacrifice of their valuable time,
joining a rifle club. In this loyal act they
have shown heroism equal to that of the
business men comprising the Millions Club.
No business appointment can keep this brave
body of Sydney citizens from giving patri-
otic luncheons to themselves, at which
speeches of the most fervent loyalty are
almost a commonplace. Nay, the sound of
the Millions Club cheering themselves can
be heard by all the other diners at their
palatial eating-house. And they have been
foremost, too, in collecting subscriptions
from their fellow-citizens, even though those
fellow-citizens cannot afford to lunch in the
same building.
So the poets and writers of this continent,
including, let us hope, you and me, have
joined their rifle club, and devote one even-
ing a week 'to defending Australia from
assault. So strong is their patriotism that
there is even talk of one rifle club putting
themselves, at their own expense, into uni-
form. This ip not only a sacrifice in the
cause of the conquered and starving Bel-
gians, but a sacrifice of their own respect.
For in these days a uniform —any uniform
—is honored ; and the member of a rifle club
must have a considerable sense of patriotism
before he goes forth in his rifle-club uniform.
He might be actually mistaken for a non-
literary private who is eagerly waiting for
his transport to sail. Prosperous, but patri-
otic citizens, passing him in the street on
his way to his parade, may say unctuously to
themselves: “Ha! Another of our brave,
devoted fellows, food for powder, bless him!”
Yet this contingency the rifle-clubman is
ready, nay, eager, to meet.
&
No; you and I cannot be accounted want-
ing in a proper sense of our responsibility
in this grave crisis. “They also serve who
only stand and wait.” We cannot be
spared; our duties are too responsible.
Doubtless our wives and children could
spare us—at least, other wives and children
are doing it every day; but it is inconceiv-
able that our country could spare us. In-
conceivable —to us. We serve in the noble
army of literature, and our place is with
the staff, not at the Front. Being poets and
writers, no doubt our actual participation
in the war of the trenches would vivify and
stimulate bur art, as no peaceful staying at
home could do it. No doubt we should
return from the war finer men and there-
fore finer poets. And what subjects for
poetry we might find on the battlefield!
We should, haply, lose some of our literary
affectations by our presence in the firing
lines of death; and our life and death part-
nership with mere unpoetic blokes might
rub some of the pardonable conceit out of
us; but these are considerations to which
we wisely pay no heed. Our sacred task is
here —to spur the other fellow to enlist.
We do not write long letters to the press
exhorting the other, or mere, bloke to fight
for his country and us ; for editors do not
pay space rates for correspondence. Our
function is more artistic. We write the
poems of the war, the exhortations, in neat
verse, to the young manhood of this con-
tinent to wake and rise up and smite the
Kaiser; we write the satirical verses for the
benefit of the other bloke who won’t enlist;
we call the Kaiser and the German names
in scathing metre, and we celebrate the vic-
tories of the other bloke in noble measures.
And if we were not here —all of us —to do
it, who would? And if we were all killed,
what would become of Australian Literature,
what, indeed, would become of this priceless
page? No, hard though it be to refrain, it
is to the everlasting honor of our noble
craft that we refuse to take our places in
the ranks. And if we are paid for our
patriotic verse, let us console ourselves with
the reflection that there can never be ad-
equate remuneration for any piece of real
literature.
&
When the war is over further sacrifices
will be demanded of us. And we shall, one
does not hesitate to say, face them bravely.
For in those days the young man who has
to explain why he didn’t go to the war will
have a rather unhappy existence, and not
to wear a scar will almost be a disgrace.
The women of our race are quick to stigma-
tise as cowardice what may be, after all,
only a devotion to literature and it may be
the fate of you and me to be despised by
the whole womanhood of Australia. But
considerations like these will, one feels sure,
carry no weight with us true poets.
Remember the saying which we may par-
donably adapt: “I care not who fights the
battles of my country, so long as I can
make its songs.” That is the proper atti-
tude, even if we poets may have to learn
German in order to write our country’s
songs.
Business as usual.
The Red Laugh
“ ‘Are you afraid?’ I repeated kindly. His
lips twitched, trying to frame a word, and
the same instant there happened something
incomprehensible, monstrous and super-
natural. I felt a draught of warm air upon
my right cheek that made me sway—that
is all —while before my eyes,, in place of the
white face, there was something short, blunt
and red, and out of it the blood was gushing
as out of an uncorked bottle. And that
short red and flowing ‘something’ still
seemed to be smiling a sort of smile, a tooth-
less laugh—a red laugh.”
This incident of a shell decapitating an
officer on the battlefield, so brutally
described, gives the title and the realistic
method of Leonidas Andreief’s The Red
Laugh (Unwin,' Is.). In Russia Andreief’s
popularity almost transcends that of Gorki;
he, too, has “invented a new thrill.” And
though in The Red Laugh the background is
the Manchurian war, the work is horribly
applicable to the present trouble. Its first
words, “Horror and madness” form the key
to these “fragments of a discovered manu-
The book is a ghastly record of
mutilations, but its treatment is profoundly
psychological, and the mutilations of the
bodies of the soldiers are overshadowed by
the mutilations of their minds. Modern
war is not meant for modern nerves, and
this Russian author stresses one side of
modern war to which there has been already
a number of guarded references from the
front—the mention of combatants whose
brains have been unable to stand the strain
of the modern battle-front. There is one
terrible pictures of the mad soldiers who
wander about the battlefields. “Sometimes
they are fired at by mistake, sometimes on
purpose, for they make you lose all patience
with their unintelligible, terrifying cries.”
Andreief sees war as the act of madmen.
This is the realisation that this war will
bring to the world —but first it is necessary
to exterminate the insane brood of Huns
that thought to smash civilisation with
shrapnel.

“Kunasarta”: “Having noticed with inter-
est the ‘Dawn-morn’ rime controversy, the
writer, after some years of careful study
of Austral-English, ventures to rush in with
an opinion. As English is spoken by nine
out of ten Australians dawn and morn rime
perfectly. The Australian shortens the r
sound in the latter word, so that a listener
might easily conclude that is was spelled
mawn. Ido not criticise this pronunciation,
only cite it as a tendency on the part of
Australians towards elision of vowel sounds
and shortening consonants. There should
be, as a matter of fact, a great distinction
between morn and mourn; but listen care-
fully to very well educated Australians and
you scarcely find one in twelve who con-
siders the value of vowel sounds, or who
gives the slightest roll on the r, a letter
■which loses its value phonetically unless it
be slightly rolled or prolonged. Having
taught English for several years on both
lent, the writer has noticed
les mentioned are wide-
s well as pupils using what
Austral-English. The ear
ied to this pronunciation,

Fires of Spring and How to
Light Them
This is Lesson II of the Kindergarten
Class for Lady Novelists. The first was
“Purple Mists and How to Write Them”
(R.P. 23/4/T4).
Ladies, now we come to the Seductive
Novel, the Near-the-Knuckle Novel, the
Society Novel of Sex, the Novel of the Fox-
Hunting Rich. It is guaranteed highly re-
munerative, and it is dead easy. That is
why we are discussing it to-day. The text
for to-day’s lesson is The Fire of Spring,
by Ethel Boileau (Nash). The ingredients
of this highly seasoned dish are easily pro-
cured.
(1) An alluring title, suggesting passion-
ate possibilities.
(2) A moated grange in a fox-hunting
county.
(3) A heroine unhappily married.
(4) A perfect rotter of a husband for No.
3.
(5) A society adventuress, necessary for
the disposal of No. 4.
(6) A big man, extremely male.
(7) A locked bedroom door.
(8) The adultery of the ill-used wife and
the big male. (Be careful, however, not to
call it adultery. The adultery is what the
rotter of a husband commits with the ad-
venturess. It’s just the sort of rotten thing
you’d expect him to do. But No. 8 is quite
a different sort of thing. It’s a grande
passion or something equally French, and
you’re merely dreadfully sorry for them
both.)
(9) The enchanted garden—usually situ-
ated in Africa, with the usual furnishings—
the sensuous perfumes of the East, the
weird melancholy of its music, the hot hush
of the desert, etc. (Here you go one better
than Robert Hichens.)
(10) More adultery in the garden of
dreams.
(11) The world calls the man. All Eng-
land is waiting to be saved, 'or regenerated,
or something, and the big male is the only
person for the job. So he go'es.
(12) They say farewell. (Linger over
this, and see that the background is sen-
suously romantic.)
(13) Kill him.
(14) Better stop. Leave it at that. Any-
how, you’ve filled 350 pages.
d*
The title need not trouble you much. This
novel was originally titled The Garden of
Dreams —sufficiently suggestive of Robert
Hichens, but the author found that some-
body else had already usurped that title. What
more natural, then, than to label her product
The Fire of Spring? It suggests the
awakening of love, the surge of passion.
Ethel makes her meaning clearer by putting
opposite the title-page: “In the life of
every man and woman there lies hidden an
enchanted garden.” Doesn’t that touch a
chord in your own heart? Haven’t you felt
just that, yourself? Read on, and you come
to the dedication: “To le pays du tendre.”
How romantic that sounds! Now you are in
the right mood to condone adultery.
Of course Angela only thought herself in
love with Tony, the rotter she married. She
was obviously attracted: she thought him
“a splendid devil.” For Angela—you must
always be careful about this—is no bread-
and-butter miss. Her mouth was “ador-
able; provoking, mocking, with the true
curve of passion.” She was a “ grande
amoureuse with a soul —there are a few
such, and even in the abandonment of pas-
sion she was elusive, unconquerable”....
“Angela had always been one of those in-
describably sensuous-looking women who
are born to set men’s blood on fire.” But,
mind you, she wasn’t common or obvious.
That must be left for her rival, the notorious
Mrs. Carton,. with whom her husband Tony
comes to grief. And then when Angela
knows that her love for her husband is dead
she meets the other bloke. .
Here, ladies, is where you have your
chance. Don’t worry about drawing any
real character; just project, from the
chaste recesses of your feminine brains,
the sort of male that you would like to love
you. You can let yourselves go—it is
quite safe in print. When you meet him,
you will become “suddenly conscious of a
peculiar strength and vitality in his gaze,”
and when he speaks to you you will notice
that his voice has “an intensely male ele-
ment.” His eyes, too, are “the eyes of mys-
tery and longing, of an impenetrable sadness
and reserve”; but his mouth and chin are
“firm, determined, vigorous.” Stress the
maleness of the man—and, after all, why
shouldn’t a man be male? Of course, his
clothes are “perfect, everything exactly as it
ought to be, and not the least suspicion of
exaggeration anywhere.” He is always “per-
fectly turned out” and he always “dominates
his clothes.” And when he hunts —of course,
he hunts —he is “splendidly mounted, on a
fine blood bay, standing 16 hands, with
powerful quarters and a tremendous fore-
hand —but a rolling, vicious eye.” And what
more natural for him to remark that he likes
something to manage, and that he wouldn’t
give anything for a horse that hadn’t a touch
of the devil—or a woman either? And when
he comes close to Angela it is inevitable that
“a curious electric current seems to pass
from him to her.”
J*
Of course, they fall in love with each
other —that is what they are there for. He
doesn’t beat about the bush: one of his
first remarks to Angela is, “What others have,
I want,” and “his voice became dangerously
attractive... .and the devil in his eyes
caught and chained the one in hers.” And
ultimately, inevitably, “she saw his nostrils
quiver.” So what more natural than that
Angela should stretch her arm out to him
impulsively, while she told him how fine it all
was, and how she believed in him, or that he
should take her hand, and another wave of
electricity should go up it right to Angela’s
heart? It is true that he knew she was
married, and that he had been engaged to
defend her husband in a divorce case. How-
ever, when men are male they don’t allow
a trifling fact like that to stand in their way.
And this is how he talks to her:—
I want to stand and watch you sleeping
with your, hair about you, and your Kk
buried in the pillow like a tired child. I
want to watch the shade of your long black
lashes upon your cheek-until in your sleep
you feei my eyes upon you—and you move
a little and sigh and half-turn towards me
and stretch your arms, throwing tne clothes
from you and then I shall see the line of
your throat and the whiteness of your body*
beneath a cloud of lace.” Beautiful and
tender and poetic, isn’t it? You can go on
like that tor pages—until he does.
But the divorce case falls through, and
your heros public career would be blighted
by any scandal. He is an immensely im-
portant man, of course. True, he might go
to Canada with her ; but she reminds him of
his dreams a united Empire, a regener-
ated England. You must finish your work
here; they are counting on you.” So you
see, an open scandal would have fatal conse-
quences for the Empire. But there remains
Tangier for a month of happiness in a hidden
garden. Here a careful study of Robert
Hichens becomes necessary. The male rents
a villa ; and you can splurge to your innocent
heart’s content over the furnishings. Angela’s
room had a floor of pink marble, covered
with deep-colored Persian rugs, the bed a
low, broad divan. And leading out of the
bedroom was a bathroom, also of pink marble,
the bath sunk in the floor and full of clear’
green water. And the background is the sen-
suous east. What more can any maiden’s
heart desire?
But remember always, ladies, your charac-
ters must be aristocratic. Scatter lords and
ladies with a lavish hand ; and you can easily
fill a chapter with a description of a hunt.
On the tables “everything was of cut glass—
except the knives and forks—rare Georgian
glass such as one does not often see.” Almost
Oorellian is that touch about the knives and
forks; it saves your reader from imagining
that they too might be of cut glass, which
would obviously show that you were not
familiar with the furnishings of the best
houses. That would be fatal to your circula-
tion.
&
Well, ladies, you may perhaps ask what
good such a book is ? What relation, if any,
has it to real life, and why should it be
necessary to write it at all? My answer is:
This is a commodity that is in great demand
by the readers of your sex who frequent sub-
scription libraries, and there are good busi-
ness men—not excessively male, perhaps—
who are always willing to supply a public
demand by putting on the market as many
Fires of Spring as you like to supply them
with. My advice to you is to delve into the
maidenly recesses of your innocent hearts,
and get busy.

“How ‘Bellerive’ would have gloried in
those crabs!” this page remarked after
quoting a peculiarly “Bellerivean” poem by
Thomas Hardy. And promptly “Bellerive”
glories, “with all do respect and honor to
Mr. Hardy.”
A male body was dragged
From a river deep,
That swollen and blue—
My blood did creep,
Borne to the morgue—
Without pomp nor grace,
With cruel crabs clinging
To the dead man’s face,
Hardy and I are the
Two boys for drabs,
But tis a joke to me
To rhyme on crabs.
With the sudden enthusiasm for the foun-
dation of rifle-clubs throughout Australia
there should be a big demand for Ernest H.
Robinson’s admirable and non-technical Rifle
Training for War (Cassell; Is.). It gives
invaluable hints, not to be found in the ser-
vice manuals.
George Hooligan sorrows with “Bill Bow-
yang” (“Red Page,” 11/3/’ls), for he, too,
has been stung:—-
Some months ago I was fool enough to send a good
meaty article to a London agency. There were no
reading fees, they simply charged 6s. for submitting
to five papers, and were to deduct 20 per cent, of the
payments. In due time the article came back with-
out the five bob, and with the names of five papers,
which it had been alleged it was submitted to. There
were three of the five which in my densest ignorance
I would not have dreamt of submitting the article to,
for it was totally unsuited to them. Just the same
way that an “Abo.” par. would be rejected by S. M.
Herald. I did not despair, but seat another article
with another ss. A stereotyped reply was duly
received, saying that the article would require to be
recast, which would entail an expenditure of 10s.
I reasoned out that if the article were accepted it
would be worth about £1 Is. After I paid ss. for
submission, 10s. for recasting, and then 20 per cent,
of the balance, there would not be much left for
stamps. Hence they have still got my article and
65., and I am not likely to see either.

A WORLD’S RECORD TARGET.
Composite target (reduced 3/16 of an inch) of
200 shots fired by G. W. Chesley in ten different
matches of the U. S. Inter-Club series. Score 1990
out of 2000—A World’s Record. Made with Win-
chester .22 Long Rifle “Lesmok” cartridges and
a Winchester Musket.
If you go in for target shooting or hunt with a .22
caliber rifle, of course you want to excel. To do so
you must use uniform, dependable ammunition.
Some makes of cartridges are as variable as the
weather. Some shots go high, some go low, and some don’t go at
all. For accuracy and all around satisfaction, you can bank on
WINCHESTER
.22 Caliber Cartridges
In all kinds of shooting they continue to excel. They are made by people who
have learned in making firearms many fine points about cartridges that could be
learned in no other way. No matter what the make or style of your favorite arm is,
you can bring out its possibilities to the fullest degree by using Winchester make
of cartridges. Dealers everywhere sell them,
and a trial will convince you that it
is worth while to insist upon having

Don’t let ill-health
cloud your life.
Here is an offer of new health and new
life to all who are
Weak, Anaemic,
“Nervy,” “Run-down.”
Get well the “Wincarnis” way
—the quick, sure and safe way
to new and vigorous health.
The Quick way —because the
benefit begins from the first
wineglassfut, and increases
with every additional wine-
glassful. The Sure way —be-
cause it has given new health
and new life to countless
thousands of sufferers. • And
because it is recommended by
over 10,000 Doctors. The Safe
way—because it is the only
Wine Tonic of any repute that
does not contain drugs.
The first effect of “Wincarnis”
is an immediate stimulation
and invigoratioii of the whole
system. This is followed by
an actual up-building of bodily
vigor—an up-building that you
can feel —and which gives you
more strength and vitality
than you had before. And
each succeeding wineglassful
of “Wincarnis” creates still
more strength and still more
vitality, until soon your whole
body thrills with new health
and new life.
Then you can stop taking
“Wincarnis.”
But you still enjoy to the full the glorious
new health it has given you. That is where
4
w rvivvi'ff w * vwwww w
proves itself of enormous ad-
vantage over drugs and
drugged wines. Drugs stimu-
late, it is true ; but it is false
stimulation. And drugs make
you feel worse afterwards, be-
cause depress the heart.
Read wli at Mr. Edmunds says:
“Dear Sirs, I am delighted
with the new health your
world-famed ‘Winearnis’ has
given me. I have had such, a
busy season that I got ‘run
down.’ I was intensely weak
and quickly got exhausted. I
was induced to take a wine
tonic, which unfortunately
made me feel worse than ever.
I discovered afterwards that it
contained drugs. So I quickly
gave it up and tried ‘Win-
carnis’ instead. And it is won-
derful how speedily ‘Win-
carnis’ has made me feel a dif-
ferent being. It seemed to put
new life into me. I should
never have believed that any-
thing could do me so much
good, or do it as quickly as
‘Wine-amis’ has done. I only
wish I had tried it before.
—Yours faithfully, A. S.
Edmunds, 8112 Selwvn Road,
Cliftonville.” So you see that
the health that “Wincarnis”
gives is real and lasting health.
That is the health you want if
you suffer from Anaemia,
Weakness, Nerves, Sleepless-
ness, Exhaustion, Indigestion
or if you are “Run down.”
And it is real and lasting health
that “Wincarnis” offers you.
Will you try just one bottle?
Begin to get well TO-DAY.
“Wincarnis” is made in England by COLEMAN & CO., LTD.,
Wincarnis Works, Norwich. Yon can buy “Wincarnis” from
any Wine Merchant, Licensed Chemist or Grocer, but if you
experience any difficulty in obtaining it, write direct to the
Sole Distributing Agents, Fassett & Johnson, 5-7 Barrack
Street, Sydney.

Tooth Paste.
“I simply can’t account for this
trouble with my teeth —and I’ve
been so particular to keep them
immaculately clean always.” This
is the complaint of thousands.
It’s just this way, Madam.
You’ve spent your time watching
the highwaymen robbers of tooth-
health—Decay Germs —and for-
got all about their sly, insidious
accomplice, ‘‘Acid Mouth.” Acids
are constantly forming in the
mouth. They are constantly
‘‘working.” But they work
“incognito.”
And here lies the danger.
These mouth-acids, unmolested,
unsuspected, gradually dissolve,
and break down the enamel. The
tooth then becomes easy prey to
decay germs.
Look out for “acid mouth,”
that filcher and falcon of healthy
tooth life. Peheco Tooth Paste
users have a good chance to keep
their teeth for life.

Karl, the German.
Who will tell me, who determine
Why his heart should still be alien,
As he smokes there, Karl, the German,
Thirty years and more Australian?
Round about him, rich as marrow, _
Lie his acres, spread and splendid ;
Thirty years, with plough and harrow,
Has he tilled their breadth, and tended.
Yon and yonder dwell his neighbors.
Are his thoughts of them, I wonder —
Or of bloody sounds and sabres,
Screaming shells and guns that thunder?
Were the Prussian ten times over
Blasted with his country’s blindness,
In her madness —still her lover—
Could he all forget their kindness?
Yet his pipe-bowl fades and whitens,
And, caught up to heights elysian,
Lo! his country flames and brightens,
Like a large orb on his vision !
Thus he hears her broadsides thunder,
Thus he sees her mighty, regal—
Sees the round world cowering under
Prussian heel and Prussian eagle;
Sees —though spacious plains environ
(Following where his wishes lead him)
Prussia’s crushing grip of iron
Tense upon the throat of Freedom.
So she stands with flowers to wreath her,
Laurels thick and brave upon her;
Prostrate in the mire beneath her
Liberty and Truth and Honor!
Karl the German ! Time shall wither
Ere thy dream her scroll disgraces !
Thank the Fates that sent thee hither,
Set thy feet in pleasant places;
Gave thee wheat-land, gave thee wine-land,
Gave thee sunshine such as never,
Warming all thy storied Rhineland,
Ripened grapes by stream and river.
Fangs of wolf and claw of vulture,
Tooth and talon —who would cherish?
German faith and German culture
Likewise, scorned of man, shall perish.
Karl the German ! old and hoary,
Smoke thy pipe and love thy neighbor;
Quit thy dreams of power and glory;
Plough and harrow wait thy labor.
N.s.w.
RODERIC QUINN.
The Strangle Tree.
Though you make a detour wide
An you would not wish to see,
Steal but one brief glance aside
And you’ll find the strangle-tree!
Stark as Death and bare of leaf,
Many a mile it may be seen,
Grey as is the hair of Grief,
Like a spectre ’mid the green!
Bleached by rain and scarred by storm,
Taller than the forest things;
Lifting up a draggled form.
Turning, turning as he swings.
He that played a caitiff part,
So we left him to the gales,
With a red sin in his heart
And the life-blood on his nails.
What though priest with power to shrive,
Placed no blessing on his head,
We who hated him alive
Should we fear him now he’s dead?
Yet to pass the strangle-tree,
Squire and man and maid would blench!
All save one of low degree—-
She, the toll-gate keeper’s wench.
For each morning, all alone,
Fares she forth, the gossips say;
With her basket full of stone
For to drive the birds away!
Simple folk as she goes by
Nudge each other; lass and lad
Each avoid her roving eye.
All the village call her mad.
And they say that, rain or fair,
Hies she to that silent place,
There to pray a mumbled prayer
Gazing at his swollen face.
For though Evil must atone,
And the tainted hand must pay,
E'en the hangman's heart of stone
Cannot drive her love away!
MAORILAND.
BOYCE BOWDEN.
Ballade of a Dark Lady.
At many shrines I knelt of old,
But in the mists of yesterday
Felice the fair and Babs the bold,
Whose tresses were as new-mown hay,
Now dwell; while I may homage pay
To one with charms more rich and rare
Than theirs, or those of Madge and May—
I love a Maid with Midnight Hair!
The trivial tales are quickly told
Of loves that languish and decay;
No fond illusions do I fold
Concerning Madeline or Fay.
Dark Madeline a wisp of gray
Disdained to hide, and Fay was fair,
But now, in quite another way,
I love a Maid with Midnight Hair!
A cataract of living gold
About Tot’s shoulders used to play;
Jean’s nut-brown strands, but loosely rolled,
Each vagrant zephyr led astray;
Blue-eyed Phrynet'te, insanely gay,
Red tresses flaunted free from care,
But, though these still their charms array,
I love a Maid with Midnight Hair!
L’Envoi.
Eros, beneath your kindly sway,
Of blisses I have known my share;
But for no further boon I pray-
I love a Maid with Midnight Hair!

WILHELM VON POLYPHEMUS.
In estimating the possible duration of the
war it is necessary always to remember that
Germany is the modern Polyphemus, with
only one eye. An army bereft now of the
services of aeroplanes is almost as sightless
as a blind giant in a dark cave,
and almost as impotent. Though the
enemy’s guns may be decimating it from
behind an adjacent hill, the position of the
batteries can only be guessed at, and the
chances against dealing with them are im
measurable. Vast reinforcements may be
approaching with hostile intent. The army
without aeroplanes can only make its dis-
positions when the foe heaves in sight. What
gives vision to the aeroplanes—the article
without which it is a mere tangle of wood
and metal —is petrol. In the matter of
petrol Germany, by comparison with the
Allies, is one-eyed. It has what remains of
the stock which was accumulated for a war
that was not expected by its military chiefs
to last longer than six months; and it has
what it has been able to import in the last
six months from neutral countries. It is
already impossible, in Germany, according to
returned travellers, to buy motor-spirit of
any sort for private use. The unhappy
Deutscher’s car is mouldering in a garage
when it hasn’t been commandeered for mili-
tary purposes; and there is no benzine to
exorcise the stains of the beer and sauer-
kraut from its owner’s waistcoat. When the
end of the State’s supply comes, the uncouth
bully of Europe may be in as agonising and
helpless a position as his inebriated Sicilian
prototype was when the fire-stick entered
his brain.
* * * *
There is also the matter of legs, and the
problem of arms. A modern nation, obsessed
with the “will to conquer”—Teuton for
the “resolve to rob” —denends as much on
strong arms and swift legs as any raiding
nuisance in all mythology. Germany, so
long as it hopes to sustain its role of Poly-
phemus, must hit hard and move briskly.
For that it requires plenty of rubber and
copper. An army without well-tyred motor
vehicles is in as invidious a position as a
burglar with locomotor ataxia. It is at all
times liable to fall down and be stumbled
over, and beaten flat, and hurried off to
gaol. And an army without ample copper is
like a pugilist with a broken hand. It can
neither defend nor attack effectively. Unless
the reports from the world’s markets mis-
represent the position, the Hun has em-
barked on the most gigantic steal in history
handicapped at the very least by (1) failing
sight, (2) corns on both feet, and (3)
rheumatism of the arms —all of which com-
plaints are liable to develop into cases of
complete disablement. #
The enemy’s petrol-shortage is stressed in
nearly all his own papers. As regards
rubber, however, it is claimed that, "with
good foresight, Germany got in a great sup-
ply before the war.” But rubber does not
keep. By no means can it be prevented from
quickly perishing. Nor does the yarn as- to
large supplies carry conviction when viewed
from another aspect. In the year before
the war Germany and Austria exported be-
tween them £7,523,000 worth of rubber
goods. This represented a fair average year’s
output. As they have never taken more
than about 15 per cent, of the world’s sup-
ply, it is hard to see the margin for a store
of State-owned rubber. But whatever the
stock in hand may be there is certainly no
more arriving. Britain has complete control
of the world’s rubber. It began by prevent-
ing the exportation of the raw substance to
any foreign port whatever. The U.S.A.,
which had been absorbing 45 per cent, of the
world’s production for years, were badly
scared. They were willing to do or promise
anything for the humble article which is
milked from trees, by naked savages. When
they were told that they could buy it
once more provided they undertook not to re-
export it in any form except to Britain, their
gratitude was boundless. Germany also
cheered Up considerably. But in the past
few days a blockade has been instituted
against Germany. Unlike the blockades of
the past it is apparently going to be almost
wholly effective. Things are thus made worse
than ever for the Hun. It looks as though
his legs will not be the same again till the
war is over.
* * * *
So far as copper is concerned, two things
are known for certain: That Germany had
not an abnormal supply—at any rate, in the
crude state —when the war began, and that
it is rapidly consuming what it has day and
night. The authorities have recently started
buying used copper cartridge cases and any-
thing else containing copper that can be
raked up on the battlefield. All the tele
phone and electric traction wires that can
be spared are being taken down and melted.
Civilians have been required to give up all
domestic utensils of copper throughout the
Empire. The Cologne Gazette mentioned
lately some of the articles which the nation
had other uses for. It implored the people
to see whether there was copper in their
curtain-rings, toys, door-knobs, gas and
water connections, clothes-pegs, lanterns,
lamps, band instruments, and so on. All
this may be further evidence of the Teutonic
passion for thoroughness. But on the princi-
ple that a man with a few sovereigns in the
bank does not commonly dry-blow the gut-
ters for the treasures that may lie there, it
looks suspicious. If copper really is short
in Germany, the time may come when the
latter-day Polyphemus will have nothing
left to fight with but his mouth.
* * * *
All these possibilities having been .can-
vassed, it remains to be said that they are
only possibilities. Their interest arises from
the fact that they may conceivably end the
war with dramatic suddenness. Meantime,
it is going on as if it meant never to stop.
The ravager of Europe may have only one
eye, but the organ is in good working order
at present. He is holding the approaches
to his cave with one strong hand, and dealing
out death and destruction with the other.
He is as quick a mover as any of his foes,
and as hard a hitter. If the Allied blockade
can blind him, or lop off a leg or an arm, it
will be a happy solution of a painful pro-
blem. It may be, though, that civilisation is
going to be less fortunate than Odysseus
was. If so, the world has an awful ordeal
before it.
THE ANTI-SOCIALISM OF LABOR.
The most striking feature of recent politics
has been Labor’s dislike of its own pro-
gramme. State Labor administrations do
nothing, by abolishing the imported-
Governor system, or wiping out the super-
fluous “Upper House” arrangement, or re-
ducing the membership of the Assemblies,
to cheapen government. Borrowing rages
more furiously than ever. About the only
distinction between the new condition of
things and the old is that different men are
handling the screws and perquisites of office.
Private Enterprise, which once quaked
with dread when it heard a Labor candi-
date talk, has become easy in its mind again. It
realises that Labor’s threats were only elec-
tioneering guff. In the biggest of the States
a British company has just secured a con-
tract to perform for the Government activi-
ties which, in the Toriest of countries, are
the business of Socialism. In the Federal
sphere the tariff is being attended to by a
body whose recommendations come in so
gradually that the present generation’s grand-
children seem unlikely to enjoy effective
Protection. Life under Labor in Australia
is a great time for foreign-traders, anti-
Socialists and opponents of democracy in
general.
* * * *
For many years this paper has been call-
ing for the establishment of stud-farms for
the breeding of army remounts. Labor Gov-
ernments came and went, and did nothing.
The idea, sometimes expressed, more often
implied, was that war was a long way off,
and, meanwhile, there were better things
to “blew” the nation’s money on than back-
blocks horse-farms. What the politicians
who used this argument meant was that
there were more vote-producing things. Now
war, on a gigantic scale, has arrived. Im-
perial horse-buyers are, in consequence, at
work in every State. The Government is
snapping up all the horses it can get for
its own use. It is no good repining at this
stage, but it may usefully be noted that had
stud farms been instituted, as they logically
should have been when the universal train-
ing system was started, they would have
paid the Empire in this crisis nearly- as well
as the local navy.
Stud farms being non-existent, the Gov-
ernment has had to do the next best thing
and buy its horses from dealers and breed-
ers. There are two ways of doing that.
Under the Socialistic system, which is fol-
lowed by Britain and other theoretically
anti-Socialistic countries, expert buyers of
recognised probity are employed at fixed
salaries, plus travelling expenses. It is
their business to drive hard bargains, and, in
general, do their best, for the State. Under
the Private Enterprise system, which is fol-
lowed by the nominally Socialistic adminis-
tration of the Commonwealth, an unsalaried
buyer is employed on a commission basis —
his chief aim being, in the nature of things,
to do the best possible business for himself,
so far as he honestly can. In one horse-
breeding State one dealer has, practically, a
monopoly of the business. It is true that a
beginning was made there with a Socialistic
buyer. A well-known man was engaged at
a fairly good salary. But his travelling ex-
penses were not found; he had to pay for
his purchases by means of vouchers (a hope-
less system in a trade which is, traditionally,
on a cash basis) ; and there was always
liable to be trouble about the certifying of
his horses. The Government quickly changed
that arrangement. A Private Enterprise
man was put on who gets no salary.
He makes a profit of so much on
each horse. Putting it as low as
£2, his monthly earnings must equal a
trust magnate’s. He is in a position to pay
cash in connection with every deal. His
own vet. sees and passes the horses. lie
probably buys the best available, since his
honesty is unquestioned, and he knows all
there is to be learned about the friend of
man. But there is no other check on his
movements, which is not exactly business
as the cynical world of commerce under-
stands it. And, finally, unless the Govern-
ment agent is less shrewd than he is reputed
to be, he is improving the shining hour in
another way. His quest of sound, young
four-year-olds and over naturally brings
him in touch with the State’s sound young
three-ycar-olds and under, which in conse-
quence of the drought are a drug on the
market. A good-quality animal of this divi-
sion is to be got for a ten-pound note. A
man who was buying horses on a vast scale
would be foolish if he did not sink his spare
cash in animals which, this time next year,
are almost certain to be worth double, or
treble, their present price, no matter how
the war fares.
* * * *
If Russia, which has been importing horses
on a tremendous scale of recent years, had.
done business on the same lines, the dealers
of Petrograd and Moscow would long since
have been millionaires. The allegedly effete
Muscovite autocracy was not, however, quite
so foolish. It employed soldier-buyers at a
fixed salary, and saved millions. There seems
no reason why Australia should act differ-
ently—except that its Government is sup-
posed to be run on Socialistic lines.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
More Scrap Heap.
Having spent many days hearing the elabor-
ated arguments of expensive counsel, and
more days considering what it was going to
do about the matter, the Inter-State Com-
mission ordered an injunction to issue
against the N.S.W. Government restraining
that second-hand outfit from further pro-
ceedings under the Wheat Acquisition Act.
The High Court has now intimated that the
Inter-State Commission’s injunction wasn’t
worth tuppence, because the Commission had
no authority to issue such a document or
order —in other words, that all the original
proceedings before Messrs. Piddtngton,
Swinburne and Lockyer were a waste of
money, a farce and a mockery of law. All of
this is calculated to give the community
cause for great admiration of the men who
fashioned the Inter-State Commission,
dressed it in the uniform of bogus authority,
and sent it forth to war armed with soft
nosed bullets and a bayonet rigid as a piece
of string. The intention behind the clauses
of the Constitution giving the Common-
wealth authority to appoint an Inter-State
Commission to handle the provisions relat-
ing to Trade and Commerce was undoubt-
edly that this tribunal should have powers
of adjudication and enforcement. This in-
tention. entrusted for verbal expression to
the eminent lawyers who drafted the Con-
stitution, has now been found by other
equally eminent lawyers (including one or
two of those who did the drafting, or, at any
rate, had their fingers in the job) not to
have been carried into effect by the words
used, with the result that the Federal Par-
liament, instead of, as it imagined, bringing
into existence a Court, created merely a
thing of shreds and patches—an instrumen-
tality of government with certain limited
functions ancillary to mere administration.
The essential part of the Act constituting
the Commission having been thus tossed out
of the High Court window as invalid, and
the Commission itself given an uppercut 'of
great violence, the question of what shall be
done with the corpse or remnant calls for
attention. Apparently without an amend-
ment of the Constitution the Commission
now has no other function than to wander
aimlessly round the continent hearing evi-
dence about the tariff. Its usefulness in this
direction long since became more than doubt-
ful. Taking the most charitable view of the
disembowelled remains now on hand, the
only conclusion possible seems to be that the
sooner they are buried the better. For the
rest, the High Court’s judgment contains one
hint to the Federal Parliament. When any
supposedly constitutional step is taken, a
friend should be put un to immediately chal-
lenge it in the High Court for the purpose
of finding out whether a second step can be
risked. Until we are prepared to scrap the
Constitution and bring in Unification, that
would be the ouickest way and the cheapest.
The cost of finding out that tliis Inter-State
Commission was a sham has been enormous.
The Cracked Federal Instrument.
Tiie High Court’s judgment on the con-
stitutional issue raised by the Common-
wealth Government’s challenge of the
N.S.W. Wheat Acquisition Act has been
received by several Bumbles who draw Min-
isterial salaries from the Ma State with
squeaks of much delight. People with a
bioader outlook, however, will regret that
the law is such as the corpipunity now finds
it to be. The judgment handed down ,by
the High Court adds another to the proofs
that the Constitution is so gravely defective
as to bear very little re'sgmblanoe.'tp.. tlje
instrument the people thought'
bargaining for. By the of. appro-
priation each State can now. w'ifho\ity‘ques-
tion, hold up trade at its borders
And the reason js not that any such t ravesty
on national government 'was < contemplated
in pre-Foderafion days, but 'that' the
Constitution, through defect in draftsman-
ship, allows it. So far as wheat is
concerned, the community could understand
the Commonwealth handling the situation
created by drought, not in the special inter-
ests of a particular section of the continent,
but according to the requirements of all
the people of Australia. What they were
unable to understand prior to this revela-
tion of Constitutional impotency on the
part of the national Government was the
reason for each State fiddling about with
ridiculous Boards and Commissions, regard-
ing the citizens of neighboring States as
aliens, and making a general mess of what
should really have been a national under-
taking. The case for amendment of the
Constitution is overwhelming, for the people
cannot be expected to sit quietly by and
accept without action so complete a leversnl
to what Federation was expected to yield
The Menace.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Germany will use every opportunity to starve
England in revenge for England’s starving Germany.
—Official statement.
Wilhelm the Hogman,
Slaughterer-general,
Tearer of treaties,
Heavyweight partner
Of death and destruction,
Spoke in the hearing
Of ships and of Zeppelins,
Cannon and howitzers,
Mine-fields and submarines,
Saying tremendously
“England shall starve!”
And the ships and Zeppelins and cannon
and howitzers and mine-fields and sub-
marines answered as one goat: “Eng-
land shall starve.”
Wilhelm the Hogman
Said it in August last,
Loudly and angrily.
August passed warmly,
September went gustily,
' Fretful October
Slid on to November.
London and Birmingham
Glasgow and Liverpool
Still had their bread and
Potatoes and beef.
And when Wilhelm asked what was doing ,
the ships and Zeppelins and cannon and
howitzers and mine-fields and sub-
marines gloomily murmured: “England
shall starve.”
Breakfast grew scarcer in
Munich and Wurtemberg;
Deadlier sausages
Raged in Berlin.
Dresden and Hanover
Used up in sauerkraut
Husks that the swine had
Declined to consume.
Wilhelm the Hogman
Observed it regretfully,
Marked how the old year
Went out with a frostbite,
And England had still a
Firm fork in the beef.
And when the slaughterer-general asked,
again what wds doing, the ships and
Zeppelins and cannon and howitzers
and mine-fields and submarines
answered thickly, with ’fog in their
throats: “England shall starve.”
Wilhelm the Hogman,
Scanning the oceans for
„ Murder and joy,
Saw where a merchant ship
Bumped by a submarine
Hurled to the planets wool,
Tallow and hides.
“There goes the dinner of
England,” he chortled loud ;
“Famished Westphalia
Shall yet be avenged.
AVrite it in jaewspapers,
Blow it on war-bugles,
Shout it in Mecklenburg:
. .... England shall starve!”
And the ships with barnacles on them and
the Zeppelins that had dropped bombs
on Norfolk turnip-fields and the cannon
that were getting worn out with noise
and the howitzers that were mostly
sitting in the mud and the mine fields
that hadn't yet been dragged away and
put to sleep and the active but in-
effective submarines murmured doubt-
fully but dutifully: “England shall
starve.”
England, despite the noise,
Still with a fork in beef,
Still with a crust of bread,
Even some artichokes,
Mustard and cress,
Heard with astonishment
Wilhelm remarking it:
“England shall starve.”
They hadn't noticed the remark before, for
they thought the ships and Zeppelins
and cannon and howitzers and mine-
fields and submarines were merely say-
ing: “England be blowed!”
Now in their wrath they rose.
This was the fatal word.
Hogmany’s arrogance
Aimed at their waistcoat girth,
Threatened the dining-room.
Large was their wrath.
Fiercely they spoke the word,
War-bugles echoed it,
Newspapers quoted it,
All men applauded it:
“Wilhelm shall hang!”
And the great ships without barnacles, and
the new armies without scars or fatigue
and the big guns that were already
overpowering those of the Hogman took
it up cheerfully and with enthusiasm —
“Wilhelm shall hang!”
N.S.W.
CURSE O’ MOSES.


Kitchener, Socialist.
The clash between military preparation and
Trade Unionism which has led Kitchener
to establish something like State Socialism in
England was not unlooked for. It is all very
well to denounce the workman as unpatri-
otic when he kicks at a time of national
crisis; but the man who turns the wheels
and grinds out the things Kitchener’s
armies require has the perfect right to retort
that you must give him something to be
patriotic about before you can expect a
white heat of patriotism. There are a good
many people in England who toil on from
year to year in a pretty hopeless fashion,
getting barely enough to eat, wearing the
coarsest clothing, with little in the way of
recreation, denied even the means of cleanli-
ness and health, to whom it can matter little
enough whether England comes out on top
in the present struggle or . Germany battles
her way through. Whoever is master the
European workman gets just as little as his
masters can afford to give him, and, like
Thomas Hardy’s Dorset peasant who could
see nothing beyond the eight shillings a
week on which he had to keep a family, he
is apt to be blind to those higher interests
on which the daily newspapers lay so much
stress. What are his higher interests? His
employers, representing to his mind the
nation, have narrowed those higher interests
down to the far-off hope of winning an extra
sixpence a day. It is not much on which
to found an ardent patriotism. Certainly,
if he knew, he has a better chance of getting
that sixpence under English masters than
under German : but he is to be pardoned if
he puts the Trade Union that fights for
him above the interests of the employer who
starves him. However galling it may be to
find the British workman hang back in the
traces when the nation wants all the pull
it can get, there can be very little doubt
that John Smith, workman, has won a
very big thing for himself by hanging back.
He has secured at one word of the military
authorities an advantage that he could not
have gained by a thousand strikes. He has
got his private employer wiped out and has
become the direct servant of the State, with
the hope of a share in profits and even a
chance of medals and decorations if he
puts his muscle into his work. That an
organiser like Kitchener sees the advan-
tage of this goes far to put matters in the
right light and show where the industrial
failure lay. It is not John Smith, work-
man, who has proved a failure: all that is
proved is that J. Smith has failed under
Private Enterprise. The organisation of him
and his fellow-workmen under a new sys-
men for war foreshadows their organisation
also for . peace. If England cannot afford
to have its gun-making and bullet-moulding
muddled by P.E. in time of conflict, it is
pretty clear that it cannot in time of peace
afford to let its manufacture of calico or
soap or iron bedsteads be muddled either.

The Soldier in the Workshop.
The big war now cleaning up Europe is
being fought in the workshop as much as in
the trenches. The man who goes to the
Front and takes the risks and the credit is
no more important than the man who stays
at home and constructs battle ironmongery.
This is a fact that is only beginning to force
its way into the intelligence of a lot of
people to whom it should have been a
commonplace 20 years ago. The Germans
were aware of it, and because they had long
ago put their knowledge into practice they
were able to score at the outset of the dis-
turbance, and have been able to hang on
against three great nations and a small one
through a long, bitter winter. In old days
when a nation went to war any of its citi-
zens who felt inclined or who happened to
be sober enough at the time went into their
own backyards and looked for an axe or
any other implement that was hard and
heavy. Once the axe was picked up the
soldier was armed and ready, and the battle
wrnnt to the side that could hit quickest and
hardest. All this is changed. A big gun
takes months to make ; a warship years. To
increase suddenly the manufacture of the
implements of battle is almost impossible.
It is first of all necessary to increase the
machinery for making them and to train the
men to use that machinery. England,
according to Kitchener, having manufac-
turing appliances at hand, has trebled the
output of war material since the Germans
rushed on Liege. It is a notable perform-
ance—perhaps the most notable performance
of the war—and one that must count for
more than all the gallant deeds done in the
fighting line; and because of it none can
doubt that the grim game is going
well. The lesson for Australia is
plain. The defence workshop must be put
in order quickly. The trained war mechanic
is as important as the other soldier, and the
work done 20 years before the day of test-
ing is the thing that will settle the argu-
ment when it arrives. The idea that Aus-
tralia has lots of time is the most pernicious
one conceivable. Time is the very thing
Australia cannot afford to squander. This
continent has some wealth—a good deal
of it potential rather than actual —a cer-
tain amount of pluck and resource, a mod-
erate supply of energy and enthusiasm, and
a vast quantity of the raw material of which
effective defence weapons can be built; but
time is the unknown quantity in the
national, problem. The man who knows the
burglar is coming but does not know whether
he will arrive at midnight or at five o’clock
in the morning will be well advised to get
bis revolver ready and huDt up the cart-
ridges the evening before. If he lets time
slip and goes out to try to buy a six-shooter
after the pubs are closed, the burglar may
have his plans ruined by falling over the
family cat, but the odds are much in favor
of his taking'away the pick of the wife’s
jewellery.

The Money Bug.
In the middle of December last the Censor
brought off a masterstroke by prosecuting
the: Perth Daily News for publishing a
description by a passenger l of the defences
of the Suez Canal. The charge said that it
amounted to giving “information which
mig|ht be of use to the .enemy.” Taking the
view that all a passenger could have seen
was as near nothing as possible, and that
anyhow the information was weeks old,
Davies, P.M., dismissed the case with scorn
and promptitude, and turned to the daily
array of drunks and disorderlies. Now that
the information is four months old and the
original rigmarole has been republished all
over the Commonwealth, the High Court
takes a hand. In the interval the enemy
has found out ten times more about the
defences of the Suez Canal —if only through
the medium of the survivors of the force
which left 200 dead Germans, not to men-
tion Turks, floating about in it—than any
tourist is likely to learn from the deck of
a liner. The proceeding illustrates the High
Court’s conception of its duties. In
Eather’s notorious case nothing more im-
portant than the liberty of an Australian
citizen was in issue. The High Court
couldn’t be bothered. This Perth matter
concerns money. Therefore no pains must be
spared. It can’t even be hung up till the High
Court gets in due course to the *Western
State. The case is hauled east to be argued
afresh, ,so that our highest tribunal may
decide whether the publication of the casual
impressions of a Canal passenger is likely
to shatter the foundations of the British
Empire. It is quite on the cards that, since
that tribunal has decided that it ought not
to interfere with the judgment of the lower
Court on a matter of fact, the costly absurd-
ity will be passing through the Canal
in question well after the war is over—on
its way to the Privy Council and further
costs. The paper has money, the Censor has
money, and the issue is money. This
Money bug is almost our worst pest.

One Way Australia Can Help.
“W.8.D.” proposes to make four loaves out
of three: —
The intention of the N. S. Wales Government to
make a State monopoly of the bakery trade is not
the novel thing it looks. In Germany and France
the production of “war bread” synchronised with
mobilisation. Morally the proceeding is sound so
far as N. S. Wales is concerned. When the Common-
wealth Government announced at the beginning of
the war that it was “with Britain to the last ear
of wheat” it said a big thing, for it is partly on
Australia that Britain and the Allies depend for
bread. It is hard for the well-fed citizen of the
British Empire to realise how important wheat is.
They can best do so by looking through the eyes of
people such as the captain of the Prinz Eitel Fried-
rich, who was prepared to risk war with the United
States for the sake of sinking a cargo of it; 01 of
Admiral von Tirpitz, who has willingly lost 12
submarines on the off-chance of destroying a ship-
load here or there. Tirpitz and his friends under-
stand its value well. They are living on potato-
bread. And even of that debased food a recent
Berliner Tageblatt said: “Take care of it as if
it were holy. Do not squander even a crumb.”
The measure of Hans’s incapacity to supply himself
with wheaten flour may be taken by Britain, where
the cost of living has risen 25 per cent, in spite of
a command of the seas more absolute than that of
Nelson’s day. Thanks to Australia’s Foreign Trade
party, which consistently set its face against the
establishment of factories for the creation of muni-
tions of war, Australia has been able to do little
enough so far in the matter of supplying armies to
the Empire. But if N. S. Wales and every other
State took a firm grip of the bread question, and
produced the right sort of loaf, they could effect in
combination a sufficiently substantial saving on
wheat at present wasted to bring about an appreci-
able reduction in the cost of living in the United
Kingdom as well as here. This can be done by
establishing what is called the Standard loaf. The
establishment of this would set free for Britain
that 25 per cent, of our own wheat consumption
which is now wasted. In 1911 the Harmsworth
Press started a campaign in the. United Kingdom
in favor of this loaf. It was taken into use at
Windsor Castle, and thereupon everybody commenced
to use it. The point was that in order to secure
white flour the more nutritive parts of the wheat
berry were thrown away. The Daily Mail, “follow-
ing the advice of eight of the most eminent physi-
cians and surgeons of the United Kingdom, urged
the millers and bakers of the country to produce
and sell flour and bread containing 80 per cent, of
the wheat grain.” Experiments made by “the lead-
ing physiologists of England, France and Russia”
showed that bread made from “standard” flours was
5 per cent, more “nourishing, life-sustaining, and
made stronger men and women than the anaemic
sterilised white flour of the modern roller mill.” The
same paper said that 25,000,000 sacks of a white
flour absorbed by Britain last year were produced
by discarding 40 per cent, of the wheat grain—-a
waste of about 10,000,000 sacks. In “household
flour” 30 per cent, of the grain is discarded. “Should
the Government order the bakers to produce at once
a loaf containing the whole of the grain, less per-
haps 5 per cent, of hard exterior bran, the bakers
would probably be able at once to add' 25 per cent,
to the loaf production of the country.” There has
been any amount of talk about the sacrifices Aus-
tralia is prepared to make. Here is a great service
which isn’t even a sacrifice. Up to date we have
sunk the Emden, cleared the Pacific of Germans,
helped to hold Egypt, and with any luck are likely
to play a substantial part in taking Constantinople.
If in addition this country could lower the cost of
living in the United Kingdom by 5 per cent, it
would be doing almost as much as if it sent another
army corps.
Melbourne’s Civic Birds Foul Their Own
Nest.
Melbourne City Council has frankly con-
fessed itsejf a friend of Tammanyism and a
patron of log-rolling. Councillor Atkins,
who is a comparatively young municipal
business man, moved
That the tender be declared invalid of any ten-
derer for works or supplies to the corporation who
approached a councillor between the time of lodging
a tender and the date of acceptance thereof.
Presumably a glaring instance of personal
appeal to the city fathers, and of jobbery
resulting from it had recently occurred,
though Atkins, after the manner of one who
throws out a hint instead of casting an
aspersion, went on to say he “did not imply
that there had been improper practices.”
The motion merely asserted the good princi-
ple that all tenders should be considered on
their merits, and all councillors should be
protected from the importunities,of \yhisper-
ers who want the Council to have no good
principles at all. This aroused the siporn of
Henry Weedon, ex-Mayor. He depounced
the motion as “somewhat of a reflection on
the Council,” and evidently thought that any-i
thing in the way of a reflection on his little
self was a disgrace to the country. Ten-
derers, according to Weedon, shouljfl
full liberty to approach councillors impro-
perly, seeing that he and his brethren “know
how-to treat these people in a proper man-
ner. The Atkins motion had, of course,
proposed to treat them properly by cancel-
ling their tenders, whereas Weedon’s con-
ception of proper treatment might mean a
drink for aught he explained to the contrary,
lhis, indeed, was so obvious that brother
Labena advised his fat colleagues not to
turn the down lest they would seem
to offer “an invitation to tenderers to come
along.” Nevertheless the Council did turn
it down as “impracticable.” Members had
been warned by Cabena not to leave them-
selves under suspicion; yet they deliberately
declined to put theipselves above it. They
preferred to admit that, as long as tenderers
think it worth while to interview them, they
will submit to be interviewed—and endure
the insult.

It was refreshing to get straight from
Paris the confession that French military
strategy was a series of costly mistakes at
the outset. The truth had no chance of
getting to the public until it was officially
statednow. it comes as one of the most
reassuring bits of war news we have re-
ceived. In plain English the Germans
carried everything before them in Northern
I ranee merely because the defence was not
properly planned. When the German fight-
ing machine was at its very best, the
French machine was at its very worst. The
invaders were working according to time-
table ; the French armies had no time-table.
They missed chances to stop the invasion
and lost ground they never should have lost.
The fact is candidly owned up to, and the
candor inspires confidence. It is reassur-
ing, too, in that it discounts the credit given
to German prowess in August. As soon as
the resistance became cohesive the German
masses ceased to be “irresistible”—which
was so horribly surprising to the Kaiser
that he sacked Yon Moltke, his boss
strategist, and has made no advance to
speak of since.
The Peace cranks appear to be equally
Teutonic in their humorlessness a'nd in
their ideas of what ought to happen to
belligerents after the war. One Dillon,
hon. sec. of the Melbourne society, told his
brethren the other night that “the society
must insistently demand peace in the
future.” Its business is to see that there
be “no more wars, whether just or unjust.”
Wherefore Dillon, taking his pen in his
hand, will be prepared to touch any right-
eously indignant, or unrighteously comba-
tive, nation on the shoulder and say: “Now,
stop it! No fighting!” As regards the pre-
sent war, which has got beyond even
Dillon’s fountain-pen, he proposes an all-
round return to “as you were” in territorial
government; but when Belgium and France
are cleared of the invader Dillon will insist
on “a disbanding of the German and Aus-
trian armies. and navies.” Also he will
demand an indemnity from Germany to-
wards rebuilding in Belgium and Poland,
and an indemnity from France for a like
purpose in Alsace-Lorraine. But no pay-
ments of indemnity towards the cost of the
war! Finally Dillon, on behalf of the
Peace Society, will insist on “free trade
between belligerent countries,” so that Aus-
tralia may be rewarded for its belligerency
by a flood of goods made in Germany and
elsewhere. But Dillon missed one point:
Turkey, of course, must also be compen-
sated for any damage done to its civilisation,
and its rulers must be permitted to go on
ruling as before. The first qualification for
a Peace party is surely a constitutional in-
ability to see a joke.
«
“Full Astern” : Last Anniversary Regatta
day the skipper of a Sydney ferry steamer
was threading his way through the mos-
quito fleet and at the same time trying to
keep to the holiday time-table. During the
process he collided with a sailing-boat, whose
movements had been hidden. For this he
was towed before a magistrate a few days
ago, and, despite the obvious extenuating
circumstances, was fined £lO. The Court
said it had no option, since, according to
the Act, a steamship shall keep out of the
way of a sailing vessel. The trouble is that
the Act was passed for vessels on the high
seas, where there is unlimited room; but, as
there is only one Act, it applies also to
traffic on crowded, narrow harbors. I sub-
mit that it is up to the Harbor Trust to
make some sort of a local rule imposing a
duty on boats and the like craft to keep a
clear track. After all, for the tens who use
boats thousands use the ferries, and as the
law stands a crowded ferry can be delayed
unreasonably by any fool in a dinghy who
likes to claim the rule of the road. It is a
common thing for a boat-load of “sports”
to make a feint of crossing a steamer’s bows.
The skipper rings full speed astern, yells
“Hard a port” and “Stand by the lifeboat.”
Then, when the steamer pulls up all stand-
ing, the pleasure boat’s helm goes down and
she steers off, the crew politely putting their
fingers to their noses. The wife-beater,
milk-adulterator and backyard-thief must be
a shocking offender to earn a £lO fine, but
a worried, trying-to-do-his-best ferry-master
can expect it at his first anpearance, and
may thank his stars it isn’t £2O.

“E.L.C.W.” invites attention to a way they
have of handling the beer question in South
Africa: —
The men who ran over to draw a bead on the
Boer will remember the bright splash of color in
Natal towns made by the native ladies. On market
day in Durban they were to be seen walking in
single file down the street, each balancing a big gourd
of native beer on her head. The making of the
native concoction of mealies and kafir corn—
utswala —was for a long time quite unrestricted.
Every house brewed all it wanted and a generous
supply for the neighbors. But with civilisation
came the industrialisation of the stuff; it was brewed
for sale, and with not much regard for purity. The
towns filled up with kafirs working in shops and
houses, and as their families were in distant kraals,
the “boys” had nothing to put in their off-time with
but beer. And they put it in well. The Monday lists at
court grew weekly longer, for the trade got mixed up
with surreptitious fire-water sales and consequent
murderous outbreaks. Something had to be done.
So the Natal Leg. Ass. passed an Act enabling muni-
cipalities to brew and sell kafir beer and to sool
-off* the native-woman manufacturer. Durban adopted
the Act (1908), and with such success that other
towns fell in line, and no«r Pietermaritzburg, New-
castle, Ladysmith, Vryheidand Grey town all run
municipal beer halls. Durban makes a nice little
profit of £25,000 per annum on this side-line alone.
The Act requires that the profits made by the trade
in kafir beer shall be earmarked for the service of
the natives, and it goes for hospitals, schools, etc.,
for their behoof. In the Transvaal the municipalisa-
tion of the liquor trade is also permissible. But
the Transvaal never got any forrarder, although the
Rand, with its quarter of a million native workers
—anything from 50 to 75 per cent, are drunk on
Monday—wants a municipalisation scheme badly, one
of the best features of such control being that it
does ensure the supply of decent stuff, and prevents
the maddening of men by the serving of mixtures of
Dop Doctor, with a little methylated spirit and vitriol
to make them bite.
♦
A further instance of the untidiness of
Victoria’s. Price of Foods Board is afforded
by its “injurious differentiation” between
butter and wheat. At present, when the
farmer hasn’t any wheat to sell, having long
since sold it to millers or large holders, he
is allowed by the Board to charge any old
price he can get—that is, he could charge
it if he had any. On the other hand, the
butter grower has butter to sell, though
it is costing him much more than it usually
does ; so the Board fixes the price for him
at Is. 2d. —which is rather less than usual
at this time of year. Furthermore, when
the precious Board formerly “regulated”
wheat, it also fixed the retail price of bread ;
but though it has settled the wholesale price
of butter at the aforementioned Is. 2d., it
has said nothing to the retailer, who is
charging Is. 6d. and Is. Bd. for the same
article. The unlovely point about this dif-
ferentiation is that nine-tenths of the wheat
in the State, other than seed, is in the hands
of large holders ; whereas nine-tenths of the
butter which is being produced and sold
to-day belongs to small farmers and their
co-operative societies. In studying the in-
terests of consumers and producers and
stamping on those of middlemen. Peacock’s
Foods Board is simply a marvel.
While the N. S. Wales Government has
been fluting about its devotion to the “cheap
loaf,” and sacrificing the cocky as a burnt-
offering on the shrine of economy, and pro-
claiming its readiness to crucify the “big
buyers” (who were at once surreptitiously
given nice, easy jobs on a fat commission),
great silence broods over everything con-
nected with the price of beef. Acting on the
representations of the British Government, a
measure was passed by the N.S.W. Assem-
bly a few weeks ago giving the Ministry
authority to acquire meat required for the
War Office. This provides that for any meat
so commandeered a fair market price should
be paid. The immediate result was the
bringing of many heads very close together,
and the consummation of “an arrangement”;
and, finally, instead of paying the indivi-
duals who hold beef in store the current
market rate, the Government has rushed in
and handed out l|d. per lb. more for meat
than it was being sold for to local butchers.
The deal covers 30,000 quarters; and no
valid explanation of the liberality with an
extra £30.000 of another Government’s
money has been made. Obviously if there is
now a huge buyer in the market ready to pay
more for meat than it has been locally sold
for, the consequence will be to push up the
already high price the Sydney citizen has
to pay for the steak and sirloin which are
wearing down his teeth to the gums.. The
anxiety of Holman and his henchman,
Hall, to save the aforesaid citizen sixpence
a week on his bread bill, and their apparent
disregard of the cost of meat, would in the
case of any other set of men call for ex-
planation. But with Holman away on the
usual holiday and Hall orating in S. Aus.
about the cost of living, the whole weary
business is just passed with a shrug of the
shoulders in the old way.
■%.
Earle Hermann, who was sent up the
other day by a Sydney Judge for three years,
was mainly one of the by-products of the
boom in P.N.’s and lOU’s. An adven-
turer, backed by 'great audacity, he
arrived in Sydney from South Africa
and felt his feet just when the reck-
less public borrowing was getting into
full blast. Dropping into the swim, he set
up in business as a financier, agent, promoter
of companies, broker, and all that sort of
thing, in offices of great pomp and impres-
siveness. For a time the man’s success was
remarkable and his profits (on paper) dazz-
ling. All manner of people were his clients;
he became known to everyone as a kind of
financial wizard. But as had been the case
with many such a one before, and will hap-
pen often enough again, Hermann was
cooked as soon as the boom began to totter.
Cash became short and loans difficult to
negotiate; the fraudulent p.n. and the meet-
ing of creditors followed ; finally the dock and
charges of forgery and uttering and the
desperate defence of insanity.. Using the
word in the loose way, it is perhaps true
that Hermann was mad ; but such madness
comes to every reckless gambler who fails to
back a winner. If such evidence as was
tendered had been successfully advanced, no
offender charged with embezzlement or for-
gery, or indeed any other crime, need have
been again convicted in N. S. Wales. The
way out would have been made easy. Still
it had its uses, this yarn about cerebral
irresponsibility ;■ for the jury acquitted on
the charge of forgery, convicting only of
uttering. All that can be said is that
Hermann was fortunate in his counsel, and
in his judge and jury; and viewed from the
standpoint of moral guiltiness, the repara-
tion asked of him by the Law makes the
majority of sentences passed in the same
Court look brutal.

At the time Lucy wrote no answer was
forthcoming; but Fatmen were still singing
“Sons of the Seize” and other stout patri-
otic ballads. Incidentally, in the same issue
of the newspaper appeared the opinion of
Sydney’s ex-Mayor, Allen Taylob, M.L.G.
(Ma’s Landlords’ Council), on the subject
of day labor v. the contract system. He
was asked by Solly, chairman of the Vic-
torian Housing Commission, whether, in the
event of a national or municipal housing
scheme being carried out, he would favor
the work being done by day labor or con-
tract. Said Taylor, in the firm voice of a
man who knows what he’s talking about,
“Day labor would mean disaster.” But as
contract is so liable to spell disaster, too,
what’s to be done? It seems to be a ques-
tion of hanging somebody, or at least sending
somebody to gaol.
With Italy getting ready for mobilisation,
Itoumania edging closer to her guns each
day, and the Bulgars swung intj line along
their southern frontier, the position in
Southern Europe is for the moment one of
tense uncertainty. Should all these people
come into the fray, the Turk will be pricked
by a hostile bayonet on every side; and
unless Allah comes along at the last
minute and spirits him aloft to sit on
Mahomet’s coffin, it looks a!s if the aggre-
gate Unspeakable is going to get seriously hurt.
On the northern battle lines the position
remains practically the same, although it
seems as if the Russians were at last break-
ing through into Hungary and establishing a
permanent ascendancy in that field of opera-
tions. In Flanders all parties are pulling
themselves together for another effort. The
losses at Neuve Chapelle indicate how gigan-
tic the struggle for mastery ' among the
trenches and barbed-wire entanglements is
going to be. The hope that. the war might
be quickly terminated —that is, within a few
months—finds little justification anywhere.
Its duration will depend entirely upon the
number of men the Allies can bring to bear
against the resisting Hun; and as this objec-
tionable person knows a lot about the art
and practice of scrap, the turning of men
into soldiers with the greatest possible
degree of speed must now and until the con-
flict is over be the main objective of every
belligerent nation. The time for singing “Te
Deum” is as far away as Tipperary; but the
time for every available man to prepare to
take his place in the ranks is with us now.
To break the German attack is alone a
mighty task. To overcome a Germany, re-
sisting invasion will require the serious
attention of all hands and the cook.
The defeat of the Peake Government in S.
Aus. on Saturday means less than usual.
No big question of policy was at stake.
Uncommonly sensible concerning most things.
S. Aus. has just about persuaded itself that
there isn’t much to choose between parties,
however much there may be between men.
Hence, since a large proportion of the
people are not tied tight to either crowd, and
since neither crowd performs up to its pro-
mise, the State has more or less got into the
habit of kicking out its Government every
time it goes to the poll. Had Labor been in
office it probably would now. have felt the.
boot; as it happens, the accidental Peake
was there, so he suffers.. Crawford
Vaughan, who will succeed him, is untried
as a Premier. But he has large capacity :
and he has a solid following. In both of
these respects he has an advantage over his
predecessor, who was merely a time-server,
leading a thing of shreds and patches.
According to the present look of the plebis-
cite in S. Aus., the number o$ people who
want to see Bung put up the shutters at o
o’clock is considerably greater than the tally
of citizens desirous of keeping the pump at
work until 11; and soon the convivial souls
of Adelaide will have to either do without
wassail o’ nights or rush round during busi-
ness hours and capture the flowing bowl in
a bottle. Whether they will by this method
continue to capture as much as before re-
mains to be seen ; but if they try hard enough
the probabilities are that they may succeed
and keg-parties will become fashionable.
“Dn": I see that Julius Ashton has
written Rodin, the great French sculptor, to
the effect that, if he have any more precious
stones like those he lately bestowed upon
John Bull, Sydney will be glad to house
one of them. It may be interesting
to artistic Australians to know that Aus-
tralia a very few years ago had an oppor-
tunity of securing several magnificent
Rodins, or its pick of the bunch, which in-
cluded replicas of some of the sculptor’s
finest groups, at ridiculously low rates.
Ambrose Patterson, the Vic. artist, coming
from Europe, was commissioned to find
buyers for these replicas; and although he
knew he had a good thing and hawked it
assiduously, not a single buyer here, public
or private, would give the goods as much
attention as would have been bestowed upon
the samples had Fatterson been trading in
soap.

There isn’t much excuse for the manager
who finds Australia a rocky road. One of
this indebted country’s great natural
resources is a supply of feminine youth and
beauty; and, so long as a manager remem-
bers to tap it occasionally and make up a
panto, company, he can revive his fortunes
and pick up the money he didn’t make with
Bernard Jaw or “Beyond the Beyond,” the
intense society problem play that crawled for
1200 nights' in London and New York.
These theatrical by-products are really only
meant to keep playgoers alive and managers
amused between pantos. “Sinbad the Sailor,”

Rickaby (1) curses Carrots (2), sings “PC
49” (3) a nd cracks a joke: “I went in to a
swagger hotel this morning to get a cigar—
when some damned fool trod on my fingers."
the Bilanderson effort now running at Syd-
ney Adelphi, makes its progress mostly on
the shapely limbs of girls who are too
numerous to mention on the programme.
They sing any old thing with vim, and dance
joyously till the lights go out and it is time
for the two false-alarm sailor humorists to
totter on and howl unconvincingly in each
other’s faces. Or if the girls are not chased
off by them, it is the female old man of the
sea who obtrudes. These three hard-work-
ing characters should not be administered to
any audience without chloroform. The
amazing Maggie Moore wears so youthful a
face as Mrs. Sinbad that the usual insulting
panto, gags rebound from the greasepaint-
armor and fall flat. She has more real
vivacity, not to mention humor, than many
a modern ragtime lady, and her voice is still
sweet and true. Broadly speaking, she really
justifies the enthusiasm of the older genera-
tion of playgoers. Olive Marston, who wears
the principal tights, curves generously, and
obliges with a nigger serenade and shuffle
in the forgotten pre-ragtime manner. Only
an old practitioner could do it. Harry
Burgess, late of “The Grafters” co., is gen-
uinely amusing with legs and face, and the
stage manners and singing voice of Rita
Renas are very soothing. The humorous
acrobatic interludes of Morris and Momo
earn honorable mention; likewise the sing-
ing of John Ralston. But the main prop of
the show is Youth —which, in addition to
the usual modest wage, asks only a pretty
dress and music to set its eager feet going.

Julius Knight will cease to apply for his
Royal Divorce after to-night (Thursday). On
Saturday evening “The Lifeguardsman” is
due at Sydney Royal; and when his spurs
and military haberdashery vanish _ from the
scene, there will be no more Knight for a
long while. The production, in fact, is
billed as a farewell; but the chances are
that it is just the usual so-long-for-the-
present.

The glittering Cinderella panto, is settling
down nicely at Her Majesty’s, Sydney, and
sorting out its elegant legs. Barry Lupino,
who has sworn off red nose-paint for the
production, emerges successfully from the
terrific voluntary test, and the only fault of
the show seems to be that there is too much
of it. But, then, isn’t every good panto,
expected to suffer from obesity ?

Despite the absence of the official Starr,
“Bought and P_aid For,” with Sylvia Bremer
in the big part, continues at Sydney Cri-
terion to provide good United States melo-
drama at the usual prices. A second con-
sideration of William Harrigan and Dorothy
Davies leads this paper to credit them with
making the fourth act the most interesting
of the play. Harrington’s part, that of
James Gilley, fits admirably ; he manages to
make this blatapt specimen of New York
clurkdom human as well as humorous. Dor-
othy Davies who, on the first night, was
held to be neither good nor bad, is now given
the benefit of the doubt, and is informed that
she is more good than bad in a part that
requires some acting. If this critic went a
third time, it is quite possible that he would
arrive in such a mellow mood that he would
regard Dorothy Davies as a delightful artist.

The first annual meeting of subscribers to
the Sydney Repertory Dramatic Society,
held in the Repertory Theatre last Thurs-
day evening, was not as dreary as most
annual meetings. For two one-act plays
were performed, “The Human Document,”
an Australian play by Montague Grover, and
“Little Sloe Eyes,” a Cockney play by
Frederick Ward. Grover’s play dealt
dramatically with “crook” life, and, despite
its amateur cast, stood out as an interesting
and cleverly-constructed bit of stage realism,
worthy of resurrection for the Australian
public. Gilburt Howell, the producer, and
Dr. Foster were consistent in their respect-
ive parts of a dealer in stolen goods and a
detective; but Miss Dowland failed to grasp
in its entirety the character of the dealer’s
“ruined” daughter. “Little Sloe Eyes”
had the advantage of production by profes-
sional actors, and Frederick Ward and Eily
Maly on brought out fully the theatric value
of a rather slight playlet, though in stressing
the pathos Miss Malyon became sometimes
inaudible.

The Irish Pipers, under the Tait manage-
ment, opened their two nights’ season in the
Sydney Town Hall on Saturday. Murphy
claims that his wind-bags are the daddies of
their species, and that the first Mackenzie
who piped on his cold Caledonian, hilltops is a
mushroom compared with the minstrels who
skirled as Brian Boru stuck a shamrock in
his belt and marched into battle at Clontarf.
The Irish-Australian Pipers are led by pipe-
major Yeale, a broth of a boy supported by
a fine pair of calves. At the first
concert, the pipes, the best part of
the company’s outfit, gave forth such
stirring shrieks, notably in the War Pipe
Duet, that an Emerald Isle audience simply
broke out into a volcano of applause. Of
the vocalists, a young soprano. Vera Carew,
may be dismissed with a caution against gasp-
ing for breath in unexpected places; and
the other soloists and the dancers were
better in intention than performance.

Wirths’ tented field at Prince Alfred Park

Religious Editor took his infant last week,

splendid tribute to the expensive realism of
the show, which looks like the contents of
several picture-books. There had previously
been a horrible misunderstanding before the
bath-cage of the blood-sweating hippo, when
that remarkable animal gladly opened its
hinged head to the full extent to receive
one wretched peanut from a generous
patron. The most frenzied explanations and
guarantees were required before peace was
restored and it was possible to report busi-
ness as usual.

“High Jinks,” having served its Sydney
turn, came to Her Majesty’s (Melb.) last
Saturday, and got all the welcome it de-
served. The crude title of this broad cari-
cature of French farcical comedy fully
explains the case, so the statement that it
is a mere musical jollity seems unnecessary.
As regards the names of author and com-
poser, the programme preserves a dead
silence, but their joint address can be sur-
mised —they probably have their workshop
in the caverns of memory. The plot is a
farrago of familiar social indiscretions, re-
lieved by the incredible simplicity of a
matron and a maid, the maid being an art-
less serio-chronic who has strained her
throat whilst warbling at the Folies Ber-
geres. The various indiscreet persons are
married or otherwise when in Paris, but
when they go to a seaside pub they mostly
get registered as the wrong husband or
wife, and their only means of escape from
the Divorce Court is by sniffing a perfume
which makes everybody joyful for five
minutes. But the perfume is inconsistent in
its influence ; hence, whereas Dorothy Brun-
ton bursts into romantic song after sniffing
it, others begin to dance, whilst Florence
Vie, the naughty stout lady of the piece,
wants to moisten her happiness with more
champagne. It is all very frivolous and
very remindful of French farces in general.
Also at its best the music is rather a noisy
jumble of echoes of bygone strains, the air
which falls to festive Dorothy being sugges-
tive of “The Chocolate Soldier.” At its
worst it is tattered ragtime.

None of the principals, bar Florence Vie
and Paul Plunket, are naturally suited to
their characters; but Fisher Rawlins, Ger-
trude Glyn and Marie Eaton fill their places
fairly. Dorothy Brunton is an engaging
charmer as usual, and Workman is a droll
comedian disguised as a devoted lover. The
orchestra performs its monotonous duties
with undue vigor in some cases, and the
chorus lives a strenuous life on account of
frequent changes of costume. All the remain-
ing possibilities of concerted gesture and
movement are exhausted by the hard-worked
choristers. No matter how much a week
they get for their long series of drill forma-
tions and Sandow exercises, these automatic
auxiliaries are not overpaid. Finally, the
painters’ work is picturesque, and little
Novotna and Victor Lauschman contribute
a charming novelty dance to the third act.

“ Camille” is having a six-nights’ run at
Melbourne Princess’s, with Vera Remee as
the consumptive Flossie and George Cross as
her doting boy. Miss Remee is not parti-
cularly comfortable. Some of the moods of
the character are beyond the lady’s little
gallery of mechanical emotions, while her
voice is always rather metallic even in its
most wooing moments. As Armand, George
Cross is as tender and melting as may be,
and is about the only person in the piece who
employs a good clothes-builder to point a
fashion, and adorn a tale. Ronald Riley’s
Comte de Varville belongs to the languid
school of Doncherknow, and Ward Lyons, as
Duval, senior, is gruffly emphatic in present-
ing the old gent.’s point of view. Frank
Neil (Gaston) and Maurice Nodin (Gustav)
are more convincing in a small way than
Miss Robertson (Nannie) and Miss Bow-
man (Madame Prudence), whereof the last-

fully to get the garrulous old lady into the

At Melb. Royal there will be no Easter
change of bill. “Seven Keys to Baldpate”
is only in its third week, so Niblo will go
on with his story of the amazing spoof that
spoofs himself and the audience.
* * * *
Melb. King’s is to be reopened next Satur-
day by a syndicate described as Bill Adams,
Ltd., and the enterprising Alf Lumsden will
duly present his “Bill” in farcical-comedy
form. A new Australian comedy from a
comparative novice in stagecraft, suggested
by the late Snazelle’s somewhat-forgotten
yarn of Bill Adams, the Hero of Waterloo,
is, anyhow, a plucky experiment. But the
King’s is the home of plucky experiments,
successful and otherwise, and public curi-
osity will give “Bill Adams” a fair chance
to make good. Lumsden has secured a strong
eo.—Herbert Ford, Charles Brown (in the
name part), Harry Paulton, jun., Maggie
Knight, Ethel Buckley and three others.

The second edition of The Follies, which
consists partly of the first edition over again,
and includes a fairly bright travesty of
“Bought and Paid For,” continues to be the
backbone of Melb. Tivoli programme. James
J. Corbett now tells his gentle anecdotes of
his stoushing days in the first part, and
Smith and Nielson, with a vaudeville turn,
are the latest arrivals. Also, Miss Clerc, the
toe-dancer, who arrived a week earlier, is
still there.

At the Auditorium the Royal Strollers
have caught on, as was expected. On Saturday
they changed their songs and dances, but the
first part concluded as before with Sydney
James’s ventriloquial manipulation—if the
term is permissible—of Little Billy, the
bloke who appears almost human in all
respects save his revolving neck and trucu-
lent smile. The new burlesque, in succession
to “Faust,” is “Our Picture Palace,” which
terminates to the strains of Gor’save.

Advts.. of . “The Naval War” which Arthur
Russell is introducing to Melbourne notice
at the Auditorium next Saturday lay stress
upon the fact that it is not a cinematograph
show or a panorama or any old thing of a
kindred character. A scenic background,
painted by Grist, is the only fixed portion
of the outfit; for the rest, the “millions of
gallons” of water are subject to least move-
ment. “The Naval War” is a matter of model
battleships, mimic forts and spectacular dis-
turbances that will soon make a loud and
prosperous noise outside, as well as inside,
the building when the novelty comes to light.

The Robert Parker concerts at Melb. Town
Hall, beginning on Easter Saturday, are to
be supported by Mrs. Carmen Harris, whose
mezzo-soprano has been uplifted in opera
abroad since Melbourne last heard it, and
Miss Scapine, a young violinist. Parker
himself is well remembered as the tall and
tuneful basso of the visiting Quinlan opera
companies, and the soul of the musical world
awaits his coming.

grand-opera conductor.
At Melbourne Bijou the Stanley McKay
Panto. Co. is now leading a moderately fes-
tive existence in the home-made extrava-
gance, “Old Mother Hubbard.” Miss Essie
Jennings endows the part of principal boy
with considerable shapeliness and a small,
sweet voicewhile the only other notable
entertainer is the drily humorous James
Gerald in the role of Pansy Hubbard. In
the first part of the bill, Tom Lesso is re-
appearing in a fresh juggling act, and Arm-
strong and Howarth, sketch artists, have
broken out in another rash experiment
entitled “A Foolish Fool.”
AT POVERTY POINT.
“Masetto”: Otto Sobell, the vocal expert
who, according to Marshall Hall, is going
to do big things at Melb. Conservatorium,
is ostensibly an importation from the Cold
Country. He certainly lived there for some
years, but Adelaide held his people 30 years
back, his father being its best-known ama-
teur, Otto Fischer. A sister—Minna—-mar-
ried actor Herbert Flemming, and on
his death went before the registrar with
G. H. Clutsam, the song-writer, who now
lives in London.
“THE STROLLERS.”
A musical director in Stroller Land.
“Pinafore” is funnier than it ever was.
The satirical song of the patriot sailor, who
might have been a Rooshun, etc.-, but re-
mained an Englishman, is taken quite
seriously by its Melbourne audience, which
overlooks the joke and gives the song a
treble encore. Probably the audience would
give 10 encores to the Rule Britannia tab-
leau which used to cap the absurdity of
the pirates of Penzance laying down
their cutlasses and pistols when the ser-
geant of police bids them surrender in the
name of their Gracious Sovereign; but the
tableau is omitted in the performance of the
latest Gil.-Sul. Co. Quite a lot of people
took it seriously even in the old days. The
question is: How many of Gilbert’s satires
and ironies do they not take seriously?
“Hamer”: There are rumblings of a com-
ing earthquake in the theatres. The big
city managements, with one or two excep-
tions, have always been hostile to the
unions. In fact, they and their friends
smashed the Actors’ Union, and founded in
its place an association with objects that
are not unionistic. The prospects of also
smashing such unions as the Musicians’ and
Theatrical Employees’ are remote; never-
theless the fight goes on, and the recent can-
cellation of the State registration of the
former union was followed by an attempt
to form a new musicians’ union. It was,
in fact, mentioned that the union had been
formed, and intended to apply for regis-
tration ; but as only a dozen musicians have
shown any interest in it (five of them as
watch-dogs on behalf of the established
union) its prospects, like those of the Crown
Prince of Sausagedom, are not bright. The
allegation has been made that one firm was
willing to finance the new organisation and
help it on its way. As a result, there has
been much friction, many unmusical trade
unions declaring that if the theatre man-
agements want fight they can have a whole
cargo of it. These are not the brightest of
iu?n S tbe show business, and the Trades
Liall potentates reckon that the withdrawal
ot a large percentage of patronage from
h (>s ti hi in an <i ge m cuts and its transfer to
those theatres which display no hostility to
the unions would be a mighty argument.
A MIXED VIEW OF THE WAR
IN SOUTH AUSTRALIA.
“Screen’’: Two new picture theatres are
on the point of opening in Bourke-street,
Melbourne—Hoyt’s and the Victoria. They
challenge each other for size and beauty,
although neither has quite the sumptuous
decoration that Williams bestowed on the
Melba and the next-door Britannia. St.
George’s Hall has disappeared in Hoyt’s new
“palace,” which even towers above the
Theatre Royal adjoining. The Victoria re-
places Parer’s Restaurant, but the liquor
license is kept alive in a small way, which
gives it rather a pull over other “movies.”
The only other picture house with a liquor
license is the unlucky National Amphi-
theatre, built by Brennan and Co., at the
east end of Bourke-street. It is occupied
at present by Hoyt; and other picture people
will succeed him there, without brilliant
hopes. The Victoria will be conducted by
Ihe former lessee of the Star Pictures, at
the Waxworks; but the Star will go on
under new management. Thus Bourke-
street, in a week or so, will have seven big
picture shows every night—the Gaiety,
Melba, Britannia, Hoyt’s, Victoria, Star and
National. Can Bourke-street stand it? And
can the picture supply stand it? Already
the associated houses are not able to
keep to their rule of complete difference in
every place.
From London: Passed out, at 43, Louis
Meyer Moniat —known as Louis Meyer—
artist and journalist turned theatrical man-
ager. It is only five years ago that he began
speculating in plays. His one big prize,
“The Glad Eye,” was an adaptation of a
French farce. Arthur Bourchier had
acquired the English rights, but afterwards,
losing faith in it, sold the thing to Louis
Meyer for a trifle. Meyer gave it a trial
trip in the provinces with poor results, and
came to the conclusion that Bourchier was
right. A friend, however, prevailed upon
him to give it a chance in London. It
caught on immediately, was attacked by the
wowsers, and ran for a year. A native of
Birmingham, Meyer came up to London
early, began press work, became one of the
proprietors of London Opinion, and after
his acquisition of “The Glad Eye” money-
spinner, went in for horse-racing and other
extravagant and exciting recreations, which
played the deuce with his never xobust
health, and the end came that way.
“0.K.”: Faulkner Smith in Melbourne
is running a series of monthly “national”
concerts, which began, of course, with an
all-Irish entertainment. The next will be
all-Scotch, and then Wales will get a look
in, presumably. After which the platform
will be clear for an Anglo-Belgian or Franco-
Russian concert. The word “national” in
concert business hereabout rarely is asso-
ciated with the word “English,” and never
with “Australian.” What’s the good of foist-
ing upon this country the sort of “nation-
alism” expressed in ballads of dead and gone
racial animosities, such as “Scots Wha Hae”
or “Blue Bonnets over the Border”?
“Sketch” (from London) : Carrie Haase,
who had one of the longest parts in “The
Dynasts” at the Kingsway Theatre, is tak-
ing a holiday after being about 10 years
away from Australia, and leaves for the
other side shortly. She was the original
Anne in the provincial tour of Shaw’s “Man
and Superman,” and as an understudy got
her first chance when she acted Julia Nielson
roles in London.
Beaumont Smith has written a Maori
play which he threatens to try on the in-
habitants shortly per medium of his co. at
present in the Islands playing “The Glad
Eye,” etc. Incidentally, he has announced
the name of the children’s play which he
recently bought from Arthur Adams—(long
breath here) —“Snookey-Ookums.”
From Lincoln Springfield, editor of Lon-
don Opinion :
“J.F.H.’’ (B. 24/12/’l4) states that Mark Ham-
bourg has got £5OO damages from us for calling
him a German. Permit me to put you wise. It
was not London Opinion, but a deadly rival, of not
half our excellence, which trod in this particular
puddle. As I have been in the habit of meeting
Mark at the Club poker table, I was well informed
about his Russian birth, his British enthusiasms,
and his Satanic luck; and the moral that seems to
stick out here is the advisability of editors playing
poker as often as possible.
Novelist H. G. Wells, a recent recruit to
Protection, makes confession :
The writer is a Liberal and a Socialist, and thus
far has done his best to oppose tariff reform. He
has no fanatical belief in Freetrade. No Socialist
has. Since all Socialists believe in the fullest assist-
ance and control of industry by the State, it’would
be absurd for them to repudiate the idea of con-
trolling exports and imports.... I am certain that
in the new view of the need of Protection, I do not
think alone. A situation has arisen in which the
almost immediate adoption of Protection is essential
to our national security..
Heine knew his countrymen and saw a
long way, but not far enough. He wrote
To a certain degree Christianity softened the
brutal battle-ardor of the Germans. Yet it did not
destroy the instinct; and when the Cross, the talis-
man that holds it in check, is broken there will be
a new eruption of ferocity. Then Thor will come
forth with his gigantic hammer and smash the Gothic
cathedrals into ruins.
But Thor is not content merely with
smashing cathedrals. He is raining his
blows on the farms and homes of people
whose country he undertook to protect.
He is burning libraries, looting the
homes of niillionaire and workman alike,
bombarding nursemaids and babies, dropping
bombs on old-age pensioners, and trying to
blow up hospital-ships. Men are not im-
pelled to this sort of thing by ardor of
battle. The motive force is just the plain
devilishness of the ape.
“Form Fours” : There is a lot of patriot-
ism running to waste just now. One recent
dark night our platoon (grand old word
“platoon”!) of grave suburban rifle-club-
men, mostly stiff in the joints and rotund
in the middle, listened to a drill instructor
while he explained the best way to dodge
shrapnel when hotly charging a position.
There wasn’t one of the whole lot of us who
didn’t know quite well that it was all pure
guff; yet there wasn’t a ripple on the face of
any of the 50 humbugs. What we really did
need was a hint or two on how to advance
on wasteful State Governments that continue
to fire away borrowed cash as if there were
no shortage of golden ammunition. If the
“Home Guard” would storm Holman’s
treasury and lock up the book of blank
P.N.’s, it would be doing good work that
lies ready to its hand.
“Huffin Guilin”: Re Geo. Newman, of
Blenheim (M.L.), and codching records. (B.
18/3/T5). “Jimmy” Lyall drove Cobb and
Co.’s big coach between Hamilton and
Harrow (Vie.). 60 miles, six days a week,
from 1872 to 1896, or thereabouts —450,000
miles in all. Then he started on his own
account, and has been driving his teams
in Western Vic. ever since. His son, “young
Jimmy,” has helped to tot up the fam-,
ily’s mileage, which is now well over
1,000,000,' and going strong.
From the ruins of a motor-car which
bounded off the road near Manly (Sydney)
on Sunday, George Redmond, news editor
of Sydney Sun, was borne away dead, and
“Snowy” Baker, director of the many Sta-
diums, was carried, badly battered, to the
nearest hospital for inspection and repair.
Redmond, a Melbourne University man, moved
to Sydney about three years ago from the
Argus. His tragic passing at 37 years of
age will be deplored by a very wide circle
of friends.
The most interesting veteran at the recent
Melbourne gathering of veterans was not
the old lady of 93 from Sale, nor Mrs. Glad-
stone (86), who sang a “Hunting Song,”
but Carr Boyd, the tough old bushman who
in the early UO’s followed the track of
Burke and Wills. The still-ebullient old
—“Potjostler” of scores of ancient
Bulletin pars.—got the most excited when
talking about the Victoria Desert. “Desert!”
he snorted. “Desert! Why, it’s a lovelv
land, where even the niggers get fat and
sleek and long-haired.”
“Hamer”: The principle of One Big
Union is being strenuously preached by the
Sydney Worker, which is an indication that
the A.W.U. is intent upon bringing the
thing about. Already many minor unions
have sought amalgamation with the big fel-
low and have been eagerly admitted, and if
it announced that it was open to all-comers
it would no doubt rope in thousands who
already are members of other societies. But
it shows no desire to make a quarrel that
way with the different craft unions, its
desire, being to get the members of each
organisation to come over as a body. The
chief hostility comes from the officials of
the smaller concerns, who don’t like the risk
of losing their small glories and, in some
cases, emoluments. The vice-president of
the Tinkers’ Union, for instance, would de- ■
fend his title with his wife’s blood. It is
his one distinction, and as long as he holds
it he has a vague hope of reaching the
Upper House. He may howl against heredi-
tary titles and knighthoods as meaningless
things, but his own vice-presidency is quite
a different proposition. For all that, the
way union after union, at one time un-
friendly to the idea, have sought for amal-
gamation, shows that the One Big Union
idea is growing, and the days of small
organisations appear to be numbered.
AN OLD AIR.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
What summer night do you recall to me?
What memories—what tears?
Was it that voyage across a moonlit sea ?
Each note an old wound sears.
What friend now lost to me was near when you
Called to my heart “Awake! ”
And wove a thread of sound the minutes through
That Death alone can break ?
Strange is the magic of old haunting airs
With minstrel-cunning wrought
That send a fairy-call through Life’s affairs,
To wake the sleeping thought.
Veiled figures throng and beckon in my dream ;
Dear eyes look into mine,
While I, bewildered, watch the passing stream
With misty eyes a-shine.
It rends my heart. Yet I am ever loath
To let the music cease.
Honey it brings and wormwood ; they are both
Blended in draughts of peace.
What joy to listen on Thoughts’ borderland
To echoes sweet and far !
To trace old footprints dimly in the sand,
And see again Love’s star!
Somewhere between To-day and Long Ago
Are dreams I cannot share,
Nor find, till to my heart, insistent, low,
Steals some belovGd air.

“CALIFORNIA SYRUP OF FIGS.
Harmless “fruit” laxative cleanses
stomach, liver and bowels without
griping or discomfort.
An acid stomach, clogged with fermenting,
ill-digested food, means that the liver is not
doing its duty. Nature provided ripe fruit
juices to keep the liver up to its work.
“California Syrup of Figs” is a deliciously
refreshing fruit laxative which is always in
season. You can keep it at hand, and it
will be an unfailing friend whenever the
tongue is coated, bowels sluggish, breath
foul, throat dry or sore, stomach full of
wind, and head hot and aching. You can
take a dose whenever it is needed, a,s safely
as you could eat fresh fruit. In a short
while you will feel the benefit. The bowels
will be gently relieved, and the stomach
cleansed and sweetened as the undigested
food is moved on and got rid of. The tongue
will grow clean again and the head will be
cooled and cleared. There is no mistaking
the beneficial effects of “California Syrup
of Figs.” Directions are with it for adults
and children of all ages. This pleasant
laxative is good for all, and cannot possibly
harm even the most delicate, but you must
ask for “California Syrup of Figs,” and look
for the name and trade mark of the Cali-
fornia Fig Syrup Co. All leading chemists
sell “California Syrup of Figs.” 1/li and
1/9 per bottle.
SOCIETY
The long argument between employers and
employed on the question of day baking in
Sydney has ended at last in favor of that
plan. There have been about a dozen
threats of strike and a score of conferences
over the matter; and some time ago a
shandy-gaff agreement was fixed up under
which work was to commence at 2 p.m.
After trying this for a while, the master
bakers declared that the name of the day-
baking idea was dough. The men still said
it was cake, and wanted more of it. Now
the employers have agreed to 10 a.m. as
starting-time, which means real day baking;
so the controversy ends, for the present at
any rate.
THE MEDICAL BAPTISM.
JACKY (to vaccinating doctor): “You christ'n this pfella, no catchit smallpox, eh?"
Echoes of the big waterside strike that hit
Maoriland in the exports a year ago still
rumble round Auckland province. One echo
is about the bill. When trouble started
Massey consulted the Farmers’ Union, and
the Auckland branch thereof scoured the
Waikato turnip paddocks and byres for
special constables, who were to be delivered
in the city freight paid. City members of the
union who farm in ledgers and depasture on
cash-books undertook to supply the needed
pieces of 4x 2 ironbark to bash the wharf-
lumper with, and patriotic merchants under-
took in a spasm of recklessness to “pay the
bill” when the bashing was over. So at
much expense the country hurled forward
regiments of mounted farmers, who joyously
ran up gigantic bills for horse-feed, trans-
portation, badges, beer and getting their
whiskers cut. When the disturbance ended
Massey was approached with the bill, but
replied with a horrible silence. As the mer-
chants couldn’t find their memory, and had
grown deaf in both ears, the farmers’ union
woke up in the soup, and after long immer-
sion whispered from the tureen to the raging
creditors that the country centres would pay.
So the country centres got bills in cartloads ;
but still there’s nothing doing, and the
anguished shopkeepers are saying most un-
kind things about farmers’ unions. Also,
many farmers who lent horses to the special
constables have never seen the nags again,
and are beginning to go sour on the organisa-
tion. Altogether, it seems to be one thing to
settle a strike with biff and another thing to
pay the bill.
* * * *
The murder of the old grazier Escott at
Black Springs (S.A.) had features which
stirred Adelaide to its boots. One of the
first items of intelligence sent in was that
Escott had been slain while reading his
prayer-book. This was given great promi-
nence in the evening editions; and the morn-
ing dailies, scenting possibilities, rose mag-
nificently to the occasion. Special reporters
were mobilised, photographers thrown into
the firing-line, process-engravers called on to
do their worst. The ’Tiser burst out on the
second day with a page of pictures—there
was a plan of the ground floor at the home-
stead ; here was the place where the victim
fell; that smudge near by was the actual
bloodstain. And to round off the picture of
gore there was a nice illustration of the
window through which the murderer fired,
and the hole made by the bullet. So far, all
was shuddersome and delicious. But the pic-
ture of the well down which it was supposed
the miscreant threw his gun was a dismal
failure. Still, even a Yankee fliekergraph
couldn’t make much of a success of a deep,
dark well; so there’s no reason for the Bony-
thons to feel downhearted.
EMPLOYING THE MENAGERIE.
The Germans have mobilised the elephants from Hagenbeck’s menagerie at Hamburg to clear the roads
in the Valenciennes district. — Cable.
MENAGERIE KEEPER (innocently): "Having enlisted the elephants, your Majesty, we
might also employ the lion and the bear."
KAISER: “Ach, Himmel! Vos you dare pull my leg?"
Knibbs has a new table showing the but-
cher’s bill for last year. Australia had 159
fatal industrial accidents and 4912 suffi-
ciently severe to cause disablement for more
than 14 days, as against 185 and 5030 re-
spectively in the previous year.' N. S.
Wales had 61 of the fatal and 3238 of the
less serious accidents, the cause of Ma’s
remarkable affluence in the matter being the
prevalence of the mining, especially the coal-
mining, industry. Throughout Australia 112
of the fatalities and 3937 non-fatal serious
accidents occurred in and about mines, the
biggest toll being easily secured by the coal
business. No managing directors were
killed, or maimed, or bruised. Taking other
industries, it appears that no bookmakers
were smashed up while going to work, money-
lending was carried on with immunity from
disaster, and not a single bishop was killed
while earning his meagre daily repast.
“Dl” condoles with the Chief Sisyphus of
N.S.W.: —-
The new Chief Secretary is bent on the metamor-
phosis of Sydney. There is to be no more loitering;
no more crowding round shop windows; pedestrians
are to keep to the right—Elysium is to be laid at
the city’s feet. The citizens would feel gladder if
they had not heard such things a dozen times
before. There was a determined move once to ex-
tirpate the shop tout. It is still impossible to walk
in certain parts without being grabbed by an in-
sanitary-looking waster and implored to buy a slop
suit. Spitting on the pavements was to be checked.
Everyone spits who feels like it, and the Law
never objects. During the fashionable spitting
hours (the lunch recess and the time when the
shops close) the outsides of many city pubs are a
fair imitation of the Mazurian Lakes. The pavement
in one part of Pitt-street is the assignation place
for the city’s youth and beauty. Lovely women and
gallant men stand there by the hour, and the mere
passer-by has to fight his way through or use the
motor-infested gutter. Yet there was a time, long
passed, when this crowd was told definitely by the
police that it was Doomed. The truth is, no absurd
or evil practice is ever doomed in Sydney. For one
thing, there are too many of them. If a Chief
Secretary, hungry for reform, confined himself to
one lonely objective—say, to persuading the City
Council to keep the streets more or less sanitary—
he might hope to achieve something. He wouldn’t
succeed, of course; but at least he might hope.
Justice Gordon (N.S.W.), sitting in
Divorce, told a witness last week that all
persons, excepting the King, could be called
upon to tell all they knew about a matter
before any Court, unless it could be clearly
shown that to do so would put the witness
in peril. The witness before Gordon, J., had
been called by a husband who was petition-
ing for release from his marriage contract.
She, on the ground that he had made dis-
orderly proposals to her in her house, refused
to support his case. His Honor committed
the lady to the charge of the sheriff as a
preliminary and adjourned the Court for
half an hour so that she might consider the
position. At the end of the interval
she gave in. It wasn’t possible for her
to repeat the classic performance of the
man charged with murder who got off by
marrying the Crown’s chief and only definite
witness. Which, by the way, recalls that
his Honor apparently forgot that exception.
A wife isn’t bound to tell all she knows
about her husband, and a husband isn’t
bound to tell even half of what he knows
about his wife.
When Germany got to know about the
doings of the N. S. Wales Unnecessary
Commodities Committee it was most
annoyed. The following is a clipping from
the Frankfurt Bltjtwurst :
God punish England! Amongst the many savage
races she has bought with her money to fight us, are
the people of New South Wales, in the Continent of
Australia. She paid these people £18,000,000, dis-
tributed amongst several “States” or tribes; and,
there being no money in the country, the bribe was
readily accepted. The manner of people that these
Allies of Britain are (God punish her!) may be
gathered from the doings of a committee formed by
the white officials for the protection of the natives
by the regulation of the price of necessities, which
(owing to our successful blockade of British ports,
and the fact that this savage country depends for
nearly all its manufactured goods on imports) are
scarce. The committee has decided that news-
papers are not a necessary commodity (as of course
they are not in such a country), and that the price
of soan needs no regulation; but beer and spirits
were amongst the first things that were declared neces-
sary, prices being fixed for all the drinks of the
country. It is savages of this sort that the British
would hurl against us in their efforts to destroy
German kultur!

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The annual row between the Anglican Archbishop
of Sydney and the Agricultural Society about open-
ing the Show on Good Friday is in progress.
The years reel by like telegraph-posts,
And ev’ry day is the same to me ;
They’re all alike as a herd of ghosts ;
New calendars shed their > leaves with glee ;
Life’s merry-go-round whirls fast and free;
Submissively to the draught I bow.
I never can tell where I should be
Until I come to the Easter Cow.
The Bishop and she are ancient foes ;
Each year the battle is joined anew
He fronts her bravely in sacred hose,
And fights the fight of the stuffy pew ;
His words are many, his vict’ries few ;
The cow is brave as a cow can be;
He only gets in a fearful stew;
But both of them tell the time to me.
Another year to the Past has flashed;
Another post to the rear has fled ;
So many more bright hopes are dashed ;
So much more grey in my nodding head—
The time is coming when I’ll be dead.
llovv many more years will Fate allow?
We’re one lap nearer our earthen bed—
The Bishop’s clinched with the Easter Cow!

A scholarly Englishman sends his philo-

the coast of Britain :
We old people are living in a kind of nightmare
—a nightmare of submarines and aircraft. The
young people take it easily enough, and the way
the male youth has risen to the occasion is certainly
amazing. But I wish to God it had come after my time.
It is the last war in the old style; in fact, I doubt
whether war as we understand it will be even possi-
ble 20 years hence. Suppose a thousand or so air-
craft over London or Berlin at once. No constitu-
tion could stand it —as the old farmer said of Hell.
After all the talk about the wonders of
Modern Warfare on land and sea, it is re-
freshing to hear from an elderly observer who
thinks of this war as a comparatively old-
fashioned foolishness which will be reduced
to insignificance by the aerial hostilities of
the future.

“Billy Blue”: The S. M. Herald has
been repeating the oft-repeated old mistake
that the vine was first introduced into Aus-
tralia in the year 1815 or later, and it adds
that the point has been thoroughly investi-
gated by painstaking searchers. It may
assist the Herald’s painstaking searchers to
know that the historian Collins, who arrived
here with the first fleet, tells us that by
January 30, 1788, some ground having been
prepared near his Excellency’s house, the
plants from Rio Janeiro and the Cape of
Good Hope were safely brought on shore,
and the new settlers had the satisfaction of
seeing the grape and fig take root and
establish themselves in the new world.
They must have done well, too, for there is
on record a letter from Mrs. John McArthur,
dated March 18, 1791, in which she says:
“The grape thrives remarkably well. The
Governor sent me some bunches this season
as fine as any I ever tasted.” Then we have
one of Governor Phillip’s last despatches,
dated October 16, 1792, reporting that he
had three acres of a vineyard at the Govern-
ment House grounds at Parramatta, and
that Philip Schaffer, a free settler, had
planted out a vineyard of one acre. Schaffer
had a grant of 140 acres on the north bank
of the Parramatta River, now Subiaco. This
property was known as “The Vineyard” till
the late ’3o’s. Schaffer came as a superin-
tendent of convicts; he was an agriculturist
from Hesse, but could - not speak English,
so on March 30, 1791, lie was granted the
above-mentioned land, and became the
first vigneron of Australia. Governor
King reported, on August 7, 1803, that
he had 30 acres at Castle Hill ready to plant
and later that he had about 12,000 vines in
the first and second years’ growth.
The coming referendum in South Aus. as
to closing all bars at 11, as at present, or at
six, or any hour between that may get a
majority, has brought out a neat pictorial
joke. Adelaide hoardings are all familiar
with the whisky poster of the Scotch guest
who turns liis head away while the host,
pouring from bottle to glass, says des-
perately, “Say when, mon!” The remark
was too appropriate to local conditions to
be missed, and now an addition to the
“legend” makes the picture i-eply “Eleven
o’clock, please.”
Dear Bulletin, —Is there any chance of
getting the scalps of the idiots responsible
for the misleading finger-boards on the Blue
Mountain paths and by-ways? Out of 72
direction boards met with recently, 3S must
have been put up by a dipsomaniac who
knew absolutely nothing about the localities.
My mates and I have been out four times
THE WORRYING ROWER OF MONEY.
"What's worrying you?"
“Money?”
"But you told me just now you had got
scarcely any.”
"Well, it don't take a million to worry you ,
does it?”
this year searching for people who’ve been
‘bushed” and benighted through these in-
fernal boards, and the life of the local police-
men is a nightmare. Scarcely a week
passes without one or more of them having
to turn. out by night and go scrambling
down cliffs and gorges looking for missing
strangers. Sometimes guide-boards nailed
to trees are knocked or blown down, and the
passing bumpkin or practical joker puts
them up again—pointing anyhow. Again,
the tree may “screw” after a board has been
nailed to it. If these boards were bolted to
posts there would be less wear and tear in a
holiday on the Mountains.—Yours bad-
temperedly, Rodriguez’s Pass.

“Chudah”: The Turk throws away not
only Constantinople, but also Palestine.
What then? Many a zealous Zionist has
visions of Palestine as a neutral independent
state, in which the Jews, with fair play to
all, would gradually become the most influ-
ential, even in point of numbers. The
Egyptian Gazette, voicing this aspiration,
writes that the Zionists have now their
grand opportunity. But they will never
carry out the ridiculous project of the ex-
tremists, to squeeze all the Jews back. For
one thing, Palestine wouldn’t hold them.
Hirsch founded the Colonisation Society with
10 millions sterling capital. Palestine was
the chief, but not the exclusive, aim; for
lamdies have been transplanted from East-
ern Europe to Argentina and elsewhere
However, the movement has done more for
1 amstine than any other place. There were
only 4000 Jews in Jerusalem in 1841 • now
7^oo0 ar< T <!o ’n°T, V 1 a total Population of
70,000. In all Palestine there are 150,000
inn nnn uarter of the whole. Of these
100,000 have come from Europe since 1887.
All Jewry would relish the Palestine focus:
yet_ some nervous Christians doubt whether
their holy places would be as safe with the
Hebrew as with the contemptuous Turk,
who says; ‘You can have your little bit of
nonsense _■ —as long as it doesn’t get in the
way of his own thefts.
“J.E.N.”: Excerpts which ought to be
found in the diary of any Hun in the
trenches:—
It’s a long lane that isn’t burning.
All’s fair in lust and war.
Bare the sword and spoil the child.
A crime in time saves nine.
Give a civilian a bad name and hang him.
You’ll never miss your courage till the cellar runs
dry.
The way to Calais is paved with broken bottles.
If at first you don’t succeed, lie, lie again.
“M.D.”: Re the
surplusage of mostiy-
idle youths employed
at certain municipal
bathing sheds (B.
ll/3/’35). One way
in which they could
advantageously be kept
busy, if the coun-
cils are determined
to support them, is
in sanitising the
place they are in. At
present in most of
these public baths, if
a bather spits, the de-
posit is allowed to
stay till it dries off.
Sometimes the bather
is healthy. Sometimes
he is consumptive, or
worse. It is all one
to the municipality.
The other day, as I
was dressing, I saw a
large and muscular
young man deposit
himself on the cement
at Bondi for sun-bak-
ing purposes. Simul-
taneously the back of
his head, his left
shoulder and one of
his feet connected
with three separate
masses of drying spu-
tum. Had he only
known it, he was en-
gaging in something
more hazardous than
warfare. All places
where people spit
should be constantly
hosed, and, if possible,
disinfected. There are
baths, sidewalks, bars
and other resorts where it would save
the State thousands yearly, if an army of
hosers and disinfecters were kept busy, at
the public expense, day and night.

“Hamer”: Shoplifting is pretty much a
habit nowadays, like betting on horses or
having afternoon-tea. And the difficulty in
dealing with the professionals with whom
the habit is a business is intensified by the
amateur efforts of some of the Yery Best.
So there is very little giving in charge. Most
shops (nearly all the big firms have private
detectives to watch for light-fingered cus-
tomers) are satisfied if they have the stolen
property returned. That in letting the thief
escape they are “compounding a felony”
seems to be generally overlooked. The mana-
ger of one big emporium who had hastily
given a customer in charge received a severe
shock the other day. He sent a representa-
tive to the court with a message that the
accused was the wife of one of the owners,
and he did not want to go on with the
charge. The indignant magistrate insisted
upon the manager attending the court, and
told him that, while he could not be forced
to give evidence on the charge he had laid,
it was_ competent for the police to proceed
on their own account and subpoena him as
a witness. There’s a harassed manager to-
day who would allow the boss’s wife to get
away with anything but the safe.

WHY WEDS THE WARRIOR?
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Melbourne clergymen admit an increase in wed-
dings. “Scores of young men who did not dream of
marrying a few months back have married after
being a few weeks in camp,” one clergyman says.
Curious persons are wondering why.
They wonder why our soldier Bill,
Who lately shied at Cupid,
Has knuckled down to Mistress Jill,
And lisped the fatal words, “I will!”
He once considered stupid.
What is there in this martial stress
That makes a man’s resistance less?
Is’t strict Obedience learned in camp
That helps him to be mated?
Or is it that the careless scamp
Whose morals were of vagrant stamp,
With courage stimulated
Assumes that, since he’s in for strife,
He may as well take on a wife?
He splices her some weeks before;
Then after brief love prattle,
He marches off to shed his gore,
And face the fiery stress of war,
The shriek and roar of battle.
Who wouldn’t wed as gay and breezy
When getting out of it so easy?
VICTORIA.

FATHER: “ How's it feel to dake a bath ,
Ikey?"
Ik EY: “Just a" zame as lasdt year, fader! ”
“Tridit”: In answer to “J.J.C.’s” (B.
4/3/’ 15) clamor for information as to the manu-
facture of a damper, let him know that the knack is
in the kneading. I’ll have to let it go at that, be-
cause the knack is not explainable. At a construction
camp on the Grafton-Casino (N.S.W.) railway the
argument on how to make a good damper raged furi-
ously for weeks. Finally a test was arranged. Two
men were handed a dishful of mixture and
kneaded it for exactly the same time, with as nearly
as possible the same motions. The dampers were
baked in the same fire for the same time. One turned
out a jim-dazzler; the other a fair strike-me-dead.
The method of kneading dampers differs with the
operator. Some use fingers only, others punch the
dough. One chap stirs it with a spoon till it is
nearly ready; another mixes it a little at a time.
But, like the good scone-constructor, the good damper-
engineer cannot tell how he arrives at his result.
“Jupp”: Talking of flies reminds me. I
was on the N.S.W. North Coast some time ago, and
the pest was so bad that a strange horse couldn’t
feed without being in agony. But the horses on
the spot have the strength of things. One day I
saw 40 running in a paddock. They split up into
groups of 20. Each group made itself into a circle,
each horse with head near the next one’s tail. Then
they started feeding, carefully swishing the flies
from each others’ heads at the same time. When
each horse had eaten all the grass within reach in
front of him and pulled the hairs of his neighboi s
tail through his teeth, two horses from the first
ring ran quickly oyer and made themselves a part of
the second ring. Thus each horse now had a new
spot in front of his face, and the feeding went on
afresh. When this gave out two more hopped over
from the smaller ring to the larger, and so it went
on. When only four horses were left in the little
ring, all hands went to another part of the paddock
and made up two fresh rings of 20 each, and then
proceeded as before. This they kept up till they
all had a feed. I didn’t stop to see what they did
afterwards.

“Yarram Yarram” : I butt in to put
“Boronia” wise about the “cobbler” fish. “Cobbler,
by the way, is a corruption. The correct name is
“cobra,” bestowed, I presume, on account of the
fish’s sting being likened unto that of the Indian
snake. In appearance the fish is very much like
the ordinary gurnet, but is greyish brown, with a
plentiful supply of stings or horns • as sharp as
needles, distributed over the body. The head alone
has six stinging points, the prick from any one of
which will cause great agony if not treated at once.
He may lurk about the shallows of an evening, as
“Boronia” was informed, but I am inclined to think
he does so only by way of a change. I have always
encountered him myself in comparatively deep water
and in daylight. It was in George’s Bay (E. Coast,
Tas.) that I first made the cobbler’s acquaintance.
He just pushed his card a couple of inches into the
meat below my thigh. I only escaped a few sleep-
less nights by enlarging the puncture to produce
profuse bleeding, afterwards bathing the wound in
salt water. This, I think, is the only antidote.
* * * *
“'i’igilans”: The fact that it will he thrown
into the dustbin doesn’t lessen the value of the
suggestion made by J. T. Beckett, Chief Inspector
of Aborigines (N.T.), that the northern Binghi
should be given military training. Beckett is abso-
lutely correct in his opinion,that the northern black
is the smartest hand with horses and cattle, and
deadly with a rifle. He’s
all that and more. Binghi’s
penetration and judgment
in emergency are as envi-
able as are his quick eye
and ear. The coastal
natives are born warriors
—big, powerful fellows,
capable of great endur-
ance. They are rarely
under sft. 10in., muscular
and well-built, especially
on the Adelaide and Alli-
gator Rivers, where food
is plentiful. There is a
strain of Malay blood in
their veins, which no doubt
accounts for their fighting
proclivities. A native in
these parts thinks nothing
of carrying a 501 b. bag of
flour or a 701 b. bag of
sugar a hundred miles or
so on his head. 1 have seen
a party of blacks, women
amongst them, carrying a
ton of flour in this manner.
The Territory natives do
not know their own
strength. They make fine
police troopers, and should
also make good soldiers.
The scheme should be to
train them for home de-
fence. What’s wrong with
a native army up north as
we find in Africa and
many other lands? It
could be recruited not
only from the Territory,
but from Queensland and
Kimberley also. There are
fine natives in West Kim-
berley—shearers, bullock-
drivers, pressers and rouse-
abouts. Some of the big-
gest natives in Australia
are found in the Leopold
ranges and along the nor’-
west coast. The De Grey
blacks are likewise splen-
did specimens. I have advocated utilising the blacks
for military purposes for some years, and the out-
spokenness of Beckett makes me hope that official-
dom will get sense one of these fine days.
“Mary McC.” : Town planners and others
who are enthusiastic about the improvement of our
suburbs suggest the abolition of the front-garden
fence. This is all very well; but as a first step in
the direction must come the abolition of the front-
garden cow. While people keep the family milk
wandering about in thei suburban street, the pickets
are a necessary safeguard. The cow business is
much overdone, and something drastic is required.
No matter how great the nuisance, you are not
allowed to shoot the animal, and your only redress
is to drive her to the pound. What I advocate is
registration of every piece of potential milk, and
the refusal of a license to any person who cannot
prove that he has enough grass to feed the proposi-
tion all the year round. In my own select suburb
there are people without an eighth of an acre of
back yard who pretend to keep a cow. Naturally
the public falls over the animal twice a week in
the darkness, and the rest ef the time she is con*
strueting butter-fat out of somebody’s cactus dahlias.
AN IMERESSIVE SITUATION
MISSUS: " No, I won't give you money, even if you are sick. But 1 will give you some
congenial work about the place.”
DERELICT: "Lor' bless yer, mum. I was a corset-maker before vie 'ealth broke down."
“Outcast”: The cocoanut crab is pretty
numerous in San Ohristoval (Solomons) and man-
ages to do a good deal of damage on the plantations.
Climbing the trees, he selects his nuts, pierces the
young ones through the eye and drinks the water.
The old nuts he husks with his powerful claws and
smashes them by bombing them .on to the ground.
The story goes that if the shell is broken smoothly,
the crab eats the flesh, but if the edges are
jagged the nut is left and another procured. The
natives tie grass round the tree the crab has climbed.
As it descends backwards, it appears to imagine
when it feels the herbage that it has reached the
ground and so loosens its hold and falls and breaks
its neck. Another native narrative is that • these
cocoanut crabs on moonlight nights hold dances. Two
of the largest and oldest crabs take up their positions
and beat time with their claws, while the rest of the
assembly circle round in a dance, waving their
claws as a nig. might wave his dancing club. This
I’ll vouch for, that the crabs do go down to bathe
on the beach on certain nights.

“Outcast” : “Machete,” writing on the Bird
of Death in Papua, leads me to an island in the
Banks Group, where a kind of divination is prac-
tised. A man who wants to learn the future repairs
to a certain place and takes note of the bird he
first sees. Owls and hawks are regarded as good
omens, but any red-crested or black birds are the
advance agents of death, the former betokening death
in battle, the latter death by illness. On the same
island the kingfisher is called “the bird of evil,” and
its special function is the carrying of bad news.
Should a kingfisher rest near a man it is a sure sign
of trouble, and it is customary to ask, “Is so and so
dead?” The bird replies by jerks of the head. No
one will kill a kingfisher on any account. All its
relatives might come along and wipe out a man’s
friends and leave nothing but his creditors.
“C.F.E.”: Is the betel nut any relation to
the betel leaf? In Ceylon, on tea and rubber
estates, where the labor is mostly Tamil with a few
Cingalese, a “chew” from the leaf is made thus:
A piece of areca nut, wrapped in a betel leaf, in
turn wrapped in a piece of tobacco leaf, is inserted
into the mouth. Then a dab of lime from a small
tin is licked off the forefinger. The expectoration
is red, the lime turning the juice of the betel leaf
to that color. The teeth, in time, become black.
The juice of the betel leaf acts as a stimulant,
enabling tea pluckers of all ages, from very small
girls to old women, to pluck steadily from 6 a.m.
till 5 p.m., without an interval for food. Has the
betel nut any other virtue than its intoxicating
power ?
“Billy T.”: Side by side with Edison
among the great inventors of the age we must range
my friend Henry Pryde. Pryde has invented many
things, including a non-combustible fuel for utilising
the waste at brickfields, and an electric motor for
winding watches, but undoubtedly his greatest inven-
tion is the Indelible Detective Motor Stamp. Henry
explained the whole scheme to me yesterday. The
Indelible Detective Motor Stamp is really a device
for identifying homicidal car drivers. “They’re
alius runnin’ people down ’n’ gettin’ away, L fer
leather,” said Henry Pryde, “but my indelible stamp
’ll fix ’em all right. The Gov’ment has on’y t’ make
it compulsory, then it’s attached to the tyres so, a
bump, brings it into play, and the tyre stamps the

The police picks up the body, finds my indelible
stamp on it —and there y’ are.” Pryde has several
times submitted himself to be run over by cars
fitted with his Indelible Detective Motor Stamp, and
produces certain indelible figures to establish his
claim. Figures, he says, cannot lie. Motor owners,
I understand, are not opposed to Henry’s device, but
some pedestrians he has mentioned it to are, he
complains, too dull to recognise its merits.
WET WEATHER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
When all the hills are swathed in mist
And even- hollow’s brimming o’er,
And tinkling rillets through the grass
Adown the slopes tumultuous pour ;
When trees are streaked with sombre lines
And. crystals tremble ’mid the leaves,
And jewels hang upon the threads
Of frosted film the. spider weaves —-
Ah, just to live! for life is fair
As clear, cool drops abundant spilled ;
As clear and pure as grassy cup
The silver-shedding skies have filled.
When the wet scrub breathes out a scent
To stif the blood in languid veins,
And the grey nimbus, drooping low,
Hangs ghost-like o’er the sodden plains ;
When rain flies glinting on the wind,
Nor ever bird or beast is seen,
But. all is fragrant solitude
Arrayed in ebony and green—
Ah! just to walk a lonely road
; , All in a scented, silent world !
To see the sparkling diamond-dust
On fragile petals half-unfurled !
When all the bush is dark and sweet
And filled with voices murmuring low,
Vague laughter mixed with soft complaint,
The waters whispering as they flow;
When puffs of foam with yellow tinged
Drift by the heads' of rushes tall,
Or quiver on the tawny flood
Below each chanting waterfall^-
Ah! just to dally with the wind!
To, hear, the, water splash and sing!
Life is a sweet, a keen, a gay,
A rarely precious, joyous thing!

Recipe to STOP DANDRUFF
This Home-made Mixture Stops Dandruff
and Falling Hair and Aids Its
Growth.
To a half-pint of water add
Bay Hum 1 oz.
Orlex Compound a small box
Glycerine 1 oz.
These are all simple ingredients that you
can buy from any chemist at very little cost,
and mix them yourself. Apply to the scalp
once a day for two weeks, then once every
other week until all the mixture is used. A
half-pint should be enough to rid the head of
dandruff and kill the dandruff germs. It
stops the hair from falling out, relieves itch-
ing and scalp diseases.
Although it is not a, dye it acts upon the
hair roots, and will darken streaked, faded,
grey hair in 10 or 15 cjays. It promotes the
growth of the hair and makes harsh hair soft
and glossy.* [5

“Eddyson”: It was McAdam, the circus
man, told me of the enterprise of Bartholomew Phinn,
of Drogheda, Bungaree. Phinn interviewed McAdam
in the travelling menagerie by the cage of big mon-
keys, and said he: “Yer the hid man iv the Zoo ye
have here, I’m told.” “I am,” said McAdam.
“Wan would know a great deal iv wild brutes iv the
field, ye are, are yeh?” “I know beef from a bull’s
foot,” said McAdam. “Come closer, will yeh now?
Whisper,” said Phinn—“have ye an ould lion t’ spare
ar all?” “I have not!” ejaculated the circus man.
“Nor an ould tiger?” “What the Devil would you be
doing with a tiger ?” “Anny ould wan would do.
'Tis no mather at all if ut’s wor-rn out par-rtly.”
“I haven’t an old beast in the menagerie.” “I’d not
think it onreasonable did yeh ask twinty-five shillin’
or twinty-seven-an’-six fer a lion, or a tiger, fer the
mather iv that, ve’d have no further use fer.” “There
isn’t a lion or a tiger here worth a penny less than
70 pounds.” Phinn gasped. “Sivinty pound!” he
said. “Man, but ut’s a sore heap iv money fer a
kind iv cat, so it is. ’N’ have yet nothin’ second-
hand, nothin’ in the way iv a rampagin’ wild baste
would howl in the night ’n’ terrify?” “I have a wolf
I’ll let you have for eight pounds.” McAdam pointed
out the wolf. “ ’Tis nothin’ but a poor, sick dog,”
said Bartholomew Phinn contemptuously. “I'm nadin’
a tirrible, great, desthructiff baste would carry off a
cow.” “Look here,” said McAdam, “what the deuce
is your little game?” “Whist, man. I’d not have
the wor-rld know iv ut! ’Tis a sacrit bechune me
’n’ mesilf, but I have the nate pub back on the timber
thrack t’ Danny’s Flat, ’n’ there’s nothin’ iv business
doin’. The dthrink I’m never sellin’ would be the
rooin iv me, ’n’ not a man rests in me house frim
Sathurday t’ Sathurday. Will yeh note the differ
wid Andy Clarke owns the Big Butt Hotil biyant be
the Spur-r, him doin’ the marv’liss shwift bar! ’n’
bottle thrade, ’n’ that overrun wid boarders he is
they’re shleepin’ hung t’ the roof iv the bar-rn in
string beds, ’n’ for whoi is all this but becaze he
have the Tantynooly Tiger visit his disthrict occa-
sional t’ advertise it far-r ’n’ wide, ’n’ bring the
shportsmin ’n' the sightseers frim all the cor-rners iv
the earth ez far ez Sydney! C’u’d I get holt iv an
ould lion cheap, lame ’r not, I’d lave him loose in
the thick timber adjacent t’ me house t’ roar be

doin’, the disthrict would be advertised over all the
big papers to Melbur-rne ’n’ Geelong ’n’ the fine

’n’ there’s no knowin’ I might sell me property fer
ez much ez six hunthred pounds befure the lion was
took.” McAdam grinned an unaccustomed width.
“You —; —• old fool,” said he. “You could do all
you want with a calf and a carriage rug.” “Would
the like iv that roar at all ?” said Phinn. “Get a
megaphone, man, and do your own roaring.” Phinn
looked McAdam closely in the eye for a full minute,
then turned on his heel, and left the circus. “Within
five weeks,” said McAdam, “the metropolitan papers
were telling hair-raising stories of the strange monster
in the bush at Danr.y’s Flat, and already I’ve sent a
customer on who’s thinking of giving six hundred
for Phinn’s hotel.” I was very grateful to McAdam
for his story. I had been preparing to go up and
have a pop at big game in Drogheda myself.
HE ALWAYS LUBRICATED.
“You say you were once an artist yourself?
Well, what did you go in for most, water
or oils?”
“Lor’ bless yer, sir, Hi never touched water
in me life.”
The Wages Board was holding sittings in
the country, and was lent a policeman new to the
business to swear the witnesses. He managed well
enough in the morning after the senior-constable had
primed him ; but during lunch-time he forgot some-
thing, and the first witness he swore after lunch had
the formula thrust at him this way: “Take the book
the evidence you give before this Board is the whole
truth an’ nothin’ but the truth, God strike yer!”
THE RULING HA BIT.
THREE-CARD EXPERT: “ Ere y’ are, mate, all profits. Try yer luck, an’ ’elp th'
stainin’ Belgians. ”
“Te Babarantiko”: If “Lonesome” (B.
4/3/’l5) means the Kingsmills he has never seen
there a single “canoe made of flakes of wood sewn .
together with human hair, capable of carrying 40 to
50 persons.” Such canoes no longer exist in the
group. Before the white man brought tools, canoes
up to 11 fathoms long were built. Slabs of titai
were laboriously chipped out and shaped with
tekatati-shell axes, and neatfy sewn together on to
the ribs, keel, stem and sternpieces with finest hand-
made coir string. Fleets of sailing canoes, built on
the same beautiful lines, are still used, but there are
certainly none over 30ft. long—unless they have been
built recently. The old, tedious method of building,
with a neat inset of folded strips of dead pan-
danus leaves to serve as caulking between the edges
of the pieces as they were sewn together, is falling
into disuse. Now, as a rule, four redwood boards,
12in. x lin., and usually 20ft. to 27ft. long, are bent
to the frame and fastened on with 2in. . galvanised
boat-nails. The modern craft, instead of keel, has
flat bottom. Old- or new-style canoes are rarely
over 2-Jft. wide amidships, and the carrying capacity
is slight. In the Marshall Group ocean-going canoes
as large as a small schooner, and carrying a pan-
danus-leaf hut amidships, are still built and used.

“Werrimee”: “Rag” (B. 4/.3/T5 ) revives
the old fallacy that snakes swallow their young.
He makes a further error in stating that “all forms
of lizards, snakes and amphibious-; saurians are egg-
lavers.” Nearly all Australian venomous snakes,
including water-snakes and sea-snakes, are viviparous.
Two exceptions are the brown snake (Diemenia
superciliosa) and the whip snake (D. reticulata).
The black snake produces about 20 live young ones
at a time, and the tiger and superb snakes over
30. The young ones do not require the care or
protection of the mother. They are able to look
after themselves from birth. Most of the harmless
snakes (as the blind snakes, fresh-water snakes, tree-
snakes, green and brown snakes, and the pythons)
are oviparous. The pythons (as the carpet and dia-
mond and the northern rock-snakes) incubate their
eggs, and are the only specimens known to do so.
The eggs (usually about 30) are stuck together in
the form of a pyramid, and the snake coils round and
round them, its head resting on top, the object being
to keep the egg-shells moist, as they would otherwise
shrivel. Some of the shink lizards are viviparous.
The single young of the shingle-back—a large lizard
common in the dry interior —is brought forth alive;
so also are the six to 15 young ones of the southern
blue-tongued lizard (Tiliqua nigrolutea).
“Force of Habit”: The boss had been
driving teams along the road for years, but he
bought a car last week and took us all for a drive
on Sunday. It was a scorcher, and he pulled up at
the first water-trough on the run.
“Billy Ballyooly” : I hear, on pretty good
authority, that there’s something of a drought at
present in the Riverina and thereabout. If there is,
I’m off to see what the country round Wyalong looks
like when it’s dry. The only time I ever saw it was
when I was driving a bullock-team. The cargo con-
sisted of one boiler. We had just had a spell of wet
weather, and all the mud in N.S.W. had been washed
on to the Wyalong-road. The rapidity with which
Bill of Berlin is getting to Calais is a circumstance
compared with our rush through that mud. In three
weeks we covered one hundred yards, and we only
knocked off digging trenches, swearing and belting
the bullocks when it got too dark to see what we
were saying.
“Lagani N.” : Every mountain stream that
I’ve happened on to in Papua has had splendid
speckled trout and catfish ready for the taking, and
the taking was this wise. A couple of boys, armed
with short spears, would dive into the pool and
frighten the fish out of it into the gravelly shallows,
where all the other boys would be waiting to pounce
on the prospective gorge. Some of the trout must
have weighed at least 101 b. After being gutted, they
were placed on a rack of green saplings, over a fire
to grill. When cooked the skin peels clean off, and
the snow-white glistening flesh can be shaken in two
luscious slabs from the bone. Fish not immediately
required are smoke-cured on the grid. Cassowary,
wallaby and pig are prepared for next month’s
tucker in the same way.
“Paddymelon”: Don’t let us miss the
chance of securing a good, technical education to
the coming generations of bullock-conductors. I
object to any ass rising up and saying that the
engineering of bullocks is a dying industry. So long
as we have cheap-labor fiscal-dodgers in power,
Stringy Bark and Greenhide will continue to be the
mainstay of the country. Let us, therefore, start a
fund for Roads Scholarships for bullockies, and send
’em to Turkey to pick up the “language” that will
be presently used by the natives there to the Ger-
mans. As the foundation for a good standard work
on advanced bullock driving I don’t think we are
ever likely to see it beaten.
“Mil” : Re “X.P.D.’s” potters of Port
Moresby (B. 25/l/’l5). The male doesn’t do any
pottery—that is woman’s work. “X.P.D.,” who saw
the bucks “lash sailing canoes together to make
gigantic rafts,” was looking at the lakatoi fleet
which has sailed its 600 miles to barter pots for
sago every season for a few hundreds years pro-
bably. Right back to the memory of the first white
man, anyhow,' freight of pottery westward to the
Gulf of Papua on the one monsoon; freight of sago
eastward on the other. Primitive ceremonies of fare-
well and placatory dancing go with the westward run
of the lakatois, which, clumsy as they look, can sail
close to the wind. The big mat sail, shaped like a
lobster’s claw, is full of beauty, too, seen against the
light.
“Fliuderino”: What’s all this fuss ner-
vous Westralians are making about bats? There’s
no need for it. If the beasts infest a house all the
occupier need do is to introduce an energetic snake,
if there is anything in the food line that a snake
likes better than a bat it is two bats. In Northern
Queensland, where bats breed like rabbits, some
people consider their humpy incomplete if it does
not include a carpet snake somewhere up in the
rafters. Once, at the Yarrabah Mission Station, I
was shown an eight-foot bat-catcher asleep on a
crossbeam in the big schoolhouse. But that was
the last I saw of him, as a few nights later a 1
couple of hungry binghis purloined him and roasted
him for supper. It was an irreparable loss-—or at
least would have been if there hadn’t been a million
or so other eight-footers in North Queensland.
“Outcast”: In Papua, by the -legend, tlie
crocodile has the power, through the wizard, of taking
on the shape of a young man or beautiful maiden,
and in parts of the New Hebrides this power is
assumed by a kind of sea snake. It is generally
seen in a dim light, when any young man returning
from fishing or the gardens is liable to glimpse an
attractive girl beckoning and alluring him. Brown
Brother is apt to be shredded with uncertainty.
There is a chance the maiden may be real flesh
and blood ; on the other hand, she may be the mae,
and if he yields to her invitation, he comes to a
bad and unduly sudden end. However, there are cer-
tain tests by which Lothario may find out the
character of his charmer. For instance, if her tongue
is a brilliant scarlet, or if her elbows and knees bend
ever so slightly the wrong way, she is a bad lot, and
should be passed with the utmost agility. Should a
nettle tree be at hand a mne will accept an invitation
to sit upon it. When you observe that she is not
being troubled about the sting, you let out a yell
and volplane for home. The possession of a croton
leaf is a sure spell for safety, which makes things
easier, for I don't suppose a chap can ask a prospec-
tive best girl to sit on a stinging tree in order to
make sure she is IT. She might be offended.
THE CHURCH TRIUMPHANT.
JOHN SMITH: “I serpose when the ' Uns
shelled your town they didn't per git ter
destroy the church?”
BELGIAN R EFUGEE: “No, M'sieu ', they
spared it."
J S MITH: “Wot! They did?”
BELGIAN REFUGEE: “ Yes, M'sieu’, they
thought it was ze brewery."
“Hare”: Damper; ingredients, plenty of
elbow grease, 21b. flour, 1 teaspoonful salt, 2 teaspoon-
fuls sugar, add water and knead for not less than a
half-hour, and as much longer as you like. The longer
you knead the better it will rise, and cook in fine
ashes after the fire has been burning all day. You
want to leave it in the ashes not less than an hour.
If you follow these instructions you will have some-
thing fit for the gods or other blokes who rouise.
Damper making to-day is a thing of yesterday.
HIS CRIME.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A tall, old man he is, and fine,
With quite a kingly bearing,
And like a soldier of the line
He passes, little caring
Though greeted oft with groans and hoots,
And sometimes cats and broken boots.
He’s done no one the smallest harm,
He’s clean and decent living;
His manner has an Old World charm ;
He’s generous in giving;
But neighbors eat the hens he owns,
And children follow him with stones.
What has he done? He's British bred,
No German-born exotic ;
The cornet tunes he plays in bed
Are truly patriotic ;
But that man has no sympathiser
Who wears his whiskers like the Kaiser.

A HOME REMEDY FOR DYSPEPSIA.
In view of the well-known fact that pro-
bably over 90 per cent, of all stomach
trouble, dyspepsia, indigestion, flatulence,
etc., is either directly or indirectly due to
acidity, or as it is commonly called “sour
stomach,” it is evident that correction and
prevention depend almost entirely on neutral-
ising the acid and stopping the fermentation.
For this purpose there is nothing better than
a half-teaspoonful of ordinary bisurated
magnesia in a little water immediately after
eating or whenever pain is felt. This imme-
diately neutralises the acid, stops the fer-
mentation, and permits the stomach to pro-
ceed with its work under normal conditions.
Owing to the widespread use of bisurated
magnesia by physicians and in the hospitals
and for greater convenience in carrying,
most chemists now supply it in the form of
compressed tablets, two of which are equiva-
lent to a half-teaspoonful of the ordinary
powder form. Care should be taken to get
bisurated magnesia, as other forms are lack-
ing in its peculiarly valuable properties.*

Alec Peacock, the cack’yng Premier of
Vic., was in his youth suggested as a candi-
date for the Church. Ballarat’s bishop of
those days tried very hard to make Alex-
ander James a clergyman; but Peacock’s
mother was against it, maiiJy because she
did not wish to give two sons, to the church.
The late Archdeacon Peacock, of Warrnam-
bool, was Alexander’s brother.
Tim Coghlan. the most readable Statis-
tician Australia ever produced, and for 10
years past Agent-General, is escaping from
that office after serving the Ma State in
one way and another for 42 years. In Lon-
don he has accumulated “large personal
interests,” and one of them, the big Marconi
enterprise, will for the future have most of
his attention.
Australia’s old friend Inclement Wragge
thinks he has settled down at last, and gives
his final address as Auckland (M.L.). Now-
adays he devotes his time to the cultivation
of an extensive tropical fruit garden.
Experiments in the growing of bananas,
pines (35 varieties),
and the host of tropic
fruits have been so
successful that the
garden is expected to
be one of the sights of
the North before long.

Major Frank Parker, a son of that Stephen
Parker, knight, who was once Chief Justice
of W.A., and himself a. barrister. He
served in the Transvaal disturbance under
Major Moor, and when that officer was killed
took command of the Westralian unit. The
unpleasantness over, he was for a time Reg-
istrar of the Criminal Court at Johannes-
burg, but returned to Perth, pursued Costs
and acted as Crown Prosecutor until the
bugles sounded in August. Meningitis
gripped him at 40, and made a widow and
orphaned a son.
Though Tim Coghlan is throwing up the
Agent-General’s job, N. S. Wales will still
keep his pot boiling. There is a pension of
£6OO a year coming to him.
Robert Dougan, who crossed the border
at Ash field (Sydney) last week, sailed from
the Ou'd Sod 64 years ago with a pick in
quest of a fortune at
Ballarat. He didn’t
find it, so rushed
away across the
Pacific towards the
Frazer River, sailing
in the barque Orestes
—“B nil y” Hayes
master. It was on
this trip that Hayes
put into Honolulu,
and the young Irish
digger saw a seaman
hoist in the rigging
the shirt which
brought on board an
armed party from the
warship Calypso. The
voyage was continued
with another master,
Hayes remaining be-
hind. The Frazer
proving a duffer,
Dougan doubled back
to Australia to become
an alderman and eventually a mayor in his
more helpless old age. He scored 82.
A human skull has been found, with tlie
remains of a saddle, in wild country between
the Burra (S.A.) and the Murray; and the
local Oldest Inhabitant suggests that the
fate of ; a once much-talked-of Captain
Arrara is cleared up at last. He came from
South America, nearly 60 years ago, with
mules for the Burra mine, got lost in the
scrub thereabouts, and was never heard of
again.
Governor Galway, of South Aus., is the
most unconventional sportsman that ever
dropped into a vice-regal seat, lie never
willingly misses a race-meeting. He golfs.
He gets up scratch cricket matches with
villages near his summer residence in the
hills. He goes round to all the suburban
bowling-greens and plays matches there too
—-to the great delight of an historic game
that hitherto has not had Government House
patronage in S. Aus. Also, entering for
two events in the recent S.A. tennis tourna-
ment, he proved to be a sound, old-fashioned,
defensive player, whose persistent lobbing
was proof against anything but hard volley-
ing. With Mulholland, his private secre-
tary, he got through two rounds of the
open doubles; and, with golfer Gunson,
pushed into the final of tlie Veterans, where,
however, he ran against Dr. Hone, a cham-
pion of years ago. with the inevitable result.
“S.” : I have met one German who utters
no complaint. He is a suburban shoemaker

that he was already nearly an old man. But
the “old man” came, 'and until quite lately—

doesn’t go a-field.

sity Conservatorium of Music. She has stated that for
the remainder of her stay in this country she will take
a personal interest in every student of singing at the
other Conservatorium, founded by Hall, and now directed
by Hart. Considering how she identified herself with
the moneyed Marshall Hall faction a few years ago,
Melba’s announcement looks very like an intimation
that her favor goes to the Albert-street school in
opposition to the University school where Hall is
now re-established. Perhaps it was his recent wild
and wobbling address on “Ideal and Real” that did
it; for therein the Prof, suggested strong Teutonic
leanings by referring to the sin of Potsdam
as the crime of all Europe: “European civili-
sation bears on its brow the shameful brand
of realism, and is not ashamed. And Europe
to-day is atoning her desertion of hope-
crowned idealism for the cold, cruel, pitiless creed
of the realist, by the wholesale slaughter of her
youth, the destruction of her precious monuments,”
etc. If Belgium and France had been more ideal-
istic, and even less prepared for war than they were,
would the Gerhogs not have come along to burn
their cities and commit atrocities on defenceless citi-
zens all the same ? Everybody save a musical pro-
fessor who got his education and prejudices from
Germany knows that no amount of idealism in the
rest of Europe could protect it against the militarism
which radiates from Potsdam. As a matter of fact,
it is for its long-continued neglect to suppress Pots-
damned realism by force that Europe is now atoning.
One can imagine Melba, the artistic woman of com-
mon-sense, reading Marshall Hall’s blather and ask-
ing: “What does he take us for?” And following
that up, she has promised to attend once a fortnight
at the Conservatorium where Hall doesn’t blather.
TO THE INFANT FRITZ.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Leaflets have been distributed in German schools
asking the children to bring the war to a successful
end by eating no cakes or sweets and very little
of other things, and by rebuking their parents if
they should eat wheaten bread instead of war bread
(mixed wheat and potato flour).
Gorge not yourself, my little friend,
With cakelets plain or plummy;
This war will all the sooner end
The less you stoke your tummy.
No doubt your gastronomic fires
Cry out for frequent feeding;
But kids who conquer such desires
Show patriotic breeding.
Examine father’s daily bread
And if you find it wheaten,
Heap curses on his swollen head
For every slice he’s eaten.
Collect the tiny crumbs that fall
And hoard them like a miser,
And write in charcoal on the wall:
“Ach Himmel! lloch der Kaiser!”
All kids or parents, thin or fat,
Should now be self-denying.
For lack of commissariat
The Belgian folk are dying;
Invading troops laid waste their land
With “thoroughness” quite Hunnisli,
And this is wliy, you understand,
Your Gott should England punish.
If father cannot go to war—
He would if he were younger —
Beseech him, Fritz, to eat no more,
But suffer pangs of hunger.
If you be game to knock off cake
And bread that’s fully wheaten
Dad ought to chance a tummy-ache
Till England be well beaten —■
To starve, in short, for duty’s sake
Till England be well beaten.
Beat England, Fritz, ach ! that’s the thing,
For she’s the wicked sinner ;
Your Hymn of Hate with fervor sing
Instead of taking dinner.
Should patriots be overfed
With meat, and pies, and jellies,
Whilst Belgians, wishing they were dead,
Have rats inside their bellies?
Abstain, my Fritz, from tarts and buns,
Small joy could they afford you;
And He who loves all little Huns
Will possibly reward you.
And if He doesn’t, blame Him not
Nor think He might be wiser ;
Bid father take his gun and “pot”
The Gott-forsaken Kaiser,
VICTORIA.

COLUMN
The Insurance Office of Australia,
Ltd. (Sydney), which was founded in 1910,
and began with a deficit of £5250 represent-
ing preliminary exes.:—■

The directors allege (though there is
nothing in the published accounts to sup-
port them) that “the whole of the loss was
incurred prior to the final confirmation of
the present Board’s appointment in May
last.” The new directors claim not merely
that they have had a better experience as to
claims, but that the expense rate has been
reduced from 58.3 p.c. of net premiums to
46.5 p.c., cutting the average down to 52.1
p.c. for the year. But 46.5 p.c. is still a
great deal too much, especially as this co.
passes on its re-assurances to an associated
office whose expense rate is very nearly as
high. It is quite true that there are one or
two first-class offices, like the Mercantile
Mutual, which show as much as from 45 p.c.
to 50 p.c.; but that is mainly the outcome of
a special selection of risks, with the result
that the Mercantile Mutual’s loss rate is
only from 23 p.c. to 35 p.c.—the actual limits
of recent years.
The fact is the principle on which the
1.0. A. was founded was all wrong. There
is only one way to economically launch an
insurance office, and that is by expanding
from one centre. A few men start a co.
with a small capital to do their own busi-
ness. Then they get their friends’ business;
and the circle goes on growing. That means
a low expense rate. When, however, a new
co. lobs in on a town where nobody ever
heard of it, it only gets business by buying
it. Or it gets business that has been turned
down by others, and up soar the claims. This
co. set out to cover Australia all at once.
Its figures show the result. No doubt in
some respects it has been handicapped. It
had two joint managers, and both of them—
well, let us merely say that they have gone.
But they weren’t fools, by any means. One
of them is as good a business-getter as there
is in Australia —perhaps as there ever was
in Australia. They had influential directors
also in Sydney and Melbourne. Unfortu-
nately, the two Boards couldn’t pull to-
gether. That, of course, is the almost-inevi-
table trouble with a new office which tries to
cover a continent all at once. The mana-
gers knew that the only chance of getting
a decent business in Melbourne was to get a
Melbourne Board with a strong pull. When
that was got, the directors there resented
the intrusion of Sydney directors who they
knew couldn’t command two-penn’orth of
business outside Sydney and thereabouts.
However, the whole thing has now been put
into the pot. There are new managers and
new directors, and there is harmony between
Sydney and Melbourne, and between this
co. and the other insurance cos. which for-
merly couldn’t stand some of joint-manager
Stockfeld’s ideas for getting business. The
machine is, therefore, practically new. What
sort of work it is going to do this paper
doesn’t know.
There certainly is room for it in Australia,
which hitherto has most unpatriotically
given a vast deal of its insurance to alien
cos. and to British cos. with alien connec-
tions. But while there is room for the co. there
is none at all for uneasiness on the part of
policy-holders. Indeed, the size of the paid
capital, which makes the early outlook for
shareholders grey, adds enormously to the
safety of policy-holders. Presently, if exes,
are cut down hard, and a better selection of
risks is made, shareholders ought to do
pretty well, too. This list shows how the
business has grown :
Net Loss Expense
Premiums. Losses. Expenses. Rate. Rate.
1911. . £25,951 £6,748 £17,537 26.0 p.c. 67.5 p.c.

1914.. 67,510 39,292 35,222 58.2 „ 52.1 „
No doubt a good deal of that £67,510 ought
to be declined without thanks. Still, a premium
income of even £50,000, derived from good
risks, would be very satisfactory considering
the age of the co.; and with anything like a
reasonable expense rate, that should easily
give an underwriting profit of 10 p.c., and
thus produce enough to pay a 6 p.c. dividend,
leaving the interest earnings to go towards
reserves. For a start, of course, even when
a profit of £7500 or more can be shown, no
dividend should be paid till the present
deficit is wiped out. And, by the way, the
deficit is really greater than the table shows,
because there is no reserve for unexpired
risks. In other words, the premiums re-
ceived in (say) December are included as
revenue for 1914, whereas the risk runs till
December, 1915. To cover this risk would
probably call for £22,500, which amount
should therefore rightly be added to the
deficit.

This co. is an offshoot of the 1.0. A., and was
formed ostensibly to carry the latter’s re-
insurance—that is, to take risks in excess of
what the parent might think it a fair thing
for one office to hold on any one line. There
was no good reason for it. If the old co.
wanted to be justified in taking more risks
all it had to do was to increase its own capi-
tal. What actually was done was to in-
crease the capital by creating a second co.,
and thus creating at the same time a second
lot of standing charges and running exes.
The expense rate of a re-insurance concern
of the kind ought, nevertheless, in any case,
to be low. This one’s isn’t, as the following
small taole shows :
Net Pre- Ex- Loss Expense
Feb., miums. Losses, penses. Rate. Rate.
1913 .. £8,558 £4,855 £3620 56.7 p.c. 42.3 p.c.

1914 .. 11,781 10,701 5220 90.8 „ 44.3 „
The past year’s exes, include £261 of bad
debts; even without that, however, the rate
is extravagant. The directors are, therefore,
not justified in saying that the deficiency on
the year’s operations “is due entirely to the
abnormally high loss ratio experienced in
common with all other cos. during 1914.”
The loss rate was abnormal, certainly,
amounting to 90.8 p.c. of the premiums. For
comparison, three representative cos. may
be taken —the Queensland, with head office
in Sydney ; the Colonial Mutual, Melbourne;
and the New Zealand. Of the first, the loss
rate last year was 51.9 p.c.; of the second,
46.1 p.c.; of the third, 62.3 p.c. These ratios
were higher than usual, but on the average
only about 3 p.c. higher. The facts, then,
are: (1) the Re-Insurance’s loss ratio was
abnormally high compared with that of typi-
cal offices; (2) the jump last year was out
of all proportion to that shown by typical
offices. There is nothing very comforting in
those conclusions. The management was
either bad or very unfortunate.
The share capital is £15,317, in 10s. shares
paid to ss. Liabilities amount to £2787,
There are assets to represent the total of
these items less £1663. The assets are very
satisfactory. Four-fifths are deposits and
public securities. The balance is mostly
money out on mortgage. The co.’s policy-
holders have, therefore, very little to worry
about. As for the shareholders, nothing
much will come their way until (1) the
risks are much better chosen, (2) the exes,
are severely cut. Any co., certainly, is
likely to be hit by one bad year; but an ex-
pense rate of 42 p.c. for a re-insurarice co. is
little short of disgraceful.

The Life Insurance Co. of Australia :

1914.. 33,412 23,951 7655 31,606 20,146
For the first time in its life this co.’s in-
come exceeded its expenses and claims. But
that isn’t the same as saying that it lived
within its income. To take one. line only,
the total amount of the policies in the
Ordinary department, according to the re-
port. jumped during the year from £156,195
to £321,440. Now, that £321,440 represents
a liability. The most amazing thing about
nearly all of the life offices which have
sprung up during the past few years is that
they always refer joyfully to the great
growth of policies as though the latter were
simply so many assets. They are the means
by which offices get their income, no doubt;
but they are also and more certainly pro-
mises to pay. What the cos. will derive
from them is more or less uncertain. Nobody
in this case has definitely undertaken to pay
the office £321,440, but the office has de-
finitely undertaken to pay somebody
£321,440. And in order to be able to pay
that amount the office needs to do something
a great deal more than merely provide for
current exes, and claims. It needs also to
put a very considerable amount by towards
meeting the accruing liabilities. Down to
the past year this office did nothing in that
way. Last year it did a little. If in the
current year it does more, and next year
does still more, and then goes on doing
better and better, policy-holders will by-and-
bye get bonuses. The Bulletin hopes that
they will all live long enough to do it. At
present the position is that, of £44,000 put
up by the shareholders, there is only
£23.854 intact. In other words, to get the
present business and pay the few claims that
have already arisen, the co. has consumed all
the premiums thus far received plus £20,146
of the shareholders’ capital.
Admittedly every new life office has a hard
row to hoe. And the trouble which the critic
is up against is that, no matter how strong
his natural inclination may be to give the
young pup a chance, he can’t honestly advise
anybody to put his money on the pup, when
there are so many old dogs on the hard road.
The pup may turn out a prize dog; but life
insurance isn’t the sort of thing you can
afford to experiment with. You can’t say,
“I’ll give the pup a chance, and if, in 10
years, it doesn’t turn out well, I’ll go over
to one of the old dogs.” You can’t afford to
waste 10 years. Besides, in 10 years the old
dog may turn you down.
This, however, can be said for the L.I.A.
—no. L.C.A. The share capital put up was
so substantial that for the present the policy-
holder seems to be well protected. No valua-
tion of liabilities under policies has yet been
made; that is, no actuary has yet been
engaged to determine what amount the co.
should have accumulated towards meeting the
obligations under its policies. But the
amount is certainly not likely to be equal to
the £21,000 or so of solid assets owned by the
co. (It claims £23,854. but included in that
are such whimsical items as £6OO for sta
tionery in hand.) In this respect the co. is
much better placed than almost any other of
the very new offices. It talks now of “a
vigorous campaign for Ordinary department
business, which in the directors’ opinion
offers the best field for a new and progressive
co.” Well, .that is open to question. One
thing seems certain: a name counts for
much less in getting an Industrial or Provi-
dent policy involving the collection of a few
pence a week from the wharf-laborers’ missus
than in getting an Ordinary policy for £lOOO
from a business man. In any case, not even
the A.M.P. or the M.L.C. can go beyond
what may be called its natural limitations
and preserve a decent expense rate. Nor can
this or any other young office ; and the limi-
tations in such cases are naturally very
narrow. It is better to get a small amount
at a reasonable cost than a large amount at
an unreasonable cost. It is all very nice to
read of vigorous campaigns. French and
Joffre would probably tell you that patience
is a virtue, too.

Well, it’s a lucky bank that can come (through
six months of mixed war and drought and
show almost the biggest profit on record.
And it is luckier still if it can do so after
making internal provision for all possible
losses that ought reasonably to be provided
for. In fact, it is coming to this. On the
outbreak of war everybody who had any re-
gard for the public safety said: “Now, don’t
harass the banks. They need a hand —give
it to them. Keep them strong, so that pre-
sently when help is wanted they may be
able to give it.” That was the right attitude.
But presently there will be a suspicion that
the banks are getting the best of the deal.
This, anyhow, isn’t a time when banks ought
to be making more money than usual. It
isn’t a time for squeezing the last possible
i per cent, out of customers. It is rather
a time for giving concessions. If banks show
that their present policy is fetching them in
more money than ever, they will suffer for
it presently.
Compared with 12 months ago present
figures are as follows :
Feb., T 4. Feb., T 5.
Notes and bills . . £5,847 £5,086 Dec. £761
Deposits .. ..1,919,117 1,910,862 Dec. 8,255
Liquid assets .. 599,140 780,423 Inc. 181,283
Advances .. . . 1,740,319 1,555,641 Dec. 184,678
Premises ... . . 55,094 58,003 Inc. 2,919
Thus a profit just about equal to that of 12
months ago has been made with a substan-
tially-reduced risk ; for £184,678 of advances
have been turned into liquid assets, and the
money is either held or has been repaid to
depositors. Comparatively, the position is,
therefore, stronger than it was a year ago.
And, positively, it is strong. The liquid
assets exceed 40 p.c. of the liabilities; and
that is enough to meet any but the most ex-
ceptional contingency. Further, the public’s
money in the business is less than £5 for
every" £1 of the shareholders’ own funds; and
that is a couple of pounds below what is re-
garded as a safe amount to borrow. The
bank is, therefore, very well prepared to meet
either a sudden emergency or a long, pro-
found slump ; and at the same time the mar-
gin of profits over the dividend paid suggests
that the former could stand a severe cut be-
fore the directors would have to do anything
unpleasant.
Metters, Ltd., manufacturers of stoves,
windmills, oil engines, etc., who paid
£29,656 for the goodwill of the business.
In the table this item is not regarded as an

From one point of view things are not as
good as they look in that first column. In
1911-12, when the profits were £18,665, the
capital for the greater part of the year was
under £100,000; for the past year, when
the profit was a shade less, the capital was
£164,133. And more than that, while the
total liabilities in the earlier year were
about £57,000, the co. is now responsible
for the repayment of upwards of £67.000.
The weight of these liabilities was no doubt
responsible for the passing of a dividend 12
months ago; and it seems to be with some
misgiving that the directors now pay a
modest 5 p.c. These are not the results
that one likes to see from an Australian
manufacturing business. The fact is wages
have got ahead of the Custom tariff; more-
over, the perf;ectly-mad borrowing indulged
in by two or three of the State Governments
—especially the N.S.W. Government—has
created an industrial boom and produced
entirely artificial wages and conditions;
and manufacturers and other employers
are handicapped in consequence. To
some manufacturers it hasn’t mattered
a tin-tack. People must buy hats;
wherefore a hat manufacturer said a
while ago: "They can boom things till wages
are up to 30s. a day if they like so long as
they push the tariff up to allow me with
my 305.-a-day men to compete with
foreigners at 35.” Rut there are other
manufacturers, like Metters, who sell things
that the public doesn’t have to buy ; and a
rapid increase of prices means diminished
trade. Besides, with a lagging tariff, it
means the purchase of foreign goods. When
the borrowing bubble breaks —and it is only
being propped up now —things are going
to be bad for a lot of people who won’t see
that the prosperity of the past few years
has been artificial. But for manufacturers
it isn’t going to be all wormwood.
The Bulletin’s own view is that
Metters, Ltd., put too much into land and
buildings. This comparison shows how

Land and buildings, £88,402 —more than
half the capital. A co. can’t do that sort
of thing and expect to show a big return on
capital at the same time. If, for instance,
it earns 6 p.c. net on the money it has in
city warehouses, it is doing remarkably
well. Factory premises are rather different;
you can’t expect trustees and such like who
are looking for gilt-edged 5 p.c. investments
to put up suburban factories to suit you.
Portion of Metters’s £88,402 is factory pro-
perty ; a lot of it is city showrooms, etc.
This must have a steadying effect on profits
for many years to come ; and the fact that
so much money has been borrowed, partly
because it seems necessary to carry very
heavy stocks, must also steady things up—
especially in a time like this when money
is going to be dearer and trade generally is
probably going to be poorer.

When you are not a borrower in Maoriland
you are a lender; and this co. is in the
market to be either one or the other. Its
own liabilities are £359,788, and its “mort-
gages and other securities” amount to
£524,621, exclusive of business premises,
bank deposits and a few trifles. The posi-
tion as well as 10 years* movement is shown

This sort of business may be quite safe; ail
that The Bulletin can say is that, on paper,
it doesn’t look it. Here is a co. which has
undertaken to repay £359,788, and its liquid
assets amount to only £14,483. The balance
is in “mortgages and other securities.” The
bulk is in mortgages, many of them fixed.
But even if they were not fixed, how could
the co. hope to get in money in periods of
profound depression such as Maoriland has
had before, and must have again? If the
deposits are fixed also for long terms, well
spread, things might pass, though even then
it is doubtful whether it would be possible
to quite safely run the business on so small
a holding of liquid assets. But if the
deposits are liable to be called for in large
amounts within a year, the Maoriland policy
of nailing them down in mortgages is going
to produce trouble again some day. Assum-
ing that it will never be pushed and will
always have time to realise its securities, of
course this co. is all right. Its liabilities
are less than £2 for every £1 of its own
funds. Assuming that its assets other than
mortgages are worth 20s. in the £, and at
once realisable, then there would be £524,621
of mortgages to pay £325.045 of debt. That
is to say, if every £lOO of security brought
only £62 there would be enough for all the
creditors. A very high value has been
put on many Maoriland properties of late ;
but even so, given time to realise them,
there are not many that wouldn’t fetch a
lot more than two-thirds of their present
value. And this co. isn’t at all likely to
have advanced up to the full present value.
In fact, though the war and other things
must have suggested caution, the manage-
ment feel so well satisfied with its securi-
ties that of £5OO set aside for depreciation
contingencies a while ago, it has written
back £2OO as not being required for the
mirpose. Lucky co. if it can’t see a possi-
bility of losing £2OO anywhere!

Efficient grinding is one of the many problems
that mine managers have to solve. The Hardinge
Conical Mills have proved to the Calumet and Ilecla

problem ; they have installed 64 of them, and say
“the Ilardinge Conical Mill is the most efficient
grinding machine we have yet gotten hold of.” If
they sav this of the mills, it should be worth the
while of mine managers here to inquire about them.

Extract from The Review, London, December 5,
1913: —“The Colonial Mutual occupies a unique posi-
tion amongst offices doing business in Australia, inas-
much as it is the first office in that country to submit
its affairs (including securities) for an independent
Government inspection and valuation. The inspec-
tors appointed by the Government have recently re-
ported to Parliament that the Society is thoroughly
‘sound and solvent, and able to meet all its lia-
bilities both immediate and prospective.’ ”* [6

The Australian Provincial Assurance Association
Limited still continues to make steady progress, and
business continues to come in satisfactorily in all
departments. The directors feel confident that, not
only will the amount of new business written for
the current financial year be considerably in excess
of the preceding year, but that the cost ratio
will be considerably reduced and quite satisfactory;
whilst the renewals received for the first three (3)
months of this financial year exceed those for the
corresponding three months of the last financial year
by 300%. The Queensland Branch collected 84% of
the expectancy of the February renewals, which pro-
bably approached something like a record in this
respect, and reflects great credit on everybody con-
nected with that branch. There is no doubt that
this office is making steady progress, which shows
the energy and enthusiasm displayed by all those
connected with the Association.*

This year’s report is highly creditable to
everybody concerned. While copper and
copper-gold mines all over the continent
were shut down on the outbreak of war, the
low-grade Wallaroo and Moonta managed to
keep its people together. The mining fields of
Australia usually gibe at the Moonta man
as a poor Cousin Jack prepared to take any-
thing Cap’ll Hancock offers him. But in
the long run the Moonta miner is as well
off as most and better off than many. It
is true lie never makes £1 a shift except by
accident; but things have to get shockingly
bad before he is turned adrift. The bowel-
less habit of the London co. is to shut the
mine down in times of low prices, and have
a share-rigging furnace campaign when the
metal market is favorable. Wallaroo and
Moonta doesn’t do that. The co. works on
co-operative principles to this extent —that
wages move up and down within certain
limits with the copper market. Certainly
there is room for a difference of opinion as
to whether the upward movement doesn’t
stop too soon.
The co.’s principal trouble when war
started was that its market was gone. By
means of Protection and the Hunnish work-
man’s habit of keeping his nose to the grind-
stone, Germany collared the electrical trade,
and “Wallaroo” copper followed it. The co.
had therefore to instantly get busy to find a
new market. It succeeded. Meantime, how-
ever, copper had slumped badly ; but with the
co-operation of the S. Aus. Government
(which made advances), the bank, and the
men (who accepted a 20 p.c. cut) work was
kept going. Presently things improved, and
in February the 20 p.c. cut was reduced to
10 p.c. Even with the 20 p.c. cut in force,
and with things going well in the first month
of the second half of the year, the directors
estimate that of the total profit of £39,997
only the £9997 was made since June 30.
The average realised for the copper was
£6l 6s. 9d., as against £69 15s. 9d. the pre-
vious year. This fall of £8 9s. would have
carried away all the surplus but for a saving
in the cost of production. The figures as to
that for some few years past have been :
1907 .. £73 17 9 | 1911 .. £5l 12 5
1908 .. 54 16 8 I 1912 .. 56 18 9
1909 .. 53 3 11 | 1913 .. 56 15 10
1910 .. 54 11 2 ! 1914 .. 51 18 3
The refined copper produced at the smelting
works was 7022 tons, against 7112 tons the
previous year.
The co. now says almost the last word in
mechanical concentration. In the days
before flotation and other recent improve-
ments the figures were poor: last year the
recoveries, excluding those from old material
re-handled, were 95.8 p.c. of the contents at
Wallaroo, and 93.8 p.c. at Moonta. In-
cluding old material the average was 93.6
p.c. And possibly in time a part of
even the 6.4 p.c. may be recovered by cemen-
tation or leaching. During the past year
the Moonta dumps, which nowadays are
kept well scarified, yielded 754 tons of metal
by this very inexpensive process. No esti-
mate of ore reserves is* ever made. A few
people would probably shiver if it were other-
wise. Plans are, however, nowadays pre-
sented, showing, at any rate, how thoroughly
the ore has been cleaned out from the sur-
face down to 2000 ft. in those parts where
it has been found of payable grade. It is
a question now of continuous prospecting;
and that means money, and there isn’t much
to waste, with ore averaging in the case of
Wallaroo a shade under 4| p.c. copper, and
at Moonta a shade under 4 p.c. And there
is no fat surplus of accumulated profits to
comfortably sit back against either, for
though liquid and semi-liquid assets over
liabilities are placed at £171.973, no less
than £84,174 is in that doubtful line “Stores,
fuel and forage.”

The Colonial Sugar Co.’s second co. is to
be registered in Fiji, where there isn’t any
beastly Labor party. The idea is to give
the new concern a capital of £3,500,000, of
which £3.250,000 will be represented by 6
p.c. pref. shares issued to present C.S.R.
holders —share for share. The co. will take
the other £250,000 in ordinary shares. The
chairman repeats that the new arrangement
won’t increase the profits; in fact, the .pre-
sent 12J p.c. div. is to he cut down to 6 p.c.
until £195,000 —a year’s pref. dividend—has
been set aside and invested outside the co.
The effect of the proposed transaction will
be to double the capital without calling up
anything from the shareholders; so that a
6 p.c. div. on the new shares and a 64 p.c.
div. on the old shares will be equal to the
present disbursement.

Amalgamated Zinc hasn’t had the same
luck as the Broken Hill Prop., and no Yankee
offers it can get for zinc concentrates are
tempting enough. Therefore concentrates go
on accumulating; and 50,000 tons are already
dumped. The big question was whether
the co. should stop work and dump the raw
product, which is supplied by the North and
South cos.: but big Baillieu and his co-
directors decided that, as long as they can
finance it. it will pay them better to keep
at work and save a second handling.
The prospectus of the Australian Pictorial
Newspaper Co. is issued “for private circu-
lation only.” The capital is £125,000 in
100,000 ordinary and 25,000 deferred shares ;
the object, to establish a ha’penny illustrated
daily paper in Sydney. Figures published
relating to the circulation of cheap illus-
trated papers in London are highly attrac-
tive, and on that account alone the project is
worth considering. The fatal defect in the
present scheme is the basis on which the
shares are submitted. The 100,000 ordinary
shares are offered to the public, who will
be allotted one free deferred share for every
10 ordinaries. The other 15,000 belong to
the promoters. These deferred shares carry
half the profits in excess of 10 p.c. payable
on the ordinaries. In other words, the people
who put up all the money in this hazardous
speculation are limited to 10 p.c. plus seven-
tenths of any excess profits, while the pro-
moters who put up no money at all get (1)
lucrative billets and (2) three-tenths of
the profits in excess of 10 p.c. Further, the
directors may proceed to allotment on 25,000
shares, and the promoters take just as many
shares in that case as if the whole 100,000
were put off. Deferred shares of this sort
were a trick of the last London company-
floating boom, and earned such universal con-
demnation that nobody would now think of
offering them there; and they are a good
thing to suppress on this side also.

Dr. Wade, a London oilman, who was
imported to advise the Federal Government
concerning the oil-fields of Papua, conducted
a geological survey of about 1000 miles of
territory before pronouncing an opinion. In
his report to the local Government on the
likelihood of finding rock-oil in South Aus.,
just issued in Adelaide, Dr. Wade has ex-
pressed an opinion unfavorable to petroleum
being found in South Aus., and has done it
without any geological survey at all. Cer-
tainly he qualifies his dictum as to the
south-eastern district, where there is, he
says, “a faint possibility” of oil being
found. How any geologist can express an
opinion worth a pinch of dust in the ab-
sence of geological plans or other data about
the rocks, is a mystery. There are, by the
way, only two geological maps in existence
in the South Aus. Mines Department: one
relating to the Tarcoola goldfield, and the
other dealing with the brown coal area near
Leigh’s Creek. After all, the drills alone
can tell whether oil exists in the sands below
the limestone, say 3000 or 4000 feet down.
Majorca Alluvial (Vic.) has held
what is delicately described as a
stormy meeting. The bone of conten-
tion was the payment to one of the direc-
tors of 500 shares “as commission for influ-
encing the raising of capital.” The discus-
sion turned on the question whether a direc-
tor should be paid for services rendered dur-
ing its formation. Certainly, provided he
hasn’t been already paid indirectly. Most
mining cos. are floated with difficulty when
launched without a current boom; and
whoever influences cash into the co.’s
bank account is surely entitled to
brokerage. The chances are that nothing
would have ever been heard of this squabble
if the manager had not been a brother of
the director. A stranger would have kept
the transaction regular.

Want of water has cut battery work down
at the New Golden Fleece, Bendigo; and
the question is asked again whether the
show has a chance. All that can be said
definitely is that on 20s. stone the co. has
made small profits. The grade looks like
improving. If it got up to Sdwt., an air
of prosperity would pervade McColl and
Rankin’s board-room like that noticeable
when New Chum Goldfields entered the list
of div. payers. Two levels —620 ft. and
650 ft. —are being used to work the Golden
Gate shoot on the pitch from 580 ft. The
crosscut at 650 ft. is in likely-looking coun-
try for spurs, and beyond the east back the
co. should have Bft. or 9ft. of crushing
material to handle. So far Bendigonians
haven't done any Perseus hunt after the new
Golden Fleece, but popularity would follow
developments either at the bottom level or if
deeper sinking showed the way to another
saddle.
Andrew Stenhouse, great old warrior, is
the king of Tindal’s, Coolgardie, the show
that is always going to do something- but
never does it. Its trouble is low-grade
stone developed at No. 3 level, and the
presence of so much silver in the gold that
the value is reduced to £3 6s. per oz. To
have a show the co. must cut expenses, or
open up better stone north at No. 3, or
punch into No. 4 level in the hope that depth
will bring improvement. Receipts just
balance expenses, so there is some induce-
ment to persevere. Also there is plenty of
room ; for 20 years’ work on the mine has
only resulted in three levels being
developed.
No one can find fault with costs at Edna
May Central (W.A.). To treat over 9000
tons for a shade over 15s. Sd. per ton is
good work, even though the workings be shal-
low, the mining easy, and the plant new.
The formations carry mostly more than less
kaolin. Therefore everything is passed
to the mill. The dissatisfied management is
alleged to have set apart a special shift to
fervently pray for solid fjuartz. Taking the
profits shown, the supplication should be for
more gold. But in any case they expect to get
that when the No. 3 level is opened ; for does
not A. E. Morgan testify “that the physical
features of the vein, so far as we have ex-
plored it, show the quartz bodies to be very
wide and continuous, and, as we attain
depth, the ore bodies will become more con-
solidated and more massive”? As quickly as
bad air permits a winze is going down, so
that the acid can be applied to the rumor that
the face of the Edna May Co.’s 225 ft. level
shows 2oz. dirt, pitching into the Central.
A. E. Morgan meanwhile has, his eye on a
kaolinised deposit near the shaft. This is
of fair extent and can be sent to the battery
at a trifling cost, to serve as a pot-boiler till
certain probabilities can be demonstrated.
These are (1) that the Edna shoot pitches
into the claim, and (2) that when in tight
country the shoots of stone have payable
gold contents. Skirmishing near the surface
hasn’t settled either point.
* it * *
Mararoa, Norseman, getting low with
ore reserves in its own mine, has cast a net
round a claim near Weston’s, on which it
is spending a hundred or two under working
option. Then it has snapped up, for the
liberal figure of £4OOO, the Hardy Norseman,
east of and side on to its own Mararoa lease.
The purchase was made after manager Hen-
derson had tripped to Adelaide to take coun-
sel with his Board. The Hardy Norseman
will be joined to the Sydney Norseman,
already held by the co., which now possesses
a big length on the main Norseman line, near
where the Viking is yielding rattling profits.
Henderson reports a shoot 100 ft. long and
sft. wide, worth 50s. per ton, being proved
at 170 ft.. with the face in ore. So Mararoa
apparently has something more substantial
to chase than when it went prodding round
at the Ruby Well Options.
The big rise in Empress shares has sur-
prised most people in Westralia. The show
produced about £15.000 worth of gold up
to the end of 1904, and then lay idle
till 1908. Between that time and the present
it was first optioned and then purchased by
a Melbourne co. The nominal capital
(£30.000) is in 60.000 10s. shares, of which
45,000 were offered and are reputed to be
in the possession of the public. The vendors
took £lO,OOO out of the proceeds, and as the
little that was left has since been expended
calls are being made to keep going. Nothing
has been found since flotation to warrant the
rise, and apparently the market is going nap
on the manager’s optimistic belief that at
250 ft. the reef when opened up will average
3oz. The mine has tertainly furnished some
rich returns, but there is no definite evi-
dence that it will be permanently good. The
district has so far proved poor at depth;
Golden Horseshoe (W.A.) is credited in
London with having made a working profit
last year of £62,000, or about £16,000 below
that for 1913. Fully £38,000 has to be
deducted for development and £12,500 for
redemption of debentures, and as several
other items of expenditure have to be taken
into account there won’t be much left for
shareholders. Monthly profits have, however,
been showing an improvement lately, and
in view of this .the Board, which has the
reputation of being rather venturesome, may
take something out of this year’s earnings to
help pay a div. on last year’s results.

“Long Gully” : The Bendigo boom of 1870-1
was a boom. Macartney’s book about the
old goldfield says that in the last six months
of 1870 and during 1871 over 1550 cos. were
floated. with a nominal capital of
£18.000,000. The Garden Gully cos. reached
a value of £2,000,000 in the market. Alto-
gether, 30,000,000 shares were issued in the
18 months; Macartney states that they aver-
aged on ’Change ss. each, or £7,500,000 in
all. No fewer than 707 mines were gold-
yielding, and the output was 5000 oz. weekly.
In 1870-1 76 cos. naid divs., mostly from ore
mined above 400 ft. The deepest was Coll-
mann and Tacchi’s 720 ft.
The flotation process as developed by Aus-
tralian metallurgists has caught on rapidly
in U.S.A.. which last year had a bumper
harvest of 533,373 short tons of lead and
360,000 short tons of spelter. Enormous
quantities of tailings and slimes have been
stacked in Missouri, and these are now being
drawn on. This makes it doubtful whether
Australia need expect to find much of a
permanent market for its zinc concentrates
in the U.S.A.
* * * *
South Aus. has got on to opal at last,
somewhere far north in Stuart’s Range. The
Government Geologist pronounces it “in all
respects similar” to White Cliffs specimens,
and produced by the same “desert sandstone”
formation. S.A. has any quantity of this
latter, but so far it had produced nothing in
the valuable-mineral way.
Golden Horseshoe Co.’s litigation with a
German firm has been hung up pending the
decision of the House of Lords in an Eng-
lish case of dealing with an alien enemy.
When the case came before the Perth
Supreme Court Chief Justice McMillan,
whose judgments are rarely upset, agreed
with the Horseshoe’s contention that a
patent granted in the West to Sulman and
Teed was worthless, but was against the
co. in regard to the validity of a Common-
wealth patent granted to Diehl and others.

their patients. Until twelve years ago I was nursing
in S. Austrlaia, but since then I have been nursing
at Broken Hill. I have had lengthy experience and
can endorse every word other nurses have sa-'d about

A
WOMAN'S
LETTER
Sydney, March 29, 1915.
My Dear Arini, —
G.-G. Ferguson and Excellency Helen
have mentioned, in writing, that they will
be at St. Vincent’s Hospital concert on
April 10. The Strickland family will pro-
bably be present in bulk, as the domestic
gods are on their way to the Rose Bay camp
from Moss Vale. Mrs. Hugh Ward is put-
ting a head and tail to the programme.
Miss Rose Scott purred gently over Mrs.
Henry Dobson behind the teacups last week.
The party was by way of patting the cheery,
imposing-looking Tasmanian on her shoulder
for representing the National Council of
Women in a recent confab, in Rome. I am
still too dazed by the tale of amendments and
resolutions to know what the exact result
has been. Anyhow, William 11. has not shown
any signs of reformation as a result of the
unfurling of the ladies’ peace umbrella, and
is still the bad boy of the whole Potsdam
family. At the tea party, ere the company
had assuaged its thirst, Mrs. MacCallum
threw a few welcome remarks at Mrs. Dob-
son, who bowed her bonnet in reply. Also
present: the sisters Fry; Mrs. Sara
Nolan, the W.C.T.U. pillar who would
fall upon the last beer-pot and smash
it: Mrs. Jim McGowen; Miss Annie
Parkes, a daughter of the one-time pic-
turesque Premier and once his secretary;
many lights of the Nat. Council; Mrs.
Burley Griffin, wife of the Canberra archi-
tect, a tall U.S. lady with an aesthetic figure
and a sparkling manner; and Miss May
Mathews, a toiler in the Women’s Labor
vineyard.
U.S. Consul-General Bray, who is depart-
ing for Singapore, is first having much
fatted chicken slain in his honor. The Mil-
lions Club, which feeds so many official
visitors. » gave him a mid-day snack. A
political feast at Parliament House is also
on the list. So the U.S. citizen with the
unctuous manner will have several chances
of saying what he doesn’t think of us, in a
voice that seems to percolate through clotted
cream.
The Political Labor Conference, which
has a big feminine chorus, meets this year
in Easter week. One motion on the agenda
paper is that old Government House ought
to go back to its former use as a shelter for
State Governors, the vacant Cranbrook to
be then utilised as a convalescent hospital.
There’ll be wigs on the green if this resolu-
tion is passed and handed in to the Cabinet;
but a few prominent Labor women are sup-
posed to be strongly in favor of it.
Captain Selby Smith, who fell in action
the. other day, was A.D.C. to Governor
Strickland during his Westralian term. He
married Miss Drummond, a cousin of Lady
Edeline, some years ago.
Offley Wakeman, of the Grenadier Guards,
the very mild young man who floated On to
the Strickland Help department during a
tour round the world, slid off it to join his
regiment a while ago. The last English
mail brought word that the flaxen-haired
Guardsman was then just off to meet the foe
in the once-pleasant land of France.
The Rajah of Bong (or somewhere), who
is wandering here as plain Mr. Pudukota,
waves aside official attentions, and pays
his way as an ordinary tourist. He is so
keen to see more of us that he is likely to
have some bumpy moments on our worst
roads. Society, which yearns to clasp a
genuine Rajah, hasn’t been encouraged in
this process. The Indian gentleman didn’t
come here to be stalked for Mrs. Leo
Hunter’s menagerie, and he dodges the social
baits with conspicuous success. Judging by
the name he has taken he comes from the
fastnesses of Mysore, beyond Bangalore—
which is the Bourke or Canberra of India—
and I shouldn’t be surprised if he has seen
bumpy tracks before he came this way.
Keith Brown, who belongs to the new
corps of young men just turned out from
Sydney Uni. with stethoscopes, represents
the third generation of medical Browns in
the once vice-regal village of Parramatta.
Over 60 years ago, grandfather Brown was
the kindly Government medical officer of
the old town; father W. S. Brown nowadays
tends the many local Government institu-
tions between golf and bowls; and now a
youngster is ready to carry on the high
family traditions.
Captain Carr, R.N.. who went down in
the unfortunate Bayano, used to navigate
these waters in the little Psyche. He was
a very popular tar in the days when naval
hops turned a cruiser’s guns into deck orna-
ments draped with bunting.
A serious gathering at Bishopscourt the
other afternoon took the question of the
Ladies’ Home Mission Union to its best
fichu front. Archbishop Wright was in
charge of the meeting. Mrs. Archbishop —a
buxom lady with very dark, bright eyes —
welcomed the visitors in the remote official
way in which a lady dignitary of the Church
always does shake the laity by the hand.
His Gaiters’ sister, Miss Wright, and his
daughters, less aloof than mamma, passed
round refreshments with vociferous hospi-
tality. A limited selection of local Society,
which had torn itself away from bridge and
other home comforts, looked down its nose
while parson Yeates detailed life in the
slums. Mostly it was a sordid tale of the
Wild Girl of the Family and the heathen
Chinee. A collection for the Mission Fund
put a silver top to the proceedings.
Wonder who’s the Australian barrister
that gave up £5OOO a year to enlist in the
first Australian expedition'? He has been
buying carpets at prices that made an
Egyptian bazaar-dealer wish a few more
Tommy Kangaroos would come his way. The
Daily Chronicle’s special Cairo correspon-
dent, who went with him to the non-bargain
counter, appears to have been almost as much
impressed by his affluence as the dragoman
who chaperoned the shopping expedition.
Three Egyptian carpets—two valued at £5O
apiece, a third at £lO0 —the result of the
morning’s shopping, ought to be just about
unpacked by now.
The girl with a retrousse nose is going, to
look her best in the new cocked hats, which
are small and turn up everywhere. Thus
everything will be en suite, as they say in
the upholstery business. Some of the round
black headgear is rather larger than a
small tart, and it sits on youthful craniums
with a pronounced tilt to one side.
Dr. Gilruth is passing the time of day to
Sydney friends as I gum this up. He re-
turns to Darwin and his N.T. friends and
enemies forthwith.
Ellen Terry’s tragic struggles to see half-
inch print ought to be safely over by now.
On leaving Australia the famous woman
went to the U.S.A.; but she had to stop short
in her tour, and go to New York for an
operation for cataract. The poor lady’s
panting efforts to get enough light for her
readings here made those entertainments a
nerve strain for most of the audience. There
is no cable of disaster, so the cataract has
probably been removed with success.
Mrs. Keith Jopp’s Sock Fund committee,
with Mrs. Harry Finn on the look-out for
your immediate contribution, is rushing to
a grand climax. By April 24 the knitting-
generals hope to have organised a huge con-
signment to send away to the 50.000 pairs of
Kangaroo soles that are likely to be stamp-
ing over foreign soil in May. Packets of
boracic powder, to dust on sore places, go
with each woolly comfort. Boracic, thank
goodness, shows no signs of emulating the
recent crisis in cream of tartar.
Mr. H. D. Baker, a one-time U.S. Consul
here, has just acquired the rocky billet of
special Commercial Agent for the Stars and
Stripes in Petrograd.
Fanny Durack, N.S.W., who is the world’s
champion mermaid, will only go to
the U.S.A. for the July carnivals provided a
strictly amateur atmosphere prevails. The
passionate desire not to make money at sport
is a beautiful thing from a feminine point
of view, but I asked “Snowy” R. L. Baker
what he thought about it. The owner of
four motors and many other desirable assets
said with a sigh that he, too, was an amateur
once. “There’s a kind of glamor about it in
youth,” he added, “but it runs into a lot of
money and doesn’t pay the butcher.” If
Miss Durack would break into the profes-
sional ranks, there’s a sure fortune, it seems,
waiting to fall on her lap. The Movies
alone would put furs on her shoulders and
pearls around her neck. But for the
present, anyhow, the Sydney mermaid is
inclined to turn her back hair to the voice
of the siren.
It was “Snowy” Baker who gave Annette
Kellerman her first diving lesson. It was on
a Sunday afternoon in the old Woolloomooloo
Baths, after the men had gone. Annette, then
14, climbed up to a 45ft. high plank,
and R. L. Baker poured instruction into her
ear. She missed her cue or something, and
turned over in mid-air, falling flat on he r
back. Her alarmed instructor ran down to
pick up a corpse, but found instead a- very
live Annette, clamoring to try it again.
Which she did, making-three perfect dives
in succession. This determination has
pushed the Australian mermaid into a
world’s cluSMnion lady-fish, with a salary
only expressed by several figures.
Mrs. Ellis Rowan’s water-colors, now
showing in Anthony Horderns’ Gallery, were
formally introduced the other afternoon by
Francis Suttor, M.L.C. Manager Gillett’s
spectacles flashed at this ceremony, which
occurred about half an hour after the com-
pany had “done” the pictures in the usual
record time. Mrs. Rowan’s brush wanders
over acres of Australian flora in this exhibi-
tion of about 140 pictures. She tracks the
shy wild blooms of tropic jungles to their
fastnesses, and serves up banks of orchids,
fields of native heath, and groves of wattle,
extra large. The artists’ home is at Mace-
don, Victoria, and various studies of the
vegetation of the fashionable Mount are a
consequence.
The heights and the depths of Vaucluse
shelter a number of successful city men.
The ladies of the Red Cross Society have dug
these people out, and have put the spurs into
them in the interests of patriotic effort- —and
money. There is quite a lot of money, which
is not being given by our wealthy men, and
the market is also not overstocked with male
effort; and the Vaucluse women are out after
both. Apart from the usual weekly socks
and pillowslips they are running a big art
union, which is now on a fair way to fur-
nishing a motor ambulance, and their next
by-product is to be a Gigantic (with two
G’s) Red Cross Carnival, to be held .at the
Stadium, Rushcutter’s Bay, on the night of
April 13. For this event, which is being-
smiled upon by the whole Red Cross move-
ment, the charmers have roped in the Sta-
dium, and R. L. Baker, and Massed Bands-
men, and Swordsmen, and Acrobats, and
Bayoneters, and Riflemen, and Lightning
Sketeliers, and Hugh Ward, and the theatri-
cals of the Williamson and Tivoli circuits.
Even the Governor, though so far he hasn’t
promised to do as much as a Turkey trot.
Dr. and Mrs. Ashburton Thompson and
her daughter Norah Simpson are going to
England. As chairman of the State’s Health
Board in the time of the bubonic plague,
Ashburton Thompson, who is an authority
on the subject, as he is on leprosy,
helped to strangle the beast most effect-
ually. His stepdaughter Norah, who dab-
bled in art in Datillo Rubbo’s studio, had a
little souvenir thrust into her keeping the
other day; and fellow students who clus-
tered round wished her a rosy future with
her brush.
Mrs. Ethel Phillips Fox, after working as
energetically as a nest of ants for the artists’
war fund, has been called on to go slow.
Sitting at the receipt of custom in the R.A.
Society’s hot-air chamber left her a very
limp artist. A limited number of tickets
are still for sale, though the business-like
Francis Chapman, father of the youthful
Evelyn, has been selling them by the
cwt. No artist gets even a tram-ticket out
of this show, which is still spread out in
the R. A. Society’s rooms. The subscrip-
tion system appeals to philanthropists, who
will swell with pride when they see the
framed results on the parlor wall.
At the tableaux in which the art students
are going to help the artists swell their War
Fund, Florence Rodway’s golden hair will
be a-hanging down her back. She is to
stand (or sit, maybe) robed in fluffy white
of the early Grecian bath-sheet period, with
a large gold sun behind her. As “The Golden
Fleece” I suppose she is Mrs. Jason looking
for the rain which the thirsty Riverina is
gasping for just now.
After all the columns of print which the
debutante’s white plumage provokes in the
press, Man in the abstract is apparently
u'nmoved. He believes that a debutante is
something young and good to look at, but
he is not certain about the color of her outer
shell. Therefore artist Julian Ashton puts
“The Debutante” (now hanging on the R. A.
Society’s walls) into a blue gown, sticks a
pink rose in her hair, and adds a touch of
green to one shoulder. There’s no reason
why she shouldn’t wear these clothes, instead
of the usual white shimmer. It’s an artistic
digression from feminine tradition.
Mrs. Ivirkham (Kate Rooney) writes in
enthusiastic adjectives of the personal
appearance of “Little Billy, ”. otherwise
Ivirkham junior. After alluding to her
Treasure —who is still blissfully ignorant of
the terrors of cutting back teeth —the Aus-
tralian singer mentions such small affairs
as musical engagements. Kate recently
appeared at the initial performance of two
plays in connection with the Irish Theatre
in America. This was at the Central Opera
House, New York. After folding up iter
letter, the popular contralto was to travel
to Boston for a short season. She hopes
to bring Little Billy to Australia this year
to see his grandparents.
The wedding of Esther Harris, only
daughter of the lawyer who has such a
pleasant way of telling Sydney Judges the
unpleasant things the police know about
their prisoners, took place in Essex some
weeks ago. The groom, who follows the
usual occupation, is E. Vernon Hine, of the
Royal Fusiliers.
Optimists hope to rake in about £5OO to
the Belgian fund as the result of the Jewish
children’s fete in the Manchester Unity
Tlall. Consul Watteeuw opened the show.
The rush for cash on the part of the juven-
iles in charge is something to be remembered
in a chastened spirit by mere Gentiles. The
combined ages of president and vice-presi-
dent might total about 28. As a youngsters’
patriotic attack on the public purse, this
show, which raged for two days, is going to
take a lot of beating.
Mrs. Parker, a sister of Kitchener —she
used to live in Maoriland —has been laying
down the law (you expect a firm attitude in
K. of Iv.’s relative) as to the value of clubs
for the wives of soldiers and sailors. At
Chatham the lady appears to have wiped the
carpet with any other lady who ventured to
disagree with her. She claims that these
circles —mostly of tired women, with little
children clinging to their skirts—show great
aptitude at sewing and knitting for the
cause. The speaker quoted the experience
of Australian women who run similar
clubs. One Australian woman—who would
be cast into outer darkness if I breathed her
name —could tell Mrs. Parker something. At
a big gathering at the Royal -INaval House,
there were two volunteers to do what they
could for some patriotic sewing-spree. And
even those two admitted they would have to
learn how to use knitting needles.
Frances Dumaresq, an Australian M.A.,
B.Sc., took the London Teachers’ Diploma
at Bedford College (Eng.) a while ago.
Nowadays everybody is supposed to throw
something into the common stock-pot, so
this blue stocking is working among the
Belgian refugees in camp at Earl’s Court,
opening up to them the mysteries of the
English language.
Another Australian, Miss Ethel Tucker,
M.A., daughter of the Melbourne professor,
has lately won a First Class in the Classical
Tripos at Cambridge. It sounds awe-in-
spiring ; yet Miss Tucker is enjoying excel-
lent health, and means to put many more
stitches in her particular brand of stocking.
In the February issue of the Royal
Colonial Institute Journal secretary Boose
gives about three, pages to his recent
Australian tour. A guarded reference to
various Ladies’ Leagues the wandering
Boose encountered includes particular men-
tion of the Adelaide branch of the Victoria
League. The English reader will decide that
Australia is a land flowing with honey and
whisky, for the number of banquets and
smaller feasts mentioned by the traveller are
legion.
Captain Harold Peek, who belongs to a
Maitland family, has won a delicious pro-
mise from a Lancashire lass —Miss Mabel
Hacking, the only daughter of parents who
live at Ilenfield House in the manufacturing
county.
Ilayley Lever, the Adelaide artist who
has been on the other side for some years,
has got away with the Carnegie gold medal
for his picture. “Winter, St. Ives.” The
big canvas, painted from the artist’s own
doorstep, lias been on view at the National
Academy of Design in N’York.
Some of the exhibits for the Red Cross
stall at the Easter Show have a
tendency to under-rate the chills of
an English summer. Many of the Belgian
youngsters’ frocks are made of cottons suit-
able for our own sunshine. England, which,
like the north of France, doesn’t have its
summer properly aired till the end of June,
can do with lots of warm clothing for over
nine months in the year. In the Red Cross
show, one feature of the doll exhibits will
be miniature Belgian Nightingales in pale
grey robes, with red capes. They’re made
up as pincushions, and you can stab them
with a packetful of pins and they won’t
squeal.
Artist Watkins has just finished a large
portrait of ex-Minister for Education Car-
michael. It’s a good likeness; but the
most striking thing about it is the canopy of
figtree which rises behind the sitter —the
pale green ghost of the slaughtered Moreton
Bay herbage that used to shade the utter-
most end of Macquarie-street.
Mrs. Tom Raine is now the hon. caretaker
and organiser of the Belgian Babes Kit
Society, in place of Dr. Mary Booth. The
latter has resigned to take up other work,
and goes to England. Miss Raine is hon.
secretary at mother’s elbow.
Pianist Yvonne Leverrier (who is Mrs.
Chauvin in domestic life) and brother Frank,
K.C., are in mourning for their mother. The
lamp flickered out gently the other day, just
before it reached the 78th milestone.
Elsie Greene, a daughter of the late landra
wheat-grower, has caught the khaki, feyer.
She is working it off in a British Hospital
for Belgian and other wounded soldiers at
Southampton.
Mrs. Harry Chisholm and daughter Sheila
fled from London to Egypt a few weeks ago.
Young Chisholm was in an early crop of
Australian khaki that was larded on that
variegated patch.
Solicitor Whiting, of Sydney, recently un-
packed his baggage in London. With him is
his sister, Mrs. Chambers —wife of a de-
stroyer’s skipper who has been very busy
since the guns began to boom. The Sydney
lawyer has taken seriously to the goose-step
with the Inns of Court Corps.
Artist Thea Proctor keeps her pencils
sharpened for action in a Chelsea studio.
The handsome Mosman girl was one of the
exhibitors at a February show of the Modern
Society of Portrait Painters.
Yours affectionately,
VANDORIAN.

MELBOURNE CHATTER
Melbourne, March 29, 191 A
My Dear Yarrie, —
Belgian Flag Day hit Melbourne in the
right place and made it gush cash as Moses’
rock gushed water. It was a day of mad-
dened trams. (Melbourne trams and old
gentlemen have an extraordinary capacity
for fury.) People would stand in the way
of the venerable arks till they gnashed their
bells and so made a lane for themselves
through the crowds that listened to the auc-
tioneers who gabbled in the busiest thorough-
fares. The workaday folk who couldn’t afford
to loiter had to travel blocks out of their
way. Melba began the day by giving £l3 for
a threepenny flag. Then she mounted an
auction block and offered cigarettes at any old
price. A foolish rumor that the lady was
going to sing ran through the streets, and the
stampede to hear her under the worst condi-
tions for next-to-nothing was immense. The
long-handled parasols now carried by the
fashionables did considerable damage to eyes
and tempers. In a sudden hen-rush these
absurd things, carried crosswise at the slope,
are amongst the deadliest weapons known to
civilisation.
The Tivoli people went at the job for all
they were worth. They sang in the Block
for charity from 10 o’clock to six, and then,
for charity’s sake, knocked off. During the
wild hours of song a corset shop offered some
ducky pink body-armor for auction outside
their door, and dragged golden pounds from
the scrambling men. The real fun will be
when the owners give their sweet gifts away.
What women will do for love is nothing com-
pared with what they will do for corsets.
The highwaywomen were full of energy
and resource. They were rigorously restricted
to beats, and the ones that were allotted the
shady side of Collins-street nearly froze.
Lesly Madden had the Royal Bank corner to
herself, and was impressive in her Rule Bri-
tannia style; she was hung about with flags
of every size, and her hat was surmounted
by three puce-purple ostrich plumes like the
royal trade-mark of Wales. Lady Stanley
wore one of her hats, and drove
round the bazaar-like streets during the after-
noon, buying flags at hold-up places. Irma,
the daughter of the lath Leon Caron, was a
particular success in a cream and pink outfit
and a motor-car, wherefrom the pretty little
girl sang various national anthems with a
large, sweet voice, and sold Belgian flags at
auction. Starting in front of the newspaper
war-bulletin boards, she was subsequently in-
vited to the Stock Exchange. Her own col-
lection-box was worth £l3O odd at the end of
her toil, and there had been other boxes cir-
culating among her audiences. It was viva-
cious Irma’s day out.
The hand of sympathy goes out to A.D.C.
Fane and his pretty wife, who have just
had news from the Cold Country of the
death of one of their quartette of babes.
Troubles did not come singly in this case,
for Captain Fane has a bullet in his lung,
and his fa mil y acres have been comman-
deered for Defence purposes.
Vanda Clarke, of the rich Mount Schank
family, has said “Yes” to the devoted Nor-
man Hodges, who, you will remember, did a
little Gent-helping to pass the time while
Vanda was away on her “finishing” tour.
Now Norman is going to the war, and the
engagement and wedding-cards are fluttering
round together. The wedding is to happen
early in April. Vanda (how that name sug-
gests moving !) brought several moth-banquets
of clothes from foreign places, so she is not
likely to be bothered much in preparing her
trousseau.
As might have been expected, Vanda
Clarke’s engagment ring is_ a sparkling tri-
umph. It has gumleaves of small diamonds
surrounding two monster brilliants of the
size that can only be afforded by heiresses
and bookmakers.
The 50 artists who have given pictures to
be gambled for at five guineas each showed
their wares in the Upper Athenaeum for the
first time on Thursday. Lady Munro Fergu-
son got off a long and inspiring speech about
Red Cross and Art, while standing at a
central table directly in front of a huge
Teague painting of Queen Bess. Bess was
upholstered heavily in gorgeous gold velvet
and jewels; the vice-regal lady looked much
cooler in tussore, with a pink rose in her
tulle hat. Fox stood modestly at her Ex.’s
elbow, and a small child, with vivid red hair
decorated with a big blue bow, sat well in the
picture. I don’t know who the important kid
was. Perhaps she was a Belgian refugee on
exhibition. A long, sleek Gent. Help kept a
portrait-smile alight all the time while the
big organ in the Town Hall next door purred
away like the reawakened Sosh Tiger. All
the artistic High Lights were grouped in a
graceful semi-circle. Mrs. Edward Dyson
made a startling entry, with a black-velvet,
bonnet on her fair hair and a big red bow
on her parasol.
After the show her Ex. descended the
stairs with the air of a female conqueror,
and dived into a little grey motor with a gold
crown. The expensive contrivance immedi-
ately snapped its doors on her and rushed
her off on more Red Cross business.
Cecil, a son of Henry Berry, was married
the other day to Miss Merritt, a daughter
of Major Charlie Merritt, of Brighton. They
tried to do it quietly, but the marriage of
one of the important Berry clan couldn’t be
furtive no matter how craftily the partici-
pants strove. Later on Mrs. Merritt gave
a shivoo at the Francatelli to welcome her
daughter home from the mooning. A big-
crowd mangled their beautiful dresses
squeezing up the Francatelli steps to storm
the private breakfast-room. Mrs. Howard
Berry looked a superb vision in something
or other, and Mrs. Jack Scot Sharp was
dazzling in something else. Some Gibsons
from the Apple Island were also in the
friendly squash.
The young Cholmondeley lord who married
Bess Tobin, a Melbourne heiress, before
hurrying off to the war, has put into a
Boulogne hospital in a damaged condition.
He hopes to be about again and taking new
risks in the spring.
Gordon Chirnside, brother of the Ama-
zonian Gladys and son of the lady who is
now Mrs. Hodges, has been made A.D.C. to
General Birdwood, the Kitchener man who
is bossing the Australian troops in Egypt.
Of the pair, one rather expected to hear that
Gladys had a military job. The fine, upstand-
ing sister has always kept a solicitous look-
out for her rather delicate brother.
The Spowers, who live in Toorak and on
the Argus, have farewelled Alan, the only
son, who is going to Europe to volunteer his
services. He learnt how to stand in line
and form himself into a hollow square at
Geelong, where he got his first taste for
fire-eating as a Grammar School cadet.
One of these days Pattie Scott (who was
Pat. Lindsey Russell before marriage hap-
pened her) may produce a bright and sooth-
ing novel with some rale Irish color in it—
the sort that sells in Mayfair. The rushful
lady writes from London to a Melbourne
friend :
I’ve just finished two new books (unseotarian,
thank Ilivens!), and am off to Ireland for a whole
six weeks, to be the guest of the Countess of Clan-
earty at Garbally Castle, in the south-west country.
I should get some interesting- material The war
has smashed up a great many hopes and dreams of
author and authoress —hard luck for them! So far,
I haven’t suffered. Ward, Lock and Co. have about
trebled my earnings. My hubby has a prac-
tice here; also, a surgery in the sacred vicinity of
Harley-street. We’re living in Hyde Park—rather
charming, but threatened with bombs, etc. And
to think I once nearly fell in love with a German!
M.v hubby has smashed his left arm rather badly,
and that’s finished his chance of being trotted off
to France.
The rest of the letter contains complimen-
tary references to Australia, whither the
writer hopes to trip before Christmas. Hav-
ing- apparently wrestled with the demon of
sectarianism in her, and got the monster
down, Lindsey Russell ought to go ahead in
the light-satirical Avay. She has the pen of
the ready romancer and a fine contempt for
conventionalities.
Mrs. Henry Stead has motored over to
Sydney for a brief three-days’ visit to her
soldier brother. She has relatives by the
dozen in the fighting line, but this brother is
the only one she has been able to hug in
farewell.
The Wrixon dame’s reverend son-in-law,
Smith Macßain, is going off to the war on
soul-tending duty. He had his baptism of
fire (shellfire, not hellfire) in South Africa,
where, as shepherd to an Australian contin-
gent, he was voted a jolly good fellow by
his lambs.
You really cannot be too careful in cases
of this kind. A man got himself engaged to
a girl in a small Vic. township some weeks
back, and a few days ago he married her.
It was some wedding, as we say in the Low-
lands, and the little chapel was to be appro-
priately decorated with all the vegetables in
season. Judge the state_ of mind of the con-
tracting parties and their blood relations on
finding this legend set up conspicuously
above the pulpit: “Abandon hope all ye who
enter here!” The culprit pleaded good in-
tentions, but the fact remains that she, too,
had had a bid for the bridegroom.
General Public is an ungrateful boss.
After slogging away for months as secre-
tary to The Bungalow Art Union, Mary
Brenan is asked through the press various
questions such as _ “What became of ticket
02261 ?” But Miss Brenan doesn’t quail.
She has all the fine points of the art union
business at her fingers’ ends, having dealt
with numerous Druids’ galas under her late
father’s jurisdiction. After all, the proof
of success is the profit, and it is understood
that some £3400 will accrue.
Louise Dwyer, a daughter of old £ £
Smith, gave her Scotch husband a novel
birthday-present last week. Instead of buy-
ing him a box of cyanide cigars, she arranged
a motor picnic for 300 poor children and
took the many-happy-returns man out to
witness the rejoicings. He said it was the
best he’d ever had.
Fred Rowe’s daughter Jessie, who put up
her pigtail and went into grown-up dresses
in order to marry Mr. Richards, of Colombo
(first door on the right as you go in), is
over here for a holiday. She took a run
down to see mother, instead of having the
usual Kipling holiday in the hills. Her
husband bosses the steamy wireless station,
and is too often on duty to be much of a
home comfort at present.
The Carts and Kafts—no, no! The Arts
and Crafts, who are on the job in aid of the
Belgians, are quite cheerful about the pro-
spects of next week’s auction. May Vale
has given them an interesting gift for sale.
Ic is a souvenir of the first performance of
Barrie’s “Little Minister” in London, at
the Haymarket—a portfolio containing 17
sketches by Phil May.
Mrs. Tom Ledingham has always been
keen on helping the home for insolvent dogs.
However, this year the money is to be
diverted and sent along to the needy Bel-
gians. A bazaar is now being plotted, and
will happen (d.v.) on May 8 at a private
house in Toorak. Mrs. Ledingham has her
coach-house stuffed full of toys and art pro-
ducts for a special stall.
The zeal of Miss Nyulasy in laboring to
help the Belgians has been rewarded by
receiving appointment of Mistress of the
Ice-creams at a coming show where the
microbe of ptomaine will be the only guest
to receive the cold eye of disfavor. She is
also organising a patriotic bridge party,
whereat the winners, having been honorably
decorated with flags, will hand the losers’
money over to relief funds. This is a new
idea, and your Johanna hasn’t yet seen the
scheme in working order —but the effect is
said to be fearfully exciting.
Down at Hamilton and thereabouts, a
dusty country cousin tells me, even the
magpies are dying of drought. It isn’t
thirst they are perishing of, but hunger. Why
can’t the poor things come to town and live
on the superfluous afternoon cake-crumbs
their human sisters let fall?
Esther Patterson opened her picture show
on Wednesday in the Centreway, and had
such a crowd of feminine and other visitors
that the pictures were mostly blotted out.
(Art must always be counted socially success-
ful when it is obliterated.) Mrs. Andrew
Fisher arrived and brought a flattering mes-
sage of regret from Andrew, who was away
in Brisbane. Mrs. Pearce tried to look at
the paintings and mentioned that her Sena-
tor husband had promised to look in with a
cheque book on his return from Sydney. Mrs.
Josiah Thomas was another visitor. One
dame who bought on a wholesale scale took
a great fancy to a particular girl study, but
implored the young artist, as one generation
to another, to “please paint out that cigar-
ette !” Mrs. Dwyer could not put in an
appearance, but, like a dear woman, she sent
flowers and a moonstone pendant, for luck,
to the young artist.
Ruby Dixon, the singing girl from St.
Kilda, is to marry this week. The bride-
groom-elect is Roy Goodison, whose late
father used to deal in softgoods in Bendigo.
On Friday night Lloyt’s. the picture
people (who is really one people-—dentist
Arthur Russell) gathered an audience by
invitation for the first performance in the
new screen-palace next to the Theatre Royal
in Bourke-street. The place is as gorgeous
as you might expect, and Freddie Challings-
worth, the director —a vision in an evening
dress-suit of the Immaculate brand—made
proud remarks to the guests, and the guests
hadn’t any difficulty in dulv applauding
them.
At a recent function Mrs. Pickles, of Syd-
ney, the handsome mother of airman Stanley
Pickles, related proudly how her son fell
300 ft., broke his leg, came out of hospital in
only three weeks’ time, and at once resumed
his' job. This sort of triumph makes the
mothers of mere groundlings throw their
bonnets behind the piano and resolve never
to go tea-drinking again.
Reggie Power, who is Rupert Clarke’s
son-in-law as well as himself, has given up
the job of Master of the Melbourne Hounds.
I understand he intends to get away back
to his country acres arid wring the soil for
shillings until it screams for mercy. There
was another rumor that he was going to the
war; but that seems to have died away like
a summer breeze.
From “Rosna,” in London: —
Melbourne artist Dora Meeson Coates is one of the
officials who enrol and direct London’s women police
volunteers. The she-Robert gives two hours a day
to training and two more to duty in such places as
the chief of the Robertinas may direct. She isn’t
supposed to chase the bad burglar, or dog the
wily murderer, but to keep a friendly eye on women,
children and other incapabies. George Coates, Dora’s
husband, after serving as a special constable, is now
driving a motor ambulance in the great Bill-broking
business on the other side of the Channel.
The widow of the late Judge Butler, of Welling-
ton (M.L.), has just died here. The family came to
Britain four years ago, as the younger portion of
it had ambitions to attend to. The one son, who
has been studying the higher architecture, has turned
warrior and gone with the Seaforth Highlanders.
Second-daughter Marjory, after a year or so at the
Tree School of Dramatic Art, slipped into the pro-
fession by way of a provincial tour in Greek drama.
She also toured lately as Lady Wetherbv in “The
Walls of Jericho,” and Mrs. Rosmore in “The Lion
and the Mouse.”
Birmingham is suffering an invasion of mumming
Australians at the moment. (If you can’t talk in
war terms you’re no one these days.) W. S.
Percy has his own company playing “A Cold'
Douche,” while the panto, raging opposite contains
Fred Leslie, Ivy Shilling (who plays second boy as
well as principal dancer), Hope Charteris (princi-
pal girl), George Millar, and musical-director
Howard Carr. What more can any Birmingham
want ?
The hunting folk are likely to topple if
they start chasing the smelly animal as
usual at Easter. The going is now so hard
in the usual hunting districts that heavy
rains are needed to make the game worth
playing. If there is no rain, the animal will
have to be left alone or pursued by bailiffs
in cabs.
The Buchanan who married Miss Alawa
Robertson and all her possessions is one of
the glad sights of Melbourne these dull days.
He turns out in full Highland costume and
escorts liis wife to the door of her female
club of an afternoon. Then with his tribal
blanket over his shoulder the hare-kneed
hero marches away with imaginary pipers
squealing before him. It is all very splen-
did. but I really don’t know why he does it.
The women of the Repertory Theatre Club
are kept busy these days preparing for a
Belgian sale of gifts on April 9. This is an
addition to their tveekly Red Cross parties.
And, still unsatisfied, some members are
arranging entertainments for Broadmeadows
Camp. The Club, as a whole, is contem-
plating a public reading of Ibsen’s Peer
Gyn.t,” by Rose Quong, with Greig accom-
paniment played by Eleanor King. (Inter-
val for refreshments and congratulations.)
And now the knock-out! “The Trojan
Women,” by Euripides, is being set to music
especially for the Reps, by Marshall Hall 1
Most of the characters in this are women, so
you can imagine the excursions and alarms
that will precede the burst.
Yours sincerely,
JOHANNA.
“Albion”: “Vigilans” (B. 4/3/T5) is talk-
ing through his neck when he reckons that
Dick Stewart, manager of Mitchell Downs
station, drove two emus in a rickshaw dur-
ing the drought of 1900-2. The notorious
Dick never drove emus, but he often drove
a bullock and a mule harnessed together
in a buckboard.

A GOOD REMEDY FOR
SALLOW COMPLEXIONS.
Everyone may have a clear and bright
complexion, free from furrows or wrinkles, if
they will only take a little daily trouble in
the following manner : Buy some Puritol wax
from the chemist or draper, and apply every
night, lap a little cold water bn the face ten
times with the hands every morning, allow-
ing it to get thoroughly round the closed
eyes, and pinch the skin very gently across
all wrinkles. Puritol Wax Soap, which
leaves a fine film of wax on the skin, should
be used ; this acts as a protective during the
day. This treatment arouses the dormant
nerves and blood vessels, and undoubtedly
accounts for many of the clear complexions
so much admired by those who do not yet
know the secret.* t 3

POLITICAL
POINTS
Put in a few plain words, the judgment
of the High Court in the wheat case is that
trade between the States must be permitted
to pass free, but that any State has a per-
fect right to stop it.
Some good thing may yet be done by ex-
publican A. A. Farthing, semi-Ministerial
M.L.A. for East Melbourne. He has been
indicated as the possible bringer-in of a
Totalisator Bill when the long-loafing
Assembly assembles. Thanks to party gov-
ernment and fear of the wowsers, Labor
members plead that they can hardly be ex-
pected to introduce a Bill if anybody else
will. Liberalism is feeling the same qualms.
So, as Farthing is the nearest approach to
a professing Independent in the House, he
may be induced to do what dozens of others
would rush if they weren’t afraid of getting
the whiskers of their precious parties
singed.
Attorney-General Hall (N.S.W.), submit-
ting his State bakeries proposal to the kind
consideration of the people, explains that of
course the trade will be spot cash. Why?
Isn’t it a good thing to get into debt?
DER TAG
More about what may happen to the eyes
of Australia was let out the other day by
a bankrupt who stated that, at the age of
20, he opened shop as all optician in Sydney.
He had picked up something about the
business while in Perth, “and no qualifica-
tion is necessary to practise in Sydney .” He
“did well in the business; his turnover for
one year amounting to £2500.” It seems
about time that the State Government ful-
filled its promise to see that some qualifica-
tion is necessary.
A co-operative farm has been started at
Mordialloc (Vic.), under the auspices of the
Women’s Political Association. The Pank-
hurst miss is giving advice. So is Vida
Goldstein, as well as various other promi-
nent advertisers in the Political Woman
movement. The concern is run by a pound-
a-share association, and the farm-laboresses
are to receive “a small salary, with a
bonus.” Six women are already on the
small salaries. It is proposed to open a
central depQt for the sale of produce such
as eggs, onions, violets, tomato sauce, horse-
feed, pot-herbs, knitted socks and plum jam.
This, then, is the Pankhurst-Goldstein
scheme of salvation for women —small sal-
laries in the present and vague bonuses in
the future. The Bulletin seems somehow
to have heard of it before. In fact, it
seems to have heard of it associated with
bitter curses.
A DIFFERENT CRAFT.
STRANGER TO DISTRICT: “ 'Sense me callin
you brotherbut I see you're one of we.”
COUSIN JACK INHABITANT: "I'm what?”
S.T.D.: “ You're a Mason .”
C.J.I.: “ 'Ee's all wrong. I'm a hinjin
driver.”
The other day, while opening a new in-
fants’ school at Richmond, Victoria’s . Edu-
cation Minister Livingston also unveiled a
portrait of Robert Bell, a former scholar
who was killed in the Sydney-Emden action,
and expatiated on “the sacrifices we were
ail called on to make for the sake of the
Empire.” Then he added that he and his
fellow-Ministers favored increased education
facilities, but it “couldn’t be done out of
revenue. We must borrow.” Even the
portrait must have grinned.
The advocates of the totalisator believe
they can get a Bill through the Vic. Assem-
bly if all the Labor members vote for it;
so the bookmaker recognises that it is time
to get in somewhere where he can deal with
the Labor movement. It is only a coinci-
dence, of course, that at a recent meeting
of the Port Melbourne branch of the P.L.C.
the list of individuals proposed for member-
ship included the name of an energetic mem-
ber of the Bookmakers’ Association.
The dispatch of the Expeditionary forces
threatens a new problem, or the intensifica-
tion of an old one. Australia has always suf-
fered from an unequal balance between
sparsely-populated country areas and bloated
metropolitan districts, and the inequality
becomes more pronounced as the country dis-
tricts are drawn on to provide most of the
recruits. This would not matter much if the
cities were engaged chiefly in turning the pro-
duct of the country into manufactured goods ;
but a monstrous proportion of city people
are engaged in merely handling goods and
making them dearer without increasing their
value. The time may arrive when it will be
necessary to start a new campaign of enlist-
ment, and put men into training for work on
the land in order to keep the backbone of the
country from degenerating into a myth.
Cocks, M.L.A., an ex-Gaud Mayor of
Sydney, by virtue of that and his glossy tile
appeared before the Victorian Housing Com-
mission the other day and made some char-
acteristically Cock-and-bull remarks. The
gist of them was that the slum was right
enough; it was the slum dweller who was
wrong. “Get hold of him and make him
work.” said Cocks, who went on to lament
that the Sydney slum inhabitant is “unem-
ployable and a wastrel,” had “lost his self-
respect and didn’t care what happened.”
Having delivered himself of this ponderous
observation. Cocks went out to have a cigar
and forget that he hadn’t really touched the
problem; for the problem consists of the
enormous number of children who, as long
as there are slums, will grow up in their
foetid atmosphere, with scarcely a hope in
the world.
Peacock’s Greater Melbourne Bill follows
that of the departed Watt to a large extent,
but varies in one important point. It hands
over to the larger body control of tram-
w T ays, lighting, fire extinction, water supply,
sewerage, markets, rivers and creeks, parks,
abattoirs, etc., as in the earlier measure; but
as to the constitution of the Council, Pea-
cock divides the metropolis into 30 districts
of nearly equal population, and each is to
return one member on a one-ratepayer-one-
vote suffrage. This is less advanced than
it should be, but is far ahead of Watt’s
plural voting proposal. Possibly the near
approach of the reversion of the cable-tram
system may assist the Bill through Parlia-
ment ; but the equal suffrage principle will
first move the House of Fat Landlords to
tears of bitter woe.
What a shirker Propputy is! The shirk
that created the infamy of Hospital Satur-
day, and sent out a mob of young girls to
bandy jests with old and hardened sinners
in the street, in order that by cadging Willie
Smith’s loose coppers they might save
Propputy from paying for the upkeep of
hospitals, finds its parallel everywhere, and
nowhere more noticeably than in connection
with the war. Seventy-five per cent, of the
men who have gone to the front have no
attachment at all to Australia except the
very close and dear one of children; yet
they are willing to give their lives, while a
cheque for three figures is beyond the
patriotism of by far the most of the men
to whom Australia stands for a big income.
The Northern Territory proposal to ap-
point a couple of members of the House of
Reps, to keep in touch with things up there
and be special advocates, is on the lines of
one of the earliest movements towards Re-
sponsible Government made by N. S. Wales.
Just as the Territory feels that it is not
understood in the Federal House, N.S.W.
felt that it was neglected or misunderstood
in the British Parliament. Joseph Hume,
leader of the Radicals in the Commons, was
the first to suggest the appointment of some
member to look after N.S.W. interests.
Daniel O’Connell, as an alternative, sug-
gested that some prominent Australian
should be sent to England by the colonists,
and found a seat in the Commons. The
name of W. C. Wentworth was mentioned,
and O’Connell promised to provide him with
a seat for an Irish borough. At first Went-
worth was agreeable. Resolutions were
carried at public meetings in Sydney that
the deputy’s salary should be £lOOO a year,
paid out of colonial revenues; but Bourke,
at that time Governor, refused to allot
money for the purpose. Later, Wentworth
backed out, and Bulwer, an English M.P.,
was appointed. Bulwer was kept primed
with N.S.W. intelligence by the Sydney re-
formers, and Governor Bourke forwarded
petitions and other formal documents
through him. His services were of the high-
est value; but he was greatly impeded by
Edward McArthur, a son of McArthur, of
Camden, who, though not a member of Par-
liament, held an office in the Lord Chamber-
lain’s department, and was appointed by
the Sydney Tories to act as their mouth-
piece. The Northern Territory, starting off
like N.S.W., is likely to continue the analogy
by puzzling Parliament with contradictory
statements, for there are many Tories there
or thereabouts who want miles of freehold
and heaps of cheap labor.

THE MAN WHO'S GOING 10
SUFFER MOST.
Victoria’s Price of Foods Board has at
latest tackled the price of milk. It hasn’t
finished the job yet; hut what it doesn’t
seem to have noticed is that (1) the milk
market is quite unaffected by the war; and
(2) if it fixes the sum which the farmer
may demand for his cow-juice, it should be
equally its duty to say what he shall pay
for his fodder, seed oats and maize, manure,
implements, and. above all, land. The
Board tells the farmer what it considers
the utmost he may ask for wheat and butter
and milk. Does it think it would like to
tell the landowner the highest figure he
may ask for his acres? And if not, why not ?
The war is still raging; public feeling is
bitter against the Gerhog; very heavy penal-
ties are awaiting the man who is discovered
even attempting to trade with the enemy.
Yet Attorney-General Hughes says he has
in hand the prosecution of about a dozen
people who have been willing to take all
the risks. And about a dozen cases have
already been dealt with, and heavy fines
imposed. If this happens under present
conditions, what chance is there of stopping
the trade in German manufactures after the
war, except by a tariff much higher than
the goods have to climb over at present?
ANDREW FISHER AND THE DROUGHT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
In every instance a drought has been followed by
good seasons, improved flocks and herds, and pro-
ductivity generally. I have no doubt that Nature
will take the same steps after this dry spell.
—Andrew Fisher.
If your tanks are dry and your land is parched,
Don’t worry about it at all;
Keep your eyes aloft and your backbone starched —•
Next season the rain may fall.
Don’t think of the mortgage that soon falls due,
Or a season’s wasted toil;
llemember the green of the grass that grew
Years back on the same brown soil.
If the time is short and the danger near,
And our hosts are ill-prepared,
Don’t shake with alarm or blanch with fear,
For our flags are nicely aired,
And we talk of making a railway line
To carry to God-knows-where
The half-trained troops that we know will shine
In thle battle of Fool’s Despair.
Don’t think of the size of the foeman’s fist,
Or the weight of his marching boot;
If the worst befall we may still exist
In despite of rapine and loot;
For the times may change and we yet may stand
To wallop the foeman out,
And luck may ransom a wakened land
From, Fisher as well as drought.

SPORTING
NOTIONS
The simple faith of the punter is really
touching—-to McMoees. It rises superior to all con-
'-siderations of experience, to all the whispering
reminders of busted trust wafted down by the moan-
ing winds of the past. And so the fatuous crowd
which takes material for guidance at second-hand,
-and gives ready ear to the fugitive, elusive tip, is
rushing in as usual at the early doors with cash to
risk about this, that or the oilier nag for the Don-
caster and Svdnev Cup. The odds on offer are ruin-
ous, of course, but what matter ? Both events are on
paper as open as the Western plains; but, still,
what matter ? The crowd with money to burn is
readv to take the risk, and the children of Israel wax
fat and glad. For the Doncaster Wooralc, by brilliant
galloping in his work, rules at the moment of wilting
a pronounced favorite, Traquette having been deposed
from that position in consequence of her disappointing
display in the Rawson Stakes at Rosehill. Unless the
filly can greatly improve on that form next Saturday,
her chances in the big mile are worth nothing - . The
writer of this paragraph believes she will, and that
wherever Woorak is Traquette will be in front. The
race has, however, been almost invariably one ot
disaster to favorite popular selections. Not since
Wakeful’s year lias a favorite won, and in 25 years
the favorite has only landed the bacon twice. Spurn.
Flash of Steel, Giro and Jmshi, lower down in the
list of probable starters and on the wagering card,
look more likely than the heavily-burdened, shorter-
priced idols to furnish an investment a little less
blitheringly insane than most. On Ulva’s Isle money
has been consistently heaped for Sydney Cup. This
son of Positano has’ on the whole, shown fine track
’form, but one gallop late last week made many good
judges reflect that 9st. is a good, solid weight to
hump along over two miles, with Carlita, Moonbria
and Tan liter running behind. The Bulletin, weigh-
ing everything with strict detachment, goes bald-
headed with the tip that on the Doncaster and Cup
the general public will get it in the neck, while
Noses wins in a walk.
jc. * * *
“0.K.”: At time of writing five Victorian
possibles in the Sydney Cup arc interesting propo-
sitions, though not one of them has a commanding
chance in comparison with St. Spasa (who, as a
voung 4-year-old ought to have improved a lot since
he won the Metrop. ), Ulva’s Isle, Cisco and Carlita.
The Victorians are Hush Money, Onazer, Sheriff Muir.
Wallachia and Wishing Cap. The Wallace colt.
Wallachia, and the mare Hush Money are in the Don
caster Handicap as well, hut the breeding of the
one and the conformation of the other suggest that the
two-miles Cup will suit them better than the Don-
caster mile. Hush Money has always run as though
10 or 11 furlongs were as far as she cared to go, but
she is just the cut of a stayer, and if she shapes
only decently in the mile race she may still be worth
considering on Easter Monday.
“0.K.”: Although the colt is under sus-
picion of being a rogue, I would as lief take my
chance with Woorak as with anything else in the
Doncaster Handicap where the more sober-going
animals want a bit of luck to help them. Backers
of Woorak can at least hope that, with Derby weight
on his back, he may get away with the lead and
keep it to perhaps the finish. One thing is certain:
the colt has never met Traquette on such favorable
terms as in the Doncaster Handicap. The filly has
to give him 41b. instead of getting a sex allowance.
If I were bound to back an alliterative double I’d
take Woorak for the mile race and Wishing Cap for
Sydney Cup. The sturdy Victorian gee is nothing
if not a stayer. It isn’t the weight that will beat
him, but his slowness off the mark. In the last
two miles of the Australian Cup he must have been
giving Lempriere fully 75 yards start, yet he fin-
ished second. Given a muddy track and a fortunate
get-away, Wishing Cap might actually win the Syd-
ney Cup, though he rarely wins any sort of jace.
John Wren’s 2000-guinea purchase, Gar-
lin, started earning oats on Saturday by capture
of a handicap event at Hawkesbury, where, carrying
9st. 51b., he ran clean away from Royal Laddie,
Toast, Hobble Skirt and other useful goers. The
time given for the mile, lrnin. 39sec., suggests that
the watch was first away. Carlin was solidly backed
for the Doncaster last week, and after his win at
the Hawkesbury punters were busy bearing golden
offerings to Israel.

This paper arises from the ruins to
wearily remark that Fanny Duraek has broken
another record. The smash occurred at Newcastle
on Saturday, in the Ocean Baths, and the smashed
was the property of Miss Vera Neave (Eng.). Since
October 8. 1913, that young woman held the world’s
record of 7min. 52sec. over 500yds. Fanny, as before
said, has shattered it; hut she was good enough to
replace it hv one branded 7min. 32 3-ssec. Inci-
dentally, Miss Duraek will shortly show Uncle Sam
what sort of a salmon she is, provided arrangements
are made to preserve her amateur status during a
tour proposed by “Snowy” Baker’s agent (Unmack)
at San Francisco.

“Over”: The howl that lias arisen in
N. S. Wales and elsewhere in Australia against the
dullness of cricket has caused Ma’s Cricket Associa-
tion to hatch a clutch of schemes to shake some life
dnto the game, hut none of them are likely to per-
ceptibly improve matters. The experiment likely to
cause the most interest is that of lengthening the
over to eight balls. This will start next season if
The other States agree. The objection raised to this
‘is that it will be too hard on the bowlers. Maybe
it will on young or “rough” bowlers, but to the
'generality it should he a help, especially to the man
“on the job.” Still, it’s doubtful if ericket will he
“brightened” by its adoption. There’s no question
that play in Australia in 1914 was below standard,
hut it seems to me that in making that estimate the
critics overlook the fact that the public’s sporting
tastes, like many of its other tastes, are changing.
The stereotyped games that satisfied grea't-granfer
are going to receive a shock —-some of them have
already received it. Observe what happened to the
old Rugby game when League football sparkled into
■SN. S. Wales a few years ago! And see how baseball
is winning through to the front! The Australian, in
Short, is turning to the sports that suit his nature,
and cricket is bound to be made aware of the fact.
Tlie new system of reckoning the position
of teams in Sydney’s first-grade cricket competition
comes in for criticism. The end of the final of the
ordinary rounds showed that North Sydney and
Western Suburbs were together, with 65 points each,
although the former hail won four single innings
matches as against five won by the latter, each
winning two matches outright. Also, University and
Sydney, who were next, were likewise together with
60 points, the former having won six games (one
outright and five on one innings) and the latter four
games (three outright and one on one innings). The
team with bowlers who can get an opposing side out
quickly apparently scores a big advantage; but the
points allowed for draws and single-innings’ defeats
also count. Each match won outright is worth
three points; two are allowed for a single-innings
victor}'; and one and a half to each team when a
draw is plaved. It was anticipated that the big
advantage of' the full win would encourage fast play,
but it seems to foster slowness. Thus University,
with 331 to get on the opening of a second Saturday
against N. Sydney preferred to play for a safe draw
rather than risk “going for the runs,” which might
have been obtained. With a draw ’Varsity was
certain of playing in the A division for the next
round. And that’s how it turned out.
Canowindra (N.S.W.) is vociferously
cheering Stanley Kirkland, a youth who this season
has accumulated 1042 runs in 17 innings (five not
outs), an average of 56.83 per innings. There are
only three centuries in the list- —which tells of the
evenness of the plugging.
Most of the Vic. tennis players stayed on
in Adelaide for the local championships; also Rice
and Parker dropped in from Sydney, and the former
proved a little too good for all the local men. Rice
beat Fitchett (Vic.), 3 to 2 —a very close thing—
and Parker, 3 to 0, and won the final, 3 to 1, from
R. V. Thomas, who had beaten Roy Taylor, 3 to 0.
Rice and Taylor got together for the doubles, and
beat Raws (Vic.) and Thomas. The Vic. ladies were
altogether too good. It was Miss Waxman’s week out,
and she won from Miss Sharp (the holder) and Miss
Stewart, Vic. champion of only the other day. In a
first-class doubles handicap Clem Hill met Whitty in
the final. The batsman beat the bowler. Veterans
FANNY DURACK.
were prominent all the week. Even the champion
Rice is a veteran. Playing with their own sons as
partner were Roberts, Thomson, Hone, Rowe and
Fitchett —this last a Vic. inter-State pair, the junior
member of which gave Rice his hardest game of the
week. On the other hand, the new blood which S.A.
rather badly needs was seen in Schubert, a_ 14-year-old
who won not only the under-17 championship but
also, with a moderate handicap, two men’s events as
well.
N.S.W. Lawn Tennis Association is going
to be over-run with inter-State visitors this month.
Victoria, Tasmania and Queensland will each for-
ward a consignment for the Ma State champion-
ships. S. Aus. has not made up its mind, but its
inclinations are entirely favorable. A Maoriland
team is also expected. The proceeds of the inter-
state matches will give the Belgian Fund a lift.
Melbourne Argus (26/3/T5) : “Finishing
a game in this way is about as satisfactory as win-
ning a steeplechase after the opposing horses have
fallen at the jumps.” That was a reflection of the
paper after seeing Mrs. Brook’s method of winning
A class singles (Vic.) at croquet.
From first to last of 20 solid rounds at
Svdney Stadium on Saturday Albert Lloyd, a lithe,
sinewy iad who learned what he knows of stoush in
the tent of a boxing showman round the country
districts of N.S.W. and Queensland, showed the way
to Walter Coffey, a latelv-iniported U.S.A. middle-
weight. Coffey, who belongs to the Lippe kennel,
has in his kit a special punch—a low, driving blow
into the region where an opponent keeps his dinner.
He used it not long ago in various American cities
with great unpleasantness. This and a fine big heart
, he brought along to the Stadium, but in the stressful
hour which followed he somehow or other mis-
laid the thump. It was by virtue of a fine grit
alone that he weathered the storm. The endurance
of these Yanks is really remarkable. Coffey was so
continually punished that by the eighteenth round
he was practically done, but be kept gamely to his
task, and in. the twentieth, though so badly rattled
that his legs almost, refused their office, he came
on and saw the disturbance through. Lloyd, who
was making a first appearance in the ring, was vigor-
ously cheered, and some enthusiastic admirers found
themselves so elated by his win that they fell on his
neck and kissed him. But the applause for Coffey
was no less cordial. He certainly made a gallant
fight of it.
Lloyd’s showing, on the whole, was good. He
was much the faster of the two, the better boxer
and far the cleverer at close quarters. With training
—he has had very little —and intelligent instruction
he may yet go a long way. But he has several bad
habits in the ring', and a style that will certainly,
unless corrected, get him into serious trouble. Ilis
attitude is far too tense, with the result that his
deliveries lack power. Lloyd’s first business, there-
fore, is to learn how to box with freedom, to get
down off his toes and to use his head to think with.
Apparently he seems to imagine his cranium can
bo employed as a third hand, and he is not altogether
too scrupulous about the use of his elbow. Coffey'
felt the weight of the Australian’s head far too
often on Saturday. Unless Lloyd attends to these
matters with pious intention and considerably recon-
structs himself, then he can look forward to the
certainty of becoming as tiod-up as a draper’s parcel.
Being yet in the plastic stage—he is only' 21—and
having the physique and instinct for the game, the
immediate pursuit of scalps may advantageously be
postponed until he cures his defects.
* * * *
Coining events: Ees Darcy and Demlin;
Fritz Holland and Jeff Smith; Hardwick and Mick
King. Of these the first scarcely appears a very
judicious arrangement, for though Demlin is a plucky,
capable boxer, few people would expect to see him
cope successfully with Darcy. The engagement
between Holland and Smith, however, will be looked
forward to with anticipatory pleasure by followers of
biff. Holland has been rather unlucky in recent
appearances, but Smith’s reasons to quarrel with luck
have never been particularly substantial. After his
disturbance with Holland Smith will probably next
be matched with Darcy, the meeting lately arranged
having been broken off in consequence of a demand
from the American corner that adjudication should
be by a Board of Three instead of a single referee.
Brisbane was provided with another brief
and melancholy assault at the Stadium on Saturday
night, when Frank Ellis devoted some attention to
the late Joe Russell. The reception he was given
when he climbed into the ring was stirring enough to
make Joseph come back, if anything could; but
Joseph was too deceased. Ellis played round him
like a cat with a tortoise, excepting in the- third
round when he received some sour body dope. Early
in the fifth round Russell was passed a two-horse
clout on the cranium and went down; rose again;
was supplied with its twin ; down; up ; biff! Towel.
vc *' *
On the other hand, ivielbourne Stadium
had a 20-round show supplied by Messrs. John Wil-
liam (vulgarly known as “Jack”) Jannese, ex-ama-
teur bantamweight champion of Australia, and since
1913 a much-commended pro., and George Pearson.
Jannese, on points, had it all over the other high
contracting party, and if his weapons had been a
trifle more indelicate the K.O. would have thrilled
the congregation. Pearson was floored in the fifth
and seventh round, but managed to revive and go
the whole distance. He was greatly in arrears when
the balance-sheet was made up. * *
The seuliing-revival fever in N.S.W. has
abated, and only one item on the big list of pro-
bable matches is anything of a certainty. That is
the mixed double-sculls championship, which will be
paddled on April 24 between the Kemps (brother
and sister) and Pearces (brother and sister) for the
title. The Towns-Felton squabble about the stake
seems as interminable as the hoop of a beer-coffin;
Ben Thorough good and Billy Ripley are still sparring
for a tussle for the heavy-boat championship ; George
Jack and W. Paddon are in disagreement as to
where to hold their race; and other challenges are
hung out to dry.
As Felton doesn’t seem overwhelmed with
anxiety to row Charlie Towns for less than a £2OO
stake, the latter has cast his eye upon the bashful
William Webb, champion of Maoriland, whom Hannan
is trying to coax into clamping down the match ten-
tatively arranged between them for May on the
Wanganui. Towns is eager to race while the time
is ripe, and offers to take on Webb for a stake of
£l5O at Sydney, and allow him some small amount
for expenses, the difficulty is that discretion is the
better part of Webb.
Victoria and South Aus. Baseball Asso-
ciations have decided not to support the venture of
the N.S.W. Assoc, to bring out Stanford (U.S.A.)
’Varsity baseballers for a month’s jaunt in Australia
at a cost of £1650. That settles it.
* * * *
A hint as to the way baseball is creeping
into public favor in the Ma State is found in
the balance-sheet of the ’ball Association. The
credit balance was £ll6 better than in the 1914
season. For the coming session St. George will be
lifted into the senior division, and there are indica-
tions that the entries in the lower grade will be
more numerous than hitherto. The game appears to
have picked up a portion of the support which fell
away from the Rugby Union when that body’s power
of attraction was so heavily undermined by the
League. Also, the flatness of cricket during 1914-15
drove numerous people to seek distraction elsewhere,
and a considerable proportion of those not driven to
hard drink gave the diamond game a trial. Since
when they have used no other.
At the championship meeting of the Vic-
torian amateur athletes on Saturday an attempt was
made by R. H. Watson to break Thorpe’s (N.S.W.)
time for the 1000yds.—2min. 15 4-ssec. He con-
tinued to the far tape after winning a tear-away half-
mile, but failed to do better than 2min. 21sec. In
addition to the half-mile he won the quarter-mile
championship. The club championship at the meet-
ing was collected by University (21 points), fol-
lowed bv East Melbourne and Carlton (18), Caul-
field Tailyho (14), and St. Stephens (9).
J. O’Farrell, who defeated champion A. ,T.
McDonald for the 10-mile Victorian amateur cycling
championship recently, carried the colors of Eastern
Suburbs (Sydney) in the Dunlop inter-club premier-
ship last year. He is a youth who is likely to dis-
tinguish himself in the rush for Australian cham-
pionships. * * *
Even the .Flying Pieman’s record has
been fractured. Sixty-seven years ago that all-round
sport jumped 50 hurdles, 2ft. high and 10ft. apart,
in 6min. 25sec. ; collected singly 50 stones one yard
apart in 14 minutes; walked a mile in llmin.;
wheeled a cart half a mile in 1 llmin. At Bathurst,
during St. Patrick’s Day Sports, Frederick Jennings.
52 years of age, tore into the Pieman’s games for all
he was worth, with the result that the Flying party’s
reputation suffered by llmin. He was wal-
loped in every department—smin. 18sec. chopped off
his cart act, llmin. off his mile walk, 3min. 55sec.
off his hurdle stunt, and 30sec. off his velocity in
collecting rocks to bounce on Huns’ heads or some-
thing. In fact, his name in future will be the Mud
Pieman.

What is said to be the most exciting contest yet
seen on the Hunter River was a race in 22ft. water-
men’s skiffs between two local sculler;, W. Croese
and C. Maher, for a £2O stake. The distance was
about a mile and a half, and Croese lobbed home
first by a few feet.—Sydney Flying Squadron’s sea-
son for 18-footers closed. Swastika won the handicap
by a small margin from Boronia, Quibree, Enid and
Kismet in that order North Sydney XI. defeated
University outright; leading for championship; play
off with Western Suburbs ..Wall, for Balmain
against Middle Harbor, took eight for 18 and six for

Coming after liis recent displays of
hazards off the red, George Gray’s match with Steven-
son looked very like an ordinary gate-money game.
The side-wager of £5O was too small for words.
Gray has recovered his lost ‘’form,” and being able
to make breaks of 1000 and upwards with ivory
balls, he will always be suspected of playing light
with any English cueist who keeps close to him in
a game of 18,000 up. His mastery of the losing
hazard stroke from baulk gives him a crushing advan-
tage over the best of the artists who can beat him
at top-of-the-table play.. When Inman and others
beat him, months ago, he was all to pieces. He lacked
the nerve necessary for long-sustained efforts in the.
first half of the game, and naturally he was unable
to get going with his macliine-like stroke as the end
grew near, and his opponent was far ahead. But now
he should always have his opponent in trouble before
half the distance is covered. The man who has to
sit still and get cold whilst Grav makes three or
four hundred hazards in succession is practically
beaten. And Gray, when in fair form, can hardlv
fail to achieve one or more of these disheartening
breaks during the first week of a long match.
THE TRUTH
ABOUT INTERNAL LUBRICATION.
The public who have been using an
internal lubricant in the shape of some form
of mineral oil or petroleum jelly to relieve
constipation are finding out that this whole-
sale lubrication of their internal organs is
destroying one of Nature’s most vital fluids
■ —the bile. Nature finds its work being done
by a foreign agent, grows less and less active,
and at last ceases to put forth any effort.
Just as a strong arm put in a sling and
given no exercise becomes weak and useless,
so the continual lubrication of the internal
organs by mineral oils will surely weaken
and reduce the flow of bile. It destroys the
natural movement of the bowels, because it
supersedes the flow of the bile ; and, there-
fore, the taking of Liquid Paraffine in any
of its forms is a source of future danger to
anyone so foolish to be carried away by
what is nothing but a most unfortunate fad.
Again, there is an exceedingly important
feature in connection with the taking of
mineral oil in the system which many have
never given a thought to, and undesirable
results are certain to follow if this practice
is continued. Is there any doubt that the
cells of the stomach through which we draw
the elements of nutrition also draw and ab-
sorb into the system this mineral oil? There
is no doubt of this at all, and also the walls
of the intestines which are covered with the
lubricant absorbs this oil as well. The
entire internal. system is, therefore, absorb-
ing mineral properties foreign to the human
system —properties that cannot help, sustain
or nourish the body. Is there any medical
authority who values his reputation who
will say this is a wise or safe course to con-
tinue?
To put it as clearly as possible, the liver
can be compared to a big sponge full of
holes. It becomes covered over with a slimy
substance, and these holes or ducts, from
which the bile flows, become stopped up; con-
sequently the bile is forced back into the
system, producing two direct results: (a)
a derangement of the entire system, and (b)
constipation, because the bile cannot act on
the waste matter in the intestinal canal, and
it remains in the system. This is what is
commonly known as torpid liver. Something
is wanted to get at the cause —something
■ that will act on the liver and open up these
ducts. Not something that will simply carry
off the wmste in the system, leaving it in just
the same state to repeat over again just what
has taken place. No poisonous mineral pro-
duct will take the place of the bile given
each human being by an All-wise Creator to
carry the waste matter out of the system
and aid in the digestion and assimilation of
our food. People resorting to this mineral
oil —either in ignotance or not, and practi-
cally saying we have no further use for the
bile, we have something to relieve constipa-
tion, that is all we care —will pay for their
ignorance or impudence in thinking they can
improve on the Creator’s work.
Sometimes Nature only requires a little
assistance to get over an obstruction, and if
something is used to merely give that assist-
ance and not usurp all Nature’s functions
and take the entire operation out of Nature’s
hands, then valuable help is being rendered.
This is where the invaluable properties of
Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills are apparent.
They do not usurp Nature’s functions, de-
stroying all their natural activity, but when
Nature needs help to carry its often too
heavy burden, caused by over-eating and
drinking, then Dr. Morse’s Indian Root rills
assist Nature. They act on the stomach,
and, above all, on the liver, causing the
stopped-up ducts to release the flow of bile
that has been withheld. It is this flow of bile
that causes the bowels to act, and any remedy
that ignores this fact is causing damage to
the great human mechanism. It is the con-
stant and regular flow of bile that aids iu
the digestion and assimilation of food, and
when this flow ceases from any cause the
system at once is affected throughout, and
constipation, of course, is the inevitable
result. , _ ..
For nearlv a century Dr. Morses Indian
Root Pills have been in use as a remedy for
liver ailments. They get at the cause. They
open the ducts, and allow the bile to flow,
aiding and assisting Nature, not in any
degree superseding or weakening the natural
functions. A pill occasionally produces regu-
larity and good health, and. with reasonab e
care regarding overtaxing the digestive
organs with either food or drink, a healthy
condition can be maintained. This is the
secret of good health in man. woman and
child, and there is no getting away from it.
Any fad that is based on the principle that
it can take the piace of the bile is a fraud
and a danger, and should be
where it belongs—back into the oil tank fo
lubricating machinery, not into the human
system.*

( Poorness of Blood )
Pallor Depression Exhaustion
Be sure you take Iron ‘Jelloids’ when Anaemic.
In Anaemia the whole body suffers, because the rich red blood
Upon which the well-being of the whole body depends is lacking.
The system then becomes weakened and debilitated, the nerves
are starved, the heart is Overworked. The result is Lack of Energy,
Depression, Paleness of Lips and Cheeks, Breathlessness and
Exhaustion after slight Exertion. To remove these symptoms the
blood must be enriched and strengthened -and the simplest, most
pleasant and economical way to do this is to take Iron Jelloids.

THE SECRET OF A HAUNTED HOUSE.
Some years ago near Bendigo
I did halt on a country road
Prepared to camp like a weary tramp
Neath the roof of a worn abode,
That rookery old said a yokel Bold
Is haunted by noisy sounds,
Take my advice and you think twice
Tis a risk worth a thousand pounds.
Tis dueed rot I fear it not
Said I as I crossed the road,
Prepared to rest and make the best
Of a night in the accurst abode ;
In the front room I lay hushed in gloom
When aroused by a rattling sound
I struck a light and braced up to fight
The haunter who prowled around.
Like a silent thief I did softly creep
To fathom the mystery out
The cause of the din was a sheet of tin
In the roof a flapping about.
. ...O. Back: Not well enough done. . . .C. 8.: Weak
defence made weaker by versification. ... T.P.T.:
On the contrary, observe our respectful grief! We
lift our hats as the poem’s funeral passes.... Effie

I cannot brood another day!

T TAVE you ever stopped to consider what it has meant
to your nation—to Australia—at this time of war
to possess successful Manufacturing Industries ?
The possession of Small Arms and Ammunition Factories, Engineering and
Coach Works, Boot and Hat Factories, Woollen Mills, Jam and Biscuit
Factories, Meat Preserving Works, etc., has permitted the full equipment,
clothing and provisioning of the Largest Expeditionary Force which has
ever been transported across the seas from hemisphere to hemisphere. It
has enabled Australia, self-relying, and with pride, to make immediate
and practical expression of her loyalty to the Empire.
But the production of munitions of war has not measured the full value
to Australia of her manufacturing industries. The manufacture of Harves-
ters, Furniture, Pianos, Locomotives and the thousands of other goods made
in Australia, has assisted in the flow of commerce necessary to her military
and naval life.
The importation of cheap German goods has not assisted in the establish-
ment of these manufacturing industries. Nor has the importation of German
Pianos assisted in the development of Australia’s resources.
BEALE PIANOS AND BEALE PLAYER-PIANOS
are made in Australia, and afford direct employment to over 500 Austra-
lians. The capital employed in the business is entirely Australian, the
Directors and Managers are all British, and the few supplies required for
the factories—less than is required by any other factory in the world, except
two—are secured within the Empire or the countries of the Allies.
BEALE PIANOS AND BEALE PLAYER-PIANOS are specially
manufactured to suit Australian musical requirements, and over 21,000
customers testify to their quality and durability.

Adelaide’s electric trams were six years
old tliis month, the first line (to Kensing-
ton) having been opened in March, 1909.
The Trust, which represents the munici-
palities, claims that gross revenue has gone
up from £105,000 a year with horse-cars to
£329,000, and traffic from 13,000,000 passen-
gers to 43,000,000 ; also, that it has paid in-
terest on purchase money and put an adequate
£131,000 to sinking fund, and has a balance
in hand.
Bernhard Dernberg, one time German
Minister for the Colonies, asks in the North
American Review:—
Will it be believed that a nation that has been
constantly striving tor peace, has never expanded
except peacefully, and never acquired territory except
by treaty, would go wilfully and light-heartedly to
fight nearly the whole world?
If Dernberg considers that Hanover,
Schleswig-Holstein and Alsace-Lorraine were
acquired by peaceful expansion, the inva-
sion of France and Belgium would natu-
rally seem “strivings for peace.” What the
Belgian thinks of the matter may possibly
be different.
Taking over the bakery business of the
State, in the interests of the people, sounds
a fine, large enterprise, and it has its merits.
But numberless vote-catching schemes sug-
gest that hardly anybody will benefit outside
the metropolis. As with most other of this
Government’s boons, the city will get the
cheap bread, the country won’t. Supposing,
under present conditions, the Government
can bake and supply good loaves in Sydney
for, say, 3d., the result will be that resi-
dential sites within the cheap-bread area
will be in still greater demand (to the
greater glory of the landlord), while the
unserved outer districts will be more neg-
lected than ever. In short, the cursed con-
gestion policy will get another boost. This
isn’t an argument against eliminating waste
and giving the city cheaper bread. But it
is a reason why a really patriotic Govern-
ment should pay first attention to the
cheapening of bread and other necessaries
outside the Sydney area.
“Reka”: A very old and romantic page
of Maoriland’s early history has been under
scrutiny lately, as the second volume of
Robert McNab’s records nears publication.
Somewhere about 143 years ago the French
vessels Mascarin and Marquis de Castries,
commanded by Marion du Fresne, anchored
near Kororareka, in the Bay of Islands, and
pitched camp on Motorua, now called
Marion Island, where still can be seen the
remains of their smithy. Trouble arose with
the Maoris, and du Fresne and 26 of his
men were massacred. Crozet, du Fresne’s
lieutenant, wrote an account of the affair.
This French party formally annexed Maori-
land as a French colony, and buried on
Marion Island the records of the event. The
old account says:—
On the 12th July, 1772, we sent a bottle to be
buried on Marion Island, in which were enclosed the
Arms of France and a formal statement of the taking
possession of all this country, which was named
Austral-France. This bottle is 4ft. under the earth, at
57 paces from the edge of the sea, reckoning from
high water-mark, and at 10 paces from the little
stream. This bottle was buried with all necessary
precautions.
The buried bottle has been regarded as more
or less of a myth at the Bay of Islands,
but the patient, thorough-going McNab has
made several long and unsuccessful searches
for it. Workmen have dug and delved for
him in all likely and unlikely places, and
failed to find trace of it. The main trouble
is that nobody is able to locate the high
water-mark of 143 years ago, and there are
now two “little streams” in the historic bay.
Also, as nobody can quite judge another
man’s stride, and four feet underground 143
years ago may mean 10 feet to-day, the
bottle and its interesting contents are ex-
traordinarily elusive.
A Melbourne soft-goods firm has struck
what it doubtless considers a ’cute plan to
encourage recruiting. On the wall of each
department it has hung a card inquiring:
“What will you say when your son asks
you, ‘What did you do at the war, Daddy ?’”
The Bulletin doesn’t know what it may
be in this case. But presumably if the
youngsters of the daddies employed by one
firm ask the question, the daddies employed
by other firms will be asked it too. And
about three times out of four a truthful
answer would be: “I went on helping to
pile up profits for a firm which could have
bought a dozen motor-ambulances without
making much of a hole in its petty cash,
and yet didn’t give the nation as much as
would buy a wheelbarrow.”
“Jeames”: What anguish Wellington
would have suffered had he been alive to-day!
He held firmly to the view that England
could only be governed by aristocrats. As
old Gleig, who knew him well, put it: —
It was to the influence of an aristocracy, patriotic,
moderate and just, that England owed her superi-
ority over other nations. Secrets were never
betrayed in our public offices or in our embassies.
Why ? Because they were officered by gentlemen
who, unlike the officials of other were proof
against bribes. The English army was the best in
the world, not because Englishmen are braver or more
enduring than other races, but because the officers
of the English army are gentlemen.
Of those who are now at the head of
affairs, Asquith is the son of a solicitor who
was so poor that he could scarcely afford to
send his brilliant son to the City of London
School. Kitchener’s father was a half-pay
Irish colonel. Fisher has Cingalese blood
in his veins, and his male progenitor held a
commission in an obscure Scottish line
regiment. Haldane, who attends to most of
England’s law, is “self-made,” and so is
Isaacs, who looks after the rest of it.
French’s father was a retired naval captain,
of the sort that pervades Plymouth and
Portsmouth in shoals. He brought money
into the family by marrying an Eccles. And
then there is Lloyd George, not to mention
John Burns. None of these national heroes
was at a public school—an unthinkable lapse
as Wellington would have regarded it. It is
a blighting commentary on the. forecasts of
Toryism, that Britain, in the hands of the
middle classes, is more formidable than at
any time in history,

An Unusually Comfortable Car
OMFORT is one of the Over-
land’s most noticeable qualities.
It has been carefully and skilfully
provided in the Overland design.
The seats are wide and deep. The
seat-backs are high. The upholstery
is very thick, and is supported by
springs in which strength and elas-
ticity are perfectly balanced.
The wheel base is long-—ll 4 inches
(289.56 cm). The springs are excep-
tionally long. The rear springs are
underslung. Their wide opening
permits great freedom of motion, and
all shocks are absorbed over an area
so great that no unpleasant jars reach
the body. All this is possible because
practically every part of the Overland
is designed and made in the Willys-
Overland factories —under our own
supervision, by our own master work-
men.
To appreciate all of the Overland’s
comfort, you must experience it your-
self. You are invited to inspect the
Overland at the local show-rooms.

An all-British fabric,
refined and economical
“Viyella” has uses for every member of
the family, and is unequalled for
women’s blouses, nightdresses and
undergarments; men’s shirts and
pyjamas; children’s frocks, nightdresses
and underclothing.
“Viyella” is in delightful patterns —refined and pleasing. Its softness makes it
comfortable when worn next the skin; it does not irritate like ordinary flannels.
“Viyella” is extremely serviceable and wonderfully economical. It readily
absorbs the moisture of the body and radiates it away, thus preventing chills
when there are sudden changes in the weather. It has been awarded the cer-
tificate of the London Institute of Hygiene, and is a fabric of genuine quality.
All up-to-date storekeepers and drapers stock “Viyella.” See the name on the
selvedge. If unobtainable in your locality, write to us and we will give you the
address of the nearest retailer handling it. I. &E. Morley, 56 Market Street,

The final triumph of the inventor of the first successful multi-tone
Ear-phone. IF YOU ARE DEAF, this perfected instrument will enable
you to hear DISTINCTLY, PERFECTLY.

ing perfect hearing in all degrees of deafness.
The Mears Ear-phone is based on the microphonic sound-
reproducing principle. ' Highly sensitive and self-adjusting it .intensifies the faintest sounds to just
that degree required in ordinary conversation, or in the Church oir Lecture Hall. Comfortably carried

IN
BANANA LAND
Grandfather Barlow, rep. of the Denham
Government in the Leg. Council: —
I shall not go till I am kicked out.
Ex-Home Secretary Appel’s departing
words: —
It is not my nature to wait until I am kicked out.
Treasurer Barnes to a deputation :
If I am to be kicked out, it will be with a clean
conscience.
The boot seems to be always m the mind of
Bananaland’s Cabinet. Anticipatory of a
general kick-out in May?
In March of last year the French steamer
Saint Paul was claimed by David Jones
through one of his many Bananaland coastal
agents, Smith’s Rock, stationed just outside
Moreton Bay. Public outcry, roused the
Government, and it swore to light the dan-
gerous spot. After due consideration
(about seven months) two buoys were
ordered —from the other side of the .world.
Last week the first instalment- —four gas
cylinders—arrived from Norway ; also word
that the rest might turn up some time during
the year. Meanwhile the Bananaland coastal
skipper dodges rocks and prays for the quiet
life of the Dardanelles.
“Cleveland”: Boat drill, which a few
years ago was a lost art on our coasting
steamers, is steadily becoming more general.
I can remember when the call “Fire and
Boat Stations” was responded to by about
half the crew; but it didn’t much matter
that the other half Was away, as, the whole
show would be over in five minutes, while
Davy Jones smiled on and made arrange-
ments for the next batch. The days of
boats “froze” into the chocks with paint, of
rotten boat-falls, sails and sea-anchors, and
of rat-eaten oil bags, are passing, and the
man wdio pays a fancy price for the right
to stay on board a ship while she wallows
from one port to another has now a sport-
ing chance if anything happens and the
boats are requisitioned. The most per-
plexed person on board ship when boat-
stations are piped is “Sparks,” the wireless
ONCE BITTEN
GRINDER (with offensive candor): “Now, that there mower only [?] the graws. It

man. I was watching evolutions one day
while men were tumbling up out of the
bowels of the ship, and presently saw
Sparks, resplendent in gold braid, scurrying
about like a rabbit, and with only the faint-
est idea of what was expected of him. He
was obviously sending out S.O.S. when he
met a grimy trimmer, who was -expressing
his opinidh of the a whole proceedings. “I
say, old man,” Railed Sparks, “could you
tell me what I am expected to do?” “Do?”
said the trimmer. “Do? Why, you don’t do
nothin’. You’re one of the bloomin’ ’eroes,
and goes down with the crimson ship.”
Oliver Cromwell Roberts, from U.S.A.,
who has been experimenting in the des-
truction of prickly pear near Dulacca for
the past year or so, began blowing his arseni-
cal fumes at the enemy last January, and
has dealt with 4000 acres to date. There is no
doubt about the mass of the pear treated
being dead. The question is : What about
the little green shoots that spring up after-
wards? Roberts’s contention is that they
are killed by the fumes of acid released from
the dying parents, and that is the main
point to be settled before Queensland takes
itself across the road and buys itself a
drink.
Denham, hitherto well-pleasing in the wow-
sers’ eyes, is taking to language. He told
an astonished Sugar Association the other
day that he “sought to do what was right,
and for the rest he did not care a d— ; n.”
From d —n to blanky and is only a step,
and'a Premier who' blankies and s in
Brisbane is lost.

booting out the idea that we have ever had
oil-drillers in Australia before, says the men
Queensland knows were Canadian hot-air
water-drillers. “Manx” writes both wildly
and unfairly. They were water-well drillers;
but they were also oil-well drillers. Most
of those drilling back of “the Reach” in
the ’9o’s hailed from Petrolia. They in-
cluded the late George Fair, to whose per-
sistency and pluck Maoriland is indebted
for' the striking of oil in the Taranaki dis-
fcrict. As for Australian drilling appliances,
I worked on a Queensland-built rig 15 years
ago—a steel one—and it answered splen-
didly. The first well we put down with it
was 2800 ft. deep. That and subsequent
experiences satisfied me that we can build
as good plants as the Yankees can.
Queensland Labor-leader T. J. Ryan got
home a heavy punch on the Denham Admin-
istration the other day. He showed that
there are 406 pastoral leases in the State
with respect to which resumptions were due,
in some cases as far-back as 1902 —13 years
ago! ■ Also, he mentioned the existence of
1400 pastoral holdings from which resump-
tions might be made, but weren’t. For years
past it has been the usual thing for hundreds
of would-be selectors to spend time and money
in looking over the same block of land, and
then engaging in a struggle which only one
of them could win. If Denham wants people
to believe that his alleged policy of settling
people on the land is genuine, it looks as
though he’ll have to first convince them that
Ryan is a liar. To' so restrict the number
of blocks available on this side o'f the Never-
Never that an applicant is lucky if he wins
a ballot within six months isn’t exactly
likely to promote closer. settlement.
The Road to Kum.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
When was it that I took that road,
That Persian road at night—
I, part of one tall camel’s pack
That swayed from left to right?
Behind me was a bale of silks,
I guessed their crumpled sheen;
Before a sheaf of cinnamon,
And I was lashed between.
The sky was like a blind man’s face,
There was not any moon,
But still there lurked among the sands
The suns of afternoon.
Sweet was the tinkle of the bells,
No silent hour we had,
The night had set a music chain
Along the camel pad.
And as we rode towards the walls,
A deeper rhythm rang,
For somewhere in the dark below
A camel driver sang.
He wove a dream of languid eyes
Behind a glittering veil,
Of sated fingers, toying with.
The silks inside the bale.
He gemmed the dream with costly jars
Of priceless ambergris:
Of lashes that reveal a glance
As moving as a kiss.
And all the while along the path
Towards the palm-cowled wells
Tfipre was no breaking of the link
Of ceaseless camel bells.
I wonder when I went that way?
The Past is veiled and dumb —
Yet I could swear I took one night
The magic road to Ivum.
A part of one lean camel’s pack,
That swung to left and right.
Wfixn tms it that I went that road ,
That Persian road, at night 9
QTJEENSDAND.
M. FORREST.
QUEENSLAND GOSSIP.
Brisbane, March 27, 1915.
My Dear Tiiargomindaii,—
The newly-imported Governor-and her Ex.
made their first appearance at a local theatre
on Wednesday evening. “Fanny’s First
Play” was the dissipation.
Which reminds me that the Violet Paget
Co. (husband Hugh Buckler is at the Front
or thereabouts) is bidding us farewell.
Saturday will see the last appearance; then
south to Sydney town, where a season will
be managed by the energetic Violet at the
Little Theatre. On Tuesday Mrs. Fred
Barker hostessed a good-bye spread at Fin-
ney’s to the leading lady. The following
day Mrs. T. B. Steele presided over another
party, whereat our own Temple Pigott was
also regretfully good-byed.
Tea parties have been the relaxation of
the week. On Wednesday Mr. Nugent Wade
Brown nourished a couple of hundred friends
and cronies, in celebration of the marriage
of pretty daughter Christian to her chosen
Watts, who helps sheep to grdw khaki in
Central Queensland. Mrs. Guildford David-
son, formerly a Miss Wade Brown, helped
her father do the arduous hand-shaking,
while the bride hovered around in a pretty
blue hat and frock, the brighter for some
touches of deep red.
Miss Willcocks, of New Farm, who is to
be married to Dave Tait on April 7, was
tea-ed yesterday afternoon by Miss Evans, of
Ascot.
Mrs. Ralph Clifton and her daughter.
Mrs. Montefiore, were scheduled to depart
on Saturday for the Northern Rivers on
a motoring tour with young Ralph Clifton,
this being for him a jaunt preliminary to
one to the disturbance in Europe. If the
war ends before he has had sufficient excite-
ment, he is thinking of taking to flying at
one of the aviation schools.
The committee of the Queen Alexandra
Home has landed Lady Goold-Adams with
the hook baited “patroness.” At the annual
meeting this week Mrs. T. C. Abraham was
installed for another term as president.
The shrieks of way-back suburbia for tram
extensions rend the air ; but until the over-
worked track through Queen-street is sup-
plemented, the outlanders will cry in vain.
The tram co. recently got an order-in-coun-
cil empowering it to take enough of Adelaide-
street to build a double track, and the pro-
spect of actually realising the dream of a
better service so shocked the sensibilities of
the City grand-dads that they asked Premier
Denham to take back the slip of paper and
make confetti of it. They didn’t relish the
notion of being overlooked. Also they men-
tioned something about the widening of
Adelaide-street. If the newly-weds on the
fringe of the city waited for their trams till
the City Council gets to work on the widen-
ing they would put their grandchildren
into the first cars on the promised ex-
tensions. Anyway, Digby Denham looked
the aldermen straight in the eye and said
“The order n->ust stand.”
Yours affectionately,
AUSTRALIA JANE.
“Politicus”: Andrew Fisher’s great
strategic proposal to connect Port Augusta
and Brisbane has mis-fired; Queensland
hasn’t cottoned on to it, and Andrew’s own
ash-barrel has remained profoundly unaf-
fected. In these circumstances, with Tory
and Liberal papers hostile and Labor papers
indifferent, what’s the good of it? The
noise you heard just now was the plunk
the proposal made when Andrew threw it
out of the window.
“Rangan”: Brisbane Fire Brigades Act
dates back 33 years. It has not been touched
since. The existing regulations regarding
height, material, etc., of buildings, also
nature of stairways, windows, fire escapes,
etc., would suit a mining camp. Some day
the city will have a fire. Then the Govern-
ment will sit in the ashes along with the
two City Councils, and the regulations will
be revised with a piece of charcoal.
“Sergeant Major” calls attention: —
I’m putting the case of the citizen soldier who is
bumped out of his job by a “patriotic” employer,
A ease that will do as an instance was heard before
a Brisbane magistrate the other day, when Rhoades'
and Co., house furnishers, were proceeded against for
“having committed a breach of the Defence Act, in
that, while being the employer of Patrick Davies, a
member of the Citizen Forces of the Commonwealth,
they penalised Davies for having rendered the per-
sonal service required of him, by dismissing him
from his employment.” Some sort of a fight was
put up on the first day of the hearing of the case,
but on the second day the employer’s counsel came
along and pleaded guilty, and the P.M. said the
bill would be £2O. But it must have cost the
youngster as much as that in lost time; and why
should he suffer ? Somebody ought to recompense
him somehow. But as it is a tough job to find a
way which will be quite satisfactory, the first step
is to make the punishment so heavy that cases
won’t arise. A fine of £2O, including costs, won’t
do at all.


It is an easy thing to boast and
exaggerate, but it is not a Avise
tiling; that is why we never
claim for Malthoid anything we
cannot substantiate. We know
Malthoid—White Malthoid par-
ticularly—to be the most satisfac-
tory roofing on the market, and
we believe this because it will not
rust, leak, crack, chip-off, nor
blow off in a gale.

at
HERB are still a few people who ask : What is
Amiwnd ?
Amiwud is a reproduction of the Hardwoods
made in sheets (and also made in the weight
of thick paper) for inside decoration.
T
It is a perfedt reproduction. All the beauty of the
grain and the richness of the coloring are faithfully
reproduced.
You have the choice of several styles —Golden
Oak or Weathered Oak, Mahogany or Jenisero.
You can use it for the redecoration of old rooms
or in the building of new. It can be tacked on to
existing walls or diredtly on to the studs.
It can be had plain (without grain) for ceilings —
see how charming is the combination of panelled
plain ceiling with panelled grained walls in Mr.
Firkins’s residence, here pictured.
With the aid of Amiwud you
can get the refined effect of
Old World homes. You can
get that softness of finish so
much to be desired, and—this
is an important point—you can
get it at very small outlay.

Home-made Beauty Helps
and Money-saving Recipes.
By RITA MOYA.
It is quite impossible for me to give advice in these columns regarding the merits of
various preparations on the market. In general, my advice to women Who wish to retain,
or regain, their youthful appearance is to avoid the many unreliable, cheap, made-up pre-
parations. Nature provides many simple “beautifiers,” and the best results are obtained
from their use. You must not be disappointed if you experience a little trouble in obtain-
ing some of the ingredients mentioned below. They can all be obtained, however, from any
reliable chemist, and even if he does not happen to have them in stock he will gladly
obtain them for you at a few hours’ notice, if you insist—and you should insist. The
smart, dainty woman of to-day likes to know what she is using.
Sure Way of Permanently Removing
Superfluous usual hair removers
on the market I have found not at all satis-
factory. I recommend the following prepara-
tion. It is really wonderful in its action,
destroying hairs completely in a few moments.
Many women have merely a down on the arms
and face, and imagine they do not need a
hair remover. They hardly realise what a
wonderful difference there would be in their
appearance if this down, even light as it
may be, were, removed. Get at any good
chemist an ounce of pure powdered pheminol.
Mix a little of it into a paste with water and
apply it to the hair growths. Wash off after
two minutes and the hairs will have entirely
disappeared. A little non-greasy face cream
can then be applied with advantage.
Powder Not Necessary.—Few women know
that it is possible to give the complexion a
delightfully smooth, velvety appearance in a
few moments by the application of ordinary
cleminite. If you have no cleminite in the
house, get about an ounce from your chemist
and dissolve it in four tablespoonsful of cold
water. This lotion applied to the face, neck
or arms, with the finger tips, immediately
gives that peach-like bloom so much admired;
powder is not necessary, and the result lasts
all day long. For an evening in a hot ball-
room this recipe is unrivalled. You will not
get that greasy, shiny look so often seen after
a little exertion.
Natural Wavy Hair.—You hair will regain
its rich lustre and fluffy appearance if cleansed
occasionally with a mild shampoo. The very
best thing I know of for this purpose is plain
stallax, a teaspoonful of which dissolved in
a cup of hot water is sufficient for the thickest
growth of hair. Pure stallax, however, seems
rather expensive, as it is only sold in the
origma.l packages which cost half a crown,
on i. <l uan tity, however, is sufficient for 25 or
oO shampoos, so it really is most economical
in the long run. Dry, irritating or profusely
oily scalps are soon put in a healthy condi-
tion. and dull, brittle hair grows bright and
e\en in color, and will be ever so soft and
Huffy.
Hair Culture.—There is no excuse for falling
hair; no excuse for thin, sick hair, or bald
spots. No beauty of features can make up for
a distressing lack of hair growth, and the
formula which 1 purpose giving you will posi-
tively force the hair to grow. Mix about an
ounce of boranium in J-pint of bay rum,
shake the bottle well and allow it to stand for
half an hour, then add fpint of fresh cold
water and strain. Rub well into the scalp,
and in two weeks’ time look for the new
growth; you will not require a microscope to

To Renew Complexions without Cosmetics.
—lf the excessive user of cosmetics only
knew the impression her artificiality really
makes upon others, she would quickly seek
the means of gaining a natural complexion.
Let her acquire the mercolised wax habit, dis-
carding make-up entirely, and she will soon
have the kind of complexion that women envy
and men admire. It is so easy to get a
little mercojised wax from the chemist and
use it nightly like cold cream, washing it off
m the morning. Gradually the lifeless, soiled
outer cuticle peels off in tiny invisible flakes,
and in a week or so you have a brand new-
complexion, clear, soft, velvety and of girlish
color and texture. The treatment is so simple
harmless and marvellously effective the won-
der is that every woman whose skin is with-
ered and discolored has not already adopted it

I .C. ’: Victoria’s Fisheries Department
is conducting an inquiry into the habits and
religions and other customs of schnapper,
and to that end has caught some 600 young
ones, decorated them with silver medals, and
tossed them in the water again. The pub-
lic is expected to let the beasts go if they
are caught this year, but thereafter they
may be taken and fried in peace if the De-
partment is notified of the animal’s number
and the time and place where caught and
the size of him. It will be all instructive,
no doubt; but what the State really needs
is reliable information about the persons
who manipulate the schnapper after he is
snared; especially the method by which he
suddenly jumps from 6d. a bushel to ss. an

“Matey”: Casino (N.S.W.) butter-fac-
tory is experimenting with boxes made from
the local hoop pine in the hope of finding
a substitute for Maoriland white pine, which
is becoming scarce and expensive. No doubt
a measure of success will be gained if the
hoop pine is well seasoned and the boxes
stuffed only with butter which goes promptly
into Australian consumption. But if butter
for export is encased in the wood the, taint
will be there. Can’t somebody invent a
cheap and tasteless lacquer which could be
put on the inside of the boxes? Any old
timber would do then and the cow-coclcies
might be able to afford to pay their hands
another threepence or so a week.

The oyster season at the Bluff (M.L.)
opened recently and was marked by the
frequency of the bivalve. Prices were cut
from Bs. a sack to 6s. 6d. ; half-sacks, 4s.
This works out at less than one penny a
dozen, which should be good news for eaters
of M.L. oysters in Melbourne and Sydney.-
It may even prevent the Dago restaurant-
keeper from raising the price higher than
usual (Is. 6d. a plate) on “accounta da
war.”

“N. or M.”: There are some odd old busi-
ness signs still in Hobart, though the in-
evitable “Hole in the Wall” has long since
been filled up. The Bird in Hand, Maypole
and Dr. Syntax inns still survive and the
reconstructed Wheatsheaf nestles in the
midst of private houses. Other old pubs
are the Ship, Man of War, Sailors’ Rest
and Ye 01de» Steam Packet Inn, a queer
little drinkery by the Hunter’s Island
wharf, with its roof drawn down like a
sou’-wester. In the days of smuggling, its
position at the outlet of the creek was a
great asset. A boat could slip up quietly
under shadow of the banks and unload kegs
at the back door. The Steam Hammer is
another pub named when steam power was
a sufficiently new form of energy to be com-
mented on. Others include the Ocean
Child and the Duke of Wellington; and
Salamanca Place, near the wharves, has
its Rear Admiral Hornsby and Lord Rod-
ney. When I was a youngster Rodney, a
warlike figure, with cocked hat and drawn
sword, pranced across the front of the build-
ing named, in his honor. The sign, a huge
affair cut in either wood or sheet iron, has
since fbeen removed. The oddest and I
believe the oldest of Hobart’s pictorial signs,
the. Good Woman, remains in its old
olace. and the lady still has her head under
her arm.
*• * * *
“Rimu”: In these days of high prices for
meat and bread there ought to be some
means by which the fruit which abounds,
and which might still more abound if there
were encouragement for the growers, could
reach the tables of the people, not as a
Sunday treat or occasional luxury, but as a
regular article of diet. It is quite a usual
thing to find peaches, apricots and plums
sold retail at anything from four to 10 times
the price listed in the market report; and
even the market report is a poor indication
of the real return to the grower. Is there
any real difficulty about dealing with a mat-
ter of this kind? Laws have been passed
to prevent usury; why not pass laws to
limit the profits on pomegranates? Of course
fruit is a perishable commoditv and a decent
allowance must be made for losses ; but 100
per cent- might to be enough to cover every-
thing. Why not, then, simol.v enact that
any person who was proved to have sold
fruit at more than double the wholesale
market price should be liable to a fine of
£lOO for the first offence? The cost of a
second robbery might be £5OO, of a third
£lOOO, and anybody who was convicted a
fourth time might be stripped of all he pos-
sessed and stood naked in the street to eat
a case of over-rine tomatoes. Two or three
convictions would settle the matter. Fruit
would th°n be sold at a reasonable price,
and far from the r°t a il e rs being the losers
their turnover, would become so enormous
that they would wonder how they could
ever have imagined that the secret of the
fruit trade lay in charging prices nobody
could pay.

SYMPTOMS of KIDNEY TROUBLE
ARE YOU IN DANGER THROUGH
IGNORANCE?
Nearly all of our readers suffer from aches
and pains of some kind at one time or
another. Aches and pains very often mean
kidney troubles. Such symptoms as consti-
pation, backache, improper action of the
bowels, pains in muscles and points, nasty
taste in the mouth first thing in the morning,
swelling of the feet, cloudy urine, a general
feeling of weakness and irritability, back-
ache, all these are symptoms of kidney
trouble.
They are caused by the poisonous acid in
the blood which the kidneys should remove,
but they do not owing to their being in a
weak state.
To cure kidney trouble of any kind, you
must positively get rid of the cause —the
poisonous Uric Acid. Remember, to do this,
a real remedy must pass through the kidneys
and the bladder, and not through the bowels
as most kidney pills do. When you see the
urine change to a muddy, bluish color —a
feature which distinguishes De Witt’s Pills
from all others—you know beyond all doubt
that they have put their healing touch on
the right spot—the kidneys and the bladder.
A wonderful pill—-straight to the kidneys—
that is the reason why De Witt’s give such
amazingly quick relief every time. A per-
manent cure follows in almost every case.
DE WITT’S KIDNEY and BLADDER PILLS
can be obtained at any of the branches of
Washington. H. Soul, Pattinson & Co. Ltd.,
Sydney; Longmore’s The Melbourne Phar-
macy, Bourke - Street, Melbourne ; and all
leading chemists at 2s. 9d. and ss. 6d. per
large box. The ss. 6d. size is «wo and a half
times as large as the 2s. 9d. size, and con-
tains enough doses to last you three weeks.
Try your nearest chemist, but if you have
any difficulty in obtaining De Witt’s Pills
send the price of the package required to
either of the firms mentioned above, and the
goods will be sent by x’eturn, post free.*


FACE GREATLY
Suffered Twelve Months. Caused
Much Pain. Used Cuticura Soap
and Ointment. * Soon Healed..
Mullengandra, Via Albury, N. S. W.—
“For twelve months I suffered a great
deal with a rash. At first there appeared
on my face an itchy red patch which caused
me much pain and it disfigured my face
greatly. At first I thought that it was only
a rash but after a time the trouble became
so irritating that I was advised to try some
ointment. This I did but without success
and friends advised me to try different
ointments and lotions but none seemed to
do me any good.
“One day a friend advised me to try
Cuticura Soap to wash my face with. I got
the Cuticura Soap and also some Cuti-
cura Ointment and applied them as directed
in the Booklet and almost immediately
after using the Cuticura Soap and Cuticura
Ointment my face began to get better. So
I continued using them both and soon I
was completely cured of this nasty rash.
I still keep on using the Cuticura Soap and
I like it better than any other toilet soap."
(Signed) Miss Grace Black, May 11, 1914.
Samples Free by Post
Cuticura Soap and Ointment are world
favorites because so effective in restoring
the natural purity and beauty of the skin,
scalp, hair and hands when marred by un-
sightly conditions. They satisfy in purity,
delicacy and fragrance the most discrimi-
nating. Although Cuticura Soap and Cuti-
cura Ointment are sold by dealers through-
out the world, a liberal sample of each with
32-p. book on the treatment of the skin and
scalp will be sent free upon request, so that
if you wish you may try them before you
buy them. Address R. Towns & Co..

CATARRH CENTRES OF THE HEAD.
“ Knt-ar-ah" Treatment provides an enlarged
supply of medicated air to soothe and heal
these discharging surfaces.
THE MENACE OF
CATARRH!
There are few human ailments which create such
discomfort and misery as Catarrh —the mother of
all disease. It pursues you at work and at play;
it is with you everywhere, threatening Deafness,
Throat Diseases, Bronchitis, Asthma, Dyspepsia,
Neuritis and Consumption; making you down-
hearted, ruining your hopes, wrecking your life
and holding a weapon of greater suffering
always before you.
Those offensive discharges from the nose, the partial loss of
hearing, the irritating head-noises, the dry “ stopped-up ” feel-
ing in the nostrils, the constant sneezing, the husky throat, the
frequent headaches, the continual hawking and spitting to dislodge
the mucous secretions, the heavy tired feeling when you awake—
these symptoms are as nothing compared with the fact that you are
inviting the entry of some worse affliction if you neglect Catarrh.
Free to Sufferers.
To all who are afflicted with Catarrh in any form I offer a FREE
TRIAL of “ Kat-ar-ah ” Inhalant. It gives immediate relief to
the inflamed membranes, clears the head, nose, throat and
lungs, conveys health-giving, purifying and germ-destroying
medicated air to the affected parts and cleanses the nasal
passages of accumulated mucous. No matter how many remedies
you may have tried do not consider your case hopeless until
you have tried “ Kat-ar-ah ” Treatment.
When writing give your full name and address; he sure to
mention this paper, and enclose 3d. in stamps to cover cost of
postage. The Trial Bottle will be sent you by return mail,
together with a copy of my new and interesting booklet: “Catarrh
—its Cause, Symptoms and Treatment.” Send at once to

“Pen-al Servitude”: The Vic. Education
Department has made known its determina-
tion to have all books utilised in State
schools printed and published in Australia.
This is only consistency in a Protectionist
State, and let us hope it will serve to raise
publishers of Australian school books above
the necessity of cadging their material from
Australian authors, who, on the whole, are
rather less affluent than publishers are wont
to be. Every Australian writer of some
note has become familiar with the publisher’s
polite letter drawing the attention of William
Smith, Esq., litterateur, to the fact that “we
contemplate” compiling such-and-such a book
for use in the schools, and asking permission
to utilise extracts from his well-known writ-
ings. The gracious epistle always dwells
upon the honor and glory that will accrue to
Smith from appearing before so large an
audience in so fine a publication and in such
excellent company. The letter, too, conveys
the impression that Messrs. Barabbas and Co.
are in some way performing a duty to their
country and an act of charity to the people
in producing the book. I am represented in
six or eight books of this sort with verse and
stories, for which I never received a cent:
but long ago my delusion that Barabbas and
Co. gave away their books was ruthlessly
shattered. Perhaps now that the local pub-
lisher is to have a monopoly he will be in a
position to pay the local literary producer for
his wares, without running the risk of bring-
ing the house down about his ears.
“Y.Z.”: Have you noticed how many of
the hand-to-mouth papers are utilising old
goods as serviceable war material? In one
the other day I discovered a page group of
fat babies, long ago utilised to advertise
somebody’s Malted Meal for Inflating In-
fants. The title ran: “Foes the Germans
are fighting in Belgium.” Last week quite
a respectable weekly had a photograph of
a one-legged man labelled “Victim of Ger-
man atrocity.” lie happened to be a St.
Kilda acquaintance of mine who had lately
figured in a Stock Exchange fancy festival.
Another paper in an Australian capital is
using up a stock of old plates of the ruins
of ’Frisco after the great ’quake as samples
of wreckage left by the Huns. But the
cheekiest thing so far is a second-hand pro-
cess-block of a parade of draught mares at
Flemington show ground, labelled: “Artil-
lery horses for the Allies at Dixmude.”
* * * *
Another rolling-stone is on the move.
George Lee, of Melbourne Herald, has taken
his war experience to the Broad-
meadows Camp, and hopes to be among the
next lot to leave Australia, with intent to
put a head on the Sultan or some other repro-
bate.
The Mergenthaler Linotype Co., which
owns the largest machine-type business in
the world, is waxing very fat on the bones of
the solid old hand-comp. Last year it had a
profit of £615,000, and its assets now stand
at about five millions sterling. The wages of
the old hand-comp., which one time drifted
into 10,000 pubs, now go in a steady stream
down the one great sink.
The first job just-deceased Frank Bullen,
the novelist, had on the Australian coast
after quitting the whalers was that of lamp-
trimmer on the Helen McGregor, which used
to run to the Clarence. Some of his copy
fell into the Grafton paper.
* * *
From “The Oldest Inhabitant”: —
An interesting publication of a long past is the
Temperance Advocate, of 12 small pages, issued in
Sydney in 1840-1. It was edited by John Fairfax,
of Macquarie Place, Sydney, the proprietor, and
printed for and published by him “at the Herald
office, Lower George, Sydney.” .As a sub-title it had:
“The Australasian, Commercial and Agricultural Intel-
ligencer.” There is very little local matter in the num-
ber before me, beyond the advertisements, of which
there are 39. J. Reading, a relative of John Fairfax,
from whose family the present “Mr. James” got his
second name, advertises himself as at King-street,
where cards, circulars, billheads, etc., were printed,
and all the work of a jobbing office was done. Mrs.
Hordern, of 12 King-street, between Pitt and Castle-
reagh streets, has an advt. about “ladies’ and
children’s Tuscan and Dunstable hats and bonnets;
work boxes, dressing eases and writing desks.” To-
day the descendants of Mrs. Hordern and John Fair-
fax are rivals in wealth. None of the other adver-
tisers are remembered, and their signboards have
disappeared—worth remembering when you are
asked to join a company which proposes to pay big
money for the goodwill of a business which looks as
though it would go on for ever.
* * * *
A Sydney paper, which does its law report-
ing on the maniacal principle of one-man-
ten-jobs, has just had to part up £5OO and
costs for libelling a well-known business man
by putting him behind the spikes on charges
of embezzlement. The fact was that the busi-
ness man was the prosecutor; but a sweat-
ing roundsman fell over his weary feet and
took his paper with him. The system has
been a fairly expensive one so far, and one
of these bright days somebody with as good
a case as this plaintiff had will decline to
compromise, and then the system will be
more expensive than ever.
* * * *
“McNortli” : Two or three times lately I
have seen statements that the German how-
itzer shell makes a hole in the ground “big
enough to bury five horses.” This seems a
very unsatisfactory way of describing an
excavation. Few people have seen five dead
horses in one heap, and most of us have but
vague ideas of the size of the necessary
grave. I can find no mention of what sized
horses are used in measuring these holes,
and there is silence respecting the nature of
the soil shifted. Why not next time give
the approximate number of cubic yards dis-
placed? But if the ex-undertaker who is
responsible for the flowery touch will per-
sist in thinking of graves, it would be more
illuminating if in specifying the dimensions
he said it was big enough to bury a live
bookmaker (I never saw a dead ’un), or of
another that it would contain 10 wowsers,
or four goats, or a church, or a p.n. Then
we could go out with a foot-rule and get the
hang of things.

REXONA PROVES A FRIEND IN NEED.
Accidents, more or less serious, are always happening to one or another of every family. The
busy mother is not so careful of herself as she might be, and a cut or burn often results. The ever-
active children frequently hurt themselves, and come running home to show cut, bruise or black-
ened eye, and father comes from his work with a painful hurt or cut. All these injuries, not so very
serious in themselves, may become so if neglected, and it is just then that the mother welcomes a
really reliable remedy which is easily applied, and can be depended upon to heal quickly. Rexona
fills this need. There is no better treatment than to get a tin of Rexona, and apply this Rapid Healer
night and morning. First clean the sore with warm water, then apply a little Rexona, and protect
the wound from contact with the clothing with a soft bandage. The most troublesome sores will
heal under this treatment in a few days. The wise mother will always be prepared for emergencies
by keeping a pot of Rexona handy.

CURED ALL THE HOUSEHOLD.
“My little boy, aged four years,
was covered with sores on his face
and hands for six weeks,” writes
Mis. Maggie Morris, Eighth Street,
Bowden, S.A. “We could not get
them healed. His father also had
a very had sore hand; it was
caused hy the bricks and lime. It
was bad for a long time; he did
not know what to do, as he suf-
fered a great, deal with the pain.
The baby also had a very sore ear
for some months. We had tried
all kinds of ointments, but none
did them any good until we heard
of the new Ointment called
Rexona. We tried the little tin,
and found it very healing. Then
we got a large tin, which cured the
three sufferers in less than a week.
Rexona seems different to other
ointments; it is so and
does not irritate the wounds.”
Every Family Needs Rexona.
Rexona is a reliable remedy for all Eruptions and Irritations of the Skin, Eczema, Pimples, Sores,
Chilblains, Chapped Hands. Sciatica, Itching or Bleeding Piles. Cuts, Burns, Scalds, Bad Legs, Stings
of Insects, and all kinds of Inflammation. Rexona is sold only in triangular pots, at 1/6, and in
larger pots, containing nearly four times the quantity, at 3/-.

The Pale Apprentice.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
AT night he sits before the polished
board—
That table with the crooked, carven
legs,
lie brought from some outlandish Moorish
town, .
Almost I think he reached the rack for this.
They thought he was the Devil and a Jew,
\nd he is just the devil of a Jew,
Feels heat like I do, and growls at the cold,
And faith! cleans up his platter just as I,
lint grudges all the while his keep and mine.
And thus he wastes these haunted, twilight
hours,
When moths are in the poppy fields outside,
And the blurred ghosts of willows in the lake,
A sky of rare pale lemon overhead,
And the gold swimming luxury of the moon.
’Tis just because the moon is gold. I think
He sometimes glances at it round the blind,
But never hears the crickets how they call,
Nor the long, amorous lilt of nightingales.
Perhaps he loved a woman long ago,
Some black-eyed, bronze-curled, slender little
thing
With small, white breasts and most enticing
limbs,
Much as I love Nanette. Perhaps he, too,
Was an apprentice in a window seat,
Paid, with a long complaint, on Lady Day,
And beaten when required, or when he
dreamed
Too much of sloe-like eyes and copper curls
And little breasts, where he would like to
hang
A necklet made of that close-hoarded gold !
Gold! What is gold? That cold and clink-
ing stuff
That slides between his fingers every night.
It cannot bring the red blood to his veins,
Nor smooth one crease from his high,
wrinkled brow.
Nor steal the rheumatism from ‘his knees,
Nor give those lash-less lids, those claw-like
hands
The quality to move a wench’s heart.
Gold! He might buy a wanton for an hour,
But I misdoubt the harpy of them all
Could bear to stay an hour....for half his
gold!
The waxen candles shimmer in the board.
Deep toned it is, in some hard, brilliant wood.
Perhaps it was a worthy pedestal
Fashioned for squatting haunches of a god—
Perhaps its grain grew dark with human
blood
To buy a boon with screaming sacrifice.
I wonder who he cheated out of it.
I'll swear he never paid an honest price!
lie draws the shade across the window frame.
He will not let the laughing moonlight in,
Lest avaricious eye snould stealthily
Peer round the heavy russets of the blind,
And tell the hamlet, bringing cut-throats
here;
Or some crouched footpad, crawling ’mid the
weeds
Of our bleak garden, should grow 7 very bold
And who would fear the rusty blunderbuss
Or me, the slim apprentice, who is put
Down in the window seat, to mind his books ?
He’d look to wring my neck like some tame
fowl’s,
And scarce go timorous of the kestrel’s beak
In one who is the chattel of the Jew.
And then he’d enter, and with daggered hand
Strike in the nape of that thin, withered
neck,
A little doubtful of the spurt of blood
Since one would fancy water in his veins,
Stagnant at that. How he would run his
hands
(Perchance a trifle quicker by that blood)
Among those greedy piles of yellow gold!
And, creeping out the fox-like way he came,
Would seek the tavern and some cosy Moll
To help him to disburse ; while I belike
Would hide in haycock, or glide trembling
through
The grove of poplars to the spinney’s edge,
And beating with my fists against the pane
Would rouse the beadle and his ban-dog up,
With tale of robbery and murder vile.
Unless he caught me napping, trussed me
down,
And flung me with a rag-wad in my mouth
To wait my chance of rescue in the barn.
I warrant he would vanish by the dawn,
And take the smoky road to London town,
Lost with his Moll among the many roofs
And narrow streets and wild, rat-haunted
lanes.
Till ill-luck swings him high on Tyburn
tree,
Or draws a horrid reckoning with The Boot,
He would have had his hour. But I —not I,
Who do no more than turn the page of books
And hate their heavy clamps and old mil-
dews,
And spurn the slow insistence of the claim
Of gold that on a ringing surface fa 115....
There is a quaint bent weapon on the wall,
The handle arabesqued. I think at times
That I will take it down, and try to read
The deep inscription someone graved there-
on,
Oommemorating honorable war
Or quiet murder in a quiet house
(A place surrounded by faint, glimmering
fields,
A filled-in moat, where field mice squeak
and rim,
With connate cunning, from the feathered
owl.
That only leaves the ivy in the dark.
But has such monster eyes in golden rings
I’or finding small things quivering in the
hedge.)
A master’s murder by his servant done.
A pale apprentice, who sits night by night
In musty corners of old window seats.
And feels his heart strive like a bird, against
His shabby nankeen vest? To break away
And seek her small, round face, and be a
man?
And kiss her breasts to swelling, and her
mouth
To those denying, yet surrendering, words?
• - . .To promise her a silk chemise to wear.
A silver girdle, and a satin coat.
A pair of shoes with scarlet heels, the like
The Lady of the Manor used to flaunt
To chapel, when the Yuletide snows were
here
Before she disappeared in coach and four
With that tall, haughty lover out of Spain.
Leaving my lord a sword thrust in the back?
Why will my thought run ever on the way
A sharp point pricks an opening in the
flesh?
Young men bleed more than old. My lord
was young—
lias she forgotten, as the Spaniard’s trull,
How his blood made a puddle in the snow?
One spot of moonlight finds a tiny hole
In the dull russets of the faded blind.
It. is as bright and snaring as her eyes,
That small-faced, dimpled and demure
Nanette
Who wanders all alone, where primroses
Are like pale lanterns in the hushing grass.
Alone —but am / sure she is alone?
Only the pulsing of a rebel heart!
Only the clock and click of devil’s dice!
Dry as the rattle in a dying throat!
And think what this could bring me! Her,
'at least 1
Like women all, she dotes on pretty things.
A sterling coin, no matter how ’tis flung,
Will buy a man a cheap, loose mouth to
kiss.
But jewels (like the scales along the back
Of mountain dragon, issuing from his cave
And blowing sulphur fumes on hills sur-
prised )
And slipping chains, and dainty scented
shoon —
These things would buy Nanette. Her price
is high.
But there is gold enough to get it here.
He shuffles to the blind (did he misread
That spot,of moonshine for a robber’s eye?)
Tightens the cord, and stiffly bars the door;
Shuts out all help, should he by any chance
Squeal in his Death strife, like a strangling
rat.
Not once he turns to look at me. No fear
Of me, the cowed apprentice, comes to him.
So he creaks back into the wooden chair;
But in that moment, with no shield between,
With no worn velvet coat, no frayed cravat.
No twisted shape, no straw-like fringe of
hair,
1 saw the pools of light the gold heaps
made —
A ransom for a king, a white queen’s price—
And thus once more the song of imps begins.
The chorus of the damned, the chink of gold.
And through some crack in these grey-
lozenged panes
There drifts the passion-stimulus of flowers,
Of flowers that grow in grasses hushed and
long
To hide the fancies that might shame the
day.
If I should lift that weapon from the wall
Its resting place would be outlined in dust,
The dust of many lonely, hateful eves.
But once the thing was done, I could wipe
clean
The blade of stains that are more damp than
dust,
And place it there again so no one hnew.

SETTLING DOWN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I VERY woman is at heart a married
1 i woman. So is every man, though he
doesn’t know it till it is too late —
till he is married.
“This marriage business,” I murmured to
Babette, “is terribly worrying.”
We were in our engagement days, when
it was occasionally necessary to make a
remark between cuddles. Otherwise you
can’t tell exactly where one cuddle leaves
off and the other begins; and the statistics
get all muddled.
“Why?” Babette cooed dreamily, reluc-
tantly releasing her lips from my right eye.
“Look at all the married couples we know,
dear, and then recollect that we’re going to
get married ourselves. Doesn’t it make you
afraid?”
“Surely you don’t think that we’ll be like
them, do you ?”
“That’s what I’m afraid of. Look at the
Brown-Smiths. They’re perfectly happy;
the ideal marriage everybody calls it. They
adore each other. They’re wrapped up in
each other.”
“Well, so are we,” Babette reminded me.
“No people could be more wrapped up in
each other than we are now.”
There are several ways in which a nice
girl can sit on a man’s knee. Babette’s long
experience of sitting on male knees had
eliminated all the awkwardness of that posi-
tion. and her figure so adapted itself to the
pose that it required some ingenuity to
unwrap ourselves. On this occasion, I did
not try.
“But how obviously they love each other,”
I went on. “They’ve no time for anybody
but themselves. And how dull they are!”
“Frumps!” said Babette. “But we’ll never
be like them.”
“Still, look at the others. There’s the
Smith-Browns. They’ve been married only
three years, and you’d think they had been
born married. Their conversation consists
of married remarks—silly matrimonial jokes
that they understand, and nobody else does.
They haven’t an interest beyond their home.
And there are the Smith-Smiths and the
Brown-Browns —they’re all the same.”
“But you can’t compare them with us,”
Babette cried. “They’re just dull, conven-
tional people who’ve done the usual conven-
tional thing. To them marriage is just
marriage; but to us, dear, marriage is going
to be a continual adventure. They’ve all
settled down. That’s all. But we're never
going to settle down.”
I hopefully agreed with her; and we
settled down for a quarter of an hour.
“Fancy comparing us with that frumpy
lot!” Babette took advantage of the cramp
in my left leg to remark.
“And yet,” I said, “perhaps Mrs. Brown-
Smith made the same remark once.”
“Well, it all comes of settling down. And
I’m not going to settle down. I mean to be
just the same to you when I’m your wife as
I am now. And you must promise,” she
went on, “to be just the same to me when
you’re my husband.”
“All that, and more!” I said.
Babette kissed me. Sometimes Babette is
extraordinarily intelligent.
“We won’t be commonplace. Most wives
I know are just wives. They don’t take the

Backache and Kidney
Trouble.
TWO SYDNEY PEOPLE CURED.
Mr. W illiam Carroll, sen., ex-railway guard, 749 Harris
Street:, Pyrmont, says:— “Some time ago I strained
myself pushing some heavy trucks, and soon noticed the
effect in the small of my back. For three solid months
1 was unable to work ; I was laid up. I had a very lame
back and a dull pain through the loins and the kidneys,
and my secretions became unnatural and irregular. 1
consulted a doctor, who recommended Turkish baths;
but though I got a little ease, 1 could not work. I used
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills, and obtained wonderful
relief. I am so much better I can now do heavy work.
1 am firmly convinced that Doan’s Backache Kidney
Pills are a true kidney remedy, and I never fail to
recommend them among my friends.”
Fifteen years later Mr. Carroll confirms the above: —“I
have been quite free of backache and urinary trouble ever
since Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills cured me fifteen years
ago. My cure proves that Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills
are a thoroughly good remedy.”
Mrs. E. Thompson, 194 Pittwater Road, Manly, Sydney,
says:—“For years I suffered agony from backache and
lumbago. I was so bad that I could scarcely get about,
and always felt tired, languid and depressed. Other
symptoms which clearly showed my kidneys were very
much out of order were headaches, dizziness, and irregular
secretions. I tried many different remedies, which were
supposed to cure kidney trouble, but derived no benefit
from them. At last I decided to try Doan’s Backache
Kidney Pills, and only wish I had got them long before;
they would have saved me a lot of pain. After taking a
couple of bottles I felt ever so much better, so I con-
tinued using the rills until I was quite cured. I think it
marvellous that Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills have
cured me so thoroughly. It is eight years since I was
cured, and I have been well ever since.”
Mrs. Thompson confirms the above, two years later: “I
am still well, and have had no return of backache and
lumbago since Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills cured me
ten years ago.”

Backache
Kidney
I
slightest interest in their husband’s business.
And look how I love to hear all about your
work!”
My business was —and .still is—to dictate
a series of business letters concerning but-
tons. The firm in whose office I occupy a
responsible post manufactures buttons. It
makes other things, too, like hooks and
eyes; but my department is devoted
solely to buttons. I served my apprentice-
ship as a junior clerk in the button depart-
ment of the office; and gradually as I ex-
tended my knowledge I rose to my present
position. This is the age of specialisation ;
and, though I had chances to go in the hook-
and-eye selling department, I sternly re-
fused to consider them, A man who knows
buttons as I know them will always com-
mand a steady salary.
And in those engagement days I used to
fill in the necessary pauses between more
serious preoccupations with information
upon buttons. It was a subject that appealed
to Babette’s woman’s heart. She grew quite
romantic.
“It brings us so close together, doesn’t it?”
she used to exclaim, forgetting that no button
Could have brought us closer than we usually
were.
“And when we’re really married,” she
went enthusiastically on, “you must take me
to your office. I’d love to see the place
where you toil all day, so that I could pic-
ture you slaving away for little me when
I'm at home by myself. And I could go as
your wife, couldn’t I, even in office hours?
And you must show me your desk where
you dictate your clerver letters. And you
must tell me all about the clerks —is she fair
.or dark?”
“Who?”
“The woman you dictate your letters to.”
“Oh, her ! I’ve never noticed. Something
mousey or mud-color, I think. But if you
like, I’ll look carefully to-morrow, aud let
you know.”
“Oh, no; you needn’t,” Babette hastily
answered. “If she saw you looking at her,
she might think you were interested in her.”
“Interested in her, when I’ve got you !” I
bundled.
But, nevertheless, I was interested. She
had quite a nice mouth and chin, I found.
So, two inexperienced navigators, who
knew less of each other than they did of the
great ocean they were about to explore, we
planned and perfected our equipment. In
our frail new boat we—with our beautiful
innocence and our glorious confidence—were
going to avoid the shoals on which, all
around our horizon, other ships as badly
found and as incompetently captained, had
run hopelessly aground. But in our few in-
tervals of sanity—even engaged couples have
such fleeting intervals —when he is wonder-
ing, at the street corner why she is so late, or
when she is wearying because he has not
written—in these few intervals Fear bat-
tened on our dear hopes. So many millions
of ships had as bravely set sail, and though
we found few that had gone to the bottom,
broken in two on some cruel reef (like a
chorus-girl or a lodger), many were ashore
in the mud (breakfast 305 times a year),
many becalmed (afternoon-teas and bridge),
and some so covered by the barnacles of
dullness that they would assuredly never
reach port.
Yet, with all these sailings in the past,
surely we had ourselves some inherited in-
stinct that would guide us aright?
Bravely, through the mist ot confetti, we
started off! Those first cosy evenings, after
we had crossed the bar of the honeymoon,
when sitting in our drawing-room, Babette,
mv wife, told me so humorously of her diffi-
culties with her maids ! We kept only one
—one at a time : the plural justifies itself.
And she would sit, just as I had pictured her,
daintily darning my socks, while I smoked
the new pipe she had chosen for me—in the
privacy of our home was the only place
where I could smoke it without causing an
obstruction of the footpath—and told her the
most thrilling of the events of my day at the
office. Sometimes I brought home to her
copies of letters that I had dictated about
buttons. One of them Babette insisted on
keeping. She thought the phraseology so
beautiful.
In the intervals between maids, I used to
help Babette to wash up the dinner-things.
How we enjoyed that picnicking, as we called
it. in the scullery ! And what fun we had
over Babette’s cooking, and how clever she
was always to have a stock of tinned herrings
to fall back upon !
Then one night when I came home tired
out with a big order for buttons, and found
that my dinner wouldn’t be ready for an
hour, I admit I got rather irritable, and
sharply asked Babette. why she could not
manage to keep her maids more than a week
at a time? She remarked that I was a
brute. I mentioned that if I could manage
my department of the office so capably, why
couldn’t she manage one maid? And she
informed me that she didn’t ever want to
hear another word about nr, tin-pot office.
The washing-up that night wasn’t at all
like a picnic.
We made it up, of course, in the double-
bed. But after that, I found that Babette
wasn’t in the least interested in the button
trade, and that her enthusiasm for darning
my socks had been transferred to her own
hats.
There was, therefore, nothing for me to do
but to refuse to discuss my business affairs
with my wife, and to take up a book when
Babette began upon hats.
“I was thinking,” Babette remarked one
night, “we don’t entertain enough. Suppose
we ask the Brown-Smiths down to dine some
evening, and we could have a little game of
bridge afterwards? Our evenings, with just
you and me, are so dull, aren’t they?”
“The Brown-Smiths!” I echoed. “But
they’re so horribly married.”
“Well, so are we.”
“Are we?” I asked in dismay. Looking
back at that evening—which was just like
any other evening—I had to admit that
Babette was right. “But we were going to
be so different,”l reminded her.
“It’s no use,” Babette sighed. “We can’t.
Nobody can. If you’re married, you’re mar-
ried, and that’s the end of it —and of you.
I’ve tried to keep up -with my old girl
friends —we were such friends before you
married me” —Babette almost accused me of
marrying her —“but I can’t get really inti-
mate with an unmarried girl. They’re so
ignorant and so —so romantic. They look
on men as if they were something super-
human. Why, Elsie Janaway looks up to
you as if you were a god ! Fancy! I used
to think her so sensible. And there are so
many subjects that you can’t discuss with
unmarried girls, and so many stories that
you’ve got to explain the point of to them.
I feel like a teacher in a Sunday-school.”
This set me thinking. Looking over my
friends I found that I had rather lost inter-
est in the unmarried ones. They seemed,
these young fellows, so irresponsible, so
happy-hearted, so free! And they looked on
girls, too, with a curious admiration mixed
with an incomprehensible awe. Now, there
is nothing awesome or specially admirable in
women—even Babette, I had gradually dis-
covered, was in many ways, just a woman.
“Yes, marriage does open your eyes,”
Babette went on. “I used to think. Mrs.
Brown-Smith hopelessly stodgy, but now
I find 1 get on with her so well. There’s
so many things we have to talk about —com-
paring husbands. Every married woman
is interesting as soon as you start compar-
ing husbands. And you soon find out that,
no matter how different you thought your
husband from all the other husbands, all hus-
bands are the same husband. All we women
are married to the same man. I think it is
that —the fact that we’re all of the same
family—that brings us together. You like
Mr. Brown-Smith, don’t you?”
The curious thing was that I did like him.
I had found in him, once I got to know him,
that comprehension of wives that I found
nowhere in the ranks of my unmarried
friends. For one thing, he didn’t treat wives
as a joke. Not that Brown-Smith hadn’t
a sense of humor. Some of his jokes about
marriage were excruciating. The chief ad-
vantage of marriage is that a husband is
always sure of finding someone who hasn’t
heard the latest—or, if she has, it has been
femininely bowdlerised. And there is
nothing in unmarried life like the camara-
derie of knowing that your friend’s wife has
hear'i the latest you told her husband at
lunch-time.
I did like Brown-Smith. So we lay dis-
cussing the. question of asking the Brown-
Smiths to dine. And when he had definitely
decided to join the lost legion, we merely
turned our backs and settled down to go to
sleep.
Suddenly Babette sat up in bed. “Henry,”
she tragically exclaimed, “we’ve settled down
—like all the rest of them!”
I was nearly asleep. T half-turned my
face. In the diffused milky white of the
moonlight outside, filtering through our
blinds, I saw Babette faintly white, a vague
vision of lace and loose hair, leaning over
me. I felt the rich warmth of her bosom
on my shoulder. I felt her mournful eyes
on mine.
“Well.” I grunted, “there’s no need for
you to wake me up when I was just off to
sleep to tell me that! Good night, dear.”
And I turned over and settled down ; and
Babette, that miracle of loveliness and love,
turned over too and settled down; and after
I had gently shoved her over to her half of
the double bed —-she’s always sneaking more
than her share—we went tranquilly to sleep.

About Nightmares.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
1 LOOKED over the palings, and saw
that they were nightmares.
There was a whole drove of them,
feeding on toadstools and dried spiders and
the herb mandragore. They were guarded
by a melancholy-looking basilisk, who wore
green spectacles.
“I do have the most fearful trouble with
them,” he said, when he heard me cough.
“But it’s little to what the night stallions
give me when I’m on that job. I once had
to look after Pegasus, but he was nothing
to them. I just kept his wings clipped once
a fortnight regular, and that held him inside
his fences. I got good pickings out of that
game too, retailing his pin feathers to the
female angels for bookmakers to use on
choir days. Though lie did roar a bit at
clipping time. But those there night stal-
lions, you can’t cut their wings, because
they’re leather-like, and it would hurt them,
so that the Overseer’d be on to me like a
gross of thunderbolts. There’s no holding
the creatures, and at branding time they
fair give me the scarlet horrors. The other
day one of the boundary riders lets a broken
paling go, and there they were, the whole
pack of them, out and in among the true
dreams, and next season there was the Old
Man to pay, and no mistake. Half of every
consignment of dreams sent down was mixed
like—crossed, you see —and Dfeere was so
many complaints sent in I near lost my job.
Three archbishops and a cardinal that had
been ordered pleasant hack-dreams for bed
exercise woke howling of hell fire, and I
was bit by one myself that fair turned my
hair grey and give me boils. • I’d ha’ got
over that, only a little peasant girl (Pippa
they called her) was so badly thrown by
one of these here night brumbies, as you
might call them, that she was translated.
She was on the right side of the ledger, of
course —just my luck —so they made her a
cherub, and no sooner was she through the
ivory gate and given her admittance ticket
than she goes and reports me to the Over-
seer. Then there was trouble.”
The poor old basilisk wiped his eyes with
a grimy, red-bordered pocket handkerchief,
and looked up at me, piteously.
“A shame,” I said, with sympathy.
The nightmares fed with a loud, champing
sound, snorting violet flame. They were of
all shapes, but the queer thing is that I
cannot remember one of them. Besides,
they changed each moment, sprouting fresh
teeth and claws and wings, as they ate and
moved.
There came a sudden stir amongst them.
“Thunder!” roared the basilisk. “If there
ain’t a paling down, and a seraphs’ tea-
party in the next paddock !”
The drove broke, and he after them, his
green beard waving, ns they poured in all
colored cascades across the boundary, and —
I dropped out of that land of dreams, and
woke.
