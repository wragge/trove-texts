Magere Bridge, in the heart of Amsterdam.
Have the time of your life in friendly,
fun-loving Amsterdam, the hub of Europe
(Fly to London via Amsterdam, enjoying KLM hospitality all the way)
If you fall in love with Amsterdam, you’re just normal. This city of
surprises is fun to visit. It is one of the cleanest cities in the world.
Its standard of living is high, but its cost of living is lower than almost
any other European city’s. Its national drink looks like water but
is surprisingly potent. Its people would rather speak English to
strangers than their own language. Add to all this the fact that
Amsterdam is a hub of European transportation routes and you’ll
see there are lots of good reasons for going there. Especially when
KLM can fly you all the way, hospitably, comfortably, reliably.
Amsterdam’s night life is gay and
sophisticated. You’ll find good jazz, good
dancing, good shows. Your entertainers may
be dressed in anything from feathers to furs.
But Amsterdam’s entertainment is not con-
fined to glittering night life. Amsterdam’s
Concertgebouw Orchestra is world-famous.
Dutch Ballet and the Dutch national theatre
perform in the Municipal Theatre on the
Leidseplein. The art lover will find Amster-
dam rich in art treasures.
Shopping in Amsterdam is sheer pleasure.
You’ll find well-known branded articles from
all over the world side by side with Dutch
quality goods. Prices are reasonable, choice
is staggering. Looking for souvenirs of your
visit, consider wooden shoes and Delft china
. . . crystal and porcelain . . . brass, pewter
and copper ware . . . Dutch cheeses, choco-
late and liqueurs. Also Amsterdam is a
world-renowned centre of diamond cutters
and one of Europe’s happiest hunting
grounds for the collector of antiques.
KLM can meet you with a car at any
of the airports it serves in Europe. But
drive-yourself rental rates at Amsterdam
Airport are lower than in any other Euro-
pean country. Your KLM office or Travel
Agent has full details.
It’s easy to reach the United States with
careful KLM. KLM offers you a choice of
32 Trans-Atlantitc jet flights a week, with
flights direct to New York, Houston and
Miami.
KLM flies to every continent, serves 44
cities in Europe alone. KLM operates the
world’s second-largest international air net-
work—l44,ooo unduplicated miles. Every
day, KLM uses about 60 aircraft to carry
some 4,000 passengers to their destinations.
Comfortably.
A KLM DC-8 intercontinental jet leaves
Sydney every Thursday at 10.45 a.m. Mel-
bourne passengers can make a same-day
connection comfortably.
Ask your Travel Agent to plan your tour.
With his professional know-how he can help
you make the most of your trip. Two of
every three KLM passengers are recom-
mended to fly KLM by experienced Travel
Agents.

TO THE
EDITOR
AN ARMY “COMEDY”
Sir,
I am the wife of an Army officer. I
have so far suffered Army conditions in
silence —as, no doubt, have thousands
of other Army wives—but an incident
of maladministration took place a few
days ago of such farcical proportions
that it was really worthy of Gilbert and
Sullivan, the principal difference being
that Gilbert and Sullivan were unable to
.use taxpayers' money to concoct comic
situations.
My husband recently requested that
his discharge be effected in our home
State of Queensland, his main reason
being that due to my ill-health this
would overcome certain difficulties. He
also pointed out that at present he is
suffering from acute fibrositis and that
a journey to Sydney at present would be
difficult. Both of these statements were
supported by medical certificates.
The Army deemed it unnecessary to
answer my husband's application and
came up with the brilliant solution of
employing a civilian ambulance to take
my husband to Sydney on the appointed
day, discharge him whilst lying on a
stretcher, as it were, and return him by
civilian ambulance (a total of 340 miles
—cost —?). Incidentally, the first thing
my husband knew of this was when a
civilian ambulance driver arrived outside
the home in a splendid vehicle to make
arrangements for the “mercy dash”.
Due to my being confined to my bed
for some days and our four children
needing to be taken care of, my husband
supplied the Army with another medi-
cal certificate, detailing my ailment,
which has postponed matters for a short
while. Given possibly a week to over-
come the current acute bout of fibrosi-
tis, my husband will be able to get about
again, but this would possibly interfere
with the Army's strategic plan for dis-
charge. Apart from this, no reason
has been suggested, nor can it be ima-
gined, why the Army cannot discharge
my husband where our home is situa-
ted and where my husband enlisted —in
Brisbane.
We read with increasing frequency
these days that members of the Army
are grasping the opportunity of dis-
charge at the earliest opportunity—and
that the Army is dwindling at an alarm-
ing rate. The solutions to this are givea

variously as increased pay, better pen-
sions, smarter uniforms or more oppor-
tunities for trades training. I feel sure,
however, that an impartial, i.e. non-
Army, investigation would reveal that
the main problem is one of morale.

THE INDONESIANS
Sir,
Commander Craster C. M. Usher
(13/6/64) is full of the spirit which
should have died long ago. Let us hope
that the spirit of Anzac is capable of
a more imaginative approach to its
neighbor than the Commander’s that
Java should be blockaded and Indonesia
fragmented.
I hope I never see the day when our
two peoples get closer to hostility than
they are today, but if that should arise,
I’m sure we can in truth accept a very
big part of the blame ourselves. We
need to know our neighbors better and
to understand their problems. To get to
know them is, as I have found, to love
them, because I have met in my in-
creasing contacts with Indonesians the
kind of people Australians can take to
their hearts.

MERGERS
Sir,
The discussion of the desirability of
company mergers by Mr E. L. Wheel-
wright and Mr Roger Randerson in
“Four Corners” on June 6 leaves some
room for comment. Most economists
are aware of the desirability of free
competition. Comments made by Mr
Randerson tend to contradict this view.
In the first instance, Mr Randerson
claimed that companies participating in
mergers in Australia are relatively small
by world standards. lam not question-
ing this view; however, I believe that in
many cases they are significantly large in
comparison with the size of the Aus-
tralian economy. It is this latter situa-
tion, and its effects on the public sector,
which concern us most here in Austra-
lia.
My second point concerns Mr Ran-
derson’s view that mergers may not
always be harmful to the public inter-
est. Indeed, this may be so. There may
be cases where mergers and restrictive
trade practices are beneficial in a deve-
loping economy. This is the type of
question which needs to be covered by
legislation.
Australia needs legislation as proposed
by Sir Garfield Barwick. Registration
of practices, agreements and certain
kinds of mergers is the only efficient way
of keeping some check on their effects
on the public interest. Objections to the
proposals is, in many cases, evidence that
undesirable practices are in existence.
The recent upward trend in take-
overs emphasises the need for action.
We should not feel that all mergers are
undesirable. However, it is only by
way of efficient legislation that we can
distinguish those which are likely to be
harmful.

SOKA GAKKAI
Sir,
S. T. Blackall's article, “Japan's Instant
Religion” (6/6/64), broadly described
the many facets of Soka Gakkai, at pre-
sent the most outstanding “new” reli-
gion in Japan. However, there are some
important facts that Mr Blackall did
not mention. These are:
That Soka Gakkai has considerable in-
fluence amongst the working class and
the trade unions;.the presence in Japan
of an intense and somewhat effective
opposition towards the religion by labor
organisations; the political arm of Soka
Gakkai, the Komei Kai, was only formed
after the 1962 elections. The party has
the third largest representation in the
Upper House; the possibility of seces-
sions within the religious group, due to
the conflict of the strong personalities of
some members; Soka Gakkai was reinsta-
ted after the last war because of the
people’s fear of Communist invasion
from the mainland. Hence, it is a crisis
religion.
There are also two errors. The prin-
ciple doctrine is jy hakiifuku , not shakti-
buku\ the opening of the Grand Kodo,
1958, was attended by over two million
people, not 200,000.

THE TALENT INDUSTRY
Sir,
Jn addition to a number of misstate-
ments in the article by Jan Smith headed
“The Talent Industry” (30/5/64), there
are quite a few conclusions one must
draw which automatically puts certain
sections of the article into the fairy-tale
class. Miss Smith says, “definitely they
(the ballet girls in a night club) were
underpaid at £lB plus a week”, and then
goes on to say: "Between shows there is
no rest. Most of them are speeding to
the suburbs in mini-minors or taxis they
can ill afford to squeeze in a second job
at the pubs and League clubs before
coming back for the second show at
11 or later.” Presumably the “squeezing
in a second job” also results in the girls
being further “underpaid at £lB plus”
for the second job, thus resulting in a
niggardly gross income of £39 per week!
Grossly underpaid? Particularly in view
of the fact that most are well under 21.
Their night’s work starts at 7 p.m.
(making up). It's all over by midnight
and off they go home in their mini-
minors or their ill-affordable taxis.
I don’t know who pulled Miss Smith’s
leg about the “strike” four years ago.
There just hasn't been any strike in Syd-
ney’s night-club land. The rules of
Actors and Announcers Equity Associa-
tion make no provisions for “fining” a
member for working with a non-member,
and no such fine has ever been imposed
upon a member. Miss Smith says
“theatre work pays the same rates”.
Theatre work doesn't pay the same rates.

When you choose industrial rubber products durability
is of prime importance. Illustrated are seven striking
examples of the lasting qualities of Goodyear products.
But that is only part of the story. The
choice of a Goodyear product may
begin with many other aspects of its
use: extreme temperature conditions;
the need to withstand prolonged ex-
posure to weather; an unusual use
calling for a special design.
Goodyear meets such demands with
unrivalled world-wide experience in
industrial rubber. It comes to you
through the G.T.M. (Goodyear Tech-
nical Man). He is trained to give you
immediate, expert advice on any pro-
blem, and he is as near as your tele-

but, by agreement with the union, they
may not “squeeze in a second job.” At
£25 per week for one show (one hour
long) nightly they are receiving in excess
of what many married tradesmen get.
In conclusion, despite the grim time
Miss Smith pictures the Sydney night-
club ballet girls as going through, she
then states —“There is a big waiting list
for club work”. Apparently quite a few
are ready to endure a 7 p.m. to midnight

STATE AID
Sir,
If our grandfathers, as E. K. Wargent
(30/5/64) claims, legislated against
“State aid” because “they realised the
dangers inherent in using public money
to aid denominational schools, so crea-
ting division and hostility between reli-
gious groups”, they were only wasting
their time. The religious differences in
Australian and other English-speaking
communities had already existed for
more than 300 years, since the days of
Luther and King Henry. All our grand-
fathers—or rather those secularists and
sectarianists among them—did was to
accentuate, aggravate and perpetuate
already existing divisions.
The bitterness engendered by the
“secular privilege” system here does not
exist in England and Scotland whose
governments help to build and maintain
all church schools and pay salaries to re-
ligious staff. The statesmen of those
countries, in contrast to our electorate-
scared politicians, apparently do not con-
sider that the question of separation of
Church and State is involved.
And it isn't involved—this issue is be-
tween the State and the parent. In a
pluralistic society like Australia, each
citizen—parent and child—is entitled to
equality of treatment from the public
purse to which all contribute equally
through taxation. Therefore, when pub-
lic money is spent on education each
child is entitled in justice to its share,
regardless of where it receives the secular
education compelled by the State.
Mr Wargent, who relies on Section
116 of the Federal Constitution to base
his present objection to the financial aid
which the Government has now granted
to non-State schools, may be interested
in an article in the Melbourne Univer-
sity’s Law Review (June, 1963) by Mr
C. L. Pannam, Senior Lecturer in Law
there. In it, Mr Pannam points out that
Section 116 (which does not mention
education or schools), far from prohibi-
ting aid to church schools, forbids the
establishment of any particular religion;
it is silent on the question of non-
preferential aid to religion in general.

“THE SPIRE”
Sir,
The central theme of William Gold-
ing's “The Spire” is the building, in
mediaeval times, of a spire on a cathe-
dral that has mud and clay beneath its
foundations. In his review (Red Page,
6/6/64), David Martin writes: “But a
tall spire cannot be built in a mud-hole;
it means the allegory is faulty and too
extreme. It would be foolish to imagine
that Golding is unaware of it.”
I imagine that Golding would be
aware that Salisbury Cathedral is built
on marshy meadow land. Its spire,
built between 1330 and 1360. still stands
—the tallest spire in England and reput-
ed to be the most beautiful in the world.
At the time of its building surely there
must have been some such conflict be-
tween faith and fear, religion and reason,
as Golding describes in his story, and
in the case of Salisbury Cathedral faith
seems to have won the judgment of the
centuries.

STERILISATION
Sir,
Dr Alan Guttmacher’s article on
sterilisation (30/5/64) was a fair and
informative review, but may we point
out that in NSW, at least, anyone seeking
this “excellent procedure” may encoun-
ter considerable difficulty. Legally,
there is no statutory provision whatever
regarding sterilisation, but the legality of
the operation is uncertain enough to
deter many doctors from performing it.
In addition, the Ethics Committee of the
NSW branch of the AMA has stated
that sterilisation is “unethical” unless
carried out for medical reasons.
Undoubtedly Catholics are forbidden
it by their religion, but, as Dr Gutt-
macher says, there is nothing in pro-
testant religious ethics which opposes it;
while humanists believe that anyone who
wishes to undergo this operation has
every right to do so. It is quite wrong
for those holding a particular religious
doctrine to use the law to force others
to adhere to it. And it is equally wrong
that the law should remain obscure on
such an important matter.

National Notebook
Business
11/e can’t think of a more appropriate
” simile than to say that it sounds
like cutting off your nose to spite your
face, but a baby foods’ manufacturer
includes advertising material on the firm’s
oral contraceptive in every packet of its
baby food.
Beatle Hunt
YJUe’ll say it for the Sydney Press. It
" left no stone unturned in its hunt
for Beatles. One of the afternoon papers
installed a photographer with telephoto
lens in a Chevron Hilton suite opposite
the more modest Sheraton where the
British singing group was staying. Several
Pressmen moved into the Sheraton
where they photographed every possible
item of Beatleiana, including their
breakfast trolley and three raw steaks
destined for their dinner.
At the Press conference the Beatles
were unfailingly co-operative and quick-
witted. We asked Paul
McCartney whether, as
they employ a large pub-
licity staff writing bio-
graphical material, they
read all that material to
make sure what they said
at Press conferences didn't
contradict previous stories. “We don’t
really need to, because the Press always
misquote us anyhow,” said Paul. The
prize for ingenuity must go to Keith
Smith, covering the Mascot arrival for
ABC sound. Mr Smith brought a girl
to the microphone, asked her name and
age, then said encouragingly, “And I
suppose you’re here to see the Beatles?”
“Oh, no,” said the girl, “I’m doing
a thesis on mass hysteria.” It might have
been stage-managed, but it was worth it.
Counter Attack
“Jt was all,” Denise Darcel (who is
currently singing at Sydney’s Chevron
Hilton) told us, “like a Hollywood film.”
Sprightly, well-stacked, and full of fun,
this Carter Brown cover girl come to life
was talking about her brief, switchback
career in California in the late 1940 s and
early 19505.
“I was discovered in a dime store in a
Paris suburb,” she told us. “I was squeez-
ed into model dresses, given shoes too
light, and suddenly I became the most
photographed girl in France.
“I was a star cover girl, then a singer.
An agent saw me in a nightclub and I
Was taken to Hollywood. 1 appeared in
a nightclub scene in ‘To the Victor* at
Warner Brothers. Then after the picture
nothing. I got a job as a salesgirl at
a Saks Fifth Avenue store in Los
Angeles. There was a long line-up of
people waiting for the job. So I walked
along the queue in my best Paris cos-
tume. People pulled at me. They said,
‘What are you doing, jumping the line?’
But I went up to the personnel manager
and I told him I was the best saleswoman
in Paris. So he took one look at me.
And he put me in the men's wear depart-
ment, selling ties and socks . . .
“When I saw people like Walter Pid-
geon come in I would duck out of sight.
One day a star, one day a salesgirl,
Then I acted for nothing with a tiny com-
pany in Moliere.
“An MGM talent scout saw me. He
took me to MGM. I went into a room
there were Robert Taylor, Van John-
son, Mickey Rooney. The MGM people,
they said, ‘Van Johnson looked at your
legs, you’re hired!’ I got a job —as the
star of ‘Battleground’.
- “Then I was in ‘Westward the Women’.
We had to drive wagons with six mules,
in Utah. I was a New Orleans woman
with a doubtful past who
has to go to California
with some women because
the men there have no
husbands.
“Next they put me in
‘Tarzan and the Slave
Girl’. Lex Barker was
Tarzan. He spoke French fluently. He
had been to the Sorbonne. He was very
cultured. And now he said. ‘Me want
Jane*. And I had to say—as a native
with a French accent ‘Me go there.
Me doctor’s nurse .. .’ Catastrophe!”
After that, nightclub work seemed far
less rugged. ‘‘But one week I was doing
a TV show in New York and a nightclub
act in Atlantic City. I began work at the
studio at six, finished in time to drive
to Atlantic City to hit the stage by 8.30,
then drove back after the show to get
to the set at 6 again. You know, it's a
good thing Fm strong,” Miss Darcel con-
cluded, showing us a very pretty bicep.
Professional Council
ITlhe idea of “United We Stand” has at
last permeated professional ranks.
The NSW branch of the Australian
Medical Association, the NSW Bar As-
sociation, the Law Society of NSW, and
the Australian Dental Association (NSW
branch) have formed themselves into the
NSW Council of Professions with
C. L. D. Meares, QC, as president and

Civil Rights
’WThen we talked to Mrs Kath Walker
" of Brisbane during her recent trip
south she was surprised and pleased
that her book of poetry, “We are Going”,
had already sold out its second edition.
In Melbourne 600 copies were sold in
five days, which is pretty exceptional for
poetry.
However, Mrs. Walker’s mind was
mostly on her projected tour of the
Queensland Aboriginal missions and re-
serves later this month. The tour is
sponsored by the Queensland Depart-
ment of Native Affairs and will take
Mrs Walker as far north as Thursday
Island. Mrs Walker said the tour would
have two purposes. She would gather
facts for a report to be submitted to
the Department. At the same time she
would talk to Aborigines on the reserves
about civil rights organisations working
in the cities. “Mission natives are en-
tirely unaware of the existence of these
organisations,” she said.
Mrs Walker said she believed that she,
as an Aboriginal, would be able to find
out more accurately what Aborigines
thought and felt than any white person.
“It is an unhappy fact that Aborigines
only say what they think the white
man wants them to say,” she said.
Pleasant Date
of the busiest young women in
” Sydney these days is folk-singer
Tina Date; she has been commuting be-
tween folk-music centre, The Troubador,
its newly-opened off-shoot, the Copper-
field, and the St James’ Hall, where the
anthology “By Royal Command” has
just finished its season. Miss Date has
been a classical pianist, actress and as-
sistant stage manager with professional
theatre companies in Melbourne, occa-
sional photographic model, and drama,
sculpture and painting teacher, working
under artist Darryl Hill at a migrant
Creative Leisure Centre (her mother is
sculptor Anita Aarons). She drifted by
chance into folk-singing when she learn-
ed the guitar from friends and found
she had a mezzo-soprano voice.
She arrived from Melbourne last
August for a week’s holiday and has
been here ever since, sharing regular
top-billing at the Troubador and sing-
ing guest spots in other clubs, and leaves
at the end of the “By Royal Command”
season for a concert in Mudgee with col-
league Gary Shearston.
Miss Date seems to us refreshingly
free of the evangelistic purism that char-
acterises the current folk-music boom,
and sings mainly plaintive or risque
English songs. ,
Political Aspirations
A journalist who began his career on,

Ben Chifley well in those days, is going
up as Liberal candidate for Hurstville'
in the next NSW State elections. He is
Mr Tom Mead, who was for many years
one of those elusive “political observers”
in both the Federal and State galleries.,
Mr Mead was music critic for the Sydney
“Daily Telegraph” for some years and,
has written two books, “Man is Never

tyrs, and “Killers of Eden”, on the whal-
ing industry at Eden.

PLAIN ENGLISH
That Basic Wage Judgment!
T AST week two Judges of the
Arbitration Commission favor-
ed increasing Australia’s basic wage
bill by £lOO million a year. Two
thought that £5O million was all
that could prudently be granted.
Such a mammoth difference of
opinion invites attention.
Equal divisions of opinion are
resolved not by drawing lots but by
allowing the opinion of the President
of the Commission to prevail. Sub-
ject to a minimum of three, the
President determines how many and
which members will sit on a basic
wage case. When such divergent
views can eventuate, everything may
depend on the constitution of the
Bench, and the President’s task be-
comes invidious. As two members
did not sit on the recent case, the
views which took effect could have
been those of a one-third minority.
Important matters are not always
left so much to chance. A High
Court consisting of less than all the
Judges cannot give a decision affect-
ing the constitutional powers of the
Commonwealth unless at least three
Judges concur.
Why did two halves of a Bench
which had heard the same evi-
dence and argument differ so
widely? All agreed the economy
was buoyant and the basic wage
should be the highest it could bear.
The striking contrast was in their
attitudes to three closely connected
matters the method of wage-
fixing propounded in the 1961
basic wage judgment, criticism
of it by academic economists, and
the degree of responsibility the
Commission should take for the
general economic situation.
In 1961 Justices Kirby, Ash-
burner and Moore decided to deal
with the basic wage by overall
economic reviews every three or
four years, with annual adjustments
which would primci facie reflect
price movements. This decision
was much criticised, particularly by
three Melbourne Professors, Down-
ing, Isaac and Cochrane. The blos-
soming of sophisticated academic
analysis of the Commission’s
wages policy is one of the bright
spots of the industrial scene in
recent years.
Some major criticisms may be
summarised as follows. It is not
feasible to distribute productivity
increases which have occurred over
a previous three or four years in
an award wage increase. Much of
the productivity increases will have
been distributed in over-award pay-
ments; the award increase will usual-
ly be added to and not absorbed in
the over-award payments, and so will
be inflationary in effect. Productivity
increases can only be effectively dis-
tributed at short intervals as they
occur. Regular productivity adjust-
ments to wages would have more
beneficial effects on the economy
than larger, less foreseeable in-
creases at longer intervals.
Secondly, wages should not nor-
mally be adjusted to changes in
prices. Very few of the reasons
which cause price movements make
it just to alter wages and in those
few cases there are usually better
ways of redressing the balance.
Thirdly, economic adjustments of
basic wage and margins should be
simultaneous, although not neces-
sarily in the same proportions
a total wage case, if not a total
wage.
A major difference between the
judgments of Justices Gallagher and
Nimmo, who favored a 10/- in-
crease, and that of Justices Kirby
and Moore, who favored the £l,
is that the former rejected the 1961
decision and were influenced by the
views of the Professors. The super-
ficially less generous 10/- must be
seen against the background of sup-
port for smaller but more frequent
increases, related directly to changes
in economic capacity, and calcu-
lated to provide more effective real
increases, particularly to those on
low wages and award wages. It also
reflected keen concern for economic
stability, dislocation of which would
most injure those the increase was
designed to benefit.
The proponents of the £l, who
as participants in the 1961 decision
had most reason to answer the Pro-
fessors, largely ignored them. They
adhered to the 1961 decision with-
out meeting the criticisms of it.
Much was made of difficulties
which were said to lie in the way
either of departing from the 1961
decision or of relating wages in-
creases more closely to increases in
productivity. It was said that the
Commission had to keep faith with
the unions which had acted on the
1961 decision that it can only
settle disputes, is not an economic
planning body, and does not fix all
wages and salaries, much less all
incomes.
But these points neither answer
the criticisms of the 1961 decision
nor excuse the Commission from
accepting greater responsibility for
economic developments. The
checks and balances of Federalism,
including those which limit the
Commission’s own powers, make a
coherent overall economic policy
difficult to obtain, and dependent
on the co-operation of many indi-
viduals and institutions. This, how-
ever, should be a challenge to a
body as influential and uncontrol-
lable as the Commission to contri-
bute to an overall solution, rather
than a reason for abdicating re-
sponsibility. It is a comfort that
50% of the Bench seriously tried
to take up this challenge, even
though, by the luck of the draw,
their views did not prevail on this
occasion.


THIS AUSTRALIA
VICTORIA-I
Slow Tempo Campaign
Mr Bolte’s optimism
FROM A MELBOURNE CORRESPONDENT
HENRY BOLTE
No promises
T ast week’s policy speeches from all
parties caused no noticeable increase
in the slow tempo of the Victorian
elections. The opening by Liberal Pre-
mier, Mr Bolte, contained so little in the
way of promises as to remind one of the
kind of policy speech Sir Robert Men-
zies used to deliver before he was shocked
by the 1961 Credit Squeeze election.
Commentators were not very impressed
by the Bolte policy speech, which closed
with a promise of free fishing licences
for old age pensioners—not an attractive
offer, even to pensioners in the depths
of a Victorian winter.
No doubt Mr Bolte can reply to warn-
ings that an electoral policy of “few pro-
mises” involves risks, by saying that he
is probably the only Party leader likely
to have to carry out his promises. He
is still firm favorite to win the election.
Bolte’s biggest threat—the clandestine
romance between the ALP and the
Country Party—is meeting trouble from
the parties’ in-laws. Rural Laborites
have for years regarded the Country
Party as Enemy No. 1. The trade unions,
under the late Melbourne Trades Hall
Council Secretary, J. V. Stout, whose
consistent description of the Country
Party was “lousy”, have always regarded
the Country Party as anti-union.
The Country Party President, Mr Web-
ster, has also found it necessary to
appease conservative elements in his
Party by an assurance that its prefer-
ences will as usual go to the Liberals.
The effect of the assurances was watered
down by his unkind references to the
Liberals and an implied olive branch to
Labor. The diehards are still demand-
ing a repudiation of the ALP from the
Party leader, Sir Herbert Hyland, who,
they say, promised them at the Warr-
nambool Party Conference that there
would be no flirting with the Socialists.
At the same time, in other Country
Party areas, there is support for a tie-up
with the ALP, justified by the claim
that Bolte is out to smash the Country
Party and it is entitled to seek allies to
survive.
. .
significant item o; the Country
Party policy speech was a promise of
some assistance for students of indepen-
. . , , 4 , , ,
dent schools on transport and scholar-
r L- • •. rr , ,
ship allowances. Otherwise it offered the
, , , * . tU A
usual handouts to the countryman.
A crowded house at the DLP open-
ing meeting did not suggest the diminu-
tion of support for which Mr Calwell
is hoping. Its most interesting proposal
was for abolition of the Legislative
Council, and an increase in the Legis-
lative Assembly from 66 to 100 mem-
bers, elected by the Hare-Clark pro-
portional representation system. As
usual the DLP produced a number of
novel policies on decentralisation, care
of the aged, and transport, but the
critics commented that the DLP would
not be a government to implement
them. Its aim is representation through
a proportional system.
Better TV facilities induced Clive
Stoneham to forsake his rural seat of
Midlands, and deliver the ALP policy in
metropolitan Richmond. A former
Minister for Decentralisation, he pro-
mised Government-financed industrial
centres in country areas, also low deposit
housing and land development. There
was humor in his final rebuke to
“political smearers”, with obvious refer-
ence to the DLP, when his succeeding
speaker, Mr Calwell, spent his twenty
minutes in a blazing onslaught on DL?
leader J. Little, his party, Santamaria
and the NCC —described as “Australia’s
Ku Klux Klan and a prostitute splinter
group, mouthing pestiferous nonsense”.
One interest of the Victorian elections
lies in the policies towards independent
schools. They can be summed up:
® Liberals. In view of increased
scholarships in the last Budget, no
promises, but the matter would be
looked at in the next Budget.
® Country Party. Increased transport
and bursary allowances.
• ALP. Free text books for State and
independent school pupils.
® DLP. Full aid within 10 years,
meanwhile interest payments on
buildings and assistance in teacher
training and superannuation.
There were rumors that the ALP
would seek to “jam” the Government by
promises of more substantial “aid” but
they were not realized.
VICTORIA-II
Why the ALP Conference is Off
Jones , Gilhootey and Jordan
FROM ALAN REID IN CANBERRA
the Victorian ALP Con-
ference would have been held last
weekend at the same time as the NSW
ALP Conference. But it was cancelled.
The excuse was the imminence of the
Victorian State elections for which poll-
ing day is June 27.
The excuse is a very real one. But
factors other than the pressure of time
appear to have influenced the controllers
of the Victorian ALP in deciding to hold
the Conference after rather than before
the State elections. With the elections
coming up they wanted to avoid trouble
real trouble.
The Victorian ALP Executive which
controls the Victorian ALP is Leftist. It
has been described as an Executive
without a rank and file. It maintains
its power largely through the Left-wing
unions’ dominance of the Victorian Con-
ference.
Electorally the Victorian ALP Execu-
tive tries to preserve an air of modera-
tion. For example, it selected quizmaster
Barry Jones as a Federal candidate at
the last elections. Jones is a moderate
anti-Communist and with an acceptable
public image. But while the Victorian
ALP Executive was prepared to put
Jones up as a Parliamentary candidate it
was not prepared to accept Jones as one
of its own members. When a casual
vacancy occurred some time ago, Jones,
on the vote received at the last Victorian
Conference, was entitled to the vacant
place. Instead he was deliberately over-
looked.
So far the Victorian ALP controllers
have managed to keep rebellion front


flaring openly. Despite purges, tight dis-
cipline and considerable management of
the Victorian Conference, there still
remains in the Conference a hard core
of potential rebels. The vote for the
ticket that has on occasions been run
in opposition to the ticket sponsored by
the official controllers for executive elec-
tions has shown this.
This year the controllers were faced
with issues they might not be able
to evade. Councillor Gilhooley has
appealed to the Conference against his
suspension last year from the ALP.
Gilhooley’s appeal is dynamite itself.
He was suspended for having, accord-
ing to the Victorian Executive, supported
State Aid for denominational schools in
defiance of a Federal ALP edict to the
contrary.
But the Jordan case is even more
explosive. Jordan, a longtime ALP man,
quite legitimately wanted to succeed to
the Secretaryship of the Melbourne
Trades Hall, left vacant by the death of
the late Mr Vic. Stout.
Though it had for years preached the
doctrine that a political party had no
right to interfere in trade union affairs,
the Victorian ALP Executive interfered
in the belief that its interference would
help the Left-wing unions get into the
job of the Secretary a candidate more
acceptable to them than Jordan. Jordan
was suspended from the ALP by Execu-
tive decision.
Jordan fought back and won the Sec-
retaryship and had the suspension lifted.
This is the type of thing which, when
it comes up for discussion, could touch
off a real rebellion. The present con-
trollers of the Victorian ALP could
probably crush such a rebellion, backed
as they are by the Left-wing unions. But
they prefer to do their crushing after,
rather than before, the Victorian State
elections and at a time when the blood-
stains and the ruthlessness of their
tactics would be less embarrassing
politically. It was considerations such
as these rather than the time factor
which caused the Victorian Conference
to be stood over from last weekend until
after the Victorian State elections are
safely disposed of.
THE ECONOMY
The Treasury and the
Basic Wage Increase
What Canberra loses on the swings ...
FROM J. C. HORSFALL IN MELBOURNE
back-claim element of 325. for
cost-of-living increases since 1953
in the 525. wages claim was so obviously
a try-on that the unions have every
reason to be satisfied with the £1 in-
crease in the Basic Wage. But for em-
ployers there is no reason or logic in a
decision which failed to split a difference
as big as between 10s., thought right by
one half of the Commission, and 20s.
by its other and better half. The in-
crease was nearly three times the em-
ployers’ offer of 75., based on the esti-
mates of productivity and capacity to
Pay.
The employers’ only comfort lies in
the Commission’s refusal to reintroduce
quarterly cost-of-living adjustments.
One must not be too critical of the
Commissioners. Even if it may be
thought that, in current conditions of
full employment, what they call the
“wages drift” —that is the swelling of
over-award payments, the “third tier” of
the wages structure —beyond their reach
had already distributed most of the in-
crease in productivity, there is little
doubt that over the last nine months,
productivity has been rising at something
like double the average rate of from li
to 2 per cent on which the employers
based their 7s. offer. It is unlikely that
this rate of increase in productivity will
be sustained, mainly because much of
the previous surplus industrial capacity
has been taken into use and also because
of labor shortages. But there is consider-
able steam left in productivities all the
same.
With the abounding evidence of eco-
nomic prosperity around them, not to
speak of an overflowing till of overseas
reserves and level of export earnings
which even only a year ago Sir John
Crawford thought would take many years
to achieve, the Commissioners were in
an impossible position to take the nice
productivity calculations of the employ-
ers at their face value.
In some ways the prosperity position
is like 1950 when they also handed out
a fl increase, but they were careful to
point out, as if to underline there was
no enormity in their decision, that the
£1 addition now was a much lower per-
centage of the wages bill than the one
thirteen years ago.
As with all basic wage increases the
most certain beneficiary will be the
Treasury. Its revenue gains not only
from the additional tax it takes from
the bigger wage packets and indirect
taxes on the higher volume of sales
springing from the residue of spending
power left in the hands of wage earners,
but the Treasury also stands to reap even
higher taxation revenue from any infla-
tion induced by the wage increase. The
Federal Treasurer may see the coming
Budget as a mopping-up exercise, taking
back in higher taxes much of the ad-
ditional wage income the Arbitration
Commission has decided to hand out.
“VOYAGER”
Captain’s
Failure?
Regulation 2704
FROM A SYDNEY CORRESPONDENT
Tt was late on Wednesday afternoon
A of last week that Mr J. W. Smyth,
QC, counsel assisting the Voyager Royal
Commission, began reading into the
record a substantial section of his cross-
examination of Captain R. J. Robertson,
captain of HMAS Melbourne. For half
an hour his flat, precise voice spelled
out the question and answer of several
weeks ago.
His conclusion from the evidence was
that final responsibility for the col-
lision rested on Captain Robertson, who,
under Naval Regulation 2704, was re-
sponsible for the manoeuvres of the two
ships. Captain Robertson, as Officer
in Tactical Command (OTC), was in a
position to intervene and give an order.
Further, the Captain’s “negligent
failure” to intervene when he saw the
Voyager turn towards the carrier had
been the final contributing cause of the
collision. Mr Smyth told the Com-
missioner that it must have been apparent
for at least 1+ minutes before the col-
lision, probably for longer, that Captain
Robertson could have taken action.
Compared with the usual cross-fire
of objections that had often marked the
hearing, Mr Smyth was heard out with-
out any objection from Mr N. Jenkyn,
QC, for the Navy and only a few minor
objections from Mr D. Hicks, QC,
appearing for Captain Robertson.
It will be Mr Jenkyn’s job this week
to look after the interests of the two
other officers on the Melbourne whose
conduct was called into question by
Mr Smyth. The young officer of the
watch on Melbourne, Sub.-Lt. J. A.
Bate, on the evidence, according to Mr
Smyth, had been guilty of a breach of
duty under Navy Regulation 3142, which

lays lown that the officer of the watch
is responsible for “the safety of the
ship in all its aspects.”
On the mystery of the missing page
from Sub.-Lt. Bate’s notebook, Mr
Smyth contented himself with the
observation: “It is a suspicious circum-
stance that it is missing.”
The navigation officer of Melbourne,
Commander Kelly, also came under
criticism for his “failure to keep a
proper lookout himself to supervise the
officer of the watch to ensure he was
keeping a proper watch”. Mr Smyth
also referred to the inexperience of the
officer of the watch of Voyager, Lt.
Price, on manoeuvres of a carrier or
destroyer at night.
In his summing up after three days,
Mr Smyth put forward 14 contributing
causes questioning not only the conduct
of officers involved but also raising
questions on signalling, lookout posting
and the use of radar.
LAW
The Crime of Suicide
A case for uniformity
FROM A MELBOURNE CORRESPONDENT
ARTHUR RYLAH
A hint
Should attempted suicide be treated as
a crime? Mr Justice (Sir John)
Barry, one of Victoria’s most eminent
jurists and penal reformers, thinks not.
Sir John’s views on the need for reform
of suicide laws came across at a week-
end symposium at Melbourne University
and were contained in a paper read by
the Dean of Monash University Law
School, professor D. P. Derham. It
suggested that neither suicide nor at-
tempted suicide should be regarded as
crimes and also proposed that the sur-
vivor of a suicide pact who had actually
killed the other party should be held
guilty of manslaughter, but not of
murder.
“Only a relentless and unimaginative
adherent of the doctrine of maximum
severity would be prepared to assert that
the criminal punishment of a poor
wretch driven to attempt self-destruction
could act as a deterrent upon him or
others similarly distracted or that his
conduct called for retributive punish-
ment. Though they regard suicide and
attempted suicide as grave sins, the
Churches seem no longer to consider the
criminal law a fit or adequate agency
to deal with the problem. In practice,
the criminal prohibition against attempt-
ed suicide is used only in a small pro-
portion of cases, and when it is and be-
comes known, its use evokes feeling of
dismay because it does not conform to
the ordinary man’s sense of justice.”
Sir John went on to argue that laws
which affronted the community’s con-
cepts of justice were undesirable. “The
attitude of the police in Victoria is far
in advance of the present law and it may
be taken as an indication of the state
of public opinion.” The point being
made here is that where an attempted
suicide is discovered, criminal proceed-
ings do not follow automatically in Vic-
toria. Under Police Standing Orders a
report must first be forwarded on the
case to the office in charge of the district.
In practice, the matter often ends there.
However, Sir John proposed that it
should be a criminal offence to incite or
advise anybody to commit suicide, or aid
and abet another person in committing
the act. He also suggested that the vari-
ous State laws relating to suicide should
be made uniform. At present the crime
of suicide only exists in NSW, Victoria
and South Australia. Attempted suicide
is a crime everywhere except Tasmania.
Generally, in Victoria at any rate, pro-
bation, sometimes under medical super-
vision, is seen as the best way to help
would-be suicides.
It was a tribute to Sir John’s standing
and to the cogency of his arguments that
within a few days the Chief Secretary,
Mr A. Rylah, announced that his pro-
posals would be examined by the Soli-
citor-General, Sir Henry Winneke. Mr
Rylah pointed out that the City Coroner,
Mr Pascoe, had suggested similar
changes about a year ago. Crown Law
authorities at the time had looked at the
idea, but made no recommendation.
Sir John Barry is unusual on the Vic-
torian Bench. He was appointed to the
Supreme Court in 1947 when aged 43
and was the first appointment to this
bench by a Labor Government in Vic-
toria. Since 1958, however, he has con-
centrated almost entirely on divorce
cases and on the Parole Board, of which
he is Chairman. He was in fact the
main architect of the Victorian parole
system and has been associated with it
since its introduction in 1957.
Although brought up a Roman
Catholic, he owns to no religious creed
these days and always avoids the religi-
ous ceremonies which open the legal
year. He is a lifelong opponent of capi-
tal punishment, a Labor supporter (he
unsuccessfully ran for the House of
Representatives in 1943).
There was some surprise when this
Labor radical accepted a knighthood in
1961. It is traditional for Supreme
Court judges to be knighted after a due
period of service and Mr Barry con-
sidered it would have been uncouth for
him to have broken this precedent. He
devotes a lot of his spare time to histori-
cal research and the topics he picks re-
veal his legal bias.
THE CHINESE AND THE LARRIKINS
feuLLetin
80 Years Ago: June 21, 1884
A Chinaman fell down on the pave-
ment and split his nose open at
Newcastle last week. Some larrikins
had been teasing him and he had
slipped while running after them. It
was great fun. What business has a
person with slant eyes and shaven
head to go about in a free country
like this?
It would be rather a joke if a group
of our own larrikins got into Canton
and a similar argument were applied
to them.
Our Sunday observance law is fear-
fully and wonderfully inter-
preted. For instance, a poor teamster
cannot travel through a town on Sun-
day; but a howling train, very often
a goods one, can rumble through at
pleasure. A starving urchin can't sell
his paper for a copper, but a rubi-
cund parson can sell a stereotyped
prayer or two, and a plagiarised ser-
mon, for golden guineas. Poor travel-
lers can with difficulty obtain a bed
or a feed, while “masher" club-men
grow hilarious over their bottle. The
whole essence of the Act is: “Damn
the poor; carte blanche for the rich.”


STUDENTS—I
Still Waiting for Lefty
Almost a farce
FROM JOHN F. RUSSELL IN SYDNEY
Tf Senator Goldwater clinches his hold
on the Republican nomination next
month (as he is almost sure to do),
students in six Australian universities will
stage hostile demonstrations against him
during the election campaign.
This was one of the motions adopted
by the Australian Student Labor Federa-
tion Congress held at Melbourne Uni-
versity recently. This Congress—a meet-
ing place for the representatives of all
Australian University Labor and ALP
clubs —is held every year in the first
vacation. No one, least of all the
delegates, takes it seriously, but it can
serve as a focal point for the examina-
tion of student socialist thought in Aus-
tralia.
Among the delegates, three groups
were easily definable: the naive (of whom
there were many); the sensible social
democrats; and the classical Marxists
(Communists and otherwise) and their
fellow-travellers. These last were out to
dominate the Congress and turn it into
a stamping ground for their pro-CND,
anti-US policies and they were opposed
consistently only by a solid block of 15
delegates from the Melbourne ALP Club;
the rest did not really seem to know what
was happening or to be really acquainted
with the issues at stake.
The Melbourne ALP Club presented
a united front to the Congress despite
the faction fighting that was taking place
in the Club, even during the Congress.
A group led by Mr James Jupp, the
controversial Political Science lecturer
and author of the just-published “Aus-
tralian Party Politics”, is organising
against the present executive, which
Jupp claims is only a tool of the even
more controversial Dr F. Knopfel-
macher. '
Sydney University ALP Club presents
an entirely different picture: it is firmly
controlled by the present secretary, Miss
Sylvia Hale, and the immediate past
president. Mr lan McDougall—both of
whom are considered extreme Left-
wingers. Both Miss Hale and Mr Mc-
Dougall were vehement in their opposi-
tion to a motion moved by Melbourne
ALP Club that University ALP clubs
have a responsibility to the ALP and,
therefore, it is undesirable for members
of the Communist Party to belong to
University ALP clubs. The motion was
attacked by the Sydney delegates as
“pseudo-subtle red-baiting” which was
“based on a desire to split the Labor and
trade union movement”. But the motion
was carried against the opposition of the
extreme Left by 25 votes to 17.
On such a clear-cut issue, the
Melbourne ALP Club had the advantage
of having the naive on their side. But,
when the simple guiding lines were not
there, as when early in the Congress a
motion was moved censuring the Mel-
bourne ALP Club for many and varied
activities ranging from disagreeing with
the Victorian Central Executive of the
ALP to failing to organise the Congress
properly, the naive were persuaded that
they were only voting against a cabal
of conniving monsters who were mani-
pulated by the “notorious Dr K. . . .”
and that they were saving the ALP and
the Congress from falling under the
influence of such evil manipulators.
The fact that the motion was passed by
a large majority (27-15) indicates the
political immaturity of students from
Canberra (ANU), Adelaide and Monash,
and the general poor state of Australian
student politics.
The high point of absurdity was
reached when lan McDougall of Sydney
moved an amendment to a motion con-
demning Soviet anti-Semitism to the
effect that, among other things, “Capital-
ism is the source of all anti-Semitism and
racial prejudice.” This was, naturally,
defeated.
The well-organised Left wing tried,
unsuccessfully, to force an orthodoxy
on the Congress. Individuals from Bris-
bane and Adelaide shone but, despite
its behind-the-scenes dissensions, Mel-
bourne University ALP Club alone had
any reasonable progressive suggestions.
This fact alone prevented the Congress
from becoming a farce.
STUDENTS—II
The Tories and the Liberal Left
Recognising Red China and Formosa, too
FROM RICHARD HALL IN SYDNEY
HThe student Liberals are often some-
A thing of a puzzle to their elders
in the party. In a party'that has always
been pragmatic and, unlike the British
Conservatives, not very much concerned
with ideology, the students have found
themselves to be odd men out. Their
opinions either tend to be somewhat to
the Left of the party line or alternatively
so true-blue Tory as to regard a great
deal of party policy as betraying sacred
principles. Sydney University had a Con-
servative Association for some time to
cater for those who found the Liberals
too liberal.
The recent conference of the Aus-
tralian Universities Liberal Federation
held in Melbourne produced a mixed
bag of motions more to the Left than
the Tory side. Not surprisingly the con-
ference called for more defence expendi-
ture but also passed a motion calling
for the expulsion of Indonesian military
personnel training in Australia. This got
through before the Sydney delegates ar-
rived and they succeeded two days later
in getting a recommittal motion through.
(It could only apply to two officers at
the Staff College.)
The students also voted in favor of
recognising Red China, with a proviso
for a “Two Chinas” policy. They wanted
immediate implementation of the Re-
strictive Practices legislation. (When the
Attorney-General, Mr B. M. Snedden,
came along to address their dinner, he
added to his list of recent faux pas by
giving the students a standard “Youth
will triumph"-type speech which they
regarded as an insult to their intelli-
gence.)
The conference approved a well-work-
ed out and researched motion on foreign
investment, which they suggested should
be limited by requirements for a pro-
portionate Australian share. At the same
time they wanted tax incentives to en-
courage foreign companies to make
shares available to Australians.
On State Aid, after a muddle of
motions, the whole issue was deferred
for a year. However, the conference
veered to the Tory side in a motion
which disapproved of demonstrations
against South African sporting teams.
The Tory line came out again in a
long, complex debate on fluoridation
when Melbourne put forward a motion
against fluoridation which was ultimately
downed. But Adelaide put forward a
motion in favor of the legalisation of
abortions after rape and incest, which
was passed.
The elections at the end of the con-
ference resulted in an executive with
someone from everywhere except Mel-
bourne, who were unwise enough to put
up a ticket which virtually cut out the
rest of Australia, so things ended with
a veiled threat of disaffiliation from the
unhappy Melbourne delegation.

EDUCATION
Closing Catholic
Primary Schools
Can the struggle be maintained?
By A. F. BENTLEY
/Catholics have seen many changes in
the past twenty years, but in Aus-
tralia this period will go down in Church
history as the time of the great crisis in
Catholic education. Until 1945 we had
maintained for about fifty years a system
of schools which catered for virtually
every Catholic child in the country. For
as long as anyone could remember, it
had been true that, if a child did not
receive a Catholic schooling, its parents
were to blame. For better or for worse,
this is true no longer. Rather it might
be said that the overwhelming problem
of every bishop in Australia is to pre-
vent the schools of his diocese being
swamped. In the largest dioceses this is
a losing struggle—in all of them it is a
desperate one.
How much longer can the struggle be
maintained? To answer this question
would demand statistics of birth rates
whose preparation would demand a great
deal of work; statistics of migration and
population movement within Australia,
which depend on decisions yet to be
made; statistics of expenditure in Catho-
lic schools on a nation-wide basis, which
are probably not available to the bishops
themselves; and estimates of changes in
the cost of schools, which are anybody’s
guess. This much, however, is clear:
in the major dioceses the situation is
already desperate and it is growing worse
every year.
Where is it all to end? This is easier
to answer. We already see the pattern
emerging in Sydney, Melbourne and
Goulburn. The “quality” schools hold
their own; the older suburbs are fairly
adequately catered for and life goes on
much as before; but whole new suburban
districts have no Catholic schools at all,
or schools which can provide for only
a tiny fraction of the Catholic children.
In addition, the demands of rising educa-
tional standards and even of wear and
tear place a strain on older areas, which,
because of their commitments to the
newer districts, they are no longer able
to meet.
This situation must be borne for the
moment, because nothing more can be
done at short notice; but we cannot ad-
mit it indefinitely. It is essentially un-
just that an accident of geography should
determine whether a child receives a
Catholic schooling or not. It is also
unjust that the same accident of geo-
graphy should decide whether parents
should be obliged to incur the additional
expense of sending their children to a
Church school.
The only equitable solution to this
problem is a unified policy throughout
each diocese. Since we cannot provide
schools for all of the children all of the
time, the solution seems to be to provide
them for all of the children some of the
time.
JThns article, condensed from the
June issue of the “Catholic
Worker” (Melbourne), discusses
from a Catholic viewpoint some of
the issues raised by Helen Leigh’s
article “The Catholic Schools’ Cri-
sis” in last week’s The Bulletin.
This means closing either the upper-
most or the lowest classes in all Catholic
schools. Of these two possibilities, only
the second can be seriously entertained,
for a number of reasons:
The object of the change must be to
make sufficient staff available to cater
for all children in the remaining classes.
The largest classes are the lower ones,
so that closing these will release a larger
number of staff for the same number of
classes closed. Moreover, a much higher
proportion of secondary than primary
schools are the property of religious
orders and will not be closed anyhow.
This greatly reduces the saving in staff,
which can be effected by closing secon-
dary classes.
It is a regrettable fact that for most
Catholics religious education ceases when
they leave school. The existence of an
even moderately informed laity there-
fore depends on the continued existence
of the secondary schools. In particular,
to send young Catholics to a university
with only a primary school religious for-
mation would be moral murder —only a
miracle could keep them in the faith.
The classic case for maintaining a
system of Catholic schools, instead of
using the State schools and providing
religious instruction ourselves, is that
education is an integral whole. This
argument applies with much greater force
in the later years.
It should be pointed out that I am
not necessarily stating that the six pri-
mary classes are to be closed. If enough
money, buildings and teachers are avail-
able to provide a Catholic education from
sixth or fifth class on, naturally this
should be done.
It should be clear that there is no
question of closing down all Catholic
primary classes at once and at short
notice. The need to retrain the teachers
will probably mean that only one class
at a time will be closed and a sense of
public responsibility will demand that a
couple of years’ notice of our intention
be given.
It will, of course, be necessary to pro-
vide religious instruction for Catholic
children in the public schools, as is now
done. In part this could be done by the
teachers released from Catholic school
teaching. Public schools in NSW and
Victoria allow one period a week for
this and other classes could be arranged
outside school hours. The latter might
well be associated with other activities,
e.g., scout meetings, youth clubs, etc.
Catholic schools now provide five
periods a week for religious instruction,
but much of this is in fact devoted to
other things. With modern catechetical
methods (which the released teachers,
no longer so overworked, would have
time to study) it is to be hoped that two
or three periods a week would suffice.
An incidental effect would be to give
parents more responsibility in their child-
ren's religious education. Classes could
be arranged (again by some of the re-
lieved staff) for those unable to cope.
This would be salutary for parents as
well as children. At present so much
of the Church's efforts are concentrated
on the school system that one might
wonder if its divine mission were wholly
restricted to those Catholics between
the ages of six and eighteen who happen
to be attending school. A reduced em-
phasis on schools might lead to more
attention being devoted to adults (and
not only parents) and even to new
methods being found to reach lax Catho-
lics whom the traditional parish mission
is becoming less and less able to reach.

The Jews in Australia
God Save the Queen and... Hatikvah!
By SAM LIPSKI
In Melbourne, the children of Israel
have pitched their tents on both sides
of the River Jordan or —to be more
specific—on both sides of what is first
Carlisle Street, St Kilda, before it be-
comes Balaclava Road, Caulfield.
I look over Jordan, a mile to the
north and a mile to the south, the Jewish
mile, and what do I see?
I see four day schools, six orthodox
synagogues, one liberal Temple, a sports
and gymnasium centre, ten kindergartens,
eight Sunday and afternoon schools, four
Jewish butcher shops, three kosher
restaurants and some not so kosher, an
unknown number of delicatessens and
Jewish pastry shops, centres for two
Zionist youth movements and two non-
Zionist youth groups, the centre for the
Bund, a dance hall which echoes each
week to a rock ’n’ roll band belting out
“Havah Nagilah 7 ’ at least once during an
evening, two embryonic theological
seminaries, the headquarters of the B'nai
B'rith Lodge, at least two public mik-
vaoth or ritual bathhouses, the regular
meeting place for the Victorian Jewish
Board of Deputies, a Yiddish school, the
offices of one of Melbourne's two Jewish
weekly newspapers, and, perhaps most
appropriately, I see Stanmark.
Stanmark is a reception and banquet
hall for weddings, engagements and
dinners. Last year it was operating at
the rate of three functions a week.
And yet Stanmark is far more than
that. It is a stage on which the Austra-
lian Jew acts out his search for himself.
In one night at Stanmark, starting with
the traditional pickled herring and end-
ing with the playing of God Save the
Queen and Hatikvah (the Israeli national
anthem), Australian Jews reveal the con-
flicts between generations, the clash be-
tween a European heritage which has not
been lost and an Australian experience
which has not yet been fully grasped, the
gulf between the all-embracmg religious
life of the historic Jewish community and
the present day contradictory but per-
sistent attachment to ritualistic forms of
worship and observance.
The celebration of a Jewish wedding
offers a microcosm for studying the
heady “upwardly mobile” rate of social
climb among members of both first and
second generations. Side by side with
the sometimes ostentatious display of
consumer wealth, there can be seen the
very real warm feeling of fellowship, the
closeness of family ties, the defensiveness
against the “enemy camp” of the non-
Jewish world, the absurdities and gro-
tesqueries of an immigrant minority
community in a state of flux.
On the dance floor at Stanmark a
university-trained Jew, more often than
not a general practitioner or a solicitor,
w iH suddenly become enthusiastic as he
joins in the Chassidic wedding dance,
handkerchief between him and bride. In
any religious or national sense he does
not consider himself particularly Jewish.
His enthusiasm is almost atavistic. It is
an example of attachment which runs
contrary to the predictions of some
sociologists who forecast complete mer-
-B‘ng of minority culture into the greater
Australian environment.
In writing of Jews in Australia I am
writing mainly of Jews in Melbourne
and partly of Jews in Sydney. Of the
nearly 70,000 Jews in Australia, more
than half live in Melbourne, another 40
per cent live in Sydney. The other 10
per cent live almost exclusively in Perth,
Brisbane and Adelaide,
The difference in numbers between
Sydney and Melbourne is only between
six and seven thousand But the tempo
G f Jewish life in the two cities is more
different than mere numbers would indi—
cate. Melbourne Jews typify Australian
j ews pushed, and pushing themselves, to
extremes. Sydney’s communal life is
like a slow motion version of Mel-
bourne’s cinemascope spectacular. In
Melbourne half the Jewish school popu-
lation attends day schools and the
majority of the rest receive some mini-
mum Jewish instruction. In Sydney the
figure is 10 per cent at day schools. The
range, scope and activities of Jewish
organisations is generally smaller,
The differences between Sydney and
Melbourne Jewries, and indeed the
differences between’ Jews within those
cities, can largely be explained in terms
of migrant origins. A greater influx of
East European Jews at crucial stages of
communal development in Melbourne
has given Melbourne the formerly
vigorous, intense Jewish activity of
Poland, Lithuania and Russia. Sydney’s
Jews show the influence of their strong
links with Western Jewish culture and are
less intensely Jewish, more secular, more
assimilated.
Both communities illustrate one verv
important fact about Australia’s Jews,
The majority of them have not been
here for very long, nor for most of them
do their roots go back very far into
Australian history. In 1933 there were
23,500 Jews here. In 1947 there were
32,000. In Victoria and New South


Wales this figure has grown about two
and a half to three times in 30 years.
Looking from the inside out, what does
it mean to be Jewish in Australia in the
’sixties? In Melbourne, the Jewish Mile
accommodates between 50 and 60 per
cent of Jews living in the city. Jews
share the general trend to outer suburbia.
They also display an equally strong drive
to the centres of Jewish living. And so
advertisements for land and property
sales in the suburbs of Caulfield and
East St Kilda make special mention of
“close to synagogues and Jewish schools”.
In some streets land values have inflated
to an unreal degree. Young couples
have mortgaged themselves heavily to
buy houses in the right streets, partly to
keep up with the Cohens, but just as
much to make best use of the facilities
for Jewish life in the area.
The Ghetto
mentioned, Jewish activity and iden-
tification in Sydney is more frag-
mentary and diffuse. Even so, 60 per
cent of Jews live in the Eastern suburbs
of Randwick, Woollahra and Waverley.
About 20 per cent live on the North
Shore.
It would be possible then, at least in
Melbourne, for a Jew to be born, educa-
ted to tertiary level, involved in sports,
clubs, dances, parties (the non-political
kind) and recreation without ever having
had any meaningful contact with non-
Jews or the non-Jewish environment.
Does all this mean that there is a ghet-
toisation of Jewish life in Australia? Are
the ladies of the Women’s Zionist Organi-
sation sitting down to their Give-and-Get
dinner at the Bamboo Room of the
Chevron-Hilton living in a ghetto without
a wall?
The answer depends on an under-
standing of what a European ghetto was
like for their grandparents. For the
overwhelming majority of Jews the ghetto
was life itself from birth to death. They
did not go beyond it because they did
not have to go and because they could
not even if they wanted to. The ghetto
fulfilled all their needs and they partici-
pated in all of its activities. It was
essentially a religious community.
But there are very few Jews in Aus-
tralia who participate in the whole range
of Jewish activities that the unwalled
ghetto offers. It is the working out of
which institutional, organisational, and
social affiliations he will choose and what
values he assigns to them in his daily
life that is the way in which an Austra-
lian Jew defines his commitment to his
vision of Judaism.
Thus while a Jew can live next door
to a Chassidic synagogue, he may never
set foot inside it, preferring to spend his
Sabbath afternoon following the fortunes
of St Kilda or Carlton in the Victorian
Football League than at the rabbi’s table
learning the Talmud—the encyclopaedic
codification and exposition of Jewish
Oral Law. He would protest strongly if
his Jewishness was questioned, although
his grandfather would have difficulty in
accepting the protest.
Who then is an Australian Jew today?
There can be no definitive answer to this
precisely because of the diversity of Jew-
ish expression. As a rough working
definition it might be said that he is
someone who was born a Jew, has had
the opportunity to sever his ties with
Jews but has not done so. Beyond that
I would be reluctant to fit Australian
Jewry into any one single pattern or
mould. The pattern makers and the
mould builders exist of course, Jews not
least among them.
Looked at from the point of view of
some of its communal leaders, the pat-
tern is one which reflects their own shin-
ing glory as the best organised Jewish
community in the world, with the biggest
and best Jewish day school, the warmest
hearts, the greatest freedom from anti-
Semitism and a future which will en-
shrine their name on the ever-increasing
number of plaques and foundation stones
as Jews go about indulging their “edifice
complex”.
Looked at from the point of view of
an orthodox rabbi in Melbourne, Austra-
lian Jewry has displeased God because it
accepts too easily the diversity of belief
and practice which allows a liberal rabbi
to see this as its strength. From the
viewpoint of some visiting Israeli fund-
raising emissaries the pattern, in public,
is one of warm hearts. In private they
see Australian Jewry as going through
its penultimate, if not terminal, phase.
To have been looked at from the point
of view of the social scientist is for the
Australian Jew a rare experience. Except
for some research of doubtful validity
done in Melbourne during the late 1940 s
and early 19505, the only other compre-
hensive work has been done for an
unpublished master’s thesis in Melbourne
University’s Political Science Depart-
ment.
Looked at from the point of view of
readers of The Bulletin and “Nation”,
Australian Jews in the ’sixties are active
politically and deeply split between Mel-
bourne and Sydney. From this vantage
point Jewishness may sometimes be seen
as a function of one’s response to Russian
anti-Semitism and the political repercus-
sions this has had in Australia.
Looked at from the point of view of
the philo-Semite, religious or intellectual,
the Jew seems endowed with special
qualities of faith, intelligence, education
and for want of a word with the same
connotations, “brilliant”.
I believe that all these points of view
see only some of the essence of Austra-
lian Jewish life, quite often in cliches of
their own making. Jews themselves quite
often see themselves in these same
cliches. They respond to the anti-
Semite by admitting among themselves
that some of his prejudices describe real-
ity. Like all victims of prejudice they
often react in fact by moving towards the
extremities which the anti-Semite invents.
Of course, they do not accept only the
anti-Semitic cliches. More often they
are the cliches of the philo-Semite. I
grew up in the Jewishness of post-war
Carlton, a Melbourne suburb which was
first-stopover for many migrant Jews,
immediately before the war when my
parents came there, and immediately
after. 1 was born in Carlton. My father
came from Warsaw, my mother from a
small village in Central Poland. I was
brought up in an orthodox environment,
but I parted company with orthodoxy in
the last years of my university studies,
a not uncommon experience for Jews of
my generation. I have never known
anti-Semitism in any serious way. Except
for some isolated occasion of name-
calling, I have, I think, been surprised at
the exotic associations that the fact that
I am a Jew conjures up for friends rather
than the racially antagonistic ones.
Admittedly any vantage point in an
impressionistic survey tends to be sub-
jective. Mine certainly is. But looked
at “in the round” there are some ques-
tions that could be asked about Austra-
lian Jews. What are the main ways in
which the diversity of Jewishness ex-,
presses itself within the community?
How do Jews as individuals and as a
community react and behave in the non-
Jewish world? And what of the future
for Jews in Australia?
Liberal and Orthodox
„
HThe first question could be asked in
another way. What makes Jews feel
Jewish? There are no clear lines of
demarcation between the major forms
of expression. Nevertheless for the
simple job of description they can be
described as religious, ideological, philan-
thropic, and socio-cultural. “If five
shipwrecked Jews reach a desert island
there will soon be six synagogues, seven

rabbis, and eight wardens”, goes a Jewish
saying.
Superficially there are only two sorts
of religious Jews in Australia, liberal and
orthodox. In fact the old Jewish saying
seems to be a better description. The
terms liberal and orthodox are nominal
divisions. If a Jew says he is orthodox
he may mean any number of things.
If the term is taken as describing the
strict observance of the Jewish Law
including punctilious observance of the
Sabbath (refraining from driving,
switching on electric power or television,
radio or going to the pictures) as a spiri-
tual day of rest, regular attendance at
synagogue, prayer three times a day and
maintenance of the dietary laws, then
perhaps only one in every ten Jews is
really orthodox. Even then his mode of
orthodox behavior will vary, ranging
from the Chassid of Lubavitch with his
emphasis on spiritual ecstasy and the joy
of worship, through to the Australian-
born Jew who follows his service more
formally by watching the scoreboard at
the far end of the synagogue which tells
him the page number in his Hebrew
prayer book.
In between, and ranging off at a tan-
gent, are Jews of Hungarian origin who
are strictly fundamentalist and self-
isolating from the rest of the community,
and the outwardly more integrated Jew-
ish businessmen of the Beth Mizrachi
congregation who are in fact more
obscurantist in their religious behavior
than their fathers were before them. And
there are the “three-days-of-the-year-
Jews” who hold membership in orthodox
synagogues but whose main expression
of orthodoxy is to leave their car parked
around the corner instead of in front of
the synagogue on the Day of Atonement
or the Jewish New Year. It would be
difficult to give an exact figure but the
majority of Jews would attend syna-
gogue at least on those three days a year.
The Canberra Centre
HThe larger synagogues like St Kilda
Hebrew Congregation and Melbourne
Hebrew Congregation in Melbourne and
Sydney’s Great Synagogue and Central
Synagogue have socially prominent Jews
on the membership list. Yet every Sab-
bath there is an emptiness in these syna-
gogues compared with the number of
people affiliated, socially prominent or
not.
Similarly the term liberal may describe
a less varied but still large range of
Jewish attachment. Less concerned with
ritual, and rejecting the traditional Jew-
ish Law as completely binding, the liberal
Jew has more in common with his
nominally orthodox neighbor than either
often realises. Claiming an adherence
of about 10 per cent of the Jewish com-
munity the liberals are increasing their
strength all the time. The way they are
beginning to flex their muscles is shown
in the row over the future of Canberra’s
national Jewish centre. When the appeal
for funds began liberal Jews asked for
a guaranteed right of access to the centre
when it was built to hold services and
meetings.
The Canberra Jewish community,
which ironically is not strictly orthodox
though it follows orthodox forms of
synagogue worship, was wary of the re-
quest. It was frightened that in a small
community (about 200 Jews) the setting
up of two streams of Jewish religious
practice would lead to the division, name-
calling and acrimony which are the fea-
tures of orthodox-liberal co-existence in
the larger States. So it refused. The
liberals reacted sharply to the refusal,
telling their members not to support
the building appeal financially.
The resultant controversy, especially in
Melbourne, showed that while the terms
liberal and orthodox may not have any
clear meaning as descriptions of the
religious behavior of individuals, there
are serious differences between liberal
and orthdox Jews at the rabbinic and
organisational levels.
These differences are more serious in
Melbourne than in Sydney. Largely this
can be explained in terms of the per-
sonalities among the rabbinic leadership
of both groups in the two cities. In
Sydney the liberals’ Rabbi Dr Brasch and
Orthodoxy's Rabbi Porush seem to have
agreed to differ on religious matters.
They are less inclined to use the strong
word or the accusing admonition from
the pulpit against one another. On non-
religious issues they will co-operate to
speak on the same platform.
In Melbourne, Rabbi Dr Rappaport
has been implacable in his opposition to
liberal Judaism both leligiously and
communally. He has made it clear that
he regards the liberals as a danger to the
preservation of Judaism in Australia.
Over the years the Temple's Rabbi Dr
Sanger has become more sensitive to the
orthodox opposition and is less inclined
to accept it today without vigorous
counter-attack.
To some Jews in Melbourne the differ-
ence between the liberals and orthodox
reaches its most unsavory heights (or
depths) when it spills over into the non-
religious expression of communal life.
When the Victorian Jewish Board of
Deputies announced this month that
orthodox Rabbi Lubofsky would join
liberal Rabbi John Levi on the platform
at a rally called officially to protest
against Russian anti-Semitism, the
whisper campaign started against Rabbi
Lubofsky. Some fellow orthodox rabbis
contacted him threatening to isolate him
if he appeared on the same platform.
But despite these differences and the
occasional outbursts against rabbis in the
Jewish Press, their congregants assign
considerable importance to their rabbis
especially when they appear on television
or act as spokesmen for Jews.
Ideological expressions
HThe ideological expressions of Judaism
in national or political movements of
the kind which flourished in Europe are
much rarer in Australia. The only two
groups that can claim any ideological
expression of Judaism are the Zionists
and the Bund. It is symptomatic of the
ideological impoverishment of the Zionist
movement since the establishment of the
State of Israel that I believe they should
really be discussed under the heading of
philanthropic expression. It is sympto-
matic of the Bund’s failure or reluctance
to accept the reality of modern Israel
and recent Jewish history that it ought to
be discussed under the heading of socio-
cultural rather than ideological. Zionism
is the modern nationalist expression of
the Jewish people’s wish for a State. It
started in Europe in the late nineteenth
century as a combination of political and
messianic aspiration. The Zionist move-
ment in Australia must be distinguished
from the large number of Jew's who sup-
port Israel either w ith cash or sentiment
or both.
On paper the number of affiliated or-
ganisations and the numbers of members
look large. But a good proportion of
these are women’s organisations whose
sole purpose is fund raising and social
togetherness. The political arm of the
movement is withering slowly. Since the
emergence of the State of Israel political
Zionists have been faced with a crisis.
Does it mean anything today to be a
Zionist and not go to Israel? Israel’s
Ben-Gurion has answered this question
with a resounding no. Only this year
has another former Israeli Prime Minis-
ter Moshe Sharett suggested a different
answer. The essential mission of Zion-
ism according to Sharett had always been
the maintenance of the Jewish people
everywhere, with Israel as a means to
this end but not essentially as a goal.

OUT AND ABOUT
A Strong Dose of Oxford’s Dolce Vita
Deer parks , Georgian silver and clean shoes
By ROSS CAMPBELL
Iwent to Oxford 30 years ago as a
Rhodes Scholar from Victoria. How
I came to be a Rhodes Scholar is
another story; it has puzzled some people,
like Old Rowley's win in the Melbourne
Cup. Still, wisely or not, the Rhodes
Trust disbursed a total of £l2OO sterling
to keep me at Oxford, and on vacations,
for three years.
I could not say unequivocally that
they were happy years. For much of the
first one I was groping around uneasily
in hopes of being accepted. For much
of the final year the shadows of a doubt-
ful and penurious future followed me
down the High Street and into the
Bodleian Library and through the sherry
parties. But there was a middle period
when Oxford seemed a wonderful place.
My strongest impression of the ex-
perience of being there is that it was
unreal and anachronistic, quite unrelated
to anything that has happened to me
since. One reason for this feeling is the
extremely—indeed, absurdly—luxurious
conditions of living which I enjoyed. I
got an extra strong dose of the Oxford
dolce vita because I was at Magdalen,,
one of the most beautiful and sybaritic
of the colleges.
For a year I lived in cream-panelled
18th-century rooms with windows open-
ing on a deer park. There is definite
status attached to having deer outside
one’s windows, even though they keep
one awake at night in summer with the
extraordinary noises they make while
mating. Occasionally a deer was killed
and we had venison for dinner, which I
found disappointingly tough. The dinners
in Hall at Magdalen were nothing out
of the way, except for drinking beer
from Georgian silver mugs. The meals
served in rooms, however, received the
FACES AND PLACES: The first
of a series of occasional pieces.
attention of the college’s renowned chef,
Duke, and were splendid, featuring such
wonders as negresse en chemise.
The aspect of Oxford luxury that
haunts me most of all is the shoe-clean-
ing. It was the only time in my life
when I have been able to leave my shoes
outside the door and be sure of finding
them cleaned next morning. The clean-
ing was done by Gibbs, one of the
college servants or scouts. One after-
noon a visitor, who had been in residence
a few years previously, met Gibbs at
work at the foot of a staircase. “Hello,
Gibbs!” he said. “Still cleaning the
shoes?” The old scout replied with
dignity: “Maybe I likes cleaning shoes.”
The scouts, who were a hereditary
class, helped to give Oxford its lost-
world atmosphere. Most of them were
intensely conservative. One mentioned
to me that G. D. H. Cole had been a
don at Magdalen before he went to
University College. “I can't say I was
sorry to see 'im go,” the scout said.
“ ’E was a bit of a Bolshie if you see
what I mean.” Another of the Magdalen
scouts won general approval by the way
he stood up to Prince Franzi Hohenlohe,
an Austrian undergraduate. The Prince
asked to be addressed as “Your High-
ness”. His scout replied: “The Prince
of Wales never asked us to call ’im that,
and we're not doin’ it for you.”
Each day my scout made my bed and
tidied my sitting-room and, in winter,
lit the fire. If I had guests to lunch he
waited at table. I have dwelt at some
length on the comforts and services at
Oxford because they are supporting
evidence for an opinion I hold, which is
that, whatever the graces and virtues of
that university, it does not give a very
suitable preparation for the rigors of
present-day living.
The Oxford system was evolved for
the education of young gentlemen of
means in the 18th and 19th centuries.
When I was there the system survived
almost intact, and I understand it still
does. Unfortunately many of those who
graduate now are not gentlemen of means

but job-seekers, and ill-equipped ones at
that. The kinds of knowledge which
Oxford traditionally imparts history,
philosophy, literature, and so on are
not of much direct utility except in the
teaching profession (which I tried for a
time with unsatisfactory results). So the
young man leaving Oxford usually ex-
periences a sudden collapse in his stand-
ard of living, symbolised by the fact that
he has to clean his shoes.
Some voluptuous siren
HThis change brings with it a sense of
resentment, and of having been
misled. It is rather as if some voluptuous
siren had let him stay at her place for
three years and then booted him out
abruptly into the cold world. I tasted
this sensation to the full when I went
back to depressed Melbourne in 1937,
with a BA and B.Litt. (Oxon) in my
luggage, and walked the streets for three
months without being able to get a job.
The supper parties I had been to in the
summer term in rooms in the Cloister
Quad, eating cold Scotch salmon while
the evening light was on the lawns out-
side, seemed part of a remote and
fantastic episode.
The feeling that Oxford does not quite
belong to the real and the present is
much more, of course, than a matter of
its physical amenities. The pervasive
spirit of the place, as I knew it, was
sceptical and not conducive to ambition.
The emphasis was on talking rather than
doing, and much importance was
attached to the possession of what was
called a good mind. I would hear
people say: “Thursby-Smith got a first in
Greats. He has a very good mind”. Or:
“Johnson took a double first. He has a
brilliant mind”. I was frightened they
would say of me: “Campbell took a third.
He has a lousy mind”. In the event
I got a second-class degree, presumably
showing myself to have a mediocre mind.
One could not help noticing that at
Oxford a mind was treated by many as
a decoration, like a mid-Victorian
epergne. As long as it was of good
quality, there was no need to use it for
practical purposes. Certainly the mind
was not regarded as a means to material
success.
This mind-mindedness enables Oxford
to produce persons of distinction in the
academic and other strictly intellectual
occupations. But it is a dubious asset,
and may even be a handicap, in careers
which are highly competitive and oppor-
tunistic, like business or politics. Only one
of my Oxford contemporaries has made a
name for himself in the world of public
affairs Jack Profumo. A few have
done well in the law, such as Jeremy
Hutchinson, QC a Magdalen man, I
am proud to say whose advocacy
enabled Miss Christine Keeler to get off
with a sentence of nine months. One
rarely hears of an Oxonian who has
made astute take-over deals or cornered
scrap metal or otherwise got into the
big money.
I do not mean to suggest by this ac-
count that the average person at Oxford
was a thinker. Ear from it. At most
universities the intellectual life is some-
thing like the football. There is a first
team of skilled performers; there are a
certain number of talented aspirants who
turn out for practice a few nights a
week: but the majority are merely
lookers-on. It was like that at Oxford
in my time. The dark blues fielded a
good first cerebral XV, including crowd-
pleasers like Isaiah Berlin, Dick Cross-
man, and Gilbert Ryle. Some stars of
the future Stuart Hampshire, Peter
Medawar, Barbara Ward were in hard
training. But I am sorry to say that I
was among the large number for whom
intellectual athletics remained principally
a spectator sport.
While I had myself to blame for this,
it did not help to be taking one of the
degree courses least stimulating to mental
exertion. Six years in the schools of
English Language and Literature in Mel-
bourne and Oxford left me unconvinced
that English is a worthwhile major sub-
ject for university study. The courses
are padded out with much futile stuff of
no interest except to the few specialists,
who make a living out of it. I hate to
think of the time I misspent at Oxford
trying to remember textual emendations
of the clod-hopping “epic” “Beowulf”, or
variant readings of the puns in “The Two
Gentlemen of Verona”. I would regard
the work I did there for my BA as mostly
wasted if I had not had the luck to be a
pupil of C. S. Lewis.
This formidable scholar was in his
mid-thirties, his portly and jovial appear-
ance belying the sharpness of his mind.
In general we did not have much in
common. Lewis was a medievalist of
monastic tastes. He had been to only
two picture shows in his life, “Cavalcade”
and “King Kong”, and considered King
Kong the best film actor he had seen.
His aloofness from the modern world
could be gauged by a remark he made
in a lecture on Dante: “Then the Renais-
sance came and spoiled everything”. Yet

...and

diet
Many doctors believe that choles-
terol is one of several factors
having a strong connection with
serious ailments. The more choles-
terol in the blood, the greater
the apparent risk. The amount of
cholesterol in the blood depends
on not only the amount but also
the type of fat in the daily diet.
Saturated fats (the kinds found
in dripping and butter) raise the
level of cholesterol. Poly-unsatur-
ated fats can reduce the level.
What are poly-unsaturated fats?
These fats are most commonly
derived from vegetable sources,
particularly Safflower oil, yielding
a very high content of poly-
unsaturates, a most important one
being linoleic.
What is “Miracle”? A new table

Oil, rich in poly-unsaturates.

he deeply impressed me with the power
and originality of his mind. When he
was talking about Gower or Malory you
were not listening to standard opinions;
the ideas were fresh and his own, and
expressed always with rare felicity.
Unhappily, as time went by and I
lapsed into the hedonistic round of Ox-
ford, I declined in Lewis’s esteem. Yet
I think he had a lasting effect on me,
in one way at least. This was through
his example of the do-it-yourself method
of forming opinions. Ever since I have
had an almost morbid aversion from
fashionable cults and fads, of the literary
or any other kinds. .
In describing the easy life of Oxford
in the 19305, I am bound to add that
we were not altogether easy in mind.
One could not be in those days. From
my window in Magdalen I saw the un-
employed “hunger marchers” tramp
along the High Street, a reminder that
everyone did not eat negresse en chemise.
Then there were the ominous things in
the papers about Hitler and Mussolini
(we did not worry so much about Stalin,
who seemed at that time less likely to
give trouble). One morning I opened
“The Times” and read that Hitler had
shot Roehm and other former friends of
his because of their “abnormal pro-
clivities”. I was struck by the decorum
of his phrasing, but still more by the
roughness of his behavior.
Ambitious exhibitionists
were a number of busy political
clubs in Oxford, to none of which I
belonged, being a non-joiner by tempera-
ment. The Union, the chief political
debating society, was not in high repute
with the university at large, which
regarded it as an arena for ambitious
exhibitionists. Reports of Union debates
in “The Isis” were headed: “Europe
Listens While Oxford Sleeps.” The Com-
munists, who were few but zealous,
banded together in the October Club,
where they made ludicrous efforts to
pretend they belonged to the working
class. They used to get up numerous
petitions, inscribed at the top: “Name”
and “Factory or Works”. In the “Factory
or Works” column the signatories wrote
“New College”, “Balliol”, etc.
A good deal of influence was exerted
in the university by that righteous Friday
oracle “The New Statesman and Nation”.
I heard a man in the High say of some-
one else: “Oh, he’s just a ‘New States-
man’ sort of person”; and for a while I
was that sort of person myself. The
“New Statesman” policy was somewhat
confused—it demanded a firm stand by
the League of Nations against dictators,
while at the same time it opposed heavy
expenditure on armaments. This attitude
had a strong appeal to undergraduates:
it offered an outlet for our moral indigna-
tion without involving the unpleasant

prospect of military service. The more
Tory Oxonians, however, despised the
League as un-British. During the Abys-
sinia crisis an Old Etonian rowing blue
said of Anthony Eden: “I don’t know
how this chap Eden got mixed up with
the League of Nations. I believe he had
quite a good war record.”
My sharpest recollections of the
university are not of public affairs but
of individuals, the people I liked. One
of them was Sidney Carter, a quiet man
in Balliol whose remarks were usually
distinguished by a freshness of view-
point. I was sitting drinking with him
and others in lodgings on the night King
George V died, while the BBC announcer
repeated at intervals in sepulchral tones:
“The King’s life is moving peacefully
towards its close.” Nobody had much
of interest in the way of comment until
Sidney said suddenly. ‘We’ll never have
another King like William and Mary’.”
The most richly flavored personalities
among the Oxford dons were usually
bachelors, like Lewis. The unmarried
state allowed their singularity to develop
with less hindrance, and gave them more
time for college life and conversation,
also more opportunity to explore byways
of learning, than if they had gone home
at night to a family. Contact with these
often delightful characters was one of the
distinctive things of Oxford. If and
when most of the dons there lead nor-
mal domestic lives, the place will become
just another university.
One of those whom I remember was
Professor Dawkins, the Professor of
Byzantine and Modern Greek. This
elderly, dishevelled scholar was a non-
stop talker of an effervescent kind. When
I first met him, at lunch, he was telling
how some intoxicated undergraduates
at a nearby college had crucified their
chaplain by pinning him on the lawn
with croquet hoops. Dawkins said: “He
called after them, ‘You’ll all be fined for
this!’ It was an un-Christian attitude,
don’t you think?”
Professor Dawkins enjoyed more lei-
sure than most dons because he had
few pupils. Some committee or other
asked him. how many lectures he gave
a year. He replied: “One, but I don’t
give it every year’’. He was a Fellow of
Exeter College, where he was embar-
rassed by the improper postcards sent to
him from the Continent by his friend
Norman Douglas. I was told that while
reading “The Times” at the breakfast
table Dawkins gave one of his cackling
laughs and exclaimed: “Another Exeter
man gone to gaol!”
The influence of bachelor dons was
part of the generally masculine and
clubby character of the University. The
sexes did encounter each other at Ox-
ford, but less than in most places. A
man who was found to have some con-
traceptive appliances in his rooms was
summoned by the dean of his college.
The dean said: “I must ask you to ex-
plain your possession of these er
amorous engines.” There were a few
affluent and dashing undergraduates who
made sorties to London, returning by
the night train known as the “Flying
Fornicator”. But a much larger number
considered that playing around with
girls during term was not quite the thing.
They called it womanising, as if it were
some kind of abnormal practice.
This self-denying ordinance was con-
venient, because there were not enough
girls in Oxford to go round. The
women’s colleges were four in number,
compared with more than 20 for the
men. A folk tale related that a man had

appeared outside each of the women’s
colleges. At Somerville the girls said:
“What is he reading?” At Lady Mar-
garet Hall they said: “Who are his
family?” At St. Hilda’s they said: “What
does he look like?” At St. Hugh’s they
said: “Show him in”. The story over-
simplified the facts, as all these colleges
harbored some girls who were both
bright and amiable. But there was no
question of a man being shown in. Male
visitors were turned back at the gates by
elderly porteresses of extreme severity
and vigilance.
The university had wide powers to
discourage high jinks of an amorous
nature, the executive arm consisting of
two dons called Proctors and their comic
bowler-hatted leg-men, the “Bulldogs”.
If they found a prostitute in business
they could make her leave town. There
was a story that a Proctor saw an under-
graduate one night with a girl of suspect
reputation, and summoned him for
questioning. “Please explain why you
were in the company of that young lady,”
the Proctor said.
“She’s my sister, sir,” was the reply.
“But I have reason to believe she is
a person of immoral character.”
“I know, sir. Mother is very worried
about it.”
PSI for pornography
nPuRNiNG to the more scholarly side of
Oxford, I must make mention of my
special love for the Bodleian Library.
This rambling Jacobean and medieval
structure would have been an up-to-date
librarian's nightmare. It had no card
index, and the catalogue was a weird
compilation that had grown up over a
century. You found the subject “War”,
if you were lucky, under “B” (for
“bellum”). Pornographic books were
catalogued under the Greek letter Psi—
an interesting fact which I did not dis-
cover, unfortunately, until my last week
at the university. But whatever its
peculiarities the Bodleian had the
romantic feel of a truly great library.
It seemed to me to be rather careless
of its treasures. I worked out a plan for
stealing a First Folio Shakespeare, worth
thousands, which was in a glass case in
one of the quiet galleries. In my day-
dreams I would become notorious as the
crook Rhodes Scholar. But how did one
dispose of a First Folio? That was the
difficulty. In the warm afternoons of
the summer term it was hard to concen-
trate on my prescribed books. I would
send out orders for novels—the Bodleian
had everything, if you were prepared to
wait for it and gaze speculatively at the
girl students.
Sometimes I would visit friends in the
afternoon in one or other of the colleges.
Each of the colleges was supposed to
have its own marked characteristics.

hand, and those
from more obscure
schools on the
other, generally
stayed apart. Being
a kind of neutral,
I had friends in
both sectors.
I noticed very little hostility to Rhodes
Scholars in the university, and where it
existed it was more of an intellectually
than a socially snobbish kind. There
was evidence of it in a satirical poem
entitled “An essay on Oxford”, which
said that
Rhodes’s Scholars, virtuous band
uncouth,
With noble crudity pursue the truth.
I resented this gibe crude I may have
been, but I was by no means noble.
However, such animosity was uncommon.
Scattered among the colleges, Rhodes
Scholars did not see a great deal of one
another, as a rule, except when invited
to Rhodes House by the Warden, Dr C.
K. Allen, and his nice wife. C. K.
Allen, who came from Sydney, was a
noted legal thinker and possessed an
astringent wit, which he exercised at
times on his Scholars. I was present
when an American Rhodes Scholar
rashly mentioned that he had seen a film
that morning. C.K. said: “After coffee,
I suppose”. It was enough to convey
the message.
I was treated with much kindness by
the Allens, and enjoyed their company,
yet there was something about Rhodes
House that made me vaguely uneasy.
It was the duty of maintaining a reverent
attitude to The Founder. Though Cecil
Rhodes was a great man, I never felt
he was my type. He was imperialistic,
ruthless, and mirthless; also he disliked
women. At the same time, I was aware
that if it had not been for Rhodes I
would not be at Oxford. These con-
flicting feelings were in my mind at the
valedictory dinner for departing Rhodes
Scholars when the toast of The Founder
was proposed. Full of South African
wine, I reflected that after all I had had
a great time at The Founder’s expense,
and had given him rather poor value
for his money. I rose and drank the
toast with a deep and genuine sense of
gratitude.
The circumstances of my departure
from Oxford were
confused and in-
auspicious. I had
obtained a B.Litt.
by writing a totally
useless thesis on an
obscure and nasty
Regency book-re-
viewer named
Croker. A copy of
my thesis had been
laid to eternal rest
in the vaults of the
Bodleian Library. I
loitered at Oxford
doing some alleged
research but spending most of my time
with various boon companions. One of
these was a picturesque undergraduate
named Guy Challis. Guy’s rooms were
always dark, and people came and sat
around while he played the guitar. He
kept bottles of beer in a window-box, a
demijohn of pickled onions on the table,
and a hutch of white rabbits in a corner.
As I remember, he referred to his bed-
room as “the abode o’ love”.
My money was running out, and one
day I decided I had better go back to
Australia. When I told Guy I was
leaving, he stopped playing the guitar and
said: “I must give you a present”.
He reached over to a pile of clothes
that had come back from the laundry
and pulled out a shirt.
“Here, have one of my shirts”, he said.
The shirt came in handy, and his ges-
ture remained in my mind. Looking
back over my years at Oxford it is hard
to name anything specific that I gained
from them. But I do think I acquired
a certain knowledge of English life, and
a lasting affection for the English and
their odd ways. These things were learned
at such moments as when Guy Challis
gave me his shirt.

A dragon for Mr. Dawson
Chinese dragons and other age-
old Eastern customs are some
reasons why lots of Dawsons,
Smiths and Browns now go to
Europe via Hong Kong.
Other reasons include duty-free
purchase of the world’s top-quality
goods. Gay Oriental living. And
Lufthansa.
Lufthansa? Yes. For at Hong
Kong you can change to Luft-
hansa and fly on to any of 50
cities in 5 continents.
But why change?
A good question. And there’s a
good answer: because Lufthansa
service is as invitingly German as
the Schwarzwald.
It means friendly, English-speak-
ing cabin crews. Refinements like
hearty German beer from the keg,
Westphalian ham, black bread.
Reliability that has set punctu-
ality records over many routes,
including the North Atlantic.
And Boeing 707 Intercontinentals,
biggest and most powerful 707’s
in service. Plus brand new Boeing
727’s and well-proven 7208’5.
Who needs a dragon to lure them
to Hong Kong. Lufthansa is lure
enough.
But what if you can’t go via
Hong Kong? No problem. Just
join Lufthansa at Bangkok, San
Francisco or Johannesburg for
almost anywhere else in the world.

The Flag and the
Fishermen
O Canada!
From BERNARD DUFRESNE in Ottawa
The hottest political issue now
threatening to divide the country,
and perhaps bring down the
minority Liberal Government of Prime
Minister Lester B. Pearson, is the ques-
tion whether or not Canada will have
its own distinctive flag.
It may seem strange after 97 years
of Confederation that Canada still does
not have its own flag, but it is only in
recent years that the idea of a national
flag has spread outside the French-
speaking Province of Quebec.
Since 1945, the Red Ensign has been
the official emblem flown by Canada.
This is the case, for example, at UN
headquarters in New York and else-
where. The special status to the Red
Ensign, a red flag with the Union Jack
in the masthead corner and the Canadian
coat-of-arms in the fly, was given by
an Order in Council approved by the
Liberal administration of the late Prime
Minister Mackenzie King. The Red
Ensign, the flag under which Canadian
troops fought, was used by Canada,
mainly on an ad hoc basis, not with any
legal recognition.
The Liberal Government of Mr Pear-
son was elected last year with a pledge
of producing a distinctive national flag
within two years of taking office. The
Prime Minister has made clear in recent
months that the Government intended to
honor its promise. He has done so in
face of mounting parliamentary criticism
and a campaign of opposition headed
by the Canadian Legion, the national
veterans’ organisation that less than 20
years ago kicked up a dust when the
Government recognised the Red Ensign
instead of the Union Jack.
Mr Pearson has insisted that the ques-
tion of a national flag was only part of
the question of national unity and has
rejected demands for a national referen-
dum on the issue.
The new design, if it ever eventuates,
will probably be three red maple leaves
on one stem against a white field, with
two blue stripes at either end. The blue
stripes would represent Canada’s motto
From Sea to Sea.
The maple leaf motif is already
represented in the Canadian coat-of-
arms and in Canadian Army insignia.
Thus, it is not something totally new
to Canadians. One argument against the
design is that the maple is a tree found
only in the eastern half of the country.
Some Progressive Conservatives who
are openly critical of the maple leaf
design and vehemently in favor of
sticking with the Red Ensign are bubb-
ling with the expectation of electoral
gains over the flag issue. They feel the
country is sufficiently divided over the
issue that they would stand to gain on it.
One Tory said the Liberals would sweep
Quebec Province on the flag issue, a
statement that prompted another Conser-
vative to claim the Government is taking
just another step backward to satisfy the
demands of French Quebec.
One Maritimes MP says most of his
constituency mail is coming from old
United Empire Loyalist groups, repre-
senting the descendants of refugees from
the American Revolution, and from the
Imperial Order of Daughters of the
Empire. Strangely enough, he went on,
new immigrants from Scotland and
Northern Ireland are bitterly opposed to
any idea or suggestion of incorporating
the Union Jack in a Canadian flag. “They
want no symbol suggesting the old idea
of colonialism,” he said. To which
French Quebecers echo “Amen”, for
they are just as adamantly opposed to
the incorporation of the fleur-de-lis, or
Bourbon symbol of New France in a
new Canadian flag. One wit has suggest-
ed a simple solution —a plain white flag
with the word FLAG printed on one
side and DRAPEAU on the other.
★ ★ ★
The Canadian Government is trying
to push through a rather doubting and
reluctant Parliament a Bill designed to
extend the country’s territorial sea on
both the Pacific and Atlantic coasts, and
to establish a 12-miles exclusive off-
shore fishing zone.
The doubts expressed by Opposition
parties do not stem from disagreement
with the principles involved, but arise
from questions of the legality of the
move in international law, and of Can-
ada’s ability to implement its decision.
The Government's reply, expressed by
Secretary of State for External Affairs,
Mr Paul Martin, and Minister of Fish-
eries, Mr Hedard Robichaud, is that
negotiations with countries whose fish-
ing fleets would be affected are proceed-
ing satisfactorily, and with reasonable
hope of success.
Canada’s territorial sea, as recognised
until now by this country and by all
others, has been the traditional three
miles, measured from a heavily-indented
and irregular coastline on both oceans.
The Government was a strong supporter
of proposals advanced at the Geneva
conferences on the law of the sea in
1958 and 1960, and claims to have been
the first to propose at the General


Assembly of the UN in 1956 that terri-
torial seas should be 12 miles from the
coastline instead of three.
The Geneva conferences failed to win
international agreement for the principle
of wider territorial seas. Canada now has
decided to act unilaterally, provided it
can win diplomatic acceptance from
countries that would be affected.
Canada’s action does not stem from
narrow nationalism, but from fear that
her fisheries may be in danger of deple-
tion by large European and Soviet fish-
ing fleets crowding in indiscriminately
where certain Canadian fishing boats are
banned by Canadian fisheries conserva-
tion regulations. For example, Canadian
trawlers more than 65 feet in length, and
able to stay at sea longer and make
larger catches, are prohibited from fish-
ing inside the 12-mile limit. The Cana-
dian regulations, of course, do not apply
to foreign fishing vessels thus caus-
ing discontent and claims of discrimina-
tion.
/Canada’s diplomats are negotiating for
acceptance of the 12-mile limit with
the United States, France, Portugal,
Spain, Norway, Denmark, Britain and
Italy, all of which have fishing fleets that
come close to Atlantic shores, and with
Japan in the Pacific.
All these countries, except the US
and France, which have treaty rights,
claim historical fishing rights. TTe Gov-
ernment rejects the idea of historical
fishing rights, but has no desire to break
the treaty rights giving US and French
fishermen freedom of inshore fisheries in
some sections of the Gulf of St. Law-
rence and the western shores of New-
foundland.
Some accommodation must be found
with the US and France without actually
sending the treaties, which pre-date Con-
federation in 1867, to the scrap heap.
Canada hopes to measure its new ter-
ritorial seas outward from straight base-
lines drawn from headland to headland,
and has made it clear that such large
areas of fishing grounds as the Bay of
Fundy and the Gulf of St Lawrence on
the Atlantic Coast, and Queen Charlotte
Sound on the Pacific Coast would be in-
cluded.
Mr J. Angus Mac Lean, former Con-
servative Minister of Fisheries and strong
advocate of international conventions on
the law of the sea, has warned that the
new limits, once promulgated by Order
in Council, will not stand up to fisher-
men's acceptance, and that Canada will
face some legal complications that may
end up in the International Court of
Justice. Mr Martin, however, claims that
Government experts have listed 42
countries that claim territorial sea limits
greater than three miles and some 23
countries that claim fishing limits
greater than the territorial limits, (ofns.)
Sweden’s Double Agent
44 Spying for its own sake ”
From ANDREW WILSON and ROLAND HUNTFORD
in Stockholm
Colonel Stig Wennerstroem, the
self-confessed spy on whom sen-
tence has been passed in Stock-
holm, does not fit any of the usual con-
cepts of a traitor. He was not led to
spying by political idealism. He had
no known weaknesses for alcohol,
women or boys through which he
might have been blackmailed. Nor did
he need money.
But he had one flaw which the Rus-
sians quickly recognised: a yearning to
associate with people of power—a kind
of power that could hardly exist in
neutral Sweden. Stig Erik Constans
Wennerstroem was born into a respected
Swedish family in 1912 and was destined
for the armed forces. Among military
families he entered a caste whose honor
and position in society were unques-
tioned, like those of Prussian military
families across the Baltic.
This tradition, whose vestiges still
survive, explains why Wennerstroem was
able to work undetected as a spy for
nearly 18 years.
Wennerstroem joined the Swedish
Navy as a midshipman in 1929 but
transferred to the Air Force two years
later. According to a heavily censored
document released last week, he says his
first contact with espionage was in 1933
when the Air Force sent him to Riga,
in Latvia, to study Russian. Riga was
then full of emigre White Russian
families, with one of whom he lived.
It was also the chief listening post for
news out of Russia, a nest of agents and
counter-agents.
Asa result of this visit, apart from ac-
quiring fluent Russian and German,
the 26-year-old second lieutenant seems
to have picked up an absorbing interest
in spying for its own sake—a fact noted
later by his superiors and interpreted as
an interest in security work. Former
colleagues say he was not cut out to be
a good commanding officer, but he had
obvious administrative abilities. His
spying began in 1940 when he was sent
as air attache to Moscow. There he
made contact with his German opposite
number, for whom, according to his own
account, he was able to obtain informa-
tion about the area between Murmansk
and Leningrad for Hitler’s invasion of
Russia.
This, if true, had a remarkable sequel:
for Wennerstroem was named as a “use-
ful contact” in the records of the Ger-
man intelligence organisation of General
Rheinhard Gehlen. When the Gehlen
organisation was taken over by the
Americans after the war, Wennerstroem
according to his statement to the
police—was approached by contacts at
the United States Embassy in Stockholm
to continue his work. He says he agreed
and carried out missions during official
visits to Leningrad and Moscow in
1946. He also agreed to supply the
Americans with information about tar-
gets for their Strategic Air Command
when he went again as air attache to
Moscow in 1948. This activity stopped
when, because of “American laxity”
over coding procedures, he was un-
masked by the Russians in 1949.
TlTennerstroem’s real espionage work
started some time before this when,
as a double agent, he had already begun
to work for the Russians. According to
his deposition, before leaving for Mos-
cow he contacted the Soviet military
attache in Stockholm, a Col. Rubat-
chenko. He was already known at the
Soviet Embassy, which he had visited
often during the war. These visits had
interested the Swedish security police,
who thought he was spying for the
Russians and tapped his telephone.
But Wennerstroem was not then spy-
ing for the Russians: he was spying for
the Germans. The telephone-tapping
yielded nothing and was stopped. In
1944 he was promoted Major, and in
1946 Lieutenant-Colonel. He had now
been cleared by Security and could join
the General Staff, which gave him access
to the most secret documents. He con-
tinued to be protected by this prestige
of the officer corps. Wennerstroem says
his first deal with the Russians was when
he sold them the plans of a secret
Swedish airfield for 5,000 kronor (about
£350).
From there, apparently spurred on by
bitterness over failing to get promotion
to the rank of full Colonel, he went on
to a 14-year career of spying in Stock-
holm, Moscow and Washington.
Wennerstroem was arrested on
August 20 as he was crossing Gustav
Adolf Square in the centre of Stock-
holm. His trial began on April 9 and,
apart from the formal charge on the
first day, has been held in camera.

Even in comopolitan Switzerland it is
rather surprising to encounter, in
the higher reaches of the Toggen-
burg valley, a group of Tibetan children
singing a lively marching song on their
way to school.
There are now six Tibetan communi-
ties in eastern Switzerland at villages in
those valleys off the beaten track of
tourism. Under arrangements made by
the Swiss Red Cross, about 100 more
Tibetan refugees, from the 35,000 now
living in India, will be arriving here
during the next few months. This will
bring the total to more than 300, plus
some 150 orphans placed with Swiss
families.
Typical of those expatriate communi-
ties is “Tibeterheim Ennethur”, a big
chalet on the hillside above Unterwasser,
which, since last May, has sheltered
40 men, women and children, including
two lamas who give the children
religious instruction in the evenings but
during the day work at a textile mill
further down the valley.
A dozen other men have been found
jobs as carpenters, market gardeners and
laborers one as an electrician. The
two oldest ones, well into their sixties,
cope with some of the heavier domestic
chores in the chalet. Being skilled tail-
ors, they also make and repair clothes
for members of the community.
In addition, they maintain permanent
supervision over the large cans to be
found under several beds in the dormi-
tories. These contain maize or rice beer,
slowly fermenting to be ready for the
feast days that are observed here with
songs and dancing, as they were in Tibet
itself with the difference that such
occasions are now generally compressed
into a single evening.
Their Swiss employers say that the
Tibetans learn quickly and are good
workers once they have understood
that toil here is disciplined and that they
may no longer curl up and go to sleep
in a corner if they feel tired.
The language difficulties are formid-
able, except in the village school, whose
teacher found himself confronted last
autumn with seven brown-eyed youngs-
ters. The eldest, aged 13, spoke some
English, but otherwise they knew no
word of any tongue other than their
own.
Today, they are fluent enough in Swiss
German to take their place beside Swiss
children in the classroom and both
the latter and the teacher have acquired
a smattering of Tibetan. Two of the boys
hope to go on later to university and
study medicine “so that we can be use-
ful to our people”.
The adults, too, have, on the whole,
settled down well, the climate being
much to their liking, and are demonstra-
ting how quickly a people, traditionally
distrustful of foreigners, can adapt


TAXI
STAND
FACTS
o
Here are the reasons why
oyer 6,000 men in the taxi
industry protest against
the Government's new
policy on taxi plates:
• The Government is taking away rights it granted in 1955 to
transfer taxi piate licences in return for the establishment of
the two-way radio system.
9 An investment built up over years o.f hard work and long hours
may now be wiped out overnight by departmental action. Those
who will suffer most will be the families of thousands of men
and women depending on the taxi industry for their livelihood.
9 Motor Transport Commissioner, Mr. Walsh, has declared the
new policy is to ensure that taxi plate licences are kept in the
hands of persons who will drive the vehicles. Surely the needs
of wives and widows and their children are important too?
9 Each year taxis carry over 100,000,000 passengers in New South
Wales; 17,000,000 are called for at addresses.
9 For years taxi operators have had to cope with outdated regu-
lations, petty prosecutions, traffic hazards—now they are to
lose rights which they were assured would be preserved.
9 The taxi industry asks only for a square deal. It was promised—
by the Minister himself. A departmental letter says so. Read
it for yourself!

... my wife’s idea
Put a glass of St. Agnes in his hand—and watch that twinkle of approval
in his eye. You know you ve done the right thing in having a bottle
of St. Agnes Brandy in the cupboard. St. Agnes is pure, clean and dry.
The words pure and clean probably describe St. Agnes better than any
other brandy. The very name St. Agnes’ was chosen to signify this
purity and cleanliness.
Make sure you are ready to meet the occasion make sure that you
keep a bottle of St. Agnes Brandy in your cupboard. Order a bottle from
your local supplier.

themselves to a completely different way
of life. They also have completely over-
come class barriers among themselves—
one of the women, who takes her turn
in the kitchen at preparing food as near
as possible to what they would eat in
Tibet except for some of the more
exotic spices grew up in a Lhasa
family mansion with 40 servants.
Butter tea and devil masks
JJ'he men’s earnings go into a com-
munal fund, from which they receive
50 shillings monthly spending money
and the women 35 shillings. A few of
the men from communities at other
villages, who came from India two
years ago, have bought themselves bi-
cycles on which they ride to work and
also, at the weekends, visit their fellow-
countrymen in other valleys. One of
them, informing his employer that on
the way back to work he had knocked
over a woman pedestrian, shrugged off
the incident by saying, “No matter, she
old.” The woman, fortunately, was not
hurt, and the local police showed under-
standing.
In general, such manifestations of
especially Tibetan characteristics are
confined within the walls of the com-
munities' chalets, most of which are now
being enlarged to accommodate new
arrivals. Innumerable cups of salty but-
ter tea are drunk beneath pictures of
the Dalai Lama; gaily painted masks are
mounted on walls to ward off the evil
eye; ornate jugs are kept replenished
with water from the hill streams in
religious observance; still regarded as
especially propitious for any fresh
endeavor are the Bth, 10th, 25th and
30th days of the month.
On the walls, too, are signs of how
the new civilisation around them is mak-
ing its impact: magazine photos showing
the latest styles for women and children
and modernistic furniture. This is in
sharp contrast to the traditional dress to
which the women still cling one of
them, from a nomadic tribe in the
Karakorum Mountains, proudly showed
me her broad leather belt, with pockets
for lucky charms, spoons, knives and
needles. Others have chains round their
necks with charm boxes. The men, how-
ever, wear ordinary jackets and trousers;
only the lamas change into robes in the
evening.
Nostalgic memories of a similar instru-
ment heard among the high mountains
of Tibet are aroused on a Sunday after-
noon, when Swiss alpenhorn players
gather for practice, and deep, mellow
notes echo across the Unterwasser valley.
Memories, though, are only for the
adults. The children, instead, look to a
future bright with what for their fathers
were unimaginable new prospects.

Around Melbourne
A NOBLE [£10m.?] HOME FOR A NOBLE GAME
week the secretary of the Vic-
torian Football League, Mr Eric
McCutchan, said: “I have heard it
said that in April Melbourne awakes,
and that the long dark night since
September has ended.” You might
say that right now dear Melbourne
is in a state of high noon. On June
8 Sir Kenneth Luke, president of the
VFL, held a cocktail party for the
Press and all those present received
a beautifully produced color brochure
which began:
“OUR GAME: It happened dur-
ing World War 11. A soldier, one of
the gamest players in the VFL, came
home on leave from the murderous
business going on in New Guinea.
His club, in dire war-time straits, wel-
comed him exuberantly and asked him
to strip that very next Saturday after-
noon. He played that day—played
as if his life depended on it. When
the siren sounded the boy bent down
and scooped up a handful of grass and
earth from his home ground. Curious
team mates asked him why . . .
‘Well, I’d like to take a bit of our
ground and the game I love back
with me next time,’ he replied. He
never came back . . .”
This was interesting, but the main
point of the brochure was to give the
first details of the Waverley project
and, in particular, its main feature,
“VFL Park”. It certainly looked a
beauty. Let’s give you a few lines:
“This is the Stadium. Splendid . . .
it will be the largest sporting arena
in the English-speaking world . . .
the total capacity will be 157,000
people . . . the view of the playing
area will be completely unobstructed
by pillars . . . the playing arena will
be ablaze from powerful lighting
located in the banks of the cantilever
roof.
“Within the Stadium there will also
be a main function room to hold 1150,
a restaurant seating 700 persons,
committee rooms and a vice-regal
room. Press, television and radio
will bring the drama of events at
Waverley to the nation, and beyond
our shores . . . parking space for
25,000 . . . pedestrian ramps . . .
private boxes for 2,200 ... in this
immense stadium the VFL will have
an edifice as noble in spirit as the
game it sponsors,”
You are sceptical, perhaps? Well,
the financial committee comprises
Sir Kenneth Luke, Sir Maurice
Nathan, Sir lan Potter, Messrs A. J.
Moir, E. A. Jones and D. T. William-
son. It has been our humble experi-
ence that when you get a committee
with such names dreams really come
true. The idea is that the first stage
of the centre, a stadium to hold
76,400, will be completed in 1967
and ready for matches in 1968.
tpHE cost of the first stage is put at
-*• £ll million, and the big hope is
to play the finals there in 1972 after
the agreement expires with the MCC.
The old hands are a little puzzled
as to how the VFL will make a suc-
cess of this thing. You, see, the MCC
has its own building plans. Before
the next Test tour it is hoping to re-
build the Grey Smith stand to give
seats to 24,600 plus standing room
to 8000. Cost: £1 million. Com-
pare this to costs at VFL—price for
the first stage to 76,400, £li million.
How will the VFL get out of it so
cheaply? Some of the old MCC
hands believe that by the time VFL
Park gets to 150,000 they’ll be up
for £8 to £lO million. Eventually
the money will have to come from the
clubs.
What’s more, the dear old MCC,
which was considered one of the
world's best cricket grounds back in
1862 when WG was a babe, is within
walking distance of Flinders Street
and right on the rail and tram routes.
Waverley is 15 miles from Melbourne
and several miles from the nearest
railway station. Bus transport would
have to be superb. Of course, the
MCG also has a third stage plan on
the books. Stage two will take it to
between 120.000 and 130,000. Stage
three, once expected to come about
within 10 years, would take it to
150,000 more.
But, alas, without the promise of
VFL crowds it would be hard to see
this ever coming about.
However, the battle for the grounds,
as in every State, is an old one. The
brochure says too: “The fact is that
no ground is owned by a League
football club or the League itself.
Only Collingwood and Geelong have
been granted management rights. Ad-
mittance prices, the length of the
season, and facilities provided for
the paying public, are all beyond the
control of the VFL and its constitu-
ent clubs . . . after a century of vir-
tually being a boarder the time has
arrived when it (VFL) should have
a home of its own, where it can be
a landlord in its own right.”
So the VFL is claiming that it
could make a greater profit from a
crowd of say, 72,000, at its own
ground than from 125,000 at the
MCG, because they would all be
paying customers and the 12i per
cent rental would not come out of
the gate. This rather ignores the fact
that MCC members do have to pay
the VFL out of their membership
fees.
Ah yes, the Waverley Centre will
be in a huge and growing population
centre with two ancillary ovals, faci-
lities for squash, basketball, table
tennis, swimming and gymnastics;
everything, dear reader, except cric-
ket. And that's a saddening thought.

The Great Defence Humbug
Why don’t we put up or shut up?
By J. D. B. MILLER
(Professor of International Relations, Australian National University)
The generals are usually supposed to
be fighting the last war, and it may
be true; but in Australia the public
often seem to be fighting the last but
one or two when it talks about defence.
The biggest recent stimulus to up-to-
date thinking on defence was given by
some of the papers at the January
Summer School of the Australian Insti-
tute of Political Science, now published
in book form.*
There seem to be two strands in our
traditional defence thinking: whom to
depend on abroad, and what to do with
our volunteer troops in time of war.
The question of dependence has been
central to Australian thinking: we have
never assumed that we' could defend
our country alone against a great power,
and in 1942 we simply switched from
Britain to the United States m the choice
of someone to hang on to. There has
really been little argument about this
dependence, in spite of the shock
which Mr Curtins New Year Message
of 1942 caused in some circles.
The other strand in our defence
thinking has occasioned much more ex-
citement, as one can tell from reading
the Official Histories of the two World
Wars and such books as John Hether-
ington's “Blarney”. Our Government
and generals have been constantly in
strife with the British and American
Governments about where Australian
troops shall serve, under what condi-
tions, with what recognition, and with
what Australian control over planning.
It may well be that this is still import-
ant to the Australian military mind; tra-
ditions are formed by past controversies,
and the struggles for recognitition of
Australian military capacity may be re-
garded as unfinished. The main point,
however, is that we have always so far
considered fighting as something to be
done by volunteers—soldiers, sailors and
airmen. Conscripts are people who stay
at home. This is quite unlike the think-
ing of most countries in the matter.
Their view is that soldiers are people
whom you employ, compulsorily if neces-
sary to be ready to defend you. Ours
is that there are two sorts of soldiers,
one whom you recruit once a war starts
in order to be launched against the
enemy six months later, and another
whom you may or may not have around
in peace-time, but whom you do not take
seriously, even if compulsion is involved.
The trouble with this whole frame of
reference is that it is out of date. The
dependence strand is right enough, but
it has to be recognised as ultimate de-
pendence, which does not necessarily
solve immediate problems. Dependence
on the United States is all very well so
far as an all-out war against Communist
China is concerned; but this is not the
sort of war that we have on our hands.
The Borneo war and the Indo-China
war are being fought by our great and
powerful friends, not on our behalf, but
on theirs. The fact that we might be
benefited by what they do is incidental.
The important point is that we are dis-
qualified from a major voice in policy
on these significant problems so close to
Australia because we do not contribute
more than token forces to their solu-
tion. Of course, we are not disqualified
altogether; but we are likely to find that
“diplomatic skill”, the resource to which
Sir Garfield Barwick gave such emphasis
in his Canberra paper, is simply not
enough without “the pain and tribula-
tion of devoting manpower and financial
resources to building of armed forces
proportionate to our capacity and our
obligations”, as Sir Alan Watt put it in
commenting on the Barwick paper
The backaround to this lies in part
in the secoad slrand of our t ’ radi ,V na i
thinking: we have no tradition of keep-
ing troo readi | available in
t j me Instead we think of war as
something that’happens a long wav off
and can be approached at leisure >er-
hapSj too? we think of it as somethi
big; small wars are not yet assimilated
into OLir thinking. We are ready now to
spend heavily on planes and ships, but,
in the situation which exists, we need
infantrymen holding the ground that
they sit on, as Dr T. B. Millar showed
at Canberra; these we have not got, and
we show little sign of getting them,
What stops us?
There seems to be three reasons at
least, some better than others. One is
dependence on “diplomatic skill” to get
us what we want. Historically speaking,
diplomacy is still a new toy for us.
We have found that it is a nice toy to
use, and that we use it well. Our diplo-
mats are skilled; our Department of
External Affairs has more brains than
any other in the Government. We rely
upon diplomatic skill in some matters,
such as Indonesia and Indo-China, be-

cause they are not clear-cut from our
point of view, and we wish to exercise
modifying influences of various kinds.
But we also rely upon it because, in our
quest for peace through dependence, we
have got ourselves into ANZUS, SEATO
and ANZAM commitments which, to-
gether with our commitments to defend
Australia and New Guinea, are potenti-
ally immense. Whether we intend it or
not, our diplomatic skill has to be used
to see that we are not called upon to
meet these commitments. The world
will hardly arrange itself to suit such a
peculiar demand as this from such a
small country as ours.
A second reason which may find favor
with Treasury and Cabinet is expense.
It is surprising how often this is men-
tioned in Canberra conversations, in
spite of the manifest signs of abounding
prosperity and taxable capacity. Pro-
fessor Downing’s paper at the January
School showed how little of our gross
national product goes on defence forces,
and how easy it would be to increase
expenditure without making a significant
dent in standards of living. No doubt
an increase in taxes would trouble many
people and might cause objections from
newspapers. But the present Menzies
Government has more reason to believe
it can stand the strain than any other
peace-time Government in Australian his-
tory.
A third reason, perhaps the most im-
■*"*- portant in affecting Government deci-
sions, is public opinion. No-one knows
what this is, of course, but there is a
vague feeling in governmental circles
that any increase in our ground forces
would have to be met from conscripts
and that public opinion would not stand
for this. Our traditional reliance on volun-
teers is brought in evidence, along with
the fuss over conscription for overseas
service in both World Wars. There is
no doubt about the volunteer tradition.
But it is possible that too much stress
is laid on the conscription bogy. This
may be a thing of the past. Its virulence
in World War I was due to two features
of that time which are not to be seen
now: the fact that a Labor Government
was in office, and the fact that many,
perhaps most, of the Irish-Catholic popu-
lation of Australia were against conscrip-
tion for reasons connected with Ireland.
Neither of these ought to worry Sir
Robert Menzies in the circumstances of
today. He could also take comfort from
the fact that, in World War 11, a Labor
Government got away with conscription
for service in areas near Australia with-
out Catholic bother, with only minimal
trouble from the Labor movement, and
with none from the electorate.
However, the conscription issue is
complicated not only by wartime experi-
ence but also by what has happened
in peace-time.- The Australian tradition
of peace-time compulsion is not selective
service but a grab-all conscription of
18-year-olds, which is advocated as
much for its possible effects on juvenile
delinquency, as for its value in training
soldiers. The more it is advocated for
its effect in “making a man” of delin-
quent teenagers, the less likely it is to
be acceptable or useful as a means of
defence. The army is not a place where
you learn perpetual physical jerks; it is
one in which you learn to kill people
without being killed yourself. It is a
serious business. Only limited numbers
of men can be trained effectively at any
one time without entirely depleting the
Regular Army, and they need to be
kept in the forces for some years if they
are to be of use. Selective service,
suggested by Dr Millar at Canberra and
immediately confused by most commen-
tators with the traditional compulsory
service, is what is needed. Voluntary
enlistment will not suit the becoming
economic conditions of Australia.
It is difficult to believe that the
Government has resolutely faced this
point. Its military advisers might be
expected to have put it with some force.
However, if Dr Beddie’s Canberra paper
is correct, and the Cabinet is protected
from the professional military men by
cohorts of public servants, it is possible
that the matter has not been faced with
any brutality. Top Australian public
servants are now among the best in the
world, but they still prefer a quiet life
to one in which too much is happening.
Selective service, with its creation of a
large full-time force permanently in
existence in Australia and frequently
to be found abroad, would create very
great problems for the administration—
problems of finance, of the disposition
of resources, of the chains of command,
of co-ordination with other departments
of Government, of land and labor and
capital. It is possible that both politi-
cians and public servants have shrunk
from the implications of such a decision,
preferring to take refuge in the thought
of dependence, in diplomatic activity,
and in the tradition of voluntarism.
Nevertheless, it needs saying that our
present position in the world looks very
much like humbug. We support the
United States and Britain, presumably
because this seems the best way of de-
terring an ultimate Chinese attack: on
Australia or Chinese moves which would
isolate Australia and leave it defenceless.
We practise diplomacy which leads us
to express this support in definite terms
which include or imply military support.
But we do not provide the military sup-
port. What we do provide is no doubt
welcome in its place, but it did not assist
British troops in Borneo or provide more
than token help in Vietnam. Yet our
Government speaks in terms which
suggest that both these causes are just;
not only just, but also closer to Austra-
lia's interests, because of its geographical
location, than to either Britain’s or the
United States’ in the long run. Does
this not look like humbug? It is not
meant to be, but our associates abroad
can be forgiven if they describe it as
such. Perhaps we should put up or
shut up.
TTaving more forces would not be just
a matter of sacrifice. Our diplomats
would certainly Teel freer to exercise
their skill if they had some troops to
back it. The idea of some sort of mili-
tary guarantee to an independent New
Guinea would be more practicable than
it is now. With proper air and sea sup-
port, we could perform the sort of feat
that the British are now able to perform
with their “ever-readies”. We should not
have to leave our troops in the one place
for a long time (as now in Malaya) be-
cause of nothing with which to replace
them.
Also, if we wished, we could go into
the peace-keeping business like Canada
and Ireland. This is the sort of thing to
which Australia ought to be well suited.
Our troops would get experience in
strange places—especially with strange
languages, one of the bugbears of
operating with allies in real wars. By
following the Canadian lead, we could
look as if we thought of others some-
times, and not just of ourselves. Our
present position may be the understand-
able result of our history and circum-
stances, but it still looks like selfishness.
One can argue that all countries are
ultimately selfish in their policies; but it
is a mistake to look consistently selfish.
All the signs point in the direction of
our needing more forces if we want to
cut more ice. Of course, the forces in
themselves would not improve our posi-
tion. We might use them foolishly, or
fail to train them properly, or get stuck
halfway in a programme which had to
be carried through to the end if it was
to be of use. We might use our diplo-
matic skill in pursuit of fruitless policies.
But the conclusion (which was very
much the prevailing mood at the Can-
berra School in January) is that without
more forces very little progress can be
made.

AID TO TOKYO GAMES TEAM
Brambles Industries Limited has become an Official Sponsor to the 1964
Australian Olympic Team and has been presented with the display banner seen
below.
When the Games open in Tokyo for
the 16-day season on October 10, Aus-
tralia hopes to have 180 athletes in the
field. For the essentials only, it costs
£540 to send and maintain each sports-
man and woman at Tokyo. The grand
total will be £110,000 for competitors
and a small number of officials.
Australian Governments have in-
dicated that they will make contribu-
tions, but the bulk of the finance will
come from business and sporting com-
munities. The Brambles donation will
cover one athlete for the complete
journey. The expenses of equipment
and training are borne by the contestant
himself and the amateur sporting
association to which he belongs.
The Olympic Contest will have its
2,700th birthday this year. Brambles are
proud to be able to help Australians to
take part in the ancient tradition.

MATERIALS HANDLING
Better Techniques Reduce Handling Costs
By G. S. J. COLE *
The term — “MATERIALS HAND-
LING" has been defined as “the art
and science of moving, packaging and
storing of substances in any form.” If this
is accepted, then it follows that the aims
of .Materials Handling can be identified
with production, storage and distribu-
tion.
With the rapid growth of industry,
production facilities must expand, and
with the increased flow of commodities,
the handling of materials constantly
presents more costly and complex
problems. Methods, systems and pro-
cedures once considered satisfactory
often prove to be inadequate to satisfy
the demands of the more efficient
modern production methods, and this is
particularly true of this country.
Leaders of industry today are seriously
concerned with the spiralling costs of
Materials Handling, and are constantly
seeking new ways of restraining the
rising costs in this field. A survey of
Britain just prior to 1962 revealed that
30 per cent of the country's wage bill
was expended in Materials Handling
during the course of manufacture, and
there is no reason to suppose that this
figure is not exceeded in Australia.
The following main factors contribute
to the costs of Materials .Handling:
1. The costs of owning, maintain-
ing and operating equipment.
2. The costs of operating a
system.
3. The costs of storage, transport
and distribution.
With today's highly competitive
markets, a closer watch on the formid-
able costs involved in Materials Hand-
ling is being forced upon those re-
sponsible, and the question must often
be asked:
“DO WE KNOW OUR HANDLING
COSTS?”
Whatever the present handling opera-
tion, whether adequate or not, a com-
plete Knowledge of its cost, should be
obtained. The costs, once investigated,
should be isolated, tabulated and readily
identifiable in the accounting system at
all times.
In order to develop a more efficient
Materials Handling system, or to analyse
the existing method, some basic facts
must be known and the following
relationship established:
The Total Materials Handling Costs
— To All Costs.
The Total Materials Handling
Labour Costs —- To All Labour
Costs.
The Total Materials Handling
Equipment Costs — To All
Equipment Costs.
Materials Handling Equipment Idle
Hours — To Total Hours.
Work in Progress •—- To Monthly
Sales.
Cubic Space Used — To Cubic
Space Available.
Other specific relationships will be
necessary in particular circumstances,
and the cost ratios extracted will vary
considerably in different industries, but
the results could, and often do, reveal
unexpected information to Manage-
ment.
Once the present system has been
analysed and all relevant cost figures are
known, it will be generally acknow-
ledged that improvement must be
effected.
Once this is accepted, the problem
must be faced, but only after the real
problem has been identified. The correct
approach to analysing the problems is
vital; it must be placed in true pers-
pective, and will need skilful and
detailed investigation.
When completed and analysed, the
outcome, of a Materials Handling in-
vestigation should result in one or most
of the following basic objectives being
reached:
REDUCE COSTS
Direct Labour.
Indirect Labour.
Materials Process.
Decreased Inventory.
Waste and Damage.
INCREASE CAPACITY
Space Utilization.
Improved Lay-out.
Equipment Utilization.
Downtime Through Lack of

Increase Productivity per man

Increase Equipment and Machine

ditions.
Reduce Work Fatigue.
IMPROVE DISTRIBUTION
Decrease Damage.
Improve Routing.
Maintain Time Schedules.
Improve Storage.
Reduce Overall Delivery Time.
SALES ABILITY
Customer Service.
Preservation of Quality.
Customer Appeal.
Commodity Presentation.
MATERIALS HANDLING is a
scientific study that calls for an accurate
analysis of methods, a sound knowledge
of the product in question and all opera-
tions related to it, the simplification and
integration of those operations, the use
of modern management techniques, a
wide experience and creative thinking.
It poses a challenge to management and
is the key to substantial economies.

CHEP Cranes Called:
Biggest Clear-Span
In New South Wales
Randwick Council has a new trans-
port depot—and one which will provide
the most free trafficways of any in the
State. The depot design provides for
an un-supported roof span 170 feet
across, to give maximum clear space on
the floor. Depth of the depot is 250
feet divided into eleven bays.
CHEP were engaged by Wimpey
Conder Pty. Ltd. for the steel erection
of the building. This involved the erec-
tion of the columns and the lifting and
placing of 11 double trusses, each weigh-
ing 7i tons over a span of 170 ft.
CHEP riggers skilfully undertook the
erection of the complete project which
requires the placing of the columns, the
lifting and securing of the 1\ ton
trusses, the associated “plumbing up”
and final bolting.
Rail Forwarding
Forty-five per cent of goods for-
warded by Brambles’ customers between
Melbourne and Sydney now goes by
rail.
This substantial increase over former
years results from the economies
achieved in the highly successful opera-
tion of the uniform gauge link between
the two capitals.
Brambles Melbourne rail terminal
(see picture) has on-the-spot control of
all services required by the customers.
Fork lift trucks speed handling of
consignments, and radio control of
Brambles road vehicles ensures a fast
and efficient feeder service.
The same rail terminal facilities are
operated by Brambles in all mainland
capital cities.

TO ASIA —
With Characters
When Mr. Syd. Ferguson sailed
to Asian ports aboard the Trade
Ship “Centaur” he took Brambles
literature printed in three languages
— English, Chinese and Japanese.
Mr. Ferguson, General Manager
of Brambles Customs and Shipping
Division, was a member of the ship-
board executive in his capacity of
Honorary Customs Adviser, and rep-
resented his Company’s interests
during the voyage.
On his return Mr. Ferguson said:
“The visit of the Trade Mission was
an unqualified success. A great deal
of business was written and members
of the Mission not only gained most
valuable information of requirements
in this area for Australian goods and
services but, more importantly,
learned of the great goodwill existing
in these countries towards Australia.”
He found that translation of his
Company’s brochure into the main
Oriental languages greatly facilitated
his discussions with our agents and
clients abroad.

It is announced with deep regret
that the death occurred in Newcastle
last month of Mr. J. H. (Bert) Gib-
son, Manager of Brambles’ Foundry
unit, James Tickle & Sons Pty.
Limited.
A colorful personality, Mr. Gib-
son had worked with the Company
for 35 years. He is survived by his
widow and two sons.
The very large attendance at the
funeral service was an impressive and
fitting tribute to the standing of Mr.
Gibson in the social and commercial
life of Newcastle.
Custom Unit’s View
of Nation’s Trade
The Brambles Customs and Shipping
unit of Steel & Humphrey Pty. Ltd. has
reported on its bird’s-eye viewpoint of the
variety of Australian exports and imports.
Executives have recently expedited ship-
ments of these Australian engineering
products:
• Salinometers which measure
the amount of salt in sea
water to .003 parts per
million, and which go as far
afield as Iceland.
• Steel grinding balls for
copper, zinc and cement mill-
ing which go to the Philip-
pines and Hong Kong.
• Concrete mix agitators bound
for road vehicles in Marseilles
and other European ports.
One of the biggest important assign-
ments of the last twelve months was for
Bradford Cotton Mills. No less than
£2,000,000 worth of spinning equip-
ment came in to modernise the mill at
Kotara, near Newcastle.
Steel & Humphrey handle all Brad-
ford's imports from overseas, including
large quantities of raw cotton.

MOTORING
Unhappily Married?
Then Don’t Drive!
Speed isn’t the only killer on the roads
By BOADICEA
I came across a small news item re-
cently about a research team at Har-
vard University (USA) and its
findings after a four-year study of car
accidents. This, to my thinking, is the
biggest step forward in the battle against
road deaths. Road accidents have been
examined for the first time with the
thoroughness of aircraft accidents as, of
course, they should be.
One of the team’s most sensational
findings will upset police, coroners and
road safety experts, all so adept at
blaming the majority of road deaths on
speed. The researchers found that emo-
tional stress —worry over insecurity, an
unhappy marriage or plain general de-
pression leads to accidents just as
surely as an unroadworthy car. Speed
alone is not the killer, and wasn’t blamed
as the main culprit in America’s yearly
road death-rate of over 40,000.
The research team was composed of
mechanical experts to study the cars in-
volved, road engineers who examined
surfaces and the course of the accident,
pathologists, chemists, sociologists, psy-
chiatrists, optometrists, statisticians,
churchmen and lawyers.
In many cases the fatal drivers had bad
records. One section of the team particu-
larly appealed to me those examiners
of the road surfaces. I have been travel-
ling over some of our roads in the eas-
tern States recently, and I am more con-
vinced than ever that our roads are re-
sponsible for many unexplained deaths.
An example of a needless tragedy oc-
curred when a large truck lurched over
on top of a small sedan, due to broken
road edges. This was one accident with
a survivor who could tell what happened.
Often there are no survivors and speed
takes the blame. Not that I am an ad-
vocate of speed, but it has to be faced,
with faster and more powerful cars being
sold every day.
High cruising speeds on well-surfaced
and designed highways are probably less
dangerous than 40 m.p.h. on that ap-
palling section of the New England High-
way around Stanthorpe and Warwick in
Queensland. This calls for costly major
reconstruction, and no doubt the Queens-
land authorities will tackle it in time.
It is very noticeable that Queensland
roads have improved out of sight in
recent years. Their design is often better
than NSW’s, and repair work seems of
higher quality. Much sensible widening
of the roads, with smooth, firm edges, can
be found in Queensland, while in nor-
thern NSW the edges are broken, pot-
holed and often form a steep drop to the
dirt shoulders.
There has been an immense amount of
road work south of Tamworth which, if
it were correctly surfaced, would be
magnificent. As it is the surface is very
coarse, resulting in high road noise and
energy consuming friction. If this were
“hot mix” with the edges painted white
it would be so much better.
are so many relatively cheap
improvements lacking on our roads
that it makes one wonder just how whole-
hearted are our national and State efforts
to improve matters. The majority of
motorists realise that dual carriageways,
the ultimate in road safety, for they limit
head-on collisions, take years to build
and more money than Australia can
apparently afford. But better road signs,
both directional and warning, are urgent-
ly required, and their cost the authorities
could well afford.
What is more, they will actually save
lives. Our directional signs are pathetic-
ally poor, too few and far too small, and
it always amazes me that any visitor to
Australia can find his way around at all.
What a wonderful help to the New
Englanders the new bridge over the Bluff
River must be. But I couldn’t help think-
ing its width will be insufficient in a few
years’ time. Approaching the bridge from
the north, and looking at the southern
approaches for oncoming traffic, it is
possible to mistake the old road as the
southern approach, which actually is
blind in a cutting. So the lessening of one
hazard has in fact created another.
Faulty road designs are not limited to
our highways; a famous example lies
right in Sydney on the Cahill Express-
way. I refer to the corner around the
Royal Automobile Club building where,
coming from town, the corner is badly
radiused, wrongly cambered and notori-
ously tricky in the wet.
More recently the extension of Kill-
eaton Street from St Ives to North Tur-
ramurra, part of Sydney’s eventual feeder
highways, has the distinction of having
one of the most dangerous corners I have
ever encountered. Coming from St Ives
the longish straight disappears over a
crest to a downhill right-hander with
reverse camber!
One of Australia’s constant road dan-
gers is the repair gang at work or rest.
Almost invariably the warning sign
HALF ROAD CLOSED is placed just
round a fast corner or over a crest. I
came across one slyly hidden round a
corner on a fast descent. Sometimes there
is no warning sign, it has blown over in
the wind or been pinched by larrikins,
and then the motorist is confronted with
the GO-STOP signs operated by one of
the gang. I have suggested once or twice
that these signs could be better placed to
give more warning, but the disinterest
and apathy that greets these suggestions
makes one wonder whether the foreman
has chosen his signallers with Machiavel-
lian cunning.
Perhaps you think I am unfairly harsh.
If so I’d like you to sit in on an inter-
state run, preferably with a camera, and
I am sure I could convince you that very
many of our accidents can be sheeted
home to our roads and that greater in-
telligence as regards the placement of
road signs and warning devices would
lessen the dangers without straining any
national or State purse.
I know of several places on the Hume
and New England Highways where false
crests and “dead ground” are not protect-
ed by double lines. Yet it is incredible but
true that some motorists drive with blind
faith on those lines, never thinking for
themselves but trusting to the wisdom of
the road painter whether it is safe or not
to pass! You might say that while such
motorists exist there is no hope of cutting
the road toll. Maybe so, but isn’t it worth
a try for there is always a chance that
the .family the imbecile driver wipes out
could be yours?


REVIEWS
THE 11th SYDNEY FILM FESTIVAL
A Triumph of Surrealism
...and pictures from Brazil , Yugoslavia , the US and Japan
By MARTIN LONG
Sydney Film Festival, which in
former years was confined wholly or
mainly to a feverish holiday weekend,
this year spreads, with more leisurely
programming, across two weekends. The
first of these ended with most of the
patrons assuming hopefully that the Fes-
tival directors had kept their best attrac-
tions for the second half of the bill.
At the time of writing this year’s festi-
val has provided a couple of talking
points and what appears to be a fairly
good minimum standard among the fea-
ture films (I have not been able to see
them all). But I have neither seen, nor
heard reports of, one really outstanding
full-length film.
It is obviously impossible at this stage
to make a pronouncement on the Festi-
val as a whole. This interim report must
be confined to detached notes on some
of the main films already screened.
The most original and most talked-
about of these is from Mexico: Luis
Bunuel’s “The Exterminating Angel”,
which combines the elements of a sur-
realistic fantasy, a horrifying suspense
drama and a savage satire on human
inadequacies.
The setting is an enormous and luxuri-
ous mansion. As guests arrive for a
dinner party the servants find themselves
inexplicably impelled to leave. At the
end of the evening the guests in their
turn find that they have not the will to
leave the room. For day after day it is
the same: though the door is open they
cannot pass through it, while the people
outside are mysteriously deterred from
entering the house.
With an implacable eye Bunuel ob-
serves the physical and psychological de-
terioration of the imprisoned guests.
The idea is original, the narrative
technique skilful enough to hold sus-
pense. The observation of character is
brilliant and the acting matches it. But
with all this the film does leave a vague
feeling of dissatisfaction. Its basic situ-
ation seems to imply some major revela-
tion or pronouncement that never comes
to pass: instead the film ends with a
macabre twist of the original idea. One
feels that Bunuel has started to play “let’s
pretend” without having thought out
clearly where the game is to end.
Latin America provided another film
“morality”: Brazil's “The Given Word”,
directed by Anselmo Duarte. Though
impressive in its way, this film has a
curiously dated quality that probably
derives mainly from its original source,
a play by Dias Gomes. It holds one’s
sympathy much more strongly if one
doesn’t attempt to relate it to current
cinematic fashions; it fits better with
some of the earnest, sermonising films of
15 years or so ago.
Tt is the story of a simple-hearted
A Brazilian small farmer who carries a
heavy cross to the Church of St Barbara
in the city of Salvador to fulfil a vow
made to the patron saint; the priest of
the church, suspicious of the farmer’s
orthodoxy, forbids him to take the cross
into the church; the situation is whip-
ped up into a political conflict, and dur-
ing a riot the bewildered farmer is shot
down by the police.
If Bunuel’s film is more notable for
the subtlety of its detail than the clarity
of its “message”, in this film the message
is all-important and the characterisation
is reduced mainly to broad simplicities.
Within these limitations, Leonardo
Vilar’s portrayal of the farmer gives a
powerful impression of baffled sincerity,
and the whole film has an undeniable
tragic force.
“The Siberian Lady Macbeth” comes
from Yugoslavia, but has a distinguished
Polish director, Andrzej Wajda, and is
based on a famous Russian story by
Nikolai Leskov, “Lady Macbeth of
Mtsensk” (the film’s title adds another
touch of international confusion; accord-
ing to Leskov no part of the story takes
place in Siberia).
Without Leskov’s vividly economical
writing the tale of the provincial mer-
chant’s wife who murders for love must
become something of a melodrama. But
Wajda (who helped adapt it) directs with
an attentive eye to the graphic touches
of description in the original, combined
with a sure sense of period and atmos-
phere. At its melodramatic level the
total effect is compelling.
The Japanese “My Hobo” is a whim-
sical moral comedy, handsomely shot in
color and Tohoscope, about a philo-
sophical tramp who is converted to con-
formism by two abandoned children and
a pretty confidence-girl. Its mixture of
sentiment, slapstick and moral purpose
seems to classify its writer-director,
Zenso Matsuyama, as a minor Japanese
Capra.
“The Exiles”, a feature-length docu-
mentary about American Indians living
in Los Angeles, has such excellent inten-
tions and so many positive qualities that
one is reluctant to admit that it ends as
a bore.
There is a tragic fascination in the
social problem it exposes: that of half-
assimilated Indians living a beatnik-like,
alcoholic urban existence. Director Kent
Mackenzie captures this with startling
naturalism; but the film is simply too
long and too slow. The maker of it has
become so engrossed with his material
that he has dragged it out beyond the
point where it ceases to surprise or inter-
est us.

Never Too Late. Sumner Arthur Long.
Comedy Theatre. Melbourne.
‘JThe Tulip Tree” is unlikely to win
any prizes, set any new box-office
records, or be remembered in fifty years’
time. Nevertheless, it is an agreeable
play. N. C. Hunter is a thoughtful
observer of his milieu —the English
upper-middle-class—and he has an easy,
if conventional, mastery of his craft.
This play is more consistently intelligent
and interesting than many that have
come to us from the pens of much better
known.contemporary writers.
Colin and Clare Elliot, the principal
characters, have reacted so differently to
the onset of middle age, and to the recent
death of their son, that there is no longer
any real contact between them. Both
are aware of estrangement, and distressed
by it, but neither is able to accommodate
the other —there seems to be no common
ground. During the few months covered
by the action of the play, common
ground is provided—fortuitously, but
quite credibly; and in the process, since
they are intelligent and articulate people,
the Elliots make, and we share, some
small but valuable discoveries about the
limits of responsibility, and the complex
interplay of choice and circumstance.
There is no profundity here, or any
attempt at it. There is some sentimenta-
lity, and a tendency to cliche —we have,

for example, a philosophical family doc-
tor, not very far removed from Doctor
Mac. But, in its total effect, “The Tulip
1 ree is a work of considerable delicacy
and charm.
George Fairfax’s meticulous produc-
tion is distinguished by beautifully
judged performances from Brian James
and Terri Aldred. The supporting play-
ers are admirable, and Paul Kathner has
devised an attractive set.
Like “The Tulip Tree”, “Never Too
Late" is about a middle-aged couple with
a problem, but this one is strictly for
laughs. The Lamberts, Flarry and Edith,
of Calverton, Massachusetts, are unex-
pectedly expecting their second child—
twenty or more years after the birth of
their first. Edith is delighted: Harry is
appalled: Kate and Charlie, their daugh-
ter and son-in-law, look askance: and,
to the accompaniment of a chortling
neighborhood, the walls of domestic
order come tumbling down.
This is a funny-enough situation. It is
exploited with great enthusiasm, and
some skill, over the course of a short
three-acter, although there are a few
labored passages towards the end. The
level of invention is never very high, but
a good pace is maintained throughout,
and the laughs come readily.
Americans fill three of the principal
roles. Neither Milo Boulton as Harry
nor Frank Farmer as Charlie had quite
settled down in the performance I saw,
but both promise well. Mary Orr, as
Edith, is excellent, and Australian Rose-
mary Gerrette fits in comfortably as
Kate. Freddy Carpenter’s direction is
suitably lively and unsubtle.

that, for me at least, the enjoy-
ment of operetta has become purely
nostalgic, it is rather frightening to
think that not so long ago there was a
whole critical apparatus for the pretty
art form. Learned critics could, in those
days, divide the field of operetta into
separate styles of French, Viennese,
German, English. Long and reasonably
heated discussions took place as to the
just position to be accorded such sports
as the Gilbert and Sullivan opera and
the first flowers of American musical
comedy. How far it seems, and strange.
Possibly it was all an escape from
the Nonconformist guilt feelings of
Victorian days; perhaps an attempt to
believe that the Hapsburgs could go on
for many generations yet.
In the ’twenties in Germany, composers
like Stolz and Benatzky tried to bring
the genre closer to real life; they pro-
duced in pieces such as “White Horse
Inn”, a sort of well-worked-over Sing-
spiel and, who knows, along with
“Showboat”, helped the emergence ol
the American musical.
Although I am quite prepared to put
all operetta away in mothballs, I must
admit the present production of Strauss’
“Fledermaus” at the Elizabethan brings
on a strong urge to delay the burial.
Stephen Beinl, the producer, and Des-
mond Digby, the designer, have made
a shining thing of the whole enterprise,
with stunning sets (the cliche is justified)
and some remarkably vivacious acting.
The music is so beguiling, so endlessly
inventive, so integrated with the action,
that I am sure you will forgive whatever
Ruritanian flaws remain in the plot.
Robert Gard, a convert from the
American musicals, is, perhaps, the focus
for all this new freshness and seems to
inspire singers Peter Grant, Mary
O'Brien and, to a lesser degree, Rosalind
Keene into a new realisation of what
even reasonably good acting can do
for a musical play.
A brave new venture into Sydney’s
tough theatre world has been made by
Theatres Associated, an actors’ co-
operative. Their choice for their open-
ing production was perhaps even braver
than their decision to enter management
—for in “By Royal Command” they
staged one of the most urbane and
civilised evenings Sydney has seen in
recent times, an evening which would
grace any capital of the world.
Some excellent anthologist has
gathered a rare and blooming selection
of poems, prose and songs written over
the past six hundred years either by
or about royalty. Most of the evening
is finely satirical, with some bawdy con-
temporary folksongs (beautifully sung
by Tina Date) to add a lusty touch.
From Jane Austen’s little-known but
pure-treasure “History of England”,
written when Jane was 15, with her
avowed purpose “to abuse Elizabeth and
justify that noble woman, Mary”, on to
Horace Walpole’s exquisitely funny des-
cription of that hilarious funeral,
George Ill’s, in which one old Duke
found himself unable to move—from
the heat, he thought, but actually be-
cause another Duke was standing on
his robes to keep his feet off the marble
—from Henry VII sending courtiers to
investigate a possible wife, on to
Victoria asking why there were so few
Viscounts at her coronation Mel-
bourne’s reply: “There are very few
Viscounts, Ma’am”—the evening was a
complete delight and players John Bell,
John Llewellyn, Arthur Dignam, Doreen
Warburton and Anna Volska earned our
highest thanks.

THhe recordings that Bruno Walter
made before his death flow on, as
yet, uninterruptedly; an occasion for
gratitude. The most recent pair of Walter
records from CBS, comprising five works
by Beethoven, Schubert, Brahms and
Mahler, are all well within the tradi-
tions that the conductor knew best; they
may not all be the works of which
every record collector stands in most
need, but they are all interpreted with
the warmth of feeling, devotion to the
score and complete absence of showman-
ship that distinguished all the best Walter
performances.
With scarcely any feeling of guilt I
turned to the Mahler “Songs of a Way-
farer” more gratefully and eagerly than
to the two Brahms works on the oppos-
ing side of the disc. There is no deny-
ing that there are episodes of great
beauty in Brahms’ Alto Rhapsody (a
setting for contralto, male chorus and
orchestra of a passage from Goethe’s
“Winter Journey in the Harz Moun-
tains”), and that in the right perform-
ance and the right mood it can cast a
spell. But I find that the moods in

Stott’s Colleges undertake that no represen-
tative will call following your inquiry.
in this self-consciously austere and
world-renouncing vein are becoming
rarer.
And if the Rhapsody inspires rather
more admiration than affection, the
“Song of Destiny” (which accompanies
it here) hardly seems calculated to inspire
either feeling in much quantity. Yet it
is a little startling to read in a book on
Brahms written 60 years ago that this
latter work was then “perhaps the most
widely loved of all Brahms’ composi-
tions”. The writer gives the clue to this
Edwardian preference by praising
Brahms' choral works first of all for
their “dignity”. In this age dignity is
not the first virtue we look for in music,
and, as we become more appreciatively
aware of the fluid vocal counterpoint of
the Renaissance masters, the solid and
solemn choral music of the 19th cen-
tury appeals less and less.
Thus the feeling of relief, guilty or
not, when we turn over to the youthful
Mahler. The “Wayfarer” songs were
written when Mahler was 23, five years
before the appearance of the first sym-
phony (which quotes from them exten-
sively), but they already reveal his char-
acteristically bright and astringent
orchestral tone, his mixture of world-
liness and folksy naivete, and the fresh,
flowing tunes.
The Mahler songs give richer oppor-
tunities to the excellent soloist, mezzo
Mildred Miller, than the more low-lying
and monochromatic Brahms rhapsody
(which calls for a slightly darker voice).
Here she reveals a splendid range of
emotional sympathy and vocal color.
For anyone whose record collection
still lacks an authoritative Beethoven
“Fifth” or Schubert “Unfinished” the
Walter coupling can be commended as
entirely true to the score and superbly
played. (The only point of performance
that might be questioned is the rather
over-lush, vibrato-laden playing of some
of the Philharmonic woodwinds in the
Schubert slow movement.) The disc is
accompanied by a bonus record of Wal-
ter rehearsing the first two movements
of the Beethoven; though no longer a
novelty, this is still revelatory.
(I notice, by the way, that there is
some highly-colored nonsense in the
jacket notes about Schubert’s reasons
for not finishing the B Minor Symphony,
although all the evidence points to the
fact that the work is truncated rather
than unfinished that Schubert com-
pleted the score, and that the second half
of it has been lost. But legends die
hard when they provide good copy for
annotators.)
With Richter's Schubert recording I
am again perversely inclined to upend
the billing order of the two sides. The
“Wanderer” Fantasia has never spoken
very strongly to me, except in a few of
its more lyrical episodes. Schubert’s
stroke of originality in founding a
sonata-like work on one basic stock of
material (his song, “The Wanderer”) has
to be acknowledged, but Schubert in the
declamatory style that pervades so much
of the work always sounds to me un-
comfortably like Schubert trying to be
someone else.
On the other hand (and the other
side of the record) the A Major Sonata
is one of the most personal and con-
sistently appealing of Schubert’s larger
works: warm, amiably garrulous and
filled with melody.
These possibly cranky views on the
music are of course irrelevant to Rich-
ter’s magnificent performance of both
works. Richter has been accused of being
too “big” and emphatic with Schubert,
but that cannot be said of this disc; the
“Wanderer” calls for bigness, and noth-
ing could be more gentle and affection-
ate than his treatment of the sonata.
Technically, the recording of the piano
is exceptionally fine.
MARTIN LONG
Judy
The Best of Judy Garland. Festival.
Fl-31169-70.
Tudy Garland seems to me the natural
** heir to Ruth Etting and Helen
Morgan, together with Lena Horne the
greatest singer of torch songs to have
emerged since the ’twenties. Despite an
uneven performance at the Sydney Sta-
dium, she came through superbly in
several numbers, and they were always
the autobiographical, sad ones in which
every line of the lyrics was felt as
though it were a personal source of
anguish. “By Myself”, for example—l
shan’t easily forget the fluttering hands
to the throat, the mouth like a wound,
and the harsh, intense dives down the
scale.
On the Festival album, “The Best of
Judy Garland”, the star is at her best:
assured, completely in command, and
barely displaying a trace of the nervous-
ness and strained voice that marred her
performances here. The leaflet enclosed
with the album does not make clear if
these are new studio versions or (as
seems the case) re-pressings of the
original recordings. At any rate, they are
wonderfully fresh and alive, and there
is a veritable feast of numbers from her
best films. As usual, one enjoys the least
known songs the best, because they are
the least time-worn: the Arthur Freed-
Roger Edens “Our Love Affair” is par-
ticularly satisfying, and most warmly
and securely sung. Of old standbys, the
McHugh-Fields “On the Sunny Side of
the Street”, beautifully rearranged from
the old Ruth Etting standard, is perhaps
the most rewarding item on an album
which no addict can do without.

Dissecting the Press
Professor Mayer’s nihilist reappraisal
By DONALD HORNE
The Press in Australia. Henry Mayer.
Lansdowne Press. 755.
ITenry Mayer has done an excellent
job in introducing the Press as a
subject for serious intellectual discussion
in Australia. His nihilism sweeps a lot
of rubbish away; the many facts he has
dug out provide a good broad base for
further detailed digging; and some of
his analytical approaches are original,
that is to say of world class.
A few of Professor Mayer's colleagues
may even consider him a bit of a nut
for going to all this trouble. The Press
has become such a hated symbol of the
kind of things that are said to be wrong
with our age that people who are
thoughtful enough on other occasions
are happy to denounce the Press with-
out thinking about it for more than a
few minutes. It is as if medical scien-
tists so hated disease that they refused
to study the human body.
If they despise the Press without
examining it people are refusing to take
an interest in one of the important
characteristics of our times. Along with
the permanent destruction of certainty
by science and the creation of material
prosperity and massive organisation by
technology, the phenomena of the mass
media provide one of the most import-
ant ways by which we can distinguish
ourselves from the rest of history. Not
to learn about science, technology and
the media is to deny interest in what is
new in our environment.
If intellectuals are analysing a religi-
ous age or a military age they are pre-
pared to go into great detail in exami-
ning military life or religious belief even
if slaughter or superstition repels them.
They will give to the technical problems
of battle order or of dogma a detailed
consideration they will not give to lino-
type machines, unique selling proposi-
tions, zoom lenses or visualisers’ con-
ventions. They give to generals and
cardinals (even when they are obviously
clowns) a seriousness they have refused
in Australia to Press Barons, Movie
Moguls and Advertising Magnates (even
though these cliches suggest significant
comparisons). It is to Professor Mayer’s
credit that his book now changes all
that in Australia.
Or does it? Is he really interested in
the Press? Or is he more interested in
the contention that surrounds it?
Through chapter after chapter he grimly
sprays every least little value judgments
with his nihilist pressure pak until one
wonders how he can so spend his talents
on the destruction of stupidity. After
all, some value judgments can be re-
phrased to become valuable pieces of
description. People get into a bit of a
logical muddle when they are discussing
things, but just because their reasoning
is wrong does not mean that they have
not got on to some interesting facts. If
your major interest in the Press is in
analysing common attitudes to it (as
Professor Mayer says his interest is) part
of that interest may lie in finding the
truth in the descriptive content of these
attitudes as well as the fallacies. (And it
should also lie in detailed analysis of why
people develop these attitudes.)
fJ'HERE is little flesh and blood among
the statistical tables and analysis and
there is not one case study. There is
no real description of what the products
of the Press are like and the analysis
tends to be quantitative rather than
qualitative. One example: an interesting
question such as Why are the Melbourne
Sun and the Sydney Daily Telegraph so
different ? cannot be considered in terms
of quantitative analysis. You can't
measure or analyse it. You have to
describe the differences and then conduct
research into reasons for their existence.
One is dazzled by all these facts from
all over the place being slotted into what
someone has described as a sort of
intellectual terrazzo work. But it would
be interesting if someone would apply
Professor Mayer's formidable intellectual
apparatus (which appears to grow em-
pirically from the facts but sometimes
may only be decorated by them) to one
real, living publishing institution and
write a book about it. I have tested
some of his fine work against my own
ludicrously comprehensive experience
and found him wrong in some cases. To
use the kind of terms he despises, in
some cases he does the Press too little
justice and in others too much.
His whole approach is static. Nothing
moves; nothing changes; it’s all hap-
pened before; it will all go on happening.
It is all very well to laugh at reformers.
But to be determinist is not to deny the
possibility of change; it is merely to
deny that change will necessarily follow
individual wishes. The Press, like the
society of which it is a part, is dynamic;
it is changing. Professor Mayer does
not really know enough about the Press
to say whether it has changed or will
change; his historical summary is too
scrappy to be taken seriously and he
has not investigated trends, differences
and conflict within contemporary Press
institutions—a curious failure in a plura-
list.
It is quite surprising that he has not
used a more sociological approach. He
does not seem to have done any work
of his own in investigating publishing
outfits as social institutions. His obses-
sion with quoting other people's written
words at times limits him to shuffling
around a lot of material of questionable
worth. The 795 quotes that he makes
in his text are not all worth quoting.
He has patched together whole sections
of his book with quotes from people
whose opinions are almost always less
informed than his own so that some parts
read like a send-up of scholarship or an
over-anxious university essay. Why
didn't he talk to some people instead of
just relying on the library?
On a few occasions this quoting ob-
session seems the reverse of scholarship.
For example, on page 31 he says: ‘'Be-
tween 1903 and 1953, ‘while the popu-
lation more than doubled, the number of
newspapers fell by nearly one-third’ 30 ”.
You turn a few pages and look up “ 30 ”
and it refers you to a secondary source.
In a case like this he should have
checked the figures himself. The fact
that “ 30 ” said it is no authority.
It is extraordinary to find that I have
spent so much time criticising a book
that really deserves the highest praise.
This is merely a by-product of taking
it seriously. Although the book starts
lamely most of it displays great brilliance
and the more he says things himself
instead of piecing together other people's
gabble the better it becomes. No one
who wishes to talk about the Press
should now do so without taking into
account Professor Mayer's storehouse of
facts and without facing up to his highly
skilful analysis. Perhaps what is wrong
with the book is its title which suggests
a much broader study than he has
provided.

Mandate for Change: The White
House Years, 1953-1956. Dwight D.
Eisenhower. Heinemann. 71s. 3d.
C|bviously it was the accident of
George Washington which bent so
unmilitaristic a people as the Americans
into the habit of looking so often to
military leaders for potential presidents.
Given this tradition, it might still seem
a little surprising that among the military
leaders of the Second World War it
was on Eisenhower, rather than on the
more obviously proconsular Macarthur,
or the more stately and distinguished
Marshall that the political choice fell.
But Eisenhower himself understood why:
Emmet Hughes has a story of the Presi-
dent's weeding out some of the plentiful
corn from a speech written for him, and
grumbling—“ Hell, I wish they wouldn't
give me all these folksy expressions—
I’m folksy as all-get-out anway.”
And so he was: it was the combina-
tion of that personal quality with his
association with a victorious and spec-
tacular military campaign that made him
an irresistible political candidate, one
that the Democrats also would have been
glad to capture for their own party
nomination, had he been inclined in their
direction. Eisenhower tells in this
volume the story of Truman offering
him the Democratic nomination for 1948
if he should want it. Yet this appeal
to both parties did not in fact mean,
as it was sometimes thought to do, that
Eisenhower was a non-partisan person,
in some way above party politics. He
was authentically a Republican, and a
Conservative Republican at that. The
true line of division in American poli-
tics, often hard for non-Americans to
discern, is between the proponents of
“small government” (of whom Barry
Goldwater is the most extreme current
example) and the proponents of “large
government”. (The division is admit-
tedly blurred by the fact that Southern
Conservatives vote Democratic, but that
is an historical accident, possibly now on
its way to being remedied.) On this
criterion Eisenhower, who speculated
wistfully about selling the TVA, and who
had an anxiously frugal way with a
budget, and an obsessive deference to the
Senate, belongs to the Goldwater side of
the argument. Lyndon Johnson, on the
other hand, though strikingly like Eisen-
hower in his personal political appeal
and “folksiness”, belongs on the other
side along with FDR and John
Kennedy and Harry Truman.
What differentiated Eisenhower from
someone like Taft, to whom he was
quite close as far as convictions about
domestic affairs went, was simply that
the years he had spent in the line of
duty in Europe, first with the Allied
armies in the Second World War and
later with NATO (doing the behests of
Democratic presidents) had given him an
orientation towards the European alli-
ance for America, and an experience in
working with European leaders, which
no other potential Republican nominee
possessed. Elis great historical function
was to reconcile the Republican Party
to America’s contemporary role in the
world balance of power. It was an
achievement that his rival for the nomi-
nation, Taft, could not or would not
have matched, and which is not likely to
be undermined even if Barry Goldwater
is nominated and (by some unimaginable
mischance) elected this year.
But there is not much that could be
regarded as reflection on his own or his
party’s historical role in this volume of
Eisenhower's memoirs. There are no
surprises: the President emerges from
his own book, as he has from the


accounts given by others, as a worthy,
conventional, slightly irascible man, with
a profound sense of duty, who leaned
rather heavily on his more strong-
minded policy-makers, such as the
brothers Dulles, and mostly took the
advice of the party professionals on the
machinery side of politics. His prose-
style might charitably be called regi-
mental: when he wants to convey that he
saw a lot of Mr Churchill, who was
nearby, he writes “geographical proximity
permitted us frequent opportunities for
personal contact”, and when he meant
“Yes” he said “My answer will be posi-
tive, that is affirmative”. The contrast
between the pedestrian jog-trot of Eisen-
hower's own narrative, and the sudden
flights of quasi-Biblical poetic oratory
when he is interpolating the speeches
that Emmet Hughes wrote for him is
sometimes rather quaint. If that well-
nourished literary ghost had not supplied
his own account one might have tended
to diagnose a case of stylistic schizo-
phrenia.
TI/’hat are the reasons for reading this
sort of book? Not, in this case, the
hope of major revelations: there are
none. Not for new light on the men
who worked with or for or against
Eisenhower: though he hardly says an
unkind word, he equally hardly says a
revealing one. Nor for an interpretation
of the time he took decisions for: if the
President had any coherent vision of the
patch of history that may be called by
his name, he hardly conveys it here. But
he does supply some details of particu-
lar episodes not previously authenticated,
and his eye for some kinds of situation
remains sharp: he demonstrates suc-
cinctly, for instance, the degree to which
Dien Bien Phu was a military as against
a political folly. There is' a nice irony,
in view of the past ten years of Ameri-
can effort in Vietnam, in his quotation
of Bedell Smith as telling Bidault that
“any second-rate general should be able
to win in Indo-China if there were a
proper political atmosphere”. Curiously
enough, one of the main effects of read-
ing these memoirs is a deepened regret
that Winston Churchill will never write
a memoir of his last years of power,
roughly in the period covered by this
volume, 1953-55. (The crises of 1956
are left for the next volume.) Even fil-
tered through Eisenhower’s account one
gets a considerable impression of the
continuing intellectual fertility of the
great old man in London, nearing the
end of his effective political life but still
determined to push diplomatic events
into a new pattern—a pattern that has
in fact somehow emerged in the Ken-
nedy- Johnson period.

Reign of Terror
A Mirror of Nazism: British Opinion
and the Emergence of Hitler 1929-
1933. Brigitte Granzow. Gollancz.
425. 3d.
HThe trouble with liberalism, Nietzsche
A once remarked, is that it is forever
being surprised by the world. If “liberal-
ism” is taken to mean that system of
beliefs characterised by an optimistic
faith in progress, a belief in the perfecti-
bility of rationality of men, and a stress
on the letter and form of constitutions —
and this is what it has usually meant in
this century —then this is penetratingly
true. Nothing bears it out more clearly
than the response of liberalism (or at
least “liberalism”) to the two great
totalitarian movements of modern time.
This book is concerned with the re-
actions of the “quality” British Press to
Nazism in the crucial period when Hitler
emerged from obscurity to seize power
in Germany, and with the way in which
their description of it measures up to
what we have since come to know about
the movement. Despite its use of hind-
sight it plays fair and never forgets the
limitations under which the journalists
had to make their judgments. Dr Gran-
zow's attention is always on what they
were able to make of the facts as they
knew them.
The picture that emerges is in some
ways very much to the credit of the
newspapers. They were, at least after
the Nazi success in the elections of Sep-
tember, 1930, impressively well informed
about the facts concerning the move-
ment, and some of the correspondents
and leader-writers had quite penetrating
insights into some of its aspects. The
“Manchester Guardian”, for instance,
saw through Hitler's “legalism” as early
as December, 1930:
“. . . the Nazis are making a bid
for power, not by open insurrection
(which is the Communist way and
doomed to fail), but by entering the
Government . . . The tactics of the
Nazis are something like Communist
cell tactics, only conceived with far
greater imagination and realism.”
At various times the ideological im-
portance of anti-Semitism, the success of
the Nazis in mobilising the unpolitical,
the crucial role of terror, the function
of front organisations were all recog-
nised as key features of the movement
by one newspaper or another.
And yet the story is one of failure-
failure to draw significant conclusions
from the information which they them-
selves provided or to connect the partial
insights they had into a coherent picture.
Failure even to cling to the truths they
had discovered. Throughout this period
the best English newspapers and journals
continued to believe that the Nazis would
probably behave like ordinary politicians
once in office, that they were not un-
like the Nationalists and Conservatives
(‘The Times”, in January, 1932, thought
it fair to describe Bruning as “the first
practical National Socialist”), that the
terrorism of the SA occurred because
the Nazi leaders were unable to control
the rank and file. With few exceptions
they equated the anti-Semitism of the
Nazis with traditional anti-Jewish feeling
in Germany. The most important failure
of all was the inability to recognise the
significance of the Fuhrerprinzip and the
importance of Hitler. He was depicted
variously as the moderate of the Nazi
movement, as a reactionary rather than
a revolutionary, as a colorless medioc-
rity, as incapable of controlling his own
movement and as the front man of other
and abler politicians. As late as Octo-
ber, 1932, “The Times” thought that a
way should be found to ensure that Hit-
ler should be the next President of the
Weimar Republic—because of his
moderate outlook and trustworthiness!
Why, when the factual reporting was
so good, were the interpretations placed
on the facts generally so disastrously
wrong? On the evidence of this book,
largely because of the indestructible
optimism of the liberal intellectuals who
filled the pages of the quality press. If
they were being continually surprised by
the world, they showed a remarkable
power of recovery and of adapting them-
selves to that which had surprised them.
With hope springing eternal in their
breasts, they quickly overlooked their
own insights and in a spirit of “forgive
and forget” proceeded to place the most
optimistic construction on what was
happening in the Nazi movement.
HThus the Nazis had only to drop anti-
A Semitism from their speeches for a
few days for the “Manchester Guardian”
to conclude that “the more pronounced
anti-Semitism . . . had ebbed away from
the German movement” —though only a
month before the same paper had carried
a report of a pogrom-like action by the
Nazis in the Kurfurstendamn in Berlin
and had described it as “the worst anti-
Semitic excesses there have yet been in
Germany”. Hitler could publicly en-
courage murder and violence and then
easily recover his reputation for modera-
tion and legalism with a few “respon-
sible” speeches just as, twenty-five
years later, Khrushchev, the man who
ordered the Red Army into Hungary
and allowed the hounding of Pasternak,
was quietly able to establish himself as
a “reasonable” Communist. The saying
that in politics too much memory is a
dangerous thing is true; but no memory
at all is disastrous.
The other main obstacle to under-
standing the nature of Nazism was the
conviction that what was true of English


politics was true of all politics. In
reality, far from representing normality
English politics are virtually unique and
any attempt to generalise from them is
certain to lead one astray. The English
newspapers tended to assume that the
Nazi ideology and programme need not
be taken seriously because of their irra-
tionality and inconsistencies, whereas
these were really the source of their
strength and appeal. In general they
were impressed by Hitler's legal tactics
and even argued his democratic right to
be included in coalitions. They were
impressed by the fact that six million
Germans voted for the Nazis and took
it as evidence of the movement’s respec-
tability. The much admired British
empiricism and pragmatism, which work
quite well in examining English parties
and politics, made it particularly difficult
for them to grasp the principles by
which Nazism operated or the impor-
tance of ideology. Instead they concen-
trated on and were fascinated by what
the Nazis did from day to day. It is
not surprising that they ended up giving
an impressive account of the trees but
a very misleading description of the
woods.
This book has its faults —it tends to
be repetitive, it fails to distinguish
clearly enough between reporting and
editorial comment, and it often does not
indicate whether it is quoting from major
articles or from minor items —but what
it has to say is important for anyone
who wishes to understand either totali-
tarianism or the way Western liberal in-
tellectuals think about politics. For, as
the response to Communism in the last
two decades has shown, the lessons im-
plicit in this first contact with totalitarian
politics have still to be learnt.
OWEN HARRIES
Two Rebels
All Men Are Islands. Ronald Duncan.
Rupert Hart-Davis. 525.
Sweetly Sings the Donkey. Shelagh
Delaney. Methuen. 20s.
Pound once called Ronald Dun-
can “the lone wolf of English let-
ters”. Lone, yes, but otherwise not a
particularly lupine wolf. Indeed, reading
some of his poems and verse dramas,
one gets the impression that he would
have been spiritually much more com-
fortable in the age of the Yellow Book.
Beardsley might almost have decorated
“The Death of Satan” and “This Way
to the Tomb”. Duncan’s libretto for
Britten’s opera “The Rape' of Lucretia”
is likely to survive most of his other
literary works, simply because of its
adventitious association with the music
of the only operatic composer of inter-
national stature that England has ever
produced.
Duncan's share, and it was a very sub-
stantial one, in the founding of the
English Stage Company is his chief
claim to the gratitude and respect of his
contemporaries and probably of posterity
too. All the new British dramatists—
Osborne, Pinter, Wesker, Delaney,
Arden and Simpson—have had plays
produced at the Royal Court, and the
theatre has also seen the first produc-
tions in England of works by Beckett,
lonesco, Sartre and Genet. One has
only to compare London’s theatrical fare
of the mid-1960s with that of the early
postwar years to realise what a revolution
has been accomplished.
The first volume of Duncan’s auto-
biography ends before these palmy days.
However, the book is a most interesting
chronicle of an exceedingly odd charac-
ter in search of a philosophy and a
vocation. There are fascinating glimpses
of cranky Ezra Pound, Old Possum
Eliot, young Benjamin Britten, puritanic
and vitriolic F. R. Leavis (under whom
Duncan studied at Cambridge) and
other literary bigwigs into whose orbits
Duncan casually floated at one time or
another. Duncan himself always re-
mained a peripheral figure, attached to
no school and owning no master. In
between writing poems and verse dramas
he worked as a coal miner, held some
equivocal sort of job in the city and
lived for a while in Gandhi's village
settlement in India. At the outbreak
of World War II he was farming a few
acres of bog and bramble in north
Devon, impeded by a handful of anar-
chical assistants whom he tried unsuc-
cessfully to weld into a primitive share-
the-wealth community. His second vol-
ume should be even more rewarding
reading.
Duncan’s father was an illegitimate
son of the Crown Prince of Bavaria. One
of his aunts was the mistress of an
Indian potentate. His great-aunt had
a Park Lane mansion and 10 servants.
His family circumstances were as exotic
as those of Shelagh Delaney were dourly
provincial. Miss Delaney came straight
out of the milieu of “Z-Cars” and
“Coronation Street”; she was, and still is,
an intellectual tearaway. She was only
19 when Joan Littlewood’s East End
Theatre Workshop produced “A Taste
of Honey” in 1958. Two years later
“The Lion in Love” was staged at the
little Belgrade Theatre in Coventry be-
fore moving to London. The two plays
established Shelagh Delaney’s reputation
before she was old enough to vote.
“Sweetly Sings the Donkey” is a col-
lection of short pieces strung together on
a rather tenuous autobiographical thread.
They are lusty and often vividly evoca-
tive pictures of the author’s childhood,
her reaction to the success of her first
play, her visit to Poland and her im-
pressions of a fantastic guided tour of
a North Country industrial city. The
gem of the book is a perfect and fiercely
tender conte about a boy with a
crippled heart who danced to death
learning the Spanish flamenco. In it
Shelagh Delaney’s exuberantly earthy
style is completely under control.
GEOFFREY SCOTT
Censor’s Lapse
Split Scene. Frederic Mull ally. Arthur
Barker. 225. 6.
'W/’hy some books get banned and
"" others with an equal “tendency to
corrupt” circulate unmolested has always
been a puzzle. Why, amongst the cur-
rent crop of novels, “The Group” should
be pounced upon and “Split Scene”
remain at large will more than puzzle
those who happen to read both. A
function which surely should be the
careful concern of a qualified national
body, and that only, still appears to be
largely a matter of chance.
Frederic Mullally, a former political
journalist, has evidently realised that sex
sells better than politics. Two earlier
novels—“Danse Macabre” and “Man
with Tin Trumpet”—were criticised (and
purchased) for his treatment of his new
subject, but he has pulled no punches
with this third novel.
His hero, John Norman, is also a poli-
tical journalist, which gives the author
an excellent excuse to air his views on the
Common Market, “constructive co-exist-
ence with the Soviet Union”, and
(scathingly) the American way of life.
Ruth Brent, supposedly a typical product
of American “feminism”, wishes to rent
a flat that Norman is temporarily vaca-
ting. Because of repeated postpone-
ments of his trip—-you guessed it—they
eventually arrange to share the flat, first
drawing up rules which are supposed to
ensure individual privacy.
Norman is proudly English and self-
consciously masculine, and has a parti-
cular prejudice against American women
who, in his opinion, have not only “swop-
ped the mysteries and allure of true
femininity for an equal stake in a man’s
world”, but are sexually frigid and “have
united in a monstrous conspiracy to cas-
trate their menfolk”. One wonders why
he is so concerned about the fate of the
American husband. That the poison
“might well spread until it challenged
even the Englishman’s unique role in a
heterosexual society” seems a rather
tenuous excuse for writing a novel.
Once this is swallowed, however, the
reader can relax and enjoy it —if his
stomach is strong.
The sexual histories of Ruth and John
are well and truly documented and cul-
minate in the expected sado-masochistic
clash between dominating English man-
hood. If one overlooks the lapses into
journalese, this is a sophisticated and
fast-moving novel.
TOM PIKERING


BUSINESS AND FINANCE
Wages Up; Now What?
As generally expected, Australian wage earners working
under Federal Awards will receive, as from June 19, an
increase of £1 a week for males and 15s. for females.
Before crying catastrophe, it should be kept in mind that this
is a three-year adjustment, as the last increase was in July,
1961.
The four judges on the bench had a split decision, two at
10s. and two at 205., but obviously they decided the economy
could afford an increased Federal wage, even though sounding
warnings on the possibility of changed conditions such as a
setback to exports.
Prosperity of the rural industries was an important factor
in assessing the nation’s capacity to pay, and it is interesting
to speculate on the outcome if those special windfall sales of
wheat, sugar, etc., had not occurred.
As a trading nation, Australia now must face up to an in-
creased cost in locally manufactured goods, including the effect
of the latest judgment in touching off further wage demands.
The thing to consider, however, is that most workers are re-
ceiving a margin above the basic wage, and as the Common-
wealth Arbitration Commission had rejected the employers’
application for a “total” or single-element wage and also the
trade unions’ claim for restoration of automatic quarterly ad-
justments, there must be greater scope for individual negotia-
tions between employers and unions. This, in fact, is what has
happened in many cases and there are some who believe it is
economically wise to move even closer to the US system of
separate wage bargaining for each industry. Thoughtless wage
demands can bring their own problems, as witness recent re-
ports from France and Italy.
Common Market Battles
Against Inflation
Common Market countries are being urged to take their
inflationary problems very seriously indeed. Earlier this
year the Commission had suggested unified policies to combat
inflation, and now its annual report speaks of the “peril” con-
fronting members unless they spring to action.
The situation is far from new. A great deal of attention
was paid to it last year, with the Commission pressing for
treatment on an all-European level. Such an ideal looks hard
to establish, especially as the conditions in individual countries
vary so greatly.
Germany, by wise Government action to hold the great
inflow of foreign funds at bay, seems to be faring well in spite
of the stimulus exerted by exports on domestic expansiveness.
France, Italy and Holland, however, are finding it much harder
to bring anti-inflationary guns into action.
Much of the Common Market's predicament arises from
its.almost self-induced proneness to inflation as one result of
the Six’s considerably higher rate of investment since 1958.
The increasing momentum of world trade and the current
labor shortage provide other pressures.
Factors like these have, between 1958 and 1963, seen the
cost of living advance by 5 p.c. in Belgium, 12 p.c. in Ger-
many, 13 p.c. in Holland, 15 p.c. in Italy and 23 p.c. in
France. The Commission does not wish to slow Europe’s
economic expansion, yet is obviously nervous about the con-
tinuing rise in prices.
It even presses consideration of a common incomes policy,
which seems difficult enough to achieve on a national basis,
let alone by the Six in concert. Meanwhile France and Italy
pin their faith on internal stabilisation plans to control prices.
Both are plagued with balance-of-payments problems as well.
Instructing the Public
On Investment
"Popularity of the lecture .series on the principles of invest-
ment has prompted the Sydney Stock Exchange to appoint
Mr F. B. Mitchell as a full-time education officer.
The Adult Education Service, sponsored as an experiment
by the Stock Exchange in 1960 at five Department of Educa-
tion evening colleges in the Sydney metropolitan area, has
snowballed. The number of persons taking the course has
grown from 75 in 1960 to 900 in the first term of 1964, plus
a further 350 at courses for city office workers held at the
Sydney Stock Exchange.
To cater for areas outside the city, classes have been
arranged at Wollongong, Gosford, Bathurst and Wagga, NSW.
The courses on the principles of investment do not guaran-
tee that the student will make a fortune. Similarly, the 80
students (drawn from the securities industry) who currently
are taking the diploma course at the Sydney Technical College
are not given any special insight into what makes the market
go up and down.
History shows that the weight of expert opinion is not
always right and, if it is, the question arises of ‘'How long
will the rise or fall continue?”
Nevertheless, a working knowledge of investment techniques
helps to encourage the desire to save and accumulate; and
though there be losses along the difficult road of investment,
it is obvious that the long-term investor in solid securities is
protecting his liquid assets against an inevitable depreciation
in money value.
Patience is needed, as investment is unlike horse-racing.
Unfortunately, there is a tendency for the small investor to
believe (and sometimes be told) that his small initial outlay
is besf invested, in “cheap” shares to suit his pocket. Much
better advice, for security, is to put the money on fixed deposit
or in bonds until sufficient is saved to buy a parcel of “dear”
shares, which may prove cheapest in the long run.
Usually, the minimum marketable parcel of shares is 100.
But if the shares are priced above 50s. the minimum parcel is
50, while it is necessary to buy only 25 shares as a parcel if
the shares sell between £5 and £lO. The brokerage also is
cheaper at these higher levels (only 1J p.c. for 80s. and over).
The paper work for shareholders is just the same if pro-
cessing a transfer form for 100 small shares or 50 big shares


and much more expensive if processing four single 100 s of
cheap shares. This explains why brokerage is relatively higher
on cheap shares (e.g., 21d. on 55.).
Sometimes the sharebroker must spend just as much time
with a client who has £IOO to invest as a client with £IO,OOO.
Perhaps he may feel exasperated when patiently outlining de-
tails to the small investor. But the small investor, particularly
the younger one, may someday be in charge of extensive assets
■ —either his own or a company’s—so the education programme
eventually should pay dividends, nationally and brokerage-
wise.
Struggle for Local Equity
In Aluminium
Come of the reasons why Australian bauxite attracts the big
overseas aluminium companies were stated very clearly by
the executive vice-president of the Aluminium Company of
America, Mr John M. Mitchell, when speaking at Perth in
February.
“Australia’s vast supply of bauxite is particularly significant
in the world aluminium industry because of the stability of
the Australian political and economic system, the country’s
favorable attitude toward foreign investment of a constructive
nature and the helpful co-operation offered a company in be-
coming established,” Mr Mitchell explained.
All these elements assuredly appealed to the international
concerns bidding for the Gove (Northern Territory) outer de-
posits—Aluminium A. G., Switzerland; the Reynolds group,
USA; American Metals Climax; and Pechiney, France. Most
significantly, however, they were joined by two local compan-
ies: United Uranium, in association with the Canadian Con-
solidated Mining and Smelting Co., and Kathleen Investments.
Rejecting every tender in its present form, the Federal Gov-
ernment made it plain that provision for a sizeable Australian
equity in any development at Gove, from mining to smelting,
was a fundamental consideration. A fresh series of applica-
tions can be submitted by December 1 next.
The intervening period looks like seeing a measure of public
sympathy build up for United Uranium in its attempt to fortify
a dominant Australian participation at Gove. Most import-
antly, United’s chairman, Mr K. W. Craig, has mentioned an
approach to the institutions and large local companies such
as CSR and BHP if there were
indications that the bid could
be successful.
Strength of this kind must
obviously be drawn in if the
great overseas combines are to
be successfully opposed. It
could be the more needed when
an Australian company has to
meet international pricing con-
ditions on the export market.
The accompanying graph
shows how, in the Western
World, demand is lately press-
ing closer to available capacity.
Nevertheless, surplus capacity
remains a decided influence on
overall trade. Optimism and
massive financial power are
called for in adding to world
capacity, as Gove ultimately
will.
Existing producers sound
confident enough about the pos-
sibilities of the purely Austral-
ian market, where per capita
consumption is expected to
Western World’s Aluminium Output
The Western World’s capacity for manufacturing primary
aluminium is significantly above consumption, as the above
graph shows. However, 1963 saw a distinct improvement in
demand, which touched 92 per cent of average capacity
compared with 87 per cent in 1962 and 80 per cent in 1961.
reach 12.25 lb. in 1964. Everything points to further growth
if the corresponding figures for other industrial nations furnish
a guide: USA, 32.3 lb.; Switzerland, 20; Sweden, 19; Western
Germany, 17; and UK, 17.
Australia’s production capacity for aluminium will soon
reach 92,000 tons a year, though actual output for 1963 was
only 41,263 tons. The Government’s designs for Gove have
to be seen in the light of present smelting ability and also of
the Gladstone (Queensland) alumina plant which should be
commissioned by 1967.
Japanese Economy, Too,
Faces Inflation
"Inflationary tendencies are becoming a worrying bugbear
A for several industrial economies throughout the world, as
other articles in this section testify. It hardly sounds surpris-
ing, therefore, when a further recital of the classic symptoms
also arrives from Japan.
Some Japanese financial commentators were giving close
concern to the situation right at the time the Australia-Japan
Trade Treaty received its formal ratification by the contracting
parties.
They appear nervous that the tight-money policy, aimed
primarily at a critical balance-of-payments position, is not yet
exerting any very decisive effect internally. Admittedly the
monetary technique may prove gradually all-pervasive.
At present, though, bank lendings remain uncomfortably
high, according to a few critics. But the nub of inflation stems
from rising consumer prices and positive advances in wages,
production and demand.
Consumer prices have gone ahead 7 p.c. in each of the last
three years, while wages show a 10 p.c. annual increase.
The monetary weapon and attempts at price controls are not
made any the more efficacious by realising that much of the
inflationary drive is created by the very vigorous effort to
double Japanese income during the current decade.
Uneasy Coalition Politics
In Italy
T>rospect of even stiffer economic restrictions in Italy is
A putting pressure on the political parties which comprise
the Centre-Left Coalition Government. Never the best of
buddy-buddies at any time, the
Socialists under Signor Moro
and the Christian Democrats
under Signor Colombo are being
needled from outside by EEC,
the Bank of Italy and other in-
fluential sources to restrict Gov-
ernment spending and to freeze
wages.
The Socialists are in a difficult
position because the Communist
trade unions have rejected sug-
gestions for a pay pause. The
Socialists, anxious to avoid loss
of power in the labor unions,
cannot ignore the fact that labor
costs have jumped 27 p.c. in
1963, but if they get too tough
with the unions they fear the
Communists may regain control.
The coalition Government is
pledged to long-term reforms
in Italy, but the cost of these
reforms now becomes a major
issue when other sections of the
economy are being asked to suf-
fer restraints.


ECONOMICS ANONYMOUS
The Prospect for Productivity
Extension of efficiency methods
HThe Australian economy has been en-
joying many blessings in the last year
or so and it is only natural for experi-
enced economists as well as sceptics to
say they cannot last indefinitely. The
list is long: Record export earnings, price
stability, rising incomes, full employ-
ment and, now, clear evidence that pro-
ductivity is beating the average by a
considerable margin.
Allowing for a 4 p.c. increase in the
employed work force and a 1 i points or
1.2 p.c. increase to 126 in the consumer
price index and the nine months’ figure
for GNP this year, which is up from
£6045m. to £6583m. (or 8.9 p.c.), pro-
ductivity has risen from 31 to 4 p.c. so
far this year against an average rise of
from li to 2 p.c. in recent years.
The question, then, is whether this
exceptionally high rate of increase in
productivity is likely to be sustained in
face of acute labor shortages on the one
hand and the narrowing range of unused
industrial capacity to be taken into em-
ployment on the other.
For. skipping the details of its uneven
distribution between industries, this
striking rise in productivity seems to de-
rive more from the fuller use of existing
industrial capacity than to any other
single factor. Compared with 1962-63,
those industries in which productivity
appears to have made the greatest re-
sponse from the greater use of existing
plant and equipment are textiles, chemi-
cals (including petrochemicals), paper,
construction materials and automotive,
including components and accessories.
In some of these, notably in the auto-
motive, chemical and construction
materials industries, there have also been
heavy additions to capacity and these
are bound to have assisted productivity.
llTith labor shortages militating against
” the full use of industrial capacity and
in any case a reduced volume of un-
used capacity to be taken up. the most
hopeful feature of the productivity pic-
ture seems to be the current rising rate
of investment in new plant and equip-
ment. Some industries, such as durable
consumer goods, where in the highly
competitive condition of the trade both
production and new investment are
patchy and unused capacity still wide-
spread, are a blot on the scene. None-
theless, generally speaking, it seems that
the combined volume of new and old
capacity being brought into use is rising
more rapidly than the employed labor
force.
On the face of it, a continuation of
this situation would be favorable for
sustaining the rate of increase in pro-
ductivity, which in the broadest sense
can be defined as production per worker
employed. This was one of the themes
of the Institute of Public Affairs’ bro-
chure on productivity last year. The
IPA pointed out that the American
worker had roughly twice the amount
of machine power at his elbow as the
Australian worker, and that “this was
one of the main reasons for the very
high output per man in American in-
dustry”. Largely because of this, pro-
duction per worker employed is in Aus-
tralia only 55 p.c. of that of America’s.
•T'he prospect for productivity here,
however, is less satisfactory than
might appear. This is simply because the
employed labor force is not rising
rapidly enough. Beset as we are by
labor shortages, particularly of skilled
labor, which counts most in productivity,
in the period ahead there is little doubt
that these will prevent industry from
taking full advantage of its additions to
capacity. This is not to say that pro-
ductivity will not go on advancing, but
rather that the rate of increase will slow
down. Only if labor supplies could be
expanded at a higher rate could we
expect recent rates of productivity
increase to be sustained.
Even with the accelerated immigra-
tion of skilled workers and more inten-
sive industrial training of teenagers, in-
creasing numbers of trained workers
entering the labor force will only pro-
vide a limited solution to the produc-
tivity problem. As matters stand, it
seems highly unlikely that additions to
the supply of trained workers will be
geared to the advancing level of invest-
ment in plant and equipment. We will
fall somewhere short of a full solution
along the numbers route.
This makes it all the more imperative
that, to maintain recent rates of produc-
tivity increases, we must look to impro-
ving the efficiency of labor, both on the
factory floor and in the flights of man-
agement. This is, of course, a continu-
ing task for industry, but it is probably
now more conscious of it than ever, both
in its consideration of incentives to
workers and its attention to what, in
evidence he gave before the Tariff Board
the other day, Mr Walter Scott referred
to generally as industrial efficiency.
In the past the unions have been very
wary of incentives related to production
performance, and employers will find it
tough going to progress along such lines.
The incentives pattern here is rather one
of fringe benefits, but the unions see
these more as legitimate handouts by
firms to attract and hold labor, even
if many have a high welfare content as
well. Their range is very extensive, as
recently shown by a Victorian Employ-
ers' Federation survey of fringe benefits
given by 35 firms. Between them these
firms had as many as 28 different varie-
ties of fringe benefits in operation. These
varied from haircuts in company’s time
to discounts on goods. About 90 p.c.
of the firms gave these.
(Apparently some overseas firms out-
do the fringe benefits of Victorian firms.
Examples quoted at an industrial officers’
convention recently ranged from an
181 b Christmas turkey for each em-
ployee to honeymoon-leave on full pay.)
But the unions may be coming round
to the acceptance of performance
bonuses. Following the recent intro-
duction of productivity performance
allowances at the Small Arms Factory
at Lithgow (NSW), union officials in
Victoria are at least looking at a similar
proposal suggested by the Department
of Supply for the 4000 employees of the
Government's aircraft, explosives and
munitions factories in the State. Accep-
tance has not yet been decided, but a
similar scheme has been approved by the
Federal Council of the Federated Iron-
workers’ Association.
basis for calculating bonus pay-
ments under the scheme is the aver-
age performance of a group of workers
over a four-week period. The group be-
comes eligible for the bonus when a
sufficient number of its workers are
operating under standards set by
method-engineering techniques. The
amount of the bonus then depends on
the production achieved by the group.
This idea could catch on more widely.
In the meantime, the main onus for in-
creasing efficiency per worker would
seem to rest on the extension of effici-
ency methods outlined by Mr Scott to
the Tariff Board. Some general criteria
which he believed contributed impor-
tantly to an overall assessment of com-
pany efficiency were keeping up-to-date
in plant and equipment, to extend the
practical application of industrial en-
gineering techniques and the use of
managerial cost information, attention
to training and personal relationships
and the improvement of the “intangible
but vitally significant factor of mana-
gerial ability”.


“CROESUS"
As You Were in Wages
Why the total wage concept was rejected
PFhe total wage concept was evidently
far too big for the Arbitration Com-
mission to swallow whole. The Commis-
sion obviously likes the piecemeal ap-
proach as much as the trade unions, so
we are back where we were on the wages
front that is, with a good, round, old-
fashioned rise of £1 a week to keep
matters tidy till the next time.
As a matter of fact, we must agree
wholeheartedly with the Commission that
in the present circumstances it was pre-
mature for the employers to put forward
their total wage proposals at all.
For however attractive the idea may
be both in logic and on economic
grounds, the Commission’s writ doesn’t
run nearly wide enough to implement it,
for without a national income policy
covering the whole field of incomes, it
would be meaningless in social terms.
What in fact were the employers asking
the Commission to swallow? The public
has been rather confused about this, so
it is worth reiterating the excellent sum-
mary of it in Mr Justice Gallagher’s
separate judgment (which, like the
others, refused the application):
“Oroaolv stated, the case presented by
the employers was that the basic
wage has become an anachronism, that it
no longer serves any useful purpose, that,
in fact, it is an impediment to proper
wage fixation, that it is a cause of indus-
trial unrest, that it should give way to
modern methods of fixation and that the
time has arrived for its abolition,” his
Honor said.
“Stated in greater detail, it was sub-
mitted that there is no adult employee
on the basic wage; that the correct sys-
tem of wage fixation is one which en-
sures that wage increases are kept within
productivity growth; that in this way
wage increases can be granted without
impairing stability; that the proper imple-
mentation of such a system is conditional
upon the establishment of a total wage
as distinct from a basic wage and margin;
that current principles applied by the
Commission result in the basic wage and
margins being decided on the same
economic considerations; that this being
the position there is no logical ground
for two separate fixations; that it is
economically unsound to have produc-
tivity reflected in both segments; that
once the Commission alters the basic
wage it creates an immediate claim for
adjustments of marginal relativity; that
the attitude of unions in persistently
seeking restoration of marginal relativity
has been for years the cause of indus-
trial unrest; and that with the creation
of a total wage this cause of unrest
would be removed.”
It will be obvious from the unanimous
decision in the basic wage case itself to
refuse the union’s claim for the restora-
tion of automatic quarterly cost-of-living
adjustments, that a similar red herring
thrown in the path of the total wage by
the unions received equally short shrift
from the Commission. Like the em-
ployers, the Commission rather concen-
trated its main attention on automatic
productivity adjustments within specified
ranges based on average productivity
growth.
True, the Commission advanced other
arguments against automatic productivity
adjustments: the difficulty of measuring
productivity, for instance. It also talked
about the absence of an overall national
incomes policy and control over prices—
“We are not prepared to assume that
prices will necessarily move in conso-
nance with any economic theory or
formula.”
Again, there was the awful question
of over-award payments, the so-called
wages drift—“ This drift operates inde-
pendently of the Commission, although
we realise it may well be affected by
decisions of the Commission”.
Apart from all this the Commission
expressed fears that adoption of auto-
matic productivity adjustments would
militate against its own flexibility in
dealing with a particular situation which
might be referred to it for increasing
wages beyond the limits dictated by any
predetermined formula. And, more per-
tinently perhaps, it thought the adjust-
ments would probably tend to detract
from the valuable work at present being
done by individual members of the Com-
mission in determining work values for
the purpose of fixing margins in particu-
lar industries. These last two objections
may well be valid, but they would hardly
be decisive.
With all this ammunition being aimed
at their counsel, one would not wish to
pour more fuel on the employers' fire.
But Mr James Robinson would conceiv-
ably have done better had he hammered
away at the obvious case for determining
margins and basic wages at simul-
taneous hearings, even to the neglect of
his other interesting but sometimes
tedious and lengthy excursions. The
unions couldn't be expected to agree with
the proposition, but at least the Com-
mission might have seen merit in it
stated as a single proposition, as a first
step to the main goal.
As it was, this limited reform was lost
in the wilderness of the general submis-
sion with all its by-ways. In the end it
could be that the Commission was left
as confused as reporters as to what he
really wanted most.
This was a pity because at one stage
Mr R. W. Hawke seemed to think it
would be all right to have a total wage,
providing regular cost-of-living adjust-
ments were thrown in with the total
wage.
Oeading between the lines of the
* various judgments, the impression is
given that because the Commission ob-
viously regards the basic wage itself as
sacrosanct, the employers might have
had a better chance of getting simul-
taneous hearings on margins and basic
wages if they had put their case at a
margins hearing rather than at a basic
wage hearing.
In any case, it is enlightening to know
that although the Commission is often
charged with duplicating its distributions
of productivity in margins and basic
wage judgments, it stoutly denies that
it does. But even this doesn’t get away
from the fact that, whether there is dup-
lication or not, over-award payments
distribute productivity on their own
account.
It may be, of course, that the Com-
mission is only waiting for the politicians
to rub the “basic wage” phrase from
the Act (and possibly to do much else
to it besides), for the same three Com-
missioners say: “It may be that if one
were now to start afresh and were
charged with bringing into operation a
national wage code, one would not worry
about creating a basic wage or anything
like it!”
The Commission certainly found itself
in the strait-jacket of the Act when
considering the total wage application.
Even though it held that the total wage
case “should be decided on its intrinsic
merits at this point of time, and if this
claim were to succeed before this Full
Bench we feel that, as he has been shown
by the history of basic wage fixations,
ways and means could be found to
give general effect to the employers’
case.”
It spells out in several places in the
judgments that this would be virtually
impossible.

MARKET POINTERS
Inflation or Reduced Profits?
HPhe Federal basic wage increase, al-
though anticipated, has touched off
the usual prognostications about inflation
and the suggestion that the next Com-
monwealth Budget may need to consider
tax increases to curb spending power.
It was always thus. But it is confus-
ing to the investor to be told on one
hand that it might be wise to invest in
equity shares (to counter inflationary
effects) while also being told that the
Government may impose heavier taxes
to drain off surplus spending power.
The company which carries the in-
vestor’s money also needs to earn higher
profits to counter the inflationary trend.
But if higher wages, heavier costs and
extra taxes are squeezing the profits,
the company could be in for a leaner
time.
AAA
"Importers of completely knocked down
vehicles may have their problems,
with pressure to increase the volume of
local components.
To cut costs, some of the assemblers
may band together. It could also put
extra business in the way of contract
assemblers like Pressed Metal Corpora-
tion Ltd, a subsidiary of Larke Consoli-
dated Industries Ltd.
A A A
T. A. Gilbert, Sydney Metropolitan
** car dealer, is a solid profit-earner
and its latest result could encourage in-
vestment, despite the arguments about a
possible increase in sales tax.
If sales tax does go up, this is one
company which looks as if it should cope
with any threat to sales.
AAA
Tf the Treasury wants to curb John
A Citizen’s spending, the booming motor
industry is one obvious sector which the
tax gatherer would inspect when con-
sidering additional sales tax.
Not everyone feels this is justified,
especially when the Commonwealth
Government is seeking to encourage 95
p.c. local manufacturing content in Aus-
tralian vehicles. It might seem like a
backhand blow to the locals.
But the motor vehicle industry has
been hit before and the current 22! p.c.
sales tax is low when compared with the
punishing 40 p.c. of November, 1960.
AAA
#"izAPAPER Ltd, in the medium term,
could justify its current 17s. 9d.
market price, which yields only 3.5 p.c.
Recently, this Melbourne-based manu-
facturer of sensitised paper announced
that pre-tax profits in the December half
were £43,000 —in the full 1963 year
they were £75,000. Last month the
shareholders collected a steady interim
of 5 p.c. on capital increased by a one-
for-four issue—the fourth since listing
in 1956.
Moreover, further expansion will re-
sult if the takeover bid for Max Wurcker,
a Sydney drawing materials manu-
facturer, is successful. The bid and the
share issue will make earnings difficult
to maintain on the 1964 capital.
Share prices often weaken on a take-
over, and this may provide opportunities.
T ohn-Corden, a Melbourne - based
general merchant and importer, has
certainly made a substantial recovery
from the low it reached in 1961-62.
Earning rate was then 12.8 p.c. after
coming back from 14.9 p.c. in 1961 and
17.3 p.c. in 1960.
But in 1963 a substantial jump was
made to 18.6 p.c. and, in the latest year
to March 31 the figure came out at
18.3 p.c ■ —on capital increased by a
one-for-eight premium issue.
Dividends have been held at 10 p.c.
since 1961, when directors felt that the
earnings decline warranted a cut from
the 1960 rate of 12i p.c. As 1960
earnings rate equalled 17.3 p.c. and this
year’s is higher at 18.3 p.c., the possi-
bility of a return to the 12i p.c. dividend
in the current year is possible.


INVESTMENT SECTION
Confusion on Korman’s Stanhill
Will overseas money come to the rescue?
npHERE were some very confused people
A wandering around Melbourne last
week after the annual meeting of Stan-
hill Consolidated Ltd, where Mr Stanley
Korman said: “I shall not leave any
stones unturned until the group is resur-
rected.”
- As the company, unlike Factors, has
virtually no assets left now to be sold,
it is rather hard to imagine how such
a task could be accomplished, especially
as Mr Korman added that how he would
do it was “in the hands of Providence”.
He said negotiations, commenced in
London, were aimed at putting Stanhill
on its feet again, but these could not be
revealed at present.
He also said that an English group
had purchased, at full value, certain
Stanhill assets.
As the company is under receivership,
Mr Korman has no authority to carry
out a deal like this without the receiv-
ers’ approval. As a result, one of the
receivers, Mr P. D. George, stated that
he had not been consulted on the matter.
This statement threw the matter into
even more confusion. In an effort to
clear things up, The Bulletin contacted
Mr George, who managed to throw some
light on the matter.
It seems that a few Stanhill subsidi-
aries still hold assets which Mr Korman
intends to hang on to. Mr George used
the example of Stanhill Estates Pty Ltd,
which still has substantial land interests.
He said it was possible that Mr Kor-
man hoped to retain this land by using
overseas money to remove Stanhill
Estates from the pickle which the rest
of the group is in.
But, he said, it was hard to see how
such a move could enable Mr Korman
to save the whole organisation, as most
of the assets had already been realised.
It seemed more likely that these inter-
ests would be incorporated into the suc-
cessfully (so far) resurrected Factors Ltd.
Of course, if overseas money does
come to the rescue of this subsidiary or
any others, it should bring more money
into the coffers of the holding company.
Mr N. B. Sinclair, general manager of
Trustees Executors, said in April that the
amounts owing on the 63 p.c. debentures
could very well be paid in full. If so,
then overseas money should make this
payout a definite fact and, maybe, even
leave some surplus for the remaining
creditors.
If there is any surplus, one of the first
in line will be the State Superannuation
Board of NSW. Mr Sinclair was able
to make the April statement because the
High Court had upheld the NSW Sup-
reme Court decision that the Board’s
£250,000 debenture holding did not rank
equally for repayment with the normal
63 p.c. debentures because it .was not
issued in accordance with the trust deed.
It is believed that the Board will not
go to the Privy Council over the matter;
if it does, then the normal debenture
holders could still receive full payment
if the Board wins its case, because of
the extra money which could result from
Mr Korman’s English deal.
The AMI Puzzle
Friday, June 5, the ss. shares of
Australian Motor Industries rose on
the Melbourne Stock Exchange from
Thursday’s price of 3s. 3d. to a peak of
4s. 4d. before finishing the day at 4s. Id.
—up lOd. Earlier in the week they had
been selling at less than 3s. Turnover
on the Friday was 12,300 units, com-
pared with only 500 on the Thursday.
On the following Monday, prices came
back heavily to slightly more than 3s.
Obviously, someone “in the know”
was very eager to buy into the company
on the Friday. But in response to a
query from the Stock Exchange, AMI
chairman, Mr S. W. Byrne, said he knew
of no reason for the rise, apart from the
fact that trading was still producing
profits.
However, this was no reason for the
scrip to jump so high so suddenly. At
the annual meeting last October, share-
holders were told that operations had
been profitable since March, 1963, that
the group would ultimately return to a
a “good” profit basis and that a “sub-
stantial” earning rate was needed before
any ordinary dividend could be con-
sidered.
If some sort of deal is brewing, then
it would have to be a big one to warrant
the jump in share price. The company
has a paid ordinary capital of £l.B
million to service on top of £555,000
in preference shares on which more
than £lOO,OOO is in arrears. In the three
years to June 30, 1963, losses totalled
about £23 million.
So there are really only two possible
explanations for the rise. One is the
imminence of a takeover bid, but this
is shadowed by the fact that, in 1967,
the company’s two overseas backers will
have effective control of the group be-
cause of options they now hold which
could give them a 60 p.c. voting right.
The other reason is the off-chance that
the big parcel of shares in Rootes (UK)
to be purchased by Chrysler (USA) may
have some connection with AMI and its
overseas backers (Leyland Motors of the
UK and American Motor Corp. of the
USA).
Sugar is Sweet
fpHE Colonial Sugar Refining Co. Ltd
has at last produced earnings
appropriate to the size of the enterprise
and the high esteem in which it has
always been held by the market.
An earning rate of 12.4 p.c. on capital
was'the first consolidated result publish-
ed (in 1960-61) and this was a distinct
disappointment to investors instilled with
the idea that the company tucked a lot
away from the public eye.
Now the company reports an earning
rate of 30.6 p.c. and a 64 p.c. lift in
profit from last year’s record £4,506,817,
to £7,395,839 for the latest year to
March 31. Tax provision went up from
£3,453,040 to £4,771,891, and deprecia-
tion from £4,112,943 to £4,396,199.
This puts CSR second to BHP in
Australian public companies’ profit per-
formances (followed by Mt Isa Mines),
although in terms of capital it is only
ranked fourth after BHP, ICIANZ, and
Ampol.
While all subsidiaries contributed to
the bumper result that is, raw and
refined sugar, building materials,
chemicals, distillery products, shipping
and investment raw sugar milling in
Australia and Fiji was the main source
of increasing riches. The NZ profit was
practically as before.
Other sugar companies’ spectacular
trading results had only partly pre-
pared the market for CSR's good news.
The 20s. shares gained an extra 3s. 3d.
to 87s. in initial reaction, and at this
level even those who paid the top price
in 1961 of 925. 3d. are now in front,
after taking account of the one-for-seven
issue at 30s. in 1962-63.
The new dividend rate of 12J p.c.
is also more fitting to a stock which
claims leader status than the earlier
rather stingy distributions of 8 p.c.
(1958), 83 p.c. (1959) and 9 p.c. for
1960 and 1961. (It was improved to 93
p.c. and 10 p.c. in 1962 and 1963.)
Healing’s Lowered Dividend
Tt looks as though the shareholders of
A A. G. Healing, Melbourne-based

facturer, will not be seeing a return of
their old-established 15 p.c. dividend in
the current year. The directors have

year to December 31, indicating a 12
p.c. payout for the full year.
This would be in line with the 1962-
63 distribution, which was cut from 15
p.c. as part of an effort by the company
to conserve funds and build up reserves.
Directors said at the time that this would
accommodate “planned growth”.
Their move was wise, as the 1961-62
payout was covered by only 16 p.c. earn-
ings—last year they reached 17.9 p.c.
and should go higher for 1963-64.
The general decline in earnings, fol-
lowing the merger in November, 1960,
with A. E. Goodwin, has cast some
doubts on the real value of the merger
transaction. In 1959-60, before the
merger, they were 23 p.c. but came back
to 18.5 p.c. the following year despite
the fact that profit was more than
doubled.
It is hoped that the “planned growth”
will show some worthwhile results in
1964-65 by returning earnings to the
pre-merger level. Only then can share-
holders see the resumption of their old
15 p.c. dividend.

New Era for Crver

Oydney printer and stationer W. J.
Cryer and Co. Ltd begins a new
era on elimination of the greeting card
division, the chairman (Mr C. H. W.
Arthy) told shareholders at the annual
meeting.
Last year’s loss of £158,925, which
included write-downs on the card stocks
of £111,339, apparently frightened
management as much as investors.
Since the decision to quit this business,
group sales have shown some improve-
ment, mainly Avery labels and general
printing.
The Dulwich Hill land and buildings
have been independently valued at
£21,694 above book value of £160,306.
Likewise plant and machinery have
been assessed on the basis of utilisation
as a going concern, at £128,498 : above
the book value of £48,374. Directors
are also convinced that their present
market value is a great deal more than
their book value.

Important Book Announcement
"AUSTRALIA'S DEFENCE AND FOREIGN POLICY"
This book is of vital importance to all concerned
about Australia’s standing and future relationships
with Asia.
The 1964 Summer School of the Australian Institute of
Political Science dealt with this important subject. A
group of distinguished speakers gave their views on ques-
tions such as these: What are the underlying principles of
Australia’s External Policy? Can Australia have a policy
which differs from British and American views? How far
must our policy be modified by our defence preparations?
How far must it be modified by the attitude of the
major powers?
Commenting on this Summer School, the Bulletin
said it was: “One of the most important public
conferences held in Australia for many years.”
Every thinking Australian needs a better know-
ledge and understanding of the factors affecting
Australia’s Defence and Foreign Policy—this book
can give it to you. Read what th.ese leading
speakers had to say. Sir Garfield Barwick, then
Minister for External Affairs, dealt with Australia’s
Foreign Relations and made clear our determin-
ation to defend Malaysia. Mr. Roger Hilsman,
then U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Far
Eastern Affairs, looked at our situation and pos-
sible contribution to the Asian scene from the
standpoint of an outside but expert observer.
The more practical problems arising from our
strategic position were dealt with by Dr. T. B.
Millar and Professor R. I. Downing. Dr. B. D.
Beddie discussed our internal Australian scene and
the likely political problems which arise from
consideration of defence and foreign policy.

BHP Output a Good Pointer
With one month still to go, BHP pro-
” duction figures show increases over
the previous year in all sections except
the merchant mill and the tinplate plant.
Output of pig-iron to date is more
than 3,427,300 tons (12 p.c.) above the
previous corresponding 11 months.
Similarly steel ingot production is up
12 p.c. to 4,281,000 tons.
The No. 4 blast furnace at Port
Kembla was relined in April, accounting
for a significant reduction in pig-iron
production in that month.
Profit results for the year to May 31
should be out about the third week in
July. Dividend for the year has been
raised from Is. sd. per 20s. share to
Is. 6id., equal to 7.71 p.c on capital
Wormald Share Price Revives
A drift in Wormald Bros Industries
Ltd shares to 6s. Bd. in mid-May
attracted a few alert buyers who were
prepared to put the price up to Bs. for
the ss. shares.
The shares went down to 6s. 3d. last
year when earnings of 6.2 p.c. on
capital and a halving of the dividend to
5 p.c. were announced.
The interim report in March was more
comforting—dividend for the six months
to December was put up to 3 p.c., and
directors said orders were substantially
ahead of business booked either in the
June half of 1963 or the December half
of 1962.
Hooker aiul the Royal Exchange
Sydney Royal Exchange, which
A was bought out by a share, cash
and note exchange in mid-1960, has
been sold by L. J. Hooker Investment
Corporation to an unnamed English
group.
Hooker was a little reserved.about the
price, putting it “in the vicinity of” £|
million.
A year ago company executives said
the Royal Exchange site would not be
developed before 1966-67.
The holding costs would have been
high in the intervening four years, but
all the same Hooker should show a
profit on the sale of this property.
It used its share premium to great
effect for the purchase in 1960. The
Hooker shares were then between four
and five times par, and 82 p.c. of Royal
Exchange’s capital was secured by the
issue of Hooker shares.
The English buyer needs about £5
million to develop the property, demol-
ishing the present 113-year-old building
to erect a multi-storey office block, with
space for members of the Royal Ex-
change.
Although Hooker in its heyday would
have been undaunted by such a costly
developmental project, the present failure
of its shares to hold par on the market
weakens its bargaining power for loan
money.
Bigger Payout by Stramit?
JPhe possibility that Stramit Boards,
A Melbourne-based manufacturer of
building board and metal decking, will
lift its dividend in the current year to
June 30 is now far from remote. The
report for the December half-year, re-
leased in March, declared a 5 p.c. in-
terim after a six months profit of
£62,000. Profit in the full 1962-63 year
was £106,000 —almost three times the
1960 record of £36,000.
Last week the directors announced
that trading in this final quarter had
“never been busier”.
Last year’s profit equalled 25.8 p.c.
on capital. The £62,000 earned in the
December six months equalled an annual'
rate of 30 p.c. on capital. As it seems
that this rate may even be bettered when
the full year’s results are known, the
cover for a 10 p.c. dividend will be

Hotel Florida’s Ownership
TThe Hotel Florida at Terrigal, in the
central coast of NSW, is now
wholly-owned by Alliance Holdings Ltd.
Once owned by Latec Ltd, the com-
pany controlling the hotel was acquired
by Alliance and Holidaywise Ltd jointly
in September, 1963.
Holidaywise feels its resources will be
fully occupied in developing recent pro-
perty acquisitions and the new subsidi-
ary Travelwise Pty Ltd.
Suspicions on Turner Confirmed
fact that Turner Industries would
probably incur a loss in the current
financial year was generally accepted
among shareholders and investors.
Nevertheless, the directors showed sense
in Melbourne last week when they an-
nounced that it would definitely be so.
The writing went on the wall in Febru-
ary when the report for the six months
to December 31 revealed a group loss
of £16,000 and omitted the interim divi-
dend. The appliance division was the
main culprit—it incurred a loss of
£37,000 compared with a £30,000 profit
in the previous corresponding term. The
difficulties of this division were the main
cause of the 1962-63 profit drop from
£117,000 to £71,000 and the dividend
cut from 10 p.c. to 8 p.c.
The lawn-mower market was describ-
ed as “extremely competitive” and gross
profit margins fell in the tool and hard-
ware division. This was the case in the
saw division, too, which increased turn-
over but suffered considerably higher
labor charges. The directors said that
group trading in the final six months
would continue to be difficult.
The most important feature of last
week’s announcement was the statement
that most of these difficulties have now
been overcome through reorganisation.
This commenced last year with several
changes in the company’s top manage-
ment. The activities of the appliance
division have now been limited to Vic-
toria. Several unprofitable lines of
manufacture were discontinued and the
price of certain other products was lifted
where warranted.
In addition, moves have been made to
halt a falling off which showed up in
productive efficiency and stocks were
revalued where necessary to bring them
in line with currently realisable figures.
Whether all this reorganisation will
produce a dividend-paying situation in
1964-65 is uncertain, but some indication
should be given in the annual report or
at the annual meeting. So far, directors

Echoes of Last Year
Sydney auctioneer Geoff K. Gray
(Holdings) Ltd has once again re-
ported that turnover for the December
half-year was a record, but profit only
“satisfactory”.
Directors repeat this year that the divi-
dend rate should be maintained, and
they echo last year’s interim statement
that costs of establishing new avenues
of business and additional premises were
written off.
After a similar interim report last
year, profit fell 40 p.c. from £38,186 to
£23,231. The earning rate was then
21.7 p.c. from which a 15 p.c. dividend
was distributed.
At 13s. the ss. shares yield 5.8 p.c.
and look fully priced.
Woollen Merchant Troubled
/Conditions in the_woollen textile in-
dustry continue to be difficult, hence
Wenzel, Batty and McGrath Ltd made
another loss in the six months to
April 30.
As woollen and trimming merchants,
Wenzel, Batty has been struggling for
the last three and a half years. A loss
was recorded for the last year to October
31, and no dividend was paid.
Under the influence of the interim
news, including no dividend again, the
ss. shares eased below half par level.
Pioneer S. Capital Moves
A one-for-five issue at 300 p.c. pre-
mium will provide £1.2 million of
the £1.5 million required to expand the
two sugar crushing mills of Pioneer
Sugar Mills Ltd.
Paid capital advances £300,000 to £l.B
million. Directors say a reconstruction
of the company’s capital will be made
soon.
With the shares cum rights at about
seven times par and earning rate of 81.7
p.c., capital could bear some watering.
Pioneer Sugar has had the most spec-
tacular profit leap of all the sugar com-
panies in the latest bumper season.
p.c. at NRMA
rpHE NRMA’s finance company, Car
Credits Pty Ltd, has reduced its
interest rate from 6 p.c. to 5} p.c. flat,
thus providing more competition in the
hire-purchase field.
With the NRMA, however, it is
necessary for the purchaser of a vehicle
to put up 50 p.c. of the price as a
deposit before he can obtain finance.
Only new vehicles are accepted and
the applicant must be over 21 years of
age.

James Hardie’s Leap Year
HThe year to March 31, 1964, was
apparently a leap year for fibro and
building materials maker, James Hardie
Asbestos Ltd.
Although the information provided by
the preliminary report was insufficient
to make proper comparison (no figures
being available for tax, depreciation or
profit or loss on sale of assets), it is
evident that the company enjoyed sub-
stantially better trading conditions.
The dividend, as previously an-
nounced, was raised from 10 to 13! p.c.,
but the rate will revert to 10 p.c. after
the one-for-four par issue to be made
shortly.
Less Profit in CIG Sales
Tndustrial disturbance in Victoria was
blamed for the slightly lower profit
earned in the half-year to March 28 by
Commonwealth Industrial Gases Ltd.
Sales, however, rose 4! p.c. to £7
million.
In the last year to September, CIG
earned record profits. Earning rate was
27.6 p.c., compared with dividend of
11 p.c.
The 20s. shares, tightly held by Bri-
tish Oxygen and patient local investors
with the long-term view, sell around
£5 35., to yield 2.1 p.c.
PGH Marches On
T>ROFit of PGH Industries Ltd for the
A nine months to March 31, 1964, at
£249,927, is 14 p.c. ahead of the com-
parable period of the year before.
The latest quarter shows an 18 p.c.
improvement over the similar period for
1963.
Results to date give an annual earning
rate of approximately 23.5 p.c., compared
with the 23.8 p.c. actually achieved in
the full year 1962-63.
Shares of this manufacturer of cera-
mics, furniture, wood, industrial and
aluminium products now stand at about
245., where the yield is a modest 3.5 p.c.
Mutual Encouragement
HTwo items arose in Melbourne last
week to encourage shareholders in
the reorganising Mutual Stores Holdings.
First, several large UK institutions which
hold substantial share interests announc-
ed their support of the reconstruction
plans—basically, these are to give one
unit in Mutual Stores Freehold Property
Investments for every three held in the
old company. This will cut paid capital
by two-thirds and so create the oppor-
tunity for establishing a respectable earn-
ing rate.
Second, it was revealed that the new
company would have a net tangible asset
backing of about 9s. for each ss. share.
This, plus the fact that directors expect
to pay dividends of not less than 6 p.c.,
augurs well for the new shares when they
are listed.
Although all the group’s property will
not be income-producing until August,
last year’s loss will still be eliminated in
the current year to July 31. In the
latest half to January 31, profit equal-
led slightly less than 2 p.c. on the old
capital —on the new capital it would
therefore equal around 6 p.c. The loss
last year was £37,000. The director’s
dividend forecasts do not apply until
1964-65.
Despite all this encouragement, there
is still one factor which could dampen
shareholders’ enthusiasm - they do not
know what interest is payable on a long-
term loan of £1 million from the Aus-
tralian Temperance and General Mutual
Life Assurance Society. As interest
charges will play a large part in the new
company’s chances of success (see The
Bulletin, May 30, p. 66), they are en-
titled to know exactly what the figure is.

Cwan Brewery Co. Ltd has paid
about £216,500 for the building

around 275. 9d.). Swan had bought the
freehold in 1962-63.
The 1963-64 results will be to hand

Lubricating Oil Plant
Saves £8m Imports
T'he opening of a lubricating oil plant at Shell’s Geelong
(Vic.) centre means that the refinery can now produce
virtually any oil-derived product, from road bitumen to wax
and washing detergents. The new plant will produce base
lubricating oil stocks, which will be distributed via road and
sea to other Australian Shell installations, where they will be
blended into finished oils for the automotive and industrial
lubricants market.
Unlike the refinery as a whole, it will not have to rely
directly on an outside source for its raw material. Thus, the
“reduced crude” or “long residue” left after the first step in
refining crude oil, will be supplied by the rest of the refinery
itself. As a whole, the complete refinery is now dependent on
only one thing the crude oil supplies, usually from the
Middle East. (It even generates its own power, enough to
serve the needs of a city of 50,000 people.) Because of the
distance factor, Moonie oil will not be going to Geelong but
to the Clyde (NSW) installation, which has already received
its first delivery.
Until now, Shell in Australia was also dependent on the
importing of the base stocks for blending. But the new plant
is capable of producing 80,000 tons a year—sufficient to sup-
port the company’s national market and still leave a surplus
for export, possibly to New Zealand. About £8 million is
expected to be saved in foreign exchange. However, the plant
is at present producing at the rate of only 60,000 tons and will
not reach the expected capacity until a few small wrinkles in
the set-up have been ironed out.
Australia now has three lubricating oil plants. The two
others are run by BP at Kwinana and Caltex-Ampol-Sleigh at
Kurnell. This shows the economy’s trend towards industriali-
zation. So do the figures. When the Geelong refinery was
built in 1954, only 20 p.c. of the works were Australian made.
The new plant has 90 p.c. local content.
A Whale of a Time
Without Whales
'VTor’-west Whaling and Whale Industries both decided to
abandon their whaling activities about a year ago. In
Nor’-West’s year to March 31, 1963, a loss of £ll,OOO was
chalked up after the company had caught only 68 humpbacks
—its quota was 450. Subsequently, humpback whaling was
abandoned altogether and it decided to establish a prawning
industry at Shark Bay in northern WA, as well as to investigate
the economics of sperm whaling.
Whale Industries struck similar trouble, but instead of
sticking to the sea for a living the directors decided to sell
out altogether and move into the pastoral industry. It now
has two properties, one at Gurley and one at Finley. About
20,000 sheep are run and 20,000 acres are under wheat, oats,
barley, sorghum and linseed. A subsidiary grows lucerne and
grain under irrigation and fattens cattle.
To date, Whale Industries’ changeover has proved to be
the more successful by far, though it should be remembered
that its changeover moves started a little earlier than Nor-
West's. Two recent reports from the companies show the
full extent of Whale’s success.
Its 1962 year to September 30 turned in a loss of £220,000.
Last year a profit of £5OOO was made and this did not include
a wool cheque which is believed to be in the vicinity of
£50,000. In the current year, balance date has been changed
to June 30. Although the recent report for the six months
to March 31 talked only of “satisfactory seasonal conditions”,
the profit improvement will undoubtedly be substantial, mainly
because of the wool cheque. Directors have already said that
they expect to resume dividends this year—its first as a purely
non-whaling enterprise.
Nor’-West’s story is somewhat different. Recent prelimi-
nary results show that the 1963 loss of £ll,OOO grew to
£150,000 in the 1964 year to March 31. Humpback whaling
has ceased altogether and the prospects of sperm whaling at
Carnarvon have been found to be uneconomical. However,
Fremantle is now being considered as a station for sperm
whaling. The prawning operations are said to be proceeding
“satisfactorily”.
It will be some time before Nor’-West can be in the same
dividend-paying position as Whale Industries. No-one knows
how “satisfactory” the prawning is and the Fremantle station
will not be operating for nine months—even then its success
will depend on the quota granted by the Commonwealth
Government. This is still under negotiation. It seems that
Nor’-West could be backing a losing industry, but one hopes
that its plans will eventually turn out to be as successful
as those adopted by Whale Industries.
Motor Vehicle Registrations
to Flatten Out?
"VTew motor vehicle registrations have kept at a very heady
level lately. Last year produced a solid 16 p.c. advance
on 1962, which itself had shown a quite dramatic 36 p.c. lift
on 1961.
There are some expectations, however, that the market will
flatten out to just over 400,000 vehicles in 1964 and 1965.
This particular estimate has been put forward at the Motor
Vehicle Forecasting Conference of W. D. Scott and Co. Pty
Ltd.
Such a high rate of sales indicates continuance of a pros-
perous overall economy.
Scotts also assume that there will be no increase in the
sales tax on motor vehicles. They believe the new vehicle
market is at present particularly price-sensitive. In this condi-
tion a sales tax rise to, say, 30 p.c. could produce quite a
substantial drop in demand, Scotts conclude.

Reticent Gordon & Gotch In High Favor
Spectacular earnings may still be subject to set-backs
By ROGER RANDERSON
Mr G. Sutherland Smith satisfy
’ ’ his fellow-shareholders in Gordon
and Gotch (Australasia) Limited with
the eight short sentences which the
annual report indicates will constitute his
chairman’s address at the annual meet-
ing to b held in Melbourne on Friday
of next week?
Shareholders may well be content,
strange though this may seem. They
have never demurred in previous years.
Gordon and Gotch shareholders will
have in their hands on the day of the
meeting their final dividend cheques at
the unchanged rate of 20 p.c.—and this,
too, at the end of a year when their
holdings have been increased a fifth by
a bonus'issue.
Brevity is the soul of wit, good wine
needs no bush—and all that.
But the company would never be a
contender for a prize in those annual
competitions for the most attractive and
informative annual reports.
Notwithstanding the new Companies
Acts, the unremitting efforts by the Press
in seeking out all relevant facts to place
before investors, and the demand for
detailed information to assist the modern
trend in this country towards scientific
investment analysis, Gordon and Gotch
stands out as one of the least com-
municative of our important listed com-
panies.
These preliminary remarks should not
be misconstrued. The directors have no
skeletons in the cupboard. They have
never dressed up the company’s accounts
to exaggerate its strength and earning-
power. Rewards for shareholders have
been considerable.
Investors are more wide awake and
taking longer views than they did in
1960-61, following a stiff premium issue
and temporary reduction in the divi-
dend, when the price of the ordinary ss.
share was allowed to fall to as little as
13s.
Perhaps they have now taken the
measure of a conservative board in
marking up the price to 31s. 6d. a share.
Whether there has been some over-
compensation for previous doubts; and
whether, having regard to future pros-
pects, the share is now too dear or still
cheap are the investment matters arising
for consideration.
Gordon and Gotch increased its earn-
ings by £48,379 to a record £559,568
in the year ended March 31. This
result was achieved after charging
£84,510 depreciation (or £2,989 less)
and providing £482,462 for income tax
(or £41,282 more).
It may seem that profit was higher
than stated, if the income tax provision
is related to Australian rates. However,
a large part of the company’s profits is
earned in New Zealand —and the annual
report is silent about the sources of
profit geographically as well as function-
ally.
The earning rate on £1,712,434
ordinary capital (after the one-for-five
bonus issue) was 32.2 p.c. for 1963-64,
compared with 35.2 p.c. for 1962-63 on
the previous £1,427,028 of ordinary
capital.
But for the bonus issue, ordinary
earning rate would have moved up from
35.2 to 38.6 p.c. Alternatively, the rate
may be regarded as having moved up
from 29.3 to 32.2 p.c. on present capital.
Maintenance of the 20 p.c. ordinary
rate, despite the bonus issue, increased
dividend payments to £350,488, but re-
duced the comfortable surplus of re-
tained earnings by only about £9,000 to
£209,080.
This was a pleasant surprise for the
share market, which has reacted by
marking up the price of the share from
this year’s low point of 265. to the
present 31s. 6d.
Assuming recent results can be sus-
tained, the present price yields 3.2 p.c.
in dividends from 5.3 p.c. earnings. Past
history provides significant pointers to
the possibility of these results con-
tinuing without interruption.
Today the company is by far the
largest wholesale newsagent, bookseller
and stationer in Australia and New
Zealand. Here it has branches in all
State capitals and also at Townsville and
Launceston. Across the Tasman it has

Gordon and Gotch, besides dis-
tributing locally a host of local and im-
ported publications and exporting them
to South-east Asia, is an important
paper merchant and supplier of printers’
machinery and requisites.
During the past year a subsidiary,
Lonsdale and Bartholomew (Aust.) Pty
Ltd, sold its old premises at a satis-
factory price and moved into a new
factory.
The latest project is to build a new
warehouse at Wellington (NZ). Although
plans for this have not yet been com-
pleted, the existing leasehold property
has been revalued at £NZ72,693.
The balance sheet shows a position of
marked strength. Present ordinary
capital is backed by reserves of almost
twice as much, including £763,564 in
revaluation and share premiums’
accounts (in ratio of more than one-for-
two to capital). Long-term liabilities are
negligible.
Working capital is more than ample,
and it includes more than £1 million of
cash and near-cash. As the table below
indicates, this extreme liquidity has been
built up during the past three years, over
the same period as £381,200 of loans on
mortgage have been repaid. (Current
liabilities in the table below include
£50,000 of mortgage loans due within
12 months.)
Dividends from Gordon and Gotch
have been quite prolific. From 1946-47
to 1951-52 inclusive 20 p.c. was regu-
larly paid, the three-for-ten bonus issue
in June, 1950, having had no effect on
the dividend.
The rate was increased to 22} p.c. for
1952-53 and again to 25 p.c. for 1953-
54.
A reduction to 183- p.c. occurred after
the company in June, 1954, made a one-
for-two bonus issue, with a cash issue
of one-for-three at par immediately
following.
By 1959-60, however, the rate had
been restored to 20 p.c.
The market was shaken when the
company in June, 1960, made a one-for-
ten cash issue at an unusually high
premium (charging shareholders 18s. for
each new ss. share) and in the following
year reduced the dividend to 16J p.c.

Although the dividend at present
looks secure at the 20 p.c. rate of the
past two years, the possibility of re-
ductions over periods that to investors
at the time seem lengthy cannot be
ignored.
Experience in recent years is a re-
minder that Gordon and Gotch is not
immune from temporary set - backs
arising from shipping hold-ups, and
fluctuations in paper prices, credit and
external trade policies.
Mr G. Sutherland Smith has given
notice that he will tell his shareholders
next week: “Future prospects seem
bright, but costs are still rising, oversea
freight rates are higher, salaries and
wages are increasing, and long service
leave is being extended.”
There is no mistaking the warning
tone of this statement, although in-
vestors who can afford to lock the shares
away may reasonably expect Gordon
and Gotch to repeat many of its past
benefits in the long run.
My own feeling is that the share is
dear enough for the time being. It still
falls short of the status of a “blue chip”,
despite the company’s spectacular earn-
ing capacity, so that 3.2 p.c. dividend
yield, when based on a high dividend
rate, should be required by investors.

SECURITY ANALYSIS
A Look at Burns Philp to 1976
Remarkable growth rate could go on and on
Ane of the companies which managed
to retain their glamor after the first
accounts were published under the re-
quirements of the new Companies Act
is Burns Philp & Co. Ltd. The recent
announcement of yet another bonus
issue had the effect of pushing the 20s.
shares up as high as 115 s.
Ignoring the peaks and troughs of
the share price graph, it looks as though
the trend line of the prices has an up-
ward gradient which suggests that the
general level has increased by over 261
p.c. in the last six months. During this
same period the All Ordinary Index has
increased 7+ p.c. on the same basis.
In the latter half of 1963 the shares
moved but slightly, ranging between 795.
and 895., but in mid-January they rose
rapidly from 89s. to 100 s. before settling
down around 98s. This price level then
persisted for three months, but in the
week before that in which the bonus
issue was announced they rose to
109 s. 6d.
While the chartists may be able to
point to a “pennant" in the price graph
which predicted the breakout upwards
to this high point of 1155., other inves-
tors may well have been taken by sur-
prise by a bonus issue announcement
made only 35 days after the announce-
ment of the final dividend for the year
ended March 31 last.
The “new era” of bonus issues com-
menced in 1958, when a l-for-4 issue
was made as at April 30. The next issue
followed 18 months later in October,
1959, but three years then elapsed until
the next issue in October, 1962. Now
the fourth issue follows exactly two years
after the third, but the bonus shares
issued are 25 p.c. more than on the
previous occasion.
"jV/fANY people must now be wondering
'*■*■*■ whether future growth has been
fully discounted. The past record has
been excellent and dividend income has
been increasing steadily over the last ten
years at a rate of about 9 p.c. per annum.
In recent years this rate has been
exceeded and in the five years from 1962
to 1966 the compound rate of increase
will be near to 11 p.c. per annum.
It seems likely that at current prices
the market is expecting a continuation of
this rate of growth for the next ten years
at least, and it will be interesting to
examine the prospects of the dividend
increases continuing for that period.
First, it is necessary to work out what
the dividend payout will amount to if
this rate of increase of 11 p.c. per
annum continues until, say, 1976. The
payout in that year will need to be about
£2.55 million, which means that if the
10 p.c. rate is still in vogue, capital will
have had to increase by bonus issues
to £25.5 million. While this may look
astronomical, the target would be sur-
passed if a l-for-5 bonus issue were made
every two years up to and including
1974.
However, the key to bonus issues is
not assets values (although it seems that
assets need to be revalued to produce
the appropriate reserves from the Tax
Commissioner's viewpoint) but profits.
In the case of Burns Philp, a sizable
part of the available profits arises from
income from investments. While it is
necessary to make a few guesses, it
seems likely that this income (after de-
ducting income tax applicable to it, but
ignoring any expenses incurred in the
collection of the income or the admini-
stration of the portfolio) would be of the
order of £BOO,OOO. Thus investment in-
come alone is sufficient to cover the
1963-64 dividend payment about 1.1
times, but will need to increase by 124
p.c., or about 6 p.c. per annum, to meet
the dividend commitment for 1965-66
which will be £900,000.
Unfortunately, we are quite unable to
assess the rate of growth of “Income
from Investments" from the published
profit statements since the item has been
disclosed for only the last two years.
We might tackle the problem in many
ways, but as it is believed that about
60 p.c. of the equity portfolio consists
of shares in G. J. Coles and Queensland
Insurance, we could make some prognos-
tications of the growth of this section
on the basis of the growth that has taken
place in these companies’ dividends in
the past.
Strangely enough both companies have
increased their dividends at such rates
that an estimate of 6 p.c. per annum
would not seem unreasonable, but, being
conservative, we will assume 5 p.c. From
this we can make the assumption that
income of the present equity investments
will increase by 88 p.c. by 1976.
The book value of the parent com-
pany’s investments just about doubled
over the five years to March 31, 1963,
and it would not be unreasonable to
assume a level increase of, say, £1 mil-
lion per annum. This would mean that
investments at cost would be £l3 million
greater in 1976 than they were in 1963.
Just what the average return of this
new money is likely to amount to is
very difficult to estimate, but for the
sake of this exercise we will assume that
it will earn about 4 p.c. net. We will
also assume that income from other
investments will remain constant and that
tax rates will not change.
From this we could come to the con-
clusion that investment income net of
tax would be about £1.6 million in
1975-76, and it is apparent that the
past rate of growth in dividend payout
cannot be sustained from investment
income alone.
While we would be guessing, it
appears likely that for the past six years
investment income has been sufficient to
cover the dividend payout. It may be
that, following the example of the
general insurance companies, limiting
dividend payout to investment income is
the present policy of Burns Philp's
board.
Tn the table below, dividend payout is
A expressed as a percentage of the book
value of investments by the parent, ex-
eluding investments in subsidiaries
(column A), and in column B as a
percentage of the assumed total invest-
ment of the group on the basis that,
for the years to 1962 inclusive, invest-
ment by subsidiaries was equivalent to
10 p.c. of the parent company's invest-
ment: —
Year to March 31 A B
1958 7.1 6.5
1959 7.8 7.2
1960 6.5 5.9
1961 5.4 4.9
1962 5.5 5.0
1963 5.7 5.0
On the same basis investment income
in the 1962-63 year represented 6.7 p.c.
of the book value of investments.
It is, perhaps, as well to point out
that just to meet the dividend require-
ment, if the required rate of growth is
to be achieved, income from other
sources than the investment portfolio
will need to reach £1 million by 1975-76.
However, if this other income increases
at the average rate of 5 p.c. per annum
over the period, the target will be met.
It therefore seems quite possible for
Burns Philp’s earnings to increase at the
required rate even though this would
leave little margin for any divergency.
We can only come to the conclusion
that the shares are fully priced at cur-
rent levels of 115s. to show a yield of
only 2.2 p.c. after the bonus issue.

The importance of Mortgage Protection
Like most people, you have probably arranged a mortgage
to finance the ownership of your home, and have arranged
to pay it off from future earnings over ten, fifteen or more
years.
There is, of course, no problem so long as you can continue
your repayments. But what if you were no longer here? If
death were to strike too early? Could your wife take up the
obligation without hardship?
You have, no doubt, protected your home with fire insurance,
and almost certainly you have taken out a life assurance
policy to provide for your family’s financial security.
These are not always enough.
If your wife should be left with the responsibility of your
new home and its mortgage, she would indeed be helped by
those other safeguards in the way of assurance, savings or
stocks and shares. But she would need them for the
children’s education, and for security in later years. They
would probably not cover the mortgage repayments as well.
There is an inexpensive—extremely valuable—answer:
CUSTOMLIFE PLANNED MORTGAGE PROTECTION POLICY.
This plan costs little, and is best explained by example:
A man, 34 years of age, is committed to repay, say, £2O per
month for the next 20 years—a total of £4,800 over the
period.
He could cover this responsibility by taking out a £1,200
Mortgage Protection Plan, with payments of a monthly
premium of only £3.8.0.
Benefits:
Should he die within the period of 20 years, his widow would
receive the following immediate payments during the years as
listed, and this amount would always cover the reducing
mortgage.
Ist Year—£4,Boo
2nd Year—£4,62o
3rd Year—£4,44o
4th Year—£4,26o
sth Year—£4,oBo
6th Year—£3,9oo
7th Year—£3,72o
Bth Year—£3,s4o
9th Year—£3,36o
10th Year—£3,lBo
11th Year—£3,ooo
12th Year—£2,B2o
13th Year—£2,64o
14th Year—£2,46o
15th Year—£2,2Bo
16th Year—£2,loo
17th Year—£l,92o
18th Year—£l,74o
19th Year—£l,s6o
20th Year—£l,3Bo
Thus, at the end of 20 years, when the mortgage is cleared,
the Sum Assured would still be £1,200, plus alf bonuses added
over the period. This policy then continues as a Whole of
Life Policy and the premium is then reduced to £2.15.0 per
month.

BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS
Kathleen Investments Market
Bound to Recoil Soon
A premium issue by a mining com-
pany is unusual, yet this was the
move chosen by Kathleen Investments
(Australia) Ltd at a time when its major
source of income (dividends from Mary
Kathleen Uranium Ltd) is cutting out.
Having paid dividends of 86.6 p.c.
(4s. Bd. a share) in 1963, and over 100
p.c. in the two previous years, directors
now advise in their annual report that
without taking into account income to
be received from subsidiaries in 1965,
they will have sufficient in hand from
MKU dividends to maintain a 25 p.c.
dividend (tax-free) on the expanded
capital until February, 1966.
Small wonder, then, that the shares
have skidded from a top price of
245. 9d. this year to 16s. 6d. in May.
Shareholders as at June 19 are entitled
to the one-for-four issue of ss. shares
at ss. premium. The present price of
18s. would give an average cost after
the issue of 16s. sd.
The company requires the £474,130
to finance the installation of new equip-
ment for its ilmenite subsidiary, Cable
(1956) Ltd at Bunbury and complete the
development of a tin field at Moolyella,
near Marble Bar, both in WA.
Kathleen Investments was incorpora-
ted in 1958 ‘o take over the 35 p.c. in-
terest held by Australasian Oil Explora-
tion Ltd in Mary Kathleen Uranium Ltd.
The object was to pay shareholders the
ultimate in income tax-free dividends
from MKU. The chairman (Sir John
Northcott) pointed out last May that
during the last four years the company
had distributed £3,375,655 (£1 Is. sd.
per ss. unit) from £3,629,152 received
from MKU.
HThe MKU mine was closed down and
put on a care and maintenance basis
from December 2, 1963. After payment
of a final 3s. 6d. dividend, and repay-
ment of preference shares and interest
thereon, MKU will have £2.1 million
cash to maintain the mine during the
shut down and to reopen it.
A change in the method of valuation
of uranium drummed and waiting for
shipment reduced MKU's 1963 profit of
£3.2 million by £1.5 million, which will
be brought into 1964 accounts.
While awaiting a resumption of MKU
mining operations, Kathleen has had to
turn to other mining interests, particu-
larly those with prospects of early re-
turns. The beach sand industry offered
the best prospects.
Kathleen owns a 94.5 p.c. interest in
Coffs Harbour Rutile NL which in turn
owns half Rutile and Zircon Mines (New-
castle) Ltd. This company has con-
tracts to supply 220,000 tons of rutile
to E. I. Du Pont de Nemours and Co.
up to October 1, 1967.
To meet contractual commitments, the
throughput capacity of the wet concen-
trating plant has been expanded from
14 mill, to 17 mill, tons a year, and of
the dry plant treatment capacities from
37,500 to 50,000 tons of rutile.
Cable (1956) Ltd, a wholly owned sub-
sidiary, has operated an ilmenite deposit
of Bunbury (WA) since 1957. Pro-
duction capacity of the plant is being
lifted to 100,000 tons a year, and
equipment is being installed to extract
zircon and monazite.
Directors claim that this ilmenite is
one of the most sought after in the world
today, and orders have been received
exceeding plant capacity. An Ameri-
can firm has contracted to take 50,000
tons of ilmenite a year for five years,
and Japan will take the balance of the
output.
Cable has explored other ilmenite
reserves in WA which may warrant in-
stallation of a new plant, and it has also
investigated the promising tin field at
Moolyella. An overseas firm is negoti-
ating for a partnership in the tin venture.
A silo of 16,000 tons capacity is being
installed at Bunbury wharf, two miles
from the dredging operation.
Australasian Oil Exploration, 99.8 p.c.
owned by Kathleen, purchased a free-
hold farm in Brisbane in 1963 with esti-
mated reserves of 3 million tons of blue
metal, and a lease was obtained on a 13
million ton blue metal deposit at South-
port. AOE has reserves of a further 3
million tons near Brisbane, and it also
has properties for rental at Mermaid
Beach.
The future return to Kathleen from
uranium is considered to be substantial,
and with a view to consolidating its
uranium interests, it bought the remain-
ing 51 p.c. interest in Queensland Mines
Ltd from Factors Ltd, paid for by a
placement of 195,000 5s. shares at a
discount on the market price.
Queensland Mines owns Andersons
Lode, a fully developed uranium deposit
only ten miles from Mount Isa, which
would allow production at low capital
cost when the market for uranium im-
proves. It also owns the Skal lease,
which has not been fully developed.
Touring 1963 Kathleen wrote up its
investment in MKU from par to 8s.
each, an increase of £298,470. Present
book valuation of this investment is
£795,920, although its market valuation
at balance date was £1,890,310.
Reserves of £1,095,568 at December
31 supported capital of £898,681. Divi-
dends received from MKU totalled
£994,900 in 1963.
The discontinuance of dividends from
MKU, after last May’s receipt of 3s. 6d.
a share, until resumption of mining, will
bring such a slump in Kathleen’s pro-
fit this year that the market would not
be human if it did not recoil when 1964
figures are published.
Although the medium and longer-term
prospects are of great interest, a few
lean years in the interim should give
investors ample opportunities for entry
at prices below the present level.

All Things Conspire Favorably
Wool and produce broker, stock and
" station agent, Younghusband Ltd
had a record year in the period to March
31, 1964, and reverted to a 10 p.c.
dividend.
The company has tailored its dividend
over the years pretty much according to
its results and immediate prospects,
rather than holding fast to a predeter-
mined rate.
Everything was in Younghusband’s
favor last year. Buoyant wool-market,
higher stock prices, a good season and
generally stable economic conditions all
contributed to the company’s first pre-
tax result beyond the £500,000 mark.
The business was founded in 1889. It
became a public company in 1920. Ten
years ago shareholders participated in
a two-for-five par issue, seven years ago
in a one-for-five at par. The last capital
move was a one-for-five bonus from
assets revaluation, accompanied by a
share split to ss. units.
Younghusband operates 23 branch
offices in its own 'name, chiefly in the
north of Victoria, 27 others in the
Riverina district of NSW, four under
the name of L. A. Fairbairn and Co.
and one in the name of MacLeod and
Booth, in Victoria. Departments handle
wool, merchandise, insurance, stock, stud
stock, produce, wine and spirits, property
and real estate.
Average price paid at auction for
greasy wool in the first nine months of
the season beginning July 1, 1963, was
72.02 d., up 22.78 p.c. over the corres-
ponding previous period. The overall
average price per bale for the same
period was £9l 19s. sd. compared with
the previous figure of £74 9s. 3d.
Since mid-March there has been a
moderate decline in wool prices, but
as the chairman (Mr T. C. Trumble)
put it: ‘The statistical position of wool
is still considered sound.”
Net trading result for 1963-64 was
£314,939 profit after £192,000 tax pro-
vision and £56,166 depreciation charge.
This was 31 p.c. better than the previous
year's profit. Earning rate accelerated
from 13.6 p.c. to 17.8 p.c.
Younghusband doesn't rely on loan
capital. Its share capital of £1,764,000
is supported by share premium reserve
of £276,250, capital profit £112,488.
assets revaluation £lBO,OOO, general


reserve £438,595, and profit and loss
appropriation account £191,557.
Debtors, net of provisions, increased
over the last year from £2,838,592 to
£3,415,004.
Younghusband ss. shares are mainly
for the income-minded investor. At the
present time the return is only 5.3 p.c.
The price of 9s. 6d. is not sufficient to
justify selling out.
On the other hand prospective buyers
might wait until a down-swing in wool
prices brings the shares to a cheaper
entry level. There is always the prospect
that one of the big brothers in the wool-
broking field will see advantage in
acquiring the business. This has, how-
ever, been a possibility for a long time.

Benefits to Sweeten Yield?
International Combustion’s discipline of patience
T atest news from Sydney boiler plant
maker and designer, International
Combustion Australia Ltd, was the
receipt of a £9,934,521 order from the
NSW Electricity Commission in May,
1964.
It was for two 350 megawatt reheat
boilers for the Munmorah power station.
A similar installation was made in 1962.
On publication of accounts for the
year to September 30, 1963, shareholders
were told that all departments of the
company were working to full capacity.
The new orders will no doubt prolong
that happy situation.
The company was set up as a sub-
sidiary of International Combustion, of
London, in 1929. It became a public
company in 1949, and in 1954 the parent
made available a block of 374,000 ss.
ordinary shares to Australian investors.
Majority control was relinquished by
the parent, but it still retained a sub-
stantial financial interest, as well as
technical and trading liaison with the
Australian company.
The English company is one of the
leading manufacturers of steam-raising
plant in the UK. The local company
specialises in the design, manufacture,
supply and installation of steam-raising
plant and associated equipment for power
stations generating electricity and steam.
Customers are government authorities,
councils and industrial firms.
Modern works are established on
freehold at Rydalmere, NSW. In the
decade since listing, the local content of
plant for contracts has been on the
increase. The chairman said, in 1954,
that the effect of such local manufacture
on future profits should be considerable.
Dividends have been 15 p.c. for the
last 11 years and seem wedded to this
rate. A bonus could be paid any time
that trading conditions made the
company feel particularly affluent.
Tangible asset backing at last count
(September, 1963) was 13s. 3d. per ss.
ordinary share. Capital is a tight
£512,000 in ordinaries and £200,000 in
preference shares.
Earning rate has been consistently
high, averaging 32.1 p.c. in the last five
years. The only issue since listing was
a three-for-five at par in November,
1957, which was not fully paid up until
May, 1962. Liquidity has therefore not
been much of a problem. There are no
long term liabilities.
In the last full trading year, profit
advanced slightly, from £155,899 to
£158,681, after providing £16,498 for
depreciation (£15,942 the year before)
and £108,354 (£102,900) for tax.
The half-year to March, 1964 was a
“successful” one. There were no
unusual factors affecting the company’s
earning capacity.
At 22s. 6d. the shares currently return
3.3 p.c. Investors obviously hope for
some benefits to sweeten the yield. They
may have to be patient a few more years
yet.
As there is a fairly constant “bottom”
in the share price each year, it may be
worth waiting for the shares once again
to slip nearer the 17s. mark, rather than
rush in now.

Tax is a Game
Taxation Institute of Australia
held its 11th taxation convention at
Terrigal (NSW) from June 5 to 7, at
which papers were delivered on “What
the Tax Act Taxes” by Mr Russell W.
Fox, QC, and “Some of the Principles
for Determining Income Tax Deduc-
tions” by Miss A. M. Magoffin, FCA.
Miss Magoffin says the word “income”
is not defined in the Tax Act. Assessable
Income is the basis on which everything
begins, and evidently where all headaches
start.
Some learned gentlemen also became
perplexed at its diverse interpretations
and, at a Court of Appeal in London,
when dealing with the subject of enter-
taining expenses, Lord Evershed said to
counsel: “It really shocks me, it really
does; that is why income tax is a sort
of game, a battle of ingenuity, unrelat-
ed to any principle of commonsense or
ethical considerations, and it is extre-.
mely bad for respect for the law. I can
only plead that some time some day
those who instruct you will pay regard
to the prestige of the law and possibly
the welfare of society.”

Largest Soap-maker
HThe Soviet Union is, surprisingly, the
largest soap-maker in the world. In
1962 it produced more than 1.5 million
tons, a quantity exceeding the combined
production of 15 countries of Western
Europe (1,360,000 tons) and Oceania
(118,000 tons).
Japan’s Bumper Rice Crop
Japan’s rice crop in 1963-64 is
** estimated to be the second largest in
the country’s history. The estimate is
for a crop of more than 12.8 million
tons, just 200,000 tons under the record
high set in 1962.
Good weather and technical improve-
ments helped farmers harvest the bumper
crop.

SPECULATOR’S DIARY
On Not Being an Institution
Buying shares in the old-fashioned tvay
VTow that we’ve had the decision on
the basic wage, the next thing is
the Budget in August. With everyone
talking of inflation, the Budget is bound
to aim for a surplus and so it will prob-
ably involve some form of increased
taxation.
Perhaps it is the anticipation of such
a Budget that is keeping the market
down. (One comment says it is at its
lowest point since the depression!) On
the other hand it’s more likely to be the
lack of institutional buying on the open
market. Potter and his merry men have
been the main instigators of this state
of affairs.
As I’m not an institution, I have to go
about buying shares in the old-fashioned
way. The first purchase this week was
James Hardie. Because it has been in
and out of the portfolio so many times
over the years, it deserves a special place
of honor.
At the beginning of this month,
directors announced a 40 p.c. increase in
profit to a record figure of £904,000.
As a result, earning rate moves up to 27
p.c. True to past form, directors have
decided that publishing the tax provision
at the same time as the profit is giving
too much good news away. For several
years now tax provision has exceeded
net profit. Last year proved the most
conservative of all. Tax provision was
£1,081,000, compared with the profit of
£709,000. Based on this tax provision,
the imputed earning rate was 46 p.c. If
this ratio between stated tax and stated
profit remains constant, this year’s
imputed earning rate is 64 p.c.
If one accepted this as an absolute
figure, and not just a guide, it would be
dangerous. However, it is fair to say
that profits are understated, especially
when compared with other companies.
By buying on Wednesday I’m not only
getting in on the l-for-4 par issue but
also the 8i p.c. dividend. In both cases
books closed on the Friday.
This issue could behave in much the
same way as Cresco. Now that those
Cresco shares after the issue are 6s.
above my purchase price, I’ve more than
forgiven the company.
Because the James Hardie issue is
at par and the shares sell at almost a £7
premium, the issue comes pretty close
to being a bonus one for the average
shareholder. Consequently there should
not be many rights on the market. On
the other hand, there should be a pretty
wide demand, so given time the shares
could rise up to the cum rights price of
£7 15s. again.
Whereas the cost of 200 shares in
James Hardie exceeded £1,500, the out-
lay for the other purchase of the week,
Kay Corporation, was only a little over
£lOO.
Kay Corporation is a relative new-
comer to the Exchange, having been
listed in November, 1962. To those
people flying between Sydney and Mel-
bourne, it is a familiar name with its
“rent a car” service. Kay has also gone
into the leasing of plant. An offshoot
of the main business is a subsidiary that
services the equipment.
From an accounting point of view,
the most important aspect of the business
is depreciation. Last year the deprecia-
tion figure of £200,000 was more than
half the issued capital of £300,000. The
policy of directors is to provide very
heavy depreciation in the first two years.
Consequently, as the company has ex-
panded very rapidly since listing, the
sudden increase in depreciation has
temporarily caused a lower profit.
This will be the case again this year,
but profits should still give a good cover
to the 10 p.c. dividend.
The market seems to have become
confused over this issue. Otherwise I
can find no explanation for the sudden
fall to ss. 9d. In I went with a buying
order for 400 shares.
Selling orders for this week were for
Cresco rights, ODE, Eric White and
Molloy. All showed profits and so were
quite a contrast to some of those ego-
damaging transactions of the last few
months. Eric White led the field with a
net credit of £124. Grouped together,
the profit on the others was £66.
Transactions for the week were:
SOLD
500 Eric White, 21/- £514
200 Molloy, 1/6 £l4
1000 ODE, 6/6 £315
50 Cresco rts, 14/- £34
BOUGHT
200 James Hardie, 155/- £1573
400 Kay Corporation, 5/9 £l2O
That familiar debit makes its appear-
ance in the account again. This time it
stands at £693.

THE MAN
ON THE LAND
Land Settlement Comes in
a New Way
Shire Council's imaginative scheme
\X/Bile most Australians are aware
” that the northern part of the con-
tinent is under-populated, not so many
realise that in the south there are vast
areas of empty land.
One area which is liberally endowed
with fertile soils and a good rainfall (30
inches) is Orbost Shire in south-eastern
Gippsland. Its boundaries are the Snowy
River, the Victoria-NSW border and the
coastline from a point east of Bairnsdale
to Gabo Island.
Gabo Island, a navigation landmark,
gets more mention in the national Press
coverage than does the Shire’s principal
town, Orbost.
Now, the Orbost Shire Council has
undertaken an imaginative land settle-
ment programme. In this it may be
unique. Land settlement usually is in
the hands of State Government depart-
ments or large financial institutions
such as the AMP Society in the former
Ninety Mile Desert.
Obviously the Shire Council of Orbost
hasn't the funds to get a large-scale deve-
lopment under way; but this approach
from the grass-roots has interesting pos-
sibilities. Other local government bodies
throughout Australia may be able to
learn much from the Orbost experiment.
Initially, the Shire Council’s job will
be to find suitable settlers for the more
than 2000 square miles of empty Crown
land within the Shire suitable for dairy-
ing and/or mixed farming.
Other schemes usually begin by throw-
ing open the land and then inviting set-
tlers. What happens is that many en-
thusiastic but quite unsuitable people—•
in terms of finance and experience—•
apply for blocks. If they get blocks they
often leave within a short period.
A ustralia is littered with the remnants
of idealistic land settlement schemes.
With the passage of time the original
blocks become merged with large hold-
ings. All that the original block-holders
accomplish is the initial back-breaking
job of clearing and fencing. The big
landholders who eventually acquire these
blocks often do so at bargain prices.
This sort of thing does not belong
always to the distant past. It is hap-
pening now in some areas developed
since World War 11.
The Orbost idea is to get the settlers
first and then go about surveying and
cutting up the bush.
It is a realistic approach. The Shire
Council president, Councillor C. T. Trus-
cott, says there is no intention to cut up
existing properties (there are some large
ones up near the border across from
Bombala in NSW) or to try to get re-
leased land set aside as forestry pre-
serves. With 3676 square miles and only
7000 people there is plenty of land to
go around.
The aim is 500 farms each of about
400 acres ... as a start. These will be
located near existing townships such as
Goongerah. Cann River, Nowa Nowa,
Wingan and Newmerella. In really re-
mote areas community farm settlements
are a possibility.
What then is a “suitable” settler?
He must, in the first instance, be pre-
pared to go to the Orbost district and
have a look at the country. The Coun-
cil will show him around. He should
know something of farming and, an un-
fortunate fact of life, he should have
some capital.
How much capital? He need not have
it all in cash, but something in the vicin-
ity of £16,000 would be needed to pro-
perly develop an Orbost farm.
The greatest barrier to land develop-
ment in this area is the bush itself. It is
fairly well covered with timber. This
timber would have to be cleared and a
reasonable estimate of the cost is about
£4O an acre.
The new settler could not expect much
in the way of a pasture for about three
years. Therefore, he would need to have
funds to carry him over this period. He
might get a little outside work.
Long-term loans are being sought by
the Shire Council both from the Vic-
torian Government and financial institu-
tions. It is confidently expected that the
Government will stand the cost of survey
of the blocks.
Some settlers’ meetings have already
been held at various localities in the
district and more are planned. Those to
date have been encouraging.
At Goongerah, for example, 20 appli-
cants —all ready and willing and able to
take up blocks—gave details of their
experience, financial position and their
ideas of what they would do with the
land.
The Shire Council has not the power
actually to grant the blocks but its re-
commendations are expected to carry
weight at State Lands Board interviews
which applicants must attend.
While this approach may be hard on
the young chap with plenty of initiative
but no cash, nevertheless it is attuned to
reality. In the old days people were pre-
pared to go out armed with only an axe
and a billycan and make do as best they
could.
We are inclined to look back on those
pioneering days with nostalgia. We
forget that if anyone got sick no medical
aid was at hand and the risk of death
was always present.
The only people who would take this
kind of thing on today are idealists
usually city-bred who have no idea
what they are letting themselves and
their families in for.
rjhiE Orbost idea might well be taken a
step further. What this country needs
is a national approach to land settlement.
What better way than to have many
local settlement committees, in touch
with local requirements and realities,
coming under a national body which
could look after the matters of high
finance?
In one sense this is already happening
with Orbost Shire. East Gippsland is
ear-marked in long-range planning as a
source of the water supply which ex-
panding Melbourne will need. But the
local approach is that the industries and
the people should come to the water.
Meanwhile the anglers and the
campers who love the wildness and un-
touched beauty of this part of southern
Australia have little to fear. Even with
500 new farms within ten years the dis-
trict would remain virtually unspoiled.
It is one of the few coastlines within
fairly easy reach of Melbourne which is
not cluttered with juke-boxes, drive-ins
and motor-car surfies.
Historically this part of Australia is
interesting, too. Just beyond Orbost

Shire, near Eden (NSW), is the site of
Benjamin Boyd’s whaling station estab-
lished some 100 years ago.
Boyd, for some strange reason, usually
appears in most Australian school books
as a kind of rustic with harpoon in one
hand and plough in the other. In fact,
this most polished gentleman adventurer
envisaged Twofold Bay—a fine port—
as the outlet for a hinterland encompass-
ing Bombala and the Monaro country
and what is now Orbost Shire.
It appears that Boyd never really
thought the idea could possibly fail. It
was far more watertight than many of his
other ventures in the wide Pacific. Here
everything was ideal —a wonderful har-
bor, good rainfall and soil, and an excel-
lent climate.
Perhaps one of the reasons it never
got going was the habit our forbears had
of drawing lines on the map—with scant
regard for topography and geography—-
and then designating them as State bor-
ders.
The line on the map made Orbost and
Twofold Bay forgotten outposts—one in
Victoria administered from Spring
Street, Melbourne, and one in NSW run
from Macquarie Street, Sydney.
Way Behind in Agricultural
Extension Work
“Quite big moves ” may soon be expected
T>ausing in Ontario, Canada, during a
world trip, the Minister for Primary
Industry, Mr C. F. Adermann, had
some things to say about agricultural
extension work at home.
To a Canadian interviewer he con-
fessed that Australia was a long way
behind in extension.
We were equal, if not superior, in
basic research, he said. But we had
nothing to compare with the 50
adequately staffed extension centres in
Ontario alone. From this we might
expect to see quite big moves in agri-
cultural extension.
What is extension? Very simply it is
getting the facts of research across to
farmers . . . and, more to the point,
getting farmers to act upon the findings
of research.
In Canada and the United States ex-
tension deals with many facets of farm-
ing. It is sponsored both by Govern-
ment (usually through universities) and
private enterprise.
The private farm adviser (there are
some making an impact in Australia
now) is a professional just like an
accountant or a lawyer.
The North American extension ser-
vices did not evolve overnight. There is
clearly a relationship between the growth
of these services and the increasing
number of farmers who have received
a college education.
Of the many facets of extension, one
which Mr Adermann will be concerned
with is veterinary work. For some
months now there has been much
activity in Australia on this subject and
Mr Adermann would be well informed.
A Dr E. A. Eichorn, of the United
Nations Food and Agriculture Organisa-
tion (FAO), has been here since April
at the invitation of the Commonwealth
Department of Health. His job has been
to review Australia’s preparedness to
combat any serious outbreak of one of
the world’s major exotic animal diseases.
Dr Eichorn is well known for a
successful foot-and-mouth-disease eradi-
cation campaign he directed in Mexico.
He is chief of the animal health division
of FAO.
He said recently in Melbourne that
Australia’s quarantine regulations were
good and, in fact, among the strictest in
the world. Australia had able veterinary
officers but not enough of them.
One of our biggest problems in the
event of a disease outbreak was, he said,
the large numbers of animals in virtually
the wild state: mainly cattle in the
north. If foot and mouth, for example,
got amongst these cattle the only
solution might be to call out the Armed
Forces to shoot them down. These
animals, which could not be controlled
easily, would be a reservoir for disease.
Professor Douglas Blood, dean of the
faculty of Veterinary Science at Mel-
bourne University, has said that there
was scope for improved communications
between veterinarians and farmers. This
communication would be two-way. Not
only did veterinarians teach farmers,
but they gained a lot from thoughtful
questioning, comment and observation
on the part of the farmers.
But if farmers were to look at all the
diseases which could occur with managed
pasture, as distinct from native pasture,
they would be sufficiently frightened to
stick to unimproved pasture.
The diseases Professor Blood was
talking about were not necessarily of the
exotic kind. Some of these diseases,
because of improved pastures, were
developing new strengths.
They included (in cattle): Red nose,
footrot, worms, coccidiosis, pulpy kidney,
bloat and leptospirosis (a form of red-
water).
In sheep they included: Pizzle rot,
footrot, mastitis and pink-eye.
Professor Blood said that most farm-
ers realised, of course, that the increase
in disease risk brought on by improved
pastures was more than compensated for
by improved production. But with
pasture improvement the outbreak of
disease was likely t.o be more dramatic
because of the increased concentration
of livestock on smaller areas.
Farmers, he said, would have to
develop a more scientific attitude to
disease prevention and be prepared to
use all the aids which were available to
them, including Government and private
veterinarians. What was needed badly
was regional diagnostic centres.
Regional diagnostic centres were very
important because many of the major
exotic diseases from which Australia was
free, such as foot and mouth, blue
tongue, rabies, Newcastle disease and
African horse sickness, were virus
diseases. Regional diagnostic centres
could discover them in time.
As it stood now many farmers were
left to their own resources in making a
diagnosis something they were not
equipped to do. They might have an
animal in the early stages and be un-
aware of it.
The seriousness of a major outbreak
of one of the exotic diseases is high-
lighted by what it might cost. An out-
break of foot and mouth would mean
that exports of £540 million a year
would be cut off.
The last big outbreak of foot and
mouth in Canada cost one million dollars
to eradicate and trading losses amounted
to 200 million dollars.
Some farmers might reasonably ask:
“We have kept these things out for a
long time, so why be concerned now?”
Air travel is one good answer to this.
In the past a long ship voyage was a
coincidental quarantine and a very
effective one. With hundreds of air
travellers arriving every day from over-
seas countries some perhaps wearing
shoes they tramped the streets of Cal-
cutta in a few hours previously the
situation is obviously altered.
Some veterinarians go so far as to say
that the reason we have been free for
so long of exotic animal diseases has
been largely luck. They expect a major
disease onslaught soon and, in the world
sense, the situation is perhaps getting
worse and not better.
Many African and Asian countries,
source of many diseases, are much

worse off in veterinary services now
since the departure of the former
colonial powers. As things stand at the
moment we are probably wide open
to an outbreak in Australia.
All the extension centres in Canada
may not contain a veterinary officer,
but many of them do. Those that do
not have a resident vet. are always in
close contact with a regional centre that
does.
The wide area of field extension and
research is closely integrated and com-
munications are an important factor.
It is possible in most North American
universities to do a course in communi-
cations (agricultural communications is
just a part of it).
At the research level we in Australia
have the CSIRO, State Departments of
Agriculture and the many universities.
Extension and communications are
attempted by the Departments of Agri-
culture as best they can (with limited
resources) and usually take the form of
field days.
Valuable as these are, something more
comprehensive is needed, and it would
not surprise if Mr Adermann comes up
with the answer.
Wheat Competition Aids
Standards
the last six years, Mr Alan Wain-
-*■ wright, mill superintendent of
Noske’s Victorian and South Australian
chain of flour mills, has judged Hor-
sham (Vic.) Agricultural Society's in-
creasingly popular wheat and flour qua-
lity competition, which, in 1963, attrac-
ted 66 entries. The marked success of
a competition, regarded by Sydney wheat
judges and trade experts generally as
Australia's most comprehensive of the
kind, led a councillor of Royal Mel-
bourne Show to investigate the possibility
of a similar competition at the 1964
Show.
But what Horsham, concentrating on
its own Wimmera district wheats, has
done could not be so easily repeated in
Melbourne, where wheats from all over
Victoria are entered. This would make
it extremely difficult to mill, bake and
display entries as is done at Horsham,
where the loaves produced are of great
interest to the general public as well as
to wheatgrowers.
Last year, a South Australian wheat
variety new to Victoria, Scimitar, with
a 13.5 per cent protein content, ran
the winning Olympic entry’s 13.56 per
cent of protein very close in the bakers’
flour section, but failed to equal the
Olympic's dough characteristics. The
best of the biscuit flour entries, none
of which came up to the standard of pre-
vious years, was a Pinnacle sample with
over-high protein content (8.6 per cent)
but excellent extensible gluten proper-
ties.
The competition has made very plain
the need to segregate Wimmera wheats,
with their divergent but improving
baking qualities, both as regards variety
and protein content. This can be readily
done at mills, where there are always
experienced employees competent to
make the necessary snap gluten and pro-
tein tests before a farmer unloads his
wheat. But segregation would be in-
finitely more difficult when wheat is de-
livered to the Grain Elevators’ Board, as
so much is, because so few silos have, as
yet, an operator conversant with wheat
quality and wheat testing.
Battling Against
Fallow Drift
Tn the past, when Mallee wheatlands
A had such a serious soil drift pro-
blem, Dimboola (Vic.) Shire Council
passed a by-law under which any land-
holder to the north of a line 12 miles
south of the 36th parallel could be pro-
secuted if he fallowed or burned off
within three chains of a fence abutting
a highway.
Those were the days when the Mallee
was “really moving" and both highways
and fences were, in the continued dry
and windy weather so prevalent in the
Mallee, often buried beneath drift from
fallow, a drift accentuated when burning
off further dried out the sandy soil. Tn
some places drift was persistent enough
to cover two fences, one above the other,
and partly cover a third built on the
same line.
Today, though fallow drift can be
easily controlled by a few hours’ ridging
with a tractor, there are still land-
holders, on rich Wimmera black soil as
well as in the lighter Mallee wheatlands,
who do not check this loss of topsoil,
even though this depletes soil fertility,
buries fences and endangers highways.
As recently as March, 1964, Dimboola
Shire Council was gravely concerned
because drifted sand was three feet deep
on both sides of one Shire road and,
slowly cohering the metal roadway,
threatened to involve the Shire in con-
siderable expense to remove hundreds
of cubic yards of sand.
The Shire could not prosecute one
flagrant offender under the existing, but
almost forgotten, by-law because his
badly drifting fallow was outside the
limits specified in the by-law. Unfor-
tunately, special State legislation, which
would take time, would be necessary to
extend the by-law to cover the whole
Shire.
Nevertheless, Council did what it
could. It notified, both personally and
through the newspapers, all ratepayers
of their liability under the by-law, in an
effort to abate a nuisance seriously
affecting individual landholders as well
as the Shire.
