The sapling
symbolizes every-
body’s child. All
parents desire
their children to
grow strong and
sturdy as the oak,
to weather the
storms as well as
enjoy the sunshine of life.
Children who do not grow
strong from the start require
special feeding, no matter how
good the daily food. The best
special food is Benger’s Food, and
every child who is weakly or
backward, shooting up too rapidly
or failing to make normal growth,
should be given Benger’s extra
to the ordinary meals.
“Mr. B enger’s admirable preparation.” — “THE LANCET.”
Parents interested in this advertisement are invited to read the
more detailed information given in Benger’s Booklet. A copy will
be sent post free on application.
A cup of Benger’s Food between
meals and just before bed-time
has transformed many weakly in-
fants*. To-day, thousands of robust
men and women, fathers and
mothers themselves, are evidence
of the benefits derived from Ben-
ger’s in their growing period.
Adult men and women, in
indisposition, sickness or in health,
can always benefit by Benger’s
Food.
Benger’s is not expensive. Made
with all milk it costs about 6d.
per pint—two dishes—including
the price of the fresh milk. Some
children like the food flavoured
with a piece of chocolate for a
change.

Shaw Neilson’s Third Book
It was Mary Gilmore told me that she
read Shaw Neilson’s early ballad, the strik-
ing “Marion’s Child,” when she was in
Paraguay. That was in the ’nineties; the
ballad was reprinted in “The Bulletin
Reciter” in 1900. Yet Shaw Neilson’s book,
“New Poems,” just published, reads like
the work of a young man. It has the dew
on it.
Neilson’s most constant critic and admirer
has said truly that his poetry is “not said,
but sung; not metrically stated, but poetic-
ally sung.” He is a poet or nothing.
He does not compete with acrobatic versi-
fiers nor with heavy rhyming philosophers.
His poems, with their whims in the use of
symbol and color, are, in Wordsworth’s
phrase, “carried alive into the heart by
passion” (the opposite, I suppose, of being
pushed dead into the mind by argument).
In his earlier books, “The Heart of Spring”
and “Ballad and Lyrical Poems,” Neilson
demanded the whole of us or nothing; the
same demand is made here. You must step
into his world before you can feel it. You
must surrender to the white magic lying in
words that are almost transparent. Neilson
in this is like Chris Brennan; his words
seem to vanish; his songs are “Chansons
Sans Paroles.” And this all comes to us
from a man whose daily work is perforce
the crudest form of manual toil, quarrying
and road-making. He gives us no stony,
hammering metres; his tunes must sing
themselves very far within him, as when he
writes:—■
Let your gong be delicate;
The bees are home,
All their days’ love is sunken
Deep in the comb.
Shaw Neilson’s earlier books, though
neither one is ten years old, are almost hope-
lessly out of print; yet the present book
reprints nothing from them. Anyone com-
ing on this “New Poems” without knowing
its forerunners would be impressed; but
the earlier bulk of Neilson’s work helps
this part of it. We must not forget that he
has long been meditating on his quiet
themes, as in these radiant lines written
long ago:—
Speak not of death; it is a merry morn,
A glittering bird has danced into a tree.
From his abundant heart bravely are borne
The loves of leafy choristers to me.
Music is of the sunlight, strong and free.
The sun is up, and death is far away,
The first hour is the sweetest of the day.
Neilson’s poetry abides in that “first hour”;
I have said the dew is on it. The poems in
this book are like early gossamers spread
over the grass; they have the rare, serene
temper of those hours celebrated in such
dawn-time songs as W. H. Davies’s
When I did wake this morn from sleep.
Fantasies are in the book, like that of
the quaint Green Lover, who met his doom,
but joyfully, for it was at the dawn:—
The Dawn is ever a creepy time;
The Mysteries make it so;
Beauty is broken about the sky
And into the earth below;
Shadows go out, and stars go out,
And the Royal Red comes in.
But it is not fair to quote just a patch from
a fantasy. And it is not fair for me to make
words about Neilson. All one can do is
to act as a sign-post; or a town crier.
There are a few poems in this book, as in
his others, that come as a hard saying, to
me at least. Other readers may find them
easier, but I feel that in “Half a Life Back,”
for instance, Neilson has used certain sym-
bols to which he alone has the key. An
easy thing to do; the poet feels that he
must sing right on and that, because he is
genuine, people must understand. Usually,
indeed, we are intensely grateful to Neilson
for singing right on, as he does so per-
suasively in that strangely rich confession-
meditation, “The Gentle Water-bird.”
It is not necessary, at this date, I imagine,
to say that Neilson knows all about mak-
ing verse and that when his forms are
irregular they are his chosen means of ex-
pression, not an accident. I mention this,
because I have seen someone counting
Neilson’s accents by fourteens or two hand-
fuls of fingers. He is not to be counted in
that way, though if he liked he could turn
you a sonnet with the best. His rhythms
are his own now; they are his slaves. In
this book, take the pungent clearness of
“The Child Being There.” Take, for power,
the rhythm in “The Moon Was Seven Days
Down,” and, for sheer appropriate charm,
the lilt of “The Irish Welcome.” The
beauty in “Out to the Green Fields!” is
tremulous, but sure. It is not too long to
quote:—
Here there is crying, cruelty, every tone;
Cruel is iron, and where is the pity in stone?
The ancient tyrannies tower, they cannot yield:
Let the tired eyes go to the green field!
Flowers are foreigners here, subdued and calm,
Standing as children under a heavy psalm;
My heart is ever impatient of standing so;
Out to the green fields the tired eyes go.
Out where the grasses hasten the resolute heart of
man!
Out to the place of pity where all his tears began!
Only down with the' young love are the fairy
folk concealed.
Let the tired eyes go to the green field!
The leaves have listened to all the birds so long;
Every ' blossom has ridden out Of song;
Only low with the young love the older hates are
healed ;
Let the tired eyes go to the green field!
In truth, Shaw Neilson’s song is delicate,
but it is time for this delicate singer to be
proclaimed as part of our heritage.
NETTIE PALMER.
The Blind
Braille is a wonderful juggling with six
dots and the development of it is more
marvellous even than Gerald Dillon
suggested in his absorbing article on
“What the Blind Read” (R.P, 17/11/’27).
There are now three grades of Braille.
One and two are in general use; grade
three corresponds to the shorthand of
sighted folk and is used mainly by blind
typists. Before the present Braille machine
was perfected the writing was done on a
frame. This meant transposing the dots
when writing in much the same way as type
is arranged for printing. The latest machines
do the transposing, so that the writer does
not have to remember one set of dots for
reading and another set for writing.
It is a great deal more difficult to explain
things to a child who has never had sight
than to one who has had sight for a few
years; and although the blind children of
Maoriland are usually sent to the Jubilee
Institute for the Blind in Auckland much
later than a sighted child enters a school,
once they have mastered the alphabet they
learn to read more quickly and with far
more expression than does the average
sighted child. Noise is the only thing which
easily distracts their attention.
One great trouble that blind people have
to contend with is poor health. In past
generations very few sightless ones were
able to walk without a companion to guide
them; consequently the amount of exercise
they took depended on the kind of friends
and relations they possessed. The blind
generation which is growing up now is being
made more self-reliant. The children at the
institute have exercises and games and are
taught to swim just like sighted children,
and some blind men are good scullers.
It is a strange thing that if a person goes
blind after he has known how to write with
pen and ink, and is forced to write in
Braille, in nine cases out of ten he forgets
how to even sign his name; and when he
does sign he loses all sense of direction and
writes one letter on the top of another, with
unreadable results. Some blind people re-
tain their remembrance of the written alpha-
bet, but they are few and far between.
Here in Maoriland the names and
addresses of all blind people are kept by the
Red Cross Society, and gatherings are held
for them during the year. At Christmas
time they all receive a parcel, and the Direc-
tor of the Institute, Clutha Mackenzie, him-
self blind, pays a visit to every chief centre
once a year, when everyone who has a
grievance can air it.
HINEMOA.
Poetry at the Climacteric
L, Phillips, who foretells the death of
English poetry in the last banal breath of
Humbert Wolfe’s satire (R.P, 24/11/’27),
at least admits that its heart is still beating,
although with less vigor, perhaps, than it
had half a century ago. Yet, as every
clinician knows, it is dangerous to diagnose
the approach of death merely on appear-
ances; and it is possible that L. Phillips
has mistaken a temporary cataleptic state
of English poetry for the signs of imminent
death, and has written out the burial cer-
tificate in advance and ordered a wreath
accordingly. At any rate, the clinician in
question is satisfied that the quietus of
English poetry is at hand, and has nomi-
nated “Hugh McCrae, Kenneth Slessor and
Robert D. Fitz Gerald and a dozen others”
as pall-bearers, and has charged them each
and severally with carrying on the work
of the “gigantic Elizabethans.”
This certainly sounds rather a tall order
—to ask Hugh McCrae and Company, after
burying the contemporary corpse of Eng-
lish poetry, to step into the shoes of Mar-
lowe, Herrick and Milton. I should say
that there is nothing more cramping to a
man’s style than having a reputation to
live up to; and when that reputation hap-
pens to be that which once belonged to
England’s foremost .poets, it is almost
enough to induce a state of catatonic stupor.
Swinburne by the very pagan and revo-
lutionary nature of his f'Poems and Bal-
lades” acquired a big reputation early in
life, and the bigger this grew the more
second-rate his poetry became; whereas
Browning, who never achieved a decent
recognition during life, continued to write
first-class poetry. If Keats were resurrected
to-day it is doubtful whether he could live
up to his reputation as a singer. Brooke,
if suddenly brought back to ’life, would
almost certainly sink to the level of a
second-rate poet; for a reputation is like
a millstone round one’s neck. It has
drowned most of our laureates in the past;
and many a promising poet has perished in
trying to write up to the reputation which
has been literally thrust upo,n him in youth.
There is undeniable excellence in the
work of Hugh McCrae; a pagan lyricism
is woven through his rhymes, and he com-
mands a technical ease which makes his
best verse vibrant with subtle music. Nor
is the work of some of his contemporaries
less important and beautiful. I am not
going to deny that they may add a new
lustre to song, and achieve a share of the
immortality of great poets. But why
saddle them with “the saving of English

verse”? English verse may not need sav-
ing, nor even rejuvenating by a poetical
Steinach. It may simply be passing through
one of those apparently sterile periods of
its growth. Such a period existed in the
early eighteenth century, when, from the
death of Drvden in 1700 until Blake and
Burns commenced to sing some 70 or 80
years later, there appeared—with the pos-
sible exception of Thomas Gray and Oliver
Goldsmith—no first-rate poet. I am aware
that Matthew Prior and Thomas Tickle
and Henry Carey and Richard Glover were
writing verse during this period. I am
aware also that Alexander Pope penned most
of his rhymed couplets in the first half of
the eighteenth century, and that John
Home, who now rests in obscurity, was at
that time compared with Shakspeare. But
the age generally is noted for its poetic
second-ratedness; and it would be easy to
understand a critic at that time, having read
the works of Annie Finch, Elizabeth Carter,
Erasmus Darwin and James Beattie, say-
ing that English poetry had developed a
death'rattle and was ready to pass out.
But I cannot see in contemporary English
poetry that mental and physical decrepitude
which invariably presages death. I can
see no death-sweat; and even with my
stethoscope on the Sitwells, I am unable
to detect the death-rattle in the poetry of
to-day. I would say rather that the pre-
sent diagnosis of poetry pointed more to-
wards the climacteric than in the direction
of death. Change seems to be the charac-
teristic feature of modern verse. The old
verse forms (like the old art forms) have
yielded to the full their rich vintage.
Modern poets are searching for and experi-
menting with the new. Not all their efforts
are successful; many are feeble—even
foolish and grotesque. But they point the
way, as Chatterton pointed the way to
Shelley and Keats. Poets who live in
rooms with a central heating system and a
wireless receiving set, and have their names
inscribed in the telephone directory, can-
not write like Marlowe. Poets who fought
in France and now compose on a typewriter
under electric light cannot write with the
same faith which inspired Milton. This is
an age of Cinemas and Slogans, of Psycho-
analysis and Sex Hygiene. Keats wrote
of that which
Charmed magic casements, opening on the foam
Of perilous seas, in faery lands forlorn.
But after the passage of a century and the
advent of Darwin, Marconi, Einstein and
Freud, the modern poet sings:—
They are rattling breakfast plates in basement
kitchens,
And along the trampled edges of the street
I am aware of the damp souls of housemaids
Sprouting despondently at area gates.
The change was inevitable.
There are two classes of poets writing to-
day: the imitators and the innovators. The
former—those who write as well as they can
in the manner of the Old Masters—often
appear the more successful. But the latter,
though frequently discordant and perverse,
are the more important. We may gibe at
their poems, their free-verse and their un-
rhymed cadence (the critics once jeered at
Keats and neglected Browning); but it is
their genius that is helping English poetry
to pass through its present climacteric. Such
a period is naturally fraught with turpitude
and anxiety, with hectic flushes and periods
of despondency; but these are the signs
of change, not the symptoms of approach-
ing death.
REG. S. ELLERY.
Lachlan Macquarie’s Journals
There are many treasures in the Mitchell
Library which, unless enlightenment over-
takes the Government of N. S. Wales,
will never get into type. It may be that
some day a publisher will arise who will
undertake, at a loss, to print, for instance,
Macquarie’s Journals. But as publishers
depend on book sales for a living, it is
hardly likely that Private Enterprise will
ever do the complete job. Nevertheless
several of the journals might well be pub-
lished by the Government Printer for the
sake of Young Australia in the schools. Such
is the diary he kept of his voyage to Port
Macquarie in 1821—his “Journal of the Tour
to the Northern Settlements in Novem-
ber, 1821.” It gives an excellent insight
into the character of the man as he was—
and especially as he was at a time when,
harassed by nearly a dozen years of strenu-
ous and often thankless labor in developing
the country, he was about to be recalled.
It was on his way back to Sydney that he
first received the news of his supersession
by Sir Thomas Brisbane. Moreover, it
gives us Macquarie in the last years of his
useful life. He died in London in 1824.
The journal of this trip to Port Mac-
quarie is written in the tall, womanish
handwriting that is characteristic of all his
papers, and is kept with the careful minute-
ness that distinguishes the other journals.
The first entry is dated Thursday, Novem-
ber 1, 1821:
Having for some time back resolved on going on
a Tour of Inspection to the New Penal Settlement
of Port Macquarie, and also to that of Newcastle on
my way back from the former, and every necessary
arrangement having been previously made for this
purpose, I took leave of Mrs. M. and our beloved
Boy at 2 o’clock this afternoon ( —they being both
at Sydney at present—) and embarked "on board the
Government Brig Elizabeth Henrietta [named after
Mrs. Macquarie], commanded by Mr. Gray,
accompanied by Lieutenant Macquarie, A.D.C. This
nephew], Mr. Meehan D’y Surveyor Gen’l, Mr.
Nicholson Master Attendant, and Lieut. Robt. John-
ston, R.N., the two latter gentlemen having volun-
teered to be of my Party. The Snapper Cutter, com-
manded by Mr. Fish, accompanied us as a
tender.
There were three Macquaries on the brig
—the Governor, the A.D.C. and a humbler
individual, who was, no doubt, a member
of the clan. ‘‘Joseph the Coachman, Mar-
tin, the as't Cook, Hammond and Corp 1
Macquarie, formed my Establishment ol
Servants on this occasion, besides Five Men
of my own Barge’s crew.”
Few who encountered Macquarie in his
wrath could have imagined that he was
capable of writing in this fashion about his
wife:—
On going on board the Elizabeth Henrietta in
the Cove, I could not help being greatly struck, and
highly pleased with the excellent order, extreme neat-
ness, and judicious arrangement made for my accom-
modation and comfort in every respect. For all this,
as usual, I am indebted to my dear Mrs. M., who
had, unknown to me, gone on board and given
directions for all these comfortable arrangemen.s
being made some days before.
At daylight on the following morning they
were off Port Stephens, and on Saturday
at 10 a.m. they were able to make out the
buildings at Port Macquarie through their
glasses; but. it was not until early in the
following afternoon that the Governor
could get ashore in the pilot’s whaleboat.
The cutter crossed the bar at 2 p.m., and
the brig at 4 o’clock. Here is Macquarie’s
own account of his landing:—
We put oif from the Cutter at 9 o’clock attended
by the Pilot to convey us in Safety over the Bar
into the Port. We arrived at the outside of the
Bar at 4 past 11, when the Pilot made a signal for
his own Whale Boat; our own Boat not being con-
sidered safe to cross it. This took about Half an
Hour to arrange. We then removed to the Whale
Boat, got quite easy and safe across the Bar, and
landed at the Settlement of Port Macquarie at half-
past 12 o’clock; Captain Allman the Commandant
receiving us at the landing Place at the Head of his
Company, which was drawn up under Arms on the
Beach; the Convicts, with their Supdt. at their
Head, being also drawn up on the Beach a little
distance to the left of the Troops, to receive us, and
on my stepping out of the Boat on shore gave me
three Cheers. We proceeded from the landing Place
immediately to the Commandant's House, where Mrs.
Allman, with her family of Children, was ready to
receive and give us a Hearty friendly welcome, in a
very comfortable neat Cottage.
There is not space here to go into detail
as to the four days which were spent at
Port Macquarie; but, as might have been
expected, they were four very strenuous days
for all concerned. With his characteristic
energy, Macquarie seems to have gone
everywhere and seen all that was to be
seen. He writes of his doings with the
utmost minuteness and care, describes every
condition in the settlement, and takes the
greatest pains to be correct in all the
measurements he records. Early on the
morning of the Bth they attempted to take
their departure, but it was not until Sun-
day, the 11th, after many adventures, and
considerable risk of shipwreck, that they
were able to get to sea. They had a very
rough passage down the coast to Port Hun-
ter, where they did not arrive until the
evening of the 14th: —-
At Sunset we could see the Settlement of New-
castle, and the light soon afterwards, Nobby Island
being distinctly seen before it became dark. At 9
p.m. we anchored in Newcastle Harbour. Before we
came to anchor, my old friend and acquaintance
Major Morisset the Comdt. came on board to wait
on me, and delivered me some letters from Sydney;
one of which was from my dearest Mrs. M. —
which was the only one of them that I then read —
and was rejoiced to find all was well.
They went up the river next day in
Major Morisset’s famous barge—from
whose bows it is to be presumed that on
this occasion the triangles were missing—
and reached Wallis Plains, where West
Maitland was subsequently founded. They
spent the night there, and from the follow-
ing extract one would almost infer that the
Major could be something besides a mar-
tinet: “At half-past 4 p.m. we arrived at
the Government Cottage, which Major
Morisset had built some time since, and
very kindly called it Lachlan Cottage in
honor of his young friend Lachlan, our
beloved Boy.” Later:—
Here I found Bungaree, Chief of the Boan Native
Tribe, with all his own Family, and 30 more of his
Tribe, waiting my arrival, having come on purpose
to meet me.... Bungaree and his Tribe entertained
us with a Karaburie after Dinner, and we did not go
to Bed till 11 o’clock.
The Governor was delayed by the weather
from leaving for Sydney on the 17th, as he
had intended, until early on the 20th. In
the meantime, as usual, he inspected every-
thing he could think of—the harbor, the
gaol, the barracks, all sorts of convicts,
two new windmills, the breakwater building
out to Nobby’s, and a score of things
beside, all of which are scrupulously de-
scribed in the journal. When at length
he departed, the Major must have felt a
little relieved, even though he did not for-
get to send young Lachlan Macquarie “the
following very handsome Present of Pets,
viz., Four Black Swans, two Emus, two
Kangaroos (Foresters), One Wild Goose
and one Wanga Wanga Pigeon.” A
thoughtful fellow, the late Major Morisset 1
At 12 at Noon, we entered the Heads of Port
Jackson —and the wind being directly fair ran up
the Harbour in the Brig. We anchored at 1 p.m.
and landed immediately at Mrs. M.’s Private Stairs,
where I had the happiness of meeting my dearest
Elizabeth- —our Darling Boy being at Mr. Reddall’s.

Novels Worth Reading
This list has been compiled by a com-
mittee nominated by the Associated Book-
sellers of Australia and Maoriland to serve
as a reliable guide to fiction of merit:—
Bool'S of Literary Merit. —-Jew Suss, by
Lion Feuehtwanger; Julius Levine, by “A

A Satchel of Books
The Madonna of the Clutching Hands, by
Christine Jope-Slade (Nisbet). Has a quiet
humor and a delicate art of dissection.
Wolf Song, by Harvey Fergusson (Knopf:
Robertson and Mullens). A Wild West yarn,
but a superior example.
Coane’s Australasian Roads (Robertson
and Mullens). This monumental work is a
credit to Australian publishing. Its two
authors have died since the first edition was
issued, and it has been revised by B. M.
Coutie, the city engineer of Malvern (Vic.).
That there was need for such a work is
shown by the fact that, the first edition
having gone out of print, second-hand copies
changed owners at five times the published
price.
Shot on the Downs, by Victor L. Wliito-
church (Fisher Unwin). “Then came the
finding of the two violets —the most impor-
tant clue of all.” The author in a few pre-
fatory lines discloses a method of construc-
tion in this class of story that is interesting.
He set out without plan—declares that he
had no idea of plot or criminal when he put
pen to the first chapter. Up to a point this
suggests an art of successful concealment,
for what is as yet unknown to the writer
cannot be revealed to the reader.
Anderson's Jo, by Mary Grant Bruce
(.Cornstalk Co.). Tasmania and Gippsland,
tw T o picture spots on the map of Australia,
have been chosen by this writer of healthy
fiction for young folk as the scene for her
latest novel—in time for the gift-giving
Christmas season. The vagrant god of cir-
cumstance thrust upon lonely John Ander-
son the burden of up-bringing _the little dere-
lict, Jo Wilson, bereft of her mother and
without known kin. How John shouldered
his burden makes a story of mingled mirth
and pathos.
An Unofficial Rose, by Mary Marlowe (Col-
lins ; Robertson and Mullens). Miss Marlowe
has had a varied experience. Belonging to
an old squatting family back of Bourke, she
has travelled much, been on the stage, war-
nursed and is now on the staff of the Sydney
Sun. Her latest book —a previous brace have
had considerable success —gives a distinctly
good impression. It moves with great ease
and nonchalance amongst the English aris-
tocracy and with equal decision paints the
raw voluptuousness of a “pommy” servant-
girl who isn’t sure whether her child’s pater-
nity is to be credited to the grocer or the
iceman. (This same irregular baby is the
unusual heroine of the story, which leaps from
Australia to England and back again.) Miss
Marlowe writes vividly, and has sympathy
and understanding; but one gets the notion
that she is as yet a trifle embarrassed with
the wealth of her raw material. She shows
an eagerness sometimes to impart informa-
tion when the business in hand is the more
exacting one of painting life’s portrait. But
her craftmanship is steadily improving.
Mag It Please Your Honor! by Wilfred
Blacket, K.C. (Cornstalk Co.). Such books
as this have by reason of their human
interest an attraction extending far beyond
the professional circle. Mr. Blacket’s volume
deals with the lawyers and law courts of
N. S. Wales in days which are not so remote
as to have passed beyond living memory.
As its author states, it is intended not as a
book of formal biographies, but as a genial
record of such sayings and happenings as
may be counted worthy of being kept in
remembrance by reason of their wit, their
bite, or their wisdom. With the art of the
practised journalist—Mr. Blaeket was on
the staff of The Bulletin before lie began
to practise at the Bar—he handles his mat-
ter so deftly as to convey a sense of con-
tinuity to disjointed matter. It is a most
amusing and, within its own sphere, a most
interesting collection of good sayings and
crisp anecdotes, and should attract a wide
circle of readers.
Australia, Tasmania and New Zealand
from Earliest Times, by J. Grattan Grey
(Fraser and Jenkinson). A residence by its
author of 64 years in Australasia, most of
the period spent in newspaper offices and Par-
liamentary press galleries—a service broken
only by travel in foreign lands—gives ad-
equate assurance that this lucid and well-
compiled volume has none of the superficial
qualities of the literary bird-of-passage. It
covers a wide range, from the period of early
navigation in Southern seas to the establish-
ment of Australia’s seat of government in
Canberra. And Mr. Grey succeeds in making
his history as readable as it is informative.
He does not trouble the reader with any dull
recital of geographical situations nor over-
load his pages with tabulated statistics, but
endeavors to present to him such broad facts,
issues and e/ants as will secure a true
insight into the conditions of things as they
were and as they are. Nor does the author
confine himself to a mere recital of facts,
but freely expresses his own views on certain
aspects of our political and social life.
With these views the reader may or may
not always agree, but they claim the respect
due to a wide and penetrative knowledge of
Australasian conditions.
Bismarck, by Emil Ludwig (Allen and
Unwin). This “story of a fighter” has been
translated from the German text by Eden
and Cedar Paul, and is well illustrated.
It is don. 2 with German thoroughness by a
skilled biographer who seeks for character
beneath the trappings of his subject. “After
30 years,” says Ludwig in a concluding pas-
sage, “the Germans stand beside Bismarck's
grave and lower their flags to salute him.
So simple and strong was his work that it
has outlasted the fulfilment of the master-
builder’s own prophecy. All the German
princes, those upon whom he had founded
the empire, vanished. .. . Nevertheless the
empire held together, amid all the tempta-
tions of Europe. These tribes whose opinion
was never asked, the German people whose
assent was regarded as superfluous, though
disunited for a thousand years held together
amid the earthquakes of the Great War, and
survived the break-up of traditional forms.
The unity of Germany did not depart with
the sovereign rulers. Germany lives! The
German princes forsook her in her bitter
need; but the German people, whose sterling
qualities Bismarck recognised too late, was
steadfast, and saved Bismarck’s work from
destruction.”

VARIOUS VERSE
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
An Old House.
W hensver I walk through an old house and
the dusk is drifting slow,
-Then the ghosts of the dead, unbidden rise
out of the Past and go
1 o the rooms where their dreams lie hidden
—strange dreams that the lone dead
know.
i hey go to a place of shadows where their
dreams lie buried deep
Neath the dust of all things forsaken, that
Love and the long years keep.
But they will not stir or awaken, or sigh
for the dead that weep.
Whenever I walk through an old house and
r the wind is in the eaves,
1 hen the voice of the dead comes sighing, a
murmur of falling leaves
In a garden where Day is dying, and only
the grey Night grieves.
They whisper of things forgotten in the hush
of silent years,
Of a passionate hate enthroning dead Love
and its haunting fears.
’Tis only the lone wind moaning like a soft
voice filled with tears.
W henever I walk through an old house and
the rain is thin and cold,
Then the years, like a dead love calling, rise
up from the moss-grown mould;
lis the mist when the night is falling, and
the rain is thin and cold.

The Doorstep.
Beyond the broad stone sill the children play,
While all about the cool green vine-leaves
lace,
Linking their hands together, that the day
May feel their gentle fingers ward her face •
And so the hot blue sky is only seen
A broken sapphire lake in fields of green.
Where idle winds provoke the tilted palm
Ot each young clear-veined leaf, the sun-
light drips
Spilling in spangled pools upon the calm
Of grey-flagged floor; and little thistle-
ships
Come sailing down a golden-moted sea,
And sparrows chirp, and bees hum droningly.
Here may I sit and snatch a moment’s ease.
Cheating some household task of drudgery,
Hearing afar Pan’s piping, shell the peas,
Or soothe the small hot urchins at mv
knee. J |
Here after school comes Six Years, oh so
wise,
With all a world of learning in her eyes !
The worn old step invites my Babe to drink
His brimming mug of milk; lie takes his
seat,
Clutching the pictured beaker, eyes a-blink
With laughter as he patters naked feet,
Cuddling m hollowed comfort on the stone,
Crooning some shy sweet sing-song of his
own.
Beyond the little vine-walled porch the world
Slips by perforce unheeded. Here Life's
stream
Is narrowed down to Duty ; wings are furled •
Yet may I sit at dawn and dusk and
dream.
Sipping, content, my leisure like a wine,
-c eelmg my soul reach upward as the vine.
Here may I brood a moment ere the day
c f^ er n° rse less binds the yoke about my neck
Still lingers night beneath the leaves, and
they
Enjoin with her to hold the day in check.
Comes one who knows my weakness, brings
me tea,
And, loving, shares my doorstep peace with
me.

In a Blue Moon.
Where silver star-buds open, in spacious
holds of grey,
The hills have laid aside the shimmering
garments of the day.
The night has drained the afterglow from
her deep bowl of jade,
And blue the shadow r y moonshine falls along
the myrtle glade.
There s magic in the moon to-night: blown
hon-gy of the dusk
Goes drifting down the leafy walls of sassa-
fras and musk;
And surely Merlin went this way ere yet
bold Vivien
In toils of treachery banished him from
haunts of living men.
So soundly shall I sleep to-night, I shall
not wake to pain;
My heart shall be a garden blowing golden
after rain.
So far the storms had scattered them, by
reef and wind-whipped foam,
That almost had I ceased to hope my ships
were coming home.
I scarcely dreamed they would return on
this or any tide;
But now, with cold eyes kindlier grown, stern
Fate has stepped aside
A little space that you and I may grasp
the elusive boon
And walk the heights of happiness—just
once in a blue moon.

Motherhood.
I have missed many things in life,
But in the tale of ill and good
One joy exceeds all joys and griefs—
And I thank God for motherhood.
W hat does she know of living, she
\\ hose spirit has not knelt apart
In awe before the mystery
Of stirring life beneath her heart;
Who lias not, drowning in its depths,
Still counted every pang well worth
Of the ecstatic agony
Which brings a new soul to the birth;
Nor knows, in that exalted flood
Of mystic love and rapture wild,
I he paean of a mother-heart
As mother-arms enfold her child?
I triumph o’er my dead desires,
Dor I have gained life’s greatest good
And found, with fleshly sacrifice,
The glory of my womanhood.
And from a consecrated stall
A Mother with a Babe divine
Leans down across the centuries
And links her blessedness with mine.

The Courtesan.
Beyond the town wall sweeps the desert sand,
A languorous moon climbs high and rides a
cloud,
And far above the dim, sweet purple land
Ihe gold stars crowd.
The scent of pomegranates, grapes and musk,
ihe gleam of porphyry and jade ; and light
-\ly arm beneath your fair head in the dusk,
Wooing the soft night.
Behind each light that glimmers to the south
lute breathes, love stirs, and lovers are
confest;
But here life means your mouth upon my
mouth,
And that is best.
K every kiss were but a prayer, I’d climb
-\m • 6 balconies °f Heaven, and there see
W lute saints go walking in the summer-time,
A dream, a mystery.
ri ml s tlle . Courtesan am I; the rest
The wide world knows not, cares not,.
Shadows creep;
Ind I, your yellow head upon my breast
Drift into sleep.

The Whelans.
As we left their quaint old farmhouse
Roofed with iron, built of wood—-
W ood made grey by age and weather—
With Phil Whelan on the threshold
Whelan’s wife and daughter stood.
For a space we had foregathered,
And the time had come to part
With a farewell of words only—-
W ords that stumbled in the saying
Of what dwelt within the heart.
Well we knew that we might journey
Many, many days and miles
Ere we chanced on liousefolk like them,
With their kindness and good-nature,
And their pleasantries and smiles.
We had packed our few belongings—
Few, in truth, they were to pack—
And we took some trifles with us
Just as keepsakes, to remember
Whelan’s farmhouse by the track.
Trifles were they, and yet treasures
Such as gold can never buy—
Goodly moments, happy moments,
Glowing moments by a fireside,
When the flames leapt red and high.
Grey was Whelan, grey his wife was;
But a rose upon its stem.
Rich and radiant, sweet and shapely,
Was their tall and winsome daughter,
As we said good-bye to them.
Green and glowing was the valley
Domed by soft and cloudless skies,
As they gave us heart-warm farewell
With a “Good luck” softly spoken,
And a “God-speed” in their eyes,
Oh, who has not met the Whelans,
Or the like of them, has missed
Much to treasure; for I’m thinking
There’s a blessing on the country
Where such kindly folk exist.

World’s End.
I am come to the world’s end.
Now is no more questing,
No blue morning weather.
Bitter grows Time’s jesting.
I am come to the world’s end
And a lamp in a dim shrine burning.
No more shall the strange road lure me!
Ever turning and turning.
I am come to the world’s end.
Yet the mist and the dark are thinnin°-
And I smile, for I know that a world’s °end
Is ever a world’s beginning.

THE BOLSHIE’S HAPPY CHRISTMAS.
“In an interview, Trotsky said the dictatorship of the proletariat had degenerated into the personal regime of a ruling clique, which deprived the workers of
freedom of speech and assembly. Russian workmen who had defended the revolution on the barricades were compelled to work 10 hours a day for a miserable pittance."
THE LEADER OF THE DEPUTATION: “We’re all equal now, aren’t we? So we can all get the same-sized slice?”
THE MAN WHO CUTS THE PUDDING: “Oh yes, quite, quite! But, of course, my military friends here must have the pieces with the sixpences in them."

DEFENCE, NOT DEFIANCE.
Lieut-General Sir Tom Bridges has been
associated with Australians in some very-
important events of his life since 1900, when
he was appointed to command the West-
ralian Mounted Infantry in S’Africa. And
he spoke like a good Australian on a sub-
ject vitally important to the Commonwealth
in taking leave of the Government and
Parliament of South Aus., where he has
been Governor since 1922: —
“With a far outpost of the Empire the
only sane attitude is that of a strong man
armed guarding his castle. In the late war
we had a very good ally in the Pacific, but
to-day Australia stands alone in these seas,
and if the mother country had her hands full
—-which is not inconceivable—Australia
would have to look after herself. For that
reason it would be quite advisable to develop
our own resources in the matter of defence.
We should be able to build our own ships,
make our own guns, our munitions, make our
aeroplanes and motor-ears. No one can tell
what might happen.”
The position is admirably stated, and the
advice is sound. Australia ought to be
making all the things mentioned by its
good friend, who is also an authority—and,
incidentally, employing thousands of men
and women in the making of them, instead
of devising sand-shifting schemes and the
like for unemployed relief. It ought to be
in a position to furnish all its war
materials in the event of its being isolated
by an enemy. And it ought to be giving
all its able-bodied lads, over and above
those who go into the Navy or the Air
Force, a sound military training. In actual
fact, the country which should be building
its own ships is wrestling with the construc-
tion of one seaplane carrier; its output of
guns and munitions was valued at £109,300
in the latest year for which the Munitions
Supply Board gives particulars (there was
£434 worth of ordnance and £lB worth of
gun ammunition); and only three of the
seven Citizen Force quotas are being
trained.

The expenditure on the Australian mili-
tary forces amounted to £2,356,000 in 1913-
14, when the population was 25 p.c. less
than it is to-day and everything the Army
needed to buy was a great deal cheaper.
Last year—the fifth of the “economy”
period—the Army vote got down to
£1,526,000. On June 30, 1913, there were
2774 men on the permanent staff. On
August 1, 1926 (the “Official Year Book”
gives no later figures), the permanent staff
numbered 1750. The results of this star-
vation policy in every branch of the service
have been faithfully recorded by Inspector-
General Chauvel. His reports on the sub-
ject are strikingly suggestive of the pre-
war utterances of Lord Roberts, “who
pleaded in the market-place—pleaded, and
was not heard.” They have had no appa-
rent effect on members of the House of
Reps., but some of the Senators, notably
Sampson (Tas.) and Duncan (N.S.W.), are
not unheeding or silent. Sampson, who
has served in two wars, dealt impressively
with the fool-notion that there is no need
to worry about the shortage of officers since
the supply of A.I.F. veterans would suffice
for all emergencies:—
“It is a long time now since the war.
Those of us who served in the A.I.F. are
not nearly so good to-day as we were then.
For my own part, I think that if I heard a
shell coming I would ‘go for my life.’ I
doubt if my nerves would permit me to stand
up to the strain. When I returned from the
hist war I was little better than a decrepit
old man, and was more or less a nervous
wreck for a couple of years. Since there
are many more in my position, it is probable
that Ave shall be depending upon a broken
reed if we look to the reserve of the A.I.F.
officers and men to pull this country through
another war.”
And. this is apart from the tragic fact
that, thousands of A.I.F. men have gone
under to war-caused maladies Avhich had
not, developed or were not regarded as
serious Avhen theA r returned home.
* * * $
The Senator from Tasmania is strongly
in fa\ r or of “reopening many of the military
training centres that have been closed for
some years” and “extending the time of
training.” He reports that the great majority
of the youths aaLo come under his observa-
tion as a Citizen Force officer “accept train-
ing quite cheerfully,” and that many of them
are remarkably keen. This spirit should be
encouraged by the GoA r ernment, and it could
be encouraged in various Avays. For a
good deal less than is being squandered on
the Federal-aid roads, army posts could be
established and manceuA'res carried out in
interesting and strategically important parts
of North Australia, and sections of the
forces, at least, could be transported from
the south by aeroplane, motor-car and
motor-cycle. Such measures would be im-
mensely attractive to the adventurous young
manhood of Australia, and the North Avould
certainly get a splendid type of settler —
not necessarily a settler on the land—as a
result. But the politicians have no imagi-
nation in these matters. If they had, they
Avouldn’t have let the Army go to pot.
A PLEA FOR PREMIUM BONDS.
Sir Clement Kinlock-Cook, M.P. for
Devonport, founder of the Empire Review
and author of a book on Australian De-
fence, is one of a considerable body of
British politicians who believe in premium
bonds. In association with other Baldwin-
ites he brought up the subject in the House
of Commons recently, suggesting that
Britain should resort to a way of getting
money which has been adopted with advan-
tage in many parts of Europe. “By this
means,” he said, “the Government would
encourage thrift among a large section of
the community which hitherto has not re-
garded the conditions governing invest-
ments as sufficiently attractive, and at the
same time offer further opportunity for all
citizens to possess a direct interest in the
funds of the State.” The Ministerial reply
was unfavorable, as previous Ministerial
replies have been. The Government on
this occasion gave no reasons for its hos-
tility, but, judging by past references, one
of its reasons is that it can get all the
money it requires without offending the
Nonconformist conscience, as premium
bonds would do. And no doubt it con-
siders that premium-bond issues might inter-
fere with the success of ordinary interest-
bearing loans, on which it would still have
to rely for the great bulk of its requirements.
* * * -t
Whether this is right or wrong need
not be discussed here. Even if it is right
as regards Britain it does not follow that
premium bonds would not be a very good
thing for Australia. The circumstances
which have influenced the British Govern-
ment against them do not exist in this
country. We have no large class of inves-
tors with huge oversea interests such as
Britain possesses. We go abroad for most
of our borrowings, necessary and unneces-
sary, and of late we have received some
very plain hints that we are overdoing the
business. Floating a loan in the Common-
wealth is usually a long-drawn-out opera-
tion, the body of investors being small and
not particularly rich. Yet there is always
plenty of money for various silly forms of
gambling. According to a Yic. Labor Min-
ister’s estimate, £2,000,000 was wagered on
Sydney racecourses, and £1,500,000 on Mel-
bourne racecourses, in one year. Probably
half as much again was speculated in start-
ing-price shops and so forth.
hf *«• >|t
If the Commonwealth could get the use
of part of the money thus played up in all
the States, so much of which is wasted in
fattening a horde of bookmakers, it would
be a good thing for both general public and
individual punter. Move especially as un-
successful gamblers are apt to go bankrupt
and to get into prison, and in the latter
case to leave their families to be maintained
by the State. It seems probable that the
thing could be done by making £5 premium
bonds available. The experiment is worth
trying, anyway. A Commonwealth issue of
£2,000,000 or £3,000,000 at, say, 4 p.c., re-
placing a dearer war loan, might be offered
for a start. One and a half per cent, could
be set apart for interest payable annually,
and 2£ per cent, applied to the periodical
redemption of bonds with rich prizes added
—prizes far richer than the average punter
can ever hope to win on the racecourse.
Provision might be made for the purchase
of bonds by instalments and for monthly—
or even fortnightly—drawings. If this alter-
native existed many people who lose more
than they can afford on horses, ponies or
dogs, or all three, would very probably be
cured of the dangerous habit. Premium
bonds would particularly appeal to, and have
a steadying influence on, the very large
number of young fellows who (partly be-
cause they are, very unwisely, exempted
from income-tax) have little or no sense
of responsibility to Commonwealth or State.
It is desirable for many reasons—industrial,
among others—to. get young men of this
type interested in Government securities,
even if their investments should have a
speculative side.
THE TANGLE CALLED LAW.
The long-needed abolition of the absurd,
antiquated, cumbrous and expensive
methods of administering justice in N. S.
Wales, and more particularly in the Supreme
Court, has received fresh emphasis from
the remarks and inconclusive decision of
the Judges of the High Court in the Equity
Appeal case of David Jones and Co., Ltd., v.
Leventhal and others. With the merits
or demerits of that much-litigated contest
The Bulletin, I suppose, is not concerned;
but from all appearances the case will go
back to the Supreme Court, sitting at Com-
mon Law, where it originated, and from
which it wrongly went into Equity. From
Common Law it is quite possible that it
will come back, like a comet in its orbit,
to the High Court for a decision on “a
mere point of law which does not require
the investigation of any facts,” to quote
the remark of one of the appeal Judges.
The round-about absurdity is to be attri-
buted to the out-of-date system which pre-
vails in the N.S.W. Supreme Court of deal-
ing out Law and Equity in two separate
jurisdictions, a system long since abolished
in England under the Judicature Act, where-
by Law and Equity are administered con-
currently, as is done also in Queensland
and in other States. In N. S. Wales a
person may have a writ, say in ejectment,
issued against him at Common Law, where-
on, following the strict principles of law,
he may fail to get justice, even though he
may have a complete defence in Equity.
His only remedy in that event is to fly to
the latter jurisdiction for relief by taking
out a statement of claim and obtaining an
injunction against his opponent, till Equity
decides the questions at issue, in one* way
or another. Thus the plaintiff at Common
Law becomes the defendant in Equity, so
that, instead of one there are two suits
pending in the same court but in separate
and opposing jurisdictions. For that is
really what it amounts to, in spite of the
fact that lawyers may quote the maxim,
“Equity follows the law.” In effect, his
Honor in Equity may issue an injunction
against his Honor at Common Law re-
straining him from proceeding with the
action till Equity shall have given its
decision, and, if in favor of the Equity
plaintiff, then from proceeding at all with
the action or any judgment therein.
In the case in question. Leventhal and
others proceeded against David Jpnes and
Co., Ltd., in ejectment at Common Law in
respect- of certain leased premises in George-
strcet, on the ground, as it was alleged, that
defendants had broken a covenant of the
lease. Defendants alleged certain breaches
of the lease by plaintiffs and sought relief
in the Equity Court, where they converted
the plaintiffs into defendants. The de-
fendants in Equity demurred to this pro-
cedure, but in the end the Equity Judge
decided that they had not broken any cov-
enant of the lease and dismissed the suit
with costs thereof and of the demurrer. It
was. against this decision that the plaintiffs
in Equity appealed. The result of the appeal
and the remarks of the Judges are illuminat-
ing as showing the tangle in which liti-
gants may find themselves under the pre-
vailing dual systems of Common Law
and Equity. The Chief Justice said that
the Equity Judge should have allowed the
demurrer at the outset. Justice Isaacs went
a step further and said that as the Equity
Judge had no jurisdiction to deal with the
case in Equity, the High Court had no
jurisdiction to decide the legal questions
involved. Justice Gavan Duffy thought
that the Equity Judge should merely have
allowed the demurrer and that the High
Court should allow it. Justice Rich said:
"It would be most inconvenient and unjust
to place the burden on the parties of re-
litigating the same facts at Common Law.”
Justice Starke was the one who made the
remark that the whole dispute involved “a
mere point of law,” and he supported the
commonsensible opinion of Brother Rich by
asserting that "no useful purpose would now
be served by setting aside the whole pro-
ceedings, and the Court should give its
judgment upon the substance of the matter.”
But the Court, by majority, didn’t do so,
and merely decided to dismiss the appeal
with costs, which seems to mean that the
original defendants have to face the Court
of Common Law again. If the Supreme
Court had been in a position to deal with
questions of Law and Equity under one
jurisdiction, all this jumble would have
been avoidable, and if either party wanted
to appeal it could have been done on clearly
defined points once and for all.
The State’s Attorney-General and Mini-
ster of Justice ought to concern themselves
with the early introduction of the Judi-
cature Act; and whilst they are about
Supreme Court reform they might also con-
sider the amalgamation of the inconsistent
and overlapping District and Small Debts
Courts jurisdictions by the introduction of
resident "Magistrates’ Courts,” as adopted
in Queensland. It does not seem any use
waiting for the somnolent Law Reform
Committee, or whatever it may be called,
to wake up' and do something in these
directions.

PLAIN ENGLISH.
Uncle Sam Builds a Navy.
New battleships, reconditioned old battle-
ships, higher gun-elevations and 26 new
10,000-ton cruisers represent Uncle Sam’s
reply to the failure of the Geneva
Conference. As a matter of fact, the pro-
gramme would have been much the same
had the conference achieved the result for
which America hoped, because what it really
wanted was England’s consent to a very
similar programme of construction.
There is no need to fear that the United
States contemplate making war on anyone
—yet. The U.S.A. temperament is such
that it hates to see money lying idle. So.
having a surplus of cash largely accumulated
by keeping out of the late war, America
hopes to spend some of it in acquiring
the one thing it has not at present got—
international prestige. So will the idle
money be made to work. England, on the
other hand, by her magnificent support for
the League of Nations and in many other
ways, has exerted a vast influence on inter-
national matters, quite disproportionate, in
America’s mind, to the amount of cash in
London. America rightly diagnoses that the
force behind Britannia’s prestige is the
Royal Navy, and argues not unnaturally
that, in order to reach a position to which
it thinks its dollars entitle it, America also
must have a big navy.
There need be no fear that America
contemplates war against anyone, least of
all ourselves; but it is well to look ahead
and visualise the position in five years’
time when the present £200,000,000 building
programme has been completed. The situ-
ation then will be that a large portion of
America’s surplus cash will have been con-
verted into warships and, short of aggres-
sion, there won’t be any use for them. The
thrifty American will hate just as much
having an idle asset on the national balance-
sheet as he now hates having idle money.
Inevitably therefore the United States will
be forced into world affairs—its people will
demand it—with the influence of the L T .S.
Navy operating, or inferred to be ready to
operate, as a weapon of offence instead of,
as in the case of the R.N., one of defence.
The result will be as unsatisfactory as it
always is when a small boy is given an air-
rifle and feels he must go out and shoot
something.
Democracies with powerful weapons in
their hands are notoriously hard to control
until they have got accustomed to using
the weapons in the right, way.

The Best Market of All.
The periodical outbreak of Freetrade
correspondence, maddened by the adverse
trade balance or something, has been rag-
ing in the S. M. Herald, and the familiar
“primary production” cranks have been in
full force. Some of them have been making


great play with a remark which the Tariff
Board lately threw off:—
"Whilst it is the declaimed policy of the
Commonwealth to assure to the local manu-
facturer, as to the local primary producer,
the domestic market under certain conditions,
it is a fact that, as far as secondary manu-
facture is concerned, this market constitutes
ihe limit in general practice, by virtue of
the high cost of production. Little or no
export market for secondary manufactured
products can be looked for at present.'
Wherefore the usual roar about “getting
people on the land” goes up like the smoke
of a great sacrifice.
As a matter of fact, no one need hustle
unduly to export “secondary manufactured
products” for a long while, and in time the
high cost of production may cure itself.
The urgent problem is not to import so
much of the “secondary” stuff. To illus-
trate the ease, in 1923-27
Exports of animal and vegetable
foodstuffs and drinks under 53
headings, including wheat, flour,
butter, beef, mutton, fruits of all
sorts and sugar, brought in . . .. £45,897,298
And for imports of metals, metal
manufactures and machinery, Aus-
tralia paid out .. .. .. 51,237,944
Also for imported clothing materials
and fibres Australia paid out .. 42,438,235
So if the Australian manufacturer has no
present hope beyond the local market, there
is the satisfaction of knowing that it is a
dashed big market and Ims still room to
grow.
And the sooner the nation concentrates
on supplying that market with secondary
products on a much bigger scale than
hitherto the better, for the evidence shows
that the attempt to pay its expensive and
lavishly-importing way with so-called pri-
mary products is a dead failure.
To save £1 by importing less is of more
account than to make 2d. by exporting
more. Also it is easier, and it saves freight
both ways.

Loafing on the Job.
While Governments are tinkering with the
legal machine, that section of the public
which has dealings with the Supreme ana
County or District Courts and legal depart-
ments would welcome the abolition of “the
long vacation.” Towards the end of Decem-
ber all litigation ceases—Justices, Judges,
barristers and others pack up and do not
resume their occupations until February.
Unfortunately, litigants are left kicking their
heels on the temple’s doorsteps. In Victoria,
in several departments (e.g. Probate, which
deals with non-contentious matters), the
administrative offices close during this vaca-
tion at noon, with the result that the public
servant, in addition to his ordinary annual
leave, knocks off for the day and slips
down to the ponies or the beach.
Even Judges require recreative holidays;
but there is no earthly reason why all hands
in a department should take them simul-
taneously. The administration of law and
justice to-day is like—or should be like—
any other business. Flinders-lane, the Mines
Department, or the registry offices of births,
deaths and marriages close only on recog-
nised public holidays. What a howl there
would be if the railways had a similar
“long vacation”! Yet the administration
of justice—in theory at any rate—is just
as important as the administration of a
transport system.
The “long vacation” is archaic. Over
1409 years ago the Church did not consider
it right that justice should be administered
on all days alike. So it exempted by canon
(a.d. 517) certain holy seasons from (as an
old writer puts it) “being profaned by the
tumult of forensic litigations.” His
Majesty the late King Edward the Con-
fessor, over 800 years ago, having in view
these canonical prohibitions, settled the com-
mencement and duration of what are now
called “the law terms.” These terms have
since been affected by legislation from time
to time; but at no period more than the
■ present has there been greater need for legis-
lative activity in regard to this wholesale
periodical downing of tools.
The Higgs Case.
The three young men who were acquitted
the other day on charges implicating them
in the murder of a motorist in a lonely
spot on the Blue Mountains (N.S.W.) have
reason to be thankful that the jurymen,
directed by a strong and very judicial Chief
Justice, based their decision on the evi-
dence tendered to them on oath. The
evidence, as is not unusual in such cases,
was entirely circumstantial. The utmost
that the Crown could prove was that the
accused must have been somewhere in the
vicinity when the crime was committed;
that a coat admitted to belong to one of
them was found, bloodstained, near the
scene of the murder; and that a car re-
sembling the one they had hired was seen
near the car of the murdered man shortly
after the time at which the crime must
have been committed. It was not a con-
vincing case, and the jury could hardly have
done otherwise than return the verdict it
did.
Absence of motive was the weakest spot
in the prosecution, and it was a weakness
which the Crown, to its credit, made no
attempt to fortify. But some of the sen-
sational newspapers of Sydney were not so
squeamish. Contemptuous both of courts
and facts, they had regaled their readers
with stories concerning the victim and the
accused which, if true, and supportable by
evidence, would have made conviction a
practical certainty. In countries which have
more respect for their judicial tribunals, the
publication of erroneous rumors in connec-
tion with a capital charge, or any other sort
of charge, is regarded as contempt of court,
and is punishable. Evidence given on oath
may be reported ; details of a crime as sup-
plied by the police or other reputable wit-
nesses are publishable; but discussions con-
cerning possible motives are, quite rightly,
barred.
The danger is a real one, and the only
way to avoid it is for the Courts to guard
their functions and to quell attempts by
newspapers to prejudge the issues that are
brought before them. In that most important
work the public can and should assist. If.
instead of encouraging newspapers to pre-
judge accused persons, they showed their
disapproval of prints which do that sort of
thing, that sort of thing would soon cease
to be done.
♦
The Arbitration Machine.
Having noted that the Federal Arbitration
Court and its awards are habitually flouted
by certain federations of workers’ unions,
the Bruce-Fages have decided to do some-
thing about it. It is a rather muddled
something, mainly devoted to enumerat-
ing some of the illegal things that parties
to awards have been doing, and to saying
that such things arc still illegal and should
not be done. There never was any question
as to the illegality of most of the acts
enumerated. The ordering of strikes by
union bosses without consulting the mem-
bers, and the deliberate infringements of
awards of the Court—infringements enforced
on members by threats and fines—were
clearly a defiance of constituted authority;
but the Court, unfortunately, has lacked
the ability or the courage to carry its
mandates through.
Attorney-General Latham’s new bill no
doubt clarifies the muddy condition of the
law in some respects, and, because of the
Constitutional limitation of the Common-
wealth’s powers to compulsorily arbitrate,
it plays a few variations on the old tune of
compulsory conciliation. But it would have
been a lot more impressive if the Bruce-
Pages had said that they intended the
Arbitration Court to be respected, and that
offences against its authority would, in
future, be punished, as provided by law,
without fear, favor or exception.

Melbourne Looks Ahead.
Melbourne has profited by experience, and
this year has as good an organisation
for fighting bush-fires in the environs of
the citx' as it is humanly possible to pro-
vide. Nearly 2000 volunteers have been
divided into sections and each section-
leader is responsible for his squad. A ’phone
ring from the central authority to banks
and other big business houses is calculated
to fetch out any divisions wanted with
promptitude. Transport is vested in the
R.A.C.V., and so many of its members
have offered their cars that at some recent
practice rallies firefighters have been almost
torn to pieces by motor-owners anxious to
assist. Each section is divided into fellers,
rakers and beaters, some of the last armed
with shoulder tanks with hose attached;
and the very necessaiy commissariat is sup-
plied by a feminine section equipped with
tea-making and bun-providing apparatus.
Several hundreds of the recruits have
already been initiated. Fires have been lit
in dense forests belonging to the State, and
the volunteers have been faced with a very
real problem in keeping the tornado of
flame from getting out of hand. One
useful thing they have discovered, to. their
surprise, is that the enemy is never actually
met face to face at all. The technique con-
sists of firing a break and letting the con-
flagration burn itself out. The science of
the thing is simple, but essential, and there
are now enough trained men to instruct the
rest of the brigade when the real thing hap-
pens. Colonel Luxton, Colonel Tom White
and others have imported some salutary
military discipline into the operations, and
the hordes of city enthusiasts, armed mainly
with beer and rushing round in Lizzies ask-
ing where the fire is, will now be superfluous.
The prevention of cataclysms like that
of February, 1926. is probably beyond the
strength of the Volunteer Bush Fire Bri-
gade; but, with all the danger zones under
local officers in touch with the centralised
control, there should be no more wholesale
losses of good lives.

Giving the Deuce His Due.
Archbishop Duiiig of Brisbane, who has just
returned from Europe, is a prelate with an
outlook unusual among archbishops in this
country. He has invariably dared to be
a good Australian, and has set an
example to the churchmen of all the
churches in his antipathy to sectarian and
racial obsessions. To a Westralian inter-
viewer a few days ago he had something to
say on the subject of Mussolini and his
work in Italy. The Italian Dictator has
few friends in this country, even among the
almost extinct Tory type, while to those
professing Labor and Moscow ideals he is
the foul fiend himself. But the Archbishop
sees another Mussolini beside the one who
thought out the castor-oil treatment for
intransigeants. There is the Mussolini
whose slogan is that Italy wants work, not
words, who made a bankrupt people sol-
vent, reorganised a great railway service
that was a byword for corruption and in-
efficiency, and has sent Italy back to earn-
ing its daily bread till only 100,000 are out
of work. Fascism was urgently needed in
Italy, and has been successful beyond the
wildest anticipations.
Whether the methods of Fascism are
applicable to Australian conditions is open
to argument, though drastic reforms in this
country’s methods of administration are
urgently needed, without any doubt about
it. In blunt truth, we are in very much the
same position as Italy was before Musso-
lini came to the rescue. We are horribly
loaded with debt, our industries are lan-
guishing, a large section of the popular
mind is poisoned with the ideals of Mos-
cow, we are loaded down with superfluous
politicians, bureaus, arbitration courts and
x hundred other useless and dream-castle
contrivances. Gambling, pleasure hunting,
loafing on the job, indifference to national
ideals—all these are about us everywhere.
Even if castor-oil be out of the question,
no thinking individual will honestly deny
that the body politic is sadly in need of a
purgative, and would be all the better for
adopting at least the Duce’s slogan of
“Work, not Words,” and then proceeding to
act up to it.

His Honor and the Carpenter.
One of the problems of the day is the need
for more housing. The Federal Govern-
ment proposes to attack it, and every State
has its own solution. Schemes for financing
the householder are offered through the
Savings Banks, gnd one can scarcely pass
a block in the heart of the city without
meeting advertisements urging the citizen
to become the owner of a home. And it is
or should be the ambition of the citizen to
have his own roof. It is one of the good
things of life to which he is entitled.
The extraordinary fact is that by some
unexplainable obtuseness he seems bent on
thwarting his own desire. If his wife were
to tell him that there would be a better
chance of making the scones go round their
large family if she baked fewer, he would
regard her as a fool. Yet lie does not see
himself in the same light when he proposes
to promote housing by building fewer
houses. Before the Full Court of Arbitra-
tion came recently the Amalgamated Car-
penters and Joiners. Once on a time they
used to work 48 hours a week, then they
came down to 44 and now they desire 40
hours. The reason given by Justice Higgins
for the reduction to 44 hours when other
craftsmen were working 48 was that carpen-
ters had “to follow the job.” Now that
there has been the all-round reduction in
hours to 44 the carpenters claim that, as
they are still following the job, they ought
to come down to 40. They are optimists,
indeed, if they believe that after a few
more reductions in their hours of toil there
will bo any jobs to follow.
At rare intervals words of wisdom fall
from the lips of the Arbitration Bench.
There are occasions when even the timid
pluck up enough courage to blurt out the
truth. Chief Justice Dethridge was the
valiant soul. He contrasted the condition
of the carpenters and joiners with that of
their fellow workers in the metal trades—
all to the advantage of the workers in
wood. Then he struck the problem of the
good wife and the scones, substituting
houses for the edible morsels:—
“It cannot, I think, be reasonably sug-
gested that the building-trades workmen,
working 44 hours as they do at present, are
subject to any undue fatigue. A reduction
to 40 hours would mean a loss of production
of something like one-eleventh. The lower
we get the working hours a week the lower
is the production. The cost of building is
largely made up of labor costs, and so far
as it is made up of labor costs, we at once
get an increase in the cost of building by
one-tenth. The people who will suffer chiefly
by the increased cost of labor are the workers
themselves.”
Judge Lukin agreed without any waste of
words, and Judge Beeby really could not “in
the present state of economic development”
favor the reduction of hours below 44 a
week, though what sort of development
’Sonah anticipated in bedrock economic
principles he did not say.
“If forty men on forty hours
Worked hard for half a year,
Do you suppose,” his Honor said,
“The house would be less dear?”
“I doubt it,” said the carpenter,
And shed a bitter tear.

How Australia Gets Itself Disliked.
Maorilanders never forget that, though
Australia made a magnificent response to
the call that was sounded one day in August
13 years ago, the Commonwealth rejected
the idea of conscription. The Shaky Isles
went the limit in that respect, and were
calling up elderly men with a tidy crop
of olive branches when the Armistice bugle
was sounded.
Australian public men haven’t done much
since to recapture the good opinion of
the folk across the Tasman. Indeed, in some
cases they have widened the rift. Joseph
Carruthers, who once upon a time was
Premier of N.S.W. and now occupies a
seat in the Ma State’s remarkable Top
House, is one case. He went to Samoa and
on his arrival back in Maoriland told the
islanders that he reckoned General Rich-
ardson, who administers the former Ger-
man colony for the Dominion under a Man-
date, was a high-handed brass-hat who ought
to be taught something about Magna
Charta. and Habeas Corpus and other verte-
bral bones of the British Constitution. The
Maorilanders, serious souls, were much dis-
tressed about it. First they sent over
Minister Noswortiiy to investigate these
charges, and then they set up a Royal Com-
mission. In effect the Commission found
that Richardson was doing his honest best
to rule Samoa fairly and squarely. He was
faced with a seditious movement among the
natives, engineered by white residents,
mostly of non-British extraction, and he
had used what powers he possessed—and
they were pretty extensive—to preserve
law and order. Richardson’s honesty of
purpose and ability as an administrator
were not impeached by a single witness—
and quite a lot of the disaffected whites and
natives were called before the Commission.
It has been found that he did some very
drastic things, but if he hadn’t done them
he would have fallen short of his duty.
Everybody in the Shivery Dominion who
knew Richardson knew also that no other
finding could be possible.
Carruthers hasn’t apologised for butting
into a squabble that wasn’t his business,
and butting in on the wrong side, and he is
not likely to. But the Maorilanders are
sore about it, and they have reason to bo.
What, however, they cun be assured about
is that “Cocky” Carruthers is no more
Australia than he was when ho fell out of
N. S. Wales active politics.

The Hyenas.
‘Old Wig”: Comment on cases sub judice
is banned by British law. This is a polite
fiction, and one that is evaded every day,
when it is not brutally ignored. Much
of the mischief in this respect is due to
the release of the Crown case to unscrupu-
lous individuals who represent it in the
most lurid light and tagged with their own
conclusions, in order to keep public inter-
est at fever heat and the jingling of the
public’s penny for the latest edition at
one unceasing fortissimo. This publicity
originates in the complaisance of public
officials, to begin with, who pay for the
limelight, and their pictures in the papers
with a loose tongue.
But even more harm is done by the de-
tailed presentation of the case in the lower
courts, and especially in the Coroner’s Court.
All the case and all the evidence against
the accused is made public in full detail.
It may be doubted whether this is neces-
sary in the cause of justice, and whether
in 99 per cent, of such cases there is any
necessity for taking detailed evidence at
all. It has little bearing on the result of
the ultimate trial before a jury. Much is
usually made of the theory that the rights
of the accused are safeguarded by the pub-
licity of proceedings. More often they are
prejudiced, not only because the actual
story is absorbed, discussed and weighed by
those who, theoretically, should know no-
thing of it—the members of the jury to be
—but because of the callous perversions and
inferences which are so often drawn from
it. Most magistrates of experience will be
inclined to agree that this elaborate pre-
sentation of evidence in the lower courts
is not essential to committal on a capital
charge. In fact, it is very seldom that one
hears of a magistrate taking the responsi-
bility of dismissing a capital charge, however
weak the preliminary evidence.
It may be urged that the accused is en-
titled to know everything that is to be
alleged against him, from the beginning.
There would seem to be a reply to that in
the imitation of the civil practice of each
party administering interrogatories to the
other, and replying to them.

New Australia on the Wheel.
“M.G.S.”: What a world of difference
Dunlop and Ford have made between them!
The other day I camped with some sur-
veyors on a closer settlement job in South-
ern Riverina. Apart from the engineers,
who all had their cars, there were less than
20 -workmen, and I counted eight petrol
chariots sheltering under the gums.
One man’s story was probably typical of
the rest. He was a Melburnian who had
served as an aerial photographer throughout
the war. Coming back, he became an
instructor at Point Cook, but being a fellow
with an infinite love of variety, he wearied
of the official round, built a couple of homes
in the suburbs with his own hands and sold
them, and sought jobs in nearly every corner
of the continent. Now he has taken up
800 acres of the Mallee and is putting in
time on the surveying job while his papers
are going through. If prosperity grips him,
he may even settle down.
All this time he has had a car. The sands
of a thousand duststorms have polished it
almost Clean of paint, but it still fires in
all cylinders as regularly as ever. It has
been with him on all his wanderings. Into
it go all his belongings, including his wife
and two children. Wherever they go they
form a tight little social unit. Whenever a
job is found it is the work of a few hours to
run up a moderately comfortable residence.
Wherever water is available—and it is aston-
ishing where water is available nowadays
with all this irrigation—the wife grows cab-
bages and tomatoes. It is an unusual job
which hasn’t a town with a cinema within
50 miles, so that the whole family can enjoy
the amenities of civilisation and submit to
the healing influences of Art at least once a
fortnight. If need be. the children can be
conveyed to school daily. When the job
is finished there are no regrets. In go the
baggage and the hessian sections of the
home; in go the b: by emu and the tame
onossum; in go the wife and kids. The
driver toots a farewell to his camp-mates
and a dozen horns respond. There are plenty
more tomato-patches to be made over the
blue horizon.

POLITICAL
POINTS
The Commonwealth Shipping Line dropped
another £596,833 in its last complete year.
It has now lost almost the price of the Com-
monwealth’s four railways, which measure
1733 miles in all, much more than would
have finished the South-to-North line across
Australia, and a great deal more than the
whole Tasmanian railway system cost. And
it isn’t much of a fleet to look at —perhaps
half a mile of commonplace tub.
The N.S.W. Government having inherited
nothing in London save an overdraft and
a bank manager who wanted the same re-
duced, it lately sold £3,000,000-worth of
Treasury Bills to pacify the pawnshop. Now
it is floating a £7,000,000 51 per cent, loan
at £99 10s. to pay off the bills, and pacify
the general creditor. The name of the Com-
monwealth isn’t on the back of this lOU,
for the Ma State didn’t join the Loan Council
in time, but the Commonwealth will take
charge of this item along with the rest, unless
some Narks contrive to spoil the new
arrangement.
Seldom does Vic. Assembly demand a
division on the formal and final motion that
a bill be transmitted to the Uppali Chambah,
but this was done on the Tote Bill. It
looked for a moment as if there would be
a tie, but in the end there was a majority
of two, as compared with nine on the second
rading. Had Speaker Snowball been called
upon to give a casting vote he would probably
have said “No,” as he did when numbers
were even on the Day Baking Bill.
Theodore contributed to the gaiety of the
House of Reps, last week when he attacked
Stanley Bruce for bringing on important
business without giving notice. He was fol-
lowed at once by Mat Charlton, who re-
marked that, “as Leader of the Opposition,”
with an emphasis on the phrase, he had been
consulted by the Prime Minister and had con-
sented to the course proposed. A newcomer
who aspires to wear another man’s shoes
shouldn’t be too impatient.
A strange tale from Russia concerns Trot-
sky, who lias been expelled from the Com-
munist movement and has gathered up a
following of his own. He is said to have
neither home nor telephone address because
of the police, but to turn up nightly at
gatherings of the elect, pour forth scathing
diatribes against the scribes and Pharisees
of his old mob, and then melt away to
shelter with some of his sympathisers.
If Lenin’s Jewish partner really has turned
prophet and reformer, the betting is that
Judas Iscariotsky will get him before long.
Ivilleu, M.Ii.R. for Riverina, annoyed the
representatives of maize-growing districts.
fellow-Cockies included, by opposing the in-
creased duties on glucose, of which 1270
tons, representing about half a million
bushels of maize, arrived last year from the
U.S.A. alone. “Alfred Deakin would turn in
his grave if he knew we were imposing such
heavy duties,” he protested. “See how your
convert will fall from grace when the new
duties on rice come on,” said the sarcastic
Blakeley to the jubilant Freetraders from
Westralia. There were loud bursts of merri-
ment in the House when Blakeley’s words
came true. Nearly all the rice-growers are
in Killen’s constituency.
When Vic.’s session closes this week per-
formance will have fallen lamentably short
of promise. The Ministry made the mistake
of attempting too much; then the “heads”
had the quadruple task of convincing first
the Government conclave of 12, then the
Caucus of 34 members, and next two Houses
in which Labor has a minority. The strain
of keeping Hogan and Co. in office has been
getting on the nerves of the Country Progs.,
as was shown when Dunstan, their leader,
rapped out something about its being time
an assurance was given by the Ministry that
the 1923 police-strikers would not be rein-
stated.
Queensland's Board of Trade has pro-
duced an award which covers practically
“THE BULLETIN” HAS ITS ANNUAL CHRISTMAS DREAM.
every kind of rural worker except the
market gardener and the dairy-hand. It
provides for a basic-wage beginning with
£3 18s. per week for agricultural laborers;
a 44-hour week; wage-and-a-half for over-
time, and compulsory membership in the
A.W.U., of which a member of the Board
used to be general secretary. Market gar-
deners are probably left out because the
Chinaman is too slippery, and dairy people
because the cow is too poor. Poverty is
suggested by the fact that Queensland lias
more women in its cow business than any
other State save X.S.W., the figures being
21,583 males and 15,016 females. The
Commonwealth is reported to have 63,454
women “on tlie land,” and 49,836 pursue
the unintelligent moo-animal.
The inevitable committee has been
appointed to consider the street congestion
of Sydney. It will probably make a pile of
recommendations, but it won’t propose that
the Ma State should get a new city or
two, and shift some of the congestion there.
Sydney threatens to become a maze of
streets ticketed for one-way traffic, one-day
traffic, Sunday traffic, or 110-day traffic.
For six years Maoriland has been trying
to improve its country tracks by subsidising
the work done by local authorities on roads
gazetted as “main highways.” Part of the
money was found by earmarking the Customs
duty on tyres and tubes, part from license-
fees paid by owners of motor vehicles, and
part by direct allocations from the general
revenue. Now there is to be a petrol-tax of
4d. a gallon, estimated to produce £720,000
a year. Motorists haven’t very strenuously
objected—they’d do almost anything to see
the Shivery Isles well roaded.
A recent report had it that General Cliiang
Kai-shek, the most persistent great gun of
the Chinese “National” Uproar, had gone
north to be married to a rich girl. In his
absence (or in something or other) the
Communist element relighted the torch of
Liberty, and at recent advices the native city
of Canton was ablaze in 43 places. Old
Canton and its 126 places of heathen worship
would burn beautifully. (London, when a
walled city covering 355 acres and contain-
ing 126 parish churches, also burned beauti-
fully. The Danes, who were the Bolsheviks
of the period, attended to that.) One result
is that the National Uproar has ordered all
Russian consuls and agents out of China, but
they aren’t likely to go.
Maoriland, possibly because it doesn’t
make much of a song about its loans, has
a reputation for leaning rather lightly on
Bull’s pawnshop counter. But since May,
1920, the gross indebtedness of the Shivery
Isles has been increased by £44,680,000, and
the rate of borrowing steadily increases.
1' or the last seven years the average annual
flotations work out at £6,400,000, for the
last three years at £8,000,000, and for the
last two years at £9,500,000. Brisk going
for a country with a population not much
greater than that of Sydney.
Reporting on various experiments in State
socialism, the N.S.W. Auditor-General an-
nounces that £97,000 has been lost on saw-
mills, £330,400 on timber-yards and building
workshops and £318,200 on trawlers. These
‘undertakings” are now “inoperative”—the
undertaker has attended to them, in fact.
Of those still being carried on, the Murrum-
bidgee Irrigation Area consumed £318,201
last year, and the Newcastle dockyard £6700.
On the other hand, the brickworks showed a
profit of £34,800, the Monier pipeworks a
profit of £30,200 and the metal quarries a
profit of £22,100. These three enterprises
have profit-sharing schemes —the brickmakers
divided £11,450 last year, the pipeworkers
£6500 and the quarrymen £6700. Such
schemes are abhorred of all good socialists
and communists, but they work.
Two young barristers, Street and Cantor,
have, been appointed to join Good Old Piddo
on the N.S.W. Industrial Commission so
that he may be only a Fair-to-medium Old
Piddo in the future. They are to have the
status of a Supreme Court Judge; and they
could have the status so far as The
Bulletin cares if they were not called
Judges or their meeting place a court. Mr.
Beeby, for instance, probably did quite a
sensible thing the other day in order to
settle the waterside trouble; but it wasn’t
the sort of thing a Judge should do or a
Court should tolerate. Courts shouldn’t
negotiate and compromise; and so-called
Courts of Arbitration must do both, if they
are to earn their salt.
Throwing mud at Amalgamated Wireless,
Ltd., is becoming one of the recreations
of Canberra politicians. A Labor Senator'
flung the taunt that the concern makes
profits, a crime of which many Government
and semi-Government enterprises are guilt-
less. Still, there is something to be said for
the culprit, foul as its offence may be. Be-
sides the activities which everybody knows,
like beam wireless and the land and coastal
stations in Australia and New Guinea, it
equipped and operates 150 stations on board
merchant ships ; it equipped the police patrol-
cars in the big cities; and it published the
first wireless newspaper on Australian ships.
Then it operates telephone services on
trawlers, so that fishing masters can keep
in touch with their markets; and its small
power-transmitters are at work on remote
sheep- and cattle-stations, in lighthouses and
undertakings like Burrinjuck. The majority
of its goods are manufactured in Australia,
and with 850 employees it ranks as the
second largest radio concern in the Empire.
A veteran of 40 years’ experience told
the Federal Constitution Commission that
Australia will be out of both the beef and
mutton export trade in 10 years. The busi-
ness reached a sort of pinnacle in 1913, when
424 million pounds were exported, about
half ox and half jumbuck. The figures have
not been approached since. In 1925-26 the
Commonwealth exported a little over
£7,000,000-worth of edible dead animal.
Argentina, in 1925, exported £34,000,000
worth to the United Kingdom alone. The
witness complained that Governments here
are unsympathetic, which is more or less
true. As an example, in a period of eight
consecutive years a Queensland station lost
£1533. Yet the owner had to pay £1759 in
Federal and £3826 in State income-tax
(£5585 in all), because he paid in full in
good years and got no refund in bad ones.
For no discoverable reason except petty
grumpiness the Vic. Uppish House threw
out the Hogan Government’s Estate- and
Business-Agents Bill, a simple measure to
protect the community against an out-
rageously aggressive class of sharks and rob-
bers, and a small bill providing that lift-
attendants must be qualified for their job.
If any of the rejected Hogan measures is
passed again by next Assembly and again
rejected by the Uppish Chamber, the Govern-
ment can demand a dissolution of both
Houses. The interval might be profitably
spent in getting new electors on the roll and
shaking up old ones till their teeth rattle.
Labor-leader Charlton is getting so tired
of his thankless job that he may resign
before Parliament reassembles. Of late his
position has frequently been usurped by the
bigger Theodore; when the latter speaks lie
dominates his fellows, though Scullin will
not willingly play second-fiddle even to him.

THE REAL POLITICIAN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“You are not compelled to be consistent; if you
are a real politician you will not be.” — Mr. Tunne-
cliffe, M.L.A.
You must be patient, bold and shrewd,
And silver-tongued, and thick of skin
(For votes are shy and voters rude)
When spurs political you’d win.
In truth, in one you have to weld
Qualifications not a few 7 ;
But never think that you’re compelled
To pick a line and stick thereto.
The weather-cock fulfils its mission
By veering to each changing wind;
Likewise the real politician
Is never slow to change his mind.
On hustings with becoming heat
Your promises you loudly scream,
But does it mean that, once the seat
Is yours, your words you must redeem?
That foolishness is out of date
And, if to such a creed you cling,
You’re like to wake and find, too late,
You’ve done a suicidal thing.
For votes you’ll picture swift fruition
Of voters’ dreams; but, polls behind,
Show you’re a real politician,
And never fear to change your mind.
Should pits before your party yawn,
You needn’t feel depressed or sore.
Each day will bring a brand-new dawn ;
Convictions have been changed before;
And he alone is worldly wise
Who will discard outmoded tools,
Who marks the way his interest lies
And leaves consistency to fools.
Let others blunder to perdition
For principles, if they’re inclined.
The real, dirikum politician
Has often got to change his mind.

“Bill O’C.”: Pity there should be so many
duplicated and triplicated place-names in
tin; Commonwealth. Who hasn’t had occa-
sion at some time to curse the fact that
a casual correspondent, postmaster or tele-
graph-operator has failed to distinguish
between, say, the “Gladstone” in N.S.W.
and those in Q., S.A. and Tas. V To show
the value of a distinctive name, some years
ago I wanted to send a cablegram from the
United States to Burnside (S. Aus.). To
be on the safe side I added to the address
the city, State and Commonwealth. A
sharp Yankee clerk struck out all but the
“Burnside,” and in answer to my doubts
assured me that there was only one tele-
graph station of that name on the face of
the earth, lie further produced a book to
verify his contention. On arrival at Mel-
bourne I sought to send a telegram to the
same station, and an Australian clerk
pushed the form back with a curt “insuffi-
cient address.” lie was quite put out, too,
when I argued the point.

“Rikki T.”: “M.G.S.” expresses pity for
“anybody who harbors the delusion that the
song of birds is the sweet thing that poets
rave about” (B. 8/12/’27). Some of our
millions of birds certainly make harsh noises ;
but our best singers have voices of sweet
and powerful quality, and often produce
melodies so lucid and charming that they can
be, and have been, used as the basis for
vocal and instrumental compositions. One
of these. Henry Tate’s Australian symphony
“Dawn,” has been performed without evoking
“hisses from the audience.” I have seen
this careful and fastidious musician’s note-
book full of phrases and three- or four-bar
scraps of melody written down in the bush
straight from the beaks of the artists. There
is no time to give “M.G.S.” all the names
of the performers of “allegedly tuneful song”
he demands; but the magpie, grey thrush,
pallid cuckoo, butcher-bird (one of the best),
reed-warbler and lyrebird are outstanding.

“The Rumpus”: I met a pseudo-male
(B. 10/12/’27) when I was a steward on
inter-State coasters between Melbourne and
Townsville; lie was a young commercial
traveller, who struck me as singularly grace-
ful and handsome. When leaving the boat
at a northern port lie casually mentioned
he “would see me again,” a stock phrase of
SOFTENING THE BLOW.
TESSA (after rejecting lam): “But I'm awfully bucked you did propose to me, Bill.
It puts me one up on Madge — she’s only had four this year.”
old hardened travellers who do not feel in-
clined to tip. About six months later a lady
boarded that same boat at Townsville,
specially asked for the same berth in which
my good-looking young man had slept, and
sat herself at table in the identical chair
lie had used. Incidentally, I may add the
lady was the replica in features and color-
ing of the commercial traveller. When she
left at Melbourne she smiled at me and
said : “I told you, steward, I would see you
again.” A moment later I found a sovereign
in the pocket of my stewarding jacket.
“Hinemoa" : The Maori is the white man’s
superior in at least one respect (B.
24/11/’27), viz., in public speaking. He
never has any trouble with his aitches.
neither does he fill his speeches with “crs”
nor “urns.” Finally, he never interrupts
another man who is speaking, though he
may pull the other fellow’s ideas to pieces
when his own turn comes. A korero is
a lesson in public speaking and politeness.
In other ways I think the race has shown
more initiative than “.T.E.” gives it credit
for. When the first white settlers arrived
in Maoriland they found the fortified pahs
included dug-outs and trenches similar t«
those used in the late war. As far as is
known no other race, black, brown or yellow,
had advanced, if such a word may be em-
ployed, to such a stage. Maori forts were
usually placed on a high hill, and how the
water problem was solved has remained a
mystery to this day.
“Kai te Kuri”: Touching the Maori’s
chance of survival (B. 24/11/’27). In pre-
pakelia days it is estimated that the race
numbered upwards of 2(X),000. They de-
creased to under 40,000 in the ’eighties, but
have been slowly increasing ever since. Per-
sonally, I think the Maori will be absorbed,
not brought to extinction, by the pakelia.
The number of people with Maori blood
in their veins will increase enormously in
the next 50 years, but the full-blooded Maori
will gradually become rarer and rarer. After
all, this is a very different thing from the
fate which has overtaken the North American
Indian and the Australian aboriginal.

“Carisbrook, Jun.”: The other night an
artist scheduled to broadcast a song from
2FC, Sydney, was advised that her pianist
was in Brisbane. There was a brief con-
sultation, and the pianist was asked to play
from 4QG, the Brisbane station. Her per-
formance was picked up in Sydney and
superimposed on the Sydney station’s trans-
mitter; then, with a pair of headphones
clamped aver her ears, the Sydney vocalist
sang to the Brisbane accompaniment. Until
the process was explained by the announcer
at the end of the item, the listeners-in never
realised that the singer and the pianist were
•100 miles apart.
“Tasmaniac” : The Speck had a white man
who lived with the blacks for more years
than John Wilson (B. 8/12/’27). In 1780
the Regent Fox arrived off the coast. A
bos'n had scared one of the apprentices,
Samuel Jervis, with a yarn that, because
of some boyish pranks, the captain intended
to maroon him on a desert island. Jervis
was sent ashore with a boatload of sailors to
obtain fresh water, and cleared olf into the
bush. The sailors, after a fruitless search
for the fugitive, returned to the ship aad
reported him lost. After wandering about for
a couple of days Jervis met some aborigines
who treated him kindly; and lie remained
with the tribe for 23 years. In 1812 he unex-
pectedly ran across a party of whites, and
was persuaded to return to civilisation. A
family- named Cox gave him employment,
and lie subsequently took their name. His
experiences couldn’t have impaired his
health, for he lived to become the Speck's
oldest inhabitant, dying in 1891 in the Laun-
ceston Invalid Asylum. If the dates are
right he must have been 115 at least.
“Rob P.”: The latest accessory offered
Brisbane motorists is the “Risk Plate,” a
square of polished brass on which is em-
bossed the intimation that anyone accepting
free transport in that particular car does
so at his own peril. By some freak of the
law it is permissible for the friend or
acquaintance or even the mere wayfarer who
lias been accommodated with a lift to claim
compensation from his host at the wheel in
case of accident and injury. The “third-
party” policy doesn’t cover free passengers,
but the “Risk Plate,” prominently displayed,
draws Brown’s attention to the fact that
if lie rides with Jones he will be required to
pay liis own hospital or funeral expenses in
the event of a smash.

What tender music in the name of "Jim”!
liis strength, his wisdom, who could dream
of doubting?
The sweet young thing would harvest every
word.
And store it in thought’s granary as though
It were a Solon's wisdom... .seems absurd.
But then, you see, ’twas donkey’s years
ago.
Too soon the feathers moulted. Still, she
tried
Against the whisper of insistent reason
To quote “my husband” with uncertain
pride—■
Until to doubt him seemed no longer
treason.
Until to doubt, in fact, became a habit,
So often proved he wrong. No longer loath,
She, who had got the measure of her Babbitt,
Would often do (lie thinking for them
both.
Not that he ever knew. For auaviter
in modo is a method serviceable.
She humored every whim, and stroked his
fur
Until the silken thread became a cable.
And when the tale of twenty years was told,
No longer “Jim,” nor even “James,” but
“Dad,”
The glamor faded like the tarnished gold
Of moth-wings crushed beneath a kitten's
pad.
His politics, liis venerable jokes,
His explanations when lie’s off his game—-
She knows them all; and says to women-
folks,
“Just like a man. My dear, they’re all
the same.”
WHEN HER PATIENCE WORE OUT.
“I've never seen such dreamy eyes.”
“No, I daresay not. You’ve never stayed so late anywhere else, I’m sure.”
And yet—a paradox that claims surprise—
Although she knows he isn’t very clever,
And, if the truth were told, not even wise,
In spite of all, she loves him more than
ever.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Last night the sea was sleeping, still.
Breathing as soft as any child;
A new moon swung above the hill.
The evening airs were sweet and mild.
Upon my lips I felt the kiss
You left mo with —one night like this.
To-night the wind is from the east,
And from the beach the sullen sound
Of breakers boiling up like yeast
Summons the ghosts of all the drowned.
I pray for gleam of morning light—-
How can she rest on such a nightV

MERVYN O'HARA.


“Elsternwick”: I do a quantity of fine
needlework, and seek to dispose of it person-
ally. I submitted some to the manageress
of a suburban store last week. She scrutin-
ised it closely, and pronounced decidedly,
"You are out from Home!” I didn’t answer
for a moment, and she went on : “You wonder
liow I know. No Australian girl can sew
like this,” and she shot a disparaging glance
m the direction of her two assistants, who
looked properly crushed. They cheered up
a bit when I announced my nationality. I
got a small order, but I am convinced it
would have been a much better one if I had
claimed English or French birth.
* * * *
“A. 0.”: I met him in London, soon after
the Armistice, at the headquarters of a society
which dabbles in books, coins, papyri and
the like, a man of under medium height
and looking even smaller when seated. He
said he was certain that the last word had
not been spoken concerning hidden variations
in Greek lettering. He hinted at experi-
ments of his own, a little printing-press, and
essays in cryptography. There was some talk
of Hellenic tacliygrapliy, and several pre-
viously obscure passages in Aristophanes
became clearer. It was a meeting that
widened my store of knowledge. But these
places have their closing hours, and presently
we gathered our respective bundles of books
and maps, and drifted off, each his separate
way. Not a word of the desert had passed;
yet—the other man was Lawrence of Arabia.
* * * *
“Skyrider”: The recent collision in Bris-
ban e-avenue, Canberra, when a big ’bus
smashed a touring car and killed a woman
is an indictment of the Federal Commis-
sion’s slavish adherence to plans which pav
no heed to contours. The blind intersection
where the accident occurred is the dread of
motorists, for the shoulder of a hill masks
vehicles approaching in one direction. The
Commissioners’ policy has resulted in some
queer tangles, and an. immense amount of
waste of cash, but this is the first time death
has collected a toll. Strangely enough, the
fatality took place at one of the few right-
angles in a city composed mainly of curves
* * - ; * *
“Windsor”: Various experts have
attempted to set forth exactly what drunk-
enness is, and now the B.M.A. has supplied
a medical definition :
“Drunk” should always be taken to mean that the
person concerned is so much under the influence of
alcohol as to have lost control of his faculties to
such an extent as to render him unable to execute
safely the occupation on which he was engaged at
the material time. There is no single medical test
by itself which would justify a medical man in sav-
”s that a person was drunk within the meaning
of the above. &
The thing is lucid enough ns fnr ns it goes
but one cnn’t see the definition helping n
perplexed John on point duty much
* * *
“Henry Horsecollar”: Some remnrks of
mine (B. 17/13/27) about nn engngement
on the Dend Sen during the Grent Wnr
moved Merris” (B. 8/12/’27) to stnte tlint
f.was wholly wrong, and to kindlv furnish
his own details. If one man is alluding to
tlie sea fight at Actiura, and a critic scampers
into print to say that his remarks are a
wholly incorrect description of the siege of
Ladysmith, misunderstandings are inevitable.
lie scrap I had in mind didn’t happen at
Kujm el Balir (at least that name wasn’t
mentioned), but on a bit of beach near old
Sodom, at the south end of the Dead Sea
I here were no Australian Light Horse in
the vicinity then, and I haven’t heard that
finy ever went to that part. It is difficult
to imagine why they should. No Germans
appeared in the story, and it is too late for
them to come in now. An Arab force
attached to or semi-detached from the great
Arabian army which Lawrence organised
found a Turkish Dead Sea fleet of a sort’
including some motor craft with light guns’
moored along shore. Barring a very few
men on Avatch the owners were out of sight,
being away breakfasting, or loafing, or
sleeping, or killing somebody. The sons of
tne desert slew the Avatclimen, bored holes
m the fleet, wasted it with fire and sword,
threw the mangled armada overboard, and
skipped, according to their usual bite-and-
run tactics, just as the panting Turks began
to arrive. Lowell Thomas wrote that this
was the only, case in history of a naval
engagement being won by caAmlry, which was
hardly correct, for French horsemen, riding
out on the ice, once secured the surrender
of some frozen-in Dutch warships. I never
heard that the above-mentioned Dead Sea
fleet was raised, or was Avorth raising. The
statement of “Merris,” that it was “the
Germans, not the Turks,” who introduced
motor-boats and towed grain barges by their
agency on the Defunct Fluid is open to
question. Standing on the shore of that
r luid, just beside a booth Avliere bad liquor
wuis sold, years before the war, something
alleged to be Turkish motor mercantile
marine Avas visible to me in the distance.
-V'd the oily little ship in which I traversed
the Sea of Galilee was genuine enough.
“F.H.A.”: A passage in David Goseler’s
book “Lawrence, Prince of Mecca,” con-
clusively bears out “Henry Horsecollar's”
account of the engagement on the Dead Sea.
AUSTRALIA’S POPULAR CHRISTMAS PANTOMIME—
“BEAUTY AND THE BEACH."
Here it is: “General Alleuby required the
Arabs to prevent any flanking movement the
lurks might make from the southern end
of the Head Sea, and to this end Lawrence
determined to destroy the Turkish trans-
port fleet, which consisted of several obsolete
vessels and a few motor-driven craft mount-
ing light guns. A body of Bedouin horse-
men, reconnoitring the southern shores, dis-
covered the vessels moored close to the shore
and deserted, except for a few sleepy sentries.
The Bedouin leader rushed his men aboard,
lulled the sentries and then scuttled the
boats. By the time the Turks had grasped
that their Dead Sea flotilla had been defeated
and sunk by cavalry, the Bedouins were
galloping away through the darkness.”

“Clerk”: Stories of dogs that refuse lo
be lost (B. 8/12/’27) remind me of a Vic.
rail engine-driver who sought to rid himself
of a nondescript canine that had attached
itself to his family in North Melbourne.
He took Towser with him on the footplate
in a box one morning when he was running
to Seymour, duly dumped out the animal on
to a strange, inhospitable platform with a
sigh of relief, and ran another train back
that evening to Melbourne. Signing off at
the dep6t, he strode home to find the dog
waiting patiently for him outside the front
gate. Thereat his feelings towards the tyke
underwent an entire change. “It beat the
blanky train home,” he told his friends with
profane admiration—“raced the flamin’ ex-
press from Seymour to Melbourne! I
wouldn t part with the runt for anything.”
What actually happened Avas that he had
unfolded his design to the guard on his train,
and that humorous official had scooped the
dog into the van on the same train which
the. driver took back from Seymour and had
amiably released it on arrival at North
Melbourne.

“Eureka” : The man who cleans the drain
that carries the water away from the artesian
bore baths at Moree (N.5..W.) finds some
quaint jetsam from the women’s baths. Once
hairpins were too common to be worth re-
trieving, but since the advent of the bob and
shingle the cleaner stoops down and souvenirs
an occasional sample. Powder puffs, A r anity
cases, lipstick cases, combs, suspenders (now
rare), jazz garters and nail-files are numer-
ous. Hi s comparatively recent spoils include
a wig and a set of false teeth. The teeth
were claimed but the wig still awaits an
owner.
* * * *
u <^e^ re< i Volt”: The confusion between
“knots ’ and “nautical miles” mentioned by
“X.N.0.” seems worse in the cable service
than anywhere else. There “nautical miles”
are called “nauts” for short, and “nauts” is
pronounced “knots.” Cables are measured
in “nauts,” which are SOO feet shorter than
statute miles; hence, according to land
reckoning, a long cable may fall short of its
destination by 100 miles or so. Electricians
get over the difficulty by talking about a
break in a cable being so many “ohms away.”
Each mile measures a given number of
ohms, or units of resistance, as per manu-
facturers’ specification. The only other
trouble of importance is that the ohm varies
with temperature, so thermometers have to
be lowered to the ocean bottom when the
cable is laid. Those sunless depths don’t
vary much, so the original readings are near
enough for the life of any cable.
* $ * »
“C.Q.”: Are there any limits to the duties
of the Australian policeman? A constable,
signing off the other morning at Bendigo,
reported the arrival of a new comet on liis
beat during the preceding night. His official
caution may have been justified, for a British
astronomer has since described the visitor as
a “suspicious character.”
* H= * *
“Verri”: It isn’t only in New Guinea that
gaol regulations are elastic. Some years
ago a Sydney woman who was buying
guavas from a native at Fiji was startled,
when a bell rang somewhere in a Suva
street, to see her vendor drop the fruit he
had been selecting for her, pick up his
basket and race madly up the wharf. A
bystander assured her that the Fijian had
not suddenly become demented. “It’s all
right,” he explained politely, “you'll see him
to-morrow. He's just gone back to gaol.
That bell rang for the prisoners to get back
to prison, and your man had to run because
he has the key and has to unlock the place
to let the others in!”
❖ % ❖ *
“Tyrt”: “L.C.M.” (B. l/12/’27) is right
in saying that the lay mind loves a really
nasty remedy, but he is unfortunate in the
choice of illustrations. I have known a doctor
to prescribe garlic in the socks for whooping-
cough. And he was no smalltown quack
either, but a man with a large city practice.
* * * *
“Flagwagger”: There are many reasons
why Diggers are ceasing to wear their brass
badges, but a battalion cobber of mine has
added to the number. The lure that lies ill
flappers’ eyes has always attracted him, and
although he is on the wrong side of 30 he
dresses so smartly and keeps himself so fit
that he still passes as being in the early
twenties. But when he assured his latest
affinity he was 23 on his last birthday, she
pointed to his brightly polished badge and
remarked with gentle guile: "So you were
only 14 when the war ended. You must
surely have been the youngest Digger.” The
brass badge now reposes in an old box with
other war junk.
“A.J.8.”: “Zirk” is in error when
he says that the ill-fated Koombanu
was not equipped with wireless. I
w r as a passenger on the last voyage
she ever made., and left her at Point
Sampson a few days before she dis-
appeared at the beginning of April,
1912. After leaving Carnarvon the
purser handed me a telegram which
called for an immediate reply, and I
tried to send a wireless message, but
was informed that it could not be
done; although the ship had wireless
she could not speak to Fremantle un-
less there w r as an overseas vessel with
wireless in port, the Perth station
not being ready for business. I asked
them to try for a ship anywhere near
the coast, but they failed to get
through, and I had to wait for the
next port. If any of the vessels men-
tioned by “Zirk” had been within
reach, the Koombana’s call must have
been picked up, although even in that
case, it is doubtful if any assistance
could have been given in that “blow.”
The Bullara, owned by the same com-
pany but without wireless, left Port
Hedland immediately after the Koom-
bana got outside, and going south, had
the blow behind her. A week later
she limped into Point Sampson, and,
after refitting a bit, made an unsuc-
cessful search for the missing vessel.
Not so much as a plank of the Koom-
bana has ever been found.

“Mako” : Mountaineering has always
been a favorite pastime of British
Minister Amery, and though his Maori-
land tour has been the usual headlong
rush, lie found time to see something
of the Dominion’s lofty peaks. Egmont,
the Taranaki 8000 ft. cone, staged
cloud effects and icy winds that sent
the party back when within 1300 ft.
of the summit, as the ascent would
have involved step-cutting up the ice-
slope to the top. In the Southern
Alps the party had better luck, and
besides the Iloclisetter Dome managed
to climb the beautiful Minarets, but
they merely looked respectfully at
Aorangi (Mt. Cook), the giant of the
company, whose 13,000-odd feet are not
to be attacked without preparation.
The energetic little Secretary of State
lias since been telling Maoriland that
it has mountain scenery more wonder-
ful than that of Switzerland, and that
the great Tasman Glacier, reputed the
longest in the world outside of Ant-
arctica, is not advertised loudly
enough by the Dominion.

“Erua”: The custodians of the
valuable Grey Collection in the Auck-
land Public Library had an agreeable
surprise recently when they came upon
an uncatalogued wash drawing by
William Blake, the existence of which
was unknown to them. It depicts “Lot
and His Daughters,” and although un-
finished is an exceedingly valuable find
at a time when the drawings and en-
gravings of Blake are being eagerly
sought by collectors. There is a lot of
the famous poet-engraver’s work which
may turn up some day; all the engrav-
ings he did for his friend Hayley dur-
ing his sojourn with the patron of art
at Feldham, in Sussex, have vanished,
and collectors have failed to trace their
whereabouts.

BALLADE OF PORK AND POETRY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I cannot make ethereal rhyme
On things like artichokes and nuts:
My verse is never so sublime
As when, replete with juicy cuts
Of well-cured ham, my soul rebuts
(By stoutly wielded knife and fork)
The foolishness of those poor mutts
Who find no loveliness in Pork.
The Hindoo, in his torrid clime,
„ Has famines oftener than gluts ;
Yet counts a hunk of hog a crime
And wilts in sacerdotal ruts
Along with Guggenheim and Stutz:
The human engine misses torque
Or ignominiously pliuts
Without the loveliness of
Kunners may make their fastest time
Golfers achieve their deftest putts
By eating lentils in a slime
And drinking out of water-butts •
For me, the Muses act like sluts,
And no Pierian draughts uncork,
The attic air seems full of smuts,
Without the loveliness of Pork.
Envoy.
Prince, the fruitarians’ “Tut, tuts”
Leave me unruffled as a stork.
’Twere vain for them to but me buts
About the loveliness of Pork.

“Naklioda”: Friends resident in Darwin
recently came down on holidays to Melbourne
with their black help and left her temporarily
with us. They explained that Biddy had
cleanly habits and would give us no con-
cern so long as she was given her own
ablutionary apparatus. My wife took her
into the bathroom, which contains a large
mirror, and indicated whose appliances were
whose. In a sweep of the arm she had
included the mirror among my male pos-
sessions. Biddy was brightly receptive. Next
morning she came downstairs with her own
soap, her own towel, her own toothbrush —
also her own looking-glass!

“D.N.8.”: Tiji may be quite unsuitable

When I was in France a driver broke his

resting infantry battalion near by was tax-
ing the dentist to the utmost, and he was
doing extractions only. “Right,” said
.Timmy. “I’ll take me plate to the farrier.”
That handy tradesman not only mended the
broken plate perfectly by means of silver
plates fixed with tiny silver rivets fashioned
from a silver coin, but lie made his own
instruments to handle the delicate job.

“Imbaga : Now fb;t stock-trains and
motor transport are beginning to cut into
Clancy’s droving job in Australia, bis spirit,
at least, seems to have betaken itself to
1 apua There, the other day, the first large-
scale droving attempt in the history of the
upended isle was
undertaken, when
the B. N. G. Devel-
ment Co. shifted 70
head of mixed
cattle from Pnili
plantation, on the
headAvaters of the
Übu g a u River,
across the Kemp
Welch River to
Sogeri, behind Port
Moresby, 170 miles
away. The only
previous effort in
this line that the
writer can recall
w r as the attempt of
the then R.M. at
Tamata, on the
Mambare, to shift
his precious herd
of goats, the only
ones for hundreds
of miles, fr o m
Tamata to the new
station at loma.
The distance was
only five miles or
so, but it was
j nngl e, and the
attempt ended in
blasphemy, the
stock being as
amenable to drov-
ing ideals as split
quicksilver is to
being picked up in
the fingers. In his
wrath the R.M.
sold his refractory
stock at £1 per
head to a store-
keeper who was
remaining at the
old address. The
only sweetening in
his cup of bitter-
ness was that one of the matrons of the flock
presented her Capricornian lord with twins
before the bangtail muster was completed.

“Hayband”: The Mission Hall at Seven
Hills (N.S.W.) is the most diversified place
of entertainment I r ve struck. The' village
isn’t large enough to afford a public hall;
nor is any religious denomination sufficiently
numerous to support a house of worship all
t'o itself, so. the place is used, in accordance
with the wishes of the man responsible for
its erection, “for all purposes.” On a recent
Saturday night a boxing contest was con-
ducted therein, with the usual beer-bottle
trimmings. Next morning, after the ficdd
of battle had been hosed, the bangs and yells
of the Salvos rose to the roof. In the after-
noon the 0. of E. used the building as a
Sunday-school, and after sundown the Cath-
olics held evening service. It is also the
local dancing-hall and polling-booth, and the
venue of flower shows and similar exhibi-
tions. Recently a meeting was held to
decide whether this variegatedness was right
and proper, and after a strenuous argument
Seven Hills decided in the affirmative.
Wherefore the hall remains the home of jazz,
stoush, religion (any brand) and anything
m between.
* * * *
“Morkrum”; The trouble with all high-
speed systems of machine telegraphy is that
they are too “touchy.” On Dec. 9 climatic
conditions between Brisbane and Sydney be-
came variable and both Murray circuits
promptly struck. A valuable hour or more
was lost trying to get them going again,
the business meanwhile piling up. Then it
was decided to join Wheatstone sets (slower
but more reliable) to the wires over which
the Murrays refused to function. This
worked, but about half the messages were not
delivered till next day. In a good mood the
Murray system is a marvel; eight streams
of messages (four each way) are conveyed
over a single wire, all at a compulsory
42 w.p.m. clip. But it is erratic; hence the
department approaches Christmas with fear
in its heart. Anything untoward, such as a
shower of rain or a dead calm, may work
serious mischief.

“X2X”; The fate of the small boy who
died while under an anaesthetic in a Sydney
public hospital, from causes due to an enlarged
thymus gland, calls attention to one of the
problems which modern medical science has
not yet been able to solve. Very few people
are possessed of enlarged thymus glands;
should one of such be anaesthetised for
surgical purposes, collapse and death are
almost a certainty. And there is no possible
way by which such a condition of the gland
a very small one allied in function with
the thyroid gland—may be detected; it is
rarely that it .is even suspected. The last
casualty of this sort happened in Victoria,
and in that case, too, the victim was a
mere child.
* * * *
“Momokeni”; Food which would normally
have gone into the swill-tubs (B. 17/11/’27)
xept England going during the dark days
of the war. I was head of due of the largest
Y.M.C.A. hostels in. London at a time when
every month brought stricter regulations and
more severe inspectors. Plate leavings, be-
coming smaller as rationing was more closely
enforced, were carefully
sorted after each meal. The
very breadcrumbs were dried
and used for puddings;
scrapings of gravy, scraps of
gristle, fat and vegetables
were boiled with the bones
until every vestige of nutri-
ment had been extracted.
The solid residue was dried
and collected by a cart from
the Munitions Department
for glycerine-making. Scrap-
ings from tables and meat
and bacon cutting-boards
were collected; tea-leaves
and coffee - grounds were
dried and sold for use in
refugee camps. By the end
of 1917 there were no swill-
tubs in our hostels for pig-
farmers ; long before that
the Little Sisters of the
Poor, who had collected
broken food from the hostels
since the commencement of
war, had ceased to call, for
there was nothing left for
rharity when an inch cube of
butter was the weekly ration
and 2oz. of cooked meat the
daily portion. A crust of
bread overlooked in a corner
of the kitchen meant a repri-
mand for the first offence and
a fine for the second. Our
baker, who had supplied me
with fresh bread (less than
24 hours old) in an emer-
gency—an unexpected draft
of 500 men straight from
France—was fined £lO and
costs at Bow-street; he got
off lightly, for the day before
a London club caterer had been fined £lOO
and costs for having exceeded his monthly
batter ration by half a pound.

“Cartot”: The origin of the nautical
“knot ’ goes much further back than sugges-
ted by “X.N.0.” (B. 8/12/’27). The first re-
corded method of calculating distances at sea
was used in Roman naval galleys in the first
century, a.d. A large wheel-like arrange-
ment was attached to the stern of the ship
like a paddle, and at every revolution a slave
dropped a pebble in a box. A knot was tied
in a rope whenever a hundred pebbles had
been placed in the box. From the dimen-
sions of the wheel given by one Roman
writer it would seem that a hundred pebbles,
or a knot in the rope, were approximately
equal to the nautical mile now in use. These
devices, in an improved form, were in use on
Venetian galleys in the Mediterranean as
late as the sixteenth century.

R.C.C.”: Where did the idea originate
that holders of the Victoria Cross are
empowered to turn out a regimental quarter
or other guard, let alone that before Buck-
ingham Palace? My impression is that it
is a privilege that exists only in the,imagi-
nation. In my crowd, the 2nd R.F. of
2!)th Divvy, our first bronze cross was
won by a sergeant on the Houthulst-Poel-
capelle road in October, 1917. The only
time even the regimental quarter guard
turned out for the holder of the coveted
decoration was when he was in charge of

‘‘Sol. M.” : The Australian habit of being
heir to some vast mislaid property is men-
tioned again. The narrative is that one Win-
stanley, owner of the Bramston estate, care-
lessly disappeared 65 years ago. No descend-
ant bothered to ask the proper court to
presume his death, so the rents accumu-
lated in the hands of somebody till the total
is staggering. As part of the city of Lei-
cester appears to stand on the property, this
appears reasonable enough. The heir is said

(JN.cs.W.) en route for the scene of bullion.

“Jobber” : There was no slavish adherence
to schedule time on the trains that left
Temora (N.S.W.) for the Irrigation Area
in the days when I travelled that way.
Barellan was the only town on the line that
boasted a pub, and we generally put in the
better part of half an hour at the station,
there was a joint about 200 yards from the
station where one could get something that
passed for a meal. In the dining-room
the proprietor had reassuringly placed a
large placard on which was written, “Plenty
ol time, my cocky; your train goes at 1.30.”
It generally went somewhere about that time,
out a great deal depended on the thirst of the
travellers. I have frequently seen the guard
go and drag them out of the pub. and some-
umes the driver would obligingly pull up
after going a quarter of a mile to wait for
some bird who had been left at the post.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The Bar, like Caesar’s Ancient Caul, is
mostly split in three,
The leader (if the funds permit it) Mr.
Brass, K.C.,
His junior (two, if gods are kind)
And a patient man who sits behind —-
He briefed and marked the fee.
The senior’s lean and acid, or perhaps a
shade too stout.
He glances at his brief in court and snorts
"What’s this about?”
And then, so fine his fitness is,
He takes the plaintiff’s witnesses
And turns them inside out.
The junior is supposed to know his brief
almost by rote,
Which witness is dependable and which may
act the goat;
<)f every blessed spoken word,
Or incident that has occurred
He makes a careful note.
He brings his senior piles of books and
carries them away
And prompts the great man when he notes
him wandering astray.
The junior sometimes thinks it hot,
But many a K.C. takes a lot
Of prompting on his day !
The work of him who sits behind is mostly
hid from sight.

*Apart from Life Department.
The co. has changed its business from chiefly
marine to chiefly accident; and a fire depart-
ment makes important contributions to the
pool. It took a long time to wind up old
commitments, but the business now appears
to be heading definitely in the right direc-
tion.
Of late years premium income in each de-
partment lias moved in this way:—
Fire. Marine. Accident.
1920 .. £156,657 £381,448 £30,241
1921 . . 149,654 292,834 37,945

1926 . . 36,902 52,875 126,035
1927 . . 45,328 41,023 240,130
The figures make obvious the vigor with
which accident business is now being pur-
sued. The surplus in that department last
year amounted to £30,096 compared with a
surplus of £23,838 and a loss of £9OO for
the two preceding terms. Fire underwriting
showed a surplus of £6912; but the marine
business, which is one of long-winded settle-
ments, continued to register losses-—£9564,
£404.3 and £lO,lBO over the last three years.
Of last year’s marine claims and exes.
(£51,232) no less than £33,820 belonged to
the past. Here is a view of how the busi-
ness as a whole (except the life depart-
ment) has moved :

1922.. 229,537 259,678 95,783 113.2 „ 41.7 „
1923.. 212,701 181,079 84,065 85.1 „ 39.5 „
1924.. 162,577 136,485 64,772 83.9 „ 39.8 „
1925.. 178.664 122,073 72,103 68.3 „ 40.3 „
1926.. 215,812 115,091 78,653 53.3 „ 36.4 „
1927.. 326,481 186,809 112,228 57.2 „ 34.4 „
Considering the general experience of under-
writers last year, the jump in the loss rate is
not surprising. The most encouraging feature
is that during the last two years net pre-
miums have sprung £147,517, reaching
£326,481, and at the same time there has
been a cut of almost 6 p.c. in expense rate,
which, of recent years, lias exhibited a ten-
dency to get out of hand.
Paid capital is £lOO,OOO, and reserves
(apart from life) were £353,449 at June 30,
together equal to 138.9 p.c. of the year’s net
premiums compared with 184.6 p.c. in 1926.
The drop in the ratio is due to the sudden
growth of premium income, but policies are
still well protected. How funds are placed is
seen in the following table, which also re-
flects what has happened in the business since
1920:
1920. 1925. 1926. 1927.

including provision for taxation (1922, £135,118 ;
1925 and 1926, £80,000; and 1927, £40,000).
Excluding odds and ends, over 87 p.c. of the
surplus assets were in more or less liquid
form.
The co. is not pushing its life branch. The
amount of new business written has dropped
steadily from £226,365 in 1924 to £91,896
last year. Income was £28,136 compared
with £31,647 in 1926, new premiums brought
in only £3938, renewals £19,031, annuities,
interest, etc., accounting for the balance.
Claims called for £3343 and exes, ate up
£7481. Assuming that old business cost 7
p.c. of the year’s renewal premiums, then the
new business was costing 158 p.c. The co.’s
outlook is brightening. Its big marine gamble
has given it some nice reserves and an intro-
duction over a wide field, and it is writing a
growing volume of much sounder business
than it used to.

Frederick Levy, who had been tbe A.F.A.’s
inspector for Queensland, got 15,000 fully-
paid ords., but no cash, for promoting this
co.; upon flotation he became its managihg
director. At June 30, 1923, paid capital was
£59,833, of wfjjch £30,426 was represented
by goodwill and establishment expenses. The
cost of opening branches in Sydney and
Melbourne and of share-selling, etc., ac-
counted for £17,730 of it. Recognising the
need for husbanding its resources, the man-
agement proceeded cautiously in the hunt
for business. Here are its performances m
detail: —
1923. 1926. 1927.

Interest, rent, etc. . . 1,427 2,517 2,520
Total income . . . . 11,543 30,396 35,486
The first year's business totted up to
£302,588, and only during the last 12
months has that figure been exceeded. The
average amount per policy last year was
£3OS compared with £299, £325, £287 and
£2Bl back to the beginning.
How much of the business written is
whole-life and how much endowment is not
disclosed, but the Equitable set out to
specialise in probate insurance, and in that
field it has very keen competition. Com-
pared with other forms of policy-writing,
probate business usually means a better pro-
portion of renewals. In this co.’s experi-
ence the renewals have kept above the 80 p.c.
mark, and that is an excejitional figure for a
young office. As against that advantage pre-
mium rates vary from about 6 p.c. to over
15 p.c. below those on whole-life with profits
policies; and, amongst other things, that
pushes up the cost rate a good deal. In this
case, assuming that old business cost 7 p.c.
of the renewal premiums, then last year’s
new business was costing as much as 254 p.c.
compared with 256, 216 and 207.p.c. in the
three preceding years. The exceptionally
high rate in 1926 and 1927 is largely due to
the reinsurance of all accident risks.
Nevertheless, the figures are a clear call to
the management to overhaul the organisa-
tion. Last year the field staff was recast;
new business costs dropped 2 p.c., and a
further reduction is expected during the
current term. The -ratio of exes, to pre-
mium income has indeed been stepping down
quite nicely; it was 81.4 p.c. last year as
against 89.3, 90.8, 107.7 and 164.2 p.c. back
to 1923.
What the liabilities under policies amount
to cannot be stated definitely until the re-
sults of the actuarial investigation now in
progress are made available. Until then it
is not possible to say whether the life fund
—£14,795 at June 30—was adequate. If
it was, then shareholders could see 9s. 7d. of
every £1 they put up in net tangible assets,
which were in this form
1923. 1926. 1927.
Government securities . . £21,199 £3.3,661 £38,161
Mortgages 4,336 9,083
Loans on policies . . . . 526 688
Book debts 1,611 4,874 7,066

Assurance fund . . . . 355 9,693 14,795
Paid capital . . . . 59,833 72,850 72,913
In addition to that lot, policy-holders have
the protection of £54,212 of uncalled capital.
Like other young life concerns, the Equitable
is struggling to establish itself. It is not
possible for a new co. to show an actuarial
profit for many years after business starts,
and until then shareholders, of course, have
to go hungry. Prospects will be largely gov-
erned by the management's ability to cut
costs.
For the last two years the whole of the
accident business has been reinsured. The
102") income was £927. and claims and
exes, called for an additional £79. The
income, however, is said to be growing, and
the co. has decided to again carry the risks
and gather any profit there may be in them.

Extension of the co.’s business in N. >S.
Wales is partly responsible for the recent
jump in figures. For a long time the co.
had the S. Aus. field to itself; but, though
nowadays it has competitors, the trusts
administered have moved in this way:—
1895.. £482,987 1924.. £6,003,151
1905.. 1,413,953 1925.. 6,480,945

1920.. 4,568,146 1927.. 7,775,317
Last year £1,161,635 of new business came
in, but £579,595 of old estates, etc., were
wound up, so the net increase amounted to
£552,040 compared with £712,332 in the
previous year. Commissions have climbed
£8585 in the last two years, reaching
£31,416. Potential earning power has
largely increased, and the future should reap
the benefit.
The £17,905 netted for the 12 months to
Sept. 30 was 9.2 p.c. on total funds (capital
and reserves), and they have to earn only
6.2 p.c. to meet a 12 p.c. distribution. But
what makes the latter look even more com-
fortable is the fact that 31 p.c. of the total
net earnings over the past five years has
remained in the business, making reserves
£93,188 at Sept. 30. Another encouraging
feature is the growing disposition to trust
the trustee cos. Five years ago they
handled only 20 p.c. of the probates granted
in S. Aus.; last year they handled 33 p.c.
Risks are small. The co has the right to
ask for the direction of the Court when it
is in doubt about the interpretation of a
will, and it does not take many chances with
the investment of its own funds, which are
in this form :
1924. 1926. 1927.
Govt, securities and cash . . £49,946 £94,942 £91,294
Advances to estates . . 7,552 11,380 14,772

Mortgages .. .. .. 3,098 8,581 15,303
Sundries 10,059 11,110 11,280
Liabilities are trifling; including £2098 put
by to meet taxation they total £2342.
In its 47 years the co. has never given
out a bonus share. On the other hand, all
new share issues, except the par offer of
1924-25, have been at a premium ; and thus
the 12 p.c. div. is not all that it looks.
Nevertheless the market has expectations
and discounts the future by paying 15s. 6d.
for the £1 shares paid to ss. At that price
the immediate return is a shade under 4
p.c. on a 12 p.c. div. basis. The backing
is 9s. Bd. in net tangibles.

After three years of drift in a current that
was growing stronger, profits have been
headed against the stream. The year’s net
results were £24,673 better at £66,453,
which was 6.3 p.c. on capital compared with
3.9, 7.2, 9.4 and 13.4 p.c. in the four pre-
ceding years. There is a lot of distance to
be regained yet before the management can
feel satisfied with the position, and condi-
tions in the trade are not becoming any
easier eitlxer. The big retailers, who do
their own importing and manufacturing,
have completely altered the complexion of
affairs in Flinders-lane and York-street. To
what extent is partly visible in the casual-
ties and amalgamations amongst the whole-
sale softgoods houses; and the trend of
Robert Reid’s profits since 1920 is further
evidence. The wholesaler is obliged to
carry large stocks and to make heavy for-
ward purchases, and it is with these that
the capricious habits of Dame Fashion and
the price fluctuations of the market have
played havoc of recent years. The amount
paid for goods is something definite to put
into an account; but when prices are on the
down grade, or when a line begins to stick
to the shelves because fickle fancy has
changed, then the figure to be put against
stock becomes something upon which hope
pulls one way and fear pulls the other, and
usually hope is the stronger of the two.
Last year stocks climbed £102,857, reach-
ing £1,212,452; the increase was due to
early deliveries of the new season’s goods.
Yet excepting the 1920 figure the total
was the lowest since 1920. Book debts
(£660.221) are growing steadily; they moved
up £52,464. That might—-probably does —
mean better turnover. Chiefly to meet the
outlay on the new stock the co. went to
its bankers and depositors for an extra
£144,431, making £410,189 at July 19. A
trifle was added to mortgages, and £lB,BOO
was clipped off what was owing to trade
creditors, reducing the amount to £320,787.
As usual, balance-sheet figures disclose a
very comfortable financial position :

There is £150,409 of 0 p.c. mortgage de-
benture stock and interest; taking that into
account the more or less liquid surplus was
a trifle lower at £1,007,000.
Of the £1.059,035 of paid capital the
public is interested only in the prefs.-
200,000 7 p.c. and 250,000 8 p.c.—and last
year’s net profit was nearly twice their
combined annual requirements. Excluding
the depreciation (£34,627) and pensions
(£58,272) reserves the net tangible backing
for the 7 per cents, was a shade over £6,
and after that the 8 per cents, could see a
trifle more than £4 each. The former are
on offer at par, and for the latter 20s. 6d.
is asked.

The past two years have not been quite as
good as their three predecessors. The £25,530
netted for the 12 months to Sept. 30 was
11.6 p.c. on average capital compared with
11.4, 12.9, 12.7 and 12.1 p.c. for the four
years back to 1923. Comfortable returns,
but by no means out of the way considering
the general prosperity and free spending over
the last five years. The slight improvement
last year was the result of better trade;
gross profits improved £6327, reaching
£114,494; but exes, ate up 78.3 p.c. of
the total compared with 77.2 in 1926 and
74.6 p.c. in 1923. Certainly a steady 10 p.c.
has been handed to shareholders since 1917,
and the co. came through the slump of half a
dozen years back without a tremor. Never-
theless, reserves, equal to only 2s. lOd. per
fully-paid £1 share, are not a very substan-
tial prop: to maintain the present dividend
paid capital (£219,114) may need a good
deal more support when the inevitable lean
years arrive. For the most part the co.
handles luxury lines largely on a t.p. basis,
and it does a good deal of its trade on other
people’s money. At Sept. 30 there was
225. lOd. of outside money at risk in the
business for every £1 owned by shareholders.


I'm Asking
THESE LADIES
[FIR THE BULLETIN.]
Under bland heavenly skies
Thais, slim-bodied and fair,
Thais with soft, sleepy eyes,
Thais with tawny bright hair,
Thais the Beautiful, lies.
Does she dream of the desert s bare drouth
And the hot dust that stifles and blinds,
And the clouds that sweep up from the south,
And the sting of the terrible winds,
And a kiss on her mouth?
There is Poppaea, queen of a day
And queen of the legions of dead;
But the light in her eyes is less gay
And sorrow is bound on her head;
And her heart’s far away.
Does she long for a fine curving comb
And the gilt sandals under her feet?
Does this red-haired light lady of Rome
Find the lips of a lover more sweet
Than Heaven’s high dome?
She is white as the moon’s whitest beam
In the garden of stillness and light—
Helen, who worshipped the gleam
Of a blade, and a hilt diamond-bright;
Helen, alone with her dream!
Is she tired for the towers of T roy
For the music and magic and gold,
For a gallant and hot-headed boy,
And the tall armored princes of old,
And a night’s memoried joy?
MAORII.AND.

Two years earlier the amount was 15s. lOd.
Still, shareholders’ risks (for, of course,
they are responsible to the limit of their
capital) have not increased in quite that
proportion, because the chief increase was
£76,500 added to the mortgage (£105,000),
following the purchase of part of Hordern
Bros’, premises in Pitt-street. The co. sold
at the time two blocks that it owned in
George-street, but has not yet gone into
occupation in Pitt-street.

There is nothing uneasy in the financial
position. At Sept. 30 there were more or
less liquids totalling £341,475 to meet lia-
bilities of £179,677, excluding the mortgage.
The chief entry in the sheet 'is a blanket
item: “Stocks, goods afloat and hire agree-
ments under contract, less- unearned interest
and insurance” (£315,759, up £13,669).
Much depends upon those figures, but the
grouping obscures the position. However,
stocks do not appear to have been over-
valued in the past. Provided the evil day
will oblige by keeping out of sight until
reserves have been sufficiently strengthened,
the 10 p.c. to shareholders is not likely to
be disturbed. The market values the scrip
on an S p.c. basis and pays 255. for the
fully-paid shares. The contribs., paid to
155., are on offer at 18s. 6d.

The end of the rich carbonate ore was to
be the end of the Broken Hill mines; then
the sulphides were mastered; next the dumps
were treated for their zinc content; now
there is talk of treating the dump from the
dumps by the Henderson process to get a
little more. An iron mine has also been
discovered in the thousands of tons of
machinery which were scrapped as each new
process came in. Every train to Sydney is
taking away truckloads of it for foundries,
5000 tons being bought up in one lot.

Ardlethan (N.S.W.) finishes its worst
year since its discovery. Drought gripped
it hard, and even in the last weeks, after
Carpathia was up and smiling again, the
Cherry was crying about its water shortage.
Much more serious, though, is its tin short-
age ; its open-cut, from which it hoped some-
thing, will be found very poor. The other
member of the group, the White Crystal, is,
and always has been, almost hopeless.

Westralia’s gold yield for 1927 will be the
lowest for any year since the middle ’nineties
But aided by a resumption of work at the
Golden Horseshoe and the probable expan-
sion of operations at one or two other East-
ern goldfields mines, the State will start next
year with a good deal better prospects than
it did this.

Electrical ore-finders are reported to have
found something at depth in the Boulder
Perseverance (W.A.), but extent and value
have not yet been determined. The “finder”
on this property is said to be the only one of
its kind that is suitable for underground
work, and its admirers declared that it will
eventually prove of great value to the Per-
severance and other cos. that are looking for
lost shoots.
Tin-mining cos. are still being formed in
Adelaide and Melbourne to work deposits in
far-off Pilbara (W.A.). The latest venture
is the Old Shaw, whose experts are stated
to have proved fairly large areas wliich can
be profitably worked by a puddling plant or
gravel pumping. The great trouble is the
shortage of water, and labor and other costs
are staggering.
* * * *
Westralia has just added another to its
long list of dud oil finds. This time a
seepage near Esperance was declared by
Government Geologist Blatchford to be with-
out any geological or other indications of
petroleum. One or two more recent “dis-
coveries” in other parts of the State await
inspection: one “smells of kerosene” and
from another “something like refined oil”
has been taken.
* * *
After hearing why the Tariff Board refused
the request for a bounty on copper produc-
tion, Ivalgoorlie mineowners have practically
abandoned hope of a gold bonus. “Conditions
of mining and treatment of ore are not such
as are conducive to economical production.
.... Such conditions have been abandoned
in other parts of the world for methods
more modern and capable of production at
much low T er costs than are possible under
the methods employed in Australia....
The request for a bounty is tantamount to
asking for assistance to enable the industry
to produce by methods which must be re-
garded as uneconomical if not obsolete”
it all reads like extracts from Royal Com-
missioner Kingsley Thomas’s scathing report
on Kalgoorlie mining methods, with a line or
two here and there from the Federal Expert
Committee’s subsequent condemnation of
Golden Mile management.
* * * *
The value of Kalgoorlie tailings never
seems to grow much less. Most of the
immense piles of accumulated residues have
been treated again and again and are still
said to be valuable. One mountainous dump
on the Boulder is reckoned to contain “hun-
dreds of thousands of pounds” and those
on adjacent properties “nearly as much.”
Horseshoe has just borrowed a further £5OOO
from the State “to try an improved method
of treating Fefractory accumulated tailings
which are expected to give a good result.”
With more Government backing this co.
hopes to resume underground operations and
ore treatment before long. From this it
would appear that the proposed amalgama-
tion of the Horseshoe with Lake View and
Star is off.
* ijc * ❖
Mungana (N.Q.) is not to be allowed to
die as a result of its abandonment by the
Queensland Government. Friday Ahern, one
of the mining identities of the North, and his
merry party of tributors, who took up the
supposed defunct Girofla, have already demon-
strated that they are on velvet, for the
hoppers hold hundreds of tons of beautiful
carbonate ore worth over 30 per cent, lead
and lOoz. silver. The ore body they are
developing is one that was worked by the
late John Moffatt in the early days of the
field, and recent work on this at the 110 ft.
level has disclosed an ore body 120 ft. long
by 10ft. thick with considerable backs:
10,000 tons are reasonably in sight and this
is expected to run 15 p.c. lead and 5 or 6 oz.
silver. The ore is clean carbonate and
easy smelting, and Friday has secured a dis-
used smelter from the Chillagoe works and
is to erect it and smelt at Mungana. The
work merely demonstrates the possibilities
for well-handled private enterprise in this
district. Away from this mine, operations
are disclosing a big and promising lead body
at Redcap. But the rich ore in the. Lady
Jane is apparently lost for ever owing to
the creep around the main shaft.

No less than 14 tin dredges are now under
construction for Sydney-controlled cos., viz.,
Poochong, Kramat,, Serendah, Serendali
South, Rawang Concessions, Had Yai, Huey
Yot, Kampong, Lanjut (2), Ratrut (2),
Takuapa, Katu and Renong ; but not one word
from any of these concerns as to how their
money is holding out. The first intimation
of a depleted exchequer is generally a new
issue of shares, and new issues are not so
easy as they used to be.

Austral Asiatic, a prospecting co. regis-
tered in Sydney, Oct. 1, 1926, had its staff
at work two months later. Several proper-
ties in. the F.M.S., Burma and Siam have
been investigated, but only one subsidiary,
Muang, has been floated to date. Another
property at Tarua is being investigated; a
third, adjoining Muang, is being test-bored;
and options are held over two others at
Renong. Muang brought in £13,300 in fully-
paids and £2900 cash, which with £34 in-
terest, represents income for the year ended
September 30. Exes, ate £7663, and £2500
was struck off establishment account, re-
ducing it to £5OOO, leaving £6071 net. Paid
capital is £20,000 in 800 £25 shares; £966
was owing to creditors, and there was £3127
cash and £18,910 book debts to meet it. The
pontoon for the Muang dredge is expected in
Penang in April, and chairman Joseph Tom-
linson is off to the spot to supervise things
there. Recently it was decided to lift capital
to £50,000.

“Gazeeka” on tin prospects :
“Spare Towkay” seems to infer that the
2,000,000,000 yards of tin ground in the Kinta
Valley, when treated, is likely to affect the price
of tin. The yardage will provide work for 161
years for 50 dredges, each capable of digging
200,000 cubic yards of gravel every 30 days. It
will cost the best part of £6,000,000 sterling to
pay for the dredges and erect them. It takes about
two years from the date a company decides to order
a dredge; and as none of the 50 cos. are yet hatched,
it does not appear that any of the present producers
need get very anxious for another 10 years at least.
By that time the deposits they are now working will
be quite or nearly exhausted. In my opinion the
people who ought to feel alarmed are the consumers
of tin. A world shortage of this commodity is the
surest bet there is.
Some time ago “M.E.” was very anxious about
tin substitutes for canning purposes. This question
was very carefully and painstakingly investigated
under the pressure of the Great War and a high
price for tin. All kinds of likely material were
tried both here and in even- other land that used tin
plate. The result of the Australian inquiry was set
out in the following words: “There is no other
material which possesses all the advantages of tin-
plate.” In peace time tinplate has nothing to fear
as a container for meats, fish, fruits and vegetables.
Mechanical strength is necessary in a food-container
to stand the shocks of handling and transport. For
tropical use there is no argument against tinplate.
Glass containers are used, but only to display their
contents. This form of preserved goods comes within
the category of luxury and appeals only to those
who do not mind the extra cost of the glass packing.
Cardboard containers, after due preparation, will be
used in times of stress, but never in peaceful times.
Few of the substitutes used during the war are
now in use for any but the least valuable of canned
goods; they are now mostly used for powders or sub-
stances not easily affected by moisture. A satisfac-
tory food container must satisfy three demands: —
(1) Strength and durability.
(2) Economy and rapidity of manufacture.
(3) Efficient preservation of the contents.
Tinplate is the only material known to-day which
complies with these three points. That is not to
say that in the future some new malleable alloy of
steel or iron, with either tungsten, molybdenum,
chromium or nickel, or all of them, may not be dis-
covered. But there are two essentials the new
compound will have to supply:—
(1) That the alloy will not be attacked by any
type of food.
(2) That it can be rolled into thin and sound
sheets, suitable for can-making.
Meantime the tin producer should follow the example
of the rubber planter when he hears of another new
synthetic process for the manufacture of rubber.

Some of the Malayan tin dredging returns
for the first half of December show improve-
ment. The Austral Malay group is headed
by Kampong Kamunting, where 72,000
yards yielded 25 tons of tin, average ,831 b.
per yard; the figures for the full month of
November were .751 b. The No. 2 dredge was
hung up for 35 hours for repairs. Asam's
recovery was 14 tons from 20,000 yards,
average 1.621 b. as against .97 for November.
There was a delay hei’e of 131 hours for
screen repairs. Ulu Yam, with 11 tons from
44,000 yards, averaged .601 b. Its November
average was .551 b. Thabawleik was the only
backslider; from 47,000 yards 21 tons were
taken, the average being 1.071 b. against
November’s 1.331 b.

“Tid’apa” : I quite agree with “Towkay.”
It is an open secret in Malaya that quite
ilb. per yard is left behind in the tailings
of the Taiping field. I remember tin
stealers being prosecuted for pilfering the
tailings of one well-known and respected
Taiping co. Why do not shareholders
insist upon having these tailings bored by
independent experts, and avoid the ignominy
of seeing a fortune made from their leavings
by others with more up-to-date methods and
machinery?

Manager Cock, of Londomcontrolled Sela-
yang, is not throwing money about. The
co.’s October costs are announced as £l5Bl,
or 3.58 d. per yard, as against £2216, or
7.18 d. per yard, for Kundang, a few miles
away. The £l5Bl for a full month will take
a lot of beating.

The half-yearly report of Guinea Gold,
about the only New Guinea flotation which
has justified its existence to date, has been
submitted in Adelaide. Paid capital is
£50,000 in £1 shares, of which 19,700 were
issued at par, 17,787 at a premium of £l,
and 12,513 fully-paids went to the vendors
for leases, stores, air service, etc. To repre-
sent the £67,787 of capital and premiums
there were leasehold, £20,624; two aero-
planes, plant, stores, etc., £15,975; cash,
£14,225. Development and preliminary
exes, ate up £24,010, but £4097 from 19490 z.
gold minted and £2950 from the air service
reduced that figure to £16,963. In addition
lOlloz. of gold recently won has not been
included in the above figures. The resump-
tion of gold recovery, delayed by the test-
ing of the lower Bulolo leases, should ease
the position as far as expenditure is con-
cerned. The “Southern leases” are under
offer to a Sydney group, Territories Invest-
ments, Ltd. The idea is to work these pro-
perties with a bucket dredge and a hydro-
electric plant, but before that can be done
the Government will have to build a road.
The aeroplane can’t shift heavy dredge

Aberfoyle Tin, on the South Esk (Tas.),
holds 200 acres and an option over another
40 acres. Work done has proved to a depth
of 60ft. an ore channel 70ft. wide carrying
several tin veins. The manager, of course,
thinks these parallel veins will come to-
gether deeper down, but the directors are
going slowly with equipment until more is
known about it. A compressor with rock
drills and a five-head battery will be in-
stalled to prove the mine before launching
out with a bigger plant. Balance in hand is
only £1145.

Geophysical prospecting may give satis-
factory results in W.A. Ordinary prospec-
tors may not have missed much at points
where they have operated ; but they almost
invariably test elevated ground, where,
owdng to action of air, water and weather-
ing, rocks and gold-bearing ore deposits are
more or less exposed. Except in cases where
spreads of quartz floaters arc noticeable, the
prospector shies clear of flats and valleys,
as, naturally, he does not favor stabbing
through uncertain depths of sand, loam or
cement overburden. It is fairly safe to say
that prospectors have located most of the
gold-bearing ore deposits at elevated points.
On the lower country, however, the field for
a new system of prospecting is long and
wide.

New Guinea Oil announces that, the Home
and Territories Department has, on the
report of its geological adviser, agreed to
subsidise the co., provided, among other
things, core-producing methods are employed
for future drilling. The co. must also carry
on scout drilling by core-producing methods
and further surface surveys. The subsidy
would be payable in respect both of drilling
at the present site and of the scout drilling.

London Australian and General Explora-
tion Co., which once worked several gold
mines in the West and still claims to hold
interests in Australia, issued its annual re-
port the other day. Accounts show a profit,
of £5196. Activities are mainly confined
nowadays to Cornwall and Central Europe,
and the guiding hand is Bewick Moreing.

Company directors and others considered
they had located all the stings in the tail
of the W.A. Miners’ Phthisis Act, but they
had bargained without a perusal of the regu-
lations. One of these provides for the medi-
cal examination of miners, non-resident of
Kalgoorlie, at that centre; leaseholders to
pay the miners’ wages during absence from
their place of employment^
Guinea Airways, Ltd., is making its d£but
in Sydney. The new co. is to take over the
aviation and transport business of Guinea
Gold, which first introduced the aeroplane
to the Bulolo field. Capital is £50.000 in
shares of £1 each, but only 20,000 shares
will be issued for a start. Of these 10,100
f.-p. shares will be retained by Guinea Gol-1.
2400 have been reserved for issue at par to
the co.’s staff in New Guinea, and 7500 are
to be offered at par to shareholders in Guinea
Gold, one to seven.

Richard Teece has at last ceased to be
an officer of the A.M.P. He entered the
service as a junior clerk in. 1886. It
took him only seven years to become
chief clerk; and lie was general manager
from 1890 until, in 1917, he reached
the age of compulsory retirement. An
appointment as consulting actuary retained
his association with the society for the few
months that elapsed before a place was
found for him on the board. His retirement
at 76 marks the close of a bright chapter
in the world’s greatest mutual life office.
The passing of estate-agent Dudley rounds
off one of the
romances ef for-
tunes made of late
years in Sydney
land subdivision.
Dudley was getting
on in the thirties
when he decided,
25 years ago, to
throw up his job
with Farmer’s and
open an estate-
agency at Marou-
bra; and the
scramble for land
in that area brought
him a fortune. The
shopping centre of
a now populous
district surrounding
Maroubra Junction
is Dudley’s Corner.

Stephen Parker, Groperland’s retired C.J.
who died in Melbourne last week at 81,
came near being the first Premier of his
native land. When W.A. secured respon-
sible government in 1890, Parker, K.C.,
and John Forrest were its two outstanding
Parliamentary figures. Nobody else was in
the running for the job of forming the first
Administration. Forrest got the decision,
rather contrary to expectation, for Parker
had family pull besides his professional
eminence. The latter accepted offiae in
Forrest’s Cabinet a bit later, but the rivals
couldn’t row in the same boat. Parker soon
threw up his job, alleging that Bigjohn
“treated his colleagues as subordinates,” and
later on stepped down from the Leg. Council
to contest an Assembly seat in direct oppo-
sition to the ruling faction. Had lie won it
the vendetta might have continued, but
Parker lost and made no further attempt to
re-enter politics. He accepted a Judgeship
shortly after Bigjohn had translated him-
self to Federal politics and rose to be C.J.,
retiring about 12 years ago. Curiously
enough, be preferred to spend the evening of
his days in Melbourne rather than in his
native State, where lie had known such a
long and distinguished career.
Washington Soul, the founder of Austra-
lia’s biggest retail chemist business, wasn’t
a chemist, nor was his early partner, John
Spence. Tile one was a seaman and the
other a shoemaker. In their early days the
trade guffawed merrily at the two inter-
lopers ; but they sold proprietary lines at
prices which the old-fashioned chemists
hadn’t thought of. Thus establishing a
reputation for being cheap, they got a turn-
over which soon supplied them with fine
profits. Quarter of a century ago they
joined up with another live trader, and the
firm became Washington LI. Soul, Pattinson
and Co. Washington Soul, who died last
week, aged 82, had been out of harness for
years ; but his old colleague John Spence is
still the company’s chairman and champion
buyer.
Old hands in Vic. Assembly watch with
great interest Maurice Blackburn debating
bills in the Ministerial corner. Ilis attitude
towards the Labor Government is detached
rather than friendly. On all essential Labor
principles he is with or ahead of his party,
but on other things he is as independent
as, say, Deakin was of George Turner when
he sat in the same locality in the same
House in 1894-99. Blackburn is one of the
real debaters of the Assembly. He pays the
House the compliment of doing research
work and preparing. Sometimes the fluency
be can command is interrupted by a struggle
with himself for the apt word, and he repays
interest displayed in a bright interjection
by a well-turned compliment. Other parties
envy Labor his possession, but Labor does
not appreciate him as much as it would
a more tractable man.
J. N. Parkes, just dead at Townsville
(N.Q.), had 50 years’ continuous service
as secretary of the local Pastoral and Agri-
cultural Show. In the early days of North
and Central Queensland's agitation for separ-
ation from the dominant South, Parkes was
a capable mouthpiece for the Northerners,
as George Silas Curtis was for the Central
district.
G. 11. Kneen succeeds to William Clark-
son’s £3OOO-a-year job on the Commonwealth
Shipping Board. Kneen was assistant gen-
eral manger in London to Larkin, and
since 1922 has been acting manager in
Australia. It is 33 years since he entered
the shipping business. In 1911 as assistant
manager of Vestey Bros., who run the Blue
Star Line, he was associated with the Aus-
tralian trade, and in 1916 he linked up with
the Commonwealth Line.
“The Deacon”: Something new in R.C.
ecclesiastical history happened when John
Isaac finished up at the Cardinal’s College
at Manly (N.S.W.) and was invested with
the collar that buttons from the rear. It is
the first time an Assyrian, whether native
born or otherwise, has been trained in the
Sydney institution. The regulation feast of
the Syrians followed, and Monsignor Dadah
lid the honors in choice Arabic. The
newly-made Melchisedec is off to Banana-
land to save the Syrian souls there.
Llewellyn Jones was a link with the old
art circle whose members, although they sel-
dom sold their pictures, were happy with the
thought that beer was threepence a pint and
the saveloy a cheap food. Fred McCub-
bin, E. P. Fox and John Longstaff were
amongst his fellow-students at the Melbourne
National Gallery classes at a time when he
won the first prize in landscape three times
out of six; but in the ’nineties he found the
art road so hard that he tried to become a
farmer, and subsequently took to commercial
travelling. Of recent years he had found a
much better market for his work. Lie died
in Sydney. A son was taken in the Big
War.
Just ordained Captain Harold Harris,
the new curate of a busy Wellington
(M.L.) city church, was, until recently,
master of the Wellington Llarbor Board’s
suction dredge. During the war, when
charge-officer of an American vessel carry-
ing contraband, he was captured by a Ger-
man submarine and taken to Cuxhaven.
Even peace-time lias had its excitement for
him ; he was second officer on the Wiltshire
when she crashed on the Great Barrier.
Death passed by R. A. Whitfield in
France, and he recovered from wounds at
Bullecourt and gas at Villers-Bret. only to
succumb this week to pneumonia. Younger
son of the late Lewis Whitfield, a Sydney
barrister —connected with the Windeyers—
he broke off his medical course to enlist
in 1916. After the war he joined Dr. Rod-
way at Now r ra, and the pair were busy w’hen
fate dissolved the partnership.
Frank Tate. Victoria’s Director of Edu-
cation, who retires next year after 25 years
in the post, still lingers wistfully near the
locality of his first school at East Kew,
where as a kid of 20 he had 60 pupils. The
attendance to-day is given officially as 650,
and Tate, who lives handy, has a fatherly
interest in the modern brick successor to the
old school-house of his enterprising youth.
All of his children went to the school.

apart as Chile and Servia, and he was for
a time assistant to the great Roscoe. lie
took service with the N.S.W. Government in
1893, but resigned to work on his own
account in 1900. He was a hardy old man ;
eight years ago, when he was 70, he cycled
across to Melbourne and back again. Pro-
fessor Griffith Taylor, the geographer, is one
of the three sons who mourned his death last
week.
John Stokie, who went aloft from Broken
Hill the other day, treasured in his memory
the fact that he once piloted Burke and
Wills. He hopped on to the Thackaringa
mine and, with Paddy Green and others, sent
to England the first ore from the field. Later,
in 1880, he struck the TJmberumberka mine.
Pie died only a few days before reaching his
85th year, and was buried at Silverton, the
field’s first but long-deserted capital.
John Fell, the man who made such a long
and plucky effort to do something with
the kerosene shale of the Wolgan Valley
(N.S.W.) after the Commonwealth Oil
Corp. had crashed on it, is going out
of the oil business after being in it
close on half a century. The British Imperial
Co. has swallowed the whole of the under-
takings of John Fell and Co., Ltd., and, in
view of the size of their competitors, share-
holders in the local concern probably think
themselves lucky to escape with their capital.
It look? as though there is some hard fight-
ing ahead in the oil world. Interests are
being consolidated; thus, in addition to the
purchase of Fell’s, the 8.1. has just acquired
the Australian business of the Tidewater Co.,
an American concern with a big kerosene
connection.
Architect Jack Hennessy evidently struck
the right note in his design for Brisbane’s
new R.C. Cathedral. English professional
criticisms declare that it is one of the best
pieces of work of our generation; and an
American expert describes it as “one of the
best designs of our age.”
Les Rowe, a Digger who was the off-
sider of just-retired Gilder, is pretty sure
to get the job of chief electoral officer of
Vic. He knows the work from A to Z,
and has youth. The status of the office has
been reduced from the first to the third
class; the amalgamation of Federal and
State rolls has reduced its responsibility a
great deal.
For well over half a century Dr. W. A.
Kelly practised at Wingham (N.S.W.). His
last prescription has been written; he
passed out the other day at Prince Alfred
Hospital. So another link has been broken
in the chain of Irish doctors who
came to Australia in the days that have
vanished and nailed up their plates north
of Sydney—Dr. Meredith (Raymond Ter-
race), Dr. Findlay (Stroud), Dr. McNett
(Dungog), Dr. Wright (Gloucester), the
late Dr. A. O. Howse (Wingham), Dr. J.
W. Gormley (Taree, and now living in
Sydney in retirement), the late Dr. Cur-
tayne (Manning River), the late Dr. Boelke
(Port Macquarie), the late Dr. Casement
and Dr. Bagot (Kempsey)..
Yet another of the old Northern contin-
gent has called it a day—J. A. Boyce, a
police-magistrate of the old school and a
Mason of high degree. A Londoner, he
began his work in Queensland as a clerk in
the Colonial Secretary’s office in 1860, and
rose till he had handed out justice in sum-
mary jurisdiction in most of the towns of
Western and Northern Queensland. He re-
tired in 1909 after 50 years’ service. A
notable oarsman in his early days, he was
a prominent member of Brisbane River crews
in the ’sixties. He was 81 at the finish.
The Christian Brothers in Australia lately
lost their one-time Provincial, Patrick Hickey,
who had specialised in education for 45
years. Australian R.C. parents remember
him gratefully, because when lie was at
Strathfield (Sydney) he set out to prevent
lads reaching the dead-end that unskilled
labor leads to. He strenuously advocated
technical education in R.C. schools, and
lived to see it introduced.
“Veronal”: The first vineyard in Victoria
was planted by William Ryrie, grandfather
of the General who is now Australia’s High
Commissioner in London. William Ryrie,
the original owner of Tering station, about
30 miles from Melbourne, got some grape-
vine cuttings from the Macarthurs, of Cam-
den Park, and planted about an acre. By
1886 the Tering vineyard, now the property
of one of the De Castella family—great
vignerons—occupied 100 acres.
Just-dead Westralian ex-Chifef Justice
Stephen Parker was quite at home in the
saddle, and whilst lie was studying for the law
lie made money as a jockey. As his squatter
father regarded the law as a somewhat
degenerate calling, it was necessary for the
youngster to make money; and lie had won
25 races before he became entitled to collect
his crust from Costs.
Lawyers seldom write hymns. The late
Judge Docker, however, had a bookful to
his credit —“Hymns of the Kingdom,” pub-
by Joseph Cook and Co., Sydney, in 1878.
These long-forgotten religious verses are
marked by both piety and scholarship. Some
lines contain fine imagery—
As some dark pool returns with trembling breast
Its broken lights unto their parent star.
The little book is now rare, but David Mit-
chell gathered in a copy.
sE. W. Trend, who will succeed Lemmon,
Minister for Education, as technical schools
representative on Melbourne Uni. Council,
lias won the compliment which has been
paid him ; for eight years he has been presi-
dent of the Footscray Tech. School council.
He is a chemical engineer and manager of
the Lyell superphosphate works at Yarra-
ville. The council can do with a shake-up.
Rev. W. Milne, holidaying now in Aus-
tralia, has an outstanding record in island
missioning. He was born in the Islands,
where his father, one of the missionary
pioneers of the New Hebrides, tilled the
vineyard for 60 years, and died at the age
of 92. The son has put in 30 years on the
same cultivation,
and his sister, who
entered on the
same field, is mar-
ried to yet another
missionary.
M. E. Cantor,
one of the new In-
dustrial Judges in
N. S. Wales, learnt
industrial law in
the office of Cecil
Coghlan, who died
three years ago.
Coghlan was one of
the first of the law
brigade to see the
possibilities of great
profit in arbi-
tration work; and
Cantor, when he
was a mere youth
—he is only 40
now—was his lieu-
tenant on that side.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“A slight misunderstanding in the House of Reps,
led to reports that relations were strained between
Mr. Charlton and Air. Theodore owing to the latter’s
designs upon the party leadership. Subsequently,
however, the pair effectively disproved the story by
lunching at the same table and spending the after-
noon together at quoits.”
They ate the dish of peace, each Labor
brother,
A meal where every forkful squelched the
tale
Of their estrangement—steak that mush-
rooms smother
Or porterhouse which epicures assail —
Pausing occasionally to pledge each other
In beakers of salubrious ginger-ale
As dry as Canberra. And, such exploits
Performed, they amicably fell to quoits.
They sampled, cheek-by-jowl, all grid and
skillet
Could give, and smacked appreciative lip
In turn o’er mayonnaise and juicy fillet.
What better way the calumny to nip
That Theodore was after Charlton’s billet
And meant to elbow him from leadership?
Full-fed, they might have sought some local
Hoyt’s ;
Instead, they played, for all to see, at quoits.
Their tiff was but a momentary friction,
lira amantium —no less, no more ;
As table-mates they tore to shreds the fiction
That each was thii’sting for his comrade’s
gore;
Then arm-in-arm, to deepen the conviction
Of trust renewed, each other off they bore
To be Discoboli. It’s pounds to doits
None but good cobbers ever played at quoits.

"Lp North”: "Quick” mud is a terror
along stretches of the Gulf and N. Territory
coast. It generally occurs in patches of a
few acres, invariably close to mangroves sur-
rounded by a lake of mud.
It has distinctive colors—
light blue, deep blue, white
and black. Areas shadowed
by trees often look decep-
tively firm. Some patches
are a liquid mass in which a
man would go straight down,
leaving only a few bubbles
behind him. But as a rule
the mud is firm enough to
support a man to the thighs,
after which it will gradually
suck him down. Native crews
from the islands, unversed in
buslimanship, have a holy
terror of coastal mud, imagin-
ing that it is filled with vin-
dictive life that sucks a man
down to devils whose bodies
are cloying slime. The worst
death-trap I’ve seen yet is a
patch in the Merauke River,
Dutch N, G. Our cat leapt
overboard and swam for the
near-by shore. She reached
the mud and went slowly
down, struggling and yowl-
ing pathetically.

“D ori c” : The Fijian
natives being like the Ameri-
can negroes, markedly re-
ligious, christen their chil-
dren with Biblical names,
Elijahs and Isaiahs being
common. But I met one tiny
black boy who informed me
that his name was Demos-
thenes, and a tall, thin buck
had the appellation of Hook-
worm. Another idea is to
label children after a white
man who is popular with the parents. There
are “Billsmiths” alb over the group.

“Tesp’’: Can anyone explain the function
of the two white crystal-like substances that

cov’ry an’ got ’em

“Toonooba”: Is there an authentic case
on record of the drowning of a diver by tin
giant clam of the Great Barrier? My
CHRISTMAS GREETINGS.
“Complaints of the season to ’ee, Doctor, an’ plenty of ’em.”
observations on reefs northward from Cairns
convince me that a fair average length for
the mature clam is about 2ft. 6in. It would
be difficult to insert the foot between the
valves of clams of this size because of the
interlocking projections on the lips of the
shells. If by any chance a diver were
caught, a slash with a knife across the hinge
or muscle would cause a severance and the
valves would fall apart. The 4ift. giants
of other waters are, I imagine, rare sped-
mens ; I have not seen any approaching this
size in our tropical seas.

“Bad Australian”: I am inclined to side
with “Bayard’s” cobbers (B. l/12/’27) who
contend that 6ft. is an outsize in tiger-
snakes. During years of wandering in the
waste places of this continent I have seen
hundreds of tiger-snakes, and they rarely
exceeded sft. The 10ft. 4in. skin that “Bay-
ard” saw in the Melbourne bootmaker's shop
was probably that of a carpet-snake; the
similarity in color and marking would easily
mislead an observer with limited experience.
By the way, there may be black snakes in the
Speck, but I never met any. The so-called
“black” snakes of the West Coast are more
like copperheads. “Manuka” (B. l/12/’27)
is unquestionably right in his contention that
they are not “tigers.”

“Mullarula”: Bullockies lack originality

The hundreds of •‘Gilberts” are called after

“Ghalker” is usually white, and “Baldy”
always has a white face. The favorite name

fingers on the other hand. He holds the key
in his teeth, rests the yoke on his shoulder,
slips the bow up with his knee, and then
inserts the key with his hand. And he will
take his team into rough mountainous coun-
try where two-armed men jib on the job.
......
“Nearside Leader”: It would be a poor
one-armed bullock-driver who could not yoke
his own team. Andy Callaghan, of Yale-
bone Creek, Roma (Q.), always yoked up
without assistance, though sliy of an arm.
In his case the bows fitted tight into the
yoke, and the key strings were tied from one
side. Nowadays Callaghan earns his living
making axe-, pick- and adze-handles, and lie
can plait a very fair whip.

“Colorado”: Tell “V.H.R.” (B. 17/11/’27)
that there is no doubt about the preference
of snakes for a fish diet. My first experi-
ence was on the Lower Macleay (N.S.W.),
when I saw an outsize in black snakes of
the red-bellied variety flounder out of the
reeds with a flapping perch about five inches
long in his mouth. Since then I’ve observed
that swampy lagoons are frequented by
black snakes, and in at least a dozen in-
stances have seen them wriggling out with
fish. The greentree-snake often lies in quiet
pools, with only his head and a small por-
tion of the back above water, but he always
shows a preference for frogs,

DREAM TEAMS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Last night along the Castlereagh
The blazing camp-fires shone
In timber belts beside the way,
As in the days long gone.
I saw the flames high-leaping fling
Far shadows through the trees,
And heard the near-by horsebells ring
Old bush night-melodies.
I saw my camp-fire slowly wane,
The yarran red coals glow,
And seated all around again
Were mates of years ago.
Who long had left this earthly track,
Mates wrinkled now and white;
Young men once more I saw them back
Around that fire last night.
We filled our pipes and talking smoked,
We never seemed to tire,
We laughed at sayings old and joked
Beside the dying fire.
When streaky dawn had climbed once more
The Warrumbungles high,
From dank green places o’er and o’er
I heard the brolgas cry.
Then soon our whip-cracks rang aloud.
I saw the stretching chains
As teams in slow procession ploughed
Across the black-soil plains,
Game horses straining all the while
Yet answering each call;
Their wheel tracks linking mile to mile
I saw old wool-teams crawl.
“I VOS GIF YOU ‘CHRISTIANS AVAKE.'"
Though time has cast aside the teams
And turned our hair to grey,
We bring the wool clip still in dreams
Along the Castlereagh.

Is the First Cost the Last Cost?
Just for the saving of perhaps a few shillings men are idle, service is disrupted,
inconvenience, loss of profit—all topped off with the outlook of a heavy repair bill.
It is not so much the first cost that should interest the purchaser, when long life
and freedom from annoying and costly trouble is taken into consideration.
His decision invariably favors the product with a world-wide record of depend-
able performance.

“Up North”: The Torres Islanders were
smoking tobacco when Raleigh was in short
pants. Legends which stretch back for many
centuries frequently refer to it. The weed
is cured by being twisted into ropes and
seasoned among the rafters of the houses;
It used to be smoked in the “zoob,” a big
bamboo cylinder covered with barbaric
designs burnt into the wood. Into the zoob
smoke was puffed until it was full, and this
communal-pipe was then handed around.
Many mainland abos., after a troclius
cruise among the islands, have taken a zoob
and introduced it to their homeland. But the
zoob and the native tobacco are fast dis-
appearing with the introduction of'the white
man’s pipe and ’bacca.
* * * *
“Betul”: If dragon-flies put out to sea
from Maoriland (B. 10/11/’27) they do the
reverse on Cocos Islands. Each year, gen-
erally after the very rare north winds, the
whole atoll will be swarming with them, yet
there is no permanent fresh water anywhere
in which they can pass the larval stage.
When rain falls, and the asphalt paths are
covered with minute pools, the females lay
their eggs, but in vain ; in half an hour the
pools are dried up. The atoll is the only
dry land within many hundreds of miles, and
for one million that land there must be
countless millions lost at sea. These
swarms are not driven to sea by strong
winds; they land of tlicir own accord in
calms of long duration. I have seen them
in great numbers and in dead calms on the
way from Singapore to Brisbane.
# * * *
“Bungaree B.”: “The Welkin” may be
right (B. 24/11/’27) as to the cormorant
preferring to swallow fish with folded fins,
but it is because the bird is crafty—or lazy.
A fish naturally jumps forward; when caught
it struggles for life, and the leap has a tragic
end when it is head-first towards the shag’s
gullet. The bird is a neat tumbler. When
doing the last lap of a long flight he will turn
over and over in his attempt to put on the
brake, and at full speed the swish of his
wings is impressive. One of the reasons
for his unpopularity is his perfume, which
rivals that of the skunk in violence. But
he is a reliable weather prophet; when you
see cormorants flying in V-shaped formations
get out your umbrella and macintosh.
“Prop”: Re the ferocity of the wedge-
tailed eagle, as described by “AdeL.” (B.
29/9/’27) 1 . In our part of N.Q. the trees are
seldom more than 35ft. high, and the eagles
—plentiful here—perforce build fairly close

to the ground. My schoolboy son constantly
collects their eggs. The eagles always arrive
to watch operations, but never interfere.
* * * *
“G. Bung” : Before wireless came in Nauru
maintained communication with Ocean Island
by means of carrier pigeons. Then the frigate
or man-o’-war birds discovered new dainties
on the menu, and the release of a pigeon
became the prelude to a swoop from one of
the black and white pirates. So regularly
did the feathered marauders 'take toll that
the service had to be discontinued.
■t * * <=
“Sea Nomad” : In the long ago, Stephens
Island had no cocoanuts. O: e
day a warrior, when spearing
fish, saw a brown thing rolling
in with the tide. It looked like
the blunt snout of a sabay fish.
He speared it and slung it
ashore. “It’s no pish,” he said,
“it’s no good to kaikai—what
is it good for?” In a spirit of
spite he buried it so that it
should no longer see the sun.
Long afterwards a shoot sprung-
up and developed into a tall
tree bearing green nuts. One
sunshiny morning, while the
warrior was snoring under the
tree, a nut “plopped” within an
inch of his head. Jumping up,
startled, he seized it and
angrily dashed it against a rock.
The nut cracked, and milky
water oozed out. Curiously, the
warrior opened the nut. and
saw the white meat inside.
Being distrustful, he scraped
out some of it and gave it to the
ants, which hurriedly ate it. He
then offered some to the lizards,
which gobbled it. So lie tasted
the milk, and then drank it
freely. Quickly also he ate the
white meat, and declared the
nut “good feller kaikai.” Every-
one then planted a nut, and now
Stephens Island grows many
cocoanut-trees.
“Caloo”: During the native-bear slaugh-
tering season in Queensland the pelts of
the unfortunate animals were used as a
medium of exchange. In Rockhampton I
saw a hotelkeeper pass over a dozen bottles
of thirst-quencher for a bundle of bearskins.
When I asked if he were saving them up he
was amused. .“Why,” he said, “you can buy
almost anything up here, from a tram-ride
to admission to the flicks, with a bearskin.”
“The Rumpus”: I can bear out "Bootle
Lasoelles’s” description of the sea pike (B.
17/11/’27), which flashes through waters
other than those of Northern Bananaland.
At Flinders Bay (W.A.) I have hooked two-
pounders which furnished a great meal, and
have seen 4ft. specimens come like arrows
from under reef-ledges and leap their full
length out of water to reach a low-flying gull.
This is an impossible feat for other fish to
attempt, but the speed and impetus of the
pike, coupled with the dog-like, tooth-lined
mouth, makes its performance an easy matter.

“John H.”: Some curious conveyances
have been used by rabbit-trappers in the
western N.S.W, to carry bunny to the freez-
ing-works. Queerest of all was an old han-
som-cab. The owner drove up to the works
in great style, and opened the doors from
his seat with a flourish. The seat had been
removed, and bunny was strung upon sticks
fastened crosswise within.

“Lauda” : The N.S.W. Naturalists’ Society
has asked the local-government bodies for
an opinion as to whether th,e native-bear
feeds on mistletoe. It is contended that
butchery of the little fellows has assisted
the spread of the forest-destroying curse.
Verified facts bearing on this point might
make the authorities take notice, and thus
prevent a repetition of the recent massacre
in Queensland.

“S.J.M.” : If “Bayview’s” lady of the sea-
gulls (B. 20/10/’27) happened to reside at
Bowen (Q.) she would find the task of
carrying rations to the beach unnecessary.
There, during the daytime, the birds desert
the seashore for the pub back yards, where
they contend with the chooks for food-
scraps ; their fishing—if they indulge in it
at all—is confined to the hours of darkness.
Yard-men make occasional but utterly futile
attempts to shoo them off the premises.
Which reminds me that I have not yet seen
or heard of anyone shooting or otherwise
destroying one of these birds. I have wit-
nessed “sportsmen” murder nearly everything
that flew, walked or climbed, from Willv
Wagtail to Billy Bluegum. but never a gull.
What causes the exemption? Is it super-
stition ?
# * * *
“Malo” : The white ants’ mud hut is put to
many uses. Goannas frequently take posses-
sion and rear a family in it. while porcupines
find it a snug nursery, board and lodging
being provided. Parrots, notably the golden-
winged and hooded varieties, tunnel and nest
in the mounds, braving the lizards which
often feast upon their eggs and young. This
practice accounts for the scarcity of the tur-
quoise parrot, now almost extinct.
WHEN THE “GIPPSIE" DASHES
THROUGH.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Electric trains unheeded flash by me on my
rounds
Of drab suburban highways wherein I toil
each day ;
But when the locomotive her piercing whistle
sounds,
It strikes a chord responsive within my
heart alway.
Tis like a long-drawn coo-ee from some far
Gippsland range,
A breath of musk and hazel, from scrub-
lands wet with dew,
Seems borne upon the breezes, like incense
sweet and strange;
All town things are forgotten when the
“Gippsie” dashes through.
Green grass supplants the pavement, green
trees the buildings tall;
In fancy I'm transported to timbered lands
afar,
Where, on some rugged hillside, the mea-
sured axe-strokes fall,
Beyond the sloping foothills of Morwell
and Yinnnr.
Upon the swaying springboard a lithe young
axeman stands,
The chips again are flying, as years ago
they flew ;
That lean bush-bred Australian, his keen axe
in his hands,
I always seem to see him us the “Gippsie”
dashes through.
Mayhap some other watcher, who knows and
loves the hills,
Is borne away, in fancy, on that departing
train,
To gullies where the fragrance of wild
boronia spills,
And coachwhip-birds are sounding their
strange wild notes again ;
Perhaps the fern-fronds waving, the gum-
leaves rustling low,
May sound an invitation acquaintance to
renew
With places once familiar and scenes of
long ago,
That leap again to mem’ry as the “Gipp-
sie” dashes through.
The “Sale and Bairnsdale,” speeding to-night
with lights agleam,
Shall dash past settlers’ homesteads, on
hillsides far away;
Urged by a force dynamic, the magic pow’r
of steam,
No grade her speed shall slacken, no hill
her course will stay.
The splitters, by their camp-fires, shall watch
her speeding past,
And mark the gleams of brightness her
lighted windows strew ;
The sleeping towns shall waken, where rings
that piercing blast,
The whistle’s vibrant warning as the
“Gippsie” dashes through.
INEXPERIENCED.
MUM: “I’ve sent ’Erbert to bed without his tea for telling me a lie.”
DAD: “Don’t be too ’ard on ’ini. Th ’ -poor kid’s not old enough yet to put over a good
tale.”
Oli, Gippsland, vast and primal, each long
and grassy reach,
Each tree-bestudded mountain retains its
old appeal;
From where the ocean rollers break on Ivil-
cunda beach
To Baw-Baw’s range majestic, capped by
its snow-white seal.
Romance still spreads its glamor o’er
Buchan’s fairy caves,
It hovers o’er the ranges from Foster to
Mirboo;
And ’tis Romance, in passing, a mystic wand
that waves,
To call the rovers homeward as the “Gipp-
sie” dashes through.

WHEAT VARIETIES IN VICTORIA.
“Villers-Brett.”: Over 200 varieties of
wheat were sown in Victoria for the current
harvest. There were only 52 varieties sown
to aggregate areas of 1000 acres and over.
Federation heads the list, representing
38 p.c. of the total area sown. Then come
Currawa and Ranee with a percentage of
nine and six respectively. Nabawa, a variety
which, on account of its immunity to rust, is
expected to become more popular when it is
better known, is 29th on the list, with an
area of 5.376 acres. In the Mallee, Cur-
rawa is favorite with a percentage of 20,
and Federation with 14 p.c. is second. In
the Wimmera 64 p.c. of the wheat sown is
Federation, while Gallipoli is next with seven
p.c. In the Northern districts 59 p.c. of
the area is Federation. The next is Turvey
with 12 p.c. In the North-East 26 p.c. is
sown to Federation, while.lB p.c.’is Turvey.
Down Gippsland way Mayor is a strong
favorite, with a percentage of 75, Federation
and Wannon coming next. In the Western
district Federation and Turvey take the
places with percentages of 52 and 19 res-
pectively. Wheats that are progressing by
leaps and bounds since their introduction
to the Mallee are the Indian crossbreds—
Ranee and Rajah. They are third and fifth
on the list of varieties preferred for the
Mallee, and it appears quite probable that
their position on the list will be higher next
harvest.
THE MALLEE FARMER’S HAY CROP.
“Glenfield” : The Mallee cocky who desires
to work his block to its fullest producing
capacity is advised to sow oats on fallow for
the hay crop and usually a clean and dense
crop of oaten hay can be harvested. The
whole of the previous year’s wheat stubble
can then be sown with oats as forage for
the sheep, thus increasing the sheep-carrying
capacity of the block. This seems to be the
ideal the Mallee man should aim at; but the
method is applicable only to blocks of 800
acres or more.
For most efficient farming under Mallee
conditions the 640-acre block is too small.
Most Mallee farmers will agree that 200
acres of fallow is a necessary minimum for
the wheat crop ; therefore there is no fallow
to spare for oats on blocks of this size.
The best plan for the 640-acre man is to
sow his 200 acres of wheat-stubble land with
oats, half for hay and half for forage. Six
years out of seven he will grow sufficient
hay for the year’s requirements and also get
sufficient to build up reserves for the dry
years.
I favor the Algerian oat for forage. It is a
good stooler, and by the time the sheep have
cleaned up the summer fallow the oats have
made a good body of growth. This oat also
stands feeding off better, and comes again
with more body after a spell from the sheep.
It is best to sow the forage oat crop in
March, rain or no rain.
GOULBURN WHEAT-GROWING.
“Ekib” : It is quite possible that Goulburn
(N.S.W.) may become the centre of a suc-
cessful wheat district. Efforts have been made
in a small way to grow wheat previously, but
they have all failed. It was said that wheat
grown here was too hard in the skin, but
varieties now grown will change this. H.
Friend and B. Diehm, of Ivelburn, near
Goulburn, in May and June sowed, with
tractor-power, 800 acres of wheat. This is
almost ready to harvest now, and a yield of
6000 bags is expected, as the crop gives
great promise. Power-driven reaper-thresh-
ers, the first of their kind in Goulburn, will
be used to take off the crop.
GOATS AS WEED-KILLERS.
“Azac”: A Taranaki (M.L.) farmer, evi-
dently unaware of the not altogether success-
ful methods devised by scientists for ridding
the country of weeds, set about the job in
the following manner. The* farm (about
150 acres) was purchased for a mere song
because of its filthy condition —It was over-
run with blackberries, bracken fern, gorse,
etc. The area was temporarily divided into
about a dozen paddocks. Cattle were put
into the first paddock to eat out all the long
grasses and herbage that had managed to
keep growing amongst the weeds. As feed
for the cattle was scarce in the paddock
they trampled down much of the weed growth
in fossicking for enough to keep the wolf
from the door. When the cattle refused to
eat anything further, they were transferred
to paddock No. 2. Sheep followed the cattle
in paddock No. 1, and these cleared up any
growth which proved too short for the
larger stock, and as this was not altogether
plentiful they tackled some of the weeds
and the more succulent growth on the black-
berry vines, in addition to trampling down
the bracken fern still further. When the
cattle had completed their shift in No. 2
paddock they were put in the next paddock
and the sheep took up duty in paddock No. 2.
Goats, purchased specially for the job at
about nothing per head, took up the good
work in paddock No. 1 when the sheep were
moved on. Their choice of menu consisted
of weeds, blackberries, or death. They proved
wise and tackled anything that offered rather
than death, and it was not long before the
paddock looked as inviting as a cricket
pitch.
A rough raking up, and burning of the
trampled-down bracken, etc., made a pretty
good job of it. When the whole dozen pad-
docks had been worked in this fashion, the
temporary fences were removed, and the
stock (goats, sheep and cattle) allowed to
graze at large over the whole area. If the
weed growth was noticed to recovering
on any particular spot a temporary fence
was run around it and the goats were con-
fined there until the weeds had had enough.
The cost of clearing amounted to nothing,
while the land appreciated greatly in value.
ABOUT SOILS.
“Mora”: The principal component parts
of the soil, whatever may be the color, are
clay, lime, sand, water and air. The primi-
tive earths, argil, lime and sand, contain each
in perhaps nearly equal degrees the food of
plants ; but in their union the purposes of
vegetation are most completely answered.
The precise quantities of each necessary to
make this union perfect are best deter-
mined in practice, when the soil proves to
be neither too stiff nor adhesive from a
superabundance of clay, nor of too loose and
weak a texture from an over quantity of
sand in its composition. The medium is
undoubtedly best, but an excess towards
adhesion is obviously most safe.
A stiff or strong soil holds the water that
falls on it for a long time, and being cap-
able of much ploughing is naturally well
qualified to carry the most valuable arable
crops. A light sod, or one of a texture
feeble and easily broken, is on the contrary
soon exhausted, and requires renovation by
grass, otherwise it cannot be cultivated to
advantage.
A clayey soil, while distinguished by the
color which it bears, differs from all other
soils, being tough, wet and cold, and conse-
quently requires a good deal of working be-
fore it can be sufficiently pulverised to give
good results. Clay land holds water like a
cup, and once wet does not soon dry. In
like manner, when thoroughly dry it is not
soon wetted. If ploughed in a wet state it
sticks to the plough like mortar, and in a
dry summer the plough turns it over in
great clods scarcely to be broken by the
heaviest roller.
Sandy soils are managed with a good deal
less trouble, but at the same time the crops
produced from them are generally of smaller
value. There are many varieties of sand as
well as of clay, and in some parts of Aus-
tralia the surface is little better than a bar-
ren sand-waste, where introduced plants will
not take root unless a dose of clay or good
.earth is previously administered. This is not
the soil I suggest when referring to sands.
The soil meant is one where the sand is pre-
dominant, although there*be other earths in
the mixture. Containing, a great quantity of
sand, these soils are loose and crumbling, and
never get into a clod, even in the driest
weather. A sandy loam, owing to the clay
that is in it, does not crumble down, or be-
come loose like a real sand, but retains a
degree of adhesion after rain or drought,
notwithstanding the quantity of sand mixed
with it.
A true sandy loam on a sound sub-soil is
the most valuable of all soils. The real sands
are not favorable to the growth of wheat,
unless when preceded by clover, which binds
the surface and confers a temporary strength
for sustaining the grain.
WHEAT AND THE PLOUGH.
“Boronia”: The reasons given by “Leo
Lear” (B. 3,/11/’27) for the diminishing
wheat yield are perfectly sound; but he is
in error in assuming that this applies to wet
localities only. As a matter of hard fact,
the yield in dry areas shows the same falling
off. Here the question of inferior drainage
due to modern methods of ploughing can-
not be cited as a contributing factor; noj
can the seed be blamed, as its drought-
resisting qualities are well developed. But
it’s still a matter of the method of ploughing.
Successful farmers in dry districts claim
that for the first three years it matters
little which type of implement is used; but
after that, when the weeds start to take a
hand in the game, the use of mould-board
ploughs invariably results in greater yields.
The reason is that discs cut and spread
weeds and fail to cover them, thereby actu-
ally assisting in the propagation of the pests,
while the mould-board plough cuts off and
completely buries them. Thus the humus
content of the soil is increased, and with
a greatly reduced weed growth most of the
available moisture goes to the crop.
CULTIVATING LUCERNE.
“Biro” : To establish a paddock of lucerne
requires energy. The land should be suitable
and well manured. It should be culti-
vated again and again so that the soil will
be fine enough to set well down and give the
young plants firm footing. Once established,
it is the grower’s fault if lucerne does not
make headway. It should be given a good
start before stock are turned on to it, but
if required to be cut for hay or ensilage
stock should never be allowed on it. The
more level and smooth the surface can be
kept the better. After about three months
the lucerne should be cut. It may be only
eight or nine inches high, but it should be
cut close to the earth. The stems will
thicken and sprout, and the crop should
always be cut at the same level in future.
Thus the same stems will last and form
what lucerne-growers call “a crown” each
time, economising time and moisture and
keeping tough stems out of the hay.
When cutting for pressing a side-delivery
reaper can be used with advantage and the
hay can be placed directly into the press
from the windrows. Should the hay become
damaged or discolored it is a good plan to
make ensilage of it by mixing layers of good
hay alternately with it in a shallow pit,
which should, of course, be well covered and
earthed oyer. It should be cut when about
to flower for preference.
POINTS OF THE DAIRY COW.
“Yufu” : The following hints will help the
novice cow-cocky in the choice of good,
sound cows.
As the average cow is on her decline after
her twelfth year, it is as well to ascertain
her age. This can be done by counting
the rings on her horn and adding three.
Thus, three distinct rings means that she
is rising seven. If the horns are filed, beware
of her.
Then comes build. The hips should be
broad and square, the shoulders tapering
and narrow, the chest wide and deep. The
barrel wants to be long and concave, the sign
of a good breeder. The hind legs should
be wide apart, the crutch as low as, if not
lower than, the brisket. The neck should
taper near the head.
Very important is the cow’s expression.
Her forehead should be broad, with the eyes
set wide apart. She should appear placid
and contented. Beware of the beast that
holds its head high when anyone approaches
it; such nervousness is always damaging to
milk yield.
A good cow’s coat should be short, fine
and clean. The bush of her tail should be
crinkly and fine. The escutcheon wants to
spread well up the fork and curl over widely
on each side.
A wide, scoop-shaped udder spreading well
along a beast’s belly is preferential to a
pear-shaped, low-hanging one. The latter
type nearly always has large teats, which,
b§ing so low down, are liable to be
ripped. In any case, the teats should be
wide apart and of a size easy to handle.
The milk-vein along the belly should be
as thick as a finger, and it should be remem-
bered that a good dairy cow waddles rather
than walks.
The safest dairy breeds to choose from, I
would say, are: Shorthorns, Ayrsliires, Jer-
seys and Holsteins. Guernseys, in my
opinion, are too susceptible to tuberculosis.
For a hard-doing, good-milking, good-testing
cow, the Shorthorn-Jersey cross takes a lot
of beating.
CIIAMriON MILK WELLS.
“Wire”: The Australian champion cow
Dominion lona, a Friesian, produced 116 Jib.
of milk in 24 hours. A cow-cocky in Mort-
lake (Vic.) has a Friesian-Ayrshire cross
which returned him £36 in the year (certi-
fied). She filled a 12-gallon can in 24
hours, thus exceeding the official record, but
he was ignorant of the fact that he pos-
sessed a record-breaker. She is now just
nine years old. and marred by recurring
mammitis. Her owner’s greatest wish is
for a heifer calf, but all her seven calves
have been of the male persuasion.
MILKERS’ RECORDS.
“Wob”: In answer to “Milker” (B.
l/12/’27). To milk a dozen cows is above
the average. Two points enter into the ques-
tion —the class of cow and whether the
milker does his own bailing up.
The cows I own, not a v-ery good class,
on fair country yield on an average four
quarts. With a bailer-up I have milked 15
in an hour. As some ,cows yield 10 quarts
and others only two parts, the quantity of
milk yielded ought to be taken into account.
A man doing his own bailing-up with a good
class of cow is doing well if he puts through
six in an hour.
CONCRETE IN THE DAIRY.
“P.M.”: Every milking-shed should have
a concrete floor. It should be all in one
section, since battens allow manure to get
into the joins and form a breeding-ground
for germs and emit bad odors to taint the
milk. The floor should be finished rough ;
one of cement, two of sand and four of
screenings or quart-gravel is a good mixture.
A top-dressing would make the floor too
smooth, and after a shower of rain cows
would fall down and break their legs.
The separator-room floor, on the contrary,
should be as smooth as possible, so that all
spilt milk and cream can be washed off, and
the chances of tainted cream lessened.
Another use for concrete is in pig-troughs.
The old-style pig-troughs are roughly hewn
out of logs, and sour milk, potato-peelings,
etc., collect in the crevices. I have seen
wooden pig-troughs that were bad enough to
put even a pig off his tucker. A smooth-
finished concrete trough is much healthier
and more durable.
MORE ABOUT BABY BEEF.
“N.M.L.” : I’d be obliged if some of those
who prate of baby beef, “Furphy” included,
would let me know how it is to be produced.
Big cattle-stations can’t market it —that’s
positive. In Bananaland, the cattle-stations
have been pushed back and back, on to the
poorer and drier country, till they’re either
breeding on rubbish or are so many miles —
or hundreds of miles—from the railway that
baby beef isn’t even a dream with them. On
some of the sweeter properties on the out-
side edge it’s possible to produce prime beef
in an 18-month-old steer. But it's no use
out there. And “Furphy” and others can
take it for granted no buyer is going to lift
young stuff like that for a long journey to
the trucks and a longer railage to the coast.
Even when the prices of cattle were good,
and when buyers would take almost any-
thing in hides and horns, they wouldn't
touch cattle under two and a half years old
in W.Q. There were odd exceptions to this
rule—So rare that they’re not worth men-
tioning.
If anyone is going to market baby beef
it must be a man in an agricultural
district where he may stuff rich feed
into his stock. But country which will
grow lucerne is too valuable to devote
to breeding cattle. Admittedly, it should
not be; but the fact remains that under
our system it is. Is that man going
to buy weaners from the breeder, drove and
truck them to his property, and then pro-
duce baby beef? Travelling exes, about 30s.
a head; loss about 5 per cent, to 10 per
cent.; inoculation for tick fever and
pleuro ; costs of fodder; handling and a hun-
dred other incidentals make it impracticable.
BEEF RAISING IN BANANALAND.
“N.M.L.”: “Dalgonally” (B. 17/11/’27i
has made a brave attempt, but lie hasn’t put
his finger on the weak spot in Banana-
land’s beef-raising industry. High taxation
and other things which lie mentions certainly
are a factor in the depression, but the foolish
system of letting London parity control
local prices is the nigger in the woodpile. In
our best exporting years we didn’t ship more
than about 20 p.c. of our beef, and yet we
let the tail wag the dog by making the ex-
port price the ruling price for whole
output! In reference to McCormack’s pan-
acea of imported high-class bulls, after the
good prices from 1914 on to the ’2l seasons
many places bought higher-class bulls than
they’d ever seen before. I was right in the
track of all cattle going to the back country
then —where the big cattle-stations and
majority of our beef dwell—and I know that
there was never such a lavish buying of bulls
as that period produced. Those bulls must
have improved the quality of the cattle,- but
what was the result? The scrub-rubbish
that was bred previously brought up to 40s.
a hundred on trucks, and when the progeny
of the importations came to face the . market
they brought from 12s. 6d. to 15s. a hundred.
What’s the use of “Dalgonally” talking
of the necessity of ring-barking as a means
of improving cattle when there isn’t enough
timber to provide fencing-posts on tens of
thousands of square miles of the best cattle
country? “A bullock cannot be marketed
till he is 41 years old,” he says. From
stations I was managing on the Barkly table-

A CHRISTMAS STORY.
(The author apolegises to his Readers
for moving them to Tears, hut this is
Christmus .)
It was Christmus Eve in the Workhouse,
but that was not the only Place where
hearts were Unhappy. Poor little Sammy
Wilkins had wakened up in the morning and
Preyed that he might be given a ne’er Gun
for a Christmas Prescent.
But, allars! Sammy’s parents were poor.
His Father had been out of Work for weeks,
and he had no money and it was because
there was no brekfust that the trubble began.
Sammy’s father must have been irrertible
because, when lie’s wife spoke to him, he
swoar at her; and when she Spoke again, he
threw the calving knife. She fell in a
Welter of Gore, and the Murderer fled from
the house.
So did Sammy, crying biterly. He knew
his father was not really a bad man, but
was a Victim of Circiimstanses. He felt
that he could not tell anyone that he had
Murdered his mother. So when lie met
Billy Jones, he pretended that nothing had
happened, and played with him as usual.
But every time Billy told him what he
was going to get for Cliristmus his heart
ached with the thout of his own trubbles.
Suddenly a moter-car sped round the Corner
of the road, just as Billy and Sammy were
dashing across. There was a Shreek and
then All was Still. One poor nearly lifeless
Body lay Battered on the ground, and the
other stood Near, Apalled.
Mr. Wilkins wandered the Town dis-
trackcdly, full of Remorse for his Fell Deed
in killing his wife. He wondered what
would become of Sammy, but it was no use
his waiting to be Hung.
Mr. Wilkins was really a good man, but
years ago he had quareld with his Father,
who was one of the Richest Men in the
country. Fate had been against him; and
now he had Murdered his wife in a Fit of
Temper. And it was Christmus Eve, he
reflected, bittelly.
He made up his mind that he would throw
himself into the Harbor and End it all. He
could no longer endewer it. Just as he was
about to do the Deed he felt in his pocket.
There was just a penny there, so he bought
a paper.
*‘Oh, Hevens! this is the Last strawer!”
lie cried, bittelly, as his Eye Fell on the news
of the terrible Accident. The Paper said that
a boy named Sammy Wilkins had been taken
to Hospital in a Dying Condition.
If he went to Hospital to see his son in
his Dying hour he would be arrested and
Hung. But he might just as well. With a
heavy heart he set out. His Cup of Unhap-
piness was Full to the Brim.
He was asking at the Gate about Sammy
when a voice at his elbow caused his heart
to Sink. So already the police were on his
Trail!
But No!
He gave a cry of joy, for there was his
Hardharted Father, liis dear Wife, who he
thout was dead, with only her Arm tide up,
and Sammy, with a bandage round his head.
“It was all a Mistake,” said his Father.
“I was feeling lonely, with Christmus coming,
and sorry for being so Hard to you, and I
was rushing to your Home when my car ran
over the poor boys. The other boy is dead;
but it was a mistake of the paper which said
that it was Sammy who was badly ingered.”
“And you didn’t Murder me,” said his wife,
smiling happerly. “You only stuck the Knife
through my arm, and I Fainted. I know
you only did it because you were worried.”
“It was all my fault for being so Hard-
harted,” said his Father remorsfly. “But I
will make Amens. Take this, my boy, as a
Christmus Present.”
So saying, he handed him a Check for a
milion pounds.
The Banks were closed, but the man where
they bought the Turkey reddily cashed the
THOUGHTFUL.
WIFE: “Mother says she’s made up her
mind to he cremated.”
HUBBY: “Good, I’ll go and order a taxi.”
Check when he saw who had signed it.
So, after all, everybody was happy when
Christmus morning Domed, even Billy Jones,
who was an Orfen, but had always gone to
Sunday-school and was in heaven.

lands I used annually to turn off the whole
draft at from 2-i to 31 years old. In fact,
that was the sale age throughout the district.
After walking 100 to 150 miles to the trucks,
and railing over 600 miles to the works, they
used to average from 5901 b. to 6201 b. Those
works were at Townsville, not at Brisbane,
where “Dalgonally” seems to imply all bul-
locks must go. He then figures that a breed-
ing cow, turned off at 64 to 7 years old,
stands her owner in £7 los. and is sold at
£5 10s., a loss of £2 ss. But what’s a breed-
ing cow for? If she’s been used for her
legitimate purpose for four or five years,
aren’t her progeny worth anything? In-
stead of turning off on age, how about turn-
ing off shy breeders, irrespective of age,
every year? A good breeder that throws a
calf every year is an asset to the station
far above her value in beef. It’s the cow
which only has a calf every two or three
years which is the drag on a property.
They’re easily picked. When a man’s taking
his draft of fat bullocks any cows which
run to fat and not to calf should go with
the fats to the works or market.
GRASS SEEDS AND SHEEP.
“Azac” : “Be sure that you shear before
grass seeds appear” is a proverb that it is
seasonable to quote just now. Grass seed
injure not only the wool, but also the
sheep, and each year some sheepmen are
troubled by a mysterious complaint that
takes heavy toll of the flock after dipping.
Not that the obscure complaint is totally
absent where sheep are not dipped, hut the
dipping seems to favor the development of
the disease.
A theory exists among .some vets, that
the disease—many pastoralists refer to the
complaint simply as “lameness” —is either
caused by, or at any rate accentuated by,
the penetration of the skin of the sheep by
grass seeds. The punctures are made in
the skin by the seeds, which in many cases
may carry disease germs which infect the
blood and so give rise to abscesses similar
to those found under the skin of affected
sheep. It may be either these abscesses
forming at the joints or merely the soreness
caused by the penetrating seeds that makes
the sheep go lame. Death eventually results
from a form of blood poisoning.
Dipping, as previously remarked, accentu-
ates the trouble. This can be explained as
follows. The moisture in the dip causes
the seeds which are sticking through the
skin to swell and enlarge the punctures,
thus causing acute irritation and pain. The
dip itself, being poisonous, would perhaps
cause death in some cases, while the seeds
which have almost completely worked their
way through the skin might germinate under
the skin when they are moistened by the
dip, with dire results. Moreover, most
germs giving rise to disease —there may be
millions of them on dirty grass seeds —
require a certain amount of moisture before
they are able to multiply, and, by dipping,
the sheepman might be unconsciously sup-
plying just the moisture required.
Sheepmen have been advised to swim
badly seed-infested sheep through a dip of
fresh water in order to loosen the seed.
Before accepting such advice it is best to
consider the harm that might be done, as
explained above.
COMPARATIVE WOOL VALUES.
“Trepex” : Surely not even the most con-
firmed exponent of fine-wool growing can
have failed to notice the present tendency
in wool values. A few specialty lots of
superfine quality bring outstanding prices,
but they are from the most favored districts
and have to be of first-rate style and con-
dition. Many fine faulty wools are selling
at disappointing figures. The most general
demand is for the big well-grown wools of
medium and medium-to-broad quality. The
Japs, who are the biggest factor in the
Sydney market at present, are buying more
broad merino stuff than anything else, and
are taking a bigger proportion of comebacks
and merinos than ever before. The Russians,
too, who were expected to take almost ex-
clusively the finest merinos, are lifting big
weights of the more robust, warpy staple.
At recent Sydney sales a stylish southern
clip was offered. It has been bred so far
from the crossbred which it used to be that
about half the clip was classed as merino.
Quite a good merino quality it was, too.
Yet not only did the comeback portion
realise a higher average price all round, but
it brought the top price. In the same
catalogue two merino clips from the Young
district were offered side by side. One had
been bred from South Australian rams, and
was a big well-grown broad wool; the other
was bred from finer studs and was of nice
fine-to-medium quality. There was only a
wire fence between the two properties on
which the clips were grown, but the best of
the broad wool brought lid. more than the
best of the finer stuff, and averaged con-
rdderably better.
Gan woolgrowers afford to neglect evi-
dence such as this? It is noticeable that
even such critics as Harry Dawson are
beginning to realise that, although we have
sacrificed some of our fine quality, we have
added a good deal in density and style which
has not yet been equalled by the South
Africans, and Mr. Dawson annoyed the Cape
woolgrowers by telling them so. Overseas
buyers operating in our markets admit that
on results our policy has been justified.
mating long-woolled rams.
“Saaedi” : Long-wool rams are sometimes
rather reluctant about attending to their
duties. If the weather is warm, and the
rams are fat. it is a most difficult matter
to keep them with the ewes. This is more
particularly the case if the males are carry-
ing heavy fleeces. When long-wool rams are
mated in any of the warmer months it is
advisable, where practicable, to shear them
about a month before they are to take up
their duties. Heavy feeding should be
avoided, and, if all else fails, rams and ewes
should be yarded every night. This will
usually have the desired result, though, on
account of the knocking about, involved for
the jumbucks, is to be avoided if possible.
FLEECE-HANDLING FOR AMATEURS.
“B-Gar”: After the sheep lias been shorn,
carefully gather up the fleece, throw it flesh
side upwards on the rolling-table, and skirt
off all the rough edges, locks and stained
pieces. Then turn the sides well in towards
the middle of the fleece, throw over the
britch end. and likewise the neck. Roll the
fleece neatly, from the britch end first, and
tie with a piece of wool. (Do not use
string; buyers object to it.) Place the
fleece in its bin, according to the quality,
strength, character and condition of the
wool, and it is then ready for baling.
In small flocks, the amateur classer should
not make too many different classes; in a
merino flock three will be ample. Bellies
must be kept separate, and the skirtings
sorted into first and second pieces, stained
pieces and locks. In a crossbred flock more
sorts may be necessary, as the spinning
qualities of the wool will be more varied.
WINTER EGG PRODUCTION.
“Max”: “Jack Point” (B. 8/12/’27) is
off the target when he states that fowls cease
laying in winter because of the short work-
ing day. It is totally unnatural for them to
produce eggs in winter, and although man
has bred them to lay more eggs than they
ever wore intended to lay, adult hens are
mostly moulting or recovering from the moult
in the cold weather. Winter eggs are pro-
duced almost solely by forward pullets, and
if they are not forward enough to do so they
are not worth having. One of the main aims
of poultry-farming is to raise enough sturdy
early chickens to secure a good flock of
young winter layers. Well fed and comfort-
ably housed, these are the birds which bring
in large egg cheques, and if properly cared
for they don’t want any electric lights to
help them do it.
Amongst poultry-men there is too great a
tendency to quote America for every wonder-
ful idea, and they would be astonished if
they knew of the reverence which Yankee
chook-farmers have for the winter-laying
qualities of the fowls known to them as
Austral-Orps, our beautiful utility Black
Orpingtons. A well-grown flock of these
require no artificial daylight nor any other
tricks. They are steadier than Leghorns
in winter, and not so fussy about cold winds.
“Jack Point” entirely overlooks the cost
of current, which is generally twice or thrice
as high in Australia as in U.S.A., but our
winters are so short and sunny that the ques-
tion is not worth any consideration. The
winter in the northern parts of the U.S.A.
is so long and severe that it is almost irh-
possible for us to visualise it, and it is
ouite ridiculous to attempt to apply Ameri-
can methods in our own sun-blessed country.
LEMON LORE.
“Digger”: Lemons allowed to ripen
on the tree are coarse, deficient in juice,
will not keep long and are only fit for
factory use. In order to market lemons at
a satisfactory price they should be clipped
with as short a stem as possible. If fully
grown, it does not matter if the fruit is
quite green. On no account pick or pull
the fruit from the tree if it is to be stored.
Be careful not to scratch or bruise the skin.
Place in shallow boxes holding three to four
layers, and stack in a dry shed for 14 to
21 days, according to weather conditions.
Cases should bo stacked so that air can
circulate between them. Under this treatment
the lemons will lose surplus moisture, and
the skin will become tougher and thinner
and less likely to bruise. The next step
is to stack in a cellar or other cool, dry place
where fresh air circulates. Should the fruit
show any signs of shrivelling, damp the floor
with water at night. After three weeks’
sweating the lemons can be wrapped and
packed. After two months’ storage they will
be perfectly yellow in color, with much
thinner skins and full of juice.
HINTS FOR THE FARM.
“A. 8.”: Re the use of lime in the vege-
table garden. Parsnips, onions, beets, leeks,
celery, spinach, lettuces and cauliflowers
thrive in heavily-limed ground; moderate
quantities only should be given to carrots,
tomatoes, cucumbers, cabbage, pumpkins and
peas; while it should be added very lightly
to soils planted with corn, rhubarb, kohl
rabi, brussels sprouts and beans. The best
way to apply lime is to spread it over the
rough-broken soil and allow it to remain
there for at least seven days before being
dug in. Lime and stable refuse should not
be dug in at the same time, since the lime
releases gases and destroys the fertilising
strength of the manure.
“Dai R.” ; A lot of farmers, drovers and
other users of dogs don’t get the full value
out of them simply because they neglect to
wash them periodically with some mixture
that will rid them of fleas, or at any rate
help to keep fleas in check. Fleas sap
vitality, and although a flea-ridden dog will
work from innate faithfulness or fear of
his master, he can’t put the vim into his
job that a flea-free animal can. There are
several good washes. Lysol and slieep-dip
in water are two of the best I know. When
possible, a dog should be washed once a
week.
“Viret” : The following formula will give
you the number of trees or plants required
to plant an acre at various distances apart.
Square the distance apart in feet and divide
this number into the number of square feet
in an acre—43,s6o. Thus, if distance apart
is 11 feet the square of this. 121 feet,
divided into 43,560 gives 360 plants to the
acre.
“Silentio”: A crop that gives a liberal
return for ordinary treatment is the lima-
bean. Both tall and dwarf varieties are
available, and the beans are shelled like
broad-beans. As a commercial proposition
these beans pay well, as dried lima-beans
always command good money on the local
market. The dwarf variety is best for
handling this way, allowing the pods to ripen
on the bush. They should then be shelled
and the drying completed in a shed, when
thev are ready for sale. The beans keep
well, and can be stored till market condi-
tions are favorable.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
PETER FREW watched Dinnie Ryan
melt into the gloom of thick gidya, and
then returned to his camp. The place
ivas lonely. .
About once in two months Dinnie Ryan
visited Peter Frew’s camp; and once in
twelve months Peter Frew drove a string ot
pack-horses to the head station, which lay a
hundred and seven miles east. For nine years
he had done this, and had kept the western
end of the great run under observatmn. 1 er-
haps twice in a year he caught a glimpse ot
a stock-camp, but he preferred to give the
stockmen little thought. On one memorable
occasion he had had an assistant granted him
temporarily. Somehow they had not agreed;
and Peter Frew’s sluggish brain had never
tried to probe the cause.
He entered the old bough shed and stopped.
On the boxwood table a magazine lay. Its
cover glistened in the daylight, and that fact
held Peter Frew’s attention. He had seen
scores of magazines which had failed to
attract him. This one was different. It
seemed to glow. The cover design was not
a picture, yet it attracted. Usually Dinnie
Ryan left magazines which were tilled with
cold print; and Peter Frew’s knowledge of
English was not sufficient to allow him to
read. Sometimes, though he seldom had
chance to do it, he managed to decipher the
meaning of a picture by half guessing the
words beneath it.
He picked up the magazine, opened it and
tossed over the pages of advertisements. His
dull senses received a shock. A bewitching
girl smiled at him from a full-page portrait.
She was scantily clad in filmy draperies, and
represented the soul of mischief. He felt
a sudden eagerness, and groping about found
a seat, keeping his eyes on the picture mean-
while. Slowly he turned the next smooth
page, as though reluctant to part with the
first. There his attention was caught by four
photographs; and the two which held him
most were crowded beach scenes. He gathered
that the photos were of a popular rendezvous
at the other side of the world.
For hours Peter Frew turned the pages
over and over; and every time he reached the
last page he stopped and thought awhile, and
then went through them again. His mind
whirled through a maze of childlike astonish-
ment.
What had he been missing these many
years? Questions and answers tumbled
through his mind. During his forty years
of life he had never seen the sea —never seen
any of those glorious stretches of beach on
which so many thousands of people displayed
themselves. lie studied the facial expressions
of the many girls in the photographs, sensed
the deep appeal which tugged at him, then
turned back to the front-page girl. He could
not read her name; but she was smiling for
him, and for him alone. He started suddenly
and glanced about.
Throughout the rest of the afternoon Peter
Frew remained beneath a spell. He glanced
many times towards the hills in the cast, and
slowly a definite resolution grew in his mind.
He would draw all his money, which had
accumulated on the station books through
the years, and he would go and see these
places and people for himself. Perhaps he
would see the wonderful g.rl—talk to her—
receive a smile. He would visit those places
where people tumbled about in snow; he
would go to the great theatres in London and
in Paris. Yes, he had been buried for years
—nearly ten years—-without seeing a white
woman’s face.
Peter Frew found a sudden interest m
life. His actions grew brisk, and he became
breathless with his discovery. He devoured
his supper, and then packed his few belong-
ings.
Sunrise saw him well along the road to
the homestead. His horses _ jogged in a line
ahead; and every little while he pulled the
shiny magazine from his shirt and glanced
again at the portrait of the girl—his danc-
ing-girl—and then at the pictures following.
Throughout the day, and throughout the
next day Peter Frew absorbed the con-
tents of the magazine as he rode, until he
could visualise every face without effort. He
had fallen in love with the dancing girl; he
had succumbed to the spell of the great
beaches; the breathless picture of a ballet
of fourteen shapely girls remained limned
vividly in his mind. He had never known
before just what he was missing; and he
began to marvel at his ignorance.
The sight of the white roofs of the home-
stead buildings gave him an abrupt shock.
His thoughts dropped from a laud of enchant-
ment to stark plains, heat and mirages.
“I advise you not to take all this money
with you,” the station-manager said an hour
later. “You’ve eleven hundred and three
pounds to your credit. Draw a hundred, and
I’ll arrange to pay you the rest in Sydney.”
Peter Frew recognised a wealth of sense
in the manager’s advice. He suddenly realised
that when he reached the first township old
acquaintances would claim him..
“All right,” he said ; “give me a hundred —
but you’re sure I’ll be able to get the rest
when I want it?” He glanced down at the
addressed envelope in his hands.
“You will,” the manager replied. “When
you get to a decent town, have a shave, a
haircut and a general clean-up ; buy yourself
a tailor-made rigout, and you’ll do. The
world’s a funny place. You have to dress.
But you’ll come back after you’ve found that
little dancer and frolicked about on those
beaches —yes, you’ll come back!”
“Eh?” Peter said, and scratched his
tousled head in confusion. Somehow the
future seemed to suddenly hold obstacles
and risks.
In at the small township old acquaintances
recognised him and claimed him. They had
heard the news. He must say good-bye in
proper fashion. What! Surely he wasn’t
going to play the high hand just because
he was going on a long tour !
Thus Peter Frew found himself breasting
the hotel bar. He felt a quaint mixture of
satisfaction and fear. The place was still
much the same. He remembered the maga-
zine in his shirt, and compared the dancing
girl to the powdered, blowsy girl wheezing
before him.
The man beside him was the local mail
contractor, who also carried passengers to
and from the rail-head for £8 each way.
Vaguely Peter Frew heard himself book a
seat in the mail-car, and swallowed a power-
ful rum. The glass before him was filled
again. Everyone asked questions. The din
was irritating. Somebody started a fight, and
Peter Frew felt an annoyance. What was
FAST WORK.
“Do you believe in love at first sight, Bertha?”
“Rather! It can happen in the twinkling of an eye.”
all the infernal row about? He didn’t want
a row. He just wanted to bid good-bye
quietly, and get on with his journey.
The cattle —out at tlie western end of
the run —who would be looking after them
now? Why, there wasn’t another man who
could do it. The mail-car would not be
leaving for three days. Peter Frew felt a
vague fear.
At closing time two bearded men tugged
Peter Frew from the bar and left him in a
waggon-rut.
Before dawn he roused himself to a world
of throbbing agony, and staggered about the
hotel verandah. He swore and babbled.
Where were his horses? What cursed
mongrel had stolen them? If he did not get
to his work the cattle would wander into the
waterless country! Somebody gave him a
small whisky, and for a time he felt better.
At sunrise he was breasting the bar
again, with men on either side, still saying
good-bye, still breaking off half-way through.
Why couldn’t they leave him alone? He
wanted to find that dancing girl. He didn't
want this row. He grew loud in protest,
and was drawn into hot argument. Some-
body pulled him about and he hit back.
Men were everywhere. He hit wildly, and
felt vague thumps in return. Then the day-
light went suddenly.
Early on the third day the mail contrac-
tor tossed Peter Frew in amongst a load
of mail-bags and drove off.
“You’ll get no fare from him !” somebody
called. “He came here with a hundred, and
it’s all boozed !” But the mail contractor
was not concerned.
When the rail-head was reached Peter
Frew was beginning to discover his where-
abouts, though the discovery was coupled
with an agonising thirst.
In the main street a number of children
played rounders. A cornet blew mournfully;
a railway engine whistled harshly. Peter
Frew cursed at the sound; and walked
unsteadily into the nearest hotel. Argument
held sway inside. The place was noisy. He
gulped a drink and watched the mail con-
tractor do the same; then without a word
he bumped out into the twilight.
Outside a man was accelerating a motor-
car. The roar grated on Peter Frew’s nerves.
Why did people make such an infernal row?
Me headed for the roar of the hotel, only to
eome on three children shouting at a liumor-
ous Chinese cook. He swore at the noise
and continued on.
His aching head revolted against the clat-
ter of conversation, the sound of laughter,
the shrill cry of engines, the rising and
falling groan and whir of passing motor-
cars. He wanted to get away from it all.
He tugged the magazine from his shirt and
glanced at the portrait of the dancer. She
wouldn’t want a row made. She would like
to move in a quiet way.
He looked at the picture closely, and
somehow there was a new look on the face.
It was an expression of grinning sarcasm.
Peter Frew reached the footpath, and was
aware of a throttling sound. A large car
loomed up, the lights shot out and lit up the
roadway vividly. A man spoke.
“Long time since I seen you. Peter. How’s
things?”
The voice was welcome to Peter Frew. He
was conscious that the car was running very
quietly. Andy Black had run cars for
hire for many years, and this was a nice car,
too. It ran softly.
“Can I send a telegram?” Peter croaked.
“Office is closed,” Andy Black answered
shortly. “Open in the mornin’.”
“Write one down for me,” Peter said.
“One of the girls in the bar’ll send it.”
They went back, borrowed pen and ink.
“What is it?” Andy Black asked with pen
raised.
“Er—-just put—‘Manager, Wahringa .Sta-
tion —coming back—Peter Frew’ —and this
girl’ll send it.” He tossed a banknote across
the counter. “Now then, Andy, run me
straight out!”
They turned towards the street door again.
Suddenly Peter Frew stopped. He tugged
the shiny worn magazine from his shirt, and
flung it against the wall.
ARTHUR GROOM.
Beige.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
BEIGE,” she had said; “beige—a kind
of fawn.”
The church clock chimed the
quarter, and the youth standing beneath,
just where the trams stop, started and
pulled out his watch. Quarter-past six.
She had said six o’clock. He strained his
eyes eastward and perceived another Manly
tram looming over the rise. Surely she
would be in this one?
The tram drew up opposite him and three
passengers alighted—an elderly couple and
a schoolboy. Be peered anxiously at the
passengers still seated inside, but the tram
started without another soul showing any
inclination to get off.
The youth’s heart resumed a normal beat
and he withdrew with a sigh to his former
reclining-place against the church wall to
gaze once more in the direction of on-
coming Manly trams and think of beige—a
kind of fawn.
And a voice. He wondered if he would
recognise her when she did arrive. lie had
never seen her, yet he thought it would not
be difficult. He pictured a small, neat
figure ; a little head Held proudly high, slim
ankles and feet. not ridiculously small —
falling in quick succession in a self-confident
walk suggesting almost a swagger, but for-
givable and rendered charming in its very
innocence of conscious effort; features small
and decided that told of breeding, and ex-
pression that seemed to indicate humorous
inquiry mixed with amused disdain; coat,
hat, shoes and stockings of beige (a kind of
fawn),.
Yes, that was her, he was sure.
He had known her for months through
the telephone and letters, but to-day he was
to see her. Her voice rang in his cars —a
voice low and cultured and remarkable for
its charm even to the vulgar ears of the
world, but to him, intoxicating. He wondered
what he would say to her when she came.
And what she would say to him.
Still another tram deposited a motley
crowd upon the pavement. He swiftly sorted
them over, but turned away once more and
began to pace up and down.
Nearly half-past six. What made her so
late? Girls, he reflected, were notorious for
being late for appointments, on principle
apparently. Surely the next one would be
hers!
Another tram came in view. He stood
upon the edge of the pavement and watched
its approach, confident that this time. ...
A girl was on the footboard ready to jump
off. A taxi honked warningly, intent upon
drawing up level with the pavement by the
tram-stop. The girl glanced .round in the act
of stepping off, saw the taxi, but too late
to arrest her action. She made a dive for
the kerb. The youth’s blood rushed from
his face as he'realised, even as the taxi
struck, that she was wearing—-a kind of
fawn!....
The doctor rose and wiped his hands upon
a large handkerchief.
“Instantaneous,” he pronounced briskly.
The crowd pressed round, pushing and
elbowing, mad with the morbid lust to look
upon a dead body. The youth was on his
knees in his shirtsleeves; a lifeless little head
was resting upon his folded coat. At the
doctor’s ultimatum he felt for perhaps three
seconds utterly numbed —crushed and for-
gotten by God. And then abruptly he
seemed to break down. Tears came to his
eyes, and he turned a helpless expression
upon a woman standing near.
“Tell me,” he whispered, “what color
would you call that girl’s coat?”
He knelt down by the girl, and Ins heart
swelled afresh as the shrill sound of the
belated ambulance bell broke upon the
hushed group. He felt a hand upon his
shoulder. A soft voice speaking,
sounding strangely familiar: “No, it isn.t
beige. Look, 'this is beige—this coat, this
hat that I’m wearing”

(1) What was the numerical strength of
the aborigines in Australia at the advent of
white settlement? (2) How many are there
to-day? (3) When did the last of the Tas-
manian blacks die? (4) Is the decline of the
aborigines rapid? —2762.
(1) Estimated by various observers at
150,000, but this figure must be regarded as
a very rough approximation. (2) The 1926
census gave 59,296 full-bloods and 15,102
half-castes. Full-bloods included 10,000
estimated as living outside the influence of
whites in (3) 1876. (4) Yes,
figures for N.S.W. and Yic. show that in
1891 there were six times as many full-
blooded aborigines as there are to-day.
A character in one of Joseph Conrad's
books is a Sydney shopkeeper. Who was

in December, 1878. and he appears in “Be-
cause of the Dollars.”

How can I distinguish edible mushrooms
from toadstools and other poisonous fungi? —
Sprinkle a little salt on the spongy parts,
or gills. If they turn yellow they are poison-
ous; if black, they are wholesome. Allow
sufficient time for salt to act. Gills of true
mushrooms are pinky-red, changing to liver
color. The flesh is white, the stem white,
solid and cylindrical. False mushrooms have
an astringent and disagreeable taste. When
cut they turn blue. They are moist on
the surface, and generally of a rose or an
orange color. “False” mushrooms generally
emerge from a vulva, or bag, and usually
grow in tufts or clusters.

What is a remedy for falling hair? Is
there a cure for baldness? —2581.
There is no cure for baldness and no
reliable remedy for falling hair if the con-
dition is due to advancing years. There is,
however, a disease known as alopecia areata
in which patches of hair fall out. This
trouble rights itself in time, but the follow-
ing is helpful:—Aceti cantharidis, one
drachm; adipis lanae, one drachm; ung.
hydrarg. oxid. rubr., one ounce.
I have reached intermediate standard and
want to become a solicitor. (1) What is the
procedure in N.S.W.? (2) How long would
I have to study, and what would be the cost?
—2665.
The Rules of Court require five years
articled clerkship, or in the case of a Uni-
versity graduate, three years. Before being
articled you must pass a law matriculation,
which may be included in the Leaving Cer-
tificate. Articled clerks are required to pass
a legal history exam., an intermediate law
exam, and a final which may be taken in
sections. University graduates with the
degree of Bachelor of Laws are exempt from
the greater portion of these tests. (2)
Assuming you passed all examinations at
first attempt, time five years. (3) Cost in
fees at least £55.
(1) Is the importation of cocaine into
Australia restricted? (2) Is it heavily
taxed? —2633.
Importation of cocaine and other narcotic
drugs is restricted to persons who have
been licensed by the Commonwealth Govern-
ment. These licenses are issued only to estab-
lished wholesale drug merchants. Further
licenses (called “permits to import”) must
be secured for each individual shipment and
sent to the country of origin, whose Govern-
ment then licenses the exporter to send the
shipment to Australia, this being by inter-
national agreement. Every grain of cocaine
which enters Australia by legitimate
channels is recorded and kept track of. In
N.S.W., under the Police Offences (Danger-
ous Drugs) Amendment Act, it is an offence,
punishable with a fine of £lOO, for any
unauthorised person to have a narcotic drug
in his possession. The duty (Federal
Narcotic Tax) on cocaine is very small.
What vessels for the Royal Australian
Navy are building? Where are they being
built? What are their respective displace-
ments and power? —27sB.
Two cruisers, the Australia and the Can-
berra, each 10,000 tons displacement and
80,000 h.p., are being built in Scotland.
Two submarines, the Oxl-ey and the Otway,
are being built in England, and a seaplane-
carrier, the Albatross (6000 tons and 12,000
h.p.) is being built at Cockatoo Dockyard,
Sydney, by the Commonwealth Shipping
Board.
(1) Is there any record of fish or frogs
having fallen with rain? (2) Was there
such a fall at Perth ( W.A. ) ? —2387.
Showers of fish have occurred. Scientists
attribute the phenomenon to the action of air
currents drawing up sea-water and small
fish, which later fall with rain. The immedi-
ate appearance of frogs, which have hiber-
nated in dried mud for long periods, after
heavy showers is doubtless the origin of the
belief that they come with the rain. (2) A
shower of fish was observed in the Upper
Swan valley on the morning of July 2,
1927. Full particulars were given in the
AVest Australian of July 20.
Gan an Australian soldier in receipt of
a small war-pension get paid a lump sum in
full settlement? —2569.
Yes. Section 32 of the Repatriation Act
(1920-22) sets out that where the pension
is not more than 30 per cent, of the total
incapacity rate the Commission may assess
the lump sum which, with the consent of the
member, shall be substituted for the liability
to payment of a pension under the Act.
Forward a written application to Deputy-
Commissioner, Repat. Commission, Sydney,
stating the purpose to which you intend to
devote the lump sum and enclose references
regarding character. The pensions of your
wife and children may not be commuted.
I am sole beneficiary under the will of my
father who died in 1924. I have several
times requested the executors to furnish me
with a statement of account, but without
even a. reply. What should I do? —2417.
A statement of accounts is usually fur-
nished by executors to the Registrar of Pro-
bate within 12 months of the grant of pro-
bate. Ascertain if this has been done. The
Registrar may advise you in the matter.
Otherwise place it in the hands of a solicitor,
after notice to the executors of your inten-
tion to do so.
(1) Did W. M. Hughes when Prime Minis-
ter of Australia stop the engineers while on
strike from operating on their private bank-
ing accounts? (2) What is the rule regard-
ing the shuffling of discards in six-handed
poker? —26B4.
(1) Y.ss, during the Marine Engineer
strike, January, 1920. (2) Varies. The
general rule is to shuffle the discards (plus
the last card, which cannot be dealt in a
“buy”) only if necessary to complete the
“buy.”

SPORTING
NOTIONS
Under the Whip
When betting- opened on the Flying
Handicap at Rosehill on Saturday 20 to 1
was called in a couple of places about The
Bulletin’s choice, Don Moon. Other book-
makers began at twelves and tens. They
were all sought out by owner Otway
Falkiner and followers of Booth’s stable,
and the Doncaster Handicap winner came
down to 6 to 1. Persuasion was favorite
at 7 to 2, Somnolent (7 to 1) and Cave
Dweller (8 to 1) being the only others
substantially backed, though there were 22
runners.
Persuasion and Don Moon had bad posi-
tions at the barrier, but they were out by
themselves a furlong from home, with the
rest hopelessly beaten. When Bartle’s whip
was shaken at him, Don Moon rushed past
the mare, whom he beat easily by a couple
of lengths; Beauhania (10 to 1), finishing
well, cut Somnolent out of third place, and
Irish Prince was prominent among the also-
rans. Don Moon, who carried his Villiers
weight—it is only 81b. more than he won
the Doncaster with —got over the seven
furlongs in lmin. 251 sec. It was a most
convincing trial for the mile race at Rand-
wick on Saturday.
The Parramatta Mile was also expected
to throw light on the Villiers. Dick Woot-
ton’s imported mare Zuleika was favorite
at 3 to 1, but she was twice interfered with,
on the second occasion losing several lengths;
in the circumstances she did well to run
fourth. After Rozener (8 to 1) had led for
most of the journey, Vallino (7 to 2), who
had Jimmy Pike’s services, came through
and defeated the Rossendale gelding b;<|
three lengths, Bonliomms (33 to 1) being-
third ; lmin. 40|sec. was the time. It was
the first glimpse of form Vallino had shown
since her two-year-old days, when she was
highly thought of.
Vitality, favorite for the Summer Cup,
had an easy task in the Granville Stakes,
for which he was favorite at 6 to 4, and
performed it to the satisfaction of the stable.
With the exception of Firefly (5 to 1), his
opponents were third- and fourth raters, and
Firefly galloped very unimpressively after a
bad getaway. Trahere (10 to 1) was travel-
ling faster at the finish than Vitality, but
McCarten may have been “kidding.' On
the other hand, Bacchus, who had disputed
Summer Cup favoritism with Vitality, could
do no better than fifth in the December
Handicap, though a 2-to-l favorite. Spaghetti
(7 to 1), nicely handled by little Lillyman,
was always in front, and Drake (7 to 1)
and Linatic (11 to 2), who chased him
home, were making no impression on him
at the finish; but Spaghetti is hardly the
cut of a Summer Cup horse. A mile and
a quarter is probably his best distance; he
ran it on Saturday in 2min. 6sec.
Crowdel gave a fillup to Crowdennis’s
stud reputation by running away with a
division of the Nursery Handicap, for which
he went out at 5 to 1. This colt is very
smart. Starpoi, a gelded son of Poitrel-
Early Star, surprised nearly everybody in
the Maiden Three-year-old Handicap, in
which he came with a Poitrel-like run at
the right moment. His name was not
written by most of the bookmakers —one is
alleged to have laid £IOO to £1 —and his few
backers on the grandstand tote received £2B
2s. apiece in addition to the 10s. staked. On
a gtraiglitout machine, even with the extor-
tionate 121 p.c. deduction, the odds would
have been about 113£ to 1.
* * * *
The A..T.C. hoped that Rampion would
be a runner in the Villiers Stakes next Satur-
day. but the Briens withdrew their horse
after lie had become a popular pick, in
doubles, at least. They were within their
rights in doing so, of course, but some of
these owners show a very trifling amount of
consideration for the people who keep the
game going. Fuji San lias also been
scratched, but good and fair-to-middling
horses engaged are Persuasion (Bst. 71b.),
Don Moon, Bravado and Quan Tart (Bst.

Gib), Beauhania and Greenhorn (Bst. 51b),
Honan and Beckwith (Bst. 21b), Mullabawn
(Sst.), Ascalon and Royal Sun (7st.
91b.), Zuleika (7st. 31b.), and Rozener
(Gst. 131 b). These (or some of them)
should furnish an interesting race. On Rose-
hill form, it is difficult to go beyond Don
Moon, especially as Horoscope, whom he
beat in the Doncaster, has been doing un-
commonly well in Melbourne recently; but
the Villiers is never a cakewalk for the
favoi’ite.
The Summer Cup, to be run on Monday,
looks open. Bacchus (Bst. 121 b.) has been
rather a disappointment since he ran that
meritorious second to Pantheon in the Rose-
hill Cup, but he is never to be despised.
Vitality (Bst. 61b.) has a third in the 1926
Metropolitan to his credit, and is in a very
successful stable, while Resource and Night
Heron (7st. 101 b.), Prime Don (7st. 71b.),
Blaircourt (7st. 41b.). Don Panther (7st.
31b.), Spaghetti (7st. 21b. 1. Solomon (7st.).
Firefly (6st. 101 b.) and Wcolita (Gst. 91b.)
have friends. This Page’s preference is for
Night Heron. A horse of the one-pace tpye, he
doesn’t finish as brilliantly as some of the
younger ones, but he can go a long way at
his one pace, and he has done a solid pre-
paration. Fancies for the two days:—
Villiers Stakes : Don Moon, 1; Zuleika, 2 ;
Quan Tart, 3.
December Nursery: Golden Music.
Trial Handicap: Violian.
Holiday Handicap: Wedding Eve; next,
Night Heron.
Highweight Handicap : Market Day ; next,
Bacagi.
Summer Cup: Night Heron, 1; Resource,
2 ; Blaircourt, 3.

Results were decidedly against Vic.
punters at Mentone on Saturday. They
started off on the wrong leg when Duncan’s
mount, St. Teresa (10 to 1), beat a large
field in the youngsters’ race, and the Mentone
Handicap was fairly disastrous to them.
Textile, who had been touched off by Horo-
scope in a similar event the previous Satur-
day, was a G-to-4 favorite, with Stralia next
in order at 7 to 2 and Phocion at fives. But
Bard of Avon (20 to 1), after making most
of the pace, got the verdict by a head from
Brigadier Bob (12 to 1), Textile being third.
It was Bard of Avon’s first success since
he landed the Williamstown Cup last year.
Fox- a winner of that race and of the A.J.C.
Metropolitan he was wonderfully well in at
Bst. 21b. in sxich a field, but he had run so
many bad races that nearly everybody had
grown tired of backing him. What a friend
he has been to the bookmakers throughout
his career!
On Killara’s running in Melbourne —he
was very unlucky on the last day of the
Melbourne Cup meeting—he should have an
excellent chance in the Port Adelaide Cup
with Bst. 31b. Scobie hopes to succeed with
Gleamlight, but Killara’s claims look a trifle
superior on paper.

“Ula”: Despite the gloomy remarks of
“Two Seas” (B. 15/12/’27), cross-country
jockeys adopt the Sloan crouch and contrive
to escape serious accident. Webster, Butler,
Inkson, Sheldon and Leonard are among the
Victorians who ride short; Webster’s knees
almost touch his chin —a veritable Tod
Sloan. True, fences are not what they used
to be, but horses still rap ’em.
“Jack Point": Queenslanders are awaiting
with intei’est the meeting of High Syce with
something that can make him gallop up to
a mile and a half. His last 10 starts have
yielded nine wins (Sires Produce Stakes,
Derby and Guineas among them) and a
third in the Queensland Oup, which was
evidently too far for him. In the Windsor
Handicap, 12 furlongs, he carried Sst. 91b.
and donkey-licked some of the best Qxxeens-
land handicap horses. The son of Highfield
—Concise now ranks as Queensland’s high-
est stake-winning tliree-year-old, having
earned £5860 for his joint owners, pastoral-
ist John McCoi-mack and veteran trainer
Bill Noud. And all for a modest 210 guineas
as a yearling.
* * * *
“Ibn el Issar” : Reference to the Aga Khan
(B. l/12/’27) l’ecalls the fact that annually,
on his birthday, he is presented by the
Ismaili Moslems, of whom he is the head,
with his weight in gold. If his luck in
buying yearlings does not improve, he will
need to put on weight considerably. Twice
in one week last year he paid over 10,000
guineas for a yearling filly at the Newmarket
sales. He gave 10,500 guineas for one that
won her first race, worth £lO7, at the fifteenth
attempt—her name, Gay Baby, is appro-
priate. The other lass, known as Fete, cost
12,000 guineas; she ran a second at her third
start. Both are by The Tetrarch, for whose
mostly grey-tinted progeny the Aga Khan
seems to have a partiality— indeed most
Moslems are as keen as Will Ogilvie on grey
horses.
* * * *
“Amateur Urger”: The second race for
the King’s Cup—Flemington saw the first —
is to be held at Randwick on Satui’day,
April 14, the last day of the autumn meet-
ing. Added money is to be £2OOO ; the dis-
tance i§ a mile and a halt. Handicaps
range from 9st. 51b. to 7st., weights being
declared on April 2, the Monday after the
Warwick Farm meeting. Entries close on
January 17. It is probable that the A.J.C.
Plate will be temporarily dropped from the
programme to make room for the King’s
gift event. Perhaps George V.’s trophy is
what the Vallino people are after.
* * * -Jr-
“Sylvia Park”: The old rule that it is
never well to judge a sausage by its over-
coat is confirmed by the statement of a
Maoriland authority that Musket was
brought to the Shivery Isles “chiefly with a
view to his use as a sire of carnage horses.”
Taken to the wilds of Waitako for that pur-
pose, he was fortunately rescued. In his
six years of life from his arrival from Eng-
land at Auckland in 1879 Musket sired Car-
bine and Trenton, among others, and his
descendants won £135,000 in England, Maori-
land and Australia during a period when
prize-money was nothing like as lavish as it
is to-day.
M.Q. (and Rafferty) Rules
A big crowd enjoyed a very willing fight
at the Leichhardt Stadium on Friday night,
when Goi'don Kiely (list. 3Jlb.) got a deci-
sion over Merv Williams (list. at
the end of 15 rounds. Williams made the
pace and cracked Kiely hard and often with
both fists. But the Victorian possesses a
left hand the like of which has not been
seen in Sydney for many a long day, and
Williams, clever as he is, seemed unable to
stop it with anything but his dial, which
was badly kixocked about. He kept pegging
away, however, with his dangerous rights
and twice put Kiely on the canvas. When
the Victorian was dropped for “seven” in
the 14th, most of the spectatoi-s thought it
was the end and Merv was wildly cheered,
especially by the lai*ge contingent from Bal-
main. But Kiely was grimly determined, and
his stabbing left won him the 15th by a
good margin. “Yank” Pearl would have
earned populai-ity had he said “a draw”;
but his vei-dict was right.
* * * $
Bobby Gray, the Sydney bantam, -won
battle after battle and gave promise of
greatness until he was bi'utally assaulted at
Newcastle. As he walked to the local stadium
to fight a coalfield boy, liis xnouth was badly
smashed by either a stone or a knuckle-
duster, and in every succeeding mill it was
cut by the first punch that landed on it.
Bobby seemed to lose heart and faded out.
His return to the ring has not been a success.
He was outpointed in a 15-rounder at the
Sydney Stadium on Saturday night by
“Taffy” Jones. The winner scaled Bst. 81b.,
two pounds more than Gray.
* * * *
“Hayband” : Though “Griffo” sold papers
he couldn’t read them. Still, he knew what
his world-famous nickname looked like in
print. About the time he arrived in San
Francisco a Fairy Grotto was being advei*-
tised all over the city. The T’s were long
and the word appeared familiar. “They soon
got on to me,” remarked the “fedder” com-
placently.

BALLADE OF THE BUTCHERED
BOOK.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Night betting becomes illegal in N. S. Wales
from January 1.”
His brow was furrowed and his eyes were sad
As from a pint he puffed the frothing head.
I sought to hearten him. “Cheer up, my
lad,
This is the blessfed Christmastide,” I said.
“Life at its best is short, and we’ll be dead
A devil of a time. What is it bites?”
“Enough,” he growled, “to make a bloke
a lied ;
I gutter cease to lay the field o’ nights.”
I sympathised. “You'd think,” I said, “they
had
Some more important legislative bread
To bake than this? Still, things are not so
bad
Since Lang and Co. were from the tart-
sliop sped.
Kay, sunshine harvester, is harvested
And civic wrongs will soon be put to rights.”
He groaned as one whose heart is heavy
as lead:
“But I must wear me bag no more o’ nights.”
“We made the hearts of pony owners glad
Who once would lay the cyclist and the
ped.
Where, without us, had been the trotting
prad
And the synthetic hare?” he hazarded.
“Next thing, to show that mirth and joy
have fled,
They'll ring the curfew bell and dowse the
lights.
The punter, Mister, were as well in bed
As sans a book to lay him bets o’ nights.”
Envoy.
“Happy New Year!” I couldn’t help but
add.
“Happy!” he snapped. “Me hopes it
blasts and blights.
Butchered to gratify a wowser’s fad,
I needs must cease to yell the odds o’
nights.”

‘‘Bisque”: All going well, tlie Frenchmen
will make their landfall in Maonland on
January 15. They are booked to play at
Wellington on the 16tli and 1 < th, and a
Auckland on the 18th, leaving tor bydne.
on the following day. The travellers are
certainly expected to earn their oats wnue
in the Dominion.
* * * *
“J.P.” : Warned by the literal washout of
the first Davis Cup trial matches m Syd-
ney, the various State bodies concerned with
the visit of the French players have com-
bined to insure the games. Both Melbourne
and Sydney are spending a lot of brass on
extra stand accommodation, the Sydney com-
mitment being £I2OU for a stand holding
2000 people, in addition to those already
provided for. Melbourne is more economi-
cal, being content with seating the sloping
bank at Kooyong at a cost of £500; this is
expected to cater for an extra 1800.
* ❖ * *
“Spin” : Though strenuously denied at the
time, the report that J. O. Anderson was
applying to the lawn tennis heads for re-
instatement as an amateur (B. 24/11/27)
proved to be correct. The N.S.W. authori-
ties considered his application last week,
and passed it on to the Australian body.
Daily-paper writers assert that the man
hasn’t a hope, and make much of the alleged
point that his rcadmission would encourage
other amateurs to turn pros, for a season
and then demand to be taken into the lily-
white fold again. Considering that most of
the Australian tennis amateurs of note are
already treading on the heels of profession-
alism as defined by the authorities m Eng-
land and America, it seems hardly worth
while to take up this superior attitude.
There is neither logic nor decency, indeed,
in straining at Anderson’s readmission and
winking at the standing of most of his
amateur contemporaries.
* * * *
“Cash Amateur”: The English L.T.A.
has dropped the axe on the “writ '.‘-player
(B. 15/12/’27), and the implement is to be
used in other cases of dubious amateurism.
Genuine player-journalists who get a permit
mav deal with tennis in their own journals,
but any player taking money for broadcast-
ing tennis, or for allowing articles to appear
under his name, initials or recognisable
pseudonym, or for permitting his name to
be mentioned in interviews, will be placed
under the ban. So will the individual who
allows his name to be advertised commerci-
ally for any match, or teaches tennis by
correspondence, or lectures on the game for
cash. It is a fairly comprehensive dragnet,
and if used in Australian waters would net
nearly every prominent player of either sex
in this country. Yet there may be ways
out. A Scots delegate characteristically in-
quired what would happen if an editor asked
a leading light to report the Davis Cup
gratis and later presented him with a hand-
some cheque as an advance payment for his
impressions of Timbuctoo.
* * * *
“Trousseau” : There is considerable heart-
burning in exalted lawn tennis circles in
N.S.W. over the decision to allow male mem-
bers of the Davis Cup team £4O for clothing
and racquet stringing, but only £2O to the
Sydney girls who are going with the team
to visit South Africa and Europe. These
are days of Liberty, Equality and all the
rest of it, and it is felt that the injurious
differentiation calls for protest. As one. ex-
perienced lady has pointed out, fashions
change so. When the last women’s team
reached England it found, to its horror, that
the skirts brought from Sydney were already
demode, and they had to be drastically
shortened. That' sort of thing cannot be
allowed to happen again, for the sake ,of
Australia’s fair fame, and the association

bags. Failing that, the writer suggests an
application to Good Old Piddo for a varia-
tion of the award.
The Nineteenth Hole
“The McHaggis” : When the golfers in the
final of the Australian foursomes messed up
the game by playing, each couple, with the
other fellows’ ball, the A.G.U. declared the
championship a washout. The Royal and
Ancient at St. Andrew’s, reporting on the
incident, as requested, says that the players
should have been disqualified for that round
only and allowed another flutter at the
championship, having defeated the rest of
the field. In effect, though the Royal and
Ancient doesn’t say so, the A.G.U. would do
well to read up the rules. The match is not
likely to be replayed now. Legh Winser,
one of the four —the others are Victorians—
is a South Australian, and may not be able
to come over to Melbourne.
* * * *
“Spoon”: If Jack Gregory is losing some
of his powers as a howler, he is finding con-
solation in golf, at which he is showing
signs of excelling. Already a long and fairly
accurate hitter, he has lately been turning
his attention to the short game, and seems
to be well on his way to master that part
of the science. He has had plenty of pre-
decessors who turned from cricket to golf
with results satisfying to them, at least.
Though he began at an age when a lot of
people think of leaving it off, W. G. Grace
developed into a plus man, while A. E. Stod-
dart and the Palairet brothers, to name only
a few, were also in the first class of their
day on the fairway and the green.
* * * *
“Silver Spot”: Tom Coleman (B.
17/11/’27) has put up more than one record
at the Swan Island (Vic.) links. Playing
with a military opponent one day, Tom
visited the rough often and addressed ill-
chosen remarks to the inoffensive scenery.
Interrupting one of these outbreaks, the
Major came upon a snake which had obvi-
ously been slugged out with a niblick.
Thomas passed on with a casual glance ; his
opponent stood watching the reptile’s
frantic wriggles. Presently, hearing a yell,
Coleman looked round. “He hasn't bitten
you, has he, Major?” he asked. “No,” the
Major replied, “but when he hoard what you
said last he bit himself.” Tom’s command
of language may be connected witli the fact
that he played 22 seconds in golf before he
scored his first win. He was the first man
to cycle from Darwin to Melbourne. “Hop”
made that achievement the subject of a
Bulletin cartoon.
* * * *
“X”: Playing in a mixed foursome on
the Lismore (N.S.W.) links, nine holes, Dr.
Banks and Mrs. P.arlex went round in 33
off the stick, and left Colpnel Bogey amongst
the also-ran. I wonder if there are any
other links where the record has been broken
in a mixed foursome.
* * * *
“E.K.”: There is no game to approach
golf in the matter of self-convinced cham-
pions. These often fail to convince anyone
else but themselves when it comes to the
crude test of actual competition. Such a
one is a well-known Melbourne sliort-handi-
cap man, whose particular obsession is giving
good advice to beginners anxious, or other-
THE LANDLORD OF THE SHEARERS’ ARMS GIVES THE BOYS A WHOLE
BARREL FOR CHRISTMAS.
wise, to improve their game. The advice
usually takes the form of urging these to
play with him rather than with others of
their own golfing calibre. Adjurations to
observe methods of playing a mashie shot,
for instance, are followed by demonstrations
of how the result, or what it should have
been, has been arrived at. Meanwhile, his
unwilling pupils are lost in imagining the
far-away green hills of the nineteenth.
There is only one method of dealing with a
man who is convinced that he knows all
the nine and forty w-ays of constructing
golf strokes. That is to find him a job as a
golf-writer.
* * * *
“Maroon”: The brains and beauty of
Canberra opened the new extension of the
18-hole golf course the other day with a
mixed foursome. There was some hitch over
publishing the results, a caveat having been
entered against certain players whose resi-
dential qualifications were in doubt, though
whether these are M’s.II.R. is not certain.
However, after Stanley Bruce had driven the
first ball, described by the member of the
Hansard staff who was on duty as “a clink-
ing 200 yards,” the game proceeded to its
finish, in spite of a heavy storm. The lead-
ing net scores were two 79’s by Dawkins and
Mrs. Brackenreg, and Brackenreg and Mrs.
Lapish, each pair being handicapped minus
20. Stanley and Mrs. Bruce, with a minus
12 handicap, finished fourth, doing 95 off
the stick. As the best score of that sort
was 94, by C. Smith and Miss Fraser, the
performance of the Prime Minister’s team
must be reckoned quite creditable.
* * * *
“Claypan”: Though the golf season is
officially “off” in Queensland the enervated
children of the tropics contrive to stagger
round the sun- (and otherwise) blasted
courses as if the climatic conditions were as
salubrious as, say, Melbourne in a “norther.”
An interesting competition was decided the
other day, when S. B. Skipper and J. D. H.
Arnott, after tieing for the Walsh trophy,
replayed, Skipper winning. The match was
played under what is known in Queensland
as the “Crane” system. Briefly, if A has a
stroke handicap of, say, 10, he starts 5
holes up on Bogey. This credit is given
him when he returns his ordinary stroke
round, save that at those holes where he is
down to the Colonel he has to pick up. The
idea of the innovation is that it induces
the player to try his hardest to secure
Bogey figures or better, and so preserve his
original advantage. Too many men with a
stroke up at a hole are apt to grow care-
less. It is claimed that the “Crane” system
corrects this tendency, more regrettable in
golf than in any other occupation.
The Ins and Outs
The resumption of the Sheffield Shield
series last week-end was marked by very
heavy scoring. At Adelaide, New South
Wales batted for the best part of two days
to score 519 runs. N. E. Phillips reached
112, and Kippax, whose knock was inter-
rupted by illness, contributed 143. But the
most gratifying success of the innings was the
118 of Bradman, the ex-Bowral batsman,
who, playing his first Sheffield Shield
game, shaped like a tradesman. Scott took
4 for 99. When stumps were drawn on
Saturday evening the South Australians had
also collared the bowling. Harris was c and
b Andrews for 77; K. Schneider (85) and
Vie Richardson (37) were both not out —
1 for 208.
The ascendancy of the batsmen was even
more marked in Melbourne, where Victoria
tackled Queensland. Though he won the toss.
O’Connor, the Queensland skipper, made
the amazing error of sending the home team
in on a perfect wicket. Batting for two
days, the grateful Victorians ran up 793, of
which Ponsford amassed 437, passing the
world’s record score for first-class cricket
(429) established by himself against Tas-
mania. He was 10 hours at the wickets.
Hendry had several lives in compiling 129.
Woodfull was run out for 31, but Ryder
flogged the tired bowling for 70. Amos was
the most successful trundler, taking 5 wickets
for 148, including Ponsford, c and b. Like
Scott, he used to play for Marrickville.
(N.S.W.).
* * sje *
“Barrier”: The first visit of a Sheffield
Shield side to Broken Hill proved a success
in every way, and the apprehensions of the
N.S.W.C.A. as to a possible deficit on the
detour were relieved. The Hill, batting first,
scored 206, Salter making 81 (run out) in
fine style. Kippax, with 79, top-scored in the
N.S.W. tally of 215 for five wickets. Pin-
combe got four wickets for the Hill and
Mailey six for N.S.W.
* * * *
“H.K.: B. J. Kortlang, who has played
a match or two with Manly this season, lias
been a cricketer in many climes. Years ago
he was in the Balmain XI; then the wan-
dering spirit took him to the U.S.A., where
the played for the Gentlemen of Philadelphia.
He visited England with the Gentlemen of
America. Returning to Australia, he figured
in the Victorian side, and made a century
against the Westralians at Perth. He has
since played in Sydney, the West Indies, the
U.S.A., India, Maoriland and South America.
He is a batsman of the Woodfull type.
* * * *
“Mid Off”: The N.S.W. selectors, for
once, turned their eyes to the country when
picking the team to play Tasmania at the
Sydney Cricket Ground in the match com-
mencing Dec. 24. The country representa-
tives fire slow-bowler B. J. Bettington, of
the Hunter River district, and W. Lampe,
from the Riverina. Both did well in the
Country Week games, and as Lampe is a
lefthander he may fill a long-felt want in
the N.S.W. attack, if he can make good.
Young Nicholls, the Cumberland fast bow-
ler, has at long last been giwn another
chanos.
Footbrawl
Playing on a snow-covered ground, the
Waratahs went down at Murrayfield on
Saturday, Scotland triumphing by 10 points
to B—two8 —two converted tries to two tries and a
converted goal. At half-time it was 5-all,
Eric Ford scoring for the tourists and Law-
ton converting, while Graham and Drysdale
performed the same offices for Scotland.
Welsh crossed again in the second half for
Scotland, and Drysdale again added the goal.
The Waratahs then penned the Scots in
their 25 for the rest of the game, launching
attack after attack. Jack Ford crossed,
but Lawton missed the kick, and though
the visitors were all but over time after
time, the Caledonians held them off. Mal-
colm, the Newcastle half, made his first
appearance for the Waratahs in a big game
and did well. Simmers, the Scottish half, w r as
a great factor in his side’s success. Over
50,000 people watched a splendid match.
* * * *
“Past Grammar”: The outstanding suc-
cess of the Waratahs seems to be Tom Law-
ton, who played with Oxford its a Rhodes
scholar, but was denied an England cap
because he was suspected of having once
played League football at Queensland Uni.
He has been a magnificent pivot for attack
and defence at five-eighth, and is certainly
the greatest exponent of the position playing
to-day, while his goal-kicking has been a
powerful factor. Up to the match with Scot-
land, Tom easily headed the scoring-list with
2 tries, 40 goals from tries, 1 field goal and
7 penalty goals : —lls points.
* * * *
“Kiwi”: The All Blacks are not to play
in Australia on their way to South Africa,
after all. Risk of injury, as well as short-
age of time, is responsible for the decision.
The team will reach Sydney on April 17 and
go on to Melbourne the same day, and thence
to Africa. A good deal of heartburning has
been caused in the Dominion by the enforced
exclusion of Maori players in view of the
Afrikander color bar. The absence of Hen-
are may make a big difference to the team,
for all the big Maoriland sides, save, per-
haps, the first All Blacks, have included
Maoris.
On the Parramatta on Saturday the race
for the N.S.W. champion eights was won
by Mosman. Finely stroked by 11. L. Cal-
laghan, the title-holders defeated Leichhardt
by five lengths in 18min. 21 3-ssee. for the
3 miles 167 yards. Pearce captured the
champion sculls in 21min. 28 3-ssec., and
Ilaberfield, youngest of the Sydney clubs, won
light fours from Sydney and Bal-
main.

“Spoof”: The making of motor-car
“records” goes merrily on. “Records” are
put up under all sorts of conditions and in
all sorts of places, and authoritative confir-
mation is rare. For example, it is asserted
that Frank Lockhart shattered every record
from one mile to 100 miles in a receut
attempt at Cleveland (U.S.A.). No details
of the feat are given except the bald state-
ment that the last mile was run at 81 rn.p.h.
—not very astonishing for a special racing
car, the machine controlled. Better time
than that was put up last week by the
Bruce couple, at Montlhery, while trying
to beat Violet Cordery’s 15,000-mile achieve-
ment. These record-breaking attempts should
be standardised. Under the present go-as-
you-please conditions they are quite worth-
less for comparative purposes.
* * *
“Utility”: A really useful car test goes
down to the credit of Captain Stobo, a
Sydney motorist, who recently completed a
2500-mile trip in his Willys-Knight. The
route was from Sydney, via Bourke, to
Aramac (C.Q.) and back, via Brisbane.
Heavy rain in the blacksoil country on the
return journey made it necessary to rail the
car from Mitchell to Brisbane to save time;
the rest of the journey was done under
the car’s own power, the actual running
time being 16 days—no attempt at speeding
was made. Five passengers and luggage
were carried, and the cost of petrol and oil
for the whole trip was only £7 17s. Gd.
* * * *
“Trial”: A decision reached in Europe
may have an important bearing on some
aspects of Australian reliability trials if it
is adopted here. The International Asso-
ciation of Automobile Clubs, representing
25 countries, lias resolved that the minimum
weights for all classes of cars should be
abolished. The reason given was that mini-
mum-weight limits which increase with the
size of the engine make it almost impossible
for big cars to compete with success on
difficult road circuits against medium-sized
nnd small machines.
* * * j;t
“Trembler”: Driving a Harley Davidson
side-car, N. E. Cunningham and E. Crack-
nell have knocked the Transcontinental re-
cord from Perth to Sydney (7 days 11 hours
28 minutes) up among the stars. They left
Perth on Dec. 7, and completed their journey
(2850 miles) in 6 days 2 hours 26 minutes.
The young fellows actually sliced 19 hours
off the run to Adelaide. Their longest rest
during the six days’ run was four hours at
Melbourne.
=i= * * *
“Ball Race” : If the authorities in control
of professional cycling can manage it, an
Australasian team will take part in the
Tour de France, the greatest road race in
the world. Opperman will go in any case,
and it is hoped to send two others ; Maori-
land candidates will bo eligible. Over £7OO
lias already been collected in Victoria alone,
and there is every chance of the required
total of £l5OO being raised. The race will
be run about the middle of June. The
route practically encircles France, crossing
the Alps and the Pyrenees, some of the
climbs running over 7000 feet; the distance
is about 3318 miles. Two classes compete—
team combinations and unattached riders.
The teams are backed and looked after by
the trade interests for whom they ride; the
independents, while getting a little more
latitude as to repairs and the like, have to
look after themselves. The winners of past
races have invariably been members of
teams. Much advantage is to be gained in
the negotiation of the mountain roads, and
there are high hopes for Opperman, who is
an expert hill climber.
“Skyrider”: Australian cyclists are as
tough a breed as there is on the face of the
earth. Practically every rider in the Goul-
burn (N.S.W.) amateur club began his career
on a local shop-bike, or on the one he rode to
work, notably Sieffert and the Grays, whose
fame has spread beyond the Ma State. One
member used to ride 30 miles to a night
meeting, take part in all the big events, and
then ride home on his racing bike. And he
was always at work bright and early on the
farm next morning.
Miscellaneous
"Ride Off”: It may now be regarded as
settled that an Australian polo team will
go to America in 1929. The American invi-
tation was for next year, but the Aus-
tralian organisations found it impossible
to get their house in order in time. On be-
ing apprised of the difficulties, the American
Polo Association, with splendid sportsman-
ship, undertook to pay transport and ex-
penses for 40 ponies and 10 grooms from
where they start in Australia to (and
through) America and back. It is an offer
that verges on the princely.
“Spike" : Jimmy Carlton, the St. Joseph's
College boy (B. 15/12/’27), and B. C. Lane,
the Victorian, will have their work cut out,
to beat Leadbeater, the Canterbury (M.L.)
sprinter, in the Australasian championships
at Wellington. In the contests for the
Dominion titles Leadbeater ran 100 yards
in lOsec. and 220 yards in 22 l-ssec. —ho
has now won the 100 four times and the 220
three times. Carlton and Lane have equalled
Leadbeater’s figures for the 100, and the
Sydney lad has run the 220 under evens;
but the Maorilander will thoroughly test
both our boys.
* * * *
“Hotham”: The last-minute decision of
Hyde, Wliyte and Kroger, three of the Vic-
torian athletic team chosen to visit Maori-
land, not to make the trip has seriously
weakened the Victorian chance of retaining
the Australasian championship. But N.S.W.
athletic scribes see in the happening a
villainous attempt on Victoria’s part to get
more men than N.S.W. into the Olympic
team. The three Victorians will be available
for the Australian trials at Manly on Jan.
7, and it is suggested that the N.S.W. cracks
who have gone to Maoriland will meet the
stay-at-homes at a disadvantage, returning,
as they will be, only a day or two before the
trial. These inter-State jealousies take
humorous forms.
“Bouragi”: Fiji, where good King Thak-
ambau once played bowls with the heads ot
his subjects, is to stage the most ambitious
battle in Fijian history, albeit it will be con-
fined to the bowling-green. The Suva Bowl-
ing Club is making preparations for the
singles championship of the Pacific, no less ;
a first prize of 50 guineas is offered, with
a 10-guinea solatium for the second man.
The South Sea Pennant, which has somehow
come into Victoria’s possession, will also
be fought for, and there Avill be other events
of arresting interest. The tourney should
draw a heavy entry from every bowling club
impinging on the shores of the Pacific, for
Suva possesses a thirst-provoking climate,
and cocoanut-milk mixes delightfully with
all the standard bowling beverages, especi-
ally when a squeeze of lime is added.

scrapers that a stud kennel fer grey’ounds
w'ich is bein’ built in the Ole Dart is t’
’ave orl the latest sientifik whangdoodles t’
induce the dorgs ter do their best. The

“Ilerodot”: A racecourse game very
profitable to the proprietor of the joint
is played with a cricket-ball and two small
wooden pegs, the latter being placed exactly
the diameter of the ball apart from each
other. The aim is to knock down both pegs
at once. On a N.S.W. country course
recently I watched a shabby and furtive-eyed
individual who had arrived in town the night
before under the tarpaulin covering a truck
on a goods train. His only stock-in-trade
was the ball, but he soon secured the two
pegs from an old broomstick handle. Crawl-
ing on to the course through a hole in the
fence he found a secluded

“Don Crew”: American sportsmen are
speculating on what would be the outcome
of an endurance race between a man like
E. T. ROWE, the South Aus. lawn-tennis
champion, who is a Davis Cup possi-
bility.
Nurmi, a racehorse such as Man-o’-War,
and a trotter of the standard of Cresceus.
It lias been proved in England that a man
can beat a racehorse in a six-day go-as-you
please, but a trotter would be a tougher
proposition than a galloper. Apart from an
amble or a walk, trotting is the easiest method
of travelling for a horse: a galloper would
soon wear himself out if he stuck to his
own gait, but not so a trotter. If ever there
is a six-day race between, say, Rose or Hay-
den and Great Bingen, my money will be
on the utility ’orse.
* * * *
“Y.S.A.”: S. Aus. has done uncommonly
well in the inter-State 14ft. dinghy compe-
titions. Boats from the Central State have
won two championships since 1924, besides
being second three times and third three
times. John Nimmo, sailed by the skilful
Brook, is the pride of the fleet, but it will
have formidable allies when the inter-State
races are held in Sydney next month. Inci-
dentally, the Grange Dinghy Club, formed
only two seasons ago, has a fine lot of 14-
footers. snugly housed, a reconditioned life-
boat for a motor craft and a comfortable
club-room, all free of debt.
* tf * *
“Hotham” : Though country rowing bulks
big in Victoria, country oarsmen are nearly
always overlooked when the State eight is
chosen. The Mildura club is heading a
revolt against the present method of selec-
tion ; it proposes a test race open to indi-
vidual clubs and combinations, if districts
agree to combine, the winners to represent
the State in the King’s Cup event, con-
tinuing their training on their own water
and under their own coach. The Victorian
R.A., it is suggested, should pay the expenses
of visiting crews, raising the money by an
increase in the capitation fees of country
members. The complaint of metropolitan
dominance is an old one. Perhaps the best
way for the country clubs to urge their
claims on the State selectors is to beat the
metropolitan boats convincingly at the big-
regattas. Murray Bridge and Mannuin
(S.A.) and more than one Queensland crew
have taken that line with gratifying success.
“Three Bagger”: The visit of an American
baseball team to Australia next ■'’ear is now
assured, arrangements having been made to
bring over the Leland Stanford University
nine from California in July or August.
’Varsity teams are prominent among the
amateurs playing America’s national game;
some of them can hold their own with the
big professional league clubs. Australia has
seen U.S. pros, in action on at least two occa-
sions. The Giants and White Sox, avlio came
on a “missionary tour” in 1914, were the two
best nines in the invincible Republic. But
their brief descent was followed by happen-
ings which turned this country’s attention
from baseball.
Business, Robbery., etc.
“H. Horsecollar”: A person who was very
proud of himself lately put 10 tons of wool
on a motor-lorry, probably imported, and
drove it from Bathurst to Sydney by the
aid of imported spirit. Thus he prevented
the Australian railway earning £3l and made
considerable wear and tear of the Aus-
tralian road, besides maddening an Australian
citizen who had to drive slowly behind him
for 14 miles because the bloated vehicle
kept the “crown of the causeway.” In the
days when the Australian ox-team hauled
sensational loads on an Australian dray there
was more sense in such performances.
* * * *
“C.Q.”: Last year the wire-netting factory
at Pentridge (Vic.) prison turned out 690
miles of wire valued at £31,320, and £26,602-
worth of “new goods” was produced also.
The number of prisoners per 100,000 of popu-
lation in the State has decreased from 80 in
1003 to 57 in 1926 —partly, no doubt, because
young fellows who have taken the wrong
turning are now put in the way of earning
an honest living.
* * * *
“Fray Bentos” : Queensland started some-
thing new in inter-State meat transport
when Redbank meatworks sent a trial con-
signment of beef, chilled by a new process,
in specially fitted railway cars to Sydney.
After several days on the road it arrived in
perfect condition. The market is here if the
quality can be maintained.
* :l: * *
“Adsum”: There is no waste (B.
l/12/’27) about jarrah production. Jarrah
logs rarely yield more than 45 per cent, of
marketable timber, and since the Westralian
Forestry Department started dictating what
trees shall be felled the percentage has often
dropped below 35. W.A. has 900,000,000
super feet of stocks; lots of it might just as
well have gone into the fire-heap considering
its meagre chance of sale. The higher duty
on oregon will cause some inroads into these
stocks, but the daily accretions will more
than maintain the balance.
*.* * *
“V.H.R.”: Unclaimed Tatt.’s prizes for
the years 1920-26 totalled £4592. They used
to be handed over to charity, after a reason-
able effort to find the winners—surely the
most casual inhabitants of a casual country.
The money now passes to the Tas.
Treasurer.
* * * *
“Co-Sec.”: “Aalia” (B. 8/12/’27) is not
fair to the Bank of N.S.W. in complaining
that its fixed-deposit receipts are printed
on Yankee paper. The material used is
“safety” paper, which will discolor immedi-
ately if touched with acid in an attempt to
tamper with the wording. When I wanted
to have special cheque-forms printed for my
co. I ascertained that “safety” paper was
made only in America. Banks make an
allowance to firms which print their own
forms, provided a protective paper is used.
* * *
“W.1.T1.” : The Sydney-Broken Hill - rail-
way has reported its first month’s business.
Inward loading (including a quantity of
material for the railway itself), 881 tons:
outward, 739 tons. For the four weeks
ended November 30 the Silver ton Tramway
Co. carried 84,741 tons, 77,552 tons of that
being coal and lead and zinc Concentrates.
This went to Pt. Pirie. If the N.S.W. line
got everything else (which it won’t) there
would be less than 9000 tons a month to
truck, which might pay for axle-grease.
* * * *
“Skyrider”: In a search for a home I
visited a dozen newly-erected bungalows in
Sydney suburbs. Under each front door a

ment :

“D.E.” : Crystallised fruit has a brisk sale
in Australia at a high price, but, apart from
a bit of pawpaw put up in Queensland
(good stuff, let me say), it is practically all
imported, as far as I can see. Yet the Lord
knows we have fruit and sugar to spare.
There arc possibilities here for clever house-
wives in fruitgrowing districts.
“Coot” : During 1926-27 Vic. Railways De-
partment paid growers £37.743 for fruit.
This year it is expected that more than
45,000 cases of oranges and lemons will be
required. From January Ito the end of
October 1,100,000 drinks had been sold at
Flinders-street station, the record for one
day being 13,000.

The thrilling satisfaction of a holiday in the great Outdoors
—-healthfully, conveniently and economically spent—is withsn
easy reach of the lucky man who owns a “8.5. A.”
Have a jolly, carefree time this year. Spend it in some quiet
spot, good for fishing and' camping—away from the hustle
and bustle of the busy city. And remember, if your mount’s
a “B.S.A.”—the greater, the better, the more enjoyable
will be your fun.
What unlimited opportunity for Sport awaits you! What
unequalled pleasure is at your command! The swimming,
the shooting, the camping, too, all combine to make the
motor-cycle holiday absolutely unrivalled in its complete
satisfaction.
Think, too, of the beauty spots, inaccessible by car or train,
which may be easily reached by motor-cycle. The inconveni-
ence of unhealthy, crowded trains, run to an irksome schedule,
is a thing of the past to the B.S.A. rider. He travels to a
schedule of his own making, in perfect comfort, and at so
little expense.
That abiding satisfaction and value in its truest sense are
linked inseparably with the name i B.S.A. is an accepted
fact!
That so many exacting men elect to continually ride B.S.A.
Machines emphatically proves the constant dependability of
Britain’s Greatest Motor-cycle!
That YOU, too, will eventually see the wisdom of B.S.A.
ownership is a foregone conclusion.
So, why not anticipate your own enjoyment, and MAKE

Nearly 200 members of the National
Council of Women, among them 60 repre-
sentatives of affiliated societies, found them-
selves stirred to regret when they heard Pro-
fessor MacCallum’s lady address them for
tlfe last time as their president. The occa-
sion was the council’s farewell, and the
Union refectory of the University was the
scene. Eight speeches in her praise the
gentle-voiced lady had to listen to, and it was
no wonder that her utterance was not so
calm and unruffled as usual when she rose
to reply. She made an attractive figure as
she stood in grey-blue georgettes, her arm
filled with scarlet gladioli. At the hands of
Mrs. Muscio, the new president, the council
made its farewell gift to the gifted and
earnest lady—a portrait of herself in oils.
Sydney Rotarians had a Christmas party
at the Wentworth. None of your frigid, stay-
where-you’re-put parties. In fact, there were
traffic cops about the room to see you kept
moving. “No parking” was the slogan. The
Jolly Miller was the favorite dance, and
small sons and daughters came along wide-
eyed to see how father and mother’s world
behaved at a party. There w.cre colored
candles on the tables, and Christmas bush
and bells, and Police-Commissioner Mitchell
obeyed the traffic constable with the meek-
ness of any mere man at King-street corner
at five o’clock. Librarian Ifould, who is
president of the club, was head serang of the
revels; but the really important person, of
the evening was Fred Birks, who is a sort
of G.-G. of Australian Rotary clubs. The
flocking of the wives of these plenipoten-
tiaries as of the scores of just-Rotarians,
wms rich and dazzling. And the vocal knock-
out of the evening was “Land of Hope and
Glory,” by the full strength of the com-
pany, led by Mrs. Reid Hill.
Should there be a Society for the Preven-
tion of Compliments to Amateurs? The purr
and coo of friends over this one’s singing,
that one’s dancing and the other one’s act-
ing every now and then sends the mercury
of self-appreciation up to fever heat, and
the result is a positive rash of amateur
entertainments. To be sure they are gener-
ally .in the cause of charity, and family
friends buy the tickets, so no harm is done ;
but it would take a sledge-hammer to knock
the idea that they are Bernhardts, Marie
Tempests, Du Mauriers and Harry Lauders
out of the heads of some of the girls and
boys who have been the People in the Play.
How poor a figure the amateur cuts if
suddenly transplanted to the professional
stage was evidenced not long ago by Mrs.
Pitt Rivers. A star of the first magnitude
she wms acclaimed when she was leading
lady in amateur show's for charity ; but what
a small and flickering candle she v r as w'hen
she first took salary ! All of which remarks
have been induced by “Folly Fare,” the
latest outburst of society amateurs. Under
the direction of Peter Gawthorne, of
“Outward Bound,” a bunch of nice-looking
girls and boys sang and danced and mimed,
and filled the Wentworth with crowds of
w'ell-dressed applause-makers; and as the
Navy League reaps the harvest, what do the
ways of the husbandman matter?
With the advent of the cheap taxi, rain,
even soaking, ceaseless rain can’t keep
young people and a Christmas party asunder.
So a sturdy company of diehards boarded
the Malo.ja when, under the direction of
Mrs. Harry Dransfield, the decks of that
ship turned themselves into Joy-street for
the littlest one and the littlest one’s not
quite so little brothers and sisters. Punch
and Judy came to the jollification, and,
depending on nobody else, brought their
own fun with them. A merry-go-round and
a slippery dip w'ere so overworked that the
bos’n spat thoughtfully over the vessel’s side
and wondered if it might mean another
strike, and then would all the slippery
slides and merry-go-rounds in the world be
declared black? There were mountains of
goodies to eat and drink, all supplied by the
P. and 0., and when the money from the
dips and the lucky caps and balloons had
been added up there was a cosy total to
put to the credit of the furnishing fund for
the new hostel for Sydney’s deaf and dumb.
Chief Justice Street’s lady was the president
and Mayoress Mostyn the vice-president.
Every Christmas every American young-
ster in Sydney is taken to a Christmas party
to which every guest bidden is a citizen of
Uncle Sam. One of the practices is that
each guest takes a present—and it's got to
be a good one—for the poor of Sydney. An-
other is the unfurling of the Stars and
Stripes before the small ones who will in-
herit the Monroe doctrine and the greatest
gold reserves in the world, while the U.S.A.
Consul tells them about the honor of being
born under Old Glory. This years re-
joicing was held at tlie Mary Elizabeth-
the stronghold of the American Sewing
Circle —and the presents handed over to
Padre Hammond for distribution among less
favored little girls and boys made a par-
ticularly fine swag.
Sydney’s manhood has been in the final
throes of a great struggle. Politicians,
merchants and V.C.’s have been seeking to
snatch the bubble reputation from the penny
ballot. The desire has been not to be
acclaimed a strong man, or a winsome man,
or a champion at putting the caber (although
Stewart Dawson has been a contestant),
nor even a screen sheik, though Stuart
Doyle has been among the poll-climbers.
No! Pulses have been running high, and
manly breasts have labored with striving
to convince the public that each is the
ugliest man among the bunch of candidates.
Processions and dinner dances and cabarets
have swept Sydney like a whirlwind —not a
suburb but has had at least a mah-jongg
afternoon. William Morris Hughes was a
candidate, and you might think that settled
the question. But even with a sure thing
you never know till the numbers go up,
though in this case Stuart Doyle looked
a likely winner from the start. The
money from this Ugly Man’s Competi-
tion goes to the Limbless Soldiers’ Aquatic
Club Fund; and it has been one of the best
coin-collecting “drives” of the year, thanks
largely to the pertinacity of the Sun.
“Llewellyn Jones, artist. He lives,” ran
the legend on the laurel-wreath which hung
last week beneath a landscape on the line
in the Australian Court of the National
Gallery. The landscape, typically Australian
(it is named “Dry Season”), is Corot-like in
its brooding quiet. It was painted 80 years
ago by Llewellyn, then studying at the Mel-
bourne National Gallery schools. During
the six years that he was a student he three
times carried off the first prize for land-
scape. But the disappointments that life
holds for the sensitive and the retiring seemed
served to him in double ration ; and although
his work may have gained an added gentle-
ness and contemplative quality thereby, he
never forged ahead to finance and fame as
did at least three of his contemporaries. His
delicate work has for years past, however,
been bought up by a few art buyers with the
discerning eye, among them Monsignor King,
and it was the Monsignor’s hands that hung
the wreath in memory of a great artist who
had lived among us almost unknown.
One of the happiest of all the Christmas
parties was the Blue Bird kindergarten
Christmas tree. The Blue Bird is one of
the prettiest in Sydney. It has a garden and
a wading pool,
and blue birds
on its win-
dows and its
walls, and not
a penny o f
debt to worry
it. The lady
in this new
Talma picture,
Mrs. J. A.
Jackson,
helped to hatch
the joy-spread-
ing fledgling.
For 16 years
she has worked
on the Blue
Bird commit-
tee, Which had
its beginning
in Devonshire-
str.set, in the
stronghold of
the Friends.
Mrs. Jackson can remember the day when
the committee had only two members, with
the late Mrs. Sargood to direct their ener-
gies. Now it is one of the strongest in the
union, and consists entirely of ladies of the
North Shore line. Until recently Mrs. Jack-
son was its secretary, and tells with pride
of its money-making schemes—one is a sew-
ing circle whose fame has gone abroad to
such purpose that orders for trousseaus and
complete stocks of household linen are con-
stantly coming in. At a fete held a few
weeks back the apron stall alone put £55 in
the till. Mrs. Jackson is a vice-president,
too, of the Kindergarten Union.
Perhaps because of his own little knee-
longtli apron the Bishop of Newcastle (Dr.
Stephen), who, by the way, is just about to
retire, feels drawn by a sympathetic cord
to the flapper of to-day. The Bishop, in
an amusing address to the girls of the C.
of E. Grammar School at Newcastle, ex-
pounded the gospel which this Letter has
always preached, that the girl of every age
has been regarded as a flighty piece by her
mother and a perfect young rip by her
grandmother. The Bishop, of course, being
more intimate than The Bulletin with the
old folks at home in the Bible, quoted the
lectures delivered by Eve to her daughters
on their fast behavior and exactly what Eye’s
daughters said in reply. There’s nothing
wrong with the dab of powder and the little
skirt of to-day, his Grace sums up. If the
bishops keep on being human like this
t.liey’ll soon have to enlarge their churches.
Incidentally, Bishop Long, of Bathurst, fol-
lows Bishop Stephen at Newcastle.
The little community of Goat Island had
a wedding the other night, when Charley
Carter, a son of its well-known Captain
Carter, was married. His bride ivas Leila
Shadwick, who came from Hobart and wore
white-frilled georgettes intermixed with pink-
and-white tulle for the give-and-take promises
made at St. Philip’s. The ’groom’s cousin,
Rita Holmes, brought orchard-pink georg-
ettes and a cluster of blue delphiniums into
the picture. The subsequent reception was
held at the Ambassadors, the bride’s cousins,
Mr. and Mrs. W. Nelson, doing the honors.
When Joseph Bradley laid down his baton
on Saturday night after the performance of
“The Messiah” he, completed L's 20th year
as conductor of the Sydney Phil. The 20
years previous
to that he had
spent in Glas-
gow as con-
ductor of the
city’s choral
union, and the
20 years before
that again lie
was busy with
the musical
life of Man-
chester, where
he started his
career as an
organist, later
on to become
conductor o f
Halle’s con-
certs. He is
proud that he
has led four of
Britain’s finest
orchestras —
Orystal Palace,
Halle’s, the Scottish and Queen’s Hall.
The Joseph Bradleys were long the only
couple who owned a family hansom-cab in
Sydney. They stuck to it till all their other
goods were sold. Then they gave it to the
man who had been their driver for years.
They intend to settle handy to London.
To St. Matthew’s at Manly came Arthur
Mann, youngest son of the John Manns of
Annandale station, Gladstone (Q.), to
claim Gladys Simpson as his bride. Gladys,
who is the only daughter of the John Simp-
sons of Manly, wore ivory satins and a
souffle of tulle, and was followed by two
maids dressed in shell-pink tulle. It was a
real seaside wedding—the padre’s name was
Ebbs and one of the maids was Winifred
Beach.
Marion Constance Dare, only daughter of
the H. H. Dares of Roseville, became Mrs.
Charles McLean, of Gordon, at St. Philip’s
one afternoon last week. The wedding was
a family affair, and the bride wore with
her ivory lace and georgette frock a wide
picture hat lined with tbs tiniest blush.
Helen Gilfillan and Doris Witney ’maided
in two tones of pink. The bride’s father
beckoned the guests into the neighboring
Wentworth for the usual toasts.
Stuart Peterson, the black and white
artist whose delicate and imaginative work
has often appeared in The Bulletin, came
back from Maoriland the other week to
claim his bride. She’s a Victorian girl, and
is nearly as clever a pianist as her blushing
groom is an artist. The honeymoon was
spent in Sydney, but for the next few years,
at any rate, the roof tree will hold on its
shingles in windy Wellington.
Sparkling Mollie Fitz Simons, of Chats-
wood, whose late father was an M.L.A., was
linked by matrimony to Percy Colin Munro,
of Remuera (M.L.), on a warm, soft night
last week. Padre R. Grassick drove the
rivets at St. Stephen’s, while a tenor gave
testimony that it was done “For You Alone.”
White satin that escaped from a diamond
side-buckle into the uneven hem was worn by
the pretty bride in conjunction with a
beauty of a Limerick-lace veil, a train of
alternate layers of white and primrose tulle
and an armlet of white gladioli. Four girls
ruffled after the bride in sky-after-rain blue
moires that cascaded into tulle frills at each
side. They wore their heads swathed in
blue tulle, and blue and pink blooms mingled
in their posies. The toasts were drunk with
applause at Burdekin House, where the
bride’s mother, Mrs. John Willis, hostessed
in a de luxe binding of blue and black.
Nell Charley, youngest daughter of the
Philip Charleys of Belmont Park, stayed in
her home town for her wedding to Alan
Harnett, of Cooma. The kirk at Richmond
bloomed with Dorothy Perkins roses for the
occasion, and pink was the color note struck
by all the wedding-garment accessories. The
dress itself was of white ring velvet over
shell pink, ankle length, and followed by a
fan-shaped train of pink tulle; and a tulle
veil wrapped the bride like a rose cloud.
Nonie Robinson and Peggy Bullmore ’maided
in leaf-brown chiffon and wide crin. hats.
Belmont Park housed the rejoicings.
Speech day at Sydney Church of England
Grammar was made a sort of send-off to
L. A. Baker, who has been one of the assist-
ant masters for 38 years—which is just as
old as the school is. Mr. Baker started as
a teacher when he was still in his teens;
and it will be 50 years in January since he
gave his first lesson.
Reginald Kenneth, who came from Eng-
land nearly 20 years ago to add his rich
baritone to “The Blue Moon” production
and decided to settle in Australia, is being
welcomed back to Sydney. Farming has
claimed his attention since he gave up the
stage, but just for love he has kept his hand
in by producing for W.A. amateur societies.
With him he has brought a Perth youngster
named Knowles, who seems fated from his
sheik type of silver-screen beauty to become
Australia’s Rudolph Valentino.
“A.G.M.’s” note from London :
A" link between Maoriland and Guildford, the ol<l
county town of Surrey, is a genial white-haired
waiter at the Lion Hotel, William Philpot, who was
a railway pioneer of the Dominion. His son, a
leading solicitor in Guildford, is now to be mayor
of the town; but though the father intends to efface
himself when any functions take place at the Lion,
he does not mean to retire until he has completed
his 50 years of service.
By the new Legitimacy Act an Australian-born
man comes into a fortune. The case is the first,
of its kind in the High Courts, and though an appli-
cation for a secret trial was made by the petitioner,
John D. Greenway, Lord Merrivale, the president of
the Divorce Division, refused, as there was no ground
for hearing it in camera. Mr. Greenway’s parents
were married after his birth in Australia. The new
Act provides that any child born out of wedlock be-
comes legitimate if the parents subsequently marry.
•Lord Merrivale held the petition legitimate and there
would be a declaration to that effect. Mr. Green-
way now becomes heir under the will of his grand-
father, the late Rev. Charles Greenway.
How time does fly ! One of next year’s debutantes
will be Lady Mary Lygon, the third daughter of
Lord Beauchamp, the last of the bachelor Governors
of N. S. Wales. She is a tall, delicately complexioned
girl of 17, who shares the family characteristic of
regal bearing. Lady Beauchamp is the sister of the
Duchess of Westminster, and Lady Shaftesbury is an-
other relative.
Do Mary Piccaninny and small King Billy
love a doll and a train just the same as your
own Golden-heads and Blue-eyes? Mrs. J. B.
Smith, of Petersham, says they do—and she
knows. As president of the Boomerang
Club she persuaded over 100 women to be
of like mind, and the result has been a
great shower of gifts. So all the small abo.
girls and boys within reach are going to
find that Santa Claus has them on his
visiting list, too.
The Australian woman hasn’t to go so
very far from home to get a thrill at her
back door. Mrs. Latimer, whose husband
is secretary of one of the Rig Australian
companies that are tin-dredging at Taiping,
writes to her home people that the household
has run up for a few days to the hotel on the
mountain that uplifts itself behind Taiping.
It is beautifully cool and restful, she says;
and then, apparently to illustrate the rest-
fulness, she mentions that one tiger was
caught two nights before on the road, and
“last night a fine big fellow was trapped on
the tennis court!”
A correspondent asks if this Letter was
correct in saying that the line “I have a
rendezvous with death” is by an Ameri-
can poet. Alan Seeger, the writer, was born
in New York in 1888, and educated at
Harvard. He was in Paris at the outbreak
of the war, and enlisted with the Foreign
Legion of France 12 days after w r ar was
declared. This Letter can heartily recom-
mend his book of verse, “Juvenilia,” in which
the prophetic rendezvous occurs.
George Fuller’s lady is one of the candi-
dates for the Queen Competition organised
by the auxiliary of the Society of Women
Painters in the interests of the girl artist.
Midway through last week, to give her a
leg-up "the poll, so to speak, the women
painters indulged in a dinner dance. Look-
ing impressive in pale-pink lace and a lasso
of pearls, the handsome lady brought her
knight to the party at the Wentworth.
Joseph Cook Came with his Dame Mary
(none of your modern nonsense about stick-
ing to the same dancing partner for these
two), and president Mrs. George Taylor, in a
black and gold picture frock, made the inevit-
able speech. Mrs. Albert Littlejohn enter-
tained a group of daughter Barbara’s young
pals, and altogether the crowded room looked
as though the popular candidate has .every
chance of exchanging her coronet for a
crown.

A GREAT AUSTRALIAN NOVEL
BY STEELE RUDD.
THE ROMANCE OF
RUNNIBEDE
JUST PUBLISHED.
Steele Rudd has won the regard of all lovers of a clean story,
his latest work, THE ROMANCE OF RUNNIBEDE, will enhance
his reputation as Australia’s greatest writer.
A CONVINCING STORY.
He tells a convincing story of old pioneer days, when they
who flung themselves into the wilderness without experience,
buoyed up only by their giant courage and unyielding faith, fought
valiantly against the ever-present spectre of flood, fire and drought,
and with undaunted hearts faced the spears of hostile blacks. To
these pioneers of old, Australia owes a debt.
MANY RUNNIBEDES.
Steele Rudd now, with facile pen, pays a tribute to their
memory by writing the ROMANCE OF RUNNIBEDE, and places
upon record for all time an authentic story of those early days.
There were many Runnibedes, but few writers have essayed the
task of chronicling their stirring story.
RUDD’S BEST BOOK.
The ROMANCE OF RUNNIBEDE is the finest book that
Steele Rudd has written. It is quite different from his earlier efforts,
wbich depicted the lighter side of bush life. Rudd has given us a
real Australian story with true atmosphere of the bush on every
page—exciting incidents and a charming love story are blended in
what is a really big story.
THE BOOK ITSELF.
It is a special film edition, crown Bvo, cloth, with striking three-
color loose cover and eight one-color illustrations from film scenes.

In Dublin's fair city
where the girls are so pretty*
IRISHMEN the world over have’woven a halo of romance
around Dublin. Poets have delighted to sing, of the queen
city of the Emerald Isle —and the mere mention of ‘ dear
ould Dublin” is sufficient to a lig,ht to the eye and a
panegyric to the tongue of every son of old Ireland.
The faith of the son of Erin in the excellence of everything
which is of Dublin origin is further enhanced by the con-
sistent superiority of a famous Dub-
lin product-John Jameson Whiskey.
For at the Bow Street Distillery,
Dublin, “J.J” Whiskey has been
distilled since 1780, and the same
distinctive qualities which brought
it into immediate popularity account
for its continued preference by
sound judg.es of whiskey after a
lapse of nearly 150 years.

HOTEL WINDSOR
CBPARK & CASTLEREAGH STS SYDNEY
The Austral Salon’s Christmas dance, a
fancy-dress affair, collected a numerous and
brightly-attired company. Shades of gold
mingled with white streamers and flowers
made an effective setting. Mrs. Watson Rob-
ertson, wearing cherry-red velvet and chiffon;
Mrs. Richard Gipps, with floatings of blue
chiffon upon a brocaded frock; and Lionel
Wilson judged the costumes. Annette Lynch,
in a dress of old lace and large poke bonnet
of 1820 mode, and Dr. Sutton, as Dr. Samuel
Johnson, shared first honors. Alice Richard-
son and R. Gordonov, in Early-Victorian
guise, also won prizes. Mrs. R. Lewis cleverly
represented the Salon in attire of gold satin
with a royal-blue cloak. Mrs. M. Quinnell,
the Salon’s hard-working lion, sec., wore
the black mantilla and festal shawl of a
Spanish lady, and Miss Billinghurst made
a vivid splash of color as a pack of cards.
Dr. Dumont Dunn, garbed as a Japanese
student, was easily identified by his friends.
He had his name embroidered on the back
of his robes !
One of the pleasantest social happenings
of the week was the tea-party given by Mrs.
Allen Tye for her niece Phyllis Rankin, and
solicitor Harry Woolf, son of the L. S.
Woolfs of Malvern, who are shortly to
face the altar together. The Tyes’ home in
Anderson-street, overlooking the Gardens
and the Yarra, is fashioned on Spanish lines.
Tea was served on the lawn under a great
awning. The bride-elect, a daughter of the
Robert Rankin couple, is a well-known
pianist and teacher. She wore a dainty
frock of white taffeta patterned in floral
design and a leghorn hat with raffia blossoms.
Cr£>pe de Chine, figured in black, bois-de-rose
and brown, was her mother’s choice, and
Mrs. Woolf’s gown and hat were of navy-
blue. The trio carried presentation posies.
Mrs. Tye’s gown of hydrangea blue and faint
pink was topped by a powder-blue felt hat.
Thelma Neil, Miss Agnew, Lorna Reid and
Joseph Foster entertained the guests with
song. In the ballroom, between items, the
younger folk jazzed and others wandered
upstairs to view the gifts.
Melbourne’s Hospital’s annual end-of-the-
year hop Avas staged in the outpatients’ de-
partment, which was disguised with masses
of feathery bamboo, Christmas lilies and blue
and yellow blossoms. A musical programme
was furnished by 3LO artists, Maggie Foster
among them. President Aaron Danks and
his daughter Annie, the lady superintendent,
Miss Bell, and the medical head, Dr. Keith
Ross, gave the proceedings the sanction of
their presence. Dr. Eric Gutteridge was
accompanied by his wife, Avhose white gown
sparkled with crystal. Dr. and Mrs. Atlee
Hunt and Marjorie Hughes were others of
the profession who joined in the fun.
Students of Albert-street Con. blended
frivolity and the musical classics at their
breaking-up afternoon. Dame Nellie Melba
was there to enjoy the fun. In “The Cauli-
flower,” a comedy sketch by Muriel Camp-
bell, the popular violinist played the leading
role. “Everybody’s Husband,” another
comedy, gave the young people an oppor-
tunity to sport the crinolines and ringlets
of the Victorian era. Beatrice Touzeau,
Ida Walker, Greta Callow and Cora
O’Farrell were among the mummers, and
of course there was singing. Iris Turnbull,
on behalf of her felloAV students, handed a
casket of Australian woods to the diva, who
was greatly pleased at the little attention.
She once again expressed the conviction that
the Con. Avill some day produce a singer who
will astonish the Avorld.
Pentridge came to Parliament House last
week, or rather some of its most notable
products did. It was a revelation to most
members and the visitors they were showing
around to see the great coil of first-rate
rabbit-proof fencing-wire convicts had turned
out, and to be told that it was just a sample
of the £33,000 Vorth manufactured last year.
A warder’s uniform, cut out and finished in
a Avorkmanlike manner by a detainee who
hadn’t done a stitch of tailoring till two
years ago ; suits of clothes for lads in the
State welfare home; rugs, dinner-waggons,
coffee-urns, coir matting and dozens of other
items arrested attention and knocked on the
head the idea that stone-breaking is the Jug’s
main industry. It made members sit up to
hear that prisoners, with official aiding and
abetting, were taking lessons in various
skilled trades by post from a correspondence
school, and the neAvs that grown-ups are
taught by a State teacher was interesting.
Joe Akeroyd, Inspector-General, was him-
self formerly a senior inspector of schools.
An Australian in London writes that in
the Big Smoke’s annual Lord Mayor’s page-
ant Australia was represented by a model of
Captain Cook’s ship, the Endeavour, with a
kangaroo and a small boy dressed to repre-
sent the great circumnavigator, as passengers.
A quaint conceit, but a trifle inadequate as
a representation of Australia.
Mrs. F. Fairley is holding a show of land-
scapes, portraiture and flower pieces in
oils and water-colors, with a few pastels, at
the Arts and Crafts’ Society’s headquar-
ters this week. The society’s vice-president,
Mrs. Oswald Syme, did the launching. The
artist, who was one of Whistler's class in
IPai’is, is particularly successful in portrait
studies of children. She also exhibits speci-
mens of brightly-decorated woodwork.
The sweltering heat of Thursday drove the
Kindergarten Training College garden party
indoors. The Spencer lady, acting president
of the F.K.U., and the principal of the col-
lege, Miss Gutteridge, welcomed tlie guests,
who were regaled with tea and part songs.
Margery Smith received the scroll that
acclaimed her winner of the Norah Sem-
mens Scholarship, and au rcvoirs and good
wishes were showered on Miss Gutteridge,
’who is booked for a 12 months’ tour of
Europe. Amongst those who watched the
prize-giving were Mayoress Morell, in a black
gown softened with lace and a black hat:
Sheila Morell, looking cool in green and
white; Mrs. Arthur Austin and Mrs. G.
Blanch.
The Playlovers’ Club’s final performance of
this year at the Unitarian Hall was a bright
and interesting one. Two scenes from “Lady
Windermere’s Fan” were capably played by
Hetty Feuerman and Miss Wilson, and A. A.
Milne’s sketch “The Boy Comes Home” was
capitally presented by the same talented
amateurs. A paper on the drama was read
by Mrs. E. C. Davidson, who dabbles in
play-writing. Helton Daniel, who should be
of great service to the club, made his first
presidential appearance.
Groupings of white lilies and delphiniums
decorated the new quarters of the Quamby
Club when Mrs. Lucius Conolly, daughter
of Mrs. Graham Falkiner. arranged bridge-
tables for many guests. The young hostess
was attired in black lace mounted on pale-
pink georgette, her mother surmounting a
beige frock with a large black hat. Mrs. J.
Moffat Graham, Mrs. Keith Klingender, Mrs.
Robert Power, Marie Mackinnon and Margot
Best were among the players.
Grammar School Chapel was filled with
white lilies and purple irises and a big
crowd of onlookers when Marion, only
daughter of Mrs. T. Travers, of Toorak,
swept up the aisle in white crepe georgette
embellished with seed pearls and a Limerick
lace veil falling over a tulle train, to receive
a plain gold circlet from Harold Austin,
second son of the E. G. Austins, of Boori-
yalloak. Margaret Cumming and Joan Mc-
Arthur, her maids, wore frocks and hats of
spring green shades and carried shower
bouquets of pink water-lilies.
Last week, at their Christmas party, mem-
bers of the Arts and Crafts Society said
good-bye to their secretary, Mrs. Stewart
Murray, who for the last five years has done
all that a
good secretary
could do to
make the
society popu-
lar and pro-
sperous. The
lady, pictured
here by Mina
Moore Tainsh,
has seen the
society’s pre-
mises expand
from a small
room in Capi-
tol House to
the spaciou a
quarters in
which exhibi-
tions are held
n o w a d ays.
Mrs. Murray
has resigned
because her
husband, a n
architect, is transferring to Bendigo. Pier
chief regret is that she will not be in office
at the coming-of-age celebration of the society
next year. Mrs. Eleanor Moody takes up the
secretarial quill.
Enid Joske, daughter of Dr. and Mrs. E.
S. Joske, who last week was appointed prin-
cipal of Janet Clarke Hall, is not able to
fully enjoy her elevation. Returning a few
days ago from a holiday tour of the Malay
Peninsula, Manila, China, Honolulu and
other places, she had the misfortune to slip
on the Avet deck of the boat after leaving
Maoriland, seriously hurting her knee. The
injured limb is still in plaster of Paris, and
its owner receives congratulations mingled
with condolences. An M.A. of the local
Shop, the new principal is one of the former
residents of the Trinity College hostel. She
was for some years teacher of English at
Lauriston, and founded the first library for
children in this State at Prahran.
Mrs. Norman Menzies is staying at Men-
zics’. Before her marriage to her late hus-
band she was Dorothy Vane, an attractive
■petite soubrette who played many parts. Her
best r6le Avas in “La Poupee,” but she had
many successes in opera bouffe. She looks
as charming as ever, and younger than when
she was last in Australia.
This is Golda Ehrenberg, a writer Avho,
under the name of Catherine Scott, has just
had her first novel published. Though she
has never had a line in print before, the
local represen-
tatives of Hut-
chinson’s sent
the manuscript
to London
with a favor-
able opinion,
an d accept-
ance was
made by cable
as soon as it
arrived. She is
a product of
the Methodist
L a d i e s’ Col-
lege, and her
experience nas
been confined
t o Australia
andMaoriland.
Xow, of course,
she dreams of
a literary
career in Lon-
don and the
dream may come true. A Lafayette camera,
caught this glimpse of the lady.
Sir Arnold Theller, a Swiss, who has been
invited by the Development Commission to
visit us early in the New Year, is bringing
with him a blonde Swiss wife, fond of
social activities., She will have plenty of
opportunity to play around while her famous
husband investigates our live stock. Sir
Arnold has been a South African resident
for many years. While in Australia he will
be associated with Dr. J. B. Orr, an Aber-
donian who specialises in food values. They
will say what they think can be done to
improve our pasturages.
Captain Hugo Tlirossell, V.C., and his wife
—she is known in Australia’s literary world
as Katharine Susannah Prichard —returned
to their home in W.A. last week after look-
ing up friends in Sydney and this city.
Mrs. Annie Godfrey, a link with old Mel-
bourne, who passed over last w 7 eek, was a
member of the Martin family. Her brother,
Irvin Martin, was at one time this State’s
sheriff, and David Martin, another brother,
held the Public Works portfolio for a while.
Her husband, the late George Godfrey, was
a member of Vic.’s Uppah Chambah. He
settled in a St. Kilda home in 1864, and his
widow died there. She took an active
interest in philanthropic movements, and
was for a while a vice-president of the
Women’s Hospital. Two of her sons, Ernest
and H. C. Godfrey, practise law in this city,
and another, a medico, holds a Government
appointment. The daughter of the house
became the wife of Dr. S. Ewing.
The news that Lord Lovat will be a visitor
early next year has vastly agitated our
Scottish clans, and mothballs are being
shaken out of kilts in mony a hame. He’s
one of the great chiefs of Clan Fraser, and
has seen a lot of soldiering. He founded
Lovat’s Scouts in the S’African scrum, and
furnished a Highland mounted brigade in
the European mix-up. He can boast a
D.S.O. and the rank of Major-General, but
he comes to Australia on the peaceful task
of promoting inter-imperial migration.
The well-liked D. G. Macdougall, for
many years Alfred Hospital’s secretary, is
to leave us. Sydney Chamber of Commerce
has grabbed him for its new research and
publicity department. A farewell gathering
is being arranged.
Bunnie Beatty’s friends have received word
that she and her mother are boarding a liner
for Australia and will be here next month.
May Beatty, who has been playing to New
Yorkers, has signed an Australian contract.
Trilby Clarke, who left this city for
Hollywood to become a screen star but found
studios overstocked with sparkling red-
haired girls, took to the stage in the Cold
Country, and had a fair amount of success.
Now she has broken into Filmland by
another door. A scenario of “Marie Mar-
tin” is being shot in a Sussex village, and
the young Australian has been chosen for the
name part, which she had played on the
stage in the provinces.
The bright sparks of our younger set who
have been engaged in making a film version
of “Robinson Crusoe” are resting from their
labors and having a gay time on Mrs. Ernest
de Little’s Western District squattage.
Phyllis Holmes-Hunt, who will presently be
seen on the screen in a straw petticoat as
Crusoe’s feminine Friday, is one of a party
which also includes Mary and Quentin
Winter-Irving and young Trevor Clarke.
Mrs. Treacy has decided to take her
husband for a holiday abroad early in the
New Year. He is one of the officers who
trained the first unit of the R.A.N., and
proved their mettle in the Big Scrap. She
is one of the mainsprings of the Friendly
Union of Sailors’ Mothers and Wives.
Kew City Council, which tries now and
then to act like a feudal baron, is proposing
to take compulsorily the old-fashioned home
of David Carnegie, the musical-instrument
magnate, for a new civic centre, and to
offer him £BOOO. As Carnegie is attached
to his home and uses every room of the
straggling place for his family and the
entertainment of his friends, the high-handed
proposal of the council has aroused indigna-
tion. Fortunately for the Carnegie family,
Works Minister Jones has a say under the.
Local Government Act, and he has given a
broad hint that it will have to be proved to
him that a new Town Hall is an urgent
necessity, that there is no other site avail-
able, that ordinary negotiation has been
tried to the utmost, and full value offered,
before he will be a party to an eviction. It
looks as if Mr. Carnegie’s house will con-
tinue to be his castle.
The Christmas gift problem is once more
being faced, and the task of choosing some-
thing at once attractive and original gets
no easier as the years go by. It is only
in little art shops—mostly sequestered in
arcades —the Arts and Crafts depot, and such
places as the Melbourne Book Club and
Clieyne’s that the shopper who seeks the
unusual and artistic has some chance of
success. The exquisite wood-work of Elma
Roach and her sister, and the ceramics of
Merric Boyd, Philippa James and other local
potters are a safe buy, if one can afford
them, and crystal charms embalming a tiny
landscape or flowers in relief are becoming
fashionable. They are dangled from dull
silver cords, and are a refreshing alternative
to strings of pearls.
Women have taken to the club habit as
congenially as a cat laps milk, and every
feminine resort of the kind in this city has
so many members it hardly knows what _to
do. Each enlargement of premises is fol-
lowed by an overwhelming rush of waiting
applicants for membership. With men, on
the contrary, club life seems to be on
the decline. The mid-day meal attracts only
a thin muster, as most of the members may
be seen having a cheap snack down town.
Never is there the bustle in the lunch-hour
that prevails at the portals of women’s sanc-
tunts.
Violet Jackson, formerly a Uni. Con.
student, has been engaged as one of the
principal singers of the Gilbert and Sulli-
van opera co., at present touring Maori-
land.
Mrs. Frank Carse has decided to remain
abroad for a while and has divided her small
family. Daughter Alice is returning with
her grandparents, the F. P. Bretts, of South
Yarra, and little Esther will be her mother’s
companion during the remaining period of
exile.
A performance of one of Coward’s com-
edies was staged at Christchurch Hall on
Friday night to help the Melba Free Kinder-
garten. Norman Simpson was the producer
and Mrs. Elizabeth Apperly headed the cast
of clever amateurs. Dame Nellie brought
a party and gave some well-earned praise
to the performers and a cheque to the kinder-
garten. Stalls of flowers and sweets with
an auction or two were run profitably.
Arthur Turner, elder son of the Charles
Turner couple of Brighton Beach—he lately
spent a year abroad studying motor engineer-
ing—has secured the promise of Doris May
Stapleton, an English girl.
Jessie Traill is making a bid for immor-
tality with a series of etchings of Sydney's
great harbor bridge which, when complete—-
they won’t be complete till the bridge is—
will form a record of every stage of progress.
She visits Sydney periodically to make
sketches.
The making of Christmas gifts at home
has turned many households into what looks
like a continuous Dorcas meeting. Needles
are being plied upon coat-hanger covers,
handkerchief sachets, aprons of all shapes
and sizes, powder-puff bags, doyleys, mats
and pretty coverings for condiment bottles
and jam-jars. In mansion and in flat and
beneath the shade of the trees in the gardeus
the work goes on relentlessly.
Over from Pretoria, S’Africa, on a holi-
day are the Norman Ogilvies and their
family. Her sister, Muriel Ker of this city,
mustered the Austral Salonites and some
other friends to drink a welcoming brew in
Mrs. Ogilvie’s honor. Molly Mackay and
.Mrs. F. Earp sang, and there were recita-
tions by Alba Zacutti and items by a string
orchestra.

That natural beauty of skin and hair which cannot be imitated can
be obtained by regular use of Rexona Skin and Facial Soap. Ordinary
toilet soaps do not assert this influence. Many of them contain free alkali,
which tends to dry the skin and destroy its delicate texture. Even the best
of such soaps can only cleanse; they cannot heal and protect the skin.
Rexona Soap contains the same soothing, healing, antiseptic balsams as Rexona,
the Rapid Healer, the value of which in the treatment of skin affections is known
throughout the world.
Simply use Rexona Skin and Facial Soap regularly once or twice a day and
see if it does not quickly soothe and cleanse the pores, lessen the tendency to
pimples, and leave the complexion clear, fresh and velvety.

i J. Pluvius has be.en a bountiful Father
Christmas to many a drought-stricken farm
in the Central districts, and if the farmers
on the Downs have some cause of complaint
in a matter _of over-watered wheat, there
are paeans of’ thankfulness further out.
The Goodwins went to the Christmas fes-
tival at the Anzac Hostel, which had been
beautified by the Red Cross Society with
flags, gold coreopsis and brass jars filled
with pink hydrangeas. The v.-r. party was
received by Miss E. Wassail, Mrs. G. H.
Howell, Matron Bell and others. Mrs. E.
R. Gross fixed up the musical programme,
to which Mrs. P. J. Symes, Mrs. Espie Dods,
Jean Mactaggart and Miss Auld contributed.
The Junior Red Cross served supper.
Sir John and Lady Goodwin went to the
races in between attending Christmas festas
at hospitals. To match the grey skies, her
S ,J ?own was of grey and petunia,
ihe W. J. Hoopers entertained the v.-r.
party, which included Colonel and Mrs.
Campbell. Mrs. Hooper was in black silk
repp, Mrs. H. St. ,J. Tyrwhitt brightened
things with rose-pink, Naera Sampson was
in brown and amber, Tessa Reading wore
ivory and a blue hat, Mrs. Arthur Clark was
in black and Mary Stopford was in love-
green.
'Roma Hunter, daughter of our former
Agent-General and of Mrs. J. M. Hunter,
of Hamilton, was another December bride.
St. Andrew’s kirk saw her wedded to Lance-
lot Bressow, of Brisbane. The bride was
m white mariette over silver, and her train
of ivory was lined with silver. Her veil of
tulle, edged with lace, was lent by Mrs.
Garth Billington. White roses and stephano-
Us made the bouquet. Her cousins, Chel and
Jessie Moffatt, of Charleville, ’maided in
pink, with turbans of pink and silver and
posies of roses. Mrs. Hunter received at
Rowe’s in a frock of black georgette.
The Ipswich Thistle Pipe Band played
the Lament for Alexander Macgregor this
week. In his eighty-ninth year the veteran
went quietly out in the presence of his
family. One of his sons is Peter Macgregor,
the well-known barrister. Alexander Mac-
gregor was a building contractor in a large

Between wool sales and parties the Harry
Dawsons, of Bradford, have had a busy
week in this city. Known here a few years
ago as Jeanne Alcock, Mrs. Dawson has been
renewing school-girl friendships. The couple
are now in Melbourne, and propose returning
to the Old Dart in March.
Edwyna Ross, of Claremont, has passed
her final in dentistry, being the first woman
to qualify in this State.

After 44 years as an officer of the Bank
of Australasia, A. M. Corbett, Perth man-
ager and inspector for W.A.. has decided to
take a rest. He has been in this city for
nine years, and is well liked, even though he

Speech days and prize-givings are raging
morning noon and night, and this is the
middle of a heat wave. Uni. Commemoration
Day brought the usual brilliant arrav to
the stage at the Elder Hall, and the Kofi
and a host of graduates donned colorfu
hoods and gowns for the occasion. But the
hot weather has driven most of our naicest
to the hills or the seaside, and society is
taking a rest from frivols.
The unveiling of the memorial to airman
Ross Smith was one of the most impressive
ceremonies in our civic history. Lieut.-Gov-
ernor Murray revealed the memorial, which
is the fruit of shilling subscriptions, and
Keith Smith arid his lady were among the
lookers-on. Mrs. Andrew Smith, mother of
the famous brothers, is at present in the
Cold Country.
The Floating Palais is taking advantage
of the thermometer to introduce a Lido Night,
when dancers will have their choice of
kimonos and pyjamas. It is thought there
will be few kimonos. Councillor J. S. Rees,
also in tune with the mercury, is sending
out invitations for a mixed-bathing splash
at the City Baths.
The hospital grounds were gay when
Mayoress Bonython opened a fete organised
by the Women’s Auxiliary to erect a
woman’s block. The auxiliary has already
built a kiosk in the grounds, which has made
things more cheerful for patients and their
friends, and its soul goes marching on. The
Moulden lady is its president, and Mrs. T.
R. Scarfe vice-president.
At Helene Taylor’s second concert she was
assisted by the Adelaide Glee Club. Opera
is undoubtedly her forte, as her perform-
ance of Puccini’s “Si mi chiamano Mimi”
(“La Bohbm.3”) proved; also her singing in
the “Miserere” scena from “II Trovatore”
with Keith Clarke, to which the Adelaide
Glee Club gave tonal background.
Polo started at Birkalla on Saturday—no
invitations; just an informal affair, with
Frank Downer as host at afternoon tea.

E.V.: Sorry, but that tank is dry....
Elouera: Good stuff in “Drought.” It deserves to
have the humps taken out of it... .R. Ham: Not well
plotted J.G.: “Who?”- Why? Irene W. :
“Bondage” is tiresome. . . .Cam D. : We liked this
best:—
Beautiful thoughts were alive in his cranium,
Of roses and snowdrops, mignonette and geranium.

“Death and Burial of Sir John Moore” as a
basis. What’s the matter?... .E.J.C.: Rhapsody on
beer left us thirsty... .W.T.W.: No need for the
staccato commencement. The men’s over-concern
with what was to them a mere yarn makes for un-
reality.... Bis L.: The girl fell over the cliff, bump-
ing rocks on the way, and then “lay beautiful in
death, a gentle smile on the poor pale face.” A
miracle !.... A.M.H.: Disastrous effort... .Ethel Y.:
Stumbles badly here and there... .B.B.: That last
stanza is like a prehistoric geography lesson.... Cul
G. : Your hero made one mistake. He died in the last
par. He should have done it in the first... .Nell E.:
“Canberra” is a dry subject; no wonder the verse
is arid. .. . J.M.D.S.: No literary value... .8.E.D.:
It can’t be done; rather cheap, anyway... .J.11.L.;
Quite nice; but not up to the standard of. print....

and work. Study good poetry, and you may succeed.

admirable thing about them.... H.G.M.: Being
patriots, we decline to rhyme “failure” with “Aus-
tralia”. .. .8.L.M.: What “The Garbage Tin” hums
is not a tune.... Bob Bols: W T e simply hate the
writer who finds it “a task to pen these lines.” The
stuff that sells has no hint of anybody writing it.

Evolve! Runs so fire, human, exotic;
Dost thus raven black night,
Stars lighted to the height
In fearful force despotic
Go on. Nay, pause! Inventions may
Turn darkness into day;
Coagulate is Fate
With thoughts come soon or late.

too late... .P.P.S.: Your fancy that “hours” and

“Purple passion puts its pain upon Pan’s plea-

The Commonwealth could desire no better

“W.1.U.”: However somnolent officialdom
may be over the correspondence on its desk,
it certainly sits up and takes notice of cold
print occasionally. Since the publication of
the Bulletin par. about the Broken Hill
branch of the State bank observing local
instead of State time, instructions have been
given for it to join the associated banks in
keeping to N.S.W. time, the alteration to
date from the New Year, when it begins
business as a rural bank.
“Toby C.”: Touching these rewards of
free-lancing, I am indebted to Tiie Bulletin
for a cow. Two different departments
helped. The accountant posted six bob to
my address for a paragraph. Five went on
the sporting tipster’s Epsom choice, Yaals.
Twelves was the quote at my hairdresser’s,
and the scene now shifts to the local sale-
yard. “Young and sound and coming to her
work fast,” remarked the auctioneer as he
knocked Blossom down to me at 60 bob.
Copious rains have since fallen in our dis-
trict, and my milker is worth a tenner to-day.
“Alwyn” : In November, 1842, Henry Fal-
wasser, that pioneer Maoriland pressman,
printed the Auckland Times on a mangle.
This resourceful litterateur had come into
conflict with the authorities in Auckland,
and they seized his printing-press. Nothing
daunted, he got together a few odd bits
of type, some wrapping paper, and the
domestic implement aforementioned and pub-
lished several issues, which deserve to rank
among the curiosities of newspaper litera-
ture.
“Lone Wolf” : Speaking of short-lived boys’
papers (B. 8/12/’27). In addition to Pals,
the pup of the Melbourne Herald, the Boys’
Weekly, fathered by the Sydney Daily
Telegraph, lias come to grief in the absorp-
tion by the Sun of the Daily Tele-
graph interests. The issue of 16th
December was the last. The Australian
Federal Council of Boy Scouts is keen on
publishing an All-Australian Scout paper,
but it is up against the same trouble—the
impossibility of getting a steady flow of
advertisements. The boy has little or no
value from the advertiser's point of view.
“Lao-dah”; The Argus isn’t given to
sensations, but it scored a curious sort of
scoop the other day. It published what is
believed to be the first photograph ever
taken of a lake not much more than 170
miles from Spencer-street. It is Tarli
Karng, and lies in a deep fold of the Gipps-
land mountains near the top of Mount
Wellington. There is only one spot whence
it can be seen, and only a handful of stock-
men can take you to that spot. The photo-
graph was snapped by a member of the
Boy Scout party, which has just performed
one of the stillest “hikes” in Scout history,
with tlie State Governor’s strenuous co-
operation.
“A. Jack” : Dick Gully, who stung Barrier
Daily Truth for £l2O and costs for libel,
is the chap who has been agitating, in the
face of the opposition of the heads, for the
miners’ union to close its books to Southern
Europeans. He fought with the Bushmen in
the Boer War, and it was while referring to
this that the paper published a letter from
.J. J. Porter, president of the district assem-
bly of the Australian Labor party, concern-
ing the bayoneting of women and children
which gave cause for the action, the respon-
dents including A. C. Willis, “owner in trust
for the W.1.U.”
“Cubmaster”: Melbourne dailies have
started a silly season controversy about the
word “hike,” as a result of Lord Somers
going for a Boy Scout ramble in Gippsland.
and innumerable correspondents have
written to deplore the Americanisation of
this country. Actually, the word, like
scores of other “American” expressions, is
good old English which has merely been
revived in the land of the wooden nutmeg
after becoming obsolete in Britain. Funk
and Wagr.all schedule “hike” as provincial
English as well as local U.S., and Collins's
Clear Type Dictionary, published in Glas-
gow, gives “lmik,” meaning to walk about
in a leisurely manner.
When recently the Hop Memorial number
was printed many inquiries Avers made for
“On the Hop,” the collection of “Hop’s”
drawings made and published in 1904. To
satisfy this demand a second edition of the

was undertaken ; and it is now on sale at

which includes all “Hop’s” famous car-

to 1000 copies; and these can be had from

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
There are folk whom no protest or gibe’ll
Induce, one iota, to stint
The parade of the Family Bible;
But let them get wind of a hint
Of a large and lascivious libel
Purveyed by a prurient print.
And, as rapid as thought, the whole tribe'll
Be hot on its trail at a sprint.

From four to six cylinders—and
then to Knight-engined cars
Owners of four-cylinder cars are changing to six cylinders for better perform
ance. Now another advancement in motor performance is causing owners of six-
cylinder cars to buy motor cars powered by the famous six-cylinder Knight
double sleeve engine.
That same feeling of quicker and smoother power experienced in changing from
four to six cylinders is again felt by owners who for the first time sit behind the
wheel of the Falcon-Knight.
Due to simplicity of design the Falcon-Knight engine delivers smooth, quiet, un-

The least suggestive bedroom staged in
modern times is the apartment featured in
“The Cuckoo in the Nest,” which opened at
the Sydney Criterion on Saturday. Peter
Wykeham, an amiable silly ass, misses the
train which takes his wife Barbara and was
to carry himself to a country house-party,
in consequence of heedlessly indulging in a
conversation with a lady on the platform.
The lady is also to be a guest at the house-
party ; but Barbara does not know her.
Directly the train gets to its first stop Bar-
bara alights and makes back home, where her
story rouses the worst suspicions in her
mother; meanwhile the unsuspecting Peter,
believing his wife will proceed to her des-
tination, is tearing the country in a motor-
car with the other lady as his companion.
An accident lands the pair at a tiny inn at
Maiden Blotton run on Baptist lines by a
landlady who is such a dragon of virtue that
she proudly relates how she turned into the
storm a couple she discovered to be unmar-
ried. Fear of a similar happening causes
Marguerite Hitchett to allow the landlady
to cherish the delusion that Peter is her hus-
band, Claude Hitchett, M.P. This mild
deception entails some embarrassing results
when it turns out that there is only one
disengaged bedroom in the house. Peter’s
embarrassment at the situation and his fear
that his wife, whom h.e dearly loves, will
hear of the escapade, with the lady’s cool
composure as a foil, leave no room for un-
pleasant suggestiveness in the bedroom scene,
even although Peter, having gone out into
the pouring rain on a knightly errand con-
nected with Marguerite’s pet dog, which the
landlady has insisted upon locking in the
stable, is forced to discard his damp gar-
ments. The midnight entrance of his aveng-
ing mother-in-law who has brought her hus-
band with her to catch Peter in the act,
and who certainly has strong circumstantial
evidence of the justness of her suspicions, is
the climax to his night of suffering; but
the arrival next morning of the real Hit-
chett, M.P., Barbara, and the Reverend Sloly
Jones, a motor-biking parson with a genius
for adding to the embarrassment of embar-
rassing situations, helps to create new
tangles. These are adroitly unravelled by
the time the laughter of the theme has
exhausted itself.
% H*
An admirable casting of the parts adds
value to a sparkling comedy. Cyril Vernon,
as the genial Major Bone, father-in-law
to Peter, gives a fine rendering of the gentle-
manly semi-drunk who holds the view that,
even in a son-in-law, an amorous escapade
may be regarded as an amiable weakness;
Leslie Victor, who is the embarrassing
minister, and J. B. Athelwood, as Noony,
are responsible for two other excellent
character studies; Atholwood’s appearances
are brief, but his rustic is an artistic cameo.
Hastings Lynn plays Peter Wykeham so
lightly and easily that the preposterous
situations in which he is involved seem
natural enough; he is a devoted young
husband too absorbed in the embarrassments
of liis predicament to entertain a single
amorous thought about the attractive lady
who is his room-mate. The attractive lady
aforesaid is Helene Simon, who makes Mar-
guerite, a modern young woman, convinced
that her own comfort is the first considera-
tion ; serene in her rightful possession of
the bed, she coolly advises Peter how to be
comfortable on the draughty floor. The
virtuous landlady is effectively played by
Minnie Rayner ; Vera Gerald is the exponent
of the mother-in-law joke ; and Willie Clifton
is a yokel barman in a tavern where busi-
ness must suffer severely from the employer’s
Puritanic views.
Although the Manufacturers’ Exhibition
at the Sydney Agricultural Ground had early
bad luck, the crowds started to increase
directly the wet weather passed; by the
time the Exhibition closes, on Saturday, New
Year’s Eve, the turnstiles should have told
a cheerful tale. It is all worth seeing, from
the automatic machine which eats strips of
wire and passes out showers of nails, to the
complicated work of the printing press. And
there are, of course, the bands —the Com-
monwealth Band among them —and the side-
shows. There is nothing more absorbing than
views of a film in the making, and the crowd
has the experience of acting in a “Captain
Starlight” story. The films are being
screened as they are made, at the motion-
picture show which is part of the exhibi-
tion.

“The Film Girl” will be the Sydney
Empire Theatre’s contribution to Christmas
festivity; “Tweekie” put away its dolls last
night (Wednesday) to clear the stage for
the new arrival on Saturday night. Most
of the principals, including the Australian
girls, little Audrey Lewis and Gwen Matthews,
who were pushed up from the chorus, trans-
fer to the new production. Muriel Starr
returns to the Palace Theatre on Christmas
Eve, too, with yet another mystery play. It
is called “Cornered.” The active partici-
pation of the J.C.W. firm in the production
is shown by Beatrice Day, Barrie Livesay,
Mayne Lynton and B. N. Lewins being in-
cluded in the cast as well, of course, as
Harvey Adams. “Wildflower” will bloom
for another week; on New Year’s Eve “The
Girl Friend” will introduce at Her Majesty’s
some more new people, including Annie Croft,
the reputed owner of a particularly seduc-
tive smile. The sadness of farewell is
usually protracted when a popular success
is on the eve of withdrawal; but the Last
Weeks sign is now up for “The Terror”
at the Royal. “Archie” will see the New
Year in at the St. James, where its popu-
larity remains unabated. As a result, Syd-
ney will lose one of its Christmas-time
pantos; the only offering of that kind is the
“Mother Goose” venture of Frank Neil at
the Grand Opera House. Neil has aban-
doned the idea of running day-time panto,
and night-time drama; the drama is post-
poned, and “Mother Goose” will flap through
the usual afternoon and evening sessions.
Linda Foy is to have one of the leading
parts.

Christmas theatrical fare must make flesh

The ghost story has gone out, but at St.

Eve, the Grand Guignol is to be introduced
as a special Christmas show. The depend-
able Gaston Mervale is one of the leading
spirits in the venture, and another is Floie
Allen ; there are to be five plays on the one
bill.

Jim Gerald and Co. will indulge in “Pan

Eve ; in the meantime they are keeping physi-
cally fit by antics in “The Tennis Club.”
Jim Gerald and Harry Burgess share the
laughs; but Betty Lambert, who is making
good progress, shines brightly also. Ray
McLean provides some whirling dance speci-
alties, amongst other extraneous items.

Having definitely established that it is
quite unnecessary to import American bands
by a success over several weeks which
rivalled that of the Santreys, the Tom Katz
Saxophone Band moves out of the Sydney
Tivoli this week. The remarkable Owen
McGiveney will continue to scintillate, along
with the new arrivals Armstrong and Phelps,
a moderately amusing pair billed as “Two
Boys from Hollywood.” The gap in the
programme will be filled by an hour of pan-
tomime.
“Seventh Heaven” will fade out at Sydney
Crystal Palace to let in “Resurrection,” the
picture version of Tolstoi’s book, on New
Year’s Eve. “False Shame,” at the Adyar
Hall, is devoting still more sessions for
women, who prove the best customers for
this sort of fare. An amusing side-show is the
solemn person who sits in the vestibule with
a bottle of brandy and glass to provide a
pick-me-up for any feminine patron who may
be overcome by the picture to the extent
of faintness. The Barrie productions,
“Peter Pan” in the afternoon and “A Kiss
for Cinderella” at night, will begin at the

Monday night, with some illuminating re-
marks by Commander H. T. Bennett.

Melbourne’s rejuvenated Town Hall was
opened on Thursday in the middle of a
heatwave with a concert by the University
Symphony Orchestra, the Philharmonics,
Eileen Castles, Walter Kirby, Alexander
Raff, pianist William James and other
popular identities. The average Town Hall
audience is the sort which regards the strik-
ing up of the music, especially if it is a
pianoforte solo, as a signal for general con-
versation ; so writer cannot say much yet
about the acoustics of the new hall, except
that what the lady two seats away said
about the old man’s drinking habits was
perfectly audible. The soft notes of violin-
ist Cecil Parkes playing “Zephyrs,” however,
carried excellently, the lady two seats down
having paused for breath, so matters in that
direction look promising. Nor was there
any sign of an echo. There is no doubt
the decorators have been most successful.
The gloomy rectangular cave of former days
has been replaced by a much larger square,
lightly and airily tinted. The gigantic heroes
and divinities with whom Napier Waller
has covered the walls were generally ad-
mired ; what they were all about was a topic
for comment and their lack of clothing a
subject of hopeless envy. The lighting is
, a notable improvement. It is no longer
a night attack on the nerves by the shock
troops of the electrical industries. The
ventilation system is nothing if not vigorous.
It took six months off the life of The
Bulletin’s permanent wave in the course
of a busy evening.
* * * ❖
At the Melbourne Majestic this week a
Celtic pavement purveyor of sausages is en-
gaged in a business tussle with a son of the
Chosen Tribe who retails ice-cream. The
battle for each other’s customers becomes
fiercer as each hundred yards of the film
unrolls and the plot grows more in-
volved as the son of the latter falls for the
charms of the former’s daughter. An Elinor
Glyn comedy, “Ritzy,” helps to fill up the
bill at the same house. Norma Shearer, as
“The Demi Bride,” makes her exciting way
to the altar and matrimony at Hoyt’s, and
“The Devil’s Saddle” provides thrills for
punting patrons.
The approaching Christmas season should
be an uncommonly festive one theatrically
for Melbourne children of all ages. Robin-
son Crusoe,” at the Princess, will present an
island threatened with a serious popula-
tion problem, owing to the number of attrac-
tions to be accommodated on it. Infants
of modest means will find an inexpensive but
lively entertainment at the Playhouse—
“ Mother Goose.” The management solemnly
contracts to present each child attending
matinees with a bird. “Queen High will
be a Gorgeous Galaxy of Girls and Gaiety,
also a Dream of Delirious Delight, at the
Royal. “The Alarm Clock” will commence
going off nightly at the Athenaeum on Satur-
day, and “Peaches and Pairs,” another
comedy, will be ripe for plucking on the
same date at the Palace. Of solider sub-
stance, though not too solid for the season of
the year, will be “The Letter,” admirably
produced by Mr. Boucicault and excellently
acted by Miss Vanbrugh and others, at the
King's. “The Student Prince” will continue
to pour the rich cream of song over the
marmalade of sentiment at His Majesty’s,
per medium of the beautiful James Liddy and
the enchanting De Vries. And finally the Di
Gatano revue co. will have a new bill
of froth and frivol at the Tivoli, and the
Stiffy and Mo. ditto will be at its old undress
at the Bijou.

Beresford Fowler repeated “The Fires of
St. John” at the Queen’s Hall on Friday,
by special request. The person who would
call for the repetition of even a stage con-
flagration in Melbourne on a day like Fri-
day would ring for more coals in Sheol.

Adelaide theatrical attractions are still
scanty. “Spring Cleaning,” billed for Christ-
mas Eve, has been cancelled, Margaret Law-
rence having gone to America; Pat Hanna’s
Diggers at the Garden Theatre are the only
J.C.W. offering for our many Christmas
visitors. There isn’t even a pantomime. On
December 15 the ’Varsity boys gave their
annual commemoration concert at the Prince
of Wales and the fun was fast and furious.
William Anderson opens at the Grote-street
theatre on Boxing Day, featuring Nellie
Bramley in “Anne, 100 per cent.” At the
Majestic the clean humor of Robert Roberts’s
Revue Co. finds a poor substitute in the
dubious stuff handed out by George Storey,
Charles Zoli and the Storyettes; a clever
comedian like Zoli might aim a bit higher.
At West’s Pictures Jack London’s “The Sea
Wolf” goes swinging on the screen, with
“Rough House Rosie” for the supporting
comedy. Real drama is being screened at
the Wondergraph in “Captain Salvation,”
and “Banana Culture in Australia” is full
of interest.
“L.H.P.”: “Robinson Crusoe” is chiefly
used theatrically for frivolous purposes—-
witness the Fuller panto in Melbourne —but
there is a serious play on the subject by
Isaac Pocock. It was produced at Covent
Garden in 1817; Grimaldi made a hit as
Friday. Pocock provided Defoe’s hero with
a wife, an idea later adopted by a French
dramatist, Decourcelle.
“H.P.”: Gertie Cremer, now at Sydney
Palace, did fine work as a youngster in
“The Bluebird,” and, later, as Jessica to
Moscovitch’s Shylock. Her father, Brandon
Cremer, startled the Shivery Isles in 1896-07
when he introduced an elaborate Folly Bal-
let into an amateur production of “The
Pirates of Penzance.” He also added a
Poonah dance, whatever that may be, to give
“The Mikado” a leg up.
“Caesar’s Ghost”: Australia’s interest in
the “What Price Glory” film is chiefly in
Ted McNamara, who, when he was a kiddie,
was one of Pollard’s Lilliputians. McNa-
mara had a couple of good parts in Neiv
York. Taking on film-acting he was merely
a fill-up until his comedy work in “What
Price Glory” caused its managers to rush for
their fountain-pens. Now they are using
him, with his comedy partner Sammy Cohen,
as stars in a new picture “A.W.O.L.” —
which, in the plainer Digger language, would
be simple “A.W.L.”
“Flaming Youth”: Reita Nugent adds her
name to the list of Australian girls who
have found London waiting with open arms.
She is understudy to Gertrude Lawrence in
“Oh, Kay!” in which John Kirby provides
the principal comedy, and she supplies a
couple of solo dances as well. Another suc-
cess was Isabel Wilford’s step into the shoes
of Tallulah Bankhurst in “The Garden of
Eden” when that leading lady fell ill. Isabel
is a daughter of M.L. politician T. M. Wil-
ford, and had experience with J.C.W.’s
before going to England. No wonder other
Australian girls feel like venturing over-
seas. Nina Devitt leaves this month for
London ; and Floie Allan, who is also pack-
ing her trunks, makes a beeline for New
York in January.

cation of the year. The edition is limited to

Poverty
Point
“Hamfat”: Evidently 1928 is to be a
strongly competitive year in the theatrical
business. After a mark-time period follow-
ing the withdrawal of Hugh Ward, the
Fullers are coming back with “Rio Rita,”
for which Gladys Moncrieff has been
engaged, and a grand opera co. in rivalry to
the Williamson importation. The Rufe
Naylor proprietary will be putting on shows
to keep both its Sydney and Melbourne
houses going. E. J. Carroll is running
English productions of pieces intended for
Australia. Frank Neil and William Russell
are also expanding. But Frank and Bill
work, to some extent, in alliance with old-
established firms.
“Cauboy”: There are worse stage jobs
than being a moral reprobate. Madge White,
a musicomedy lady here 12 months ago, had
to chase a piece of soap in a bath-towel
nightly during a season in Melbourne. The
stage had been specially lathered for the
occasion, and for 10 minutes or so Miss White
skidded on her ear, turned somersaults and
smacked her spine on the boards with a
resounding noise, while the crowd bellowed.
“If I could only get laughs in the easy way
of Irene Vanbrugh!” she used to remark
ruefully, as she contemplated her bruises.
“Hamfat”: The death of Christie Simon-
sens removes another link with old theatrical
days. As advance-agent and front-of-the-
house manager for Bland Holt he was one
of the best-known figures in Australian stage-
land a quarter of a century ago. When
Bland Holt retired cheery little Christie de-
cided that it was time for him to retire also.
He had been living at Springwood (N.S.W )
for years when the curtain fell.
“C. 8.”: The presentation of “Robinson
Crusoe,” the Fuller panto., at Melbourne
Princess, is a domestic problem. The five
principal perpetrators all come from the
one family. They are the Dick-Dorothy Trio
and Edgeley and Dawe.
“A.G.M.” (Lond.) : “Home Chat,” Noel
Coward’s new play, had the worst press
notices ever given to this young writer for
the stage. The piece is said to have been
written in a week, and one can well believe
it. It is brilliant in bits, pointless in by-
scenes, too daring for some tastes and not
daring enough for others. But it draws
well. For that Madge Titheradge is en-
titled to a good share of the credit, though
she has had much better chances to exhibit
her talent for comedy.
“Baton” : Rudolf Friml, whose “Katinka”
score first brought him into prominence as
a composer, is still gathering in big royalties
from “Rose Marie” and “The Vagabond
King.” These two hits were founded on
successful plays. Friml has now taken in
hand “The White Man”—an American
drama seen in Australia about a quarter of
a century ago—for musical treatment. “The
Vagabond King,” by the way, w r as said to
have been acquired by the Rufe Naylor syn-
dicate. It will shortly be done here by the
Williamson firm.
“Flaming Youth” : “What Price Glory!”
has the inaccuracies characteristic of Ameri-
can war films. For instance, the “Mother’s
Boy, ’ going into the line, asks the French
girl to “take care of my letters from home.”
Army post offices had their own methods of
delivery, and the young woman would have
had no chance of seeing missives she was en-
treated to preserve.
C. Ma”: R. Allen, an Adelaide film exhi-
mror, has returned from Asia with the news
rfis,t China, tired of alien pictures which
. onend the Oriental point of view,” is mak-
ing great strides in the production of native
plays. Films are being turned out from
Shanghai in considerable numbers, and it is
probable that soon they will be seen in Aus-
tralia. The notion is, of course, that this
country, having passively accepted the slush
that America sends, will accept Ho Lee Dud
with the same cheerful resignation and that
soon All Mix or Chap Lin will be chasing
chickens with a hatchet and performing
other feats of derring-do on every screen in
the Commonwealth. Still, there are limits
even to Australia’s patience.
“Old London”: “L.H.P.’s” reference to the
dramatisation of “Michael Strogoff” (B.
3/12/’27) recalls the fact that Charles
Warner played the name-part in the English
version—to his regret. On the first night at
London Adelphi during a dagger-fight with
the heavy man Warner was wounded severely
in the right hand and never afterwards re-
covered the complete use of two fingers.
“L. de R.”: There is a world of difference
between the sham realism of Leon Gordon’s
production of “White Cargo” and the
genuine realism of Boucicault’s staging of
“The Letter.” The veteran’s attention to
detail shows in a dozen ways, but one will
suffice. Every native servant skins off his
white tunic the instant he leaves his master’s
presence in order to save laundry bills. He
is in the habit of leaping to the word
of command, so that he usually makes his
appearance still buttoning the thing up.
In “The Letter,” the Malay “boy” comes on
performing this action to the life. Some
spectators thought he had missed his cue.
“L.11.P.” : I handled the other day a pro-
gramme of Covent Garden Theatre, dated
Oct. 19, 1810. The plays for the night were
“The Iron Chest” and “The Bridal Ring.”
Other nightly changes for the week included
“King John,” “Gamester,” “Henry VIII.,”
“The Road to Ruin,” “The Revenge,” plus
short operas of “The Woodman” type. What
a week’s feast for the theatre-goer! The
names of Charles Young, the Kembles and
Mrs. Siddons were in the same-sized letters
as those of the lesser artists.
“St.J.G.” (Lond.) : “The High Road,”
Frederick Lonsdale’s new play at the
Shaftesbury, is thought to redeem the Lon-
don stage from the blight of piffle that has
fallen upon it. The plot is one of the oldest
in the playwright’s toolbox —the love of a
young nobleman for an actress —but surprises
virtually make a new thing of it, and the
witty dialogue really fits the characters. The
particular hit is Fred Rowe, as a domineer-
ing British peer. Lonsdale, now 45, has
sampled life in many fashions. He has been
private in the army, a.b. in a full-rigged ship,
steward on a liner, and farmhand in Canada,
among other things.
“W. Spokeshave” : Vaudeville has changed.
Time was when there was in every pro-
THE LEADING LADY HAS A SECRET WEDDING.
gramme at least one panel of lugubrious dit-
ties, usually provided by a rusty baritone
with a seedy dress suit and no visible sense
of humor. Audiences simply won’t stand it
nowadays. The other afternoon in a variety
hall in Melbourne a gent, as described above
began liis turn in this way. Before the
house could reach for its pennies, however,
he lowered one eyelid and glided impercep-
tibly into this: —
There was a young- lady of Plassey
Who reckoned her singing was classy,
But she nearly expired
When her tonsils backfired
And blew her teeth clean through her chassis!
He was forgiven !
“Y.Y.”: Jean Forbes-Robertson, who went
through her stage novitiate here on her
mother’s tour four years ago, is already con-
sidered a London front-ranker. The verdict
of good judges is that she unites the intellec-
tual quality of Forbes-Robertson to> the
emotional appeal of Gertrude Elliott. Early
next year she and ma will join the old Vic.
company. This is apparently becoming, a
recognised course of temporary intensive
training even for foremost West End players
“Peter Pan” : A year ago I wrote a P.-P.
par. commenting on the fact that the Mel-
bourne Athenaeum had hardly known a
failure, though shows of all types had held
the boards there. The same; good fortune
has continued throughout 1927. “Meet the
Wife” did big business at the beginning of
the year, and “The Best People,” which had
passed the century a few months before, was
profitably revived. Then “The Ghost
Train” reached its century (it also is back
for a revival), and the Zillah Bateman co.,
if only moderately successful with “The
Unfair Sex,” scored a hit with “Eliza Gomes
to Stay,” intended as a stopgap for a couple
of weeks. “Outward Bound” was heralded
by more gloomy predictions of disaster than
any production of recent times. But it
proved a money-spinner at the Athenaeum
and was revived in another Melbourne
theatre a few weeks ago. Back for the
third time came the Hawaiians, followed by
“The Last Warning” with a very satisfactory
run. Which is it—luck, or shrewd picking
on the part of the Carrolls?
“Gallery Gal”: What is funny about
adenoids? In two recent comedies the
authors introduce the complaint in their
dmlogue evidently in the belief that it would
bring a laugh. Somerset Maugham, who
as a medical man as well as a playwright
should know where the guffaw comes in,
makes his Caroline give as an excuse for
not having any great affection for her
husband the fact that he “had adenoids.”
On the night I was present in Melbourne
the audience received the “witticism” in
painful silence. An evening or two later I
heard the same wheeze introduced in “Our
Wife.” This time it was a supposititious
“aunt” who was ill with adenoids. Again
it misfired. They might do better if they
tried corns.
“M.G.S.” : It was certain to be an Ameri-
can firm which would conceive the project of
offering a prize to anyone who would com-
plete Schubert’s Unfinished Symphony. The
world generally regards the “Unfinished” as
incomparable and sufficient to entitle the
Viennese to a perpetual pass to Valhalla.
The person who tries to complete it will
need to be as great a composer, and it is
doubtful whether such is living. He will
also have to recapture Scihube'rt’s mood
when he wrote it, to be equipped with the
same- gland arrangements, to suffer under
the same repressions and have the same
experiences of women and debt-collectors
stored up in his sub-conscious. But a man
who had all that wouldn’t want to finish
anyone else’s symphony. He would waiff
to symphonise for himself. However, a
prize of £4OOO is hanging to the proposal,
so hundreds are certain to make the
attempt. Later on Ford or somebody might
offer a reward for restoring Venus de
Milo’s arms.
“P.H.L.”: “Ruddigore” pokes fun at the
English nautical dramas of the early nine-
teenth century, when T. P. Cooke was
reckoned the ideal impersonator of the
British tar. Some of these pieces, like
“Black-eyed Susan,” could bear revival to-
day. One has only to read “The Pilot”
(founded on Fenimore Cooper’s novel), “The
Flying Dutchman,” “The Wizard of the
Wave” and “The Red Rover” (another
Cooper novel dramatised) to realise the pos-
sibilities in the hands of a clever producer.
“Hamfat”: The film-factories are busy
putting a lot of old dramas on celluloid.
In some cases, however, they merely take
the titles; tips has been done with “The
Shamrock and the Rose.” The piece was
a popular Irish drama of its day; George
Rignold played it in Australia, with Charlie
Westmacott, Williamsons’ general manager,
in the role of the dandy, Arthur Fitzil-
lington. In the film the story of the English-
Irish conflict is set in the poorer regions or
New York.
“Cliche”: No biographer of G. P. Huntley
has recalled the fact that the perfect imper-
sonator of the Silly Ass originated a gag
which swept the continent with a virulence
hardly surpassed by that other calamity
“Yes, we have no bananas.” It was in the
“Three Little Maids”; when one of the
heroines poured out the stained water Hunt-
ley made the fatuous remark: “Bai Jove,
how beautiruTly you do it, what? Raiglxt in
the middle of the cup every taime.” It
was a wonderful opening for Hie knuts of
those days, and from one end of Australia to
tlie other waitresses wilted under the strain
of having to listen to the imbecility.
“L.”: Little wonder that there are dis-
putes about the date of original London pro-
ductions. Take, for example, Buckstone s
melodrama. “The Flowers of the Forest. ’
produced at the Adelphi. Clement Scott,
in his “Drama of To-day and Yesterday,
gives it as January 25, 1845; and Barton
Baker in his “History of the London Stage'
says 1849. The piece “printed from the
Adelphi prompt scrip” is published in “John
Dicks’ Standard Plays,” and the date therp
is March 11, 1847 —probably the correct one.
To Australians “The Flowers of the F'orest”
is associated chiefly with Madame Celeste,
who played the part of the gipsy Cynthia
in Sydney, at the old Victoria Theatre in
3866. The piece, like Buckstone’s other
Celeste play “The Green Bushes,” was kept
alive on the Australian stage in the ’eighties
by Eloise Juno. Since then both pieces have
been shelved.
“C. Coral”: On one of the islands of
Torres Strait recently an outdoor play, witn
music and dancing, representing the landing
of Captain Cook at Endeavor River, was
given by islanders. Beneath tall, feathery
cocoanuts sat singers and orchestra, two
boys holding aloft a big calico “scene” de-
picting the Endeavor lying at anchor. Into
the open space encircled by the audience
came "Captain Cook,” a big islander attired
in full rigout, carrying a handkerchief as
a signal of peace. In the bush at the
“wings” a party of aboriginals, fully painted
and armed, watched every action. They
advanced cautiously and made a feint at the
explorers, whose body of “marines” —they
carried wooden muskets, the uniform being
painted on bare skin —had been kept in the
background. After much by-play, gratifica-
tion of native curiosity, avowals of peace and
feigned attacks, the two parties swore eter-
nal friendship, and danced together around
“Captain Cook.” It was a real Australian
show in a real Australian setting, and
worthy of a wider audience.
“Hamfat”: Our company was doing the
“smalls,” dodging past the bigger town
centres, the managerial explanation being
that this paid better with less risk. At Cow-
flat the front-of-the-house man came round
breathlessly just as we were about to start.
“There’s a man in front,” he began, “who
says he has come all the way from Tamworth
to see you.” Bullroarer, our actor-manager,
was visibly pleased. “There you are, ladies
and gentlemen,” he said, proudly. “All the
way from Tamworth! Sixty miles to see
me! I have served may public faithfully,
and I know they love mull; but it is not
of-ten one gets such a trib-bute!” He was
going on enthusiastically when the front-of-
the-house-man cut him short: “He’s a
Sheriff’s officer down about a hotel bill you
left unpaid.”
“H.E.R.”: Our one and only production
was “Life’s Wine,” billed as “James Barrie’s
latest masterpiece.” But poor houses con-
vinced the manager that the play was above
the intelligence of the out-back audiences,
so he changed the whole aspect of the
drama. When I read my re-arranged part
I nearly collapsed. “Look here,” I pro-
tested, “this J. M. Barrie is a big bloke in
the Old Country, and if he gets to know of
these changes he may haul us through the
courts.” “Go and study your part,” snarled
the manager. “Barrie never wrote ‘Life’s
Wine’; I did !”
“Caesar’s Ghost”: There have been all
sorts of stage caricatures of actors, but the
old pro. in “Judge Not” is the best thing of
the kind I know. This me! drama was writ-
ten to assist a campaign xor lunacy-law re-
form in England, but survived on its intrin-
sic merits. One of the characters, David
Garrick Jones, pervades the five acts asking
the others if they have sv-er seen his Hamlet.
Receiving the answer No, he tells them they
h-have not 1-liv.ed. It was one of the George
Rignold productions in this country.
“Adsum”: The showman enterprising
enough to give Australians grand opera in
English would be amply repaid. "For over
40 years the Carl Rosa Opera Co., working
on those commonsense lines, has been an
institution in such cities as Manchester,
Liverpool, Glasgow and Belfast, and bar-
rels of money have been made in America in
the same way. Let us have opera in our
own language, and the charge of want of
appreciation will have to be withdrawn.
“Hamfat” : An actor friend managing his
own show decided to mingle advertisements
with the stage performance. Thus “The Blood-
stained Butter-knife” was interlarded with
information to the effect that th.e comfortable
saddle-back chair had been bought at
Rookem, Chipper and Stuffer’s, that the
heroine’s complexion was due to Faker's
toilet soap, and that the villain scorned to
smoke anything but Windlass cigarettes.
The innovation wasn’t popular. The climax
came one night after a stage death. “Poor
old man!” said the butler. “Casket and
Sons buried him, and they gave him a
remarkably fine funeral on their easy-instal-
ment plan.” My friend always blamed a
rival undertaker for starting the ensuing
riot; but he cut out the advertising frills
forthwith.
“Murrungurry”: I have known several
good aboriginal musicians and singers. One
night a sweet-voiced chorus attracted me to
a camp of mostly-naked blacks on the Mara-
noa (Q.). Round a fire sat half a dozen
gins singing popular songs of the time, among
them “Sweet Marie” and “Daisy Bell.”
Those gins had better voices than many of
the music-hall people I have heard. In the
Lismore (N.S.W.) district was a Binghi
known as “Concertina Charlie,” whose musi-
cal attainments made him welcome at bush
dances. The concertina was liis favorite
instrument, and on it he could beat any of
the district whites, but he could also play
the clarinet. The bush blacks feared him;
but one day some of them sneaked into his
bark humpy while he was away at work. On
the bunk was Charlie’s concertina. One
curious intruder grasped the strap to pick it ■
up, but as he lifted it the strange thing
creaked and groaned. He dropped it in a
fright and jumped back. The others clustered
at the door, their eyes glaring with astonish-
ment. Then one knocked it over with a
waddy, and again the instrument protested.
At that they bolted for their lives, believ-
ing that a debil-debil was inside it.
THE INTERVAL.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Whenas my wife has me in thrall
At movies, theatre, music-hall
I do not mind the show at all;
Eyes shut, old memories I recall—
But I can’t stand the interval.
In days of yore one could slink out
With Smith and Brown, and quaff a stout
Or gin or whisky. Jones, good scout,
Would tell his latest, and, no doubt,-
All four of us would have to shout.
But now—what hopeless misery!
A magic-lantern show we see—
Toop’s ale and ladies’ lingerie,
The new brick pub at Ballybree
And hose, six foot from toe to knee.
On pit and gallery, circle, stall
My restless optics sadly fall.
Life’s full of vinegar and gall
O’ershadowed by a fun-sral pall.
I do not like the interval.

Hillier's Choc’s
The Taking of the King’s Ward.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
BELOW the river terrace set
The poplars lit their autumn fire ;
The south wind wailing, cold and wet,
Among the sedges seemed to tire
Before it reached the quiet place
Lost in green haze below the trees
A water with a leaden face
That lapped the castle’s sullen knees.
Black arches over steps of stone
Made sodden shadows chill with age;
The walls gave back a hollow tone
To the quick footsteps of the page.
The lank, pale sentry at the gate,
Dull yellow hair about his ear,
In armor as of carven slate
Stooped on his serpent-hafted spear.
Above, at narrow slits of gloom,
Were hidden arrows winged to fly—
Barbed messengers of sudden doom,
Each servant to a watching eye.
The dripping battlements, o’ergrown
With weeds, like shaggy brows were seen ;
And drooping cliffs of mason stone
Were slimed with orange and with green.
It seemed a nest for some harsh bird
Of iron beak and talons grey
That cries by night a dreadful word
And sweeps on pinions black to slay
The sleeping sweetness of an hour;
Yet, as those gloomy steps could tell,
It held within its iron power
The lovely lady Isobel.
I filled the hour with trembling breath,
And blew a blast that all might hear.
Arms clashed a sudden call to death ;
The sentry stiffened like his spear.
But in my gliding boat I stood
And held my silver token high—
By Mary’s crown and Holy Rood
A very fearful wight wrns I.
“Grace for a messenger,” I cried;
“The Lord of Brandon’s word I bear.”
I saw a pale page, wondering eyed,
Bend gaping from the upper stair.
The yellow parchment at my belt,
The silver token on my hand,
The weight of dungeon gloom I felt,
Yet dared beside the gate to stand.
Slow moving with an iron tread
The guard with halberts lined the stair;
The gate on hinges rusted red
Made a harsh crying on the air,
Then clanged behind me. Fear and doom
Seemed heavy in that evil place
Till, like a rose in morning bloom,
Beneath the arch I saw her face.
The Warden, heavy-browed and grave;
The Knight of Elder, cold and keen ;
The black-browed Pedro, fool and knave,
About her as a court were seen.
Harsh gaolers these who served the King
In darker deeds than men should tell;
They looked upon my token ring—
The Warden muttered “It is well.”
But she looked once into my eyes
And all her color died away.
Grey mists about me seemed to rise
I heard the heavy Warden say:
“The Lord of Brandon for the King!
This trusted gentleman and knight
Is sent our lady ward to bring
To Brandon ere the morning light.”
The Knight of. Elder read the word.
“It is the King’s command,” he said.
“We keep no more our close-caged bird
Nor know we whither she has fled.”
He laughed an easy laugh and cold.
“My homage, lady! You are free.”
She shook her hair of waving gold
And strangely did she look on me.
I took the Warden by the sleeve.
And whispered softly in his ear.
“We start our journey, by your leave;
The sooner done the less to fear.”
He turned from me as if in pain—
“ The doors are open ; do your will.”
The Knight of Elder laughed again—
“ ’Twill be a moonless dusk and still.”
As in a dream, the lady drew
Her cloak about her on the stair.
Cold fear was in her eyes of blue;
We passed and reached the freer air.
My boat went gliding down the flood
Between long lines of autumn flame;
And fruit of eglantine, like blood,
Cried out upon my traitor shame.
My traitor shame! The stolen ring,
The scroll well forged deceived them all.
How soon their hands would itch to fling
The masquerader from the wall!
They deemed my hand would work a deed
Of murder in the sombre night
And darkly slaughter for a meed
The lady of my heart’s delight!
We passed the bend and out of sight
Of that grey castle’s mouldering hate.
I said, “Dear maid, in their despite
We win this little trick from fate.
I forged the scroll and forged it well;
We fooled them all with open eyes.
O lovely Lady Isobel,
I think that I have earned my prize.”
“Gee, shake it up!” the lady said,
“I m catching cold in this wet mist!
Here! Go more easy with my head ;
You gave my neck a horrid twist.
Come on. The close-ups must be done.
Don’t maul me as you often do.
I’m sick of being wooed and won—
And more .especially by you.”

“A rotten picture, I should say”—
K.Hisht °f Elder’s voice was bland,
rhe black-browed Pedro, where he lay
On the broad couch, upraised his hand.
The waiter brought the moisture due.
The M arden spoke in accents cold •
“The crimson trouble with you two
Is that your tricks are growing old.”
But whether stars are old or young
They, always twinkle as of yore
That picture on the great screen flung
Made flappers fight to gain the door.
They loved me better than their cash •
And at our long five-minutes kiss
Their mmgffd sighings with a crash
Fell like a surf on shores of bliss.

A Martyred Hero.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A BRIGHT velvety afternoon. You re
working on your cowyard, bringing
it up to date, putting in round stuff,
throwing out sheets of old iron and curls of
ironbark and scraps of barb-wire. Old ilm
Ryan and Young Bob McCleverty are giving
you a hand. Old Tim will be standing paw-
ing his whiskers, recalling the massacre oi
station sheep in ’6B, on the very spot where
your homestead stands, and young Bob will
be standing taking it all in. while you re
grunting and straining to hold up the heavy
end of a mighty sapling-rail that will bruise
the feet off you if you fumble and let it drop,
when suddenly Rover will let the world know
that a sulky with two ladies in it is making
for the front door of the home. Their appear-
ance will be a surprise. Old Tim, in the act
of demonstrating a squatter dodging a flying
spear, will break off suddenly to glance round.
Young Bob will put his head through a panel
of the yard and discover “It’s Mrs. Juba Lee
and Josie King.”
Ghost! You’ll drop the mighty sapling
with a crash and jump back bursting to call
them a pair o’ dam’ fools. But you won t
get your intentions recorded. Instead, you'll
smile through the blood that’s rushing to
your face, and stare with them at the move-
ments of the sulky. It will stop at your
front verandah —you haven't got a back one
yet—and Mrs. Juba Lee, who has charge of
the reins, will be looking about for sight of
you.
“They’re lookin’ for ye, Dickie,” Old Tim
will suggest, concernedly, and Young Bob,
with a rising temperature because they might
drive across to the yard, will urge you to “cut
over quick, an’ see them, an’ me an’ Mister
Ryan will be putting up tli’ next panel.”
Then he’ll bend slowly over the sapling that
you dropped, and be looking back between
his legs for Old Tim to co-operate. Though
lie’s Young Bob, he’s fairly old, and has a
shyness equalled only by your own about
meeting women when they’re dressed up.
“Yes, gahn, man! Galm!” and Old Tim
will attach himself to the sapling alongside
Young Bob.
So you’ll crawl out of the enclosure, cast-
ing perturbed glances at the dirt on yourself
and tightening your belt. And as you slouch
along the crooked little track that you and
Rover and th’ ’possums have worn, you’re
lost in an abyss of discomfiture; your cour-
age falls like the leaves of a tree; you’re in
a sort of dream, and you look down at the
red ants going along ahead of you, and com-
ing forward to meet you ; and while you walk
on them as if they had no feelings, and no
right to live, you wish to heavens you could
be turned into one. Just when you’ve only
ten or twelve more yards to cover, and the
wind sporting with the drooping leaf of your
old hat will show you the two women sitting
under their flashing red and blue parasols,
watching you coming, and the horse pricking
his ears at you, you’ll suddenly remember
having burst the seat of your pants strain-
ing to up-end a gatepost before Old Tim and
Young Bob arrived to give a hand. Mighty!
You don’t know if your shirt is protruding
through the rent or not, and it’s too late now
to put your hand behind to feel. And, con-
scious all at once of the gentle breezes find-
ing their way to your bare skin, the aperture
will feel enormous, and it will prey on your
mind.
“Hello, Mister Dickie Gall!” Mrs. Juba
Lee, who has a pleasing way and a charming
informality, will greet you. She’s one in a
roomful is Mrs. Lee. What you’ll answer
won’t be clearly heard by them—nor by your-
self either—and you’ll lift your hand as if
you were going to stop your hat from flying
off instead of raising it. Then Mrs. Lee will
be sorry they didn’t notice you were working
at the yard or they would have driven over
and saved you the walk. And she’ll ask,
“Don’t you know Miss King—Josie King?”
Of course, you know her in a sort of a way
—you used to see her about the home when
you worked for Old Silas, her father; but
you didn’t look right at her because you
were propping yourself as close to the horse
as you could squeeze on account of the sud-
den trouble on your mind. And the flush-
in your face, and the shaking of your hands,
and the shortness of your speech will all be
put down by them to your modesty. They’ve
heard you talked of as very modest.
Crossing your legs to steady yourself, and
looking like a section in a dog-leg fence, your
eyes will meet Josie’s by accident. And,
what will be surprising, she’ll be smiling
down at you. She, who was always reckoned
proud and stuck up, and was never allowed
by her father to speak to working men! And
she’ll show such a set of teeth when she
smiles that you’ll want to see them again.
Flashing her large, motherly eyes around
the homestead, Mrs. Lee will mentally note
your methods and habits. In a glance or
two she’ll measure you as correctly as a
cobbler would measure you for a pair of
boots. She’s been through a lot of pioneer-
ing herself has Mrs. Lee—worked beside Juba
in the fields; lived with him under canvas;
shed gallons of tears over his shattered
hopes; helped to make a man of him in the
end. She’ll take stock of your improvements,
and the plan you’ve laid out the little home-
stead on.
And while you’re uncomfortable because
you can’t think of anything to say to Josie
she’ll rescue you by breaking into admiration
of the splendid avenue of trees you have
formed by leaving the gums that were grow-
ing in line with each other and grubbing out
the others. Not having noticed your ingenuity
and sense of the artistic before, she’ll be full
of enthusiasm. She’ll infect Josie with it,
too, and the combined compliments and the
smiles they’ll give you will make you blush
more than ever; and you’ll grin and shake
your head till you forget all about your
pants.
You’ll be going to uncross your legs, too,
to square yourself and put out your chest,
when by chance you’ll look down and catch
a view of your shadow. Holy! You’ll see a
part of you projecting and moving when you
move like the ear of a calf. For a moment
ybu can’t make out what part of you it is.
and you’ll be wondering, till suddenly it will
explode on you like a bomb that the tail of
your shirt is hanging out. Laws, what a
start you’ll get! And how you’ll change your
position, dropping your hands by your thighs

and spreading out your fingers! And you’ll
be wondering if they noticed it.
But it’s substance not shadows that in-
terests women. So Mrs. Lee, enthusing
more, will remark the simple, handy way
you’ve hung your gate ; and the patent boot-
scraper you have. Your little vegetable
garden, too, and fowl roosts, will take her
attention, and you’ll begin to feel proud and
comfortable and be getting _ carried away
again. But when Josie, who’s been looking
round, is suddenly taken with the patent
armchair on your verandah, shaped out of a
hollow-log, the approbation they both bestow
on it is nearly your undoing. Without think-
ing you’ll turn right round to look at the
patent yourself; but all at once you’ll front
face again, and look up into their faces, with
your eyes blinking, and your hands twitching.
Changing the subject, Mrs. Lee will start
pulling at her glove, and telling you what it
is they’ve really come to see you about.
Miss King and she are collecting a little
money to give the school kids over their wuiy
a Christmas treat. And she’ll give you
to understand that they haven’t called to
dun you, but they’ve come out of respect and
as a courtesy. Mrs. Lee knows to the six-
pence, pretty well, what your farm revenue
amounts to, and what you can afford in
donations and what you can’t. She also
knows that to pass you by, out of pity and
sympathy, would cut you deeper and leave
more on your mind than waking up in the
morning and finding one of your cows had
turned up her heels. So, producing the list
which is flowing over with names and looks
like a diagram of wireless waves, she’ll tell
you they only expect a small contribution
“as you’re a single man, Dickie.” But when
you’re married and have a lot of children to
send along to eat their share of the cakes
and sandwiches, you’ll be expected to donate
a lot more. And though she’ll beam first on
Josie while she's saying all this, and then on
you, a queer feeling that will come over you
—an intuition will keep you from looking at
Josie, and Josie from looking at you. But
it’s the first time you’ve been asked for a
subscription, and it comes on you as a
firstborn, and so your heart will open to it
like a door. But it’s Josie’s job to record
tbs donations, so while she taps her pink
lips with the head of a silver-mounted pencil,
she’ll be looking down with her brown eyes,
waiting for you to name the amount. That
will be a trying moment. You’ll be over-
whelmed with a spirit of big heartedness;
figures will fly to your brain as if you were a
bank; your eyes will dance and glisten as
though you’re enjoying a new sensation;
your shadow will be neglected again, and at
last you’ll blurt out: “Make it a quid.”
“Oh, Dickie Gall!” Mrs. Lee will laugh,
blushing crimson for your dog-gone reckless-
ness. And Josie when she gets her breath,
will gasp “Mister Gall!”
“That’s all right,” you’ll endorse with a
grin—“it doesn’t often happen.”
But, like a mother to you, Mrs. Lee will
tell Josie to put down two shillings, reckon-
ing it’s quite enough, and more than some
who’ll be sending along a cart-load of young-
sters are giving.
“Quite enough, Mr. Gall,” Josie will con-
firm, and her voice will sound as music to
you.
“All right, if y’ think so,” you’ll chuckle
agreeably—“an’ if you wait awhile I’ll go
in an’ get it for y’.”
“You’ll be in the act of turning right
round again to go off into your castle, when
the shadow will once more catch your eye.
Laws! What a predicament you’ll be in
then! Tluy’ll notice your hesitation, and
the fresh color that’s rushed to your cheeks.
But they’ll think it occurred to you that
your treasury is empty, and so Mrs. Leo, to
help you out, will tell you “not to mind —it
doesn’t matter; it’ll do anytime.” But you
don’t want to let them think you haven’t got
any money, so you’ll get a sublime idea, and,
waving your hand to a big gum swaying on
the other side of them, you’ll observe that
it isn’t often four native bears can be seen
up one tree. And while they’re looking
round, laughing, and trying to locate the
fourth bear, you’ll be taking three long fox-
trot steps backwards, telling them at the
same time -where the fourth one is perched,
till suddenly you turn and bound on to the
verandah like a hunted wallaby.
Though you fancy you managed it all
right, the ladies will turn their heads just
in time to see your shirt tail wagging as
you disappear into your castle!
Next minute you’ll be sitting on the
corner of the table, holding your heart and
your breath, and sighing “Oh hell!” But,
of course, you won’t see the pathetic smile
they’ll give each other, or hear Mrs. Lee
whisper: “Th’ poor fellow!” They’ll be real
understanding women, acting to others _as
they would others act to them. But having
got your breath back, and feeling safe inside,
you’ll be breaking your neck screwing and
twisting to find out the total damage done
to your pants. Holy! You would never
have believed it! They are nearly split in
halves! And thanking the Lord, in your
delusion, that the women didn’t see them,
you’ll get out of those pants as though they
were infested with bull-ants, and pull on
others in great haste.
Putting your hand on a couple of bob, out
you’ll go again, smiling confidently and look-
ing a different chap, as you slouch forward
to the sulky, asking if they have seen the
fourth bear yet. And out of the corner of
her eye Mrs. Lee will notice your lightning
change, and that you rubbed them on the
floor before putting them on, thinking to
make them look like a pair you discarded.
But you won’t be aware of what she’s
noticed; so you’ll go on reckoning that women
are as simple as most people think.
When they’re ready to go, and are shaking
hands with you, and you’re blushing up
again, you’ll promise faithfully to go to the
picnic, and to go early, so as to help put
tij> the swings, and collect the wood for
tailing the tea-buckets. Then you’ll open
tl>e gate for them, and stand ready to wave
they look back. But you won’t have
to wave.
Still, when you turn away to go off to
Old Tim and Young Bob again, you’ll be
uplifted, and you’ll grin broadly, and feel
like a martyred hero rising out of his own
ashes.
STEELE RUDD.
The Dandy’s Nugget.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
IT was a hot, steamy night. Two of the
three men had grumbled about the heat
in the intervals of discussing the business
that had brought them together. Dead
Finish is hot in September, and the office of
the Bank of New Holland was not built for
comfort. No bank troubled about comfort
in North Queensland in the early days,
especially in a new goldfield town.
Even the Dandy felt the heat; but the
Dandy never grumbled. Amos Sherwin was
clothed in the usual moleskin trousers and
Crimean shirt of the North Queensland miner
in the ’seventies; and the third man, Ser-
geant Rody Barton, was in his loose uni-
form. The Dandy, however, woi-e the stiff
white shirt, crossed by a crimson cummer-
bund, and the immaculately cut suit he
always affected. Probably he was the only
man in North Queensland who did dress in
that way, at any rate in working hours
The Dandy’s taste in dress had made him
known far and wide. It would have exposed
him to general ridicule but for his popu
larity with the diggers and his skill with his
fists. The last he had demonstrated only
once, and that was in a quarrel with Yankee
Nat, the keeper of the local pub; but it
had been done in such a convincing fashion
that no one had insisted on a repetition
The diggers’ liking for him had led to painful
scenes with many a newcomer who had
sneered at the “silvertail’s” dress, only to
find some brawny “copper nob” shaking a fist
under his nose and inviting him to “put his
blanky hands up.” Caste lines and social
divisions did not apply to the Dandy.
The wooden shutters which took the place
of windows were closed. On the table be-
tween the three men lay something that
almost made them forget the heat. A dull
yellowish-brown mass, the biggest nugget
ever found in Queensland, one of the biggest
ever found in Australia! They gave it a
better sounding name later, but old miners
who never heard of the “Pride of Queens
land” will still tell you a dozen yarns about
the “Dandy’s Nugget.”
Amos Sherwin, the discoverer, a short,
fat little fellow, stroked his little red beard,
and eyed it almost wfith fear. He had done
with it, thank Heaven! He had not the
responsibility of taking it over the hundred
miles of rough country that lay between
Dead Finish and Charlestown, the port of the
goldfield. Somewhere in that hundred miles
the coach was always liable to be stopped.
Ben Morony, the bushranger, before his
identity was discovered, had been a friend
of Yankee Nat’s. Many believed that he still
was, and that when Nat heard of suitable
prey he passed the word on to Ben. The
“bush telegraph” was in good working order
at Dead Finish. In town one often saw
two or three young fellows who seldom did
any work. Yet they were well dressed in a
flash fashion, had money to spend and were
always well mounted. And when Nat. had
any need to communicate, one of the "tele-
graphs” might have been observed taking a
ride into the bush.
Amos knew there was no keeping such a
secret. Everyone knew he had found some-
thing big, and when he left the bank he
would have to face the questions of Yankee
Nat, The Dandy, too, was worried, though
no one watching him would have thought he
was concerned about anything but his
clothes.
“That’s finished,” said Sherwin, “as far
as I’m concerned, and it’s a lot easier to
take a bank draft to Charlestown than it
would be to take the nugget.”
“Just so,” said the Dandy. “Perhaps it
would be easier to take two nuggets than
one. It might puzzle Mr. Morony a bit.”
“What do you mean?” said the sergeant.
“I used to be a bit of an amateur model-
ler,” said the Dandy. “It struck me I might
make an imitation of the nugget—one good
enough to pass a hurried examination, any-
how. This is bound to leak out, and
then the coach will be stopped. If we
sent the imitation by coach. Barton, I might
follow in the buggy afterwards and get
through while Morony was pushing off with
the spoil.”
“Not a bad idea,” said the sergeant—“we
might try it.”
Sherwin left them then, and the Dandy,
watching through a chink in the shutters
his progress along the street, noticed that he
was soon joined by Yankee Nat.
The next day was a busy one for the
Dandy, the local storekeeper’s stock of lead
was purchased, melted and moulded into
the shape of the nugget, and with the aid of
a little paint quite a passable imitation was
produced. It met with the sergeant’s hearty
approval.
Next day the coach set out taking with it
one of the stout wooden boxes which the
bank used when remitting coin or bullion.
One of the bush telegraphs duly wit-
nessed its departure and then rode leisurely
out of town; and patrons of the Miners’
Arms noticed that Yankee Nat was in a
more genial mood than he had been for
months.
Half an hour after the coach’s depar-
ture the Dandy left in his buggy, for, as he
was careful to tell several people, a couple
of days’ visit to Charlestown.
A few miles from town the road ran
between some high rocks, and turning the
corner of one of these the Dandy had just
time to pull up his buggy to avoid driving
into a tree which had fallen across the road.
He was getting down to see if he could
remove the obstruction, when
“Hands up !”
“Rotten luck, sir,” sympathised the dis-
consolate sergeant when the Dandy had
followed his unharnessed horse back to
town. “You stuck up and the coach let
through without being touched! I’ll swear
Sherwin gave the show away, but I can’t
prove a thing. If only we had just kept it
to our two selves everything would have
been right—the plan was good.”
“Not bad,” said the Dandy, anxiously
regarding the thick layer of dust on his once
beautifully-polished boots. “But I thought
of a slight improvement. I guessed Sherwin
was a bad man to keep a secret, so I sent
the real nugget by the coach that got through
this morning.”
