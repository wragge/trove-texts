ASK GRACE BROS
How
do you move
an Embassy
to Buenos Aires?
Because they've done it. Only Grace Bros. Removals are
qualified to move an Embassy “across the world." And not
just because they're big either. But because they care—
care for big things and care about small things.
This job required extra-special care, because all the furnish-
ings were brand new. And the packing cases required special
design—able to withstand salt air and at least five different
loading operations! Care comes from planning. By the way,
Grace Bros, not only moved this furniture —they supplied it,
too! Right down to the light switches —and all they had for
reference were a set of architect's blueprints and some
pictures. Now that's an example of what Grace Bros, have
done. If you have a removals
problem—make the easy deci-
sion (and make the right one).
Call Grace Bros. Removals.

HOW
BIG
IS
When talking of industry, there can be no question about it the Railways of Australia are outstandingly
the biggest. Collectively, they represent a capital investment of £902 million. As the nation’s biggest
employer, they directly give employment to 126,000 men and women; indirectly, they give employment to
scores of thousands more from those who build their locomotives to those who supply carpets for the
floors of their air-conditioned trains.
HOW big is biggost? The Railways of Australia operate 2,763 locomotives, 7,500 passenger vehicles and
90,000 goods wagons over 25,000 route miles; have a turnover of £238 million; pay out nearly £165
million in salaries and wages; buy goods and materials to the value of £64 million.
Last year, the trains of the Railways of Australia ran 96 million miles (a distance to beyond the sun),
carried 465 million passengers and moved 65 million tons of freight in a never-ending collection and
distribution of the nation’s wealth. Railway support means more jobs for more Australians to work towards
the ideal of a more progressive, more prosperous Australia.

How many people know as they use thousands of tons of
Australian-made paper In stationery, books, magazines
and printed brochures that behind this highly organised
regular supply lies an unusual story of progress.
Thirty years ago, all our fine paper was imported because
pulp for this paper came from long-fibred wood, of which
Australia had little. Despite those who said it could not
be done, pulp for fine paper was made here from our own
short-fibred eucalypt trees and a great new industry,
Associated Pulp and Paper Mills Limited, was born.
From idea to idea, process to process, quality to quality,
right through to catering for most of Australia's needs
in fine paper, the company's large mill at Burnie, Tasmania,
has never stopped developing its resources and its
products. This saves us millions of pounds in overseas
exchange every year.
And the long and short of Australia’s growth, too, is the
ability to stand on our own feet and develop our own ideas.

GNOME- the engine
that’s making hovering history
Powers five types of helicopter
Ordered in quantity for hovercraft
Ordered for service in thirteen countries
THE BEST THING that ever happened to
helicopters was the introduction of the gas
turbine.
Overnight, helicopter horizons literally ex-
panded, lifting-power soared, and manoeuvr-
ability increased dramatically.
In Europe, the real break-
through came with the installa-
tion of a Bristol Siddeiej- Gnome engine in the
Westland Whirlwind and Italian Agusta Bell
204 B helicopters.
Next, twin and triple Gnomes were ordered
for large new British, Italian and US helicop-

Agusta 101 G and the Boeing
Vertol 107.

AT THE SECOND SUMMER SCHOOL
in Journalism at Canberra several speak-
ers with great seriousness stressed the
need to dig Australian journalists out of
their comfortable billets in Fleet Street
and set them up in Asian capitals where
Australian newspapers are often not
Represented at all. The speakers found a
father unexpected supporter in the direc-
tor of British Information Services, Mr
A. Hall, who apparently wishes some of
the Australian newspaper colony in Lon-
don further. As things are at the moment,
tie sighed, “if the British Government
were to legalise prostitution in Bourne-
mouth tomorrow you could expect the
Sydney papers to have personally inter-
viewed every prostitute within 24 hours.”
High finance in low places
OUR FINANCE EDITOR has found a
colorful answer to the mystery of how
Communist China has been able to buy
so much gold recently. The Chinese
bought 100 tons (as much as Russia) in
London last year and already this year
have bought 15 tons. Some of the funds
used were sterling and Swiss francs, but,
according to the London “Economist”,
there may have been more exotic sources.
One suggestion is that the purchases have
been made possible by cashing in US
dollars acquired in Vietnam. In Saigon,
prostitution is said to be almost wholly
controlled by the Vietcong. The girls are
paid in dollars, the money goes to the
Vietcong, who buy Chinese aid. The
Chinese convert dollars to sterling in
Hong Kong and then buy gold from the
Bank of England. “Oh,” as a British
play-title said, “what a lovely war!”
Sex and the busy housewife
WE READ in “The Australian” that a
Banish couple, Sten and Inga Hegler,
whose book, “The ABC of Love”, has
been banned in this country, have now
made a long-playing record, entitled
2 x Sex”. This, according to Danish
journalist, Bjorn Westergaard, at present
m Australia, is “Designed to give advice

Suburbia
THE BULLETIN music critic David
Salter this year will add a string to his
bow by becoming editor of Sydney
University students’ paper, “Honi Soit”.
However, he expects some difficulty in
finding enough people among the 16,000-
odd students at Australia’s oldest and
largest university interested in helping
him. Sydney University these days seems
remarkable only for lassitude, particularly
in extra-curricular activity. In drama,
SUDS limps along on a deficit and
Players has given up the struggle, and
there still seems to be a desperate hope
that if the Powers art bequest can be
ignored long enough it will quietly go
away. “Sydney University is now a vast,
comfortable suburb,” Salter says. “People
creep in through the gates, thinking,
peace at last. They eat their sandwiches
in the Union, trot off to lectures and don’t
want anything or anyone to disturb
them.”
Trials of a judge
LAST WEEK, for the first time in
years, NSW Supreme Court judges did
not walk in procession to Sydney churches
for services to open the law term but
scurried in side doors. This was because
the Court of Appeal of seven judges, set
up under new legislation by the NSW
Government, has turned the table of
precedence topsy-turvy. This break with
tradition may be only a fairly simple
instance of human vanity, but, after all,
the Bench is there to administer and up-
hold the law. In this instance, the judges
may not be showing contempt for the
law, but they at least have shown a cer-
tain irritation with it when it ruffles their
sense of self-importance.
"Excuse me, Jack, but are you SURE
you're all right?"

REPORTS coming out of Hobart from
the National Union of Australian Uni-
versity Students’ conference have struck
alarm in mainland academic breasts. Uni-
versity lecturers, Melbourne first, are to
have their teaching abilities surveyed and
rated by student organisations. At the
moment it is hard to see how serious the
students are about this. At some Ameri-
can universities the rating of academics,
linked with frank comment on a lecturer’s
methods and capabilities, is a highly
organised and influential aspect of uni-
versity life. Student leaders here who
believe academics do not get enough
training in education and then become
more concerned with scrambling up the
salary scale than with teaching, think
the ratings system might have some
effect. In any case, it should be interest-
ing to see who’s in the top 20 on the
popularity charts.

THIS AUSTRALIA
VIETNAM
Humphrey’s High-powered Team
In his inimitable bustling manner, President Johnson capped off his Honolulu
talks by sending off a collection of his top men on a quick tour of Allied capitals
in the Pacific, Canberra included.
First it was Tuesday, then Wednesday
and finally, or almost finally, it looked
as though US Vice-President Humphrey
and his team would be in Canberra this
Sunday after their tour of Asia. On
their way with Humphrey are Mr
Averell Harriman, Ambassador-at-large,
Mr McGeorge Bundy, Special Assistant
for National Security Affairs, Mr Walt
Whitman Rostow, Head of the State
Department's Planning Council and Mr
Jack Valenti, President Johnson’s
“Special Assistant”.
People both in the American Embassy
in Canberra and in the Department of
External Affairs were initially a little
taken aback by the -.suddenness with
which some of the main personalities
were about to be thrust on them. “This
is perhaps the most high-powered Ame-
rican team ever to come to Australia,”
said an embassy man last Friday, “and
we don’t know when they will arrive or
what their exact mission is.” External
Affairs was struggling to find out whether
there was any more to Honolulu than
the official statements explicitly said,
awaiting cables from embassies in Wash-
ington and Saigon. But the general
view that soon emerged was that, des-
pite the excited flurry of events, there
was not much profit in searching specu-
lation. President Johnson’s motives were
straightforward.
He wanted to give new impetus to
the non-military aspects of the struggle
against the Communists, giving meaning
to his State of the Union promise to
“continue to help the people of South
Vietnam care for those ravaged by battle,
create progress in the villages, and carry
forward the healing hopes of peace as
best they can amidst the uncertain ter-
rors of war”.
The fact is, of course, that the Ame-
rican administration has for long re-
cognized the importance of economic
improvement and aid for development
has been flowing into South Vietnam
in increasing quantities since it began
back in 1955. Just over a fortnight ago
in his special message to Congress Pre-
sident Johnson requested $2468 million
for economic aid in the 1967 fiscal year,
of which by far the largest appropriation
-—ssso million—was for South Vietnam.
By the dramatic act of flying halfway
across the Pacific, accompanied by his
advisers on the Agriculture, Health and
Education programmes of his domestic
“great society”, he hoped to impress on
the South Vietnamese and on members
of his administration, and the rest of
the world, his interest in economic and
social improvement for South Vietnam
alongside the defensive war. Having
for the time at least rejected the advice
both of the South Vietnamese and of
his own military to hit North Vietnam
harder by extending the list of bombing
targets, blockading shipping and cutting
the infiltration routes through Laos,
President Johnson may have thought it
an appropriate time to reassure the Viet-
namese leaders personally that America
would “not be defeated,.not grow tired,
not withdraw either openly or under the
cloak of a meaningless agreement”.
Canberra observers also believe that
President Johnson attempted to reconcile
the two points of difference between
the South Vietnamese and American
positions: first General Ky’s rejection
of any recognition of the Vietcong even
as part of a North Vietnam negotiating
team, and second his “hawkish” demands
for a tougher military campaign against
the North. They believe that the dif-
ferences are mainly significant for the
propaganda potential they contain for
opponents of US policies, and Johnson is
intent on persuading the South Vietnam-
ese not to say anything which might be
used to throw doubts on the proposition
that the sole responsibility for the con-
tinuation of the war lies with Hanoi.
In Perth last week, Mr Hasluck was
advised by his department that the
Humphrey team was coming for the sole
purpose of informing the Australian
Government of the outcome of the
Honolulu talks and sounding out our
views on the programme of helping Viet-
nam, in both its military and non-milit-
ary aspects. It is considered unlikely
that at a meeting of this sort any major
request for increased Australian partici-
pation would be made, though the team
would be reporting back to the President
the general attitude here.
Specific requests are generally transmit-
ted through embassies after a variety
of tentative feelers. It is also being said
that the Americans welcome the oppor-
tunity of meeting Mr Holt and members
of the Cabinet, especially those in new
capacities.
Who are the members of the team
President Johnson has sent? George
McGann reports from New York:
“HThe President had two pieces of
■*" advice for me on my new job,” Vice.
President Hubert Humphrey told a
Washington audience after the Demo-
cratic victory in the 1964 elections.
“ ‘First,’ he said, ‘keep your eyes open
"i . ”He paused as friendly laughter
erupted. Humphrey, whose talkativeness
is legendary, had no need to finish the
sentence.
Since then, by design or not, Hubert
Horatio Humphrey has had precious
little opportunity to open his mouth, in
public at any rate. His political image
and more important his veil-known
presidential ambitions have been sub-
merged under the enormous weight of
the man from Texas, President Lyndon
Johnson. So much so that popular
opinion polls late last year showed
Humphrey “running” far behind glamor-
boy Bobby Kennedy, his arch-rival for
the Democratic nomination to succeed
LBJ in the White House.
The President’s failure to send the
Vice-President to Winston Churchill’s
funeral as his personal representative
(Chief Justice Earl Warren fulfilled that
assignment) was widely interpreted as a
deliberate downgrading of the Vice-
President’s role by a President who,
ironically, had suffered severely in that
post as the shadow of President John F.
Kennedy.
But in recent months the President
appears to have been using his Vice-
President in the vital role of foreign
representative extraordinary with the
mission to explain administration poli-
cies, gather information and radiate
goodwill. In all capacities the bouncy,
ebullient “veep” has been doing remark-
ably well, in the opinion of America’s
professional diplomats. Wherever he has
travelled to New Delhi, to Tokyo, to
Manila, to Taipei and Seoul he has
been so successful in spreading the gos-
pel of “the great society” that American
ambassadors abroad have regretted the
brevity of the Humphrey visits. “If they
had any complaint,” the “New York
Times” noted, “it was that Mr Hum-
phrey could not stay longer and deliver
his message in less diplomatic language
with some of his vaunted stump f er '
vor, to university, journalistic and trades-
union audiences.”
It was among these groups that credi-
bility of administration statements had
been lowest. And it was precisely among
these groups that the Vice-President mads
the deepest impression because of his
well-known liberal stance on behalf ot


civil rights, a nuclear test ban, food-for-
peace and the Peace Corps.
His current mission to major cities
around the Pacific perimeter has added
to the Vice-President’s stature, both
abroad and at home. He was honored
by the most impressive salute given any
foreign visitor in recent years in Saigon
a «<i it, no doubt, set the tone for the re-
ception he will get everywhere he goes.

Whenever one of the last five US
residents Roosevelt, Truman, Eisen-
bower, Kennedy, Johnson wanted to
ta lk seriously to the Russians they called
on a tall, lean, extremely wealthy aristo-
crat named William Averell Harriman
as their spokesman. Harriman has held
a variety of portfolios, ranging from war-
11116 ambassador to Moscow to his
present role as roving ambassador for
President Johnson. Former Soviet leader
Khrushchev once summed up the Red
view of Harriman: ‘He is a responsible
man ” Harriman says of Russia: “I have
a certain feeling for the place and what
S °e s on there.”
At 75, Harriman has the energy and
optimism of a man half his age as he
travels the world in the role of US
trouble-shooter extraordinary. He wants
youthful people around him. “People
have to be given big jobs when they are
young or else their minds become per-
manently closed,” he maintains. Oddly
enough, when Harriman was young his
interests were not the family enterprise,
the Union Pacific Railroad (of which he
had been elected a director while still at
Yale University), tiut polo, tournament
bridge and horse-racing. He matured
later in life but has stayed the course.
A Right-wing Republican by birth and
training, Harriman developed into a New
Deal Democrat under his friend and
fellow-apostate Franklin Roosevelt. He
got interested in local New York State
politics early in the depression years and
eventually became Governor of the State,
But his real interests lay in foreign affairs,
particularly those concerning the Soviet
Union. Perhaps his greatest achievement
in dealing with the Russians was his
success in negotiating a nuclear test-ban
treaty when most people thought it
couldn’t be done. How had he accom-
plished this? “When dealing with the
Russians I always stick to the facts.”

McGeorge Bundy, known as the “non-
Tanner
"Now, say after me, 'Ah, wilderness is paradise enow'."


duplicatable man” in the White House,
will have to be replaced, if not
duplicated. After more than “two thous-
and days” of devoted service to two
Presidents in the critical job of Special
Assistant for National Security Affairs,
Bundy has resigned. The former Harvard
professor will take over the presidency
of the Ford Foundation (at a rise in
salary from 28,000 dollars to 75,000
yearly) on March 1. His current Pacific
journey with Vice-President Humphrey
is probably the last major contribution he
will make to governmental policy as a
member of the administration.
Not the least remarkable of Bundy’s
accomplishments was his unexpected
decision to remain in the Johnson
administration after the death of a man
to whom he was so closely allied in the
Boston - Harvard - intellectual tradition.
Bundy, a Boston Brahmin of impeccable
family background, with myriad ties to
prominent academicians and statesmen,
was a “Kennedy man” in a very special
way. “He understood the President’s
thinking as well as anyone and he knew
what the President needed and wanted in
order to make up his mind,” Bobby
Kennedy recently recalled.
Bundy and his staff formed under
Kennedy a kind of “junior state depart-
ment” and were credited with at least
80 per cent of the initiatives ideas
and methods for such important issues
as the test-ban treaty. Under Johnson
the Bundy office was never so influen-
tial. However, Johnson consulted Bundy
daily (86 times during the first few days
of the Dominican crisis) and relied on
his judgment on matters touching
defence, intelligence and confrontation
with the Communist countries. Bundy
also gained for Johnson some confidence
among intellectuals outside the Govern-
ment and foreign policy professionals
within it that he might not otherwise
have received. Bundy, who served two
Democratic Presidents, is a Republican.

The assassination of President
Kennedy touched the lives of many
people. It completely changed the course
of Jack Valenti’s. The modest, intelligent
42-year-old advertising man was in Dallas
organising a testimonial dinner scheduled
for the night of November 22, 1963, at
which Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson
were to appear. Valenti, Texas-born son
of Italian immigrants, had done many
important political chores for Lyndon
Johnson over the years and had married
his private secretary, Mary Wiley. When
Kennedy died in Parkland Hospital,
Johnson instructed Valenti to accom-
pany him to Dallas airport. Valenti wit-
nessed Johnson taking the oath of office
in the Presidential plane and flew with
him to Washington. He has been at the
President’s side, almost literally night
and day, ever since that fateful day, in
his role of “Special Consultant”, which
encompasses a vast and varied range of
duties. Valenti is a talented writer who
contributes much to the Presidential
speeches.
Valenti is the first of the President’s
battery of personal aides to see Johnson
each morning and usually is the one who
bids him goodnight. Valenti rises at 5.30
to be in the President’s White House
bedroom at 6.30 to share his breakfast
of tea and melon. The President and
Valenti go jver in detail the day’s
schedule. Johnson lists what he wants
to accomplish, the things that must be
written and those that Valenti will need
to follow through.
Valenti’s office is immediately next to
the oval room, where the President
works. He puts in an 18-hour day with
his boss and, like him, gets along on
about six hours’ sleep. Valenti makes no
claims to being a policy-maker, despite
his close relationship with the Presi-
dent. His job, as he puts it, is simply
“to help Mr Johnson and make his task
easier”. Valenti is occasionally given a
special assignment outside the White
House, such as accompanying Vice-Presi-
dent Humphrey abroad as his speech
writer.

Economics Professor at Harvard, Rostow
first gained international attention in a
series of lectures at Cambridge University
in 1958 which constituted a kind of “non.
Communist manifesto”. They impressed
the “London Economist” but annoyed
Moscow and outraged orthodox econo
mists in the United States.
Rostow theorised that all nations were
in one of five stages of development
traditional or primitive; transitional
having the pre-conditions for economic
growth; take-off, in which growth
generates momentum; drive to maturity
in which a growing economy expands'
modern technology over the entire
economic front; age of high mass-con-
sumption. Rostow suggested that the
US had reached stage five in the 1920 s
and that Russia was still in stage four
but about to reach the final stage,
“Pravda” was incensed by Rostow’s
theory since it ignored the class struggle.
Capitalistic economists complained that
it denied the sanctity of free enterprise,
As a key policy-making member of
both the Kennedy and Johnson admini-
strations, 50-year-old Rostow has con- j
tinued to annoy both radicals and con-
servatives, particularly in his appearances
in various world capitals arguing
strenuously on behalf of the American
position in Vietnam. His predecessor in
the post of planning chief at the State
Department, Louis Halle, once called
Rostow “an activist who believes that the
challenge to our society calls for innova-
tion and sacrifice at the service of a
dynamic purpose”. Rostow refuses to
take himself that seriously. “I don’t pose
as a philosopher,” he told a reporter
when he first arrived in Washington. “I
am just a working stiff.”
THE ALP
Too Much Nose-rubbing?
The Left wing has tightened its grip ruthlessly possibly too ruthlessly upon
the throat of the Labor Party. At last week’s meeting of the Federal Executive the
Left wing took over complete charge of foreign affairs. It took over education,
Formally and officially it reduced Labor parliamentarians to the status of office-boys.
Whether the Left wing has gone too
far remains to be seen. So far two Labor
parliamentarians—Gough Whitlam, the
Federal deputy leader, and Allan
Fraser, Labor MFIR for Eden-Monaro —
have come out openly in defiance.
Whitlam has refused to sit on the legal
committee to which the ALP Federal
Executive has referred the West Aus-
tralian motion backed by Mr F. E.
Chamberlain the WA ALP secretary-
for legal examination of the constitution-
ality of State Aid. Fraser has given very
clear indications that he is not going
to be bulldozed by the Executive even
if it costs him his political existence.
From here on it is a war of nerves.
Both Whitlam and Fraser know that they
have the backing of the ALP rank-and-
filer at the grass-roots level. If a grass-
roots revolution starts, Chamberlain and
his backers, like the Victorian ALP
Executive (which is an Executive without
a rank-and-file backing), will have had
their chips. But Chamberlain controls
the ALP machine, and usually the
machine can prevail, if those who have
control of the machine have strong, cool
nerves,
. , . . . ,
And Chamberlain has strong, cod
nerves ; After last week s Executive meet-
in 2’ which left behind it a trail o wre
a § e a tornado, Chamberlain wa
poised, smiling happily. He had not only
won. But in winning he had rubbed > s
opponents’ noses the noses of the
parliamentarians against whom he seems
to nurse a cherished grievance (he has
never himself been able to win a p re ‘


selection in the ALP for a parliamentary
position) —in the mud.
Fraser and the overwhelming majority
of Caucus had by inference backed State
Aid? Okay. They would be shown where
to get out. Chamberlain, the most
vociferous opponent of State Aid, had
himself made the chairman of the
Education Committee.
The Caucus did not like some of the
Left wing’s foreign policy lines? The
Labor parliamentarians would not put
on their Foreign Affairs committee Mr
Tom Uren and others whose viewpoint
was closer to the Left-wing ALP machine
controllers? Who cares? The Left-wing
ALP machine controllers, having demon-
strated that their committees and their
machine operations were superior to the
i Labor Parliamentary Party, proceeded to
put their own nominees on their own
committee. Senators Cavanagh (SA),
Senator Cohen (Vic.) and Senator
Wheeldon (WA), a Chamberlain protege
and a recent newcomer to the Parliament,
were put on in place of Fraser, the SA
Attorney-General Don Dunstan and the
former Victorian ALP President Mr R.
Holt Holt had crossed the Left-wingers
by drawing attention to the condoning by
the Left-wing Victorian ALP Executive
of breaches of Federal rules outlawing
unity tickets between ALP members
and Communists in union elections. With
Dr J. Cairns also put on the ALP
Foreign Affairs and Defence Committee,
they would he able to swamp Mr C. T.
Oliver, the NSW ALP President, and
Senator A. Mulvihill, the only Right-
wingers allowed to survive.
Some of the parliamentarians think
that the Party has the death wish that
it desires to destroy itself electorally.
Personally I think it goes much deeper
than this. If you look at what has been
happening in the Senate you get a clue
to the Left-wing thinking. Quite a num-
ber of Left-wingers cannot win House of
Representatives seats. They would find it
hard to do so on their political records.
So the Left wing gets them put on ALP-
Senate tickets where the personalities do
not matter.
But the Left wing has not been able to
<jo the same in the House of Representa-
tives. Consequently, the Left wing has
sever been able to control the Federal
Labor Caucus. But if you cut down
Labor’s electoral support to the mini-
iuum (which seems to have been what
the Left-wing-dominated ALP Executive
Se t out to do last week) only Labor Mem-
bers in dyed-in-the-wool Labor seats
I S'ould survive. The Left wing controls
the pre-selection in these seats in several
States outside NSW and, particularly,
111 Queensland. They would have a
smaller Parliamentary Labor Party but
't Would be a Parliamentary Labor
ptty which would consist of a hard,
core of Leftists prepared and willing
to take instructions from the ALP
Executive irrespective of what those in-
structions might be.
Then, on this line of thinking, you
have only to bide your time. Sooner or
later the present non-Labor Government
will disintegrate. You represent the only
alternative Government. You will be
sucked willy-nilly, and with parliamen-
tarians you nominate and can control,
into the power vacuum.
Actually it is good, clear, long-range
thinking. There is only one flaw in it.
You have to presuppose that your oppon-
ents within the Labor Party do not fight
back and your extremism does not
create the situation in which they could
fight back successfully. You also have
to presuppose that as you contract your
power area as an Opposition political
party some other party force does not
rise to fill the area you vacate.
With Whitlam and Fraser both clearly
restive, both situations are possible.
Whitlam and/or Fraser may now have
been placed in a situation that they can
fight back. And if Labor continues on
its present course there is also reason to
believe that it could lose its present
status as a major political party and
become a rump representing nothing
but a Leftist-aligned group.

TRADE UNIONS
The 48-hour Lesson
When the Trades Hall Council called off its proposed strike at Christmas, Sir
Henry Bolte taunted THC officials with the charge that they were “not game to
strike”. He now knows differently.
Last Wednesday, 80,000 State Govern-
ment workers were called out, and for
48 hours no trains, trams or Government
buses ran, lighting and heating were
severely restricted, no power was avail-
able for any industrial, commercial, or
domestic electric motors or motor-
driven equipment, nor for theatres, places
of entertainment or public halls (Sir
Robert Menzies was forced to announce
his retirement to the Kooyong electorate
committee by candlelight).
Altogether it cost the State about £5
million in wages lost by the strikers,
the tens of thousands of other workers
who were stood down because of power
restrictions, and in production losses,
to prove that the union movement was
“game”. And it threatens to become
“gamer” still. A four-day strike is now
being discussed by Trades Hall officials.
The unions are demanding four weeks’
annual leave for all workers in State
Government offices and instrumentalities.
They have enjoyed three weeks’ holiday
for the past 18 years and, until 1963,
this was a week more than workers had
in private industry. Since the Arbitra-
tion Commission made three weeks’
holiday general throughout Australia,
there has been increasing union agitation
for State Government workers to regain
their privilege of a week extra.
The State Government has replied to
union demands declaring that while it is
aware that historically there ha; been “a
leisure differential” between Government
and private employees it can find no
social or economic reasons why this
should continue.
The Secretary of the Trades Hall
Council, Mr Mick Jordan, claims that
the council is carrying out Trades Hall
policy and that there are three reasons
for granting Government workers more
leave: 1. They provide services essential
to the public: 2 They sometimes work
irregular shifts 3. They are sometimes
required to work on weekends and
public holidays
Put at its best the unions’ case is not
strong, and certainly not much appreci-
ated by workers in private industry. Why,
then, the drastic action of a State-para-
b'sing stoppage?
The answer lies in the nature of
Trades Hall politics, and in the jaunty,
sparring style of Premiership adopted by
Sir Henry Bolte. The Melbourne Trades
Hall is at present controlled by an anti-
Comniunist ALP group under the
leadership of Mick Jordan, a man of
great bulk and ability. The Jordan
group is tough and and pre-
fers negotiations to strikes.
The THC Disputes Committee, how-
ever, is under Communist Left-wing con-
trol at present because each of the
unions concerned in a dispute sends
two delegates to the Disputes Committee
and the delegates from the Communist
controlled Railways Union, Tramways
Union, Amalgamated Engineering Union,
Boilermakers’ Union and fellow-travellers
from other Left-wing unions, outnum-
ber the moderate majority of the 11
permanent Disputes Committee mem-
bers.
The militants are thus able to call a
strike whether the Trades Hall executive
agrees or not, and at the moment they
are anxious to call strikes because the
Australian Communist Party is anxious
to create a maximum of industrial unrest
for political reasons. Basically, the party
wants to keep itself in full training in
case events in Asia create some kind of
national emergency, and the chance
arises to cripple the country and estab-
lish a united-front, Leftist government.
The feeling around moderate circles in
the Trades Hall last week was that it
was unfortunate the strike caused such
inconvenience but Bolte had it com-
ing to him. A prominent DLP unionist
said: “In one way the strike seems a
bit tough, but something has to be done
to teach Bolte a lesson”. The Com-
munists shrewdly used trade union re-
sentment against the Premier.
So far the Premier has replied to the
challenge by giving more cheek:
“I have given my answer to the leave
question and that is final. 1 will see
Mr Jordan and as many colleagues as
he is prepared to bring along three times
a day for the next fortnight But he
will get the same answer.” There is no
hint of compromise in the Premier’s at-
titude and some consideration must be
given to the thought that he may be try-
ing to provoke the unions so that he can
use the powers of the Essential Services
Act.
The Essential Services Act was passed
during the strike-pitted months of
1948 but has never been proclaimed.
Mr Bolte became alarmed a while back
when he discovered how strong a grip
the Communist Party had on the State’s
power and transport; he also recently
became aware of the CP’s announced
intention to step up the pace of industrial
unrest. A possible explanation for his
behavior is that he wants the unions
so to alienate public opinion that he
can bring the Act into force. There is
certainly no doubt that the strike had
little public support; it is most im-
probable that it would have survived a
secret ballot by the unionists concerned.
The fact is that workers are now much
more concerned about increasing their
pay than about an extra week’s holiday.
Other Government workers have com-
plained that their holidays are not so
attractive because they lose overtime
and other fringe benefits and drop to
the base pay rate. The worst feature of
the employment of Government workers
is that, especially in the lower ranks,
many of them have few marketable
talents or skills and their alternatives
to Government employment are fre-
quently only factory laboring or low-
skilled process work.
Society punishes them for their lack
of ability or opportunity by paying them
wages on which it is almost impossible
to raise a family in minimal comfort
and security.
If the giants of Lygon Street and
Treasury Place must emerge to clinch
in mortal combat it seems tragic that
they will not brawl about something of
social importance.

No Man in Delhi
“Journalistic colonialism?"
By SAM LIPSKI
In last year’s A. N. Smith Memorial Lecture on Journalism, Sir James Plimsoll,
the Head of External Affairs, emphasised the need for more Australian correspondents
in Asia—especially in those capitals like New Delhi where we are not represented at all.
In two days at the Second Summer
School on Journalism held in Canberra
earlier this month Sir James’ call for
more correspondents in Asia was taken
up and reinforced by the Governor-
General, Lord Casey, and the five
speakers who presented papers to the 135
journalists, academics and newspaper
executives who attended. By the end of
the conference, “More Australian Foreign
Correspondents” had become an article
of faith, if not quite a battle-cry.
Lord Casey’s apt phrase “journalistic
colonialism”, to describe the reliance on
American or British correspondents in
a region which matters vitally to Aus-
tralia, struck home. Officially opening
the school this year devoted to the
topic, “The Australian Press and
Foreign News” Lord Casey spoke of
“a large, growing, and unsatisfied de-
mand for something better and in great-
er depth in the coverage of foreign
affairs”. Only Australians could really
write for Australians and news-agencies
could not make up for the “astonishing
lack” of foreign correspondents in the
field.
Like Lord Casey every speaker re-
turned to this theme again and again.
Professor MacMahon Ball, Professor of
Political Science at Melbourne Univer-
sity, noted that the Australian metropolis
tan Press, which seemed prosperous
enough, was “unable or unwilling” to
maintain more than three or four cor-
respondents in the whole of East and
South-east Asia “where two thirds of
the world's people live and where gov-
ernments and people are very much on
the move.”
The question was not whether news-
papers could afford a better coverage
but whether the community could not
afford it. Should the community, for in-
stance, give newspapers material incen-
tives to spend more on overseas coverage?
If tariffs and export incentives for priv-
ate industry were in the national interest
did not the same apply to newspapers?
There were delicate questions of indep-
endence involved but Professor Ball did
not seem to think them so delicate as to
prevent serious inquiry.
The "Ball proposal” raises other ques-
tions. Just how much does it cost to
maintain correspondents in Asia? What
are the main expenses? At least some
of these questions were tackled in a very
useful paper by Mr J. E. Hoffman, Over-
seas Services Editor of the Melbourne
“Herald”.
An overseas correspondent in Singa-
pore or Djakarta, according to Mr Hoff-
man, cost his newspaper between
$25,000 to $30,000 a year. The same
correspondent in New York or London
would cost the paper $lO,OOO to
$12,000 a year. Cable costs from South
Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, and Thailand
at the Press rate of about 26c a word or
from Japan at about 16c were one of
the reasons why even those correspon-
dents who were sent to Asia were
usually located in Singapore.
But perhaps the most revealing points
in Mr Hoffman's paper were those about
the shifting patterns of reader interest
in overseas news. Five out of the six
highest daily circulation figures for the
Melbourne “Herald” have been for
overseas news; President Kennedy’s
assassination (621,000), the Oswald
shooting (573,000), President Kennedy’s
funeral (535,000), the sacking of Khrush-
chev (534,000) and Russia’s warning
to America on the first bombing of
North Vietnam (531,000). The excep-
tion in the list of the first six, not too
surprisingly, was for the start of the
1964 Melbourne Australian Rules Foot-
ball season (541,000). Some in the
audience were doubtful about what the
figures really meant. Of course, nearly
all of them but significantly not the
Russian warning on Vietnam are for
exceptional world-shattering events. But
isn’t that the point? Might it not be that
readers’ ideas of what are world-shat-
tering events have changed slowly, but
definitely, from the cutting down of a
tree along St Kilda Road to the dangers
of escalation in Vietnam?
Mr Hoffman offered some interesting
supporting evidence for this view. His
paper's sales department now believes
that sensational local stories like murders
“no longer added a single extra copy to
circulation”. But sales did go up when
there were important developments in
Vietnam.
The Melbourne “Age” commissioned
a survey last year which showed that a
big majority of readers wanted more
overseas news, especially interpretative
news. What must have surprised even
the foreign pages’ staunchest advocates,
however, was that the survey also show-
ed that readers were more familiar with
the bylines of the “Age’s” overseas cor-
respondents than with those of the local
sportswriters.
But whom to send? Here again nearly
all the speakers agreed that a rather
special breed of man was needed . ,
first-rate journalist, only more so —.
preferably with a knowledge of languages
and history, local customs and politics
and as someone sagely contributed from
the floor a “constitution like an ox”,
From the paper of Bruce Grant it was
clear that he needed something else as
well a developed sense of his own
personal, and indeed, national identity.
Formerly a correspondent in South-east
Asia and in Washington and now an
academic at Melbourne University, he
gave the most highly personal of the
papers and succeeded in conveying
something of the dilemmas and frustra-
tions as well as the special attractions
of the foreign correspondent.
The Public Information Officer in the
Department of External affairs, Mr R.
Woolcott, took up the question of the
relationship between the Press and
national policy in a paper which pro-
posed an unusual and, to some journalists
present, an unholy “alliance” between
governments and correspondents. There
was a need to strike a sensible balance,
thought Mr Woolcott, between what is
often called “the public’s need to know
and the Government’s right in certain cir-
cumstances not to disclose information”.
Mr Woolcott also thought that this was
now accepted by “most Australian cor-
respondents who deal with these issues”.
Well, is it? How did it come to be
accepted? If it is accepted so widely is
that such a good thing from the public’s
point of view? What sort of journalist
does this “balance” tend to create? Will
the “balanced” journalist ask the uncom-
fortable questions? Mr Woolcott’s re-
marks did lead to a few grumbles about
“managed news” and a reassertion of
the public’s right to know and the
journalist’s duty to tell them —but it was
not perhaps the time or place to probe
deeply.
As to the present coverage of foreign
affairs in the Australian Press, Mr Wooi-
cott was both complimentary and critical.
He found a marked increase in the
amount of space being given to overseas
news although he was less enthusiastic
about the quality of the coverage. He
was especially concerned about some of
the reporting of the war in Vietnam,
citing the furore about the use of so-
called “poison gas” and the preponder-
ance of photographs showing alleged
atrocities by South Vietnamese forces
against Vietcong guerrillas. Although the
Vietcong assassinated more than 1500
civilians and more than 500 local of-
ficials in 1965 “this was not the im*
pression that one received from the Aus-
tralian Press, although I hasten to add

that I do not believe for one moment
that this was a conscious policy”.
While most of the conference was
heavily Asia-centred in its term of refer-
ebce, a paper by Peter Hastings, Execu-
tive Officer of the Council for New
Guinea Affairs, dealt specifically with
“The Australian Press and New Guinea”.
Mr Hastings said that at present there
wa s not “any meaningful continuing
public interest in New Guinea as a vital
fact of Australian life or any compre-
hension of the_profound way in which
New Guinea’s political, social and econo-
mic development is increasingly affecting
the lives of every person in this country”.
The more serious Australian newspapers
had to change this indifference.
Before the Press could deal with these
questions it must itself fully comprehend
the importance of New Guinea as being
essentially newsworthy. Mr Hastings sug-
gested that those who wanted to report
New Guinea had to become specialists
on the country’s historical, social and
economic development—as “we shall
have to become specialists in arbitration,
education, defence and all other aspects
of our national political life”. One or
two journalists echoed this call for
specialisation some were sceptical.
None gave it more forceful expression
than Professor W. Sprague Holden, visit-
ing professor of journalism from Wayne
State University in Michigan, USA.
When he was here 10 years ago, Pro-
fessor Holden’s most disturbing finding,
as reported in his “Australia Goes to
Press”, was the low regard for univer-
sity education he found in the news-
paper industry at all' levels. Back for
another look, he said: “Things must be
much better today”. Well, are they?
Some newspapers, especially in Mel-
bourne, emphasise the value of university
study to their cadets and encourage, with
varying emphasis, Diploma of Journalism
courses. Yet if one compares the efforts
being made to attract the best graduates
to journalism with the efforts being made
by every other branch of private industry,
newspapers are not in the race and do
not seem to care much that they are not.
This is the basic issue to which all the
papers at the Summer School lead back;
tbe quality of the men who will go to
Delhi or Washington, to Tokyo or Mos-
Cow , in the ’sixties and ’seventies for
go they surely must.
What kudos the Summer School will
able to claim for that development
w ben it occurs is, of course, questionable.
For one thing it operated within certain
limitations, some of them imposed by
journalists themselves. For instance Syd-
ney journalists (but not Melbourne
j* nes ) on the whole ignored the School.
. t one leader writer or editorial execu-
te who regularly deals with foreign
news on any of Sydney’s four dailies was
present and with the exception of the
“Daily Telegraph’s” Alan Reid, not one
of their Canberra Heads of Service
attended.
But given these limitations the papers
were generally useful, informed and
often challenging and discussion, although
repetitious and somewhat undirected, did
end up by suggesting some concrete pro-
posals—an approach to the Government
on the high cost of cabling from over-
seas, more briefings from External Af-
fairs, an investigation of the possibilities
of sending journalists to the audio-visual
language school at Point Cook to learn
Asian languages, and an exchange plan
with journalists from South-East Asia,
Above all the School demonstrated
that journalists can generate discussion
and criticism about their own work with
the aim of improving it. Last year’s
Summer School the first was dis-
missed in some quarters, both among
journalists themselves and their era-
ployers, as a passing aberration. Yet it
did have an impact in such areas as cadet
training. Certainly, it will be much
harder to dismiss the movement of ideas
and enthusiasm arising out of this year’s
meeting.

SOUTH AUSTRALIA The Power and the Throne
According to legend there is always a
power behind the throne in Aus-
tralian State politics: Rylah in Vic-
toria, Court in Western Australia, and so
on. (For the past 16 years no one has
dared, of course, to make the same claim
about Federal Government; but in
previous decades rumors proliferated
about Federal grey eminences.)
In South Australia the hidden per-
suader behind the new Labor adminis-
tration is alleged to be Mr Don Dunstan,
Attorney-General and Minister for both
Aboriginal Affairs and Social Welfare.
True to reputation, Dunstan had an
appointment book brimming over the
margins with conferences and official
functions and I had to wait until Satur-
day afternoon to get any time with him.
A typical Adelaide summer afternoon:
hot, dry, breathless; the door of the
Norwood villa was opened with cour-
teous reserve by a man of small frame,
but very trim and well-muscled, clad in
swimming trunks. When I remarked on
his apparent fitness Dunstan assured me
that it was all the product of a gym
course ordered by his doctor: “I used to
look like one of the ‘Before’ pictures
in the ‘Before and After’ ads. in the
men’s magazines.”
Thirty-nine years old, the holder of
three portfolios and also in charge of
town planning, he was spending the after-
noon helping his three children and some
Young Labor people organise a Young
Labor barbecue which was being held
there that night. We took a couple of
cans and glasses out the back and began
talking on the grass tennis court.
In its first two Parliaments the Labor
Government (which came into office in
March, 1965, after 32 years of Op-
position) introduced more than 50 new
Bills, and printed, ready for tabling,
another 50. Most of these Bills are con-
cerned with policy matters and attempt
to effect significant social and economic
changes. Nearly one-third of them have
been introduced by Dunstan: indicative
of a zeal which would have dismayed a
Talleyrand. I asked him how the con-
servative Opposition and the Adelaide
Establishment had reacted to his legis-
lative energy.
“In some quarters, nothing short of
alarm and horror. I was educated at
St Peter’s College before going to
Adelaide University to study law, and
some senior members of the Establish-
ment seem to think that I have betrayed
my class or heritage or something.” He
explained that the Bill which had most
aroused the ire of the southern landed
gentry was the Succession Duties
Amendment Bill which he introduced as
Attorney-General last November.
Under the Playford Liberal-Country
League administration the burden of
death duties fell much more heavily on
those of small means and much more
lightly on the wealthy than in any other
State of the Commonwealth. A number
of loopholes were available to enable
those of ample means to escape from
most of the duties which appeared to be
imposed. The favorite device was a
special kind of insurance policy which
could be used to transfer wealth from
generation to generation without suffer-
ing much diminution from the pruning
DON DUNSTAN
knives of the Probate Office. Estates of
up to £50,000 were sometimes passed on
without any duty being paid at all, and
estates of greater value escaped the
burden of taxation imposed elsewhere.
South Australia earned the fine reputa-
tion of being the best State of the Com-
monwealth to die in.
Under the new Succession Duties
Act, the lower-middle and working-class
groups will pay less and the wealthy will
pay more. The incidence of the duties
will fall in a ratio similar to that operat-
ing in other States. But a furious cam-
paign against the Bill has been mounted
by the Opposition, a number of insurance
companies, and the conservative
Adelaide “Advertiser”.
Dunstan moved his chair a little
further into the sun (“I don’t get much
time for sunbaking these days”) and
reflected an almost boyish grin: “When
the Bill was introduced it met with shrill
screams from the LCL and its news-
paper supporters. They have tried to
represent the Bill as increasing succes-
sion duties on widows inheriting small
estates. To justify this the Leader of the
Opposition invented imaginary cases
where he said this would happen.
“But so there could be no mistake the
Government itself amended the Bill to
cope with every case invented by Play-
ford. It can’t now be alleged that in any
imaginable case under the Labor Bill a
widow, or her children under 21, will be
worse off, and in nearly every case she
will be better off, where she is inheriting
property up to the value of £19,000
and the figure is greater in the case of
primary-producing property.”
Labor s First Year . . .
The young Minister’s voice, a pleasant
compound of educated Australian and
upper-class English in tone, grew sharper
with distaste: “The LCL want to mis-
represent the fair and generous nature
of the reductions in taxation to the
average citizen because they want to
protect the wealthy. The insurance com-
panies don’t like having a profitable line
of policy sales diminished.”
I later discovered that a smear cam-
paign was conducted against Dunstan
when this Bil was first mooted, and that
rumors had been spread that he was “a
Melanesian orphan bastard” and that
the “Federal Government has found
that it can deport Dunstan any time it
likes”. The Attorney-General, who was
born in Fiji of Australian parents and
has lived in Adelaide for almost his
whole life, is too cool and confident to
be affected by such personal attacks.
Wherever the well-spring of his reform-
ist passion lies, it is certainly not in the
bitter marshes of envy and hatred of the
local Establishment. Mention of the
Adelaide Club causes him to laugh
rather than sneer.
Masked by the youthful grin and
rather innocent gaze is a mental appa-


By BRIAN BUCKLEY
ratus which in the jargon of the trade is
known as “a shrewd and calculating
political brain”. In Opposition in the
Legislative Assembly from 1953, when
he was 27, until March, 1965, he grew
in stature as an incisive and fluent op-
ponent of Treasury policies, and intro-
duced more private member’s bills than
any other MP of the post-war period. He
uses a sharp eye and a quick ear against
his opponents; sharp and quick enough
to cause even so tough an old cam-
paigner as Sir Thomas Playford to be
wary.
Last year Playford made the follow-
ing statement in the House during the
debate on the State Lottery Referendum
Bill: “We should hold a referendum
only in this House and authorise a
general referendum only if we are satis-
fied that the question to be put before
the people is one from which they can
gain advantage. One does not put poison
in the hands of children”, said the
paternal Sir Thomas.
Dunstan will never let the former
Premier forget that statement. He seized
on it fast at the time and, after casti-
gating Playford in the House, paraded
it before the city over Station SKA:
"Mark the position he takes (the well-
modulated Fabian tones tight with
scorn) —the people cannot be trrsted to
decide what is good for themselves
they are children, and not to be trusted
to decide that a lottery is like poison.
“From a Parliamentarian, supposedly
responsible to the people, such a dicta-
torial and arrogant attitude leaves one
boggling in amazement. Just who does
he think he is? Why does he arrogate to
himself the right to tell people of this
State that he knows what is good for
them that he considers them child-
ren who cannot as citizens make up their
OWn minds as to what is good and what
ls bad.” No great subtlety or rhetoric,
perhaps, in this particular attack; but
mere is sound politics, the kind of poli-
tlcs which would gather, without too
much effort, further arts and crafts if it
were confronted with a more sophisti-
eated and Federal challenge.
A middle-class radical, apparently
acking any urge to construct his political
Pfogranune on doctrines of class war-
fare and anti-Americanism (he was re-
luctant to talk much about it but my
guess is that privately he feels the
American presence in Vietnam is
necessary, though he would probably
prefer that Australia had not sent
troops), Dunstan would not be en-
couraged in Federal ambitions by Clyde
Cameron and his followers in the ALP
State machine.
For one thing he has been a consis-
tent supporter of Whitlam and Wynd-
ham and, for another, although he shares
the typical English-speaking liberal’s
failure to face realistically the unpleas-
ant political consequences which flow
from the facts of power and violence in
the modern world, his instincts could
never lead him to admire totalitarian-
ism or its servants. I asked Dunstan if
he were attracted to Federal politics and
career.
FRANK WALSH
“Well, certainly not at the moment.
There’s so much to be done here for one
thing. I did not spend most of my adult
life waiting impatiently on the Opposi-
tion benches for nothing. In many ways
this State is still in the nineteenth
century. It is the task of the present
Government to bring it into the mid-
twentieth century. There were some
saving features in the Playford adminis-
tration, but they had so many blind
spots, so many almost Victorian pre-
judices about the superior rights of the
landed gentry; there were so many things
left undone.” For instance?
4 Social welfare provisions, among many
other things. The Labor Government has
for more than a generation watched this
State sink back behind the rest in pro-
visions for public relief, in child welfare,
and assistance for the needy. The in-
ability of wives to enforce maintenance
obligations on deserting husbands has
been a scandal and source of suffering to
many broken families. Our new Social
Welfare Act attempts to remedy a situa-
tion created by half a century of neglect.”
Another controversial Bill introduced
by Dunstan is the Evidence Bill, which
has been severely attacked by both the
Press and legal authorities. It aims to
restrict the publication of criminal pro-
ceedings in South Australian courts.
Dunstan was not impressed when re-
minded of the comment of the Lord
Chief Justice of England, Lord Parker,
who declared a couple of months back:
“The greatest publicity should be given
to crime and criminal proceedings.” The
Press has strenuously quoted the words
of the famous Lord Denning: “In dark-
ness and secrecy justice can have no
place. If there is any misconduct on the
part of the judge, any bias or prejudice,
there is a reporter to keep an eye on
him. If there is any unfairness it is
noted down.”
Dunstan is not impressed by the
motives of those campaigning against
him on this issue. “One can, of course,
expect objections from those newspapers
which make money out of publishing
court proceedings.” True, but not the
whole truth. The answer also seemed to
reveal a disdain, bordering on arrogance,
towards the politician’s perhaps un-
pleasant but nonetheless necessary task
of winning, if not the support, at least
the respect and some of the confidence
of the major organs of public opinion.
This disregard for the public relations
touch is shared by many of Dunstan’s
Cabinet colleagues. There is a marked
contrast between the public relations of
the West Australian and South Aus-
tralian Governments. The former is very
PR-conscious and has its own PR
department. Every minister regards
himself as a salesman for the State and
the Government. Brochures, pamphlets
and catalogues, reciting the achieve-
ments and plans of the administration
abound. Not only must rapid economic

development be done; it must very much
be seen to be done.
I tried to return to the Federal Party,
to Federal Conference and Executive,
to the possibilities of Labor ever gaining
Federal office again. Dunstan has been
a keen operator on the Federal machine
level in the past and would be a quick
contender for the Labor shadow cabinet,
if he chose to go to Canberra, but he was
not much interested in all that and
seemed impatient to return the challenges,
problems and achievements of the new
State Government.
Labor’s pacemaker
jpV)R some years, the considerable ener-
gies of Don Dunstan will be direc-
ted to framing and administering the
social and legal reforms he can steer
past the Opposition majority in the
Legislative Council: reforms such as the
new and comprehensive Social Welfare
Bill, the granting of land rights to
Aborginals, the closing of huge loop-
holes in the State's company legislation,
the appointment of women to juries,
making the machinery for enforcing
maintenance orders workable, and
attempting, before it is too late, to estab-
lish effective town planning amidst the
chaos that threatens to become Adelaide.
If power behind the throne is too
strong a description, Dunstan is certainly
the pacemaker of the new administra-
tion; and whereas the dynamo of the
Liberal and Country League Govern-
ment, Sir Thomas Playford, was aptly
described by a State political commen-
tator as “always willing to spend on
things but prudent with spending on
people”, the present pacemaker is
manifestly concerned with people, their
rights and their welfare. I left the inter-
view convinced that there were many of
the elements of a future national Labor
leader in the constitution of the young
Attorney-General. I wondered, as he
drove me back into the baking city,
whether he had the national vision, and
international realism, to let his talents
run their full course.
Dunstan is not the only man of marked
ability in the present Government. The
nine-man Cabinet also contains such
able politicians and administrators as
Mr Gabriel Bywaters, the Minister for
Agriculture, whose reputation has grown
enormously in the past twelve months;
and Mr Ron Loveday, Minister for
Education. Ready to assume Cabinet
rank at the first opportunity are Govern-
ment Whip, Mr Jack Jennings, and the
young university economist, Mr H. Hud-
son, whose vigorous campaign in the last
election caused a 6 p.c. swing to Labor
in Glenelg.
The Premier, Mr Frank Walsh, has
proved surprisingly successful so far in
leading the new administration. A man
with no pretensions to oratory, and one
of the few Catholic leaders in a Party
with strong Methodist traditions, Walsh
has surprised many in his own Party with
the strength of his control of the chiefs
of the Public Service. Under Playford
some of the top permanent officials had
far more effective power than members
of the LCL Cabinet and it was predict-
ed that Walsh would have his hands full
handling them. Apart from a couple of
resignations he has been able so far
to establish his authority with a mini-
mum of reaction. An ex-stonemason who
once worked on Parliament House,
Walsh provides a representative image
for his Government.
The new Labor leaders of South Aus-
tralia have been rather too concerned
with the demands and problems of office
to worry about such things as popularity;
which in almost every way is admirable,
but not, unfortunately, very practical
politics. They are inclined to appear,
collectively, as rather grim, unsmiling,
and earnest, in a similar manner to the
way the Chifley Government appeared
from 1945 to 1949. South Australian
Labor faces the same danger of having
its best and most nobly conceived pro-
jects given less consideration than they
merit, and of becoming wrongly
characterised in the popular imagination
as dogged rather than diligent, interfering
rather than welfarist, and bureaucratic
rather than just. - y
Walsh and his Government have made
blunders in the presentation of their case
both to Parliament and the State. The
raising of water rates soon after they
took office was done most clumsily, and
the Succession Duties Bill, which should
have won general applause, was not well
handled; in the latter case the Govern-
ment was ambushed in the House by
Playford, who managed to arouse a fair
amount of opposition to the Bill, even
from those who actually stood to gain
from it. Sir Thomas has proved himself
just as formidable in Opposition as he
was in Premiership. There is no time
limit for speeches in the South Australian
Parliament and the LCL has used the
tactic of filibustering to seriously impede
the Government’s legislative programme.
Many sittings have lasted well into the
small hours of the morning and one sit-
ting ran for 22 hours. Parliament has
now assembled, over a month earlier than
usual, so that the Government can
attempt to press on with its scheduled
list of Bills. Some of these deserve
national attention.
A pioneering piece of legislation intro-
duced by the Walsh Government is the
granting of land rights to Aborigines,.

peati countries which contain colored
minorities of indigenous peoples have
granted proprietory land rights to them,
Australian governments have previously
failed to follow this lead, an omission
which has been strongly resented by
Aboriginal leaders.
The whole world knows that some
tribes of American Indians have grown
wealthy from mineral and oil royalties
received from United States and Canadian
companies, but there has been no pro-
vision for the possibility of similar good
fortune befalling Australian natives.
When bauxite was discovered at Weipa
in North Queensland, for example, the
Aborigines were promptly removed to
a smaller reserve down the coast. New
quarters were erected for them, but they
were paid no direct compensation and
they receive no royalties from those who
are extracting the rich aluminium ore
from the cliffs and grounds of their old
reserve. The new Government is setting
up an Aborigines’ Land Trust, adminis-
tered by a Board consisting entirely of
Aborigines, to which the present Crown
Lands reserve for Aborigines, and other
Crown Lands, will be transferred. The
decisions of the Trust will be subject only
to the veto of the Minister.
But the major problem of the Gov-
ernment is getting its Bills past the Legis-
lative Council. In the patrician 20-mem-
ber Upper House the Government is
out-voted 16 to 4. The LCL has so far
preferred to tamper with and amend
Bills rather than reject them outright,
but a number of important measures,
including electoral reform which will be
tabled this session, face a difficult time in
the Upper House. The Premier’s problem
is that there is no adequate constitutional
provision for breaking the deadlock. If
the Legislative Council rejects an im-
portant Bill the Government may then
hold an election for the Lower House.
If it wins back its majority in the House
of Assembly and its proposal is again
rejected by the Council, both Houses can
then be dissolved and an election held
for both. But since voting for the Council
1S not compulsory, and because three
mral districts (containing about 30 per
cent of the voters) elect 12 of the 20
members of the Council it is most likely
that the LCL majority will be returned.
Without a change in the electoral system
Labor wall always be out-voted in the
Upper Chamber, and therefore it is un-
-I'Lely that it will be able to introduce the
electoral reforms necessary to give it
control of both Houses. As one observer
Put it: “Parliament holds the Constitution
ltse 'f in mid-air, and the Constitution
supports the composition of Parliament
® a snake with its tail in its mouth.”
Last year’s defeat of the Liberal-
ountry League Government after a
deration of political office was no shock
to political observers inside the State, but
it was received with surprise by many
outside: the South Australian alleged
gerrymander of the electorate has been
notorious for years in most literate parts
of the Western world and has been held
worthy of mention in political text-books
in both Britain and the USA. The elec-
toral boundaries established by the Play-
ford Government were not, however,
typical gerrymanders. There was no basic
jigsaw of electoral districts transferring
pockets of liberal votes from safe seats
to otherwise marginal ones.
The basic electoral injustice, which
the present Government will soon attempt
to alter, lies in the 2:1 ratio of country
seats to city seats, a circumstance which
counts heavily against the Labor Party.
In 1936 this meant that a country vote
was worth two and three-quarter
times as much as a city vote, and by the
mid-’fifties, because of the relative in-
crease in urban population this ratio
had worsened to three and one-third to
one. When Playford ruled, the Labor
member for Port Adelaide was able to
claim that he represented more electors
than the Premier, the Minister for Lands,
and Minister for Works, the Minister
for Agriculture, and the Speaker com-
bined.
Play ford’s Scylla
Industrialisation and increased immi-
gration, the policies which were very
much the personal passion of Sir
Thomas Playford, were finally respon-
sible for his defeat. The opening up of
new areas for industry, the spilling over
of new housing trust areas into formerly
safe Liberal seats, and the fact that a
high proportion of migrants to South
Australia come from British working-
class origins and are born Labor voters,
has gradually changed the balance of the
electorate. The Playford Government
postponed attempting to alter the elec-
toral boundaries further in its own favor
a trifle too long. After the election before
last it returned to office lacking the abso-
lute majority necessary to force through
constitutional measures such as electoral
reform. It had always been fixed in
South Australian political mythology
that Labor could not win office unless it
gained more than 60 per cent of the
Legislative Assembly vote, but, assisted
by migration and industrial development,
the ALP was able to claim tenancy of
Uncle Tom's Cabin with a 57 per cent
vote.
Labor’s testing challenge in the
present Parliamentary session, now that
it has at last won the Treasury benches,
is to steer some kind of electoral re-
form past the Scylla of Playford’s fili-
bustering in the Lower House and the
Charybdis of the LCL Council majority.


SIMPSON
Hard? Humorless? A great
captain? How Simpson
Can Bobby Simpson, the 30-year-old
New South Welshman who has led
Australia through this Test series
with England, be listed among the greats
among those who were not only suc-
cessful on the playing field but also on
the wider national stage? Is he, as some
critics say, hard, humorless and remorse-
less, a youngster who carried the chip
of frustration on his shoulder for too
long? Did he sometimes play for himself
rather than his team? Was he sometimes
too critical and outspoken on the ability
of some with whom he played?
These criticisms have been heard.
Speaking as one who has an experience
of politics as well as the sporting world,
my feeling is that this sort of criticism
comes too readily to many Australians.
More often than not, the criticisms arise
out of envy. The secret of success, some-
body once wrote, is known only to those
who have not succeeded.
The captain of an Australian Test
team has to be more than a superb
individual player, prepared to accept
national responsibility; he has to be an
ambassador, a father confessor, a
diplomat, an arbitrator and a counsellor.
He must be agile with the Press and
present a good image on television. He
must be the smoother of the ruffled feel-
ings of an endless procession of “prima
donnas”, groundsmen, officials and hosts
whose ambitions to entertain visiting
elevens do not fit into a programme of
continual matches and seemingly endless
travel. How does Simpson conform with
these criteria?
Simpson grafted his way up through the
various grades of cricket —like everybody
else who has succeeded although he
came to the top much more quickly than
most. For a whole month, when aged
15, he went to the Petersham nets and
was never chosen in a side. He
persevered. The next year he .was play-
ing for NSW, six months older than lan
Craig, the youngest ever to play for
NSW.
He w'as a clerk at the Water Board.
“But 1 always hoped to make my name
at cricket,” he told me, “although, as a
youngster, I was a real thumper. I would
hook like hell. I tried on purpose to get
the bowler to drop them short at me.”
The time was to come when Simpson
did not like the ball dropped short at
him but I think that was because of a
broken nose, at 18, suffered in the Sydney
nets.
Keith Miller, the NSW captain, was
an admirer of Simpson. Miller had
Barnes' and Morris to open and himself
at first wicket. “Then there was a bunch
of young chaps and Simpson was one of
them,” said Miller. “I could never w 7 ork
out their batting order. I told them to
toss up. It was another matter, I
noticed, when it came to somebody going
in near stumps. There would be some
duck-shoving but not with young Simp-
son. He would volunteer for the job. I
liked him for that.”
When he was 18, an experience with
Ten Hutton at Sydney left Simpson with
memories of a certain English approach
that 12 years haven’t eradicated. He was
98. A century against the Englishmen
for a lad of 18 was the vision splendid.
A few drops of rain fell and Hutton,
not to his credit, fled the field. Young
Simpson stayed at the w'icket and the
umpires had to summon skipper Hutton
back from the pavilion. Simpson, his
concentration probably broken, was out
next ball. This was one “chip” he carried
to Old Trafford in 1964.
In 1956 Simpson went to Perth to
work with WA newspapers. He reasoned
he would get more cricket there, batting
twice in Shield matches, and more bowl-
ing. He wrote a weekly article and wrote
it well. He liked Perth and its people.
He went on tour to New Zealand and got
close to Neil Harvey, who suggested
Simpson should become an opener. Laker
had shattered the fibre of the Australians
in England in 1956 and they were over-
conscious of the ball spinning into them.
So Simpson changed his technique
playing defensively side-on and with bat
and pad together to off-spin.
This became a fetish with him, to the
detriment, I think, of his classical style
of play. Runs became uppermost with
him, not so much the way they were
made. He went to South Africa and had
only a moderate tour. Four days after
his return he married Meg McCarthy,
a pretty Sydney stenographer whom he
met some years before at a dancing
studio where Simpson went to improve
his batting footwork and his social
graces.
Now, Simpson is by a mile the best
slip I have seen —and he has the smallest
fingers. His technique in the slips is un-
rivalled. He crouches and relaxes and
rises only as the bal l is bowled, his con-
centration coming alert in a split second.
If possible, he will not catch in front
of his body. The ball must come to him.
Going forward, he says, makes the
fingers taut. If a catch is between his
navel and his shoulders he lets the ball
hit his body and then closes his fingers
over it. 1 have never heard the like of
this before. He has taken phenomenal
catches in the slips, sometimes behind
the ’keeper and, once at Nottingham,
getting a catch behind Redpath, at second
slip, after the latter had made a clean
miss. Simpson says he would just as soon
make a good slip catch as make a
century.
Peter May brought his Englishmen to
Australia and Simpson was 12th man for
the first Test. He played in the second
and was out, lbw, for nil to a ball which
he nicked. He was 12th for the third
Test and then strangely dropped. He
wasn’t chosen for India and Pakistan.

This was tough treatment for a gifted
young player and seemed to suggest he
was out of favor at the top. The iron
was entering his cricketing soul and he
accepted an offer to play Lancashire
League with Accrington.
So off went the young valiant Simpson
pair to Lancashire, a county of realism,
of no nonsense. Simpson says the
cricket there improved his technique
tremendously. It obviously did. As the
club’s professional, he had to succeed.
His team-mates back home said he re-
turned “run-hungry”, with an embittered
desire to show the selectors and every-
body else who wished to see how much
better he was than some chosen over
him for India. Simpson will not concede
now that he ever had ruffled feelings
over his treatment in those early days
but time, I feel, has erased much. And
he is now top dog.
In five matches in the ’Tll-show-them
season” Simpson made over 900 runs.
His 240 not out against NSW gave him
warm pleasure. He got 230 not out
against Queensland, and when the Aus-
tralian team returned from India, Simp-
son made 161 not out in Sydney against
NSW, which had all its stars. This gave
Simpson, one felt, a sadistic and under-
standable pleasure. Cricketers will note
the “not outs”. Simpson at this stage
gave nothing away and certainly not his
innings.
Back in the Test team, Simpson had
a hard season against the West Indies
here. It was obvious he didn’t like

He looked his feelings as he drew away,
but he picked the bumpers well. He was
always at home when the ball was on
the stumps. He lacec. Hall in Melbourne
°nce, getting 27 in two opening overs.
Benaud had instructed Simpson to give
Hall “the treatment’ .
Simpson made a big decision when,
after the 1961 tour of England, he
decided to leave Perth and return to his
native Sydney. He could sniff the retire-
ment of Benaud as Australian skipper
a nd, as when a Cabinet is being chosen,
felt he should be on hand. Perth was
a little distant. He had joined, now, the
British Tobacco Company and they liked
Ms approach as a salesman . . . although
he was a non-smoker!
“We don’t employ sportsmen as such,”
a director told me. “We want young
men who are going places after their
sport. Simpson appealed to us. He was
a hard worker, keen, who pulled his
weight. We shifted him to public
relations. He had tapes made of his
voice. He took lessons in elocution. He
was always improving himself. He was
always available to address clubs and
associations. He wanted the experience.”
And Simpson wanted the Australian
captaincy and the plums at the top of
the tree. He worked very hard from
1961 onwards, but I think some in the
cricket world also worked hard on Simp-
son. He was told he could lead Australia
but he would have to take a look at him-
self. Wasn’t he a little too critical of
other players? Didn’t he voice his
opinions of them a little too publicly?
Perhaps he had learnt to be critical in
Manchester. He had to work the iron
out of his cricketing soul. Did Simpson
change? He did, otherwise he would not
have become Australia’s captain.
“I think as skipper,” he says, “I have
become more tolerant of players and
their difficulties. I think I have learnt
that other outlooks on the game have
their merit.” He says, too, that he learnt
much from Benaud and Harvey. Simp-
son is now, with his players, exceedingly
popular. He never uses the big stick
with them. He is one of them.
Fleet Street had little warmth for him
in 1964. “Simpson and his team of no-
hopers have arrived,” some wrote, dub-
bing his side the worst ever to come from
Australia. Being the under-dog suited
Simpson. He won the series and his
initial critics found it hard to forgive him
for ramming their words down their type-
writers. They lambasted him over his
311 in 121 hours at Old Trafford. They
seemed oblivious of the fact that this
innings conformed to the prototype
played by Hutton against Australia at
the Oval in 1938, an innings lavishly
acclaimed by Fleet Street.
Simpson, last year, had a hard tour
of the West Indies. He knew what to
expect bouncers and bumpers and he
got plenty of them. So was repaid the
rough tactics Miller and Lindwall had
given the West Indies some years before
in Australia. I admired Simpson on that
tour. He did not like it but he made a
good fist of things. He had some dark
thoughts on the legitimacy of Griffith’s

action but, arriving home, he said merely
that “the umpires passed him and we
accepted him”.
In some ways, this summer has been
a tragedy for Simpson. He started with
a triple-century in Brisbane and might
well have had the biggest season ever
for an Australian. In the second innings,
he had his wrist broken by Peter Allan
—a fellow-employee of British Tobacco!
Then he got chicken-pox. Still an ill
man, he lifted a dispirited team from
the depths in Adelaide. He inspired
them in all ways.
Melbourne is ahead as I write and it
remains to be seen what it will bring out
cf Simpson. He will bust himself to win,
for Australia and for Simpson but, win
or lose, Simpson will do it graciously. By
hard work, by application, Simpson is
now a very polished young man and,
to boot, a successful business man.
BOBBY SIMPSON
In Canberra once, an irate MP, just
returned from a trip abroad, roasted
Simpson to me because he had asked
£lOOO as a fee for the Australian team
to be photographed alongside an Aus-
tralian-made car in a far-off land. “This
is trade for Australia,” said the MP.
“Well,” I said, “nobody seems to be in
anything these days for nothing, even
Politicians. These players make many
sacrifices. This firm makes huge profits.
Any ‘perks’ from a tour these days—
once it was different —go into a general
fund which all the players share. We
ttwst all be realistic.” And Simpson is
a realist.
No golfer has a sweeter swing than
Simpson. Playing off scratch, he has
Parred some of the best courses in the
World. He is a man of many parts but
the part to be appreciated is the family
one. Watch him as he comes and goes
at the Sydney Cricket Ground, his face
tanned, his haircut spiky, the deep lines
of hard training on his face, his walk
loose-limbed. He never fails to turn and
wave to the Ladies’ Stand —to his wife,
Meg, his six-year-old Debra and his four-
year-old Kim. “My Daddy is the best
golfer out there, isn’t he, Mummy?” says
Kim, a little confused.
“My aim in life at the moment," says
Simpson, “is to give to my family some-
thing for the sacrifices they have made
for me and cricket.” Which is why
Simpson, his wife and two daughters
sail soon for England. His parents, Jock
and Sarah, from Falkirk, Scotland, still
with the Scottish burr they had when
they migrated here in 1925, can be proud
of their “Rabbie”. In all ways, he has
done a good job.

Why do so many
businessmen fly TAA?
Businessmen in a free enterprise
economy appreciate the benefits of
competition.
They know that their best guarantee
of good service lies in having organi-
sations competing for their business.
This is the position in the Australian
Airline Industry.
IN OPEN COMPETITION
TAA enjoys no special privileges
over its competitors. It is subject to
income tax, payroll tax, sales tax, etc.,
normally met by other commercial
enterprises, and is required to pay a
dividend to the Federal Treasury out
of profits.
TAA has no exclusive rights to any
airline traffic, and must compete
openly for every passenger and pound
of air cargo.
BUSINESS EFFICIENCY
The fact that TAA gains the greater
overall share of the competitive pas-
senger market is indicative of TAA’s
business efficiency.
The continued business success of
TAA helps ensure the competition
vital to a healthy airline industry.
BENEFITS OF COMPETITION
This competition guarantees that
every Australian will continue to
enjoy the right to choose by which
airline he will fly, or consign air cargo.
Supporters of free enterprise, in
placing business with TAA, are pre-
serving for themselves these benefits of
business competition in the airline
industry.
This is one reason why so many
businessmen fly with us. Another is
that they simply prefer to fly TAA.

ON THE MARGIN
Drink-waiter’s Tail Well Up
Ihad some worry this summer over
the career prospects of my nephew,
Leslie. He is a trainee cricket broad-
caster. He started out with good quali-
fications —he got into double figures once
or twice for his school third eleven, and
he has a pleasant speaking voice. But
the lad showed an unfortunate reluc-
tance to learn the rules of his chosen
profession.
I noticed it the first afternoon when he
showed me his form as a commentator
at a club match.
“Johnson gave that ball a good hit —
it reached the boundary fence,” he said.
“You mean it rattled the pickets,” I
corrected him.
“Actually. 1 think it hit a wire gate,”
he said. The quibbling remark was
typical of his independent attitude.
“Gosh, 1 think the wicketkeeper has
caught Johnson! The ball
grazed the side of his bat,”
said Leslie in excitement.
“It didn’t graze his bat. It
got an edge” I told him.
“Yes, Johnson is out!” he
cried.
“No, no. You should say
the umpire has raised his
finger,” 1 said irritably.
“Look, Leslie, if you’re going to do this
job you’ve go to learn the language.”
He promised, rather resentfully, to try
to do better. There was a pause while
Johnson walked off and the new batsman
came out. To my dismay, Leslie re-
mained silent.
“Come on, say something!” I said.
“But there’s nothing happening,” he
replied.
“Well, find something! Look for a sea-
gull on the pitch, or an aeroplane flying
overhead, or a dog walking on the
ground.”
“All I can see is a sparrow over there,”
he said miserably. “Now it’s flown
away.”
“All right then —give ’em history and
statistics. Say it’s a remarkable co-
incidence that Johnson was caught be-
hind for 16 here today, because on this
very same ground five years ago he was
caught behind for 16. And on that
occasion he made the same mistake
he poked his bat uncertainly at a good-
length ball turning slightly from the off.
The bowler was a left-hander that time
too, Fred McDill, the medium - pace
veteran, who finished the match with 8
for 62.”
“But I don’t know whether all that is
true,” said Leslie.
“Neither do I but who cares? Your
job is to keep talking,” I told him.
The new batsman, Hopgood by name,
was facing the bowler Leslie resumed
his commentary.
“Hopgood tapped the balL forward,”
he said. “He’s scored his first run, but
he just got home in time.”
I put my head in my hands despair-
ingly.
“Listen, Leslie,” I sain. “You’re sup-
posed to say ‘He opened his account
with a cheeky single’. Surely you know
that?”
It was the end of the over, and Leslie
again lapsed into silence.
“Hurry up, get talking,” I said. “Read
the figures on the scoreboard! Say what
new positions the fieldsmen
have taken!”
“But I don’t know their
names.”
“Never mind make up
some names! Say ‘Tomkins
has dropped back to deep
mid-on and Wadsley is
coming in to the gully’.
Things like that.”
Leslie’s trouble, apart from nervous-
ness, was a reluctance to use technical
terms. He seemed to think his com-
mentary should be understandable to
the lay listener. I put him right on this
very firmly: “Use all the cricket words
you can. Never miss a chance to mention
the popping crease and the drink-
waiter,” I said.
Although I was a little harsh with
him, my advice had effect. I heard Leslie
give another commentary last week, and
he had improved. He rattled on with con-
fidence:
“Jones has been sent in as night-
watchman. He’s doing some gardening
near the popping crease,” he said. “Hob-
son sent up a Chinaman this time, giving
the ball plenty of air. It caught a thick
edge; they’ve stolen a cheeky single.
Jones has escaped the dreaded pair, and
our boys’ tails are well up. A flight of
18 seagulls passed overhead as Hobson
gathered the return from deep third
man. Hobson’s figures now are two for
46, the same as he had at stumps on
November 18, 1961.”
I believe Leslie may have a future in
broadcasting after all.

THE INTELLIGENT WOMANS GUIDE
Shopping Notes
Just try to buy something the shop
girl hasn’t heard of yet. Like a “no-
bra” brassiere you saw advertised
in an English magazine. Try to describe
it: transparent nylon, cut on the bias, no
embroidery, stitching, padding or other
extraneous matter. ‘What you want is
some kind of a sling,” she suggests, im-
plying that your fractured breasts prob-
ably need it, too. “We have never had
anything like that.” (God knows what
orgies, say her eyebrows, you might get
up to with your breasts in a kind of
sling.) Two weeks later the same store is
advertising just what you wanted, saying,
“Discriminating women can again buy
these exclusive imports from USA. Those
who have always worn them will tell you
there is nothing like the lightness and
smooth chic of these wel 1 known invisi-
bras.”
Or a perfume you bought on your trip
to France. “Perhaps it is called something
else, madam? We stock all the well-
known brands of perfume. There can’t
have been much demand for it. It is
probably too heavy for our climate.”
Which means you can’t even get a
simple name right (I once had this
trouble with a perfume called “S”); you
are in the habit of buying perfume con-
cocted by some fly-by-night chemist in the
ghettoes of Europe; your personal effluvia
are so strong that only something Mata
Hari might have favored has any effect.
Or something like powdered, black eye
shadow. “No dear, you’re too pale for
black eye shadow. We have powdered
azure, or elegant grey or soft turquoise
that would suit you nicely. What you
need more than anything is some eye
cream. You shouldn’t have neglected
those wrinkles for so long, dear. Yes,
that is a black powder. But it’s for eye-
brows. I don’t think you could use it for
eyelids. It’s not made for that. We
don’t have any powdered, black eye
shadow. I don’t think you should. With
that skin you should use brown.”
A Note on
Bulk Buying
Bulk buying is all very well, but there
are certain elementary principles
that have to be learnt.
In a fine frenzy of New Year economy,
I bought a vast collection of paper tissues
and tooth paste from a wholesaler.
Opening the account was simple, but
there were too many people there to
leave my order that day. So, the next day
I telephoned. Yes, they had the brand of
tissues I wanted. How many did I need?
A good question. “How do they come?”
“Oh, I can’t tell you that, madam, I can
only take your order.” “A carton? Yes
a carton of lilac tissues. Tooth paste? A
gross?” It sounded a convincing profes-
sional quality. And a gross of bath soap.
I hung up and turned to my daughter.
“How many is a gross?” “A hundred
and forty four.” “What?!” I was unable
to find the girl I had been talking to a
few minutes before. She was doubtless
gathering up one hundred and forty four
cakes of bath soap.
Well, 1 have just received the order.
I forgot to say what size packet of
tissues to put in the carton and am
stuck with a size we use up in about
three hours, necessitating some vigorous
gymnastics to acquire more (the only
storage cupboard that would hold them
is about seven feet off the ground). I
was spared a gross of bath soap because
they didn’t have any of the brand I
wanted at all. And I have a cupboard
full of four one-dozen packets of tooth
paste, which should take me four years
to use up.
We get two and a half per cent off
for paying cash (if we can rake up the
enormous sum), and I can buy both
tooth paste and tissues as specials three
pence cheaper at my local supermarket.
CLARISSA BLACK


AROUND MELBOURNE
The Big Strike and Late Closing
Life without Coronation Street
Perhaps the most significant news
of last week’s strike was that
the union strong man, Mr M. C.
Jordan, became a grandfather. We
had lovely front page pictures of our
Trades Hall Council Secretary,
cuddling his grandchild, Mandy Susan,
71b. 13oz. Indeed in strike-bound
Melbourne “The Age” conducted this
important interview: “Age”: Will the
baby soften your hard line over the
strike?
Jordan: No, no, I don’t think so.
“Age”: Will you visit your daugh-
ter-in-law today? If so, how?
Jordan: By car, I think.
However, to be honest, I do not
feel that Mandy Susan, 71b. 13 oz.,
was an important factor in the strike.
I believe that late hotel hours were
behind it all and this column is plan-
ning to get behind the Principal of
the Methodist Ladies’ College, the
Reverend Dr A. H. Wood, for a 6
o’clock closing movement in Victoria.
Originally the strike was to have been
before Christmas, but as Sir Henry
Bolte put it, “they squibbed it”. Un-
questionably it was the time spent
after 6 o'clock that - gave them the
courage to go ahead this time with
their remarkable demands for four
weeks’ annual leave for State Govern-
ment workers.
It was a ghastly few days, no hot
water, warm beer, no trains, no trams,
candle-light—and TV reduced to al-
most nothing. You will appreciate the
agony of it all when I tell you that we
had to go without our
regular sessions of Coro-
nation Street and Peyton
Place.
Most of the theatres
were closed, except that
the Playboy Club in South
Yarra bravely carried on
by candlelight. But, frank-
ly, if I am to carry on a
dignified campaign for 6
o’clock closing I prefer to
be associated with my
bunnies not in shadowy
candle-power but in the
purity of full electric light.
So with no TV, no
good theatre, not even an
ABC concert, what was
there to do but go out
and drink, and this is a
good opportunity to give you our
report on 10 o’clock closing. The
city was so empty it was frightening.
I looked in at the Cathedral Hotel at
9 p.m. There was only one other
person in the bar, and we experienced
the sort of pure happiness of Crusoe
when suddenly he discovered Friday.
However, out in the suburbs, they
were doing better than ever, and Mr
Reg Dennis was a happy man. The
Dennis family have five hotels, and
Mr Dennis was happy indeed. His
headquarters is the Tower Hotel,
well-known as the last oasis on the
edge of the great dry-area-desert of
Camberwell. He had candles on all
the tables and in the bar and he was
being utterly honest about the cooling
of his beer. He had adopted picnic-
race-meeting conditions. He had put
all his barrels in 44-gallon drums
packed in brine.
Said Mr Dennis: “We’re going very
well. We’re serving a continuous buf-
fet from 11.30 a.m. to 11.30 p.m.
We’ve put a carpet in our saloon and
public bars, wall-to-wall, a good
heavy Axminster it is. At 7 o’clock
we start off with the dance band and
at 10.30 we have the guest artists,
this week Dorothy Baker and Johnny
Rohan. I tell you, we’re spending
£350 a week on entertainment at each
of our hotels. We get about 350
people up ’til 10 o’clock, then about
150 stay ’til 11.30. We get a late per-
mit if we’re serving meals.”
The vital question: what was the
"I think I've eaten part of your handbag."
average age? He said, “Twenty-three.”
The older people came in the first
week out of curiosity, but not many
now. Then, according to the statistics,
the average consumption of beer was
six glasses per head.
The smarter restaurants also were
very happy. Outside Capers in Col-
lins Street there was a sign “Hurray,
beer is here through February
complimentary drinks for all at 11
p.m. New Era. Relax and enjoy
yourself until midnight.” You must
appreciate that under the Old Order
restaurants had wine licences and the
Government considered it dangerous-
ly unlawful to drink beer outside a
hotel. Now all licensed restaurants
can serve beer. At Capers, Mr Peter
Shelmerdine also was happy.
And that’s another thing we want
to talk about. So far not one theatre
has taken advantage of the oppor-
tunity of putting in bars. We saw
ourselves wandering out after the
first act for scotch-and-water, or
even half way through the first act
if things weren’t so good. But so far
it is not to be. The problem is that
there are hardly any theatres, and
most of them are in darkness.
Then one wonders what effect 10
o’clock closing will have on the
theatres. That’s if people prefer to
drink beer looking at Dorothy Baker
at the Tower Hotel or taking their
beer in an ice bucket till midnight at
Capers. Your correspondent is wor-
ried about all this. He likes to see his
theatres thriving, he
worries about poor Chloe
in Young and Jackson’s
who has to expose her
nudity now for another
30 hours a week and even
looks back with nostalgia
to the old days when his
pub provided beer, noise-
free.
But there is just one
compensation. At 6.15
every night there used to
be the great Victorian
exodus across the Murray
into NSW for a drink.
Now all the thirsty South
Australians are swarming
across the border at 6.15
p.m., into Victoria.

MALCOLM MUGGERIDGE
Dying Cult of the
Church of England
Buffoons in holy orders
By MALCOLM MUGGERIDGE
It is not by chance that the vogue
word Establishment derives from the
Church of England. In England,
with the monarch its titular head, and
a largely pagan Parliament responsible
for its governance, this curious body has
hitherto been one of the main props of
the social and economic status quo.
Nominally, it remains so still, but the
actual support it offers proves, on ex-
amination, to be largely illusory; like one
of those painted pillars one sees on
Italian Renaissance buildings. Though
the Archbishop of Canterbury may take
precedence at ceremonial functions over
other officers of the Crown like the Prime
Minister, his effective authority, such as
it is, scarcely reaches beyond the ram-
shackle institution over which he presides.
In matters like divorce, homosexuality
and the so-called new morality the tide
is flowing strongly against the traditional
Christian position; often with the con-
nivance of eminent churchmen. Witness
the Archbishop’s own attitude towards
the Wolfenden report, not to mention
the Bishop of Woolwich’s at the Chat-
terley case.
Doctrinally and administratively the
Church of England is in a parlous con-
dition; liturgically, such disorder reigns
that, with the best will in the world, one
is hard put to it to decide whether one
is attending matins, evensong, holy
communion or some weird blend of all
three begotten by the BBC out of the
Tractarian Movement with Toe H inter-
vening.
The simple fact is that, were the
Anglican Church in England to be dis-
established, it would fall flat on its
face. Yet the connection is unlikely
to be broken in the near or ascer-
tainable future. A moribund church and
an ever more hedonistic civil power
cling together like two drunkards, each
one knowing he will collapse if he looses
hold on the other.
Some Gibbon, writing of these strange
times centuries hence, may get a wry
laugh out of the spectacle of parlia-
mentarians resolutely refusing to coun-
tenance changes in a prayer-book they
have rarely had occasion to open; of
Honorable and Right Honorable Mem-
bers ardent for the Thirty-Nine Articles
embodying (as the Royal Warrant puts
it) “the true Doctrine of the Church of
England agreeable to God’s Word”,
about which they know nothing, and
care less, and which few of the bishops
and clergy on whose behalf they are
legislating any longer even pretend to
believe, though all have solemnly assented
to them to become ordained.
A ribald scene indeed. Who would
ever suppose that a secular enterprise so
conducted could possibly thrive or, for
that matter, be permissible? Current pro.
fessional and even business standards
would preclude acceptance of a salaried
post on the strength of a consciously
fraudulent declaration. This, however, is
the recognised practice among the Angli-
can clergy. Hilaire Belloc used to say
that, when he considered the manner in
which the Roman Church had been con*
ducted, and by whom, he realised that
it must have been divinely inspired to
have survived at all. The saying applies
with even greater force to the Anglican
Church today; always assuming, of
course, that, in any real sense, it has
survived.
Because of its identification with the
State the church could be relied on in
times of crisis, like a war, or trouble
over the matrimonial intentions of a
recalcitrant monarch or princess, to rally
to the side of those, as the prayer-book
puts it, set in authority over us. In the
various wars of our time the church has
been insistent that God was on our side.
■ Even the annual party political con-
ferences have thought fit to procure a
benediction from the local vicar before
settling down to the more serious business
of jostling for position and devising
appropriate electoral bribes and allure-
ments.
If one were to pick on a single eminent
ecclesiastic as marking the switchover
from supporting the traditional Establish-
ment to looking benignly on the up-and-
coming Leftist one. it would unquestion-
ably be Archbishop William Temple.
This burly prelate set a fashion, which
has been assiduously copied, for trans-
lating hopes for a posthumous place in
paradise into expectations that more
comfortable and easy-going circumstances
may be forthcoming in this world.
Nothing, from the Church’s point of
view, could have been more disastrous.
Who gets to heaven and what con-
ditions are like there are matters about
which the clergy can speak without fear
of contradiction. By associating them-
selves with a prospectus for a kingdom
of heaven on earth, they and their
religion were necessarily implicated
when, as was inevitable, realisation
proved disappointing. The trouble with
earthly causes, however enlightened, is
that they sometimes triumph. How pain-
ful for Bishop Trevor Huddleston when
apartheid is finally abolished, and black
bully-boys take over from the white
ones in South Africa as they have in

other African territories! One of the
wisest of the sayings of the founder of
Christian religion was that His king-
dom was not of this world. Had He and
His followers fallen into the snare
of associating themselves with Jewish
nationalism the churches today, along
with all their other worries, might have
felt bound to offer a Christian defence
of the State of Israel.
Since Temple’s time Leftist clergymen
have proliferated. A few, like' the
late Bishop Barnes of Birmingham and
the former Dean of Canterbury, Dr
Hewlett Johnson, have been rewarded
with preferment in periods of Labor
Government; others, like the present
Bishop of Southwark, Dr Mervyn Stock-
wood, have received their reward
vicariously from Conservative adminis-
trations; yet others, like Canon Collins,
have lent an air of clerical decorum to
causes, like nuclear disarmament, which
might otherwise be considered subversive
and disreputable. Most, however, have
had to content themselves with shock-
ing their ever more minute and somno-
lent congregations, and with finding an
outlet for their, as they hope and be-
lieve, explosive views in their parish
magazines.
In such circumstances it is not sur-
prising that the ministry should attract
crackpots, eccentrics and oddities who
in happier times would have appeared
as characters in Waugh's earlier novels
rather than as beneficed clergymen.
Scarcely a day goes by but some
buffoon in holy orders makes an exhibi-
tion of himself in one way or another,
more often than not on the subject of
sex—that pons asinorum of our time.
Can it be wondered at, then, that the
Church’s voice, when heard, is more
often than not greeted with derision or
just ignored?
In an average English village today
Anglican worship has become little more
than a dying bourgeois cult. It never
occurs to most villagers that the church
is anything to do with them, apart from
the need for baptism, marriage and
burial.
Small wonder then, that the incum-
bent has little to say except to repeat
the old, traditional, clerical banalities,
lacing the sad brew with references to
the United Nations, apartheid and the
birth pill. He doubtless feels himself to
be redundant. The villagers stoically die
without his ministrations; they would re-
sent any interruption of their evening
telly if he ventured to make a call, and
have for long accustomed themselves to
cope without benefit of clergy with
minor misfortunes like pregnancy and
delinquency.

WATER IS A SIGNIFICANT
HIDDEN COST IN YOUR
BUSINESS.
That’s why a Westinghouse
Water Cooler is the Blue Chip
Investment
Some time today every member of your staff will
need a drink of water. How and where they get it,
and how long they take getting it, will cost you
money.
A Westinghouse Water Cooler strategically
located on your premises—significantly reduces
this cost so that it more than pays for itself.
But, since the Westinghouse water is chilled to
the right temperature to provide maximum refresh-
ment it also increases staff efficiency. This shows
up on the profit side of your ledger only
marginally each day, of course—but in significant
amounts over the year.
There’s a Westinghouse Water Cooler to suit every
application—3 distinct models, plus a range of
capacities—so you pay only for what you need.
A total of nearly 1,000,000 Westinghouse Water
Coolers have been made over the last 35 years
. . . proof of Westinghouse leadership in the field
of Water Coolers.

churches, though one may presume to
wonder how far it is due to the sheer
agonising boredom and emptiness of this
particular way of life, and how far to an
authentic spiritual awakening. In any
case, such pockets of a revived interest
in the church scarcely offset the other-
wise prevailing apathy. An ardent
Christian evangelist remarked to me
recently that, when he preaches the
Gospel nowadays, he finds no hostility,
still less any tendency to argue com-
batively; only total indifference and in-
comprehension.
A gnostics of my generation, whether
consciously or not, were still part of
a Christian history and tradition, which
has colored all their moral attitudes and
assumptions. This is so no longer. The
very language and terms of the Christian
religion are incomprehensible to a genera-
tion which hears nothing about them at
home, and for whom religious instruction
at school consists more often than not
of civics, sex or mental arithmetic.
It is, perhaps, absurd to suppose that
the Anglican Church in its present state,
or, it may be, ever in its history, could
measure up to so desperate a situation.
It never has been much given to fervor,
and has usually lost its zealots like New-
man and Wesley to the Roman Church
or non-conformity. Moderation has been
its watchword. I remember reading an
18th-century sermon which referred to
the “truly extraordinary behavior of
Judas Iscariot”, and there was the famous
case of a bishop who remarked that the
Ten Commandments were like an ex-
amination paper, with eight only to be
attempted. All this has had its charm,
as, up to a point, has the tolerance or
indifference which permitted one high
dignitary to proclaim from Canterbury
Cathedral the excellence of the most
brutally atheistic regime the world has
yet known, and another to assert in a
court of law that the perverse sexual
ravings of D. H. Lawrence were con-
ducive to Christian marriage.
Yet in existing circumstances such
bizarre offerings are like a sweet liqueur
to thirsty men. The thirst is very great;
much greater and more widespread than
is commonly supposed, as anyone who
has dealt at all with religious matters on
television must be aware. There is a
conscious and passionate awareness that
this morally appalling and spiritually im-
poverished affluent society in which we
live, with its accent everlastingly on con-
sumption and sensual indulgence of every
kind, is no better than a pigsty. I know
of no more satisfying statement of the
case for lifting our snouts out of the
trough than the words and music of
Anglican worship. Alas, they sound
hollowly today, intoned by dispirited
priests in near-empty churches.

MOON-SHOT?
Is Australia entering the space race? The sight of
this strange device remarkably like some science
fiction space vehicle aboard a Brambles heavy-
haulage rig may indeed have prompted some
Queenslanders to imagine that it was Australia’s
first space ship en route to the launching site.
The heavy load was in fact a pressure vessel for
the Amoco Refinery at Bulwer Island, Queensland.
Brambles Industrial Services in Brisbane handled
the pressure vessel from the time it arrived by sea
from Melbourne until it was installed at the
refinery.
The pressure vessel weighed 24 tons a little
heavy for a space ship was 41 feet long and 20
feet high.
The handling of the tank was a major operation.
After unloading from a ship at Brisbane, the vessel
was towed to the upstream end of Patrick’s Wharf
and placed into the Brisbane River by Brambles
crane. A launch towed it down-river to Pinkenba
where it was lifted from the water on to a
Brambles low-loader for the journey to Bulwer
Island.
u




Occasionally Brambles experts are faced
with a project which looks at first glance
. . . impossible. But experts do not like
to be outdone and Brambles men very
rarely are.
When the Swanbank Powerhouse in
Southern Queensland was under construc-
tion, Brambles was asked to lift and place
in position the main beams and crab-
winch for a 150-ton Gantry Crane. But the
end of the gantry rails, on which the beams
were to rest, could not have weight placed
upon them because the foundation work
was incomplete.

The beams were lifted under the final truss of the building
and placed on the main rails, which could support the weight.
Brambles men, after transporting the beams to the site, used
four cranes, each with a 110-foot jib to execute the lift.
One by one the cranes were unhooked from the beam; the hook
was moved over the truss and re-slung back on to the beam.
The heavy piece of equipment was then manoeuvred into
position.
The entire operation was controlled by two-way radios because
of the precision and timing required for the lift.

The case of Genial Sam demonstrates
CHEP’s willingness to offer service,
Another example is in CHEP’s fleet of ultra l
modern two-way radio-controlled service
trucks, always on stand-by to respond to a
client’s call at a moment’s notice.
The photograph shows an “exploded”
view of the equipment carried by each
skilled CHEP mechanic, enabling him to
give maximum on-the-spot service with the
minimum of delay.
Genial Sam McMahon of the Argyle Bond Stores had a
problem; his small vintage fork lift truck failed by a mere
nine inches to lift a pallet from the ground floor to the
first floor of the Store and he was faced with purchasing
a second truck to work only a few hours each week.
This would not be economical, and he asked CHEP to
help. CHEP were able to design and build a pair of forks
that wouid not reach the ground by twelve inches when
lowered, but which would give him the height he needed
when extended. The Department of Labour and Industry
approved the design and Sam is now more genial than
ever. He unloads his crates from the trucks to the first
floor with three inches to spare.

FEET OFF THE GROUND
Nicholls Crane Services, the South Australian crane
division of Brambles, is now using a new rubber-
mounted crane with a maximum height of lift of 210'
The new unit is a LIMA 500 T with lifting capacity up to
45 tons. The crane is shown at work on the waterfront
loading prefabricated buildings built by World Wide
Camps Ltd., of Elizabeth, South Australia, and des-
tined for Arabia.
A close look at the photograph shows that this crane
is lifting off its outriggers, and the wheels are off the
ground.

LETTERS
The Monarchy
SIR. — Speaking as a sub-intellectual
Hipster (and a lineal descendent from
an old colonial imperialist) I question
your derogation of “OZ’s” non-loyalty to
Royalty as schoolboy misanthropy. Mon-
archism is merely an insignificant hang-
over from a more superstitious age and
hardly justifies a giggle. However, its
side effects — painful bureaucratic en-
thusiasm (like herding thousands of
high school children, at incredible dis-
comfort, into the Showground for a 5-
second glimpse of the drive-past),
sycophantic politicians and Press hysteria
— surely earns contempt, viz., your own
cashing-in on Charlie’s landing with
boring feature articles and a colored
pin-up.
“OZ” does not satirise institutions or
attitudes simply because they are popular
— we are also prejudiced against some
minority groups. Finally, you blame us
for a blanket contempt of Australia. It
is unlikely, sir, that “OZ” would have
persevered for so many issues if its only
motivation was a hatred for the country
we hope some day will change.

SIR.—On November 20, The Bulle-
tin published an article by Mr Geoffrey
Dutton which contained this sentence:
“As Donald Horne observes in his chapter
on ‘Republican Australia,’ under our
present system we could never have a
John Kennedy in Australia.”
The next issue contained a rejoinder
in which I criticised a number of points
in the article, including this remark. Mr
Horne now complains (B. Feb., 22) that
I have attacked “alleged views of [his]
that are in fact not [his] views ... at
all ” If Mr Horne was not the author of
the inanity quoted by Mr Dutton, I can
understand his irritation at having it
ascribed to him. But in that case, he
should be complaining about Mr Dut-
ton’s behavior, not mine.

SIR. — Th e monarchy is such a favorite
subject for debate, and arguments for
an d against are so readily available, that
*1 would seem unnecessary in your three
ar ticles on the subject (B., Feb. 5) to
to offensive references to the
yueen of a personal nature, the over-
simplification of figures purporting to be
me cost to British taxpayers, and in the
case of the article by Frater in London,
profanity (“ ‘Christ,’ I muttered”) and
a questionable reference to Christ upon
the Cross. How is the argument advan-
ced, for example, by citing people who
regard the Queen as a “middle-aged
German woman”? As to cost, there
may be a debit item amounting to two
million pounds annually, but what about
Britain’s No. 2 multi-million industry,
tourism, to which the matchless pagean-
try of London life makes such a major
contribution? Take away the monarchy,
the mainspring and centre of such cere-
monies, and they would be meaningless.

Pornopolitics
SIR. The anthology on the Berkeley
Student Revolt, edited by Lipset and
Wolin, indicates the close connection
between the Berkeley crisis and the civil
rights movement, which provided the
leadership, the tactics and many of the
issues. Dr Knopfelmacher’s review of
this book (8., Feb. 5) recognised this
close connection, except in the context
of one of the most vital issues in the
crisis. Dr Knopfelmacher was critical of
those who supported the students’ demand
to advocate illegal off-campus activity.
“Illegal off-campus activity” was the
entire student participation in the civil
rights movement. Hardly an issue to be
brushed aside by slick analogies with the
Petrograd Soviet.
On the questions of “pornopolitics”,
Dr Knopfelmacher gives the impression
that it has started since the height of the
crisis (“since February 1965”). During
the crisis itself there were several
examples of the “filthy speech move-
ment”, e.g. students walking around
with placards displaying various four-
letter words. I tend to view this develop-
ment with a little less conspiracy than
Dr Knopfelmacher. Such words become
symbolic of a comprehensive reaction
against “the American way of life”. The
real point is that pornopolitics as a
basically inarticulate method of expres-
sing this inability to articulate social
protest has spread to Australia. For
example, the ALP Club at Sydney Uni-
versity used various words (for no ap-
parent purpose) in several leaflets it
issued in 1965. The student reaction at
Sydney University indicated clearly that
“pornopolitics” is politically harmful.

Agnostics and the ABC
SIR. While heartily endorsing Harold
Bayley's letter (8., Jan. 29) concerning
consideration for agnostics by the ABC,
I greatly fear that a few letters are not
likely to get us far. Perhaps only those
of us who have given both moral and
material support over many years to the
Rationalist movement in Britain really
appreciate how tough the struggle has
been. But since the Margaret Knight
lectures, the whole attitude of the BBC
has changed; so much so that from last
October the Humanist movement was
allotted six half-hour sessions.
But what effect is this likely to have
on the ABC? Well, I should say none at
all. ABC television is still cluttered up
with religious programmes, mostly pue-
rile stuff. In fact, at the present moment
there is a feature “In Search of St Paul”,
billed to last for ten Sundays (half-hour
sessions) and consisting of readings
from Acts. The pictures are quite good.
It seems abundantly clear that, for the
present at least, both radio and tele-
vision will persist in presenting, not what
the listeners and viewers might want, but
what the ABC thinks they ought to have.

Whose Academic Freedom?
SIR. There has been correspondence
in your columns and elsewhere over the
new Queensland University Act. The
Australian Academic Staff Association
has invested a great deal of effort in
opposing the Act, its main argument
being that universities will suffer in some
unspecified way if their governing bodies
do not contain a majority of on-campus
academics.
This argument is presented in such
a way as to imply that its validity is
self-evident. I find it inexplicable that
it has not been examined in the light of
events at Sydney University.
The conclusions that can be drawn
from this affair is that the Knopfelmacher
academics of Sydney University have
shown they are the very last people to be
entrusted with running a university.

VIETNAM
Through the Looking Glass
By EDMOND TAYLOR
Looking back at the time I spent in
South-east Asia, the remark of
a highly qualified veteran of the
struggle against Communist expansion
keeps coming back to mind. “The
basic books for an understanding of the
conflict the United States is waging in
Vietnam,” he told me, “have been writ-
ten by Lewis Carroll and Kafka.” I
think an adequate reference shelf should
also include some works of history deal-
ing with the fate of nations or govern-
ments France’s Fourth Republic,
among others that became involved
in half-hearted wars against whole-
hearted enemies, and possibly a volume
or two of Gibbon on the hazards of try-
ing to achieve cut-rate security by play-
ing one barbarian power against
another.
My notebooks covering two months’
travel and reporting in Vietnam, Laos,
and Thailand are peppered with direct
or indirect quotations from US military
and civilian authorities in the area re-
flecting, sometimes almost in caricature,
the through-the-looking-glass mentality
that the war in Vietnam seems to develop
among certain Americans in the em-
battled country itself no less than on
campuses or in editorial offices at home.
The ultimate example, I suppose, is con-
tained in the notes I jotted down immedi-
ately after being subjected to a back-
ground briefing on the Ho Chi-minh trail
by an American expert whom, before I
talked to him, I had assumed to have
outstanding qualifications for discussing
the problem: “Amazing talk briefing
followed by free-ranging exchange with
A this morning,” my notes read. “Writing
it up immediately because would begin
doubt own memory if I didn’t. A’s view
almost diametrically opposed to consen-
sus of Westmoreland’s staff in Saigon; he
agrees we can and should do more to
harass PAVN (North Vietnamese regu-
lar forces) moving along trail through
Laos and Cambodia to South Vietnam
but thinks would not be to our military
interest to block flow completely. Bet-
ter to fight PAVNS in South Vietnam
at end of their communication lines than
U P north at the country's border, he
ar gues. More PAVNS who arrive in South
Vietnam, the more we can dispose of
w ‘th least effort and therefore the faster
We can convince Hanoi aggression doesn’t
Pay. Sounds almost convincing way A
P uts it, but if argument sound why
harass Ho Chi-minh trail at all? Maybe
ySOM (US economic assistance organ-
nations) should set up joint project
w ‘th Hanoi to surface entire trail; that
way they could move even more PAVNS
south for us to deal with.”
It is probably just as well that the
rules governing such briefings and
most of the talks that a correspondent
r has with American or other Western
officials in South-east Asia—forbid any
close identification of the source, even
by function. The absurdities that one
hears are seldom a reliable index of the
intellectual calibre, professional compe-
tence, or patriotic dedication of the
official. Some of the most distressing
nonsense I listened to, especially in Sai-
gon and in Vientiane, came from
Americans noted among their colleagues
around the world for courage, integrity,
and tough-mindedness.
Not infrequently the speaker does not
himself believe what he is saying, but
for reasons of policy feels that it is his
duty to mislead the Press while trying
to avoid telling an outright lie. I strongly
suspect, for example, that A’s singular
SOUTH VIETNAM'S PREMIER KY
approach to the problem of the Ho Chi-
minh trail, perhaps the key strategic
issue of the war in Vietnam, was simply
the result of an instruction from some
superior authority to try to discourage
correspondents from playing it up at
that time, the time being the eve of the
Johnson peace offensive and of the visit
of Soviet Deputy-Premier Shelepin to
Hanoi.
The theory—or chimera —that if only
we display enough tact the Soviet Union
can be converted into a de facto ally of
the United States in Asia, sharing the
military burden of containing Chinese
expansion, especially in South-east Asia,
has a strong hold on the minds of a
number of US officials in the area,
especially among those with a New
Frontier background. Naturally, those
who believe in the doctrine of the Soviet
counterweight dread any intensification
or extension of the fighting in Vietnam
that might embarrass the Soviet leaders
vis-a-vis the Communist world and thus
make it more difficult for them to “co-
operate” with us in South-east Asia.
Any stepped-up US military activity
in Laos to interdict the Ho Chi-minh
trail is particularly and explicitly dis-
approved of by the people belonging to
this school of thought because, as one
of them explained to me, the Soviet
Union, as a signatory and guarantor of
the 1962 Geneva accords for the neutral-
isation of Laos, might take umbrage if
we violated them.
So far Moscow has taken no umbrage
over the more than 1500 violations of
the accords by North Vietnam as noted
by the International Control Commis-
sion, and indeed has preferred not to
notice the present substantial though
decently camouflaged US military activity
in Laos. Consequently, it is argued by
some hard-minded American diplomats
in the theatre that a sizeable increase of
US military pressure against the trail,
as desired by General William C. West-
moreland, could be effected without
major impact on our relations with Mos-
cow, provided we continue to pay lip
service to the fiction of Laotian neutral-
ity. But the we-can-count-on-Russia
school seems reluctant to accept any risk,
however slight, of offending Soviet sus-
ceptibilities at this time. Hence the ten-
dency to fall back on looking-glass logic
in assessing the strategic role of the
trail. (Ho Chi-minh’s own assessment of
it is indicated by the 10,000 or more
crack PAVN troops, not to mention the
30,000 to 40,000 Pathet Lao guerrillas,
permanently stationed on Laotian soil to
protect the flow of reinforcements for
the Vietcong in South Vietnam from
ground harassment by US or Royal Lao
forces.)
One of the reasons why proponents
of close co-operation with Soviet Russia
in Asia often sound like Alice—or like
a mixture of Alice and Walter Lipp-
mann is that there is a glaring dis-
parity between the avowed vagueness of
their objectives and the sacrifices, in
terms of American prestige or even of
American lives, they appear willing to


make in order to promote them. “Russia
is co-operating with us in India to help
India resist Chinese expansion,” one
well-informed spokesman said to me,
“but of course we can’t expect the
Soviets to go as far as that in Hanoi;
if they counterbalance Chinese influence
there to some degree it is probably a
good thing from our viewpoint, even if
it involves intensified Soviet military aid
to North Vietnam. Surely it would be
to our long-term interest if an increased
Soviet presence in South-east Asia led
to some reduction in both the Chinese
and the US presences there.”
The thesis that an increased Soviet
“presence” anywhere in Asia is advan-
tageous to US national interests seems
highly debatable, especially to someone
who, like myse’f, has had the oppor-
tunity to see what the supposed US-
Soviet co-operation in India really im-
plies. There may be a macabre logic in
tolerating increased Soviet military assis-
tance to North Vietnam, but it seems
stretching reason beyond the breaking
point to accept paralysing restrictions
on our conduct of the war in Vietnam
simply to enjoy the privilege of seeing
Russian rather than Chinese bullets kill
American soldiers. Yet to date that is
the only tangible benefit anyone can
promise from the enhancement of
Soviet influence in South-east Asia we
seem so anxious to encourage. If it is
true, as some say, that Moscow has
been urging Hanoi to adopt a more flex-
ible attitude toward peace negotiations,
no one as yet dares to claim he has
detected any reliable signs that Hanoi is
responsive to Soviet advice. Some of the
best-qualified US Asian experts doubt
seriously that the North Vietnamese
leaders could break loose from China
and modify their present unconditional-
victory policy even if they wanted to.
Occasionally a reporter who listens
carefully will pick up from certain dip-
lomatic sources both in the South-east
Asian capitals and in New Delhi what
appear to discreet hints of tacit Soviet-
US understandings on some subjects
dating back to the Kennedy-Khrushchev
meeting in Vienna in 1961—understand-
ings that go substantially beyond such
public agreements as the Test Ban
Treaty banning above-ground nuclear
tests or the 1962 Laos accords.
It is just ba,rely conceivable, there-
fore, that the top-secret files of the State
Department and the White House con-
tain evidence that, if it could be revealed,
might enable American representatives
in Asia to justify the hopes some of
them seem to place in co-operation with
Moscow as the key to peace in Vietnam
—and throughout this vast continent—
without sounding like the Mad Hatter.
A reporter lacking access to such evi-
dence. if it exists, can only view with
dismay what at best appears to be an
example of diplomatic professionalism
breaking free from the gravitational field
of twentieth-century political reality and
orbiting in a universe of pure fancy.
Some Americans one encounters, not-
ably in Saigon, seemingly go out otStheir
way to invent new and totally unneces-
sary taboos and purely theoretical dilem-
mas for themselves. One such was the
official who, according to my notes, was
already worrying last November—some-
what prematurely, it seemed to me —-
about the possibility of our inflicting
such a crushing defeat on Ho Chi-minh
that it would sweep away his regime and
cause North Vietnam itself to be swal-
lowed up by China, thereby “bringing
Chinese power down to the 17th parallel,
which clearly would not be to our long-
term interests in Asia”.
Then there was the senior official who
has demonstrated his personal courage
and patriotism by voluntarily remaining
in South Vietnam far longer than the
“The one task we cannot shirk in
Vietnam is finishing the job we com-
mitted ourselves to in the eyes of
Asia to complete . . ”
normal call of duty, but who argued
vehemently against bombing Hanoi on
the grounds that if w'e adopted such a
course the Vietcong would no longer
feel inhibited in unleashing all-out ter-
rorism against American installations in
Saigon. (Whatever inhibitions the Viet-
cong may have had, they bombed the
Metropole Hotel only a few days later.)
Perhaps it is impossible to win the
struggle in Vietnam—or even to avoid
a humiliating defeat unless we abandon
the whole concept of limited war and
cast off all the self-imposed restrictions
on its prosecution, regardless of the con-
sequences. Some of the rare and gener-
ally rather subdued hawks favor such a
course. Others, by no means dovelike
in their opposition to Communist ex-
pansionism. fear that through reckless
escalation of the Vietnam war we might
blunder —at a time and place of the
enemy’s chbosing—into a major conflict
with China. Moreover, these Americans
say, unlimited expansion of- the war in
Vietnam —or a policy of uninhibited
frightful ness in waging it —is not neces-
sary to achieve our essential objectives
there. Some hard decisions may yet
have to be taken, they admit, and some
carefully calculated risks accepted; all
that is needed is for the military to
display some initiative .and imagination in
applying the directives they have already
been given and in utilising the resources
now at their command.
Whether it is altogether fair to blame
the military establishment for what
strikes an impartial observer as the un-
deniably brass-bound conduct of the war
is hard to say. It would certainly be
unfair to pin the blame personally on
General Westmoreland, one of the most
hobbled and politically harassed grand
captains in the history of warfare, who
must shoulder the essential responsibili.
ties of a theatre commander without
having the traditional authority of one.
The problem of the Ho Chi-minh trail
illustrates some of the deficiencies of
our approach.
Westmoreland and his staff are said
to be convinced that more effective mea-
sures than the bombing attacks we were
making regularly before the Johnson
aerial truce are needed to choke off the
flow of Vietcong reinforcements from
North Vietnam (now estimated at more
than 2500 a month). The obvious place
to cut the trail (actually a complex of
roads, trails, and waterways) is where
it runs through Laos, though some US
experts in Saigon attach almost as
much stragetic importance to the Com-
munist bases and supply line in eastern
Cambodia.
To seal the route totally and in rela-
tive safety by conventional means would
imply planting several US divisions in
one of the wildest jungles of Asia. The
logistic problem of maintaining so con-
siderable a force would itself be tre-
mendous. It is, therefore, understand-
able, if not quite excusable, that mili-
tary spokesmen in Saigon sometimes
prefer to lead correspondents on con-
ducted tours through the looking glass
by simultaneously boasting to them
about the effectiveness of our air at-
tacks on the Ho Chi-minh trail (which
actually seem to have had very little
effect) and wringing their hands over the
steady increase in military traffic along
the trail since the attacks began.
Yet there are various less conven-
tional solutions to the problem of the
trail which, though neither completely
effective nor wholly without risk, might
be worth considering: hit-and-run com-
mando raids on depots and staging areas,
intermittent harassment from secure
jungle bases, and air cavalry sweeps to
mention a few. By the imaginative use
of the fantastic detection devices of vari-
ous sorts available to our armed forces,
which, thanks to the techniques of air-
ground co-operation, have been raised to
a new pitch of efficiency during the Viet-
nam war, it is possible today to conceive
of long-range operations behind the
enemy lines in jungle country whose
audacity would have left a Wingate
breathless. But audacity implies risk,
and the boldest American commander,

given the present confused state of
American opinion and the irresponsible
attitude of part of the American Press,
would scarcely dare to risk even a US
battalion on an operation, however attrac-
tive strategically, that with bad luck
might turn into what some headline
writers would be likely to call an
American Dien Bien Phu.
Battling the Clock
Aur reluctance so far to move against
” the privileged Vietcong sanctuary in'
Cambodia is less excusable, for neither
the logistic nor the political difficulties
to be overcome are really serious. The
recent public announcement here that a
so-called Free Cambodian maquis was
beginning to operate in Cambodia may
indicate that at long last the problem is
being dealt with. It should be no great
problem to discover in South Vietnam a
a sufficient number of Free Cambodian
volunteers to clean out the North Viet-
namese occupation force that has estab-
lished itself in eastern Cambodia (whether
with or without the explicit permission
of Prince Sihanouk is not quite clear).
Covertly arranging maritime and fluvial
mishaps of various kinds for the osten-
sibly neutral vessels that have been
smuggling arms into both Cambodia and
South Vietnam should be even easier.
(And while we are at it, it might be
useful if the Saigon Government would
give dispensation to some freedom-loving
Montagnard rebels in the remoter fast-
nesses of North Vietnam who would
claim the same recognition at an eventual
peace conference that Hanoi demands for
the Vietcong rebels in South Vietnam.)
Both our military and political author-
ities in Vietnam—and to some extent
throughout South-east Asia—often give
the impression of lacking political realism
through failure to take time into account
as a key psychological factor in our
strategy for the war. US civilian experts
talk glibly about the need for the
American people to face a generation of
conflict in South-East Asia, and the mili-
tary experts give one the impression that
no decisive operations can be launched
before the end of the present US troop
build-up—assuming that it continues as
planned—some time next winter. By
then it seems only too likely that the
enemy will be more numerous and better
armed than he is today, and the Ameri-
can people more war-weary than they are
now—unless someone in the meantime
bas been able to offer them a realistic
a nd therefore convincing programme for
ending the struggle honorably, at an ac-
eeptable cost and within a reasonable
span.
The one task we cannot shirk in Viet-
nam is finishing the job we committed
ourselves in the eyes of Asia to com-
pete: that of effectively putting a stop to
North Vietnamese military interven-
tion in South Vietnam’s civil war. Any
betrayal of this self-imposed mission,
however camouflaged by worthless inter-
national guarantees, illusory controls, and
fallacious free determination, would irre-
trievably damage our prestige, our
honor, and even our national integrity.
If we abandon our Vietnamese allies—
for they are that, whatever their faults,
and they have been faithful in their
fashion —while they are the victims of
outside aggression, we shall never find
any others in Asia, or probably anywhere
else.
To avert such a consequence, we
should mobilise all the power necessary
to crush the enemy’s resistance and
achieve a rapid, clear-cut victory. The
longer the present looking-glass war in
South-east Asia goes on, the greater the
likelihood that it will lead either to a
catastrophic and dishonorable peace or
to a general conflagration.

LUGGAGE
HERFORDS
A CHOICE OF SIX COLOURS AT ALL LEADING STORES
Defining True
Madness
By MARK FRANKLAND
HThe affair of Valeri Tarsis, the Soviet
A writer who arrived in Britain last
week, is odd even by the standards of a
country which has always mixed its
literature with politics.
Tarsis flew into London just before the
trial began in Moscow of two other
writers, Andrei Sinyavsky and Yuri
Daniel, who, like him, have published
abroad-books highly critical of the Soviet
Union. The only difference between the
three men is that Tarsis never hid the
authorship of his books, while Sinyavsky
and Daniel wrote under pen-names. Why
should these two face trial and almost
sure conviction on the charge of slander-
ing their country while another is allowed
to go to the West where he may very
well decide to stay (Tarsis says he has
not made up his mind about this yet)?
Sinyavsky and Daniel were arrested
last September. Last May Tarsis’s “Ward
7” was published in Britain, but far from
suffering for it, he was eventually allowed
to use some of the hard currency his
books had earned him abroad. He bought
a Moskvich car and did his shopping
• in Moscow’s special shops where dollars
or sterling can buy all sorts of Western
food and consumer goods.
He began to talk freely to Western
journalists. Tarsis certainly had one great
advantage over most other Soviet critics
of the Soviet Union: his refusal to hide
or moderate his thoughts under any cir-
cumstances. He obviously opted out of
the Soviet system many years ago, al-
though he still had to live on Soviet ter-
ritory. The usual phrase for such people
is “internal emigre” and it suits Tarsis
well. Like many Russian emigres abroad,
Tarsis considers the Soviet Union an
ugly facade behind which the Russian
people continue their real existence under
God (he is a devout Russian Orthodox
Christian).
This complete rejection of the Soviet
system was his main strength because it
made him immune to all the subtle pres-
sures that can usually be put on a man,
however original he may be, to conform
to the demands of his society.
His refusal to be bound by the usual
Soviet political decencies, which are
observed even by the most critically
minded young Soviet writers, and clearly
shocking to Soviet officials, and shortly
before his first book was published in
the West he was committed to a lunatic
asylum. To the extent that the definition
of insanity is always partly social, Sovie
officialdom perhaps really did believe
it had a right to do this.


The Soviet view that Tarsis is an im-
possible character (which, from their
point of view, he undoubtedly is) may
partly explain why Tarsis was allowed
to go to the West. With the Sinyavsky
and Daniel trial approaching, and causing
more and more public protest outside
the Soviet Union, Tarsis’s release could
be calculated to confuse and distract. At
the same time Soviet officials seem to
have thought that Tarsis would soon
exasperate the West as much as he had
them, and quickly lose any value as
anti-Soviet propaganda.
A few little cunning touches were
added: Tarsis was provoked into
attacking Sinyavsky and Daniel while
he was still in Moscow and his remarks
were widely quoted in the Western Press.
Tarsis may be as odd as a dodo in
Russia, but in the West he fits into an
honorable line of extravagant artists.
Now aged 60, he is a short man with a
solid, short body and the face of a lively
rhinoceros. He is immensely talkative
and a great story-teller. He will cer-
tainly have difficulty in getting used to the
West. Although learned in European
literature and languages he has of course
never lived outside Russia. Not only are
his tastes, habits and reflexes all Russian
but Russia lies at the core of his thought
and work. Emigration is difficult for such
a man and that is why most Russian
writers, whatever their quarrels with the
Soviet regime, would never dream of
leaving their country for good. The Soviet
authorities surely had thought of all this
when they decided to let Tarsis go, and
it remains to be seen how he copes with
the difficulties ahead.
But it is still puzzling that Moscow
thought his release would seriously attract
attention for any length of time from the
Sinyavsky-Daniel trial. And it is also
possible that Tarsis, far from being dam-
aged by the West, will now produce more
books in his eloquent fashion against his
old enemy, Soviet Communism.
Beneath Nigeria’s Facade
By V. L. ALLEN
The attempted military coup d’etat
in Nigeria and the subsequent mili-
tary take-over of power has sur-
prised politicians and newspaper editors
in the West. For them, Nigeria por-
trayed an African prototype for political
democracy: stable under the rule of law;
free, with elections, opposition parties
and an unrestrained trade union move-
ment. It was the Western hope for
Africa.
People see what they want to see and
the uncritical observers of Nigeria saw
only a facade. Social democrats in
Britain wanted a measure against which
to condemn Ghana with its one-party
state. The mere bones of a democratic
constitution in Nigeria were enough for
that. The industrialists wanted to dis-
parage the attempts at central planning
and at achieving some degree of economic
equality in Tanzania, Ghana, Mali and
Guinea. The unrestrained freedom to
invest and make profits in Nigeria led
them to eulogise all its institutions. When-
ever irregularities were discovered they
ignored, or rejected or damned for
having their origin in subversive quarters.
Nothing was accepted which stained the
model of political democracy.
A military take-over, however, can-
not be ignored. That is more than a
| a *n; it is a blot. But the mechanism
or selecting, for sifting evidence to
satisfy inflexible hypotheses, still works.
e Cau se, our public opinion formulators
j, . a lmost with one voice, is tribalism.
resentment by Ibo officers at
P° itical domination by the northern
Hausas. No mention of economic and
social injustices; little mention of
political corruption. Occasionally a
trickle of criticism of the Nigerian
Government is permitted but none about
its assassinated leader, Sir Abubakar
Tafawa Balewa. In any case, behind the
criticism is an implication much sought
after by some Conservatives: this proves
that Africans are really not fit to govern
themselves.
The Western reverence for Nigeria,
the praise of its institutions has been,
by and large, a successful public relations
hoax. The image we have had foisted
on us is one that many Nigerians them-
selves reject.
The Nigerian constitution provides for
free and fair elections but there has
been no election in Nigeria which has
not been marked by large-scale intimi-
dation, by the use of what are, in effect,
private armies. In the Federal election
in December, 1964, and the Western
Region election in October, 1965, the
parties in power used their control
of administration to stifle opposition.
Opposition candidates were prevented
from taking out nomination papers by
corrupt returning officers; ballot papers
were manipulated to favor the party in
power; candidates and their supporters
were arrested and imprisoned on
trumped-up charges.
In the Northern and Western Regions
there were arson and murder. Traders
and cocoa farmers who refused to give
public support to the government had
their licences withdrawn. I saw many
of the victims myself when I was in Jos
Prison in Northern Nigeria. It was filled
to overflowing with political prisoners,
not one of whom was charged with a
political offence. It is not necessary to
repeat the allegations made about the
rigging of the Western Region election,
for the riots and protests, the burnings
and the killings, estimated by one source
at 1500, are testimony enough.
This picture of political intimidation
is superimposed on a setting of gross
economic inequality and corruption. In-
dependence has meant for most Nigerians
a transfer of power from a white minority
to a black minority, a substitution of
black capitalists for white ones. It has
removed little of the exploitation of the
colonialist days; just added another
dimension to it.
The average annual per capita income
in Nigeria is about $lOO and most
Nigerians have considerably less. About
98 per cent of the population of 55
million is engaged in farming, subsistence
farming, for the most part, and is largely
untouched by economic developments.
The standard of living of these and others
who live by selling cash crops has fallen
since the 19505, for their money incomes
have remained relatively stable while
prices have risen. The remaining two
per cent of the people is engaged in
industry, mainly as day laborers, with
incomes ranging from $ll to $2B a
month. Labor is plentiful and therefore
cheap. Capital is scarce and expensive;
real estate is expensive. Houses in the
European sector of Lagos cost more
than houses in the West End of London.
In the Lagos working-class suburbs
Nigerians can make ends meet only if
they sublet all but one of their rooms.
Beneath the facade, then, a number
of factors have made for instability. It
was only necessary for some of these
to coincide to give rise to actual dis-
ruption.
The consequences of the military take-
over will depend upon the political
acumen of the army commanders, for a
final solution can come only through
economic and social measures. If the
commanders make a transition, as Presi-
dent Nasser did, from dependence upon
military power to radical economic
policies, they may stay in power in-
definitely without reintroducing political
democratic measures. If they attempt to
maintain power as a military unit and
neglect the prime reasons for their
ascendance to power, then undoubtedly
there will be further unrest and, perhaps,
bloody and disruptive clashes against
organised labor. If they transfer political
power to the hands of those politicians
who use office to benefit themselves, as
Sir Abubakar Tafawa Balewa’s govern-
ment did, there will be a repetition of the
present situation but with more serious
consequences.

ARTS AND ENTERTAINMENT
Playwriting: No Instant Way
James Brazill said it himself: “Too
much hysterical acclaim of first
works”. Brazill is an unknown
Sydney playwright, whose work is about
to be staged for the first time. I. C. Wil-
liamson’s will produce his “Desire" Of
The Moth” in Melbourne next month
with Googie Withers and Ed Devereaux.
“I don’t think a man is a playwright
until he has had a body of drama,
several plays, accepted by the public,”
said Brazill, a 48-year-old assistant
librarian at the University of Sydney’s
Fisher Library. “There is a tendency to
expect instant dramatists like instant
coffee. Impatient writers try to take short
cuts by switching to fashionable and
attractive gimmicks like Theatre of
the Absurd. There are no short cuts
only a long, hard, steady grind.”
Brazill is a patient and dedicated man.
Over the past seven years he has written
for five hours each night after work and
on weekends at his Auburn home. He
describes his wife as a “drama widow”.
John McCallum, managing director of
J. C. Williamson’s, impressed with two
plays Brazill sent in, encouraged and
advised the author, and took an option
on the next play he submitted a
revised version of “Desire”, originally
written five years before. The setting is
an outback property, which Brazill con-
cedes could be in south-west Queensland,
but could just as well be anywhere.
Brazill said he found the universal
of good theatre in the Aristotelian
unities of time, place and action: “I
think a playwright should be fully aware
of the limitations of the particular audi-
ence and time that he is writing for.
Even such a startlingly contemporary
play as ‘Virginia Woolf was written
with the action taking place within these
limitations.
“Writers of the Theatre of the Absurd
try to reach beyond the significance of
language and meaning, in order to ex-
plore what they term an unexplored
territory meaninglessness to give
meaning. But I believe that the region
they have entered is insanity and they
are psychiatrists. I am writing for the
theatre, not a clinic.”
Tlobert Wales came to Sydney two
years ago from Walcha, in northern
NSW, to see the birth of his first staged
play, “The Grotto”, at the Independent
Theatre. He sweated in the front stalls
at rehearsals, and came to the first-night
party afterwards chewing alertly on his
pipe, a small, sensitive man with a faint
Scots burr and wide-awake blue eyes.
He had a placid, pretty wife, five child-
ren, and said he was working as a
builder's laborer.
It all seemed rather odd. Why did a
grazier want to write plays about Italians
in Woolloomooloo, for a start? It was
a pleasant change, of course, but then
why would anyone give up a 600-acre
property to be a builder’s laborer, and
with all those children to support?
“The Grotto” finished its run, wasn’t
heard of again, and for a couple of years
neither was Mr Wales. The next time
we saw him he was living in Double Bay
and owned a yacht fairly obvious signs
that he was no longer a builder’s laborer
and wearing the regulation suede
shoes of the ABC television man. More
importantly, he was awaiting the launch-
ing of another play “The Cell”, which
opens at the Independent on February
24.
“The Cell”, a drama about guilt set
in a convent, in his third three-act play
and, like his others, “The Hobby Horse”
and “The Grotto”, was launched with a
minimum of complications. “I took ‘The
Cell’ along to Peter Summerton at the
Independent and he liked it straight away,
just from reading the first act,” Wales
said. “But then I knew Peter from ‘The
Grotto’. The best play in the world won’t
get off the ground if there’s no contact
between the producer or agent and the
writer”.
His serious writing began with a short
story about prospectors, which won a
contest at the New England University.
Then came a one-act play, which won
another University prize, and was done
on the ABC, and another one-act play
which won a Queensland drama com-
petition.
Then came “The Hobby Horse”, “The
Grotto” and “The Cell”.
Although “The Cell” examines the pro-
blem of guilt “it’s always more
dramatic to have a play in a closed com-
munity, because the tensions work inward
instead of being directed outward over
a wide field” he still feels he hasn’t
finally come to grips with the problem,
and has another play on the same theme
put away to work on later.
He chose the nuns’ story after read-
ing about a fairly similar situation in a
Queensland convent, although he is not
a Catholic and Peter Summerton, who
is, has had busy evenings calling in nuns

PERTH FESTIVAL
Swaggering Start
rjIHE Festival of Perth in the past two
* years has emerged from hesitancy to
assurance so, in discussing the> festival
this year, there is no need to protect an
easily-bruised immaturity. The festival
has grown up enough to mis-
takes and learn by them. As it gets under
way this year it is obvious mistakes
have been made at both ends of the
scale in an over-ambitious choice of
music that has pleased only the devotees,
and in a peculiar timidity in using the
New Fortune Theatre, which should be
allowed to fulfil its potential and be the
festival focal point. Instead, the early
focus has been on Son et Lumiere , not
a strong enough peg to carry the burden.
But despite such criticisms, there is no
doubt that the festival has started out
with a swagger of success and little risk
of this confidence not being justified.
The first wave of audience was high
particularly to the films, so important to
commercial success and advance
bookings are good, with some of the best
attractions yet to come. The Elizabeth-
an Theatre Trust people are rubbing
their hands over holidaying Perth chil-
dren’s enthusiasm for the Tintookies
(only Sydney’s Phillip gave them a bet-
ter season); bookings for “Porgy and
Bess” are on a par with the Adelaide
Festival's; and the heavyweight Athens
Drama Company is attracting a pleasing
early response.
“Romeo and Juliet”, opening the festi-
val at the New Fortune, was a joy. The
open-air Elizabethan replica is fulfilling
its promise as an exciting place to re-
discover a dynamic Shakespeare, despite
its acoustical drawbacks on a windy
night. If we compare Shakespear£ wdth
religion (so many do!) then producer
Edgar Metcalfe, through the New For-
tune's reformation, has stripped away
the dogma to give the audience the real
story. This lack of adornment is point-
ed up by the contrast of James Beattie’s
Mercutio urbanely risque, the scene-
stealing poet slightly removed from the
real people. As Romeo, young Sydney
actor Peter Rowley was neither hand-
some nor athletic enough to sustain his
demanding role convincingly, at least to
a male critic’s eye. Yet he captured
completely the exquisite agony of young
love.
Son et Lumiere was the other main
dramatic event early in the festival
the pageant of light and sound set
against one of the State's few old build-
ings. According to Son et Lumiere con-
noisseurs, this was brighter than the
European presentations on which it was
patterned. Certainly the novelty is an
attraction, although the test will be
whether or not the first contingent of
audiences recommend it.
Musically, the Festival of Perth has
been bold, earning the commendation of
Sir Arthur Bliss, Master of the Queen's
Musick, for putting on one of the best
programmes of 20 - century British
music that has been heard. Whether it
was because the early programmes were
performed in the Winthrop Ha 11... not
the best on hot nights ... or because
they were too avant garde, they were
appreciated only by dedicated music-

THEATRE
Frivolous
The Cavern. Jean Anouilh. Director, Irene
Mitchell. St Martin’s Theatre, Melbourne.
Cages. Lewis John Carlino. Director, Wal
Cherry. Emerald Hill, Melbourne.
A few years ago Henri Clouzot made
a remarkable film of Picasso at
work, in which the great man sat at his
easel and tossed off a score of while-you-
wait masterpieces. In a few bold lines
he’d outline a matador on the horns of
a bull, and then proceed to play with
the composition, the forms, the colors —
the work undergoing a series of trans-
formations in what was unashamedly a
genius’s vaudeville act An enthralling
virtuoso performance, it sadly confirmed
John Berger’s judgment: that lacking a
theme commensurate with his awesome
technical ability, Picasso had elected to
become a conjuror.
Like Anouilh. Surely the most facile
and elegant of dramatists, he insists on
remaining essentially frivolous. Within
“The Cavern” is a truly powerful study
of poverty. In the second act a pregnant
kitchen maid delivers a tirade on her
fate with venom that stuns the theatre.
Yet Anouilh, who comperes the pro-
ceedings, coyly interrupts and ridicules
this brilliant scene as he does at crucial
moments throughout the play. He refuses
to allow it to gain momentum, and insists
that we applaud his theatrical leger-
demain rather than respond to the
drama itself.
The plot concerns the murder of a
cook in a turn-of-the-century French
mansion. Upstairs, the count, her lover
of yesteryear, delivers mock-profound
sermons on the responsibilities of his
class, while below in the cavern the
servants live their drab and brutish lives.
Anouilh arranges his scenes in dramatic
rather than chronological order, flashing
back and forth as it suits him. The tech-
nique serves to emphasise Anouilh’s
point: that he is a master of his medium,
and can manipulate his audience as easily
as his cast. What a pity for him and
ourselves that he has no “Guernica”
behind him.
Irene Mitchell’s production is assured
and the cast is good. Two members
deserve special commendation. Marcella
Burgoyne makes a fine job of the cook,
Marie Jeanne, and Anne Charleston is
splendid as Adele.
Carlino’s “Cages” are two one-act plays
for two actors. The first is a straight-
forward piece in which a young man
visits a somewhat dilapidated prostitute
and insists that she break down his
inhibitions by re-enacting his first meet-
ing with a lost love. Feeling that this
denial of her own personality is the final
humiliation, the prostitute rebels. Finally,
compassionately, the young man re-
enacts her own precious love scene.
The second play is pop - lonesco
and for the first 20 minutes hilariously
inexplicable. A man in a modern apart-
ment practises chicken clucks and crows,
and reads aloud from a text book about
the need to “cull out non-layers for
increased profitability”. His wife arrives
and the two engage in various small
battles for supremacy, using children’s
games. Slowly the goings-on are clarified.
He is an ornithologist, she an advertising
copywriter. She suspects him of homo-
sexual inclinations and has gradually
assumed domestic dominance. He has
been studying the history of the chicken
and he is preparing himself for
“Epiphany” when he’ll become a roost-
ruling Rooster. He dons his stainless-
steel beak (designed to ensure peck domin-
ance) and mounts his roost, all sexual
certainty replaced by magnificent pride
in his new-found Roosterhood. And then,
tragically, he lays an egg. A very, very
funny play. Beautifully acted by Brian
Young and Eileen Chapman.

summer theatrical drought has
been broken by J. C. Williamson’s
with a lively production of “The Boys
from Syracuse”, which must be just what
the party-bocking agent ordered. “Syra-
cuse” has to balance against its age (28
is, apparently superannuated for a musi-
cal) a generous ration of known, pleas-
ant songs, a good book by George
Abbott, derived from Plautus and Shake-
speare, and with some lines in the un-
abashedly corny, wisecracking style of
the American ’thirties, which with age
acquire a charm all their own.
This musical, with its two sets of twins
and two leading ladies, is essentially one
for teamwork rather than a grand star.
This cast for the benefit of chauvin-
ists, an all-Australian one pulled to-
gether very well. There were only one
or two spots when it was apparent to the
audience that some fairly close in-fight-
ing was going on behind the footlights
to emerge as star.
Most of the time producer Christo-
pher Hewett and choreographer Betty
Pounder kept things going too briskly to
give anyone much time to manoeuvre.
Brian Hannan (at the cost on opening
night of a broken arm) and James Ken-
ney were two gadfly Dromios, Nancye
Hayes an effervescent Luce and Alton
Harvey a snappy sorcerer.
The Tivoli has built its new variety
programme around the generous bulk
of British comedian Jimmy Edwards.
Mr Edwards tosses off his act with an
agreeable nonchalance, and, incidentally,
is generous enough to open the bill
rather than leaving it to others to warm
up the audience for him. He gets fair
competition from another Englishman,
Peter Maxwell, who does clever things
at a piano and with his own voice, sing-
ing male and female almost, but not
quite, simultaneously. Between them


they restore your faith in good old dirty
_but not too dirty English humor
which we thought had been flung out
the window when satire stalked in.

Short Run
t\r Richard Kimble has found his one-
” armed man, who nodded an admission
that he had murdered Kimble’s wife,
and died. But I doubt that is the end of
“The Fugitive” although David Janssen,
as the non-stop medico, has been in
action for tw'o seasons. Whatever Dr
Kimble’s intentions are, another distance
runner now has his hand on the baton
and is trying to wrest it from him. The
new athlete is Ben Gazzara, as Paul
Bryan, a man whose remaining life span
has been set by doctors at one to two
years, a conveniently elastic prognosis.
Kimble, with a murder conviction, has
to limit his running to the United States,
so the conflicts in “The Fugitive” have to
occur within the USA and involve some
fairly ugly citizens, as well as some more
kindly disposed.
Paul Bryan, unfortunately, has no
limitations. His immediate reaction to the
fatal diagnosis is, “Run for your life”,
or pack a host of wild adventures into
the life that remains. For openers, he
saw what I took to be the finish of the
Monte Carlo Rally, and agreed to navi-
gate for a driver going to work behind the
Iron Curtain, in what I took to be
Budapest, Warsaw or Belgrade.
Bryan went to a cafe with some local
friends, and one proposed a toast to
“workers’ republics everywhere”. Bryan
called for a counter toast to “freedom and
democracy everywhere”. The other man
refused to drink to it. One of his friends
told him it would be polite to respond.
He walked away and told the police.
They arrested the man wffio had put
politeness above ideology, and he was
gaoled for eight years.
Instead of regretting that he had
opened his big mouth so disastrously in
the wrong place, Bryan saw the whole
affair as the fault of Communist authori-
ties. His consul told him to leave the
country, fast. Bryan remained to involve
the prisoner’s sister and a former Resis-
tance hero in a plot to free the man.
All this nonsense involved a waste of
such actors as Ben Gazzara, Gia Scala,
Telly Savalas, Jeremy Slate and Hans
Gudegast.
I had never expected to plead for the
further adventures of Richard Kimble,
hut the running doctor’s portrayal of an
av erage American is so much preferable
to his competition’s that 1 wdsh him long
hfe, and Paul Bryan a very short run.
FRANK ROBERTS
ON FILMS
Big Man, Big Industry
Oeymour Poe, vice-president of 20th
Century-Fox and right-hand man to
Darryl F. Zanuck: the phrase rolls nicely
off the tongue, and it seemed foolish to
pass by the chance of meeting him on his
recent visit to Sydney. He said, first of
all, that he planned to have a number of
Australian theatres converted into “multi-
purpose houses”; that is to say, they
would be able to accommodate all the
screen ratios from Cinerama down to the
small screen. “And the theatres we en-
visage will be smaller. The age of the
movie palace is over.”
Wasn't there a danger that there might
be too few seats in the new-style theatres
for profits to be made? “We feel that
there are never too many seats if you
have 800 to 1000, but 600 would be too
few.” So it’s fairly safe to say that the
bigger Hoyts theatres here would gradu-
ally be converted to smaller, more luxu-
rious places with 800 to 1000.
I was surprised to hear Mr Poe’s
mention of Cinerama. Wasn’t that on
the way out? “It did show a decline for
a period. But they have eliminated the
three-panel system, and a new Cinerama
picture—‘The Battle of the Bulge’
is packing them in. The new ‘Khartoum’
is another spectacle on Cinerama pro-
cess.”
Blockbusters were still the only really
safe bet for the studios? “Well, let me
say that »a 10-million-dollar investment
is less dangerous than a five-million-dollar
investment. There are the lucky excep-
tions — ‘Zorba the Greek’ became a huge
hit on the strength of its music outside
the United States and because of its fan-
tastic performances within the United
States. It cost 800,000 dollars to make
and it will take a six-million-dollar gross.
“But then you have to remember that
‘The Third Secret’ and ‘Guns of Batasi,’
two other smaller-budget pictures we
made, didn't do well.”
I asked Mr Poe if he agreed with some
of the top executives I met in Hollywood
who had wanted to be rid of stars, and
doubted their “pull” anyway. “I’d like to
know how they would succeed without
them. There are 10 or 12 stars in Holly-
wood who can command a million dollars
advance on a picture. No, they don’t
guarantee a picture’s success. Nothing
can do that. But they will be a most
important part of a picture’s box-office
potential.” And Mr Poe agreed with me
that most people still went to films to
see certain stars.
This year would see a line-up of films
with top stars and “big”, colorful subjects:
“Bloomer Girl”, with Shirley MacLaine,
directed by George Cukor from the
Broadway musical; “Dr Dolittle”, from
Hugh Lofting’s children’s books, to be
directed by Richard Fleischer and starring
Rex Harrison; the life of Gertrude Law-
rence, with Julie Andrews; and perhaps
in 1967, the long-delayed Australian
project, “Big Country, Big Man,” from
the script by Darcy Niland.
The formula was complete. And did Mr
Poe see any hope for Australian films to
be made here? “Certainly. But it’s no
good talking about low-budget pictures.
First of all, you get something going like
the British Eady plan” (a scheme where-
by money is levied on theatre seat sales
and ploughed into a local industry). “No,
that wouldn’t affect us at all—just .001
p.c. And it would be enough to finance
studio and shooting. And your govern-
ment wouldn’t have to pay anything—-
they only have to approve the scheme, to
make a move . . .
“Then you go to a top American pic-
ture company. You say: you supply the
female star, say, Lizzie Glutz, the male
star, the director. We will pay for the
physical production. We, Australia, will
keep the Eastern hemisphere, you, the
Hollywood studio, will keep the Western
hemisphere market. That way you split
the world market territorially. Low-bud-
get, purely indigenous films would never
see the light of day. Your players are
almost amateurs, you can’t register in
this area.” But co-productions, on the
lines suggested, would be the answer;
the scheme had, Mr Poe pointed out,
already worked in Italy.
Mr M. Silverstein, head of MGM
International, who was here at the same
time as Mr Poe, concurred. But he added
that a good script would have to be
forthcoming from an Australian writer.
“But it’s no good trying to have a sophis-
ticated subject for a story that could
more easily be laid in New York, London
or Paris. It would have to offer purely
Australian coloring—set in the opal fields
or in the oil fields perhaps.”
And what, I asked Mr Poe, about the
future of the American film industry?
More and more blockbusters, obviously,
but what about TV? Wasn't there the
problem that the blockbusters —the only
more or less sure-fire money-spinners
these days—would look hopeless on the
tiny screen? “We’ll have to think in terms
of plays. A fantastic play with a fan-
tastic star. Shown only for one night.”
But that wouldn’t be a film, would it?
“It would be a filmed play.” Mr Poe
concluded firmly.

BOOKS
The Ugly Duckling
BY JAMES McAULEY
The Wild Swan. Monica Stirling. Collins.
T^ 5 ' 15,
here is still some reluctance to ack-
nowledge that Hans Christian Ander-
sen was one of the great imaginative
geniuses of the nineteenth century. His
claim rests on a mere handful of his
numerous stories for children, which have
never been merely for children. The
Emperor’s New Clothes, the Snow Queen,
the Ugly Duckling, the Emperor’s Night-
ingale, the Wild Swans and the Little
Mermaid belong to that realm of true
fantasy which begins with myth and folk-
tale, and in which Andersen has the
same free rights as Shakespeare and
Spenser and Chaucer. The charge of senti-
mentality which has been levelled at him
falls defeated by the enduring appeal of
his best creations.
When Andersen wrote his autobiog-
raphy he began, “My life is a fairy tale”,
and Monica Stirling’s account of his youth
and rise to fame is sensitive to this. He
was the son of a poor cobbler, a loving
but unbalanced father, and of a washer-
woman, who was an illegitimate child
and who had already borne an illegitimate
daughter, who became a prostitute. The
parents tried hard in poverty to do their
best for the boy, giving him love and
unusual freedom. He was tall, thin, and
awkward, prone to nervous fits, a dream-
mg child with a kind of magical inno-
cence that enabled him to pass through
sordid and potentially destructive experi-
ences undefiled, though not without
dreadful suffering, and to win the hearts
of the kindly well-wishers who came to
his aid at critical moments of his early
life,
, 1 ourt^en he left home to try his
ortune in Copenhagen. He attracted the
s y m P a t etic interest of people who re-
co S msed his unusual qualities, but his
attempts to become a dancer, a singer, an
f Ct °, r , a ai J ec *’. anc * he endured much
ardship and disappointment. At length
was awart^ at seventeen, a royal
g rant which enabled him to go to gram-
rr'ar sc h° o h where he did well in spite
a PP a 'hng experiences at the hands of
a sarc astic, bullying rector who seemed
ent on breaking his spirit. He then en-
feret* the university at Copenhagen. His
father had died years before, and his
mother, after a second marriage, sank
under her troubles and became an
alcoholic. Andersen treated her with
tenderness, and gave as much help as his
straitened means allowed,
The urge to write became so strong
that he gave up his university course,
His poetry won him recognition but little
money. It was not until he was thirty
that he wrote the first of his children’s
tales, not at first recognising that these,
HANS ANDERSEN
and not the novels and plays he also
wrote, were to be his great achievement.
Andersen never married. After two
youthful, unrequited passions he met the
great love of his life, the Swedish singer
Jenny Lind. Her story was also a strange
one, in some ways not unlike his. She
could not return his passion, and herself
remained unmarried.
Up to this point, Monica Stirling holds
the willing reader. It is, perhaps, not her
fault that the later part of the story flags.
The ugly duckling has become a swan,
universally admired, able to travel widely
and meet the great and famous of his
day Heine, Schumann, Mendelssohn,
Dickens, the Brownings, Henry James,
and so on, as well as many of the crowned
heads and nobility of Europe. He was still
a strange and nervous swan, with the
hypochondriac fears and neurotic ob-
sessions which were the legacy of his
heredity and his early trials. One sees
less, however, of the inner life of Ander-
sen in these later pages, and the contacts
with the great and famous, though in-
teresting in many details, form an after-
math of secondary value.
Andersen was intuitively a religious
man, with a deep trust in God; but he
accepted from his father, and retained,
a lack of belief in the Christian story.
In him was enacted the nineteenth-cen-
tury experience whereby, as the Christian
story lost its hold on men’s minds, a
hunger was quickened for make-believe
embodiments of the same promises, ex-
pressed openly in literature through
“mythic” creations, or covertly or uncon-
sciously in -fictions of a more realistic
sort. Andersen’s way was to write out
of the child’s heart which he retained,
but with a wistfulness whose meaning the
adult alone fully understands. It is this
wistfulness which has been accused of
sentimentality. But Andersen wanted to
say that, without the nightingale’s song,
man the emperor is the prey of death
and despair, and he said it without the
tough disguises which are often far more
truly sentimental.
Routine
Today was a hard one at the office.
The secretary, who always seems so shy
And never starts a conversation, wore
a skin-tight glass dress.
Nobody seemed to notice, so I asked.
Yes, it s true, she said, touch it and see."
Forcing that serene objective smile
I used when addressing superiors,
I tapped her arm with my fingernail.
A silver crack appeared
As in ice* Don t worry, she s<nd 9 dud
returned to her typewriter.
By noon the crack had spread up her
shoulder
,To her neck below the ear, and down past
her elbow
Where it branched out, like on a map,
m rivulets.
She strained hard not to turn her head.
Ihen, below her left breast, I noticed
A dark spot, like a bee-bee hole,
and I was anxious.

I began to chip and peel away the glass,
Getting better at it as I went along,
becoming, I might say,
Really quite adept, though in some places
Innate modesty impeded my work.
When I finished, I discovered she was
completely dressed
In a ski outfit. “Why?” I asked.
“I’m planning a vacation,” she said.
By then I was curious and had lost much
of my reserve^
So I carried her to the supply room
Where I stripped away a mink coat, a
raccoon coat
Two cashmere sweaters, three dresses, a
blouse
With a round collar and a butterfly pin

But when at last I reached her under-
clothes,
She sniffled and whimpered. “Haven’t you
gone too far! ”
Naturally, I felt ashamed, so I folded her
Into a manila envelope, and mailed her,
with no return address,
To the office manager of a competing firm.

The Bottle Imp
By IAN CROSS
Confessions of an Irish Rebel. Brendan
Behan. Hutchinson. $3.85.
My Brother Brendan. Dominic Behan.
Leslie Frewin. $3.15.
Brendan Behan had been a member
of the young IRA at the age of
six, did his first stretch in an English
gaol by the time he was 16, was out after
two years, but soon in trouble again and
shouting “God Save Ireland” and “Up
the Republic” to an English court before
being sentenced to fourteen years’ penal
servitude for attempted murder and il-
legal possession of firearms. But, in Paris
in the 1950 s that was behind him. He
was a writer, a success, and his play,
“The Hostage”, was acclaimed at an in-
ternational festival. The French Govern-
ment was putting on a fuss. They
gave him a car but no sooner had he
settled into it when, Jesus, Mary and
Joseph, didn’t he notice the Union Jack
fluttering on one side of the car?
“In the name of the Blessed Virgin
Mary, would you mind telling me the
meaning of the Union Jack? Why have
we got this disgusting rag on the car?”
“Your play is representing Great
Britain,” his guide told him.
“I’d forgotten that,” said Brendan
Behan. “Stick up another Union Jack
and I might get a bit more trade.”
His last book, “Confessions of an
Irish Rebel”, was recorded on tape by
Behan in New York, when he was a
dying man, and edited by Rae Jeffs,
who describes herself as “a public rela-
tions officer” and “a publicity manager”
in a foreword explaining that she had to
produce the finished manuscript without
his help. Brendan was dead.
It is wonderful when a writer can soar
to the heights in language sprinkled with
obstreperous crudities which can be
savored as earthy and robust, and send
“The Times Literary Supplement” into
superlatives about “exuberant, ungovern-
®d and indeed ungovernable” writing;
hut when the writer is exhausted and
sick, and his style becomes an edited
imitation and mockery of itself, the
heights are a long way away. But, thank
God, “Confessions” does become worth-
while after the first chapter, and Rae
leffs’ efforts are justified, even if the
hook is nothing more than the yarns of
a man who liked to think of himself
as the greatest talker since Oscar Wilde,
a drunken, singing slob of a man, who
Was also compassionate, gloriously in-
Doce nt and a genius.
Nobody can blame success for Behan’s
he was indulging in them long
Wore he was famous. In Paris, after his
KA days were over, he casually dis-
-oses that he was a writer of pornog-
raphy and a pimp. Later, when they
fussed over him in Paris (with that Union
Jack fluttering before him), the French
Ministry of Culture staged a reception
at his old bar, and were astonished
when Behan was recognised by the
management and staff.
“Sure, we know him,” they were told.
“He used to work over there, in the
comer by the telephone.”
As for drinking: clearly Behan would
rather do that than practically anything
else, except perhaps
singing (he had a
very pleasant tenor
voice). In Paris
again, trying out
leeches as a cure for
a black eye, he
found that as soon
as each leech gorged
on the Behan blood,
it dropped to the
floor, dead.
He saw himself as
a rebel, and certainly
made noises like one,
especially against in-
stitutions, groups,
religious hypocrisy.
Behan only bothered
to take positive
action against anybody or any institution
lacking, or seeming to lack, respect for
the individual man for being without
love, if you like. Given a sign of love,
Behan would forgive any man his sins
and for this screws, cops, Englishmen,
Orangemen, rapists, murderers get a
good word, sometimes naive, sometimes
passionate, in his “Confessions”. As for
his more sweeping generalisations, such
as the one quoted, he told a friend that,
on occasion, he didn’t know what he
meant “but I had to say something to
the bastards”.
As for the business of loving of
course, he practised what he was too
self-conscious to preach. While pawning
his typewriter for three quid he noticed
a shabbily dressed young woman getting
her ticket and a ten-shilling note from
the pawnbroker for a bundle of clothes.
Outside, he saw the same woman, now
with two young children. He pressed his
three single notes into the woman’s hand
and fled. He herded twelve frozen Dub-
liners into a tailor’s one cold Christmas
and ordered a dozen overcoats. It is said
that he saved countless people from
being evicted by paying their rent.
He was typically Irish in his reverence
for his mother, and regarded his mar-
riage as a kind of disloyalty to her. His
BRENDAN BEHAN
wedding party was
attended by his
mother under the
impression, which he
was careful to give
her, that this was
simply a bit of a
bash at the corner
pub. Afterwards,
brother Dominic
told her that the
party was, in fact,
for Brendan's wed-
ding, and when she
next saw her son she
asked him, “Bren-
dan, is it true you’re
married?” Where-
upon, that broken-
nosed IRA member,
ex-gunman, gaolbird, broke into tears,
clasped her in his arms and said, “Mother,
don’t you know I’ll never love anyone
the way I love you?”
“My Brother Brendan”, by Dominic
Behan, is an unsatisfactory book because
he restricts himself mainly to his per-
sonal impressions of Brendan in the de-
fensive manner of a boy measuring him-
self against his bigger brother. “Living
in Ireland, my trouble was that nobody
ever spoke to me at all, and, although
it may be terrible to be ignored, to be
ignored as somebody’s brother is, I as-
sure you, ten times worse.” Of Brendan’s
behavior during the London perform-
Drought Stream
You and I and the dragonflies,
Crooked as stones by the still, brown pools,
In the drought spring sun, wandering,
Watching a tiny weed flickering, a thread
Of current still springing even as the
drought clamps down.
You, my six-years son, and I
Your father of forty-three,
You the spring rain that came at the end
Of fourteen drought-long years.
One dragonfly, with tiger-striped fuselage
Flying tail-high like a helicopter
Whirrs his four wings over our four feet,
And we too brush the cheek of the water,
Walk unconfined in drought spring air.
There will be deaths of grass and blood,
The liquid skin of mud will crack like
stone.
And even if the season break, the dragonfly
will die.
M y six-year-old boy, son of the drought,
you run over the rocks
Do not trip, do not fall.
“Come on! Come on!”
I will follow, wherever you call.

the stage in the middle of a perform-
ance. Dominic’s book is anecdotal: he
conveys the warmth and boisterousness
of tne Behan family life, but only some-
thing of the tragedy of the decline of
the drunken, diabetic Brendan.
Brendan Behan insisted that he was
a writer and nobody in his right
mind could deny that and yet, after
a couple of good plays and a good book,
he never again did any serious literary
work. He failed to fulfil contracts, and
his publishers finally resorted to the
tape-recorder and an editor to act as a
literary midwife in order to concoct
books “by” Brendan Behan. He had an
incredible talent, but not the discipline
for writing. But literary critics who talk
about unfulfilled genius overlook the
fact that his genius was being what he
was, that there are other ways to fulfil
gifts his whole life, the talking,
boozing, roistering, fighting, singing and
loving, was an epic performance. And if
he did not leave a master-work behind
him, we should remember Dominic’s
words on Brendan, the man, and the
people who loved him: “They remem-
bered a man who walked into their lives,
bought a round of drinks, sang a song
or two, and left them with hope.”

tralia. 1960-1921. lan Turner. Australian

A ustralian Labor history has been a
mixed brew. Mostly healthy, heady
stuff, it has not escaped some souring
from its dregs—and that, occasionally,
within the writings of the same author.
At its less reputable fringes—particularly
those committed to the more enervating
puerilities of Marxism—there has been
a tendency towards degeneration into a
debilitated cultist mythology. This cult, at
its worst, has been obsessive, ill-informed
and intolerant: its art-form has been
heroic chronicle, its language an indul-
gent litany of self-praise and self-accus-
ation. A Labor movement dedicated to
the service of humanity has suffered
much, here as elsewhere, from Cyclopean
chroniclers whose real heroes are non-
human —abstractions, theories and gener-
alities. The tendency towards sterility
has been most evident among Left-wing
amateurs, but it has not been entirely
absent from the work of some academic
practitioners. On the other hand, the best
work of other and, sometimes, these same
historians shows clearly that theoretical
commitment can illumine, not obfuscate.
Dr Turner’s academic examination of
some industrial and~political aspects of
the Labor movement 1900-1921 appears
to be informed by socialist doctrinal
preconceptions: from time to time the
movement is weighed in the balance of
Marxism and Leninism. No one who has
read, say, Trotsky’s history can grumble
at that.
Yet, bearing in mind the techniques
not only of Trotsky’s masterpiece but of
less rigorous theorists, it might be ex-
pected that these preconceptions had
been exposed to other, differing or con-
trary preconceptions. And that these other
views would be, if not evaluated in the
text, at least cited in the bibliography.
But even the bibliography is largely in-
nocent of the considerable crop of schol-
arly work, published and in thesis form,
which offers interpretations other than
Dr Turner’s. Primary source material
seems to have suffered the same neglect.
One of Dr Turner’s main themes is the
history of the IWW. There is no in-
dication that he has consulted, or sought
to consult, the very considerable amount
of IWW material, much of police con-
fiscations, in Commonwealth and State
archives. Nor is there reference to the
Sydney IWW trial transcript, judge’s
notebooks or Law Reports. And what of
the available personal papers of men who
play a part in the narrative —say, Ross,
Black, Catts, Boote, to mention a few?
And the records of Labor’s opponents,
economic and political? The declared
materials on which this book is based are,
appropriately enough, mainly Labor and
socialist, but narrowly so; and even there
the coverage is partial. There are no less
than eight eastern State Labor movement
newspapers of Dr Turner’s period not
cited in his bibliography. There is little in
the range and depth of this bibliography
to inspire confidence that reasonable in-
surance has been taken out against the
dangers of narrow polemic.
The dimensions of this book’s vision
are apparent, too, in the lapses which
occur on the periphery of its own im-
mediate field. The Archbishop of Sydney
in 1916 was Kelly, not Carr (p. 115);
Carr was Archbishop of Melbourne. The
Waihi strike was not in coal-mining
(p. 123) but in gold-quartz—and in any
case it was not from it, but from the 1913
waterside strike that Tom Barker came
to Australia. The description of the
attitude to Home Rule of “fervent Irish
patriots” (p. 69) and the application of
Australian generalisations to New Zealand
Labor (p. 17) suggest little knowledge of
these matters.
In these circumstances, many of the
general assessments and conclusions ad-
vanced are both predictable, and, given
the present state of scholarship, difficult
to accept—particularly as they often are
proffered so badly. Thus: “In Australia
it was the new mass unions of the un-
skilled, influenced by socialists within
their ranks which moved for the for-
mation of a mass working-class party”
(p. xlx). Deprived of even mention, are
other interpretations of the origins and
nature of the ALP to confess themselves
casualties to this assertion?
Or to take the considerable section on
the IWW trials of 1916. This reiterates
the traditional Labor legend of martyr-
dom: it is untroubled by the weaknesses
and inconsistencies in the case those
who defended the IWW, by legal concepts
and procedures, by the arguments of
Royal Commissioners, by alternative ex-
planations. Given that a Royal Com-
missioner found otherwise, a reader needs
more than a bare assertion that “the
evidence against them [the police] was
overwhelming” (p. 137). Nor is there
serious, balanced consideration of how
the IWW, a “serious revolutionary organ-
isation”, “no longer a challenge that could
be ignored” impinged on the then existing
concept of the State.
The same tendency to ignore com-
plexity and impose non-existent preci-
sions is apparent in the treatment of the
origins of the Communist Party and the
adoption of the 1921 Socialisation Ob-
jective. Indeed, the emphasis of the book
is not so much on investigation aim
argument as on exposition.
There is, of course, a good deal of use-
ful information in this book. However,
in terms of technique, historiographers
of the future may be tempted to check
He Who Plants a Tree
He who plants a tree
And hopes to taste sweet fruits and flowers
Should choose most carefully
A sharp soil sours.
Roots may probe too deep
And, touching springs of bitterness,
None but t.ie strongest keep
Their suppleness.
Tears at the heart of things
Make bitter drinking for the rose:
Alone the harsh sedge springs
Where salt wind blows.
Lone, unlovely, free,
Suck still your bitter, secret powers:
Leave prudent husbandry
To other flowers.
B. A. MOORE

Frost and Fire
By VIVIAN SMITH
Selected Letters of Robert Frost. Edited by
Lawrance Thompson. Jonathan Cape. $9.80.
The Strings Are False. Louis MacNeice.
Faber and Faber. $5.15.
Robert Frost and Louis MacNeice
both died in 1963 the one a
feted, grand old man of letters; the other
in mid-career and at a new phase of his
poetic development. They had little in
common beyond devotion to their craft
and the fact that they became popular
poets, caught up in the public events of
their day. Both were important writers
and in the future their lives will be
written. And both have left behind them
books which their biographers will find in-
dispensable: the one a collection of letters,
the other an early autobiographical
fragment.
Frost has always seemed such an
openly simple and direct soul that one
should have suspected there was some-
thing devious in his make-up. He cer-
tainly emerges from his letters a richer
and perhaps darker figure than one
might have imagined. “Inconsistencies,
contradictions and concealments” are
apparent throughout his life. His editor,
who knew him well, states that Frost
lacked confidence. And yet what also
emerges from this book is a sense of
great conviction. Frost may not have
been certain of the final value of his
work or of the reliability of his
audience or of how much time the Muse
would give him (how could he have
been?) but he knew unshakeably what
and how he wanted to write.
From his earliest days, he declared he
wanted “the unmade words to work with,
not the familiar made ones that every-
body exclaims Poetry”. He saw that “the
great fight of any poe( is against the
people who want him to write in a
special language that has gradually
separated from spoken language”. Frost
remained faithful to his few early
principles and if they sometimes resulted
in flatness, dryness and banality, he
realised this was the cost of directness,
quietness and simplicity. In art every-
thing has to be paid for.
But even though this selection contains
some important and moving letters on
Frost’s attitudes to his poetry, it is likely
to prove most rewarding as a picture of
Frost the man and of the times he lived
through, rather than of Frost the expli-
cator and theoriser.
Frost had pursued the art of poetry
with quiet dedication and without suc-
cess until he moved to England in 1912
and there met the important figures of
the day: Flint, Pound, Yeats, Gibson and
Edward Thomas who was to become his
close friend and whose poetic develop-
ment he was to influence so deeply.
England brought him recognition and,
in time, fame.
Many letters record his conflicts and
quarrels—especially with Pound (whom
he was later to help find freedom during
the famous Pound case of 1957-58),
Bernard de Voto, and various book
collectors and academics. After his
return to America in 1915, Frost estab-
lished contact with the universities and
became the poet-on-campus at Amherst
and elsewhere for the rest of his life.
If Frost’s first forty years are the
lonely years of isolation and consolida-
tion, his last forty years are those of the
celebrated, feted, conservative public
sage. They are also the years of great
private suffering and grief. Not the least
of the merits of this remarkable book is
the background picture it gives of the
development of the American literary
scene over the last sixty years.
Louis MacNeice’s “The Strings Are
False” is an altogether lighter work. It
was still incomplete in 1941 when it was
left in safe keeping with E. R. Dodds
and it is now published with a personal
memoir by John Hilton of MacNeice at
Marlborough and Oxford. Where Frost
is an example of “the egotistical sub-
lime”, MacNeice is a case of “negative
capability”: for all his honesty, frank-
ness and directness, his personality re-
mains elusive.
Son of an Irish Protestant bishop,
MacNeice spent his childhood in an
Ulster rectory and, before going to Marl-
borough, went to a school run by Little-
ton Powys, one of the famous Powys
brothers. MacNeice’s Oxford in the
’twenties is very like Evelyn Waugh’s
and while he has nothing to say of Auden
that one hasn’t read elsewhere, his book
is notable for its glimpses of Yeats,
Machado and John Betjeman, to mention
only a few names. After leaving Oxford
MacNeice took up a lectureship in Greek
at Birmingham which he resigned after
the break-up of his marriage. The auto-
biobraphy leaves him returning to Eng-
land on the outbreak of war after a
lecture tour in America.
MacNeice was the least political of
the ’3os poets and this fragmentary
autobiography perhaps helps us to under-
stand why. His intense political scepti-
cism and his absence of any sense of
guilt either about his social position and
background or his personality and,
above all, his abiding feeling that there
were and are no simple answers keep
him clear of political extremes. MacNeice
was the finest English poet of the ’3os
after Auden and this autobiography
fragmentary as it is—gives a particularly
honest and clear image of his life to the
age of 32 or 33.

BUSINESS AND FINANCE
Drought Wont Break Us
TT’S bad luck, but the fall of $368 million (£lB4 million) in farm income forecast
for 1965-66 will not send us broke by any means.
Serious as the fall is, it will not really
have any significant impact on the overall
level of liquidity in Australia, no matter
what the theorists may say. This is
despite the fact that gross rural income
has almost kept pace with industrial
production in the last five years and still
makes up about 18 p.c. of Australia’s
gross national product.
The internal economic problems pre-
sented by ups and downs in the flow of
funds of this magnitude can be dealt
with pretty well these days without allow-
ing the economy to bounce around by
anything like the same magnitude. The
only serious effects on overall internal
activity the latest fall could have would
be indirect, through the balance of pay-
ments; if the Government got so con-
cerned about the level of Australia’s over-
seas reserves through the fail in rural
exports [expected to be down $2OO
million (£lOO million) for 1965-66]
that it decided to dampen the economy’s
import demand by a general policy of
restraint.
How can the economy simply do with-
out $368 million of rural incomes with-
out it making some dent? There are
plenty of reasons. In the first place,
although there is an obvious and direct
impact on bank deposits as farmers have
less money to put in the banks, this no
longer means, as a natural consequence
that the banks would therefore have less
money to lend. The level of bank lend-
ing is wrapped up with far more con-
siderations take the statutory reserve
deposits with the Reserve Bank, for
example.
If the Reserve Bank wants to allow
banks to lend more it can simply release
some of the $6OO-million-odd of the
banks’ funds frozen in these SRD s
Movements in Central Bank policy
probably play a' far more important
role in determining the level of bank
advances than even such swings in farm
income as are forecast for the current
year.
Only a proportion of the latest drop
in farm incomes would be directly re-
flected in bank deposits anyway. A very
large part of it would be offset by the
simple situation of drought - stricken
pastoralists holding far fewer stock
numbers and therefore using far
smaller amounts of money (either their
own or borrowed) for this purpose.
True, if it rains these pastoralists will
be keen to re-stock. But a lot more rain
is needed before re-stocking can even be
considered in huge areas of north-west-
ern NSW and southern Queensland.
However, if the economy as a whole
is not likely to be directly affected by
the reduced flow of money to farmers,
there can be no doubt that specific
sectors of it will be and are already
suffering.
So the latest rural income figures,
depressing as they look, should not
force any re-assessment of the likely
state of liquidity in Australia in 1966.
THE WEEK BRIEFLY
For the economy: Basing its judgment largely
on statistics available for the December half-year, the
ANZ Bank wonders “whether the stimulus of Govern-
ment expenditure will outweigh the decline in some
important sections of private activity in the current
financial year”. The Bank does feel inclined to admit
that more business cheerfulness has been visible since
the start of 1966. There are chances, movements in
Government revenue and expenditure suggest, of a
smaller Budget surplus, “with a slight expansionary
impact over the economy as a whole” . . . The all-
groups export price index showed a decline of 3.3 p.c.
during the December, 1965, half-year, as against the
corresponding 1964 period. December itself registered
a small improvement on November as a result of better
prices for meats, cereals, metals and coal . . . The
Federal Treasury’s latest White Paper, unworried about
“temporary balance-of-payments problems”, left no
stone unturned to criticise the Vernon Committee’s
long-term planning approach.
Por the markets: A hush of pre-decimalisa-
tion descended upon Australian stock exchanges for
two trading days last week. Jockeying among a fairly
wide range of industrial issues in the light of dollar
splits and dividend possibilities kept dealings lively
up till Wednesday and went further to confirm the
previous week’s keener industrial interest. Metal shares
tended to stay off the boil, with investors, as expected,
growing more choosey ... A tighter Budget stared
London in the face and investors could not avoid
meeting its glare any longer. The markets, therefore,
became a trifle more disturbed than they have been
for several weeks and had a just-averted rail strike to
cope with as well . . . Wall Street did not take long
to haul itself up again after dropping on hints of peace
feelers from North Vietnam.
For companies .* “Big shot” motor and fer-
tiliser corporations made prominent news last week ...
Amalgamated Chemicals, linked with fertiliser distribu-
tion, also occupied a takeover hot-seat, without much
distinction so far as prior advice to shareholders was
concerned . . . Reduced vehicle markets played Old
Harry with General Motors-Holdens, whose earnings
slid down 32£ p.c. or by $l2 million at the same time
as Ford of Australia was changing 1964’s $9.8 million
loss into 1965’s $704,550 profit . . . The drift among
motor distributors was emphasised by Volkswagen
dealer LNC Industries, which suffered a 62 p.c. profit
slump and cut its dividend . . . Boral, ICIANZ, CRA
and Mitsui are to avoid unwise competition by com-
bining to build a $2O million ammonia plant at Silver-
water (near Sydney) . . . Overseas groups Mitsubishi
Shoji Kaisha (Japan), Skelly Oil and Swift (both of
USA) may make chemical fertilisers in Queensland
and use natural gas . . . Unevenness was the only
word for textilers: Bradford Cotton and Felt and
Textiles were able to notch higher sales but saw
profits affected by costs and imports. On the other
hand Bruck Mills retained its buoyancy, while Bonds
Industries returned to a traditional steadiness inter-
rupted by 1964-65’s plant installation expenses . . •
Affiliates to building seemed rather variable, too.
Pipemakers Humes and Rocla could plead reduced
government business to excuse slightly lower profits.
A. V. Jennings and William Atkins had no worries
here, while building supplier ARC Industries sounded
reasonably contented.

But there can be no escaping that if
the drought continues much longer in so
m any key areas, the situation could
emerge whereby the level of internal
economic activity could be directly
affected by falling farm incomes, as the
scope for protection against these ill
winds is by no means limitless.
Liquidity pressures could, neverthe-
less, become more serious when the
rains do eventually come and farmers
go all out to re-stock again. The
monetary authorities will need plenty of
room to manoeuvre to be able to keep
up the money supply, and to keep it
going in the right direction, particularly
if the farmers start looking for these
funds in the middle of the normal March-
June seasonal liquidity run-down.
Over to Ralli
rTHE Receiver’s patience is proving
A more than ever rewarding for deben-
ture holders in the stricken Reid Murray
Holdings group. Already, with $27
million in the bank to go towards the
outstanding $5B million debentures of
Reid Murray Acceptance, Mr E. H.
Niemann has another $5 million in
sight as a result of his sale of the
group’s big warehousing subsidiary
Robert Reid Pty Ltd.
This was one of the few limbs in the
dismembered group to survive the crash.
Its continued operation has thus paid
off, to the tune of about $2 million above
what might have accrued had it been
liquidated, the Receiver stated.
The extra cash in the Receiver’s till
($900,000 in an initial payment and the
rest in instalments over 21 months) will
lift the expected return to debenture
holders by about 18 p.c. How the money
will be distributed remains a moot point,
depending on a court ruling on the
ranking of the unsecured (third series)
tranche of debentures.
Ralli Brothers, the UK merchant-
bankers who bought Robert Reid, will
integrate the business with that of Pater-
son Laing and Bruce, which they also
bought recently, under the name of
Paterson Reid and Bruce. As such, this
will now be the largest single ware-
housing show in the country and, un-
happily for us, it will be controlled from
overseas.
How to Close Down?
a store is about to close, it is
amazing the sort of rubbish it can
unload, at a price, to bargain-hunters at
lts “closing-down sale”.
With the large electrical group H. G.
aimer closing down stores fairly regu-
a% these days, and having a great deal
°f stock that appears to be a bit slug-
§lsh to move, the opportunities for mer-
The Bulletin, February 19, 1966
chandising it attractively at “closing-
down sales” are many; there were 24
such opportunities last week alone.
They were not taken. The Receiver of
H. G. Palmer, Sydney accountant Mr
C. H. R. Jackson, does not have this
approach to retailing.
Instead, without any worrying, he
shuts the doors and sacks the staff. This
may be the right way to kill off a group
of stores that are losing money, but
there are some businesses that have
managed to keep alive for years out of
the profits on “closing-down” sales.
Choc-a-bloc
T ocal chocolate producers are putting
more cents in the pound as it were,
by pouring 9 p.c. more chocolate into
their bars to share with sweet tooths the
benefits of last year’s fall in cocoa prices.
But they may well be reversing the
process later this year.
Cocoa prices in 1965 fell to £stg9o a
ton, half their 1964 levels, when world
production was a record. Of the major
producers, Brazil seems the only country
likely to increase production this year.
The West African crops—from Ghana,
Nigeria, Ivory Coast, Togo and
Cameroon are expected to be small,
creating a violent swing from world
surplus to deficit. Prices should soar
again.
Manufacturers, of course, buy well
ahead; when prices are low forward
supplies are bought up, so Australian
consumers will not be affected yet awhile.
Even after adding more chocolate to
the bar, the makers stand to do very
well out of the current cocoa price, for
the better value provided by local
chocolate makers now attracts favorable
publicity and should promote consump-
tion. When the price eventually goes up
and the size of the bar falls, the industry
does not expect to suffer much. A reduc-
tion in weight is effected without fan-
fare.
The existing law for confectionery is
that goods with a gross weight (for ease
of policing, not net weight) of less than
a quarter of a pound (4 oz.) do not have
to be labelled with the net weight. A new
packaging code for all packages of retail
size will be implemented in all States on
January 1, 1967, reducing the exemption
weight to 3 oz. After this date, a
quarter pound block will actually have
to be a quarter of a pound.
The size of smaller bars will still be
anyone’s guess. - x

were stood down, and those who could
get to work under their own steam
trickled in late and went home early.
Always prone to lease the life out of
a situation, Premier Bolte, who was in
San Francisco exploring financial ways
to develop the gas resources in Bass
Strait, chose the highly-charged atmo-
sphere to suggest these resources might
have to be developed by private enter-
prise and not by the State’s Gas and
Fuel Corporation, whose workers were
out on strike. To fellow citizens whose
gas jets were burning very low, this idea
had more than a passing attraction,
Bolte said he was looking for a cool
£BO million or so, which from his
previous experience of rebuffs from the
Loan Council, he couldn’t see coming
from that source. If he was calculating to
forewarn the Loan Council, stir those
opposed to foreign exploitation of local
resources or simply goad the strikers, he
couldn’t have succeeded better. Both
State opposition parties went immedi-
ately up in arms, reading into the pro-
posal an intention to sell off the Gas
and Fuel Corporation to private enter-
prise. Trades Hall Council chief Mr Jor-
dan, the strike leader, got his figures
crossed. He understood profits from the
Bass Strait gas would run into about £BO
/million a year in fact the amount of
capital Sir Henry posed as needed to get
it reticulated.
Meanwhile Esso has “tentatively”
called tenders for the necessary pipelines
to link its gas field to the Gippsland
shore, though saying they would be sub-
ject to successful negotiations being
made for the sale of the gas. Local tube-
makers, including BHP itself which
owns the Bass Strait lease, Humes,
Rocla and Stanton have all been getting
ready to supply pipes for this and gas
lines projected in other parts of the
country.
The fact that BHP has not an-
nounced its plans makes Bolte’s mission
in California all the more mysterious.
One would have thought BHP and Esso
together, in a happy Australian-foreign
partnership, could find the capital sums
needed without bringing in anybody
else, or indeed putting the Gas and Fuel
Corporation up for sale.
Copy Cats
f|\) xerox has by now become a
A regular verb, although it may take
up to two years before Australians will
be found xeroxing their documents per
medium of the telephone, as is possible
(experimentally) in America. Neverthe-
less, on the presently available copying
machines, Rank Xerox (Australia) Pty
does very nice business, according to
the English parent’s managing director,
Mr T. A. Law, who is spending a few
days in Australia.
It may also be quite some time before
the consumable items needed to produce
Xerox copies, toner powder and
selenium drums, can be manufactured in
this country, Mr Law believes. The
existing and immediately projected
market would not permit the requisite
economies of scale.
Rank Xerox, UK, is immensely proud
of its new £stg4 million consumables
plant in Holland, which has taken the
group right into the heart of an ex-
panding Common Market territory.
Here, and right throughout operations
in 63 overseas countries, a fresh emphasis
is being placed upon incorporating the
Xerox facsimile machines with office
systems, even to the extent of co-
operating with computers.
By the way, Rank Xerox is not con-
fining its advertising tc the well-known
monkeys, and male models, as a matter
of principle. The company is far from
averse to females!

The Attraction of Tourism
Around the world with Mr Curphy
By CROESUS
PR all our roving sportsmen and pop singing ambassadors the world’s image of
Australia remains misty. At least that is the impression of Mr Noel Curphy,
general manager of the Victorian Chamber of Manufactures, whom I talked with
last week on his return from a four months’ business,trip overseas.
True, as a result of intensive Govern-
ment efforts, we are skimming off a fair
number of migrants from the affluent
societies of Britain and Europe but, as
Curphy sees it, not nearly enough. To
succeed better, he thinks we will have to
do three things: improve our general
publicity over a wider front, develop
tourism and improve amenities for
overseas visitors.
Curphy found most other countries
are far ahead of us in all three of these
directions. In some of them, like Spain,
tourism is the number one industry and
“invisible” export earnings from it are
enormous. In any year Britain can
usually count up to a million tourists
roaming the country spending money;
all European countries are alive with
them.
We will have to catch up. For while
we may think this is God’s own country
(strikes and all), most of the rest of the
world is not aware of it. Curphy thinks
the task of informing them is primarily
the responsibility of the Government,
especially in the tourist field. He envis-
ages that ultimately we will have to have
a Federal Ministry of Tourism, with
pretty wide responsibilities, tied in with
our efforts to attract migrants. As a start
he thinks the Government should appoint
a select committee to canvass the pos-
sibilities. He is full of ideas himself and
is putting them into a report to his
Chamber and this will be forwarded on
to the Government.
Some of his ideas are engagingly
simple. We don’t make nearly enough
of the attractions of our climate. So, for
example, why not whet Londoners’ appe-
tites during their cold winter by adver-
tising summer temperatures here in
prominent places, say in The Strand and
above Charing Cross Station! (The only
sign advertising Australia in London I
can remember was one of our apples
and pears, surely two of our lesser
fruits”, in Piccadilly.) Mr Curphy
w °uld not stop in The Strand, however,
and sees a cold weather band across the
whole Northern Hemisphere where our
*tigh temperatures should be advertised
f°r the benefit of potential migrants and
tourists (he even sees a big future in
attracting tourists from Japan).
And at our end of the deal, he believes
We w iU have greatly to improve our
te cepfion facilities for tourists. Travel-
lers arriving at our international airports
must be better looked after, luggage-
handling facilities improved, Customs
reception made more friendly, and “get-
aways” speeded, things these, and
they wouldn’t cost us so much. More
precisely, we should ensure that the new
Tullamarine airport incorporates the
most modern reception devices to be
found anywhere.
Again, on an advertising strain, are
we sure we’ve got the best name for our
overseas airline? We may be proud of
“Qantas”, but, unlike the overseas air-
lines of most other countries, the name
suggests nothing to a foreigner about the
country which owns it and so does little
to draw attention to this country (I was
putting words into Mr Curphy's mouth
on this point).
All this may seem small chips to ex-
porters used to counting in bales and
bushels, and it could be Mr Curphy will
find it difficult to capture Federal
Ministers with his views that we should
go all-out to swell our invisible exports
in this way. When a questioner at the
Chamber’s economic forum in Melbourne
last year suggested to Mr Holt that
tourism should be given a higher priority
in the national order of things, the future
PM appeared to be fairly cold on the
idea. Going on the latest build-up of net
invisible imports, at least, the new
Treasurer should make himself as inter-
ested in getting more offsets from in-
visible exports like tourism as in main-
taining capital inflow.
Mr Curphy admits that the rival
tourist attractions and their more rapid
development in overseas countries are
going to make it very difficult for early
results to be achieved on this front here.
Distance, if not climate, doesn’t lend all
that attraction to either migrants or
tourists when the facilities and prospects
on their own doorsteps are as good as
they are in most European countries.
Nor, talking now of immigration
prospects, should we run away with the
idea that things are tough economically
in Britain and Europe. In Mr Curphy’s
view, Britain’s buoyant domestic eco-
nomic climate completely belies the
heavy strains sterling was subjected to
until quite recently. Mr Curphy found
the British economy had in fact been

lifted to a much higher pitch during the
four years since his previous visit.
Despite the need to continue the 10 p c.
surcharge on imports to galvanise
the balance of payments, confidence in
sterling has improved sufficiently to put
aside thoughts of devaluation. The
current high level of consumption and
employment in the UK economy (un-
employment is down to H p.c.) are
accepted without much question, he told
me.
While Mr Curphy could throw little
light on what appeared to him a com-
placent attitude among business people
in Britain on the heavy indebtedness of
the country to Paris Club members, he
inclined to the view that none of the
latter (Washington neither) wanted to
see sterling devalued and were quite
happy in providing the voluminous short-
term credit necessary to hold sterling up.
His impression was that a sort of super-
credit mentality was now pervading the
Western democracies and that it had
come to stay. The big thing now for any
country with a shaky balance of pay.
ments was not so much when visible
reserves might run out but rather how
much it could borrow to preserve its
exchange parity, an exercise in which
everybody was anxious to assist (and
earn the high going-rate of interest for
their troubles).
If one of the biggest challenges to our
immigration programme was in the high
level of prosperity in Europe (propped
up as it is by international credit devices)
and the increasing attraction of immi-
gration between European countries
themselves, Mr Curphy thought that this
could be accentuated in the event of
Britain joining the Common Market,
which he thought most likely to happen
in the not too distant future. For this and
other reasons he considers we should
think more in terms of attracting
migrants from the United States, where
he believes we would find a ready re-
sponse even without an officially spon-
sored scheme, which of course is ruled
out at present. (Mr Bob Crosby is
apparently not alone among Americans
to have the urge to come and live here.)
Although Mr Curphy found little
evidence that Britain’s balance of pay-
ments troubles were affecting the flow
of capital to Australia (I have some
reservations about that), a growing pre-
occupation with Common Market
possibilities among UK manufacturers
has apparently been causing them to look
with diluted interest at the prospects for
expanding sales to Australia. Last year’s
highly publicised combined operation of
Britain’s Australian trade representatives
called home to convince manufacturers
of the opportunities for sales expansion
here was not, it seems, an unqualified
success largely because of the rival
attractions of the closer-to-hand European
market.
the moral in this, according to Mr
Curphy, is that, to gather export business,
manufacturers, be they English or Aus-
tralian, must go out to the markets and
look them over personally. If they en-
joy some tourism themsel 7 es on the way
and a tax allowance as an incentive when
they return home, presumably so much
the better.

Ticklish Times for World Steel
Steel mills become prestige symbols
By JOHN G. HARDY
PAWNING a steel industry has become an even more sought-after national status
symbol than running an international airline, having a huge sports stadium
or building an opera house.
No matter how uneconomic, no matter
what the world supply and demand situa-
tion may be, and no matter how much
it will burden the economy by misusing
its resources, national prestige has
demanded that more and more countries
(and not only the “emerging” • ones,
either) should build steel mills.
A little while ago, no one in Australia
could have cared less about this. Now
it is a matter of great concern. Not only
are Australia’s millions of dollars worth
of iron ore exports going to a country,
Japan, that depends heavily on selling
its finished steel on world markets, but
a large proportion of Australia’s own
projected steel production is destined for
export particularly if a West Aus-
tralian industry starts up. Australia’s own
steel industry could never exhaust the
existing known deposits of iron ore, not
even under the most optimistic pro-
jections of steel demands. So exporting
iron ore is here to stay provided our
customers are doing enough business
selling steel to want it.
This means the world steel situation
can. no longer be ignored in Australia.
And present indications are that this
situation is going from bad to worse,
with no sign of relief.
World production of steel in 1965
seems to have been close to 460 mill,
ton out of a capacity of 550 mill, ton
in 55 countries, according to “Der
Volkswirt”. The “Montan Union”, that
is. the High Authority for Iron and Coal
of the European Economic Community
(EEC), quotes an output of 444 mill,
ton for the same year, of which a little
over 71 p.c. was supplied by the five
major producing nation’s:'

As global production has risen between
1964 and 1965, on the Montan Union’s
figures, by 5.6 p.c., and the major pro-
ducers have bettered their performance
to a much lesser degree (West Germany’s
output actually receded), the “great leap
forward” must have come from the
ranks of medium and small producers
in other words, from nations which
belong or belonged to the so-called
“traditional importers”. While the
world’s output of steel has doubled
during the last twelve years, many of the
newcomers have increased their facilities
four and nearly five times in less years.
Latin America produced only 3.1
mill, ton in 1958; by 1965 this had risen
to 8.9 mill. ton. A similar advance took
place in Africa, where 1.9 mill, ton in
1958 were stepped up to 4.3 mill, ton in
1965. But the star performer did much
better: in the Far East, excluding Japan
and China, production jumped from 2.5
mill, ton (1958) to 11.7 mill, ton (1965),
the bulk of which came from India.
India’s output, in spite of all sorts of
vicissitudes in the beginning, reached 4.8
mill, ton in 1965, and is expected to rise
to 9 mill, ton in 1967 and to 16.5 mill,
ton in 1971. On paper, increases should
"accelerate from then on, as every year
one so-called “swadesti” (indigenous)
steel mill with a range of 2 mill, ton is
supposed to start operations. And there
is always the chance that America will
install the fifth plant in the public sector,
now that Russia has taken over the fourth
mill (her second installation) at Bokaro,
where the biggest blast furnace in the
world (71,000 cubic feet) is going to be
built.
Although production is still small, a
foundation for a real steel industry has
been laid in the Philippines, Pakistan,
North Korea, Malaysia, Taiwan and
Singapore. Development plans of a more
general nature exist for South Korea,
Thailand, Ceylon, Burma and, of course,
Indonesia. All these developments must
cut into the potential markets for the
Japanese steel industry and so for Aus-
tralian iron ore.
Mainland China seems to be able to
make 10 mill, ton a year in quite sophis-
ticated qualities. Informed estimates
speak of 1700 and 2000 different
varieties. About 60 p.c. of the total
output comes from the w6rks in Anshan
in the north west. In one way, at least,
China appears to be doing better than
even the industrialised countries: its
fire-bricks are said to last 1200 heats
against the traditional average of 300 in
many other countries. Most of the plants
today are built in the country, but a
very modern installation has just been
ordered from Voeest, in Austria, for a
capacity of 650,000 ton.
In a different class altogether is Japan,
the only country in the world which does
not import steel, the country with the
highest percentage (40 p.c.) of oxygen
steel and the country with the best
utilisation of coke (optimum 946 lb. pet
ton of raw steel). And also the country
with an unprecedented rate of growth in
steel making until yesterday. Today it
is no longer a fight for growth but for

profits, in order to survive. Eleven
integrated mills supply 98 p.c. of all the
pig iron and 76 p.c. of all rolled pro-
ducts. The six biggest firms (Yawata,
Fuji, Nippon Kokan, Kawasaki, Sumi-
tomo and Kobe Steel) have agreed on
the appointment of “inspectors” to super-
vise a voluntary cut-back in production
of 10 p.c., but the pressure is apparently
so great that one of the agreement
partners has already started “to shoot
under water”.
Not less than 49 blast furnaces and
45 converters turned out close to 41
mill, ton of steel in 1965. Exports, how-
ever, have fallen from 6.9 mill, ton in
1964 to 6.2 mill, ton in 1965 (sales to
Russia and Italy down, but up to USA,
India, Taiwan and Australia). Nobody
believes any more that the export target
of 7.7 mill, ton for 1966 can be
achieved.
The simple fact is that, in spite of all
modern developments, the world demand
for steel as a percentage of overall import
demands has remained practically un-
changed for the last eight years. While
the gap between world production and
capacity has widened from 10 p.c. in
1953 to 20 p.c. in 1963 and 27 p.c. in
1965, it is significant that the index
figures for steel imports have decreased
for Latin America, Africa and the Far
East (excluding Japan and China), from
269 points in 1953 to 236 points in 1958
and to 127 points in 1962.
Worse still, the industrialised nations
had 33 mill, ton of steel available for
export on their hands in 1953 and sold
exactly half. In 1963 steel on offer
amounted to 101 mill, ton, of which
only 37 mill, ton found buyers. Within
this set-up, a regrouping has taken place:
the countries of the EEC, Great Britain
and the United States have lost on ex-
ports relatively; the slack has been taken
up by Russia and the “small exporting
countries” (Canada, Austria, the Come-
con countries, Australia, etc.).
European countries behind the
Curtain produced, without Russia, 26.7
mill, ton in 1964: Poland, 9 integrated
steel works, 8.5 mill, ton; Czechoslovakia,
4 mills with the biggest in Europe, 8.4
mill, ton; East Germany, 2 mills and
smaller plants, 4.1 mill, ton; Rumania,
2 very modern plants, 2.9 mill, ton;
Hungary, 2 plants (rather specialised),
2 3 mill, ton; Bulgaria, negligible so far,
0.5 mill. ton.
Russia’s output from 15 “great mills”
and dozens of medium and small plants,
concentrated in 5 “centres”, reached 91
mill. ton. Little of this is produced
under the LD process and none by the
Swedish Kaldo method. The first process
they bungled with “do -it - yourself”
methods, hoping to save the royalties;
the second they never tried. On the
other hand, 65 p.c. of all furnaces are
heated by natural gas. The premier mills
in Russia do not compare badly with
the best in Japan and USA.
Times are tough for Europe’s steel
makers in general and in the EEC in
particular. The Montan Union had, in
1965, a total capacity of 100 mill, ton,
but produced only 88 mill. ton. In West
Germany 35,000 men are on “repair
holidays”'or on short time; it is doubt-
ful whether the welter of mergers (three
within the last few years) will result in
sufficient rationalisation to get rid of
the profit drag of over-production. A
number of companies have returned out-
right losses; nearly all of them have re-
duced their dividends. Prices are still
falling under the influence of price cutting
(up to 15 p.c.), mainly by Belgium, while
costs are going up through demands for
higher wages. The unions are asking for
9 p.c. more cash and fringe benefits,
which together will mean an increase, if
granted, of about 12 p.c.
Production in France was nearly 10
p.c. below plan and the Government has
earmarked 300 mill, francs of the last
bond issue as loans at 4 p.c. for the
modernisation of the industry. Austria’s
output in 1965 of 3.2 mill, ton was the
same as in 1960 and exports are falling,
although prices are below world market
levels. Italy alone seems to be pro-
gressing, after driving production from
5.7 mill, ton in 1955 to 14.4 mill, ton
in 1965.
In Great Britain output rose in 1965
by only 0.6 p.c. to 27 mill, ton, but
exports remained unchanged. The fore-
cast for 1966 i®, a fall in production to
25 mill. ton. Richards, Thomas and
Baldwins has already dismissed 300 men
and put others on short time. Nobody is
even venturing a guess where, during the
next five years, £stg6oo mill, will come
from in order to finance the investments
scheduled by the National Plan.
Tn the United States thigs seem to be
A booming. Are they really? Few people
realise that last year’s record production
of 122 mill, ton was not so much better
than the output ten years ago of 117
mill. ton. The net average profit for
steelmakers in 1964 was 9.2 p.c., against
a return of 19.9 p.c. for automobile
manufacturers and 12.7 p.c. for all in-
dustries. Price movements are against
steel, which gained between 1963 and
1965 only two points, compared with
four points in wholesale prices generally
and six points for consumer goods. On
the other hand, steel today is very much
dearer than the so-called “replacement
commodities”. Since 1947 prices for
cement have increased by 66 p.c., for
glass 46 p.c., for aluminium 71 p.c., but
for steel 113 p.c. And the arch enemy,
plastics, is 6 p.c. cheaper today.
In spite of all this, 12 new companies
have entered the steel field in the United
States since 1959. As the “Big Ten”
cover 79 p.c. of total production, the
newcomers are small. Many wish to
remain small because they are less
“strike prone”. It remains to be seen

what will happen to steel in USA now
the industry has overcome the strike
hurdle, which boomed up twice last year
when stocks will be used instead of
hoarded and if and when President
Johnson is successful with his peace over-
tures in Vietnam.
On paper, and measured on per capita
consumption, the outlook for steel is
bright enough: United States, 1188 lb.;
West Germany, 970 lb.; Australia, 880
lb.; Japan, 700 lb.; Asia without Japan,
22 lb,; Africa, 38 lb.; Latin America,
88 lb.
Against these hopeful possibilities
stands a forecast by the Montan Union
that by 1970 not less than 16 “pure im-
porting countries” will become producers
and that 15 producing nations will
double their capacity within the next
three years.
Demand for steel is, of course, rising
not only in relation to population
growth but also in step with increasing
standards of living. However, the curve
is no longer climbing at the same angle,
as a comparison with, say, the Sydney
Harbor Bridge (a steelmaker’s dream!)
and any modern pre-stressed concrete
bridge will illustrate. The cars in the
’thirties had real steel bodies. Tomorrow’s
might be plastic or fibreglass. Chemical
compounds, glass, aluminium, even
miniaturisatiop—all are eating into the
domain of steel.

The Incredible Book Trade
By MICHAEL BAUME
The book trade has gone too far. Its
prices are too high, its mark-ups are
fantastic and its restrictive trade practices
are a disgrace. But because of its stagger-
ing inefficiency, its profits are not really
high at all.
What it needs is a thorough going-
over in order to smarten up its policies
and practices. It looks as if it will get
one soon, and not before time.
For there seems little doubt that the
book trade is going to face a pretty close
and critical examination now that the
Trade Practices Bill has been passed.
There can be no question that the
practices in this business come within
the scope of the act. These are described
yet certainly not justified —in a
“Current Affairs Bulletin” just issued by
the University of Sydney’s Department
of Adult Education.
The pricing of British books imported
here (and note that sales of locally pub-
lished books totalled about £3 million
last year, against £2O million worth of
imported books) is one of the more
annoying features of this industry.
According to the “Schedule of Prices”
issued by the Australian Booksellers’
Association to the book trade, a book
with a trade price in Britain of 10s.
sterling (12s. 6d. or $1.25 Australian)
would be retailed in Australia at 255. 6d.
or $2.55. This means more than 100 p.c.
mark-up, before freight.
The author of this “CAB” does not
discuss the merits of such a fantastic
mark-up and rather quaintly says that
really the question of whether a book
is cheaper or dearer in Australia than
in Britain depends on the amount of the
discount allowed by the publisher to the
retailer.
This is a brand of factual nonsense
that is strictly true but gives quite the
wrong impression. It is true that, if a
book retails in the UK for 20s sterling,
the basis on which the Australians start
making their 100 p.c. or so mark-ups is
not 20s. but the trade price.
No matter what discount the British
publisher gives, however, the reason his
books are so ridiculously dear in Aus-
tralia is the local mark-up. This is far
above the ruling rate allowed UK book-
sellers for the same books.
It is also curious to find the author
of this “CAB” writing about the retail
booksellers’ margin in terms of “dis-
count” from the retail price rather than
a mark-up from the trade prices. This
discount, he says, is with few exceptions
P-c. on an Australian book. It is
more sensible to say that the retail mark-
U P is 50 p.c. on the trade price which is
exactly what this means.
If inefficiency has kept book retailing
profits at low levels despite this large
retail margin, the same appears true of
the publishing end of the industry. The
“CAB’s” break-down of publishing costs
takes the example of a book that retails
at 60s. and with a trade price of 40s.
‘lts retail price would have been related
to its cost of printing—about four times
seems the rough average—which in this
case was 16s.
The author would get about 10 p.c.
of the retail price, or 6s. in this case,
leaving the publisher with 18s. per book
to cover his costs and make a profit. So
inefficient is this industry that the
normal publisher would expect to pay
about 13s. 4d. (one-third of his return)
in overheads, leaving a gross profit of
only 4s. Bd. a book, or about 12 p.c.
on turnover, provided he gets rid of his
edition.

MAN ON THE LAND
Quests for Farmer Unity
Cracks in the grand design
TT seems quite on the cards that the Australian National Farmers’ Union will be
forced to withdraw from the Internationa! Federation of Agricultural Producers.
Inability to solve budgetary matters on the part of the component organisations of the
NFU is the reason.
They (the components, not the NFU)
have plenty of money but apparently
Australian farmers need to be persuaded
that they need a voice in international
farming conferences Perhaps they feel
that international goings-on are too
remote and are best left to the Depart-
ment of Trade, Department of Primary
Industry, government generally, and in-
stitutions such as the Wheat Board and
the International Woo’ Secretariat.
This attitude can be readily under-
stood. Yet IFAP is extremely valuable
as an exchange house of ideas. It brings
the developed nations in touch with the
underdeveloped. Governments, certainly,
make the decisions, but governments also
take note of IFAP.
If IFAP is good enough for the US
France, Great Britain, Canada and New
Zealand, then surely it is good enough
for Australia. This is something that
only the farmers themselves can work
out. They can hardly ask for a Govern*
ment subsidy for the NFU.
It must be borne in mind that, if the
NFU does have to withdraw, Australia
will still be represented by the Australian
Primary Producers’ Organisation. The
APPU gained membership last year (the
NFU has been a member since 1946).
Yet in the case of the APPU, even the
most ardent supporter could hardly claim
that it is anything more than one organ-
isation of many in Australia. Certainly
it has a loyal membership, a very work-
able constitution, and all-States’ rep-
resentation.
The NFU, however, is, or was, the
closest thing vet to a truly representative
Australian farming organisation. It
seemed destined te develop, with the
co-operation of the APPU and other
groups, into the Australian National
Farmers’ Federation. Now the grand
idea seems to be disintegrating.
The withdrawal of the Australian
Woolgrowers’ and Graziers’ Council from
the NFU,-at about the time of the reserve
price referendum late last year, was a
severe blow. Despite the fact that a
prominent member of the same Wool-
growers’ and Graziers’ Council, Mr R.
McAuley, of South Australia, became
president of the NFU, the Graziers are
still out and may remain out. No one
seems to know whether Mr McAuley’s
appointment as president was an exten-
sion of the olive branch, in the hope that
the Woolgrowers’ and Graziers’ Council
might come back Some say it was;
others that it was just his turn.
This strange situation is made possible
by the NFU ruling that the president,
whoever he may be, relinquishes his
organisational affiliation for the term of
his presidency. Mr McAuley is a big
woolgrower and was the South Australian
chairman of the Committee for the Re-
tention and Improvement of the Free
Wool Market. He proved a fearsome
adversary for Sir William Gunn and
accepted a wager with him on the out-:
come of the referendum.
If all this seems a maze of improbable
affiliations and paths leading nowhere,
it is and it isn’t. It is possible to discern
what is likely to happen. Unity appears
destined to evolve into a two-party
system which, we admit, is a contradic-
tion. The NFU and the APPU seem
likely to come closer together and in
NSW and South Australia are already
affiliated.
The Woolgrowers’ and Graziers’ Coun-
cil will retain its own autonomy and, m

wool matters, will demand the respect
it believes it has earned. Beef likewise
may be oriented towards the Wool-
erowers’ and Graziers’ Council. Dairying,
grains, fruits and vegetables, poultry and
pigs may be the special preserve of the
NFU-APPU group, provided it has the
support of the very strong Australian
Wool and Meat Producers’ Federation.
In industrial matters —wages, tariffs,
probate, land tax, rates, drought aid and
similar matters —there will be complete
unity between the two major groups. In
a sense, there is already. A really radical
farmer in Australia is a rarity.
It could be argued that unity is only
necessary in matters, such as these, which
come largely under the heading of farm
lobbying. For special commodity prob-
lems the organisation closely in touch with
the particular commodity could be left
to handle matters alone. If farmers want
to belong to a bewildering array of
organisations, frequently belonging to
more than one at a time, then it is their
business (and their annual subs).
The question has been asked, in respect
1 of unity, where is the enemy? A good
question. Of course there is no real
enemy. There is increasing evidence that
rural Australia and urban Australia are
growing even further apart. Even a
drought finds the great mass of urban
Australia unsympathetic to farm prob-
lems. Farmers, in turn, seem utterly
unaware that there are desperate prob-
lems being created in the Australian
cities.
It is perfectly true, but pointless, for
wheatgrowers to argue that 20 years ago
they provided wheat at below world cost
to the Australian public.
The most significant remarks in a long
time on this subject came at the recent
Australian Institute of Political Science
seminar on Australian cities. Professor
Ruth Atkins, of the University of New
South Wales, said: “It is time the growth
°f big cities had at least as much atten-
tion as the problems of rural production
and marketing. A general policy about
cities is scarcely possible at State level,
whereas the Federal authorities are in a
position to take the broad view. They
may well be forced into this.
es State governments divert more
attention and resources to the big cities’
problems, they will demand Federal
assistance. If any scheme for new cities
is to get off the drawing board this must
require Federal-State joint enterprise,
and major allocations of initiating capital
at least.
“Our problem is mainly one of political
'persuasion. Any claims for high-level
attention and finance for cities faces
competition from all sorts of other more
easily recognisable and deserving appli-
cants. The cause of the metropolis starts
from behind scratch because there is no
unified section of the community whose
interest it is to push governments into
new efforts.”
One can imagine the retort of many
farmers to this—if we did not provide
the exports there would be no cities.
There’s some truth in this, perhaps, but,,
for farmers, little comfort.


VICTORIA INSTITUTE OF COLLEGES
Position of Secretary
The Victoria Institute of Colleges was recently established
under legislation by the Government of the State of Victoria.
The Institute itself is not a teaching institution but, in
accordance with the State Legislation, may admit to membership
as an affiliated college any institution other than Universities
offering tertiary education in Victoria. The objects of the
Institute are to foster the development and improvement in its
affiliated colleges of tertiary education in technical, commercial
and othei fields of learning, including the liberal arts and
humanities
The Institute is also responsible for a number of other
functions related to the general development of tertiary educa-
tion, the development and co-ordination of activities, and the
financial requirements of its affiliated colleges.
The Institute is empowered to award degrees, diplomas and
other awards to students of affiliated colleges who have attained
the required standards in courses approved by the Institute.
The Institute will be governed by a Council of 28 members.
There will be a full-time secretariat comprising a Vice-
President, together with other staff, the principal member of
which will, for the present, be the Secretary. The Vice-President
will be the Chief Executive Officer of the Institute. He will also
be chairman of the Board of Studies, which will make to
Council recommendations in regard to instruction, studies,
examinations, research and admission to degrees, diploma and
other awards.
The Interim Council has been successful in obtaining as its
Vice-President Dr P. G. Law, C.8.E., M.Sc., D.App.Sc., J.P.,
who will take up his duties in April next.
The Interim Council of the Institute is now inviting applica-
tions for the post of Secretary of the Institute at a salary of
£3,750 per annum. Other conditions of employment, such as
provident fund, recreation leave and the like, will be the subject
of discussion with the successful applicant.
The Secretary will be responsible to the Vice-President. In
addition to generally assisting the Vice-President in relation to
the functions, responsibilities and power of the Institute as
outlined above, his duties will include the keeping of records;
the handling of correspondence; the drafting of regulations and

AGRISEARCH
Worries of Higher Stocking
Sheep*s teeth wear rapidly
/Current scientific opinion in New Zealand is that most of the
wear to sheep’s teeth is caused by inadvertent chewing on
soil particles. The fear is that excessive wear, already an
occasional cause of economic loss, will become a general
problem if stocking rates continue to rise. The New Zealanders
reject an Australian claim that plant phytoliths (non-crystalline
deposits of silica within the plant tissue) are largely responsible
for wear. Put simply, the trans-Tasman scientists believe that
it is the dirt on and about the herbage rather than the dirt in
the herbage that does the damage. They can support their
view with appealingly simple evidence.
They instance three farms near each other in the Wairarapa
district. On one the sheep’s teeth wore out rapidly and the
animals had to be sold off at an uneconomically early age. On
the second farm tooth wear was moderate and on the third
farm it was scarcely noticeable. On the first and second farms
the stocking rates were about four sheep to the acre, but only
one sheep to the acre was being carried on the low-wear farm.
All the sheep were of similar breeding and the soil also was
comparable, containing approximately the same proportions
of sand, silt, and clay.
Faeces uncontaminated by contact with the ground were
collected monthly from each farm and the soil particles in
them were separated chemically. The amount of soil present was
highest in August, reaching a peak of 60 p.c. on the high-wear
farm while at the same time it was 35 p.c. on the medium-wear
farm and only 12 p.c. on the low-wear farm. Pasture samples
were also collected when the faeces were gathered and treated
in a similar way to extract the phytolith content. This figure was
uniformly puny for all farms. So in New Zealand, at least, the
mineral content in pasture plants would not seem to cause any
considerable trouble. It could be calculated from the soil con-
tent in the faeces that during the three worst months, July to
September, each sheep in the high-wear farm ate a total of
25 lb. of soil. On the low-wear farm the consumption rate
would have been only 1 lb. a head. From the phytolith content
of the pasture it could be calculated that in the same period
the sheep would have eaten only a few ounces of this abrasive
material.
The amount of soil eaten varies from year to year depending
on a number of influences. However, the most important of
them is undoubtedly the average height of the pasture. This,
in turn, is largely determined by the stocking rate.
Worms no worse
Qheepmen also worry whether higher stocking will lead to
greater trouble with worms. Not much is known yet about
this question, but a little evidence now to hand is reassuring.
In a stocking-rate trial on the old CSIRO Experimental Station
at Canberra, two, four, six and nine adult merino sheep per
acre were set-stocked for four years. During this time no dif-
ficulty was encountered in keeping worm egg-counts down to
an inconsequential level at all stocking rates. Moreover and
this is the encouraging feature there was no significant dif-
ference between the egg-counts at each of the stocking rates.
All these sheep were drenched in spring and autumn each
year with phenothiazine. When they were replaced by young
sheep of the same breeding, worm infestation quickly became
troublesome, despite a more frequent drenching programme.
However, all these young sheep, regardless of the stocking
rate, were similarly afflicted. This shows merely that young
sheep are more susceptible to worms than old sheep.

MARKET POINTERS
Benefits from Decimal Switch
Tidy minds and generous hearts
By JASON
SWITCHING to decimals may be a nuisance at the moment, but it could bring
some benefits in slightly higher dividends to shareholders this year. Now that
the stock exchanges have asked companies to express their dividends in terms of
cents per share rather than as percentages of the par value, the spotlight will certainly
fall on those companies whose dividends do not convert readily to the new currency.
J
If their boardrooms are occupied by
directors who combine a tidy mind with
a generous heart, companies in this situa-
tion will pay out a little more to their
shareholders to simplify the whole thing
by rounding the dividend rates out to
the next highest cents-a-share figure.
Some companies have already done
something about it. ARC Industries
apparently had decimals in mind as well
as the goodwill of shareholders when it
upped its interim from 31 p.c. to four
p.c. —equal to 2 cents a 50 cent share.
And Ralph McKay said it was also think-
ing about decimals (with no doubt a pass-
ing thought about the drought) when it
lowered its interim from 61 p.c. to 6
p.c. (three cents).
Among the companies that may add
a bit to shareholders’ payments, one that
should be riding fairly high on the hire-
purchase wave is lAC Holdings, which
has been in the habit of paying Ilf p.c.
dividends totalling exactly 7d. Main-
tenance of this rate would produce the
awkward per share pay-out of 5.83 cents.
By paying 12 p.c. instead, the sum would
be a nice round 6 cents.
BHP has been edging its dividend up
each year. The current rate of 9.16 p.c.
(22d. per share) equals 18.33 cents. The
company could take the opportunity to
sweeten shareholders with a rise to 91
p.c. (18f cents) or even 91 p.c. (19 cents).
McPhersons has held dividend steady
at 81 p.c. (20d.) for five years; this
converts to 161 cents. It would be timely
for the company to augment this in
1966 to 17 cents, a rate of 81 p.c.,
despite the losing profit trend this year.
Will SA Rubber, heavily involved
financially in the new tyre business, dare
to break away from the Ilf p.c. rate
(6fd.) it has paid for six years? The
converted rate is 5.625 cents. A 12 p.c.
rate would mean 6 cents per share to
holders.
Clearly anxious to polish up its stock
market image, David Jones appears
certain to add something to last year’s
pay-out of 131 p.c., paid after many
years at 121 p.c. A 14 p.c. rate (7 cents
per ss. share) would not surprise.
The 131 p.c. rate paid by Steamships
Trading for four years was an even Bd.
Its equivalent in decimals is 6f cents.
The company could easily improve this
to 7 cents, a 14 p.c. rate, even though
it has extra capital from the one-for-five
premium issue to service.
Several companies that have been
making regular increments to their divi-
dend rates, and currently have dividends
in fractions of a penny, could, with their
next increment, round these off in cents.
year’s new company floats are a
sad lot, but perhaps not quite so
sad as I suggested in the February 5
issue. I said the success rate was only 35
p.c.; in fact it is only 40 p.c. For in
looking at the current prices I omitted
to take into consideration what impact
last October’s one-for-two bonus issue
had on the shares of Nutt and Muddle,
the poker machine makers.
True, the recent price of 48c is below
the placement price last year of 52c; but
it would equal 72c a share after taking
the bonus into account.

SECURITY ANALYSIS
Threats from Imports and Local Rivals
How will Associated Pulp fare?
TpoixowiNG the annual report for the
"*■ year to June 30, 1965, published
last October, the price of the shares of
Associated Pulp and Paper Mills Ltd
fell from about 31s. 6d. ($3.15) down to
around 28s. 6d. ($2.85). They then
stayed between 28s. and 295. until the
beginning of this year, when they started
to move up, reaching 31s. 6d. again just
prior to the interim announcement. This
announcement, which indicated a 100
p.c. improvement in earnings over the
first half of 1964/5, had the initial effect
of sending the price of the shares up as
high as 345. 9d. but they have reacted
from this price down to 325. 9d. as at the
time of writing. One is left wondering
what is an appropriate price to pay for
Associated Pulp's shares, which over the
last two years have ranged from as high
as 455. 9d. down to 265. 9d. $4.58
to $2.68.
Because Associated Pulp produces a
number of different lines, it could be
difficult to determine the major source
of profits. Fortunately, the company has
made a practice of disclosing its sales
breakdown in money terms and this is at
least some guide to the importance of
its various products. Starting in 1960/1,
the percentages of sales of the various
products to total sales (in money terms)
has been as follows:
Year to June 30 1961 1962 1963 1964 1965
Fine paper 60.3 56.9 58.9 55.0 55.4
Coated papers
& boards 11.1 11.1 13.0 12.4 10.0
Special wrappings 8.2 7.6 8.1 8.4 8.3
Burnieboard 15.2 18.8 16.2 19.3 20.1
Sawn timber
& logs 5.2 5.6 3.8 4.9 6.2
Total 100.0 100.0 100 0 100.0 100.0
Perhaps the only significant figure in
this series is the increasing importance
of Burnieboard in the total of sales. There
seems to be some decline in the impor-
tance of fine papers, but there is no
denying that these still represent The
most important element of sales. Un-
fortunately, we do not know which com-
ponent produces the most profit, either
in absolute terms (although one would
be inclined to think that fine paper must
be the most important) or in proportion
to sales.
A wealth of production statistics are
also available (the cynics say this is
because of the close links with mining,
which would suggest that many other
companies could do with similar links)
and expressed in the form of an index
with 1960/1 as the base year (100),
they appear as follows:
Year to June 30 1961 1962 1963 1964 1965
Pulp 100 84 108 110 129
Paper 100 79 108 118 125
Burnieboard 100 86 106 129 133
Timber 100 77 60 73 95
Since 1957/8, consumption of fine
paper has varied so much from year to
year that, in my view, it is hardly pos-
sible to establish any clear long-term
trend. The percentage change on the
previous year has been as follows:
Year to
June 30 1959 1960 1961 1962 1963 1964 1965
6.2 14.8 5.7 (9.6) 18.8 4.3 8.9
In 1964/5, the total estimated con-
sumption of fine paper in Australia was
111,000 tons. Writing paper made up
about half of this total and this propor-
tion has not changed much over the last
eight years. In fact, little change has
occurred over the last sixteen years
the difference in 1964/5 as against
1948/9 being a much greater proportion
of coated paper at the expense of print-
ing paper.
It will now be interesting to see how
the market has been shared over the last
eight years. The percentages are as
under:
Year to
June 30 1958 1959 1960 1961 1962 1963 1964 1965
Associated
62.2 66.8 65.8 56 7 58.9 58.3 60.6 56 0
Shoalhaven
7.4 6.8 7 8 8.1 11.5 10.8 12.4 17.9
A PM 5.6 5.4 4.7 4.3 3.9 3 5 4 1 4.7
Imports 24.9 21.1 21.8 31.0 25.5 27.4 22.9 21.3
Tt seems to me that these figures point up
the change which has occurred so far
as Associated is concerned since the end
of the 1959/60 year. First in February,
1960, import quotas were finally removed
and this brought about an increase of
nearly fifty p.c. in the share of the
market which went to “Imports”. Gradu-
ally this share has been reduced
mainly by tariff protection—but another
competitor seems to have emerged.
Shoalhaven Paper Mills is a subsidiary
of the large UK papermaker Wiggins
Teape and, while it has taken a long
time for the company to get under way,
it has certainly increased its share of the
market over the eight years.
The result of all these various factors
seems to have been to produce a trend
in earnings and dividends per share
which, to say the least, is unexciting:
Year to
June 30 1958 1959 1960 1961 1962 1963 1964 1965
Earnings 10.9 16.1 15.9 12.1 5.6 12.2 11.2 9.6
Dividends 7.6 9.9 9.9 7.6 6.0 10.0 9.0 9.0
The rates shown here have been
adjusted in respect of new issues and
allowance has been made for the issue
of convertible notes which were con-
verted to ordinary shares on June 30,
1964. As a matter of interest, the earn-
ing rate over the past ten years has only
exceeded 15 p.c. in two years, 1958/9
and 1959/60, and, if one was asked to
pick a reasonable average rate, 11 p.c,
would probably be appropriate. This
would mean that, at the current price of
325. 9d. the shares would be selling at
nearly 15 times the average earnings of
the last ten years. Similarly, an average
dividend rate would be the present rate
of 9 p.c., so the dividend yield would be
5.5 p.c.
There can be no doubt that the
current market price is influenced to
some considerable extent by the excel-
lent result announced for the six months
to December 31, 1965, but, with the
record shown above so far as the com-
pany’s main product is concerned and
so far as the profit and dividend trends
are concerned, the question must be
asked whether there were any excep-
tional factors involved in the first half
of 1965/6.
It may well be that Associated can
stave off the apparent continuing threat
from imports and the apparent increas-
ing threat from Shoalhaven. But, as at
this point of time, it is very difficult to
see the sort of growth in both earnings
and dividends per share that the present
price suggests.

SPECULATOR'S DIARY
A Happy New Year Spirit
With thoughts on Amalgamated Chemicals
fTIHE 1966 market spirit is a welcome relief from the 1965 blues. But the odd 5 p.c.
gain since the beginning of the year on our market pales against the 25 p.c. blast-off
on Tokyo in the same period. Any investor who classifies himself as an international
would do well to follow that exchange.
Mind you, an industrial stock in our
market managed to achieve this appreci-
ation in just one week. From 92c,
Amalgamated Chemicals shares made a
jump to $1.15 on the announcement of
the offer by Dow Chemical of $1.12 for
51 p.c. of the capital, following this up
with a rise to $1.25 when Continental
Oil came into the picture.
To me there were two significant hap-
penings with Amalgamated Chemicals in
the week before the rise. One was the
abnormally large turnover of almost
100,000 shares traded in Sydney and
Melbourne. And the other was what,
to the layman, could only be described
as the emphatic denial of any pending
takeover by the chairman, Mr J. D.
Wilson.
Several months ago, Mr Wilson, in
his pursuit of serving shareholders,
wasn’t slow in proclaiming that the
shares were undervalued. At that time
the stock was being judged only on its
own merits and not on the possibility
of a takeover. Whether Mr Wilson’s
judgment at that time was correct will
not be confirmed until the 1965 accounts
are published.
The pending takeover radically alters
the current worth of the shares. As the
Ducon fiasco so readily illustrated, the
surest way of making profits on the
stock market is to buy before a take-
over. Yet such a practice is a little un-
fair on the'teller. In the case of Amal-
gamated Chemicals, the circumstances
are such that, if there was a securities
commission in this country, an investi-
gation could well be proceeding now.
Not being one of the people in the
know. I waited until the shares were
$1.25 before I bought 400. As well as
Continental Oil, several other possible
bidders are believed to be lingering in
the background. Any contest between
bidders can only result in the shares
being pushed higher.
From Amalgamated Chemicals it’s
not a long haul to the mining market,
where several of my current interests
lie. Most of them are jumping around
so much that it is difficult to pin the
prices down. Take Kathleen Invest-
ments. From $2.20 last week the price
-exploded to $2.48. So on went my 400
shares at $2.50. This must have been
the signal for the shares to react, so I
found myself selling the 400 shares at
$2.40. Nevertheless the profit of $206
is by far the best this year.
Then there was VAM. Tempted to sell
out at 62c, I left my run too late and
found the price back to 55c. Disappoint-
ing as this fall is, the charts predict a
happy ending.
To maintain my stake in the mining
industry, I purchased 200 Western
Mining at $2.60. So far, Western Mining
has been lagging behind most of the
other mining shares. After all, no one
has been terribly excited about gold
currently the only metal contributing to
the group profits of Western Mining.
However, the character of Western
Mining is rapidly changing. With two
American companies the Hanna Min-
ing Company and the Homestake
Mining Company, Western Mining has
extended into the iron ore industry. The
project has reached the stage where the
first shipment to Japan is to be made in
April. Western Mining has also plunged
into the aluminium industry, having
taken a 20 p.c. share interest in Alcoa
Pty Ltd. This complex is also well ad-
vanced with the Kwinana refinery in
Western Australia operating near full
capacity and the smelting, semi-fabrica-
ting and fabricating plants at Port
Henry in Victoria nearing completion.
Important as iron ore and aluminium
are in the medium term, it could be the
current activity in copper exploration in
South Australia that spurs the shares
into action.
