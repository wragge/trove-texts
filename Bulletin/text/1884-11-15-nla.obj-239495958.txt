The Ideal Man.
We have often been at variance wilh our
contemporaries in our views on social and
political matters. But this does not pre-
vent our recognising merit in our
opponents. Saturday’s Echo contains a
thoughtful “leader,” evoked by the Pre-
sidential contest in America. According to
the journal named, that contest proved the
superiority of Monarchical over Republican
institutions. The wire-pullers published
the most scandalous tales of their oppo-
nents’ candidate; showed how humiliating
it would be to place at the head of affairs—
to make Chief Magistrate of 60,000,000 of free-
men—one who had cheated at school, at the
workshop, and at the bar during his youth
and prime, and was open to cheat the nation
during his decline. It is a dreary record.
It shows the would-be leaders of humanity
at their worst. It is just at this point that
the Echo, with customary astuteness, sweeps
into the arena, and explains how all these
evils can be remedied by the simple ex-
pedient of “Monarchy,” where the Chief
Magistrate is raised above such unseemly
struggles, and guides his or her people by
the “grace of God.” There is thought in
this. The Echo says justly: “And, when
all is over, what is the gain ? Has the nation
been sifted, and is the best man retained ?”
[No, he has not, we answer unhesitatingly.
There are thousands of studious, large-
minded, decent men in the United
States to-day who have put forward
no claim for the Presidency, and who
would have had no chance had they
done so—whose claims would be looked on
coldly, if not with ridicule. And thus, ac-
cording to the Echo, the superiority of here-
dity is too obvious to be challenged. In the
Great Republic, where every adult male has
a vote, and where, owing to the curse pro-
nounced on our race by an outraged Crea-
tor, the great mass of men must necessarily
be condemned to the plough, the workshop,
or the shovel, it is little less than stupid to
assert that such people could choose the
man who would do their nation most honour
as Chief. Their lives are mainly given up to
provide bread for themselves and their fami-
lies. They are swayed tnis way and that by
unscrupulous men—by men who climb to
prominence on ladders, the steps of which
are composed of the prejudice, the ignor-
ance, and the shortsightedness of their fel-
lows. How different with Monarchy !
There “ the nation is sifted and the best man
is retained.”
m * *
This will be become apparent it we glance
over the history of the United Kingdom—
the Mother of Nations—for a few hundred
years. The advantage of our method of
securing the ideal man “ d warfs into insigni-
ficance (the Echo speaks) all risks, costs, and
eumbersomeness of Limited Monarchy.’*
Let us glance at it. Henry VIII. was a
Chief who had his people’s welfare at heart.
He showed this by marrying women and
chopping their heads off when they became
disagreeable. Unlike Republican Magis-
trates who, foolishly enough, stoop to argue
with their opponents, he overcame all fri-
volous objections by means of bonfires in
Smithfleld. There were mounds of green
wood about with stakes in the centre, and
those who considered the Monarch’s vie ws
faulty, had a chance given them of standing
by those stakes and frankly stating their
objections before a crowded assembly. We
skip Edward out of compliment to our own
“ideal” Prince, who (D.V.) may be long be-
fore he comes to bis own. Hal’s daughter
Mary followed in her father’s footsteps, and
converted a number of people by the method
so seldom found to fail—the application of
the warm end of a flrestick to the abdomen.
Her s.ster, by another mother (there were
many mothers in the family) improved upon
both. She was a virgin. Russian Catherine
and Spanish Isabella were also virgins.
This, however, by the way. James followed.
He was talented, learned, and conscientious.
He succeeded the woman who murdered
his mother. He himself murdered Raleigh.
But it would be absurd to judge the “ ideal
man” by rules of conduct and morality in-
tended for meaner mortals only. He slob-
bered ; he lied. Each chamber he occupied
proved that, like Russian Peter, the
“Lord’s anointed” could behave like a
savage. But what of that? Then came
Charles, who thought, with Justice, that he
had as much right as his predecessors to pul
off his subjec ts’ toe-nails and drive steel
spikes into their boots. The mulish English
thought otherwise, and so, one cold January
morning, this “ideal” man found himself
endeavouring to address a cultivated British
audience, The impression he made was
favourable, until it struck him that there
was something wrong with his head. Then
he said no more. His son had the [pleasure
of seeing a foreign fleet make bonfires of his
dock-yards. He had other pleasures. His
blood flows through the proudest aris-
tocracy in Europe. This is another of the
advantages possessed by Monarchy from the
earliest limes—an advantage which shows
no sign of curtailment. His brother then
appeared, called to the Chief Magistracy*
not by the vulgar voice of the canaille, but
by the “grace of God.” He endeared him-
self to his Scottish covenanting subjects by
putting steel nuts upon their fingers and
toes and tightening them till the bones were
crunched, and the foolish people became
uncomfortable and demonstrative. To his
Irish subjects he made himself agreeable by
running away from battles which he might
have won, and by always protesting his de-
sire, like the warlike Napoleon III., to die
at the head of his brave troops. The desires
of both Monarchs were somehow frustrated
by causes over which they had no control.
• • •
Of William, Anne, and three of the
Georges, we need say little. Being God’s
vicegerents, they t took advantage of all the
privileges of their position. They had their
courts, favourites (there is no proper
synonym for this), and harlots. Their
blood, like that of Charles II., has been
circulated by means of waiting-maids and
lacqueys through some of our best houses.
Under them nourished a literature of match-
less splendour, which they did not under-
stand. Could they have comprehended it,
they would have attributed its luxuriance
to their benignity and far-sightedness. So
we come to George IV., William, and our
present gracious Sovereign. Of George, we
can now say with certainty that he was the
first bl—gentleman, of course, we mean—in
Europe. He invented a shoe-buckle, said
he had led the Guards at Waterloo, and, like
his father, would lay his head on the block
rather than concede the Catholic claims.
He did not charge at Waterloo. He did not
lay his head on the block. He granted the
Catholic claims, and lived to a good age—the
rottenness of his body keeping pace with the
rottenness of his mind. His father was, pro-
bably, the Echo’s “ ideal man.” He had at
least the courage of his opinions. He con-
quered the Americans in many battles—a
fact that uneducated Americans deny to
this day—and wound up by wiping his hands
of such vulgar people. His son, William
IV., a Sailor Prince (we have had Sailor
Princes in Australia, and loved them), was
known amongst the initiated as “Silly
Billy.” He had a head closely resembling a
pine-apple. From his mouth ran bawdry and
saliva in equal portions. “ Blen remarq-
ahle" said the impassive Talleyrand at a
State dinner, when the ladies had retired
aud our late Lord’s Anointed stood up to
propose a smutty toast. At last we come
to our present First Magistrate, Victoria.
She has been an admirable Chief—a little
lavish, perhaps, but one whose lavishness
was entirely eclipsed by her virtues. She
went down into the literary arena, and
proved to all her superiority over Marti-
nbau, Somerville, Eliot and other English-
women. Of her apparent successor, it is
not necessary to speak, further.than to say
he is a middle-aged man, who, by hereditary
talents, has done a good deal to place the
English nation in the van of progress. He
may not have the same reverence for the
“bulwark of England’s greatness” as his
Sovereign has, but that will come in time.
• • •
We see by this rapid glance how futile
all the efforts of Republicanism must
necessarily be when compared with those
of Monarchy in placing the “ideal man”
at the helm. We have said enough to
hint where Republicanism fails. Of course
we have notj said all. It would require a
volume. And so the following might be said
to be a political axiom. Leaving out the
multitudinous ways in which Republicanism
falls short, its great.and patent error is in
seldom being able to choose the right head,
like Monarchy. There have, no doubt, been
passably decent men—such as Washington,
Jefferson, Lincoln,! and Garfield— who
have by chance been selected for the fore-
most place in the American Republic. But
their private lives, unlike those of our own
Magistrates, will not bear close examination.
It is well to draw a veil over them. They
were good men after their kind,and, posoibly»
tried for the commonweal after their lights.
But this is saying little. It is when compared
with our Chiefs, whether morally or intel-
lectually, that their inferiority is so striking.
Perhaps they themselves were not so much
to blame. They were the creatures of a
vicious system. To give every citizen of a
State a voice in saying who shall guide the
destinies of that State is fundamentally
wrong. They may choose the right mau,
and they may not. They may choose a fool
ora fribble. But with “Limited Monarchy ’
it is otherwise. With us no election “ shakes
the whole people as an attack of fever shakes a
mau, paralyses business, galvanises unheal-
thy sentiment into dangerous activity, and
sows seeds of possible corruption broadcast.’
It is only necessary to think for a moment
what might be the result if England to-day
were a Republic. Why Gladstone or Ten-
nyson, Carlyle or Stuart Mill (if the last
named were alive) might become Chief
Magistrate. Think of it! But we will not
think of it!—we cannot. Imagine Glad-
stone, an old man who chops w ood and writes
Italian lyrics; the author of “In Memoriam;”
the writer of “Sartor Resartus,” or him
who foolishly signed his name to the “ Essay
on Liberty,” becoming the Chief of a Great
Nation, while the talented person who know
Lily Langtry and speared pigs in India
was looking for a job. This train of thought
is not pleasant to follow. Why, if Chaucer
or Shakespeare, Milton, Dryden, Addi-
1 son, Johnson, Gibbon, Buckle, or DTsrasw

were alive to-day one of them might be
chosen as the “ ideal man ” in opposition to
Albert Edward (God bless him)! The
thought, as we said, is not reassuring. We
might be led further—and suppose —purely
for the sake of illustration—that the able
person who wrote the Echo article might
be chosen. But enough. Even in specula-
tion, however free, there should be a well-
defined limit.

This is the reason why Monarchy is making
its way in the world and Republicanism and
Democracy declining. The two latter have
had afair trial—a trial of over 100 years—and
their weak point to-day is just the same as
it was a century ago—the uncertainty*
unlike Monarchy, of finding the “ideal
man.”
A Nut Cracked.
It is very gratifying to know that an intelli-
gent interest in social problems is increasing
throughout Australia. Scarcely a mail ar-
rives without bringing us notes of encourage-
ment, of inquiry, or of challenge—all wel-
come, as showing that people’s minds are
awakened. To answer or even notice all
would equally exceed our industry and our
space. However, here is a specimen letter
“Inre your article, ‘The Duke and the Printer,’
will you please answer the following questions, If
possible. In your next:—1st, Is Henry George rich
or poor? Sod, Who gets the money for the sale of
the books,; ‘Progress and Poverty’? 3rd, If he
makes a fortune by the sale of his books, is he
ready to distribute It ? 4th, Is it not a paradox for
a man to write In his style and at the same time to
try to make money for other poor mea to spend,
if ne believes no one man should hold what h§ has
received by work and brains ? My opinion. Mr.
Editor, although I am a 1 Democrat ’ myself, if mat
Mr. George would be a Duke of Argyll to-morrow
if he could exchange places, but the change of
blood would reverse the ability.—Yours, &o., C.A.”
We are unable to satisfy our correspondent’s
curiosity as to Mr. George’s circumstances.
We should think he must have made a good
deal of money by his books and other writ-
ings ; but we are not sure. As the enormous
success of his great work, ‘‘Progress and
Poverty,” was not foreseen, and it was pub-
lished in the United States, which have no
reciprocity of copyright with European
countries, it is quite likely that Mr. George
derived no benefit from the millions of copies
published in England and other European
countries. This is all we can say about the
questions I and 2, save that a “ biographical
sketch” of Henry George has just been
issued. *
• • **
With regard to the remaining questions,
our correspondent unconsciously plays the
role of “the intelligent Zulu.” Like the
native whose simple honest criticisms set
Bishop Colbnso’s intellect to work to re-
solve problems which, in various forms,
had long exercised the reason of mankind,
“C.A.” propounds queries which have al-
ready engaged attention and which await
definite solution. Our correspondent will,
perhaps, be surprised to be told that his
questions indicate a Socialistic frame of
mind. That is to say that the English
Socialist organs'deal didactically with what
he puts interrogatively. We referred to
this very matter in our first article, “ What
is Socialism ?” in The Bulletin of August
30. The following is the passage : —
R“In a recent English publication, we observe a
Socialist writer remarks:—‘I object to Henry
George, not because ho is a Socialist, but because
he is 'not a Socialist.’ The objection to George
seems to be that he halts on the threshold of neces-
sary reform, and, while offering a genuine remedy
for some of the evils of existing society in his
Elan for national appropriation of all land rentals,
e errs in insisting that his remedy is a panacea—a
cure for all social evils. The thorough-going
Socialist contends that, while George's remedy
for the evils of landlordism is effectual for those
evils, there remain unhealty relations between
Capital and Labour which would still disorder the
entire body politic, even with the cancer of land-
monopoly extirpated.”
. * •
Our correspondent appears not to have
observed this distinction. George draws a
sharp distinction between property in land,
and all other kinds of property. Even the
Socialist writers do not argue that a man
may not hold what he has earned by work
and brains, provided always that he
has not used his brains to take unfair
advantage of other men, so as to
compel them to contribute to his purse
from what their labour produces. There is
no inconsistency, therefore, between Mr.
George’s theory and his practice, even
though he make a fortune by his book. A
fortune derived from a book is certainly
the most defensible sort of fortune, because
no one can positively fix the value received
by each reader. Wisdom is beyond price.
The loftiest ideal of the Socialists is touched
in this very matter. It is that the greatness
of soul which should accompany great in-
tellectual qualities should indispose a man
to desire more than his necessary share of
the means of subsistance in return for his
teachings of philosophy or his creations of
beauty. The author, the artist, the inventor,
are the hardest nuts that Socialist theorists
have to crack.
We have just received Gilbert’s New
South Wales Sporting Annual for 1884. A cursory
glance through it is sufficient to show that, to be
original for once, it will supply a long felt want.
It is an unassuming volume, but the information
it contains regarding out-door sports will be found
invaluable. The synopsis alone of the season s
matches will be ot the greatest service to the
sporting confraternity.

PLAIN ENGLISH.
Ministerial Responsibility.
When the people get a good law on the Statute
Book, they appear to think that good consequences
will follow without any further exertion. The
energy and watchfulness which characterised their
attitude while the question was under discussion
pass away when the legislative settlement arrives.
But the good administration of a law with faults
Is better than the indifferent administration of a
perfect law. As a rule, it is not bad laws so much
as moderately good laws badly administered the
people have now-adays to fear. Energy and
watchfulness should therefore be directed upon
the methods of administration just as much as
upon legislation itself. If the Education Act be
regarded, it would be interesting to discover how
many out of the community know how some of
its most essential principles are worked. Although
there is more talk about other [clauses of the Act,
those bearing upon the intellectual condition of
the pupils are of the most Importance to all out-
side party camps. To whom shall we go fur an
authoritative answer to any question on this head ?
Is there in the Department an administrative mind
capable of directing a uniform measure of scrutiny
and of assimilating and reproducing for the public,
judgments worth the paper they are printed on ?
In theory, some such duty as that falls to the Minis-
ter. In practice, the Minister lets it slide. In this
colony, the Minister for Public Instruction makes
no pretensions to hold in hand the administration
of the system. In Victoria, the portfolio is hustled
into the hands of any member of the Cabinet not
otherwise full up; and when he gets tired, he drops
it Into the desk of some other colleague. In
Queensland, the Minister began the report of last
year’s proceedings by observing that he knew
nothing about the workings of the system, but he
was sure his competent under-secretary did. In
New South Wales there has not been even an
under-secretary for the last twelve months. Is
there not humbug somewhere in this! state of
things ? It is a fact that the school inspectors have
the essential part of the Act wholly in their own
hands. For his district, each inspector is in this
essential the Minister. In this essential, there are
as many Ministers as inspectors. Their methods
are unlike, and who is there to prune and put to-
gether ? Their judgments vary, and who is there
to compare and combine ? The Australian public
should note well the revelations that have come
out under the London School Board. Inspectors
wore entrusted with large powers, and the report
of last year’s work shows that these gentlemen were
conspicuously unreliable in as far as enabling the
Board to form a judgment on the intellectual
condition of the children under their control. For
some time the Board thought it would come to be
necessary to dispense with inspectors altogether.
The work of the inspectors during the latter
half of last year, especially, is likely to
bring that point up for reconsideration. Pay-
ment by results Is an Important feature under
the Board, and it is found that the recommenda-
tions of the inspectors are unintelligible on any
basis of common-sense. If they throw dice as to
what marks to dispense, the result could not have
been more whimsical. Some members of the
Board call the recommendations idiotic, while
others trace them to “ individual idiosyncracles.’’
The fact is that there should bo an active guiding
spirit to superintend inspectoral work. There is
not that in Australia. The general Inspector is no
more than a summarlser or recorder of the
opinions of bis subordinates, the under-secretary
is no more than a registrar of this record, and the
Minister is no more than a reciter of a few words
written on a piece of paper. The only people in
the Department who work educationally are the
teachers. Right up from the teachers, if we ex-
clude the jumbling work of the inspectors, the
work could be performed by boys. Never-
theless, the farce is annually gone through
of issuing a report of the results of edu-
cation each year, the report being signed
by a Minister, who knows nothing except
through his under-secretary, who knows nothing
except through his inspector-general, who know 8
nothing except through his district-inspectors,
who, on a not unfavourable sample, are pro-
nounced idiotic or endowed with a plenitude of
idiosyncrasies. The Minister for Public Instruc-
tion should be a reality. He alone is responsible
for the conduct of the Department. He dis-
honours himself by being the tool of his under-
secretary, or of any other subordinate. The public
don’t know his under-secretary or the others, and
don’t want to know them. But they know that
an Intelligent Minister, with capacity for his office
and a determination to discharge thoroughly the
duty he assumes, will permeate his subordinates
with a healthy vigour which will elicit sympathy
in every part of the system. They know, too, that
a Minlstei who will let himself be worked by those
below him is the worst kind of a humbug with
which the education of the country can be ridden.
So Simple!
Much 'clamour continues to bo made about the
necessity for religious instruction In the Public
Schools of the colony. We conceive that the con-
tention which is going on regarding this might be
put an end to, could the opposing parties but
agree to a definition of what is essentially religious
instruction. There really exists common ground*
ample to accomodate all parties. It will be uni-
versally conceded that whatever instruction
trains the young to practice truthfulness, pitiful-
ness, and Integrity is distinctly religious. And
If a National system could but successfully
train the young to adopt these virtues as their
rule through life, it will have accomplished
what every system, by whoever conducted, and
by whatever sect adopted, has hitherto failed—
notoriously failed—to do. Now, It requires no
revelation from Heaven to convince tne uncor-
rupted mind of childhood that truthfulness is
noble, that charity is elevating, and that Integrity
is splendid. These are all natural truths, to which
every sound mind—not corrupted by evil habits—
responds instinctively. There needs neither the
sanction of supernatural revelation, nor the
lurid terrors of a horrible Hell, to induce young
people to believe to the very bottom of their
hearts, that these things are of eternal verity, and
| that to neglect them 1$ to 99qrt self-coptempt and
1 deformity of soul.
Human Flesh and Human Spirit.
“ Where,” asks a lady writing to a London paper,
“is that old English heroism gone, which used to
teach our sons to die like men ? In the crew of
the Mignonette we see a fearful picture of civili-
sation, Christianity, humanity, all going down
before the instincts of the savage.” The lines
quoted suggest a train of thought which seems to
have been little noticed in the present contro-
versy. Given the pressing physical necessity of
the period, where among the yacht’s crew was
the noble emulation of old Rome or old England
to be the one to be sacrificed for the rest ? Perhaps
the law does not make a crime of the act of that
captain who, while still sane, appealed to the gods
ere he wolflshly stole the life-blood of his dying
boy; but we should be glad to see that public
opinion knew well how to distinguish such a deed
from virtue. In days of old, the captain “left the
ship last,” and perhaps died for his men; and such
brave deeds have been done by modern captains
too, whose children were left a priceless legacy of
valour, and whose lamenting wives gloried in the
heroism of the dead. It is not given to all men to
be heroes, nor yet to every woman has there been
given the spirit of that Spartan mother who, as
she buckled the sword on her last remaining son,
adjured him to “face the foe and never turn in
flight.” But, while we extend to Captain Dudley
that mercy which, had we been in his awful posi-
tion, most of us might have had to demand for
ourselves, let us, even if we overlook the long list
of real and fictitious human heroes, from Roman
Horatius who “ kept the bridge,” to the English
Sydney Carton who died for his friend, and in the
tumbril on his way to the guillotine took the
hand ot the poor little sewing-girl, and told her
“to be not afraid ” —let us not forget the sublime
conception of the God who gave up His life for
the Redemption of the world. Let us, while ex
cuslng the Mignonetie’s captain because he was
weak, never forget that ho took a life committed
to his care—a life for which he might have poured
forth his own blood, and, in so doing, have left a
name unsurpassed In heroism by any of the men
who in modern days, or in days of yore, have died
under the brave old British flag. That Is the ideal.
We believe that England yet has sons, who, to
save their comrades, would willingly volunteer to
“ walk the plank ” or cut an artery, just as for the
love of country they would die in “ the red
squares ” or rush towards the muzzles of the guns.
Let us pardon Captain Dudley. But let us re-
member that Dudley is a proud English name,
and that its bearer should, when facing death,
try to emulate the gods, not sink Into a vulture.
The discussion on the subject of the recent
seizure of books, Including some philosophical
treatises, as immoral and obscene, has been illu-
minated by a contribution to the Dubbo Dispatch
from a Mr. H. L. C. Scotson, of Marebone. We find
much pleasure in giving additional currency to
this emanation from Mr. Scotson's pen, were it
only because the talented author affords evidence
of an acquaintance with the English language
which places him quite on an equality with that
distinguished C.M.G. and UtUraleur, Jannery
John. Mr. Scotson observes;—“Sir, I am (as I
feel Avill all right-minded neople be) delighted a
raid has been made on these Augean stables of
filth—these cesspits of impurities coming to our
eyes as ‘something lively’ od infinitum," and
the chip of Latin proves that ho is as much a classic
as an English scholar. The sentence leaves a
pleasing doubt as to what "ad infinitum” (to
infinity) applies-the raid or cesspits. But it is
perhaps chiefly in command of the English lan-
guage that Mr. Scotson shines. He remarks:—
“I do not think thete Is a more parallel vice
—I do not think there is a more baneful influ-
ence to the minds of young people than the read-
ing a class of literature vicious and disgusting.”
A “ parallel vice ” is, indeed, to be shunned. We
don’t know exactly what a parallel vice may be,
but we presume it is. the opposite of an unparal-
leled vice. We trust, therefore, that every reader
of Mr. Scotson's plain words of warning will shun
parallel vices and be careful to stick to unparal-
leled ones. As Mr. Scotson goei on to demon-
strate:—“ We cannot be too careful to stop, at its
commencement, the spread of any infectious
disease, to nip at the root, and to nip so soundly
that the cancer of corruption—the stink of dead
bodles-be entirely removed.” There is true wis-
dom in this monition. If there be one thing which
the rising generation should, more than another,
be trained to practice, it is to nip a stink at the
root. It is a difficult art, but evidently Mr. Scot-
son would not recommend it unless he were him-
self an expert at it. Ard that proves that it is
easier to acquire than a knowledge of grammar
and composition— arts which apparently have de-
fied the genius of the accomplished Scotson.

The Mudir of Dongola has been made a Knight of
the order of St. Michael and St. George as a re-
ward for his loyalty. This is much as though
George HI had knighted General Arnold for his
loyalty when during the American War of In-
dependence he betrayed and deserted the national
cause. The Mudir of Dongola was, during the
earlier period of the Soudan trouble, seriously
suspected of patriotism. Later, however, he
elected to side with the foreign invaders, and has
done the British as good service a« Baliol
[rendered the English when they over-ran Scot-
land. This ill-starred Order of S3. Michael and
George sinks steadily into deeper contempt.
It seems to be regarded as the refuse-box of de-
coration dispensers, whence gilded offal is thrown
to dirty dogs. Having bestowed an order upon
the most distinguished traitor to his country in
Egypt, always excepting that cur the Khedive,
who is also gnawing a Michael and George bone,
the next natural progression will be to bestow
Companionships of the debased order upon our
most effective native spies and most influential
deserters. The Englishmen whe hereafter accepts
a decoration of this order, will trumpet .forth his
own lack of self-respect. It is no longer a distinc-
tion—it is a degradation. Its star isthe broad-arrow
among decorations.


VANITY FAIR.
The way London mobs crowded them,
convinced Tawhaio and his suite that they were lu
a highly civilised country. One -lay the King’s
cousin To Tuhi, noticed that actors look different
when off and on the t tage. “ Ah,” he said, “they
disguise. Let us.” So Te Tuhi got cosmetics,
filled up the tatoo furrows, and put the tint of the
rose on his delicate cheeks. His first appearance
in th° streets afterwards, however, proved that
he hadn’t quite mastered the art of disguise. So
Te Tuhi is fetching the cosmetic apparatus out for
Mrs T.T., who will no doubt manage better ...The
champion verdict has just been delivered by a
coroner’s jury m Tennessee: “That the said infant,

When the Tennessee jurymen get a little older,

with .blue eyes and rather handsome His wife is
30, and in face and figure one of the most beautiful

of his three years’ absence, she wore mourning for
him, but yet never believed him dead—In
Washington, numbers of lady clerks and busi-
ness women use the tricyde as an ordinary thing
every day; and two ladles side by side on a sociable
is a common sight in the streets.. .Silk is little
worn in Paris, wool having mostly displaced it. At
the Grand Prix, nearly all the lovely dresses were
woollen. Merino is now made in such lovely
colours and quality that aristocrats wear it even
on dressy occasions. On the afternoon promenade,
women walk in very short dresses with immense
bustles, and with very pretty clocked stockings of
a colour unlike the dress. They drive in short
dresses, and show the feet very much. It is doubt-
ful whether this is a pretty fashion, as a short
dress never looks well when a woman sits down.

They were conducting that formal talk which
strangers treat one another to during heavy
dinners, when seeing a freckled face, he observed:
" Look at that spotted man: did you ever see such
a face ? ’ The ladv coldly made reply: " Yes; that
is my husband.” And the wretch said: “ Oh, how
jolly, you know, because you can tell me—is he
really spotted all over ?’ ... Ldu Hurst, the strong

He’d better behave.. Christine Nilsson has reached a

Says the Argonadt: —" New York and Boston are
full of American dudes, who dress in the English
style, speak as if they had hot potatoes in their
mouths, wear a glass in one eye, part their hair in
tue middle, wear bob-tailed coats indelicately
short behind, and imitate the English in all their
puppy airs.” Rather a rasp for the lovely beings
who pride themselves on representing “the pro-
duct of 700 years of civilisation.”....Going througn
a warehouse the other day, she exclaimed; “Oh,
do weigh me. please,” and, as she stepped on the
platform and shook out her Mother Hubbard skirt
—all flounced and puffy, you know, and utterly
misleading—the storeman glanced at her general
outline and put 10 stone on the lever. The weivht
came down with a suddenness that scared him.
Then he tried a cvt. “ Must be something wrong,"
he observed, as it went down plop- Finally he
got her balanced, and. as she tripned off, with her
total avoirdupois registered at 781b., he looked
after her full md finely-rounded figure, and
muttered dubiously: “ Some young feller will get
awfully taken in with that Mother Hubbard
dress.” There are regular female bookmakers
on the Longchamps and other French racecourses...
A young wife, tax' d by her husband with forget-
ting the “obey” she had uttered in the marriage
service, protested t hat she was in such a daze at
the time that she couldn’t remember a word she
had said. And mentioning this peculiar circum-
stance to several of his married friends, he found,
curiously enough, that all their wives had suffered
from exactly the same kind of nervousness .A
telegraph company at Washington has prohibited
its girl clerks from wearing Mother Hubbard
dresses under threat of dismissal. The sack
couldn’t be much worse than those baggy things.
The youthful heir to much property, on hear-
ing of the death of his chum’s father, began to
mop his eyes. “ Yes, I know you sympathise ”
observed his friend. “ Oh, no, it's not that,” re-
plied the affected youth; “only—only, you know
—everybody's father seems to die but mine!” ...
Theo, the beautiful|actress, when the has dressed,
takes delight in viewing herself in a mirror. Some
ladies delight to practise the mirror viewing with-
out the preliminary trouble... Only last month,
the first lawn tennis club was started in 'Frisco—
Long Branch is the scene of the American beauty
show every summer—the happy hunting ground
of the single girls. In the mornings, dowagers
roll by in the landaus and broughams, rejuvenating
in the fresh country air. But it is in the after-
noon those bits of bric-a-brao, their daughters,
come out to carry on their campaign, and show
their symmetry at the popular lawn-tennis, done
up in some dainty marvel of the latest style of
frocks It is a mistake to suppose that Mrs.
Maokay is always very richly dressed. It is only
on State occasions she is elaborate. At her own
home, she prefers black, and is often without
even diamonds A few English girls have tried
the divided skirt for lawn tennis, but as they wear
an overskirt nearly to its hem. it's difficult to see
where they gain anything. But, then, there are a
lot of things you can’t see — He had just had a
close crop, and visiting his best suburban girl that
evening, he observed pleasantly : “Now, I s’pose,
you’ll call attention to the size of ray ears ?” “ Oh,
no,” she replied with cheerful smile, “there’s no
need to do that, Dolf.” Why a woman can’t
bathe in anything less than thick heavy folds
of unsightly flannel, while she can attend opera in
a gauze bodice that seems afraid to go near her
shoulders—is one of those mysteries that man
quails to investigate. Now, what's the matter?
In Washington, two men go about on bicycles,
with parasols to shade them from the sun — A
clock has been made in Moscow to run 400 days—
Mrs. Langtry’s power lies mainly in the fact that
she is well sexed—that is to say, she is very much
of a woman. She is thoroughly feminine, on a
large scale; she is possessed of a lithe, flexible
figure, a flue constitution, good health, which she
wisely retains by long walks in the open air. Her
skin is fair, but not thin nor oven sensitive.. 1 he

Beneath a shady tree they sat,
He held her hand, she held his hat,
I held ray breath and lay right flat;
They kiss id—I saw them do it.
He held that kissing was no crime,
She held her head up every time.
I held rav pence, and wrote this rhyme,
While they thought no one knew it.
A curious monthly magazine is the “Shut In
Visitor.” It is published entirely for sick people,
and circulates among those who can never go out
to see one another and the world — Recently, the
first sale at Adelaide was held of ostrich feathers
grown in the colony, some fetching 15s. each. The
leathers are not the only things grown there—the
husbands groan, too A girl wanted by the
police was arrested in Melbourne, disguised as an
old woman. But old women disguised as girls are
still going about.
Said a Kentish clergyman from the pulpit
on a recent Sunday“There are complaints in
this parish of the smallness of the hop crop. We
need not go far for the reason. It is through
farmers absenting themselves from this church.
There are only three farmers to-day amongst my
congregation/’ The three farmers who attended
considered they were rather hardly dealt with, as
their crops of hops were no better than those of
their neighbours who frequent the Nonconformist
place of worship. Several hop-growers left the
parish church on account of the obnoxious extra-
ordinary tithe of Ids, per acre levied on their hop
plantations.

Thus a powerful English
Radical journal“ Englishmen
know, by name, a certain ex-
Colonel Valentine Baker, a
cashiered officer, convicted by a
legal tribunal of a dastardly
offence against the honour of an
unprotected girl. There can be
no doubt that the ‘General’
and the cashiered ex-Colonel are
one and the same man. The
question, therefore, is how the
person who was drummed from
the army got back again ? How
la it, too, that Valentine Baker
is called a ‘General. English
army rules are most punctilious
In this respect. A soldier serving
the State cannot accept even a
twopenny bronze medal from
a foreign Power without express
permission to do so. Here, how-
ever, we have the anomalous
state of affairs that a man who
was, as the service phrase goes,
• broken,’ who was dismissed
the service of 4 his Queen and
his country,’ not only serving
under the colours again, but
mentioned with foreign rank,
lor the 4 General ’ rank worn
by Baker Is Turkish, and not
English. Had Valentine Baker
been a poor infantry Captain,
he would never have been
heard of again. ,. H ®*. h ® w „®X?fj
belongs to a so-called influential
4 set.’ He Is a boon companion
of the Prince of Wales. He is
known by men whose titles are
by no means the brightest or
least tarnished in the English
peerage. For this —and no other
reason can be alleged—he is
being shoved forward, and it
remains for the people of Eng-
land to protest against any fel-
low of his known and convicted
character having anything to do
with our troops. The sentence
which Valentine Baker served
was a heavy one as it stood,
but In reality it was light. He
could order what food, what
wines, and what books he liked.
His cell was a library and dining-
room in reality, and it is little
lees than monstrous that, incap-
able of feeling shame himself,
he should now thrust himself to
the front, thereby displacing
scores of men of brave and
perfectly unsullied lives. We
should like to know the precise
steps by which Valentine Baker
has been attached to the expedi-
tion. As a disgraced and cash-
iered officer, he cannot legally
serve again, unless the Queen
removes her Interdict. This h as
not been done ; and, further-
more, it could not have been
done without being Gazetted in
due form. How, then, does it
come about that Baker Is 4 ap-
Solnted ’ to the Intelligence
lepartment of the Nile Expedi-
tion? If by fluke or by flaw,
the Job Is alike disgraceful, re-
prehensible, and likely to dam-
age the morale of the army. It
is the most asinine folly to
punish Bob Acres or Dick
Brown, privates in the Guards,
for outrages on women in the
Birdcage-walk, when Valentine
Baker, an officer convicted of an
Infamous attack on a girl in a
railway carriage, and a man who
for a certain period was in gaol,
is lifted over precedent and
martial usage. He might be
invited to an 4 august garden
party.’ That was bad enough.
But the 4 function ’ was merely
a private affair. It did not
concern the nation. When,
however, Baker is made an
officer in an English army,
which, however small, is still
an army, a disgraceful job looks
still blacker. In Germany, much
as we detest its autocratic mili-
tary system, a stainless character
In an officer is indispensable. As
a German, Valentine Baker
would have been drummed out
of his regiment, and branded
with a social disgrace which
must for all life have clung even
to his shadow.”
The indignation of the Queen and others
In England at the Grand Duke of Hesse’s marriage
with Madame de Kalomine “ is regarded in Ger-
many as all the more absurd as, according to Ger-
man law, the marriage of the Princess Louise with
Lord Lome is a morganatic union.”
The Parliament is now to be asked to make
provision for Prince Edward of Wales. Next year

Mediterranean Fleet.
At a recent political meeting the Hon. and
Rev. L. Irby said his nephew. Lord Boston, was
“a very promising pup.” He stated that the
Gladstone Government got into office by “evil
•peaking, lying, and slandering,” and that that
grand old artful dodger, Gladstone, wore high
Shirt-collars to *, hide his infernal cheek.”
A well-dressed humbug called at a London
workhouse and was shown over it by the officials.
He expressed himself as delighted with what he
saw, and on leaving he signed the book “ Teck.”
Now, It happened that Prince Teck at the time was
on the Continent. But the well-dressed fraud had
a sense of the eternal fitness of things. Prince
Teck (alias Prince “ Tick ”) is just now in quite a
fit condition to go to the workhouse.
The Postmaster-General of Victoria was in
a Jocose vein lately, and, looking about for a vent,
he conferred the name of Massey upon a little
village hitherto known as Watchem West. The
poet to whom a photograph of the village was
shown, and the villagers to whom a photograph of
the poet was shown, are both equally disgusted
with Mr. Campbell’s exploit. That is nearly always
the fate of the humorous Scotchman.
Alfred was not at all sure that his funny
man had genuine humour, because he frequently
guessed what the point of the joke was. Noticing
the wag a bit pale one day, and cheering up a bit
on seeing he was losing llesh like the rest of the
staff, he asked what was the matter. The poor
follow complained of loss of appetite Where-
upon Alfred's doubts were sot at rest; and he
raised his salary straight away to thirty shillings a
week.
The World says: 44 Had Sir Robert Morier
been appointed to succeed Lord Ampthiil at
Berlin, his experience would have been that of
Lord Augustus Loftus, who, after he had bored
Bismarck to such an extent that the latter bluntly
refused to see him, bad to be withdrawn.’ We
believe this to be a fowl libel. Ves. It was Lord
Augustus who refused to see Bismarck. How-
ever, any sort of an old gentleman does to govern
an Australian colony.
Hon. Francis George Hay, just dead, had
served before the mast In the navy, and at the
time of his death was an officer in the service of
the British-India Co. He had had varied experi-
ences of life. One night off Aden ho, while on
watch, fancied he saw a boat drift by, and heard a
faint scream. Me stopped the ship, lowered a
boat, and found the dead body of a lady and a liv-
ing child tied together in a boat half-full of water.
The child he adopted, and she is now in the charge
of his family. He was never able to discover her
birth or parentage, or even the name of the vessel
on which she had been a passenger. This sounds
like a chapter from a sensational romance; but
yet it is true.
William Dowell, ex-alderman of Tam-
worth, and future Premier of the Federated
States of Australasia, has shown by pure arith-
metic and native eloquence that four and a half
millions of the railway loan would be profitably
spent in making his house in Peel-street the centre
of a network of railways extending in all direc-
tions from the north pole to the south. By this
means, nearly half a million would be set free to
develope such districts as were likely to become
tributary to Tamworth in the course of time. In
the meantime, Wlliiam, who is a contractor, would
do his best to build culverts and stations that
would reflect honour on the country, and, what is
no object—a few pounds on himself. What says
Alderman Vett ?
It is not generally known that the eldest
son of the late John Mitchel (the celebrated Irish
nationalist who was .transported to Tasmania in
1848, with Dr. O’Doherty, of Brisbane, and others)
was killed by a shell from a Federal war-ship,
among the battered ruins of Fort Sumter,
whose defence had been entrusted to the young
captain of Confederate artillery ? With a handful
of brave men he held and fought the crumbling
batteries of the fort during thirteen days of in-
cessant bombardment; and the memory of his
stubborn defence and heroic acts is yet green
among the people of Charleston, in the beautiful
cemetery pf which qutjiot Southern city he lies
buried under a weeping willow, at his head a
monument commemorating how he fought and
died for the 44 lost cause.”
Vanity Fair has a cartoon of the Hon.
Alfred Lyttleton. the cricketer. He is the eighth
son of the late Lord Lyttleton. The Hon. Alfred
is cricket mad: the late Lord L. was mad, without
the cricket, and It was rumoured that in the hot
weather he used to kill as many as two valets a
quarter. Lord Lyttleton's end was compassed with
a razor, and “ he died much regretted In diplomatic
circles ” The present portrait Is by Pelllgrlni
(“Ape”), and is merely a broad and long caricature.
41 Jehu Junior” concludes an eleven-line par. re-
specting him (and are not eleven lines enough for
any cricketer d eette heureh with the following
characteristic touch:—“It is as one of the lights
of English cricket that he is best known, and espe-
cially as a wicket-keeper. He is considered one of
thebest of the amateur players. He is very popular.
He recently lost his overcoat.”
Dr. Oliver Wendell Holmes, in replying to
the congratulations of many friend*, published In
the Critic on his 75th birthday, said, amongst
other things: “Speak as indulgently as you may
to one who has crossed the dead line of the
Psalmist’s reckoning, he cannot forget that he is
sitting amid the ruins of the generation to which
he belongs - himself a monument, if not a ruin,
on which all hut himself can read the inscription.
Let not the critic weigh too nicely the value of
the praise bestowed upon him. A few year* will
chill and quiet all the excited superlatives which
overweening fondness has lavished in his honour.
In the meantime, a little overpraise comes too late
to do him any great harm. The breath that stirs
his slumbering vanity brightens the fire upon his
hearth, but fans no dangerous flame of self-love,
as it might have done in earlier years. And even
the shrivelled centenarian loves a word of praise—
it is the sweetmeat of his second infancy.”
M. Louis Ducrot, M.D., of West Maitland,
has published a Proclamation (his own phrase) in
the focal paper, to the effect, that it is his “ firm
opinion that Cordini, lately executed for murder
at Denillquln, was innocent of the crime for which
he suffered, and therefore died a judicial martyr.”
This is a very grave charge—all the more so that
it is made by M. Ducrot, whose reputation for
logical acumen and clear-sighted sagacity has
passed into a proverb in the district in which he
dwells. M. Ducrot is naturally sad at the fate of
his departed countryman, but he has taken a
serious responsibility in making his opinion public,
and plunging the jury who tried, and the judge
who condemned, that unfortunate man into the
gloomy gulf of remorse, and maybe into untimely
and ill-constructed coffins. But lf.it were neces-
sary to the peace of mind of M. Ducrot to do so we
have nothing to say. The world would lose too
much by his mind not being at peace to let any
consideration stand in the way of such a consum-
mation. And if this could not be effected without
the warning that wound up his proclamation—
“French colonists should take notice that their
lives are hourly in danger we accept this, too,
with the rest. But we think M. Ducrot should
have specified that the warning was not intended
for his patients. People are so apt to misunder-
stand,
It appears that at last one Australian is
becoming celebrated, and has attained a celebrity
which has reached even America. Sir Henry
Parkes, of course ? Not a bit of it; when Sir Henry
travelled through America, the N. Y. Chamber of
Commerce was moved by some busybodies to
give him a dinner, and the members as a body
took no notice. Marcus Clarke? Pshaw! Marcus had
only genius, and owed Aaron Waxman money.
Sir Dan Cooper ? Not at all. Nobody out of Aus-
tralia ever heard of Sir Dan. See here, now:—
An American newspaper says that 41 Lord Ruperts-
wood. of Victoria, is reported to be richer than
W. H. Vanderbilt. He is worth more than
£40,000,000, and his wealth is rapidly increasing
He inherited a great estate from his father
including millions of cattle and sheep in Au-
stralia. His residence in Melbourne is said to
be the most magnificent in the world. It cost
£800,000.” “Lord Rupertswood” is Sir William
John Clarke, of Rupertswood, the first resident
Australian Baronet, whose father, 44 Big Clarke ”
started as a cattle-dealerin Tasmania, then bought
largely in Victoria, and made great sums by
advances on station property to needy squatters
“ Big Clarke ” was undoubtedly far and away
Australia’s wealthiest son, and lived on about a
fortieth of his income. Sir W. J. Clarke is tre-
mendously rich, and Rupertswood cost a pot of
money; but he is as a minnow to a Triton as
compared financially with "The People be
damned” Vanderbilt.
In England, a woman upon
the death of her husband co-
habited with the husband’s
brother—whom according to
British law she could not
marry—and a son was bern to
the parties. Upon the death of
the natural lather the son
actually went through the legal
process of marrying the mother,
and in the eye of the law became
to all intents and purposes the
legal husband of his own mother.
Three m onths after the marriage
the mother died, leaving all her
belongings to her legal husband,
thereby avoiding the 10 per cent,
legacy duty which would have
been chargeable had she be-
queathed them to the same man
in the person of her illegitimate
son.
Avondale, the home of Mr.
the Irish leader, an unpreten-
tious-looking roomy stone home
of two and a half stories, ig
situated on a gentle slope of the
River Avonmore, in Wicklow.
The large hall, unlike that of
the 44 fine old English gentleman,
all of the olden time,” is hung
around not with pikes, and guns,
and bows, but with odds and
ends of all kinds, immense ant-
lers of the now extinct Irish elk,
ancient spears, shield and am-
our; Canadian snow shoes, and
addresses innumerable from
every city, town, and county in
Ireland. A massive old billiard
table, on which are thrown in a
careless heap several skins of
different animals, one of a Polar
bear brought from America
some years ago, stands in the
middle. The library is particu-
larly interesting with its rare
and goodly collection of old
books; some of them used in
the old Irish House of Commons.
Here, too, may be seen a chest
of polished oak, containing a
complete set of carpenter’s
tools, presented to the Master of
Avondale hy the ladies of Rath-
drum, carpentry being one of
his favourite amusements. In
the old-fashioned drawing-room
abundant evidences are found
of the gratitude and affection
of the Irish at home and abroad.
In one corner of the room is
a beautiful crimson plush arm-
-chair (readily adjusted into
a couch), a gift of the ladies of
Cork ; a pretty rosewood music
box, the present of some Dublin
ladies ; an exquisitely-wrought
casket of silver, gold-lined and
egg-shaped, which was sent a«
an Easter egg, containing 100
guineas, by some of the people of
Liverpool; an eider down, Rile
green satin quilt with a mono-
gram on its centre (another gift
while imprisoned) from the
generous - hearted Liverpool
ladies ; a solid casket of oak
mounted In silver of peculiar
design, which was given by the
people of Limerick with the
freedom of that city: and lastly,
three great emu eggs, sent from
Australia, one each to Miss
Anna, Mrs. Parnell, and Mr. Par-
nell, in recognition of their
devotion to the cause of Irish
nationality. These eggs are set
on pedestals of silver, richly
carved with raised figures of
the wolf dog; round towers,
and other emblems of national
significance, and were brought
over in the care of the Messrs.
Redmond on their return to Ire-
land a few months ago. f r0I “
the windows everywhere may
be had a glorious view of bill
and dale, mountain and vane>,
unsurpassed in grandeur or
beauty. Beautiful drives ami

tractions on this estate of Mr.

berland represents only Sir Hugh Smithson, who
called himself Percy after his wife’s grandmother
or greatgrandmother; and, while the Percies were
satisfied with being Karls, Smithson got George III.
to make hire a Duke. There isln the Anti-Jacobin

“Duke Smithson of Northumberland.”
Mr. William Neil, who was mulcted in £600
nnd afterwards committed for perjury, is a gentle-
man towards whom, if we feel a jy sympathy, it
cannot be said to resemble, to any large extent,
the “quality of mercy.” What we like is chivalry.
We inherited this adoration of the knightly from
G P. R. James, and, we cannot but think, in call-
ing the young lady a story-teller, William’s con-
duct (independent of his other actions) verges
very closely on the brusque But, in denying the
evidence in toto, Mr. Neil has only followed the
ordinary precedent despite the somewhat singular
fact that “on April 21 she (Mary Ann) was con-
fined of a female child, which was taken care of
by the aunt of the defendant.” So far as we are
concerned we have not been in the habit of taking
our aunt into our confidence respecting little mat-
ters of this sort—one reason, probably, being the
dexterity she has acquired in the art of heaving a
saucepan-lid; but, we must proffer in a mild way
a deprecatory protest against the Judge’s ruling.
Why if this sort of thing is to be the order of the
day we shall have no further use for half our pic-
nic tickets.
“Henry Nightingale, or Lord of Himself,”
a novel just published by Chapman and Hall, is a
charming book. The stage is crowded with charac-
ters, who move about in a delightfully unconven-
tional manner. The lawyer kisses his client and
calls her “old girl,” at which point the author
allows that “ there is a tinge of ’ Arry in his na-
ture.” Another follower of the legal profession
masquerades about Leicester-square with hooded
cloak, spectacles, false beard, and fez. The
doctor’s wife addresses her husband with “ Hush,
viper, hush I” Another of the fair sex, in whom
the author can see no vulgarity, “as the word
ought properly to be used,” smokes, drinks un-
limited brandy and soda, and tells her suitor,
“Bertie you are like an awkward waiter; you
cannot manage to get the cork out.” Besides
these, there are some characters of greater refine-
ment who now and then stop at a critical moment
to air a few lines of Alfred de Musset or Heinrich
Heine. Poor Henry Nightingale has many ups
and downs in life, but he comes out of them
victorious as Governor of the Island of Triple
Peaks, and—horrible to relate 1—Knight of the
Order of St. Michael and St. George.
Mr. Dale, the well-known aeronaut, ac-
companied by his wife and a gentleman, has just
had a marrow-freezing balloon adventure. The
party ascended at Edinburgh on September 20.
The day was misty, and soon after hi# ascent Dale
found they were steadily sailing along, the party
being scarcely able to recognise each other, owing
to the density of the fog. When it became clear
that they were drifting towards the German Ocean,
he lowered the balloon 1000 feet. It then seemed
certain that a descent must be made on the water.
A steamer was seen, but it took no notice of the
mronauts, and a sailing vessel also passed without
attempting any assistance. Ultimately a steamer,
four miles off, was seen making for the endangered
balloonists. The balloon was now kept close to the
water, but it was driven faster than the steamer,
and the car struck the water with great force, and
beeame nearly submerged. The occupants were
drenched by being dragged after the balloon,
which rolled very much. Ultimately the steamer
got near to the balloon, and a boat was lowered—
the most welcome sight, Dale says, he had seen for
years. The party are little the worse, but the bal-
loon was seriously damaged.
The following is the grog score of an un-
lucky navy lieutenant recently court-martialled
In England for “drunkenness:”—“Aug. 13, Three
and a half glasses of brandy, one bottle of ale, and
five minerals; 14, five and a half glasses of brandy,
one bottle of ale, and six mineral waters; 15, one
glass of sherry, ten glasses of brandy, one bottle of
ale, and nine mineral waters; 16, one glass of port,
ten and a half glasses of brandy, and eleven mine-
ral waters; 17, one glass of sherry, two of port,
nine and a half of brandy, and nine mineral waters;
18 one and a half of brandy, two bottles of ale, and
three mineral waters.” The lieutenant was found
guilty, and dismissed his ship. The English race
must surely be degenerating in the auld countree,
for up north of this continent there are lots of
people who would consider the foregoing just
about half enough to begin the day on. Here is an
episode from a recent naval court martial. Prisoner
called bis servant, an ancient mariner, for the de-
fence’—“Did you see me in my cabin at about a
quarter to eleven on the night of the 23rd ?—I did.
Was I drunk or sober ?—You was sober. A pause.
Then a member of the court: Are you quite sure
he was sober ?—Yes, sir, he was puffectly sober,
and left orders to be called early in the morning.
Another pause. Then the president of the court:
Did he assign any reason for wishing to be called
early ?—Yes, sir; he said he was to be Queen of the
May.” The officer was not acquitted.
Thomas Jones is the rather unpretentious
professional name of the new tight-rope performer
who made such a successful debut and created
such a furore by his scientific and dexterous
strangling of the late Mr. William O’Bnen in Mel-
bourne Gaol on the 27th ult. Mr. Jones is a man
of about fifty years of age, strong and tall, wears
his whiskers d la Imperial, and taking him on the
whole—or the drop-is altogether a far superior
man to his predecessor, Mr. Upjohn. He was
taken from his home at Pentndge (where he has
resided for many years) on trial, solely for the
purpose of giving Mr. O’Brien a really good and
comfortable send-off to the land of the Great un-
known. O’Brien made no statement as he stepped
along, merely taking a bushman’s look at the sky,
and remarking that he “thought we d have ram
before night,” and in less than half a minute from
the time he emerged from his cell hewaj dangling
(as the Nooze carefully tells us) “a lifeless corpse.
We are not well posted in the usual business of
executions, but we notice that considerable stress
is laid on the fact that on the occasion of Mr.
O’Brien’s abrupt departure, Mr. Jones thought-
fully “soaped the rope.” This, we believe, is a
luxury not usually allowed to the gentleman on
the drop; and, therefore, Mr. Jones s little atten-
tion shows that he possesses a kind and feeling
heart. We wish him every success in his new
career, and are pleased to find he takes such an in-
terest in his new profession. As Cicero once re-
marked, “No office can give dignity to a man; but
it is in the power of a man to give dignity to any
office.” Mr. Upjohn has got the bullet, and in
all probability will now enlist in the Salvation
Army or cross over to this colony and glide into
the world of politics.
James Brennen, of Anvil Creek, has been
hammering out a chant for the Coalopolitan
Haney, about the kid who was recently lost in
the bush at Mlnmi, and discovered (per favour of
a dream that God vouchsafed to a local maiden)
near dark Dog Hole, encamped in a hollow log.
•lames is pretty fair at description, but tis when
he hymns the moral or wakes the religious senti-
ment that he deserves the bun. Here is the gem
of the pome—
•“ At length all hopes were beginning to die,
As no one thought he could live so long;
.But o’er him still was the watchful Bye
Of Him who shieldeth the weak and strong.
‘Yes, every moment that Eye was there,
Watching each winding step he trod:
'Charley, whenever you join in prayer,
You should bless the Eye and the Hand of
God! ”
‘ That “ blessing the eye ” is a pleasant ringing the
■change on a less reverent optical remark. James
winds up with the conundrum “ Was it mother or
child who suffered the most ?”—which, before we
• essay to answer, we should like to know the size
of her foot and thickness of her slipper. When
the heir was lost (in Hood’s truthful ballad) bis
mama declared, “I’d give the whole wide world,
if the world was mne, to clap my two longm eyes
on his face, for he’s my darlin’ cf darlins, and it he
don’t soon come back, you’ll see me drop stone
* dead on the place. I only wish I’d got him sate m
1 hese two motherly arms, and wouldn 11 hug him
and kiss him.” But when the heir was twigged
brought back, the maternal note was changed
to: “But let me get him home, with a good grip
of his hair, and I’m blest if he shall have a whole
bone in bis skin 1” Such is life I
Some “Earthmen,” strange little beings
from the Kalahari Desert, in the African interior,
have arrived in London. These small people pre-
fer to sleep in the sand, regardless how many lions,
tigers, and other beasts of prey may be reposing,
or even restlessly wandering around them. It is
only in the rainy season that they seek shelter, and
then they steal it: for, driving out hordes of ants
from some hill they have made, a whole family
will pack themselves therein. The head of the
family in London is N’co N’qui (captain or chief),
aged 35, and measuring 4ft. 6in. N’arbecy, his
wife, i< five years older and half an inch taller.
This worthy and evidently affectionate couple are
said to be a giant and giantess in their own
ountry. The remaining four consist of N’flni
N'fom (the chief’s favourite dancer), aged 34, and
4ft. lin. high ; N’co, a humorous and fearless
youth of similar height; N’icy (whose name is sug-
gestive of burlesque), a pleasing little girl, aged 13;
andN’arki, son of N’oo [and N’arbeoy, an infant
with a charmingly-shaped mouth and a fascinating
smile. N’arki, though six years of age, has to be
still nursed by his fond and most attentive mother;
indeed, according to the habits of Earth-infants, it
would seem that N’arki has still two years of his
suckling period to run. Their limited oral con-
versation is of a most uncouth and clicking kind.
The chief describes, by means of appropriate
snorts, shrieks, puffs, and symptoms of nausea,
his rail and ocean journey to London, being really
clever. The “ family ” also show how they “ make
up ” as ostriches, and ingeniously imitate the
ways of those birds in order to stalk them success-
fully on their native heath, which is sand. Though
Nature has not been liberal to these little people
in the way of noses, she has given them singularly
lithe and graceful figures, and hands and feet of
exceptional beauty and softness.
George Leybourne—“ old ” George Ley-
bourne—as the motley crew styled by courtesy
“music-hall artists,” reverently called him, has
run his earthly course. The pace has killed, and
the lion comique ” has dropped out of the track.
This item of news will revive memories of youth-
ful giddiness in the breasts of men who are now
almost old colonials, for it’s something like twenty
years ago since the “Great George Leybourne’'
invented a new type of music hall business, and.
dazzled half drunken audiences with the splendid
Impudence and audacious inanity of his so-called
“songs.” More than one respectable Sydney
paterfamilias will heave an incidental sigh as he
recalls the keen delight with which he listened to
‘Champagne Charlie,’ in his young days “at
home," and marvel, perhaps, “ that he could ever
have sat out such rot.” But there he does the
defunct comique an injustice. However mean
may be the music-hall performers craft, there can
be masters of that as of all other crafts, and the
first among the masters was Ley bourne. The way in
which he kept going for years after his constitution
was completely broken down by dissip ation, was
astound! g to all who knew Anything >of the man
“ off.” Fellow “ pros,” encountering George at
familiar daytime haunts, looked at his long
emaciated figure, palsied hands, and gl azed eyes
with a kind of pitiful awe, and wond ered how
such a living; corpse could continue to take his
turn at three or four halls nightly. Possibly the
poor beggar himself wondered most of all. At a
supper given in his honour, some three or four
years back, Leybourno made a pathetic little
allusion to his follies—“‘Champagne Charlie’
made me, and Champagne Charlie’s Ikilled me,”
said he. That was unfortunately true; but of
other vices, so rife among men of his stamp,—Ley-
bourne had not more than his share, while his
generosity and willingness to do a good turn to
any of his struggling brethren, were proverbial.
Behind the gaudy waistcoat of the flash music-hall
cad beat a heart which might (be trams planted to
the breast of plenty of men occupying v ery proud
positions, without any detriment to the now
owner.
Mrs. Mackay, wife of the American “ Bo-
nanza King,” is the daughter of very humble
Iiarents in a Californian mining village. She got
ittle education, and while very young married a
poor druggist who bequeathed his bad constitution
to their only child -the daughter whose ongage-
ment to Prince Colonna was recently announced.
When her husband died, the lady who is now Mrs.
Mackay started a boarding-house in the rough
West. John Mackay, who had recently risen; from
a poor miner to the possession of a rich lead mine,
was told one day that the widow So-and-so was in
very destitute circumstances and that she did not
even have respectable shoes to wear; and without
ever having seen her, he had the generosity to send
her some wood and some flour. She wrote him a
touching letter of thanks, by which he was made
to feel so much interested in her that he called to
see her. In a short time they were married. He
made money as if by magic, and soon built a
palatial residence. Fortune contin ued to smile on
him, until he was worth $40,000,000, when he left
Virginia City and went over to Paris, where he
secured a town and a country residence. As soon as
Mrs. Mackay was properly Installed, having in the
meantime got a fair knowledge of the French
language, she began that demonstrative career of
which the rejection of her portrait, painted by
Meissonier, was but a single incident. It Is easy
enough to see how such a woman might have a
loud and coarse voice, or have some other evi-
dences of a lack of early refinement; and it is from
those of Mrs. Maekay’s tribe that foreign writers
take their cue when they want to say nasty things
about American women. It seems that there is no
immediate prospect of the marriage of the so-
called Miss “ Mackay.” Mrs. Mackay seems to feel
It incumbent on her to have this same information
scattered abroad at regular periods of about six
months. As related above, Miss Eva Mackay is
really an invalid. It is not probable that she will
evenmarry, for that reason, as her malady is of a
very serious character. She is pathetic-looking
and not pretty, and there are few men who would
select so pale and delicate a creature for a wife, if
she did not have millions for a dowry She is of a
most retiring nature, does not ‘‘go into society,”
and is an ardent devotee to the R.C. religion. It is
considered more than likely that in the long run
she will enter a convent.
J. Henniker Heaton is now proceeding
through Europe iu a perfect hurricane of glory.
Kings are his ordinary boon companions, and
Crown Princes his cronies. He has shown off be-
fore as many crowned heads as a prestidigitateur,
and, probably, with as much, if not more, ap-
plause. The ordinary ruck of the aristocracy he
does not associate with. One must draw the lino
somewhere. With the generosity which has
always characterised him—an invariable attribute
of high breeding and noble blood—he does not for-
get his old friends in the days of his greatness, but
sheds some of his g ory on the humble and home-
staying Alfred, who has never seen a King—
except in a pantomime. To Alfred, then, he
writes from the capital of Denmark, and Alfred
bejewels his columns with the letter. Ho begins
his glittering screed, does Henniker, with the
modest statement that, as he has “twenty minutes
to spare ” (great creature I what a gorgeous popu-
larity he must have, to have so little time on hand 1)
he will devote those golden moments to his old
friend. It seems a small enough concession, con-
sidered in the abstract, but, as coming from Hen-
niker, it is a condescension to be proud of. We
regret and exult in the opening sentence: “The
London season proved too much for perfect
health, and ft was necessary to fly.” We regret
because of his health (that precious life I), and
exult to think what a dazzling series of successes
the admission. Implies. “ So,” he goes on to say,
in the gleaming sentences for which he is noted.
‘‘Norway and Sweden were decided upon.'
Happy Norway and Sweden 1 And, being on the
way to Norway and Sweden, he could hardly do
lees than call upon his friend the King of Denmark
and the Koyal Family. This naturally led to an
invitation to stay and meet the members of the
International Congress then being held in Copen-
hagen, some of whom were almost as illustri-
ous in their way as he—that is Henniker. Of
course he had no sooner made an appearance at
the Congress, than he was promptly and enthusi-
astically elected an honorary member. Professor
Pasteur (the most prominent physicist of the day)
did himself the honour of proposing him. Here
Henniker is kind enough to diverge from his
subject for a moment, and give us some informa-
tion about Pasteur. He says Pasteur has not yet
found a man who will agree to be inoculated with
hydrophobia. Pasteur and he became great pals
Heavens I a horrible thought flashes across us I
What if Pasteur ?—but, no 1 Pasteur has feelings;
Pasteur has sympathies: he could not, dare not,
be so cruelly cold-blooded as to have hydrophobia
designs upon Henniker. He would remember
(Pasteur) that Henniker is the hope of this great
country: that without Henniker we should—ah,
what should we do ? And Alfred—poor Alfred, he
would mildew into the tomb. He would put ashes
upon his head, and once more cut down the salaries
of his reporters. Let us here whisper a prayer
that the heart of Pasteur may be softened, and
that Henniker may be spared to us. ... We have
whispered it, and it has soothed us. We can now
go on to whore he gives us a pleasant synopsis of the
songs of the three Danish poets-laureates-(ThrceI
what a country it must be for liquor I)-composed
specially in honour of the occasion. The first
song, he says, pleasantly begins “ by asking the
visitors to see Denmark and enjoy her fresh air
playing on their lungs.” There is a lyric rapture
about this conception that marks the author as a
bard who would shed almost at much lustre on the
jERNEnashe would receive from that luminary
of literature. We have not space to quote what
Henniker said about the Sapas of the other scalds,
but we have no doubt they will make him the hero
of a new Edda—(oh, a gay old philologic bird are
wel)—if he pushes the wassail-bowl about with a
fairly free hand. We can only find room for an
exulting reference to the refulgence- the steam of
splendour—which enveloped Henniker when he
rose majestically up from the prismatic platform.<
and, to use his own memorable words, “found
myself, as an Englishman, far and away the moat
popular, particularly when I thanked them for
giving us the Princess of Wales." This delicate
implication of an acquaintance with the daughter
of their King, and intimation that he approved of
her style, must have endeared him to the hearts of
his hearers. No upstart or parvenu— at least, none
that we have ever seen, or heard, or road, or
dreamt of, or desired to see, hear, read, or dream
of—could have made such a courtly speech.
From high-born lips alone could it have come.
The very coronal—the full and splendid flower of
all his glory we have yet to quote. Behold, and
grovel:—“The Russian Ambaisador introduced
me to the King and the Queen and to the Crown
Princess of Denmark, and their Roval Highnesses
shook hands with rne most heartily.” And again:
—“ I had the honour of a short conversation with
the Crown Princess, who put a few questions about
Australia, and England afterwards.” This will
have to finish it. More, and you would be Intoxi-
cated with magnificence. But we will add that,
if the Royal Family of Denmark—(This is the out-
come of remorse: we have been flagrantly men-
dacious through several inches of type, and we
think it is about time to give our conscience a
chance)—had only had the gloomy experience of
Henniker which wo have had, the King would
now be going about with the key of the meat-safe
chained to his girdle and the royal crown nailed on
to his head, and the Lord Chamberlain would
wander about with a countenance of haggard
anxiety, and the regalia—according to Instructions
received from his Royal master—painfully and
secretly plugged up in his ear.

Useful Tonic for Digestive Organs.
93 COLLINS-STREET EAST, Melbourne.
Gentlemen,—I have carefully examined the
samples of Bavarian Hop Bitters which yon
sent to me. They contain some useful tonics and
stimulants for the digestive organs, and appear to
be quite free from any deleterious ingredients.
Possessing these qualifications, and being palat-
able, with a fine aroma, their use will doubtless be-
come universal. I have already recommended
them to several of nsy patients. Wishing you the
success you deserve,—I remain yours truly,

HT THIRTY SHILLINGS.
THIRTY SHILLINGS.
The Autophone!
THIS triumph of musical Invention la acknow-
ledged on all hands to be the
MOST PERFECT, the MOST USEFUL,
and the
MOST ENDURABLE MUSICAL INSTRUMENT
of modern times.
It is a wonderful little instrument, which, while
It weighs less than three pounds, has the
LUNGS OF A FULL-SIZED PARLOUR ORGAN
and executes its music with
ABSOLUTE PRECISION AND PERFECT
EFFECT.
It has 83 reeds, plays in throe keys, and all the
parts of most difficult music.
To Mr. H. B. Horton, the Inventor, the world
was first indebted for the Organette ; but that was
too expensive to come within the reach of all.
After years of persistent effort and Intelligent
study, he has been enabled at last to place before
the world this complete little triumph over all
the difficulties of cost and crudeness.
It requires no skill to extract from it any sort of
music that may be required, the list of three
hundred tunes which it plays comprising selections
from Hymns, Oratorios, Operas, Waltzes, Polkas,
Marches, Popular Songs, &c., &c., &o. A child can
play any of these selections with perfect accuracy
The player requires no instruction further than
the few printed directions that are sent with each
Instrument, and are so plain that “he who runs
may read.” It is best adapted to the kind of music
which suits an organ best, in which chords pre-
dominate ; but It has also wonderful power in
executing very lively pieces. It is pitched for the
voice, and has a little card-holder for convenience
in singing. It will be found Invaluable for Country
Churches, Sunday Schools, Family Circles, and
for Dancing. Every shanty in the bush should be
supplied with one; and every household which
cannot afford a piano or organ should possess an
Autophono. It will afford greater and better
entertainment 1 ban four times the price can pro-
cure if expended in any other direction. Since
they were appointed Bole Agents for this marvel-
ous little instrument in the Australian Colonies,
18 months ago,
THE ORIENTAL GOLD CO.,
GP
474 George Street, Sydney,
Opposite the entrance to the Fruit Markets,
have forwarded hundreds of them to different
addresses throughout the colonies. Orders have
come to us from remote stations in the far North,
from distant mining camps, from many a lonely
thepberd on a far-off run, from farm-hands every-
where, from Sunday-school superintendents, from
clergymen, from residents of the cities—from
everywhere, in fact. And one of the best argu-
ments we can offer as to the genuineness of the
Instrument, is the fact that, in all our corres-
pondence, we have never had a letter that spoke
disparagingly of it. On the contrary, we have
hundreds of letters on file from customers who
have written only to tell us how greatly they are
pleased with it, and that they will recommend it
to their friends.
It is conceded by all educators and moralists
that music is the great refining influence, and
especially with children, its effect for good is
boundless. The love for music which musio in
the family engenders, is more potent in forming
dispositions and governing tempers than all the
treatises and lectures of the whole force of teach-
ers, pastors, and parents, and in conjunction with
these, is the oil or balm which renders an other-
wise bard task an easy one.
The price of the Autophone Is 80s.,
and where good music can be procured for such a
trifle, it is criminal for any parent (except, of
course, the absolutely poor) to let his household
be without it. With each Autophone for 30s, we
send three tunes of our own selection and a listed
catalogue from which the customer may choose
whatever tunes may suit his fancy.
All orders for music are sent post-free by parcel
post, on receipt of list price, and we make it our
business to see that all orders are promptly
attended to.
Send to us for catalogue of tunes at any time.

GLORY!
Say, what lies la that corner so dim ?
A hind ot a singular heap;
Of its hat it wears only the brim—
Is it dead, is it drunk, or asleep ?
“ Ohl that thing,” said a pro., “ I opine,
With a hat that’s all gone but the brim,
Is a super, who got just one line,
And ’twas far too much glory for him.”
Then we answered that pro., at d we cried,
In a manner that really was tart,
“ We trust that the Three Great Allied
Will very soon give you a parti ”
* * * *
It was our lot to go to the Gaiety to see
“Peep o’ Day” on Monday night, and we dis-
covered, both in the piece and its entourage, infinite
entertainment. Such a crowd in that theatre was
probably never seen before. It was packed and re-
packed; and, in consequence, the seats of even the
most obliging and rcsthetic critics were rushed,
and a modest (but we hope conscientious) reporter
was relegated to a box of which the position was
all the glory-since it is impossible, unless a front
seat is supplied at this particular theatre, to gauge
the merits of the scenic artist. From what we saw,
however, and we endeavoured to see all we could,
the labours of Kinchela are luminous in their pic-
turesqueness. It is without a doubt at all that,
after his “ glen scene’’—when it is considered he
has no “ scene-dock,” none of the mechanical
accessories so necessary to producing realistic
effect which scenic artists in great theatres can
command—he is a distinct rival of Gordon; and it
would be interesting to know what he could do
with the opportunities afforded by a stage like
that of the Royal.
* * *
“Peep o’ Day ” is a drama that is moder-
ately consistent. The special interest in the piece,
of course, centres in the Barney O’Toole of Mr.
Grattan Biggs. Mr. Riggs is entertaining in this
piece; but he would be more entertaining still had
he his company under better control. It is but fair
to state, however, that on the night we assisted at
the representation of “Peep o’ Day,” the audience
positively crowed at Grattan, and that his “ God
save the Poor!” melted the house. Every actor
makes mistakes, and, we really think, a lack of
concentration militates, to some extent, against a
performance which has certainly art; even if it
lack repose. Mr. Riggs, however, has knocked the
crowd with his Barney O’Toole, and that’s quite
ufflcient for him.
• • *
The cast of the piece ia one that means a
heavy “ treasury.” Mr. Henry Jordan played the
part of Stephen Purcell, the villain, and, in the
first act he was an astounding spectacle. He
appeared in a green velvet highwayman's coat,
violet breeches, and delusive boots. His wig was
an outrage, and his hat an Insult. In consequence
of the purse he carried, any man would have been
acquitted with acclamation for assaulting him
with intent to do grievous bodily harm. Have we
to tell Mr. Jordan (and a hundred others) that be-
cause he plays the villain in the piece he
has not to be assertive in his scoundrelism,
but to imply in his Interpretation of a part
all that the author wishes to advance. Mr.
Jordan is quite old enough to learn; and
we trust he will do so. Mr. F. C. Appleton
made a good Harry Kavanagh (you all know the
story), but his enunciation, in his endeavours to
make it distinct, became artificial; and thus he
missed some of his best points. Harry Stoneham,
however, made a capital old man as Father Grace,
though his diction, also, was a trifle deliberate.
Harry is rather a hero, by the way. He has the re-
putation of being a kind of homely gourmet, and is
dead mashed on dough-boys. Well, one Sunday,
when Harry was leading man at the Queen s, he
boiled a batch of dough-boys—intending, of course,
to load up himself and the family. In a moment
of abstraction, however, Harry left the saucepan
in the yard, and while all his family—like that of
Bob Cratchet—were cramming spoons into their
mouths so as not to shriek for duff before their
time arrived to be served, a felonious female
neighbour slid in and copped saucepan, dough-
boys, and all. But mark how Nemesis overtook
her:—
Bold Harry quickly lumbered her
(Let him be crowned with bays):
He didn’t get his doughboys, but
He gave her fourteen days.
We feel that some of the foregoing is hardly
dramatic criticism in one of its most distinct
phases—but we excuse ourselves on the ground
that any reminiscence of a distinguished per-
former is of interest to the public. Look, for
Instance, at Joseph Hatton’s book about Irving.
* ♦ •
Mr. Hasker made a rather feeble priest,
and his knocking down of Black Mullins was re-
ceived derisively. Mr. Poole, however, was very
funny, and his make-up entirely concealed his
identity. Mr. D’Arcy Stanfield had a good part as
the Captain of the Patrol; but an affectation of a
dialect, which is no doubt popular in the Strand,
completely spoiled an impersonation which
might otherwise have been effective. To pass
(as w© are rather in a hurry) a number
of the unknown who figured in the piece,
we will pass on, with a beating heart to the
ladies. Miss Ethel Adele enacted Kathleen
Kavanagh, and her appearance was surprisingly
attractive—the more especially altertheflrst
act, when she appears in a garb of black, which is
contrived with much cunning. But it is not be-
cause Miss Addle is attractive and we are sus-
ceptible that we can extend to her any special
favour. Indeed, we don’t feel much like it, be-
cause our susceptibility has brought for us a
splendid impression of a flat-Iro j on the back of
our head, and is invariably conducive to derisive
queries on the part of an estimable person (in
S’ ns) as to when we Intend to purchase new
for the children.
• ♦ *
Miss Adele, then, to break a par., stands
out in contradistinction to Mr. Biggs. She doesn t
lack repose, but overflows with it. And she
sings, too I "Savourneen Oeelish, and sings all of
it We have no doubt, whatever, that Miss Addle
could sing charmingly in a nice snug little parlour,
14ft. x9tt.; and though we don’t say—we are too
polite to do so-that her voice (a pretty voice) is
not powerful enough to fill the Gaiety we might
suggest that in future performances she should
not sing quite all of it. That gushing young thing
—she is getting more juvenile daily—played Mol-
shee, and had to make up ugly (which wo were
grieved to see); and had, in of her im-
personation, to sing a song ( Shan Van Voght )
which wo were grieved to hear. Miss Oliver hadn t
much to do, and what she had to do was curiously
conventional. Miss M. A. Melville (the Mary Ann
of our souls) played two parts. She was very sick
in the first act. and was supported (in a double
sense) by the whole strength of the company. She
afterwards rallied wonderfully; and, in the Fair
Scene danced a jig with great spirit. Miss Emma
Fischer evinced intelligence in her interpretation
of the nart of Mary Grace, and, she has a way of
always pointing one toe d la Columbine, in the love
scenes, which is charming. It makes you almost
wish you were a harlequin.
• • •
It is estimated that “Peep o’ Day” will
run for some time, and Charley M Mahon is un-
decided whether "Arrah-na-Pogue or The Fairy
Circle ” is to succeed it. The season will last three
■weeks longer, when Grattan goes to Parramatta,
prior to opening at Sandhurst (V.) under Charley s
management. And Charles is especially anxious
that we should state that for his Sandhurst and
Hobart seasons he has engaged Maggie Knight as
leading lady; and that, at Hobart, Signor Majeroni
is one of his stars, and “ Fddora” is to be the piece
de resistance . In connection with the Gaiety, it
iuay be lemarked that George Coleman, manager
for Mr. Reeve, has nothing to do now but keep
guard over the safe In the office, and flout impe-
cunious literary men who come there to sell critical
marmalade for shillings—or sausages. Charles—
we seem to be writing a deuce of a lot about this
gentleman lately—has purchased for lawful cur-
rency “The Wages of Sin” and “The Lights of
London.” This man will stick at nothing. He’ll
be for buying Dampier and his two kids next.
* ♦ * *
Talking of Dampier reminds us of “ Notre
Dame,” of course; of the gay Phoebus who makes
such unblushing proposals to Esmeralda, who,
while she says “ I will not consent,” consented; of
(it’s rhythmic to roll on with semi-colons) the
vicious Claude Frollo, who first smites Phoebus
under the fifth rib and then, (which we must ever
deplore) evinces conduct of an ultra-giddy nature
with regard to Esmeralda: of Quasimodo, who
strives to be guttural, but whose voice is always
(he can’t help it!) so singularly rhythmic; of Simp-
son, who is what Harwood used to call a sarsapa-
rilla troupe all to himself; and of,a host of things,
and of people who are all (Dr. Nelld) “pleasant,”
if not exceptionally artistic. We don’t know what
is coming next, but a creeping thought dawns
upon us that it is “ The Workman.” If that be the
case, Dampier is “ no more officer of ours.”
Notwithstanding the extreme—indeed, al-
most sickly—courtesy which this journal invari-
ably extends towards jadies (both plain and
picturesque) of the dramatic profession, we con-
fess that we are well content to part with the
sisters Lanyon; that we must own that it is not
without a sigh we part from their manager, the
ancient Warburton. This is principally because
the “Aged P.” — we quote Mr. Wemmick —is
Eossessed of a strong, if not consistent, sense of
umour. As a matter of fact, he has, In bringing
out the ladies Lanyon, proved himself to be of
facetiousness a master, and we have much pleasure
in glorifying Mr. W. in consequence.
♦ * ♦
It seems that the ladies in question are
pupils of Mr. Hoskins, and very fine buxom-look-
ing young people they are. They are about to
tour the colonies, and It Is needless to state that
they “ put up the stuff ” themselves. They com-
menced their rustic campaign on Monday last at
Parramatta; and, indeed, we are really glad the
Lanyon ladies commenced at Parramatta, because
their experience of that place would probably
cause them to yearn rather less after acting than
before ; and they would, in consequence, be
enabled to bestow more in charity. Mr. Hos-
kins, however, has evidently bestowed some
pains upon these young people, and he has
succeeded in teaching them to act a very
great deal. It is a matter of opinion, of course,
whether acting a great deal is a blemish or
otherwise; but we believe, if we could act in such
a great degree as these ladies, and journalism were
no longer available, we should return to our old
love—the ice-cream cart. But granting, for the
sake of argument, that Mr. Hoskins had taught
these ladles to perform artistically, it would
be too much to suppose that he would be
able to instruct them in the business of select-
ing a company. The crowd these ladles have
gathered around them are so ill-balanced that
they are picturesque in their unfitness to
interpret, according to our lights, such a play, for
instance, as Knowles’ “Hunchback.” Mr. J. B.
Steele is certainly capable of rendering Master
Walter in a manner which, if it be not artistic, is,
at least, satisfactory. But, on this occasion, the
depressing influences of his surroundings were
evidently too much for him, and his performance
was (to us) a source of silent sorrow. The two
sisters, Gwen and Marie, respectively played Helen
and Julia with an amount of aplomb that was sur-
prising. It was plain to see that they enjoyed
themselves .very much ; and that they didn’t care
twopence what the rest did, so long as they
could give it straight to the pit for three solid
hours. It would be unavailing to speak of the in-
dividual efforts of the other performers in this
“veiy tragical mirth,” since they were all so
heavily handicapped for want of rehearsals and—
everything. The entertainment, in a word, though
sad enough to be depressing, was not grotesque
enough to be amusing. Sincerely—though not
sternly orthodox in our religious opinions—we
feelingly advise the Miss Lanyons to change their
minds, and “ put it In the plate.” But they won’t.
They know what the love of acting is. ‘TIs not'a
“ fad:” it’s a disease.

Madame] Charbonnet-Kellermann gives a
grand concert on Wednesday evening at the Pro-
testant Hall, and has the assistance of such an
array of talent as should ensure an attendance of
social evening dimensions. The ladies are Rita,
Fabrls, Merz, and Mrs. Palmer, besides little Elsie
Stanley-Hall, a musical child-wonder whose
parents have to lock the piano to restrain her
passion for practising. Kadcliff, Willimotf, and
Charles Huencrbein also play, and Madame Keller-
mann herself will also perform. By the way,
Kowalski, now resident in Paris, where he is much
more thought of than ha seemed to be by Sydney
folks, told a friend of ours there that, in certain
features of her playing, Madame Kellermann can
compare favourably with even the tremendous
Rubenstein. The particular feature referred to
is the production of “singing” effects on the
pianoforte.
* * * *
Mr. Rainer (who, by the way, is worth
£30,000) opens with his diorama next Monday, the
17th, and he has requested us to state that he will
give away presents to the value of £300 a week.
We complimented Mr. Rainer on his prospects,
when he replied that he considered it season-
able weather for the time of yeir. We taen
enquired if he had heard Remenyl, when the old
gentleman replied that he didn’t consider £4 a foot
dear for it, considering the position and its near
approach to the sea-board. Lieutenant Hermann,
the ventriloquist, who is his business-manager,
then screamed—“ What is it you call your mansion
in Melbourne ?” And he replied, with a smile—
“ Yes ; I think sausages and mashed potatoes as
good a thing as we can have for supper.” And
talking of—dioramas, Thompson has returned from
the Cape one blaze of brilliants, as usual; and
having won £2000 on the Melbourne Cup, intends
resting.

At the Academy, Mr, Fleming Norton
continues his phenomenal success. His illness has
almost entirely disappeared. It is the audiences
who are now poorly.
The Town and Country Journal of
Saturday last (November 8th) gave a highly artls.
tic and commendatory criticism of Madame Char-
bonnet-Kellermann’s concert held at the Protestant
Hall on the Wednesday preceding (the 5th Novem-
ber). According to - the Jebnal the performance
by Madame’s pupils of “ Handers * Hallelujah
and Meyerber's (sic) ‘ Coronation March ’ on eight
grand pianos was a remarkable feature in
the programme,” the proficiency attained by
the girls reflecting “the utmost credit on
themselves and their gifted teacher. Mr.
John Radoliff “ discovered exquisite melody
on the flute,” while Messrs, de Willimotf and
Huenerbein showed their usuai proficiency.
“ The vocal part of the concert was sustained by
Signora D. P. M. Fabrls, Madame Rozalle, Mrs.
Spencer (a lady amateur), and Madame Pauline
Rita. Nor must the praiseworthy efforts of a
chorus of Signora Pabrls’s pupils be forgotten,
and a special tribute is due to the merits of little
Elsie Stanley Hall, who is certainly the most pre-
cocious of Madame Kellerman’s many promising
juveniles.” There was a ring of originality about
all this that led us to believe Alfred had secured
a new musical “ cricket." And when we whisper
that no (such concert took place in the Protestant
or any other hall, that Charbonnet-Kellerman, the
melodious Radcliff, the proficient Willimoff, the
effective Huenerbein, and the musical Mesdames
Fabris, Rozalle, Spencer, and Rita, do not appear
till Wednesday, the 19th November, it will be seen
how the enterprise of the Jebnal can dis-
tance all competitors. On the night when the
gifted virtuoso of the Town and Countby heard
Radcliff and Rita warbling at the Protestant
Hall those artists were in Queensland, drinking
iced water and bashing the first mosquitoes of
the season. We never knew before why the
leaders of the “ perfesh,” who visited us were so
anxious to get a good word from Alfred. We
know now. A “send along” from one who can
write with such esprit of a performance that
never took place, opens up a new department of
criticism.

MRS. BUCKSOME: “ARE YOU READY TO START, DEAR?”
MR. B.: “YES; BEEN WAITING FOR YOU THE LAST TEN MINUTES. WHAT A TIME
YOU TAKE I WHY DON’T YOU PUT ON YOUR DRESS, OR SOMETHING? SOMEONE

MRS. B.: “NONSENSE! HOW NEAR SIGHTED YOU ARE BECOMING. MY DRESS IS ON.”


In Japan rich persons have a h'gh respect
for dead cate. The report of a regal cat's funeral
comes from Yedo. The coffin was covered with 8
white s lk pall, and a body of chanting priests
followed the cortege to the grave. Later on a
handsome monument was erected, on wblcn was
inscribed the many virtues of the cat. We d ratner
attend a cat's funeral by day than hear it sing
night.
PEPPER AND SALT.
We have frequently had occasion to re-
tnark that existence must be an exceptionally gay
thing in Tumut, And the following quotation
ft-otn the letter of a Chidowla correspondent of
the TtrMtrr TiMteS rather Confirms our opinion
than otherwise. Here it is :—“ The body of a man
Was found stretched across a log in the river close
by hete bn Monday morning, the 13th inst., and
thobgh notice was at once sent off to the police the
body lies there still. The man is supposed to have
been drowned three or four months ago. Besides
this, persons have been shot at Pookham, and the
public school set fire to. This is a nice state of
affairs.” We should say it was. Quite a merry and
convivial state of affairs, in fact. It was only a few
days ago that the body of Susan Knapp, the ser-
vant girl who drowned herself for love of a police-
man-merciful Powers 1—was found, after being
five weeks in the river. They don't mind such a
trifle as a man or woman disappearing up there.
What is the use of looking for them '( If they are
In the river, they will drift ashore some day: and if
not, why that Is all the worse for the coroner. As
for complaining about '.the neglect of the police In
such cases, the thing is manifestly absurd. Is a
constable supposed to go and soil his clothes
dragging a river for a body, which in all pro-
bability will have nothing on it worth keeping
even when it is found, while there are drunken
men In the land ? The idea is preposterous. The
Government doesn't go to the trouble of provid-
ing men with long beards and large feet for work
ofthlsklnd. It provides them for-ah, what does
It provide them for ? Perhaps to play dominoes
and drink surreptitious beer for a lew years, and
then get the gout and the usual terrace of houses.
It is a gay existence anywhere: butinTumut—
In the midst of drowning and shooting and incen-
diarism— it must be a career of exalted glee. The
man in these days who would be a burglar when
he might be a policeman, is an idiot of the most
expensive type.

You must go to the North for hospitality.
There is none of the niggardliness of the city out
on the great free downs. We quote an instance of
this prodigal profusenees from the Daily North-
ern Standard:—" A buyer on a station out West
a few weeks ago concluded a bargain for some
5000 fat wethers, and forthwith struck his camp in
the vicinity of the station (not being pressed to
accept of anything in the shape of hospitality)
While waiting for the muster, his party ran short
of rations and sent up to the station for a quarter
of mutton, which was duly supplied. The bill
was subsequently duly presented for the whole
flock purchased, and at the foot of the account
was the item, * Qr. mutton 91b at 33., 3s. 3d.’ The
original transaction, it may be mentioned
amounted to over £2000.” There you have it now I
The squatter might have taken advantage of the
position of the buyer, but he didn’t He gener-
ously let him have the mutton at city rates. We
suppose if the Book of Manchester called at that
station he might get the mutton at half-price.
But he would have to cook It in his coronet. This
kind of squatter is no respecter of persons.

This item is a free gift to the temperance
lecturers:—“ Of ninety-two samples of water ex-
amined in one year by the Municipal Laboratory
of Paris, sixty-three were pronounced dangerous.”
We do not—though they might suspect so at first
—use this as an argument against the advocates of
temperance. On the contrary, we use It against
the publicans. It Is fatal evidence against them.
It proves that the liquor they sell is harmless until
adulterated—with water I Then it is a deadly
poison. The moral of this paragraph is plain. Let
every good Christian and father of a family take
his liquor straight, and the world wilA become a
healthy and a happy place, and the undertakers
will be reduced to burying each other.

If Shakspeare or Milton lived in these days,
they would probably be in the poetical advertising
line. There is more poetry nowadays in descrip-
tions of building allotments and paragraphs about
soothing syrups and sauces than is to be found in
all the books of song. Whenever you open a
country paper and wish to see the editor at his
best—in the full flower of his fancy and play of his
genius—look for the notice about the arrival of
the dentist, or the paragraph heralding the coming
circus. It will not do to judge by the paragraph
written after the circus has gone. We take one
sentence from an advertisement about pictures,
which it seems can be made from “any small gem
picture, old card,” or—if it came to a push—we
suppose, old shoe-sole. Says the advertiser :—“ To
keep fresh the memory of a deceased or absent
friend, nothing can be more suitable than to have
one of these Life Sized Enlargements to ornament
your parlour.” There is a blending of pathos,
delicacy, and business about this which is inimit-
able. There is pathos for the deceased friend,
delicacy for the absent friend, and business for the
Life Sized Enlargement. There must be little
taste tor the beautiful in the breasts of those who
could not be “ touched ” for the price of a picture
by such touching words. Yes, on the whole, we
have no hesitation in stating that! the poetry ot
the future will be chiefly published by the bill-
sticker.

Mr, Jobnson, the brand new Victorian
hangman, has earned golden opinions from the
Press by the neatness, smartntss, and general
business ability with which he carried out his first
gruesome job and made-to speak all iteratively—
his death-dealing debut. The morning dailies
across the border vied with one another in ex-
pressing their appreciation of this heaven-born
artist, but the evening dittos went a little further.
They went almost into hysterics. Thus we gather
from the Melbourne Herald that "the execution
ofCO’Brien is understood to bo his (the party by
the name of Johnson’s) first experiment in that
particular line, and it must be said that it was
carried out with commendable dexterity.” In
another column we learn that the commendable
dexterity mainly consisted in “ dislocating the
spine” of the gentleman experimentalised upon,
so we cannot but consider that the liberal en-
comiums bestowed upon Mr. Johnson are tho-
roughly well deserved. Reverentially we quote
the words of our friend Rip Van Winkle, “May he
live long, and prosper.”—
GOOD NOOSE.
(Dedicated to Heavy Villains )
Oh, murderers of Victoria!
What comfort for ye here!
In future ye’va but little need
The felon’s death to fear;
For ye no cruel ling’ring pangs,
When downwards ye depart —
The papers state that Johnson hang#
With such consummate art.
So, murderers of Victoria,
Go blithely on your ways—
Reflect upon the pleasing end
That now awaits your days;
Since dislocation of the spine
Is painless (Science says),
All peoole in your “special line ”
Should sing the praise of J.’s.

BRIEF MENTION.

Journalistic item. The sharpest articles
in the Echo are written by—the scissors.
Parliament is pro-rogued. Yet Parkes re-
signs his seat. But Parliament is also pro-Stuart.
The Conservatives will (when they get in)
make Salmon Wilson a Peer. Caligula made his
horse a Consul.
The time was—the man got on a bust and

The Manning River Times says “ the tick

The adaptation to environment which the
Darwinians speak of has at last reached the press.
The proprietor of the Bowral paper is called Beerl
The Mudir of Dongola made a K.C.M.G.

order was always a dirty one: now it’s mudir than
ever.
Says the Armidale Chronicle man:—
“Plenty of evil-speaking, lying, and slandering
going on in Armidale.” Well, why doesn’t he stop
it ? We mean his paper.
A Wilcannia magistrate lately stated from
toe Bench that the penalty for conviction of
habitual drunkenness was six months. This is the
way towns are depopulated.
Braidwood Minstrels gave a show a few
nights since. ’Tis said the public recognised in
one of the corner-men Creswell. Just because the
latter is a lunatic, we suppose.
They say the valet of the Duke of Man-
chester is a greater swell than his master. We do
not wonder at this. He could hardly help being
so—he is so often taken for the Duke.
The days of miracles are not past. A
sailor nearly “ kicked the cheek off ” an apprentice
at Newcastle the other day. You can see it in the
local papers, if you won’t believe us.
The Casino brass band played for two
hours when the railway news came to hand, so the
residents packed up beer and sandwiches and went
out into the wilderness to give vent to their joy.
junee Junction is now called “Loftus.”
The inhabitants are sever tired crowing about the
change. We candidly confess this is the meanest
joke [Is it a joke ?— Ed. B.] we have ever written.
Lord Wolseley takes with him £3000 worth
of angling tackle to catch fish in the Nile, where
the only fish are crocodiles. He also takes fifty
Iroquois Indians to scalp the Mahdi, whose hair is
shorn close.
There was a great storm in Penrith lately.
It uprooted the little glory shop of the Harmy and
blew it away—ah, yes—to blazes. There is some
comfort in knowing that the Harmy will be able
to find it again.
“Confound that band!” cried Smith on
the excursion steamer on the Prince of Wales’
Birthday. “ What’s your objection to the band ?”
asked Jones. “Objection!” retorted Smith; “why,
because I’m fond of music.”
From an esteemed contemporary:—“ The
Principal of a high-class school would be pleased
to receive a young lady, for one, two, or more
years, in exchange for piano.” We have a cart-
load of pianos to exchange at this rate.
“Hallo,” said the room mate of a Rum re-
porter, the other night, “ what in blazes d’ye mean
by going to bed with your boots on ? ’ Then he
caught him by the heel to drag him out. But he
had not his boots on: it was only his feet.
There is one saloon in Hamburg for every
seventy-one inhabitants. Happy Hamburg I As
all good Americans when they die are said to go
to Paris, we suppose all good journalists when they
spontaneously combust will go Hamburg.
A canvasser for a country paper got
bushed a few weeks ago. He was discovered
afterwards on(an ant-heap. “ Eaten by ants?” you
say. No such thing. He was only asleep. The
ants had not eaten him— but he had eaten the ants!
We gather from the Gundagai Herald
that the Adelong Miner has no fixed policy. We
are grateful for this information. This is no time
for a young nation to have its judgment warped.
Be one thing or another. At present the Miner
is another.
The fat and leisurely old ladies and gentle-
men who are in the habit of prodding tram-con-
ductors with umbrellas &o., when they want to
get out, needn’t be afraid of hurting the officials,
who now, in view of this popular signal to wait,
wear pads.
The burial expenses of the Duke of Albany
were £2750. This was paid by the taxpayers of
Great Britain. Well, we think they had the worth
of their money. If (Before saying any more,
we shall have to look up the present penalty for
high treason.)
“ Is it wise to kill him ?” is a question that
headed an article in a late Echo. We did not read
the article, but we presume the question had
reference to the “ Pith and Point ” man. And we
answer certainly it is wise. Everything is wise
that is necessary.
A Southern reporter lost his note-book,
and in advertising for it said it contained valuable
articles. The opposition scribbler found it, and
out of curiosity looked the “valuable articles”
over. They consisted of a penny with two heads,
four aces, three loaded dice, and the leaf of a
prayer-book.
An old man kangaroo went to pay a visit
lately to an Adelong lady while her husband was
away. She shot him (the kangaroo) with a revolver.
Kangaroos are like men. The older they become
the less morals they have. Unfortunately it is not
yet lawful to deal with the men as with the
kangaroos.
A visitor to Melbourne draws the atten-
tion of the authorities to one great deficiency in
the civic get-up. He complains that the tops of
the buildings are not furnished with weather-
cocks. The complaint has excited indignation.
Leading men ask: Which of us does he want to
mount the roofs ?
The Comte de Paris having informed the
Pope that he had had a son born to him, the Pope
sent back his benediction. Then the Comte re-
mitted to His Holiness 10,000 francs. Our bene-
diction is obtainable on such occasions by payment
(strictly in advance) of 5000 francs. On other occa-
sions, we charge even less.
The Echo, in its report of the proceedings
at the prorogation of Parliament, observed that
“they were shorn of some of their usual grandeur,
the attendance of ladies being rather small.” We
highly approve of the term “grandeur” in this
connection. The women who usually attend on
such occasions have so much grandeur—of foot.
The latest Salvationist freak is to carry a
black coffin in procession through the streets, the
bearer singing—
“Death is coming, and the Judgment Day;
Hasten sinner, hasten sinner;
Seek the narrow way.”
The next sensation is to be a big bonfire, repre-
senting hell.
We were turning an old file of the Alfred
the other day, and we saw this advertisement:—
“Lost, a Football Boot, left boot; reward.” We
believe we have found this boot. We regret to
say though, that that we have made up a bed for
our dog in it every night since we found it. But
the owner can have it on application. He will
have to dispossess the dog first; but that is a trifling
matter. He is a gentle animal—a cross between a
bulldog and a bloodhound.
The newspapers published in that palmy
village complain that, although there.are ten or
twelve pressmen in Parramatta, there is only ac-
commodation in the Court House for three. But
then they should consider the space taken up by
their lunches—and their boots—and their ears.
They can hardly expect to have a corridor all to
themselves.
The Thargomtndah Herald (a Queens-
land paper) says, in puffing a travelling photo-
grapher:—” He is so well known here as a capable
artist that it is unnecessary for us to sound his
praises. Of course we will get the whole of our
staff photographed.” This will be a lift to the
photographer. And what a group it will be—the
editor and his keg!
Bierce, the clever prattler in the ’Frisco
Wasp, says: “It is not known how the custom
arose of expressing a higher degree of reverence
by putting an 'I’m the word ‘God.’” Bierce is
all right so far, but he might have explained that
It must have been a priest who conceived the idea
of expressing a higher love by adding a “ hell ” to
the idea of a God.
It is stated that if the Imperial Govern-
ment are promised the Irish vote on the Franchise
Bill, they have arranged with Mr. Parnell to dis-
miss Mr. Otto Trevelyan and “shift” Lord Spen-
cer. Our troubles, anyhow. All we want to know
is when G. R. Maclean and Mr. Richardson are
going to be nominated for Carcoar. We have a
mind, now, above trifles.
The Camden Times man gave expression
the other day to the wild hope that his words
“would have the small effect of awakening people.”
Well, it is time. His words have put them to sleep
long enough. But, if he will take any advice from
us, we would suggest to him not to awaken his
subscribers too suddenly. If he does, they will
surely make a holocaust of him,
Sir Henry Parkes bragged of having made
the acquaintance in America of Jay Gould, and
has hinted about some big scheme in which Ame-
rican capital is to be employed here. London
Vanity Fair of September 13 remarks: “ Experi-
ence of the past has shown that anything with
which Jay Gould is connected is usually unworthy
of British confidence.” Verb. sap.
Says the Rum:—“The most attractive
sight on this earth is a beautiful woman, beauti-
fully clothed.” When that leader was first put in
type the last two words were not in the sentence
quoted. They were added by the moral editors in
council assembled. They feared that the public
might have thought that their fancy was a beauti-
ful woman without her—[Yes, yes.—Ed. B.]
“Well,” said Joseph, as he stared at
Parkes’s purchases in the Art Gallery, “ they can
say what they like about Henery, but at getting
vorses and for his sufferin’ country, you
can’t lick him. That there poreslum bole now is a
shade over. It might be real chaney for all you can
tell to the contrary.” Then he passed on to look
at the plaster cast of the “ Venus de Medicine.”
Here is an Australian reversible syllogism
which will be peculiarly appreciated in those
halcyon tundras through which the mad Murrum-
bidgee raves. A man takes to drink. He edits a
paper. He dies. A man dies. His corpse takes to
drink. It edits a paper. And then the cruel
corollary :—The traveller passes by in a few years,
and weeps. “ Ah,” he sobbingly soliloquises, “ a
cemetery.”
The presiding magistrate at the Towns-
ville pofioe court was presented, the week before
last, with a pair of white kid gloves. There were
no oases—not even one poor “ drunk.” The decs *
denoe of Townsville has set In. Many people are
seriously thinking of selling out and removing
to Cooktown. There the copulation still get
drunk. They have to: the Independent is pub-
lished there.
There is a Messiah up North. He is an
informer. They wanted him to change his name,
but he refused. He is determined to get the benefit
of whatever is in it. Perhaps he will get more than
he bargains for. He might get crucified. But we
would hardly go the length of crucifixion in these
days. We are too civilized. If Christianity were
preached afresh, and it looked a payable thing,
R. 8. Smythe or Jim Allison would run it as a
show.
This is both for publication and as a guar-
antee of good faith. One of Alfred’s "crickets”
has been suspected lately of inheriting several
shillings, and was accordingly accosted the other
day by a brother genius, who said, “ Look here,
old man, the fact is .” “He who steals my
purse, steals trash,” murmured the “cricket.”
r ‘ Then, jam it,” returned the other, “ give me your
good name. I must eat; and hominy’s better than
nothing.”
“I should like to know how to increase
my circulation," said Fergy (how are you, Fergy ?)
to a friend the other day. The friend mused for a
moment, and then remarked, “ I could tell you
how to do it only you will scorn the suggestion.”
“ Let us hear it,” said Fergy impatiently. “ Well,
don’t write anything in the paper yourself I” The
seasons may come and go, and year fade into year,
but that man, though he live till the Judgment
Day, will never offer advice to an editor again.
We did not think there was such guile in
the world as seems to exist among the native
journalists of China. Here Is what the North
China Mail says of them:—“They exhibit the
worst features of the Chinese character. So far
are deceit and dishonesty practised in the native
papers that, although their news is largely ‘ dished
up ’ from the foreign Journals, yet they seldom
acknowledge the source from which they obtain
it.” This is shocking depravity, Indeed. And yet
we would be sorry to say that Alfred’s paper was
run by Chinese.
A curious old brass cannon was discovered
on Jones’ Island, north of Port Darwin, lately.
It was loaded. The question as to who left it
there is—says the Northern Territory Times—
a mystery. We see no mystery. Noah ;eft
it there. He was afraid to discharge it openly,
so he marooned it. Tubal Cain used to make
cannons of this description in great quantities.
He was also the inventor of the pea-shooter.
Noah had a battery of those cannons to keep the
elephants out of his state-room. He sold most of
them (the cannons) afterwards to the American
navy.
The Adelong Miner has a Paris corre-
spondent. He is said to be one of the best men
with the pick and gad between Tumut and
Tarcutta. But when he talks of “Sardue’s” new
play he is in the wrong drive. We wonder he did
not call him Sardine I Perhaps it is as well, under
certain circumstances, to stick to the pick and
gad. Still It is only natural the people of Adelong
should like to know something about the gay
doings in Paris, and have some light thrown on
the machinations of Bismarck and the dark ways
of European diplomacy. What is life without
news?
A gentleman in Carcoar—a gentleman
against whom, we confess it with shame, we long
entertained feelings of envy, he having reft from
us that Mary who was the idol of our souls—says
in the local paper that we “ published with hungry
avidity” all his copy till he “began to fix the
price.” It is too true. We own it. We published
it with a free and unhesitating hand—in the dust-
bin. He also adds that if he were writing for us
he would starve. This, too, is grimly correct. He
would starve to a spectre—unless, ah, yes, indeed
—unless he ate his copy.
The Cooma Miller—a little paper which,
comes out perseverlngly two or three times a
week with two or three dim old stories in faded
print—says, while writing some rather ill-natured
things of us, that he does not descend to the con-
duct of some newspaper men who “engage pho-
tographers to take life sketches of the lower limbs
of their fair relatives.” What is all this to us ?
And even if he doesn’t, we daresay there are
reasons—either his “fair relatives” can’t be kept
still long enough, or the photographer refuses to
take their hind-legs unless guaranteed from in-
jury. We see no virtue in abstinence like this.
You have seen the gorgeous New Jeru-
salem pictures of townships of the future on
hoardings around the city ? Good. Here is a
figure from one of them. It represents a sale of
a township site in the country. We quote from
the local paper:—“An aged party in the fore-
ground is having a chat with some young people,
and evidently in reply to a question from one of
the young ladies, he says, ‘Ah! my dear girls, I
would not bo begging to-day had my old man only
bought an allotment of this land when it was sold
so very cheap—oh, so very cheap!—just one hun-
dred years ago to-day!’ ” In such a case he would
certainly not have been begging. He would not
have been born. But his father would have been
begging I
SKETCHES CAUGHT ON THE FLY.
Woman Items
The war between France and China will,
no doubt, soon cease, for false hair has almost
doubled in price, In 1882, 70,758 kilos, of hair were
Imported to Prance. The quantity in 1883 had in-
creased to 124,715 kilos., the bulk of which was
from China.
There are no less than three matrimonial
agencies and papers being run in London, and yet
the people are not happy. What we want to hear
Is that the boys are running about selling the
Divorce News and the Co-Respondents' Her-
ald. Why should so large a section of the com-
munity be utterly unrepresented ?
There are no limits to romance. In a new
novel, “Her Irish Lover,” by Mr.JAlec Roy, the
heroine is represented as kneeling outside a gaol
while “her Irish lover,” an enthusiastic young
poet, is hanged; at the same time she is receiving
the attentions of an English substitute, who ulti-
mately marries her. Yes, some girls would flirt
with a mummy and make eyes even at the sheriff’s
deputy.
The Bombay staff officers occasionally
want to know too much. A list of women and
children requiring passage home in a troop-ship
included two babies, with an explanation that, al-
though not yet come into the world, they were
shortly expected to do so. Whereupon a gahant
Brigade-Major sent back the list to the officer who
compiled it, directing him to have the sex of those
infants put in.
“ There is something about your daugh-
ter,” said the young mau reflectively; “there is
something about your daughter ” “Yes,”
said her fond father, “there Is; I have noticed it
myself. It comes every night about eight o’clock,
and it doesn’t go away usually till about eleven
o’clock. And some of these evenings I’m going
to kick it all the way from the landing to the
front door, and see what there is in it.”
A curious case of abduction—or elope-
ment—has happened in Paris. A gentleman went
with his two daughters, aged respectively 17 and 18,
to the Opera. There being no room for all three
in the same box, the two young ladles were ac-
commodated In one, the father in another, next to
it. During the intervals he saw and conversed
with his daughters, but at the end of the perform-
ance the party got separated going down the
grand staircase, and the girls have not been beard
of since.
The editor wrote: “ Mrs. possessed a
form that a Juno might envy.” Next morning he
read in his paper that “ Mrs. possessed a form
that Jumbo might envy.” He knew that there
would be trouble as soon as the lady’s husband and
her four brothers saw the article; and noticing
that there was a commotion about the house of
the lady who had such a magnificent form, be put
some biscuits L> a bag, bade his family good-bye,
and started off at a hand-gallop. He telegraphed
back, offering a reward for the scalp of the proof-
reader.
Fashion, says G. A. Sala, is, and has been
in all ages, a mystery. It is like Fancy. No one
can tell with precision whether it is bred in the
aeart or in the bead. It comes no man knows
whence, and departs no man can tell why or
whither. The only certainty about Fashion is that
so long as communities are wealthy, the dress of
women will be exceedingly costly. 1 do not pre-
tend to determine how expensive may be a lady’s
oall or dinner dress, but I maintain that it would
be with extreme difficulty that a gentleman could
put as much as twenty pounds’ worth of clothes
on his back.
A visitor to Quebec says “ There are few
homely girls here. I don't claim they are all
beautiful, but I have seen none ugly. There is
something In the invigorating air and hilly walks
that gives them sparkling eyes, rosy complexions,
and elastic step, when they are ascending a steep
hill they don’t seem to mind; they don’t Jag or get
out of breath; they don’t stagger or wobble, but
Just go up as lightly as a lady across a parlour
floor. You can’t keep pace with them, unless
you’ve been brought up here. Steep streets, vita-
lising air, and plenty of exercise, form the secret
of the girls’beauty in Quebec.” It’s ureatfunto
see a Sydney girl climb up a little bit of hill.
In'.Dr. Crichton-Browne’s report on “ over-
pressure” in English schools, it is stated that one
official found, on the day of his annual inspection,
that “36 per cent, of the parents of the children at
the school were out of employment, that 40 per
cent, of the children came to school sometimes
without a breakfast, and that 28 per cent, some-
times came to afternoon school without a dinner.
In one school in which starvation abounded.lt was
no uncommon thing for a poverty-stricken
mother, perhaps a char-woman or a flower-seller,
who had had to send her child to school without
food because there was neither food, money, nor
money’s worth in the house, to arrive at the
school-house in the forenoon, after she had been
out and had earned a few pence, and ask to be al-
lowed to hand in a piece of bread to her starving
child. These children,” continues the doctor,
“want blood, and we offer them a little brain-
polish; they ask for bread, and receive a problem i
for milk, and the tonic sol-fa system is Introduced
to them.” Dr. Browne finds, in the deplorable
condition of thousands of school-children, the
origin of much of the craving for stimulants in
after life—the origin of many of the suicides, and
of much of the insanity and crime.

To the few yet unacquainted with the
fact, we would gently suggest that a profitable
hour might be consumed in wandering over the

where are now on exhibition a choice lot of elec-
tro plated ware, biscuit jars. &c., of Ingenious de-
sign aud attractive pattern.*

" THE POOR PLAYER."
[Correspondence is invited from members of the
Theatrical Profession.]
This is written at a time when the world
seethes with amusements ; when every little hall
and “.converted” chapel resounds with the strains
of cat-gut; and when the sallow-cheeked'artist,
the black-flecked minstrel, and the assertive circus
man more than usually pervade the street corners;
a circumstance which more than usually adds to
the embarrasment of the lady promenader. But,
in all this wondrous wave of amusement, there
are here and elsewhere but few novelties properly
so-called..Of "Borneo and Juliot.” in Adelaide, we
learn that it is drawing payable business And
Wybert Reeve is still at it at the Aca-
demy “The Squire,” the “Crushed Tragedian,”
and probably Count Fosco, and other novel trifles
to follow. Dunning’s crowd succeeds Wybert and
Christmas there; and Dave Clinton and Jessie Grey
and the “Vivian Company” are busking about
South-east and North respectively. A note from
one of Arthur’s company doesn’t seem to indicate
that he has been making over seventy million, but
there’s no knowing. And, to Jog along, “ Professor
Anderson” is at Garner’s Rooms (or theatre ?) with
a new “World of Magic.” Everything in Mel-
bourne is in full blast, not a single cabotin being
without his little engagement, with the off chance
of the “ ghost ” wal king. Hlscocks, with the same
old mob, is at the Victoria Hall, and Dr. Npild says,
grimly: "The list now includes Mr. Carroll, who
is not unknown to us.” The same authority, despite
his unfavourable notice of “ In the Ranks ” at the
Opera House, writes that “ it continues to enjoy
a large measure of success.” [1111 He also says—
in reference to the same piece—" Miss Bishop’s
Ruth Herrick takes away, for a time, the miso-
gynical which sometimes darkens our eyes, that
the race of good women threatens to be extinct.”
He then remarks on Miss de Grey’s “artistic taste, ’’
and further states that she made “ quite clear ” the
“passion conflict” in “Moths.” Then we hear
about “the light gracefulness ”of Maggie Stewart I
[II] This is the very wheezing of the critical
“ lean and slippered pantaloon.” But come along!
Just a few simple rhymes. Allans!
TO “TAHITE.”
What is the screed, oh, answer, man—
What is the kind of stuff
That savours of the warming-pan,
That smells so strong of snuff 7
This is the vacant kind of prose,
Though pleasing to each charmer,
That smacks of tallow on the nose,
A crutch, and a foot-warmer.
But we’ll forgive your want of wit.
That blank behind your forehead—
For we know well the cause of it,
The fascination’s horrid.
.. Let’s consider I Yes; Ned Millis is at Palmer-
ston, N.Z., with the Girola yacht party ...And
poor old Dick Kohler, who used to play on so many
instruments, is said to have gone stark, staring
mad In ’Frisco. We hope this isn’t the case.
Kohler was a kindly fellow, besides being a clover
musician Llddy, another friend, has left Jennie
Lee (who has sold her wardrobe, and goes to New
York), and is now manager for Genevieve Ward,
in Christchurch... And, by the way, Mrs. H. R.
Harwood poisoned her foot the other week, and is
lust getting ill as the old man is getting better.
And nothing can stop Mrs. G. B. W. Lewis,
who is playing-think of thatl-Fatiraa in “ Blue
Beard, ,r at Timaru... And, once more, some
Journalistic ass puts forth that Patti contemplates
visiting Australia before retiring. Adelina wants
£800 a night, and there is !no Australian manager
who could afford to give her £800 in a fortnight.—
A truce to this, ye scrawlers, cornel
Ye are a sorry band;
Just tell us of (ssy) beer or rum,
For that you’ll understand.
And poor Georgle Smithson, who fractured
her arm in a coach accident at Arrowtown (N.Z ),
is progressing all right. The lady, however, fell
upon a Mr. Hennesy, “who was severely bruised.
Oh, and the “vhic” company recently adver-
tised a “ben.” for the Wanganui Poor-house, had
£30 in, and nobly lavished a “ couple of quid ” on
the institution. The directors, indignant, at this,
wftntcd to f?iv0 tbe 44 Chics tb© bftckj hut it
was discovered that only one “Chic” then re-
mained in Wanganui—who, however,>as perfectly
ready to receive it....Clarke and Ryman are still
In Auckland—catch them going back to Limburger
cheese again in a hurryl-and playing “ Under the
Gaslight,” and other Jovial pieces. Well, perhaps
they are right; their humour was always lees
funny than their pathos.... We see that J. P. Mae ■
donald pilots the “Fun on the Bristol” company
to Dunedin, where they open on Boxing-night.
There was a funny story told of J.P. and the
aesthetic James recently. However... .But, talk-
ing of Melbourne. “The Merry Duchess,” even
with Emma Chambers, has turned out a complete
frost Miss Emma first made a hit at the St.
James' Theatre in a not very bright burlesque by
Burnand called “Poll and My Partner Jo,’\ in
which she was the tiniest admiral you.could
imagine, and used to sing-*-
“ I’m an admiral, and so I shall
Do Just whate’er I please,
And take a boat and get afloat,
And sail across the seas.”
And a lot more. This was fifteen years ago; so we
minnose Miss Chambers has quite cut her eye-teeth
bv this time....And, hold 1 The Bell-ringers
(Lynch’s) are bearing slowly down upon us. They
were last heard of amongst the alligators. There
has evidently been some difference in the critical
poliev of the papers In Cooktown, for the Wondek-
eul Fowler says:—“Our blatant contemporary
might insult the company if his circulation extend-
ed beyond the line (sic) and a few pubs. . . His
allusions to the Vagrant Act (sic) were only a
muddled attempt to be witty.”... Jou must know
too. the Victoria Amateur Dramatic Club is in full
blast at Temora, and the name of Edward Solo-
mon's now opera is “ Pocohontas, in which Lilian
Russell is to fulfil the title role ... Dismal accounts
reach us of Ada Ward in the “ Honeymoon,”
“ supported ” by Captain Disney Roebuck, who lor
a lot of years had the theatre at the Cape (and is a
military masher of “professional proclivities);
and “Galled Back,” which we are soon to have
here, is a rank failure in New York. . .But little
“Lyt.” Sothern seems to be a good deal more in it
in New York than he was here, where the Union
Club and the Barracks settled his little hash. He
made a little money when he first arrived with Ada
Ward to do “ Les Danlcheff ” (it was always Dam-
phpffs in the papers here), but he had letters or
introduction & Lord Lytton (his god father),
which effectually “cruelled” him. The swells,
however, in order to get rid ot him (for he was
getting a b“t seedy and had a thirst for tenners),
irave Sothern a ben. at the Guildhall, and he just
Sot awav. The old man was alive tnen, and was
written to, on dit by Vice-royalty, but the answer
came back from Lord Dundreary that ‘ he could
not spare any of his ham earnings for his son s
S,™ viaisirs. Lytton was a nice-looking boy,
but quite devoid of intelligence, learning all his r6les
by note, and rather boring you than otherwise....
And did wo tell you that Lewis and Davies’ circus
has been at Inverell 7 No? W” ell, it's a fact.. ..And
Silver King Jones’ new play “ Saints and dinners
waa whistled off .the stage of the London Vaude-
ville • It will bo remembered that we stated Mr.
Goodman, the treasurer of the Royal, had been ill,
but not dangerously so. We are sorry to state
that Goodie has been very bad, indeed, but con-
trived the other morning to crawl round to the
Koval. where Bill Seagrave is at present (heavy,
thbb fulfilling this functions. Goodman is still
very bad; and his friends all told him that, if he
o raw Is round to the theatre much before he
Wes up a bit, he will crawl up to heaven.
“ Churchman ” sends along the following
clip from the religious bill of fare published in
Saturday’s Morning Muffin, and Indignantly asks
“ What next, and next ?” “ New Church, Sydney
Society. Subject, to-morrow evening, ‘Joseph’s
Coat: Was it of many colours, or many pieces, or
a long coat, or all three, or neither of them ?’ By
Dr. A. B. Walker.” Honestly speaking, that let’s
us out completely, and we frankly admit wo do
not know what comes after Joseph’s Paget, be-
cause there is no evidence to prove he ever wore
eitner a shirt or a waistcoat. All that we learn
from “ Britain’s bulwark ” is that on a certain
eventful morn when the giddy old Mother Poti-
phar warbled into her male slavey’s ear [he was a
coachman, beyond a doubt] “You may ki-is me
and caress me and I won’t tell Dad-da,” and the
virtuous youth immediately skipped the premises,
the first thing that came after the collar of his
coat was the prize-ham like fist of the baffled
missus, and the next thing that caught the tail
end of the garment—and caught it good, too—was
the copper-topped toe of the old man’s boot; but,
anyway, the New Church sermon looks remark-
ably like a cheap ad. for some of our master tailor’s
Spring goods. And this being so, Dr. Walker’s
next oration will probably bo labelled “ The Chaste
Susanna. Did she patronise the Turkish Bath, or
Wlgzell’s ? And secondly, did she use Bear’s
Scented Soap [patronised on the usual “ comish ”
by Lily Langtry] Old Brown Windsor, or Rottie’s
Jelly Paste, sold in Is. tins and warranted to check
the ravages of Dandruff, Boils and Freckles?”
The idea's good, and opens up a new advertising
Held that is simply Inexhaustible.
There is a plutocrat out towards German-
town who writes to the local press about the kind
of houses bank managers live in. in the bush. The
plutocrat describes some colossal structures in his
vicinity, and says roundly that the manager who
is sent to live In one of them, on the average
managerial screw, will not be able to furnish the
inside in keeping with the outside, and possess a
pure and undeflled soul at tne same time. The
opinion may be right or wrong, but it reminds the
present writer of some bankers’ houses which he
knew in the bush, and, among them, of one, the
sumptuous elegance of which, externally and in-
ternally, a short anecdote will lay bare. Four of
us were enjoying a game of whist coming on mid-
night. It was in the consulting-room, and the
tables, chairs, and sofa were the property of the
Company, the manager supplying his own lights,
glass, and crockery-ware. The manager and teller
were bachelors, and they “ batched ” —that is, did
tneir own cooking on the premises. It was rather
a breezy night. The wind, coming through chinks,
made the candles run all to one side. There were
three of them on the table, and, as the Company
supplied only two candlesticks, the third candle
had been put standing iu the neck ul a bottle.
This third candle was farthest from the teller, and
was burned down to within an eighth of an inch
of the bottle. Coming Ito the close of a rubber,
the teller was noticed to be very fidgetty. He
would look at the bottle, and then behind at the
door, and then fall into a meditation. He was
asked to explain. “Well,” he said, “Iwas in a
hurry going out to shoot the other day: and as
there was a hole in the canister, I poured the
powder into that bottle, and banged but the boss
has stuck the candle in the neck of it. It’s full.
Any fear of the IDht getting down ?” Oh, there
are some sumptuous bankers’-houses in the bush.
To behold them would raise beads of thanksgiving
on the brow of the Germantown plutocrat.
Judge Innes will have his little judicial joke,
even if it bursts him wide open to fire it off. At
the recent Hay Circuit Court, an impertinently-
curious young fellow named John Watson was
charged with feloniously entering the girls’ bed-
room at the Caledonian Hotel. There was no
evidence to prove that John went to do any par-
ticular deed that would disturb the peace ox his
Sovereign Lady the Queen or the Caledonian girls
either; and, in fact, the worthy Judge’s sympathies
seem to have been with the prisoner from the
start, as the local paper tells us he “looked upon
the charge as incapable of being sustained, and
accordingly indulged in a running fire of merri-
ment all through the case.” And then we get
quite a fizzy little squib out of the “runnlngjflre,”
wnich says “ the question was how Watson got
into the bedroom, and that was left unsolved. It
was simply a mystery, and, as His Honor declared,
as great a problem to him as bow the apples
got into the dumplings was to George III.” Our
own humble opinion is that John tunnelled along
underneath the pathway and then came up through
the cellar; but, perhaps, the apple-and-dumpling
anecdote affords the best clue, after all—the girls
simply laid John Watson on the floor and wrapped
the bedroom round him. Anyway, we are right
glad to find that the “ corner men ’’ of our travel-
ling nigger shows are not to have ail the hilarity
to themselves in future, and that the usual mono-
tony of our Circuit Courts will occasionally be
relieved by the “wholesome fun” of His Honor
Mr. Justice Innes.
The ‘ Polish ladies” sent as a deputation
to receive the Czar were all the wives of Russian
officers and officials. David Buchanan’s old friend
Rochefort writes that (heir “tournures” were
carefully searched for dynamite.

TO CORRESPONDENTS .
[ Correspondents who give neither name nor nom-de-
plume cannot expect to have their com-
munications noticed.]
“Simon Pure”: Needs re-writing. How-
ever, keep on. We will see to that ‘‘A.E.W.”
(Maryborough, Q.): Shall endeavour to suppy the
information. Thanks for encouraging remarks.
“Didymus” (Cobar): Certainly. Solon him-
self would doubtless decide that a person is not
guilty of indecent exposure unless he or she ex-
posed him or her self. Thehnagistrate who ruled
that a tipsy woman, exposed on the public street,
by a tipsy male friend, was not guilty, was un-
doubtedly a Cobar variety of Solon or of Solomon.
It is as clear as mud that if a fuddled pair choose
to be also a cuddled pair, the man may expose the
woman in the public street, and the woman expose
the*.|man,<| yet neither be£guilty“of!iindecent ex-
posure, and no offence against public morals be
disclosed, whatever else may be. ..“ Ferd. Schlie-
mann ”: Rather long for our usual style, but under
consideration—“ F.H.” (Ullamulla) : Your long
letter of 9th Oct. duly received, read, and digested.
We shall be always glad to hear from you —
“W.F.G.C.”: Certainly, send along. If suitable
we will supply. Present sketch has hardly point
enough “ C.W.B.”: Mr. W. Johnston, Deputy S.
Magistrate, sat alone in the Indecent Literature
case. Before, as you propose, his name be “ in-
scribed ©n a monument as the champion numb-
skull of the colony,” it will be necessary t© bear
in mind that some of the books seized were really
indecent. The Idiocy was in the charge including
other works which were only Indecent in the
same sense as medical treatises or the Bible
“Subscriber”: Much obliged. ,..“A.S.” (Welling-
ton) : Thanks. Your items are interesting. We
have used them. Shall always be glad to hear
from you “A.J.L.” (Cloncurry): Your previous
letter was mislaid. We gave it to one of our
humourists, who put it into the lining of his hat.
The hat disappeared from public gaze for a time.
He has since redeemed it, Your letter has, there-
fore, again come to light. We publish the infor-
mation it contains in this issue. If you have any
more items of the kind on hand, send them gaily
along — “Critic”; Oh, go and sleep it off
“ W.P.” (Bourke): You have given us a new lease
of life I You have, indeed. We were depressed
and; moody, drank our rum straight, and cursed
the world, when we received your letter. It acted
like magic. The assurance given;therein that our
paper is “ to be found In most tank-sinkers’ and
fencers camps In this district ” made new men of
us. We feel we can face the world again. We
have a respect for tank-sinkers. We boarded in a
tank once,Tand offered up many a whispered
prayer for the man who made It. _ Certainly we
did object occasionally to his having made the
hole in the top so small, but that was only
when we were clouded with abstract speculation.
And the fencers, too, we are fond of. We know
all about fencing. We used to practise it with
another journalist who has since gone off with a
circus, or got run o ver by a dray, we forget which.
He used to fence with us with laths we took out
of the lattice-work of a fowl-house in the next
yard. We were getting on very well when he was
“ lumbered ” and got fined. They wanted to make
out that he took off the laths to get at the
fowls. So, you see, we can quite understand
the aspirations of fencers. Your letter has
called up quite a lot of old memories. Write
pretty often to us, if you can spare time
from the shovel. We like to be cheered a bit
now and then. We have used your item....
“F.P.”: The number of subjects of the Empress
of India is 256,000,000.... “Ronald”: The office boy
desires to be remembered to you. He doesn t
think much of your verses, but he has given them
to his grandmother, who is an old lady of feeble
Intellect, and easily amused. He is obliged for the
envelope, though. He is making a collection of
old stamps. We shall take it as a favour if you
will, in future, address ycur letters to him....
‘C.B”: Thanks. You will see that we have at-
tended to the matter. .“Justice”: Your sugges-
tion for a cartoon received. Too complicated tor
adoption, but we are obliged for your friendly
attention....“Inquirer ” : You are right. We ve
noticed the same thing. When a hungry man
starts dinner, he’s a fierce Socialist. After a few
comprehensive bites, his feelings towards capital-
ists soften. At the second course, he is merely an
advanced Liberal. When the plum duff appears, he
thinks there is something in Conservatism. If
c afi nnir is in the programme, he’s a pronounced
“ Jingo ” by the time ’tis finished. Then give him
a “Henry Clay” and nothing short of autocracy will
suit him. Yes, you are right. Whoopi.... ‘In-
quirer No. 2” : This-is getting monotonous. Let
us tell you once for a'l we don’t identify ourselves
with Socialism. We never identify ourselves with a
cause we don’t thoroughly understand So far as
we do understand it, it aims at awarding the re-
sults of labour to the labourers, instead of to the
dead-heads. So far, we are with it. The truculent-
looking ghouls in stubbly beards, who are such a
God-send to the "comic” papers, appear to be the
more draff and offal of the great Socialistic move-
ment, just as the howling dervishes of 1649 and the
furies of 1789 were of the English and French
Revolutions “Parramatta”: We do not know
where the rules for “ pitch-and-toss ” can be
found, and your allusion to “ ringing in the tail
grey ’’ is Sanscrit to us. We’ve shown your letter
to everyone on the staff, but they never heard of
the game—“C. M’Carthy”: Received. Much
obliged for your good opinion “L.M.B.”: The
whole “par.” would have to be re-written, and,
candidly, it is not worth it. There is no earthly
reason why the elect should not occasionally be
unlucky in their matrimonial ventures, just as
publicans and sinners. A woman will stick to the
man she loves, however despicable he may be, and
deceive him she hates were he rolling in gold and
grace —“Percy B,”: You want to learn to swim
and don’t know how to start. We cannot assist
you, unless you intend to swim in beer. Drop us
a lino if you do “Lex”: Pause, ere it be too
late. Many a promising young life has been
wrecked by devotion to the Muse :—
“ See, people of Great Britain, and of her wide do-
mains,
See how ye’re held in ibondage and In [slavery’s
clanking chains I
Awake I you men of spirits free; strike for your
freedom brave—
Strike for it hard against the clan—for vietory,
or the grave 1 ”
This is but a wee bit of what you send. “ Strike.”
Helas! We are weary of this constant slaughter.
Our cellar now is stuffed with the bones of men
who called on us with “little things of their own.”
There's room but ! for one skull more. Thanks.
We knew you’d take the hint...." Washington”:
Your poem. “ Life’s wild, raging Sea,” is a remark-
able one. The opening verse—we have room for
it alone—
“O’er treacherous depths and wide shallows, in
the ocean of life,
With a varied cargo of happiness, regrets and
Through great waves of'[confusion and currents
of strife,
The frail barque of humanity sails.
Now it stems the wild rush of discontent [and
woe;
Now encounters the surge of despair;
Now tacks against winds of fate, whose long ad-
verse blow
Makes stoutest hearts on the .* ’tween decks ’
beware.-
“ Thus bars to progression and barriers to grace
Mark .strong the impression man bears on
his face,
And aid contempt of love and coldness fo r
glee
To make life but a journey through a wild,
raging sea ”—
is an exhaustive resumi of life’s struggles. Every
day we see, tacking past our window, the "frail
barques of humanity,” with varied cargoes aboard.
We cannot, of course, say what the cargoes are.
We only know that all seemed to have sailed from
Circular Quay with “rum” in ballast. Another
poem like yours, “ Washington,” and the light
will have gone out of our life...."Maude”: Did
you get our letter ?
A long-felt want has at last been supplied
to the votaries of the “fragrant weed,” by the
establishment of the Pall Mall “ Single Box ”
Depot, by that enterprising tobacconist, Mr. J.
Noake, who has had over 20 years’ experience in
the business. The establishment, as its name
implies, Is founded principally to supply our
smokers with a box of first-class cigars at whole-
sale price. As Mr. Noake imports direct from the
manufacturer, be is in an undoubted position to
supply smokers’ requirements. It is proposed to
carry on the establishment on the lines of the
famous Pall Mall Emporium of London, and with
the able management of Mr. Joseph L. Goodman,
the success of the venture is beyond doubt. ♦
One of the principal and most satisfactory
signs of the position of Sydney among the great
cities of the world is the gradual disappearance
of the “ general stores,” incidental to small com-
munities, to be superseded by lirst-class speciality
establishments under the management of men
who, devoting their exclusive time to perfecting
one article or branch, are able to supply the public
with the best value in that article. A leading ex-
ample of this truth is the old-established firm of
C. F. Prlddy and Co., hatters, of 438 George-street.
This well-known firm has just finished some con-
siderable improvements, not only in their shop,
but also in their extensive factory; and the con-
tractors, Messrs. Milhs and Harder of Market-
street, having just finished their work, Messrs.
Priddy and Co. can now claim to have one of the
best appointed shops in Sydney, the whole of the
interior being now one magnificent display of hats
of every conceivable variety and shape—making
special mention of the case of their own unrivalled
productions, their hatshaving gained prize medals
at every exhibition at which they have been shown.
It is a substantial and gratifying proof of the ad-
mitted excellence of their hats that their trade is
gradually increasing both at home and abroad,
the latter being shown by their recent shipments
to Ceylon of their hats specially manufactured for
the Indian climate,*
One of the saddest and most serious com-
plaints yet made against Bishop Barry comes from
that thriving boneyard called Penrith, and we are
confident that if the subject only causes one-half
the trouble to his conscience that it does to his
complainant’s stomach, the worthy Primate will
either resign at once or blow out his brains with a
bow and arrow. From the evidence now before
the ecclesiastical court, it appears Bishop Barrv
recently visited Penrith for the purpose of ad-
ministering the rite of Confirmation to some
twenty or thirty young warriors, “ by the laying
on of hands and by prayer,” and during the pro-
cess it is alleged by a writer who signs ‘ Pew v.
Pulpit ” that the Bishop lumped the lot, as it were,
by laying his hands on two candidates at a time,
and only repeating the prayer once, and that, too,
in a singular form over each pair. Naturally
enough, these parties feel that they have only had
a half-and-half or shandy-gaff sort of confirmation
and are liable to slide away from the ranks of the
blessed just as easily now as ever; but this is not
all the trouble, either. “ Pew v. Pulpit ” also de-
clares that immediately after his Lordship’s return
to Sydney the Penrith imeumbent received written
instructions to the effect that in future when ad-
ministering the Lord’s Supper the full ceremony
was to be performed—viz., “ The body of our,”
&c., and “ The blood of our,” &c., over each indi-
vldual'separately—thus causing not only an extra
hour’s continuous talking, unnecessarily, by the
incumbent; but being also a source of great worry
to pious mothers who have left the baby at home
in bed with the kitten—or a box of matches—to
amuse him. Besides this, one might as well look
for the grace of the Loard in a goat-house as in the
breast of the average healthy man who, after
sitting out such a long-winded service, is forced to
face a dinner done to rags; and then, again, who
can imagine the heartfelt misery it brings to those
Sunday-school teachers whom it deprives of the
few hours’ courtship so necessary to the health
and happiness of persons of that persuasion I This
is a serious matter, indeed, and one pregnant with
the fate not only of the Anglican Church, but even
of the morale of Penrith, for, as our indignant
correspondent truly says, “the result of this new
arrangement will be a rush for the first table to
get away in time, or there will be any number of
absentees.” We do not believe that the Church of
England was ever in a tighter place since the
rouseabout days of Bloody Mary; and, therefore,
we earnestly implore Bishop Barry to grip the
trouble at once, and squelch it worse than a bay-
press would a fat “gohanna.”
A Pretender-Prince has appeared on the
Burmese horizon. But His Majesty the King of
the Golden Foot and Many Umbrellas pays not the
slightest heed. Just now idleness is de riyueur at
Mandalay. The Court has ordered everybody to
go into profound laziness for a month at least.
Etiquette forbids any more serious occup.tion
than this amusement. Just as all Tartary had to
be silent while the Cham ate, so now that the
dorian fruit is in season in Burmah the King must
not be disturbed. “ His Majesty and the harem
are eating dorian,” This formula suffices to stop
everything. The discussion of his favourite fruit
must not be trespassed upon by any frivolities of
administration, or the flippancies of national con-
cerns. Let the firmament rain a deluge of comets,
let a wilderness of Mengwoon Princes congregate
upon the frontiers, His Majesty must not be
bothered. He is eating dorainl What kind of a
fruit is It, this wondrous thing that lays its relax-
ing fascination upon the whole machinery of go-
vernment; that stops, by the mere spell of its de-
liciousness, the routine of an administration ? It
is not easily described; but roughly speaking, the
following recipe may be ventured upon for imitat-
ing a dorian. Take equal quantities, say a quart,
of almond paste and onion sauce, and mix them
thoroughly with a pound of cream cheese. Flavour
it with as many essences as can be procured, and
serve up in a dish with an outrageously-
dead cat. The cat, of course, is not intehded
to be eaten. It is merely used as a garnish
to impart the necessary perfume to the fruit.
Yet the dorian is emphatically delicious. ’Tis but
the first taste which costs. Afterwards it has the
fascination of opium. The dorian-eater is insa-
tiable. He becomes voracious as a whirlpool,
bottomless as the pit. His appetite is unfathom-
able and Gargantuan, He will eat more, at one
sitting, than the human frame could be thought
capable of containing, and even then will look
hungrily at the spoon and plate as if he would
like to lick them as clean as Squeers’ pupils used
to do. The tastes flit over his bewildered palate
in such swift succession that he can no more
identify them taun a passenger in an express train
can identify faces on the platforms he dashes past.
It. is a procession of the ghosts of flavours, of the
phantoms of perfumes, and they crowd along on
each other's heels so fast that the eater can never
stop precisely at any one of them, and exclaim,
“ There, now, this is so and so.” It is already gone
past, and the next one is passing. It w»s almonds
when the eater opened his mouth, but before he
had time to say so it was onion-sauce, which turns
into vanilla-cream and then to cream-cheese, with
a dash of lemon and so to a meringue, sherry,
Swiss milk, raspberry—anything. So, though
comets blaze in the sky, and pretenders to the
Throne bluster on the horizon, there is tranquility
in Mandalay—“ the King is eating dorian."
Fine weather, large attendance, and good
contests left nothing to be desired at the Balmain
Regatta on Monday last. The ball opened with
the eight-oar race, and although individually the
Morcantiles appeared much the best on paper, col -
lectively the Sydney crew rowed in far and away
better form than their opponents, and led from
start to finish. The maiden fours fell to a Balmain
crew—Kinnimont, Reed, Frazer, and Langley:
Sharland came in first tor the bona fide amateur
sculls in wager-boats, under protest from Brett,
who finished second; Seale, Trimble, Brett, and
Martin, M R.C., defeated S.R.C,, and N.S.R.C.-cum-
S.R.C. crews lor the senior fours; the race for all
comers in light skiffs fell easy prey to Messenger
(501b.); and Smith and Durrell, G.R.C., won the
maiden double-sculls. For the all-comers’ race
Matterson was run out of his course, and Pearce
obtained a lead sufficient to render the Clarence
River man’s case hopeless. However, both men
finished the wrong side of the flagship, and
Messenger, who had retired, seeing the mistake,
again joined In, and rowed over the course, but
the umpire very properly ordered the race to be
rowed over again. The Chance made an easy win
amongst the canvasers; the Regina won the 10-ft.
race; Young Victor carried off the palm amongst
the 14-footers; the Australian again had an easy
victory over the Sao; the gallant little Rosetta
won the open boat race under 23-feet; and the
Buttercup, by time allowance, won the big half
deck race. The Victor, well sailed by her owner
wonjthe 24-foot open boat race; Regina, sailed by
George Fletcher, won the 16-foot professional
race, and the “ double event; ” and the Maritana
annexed the 20-foot half decked race. TheWanga-
rella, Ellis’ last, also started: but considering the
dead weight she had to hump along, it is not to be
wondered at she did not make a show. She is a
handsome-looking craft, and if Mr. Trebeck eases
her of the ridiculous amount of ballast she carries
ins de and out, he may still have a show of ex-
hibiting her tuck to the lot of them.
Valuable Water.—The West of England
is favoured with riveis and streams, the waters of
which have certain remarkable qualities that
operate wonderfully to the advantage of the
numerous brewers and woollen manufacturers
All the favourite sparkling ales that delight the
Britisher; owe their qualities to the pure, clear
waters; and West of England tweeds are world
famous. These woollen goods, on account of
their elastic warps, are particularly adapted for
boys’clothing; and, recently paying a visit to H.
L. Summerfleld and Co., the Great Juvenile Out-
fitters, 235 and 237 Pitt-strer-t, Sydney, we were
shown various samples from their huge stock (the
largest in Australia), nearly all of which were
made from pure tweeds from the mills of Bliss,
Marling, Brown and Palmer, and other makers of
note. Messrs. Summerfleld and Co. make a
speciality of a good, strong school suit at 10s. 6d.,
in sizes 000 to 6; and in long trouser suits for boys
of nine to sixteen, at 2ls., 25s., 30s. The goods are
manufactured and designed by their London
house, 51 and 53 Leadenhall-street, E.C.;
and those opened for the coming busy sea-
son consist of very pretty and neat designs
in the Lome, Greenwich, and Suetau styles.
A big job line in these shapes at 8s. lid.,
with some pure worsteds at 12s. 6d. and 15s. 6d., are

attention is paid to the making and trimming. No
rubbish is sold; each garment is stamped with the

in a match at Erith, Kent, Palmer clean

ordinary figures: 30 overs and 3 balls, 11 maidens,
17 runs, 10 wickets. Blackham’s five wickets only
cost 36 runs. The eleven to which they were
attached easily boat the sixteen opposed to them.
Gillen and Palmer scored 68 out of the 101 ruus
made by their side.
At the “ aquatic carnival,” at Albert

Fittes to the giddy throng as tne "amateur cham-
pion of the colonies.” If we mistake not, Nod
used to trot Brett out under the same title. How
is this thus ?
The Vandemonians appear anxious to have
a “shy in” for the next intercolonial eight-oar
race, and we cannot see now they can be very well
shut out, provided they raise a bona fide amateur
crew. It will, of course, be a drawoack to the
competing colonies having to send a crew away
two years running, but it is only natural the tight
Ittie Islanders will wish to have the race rowed in
due turn on their grand sheet of water, more es-
pecially if, in the future, they can raise a vic-
torious crew.
Cycling is now a sport at which, it seems to
us, the ordinary amateur has little or no chance.
XJnless he la .rich enough to disregard cost, he

These latter are found in fresh and fresh cycles,
and, besides, have them “regulat' d,” as one may
say, by the most skilled workmen. The better
machine wins, and in the fight between the maker
and the lay rider the skilled workman’s representa-
tive is bound to come out best.
Jack Burke, the English pugilist, had an
unlooked-tor opportunity of displaying his fistic
skill shortly after his arrival in America. He hap-
pened to ne riding in a New York street car when
five roughs began to amuse themselves by annoy-
ing a young lady. He ordered them to desist,
when they retorted by abuse. Burke shoitly
afterwards left the car, and the five followed him.
One struck Burke, whereupon the pugilist reached
out for the entire company, and having deftly
“ floored ” three of them, the other two departed
hurriedly.
Truth, while inclined to believe that in
Sherwln (and, perhaps, Pilling) an efficient substi-
tute could be found for Blackham behind the
wickets, cheerfully admits that England has not—
and, what is more, never has had—so deadly a
fast bowler as Spofforth, or so mighty a slogger as
Bonnor, with whom even Thornton in his best
days could not have compared for an instant. In
the matter of general batting, however, good as
Murdoch is, he does not equal several of our
cracks. M’Donnell, however, deserves special
mention as a splendid specimen of a very valuable
and rather rare type of batsman.”
There is a disease well-known in the hos-
pitals as “ housemaid’s knee,” brought on by too
much contact of the knees with hard substances
in washing, scrubbing, &c. A new development
of it, which merits the special attention of crick-
eters, is reported from Nottingham, where
William Oscroft, the famous professional—who is
well-known in Australia— is in danger of losing
one or both of his legs. Oscroft, whose cricketing
days ended a few years ago through ill health, was
out leg-before-wicket perhaps oftener than any
other well-known player of his generation, and
the result of much contact of the hard cricket-ball
with his legs has been to reveal a serious disease.
W. G. Grace, A. G. Steel, and others, whose beset-
ting sin is to place their legs where the bat should
be, had better beware.
Mr. R. H. English is now the world’s
champion bicyclist, and has beaten all records.
His speed comes nearer flying than anything else.
He has lately beaten by four seconds Kelth-Fal-
coner’s wonderful 5min. 36sec. for two miles, and,
riding straight on, has beaten Dr. Cortls’ record
for an hour’s ridel In a 15-mile race, with eleven
starters, he went right away from the start, and
won by 500 yards from the second man. Mr.
English rode the full distance, 15 miles, in 44mln.
29 4-5sec., and, finding that he was 8sec. ahead of
record, rode on. He finished 30 miles in 59mln. 6
3-6 sec,, and, in the full hour, travelled a distance
of 20 miles 560 yards. On his way he beat all the
performances from two miles upwards. He is a
north countryman, very much of the Cortis build,
and has risen at a bound to the top of the tree,
where he is likely to remain. He can certainly
beat 3min. 40sec. for one mile.
A Melbourne Sportsman man inter-
viewed Beach a couple of weeks ago—and a lot he
got out. f him. it must, Indeed, have been news
to the Sportsman readers when they heard the
Hanlan-Heach race was “straight as a die, ’ and
that, barring Clifford, Hanlgn was the grandest
rower Beach ever clapped eyes upon. But now
even this budget of news must have paled when
they read that, as a rower pure and simple—what-
ever that means—Rush capped the world. Beach
finished up the interview with the astounding in-
formation that he was sure to beat Hanlan, and
that he (William Beach) was no professional, but
a working blacksmith. The Sportsman then
stated that their reporter thanked Mr. Beach for a
cordial interview, and withdrew, but whether he
nominated his poison as rum and syrup or Bishop
Barker, the paper stateth not.
The sni-disant wife of Colonel Thornton,
in August, 1804, rode her husband’s Vingarlllo
against Mr. Elinc’s Thornvllle, a distance of four
miles at V ork. There were 100,000 persons present
and a detachment of dragoons had to be called in
to help the police in keeping the course clear. The
betting was 6 to 4 on the lady, and it was said that
£200,000 depended on tne result. Mr. Flint won on
his own horse, and pocketed the stake ofalCOOgns.
On August 24, 1805, Mrs. Thornton was engaged in
two matches. The first was for 2,000 guineas, half
forfeit, and four hogsheads of Cote Koti. In this
her opponent declared forfeit, and the lady
cantered over the course. In the next match
she rode a mare, Louisa, against Buckle, a well-
known jockey, on Allegro—distance two miles,
Mrs. Thornton carrying 9st 61b and Buckle 13st 61b.
The lady was dressed “ in a purple cap and waist-
coat, nankeen coloured shirt, purple shoes and
embroidered stockings.” An account savs that at

we may truly say. horsemanship, pushed forward,
and came in a style far superior to anything of the
kind we ever witnessed, gaining the race by half a
neck. The manner of Mrs. Thornton’s riding is
certainly of the first description ; indeed, her close
seat, and perfect management of her hoise, her
bold and steady jockeyshlp, amazed one of the
most crowded courses ever witness.-d.” At this
time Mrs. Thornton (otherwise Alicia Meynell) is
described as being about 33 years of age, very
handsome, of a fair complexion, light hair, blue
eyes, and very fascinating.
On Saturday afternoon, “Professor ”
Sample gave a performance in the presence of a
party from Government House, a crowd which
filled the marquee, and last, but not least we
trust, our humble selves. The flr.-t animal ope-
rated upon was a draught horse belonging to
Messrs. Goodlet and 8mith-an animal, it was
asserted, which had defied the farrier to shoe him,
without strapping, for the past 18 months. Under
the hands of the “ Professor, however, he showed
under entirely different colours, and allowed the
farrier to shoe him in the face of a large crowd,
not to speak of a flapping tent and flags. That
this was a genuine case there can be very little
doubt, considering the standing of the firm who
allowed their names to be used in connection with
it. Amongst other horses handled by the “ Pro-
fessor ” during the afternoon, was a wicked-
looking chestnut belonging to John Free, the
well-known Strawberry Hills ’bus propletor.
Free assured us that this horso, known in the
stables as “ The Terror,” was perfectly unmanage-
able until the “ Professor” laid hands on him last
Friday night, but that he was completely mastered
on Saturday afternoon, there can be no two
opinions, as he suffered himself to be driven round
the ring with a pole between his hind legs and
crackers and kerosene tins tied to his tail. Later
on, a pair of highly-trained mares went through
an interesting show, and the “ Professor ” finished
the entertainment by illustrating an easy and
effective way of throwing a horse. It speaks well
for Sample’s system when such a horseman as
John Free is a member of his class, a nd a staunch
convert.
The Daily News, in reviewing the Aus-
tralians' English tour, says that their visit was
brilliantly successful. In previous seasons, the
colonials played continually on wickets damaged
bv rain, while during the present summer they
have had continuous fine weather, hard, dry
wickets being the rule, and up to the last two or
three weeks a wet wicket the exception. This
season’s programme has also been the most am-
bitious yet attempted. That the men should have
gone through so much work, and yet at the end of
thirty-two matches be in full possession ot their
powers at all points of the game, is the best evi-
dence of their superb physique. But it w ould be
rash again to undertake a similar teat with only
thirteen players, including the manager. As the
Australians were beaten both times by the Not-
tingham professionals, the importance of their
victories over the Players is enormously dis-
counted. On the other hand, when the Australians
were beaten by the Gentlemen at Lord's, they lost
Spofforth’s services after about an hour s cricket,
and had to bat one man short. The South of Eng-
I land did not have their best eleven either at
Gravesend or the Oval, and the North gained their
two victories without in either case having the in-
valuable aid of A. G. Steel. Looking back upon
the whole tour, English cricketers have no reason
whatever to feel dissatisfied or disheartened. They
have no bowler to approach Spofforth, and no
wicket-keeper to compare with Blackham; but, it
we take away these two men and Palmer, we
practically exhaust the superiority of Australia
over rmgland Great as Spofforth s previous
achievements have been, however, his record this
season is a better one than ever. He has bowled in
finer weather a prams t much stronger sides than
before, and yet comes out with an Immense advan-
tage over his comrades. Altogether he has taken
311 wicsets at an average cost ot 13 76, and can show
a magnificent list of successes. Seeingwhathe has
none in a season of fine weather, it is only reason-
able to assume that had he been favoured with
the wet wickets which helped him in previous
tours he would have put all previous bowling per-
formances into the shade. No bowler can so
readily take advantage of any defect in the
ground, and It is perhaps In this particular that
his great superiority lies. Palmer, who would, by
the majority of English cricketers, be considered
as second only fo Spofforth, hasperhaps not been
so successful as was expected. He has only taken
127 wickets as against Spoff orth’s 211; nevertheless
he has done splendid work for the team. Haying
a special reputation for bowling well on fast true
wickets, it is always his lot to go on when circum-
stances are most favourable for run getting.
When the wickets are affected with rain he often
has to give place to Boyie. We may be wrong,
but we are of opinion that Palmer would be more
formidable in a team that did not Include Sppf-
forth. Were he the first bowler in the eleven in-
stead of the second, he would have choice of ends
—by no means an unimportant advantage—and
would always go on first when the wickets were
bad as well as when they were good. In oonflrina-
tlon of this Idea, we may point to his bowling for
the 1880 team after Spofforth had been disabled.
Onder no circumstances, however, do we think
that Palmer, in a long series of matches, would
ever be so formidable as Spofforth. He la not so
consistently good, nor does he possess the same
remarkable faculty of rising to the necessities of
a great occasion. It is the opinion of the best
practical cricketers—both English and Australian
—that, on a perfectly good run-getting wicket,
Palmer is the most difficult bowler in the world;
but he does not possess Spofforth’s capacity to at
once adapt himself to all variations of weather
and ground, nor has he so complete a mastery
over his pitch. Qlffen has been the third best
bowler in the team, and has on occasions done
very big things. He Is not ;an everyday bowler,
but he has his days ot conspicuous suc-
cess. In one match he Is almost unplayable,
in another he is the first to be knocked
off. It is his unquestionable distinction, how-
ever, to be the best all-round cricketer in the
Australian team. Boyle has suffered far more
than Spofforth, Palmer or Giflen from the continu-
ance of fine weather, He Is, and always has been,
essentially a slow wicket bowler, and the little
work that has been imposed upon him shows
more clearly than anything else the Immense
difference that has been experienced in the condi-
tion of the grounds as compared with the previous
tours. Boyle is the oldest member of the team,
and It is perhaps scarcely to be expected that he
will much longer be able to hold a place in repre-
sentative Australian elevens. On his own wickets,
however,;he is still a very effective bowler; and,In
proof of this, we need only refer to the England
match at Manchester and the North of England
match at Nottingham. As to batting, while only
five innings of over 100 have been played for the
Australians there have been twelve 100’s scored
against them. The batting honours of the tour
have been gained by Murdoch, M‘Donnell, Scott,
and Giffen. Bannerman shows a decided decline.
Murdoch himself has not been as consistently
successful as in 1883. In point of science, know-
ledge, judgment, and patience, however, he Is, as
he has been at any time since the summer of 1880,
considerably ahead of all other Australian bats-
men. M'Donnell has shown immense improve-
ment upon his previous play in England; he re-
tains his splendid hitting, and has displayed a
great deal more discretion. Scott has proved an
unqualified success; time after time he has played
a fine innings when runs were most wanted, and,
except Murdoch and Blaokhan, there is no bats-
man on the side who possesses greater confidence
at a critical point of the game. Bonnor has given
us some wonderful hitting, but remains much as
he was two years ago. As a whole, the batting ot
the team did not come up to expectations during
the first part of the tour, but got better and better
as the season advanced, and was at its very best in
August. The fielding has been less certain than In
previous tours —very brilliant at times, but occa-
sionally marred by serious blunders. Judged as a
whole, the tour has been a groat and genuine
success.
Rosamond de New South Wales to
Henry I.
Henry, ’tls past; thy membership is o’er,
And Tenterfleld can claim thy care no more;
No more can Speaker Barton proudly view
Thy towering form amid the scorned crew;
No longer may the morning Herald's page
Record thy speeches, fired with righteous rage.
How often, in thy sinuous career,
Have thy misdeeds surcharged my breast with
f ©fir I
How often would I willingly have checked
Thy efforts to embroil each snarling sect I
For I have seen that thy controlling power
Was ever greatest in fierce faction s hour;
And when religious jealousy was rife
Thy strength grew, in just measure, with the
j
And thou didst hold thy swelling crest most high
When thundering forth some sham religious cry,
Whilst thy ability was most displayed
When Orange lodges hailed each new crusade.
Henry, the history of Rome relates
That when that city envied distant States,
Her constant policy was to incite
Them to fierce warfare: and when.wasting fight
Had thinned their ranks and weakened their array,
I To make each one a scarce-resisting prey.
But in the glare of Romo’s Imperial might
Her crafty wiles elude our dazzled sight;
We view all nations bound, but still retrain
Prom asking by what tricks were forged their
chain. „ , .
Thy fate the same: my future sons shall see
The victories won, but not thy trickery;
Praise thee for triumphs that thy art obtained,
But never ask, “ How were those triumphs
gained;” ,, . .
Laud thee lor measures thy career can boast,
But never mention the Kiama Ohost.
Still must I praise the genius thou hast shewn
,1 wonder if those bills were all his own 7);
Still I admire the talent and finesse
Which engineered thy party to success;
But much I grieve that thou hast led the fire
Of pious malice and sectarian ire.
Yes. H( nry, it is well thou shouldst resign
The reigns of power to younger hands than
thine;
And I can almost view without a tear
Thy willing passage to a humbler sphere,
Nor would 1 wish thy presence to retain,
But a hen you ” cut,” dear Hal., don come

Last Thursday, the Sydney Liedertafel
held its smoke concert for the first time in the
Exhibition Building: and whatever the acoustic
defects of the place may be, it was the most com-
f ortable building the society has yet had as regards
space. About 15300 members and visitors were
present, and dispersed about the white-sanded floor
were 13tf tables, round which the chairs were drawn
by sociable little groups, who ordered their six-
penny “ nips 99 from the waiters flitting around.
Silence was kept during singing, and a request
was made that even matches should not be struck.
On such occasions the members do not dress.
There was, of course, room on the outskirts a n y
time, but anywhere near the platform the crowd
was as “ throng ” as it could be. The books of
words were very handsomely got up. A special
train was put on for the suburbs at 10.25 p.m., and
tram arrangements were specialised also. It was a
grand success.
* ♦ *
Miss Lily Gartoa’s combination troupe
gave a rather unique entertainment last week, in-
asmuch as all the performers were under 15
of »:ge. There was a a fair attendance, most of the
front seats being appaiently graced by the pre-
sence of Miss Barton's personal friends. Even the
chairman, Master T. C. Watson, was only a boy.
He did his duty well. The weakest part in the
programme was the recitations ; they were all
more or less sing-song, and though poMibly
gratifying to the parents and relations of the
youthful performers, were not good enough to
justify being given in public. Musical solos and
duets were given. Masters K. and H. Ingham, C.
Bray, W. Flynn, and Sparks, with their lungs and
Angers, and Misses L. M’Rae, Bella Pirie, and
Masters M’Rae and Sharp, with their legs, might
be called tbe main company ; and Miss Lilly
Gacton, the star. Among the latter’s varied con-
tributions were, the Flower ■song from Faust, a
dance song, a stage waltz, Irish Diamonds on the
piano, and a hornpipe. The young lady can do a
groat many things, but one thing she seemed
utterly unable to do —namely, look her audience
in the face. Her eyes never got beyond the edge
of the platform. A word to the wise is enough.
Dancing is Miss Lily's forte, and she is skilful at
it, and also facile at the piano ; but it she wants
people to like her, she really must look up. About
10 o’clock, chairs were moved, and a couple ot
hours’ adult dancing ensu<-d in the Protestant
Hail.

Botany may well be called the historic
bay wtien among its many memories are shrined
those of two such navigators as La 1 erouseand
James Cook—whose nations still honour their
names. Cook’s exploits have been lauded oft and
high; La Perouse’s name was, on Thursday last,
betlttingiy honoured by the pilgrimage made to
his monument by over a hundred French com-
patriots. Taking advantage of the Bruats pre-
sence in Sydney harbour, a number ot French
citizens invited the officers and men of that war-
ship to a trip to La Perouse, and with them went
pressmen and a few prominent persons, including
three Cabinet Ministers. A special tram from
town was met at Botany terminus by a steamer,
and in a short time the party was landed close
to the cenotaph that rises spire-like above the
sandy shore—the spot whence for nearly half
a century the last traces of the great I ronoh sailor
were known. The party gazed upon the stone, the
railing, the shore, and seawards, as if seeing in
their mental eye the stately ships sailing away to
be seen no more; and then after some wreaths had
been placed on the monument erected in 1835 to
La Perouse’s memory, several speeches were feel-
ingly made by M. Marquis, commandant of the
Bruat, M. Lucien Henry. &o. The tomb erected
to the French priest. Pare Receveur. who died on
the Astrolabe and was buried in 1788, was also
visited. All then returned to Botany proper,
where a banquet was laid at the Sir Joseph Banks
pavilion, anu M. Julian Decourt, French Consul,
took the chair. Further speeches were made, and
as ladles were present dancing followed till dusk.
The idea of the patriotic pilgrimage was a most
happy one, and no doubt will be long remembered
by the Bruat men.
It is not because girls are scarce at Bal-
main. It can’t be that. Possibly it may be that
some confiding young man has lately fallen into
the mesh of the wily mother-in-law, and the others
hold back to watch his fate-or it may be simple
economy ; but, somehow, young ladies were
rather few at the third Assembly Ball. Wo don t
know whose fault it was; whether they were not
asked, or would not come. But it could not be
the latter—we know Balmain girls better than
that. We have it on excellent authority, that one
whose company was besought only received five
days’ notice. Any young man who could be so
thoughtless as to expect a lady to settle her flutter-
ing mind about a ball—to say nothing ot re-
nouncing her war dress and fixing up a ttchu-ln
five days, deserves to go girl-loss the rest of the
season. But those who did go were loved all the
more for their scarcity, as well as for their other
good points. The local bevy Included a lively
brunette in black ; a Beattie-street captivator in
blue ; and two sisters in cream, one being set off
withteardinal trimmings, andjthe other topped up
with blue, both of Darling-street. A white dress
topped with marigold betokened a good dancer
from Campbell-street. Miss Williams also danced
well in a combination of garnet and pink
satin ; Miss Lewis, of Newtown, was a petite
blonde in pink; and Miss Wilkinsons cos-
tume of mauve satin bodice over cream veiling
skirt, was perfectly tasteful. Two sisters ot
Forbos-streot wore noticeable for feathery danc-
ing, and also because, while one was Amy-able,
the other had received at her Bertha more than
average share of beauty. Two other sisters, of
Darling-street, are known for dramatic capacities,
and while one takes leading parts with great
sweetness, the other is sometimes cast for roles
where she has to say little and look pretty, which
duty, we understand, she finds as easy as anything.
A pink charmer, though a Storm, was not a heavy
one; and it was peculiar, and even displeasing to
our sense of fitness, to find that one of the
daintiest little ornaments in the room was called
Vial. The name was quite inappropriate to the
chatty little brunette who has to carry it-at any
rate, until she gets a chance of changing. A dress
of terra cotta satin in long pleats set off with con-
siderable art and effect the natural advantages of
Its fair wearer, who camo from Sydney. Although
the music was a trifle variable, it was fairly good,
and Mr. 11. Hoop r had light duties as M.C. With
the help of Mr. and Mrs. Oldham’s excellent
supper table, the energies of the company were
kept In full play till past 4, when the rosy blushes
left the ladies’ cheeks to appear in the eastern sky.

The ball season is nearly over, but a ball
on Thursday next at Leigh House should not be
missed. It is organised by Dr. F. de Sylva, under
the patronage of the N.S.W Mauritian Anglo-
Franoo Mutual Help Society. Refreshments are
arranged tor, and either evening or fancy dress
may be worn.

Those festive persons, the Owls, held a
grand bal masque in Melbourne Town Hall last
Thursday. Eight hundred participated on the
floor, and several hundreds spectated in the bal-
cony at a cheaper rate. All was very complete.
The lamps were covered with coloured Owls, and
bird cages hung all round contained live birds.
Fancy dresses predominated. One gentleman made
up as an immense bottle representing Carlton
Pale Ale, and mysterious masks caused much fun.
There were a good many “sweet owl faces passing
to and fro ’’ in the throng. Several curious prizes
were awarded at midnight. That for best lady s
character was won by Miss Priestly, who went as
Bilverton; second, Cleopatra, by Mrs. Gough. Mr.
Longuehaye, as King .Pippin, gained the prize for
gentlemen. The most original character was
Young Australia, by Miss Simons; and the best
sustained Impersonations were respectively Mr.
Joseph Waxman’s Rip Van Winkle, and Miss Cor-
coran’s Folly. It seems a pity only one prize was
available for that favourite character.

Next Monday, a public picnic will be
given at Clontarf by citizens of Sydney to officers
of the Iroquois, American man-of-war now in
harbour. The Mayor will preside, and a number
of Sydney gentlemen who have travelled through
America are the leavening spirit of the committee.
It is intended to be a first-class picnic.
* m *
Fully 250 attended the Social at Nithsdale
on the evening of Monday, to close the holiday
with dancing. All were youthful and jubilant,
and good looks were quite fairly distributed.
Counting extras, nearly a score of dances were
played by Mrs. Bentley in her usual perfect time,
assisted by a Needs’ violin, &c.; and from end to
end the programme was thoroughly enjoyed.
Light refreshments were pretty heavily levied
upon. It is only seldom that an assembly, all so
nearly equal in youth and in dancing skill, is
gathered together, and no better close to a holiday
could be desired than one of these companionable
Cinderella parties, wnich provide a reasonable
amount of recreation without the fatigue which
generally follows a long night’s dancing in warm
weather. In the old country, there is a dancing
season. Here, there is none; for although
dancing is a winter pastime in theory, it is
actually carried on, as everyone knows, all the year
round in Sydney. Even in the heat of summer
many private parties are given, occasionally public
balls, and at numberless private picnics afternoon
dancing is carried on. It is rather peculiar that
while everyone avers dancing is not suited for the
warm weather, yet nearly everyone does it more
or less. Now, it seems to us that like a good many
other popular averments, this one is largely wrong.
One person says it because he has heard some one
else say it, and it sounds plausible. Why should
dancing not be just as rational in summer as in
winter ? Why is it that cricket, lawn-tennis, boat-
pulling, etc.—all far more violent exertion than
dancing—can be practised in summer? Simply
because people dress to suit their exertions. They
wear light, loosely-fitting flannel, soft and porous.
It would be Impossible to play cricket with vigour
in ordinary clothes. Yet people in an excessively
warm night in summer enter a ballroom in exactly
the same attire as they would don at a ball in mid-
winter. As at present managed, dancing is over-
warm ; but we fail to see why it should be. At pic-
nics the heat is modified by the free circulation
of plenty of fresh alr;-and there is no reason why
ball-rooms should not be constructed to admit of
this, too. We mean without walls. In China,
India, and other sultry climes, these buildings are
used, why not here ? With the cool night breezes
blowing throug h one of these Summer ball-rooms,
the cool electric light in pretty coloured globes,
cool conservatories open to the sky, and men and
women suitably attired—what would be more
pleasantly picturesque, or what more suited to an
Australian Summer’s night? Men are not obliged
to wear the same thick, impervious broadcloth
that is worn in wintry London. Much cooler
materials are available; Indeed, even now, dress
suits are being made of porous tweed to ensure
the comfort of coolness. Of course, ladies’ rai-
ment is a delicate matter, into which our natural
modesty prevents us making too close enquiry;
but from stray glimpses that have flashed upon us
at picnics, garden and tennis parties, of white arms
peering through gauzy lace and other light and
lovely materials, and fleecy skirts that absolutely
seemed to level in their own coquettish airiness,
we are sure ladles need not always wear heavy
dresses, and yet might be always just as charming
as It they did. A majestic woman, perfectly stiff
with brocades and velvets, may be a very imposing
object, but give us the tripping, skimming, chip-
pering little person that looks like a soft bundle
chiefly made of lambs’-wool and thistledown, and
who seems hardly to tread the floor. Of course,
it’s only seeming; but it’s a pleasant illusion.
Furthermore, the music and style of dancing are
quite capable of being modified for summer use.
Waltzes might with advantage be played slower;
food dancers would never grumble. Walking
ecently through a quadrille or lancers is not at
all violent exertion when done with correctness and
grace; but persons cannot expect to get otherwise
than warm when they grasp one anotner as if in a
Graeco-Roman wrestling match, and swing their
several selves round as if their existence depended
on their rapidity of rotation. Sometime, perhaps,
society will reform its summer dancing. Stop it—
it certainly won’t; the liking is too deeply rooted.
But, if it must be practised, surely there is no rea-
son why the style that grew in a totally different
climate should be slavishly copied here in Austra-
lia. But, wandering away on this new topic, we
forgot to finish the girls at Needs’s. One beauty
was delicious in pure white, the bodice of satin
and skirt of net, gloves to match. Two tireless
sisters, spirited dancers, were daughters of a nook-
seller—one in pink, one in blue veiling. A really
delectable dress was of corded figured silk, worn
by a quiet lady, with most delicate lace and flush
pink flowers. Glitterlngly brilliant was the dress
of a decided little blonde; it was white satin,
beaded in front, skirt be-laced and be-flowered,
and the arms were of lace embroidered with white
beaded leaves, etc. And a most peculiar dress,
entirely of cigar-coloured plush, convinced us
that its fair owner’s ideas would not agree with
ours as to what constitutes a comfortable dress for
summer dancing.

Government House Ball at Melbourne last
week, being the first given by Sir Henry and Lady
Loch, was a resplendent affair, and over a thousand
guests were present, including, of course, all
fashionable Melbourne. Most of the Ministry were
there, a number of officers, also Sir William
Robinson, Governor of South Australia, and Sir
George Strahan. Governor of Tasmania. Herr
Flock’s band played for the dancers. Lady
O’Loghlen wore a rich dress of orange satin, with
a petticoat of white lace over amber, and a bodice
and train of rich brocade. Her daughter, a nice
cream silk and embroidered gossamer. Mrs.
Donald Wallace looked extremely handsome in a
silk of delicate blue, the front trimmed with
bugles and plumes. Lady Nicholson’s daughter
wore only plain white satin ; and Miss Fairbairn,
a dress of cream docked with red ribbons. Mrs.
Graham Berry in black brocade, Mrs. H. Power in
a magnificent dress of cream figured velvet with
satin and lace, Miss Snodgrass in white satin and
golden Misses Desailly, Miss A’Beckett,
Miss O'Shanassy, Mrs. Carter in pale pink, Mrs. R.
Power and Miss French both in cream brocade.
Miss Stawell in pale blue tulle, Miss Fellows white
tulle, Miss Ryan white satin and tulle, were among
those present. Lady Clarke wore all cream, and
Lady Loch a cream satin dress flounced with valu-
able lace and trimmed with satin ribbon and
ostrich tips; long pointed corsage, cut low, also
decked with feather tips. Her two daughters wore
white silk and tulle. In the opening set, the
Governor danced with Lady Stawell, wife of the
Lieutenant-Governor, the other couples being Sir
W. Robinson and Lady Loch, Sir George Strahan
and Miss Robinson, Col. Brownrigg and Mrs.
Deakln, Sir W. J. Clarke and Mrs. Howard Vin-
cent, Mr, Doakin and Miss Smith, the Mayor ot
Melbourne and Lady O’Lughlen, Mr. Howard Vin-
cent and Lady Clarke. The ballroom was most
ornately prepared, and though a very spacious
suite or rooms was available, the affair was de-
cidedly crowded. The only toast at supper was
“ The Queen,” proposed by Sir Henry Loch.
m * *
Before the sports ended on the Agricul-
tural Ground there was a general look ot tired-
ness on the faces of most people. The gathering
on Prince of Wales’ Birthday showed more than
ever how welcome a stand would be with its back
to the sun. Not only would such be a comfort,
but it would be a great help towards ensuring fair
play and safety to both competitors and spectators
in the races. Stupid people were continually
crossing the track close in front of careering cy-
clists and whizzing horses at full trot. They
wander thus aimlessly about because they have no
comfortable place to settle and see the proceed-
ings. Shade trees would also be a great boon.
There are splendid capacities in the ground for an
unlimited crowd, when they are Improved, and
being so convenient to the city, the show ground
will always bo a popular resort.

The extraordinary event of a diamond
wedding, which so seldom occurs, was celebrated
last month at Campbelltown in Tasmania, and it
marked the 60th marriage anniversary of pro-
bably the most extraordinary man in that colony.
The Rev. Dr. Adam Turnbull was married in Scot-
land in 1834, but almost immediately afterwards
came out to “Van Dieman’s Land.” He was pri-
vate secretary to two Governors, Arthur and
Frankiin, and for years conducted the entire
correspondence with the English Government.
Dr. Turnbull achieved the great feat of thoroughly
mastering the three learned professions in theory
and practice—law, medicine, and the church. For
years he practised as a doctor; as a lawyer, he drew
up many Acts of the Tasmanian Parliament, in
which he laboured for over 35 years; and for oyer
30 years he afterwards preached as a Presbyterian
minister. It falls to few men to do as much, and
probably no man living has so much personal
knowledge of Tasmanian history, political or
social.

The hovering clouds blew off and left a
lovely day for the Balmain Regatta. A moderate
breeze suited both sailing and rowing races. The
flagship, the Messageries steamer Dupleix, was
crowded. Although a large boat, there did not
seem much room; promenading was reduced to
the process of slowly wedging one’s way through
the crowd, and the steamer is not favourably con-
structed for getting good views from. However,
there were a light refreshment counter, lots of
chairs, and the music of the Coldstream Band—so
time passed pleasantly on the sunny 10th. There
was not such a fine display of toilets as we have
seen at other regattas, nor was the Dupleix deck
best suited to show them, but some were
pretty, most neat, and all interesting in the
intervals of the racing. Eminently nice were
the white lawn costumes of two sisters, embel-
lished with live flowers, and two white lace hats
stuck all through with gold pins were the essence
of daintiness. The hats were Battenburg, which
are now growing very popular. A characteristic
costume was of drab satin pleated skirt, and a
polonaise of brocade in pale-blue and pale-gold
pattern, bonnet trimmed with forget-me-nots and
buttercups to match. Two cream cambrics, bme
spotted, were seasonable and pretty; and a charm-
ingly quiet dress was worn by a young lady whose
dove cashmere was just sparsely trimmed with
dashes of old gold ribbon. Inexpensive and un-
pretentious were two dresses of Galatea stripe,
worn by young girls—quite regatta dresses; and,
neatly made and modestly worn, they had
all the charm that good taste land neat-
ness convey. . A cream figured muslin
looked well under a Battenburg that was
bespeckled with sundry gold beetles and butterflies,
which interesting Insects proved that the young
lady was determined to keep up to the fashions.
A biscuit-coloured China silk dress was piped
effectively with red, and the small straw hat
adorned with popples was a good match. A radiant
girl wore a pale strawberry silk bodice and paniers
over an indigo skirt, which opened on one side
with serrated edges to show a continuation of the
strawberry down to the hem. Altogether, the
radiant girl was temptingly nice. Innumerable
boats pottered aimlessly around, as is their way at
regattas; and members of the fair sex might often
be seen digging an oar into the harbour with all
that wonderful lack of precision which usually
marks their efforts when they try to persuade
themselves they are rowing. But two young
ladies—one in purple and one in white attire—
each pulling a pair, displayed admirable form, and
attracted general notice from the flagship.

The Parramatta bazaar (for Wesleyan
Church) was one of the best there has been there.
Rev. J. Clifton opened it, and large attendances
soon decimated the wares on the stalls. Several
visitors came from Sydney, Including the Misses
Shipway and Slade, who gave some valuable
musical assistance, also that latest vocal luminary,
Mr. Quong Tart. Local aid to that portion
of the proceedings, was also efficiently given
by the Misses Tunks and Dunn, Messrs, Sparks
and M’Manis, and the pupils from tbe North
Parramatta Public School. The Misses A. and M.
Barker rendered some excellent pianoforte duets.
The dresses of most of the ladles were tasteful,
exhibiting every variety of colour. The belle of
the evening was a young lady from Summerhill, in
dark navy-blue velvet, the eldest unmarried
daughter of the ex-Mayor of Parramatta. The
eldest daughter of the Superintendent of the
Protestant Orphan School also looked exceed-
ingly nice in check silk over navy - blue
skirt. The three daughters of a resident school
inspector were very elegantly attired—the two
elder in rich brown velvet, and the younger in
peacock. The two fair pianoforte duettists, men-
tioned above, looked very attractive—the elder in
cream nun’s veiling, and the younger in light
blue—as did also a young lady from Hornsby, in
pale blue, who came with them. Two young
ladies from Harris Park, recent arrivals from
Kempsey, the elder in ruby and the younger in
myrtle green, were much admired ; and had there
been a prize for the prettiest child, it would cer-
tainly have been annexed by their little sister.
Two cousins from near the Western road,
alike in Christian name and surname, and
alike also in untiring efforts to effect sales, ap-
peared to Jgreat advantage—one in cream colour
trimmed with light blue, and the other in dark
green. Another young lady from Hassall-street,
apparently a great favourite, who worked inde-
fat igably at the left-hand end stall, wore an
elegant white silk, and with her were the two
graceful and ladylike daughters of the senior
district minister, in white and lavender. The
Cumberland Band was in attendance, and played
vigorously at intervals. The bazaar was liberally
patronised. It will leave pleasant memories, and,
what’s more, a good cash balance.

We ought to have mentioned last week
that the flowers, pot plants, &c., used to decorate
at the Ladles’ Ball, Glebe, were lent by Messrs.
Searle and Sons. Also, that Mr. A. Ickerson did
half the work of M.C.... At Lady Clarke’s ball, the
Footwoman of the Future, a character taken by
Miss Grice, was dressed in short quilted cardinal
satin skirt, and a coat of pale blue, the collar and
cuffs being white satin. Gold braid was used as
trimming, and a satin hat, three-corner shape and
combining the three colours, was worn — In Lon-
don, painting the face is becoming quite a common
custom among delicate young men in society, who
must be beautiful or nothing. But they can be
both....At Lady Loch’s At Home on Thursday,

EMMA BOYNTON.
A STORY OF GREAT SUFFERING.
I have been afflicted for one year and nine months
with what the doctors called rupla. I was taken
with dreadful pains In my head and body, my feet
became so swollen that I was perfectly helpless,
sores broke out on my body and face, my appetite
left me, I could not sleep nights, I lost flesh, and
soon became so wretched that I longed to die. In
this condition, after trying various remedies, I en-
gaged two homoeopathic physicians, Dr. and
Dr. , and was under their treatment a year
and a half, and failed to get even temporary relief.
My diseases grew worse; my sufferings became
terrible. I tried “ faith cure,” but was unsuccess-
ful. Kind friends then tried to get me into the
City Hospital, but the superintendent, after seeing
me, declined to admit such a case as mine there,
and said I would net live six weeks unless I was
relieved.
On the 30th of April last, I sent for Dr. F. M.
Blodgett, of Boston. He came, and after an ex-
amination pronounced my case the most hopeless
he had ever witnessed. My photograph, which
was then taken at his desire, while I lay propped
up In bed, shows the disease as it appeared on my
face: but no picture could possibly indicate how
much pain and suffering I endured. The eruption
had increased to great burrowing, foul-smelling
sores, from which a reddish matter constantly
poured, forming crusts of great thickness. Other
sores appeared on various parts of my body, and I
became so weak that I could not leave my bed.
In this condition, and by advice of Dr. Blodgett,
I began the use of the Cuticura Remepies, the
Resolvent internally three times per day, and
the Cuticuka and Cuticuha Soap externally. In
just sixty days, i. e, June 20,1 was so far recovered
as to be able to go alone to the gallery and sit for
my photograph, which shows more than words
can do the wonderful cure these remedies have
wrought in less than nine weeks. The sores have
all disappeared from my face and body, my appe-
tite and strength have returned; 1 am free from
pain, my flesh is increasing, and 1 can go about and
enjoy life. My restoration to perfect health is now
only a matter of a few weeks. My friends think
my cure miraculous: and I shall never cease to
feel that the Cuticuka Remedies have saved my
life.
EMMA BOYNTON, 39 Chapman Street.
Boston, Mass., July 17, 1884.
Knowing the composition and curative value of
the Cuticuka Remedies, I recommended them to
Miss Boynton, with the results above described. I
Indorse her statement as a faithful and true ac-
count of her sufferings and cure.

“Edith’’asks: “Would it be improper for me to
leave unanswered a letter from a young man
apologising for having taken a brooch, ear-
rings, &c., I having onlv seen him once 7” It
would depend on whether the young man
usually gets his living that way. We have
known young men take brooches, earrings,
&c., without anyone seeing them at all. The
case seems hemmed in with vagueness. Tell

Dearest Belle,—I received your letter from
Brisbane on Friday, which has filled me with con-
sternation. It appears that the draper kings are
up In arms about what I toid you oi their ways
up there. Now, nothing was further from my
thoughts than to hurt theii feelings, and really I
didn’t know there was anything disgraceful in ask-
ing a price for an article, and, it the customer
thought it dear, immediately offering it for half
the figure. Indeed, C thought it quite good-
natured and accommodating on their part, and I
can assure you it suited me exactly. But, from
what I hoar, some of the leading firms are quite
put out about it, and, of course, each one declares
that no such thing ever happened in their estab-
lishments, and it can only have been at some petty
shop, where a conscience is a thing unknown. But
truth compels me to say that, deny it as they will,
it was at one of the largest establishments in
Brisbane where I remarked this comical way of
doing business. I will even go further, and say
that it was not at our old friends, Finney, Isles,
and Co., which is far too honest and plain dealing a
firm to ask twice as much for their goods as it
would pay them to take. But there! if I say any
more I shall get into further disgrace, so I will
just leave the cap to be worn by whomever it may
fit.
I was glad to see so large an audience at the
second Vogrlch concert, for the attendance at the
first one was disappointing, although most of
the dailies pronounced it tolbe) large and fashionable.
But if the first was large and fashionable, the
second was certainly larger and more fashionable.
The opening piece, Scnumann’s “Grand Quin-
tuor,’’ was a positive treat to those who possessed
the capacity of enjoying the (beautiful work: as
the performance lasted thirty minutes, and per-
fect silence reigned in the hall throughout, It is
only fair to suppose that the audience was com-
posed of honest musicians. 1 wish, though, that
people wouldn’t applaud after each movement of
a work of this class; it does jar so on tho ear, and it
appears to me it is like interrupting the flow of a
narrative—you lose the thread as it were, and have
to “ listen back ” in order to know where you are.
Of course it is encouraging to the performers to
know that their efforts are being appreciated, but,
as a rule, our musicians are not so over-burthened
with modesty that constant applause is needed in
order to keep up their spirits. I don’t know
exactly how it is, but the more we hear Mons. de
Wlllimoff play the better we like him—his playing
I mean. On this occasion, his “ Elegie ” was so
well appreciated that ho was compelled to twice
bow his thanks to the audience : and really it was
played with that pure tone which so few manage
to coax from the violin, and with such delicious
expression that I should .have applauded myself
had I been a man. Brilliantly as Madame Vogrlch
acquitted herself in both recitative and air from
the “ Magic Flute,” and in the Jewel Song, I much
preferred her singing of Schubert’s “ Ave Marla.”
In the latter her voice sounded sweeter than
1 have ever before heard it, and altogether
with the piano and strings accompaniment, I can
tell you it was a gem. Herr Gumprich's 'cello solo
was rather indifferent; but I am sure he can
do better —Indeed, I know he can, for I have
heard him. He is always inclined to be just a little
mechanical, though. Liszt’s arrangement of the
Wedding March abounds in the most teazing diffi-
culties, which seem like mere child’s play to Herr
Vogrlch. His own “ Staccato Caprice” and Chopin’s
lovely “Berceuse” were bracketed together, mak-
ing a happy contrast of style. It was very gratify-
ing to notice at this conceit that Herr Vogrlch did
not find it necessary to interrupt Madame Vogrich
in her song in order that he might beg the ill-
mannered boors, who seemed to prefer the music
of their own voices to that of the lady’s, to be
silent. These concert-hall chatterboxes are becom-
ing more and more aggressive. I remember at the
Radclifl concerts they were extremely annoying;
and, if Mr. Radclifl had not been the most good-
natured of men—(fancy, he has been playing the
flute part in the Brisbane Musical Union orchestra
just to oblige them!)—he (would not have put up
with the annoyance so complacently. And, talking
of annoyances, did you ever, dear, have the dread
misfortune to sit near a lady at a concert who
fanned herself the whole evening through with
expression 1 The other night there was one sitting
just behind us, and the worst of it was her tan
squeaked with every movement. In the “ Ave
Maria ” the operation of the fan had a most comi-
cal effect. It started with, an adagio movement
and pianissimo in accordance with the music,
and thoigraduallaccellerando and crescendo were
really very fine, but the final diminuendo was best
of all, when the squeaks became fainter and more
faint, till at last they died away with the last note
of the song; and then for a’few precious moments
we had a rest from this dreadtul tan. The dear
Old lady seemed to enter into the spirit of ihe
music so thoroughly that we couldn’t feel down-
right angry with ner; and, besides, she looked so
wholly unconscious of the pain she was inflicting
upon us by her fantastical movements. Madame
Vogrich wore a beautiful white satin dress, with
very high Elizabethan collar. The skirt of the dress
was handsomely trimmed with white passemen-
terie and lace, and at the termination of the V-
shaped bodice was a beautiful bunch of real
flowers; silver necklet set with brilliants, and dia-
mond earrings. In the hall there was an extremely
handsome dress composed of black satin sprinkled
all over with tiny stars, worked in rose-coloured
silk. It was worn by a stylish-looking lady, and
was much admired. And, oh I there was the very
loveliest shot silk trimmed with pinked out
flounces. In one light it looked pink, in another
peach colour, and then, again, it shone a deep
purple. I think these snot silks are wonderfully
pretty; but Edith says they look so old-fashioned,
and declares tho only dress she can remember her
greatgrandmother wearing was a shot silk. She
admits that it makes a pretty trimming for a dress
of plain material, but as for having a whole dress
of the silk—oh, no! I know this, if anyone
offered me two or three shot silk dresses, I
don’t think I should refuse them ; but Edith
always was a slave to her prejudices. I saw
two or three of the new hair ornaments worn
the other night, and they were extremely
pretty. A large star, set with brilliants, is at-
tached to a small wire spring, which is then
fastened on to a long gold hairpin, which pins the
star on to the hair. Now, this little spring causes
the star to tremble with the slightest movement
of tho head, which gives it ten times the brilliance
it would have if it were stationary. I have seen
them crescent-shaped, b t prefer the stars.
Flowers in the hair are now almost unknown.
I am so glad ihe Liedertafel Smoke Concert is
over. Why? Well, because it’s pot the slightest
use our expecting to go out anywhere on those
nights, for there positively Isn’t an available man
to take us. They all go to these smoke concerts,
whether they ara musical or otherwise, because
“it’sthe thing, you know.” I heard Ned come
home before I went to sleep that night, and,
although 1 did not see him, I knew that someone
had been playing the clarionet well at the concert;
and also that some singer had made a success nrlth
“ The Last Watch.” And this is how I knew. In
the silence of the night I heard the not very mel-
low tones of Ned’s clarionet issuing from his room,
but, after a few vain attempts to play “ Still so
gently” without any “goose squeaks,” the in-
strument was laid aside, and in an uncertain bari-
tone—which might have been a good voice if he
had not tried to persuade it into being a tenor—he
sang “The Last Watch,” until he came to the
highest note, and then ihe rest was left to our
imagination. It’s a peculiarity of Ned's to try
and persuade himself that he can do things—no
matter what—as well as anyone else; but
he is not stubborn, and when he makes the
attempt he is soon convinced to the contrary.
So in the morning, I asked him who had
played the clarionet and who had sung “The
last Watch,” at the (concert. “Oh, Pier sang
and Cooper played, but how do you know
anything about it ?” “ I heard you trying to imi-
tate them both when you came home last night.”
Poor Ned turned red, for he knows we are aware
of his weakness, and exclaimed, testily, “I am
going to give up the clarionet and take to the
violin; Wlllimoff was grand last night,—yes, I’ll
try the violin, as for my voice, I don’t know what's
come over It lately.” , I suggested that there
might be something wrong with his larynx, but
my suggestion was treated with contemptuous
silence.
If ever I composed a song I should pray that It
might notjbecome too popular, for the very best
composition palls when one hears it at every street
corner. I don’t say that “Wait till tho clouds
roll by,” is the best thing ever written, but at
present the very atmosphere seems full of it,
there isn’t a larrikin who has left it unwhistled,
nor have the street musicians spared us--the very
dogs seem to bark it. It is just as much sung,
whistled, and played, as was “Nancy Lee,” when
the latter was at the height of Its popularity. It’s
certain death to a song to become so popular. So
if I had the gift of composition, I should prefer to
write a song similar to—well, Gounod’s “ Valley.”
for instance, which can never be vulgarised. By
the way, I have only heard the “ Valley ” sung
once in Sydney, and that was by Mr Hallewell, and
in his very best style, too; but I don’t think it was
appreciated as well as it deserved to be-so per-
haps that is why he has never repeated it. I wish
he would, though, sometime, for it is very beau-
tiful.
I wonder when we are going to get some “ tea-
on-the-lawn ” days. Here we are into November,
and the weather as uncertain as an English April,
which makes garden parties complete failures, and
moonlight picnics ditto. But it appears to me I
have written you a long letter, and now I haven’t
told yau anything about our lovely summer cos-
tumes. But that will wait till next time, for I am
really tired.
Ever your loving

Sydney, Wednesday.


Political Points
A South Australian politician said, “ Capi-
tal would employ monkeys if they would work.”
The attention of The O’Sullivan is directed to this.
The New South Wales Ministry certainly
got “a facer” over the Mudgee-Walgett line.
But, in Victoria, the Service-Berry Ministry got
just as heavy a knock on the Ballarat East to
Bunlnyong line. And both Ministries are still in
existence.
When poor little Andy Lynch was alive,
he at times told the New South Wales Assembly
that he “ riprlsinted the grate intayrlor.” This,
however, does not justify the theological joke
made by the Protestant Standard, when it said
that Andy had left the world and gone to his con-
stituency.
In the South Australian Parliament last
week, Mr Kings aid he intended to vote “ against
his conscience.” And the House laughed. Now,
members need not have laughed. Everywhere in
Australia legislators vote against such conscience
as they have, but it is very seldom that one of
them admits doing so.
So soon as half the officials in the Lands
Office in Bridge-street have been drafted into the
country, the outlying branches of the department,
which are here, there, and everywhere in Sydney,
will be brought under one roof. To persons having
business with the Lands Department, this will save
expense, but not time. Now, you have to go round
from one office to another in a cab. Presently, you
will merely have to sit for hours outside one official
door, and walk ten yards to do the same outside
another.
One broad feature will be found in the
Local Government Bill of the Stuart Ministry. It
will be compulsory in this way. Not a district in
which land is held by lease or freehold will obtain
the smallest subsidy from Government, unless as
a supplement to local taxation. And Government
will carry out no works in any district, except such
as ate of a purely national character. Within
municipalities and settled districts, too, the license
fees and other revenue that goes to the Crown will
go to the local governing body. But, in the back
country, it is possible that local government may
Still be accompanied by a central administration.
In Wilkie Collins’s novel “The Law and
the Lady ” there is a rather crapulous character
who has no legs, and wheels himself about on a
mechanical chair. The New Zealand Treasurer,
Sir Julius Vogel, has the usual number of legs,
but so full of gout are they that he has to wheel
himself in and out of and about the Chamber of
Representatives in a chair like that of Wilkie
Collins’s gentleman, who, by the way, liked truffles
stewed in champagne, and shared a taste, therefore,
with Vogel. Sir Julius has to speak from his chair,
which is softly cushioned—that is more than his
speeches are. In his old style, he has so cast out
political baits in all directions that the different
parties opposed to him are broken up, and he has a
majority at his back.
The people of the Hailing and the Lower
Murrumbidgee look to Federation for advant-
ages that they can never get from Sydney,
and undoubtedly they can make out a good case
against our pedlar-like centralising policy. We
pose ourselves as chatnpioos of Freetrade, and
we interpret the doctrine by barring all traffic
that does not lead direct to Sydney stores. The
people of Hay and Deniliquin have for years
desired to make a railway at their own cost,
and our Government refuses permission, because
“the policy of New South Wales is to bring all the
wool to Sydney.” The tyranny and impudence of
this avowed principle will road very badly in
history, and, indeed, will make us look very queer
if it gets into the Home papers.
Dailey believes that the adoption of the
Convention Federation policy would secure the
lands, lives, and liberties of the immense popula
tion of Polynesia, prevent schemes of plunder,
and lay the foundations of justice. Now, one who
can believe that will believe anything. We should
like to hear Tawhiao’s views on the subject, or
those of the chief whose village the merry men
of the Miranda burnt and “ looted ” the other day.
The security and justice which flourishes under
the meteor flag may be all very well for mission-
aries, syndicates, and the commercial runners of
wooden nutmegs; but for the autochthyon it
simply means white spirit spoliation and sudden
death. The nigger, in fact, might sing with much
appropriateness: “ You will skin me with your
f eder’’-atlon.
Herr Rauspaoh’s invention of a wild-beaat-
taming electrical baton might be applied, we con-
ceive, with considerable advantage in .parliamen-
tary procedure. For example, were the Speaker,
the Chairman of Committees, and the Sergeant-at-
Arms supplied with a Rauspach baton a piece,
there might be some chance of bringing
obstreperous members, if not to order at least to
comparatively useful motionlessness. Wo can
fancy Buchanan, stupefied by a shock, crouching
in his seat; A. G. Taylor perfectly numb; Parkes
growling fitfully, but subdued ; Garrett showing
his teeth, but silent; and Wisdom on his back, a
child again, earnestly endeavouring to get his big
toe in his mouth. In the hands of really impar-
tial officials, and employed faithfully to tame
blatant bores and bullies only, the baton would
•• pa y "—the want, however, is the,really impartial
officials.
The German General von der Goltz main-
tains that in the next invasion of France, cavalry
must be employed on a great scale, and that
serious battles ot cavalry and horse-artillex-y alone
may be expected. In the recent manoeuvres, the
great position was assigned to the cavalry, which,
on the first day, had all the work to do, not a rifle
being fired; the whole of the infantry was em-
ployed in “ mere strategical manoeuvring.” It is
known, moreover, that the one great (reliance of
the Russian staff;against German Invasion is on
the great number of cavalry they habitually keep
ready for concentration in Poland. Germany can-
not rival them in this arm. If this news is correct,
the revival of cavalry campaigning will greatly
increase the expense of armies and the calamities
of war. Cavalry can never .be cheap, and a mass
of cavalry moving in an enemy’s territory must
desolate it as would a flight of locusts.
Apropos of the sullen and hostile attitude
of the people of the South of Ireland during the
Viceroy's visit, thus the London Echo:— “The
Land Act and the Arrears Act are forgotten in the
remembrance of the coercive legislation for which
Ministers are responsible. Nothing that they can
do can reconcile the Irish people to an Adminis-
tration that threw a thousand (citizens into gaol
and kept them there for months without trial or
evidence of guilt. Mr. Justin M'Carthy has re-
cently published calculations which show that Mr.
Parnell will have a following of nearly eighty
members in the nex r Parliament, and other autho-
rities are of much the same opinion. Should this
happen, it will be largely due to the folly of Liberal
Ministers who listened to Tory counsels, and, in-
stead of being true to Liberal principles, sus-
pended the Irish Constitution, and left Irishmen at
the mercy of any hireling who chose to swear
away their liberty.”
By direction of the Speaker a piece of
furniture is to be placed in the New South Wales
Legislative Chamber which he expects will have a
decidedly beneficial influence on the temper and
tone of debates. A “ Luger Messer is to be hung
from the ceiling.” Perhaps people will ask “ what
is a Luger Messer?” Well, in Bohemia, when a
number of village cronies are talking politics and
drinking beer, there is suspended from the ceiling
of the room a large knife with a lot of little bells
about it and a string hanging down by which it
may be shaken. Then when one of the company
says something from which some one else differs,
the party who differs does not get up and say
“ you’re another.” No, he just pulls the string and
the knife shakes and the little bells ring, and the
gentleman making the statement is expected to
substantiate, explain, or apologise for it. There
can be no doubt of the theoretical utility of a
Luger Messer in our Assembly. It will come in
very handy for Sir John Robertson, M'Elhone, or
A. G. Taylor, if they like to use it. That’s the
point, however. Sir John says that whon he wants
to say “ It’s a lie,” he prefers saying it right out
and not ringing a lot or infernal little bells. And
M'Elhone and Taylor are much of the same
opinion. Then there are quite a number of mem-
bers, such as Abigail, Lusoombe, and R. B. Smith,
who would like to say “you’re a dam liar,” or
“ it’s a dam He,” but refrain from moral considera-
tions. Now, these gentlemen, it is thought, would
be always ringing the Luger Messer as something
is being always said that they would like to con-
tradict. However, a very few days after the
opening ef next session will settle whether the
Speaker’s new notion is a good one or not.
It is said that the Land Boards will possess a
great deal more of Independent executive power
than the Minister intended. The section of the Act
dealing with the constitution of these bodies is
being carefully overhauled, and it is found that
when organised in strict terms of the Act, the
Boards will be, in the first Instance, entirely in-
dependent of Ministerial control, and the publicity
which is essential in every stage of procedure
will afford a strong guarantee against subsequent
abuse. Years ago, Sir John O’Shanassy had a
disputed portion of land allotted to him in one
day at the Central office. The purchase was com-
pleted, and the Deed Issued at once by Ministerial
flat, while the dispute was pending. Such a gross
perversion of law can hardly occur under the new
Act. Mr. FarneU is reported, Indeed, to have said,
lately, that “ the Chairmen of Boards would take
the orders from the Minister, exactly ai Land
Agents did under the abolished Act,” but it ap-
pears that he is greatly mistaken—so much the
better, say we. In view of the decentralisation
contemplated, the department is in a state of
panic. The hundreds of youngsters, who, as State
paupers or legacies from thejvarlous Ministries,
have been kept by the public for the last ten
years, have now the alternative before them of
going up the country to work under the Land
Boards, or of getting their noses kept to the
grindstone In Bridge-street, working up the
arrears of the old Acts. The vision of “the
sack ” in the back-ground, will, no doubt,
stimulate them to a speedy comprehension of the
new law. It is quite evident that the “Govern-
ment stroke” must be quickened : and whatever
may be the defects of the Act of 1885, it will
deserve our blessing if it infuses order and activity
into the Augean stalls of “the Lands.” It is said
that there will be fifteen or sixteen Land Boards,
each supervising a local department consisting of
land-agents and surveyors, and holding open
courts all over their district at stated intervals.
This is essentially the same method that has been
in operation in Queensland since 1868 : and there it
has worked with such good results that in ad-
ministering a territory twice as large as New South
Wales, there are no arrears, and all Information
can ;be got at once, both at the local and the
central office.
Hurlbert,Elate editor of the New York
World, has just written a pamphlet reviewing the
main Incidents of Blaine’s nine months’ tenure of
office at the U. 8. Ministry of Foreign Affairs from
March 4th until December 1st, 1881, and in which
Blaine is specially charged with having system-
atically disregarded the claims of American
citizens who were arrested in Ireland under the
Coercion Act. The chief interest in this publication
is the fresh light it throws on the circumstances of
Buckshot Forster’s retirement from the Chief
Secretaryship of Ireland. Hurlbert shows that
this retirement or dismissal was due to no other
cause than the energetic attitude assumed by the
United States Government after the dismissal of
Blaine by President Arthur and the accession of
Frelinghuysen to office. Frelinghuysen cabled,
March 3,1883, to Lowell (American Ambassador in
London):—“ Use all diligence in regard to late
cases, and report by cable.” Lowell did so, and
received in reply the following message“ The
President hopes that the Lord Lieutenant will be
instructed to exercise the powers entrusted to him
by the first section (of the Coercion Act) to order
early trials in all oases in which Americans have
been arrested.” Lord Granville found that the
? retention of the rights of American citizens in
reland had come into the hands of an American
secretary who was not to be trifled with. He re-
plied the same day, and assured Mr. Lowell that
the matter would receive Immediate atten-
tion. He was as good as his word. A
Cabinet Council was summoned and Forster
invited to communicate with the Lord Lieu-
tenant, and ask him to exercise his discretion in
the sense desired. This Forster refused to do.
The American Government took an unusual step.
They called in the unofficial aid of Hamilton Fish,
ex-8ecretary of State. Fish sent a cable despatch,
at the request of the State Department, to an
eminent British public man, who was authorised
to show it to Gladstone, to the effect that if any
further delay occurred In complying with the de-
mand of the United States In regard to the Ameri-
can suspects, that these suspects should be re-
leased at onoe or at once put upon their trial, the
relations between Great Britain and the States
would be very seriously strained. This despatch
was immediately imparled to Mr. Gladstone, who
saw himself confronted by a new and most formid-
able complicatio n of the Irish question. He made
up his mind. Fish’s despatch was laid before the
British Governm ent on April 2nd; on the 4th Fre-
linghuysen was able to announce that all the
American suspects had been released. Forster
ceased to represent coercion In Ireland from the
day the Fish desnatch arrived, a fact borne out
by the events which followed. Parnell and his
companions were unconditionally released, despite
the strenuous opposition of Forster, who still
clung to office. It was determined to force him
to resign the Ministry he had so nearly wrecked.
Michael Davltt was unconditionally released.
There was nothing left for Mr. Forster but to re-
sign.

There is just the off-chance that the
simple-minded citizens of Gundagai will shortly be
left to the tender mercies of the erudite Elworthy
in the matter of local Journalism, as the only w.
H. L. Bailey has intimated in a late issue of the
lively sheet which bears his imprint that, if his
subscribers do not ante-up with the overdue
stamps, he will withdraw the light of his counten-
ance from among them, and leave them in well-
merited obscurity. Sad tidings these for the Gun-
dageese. And. to add to their discomfiture, he
points out, with painful lucidity, the deplorable
position in which the district would be placed
should the Herald (which hitherto—to quote the
Immortal one—“ has been a power in the land ”)
cease to circulate. In a leading article, couched
in vigorous Anglo-Saxon, and frescoed with
foreign quotations, the aggressive W. H. L. jumps
on the neck of his contemporary bv holding up
to a discriminating public his vaccinating policy
anent a railway to Tumut or somewhere. This
is the cheerful style in which Bailey opens out:—
“ We have so continually pointed to our con-
temporary, the Gundagai Times, as a servile lick-
spittling journal, entirely devoid of backbone and
principle, that we begin to think the proprietor of
it must have the skin of pachyderm, else, for
decency's sake, he would not continue displaying
his chameleon-like colours in so barefaced a man-
ner.” Now, isn’t that a start quite good enough
for anything? And then he proceeds to show by
almost damning evidence that, like Sir Boyle
Roche’s famous bird, the editor of the Times
could not be enjoying the mild dissipations of the
metropolis, and grinding out brilliant editorials in
his Gundagai sanctum at the same time, and he
further draws aside the veil of the sanctum sanc-
torum ruthlessly, and discloses what he cheerfully
calls “the ruse dc guerre of sacking the editor,”
to whom the credit of writing some of the leading
articles of the Times had been ascribed. Seriously,
we cannot see how the people of Gundagai can
afford to lose that doughty champion of their
interests whose power of invective is only equalled
by his gigantic stature and an abnormally big hat.
Even though it should be converted into a gratuit-
ous ad. we are reluctantly compelled to admit that
there is a lot of wholesome fun in the Gundagai
Journals-a bit personal may-be, but what of
that ?
Here’s a bit of the plainest sort of English,
which we commend to the best attention of the
Postmaster-General. A subscriber sends it along:
—“ Could diggers and other bushmen be assured
that their newspapers would come through all-
right, your circulation and that of other leading
weeklies would, I am sure, be largely on the In-
crease. The other day a timber-getter wanted the
loan ot my Bulletin, and in lending it to him, I
inquired why he didn’t subscribe to it. He said
he and his mate took it and the T. and C. Journal
for upwards of twelve months, but getting little
more than half the papers they were entitled to,
they became disgusted and ceased to subscribe. I
have heard similar remarks made in many parts
ot the Australias by many and various men. Pic-
ture to yourself a poor, worn-out old digger—per-
haps a forty-niner—ending his days on a Chinkee-
fossicked field. He makes, say, two weights a week.
Out of such a pittance ho has to support himself
and his two friends, probably the only real friends
he has in the world, his cat and dog. This worn-
out man on a worn-out goldfield. The man and
the goldfield typical of the stirring past, both soon
to be numbered amongst the tdings that were.
Such as he will subscribe to a paper. That and his
pipe are the only luxuries he enjoys. He may now
and again pinch his guts to pay for it. His boots
may be rotting off his bleeding feet, but he’ll try
to await another washing and make sure of the
paper. What a darn shame that such as he should
be robbed by a pitiful set of State parasites—dudes
who dissipate their time and dimes in billiard-
rooms, &c. Here is an Instance: I knew a store-
keeper who had occasion to go to Sydney; not
being a drinking man, he hung up at a swelHsh
kind of boarding-house. The place jamful of young
snobs, swells, and other dudes. The whole blasted
fit-out was barnacled on to some part or other
of the State ship. One night, some hair-pin begun
to read a humorous yarn about an old nigger out
of on© of the evening papers. The joke had been
quoted from the Detroit Free Press. The atore-
R60P er remarked that he would like to see a copy
of that paper. ‘Would you?’ said the cove who
sat beside him on a sofa. ‘ I often get one. I can
get almost any kind of rag I want, at any time. I
fetch plenty here, but the fellows take them to
the rooms and they are lost sight of.’ The Post-
uffle® was the department honoured by the services
of this particular snoozer. Country Post Offices
are pasted over with directions signed by the
Postmaster-General, in which he indirectly admits
that his department is chock-full of thieves.
The public are warned to be careful in registering
letters, in cutting bank notes in two, etc., which
seems to me to read like a humiliating admission
that are many prigs: in the Post Office. Is there no
remedy for it ? Will there always be thieves in
the Post Office? Then why not get rid of the
whole roost of paid prigs, and run the concern with
a cheap staff from Darllnghust Gaol. I don’t, for a
moment, cast the slightest reflection on the little
Post Office here, I got eleven papers out of a
possible twelve in the last quarter, and I’ll swear
the twelfth got lassoed before getting here.” Our
correspondent is too sweeping. That there are
thieves in the Post Office is sufficiently proved by
the periodical detection and conviction of “ well-
connected ” prigs. But it would not be fair, there-
fore, to brand the entire body of Post Office
officials as dishonest. There are black sheep in
every establishment, and in the Post Office temo-
tations are considerable, and detection perhaps
more frequent than in most other departments,
owing to the very carefulness of the observation
to which the employes are subjected.
The World says that the priests of the
Anglican Church who contrive to get into trouble
are alarmingly on the increase, and though a
blameless majority should not be reproached with
the criminality of a minority, the scandal grows.
No one can observe the ecclesiastics without being
struck by the vulgarity of their appearance, and
the meanness of their habit. The Irish R.C. clergy
are sneered at as an underbred peasant priesthood,
yet the average Anglican parson, whose acquaint-
ance we casually make, does not contrast so very
favourably either with them or with foreign ec-
clesiastics. Cleanliness la cheap, yet the parson of
the period eschews it as if it were one of the seven
deadly sins. Nothing can be in worse taste than
the misshapen felt hat, surrounded by a triple or
quadruple belt of black cord, which surmounts
the clerical head. Twenty years ago no English
clergyman would have permitted himself to ap-
pear in public habited after so uncouth a fashion
—with coat that has never known the brush, linen
that is a stranger to the laundress, and hands
never encased in glove or apparently dipped in
water. Police reports show that he is sadly ad-
dicted to getting into scrapes, so is not to be won-
dered at If he provokes many base imitations.
“Clerical imposture” is now the stereotyped
heading of newspaper paragraphs. A tioket-of-
leave man. noticing the disrepute into which the
ecclesiastical profession;; has fallen, and the ab-
sence of anything like distinction in so large a
proportion of those of whom it is composed,
naturally sees no reason why he should not assume
the priestly role. He is probably as well born and
bred as the curate of the new school, quite as well
educated, not more devoid of moral principle,
with far more strength of character, ingenuity,
energy, and resource. A sham divine is often no
worse than the real article. If there still existed
the difference which there once used to be between
the latter and a Hyde Park preacher, there would
be fewer counterfeit (presentments. But, just as
every small farmer’s daughter wants to be a go-
verness, so ihe son of every small tradesman
wants to be a parson—not that his aspirations are
spiritual. This is the age of social pushing; the
Church offers a respectable and easy career, and is
open to all. A University degree Is no longer
essential. Formerly the fool of the family
was sent Into the army; nowadays the fooi
or the sluggard shuffles Into the Church.
The typical newly-fledged parson has no wish to
come to the front. He has neither pluck nor
spirit, power of application, nor go. He is a poor,
invertebrate, weak-kneed creature, morally and
physically limp, with an Ignoble fondness, not so
much for ease and comfort, as for torpor. His one
idea and object is to exert himself as little as pos-
sible, to do the least he can, and to do it in the
most slovenly fashion that will pass muster.
Better a curate’s £120 a year, as it seemkto him,
than the £250 which his brother may be earning as
a schoolmaster or as a Government clerk. Clergy-
men can generally make their work what they
wish It to be. So long as they do not violate public
decorum, and keep out of the county court, the
police court, and the newspapers,’.they may scamp
their work at will. Their stipend is paid regularly,
and if they can sleep ten hours out of the twenty-
four, and eat three square meals a day, they are
satisfied. Now, the World Is, taken allround, a
most respectable paper, and is extensively read by
the aristocracy, to whom it considerably “kow-
tows.” Did we see such a diatribe against the
clergy in a “low ” Radical paper, we could under-
stand it, and make the necessary allowances. But
when we find the fashionable papers agreeing with
papers that are not fashionable, on the subject of
the clergy, what are we to conclude ? In at least
some parts of Australia, we are glad to see, a Uni-
versity degree is a sine qua non for ordination to
the Church of England. And common fairness
compels us to say that you rarely meet in Aus-
tralia a Church ot England clergyman who is not a
gentleman.
MONEY AND TIME SAVED.
Messrs, thomas hendersov and co„
Agricultural Machinists, of 89, 91, 95 Bliza-
beth-street North, Melbourne, furnish us with
the following combined statements received from
some of their employes, under date 26th January,
1884 :—Mr. William Downes says : “ With pleasure
I bear testimony to the efficacy of St. Jacobs 0i'
as a household remedy. One application I have
found to totally remove the pain and marks of a
severe bruise, and I believe ft to be an Invaluable
remedy for sprains. Since experiencing its good
qualities I have recommended it to several friends
for neuralgia, soreness of chest, &c , and in every
instance it has given relief.” Mr. w. A. M'Horg,
accountant, contributes the following statement:
“ I sprained my ankle very badly. I tried the
efficacy of St. Jacobs Oil. My ankle was greatly
swollen and painful, but after the first application
the swelling had sensibly decreased and the feeling
of stiffness entirely gone out of my leg ; in fact,
a week’s daily application of the Oil effected a
complete cure, and I had not to remain away a
single day from business. (A friend of mine, afte
seeing my ankle, prophesied three weeks’ deten-
tion at home.) I believe the Oil to have great
curative power for sprains, and that it possesses
the properties claimed for it.” Mr. R. W. Johnson,
fitter, sprained his ankle severely. He applied St.
Jacobs Oil with the most beneficial results. In less
than a week it has made a perfect cure, and he
was not absent from work for a single day. He
has also used It for toothache, which it cured
almost at once. He recommends ftto all sufferers.
Mr. John M'Intyre, carpenter, in our employ,
speaks of its virtue. . . . Having sustained a
severe fall on my back, I was, through tne injury,
half paralysed, I tried St. Jacobs Oil, and after
using two bottles I found muen relief. My arms,
which I could not raise above my head after the
fall. I can now use freely, and can go about my
work as well as ever. I look upon the Oil as 8
most valuable medicine. *

Ulcers broke out on my body until I was a mass of

At times could not lift my hands to my head,
could not turn in bed; was in constant pain, and
looked upon life as a curse. No relief or cure in

Remedies, used them, and was perfectly cured.”

neuralgia in her face if she uses it, and
others state that by a few minutes’ brush-

WOOD AND COAL AND GLORY.
There lives —and lives well, we dare to say
—In one of the suburbs of this city a wood and
coal merchant who has solved the secret of making 1
the best of this world and the next. He has united
godliness and gain, the pursuit of wealth and the
hunt for heavenly glory, in a manner most ad-
mirable and edifying to see. We have one of his
bills before us for a ton of coal a , n d
ten-inch firewood—not a bill against us, it is need-
less to state ; the days of our credit are oyer, bo
far for the affairs of this world and the lust for
lucre that is filthy. But the compromise with the
other world is the more interesting. The ingeni-
ous coal and wood man effects this by a border of
texts all round the bill. We quote from that
before us—“The wages of sin is death. This
text is at the top of the page. At the sides
“Verily, verily I say unto you, he that heareth
My word and believeth in Him that sent Me hath
everlasting life” —and one or two others that, as
associated with an account for fuel, are suggestive
In the extreme. This is truly a novelty in the way
of religion, and might not inaptly bo termed an
attempt to take the Kingdom of Heaven
by cunning. And why should not salva-
tion be worked out in this way ’
of In fear and trembling, or blood and fire /
We have always thought it due to the intellect
and the civilisation of this century that a more
artistic method of approaching tbe problem of
Immortality should be invented. And behold it is
an accomplished fact. We can all now paddle
serenely and easily over the Sea of Life, satisfied
In our minds that, sooner or later, we shall reach
the Golden Shore. The grocer need have no
qualms of conscience now about adu Iterating ms
sugar as long as he wnps it up in a paper embei-
lished with moral maxims and scriptural quota-
tions. The lawyer can send In without scruple a
colossi bill of costs, heading it with one of the
beatitudes, and footing It with a verse of the
psalms. Even we see a chance now for a humble
place somewhere near the celestial gatehouse,
where we can make a modest living by warning
8t. Peter when the Protestant Standard people,
or any other people who have no business there,
strive to squeeze through the bars. A11 we have to
dots to print a pleasant reference to Pastor Allen,
or an occasional t ribute to the piety of Peter Camp-
bell (now, or lately, i ‘ vaol), to counterbalance the
wickedness (are we really wicked, do you think ?) of
the rest of the paper, and the thing is done. What
tun we should have, to be sure I We would
gravely shake our beads, and say that they had
made a mistake in the place, when a party of
round-paunched, reverend saints camo to.the gate
with their good deeds in a Gladstone travelling-
bag, and asked for admittance. And while they
paused in perplexity, we would go out through
the wicket, closing it carefully alter us and put-
ting the key in the lining of our crown, and politely
point out to them the way they should have taken.
Then we would softly return and tell the whole
story to a select circle of seraphic wags over a keg
of ambrosia. Or when one ot his own race tried
to obtain entrance surreptitiously, w® would
whisper the fact to St. Peter, who would come out
with his sword and cut the intruder’s nose off (Peter
but off the ear of the High Priest’s servant once),
which we would use as a halo-peg. Oh, we can
tell you there would be gay old doings around the
Golden Gate if wo were located anywhere in the
neighbourhood. We should be among strangers
of course, but what of that? We could soon
make ourselves at home, and we could always
send down messages to our friends by passing
caravans. And this brings us back to the astute
wood-and-coal wrestler for perishing pomp and
Immortal glory. It brings us back with the con-
viction that he will get both, unless his little game
becomes too palpable and is prematurely crushed.
And we see no reason why it should be, unless
Providence has become more sophisticated of late.
We see no reason, indeed, why he should not. If he
choose, supply hell with fuel while he palliates
heaven with texts. In fact, as his accounts would
be rendered to the devil with a rich embroidery of
saving texts, we think he would be fairly entitled
to a halo as large aa a cart-wheel for his splendid
audacity in attempting to convert the Father of
Evil himself. And now, after all this, we think
that he (the. wood and coal man, not the devil)
should send us round a load of firewood without
the usual sordid accompaniment. we have a
stock of bills, and we don’t want the texts.

NEVER previously did any piano win such a hold
on the public as the Miguon has done since
its introduction. Our competitors have no doubt
done their level best to rival us—blazoning forth
their bald imitations with a tremendous flourish
of trumpets. What result have they to show,
excepting to point to the gradual death of all their
offspring? The reason is soon found. Inferior
instruments, with showy exteriors, have been
brought forth and attempted to be foisted on the
public. But the right-thinking public will have
none of them. The consequence is that the
Sales off the Piano
have Trebled.
THE MIGNON PIANO
has found its way into every town almost of all
the colonies—In Victoria and New South Wales,
from north to south ; to the far north of Queens-
land ; in Now Zealand, from one end to the other
of the islands. In South Australia and Tasmania
THE MIGNON
can be found, and its name is really a household
word.
THE MIGNON PIANO
is the people’s favourite.
THE MIGNON PIANO
for its size defies all would-be imitations.

Cherry Pectoral.
No other complaints are so insidious in their
attack as those affecting the throat and lungs:
none so trifled with by the majority of suffer-
ers. The ordinary cough or cold, resulting
perhaps from a trifling or unconscious ex-
posure, is often but the beginning of a fatal
sickness. Ayer’s Cherry Pectoral has
well proven its efficacy in a forty years’ fight
with throat and lung diseases, and should bo
taken in all cases without delay.
A Terrible Cough Cured,
“ In 18571 took a severe cold, which affected
my lungs. I had a terrible cough, and passed
night after night without sleep. The doctors
gave me up. I tried Ayer’s Cherry Pec-
toral, which relieved my lungs, induced
sleep, and afforded me the rest necessary
for the recovery of my strength. By the
continued use of the Pectoral a perma-
nent cure was effected. I am now 62 years
old, hale and hearty, and am satisfied your
Cherry Pectoral saved me.
Horace Fairbrother.”
Rockingham, Vt., July 15, 1882.
® Croup.—A Mother’s Tribute,
“■While in the country last winter my little
boy, three years old, was taken ill with croup;
it seemed as if he would die from strangu-
lation. One of the family suggested the use
of Ayer’s Cherry Pectoral, a bottle of
which was always kept in the house. This
was tried in small and frequent doses, and
lo our delight in less than half an hour tho
little patient was breathing easily. The doc-
tor said that the Cherry Pectoral had
saved my darling’s life. Can you wonder at
our gratitude ? Sincerely yours,
Mrs. Emma Gednev.”
159 West 128th St., New York, May 16, 1882.
“ I have used Ayer’s Cherry Pectoral
in my family for several years, and do not
hesitate to pronounce it the most effectual
remedy for coughs and colds we have ever
tried. A. J. Crane.”
Lake Crystal, Minn., March 13,1882.
“ I suffered for eight years from Bronchitis,
and after trying many remedies with no suc-
cess, I was cured by the use of Ayer’s Cher-
ry Pectoral. Joseph Walden.”
Byhalia, Miss., April 5,1862.
“I cannot say enough in praise of Ayer’s
Cherry Pectoral, believing as I do that
but for its use I should long since have died
from lung troubles. E. Braodon.”
Palestine, Texas, April 22, 1882.
No case of an affection of the throat or
lungs exists which cannot be greatly relieved
by the use of Ayer’s Cherry Pectoral,
and it will always cure when the disease is
not already beyond the control of medicine,

ROWLANDS ODONTO is the best, pur-
est, and most fragrant preparation for the teeth.
Health depends in a great measure upon the
soundness of the teeth and their freedom from
decay, and all dentists allow that neither washes
nor pastes can possibly be as efficacious for polish-
ing the teeth and keeping them sound and white
as a pure and non-gritty tooth powder; such Row-
lands’ Odonto has always proved itself to be.
ROWLANDS* EUKONIA is a beautifully
pure, delicate, and fragrant toilet powder, and has
latelv been much improved. Each box has inside
the lid a certificate of purity from Dr. Redwood,

Prepared from Dandelion, and free from the

are the popular medicine of the nineteenth cev-

A Hymn to Humbug.
VERSES UNTO VICE.
QUACKS AND THEIR VICTIMS.
Yet one more class, the Herbalists, assist
To swell the tale of those in Humbug; s list;
To these, join other quacks whose only plan
Of life is trading on the ills of man.
Their long advertisements display to view
Each dread disease humanity e’er knew;
And sentences ambiguously obscure
Hint at disease, and then announce a cure.
While dark suggestions, penned with wondrous
skill, , . ....
To make the reader think that he is 111,
Lead to the oifer to afford advice
And treat each case till cured at certainprlce.
But if some youth, in trustfulness, should send
The fees as named, reply will recommend
For his imagined ills some antidote
Which will be sent for (say) a ten-pound note.
This is no fable: we would gladly show
A letter written some few months ago
By one who advertising in thePresd
To cure all ills asserts his readiness.
And guarantees to set each patient free
From all diseases for a certaia fee.
Lured on by such good terms,'a settler sent
The cash as named and stated his complaint:
Yet no health-giving herbs repaid his trust—
But, in their place, to his Immense disgust,
A letter came, whose every lino might tell
That If the scribe did eure ’twas not by spell.
* Dear Sir,” ’twas thus it ran,— “Your case, I fear,
Is bad; you’ve gravel, dropsy, diarrhoea,
Kidney disorder, heartburn, nettle-rash,
With tendency to gout, and water-brash.
Our far-famed Nerve Pills, nerver known to fall,
Will o’er these ills most eertainly prevail,
And. with a tlncture.made by me, restore
Your shattered frame to health and strength once
more; _ ,..
Then take, with these, our famous Drops of Lifer—
And I may also add that, if a wife
Congenial to your taste can be procured,
Bir, by this means long life may be secured.
My medicines are costly—I desire
Only the cost price—for what you require
J only charge ten guineas: for that sum
I’ll drive all humours from your ‘little turn.’
(Here 1 would gladly use words more sublime.
But such, alas, won’t give the needed rhyme.)
* By this same post, I trust you will receive
Proofs of the cures my medicines achieve.
Of course the brocure shows but very few.
And paltry signs, of what my art can do:
But I can show such numerous proofs of skill
That, but to name them, ten such books would
fill.
* A well-known M.L.A., for lying famed,
So far from this disease I have reclaimed
That he has told bo lies for full six weeks,”—
The settler said, “Ah, then, he never speaks.” -
' A member, too, from pressure of the brain
Believed by me, is now himself again;
And yet another M L.A. I’ve fed
With healing balm for gravel in the head—
(To such a size this gravel, too, had grown,
His head was just as dense as paving-stouel)
And he from me such benefit received
That now, from all it held, his head’s relieved.
‘ One recent case, I openly confess.
At first defied the art which 1 profess:
It was a writer who was on the staff
Of what we call the threepenny Giraffe.
’Twas idlotcy that ailed him—week by week
He seemed to grow more fit for Tarban Creek;
Nor did my physic seem to operate,
Nor could I see the reason of his state,
Until, at last. I got him to admit
That he perused the lines his pen had writ.
I wondered not then at his mental pain—
Such stuff would overturn a healthy brain.
Now, he has promised be will never read
Either his own or fellow-writers’ screed;
And.’as there’s nothing else that can distort
His head, ’twill soon regain its want of thought.
" I’ve also cured a rising auctioneer
Of an attack of lying—but I fear
That this will knock his business into smash—
For, as he gains in truth, he loses cash.”
So on ad libitum. The settler, wise.
Saw cloven hoof peep through the thin disguise.
Was he, a married man, once more to mate ?
Nor law nor spouse this thing wouldjtolerate:
If he attempted such a game to try,
Full well he knew that someone’s locks would fly^
He laughed at his complaints, with such success
That they subsided into nothingness;
And as before his ills were born of gloom,
So now his merriment became their tomb.
But many a poor unfortunate has paid
Each fresh demand such daylight thieves have
made,
Until the treatment’s ultimate effect
Has been to ruin health and intellect.
Oh, that for one brief hour I might be free
To name the workers of such villainy I
Oh, that I might with glowing words transgress
The law that shields all scoundrels from the Press I
Then would I tell such ghastly truthful tales
That these men ne’er could stay in Now South
Wales.
And yet exposure could bo quickly made,
Should any wish their fellow-men to aid.
Let someone write, address as advertised.
Then have the boasted nostrums analysed:
Print all the letters, and contents ot stuff
Called medicine—that would be quite enough;
Print at full length the so-called Doctor’s name—
I’ll warrant he would ask for no more fame.
But now, perchance, someone may feel surprise
That I have never done what I advise.
Do I hold back for fear of being rash ?
Oh, no I I have the pluck, but not the cash.
ISHMAEL.
The Three Roses.
1 walked one day among the flowers
Growing in sweet, perfumed confusion,
Boses, and heliotrope, and myrrh,
While, ’neath the dense shade of a flr,
Grew primrose blossoms in profusion;
And much I communed, as alone
Among th« scented things I walked,
Until I stayed beside ne heads
Of three queens of the garden beds,
And thus to them I talked:
“ Say, glorious rose of scarlet tint.
And beauty which is leonine—
Say, bounteous rose of crimson hue,
If I your whim could grant to you,
What regal wish is thine ?”
“ Oh! ” quoth the rose with heightened tint,
« Mv wish is quickly full confest;
I would that—like the rose of old—
I might my warlike charms unfold
Upon Lancaster's breast.”
“ And you, of saffron-coloured leaf.
With tints whlcn faintly blush and flee,
If unto me was given the power
To grant your wish—O yellow flower,
What would your fancy be ? ”
“ Mine,” whispered she, with downcast head.
And leaves which trembled like a dove,
“ Is that a faithful hand shall break
My stalk, and, for my beauty’s sake,
Give mo one kiss of love,”
“ And yours, moss rose, whose tint is sure
Whiter than whitest, purest fleece ?
If I your wishes could command.
Speak, lovely queen of all the land,
Say—what is thy caprice ?”
“ I,” spake the virgin of the flowers,
• Wish tnat it ever should be said
That my poor shoots their blossoms bore
Over the gateway and the door
Where tears fall for the dead;
“ That on the breast and in the hands
Of those who Journey on to God
My blooms should lie, and fearless go
Within the coffin, hid below
The starred and verdant sod.”
“ Ah, roses red and cream,” cried I,
“ Hear thy pale sister's wlshed-for fate.
Thou, scarlet queen, would battle list;
Thou, saffron maid, wish thy leaves kissed;
She comforts e’en the desolate.
“ And nobler, purer, higher is
The wish the snowy flower has said
Than all your whims, for she would give
Away her glorious gift to live
And die among the dead.
“ Learn, 0 ye flowers 1 to bo like her—
To keep from thoughts of self apart;
Not the hot lover’s brave desire,
No! a Lancaster’s rose of fire,
Shows such a lion’s heart.”

Younfe Pipelegs was processing genteely
home along the Crescent the other evening, when
a clay-daubed Corporation man stopped him: “ I
say, boss, wud yez giv’ us a loight ? ” A look of
disapprobation came over the young gentleman’s
face, but, coldly saying, “I may have a match,’ he
searched, and found one. The municipal toller
crooked his knee, and slowly drawing the match
along his trousers, he Jit up, thus: “ 01 m thinking
(puff), Ol am. that (puff) ye musht be wan of (puff,
puff) thlm doodes.” And he slowly stumped away,
with a grin that made Pipelegs madly wish that he
only had a little more than the ordinary masher’s
amount of muscle.
We are going to prick the bladder; we are
about to tear aside the mask; we are on the eve of
throwing the electric light of common sense upon
a huge delusion; we are—but, hold hard. Let us
square our elbows and tackle the subject. In the
Atlantic Monthly, Mr. Richard t»rant White
has reviewed Shakespeare and his works in a style
that seems to us real wholesome. Everybody who
oasts up his optics to heaven when Shakespeare s
name is mentioned, is, of course, prepared to show
that the playwright was as good as great; that the
lofty thought he uttered, the noble moralities he
taught, were the reflex of his own nature. Well,
hear what Mr. White says:—“The interesting
question remains—Was this poet a good man ? We
don’t know. We only know that he was civil in
his demeanour; that his conduct united with his
great mental gifts, to win him, standing in the
lowest social position, the favour of those who
were in the highest; that Ben Jonson loved him,
and thought him honest and of a free and open
nature; that, being only an actor and a play-
wright, he rose rapidly from absolute poverty
to very considerable wealth ; that to please
the coarse tastes of a very considerable part
of the public, ho who, when he spoke, judi-
cially denounced indecency as bad in morals and
bad in art, made his plays more copiously, more
grossly, and more ingeniously indecent than any
others known to modern literature: that he sued
one of his Stratford townsmen for £116s. 10d., and
another for £6, and, getting judgment against the
latter, and not being able to arrest him, he pro-
ceeded against his surety; that he did not save his
father from similar prosecution on the part of hia
creditors, but that he did buy from the Herald’s
College a coat of arms for that father, and a patent
of gentry full of falsehood, of which he, at least,
was cognisant; and that when William Combe, the
squire of Welcombe, projected the enclosure of a
large part of the common fields at Stratford-on-
Avon, and there was great opposition in the inter-
ests of such men as Sha < espeare’s father and the
poor agricultural labourers, he, notwithstanding
entreaty, stood by the rich grasping squire. All
of which amounts to the statement that the God-
gifted William Shakespeare was, after all, of very
common clay; that the satirist of usury was a
miserable usurer himself; that the denouncer of
time-serving was a lickspittle of the most con-
temptible kind; that he who preached the nobility
of nature could lie to get a patent of gentility
provided him I And why not? There is nothing
in all this to raise the eyebrows about, ’Tis the
common spectacle -illustrated in the pulpit, on
the bench, at the bar, in “society”—oh, yes I tis
the very lever of society—in the Press, in every
institution of civilization. Virtue, honour, truth
are the worthy masks hy which clever men and
women tickle the imaginations of those who can
scarce idealise these principles, much less under-
stand their actuality. And so, who shall lexclalm
against Shakespeare because, being first of intel-
lects, he was none the less smaller or soul, mayhap,
than the hindsffie affected to despise. ’Tis human
nature, this, and it is well to remember that great
genius by no means absolves its owner from the
common frailties of human nature. So I
Mr. Minister Abbott deeply regrets that
Civil Servants have been mixed up with the
money-lending business, and the intelligence has—
as the immortal Dawvid would say—filled him with
“a soorprlze that borr-ur-ders upon con-stur-
nashin.” Just so. And when the spicy Davis v.
Fairfax revelations came to light, the heads, and
sub-heads, and sub-sub-heads of the different de-
partments threw up their hands with the same
holy horror, and exclaimed, “Can such things be
and overcome us like a cloud in these sweet abodes
of virtue and propriety ? Small wonder, either,
for it is always the foolish parents who think their
children perfect mode s, until they find them in
the gaol, or on the streets, and it is notorious that
it is always the injured husband who is the last in
the town to hear of his wife’s dishonour. The sim-
ple cause of the heads of our departments ignor-
ance respecting the rosy little games going on
amongst their subordinates, is that they take
matters far too easily, and, providing all things
seem to jog smoothly along, they seldom mix with
those below them, except, of course, at their an-
nual friendly picnics. Davis was no worse than
hundreds of others in the service, except in one
respect—he happened to be foolish enough to allow
himself to be bowled out. The convenient prac-
tice of the obliging usurer was started long before
Davis opened shop; it has flourished ever since,
and although the clouds lower o’er it now, it wilt
soon bob up as‘•erenely as ever. The Mines is
by no means the only department in the mire; m
point of fact, it is a trifle better than a few others,
which on pay-days were once so besieged by
battalions of the hook--.ose tribes that the places
looked more like Hebrew synagogues than re-
spectable Government offices. To say that these
disgraceful proceedings were sealed secrets to the
heads of some of these Departments is simply un-
true, because to such an extent did the nuisance
trow that it began to seriously affect the working
of the offices; and, as far back as 1879, an order was
issued by the Superintendent of at least one
branch of the service to his accountant to pay no
salaries to anyone except the clerks to whom they
were actually due. This caused trouble for a time
amongst the professional usurers outside: but it
would seem that an amiable little arrangement
was at last entered into between them and the
amateur sharks inside, by which the latter could
keep a close surveilance on the unfortunate
gentlemen who happened to be in a chronic state
bf impecuniosity. The greatness, so to speak, was
in a measure thrust upon the official usurer, and,
therefore, we are half inclined to drop a tear tor
the untimely fate of Mr. Davis, of whom it may be
said that he was simply a victim of accidental cir-
cumstances. The most serious feature about the
business, however, is the fact that such disreput-
able transactions as these can be carried on for
years with impunity under the very noses of tho
men paid by the State to check them, and it is
only when one delinquent, more avaricious or
more stu pid than the rest, unintentionally draws
aside the curtain that we get a glimpse of the rot-
tenness of the Service. How are we to know that
such things as unlawful perversion of Govern-
ment moneys, commission on contracts recom-
mended, and a hundred other similar scandalous
proceedings, infinitely worse than the Davis affair,
are not even now in full swing amongst us ? Our
Civil Service would seem to be a veritable Augean
stable, and the sooner a Hercules comes along
with a broom the better.
Advance Australia! Bingera leads the way.
Another long-felt want is filled chock-up to the
very bung-hole. For countless centuries back the
fair town of Bingera has yearned »ith a mighty
yearn for a fearless, outspoken journal, which
would do justice to the skill and industry of the
district hens by duly chronicling the arrival (f
their monster eggs, and which, in trumpet tone ,
would blazon forth to the world the mighty deedi
of Its amateur brass band, and the spirited enter,
prise of its local barber, who, at enormous ex-
pense and risk, introduced the first double-bar-
relied spittoon ever seen upon the Gwydir. But
Bingera yearns for these precious boons no more.
Mighty men have risen up in her midst; men who,
to the fertile imagination of a Shakespeare and
the classical erudition of a Person, unite a prac-
tical knowledge of the workings of the indis-
pensable paste-pot and shears, which is, to say the
least, phenomenal. Two of these intellectual giants
have coalesced, on the principle of two heads, &(.,
&c , and the result is the issue of a well printed (ani
better “leaded out ”) journal, called the Bingeua
Telegraph and Wartald a Gazette One Alfrv,
Wiskens (which is probably a neatly disguised form
of the word whisky) represents th» Bingera ele-
ment, and ample justice is done to the Warialda
division by a gentleman who boasts cf a name long
enough to knock down anples with—John Charles
Lawson Veness, no less. Quite a “new era in jour-
nalism” (rather a novel expression, that) has been
struck out by this noble pair of lUUrateurs, as may
be seen from a few hasty glances at a sketch
headed “To Top Bingera and Back.” This picnic
procession, we are told, was undertaken in order
that “ one of the party ’’—either Wiskens or Venes'
— might avail himstdf of the opportunity of
seeing with his own eyes, and feeling with hr
own spine, the numerous shafts sunk by tho
miners for the purpose of disclosing “ the
golden wealth which for many centuries had
been lying hidden in the bowels of the earth,
hundreds of feet below the surface of the
lofty mountains which rise, giant like, on
every side.” “Giant like” is good, and this is
probably the reason we get some more of it when
we are told that “ Our esteemed townsman” (more
originality), Mr, Walter Murray, landed the writer
— another flask of pain-killer- and three friend* at
the reefs “Just as old'Sol was shedding the last
of his golden evening rays on the tops of the giant
eucalypti and craggy rocks with which the long
chain of mountains are covered-at the door ot
Mr. B. Spicer’s Gold Diggers’ Arms Hotel ” Need
we add that the giant intellect of the B.T. and
W.G. at once let itself down a peg and
actually permitted host Spicer to show it into ‘ a
clean, snug little parlour, where, a few minutes
later, it operated like a hungry wolf upon a whole-
some evening meal.” The remainder of the even-
ing was one long feast of. reason and flow of soul
—together with a flow of something else out of a
stone jar—and next day the party descended some
of the “giant excavations made in solid stone by
hard-working miners while seeking the golden
treasures of the giant quartz reefs.” After this,
the giant genius said he’d have a little more
“killer” than “pain” in his tumbler this time
and then, tumbling ;into our giant townsman s
giant buggy once more, the excursionists were all
landed sately inside gunyahs, just as the sonorous
hoofs of Aurora’s bounding steeds struck the
russet-hued gibbers of the eastern sky, without
one of the company being mistaken for either a
roost robber out on the war-path, or a Sydney
Buffalo delegate coming home with customary
honours from the opening of a new lodge. Such is
the Bingera Telegraph and Warialda Ga-
zette, a journal for which we can sately predict
the time-honoured “brilliant career”—if it’s not
