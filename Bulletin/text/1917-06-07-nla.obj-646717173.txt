AFRAID OF FOOD.
Sufferers from Indigestion very often become faddists as regards their food, and find
themselves in _ time reduced to a very meagre and unsatisfying diet. Hudson’s
Eumenthol Jujubes correct acidity of the stomach, and their antiseptic properties
prevent abnormal fermentation of the
food, thus allowing the natural digestive
ferments to act, and if taken regularly
after meals they so, improve the digestion
that a strict diet becomes unnecessary.
Hudson’s Eumenthol Jujubes are most
useful to those who suffer from Heart-'
burn, Flatulence and Dyspepsia.

The Red Page
Leon Gellert! A new name to this page, a
new name in Australian literature. For
Songs of a Campaign, by Leon Gellert
(printed and published by Hassell, of Adel-
aide, in a manner worthy of its contents), is
a definite achievement in Australian poetry.
The publisher notes that this book was
awarded the Bundey Prize for English Verse
at the Adelaide University this year. This
page’s congratulations to the Adelaide Uni-
versity for possessing a prize for Australian
poetry, and for having thus awarded it.
The book is made up of poetry composed
by the writer on active service in Egypt,
Gallipoli and (presumably wounded) in Eng-
land. Leon Gellert —-if that should be his
real name—is thus a product of the war.
The quality of these brief compositions is
equal and high. The selection of so many
poems for quotation is the result of an
embarrassment of poesy; but we are not
wantonly rifling Leon Gellert’s best to make
a Red Page holiday: there are many more
poems in these Songs of a Campaign just as
good. The three prefatory sonnets are
sonnets, though of an Adelaidean irregu-
larity, with a feminine felicity of melody:—
The. birds are in the morn, the bees in noon.
The eve has song and sleep' and sloiv
repose. ...
But that is all. “The Edge of the Desert”
is a mere nostalgia stranded in Egypt; but
in “'Songs of the Expedition, 1915,” a new
masculine note sounds: the poet reacts
almost violently to the reality of war. Pic-
tures are etched into his.brain and remorse-
lessly printed in. sometimes strident lines;
shadows fall upon him and he reflects them
with a new sincerity and a perfect economy
of words. He sees red; he sees death; he
imagines what it is to be dead; he “watches
the shrapnel break on the smashed land” and
dreams of home; he learns the meaning of
manhood: These men know life — know death
a little more ; and he is loth to leave Anzac
with her “long-forgotten dead with sunken
graves.” And yet he can write of Anzac
Cove in his earlier, unawakened way, in the
incongrous jogging moke-meter of our bush
bards—the one flaw in the collection.
But in “Songs of tjie Sick” he returns to
reality, rivalling anything that Henley in
his hospital ever did. He paints for us, with
virile strokes and few, the consumptive, the
epileptic, the cripple, the blind, with a mov-
ing but masculine sympathy; and in the
poem “Patience,” quoted earlier, he suggests
a haunting picture of a wounded mind hover-
ing on the edge of insanity. But in “After-
wards” the mood has evaporated: he slips
back into his earlier manner, playing care-
lessly with abstractions of Love and Death,
far banished from reality. The war has
made him; the war has broken him. Yet
what the war made of him is sufficient for
us: this book is the best collection of poetry
that has come out of the war to Australia—
one of the best that has come ’jut of the war
to the English language.
War Poems by Leon Gellert
THE DIGGERS.
The diggers are digging, and digging deep.
They’re digging and singing,
And I’m asleep.
They're digging and singing and swiftly
they’re swinging
The flying earth as it falls in a heap.
And some of it scatters and falls on my
head,
But the diggers dig on. They can only dig.
They can only sing, and their eyes are big.
Their eyes are big and heavy as lead.
They dig and they sing, and they think I’m
dead.
The diggers are digging, and filling the hole.
They’re sighing and sighing.
They pray for my soul,
I hear ivhat they say, and from where I am
lying
I hear a new corporal calling the roll.
But the diggers dig on and fill in my bed.
The diggers dig on, and they sweat and they
sic eat.
They sigh and they sigh, and their eyes are
wet.
The brown earth clatters and covers my
head,
Then I laugh and I laugh, for they think I’m
dead.
THE HOSPITAL FOR THE BLIND.
A red-roofed house is shining to the skies,
A house red-roofed and brilliant in the
wind,
A house of color filled with wandering eyes,
And all the eyes are blind.
A gentle sound of moving fills each room;
A sound of hands—dumb hands that touch
and pry; ,
A sound of fingers feeling in a tomb
Before they close and die.
A hundred windoics face long rows of
flowers —■
Long rows of flowers, and flowers that
sway and dance;
Dance where lidded eyes can gaze for hours
and hours;
Blue eyes that shut in France.
BEFORE ACTION.
We always had to do our work at night.
I wondered why we had to be so sly.
I wondered why we couldn’t have our fight
Under the open sky.
I tvondered why I always felt so cold.
I wondered why the orders seemed so slotv,
So slow to come, so whisperingly told,
So whisperingly low.
I wondered if my packing-straps were tight,
And wondered why I wondered .... Sound
went wi1d. ...,
An order came... .1 ran into the night,
Wondering why I smiled.
A NIGHT ATTACK!.
Be still. The bleeding night is in suspense
Of watchful agony and colored thought,
And every beating vein and trembling sense,
Long-tired with time, is pitched and over-
wrought.
And for the eye, the darkness holds strange
forms,
Soft movements in the leaves, and wicked
glows;
Strange shapes of vvhite and grey that no
one knows;
And for the ear; a sound, a pause, a
breath,
A distant hurried footstep moving fast.
The hand has touched the slimy face of
death.
The mind is raking at the ragged past.
....A sound of rifles rattles from the south,
And startled orders move from mouth to
mouth.
PATIENCE.
Red! red! red!
Is there no black?
Red like the bloody earth, this pack!
Knaves! Kings! Queens! —all red!
Where are the black?
Shuffle again!
Will not the other cards come back f
The only cards to clear the brain!
Dear God, 'twill crack!
Shuffle again!
Red! red! red!
Black! black! black!
Is there no red?
Has all the blood on earth been shed?
Each Queen! Each King! And every Jack!
Where are the red?
Shuffle again!
Has blood within the world all bled?
The millions mourning for the slain?
The million dead?
Shuffle again!
Black! black! black!
From “Songs of a Campaign” (Hassell,
Adelaide).
Women and the Poor Dears
The eternally perturbing question whether
women have any intelligence, and if so, why?
is intelligently discussed by W. L. George
in a book provocatively entitled The Intelli-
gence of Woman (Jenkins, per Sydney Book
Club). W. L. George knows something about
woman; besides his novels, A Bed of Roses,
The Making of an Englishman, The Second
Blooming, The Strangers' Wedding, which
deal chiefly with that sub-section of man-
kind, he has already told us all about
Woman and To-morrow. This second bloom-
ing might just as well be entitled Woman
and the Day After To-morroiv.
“The war may alter the map of Europe,”
he says, “Feminism will alter the map of
mankind.” In these times, he notes, women
seem the only permanent things. “It seems
that the intelligence of man cannot solve the
problem of woman, which is a bad sign in a
superior intelligence. The trouble lies in
this: man assumes too readily that woman
essentially differs from man.... Almost
every man believes in the mystery of woman.
Ido not. For men are also mysterious to
women; women are quite as puzzled by our
stupidity as by our subtlety.” W. L. George
bases his conclusions upon research; he
quotes cases, records his observations of a
number of typical specimens, but admits the
difficulty of securing true evidence—from
women. A woman can sincerely answer the
same question in four ways; Truthfully, with
a defensive touch, if she is alone with
another woman; with intent to cause male
rivalry if she is with two men; with false
modesty and seductive evasiveness if she is
with one man and one woman; with a clear
intention to repel or attract if she is with a
man alone. You see the difficulty? “Owing
to the system under which we live, where
man is a valuable prey, woman has con-
tracted the habit of trying to attract.”
Of woman’s opposition to war, usually put
down to her humanitarian attitude, the
author furnishes another explanation. He
thinks it due chiefly to her sexual conscious-
ness. Let us make the test that he makes:
read these two paragraphs:—
Before the trenches lay heaped hundreds of young
men, with torn bodies, their faces pale in the moon-
light. The rays lit up the face of one that, lay near,
made a glitter upon his little golden moustache.
Before the trenches lay heaped hundreds of young
girls. The moonlight streamed upon their torn
bodies and- their fair skins. The rays fell upon one
that lay near, drawing a. glow from the masses of her
golden hair.
The effect of those paragraphs will vary
according to the sex of the reader. To the
male the second is almost unbearable; to
the female the first is the more horrible. So
if women went to war instead of men their
attitude to war might'be different.
W. L. George inclines to believe that
woman is firstly animal,. secondly intellec-
tual ; while man appears to be occasionally
animal and primarily intellectual. Women
“lie and curvet” as a policy because they
think that thus they best can, manage men.
“They generally believe that they can man-
age men. They look on them as ‘poor dears.’
They honestly believe that the ‘poor dears’
cannot cook, or run houses, or trim hats,
ignoring the fact that the ‘poor dears' do
these things better than anybody, in kit-
chens, in hotels and in liat shops. Especially
they believe that they can outwit them in
the game of 10ve... .Centuries of thraldom
and centuries of flattery have caused her to
believe this —the poor dear !”
. But W. L. George, being himself a Femi-
nist, does not lose hope. Once the proposal
was: “Will you be mine?” But there are
faint signs that men will yet say: “May I
be yours?” But the reader must not think
a Feminist is a mere Female, or even a mere
suffragist. In an interesting chapter the
author indicates the scope and ultimate
ideals of this remarkable movement.
W. L. George suggests .uniforms for women
in a chapter that will appeal to every hus-
band. He notes the remarkable attitude of
women to clothes: the fashions change with
;such a dizzy rapidity that women have not
time to wear their clothes out. “To-day
women will quite openly say, ‘I won’t buy
that. I couldn’t wear it out.’ They actually
■want to wear out their clothes!” ■ Women
are to-day in the grasp of a new hysteria;
lacking their own old occupations of brewing,
baking, child-rearing, etc., they are des-
perately looking for something to do. And
W. L. George believes that fashions will
becbrne more extreme to-morrow. The prices
foi* women’s clothes compared with those
for men’s are outageous, e.g., the evening
gown for £2O, the man’s lounge suit for £7
(London prices). A “good cut” doesn’t
account for the discrepancy, as a man pays
only moderately for the art of a good tailor.
The author calculates that women spend
quite 10 per cent, of the household income
on clothes.
Clothes and the'wmman! They re-act on
each other. “Woman does not desire to be
beautifully dressed; she desires to be more
beautifully dressed than the other woman.
She wishes to insult and humiliate her sis-
ters, and she does not hesitate to give full
play to human cruelty, to use all the re-
sources of the rich husband on whom she
preys to satisfy her pride and to apply hex-
arrogant ingenuity to the torture of her
sisters.” Women do not want to attract
men. “They think they do, but they do not,
for they know perfectly well that few men
realise what they wear, that all they observe
is ‘something blue’ or an effect they call
‘very doggy’; they also know that men do
not wed the dangerous smart, but the
modest; that men fear the implication that
smart women are unvirtuous, and that they
certainly fear their dressmakers’ bills.”
Hence the necessity for patting the danger-
ous animals into uniform. Of course they
already wear uniform; as many of them as
can procure a musquash coat wear that
uniform now; but when that uniform be-
comes common, in fact, when it becomes uni-
form, women will discard that uniform for
anothei-. All that George implies is that
the uniform of fashion should not change.
“The way in which old and young, tall and
short, fat anc| thin, force themselves into
the same color and the same shape is sheer
socialism.; I merely want to carry the uni-
form idea a little further, to make it a
permanent uniform.” And the poor dear
actually suggests that uniform, costing annu-
ally £3O. For instance, here is “a fixed
type- of evening-gown, price £5 to £8”:
“Without any lace or trimmings, sequins,
paillettes; without overlays of flimsies of
any kind ; no voile, no pongee silk, no chif-
fon, no charmeuse or tulle, no crgpe de chine,
no muslin, but a stuff of good quality, hang-
ing in straight folds. Jewellery to be
banned.” Now, how is Woman to be per-
suaded to get about in that? Merely let
society leaders decree that any variation
from the new standard is lad form. There
is a flaw, however, in the author’s sugges-
tion: How is he going to persuade his
society leaders to hang in straight folds?
But what about a woman’s individuality?
Men wear uniform and still possess theil-
individuality. To-day women’s individual
clmjrms are smothered by the paraphernalia
nf fashion.
Woman is tired or being immolated on the
domestic hearth; already she is celebrating
the downfall of that Bastille, the English
home. “It has taken woman’s time; it has
taken much of her energy, much of her
health and good looks.” And the' husband
regards the occupations of the household as
undignified; -no husband would ever admit
that he washed —or attempted to wash —the
front steps, or the baby. The domestic man,
the kind that can hang a picture straight, is
regarded by male acquaintances with sorrow-
ful tolerance. And from the ruins of the
home W. George builds for the future
enormous blocks of flats, with no more
heated interviews with cooks, but a chat with
a manager who has the manners and the tact
of an ambassador. No more home work ! No
more of that propinquity “that brings one to
think there is something rather repulsive in
blood relations.” The tragedy of the family
is that it lives on top of itself; there are too
many compulsory rejoicings at Christmas or
on birthdays. That other Bastille, the
family, must go, too. So we come to
marriage.
W. L. George estimates, after investigat-
ing a number of cases, that only 6 per cent,
of marriages are successful. One trouble is
that the wife lias only got her husband ; the
husband has got his business plus his wife.
The investigator tabulates 10 causes for the
disintegration of marriage. Two of them
are: “Being too much together,” and “Being
too much apart.” One woman puts her case
thus: “I wonder whether we only fall in love
with men just about the time that they get
sick of us.” And in marriage the little
things bulk. Here are two cases:—
I really was very much in love with him, and
only just at the end of the engagement did I notice
how hard be blew his nose. After we were married I
thought: “Oh! don’t be so silly and notice such little
things, he’s such a splendid fellbw.” A littlepater:
“Oh ! Ido wish .he wouldn’t blow his nose like that;
it drives me mad.” Now I find myself listening and
telling myself with an awful feeling of doom: “He’s
going to blow his nose.”
The wife is afflicted with the cliche habit, and can
generally sum-up a situation by phrases such as:
“All is not gold that glitters.” Or, “Such is life.”
Or, “Well, well, it's a weary world.” The husband
can hear them coming.
Man seldom asks much: if only a wife will
not compromise his reputation for attractive-
ness while maintaining her own by flirtation,
if she will accept his political views, acquire
a taste for his favorite holiday resorts, and
generally say: “Yes, darling,” or “No, dar-
ling,” opportunely, she need do nothing. She
has only “beautifully to be.” But woman
asks not only that he should love her, but
that he must still be her lover. W. L.
George imagines that the happiest couple in
the world is the one where each lives in
perpetual fear that somebody will run away
with the other.
His conclusion ,'is that marriage is a
puzzle almost, but not quite, insoluble. And
yet it stands, only because there is nothing
much to put in its place, “because marriage
is the only road that leads a man away from
his dinner when he is 45, or teaches a woman
to preserve her complexion.” Some day* he
hopes, marriage will turn into a skilled occu-
pation. If women demand a recognition of
their worth long enough they will get it.
Marriage can grow close only if divorce is
easy, if female labor extends. W. L. George
even gives six commandments for the
married. Here are the three most important:
“Vary your pursuits, your conversation and
your clothes.” (But what about uniforms
for women?) If required, vary your
hair. Once a day say to a wife: “I
love you”; to a husband, “How strong you
are !” If the latter remark is ridiculous, say :
“How clever you are !” for everybody believes
that. Forgive your partner seventy times
seven. Then burn the ledger.
And every wife who reads this book will be
perfectly convinced in her own mind that the
author of it must have made an awful mess
of his own marriage—poor dear!
According to an angry member of the
Murchison Free Library (Tic.), who snorts
in Rushworth Chronicle, the majority of
the committee decided that “the general
tone and language of Dennis’s Sentimental
Bloke and Ginger Mick were not such as
would warrant them being placed in a re-
spectable library.” But did that annoyed
library member rush straight out and buy
the forbidden fruit? No, he “borrowed the
bdoks from a friend.” It seems that the
only person who deserves sympathy is
Dennis.

The brusque questionings of the post-master
Checking an involuntary sigh;
Tired eyes facing a void,
Striving a worldly braveness;
Hands reddened, by toil,
Fumbling with gaudy-colored pension-books,
Striking a garish note;
The telegraph tapping requiem;
A date stamp hammering a deeper pain of

A wearied man frowhed from the task in

At the persistent rapping of a chinless youth,
Wanting a penny stamp.

RHEUMATISM
Its Cause—and Cure.
Rheumatism is caused by a curious,
poisonous acid in the blood. This acid, just
like tiny pieces of broken glass with rough
edges, settles in the joints and muscles and
causes that awful agonising pain of back-
ache, rheumatism and gout, gravel, and the
burning sensation of inflammation of the
bladder, etc.
De Witt’s Kidney and Bladder Pills
strengthen the kidneys and drive the
poisonous pain-causing acid right out of the
system.
To cure rheumatism or any other form of
kidney trouble you must positively get rid
"f the cause —the poisonous uric acid.
Kemember to do this a real remedy must
pass through the kidneys and the bladder
and not through the bowels, as most kidney
pills do. When you see the urine change to
a muddy bluish color—a feature which dis-
tinguishes De Witt’s Kidney and Bladder
Bills from all others—you know beyond all
doubt that they have put their healing
touch on the right spot—the kidneys and
the bladder. A wonderful pill—straight to
the kidneys—that is why De Witt’s pills
give such amazingly quick relief —every
time. A permanent cure follows in almost
every case. Look for that blue-colored urine.
Don’t waste a single hour. Go to your
chemist at once and ask him for a 2s. 9d.
box of De Witt’s Kidney and Bladder Pills,
which are made expressly for kidney and
bladder troubles.
They will cure every one* of the above
symptoms, no matter how long or how badly
you have suffered.

How I Darkened My
Grey Hair.
Lady Gives Simple Home Recipe That
She Used to Darken Her Grey Hair.
For years I tried to restore toy grey hair
to its natural color with the prepared dyes
and stains, but none of them gave satisfac-
tion and they were all expensive. I finally
came across a simple recipe which I mixed
at home that gives wonderful results. 1
gave the recipe, which is as follows, to .a
number of my friends, and they'are all
delighted with it. To Toz. of water add a
small hox of Orlex Compound and Toz. of
bay rum. These ingredients can be bought
at any chemist’s at very little cost. Use
every other day until the hair becomes the
required shade. It will not only darken
the grey hair but removes dandruff and acts
as a tonic to the hair. It is not stickv yr
greasy, and will not rub off or stain' the
scalp.— Advt. [5

Troglodyte.
Hence! »I have done with dalliance.
I want no caechinating air
To irritate me in my lair.
No jocund fools to mouth and prance
In noisy bacchanalian dance !
The world’s an empty shell: a box
Of insects purposeless and vain.
Each scurrying in its stupid plane ;
A mob of apes that jeers and mocks ;
A tadp’ole pond ; a paradox.
Give me no mawkish sounds of flutes;
Or ballads of those sottish deeds.
Of how rank weeds made war on weeds;
Or sickly whines of lovers' lutes —
Rather the honest lusts of brutes !
The stifling sweets of women cloy ;
They are not worth the strife and coil.
These are but poor adventure’s spoil—-
Pretence, and mimicry of joy—
They were mere goats who fought at Troy !
Take it in whole, the market-place
Is vilest, with its chaffering crew ;
I shun the pot where treasons stew.
And knaves and prelates mouth for grace
To sluttish thieves and villains base.
There foxy-face and cunning-pate
Spin out nefarious webs by day.
And whine, and cheat, and lie. and pray ;
Or oafs chase fashions next in date,
Or loud to fellow-numbskulls prate.
I need them not, nor any kin
Of festering products of the street;
Or vultures overgorged with meat
Though fatness bulge their pampered skin —
I loathe rich muds they wallow in!
Apart I hide, nor heed their spells,
Nor anything they have or prize;
My hermit cave remoter lies
From noisome human herds, than dwells
High heaven from the deepest hells!

The Poet’s Garden.
When in the long lagoons of slumber sink
The tired flocks of men surrounding me,
On naked feet I walk the lilac brink
Of my own Memory.
And in an alley of the hanging air
Dim blossoms of a garden softly swing
Love lyrics, happy od'es, and sonnets fair
Through my Imaginings.
I lean my cheek upon the garden rail
Tasting the fragrance of that company,
Who through the ferny aisles and angles
trail
White Immortality.
Odorous daisies from far milky meads
Waft o’er my wall the innocence of Truth,
And from a pool asway with rhyming reeds
I breathe eternal l'puth.
Oh haply, in some velvet noon of night,
A glimmering hand, flower-full, will soft
unclose,
And slipping through the silence, filmy-light,
Drop on my heart a rose.

Through foreign lands I went
Amidst entrancing strangers;
Yet held beside my heart
A charm against their dangers.!
* j ■
The bright soft golden curl
She gave me when we parted, ,
In token of her love,
Rendered me stony-hearted.
And, still, when I returned,
That simple charm I treasured;
The worth of it to me
Could in no wise be measured.
I sought my lady out.
Wild words of love to utter;
She gave me—no! not love,
But tea and bread and butter.
Though queenly cold she seemed.
My fond heart could not doubt her ;
And yet my puzzled eyes
Found something strange about her.
I drew my sweet aside;
And hotly, madly, told her
How easily my heart
With golden strands could hold her.
“For years upon my breast,”
I said, “your gift I’ve carried;
And it shall stay with me
Till I am dead —or married !”
IIei; cold eyes questioned mine,
So, groping in my pocket.
Out from its resting place
I brought the curl and locket.
It lay upon my palm
In all its golden splendor.
“The curl from your dear hair!”
I breathed in accents tender.
And no triumphant knight
Who, in his deeds well-guided,
Returned his lady’s glove
Could e’er have felt as I did!
And yet —why should she frown?
I gazed at her in wonder:
Her locks (also her brow)
Were now as black as thunder!

THE TARIFF AND THE ADVOCATES
OF SNOOZE.
Thebe was a conference of Australian
manufacturers in Sydney last week, and the
tale they had to tell was, mainly, that unless
the Australian tariff was made Protective
in a real sense it would be hopeless to look
for an expansion of industry or, after the
war, for the maintenance of its present
state of health. Whereupon the organs of
Freetrade lifted up their pens in anguish
and moaned about the iniquity of making
provision for after-the-war days before the
war is over. In many maundering words
they explained that shortage of shipping was
already giving manufacturers a very large
measure of Protection and that it was
wicked to knock off winning the war and
start meddling with something that could be
attended to the day after to-morrow. This,
of course, is what might have been expected
from expounders of the gospel according to
the Fusion. The doctrine of the Fusion is
that, for some occult reason, the tariff must
be left alone. Between mysteriously assert-
ing that for indefinite reasons nothing can
be done at present, and proclaiming that for
specific reasons nothing should be done any-
how, there is a close community of ideas,
all of which arrive at the same place —the
dead-end, beloved of stick-in-the-muds and
members of the Sit Tight party all Over the
world. The reply to these people who
habitually yearn to do nothing is in this
case twofold. First, it is clear that specific
arguments directed to show why the tariff
should be amended are not met by bald
assertions that it cannot be done on
account of circumstances which are kept
dark. Further, it is morally certain that
shortage-of-shipping Protection is only tem-
porary, and that when the torpedo finishes
it will evaporate. Viewed from any
standpoint except that of the professional
tariff-sinker, the state of mind of the indi-
viduals who stall their subject in this way
is hopeless. Either Australian industry
should be protected by weapons in the hands
of the Commonwealth or it should depend
for protection on destructive agencies con-
trolled by enemies. Tf the latter is the case,
the shortage of shipping should be accepted
with thanks. If it is not. the failure of
Parliament to escape from dependence on the
submarine calls for immediate attention.
This paper believes that Australia has
depended quite long enough on foreign sup-
plies and that the Fusion acceptance of the
U-boat as a tariff regulator is both indecent
and futile.
The tariff cannot be left huddled away
out of sight under the pretence that to dis-
turb it would interfere with Hughes's plans
for conquering Yon Hindenburg. Cer-
tainly it cannot be neglected because some-
one or other thinks the subject may be taken
up later on. The time for grappling with
it is now. Every consideration for the
economic future of Australia, every plan for
keeping abreast of the national obligations
and for moving towards a solvent nation-
hood. hinges on the question of production
within the Commonwealth. The tariff is
the king-pin of the situation; and because
the thing we have is not an instrument of
Protection, a flood of foreign imports has
been pouring into the country, plunging the
people deeper and deeper into a quagmire
of debt. To leave it alone is to shirk it,
add to our difficulties and reduce the coun-
try’s powers to weather the storm that is
already breaking. All the conventional
blither about Germans and yanking up upas
trees and “utilising our resources” is of
no more assistance than a succession of the
old yells about sending no more orders to
Hamburg. The essential meaning of the
demand for an amended tariff is that Aus-
tralia shall begin at once to work. What
is the objection to that? If except by work
there is any way open to this country of,
on the one hand, escaping economic ruin and,
on the other, placing upon a solid founda-
tion the social conditions created by waste
of the national assets, this paper has not
yet heard of it. Anyway, if there is such
an alternative method it should be produced
for public inspection. The sands are run-
ning out. A gigantic debt has been brought
into existence. Even the most ignorant
citizen has, through the war and the rise in
prices and the breakdown of the p.n., dis-
covered that industrially Australia has been
groping about in the Dark Ages. What is
the good of telling him that he can see about
it all next year or the year after, when he
is face to face with the almost tragic conse-
quences of having listened to the same sort of
poisonous talk last year and the year before?
Every five minutes or so loud remarks can
be heard about the “fool’s paradise” the
community has been inhabiting. Very well.
If the meaning of this is not that Australia
was comfortably snoozing while the nation’s
industries were carried on across the sea.
then the idiotic locality is misunderstood.
Yet when a preliminary step towards escape
is suggested by manufacturers they are
informed by inspired patriots to go on
•snoozing and win the war!
This is no time for Snooze. If it had
not been for somnolence in days gone by
Australia would be producing if not all the
country’s requirements certainly a very sub-
stantial portion thereof, instead of buying
them on the deferred-payment plan else-
where. If snooze prevails now the inevitable
result will be an Australia waking up with
a jerk to conditions for which no preparation
has been made. Industries do not grow up
in a day like a new political, party, nor do
they flourish on wind. Neither technical
skill nor mechanical equipment are acquired
in a night. Factories that are kept going
because war loans are being tossed round
and ships are being sunk will not be going
very long after the loan is a memory and
the new season’s goods begin to reach the
indent department. The need of turning to
the constructive business of living by work
instead of by borrowing presses heavily.
Whatever the result of the war may be.
nothing can be more certain than that those
vicious old days of, shambling along from
year to year in pursuit of dollars earned by
promising to pay them back have gone for
ever—that these wretched doles handed out
by treacherous politicians to a careless
people will purchase no more rest from the
stern job every nation on earth has had
before it and which is now in front of Aus-
tralia. practically untouched. No one out-
side a lunatic asylum imagines that a tariff
excluding everything wanted by man is
reouired. What is wanted is a tariff behind
which industries employing Australian work-
men and Australian materials may cater for
the market at their hand, and around which
other industries may spring into existence—
a tariff that will save Australia from
the drainage of her wealth and the wastage
of material and opportunity; that will open
the way for the employment of the people’s
skill and enterprise. Unless Australia has
this how can she hope to prosper or even to
dodge disaster? The Bulletin does not
know. It does not believe anybody knows
or that in the length and breadth of the land
it would be possible to discover an individual
who does not realise the iniquity of the past
and current policy of using public money
for the encouragement of an all-round
national loaf.
LABOR IN FIJI.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Within easy reach of the Australian Com-
monwealth. where men who work for others
have succeeded in obtaining reasonable con-
ditions, a system exists which, veiled though
it be under the name indenture, and regu-
lated as to pay. is as repugnant as any
slavery.
Easily its most degrading feature is the
practice of setting the female to labor in the
fields side by side with men. and doing men’s
work. Let the women of Australia imagine
other women, coppery in color, young many
of them, handsome a few of them, arriving at
Fiji in the coolie immigrant ship, allocated
to various plantations, huddled up on ship-
board with coolie men. On the plantations
the women are again thrown in with other
Indian men whom they have never before
seen. If they do not pick their own hus-
bands. temporary or otherwise, the person
in charge of the plantation to which they are
allocated will as likely as not allot them to
men on the plantation as his fancy directs
him.
At five in the morning, before day has
begun to break, the turn-to gong sounds.
Then these women trail out in dew or in
rain, cane-knives in hand, to labor in the
fields. Thigh-deep (for they are small of
stature) in moisture-dripping vegetation and
adhesive black mud, they cut and slash out
weeds and Mauritius bean and stack and
pack it. They are bedraggled and foul with
sticky mud aud decaying vegetable matter.
Many are racked with coughs. Other women
carry bundles of seed-cane on their heads
for sometimes little short of a mile, over
slippery roads, often up and down steep
hills, placing the cane in drills, cutting it
into lengths with the cane-knives. Here is
not the Man with the Hoe, but the \V uman,
spurred on by a native sardar, who sees to
it that no leaning is done.
Unmistakably weary and sick, most morn-
ings some women line up before the
sahib craving permission to go to hospi-
tal for treatment of coughs or other ail-
ments. Not infrequently they are upbraided
for shamming; other times they are given
permission to walk to the district hospital—
two miles or more, it may easily be —and
the same distance back after treatment.
Sometimes they are unable to finish the
daily task set them, for the performance of
which they are paid the sum of ninepence
per diem, without food. If unable to com-
plete the task they are paid for the part they
have finished. Not one penny is abated.
The sahibs’ word is their bond. But how
wretchedly little it is! I have seen women
work all day, hoeing out weeds, in such rain
that 2.75 in. fell. Unable naturally to finish
the task set them, they have received but
fourpence for that day’s man-killing work.
Out of that they had to buy their food. They
have quarters—the coolie lines: comfortless
places at best and on some plantations in
such a state of wreck and litter that many
Australian men would have compunction
about stabling an animal they valued therein.
And some of these women have babies, or
get them after a while. These mites are
left in the plantation crfeche in the care of
an Indan ayah (at ninepence a day), while
the mothers toil in the fields. Some er&ches
I have seen would make the heart of any
Australian mother ache. Picture a dark,
wooden house without windows, a concrete
floor. Next, a couple of undressed scant-
lings nailed across the house. From the
scantlings are slung rude cots of sticks and
old bags. There the brown babies sprawl.
The flies in the crfeche and the lack of atten-
tion to the infants make one shudder.
There is but one thing to be said for the
system: these are the laboring women of
India, and if conditions existing in Fiji are
bad, the pay, at any rate, was lower in their
native land. But that argument cannot
alter the fact that at the front gate of Aus-
tralia, proud leader and champion of liberty
and of fair dealing to men, and especially
women, labor and other conditions utterly
foreign to the Commonwealth’s ideals exist
—conditions which Australia and Maoriland
could abolish if they chose. For the two
C.S.R. Companies, which virtually rule Fiji,
though they do not themselves work' any
plantations worth mentioning, are almost
wholly Australasian.
It is not that the employer companies do
not deal in strict justice with the labor in
accordance with the term of indenture. The
C.S.R. Co. in particular acts fairly, and
earnestly impresses upon its servants the
absolute necessity for the strictest justice in
their dealings with indentured labor. It
is not the way the bond is interpreted that
is at fault. It is the bond itself.
The term of indenture is five years—a
limited sort of serfdom ; the daily rate of pay
Is. for a male and ninepence for a female,
with trifling bonuses for certain kinds of
work done. The daily toil is not to exceed
nine hours for five days, with a half-day on
Saturday —-or an equivalent task. To get
every ounce out of the laborers the task
system is in general use. The task may be
depended upon to be as much as an average
coolie can do. This system ensures a maxi-
; mum of work while the onus of performance
is thrown on the worker. Sardars, Indian
overseers, are employed to carry out the
work. The pay for a head-sardar on a plan-
tation under one thousand acres is 14s. per
week, and for an under-sardar 10s. How
akin to slavery the system really is one could
see from the advertisements that used to
appear in local papers. Indian were
there boldly advertised for sale. The com-
panies were shocked at such unguarded lan-
guage, and pointed out to their servants that
it was really only the indentures, and not the
people, that were being sold, and that such
expressions should be carefully guarded
against. It was a distinction without much
difference. Indeed, there is the term “Free
Indians” employed on the plantation books
in distinction to the coolie. This in itself
says all that need be said on the subject.
Considerable hostility has arisen to the
system. The quasi-independent planters,
with their company’s benevolent backing, as
well as the company on its own behalf, are
strenuously battling for its maintenance.
But the Fiji Government itself is apparently
beginning to have qualms. Indians offending
against labor regulations are now leniently
dealt with, to the bitter indignation of the
old Fijian white, who refuses to see need for
justice for anyone but himself. That is
really why Fiji employers of labor fear
Australian annexation, of which there is
much talk in Fiji. They know that even the
distant prospect of a change would probably
lead to trouble. Already, indeed, the Indian
is becoming more independent and more re-
bellious. Brutality by an overseer, himself
pushed by unreasonable employers, is met
with retaliation. Gangs of coolies occasion-
ally beat such a one to death with their
hoes or hack him to pieces with cane-cutting
knives. Over-driven coolie women some-
times capture the overseer sahib, throw him
down and inflict upon him unnameable in-
dignities. The coolie has his eyes stead-
fastly upon the end of his indenture and
counts every day which brings his freedom
nearer, praying for the time when he will be
in a position to bid for his own little cane-
patch or start trading in a small way.
And not in Fiji alone has the system its
enemies. They are indeed more powerful in
India —so powerful that only one immigrant
ship is to arrive this year, and its all-
insufficient contents will be allocated pro
rata to the different estates. Some of the
smaller ones expect to be hard put to it for
labor, and one, at least —the Penang Sugar
Estate —is at present endeavoring to aug-
ment its indentured labor by recruiting un-
satisfactory Fijian labor on Kadavu Island.
The question for Australia to answer is
whether it should stand by taking no part in
the controversy. Or, rather, whether its
part in the matter should only be a struggle
to continue the present system. For through
the C.R.S. Co. it is at this moment repre-
sented by special emissaries in London who
are urging that the old system should not be
altered. The Government must decide
whether Australian influence in London on
this matter should go at that.
ERNEST OSRORNE.
MICE.
Somewhere at the back of the force of
gravity and the Weather Bureau is a large,
active, but diffused intelligence which tries
to keep a balance of decency on the earth.
Some people call it Providence, others
Nature; but it is in reality the x quantity
in the world equation, and remains unknown
and apparently unknowable in spite of all
science and natural philosophy. Lately the
people of Australia raised a lot more wheat
than they could readily consume, and stacked
it in bags all over the country. They
had done the same thing frequently
in past years; but instead of stack-
ing it for any length of time, they hustled
it as fast as the lameness of their railway
systems would permit to feed hungry mil-
lions overseas. N, looking down at the
immense piles of food, and observing that
nobody was making a shift to remove them,
promptly raised a plague of mice to restore
the balance of things. Similar plagues had
been known before. Tradition had it that
Bishop Hatto was eaten by the mouse’s big
brother, the rat. because he stored grain
that he wouldn’t use. Both mice and rats
had often appeared in enormous numbers to
ravage and destroy; but their increase
always happened at a time when, on a super-
ficial observation, there was more to eat
than seemed necessary for the larger animals.
How the mice came to raise such families
at the present time only X can explain; but
why they were raised seems evident enough.
There is too much food about, and X hates
to think of good material being wasted. So
we stumble on the theory of mice—a theory
that seems to fit all countries and all times.
Wherever there is good material lying idle
and the superior creature won’t use it, the
inferior creature takes up the running and
eats into the heart of the unexploited wealth.
It may be wealth of grain or wealth of
lands or wealth of opportunity; but X calls
the mouse the moment it seems clear that
too much of the stuff is lying around idle.
# * * #
The present plague of mice is not con-
fined to the railway sidings and stores where
the wheat bags are. It is all over Aus-
tralia. Mice eat into the heart of politics,
into the military affairs of the nation, into
the ideals that were once starred before the
eyes of the people of the new Common-
wealth. The moment the big job is left
undone there are mice, raised as by a miracle,
nibbling at the edges of the thing and fouling
and destroying far more than they can eat.
Then a disease breaks out among the mice
themselves and the heavy-weight lumpers of
the nation’s burdens hate to touch the thing
that if attacked at first would have involved
some solid lifting, but would at least have
been clean. X is. of course, curiously lack-
ing in discrimination. Just as it could not
or would not see that the wheat which it
raised armies of mice to remove would be
wanted later on, to build up force to throw
at the Kaiser, so it fails to be impressed by
a win-the-war yell or any of the catchwords
of politics. You cannot fool X that way.
nor argue with it that doing nothing at all
is the only honorable way of doing something.
The Great Unknown is as simple in its views
and dealings as primitive man or a death-
adder. All subtleties of the sort that win
elections are wasted -on it. You can’t talk
it into ineffectiveness by assuring it that
you stand for Empire. In a dull, stupid
sort of way it answers “Mice!” to any
pleading save that of honest work and
straightforward endeavor. “Mouse this
thing that could be useful but isn’t.” is the
word of command; and if the mice, in
attempting to obey, catch influenza or hay
fever and fail in their task, that probably
is due to a host of microbes called up on
the same principle because the order had
been too literally obeyed and there was too
much mouse in sight. Certain it is that
whenever the rodent is found eating into
the heart of religion or politics or laws and
Constitutions, X has had a hand in it and
some plain, dull natural law is in operation.
* * * *
The immense land area of Australia, with
its few homes and boundless potentialities,
represents in a figurative way the world’s
biggest wheatstack. Out of it could come
enough material to feed and Clothe the whole
race of man; yet at present it is the
possession of a very few millions of people
who, while they are probably sincere
in their desire to keep it, are making
comparatively little use of it. X has its
eyes on things, and begins to feel that the
time is near when the mouse must be called
in. Immense unexploited wealth cannot
lie idle even on the ground that delay in the
handling of it means that better people will
handle it in the future. X cannot see
things that way. In its view it is always
a plain case of man or mouse; and though
man gets the first choice he must decide
promptly, or his opportunity will be at least
fouled by the nibbling hosts called to the
prey. The question of effective occupation
is not merely one of international politics :
it is one in which X takes an intense inter-
est. For a generation it has been asking
what we are going to do with the Northern
Territory; and when the Commonwealth
answered that, as pledged to South Aus-
tralia. we were going to build a direct south-
to-north railway, X seemed satisfied. But
the railway isn’t built; and X doesn’t accept
any excuses about it. The mice are always


available and can be increased to any num-
ber the moment the word goes forth. Large
as are the natural resources of Australia, its
potential industrial wealth is even greater.
There is no country on earth better qualified
to manufacture its own requirements. Our
few factories are a mere satire on our possi-
bilities ; yet our alleged statesmen have up
to the present steadily side-stepped the plain
question of an effective tariff which would
create industries and keep them going on a
satisfactory basis when created. Even the
truest worshippers in the old Cobden mosque
have, however, had their faith shaken by
the German guns, and some may make a
half-hearted effort towards tariff reform. But
a half-hearted effort is no good. Either our
industrial opportunity is worth grasping or
it isn’t. X, who knows nothing about half
measures, is watching; and the mice of all
the world have their teeth sharpened for the
great nibbling. In every direction the same
forces operate; and everywhere inefficiency
and delay are under the same threat. Leave
the wheatstacks standing and the destroyers
will arrive to schedule time; lift the bur-
dens of opportunity and X smiles approval.
In Europe there is a large, wild beast to
hunt and destroy; in Australia the subtler
attack of the small, unclean thing is the real
danger.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
How About Winning the War?
Since the Federal elections, a month ago, it
has been mentioned 7469 times that the poll-
ing revealed among other things that (1)
Australia was determined to win the war;
(2) Australia responded magnificently to
the call of Empire; (3) Billjim would put
additional ginger into the fight because he
knew the nation was behind him; (4) the
Commonwealth stood justified before the
Allies ; and (5) all the rest of it. During the
election the Ministry proclaimed itself a
Win-the-War outfit. Since the poll was
taken the war-winners have poured the oil
of gladness over themselves at frequent inter-
vals. A month has passed. If this is not
long enough for blowing off hot air it ought
to be. The question now is. What do Min-
isters propose to do? Wars are not won by
general elections. So far as The Bulle-
tin is able to interpret warfare, there seems
no getting away from the conclusion that
wars are won by defeating enemies in
battle. Battles are won by men. There is
only one historical precedent for supposing
that they can be won by jaw, and this is
open to grave suspicion of being inapplicable
to the German. Either Australia is going
to keep the Billjim regiments reinforced or
not. If it is going to be done, the Minis-
try’s dutv is the simple one of promptly
explaining how. If it can't explain how,
then the Ministry must be brushed aside and
the people asked what they think of some
system of selective draft.

Proportional Representation —in Par-
liament and out of It.
J. E. Ogden, Tasmanian M.L.A. and ex-
Minister, supplies some thoughtful conclu-
sions :
The article in The Bulletin of May 17, dealing
with the Federal system of election, puts the matter
clearly from one point of view but misses a point of
importance.
When the Convention which drafted the Federal
Constitution gave the States equal representation in
the Senate, the idea was that the House would be
free from party and would directly represent the
States. It was not contemplated that the two-party
system would develop as it has done during recent
years. The late election very clearly demonstrated
that a man who runs as an independent without a
party machine behind him has to-day no chance
whatever of success. The electors of Tasmania
would not have Colonel Cameron, though he certainly
had more claim upon them, if win-the-war was the
issue, than the others who had merely talked. Colonel
Cameron, when he failed to get a commission in
Australia, went to England and then to France as
an officer and did his bit. His 60-odd years would
not stand the strain, and he was invalided home.
Thereupon he offered to help win the war in the
Federal House; but he could only get a few thousand
votes. His brother Norman, who ran for Wilmot as
a freelance, polled but a few hundreds, and no other
independent in any part of the Commonwealth did
much better. This emphasises the fact, if emphasis
were necessary, that it is impossible to break through
the two party machines. No Senate candidate, so
far as one could gather, dealt, even casually, with
purely State interests. They talked party, they fought
for party, and the successful go to the Senate to
carry on the party fight. This may be better than
becoming purely a State frighter, but it emphasises
the anomaly of the present system of representation.
This phase of the question is more important than
even the non-representation of minorities. Under
strict party discipline, so long' as a Government gets
a majority, no matter how small, it can carry on;
and if the minority had its exact mathematical pro-
portion of representation in the House, it would
still be a small voice crying in the political wilder-
ness, unable to alter the policy of the party in
power. The minority would still be unrepresented,
sy far as statutory power was concerned. Propor-
tional representation would not alter that position;
as a matter of fact, it might tend to intensify the
evils of the system of “spoils to the victors.” Let
us see. The Tasmanian Parliament is elected under
a proportional system. Premier Lee had after last
election a. majority of one after the Speaker was
chosen. He carried his policy just as easily as
though his majority had been 20. The 14 Labor
members elected by the minority in the country were
powerless. No Labor measures could be carried. The
minority, although comparatively few votes behind
the majority at the election, for all practical pur-
poses might as well have been altogether unrepre-
sented in the House. Some Government adherents in
some cases really desired to support an Opposition
proposal, but owing to the Government's small
majority, due to the proportional system, the whip
cracked and they dared not offend the party organisa-
tion, for fear of being dropped at the next election.
This does not condemn proportional representation.
It is the correct method of choosing Parliamentary
members. (Incidentally, cither the French or Belgian
system or the single transferable vote with the uni-
form quota will give exact proportional representa-
tion, and either is an improvement on the Tasmanian
preferential vote with divisional quotas.) But in
order to get the full advantages which are claimed
for proportional representation, and which it will
surely give, elective Ministries should be its natural
corollary, coupled with the Initiative Referendum.
The Senate would then cease to be a huge and expen-
sive joke, and could carry out the functions for which
it was created. Party organisation might then con-
tinue without any of the present resultant evils, and
with advantage to the people.
To-day’s Job and the Specks on the Far
Horizon.
When Labor first came into being as a
political force there were two things of
primary importance to it. The first was
to understand itself. The next was to
make the other fellow understand. To
some extent Labor did understand what it
wanted to do : to a greater extent, perhaps,
so did the other fellow. The rest of the
yarn is mostly about a struggle for jobs, an
ant-ridden platform, chaos and finally a
w r aking up to the discovery that a yell was
all that remained on the premises. For
the last three or four years Labor has no
more understood itself than the fourth
dimension. But health will be restored in
good time, and it is encouraging to find the
Worker ready to look squarely at the
truth. Listen :
Labor has got to provide itself with a new objective
—not a remote, intangible, ambiguous aspiration, but
an ideal of a serviceable kind, able to stand a heap
of wear and tear.
Boil it down to this —that the first job on
hand is to find out if the goal lies N.W., and,
if it does, to knock off steering S.E. Labor
has been steering the wrong way too long.
It has been blithering about things that
mattered nothing. The Worker thinks
that the way of salvation is to be found by
concentrating on an industrial revolution,
the annihilation of Capitalism and the
nationalisation of industries by handing
them over to be operated and controlled by
industrial unions for the common good.
Well, the world, if it escapes the heel of
militarism—which is not at all certain —is
probably blundering on to Socialism of some
sort. It. is legitimate that Australian
Labor should help in the big push. But
there is a practical side, and what the com-
munity wants to understand from Labor or
Fat or any other group of partisans is not
what may be proposed by someone else
when thp time is ripe, but what one or
other of them proposes to do now. It is
no more use explaining what will finally be
produced than it would have been for Moses
to have requested the Israelites to feel happy
in the Promised Land without going there.
The immediate and specific business on hand
for Labor is to explain how the industrial
revolution is going to be worked; to define
the implements that are to be used in the
destruction of Fat; to indicate the methods
by which industry is to be controlled by
trade unions. Meanwhile this paper has a
notion that Labor should consider whether
a revolution in which Labor will escape dis-
aster can be assisted by the adoption of go-
slow principles; whether the fomenting of
trivial strikes brings industrial Socialism
any nearer; and whether tightening the
grip of Capitalism on the next generation,
and going on the spree with the proceeds
of a mortgage executed in favor of Fat,
makes Capitalism any less severe.

An Affrighted Squeak from Propputy.
The Manufacturers’ Conference sitting in
Sydney last week arrived at the conclusion
that “the taxation of capital wealth is fun-
damentally wrong, and that all taxation
should fall upon the product of capital
wealth.” The wording of this decision
would stand a poor chance of getting first
prize for lucidity from a Professor of Eco-
nomics. What is meant, apparently, is that
for the purpose of raising public revenue
income alone shpuld be tapped—that on
earnings the burden of taxation should rest,
and after earnings have been converted into
“capital wealth” they should not be touched
any more. It is a queer, disordered sort of
notion this; and of all people in the world
to put it forward the enterprising, toiling
manufacturer ought to be the very last.
Nearly everywhere in the world the taxation
of capital as capital is in general practice,
and it has the sanction of every economist
entitled to a hearing. Not only is capital
taxed ; it is appropriated in lumps. Where
in economic literature could the proposers
and supporters of this resolution find any
justification for holding that the taxation of
land, for example, is wrong? Or how would
they propose to convince anybody that the
arguments on which death and succession
duties are based are unsound? Theoreti-
cally, there is little excuse for taxing the
productive skill and enterprise of anyone.
In practice some measure of this is inevit-
able. Theoretically, there are dozens
of reasons why capital in some of
its forms or at some stage of its
existence should be raided. In practice
it is raided with general approval. If
in Australia it has to some extent escaped,
it has only been through the community
either resorting to the expedient of the
lOU or throwing an altogether oppressive
burden upon industry.

The Thing that Looks Like a Kind
Elephant but May Become an
Octopus.
About a dozen years ago Joe Ward, of
Maoriland, gave forth a loud whisper relative
to the coastal seas and the need for keeping
the shipping connections between port and
port in the hands of the Government of the
Ricketty Isles. Nothing was clone about it;
nothing was meant to be done. But there
was more point in Ward’s remarks than
was generally admitted at the time. The
Union Steamship Co. is the practical overlord
of whole districts in Maoriland which depend
upon it for their outlet to the world. It
has a complete monopoly of the carrying
trade of these places, supplies them with
their mails, and provides the only means by
which the settlers can reach any other spot
on the earth. This monopoly, however, has
never been used as a means of grinding the
faces of the poor. The service of steamers
has been good, fares and rates have gener-
ally not been excessive; and the Maorilander
has taken rather a pride in the red funnel
which stood for splendid business enterprise
coupled with a lot of decency. Yet in all
this there was an element of risk. Shipping
combines are the order of the day; and the
concern which started so humbly in Dunedin
40 years ago and grew so rapidly to power
may at any time be changed into something
entirely different in spirit and method. The
news that the P. and 0. Co. is linking up in
some way not yet explained with the Union
Co. gives point to the suggested danger.
While it is likely that the coastal trade will
remain under the new arrangement exactly
as it is at present, there is no guarantee that
under the next trade combine or the next it
will continue to do so; and with every amal-
gamation the power of the concern, which
hitherto has been used only for good,
will be enormously increased for evil.
The plain fact is that Maoriland’s coastal
sea is its main highway, and that the
machinery which links the land north and
south of Cook Straits has the same relation-
ship to the community as the railways which
cross the Australian continent have to the
people of the Commonwealth. To say that
the sea is free and that the State can at
any time decide to have its own steamers
does not settle the matter. The building of
a sufficient fleet for all trade purposes could
not be accomplished in an hour, even if the
cash required were immediately available;
and the pull of a giant trade combine in-
finitely greater and more powerful in the
future than anything now in sight might
make the swift raising of the necessary
money for so vast a State enterprise almost
impossible.
The Story of Forty-five Fit Men and the
Lord Knows How Many Asses.
“G.R.H.” : For over four months I and 44
other fit men had been in training for active
service as reinforcements for the R.A. Naval
Bridging Train. Together with other South
Australians I was given final leave. The
day we arrived back in our Victorian camp
we were told that the unit had been dis-
banded and that we were discharged. Most
of us applied for transfers, but the authori-
ties made no attempt to help us. I myself,
with several others, was given no option but
to be discharged. So. after taking final fare-
wells at home amid enthusiastic handshakes,
we were compelled to amble back to S.A..
enlist all over again, and start training—for
another four months probably. After giving-
up good positions and wasting all this time
and public money, we find ourselves exactly
where we started last Christmas. All along
the camp had been a solemn farce, conducted
on most erratic lines. Nobody seemed to
know what we were or what we were
intended to do on the other side. And after
all we were emptied out into the street to
re-enlist or look for new civilian jobs just
as we pleased.

On the old question of Billjim's discipline:
As an Australian N.C.O. attached to a British unit
I’ve been able to mark the real difference between
JnißiLii and Tommy in the matter of discipline. And
this is how I found it: our men only lack what they
don’t need.
I have worked with Tommy both under fire and
away from it, and parties of Australians have occa-
sionally been detailed to me at the same time.
Always I have found that, though Thomas may be a
paragon of appalling discipline in the drill-hall or
on the barrack-square, when it comes to the practi-
cal necessity for order and discipline under unusual
conditions, it’s the Australian who has the real thing,
in the form of a natural sense of method and per-
sonal responsibility. An Australian party may start
on a job with a few candid, outspoken curses. If it
is a frivolous and unessential form of labor, they
may even refuse to start. But here there is not much
time for things unimportant; so, provided Jimbill
has no doubts upon this point, and gets going, you
can leave him to a job and depend on finding it in
the end not only done but done earnestly. Tommy,
maybe, is never openly insubordinate; but through
the whole job he is slacking down, and may be
depended on for a reluctant and slovenly finish.
Comparison of people under fire is getting on to a
delicate subject. But here the main difference is
accounted for by the Australian’s super-casualness,
and not the Tommies’ lack of courage. The latter
under fire are as nervy as horses. At the first shot,
if it’s a shell, they look for cover—which is rather
a good idea. If it continues they become afflicted
with a superfluity of eyes and ears. The Australians
stand out in the open completely absorbed in “what’s
goin’ on.” If the explosion is a rattling good one
they may even be moved to an outburst of cheerful
appreciation. It’s only when one lobs in shockingly
close proximity that it suddenly dawns on them that
Australia is a good place to return to some day.
Then they join the Tommies with considerable speed.
But to expect all the virtues of the versatile Brit-
ish race consolidated in one type is asking for the
superman. And he can t be made to order.
* —
The American “Commission House” sys-
tem may make its appearance in Australia
any day now. It has points to recommend
it. The Australian manufacturer is mostly
handicapped by lack of funds, so that he has
to insist on cash. A manufacturer operat-
ing through a commission house makes out
his invoice in duplicate and presents a copy
(together with signed delivery docket) to
the house, which pays the face amount of
the invoice less 3 per cent. This margin is
the reward of the commission house or bank
for the small risk taken on approved
accounts, and the 30 or 60 days’ credit given
to the purchasing firms. Longer terms are
arranged at the rate of 4 per cent, per
month. A man finding himself with made-
up stock and short of money can warehouse
his stuff, insurance and rent free, on the
commission house’s premises, and draw
against it to the extent of at least two-thirds
of its value, interest computed at 6 per cent,
per annum. As a manufacturer invariably
gets credit for his raw material, it is seen
that by this means the working capacity of
capital is about doubled.
“IX”: Here’s a plan for turning the “shout-
ing” habit to practical account. Let the
Federal Government issue sixpenny war-loan
stamps to hotel bars, giving brokerage to the
lessees. Then when Fitzbill insists on a
“shout,” Billjim can say: “Righto, mine’s a
war-stamp!” It would be better than gulp-
ing an unwanted twopenn’orth of aerated
water or taking a thrippenny cigar, and at
the same time it would give a lift to the War
Treasury. Thirty-five of these war-stamps
have a face value of fl, payable in three
years; and lots of us will be glad of a pound
in three years.
♦-
The puzzle of the Russian situation is the
puzzle of the Russian character. A writer
who knew Russia claimed 30 years ago that
the national characteristic was a passion
for self-sacrifice. If that is true the Rus-
sian revolution might easily be one of the
great landmarks in the history of man, and
at the same time a pretty disastrous busi-
ness for other nations/ of harder and more
practical fibre which are linked up in a war-
alliance with the revolutionaries. During
the Russo-Japanese war Tolstoi openly
advised conscripts to refuse to join the fight-
ing ranks, pointing out that they might as
well die at home for the cause of peace and
humanity as cross Siberia to die in battle
against a foe whom they did not hate and in
a cause which they did not understand.
Whether any number of recruits actually
tried to put Tolstoi’s advice into practice
we have no means of knowing; but it was
the sort of advice which could only be given
to Russians without provoking laughter.
No Englishman, Frenchman or Italian would
go voluntarily to martyrdom while there was
a decent chance of fight or flight; but appar-
ently the yearning otherworldliness of the
Russian amounts to a sort of fatalism which
is beyond ordinary human estimate. Just
now the theories and arguments of the new
republicans seem to be unnerving their fight-
ing arm; and while some among them are
trying to dictate to the world the terms on
which they will continue to use bayonet
or bomb, it begins to be doubtful whether
they can put up a scrap in time to be worth
bargaining for.
In its search for coin the N.-S, Wales Gov-
ernment has hit upon a breezy idea as far
as the wheat cocky is concerned. In assess-
ing him for income-tax the Department pro-
ceeds, not upon what he has received, but
upon what it reckons he is going to get in
the sweet by-and-bye from the Wheat Pool.
Demanding a return of the wheat he has
harvested, whether delivered to the pool or
still on the farm, the Department valued the
1916-17 crop at 4s. per bushel and proposed
to ask Cocky to pay income-tax on that
basis. The trifling detail that he has so far
The Submarine.

Spurning the shore and outer quay.
Set for the straits and spoil.
Who glimpses my grey snout from the sea,
Laid on his cross-track wickedly,
Him let the saints assoil!
Fang from the foam that flashes by,
Giver of Fate’s decrees.
The viper of the drifts am I,
The adder of the seas !
By bar and cape, by sheltering cay
I run awash, or bide
The transport in the channel-way,
The trawler lurching for the bay,
The liner racing wide :
Regent of murder manifold.
Cold-hearted, swift, unguessed,
I strike, and what I will I hold —•
The dumb sea takes the rest!
And you who risk the road where runs
My eager periscope,
If I should speak you once, but once.
Forsake your chattering taffrail-guns,
And slip the davit-rope!
Leap for the boats —or dare and drown,
While, by the doom you dree.
Your broken bulwarks sidle down
Into the depths to me!
Tiie mirk night wanes, the wan dawn wends
To grey-faced haggard day ;
Sleepless and cold my eye attends
The hapless keel the deep sea sends.
The freighter marked for prey—
A shape that blots the sky below.
Blown smoke that veers and dips
(Brave hearts to-day they be, who go
Down to the sea in ships !).
Up through the grey! A din of guns!
The sea-dulled echoes break ;
An answering roar that shocks and stuns,
And ’neath the shuddering surface runs
The white torpedo-wake!
Listen, and know the punching blow,
Hoarse shout and cloven scream.
The crumpling plates that give and go,
The rush of bursting steam !
A soulless shade, a lurking thing.
Here, where you may not mark,
Safe from your gunner’s reckoning.
Waiting the plunge, I lie and swing
Down in the underdark;
The air that bursts your decking free,
A rush of mantling green.
A whirl of foam—- and all shall be
As though you had not been!
And ye who, bold or overfleet.
Win through the hazard-cast,
Read in the flotsam at your feet
The mercy that I frame and mete,
The track that I have passed—
Raffle of ropes, a riddled boat.
Clenched hands on shattered spars,
Faces that lift and turn and float
White to the whiter stars!
Stripped of all ruth, out-facing fear.
My spur the hate that goads.
In fog-screened dawn or starshine clear
I wait your funnels streaming near
Along the ocean-roads.
Cruiser that drives, or tramp that plods
’Twixt deep and stoic sky,
When that we meet, call on your gods
To aid —so shall not I!
Sired by man, conceived of strife,
Suckled by death am, I,
Savage and swift, of purpose rife.
Careless of life, yet leased with life
By God Who knotceth why;
Doom from the foam that breaks beside,
Weapon of Fate's decrees.
Assassin of the straits T glide,

only received 2s. 6d. per bushel for it was
cheerfully brushed asid,e. Expert opinion
argued that it would realise 4s. finally, and
that sufficed. It might—but a few million-
odd busy mice were not reckoned on! In
the same way the 1915-16 crop was valued
and taxed at 3s. 6d., although at the time
the cocky was getting an advance of only
2s. 6d. Following a protest from the
growers, the taxation people later on agreed
to assess the 1916-17 wheat on the basis
of 3s. 6d. per bushel. The cocky has actu-
ally received 2s. 6d. Is this a square deal?
With the havoc of mice and weather it is
hard to say what the return will be, and
when it will be available. All the expense
of combating the plague, of refilling bags,
rebuilding stacks, destroying the mice (both
the dead and live ones), all of which has to
be done with labor at costly rates, has to
come out of the cockies’ pocket through the
pool—and that itself is a wrong. The
growers have had a hard row to hoe for the
last four years, and many of the best of them
are getting out of the business ; heavy ex-
penses, bad seasons and mice plagues, added
to the circumstances of the war, have been
too much to bear. Now the State irritates the
sore. Why can’t it wait until the cocky,
gets his money and then take its toll?
Labor is Still Looking for the Easy
Way.
A N. S. Wales Labor Conference has
appointed a committee to draw up resolu-
tions for transmission to the Socialist Con-
gress sitting at Leeds (England) “covering
the attitude of this Conference towards the
War.” The decision was arrived at after
listening to speeches in advocacy of “stop-
ping the war” and “collaborating with Petro-
grad” and so on. Judging by the “loud
cheers” and “prolonged applause” and the
general tone of the proceedings, it can be
almost taken for granted that “official
Labor,” in N. S. Wales at any rate, is
going to commit itself to a stop-the-war yell,
and anyone who questions the sanity of this
will find himself declared bogus. As it is
important that the citizens of Australia
should have a clear understanding of where
“official Labor” is—of the real meaning of
its opposition to compulsory service and of
its fervid advocacy of voluntaryism—this
preliminary step towards candor is at least
to be welcomed. But it is welcome on that
ground only. That it will break Labor into
fragments, and make of it an object of con-
tempt to the great body of Australian-
born men and women, this paper has
no shadow of doubt. Labor, “official”
or otherwise, cannot monkey with this
war business. If it must, in order to
gratify its appetite for yells, start howl-
ing “Stop the war,” very well! But if it
does not want to be a quitter, then it must
get rid of those influences whicli make it
look like one. There can be no half-
way place—no cave in which the civic
cur and the patriot may skulk together.
If the war stopped to-morrow Germany
would pull out a winner. Would that be of
any advantage to the world’s democracies?
It is not by wind and froth that human free-
dom can be saved in this tremendous conflict,
nor is it by lying down with a whine before
an enemy that Australians can preserve any-
thing worth having. Talk of “peace without
annexation or indemnities” is blither. Does
official Labor want to see the German in-
stalled again at Rabaul and conducted back
with three cheers to Samoa? Does it sup-
pose that peace to-morrow would not mean
this and very much more? That the slaughter
in Europe should stir humanitarian sym-
pathy is to be expected. No one can con-
template the horrors of the time without
loathing. But all that has nothing to do
with whether the barbarians who launched
this tragedy on the world should be handed
the fruits of their infamy. It is they who
should stop the war, not their present and
prospective victims. And it strikes The
Bulletin that Australian Labor would be
better employed in persuading them to take
their bloody hands from the windpipe of
civilisation than barracking for everybody
to stand aside and witness the throttling of
Democracy.
The Defence Department isn't the only
one rioting in extravagance. In re-bagging
the thousands of mice-damaged bags of wheat
at Williamstown (Vic.) the practice is to
slash the sack down the middle, sling it aside
and sell a pile of a thousand or so as old
bagging. Cute buyers have these sewn up,
and the mice holes patched, and they get 6d.
to Bd. for them as secondhand bags. The
Wheat Board could get sd? each for them—
instead of the half-penny they now realise—
if it didn’t instruct its employees to slash
them down instead of opening them properly.
One of those straws which Labor has been
wearing in its hair caught fire and burned to
a mere black smut when a gang of fettlers
on the Overland line returned to a station
408 miles from Port Augusta at 5.3 p.m.—
three minutes after “knock off” —and next
day refused to turn-to till the ganger booked
the three minutes overtime. Chief-engineer
Bell, weary of it all, said they were not the
sort of men he was wanting, and fortunately
he had in Willy Watt a Minister with
enough grit to support him.
Sydney Labor Council lately passed a
resolution in favor of a shorter working day
"in order to absorb the workers at present
unemployed.” Doesn’t that Council boast
one individual wuth brains enough to pole-
axe the cranky idea that a country has a
fixed amount of work wffiich has to be divided
among so many workers? If there were the
slightest germ of sense in the idea it would
be as well for us all to toil an hour a day,
divide our jobs among eight workers and
have a quiet, restful time for 23 out of the
24 hours. The trouble is that a short course
of that policy would bring us to a diet of
plain rice or dry bread and a costume consist-
ing of one fig-leaf. Can’t these men see that
the more workers there are in a community
and the more each worker produces the
greater the wealth produced, the more capi-
tal there is available for further industrial
employment, and the higher the wages that
can be paid?
As forecasted in The Bulletin a few
weeks ago, the new Workmen’s Compensa-
tion Act (N.S.W.), operating as from the
Ist July next, will prove a boon to lawyers.
Although, apparently, a very clearly-worded
piece of legislation, it takes several bulky
volumes to contain all the decisions of the
English Courts on the 1910 Act, of which
the N. S. Wales law is practically a copy.
One point, though, has been settled to the
fullest satisfaction of injured claimants, viz.,
the definition of the word “accident” (Clover
and Clayton v. Hughes). A man had to
screw a nut on to a bolt, which meant
giving it six turns with a spanner. The
man was far gone in heart disease, and
whilst making or concluding the second turn
he fell dead with a ruptured artery. For the
employers it was successfully argued in the
lower courts that any exertion required by
this simple operation could not constitute an
accident; but it was held on appeal to the
Lords that the man had been killed by an
accident, the Judges expressing the opinion
that an accident is none the less an accident
because it happens to diseased tissues. This
doctrine, now established' in English Law,
will hard hit the lowly householder. How
can he know when he engages merely Mary
Ermyntrude that she possesses a jumpy
heart, an old strain, or housemaid’s-knee —
unless he looks for it? Yet the slightest
strain may land him either with a death
claim for three years’ earnings (including
keep), or a pensioner at half-pay up to £750.
W. H. Beaglehole, just dead in Adelaide
at 84, was a great man at getting in at the
beginning of things. Long ago his firm
built the Adelaide Children’s Hospital and
Labor Prison. Then it did a lot towards
building the mining towns of Wallaroo and
Moonta, and Beaglehole found it good
enough to settle there as a hotelkeeper. Thus
he came to start what are now the Lion brew-
ery, the Thebarton distillery, and (at
Broken Hill) the Waverley brewery. He
was the last survivor of the strong Adelaide
contingent which had a hand in starting the
Grand Hotel in Melbourne; also at odd times
he was a director of brickworks and of the
B. 11. Junction ; also a grazier, ah orchard-
proprietor, and. back in the ’Bo’s, a member
of S. Aus. Assembly.
Adelaide thought an air-raid had really
come one night last week. A motor-builder’s
and a carrier’s place in Wakefield-street
went up in flame. There were in storage
some big cylinders of ammonia, and these
exploded one by one. Firemen pluckily
chanced being “gassed,” and smashed in one
or two; but the others bombarded the neigh-
borhood —one bomb 7ft. by 3ft. hurtled on to
a roof 100 yards away—and woke up the
whole city and suburbs to talk excitedly of
Zeppelins. Somehow, nobody had thought
of the innocent freezing-stuff as a high ex-
plosive.
C. E. B. Maybury, sheriff of N. S. Wales,
retired just in time to escape managing the
first execution at Long Bay. This ex-Lord
High Executioner was born at sea in 1853,
but within the shore limit, which made him
an Australian. The ship was near Cape
Bridgewater at the time; so Bridgewater he
was named. His father was Governor of
Berrima Gaol and afterwards Deputy-
Sheriff at Goulburn.
George Kirkpatrick, killed in France
lately, saw his first active service at Broken
Hill in the early months of the war. As a
constable he had a hand in the capture of
the ice-cream cart manned by a crazy Turk
who had fired on a picnic train, killing a
passenger, and who put up a brisk defence
against the battalion of Hops sent to arrest
him. The scrap with Abdul made
Kirkpatrick want more, and he enlisted in
time to be in the landing at Gallipoli. A
military medal came to him last year at
rozieres.

Barry Lupine, who runs the stage busi-
ness at Melbourne King’s, ought to have
been warned by the first-night slowness of
“Very Good Eddie” to speed-up the initial
production of “The White Chrysanthemum”
on Saturday. During the latter half the
intervals between laughs were too long: the
co.’s weakness in singing got too much oppor-
tunity to make itself felt, and the prettiest
of the scenes became picturesquely tedious
and poetically dull. For “The Chrysanthe-
mum” is highly picturesque and poetical
compared with the departed “Eddie.” The
little bit of plot has a reminder of “The
Geisha” and a hint of “Butterfly” in its
composition. Lilian Tucker has somehow
escaped to Japan in charge of widow Daisy
Revette, with a view to getting married to
an English or American naval young man,
who has apparently fixed her up in a bunga-
low, where she sleeps amidst the ladies of
the Chorus and receives rich gifts of wear-
ing apparel from her fiancA Admiral
George Whitehead is father to the lieutenant
aforesaid, and, when he brings along heiress
Fayette Perry for his son to marry, the
parental curse can only be averted by dis-
guising fair Lilian as a Jap of doubtful
character, and stating that she and the
bungalow belong to Hon. Andrew Higginson,
a chuckle-headed yachting chappie who has
blown in to save the situation. When the
widow who chaperoned Lilian has duly cap-
tured the Admiral, and the heiress has in-
clined her heart towards Hon. Chucklehead,
the yarn is fully spun.
* * * *
Woven into the narrative is the Chappie’s
irresponsible manservant Samuel, who goes
as he pleases and is generally humorous.
Lupino seems to have been measured for the
part. If he isn’t quite a George Lauri, he is
more than an Edward Lauri. Also, Higgin-
son, admirably made-up, deserves a little
more scope than he gets for his realistic
sketch of the ass in upnali circles. Donaghey,
Bristowe and Charles Pope (with his com-
plexion lightened) are three Jap policemen
who chase Lupino in a pantomime spirit;
Whitehead is the solemn Admiral who sings
about Britannia; Beck is a serio-comic
valet to the alleged hero. Vernon Irv-
ing, a newcomer, plays the tall and
unimpressive hero. He dances not,
neither does he sing to speak of. As a con-
tribution to the vocal strength of the co. he
amounts to a bone button in an assortment
of traybits. There is some charming music

in “The White Chrysanthemum,” yet nobody
lifts any particular ballad or cheaper ditty
into prominence. Miss Tucker certainly has
a mezzo-conprano voice with some virtue
in it, but she cannot do half-justice to her
chances, nor is she notable for blonde beauty
and willowy grace after she has assumed her
Japanese disguise. She promises well at the
outset when she Awakes from dreams of love
in attractive undies, and then she loses her
identity in a kimono. Scenery by Rowell
and Clint, the dressing of a numerous body
of pit-a-pat ladies and the efforts of the lime-
light man and his myrmidon the rising-moon
shifter, help the orchestral accompaniment
to make the show soothing when it goes
slow. But it ought not to be going slow
next week.
If there were such a thing as “legitimate”
musical farce, “Joyous Jones” would be a
good sample of it. George Willoughby’s un-
pretentious revival of Jones at Melbourne
Princess’s is almost an exact reproduction

of the farcical comedy of other days, inter-
rupted by a few songs (not utterly irrele-
vant) in which eight extra girls participate.
The show as it stands is a poor relation of
the sort of musical comedy that Hugh Ward
and Willoughby staged at the same house
long ago. “What Happened to Jones,” a
rapid ’Murkan farce in its day, has not yet
lost all its dash, although its main idea of
humor is out of date. The first duty of an
elderly stage parent was to keep a harmless
adventure a secret from his wife in the days
when Jones was young. His prospective
son-in-law was wont to assist him in a con-
spiracy of silence, which ultimately cast a
strong suspicion of lunacy on the rest of the
household. The laws of Respectability are
more liberal these times, and the secret
which is kept dark from a stage matron
must be a pretty giddy one. In “Joyous
Jones” the best that can be done with the
name-part is achieved by Willoughby, who
gets good enough support from Nable,
Halley, Brookes and all the ladies bar one.
The barred one tries hard to suggest a
Swedish parlor-maid, and if she keeps on
trying she may eventually get there. Frank
Brookes has a nice voice for an artless musi-
cal number, and the eight girls are useful in
several changes of costume, especially when
Willoughby happens as an appalling carica-
ture of a baby. It seems necessary to
make haste to laugh at this monstrous in-
fant lest one should weep instead.
“A Little Bit of Fluff” at Melbourne
Royal is a mechanical joke in three shrieks
which tries for laughs with physical violence
when other means fail. The riot com-
mences with the discovery of a pearl neck-
lace in the pocket of John Ayres after he
has been painting the town violet with a
brisk young damsel of impaired reputation.
John postpones explanations to his missus
by presenting the trinket to that angry lady,
and is basely enjoying his duplicity when his
over-night partner, Mamie Scott, butts in
to demand the return of the necklace, which,
it seems, she has borrowed from a rajah.
The Bad Boy’s efforts are thereupon concen-
trated on keeping Mamie quiet and his wife
in a state of blissful credulity, while he
endeavors to raise sufficient coin to buy the
Hindu potentate another set of gauds. Ayres,
assisted by an oddity suffering from surplus
hair and religious enthusiasm, proposes to
draw the cash on a bogus plea for damages
from an omnibus co., but he misses the
vehicle, so to speak, and is kept busy mul-
tiplying his identities in order to dodge a
charge of fraud. At this stage the proceed-
ings are subjected to interruption by offi-
cials from the omnibus co., and, despite
protracted knockabout business with blankets
and pyjamas, and the intrusion of an old
aunt who gets the conspirators out of their
difficulties, the entertainment slows dow r n
to the speed of a funeral at Geelong.
The briskest bits are due to the hard work of
Percy Marmont in the part of John Ayres.
Percy often employs rapid language to con-
ceal his acting, but he is still successful in
conveying the brazen effrontery of the stage
profligate with the early-morning habit.

finger and the paralysis of a shy maiden who
has kissed her first man. Mamie Scott,
interpreted by Dorothy Purdell, is a dress-
maker’s exclamation in a piece of staccato
prose. Her frocks match her suspected
record, and her lingerie deserves its frequent
publication. Daisy Atherton has to keep
Pamela Ayres in a condition of hurry and
indignation, and has just sufficient voice and
energy for the job. The solemnity of
Eardley Turner as Dr. Bigland stands out
almost grotesquely in such farcical surround-
ings. Rene Tanswell is tall and emphatic
as an irrelevant aunt in purple raiment;
and May Nightingale defies competition as a
rough elderly servant, while Eileen Robinson
portrays a lady-help of the tender, boudoir
variety. The farce is only for a few more
nights, for Cyril Maude in “Grumpy” is
promised on the 16th.
Marie Tempest's polished art and equally
well-cared for reputation are carrying that
out-of-date comedy, “The Marriage of

C. J. —is having Nellie Stewart’s attention at
Sydney Tivoli this week. The star is as
humorous as ever when, disguised in Jef-
freys’ wig and gown in the Judge’s own
study, she scratches wildly with a quill
while his Honor’s doddering serving-man
potters about lighting unnecessary candles.
On Saturday all hands move on to Act 4
and the sweetly refined but improbable
climax. Willard and Wilson, the black-
faced practitioners, have a new lunatic farce
which isn’t as meaty as the old one in the
detective college; but there is a big laugh
when the small partner makes a straw bed
with a hayfork. The Yates pair dance so
well that they should cut off the singing,
and Talleur Andrews insists on sandwiching
some wooden-legged war-songs between his
music. Gwen Lewis smiles as broadly as
ever at her piano, and Peggy Peate and her
six Tivoli Girls do a cheerful songandance.
Ada Reeve and the supporting co. begin
their season on Wednesday next.

On Sydney screens this week :
Hoyt's: A six-reeler of Booth Tarkington’s “Con-
quest of Canaan” ; also “The Cloud,” a tangle of
mixed loves and busted fortunes, with usual scoundrel
accessories.
Crystal Palace and Lyric : “The Mormon Maid,”
the dramatic exposure of Mormonism which the Film
Censorship held up at the request of Mormon Gover-
nor Bamberger, because it might hurt the feelings of
the simple citizens of Utah.
Lyceum: “The Desert Man,” in which Wm. S. Hart
cleans up the Wild West with a six-shooter; and
“Babette,” a Vitagraph comedy-drama of French
gaol life.

At Melbourne Majesty’s the two bearded
strangers who faintly resemble one another
at a distance will be mistaken only once
more for the little man who is strikingly
dissimilar. Just here the writer may re-
mark that three cases of mistaken identity
on the stage couldn’t possibly be reasonable,
otherwise the audience wouldn’t see the joke
for certain, and the deception would be no
laughing matter. It is necessary to insist
upon the crass stupidity of the people on
the stage where triplicates are concerned.
No matter. “The Three Twins” retire to-
night, and the more operatic co. returns on
Saturday with “The Pink Lady.”
Ada Reeve’s good time at Melbourne
Tivoli ends on Saturday, when she probably
will get the whole congregation joining in the
chorus of “Tennessee.” The bill remains
much the same as lately, and the same old
approval is recorded every night.
“His Father’s Son,” another link in the
endless chain of thrills from the Metro
studio, is exhibiting the features of Lionel
Barrymore at Hoyt’s Melbourne theatres
this week. In this effusion Lionel threatens
to be novel and interesting in an original
line of business, but eventually he follows
a film-trail which The Bulletin has often
travelled. The other notable is Gertrude
McCoy, a recent arrival on Hoyt’s, screens,
who is fascinating movie-fiends in “The
Lash of Destiny.”
William S. Hart is showing a visage like
Gibraltar in profile in a Western Amurkan
gambling yarn, “The Square Deal Man, at
Melbourne Majestic this week. Hart wins
a ranch at roulette and explodes less gun-
powder than usual in his endeavor to hold
the property. Dorothy Dalton flashes into
view in “Back of the Man.” Also there is
Douglas Fairbanks tickling people to come
again in a two-reel detective farce, ‘I he
Mystery of the Leaping Fish.”

Of a wintry art show:—
The Victorian Artists’ annual exhibition shows
President Max Meldrum howling derision at con-
ventional potboilers. He has a portrait of Justice
a’Beckett, dashed off in the defiant style that makes
the man’ subordinate to the mannerism. A study
of a girl in Polish costume, with colored ribbons
hanging garishly at the shoulder, is as obtrusive as
a trombone at a prayer meeting. Meldrum’s sombre
landscapes are less distinctive of his habit of
making Art a matter of scientific calculation. In
his little and not very characteristic lot Hans Hey-
sen tempers the sunlight to the shorn scenery.
W. B. Mclnnes gets a charming mid-day note into
two fine open-air canvases; also he hangs a twi-
light effect of two nymphs bathing, with their
pink nudity fading into the shadows of the evening.
The other contributors cannot compare in stature
with the forenamed trio; but some of them furnish
interesting work. Miss Cr.mbrae Stewart still waves
her pastel among the palefaces, and Harry B. Harri-
son presents an old model in several disguises. The
one important nude, “Niphetos,” by Miss May Rox-
burgh, reverses the Christian idea of grace before
meat. The portraits, “The Green Hat” and “The
Boy Scout,” by Frank Powne, are a trifle loud. G.
It. Growcott, H. G. Tuomy, and one or two others
also reject the notion that pictures should be seen
and not heard. F. G. Reynolds’s landscapes sug-
gest that Nature works her marvels by machinery,
but he has a comely sketch of a flapper in lavender.
W. Nicholls Anderson’s “Mosman’s Bay” is a
middling canvas wherein the distance lends dis-
enchantment to the view. In his portrait, “A Ray
of Sunlight,” J. Ward Symons makes an affectation
of crudity. A. E. Newbury is an improving per-
former, and W. Frater supplies some conscientious
diagrams of the human dial. Miss Teague is most
astonishing in her titles, one of which—it belongs
to a face bent ever a book —is “Russian Fairy Tales
by the Blue Sea Ocean.” The only miniaturist is
Miss Bernice Edwell, whose seven portraits are
charming.
AT SYDNEY PALACE.
Gaston Mervale, producer, and Maurice
Dudley, stage-manager, of “Turn to the
Right."
“The Waybacks” crowded Adelaide King's
for a week before moving on to Broken Hill.
William Stewart can fairly be ranked with
Bert Bailey as a “Dad,” and in a clever
crowd Cleave McGrath is striking as Jabez,
while the others exaggerate almost brilli-
antly. Variety from the Majestic has moved
bodily into the King’s, while the larger
house takes in the Bunyip panto. Still
another Australianism is a version of the
Kelly romance at the Tivoli, chiefly notable
for the good work of Cross as Dan Kelly
and for letting Fitzherbert for once play a
part that is not villainous. At the Royal,
“The Pink Lady” is the most joyous frivol-
ity seen since “High Jinks.” It had a
strong French plot before its music was
thought of, and the lyrics of “Belle of
New York” McLellan give an audience the
unusual experience of trying not to miss any
of the words. Minnie Love rises to a big
chance, Roberts sings well, and Leslie Hol-
land, Florence Young and Celia Ghiloni
make every line of their small parts tell.
And the day-dream of the Saskatchewan girl
is about the most daintily pathetic thing
seen in a play of this class. Birthday Cup
week crowds take joyfully to all these offer-
ings and also to many picture-shows. Pav. has
a really exciting motor smash ; West’s actu-
ally star a man (Robert Harron) instead
of a lady, and Wondergraph has to hire the
Exhibition to hold the overflow from “Snow
White,” with Marguerite Clark as>the mag-
net.
AT POVERTY POINT.
Like his brother Jean, Edouard de Reszke,
the favorite operatic bass of the ’Bo’s and
’9os, made a fortune with his voice. Edouard
had the ill-luck to be living in his home in
native Poland when the Huns devastated
the country, and his possessions went the
way to be expected when the German hogs
root. He is said to have died destitute,
notwithstanding the efforts of brother
Jean, who lives in Paris. Edouard had
great enthusiasm for his work and was at
home in French, Italian and German opera.
His magnificent rendering of Wagnerian
parts ought to have brought immunity to
him from Teuton ruthlessness. He was
many times in the same cast as Melba, and
was 61 when his end came the other day.
“J.F.H.”: Genevieve AVard, still a lead-
ing member of Sir George Alexander’s Go.
at the St. James’s, London, is just about to
enter on her eighties, and a book of her
reminiscences is announced for early publi-
cation. No doubt it will have a chapter on
her famous farewell to Australia in the
Melbourne Town Hall, transformed for the
occasion into a theatre, which produced
some £3OOO odd and materialised in the
Genevieve Ward Wing of the Melbourne
Women’s Hospital. Genevieve has been a
diligent diarist throughout her long life and
has filled 40 manuscript volumes in this
way. All these she has handed over to
Richard Whiteing, long of the Daily News,
who is building up a book on this very sub-
stantial foundation, with supplementary
stories from “Genny’s” well-stored and reten-
tive memory.
A deputation from the Limelight Associa-
tion called on N.S.AV. Acting-Premier Fuller
last week and asked that managers of tour-
ing cos. be compelled to lodge a deposit equal
to two weeks’ salary for every member of
the co. Fuller deferred his reply. If he
can’t recommend the money-deposit system
he might at least decree that every Silver
King and Lady Macbeth be supplied with a
pair of sound boots and a road map.
“0.K.”: Why the railings against “The
Marriage of Kitty” as though it were being
offered as a play to be taken seriously?
“Kitty” is a farcical drawing-room comedy,
originally intended to be rattled through in
two hours, and preceded by a curtain-raiser.
It is an admirable thing of its kind. “R”
(B. 24/5/’l7) complains of loose construc-
tion, and says that “the juvenile and the
lawyer tell each other all the things they
knew before.” Not at all. The “juvenile,”
a gentlemanly ass-about-town, is seeing his
lawyer for the first time since the death of
an uncle who has left him a fortune under
certain conditions. Previously he had been
of precious little importance to the lawyer.
AVhy should this legal person be assumed to
know all about the odd clause in uncle’s
will? Seems to me the comedy is being
blamed for the sins of the performance. This
is out of balance. The two ladies are respec-
tively too old and too young for their parts.
Moreover, the too-young actress is not equal
to her difficult task. A dozen years ago,
when the story was more naturally illus-
trated, the play was just as convincing as its
farcical plot would permit. But its atmo-
sphere was always foreign to Australia.
The particular brand of amiable ass who
falls victim to the Peruvian widow is
unknown here; consequently the widow her-
self is hard to believe in. But a first-class
actress would make her understood, and then
the comedy would be much more telling with
even an unsympathetic public. No public,
however, would think “Kitty” quite a full
evening’s entertainment.
“Norbell”: The stage-hands pronounce
Marie Tempest a good artist, but complain
that she needs a lot of waiting on. Special
dressing-room, carpets down everywhere,
absolute silence, no one allowed to breathe
on the stage except the performers, and so
on. Marie has a second scene set round the
one in use, with a row of electric radiators
in between, to give the tempest the correct
temperature, so to speak. She directs every-
thing herself, and on the day of opening
at Sydney Criterion she kept the stage
staff on the run from 10 a.m. till 5 p.m. on
one scene alone, adjusting the dressing,
lighting, etc., although the piece had just
been played in Melbourne. In a short skirt
and top boots, with a cigarette between her
teeth, Marie cut a more picturesque figure
than she does at night. She was on deck all
that first weary day at the Cri., which was
inconsiderate of her, for the hands were
aching to express their feelings, and they
couldn’t do it properly in the presence of a
lady.
“L.H.P.”: “First Old Man” (B. 24/5/T7)
is wrong when he say's that we have seen
nothing from the pen of 11. H. Davis since
1904. The Brougli-Flemming comedy com-
pany staged Davis’s amusing four-act
comedy, “Mrs. Gorringe’s Necklace,” at
Sydney Palace during the Easter of 1907.
The cast included Herbert Flemming, Edgar
Payne, Carter Pickford, Gregan McMahon,
Madeline Meredith, Bessie Major, Gordon
Lee and Beatrice Day. Other novelties of
that welcome season of comedy were
“Peter’s Mother,” “What Would a Gentle-
man Do?” and “Olivia,” the last a version
of “The Vicar of Wakefield,” by W. G.
Wills, and in England associated with Irving
and Ellen Terry.
“Jwosp”: Captain Jack Bonavita, who
was in Australia early in the century with
Bostock’s Circus, was killed in Los Angeles
recently while training animals for the
movies. Bonavita lost an arm in 1904
during an argument with a lion. This time
the other party was a Polar bear. The
trainer’s right name was John F. Gentner,
and his wife was a genuine princess from
Belgium.
“Stargazer”: “Three Twins,” the Firm’s
latest burst of hysterics set to music, came
to us unheralded and unsung. No previous
eruption of the kind was allowed to bring
itself off with so little preliminary sputter-
ing, and now it is here we recognise that
with the exception of two passable items
—or 2-J at the most —no conscientious
management could really find good words to
throw at it. And when a conscientious
management can’t do that the case is hard
indeed. Recognising the deficiencies of the
extravaganza, the Firm made an heroic
effort to recompense us for the scarcity of
material by a generous lack of clothes. One
yellow ballet may have something on, but
from my point of view, well up the circle, it
had contented itself with a coat of paint—
not a thick one, either, nor an all-over-coat.
That ballet should be christened “The Yellow
Peril.”
Much of the humor of ill-fated “London
Pride” lay in the dialogues between the bloke
and his gal. As, for instance, when she pro-
tests that Cufbert’s attentions to the other
gal make her larf. “Well, larf now,” says
the cheerful bloke. A woman is rarely more
riled that when she says the other woman’s
pretensions are amusing her.
The Southern Cross is the name of a new'
movie-production co. that has its studio in
the clear air of Adelaide, with John F.
Thiem as managing director. The pro-
gramme for the next 12 months includes
five five-reel dramas and three two-reel
comedies. The first of the batch, “The Black
Opal,” will be ready in about six weeks.
The co. imported W. M. Plank from the
U.S.A. to direct production, but the others
are all Australians with experience in the
shadow-manufacturing business.

George Langworthy Lethbridge, dead at
Singleton (N.S.W.), aged 90, was born at
Parramatta, where his father, Captain
Robert Lethbridge, R.N., had a grant of
land, given him for saving Governor
Bourke’s despatches when his ship was
burned at sea in 1821. In early days
George tailed his dad’s numerous cattle, and
in February, 1854, with two whites and two
abos., he went hunting for lost explorer
Leichhardt. They didn’t find Leichhardt,
but they discovered a lot of good country
:l t the head of Palm Creek and on the Daw-
s°n an( i Mackenzie rivers.
THE PIANO PLAYER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The people over opposite, just across the way,
Have got a new piano thing-, it came the other day,
And ever since it landed there, with neither stop nor
stay,
It’s been going- “Tinkle, tinkle, tinkle, turn, turn,
turn.”
“Tinkle, tinkle, tinkle,” in the morning when we
rise,
And “Tinkle, tinkle, tinkle,” when we try to shut
our eyes;
The melodies come streaming in like swarms of little
flies,
Singing “Tinkle, tinkle, tinkle, tinkle, turn, turn,
turn.”
“Tinkle, tinkle, tinkle,” till the John upon the beat
Makes a hoppy sort of progress down our music-
maddened street,
And the grocer and the baker and the boy who
brings the meat
Go stepping to the “Tinkle, tinkle, turn, turn, turn.”
“Tinkle, tinkle, tinkle”—oh, the bangs that make
you wink
Are the boarders fleeing madly out to drown them-
selves in drink;
And while we hover dubious on self-destruction’s
brink
It continues gaily strumming: “Tinkle, tink, tink,
tink.”
Yes, the tinkle, tinkle, tinkles through our fevered
slumbers drift,
And it’s tinkle, tinkle, tumming- when our weary
lids we lift;
How we crave the blessed mercy of a music-meeting
rift!
But still it tinkles, tinkles, so I—think—we’ll—
shift.

WINES
“Gunner” : It takes a lot to root out of
the swanking old British officer the idea that
the chief purpose of the soidier is to be
pretty. Atkins was over in London on fur-
lough showing his new friend Billjiua round,
when they met one of the old sort. He
pulled them up. “What’s this! What’s
this!” he barked, as he poked at Atkins’s
partly-unbuttoned tunic. "You're not fool-
ing round in France now, you know!”

“Pet”: A Sydney Judge lately remarked
that if the military people liked to accept a
garrotter, whom he was sentencing, lie would
raise no objections. Perhaps if that Judge
were a soldier instead he would raise many
objections. A criminal is taken on the

I’ll fog you!”
strength among a lot of “white” chaps.
Being cunning he behaves himself for awhile ;
but as soon as he gets oversea—and by that
time he has probably demoralised a
the younger lads—he drops the mask. The
battalion may be billeted near a town, and
(say) .10 per cent, of the men are given
leave in turn. The criminal won’t wait for
his turn; he sneaks out and plays up.
Next day lI.Q. gets a complaint from
the provost-marshal, and the battalion's
leave is stopped. In billets, farmers' pro-
perty is damaged, and the whole crowd has
to pay through the battalion canteen fund.
On the march the waster drops out, hangs
in the rear, and knocks up every house
where he thinks he can cadge or bluff any-
thing. Result—a bad name for the bat-
talion among the civilian inhabitants. The
common idea that the criminal makes a
good soldier is rubbish. You can’t get him
into the trenches; he would rather go to
gaol than take the job on. Of course, I'm
speaking of the real bad egg. not of the
generally-decent chap who occasionally gets
too much liquor and smashes some of the
military regulations while his head is muzzy.
Corporal Ben told the story when they
reached the lines again :
“There was 19 of us choked in a hole where a
shell had tore the stuffin’ out of half the town. AA’e
had 15 rifles among us, a fair go of ammunition, and
a sausage chopper, a clinkin’ little machine it was.
AVe had that hole and a pretty bit of shooting between
us and hell, and we was there to stay maybe a day,
maybe seven, p’raps till the end of everything.
“AA’e’d got shot off from the push in a blindin’
rough-up, and now the Huns was sittin' round us,
waitin’ for breakfast. AA’e was the breakfast. Some
of ’em didn’t live the day out. Next day we got
a tidy crop. 'Twould have been better than duck-
shootin’ if we’d had a bag of san’wiches with us, an’
a bottle.
“Third day finds us still leatherin’ it into the
enemy, a curtain of fire droppin’ one side to block
the Germans from sendin’ a batch to finish us.
another sheet of blazin’ iron droppin' on the other
side to prevent ours throwin’ forward a lot to mop
up the blighters who were layin’ for us. AA'e got
hungry. AA’e got thirsty. 1 didn’t believe a man
could get so thirsty. It set me suckin’ solid brick
in the hope of gettin’ somethin’ wet out of it. AVe
hung out till we felt we’d got to get up an' chance
being plastered with lead.
"AA'e was bracin’ up for the run, and the best: we
hoped for was a easy death —easier, anyhow, than
dyin’ of thirst —when down comes a little tubby ’and
grenade among us, killin’ poor English an’ doin’ in
Cameron’s leg. AA’e’re rubbing our eyes and sneezin'
the dust up when Andy fetches a yell. ‘Look ! Look !
Gorstruth, look !’ AA’e looked all right. That grenade
had lifted away a drayload of rubbish, and there,
stickin' out of the side of our hole, was a little, fat
barrel, and runnin’ from the barrel was a trickle of
somethin’ wet. Back of that beer was more beer—
and bacon !
“AA’e’d been down among the ruins of a pub all
the time!”
Billjim, prisoner of war in Germany, writ-
ing home to his people at Burwood (N.S.W.).
told them in a letter just received to save
any stamps there might be on his envelopes
until his return. To meet this strange re-
quest the stamp from his dilapidated envel-
ope was removed. Then was bared the stag-
gering message: "Tongue cut out!” It seems
incredible; but until the horrible suspicion
is set at rest there will be one more Aus-
tralian family tormented with anxiety.
C o m m o nwealth Statistician
Knibbs supplied some surprising
figures to the Sydney Child Wel-
fare Conference. In Australia, if
the average death-rate for the first
day after birth were maintained,
there would be no kiddies left after
106 days. In all other countries,
unless perhaps Maoriland. a shorter
period would make corpses of them
all. However, the rate falls off
rapidly for the first week; then
more shiwly till the twelfth year.
Bv that time it is only 1-3400th of
what it was on the first day.
Then it begins to increase again.
Australia’s mortality for the first
year has been falling for the last
30 years. Knibbs suggests that as
the first year is so fatal the end of
that period might well be taken as
the datum peg for measuring the
effective birth rate ; i.e., instead of
counting all children born, only the
first year’s survivors might be
reckoned. Australia’s survivors
are now 03 per cent, of births, as
against Chile’s 68 per cent. Con-
genital debility and malformation
are the young immigrants’ most
frequent enemies—a fact which
some good folk who reckon that
venereal disease is “punishment
for sin” might paste in their hats.
Also, having discovered what “sin” the poor
little immigrants have committed, they
might paste that, in their hats, too.
“Bad Bill” drops into a pub in Pimlico:
In the evening the “boozers” are open from half-
past six until half-past nine, and most of the cus-
tomers who shoulder through the door in the dark
street are women. The alleged Saloon Bar is a
small room about 12 x 8, and when we manage to
see through the smoke we note that seats are pro-
vided around the wall. The women are Jhree times
as numerous as the men, who are soldiers, war-
workers and old chaps past active service. The
women are the wives and daughters of soldiers at
the Front and of other people who live in the neigh-
borhood. “Treating” is not allowed, so the ladies

personally “breast the cedar” and order their half
o’ gin or half o’ mild and bitter. “Half o' gin”
means a half-quartern of gin, “half o’ mild and
bitter” is a half-pint of mild and bitter ales mixed.
Other drinks unfamiliar to the Australian are Sloe
Gin, Four Ales, Six Ales, Burton (ale) and Reid's
(stout). See the old man come in with wife and
daughter. Dad has a half o’ Scotch, mother half o’
gin, aid daughter half o’ stout. Notice how mother
slips the money for his drink into dad’s hand,
because there’s a fine of £lOO and six months’
imprisonment for buying another person’s drink.
Just before 9.30 the boss calls, “Time, ladies and
gentlemen, please,” and there’s a scramble for the
final drink. Wait outside for awhile and probably
a Tommy and a few of the ladies will sing the
choruses of a few favorite songs before they fade
away into the night. Very friendly and cheerful,

of it or go home humming:

And I were the only boy.”

“The Office Curate”: I don’t think it is
generally known that no clergyman of the
Church of England ordained in Australia is
eligible for any ecclesiastical appointment
in the Motherland. But so it is enacted by
the Colonial Clergy Act, passed many years
ago by the British Parliament and still in
operation. In certain exceptional cases the
Archbishops of Canterbury and York may
grant a temporary license to an Australian-
ordained clergyman to work in England;
but as long as he holds it he must pay a
prescribed fine as a sort of confession of his
inferiority to the pure merinoes of English
flocks. This Act was openly and avowedly
framed and passed in order to “guard against
inferior moral and intellectual standards”
being imported into the ranks of the “Home”
clergy of the Church of England. The London
Guardian, the leading organ of the Church,
gives prominence to a demand for its imme-
diate repeal as a “very necessary reform.”
It adds the interesting information that it
knows “colonially-ordained clergymen” who
have “successfully dodged” the Act. and are
now holding lucrative ecclesiastical appoint-
ments in England. But it doesn’t explain
how the dodge has been worked.
“Peru”: The briefest revolution I ever
attended was a Brazilian naval burst at Rio
20 years ago. The crew of an imposing
Brazilian warship lying in Rio Harbor got
annoyed about something, sent the officers
away in small boats, trained the guns on the
city and let fly. The result astonished
everybody—the mutineers especially. The
shells flew high over the city and exploded
harmlessly on the hills above the town just
as the ironclad started to sink at her moor-
ings. She had lain there so long, un-
attended to, that the vibration opened
enough plates to admit the whole Pacific.
Down she went, and the revolution was
over. The mutineers were rescued in small
craft from the steamers at anchor near by.

“A surprising number of young Australians volun-

Billjim, who one time scoured the AA’estern plain
And rode the reckless outlaw’ “ ’ell for leather,”
Has dropped for good his saddle gear and rein
And slung his old ambitions altogether.
Now with a soaring impulse in his breast
To “do his bit” and please his country’s eye,
He drives his latest mount at France’s sky
And shows that he can “fly it” with the best.
Just as in AA’estern scrubs in years ago
AA’e saw his nag beneath him, long and limber,
Dash through the mulga or the gidya low,
As though ’twas bulrush brake instead of timber,
To-day he sends his ’plane with outlook wider
AVith many a blanky o’er the Hunnish line,
And vows some day he’ll drop along the Rhine
And teach old Fritz the language of the Gwvdir.
The lad’s our own. lie comes of that great breed
That always soared beyond the wildest guesses;
That showed itself of Britain’s noblest seed;
That braved the wastes and tamed the wilder-
nesses.
A thousand dear ones with the cue who bore him
AA’atch with the spirit’s eye his ev’ry flight,
And pray that, from the powers of Hell and Night,
The kindly angels keep a vigil o’er him.

CASTOR OIL, SALTS * DRUGS REPLACED
BY CALIFORNIA SYRUP OF FIGS.
Delicious fruit laxative cleanses
stomach, liver and bowels of
old and young folks.
A delicious remedy for constipation,
biliousness, sick headache, disordered stom-
ach, indigestion, coated tongue, sallowness —
take California Syrup of Figs—“Califig."
For the cause of all this distress lies in a
torpid liver and sluggish bowels.
A tablespoonful to-night means all con-
stipation poison, waste matter, fermenting
food and bile gently moved out of your sys-
tem by morning without griping. Please
don't think of California Syrup of Figs—
“Califig”—as a physic. Don’t think you
are drugging yourself or your children. This
delicious fruit laxative cannot cause injury.
Even a delicate child can take it as safely
as a robust man. It is the most harmless,
effective stomach, liver and bowel regulator
and tonic ever devised.
Ask your chemist for a bottle of “Califig”
—California Syrup of Figs, which has full
directions for babies, children of all ages and
for grown-ups plainly printed on the bottle.
Get the genuine, made by California E’ig
Syrup Company. Refuse any -other kind
with contempt. “Califig”—California Syrup
of Figs—is sold by all chemists in bottles of
two sizes, Is. IRI. and Is. ltd. [3

Private Enterprise. Clarence Roy Beaugie-
liole, 21, arrived at Castlemaine (Vic.)
about four months ago, having been rounded
up under the Indeterminate Sentences
Act on a series of charges of robbery and
house-breaking. Presently he got tired of
the reformatory and vanished like the morn-
ing mist. He had found his first oppor-
tunity. Exactly a month later his luck gave
out and lie was collected and audited by the
Law. This is how he panned out: —
£l7 in sovs. and half-sovs., £8 in notes, £l7 4s.
in silver and 4*d. in copper; lady’s gold fob chain,
safetv-razor outfit, hand mirror, metal tube contain-

two woollen scarves, three razors, attache bag, book

Law is going to do with this brilliant
hustler? It is going to let him waste in

blue mould !
“Grus” : The Commonwealth has miles of
khaki cloth stored away. Why, then, don’t
they send reinforcements to keep Billjim
decently clad in France and England? A
young artillery Billjim I know, after seven
months’ fighting, was sent to England suffer-
ing from shell-shock. When he came out of
hospital he had only the same clothes he’d
arrived in—ragged shirt, breeches (torn)
and boots. Of course he couldn’t appear at
the dear Duchess’s garden-party like that.
So he fitted himself out in made-to-order
khaki and leggings complete, and then was
accosted by a staff-officer and threatened
with various punishments for appearing in
the street without full uniform ! While at
the tailor’s he’d neglected to buy himself
spurs!

There was some sweetly feminine reason-
ing at Melbourne Town Hall the other day
when superior womankind met together to
arrange details of the forthcoming Thrift
campaign. A lady with a good Scotch name
remarked that morning and afternoon toast
at fashionable tea-rooms was a waste of
money, seeing that the cusCiiMii6Jr» were in
no need of the extra nourishment, ftSd could
get it at home for a tenth of the money,
anyhow. The meeting wreathed itself ia
smiles. The idea of Thrift encroaching
upon the afternoon-tea habit was quite too
funny! Several spokeswomen were pre-
pared to defend it with the last man's last
shilling, and all were agreed that it “would
be wrong to interfere with anybody’s means
of livelihood.” That settled the question.
Half a dozen fashionable tea-shops live on

likewise sternly prohibit me from
purchasing tea for Pearl. I’m
worried about Pearl —I’m sure
she consumes too much tea.
My medical literature informs me
of the dreadful consequences of
excessive tea-dramming, especi-
ally on the female machinery,
and for a long time I’ve secretly
suspected myself of being a de-
scendant of the Borgias each
time I “shouted” the poison for
Pearl. Yet what can I do?
I can bluff Bill when he
wants beer; but when
Pearl requires tea I’ve got
to throw my hand in. Not.
of course, that Pearl asks
me to “shout” tea, but I
know she expects me to and
will think me a mingy
thing if I don’t. It’s the
custom for a gent, to shout
tea for a lady friend when
he meets her on the Block
in the afternoon (I’m con-
tinually meeting Pearl on
the Block in the after-
noon), and the iniquitous
custom is making me the
unwilling strafer of Pearl s ner-
vous system. Let the Law abol-
ish the custom —during the war,
anyhow. I suppose Pearl won’t
like her gratuitous tea cut off,
any more than Rill will welcome
the stoppage of his free beer,
but that can’t be helped. For the sake of
the Empire we just must save the people
from themselves and the mistaken generosity
of their friends.
From Adelaide Advertiser (25/5/’l7) :
Professional Gentleman (country), wishing

able. —“Forgiving, this office.
Hooray! Faith. Hope and Charity haven’t
gone out of business yet.
“Alfonso”: In some country places Bill-
jim is expected to kiss the entire female
population just before his train steams from
the platform. Re-
cently I saw one sol-
dier kiss 14 while the
train waited for him.
But some ignorant
townies don’t know the
war-time custom. A
fighting family were
giving a farewell party
to some of their sol-
dier sons, and invited
two or three singers
from the nearest town
to make the meeting
merry. At the end of
the festivity the khaki
sons of the land com-
menced to embrace all
skirts present. One lad
progressing through
the flock encountered
a town beauty at the
end of the room, and,
before the abashed fe-
male could sidestep,
she found his head
thrust into her bosom
and his brawny arm
encircling her body.
The girl hung back
blushingly, and the
s urprised soldier
pushed his face closer
to hers encouragingly.
Then, as she still hung back, in the politest
bewilderment he gasped: “Ain’t you <>ohi'
to?”
“Sarto”: The dashed eats want their
mice plague served with sauce now! After
a few days’ gorging our tabbies wouldn’t
look at the things. Then one morning I
found two drowned in my cream basin. I
gave one each to the go-slow cats. Next
morning I was awakened by a loud meow-
ing at the door. Got up, and there they
were with a mouse each, demanding more
cream-dressing!
“Fax”: Under Hennessy’s sway the
patriotic funds business is running on pain-
fully snobbish lines in Melbourne. During
last month, for instance, all collecting for
Australian patriotic causes was officially
deprecated on account of Lady Stanley hav-
ing earmarked the whole of May for British
Red Cross purposes. No august patronage,
mayoral or otherwise, was available for any
war cause save that which the State Gov-
ernor’s lady was featuring. Ada Reeve’s
proposal to organise a matinee performance
in aid of the Anzac Buffet in London was,
for instance, tabooed because she wanted it
HIE FIRST APPEARANCE.
“You aren't yoin' to wash me, are you?”
last month; it is to her credit that she
pluckily persisted in starting a big fund by
her personal exertions. The Mayor carried
Lady Stanley’s British Red Cross appeal
even beyond the limits of the mournful
month. The Town Hall was given up to a
grand spectacular fair beginning on the first
of June, and one of the many duties imposed
on “Sir David’’ by the war was the grant-
ing of his valuable assistance in being pre-
sent. It is on account of his intimate know-
ledge of this sort of flummery that a num-
ber of brother councillors who share his
devotion to vice-royalty are disposed to make
him Gaud Mayor for ever. Well, why not?
In a multitude of Melbourne City Council-
lors there is no better wisdom than
Hennessy’s.
“8.D.5.”: The Anzacs and Scottish regi-
ments are great pals. All our ranks seem
to get on better with the men who helped
them out at Bullecourt than with English
Tommies. The other day at Eta pies there
was a cinema exhibition of the Somme
films. No picture of the Australians or
"Jocks” was shown. A Tommy in the
audience, fired with enthusiasm, called
out: “Where are the Scotties and Aus-
tralians now, eh?” Like a shot the reply
came from a kiltie: “Up i’ the front
trenches keeping the Gain-mans back while
ye —s are getting yeer photos takken !”
Some 30 truckloads of Australian pota-
toes outdid the late Columbus last week and
discovered Chicago, where they got them-
selves sold successfully. And while Aus-
tralia is pouring potatoes into Uncle Sam’s
market. England has been pulling up the
rosebushes and p’anting 500.000 new veg-
etable gardens. The war, which has been
variously described as one of “gun-power,”
“man-power,” “attrition” and “exhaustion,”
is now a world-conflict of spuds, the nation
with the last spud to be declared the winner.
■**•*■*■
“Snell”: The war has certainly brought
about a great change in the outward seem-
ing of theatre audiences in Melbourne.
People are not only not “dressing” ; they are
exercising some skill in assuming as depress-
ing an exterior as possible. On first nights,
when formerly beauty hung out its banners
and bloomed up through its clothes like a
pink, pink rose, the interior now looks like
a morbid gathering of ancient Quakers tor-
mented with mumps, and gathered together
to repent the little pale errors of their ways.
However, all this drabness does not prevent
circle and stalls enjoying gaudy tommy-rot
with the same oicl infantile glee. I am re-
minded of my swell friend Kay, who went to
a banquet on the second night after his wife’s
funeral, but consoled himself by going in a
bad hat.
“Retinal”: Let me pass you a helping of
the uncanny. I was working my passage
from London to Australia on s.s. Pericles in
1010, the year she was lost off Cape Leeu-
win. When we had passed Teneriffe a
stewards’ concert was held in the “glory
hole,” the harmony of which was somewhat
broken by the continual repetition of “I tell
you the ship is going down on the way
home.” This came from another passage-
worker, who had the option of doing the
BOOTS AND THE MAN.
HE: “We’ve barely ten minutes to catch the
ferry.”
SHE ( cheerfully): “All right, just lace up
my boots while I slip on my frock.”
round trip. He was pooh-poohed, but his
persistence gave me a chill. A short time
after being paid off at Brisbane I was
brought up all-standing by black headlines:
“Loss of the Pericles.” She was replaced
by the old Norseman and maimed by the
crew of the Pericles, who had reached
London by various means. When she arrived
at Brisbane I went aboard to see the hands,
and asked for the prophet. “That !”
they said. “He decided to do the round trip,
but just before we left Melbourne he said to
us ‘Sink, you , sink/ and walked off,
leaving all his gear aboard.” The boat never
touched port again.
PIRATES.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The sea was a clean sea when I was a boy;
It was chock-full of hard-bitten pirates who drank
lied rum from their puncheons, and life was a joy
To even the victims who walked down the plank.
There were bands on the poop
Playing dare-devil tunes,
And dagoes, and daggers, and golden doubloons.
With the crossbones and skull flying free on our
truck,
And a buccaneer crew hauling hard on the brails,
We swept down the trade-routes in search of our
luck,
Scouting all the wide sea for fat merchantmen’s sails.
Then for brass gun and cutlass—
Hold hard, you old wreck!
Do you want your throats slit on your holystoned
deck ?
What ho for the nights in the Spanish Azores '
With the ship anchored tight with her hooks in
the mud,
And loot from the Indies and golden moidores
Helping rum from Jamaica put fire in our blood!
What ho for a hornpipe!
The revels begin!
But it’s cutlass or heels if a frigate pops in.
Our flag it was black, but our hearts they were
white;
We looted the spoil of the rich Dons of Spain ;
But it wasn’t the kudos so much as the fight
That sent the red blood flowing fresh through the
brain.
We sank the big galleon
Bight there in the bay,
But we treated the women in story-book way.
The sea was a clean sea when I was a boy—
I’ll warrant it isn’t the same for my son.
The slimy sea-viper he has for a toy
Makes meat of its prey without firing a gun.
There are women and children
And dead men galore
Floating round in the bath on the nursery floor.

Those who knew the Lite Kate Kelly, sis-

would have had her memory recalled by
reading a recent casualty list: It contained
the name of her son. killed in action. W hen
Kate left the scenes of her stirring youth,
she settled down with her husband in a
quiet western N. S. Wales town, where she
died in melancholy circumstances. Of her
three children, the boy has made the last
great sacrifice, and the husband of each of
the two daughters is on active service.
Judge Backhouse, of N. S. Wales District
Court, scored a very popular 66 not out last
week. He is one of the fairest men work-
ing under a wig to-day. Some months ago
an embezzler and admitted liar pleaded as
bis only excuse for stealing that he . had
taken the money to go surety for a friend.
Before passing sentence Backhouse asked tor
particulars; but the man in the dock
wouldn’t give them in open court. Another
Judge might have swept the excuse impati-
ently aside; Backhouse, looking over his
glasses, said : “If you wall write it and send

Every city has its chronic litigant with a
passion for going to law and conducting the
case without legal assistance. 0. C. Belcher
is Adelaide’s Exhibit A, and he took advan-
tage of the High Court’s visit to spread
himself. Barton, Duffy, Rich, Powers and
Isaacs had to sit for nearly an hour hearing
him explain that a local court had given
him only £l5 (and without costs) on a
claim lie made for £45, that the Supreme
Court had declined to give him leave to
appeal, and that now he wanted a rule nisi.
The brilliant Bench showed great patience,
but at last the Acting-C. J. had to tell him it
was “sheer waste of time.” Then he fired a
second barrel, but that was blank cartridge,
too. “Even more absurd than the previous
motion,” said the courteous Barton finally.
But Belcher had had a happy morning.
Mrs. Mary Lingham, who died the other

In the heart of Melbourne or thereabouts she
lived 76 years. She saw the city evolve from
a crude village, and for nearly <0 yeais she
had no illness to speak of. Her only surviv-

“Penwiper” : “How do you like the situa-

a grey 7 man with a fine forehead, deep-set
eyes, and great lower jaw. “I am hopeful, ’
he said. “Russia needs time .to reorganise,
and it will take eight months. Then she
will come in—with a smashing blow. You
know,” said he, “there was the attempt at a
revolution in 1825. The leaders were
arrested, among them a young man of -6.
He was mercifully spared death, and was
sent to Siberia. His fianede followed him.
In the mines they broke down the spirit of
him, quenched the fire of his ardor and wore
him down to an old man. When released
he no longer wanted to go back. He mar-
ried, and had children. The metal of the
fetters which he wore was made into a
locket containing his portrait at 20 and a
bit of the fetters in the rough. I have the
locket here in my pocket”—and he handed it
out. Then, after a pause: “I treasure it.
The man was my grandfather!”’
Died at Fremantle, aged 07, Lewis Wil-
liams, a pioneer Nor’-west pearler. Born at
Cadiz, in Spain, lie went as a lad
to Buenos Ayres, and arrived aboard
a whaler 51 years ago at Adelaide. Thence
he went to Fremantle and from there
followed the harpooning trade and the pearl-
ing. Striking it lucky he soon had a good-
sized fleet. For 40 years be was on the
coast between Sharks Bay and Derby, his
wife (nee Adams) being with him most of
the time. She was the first white woman to
land where’ Broome and Derby are now.
The adventurers put in one spell of three
years gathering turtles hell at Monte Bello
Island, off Onslow. In those days the Nor’-

but it suited the Williamses. They seemed
to have been born and mated especially to
tackle it.
Kitchener was quite misunderstood, says

The oldest unionist in Lithgow (N.S.M .)

preacher. It was the local-preacher part of
him that got him into politics—really as a
substitute for the local Methodist parson,
who was the chosen Labor candidate, but
fell sick just before the campaign started.

“Futsac”: I found the horsehair chair of
the late Viking Rawson in a Sydney picture
show lobby the other day. It supported a
cardboard figure of a Mormon performing a
marriage ceremony. Every time liis Ex.
mounted a public platform he used to insist
on the old horsehair relic being there to
receive him. It preceded him to functions
for five years, and must have covered 1000
miles of suburban roads per cart. The old
sailor’s fondness for the thing arose out of
his gout. It was the only chair he could
hoist himself out of without suffering liorri- .
bte spasms.
O’Malley, of the big hat and the kink, has
disappeared from Australian politics, lie is
going back to ’Murka. The Kink entered
the Reps, at the first Federal election
as one of the five members for Tasmania
when the State was polled as one electorate
under the proportional system. At the next
election he chose Darwin, and was opposed
by J. Brickhill, who ran him to a nose. He
has since been elected four times, winning
by nearly 2000 votes at the last election pre-
ceding his defeat. This time his opponent—
C. R. Howroyd—turned this majority into a
minority of 2600, but only lived three days
afterwards. O’Malley made his first
acquaintance with Australia as a canvasser
for the Equitable Insurance Co. In those
days his political talk was about women’s
rights (and wrongs), and he pushed into the
S. Aus. Assembly in opposition to a well-
known member who had got S. Australia’s
immensely powerful Methodist conscience
frowning at him. The Kink wasn’t a Labor-
ite in those days.
Mrs. Pember Reeves, whose husband was

One of these days we may have to form
a trades union for politicians. Considering
their average mentality, M’s.P. are not
underpaid, but there are times when they
are overworked. Lately the pace has been
killing, and the casualties heavy. Address-
ing several meetings daily throughout the
Conscription fight was too much for Frank
Brennan; his voice gave out and he has
been under a. doctor in Melbourne ever since.
Both Hughes and Hampson knocked up at
one stage of the Bendigo scrap, and neither
has yet recovered. Carty Salmon became
ill while contesting Grampians; Findley and
Blakey were very sick men before the
Senate campaign was over; and Howroyd
died immediately after he had uppercut Kink
O’Malley at Darwin.

Senate will be Keating of the Speck.

Some twenty words the doctor spoke. . ■ •
And o’er the range of Sleepless Pain niv lonesome
way I broke.
“I won out to the shaded green
Where cooling rivers ran,
And in the waters washed me clean —
I stood a wholesome man.
I took again my smiling bride;
No more my tingling nose astride
The little crimson devils ride.
But still the flagon beckons me—
The flagon round the corner that no other eye may
see.
“In fireside glow when Winter drips
And Merry sings her song,
1 dream of little whisky nips
A bare two inches long;
Of little whiskies two by two
That slide across the nearer view,
With seething soda beaded through ;
My babe is kicking in his car
Oh ! fair the suave and plump full curves of whisky
bottles are!
■ “I go where many friends are met,
In mail of heart-strings knit,
And see the fat decanter set,
And shake my head at it.
I shake my solemn head, but, oh !
I hear .the glug, I see the flow,
And when the night is gone I know
What each has drunk. In sober play
I’ve followed every gulp down every inch of all the
way 1
“There Beauty is with jewelled eyes;
Here fleet young dancers cofne.
How lovely are the lights that rise
In crystal cups of rum !
Lo, grace and melody combine 1
The purr of brandy is divine,
And frolic forms in beaded wine.
No magic in Greek marble basks
Like portly grace of puncheons and of little, swelling
casks.
“Sleek bottles in dim cupboards hid
I feel in all my bones;
I hear the lisp of barrels mid
Lank cobwebs ’neath the stones;
Brown jugs in bars cry after me,
And naked beer like one vast sea
Foams down the street, and fearfully
I slink like one who hears the dead 1 —
In storm and fire let Europe crack, I have my war!”
he said.
VICTORIA.

The half-year’s profit is the largest ever dis-
closed by this bank, and is just over
£lOO,OOO in excess of that for the half-year
to March, 1910. Certainly there has been
some increase of capital since then, but not
nearly enough to account for an increased
profit at the rate of over £200,000 a year.
Further, unless this bank has forsaken its
olden ways, it .has put something substantial
aside to provide for contingencies. Assum-
ing that that has been done, the net profit
shown is an astonishingly splendid perform-
ance. It may be a bit too splendid. The
Wales can say that it has no monopoly
whatever—that there are a dozen other
banks to which the public may turn. It
is quite true, but that in such circumstances
it can make, after paying its taxes, etc.,
nearly GO p.c. more than it made seven
years ago, merely shows how general is the
disease from which we are suffering—this
disease which is driving us to grab a bit
out of the war. We can only be sure of
this: either we are making Britain and
the Allies provide these extra profits now
or we shall have to pay them ourselves later
on. Perhaps some of both. For the
apparent local prosperity which is not due
to the sale of wool, copper, etc., at war-
famine prices to Britain and the Allies is
due to the borrowing and lavish spending
of war loans by ourselves. In neither case
are the big profits anything to feel glad
about.
The worst of it is that unquestionably
abnormal profits have a serious effect on
recruiting and on those already recruited.
The effect upon the already recruited is apt
to be overlooked; but every now and then,
in a sharp growl from the Front, we get a
hint of the effect of high.prices and abnormal
profits upon the man in the trenches. Of
course these things are not talked about.
Well schooled by the censorship—in its early
days especially—the newspapers print only
one kind of story from the battlefield. But
there is another kind—the kind that
shows be'tter what is in the minds of
the men. This paper can’t say more than
this: that if we want to push this war to
the very end—to the uttermost defeat of
trie enemy—we must keep the men at the
Front well content to remain there, and satis-
fied that the war is not being used to exploit
those they have left behind or for profit-
making purposes. In the early -days
of the fighting trading and financial
cos. were, as a rule, ashamed to
show increased profits. Under one dis-
guise or another they hid them or
apologised for them. To-day they don’t do
either. Yet abnormal profits are really a
far more serious matter to-day than they
were in the early days of the war. The
men at the Front are very human. They
have been fighting, some of them, for nearly
three years—a terrific three years. Of
course they are thoroughly tired of it, as a
rule. This is no less true of the English
troops than of the Australian —and cer-
tainly of the German, as well. Naturally, then,
they are more disposed to feel themselves
wronged or injured; and big wartime profits,
which probably wouldn’t have had any atten-
tion at all at one time, are now indubitably
regarded as a grievance. This is one reason
why. if there is going to be a Wartime
Profits Tax, it ought to be announced
promptly. Then at least the men at the
Front, who have lots of time to think, and
lots of time to exchange views and swop
grievances, would know that more or less of
every co.’s excess profit would be snipped off
and dropped, after all. into the proper
pocket.
Going back to the March prior to the war,
we get these B.N.S.W. comparisons:—

Deposits are £3,475,000 higher than they
were three years ago; and a comparison of
quarterly averages shows that all or practi-
cally all of it is on current account. This
is money left for the most part for safe
custody, pending investment: and it ought
to be'doing something better for the country.
True, the Wales, having been in a very
strong position before, has been able to take
the risk and increase its own investments
(mostly war loan) by over £4,000,000. But,
honestly, war-loan investment is not the
business of banks at all, except so far as
their own reserves are concerned. They
have been expected to do altogether too much
to help war loans through, and have been
reproached altogether undeservedly.
This was the centennial meeting of the
bank. A few years ago it was suggested
that the shareholders should celebrate it by
telling one another what fine fellows they
are in new premises. But the war finally
killed that idea. Still the new building is
to arrive some day ; and in preparation for
it premises behind the present bank were
bought a while ago to house the staff and
the overdrafts while the new George street
front is going up. To go on with the staff
has just got a bonus of £40,000 —which,
by the way, is also the .amount of since-the-
war taxes paid by the bank last year in
England and Australia. Lucky bank that
can do it and still show the glittering profit
mentioned in the table!

* Including amount transferred to Contingency
account.
During the past year a contingency fund of
£18,378 has been established, £11,133 by an
appropriation in the first and £7245 in the
second half. So far, these amounts have been
reckoned in the table as profits; but they
may have to be cut out later on to pay war-
tax. The politicians’ protracted backing and
filling over this question of war-tax is em-
barrassing and very unfair. Until it is
known definitely whether the tax is to be
made retrospective the disclosed profits of
companies are purely tentative ; yet the price
of shares is liable to be fixed by investors on
the published figures. Further, until manage-
ments know what back money they have to
pay up in hard cash, they are bound to
restrict both their enterprise and the assist-
ance they give to war loans.
The war has given Australia a Protection
which the politicians have denied her, and
there is great industrial activity in conse-
quence. On top of that there is the lavish
expenditure of borrowed money. Prices have
therefore soared; and trading profits being
large, advertising has been brisk. Hence this
co. has been able to maintain its profits in
spite of the fact that there are very few in-
dustries in which costs show a greater in-
crease since the war started than newspaper
production. Paper, the largest item in a
newspaper’s cost-sheet, runs to, roughly,
three times as much as it did in the early
part of 1914. English supplies of paper and
paper pulp come mainly from Scandinavia ;
and the track to Scandinavia is across the
North Sea. Apart from that, paper is bulky
freight; and there is not the shipping avail-
able for anything so inedible. Evidently
believing—on very good grounds—that the
chances of getting supplies will grow worse
instead of better, this co. has laid in large
stocks. This and other movements are
shown in the next table:—

1907. 1912. 1916. 1916. 1917

Liabilities '2,102 8,598 7,150 6,160 45,473
To finance the heavy holding of paper stock
and to help pay for its war-loan subscription
the co. has lately added £39,000 to its debts;
but in present circumstances paper is as
good as gold—better, perhaps.
Looking back over 10 years the co. can
reasonably shout itself three cheers. Taking
no account of machinery, it has in that time
added £38,000 to its freeholds (it has just
been providing itself with a bulk store) and
£47.000 to its very liquid assets; and the
increase in its liabilities is more than coun-
terbalanced by the increase in stock. Mean-
while it has called up no capital. There are
now 250,000 ordinary £1 shares and
125,000 prefs.; but £198,000 is represented
by goodwill, so that the first table shows
that £144,622 of the capital has still no
tangible assets supporting it.

It used to be “profit,” and now it is “net
profit” in that first column. The co. in its
early days had a lot of machinery which it
proceeded to scrap as soon as it found that
the paper was going to be a success; and
the directors wrote down the book value of
the junk whenever an opportunity offered.
The premiums on the various issues of shares
after the co. was launched disappeared in
that way. In addition to the sums thus
written off, £2OOO a year was mostly snipped
out of trading profits to cover current wear
and tear. That would make the net profit
for the year ended March, 1915, £10,836.
What has been written off since then is not
clear. In the year to March, 1916, the
Plant Reserve was not increased ; in the past
year it went up from £17,567 to £22,017, and
that looks as though £4450 .of gross profit
was set aside to provide for renewals by-and-
bye. Incidentally, there used to be a small
contingency fund, and this was in former
years reckoned with the reserves. But as it.
has now been split up, and the greater part
of it earmarked for income-tax, the additions
to this fund as they were made have been
deducted from profits.
All thing's considered, the co. has done
well during the past year—well to make a
profit of £13,959; very well to, as it seems,
make an additional £4450 which it has put
aside for plant renewals.' Of course, some-
thing substantial ought to be put aside.
Plant and machinery run to £69,350; and a
plant that has to do rush work is liable
to lose, all round, 7i p.c. of its value a year
—not because of wear and tear alone, but
because improvements are constantly being
made, and .much of the success of an after-
noon paper hangs on the speed with which
it can spring off the mark into the market
ahead of its loathsome competitor’. A few
other things count, of course—what it has
to spring off with, for example. The Sun
can’t be accused of niggardliness in that
respect. It has indeed such remarkably fine
goods in its cable columns that the morning
paper fetich is dying. If you want to sell a
man heavy stodge, the early morning before
he has the sleep rubbed out of his eyes is
the best time to do it. For that reason about
half the morning papers printed in English
(or thereabouts) would wilt inside 12
months if they offered themselves for sale
only after noon. Yet the morning paper has
been the necessity and the afternoon paper
the luxurv almost up to the present. The
Sun’s cables have been making a lot ‘of
people recast their views on that subject.
More of the progress made since this co.
took over the flickering little Star is shown
in this table:—

Cash, etc... 1,056 2,670 7,551 5,962 2,233
In view of the difficulties of getting paper
supplies a £27,910 stock seems small. Cer-
tainly the directors say that “satisfactory
contracts have been entered into for sup-
plies up to the end of 1918, so that no appre-
hension may be felt on this account for a
considerable period ahead” ; but in these days
it is one thing to make contracts and another
to get them fulfilled. A small increase has
been made in the capital during the year.
This was due to the issue of 21.000 shares on
which ss. has beeif paid. The so-called
6 p.c. dividend for the second half of
the year is really something a trifle better,
because the same 7 l-sd. has been handed
over whether the shares were paid to 20s. or
ss.

hatched in the nest of the Chamber of Manu-
factures, and that motherly fowl gets a peck
at the profits. Her share is £l5O for the
past year. For the rest the shareholders —
apparently all of them manufacturers—get
10 p.c. on their capital; and after contin-
gencies have been provided for the policy-
holders are entitled to the balance by way of
bonus. So the manufacturers have provided
themselves with cost-price insurance; and
that means reduced manufacturing costs
without cutting the pay of the worker.
The capital put up only amounts to £2060,
and thus far, in three years, £525 has been
paid in divs., £8(570 has been put by for the
protection of clients and £18,955 has been
returned to the co-operating policy-holders.
Or put it this way. To start the business,
the manufacturers put up £20(50. They have
got 10 p.c. on it each year, and seem likely
to go on getting that much. To this co.
consisting of themselves they have in the
three years paid in premiums £34,364.
Losses have called for £6632, exes, (includ-
ing taxation) £4X7(5; total £11.508. The
balance, £22.856, which is (57 p.c.. or just
over two-thirds, of the entire premiums, has
been available as surplus money to hand back
to the policy-holders or to safeguard future
transactions. Actually less than one-third of
the premium income has sufficed to pay-
losses and all exes. Here are the details
year by year:—
April, Premiums. Losses. Exes.
1915 .. £.6,854 £619 £857
1916 .. 11,023 2291 1635
1917 . . 10,487 3722 2384
As for the shareholders’ dividend; more than
enough is earned in interest to pay that.
And while getting a refund averaging for the
past year apparently 43 p.c. of their pre-
miums, policy-holders are amply protected :
for the co. on April 30 had £14,000 net of
cash and very liquid assets, and any losses
“in excess of the premium income in any
one year” are guaranteed up to £50,000 by
a British underwriting co.

This co. has suffered during the half-year
through (1) the general strike which was so
weakly ended with a bribe and (2) the prac-
tical extinction of Newcastle’s foreign coal
trade. Even without any such special handi-
caps the East Greta is a disappointment.
Stanford Merthyr is only one of the co.’s
three collieries—East Greta is the other one
of consequence—and the last official figures
showed 330 men employed underground
at that one property. Besides the
output of coal which this big force of
men represents, the co. has the revenue
from the East Greta railway. Last
year’s total receipts, from mines and rail-
way, were only a few score short of
£200,000: yet the so-called net profits were
under £l3.ooo—less than 61 p.c. on the out
put. And that wasn’t true net profit,
because part of the capital of the co. is
represented by coal that was dug out and
sold, wherefore part of the so-called profit
ought to be put aside in order to presently
repay capital. A co. so well situated and

Elbert Ilubbard correctly described the word
“failure” when he said “an opportunity to say. I told
you so.” There should be no opportunity for anyone
to say “I told you so” after you have chosen the
roofing for your homestead, dairy, barn or out-
houses. Choose a roofing that has been tried and its
success recognised—a roofing that will resist the ele-
ments—that will neither rot, rust, sweat, crumble or
pinhole—that will not affect drinking water, yet at
the same time be waterproof—that is cheap to buy,
cheap to freight and easily bandied. Adamax Roof-
ing answers these points most perfectly. The various
Governments of the Commonwealth have used
Adamax Roofing in large quantities with great
success. All interested in roofings now or in the
future should write for free booklet, “The Adamax

ised which left £31,250 to be paid up m
cas h bv shareholders. Outside the mines and

creased bv about £45,000; but liabilities aie

any capital as a set-off against the coal taken
out of the mines, the mines and railways have

The depreciation written off is £682 on plant,
£163 on leaseholds (that item thus dis-
appears) and £B4 on stock. Plant stands at
£14,183. Whether £682 is much or absurdly
little to write off depends entirely upon what
amount has been spent on replacements.
“Revaluation of plant and other assets, the
directors say. “wall be carried out during
the coming half-year, AA e- will then bring
forward a proposal for writing-down the
capital accordingly, and thereafter hope to
pav regular dividends.” The Bulletin
hopes so, too, but for the present it can t see
what they are to be paid out of. There wall
still be depreciation to provide for when the
breakables, etc., have been written down to
their proper value; and if only 10 p.c. p.a.
had been written oft: during the past three
years, the annual net loss would have been
about £3UO. There is no dividend in that.
Look at it another way:—

Liquid assets (including stock) . . 5,000 /,029
Excess liabilities .. •• £6,505 £6,952
The simple fact is that, though the co. has
not paid out a dividend during the past
three years, the whole of the alleged profit
and a trifle besides has been consumed by
the dragon called plant.
“Te Babarantiko” throws some light on
the C.S.R. Co.’s side-lines in Fiji:—
If you ask in Fiji who really rules the colony, most
will say: “The Company.” That means the C.S.R.
A minority will say: “Oh! the Government rules the
colony all right. It is always at loggerheads with
the Company and takes every opportunity to jump
on it. The Government is Boss.”
The Company runs the railways. In return for
this concession it carries mails, runs a passenger
“express” once a week from Ba, via Lautoka, to
Sigatoka, and sends a passenger train to Lautoka to
meet each Australian mailboat. The passenger train
is composed of a rake of flat cargo cars and a
rough-roofed tramcav with seats for white passengers.
This car lias chronic yearnings for a good clean-up.
Indian and Fijian passengers take their chances on
the bogeys, while the various shades with white
admixture crowd, diffidently, the ends of the passenger
car. The Company carries passengers free of charge,
but accepts no responsibility for accidents, for time
of starting, for starting at all —-or for anything.
Most of the telephone lines belong to the Company.
But it allows, through the Postal Authorities, public
use of the lines from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. daily, except
Saturday, when the offices close at 1 p.m.
When smaller private butchering concerns failed
the Company took to slaughtering ail meat within
its spheres of operations. The meat it sells to its
employees at fivepence per pound, which is cost
price, and to outsiders at sevenpence. It runs a
Rest House at Lautoka, at the rather high tariff
of seven shillings per day considering the accommo-
dation, and another at Nadarivatu, on the ranges,
where the temperature sometimes descends to near
freezing-point, and where strawberries grow.
And, on the whole, it manages to make ends meet.
With few exceptions the C.S.R. no longer works its
plantations in Fiji. Gradually the farms, as going
concerns, have been given over to overseers of
approved service, to be worked on a lease system
for what profit the lessee can make. The arrange-
ment seems to suit both parties. The lessee calls
himself planter instead- of overseer—a harmless
vanity, as he is almost as much under the co.’s con-
trol as when he worked on a salary. The “indepen-
dent” planter, owning or leasing his land from the
natives, is really in a more precarious position than
the overseer-lessee. The co.’s own man naturally
receives preferential treatment, and sometimes the
“independent” planter has to leave part of his cane
crop in the field. There can be no , lea ly J ca P ne
planter where there is but one buj e. of cd '
The plantation is taken over with tlo P> bul
stock, implement and laborers at vahiation the c •
reserving the right of resumption also at valuatiom
The lessee is allowed, say, £3OO toi the
expenditure. After the first crop he is ex P ected
be on his feet and make his expenses and profit from
the sale of cane. How the lessees really stand only
the company and themselves know.
This leasing of the plantations may not be due to
any special benevolence on the owner’s part, llathta
may it be the outcome of the farsightedness for
which the Company is noted. It has known (none
better) the pending change in coolie-labor conditions
and may have seen that it would be well for others
to battle with those conditions, with itself as paternal
sponsor, using its beneficent influence for its pro-
teges in quarters where influence will do most good.
The report of Atkinson, manager of Veg-
etable Creek (N.SAV.), presented at the
annual meeting in Sydney, read more like
a funeral oration than the usual Hallelujah
Chorus. Chandler’s shaft (whence came
the last four dividends) is gutted, bar three
months’ work; and Atkinson forecasts 12
lean months. Since this tin mine was taken
on terms from the Gordon brothers, the
shareholders have subscribed some £50,000,
and £150,000 has been -won from tin. The
shareholders have had about £28,000 back
in dividends, or a little more than half of
their capital. The Gordons have had close
on £30,000. Allow £lO,OOO for plant and
it leaves about £130,000 for wages, salaries
and incidentals. The Gordons’ property
cost close on £30,000, and it has produced
some £50,000 worth of‘ tin. After debiting
working expenses it has proved an unpay-
able proposition for the co. Chandler’s pro-
perty was bought by the former secretary
for £lOOO cash and £lOOO from tin won, and
it. has produced close on £lOO,OOO worth of
tin.
* * * *
“Quidam”: About as good a proposition
as is likely to be discovered for the all-
solution all-sluicing process is Sheehan’s
Junction Mine, near Mandurama (N.S.W.),
on the Belubula River. The ore, said to
be composed of volcanic ash, is easily reduced
and presents no material chemical diffi-
culties, while its highly-payable nature is
indisputably evidenced by the results
obtained by the present proprietors, working
in an easy-going manner with a couple of
Huntington mills. Tor unsuitable ores,
such, for instance, as the acid, copper-
impregnated gossan at the Mabel mine,
Wiseman’s Creek, where the all-solution busi-
ness was given a brief trial, crushing with
cyanide solution is hopeless; but on a
suitable ore, where, as at Sheehan’s, about
80 p.c. of the gold is obtainable by
cyanide, and there are no insuperable
chemical or mechanical obstacles, it is pre-
eminently economical and effective.
If shareholders of the New Langi
Logan (Vic.) fail to make a noise over the
bottling up of James Hebbard’s report they
are a soft lot. What has thus far been let
out is that extraction has to stop, pumping
has to be stuck to, seven months’ develop-
ment done, and 2s. 6d. called up. Roughly,
another £12,000 is to go into the mine out
of shareholders’ pockets, so that they will
have put up about £150,000 before things
can be shipshape enough to please Hebbard.
It isn’t clear whence all the optimism of
that expert comes. But the full text of the
report, when it is given out (if it ever is),
may make that clearer.

Golden Ridge (W.A.) announces that fur-
ther prospecting has failed to disclose any-
thing of value and that the co.’s searches
for a new property are still unsuccessful.
So the Board proposes to return to share-
holders a further 2s. per share of capital on
June 30. Apparently the co. is making pre-
parations to go out of business altogether.
* * * *
Golden Point’s illusions about the value
of its Westonia and Comet Vale shows are
not yet gone. Of the former the manager
states that its “success or otherwise” will
be determined within the next two months,
and of the latter that “nothing has occurred
to alter his opinion.” Nor has anything
occurred to alter the opinion of The Bulle-
tin concerning both ventures. What is left
of (he co.’s capital should be divided among
shareholders right away.
* * * *
Prospectors are again turning their atten-
tion to the old Diorite King district, beyond
Leonora (W.A.). The Little Wonder, from
which Cudmore and party obtained £20,000
in one year, is in this locality. Some very
rich stone was also taken out of one or two
other claims in the vicinity and conveyed
170 miles or more to Southern Cross for
treatment. Values, however, soon petered
and all the shows were abandoned.
* * * *
Cliilde Harold, the show near Laverton
(W.A.) which a venturesome Melbourne co.
has backed, is being equipped with a new'
plant and is billed to start crushing in
August. If yields come up to official expecta-
tions —and, by picking, they may do so fora
time —the exploitation of the property
on a much bigger scale is hinted at. But
unless the reef has changed considerably
since a Bulletin man saw it last share-
holders had better not build on any glitter-
ing returns.
* * * *
From the Melbourne vestibule: —
Here Westonian interests are less spry. The big
stock got a hard knock from ohl speckers, who still
say that the upper levels are a shell, and that unless
things are hustled at the bottom workings there
will have to be an adjustment of grade. Williams’s
last yield worked out at under 15dwt., which of
course didn’t help to buttress the market. The 2s. div.
also was a weird thing, even though £l9OO comes
from the slimes. The truth is that the old gang is
out of the stock, and with no one like Tolhurst to
do the propping the bears can hit shares to leg as
often as they like. It would help if Deeps got its
crosscut out; but it will be some time before that
cau happen. Centrals have at last started to cross-
cut for the new reef. It will take three months to
get there unless Giblin does better than is calcu-
lated. At the moment, faces in the Central are in
stuff that only skims the profit line. Consolidated
is crawling feebly to the battery stage. Things all
the while are so beastly dull that the striking of gold
by the drill at the corner of the Main Leads ground
only serves to drive a few more despondent gamblers
to the Club bar.

When silver-lead mining on Zeehan (Tas.)
was dying and Private Enterprise had thrown
in the towel, Mines Minister Ogden made an
effort to keep the place together by starting
a State mine, the objects being to drain an
area carrying many lodes, which could then
be operated at shallow levels by tributors,
and to sink and cut these lodes at a deeper
level in order to find out their value. They
have all proved disappointing at the deeper
level and the mine is closed down. About
£41,000 has been spent altogether; £13,000
of this being received from the mine, a debit
balance of £28,000 is left. Tributors have
also won about £12,000 from the drained
areas from which the State has drawn
royalty. Although the mine has shown this
direct loss the State has reaped indirect ad-
vantages, and the actual loss is much less.
Mines Minister Lewis will ask Parliament
for a further vote to continue the crosscuts
to other lodes, but it is doubtful whether
more money will be granted, as the mine is
now flooded.

Ronpibon wants more cash, so 5000 shares
in reserve are to be offered by tender to the
folk that are in this Malayan tin show.
Palfreyman’s expectation is that he will
average a full £1 for the lot. The secret is
out that Eric Moore didn’t like the idea
of transferring to Captain Miles’s Deebook
Co. a half interest in the severed block in
return for a dredge. But Palfreyman is
right. The thing these days is to get tin
out quickly, and secure the market. Dredges
that can be instantly handed over are worth
almost their, weight in the metal, and that
is why Trong needn’t be looked at as a
gone coon so long as it has a plant to make
a bargain with.

Austral Malay, which made two or three
fine punches in its early days, did no good
last year. The two options it has been pros-
pecting—Sungei Choh and Bidor —have both
been poor. Bidor has been thrown up ; the
other is being given a further trial. In
addition to its options the co. holds 8000
shares in Ivampong Kamunting and 22,525
(out of 75,000) in Asarn Kambung, in the
same district. The Ivampong and Larut are
also neighbors. The Asam is having its
dredge built in Melbourne, but, on account of
shortage of materials —chiefly plates—which
Australia should have been making for her-
self years ago, the machinery will not be
ready for shipment until about April next.

Kampong Kamunting, one of the Malay
tin concerns introduced to Australia by the

because the co. couldn’t agree with Com-
monwealth authorities as to what was a fair
basis for taxing a rapidly-wasting dredge
property like this. From September 1 to
November 26 the old co. made a profit of
£12,478 out of a revenue of £23,594; and
that was after setting aside £2233 for return
of capital and providing £1435 for deprecia-
tion. In the month or so to the end of
December there was a profit of £2567 from a
revenue of £6878, after setting aside £7OO
for return of capital and providing £503 for
depreciation and £939 for reconstruction
exes. During 1916 the shareholders got 30
p.c. (6s. per share), and “the directors hope
to be able to continue to place to reserve
about £13,000 p.a. as an offset to the ex-
haustion of the property and at the same
time to make an annual distribution of
about 30 p.c. of the co.’s capital.” On pre-
sent appearances, there is nine years’ work
ahead. Capital is 140,000 £1 shares, fully
paid, and on December 31 the co. held,
besides dredging property, plant, shares and
stores, £15,250 invested (war loans and
deposits) and £2274 in cash. It owed only
£l5O. Tin prices are the unknown quantity
in all estimates of dredging prospects; but.
though present boom prices will not be main-
tained. there is little likelihood of a very
poor market. The world seems to be too
badly provided with tin deposits to allow of
that.

Sydney, June 4, 1917.
My Di<:ak Akini. —
When the Official Corkscrew, which was
sent into the world to open everything, from
a bottle of champagne to a Triangle Day, got
into action. Martin-place was humming like
a swarm of bees. Lieufc-Gov. Cullen had the
first pull at the flag. It hung for a while, a
fat sausage of bunting, then graciously
floated in the still air.. The platform for the
flagging was stuffed with Y.M.C.A. backers
—Walter Crane. W. Gillanders, J. T. Til-
lock, E. Iv. Sateliell and J. M. Sandy
amongst the officials. President Crane was
seen to address the crowd, after the same
effort had been made by C.-J. Cullen. Then
Acting-Premier Fuller tried his voice. Same
result! The reporters “were about the only
shai'p-eared people who could catch the
oratory.
A girl got up as a Chinese coolie held up
the traffic when she trotted past the G.P.0.,
a friend at the rear helping to keep the
baskets from tipping over. The Kewpie
(the Dreadful Doll of the moment) and simi-
lar works of art took the place of callot and
cabbagee. She was one of the most success-
ful Trianglers of the day. She got a bite
every minute or two.
Martin-place and its sister thoroughfare,
Moore-street, made a picture such as one
used to see in sketches of carnival days in
the Riviera. June 1 transformed a place of
taxis and recruiting speeches into a bazaar,
where the uniform design of gaily-striped tents
saved us the terrors of the personally-deco-
rated marquee. After an auction of food-
stuffs outside the Commonwealth Bank the
most exhausted-looking citizen was a patriot
in a sweater and other many-pocketed gar-
ments. Large lumps indicating reinforce-
ments of groceries protruded all over his
person. Then he topped his purchases with
a pot plant, and staggered off like an army-
service lorry.
One of the features of lunch-hour was
the rush for the Y.M.C.A. tent in
Moore-street. Here -all the solid dis-
comforts of the . hearty citizen’s mid-
day meal were to be had for a moderate sum.
But the crowd' surged in so fast that the
lunchers sitting on the slope of an undulat-
ing street had to suddenly clutch their ’am
and chicken and fall across the jiggery
tables to avoid a welter of coffec-cwm-salad
dressing. Double Bay V.A.D.’s, with Ella
Richards as hon. head-waitress, carved the
poultry.
The Geebung stall (Mrs. Scott in charge),
which auctioned at-fabulous prices anything
it didn’t sell otherwise, was one of the Moore-
street money-spinners. Late in the afternoon
it had the wilted appearance of a great has-
been, with its stall-holders looking weary but
triumphant. Near it was another live hub —•
a coffee-stall that squirted puffs of smoke
out of a squat chimney. Girls were the only
decoration ; they sold hot drinks as fast as
they could pour them out. There w T as no
deception about this kitchenette. The wash-
ing-up was done on a box behind the stall,
and volunteers, including a soldier or two,
wiped the crockery with a rattle that
sounded like machine-gunning.
The Y.M.C.A. rooms in Moore-street
bubbled and squeaked with shrill demands
to see MacDougall. That general remained
calm when 1000 or so workers bombarded
his trench and yelped for immediate atten-
tion. MacDougall was an experienced Mel-
bourne pressman before he took up Y.M.C.A.
work, and he doesn’t turn a hair in a hustle.
The Australia’s Winter Garden on June 1
was chock-a-block with the perfume of
Pekoe, cocktails for those who required what
one damsel called “solid support,” and cigar-
ette smoke. The tables were packed, at 3s. 6d.
per head, for the cafo chantant arranged by
•Mrs. J. J. Mulligan, of Cremorne.
One thing the afternoon proved: Napoleon
is a back-number and hard to get off in
either raffle or auction. When the chantant
took one bar rest an enthusiastic salesman
tried to raise £lOOO or so for a musical in-
strument said to have been the property of
the famous Corsican. “Twenty b'ob” was
the best offer, so the banjo-mandolin was
hastily dragged away from the sacrificial
altar.
At Saturday’s race meeting there was a
huge majority of the male person to seek the
odds by the bookies’ patch. Near by is
the tote palace, which is going to eat
a big slice out of the green sward of the
saddling-paddock. Already the hyper-sensi-
tive racehorse, exercising between events,
cocks his ears and shies at the new obstruc-
tion. On the lawn there was an absence of
the vim of pre-war gatherings. Society isn’t
so keen as it used to be to advertise its
presence at Randwic-k. It tucks itself away
in the official stand, and only creeps out
to examine the scratehings and sun itself
near the books.
Winter, 1917, has brought the fur coat to
a climax. After gazing at ladies in ermine
—so many pounds' sterling to the square
inch —one sees the merely musquash coat in
battalions. After fur comes the taffeta, shot
and shiny—the last sigh in fashion. Mrs.
A. E. Hughes, just back with her tall hus-
band and babies from India, was in cream
tailor-made. Mrs. George Black, in raven
silk, wore her pet plumed millinery. Mrs.
Charles Waldron came with Aunty Brunton.
the latter in the kind of black velvet richly,
braided that went out of fashion years ago
and has come back with a rush. The Pat
Keunas and the Fred McMasters, genuine
sports, were in the walled-in official eyrie.
It takes a special gold key to open this big
shed. Mrs. Dicky Richards had a look at the
dwindling members in the stand that used
to be the mould' of fashion. But the jade
passes it by now for the latter-day abode
at the far end of the Randwick lawns. Mrs.
Val Osborne in magpie turnout —and the
fur coat everywhei-e. This gives the first day
of the winter meeting in a breath.
There’s the bishop’s hat —or whatever
the atrocity is called —to be reckoned
with this winter. At the races the
fearsome millinery, which looks like
an Eiffel Tower in black velvet, sat
in majesty on the nicest matron’s best
plaits. A mediaeval archbishop might have
used this kind of head-cosy in frosty weather.
But it’s an affliction in sunny Sydney.
Here is a recent Cruden photo of J. .1.
Virgo, the virile general sec. of the Y.M.C.A.
The South Australian was in 1886 associ-
ated with the Adelaide branch of the Y.M.
and shook things up for 14 years in the Holy
City. Then he was whisked over to Syd-
ney. As an organiser, Virgo put new meat
into an association that, before his time, was
mostly milk-and-water. As a subscription-
raiser ho had few rivals. During his eight
years here he got
money out of aston-
ished citzens before
they were aware of
it. Sinners might
go to the Y.M.C.A.
rooms to scoff. If
Virgo was about they
stayed to pay. Aus-
tralia lost him when
lie was called to
London to take over
the general _ over-
seer’s job in' 1911.
Last year lie came
back on a visit.
Since then he has
been dashing from
Front to Front, en-
couraging the enthu-
siasts who carry soup
and coffee to the trenches as calmly as if
only compliments were floating about their
ears.
The blue-eyed Temperley Mistress-of-Arts,
who came from Vic. to talk recruiting, got
a lot of hoorays on the eve of her “urgent
recall” on Friday. Shrouded in a blue veil
and antique motor-bonnet, the little lady
made her last appeal with dramatic effect,
and in doing it somehow subtly suggested
Nellie Stewart in spots. The small recruiter
owns the true speaker’s wide mouthpiece,
besides a ring on the “reserved” finger.”
Odds-on the circlet concerns someone in
khaki!
“King’s Birthday” brought only a knight-
hood apiece to N. S. Wales, Victoria and S.
Australia. Money talked each time. The
G.-G.’s crony, the estimable Colonel Burns,
of the shipping firm, achieved the expected
K.C.M.G. There is in this case no Lady:
Mrs. Burns died a few years ago. Victoria’s
representative in the list is Edward, of . the
“Money” Miller clan; and S. Australia’s
that Professor Stirling who has used his
means to feed the flame of his enthusiasm
for scientific research.
St. Vincent’s Hospital has witnessed a
minor miracle: £9OO was dredged from the
fete which was drowned on the opening day.
This and £773 from the J.C3.W. matinee in
Her Majesty’s were handed to the Sisters
the other afternoon —all for the building of
another storey. John Lane Mullins said the
thanks that the occasion called for.
Waverley-Bondi has a vigorous branch of
the Red Cross tree. Lady Helen and sonsy
Lady Doris Blackwood motored out that way
the other afternoon to have a few words with
the workers. Socks, munition-making in
England, and the unbreakable spirit of the
Frenclrwoman were the texts. The district
member, Colonel Jim Onslow, murmured a
few words in reply.
A war wedding in London —Helen Burns,
of Christchurch to Sergeant McMaster, of
S. Canterbury—will interest many Maon-
landers. The bride’s mother, Mrs. Gower-
Burns, is M.L.’s best amateur soprano.
When Maorilander Macdonald had finished
his wheat deal for the Dominion Govern-
ment, he returned to Wellington with his
missus. The pleasant, homely dame had
never been out of M.L. before (hubby is
member for Bay of Plenty), and takes back
to quiet Gisborne yards of narrative about
the Australian Girl and other lively topics.
On Saturday afternoon, at Scots’ kirk,
there was a quiet khaki wedding. Eliza
Josephson, of Randwick, took for peace or
war Theodore Storey, A.1.F., a son of the
David Storeys. The ’groom’s only sister,
Ruby, was bridesmaiden in azure blue. The
bride went through the ceremony in an
attractive ivory tailor-made, with black mil-
linery. Sergeant Stewart Hordern was
second-best man. The cake was cut at
Petty’s. After the ’moon, the new husband
goes off to the Front to lend a hand to
brother Jack, who has had a long bout in
the trenches.
A friendly nurse who sometimes sends me
a line from London. says she had
“just .met Dr. Taylor Young, who was
disenjoying eight • days’ leave prepara-
tory to going over to France. (No one
enjoys anything in England in March, unless
it be the daffodils.) Ever since his arrival
from Sydney, early in the wartime. Dr.
Taylor Young has been attached to the Third
London General Hospital; now by a coinci-
dence he again joins a 3rd General, but
this time Australian, so at last he will
have colleagues from down south The
3rd at Wandsworth was something uncom-
mon. It had at one time two ex-queens as
nurses, many titled women as orderlies, and
almost the entire membership of the Chelsea
Art Club as helpers of one sort or other;
among them Tom Roberts, Coates, Streeton,
Derwent Wood and Full wood.
“Of Dr. Flashmau’s almost sudden death
in France from pneumonia, Dr. Taylor Young
says the loss to the medical profession was
immense. Dr. Flashman was constantly at
it during his 14 months over there, and he
was accurately recording all his work, and
devoting all his ‘spare’ time to heart and
nerve cases. Probably his work will be lost
unless some friend can make use of his
notes and records.”-
The Taylor Youngs’ eldest boy is some-
where in the Mediterranean, and the second
is at Rugby.
Nell McQuade, of Potts Point, has
engaged herself to a rubber prince from
Kuala Lumpur, Malay States, by name
Sidney Morgan. Father Fred McQuade’s
hospitality and organ-playing are renowned,
and his salads and ragouts have not their
equal in Australia. Nell has been absent
from Sydney for a couple of years, and did
hospital work after the outbreak of war.
The French Music Society’s concert didn’t
get into action till nearly half-past eight, so
the over-harbor visitors were writhing into
their neck-warmers before the end came. A
viceregal party from Admiralty House,
chaperoned by Consul Chayet, got in
early. Then came local society, furred
to the ears, with exceptions in favor
of the striped silk mufflers which
protect some of ‘ our Best People’s
bead necklets. A small, straw coal-scuttle
bonnet in passing to its seat created a slight
diversion. But this is war time, and we
shall come to papier mache tiaras before the
climax. Pianist Winifred ; Burston and
Staell with his fiddle gripped the audience
in Gabriel Faure’s Sonata. The Queensland
girl, playing with the delicate touch that
made Leonard Borwick so alluring, collected
garden tributes for her later efforts in com-
positions by Debussy and Alkan. Goossens
(Miss Puech with never a scrap of music
score at the piano) was in magnificent voice.
Mrs. Allard and Philip Wilson were also in
the list.
Doris Mclnnes, a young Victorian, made
her bow to Sydney’s Nicest at this concert.
She is the owner of a fine soprano, but as
yet ought to keep off such difficult and
tricky music as the Mad Scene from “Ham-
let” (Ambroise Thomas). With immature
technique, Doris’s voice has a tendency to
get shrill on top. When she lets it go like
a steam whistle, it’s a. pity.
The Munro Fergusons are going to sample
Sinco. They take the Irrigation trip on
eir way back to the Yarra. Later on—
which is very indefinite —his Ex. hopes to
see the Dorrigo big-timber country.
About 12 months ago a Citizens’ Com-
mittee was formed in each State to force
a steady stream of money to the Y.M.C.A.
at the Front. Very few of the leading men
on these pumps have any connection in
peace time with the Young Men. In every
case they are business heads bringing their
commercial training to the work. They are
overlords both of getting and spending funds.
When you see that Victoria raised about
£87,000 in the last 12 ftionths you know the
Clutching Hand of a Citizens' Committee
has been busy.
On Triangle Day in N. S. Wales cash
came in a golden shower —probably £lOO,OOO
glittering, raindrops.
Which is a figure of
speech, because all
that’s money doesn’t
glitter nowadays.
Anyhow, it was the
work of the Clutch-
ing Maud of a Citi-
zens' Com m i ttee
again. Here is its
chairman —G. Mason
Allard, who steered
the campaign
through many diffi-
culties. For, as you
may suppose, difficul-
ties will occur. The
Y.M.C.A. itself is a
huge blend, and some
peo p 1 e’s mid-Vic-
torian ideas have to
be put into the melting-pot now and then
when financial brains get busy.
The •Journalists’ Institute gave a lunch
this week in honor of Major-General Legge,
one of the Permanent officers who have been
sent for to help clean up the hideous Defence
Department mess at home. Formerly a
High School teacher, then a barrister, Legge
is something extra as writer and speaker.
He thrilled the listening press with graphic
anecdotes and pithy stories of the great
struggle in France. To that half of Aus-
tralia which doesn’t realise that there’s a
war to the death, General Legge makes his
special appeal. “England was perhaps slow
to take all the responsibilities of the situa-
tion. -But now? Well, the man who steps
out of a train finds his luggage snapped up
by two women porters. llis taxi is driven
by a woman, and his hotel is ‘manned’ by
the same sex. All over England women are
working in .tlm uniforms that show what
their occupations are. Hero? Well, it's
like coming from war to peace to land in
Australia.” Tim General’s vivid description
of the fight for Pozieres ought to be made
into one of those little war stories which
Justice Ferguson suggests should be in the
hands of every school-kiddy.
To help the Y.M.C.A. in its big appeal
Mrs. Sargent had a three days’ cafe clian-
tant in the ballroom of the Sargent Co.’s
Market-street premises. May Summerbelle
rounded up the performers, and bright pro-
grammes included Marsh Little, Colin
Crane and Leah Myers, with Minnie
Hooper’s pupils in charming ballets. These
lively youngsters,’ in microscopic tulle skirts,
tried to be as like Genee as they knew how.
A babies’ ballet, and the children of Hartley
Sargent (a prisoner of war in Germany)
in snacks of infantile e-locution, opened the
show.
There are two songs, by May Fenner, to
be had at Paling’s. If you buy “Fiji Boys”
the money will go to the Fiji Patriotic
Fund; if you buy “Give, Give,” the coin
drops into the Sydney Red Cross's money-
box. Mrs. Fenner is the wife of the mana-
ger of the Sugar Co. in Fiji, and she has
handsomely paid all the cost of publishing.
Incidentally, she has done a finer thing still
—sent three sons to the Front. They are all
old King School boys.
A cascade of socks has tumbled into the
War Chest—6o,ooo pairs towards the
100,000 asked for. The packers get into the
hive in Macdoncll House while their stay-at-
home friends are still discussing the break-
fast bacon. System has been brought to a
fine art in this depot. The damsel who
flitted across to another table merely to dis-
cuss the newest hats would be jerked back
to business with a sharp turn.
Comforts dames had sleepless nights
over the pooling business. It seems neces-
sary to hand over Billzac’s socks and other
woollen comforts to the War Chest here; but
Bill’s shirts, pyjamas and tinned sustenace
will continue to go direct from the battalion
or brigade depots to the trenches. The 13th
and 45th Battalions’ Fund, Mrs. Barff in
command, adopted this plan at a recent
meeting.
Under doctor’s orders Mrs. Arthur Verdon
has given up her work in a French hospital
pro tern. She is now resting in London. In
her young days she was Grace Carroll, one
of the prettiest girls in Goulburn, where her
husband (now away on a Russian mission)
wooed the fair lady.
South Sydney Hospital, out Waterloo-
Zetland way, ought to feel more affluent
after Friday night. For that’s the date of
a benefit carnival at the Stadium. The pro-
gramme. threatens to extend into Saturday
morning if the galaxy of talent gets too
many encores.
It is a dreadful war. After sending steam-
ers to us for 65 years the gold-braided P- and
O. says it can’t do it any longer. But I
suppose there will be a branch line from
Bombay,
Yours affectionately,
VANDORIAN.

IT SAVED
a Gallant Anz&c's Life!
FROM the blood-stained fields of Pozieres, through
immortal deeds that have made Australia famous, this
Steel-Lined Military Pocket Wallet has come back
to us, a speaking tribute to the service it has rendered.
During the advance on Pozieres its owner, A. J. Cousins, of
the 54th Battalion, A.1.F., was struck by a shrapnel bullet,
but the steel lining of the Wallet worn in his breast pocket
saved his life.
The force of the shrapnel may be judged by a -careful
scrutiny of the photograph, of the razor-like cut through
the solid leather, the deep indentation of the heavy steel
lining within, and the battered Identification disc.
This Wallet was kindly lent by A. J. Cousins, at present
invalided home, suffering from, high-explosive shell wounds
received subsequent to the battle of Pozieres.

MELBOURNE CHATTER
Melbourne, June 4, 1917.
My Dear Yarrie.—
Governor Stanley made a speech and Lady
Stanley stood and smiled upon the opening
of Ye Okie English Fayre. His Ex. kindly
said the place looked like a hit of
Chester. What more could you want? The
houses are very realistic, but they leave off
at the end of the hall, and a gap in the
scenery is tilled by the familiar south gallery
and clock. Those seats, however, are the only
ones available. Fayre haunters may sit no-
where but in the tea-room, which is manned
by V.A.D.'s from Sassiety ranks. Girls in
Olde English clothes are thick as bees and
their stings are raffle tickets. The wanderer
cannot escape them: Sassiety matrons toil
out of the Town Hall laden with eggs, jams,
jellies and cakes. Baldwin Spencer. Man-
sou of Maoriland and architect Annear
were in the thick of the fun. Melba came
with her shadow, Lady Susan. The Hen-
nessy dame, whose Town Hall is her castle,
wore a hunched purple velvet gown with a
real bustle.
Lady Susan Fitzclarence (they call her “a
dear little woman”) lately opened a fair for
Melba in connection with the Lilydale Gym-
khana —a King’s Birthday show. Melba
was indisposed and her visitor took the job
off her hands. Lilydale mustered well and
the Deschamps, Crosses. McMichaels, Twom-
beys, Blairs and Oswald Symes all helped
with stalls. They raised over £2OO in the
one day.
The Forrest dame’s huge blue car is again
in commission and rolls down Collins-street
at the fashionable hours. Bigjolm and she
are established in a flat at the Grand for
the winter. The poor old knight goes about
with bandaged head like a returned war-
rior. He has had two bothersome operations
lately.
Bussell Clarke’s wife is in Melbourne
again on her way home to Rupertswood.
The lady made an attempt to reach England
in face of the prohibition, but was halted
at South Africa. Hubby was travelling
north by transport about the same time.
Dolly Pitt, daughter of the architect-
politician, is a V.A.D. in England, and
writes out disappointedly about the sights
of London. Nearly everything of most
interest, in Westminster Abbey and else-
where, is sandbagged out of sight as a pro-
tection against Zep. bombs.
The old home of the Gaud Mayoral Hen-
nessys in Brighton-road is no more. The
land "has been cut up, the house pulled down
and Hennessy-avenue carved through its
middle. The premises were very old, and
belonged to Mr. Quinlan Daly, the Hen-
nessy dame’s father, from very early days.
The homeless family has now taken one of
the new flats at the Grand Hotel.
Squatter Tom Shaw, of Wooriwyrite, is
sitting up after many anxious weeks of ill-
ness punctuated by the usual operation. For
a time the doctors looked gloomy, and the
whole Shaw family (barring the son in the
trench) came to town to be near the invalid.
Miss Lulu Hauser, a sylph-like girl of the
lily-fair type, reached 21 years of discre-
tion and wealth on Saturday, and her
devoted father gave her the party of her life.
They took the Savoy for dinner, and the
eating and speechmaking lasted from 7 till
10. Then the couple of hundred guests
danced into Sunday morning. Lulu’s dress
was a bridal-looking fluff of vandyked tulle
spread wide over a sheath of swathed white
satin. Her very fair hair hung in a Psyche
knot. Sister sat alongside. in blush-pink
edged with baby roses, and Mrs. Hauser
wore royal purple. A very small sister
pranced about in hunter’s pink tulle.
Mrs. Staughton lent her ballroom at St.
Neots for a lecture by Miss Mayer on her
recollections of the Holy Land. This
lady was there just before the war, and
was able to give the company the breathless
news that Gaza, where there was hot fight-
ing the other day, was the burial-place of
Solomon, the king who provided chaff for 2000
horses at a time in his underground stables.
(For further particulars see the Bible.)
Mrs. Staughton (never mind Solomon now!)
had arranged the ballroom as a comfy draw-
ing-room, so the lecturess was able to just
make a friendly, confidential talk of it all.
There was a little music, and young Mrs.
Sam Staughon played accompaniments. Mr.
and Mrs. Cavanagh (very old Warrnambool
identities) were in town and listened in the
charmed circle. Mrs. Staughton herself
found it so interesting that she is inviting
Miss Mayer to give a second talk about the
oppressive rule of Poland by Prussia. She
will speak from first-hand knowledge on this
subject, too; for, though Miss Mayer herself
was born in Australia, her father and mother
and numerous relations were Polish.
Ada Armytage organised a heath-picking
expedition on Sunday, the blossom to be sold
at Ye Olde English Fayre during the week.
The helpers went into the hill country by
the excursion train that breaks the Mel-
bourne Sabbath, or by the motor that rolls
over it. The energetic Armytage girl is
now "trying-out” a squab farm whereon to
breed the big pigeons so beloved of American
and French epicures. She hopes to demon-
strate the profits that could be made in the
business by invalided soldiers.
The Italian lied Cross had its half-day on
Saturday afternoon, when a huge party
filled the Australia. Sassiety “took tables”
and invited guests. Tenor Lois, left like 4
shining meteor behind the trail of the
Italian opera comet, sang four songs in his
best voice from the balcony, with Ricardo's
orchestra accompanying. Ilis wife flashed
black eyes iii the well of the hall and partied
with Mrs. Polilman. Mrs. Ross Soden had
one big tableful, and Mrs. Richardson, Mrs.
Bowes Kelly and Mrs. Miller hostessed
others.
A lot of people, R.C.’s and otherwise,
knew Mother Mary Xavier Macdonald, who
for 80 years was attached to the Richmond
Convent. When war broke out the nun was
in Belgium and could not get away. So she
remained there “interned” and died in Feb-
ruary, at Brussels, her prison city.
Ilagelthorn, Minister for Agriculture, had
a sad time last week. Ilis sweet little
daughter died from coll&pse after an oper-
ation. Mr. Ilagelthorn was away at Dookie
Agricultural College, and the family tried
all Friday night to communicate with him ;
hut the present arrangement of six o’clock
closing for everything telephonic and tel-
egraphic in the country made it absolutely
impossible. He found the message on his
hotel breakfast-table on Saturday, and trav-
elled home by fast motor, but arrived an
hour too late.
There was deep war-gloom over the Birth-
day Meeting at Flemiugton. A mere handful of
promonaders turned up to what used to be a
fashion parade. The weather was beautiful,
the sky blue, the grass green, and the air
just right for smart Autumn frocks. But
most of the best-dressers stayed away.
The Oodbys were out, and started the day
most cheerfully by winning the first two
races. Mrs. Codby bloomed in leaf-brown
garments, and sister-in-law Miss Godby slung
her huge wolfskin cape at a jauntier angle.
Mrs. Dickenson wore dark-blue cloth, and
carried the newest kind of muff—an ermine
fragment about as big as a couple of mit-
tens. Mrs, Alf Dunlop caught the eye when
she walked the lawn in a flared ermine cape
and a purple gown. Mrs. 11. Cooper, a
bride, wore blue tailorings and a green
buckle in her black hat, so defying super-
stition. Mrs. Rogers Thompson plunged on
sapphire blue. Mrs. Macka.v (Fan Dango)
got into prune-colored duds and under a
flat hat. Mrs. Russell Gabb carried a load
of polecat, whose other name is fitch. Mrs.
Russell Clarke came out in white cloth —
and furs, of course.
Adelaide’s manifesto:—
At Victorisf Park on Saturday the race of the day,
the City Handicap, was won by Mrs. Allan McFar-
lane’s Petracia, and Mrs. R. M. Hawker’s Cyklon
captured the Parkside Stakes; so you see, my dear,
we girls can do something more than win the war.
Evidently Luck has kept a kindly eye on Mrs.
McFarlane. She was given her choice of one of
half a dozen yearlings that her husband bouglht
about three years ago, and she picked Petracia.
Since then it has transpired that the mare’s former
owner never meant her for sale, and it was only by
accident that she came into the ring.
The Government has refused to compromise on
the art-union question, and even on Australia Day
lottery excitements are to be taboo. Chief-Secretary
Styles has suddenly discovered that art-unions’ “legi-
timate object is the furtherance of art, its encourage-
ment and extension,” and he can’t persuade himself
that that object is attained by the chance of win-
ning silk stockings or fur coats.
At last we are to have a receiving-home where
mental invalids can be accommodated, instead of
being despatched straight to the asylum at Parkside
as at present. Forty acres of land at Enfield have
been bought, and building is to begin almost imme-
diately.
Forty-five outward-bound S. Australian nurses
were given a friendly hand at the Lady Colton
Hall by the Army Nurses’ Club on Wednesday. The
Governor personally carried good wishes from Lady
Galway, who is still under medical censorship. Gen.
Forsyth added a word based on his experiences at
the Front.
Died during the week, Robert Knowles, who about
two years ago retired from the management of D.
and W. Murray, Ltd., after 67 years’ service. Mr.
Knowles was one of the founders of the Prisoners’
Aid Association and one of the Sick Poor Fund’s
keenest supporters.
A dinner at Government House was the sole item
of dissipation provided for the High Court Judges
while they were here. Members of our own Bench
and Bar and some unwigged citizens were minor
guests.
A Military Medal and a commission have glad-
dened Mrs. Hall Henderson and her son. The lad has
given a good account of himself in France. An
M.C. has been awarded to Lieut. D. Yates.
It needs no statistics to convince us about the
wetness of the last 12 months, but apparently we
have put up a record —-35.20 in., which is 14.25 over
our. average for 78 years. In the Hills districts
over 70in. was registered at some stations, Uraidla
topping the list with 74.53.
The correction of a wrongly-reported casualty
arrived just in time to stop a sorrowful business at
Keyneton. The church had been decorated with flags
and violets and a memorial service was to have
been held the next day, when cabled news came that
Pte. Finn (who a fortnight before had been reported
killed in action) had been only wounded.
Louis Crevelli, son of the popular Albert
Park doctor, has sustained a heart wound in
France, at the hands of Yvonne Huet. The
charmer is a Parisian, and her own and the
Crevelli family are old friends.
Tall, slim and personable Violet Thornley
is engaged to Dr. Lillies. (“Violet” and
“Lillies” sounds dreadfully like a Ruskin
book or a horticultural catalogue.) The doc-
tor is a widower with two pretty twin
daughters and two sons on active service,
one also a medico. Violet is the well-dowered
daughter of the late Nathan Thornley.
Last Tuesday Dr. Frank de Crespigny
met the Court widow's elder daughter Noel
in the church. The bride, blushing becom-
ingly in white satin and old lace, was
handed.over to the khakied bridegroom by
Uncle Arthur Moule. Sister Dorothea was
a bridesmaid in white-silk fixings, whilst
Dr. Praagst, grandson of late Argus Editor
Willoughby, looked after the hero—some-
what nervous before a mighty gathering of
the Moule and de Crespigny clans. At cham-
pagne time. Uncle Judge Moule and Trinity
College Warden Leeper juggled oratory
Great-aunt Hughes, convoyed by the
Brigadier-General son and his clerical
brother, c.ame in for a lot of attention. The
fine-looking old lady is over 90.
Mi’s. Septimus Miller’s brother, , Lieut.
Henderson, has been severely wounded, and
is now in hospital in France. He was' a
well-known accountant, amateur boxer and
tennis player before he enlisted in the Royal
Garrison Artillery.
Dr. Eddie Spowers, brother to the Argus
man, is voyaging towards the trenches.
Youngest sister Alice, who attacks grand
pianos (one at a time) with quite profes-
sional skill, will keep the home fires burn-
ing and the butter on ice while he is away.
The Mounted Police lent half a dozen
horses to girls who rode on Friday and
Saturday; but having lent horseflesh before,
they insisted this time on a rehearsal. So
the girls went down to the police barracks
and the nags were put through all their
tricks. The candidates who passed muster
were allowed a charger apiece and were
initiated into the signs by which these
educated animals work. ’ Varying pres-
sure of the heel will make a police
horse sit down in the street, or
kneel, or kick, or whinny the National
Anthem. . You have to know all about it
before you can get your chief engineer’s cer-
tificate. Eily Fitzsimmons, the artist
daughter of a squattocrat, came out head of
the class and was .given the lead and the
banner to carry. Eily, who can ride any-
thing, breaks in hunters for pastime when
she is not studying pansy-painting at the
Gallery. She won the High Jump (Ladies'
hacks) at Fieinington Show last year.
Maggie McCann had a gay hour or two
at the Austral Salon last week. She
addressed the company on Burns in her very
best Glasgie accent and supplemented her
remarks with songs and music. Maggie
(Mrs. Colquhoun Thompson off the plat-
form) did so well that the Highland lassies
present declared the party to be graun.
The Liedertafel (they’ll be changing their
name soon) gave a British Red Cross Con-
cert in the Town Hall the other Wednesday
night._ Mansley Greer conducted, and
Amadio, Collier, Elsie Treweek. Billy Bur-
rell (accompanist) and Dr. Price (organ)
all helped the choir along.
David Low headed the squad of cavaliers
who advertised the advent of Ye Olde Eng-
lish Faire on Saturday. Also Dorotnea Low
let her hair down for the ride and was more
sympathetic to her adopted period than her
artist brother. Dave wore no blond curls
as cavaliers should, and sat his nedd.v in
the intense manner of . a young jock at his
first Cup. Moreover, there was a differ-
ence of nearly 300 years between his
clothes and his moustache. The latter bit
of fluff belongs to the Charlie Chaplin epoch.
Mrs. Burley Griffin, architect herself
and wife of another, and sculptress Mar-
garet Baskerville had a special Australia
tea-party to view the completed statuary
which decorates the interior. Echo hangs
on to one pillar and the reverse is decorated
with sculped almond-blossom of Spring
Daphne stands in a field of rye, and her
pillar blossoms with oranges. Persephone
steps out from a branch of summer cherries.
Mrs. Griffin talked learnedly of classic
statuary, and Sassiety nodded sagely over
its hot muffin.
The army nurses had a theatre party at
the Royal on Saturday to see the first of
“A Little Bit of Fluff.” They brightened up
the stalls with their snowy-white headker-
chiefs, scarlet capes and good complexions.
Dorothy Purdell, as the Bit of Fluff, has
some, lovely gowns to fluff in. One is a
misty periwinkle blue with a crazy sash of
Nile green. The sash ties in the front, and
the wide ends travel upward. Daisy Ather-
ton mingles pale purple and fuchsia red in
one elaborate gow„n. Rene Tanswell. as
Aunt Hannah, follows the modern tradition
for the heavy lady of comedy, and wears
puce satin. Of the men, Percy Marmont,
who is agile as well as tall, has fascinating
white hair and expressive legs. In fact, he
does most of his acting with his legs.
Our boys continue to collect war decora-
tions at a bewildering rate. The George
Kelly widow has had a coo-ee from son
Charlie in France, with word that his is a
Military Cross. Ernest Clienery, nephew of
Mrs. George Chirnside and an early Anzae,
has an Italian decoration. And Ashby
Hooper, elder son of Goldsbrough’s youthfui-
looking manager, has been mentioned in
dispatches. After pulling' an oar in the
Head of the River race (1917), young
Hooper went to England and sheltered with
Auntie Wesley Hall while he qualified for
a commission.
Arthur Cooke, who shone at the best two-
stepping frivols in the vanished Peace Era.
is now flying for his country, and sends along
a note saying he has persuaded an English
girl to accept the usual ring. Her name is
Nora .Tenner.
Yours sincerely.
JOHANNA.

“Fjourb'ag'’: Solomon, ‘“king” of the Dar-
win tribe, just dead, was fond of a discussion con-
cerning the relative merits, in life, of civilisation
and barbarism; and.to one who had the patience and
tried to understand his peculiar philosophy, his
views were well worth while. lie gave the white
man credit for being very clever, but considered lie
lacked commonsense, for he held that the white
man, with all his strife and struggle, never attained
what he was after—contentment and happiness—.
whereas the blackfellow was perfectly happy and
perfectly contented in his natural state until the
white feller interfered with him. He believed that a
state where there were few people and plenty of space
was far preferable to a condition where people were
crowded and space limited, and he wondered why (he
white feller couldn’t see it. Nature provided for the
few without effort, but the white feller made nature
COMPLIMENTARY.
DEAR OLD LADY: “You've no idea how popular you are. Old Mrs. Banks says you're
the best minister we've ever had; hut, then everybody knows she's not all there."
and all hands work overtime to keep going, and then
worked up to a tremendous fight over it, c.g., the
present war. Paint, a public tassel and a handful
of spears, he considered, were all that was necessary
to carry a man through life decently, and he main-
tained that a black fellow never, became offensive until
he took to wearing a shirt and trousers. (This
philosophy being propounded in the tropics, the
writer fully agrees with it.) Solomon never drank
booze or used opium. In the initiation ceremonies
ot the nims (boys) to the rank of bglea (young man)
Solomon invariably added to the tribal lore imparted
to the novices the injunction not to drink, for that
was the vice that made the white man the damfool
lie generally is when in a blackmail’s camp. But
booze beats the balea almost invariably just the
same. By the way, for tlie white man who professed
to have been initiated to aboriginal rites and to
know all about them, Solomon had the greatest con-
tempt. Why any white -man should want to be a
black man he couldn’t understand, and why he
should lie about it was more puzzling still. Xo
white man could be, under any circumstances, and no
black man ever was, initiated into Larrakia manhood
without getting the father of a hiding many times
repeated during the process. (One young buck i~
being put through now not far away from me. The
larrabas—-old men—have been belting an education
into him for a week, and they are only about half-
way through with him.) Xo one was ever “made a
man” by an inland tribe without undergoing the
“terrible rite.” Only one white man has ever been
introeised. to my knowledge. He is -t ill alive in
the Xoi -West, and. though the tribe did that for
him to gratify a cranky whim, they did not impart
the tribal secrets that a native would have learned.
Solomon was ready at any time to convoke the elders
of the tribe and confer any degree on a white man
for a pound of tobacco, and give letters-patent o'er
“his x mark” into the bargain. He had in his time
thus raised several white anthropologists to the
aboriginal peerage.
‘’Trooper Blueguni": Anyone out in the
Xever Xever know how to deal with a jibbing eantel ?
If so, alt of Billjims in the Camel Corps will be
mighty grateful to hear from him. The CJyppio
method is simplicity itself, but it takes too long.
The native just exclaims “Maleeseh!” and lies down
alongside the other animal and sleeps. By the time
he wakes up. the camel lias forgotten what it was
jibbing about. Our methods are far more strenu-
ous but far less efficacious, hence this appeal. Our
patrol bad covered VJ miles in one day (this is not
a record, but good going). Next day one of the
camels jibbed, and then settled down to admire the
scenery. Five minutes’ helping with jaiuboks did
no good. We lit a fire under bis tail, but. he
merely yawned. Then one of the mob had a bril-
liant idea, lie poured water, which we could ill
spare, into the devil’s car, But his jill- didn’t even
shake his ljcad. The operator reckoned that it was
the wrong car, lint we couldn’t risk more water.
All our few well-chosen remarks and other expedi-
ents were exhausted; and the camel still sat on top
of his sandhill and would tint budge. Finally we
made a toboggan of him. We, dragged .him to the
edge of the hill, four cameliars jumped on his fibs,
and in a whirl of sand, legs, grunts and blanky
the mix-up poured to the bottom. But next time
the might jib at the base of the hill. So cable
the recipe.
“Harrison O.”: Cockatoos do get drunk.
When 1 was around the Camperdown (Vic.) district
recently, l frequently saw cockatoos lying on their
backs, their wings limp, their legs in the air and
their feathers looking like the hair of a poet who
lias been searching for a rhyme for “window.” Upon
questioning an inhabitant, who, 1 ifeel sure, would
not pull the leg of a simple town dweller, I was
told that the birds were slacker. Cocky’s favorite
pub is any paddock that supplies onion-weed. He
lo.ves the weed for the narcotic qualities of its essen-
tial juices, and once lie starts on it he can’t swear
oil. Me just keeps on hivin’ amizzrr until he is
down and out. The trouble from the farmer’s point
of view is that the hardest doers among the birds
of the Western District cannot eat enough onion
weed to rid the country of the pest.
“H.Y.E.”: Incidentally, the phosphorus
and strychnine strewn for rabbits have practically
wiped out the native cat ( dasyurus ). Before the
advent of rabbit I took no less than 32 of
these small, smellful animals out of the carcase of a
large bullock lying on a Slonaro plain. They' had
AN OVERSIGHT ON A COLD NIGHT.
SMALL BOY ( awakening suddenly) : “Damn it! I forgot to say me prayers /”
completely eaten out the beast’s entrails and were
stripping 1 the meat off the bones. The slain included
a considerable percentage of the rarer and more hand-
some variety—jet black with large rounded white
spots. Other victims of rabbit-poison include the
platypus (occasionally), gohanna, and, of course, birds
of many species. A stock inspector tells me that he
found a black snake lying in death throes, evidently
resulting from a bait of strychnine and jam. Botli
snakes and gohannas occasionally, include unusual
articles in their diet. In one instance a large gohanna
came to a cow-bail in quest of a drink from the
milk-pail. The teat-puller (a lassie fresh from
Scotland.) bravely tackled the monster with the
yard-broom. The light ended in the badly-scared
gohanna climbing on the woman's shoulder- no tree
being handy—and she bears the claw scratches to
this day.

“Wart”: “E.S.S.” (B. 19/4/’l7) inquires
the range of the willy-wagtail. Some time ago T
made a trip to North Queensland from Tasmania,
staying for a few days at each capital. At each
stopping-place I found willy-wagtail one of the
friendliest and most common birds in the suburban
garden. When I reached the canefields “Willy” was
just as plentiful, and about the only old acquaint-
ance I could find. He is plentiful all‘over Tasmania,
and is the only one of our Tasmanian flycatchers that
winters at home, the leaden flycatcher and the
shining flycatcher both being migratory.
“Nick Bottom” : During the dry spell that
struck the N. S. Wales Northern Rivers in 1914-15
the magpies and butcher-birds- of the district made
friends, with the kiddies at my university; and during
the lunch-hour it was a common sight to see half a
dozen “wild” mags, and four or five butchers hopping
around for titbits of bread, meat or cheese, etc. After
the meal our feathered cobbers used to perch on the
fence and warble songs of thanksgiving 1 the whole
afternoon. Therefore I am able, on direct evidence,
to refute the statement of (B. 26/4/’l7)
that “the mellow, flute-like notes of the butcher-bird
would place it on top by just one mark.” This
would perhaps be true if the butcher-bird were sole
agent for flute-like notes ; but the mag. is also the
possessor of several, the richest of which makes the
very best efforts of the butcher-bird sound like the
top notes of a tin-whistle by comparison. Add to this
the joyful persistency with which the magpie carols
for minutes at a time compared with the disjointed
snatches of melody from the smaller bird, and you
must give the worm to Maggie. In fact, the magpie
sings grand opera; while the butcher is, at the best,
no more than an excellent vaudeville entertainer.
- JJ “
Boro-Belle”: The most industrious tribe
of abos. I ever knew was a band of about 18, whose
smoky-looking caves stood on the picturesque bank-
of the Pioneer River, Mackay (Q.). In the daytime
the gins used to go into town and scrub house-floors,
while the bucks went into the surrounding scrubs and
gathered matchbox beans, orchids, tree ferns and
clothes-line props. What time they were not so
engaged they went trapping fish and crabs, or gather-
ing mangrove bark. Their commercial pursuits did
not end there, for one day a week one chap went
round 'with a bell and acted as town-crier for auction
sales and sports gatherings. Another dusky lad had
a permanent job in the Labor Day procession, his
tableaux being a representation of a “black” lmteher-
shop. One night, after heavy rain up-iountry, the
river came down a banker, and in the grey dawn the
pilot-boat rescued the disgusted members of the
settlement from their lofty perches in Ihe tree-tops.
After the flood-waters subsided a new camp was
established,' but the river three weeks later repeated
the trick; whereupon the tribe became disgusted and
bolted to Xebo, some 00 miles inland, where they
joined the mountain blacks.
“Luke : As a mimic the black magpie, or
white-winged chough, when tame, is quite equal to
the ordinary cage-pof magpie (crow-shrike), parrot
or cockatoo. This bird will cackle like a laying hen,
gobble like a turkey-cock, cluck sadly like his
missus, and quickly pick up snatches of the latest
vaudeville gems. Jt is quite without the devilry
of the common magpie, which, when tamed, is always
hungering for a bit of one’s flesh, and enjoys nothing
better than a chase after bare-legged youngsters.
The black magpie is gregarious in habit and social-
istic in breeding arrangements, several females lay-
ing in the one large mud-bowl nest, which sometimes
contains seven eggs. Being strictly insectivorous the
young black magpie is not nearly so easy to rear
as the other, which, can be brought up on chopped
raw meat alone. Bui, anyhow, both the common
and black magpie and their eggs and young are now
protected by law from capture, destruction, etc., as
both birds are useful in annually accounting for a
multitude of white grubs, caterpillars, beetles, spiders
and other creepers and crawlers we can well do
without.
“Stiugaree Rill": The Afghans often patch
up a camels saddle-gall, or any open wound,
with a fresh piece of hide off some newly-killed
animal—bullock, dog or anything—and sewing it on'
with a camp-needle and thread. That’s why some
old camels look like ancient pants, I once saw oik*
proceeding down the road pursued by a small dog
which made violent leaps for the “oont’s” tail. We
found that the scoundrelly Afghan driver had killed,
and probably eaten, our favorite eat, and with its
envelope had patched flic end of liis steed’s tail
where another friendly camel had bitten it.
(Continued on page 24.)
WE OF THE WANDERERS’ WAY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
For we are the sons of dreamers, given to strange
desires ;
The fires that burn by the roadway are ever our
altar fires.
Show us a star in the heavens, set it remotely far —
And that, of the countless millions, is' our own
beacon star!
Show us a tent and a tent-pole, not minding the
hessian fly,
And it’s us for the Road and the Distance, careless
of Whither and Why!
Waft us the fragrance of gum-leaves, burnt while
the billy boils.
And we shall move from our moorings; we shall
break from our toils.
Set us a task on the Borders, remote from the
warrens of man;
Send us the sounds of the creaking, dust-smothered
old wheels of a van;
Tell us the roads are uncharted; tell us the stages
are long;
And it’s us for the rollicking chorus of any old
vagabond song!
Tell us that dangers confront us; warn us of famine
and thirst;
Tell us the tracks we must fashion are sorrow- and
sickness-accurst;
Tell us these things to restrain us from leaving the
roof and the wall—
And the voice that you raise to withhold us is nought
but a challenging call.

Help to Make Australia Prosperous by using
MEGGITT’S LINSEED-OIL MEAL.
Pigs, calves, heifers, cows, horses and poultry thrive
on a daily ration of linseed-oil meal. It increases the
milking capacity and lifts the butter-fat test by One
Point.
At every show in Australia Meggitt meal-fed cattle
carry away all the prizes. Mr. H. McD. Livingstone,
Rosehill Farm, Kingaroy, at the 1916 show won
seven first prizes with a pen of calves and won the
three butter-fat tests with a pair of Meggitt Linseed-
oil meal-fed cows. All Stores, and

“Wal”: There is only one thing in life that
gets the indolent and unpleasant brown brother of
Papua into a sweat —the pursuit of food. Let every-
thing else in life wait—the women can do most of
the hard toil —but only whisper to the copper princes
that a lot of stomach ballast is around awaiting a
good home, and you will see them galvanised into a
working model of a “live wire.” Pursuing the evil-
doer and the unrighteous along the shores of the
Papuan Gulf during the months of April and May, I
have several times been a guest at the salaiferi festi-
val. Salaiferi is the Toaripi tribal name for the
giant mullet, a fish about 2ft. long, silver scaled and
spotted with large dots of brown along the sides, but
in every other respect similar to the ordinary mullet.
The last few days in April and the first days in May
these fish make their move towards the upper reaches
of the innumerable rivers to spawn, and brown
brother reaps a great harvest. For days before the
arrival of the fish the mouths of the rivers are
watched by the young boys and women of the tribe,
brown brother meanwhile mending nets, sharpening
spears and getting everything in readiness for the
excitement. Then, with the arrival of the first
schools, the fun begins ; everybody apparently going
mad with* the lust to kill. The fish come in millions,
the whole of the rivers being a packed mass of fish
fighting their way upstream, while canoes, spears,
HEART-BREAKING.
DOMAIN DOSSER : “Livin’ next door to yers
fer years, as you might say, I always
took an interest in you sailors. I re-
member the mornin’ yers sailed. There
yers teas all on deck with the signals
a-flying, an! the band struck up
'Jack’s the boy for work.’ It fair broke
me up.”
nets and swimming natives help themselves to the
horde. At the mouth of the Biaru I saw about a
thousand natives all toiling like fiends and making
the air shiver with their howls as they raked the fish
on shore. The river was boiling with the passage of
the myriads, and I only had to wade into the stream
and grab the fish with my hands to get enough for
my party’s requirements. I never thought so many
fish existed ; for three days the column of silver went
foaming up stream, and although tons and tons of
fish were lifted by the people it did not seem to
diminish the numbers passing. All the fish were in
roe —great masses of juicy eggs which Mrs. B.
Brother makes into a very soothing dish when mixed
with sago and grated cocoanut and baked in stone
ovens. . Fish are smoked and stored away for
future reference, and last for months. On the
return of the fish to the sea —about three weeks after
the arrival —another haul results, but there are
never so many captured as in the first fishing, nor
after spawning are they as pleasant to eat as when
in roe.
“Hay”: Has any abo.-entomologist ever
had an introduction to the jumping spider ? I have
only met one solitary specimen—in the north-west
corner of N. S. Wales. He was about two inches-
long and about one and a half across, and was on
the march when I came upon him. His thick, strong
legs were set right under his body like the legs of
a table, the two ’ back legs with a bend
resembling the hind legs of a grasshopper. When I
touched him with a stick he jumped six or seven
inches. As far as I could observe he only jumped
when annoyed. The fore part of his body was
covered with a black armor that shone like glass;
the rear half being lead-colored. He was armed
with a wicked-looking pair of pincers, made to fold
in close to his head and nearly out of sight, and
shot them out and closed them on my stick with an
audible snap.
“Eddyson”: The casual Australian once
more. When I was knocking about the mines in
the great days of the Madam Berry, now quite a
while ago, there was a picturesque old wind-driven
flour-mill in Clunes district (Vie.), giving that par-
ticular scrap of landscape a quaint Dutch aspect.
It stood on a rocky elevation beside the creek, and
its great arms almost swept the rock. The casual
party was a middle-aged heathen named Squires,
who had drifted into the township in quest of beer,
and was willing even to work for it if it was not
to be got in another way. Inch the miller
put Albert Squires on as a casual to lift
and carry and generally mess round, warn-
ing the man not to involve himself in a
spar with the sails, the last man who did sc
having put the officials at Creswick hospi-
tal to a fearful lot of trouble endeavor-
ing to restore his head to some remote
resemblance of its former self. Albert
paid no particular heed to the admoni-
tion, and on the second day, while on the
rock handling some sacks, he paused for a
moment to light his pipe, and, backing a
few involuntary steps to avoid the rude
attentions of Inch’s dog, suddenly felt
himself ripped from behind and then
snatched off his feet and lifted blithely
towards the blue sky. Albert Squires
went up, pipe in one hand, his still burn-
ing match in the other, and on his face
'an expression of no concern worth men-
tioning. The end of one arm of the wind-
mill had been splinted in a previous
encounter with a wayward dray. This
splintered scrap, having torn Albert’s
trousers, had taken a firm hold under his
belt, the back of his vest and the stout
straps of his leather apron, and was
hoisting him up and over. At the high-
est elevation the projecting iron on which
Albert Squires was suspended spiked
itself further up under his habiliments and
strap.s, and Albert started down again,
still with the pipe in his left, and the
lighted match in his right, and wearing
an expression of patient waiting. When Albert’s
feet were about 10 inches from the earth, he gently
slid off the arm, and was dropped in an erect posi-
tion, scathless and in his right mind, and then he
finished lighting his pipe!

“Ornit”: One of the most handsome
feathered exhibits in Bananaland Museum is the
Northern kingfisher. It was captured on the top of
Mt. Stanley range, New Guinea, by the Macgregor
expedition. Although only about the size of a
starling it has two feathers in the tail which measure
up to 9ft. Its home is in the dense forests of N.G. ;
and it refused to live and wag its amazing tail
feathers in Australia, though encouraged to do so by
well-meaning naturalists.
“Wandi”: I always noticed on farms that
where grain was long stored in the barn the mice
bred and multiplied and overran everything, but
when the barn was cleared there was no more
trouble. They breed in the fields, but very sparingly
compared to what they do where they have a big
store of grain. A somewhat similar plague to that which
is making things serious for the farmers at present
descended on Mulgalaixl in 1904, and for two or
three weeks hordes of the rodents raided several of
the northern N. S. Wales border towns. Something
less than a million were killed in a week at Ilurger-
ford. One storekeeper captured 1000 while ui load-
ing a waggon, and later the same evening killed
another 1000. The visitation revived memories of
the rat invasion of Queensland in 1886-7, when yarns
of swagmen being chased up trees, and of having
their boots eaten off while enjoying a siesta went
the rounds. Those beasts, by the way, appeared first
on the northern coast, whence they travelled about
200 miles inland, then disappeared as suddenly and
mysteriously as they had come.
“Ken”: After taking in a full cargo of
spirituous liquors at O’Donnell’s, the diminutive,
dust-smeared swagman zigzagged along to O’Mahony’s
Harp of Erin further down the main street. “Giv’sh
longesh beer (hie) you got, bosh, for a tray,” he
demanded, clutching the counter for support. “Git
out wid ye, it’s O’Donnell’s firewater ye’re dhrunk
on,” roared 16st. O’Mahony. “Drunk, am I, bosh?”
queried the pedestrian. “Well, t’ell wizh you, an’
(hie) t’ell wizh Ireland,” and a couple of dead
marines flew around O’Mahony’s bald head. Then
events occurred with sufficient rapidity to beat a
moving-picture camera, and two minutes later the
curser of the Green Isle struck the floor of Con-
stable Brady’s log cell, feeling very much like a
recent accident. Court day was race day, and the
case of Rex v. Matilda’s owner was last on the list.
Brady whispered to the prisoner as he led him into
court: “First race starts in 15 minutes, and Micky
Doran on the bench has a horse runnin’. Plead
guilty, and there’ll be no evidence called, and it’ll
be the risin’ of the Court for you.” “Guilty, yer
Honor, it’s sorry I am, an’ God save Ireland,” whined
the accused. Micky Doran, J.P., grabbed his hat,
A HARD NUT.
THE GROCER : “And how is Pat, Mrs.
Casey?”
MRS. CASEY: “Share, an ’ he’s foine!”
THE GROCER: “He hasn’t been knocked out
yet?”
MRS. CASEY: “Phwat! O’id loike to see the
German spalpeens that could knock Pat
Casey out. Begorra, an’ it’s more than
Oi can do myself.”
and leaning over the bench shook a huge, freckled
fist at the prisoner. “Ye dhirty little hypocrite,” he
snapped. “Ye thought it’d be the risin’ of the
Court, did ye! Well, me clever bhoy, O’Mahony
gave me his evidence last night, and it’s 48 hours
for ye in Brady’s cell, ye insultin’ little worm. And,
by the same token, and the grace of God, it’s lynched
ye’ll be if Doran’s mare don’t win the Cup to-day.
Now be off wid ye, and pray for your soul.”
THE RETREAT.
REGISTRAR (taking particulars ): “What
time was the first child'horn?”
FATHER (registering birth of triplets): “Two
o’clock!”
REGISTRAR; “And the second?”
Father: “Two-fifteen!"
REGISTRAR: “And the third?”
FATHER : “Oh, Heaven knows —I cleared
out!”
“F.E.M.”: Allow me to introduce the
edible tree-grub, which if war conditions become
harder may perhaps find a place on the family table
in lieu of boiled bull, or as tripe and onions. Armed
with tomahawks and thin wire hooks, I often lured
him' from his woody nest. The big white larva
grows up fi;om an egg deposited on the bark of gums
by a butterfly commonly known as the “King George”
(though this name belies its sex), and it eats its
way into the wood. The bark dust denotes the'
presence of the dainty, and a few chops does the
rest. Place the grub on the coals. It blisters and
stiffens out, and when a fatty smell arises take it
off and tell me if you don’t like it.
“Edw.”: A very rare bird, the yellow-
parrot,’ or “Murray smoker” ( Platycercus flaveolus),
appears occasionally on the Monaro (N.S.W.) plains.
Writer has seen the bird there flying and feeding
in company with a flock of rosellas,. but always
singly. The general coloring of this handsome parrot
is canary-yellow, with pale blue wings and a scarlet
patch on the forehead. The Monaro visitor was
known locally- as the white rosella, and suspected to
be an albino or freak example of the rosella family.
Even in its home in the'forests along the Murray
River the yellow parrot is very rare. Another rare
parrot is the green leek, or superb parrot, a harmony
in bluish-green, deep yellow and scarlet. I have
met with this bird occasionally in small flocks
on South Coast, N.S.W., passing over clear ground
from one forest to another. The common green, or
swift parrot, which feeds on honey appears on the
South Coast in summer in flocks and is very often
styled “green leek,” though the real Simon Pure is
a very different bird. •
“F.J.D.”: Can any traveller, with per-
sonal experience of the method, tell me why the
Yankee plan of carrying one’s worldly possessions by
means of two shoulder-straps does not find favor
with the Australian Knights of the Road? Is
Matilda a purely Australian production ?
THE SECRET.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I sought a sage the other day—
His white beard almost reached the ground—
And spoke him: “Sage, point me the way
That Happiness is to be found ;
Of realms Elysian I dream,
Where Truth and Beauty reign supreme.”’
“Tell me the books that I must read,
Show me the things that I must do
To win of happiness my meed ;
The secret, sage, I crave of you.”
The sage a moment paused to think,
Then murmured, “Comeanaveadrink ! ”

HOOFS IN THE NIGHT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I hate the rude honk of the motor,
.The clanging of trams in the street,
The rattle of cabs with lean horses,
The pavemented patter of feet.
I loathe the harsh noises of cities ;
But I know of a tireless delight—
The gallop and echo, the gallop and echo
Of hoofs beating home in the night.
The gum-scented tracks of the bushland
And hoofs beating home in the night.
I have listened to plashing of waters
Where ships in their swiftness are proud,
To aeroplanes whizzing and whirring
Far up in the sun-dazzled cloud ;
And many the sounds of man’s travel,
But dearest the iron-shod flight,
The clatter and echo, the clatter and echo
Of hoofs beating home in the night—
The dimly-seen lights of the homestead
And hoofs beating home in the night.
Oh, sweet is the music of showers
On lands that are red with the drought,
And sad is the tramping of soldiers
Who pass to black havoc and rout;
But glad is the rhythmical cadence,
When stars glimmer naked and white,
The gallop and echo, the gallop and echo,
The clatter and echo, the clatter and echo
Of hoofs beating home in the night—.
The tree-shadowed ways of the bushland
And hoofs beating home in the night.

The Majority of Australian
Motorists
are not likely to err in the selection of the tyres they use. Many have tried
various makes, experience has demonstrated the best and most economical
tyres to use —the result being that every second car and every second
motor cycle on Australian roads is shod with the White Tread
DUNLOP TYRES
and the number is growing daily. This means that as many Dunlops are
used as all the other makes put together. WHY ? Ask a Dunlop user
and he will give you several reasons—we give you two: —
Reasonable first cost —and eventual lowest running cost.
Durability—built up on a foundation of the highest
quality of materials and scientific construction.
add to these the fact that the White Tread Dunlop is one of the highest
grade tyres made in the world —that it is specially constructed and gives
high mileage under Australian conditions, and is gaining additional supporters
every day, and you have sufficient grounds to fit Australian Dunlops, to test
their wearing qualities and realise how economical the present day Dunlop
is. Never mind what previous experience you have had with any make of
Tyre. Test the White Tread Dunlop and
note the result—that will suffice.

“Dunlops undoubtedly
offer you advantages
over any imported
tyre —why not benefit
by using them ?

Great drama, in :i parts, of a poignancy interest,
assisting with anguish at the terrible peripeties of
a Young Giri, falling in hand, of Bohemian bandits.
Pictures of this film are celieious, being taken at
fir trees and mountan’s of the Alpes.—Great success.
“Bluebeard” : “The Glad Eye” lias mostly
gone to the war. Ethel Dane (KikiJ was
lately in New York, but husband Cyrii
Keightley was off to the trenches. Tommy
Shelford, the slender comedian, is in France
as a second lieut. of Field Artillery, and his
brother-comedian, the plump Henry J. Ford,
is at Malta, In the Garrison Artillery.
“C. Ockney” ; Just-dead ,T. N. Maslcelyne,
England’s best-known “magician,” was with
his partner Cooke the first to run a prac-
tically continuous show in London. At
Maskclyne and Cooke’s original pitch—tin*
Egyptian Hall. Piccadilly—two performances
daily were given for a score of years.
‘ England’s Home of Mystery,” as the place
w;\s christened, became as well known and
as largely patronised as the Zoo and Madame
Tussaud’s Waxworks. When the Piccadilly
lease fell in. Maskclyne carried on at St.
George’s Hall, Langham Place, hard by
Regent Circus, where, in spite of the oppo-
sition of continuous pictures, he gave his
daily double performance to paying audi-
ences. The old conjurer was nearly 78 when
he went to solve the great mystery.
“Minim”: ‘The libretto of “The White
Chrysanthemum,” the second venture of the
Taits in song-and-dance, is by Leedham
Bantock, a brother of the J.C.W. heavy-
weight; the music by Howard Talbot, who
hatched “I’ve Cotter Motter.” The- same
pair were responsible for the attractive
“Belle of Brittany,” which Clarke and
Meynell staged.
“S.S.”: At a Melbourne suburban picture-
show the other Saturday evening the place
was packed with hot, damp people in out of
a wet night, their cheap, furs as odorous
as an active tannery. Next on my left were
two little girls, 12 and 14, I judged. The
chief, item on the suspended bed-sheet was
a long, tiresome, moral drama intended to
lead people from wickedness by representing
vice in 700-guinea furs, its hands studded
with diamonds, demolishing endless cham-
pagne in gilded halls, amid innumerable
adoring young men of inconceivable beauty
in spotless evening suits, and with waists
like a beauty of the Pompadour period.
’W hen it was all over, said little Miss Twelve
on my left .to Miss Fourteen: “Well, did you

‘But I don’t think children should be per-

Madge Titheradge has made such a hit as
principal boy in the Drury Lane panto..
"Puss in Boots,” that Arthur Collins has
secured her for the same role in the next
Christmas production, which he believes will
be a new version of “Aladdin.”
■‘Floater”; A new repertory organisation
in London called the Stockpot Club is pre-
paring to supply Purple Pills for Pale Souls
on Sabbath afternoons. The signboard of
the concern hangs out at the Margaret
Morris Theatre, Chelsea; and if you dodge
the submarine you c-an take a helping of
Strindberg, Shaw and similar heretics under
the chpable guidance of Norman Page, the
bright young actor who was the Cat in the
Australian production of “The Blue Bird"
and who subsequently played one of the
dreadful twins in Shaw’s “You Never Can
Tell” at Melbourne Royal.
“C. Ockney”: At least half a dozen of the
leading West End London theatres are run
these days by Alfred Butt. He not only
controls the huge variety houses, the t*alace
in Shaftesbury Avenue and the Empire in
Leicester Square, but also has the Adelphi
and Gaiety and other equally well-known
establishments where more or less “legiti-
mate” plays are produced. He is also
“nursing” a constituency with the object of
standing for Parliament, and has just lately
accepted a job of assisting Lord Devonport
in the food-rationing scheme. His qualifica-
tion for this post lies principally in the fact
that in his young days he was an assistant
in Harrod’s Stores, one of London’s biggest
emporiums.
Business, Robbery, etc.
“Padjiul” : F.M.G. Webster wants to save
money. All right. There are eight or nine
public holidays in the year, and under the
present system each officer of the Depart-
ment gets either the full day off or, if he is
kept on duty, extra payment for the time
worked. As the postmen have to attend to
make the usual first delivery and the morn-
ing telegraph rush keeps all operators busy
for some hours, the result is that these holi-
days are as expensive as full working days.
A simpler idea would he to hulk Sunday and
holiday time, and, instead of paying extra
for it, grant an additional week’s leave per
annum, to be tacked on to the usual yearly
holiday. A similar scheme, differing only
in that it covers all kinds of overtime, was
some time ago introduced in the Navy Wire-
less Branch without undue atmospheric dis-
turbance.

“F.C.”: “Lahma’s” tale (B. 17/5/T7) of
his taste of the real• navy tobacco reminds
me of the days when I helped to push a
tramp across the earth. We could always
buy the navy “rolls” from the bumboatmen
of Malta and The Bock—dark, torpedo-
shaped things a foot long, with a delicious
flavor. “Lahma’s” mention of the tea-sprink-
ling is right, and a Maltese providore put us
up to another wrinkle. Get a box of decent
cigars (ss. 6d. per 100, duty free, then),
put them into two boxes, 50 in each, pack
full with tea and stow in a damp place for
a month. Then you’ll think you’re smoking
the finest Ilabana (15s. a box there).
“Peg-Leg”: “D.” (B. 24/5/T7) libels
bunny when he gets on to the subject of
furs. From my own experience—or rather
my wife’s —a good cold-climate rabbit-skin
will outlast musquash or the stuff they sell
as coney seal. Out of a rabbit-skin coat
costing £7 she got two seasons’ wear; out
of a £2O musquash, only one season’s. No
coney or musquash is a patch on rabbit,
dyed black, in the matter of appearance.
The same view is now held by a once-scorn-
ful female relation who returned from
U.S.A. gushing over a beautiful “sealskin
coat which cost every penny of £52 over
there.” It was bunny, back again after a
hair-cut and a black dip!
*** f \ *
“0.K.” dreams a dream of fat rabbits: —
The Victorian Price Fixing Board has decided that
the rabbit is a national asset. And so it might be
it it were properly dealt with. The right place for
rabbits are Government preserves on Crown lands.
Everywhere else the skin-getters should have every
inducement to ply their murderous trade. The
bunny of Australia should be raised to the dignity
of the Ostend rabbit, so well and favorably known to
Britain. The plump, white-fleshed rabbit that
London eats is not a wild animal, but a delicacy
raised in c'aptivity. Australia shows no more intelli-
gent appreciation of its rabbit than of its timber.
Unlicensed productiveness spells destructiveness, but
if restricted to Government breeding-farms the little
beast would indeed be worth while. Its flesh would
be more nutritious and in greater demand, and by
fixing a moderate price for it the Government would
be practicaly legislating against the bloated butchers'
meat-trusf.
“X.Y.” Superphosphate can only be
used without waste on certain soils. For
land rich in organic matter, or inclined to be
sour, ground phosphate rock, at half the
price, is more efficient. A ton of ground
phosphatic rock costs, say, £3 and contains
25 p.c. of phosphoric acid. A ton of super-
phosphate from the same grade of rock
would cost £O, and contain only 14 p.c. of
phosphoric acid. On a suitable soil the
latter would be more assimilable, but only on
a suitable soil. On the other band, if raw
ground phosphate be applied to soil of a
limey or chalky nature, very little return
will be' obtained from it. The farmer who
uses “super” in quantity should communi-
cate with the Agricultural Dept, for advice,
and, in addition, would do well to try the
two forms of phosphate on his own soil,
under similar conditions. -

“D.F.”: As far back as 180<>, when Gover-
nor King made out a list of the non-iudige-
nous plants growing in N. S. Wales, the sweet
briar was “in plenty.” Furze was just get-
ting a start; it had been raised from seed in
1801. Present-day gardeners would not know
a lot of King’s species. His potatoes were
the O’Xoble, Champion. Blue and Small
Kidney, and amongst his flowers were love
lies bleeding, balm of gilead- and bladder
ketmia. One of his turnips was the Buta
Baga, and there was a horse-’Taddisli” of
the same name. Amongst the apples that he
says he would like to have are the "Juneat-
ing." the Pomeroy, the Stubbard. the Jersey
and the Yining.

“Bad Australian” from the other side of
the Pacific
A few days ago the first unit of a new line of
Yankee steamships arrived in Buenos Aires with a
full bill of passengers, the usual cargo of “notions”
and several million dollars in gold. A number of
Heavy shipments of gold have reached Buenos Aires
firms since the war began; but the Yanks have now
established a bank to deal direct with the public,
like the English, French, Italians and Germans.
They have also taken over a great amount in rail-
road securities. They control the meat business, and
have gone in largely for cattle-raising and timber
lands in the Argentine and Paraguay.
But the Jap is also beginning to loom up large in
■ these parts, and unlike the Yank, who is mostly a
nomadic commercial agent, he finds the land to his
liking, and settles down permanently. The Japs
have already established themselves in the North,
and are rapidly taking hold of all kinds of business.
In Peru there are about 50,000 or 00,000 of these
people, and since the inauguration of their own line
of steamships to Valparaiso a steadily-increasing
stream of immigration has been spreading itself over
the Southern Republics.
In a few months the existing Japanese-South
American line of steamships will be extended to
Buenos Aires via Cape Horn, and another fleet is
shortly to be put in commission to run from Japan
to Buenos Aires and Rio de Janeiro by the Atlantic
route. Then will begin a hard fight between the Jap
and the Yank for commercial supremacy in S.
America.

‘‘Clcricus”; Amalgamation between the
two Clerks’ Unions in N. S. Wales lias been
consummated at lust. While both Unions
have given away a lot ami the terms of
amalgamation are not nil that could
be. desired by at least one party, yet
the end, consolidation of forces, has been
achieved. The old United Clerks’ Union,
with a reputed membership of 2400. and the
young Federated Clerks’ Union, with a roll
o! 1000, should between them make the
foundation of the biggest union in the
.State. And certainly no class of men and
women need a union—and a militant one —
more.
**# * .
In a Bourke-street window
Landscape for Sale—Lifesizu.
One of the “liyest” unions in Melbourne
is that of the Undertakers’ Assistants. Every
now and again, when the concern observes
some tendency on the part of the crape-
hound boss to act as though the members’
fighting instincts were dead, it gets out its
old, bold motto, “Why live a unionist and be
buried by a non-unionist?”- A large pro-
portion of Melbourne funerals start from
the homes of unionists, so the boss has to
step very lightly indeed. The brotherhood
of the bier has just issued an up-to-date
black-edged white list, and its message of
peace-if-yo U-want-it and good-wages to men
is being circulated as widely as posible.
“Quldam”: There is joy at Grafton
(N.S.W.) over the fact that the U.S.A.
are obtaining ironbark logs from that
district to work up into gun-carriages
lor use on warships. Merely another
proof of tlie rare value of ' our pro-
ducts. Yet, though conservation of forests
hgs boon a nolitical plank since the year one,
it would be instructive to learn how much
valuable Australian forest has been de-
stroyed in proportion to that conserved. On
present appearances, by the time we learn
to really appreciate ironbark. we shall have
to import it, as we do wattlebark.

“Bad Australian”: Quite a flourishing
business is done in Paraguay in the extrac-
tion of the, essential oil of the “apeypu” or
bitter orange. The oil is obtained by distil-
lation from the leaves, green oranges and
rind of the ripe fruit. Every Paraguayan
cocky of any account has a still for making
cana and extracting this oil. The leaves are
harvested by lopping the smaller branches
only so that production is continuous at in-
tervals of two or three years, according to
the seasons. It usually takes about 250
kilos of leaves to make one kilo of oil. This
is worth about 355. or Ids. to the man in the
bush; but, judging by the attention the
exporter pays to the business, there must
be very big profits in it somewhere. I
believe that the cultivation of the Para-
guayan bitter orange and extraction of its
essential oil would be a useful side-line for
Australian cane-growers. The stock is very
hardy and thrives wonderfully, with little or
no attention, wherever sugar can be grown.
►Should any Bulletin reader care to try the
experiment, I am authorised to say that Mr.
Wm. Wood, of Colonia Cosme, via Caazapa,
Paraguay, will be pleased to help the good
work along by supplying selected seed free of
chai’ge on application.
A CHANGE OF FRONT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I've hebl for years, without surcease,
The trenches in the rear;
Have grown the cabbages of peace,
And kept the paddock clear .
Of noxious bills and other ills—
Weeds that,toil's fruit will stunt;
And now I’m casting sordid care—
I'm going to the Front!
I've chopped the wood of constant toil
The fire of duty burns
To keep the kettle on the boil;
And, now, my spirit yearns
To go away on holiday,
And ease me of the brunt
Of cowyard sweats, and woes and cares—•
I'm going to the Front!
Let those who love it stay in peace,
And keep the chickhns fed,
And count the eggs and shoo tlie geese,
And put the pig to bed.
Though I was bound, my freedom’s found
(Tlie war’s a bonzer stunt!),
I leave the cojvvard for a while —
I'm going to the Front!
My heart -is lilting in its song.
I’m dodging every bill;
Tlie constant raids and charges strong
Of men 1 dared not kill.
While round tlie back, upon my track,
Dull tradesmen still may grunt,
My children, now, with truth can say:
“Oh, father’s at the Front!”
x.s.w.

THE THOUGHT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I knew a man who had a thought
And sold it for a shilling.
(Had it been sixpence, care-distraught,
To sell he had been willing.)
He sold it for a shilling to
A certain Mr. Boodle, who
Snaps other fellows’ thought as curs
That no morality deters
Will snap a good dog’s bone.
And Mr. Boodle took the thought
(He had none of his own)
That was fastidiously wrought
Of golden dream and silvern wit,
And straightway dazzled crowds with it,
While every clown cried out, “Indeed,
This Boodle is the man we need!”
A sale's a sale. Sales will not cease
While Boodles gabble and increase.
There is no moral to this piece.
N.S.W.

THE USHER'S LAMENT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The usher leaned upon the rail.
Said he: “What-o! AVhat do you think?
See ’Enry spring from off his tail!
He calls that actin’. Fair the dink,
He calls it actin’ 1 ’Scuse me mirth,
But, ’struth, I’d haet him off the hearth!
“ 'Ow do they get their names up, Ned ?
’Ow do they do it? Here is me
Could do ’em double on me ’ead,
’X’ ’ere I’m stuck an usher, see.
They come ,’n’ go. Some short ’n’ quick,
But ’ere is me, ’n’ ’ere I stick.
“I stand around ’n’ see ’em pout,
’N’ each guy chirp his little chunk,
’N’ soft ’n’ low I count ’em out,
’N’ then they up ’n’ does a bunk.
Well I should smile! This little lot
Don’t know ez much ez I’ve forgot.
“Just pipe his nibs. ’E calls that hart! .
He’s new to buskin'. ’Ell! who cares?
Gorstruth, ’ow would / act that part?
’N’ I’ve been here these fifteen years.
But, son, experience (more’s the shame)
Don’t count fer nothin’ in this game!”

The Clock was famous for
its accuracy, and, in olden

“I\/TILES OF AVON ” tours London and gives en route some little-
-IVI known particulars of famous places in the Heart of the Empire.
It is interesting to know that the War Office of to-day is situated
almost opposite the Horse Guards and has requisitioned huge supplies
of strong, enduring and dependable AVON TYRES ever since the
outbreak of war. And, although hundreds of Avon employees are
now in the firing line proving the “ mettle of their pasture,”
the supplies of Avon Tyres are fully maintained by their
comrades and are helping the Allies along the road to Victory.

POLITICAL
POINTS
So far it has been taken for granted that
the farmer must stand the racket of all the
tremendous loss of grain through the mice
plague. But why should he? The wheat was
vaguely commandeered by the Commonwealth
Government and sold to the British Govern-
ment. The farmer had no say in the matter,
lie delivered the grain at the railway
station, and that was the end of it so far as
he was concerned. It was out of his custody
altogether. Why should he have to stand
the racket for the shameful neglect of the
wheat after he had no longer control over
it? If it wasn’t the farmer that was con-
cerned no Government would dream of sug-
gesting such an injustice. It only makes the
movement from the land all the more cer-
tain at a time when the Governments arc
struggling to get people on the land.
HIS EARLY TRAINING.
“Look heah! I sent for you several times
this morning. You never seem to he
about when you're wanted. What were
you before you enlisted?"
“Policeman, sir."
New motto for the freetrade Fusion: Win
the war —and starve the warriors !
The recent general # election ought to be
the death warrant of the Senate as at pre-
sent constituted. Equal representation of
the States is only defensible on the ground
that the Senate is the guardian of State
rights. But the rights of the States are
not mentioned in a Senate election cam-
paign nowadays. The same two organisa-
tions run the Senate candidates in all the
States —clear proof that State rights are
not an issue at all. This being so, the
Senate is an anomaly and an undemocratic
excrescence in which one Australian electoi
in one part has as much say as 20 others in
another part on the question whether (tor
instance) Hughes should be permitted to
win the war or not. The Senate’s shape
must be changed or it must go.
The good talk of Bigjohn Forrest to the
Australasian Methodist Conference, which
wanted the Commonwealth Government to
use the War Precautions Act to prohibit
“shouting” :
It seemed to him that the deputation which urged
Government action on the grounds of democracy
believed not in democracy, but in despotism, rhev
did not want the rule of the State, but rather of a
despotic Prime Minister or a despotic Federal Min-
istry. .. .If that principle were to be accepted, the
War Precautions Act might some day be used in a

SLAPIN : “Say, Tommy, why do you always
make your wife take an umbrella out
with her?"
CLAPIN : " Well, you see, if it came on to
rain and she hadn't an umbrella she
might go into some shop for shelter!"
The incurable S. M. Herald said last
week, in the preface to a leader: —
It is remarkable how rapidly the people’s savings
are increasing despite the war.
Followed half a column of self-satisfied
purring because Australian savings banks
deposits are climbing at the rate of three-
quarters of a million a month and have
passed 90 millions. ' If the S. M. Herald
got the loan of a million from the Bank oi
N. S. Wales and tlropped it into the Com-
mercial of Sydney, it might just as sensibly
say that it was remarkable how rapidly its "
deposits were increasing despite the vast
sums it was borrowing.
The Federal Taxation Department has
thus far taken no visible steps to upset the
decision that, owing to a technical flaw, State
public servants are not liable to pay Federal
income tax. Victoria, anxious to do the square
thing, passed an Act compelling that State’s
service to pay, but Premier Holman was not
game to antagonise the N. S. Wales service
vote just prior to an election by providing
for the same simple justice in the Ma State.
And it is simple justice. To even hint that
the “sovereign rights” •of the States are
affected by the Federal taxation of the State’s
servants is as ridiculous as it would be to
hint that they are affected by the municipals
ties taxing them in return for performing
some other service.
“F.C.” : Toy-making is an eminently suit-
able occupation for partially disabled men;
yet the Vic. State War Council will send no
more to the Collingwood School to be taught,
because they can’t find jobs for all the few
who have already been instructed. And they
are not likely to while the shops are full of
American, Japanese, “Swedish” and
toys, which will be as long as the Fusion
bluffs Australia out of an adequate tariff.
From the press gallery at Westminster: —
As soon as The Bulletin’s London contributor,
.1. F. Hogan, was elected a member of the House of
Commons he began agitating for facilities for his
old chums of the Overseas Press to be present and
take notes on occasions of Imperial interest. After
stupid and considerable delay this simple concession
has arrived at last. At the opening of the third war
session by the King the other day the official repre-
sentatives of the Australian and Maoriland press
were given seats in the Press Gallery at the House
of Lords, and it is authoritatively announced that
they will be similarly accommodated in the Commons
Gallery when subjects of Imperial interest are under
discussion.
According to the Minister for Education
only one youngster in seven who leaves the
X. S. Wales State schools makes for a trade.
This condition of things is said to be the
bad result of arbitration awards which
unduly limit the proportion of apprentices.
That proportion, no doubt, has been-very
selfishly and short-sightedly brought too
low. 'But quite as powerful a reason
whv so few lads go in for skilled
trades is that in Australia there is
not nearly enough difference between the
pay of skilled and unskilled workmen, rhe
wliollv unskilled lad of 19 can get a man s
full wages, and they are generally only two
or three shillings less than those of the
highlv-skilled tradesman who has put m a
long and poorly-paid apprenticeship. lhe
practice of paying the unskilled man too
much and the skilled man too little, tills the
country with drifters, and keeps it at its
primitive wood-and-water-joey occupations.
Notley Moore, P.M., has had a testimonial
offered him bv the Argus. Melbourne still
allows the honorary Jay to sit on its subur-
ban benches alongside the. stipendiary, and
sometimes the trained administrator is over-
ruled by the amateur. This happened the
other day to Moore at Port Melbourne, and
the Argus at once declared that the stipe
“would be more likely to be right than the
honorary justices.” In fact. Grandmamma
was so affected bv the absurd spectacle that
she suddenly tore up the traditions of a life-
time and trampled on them with both elastic-
sides. Thus: —•
Honorary justices on the bench in a city, of the
importance of Melbourne are an anachronism.
So they are; but if'any serious Parliament-
ary proposal were brought' forward for their
extinction, Grandma would handsomely
admit that her wild words had been uttered
in haste, and that the time not yet ripe.
The purchase of the business of the Union
S.S. Co. by -the P. and O. Co. will bring
along changes in Maoriland. Two-thirds of
all the Ricketty Islanders have long felt that
connection between the North and the South
shouldn’t depend wholly upon a private co.;
but as it was the co. of which M.L. is
prouder than any other, matters were
allowed to slide —especially as ' the miners
in the State collieries showed that State
servants are just as liable to go on strike
and upset public services as anybody else.
But if a foreign owner takes over the Union
lines, then before long there will certainly be
a State “ferry” between Wellington and
Lyttelton, connecting North and South
Islands.
Recently, in Sydney, there was a meeting
of delegates representing, it was alleged.
250,000 public servants. The object, it was
further alleged, was to establish a militant
political union, the idea being that the
250,000 should sell a block vote to which-
ever party makes the highest bid. Follow-
ing this announcement came protests and
then disclaimers. Yet why throw any
specially-heavy bricks at the organisers
of this new militant body of vote-
sellers? It isn’t the vote-sellers who are
most to blame. It is the vote-purchasers;
and so long as there are two big machine-
made parties bidding for place and pay, there
are bound to be bodies prepared to throw in
on one side or the other for a consideration.
It is no use howling about the indecency of
it. The receiver makes the thief. We must
get rid of the receiver—in this case the party
system.
Two years late, the Argus begins to howl
about the grave injustice that is being done
to Australian officers who go to the Front
and, on returning, find themselves junior to
rapidly-promoted men who have stayed com-
fortably at home. For instance :
Brigadier-General Forsyth returned to Australia
full of honors. Before going to the war he held the
office of temporary quartermaster-general, with a seat
on the Military Board, and was for some considerable
time director of equipment. How was his service at
the Front rewarded? Instead of returning to his
former duties and becoming quartermaster-general, he
was practically shelved by being given the South
Australian command, and Brigadier-General Stanley,
who was brought from the retired list to take the
place of Brigadier-General Forsyth when he went to
the Front, has been retained as quartermaster-
general.
And Foster, the R.E. Colonel who was pitch-
forked into the tremendously important posi-
tion of chief of staff, is still there, though it
is promised that Legge, who has been at the
Front, shall succeed him at the end of June.
Apart from that, the practice of the Depart-
ment is prejudicial to recruiting. A colonel
who stays safely at home and is promoted to
General for telling Pearce that he is a genius
remains a General. But a colonel who
carries his life to the Front and on
the field does military work which
wins him promotion to General, is only
a colonel when he returns to the Aus-
tralian home forces. Of course, there are
men who haven’t been kept at home to tell
Pearce that he is a genius; but that isn’t the
sort that has won much promotion.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Federal and State Governments could not go
indefinitelv dipping pitchers into the same well.”
■—Joe Cook.
Into the same old well, year in, year out,
We dipped the bucket with a joyous splash.
\ multitude of things we talked about,
But fortune hung upon the one word—cash.
'With it our hearts were bold, our hopes were stout;
Without it place and party went to smash.
Men talked of some provision large and sound
For the wet day that threatened us and ours.
We smiled and the ready moisture round
To irrigate our cabbages and flowers.
The well was deep and sweet in Cohen’s ground,
Fed with strong springs and lucky passing showers.
Then with tile roaring of the battle gun
A scorching wind blew over land and sea.
We kept the ancient bucket on the run,
Still splashing liquid joyously and free;
For win-the-war must mean, when all was done,
Swilling the wetness to infinity.
But now a heavy doubt assails our hope.
The waters from the shining mouth recede.
We needs must rig a windlass and a rope
And dip far down to fill our cups with speed ;
And later, ere the waters all elope,
Only a deep-set pump may match our need.
i ierce grows the drought. War’s hot sun sears the
ground
And blazes in a hell of tortured sky.
Vainly the state of matters we expound;
The cabbage withers and the roses die.
And last of all, for lack of one poor pound,
Statecraft upends the hole and finds it dry.

The public are not pressed to buy Dr. Morse’s Indian
Root Pills because they are an All-British product, neither
are they urged to buy them because for the past fifteen
years they have been manufactured entirely in Australia. These are mo doubt veiy good
reasons why they should be urged on the attention of the public, but there is a far better one which
is the quality Of the arffolo. It is on the merits of Dr. Morses Indian Root Pills alone that
they are presented to the public for their approval, and not because they are made in Australia or
are British-owned or any other reason, however good it may be. They stand purely on .their
merits as an effective remedy for all complaints arising from a disordered digestion, and they are
to-dav more extensively used by all classes of the community than any othei remedy sold in
Australia. All classes of the community use them, male and female, rich and poor, young and
old The merchant, the miner, the lady ol society and the girl in the factory- they all find in this
remedy just what is required to keep the system in proper working order. Indigestion and
Constipation caused by improper or too much food or drink are quickly banished by a dose or
two of Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills. They are a safe, sure and reliable remedy
sold at a moderate price within the reach of all classes.
COMSTOCK’S “DEAD-SHOT” WORM
PELLETS.
A SAFE, SURE, AND RELIABLE SPECIFIC FOIL
THE ERADICATION OF WORMS IN CHILDREN
AND ADULTS.
The general , symptoms of worms are a
tendency to pick the nose and a sensation of
itching in the anus. Other symptoms are
nervous affections, such as fretfulness, irri-
tation of temper, wakefulness or disposition,
to excessive sleep, disturbed sleep, and grind-
ing the teeth, sudden starting out of sleep as
if from fright, dizziness, spasmodic move-
ments of the eyelids, dilated pupils, per-
verted vision, temporary blindness and deaf-
ness. General convulsions are not infre-
quent in children, and symptoms resembling
water in the head have been ascribed to
worms, and have ceased on their expulsion.
The long round or stomach worm is the
commonest kind of worm from which man-
kind suffers, and is of a light, transparent
color, resembling the ordinary ground worm,
except that the extremities are more sharply
pointed than the ground worm.
Young people are more subject to these
worms than middle-aged or elderly people.
They live in the bowels, and sometimes make,
their way into the stomach and throat, caus-
ing sickness, vomiting, and choking- Gener-
ally one or two would be the most a person
would be afflicted with, but sometimes a
much larger number is met with. The length
varies from four to eight inches, but young
ones an inch to two inches long are also
found. The first thing to do is to rid the
system of the worms, and Comstock’s “Dead
Shot” Worm Pellets, taken according to
directions, are an effective remedy for the
thorough eradication of the long round or
stomach worm-the common enemy of the
child, the youth, the middle-aged and aged,
A light, nourishing diet, out-of-door exercise,
and, if possible, a change of air, will greatly
improve the general health.
Threadworms or pinworms are of very
common occurrence in children. They are
very small, from one-sixtli of an inch to half-
: 1 •’ nrui roam-nhlfN cotton
an-inch n length, and lescmblo cotton
thread—-they are sometimes called seat
worms, and reside in the lower bowels. .The
chief symptom of this worm is severe local
itching, restlessness and irritability, and a
frequent desire to urinate, picking at the
nose; loss of appetite and amemia a* atoo
observed. To get rid of the worms and then
eggs their nests also must be remold, ami
that requires a specific remedy Comstock
“Dead Shot” Worm Pellets, taken according
to directions, on an empty stomach, followed
by a, dose of opening medicine, will succeed
where others fail.
Comstock’s “Dead Shot” Worm Pellets are
packed ip glass tubes, with full directions in
each,-and are for sale by chemists and stores
generally at 3s. 6d. per packet, or six packets
for 205., and if unable to obtain locally will

The totalisator house at Randwick is
steadily moving up, and unless something happens
out of its turn the machinery will be working at
Tattersall’s meeting in September. This should be a
sort of rehearsal for the Epsom and Derby meeting
of the A.J.C., and by then the public will be
entitled to expect an exhibition of totalisator-work-
in.g on a basis of reasonable efficiency. As it hap-
pens, the A.J.C., unlike some other clubs, has no
particular reason for wishing to see the machine
biAiught into disrepute—on the Randwick course, at
any rate. Yet, although there is frequent evidence
that the alleged purposes for which the machine was
legalised are not being realised—indeed, the instru-
ment is on some courses inviting the loud bray of
derision —nothing is heard from the Government
except a few mild remarks of regret. Apparently
Ministers imagine they improve matters by talk.
The first thing for the Government to do, if it ever
approaches the matter seriously, is to get a grip of
the fact that the hostility of most clubs to the
machine is an important factor in producing chaos;
further, that many clubs have good, sound reason
for being angry. The 7 per cent, and 3 per cent,
share of the commission and the existence of Moses
are the crux of the entire business or farce, or
whatever it may he. If these are continued, then
for every reason anyone may have for expecting the
machine to. justify itself there will be 764 for
anticipating the other thing.
* * * »
Anything like good totalisator manage-
ment at Randwick will give the place fielders one
where they deserve to get it. For that, at any rate,
there will be rejoicing, and not among the smaller
punters only. Apparently the place merchants have
decided to get all that is available, and are betting
on a scale that can only be explained by assuming
the public to be quite mad. In one race on Satur-
day there was a horse some of the place fielders
would not lay at all; one or two offered to take
3 to 1 against him. About the 17 other starters
even money was available concerning half a dozen,
6 to 4 on as many more, and 2 to 1 the rest. One
notorious cramper was betting evens about the lot.
When the writer of this par declined the offer against
a prad which the straight-out fielders were anxious to
lay at 12’s and 15’s, the pirate offered 6 to 4 as a
favor. The 1-2 machine ought to stop the public
doing business on suicide principles, anyhow.
* * * *
Apparently the A.J.C. reckons either that
there is something wrong about giving the jumping
horse much encouragement or that the local animal
is no class, and is provided for as much as he
deserves to be. At the Club’s Winter or Steeple-
chase meeting there are a couple of hurdle races
and two events over brush fences. The rest of the
proceedings are carried out by “novices” and two-
year-olds and the ordinary crowd of handicap nags
catered for every week on suburban and other tracks
and at frequent meetings during the year by the
A.J.C. itself. Viewed as an ordinary meeting there
is, of course, nothing to grumble about ; viewed as
a steeplechase meeting the programme is badly
arranged. Why not have a couple of steeples and
hurdle races, maiden and open, each day? Jumping
races are always popular with the crowd. If the
answer is that N. S. Wales has an inferior lot of
hurdlers and ’chasers, surely an effort should be
made to improve matters. There is any amount of
room for improvement.
* * * *
The Pistol gelding Greek Fire, a dead-
heater with Woropu for the Maiden Hurdles at
Flemington in July last, had not been doing any-
thing very obtrusive since—except to give a good imi-
tation of being a coot. In October last he ran a
long way astern in a field of six over hurdles at
Randwick —behind Jack Rice, who was giving him
about 4cwt. On May 26 he was given a trip on
the flat in Rosehill Auburn Handicap, a mile, and
waS never in the hunt. But he made up for lost
time on Saturday, winning the First Hurdles at
Randwick almost from end to end. He carried
lOst. 101 b., ran the two miles without pressure in
“431” and incidentally beat three or four recent
winners. As there was money for him at B’s and
10’s, the nag’s recovery of speed was not unex-
pected. On Monday he loaded up list. 101 b. and did
the extra half-mile in lmin. jsee. longer — -just a
tick outside the record.
* * * *
Polycrates is a high-class prad, and when
he was saddled up with lOst. 41b. in the June Stakes
at Randwick on Saturday, the public refused to look
any further for the winner in a field that would have
been hard to sort out if the Newmarket winner had
been absent. The subsequent thud could be heard
•in Flanders. Polycrates got away less expeditiously
than usual, and for three-parts of the journey was
tangled in the ruck. He was up near the fighting
line opposite the Leger, but the cargo was too heavy
then, and Auberic (Bst. 71b.) and Conquistador (Bst.
111 b.) ran home in front, to the joy of Ikevdom.
Both these nags had shown winning form lately.
Auberic, starting at 10’s, won a Welter Mile on the
same course a fortnight before in “394,” and on
the following Saturday was just snuffed out by Cisco
in a similar race at Rosehill. The Ameriean-bred
Conquistador beat a fair crowd over six furlongs at
Randwick on May 19 in “141,” after getting second
at Newcastle with 9st. 21b. in the Shorts, won hv
Speedfast. The winner on Saturday was at any old
price, 15 to 20 being vainly offered. The journey
was finished in “13i,” which is good going.
* * * #
In the Flying on the second day at Rand-
wick Polycrates had lOst. 51b. and the public’s
money again ; but his mind was on other things, and
at the barrier he played up as if possessed of seven
devils and stayed in the ruck all the way. At the
last it looked as if Conquistador was going to get
there. He had cut Dame Acre out of the lead, and
a hundred yards from the line was on his own.
But just as'the holders of scraps of paper on him
were getting ready to collect, Lillyman induced the
mare to come again, and in an all-out tussle she
snatched the bacon. Dame Acre started at 10’s. At
Tattersall’s meeting on May 19 she was served up a
warm favorite for the Flying, but petered out at the
business eixd. On Saturday she did no better. M here-
fore it was supposed by ill-informed people that the
lady was losing her punch. Dame Acre is leased by
trainer W. Booth, of Rosehill, who at this meeting
provided a couple of other winners—the frequently
■ calamitous Clydeside, who annexed _ the Ellesmere
Handicap, 1 j mile; and Gallipoli, to whom fell the
Exeter Handicap. As they started at 15’s and 7's the
stable is probably feeling pretty well.
When Sobrina won from a field of novices
at Randwick on Saturday, carrying Bst. lib., and
carving out the mile in “394,” it seemed a fair thing
to expect her to do something else at the earliest
opportunity. But when she was brought out for the
Winter Stakes, three furlongs further, on the second
dav, this appeai'ed to be forgotten, and‘the money
was all for the Newcastle Cup winner Norbury, Bom-
bita, Chantemerle, Karanaud King, Quarale and
First Lesson. Once moi'e the crowd got a reminder
that there is no form like winning form —the more
recent the better. Sobi'ina, carrying 61b. less than
on the opening day, arrived again. The pay-out in
Israel attracted a very limited congregation. Sobi'ina,
by Mooltan —Clonsilla, was bred by her trainer Bur-
ton, and first attracted notice by finishing within a
neck of Spurn and First Principle in a field of 20 at
Rosehill a couple of months ago. She may be heard
from again. #
Artesian, winner of many a race in
Westralia, had a quick trip the other day to where
the good nags go. Ho was loping along at Rand-
wiek with the hurdler Merrimax oil the middle grass
track and, faltering, was pulled up on a broken
cannon bone. A bullet did the rest. Artesian’s chief
claim to fame was that he won two Perth Cups, 1911
and 1913, with 9st. 21b. and 9st. 71b. On the second
occurrence he gave Lilyveil half' a stone, and the
loser subsequently annexed Sydney Cup with Bst. 81b.
aboard. Artesian was by Argonaut (imp.) from that
good mare Effervesce.
* * * *
A smart two-year-old attracted the atten-
tion of the judge at Ascot (Sydney) last week. This
was Pacolet! by Tressady (imp.)—Archness, who in
her day was a chamnion among the ponies. Pacolet
hopped over the half-mile in 494 sec. and won in a
walk. She is a stable companion of Lady Sucre,
who appropriated a race for juveniles at Warwick
Farm the other day amidst great astonishment.
* * * *
Charles Wheeler’s dreams of a Golden
Shot at this season’s Cups—if lie had any—were
•shattered bv the disqualification of himself, the
horse and the apprentice who rode it in one of the
minor down-the-line handicaps recently. His appeal
to the V.R.C. stewards was dismissed, and his horses
have been transferred to his brother’s stable for a
twelvemonth. The failure of the appeal was a
surprise, considering the number of non-triers that
are treated as a matter of course at the little meets.
Nobody expected Golden Shot to come out and win
again after his spell. But tlie powers-that-be had
got an eye on trainer Wheeler, it seems. The
sudden improvement in Shepherd King’s form last
Spring had set them looking.
# * * *,
The jumping double at the V.R.C. meeting
last Saturday was won by the same two horses —
Lord Dudley and Artillery Bill —that took the same
two events last Birthday. Hurdlers and steeple-
chasers seem to bloom every year at same time,
like violets.
» * * «
The Parisian died the other day. leaving
no family to mourn his loss. In point of fact he was
gelded early in his career. The horse that won a
Melbourne and Australian Cun was contemporary with
Trafalgar, and if the stable estimate of him was
nearly true he was at least as good as the more
famous old battler. On the rare occasions when he
was fancied The Parisian won handsomely. But he
was a difficult animal to train, and the test of his
alleged capacity to run away from Trafalgar at level
weights was never applied. He used to go wrong, as
a ride, after he had been slowly strung up towards
concert pitch. He was the first great horse that
Charles Wheeler trained, and it was an odd coinci-
dence ’that his obituary notices should have clashed
with the announcement that the trainer had been
wiped out for a year.

In the Adelaide Racing Club’s w.f.a.
event, the Parkside Stakes, Mrs. Hawker's Cyklon
won, as at Morphettville, from the unlucky Gold
Cuffs; Aides was third, Pretty Bobby fourth. Tt was
Lewis’s only success for the afternoon, which was a
.ladies’ day all right, for Mus. Alan McFarlane’s
mare Petracia won the Citv Handicap. A strong
favorite, she yet paid a £4 dividend; Perambu-
late, second, paid £4 13s. Lewis was up on E. E.
D. Clarke’s Deneb, but could only get a bad third.
The weather was horrible.

“Marloo”: Committees of country racing
clubs, before installing an expensive tote, would
do well to inquire into the merits of an inex-
pensive machine which was/given a trial at Kyogle
(N.S.W.) races recently. Two men were required
to conduct the business, and the working was sim-
plicity itself. The money invested on each horse,
the total amount betted and the dividend payable
were so quickly displayed that the flag was beaten
on each occasion.
# * * *
Under the regulations governing the total-
isator in South Ans. the fractions of Is. remaining
after the dividend on ‘ the first horse is worked out
go to backers of the second nag. This provided a
treat to Gold Cuffs’ supporters in the Parkside
Stakes, run May 26. Total in machine, £2272
10s.; on Cyklon, the winner, £1194 ss. ; on Gold
Cuffs, second, £298. Worked out exactly the divi-
■ dends would have been £1 4s. 11.7 d. and £1 13s.
4.3 d. respectively. But with the fractions allotted,
Cyklon paid his backers £1 4s. and Gold Cuffs
shelled out £1 175., while charitable institutions
received the odd £3 14s.
“Xoorindoo”: No; that performance by
Clapator of running in three races on one day at
Mudgee (B. 24/5/’l7) is not a record. The secre-
tary of the Roma (Q.) Amateur Race Club will
verify this. On February 25, ’O3, the nag Tedding-
ton, owned by J. T. Naylor and F. R. Rouse, of
Surat, w-on three races and ran a dead-heat in a
day. First he won the Trial Stakes, with lOst. 91b. ;
next he w T on the Hack Handicap, lOst. 71b. ; then he
dead-heated in the Farewell (r.o recoi’d of weight).
The owner of the other dead-heater refused to
divide, so the race was run-off, and Teddington won.
Each event w-as over six furlongs. The horse had
only been a week up from the paddock.

Falkiner. the brilliant billiardist who
lately averaged 64 per innings for a week s play
against Inman, was rejected as physically unfit for
the armv, ar.d is now working eight hours a day in
a munition factory.
George Gray, drifting back again, hopped
ashore with his cue at Maoriland the other day, and
is showing the old men thereabouts how to keep the
marker busy.
* * * *
Two performers with the cue who ran
into the limelight a few years back in England
lately finished their game within a few houi's of each
other. Though both were named Taylor they were
not related. Tom Taylor, noticing in ’Bl that John
Robei-ts and Wra. Cook were both in India, chal-
lenged Bennett for the championship and lost by a
narrow margin. He was a fast scorer, and so eager
that he often raix round the table to be on the balls.
He made a bi-eak of 1467 once, but most of it came
fi-om the “jamb” stroke. He eventually became a
bookmaker, and did well for a while, but died poor.
The other Taylor—Alec—was best known in York-
shire. In a level 9000 up against him Reece only got
home by 70 points. This Taylor was on his way to
Egypt when the old mai-ker called him at Malta.
He was only 41. _
The most important incident in the
assault department o" Saturday evening occurred at
Brisbane. James Hill there boxed himself into a
tired condition by the eighth round, whereupon Herb
McCoy smote him upwards on the chin, and the
episode concluded. At Melbourne George Taylor
trimmed Bert Spargo; and in the temple by the
quiet waters of Rushcutter’s Bay, Sydney, Fritz
Holland gave Jack Cole a useful lesson, terminated in
the tenth by a wallop which John received without
comment. #
With Darcy outed bv a referee who never
makes a bloomer, Mike Gibbons looks to’ have about
the best claim to the middleweight championship.
That he is a boxer of exceptional elusiveness and
skill admits of no moi’e doubt than that Mike wouldn’t
be feeling very well if there was a strong, punishing
fighter with a liking for 20 rounds in pursuit of
him. He has the record of a boxer rather than a
scrapper, and most of it consists of stalling over no-
decision 10-round conflicts.
* * * *
“Yambacoona” : Governors of at least two
of the U.S.A., in addition to placing a bar on any
contest with Darcy as one of the principals, handed
Les the advice to do all his fighting in France along-
side his soldier mates. Seeing that Untie Sam is
sending an army to France, isn’t it about time that
the Yankee pugs, managers and attendant “sports”
-in Australia were given the same advice and treat-
ment ?
* * * *
“Ten field uni” : Concerning tbe question of
the vitalitv of athletes, raised again by Les Darcy's
death, it is a pathological commonplace that the
pneumonia-chances of a big, heavy, presumably
strong subject are notably slenderer than those of
the lighter, slighter and apparently feebler patient.
For the rest, the bulk of medical opinion is not
prepared—in the absence of reliable statistics —to
go beyond the general principle that, though, on the
one hand, physical inefficiency is incompatible with
constitutional vigor, the other extreme, a super-
athletic condition, can be developed only at the
expense of fundamental vitality. The case is
simply one of in medio tutissimus, and the general
experience of the profession is that the attacks of
disease —other things being equal—are best resisted
by the person who, though far from being a mere
phenomenon of muscular capability, is nevertheless
not quite a neglected piece of physical machinery.

Da tel y deceased Bob Martin, a golf cham-
pion in the distant ages when the game was hardly
spoken of dutside Bonnie Scawtland, was then known
as the Herd Laddie, because he had sometimes
taken a ,iob of minding sheep. But he wasn’t the
original champion to bear the same title. The Herd
Laddie who visited Australasia more than 30 years
ago was a grim Scot with a highlv-develooed capacity
for playing draughts. He had the sunniest possible
method of acquiring siller. First of all, he took a
modest fee for attending a draughts club, and there
he sat all the evening, afternoon or morning, pre-
pared to take on competitors. Each competitor in
turn opened the proceedings by puttin’ a. shillun, or
twa saxpences, on the table. The professional Laddie
silently pouched his fee and then started to win the
game. Once in a way he failed to win, but he
wasn’t expected to retxxrn the shullin’ on that
account. He siivnly made a certainty of earning 12
pence per game, like a billiard table.

Thirty-six motor-cyclists who oiled up for
the 24 hours’ reliability event last week had a
strenuous time. The test was over 402 miles of
Western N. S. Wales roads, and all but nine fell by
the wayside before snow and biting wind. Among
the side-care, Hope Bartlett and J. A. Fair (Indian),
F. Delandro (Indian), and AY. R. Park and Jones
(Excelsior) got through without loss of points ; and
' Arthur Biden (Indian) alone scored full points in
the solo class. It was Biden’s fourth success in
reliability events without dropping points—a per-
formance quite worth taking notice of.

The world’s highest "Rugby score (B.
31/5/’l7) doesn’t belong to Sydney Grammar. The

the Army Service Corps (Rugby League) put it in
the shade with wins bv 120 to nil and 118 to nil.
“Padjud”: What sort of “sport” Is cours-
ing-? It is commonly asserted by persons with pups
that hare-chasing is not cruel —that the animal is
scared to death. on being captured. As nothing is
heard in the Ma State to the contrary, it looks as if
the finding of these unbiased judges is taken as cor-
rect. The yarn is a lie. The hare dies when killed
by the tearing teeth of the dog—promptly if the
jaws close on the back and fracture the vertebrse.
But this only happens occasionally. I have seen a
dog savage his running mate off and gallop round
the ground with the crying hare in his mouth. If it
happens that the hare is not damaged beyond repair,
it is coddled up and kept to course another day.
That happened lately near Sydney.
“W.J.H.”: Among the hills around North
Manly the two-up game flourishes. exceedingly, and
crowds of Sydney gamblers journey across every
Sunday to enjoy their favorite sport. There are
over a dozen “rings” cut out in dense paxts of
the scrub, with elaborate arrangements for the
speedy disappearance of the players whenever' danger
is scented. Frequent raids are made by the police,
but the paid scouts of the schools are so numerous
and keen, and their intelligence department alto-
gether so well organised, that the breathless Johns,
when they reach the rings, get no more than a
fleeting vision of the disturbed players. It will
please the godly to learn that these Sunday-schools
have adopted the Follow-the-Iving policy. Beer is
rigidly barred.
“Bill R.” : “V.” (B. 24/5/T7) was wrong in
his surmises concerning the admitted scarcity of
snappei- on the N. S. Males coast, when he atti'ibutes
the diminution to Black Mary’s lake-fishing methods,
and to the “bull-tow-” at deep sea. The principal
agents of depletion have been the Chinese and other
alien net-fishers. Sixteen years ago a line sport
in Narooma Inlet, South Coast, could, in season,
catch cock-snapper so readily that angling for them
almost ceased to be a fair thing. Then the Chow
net-fisher dumped on the shore a sun-drying plant
and commenced preparing fish wholesale for the
Chinese mai-ket. He had gangs of yellow- net-men,
who nightly contravented the Fisheries Act by
uniting miles of nets when the inspector wasn’t look-
ing, and in a very few .years snapper in the lake
were almost as scarce as Ah Sin’s morals.
* * * #
“Cartridge”: The sport known as “flight-
shooting” is not common in Australia, although fair
mimbei's of w-ild duck may be obtained that way.
Shallow reaches and pools in rivers and creeks,
where the ducks feed by night, are llie best bases
and these may be determined by the litter of down,
etc., which lies about. Before dusk the shooter
should be at his rendezvous, which should afford some
cover, and he should choose a night on which the
sky is filled with white, fleecy clouds. Against
such a background the bodies of the flying birds
appear in silhouette. If lucky, the gun will not
have long to wait, for about dusk—with a swishing
and whistling of wings, the birds will begin plump-
ing into the water. Then go for your score as the
targets appear momentarily against the background
of cloud. Black duck, being great wanderers,
are most commonly obtained. Teal, shovellei- and
other varieties are less active foragei-s. In dry
seasons, when ducks are scarce, or in thickly-settled
country where the birds do not remain on the
rivers and creeks during the daytime, the flight-
shooter may still sometimes obtain fair bags. A
good retriever, some bread and cheese and a flask
are welcome companions* The black duck possesses
a wonderfully keen sense of danger, and will give
few opportunities after it alights on the w-ater. Teal
and shoveller, however, are much less alert; but
the wood-duck (maned goose), which throws out
sentinels when feeding in flocks on the green sward
by rivers and creeks, is almost as difficult to
approach as the black species.
# * * *
“Centre”: At Randwick, last Saturday
about sunset, standing directly behind a prone rifle-
man who' was greasing his cartridges to prevent
rifckelling of the barrel, we were able to trace the
full flight of the bullet from muzzle to target—
-500 yards. The bui-ning fat made a faint white
streak through the evening air and reminded me
of the flight of Capital from the Income-tax Com-
missioners.

They don’t leave their pluck behind them,
either. P. Doherty, a returned Billiim with
a paralysed right arm, who storekeeps at
Freshwater, near Sydney, battled out with the
life-line the other Sunday to two fishermen whose
boat had swamped in the surf. lie would have
brought them in, too, only the line broke. Then he
struggled ashore, rang the alarm-bell and let a
boat’s crew complete the job.

There are no teeth like those furnished by Nature. For service, comfort and good
health, artificial teeth cannot be compared with a natural set.
Sensible people will accordingly try to preserve their teeth as long as possible by
keeping them clean. Cold water and soap and water are useful, but somewhat
ineffectual. Rough powders, such as cuttlefish, crabseyes, crude chalks and charcoal
are too severe on the enamel.

Grey Hair Unnecessary.
A simple, old-fashioned home-made lotion that
will restore the color of youth.
One need not resort to the very question-
able expedient of hair dye in order not to
have grey hair. The grey hair can easily
be changed back to a natural color in a
few days’ time merely by the application
of a simple, old-fashioned and perfectly
harmless home-made lotion. Procure from
your chemist two ounces of tammalite con-
centrate and mix it with three ounces of bay
rum. Apply this to the hair a few times
with a small sponge and you will soon have
the pleasure of seeing your grey hair gradu-
ally darkening to the desired shade. The
lotion is pleasant, not sticky or greasy, and
does not injure the hair in any way. " [1

Miss Gladys Cooper Explains
Some Beauty Secrets.
The Popular London Star Favors Simple Methods.
I have been asked to give a few simple recipes that I know, either through personal
use or by observation, to be valuable to the toilet, and which are within the reach of the
average woman. In these days of £lOO facial treatments and elaborate and expensive
beautifying processes my suggestions may read like lessons in economy, but they are
not especially so intended. They are merely practical suggestions, in which the keynote
is “effectiveness.” All the materials or ingredients which I mention are either already
at hand in the home or may be readily procured from the chemist. Fortunately I do not
suffer from the ailments or troubles enumerated below, but some people who are not so
fortunate have told me their experiences, and with your permission I will set forth some
remedies which they have found to be efficacious.
Home-made Hair Tonic.
My acquaintances say that a good stimulant
to the natural growth of the hair is boranium.
A very simple, effective and safe stimulating
lotion made up by mixing one ounce of bora-
nium with i pint of bay. rum. This may be
applied to the hair roots occasionally with the
finger-tips with good results.
Complexion Renewals.
Complexion experts advise me that a normal,
healthy complexion is constantly renewing it-
self by dropping off tiny flakes of worn-out
tissue, thus revealing the fresh young skin
underneath. They say that when this process
cleminite m four tablespoonfuls of water, or
witch-hazel, and use it as a face lotion,
smoothing the skin with the fingers until it
is dry. This method is perfectly harmless.
I am told that a really beautiful, natural, vel-
vety bloom results and remains for many hours
quite unaffected by the most trying conditions
out of doors or in the ballroom or theatre,
and that it gives a tnudh more natural appear-
ance to some skins than does ordinary powder.
Grey Hair.
I have observed many attempts of many
people to conceal grey hair. Some of these
experiments were amusing, some disastrous,
is checked by age, expo-
sure or some of many
causes, the complexion
becomes dull and ugly.
The rational treatment
recommended is to help
the skin perform the
natural functions of
“shedding” worn-out tis-
sue. For this purpose, I
am informed, there is
nothing so good as pure
mercolized wax, used for
a few nights, just as you
would use a face cream.
It is claimed that it pos-
sesses a special affinity
for the effete' scarf-skin,
which it quickly removes
by absorbing it. The face,
I am assured, will soon
look much younger and
prettier under this treat-
ment.
The Curling Iron.
Don’t use a hot iron to
cur] your hair. Some of
my friends make the cun-
ningest sort of curls
wherever they want
them simply by damp-
ing the hair with liquid
silmerine before retiring

nnd some were success*
ful. Personally I believe
I shall let my hair turn
when the appointed time
comes, but if I were
going to try to evade it,
f would give a trial to a
real old “grandmother”
formula that would prob-
ably do the work. This
formula, I am informed,
has been used with de-
grees of success for many
generations, and consists
merely of two ounces of
concentrate of tammalite
mixed with three ounces
of hay rum. It is ap-
plied to the grey hair
a few times with a small
sponge, and ladies tell
me It appears to darken
the hair to a natural
shade, not like a dye, but
gradually and naturally.
Miscellaneous Hints.
A few useful hints from
my friends on aids to
beauty, are as follows:
The eyebrows and lashes
may be made to grow
stronger and darker by
applying rnennaline, a
at night. When the hair is dry in the morn-
ing it will be softly curly just where you
want it to be. This method is perfectly harm-
less, even beneficial to the hair, and the curls
last a long time. The liquid is quite pleasant
and neither sticky nor greasy.
How to Shampoo.
Most women, I am informed, do not know
how to use stallax properly when shampooing
with it. Unless the hair is naturally very
oily, a stallax shampoo may sometimes leave
it rather dry. But lam told if you will apply
olive oil freely ■to your hair and scalp just
before shampooing with stallax. the result is
most delightful. The hair will be left clean,
soft, bright and wavy, the olive oil having
properly balanced the action of this wonderful
hair cleanser.
Is Powder Necessary?
A great many women object to using pow-
der. for various reasons. The following
formula is a good one: Dissolve an ounce of
specially delicate pomade, with the finger-tips
at night.
liouge is often obvious, and many women
therefore prefer to use powdered coiliandum,
which gives a most natural tint.
The lips may be prevented from drying and
chapping by touching them with a stick
of prolactum, which also gives them a good
color.
Freckles are most effectively combated with
ammoniated mercury creams, of• which jetta-
line is the best.

is typically charming. Cut from that most
elegant of materials, patent leather, made in
that new, short-fronted French shape which
makes every foot look so arched and delightful,
this is the shoe of shoes to give a telling finish
to one's new walking suit or gown. And it is only
one shoe amongst many equally desirable.

Union, and was at the helm when the union
conducted what was the first strike of clerks
in Australia. This was in 1910, when
Cockatoo and Garden Island were forced to
close down for 30 hours. He was, and is, a
red-hot anti-conscriptionist, but goes full of
fight to meet Fritz for humanity’s sake. He
is a son of the Labor M.H.R. for South
Sydney.
“J.T.”: Arthur Bayley reported Cool-
gardie, but it was found long enough before
he got there. Prospectors poking round near
the Big Blow in 1894 found notices, on tin,
which, proved, beyond challenge, that the
holding had been pegged in 1881. The relics
were passed over to Bill Faahan, who kept
the pub at the bottom end of Bayley-street—
the Fly Flat end—and I daresay he has
them now, for he has a bigger collection of
the bijouterie, of the roaring days of the
West than has any other man on the hemi-
sphere. Later' on, a couple of skeletons
were found not far from the spot. They
were undated; but it would have been safe
to mark them to correspond with that on the.
notice of application. Their old show was
called the Golden Ridge.
“Good Australian”: An American front-
rank engineer in ’Frisco told me the next
few years would show a big expansion in the
use of the rare minerals and earths. He pre-
dicts a more extended employment of alloys,
and therefore the opening up of more mines
for the tungstic minerals—scheelite and .wol-
fram —bismuth and molybdenite. Also the
supply in U.S.A. of manganese is running
short, he says, and there are no known big
deposits. The U.S. Steel Corporation im-
ports its manganese from the River Amazon
in Brazil by the shipload, and the supply is
petering out. There are some big manga-
nese deposits in Vic. and Tassy which can be
cheaply mined, and ought to be. Magnesite
is wanted and all the relatives of the soda
family. Feldspar and fluorspar are in
demand, and gypsum and diatomaceous
earth.. There are beds of all these substances
. in Australia.
After a good deal of battling Westralian
Minister for Mines Robinson has induced
Cabinet to give a bonus on marketable
graphite produced in that State. . There
are several deposits in the south, south-west
and midland portions of the West, but de-
velopment or production has never been
. attempted on any of them.
An Australian mining man now in the
U.S.A. says the feeling among men in the
metal business there is that silver will pass
4s. shortly.
South Aus. State Savings Bank has
announced that it has done so well with its
investments for the past year that it will pay
4 p.c. to all its depositors during that time
—and per head S. Aus. has more in the
Savings Bank than any other State in the
Commonwealth. It is all right for the man
who has money to put away, but it means
that the other poor devil who has to borrow
is paying 6 p.c. even on Savings Bank securi-
ties. The 4 p.c. rate for deposits was last
equalled in the bad old financial days of
1894.
“Med”: Please return enclosed postcards
to West Maitland (N.S.W.) and tell the
people who sent them in Christmas boxes
of comforts to the boys at the Front that
they are the dead limit. As you see, they
represent local scenes' —St. John’s R.C.
Cathedral; “The Bounteous Harvest, Aus-
tralia”; Belmore Bridge, W. Maitland, etc.
—but if you turn them over you will be
stunned to read “Phototyped in Berlin.'”
“Printed in Prussia.’’ “Series No. K 23.
Printed in Germany.” “No. 1106. Made in
Germany for G. Giovanardi, Sydney.” Darcy
had some excuse for “doing a duck” from up
Maitland way.
“Kukukuku” from her bungalow
Papua has raised its first crop of girls
. —a very small crop, but it will do to go
on, with. Here are a couple of samples. One pretty
girl, aged 20, the kind you see on a summer
magazine cover, and put down in your mind as very
sweet but very useless, goes out surveying with hex-
father into the wilds (and they are very wild) of
the bush. Dresses very daintily as a boy;
does the camp-cooking, tramps over the frightful
Papuan ranges, and does, the work of a .surveyor’s
assistant. When she isn’t doing this kind
of thing she is riding half-broken horses up and
down the 30-odd miles between her father’s planta-
tion and the township; or she is managing the
plantation and its lively cannibal labor, with per-
fect ease and competence, helped only by a delicate
mother. Or else she is making pretty clothes and
wearing them, or dancing all night and riding all
next day. It’s a terrible climate, this Papua;
nearly as bad for breaking people up as the North-
ern Territory. Another young woman, brought
up practically all her life of 18 years in
Papua, with the exception of school down south, also
manages a plantation with her mother, in the
absence of a surveyor father. There are 21 Orokiva
on this plantation; the tribe that eat men alive in
their own villages. This girl handles them
better than any male overseer; sees to the
management of a lime-kiln'; cleans and repairs
a launch, and drives it anywhere up and
down the very stormy and dangerous East End
coasts ; cooks and dairies, and looks after prize fowls,
and also plays the piano, paints and embroiders in
her spare time. The pioneer women of Papua,
almost all dead now, used to do this kind of thing,
minus the painting- and the frills; and they deserve
all honor, for no counti-y ever had a finer race of
mothers. They were rough, for their lives made
them so; they could swear like a. man, hit like a
man, and were handy with rifle and revolver. They
did their own recruiting (and do it still, in one
instance), ran their own ships, could handle a pick
or a needle, an oar or a rolling-pin.

Not only those wno possess classical features are
beautiful. Some wonjen have possessed a feature,
mouth nose or eyes, that was not perfect, and
yet were considered beautiful. Why? Because
they were healthy looking, their skin was clear,
their eyes were bright and their brain was active,

S.E.A.: Very well, fight it out with the
Oldest Inhabitant. He says it was Hereford House
that was burned ; you say it was The Terraces. The
Oldest Inhabitant is interesting enough to afford to
be occasionally wrong... .Needle Bar: Nonsense.
Things are not half as bad as that. The year before
the war Australia imported £BOO,OOO worth of
socks and stockings, of which £570,000 was of
Brtish manufacture Lunatic at Large: Quite so;
we are doing it. But they can’t be allowed to waste
time. The matter is too urgent for that Walgett
to Penrith: Don’t remember it. Can’t print answers
concerning pars., anyhow. If we did there wouldn t
be room to print the pars... .The Cub: Thanks.
E.W.I).: Not quite, but try again... .Peg-leg:
'Don’t like mechanical murder yarns Olive: Bad
verse; worse humor.... P.F.: Verse merely _ shouts
commonplace and cracks on the top notes. .. .I.A. \\ ..
Pour pages to say that!... .Corio: Couldn't you plane
and file the corners of that song and get a thought
into it somewhere?... .Danstewer: It lifts and falls
like a loose sheet of iron in the wind. .. .G.J.M.:
Fairly correct verse, but no attempt to say a fresh
Word. .. .W.R.W.: Stiff, commonplace rhyming in
jerky metre.... A.H.: Poor verse merely repeating
the same old wail A.McN.: No use whatever
Bobs: Depends on what you mean by “original.”
There isn’t a thing in it which hasn’t been'better

TRAGEDY IN A GAMBLING DEN.
In a fashionable den
A young gambler bold
Drew a pistol upon a crook
Wlio’d fleeced him of he’s gold ;
In desperation he fired
At the culprit’s head,
Who fell face down
I pon the table dead;
Through a window the assassin
Did speedily retreat,
And was {tilled by a fall
Of over fourty feet.
In the ghast-’y morgue
The following day.
Murderer and thief for
An inquest lay.
. ...W.C.P.: Well, God save Yankee Doodle, if you
like, but your verses are no encouragement... ..Tack
Plano: Labors too heavily and doesn't make its point
clear. .. .G.G.: “Mate” and “Desert Flowers” won't
d 0... . .Tralas: Verse too slight. . . .D.P.: Joyous idea :
but verse doesn't carry it... .W.C.M.: Awful eonun-
drum verse hurled forth where the Woodsers prowl
and the humor has lost its froth.... E.W.G.: terse
won’t d 0.... ILK.: Not a very inspiring subject; and
it certainly hasn’t inspired you,. ..K.: Stiff' and
artificial; but. those “restless spirits as they lay” are
interesting. They might beat White Leghorns in a
competition.... Bed Ned: Nothing in it.. ..E.N.: It
moves lamely K.C.S.: “Billy” too conventional.
~..S. E. Broke: As poetical as a sewing-machine.
.M.A.R.J.: Don’t worry about a few syllables
more or less in a line. That slither and bump is its
chief charm. .. .M.M.: “Gate” not up.... Gas: Pleas-
ing, but thin. .. .Dolores: Why must you punish the
man for being married by using grammar and verse
like that?. .. .Miss R.: Throw some disinfectant over
your sense of humor. .. . V.S.: Well done, but follows
a rather conventional lme. .. .E.H.T.: ,It isn’t a
“poem.” No sort of reading will make it other
than a piece of creaky--jointed prose. .. . J.L.8.: “The
Mourner” falls down a little where it mixes a brood-
ing spirit with a beating heart. Try it again. .. .
D.H.: Ideas better than verse. .. .0.11.11.: “Modern
Fable” suggests tfiat owning a horse is better than
backing a market garden, but not so pleasant. . . .
Sham: Not dp J.H.: “Timbuctoo” verses have
promise, but ‘'contrary” doesn’t rhyme with “fairy”
and islands “laying mid dim seas” are queer fowl.
....Nem: No thought in it... .G..T.: Small, correct
verse about nothing. .. .A.E.8.: Not much hope while
you rhyme “saw” with “door”. . . . A.M.S.’: “Humor-
ist” doesn’t carry enough smiles... .8.G.: Not up.
. ...J.E.: An old yarn told in the old way....
Gnomer: Very poor verse. ... C. 8.: And still it’s
' pointless. .. .P.W.T.: Nothing. .. .G.E.L.: Lady, for-
bear. You mean well, but ... . J.C.: Prose making
believe that it is verse. .. .R. 5.1.: Stop it. A few
commonplaces thrown together anyhow... .P.N.F.:
Yarn frayed out at the edges.... .G.R.11.: “Chaos”
begins and ends well.. ..Tec: N 0... .Timbuctoo:
No yam in it. .. .H.L.S.: Doesn’t quite work....
Tom 'R.: Everything accepted is paid for; but your
verse will have to improve 700 per cent, before it
scores, .. .R.S.G.: Same old imitation with the same'
old bumps.... P.F.M.: A man who writes like that
surely has no wish to have his copy read... .Pacific:
You must be very young to tell that yarn.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
•Mrs. H.C.-: Couldn’t. .. .D.F.P.: For one thing, the
proportions are wrong. .. .T.S.: ’Way below publica-
tion level D.L.A.: Can’t use it... .G.C.Mc.:
You’re on a long road and haven’t enough equipment.

Killed in Franco, after a long play with
Death, Horace Brown, of H.M. Customs at
Newcastle (N.S.W.), and secretary of the
local P.L.L. and of the Northern branch of
the Rugby League. Enlisting at the outbreak
of war he got as far as Lonesome Pine when
he was knocked out by shell-shock. Invalided
to Australia, he volunteered again, went to
France as a commissioned officer, won a
third star, and was killed on May 12.
From Frisco:—
Full of ruth and rum an Australian was this
week locked up in ’Frisco because he lacked money,
and in the eyes, of Yankee law was a pauper. So, on
the order of Federal Judge Dooling, he was to be
held in durance until the next boat to Sydney. A
private-detective agency, which had been looking for
him all through the U.S.A., thus located him and at.
onhe handed him an order on London for £15,000 —-
left him by a British peer who had been killed at
war. The “sleuths” took the alleged pauper out,
gave him a Turkish bath, a new suit of-clothes and
a gardenia-buttonhole, besides a seven-course “eat,”
as they call a meal hereabouts. Then, pursuant to
the Judge’s order,’they took him hack to clink, where
he will (ontinuc bis r," 1 and occupation of paupei

CONSIDER THE GOODYEAR
UA± ±'M‘V
Consider it well —for it is one of
the motorist’s best friends.
IT HAS ONE MAIN PURPOSE
—TO KEEP GOODYEAR-TYRED
CARS ON THE ROAD AND
AHEAD ON THE ROAD.
And a half-dozen subsidiary pur-
poses:
—to provide longer tyre-life, which
it does through its thick blocks of
tough rubber and its close union
with the tyre-body by means of
many rubber rivets.
—to distribute strains evenly on the
tyre itself, which it does through
the geometrical arrangement of the
projections, all of them spreading
out and meeting at the base.
—to minimise vibration, which it
does through the circumferential
overlapping of the blocks —no
bumping along from one set of
projections to another.
—-to help in insuring riding-comfort,
which it does through its positive
traction, and its smooth-tread effect
on either hard or soft roads.
—to “keep itself together” and not
flip off in chunks or pieces during
hard runs—this because it is made
of a tough but soft rubber com-
pound which will resist stone
cuts better than a hard tread built
for smooth, flinty roads.
KEEPING ON THE ROAD
rather important at all times, but
especially so in wet weather, when
the difficulties of keeping the heavy
car-body from swinging the wheels
around on the slippery pavements
or muddy highways are increased
a hundredfold.
The Goodyear All-Weather Tread
is an ideal ANTI-SKID Tyre—with
an assured non-slip grip on the road.
It has been designed for and has
proved successful in both mud and
dust.
Its big diamond-shaped blocks cut
deep into mud or dust, and the treads
force all such obstructions away
through the diagonal grooves.
These blocks are so arranged that
the sharp edges of the extra tough
rubber present proper resistance to
the highway or street at exadlfy the
“skidding angle.”
Moreover, they are placed sym-
metrically. They cannot make the
car run with a zig-zag motion. They
are scientifically correct to insure
smooth running and straight running
—your car is bound to go forward
without deviation in the direction you
steer it.
KEEPING AHEAD ON THE
ROAD —not necessarily ahead of all
other cars through speed, but ahead
because of the lessened possibilities
of pundfures, freedom from tread cuts,
ultimately causing deterioration in
the tyre, and impossibility of loose-
treads retarding progress and allow-
ing dirt and moisture to disastrously
affect the tyre-fabric or canvas.
The blocks of the All-Weather
Tread are extra-thick. Almost any
object that might cause a puncture
fails to penetrate them; they last for
many thousands of miles before wear-
ing down flat, thus adding mileage
to the whole tyre.
AFTER CONSIDERING these
points of superiority, see the Good-
year All-Weather Tread Tyres at any
Goodyear Service Station, Garage or
Dealer’s —and ask other motorists
who have used them what they think
of them.

to Select Your Corset—
Here we give you five simple rules or guides that will turn the selection of your corset into a real
pleasure:—
First: Decide that your figure is individual —that you need a corset designed for you, and it
should be a front-lace corset.
Second :Go to the store where competent graduate corsetieres are employed. Insist on an
experienced sales person for your fitting.
Third : Remember that your corset dollars go farther if you select two corsets at a time: one
for home wear and another for social engagements and street wear.
Fourth: Unless the corset you select gives you all-day comfort, good-wearing service, and
style that is exclusive, your corset fails, regardless of what you pay for it.
Fifth: You can forget the other rules if the Gossard label is sewn in your corset. Two of
the nine ideal figure types are shown below. There is a Gossard for every figure. Over 50
models for women with full figures.
Ideal Tall and Short
Heavy Figures
.. m
M
Dozens of Gossarc! models for both tall and
short full figures are yours to choose from.
They reduce the hip line from two to six
inches, reduce diaphragm, confine the upper
back, and never ride up on the body. The
elastic sections at sides and back confine
the thighs and upper limbs.
An expert corsetiere, who understands your
figure requirements, will deem it a pleasure
to fit you. Be fitted to-day.

IN BANANA LAND
“Val”: Fortunate is the politician with a
tactful wife. Mrs. Ryan, who accompanies
her husband on all his political tours, adds
much to his popularity by her handling of
the people_ met with en route. She is the
power behind the chair without appearing
to be so. Students of political history in
Queensland u eed not go far back to put their
hands on a, case where it was otherwise.
Home Secretary Iluxham is another of the
fortunates. Here the wife is the better
politician, a'nd also probably the best woman-
speaker in the State.
“Parwan ”: A North Queensland sugar-
planter f/om the back o’ Townsville ex-
plained liow he and his neighbors, although
there art: white ants galore in their vicinity,
have beaten the wood raiders by the simple
method of charring the bottoms of the posts,
house piles, safe-legs, etc., for a few feet
upwards from the ground. The experience
m thht country is that the insect will not
face, charcoal in any shape or form, and that
this; primitive and inexpensive protection
against the; timber ravagers has always been
effective.
“Whaffor”: The manager of a leading
Brisbane hotel gave evidence a few days
ago before the Arbitration Court that he
“employed five cooks, at £5 10s.. £3 10s.,
£2 10s., £2 ss. and £2 2s. (id. respectively. The
cooks were Chinese; he had tried white
cooks, but they were not successful.” Dozens
of other hotelkeepers will tell you the same
thing. The trouble is that Australians have
had and still ha.ve a most foolish objection
to various callings. The cook’s is one of
them. In some parts even vegetable-grow-
ing is despised, and for no better reason
than that Chinamen have collared it. Re-
patriation? Work for returned soldiers?
There’s good pay waiting in a hundred kit-
chens where Ah Grub is now employed.
A strike occurred recently at the Towns-
ville Gas Co.’s works over the action of the
foreman in sacking a man. After some
delay the company: packed the foreman and
put on a new one. Then a fresh strike
took place because tihe new foreman was a
non-unionist. So the second foreman was
sacked and a third installed. It has reached
this stage now in Queensland; sacking is
only a fair deal whein applied to bosses and
foremen.
“A.McI.”: “Half-moon” declared lately
that it took more than a year to get an
estate of £2OO out of the Public Curator’s
hands. Apparently; the Curator always
requires a year. My son was killed
at Lonesome Pine on August 15, 1915. He
was missing at first,; but after nine months
we were officially notified that he had been
killed. The manager of the Superannuation
Board advised that the matter be put through
the Public Curator to save expense. I con-
sented, and after alt kinds of inquiries and
telegrams, and finally the threat of a
Supreme Court writ. I got the money
(£2OO odd) on May; 22, 1917. No interest
>f course.
“Bumble”: The state of most Bananaland
roads is explained by this typical advt. for
an overseer of works for Ivilcoy Shire: —
Duties: To prepare plans and specifications and
estimates of road and bridge works, and supervise
works generally. To work road-grader and bullock
team when necessary. To act as inspector of sani-
tary services and works. The successful applicant to
provide his own horse and conveyance.
The salary, £ISS per annum! It is high
time the Home Secretary took an axe to
Bumbledom on the subject. The Local
Authorities Act provides the Minister with
authority to appoint a Board of examiners
to issue certificates of competency to candi-
dates for employment on Local Government
works, and to prohibit the employment of
any candidate without the necessary ticket.
Nothing has ever been done, and Shire Coun-
cils employ just whom they like at a salary
of generally about £2OO a year. The result
is that, with the supervision over works
that the Councils provide, much of the
money spent upon them is wholly wasted.
To ask the same man to design and construct
bridges, which is highly technical work,
drive a bullock team at odd times, and
undertake other sundry jbbs from hauling
dead cats out of drains to drawing plans is
merely calling tenders for incompetency and
waste.
QUITE THRIFTLESS.
COHEN : “Rosenbaum has failed twice a year ever since I knew him. But I don't believe
he’s got a cent to show for it.”
ABRAMS: “No; dey say he lives right up to his liabilities!"
“Dryberra”: As an election missile the
tomato was easily first favorite with us. Par-
son Plane received more vegetable gifts than
any other metropolitan candidate. The
runner-up was Bayley, of Oxley. Only one
egg, I believe, was hurled—a horrible waste,
too, for it was fresh.
His Ex. Goold-Adams goes north, and a
Lieut.-Gov. is to be appointed. It isn’t at
all likely to be the Government’s special
abhorrence, Chief Justice Pope Cooper.
Goold-Adams himself is alleged to have a
desire to lay his mantle on ex-Premier
Robert Phiip. The Lieut.-Governor’s term
may be longer than the duration of his Ex.’s
stay in the North; for Goold-Adams is
thinking hard about Strickand’s vacated job
in N. S. Wales, and he has friends at Court.
Lord Milner, the protdge of .Toe Chamber-
lain, has sponsored him ever since he was in
Bechuanaland.
Love and Hate.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
My love for you is a timid hind,
Couching among the fern,
In a sheltered spot -where the boughs are
blind
And a scarlet flower in the creepers twined
Over the singing burn,
And my hate for you is a panther black
Ever athirst to spring.
And the twisted vines can scarce keep him
back
I rom the timid hind in the ferny track
n here the scarlet blossoms swung.
Strange that these twain together dwell
W ithin one heart, like Heaven and Hell!
QUEENSLAND.
M. FORREST.
QUEENSLAND GOSSIP.
Brisbane, June 2, 1917.
My Dear Thargomindah,—
The town is at present full of southern
visitors who have hurried north to get warm.
Mrs. A. Greenfield thawed some of them at
Rowe’s Cafe on Tuesday. Mrs. Jack Waller
and several members of the “Look Who’s
Here” co. were of the party, and Mrs. Rain-
bow, Mrs. and Miss Levy and Mrs. Wilson,
all Sydneysiders, helped to put the toasted
muffins in their place. Much the same con-
gregation was tea-ed at the Bellevue on
Thursday afternoon by Mrs. Jack Waller.
The boys at the Kangaroo Point Military
Hospital had a treat on Wednesday, when
Sydney James, with “Billy” under his arm
and some other friendly merry-makers in
attendance, gave an hour or two’s enter-
tainment. The V.A.D. buffet provided re-
freshments.
Contralto Lena Hammond uncorked her
sparkling voice at two patriotic entertain-
ments this week. One, on Wednesday night,
was for the 4th Pioneers’ Comforts Fund;
the other for the 41st and 42nd Com-
forts Funds. With Mrs. Lottie Richter
Davis and Messrs. Crisp and Templeton,
Miss Hammond gave offerings from “Eli-
jah.” The Musical Union had unbosomed
itself of this heavyweight last Tuesday.
A small boy, with a voice exactly like a
flute, did some of the solo work in the
oratorio. He sang the “O Lift Thine Eyes”
trio with Mrs. Davis and Miss Hammond.
It was the only item which got an encore.
During the performance conductor Samp-
son suddenly leaped from his perch to show
a flautist in the orchestra the right place.
The poor man was blowing along two pages
or so behind !
Died in France, Lieut. Ralph Clifton, of
the Flying Corps, the young owner of Jess-
lands. station. A few months ago he was
married in England to Ida Boyd, who for
uiany years pushed a pen for Brisbane
Courier. She got to France in time to see
her husband before he went west.
Mrs. J. J. Dempsey coaxed a large party
of guests to Johnson’s Cafe on Thursday
and interested them in establishing a schools
section of the Red Cross. The Vic. branch
of the society is getting a splendid return
from the youngsters, and the same is hoped
for in Bananaland.
Died last week. Mr. M. Maroney, aged
45, stained-glass worker and expert in pot-
tery. In the latter art he won prizes at the
Panama Exposition and in stained glass his
handicraft lives in many Queensland
churches. The medal awarded him at "Frisco
arrived on the day he was buried at Tnowong.
Leslie Edye, whose fine baritone has been
uplifted ungrudgingly for patriotic pur-
poses, has at last succeeded in getting into
uniform. Doctor after doctor refused to
pass him into camp owing to an eye-trouble,
but that has been overcome. The members
of the Apollo Club (which is the ex-Lieder-
tafel) farewelled him last Tuesday.
A. D. Menzies, for many years one of the
most popular squatters in the Peak Downs
district, where he kept open house at Lang-
ton station, has had a close call in a Mel-
bourne private hospital. Although still very
weak, his condition has slightly improved.
Lieut. Max Chataway, son of a former
Bananaland politician, lately stepped into
the Anzac lines and earned a Military Cross
in the first lap. Cousin Percy Chataway,
who saw war with the original Anzacs,
lately crossed the Channel to exchange his
stripes for stars.
Yours affectionately,
AUSTRALIA JANE.
Arthur Morgan, late Premier and Lie'.’„-
Gov. of Queensland, is well represented at
the Front by three sons.
“M.A.F.”: I ought to know something
about the Australian horse’s stamina. In
.1911 I had charge of 85 waters (including
the once-notorious Bobs) on a 54 days’ trip
from Sydney to London. They were in open
stalls, on the top deck of the Suffolk, and
went through the Rod Sea, Suez and the
Bay of Biscay without rugging. Bobs was
IS years old then, and has lived in England
ever since. Nobody has yet ridden him.
Twenty other walers, added to the above
lot in England, bucked their way later on
through Java, Singapore and India, and the
only losses were caused by accidents. Climatic
changes had no effect at all on these hard
’uns. Many have a buck in them yet.
“S.T.S.”: War with Germany must in the
U.S.A. be something rather like civil war.
I have before me a San Francisco playbill of
a month or two back. It has only two
advts. of refreshments: (1) “Time goes joy-
riding while you enjoy the food, drink, music
and German heartiness of the Heidelberg
Inn.’’ (2) “Hof Bran. Immer Gemuet-
lich! (No cabaret.) Choice music. Mod-
erate prices.” The point is that this was in
no way a German theatre. The audience
would be an ordinary Western-American
crowd, and it is taken for granted by all the
caterers that “German heartiness” is the one
thing such a crowd would want.

Oinnak is a pink powder in an
air-tight tube. Shake a little on
to the palm of the hand and trans-
fer to the tongue. The Oinnak
gasifies immediately, permeates
the air passages, and at once
relieves the stuffiness. It steri-
lises the cold germs and the cure
is begun.
The Oinnak tube is air-tight
and unbreakable, and can be car-
ried in the pocket. An occasional
dose prevents infection.
Carry a Oinnak tube
yourself and send one in
each parcel to France.

The
REPORT OF THE DIRECTORS OF
National Bank of Australasia
Limited.
The Balance-sheet of the Bank as on 31st March last, and the Profit and Loss Account for the Half-
year which then terminated, are now submitted to the Shareholders.

During the half-year the following Agencies in Victoria have been closed, viz: —Allendale, Devinish.
Dingee, Lorquon, Nyah Railway Station, Outtrim, Streatham, Taradale, Thoona, Wangerrip, Wattle Hill
and Waubra ; and Ongerup, in Western Australia.
Several of these Agencies proved to be of very little advantage to the Bank, and their closing incident-
ally reduced the war-time strain on a section of our Staff.
The total number of the Bank’s Staff who have volunteered for service with the Australian Expedi-
tionary Forces is now 316, of whom 27 have joined since our last report.
It is recorded with much regret that in all 23 of our officers have been killed in action or died of
wounds, including 8 during the past half-year, viz:—
2nd Lieut. E. H. Anderson, of Geelong Branch.
Sergeant N. F. B. Huon, Melbourne Office.
Sergeant 11. E. Clark, Adelaide Office.
Corporal L. J. Branson, Adelaide Office.
Corporal C. V. Hodge, Melbourne Office.
Private L. G. Duncan, Bairnsdale Branch.
Private H. G. Kurrle, Melbourne Office.
Private P. J. Cornish, Pyramid Hill Branch.
The following additional casualties have occurred during the 1- If year:—
Wounded. Lieuts. N. Dane, V. B. Daniel, F. P. Frost and .1. R. Macleod; Sergeants A. Andrews
and R. W. Bosisto; Corporals H. B. Lower and A. Thompson; and Privates A. F. Ahern, J. .1.

Lake Condah mission-station (Vic.) has
sent 10 abo. half-castes and full-bloods to
the Front. Two have been killed.
From Captain Parry-Okeden :
Put mv young brother Dave alongside that versa-
tile Australian officer who has been in Light Horse,
Oamel and Flying Corps. Dave went over as
trooper with Ryrie in ’l4, was chauffeur to him
in Egypt, and had charge of all brigade cars. Rose
to sergeant, and, after Gallipoli, to q.m.-sgt. Then
attended an officers" school, and passed as lieut. in
the Imperial Camel Corps. At the biggest sports
held at Tel-el-Kebir last year he won both officers’
races, beating all the Light Horse cracks. Then he
decided to try for the Royal Flying Corps, passed as
a flight-lieut. first try, and since then has been
flying all over the desert and directing the Light
Horse. He is a Bananalander, and never did a
day's soldiering before this war, having been all his
life on Hawkwood cattle station.
Several leading Adelaide firms have been
fined for simply having on sale copies of a
booklet “Stories from the Winning Post,”
Bob Sevier’s sporting print which sometimes
runs in cerulean anecdotes as a side-line.
The Crown Prosecutor explained that he had
acted “on the instructions of the Prime Min-
ister.” and that joint action was being
taken throughout Australia. The news-
agents’ lawyer said pathetically that there
was nothing to guide his clients, and there
ought to be an official censor; that the
W.P. stories were mostly read by men of
the world whose minds were not likely to
become depraved, and that the pictures were
not obscene. “What about this one?” asked
the S.M. But the wig went on to say that
the picture-show advertisements were a great
deal worse and that Shakspeare himself would
have to look out for himself in Adelaide pre-
sently. But even Shake co'uldn’t save the
case. The Court decided that the publica-
tion was not fit to be circulated, and inflicted
a fine all round.
“Bookware”: William Wordsworth,
grandson of the poet, died in Rome on March
7, leaving a pile of unpublished poems which
are certain to see the light now. Matthew
Arnold urged him to publish them earlier,
declaring that the sonnets included some of
the best in the language.
“Copabella”: The agitation started in
Footscray against noxious trades and their
accompanying smells must have come with
a nasty shock to the vaudeville profession,
Melbourne Paunch, State Governors,
Foster Fraser and the comic paragraphist.
Footscray and the smells that are said to
go with that much-maligned suburb (and
don’t) have been the stock joke with these
alleged humorists for a generation. If Foots-
cray succeeds in purging the Maribyrnong
of the “stinkeries” that have damned its
reputation for so long—and it has formed
a virile Ratepayers’ Protection Association
to administer the punch—these people run
the risk of cerebral fever thinking out some-
thing fresh ; and the Firm’s next year’s pan-
tomime “book” will have to be called in for
revision.
The remark of Eliphaz about man being
born to trouble as the sparks fly upward, finds
endorsement from Robert Finch, junior, now
of Mordialloc, but late of Lonesome Pine. A
professional soldier, 24 years of age, he was
in the Garrison Artillery at Queenscliff at
the age of 17, and was blown up by a gun
explosion. Then he went to Brisbane and
Thirsty Island, corresponding meantime with
Florence Watt Press. In August, 1915, he
enlisted in the A.1.F., and became engaged
to Miss Press a week before sailing. Walk-
ing out one night the soldier and his girl saw
two stars fall. “We ought to wish,” said
she. “I wish you come safe home to your
mother.” “And I wish to marry you when
I return. Will you ?” he breathed. “Yes,”
said she. (This was afterwards in cold
matter-of-fact evidence.) He went to the
Front as a gunner on 28s. a week, was
wounded and shell-shocked in Gallipoli, and
experienced a change of heart after Lone-
some Pine. Insomnia and hospital was his
portion on returning to Australia, and he
was discharged from the forces medically
unfit. Then he told Miss Press that things
had gone far enough, and though he had
visited a parson who told him that he could
be married for £3 35., the engagement was
off. There was some talk of another girl.
Miss Press sued him for breach of promise,
and got a verdict for £7O. despite his allega-
tion that love’s young dream had been aban-
doned by mutual consent. Here (for the
present) ends an Anzac’s Romance.
“Ato” : I came across a cypher message in
the “Missing Friends” column of one of the
Melbourne dailies. It kept me puzzled for
a while. Then I got it. To find the first
letter it was necessary to count back seven
letters. To get the next, count forward
seven letters. So on alternately. It was
between the discontented wife and the bloke
who had got out of temptation into a country
town. After I had followed it for several
weeks', there came a message (in cypher, of
course) :
Jim, —I can stand the brute no longer. Come and
take me away. — Jean.
Two days later came the reply:—
Jean,- —Am coming. Meet me next Tuesday, with
luggage, at Spencer-street Station. I’ll have the
tickets. —Jim.
I squandered three shillings next day on an
advt. in their own cypher:—
Jean and Jim. —Better not. You are being watched.
Then there was silence. And now, I don’t
know whether I’ve done a good action in
saving a woman from blundering, or a rotten
one in robbing her of her chance of hap-
piness.
“W.J.11.”: Australian sculptor McKennal
is steadily discharging a debt of gratitude to
the ancient Bernhardt. When he returned
to Australia from London years ago with the
big desire to do something for and in his
native land, he found his native land quite
unresponsive. During the dreary months of
waiting I was a frequent visitor to his studio
in Swanston-street, and listened to his
honest outpourings against the lack of art-
love amongst his wealthy countrymen. He
bitterly regretted leaving London, and ad-
mitted he had not enough money to get back.
Then Bernhardt arrived and gave him a £5OO
commission for a bust of herself. It was
good after that to sit and watch the trans-
formed McKennal work and dodge the
splinters that flew from Sara’s face.

With the advent of nippy
nights one’s thoughts natu-
rally turn to warmth and com-
fort.
The home fires, as generally
understood, are in the fire-
places, around which is the
genial hearth, but the Ideal
Heating System is as its name
signifies.
In simple language, it consists
of a specially-constructed
boiler and pipes for conveying
hot water to specially-designed
Radiators, which should be
placed in every part of the
home, flats, hotel, institution
or building where warmth is
desired.
Thus, instead of the only place
of warmth and comfort being
just around the hearth, it is
every place where necessary —
living-room, bedrooms, hall,
landings, etc.
One might think “How costly
the extra comfort!” Not so,
it is by far the .safest, most
economical and satisfactory
Modern System of Heating.
One boiler will heat many
Radiators. No engineer re-
quired.

HUDSON SUPER-SIX
27,000 Built Last Year
THE year 1916 was a remarkable Hudson year. In a period of less than twelve months, the
Hudson Motor Car Company built 27,000 cars ; turned down orders for over 10,000 because
of lack of manufacturing facilities, and yet were the largest builders of fine cars in the world.
Much of this success was due to the patented Super-Six motor, which increased motor efficiency
SO per cent. As the Hudson motor excels, so does the car in beauty of finish and design. Now
the Super-Six is the leader the standard car for men who want the best.

Run-down
When your system is under-
mined by worry or over-work
—when your vitality is lower-
ed —when you feel “any-how”
—when your nerves are “on
edge ” —when the least exer-
tion tires you —you are in a
Run-down condition. Your
system is like a plant that is
drooping for want of water.
And just as water revives a
drooping plant—so ‘Wincar-
nis ’ gives new life and new
vitality to a “run-down”
constitution. Because ‘Win-
carnis ’ possesses a four-fold
power. It is a Tonic, a
Restorative, a Blood-maker,
and a Nerve Food—all in one.
Therefore
Thu Winu of Life
creates new strength, new
blood, new nerve force, and
new vitality. The benefit
begins from the first wine-
glassful. You can feel it doing
you good. You can feel your
whole system being sur-
charged with new vitality and
new life. That is why over
10,000 Doctors recommend
4 Wincarnis.’
Don’t continue to suffer
needlessly. Get well the
‘Wincarnis ’ way—the quick,
sure, and safe way to obtain
the new health you need.
Begin to get well

1 ‘Blackheads and pimples appeared all
over my face. It was very troublesome
at night as my face seemed as if it was
all on fire. Tne pimples were scattered
and after a few months they used to
appear in patches and fester. The skin
around them being inflamed made them
a great disfigurement.
“I had suffered for two years. I read
of Cuticura Soap and Cuticura Ointment
and thought I would try them. In a few
weeks I had got rid of the pimples and
disfigurement.” (Signed) Miss Ruby

Big Ben is a tried
and trusted public
servant.
He is doing his bit.
He is punctual, well
groomed, business-
like, accurate.

comes to you at 15/-.
Big Ben is good to look upon,
bright, cheerful. He promises
you exact time-keeping qual-
ities—faithful alarm service.
Big Ben is seven inches tall,
well built, handsome, punctual.
He has a big, easily-read dial—a cheer-
ful,deep-toned voice—large, comfortable
winding keys—a light running movement
with watchlike escapement—an alarm
that calls steadily for five minutes or
intermittently for ten. At all clock

The Inky Way.
“T. 1.1.”: The much-travelled Robert
Sparrow Smythe was in the chair of the
Illustrated Post, afterwards known as the
Illustrated Australian News. In the
first of the ’sixties he turned his attention
to the business of an impresario (that was
the year that Lyster brought his Squires-
Esco'tt ti’oupe of operatic artists from San
Francisco). Occasionally, however, he re-
turned to his first love, a notable instance
being when he was installed as editor of a
new Riverina weekly published in Denili-
quin in opposition to the Pastoral Times,
and named the Southern Courier. But
the newcomer didn’t live. “Johns” says That
the Illustrated Post was the first illus-
trated Australian journal. This is not quite
correct. In July, 1850, in Melbourne, was
first published The Illustrated Austra-
lian Magazine, 88 pages octavo, printed
by Samuel Goode, Swanston-street, Mel-
bourne, for Thomas, Jabez and Theophilus
Ham, sole proprietors. There were musical,
literary, scientific and statistical notices,
with much local matter and some verse.
The illustrations were in first-class style, as
might be expected from so able and
enthusiastic an engraver as Thomas Ham.
It lived until the gold-fever broke out, when
the subscribers’ fist vanished.
“Lou” : Bob Ross, who has just given up
the secretaryship of the Yic. Socialist party,
has done his bit for the tiger. He was edi-
tor of a Bananaland sporting paper when
Brisbane Worker commenced to print his
contributions. Then he edited the Broken
Hill Daily Truth for a term, and left it
to put some kick* into Melbourne Socialist.
Maoriland Worker was his next care; then
back to Melbourne to pilot the party again
and edit its organ. Ross’s Monthly was
also started. His energy made the movement
in Melbourne too big for its Elizabeth-street
quarters, so he shifted it to the old Demo-
cratic Hall in Exhibition-street. He now
hands’ the flag to Joe Sweblesses, the young
man who some time back was too “disloyal”
for the Westralian Clerks’ Union to harbor
as secretary.
“Jwosp”: In consequence of the paper
famine two Christchurch (M.L.) fights have
been put out. The Canterbury Times,
weekly brother of the Lyttelton Times, and
dating back to 1865, finished last month,
simultaneously with the Evening News the
evening edition of the Christchurch Press.
The News is the direct descendant of the
Daily Telegraph and Truth, the latter
name being abandoned when John Norton
carried it into M.L. The loss of the evening
rag leaves the new Sun with only one oppo-
nent, the Star, and with the Canterbury
Times gone the Weekly Press is to
have as its rival a bigger edition of the
Spectator, a weekly owned by Internal
Affairs Minister Russell. Paper famine or
not, Christchurch with five dailies and three
weeklies on a population of 90,000 was ripe
for reduction.
* * * *
“J.F.H.” (London) : Newspaper contents
bills, placards and posters disappeared from
the London streets on March 9, abolished by
Government as waste in war-time.' But why
not permit the bills and abolish the papers—
or, anyway, give the proprietors the option?
One of Phil May’s pictures showed a little
girl in a newsvendor’s shop. The gag:
“Please, sir, mother v says will you take back
the paper and give her the bill —there’s more
in it.” In the end each successive edition of
the London evening rags had a separate
shriek featuring its most copper-catching
item. Yet the bill is a comparatively recent
institution, which a number of papers ignored
for some time as vulgar and undignified. For
instance, it was only under the regime of its
last editor, Buckle, that The Times per-
mitted itself to advertise its innards.
* * * *
Two N. S. Wales provincial journalists
have just been lifted into the Leg. Council —
James Ryan, of the Lithgow Mercury, and
G. H. Parley, of the Grafton Examiner.
Ryan’s rag is an influential tri-weekly; Par-
ley’s—he lately went out of active manage-
ment—is now a daily, competing with the
Lismore Northern Star for greatest circu-
lation in the fat North Coast district. The
Star’s rays come out of one of the queerest
old office shacks in Australia; Parley housed
his plant and staff in what used to be the
local theatre, transforming the building into
one of the three best provincial newspaper
offices in N. S. Wales.

“Melb” : The published biography of Arca-

PARAGRAPH OR VERSE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The world with flaming war is lit,
Here in my attic room I sit,
And look out on the fearful deeds,
While far the stricken hero bleeds,
Resolving with a judgment terse
To make it paragraph or verse.
There is the sum of all the strife,
The aim and interest of life.
They hang a man in misty dawn,
A regiment of youthful brawn
Goes out to Sheol with a laugh—
What makes it, verse or paragraph ?
The fox-faced politician racks
His wretched brain until it cracks,
The people in a humor sweep
A little tyrant, to the deep,
Or write a big one’s epitaph.
For me ’tis verse or paragraph.
So like a fisher in the night
My little beacon fire I light, .
And wait for solemn wrecks of ships
Or comic prawns for two-line quips.
Thus life’s construed—not good or worse,
But merely, paragraph or verse?

Middleton’s
great voice on
The NEW EDISON
Arthur Middleton, basso, belongs to that group of peerless artists
known to the world as the New York Metropolitan Opera Company.
For more than two years his voice has won him distinction with this
company.
In Edison s Re-creation of Middleton s great voice every tone is intact.
Music-lovers the world over have expressed their astonishment at the
human qualities of Edison's new invention. Arthur Middleton, as
well as Christine Miller. Albert Spalding and many other such notable
artists have sung in comparison to Edison's Re-creation of their singing
or playing, and famous critics present could not distinguish, the
original from the re-created.
It is a wonderful thing to realise that you are listening to the actual
re-creation of a voice or instrument.

J)0 YOU KNOW the importance of rich blood? It will be evident
when you consider that the entire system derives its nourishment
from the blood.
When the blood is poor in quality and unable properly to perform
its function, the system becomes starved.
The sufferer complains of exhaustion, lassitude, loss of appetite
and depression—he is debilitated.
He will continue to suffer until his blood is enriched and strengthened.
This is when Iron ‘Jelloids,’ The Reliable Tonic, are needed to
enrich and strengthen the blood.
As the blood becomes restored to its normal condition, strength and
energy return —one feels fit and well.
Dr. Andrew Wilson wrote Impoverished blood can be
tt made rich and good by means of Iron ‘Jelloids’ the
most effective and desirable treatment. ’ ’

Hauntings.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A CHE of warm mouths that press and
draw away
Rich in love’s reaping, yet unsatisfied.
Alcoves of tapestry, where for a day
Some Lancelot caressed a monarch’s bride.
Tall yellow lilies in a cloistered walk,
Powdering with hot, bright gold the thiev-
ing bee;
An amaryllis heavy on its stalk
Nodding against a gallant’s gartered knee
As he treads stealthily on trysts of love.
Palm on his dagger hilt, and glances keen,
Finding in luring paths a still warm glove—
A lovely shield where lovelier hands have
been !
Or on some shallow stair, choked with leaf-
drift,
Where from loose nails an ivy arm sweeps
down,
Flint of a graceful shoe, high heeled and
swift,
Searing the emerald mosses into brown.
A corridor at midnight, and the brush
Of little fingers feeling down a wall;
A frightened breath, quick indrawn in the
hush,
A turning handle.. . .and a jewel’s fall.
An open window in a gallery'
Lined with old portraits smirking in the
dark;
Outside the slow regretting of the sea
About the keel of some black, alien bark.
And. in the morning, lids so full of dreams,
Like one who keeps sweet secret thought
she goes,
A\ Idle in a gallery where moonlight streams
Faints on the floor last night’s forgotte/i
rose.
on have looked back from other lives to me,
Hlue eyes that hold a lire, not divine,
And challenge still, with mocking mystery,
Across a goblet brimmed with magic wine.
1' lee with your necromancy, and attaint
Of reinless passion and outlawed romance,
ror I shall never find the dream T paint.
Rapiers grow red with ambush of mis-
chance,
1\ hite roses that were bruised into her
breast
May take a crimson stain ere* they be dust
And wedded hearts might break in severed
rest;
The setting of brave jewels dull and rust,
io-day I want* to think of soft grey hißs.
Leaves dropping gentle showers' at twi-
light time,
A moist arid windless atmosphere that stills
And, through the Christmas rains, a
prayer bell’s chime;
Of flickering homely lights, and children’s
. eyes,
Of little quiet churches in the mist.
Of women motherly and plaiu and wise,
to be unflattered and unkis’t.
These open no dread windows of the past,
Teaching the brain wild fancies, make
a-fire
No ardent niches. Grey and calm, they last
Longer than any scarlets of desire.
Some day, when I am old, I shall stand
close
To those old ghosts that love the false,
the fair,
Free only of the perfume of the rose,
Fragrance and beauty that I cannot share,
lake those old portraits on the oaken wall—
Shall look unmoved on gallants at their
wine,
And if your wandering glance on me should
fall
1 ou will not know the pointed eyes are
mine.
Mine that grow wet for you; but unaware
A ou’ll toast my air aloof with madcap
mirth.
Egad ! Those Puritans! In faith they stare
As if no man had kissed their mouths on
earth !
And you will never know.
Ah, heart unwise!
I have not quite forgotten.
So again
I turn to visions of slow, placid eyes.
And little churches, luminous through rain.
QUEENSLAND.
M. FORREST.
The Shorn Lamb.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THE clay was gold and blue. The wattles
flanking the grass-grown road threw
brilliant scented chrome to the light
air. Three woolly clouds floated above the
sky-line; but they were a mistake of the.
night, and the sun put them out.
Every house with its garden and its orchard
showed ivory masses of pear blossom. The
first sunbeam had called all the perfume of
cultivated and self-grown things to freight
the wind; and the green and treeless
meadows and every rise and rolling hill were
ribboned with the yellow satin of the Cape
weed.
The long undulating panorama of beauty
was broken but not unpicturesquelv by the
mountains of alluvia.l tailings, rounded quartz,
pebbles and boulders, which had carried a
river under the sun long before the cave-man
was; and after its overwhelming by a flood
of lava and ages of burial had been brought
to the surface again and puddled for its gold.
The great heaps shone white like the bleached
round skulls of low-grade men; but they
ended 300yds. short of Jimmy Kelly’s garden,
which was the limit of the lead in this direc-
tion. Immediately behind Kelly’s garden was
a yard-wide creek of rounded quartz, and
behind it again a little alluvial beach sifted
and cradled by three generations in forty
years. At the distant limit of the beach rose
a hill, also of water-worn quartz, as if here
some prehistoric river had emptied itself of
stones through a gorge ending in a cataract.
It was the result of the cataract with the
prehistoric river, gorge and cataract with-
drawn ; and to all the children who played on
it the sheerness of that outer edge made real
a sense of awful depth.
Kelly’s garden was a marvel of white.
This ugly old man, intolerant of youth (prin
cipally for its inability to have been a
nioneer of Ballarat in 1854), unlettered and
narrow in outlook, worshipped his garden
and the sunlight as the most aesthetic of
Pagans. There were magnolias and tube-
roses, gardenias and bouvardias, white holly-
hocks and clove pinks. And on the left flank
of the garden grew a dozen great brugmansia
trees, their thousands’ of double trumpets,
down hanging, and filling the air with heavy
and voluptuous scent.
The perfume of the brugmansia ascended
to them insinuatingly, shaking them to the
very core of life, insistent as the first awak-
ening of sex.
Gerald put his arm around the lame girl,
and her self-pity exaggerated her lameness
as he kissed her.
“You’re going so far aw.ay, Gerald.”
• “Only for a year, Bessie. Then I’ll be
twenty, and you’ll be twenty, and we'll be
married.”
“Take me away from here as soon as you
can. I think she’s the worst stepmother in
the world.”
“I’ll hurry on the trip and get back sooner.
Good-bye, Bess.”
“Good-bye, Jerry! Good-bye.”
lie ran up the slope back to the one street
of the township—manhood eager for destiny.
She followed slowly, limping the more
because she felt the lonelier.
“Hullo, Bess!”
She saw Adam McNair, the red-haired
young man, half-loafer, lialf-fossicker, whom
.local mothers used as the horrible example of
Shake Valley. The short, red hair, coarse
and curly as a retriever’s, clung jto the bullet
contour of his head. All of him spoke of
blood and meat. lie realised his name of
Adam, gotten of red earth and iron.
“H’lo, whateller cryin’ at, Bessie Lynd?”
She looked at him with aversion, mentally
compared him with the chivalrous Gerald,
and went on crying. In the bickering house-
hold of the Lynds Bessie’s stepmother
harried and insulted her until the lame girl
showed a demoniacal rage which awed her
tormentor for an hour.
The old prospector, Tony Barfoot, whose
mental perceptions seemed to grow keener as
his eyes became dimmer, summed-up the
vicnanc of the Lynds as he and his mate sat
at dinner.
"A bad school for a young gal—’tis that,
Jimmy. Ole Lynd under his missus’s fumb —
jus’ like that.” He put his thumb on a
boiled potato and pressed it into paste.
“His missus doesn’t look to anythin’
Headin' novels all day, ’n’ chewin’ lollies.au’
drinkin’ Ilinglish porter, an’ bargin’ at little
lame Bessie. Lynd never could ’aiulle women
proper. He’s so fond of ’em he lets ’em walk
on ’im. Not me. I could always ’old a girl
at arm’s-length, an’ that’s what made ’em
mad for me.... lie—he—he!” He became
suddenly serious, and concluded: “Me poor
wife; she’s gorn—an’ a good woman she was,
too.”
Mrs. Lynd was at that moment reading a
book Barfoot described as by “Maria Corley.”
The querulous infant wailed and was given
three rocks and no more. The weary child
tugged at her mother’s dress, and was to her
but a voice crying in the wilderness.
Mrs. Lynd turned over another page and
sniffed. Her romantic soul was touched to
its deepest sham enthusiasm. She sniffed
again and two fat tears trickled down her
nose. The child at her side screamed sud-
denly, as one discovering the ineffectiveness
oi mere whimpering—and tiptoeing on his
mother’s slippered foot pulled away the book
that had caused her delicious grief. While
her eyes were yet streaming for the sorrow of
some wastrel heroine the frowsv woman
cuffed her son, and he howled by reason of
the pain.
At that moment Bessie entered, all her
kindliness in arms to protect the child.
Oh, that was too hard! You’ve hurt
him!”
The romantic lady forgot the wastrel
heroine in rage. “You! How dare you talk
to me ! Another word and I’ll serve you the
same.’
You dare not strike me,” said Bessie and
very confidently, for injury had herebefore
stopped at words, and she was constitution-
ally unable to brood on verbal wrongs.
“Daren’t! Daren’t! You little gad-
about !”
It was done. The big woman struck the
lame girl and felled her to a chair. Bessie
arose, half-stunned by the blow, but hiding
the pain with pride.
Then she turned like a frightened animal
and ran from the house.
At the foot of Kelly’s garden Bessie halted
for a moment, too exhausted by running to
sob any longer—too shamed to shed another
tear. The blow still tingled on her face.
She felt that she only lived to injure her
father’s wife. The scents of the garden came
to her fitfully, puffed by the momentarily
making and breaking breeze. She walked
mechanically up the steep slope of the hill of
grass-covered quartz, and sat down high
above the valley and near the verge. Below
her the thick night showed oily gulfs of air;
by a shadow which was a pine-tree climbed
a whitefaced star; but all the other stars
that prinked the sky were soft, steadfast and
red. She sat there, more isolated bv friend-
lessness than by height and darkness, and
wished that the night might really descend
upon her and smother her out of the unhaonv
world.
She saw no light, no open door, and she
was very young, and death seemed an eter-
nity away. She began to cry again. The
night piessed on her and looked into her eves
with menace.
“What yer cryin’ for, Bess? Don’t crv.
it s no good.”
The Adamic man seated himself at her side
and very closely to her. and Bessie did not
move away because she was lonely and afraid
“Poor Hl’ thing! What’s the matter,
Bess ?’ ’
“Mrs. Lynd str—struck me, Adam.”
‘‘Th’ old cat.”
“They d-d-don't want me—Gerald d-d-don’t
want me.”
“I suppose lie’s got another gal.”
Bessie’s grief became louder. “Oh if
did that, I’d hate him.”
“I know them city blokes. Wv’ mind '
Nev’ mind ! Poor Hl’ gal. There !”
He put his arm around her neck and kissed
her.
The fitful'wind brought to them the scent
of the brugmansias in Kelly’s garden a

THE KIDNEYS
NEVER REST.
The kidneys never take a moment’s rest; they keep on with
their great work of filtering out uric acid and kidney poisons,
day after day, night after night, as long as we live. And so
important is their work that, even though they get only a little
behind, no part of the system is free from danger; the back
aches, the limbs drag, the eyelids seem like lead; there are
dropsical swellings, rheumatic pains, dizzy spells, urinary
troubles.
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills are special kidney help.
They correct urinary disorders, gravel, bladder troubles —cure
backache, rheumatism, dropsy and every kidney complaint. The genuine Doan’s Backache
Kidney Pills are reliable for men and women, old and young.
Sydney Woman Cured to Stay Cured.
Mrs. W. Benn, 12 Turner Street, Sydney, says:—“I am quite convinced that I owe my life to Doan’s Backache
Kidney Pills, for this remedy cured me of dropsy and other symptoms of disordered kidneys. My ill-health started with back-
ache, then I got urinary trouble and dropsy. My back was always aching; the sharp, shooting pains being so bad that I
would have hot flannels put on to try and get ease. The secretions were thick, and caused intense pain. I was fit for
nothing, feeling tired out always, and I had bad headaches. My legs and feet swelled to twice their natural size ; I could not
put my boots on, and I practically lost the use of my legs. I was really very ill, and nobody thought I would ever get well.
I tried every remedy I could hear of, but got no better. The doctors whom I consulted could do me no good, and gave up
my case as hopeless. A friend advised me to use Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills, and I procured some. The first few bottles
gave me relief, and twelve bottles completed my cure. I am now quite free of the dropsy and backache, and the secretions are
regulated. Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills have cured me completely and permanently, for 1 have been quite well for two and
a half years now. I cannot sufficiently praise Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills —they saved my life.”
Mrs. Benn makes a second statement seven years later:—“I am pleased to add that I have had no return of dropsy or any
other symptom of kidney trouble since Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills cured me over nine years ago.”

taint, luxurious scent it was, hinting of
palaces and moonlight and jewels and wine,
and not of merely a cottage garden leached
of its perfume by the opulent night. From
the well stirred earth of field and garden
arose the odors of new life. The heavy half
darkness hid the generation of plants and
flower and grass. They felt unconsciously
that the earth teemed with action and that
air was languid with desire.
She cried no more, but defended herself
feebly. The air moved for a moment, and
the scent of the brugmansias flowed around
her and slowly paralysed her will, while this
brutal clamant life beat at the despairing
citadel, “failing like a sick man trying to
drive away a hungry lion through a wood.”
* * * *
She came to the starlit height weeping for
small injury. She went back to the house
she had hated as if it were a house of happi-
ness, for any harbor was welcome now, when
the mortal insult of the afternoon disap-
peared in the injury of the night—its terror
and its shame.
She had lost all count of time, but knew
the hour to be late by the rising of the moon,
yet she walked at a funereal pace to the
house she had hoped that afternoon to leave
for ever, going to it to hide herself as gladly
as if it were to be her grave. And in that
moment she loved Gerald more than she had
ever done, because she had injured him by
breaking faith and because she wanted him
above all others.
The moon shone on the mire and the night
was full of loveliness.
“The pride of the Height, the clear firma-
ment, the beauty of Heaven with all his
glorious show.”
In a few months her unwilling intrigue
with McNair was suspected, for his neglect
of her made her pursue him. A new in-
terest made him important. The poor girl
was to have a child. But for that she would
have ceased her pursuit and have forgotten
him, for his insulting treatment of her before
others made her hate him bitterly.
The insults she could forgive, but not the
audience. Then he found ounces under an
old puddling-machine, and interposed between
them the new obstacle of wealth.
In anticipation of the trial that was to
be, the father of the child became a neces-
sity. She overlooked his brutalities and
prayed—if ever woman prayed—that he
might marry her. Her condition made him
kindly at intervals, as a wolf might be
kindly to his mate. And in his way lie was
the ideal lover for such an emotional con-
tradiction as she, for with one hand he
thrust her away, and with the other drew
her back again. When she was merry or
appeared to be merry—for the poor wretch
had the shadow of the future in her thoughts
always—he was brutal; and when she wept
he softened to her suddenly and patted her
at least to calmness. But he never forgot
that he was Man, the Conqueror—never
forgot that lie had beaten her—and that
knowledge gives such a man a new capacity
for inflicting pain.
Their every meeting resolved itself into
tears and pleadings on her part, and savage
irritability on his; so that at last, tiring of
this pale, lame girl, who had lost all her
beauty and impudence, he came to her no
more. On the third day she sought him,
made him walk with her, and when she
reached the quiet of the bush asked him
again to marry her, and threatened, if he
failed, to seek the protection of Gerald, of
whom she knew that Adam was secretly
afraid. And then did Adam, badgered into
definiteness, agree to meet her the next
afternoon at the registrar’s in the Lower
Valley, and she, knowing nothing of the
difficulties and formalities of a marriage,
cried a little to show her gratitude and went
back to drudgery, glad with the anticipation
of being righted and counting the hours
until next afternoon.
The wedding-day was cold, the Valley
lashed by the winds that had been to the
Dividing Range for ice, the air embittered
by sleet. Yet Bessie was almost happy.
She despised Adam, while loving Gerald and
trying to forget him; yet for the first moment
of meeting, the fear of conventions made
her affectionate to this brutal man, who
had promised to aid her escaping public
censure.
They walked out together towards the
Registrar’s. At the bank Adam told her
curtly to “wait a moment,” and entered the
building. He came out with banknotes in
his hands—he had drawn the money of the
golden puddler—and the last uneasiness left
the mind of Bessie. He could have with-
drawn the money only for the purposes of
the marriage. The ceremony mattered all
to her and she never thought of plans to
follow it.
The big lumbering coach for Ballarat came
rocking through the sleet. It was without
a passenger. The driver sat alone, a bundle
of clothes and canvas. Adam held up his
hand and the coach stopped.
“Got my swag on?” asked the red man.
• “Yes —swag and a tent.”
“Adam! Adam! We can’t go to-day,”
said Bessie, trying to strangle a new fear.
“I’m goin’. It’s no use cryin’. I’m goin’
West. ’Ere’s three pounds for yer. No good
cryin’.”
lie put the notes into her hands. She
held them unconsciously—dazed even when
he left her and mounted by the wheel to the
box.
“Good-bye! No use cryin’! Drive on,
Bill.”
The coach-driver sent his horses up to the
collar and the big coach swayed into the
mist A half-consciousness returned to
Bessie. She looked at the banknotes in
her hands and laughed. She opened her
hands and released the notes. The wind
caught them and took them out of sight
in a moment. She had dressed in her poor
finery that day. Anticipation had flushed
her cheek and given her step a youthful
spring it had not known for many months.
And this treachery had made her in a
moment pale and old —a girl no longer, but
a little woman whose lameness made her
drag one leg as if she had long been a
convict in chains.
“Got a match? I want me pipe. It’s
flamin’ cold for a man.”
And for the shorn lamb there was no tem-
pering of the wind.
“That your girl?” asked the. driver.
Adam laughed heartily. “Little dot and
carry one ! Always runnin’ after me . But
she ain’t my girl. I’m goin’ West.”
“Thought she was,” said the driver. tehe
was cryin’. My mistake.”
RANDOLPH BEDFORD.
A Principle in Life.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
f r man in the oily clothes and broken
I boots, having satisfied his appetite,
carried his beer and placed it on a
little wooden table by a settee and sat down.
Then he sipped the yellow fluid once more,
and sat back in pleasing reverie.
Another man came along, carrying a simi-
lar glass of beer, and accidentally bumped
against the little table. Some of the beer
in the other man’s glass splashed over the
side.
“Look out, clumsy,” said the sitting-down
man in alarm. “Can’t yer look where yer
goin’?”
“Beg pardon,” said the second man. “Was
it yourn wot spilt?”
“Yes, it was,” in an injured tone. “Some
blokes never look where they’re goin’,” he
added.
“After all,” said the offender, “it was only
a few drops wot spilt.”
“Yes, I know it was only a few drops
wot spilt, but* it’s the principle of the thing
wot matters, not the beer wot’s lost.”
“Well, there’s no need to make a song of
it,” said the other man, sitting down and
placing his beer beside the other beer.
“Yes, there is,” said the man who had lost
a few drops of his beer. “When things like
this—unnecessary things—’appen, we can’t
make too much of a song. It’s the want of a
principle in life wot makes all the world go
wrong. If we ’ad a principle in life it would
be better for all of us. Don’t forget that
that few drops of beer wot’s spilt can never
be recalled. If it was only one drop of beer
it wouldn’t matter, but take all the drops
wot’s spilt day by day, an’ you’ll find oceans
of beer is wasted, beer wot men have toiled
to make, sweated for with their life-blood.
En serouchers come along and bump over
drops, en more, without a thought of the
harm they does.”
The second man grunted, and drank some
of bis beer, and then, catching the eyes of a
couple more of his class, winked.
“It’s like the precious sands of your life
that you waste,” went on the reformer. “Yeh
idle away your precious seconds, and yer
never thinks that these precious seconds,
like yer drops of beer, is gone past recall.
We are here to-day and gone to-morrer, and
when yer stews in eternity then ye’ll
look back and think of what yer
might have done when y’ ’ad the oppertunity
in this life, and.of the times yer sat down
when yer might ’ave been up an’ doin’
good deeds.”
“Wot deeds?” asked one of the men.
“Think of the weary feller-blokes famishin’
be the wayside yer might ’old out y’ helpin’
’and ter, and the widders and orphans
weepin’ and hungry yer might say a kind
word to, a word of encouragement. Every
second of yer life there is something yer
can be doin’, something ter help yer feller-
blokes ; and when yer sits alone yer can be
castin’ out devils, the devils of yer thoughts,
and thinkin’ good thoughts instead. It is by
'doin’ these things yer can make the world a
better place to live in. Never look back
from y’ old age and see a wasted second;
always look back and be able to say that
whenever yer seen a bit of work lyin’ about
to be done, you’re done it with all yer
might.”
“Now, now, that will do,” said the man
who had spilt the beer. “We’ve had enough
of you. Stow it, or there’s goin’ to be
trouble.”
He stood up and confronted the speaker
threateningly. The reformer cowered.
“I’m not doin’ any ’arm.”
“Yer talkin’ rot, that’s wot yer doin’.”
“It’s not rot, it’s outer print.”
“Don’t tell lies. Nobody would print such
rot.”
“He’s beep makin’ it up outer ’is ’ead,”
said an interested neighbor.
“I’ve not been makin’ it up outer me
’ead. I got it outer a trac’ for serouchers
wot a bloke give me.”
“He’s a liar,” said the Chesterfield of the
party. ‘ “He can’t read.”
“Yes, I can read,” said the reformer, and
then, after a rapid reflection, “and any-
way, the bloke wot give it to me read it for
me. Here’s the trac’ if you don’t believe
me.”
He produced one of those little leaflets
well-meaning people with an unbalanced
look about them go round giving to men
when they are swim ling their dogs on Sun-
day mornings.
The few men in mean clothes clustered
round it while the beer-spiller read it. Not
that they were interested in tracts, but so
as to prove that the man who had had his
beer spilt was not a liar.
The man who had lost a few drops of his
beer leant back in the settee and went to
sleep.
It took some time to read the tract, and
when it was finished voices sounded disap-
proval.
“I believe,” said the spiller of beer, “in
live and let live.”
And then they gradually passed away into
the sunlight. But the precious-seconds man
still slept on.
At'length, when the business of the morn-
ing was slackening, a barman sighted him,
and, with the rapidity of an expert chueker-
out, caught him by the collar and had him
on the pavement before he was awake.
“Ain’t my thrippence as good as another
bloke’s?” asked the ejected one.
“We don’t want you anyway,” said the
barman.
As the barman went in a newcomer asked :
“Wot’s up, Jim?”
“Oh, nothing,” said the barman, “only
some blokes want to make a bedroom of the
bleedin' bar.”

a WOP d largely used in these days—may be said to accurately express,
in so far as any single word can, what is the careful and considered
conclusion which has been arrived at by many people who use
Beeeham’s Pills. They consider that Beeeham’s Pills are “indispen-
sable” to their health, and, as a matter of course, to their happiness;
and they never allow themselves to be without a supply of this valuable
medicine in their homes. This latter is an excellent idea, and one
worthy of imitation—for there is no doubt whatever, that, as a preven-

only an “out of sorts ” feeling is experienced and before any definite
ailment has developed—Beecham’s Pills are a positive boon. They do
good all round;— they tone up the stomach, correct the action of the
liver, regulate the bowels and are a powerful agent in purifying the

Thousands of business men who strive for 100 per cent efficiency in the office
are still content with from 40 to 50 per cent efficiency in the bath room.
The demand for more speed, less muss, less of the tedium of relathering,
rubbing-in, and slow, difficult shaving, and less smart, bite and irritation, has
caused many men to discard successively the mug, the. stick and the powder
as they would discard a wasteful, antiquated machine in the factory.
Mennen’s Shaving Cream overcomes every objection to mugs, sticks, and
powders. It is sanitary. It actually softens the beard. It leaves the skin
soft cool and refreshed. There is not a bite or a smart in a tube of it.
Mennen’s Shaving Cream costs but little more than bar or stick and. lasts
longer than powder. A tube, if used according to directions, will deliver a
shave a day for months. Obtainable at all leading chemist* tmd stores
