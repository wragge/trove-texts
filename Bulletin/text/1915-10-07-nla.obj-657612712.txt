SECURES SOUND WHITE TEETH HOW TO use THE POWDER,
Some practical reasons why Hudson’s Eumenthol
Tooth Powder should be used for the
Preservation of the Teeth.
BECAUSE it contains the Germicidal and Antiseptic virtues that
have made Eumenthol Jujubes famoys the world over.
BECAUSE it is not only an Antiseptic and Germicide, but cleanses
mechanically, owing to the evolution of oxygen when in con-
tact with water or moisture.
BECAUSE it is the oxygen which whitens the Teeth so wonder-
fully, and wards off decay as no other preparation for the
Teeth can or will do.

■tits step tvas as hold and as certain as sin,
uis limbs were as clean as a batten,
Ana flashings of gold from his velvety ski
ahone soft with the lustre of satin.
And Wm. Jas. Wye has the same exper;
and caressing touch in his description o:i
buckjumping:—
There’s the poetry of motion in the lightning
like rebound,
As he tries his master trick that seldon
fails;
As the sudden shoulder choppings graze the
kneepads on the ground,
There’s a cry comes ringing from the home
stead rails.
How the heart-strings thrill in chorus and
the pulses leap with fire
To the music of the hoof-beats as they ring
And with blue eyes by the sliprails, what
more could man desire? —
You’ie on a living throne, and feel a king.
He’s a lightning-circus artist, he’s a juggle)
in disguise,
His contortion acts are simply gems of grace,
I have had a go at most things, but avow
with opened eyes
In my heart of hearts he takes the pride of
place.
He is upside down in mid-air, and you hold
your breath and wait,
For your life hangs in the balance, touch and
go,
As he turns ’twixt earth and heaven and
portrays the figure eight,
And the sliprails seem a long way down
below.
He holds, Wm. Jas. Wye, the simple creed
of the Australian horseman:—
’Tis well the Australians should worship the
horse;
Apart from the glory and love of the chase,
It tends for the national good of the race.
And triumphantly he asks:—
And what won’t men do for a girl or a horse?
Wm. Jas. Wye makes no claims to be a
poet; hut he is the finest horse-poet m Aus-
tralia. And he knows his subject: the tech-
nical touch is in all his verse, whether writ-
ing of mustering, overlanding or the wiles of
country racing. “Brady” is as good as
“Clancy.” There are hoof-beats in every
stanza of modest Wm. Jas. Wye.
Old Blues and Reds, by “Firenze” (Adel-
aide), is a little booklet of war verse whose
modest merits survive the first commonplace,
poem. “The South Australian Mother’s Call
to Arms” happily expresses a genuine senti-
ment :—•
You cannot let them fight for you—not if
you're mgn of grit,
Don't say, “ There's plenty yet to go!”
Don't he a “xvait-a-bit.”
To urge her men to chivalry is not a
ivoman's work,
A mother's heart is hot wth shame whose
hoy elects to shirk.
You strong lads of Australia, and men of
fighting age,
Don't let your mothers kneel to you—piok
up the hattle-gage!
Our hearts are aching quite enough for those
who had to go,
Don't let them break for those who won't.
Spare us that shameful blow.
And in “The Fighting Line” the agony of
motherhood, so common now as the lists
mount up, finds expression in at least some
of its stanzas :
Oh! the marching through the street—
Oh! the roadways, paved with hearts
Quivering to the war-drum's heat,
As the fighting line departs.
Hearts are breaking, day by day,
As the trampling feet pass byj
"Naught to do but dumbly pray —
Give our all — and’ make no cry....
Children we have borne in pain —
Love's seal set on each dear browj
We who gave must give again —
God of mercy! Help us now! /
Our high hopes are in the dust,
All our lives athwart are riven;
Er'ry tie aside is thrust —
Heart's blood to the nation given.
Ever as the years roll by,
In our ears the drums will beat;
And our hearts will make reply
To the tramp of phantom feet....
“Firenze” writes crudely, but it is a
mother writing of her soldier sons: her tears
transfigure her halting verses.
Nina Murdoch is one of our most pro-
mising verse-writers. Her collection of
verse, Stings of the Open Air (W. Brooks,
Sydney), leaves her —one of our most pro-
mising verse-writers. The book is not an
achievement: Nina Murdoch is too young
yet; but, for her youth, it is a highly inter-
esting prelude to a possible future brilliance.
Her love-verse- is loveless verse. She can
naively say:—
I shall laugh and make it a theme for song
If I lose the lover and find the mate.
And with the strange perversion of the
poetess she falsifies most of her love-songs
by the palpable pretence that she is the male.
In the person of Him she sings of the de-
lights and beauties of Her. One song,
“O-karne,” in which the authentic woman
speaks, is worth all the others in which a
woman speaks in the tones that she imag-
ines her lover would use.
But such falsities are the faults of youth:
Nina Murdoch has sufficient talent to carry
her beyond this phase.
It is as a sonneteer that already Nina
Murdoch has achieved a name. Her twelve
sonnets of the Australian months, most of
which found high places in this page’s re-
cent competition, are a valuable contribu-
tion to Australian poetry, while her prize-
winning sonnet upon “Canberra” remains a
permanent possession. How fine is her
sestette!—
Haply the years, with cunning fingers, swift
Will weave this tieggar maid a costly gown
Of borrowed splendor, and to deck her hair
Will bring a flashing diadem for gift.
Yet though she wear fine raiment and a
crown,
What power can make a barren woman
bear?
Interesting is her frequent and accurate
use of Australian flora. These sonnets and
her other verses blaze with a wealth of
native blossom.
Her sonnets stand apart; but Nina Mur-
doch shows that she can succeed when re-
leased from the shackles of that highly arti-
ficial. form. It is not in her false love-verses,
but in such poems of simple and genuine
emotion as “Colored Bows,” the “Song of
the Slum-Woman,” and her already famous
Socks, ’ that Nina Murdoch points more
surely to a personal achievement. We quote
two pieces, one for its deserved popularity
and the other for its homely pathos. Inci-
dentally one wonders why in “Socks” a
lerson named Hercules is permitted to in-
trude :—
SOCKS.
Two plain, purl two,
It’s little else a woman can do
But hear sons and watch them grow,
Till marching out of her life they go.
Knit five, purl one,
I doubt if ever a mother’s son ~
In war's cause hacked and cleft,
Knows half the hurt of the woman that’s
left.
Slip one, purl eight,
There’s nothing left but to hope and wait,
And the seven tasks of Hercules
W ould count as little compared urith these.
Turn, slip, then the heel,
Out of sorjow comes haply weal,
But fair times are far away,
And there’s many weep for their men to-day.
Cast off, the thing’s done!
Many a husband and many a son
Find death in hapless war,
Nor ever knoxo what they fought it for.
Two plain, purl two,
It’s little else a woman can do
But bear sons and watch them grow,
Till marching out of her life they go.
SONG OF THE SLUM-WOMAN.
The haby and the rubbish-tin are huddled
side by side,
I’m gettin’ through the washin’, and the
yard is not too wide;
’N’ when you come to think of it, it doesn't
seem quite square,
For the baby 'n' the rubbish-tin to sit
together there.
Of course there's room enough for 'im to
play upon the street
(Next door but one a kid got crushed beneath
an 'orse’s feet) :
'E sits quite good 'n' quiet, 'n' 'e never starts
to whine
Till 'is eyes get sort of achy with the flappin ’
on the line.
There is 'Ospitals for Women, V there’s
Infants’ ’Omes as well,
’N’ the Walker Convalescent you can rest in
for a spell.
It ’d be a deal sight cheaper than the nurse,
’n bed, V ward .
If the Council ’d provide us with a decent-
sized backyard.
For there's Billy down with fever, 'n' there’s
Janie got sore eyes,
’A ’ Hector, though ’e’s turned fifteen, 'e isn’t
any size.
Yet they fill us up with Charity in ’Ospitals
V all!
Won’t anybody tell ’em they're against a.
bloomin’ wall?
If they’s start from the beginning like, with
> rentals on the square,
A pull these rotten houses down, 'n ’ ’elp
its get fresh air,
If they’d see ive got conveniences—not much,
just what we need —•
Why they d have both feet on sickness, ’fore
it ad the chanoe to breed!
But the baby ’n’ the rubbish-tin are huddled
side by side,
I’m gettin’ through the washing and the yard
is not too wide.
There’s the Parliament V Premier V the
grand Lord Mayor, too —
It hind o’ sets you tOond’rin’ what they all
intend to do!
The name of Vance Palmer, author of The
Forerunners (the Euston Press, Euston
Buildings, London, N.W.; 2s. 6d.), must be
added to our slowly lengthening list of
genuine Australian poets. Palmer adds to a
poetic vision an artistic craftsmanship, a lov-
ing care of words and a keen sense of rhythm.
He knows Australia, and he can bring Aus-
tralia to our eyes. His verse is simple,
direct; little pictures perfectly painted, brief
dramas swiftly enacted, delicate moods subtly
evoked, vague memories recalled by a single
pregnant phrase. Take his “Road to Roma
Jail,” with the cunning alliteration that
makes the stanzas sing themselves:—-
It's a long road, a cruel road, the road to
Roma Jail,
Birds in all the branches mocking as you
pass,
The spiteful little soldier-bird, the stupid
old jackass,
Crying, “One, two, three of themj riding
head to tail,"
On the long road, the cruel road, the road to
Roma Jail.
Crookedly the track runs beneath the brassy
skies,
Silver shines the mulga, golden glows the
plain,
Bullocks in the barley-grass start and stare
again,
Stockmen at the station-yards watch the
white dust rise,
But one mail, jogging on, dare not raise his
eyes.
Pride of life and wild blood, all must pay the
toll,
Stolen horses’ mouths are hard as misers’
hearts,
None know where the end is once the journey
starts,
And Steve rides a long ride to reach a bitter
goal,
While black imps, grinning imps, hover round
his soul.
It’s a long road, a cruel road, the road to
Roma Jail.
A trooper rides behind you, a tracker rides
before,
Your hands are tied, your head bowed, your
heart and body sore,
And high above you in the blue the homing
wood-duck sail,
On the long road, the cruel road, the road to
Roma Jail.
Or this, old subject so freshly and poig-
nantly re-eivated:—
THE HOUR OF MEMORY.
When supper's done and pipes are lit,
And thoughts of work are put away,
While round the fire the stockmen sit
And watch the creeping shadows play,
And tell great tales of camp and track
While the slow wood-smoke upivard curls,
And at a table near the back
Clarrie plays poker with the girls,
And the tired dogs dream at our feet
And lazily ivatch the cheery blaze
That recompenses with its heat
For blistered paws and hungry days,
I push a little door ajar,
And steal out to a garden close,
Where all our folded memories are....
And oleander and ichite rose
Bring back the night that lives and burns
Though golden wattles o’er you meet,
And from the dust no thought returns
To mix with mine and make it sweet. .,.
Your voice was hushed, your eyes aflame,
Love streamed from your soft finger-tips,
And ivhen the hour of parting came
Your twining hands and clinging Ups
Put thoughts of parting hence, though, soon
The hills would color with pale light,
And the faint stars and the round moon
Would veil their eyes and take their flight.
Oh, flame and wonder torn apart!
Can no word stir your hidden heart?
Such poems express Vance Palmer’s deli-
cate quality. His range is limited, but within
his range he is a sure craftsman. He sings of
A candle shining through wet bQiighs,
The smell of wood-smoke in the rain;
And like the magic that dwells in these
simple things, his simple verses “rouse the
shadowy ghost of youth again.” And in his
verses, too
The white lagoon gives forth no sound,
No whisper stirs the trees behind,
And silence, thick with fears, has bound
Beneath its spell the darkened mind,
A lone bird makes the life-blood start,
A dead twig falling shakes the heart.
The quality of The Forerunners appeal’s
higher than its intrinsic worth merits, be-
cause even Vance Palmer’s slightest poem is
fastidiously fashioned. He reaches no
heights, but he makes the plains liis own. He
is not a great poet, but an admirable minor,
secure in his modest niche in Australian
literature. Here, for a final taste, is the
conclusion of his “Requiem” :
He has lived , he has had his day:
He has gambled more than enough,
And his ways and his speech were rough,
He fought and squandered his pay,
Drinking till daion teas grey;
But his horse and he were as one,
He never went back on a friend,
A/nd he loved one girl to the end....
The task he was set is done,
Carry him home from the run.
A literary event eagerly awaited by a
large and discerning reading public is tbe
forthcoming publication of the collected
Songs of a Sentimental Bloke, by C. J.
Dennis. Angus and Eobertson will publish
this volume, in lordly fashion, with Hal Gye
decorations and a Henry Lawson foreword,
for 3s. 6d.
Boyd Cable, author of By Blow and Kiss,
now doing his bit at the Front, reports pro-
gress : “When I landed in London three
years ago, I was utterly unknown as a
writer, although I had been published in
most Australian journals. I wrote my first
novel (pure, all-wool Australian) after
arrival, and sold book rights to the second
publisher who saw it. London Magazine
bought serial rights and ran it; and U.S.
rights were taken by a good-class mag.
Before and since that I have sold short
stories and verse to a mmed lot of London
editors. Now I think my agents hold about
three short stories and two poems unsold.
Lvery other line I’ve written I’ve sold, some
at poor prices—although none so noor as
some Australian— and some at good fat
figures Now at the Front I could sell a
great deal more than I’ve time to write.
My experience may be a cheering note to
Australian writers who ha/e probably been
told (as I was) that an Australian story
or novel was heavily handicapped simply
because it was Aus. Fortunately I found
good and honest agents to handle my stuff.
They charged me nothing except commission
on stuff sold. ’
“Jean Sibi”: At the risk of protracting a
controversy let me speak a word or two.
I remember my delighted astonishment
when “Harrison O.” having viewed The
Voyscy Inheritance, realised the true calibre
oi. an inferior dramatic craftsman called
Granville Barker. At the time (B(
26/10/’ll) “Harrison” told us with all his
bashful pride in his discovery coloring his
prose that he had “come to the conclusion
that the only tiling necessary for Granville
Barker and his satellites to do, if they
desire to acquire a fair measure of popu-
larity, is to learn the art of playwriting.”
Also “Granville Barker has mistaken his
thin jet of talent for genius, and thinks
that he can, in consequence, overlook the
rules of the game. He may be a lot of the
things his admirers claim for him, but judged
on The Voysey Inheritance he is not a ptay-
wiight.” You can imagine my grief on
reading Red Page 26/8/T5 that “Harrison”
is now “ yettiny tired of these critical snorts
to the effect” that Barker and some others
“may be various admirable things but are
‘not dramatists.’ ” I can only blame a fatal
memory for masterpieces for having recalled
“O’s” early well-reasoned onslaught on
Barker to demonstrate its consistent sup-
port of his later opinion of the same author.
And I think I would apologise for my re-
searches if I had not accidentally encoun-
teied a more cheering example of “Harri-
son’s” unchangeable attitude to the drama
of our time. In the same par. wherein he
published his fatigue he declared: “It should
be only necessary to name one play, Mile-
stones (in the making of which a minor
dramatic hack played a minor part) to
show that Bennett’s claim to be considered
a leading dramatist is by no means con-
temptible. This comedy was one of the
charming and thoroughly artistic
things seen here for years, and the Red
Page itself has said as much.” Turn up
Pov. Point 24/4/’l3 and one will find Mile-
stones swept aside with the shout: “What
a fine example of commercial art Mile-
stones is.” I venture to suggest that there
is a slight shade of difference between a
“fine example of commercial art” and “one
of the most charming and thoroughly
artistic things seen here for years,” though
I feel sure our young friend would endeavor
te disclose in one of his weekly lectures
that there is some unsuspected synonymity
in his critical terms.
[This page’s intimation of “Hhrrison O.” that it
would be pleased to hear from him again when
Bennett has produced a play up to the level of three
plays by Knoblauch still stands. He has apparently
overlooked this paternal advice. However, he admits:
(1) That he does not look upon Enoch as a Heaven-
born genius; (2) Knoblauch’s The Faun has received
something in the nature of critical respect in quar-
ters worth considering, and that it has certain
bizarre qualities which attracted a small amount of
more or less favorable attention. But lie wishes to
intimate: (1) that Marie-Odile was received in London
with a chorus of critical scoffs (Hardly!) and was
withdrawn in a very short time (True) ; (2) that
Kismet is a pot-boiler, probably regarded by the
author as merely an excuse for a display of the
glad haberdashery of Oscar Asche. Finally, firmlv
but courteously he wishes to remark “Rats!”]

CLEMENTS TONIC, LID. . „ .
“My restoration to perfect health has been so wonderful
that I feel that I cannot let this opportunity pass without
letting you know for the benefit of other people the wonderful
results of Clements Tonic. „
“For about five years I SUFFERED DREADFULLY PROAI
NERVOUS BREAKDOWN and INSOMNIA. The least thing
would send my whole body into a tremble. I would shake all
over.
“I tried medical treatment, but I gradually grew worse.
I could not eat or sleep. I HAD GIVEN UP ALL HOPE OP
EVER BEING WELL AGAIN, when a friend advised me to
try Clements Tonic.
“There is no need to tell people who saw me two years
ago, and who can see me now, of the wonderful results of
Clements Tonic, for from the first bottle I commenced to get
better, and after 1 had taken six bottles I WAS RESTORED
TO MY PRESENT STATE OP' 1 HEALTH, WHICH IS PERFECT.

A Great REMEDY for
BLADDER TROUBLE.
Drinking water that is of bad quality or
too soft often causes bladder trouble. Kveij
sufferer tortured with the agonising burning
pains of bladder inflammation (cystitis)
should try a harmless remedy which gives
relief in ninety-nine cases out ot every hun-
dred in a way that can only be described as
miraculous. . . ,
This torture and pain is caused through
germs in the bladder. De 'Witt’s Kidney
and Bladder Pills contain a very stiong.
yet marvellously soothing antiseptic, which
Kidney&BladderPills
| These Pills also act on the Zi \rer. |
k NOT GENUINE WITHOUTTHIS SIGNATURE
penetrates the diseased tissues, attacks and
destroys the germs, makes the urine after a
time bright and clean, bringing a wonderful,
quick sense of relief and ease.
If you are troubled' with rheumatism,
gout, gravel, backache, tired feeling, dropsy,
[‘right's disease, constipation, cloudy urine,
inflammation of the bladder, or other
symptoms of urinary trouble you should
give this wonderful remedy a trial imme-
diately, because it brings quick relief, almost
every time —guaranteed—and a sure cure
follows in most cases.
To cure rheumatism or any other form
of kidney trouble you must positively get
rid of the cause —the poisonous uric acid.
Remember to do this a real remedy must
pass through the kidneys and the bladder
and not through the bowels, as most kidney
pills do. When you see the urine change
to a muddy bluish color—a feature which
distinguishes I*e Witt’s Kidney and Bladder
Pills from all others —you know beyond all
doubt that they have put their healing touch,
on the right spot—the kidneys and the
bladder. A wonderful pill—straight to the
kidneys—that is why Re Witt’s Pills give
such amazingly quick relief —every time.
A permanent cure follows in almost every
case. 1.0 k for that blue-colored urine.
Don't waste a single hour. Go to your
chemist at once and ask him for a 2s. Od.

STOP
SMOKING!
MOST MEN would cure themselves of the
Tobacco habit if they knew they could
do so easily and without discomfort.
It takes but ten minutes for tobacco to
change the beats of the heart. To keep it up
is to tempt death by Heart Disease, Nervous
Collapse, Tobacco Cancer, and Stomach,
T.iver or Kidney Disease.
TOBACCO SPECIFIC is a harmless, vege-
table remedy that will make the user of
tobacco in any form absolutely abandon the
habit for good. It not only destroys the crav-
ing the desire, the appetite for tobacco, but
restores to health the entire nervous system,
and aids nature in entirely eliminating from
the system the Nicotine Poison.

Because I loved you so I gave my heart
For ever into your indulgent keeping;
Because you used Love’s own resistless art,
I shared with you what honors 1 was
reaping.
Because you promised and I took your word
The course is set until the way is ended:
Because you pleaded and I, ling'ring. heard
Your heart by mine must always be de-
fended.
I do not grudge the work: for work I live;
1 would not murmur if my cares were
doubled ;
But why should you, who've nought but
love to give,
Withhold that love and see me pained and
troubled ?
I work too hard —I don’t work hard enough!
According to your mood I vex or please
you.
If man were made of more than human stir It
lie might. O Woman, of your torment
ease you!
Yet we must pace as equal beings through
What avenues of years may stretch before
us,
While I am always I; but, Woman, you
Resemble more a shrill, discordant chorus.
What devil lurks behind your honest eyes
And films your sight with hate? 1 cannot
follow
The sex-imp that makes fools of women wise.
Mocking true love with laughter drear and
hollow.
What mystery of madness is it drives
Your childlike heart to passionate resent-
ment,
So that all joy is banished from our lives
That yesterday seemed lapped in soft con-
tentment?
O sullen prisoner trudging at my side,
Are you that happy voyager was singing
Here next my heart in thankfulness and
pride?
Where is your song that, was so lately
ringing ?

Pledge Me!
Pledge me the loves that come ! Not those
which go.
Pallid and sick, like breath of last year s
flower;
Ilunnels wherein the stream has ceased to
flow,
Grey evening blanched of noonday’s golden
hour.
Pledge me not memories, but. let me stand
Heart pressed to heart, and lip a-cling to lip.
Where is the comfort of a ghostly hand ?
In the shut flower what honey-dew to sip?
Pledge me the wine I pour into the glass,
Not the dry stain upon mahogany
Where last night saw the tinted fingers
pass;
To-day’s dull empty bowl a-brim to me !
Pledge me no written word on paper cold.
No eyes that dream regrets long miles away;
Give me no minting of the sped hour’s gold:
Pledge me the kisses that are mine to-day!
For does the bread of last week satisfy?
Tim drink of last month quench your palate’s
drouth?
Pledge me the answering challenge of an eye
And the compelling nearness of a mouth !

“No. 19."
Up from the warm, moist earth
Steamed a scent that I knew,
And I saw a belt of gum trees
’Gainst a sky-line of greying blue—
Lupin and gorse and gum trees —
Like the sting of a lash on my Drain;
“No. 19,” in a file,
Tramping along in the rain.
God, but the brand is on me, for all eter-
nity !
Oh, I'm not whining about it, for the law is
sane and just.
Why should they mete us mercy,
We who were false to our trust?
But I hear the wind in the; gum trees,
With its high and gallant refrain :
“No. 19, tree-planting,”—-
Stopped work, because of the rain.
Oh, the summer nights in their shadow,
With the moon like a rose in the sky,
While a faint breeze came from the valley.
Like a tired moth fluttering by.
When youth and the stars were with mo,
And Victory was in my train —•
Middle-aged and arrow-branded.
Head bent in the drifting rain !
Why must my heart be broken
By a scent from the warm, moist earth?
Wet lupin, given as token
Of love, and belief in my worth !
A girl from the saddle bending—•
I must never see her again.
“No. 19, tree-planting,”
Tramping along in the rain!

THE GREAT AUSTRALIAN CADGE.
These demented borrowers of ours have
lately been gathered together again at
Melbourne seeking to devise a co-operative
scheme for getting hold of more loan in
order, it is hilariously explained, to “keep
things going.” That they wfere conspiring
to lessen the nation’s ability to meet the
strain of war bothered them not at all. They
have built their own hopes of political salva-
tion* on borrow and boom; they have so
demoralised their supporters that the road
and the bridge and Cohen can alone save
their skins. And as the saving of theiV own
political skins is much more important than
the national ability to stand up to the strain
of the war, they went to Melbourne to
devise schemes for getting £20,000,000 some-
how or anyhow.
The loan transactions entered into by the
Australian States have been disgraceful
enough in the past, Heaven knows; but that
the great cadge should be waged with un-
abated fury in the second year of a war in
which the credit of every country concerned
is being strained to the uttermost is too
calamitous for words. Australia’s manhood
has responded splendidly to the call to arms.
The people have subscribed generously to
every appeal made to their purse. But what
has the Australian politician done? Mostly
he has gone full speed ahead as if the world’s
expenditure of life and money was a mere
irrelevancy compared with the erection of a
new railway-station, the building of orna-
mental lakes at a disastrous dusthole like
Canberra, or the construction of new mon-
key-cages at a Zoo. He has spent and
borrowed every sixpence he could lay hands
on, as if the sun was bright and everybody
was going to the races and the angel of
peace was filling in a claim on the old-age
pension. Not a sign of voluntary economy
can be detected among the politicians con-
trolling the administrative machine any-
where in the whole Commonwealth. All of
them are whining for loans; each separate
group is maintaining expenditure at the
highest point that can be reached by taxa-
tion, the employment of shindykits and
surreptitious visits to the pawnshop. What
patriotic Australian can contemplate without
disgust these hucksters now snivelling to
John Bull for an eleemosynary dole —pro-
claiming to the world that Australians are
the one set of people on earth who cannot
support themselves by their own industry!
The painful realism of this anti-climax to
the policy of “developing our great natural
resources is fearsome to look upon.
For years the country has been casually
watching politicians fling round the pro-
ceeds of borrowings for which the obligation
to repay had been fastened to the neck of
succeeding generations. Public policy has
found a base not upon the sound foundation
of work to-day but upon such unstable
security as is afforded by pawning the pro-
spects of to-morrow. The end of the dread-
ful thing had to come some time, and the
time is dead ripe for it to end now if Aus-
tralia is to emerge from the importing rut
®he found herself in when the war arrived
if she is going to abandon the rQle of wood-
and-water-joey and get away from the lean-
ing post. Last season’s drought diminished
the national earnings by millions. The wal-
ls taking heavy_ toll of Australian life and
sending the national debt aeroplaning to a
height that is yet indefinite. The expendi-
ture ip that.direction this year will run into
o\er £50,000,000. The interest bill is leap-
ing up like a rocket. Every consideration
of national safety demands the exercise of a
rigid public _ economy and the saving of
e\ery pound in expenditure which cannot be
justified on the ground of positive and pre-
sent necessity. Yet in both the Federal and
btate domain ordinary expenditure is as
prodigal as it was before the war. The
cost of Parliaments and Governors and all
the trimmings and trappings of government
is of itself one of the wonders of the age.
The drain of interest is appalling. The
importation of luxuries purchased with the
p.n. lias in recent years grown to colossal
dimensions. Civil services have expanded
to dropsical proportions. The scandals
associated with the expenditure of loans
and the appropriation by private indivi-
duals of the fictitious values thereby created
have been so many that they form topics of
amazed- discussion from Carpentaria to the
Leeuwin. And the things that loans have
been expended on—in Westralia on repairs
t>) glass houses and on soup for immigrants!
That the knife should have been put into
this distended bubble long ago is not denied
by any experienced financier or economist.
The price Australia will pay if the imple-
ment is withheld much longer is not to be
lightly thought of.
The hope of Australia rests now where it
was before and where every other country
lias found strength—in the productivity of
its lands, of its workshops and its mines;
in the energy and enterprise and courage of
the people. In the unclean debauch of the
past this has been lost sight of, and the
country has developed a race of political
humbiigs who imagine that the national
progress and the happiness of the people
depend upon the amount of debt they can
dredge from Cohen’s pocket and scatter
about as bait for votes. Therefore it hap-
pens that with the roar of cannon in their
ears and the public footing a war bill of
unexampled magnitude Australian politi-
ticians are actually trying to squeeze money
out of hard-pressed John Bull to be spent
on frills and utterly unnecessary works and
the purchase of political support. It is
blazing hypocrisy that men who would ho
guilty of thus weakening the nation’s ability
t> pursue the war should talk about a
recruiting campaign. Their place is among
the eriemies of the country, not among its
friends.
12-INCH GUNS AND 15-INCH
MUDDLE.
But for a confusion of plans Xerxes should
have conquered Greece ; but for the muddle
after the battle of Ligny, Waterloo would
have had : another ending. Had the German
strategy been carried out according to sched-
ule Pans would now be in the hands of the-
Kaiser; had the British war organisation
been the thing it should have been, there
would have been no retreat from Mons.
These are statements requiring no proof; but
from such data nobody seems prepared to
generalise, and there has been no attempt to
treat war muddle in a scientific fashion. Yet
if all campaigns could be analysed it would
bo found that muddle is always a
factor, ! a factor varying in quantity
and quality, but as much a part of the war-
god’s general outfit as blood or red-cross ban-
dages. It is for this reason that paper
strength is never actually battle strength,
and that the big game of nations is full of
those surprises which cause the general read-
ing public to reverse its pre-conceived ideas
so often that the universal brain acquires
the habits of a lightning-change artist.
* * * *
Yet the muddle inseparable from war-
fare is easily understood. The war machine
is invented, improved and re-constructed in
times of peace. The military officers who
are the cogs in that machine are practically
untried men when the wheels begin to
turn. They have gained their promotion
by outliving their fellows or by showing
ability in service which is altogether differ-
ent from that for which they are alleged to
be trained. Behind them is an office which
in the settled calm between great wars
naturally becomes sleepy and grows old and
fat from lack of .exercise. Over the whole,
and in command of all. is a ring of politi-
cians to whom war is a side issue, and the
delicate handling of voters, money-lenders
or nrinces the main business of life. It
follows that when the gage of battle is actu-
ally hurled on the floor and a full head of
the steam of national enthusiasm is turned
into the complicated machinery, there is an
immediate call for renairs or adjustments
to the mechanism. These repairs or adjust-
ments must be carried out by mechanics
who have never previously worked at their
trade while the cranks and pinions are try-
ing to run at top speed. As a result, things
are sure to happen which should never have
happened, and things which should have
happened foraret to take place. Chance
enters in where intense calculation was
supposed to have eliminated the fickle ani-
mal. and nothing remains certain except the
quality of the steam which drives. Of
course, it sometimes happens that a break
in the machinery causes a few splinters to
fly which may catch the enemy in the
midriff, or a more vital break in the enemy’s
machine mav obscure the fact that our
own is broken; but, taking it by and large,
in the stress of conflict the war wheels are
bound to wobble, and the war bearings to
run hot in spite of all the plans laid when
the shrapnel was asleep and the 12-inch
guns looked as harmless as telegraph poles.
« * * *
In connection with the war now making
Europe unclean it may quite reasonably be
said that the military machinery of the five
chief nations engaged in the struggle virtu-
ally broke down shortly after the first bump.
The big fight has resolved itself largely into
a mechanical competition, and final victory
lies with the side which can fastest and best
repair its mistakes. This was inevitable.
War on such an immense scale was previ-
ously unknown to humanity. Previous cam-
paigns conducted by small armies operating
along narrow fronts afforded no guide to the
angry nations. Now we know; and the
mechanic, backed by the drill-sergeant and
the knitter of battle socks, is toiling over-
time to turn that knowledge into holes in
the enemy’s line. Muddle begins to give
place to settled order. Yet if peace were
declared to-morrow and a new war on the
same scale broke out 25 years lienee, it is
safe to say that the same muddle and con-
fusion would mark the early weeks of the
struggle.
*** ' »
Muddle must henceforth be looked upon
•as a regular and unavoidable item in the
war programme. It is for the nation that
regards itself seriously to take full account
of this, and turn the thing that might be
in the nature of a calamity into something
like an asset. This can be done by a proper
system of calculation. Thus, to take a simple
example, in considering the possibilities of
an invasion in force of the Northern Terri-
tory .at the .present moment, let us suppose
that our militarv authorities estimate a
garrison of 20,000 men at Port Darwin as
sufficient for the purpose. Let us give all
due consideration to that reckoning; but let
us also remember that as our military
authorities have never had any experience
of the defence of a continent like Australia,
something must be added to their estimate.
Let x stand for the thing our miiitai'y ex-
perts do not know. But 20,000 men+x does
not complete the sum of our requirements,
for there is Andrew Fisher to take into
account. Andrew Fisher may be no worse
and no better than another Prime Minister
in grasping the significance of a military
point. name will do as well as a worse
one to indicate the political control which
complicates effort in the foughten field;
and as this item cannot be left out of the
calculation, let , y represent the thing
Andrew Fisher cannot grasp. The figures
now stand at 20,000 men+x+y. And still
the sum is incomplete. To get at a true
result it is necessary to multiply the whole
by the unavoidable factor of muddle conse-
quent upon a sudden mobilisation of our
forces. Let this muddle be represented by
a. Then the final equation must stand
something like this: g {20,000 men + x+y) =
the force necessary to protect the Northern
Territory. The proper values of x and y
must be left to. actuarial experts in mili-
tary incapacity and Ministerial ineptitude,
while the full significance of s may be
arrived at bv adding the imnortance of the
direct railway from Oodnadatta to Pine
Creek to the length of the Northern Terri-
tory coastline, and multiplying by the num-
ber of camels necessary tc transport an
army corps to, the point of greatest danger.
The total result will give us some idea of the
thing we may be compelled to undertake
for the adequate nrotection of a single por-
tion of this continent.
* * * -•■ *
But apart from all exact or inexact cal-
culations of this kind, the acceptance of the
great principle of inevitable muddle in war
arrangements must make for better prepara-
tion. It is not sufficient to have enough
men, weapons and ammunition to equal
those of our opponents, and then trust to
luck to pull us through. We must have a
supply of these necessary things sufficient to
defeat the enemy even if those in authority
among us show the absolute maximum of
incapacity and carry out their work in the
worst possible way. Up to the present, in
matters of national defence we have gone
along on the easy assumption that we have
lots of time, and that somehow or other
thinvs will right themselves in the end.
Now the European wrangle has opened our
eyes on the time question, and we know with
what suddenness the roar of battle’follows
on the first clang of the war-gong. The
mere statement of the arguments that were
popular a year or two ago raises’ a grim
smile. It may be true that the European
war has given us a breathing space, but our
big problems are all before us still, and the
doom of the unready must be ours if we fail
to learn the lesson that Britain, France,
Russia and Germany are forcing under our
national nose. Just now our business is to
a'd. by every means in our power, the forces
that are striving to knock the spike out of the
German hat; but once that end is achieved
our own house remains to have its ..bolts and
bars set in order against any possible burg-
lar. If we go to work honestly and sanely
to make Australia invasion-proof we may
yet win through to national safety. The
war census must become a regular institu-
tion. We must organise to the last man
and the last detail. The work left undone in
the matter of railway construction and 'the
standardisation of our railway gauges must
be neglected no longer. Our naval ship-
building must be continued on an increasing
scale, and an aerial service must be pro-
perly organised. Then when we have done
all that seems possible, let us take fiill
account of the factor of muddle and try Ao
do still more. s
* * * # 1
To take full account of muddle as a fac-
tor in war is to greatly reduce its danger.
The muddler -in time of peace must be
sternly dealt with. It is only then that we
have time to deal with him. Modern war
is so dependent upon the preparations of the
previous time of calm that in some sense
the battles are decided in the workshop and
war council years before a shot is fired.
We cannot eliminate muddle, but we can
attempt to reduce it to a minimum. We
cannot guarantee that our war machine will
run smoothly when put to the test, hut we
can try to make it large enough and strong
enough and flexible enough to serve our
purpose even if handled as a cow might
handle a toasting fork. Hitherto the idea
of our talkative and complacent politicians
has been that any kind of defence force
which might stall off the desire of the
electors for a real citizen army would see
us through comfortably until the next poll.
That sort of trifling with truth has had its
day. A force muddle-proof against the
worst possible contingency is what Australia
will demand the moment the European guns
are silent.
THE PRIVILEGE OF BEING FREE
TO STRIKE.
After all, it is just as well that, being what
it is, the N.S.W. Government should pro-
pose to repeal the law imposing penalties
for strikes and lock-outs, as indicated the
other day by Labor-Minister Estell. As
it stands now this part of the Conciliation
and Arbitration Act is a laughing-stock.
Ministers are afraid of it. They sit from
day to day cowering before unions which
snap their fingers at fines and penalties
imposed by the Courts. Not only are they
afraid to collect these fines, but they are
scared to put the law against strikes
into motion, and are actually in the position
of people who connive at breaches of a
statute. Morally their status is no better
than if they winked at felony or impeded
the police when proceeding against the pro-
prietor of a faked scales or against Bung
for a breach of the licensing laws. A Minis-
try in such a hole as this has before it only
two possible lines of action, after the scandal
has grown sufficiently smellful to call for
interment. One is to get out and make way
for more honest men; the other to repeal the
law and clear themselves from the obliga-
tions of their office. Laws passed to control
human conduct in any direction, whether it
be with regard to striking, or embezzling
trust funds, or punching inoffensive citizens
on the nose, or failing to vote at a plebiscite,
become incitements to offending if they are
not put into effect. They bring all law into
ridicule. They may become mediums of
extortion, fraud and oppression in the hands
of the unscrupulous. Therefore it .'is well
that the N.S.W. Ministry should even at the
eleventh hour rid the country of what is at
once a pitiful spectacle and a public danger.
* # * *
Whether it will be a wise thing for Par-
liament to repeal those sections of the Arbi-
tration Act spoken of by Estell, rather than
insist upon their enforcement, is another
matter. To party politicians dependent
upon the vote of electors who want liberty
to strike whenever they feel that way; to
the politician who wants a return to, the
good old times when there was no Arbitra-
tion Act to interfere with Fat ; to the
happy-go-lucky individual who wants a quiet
life and looks upon the whole business as a
nuisance—-to all of these people the Minis-
terial bolt will come as a blessed relief. To
people who had looked upon the arbitration
system, with all its imperfections, as some-
thing infinitely better than the chaos it
superseded, its emasculation to save the skin
of a handful of party hacks is something in
the nature of a tragedy. It . will be
particularly so to that great body of more
or less defenceless labor which has found in
the Act its sole measure of protection
against heartless exploitation. To big. power-
ful bodies such as the Miners’ Unions the Act
was of comparatively little use, and it is
they who have scrapped it, not because they
suffered injustice, not because any other sec-
tion of workers were oppressed, but because
of the irritation they felt at being made par-
ties to a contract which had to be observed
on pain of penalty. A system of compul-
sory arbitration, by which public authority
is invoked to hold the scales between em-
ployer and worker, is, however, not worth a
rabbit-skin unless it can compel the parties
to the award to observe its terms. Without
this power in reserve either side may be’vic-
timised by the other. and the public be taken
down by both. This was learned early in
the experiment of State intervention, and to
now pitch the safeguard overboard amounts
to confession that the State is impotent to
restrain industrial upheavals, and that, after
all, I.W.W. methods are the ones through
which the worker and the employer can best
settle their multifarious differences. That
a collection of Labor apostates should pro-
pose to do this at a moment when the miners
of the State are tnreatening strike, and thus
make the way clear for a large, comprehen-
sive riot free from interference, is of course
only a mere detail.
* * * A ' *
The net meaning of it all is that arbitra
tion goes into the dustbin. A pretence, of
course, will be made to keep life in the dis-
embowelled remains, but nobody is going to
be deceived by that, nor is the way of the
Commonwealth extending its functions in the
industrial arena going to be made any easier
by Labor in N. S. Wales kicking out the
linch-pin of public authority. And with
the Prevention of strikes and lock-outs de-
clared to be outside the rightful functions of
the State, and striking pronounced to be a
legitimate form of moral suasion, the doctrine
ot preference to unionists will soon wear a
mighty queer look, too.' In fact, the whole
argument which justified the State in setting
up machinery for' the settlement of indus-
trial disputes is going to be upended, and
turned inside out and made to appear like a
jocular reminiscence. When employers and
workmen go back to the bad old days of bash
and uproar—which to men who remember
those times are like a bad dream —and when
ships’ crews are idle because the miners are
losing wages, and wharf-lumpers are decorat-
ing the streets because there are no vessels
moving, and the nation’s business is con-
ducted in a series of spasms, then the wis-
dom of indulging in all this luxury will
appeal to the community as just the same
fantastic tomfoolery as it did when the dis-
ruption of trade was one of the privileges of
Fat. The immediate future looks like a
particularly bad time for experiments in this
direction, anyhow.


PLAIN ENGLISH.
Strategy, or Treason?
The talk of strategic railways is again heard
in official, places, and the States are being
asked to fall in with some scheme —probably
the Nowhere-to-Brisbane notion with which
Andrew Fisher was stung some time ago.
Australia’s main strategic railway, which
has been so long delayed, requires no sanc-
tion from the States. It is purely a Common-
wealth affair to which the Federation by its
agreement with South Australia is definitely
pledged, and in regard to which Federal Min-
isters have so far shirked and hedged to a
disgraceful extent. To divert money from the
direct railway linking up the North and
South to .some other line leading to the
Prime Minister’s political back yard would
be nothing short of a national crime. If the
whole of Australia is to be defended the
Northern Territory must be brought into
railway communication with the closely-
settled parts of the country as speedily as
possible. The alleged strategic railway which
was mooted some months ago cannot by any
stretch of imagination be designed for the
defence of the whole continent. Its only value
could be to enable beaten Australian troops
to make a stand against an enemy in posses-
sion of the northern portion of the continent
in order to save Sydney, Melbourne and a
few other places in the south east. The man
who at the present moment regards a rail-
way for the purpose of saving a part of Aus-
tralia from the invader as having the first
call on the public purse has already calmly
contemplated the yielding to the foe of halt
the Commonwealth territory. Such contem-
plation is plain treason. We have a right to
demand that our statesmen should be big
enough to see the Australian continent as
a whole, and if Andrew Fisher is not big
enough for that vision he is of no use to us
as a director of our national destinies. Let
first things be done first. To coyer the whole
map with strategic railways might be a de-
sirable thing in years to come, but the vital
arterial connection between the South and
the northern point of greatest danger, even
though there are no voters to be conciliated
by the construction of the line, is of para-
mount importance. The trouble with the
present Prime Minister is that he has never
learned to think in terms of a continent. He
is still a politician and no statesman. The
probability of his early retirement may add
something like a tragic note to his strategic
railway folly. If the money which should go
to construct the Northern Territory line is
wasted on a minor and less important work,
the great future, ignoring his good quali-
ties and all his past services, may yet write
the word traitor black against his name on
the national record.
The Great Freedom of Belgium.
Among the current objections to compulsory
service in defence of national freedom have a
look at this one. It is advanced by Tunne-
cliffe, a member of the Victorian Assembly:
I am opposed to conscription because the. nation
which adopts compulsory methods has little freedom
worth fighting for.
Having looked at Tunnecliffe’s “because”
long enough to take in its majesty, have a
look at Europe. Is France not worth the
efforts her people are making to throw the
invader out? According to Tunnecliffe she
isn’t. He may be right; but he certainly
Svon’t get one Frenchman in a million to
agree with him. The only belligerent Conti-,
nental country that was without a system of
national defence was Belgium; and if the
history of the Belgian people during the last
12 months can be taken as an . example of
what a country gains by rejecting national
service, and the history .of France during the
same period can be accepted as proof of what.
is lost by a nation adopting such a system, it
seems up to Tunnecliffe to find some better
reason than his windy denial of the obvious.
The indisputable facts are that had Belgium
been ready to defend herself there would
have been* no German Governor in Brussels
to-day : on the other hand, had France not
been prepared to put her manhood in the
field, the Crown Prince would long ago have
been posing before a Paris photographer.
Unless the war news is being censored by a
professional humorist the inevitable concl -
Sion is that the only people still free on tne
European continent, and participating in tne
fray, are those which were ready to rush ou
with a gun. The others are getting soup
tickets from an army of occupation.
China and Munitions.
The people who are suggesting that Ah
Millions, of the Chinese Republic, should
be employed to make munitions tor tne
Allies are probably only fools, but tneir
folly is of that dangerous kind which mattes
it twin brother to the seven deadly sins and
first cousin to national suicide. Ages ago a
great Asiatic empire discovered that tne
men of the small Greek States could tight
better than anything then offering, and gave
them jobs in its armies. The Greeks so
employed went home with the news that
Asiatic persons who were only very moder-
ate soldiers, and at the same time consider-
able shirks, had conquered more territory
than any Greek had even looked at. Asa
result, a few years later, Alexander, the
great military larrikin of antiquity, led his
Greek and Macedonian spears over the
stomach of the bloated and fallen Persian
Empire, and in 11 short years brought all he
could find of Asia under European dominion.
Had the Persian never employed the Greek
to do his fighting there would probably have
been no Macedonian Empire. Now we pro-
pose—or some noisy persons among us
propose —to repeat the same sort of tolly in
the case of China. It may be perfectly true
that China has great natural advantages for
munition making and could turn out wai
stuff faster and better than anybody else;
but that is the best of all reasons for not
asking her to do it. While the Chinaman is
growing cabbages and weaving silk _ and
learning the difficult art of constitutional
government, he is a harmless and not un-
pleasant object of contemplation. The China-
man master of the world’s greatest munition-
making plant would be a very different pro-
position. He doesn’t desire to make muni-
tions and has no warlike, intentions of his
own, so, in the name of his lost pigjau,
why stir him up to take a hand in the hor-
rible game at which he might readily win to
fame as chief murderer of the planet?
The Psychology of the Soldier.
“J. Jingle” looks under his skin: —
When a young man enlists for war—l’Ve done it
more than once, so 1 know what I am talking about
—he gives himself up in so complete a sense that
the state of mind he presently falls into is incom-
prehensible to people who have never taken the big
job on. Every other responsibility the man ever had
he drops in one comprehensive bundle. After a time
he. finds that the big job rides very lightly compared
with the worry of the multitudinous little things
that he has jettisoned. He finds that he has nothing
on earth to do but to do what he is told, and do it
a little quicker and better each time. He comes
up, after plunging potentially through the “Valley
of the Shadow,” into a new world where thinking
is not only unnecessary but something very near
an offence. Consequently when he is not at work
getting through a lot of strain and stress perfecting
himself for usefulness in the Valley, the man is
completely at a loose end. In order to get him up
fit for fight his whole mental and bodily develop-
ment is thrown out of gear. This loose-end condi-
tion has very varying effects upon different temper-
aments/and the fighting prospect adds to the num-
ber and variety of the effects. It is, in fact, a
sudden metamorphosis, and requires very careful
handling. As a rule, it gets a very careless handling.
Just sit down and think about it, and you’ll see
that there is no place on earth like an army in
trainirg for good men to make bad men good, and
for bad men to make good men bad, each in record
time. That is why the young soldier wants a lot
of very careful shepherding- in the matter of drink
and women and other things. You want to remem-
ber all the time that a youngster doesn't make for
the Valley voluntarily without having thought
about it quite a lot. Having taken the plunge,
which is perhaps the last thing he is ever going to
do entirely on his own, all worries come to a dead
finish, and he is a mere human atom to which if
you say “Have a drink?” the reply is: “Why, cer-
tainly.” That’s why he wants guarding; and guard
him all you can, say old soldiers of the right sort.
You can fill the decent old soldier up with shrap-
nel and it doesn’t hurt like seeing a “rookie” drunk
in the street and the police talking to him. Never-
theless don’t cut him off drink ; never tell the man
that has been used to a glass of something that he’s
going to have none. The motto of all good generals
is, “See that he has his beer, and give him if
he gets too much.” Do not listen to the wowser
in this matter. He doesn’t know. Nobody does
who hasn't been there, though even those who
haven’t been there might perhans acknowledge now
that the super-fitness of the 150,000 or so Britishers
whom French took over at the beginning of things
saved the situation. And those men were brought
up on beer, and French, or somebody else, saw
that they had their tot of rum at intervals subse-
quently—not for any sentimental reason, but
because he knew the situation called for it.
Amsterdam, Athens and Ananias all
begin with A, and have more resemblance
still. It was Amsterdam that told us, after
the hold-up at the Marne, thot Germany
had ammunition enough for only a few
weeks at most. Athens has never ceased
telling us of the famished, mutinous and
altogether desperate condition of the Turks,
also of the scuttling of Germans from Con-
stantinople beyond range of all the deadly
weapons aimed at them by their infuriated
dupes. Even after the Russians were
booted off the Carpathians and driven
across Poland, and the attack on the Darda-
nelles proved a fiasco, and the French and
English line in France and Belgium was
moved a little forward here and a little
back there with cruel losses to the attackers,
in the long disappointment of that Spring
offensive, the cable analogies of Ananias
continued their assaults upon our reason.
Athens tried a shocker to the effect that
owing to the presence of German submarines
the British warships were withdrawn from
Gallipoli and our armies thus abandoned
were in a terrible plight. Then it admin-
istered an intoxicant in the form of a report
that our cruisers were through the Darda-
nelles. Amsterdam ran up to a very tall
yarn of German reinforcements in France
consisting altogether of deaf mutes directed
by gestures! The whole kin of Ananias
appears to be German. These agencies have
one purpose—to delay the adoption of
national service in the British Empire by
fooling it into easy negligence or despair.
Luckily they work on the assumption that
everybody not a German is already a fool.

“Chug” : Whether we foolishly chop down
and burn valuable timber or not, I hope
G.-G. Ferguson will keep on bairacking
for a school of Australian forestry and
national tree-planting. To the individual
planter tree-growing does not make a tre-
mendous appeal, because, unless he has the
patriarchal instinct strongly developed, to
put money into loans to futurity which bear
no interest but a good conscience seems like
immediate waste. At the same time, there
is nothing in which the State could invest
money offering anything like the same re-
turn. Our ever-borrowing Governments, in
particular, might well go into the matter of
planting their sinking funds where sun and
rain will guarantee their growth. If a
Holman would give an undertaking that for
every pound he draws from Cohen or. his
understudies to keep his political pot boiling
he would plant five good timber trees , in a
State forest, the public could look with, a
good deal more confidence to the financial
future. Those trees would stand for a pro-
mise that at some distant day the baby
would at last be taken out of pawn with
all interest paid and the ticket destroyed—
provided you could prevent all future
Holmans from pawning the sinking fund.
And there are other aspects of forestry
worth considering. We are assured by men
of science that better bread than we now
eat can be produced from various nut trees,
and that the crop per acre from these is
bevond the dreams of any wheat cultivator.
Even as they are used to-day. nuts are in
constant demand at high prices. What
would be the value in 40 years of five thou-
sand acres of State forest, in one of the
cooler districts planted entirely with thin-
shelled walnuts? If Mount Morgans could
be grown from seed like that their future
profits would look small beside the possible
returns of such State ventures: and yet
how we should rush to plant them!
The Westralian Miners’ Federation, which
has three or four Ministers and several
members of Parliament on its roll, has
demanded the abolition of all “rising” under-
ground, except where absolutely necessary,
and then only in four-hour shifts. The
average age of underground workers at
death in the State has got down to 44 years,
and as this shocking record is attributed
to the deadly progress that miners’ com-
plaint is making, the Union considers that
it is about time a move was made to check
the scourge. The appointment of workmen
inspectors to whom the men could and
would speak freely about the conditions of
their mine is also insisted upon. A Bill
to provide for such appointments has passed
the Assembly and is now before the Coun-
cil The Chamber of Mines is vehemently
urging members to throw it out; but the
measure has a good chance of becoming law.
When an industry kills off its workmen at
an average age of 44 it almost seems time
to do something. There have been times
when wild men would even have suggested
hanging the Chamber of Mines if it stood in
the way of improved conditions.

“E.N.M.” nurses his pet corn: —
I see that another cruiser, the Adelaide, is to be
built on the site so long occupied by the Brisbane.
Now, considering that the Brisbane was designed in
1909, and that fashions in naval architecture change
almost as often as fashions in women’s clothes, it is
clearly the duty of Fisher or Jensen, or somebody,
to state definitely whether the proposed new ship is
to be a sister ship, or whether it is to be something
a little more up to date. To ask Australia to accept,
at the end of 1915, a design of early 1909 is not only
- farcical; it is criminal. The war has shown that the
so-called “light cruiser” of ante-bellum days must
take a very much lower place in the naval scale than
was at first anticipated. The new Arethusas of the
Imperial Navy are 35-knot oil-burners, with light
armor, and of marvellous handiness. ■ One of them
world' be more than a match for the 1909 design,
although, the 1915 boat is a good 1600 tons smaller.
They carry the very latest thing in 6in. and 4in.
guns, and with 10-knots more speed, a much smaller
target and increased protection in all vital parts,
they are formidable little ships. They will cost far
less than the Sydney (£886.000); while when one
contemplates the cool million that the Brisbane
going to cost (she has already cost £ 600,000 odd),
it makes one wonder whether, after all, there is not
such a thing as paying too dear for one s whistle.
Nobody is more anxious than I am to see Australia
building her own warships, but for love of country
don’t let us take six years to do what others do in
about six months, or spend £1.000,000 in ordei to
get a £400,000 ship about five years behind the
times. 1 put it to Fisher and Jensen —what would
their wives say if asked, or ordered, to dress in the
fashions of, say, 1910 ?
“P.” on a recent little scandal: —
H. P. Stacey, late of the Commonwealth Naval
Department, whose case was mentioned in The
Bulletin of September 16, had left for England via
America nearly a week previously. As for the re-
mark: “If an official has been sacked for trying to
hurry things when things so badly need to be
hurried, then we should know who the responsible
party is” —well, there is no secret about it. The
Minister who dealt with the transport matter of
nine months ago, and who dismissed Stacey, by
telegram, months after the inquiry had closed, and
who refused Stacey a personal interview in Mel-
bourne when he sent along papers in proof of his
claim to have been “absolutely free from blame —-
the Minister was Jens August Jensen. To what
extent his feelings were swayed by union officials I
cannot say. Stacey’s statement to Jensen con-
tained these pertinent allusions: —
Two union secretaries spoke very bitterly at the
inquiry of the fact that I would not allow good
unionists to work on the transports because they
were of German parentage, and in one case the
secretary of a union told the Assistant Minister that
after 1 had sent men away from a transport pn this
account, he (the union secretary) had given them
good British names, and sent them back to the
transport, where they were taken on.
A telegram from the Defence Department had
warned him to exclude persons of German or Aus-
trian extraction, naturalised or otherwise, and the
union secretaries must have known that Stacey was
only doing his duty in refusing work to men of
enemy parentage. But they were bitter, and
their bitterness seems to have struck a responsive
chord in Jens August Jensen’s heart. The one feas-
ible explanation offering is that they desired to get
Stacey sacked because he was a live man, a clever
“speeder-up”; and Mr. Jensen gave them their
hearts’ desire. This matter ought to be cleared up,
as Tiie Bulletin said. But Stacey is not here to
worry about it. He was much too energetic an Aus-
tralian to stop in Australia wasting time in writing
letters to a Jensen who refused him a hearing.
But the system with which he came in conflict re-
mains behind, and it is costing the country hundreds
of thousands of pounds.

After reviewing the Australians at the Dar-
danelles and the Allies in Flanders, war-
scribblers are getting into the habit of cob*
eluding with a triumphant “Is it possible for
men with a snirit like this to be defeated.
As a literary finale, or a tribute to the courage
of the troops, the remark might pass; but
so far as it tends to give a quite unjustifiable
confidence, it is a habit that should be sup-
pressed. Courage, ol itself, can win no
modern battles. Briton, Belgian. Gaul,
Russian, Teuton, Slav, Italian, Servian,
Turk and Jap have little to reproach them-
selves for in the matter of bravery- War
between what are prematurely styled civi-
lised’’ nations is a matter not ot
this quality but of men and muni-
tions, of organisation and artillery, of
inventive genius and hospitals, of sani-
tation and a multitude of other things
which entail money and brain and muscle
and hard graft and self-sacrifice and intelli-
gent co-operation. It means, in short, that
the crowd wins which can best translate the
triumphs of intellect into. a host of . vital
necessities evolved from gigantic supplies of
raw material. Courage is so common to all
the combatants that it may be almost can-
celled in summing up the assets and liabili-
ties. and anyone who infers that personal
bravery will allow us to slack off in atten-
tion to ammunition, food, machine guns,
aeroplanes, etc., should be treated as a pub-
lic danger, because far too many people are
ready to shirk their legitimate obligations if
they can capture what appears to be a
legitimate excuse.

“Cripps Clark,” in reply:—
“The Curse of ‘Quidam’ ” (B. 23/9/’l5) qualifies
the writer for membership of “The Ancient Order of
Stinking Fishers.” He exalts the Yankee fruit-
growers and curses the local growers with a bitter-
ness suggesting that the bottom of the last bag of
apples he bought from the barrow-man was not up
to the sample on the top. But that wasn’t the
grower’s fault, and is no justification for the sweep-
ing assertion that “each Australian grower packs
his fruit according to a standard of his own, so
that about 200 sizes and qualities can be obtained
from any case labelled ‘Extra Choice’ ” 1 “Quidam”
must surely be thinking of drapery cases; but
N. S. Wales growers don't use them —they pack
apples in standard bushel cases according to the
Act, and every up-to-date grower grades his apples
to the standard favored by the trade, both local
and export. The “extra choice”—3in. to 3iin. —go
about eight dozen to the case, and no grower on the
right side of a lunatic asylum would put that label
on a case of “marbles,” for the fruit trade is as
keen upon inspecting what it is buying as any
other. Anyhow, the large “extra choice” apple is
not the ideal that the grower aims to produce; for
although it is placed in the window the wily Dago
much prefers the medium (2iin.) grade, which gives
him a “good count” per case. The Yankee cer-
tainly scores over the Australian grower in the
matter of refrigerator-cars for the carriage of his
fruit. The Australian can’t even depend upon his
consignment reaching the Sydney market up to time
in any old car, which in the case of soft fruits often
entails heavy, if not total, loss. But, then, what
can one expect from a department that gives our
butter the same flavor as the Yankee grease imported
by Mr. Hall by stowing it in the same truck with
green hides? Fruit-growers have organised, and
have two co-operative buying and selling agencies.
The Fruit-Growers’ Association has for years been
asking the Railway Commissioners to remedy their
grievances, but fruit continues to be carried and
dumped about like any other stuff on the railways.
“Perishable, eh? Well, let it perish!” And so it
continues to perish and “fall out” of the cases in
its crawl towards Darling Harbor. But in spite of
the disadvantages of our transport system, or lack of
system, a visit to the fruit section of (die Royal
Agricultural Show —or, better still, to the Goulburn
-or Bathurst Show —will prove to any unbiased
observer that we can hold our own, in quality, grad-
ing and packing, with any outside growers.
The Turning of the Tide.
Paris received the news of the Allies’ victory in
perfect calm.— Cable.
We raised no cry when the wild storm broke,
And the smoke of ruin darkened the sky.
But bowed our heads to the battle stroke
In a grim retreat as the guns came nigh.
We saw the flames that could blast and burn,
But we knew in our hearts that the tide
would turn.
We stood to our task, and the foe gave back,
Yielded a space for our hosts to breathe;
And month by month in its cauldron black
We marked how the hell-broth of war could
seethe.
Through the green death-mist and the red
death-rain
We kept the line of our faith and pain.
Scourged with the bolts of his angry pride,
Tortured and torn with his steel-barbed hate,
We faced the foe, while our bravest died.
In our patient faith we were strong to
wait—- ~ ,
Strong, while we felt in our hot hearts bum
The sure, clear hope that the tide would turn.
Oh, the months were long in the fire-swept
fieid,
And the Teuton boasting was loud and high,
The Russian hosts from his war-stroke reeled
Or s.tood in his poisoned path to die;
But we set our lips, for we surely knew
The work that at last our arms should do.
We raised no cheer when the war cloud
broke,
And we saw through the rifts our rising sun,
When the' grim foe, driven with stroke on
stroke,
Quailed at our conquering march begun—
We raised no cheer, but our hot hearts
burned,
For we knew —we hnew that the tide had
turned!

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
So eager was the cruiser Brisbane to take the
water that in her first rush froth the launching slip
she outran the limited water space and just touched
Spectacle Island.
Hammered plate and beaten keel,
Young Australia’s hope in steel!
Fast she glides from skid and prop,
Takes the wave, nor knows to stop;
Like the spirit of her land,
Restive in its rider’s hand.
Storm-ship, forged for death and pride,
Whorl' your flag sweeps down the tide
And your guns in menace show
Grey lips snarling at the foe,
Will your eager haste be such
That you dare and do too much ?
Fairer omen wh,o shall find?
Ship that took the water blind,
Young Australia’s sons are few,
Mighty work is theirs to do,
You and they together must
Hold the faith and keep the trust.
When the flaes of battle fly,
When the strong men march to die,
And the alien cannon roar
Danger at our guarded door,
Hore than lesser ships and men
You and they must compass then.
Then, grey ship, we trust in you
Smoke-enwreathed to battle through,
Scourging with your whips of flame
Foemen high in pride and name,
Eager for the hard-fought fray
As to ride the waves to-day.
Young Australia lonely stands,
Keys of doom within her hands.
Red her heart-pulse full and strong
Beats to shield her own from wrong,
And her path of destiny
Is her chaste and guarded sea.

The Wild Teutonic Struggle to Break
Through Somewhere.
h £ s merely been a question of loot with
the Bulgar, and the long sequence of Rus-
sian reverses decided which way the wild-cat
would jump. From the Hun there were pro-
mises pf Servian and Greek territory, and
trom the Turk a definite abandonment of
coveted lands. The Allies were apparently
able to offer no more than an invitation to
join m a holy cause and an assurance that
oaikan nationality would be preserved at
the termination of hostilities. Therefore the
toxy old Teuton who is King of Bulgaria,
weighing up the chances of success on either
Side, and doubtless threatened by Potsdam
with the axe unless he j’oined in the fray, has
cast his crown and sceptre into the ring. As
tlu s l nn l 8 the Greek to arms on one side'
and the Roumanian on the other, and as the
Huns are said to be ready to leap into Ser-
via and the Allies to throw troops on to the
mainland thereabouts, it looks as if the world
Win shortly be watching a furious struggle in
a ne\y place. Apart from the general enter-
tainment provided by these new develop-
ments, there is a point of particular interest
about it tor Australia, since one of the im-
mediate results may be to widen the area
over which troops from this part of the
world will find employment. Broadly speak-
mg, the latest developments are proof of
Berhn s recognition that the original plane
have broken down. German strategy aimed
first at smashing France, and, while holding
1^. the East securing foothold on the
English Channel. That failed. Then came
the necessity for holding the Western Front
while smashing Russia. That failed, too. Now
the German, with unbeaten enemies on the
two Ironts against which he has been bat-
tering for a year, and with a vast heap of
ashes and slain and debt as the visible pro-
h,S , is turning south to realise
ambitmns which have been baffled east and
west. _ Yet though there is this evidence of

day was reached in Sydney last month.
A: a meeting of operative stonemasons held
in a pub in what is now George-street West
on September 22, 1555, the system was
originated. Hugh Laundry proposed and
1 nomas Eaves seconded, “That in the
opinion of this meeting eight hours should
be the maximum of a day's labor.” Carried
unanimously. All the contractors conceded
save one, who was rebuilding
looth s Brewery after a fire. His masons
went, on strike, and won in less than a
fortnight. Prior _to that the system had
been established in Maoriland. In the early
days of Otago the artisans brought from
Scotland under engagement through Cap-
tain Cargill agreed that eight hours was a
fair thing. Cargill attempted to make it
ten. The Scots revolted, and won. Five
months after the movement was set going
in Sydney a branch of the Operative Stone
Masons Society was formed in Clark’s
Hotel, Collingwood, and so the revolution
reached Melbourne. James Galloway, after-
wards corresponding secretary to the move-
ment, was present at both meetings. There
a very fine monument over his grave in
Melbourne General Cemetery.
It is cabled that N.S.W. Agent-General
WTse has written to the London Times con-
tradicting an Australian correspondent who
declared that the State Governments were
borrowing with the same old haste for carry-
-013T7.“ publ j c works.” “Quite untrue,”
pipes Wise. Expenditure on these under-
takings has been cut down to the irreducible
minimum.” As the States added £32,000,000
tn the great national debt last year and are
yelling in chorus for more, the spectacle of
Wise risking his immortal soul in this reck-
less manner is a very painful thing.

“ROBBERY UNDER ARMS," AT
SYDNEY ADELPHI.
Gallant Captain Starlight becomes
sentimental.
The Sydney Repertory Theatre has now
its own. miniature stage, where the intimate
drama is presented to subscribers only.
Ihree one-act playlets were performed for a
three-night season last week. “The Dove
L ncaged ’ showed three nuns and a novice in
a convent; and through a sympathetic nun
the novice escapes from her “cage.” The
slight fantasy required the most delicate
treatment, and it was artistically presented
by Dorothy Dowland, Maisie Greig-Smith,
Shan Abertowe and Lily Molloy in a setting
rather remarkable considering the size of the
stage. Pearls,” by Stanley Houghton, was a
modern trifle, in which Norman Zions had
ai L ex ,?f llent part as a butler who Droves him-
self, like “The Admirable Crichton,” a man.
Frederick Ward and Monica Stewart, as a
farcical married pair, completed the best cast
u e 7 enin g- T he playlet, however,
m be ongs to tbe repertory movement.
'lhe Twelve Pound Look,” Barrie’s delight-
ru* item, has already been seen in Sydney,
and the cast was inferior to that of its last
performance. H. Leon Gapp, who took the
part of which Arthur Styan has shown the
artistic possibilities, suffered by that com-
parison ; but, despite his lack of presence, he
showed a passable conception of a difficult
study in personality. Dorothy Dowland
lacked the archness and the sympathetic
appeal of the typist. It is evident that
Irederick Ward, the Society’s director, has,
in his miniature stage, taken the first real
steps in the repertory movement. Here, at
small cost, a large number of repertory plays
can be tried out before the sort of audience
that likes that sort of play. And the public,
which so far doesn’t like that sort of play,
is saved the trouble of staying away, because
it has no chance of getting in.

“Playing the. Game,” which the Bert
Bailey co. unfurled at Melbourne King’s
last Saturday, is just the sort of “intensely
human comedy-drama” we have learned to
expect from the.. U.S.A. In its trite super-
hcial Amenpan “intensity” it breathes
bathos, and oozes insincerity from every
I,o^ , tbe (' rs t of four acts is a prologue,
sordid and simple, and five of the characters
ho figure in it are heard of no more. Dan
Mayo s wife complains that the absent Dan
is not making dollars enough to keep her in
luxury, so she bolts with a man who has
dollar notes to burn, leaving her cheeild
Nellie in charge of widow Desmond, a cir-
cumspect friend of the family. The plav
starts 15 years later, when Mrs. Mavo is
supposed to Ise dead and the man she eloped
UIS ceased to matter. This vile seducer
had. by the way, the worst cold that ever
° n A ny s , taBe ’ 80 the management
Piobably sent him home to inhale something.
Dan Mayo (Bert Bailey), who now hap-
Mavos°nf t ij e -i firSt n-V me ’ has . rise P to be the
Mayoi of Silver City, and is about to get
the nomination for the Senate. It is cost-
ing this fine, rugged, enterprising American
citizen many thousands of dollars, but he
reckons the honor will be worth the outlay
Besides, dollars come darned easy to him
By force of industry and perseverance he
lias built up a large gambling house and
liquor saloon. It is n& ordinary den of
infamy that Daniel dominates, but a place
where the game is played on the square, and
the table gets a fine, honest commission.
A pattern for publicans and sinners is good
Dan Mayo. His manager (Duggan) is the
local sheriff and former pride of the prize
ring, who also believes in playing the game.
His secretary (Guy Hastings) turns out to
be a detective, for the sole purpose of arrest-
ing a wicked politician in the last act.
There is never a mention in the whole drama
of anybody who has done, or wanted to do
any productive toil.
* * * *
All these 15 years daughter Nellie ha*
been getting expensively educated abroad
under widow Desmond’s supervision. She
thinks of her mother as an angel who
ascended to the clouds .long ago. Nellie,
accompanied by Mrs. D. and pursued by a
nice young man, comes straight to Silver
City from Paris to announce her engage-
ment, which suggests that', the dramatist was
thinking of how Mrs. G° r telyon
Ellen home to Aubrey Tariqueray when the
dear child fell in love. But Bert Bailey as
Dan Mayo is very different from Mr. Tan
queray. He is more like Dad Rudd aftei
a shave and ’aircut. Nellie, who had ex
pected to meet an elderly Apollo -in a frock
coat, recoils from papa at first. She gets
to like him, however, and her young man
doesn’t seem to mind what sort of father-in-
law the dollars are coiiiing from as long
as they get there. He belongs to a “proud
family,” but American pride is going cheap
since the war started. Well, a wicked poli-
tician picks up the non-deceased Mrs. Mayo
promiscuously, and introduces her to her
husband with blackmail intentions. Then
there are harrowing scenes all round. Dan
is broken-hearted at the thought of making
over his costly Senate nomination to the
other guy, but he must do it to prevent the
long-lost mother from being sprung on her
innocent Nellie. Also Nellie has to be told
to break off her engagement for no osten-
sible reason, whereat she protests, as Miss
Tanquera.v did of old. Sheriff Duggan
terrifies Mrs. Dan Mayo by recognising her
as the dame who broke his heart; the nice
young man recognises the wicked politician
as an embezzler; and the calamitous Mrs.
M. decides to go away without making fur-
ther trouble. The play is too theatrical and
emotional for a . co. that was organised for
“On Our Selection.” The performers as a
rule fail to naturalise the strong, false
situations, even as stage naturalisation goes.
Bailey’s picture of Dan is wanting in de-
tail, but he gets force into his delivery of
the lines. _ Miss Adeson as the widow, and
Miss Adrienne as the artless daughter, are
both on the unfeeling side at tearful
moments. Miss Keogh, as the giddy mother,
has no _ breadth of melodramatic style.
Bellairs is an abrupt, uninsinuating villain,
and Bertram is an admirable young man.

At Melbourne Royal they are squeezing the
last ounce out of “Under Cover,” previous
to producing Muriel Starr in comedy. The
name of the long-threatened comedy wherein
Muriel will be produced is “Nobody’s
Widow.” It contains a part ' for Grace
Palotta, who has been off the Melbourne
stage for quite a long time.

Melbourne’s kindly memories of “Paul
Jones” will not be disturbed by the revival
of that engaging comic opera at Her
Majesty’s last Saturday. The performance
for the most part produces an impression of
charms nicely chosen and songs well sung.
Only in the humorous department is there a
suggestion of false quantities and strange
misfits.. All the rules as to the relative sizes
of Bouillabaisse and Petit Pierre are, shat-
tered by the appearance of the brie'f Phil
Smith as Chopinette’s hubby, with the taller
and more substantial Charles Albert as his
faithful hanger-on. The result of this
arrangement is that Smith hasn’t just cause
for calling Albert “the insect,” even though
the latter tries to reduce his stature' by
assuming the crouched and twisted figure
of a bad rheumatic case. Under these cir-
cumstances Albert’s humor never has free
play, and he is condemned to look more like
a bent tree struck by lightning than an-
alert and nimble buccaneer. On the other
hand, Smith is passable enough in his
chubby, chattering way, though he would
need to be stretched on the rack or run
through a mangle to achieve the proper
inches of Bouillabaisse. The part was
written for a tall man. and the lines used to
emphasise the fact. Florence Young, as the
only Jones, is ample for all demands. Her
strong voice, refreshed by rest, is familiar
with the music. She sang her first solo ad-
mirably on Saturday, and in subsequent
numbers she was almost equally tasteful and
melodious. Miss Cadman easily suffices for
the vocal requirements of Yvonne, and her
flaxen-haired rendering of the rble is as pleas-
ing as may be. Miss Minnie Love, as Chap-
inette, is an exceptionally winsome partner
for Bouillabaisse, her one fault being a ten-
dency to take things hurriedly. She makes .

The Follies at Melbourne Tivoli are so
nearly the same as they were last week that
the difference seems hardly worth mentioning.
Australia’s enjoyable old friend, Tilda
Brune, is at Hoyt’s Theatres, Melbourne,
this week in a new film tragedy called “Iron
Justice.” Tilda is. cast as a lady who is
driven by divorce to the demi-monde, and
she represents the feelings of the damaged
heroine with all her old tendency to pant in
her happiness and heave in her despair.
Next Saturday Hoyt’s star the dainty Mary
Pickford in a motion-picture version of
“Sweet Nell of Old Drury.”

Frederic Shipman is reviving the pictur-
esque story of Damon and Pythias in a new
six-reel motion play at Melbourne Audi-

striking mutual affection of the long-dead
Damon and his pal should buy seats at the
Audi., where the full record of the partner-
ship is given with a wealth of weapons, bare
legs and imaginative detail not mentioned
by Cicero and other Dago reporters of the
time. Technically, the picture is a very fine
specimen.

At Melbourne Bijou Barry Lupiuo is now
repeating himself successfully in several
wheezes that he originally introduced in J.
C. Williamson pantomime. His engagement,
it «eems, is only brief, as he is booked to
depart for Amurka on October 26. Other
new features at the Bijou are the comedy
jumping act of F. Sidney and co., the small-
boy impersonations of Effie Fellows, and the
musical business of the Goolman pair. The
Goolmans make noises in divers novel ways,
even employing a set of musical alarm clocks
in a sort of ragtime duet.

Adelaide picture-shows are steadily “star-
ring” certain players. Patrons get to know
them well, managers say, and will neglect
a good thing by unknown players for any-
thing that includes Mary Pickford or Mar-
guerite Clark, Chaplin or Costello. Mary
Pickford is now getting close on to Nellie
Stewart’s ground in a “Mistress Nell”
romance. At the Tivoli, Elwyn Harvey is
an effective Glory in a “Christian” adapta-
tion, which has the pluck to drop
on a happy ending, just after the “Kiss me,
John!” episode. Roland Conway is a manly
John Storm, but the author makes him say
“O Lord” right through the big scene with
a monotony that comes perilously near the
undignified. At the King’s Victor Prince
puts up another hour of “revusical comedy,”
much assisted by a handsome batch of bare-
kneed girls, and De Fra maintains a fair
claim to his title of Fearless Wonder. Con-
certs are everywhere; easily the most gener-
ally popular was that which filled the Exhi-
bition, the annual corroboree of all the
State schools. Fine singing and marching
and some fair acting and dancing were
shown by a thousand or so performers.

“Fax”: Thanks to his family connections,
the late J. A. Wilson got some quite flatter-
ing obituary notices in the Melbourne press,
though he was one of the most disrespected
old citizens in the local liquor trade and
theatrical business. As licensee for many
years of the notorious Palace Hotel and
owner of the adjoining Bijou and Gaiety
Theatres he fairly earned a reputation
which nobody would care to find noted bn
his own tombstone. Numerous lessees of the
Bijou, from Brough and Boucicault down-
wards, have freely testified of his demerits,
for his gratuitously offensive manner in
business and constitutional reluctance to
part up made him more than merely dis-
liked. Obituai'y notices stated that he was
born at Ndsvcastle-on-Tyne, and came to
Australia in ,1852, attracted by the Ballarat
gold rush. He was probably not born Wil-
son—long ago the present historian Wfjs
told that that name had been adopted ill
this country. There should be a few old
readers of The Bulletin whose memories
of early mining days at Ballarat include
some interesting recollections of the man.
Lincoln Eftumer, whafis cast for any boss
policeman parts in the J.C.W. American
repertoire, is not going into vaudeville this
Australian trip at any rate. The big
American leaves for California late in
October, though Australia will surely see
him again.
The entertaining “Royal Strollers” were
initiated 17 years ago by Sydney James.
Of the present lot in Australia, G. W. Des-
mond and the capable Madeline Rossiter are
the old inhabitants. Desmond has been with
James 14 years, and Miss Rossiter 11 years.
She was 16 when she joined, so another
secret is out.
A feature of this season’s tour of Wirth
Bros.’ circus will be Miss May Wirth, who,
a couple of years ago* was acclaimed by
U.S.A. critics to be the finest circus horse-
woman in * their country—which of course
means the world. Accompanied by a party
of new performers for the big show (which
will open at Melbourne on October 16), she
arrived from sland a few days ago.
One of the silent tailors who figure in the
far background of the first scene in “Potash
and Perlmutter” is the veteran Newton
Griffiths, a robustious actor of old. One
remembers the demonstrative Griffiths as an
unholy Roman in the. first production of
“Sign of the Cross.” He was the battered
warrior who used to tell the fair Berenice
that his only idea of love-making was to
“carve his way to a woman’s heart.” Where-
upon Berenice, pretending to shudder, would
look at Griffiths and say, “Terrible Metel-
lus!” which he certainlv was. When the
old man was 30 or 40 years younger he
played leading parts in Sydney, and when
Deeming was figuring in the Chamber of
Horrors at Melbourne Waxworks the voci-
ferous Griffiths was specially engaged to tell
the story of his crimes.
“L.H.P.”: Dick Whittington and his puss,
who will frolic in panto at the Sydney
Adelphi this Christmas, have been 12 years
a-slumbering. The last version of the old
yarn was pantomimed at the Royal in the
Easter of 1903, under Williamson and Mus-
grove’s auspices, with Rose Hamilton as
Dick, Little Gulliver as the Cat, Barney
Fagin (who “produced”) as Fitzwarren,
Henrietta Byron as Alice, Frank Crossley as
Idle Jack, and Edward Lewis as the Dame.
Tilly Woodlock was principal dancer and
Minnie Everett invented a ballet, “The Evo-
lution of the Fan,” that for beauty and
originality has not been beaten for a long
time. Leon Caron dished up a lot of good
music for that show. Melbourne Royal had
a version of the Cat by Edmund FinD for
the holiday season of 1897-98, with Maggie
Moore as Dick, Laura Roberts, Harry
Roberts, Edwin Kelly and Gus Gregory.
Walter Roynham and Harry Roberts “pro-
duced,” and retained the transformation
scene and harlequinade, with Daisy Coppin
as Columbine. It had a great run and brought
many shekels to Bilanderson and Charlie
Holloway. But best of all ’prentices was
“Dick,” the two-act opera by Jakobowski,
the composer of “Erminie,” which the Brough-
Boucicault opera-burlesque troupe did in
the late ’Bo’s. Bob Brough was the Aider-
man. With Willie Warde and Charlie Brown
he did a Dervish dance that was the talk
of the day. The B.’s toured Maoriland with
this piece, plus “The Forty Thieves” and
“Little Jack Sheppard,” in the winter of
1888, and this was the first appearance of
Brough in those latitudes. Later in 1893-4
partner Boucicault and Mrs. Brough went to
Maoriland as members of the comedy com-
pany. Titheradge was a member of that
troupe. It was his second visit, the first
having been in 188 G-7, as a pillar of the
Triumvirate’s “Magistrate” comedy combina-
tion.
“You occasionally find a good actor even
among supers,” says a Melbourne paper.
Tush! What of it? You occasionally find
a good super even among actors, for the
matter of that.
“0.K.”: “Jimmy” Fernandez, the old-
fashioned actor who died the other month,
aged 80, was no more English than he
looked, though he had earned his living on
the English stage for 60 years. Probably
his paternal name ended in vitch. Anyhow
he was born in Russia, and his nose sug-
gested Israel. Fernandez in his younger
days was usually a romantic melodramatic
mummer of the most picturesque order, but
his barnstormy training didn’t narrow his
range as a character actor in his middle
age. He played all sorts of Dickens charac-
ters in a forcible way; Micawber, Newman
Noggs, Mr. darker and Ralph Nickleby
were within his range in spite of his marked
personality and a slight cast in his eye. He
was only in his early 40’s when Irving gave
him special engagements, and from then
until he was a very old man he held his own
among the new schoolists in modern plays.
Born 50 years later he might have earned
a big salary as a “picture” actor, for he was
a master of silent effects and a mummer of
natural importance, like his famous con-
temporary Henry Irving. Irving also was
born too soon, or cinematography was born
too late. On the films he would have been
an unrivalled artist.
“Copy Boy”: The flowers of speech that
bloom in the spring are being carefully cul-
tivated by some of the pillars of Melbourne’s
municipal life. Following the recent remark
of a Melbourne councillor that he was “in
the position of Lord Macaulay—waiting for
something to turn up,” comes the observa-
tion of another Bumble to the effect that
the Market Gardens Committee, or some
such body, should be “like Potiphar’s wife —
above suspicion.”
“Quill,” after attending the meeting:—
He was plump, well dressed and superbly confi-
dent. And he also appeared to be a Good Austra-
lian-democratic to the backbone, a passionate
admirer of the national institutions and the friend
of freedom.
“Make no mistake about it, gentlemen,” he said.
“This is a fight for everything the people of the
British race prize most dearly. The struggle is for
the heritage handed to us by our fathers, for the
priceless boon of self-government, for protection
against a brutal autocracy, for the virtue and happi-
ness of our wives and children. The duty of every
man is unmistakable—in this hour of great trial
and imminent peril he must do everything he can
to uphold the honor of his country and throw back
the barbarous enemy who challenged our right to
live in peace. (Applause.) There must be no
shrinking from our supreme duty to strike a blow
against enslavement—(cheers)—to stand shoulder to
shoulder against the foe, throwing every ounce of
energy, all our resources and all our belongings into
the mighty struggle. I want to urge all you young
men to enlist without delay in order that the battle
may be decided in our favor. Decisive victory is
what we must look for, and we will achieve i), too ?
if we put forth all our strength in men and money,
realising that no sacrifice can be too great. (Loud
applause.) My only regret is that I cannot go to
the Front myself.” (Frantic cheers.)
It was a tremendous success that meeting, and
the speaker was earnestly congratulated on the fine
ring of his address. Then he hurried away and made
out a claim on the Treasury, to wit—Lunch Is. 6d.,
ferry fare Id.; total Is. 7d. And a clerk wearily
cheeked the voucher, and marked it off to be
charged to loan account.

ART SHOWS IN SYDNEY.
Besides the Will Dyson exhibition in the
Hordern Gallery, two art shows bloomed in
Sydney last week, and neither is calculated
to divert much attention from the racing
carnival. One is housed at Grace Bros.’,
and is composed of the work pf people
belonging to the Society of Artists, _ the
Royal Art Society and Women Painters.
In that it is a “combined” show it js notable,
for it is many years since these societies
would hang anything in one another’s back-
yard unless it was the other fellow’s
effigy. Mrs. Paul has the credit for the truce.
Most of the paintings and drawings are
old friends and have been blessed or un-
blessed previously. Julian Ashton, Howard
Ashton, the Lindsays, Norman Carter,
Isobel McWhannell, James R. Jackson,
Dattilo-Rubbo, Florence Rodway, Watkins
and about 30 others have contributed largely
from stock. A deal of the canvas will go
back to stock unregretted ; still it is a treat
to see again “The Awakening,” by Julian
Ashton; to feel the refreshing coolness from
the deep, dark pool in liis “Everlasting
Hills” ; to hear James R. Jackson’s “White
Ships” lazily rubbing together at their
romantic blue-water berth; to walk by
Gruner’s “Low Tide,” and along the hidden
beach that Mrs. Parsons discovered
by the bush fringe ; to feel for a match to
hand to Itubbo’s fine old man with the p*pe
and tobacco plug; to run through the glade
with Lionel Lindsay’s impetuous young man
in pursuit of Eve’s daughter —a bold hand-
ful who has mislaid her fig leaf; and so on
through a couple of hundred.
The other show is the Spring Exhibition
of the Royal Art Society, which served to
open a handsome and much-needed gallery
in Sydney, in the new dwelling of the
Public Instruction Department.
Like last year’s show, this year’s is a
disappointment, although the Society’s well-
wishers had hoped that the past; 12 months,
so pregnant with the inspiration which in
other times local artists have said they lacked,
would have brought forth stronger and bolder
work. A war that trembles a world! Bea t
of- drum and rustle of colors; shot, shell and
trench ; the tramp of feet over broken hearts ;
death and the glory of its cruelty ; torn ranks
—endless inspiration that blazes by day and
throbs by night. But how little did it affect
the R.A. plodders! Only one or two painters
were fired at all. Dattilo-Rubbo touches a
chord with “Where Daddy Fell”—an interior
wherein a bent grandfather points out the
death spot on the map to the little son, while
the young mother melts in grief beside them.
Charles Tindall strikes another chord with
a picture of the roaring fight between the
Sydney and the Emden. The trustees of the
Gallery purchased this; but thq painting of
that great sea story has yet to be done.
There are one or two others that, stand apart
from the ruck of the Usual Thing—ll.M.S.
Lion in action and the sinking of the Lusi-
tania (Charles Bryant), and “Back from
Gallipoli” (Norman Carter) —the last a
spirited painting of a typical young Aus-
tralian soldier.
The most attractive work in the show is
James R. Jackson’s, and of. his contributions
“A Morning in the Studio,” in oils, is
passed the congratulatory hand. It is most
delicately and effectively done. The same
artist’s “Timber Schooner,” another good
sample of his versatile and facile brush, was
bought for the Gallery. Lister Lister’s
familiar work is centred in a .big landscape
representing country in the Jamieson Valley,
Blue Mountains. It is characteristically
capable. Norman Carter is best represented
by a portrait of Richard Teece, painted at
the order of the A.M.P. directors; James A.
Crisp shows one or two good water-colors ;
J. S. Watkins loses by his portrait of A. C.
Carmichael; and other well-known artists on
the walls by proxy are A. J. Daplyn, G. V.
F. Mann, G. L. Trindall (he sold a pencil
study to the trustees). Will Ashton (sold
them an oil), W. M. Whitney, Henry Crisp,
Evelyn Chapman, Alfred Coffey, Penleigh
Boyd, D. G. Reid, Salvana and C. N.
Worsley.
John Madden, C.J., is still full of hope
and froth and the spirit of prophecy. At a
demonstration of the Australian Patriots’
League, when badges were given to a few
men who had been rejected for service
abroad, the C.J. made public his belief that
“victory is not very far ahead.” The C.J.
means to be patriotic, no doubt, and the
A.P.L. may be all that its name indicates,
yet while Madden in his folly discourages
recruiting without meaning to, and the
A.P.L. gives badges to men who are not" fit
instead of encouraging them to get fit-if
they, can, somewhere at every Front men
are'being killed because there are not enough
supports; and somewhere behind every
firing-line men are dying because medical
supplies are short. This A.P.L., by the way,
is closely associated with the Overseas
Club, and it is worth noting the fact that
one of the Club’s leading members lately
described as “disgraceful” the refusal of
War Minister Pearce to spend a thousand
or two on rejects’ badges.

Doutless you have already tried pepsin,
bismuth, soda, charcoal, drugs, etc., and so
you know that these things will not cure your
trouble—in some cases they do no even give
relief —but before giving up hope and decid-
ing that you are a chronic dyspeptic just try
the effect of a little magnesia— not the ordi-
nary carbonate, oxides or cjtyates, but pure
bisurated magnesia, which you can obtain
from practically any chemist in either powder
or tablet form. Take .half-a-teaspoonful of
the powder or two compressed tablets with a
little water after your next meal, and see
what a difference this makes. It will in-
santly neutralise the harmful acid which now
causes your food to ferment, giving rise to
wind, heartburn, flatulence and many other
unpleasant symptoms, and you will find that,
provided you take' a little bisurated magnesia
immediately afterward, you 'can eat almost
anything and enjoy it without any danger
of pain and discomfort to follow.*

In Melbourne now you never hear of a

tt *\ om an Australian long resident in the
U.S.A., and still there: —
Douglas Mawson’s statement, made after a rush
through the States, that 100 per cent, of the nav.v
and 100 per cent, of the army and 90 per cent, of
the people are pro-British, is dangerous and mis-
leading nonsense. If the percentages were anything
like that, the President wouldn’t have had to write so
many Notes. No doubt Mawson thought he was
speaking' well of us; but it is simply because Aus-
tralia has been stuffed with such rubbish that she
has had less patience with the President than lie
deserves.
I believe that every city and town here
has its German shooting club. Nobody paid
much attention to such things until recently
mei ely thought they were the harmless
diversion of mild-mannered and inoffensive natural-
ised citizens. As the inoffensive citizens were care-
ful not to miss an opportunity of decorating their
flagpoles with the Stars and Stripes there was no
suspicion. Now there is an uncomfortable feeling
among the non-German people that if there should be
real trouble Germany could instantly mobilise a
bigger army within this country—well drilled and
equipped, and on whose fanatical patriotism it could
rely than the U.S. could raise in months.
As for munitions, the large purchases the Germans
have made in this country have yet to be explained.
What,are they doing with them? They are not ship-
ping them to Germany. And they are not a bit of
good for making sauerkraut or frankfurters. The
Piesident knows this, which may account for his not
wishing to come to a rupture with Berlin.
Yet by far the greater part of intelligent and in-
dependent American opinion is heart and soul for the
Allies. That the Republic has not done as much for
them as might have been expected is due to the
fact that the nation is as yet a conflicting conglomer-
ation of racial hatreds and prejudices which have
hitherto merely slumbered through lack of an ex-
citing cause.
Boiled down, the U.S.A. are a democracy
dominated for the present by a small
minority which has devoted itself to military
training, while the majority has devoted
itself to the capture of the dollar and the
making of a great noise at ’ball matches.
The good old law of supply and demand
seems to have been captured by the Turks.
A record harvest of summer
fruit is anticipated in N. S.
Wales this year; but the people
whose business it is to come
between the producer and the
consumer do not anticipate a
glut. What they say is: “The
market conditions are not likely
to be worse with a record crop
of fruit than during a season of
ordinary supply.” Certainly
not! There will be the same old
poor prices to the producer, and
the same old famine prices to
the consumer. A Sydney fruit-
seller recently gave particulars
of what the citizen pays for
when he buys a shilling’s worth
of fruit —3d. for rent, 2d. for
losses (mainly caused by high
prices restricting the sale) and
sd. for fruit agents’ charges,
cartage, lighting, profit, etc.
So that when the. democracy
invests in a bob’s worth of apples it pays
tuppence for the stuff it wants to eat and
tenpence for other things that it merely
wants to curse.

The Marrickville (Sydney) man whose pet
escaped and scared a woman to. death has
learnt that keeping a chimpanzee may be a
costly hobby. The chase after the hairy
animal, up to the tragic incident-.■ was a
humorous item in the programme of a drab
suburb.. It is not every day that a man with
something resembling a poker, accompanied
by a woman with a kettle of hot water and
hostile intentions, can be seen chasing a
large-sized monkey; and Marrickville enjoyed
the entertainment. At last, however, the
animal was brought to a condition of fury by
much pursuit, and after a scramble to get
away from it a woman was picked up dying.
Her husband sued, and the defence that the
lady was stout and possessed a weak heart
was of no avail. The jury assessed the
damages at £450, and all the suburban chim-
panzee-owners round Sydney are considering
the situation.
THAT PROSPEROUS LOOK.
HUSBAND : " The doctor says I must have an operation .”
MIFE: "Didn’t I tell you not to wear your Sunday suit?"
De Yid”: Selwyn Evans, of the big
Mow Memorial Church of Adelaide, has
startled the village like a burglar-alarm. At
latest reports the. Torrens was said to be in
flames. Being something of a thinker as
well as a parson, Evans has been viewing
the disproportion of the sexes that the Great
Murder is going to cause with something
akin to horror. Society, he points out, is
just what we make it, and there is nothing
divine about its laws. Woman, as he under-
stands her, is essentially planned and built
tor motherhood. Yet the chances are that
many thousands of her will never have the
opportunity of marriage. Why, then, should
all the prospective babies whom we shall
need so badly be lost to the State, and the
mothers be doomed to a life of single cussed-
ness? “If marriage is impossible to thou-
sands of young women,” he says, “one of
two conclusions is inevitable—there must be
something wrong with modern society, or
there, must be some change in the form of
marriage.” In 50 years, he predicts,
motherhood will have a meaning.
Womanhood will be differently understood.
Every woman will have the opportunity if
she chooses, to live a full life as God'has
intended that she should.” It all sounds
very dreadful, doesn’t it ; but I do wish, the
reverend • rebel had • been less sloppy!
Apparently, not caring to be any less sloppy
himself, he has invited woman- to speak for
herself from his pulpit, and Adelaide is
breathlessly waiting to see the Amazon who
takes up the challenge and puts things"'from
the other sex’s point of view. The chief
difference between the two seems to be that
a woman’s instincts are almost invariably
polyandrous before she marries, whereas a
man’s become polygamous afterwards,
* . * * #
The most staggeringly unlikely crime for
aii Australian to be found guilty of these
times is pretending falsely to be. a German.
Yet it is for just this that a man has been
given three months in Adelaide. He was
interned on Torrens Island a year ago as
“German reservist and prisoner of war,”
and of course got food and clothing; but
lately he admitted that he gave - himself up
because he was destitute and nobody would
give work to a man with his accent. -On
the trial for false pretences he necessarily
had to make the defence that he is a Ger-
man. As he put it, he was born in Queens-
land about 1887, but was taken by his Ger-
man father to Germany in 1895 and stayed
there till 1912, serving a term in the army,
so that now he is all mixed and declines to
fight on either side. But the Court gave him
three months for not being German; after
which people will no doubt refuse him work
because lie is.
“F.H.”: The Browns' newly-imported
domestic-help came home late at night with
two bottles in a string-bag, after having
gone up the street a few hours previously
for a. postage-stamp. Mrs. Brown said
nothing that evening, and Agatha offered no
remarks. In fact, she was speechless. Next
morning Brown gave Agatha a week’s wages
and a polite good-morning. Agatha took
her wardrobe out of the second-best bedroom
and proceeded to pack up on the steps of
the back verandah, using a foot-square piece
or . paper as a portmanteau. All day she
toiled there, attempting impossible things
with the most intimate articles of spring
wear. The baker came and went. So did
the butcher and grocer. But Agatha pro-

ceeded with her packing and gave no sig o.
At last, when the sun was about to set and
Agatha had drunk all the beer, she remem-
bered that there was another sheet of.news-
paper in the pantry, completed her prepara-
tions therewith, and at last departed for the
railway-station, telling the doorstep what she
thought of it. That was the day when the
.Browns decided to spring eighteenpence a
week and get an Australian girl.
HER ANSWER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Beside, the muddy river’s brim in unmown grass they
. sat,
She in..her skirt of crepe de Chine, he in his dove-
grey hat,
And languidly he wiped the dust from off his dove-
grey spat.
The day was made for loving mood, for lots of sloppy
kisses,
For asking any pretty girl to come and be a missus.
He owed his tailor ten pound odd. (Irrelevancy this
is.)
He giggled like a clown in love, and wooed with
tender glances,
While blithering of picture shows, and ferry rides,
and dances ;
But. ■ she was very, very wise, and wasn’t taking-
chances.
Her eyes were hidden from his gaze by one big flop
of hat,
He cursed the balmy purple hills that she was look-
ing at,
And on his trousers fiercely crushed a too-persistent
gnat.
But still he talked, and looked at her, beneath her
big sun hat,
Then bolder grew, and clasped her hand; but little
things like that
Could not divert her anxious gaze across the lime-
stone flat.
So when he said: “Well, what d’you say? I’ve got
enough to feed you.”
She murmured ’neath the big sun hat: “ ’Twould be
a shame to bleed you.”
Then raised her eyes, and, sighing, said: “Your King
and Country need you.”

Men’s
Outfitters,
This paper can’t decide whether to ad-
mire more the suddenness of Charles
Ackeroyd, of Victoria, or the tender regard
for “public morality” evinced by the Law in
that State. Mr. Ackeroyd last week asked
Justice Hood for a divorce from his wife,
Eunice May, on the ground of desertion.
His narrative was that he had married the
lady in Anril, 190 G, after an acquaintance
of three days, and that she left him finally
in February, 1907, and was now and had
for some time been living with another man.
This looked smooth; but next it appeared
that Charles A., being of opinion that three
years’ absence on the part of his wife
entitled him to marry again, had espoused
one. Blanche Mary in April, 1910. He was
not so sudden this time, having known the
lady three weeks. But his honeymoon was
even briefer, as the bride disappeared three
days later, and he was told she had died m
the Melbourne Hospital. In January of the
next year he once more became a happy
man, the bride , this time being Dora Kezia.
One minor consequence of these exploits
was that in 1912 the Law handed him 24
months’ “hard” on two charges of bigamy,
all three ladies being sufficiently alive to
give evidence. Apparently he desired fur-
ther adventures in matrimony, as he asked
his Honor to release him from his original
contract with Eunice May, the lady who
was now housekeeping elsewhere. His
Honor viewed Mr. Ackeroyd curiously, not
to say disamirovinglv, and then remarked
HE MISSED HIS CHANCE.
WIFE (angrily): “Heaps of cleverer men
than you have proposed to me!”
HUSBAND: “Quite so. They wisely accepted
a refusal. I was the fool who proposed
twice.”
that “public morality” had to be considered,
and the petition would be dismissed. So
the position is that Ackeroyd may not marry
either No. 2 or No. 3, or even No. 14; also
Eunice May, the lady who is alleged to be
housekeeping, may not marry the gentleman
she is housekeeping for, should she feel in-
clined. On the other hand, public morality is
satisfied, and its delicate garments are still
unsullied. It is a strange beast, this Public
Morality. Some people might even suspect
that it is a snuffling hypocrite.
“Protein”: We’re a dismal crowd in Mel-
bourne these nights. The Law, suspecting
that it isn’t always the stout, has turned
sourly on the lobster, and now forbids us
our supper. The edict has gone forth that
all cooked-meat shops must close at 8. p.m.
Therefore the festive frankfurt passes with
the demure crayfish and the beer-jug back
to the dear, dead days of Old Romance. The
SPORT FOR SPORT’S SAKE.
“Hello! What ye fishin' there for, eh?”
“Sniffs.”
“ Snips? What’s sniffs?”
“How d' I know? I ain’t never caught none
yet!”
Act is a good one for shopkeepers in distant
suburbs who glean their profits from a purely
family trade, but for men nearer the city
who depend on a catch-trade from theatre-
goers and night-workers, it is hard mozzle.
Unless you keep a relentless eye on the
clock you can quite easily starve in Mel-
bourne, which holds the distinction of being
a city where you cannot buy bread after
0 p.m. These Acts and regulations applying
to ready-for-sale foods fall heavily on a
community to which life is already haicl
enough—that brave old army of roomers
iu the city and poorer suburbs, who go out
to work through the day and return at night
to eat and sleep in hired cubicles.

The man who manufactures the German
official communiques ‘-is getting clumsy.
After an action, no hiatter how badly you
have been licked, it is always possible to
claim a win—like the Austrian general who
was retreating victoriously and inflicting
terrible losses on his pursuers. But the
German, who prepares the story of his wins
in advance, is stupidly giving them to the
papers before the rows take place, and that
spoils the whole effect. Week before last
Berlin authoritatively announced that a
strong force of Russians had been “driven
back in disorder” 12 hours before the force
came on. And when it did come on it
wasn’t driven back. A few days later
General French communiqued: “The report
in Friday’s German communique that we
attempted to attack on Thursday south of
La Bassee Canal and failed is untrue. No
attack was attempted.” That time the Ger-
man had repulsed an attack that wasn t
hatched till three days later. And every-
body knows what happened when it was
hatched. Henceforward whenever the Ber-
lin factory states that the Germans have
just given the enemy beans, it w T ill be safe
to bet that they are going to get the vege-
table within the next day or two. And,
meantime, they are the little boy who
whistles to show that he’s not afraid of the
hiding he’s just waiting from father.
One Australian bank reckons that out of
1800 men on its staff 300 have gone to the
Front; and other banks can make boasts
almost as good. This accounts for the Turks,
when they rushed the Australian lines, find-
ing so many men ready to give them the
right change.
“Dux”: They’re getting to know us!
Printed large in a Cairo bar is the legend:
Australian Spoken Here.

“Aloysius”: “What’s the latest Furphy?”
somebody’s bound to ask when a new fellow
drops into the trench. Every Kangaroo
knows now what a Furphy is. In other
countries it goes by the name or Rumor.
At the Broadmeadows
camp all the waste
from the lines was
tipped into bins at
the back of the cook
lines, whence it was
taken away in carts
built for the purpose
and bearing the manu-
facturer’s name, “Fur-
phy,” in large letters
on' their sides. This
space by the cook lines
was the regular meet-
ing place of fatigue
parties, and nearly all
the camp rumors had
their origin in these
groups near the rub-
bish carts, so “Garn,
that’s one of Fur-
phy’s,” was quite apt.
There is another word
having its origin at
about the same time
and under similar cir-
cumstances, but what
it makes up in ex-
pressiveness it loses in
drawing-room flavor,
and maybe for that
reason is not in such
use as “Furphy.”
These Furphies, by the
way, are brothers, I
suppose, of The Bul-
letin’s old “Tom Col-
lins,” who wrote “Such is Life.” Anyway,
he was a Furphy, and one of a family of
cart-builders.

“Herero”: From West Africa, where he
has put in JO months trekking after Ger-
mans by night, and putting them out of
business at short range in the grey dawn,
comes Private Rex B. Stocks, of Ballarat,
with one of the most cold-blooded atrocity
stories yet written on the Huns’ charge-
sheet. Stocks, who seems to shoot the
straighter for being a Christian Scientist,
is a keen-eyed Australian with a jaw like a
cow-catcher, who gave up a job in the
Johannesburg Municipal Council to join
the Natal Light Horse. After tasting German
methods in the form of water from poisoned
wells, Stocks was prepared for surprises, but
he says he got more than he was ready for.
Lieutenant Du Meillon, one of the scoWs,
backed by five blackbo.vs, had put up a fight
to a finish against 70 Germans. They
buried him where he fell, but, in the hope
of making his grave a death-trap, they placed"
concealed contact-mines round it. When
his wife visited the place, one of the mines
exploded under the foot of an escort. That
no one was hurt was not the fault of Fritz
the Frightful. Such brutes would not merely
poison a well. They would poison a loving-
cup.

“Carfax” : That excited cable message from
London stating that Winston Churchill had
been seized in the street with a sudden im-
pulse to pursue art, and, rushing into a shop,
had bought some brushes and paint with
which, after a day or two’s musing, he
had turned out a striking picture, gives the
straight tip to the publicity agents of Aus-
tralian politicians. We will *be stumbling
over this sort of thing in a day or two: —
Mr. Andrew Fisher has developed an extraor-
dinary talent for verse writing. While proceeding
to Canberra he noticed an empty waterhole, and,
purchasing a rhyming dictionary and a manual -on
“How to write poetry,” spent several hours in close
study of their contents. Subsequently Mr. Fisher
read to the Caucus “An Ode to a Billabong,” “A
Sick Politician’s Farewell,” “My Railway, 0 My
Railway,” and other compositions. Caucus agreed
(Frank Anstey and Hughes dissenting) that the
verses showed high lyrical quality,'and expressed the
opinion that Mr. Fisher should at a date subsequent
to the Referenda publish—anonymously —a selection
of his works.
An astonishing instance of Mr. Holman’s versa-
tility is afforded by a group of allegorical figures in
marble, which are to be put on view when a site
has been decided upon by a Commission to be ap-
pointed for the purpose. It appears that Mr. Hol-
man has always had a yearning for Art, and, hear-
ing that a block of stone was for sale, had it pur-
chased by an agent, on commission, and removed
to a vacant room in the Treasury. There in the
intervals of his daily labors Mr. Holman has fash-
ioned what is stated by his colleagues to be a very
striking piece of work, rivalling the finest efforts of
Michael Angelo. It represents “The Triumph of
Labor.” A figure of heroic size stands poised on a
platform holding aloft a gigantic weight. The
agonised look on the face of the Colossus and the
line of straining muscles across the abdomen and
finely-moulded torso, show that the triumph has
called for prodigious effort. Prone at the feet of
the central figure are several smaller ones in atti-
tudes of exhaustion, having evidently tried to-Mt
the weight but collapsed under the strain.
Messrs. Pearce and Jensen started to learn the
violin last week, and will to-morrow evening play
selections at the Town Ilall from Beethoven and
Sarasate in aid of the fund for indigent contractors
to the Defence Department. They have made amaz-
ing progress in their studies under Parliament
House, and yesterday evening had actually mastered
the whole technique of the instrument.
Of course, George Black and Carmichael
(N.S.W.) will be singing duets within a
week ; and if Ryan is not making all Banana'
land ring with admiration of his witchery,
in private, as a gifted artist on the mouth-
organ, then write me down a Bulgar.

On a recent Friday a big transport left
Brisbane carrying Light Horse for Egypt.
The joy of the troopers —who had had four
solid months of the Chermside dust, drouth,
drill and discipline—was great ; and tlieir
departure to assist in making history was a
jovial function. But, on arriving at Pin-
kenba, it was found that there was a doubt
about the steamer getting away—the coolie
firemen had gone on strike, refusing to do
work at the wharf. As soon as the L.H.
fellows got the strength of things there'
was one shout of rage and one quick rush
forward, bayonets in hand. The misguided
heathens were congregated forward, one
half in the bow of the boat, the other hall:
at the top of the stoke-hold hatchway, and
all hands were wearing nods and becks and
wreathed, smiles which outshone those of
Chunder Loo. When they saw what was
coming, the smiles just peeled ofF and the
crowd nearest the stokeholds jumped Jim
Crow for the infernal regions, pursued by
irate Queenslanders about 6ft. 4iu. high, and
they fell to work as if Siva, the Destroyer,
was in charge. The crowd on the fo’c’s’le-
head were not so fortunate, and in their
direction there was a rehearsal of an Aus-
tralian bayonet-charge which would have
made the fortune of a moving picture. The
noise of it sounded just as though Achi Baba
had fallen clean through Gallipoli. Mean-
time, other colored minions, almost grey
with fright, went rushing about yelling
“Not me, sahib ! Not me! Me saloon-boy
—me no fireman —me saloon boy !” The
Light Horse then consolidated its position
and all hands spliced the main brace; the
anchor was weighed, and the strike was
officially declared “off,” while the fourth
engineer made a huge requisition for stick-
ing-plaster.
A DIFFERENCE.
HE: “I don't consider marriage a lottery.
Do you ?”
SHE: “No. If a man draws a blank in a
lottery he can tear it up and take
another chance .”
11l the camp at Albert Fark (Melb.) a
very raw recruit had given a lot of trouble.
He persisted in stupidly muddling things
right and left, and when the officer on
the job had expended language enough to
drive a bullock-team from Carpentaria to
Footscray he remained very much as he
was. A fresh blunder induced a final out-
burst. Billjim was stung to the quick. He
stepped out of the ranks. “If I well
don’t suit you,” he said, “you well
know what to do—l’ll take your week s
notice!”

What could we do for England dear?
How help to strike the hated foe?
I couldn’t take a gun; ’twas clear
That William Henry could not go.
But we were patriots, just the same;
With courage we were all aflame.
What could we do to show the fine
Emotions we were cherishing,
Our loathing for these German swine,
Our splendid faith in Britain's King?
How make our great devotion plain
At little cost, with not much strain ?
Now when the family walks abroad
We never fail to make a hit;
It’s patent to the vulgar horde
That we have done our little bit.
Our baby boy looks just too cute
Dressed in his khaki soldier suit.

A millionaire might turn up liis nose at the
possibility of earning 10s. in five minutes;
but the average citizen is not likely to tip
his nasal appendage heavenwards at: such a
prospect. That is one reason why Ilean’s
Essence, the great money-saving remedy for
coughs, colds, catarrh, etc., has jumped into
such popular favor. The other reason is
that this preparation gives colds, influenza,
etc., the knock-out blow in a comparatively
few rounds or doses. Hean’s Essence
(which is obtainable from chemists and
stores everywhere), added to water and
sweetening, at once produces a pint of the
champion, ready-to-use mixture. A pint of
ordinary remedies costs only 2s. That is
how it enables users to save 10s. in a few
minutes.*

Dying at the age of 84, E. H. Cameron.
‘Father” of Vic. Assembly, did not long
enjoy the ease that should have come with
his retirement from politics this year. En-
tering Parliament in 1874, he saw 23 Min-
istries in office. Yet he was a believer in
Party Government to the last. It is note-
worthy that he didn’t run his private busi-
ness on the party system. He was a coun-
try storekeeper (he had previously been a
butcher) when he had a row with a
goldfields warden, and that brought him
under James McCulloch’s notice. McCulloch
encouraged him to try politics, and that is
how he got into Parliament as member for
his district (Evelyn) away back in 1874.
“S.S.” : Keir Hardie may have been a
stickler for the rag cap and externals of the
‘ Red Rag” cult, but he was something of a
fine, old, fruity Tory inside. During his
stay in Melbourne he haunted the best rest-
aurants. and tempered a good Conservative
meal with fervent discourse on the iniquity
of tipping. “Tip-taking breeds servility,”
he said over the roast on one occasion. “A
man can’t take tips without cultivating cer
tain wormy attributes. I would rather kick
a man than tip him. At least that leaves
him the option of kicking back.” A few
minutes later a florid stockbroker came
pawing for liis coat hung against the wall
behind Hardie’s chair, while maintaining
conversation with his lady friend. Cour-
teously Hardie handed the coat; he even
helped it on. Then he turned to us in
blank dismay, holding out a sixpence in his
palm. “My God,” he said, “the scoundrel’s
tipped me!”
The tallest Expeditionary yet recruited in
Australia (there is Oft. 61in. of him) was
piloted into The Bulletin oflice in Sydney
the other day. He has already gone through
two campaigns (Boxer Rebellion and Boer
War) ; but they were open, walkabout
affairs in which a man could stand up
straight and stretch himself. In this miser-
able liole-and-corner business the soldier has
to be continually bobbing down and perform-
ing rabbit-dives into dug-outs—and the
extra-big fellow is hard at work learning
how to fold himself up accordingly. But
what a man for a cross-country bayonet
chase!
From “Rosna” in London :
Recently wounded in France, Guy Wylly, one of
tli' l first Australian V.C.’s of the Boer scrimmage. He
is a Tasmanian, but spent most of his boyhood in
South Aus., where he was at school at St. Peter’s.
After the Boer war he joined the Imperial army,
and is now a captain in the Queen’s Own Corps of
Guides. He was in action with the Indian forces
when he stopped a German bullet. Another Aus-
tralian wounded in France is Everard Dickson, a
Geelong youngster who is a second lieut. in a Lan-
cashire regiment. He got his scars on the famous
Hill 60. He came to England four years ago to
study for the Bar, and like most Australian boys in
this island volunteered directly the Kaiser trod on
little Belgium.
That Lieut. Wallingford who was men-
tioned m the cables the other day as having
been invalided from Gallipoli with a strained
heart—‘l’m sick of killing with the rifle,”
he is reported to have said—was one of the
finest shots in Britain. He was an in-
structor at the School of Musketry at Ilvtlie
and v lien tlie MAoriland Defence Depart-
ment got the loan of him to open a School
ot Musketry his departure from liytlie
funned the subject ot a debate in the House
or Commons. But Maoriland made poor
use of VY allingford’s rare skill as a rifleman
and instructor. He was stuck on a stool
given a pen, and spent liis time doing the
plodding, routine work of a clerk. The fool-
ishness of it was the joke of the service.
Wallingford . was in Australia with tlie
learn of British marksmen about eight vears
ago.
ANOTHER POWER JOINED IN.
VICTORIAN SOLDIER (at the Front): "Here’s
a bit of news—Jack Wren’s enlisted!”
SECOND DO: “ Well , things is just happening
as the papers said. The Allies is getting
stronger every day.”
The late Keir Hardie may have been an
incorruptible democrat because he formerly
flaunted a red Glengarry cap in the House
ot_ Commons, but he was a very misguided
one. For the last 10 years of Hardie’s life the
Kaiser had more reason than the democracy
of England to be grateful to him. If he
had been a German World Conquest busi-
ness agent he couldn’t have acted very dif-
ferently. His visit to India on his way to
Australia in 1907 looks very like a tour in
the Kaiser’s interests. The Socialist who
preached Home Rule for India was prac-
tically advocating rebellion in the first
place, and trying to clear the way for Ger-
man intrigue in the second place. In Aus-
tralia he was a Socialist who advocated
Home Rule whilst denouncing “militarism”
either for local defence or pro-British pur-
poses. A paid agent could have done no
more for Germany’s World Conquest cause.
And when the war broke out, and the Ger-
man Conquest cat was out of the bag, Har-
die became a spokesman of the “Independ-
ent” workers, a promoter of industrial dis-
content and a barraeker for an early peace
whilst the German hosts were still making
hell in Belgium.
Arthur Cutler, a member of the famous
Bathurst family of rifle shots, and himself
a winner of the King’s at the N.R.A. meet-
ing at Sydney, has been rejected by the re-
cruiting officer on the ground of varicose
veins. That’s the worst of this war. Now
if it had been a shindy in which the soldier
dug himself in and settled down with plenty
of ammunition to wait for a target, world-
famous shots with varicose veins could be
made of use. But when you have to chase
the enemy day and night by forced marches,
men like Cutler are quite valueless.
Lieut. Lindsay Browne, of the Royal
Irish Rifles, who wears the Military Cross,
was born at Eumore (N.S.W.). He was
in the first list of recipients of the Cross,
and, besides, within a month of going to the
Front, was twice mentioned in.despatches—
a record which will take some beating.
After general education at Sydney Grammar
School, King’s College (Goulburn) and
Rockhampton Grammar School young
Brown set forth to learn wool growing and
classing. Bradford, where he intended fin-
ishing his study, was his destination when
he left Sydney, and that’s how he came to
be in England when the trouble started.
There is 6ft. 2in. of Browne, who has
reached the advanced age of 23 and per-
forms exceptionally well in the surf as well
as on the battlefield. His father was a
fighter, too; he did bravely in the Maori
war, and was afterwards a planter in Fiji.
Love, P.M. at Sydney Central Court, last
week remarked that many country policemen
knew their bit of the law as well as the
Chief Justice—which recalls an incident.
The late Alfred Stephen, on circuit, was dis-
turbed at his pub by the row in the bar and
parlors. Coming down stairs in slippers and
dressing-gown, the old Chief found bis atten-
dant trooper among the crowd, and immedi-
ately ordered him to clear the place of the
roysterers. But the bobby knew better—
there was only one man who coukl give him
that order, and that was the licensee of the
pub. Next day the Chief referred to the
matter from the Bench, and admitted that
the constable knew the law better than he
did.-
The three Golding sisters (Mrs. K.
Dwyer and Misses Belle and Annie Gold-
ing), who lately wrote a joint letter dis
claiming approval of the N.S.W. Universa
Service League’s manifesto, have had more
’ to say in the Ma State’s public affairs than
any other group of women. Belle and
Annie both hold public positions. IN ith
Mrs. Dwyer and Miss Rose Scott they were
leaders in the Women's Franchise movement
up to the time it scored success in N. S.
Wales. But the Goldings and Miss Scott
were very different people. The Goldings
represent militancy. A man who took notes
at a debate on womanhood suffrage discov-
ered that Belle interjected 145 times and her
sister 57 times during the enemy’s speech.
Yet, though the Goldings’ fighting qualities
have been very useful, Miss Rose Scott
probably bad more to do with the success of
the Woman’s Suffrage League. Her gentle-
ness succeeded in winning powerful political
protagonists who would have been turned
into porcupines by her colleagues’ militancy.
Mrs. Dwyer has been actively associated with
the Labor movement, is on the P.L.L. Execu-
tive. a candidate for selection in the next
Senate batch, and has acted on such bodies
as the Cost of Living Commission.
“Die Mihi”: It is interesting to recall
that Captain Arthur Phillip, the first Gover-
nor of N. S. Wales, was a German, born in
Frankfort. His father, Jacob Phillip, was an
immigrant in London, who earned liis living
by teaching German. Arthur entered the
Royal Navy at 16, and was made lieutenant
at the- taking of Ilavannali in 1761. At the
close of the Seven Years’ War in 1763, he
returned to England, and got married.
Shortly after he entered the service of Portu-
gal, which was then at war with Spain, and
spent 15 years as a Portuguese soldier. When
Britain went to war with France in 1778,
Phillip rejoined the British navy, and was
made commander of the Basilisk, a fireship,
not a frigate. Thus the Ma State’s first
Governor was a German and a mercenary!

excellent “History of Australasia,” published
in Glasgow and printed in Edinburgh in
1879.

The last of the Eureka Stockade com-
batants has once more passed away. In
this latest instance it: was Michael Tuohy
the elder, of Ballan (Vie.). Tuohy was a
Cresvvick gold-seeker, when the trouble over
the Ballarat miners’ rights was at boiling-
point, and be arrived on the scene at Eureka
just in time to face a British bayonet-
charge, without any damage except to his
wardrobe. Afterwards he was tried at Mel-
bourne for treason and turned loose.
Michael Tuohy, who di'ed at Ballarat last
week, was anyway the survivor of those
who stood their trial in 1855 for the part
they took in the Ballarat riots which cul-
minated in the storming of the Eureka
Stockade on December 4, 1-854. Thirteen
of the prisoners taken on that occasion
were brought to Melbourne and stood in the
dock in January following, but all were
acquitted, and a Royal Commission put the
miners’ grievances right.

James Park, of Hobart (Tas.), is not

ments, but intends to go on scoring for a
while, lie was born in Glasgow on Sep-
tember 23, 1815, when the battle of Water-
loo was the latest news, came to Australia
75 years ago, and lias lived here ever since

He attributes his excellent state of preser-
vation to the use of whisky in moderation.
At Eugowra (N.S.W.) a rough granite
monument has been raised to the memory of
G. W. Evans, the surveyor who discovered the
Lachlan and Macquarie Rivers and prepared
the way for the first road to Bathurst. Evans
was a man of many occupations. He came
to Australia to farm, and had a grant on the
Hawkesbury. Then Macquarie gave him an
appointment, with instructions to follow up
the track of Blaxland, Wentworth and Law-
son over the Blue Mountains, which he did.
In the mid-’thii ties he had a bookseller’s busi-
ness in Bridge-street. Sydney. Later, he
was in the Tasmanian service, and what
there is left of him lies in a neglected grave
in a Hobart suburban cemetery.
Duncan McLachlan. Commonwealth Pub-
lic Service Commissioner, quits that chair in
a month or two. Born in 1853 he entered
the N. S. Wales service in 1809, and was
Under-Secretary for Mines when the Com-
monwealth collared him for a big organising
job. A brother, Hugh, rose to oe secretary
of the Railway Department. As youngsters
they were the hardworking sons of a Red-
fern grocer, and in the Service they were
tireless plodders.
Francis Knowles, Canon of Christchurch
(M.L.), who recently resigned a bunch of
diocesan offices, many of which he had held
for 36 years, was for a while after his
arrival in Lyttelton in ISSI an Inky Way-
farer. From a lawyer’s oflice in England
young Knowles went school teaching, and
before leaving the Cold Country, was a
“reader” in the Suffolk parish which
Whately. the logician, left to become Arch-
bishop of Dublin. On the voyage from Eng-
land to Maoriland Knowles conducted a
manuscript newspaper, and when he landed
he was snapped up by James Edward Fitz-
gerald, then editor of the Lyttelton Times.
and afterwards founder and first editor of
Ch.ch. Press. For nine months the future
canon “subbed” the Times, and then went
school-teaching again in Banks Peninsula.
In 1860 the Church claimed him. and he has
filled almost every post of dignity which

JIM’S SHRINE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Grim silence reigns where echoes rang
The fern-fronds and the creek between,
AVlum lustily the axeman’s clang
Brought doom to giants, tough and green—
And where Jim’s humble shrine was made
A sombre pall of green is laid!
Across the window cobwebs twine,
And in the little garden plot
Jim’s humble flowers, untended, pine—
Sweet Alice and forget-me-nots !
And robins perch upon the sill
Since all the bush around is still.
Jim heard the bugle-call that through
The forest rang: himself he gave.
No mind had he coy Fame to woo,
Yet found afar a hero's grave.
He sleeps ’neath Oriental skies,
Yet here .was brave Jim’s paradise!
Tlie bed o’ cabbages he grew
Are hearting, and his early peas
Are podding just as if they knew
They had some other eyes to please.
And lettuces are folding tight
On hearts, like Jim’s, tender and white !
Now scenes that knew the splitter's art
Are blotted out with springtime green
Since Mother Earth took him to heart
As though brave Jim had never been....
And no one knows that he is dead
Save one lone rose that hangs its head.
VICTORIA.

The WILD CAT
COLUMN
The S. Wales State industrial under-
takings, mostly established by Griffith when
he was Minister for Works, and since run
as works run. by the ITolman Government
might be expected to be, show nominally an
accumulated loss of £69,316 and an accumu-
lated profit of £48,104. But no board of
directors with an eye to booming the share
market could fake the figures more
flagrantly. For instance, take the lime
works, Taree and Botany. These, according
to accounts, show an accumulated loss
of £6595. But even F. A. Coghlan, the
Auditor-General, whose comments are usu-
ally mild enough for a Dorcas meeting,
points out that “there is a charge for' pre-
liminary trials, £1228, included in the assets
in the balance-sheet. It was intended to
have written it off from year to year out of
profits. The industry, however, was closed
down, as it was found impossible to produce
lime at a rate that would meet working
expenses. The actual loss, therefore, is
£7823.” But that isn’t all. The under-
taking having been abandoned, the assets
are worth what they would fetch for break-
ing-up purposes. The balance-sheet shows
that the lime-kiln and tram tracks at Botany
represent £6893. The kiln is of no value;
the tram tracks might be worth the odd
£393. So there is a further loss of £6500.
At Taree, where the industry has also been
abandoned, there is a kiln and track alleged
by the balance-sheet to be worth about £7OO.
For breaking-up purposes it might be worth
£lOO. If it is left where it is, as it most
likely will be, it- won’t be worth anything
in a year or two. However,! credit these
things with their estimated real value, and
then we find that, instead of this shameful
misrepresentation of a loss of £6594, there is
an actual loss of £6594 + £1228 + £6500
+ £6OO = £14,922. If the Board of a
private co. kept itself in power by making
such misrepresentations there would be
trouble ahead; and so there ought to be.
Apparently nobody takes much notice of
political scandals. This, however, is a com-
mercial scandal; and somebody should be
held responsible for it.
The limeworks are not a solitary instance.
That case is simply a typical one. The
brickworks at Homebush Bay are supposed
to have shown a profif of £7580. But a
profit in a manufacturing concern like this
can be faked by the very simple process of
allowing insufficient for depreciation. In
this case 15 p.c. is written off loose plant,
barrows and tools. In other words, it is
assumed that the barrows and tools at a
brickworks last about seven years. The
patent kilns it is reckoned will last about 40
years, and the power sub-station and such
things also about 40 years. Even the boxes
used for carrying the bricks about are
reckoned to have a life of 20 years. These
reckonings are so grotesque that they would
be humorous if they were not also so
serious. In these columns The Butxe-
tin overhauls about 800 balance-sheets
a year. Apart from two or three
wild-cat mining cos., run by people who
ought to be in gaol, it cannot recall
accounts reflecting more discredit upon
the people responsible for the policy which
directs the manner in which they shall be
presented.

Besides paying this dividend of 13 p.c. and
putting by a visible £24,703, the National
of Maoriland has paid the income tax on the
shareholders’ dividends, amounting to about
£12,000. and has increased its internal
reserves by writing another £20,000 off
premises. Certainly in considering the ex-
cellence of the 13 p.c. distributed one has to
remember that a good deal of the capital
introduced in recent years has brought a
premium with it. Twelve years ago the paid
capital was £250,000. To-day it is £750.000.
Thus £500.000 has been got in during this
period, and with it £237,500 of premium*
capital. On the new capital the dividend
is thus equal to about 8| p.c. free of income
tax —the latter a very important considera-
tion in these dimes. However, on that point
it is just as well to note that the chairman,
speaking at the annual meeting in London,
warned shareholders that the concession
might have to be discontinued. It would
have cost the bank last year hardly any
more to pay another 2 p.c. in dividend ; and
this year the tax will be even more costly.
Besides having an investment yielding so
well, the shareholder has—on paper, at any
rate —remarkably fine security. The visible
reserves are now almost equal to the paid
capital; and, in view of the persistent man-
ner in which premises have been written

lhe increase in deposits during the year is
a further instance of the strength ‘of the
Australian and Maoriland banking position
.a strength which springs almost wholly
l-oin the fact that the deposits are nowadavs
nearly all local instead of foreign, as they
were to so great an extent 20-odd years ago.
Notwithstanding the world-shaking, there
have thus been practically no withdrawals;
ou tlie other hand, as money lias come in
tor produce shipments it has been accumu-
lated at the bank, much of it for safe keep-
ing more than anything else. More per-
manent use will be sought for a good deal
of this money directly the blood-red clouds
roll away. The large holding of liquid assets
13 therefore a very proper precaution.
After 42 years’ service, 22 of them spent
as general, manager, Mr. Coates the other
day left his chair and joined the National’s
i>oaid. lhe Auckland manager—one of the
innumerable Duthies— succeeds him. Mr.
Coates leaves the bank in a remarkably
strong position, so far as figures show\ Capital
and visible reserves total £1,483,080: liabili-
ties to the public, £5,905,005. Thus for
every £1 ot the shareholders’ money there is
xo ot the public’s; and that is a very mod-
erate risk. Further, while £5,905,005 is
owing to the puMic, £3,262,497 is liquid,
leaving £2,642,508 of the debt to be repre-
sented by non-liquid assets; and of these
non-liquid assets the book value is no less
than _ £4,182,088. That gives so wide a
margin that the depositor and other creditor
may reckon themselves very well protected,
notwithstanding that, in this paper’s opinion,
the market level of freehold securities in
Maoriland has risen to ap extravagant
height, and sooner or later a general
reappraisement will be necessary. Whether
the bank will suffer in the process depends
entirely upon the margin of safety which it
requires in making its advances.
State Accident Insurance Office of
Victoria.-— The Victorian Workers’ Com-
pensation Act 1914 carried industrial insur-
ance further than it had ever gone in Aus-
tralia. The law makes insurance obligatory.
The employer carries the liability, which
extends not only to accidents but also to
specified industrial diseases.” 'ln case of
incapacity the payment is half-wages up to
30s. per week, with a maximum of £5OO.
lhe Act applies to all classes, but non-
manual workers receiving more than £250
a year are exempt. The insurance may be
effected either with approved private “in-
surers”—to use the term of the Act—or with
the State office. Penalty for non-insurance,
£2 per worker, with £1 per week during the
further period of non-insurance.
. The Act was passed early in the year, but
it was not until September—seven months
later —that this office was established : and
then of course it wasn’t organised. Two
months were spent in getting a brass plate
and a doormat and doing other even more
important things, and then business was
accepted. Meantime the insurance cos.,
which had their organisations in existence,
were collaring business. A Commissioner
had been appointed with a double-barrelled
job: first, to approve or otherwise private
“insurers”, and collect their deposits (£6OOO
each in the case of parent and £3OOO in the
case of subsidiary cos.) ; second, to manage
such business as the State Office might
secure. Thus far 46 cos. have been approved
and are now out hunting this employer’s
liability business.
The idea of the State Office is to give the
employer insurance at rock-bottom rates.
That means two things—revision of rates
as experience is gain ed ; the distribution of
any profit surplus in the shape of bonuses.
Nothing in the way of big profits is either
looked for or desired. For the present the
rates are little more than experimental ; and
whether they are on the whole too big or too
little can’t be told yet. It is true that on
the eight months’ operations, on a net
revenue of £27.502, a surplus of £19.709 is
shown. But that is not profit. The office
itself cuts it up this way :
Reserve for unexpired risks .. .. £15,464
Profit —Reserve fund .. .. £2750
Bonus reserve .. . . 1495
4,245
Total .. .. .. £19,709
Ihe reserve called for to cover unexpired
risks is. however, only an estimate; and in
this business the English experience (no
doubt. reproduced in Australia) has been
that it takes some time for the normal
claim-rate to show itself. When a man
isn’t insured lie will often struggle to work
after receiving an injury which ought to
make him lie up for a while; and it takes
him some time to get out of the habit of
thus sticking to his job. Also the employer,
when he finds out that the insurance pre-
mium has to be paid anyhow, will put a
man off if he is injured and isn’t able to do
normal work. The growth of claims which
has been noted in England has little or
nothing to do with malingering, though the
latter is often blamed for it, and no super-
vision will stop it. For the present,
therefore, all that can be said is that the
office starts off with an excellent premium
income, and that the expenses (including
all preliminaries), amounting to £l7 11s.
P.c. of net premiums, are distinctly moderate.
This matter of the expense rate is all im-
portant to the policy-holder; for if it is kept
as low as that at which the private co. can
do the business, and if the otnee only gets
its fair whack of bad risks, then obviously
tin; employer who insures with this social-
istic concern is going to get the benefit of
the profit which would go to the share-
holders in a private office. The only deduc-
tion will go to establish a reserve fund ; and
that of course is in the interest of the policy-
holder, too. The Office has no capital to
provide dividends for; yet it has the advan-
tage of the support of the entire credit of
the State. That is to say, it has all the
benefits of a very big capital without any of
its disadvantages. Given economical man-
agement it is a tough proposition for the
private insurance concern to be up against.
0.T., Ltd., was formed in 1909 to take
over the cordial-making and distributing-
business of J. Dixon and Co., of Prahrau
(Vic.). Capital was £70.090, of which
£60.944 was issued in payment for goodwill,
trade marks and “bottles in circulation.”
Subject to some remarks hereunder, this
composite item is regarded as an intangible
asset, and consequently is reckoned as the
deficit with which the co. started:—

fin these figures “Goodwill, trade marks and bottles
in circulation” are not reckoned as assets.
For practical purposes the table isn’t worth
much. The main disturbing element is that
item “Goodwill, trade marks, bottles in cir-
culation, etc.” Twelve months ago it stood
at £86,864. Now it stands at only £59,864.
That looks as though £30,000 of capital for-
merly represented by a doubtful asset had
been made good and unimpeachably sound
out of profits; and the profits in the table
are credited accordingly. That accounts for
the fine £31,652, whereas the directors say
that the profit was only £5963. out of which
they write off £4312. What seems to have
happened is that a new co. has been formed,
or perhaps two or three new cos. (there is
reference to one in England), and “shares
in other cos.” now appears as an asset worth
£54,000. It looks as though a great part of
that is goodwill, too; in other words, the
£30,000 which formerly was more or less
frankly goodwill, etc., is now represented by
shares which have probably even a larger
proportion of goodwill in them.
The O.T. business consists of the manu-
facture and sale of various cordials. One
of them, 0.T., gives the co. its name. The
sale depends very largely upon continuous
advertising. In two years to June, 1914,
£46,718 was spent in shrieking the virtues
of O.T. into the world’s ears. All but a few
hundred pounds, of this money was provided
out of then current profits; the small balance
of money spent on business extension, and
not paid for out of revenue at the time, has
been written off now. It has been suggested
that the money thus spent is really an asset,
and that the co. will get the benefit of the
advertising for years to come. Had normal
conditions prevailed the co. might have
profited a good deal by past expenditure.
But it had the bad luck to strike these shock-
ing times just after the seed had been sown.
It is a question whether much of it will be
any good when the world gets normal again,
though the past has shown that, even if the
expenditure has to be repeated, it can
produce big results. Meantime, . how-
ever excellent the chances may be to
make good profits, the security is only
very moderate. Of the capital of
£133,276 in £1 shares, about £35,000 net is
in stock, premises and plant, and book
debts; the balance is in goodwill, trade
marks, bottles in circulation and shares in
other cos.

The eo.'s concession runs till 3925: so there
are 30 years left in which to repay the
remaining capital. Already, though a
repayment was made only a couple of years
ago, there is a nice little sum in the stock-
ing. The Sinking Fund (all except £25,59
invested apart from the business) has lately
moved along in ‘ this brisk wa v :
1912 .. £20,142 | 1913 "... £25,206
(£26,250 repaid at this stage.)
1914 .. £5,574 | 1915 .. £10,964
So. disregarding the repayment to share-
holders. the lay-by, plus the additions to
I’, and L. account, lias behaved as follows:
Sinking P. & L. Year’s
Fluid. Balance. Lay-bv.
1912 .. £20,142 £3210 £4105
1913 .. 25.206 3570 54->4
1914 .. 31.8-24 4065 7113
1915 .. 37,214 4902 6227
Tliat is an average lay-by of over £5700 a
year; and at that rate the co. won’t have
much trouble about returning its capital.
True, there is a part of the £15,866 now
saved up and shown as reserves that isn’t
liquid. As at June 30 the liquid and semi-
liquid assets were £13,058 and the liabilities
£4722. But the liquid assets are piling up
rapidly. Last year the additions to tin-
sinking fund investments —all free Stock
Exchange securities of the gilt-edged sort —
were valued at £5390; and the accounts
were squared by writing down the book
value of plant, etc., by a similar amount.
Therefore, as an amount equal to
the annual addition to the sinking
fund is written off the works, the
sinking fund doesn’t figure as a reserve
in the published accounts. And theoretically
that is no doubt the proper practice, since
every year the works diminish in value so
far as this co. is concerned. In Melbourne
as in Sydney there is electric competition;
but the Melbourne hydraulic concern seems
to be rather better able to hold up its end
of the stick. The gross revenue of this Mel-
bourne co. for a few years past has been as
follows :
1910 .. £19,247 | 1913 .. £20,010
1911 .. 19,578 | 1914 .. 20,119
1912 .. 20,375 | 1915 .. 19,237
Even that isn't much to boast about, con-
sidering the general business expansion that
was in progress up to the time of William’s
outburst.

It is no use going back beyond 1912, and
if is no use showing what are alleged to
be reserves. The position is that originally
there was a capital of £17,500, all but
£2500 of it goodwill. The co. had only
a short lease, and the capital represented
by goodwill should of course have been saved
up in cash during the. currency of the lease.
Nothing, however, of that sort was done,
and to get a renewal a lot of money had to
be spent on the landlord’s property, and
that meant more capital. Subsequently,
falling into the hands of tidier financiers,
the accounts were straightened up, and tin-
increased capital was written down to
£12,250, of which, apparently, in June, 1912.
£9044 was goodwill and other paper. Then
steps were taken to establish a sinking fund ;
and the first table shows that, after paying
the dividend and keeping things in order,
very respectable progress is being made.
The accumulation in three years is £1710;
and the lease has still 15 years to go. The
shareholders ought to do very well out of
it. If from a hotel in such a position and
with such a connection the management
can’t in normal times make 25 p.c. on a
Capital of £12,250, there is something wrong.

The society has come through a trying year
very well. It. had been making loan-
fast, considering its size; and had there been
a sudden slump in property values and in
the earnings of the people, it might—
probably would—have been badly hit. For-
tunately, though there has no doubt bee» a
shrinkage in values, it hasn’t been such as
to induce borrowers to throw properties on
the hands of the mortgagees. In other words,
properties have very rarely fallen in value
below what was owing on them. Further,
as the earnings of the public have been fairly
well sustained, except in the country (and
rliat was owing to a drought which has
passed), n 6 doubt repayments have been
well kept up; and the longer they are.kept
up the safer is the society. As for new
loans, made during the year, and on which
few repayments have yet been made, there
isn t much risk in them, or there shouldn’t
be. because a society, knowing that condi-
tions are explosive, would naturally take
lots of precautions.
On the whole, then, it: can be said that,
unless something almost unthinkable hap-
pens, the society has passed the danger zone,
and passed it with extraordinarily little
damage. (Inly one property has been thrown

Efficient grinding is one of the many problems
that mine managers have to solve. The Ilardinge
Conical Mills have proved to the Calumet and Hecla
Mining Co. that grinding is not such a difficult
problem ; they have installed 64 of them, and say
“the Ilardinge Conical Mill is the most efficient
grinding machine we have yet gotten hold of.” If
they say this of the mills, it should be worth the
while of mine managers here to inquire about them.
The Austral Otis Eng. Co., Ltd., of Melbourne, are

After looking at Edna May group a
Bulletin man wires the following conclu-
sions :
(1) Edna May has roughly 755. per share in
sight above the 225 ft. level.
(2) It will have at least a couple of levels intact
and the equivalent of a third before the whole of
the shoot passes into the Deeps mine.
(3) Apart from what is in the ground undeveloped
above 225 ft., and reckoning that only half as much
gold will be taken out from below that point as has
already been extracted from and is in sight above it,
shareholders can count on getting an additional
£8 155., or £7 10s. in all.
(4) The water trouble in Edna May, of which
such a song has been made, will be overcome without
much difficulty; and as the channel seems to extend
upwards in the direction of the Deeps boundary and
downwards towards Edna’s shaft, there is just a
possibility of the Deeps shaft missing the heavy
flow altogether and only meeting the water running
through the country.
(5) The Deeps and Central dispute can best be
settled by the Central putting down a bore in the
south-west corner of its north ground—that is, if it
is game enough to do the work.
(G) The Deeps’ greatest danger is strangulation
by weak finance.
(7) In order to avoid the folly so often seen on
mining fields of two companies working an area
which could be better and more cheaply worked.by
one, the Edna and Deeps should amalgamate.
The Broken Hill miners have once more
told the law that it lias nothing to do with
them! They held a meeting and decided
to defy the Federal Arbitration Court and
refuse to work on Saturdays. The regis-
trar of the Court wired by direction of the
president (Justice Higgins) pointing to a
provision for a fine of £lOOO and a few
other things. What —the law dare to
threaten them, the Broken Hill miners!
They would let it see who was master. And
they did. They struck work that day. And
that will be the end of it, as much the same
thing has been the end of a dozen other
similar engagements. Why should the law
make any bones about it? The Broken
Hill miners are its master.
* * * *
Foresight isn’t the Edna May’s long suit.
The directors missed the Central through a
foolish haggling over 2000 reserve shares,
and the Deeps they turned down absolutely
though it was offered at little more than the
price of a shoe-string. A good horse makes
a good jockey, but a big lot of shareholders
believe now that their directors never learned
to ride.
* * * *
Kalgurli’s manager regretfully announces
that as a result of poor developments the mill
has gained considerably on the mine during
the past 12 months, and that only a year's
visible supply of ore remains. The returns,
he states, must shrink, but to what extent he
is unable to say on account of the difficulty
of estimating the average value of any one
block of ore, let alone the lot. Unless the
unexpected happens he reckons the mine
cannot last much more than a year.
The local paper indignantly denies the report
that the Black Range Co.’s old mine at
Sandstone (W.A.) needs a coffin. It states
that a body of ore has been struck in the
south end which will enable it to do with-
out a funeral for some time. The local idea
is that with its latest acquisition at the
Pinnacles the co. will earn more dividends
for shareholders than it has been paid to
date —to wit, £254,000.
Boulder Perseverance shares can now be
had for a few pence. A few rich patches
have given monthly profits, ranging from
£624 to £3471, since March last, but these
sweeteners are rapidly being used up, and
it is getting harder and harder to find others
to take their place. The show is done tor
at depth. #
Jack Lenneberg, one of the best pro-
spectors Westralia ever produced, has
got hold of something good in the Sandfly,
at Marvel Loch. Gold is showing well at
50ft., and company promoters and mine
buyers are beginning to crane their necks
over the dump and inquire the price.*
Star Syndicate (W.A.) is trying to place
7945 reserve shares to raise more money _ to
develop the Sirdar mine, Magnet, on which
a favorable report has been obtained. £2OOO
is required to carry out the work contem-
plated and provide means for conveying ore
already available to the Morning Star lease
(on which the Star also holds an option)
for treatment.

There’s the making of a sharp squeeze in
Edna Deeps. The West has been on the
sell even worse than in Edna’s juvenile days.
With only 40,000 contribs. to play with
there may be danger, unless some of the
big holders help their forlorn brethren with
scrip. One speculator • testifies to being
owed 9000 shares and being unable to get
50. Adelaide has also done a bit of a
plunge, and Sydney has joined in, so. there
will be some excitement before all deliveries
are made.

Alec Peacock’s Ballarat office is worrying-
more about the Hope mine at Beaufort and
its chances of developing payable wash than
about the boss’s political prospects. A split
in the gutter upset everything, so a dive
has to he made into the No. 2 shaft, to get
under the deep ground. About 200 ft. of
driving will i*each the lead, and the outlook
isn’t bad. Yields to date run into 75000 z.,
but no div. so far —just enough gold to
entice calls out of the alluvial man’s pouch.
* * * *
New Moon, Bendigo, is looking bright
again on the strength of a narrow saddle
formation got in poking out at 545 ft. So
tight were things at the time that calls were
ahead, notwithstanding the dividend record
of £357,000. The making of gold in "a slide
of stone over the saddle swept out debits
and set prices jigging. But there are three
little niggers on the fence: (1) the pos-
sibility of the shoot being irregular, (2)
the tailing-off of values to the north, and
(3) the fact that the Suffolk United boun-
dary is within a hand’s-throw. Getting fail-
gold north ought to make Suffolk look up,
and some of the shrewd heads have eyes on
it. Still, Suffolk will have to drive south
a good deal before it can claim to be in the
hunt.
* * * *
W. A. Maxfield, the new man at the
Poseidon Alluvial (Vic.), has got it into his
head that the lost gutter is away to the
north. This is on the strength of small
wash-ups that have topped the ounce mark.
What is wanted is proof that the lead has
rambled beyond the glacial deposit through,
which it ran in prehistoric days. If Max-
field can show that, Poseidon oughtn’t to be
finished with, because the scour of the lead
ought to carry the gold on to the. slates
ahead. An exploratory rise is going up
600 ft. away from the shaft, and if it finds
favorable country Poseidon may not be as
near a dead ’un as the bears want it to be.

S. J. Plain runs Wattle Gully, Chewton
(Vic.), as a small thing with big possibili-
ties. It is on the Francis Ormond line, near
where dead George Lansell spent a fortune
trying to get into the Bendigo horizon of
Silurian slates. / Wattle Gully has dipped
into eastern country to pick up the run of
geological leather-jackets that gave Spring
Gully and the old Garfield an occasional
meal. But crosscutting isn’t sufficient, so
some lioney-tongued lad in Plain’s office has
persuaded Minister Drysdale Brown to bore
above and below the crosscut for lodes, at
spots chosen by the geologists. This will be
a bit of right prospecting, as Castlemaine
has saddles by the mile, hut is without cash
or pluck to find out if the richness of
Forrest Creek and the gullies around the
town exhausted the gold -in the field’s won-
derful belt of rocks. Bendigo hung in the
balance for years just the same. Meantime
Plain’s crowd is mining on the saddle at
350 ft., as well as having a shot at-Shanks’s
lode at 420 ft. The reef is there, but the
gold is shy.

From a man who has been barracking for
the Vic. miner for 30 years past: —
Unless the miners’ unions are out to scrap mining-
in Victoria, they ought to regard the warnings of
men like Jim McCrorey. Except in rare spots,
deep-lead mining can’t stand heavier charges;
already Great Southern, Rutherglen, and Burnt
Creek, Maryborough, have shut down with big blocks
of lead undeveloped. Duke Extended, with 14dwt.
ground, is only just keeping off the rocks; and big-
prospecting shows on the Langi gutter are sheltering
from the storm, while New Langi and South Langi
are only just pulling - through. Where costs for-
merly kept about 12dwt. they now reach 14dwt.
Most of the trouble is over the efficiency of the
worker. It isn't that the pay is too high. It is
that the labor results are too small. Deep-lead
mining isn’t the most comfortable of jobs, so when
things were booming before the war many of the best
alluvial men jumped at the chance of getting out of
the mud and into the sunlight. That partly explains
why costs have sprung up lately. In a little mine
like the Hope, eighteen-twentieths of the £30,000
of gold w - on has gone to pay labor. It is much the
same with every deep-lead mine except Cathcart
Central t and with taxation up, once a call-making
mine is closed there will be small chance of getting
it re-opened. The new “log” may shut down even
Lyell. The miners’ leaders need to measure up the
times. They may easily do incalculable harm to
their own people just now if they don’t proceed very
warily.

Belgium and Perseverance, near Dunolly
(Vic.), is just south of the Queen’s Birth-
day, and seems to have avoided all her
majesty’s gold and good luck. Conrad
Dyring, an old Danish storekeeper from the
Itiverina, who has been following mining
since he gave up selling blue.vs and tinned
dog, says he has got something good below
200 ft. W. IT. Cundy backs up Dyring, and
says sink, sink ! A 30-ton crushing from the
stone available is waiting to go through.
They talk about 2oz.

Having got out of some of its difficulties,
the manufacture of carbide of calcium is
now talked of by the Hydro Electric Power
Co. (Tas.). It is proposed to build a fac-
tory at North West Bay, and a Swedish
engineer has arrived to plan out the works
and estimate costs.

J. S. Reid is losing his punch. Well, he is
not as young as he was; ne was more than
middle-aged when he dragged a little print-
ing press across country to Silverton, in the
first days of the Barrier field, and presently
fell into the Broken Hill Prop.—and that
was just upon 30 years ago. After Broken
Hill J. S. lieid never struck a winner of
any consequence. Tarrawingee and Euriowie
and Emu Bay Railway and Cliillagoe cost
the public a million or two; and all the
public ever got out of any of them was
hope. It has been J. S. Reid’s job for over
20 years to supply the hope in return for
Board fees; and he has been the Australian
pastmaster at the business. But, as men-
tioned already, he is losing his punch. It
has taken him all this year, up to now, to
look for reasons why Cliillagoe shareholders
shouldn’t feel gloomy about the proceedings
up to December 31 last. And he hasn’t been
able to find any. True, “the impossibility of
meeting the debenture interest cliafge has
been a matter of extreme regret to the direc-
tors, who hope before long to be able to show
that in the exercise of this leniency the
debenture-holders adopted a prudent course
for themselves and the co.” But that is very
vague. Two years ago the Mulligan coalfield
was to be the newest savior of the co. It
was going to feed the co.’s smelters with
coke at a fraction of the old cost. A recon-
struction was engineered (Cliillagoe is so
used to reconstructions that such things
almost engineer themselves) to develop and
equip Mulligan. The Government, good old
cow, was milked for the cost of a connecting
railway line 30 miles. Before the line, was
built the whole mining and smelting business
collapsed; and the State’s hard-borrowed
money is now in a line which starts from
Gloom and ends at Despair. Nothing has
been done of late at the Cliillagoe mines,
which have’ long since been proved to be
small, tricky things at best; and, though fine
seams of coking coal have been developed at
Mulligan, there is no demand worth mention-
ing for the substance.
Meantime, this very newest Chil-
lagoe co.’s profit and loss account
has gone £60,270 to the bad, a drift of
£27,751 during the year; and the finances
are in a shocking state, notAvitlistanding that
the present co. was formed only three years
ago. Apart from the load of debentures,
which quite swamps the share capital, the co.
had sundry creditors for £28,892 and over-
drafts of £13,233 on December 31; against
which were sundry debtors and cash and
metal totalling £17,984. Two and a half years
ago the shareholders were told cheerfully
that “the apparent surplus remaining in
favor of the co. is £927,000’’; but as it is all
in mines which won’t pay, and railways
which serve the mines that Avon’t pay, and
reduction works which only pay nominally
when they make charges Avhich the mines
couldn’t pay if they had to do it in cash,
the estimate was of course a joke. Mr.
Reid doesn’t feel up to that sort of thing
now.
The struggles of the mining battler for a
crust. At Mafeking (Vic.), where the sluic-
ing claims have been held up for lack of
Avater for about tAVo years, this is lioav things
are now
AVe have had two heavy showers of rain, each
lasting 14 hours, with a two-hour spell in. between.
It was the biggest flood the oldest inhabitant has
any recollection of. It burst our dam, and covered
our gold in the race tinder hundreds of tons of dirt;
also it burst the sludge dam in three places. Our
claim is chaos. We had a lot of the race cleaned
up and ready to put through the cradle. The flood
washed all that away, and the place where it tvas
stacked is buried up. If we ever start again tve
will have the last four months’ work to do over
again. All the claims are much the same. We have
all Avatar possible turned off the field till Ave
repair the sludge dam.
The water all turned off! The irony of it
—after waiting two years !

“Rigolo”: Why “Oof Bird” (B. 23/9/T5)
. should champion the State geologists and
Government Geologist’s Department of W.A.
by claiming that “over here in the West they
are paid to protect the public, and so far
they have done their work uncommonly
well,” is incomprehensible. Did the Govern-
ment Geologist’s branch of the Mines Depart-
ment try in any way to protect the public
when those wild cats, the Bank of England
and Block 45, were being floated? Did it
do its work uncommonly well when the
Kanowna mine was floated? Or the London-
derry, or the General Gordon? Did it do
anything to protect the public when the
Boulder Deep Level South affair was attract-
ing public money, or when the unjustifiable
Bullfinch boom was being inflamed? A
geologist’s branch is not meant to protect
the public. Its duty is to get out in the field
and survey the rocks, and make plenty of
plans. Does the W.A. Department do this?

A
WOMAN’S
LETTER
Sydney, October 4, 1915,
My Dear Arini, —
On Thursday Mrs. Andy Fisher flung a
bottle of Australian vintage at the cruiser
Brisbane’s sharp nose, after manager King-
Salter and Naval Minister Jensen had given
a last anxious look to the plans for getting
the duck off her wooden nest. The G.-G. and
his household; the local Governor, with
General Finn's feathered toque just behind
his ear ; Admiral Oreswell and his wife ; Cap-
tain Baillie-Hamilton, of the cruiser Dash,
and other Scots from the same craft; Russell
French, attended by his quaint rounded
bowler; a large helping from the N.S.'W.
Parliament—these and others crowded the
platforms. Archbishop Wright was the first
to friskily leap ashore from the last boat to
reach Cockatoo dockyard. lie was followed
by a rush of the Allies’ Consuls in their best
millinery. Presently the Jap representa-
tive’s congratulations on the baptism of the
Brisbane incited other compliments upon the
arrival of a baby Shimizu.
The Indian guard stood at attention —an
immovable column that looked like a page
torn from an old picture-book. The brilliant
red of their full-dress tunics flamed against
I lie Australian khaki and the quiet togs of
the naval boys on duty. Apparently an
Indian guard would consider even the flick
of an eyelash a breach of discipline. They
turned the impassive countenances of bronze
statues to meet the local stare. Lieut.
Hastings, the youngster in charge, is a small
size in Grenadier Guardsmen. He has had
only three months’ experience in the land of
'■hits and curried livers. But what he lacks
in inches he makes up in dignity. His ad-
vance at the head of the gorgeous trappings
was like an unexpected slice of Durbar.
The official lunch table, where the Elect
sweltered cheerfully under a corrugated iron
roof, ran across one end of the huge shed.
Society clambered up to this loft by car-
peted steps. Then it dropped thankfully
into its chair and seized the menu to while
away the time till vice-royalty unfolded its
table-napkin. Amongst the husbands who
refused to be parted from their wives was
Justice Rich. He and his lady sat together
instead of talking to someone else while the
asparagus went round.
Most of the frocking at Randwic-k this
Spring ran to voiles either striped or
heavily punctuated with coin spots. Glace
silk came along with a rush. Though it is
an illusion and a snare so far as “wear” is
concerned, it doesn’t strain at its moorings
in its first youth. New glace, notably in
the embroidered species, with sprigs' of
flowers, is handsome and well-behaved.
Later in the summer it will break up pre-
maturely into tattered, disreputable old
age. But that is not yet. In Saturday’s
cyclonic gusts the stiff, shiny silk stood the
racket better than the billowy muslins.
The quiet tone of the race dressing, and
the rare intrusion of expensive i*ags, sug-
gested that Woman had only taken off her
Red Cross expression for an hour or two.
In fact, hardly as much as that in some
cases; for Sister Susie flashed an occasional
knitting-needle in the big stand. Those
stern souls who think she shouldn’t smile at
all must have been soothed by the reflection
that the Summer Girl had an uncommonly
strenuous day on Saturday. Her flounces
stood out like torn sails; her eyes had the
tense, bicycle expression; and one hand
hung on to her gossamer hat. The new
millinery is as fragile as a moth’s wing, and
if flapped in the warm west wind like an
exhausted butterfly.
The G.-G. and Lady Helen, with Lady
Doris Blackwood, took refuge in the pen.
Herself wore a pale Quaker shade of grey,
with a plumed hat; and the iwtite friend
was like a little Reckitts’ blue-bag with a
floral relief. Governor Strickland and
daughter Mary—the latter in the forget-me-
not blue of her eyes—had young Lieut.
Hughes at their elbow.
The Tom Hughes lady was elaborately
scalloped in black in the new fashion. She
had a busy time to keep her gossamer mil-
linery from soaring to Heaven. One of the
Knox gilds was elegantly striped in cross
bands of the ragingly popular blue on a
lily-white gown. Mrs. C. E. Waters was
the owner of a choice sprigged glace, with
small pink buds dotted over its generous
expanse. Mrs. Kenna struck one of the new
notes of simplicity in white. The Arthur
Allens turned up with a daughter or two.
Mrs. Tom Rolin, delightfully flounced in
black, managed to keep a small white hat
in position at an angle of 44 degrees. Mrs.
Alee Hay billowed in white. Like a willow
wand in full sail she was almost blown
down some steps by a very rude gust. John
Spencer Brunton for once strolled the lawn
without his comely wife, who is in N’York
or thereabouts. Society in general had the
strained expression of being torn to bits.
Captain Haskett-Smith, the newly-
arrived A.D.C., who came over the border
with the Scottish laird, is convalescing
after something sudden that happened to
him at the Front. At least he is supposed
to be. He parries banal Society questions,
and maintains an icy silence when there’s
a reference to his health. Captain Foxton,
the local brand of A.D.C., who took a place
behind the G.-G.’s chair when the great
exodus began, is getting large and sleek.
He is here too.
The Walter Johnstons, of Karori, near
Wellington (M.L.), are in Sydney for the
week of clothes and horses. W.J. is of the
third generation of the First Flight familv of
his name. His uncle, Charles Johnston, has
six sons at the war.
Excellency Ferguson strolled in from
Admiralty House to his neighbors, the
Yacht Squadron, on Sunday. The first
yachtsman he spoke to didn’t know who
the stranger was, and gave a bleak “no” to
the question whether he (Ronald M. Fer-
guson) could habitually hang his skiff up
at the club’s wharf. Explanations were
followed by whiskies for those who wanted
them. His Ex., who follows the King till
peace comes along, did his duty in coffee.
Owing to the races and other excitements,
only the local nobility saw Balmain crown
its carnival Queen, Edith Butt. Putting
aside his family of young bull-pups and the
black velvet coat of his off-duty hours, Dr.
Bob Stopford mounted the royal chaise as
Lord High Chamberlain.
Mrs. J. H. P. Murray, wife of the
Papuan chieftain, has been in town to take
her small son Pat out sightseeing. The
baby of the Murray family is at school at
Riverview. The eldest hope, Terence, who
is a subaltern in the Prince of Wales’s
Leinster Regiment, has been twice wounded
in the French lighting. He was mentioned
in despatches for his strenuous methods at
Neuve Chapelle. In a hurried convalescence
he put the usual question to Miss Phillipa
Kitchener, who gave the right answer.
She’s a niece of the Kitchener and a daugh-
ter of the late Genex-al Sir Walter of that
ilk.
Governor Strickland opened the combined
art show in Grace Bros.’ galleries last week.
Daughter Mary, shepherded by Miss Birch,
made a dutiful progress round the wares.
Julian Ashton mounted the rostrum to thank
his Ex. for giving the show a good shove
off. Then the blithe John Lane Mullins,
after dragging two chairs for the sub-regal
ladies through a mass of women, brown-
paper parcels and infants, skipped on to the
platform. With a few words to the point
he handed the Governor a gold replica of the
Dardanelles medal struck by the artists to
help the war funds. The opening ceremony
tailed off with his Ex.’s reply. This in-
cluded a warm expression of the joy with
which he will pass the trophy on to his
Australian-born daughter. The youngest
Miss Strickland is just at the age when she
would try to cut her back teeth on a gift of
this kind, so it’s to be locked up for a
while.
Women painters show a prolific brush at
the Amalgamated Art Show. Mrs. Emily
Paul’s versatile talents have a dash at mini-
atures, still life and landscape. Mrs. Hed-
ley Parsons, who can paint a boat more con-
vincingly than any other female brush we
have, has some strong work in craft of
varied tonnage. Florence Rodway special-
ises in the dewy-eyed beauty of the Aus-
tralian infant. The Maoriland artist, Maud
Kimbell, shows alluring pictures of France
before the German explosion. Isobel
McWhannel, Clarice Sanford, Winifred
Elliott and Lilian Chauvel are included in
the petticoat section.
At a meeting of the Professional Women’s
Association the other evening their backers
put the more rabid speakers for and against
national service into the ring to open the
combat. Miss Annie Golding, the Trades
Hall lady, sketched a deep-blue picture—
from hearsay—of the horrors of barracks
life. The conscriptionists then requested
the informative Mrs. Laura Huffman to
put on the gloves. The large literary lady,
who knows Germany, France and Switzer-
land almost as well as she knows Neutral
Bay, scored her first blood by removing a
few misconceptions. She repudiated, in
velvet tones, any notion that Australians
had the faintest idea of copying the Prussian
system. Referees agreed that the Huffman
lady had won on a clean knock-out.
The Dun lops, of Wollstonecraft, went off
in the Moldavia on the trail of their two
wounded sons. Leslie, the elder, is now in
an English hospital after a nasty smack on
the head from the Turks. Albert, who is a
doctor like his brother and parent, hasn’t
been located since the news of his mishap
came through. Father and mother hope to
pick up a wireless message to put them on
the right track.
The garden fete is in full bloom this
month. It is the war-time survival of the
old lawn party of frivolous frockmg and
race-time top-hats and lavender gloves. Now
it is out for business. The most tremendous
effort of the kind is a fruit and flower festi-
val in the gorgeous I aralla garden on Octo-
ber 23. The Concord heiress has lent both
her grounds and her fine business head to the
occasion. Visitors will have to produce 2s. Gd.
before they get the freedom of the Yaralla
turf —proceeds go to a Battalion Comforts
Fund.
There was a well-known Maoriland bride
in the Irish mail wreckage, but she had the
luck to get off without anything more seri-
ous than a bruise or two. The lady is now
Lady Lees Knowles. She used to be one
of the Ogilvie Grant clan who planted
their family tree in M.L. years and years
ago.
Will Dyson’s war cartoons and others are
hanging in Anthony Hordern’s galleries.
Amongst the others is a soulful picture of
Mrs. Britannia’s millinery before that sur-
prised old lady had sniffed the stew that
was simmering in Potsdam. Dyson cleverly
evolves a flyaway bonnet out of the usual
helmet.
Amongst the travellers who had the bad
luck to be damaged in the Irish mail disaster
was Mrs. Dominic Daly’s daughter Nina.
They used to be Sydney folks, but of late
Mrs. Dominic has written of London fashion
for the S. M. Herald.
The country is still having them. A fete
in aid of the Red Cross brought all the
neighbors to Angledool station —which is on
the crimson tassels of the sunset, beside the
Queensland border. The lady in charge was
Mrs. J. R. Robertson, who belongs to an old
Burwood family. Father was the late John
Acton Dawson, and grandpa was “Honest
John,” of the Sydney legal firm. £216 was
bagged by the party.
The slim, attractive Eileen Doak, of a
Neutral Bay family, said “I will” to the
usual musical accompaniment the other
day. The ’groom was young Makinson, of
the legal household which has been charging
6s. Bd. for its opinion for two generations.
The 0.5.R.A., which unabbreviated means
Overseas Shipping Representatives’ Associa-
tion, ushered in what Kendall calls the
“many-flowered October” with a Great Lunch
at the Australia. Tables were decorated in
the red, white and blue scheme, with wonder-
ful models of ships and Neptune properties,
such as anchors and tridents, so artistically
done that the shipping reps, and bankers
and legislators who formed the 58-strong
guest-corps thought it worth While to bring
the souvenirs away with them. Prime Mini-
ster Fisher attacked his saddle of lamb
whilst the band played “Your King and
Country Need lou,” and the cheese souffle
was very approi riately accompanied by the
“Girl in the Taxi” waltz. Mr. E. Owen Cox
was in the chair.
The world is rather cold to tennis just
now. So the former visit of Gordon Lowe,
who has the figure of a greyhound in train-
ing and the nose of an English duke, had
almost passed into oblivion. During this
visit he appeared in a Revue which his wife
arranged, with the aid of local society, for
Red Cross purposes. But he knows more
about racquets than he does about the stage.
At the second Variety show for the Red
Cross on October 2 the Repertory was full to
the doors. Then someone thoughtfully
opened the windows and saved us all from
suffocation. The charming sprite of the even-
ing was Thelma Maddrell, of Braidwood, and
brother Percy was the male comic star.
Society crowded in to see its friends behind
the footlights, and affably discussed the races
till the talented performers’ last note floated
to the rafters, whereupon (still affable) it
gave way to uproarious applause. Dora
Alexander and Phyllis Nicholson and a tribe
of Potts Pointers—including the Gordon girls
from Roslyn Gardens—sang and danced and
made heroic efforts to bang the stage with
shillelaghs in a chorus. Montague Stephen,
a slightly bald gentleman of blameless man-
ners, did his best in the kind of song and
dance that George Lauri used to fill with
lively gags. Mrs. Gordon Lowe, at the ’cello,
wore a pair of handsome shoulders, which
rose milk-white over a low-cut black velvet
gown. Dorothy Galbraith high kicked, to
the great delight of the “knuts”; and an
Eastern Revue, gorgeously clad, salaamed the
finish. Flowers galore were flung or handed
over the footlights. Percy Maddrell got off
with a huge trophy of wired carrots in the
form of a shower bouquet.
R. A. Society’s private view hit the first
race meet, and Art got the worst of the
collision. A faithful few were blown from
Rand wick about 4 p.m. on the wings of the
dust storm. Premier Holman conscienti-
ously tracked the exhibits with the help of
a catalogue, and the Ernest Broughtons
were amongst the scanty afternoon callers.
Dr. Gladys Stephen, of the Stephen
family which so long supplied Botany with
its legislator, was married in St. Andrew's
Cathedral the other evening. The ’groom,
who hails from Narrabri, is Stanley Stafford.
Like his bride, he handles a stethoscope.
The G. Earp family had a busy day on
September 30. After seeing Baby Brisbane
get her first suck of wine they hurried back
to Point Piper to hear a visiting parson say
grace at lunch. In the afternoon they had
a crowd to drink tea with Grafton’s Anglican
Bishop Druitt and discuss the needs of the
Bush Brotherhood.
Artist J. Muir Auld is showing his brusli-
work in Beard Watson’s premises. It is
worth a step that way.
At the Gordon fete, opened on Saturday
by the Cullen dame, bouncing cabbages sold
for a shilling apiece at Mrs. Aluworth’s
stall. Mere cakes brought in £8 or £lO te
the cash-box, which will be emptied for oui
wounded.
Australian sculptor Fail-lie Cuninghame,
looking pink and pleasant, has become a
Bed Cross nurse. She got into No. 1 Hospi-
tal, London, from Gravesend Hospital, where
she had been head cook and bottlewashcr
for soldiers. Now her name is down amongst
the “Urgents” at Devonshire House.
Another artist, Miss Esther Barker, of
Canterbury (M.L.), who had a picture hung
in the Royal Academy and promptly sold,
has laid aside her palette and entered as pro-
bationer in an infirmary near Maidenhead in
order to release for Red Cross work some
woman better qualified.
Esther Mitchell, the Hunter’s Ilill girl
who started in “The Blue Bird,” is appear-
ing in “Stop Thief.” After getting her
foot firmly in the profesli with the Oscar
Asclie Co., Esther had two tours through
Botha’s country, and picked up much valu-
able experience in acting and packing up.
The fair and fluffy Maie Sydney (May
Peach) is on her way to Sydney from
Colombo. The former Sombra of “The
Arcadians” changed her name to Reynolds
two or three years ago. Hubby is now at
the Front, so Maie brings baby Reynolds
home to see Grandma.
Billies for our boys in the Dardanelles
are the most raging epidemic—except
measles—of the moment. They are just the
thing to hold the Christmas goods any girl
can pack up for the man in the trenches.
The R. A. Society’s rooms buzzed with a
gift billy-tea for the 13th Battalion com-
forts fund the other afternoon. Mary
Makinson remarked—amidst the terrors cif
a guessing competition—that the 13th had
been in Gallipoli since April 26.
Dr. Kate Ardill, of Sydney, is collecting
her kit in London, and is off to the Front.
She is said to be the tenth Australian
woman doctor to push into the thick of the
trouble.
The distaff side of the limes Noad family
is now camped near Sandhurst, the place
where they turn out British subalterns by
the gross. The buxom Mrs. Noad is a sister
of our own Spruce Myth.
The Mclntosh gave r tea party at the
Australia last week to welcome Ella Cas-
pers, who is one of the present stars of the
Tivoli circuit.
A Manly girl, Miss Usher Henderson, left
by the last boat for the Solomon Isles. When
she steps ashore she is going to say “I will”
to George Christie Holmes, whose father is
a Southampton (Eng.) man, with a few
letters after his name. Amongst the girl’s
send-off presents was a bride’s postbag, an
ingenious arrangement filled with letters from
enthusiastic friends. The traveller promised
to read one (to herself) every day.
Miss Anita Onslow, well known in Sydney
as a vigorous offshoot of the Camden Park
tree, is trying to do her bit for Home De-
fence. _ She is secretary to the Women's
Signalling Corps, of which Kitchener’s
loquacious sister, Mrs. Parker, is president.
One more anxious Sydney woman is mak-
ing a sorrowful search iii Europe for a
missing relative. When the war broke out
Aileen Alpen, of Strathfield, had a brother
in Brussels; and then the earth seemed to
open and swallow him. Like any other
woman in such a case she stamps her foot
and asks “Why don’t they do more?”: —
’Buses, theatres, tubes, trains here in London
crowded with soldiers; in the streets tens of thou-
sands more, and so many of them drunk! Always
you ask and always you are told: “They’re in train-
ing 1 Don’t he impatient—they’ll be at the Front
directly 1” Directly? Oh, but the agony of the
waiting. And is this training? The slackness of it
all is appalling. I went down to Hendon and
thought 1 should see hundreds of aeroplanes in the
making, and counted just two, and about 50 work
men.
And so we muddle through.
Yours affectionately,
VANDORIAN.

The soldier
who goes to the front
—keep an Edison
Record of his voice!
f/
Mothers, wives, sisters, sweethearts
and all relatives and friends wonld
dearly cherish a record of the voice
of the soldier who goes to the Front.
While he is fighting yon can, in
this way, hear Ids beloved voice
whenever you desire. This will
prove wonderfully comforting, as
many staying behind have already
proved, for it is the most “personal’"
memento you. could wish to have.
Take records of his voice as used in conversation, and if he sings,
or plays any instrument, take records of that, too.
Fortunately with the Edison Phonograph a really life-like record
is possible —a record that is clear aaad true in every way.
The Edison is the ONLY talking machine upon which a SATIS-
FACTORY Record can be made at home. If your phonograph is
equipped with a Recorder all you need purchase for an experiment
is a blank record costing is. If you do not own a phonograph you
certainly should, and now would be an excellent time to purchase one.
Prices are within the reach of every purse, and range from £3 10s.
upwards —or from £8 10s. to £45 for Amberolas (concealed-horn
machines).
Call on your nearest Edison dealer and let him show you how simple
it is. If this is not possible write direct to us for full information.
Please state when writing if you own. a phonograph or not, and, if so,
what model.

corset. Lines of graceful propor-
tion result from moulding the figure
without discomfort, and Warner’s
famous Rustproof Models are un-
rivalled for every figure type.
Another advantage is that they will
not break or tear, and can be
washed, as all the boning and clasps
are absolutely rustless.
Obtainable at Leading Stores.

MELBOURNE CHATTER
Melbourne, October 4, 1915.
Mr Dear Yarrie, —
There was tweed and khaki in plenty at
Flemington on Saturday, but only a few
unexciting chiffons paraded the terrace and
spotted the grandstand. it was not
Fashion’s day out. Torn-up betting cards
and half a dozen shabby infants blew unin-
terruptedly across the lawn, and a little dust
was the only noticeable thing in the vice-
regal pen.
One missed the Richard Casey pair. The
big V.R.C. chairman is in a private hospital,
where he is taking notice after an operation.
Secretary Byron Moore’s missus, with daugh-
ter Linda, came early; likewise the William
Leonards. She, neatly tailored in blue, was
followed by son Charlie, convoying Clive’s
sister-in-law, Phyllis Reynolds, who was
garbed in many colors, with yellow kid-clad
legs and feet like a parrakeet. Quite a lot
ot misguided women-folk had fancy-dress
tootsies. The Reynolds girl was heavily
overshadowed by a scream in emerald-green
brocade, billowing fiercely over a regiment of
black silk frills, her cart-wheel headpiece
rearing itself frantically at an acute angle
over one ear. The biggest patch of lime-
light fell on two exceedingly pretty young
women, exquisitely upholstered in inky black,
and overweighted with pearl powder and
glace-silk flounces. One had her head half
hidden by a hat like a college trencher run
mad. The other had draped an entire black
lace curtain round an unduly wide-brimmed
tile.
Medical Captain Arthur Morris, who is
healing sick kangaroos at Langwarren, -
turned out in uniform with Mrs. Arthur.
Other uniforms were conspicuous—among
them, the Maoris’ loose khaki trousers which
gave the people inside an air of distinctive
importance.
Norman Faulkner’s Irish wife (he married
a cousin, my dear) was a symphony in nar-
row blue-and-white stripes. She wears a
worried look, having two Britisli-officer
brothers in the trenches.
Herbert Power, in the stewards’ box,
seemed to shut his eyes and trust to luck
whilst his good thing, Burrabadeen, was
winning all the way ; but daughters Nora and
Meta glued their eyes to the nag from start
to finish, grinning appreciatively at their
dear old dad, whom they insist upon address-
ing as Herbert, when his nag romped home.
The G.-G. came back from Broken Hill
and spent the day in the bath. At the usual
Town Hall reception his Ex., having heard
what the Barrier can do in the way of dust,
poured out thanksgiving for the glorious
spring weather he had come into. But he
reckoned without the local Trades Hall. He
had given out that he came “privately,” and
was the guest of general-manager Delprat,
of the B. H. Prop. That set the omnipotent
Trades Hall’s teeth on edge. Before the
reception was over one of the best of dust-
storms was sent along, and his Ex. lived in
it; for the next couple of days. The Trades
Hall does these little things so that visitors
may see whether the miner isn’t entitled to
another shilling a day. There are times
when he would be entitled to another shilling
a day even if he was making as much as a
Yankee munitions manufacturer.
We are to have Mrs. Hennessy as Mayoress
for another year, the genial David having
agreed to wear the rabbit-skins of a blameless
life for 12 months more. This will be David
Valentine’s fourth successive term, which
will constitute a record, no previous citizen
having been able to bear up under the strain
for more than three years at a stretch.
“Rosna,” writing from London, tells me
that Cecil Madigan, the fine, big Adelaide
’Varsity boy who went South Poleing with
Douglas Mawson, rushed over the other day
from France, where he has a commission
to annoy thp Kaiser, and put himself at the
beck and call of General Hymen. The bride
is a nice Australian girl, Wynnis, daughter
of the T. C. Wollastons, of Glenelg (S.A.).
She and her mother arrived via Marseilles
.lust in time for the engagement, which was
fought at Christchurch, Westminster.
Reggie Power has a commission in the
Middlesex Hussars, and by now is probably
actively disagreeable towards the Germhun.
Mrs. Reggie is assisting at a Cold Country
hospital, of which the handsome dame who
was the wife of our very own baronet before
she became Lady Grey-Egerton is angel-in-
chief.
Later advices show that Keith Borthwick,
son of Colonel Borthwick, of Ax*madale, who
was listed as missing after the fighting of
August 7, has been killed. He wms a
student at Dookie Agricultural College be-
fore putting on khaki. Another Borthwick
boy is at Gallipoli, and yet another met his
death in the Boer war. The family has a
soldiering record that gdl*s back to the
darker ages—if there really were any.
Two well-known Scotch families have been
united by the marriage of George Ogilvie,
of Merioola, in the big-stock raising district
of Mansfield, and Evelyn McWhae, infant
of the John McWhae family. Old man
John Ogilvie, a captain of the mercantile
marine, has for years been a member of the
Victorian Marine Board, and long ago
dropped his anchor for good in a secluded
corner of Toorak. Sharebroker John
McWhae has a first-class sleeping berth in
the House of Rich Landlords, and the
shower of confetti won’t disturb his slum-
bers.
A cable came the other day from Erica
Hughes, elder daughter of the Light Horse
Brigadier, who went to London with cousin
Vera Clarke-Landale to nurse wounded sol-
diers. The urgent news was that she had
got married to a naval officer of the name
of Jackson who had wooed and won her
during the journey to England.
Gordon Chirnside, who presented himself
and car to the First Expeditionary Force,
is ill at Malta, and his mother (now Mrs.
Ilodges) is—like a thousand other mothers
—“anxiously waiting for news.”
The stork made another mistake last week
when it dropped a girl-baby at the Norman
Brookes’s house, which already possessed
two small daughters. Mrs. Norman is
going to take a trip to Egypt presently to
introduce the third Miss Brookes to her
dad, now busy with Red Cross organising.
The Repertory camp-followers and the
numerous friends of Mr. Jo Smith swarmed
into St. Kilda Town Hall the other Wednes-
day night to witness the opening attack on
“Before the Dawn.” They came early and
they stayed late —too late for some of them.
The last cars for town must have been roll-
ing home when the author was returning
thanks to all concerned. “Before the
Dawn” is just a little machine-made
“comedy” which Jo Smith has contributed
to the Wounded Soldiers’ Fund. The
profits of this performance, and of all repe-
titions thereof, will be exchanged for
bandages, etc., and each repetition in turn
can be warranted to improve on the one
before.
"Before the Dawn” was staged more care-
fully than ordinary amateur performances in
town halls, and it never went three minutes
without getting a laugh or other noise of
approval from the friends of one or other
performer. All the nine members of
the co. had a fair share of small talk to
speak. Five of them were positively con-
cerned in the plot, which was as exciting
as two grains of red pepper in a spoonful
of water-gruel. Each melodramatic grain
was shaken out of a Gilbertian box to a
slow musical accompaniment, kindly sup-
plied by the Zingari Orchestra.
It seeixis like a year ago that Dorothy
Meyer’s former husband was reported dead.
He writes now to say that he has no recol-
lection of it. “I have been in the Army
ever since the trouble started,” he says, “and
I am now adjutant of a German officers’
prisoner-of-war camp. I have many pleasant
recollections of my visit to Australia as
manager of the Oscar Asches, and sincerely
hope, Huns permitting, some day to visit
again the sunniest land in all the world.”
Clever Maggie Dickinson, who up to now,
save for a couple of appearances in minor
parts, has sung to us only with her feet, is
shortly to be given her first chance in a big
part, as leading lady in “The Dancing
Mistress.”
The busy little Hyams sisters are round-
ing up pupils and friends for a plain and
fancy ball at St. Kilda Town Hall. The
ball is to bounce on the 27th in aid of the
Soldiers’ Rest Home, and the Hyams have
given it a title —“A Night in Egypt.”
That dandy veteran, Henry Bracy, who
was lately sick in Sydney, has practically
recovered his interrupted youth by a trip to
Maffra, where the beet-sugar grows. The
other night daughter-in-law Mrs. Phil
escorted him to the local hall to hear Irma
Caron and her little concert co. Afterwards
he bubbled over in praise of Leon Caron’s
dainty young daughter—said she had im-
proved out of all knowledge since two years
ago, when her voice was not half its present
size. He talks of running up to Melbourne
to take a hand in the production of his very
early friend, “The Old Guard,” at Her
Majesty’s.
Hugh V. McKay, the Harvester man, is
now rolling up his sleeves and getting ready
to tackle the ammunition-making job. It
isn’t the first time the works have hustled in
this war. Foremen speak proudly of 250
motor-waggons created in a brief fortnight
for the transport column, and the string of
ambulance-waggons that followed. And then
there were half a million horse-shoes.
There are 27 acres covered by machinery
works at Sunshine. One section is devoted
solely to munition-making, and the machin-
ery there, delicate as a breath and super-
humanly clever, can almost talk. Some of
the things are like toys. There is, for in-
stance, a complete petrol pump which fits in
the hollow of your hand like a watch. The
visitor, seeing these marvels treads gingerly
as if visiting a hobby-house of brittle orchids.
Ever seen a steel machine bite cold steel?
It is cannibalism of a sort, and gives you the
shivers, but the fireworks are beautiful.
Ammunition is not a new craze with the
•Sunshine man. Twelve years ago an Adel-
aide paper reported a speech of his in which
lie advocated the co-ordination of Australian
factories for the supply of war material.
His idea was that various big works should
each specialise on a part of the necessary
equipment and then co-operate when the
urgent need arose. Of course, nothing was
done.
Hugh V. has a nephew at the Front in
France —Victor, son of his journalist bro-
ther, N. V. McKay. This boy has a brother
training in England and another training in
Australia. Hugh V. says regretfully: “My
boy would have been of fighting age—he died
last year of appendicitis.” A younger son is
a college lad of 14. This one spends his
school holidays in dad’s foundries, working
for experience— and pocket-money. There
are eight brothers of the grown-up McKay
family and a goodly number of sons spring-
ing from each branch, and they take mostly
to machinery. Sunshine, where eight years
ago there was only one habitable house, now
has 5000 residents and a technical school con-
trolled by the Government. Girls are creep-
ing into the classes, which had a vacation
finish-up a week or two back.
From the Adelaide Front: —
A thoroughly unpleasant Spring clay, with a hot
wind and dust, coincided with the Hunt Club Races
on Saturday, but woman turned up in greater force
than at other meetings this year. Lady Galway
came with the Governor, Miss Macaulay, Captain
Brown and Mr. Legh Winser; and the W. Popes,
Mrs. Nat Campbell, one of the Kyffin Thomases and
a racing man or two watched events from the vice-
regal box. Dressing- was a weird medley of this
winter, last summer and the latest shriek. There
was a vast amount of navy blue and a good deal of
black and white.
The demands of the Defence Department had trans-
ferred the meeting from Morphettville to Victoria
Park, and for tea a good many people wandered
across the road to the John Roaches’ garden, where
half a dozen small children were holding a Red
Cross fete.
Thanks to the never-failing generosity of R. Ban-
Smith, the Kindergarten Union has become the
possessor of premises of its own—in an excellent
position in North Adelaide. The same cheque-book
has made it possible for the Girls’ Friendly Society
to buy a permanent lodge and hostel, which were
declared open by Bishop Thomas on Friday after-
noon. ■
Father Le Maitre, the Belgian priest who has been
a good deal before" the public as a speaker since the
war broke out, has at last .got the permission he has
wanted, and is to go to the Front as chaplain to the
Australian forces. An ex-soldier himself, and popu-
lar with men, he should fit the job, and he has a
useful knowledge of modern languages.
At the annual meeting of the South Aus. Justices’
Association a word or two of welcome were said to
the newly-appointed women justices, three of whom
—Mrs. Nicholls, Mrs. Cullen and Miss Dixon —were
present. The fourth—who, by the way, is the widow
of the late “Tom” Price —was only absent because
she is away from the State. The Labor Conference
has now passed a resolution demanding the removal
of the bar to women as M’s.P.; so the next elec-
tions may provide a thrill.
The Governor put in the early part of the week
at Laura, where he opened the local show, received
an address or two, and inspected the Beetaloo Water-
works. Lady Galway had the annual meeting of the
Babies’ Hospital on Thursday, and a fete for the
same Association at Government House on Satur-
day. This fete was well arranged and well attended,
and the stalls sold things people really wanted to
buy.
Mayor Simpson has received a vast petition beg-
ging him to continue in office for a third year, and
he has shyly whispered Yes.
Mrs. Giles, the widow of the late Mr. Thomas
Giles, died at North Adelaide on Friday. The
daughter of Capt. W. L. O’Halloran, who was for
some years Auditor-General of the State, she belongs
to a family which has dug deep into South Aus.
The Kingston Memorial is in sight. Its home in
Victoria Square is ready, and so is the pedestal for
the statue which is to come from England fairly
soon.
Vida Goldstein, after pouring out the vials
or her wrath at a Peace-at-any-Priee meet-
ing, remarked that some people might call
her “pro-German.” Goldstein German?
Whoever would think of such a thing, even
though the owner happens to be a
humorless lady who is so proud of “sticking
to her principles” that she apparently
wouldn’t oppose Germany? For that reason
it also seems unreasonable to suspect that
she is a Belgian woman.
The wedding of Kitty Boyes, the hand-
some sister of Mrs. Ted Dyson, is fixed for
the end of this week. The orange blossoms
had been ordered for September 28, but a
postponement was decided on to permit of
the attendance of the bridegroom. He is
Captain Jackson, of the Naval Reserve, with
whose arrangements these days the Navy-
office people are apt to play ducks and
drakes.
I rushed the Westralian musician Ivy
Wigmore to her wedding before the break-
fast was ready. So far she is merely en-
gaged to her Lieut. Frank Wharton, who’s
in London. I hope they didn’t mind.
When the “Soldiers’ Tent”- —which isn’t
a tent at all, but an entertainment hall with
billiard tables and a piano—was established
in the shadow of St. Paul’s Cathedral, some
frivolous minxes made themselves very much
at home, and there were Goings On which
arc still the talk of suburban afternoon-tea
parties. The consequence was that feminine
visitors are now very strictly sub-edited.
So much so that when one attractive Haw-
thorn girl who had given a gramophone was
invited to attend and provide a musical
demonstration, she naturally observed, “So
they think I’m a frump, do they?” One
day in waltzed a private with his cap—and
himself —on his ear, and, approaching the
acting hostess, hiccuped a request for a cijp
of coffee. Having drunk it, he asked if
she was fond of music, and in return for
her hospitality sat down to the piano and
sang and played operatic selections with
wizardry. Dismissing his last theme —a
selection from “Martha” —with a crashing
chord, he stood up and confided to the arch-
deaconess : “Yes, I've appeared at Covent
Garden —and now I’m going out as a blanky
private!” She kept enough breath to hope
that he would be there to join in the chorus
when the Brown Brigade marched through
Constantinople.
Before Will Dyson’s drawings were
passed on to their Sydney exhibition the
National Gallery people bought two —“Her
Place in the Sun” and “A Controller of
Traffic,” both excellent specimens of Bill's
work.
Barrister Willie Ah Ivet has received news
that the Chia 110 order has been conferred
on him by the President of the Chinese Re-
public. Please do not ask me what Ho,
because I don’t know; but the dapper Willie
seems very pleased about it.
A commission in the Royal Field Artillery
has been acquired by Alan Currie.
Ernest Robson —he used to be vice-warden
of our Trinity College—is acting as honorary
director of recreations at llarefield Park,
where so many of our boys are being repaired.
A girl friend in England Writes of a con-
cert given to 50 of the Australian and Maori-
land wounded by Ivirkby Lunn. She had
them down to her country house—“a perfect
dream of a place”—at Chorley Woods, and
got together for their entertainment a lirst-
class company, including our own pianist
William Murdoch.
Edgar Burton, son of coachbuilder Burton,
of the Melbourne City Council, was given
into the custody of Miss Alma Dalton, at St.
John’s Church, Latrobe-street, one evening-
last week. Subsequently they adjourned to
the Masonic Hall, where a large congrega-
tion of good feeders wished them luck and
fell on the food. The proceedings, directed
by Gaud Mayor Hennessy and glorified by
the presence of the new wife of ex-Mayor
Weedon, were remarkable for the frenzied
hurling of haloes at the civic celebrities pre-
sent. Hennessy was practically canonised.
Captain Leonard Wright, who belonged
to a brainy Oakleigh family and had been a
medical officer at the Melbourne Base Hos-
pital from the day of its opening, is dead of
meningitis—the second doctor in the Forces
to go under since the cruel epidemic started.
Wright was only lately out of Melbourne
Uni. In tire fifth year of his course he was
laid out with a complaint which kept him
at St. Vincent’s Hospital for months; but
he hung on to his books, and the TJni. people'
let him do his final papers in the hospital.
Alfred, an elder brother, once on the land in
Fiji, is doing medicine on tiie profits of his
South Sea enterprise; and a sister is an
expert in surgical instruments, having been
to England to perfect her knowledge in that
direction. The dead Wright was only 23.
Mrs. John Sanderson has arranged four
high-toned musical parties for Lady Stan-
ley’s appeal for the war-worn. These orgies
take place on October 19 and 25 and Novem-
ber 3 and 10 at the Sanderson home in
Toorak. Walter Kirby will tenor.
May Brookes, sister of tennis champion
Norman, is off to Cairo. She takes with!
her clever Nellie Billings, the girl who plays
so artistically on the piano’s white teeth.
Maisie herself is the owner of a robust
soprano voice. (You’ve guessed it! Con-
certs for the soldiers, of course.)
Archie Michaelis, who is a gunner, has
cabled home from Egypt to say that lie is
going back to his war-job after a holiday in
hospital. This Honorable Artilleryman is a
member of the Russo-Australian firm of
Michaelis-llallenstein, which for many years
has successfully tried to show Australia
that there’s nothing like leather. The firm
has numerous brothers, sons, nephews and
cousins belting- the Hun in France.
Rupert Atkinson’s share of his father’s
fortune (most of it was dug out of Ben-
digo) pans out at £33,000 —enough to sup-
ply the frugal needs of any Australian
paper-singer for the remainder of his days.
Atkinson has published a couple of unpre-
tentious volumes in which occasional
flashes of the divine fire have been dis-
covered by diligent critics, and whole dozens
of copies have been sold.
Ex-Cliief Justice Parker, of Westralia, is
coming east to be refreshed by some of the
whistling southerly busters that punctuate
our summer. A bodyguard of four unmarried
daughters will accompany him. Married
daughter Mrs. Craven has undertaken to
look after the little home in the West.
The late Donald (“Carbine”) Wallace’s
property at Balian, which was for years in
the possession of only son Jack, has been
acquired by the Jack Molesworths, who in-
tend to turn the old place into a modern
home before they move from St. Kilda.
The Robert Harpers, with the dread of
summer in their hearts, have fled from.
South Yarra, where they have a nice, cool
home, to Macedon, where bush fires are fre-
quent. Only the well-to-do can afford to
dodge the calendar like this ; the poor have
to stand their ground and tell the thermo-
meter to come on.
The Block lost some of its radiance when
Bob Cain put away his glorious haber-
dashery and got into khaki. I believe that
when the dreadful news went round, a tailor
drifted into a monastery and a mercer blew
out his brains in front of the new season’s
styles.
Mrs. Edmund Playfair, of Sydney, has
come down to Melbourne to meet her son
Captain Jack, who has just been returned
damaged from the Front. I hear that,
though much scarred, he is bursting to be
off again to carve the Turk.
Knitting competitions are now the rage
among the sister Susies, and the girl who can
knit the largest area of sock in a given time
is liable to win anything from a pair of
gloves to a diamond brooch, according to the
social and financial stature of her hostess.
Mrs. Malcolm Marsh is arranging a knitting
contest at the Repertory Club, in which the
judges will be male singers, who in their turn
will be exoeeted to submit their warbles to a
vote of the knitters. What heartburnings are
in store for them !
Yours sincerely,
JOHANNA.

In reply to a circular letter from a mail
order firm Henare explains why no orders have come
to hand from him of late:—
Korohe, August 2tli, 8/1915.
Mr Mcdougall Bros
Dear Sir, —I am just senting and order to you for
long time so Dear I not leaving you for this
long time only what keep me senting order to this
last time you haven’t got everythings I wont. In
your catalogue also, wires, and staples and tins
Milks wire neting for fanceing so all the time I am
looking for good merchants to get me all these
things and Roofing iron. I couldn’t git any. That
is how I never senting order to you for all this long-
time Ive got a Baby. Feed with Milks most my
orders sent to Brown and Co. for some Milks for my
Baby and wire Fanceing but I couldn’t git wire to
much the charge for the carting from Waiowui to
Tokaanu so I am still got no wires. But I am sorry
for you all the time, 1 stick to you for ever for ail
the cheaps goods in your Catalogue and free Fraight
to
From Your faithfully, Henare Tf.kaita.
WOULDN’T THINK OF DOING IT.
“Are yous the bloke root said I pinched, yer blanky dory?”
“ N-no! I only said that wen you went the dog went.”
“Outcast”: Referring to Robert McNab's
searching for the records of the landing of the
Frenchman Du Fresno in Macriland there have been
many hunts for the tracks of the old Spaniards and
other early explorers of the Pacific Islands. De
Quiros left a record in some old MSS. that he landed
oft' an island in Orangerie Bay (Papua). I remem-
ber that A. M. Campbell, when R.M. at Samarai, put
in some hard toil climbing over the island and doing
a lot of digging in the hope of finding an anchoring-
post or some such trace, but without any luck.
Woodford, Resident of the Solomons, secured some
small metal articles from a site on Vanikoro which
the nigs, pointed oiit as that on which La Perouse
and his surviving companions lived after the mysteri-
ous wrecks of the exploring ships Astrolabe and
Boussole. Woodford also made a -search for the
cairn which D’Entrecasteaux put up in memory of
La Perouse, but he found only some stones of the
foundation buried in the mangrove mud.
“Te Whare”: For cussedness, combative-
ncss and cast-iron check commend me to the green
eel, common on the Australian coast and abhorred
of rock fishermen, whose lines it tangles into in-
extricable knots. It will often emerge mysteriously
from some cranny in the rocks while fish are being
cleaned at the water-edge and seize on the offal or
uuythi ng in the way of flesh —which on one occasion
took the shape of the writer’s little finger. The
needle-like teeth cut like lancets, and the gory
finger had to be dragged out of the jaws by main
force. In another instance, while a green eel which
had been hooked was being hauled into a boat, another
grabbed it by the tail, and the two were landed.
Banged violently on a rock after it is caught a
green eel will lose consciousness for a time, but soon
recovers. One treated in this fashion, and which
had the hook taken out of its mouth while stupefied,
on recovering its senses seized a fish in its jaws and
disappeared in the water beneath. Although the
narrow, coffin-shaped head of this eel, its glassy
blue eye and serpentine form generally set one
against it the creature is edible, and its bite (unlike
that of the sea-snake) is not poisonous.
*• * * *
“Eryander”: I can’t solve “Leo Lear’s”
eel-problem (B. 9/9/T5), but here, for what it is
worth, is personal knowledge. One of the biggest
European eel-fisheries is on the Irish river Erne,
where immense quantities of the fish are taken in
weir-nets as they are making down for the sea in
winter. In early summer the elvers make their
appearance from the Atlantic. Pale green in color
and about the length and thickness of a large darn-
ing-needle, they congregate in enormous numbers at
a point where they are blocked by the Ballyshannon
falls. Here they are bucketed in millions and con-
veyed to the river above, by which they make their
way to Lough Erne, whence, after one, two or three
seasons, they make for saltwater again, ranging then
■ —according to the length of their stay in the lake —
from two to five feet in length. They run only at
night; the darker and stormier the better. Calm
weather doesn’t suit them, and moonlight stops them
altogether. So much for the typical eel Anguilla vul-
garis. I can’t answer for the other sorts.
A QUESTION OF DEGREE.
McPHERSON: "McTavish, ye're drunk, ye are.”
McTAVISH : "I’m not drunk, McPherson—I’m sober.”
McPHERSON: “Eh, mon, then let us have anither drink!”
McTAVISH (his shout): “Nae, McPherson, ye were right — I’m drunk.”
“(Ins Gosh”: There is no warning smell
about an approaching cyclone, and many a good
ship has been caught unawares. But the murderous
willy-willy of the Westralian nor’-west coast will
have to be slicker now than formerly if it wants to
count on getting the old-time crop of victims.
Most of the sea-going vessels and pearling luggers
in the danger zone are being supplied with aneroids
and register books. Warnings are being issued by
the Federal Meteorological Department, and will pro-
bably reach the skippers before the willy has finished
climbing the slope three horizons away. Special
cards of advice to navigators on how to manoeuvre
during a storm are also being supplied, so when the
Spring Heeled blowhard happens on an unsuspecting
vessel he will have to devise new methods of attack.

“Star” : lie the recent cremation of a
well-to-do Sikh at the- Western N.S.W. township of
Mculamein (B. 9/9/’l5). The whole neighborhood
turned out to witness the scene and incidentally
sample the whisky provided by the corpse’s friends.
The coffin was placed on a huge pile of dry timber,
neatly stacked, and then the defunct brother was
liberally anointed with scent, whisky, and lastly
butter (at 2s. a lb. 1). Bark and dried leaves were
then piled over the coffin, the whole structure satu-
rated with kerosene, and fire-sticks applied. The
amount of firewood required for the job was the
thing that hit the Caucasian hardest —it was enor-
mous. When the job was thoroughly done the ashes
were carefully raked over, and some of them taken
to send to India to be dropped into the sacred
Ganges.

“Ecklyson”: It was a hot day. For five
long, boiling hours the old man and I had been
surging and swaying over a bush road in our covered
waggon behind two dust-laden horses hid in a mist of
flies, when we came to Bray's Half-way House, at
’Stone Crossing. Bray’s Half-way House was built of
bark and shingles, and leaned against two dispirited
white gums. It was called the Half-way House
because it was just half-way to nowhere. When we
arrived three men were rolling in the dust, fighting
a weak, foolish kind of battle —a battle which, to all
appearances, had been going on for a very long time,
blood having dried on the combatants. All three
were afflicted with great fatigue. A fourth man
leaned upon Bray’s ricketty verandah post, an empty
bottle at his feet, and smoked a short clay with the
air of one for whom life held no further interest.
“Hello!” said the old man. “What’s wrong here?”
“They’re'-fightin’ over a bottle iv beer,” said the
weary fragment on the post. “Go on!” said the old
man. “Where’s the beer?” The leaner fitted the
post to the small of his back. “I've drunk it,” he
said.
“S.S.S.” : Papua is the last lap in debil-
debil. One night in Moresby I was waked by a
weird and soul-scaring- cry that came at intervals
of lOsec, or so from a twisted tree above the native
hospital. I went out and called the night-orderly
(officially known as “Night-walkabout”). Down the
hill he came with his swinging lamp looking like a
giant firefly. - “What name that singout ?” I asked.
“That one 00-00 bird,” he told me cheerfully. “Him
talk sun come up, one old man dead.” “But,” I
reminded him, “no man along hospital has got a big-
sick.” “Him talk,” said Rhei-masi, conclusively. 1
retired again. At sunrise a team of boys went down
to the dead-house bearing a poor Thing- slung like a
pig on a pole. They were airsick of a dread tropi-
cal disease, and one, an old man, had died as they
carried him in from a plantation. The Motu natives
can tell whether the bird of ill-omen is “calling” a
child or man or woman, and whether the victim is
to be white or colored. The 00-00 appears to be a
sort of screech-owl, though, according to pourri-
pourri lore, it is merely a “medium.” The trees
from which it calls are taboo, and no native would
knowingly pass under one.
“Billy T.” : lie was a commercial traveller
with an Arkansaw .accent, and he was having great
trouble with the motor-car he had hired to carry
his samples over Ben’s Elbow to Pieball. The car
had settled down for a quiet afternoon, sunning
itself in the soft glow of a spring day, and the man
from U.S.A. was all over it, like a monkey over a
crate of bananas. He came out for a tool, and
dived under. He emerged again, and tried her once
more, and cursed, and dived and emerged, and
screwed, and sweated, and swore. For the 109th
time Hiram emerged. He tried her again. She still
resisted. “Well, I’m -—— !” said Hiram
to the extent of five lines. Then he drew a revolver
from his hip-pocket, fired five shots into the car, and
went his way.

“Casual”: In our part quandong is not
wild cherry. Quandong, or native peach, has the
nut very much on the inside of the fruit, whilst
wild cherry (Exocarpus cupressiformis ), as the
scientific name suggests, has the nut on the outside,
i.e., on top of the fruit. These vegetables, although
of the same natural order (Fantalaciae or sandal-
wood family), are not of the same genus. Naturalists
should come and see Nature now and then. One of
them some time back spoke of black duck carrying
their young ones from tree to water per medium of
the beak. There is a more comfortable way, viz.,
between the thighs, which Mr. and Mrs. Duck have
adopted.

FIGHTING MEN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
They took old Jimbill into camp
To teach him how to fight;
The chokin’ fogs rose dense and damp
On many a cheerless night;
He had no coat or rainproof sheet
Till someone kicked, and then
Some colonel shaky on his feet
Said “These are fighting men!
This isn’t a young ladies’ school!
'We’re making fighting men!”
Some mates of Jimbill’s reached the war,
And some got half-way round,
'When ratlike pains began to gnaw
The limbs that once were sound ;
As twisted wrecks they crept to bed
’Where Egypt bakes, and when
They heard of distant fights they said,
“Oh, yes, we’re fighting men!
They made us sleep out in the wet,
So now we’re fighting men !”
And Jimbill? Jimbill’s grave is green!
A mulga bushinan, he
On many a winter trip had been
And come through easily.
But some fool tricks he’d never tried —
Like sleeping in a fen ;
Of these experiments he died
When with the fighting men.
(Some died and some just crept to bed;
But all were fighting men !)

The Drinks that Draw the Crowds.
Never was there a more propitious time for installing the famous “ICELESS” Interior.
The Season is almost here —when the craving for refreshing drinks proves a temptation too
stroll" to resist. The “Season” will not wait for you if you are not ready for it. That’s the
reason—why—you should investigate— at once. Do you seek proof of the supremacy of the
NELSON “ICELESS” FOUNTAIN?— you’ll find it in the fact that successful Drink
Suppliers throughout Australasia have made good through it and swear by it.
Let the experience of the multitude guide you—don’t think this universal adoption of the
Nelson “ICELESS” is a fad—it’s founded upon the business judgment of the keenest and
most conservative drink vendors in the country.
It’s the most reliable, efficient and economical plant you can find—strongly constructed of
the finest materials by Australian workmen in our own splendidly-equipped factory.
If you are interested, write at once and let us give you the benefit of our knowledge—we

Bringing the Life-tone from your Records
.. It utters every suggestion of that velvet
\ softness a singer mould rvislito used*
The great audience is hushed. Low, sweet, the singer’s
voice floats out, gently as a breath, softly as a dream .
If but—from an instrument —we could hear the utter tenderness of that singer’s tone!
But no record could ever “ take ” that. And never existed a tone-producer that could
graduate perfectly the strengthened tones forced upon the singer by record-taking necess-
ities — never “till the Vocalion came.”
The Aeolian-Vocalion is so truly wonderful because it rectifies records. It utters
every suggestion of that velvet softness a singer would wish to use—not by muffling tone
but by controlling it through the Graduola device—just as the human throat does at
its source.
Its wonderful Symphonetic Horn preserves, too, more than mere tonal beauty— it
preserves the very character of every voice. The hard metallic tone has disappeared!
We urge you to try your own records on a wonderful Vocalion here without the
slightest obligation to yourself.

STOPS FALLING HAIR.
This Home-made Mixture Stops Dandruff
and Falling Hair and Aids Its Growth.
To a half-pint of water add :
Bay Rum loz.
Orlex Compound A small box.
Glycerine loz.
These are all simple ingredients that you
can buy from any chemist at very little cost,
and mix them yourself. Apply to the scalp
once a day for two weeks, then once every
other week until all the mixture is used. A
half-pint should be enough to rid the head of
dandruff and kill the dandruff germs. It
stops the hair from falling out, and relieves
itching and scalp diseases.
Although it is not a dye it acts upon the
hair roots and will darken streaked, faded
grey hair in 10 or 15 days. It promotes the
growth of the hair, and makes harsh hair soft
and glossy. [2

“Aneb”: If “Lou’s” horsebreaker was a
wonder (B. 2/9/’IS) he must have been the excep-
tion that disproves the rule. The enlightened breaker
never puts anything on a horse without the animal
first seeing it. To roll up a bag, tie it on the saddle,
and (when one is presumably astride the brute) let
it roll down gradually would make nearly every colt
kick from fright. No one but a man with mental
affliction would fasten anything on to a saddle that
might cause trouble. A loose bag in the hand will
do more good (has done it for generations past), and
it can be discarded at will. An ordinary horse-rug
put on a colt while he watches his first suit of
clothes being adjusted will go a long way to
quieten him; but don't forget to let him go in a
yard or you will witness the tin-on-a-dog’s-tail
act. Why, by the way, will writers continue to
sing the praises of Outback breakers? The cream of
them are brought “inside” to better their conditions
and finish their education. Billy Waite, than whom
we’ve never seen a better, when his education was
complete went to London with Cockram’s show.
Bert Fletcher, reckoned the- pride of the West, and
a good-’un, was travelling the cities with Skuthorpe ;
ditto, Combo George, who, though an abo., had few
equals in sneaking on to a colt’s back. Mrs. Aeneas
Gunn’s hero-breaker, the silent one of “We of the
Never Never,” can, or could till lately, be seen at
work in the backyard of John Hill and Co.’s stables
in Adelaide. This is the most humane way to cure a
ticklish colt. Tie him up securely, in a round yard
if possible. Take a 30ft. length of ordinary rope,
and put one end over his wither and under his
belly. Then stand back full length of rope, one end
in each hand, pull with left hand and give with the
right, and vice versa, rubbing the animal all over
from top of neck to end of hind legs. An expert can
clean a colt all over, barring his head, by this
means. Any colt will kick on the side he feels
the irritation, and that is the side opposite to you.
Can any Abo. writer give a better idea or one as
safe to man and horse?

Pitcairn Island, where the Bounty
mutineers settled after their little trouble with the
skipper, has for many, many years lain outside the
track of ships; but the Norman Monarch, which
put into Wellington (M.L.) the other day, called at
the lone piece of earth on her way across from New
York, and in return for some papers got a lot of
chickens and fresh cabbages and things. The very
much mixed population told the skipper that the
opening of the Panama Canal had proved a boon to
them, for steamers from the Eastern ports of
America call there frequently now and keep them
well supplied with news. They don’t seem to feel
the need of anything else.
* * * *
“Fiji”: “Mulga” (B. 5/8/T5) says
dingoes cannot be run down on horseback in tim-
bered country. I myself 36 years ago ran down and
killed with my stirrup-iron a dingo in low-timbered
hills on the Maclntyre, below Inverell (N.S.W.). I
know a better case still. An overseer riding in the
steep ranges on the head of the Manning (N.S.W.),
seeking a dingo that had been killing sheep, sighted
the dog and chased him at full speed down a steep,
timbered spur. Billjim was carrying a loaded rifle,
and at the bottom, after a descent from 4000 ft. to
2000 ft. i#i less than two miles, put a shot in where
it would do most good.
“C.-J.”: “Sassafras” (B. 2/9/T5) asks
why the lyre bird does not imitate the wonga or
turkey, and (he might have added) the “baldy”
pigeon. Old hands in the bush give as the reason
that those birds are ground feeders, and to imitate
them would call up dingoes and much ensuing
trouble. It seems reasonable.
EMPHATIC.
HIBERNLAN ATTENDANT : “Luk, my malm, if
yez want to shmoke here yes must put
out that cigar or go somewhere else."
“O. Griff”: I’ve got the settler of the
longest-root argument. It is in the Urewera coun-
try (M.L.), where I came across it while surveying.
It had’ its foundation near the edge of a small lake,
and reached to the extreme top of a precipice rising
almost perpendicularly above the water. I went to
no end of trouble to ascertain its exact length,
which proved to be 313 ft. Sin. The strangest part
is the fact that it thrives in the very poorest of
pumice country, and has no vegetable neighbors
within speaking distance.
VEXED ETHIC.
BILL : “I tell yeh there’s no difference —naked and rood’s all the same."
PAT : “And I tell yez ye’re all wrong. If yes stood up on a stump in the park like this
feller with nothin’ but a coat o’ whitewash an’ a grin, that ’ud be the Nude, an’
ye’d be High Art. But if yes took off yer singlet and trousers in Casey’s bar,
that ’ud be naked, an' ye’d be run in."
“Leo Lear”: Re stock-feed in droughts,
My experience is that starving stock will eat almost
anything. In the Riverina one pastoralist, instead
of sending his sheep to relief country per the loving
cruelties of the railways, cut down forests of young
red gums along the billabongs. This tough scran
pulled his jumbucks through for six months. Nor
were the trees eaten indiscriminately, as occasion-
ally one to all appearances similar to hundreds of
others would be passed over and left to rot. Per-
haps it smelt of Gerliogs, or Party Government, or
something equally strong. Sugar gums on the Vic-
torian Western Plains are seemingly as indigestible
as red-gums, but even they saved hundreds of sheep.
Vegetation regarded as a pest, and in other years
vigorously hunted down by shire inspectors, was
last summer and autumn hailed with open mouths.
Gorse hedges, blackberry, sweet-briar and other im-
ported curses were masticated, and as for Scotch
thistles they were the salvation of flocks and herds
unlimited. The dry beds of swamps grew tons of
these prickles to the acre, and wherever stock could
penetrate every seed-head was nipped off. I wonder
if any person’s starvers tackled Kangaroo Island
prickly acacia.
“Alamon”: Re the sea-serpent (B.
27/5/’ 15), I saw one once off the coast of China, 15
miles from land. It looked about eight feet long,
and was swimming a little below the surface. The
creature was yellowish in color, and did not appear
any different from the ordinary land-serpent, though
it passed us closely. A sailor with a brown-paper
face told me that the visitors are fairly common
off the China coast, but that two or three fathoms
are always tacked on to their length by unreliable
travellers. All travellers are unreliable —especially
commercial travellers.
“Pick”: While theorists like “Bilben” (B.
2/9/’l5) are explaining how fish come to be in iso-
lated pools will one of them explain the following?
In ’94 I witnessed a terrific downpour of rain, which,
from a thundercloud, fell along the high grounds
west of Windellama (N.S.W.). The deluge poured
from the hillsides and over the adjacent dry flats, and
left thousands of fish, in shape and size similar to
small fresh-water perch, in its track. Where did
they come from? I don’t want anyone to say the
floods carried them out of some watercourse, because
there was no watercourse handy—l’ll swear to that.
“Wanda”: Talking about aborigine mon-
archs, who was “Tom, King of Buckenbone” ? A
brass plate was picked up some years ago on the
banks of the Moruya River, a few miles above the
township, bearing that inscription. A local resi-
dent has it, but there’s not much more known about
it.
“Nap”: It happened while I was rabbit-
ing out Grenfell way (N.S.W.). Half a mile from
my camp was a nest of eagles—pa, ma and two
young ones —and they had fresh meat every day
from my traps. One morning, however, old man
eagle got caught himself. He flew with the trap,
about half a yard of dog chain and a heavy peg
into an ironbark, where the wood caught in a fork
and the thief was well and truly caged. He made a
terrible fuss, and I had to shoot him to prevent him
pulling the tree up by the roots.
“H.W.D.”: Can the Abo. gang dig out
anything to beat this for giants? Near Warwick
(Q.), of a family of seven who run a cow farm, dad,
who is now a bit bent, stands 6ft. 6in. ; mum, 6ft. ;
eldest son, 6ft. iin. ; youngest son, 6ft. 4in. ; eldest
daughter, 6ft. Sin. ; second daughter, 6ft. ; and the
baby 6ft. 2in. I measured them myself, so I know.
“Bad Australian” : Are there any flamin-
goes in Australia? I never dropped across them in
my wanderings there, but I have made up for it in
this country (South America), where they are to
be found in millions. I struck a hatchery once in
a big, shallow lake in Upper Peru, where nothing
could be seen for miles but lady flams sitting or
standing or straddled over their curious nests. These
nests are generally in a shallow lake or swamp, the
building materials being mud and any flotsam and
jetsam that comes handy. The nests are constructed
just high enough for the bird to walk on and sit
with her feet resting on the bottom in the shallow
water at either side. The eggs are of a dirty white
color, as big as a goose egg, and with that slightly
greenish tinge seen in the ordinary domestic duck
egg. When the chicks are hatched out they look like
large balls of thistledown, with hardly any trace
of the pinkish color which is characteristic of the
mature bird. The eggs are eatable in an omelette
or doped with Worcester sauce, but I never struck
a poisoner who could make the whites set by boiling.
Perhaps it might be managed at sea level—up here
it’s about 15,000 feet higher than that. Even our
spuds always persist in having a “bone” in them, in
spite of every effort on the part of the poisoner to
overcome the difficulty. At this altitude the cold
was so fierce in the month of August that I often
saw lady flams, frozen fast by the feet until 9.30 or
10 a.m. If there was no sun they remained frozen
in until my Indian boys tore them out by the roots.
I saw an item in Pearson's some time ago stating
that only two white men had ever seen flamingoes
on their nests. It is curious how these things will
leak out. But I wonder who the other fellow was.
*■* * W
“Sarto”: When handing out rewards for
merit to useful bush commodities one that deserves
more than passing attention is the common old bag.
About the house it has to be a verandah-blind (when
there is a verandah), a door-curtain (when there
isn’t a door), a hearthrug, doormat, ceiling, parti-
tion, and even a wall itself sometimes. It is slept
on and under —makes bunk and blanket —and there
are colder things than a “Wagga rug” on a winter’s
night. It makes a good knocking-about apron for
mum and the girls, and an overcoat (made by cut-
ting a hole in the middle and one in each corner of
the bottom of the bag for neck and arms) for dad
and the boys. A cheer here for the resourceful Aus-
tralian mother in the drought area whose children
I saw running about with nothing between them and
nakedness but a flourbag “cut” in the above style.
And as a feeder and a rug for Dobbin or Straw-
berry a .bag is just the ticket.
■* +• * *
“Yancy” : Talking about horse-breakers, I
remember being with Harry _ Dempsey when an
obstreperous brumby was performing. Said a by-
stander: “Could you stick to that, Harry?” “Stick!
Why, I could pluck fowls on him!'’
“Boronia” : In Westralia I know a piece
of country about 200 acres in extent, lying in a very
dense portion of the karri forests, which was swept
by a fire twice within three days. It had been ring-
barked for nearly 10 years before the flames raged
through, and as a result the ground was so thickly
littered with fallen trunks and limbs that everything
went to blazes again for a second time. If any Abo-
liar characterises the above as a profound lie he will
loudly bray his ignorance as to how thick a karri
forest can be when it feels that way. And it feels
that way very often.
EXTRAVAGANT SUICIDE.
RACHEL : “I see another man lias committed
suicide by jumping from a ferry-boat.'"
IKEY : “Vot extravagance! Vy couldn’t he
jump off the vorf an’ save the fare?"
“Chin Whiskers”: Re the virtues and
perils of lucerne. I had sheep on this fodder con-
tinuously last year and none got blown. I am now
running cows on it, wet and dry, and the only
result has been an increase in the milk yield. As
long as stock are not put on to it hungry they will
not be hurt. A neighboring farmer has grazed his
cows on lucerne for at least five years, and his losses
so far are nil.
FOR THE FRONT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
They wanted horsemen for the war,
And to the yard they came ;
Marks of the beast a- number bore,
And all of them were game ;
We watched them bobbing on the buck,
And some came off, and some had luck.
Oh, fierce and fiery was the roan,
Infernal was the bay!
By each of them a score were thrown,
A dozen by a grey.
Like hoppers in the Spring, I ween,
The boys were bouncing on the green.
Five bucks were dancing on the track
A sort of Turkey Trot.
“These nags,” said Henderson to Mac,
“Are certainly red hot.
They’ll play Old Harry with the foe—■
Who’ll kid the Turks to ride them, though?”

“L.T.A.”: “Copy Boy’s” reference (B.
23/9/’l5) to the “Passing Show” column
if Melbourne Argus raises in memory’s
leaves a mournful rustling. Years ago,
when D. H. Maling, Donald Macdonald, E.
r. Fric-ker (now editor of The Austral-
asian) and the late Davison (“Peter”)
Symmons were among the morning stars
that sang together on the Argus, they con-
spired to produce a bright little weekly
mlled Bohemia, which flourished until the
powers that were intervened on the ground
that its production interfered with the
originators’ steady jobs. By way of com-
pensation, the “Passing Show” column was
begun, its joint authorship being concealed
under the pen-name “Oriel,” suggested to
Peter Symmons by the oriel window in
front of the first floor of the Argus build-
ing. A later contributor was Johnny
Sandes, now leader-writing on Sydney
Daily Telegraph, and for a time he was
solely responsible for the column, although
his gentlemanly verses lacked the slickness
and flair which characterised the gospels of
Peter. Subsequently Monty Grover, now
editing Sydney Sun, smote his versatile
lyre in the column, although Argus tradi-
tions somewhat hampered his pen. Then
the work was divided among a trio—
Grover, A. C. McCay (now of Sydney Sun,
and mournfully regarded by those who know
him best as a lost poet, for in him was the
true spirit of the lyric Apollo) and Guy
Innes, at present news-editing Melbourne
Herald. These three, with the aid of the
late George McLeod Redmond, formed a
poets’ corner in the commercial sense, and
secured an increase in the market price of
their products. Del. McCay (also now
of Sydney Sun), other members of
the staff and an occasional outsider con-
tributed as the spirit moved. Later, again,
came Howard Ashton, who was not above
dropping the brush for the pen. The most
distinctive work of recent months is that
of Franklin Peterson, son of the late Prof.
Peterson and editor of the Melba Gift
Book. He is a Judge’s associate, and if his
knowledge of law equals his skill in verse
he will eventually become Chief Justice. The
Sandes anil Symmons verses have been put
into book form—those of Symmons by his
friends; after he was dead ; those of Sandes
by likpseU" after most of the verse was dead.
Samlesjs greatest hit was the Boer War
versfe g)|pth Death’s Prophetic Ear,” best
remembered by its refrain of “the rooi-
baatjes singing on the road.” But some of
Symmons’s lyrics, dashed off in hairline
script at the last minute, narrowly escaped
being literature. A skit by Sandes on the
late P. Iv. McCaughan, owner of the Mel-
bourne Rialto, involved the Argus in a libel
suit, and, if I remember rightly, Is. dam-
ages. But the resultant evidence was worth
pounds to the paper, and made the modest
Johnny temporarily more famous than
Tennyson.

“Dalraada”: Well, my impression of Aus-
tralia’s war correspondent Bean is that,
despite his red hair, he does not fuse easily,
even under pressure. When another man—
Randolph Bedford, say—would be forging
thunderbolts, Bean is eternally watchmaking
.under fire. One of his articles was as pre-
cise a specimen of journalistic horology as
I have ever #een. It was that formal diary,
written under fire and timed by a stop-
watch, (if-, the development of a trench
attack. "Each paragraph began “3.45,”
“3.50.” “3.57,” and so on—and there wasn’t
a thrill in a column of it. It ended with the
writer’s detached and impersonal statement
that owing to his having been wounded he
would have to leave until later the verifica-
tion of certain details. Such a man could
do algebra while Rome was burning. When
the Australians charged at Krithia, Bean,
according to London Weekly Despatch,
sat in a dug-out in the firing line with the
officers of the general staff. He was
equipped with a periscope and a typewriter,
and when he had rattled off his copy he
awoke to the fact that he was the only one
of the eight or nine occupants of the dug-
out who was not wounded. His oblivion to
personal danger greatly impressed Ashmead
Bartlett and others. But. despite his slick-
ness in getting the news, Bean pants bravely
along the track with a millstone about his
neck and a padlock on his soul.
They are still discussing Ned Kelly’s
armor in London. Dramatist G. R. Sims
says he “wore an iron saucepan for a hel-
met, with a big Dutch oven for a breastplate.
The handle of the saucepan stuck out at
the back of his head like an alarmed pig-
tail.” Sims has probably been misled into
this weird story by memories of one or other
of the half-dozen alleged “lives” of Ned —-
lurid productions with an abundance of
embroidery around some scraps of historic
fact—that still find many readers among
young Cockneys. One of them, called “Ned
Kelly, the Ironclad Bushranger of Aus-
tralia,” has had an enormous circulation,
and continues to sell steadily all the year
round.

“Copy Boy” : As a speaker Kink O’Malley
receives less than justice from the dailies.
While space is always found for any
remarks of his anent gilt-spurred roosters
and Pawnee maidens, many comparatively
good things never see print. In a more or
less hifalutin manner the Kink is frequently
both picturesque and epigrammatic, especi-
ally when heckled. Here are a few O’Mal-
leyisms, nearly all called forth by interjec-
tions, during a recent finance debate in the
House of Reps.:—
What is system but crystallised uncommon sense?
The scheme of no man is accepted until he is
dead —and then it is regarded as a new scheme.
Experience is the germ of knowledge, and know-
ledge is the science of power.
If my friend the Minister for the Navy makes
suggestions he will be as unpopular as I became.
What is life ? Real life is labor, laughter and
love.
The three great systems of the world are the
Roman Catholic Church, the Standard Oil Company
and the German Empire.
The Kink’s trouble really is that he doesn’t
know when to leave off being a Yankee-Aus-
tralian Bernard Pshaw. It was this that
killed him stone-dead as an administrator.
* * * *
“H. 0.”: Novelist Henry James (not to
be confused with Henry James James,
who married Babette and took a verbatim
report of her nightdress) has dissociated him-
self from the star-spangled dove by becoming
a naturalised John Bull. He gives as his
reason liis desire to throw his “moral weight
and personal allegiance, for whatever they
may be worth, into the scale of the con-
tending nation’s present and future fortune."’
“Peter”: Certain pressmen’s abuse of
privileges granted by the courtesy of the
Federal Parliament has given “Gallio” (B.
16/9/’l5) an unsubstantial grievance to
relate. If he was warned off the elevator,
as his par. suggests, he was probably also
barred from the gardens and the library
simply because one or two bumptious
reporters seem to regard these adjuncts of
the House as their own private property.
When members discover, say, the tennis
court in the gardens and favored nooks in
the library continually covered with a rash
on apparently unemployed scribes, the poli-
ticians are hound to kick as hard as the
regulations allow. It is a saddening cir-
cumstance if their kick should land on the
dignity of “Gallio,” hut he should not blame
the Joint House Committee for it. He
should pour the vials of his annoyance on
the fourth estate, and urge sundry members
thereof to bring their manners up to the
alleged level of their morals.
“Scrip”: Melbourne men of the Stock
Exchange district stared when they read in
their Bulletin that Carew Reynell, of
Adelaide, was lately killed in action. The
soldier may have lived and died Carew Rey-
nell, but he couldn’t have been the Carew
Reynell any more than another person
named Shakspeare can be Divine William.
They knew but one Carew Reynell, and he
died two or three years ago. He was boss
of the S. M. Herald’s little den in Collins-
street, and was greatly revered thereabouts
owing to his commanding voice and manner
and his invariable belltopper. Melbourne
remembers him as the most important
man who ever passed an opinion. He
amounted to It. When he dealt with
a public question he did deal with
it. He just knocked it out, as you may
say. And he was a staunch British imperi-
alist, mind you. He’d have put a stop to
the Kaiser’s nonsense. Said a Melbourne
stockbroker the other dav: “Ah. we’d have
won this war long ago if Carew Reynell
had been alive !”
* * *
“Quill”: Australian metropolitan dailies
refer to themselves (especially when talking
about newspaper postage rates) as organs
of public opinion, harbingers of light, pur-
veyors of knowledge. But the Flinders (Q.)
Chronicle speaks of itself with affectionate
confidence as “the good old Sossidge wrap
which stands for fair play all the time.”
Plain brother of the Chronicle, may your
sossige wrap never be used for a meaner
purpose!
THE PAD UPON THE KNEE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The descriptive work of the soldier letter-writers
at Gallipoli is being applauded by most pressmen.
Hence
We have heard about “the landing” and “the golden
Third Brigade” ;
But we knew they’d put the job through, for man-
fighting was our trade
Long before we took to workshops and the counter-
hand was bred ;
So we didn’t throw our hats up when Maclagau’s
heroes led.
But the thing that made us dizzy in our little
paper nest
Was the way they wrote about it when old Allah
gave it best,
For each man alive and dusty sat above the dreaming
sea
Writing sagas home to Mother with a pad upon his
knee.
There were journalists-in-waiting on the transports
far from shore,
Staring through expensive glasses, which could hardly
show them more
Than the woolly clouds of gun-smoke that the spit-
ting warships blew,
And ’twas very, very little that those staring press-
men knew ;
But the men who’d clattered inland sat and wrote
with sweaty hands
Red-hot epics they had lived through while an hour-
glass drained its sands ;
’Twixt one battle and another, in words unrestrained
and free,
They explained the thing to Mother with a pad upon
the knee.
When each hero is a Homer what about the Fourth
Estate ?
is the scribbling business finished? Is the scribe
right out of date?
Must good unionists be outed by the blackleg and
the scab
Who go in and make their stories while we (jyiye
round in a cab?
is the curse of education thus arriving at its roost?
Will the future generation pay no heed to puff or
boost ?
Oh, the mystery of “writin’ ” died in far Gallipo-lee
When the boys wrote home to Mother with a pad
upon the knee.

Why Stay Thin and Undeveloped ?
ANY WOMAN without full bust development
lacks the one essential that creates a perfect
appearance. Lack of proper bust develop-
ment, hollow cheeks and “salt cellars” quickly
take from a woman the bloom and freshness of
healthy womanhood. Misfortune may have been
your lot in so far as natural development is con-
cerned. but science has found a way to correct
your deficiency. Even though you have never
been full-bosomed, and have been attenuated all
your life, if you suffer from no wasting disease,
your bosom can be fully developed and your
weight increased to normal.... There are to-day
hundreds of women who were once thin, flat-
bosomed, hollow-cheeked and generally scraggly in
appearance, and suffering the effects of anaemia and
defective digestion, who are now T for the first time in
their lives healthy, full-bosomed and pink-cheeked,
and enjoying the full vigor of robust womanhood, as
the result of a few weeks under
DR. “FALLIERE’S FLESH-FOOD.”
“Flesh-Food” is totally harmless in every respect.
Its efficacy is beyond question, and its use is no
demand upon the subject's time. Many cases have
gained up to six pounds a week, and an increase in
bust measurement up to eight and ten inches is pos-
sible. “Flesh-Food” offers relief and development to
the thousands of chronically thin women who have
despaired of ever possessing a presentable figure. It
is a nerve and tissue food-treatment that adds weight
mid permanent development to attenuated woman.
Guarantee given in every case accepted.
The best evidence of what it may do for you is
—What Flesh-Food has done for thousands of
others, whose grateful evidence we give.
The Manager, Esperance, W.A.
Dear Sir, —Yours to hand. I am pleased to tell you that the result of
your Flesh-Food has fully exceeded my expectations. I have put on flesh and
increased in weight so rapidly that I discontinued taking the treatment,
although I have about a quarter of the supply left, and I was afraid I would
get too stout. I am very grateful to you for your attention, and I cannot
spealc too highly of your remedy, which I will recommend whenever I have
an opportunity. Yours truly, E. W. NEESON.
LET US SEND YOU SCORES
OF SPLENDID GRATEFUL
LETTERS.
“liiara,”
The Manager. Westviiie, N.S.W.
Dear Sir, —
I have finished the treatment, anti I am
more than pleased with the result. I have
gained both in weight and measurements, and
find myself in much better health than for a
long time past. Really, the results of your
treatment are wonderful, and in such a short
time, too.
Thanking you for all you have done for me.
Yours sincerely,
S. BOARDMAN.
SATISFIED WITH FIGURE NOW.
The Manager,— Waingake, N.Z.
Dear Sir, —In reply to your letter I am glad
to let you know that I do not require any
further treatment. I have certainly improved
in health, and I am quite satisfied with my
figure now.
Thanking you for your assistance.—l beg
to remain, yours sincerely,
ELSIE BOWER.
A NURSE’S EVIDENCE.
Manager,— Gyrnpie, Q.
Dear Sir, —As a nurse I was very interested
in your Flesh-Food treatment, and was greatly
surprised at the wonderful results in my case.
When I first wrote to you I was only skin
and bone, and I have good cause to be thank-
ful that I wrote you for a free sample, for I
feel certain now that I am one of the very
best advertisements you could possibly have,
as I am developed in every way satisfactory
to myself, and I have waited a good while to
prove if it was lasting in its effect, and I am
now glad to say that your splendid treatment
has done all you claimed it would, my weight
and measurements being ample.—l am, yours
gratefully, Mrs. E. WINGROVE.
GAINED OVER A STONE.
Dear Sirs, — 3linlaton, Sth. Aust.
Since using Flesh-Food I have gained over
141 b., which makes me now 11 stone, so that
I have no need for any more treatment.
Thanking you for your kindness, I remain,
yours truly,
S. DANNENBERG.
BEST POSSIBLE TREATMENT.
The Manager, Herons Creek.
Dear Sir, —Words fail entirely to express
my gratitude for what your great remedy
has done for me. I think Flesh-Food is the
best treatment possible under the circum-
stances, because it is more than certain in its
effect.
I have gained satisfactorily in weight, also
in measurements, and health greatly improved
as the result of your treatment. With many
thanks and kind regards.—Yours gratefully,
Mrs. ELIZABETH MeCARTHY.

“My son had been attended by a legally qualified doctor,
who pronounced him to be suffering from Pneumonia and
Pleurisy. In spite of the doctor’s treatment the child gradually
got worse, and the doctor pronounced the case hopeless.
He told me that the child could not live. At this stage I
obtained HEARNE’S Bronchitis Cure, and gave it
to the child, .according to the directions which accompany
each bottle. The child improved after the second dose.
He continued to improve each day from each dose of
HEARNE’S Medicine alone, and within three
days he was free from the Cough, Pneu-
monia and the Pleurisy. He was out
of bed at the end of a week, com-
pletely recovered.”

The German papers have discovered M ill
Dyson’s “Kultur Cartoons,” and are
vehement in expressing their disapproval.
One Berlin editor, however, kindly con-
cedes : “We admit he is offensive, this ape
smearing paper with his vile exudations.”
In England Dyson still gathers laurels.
Wells has appreciative mention of him
in his two latest novels, and Upton Sin-
clair devotes a poem to him in his new "His-
tory of Revolutionary Art.”
“Jwosp” : What a dull thing the war would
be without the censor! His latest happened
in connection wfitli Somerset Maugham’s
latest play, “Our Betters.” Maugham, a
surgeon, was with a British Field Ambu-
lance in Flanders, and between amputations
he revised the play and posted it. Where-
upon the Censor solemnly read the work and
branded it heavily: “Passed by Censor, H.M.
Expeditionary Forces.”
Time, which in police activity as in other
things ripens by seasons, is ripening for
another burst amongst Australian fortune-
tellers. Periodically members of the foorce
wrapped in plain clothes are sent on visits
to these frowsy people, and, disregarding the
plain facts of large feet and other things,
the seers spin to them the weary old tale of
the fair lady and the coming fortune and the
brooding danger. Yet the game is suffici-
ently profitable to survive discouragements.
At present various “spiritualists” are boldly
advertising, and with the assistance of the
right-thinking daily papers are reaping a
nice harvest from the relatives ot men ai
the Front. And, of course, the peddleis in
mystery only give sufficient dope to
further anxiety and further business, peeing
that quite a lot of the people who spend their
money on these frauds have, naturally, little
enough money on which to live, the business
is a cruel one, and calls for prompt treal-
ment with an axe.
“H. 0.” : The antics of the chief musical
comedian were beginning to be a trial even
to the faithful galleryites. As a comic coui-
tier in the palace scene he. was especially
fatiguing. “Where is his Majesty, he tuasecl
—“cannot I see him? I have been waiting
over half an hour for an audience. It was a
Billy Kangaroo who furnished the retort
obvious: “My oath, you wiR have to wait
longer than that for another !”
“Chug”: The other day I went to a
number of Sydney shops in search of a
centre-bit. I did not require, the article tor
purposes of burglary, but simply to make
an ordinary f-inch hole in a piece of wood,
Everywhere I found that the article was
out of stock. One shopman explained that
he could have sold a dozen that week, but
owing to the war none were obtainable,
Now, of all tools in common use there is
none more easily made. With a small ex-
penditure of time and labor I could con-
struct one myself, and I am certain any
decent fitter could turn them out by the
dozen. Why should the Australian market
be short of things of this kind? The recent
exhibition of Australian-made goods shows
that we are becoming a manufacturing
people; but our pace needs quickening a
lot before we come up to the level of our
opportunities. A lot of people* are pledging
themselves not to use German goods after
the war. It would be better if they could
be persuaded to use only Australian goods
now and always. What could be done, and
what should be done, is to prepare from
time to time from careful inquiry a. list of
the articles in common demand which are
not manufactured locally. We continue to
import many things, or in the event of ship-
ping delays do without them, simply because
nobody has called a manufacturer’s atten-
tion to the need of producing them here.
“Te W.” : Refuse fish and the coarser sorts
are used largely in some countries as manure.
In U.S.A., for instance, tons of tailer (which
the Yanks call “blue fish”) are so used. But
of Australia’s coarser fishes, so far as writer
knows, the so-called salmon (Arripis trutta) ,
only palatable when baked in lemon juice,
has alone been used as fertiliser. Many
years ago one Ferguson, a South Coast
(N.S.W.) pioneer, netted large numbers of
salmon in a narrow inlet, but as the big
bottle-green fish were voted tougher and 1
tasty than cow-skin, he had to hud a burial
place for them. He decided upon tn
potato field. Accordingly, as each furrow
was turned, one bare-legged urchin dropped
the tubers at the proper distance apart,
while another solemnly deposited a decaying
salmon between them. Those of Ferguson s
posterity who are still above-ground speak
of this crop of potatoes—the “salmon crop,
as it was called —-as the best ever grown
in the district. Recently, since the price ot
meat has soared, the once-despised salmon
finds a market and sells at Gd. per fish.
“Fax”: Among the lots of things which
Australians are learning is that the gum of
their native grass-trees, chemically treated,
produces picric acid, and that it was ex-
ported in quantities to Germany prior to the
war. Australians would now like to know
the names of the local agents concerned in
the exportation of this gum, ana whether
they knew they were providing the means
<y : German explosives. Are they the same
people who now export the gum to America,
and is there any guarantee that it doesn't
get to Germany after all? As for the Aus-
tralian manufacture of picric acid from the
native grass-tree product —well, “the matter
is receiving attention.” said Professor Mas-
son, of Melbourne, the other night. llow
much attention it is receiving he didn’t say.

POLITICAL
POINTS.
The gorgeous picture and the decorative
prose about a land flowing with milk and
honey and cocky sitting under a fig tree
didn't look good to Carmichael when he
inquired as a Commissioner into the affairs
of the Yanco (N.S.W.) irrigation settle-
ment. Carmichael tempers his report to
the Departmental lamb, but the meaning of
what he says is that the booming has been
TOO TOUGH TO CHEW.
there is an agitation in Germany over a recent
order prohibiting the sale of alcohol. The firms
interested have passed resolutions demanding that
the order be revoked.— Cable.
THE PLAIN-CLOTHES GERM: "Gott strafe it!
How the Devil can we swallow , our
Kaiser's victories without some lager to
wash them down!”
over the odds. But it ill becomes a Com-
missioner to even suggest that a settler,
deluded by the representation of prodigious
pumpkins and waving lucerne, could have
learned the truth if he had been less credu-
lous. Painting gaudy pictures is not a legi-
timate State enterprise. It is the illegiti-
mate dodge of private boodlers.
The Westralian Government's majority
has mislaid himself and been absent for so
long from his Parliamentary duties that his
seat has been declared vacant. Scaddan and
his friends are in an awkward position, but
they expect to retain the seat —for far-out
Roebourne—and get a member who will
attend more regularly and give the Govern-
ment less concern when it proceeds to play
the three-card trick with the State’s credi-
tors and monkey Avith the statutory sinking
funds.
Farewelled by the women’s social league
or the S. Aus. Labor Party, Private Dennv,
Attorney-General in Verran’s Cabinet, made
his strongest attack yet on “the Vaughan
family.” Denny was prepared to bet, he
said, that if he returns from the war he
will find that “not one sei*ious attempt will
have been made to put a single plank of the
Labor party on the statute-book.” Taken
with the revolt and expulsion of Wilson, and
the equally straight-out charge of Ryan in
the Assembly that Vaughan has failed to
keep his pledges on the Education question,
this looks like stormy waters ahead for the
Labor Government.
The rift in the Labor party’s lute in South
Aus. suddenly widened into a crack last
week. The party, “in a conference of 234
members, representing every part of the
State, expelled J. P. Wilson by resolution
without a single dissentient.” so the secre-
tary told the newspapers. Wilson’s offences
were (1) a support of Peake on one occa-
sion last year; (2) his position on the
Railways Standing Committee. For the
latter job Jelley was the party’s nominee;
but the Liberal majority appointed Wilson
instead, along with their own representative.
Wilson, who was the former holder of the
position, was told to resign, but declined;
hence the expulsion. Says Wilson, mixing
his metaphors gloriously :
The young bloods by log-rolling' are* undermining
and displacing the older men of the party. Many of
them are now reaping the fruits of past victories won
while they were in swaddling clothes, or writing and
talking vehemently against the Labor party. I refer,
of course, to the Vaughans.
Wilson intends to stick to his Leg. Council
seat, which is his for several years yet. He
“will not pease to be a Laborite,” but will
merely object to the workers being repre-
sented by “a Single-tax Freetrade party.”
The Leg. Council being already anti-Labor,
his vote is not vital to the party, anyway.
Some people get satisfaction out of queer
things. Here, for instance, is Stead, of the
Refuse, extracting honey from the fact that
we have alongside us millions of colored
workers so poorly paid that they can flood
our market and reduce our own labor to the
same low’ level as theirs:—
We are g;lad to welcome the products of the in-
dustrious little men and women from the north of
Australia... .we are able to get almost everything
we have hitherto obtained from Germany from our
Japanese ally It will cost us less This is a
comforting thing, -as no matter how high the tariff
we should be able to get Japanese goods cheaper
than any others.
Observe the usual cant of it —“the products
of the industrious little men and women.”
It is the Asiatics’ “industry” with which
the Steads salve tlieir conscience. Sweating,
or what would be sweating of the most
horrid character if practised in Melbourne,
doesn’t matter to the Nonconformist Con-
science if it is practised in Tokio. What is
infamy in Collingwood is “industry” in
Nagasaki, and the Conscience thanks God
for it because “it will cost us less.”
The young men’s Bible-class behavior of
the S. Aus. Parliament is now definitely a
memory, and nothing more. From recent
proceedings:—-
Smeaton: You cur!
Peake: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker
Smeaton: I withdraw.
Moseley: Mr. Speaker, is the member for Sturt
[Smeaton] in order in coming to me and stating he
would like me to go outside? If his constituents
want a new member I will go out.
Peake: This bully did it.
Chesson: You ought to go back to school and get
the schoolmaster to birch you.
Peake: Mr. Speaker, I want to know if a member
of this House is in order when he comes to me and
calls me a scoundrel. I will not submit to this.
That comes of formally deciding to be affable
during the currency of the war.
It takes a great daily such as the Argus
to put us all right in the matter of exchange
and supply and demand and so on. Sneering
at the story of “exploiters holding stocks of
food stuffs” it proceeds to show that owing
to low stocks—•
The consumption of meat had to be checked. High
prices checked it. If food were arbitrarily made
cheap in time of scarcity it would be eaten as if
no scarcity were to be faced, and when eaten the
population would starve.
How beautiful it was of the dealers to
double the price of rabbits lest the supply
should run out! The gentlemen who made a
fortune out of the corner did it simply to
prevent starvation. It was merely forgetful-
ness on their part that they did not hand
the extra profit to the Government represent-
ing the community.
That noisy patriot, Melbourne Argus,
which has never been patriotic enough to
call for a prohibitive Customs tariff, was
handed a nasty one by Attorney-General
Hughes the other day:—
It would appear that there is a patriotism which
spends itself in words and is never translated into
action.... I said in the House of Representatives,
and the fact received the widest possible publicity,
that the Government had decided not to carry
through the Post Office any newspaper containing
advts. of goods largely made by German Anns, yet
yesterday a quarter-page advertisement of a German
medicine anueared in the Argus. Newspapers so
offending will not be cii-culated.
Then the Argus wept into her gin and com-
plained bitterly over the fence to the lady
next door.
CASTING DOWN THE IDOLS.
One of the “reproductive works” the
State Government of Tasmania has on hand
is an extension of the Derwent Valley rail-
way for either 101 or Ilf miles (they don’t
know which yet) along a route surveyed
years ago by the Great Western syndicate.
A Parliamentary Committee has found that
an attempt is being made to carry out this
great undertaking with one resident engi-
neer, two visiting engineers who go up
once a week or thereabouts, and a third
visiting engineer who only goes up occa-
sionally. There were two resident engineers,
one for each end, but one has been trans-
ferred. Then there are a surveyor or two
and a paymaster, who has to deal with the
wages of as many as 50 men without assist-
ance. No wonder one of the visiting
engineers complained in evidence that the
job was under-staffed, and that there ought
to be a costs clerk and one or two other
officers. The original estimate for the line
was £30,000. It has cost £42,000 so far,
and it is hoped that it will be finished for
about £67,000.
THE STROKE.
The combined Commonwealth and State income
taxes run up to 6s. 3d. in the &.—News item.
THE WIFE: “What is the nature of the
seizure, Doctor ?”
THE DOCTOR: “Six-and-threepence in the £,
Madam.”
It looks as if the Liberals in the Tas-
manian State Parliament are going to stay
out of office, for there was no rush for the job
of leader when N. K. Ewing dropped it for
a Judgeship. The billet went to W. H. Lee,
who heads the wowser section in the party.
Lee is a waggon-builder at Longford when
he is at home, and turns out first-class
vehicles; but he knows next to nothing
about the political coach.
Even the farming of a mass of public
works to the Norton Griffiths syndicate ha*
not reduced the loan expenditure of the
N.S.W. State Government. The temporary
Supply passed through Parliament lasi
week provided for the expenditure of
£966,530 on works not included in the acti-
vities of the five per cent, contractors ; and
it is all to go within two months. That is
at a rate of £5,799,180 per annum; and
with the £4,000,000 that Norton Griffiths is
to expend, and the little extra amounts that
are bound to present themselves, the loan
spendings for 12 months are likely to be
about £10,000,000 —if Cohen doesn’t close
down. This looks a fine, large sum to be
spent by a Government that is in a per-
manent condition of searching its pants for
stray coins; and the thought of the smash
that will happen when Cohen does close
down should be making some people feel
very uncomfortable.
Nationalisation of the liquor trade in the
Northern Territory became an official fact
last week when the Federal Executive Coun-
cil passed an ordnance covering the trans-
action. Under this ordnance the sly-grog
business is not likely to be particularly
popular. Private Enterprise will import
liquor or introduce it or cause it to be sold
or offered for sale or supplied at risk of a
£5OO fine or 12 months’ imprisonment or
both together. That “both together” a few
times should place serious restraint on trade.
Led by Holman, of N. S. Wales, the State
Premiers still have hopes of inducing the
Commonwealth to make an ad misericordiam
appeal to John Bull for money to pour out
on vote-catching public works which could
in practically every instance wait. To
badger J. Bull for money for such a purpose
in his present financial straits is just about
the most unpatriotic thing that any politi-
cian could be guilty of. How hard-pressed
Britain is for the money necessary to save
the Empire’s life may be judged by the fact
that for the £100,000,000 which is being got
from the U.S.A. 5 per cent, is being paid,
and the loan is being issued at 98, with 2
per cent, underwriting commission ; further,
the subscribers have the right to demand
either per cents, at the end of five years
or cash. In addition to the offer of a 4-J
per cent, stock in five years this means that
the Government is paying now the equivalent
of 6 per cent, for the £loo,ooo.ooo—an
almost unheard of figure. Consols, for in-
stance, before the war carried only 2£ per
cent. And still, with Britain desperately
paying such a price as 6 per cent., these
dreadrul State vote hunters propose to harry
John Bull for money for their own miserable
little schemes.
Uhero are moments when the Argus Is
almost sane. For instance :
It has been possible in the past to balance anv
excess of imports by the borrowings of both private
and public bodies in London, but this assistance has
now come to an end. .. .From every economic stand-
point it is desirable that a reduction of imports
should take place, and while the shortages in spot
stocks may tempt some traders to place substantial
orders abroad, that course may yet prove unfortu-
nate, both to the individual and the community.
How the Argus is going to stop these
traders from working disaster to themselves
and the community it doesn’t say. There
is only one tried method for turning the
importer into a really safe and useful citizen
and restoring the balance of trade. That is
by making him an Australian manufacturer;
and a few polite words of warning in a
Freetrade newspaper are not likely to be
enough to do it.
THE REFORMERS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The Postmaster-General stated to-dav that a num-
ber of reforms in connection with his department had
been effected without fuss. During the last few days
a saving of £3OOO a year was made by the discon-
tinuance of the midday letter delivery in the suburbs
alone.— News item.
He was a hard-up grocer-man who found his business
going back ;
He hit upon a clever plan by which to dodge financial
wrack ;
lie did not cut expenses down, or sack the boy. Oh,
no ! He found
That he could swindle Jones and Brown of one full
ounce in every pound 1
He charged the same old price, of course—he was
the only grocer there ;
A fact which gave an added force to claims that it
was “hardly fair.”
When Jones and Brown found out the game they both
commenced to swear and storm.
The grocer answered: “Mine the blame; it is my
method of Reform!”
X dame who kept a boarding-house was much dis-
tressed to find one day
That, through her lack of brains, or nous, she couldn't
make the hashed thing pay !
She didn't like to raise her terms—the boarders
were a “tony” bunch —-
So, after many mental squirms, the dame announced
she'd cut out lunch!
The boarders were a bit surprised at this departure
from the norm: ,
The landlady apologised with: “That’s my method of
Reform !
Two meals a day are ample, now: I think the idea
immense!”....
The boarders made a fearful row at this Reform at
their expense!
(But what the Hades could they do ? It was the
only boarding-house!)

SPORTING
NOTIONS
There is only one thing to be said about
the A.J.C. Derby. Wallace Isinglass ran like a
quitter, and was lucky to get even second money.
On the autumn running the colt’s brilliant gallop in
the Rosehill Guineas and his work on the track, the
race looked the best of good things. At 5 to 2 on
the public filled the Bar Tons’ bags to bursting—
and the pot boiled over, and great was the joy in
the Land of Judah! Lewis let the favorite run
along in the lead at an easy pace for a mile, and
then sharpened up the speed. Cetigne moved reso-
lutely forward, and a quarter of a mile further on
was at his girths. According! to previous form this
is just where Cetigne should have had enough ; but
he hadn’t, and though Lewis showed Wallace Isin-
glass the flail they landed into the straight together,
just clear of Westcourt and Gringo. At the Leger
stand Cetigne had his head in front. The struggle
was quickly decided. Brown’s colt got up again,
and Lewis, drawing the whip on him, made a call
for the final effort that would break down the opposi-
tion and land the ribbon. But he flinched, and
running over bumped Cetigne rather badly. The
latter smartly recovered his stride, and, sticking to
it like a tradesman, outgalloped and outstaved the
other, winning by a clear length. Westcourt would
certainly have been second had he not been thrown
out of his line by the jostle. Of course it may be
said that the form disclosed in this race is all
wrong, and that Wallace Isinglass would have won
had he not been made too much use of in the early
part of the go. There is not much in this, because
the pace over the first mile was very moderate
indeed, and it was Cetigne that had to make the
greater effort over the last four furlongs. The
writer noticed that at Rosehill the colt’s viciously-
wagging- tail indicated that he didn’t like being made
to hurry too much at the end of a mile and a
furlong, and wondered what would happen if the
animal were bustled over the rear end of a longer
journey. He found out on Saturday at Randwick, and
also acquired a lurking suspicion that, had Westcourt
not been interfered with, Cetigne's neck would have
been stretched to the uttermost.
What a perfect galloper Woorak is—when in the
humor! The Epsom was not a race. It was a pro-
cession. Nothing else had a chance. He simply
buried Garlin in the run home, winning without
apparent effort in what under the circumstances
was amazingly good time. Brattle, Blague, First
Principle and Garlin were all well away, but after
covering a couple of furlongs the chestnut’s white
face appeared in the van, and reaching out like a
greyhound he led into the straight a clear three
lengths to the good from Garlin and First Principle.
Wren’s horse made an effort to reach the flying
leader, but might as well have tried to catch a
comet. First Principle decided that it was no
place for him, and promptly faded away. Woorak
won by nearly 20.vds.; it seemed as if he could have
made it fifty. Through the donkey-licked field
Golden Hop and Aurifer struggled in to the places
more or less on sufferance. Woorak looked a
mighty different horse from the Woorak of the
autumn, and is just now at the very top of his
form. If he could be depended upon there is cer-
tainly nothing in Australia that could live with
him over a mile.
They tried to win the Spring Stakes (lij mile)
with Cagou (9st. 51b.) from end to end. He was
done with a quarter of a mile from home, and
Mountain Knight (9st.) ran into the straight with
the race apparently in hand. But Reputation
(9st. 51b.) and St. Carwyne (9st.) quickly settled
the favorite, and coming away over the last fur-
long fought out a desperate finish, in which the
judge was unable to separate them. The journey
was covered in “thirty-two,” which makes out Reputa-
tion to be quite as good as his Maoriland form had
indicated. Mountain Knight's performance was not
particularly impressive, but he was scarcely ready
for such a gruelling test as the pace imposed. Nor,
perhaps, were Uncle Sam, Ulva’s Isle and St.
Alwynton. All of these will probably be in better
trim at Melbourne.
* * * *
On Saturday’s form St. Carwyne (Bst.
81b.) stood out as the pick of the field in the Metro-
politan, run on Monday. In the Spring Stakes he
dead-heated with Reputation, giving the Maori-
Jander 51b. In the Metrop. he had 111 b. off his
back, Reputation being only down lib. If, there-
fore, St. Carwyne would but gallop as he had done
on the opening day, whatever beat him would have
to do something sensational. The public, remember-
ing Rosehill, where St. Carwyne had obviously
funked it, and recollecting William the Silent’s fine
gallop in the Trial on Saturday, looked to the pony
to do this thing. So St. Carwyne started at 7’s,
William at 5 to 2. There were punters who even
gave Garlin a winning chance, and some who backed
Giru. How they reckoned it out Heaven onlv
knows, for on paper they hadn’t a possible chance.
William the Silent got badly away. At the back
he was pocketed for a time, and had to make up
all the leeway round the turn, while St. Oarwyue
yvas running along comfortably ahead. But make
it up the little fellow did in good style, fighting
out a great race up the straight with St. Carwyne,
who stuck to his job again this time, and got there
under punishment by a long neck. Reputation
carried his steadier of Bst. 131 b. into a creditable
third, indicating some more that in the w.f.a. races
he is going to be pretty hard to beat. If William
the Silent were able to discuss the matter he would
probably explain that he was a very unlucky prad
to miss the big - stake. And none of the other nags
would contradict him.
The A.J.C. handieapper has given at, least
three indirect tips for the Caulfield and Melbourne
Cups. He rated Rend at Bst. 41b. for the Metropoli-
tan, whereas the V.A.T.C. and V.R.C. handicappers
let the same gee off with 7st. lib. and 7st. 21b. If
Fend’s running in the Epsom was correct, the Vic-
torian estimate of his quality was the right one.
Red Dennis and Donore, a' couple of uncertainties
from England, are also matters of conflicting opinion
between the men in Sydney and Melbourne. The
V.R.C. handieapper has been particularly kind to
both of them.
* * * *
“T.F.”: Those who looked for an Epsom
Handicap tip got it in a Sydney press item: “After
exercising on the tan at Randwick yesterday the
free-going Woorak was pulled up with the bit out
of his mouth —it had been drawn through by Woorak's
efforts to control his rider, K. Bracken. A little
blood came from Woorak’s mouth as the result of
a slight laceration.” Any racecourse “flat” would
know that the horse's sore mouth wouldn’t be inter-
fered with after that. In the race Woorak was given
a free head, and that was all he asked for. Pity
some other horses couldn’t hurt their mouths and be
given a chance to tide their backers over rent-day.
* * * *
“Saddle-up”: Woorak this year broke the
long run of wins by non-favorites in the Epsom Han-
dicap at Randwick ; the previous favorite to win was
Famous, back in 1903 In the Epsom field of 31
there were nine horses which took part in the race
in 1914; Golden Hop (second) and Aurifer (third)
were two of them.... Garlin’s failure on Saturday
leaves Hyman on the records as the only animal to
win Doncaster and Epsom in the same year; Hyman
did the trick in 1909.... K. Bracken is developing
an appetite for Epsom Handicaps, having won on
Aleconner in 1913 and Woorak in 1915 A. Wood,
rider of Derby winner Cetig'ne, has had seven mounts
in the big race; Saturday’s was his first win.... 8.
Lewis, second, on Wallace Isinglass, has ridden three
A.J.C. Derby winners; while W. McLachlan, third
on Westcourt, won on Mountain,Knight in 1914....
Cetigne. cost bookmaker G. Barnett 200 guineas as
a yearling, and in five wins and two seconds has
landed over £ll,OOO in prize-money, with a hatful
of likely things ahead Diavola, winner of Hurdles
was a champion hack-racer in Maoriland before it
began to earn oats and move over the obstacles.
The second edition of J. J. Miixer's
Sporting Pamphlet couldn’t wait for the results of
the A.J.C. meeting. It carries the records of the
Melbourne and Caulfield Cup entrants as far as
September 29, and leaves students of form to keep
their own accounts of the happenings at Randwick.
The running at Flemington last Saturday
pointed to at least four horses as likely winners of
big events between now and the end of Melbourne
Cup meeting. though it gave no line of comparison
between the cracks on the Victorian side and the
coming top-uotellers from Sydney. Burradeen and
Patrobas distinguished themselves over 10 furlongs.
Ihe imported Lavendo beat Traquette and De Gama
for the October Stakes (10 furlongs) in quick time
and with an impressive sprint at the finish. And
(he sluggish Marculfus, with 9st. 41b. up, ran suffi-
ciently well to comfort his early backers for the
Melbourne Cup, in which he is weighted at 7st. 41b.
The V.A.T.C. meeting starts on Saturday,
When Patrobas, the improving three-year-old in
\Vheeler’s stable, will be expected to win Caulfield
Guineas. The son of Wallace—Sizzle looks like having-
a big say also in the V.R.C. Derby, and one or both
of the Cups. The Toorak Handicap, run over the
Guineas course, should bring imported Cyklon to the
point, presuming that the much-talked-of but non-
proven flier is sufficiently sound and seasoned to do
his best. Cyklon, bred to English time, is nominally
a six-year-old, and if he is to make good in the
forthcoming Cups the veteran should be pretty nearly
wound up by next Saturday. His English form
was fairly good, and'he has perhaps improved by the
change to Australia. At any rate, Cvklon is' sus-
pected of being easily the best nag in James Scobie’»
stable.
* * * *
At the annual meeting of the V.A.T.C.
last week somebody voiced a general complaint that
the blocking of the tote in Victoria is “a crvin°-
shame, ’ seeing that four other States have got it.
He might have said “a crying scandal,” as it is also
mN. S. Wales. Chairman Geo. Woodforde agreed
that “the vast majority of racing people here would
like to see the totalisator.” The Government lias
been appioached ’ by the V.R.C. vc this crying
shame. The A.N.A. has passed a resolution in favor
of the machine. Likewise a number of women who
concern themselves in the management of public
hospitals. . But the power of bookmakers to prevent
the legalising of betting machines in those two States
where the parasites are most numerous and wealthv
is seemingly stronger than ever. Nobody can pretend
that the ignorant wowser antipathy ‘to a lawful
betting machine is proportionately stronger in N S
Wales and Victoria than in, say, South Aus. It is
the bookmaker’s influence which does the mischief
And how does it work? Somebody benefits by the
large sum of money expended by the Ikey Mo
Defence League every year. When the fact becomes
sufficiently scandalous the politicians and notorious
wowsers who are not squared or nobbled will begin
im * ce , suspected of being the creatures of Ikey Mo.
Then they will consider the advisability of assisting
to pass a Tote Bill in order that a smellful scandal
may and forgotten.
With the military in possession of
Morphettville racecourse, all Adelaide racing has to
be clone on the Old Course—equally well appointed
and more central. It was possibly owing to the
change of scene that a crack amateur rider from
the South-east pulled up his mount at the wrong
spot in an event at the Hunt Club races, and lost
by 10 lengths, instead of winning by 20. Natur-
ally, a horrible row followed, and the stewards,
though sympathising with the poor chap’s uncom-
fortable position, felt bound to suspend him for six
months, to teach him to be more careful about learn-
ing the landmarks. Exactly the same thing, by the
way, happened at a Hunt Club meeting a few years
ago. The Ladies’ Bracelet was won by Les Aldridge,
who has been on the winner six times in all, and for
the past seven years has not been out of a place.
The Hunt Club Cup went to High Degree, with
Sharebroker, the favorite, a bad second; both are
ex-Victoria ns. The Master of the Hunt, Luxmoore,
has gone to the Dardanelles, and a former master,
Carew Reynell, was lately killed there!
“Chinchin”: They had a patriotic race
meeting: at Maryborough (Q.) the other day, and
this is how Our Empire Handicap finished: —

* * * *
Here’s another one from Maorilaud. The
Otago Hunt Club held a patriotic meeting at
Dunedin, awl in its enthusiasm named the events
this way: Dardanelles Steeplechase, Jellicoe Handicap,
and so on. The Hunt Club Cup had no martial flavor
attached to it, but several up-country papers, feeling
that something was wrong, blew out with the event
as the Hun Club Cup!

Herb McCoy found a whole cartload of
trouble waiting for him at Sydney Stadium on
Saturday, and it fell on him all at once. He got a
hiding, a disqualification and a rare good hooting
from the crowd. He richly deserved the lot. The
disturbance was to decide the lightweight champion-
ship of Australia, and Tommy Uren, the Sydney lad
who came into prominence lately by disposing of
Granwell and Jack Clune, had it all lover the Vic-
torian from the first collision. He opened by smit-
ing McCoy with unpleasant emphasis on the ear, and
before the sting of this had been absorbed he pushed
a hard left into what the other fellow talks
through. McCoy scored best at in-fighting, but
there was not a great deal of it. Of the boxing he
had all the worst, Uren’s right turned out to be
unplayable, and in the third round, had he been
more combative and gone in after his man with
greater resolution, he could have finished him up.
At the sixth time of asking the Sydney-sider got to
work without apology, and practically did what he
liked. Within a minute McCoy was a beaten man—
and knew it. The writer counted 14 hard rights
make contact with the champion’s head and jaw.
By that time he was done to a turn, but suddenly
pulling himself together he swung his hanging right
glove upwards, making contact fairly under the vic-
torious enemy's groin. It was a brutal thing to do.
Uren went down flop, as white as a sheet. Harald
Baker ordered McCoy out of the ring, and gave the
fight to Uren, who was. picked up and carried to his
corner. As the whipped and disgraced man made his
way out the crowd told him what it thought of him.
It nearly blew the roof oil'.
McCoy’s offence was shocking, mainly on account
of its cruel deliberation. What he did Was to intro-
duce a variation of “La Savate,” in which a kick
in the groin is pne of the convincing features. A
possible explanation may be that the man was so
badly rattled that he did not know what he was
doing, but in the case of an experienced pug like
McCoy this is hardly good enough. More-
over, McCoy had fought none too cleanly in the
earlier rounds. Once lie made use of the rabbit-
killer in a way that was very close to the border-
line, and on several occasions used his head as an
extra hand. Saturday’s must surely have been his
last appearance. To put such a man into the ring
again would be exposing an opponent to risks
which are not part of the game. Compared with
what McCoy did Jeff Smith’s fouling of Darcy was
an act of gentle eourtesv..

John Haynes, lately elected to the N.S.W.
Assembly for Willoughby (Sydney), has one record,
anyhow'—of having had scraps within the precincts
of the House with three Ministers. These were
James Fletcher, Tom Hassall and W. P. Crick. The
disturbance with Fletcher was the most serious.
Neither Hassall nor Crick really meant business. But
lietcher was very wrath. Crossing the floor of the
Assembly he seized John by the throat and earnestly
proceeded to throttle him. Haynes went after £ 5000
damages, the case being heard before Justice
Stephen. Rogers and H. E. Cohen appeared for John,
and Jack Want and Tom O’Mara for Fletcher
1 arkes gave evidence that “defendant shook the
plaintiff as a terrier would a rat.” The jury said
that the fiver paid into court by Fletcher was suffici-
ent compensation.

Sydney cricketers opened their season on
Satuidaj with a series of “friendly” games—that is
games carrying no competition points. War has
thinned the teams considerably, and it is doubtful if
some of the old clubs colors will be seen on
the first-grade pitches later in the year. It
wiit be an. honorable dav in the history of
whichever ribbon is missing. Eight balls to
the over are on trial this season, and on Saturday
most players, without binding themselves to a definite
?P™ on, 1 were favorably inclined to the experiment.
H the day s play is any criterion the scheme will be
a run-promoter, as there were exceptionallv few
maiden overs. The highest individual score of the
day was 154, made in 138 minutes bv J. M. Tavlor
for Petersham against Sydney. Taylor'is the New'ing-
ton School student wdio showed up prominentlv in
classma l company last season. Amongst the bowlers
Live, foi Gordon, drew special attention by the wav
he rattled North Sydney's sticks in the first innings
He bagged five for 43, and did the hat trick to
show that lie to detain the team.

in Melbourne on Saturday, with the district clubs '
plajing the usual rounds of games, but without
competing for a pennant. Some of the late stars
have gone to play the war game, but the gaps are
not nearly as numerous as in the lioofballers’ ranks

Also I itzroy s seasoned veteran, Chris Iviernan

S.A. Cricket Association annual meeting
was presided over by the veteran Edwin Smith who
reviewed current affairs in a half-hour’s speech just
to show that Ins 85 years do not trouble him. The
balance-sheet shows a loss of £3BO, nearlv £lOOO
having been spent, in last year’s drought, on boring
:? ra .° oc water supply, which ought to pay for
itselt in time by saving water-rates. The Associa-
tion has £4500 cash in hand, which it wisely pro-
poses to hold on to, instead of building the new
stands for which the plans are all ready. The ques-
tion of a coach to replace Crawford has been shelved
for the present, too. Clem Hill and Jack Reed-
man were made life-members, in recognition of past
services, and it was decided to hang by Victor
4 rumper’s portrait, in the pavilion at the' Oval, a
copy of the message of warm sympathy which S.A.
sent to N.S.W. on his death.

It seems a bad time to bog into the busi-
ness of motor-racing; but some enthusiasts in Mel-
bourne, having acquired a sort of semi-option under
Government control over the bike track at the Sports
Ground on the Yarra side, propose to spend £5OOO
in hard cash on banking it up into a sort
of asphalted saucer that will allow cars and
bikes to whiz round in safety—or alleged safety
at 100-miles an hour. It is intended to have things
in running order before the summer is over, and to
hold races at night. As the track is but three laps
to the mile there are hair-raising- possibilities ahead
of us.

The Indian has been awarded the Grand
Prize for motor-cycles at the Panama Exposition as
a result of motor-vehicle re-classification. In the
original classification of motor-vehicles automobiles
and motor-cycles were grouped under one head ; but
the incorrectness of this grouping having been
brought to the notice of the jury, a re-classification
was made, and motor-cycles were classed as separate
vehicles, with the foregoing result.

The western districts of N. S. Wales have
been farewelling their champion cyclist, R. G. Honey-
man, who is off to the rendezvous of Young Aus-
tralia these days. As a wheelman he has won the

race at Ashfield, Bathurst to Orange and return, the
double at Bathurst, Lithgow and Orange, second in
Sydney Eight Hour Wheel Race, and fourth in Syd-
ney to Gouiburn road race. That’s enough till'he

Eight of the “All Black” team that in-
\acled California from Maoriland a couple of years
ago and cleaned up the place are either helping to
make Abdul Turkey shiver in his capital or are
V 1 hospital behind the fighting lines. Incidentally,
J. E. Cuthill, who was a member of the team and
was recently reported killed by the Turk, savs that

CuttnH was wounded, but, as far as lie knows,
not fatally.
The two Brady boys who played football
ror St. Hilda last season are doing their bit at the

of these was captain of the Murtoa football club

boys fighting for their country has got a hi me field

“Bias”: “Pennant” (B. SO/O/’li)). in
reply to a mild protest at the system of tipping by
means of which certain of the bowling chibs pay
wages, argues that because N.S.W. bowlers put up
£lO,OOO for the Patriotic funds they are above
reproach. Dunno what that has to do with the
Point, unless it is an evidence that the clubs could
afford to pay their employees decently. If “Pen-
nant” is an employee I’ll put the case to him this
way: YY hat would be his feelings if his boss paid
him half salary and left him to secure the other
half from the generosity of customers or guests?
* * * . *
‘Green”: Sydney bowlers have gone a
step towards settling an outstanding grievance which
divides their little world. The Pennant competi-
tions are so long-drawn-out that the bulk of the
members can’t get a game 011 Saturday afternoons.
hey are tired of watching the same batch of
players who for 20 years in some instances have
had places in. the pennant rinks, and who are so
jealous of their status that the youngjer generation
cannot get a footing among the elect. At the
annual- general meeting on September .30 this sec-
tion, “The Short Pennants,” led bv vice-president
Harry . Scott, demanded reform. “The Long Pen-
nants,’ led by doughty bowlers of vore, opposed it
on the ground that match play was' the salt of the
game, and if competitions were curtailed the standard
of play would deteriorate. Better a few real top-
notchers, said they, who could knock spots oft'
champions from Victoria and M.L., than a host of
moderates. “The Longs” put up a great fight, lmi
“The Shorts” had the numbers on their side and
carried Scott’s proposal to shut down on the long
Pennant.

Anglers visiting the South of the Loanly

matters. To him is due the credit for flic introduc-
tion of trout into the mid-Ganterbiirv (M.L.) streaans
well over 42 years ago. The old fellow was born in
London, and the Great Angler, played him for 82

Masetto”: Among the many swimmers
who took part in the annual “All Clothes On” race
for the veterans in the Serpentine (Hyde Park.
London) was John Classey, who. although 88 years
old, swam the distance on his back. For 60 years
this rare old sport has been a regular competitor m
the contest.
The strong Sydney Swimming Club doesn't
see its way to hold its usual programme this season.
Among the contests to be suspended are the W. W.
It ill Cup and the B. I. Swannell Cup. Swannell was
a leading member of the club, and had donated the
cup for annual competition. In view of his recent
death in Gallipoli, the club feels a natural diffidence
in competing for his trophy.

“Strike” : The N. S. Wales baseball fight
provides the addresses of a lot of fine recruiting-

the pick of playing spaces not given over to cricket

scramble between the rival sections for public sup-
port. Professionalism in Australian ’ball lurks in a

WHY YOU SHOULD LEARN TO BOX.
cv
Because it enables you to take your own part with the next
man.
You yourself can mention many instances when a knowledge
of the art would have come in handy.
This knowledge builds up confidence in your ability, and when
you know you can do a thing—well, you can perform it easily.
When you know' you are a good Boxer, you can easily defeat a
man who has not learned how to defend himself. You certainly
have the advantage of him.
1 Teach Boxing by Post.
The instruction is practical, simple and easily
understood. It thoroughly explains and illustrates
every serviceable move in Scientific Boxing'. Iloie
is what one pupil imports:—
“Before starting on your instruction I thought
a fighter was bon). lam now satisfied that
your lessons will make almost any man an effici-
ent fighter.”
You ought to write for my illustrated booklet,

“H.T.” : That Necessity is the mother-in-law
of Getting Busy was impressed on me some time back.
I Was condemned to stay at Woop-Woop, the end of
all things, about 80 miles back from Yallanoo. The
storekeeper, Jerry Johnson, was the whole township.
His jobs included postmaster, blacksmith, parson
when necessary, and encyclopedia all the time. His
stock of patent medicines and horse pills raised him
to the status of chemist, dentist, vet. and general
practitioner. Jerry could cure anything bar “rigor
mortis” and thirst for beer. When Old Charlie
Adams slid down the mountain-side to consult Jerry
he was in a terrible state —“all of a dither,” as lie
put it himself. His trouble was mostly located in
his tongue, which had swollen worse than the head
of a High Commissioner, and was tender and touchy
to boot. “Wot yer been doin’? Drinking ‘ackua
forty’?” asked Jerry, proud of his technical know-
ledge. “Never drank no ‘ackua’ in me life,” replied
Charlie. “Smoke pretty much, I s’pose?” continued
the doctor. “Yus, about two ounces' o’ a day, ’
mentioning his favorite weed. “No wonder your
tongue’s a mass o’ infliction,” said Jerry immedi-
ately. “You switch off that outer this,” and he
handed down a lib. tin of “Happy Thoughts”
Tobacco. “You’ll be another man inside a week.”
Jerry remarked to me afterwards: “If these coots
would onlv stick to a fair dinkum bacca like HAPPY
THOUGHTS they wouldn't ’ave none of these
troubles. I been sellin’ Happy Thoughts for years in
plugs an’ tins, an’ I never noo anyone to suffer from
it, even if he smoked like a chimbley.”*
“Quidam”: A good old true-blue English-
man is calling on his countrymen to beware
bow they cast down any more o.f the mttion’s
ancient josses, because “if (treat Britain had
not its old institutions, customs, etc., it could
not be so patriotic as it is.” And he cries to
them to preserve “the individuality of the
Briton,” “so that the world can progress.”
I have no doubt the world will progress;
but will England? And the Empire? That’s
what we have to consider. The “individual-
ity of the Briton” is well exemplified in the
mind that opposes national military service;
that thwarts State regulation of gambling,
industry and sexual matters ; that toys with
technical training; that inculcates no serious
spirit of national uuty; that does little to
restrict the robbery of the poor by the rich
in the sacred name of Private Enterprise;
that will not prevent the expulsion of Brit-
ishers from ''British industries. This same
individuality is advertised by the large pro-
portion of shirkers who assert their patriot-
ism by loafing at home while better men
tight: by the Government’s very feeble attack
on the inflated war profits of England’s
large commercial sharks; by the dreadfully-
dangerous strikes among the coal-miners, in-
censed at the fact that the price of their pro-
duct has risen from 18s. to oss. per ton since
the war, while the miners get about od. a ton
extra for hewing it; by the fact that, unlike
her Continental allies, England’s Government
was obliged to violently crawfish when it and
the great individualistic liquor industry
came into collision; and by various other
little matters that suggest that British indivi-
duality wants attacking with an axe.

Look to Your Teeth.
There are no teeth like those furnished by
Nature. For service, comfort, and good
health, artificial teeth cannot be com-
pared with a natural set.
Sensible people will accordingly try to pre-
serve their teeth as long us possible by
keeping them clean. Cold water and soap
and water are useful, but are somewhat
ineffectual. Rough powders, such as cuttle-
fish, crabseyes, crude chalks and charcoal
are too severe on the enamel.

cally prepared to clean the teeth, sweeten

How hopeless for the present situation
are statesmen of the Asquith and Balfour
order! Balfour, being asked to explain why
London is not as well defended against Zep-
pelins as Paris is, said “The defence of Paris
and London are not identical. Paris is a
great military fortress, whereas London is
not fortified and under the laws of civilised
warfare should not be subjected to these
attacks.” What in the name of Hoggen-
heimer have the laws of civilisation to do
with the case? If the whole British army
died of poison gas, would it be any excuse
for the War Office to plead that poison gas
and burning liquid sprays were German in-
fractions of Hague Convention law? Bri-
tain is dealing with the mad dogs of Europe,
not with combatants who abide by the laws
of wap; and the mad dogs will go on scoring
for just as long as the dilettante Balfour
and the detached Asquith continue to think
and act as though fair play can always beat
foul play in any game on earth.
Many men have had the chance to read
their obituary notices, but very few can
write their own and read it long after. The
Loch Torridon, a 2000-ton liner well known
in Australia any time the last 30 years,
was recently bought by a Finland firm, and
soon after met her end. making sure it was
their end, too, a last message was sent away
in a bottle by “23 souls who now shall go to
our long last sleep.” As a matter of fact,
the Loch Torridon sank very slowly—like
the London long ago—and the crew were
all rescued by a passing steamer. Six months
later their obituary message reached shore
-—and then the crew almost wished they
were dead. The moral is that, though you
can write your own obituary notice if you
like, it is a mistake to publish it until you
have definitely shaken hands with the under-
taker.
One Melbourne daily traced even the elec-
tion of John Haynes to Germany :
A feeling has arisen in Sydney that the German
vote is favorable to Labor. . . .and a feeling of hos-
tility to the Government and the party behind it is
every day growing.
Well, if the “German” vote (supposing
there be such a thing big enough to be
appreciable) is cast for the State Govern-
ment that was guilty of the Norton Griffiths
iniquity, it will anyhow prove that naturali-
sation robs the German of intelligence.
“W.A.R.”: The problem of the war at
this stage is how to get a human being
safely over a few hundred yards of shell- and
bullet-swept ground. The opposing trenches
have always some space of unoccupied
territory lying between them. In Gallipoli,
as Bean told us recently, it is sometimes
only from 15 to 20 yards across. Yet the
Australian Light Horse, fighting as infan-
try, were unable to cover the distance alive.
The attack was fortunately stopped before
the third line went out; the preceding lines
had all been mowed down by a sickle of
lead. This slaughter was necessary, we
are told, in order to keep the Turks tethered
to their positions while they were needed
elsewhere as reinforcements. But there are
other ways to cover that fatal 100 yards.
Is it not possible for the soldiers to advance
behind armor? Cannot some inventive Aus-
tralian devise a steel turtle that can be
pushed forward by a few men, safe from
the hail of lead? A score of such turtles,
fitted with appliances for cutting wire
entanglements, and each containing (sayi
half a dozen protected soldiers, would land
a platoon of Australians alive at the Turk-
ish trenches, and after that the Australians
could be left to finish the business. The
time for the turtle would be slow, but the
men would get there whole. And it is just
the ability to get there complete that is
needed. Any disabled turtle might be pulled
back, with its wounded, by the tail; and
spikes could be fixed on the beast’s head in
case any tired Turk wanted to sit on it.
“Jean Sibi”: Why not abolish the salute?
It is a tacit recognition of. caste, hallowed
ny long sufferance among professional war-
riors, but degrading and redundant in citi-
zen armies where the barrister and bottle-oh
fight alike in the ranks. To me, however,
its most objectionable feature is that it is
absurdly time-wasting, Consider the num-
ber of bent backs brought to attention and
the line of grimy hands held stiffly to _ the
brow when an officer encounters fatigue
parties at work. Add the wasted energy
of the many privates who will cut to any
cover to avoid putting up their hands to
their superiors. Australians have an in-
stinctive repugnance to the salute, and the
wise officer is as blind as discipline permits
to his subordinates’ shortcomings in this
respect. One of the most unpopular Sol-
diers in Victoria is a camp commandant
who sternly insists on the performance of
the four-fjnger exercise. Two or three raw
recruits Who disputed his ruling more .in
ignorance thail in auger (they had been on
duty most of the night and were almost too
tired to notice the Great Man passing) were
hurriedly bundled into the guard tent. A
similar breach of military observance by
another batch Cost each criminal £l, while
the young officer nominally responsible for
two of them was told that if further cases
occurred he would be relieved. The heat
and mental profanity engendered by these
proceedings, not to mention the unnecessary
punishment inflicted in a military court
assuming the solemn flummery of civil law,
would condemn the salute in the eyes of good
democrats, if the practice were not already
damned as a mere ornamental tribute to
military johnnies whose importance has
already been too much swollen. Without it
there would be greater discipline, mutual
resnect. and good feeling between the ranker
and his boss; and the military rooster’s
precious dignity need not be one feathenfrless
than it is now. .

BAD FOR THE SKIN.
It is not a good thing for persons who
have a tendency to skin trouble, such as
pimples and rashes,, to use cosmetics and
ointments of a greasy nature. In many
cases such things have been known to
aggravate the trouble. They stop up the
pores of the skin, preventing healthy per-
spiration and giving rise to blackheads that
are much complained of. The general health
must be looked to and any error of diet or
habit corrected. As the condition of the
blood is largely involved in all skin rashes,
the patient would do well to try a course of
the well-known Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills, as
they have given good results in many forms
of skin trouble. They make rich, new blood
that drives out the impurities and imparts
a glow of health. They increase the appe-
tite and energy, and correct any condition
that, arises from a deficient state of the
blood- These pills can be had wherever
medicine is sold.

the Blood,” will he sent on application to

Correcting Bad Breath.
Bad breath is extremely unpleasant to
those around the subject of the trouble.
Bad teeth is a cause of offensive breath, and
the trouble abates when the teeth are
attended to. Constipation and a disordered
stomach are, however, more frequently the
cause. To correct constipation. Pinkettes,
the new laxative, should be taken. They are
designed to correct the stomach conditions
which cause these symptoms ; regulate the
liver and remove constipation. Pinkettes
act without causing .sickness or griping or
the bad after-effects of strong purgatives.

Catarrh. It is an exceedingly dangerous com-
plaint, and is so insidious that the sufferer hardly
realises how serious is his or her condition until
matters have reached an almost chronic stage.
' With acold in the head ’ fj ut it never stops there.
The simple cold becomes a protracted one, while the discharge from the
nose grows more profuse and uncomfortable. *
The inflammation extends to the throat and bronchial tubes causing
hoarseness a tickling sensation and an aggravating cough. The matter
that is continually dropping back into the throat finds its wav into the
KS.S’Sgir d,slres,i,lg lorm of mus.B. and l„ s8 „f
The catarrha l poisons are absorbed into the blood, and all the membranes
of the body become infected. What was supposed to be a purely local
disease has become constitutional, deep-seated. and chronic, and may
eventuany result in Deafness, Bronchitis, Asthma, Neuritis, Catarrh of
the Stomach, or that dread scourge of the human race, Consumption.

ALL women are agreed upon the de-
lightful feeling of confidence that
tomes of being well-dressed in even-
respect—gown, gloves, shoes—every detail
correct.
Bostock Shoes therefore, which are in
the first rank of Fashion, renowned for
their elegance of design and graceful
modelling, and as comfortable' as heart
can desire, are certain to find favor with
those women who care about all the
details of dress.
New shipments are constantly arrivin'*
at the leading stores, and should be irn
spected at once ere the most attractive
styles are sold. The name Bostock is
stamped on the soles of every pair.

ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS.
No notice (except of a hostile character) will be
taken of communications insufficiently stamped.
Name and address mtist appear on the MSS. No
liability is undertaken re contributions volun-
tarily submitted j and no MS. will be returned
unless stamps accompany.
Wm. H.j Two months ago last Sabbath
afternoon “Warrior Immortal’’ was reverently laid
to rest in the office tomb. A penny stamp may
secure resurrection, though when MS. isn’t accom-
panied by stamps for return it- is usually taken as
a hint that no Gabriel’s trump is wanted....
A.W.H.: Reprint matter of no use to us; but we
want original paragraphs from everywhere. And
what we print we want to pay for Old Sydney-
ite: Thanks, but don't think there is much in it.
Wi: “Spring” gay trifle, with a pretty facility
of rhyme; but hardly the weight. .. .Merton: Your
tank would hold 16,020 cubic fdet of beer or any
other necessary commodity—so near 100,000 Imperial
gallons of it that the difference doesn’t matter....
Zak: The story was not accepted... .J.P.: The
U.S.A. did not sign the Belgian scrap-o’-paper. . ..
Ivaoota: It has no sparkle, and the dosser has been
worked out for all but the best writers. Impossible
to advise you without knowing what your capa-
bilities are, and what sort of presswork you have
in mind... .Lestor: Quite enough mystery, but not
enough explanation Boona Blue: You don’t pump
any originality into it Nicolas B.: We don’t
know you so well that we yearn to pay excess post-
age on your contribution. It wasn’t much of a
contribution, either Bellerive: Glad to see there
is no reference to the war in it:—•
D.E.S. :■ Hardly enough in it Cangai: Freeze
some other curate’s blood with it... .G.A.G.: All
corners and rough edges R.A.M.: He is a poet as
well as a statistician. Beware lest he turn and
smash you with a sonnet E.lt.M.: Three days’
fatigue for being a dull soldier. ... L.F.Y.: Both
lose on points. . . .O.D. (MX.) : Of no use to us, and
you didn t stick its return fare on its paper chest.
Y. (M.L.) : Promising, but too slight. And
next time attach name and address to MS....Wat
L. B.: You haven’t the literary punch.... Frank B.:
Well below print level, and contrast strongly with
your other contribution—the one we inquired about.
G.J.M.: Pleasant, jog-trot rhymes. No value
here... .Harold J.: You say too many things twice,
and you say nothing very we 11.... Jason: When the
German considers his own intelligent system of uni-
versal training and service, and alongside it sets a
system of volunteering which is so slack that the
flapper gets to work with white feathers, do you
wonder that he still thinks he has a hope? It's
not what he is doing—it is what we are not doing
that encourages him....G.1.K.: Quite true that all
those four names were passed by the Censor in Mel-
bourne and printed there. But, you see, Von Hin-
denberg and the Crown Prince and Mackensen don’t
take the Melbourne papers. They only read papers
printed in Sydney. So what can be published with
safety on one side of the Murray would simply burst
up the whole business if it were published on the
other. You shouldn’t complain. You should be very-
thankful that we have an Intelligence Department
which finds out such interesting things. .. .L.F.Y.:
If half a dozen of these pages could be made into
ten, “Woman Smith’’., would get a hearing. As things
are, she misses by a nose Sep: 20 to I—the same
price that you can get about vour- ability to raise
any particular number you want on a Sydney auto-
matic telephone... .London: Impossible to give
figures; but there is no doubt in the world that,
including British investments in railway and other
such cos. in America; America owes Britain vastly
more than Britain owes America.
TO AUTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
Frank K.: Not what we want.... V.: Well, well!
Fancy anybody trying to work that gag off after
all these years 1... . J.D.8.: The originator of the
idea did a cartoon on ihe same lines.
“Hori” : I watched the second contingent
of Maoris go-Jjtft of .Auckland for the Front
—very sad at leaving their homes and their
people. These natives are sentimental and
filled with strong a flection- for their own
tolk; and their soldier representatives are
nearly all mere boys of barely 21. One of
tlie most impressive things I’ve heard in
this war was the crooning of a company of
them as , into, camp from night
manoeuvres. After a couple of silent hours
they “found relief tor “their pent-up " feelings
by singing the haunting love-songs of their
people. Long before they could be seen from
the camp their voices, soft and musical,
could be heard in tunes that were half
chants, half lullabies. It is a big test of the
Maori’s loyalty to ask him to send his young
men away, and grief holds sway in many a
pa and kainga where the women cannot
understand why their sons should go across
the water to fight, yet seem to realise in a
vague sort of way that the Maori’s maria is
somehow involved. Some, drawing no con-
solation from that, have decided that their
lads have gone never to re,turn —and what is
for them who are left but to die? The
Maori still retains the ability to go out like
that, and some are bound to do it. The
next contingent in training will consist of
the even more primitive Niue Islanders and
Itaratongans, with a few Maoris to make up
the tally.
If is cabled that not only has Germany’s
trade with India been captured by Japan,
which has dumped enormous quantities of
goods there since the war started, but that
India’s industrial independence is so
threatened by the brown ma.x_.that Indian
manufacturers are seeking direct Govern-
ment intervention. It is satisfactory to
reflect that''nothing "like that" can happen to
the Commonwealth because of that Protec-
tive tariff which Andrew Fisher promised
Australia last August.
AFTER THE BALL.
You are jealous of my cousin,
Exclaimed a woman young and gay,
When from her lawful husband
She angrily drew away ;
Amidst the strains of music
He sauntered from the hall
Out into the silent night
From the glitter of the Ball.
From that night the sea did roll-eth
Between the husband and his Wife
Which weaved a fatal shadow
Which early closed her life ;
By her grave did sadlv kneeleth
A man a grey arid tall—
Two lives for ever parted
By the glitter of a Ball.

ELECTRIC
FAN
f)o good, quick, clean Ironing.
You can iron in any room in the house —or on the porch—with a G-E
Electric Iron. Attach it to any light socket, turn the switch and the G-E
Iron is ready in a moment.
Aside from these conveniences, think of the time, money and steps a
G-E Iron saves. Think of the lessened wear and tear on the family linen.
With a G=E Electric Iron you get “ Even Heat.”
EVEN HEAT
No Spot too Hot
No spot too hot; it is no hotter at the point than at the
heel —at the edges than in the centre. This safeguards
against scorches—makes the ironing go quicker and
easier; saves time, which means saving electricity; in
fact
An Average Family Ironing costs
only Threepence for Electricity.
Specially-arranged air chambers in .the G-E Iron hold
the heat down directly to the ironing surface. Using
the heat this way also permits you to do considerable
ironing with the electricity turned off.
The G-E trademark on this iron stands for quality—it assures you
lifetime of satisfactory service.
Banish hot=weather Discomfort.
Turn the switch and command the faintest zephyr, or a sweeping
breeze —as you please—and it shall be yours—in home, office, bedroom,
ballroom or workshop. A simple device places the speed entirely within
your control.
Twenty years of laboratory study and factory application are concen-
trated in the smooth-running, noiseless mechanism of the G-E Electric Fan.
Its Oscillating Motion,
silently stirring the air—like the breeze flow of nature —is only one of the
many practical features of this fan.
Its sturdiness of construction, the perfect integrity of its materials and
parts, its delicacy of balance throughout, which prevents vibration and wear,
all assure you a lifetime of satisfactory service.
As to Economy, sufficient to say that the G-E Fan, depending on the
size, can be run
Seven or Eight Hours for One Penny
—less than the cost of burning a single ordinary incandescent light.
G-E Fans are made in many sizes and styles for use in homes, stores,
offices, hotels, restaurants and factories. Any desired finish to match
surroundings may be ordered.

IN BANANA LAND
Hardaere, of the Education Department,
in place of abolishing home lessons as threat-
ened, has merely done the unnecessary and
left the necessary undone. He has restricted
the tasks in the junior classes, where they
were quite innocuous; but he has done
nothing with regard to the inordinate cram-
ming of scholarship examinees, which has
been, and still is, most injurious.
C. R. Gregory, who takes Costin’s place
as Clerk of the Legislative Council, and thus
becomes also Clerk of Parliaments, is the son
of C. R. Gregory, for so many years Queens-
land Government Printer. The new man is
alert and brainy, with the Standing Orders
all at his fingers’ ends—as becomes a pupil
of the very capable Costin.
Premier Ryan has thrown down the
gauntlet to the Leg. Council. The Work-
men’s Compensation Bill, just passed by
the Assembly, proposes to establish a State
monopoly in Industrial Insurance. As two-
thirds of the House of Profound Slumber
are directors, shareholders or solicitors of
insurance companies, the old chaps threat-
ened to emasculate or turn down the Bill;
whereupon Hamilton, the Labor rep., spoke
seriously of a referendum about the aboli-
tion of the Council. The Courier of course
backs up the Council; but as the Courier’s
advocacy is always disastrous there is not
much comfort in that.
“Mulga” : Following on the report of the
Land Court upon the Jimbour Estate, the
Minister for Lands has got permission from
the House to introduce a Bill to alter the
tenure of the farms: which simply means
that the land will be made cheaper to the
selector, and the taxpayer will have to pay
the balance. Originally purchased by the
squatter for a mere bagatelle, the land was
resumed by the Crown at an average price
of £3 10s. per acre, the total purchase money
being £423,713. On being thrown open,
three-quarters of the area was selected at a
gross £364,076. Returns from all sources
so far have been only £57,436. According
to the Land Court the selectors are broke
on account of the dry seasons. But other
things helped. For instance, the Laud
Appeal Court sat 43 days valuating the
land for resumption purposes, and the cost
of this was passed on to the selector; also
the cost, of the thousands of posts which
were lying in Macalister railway yard for
months, and which, being then found totally
unfit for fencing purposes, were finally used
as fuel. Summarised, both the selector and
the taxpayer must now pay heavily for the
inflation of the value of the land. Some of
this was the ordinary- inflation which pro-
ceeds from every borrowing boom ; and some
more"was the result of a special adver-
tising campaign conducted with the object of
suggesting that a (garden of Eden flourished
in what in reality is much more like a
Desert of Sahara.
Passed out a few days ago Russell 11.
Ralston, of Rotham Park, Cairns. Ral-
ston, a squatter of the old breed, managed
successively and successfully Miranda and
Glengyle stations, with Roxmere and Cork in
the Far North, and of late had acted as
managing-director for Ralston Bros. He left
no family; but his repute in the West as
being one of the most reasonable and hospit-
able of the old squatting crowd will not van-
ish in a day.
The inquiry into the running of the Goodna
Mental Hospital will go down to history as
the Great Bug Investigation. The habits of
the local Norfolk Howard; his defiance of
kerosene, turpentine and other alleged ex-
terminators ; his numerousness on the persons
of inmates, and his assaults upon visitors ;
his powers of reproduction—-all were fully
ventilated. Occasionally a gleam of humor
lit up the Commission’s labors, as when an
official solemnly deposed that the insects
were always more venomous after a visit of
his Honor the President.
“McVolt”: Here in Rockhampton 25.000
people have pitched camp on a flat. The
city supply of two very necessary commodi-
ties, gas and electricity, is in the hands of
one co. The price of gas per thousand feet
is 10s.; of electric current Is. per unit. I
will enter the last-mentioned as a record for
Australia, and would be glad to have the
name of any town in the world that beats
it. Moreover, even at that price, electricity
is available in only the four main streets,
and new consumers are refused a supply.
It’s a fine thing to have Labor Governments
in command. See how they get to work at
once on essentials!
Concerning a Queensland prickly pear :
Foreman, the Rockhampton grocer who is against
compulsory training and many other things (B.
23/9/’l5), is a fine specimen of the imported English
Nonconformist Conscience. With its wider spaces and
easier life it has so far been impossible for Aus-
tralia to produce anything quite like that Conscience.
Fanatical, zealous, warped in judgment and pitiless,
towards those who hold other opinions, this self-
righteous people is the most constant political power
in England. Once decided that it is right (and it
would never suspect that it is wrong), all the
shrapnel and high explosives in Flanders will never
STILL NIBBLING.
shift it. Edward Foreman is an interesting example
of his class. Arriving in Rockhampton in the ’BO s,
he found it a town on which the ancient squatter
regime had so left its mark that nobody who was
anybody ever paid cash; and as keeping up social
appearances weighed most with everybody who
was anybody, the despicable tradespeople very
frequently did not get paid at all. Fore-
man started in an old weatherboard barn
at the lower end of East-street, and let it be known
that he sold cheap and for cash and for cash
only. It shocked, horrified and generally shattered
high society, which set in to tame the revolutionist.
But he refused to be tamed. One yarn current was
of the wife of a clerical dignitary who had kept
enough cash at home to pay for her order on delivery,
but had forgotten a bar of soap. She told the carter
she would call in and pay next day. He explained
that his instructions were very definite, and he must
take the bar of soap back. The lady burst in upon
Foreman with a request that the offending carter
should be sacked, pointing out that it was only a
matter of a few pence in an order of gever'aispbunds.
“Madam,” said the grocer with the Nonconformist
Conscience, “if he had not brought back the bar of
soap I should have discharged him. But I will never
punish a man for following- my instructions.” The lady
notified him that she would never deal there again,
and was informed that he never expected anyone to
deal there if it wasn’t profitable to do so. Society
in Rockhampton went into a paroxysm of rage over
the matter. “The impudence of the man,” etc., etc.
Yet inside of two months the lady had capitulated;
and gradually all “Rocky” gave in. Foreman’s suc-
cess set a revolution going in trade circles in the
city of the three S’s; and business remains on a
reasonably solid basis to-this day.
His Ex. Goold-Adams, who was once ruler
in Orange River Free State, tells a yarn of
how a Dutch farmer who was driving him
home from a local show wanted to know why
he was leaving so fine a country. “Why not
stay and take up farming?” he asked. Adams
replied that he was getting too old for sheep-
worrying. “Might do worse,” said the Boer,
“than stay here and marry.” “But whom
would I marry?” “Well, there’s my mother-
in-law,” saM the Dopper. “She’s nearly as
good looking as my wife.” '
“McNorth” introduces a missioner who
pursues Satan over the horizon: —
Besides being- one of the best-liked men in the
Far North, W. M. Wilkinson, of the Bush Brother-
hood, who was mentioned in a recent Bulletin, is
also one of the hardest doers. Although 62 years of
age, and, on account of deafness, compelled to carry
a hearing apparatus, he has just completed a trip
which deserves a place in the annals of exploration.
With 19 horses and two black-boys he overlanded from
Cooktown to some of the most out-lying parts .of the
Northern Territory, and back again. He covered
some thousands of miles, and the jaunt occupied two
years. On account of bad seasons and long, dry
stretches, be suffered many privations, but the plucky
Old chap has come through smiling. And all in
order to carry a cheery word and tidings of the
outer world to the pioneers who live their lonely
lives in the Far Away places. Wilkinson doesn’t
reckon distance a drawback in the ordinary sense of
the word. He once announced his intention of going
to the Pascoe River, away up near Cape York. He
was advised not to go, as there were only two men
there. But he said that that was all the more reason
why he should go. In fact, he would go if there was
only one man there. And off he started on the long-
journey. Those two Pascoe River miners will always
remember that visit of the cheerful bush missioner.
They had been out of tobacco for some weeks, and
Wilkinson had a spare pound in his pack-bags.
“P.P.” : In wasting time the State offices
can hold their own with the Postal Depart-
ment. Here is an instance. A selector in
Central Bananaland paid a cheque into the
local land office, which wrote forwarding
the document to head office, Brisbane. Head
office wrote (1) to local office acknowledg-
ing receipt; (2) to selector demanding six-
pence exchange. Selector keeps quiet. Head
office again writes him, having the honor
to direct his attention, etc. Selector replies
that he doesn’t owe sixpence, having paid
it to the local office. Frenzied correspond-
ence between the two offices about sixpence,
each side writing fre-
quently to selector, the
badgered cocky finally
sendjng another six-
pence to the local
office and praying for
an armistice. Mean-
while head office had
got Ministerial sanc-
tion to pay itself six-
pence out of petty
cash, and was just
ruling off the various
entries and filing all
the papers when news
arrived from the local
office that a second
sixpence had been
paid and the first six-
pence located. This
hit red tape fair in
the solar plexus, and
frantic letter-writing
ensued regarding the
way to act in emer-
gencies of this kind,
and finally the settler
was informed that if he proceeded to Bris-
bane before noon on a, certain date ; and
lodged proof of claim and identity the price
of a beer would be his.
Again the long arm. Died the other day
Mr. and Mrs. T. King, old and well-kpown
Brisbane residents, within a few hours of
each other, of the same trouble—bronchitis.
Years ago Mr. King’s parents also passed out
on the same day.
Ex-Senator St. Ledger, now numbered
among the stuffed lions of Liberalism, is
still in politics, though not in Parliament.
He is settled at Toorak (Vic.), and takes a
small share in the obscure doings of' the
People’s Party, with an occasional appear-
ance at the drawing-room entertainments of
the Women’s National League.
Brisbane Courier says “the war has made
flesh dear everywhere.” Not everywhere.
A recent cable mentioned that young Arme-
nian girls, captured by the Unspeakable, are
fetching Bs. 6d. a head in Constantinople;
extra plump, 9s. 6d.
Died of pneumonia and buried at sea on
the way from Anzac to Alexandria, Major
Richards, who left a big practice at Mount
Morgan to go to Gallipoli. He was in
charge of the Anzac Beach hospital from
May to July, when he contracted his fatal
illness. Major Richards graduated at Syd-
ney in 1893, and his youngest son did the
same this year. He, too, has left for the
Dardanelles.
Sniping.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
A Turkish girl recently captured was a skilful
sniper and had secured 50 identification discs. — Cable.
Down in the treheh was a Turkish girl,
Picking us off in turn ;
Under the cloud of the smoky whirl,
How did her dark eyes burn!
More than one of her Christian foes
Fell with a deadly smart,
Well we knew that her aim was true
Right on a good man’s heart.
Caught at last was the Moslem girl,
Winged ; and a trooper bold
Brought her in, while a raven curl
Over the white brow rolled;
Fifty discs of the men she’d dropped
Hung at her neck of snow,
Fifty pounds of the gold she’d snared
Hid in her tunic low.
Ev’ry sniper is sniped in turn
(Listen, O sniping crew),
Whether she snipe with a rifle brown
Or with her eyes of blue ;
AYhether she aim from a vantage dim
Back i’ the Turkish line ;
Whether she shoot in a garden trim
Under a shady vine.
Celia, let me a question put:
When you are taking aim
Fair at the breast of a hapless youth,
What is your rightful name?
Under the guise of a maiden cold
Are you a sniper, too?
Under the heave of your lacy fold
How many discs have you?
QUEENSLAND.
F. BORN.
QUEENSLAND GOSSIP.
Brisbane, October 2, 1915.
My Dear Thargomindah,—■-
This has been a drab week. The races
to-day brought out only about 20 well-dressed
women, in spite of the fact that the Excel-
lencies were present. Lady Goold-Adams
wore navy blue, a shade also favored by little
Miss Ross Munro and Mrs. Whittingham,
who occupied stools in the vice-regal box.
Nurse Trixie Dunn, who returned a few
days ago-with a batch of wounded Queens-
landers, has left for Sydney, on the way back
to Egypt, where she will be welcomed with
glad coo-ees.
The billycan scheme is working well.
Every day Mrs. Spencer Browne and her
lieutenants gather at the depot in the
Courier buildings, and hand out billies and
plum puddings. The latter are made to lit
the billies, so the committee keeps, them in
stock; but all other presents that are billjed
have to be purchased elsewhere. If preferred,
live shillings handed over the counter will
send a full pot to a soldier anywhere at
the Front. It’s a cheap way for a citizen
to obtain a happy Christmas.
Another Christmas comfort fund is doing
good work. The Cowley lady sits in the
chief chair at the committee meetings, and
Margaret Dalrymple, whose sister is busy in
a hospital in Egypt, is the secretary. This
committee is not rushing forward its material
good wishes. Its little lot will arrive when
the other little lots have been finished.
To-night the Exhibition Hall was crowded
for a concert to help the Railway ward at
the Military Hospital. The edifying part
of the programme included songs by Mrs.
Gilbert Wilson, handsome in emerald green,
and contralto Lena Hammond, in a cream
lace gown with touches of coral; selections
by Mrs. Harry Reeve’s mandolin club and
items by Mr. Schleusener and Tessie Mul-
cahy.
Another concert tuned up on Wednesday
night at Palace Gardens. This was in aid
of the Hamilton branch of the Red Cross
Society, and was arranged by Zora Cross.
A small girl named Ruth Arnold, who re-
cited a piece entitled “Gallipoli,” written
by Miss Cross, was the star-bud of the
evening. “The Mothers,” a playlet by Arthur
Adams, also recompensed the audience for
risking its money.
Rita MacLeod (“Margaret Fleming”) has
just brought out another volume of verse.
Although but a girl-sprig this is Miss
MacLeod’s second offence, and Queenslanders
begin to refer to her with pride.
The women who inaugurated the sock fund
in Queensland have 7000 reasons to feel
pleased with themselves. Already that many
pairs of foot gloves have been addressed to
Tommy Bananaland. The supply will be
kept up so long as the war lasts.
Dr. and Mrs. Leavy, too popular Northern-
ers, who have been visiting England, re-
turned home last week.
QUITE THE 'REVERSE.
SHE: “(Sniff, sniff) I wouldn't .have (sniff)
ever married you (sniff) if I had known
(sniff) that dr-rink was one of your
failings.”
HE: “ Failingsh ! (Hic) Who th' devilsh
shaid that? Why, it'sh my greatesht
shukshesh!”
An exhibition of war curios and Egyptian
odds and ends is to be held in Dalgety’s
Buildings on Thursday, Friday and Satur-
day. Lady Goold-Adams has promised to
unlock the doors. The cash will go to the
Soldiers’ Help Society.
.Yjjurs affectionately,
AUSTRALIA JANE.

"■pHE STATE EXPRESS CIGARETTES forcibly refute
the dictum that high quality necessarily means a high
price. The Ardath Tobacco Co., Ltd., are more than delighted
to be able to offer these remarkable cigarettes to the .Australian
consumers
When we were first commissioned by a good many business
friends in Australia to produce a Virginia cigarette of a high-
class quality to be sold at
lO - 6d. 20 - 1/-
50 - 2/6 100 - 5/-
we had it strongly impressed upon us that something special
was essential.
So we concentrated our efforts on creating a' cigarette
possessing that note of distinction which is characteristic of
“State Express” itself.
WE SUCCEEDED.

something different —something better than you* have ever

FOR
GREY
HAIR.
BEFORE THE MIRROR.
By “ JEANNETTE.*
•‘Jeannette,” the well-known writer on Beauty Culture and author ot “The Book ot Beauty,*
will be pleased to help arid advise any reader on matters of the toilet. Queries should be accom-
panied by a stamped addressed envelope, and directed to “Jeannette,” c/o “Before the Mirror,”
43 Gray’s Inn Road, London, W.C., England.
These are, undoubtedly, days of exceptional nervous strain for one and all of
us. Anxiety, with its beauty-destroying influence, is casting its shadow over the
lives of many of us women, and while, perhaps, a few—the more stoical amongst
us—can avoid worrying over past and prospective events, we may all, with a little
care and foresight, succeed in preventing the results of worry from being notice-
able in our appearance. To these fortunate few this little chat will, however, be
as interesting and instructive as to those w'ho stand in real need of help in toilet
matters, and may be the means of bringing to their notice some hitherto unknown
method of retaining, or regaining, that beauty of face and figure which is the birth-
right of every woman. Some of the ingredients mentioned below are, at present,
not generally known to the public, but any good chemist will usually be found to
have a small quantity in stock.
Wrinkles, and How to Remove them.—Worry,
late hours, or the passing of old Father Time
may cause those ugly little lines which so
detract from the freshness and charm of a
woman’s face; hut the cure is always the
same. Feed the tissues beneath the skin, and
massage them with a reliable skin food,
which, while nourishing the fatty tissues,
will not coarsen the skin nor grow hairs upon
the face, as so many inferior creams do. To
remove the wrinkles bathe the face with hot
water, wipe it dry; then, while it is still
warm, smear a little mercolised wax over the
whole face, carrying it well down on the neck,
and, with the tips of the lingers, rub it gently
into the pores, working in an upward and
outward direction. Wipe off any superfluous
wax, leaving a little on the skin all night.
In the morning wash off with waim water
and Pilenta soap. The use of the wax not
only feeds the skin but removes the dead,
duter cuticle, giving the fresh, young skin
beneath an opportunity to breathe and show
itself.
Beautiful Hair—How to Shampoo.—Whether
the hair is luxuriant and glossy, or thin and
lanky, depends very largely upon the care
bestowed upon it. To keep the hair in good
condition it should be shampooed once in
every two or three weeks. Before shampooing
massage a little pure olive oil or almond oil
into the scalp, then mix one teaspoonful of
stallax granules in a cup of hot water, till a
basin with warm water, into which the ends
of the hair can fall, and shampoo the stallax
mixture into the scalp in the usual way.
Rinse, arm dry by fanning with a palm fan,
or in the open air, if the weather permits.
Should the hair be naturally very greasy, the
oil massage should be omitted. Stallax can
be bought at any chemist’s in nuarter-pound
sealed packages: it keeps indefinitely, and one
one package contains sufficient for twenty-five
or thirty shampoos.
The Question of Powder. —Powder should
never be used by anyone with a tendency to
wrinkle, for it fills up the lines on the face,
and tends to deepen and accentuate the wrin-
kles. In the place of powder, get about one
ounce of cleminite from any chemist, and dis-
solve it in four tablespoons of warm water.
Place it in a bottle, and apply to the skin with
the finger tips, allowing it to dry on the face.
This gives the skin a soft, peach-like bloom,
and prevents that unbecoming, greasy appear-
ance which is the bane of many a woman’s
life.
A Tonic for the Hair. —During the spring and
early summer, the hair generally needs a little
stimulant to its growth, in the form of a
tonic. To make a simple and inexpensive one.
at home, take four ounces of bay rum, and
add to it one ounce of boranium. Shake thor-
oughly, and leave for thirty minutes, then
strain, and add sufficient water to make half
a pint. At night, massage the scalp for ten
mnutes. then dab the mixture into the roots
with a soft sponge. Five minutes’ brusbiti-
in the morning will be found beneficial in giv-
ing an added gloss to the hair
To Wave the Hair. —Hot irons, when employed
to wave the liair, not only make it harsh and
brittle, spoiling color of fair or auburn hair,
but induce a tendency towards greyness. To
give a wave to straight hair, damp it with
silmerine and either plait, tying the ends, or
arrange in waving pins for a short time. A
couple of ounces will last quite a long time.
A Greasy Skin and Blackheads. —Blackheads
are absolutely fatal to beauty, for they give a
coarse, dirty look to the face which no cos
metics can ever hide. The way to remove
blackheads quickly and effectively has only
recently been discovered. For many years
those who suffered in this way were restricted
in their diet, denied sweets, and had to suffer
other privations. Modern science has, how
ever, provided a simple, effective and quick
remedy. Dissolve one stymol tablet in a glass
of hot water, and when the effervescence has
subsided, dip a small, soft sponge into the
liquid, and bathe the face. Leave for a few
minutes, then dry with a towel, and the black-
heads will come off. For a greasy skin, bathe
the face three times a week with stymol, and
spray with cold water every morning, using a
vulcanite throat spray.
To Reduce the Figure.—With the present
fashions, even more than with the tight skirts,
it is imperative that the woman who wishes to
look smart should be slim. To reduce one's
weight without injuring one’s health is no
easy matter, and can only be done by taking
some specific which will counteract the natural
tendency towards putting on flesh. A few
clynol berries, eaten regularly, will speedily
transform the fat, ungainly figure into one of
slim and graceful proportions, without any in
convenience whatever, and in a very short
time. Clynol berries are quite pleasant to the
taste, having a marked peppermint flavor.
To Restore Grey Hair to its Original Color. —
Streaks of grey, whether in fair or dark hair,
are always unbecoming, and prove a cruel tell-
tale of age. It is not generally known that
an ounce of tammalite, which can be bought
at any chemist’s, mixed with four ounces ol
bay rum, makes a most satisfactory lotion for
restoring grey hair to its natural color. Apply
the lotion night and morning with a soft
toothbrush, and, after a few- days, the hair
will be found to be gradually returning to its
original shade.
Superfluous Hair —its Cause and Cure.—Super-
fluous hair is invariably the result of using
inferior soap or bad face creams. To remove
the hairs, apply a little powdered pheminol
mixed to a paste with cold water and applied
to the skin with a bone knife. The skin
should be dusted with powdered alum before
applying the pheminol. and the paste removed
after being left on for tw r o minutes. This
treatment is recommended not only to remove
the growth temporarily, but to eventually kill
•die roots. f 2
YOU can see Berger's Paints defying
the weather, protecting and pre-
serving—as well as beautifying the surface
—on many big buildings, amongst others
The Intercolonial Building, Riley’s
Building, Challis Building, and Bernard’s
Building—all in Sydney. Why were
Berger’s Paints used on these big jobs ?
—and doesn’t it suggest that when you
are having your property painted, you too
would secure longest preservation at least
cost by asking your painter to use
Berger s Paints ?

Adelaide University, through Chapman.,
its professor of engineering, and Rogers, its
instrument-maker, lias given to the military
a new infantry range-finder that looks good.
The old ones were either heavy and cumber-
some or, if of pocket size, apt to be highly
complicated and made in Germany. The
Professor—most modest of men —thinks he
lias proved his simple little arrangement of
mirrors accurate up to two miles; and he
hopes it will “prove of some little use in due
time.”
Commenting on the shortage of shells,
which came very near sending the Allies
under, Nat Harper, of Westralia, told the
Argus on his return from Siberia: “The
worst of it is that Russia is not a manufac-
turing nation.”- And the Argus mourns
with Harper. It seems necessary to remind
them both that no country starts its manu-
factures with munitions. The ability to
produce toys, motor-cars and jute-goods has
made it possible for Germany to turn out
machine-guns and aeroplanes; and, while
Grandmamma beams on the importers of
Japanese toys, Indian jute, American motor-
cars and such articles which should be manu-
factured here, just so much influence is being
exerted against the local equipment of the
Australian army.
G.-G. Ferguson, an expert in the matter,
talking in Adelaide about the awful waste
of Australian timber and the need for
turning local brains to the question of
reafforestation:—
What we want is not to import foresters from
Great Britain, France or India, but to train men
in Australia who would be able to produce the best
results under Australian conditions. Our people should
realise that practically all the timber now from the
Baltic, Canada and Japan can be grown equally well
here. This country has an advantage in timber-
growing over .the European countries —the forest
matures in. half the time: 30 years as against 60
years.
And what the Commonwealth also wants is
Federal action. If each State is left to
take independent action or no action at all
the preservation of the timber we have and
the planting of what we haven’t got will
continue to be more honored in the speech
than the observance.
Adelaide has just finished driving the
tunnel, about a mile long, which will let
the Torrens overflow in to the new Mill-
brook reservoir. Works Minister Jackson,
Hydraulic-Engineer Bayer, and a batch of
officials and pressmen had the glory of wad-
ing half-way through, seeing the last blast,
and then scrambling on to the inlet end,
15 miles above the city. The cost was a
trifling £40.000; the time taken, a year; the
capacity, 250 million gallons a day. This
addition to Adelaide’s three existing reser-
voirs is to make it feel comfortable even if
last year’s record dryness should ever again
be experienced; and it no doubt will actu-
ally be all right until the city again out-
grows its present plans. Incidentally, the
driving of this Millbrook tunnel was so wet
a job that the springs encountered made
a useful help to the city’s supplies from last
Christmas onwards.
Westralia’s Labor Government recently
tried to get a steamer made in England to
carry chilled meat from Wyndham to Fre-
mantle, but no one would undertake delivery
until at least 12 months after the end of
the war. _ As this was considered too long
to wait it was decided, on the advice of
Biles, the naval architect, to secure a twin-
screw Densel-engined boat. Until the freez-
ing works are finished this vessel is to be
used to carry Westralian produce to London
and bring Government material and general
cargo back. Subsequently she will be
switched on to the Wyndham run, and a
more up-to-date ship will carry frozen meat
from Wyndham to London. But State-
owned steamers in the West have so rarely
been used for what they were bought for
that jt is just as likely these two will be
carrying beer and sundries to Spitzbergen
inside five years.
A Melbourne man makes a suggestion for
turning the war to closer-settlement account
in a small way. He offers to give two 10-
acre blocks to returned soldiers, “if 50 other
property-owners will do likewise” ; funds to
be raised by a managing committee for the
purp ;se of fencing, ploughing and planting
the blocks, providing “some stock” and build-
ing a couple of n oms or more for the re-
turned warriors. Doubtless there is joy in
Heaven over this philanthropic proposition;
ah the same. Heaven had better first find out
what sort of land is comprised within the
10-acre patches, and somebody else might
then find out whether the returned soldiers
know what to do with the patches when they
are settled on them. The idea that farming
is an unskilled trade has cost Australia so
much money and so many ruined lives that
the sooner it is looked at suspiciously the
better.
.Melbourne City Council is still coquetting
with the old question of what to do with
its slums. At a recent meeting its legis-
lative committee submitted a memorandum
to the effect that the Council had no autho-
rity to compulsorily acquire any property,
slum or otherwise, except for the purpose
of erecting workers’ dwellings on the site.
So the chairman of the legislative com-
mittee moved that the Council should “affirm
the principle” of the erection of workers'
dwellings in order that the compulsory pur-
chase of slum properties might lawfully
come to pass. Whereupon another coun-
cillor remarked that workmen’s cottages
couldn’t be,.. erected on resumed slum areas
in cramped spaces where no new dwelling-
houses would be possible under the latest
building regulations; so what was the use
of “affirming the principle”? The Gaud
Mayor swam out to the rescue with the
explanation that slum areas could be used
fo: factory sites or ornamental reserves;
whereupon the new Town Clerk stopped the
fruitless proceeding by declaring that nobody
knew whether the Town Council could do
anything at all with slum areas —the ques-
tion as to its powers was now “under the'
consideration” of Cabinet. So the gay old
civic coouetters devoted two or three hours
to squabbling over their diverse opinions
as to what they should do when they had
exercised certain powers, regardless of the
fact that they didn’t know what their powers
were, and had to wait for Premier Peacock
to tell them how and where they stood.
So the whiskies and the sodas were the
whole 1 evening’s real work.

The
Correct
Feeding of
Infants
NO attempt to provide a
correct system for the
progressive feeding of
Infants was ever successfully
carried out until the ‘Allen-
burys’ series of Infants’ Foods
were introduced. So successful
have the ‘Allenburys’ Foods
Nos. I, 2 and 3 proved, that
whenever a chill is denied the
privilege of the mother’s milk
they are indispensable. Gratifying evidence
of their remarkable value in the feeding
of infants from birth is constantly coming
to hand. The following is a copy ol one
of many such voluntary letters received
from Medical Men, Nurses and Parents
resident in nearly all parts of the world.
A NURSE WRITES:
“I am pleased to say I have used your Focd3 1,2 and 3 for the
last twenty years and have found none better. The
most delicate baby ever born I nursed and reared on the
Foods until he was 3 years old, and now he is 18 YEARS, and
a strong healthy boy nearly 6 leet high and as rosy as an
apple. You can make whatever use you like of this as I
should like your Foods and other things to be more used in
fliture, as instead of malting fat alone they make
bone and muscle, which is what children need.
(Signed) NURSE DAVIE.
The practical results from a continually extending use of the
‘Allenburys’ Foods, pr.ove beyond doubt that children thrive excep-
tionally well on thorn. Such children are healthy and well grown; the
flesh is firm, without excess of fat and the formation of bone is solid.

Non-SRid Tyres.
For the hard road—for the hot pace—for the long
grind—for true economy and service .
The success of Firestone Tyres has proved that the motorist
can have comfort, safety and the “most miles per shilling,”
Firestone Tyres are preferred because of highest quality at the least
cost—as the greatest value, even though there are “cheaper" tyres.
The rubber in them is supremely good. It has the quality of greatest heat-
resistance, of greatest wear endurance. Every Firestone Tyre contains an extra quantity
of this extremely good rubber.
The Non-skid lettering is an imprint of safety. On every highway of the world it
challenges the need of other anti-skid -safeguards. It holds the standard for endurance
and economy. The letters prevent spin or skid in any direction, they radiate the heat
of road friction, insure perfect ~ traction with gasoline economy, car-protection and
comfort beyond contradiction.

For that wide-awake feeling
No one should be blamed
for over-sleeping any more
than blamed for walking
in his sleep.
Man is only partly con-
scious when he first opens
his eyes after a heavy
sleep. He needs help to
get wide awake at once.
Most men would get up
on time if they only real-
ised the time.
Big Ben makes them realise
it. Thus all who have his help
get up. Try it on yourself.
It will help you to get down to
work on time if you let Big
Ben help you out.
Big Ben is two good alarm clocks
in one —a long alarm that rings for 5
minutes continuously , and an inter-
mittent alarm that rings for 10 min-
utes at half-minute intervals. He
stands 7 inches tall. He’s massive,
well poised, triple plated. His face,
is frank, open, easy to read —his keys
large, strong, easy to wind.
Now if you sleep soundly —and you
do if you are a hard-working man—
use Big Ben. He’s made in La Salle,
Illinois, U.S.A., by Westclox. His
price is 12/6, postage 1/- extra. If
you cannot find him in your town,
send a money order to the makers’
Australian office, Westclox, cr. King
and Kent Sts., Sydney. They will
have one mailed to you by the
nearest jeweller.

“Jaques”: Can any Bulletin informa-
tion specialist decide which is the oldest
steamer afloat? Maoriland takes its oath
that the Stormbird is the veteran, while
Australia won't believe that anything can
beat the Edina. Ma England reckons she
is entitled to nominate the Ceres ot 1 ad-
stow, born 1811. But the Ceres was a sail-
ing vessel for over 100 years and was only
recently equipped with an oil engine, so she
can’t be classed as a steamer bred and born.
I reckon it is a close go between the Edina
and the Stormbird, as they were both born
in 1854.
“Carfax”: I have heard about 721 times
that if John Bull absolutely kept cotton
from reaching the Hun the war would be
over in a few months. My friend Smither-
eens who writes up war dope for the Daily
Yell is quite certain about it. Front-rank
scientists in London are pointing out that
the yarn is all bosh —that so long as vegeta-
tion grows on German soil the enemy will
never be short of either cellulose for manu-
facturing explosives or alcohol for motor
transport. Cotton was only used because
it was easier to manipulate. Now who has
the right end of things—Smithereens or the
front-rank scientists V
“Oliver Oatmeal” : How’s this for a record
price for butcher’s meat? Lawrence, a
Dunedin (M.L.) meat purveyor, recently
purchased 104 prime bullocks at £2O per
bead. Considering the number, this is said
to be the widest a cocky has ever opened his
head in Maoriland, though small pens of
beasts have often gone beyond £25, and I’ve
just heard of 700 being sold by a Sydney
firm at £24.

“F.S.S.” : ■ The Messageries Maritimes line
will resume the service between Sydney and
Marseilles on October 12. by the s.s. Sontay,
to be followed in January by the s.s.
Euphrates. This line was opened about 25
years ago with a flourish of trumpets and a
quartette of new steamers of 0000 tons each
—the Ville de la Ciotat, Polynesien, Aus-
tralien and Armand Behic. These then luxu-
rious boats started a new epoch in over-sea
travel, and while they were new attracted a
large share of passenger traffic. Then the
more-insinuating German pushed in, and the
non-progressive French line lost ground,
while the rival Nord-Deutscher Lloyd in-
creased its cargo and passenger traffic enor-
mously. In 1913 the French vessels entered
and cleared in the Commonwealth were only
366,730 tons, while the ships flying the Ger-
man flag reached 1,211,404 tons. This was
50 p.c. oyer the tonnage five years previously.
French shipping, despite the subsidy paid to
sailing vessels by the French Government,
dwindled year by year until 1914, when it
vanished. Considering that France, Bel-
gium and Holland during the 1914 season
took 669,022 bales of wool from Australia,
compared with 425,275 bales sent to Ger-
many, it looks curious that German freight
direct to Europe showed 800,046 tons
cleared, while only 306,153 tons of shipping
cleared for Belgium and France. It indicates
what a grip Germany held upon the trade
t) Antwerp in Belgium and Rotterdam
in Holland. The direct trade of these two
great entrepots will be worth a strong effort
on the part, of Australia to capture by and
bye.

“Maker”: “Canuk” (B. 9/9/T.5) says he
saw Jap brushes of good make retailed at
Is. per set of three, and that the cheapest
Australian-made shoe-brushes were whole-
saled at 245. per dozen sets. If the Jap.
brushes were prohibited entry into the
country altogether the public would be
protected from what can only be
described as a varnished fraud. One
set of the cheapest Australian-made brushes
will last out a case (250 sets) of the Jap
rubbish.

“Copabella” : You’ll find it in almost any
issue of any newspaper except the trade
journals—“and so the grasping retailer
scores again.” The distributor is always
supposed to be “on the make,” is always
doing some evil thing, appropriating some
illicit profit, seizing any excuse to exploit
the long-suffering public. Perhaps he is;
I’m a retailer and don’t feel competent to
express an opinion. What I do know is
that if a man means to avoid getting left,
he lias to creep on to every shy opportunity
that will give him a bit of extra profit; to
try all manner of schemes, more or less
honest, to balance the ever-recurring and
inevitable leakages. Careless employees,
“smart” merchants, dishonest customers,
waste, sneak thieves, railway risks, humor-
less inspectors, overweight, unreasonable
buyers, breakages, bad debtors, damaged
goods, slow-pays—all. serve to eat up the
margin of gross profit on which he tries to
run things. No doubt it seems anomalous
for me to speak of a dishonest customer,
Dishonesty being the seller’s other name;
and overweight in a grocer’s shop is, of
course, too absurd for anything but comic
opera. Yet for every pound of underweight
filched by the shopkeeper I’ll swear that a
hundred pounds of overweight is handed out
by inefficient counter-hands. In every
delivery of checked and double-checked goods
claims for shortages come in, but never a
word from the customers who received too
much. Not until the yearly or half-yearly
stocktaking can the trader know whether
his or the customers’ devious ways have
triumphed; so he reaches out for the odd
copper all the year, to build up a sort of
insurance fund for himself. And nine times
out of 10 he discovers at stocktaking that
he needs it.
A WARNING.

Dear Sir, —I must say that your True Hair Grower is a wonderlul prepara-

and although I naturally have a good head ot hair still, lately, it was causing
me a good deal of trouble, as it was falling out in handfuls and I "was greatly
troubled with Dandruff. Since using your preparation for three months my
hair has completely stopped falling, and there is not a sign of Dandruff in my
hair, and it has grown longer and thicker. You can rest assured that 1 will
do what I can towards inducing my friends to try your wonderful preparation.
Yours truly, JM. ENGLISH.

Every reader of this paper, man or

approaching baldness, scalp irritation,

Mr. Burleigh announces that he has so
much faith in the merits of his pre-
paration, which it is well to know lias
been used extensively by persons in
all walks of life and in all parts of the
world for upwards of 20 years, that he
again invites our readers to use the
coupon below and make earlv applica-
tion for a FREE TRIAL. No matter
what the present condition of your
scalp may be, no matter what so-called
remedies you have tried, until you have
tested this remarkable preparation you
cannot appreciate the value of a truly
scientific method of hair culture. You
('an prove in a few moments each morn-
ing or evening how simple it is to
grow beautiful hair with Mr. Burleigh’s
TRUE HAIR GROWER, and how
surprisingly one’s whole appearance,
one’s brightness and personal charms
are improved by slight attention to the
hair.
Hair troubles, like many other
diseases, have been wrongly diagnosed
and altogether misunderstood. The
hair itself is not the thing to be
treated, for the reason that it is simply
a product of the scalp, and wholly de-
pendent upon its action, The scalp is
the very soil in which the hair is pro-
duced, nurtured and grown, and it
alone should receive the attention if
results are to be expected. It would
do no earthly good to treat the stem
of a plant with a view to making it
grow and become more beautiful —the
soil in which the plant grows must be
attended to. Therefore, the scalp, in
which the hair grows, must receive the
attention, if you arc to expect it to
grow and become more beautiful. Loss
of hair is caused by the scalp drying-
up, or losing its supply of moisture or
nutriment ; when baldness occurs the
scalp has simply lost all its nourish-
ment, leaving nothing for the hair to
feed upon. (A plant, or even a tree,
would die under similar conditions.)
The natural thing to do in either case
is to feed or replenish the soil or scalp
as the case may be, and your crop will
grow and multiply as nature intended
it should. Mr. Burleigh’s TRUE
HAIR GROWER, we understand, has
a most wonderful effect upon the hair
glands and tissues of the scalp. It is
the only remedy for the hair ever dis-
covered that is similar to the natural
foods or liquids of the scalp. It pene-
trates the pores quickly, and the hair
soon shows the effects of its wonderful,
exhilarating and life-producing quali-
ties.

REXONA
Derek Hudson invests every role in
which he appears with his own per-
sonal charm and manliness, and it is
those qualities allied with his magni-
ficent baritone voice that have made
him the idol of the theatre-going
public, particularly that section ot it
still in its teens.
It is as Jose in “Gipsy
Love” and Slippery Jack in
“The Marriage Market” that
Australian audiences know
and admire Mr. Hudson so
much. He writes to us as
follows: —
I want to recommend
your Rexona and your
Rexona Soap, for they de-
serve it.
I have used them both,
and think they are fine.
As a healer Rexona is un-
equalled, and I am sure
anyone who once tries
Rexona Soap could not help
but appreciate it. I use it
for both bathing and shav-
ing, and you can count on
me as a good friend, for I
shall recommend it where-
ever I go.
Yours truly,
(Sgd.) DEREK HUDSON.
EVERYBODY’S USING IT NOW.
Rexona Soap and Ointment arc universal favorites with everyone who values a pure and
health - skin. The longer you hegleet your skin the harder it will be to care for it. Delay may
result in Kc/.ema, Psoriasis, Ringworm, Running' Sores, or some of the many unpleasant forms
that skin trouble so often assumes. Rexona, the Rapid Dealer, and Rexona Soap are sure
preservatives for the health
and skin. Rexona Soap keeps
the skin soft and pure, and
llexona, the Rapid Healer,
will immediately eradicate any
disease which may be ap-
parent, for it arouses the
skin to healthy activity, so
that it quickly recuperates and
the diseased skin becomes once
more sound and healthy. To
shave with Rexona Soap is
to make one look forward to
the operation with pleasure,
it produces a thick, creamy
lather and leaves the skin
soft and supple after the shav-
ing- is completed. Rexona is
sold everywhere in triangular
pots at 1/6; or in larger pots,
holding nearly four times the
quantity, at 3/-. Rexona Soap
is sold at 1/- a tablet.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Y lIE Faces beat upon my heart all day
And will not be denied ;
They come at me in hordes, or side by
side ~
In pairs discordant —faces stern and g
That seem to cry . . .
Mute mockery of their overweening pride,
And faces pitiable with haggard eyes
And tremulous down-drawn mouths, and
faces dry , . ,
And dead as chiselled wood, and faces pale
With stress and agony
Of life's unending fret
And shrill abhorrent sordid miseries ;
Faces that mourn slain dreams and taitlis
that fail
Or suns of hope that set,
And faces hard from which the human spaik
Has died since cruel hate .
Stamped on their sweetness its endunn s
mark
That pitv’s self cannot obliterate;
Dim furtive faces somehow overbold
That rill the night with passion s grisliest
thing, , , ,
More terrible than sly Death’s leaping stingy
The baleful eyes of harlots in the dark. . ..
Oh, viperish, cold,
A cowering menace in dear love s despite.
The eyes of prowling women of the night.
The Faces whisper comfort as I pass,
And will not be gainsaid— .
Faces of men who strong and unafraid
Rattle with beasts of Hell for human sake
And ’mid the conflict sing ;
Faces aglow with joy past questioning,
Faces of children playing on the grass,
Faces of lovers not afraid to slake
Their thirst and take
Perforce their boon from the close-listed
gods; .
Faces that mock grim Pain and all his rods,
Faces so sweet
And pure that they emparadise the street;
Faces of tender mothers bending to
Their dimpled babes, faces of dames grown
grey
In loyal service, faces worn and true
< )L : old men who
Amid life’s turmoil still have done their best
At love’s behest
And kept their minds at rest.
Sometimes, made glad by faces that I see.
I know that, come what may till I get
through,
The gods are good to me.

The Search for the Bonzer Tart.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“ OLD-BLOODED bigamist” the Law
1 ) called him; but the Law did not
hear the soul-aspirations that
prompted the search for the bonzer tart
undertaken by Chiller the Smooge as I did
during the time he was on remand. He
certainly tried to make the Law hear; but
the Law demands facts and was impatient
with what it regarded as his wanderings.
It was after Bob Burke, by an impas-
sioned appeal, during which he made the
most of the irrefutable argument that his
client was unlikely to take advantage ot
his liberty to repeat his offence, had man-
aged to secure merely nominal bail, that I
met the bigamist. I wanted to see Burke,
and Burke wanted to have a word or so
with his client; but he had another case due
in the court, for which he had to leave us.
As a consequence the bigamist and I were
together. . , ,
‘‘How long’ll he be, likely?” Chiller asked,
shortly.
“He said about an hour, I replied. But
you never know in a court how long a case
will take.”
“D’you mind having a drink, then t Chil-
ler suggested, half apologetically; and, as it
seemed the least dry way of passing time,
we sought the refreshment he suggested.
“How d’you think you’ll get on?” I asked
him. „ , ~
“I s’pose I’m bound to go up. he said,
gloomily. “You see, it’s the second time.”
“But they can’t charge you twice with the
same offence !”
“Oh, it’s not the same offence. Its the
second charge of bigamy,” he responded
evenly, as if that sort of offence was- an
everyday matter. But he apparently noticed
that his reply astounded me, for he added :
“It wasn’t my fault, Mister; I was druv to
it.”
He eyed his beer dismally.
“It’s* all right for most blokes," he said,
"when they make up their minds that the
piece they’re hitched to ain’t the bonzer tart
they thought. They can get over it, and
console ’emselves with the idea that if she
ain’t the bonzer tart she’s not a bad cook,
or it’s ’andy to ’ave someone to do the wash-
ii,’, or somethin’ like that. They go to the
races or the football match an’ forget every-
thing but the fact that there’ll be a ’ot tea
at ’ome waitin’ for ’em when they’ve fin-
ished the drinks they meet on the way.
With me it’s different. I’ve wanted the
bonzer tart all me life, an’ it’s alius worried
me when I’ve known I ’aven’t got ’er. You
see, some coves ’as soul, an’ a soul gives you
a lot of trouble.”
“And bigamy charges,” I suggested.
“Well—yes! But I think I’ve got the
bonzer tart now, anyway ; an’ I don’t mind
standing a stretch if I ’ave!.
“When I was a little kid almost,, you
know, I ’ad me ideas about wimmin ; ideals
you call ’em. The wimmin I mostly met
was factory girls with short skirts and pig-
tails and grown-up ideas about things that
most of ’em. thank Gawd, manage to get
over when they really grow up and learn
their foolishness. They ’adn’t much time
fer me. an’ I ’adn’t much time fer them,
though I sampled a lot of ’em. I tliort I
might find one to suit, but none did. They
was too darn familiar fer me, an’ I sheered
off ’em; an’ they got an idea that I ’ad a
bir of a rat. I don’t blame ’em; but it
didn’t worry me much, anyway.
“They called me ‘the Smooge’ because I
was alius chasing new muslins. Yet it
wasn’t because T wanted new pieces, but
because none of ’em satisfied me. They
druv me to it.”
“You suffered from sublime discontent, I
suggested.
"That’s right, Mister. Anyway, I s pose
it’s right. My first missus, now, was what
I thought was the bonzer tart, else I
shouldn’t have hitched with her. But 1
found she wasn’t. You get to know a lot
about a woman when you go with her ter a
while, but you never know exactly what
she’s like till you marry her. This ’ere
piece disguised herself more’n the others,
and that’s what led to me mistake, and she
useter listen to me talking about me ideals
as if she enjoyed them. Afterwards I found
’er ideals was a ’ome and three meals a day
an’ a feelin’ that she 'ad a man who was
just ’er OAvn property an’ nobody else’s ; an’
it didn’t matter much who he was. Give 'er
’er due, she wasn’t bad an’ did ’er best: but
’er idea that I was just a bloke wot had
to be fed reg’lar tired me. I ’ad a soul
that, some’ow, couldn’t be fed on eggs an’
bacon an’ beef. An’ the way she went fer
a tart I picked up with, thinking she was
the bonzer tart, settled all me delusions.
She did it with a fryin’-pan.
“It settled all me delusions about the
other tart, too. ’Ave you ever seen ’ow
gentle an’ sweetvoiced two women can be
when one ’as a fryin’-pan an’ another a
bottle, an’ both a grievance?
“After that I sheered off women for all
I Avas Avorth. But Avhen a man sheers off,
that’s the end of ’im; and I finds myself
living with a Avoman AA'liose ideal is to sac-
rifice everything for love. I got on with
her all right, although it Avas a bit of a
strain Avlien I come ’ome an’ find er Aveeping
over a novelette instead of getting me tea.
Still, a man forgives a lot of things if he
thinks a woman really loves ’im ; and this
uu useter say I reminded ’er of Sir Marina-
duke Fitztubley, or someone, in one of the
books, and I might Avell ’ave been him but
for an accident of birth.
“But in spite of her ideals she had, like
all wimmin, her love for respectability, and
she keeps worrying me about it.
“ ‘Give me me marriage lines,’ she says,
piteous. ‘A marriage lines is a woman’s
proudest possession.’ I says to myself:
‘Here’s a tart, virtuous’ (for, mind you, a
girl’s only unvirtuous if she's unvirtuous
with someone elseL ‘gentle, forbearin’,
capable of sacrifice’ —’aving made one fer
me —‘full of ideals and love and passion’:
and I takes the risk an’ another name and
marries her.
“Two days later she flung a cup of tea at
my ’ead and asks me if I’m fool enough to
believe what she said about Sir Marmaduke
Fitztubley. She made things ’ot. If I tried
to get aAvay from her she would rush fran-
tic’ly out of the house to let the neigh-
bors know I Avas murderin’ ’er. Then she'd
rush back to throw something at me, and
rush out again for some more screaming.
By the time every woman in the street had
got the habit of coming out to see me as I
passed, and saying ‘Brute!’ I decided that
it was best to clear. Then she goes to the
police an’ puts me aAvay fer bigamy.”
“What did she make all the trouble
about?” I inquired.
“Oh, it was only her way,” he responded.
“She wanted life to be a drama or a romance
or something. As long as I Avasn’t married
to ’er she was satisfied with the idea that
she was living in sin for my sake. ‘Love’s
sacrifice,’ she called it; and directly she lost
that she made rows and misunderstandings
on general principles. She must ’aA'e en-
joyed ’erself tiptop about that time. When
she came Avith a John ’Op to where I was
workin’ an’ says, ‘There is the villain!’ and
Avhen she ’ad a fit in court, and Avlien she
came to Darlinghurst, when me time aa'as
up, and ’eld me doAvn in the street to ask fer
fergiveness. But I didn’t do no fergivin.
The only way I like the drama is fer two
hours, now an’ then, at a bob a time. It's
an ’orror in the ’ome.
“Me first Avife fastens on another bloke
to give ’er the ’ome and the three meals a
day and the bloke that’s ’er own property,
and gets a divorce; an’ I goes out in the
world, so to speak, with me ideals about
wimmin dinted but not broke. Then I gets
them dinted some more. She was a religious
piece this, and she gets me that Avay that I
think she’s a saint, an’ ’ardly like to touch
’er. Blow me if church doesn’t see me reg’lar
on Sundays; an’ after we’re married I see
nothing to change me vieAvs about ’er until
just before the kid is born she tells me
things. As I see it now, it Avas a rotten
tale; an’ I don’t knoAV that I blame the poor
girl fer gettin’ a father for the child its oavu
father wouldn’t give ’is name to; but ’er
’aving told me she wouldn’t marry me un-
less I became religious, and tried all that
sham on me —it was red ’ot and I chucked
’er.”
“Did she put you aAvay?”
“Not she!” he said, quickly. “That ain't
’ev sort! Why, if I ’ac.n't parted up to see
’er over ’er trouble, just because there
wasn’t anyone else to do it, an’ left ’er a
few quid to help her afterwards, and she
wanted to pay me back, she wouldn’t ’ave
troubled me at all. Oh, she might easily
’ave been the bonzer tart, as far as that
gees; but she wasn’t the bonzer tart for
me. I thought she was dead, not ’aving
’eard anything of ’er for five-years, until
this case an’ I can tell you she
doesn’t like ’aving to give evidence against
me.
“The tart I’ve got at the present time,
now, she’s the bonzer tart. This is the way
she puts it to me: ‘Your wife's probably
dead,’ says she. ‘but if she isn’t it wouldn’t
be much risk for you to marry me. But I
don’t Avant you to run any risk at all,’ she
says; ‘l’m Avilling to trust you.’ Wlmt can
a bloke do when a tart talks like that —a
regular bonzer tart, fine-looking and Avell-
read and all that? Why. she knoAvs Ella
Wheeler Wilcox and Marie Crelli and
Garvice by heart!”
The bigamist ‘Svent up.” as he predicted :
but the Law, having admonished him with
heavy language, let him off Avith a light
sentence.
It was a couple of years later that I
suav him going his rounds with a rabbit cart.
“Why, hello, boss !" be cried. “ ’Ere, you
must ’ave some rabbits."
“But I don’t want .any, really.” I said.
“But you must have a pair,” he insisted ;
“just a present—here, it’s a fair thing.”
“And how are you getting on?” I asked.
“Tip-top.” he responded, heartily.

Have You an
o
Boils, Pimples, Spots, Rashes 8 other
Spring Skin-Troubles Banished.
WITH the approach of Spring do you find little
rough patches on your forehead, or cheek, or
chin? Has your skin a curious “tight” feeling? Are
your hands or finger-ends sore? Is your skin disfigured
by nasty pimples, boils, abscesses or eruptions? Have
you a raw, tender feeling where your skin creases—or
are you very liable to chafing about the neck?
These “danger signals,” which constitute the first
signs of an unhealthy skin, should never be neglected.
Following in their train are all the tortures of fiery
eczema, wide-reaching blood poison, and ulcerous sores.
Nothing is more important than the way we should
treat this skin disease. It is not the slightest use rely-
ing upon any internal remedy or external application if
these do not reach the impurity itself, which is the
cause of the disorganisation in our delicate and intricate
tissues. Cheap and coarse ointments and so-called
blood-mixtures may make eczema “slumber” awhile,
but the disease soon breaks forth in all its “fire” and
itching irritation, for the root-evil lias not been touched.
Zam-Buk is the ideal Spring Skin-Balm. Zam-Buk
is so refined that the tissues absorb it readily; and its
medicinal essences at once attack the disease below the
surface. Wherever the skin has been injured by acci-
dent or eaten by disease, Zam-Buk promotes the growth
of new and healthy tissues in a quick and natural
I manner.
Zam-Buk, the invalu-
able Spring Skin-Balm,
is excellent for Boils,
Pimples, Eruptions,
Eczema, Abscesses and
Blemishes; & promptly
heals Cuts, Burns,
Sores, Bruises, Abra-
sions, Scalds, Scalp
Troubles, Wounds,
Piles, Sprains, etc.
Obtainable from all
Chemists and Stores at
1/6 per pot, or 3/6
family size (containing
nearly four times the
1/6).
EVERY HOME NEEDS ZAM-BUK
Mr. H. Christie, of .16 London Street, Eiimore, Sydney,
says:—“l teas troubled with boils, and tried all manner of
things to get rid, of them, but to no avail. Seeing Zam-Buk
advertised, I procured a pot, and applied it as directed, with
the pleasing result that the boils had entirely disappeared after
three days’ treatment.”

“Found the bonzer tart?”
"I found ’er,” lie said.
Fhen he bubbled with enthusiasm.
I thought it was a mate of mine who w r as
paying me solicitor—Burke, you know —
but it was ’er all the time. Out of her
hard-earned. An’ when I comes out of quod,
there s she waiting for me, and she tells me
there s a home for me ready until I get me
tee , t ,M g^in- i^n ' there I’ve been ever since,
an likely to stay, as long as I can earn a
crust to keep it going. She’s the bonzer
tart all right; she’s ’ad ’er troubles an’ they
ain’t ’armed ’er.”
‘‘The girl you had when your case came
on?” I suggested.
’’ ’Fr? No!” he retorted indignantly.
‘Not er! She’s with another bloke. This
|s me second wife —the second one, lawful.
Chiller,’ she says, with the tears in ’er eyes
when she conies to gaol to see me—she comes
up reg’lar—‘if you ’adn’t been married to
me you wouldn’t ’ave been ’ere. It’s my
fault, and I’m sorry. I’ll look after you
when you come out,’ she says. ‘You gave
my little boy ’is name.’ says she, ‘and you
was always good, and you’ve been treated
shockin’.’
“An’ there’s the boy!” he added boister-
ously ; and I noticed the child on the cart.
“Come on, Pal!” he cried, “shake ’ands with
the gent. ’E ain't my kid, as you might
say,” he added, “but he’s no worse, as a kid,
for that. An’ ’e is my kid, too, because ’e
belongs to the missus. Ain’t you, eh?”
“My daddy!” said the boy, patting Chil-
ler’s scrubby face.
“That's the chicken!” cried the bigamist
cheerfully. “Anyway, we’ve got another of
these at home, and there ain’t no mistake
about that —eh, Pal!”
HAMER.
The Baulk in Dead Man’s Gully.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
DAMNATION!” said the regimental
sergeant-major. A disorganised,
wild-eyed mule convoy clattered out
of the mouth of the gully, and tried to short-
cut across the camp to the horse-lines. A
fatigue squad dropped their shovels and
rounded the heasts up. They were a job
lot, and had been doing things. One had
lost an eye and some of its face. Another
was spattered and bleeding, and its quarters
looked as if the owner had backed up against
a furnace. The third was whole, but scared
to death. The other two were missing. A
battered-looking wreck that was once a
water-cask clung to the frame-work that
trailed behind.
The regimental sergeant-major bore down
on the ruins. “H’m —shrapnel!” said he.
“That’s the third bally outfit I’ve lost since
we came to this blasted hole. Where’s the
push?”
As if in answer to the question, a dilapi-
dated figure debouched from the gully and
limped across to the camp. A dirty-looking,
dust-covered bunch of rags was wound about
his knee. “Gimme a drink, f’r ’evin's sake,”
lie gasped, as he flopped down on the grass.
They pushed a billy under his nose, and he
retired into its depths for a full minute.
Then he looked up. “If any o’ yous blokes
is sufferin’ fr’m ongwee, yous c’n amble up
gully an’ fetch me mates. They’re dead,
lon’ ’go; but yous might as well fetch ’em.”
So saying he toppled over in a faint.
“Take him across to the hospital,” said
the S.M., as he went off to. report to the
Colonel.
“Have to report mule-convoy shelled up
the gully, sir. Private Simpson and Lance-
corporal Farquhar killed; Sergeant Jones
wounded, back in hospital. All B Com-
pany.”
“The devil!” said the Colonel.
“Also two mules shot, and two others had
enough to be shot right away. Water-cart
back in camp, damaged. New cask and
repairs wanted.” And the regimental ser-
geant-major saluted.
The Colonel drummed his fingers on the
table. “We’ll have to stop all water con-
voys up-that infernal gully in the daytime,”
he said at last. The order went forth accord-
ingly.
For a while the sorely-tried convoys
stumbled up that twisted gully, as dark as
a nigger’s pocket, every night, cursing all
the way up to the spring and down again.
The drivers almost went down on their knees
to the powers begging permission to risk
the job in the day-time.
At last the day came when the tension
was eased up, and day traffic up Dead Man’s
Gully was duly authorised. A Sabbatical
calm had rested upon the place for about
a week, and it was decided to risk it.
All went well for a day or two. Then a
mule-convoy in charge of an Irish sergeant
named Mullaney, with two privates answer-
ing respectively to McFadyen and Colossi,
struck trouble all in a heap.
Half-way up the gully a bullet whistled in
Mullaney’s ear as it flew past him. and
flattened itself on a boulder. “Mother av
Christ!” he exclaimed. “The dhirty dogs
are at it again ! Shake ’er up !” And with
that he fetched the nearest mule a welt that
sent the team racing to the shelter of the
next bend. Here they stopped to consider
the situation.
“We’ve got abhoot a quarther av a mile
to go,” said Mullaney, “an’ th’ question is
whither we chance that quarther mile or do
the job afther tea.”
The meeting signified that it’d sooner
chance the job now than skin its shins
among the boulders in the dark.
“The worst part av th’ job is th’ next
p’int,” said Mullaney. “If we’re sh topped
there it’s good-night, nurse.”
They got the mules going, and Mullaney,
on ahead, was getting well round the point
when he heard a noise in the air like the
distant sound of an express train approach-
ing at a sixty-mile clip.
“Shrapnel! blast thim,” he exclaimed
The shell burst well behind them. “Come
? n! ’’ h e yelled. “Phwat are ye shtoppin’
for?”
The convoy had jibbed right in the open,
and the drivers were laying into the team
with the fury of desperation, while their
profanity filled the air. Again came the
sound of the express train from the invis-
ible distance. The shell this time burst right
over the jibbing mules, and the bullets, fly-
ing forward at an angle, as is the way of
shrapnel caught McFadyen as lie raced for
cover—the poor devil ran right into it—and
.Patched forward in a heap, stone dead,
i • , n , aV'!’, Colossi, run fr it, I tel] ye!”
shrieked Mullaney. “Nivei* moind —ooch !”
A sniper s bullet cut his last seiitence off in
the middle. He reeled like a drunkard,
gasped, and fell backwards.
Colossi, playing a lone hand, decided to
give the . team another go before the next
S - i n | ri '. ived - ° ne m «le lay dead in the
middle of the bunch, and Colossi, cursing in
two languages, promised the survivors all
sorts, from a grandfather of a hiding to a
teed ot green oats. No good ! Then he heard
the express train again, and ducked under
the cart for a sporting chance to live a little
longer. i.
Boom ! The shell burst high, about half
a second overset in the fuse, and the leaden
hailstorm pattered down into the gully
about twenty yards ahead.
Colossi crawled out from under the wag-
gon and with one last effort got the team’s
head round. The mules, -with their noses
pointing for .the feed box, were so eager to
get a move on that the man hardly had time
to cut away the traces from the dead ’uns
and climb aboard the cart before they were
oti hell-for-leather down the gully.
Five minutes later the camp fatigues saw
a riotous mule team careering like scalded
cats out of the gully, with a black-haired
lunatic on top of the cart, singing weird
songs in a foreign tongue.
Colossi had come home.

The Roll-call on the Beach.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
MERTON, who is best of fellows.
With a loud, resoundilig knock,
This Spring morning from my slumber
Woke me up at six o’clock.
Somewhat sullen I responded,
Rose, and threw the house-door wide;
But his golden grin of greeting
Seemed to warm the world outside.
Everywhere was glowing sunshine,
Light and song were everywhere ;
Down the road we fared together
Joyfully, as men should fare.
Was it I, myself, I wondered
Who, last night, was so cast down,
Talking much of war and trouble
With some fellows in the town?
Where was war now —where its sorrows,
Where its trail of pain and death?
Here was joyance—here was sunshine,
Here was morning’s life and breath.
Was yon note of bird a bugle
Such as burial-parties blow?
Sure, ’tw r as someone’s idle fooling.
That wild tale of war and woe!
Then the ocean rose before us,
Broad and free, and fair and frank.
Were yon breakers, shoreward charging.
White-horsed swordsmen, rank on rank?
Merton laughed—liis laugh is catching.
Men like Merton bloom and thrive.
Merton raised his arms and shouted :
“God, ’tis good to be alive !”
Ah, to see him breast the breakers
As he breasted them to-day—-
Brown arms swinging, head half-buried,
r Rolling to the range’s play !
Sure, the sea tried all to conquer—-
Down him, drown him, break his pride ;
But he rode upon its menace
As a god himself might ride.
Then a thought came, watching Merton,
And the thought took words at length.
And I said : “ ’Tis man and Nature—•
Strength and will at war with strength.”
Ah, to see him shoot the breakers,
Meet the curved wave as it towered,
Yield himself in glad surrender,
By its fury overpowered ;
Lose himself in hissing smother.
Like an arrow shoreward run,
Rise among the creaming shallows.
Gleaming in the morning sun !
That was how he swam this morning,
Courage thrusting back all fears ;
Other men were there beside him—
Merton’s like, but not his peers.
As I watched them dive and gambol,
Roll and tumble, laugh and shout,
“What,” I mused, “is this war-fiction
That men make such talk about?
“Here is neither red disaster,
Fire nor fury, storm nor strife ;
Here is only peace and joyance—
Here is only thrill of life!”
Then, foregathering all together,
Talk of many things we had—
Talk of horse and talk of cricket,
Talk of fortune, good and bad :
Then said someone: “Where is Mason?”
And ano'her: “Where is Hall?”
And a silence fell upon us. . ..
And we heard the breakers fall.
“Where,” said one, “is Jimmy Andrews?”
And, above the breakers’ noise,
One voice seemed to rise and tremble :
“Where are all the other boys?”
Silent stood the group of surfers,
Sound and sunshine filled the air;
But it seemed the breakers called us,
And they sobbed an answer: “Where?'’
“Where are they the young, the gallant,
Where are they the strong, the gay,
Where are they our brown-armed lovers?”—
This the breakers seemed to say.
Then the surf came spreading shoreward.
With a strange, white, searching reach :
And ’twas thus we took this morning
That lone roll-call on the beach.
So I knew it was no fiction,
This war-talk, no jester’s lies.
Merton knew, too, for a purpose,
Grim and steadfast, steeled his eyes.

A Natural Remedy
Time was when disease was thought to be due to the
direct influence of evil spirits, and exorcism and magic
were invoked to cast it out.
Science has taught us wisdom. The evil spirits exist
still. We call them “Disease Germs,” and they also
must be cast out. Once lodged in the stomach or
intestines, fever with its hallucinations, or biliousness with
its aches and pains, is the result.
ENO S FRUIT SALT’
is the approved remedy for driving out disease germs.
Its action is quick and thorough. It clears the inte>tines,
rouses the torpid liver to new life, stimulates the mucous
membrane to a healthy action, and cleanses and invigorates
the whole digestive tract.
Be prepared for emergencies by always keeping a

Is “Economy”
Your
Watchword ?
If so you will be deeply
interested in the increased
steaming power of your boiler,
the more satisfactory working
of your engine, the greater
efficiency of your whole plant,
and, further, the big reduction
in your fuel bill, all of which
can be accomplished by the
adoption of
Newall’s Magnesia
Sectional Steam
Pipe Coverings and
Plastic Boiler
Covering
the EXCEPTIONAL EFFICIENCY of which has placed it
FAR ABOVE ALE OTHER MATERIALS.
The above claims are not merely “idle words,” but are all
clinched by FACTS in evidence of which we might mention
that Newall’s Coverings have been adopted exclusively by the
N.S.W. and Victorian Governments, and have been used throughout
Ultimo and White Bay Power Houses, in addition to which we have
orders on hand for the insulating throughout of Perth, Melbourne
and Canberra Power Stations.
Should further argument be necessary, we append the comparative
covering capacities of Newall’s Plastic Boiler Covering and ordinary
asbestos. J
lewt, ordinary asbestos will cover 40 sq. ft. x lin. thick.
Icwt. Newall’s Plastic Magnesia will cover 100 sq. ft x lin.
thick.
