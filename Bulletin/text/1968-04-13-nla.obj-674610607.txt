FUSSY
WE’VE GROWN accustomed m head-
waiters barring the tieless and coatless
from restaurants. Now, however, the
attack has moved below the waist. An
Italian cafe in Carlton, Melbourne,
denies access, in two languages, to the
shoeless. Perhaps with home’made wine
a popular local beverage, people with
grape-stained feet have been marking
the lino.
COUNTING HEADS
“WE’RE PROUD of them,” cried the
Sydney “Daily Mirror,” when one of
those interminable surveys showed that
64 percent of young people believed
in God and 43 percent went to church.
Well, the “Daily Mirror” may be satis-
fied, but is God?
A SHOT IN THE DARK
ITS ORGANISERS bear no false illu-
sions about its chances of success; in
fact, they call it a shot in the dark.
Nevertheless, Darwin’s new pottery
school for Aborigines is ready to oper-
ate, and British potter Michael Car-
dew is here to help establish it.
The Northern Territory Administra-
tion and the University of New South
Wales have invited Cardew to join the
project, because he spent more than
20 years in West Africa developing
native craft pottery into a financially
successful industry, and the Admin-
istration and the University are hoping
something of this kind can be done here
to help create a bridge for the Abo-
rigines between nomadic life and life
in the towns. However, it’s likely to be
a tougher task than the one Cardew
faced in Africa, since the Australian
Aborigines are one of the few races
with no tradition of pottery making
anywhere in their history.
“We don’t know if they’ll be in-
terested or not,” Mr. Ivan McMeekin,
of the University of New South Wales’
Department of Industrial Arts told us,
“but if we draw a blank with the adult
Aborigines, at least pottery will be
available as a course to the younger
people going to school there.
“But to start with, Aborigines from
different settlements and missions will
be brought in to have a look, and we’ll
be sending teachers from Sydney to
run training courses, with which we’re
hoping to train teachers already in the
Territory.
“It’s going to mean a lot of research
into teaching methods, too, of course—
into finding the best way of interesting
the Aborigines in pottery. That’s why
the University’s so interested because
it does represent research into Abo-
riginal problems.
“The idea first came up six or seven
years ago when a certain geologist in
the Territory suggested pottery might
be a suitable kind of craft for the Abo-
rigines. Then other people took it up,
the welfare branch introduced pottery
in the schools three or four years ago,
and we’ve been at work on the new
centre for about 18 months. It’s on a
government reserve, the Bagot Reserve
in Darwin, and it’s about five miles
from an educational complex where the
teachers and trainees will live.”
Mr. Cardew, who is 67, tanned and
energetic looking, with a voice booming
in richly good-humored Oxford tones,
came to Sydney last week from
New Zealand, where he spent almost
two months as visiting artist to the Pan-
Pacific Arts Festival. “Both things •
that and the school came up at
once, so I thought I’d do theta before
I settled too much in the slough of
retirement.”
He knows something of Aboriginal
art, and while he won’t be trying to
influence the Aborigines at the school
to produce an aggressively Australian
style of pottery, he thinks traditional
Aboriginal designs will gradually
emerge in their work.
“What they want to do will be up
to them. I remember in Nigeria, there
was a European teacher who was
encouraging one of the Nigerians to
go on making very simple pots which
had a great deal of charm because they
were naive, but you can’t go on doing
this, because it becomes ‘false naive,’
and fundamentally disrespectful to the
black man.
“Yet in no time at all, the pottery
did acquire the racial characteristics of
those who were doing it. How long it
will take to happen here, I don’t know.
Yes, some of the West African pieces
have considerable value as collectors’
items, because they’re early examples
of anew school.”
FROM KATANGA TO VIETNAM
IN 1953 an impressive book on modern
Catholic writers called “Maria Cross”
appeared under the pseudonym Donat
O’Donnell, a name also attached to
many “New Statesman” articles of the
period. It belonged, obviously, to an
Irishman, Dr. Conor Cruise O’Brien,
who passed through Australia last week
from a New Zealand peace conference
and spoke in Sydney on Vietnam under
the title: “U.S.A., the UN and Revolu-
tion.”
The name Conor Cruise O’Brien (it
sounds more like a pseudonym than
Donat O’Donnell) is not the only
striking thing about him. His varied
experiences in the last 30 years as a
civil servant, literary critic, diplomat,.
UN official, academic, cultural, his-
torian, and writer have fitted him for his
recent elevation into one of those repre-
sentative cultural figures who embody
the views of some new and influential
current of thought, this time anti-anti-
Communism. He is one of that group
of critics who combine their political
and literary insights in describing the
large problems of East-West relations
in terms of their cultural bases, though
he sees his work — collected in “Writ-
ers and Politics (1965)” — as more
in the line of previous generation critics
like George Orwell and Edmund Wilson
than of his contemporaries, A. Alvarez
and George Steiner.
O’Brien sees the world through J. P.
Sartre’s principle that we help the
oppressed all over the globe by expos-
ing the deficiencies of our own society
rather than by condemning the ills of
remoter ones. He has therefore em-
barked on a program of home criticism,
of exposing the assumptions of what he
calls the “richer and more plausible
mendacities of the West.”
One Western institution which
O’Brien objected to for excessive anti-
Communism and concentration on East
European inadequacies was the maga-
zine “Encounter.” Its columnist “R”
(Goronwy Rees) denied O’Brien’s

charges and counter-attacked in re-
viewing “Writers and Politics.” This led
to a series of libel trials in Ireland and
England in 1966, which, unfortunately
for “Encounter,” coincided with the
revelations of CIA financing of that
magazine, so O’Brien emerged from the
clash unscathed.
In a 1966 talk, “The Writer and the
Power Structure,” O’Brien said he con-
sidered that Western writers could be
“envious” of their Eastern colleagues’
more direct influence on power: in
Communist countries literature is in a
close and compressed relationship with
the regime, which takes notice of, and
is affected by, it, whereas in our soci-
eties the writer has only a diffuse and
nebulous connection with the power
structure: “In the East, the giant heaves
and squirms. In the West, the giant,
after a long silence, sighs and thanks
itself for freedom of expression.”
Though the Sinyavsky-Daniel and
more recent trials in Russia have led
commentators to protest that the Rus-
sians weren’t influenced by the content
of what the writers said, but simply sat
on them when they felt like it a
peculiar kind of influence! O’Brien
still maintains his original position, and
adds: “The Russian writers’ troubles
are increased by certain protests in the
West. Radio Liberty, which is financed
by the CIA, broadcasts their writings
widely. If the U.S. President called a
halt to the extent of this, things would
improve.”
The relations between rich and poor
countries and inter-racial problems are
O’Brien’s chief interests at the moment,
and Vietnam the chief example of
them. It remains unwise for advanced
and rich countries, he believes, to
impose their structures on other
countries from above. The U.S. should
announce a policy of non-intervention
in others’ civil wars, and of respect of
other societies. “The main problem is
the de-internationalisation of the con-
flict, not deciding what kind of
Government South Vietnam should
have. Leave them to it.”
Despite his own experience as a UN
representative and peacemaker in the
Congo, where he resigned in protest
against the British and American atti-
tude to the secession of Katanga, he
believes in a UN-supervised phased
withdrawal of all foreign troops in
Vietnam. “The Congo is no paradise,
believe me, but it is much better than
it would be if it was still an inter-
national hunting-ground.”
During all this, Dr. O’Brien has
continued his work on what is his
native and probably his best field: Irish
criticism and cultural history. He
believes that that period of imaginative
and political ferment in Ireland from
Parnell to the 19205, which came in
the 30 or so years before his time, has
decisively shaped his own work, for
instance, his long, 70-page essay on
W. B. Yeats’ flirtation with Fascism,
particularly in the comic and typically
Irish interlude of O’Duffy and his
Blueshirts (imitators of Mussolini) in
1934, and also on Yeats’ tendency to
dignify violence.
Two more books of O’Brien’s are
soon to be published. One is on the
Institution of the United Nations as a
Sacred Drama, in which he tries to
show, by using the techniques of
literary criticism, how the workings of
the UN resemble the institutionalisa-
tion of ritual more than those of an
ordinary, pragmatic organisation. The
second book is a play on the tragic
conflict of Lumumba and Hammar-
skjold in the Congo.
Conor Cruise O’Brien has, from his
long diplomatic experience, urbanity,
and control, perfectly suited to the
week’s events, which were potentially
awkward, even embarrassing, for a
visiting peacenik delegation.
PATRICK MORGAN
ALL GREEK
A BOOK HAS just reached us, pre-
pared by the Panhellenic Confedera-
tion of the Reserve Officers, and
purporting to explain why the Revolu-
tion of April 21, 1967, took place.
However, it still seems to leave some
of those distressing events somewhat
vague.
“The 21st of April, 1967, a complete
change took place in Greece,” the book
reports. “Our National Army threw
out the useless status quo of the
exchange, the illusion and retrogression,
and there was heard a new ‘No’,
similar to that which only Greek
people can pronounce.
“Although the outbreak was blood-
less, it immobilised all the politicians,
those incapable, impadent, betrayers
and swraters Greek politicians, the
Communists, and those who had
changed the House of Sessions to a
bawdy-house.” Recalling the state of
Athens before the coup, the book says,.
“First comes the Gorgopotamos story,
when the Communist-demonstrators
were unstitching the officers’s gallons,
while the simple men were wondering
what did the leaders of the country
do.” (The Gorgopotamos story, the
book explains, refers to an incident in
World War II when “an old torpor
exploded and caused the death of
several people.”)
Things, apparently, are back to
normal now. “On the roads the citizens
and foreigners do not face any danger
and the round bread’s seller offers
them without trouble while the flower
shops are distinguished open. And the
soldiers taking advantage of the com-
plete peacefulness and order which
exist are resting on the grass plat of
Hilton’s square. That what happened
during 21st of April, 1967, can not
be characterised as a revolution, but
as a natural development of abolishing
a democratic conditions which people
could not stand any more.”
Of course, it’s awfully easy to make
fun of other people, struggling to
express themselves in another language.
However, it may be true, as that last
paragraph suggests, that the revolution
abolished a democratic condition.

Paying the
price of too much
freeloading
YOUR CORRESPONDENT is crying
out for mercy and a special hardship
allowance. There are so many public-
relations firms and eager expense
accounts on the prowl that survival is
becoming increasingly difficult. This
fortnight there have been eight wine
tastings on the lists, including Chilean,
Italian, and South African wines. The
Italian Trade Department turned on
the largest, an affair for 400, at the
Chevron, with 71 wines to be tasted,
from gentle, pale chianti right through
to the tortures of the sweet and heavy
to the spumantes. This was from 10 a.m.
to noon. Frankly, a man should have a
rule, absolutely no chianti before 10
a.m.
But so much freeloading is going on
that the competition for the freeloader
is becoming increasingly tough. He
won’t just freeload for anything. Several

weeks back the State Savings Bank went
so far as to bring 5 down yabbies from
the River Murray. This was a mighty
gesture. In the terrible drought most of
us have not been able to get out with
pieces of string and bits of meat for
more than a year. So the yabbies were
served on silver salvers and most appre-
ciated.
Then the Plastalcn raincoat people—
they have had to take very desperate
measures, these raincoat people
announced a witchetty grub lunch. It
is not generally realised that, because
of fallen rivers and bone-dry conditions
in the bark, witchetty grubs throughout
the State and Riverina have all perished.
Many of us, desperate for witchetties,
sprinted to this affair. The truth was
we had been tricked. They were tinned
Mexican agave worms. Tinned worm
is never the same; it loses its mysterious
cheesy tang.
At various functions over the years
we have had diamond-backed rattle-
snake (a little greasy for the sensitive
palate), fried ants, grilled grasshopper
(quite crunch), roast buffalo, pickled
crocodile (vile), smoked silkworm, octo-
pus, and snail. Len Evans, when he
was with the Wine Board, provided us
with snails. He pointed out that there
was really no eating snail finer than
the Australian domestic snail. Sydney
Hyde Park snails were good, but he
did suggest that snails found on the
west side had a more succulent quality.
Then last week your correspondent
was invited to a vulpes luncheon. One
searched back into one’s memory of
Leaving (failed) Latin and thought,
surely, it couldn’t be, we’re going to
eat fox. This was very cunning public
relations.
Mr. Jacob Van Raalte of Ralta Ltd.
wanted to put over a new frying pan
with a non-stick abrasion-resistant finish.
But how to do it? Everything else had
been eaten, worm, grub, grasshopper,
crocodile . . . after careful probing, PR
man John Brennan discovered that Mr.
Van Raalte had been in the Dutch
Underground during World War II and
had survived by eating fox. This was a
natural. Incredibly, foxes had been en-
tirely overlooked for PR lunches.
So he managed to get hold of three
foxes. Two were shot near Narre War-
ren by members of the Sporting
Shooters’ Association and a third near
Geelong. Oh, everything was superbly
done. He invited along members of
the Vermin and Noxious Weed Destruc-
tion Board. The ballroom at the
Southern Cross was decorated with a
stuffed fox. Then, as we entered, we
all received a complete rundown cn
the habits of foxes and how to cook
them. Ninety percent of its food con-
sisted of rats, field mice, and other
rodents . . . although a clean animal,
it had a repelling odor, particularly
when skinned, which was offensive to
humans and other animals.
Suddenly one didn’t feel quite so
hungry as heretofore, but then we also
received a recipe. 1. Skin the fox and

cut it into small pieces. 2. Soak for 12
hours in water with a touch of vinegar.
3. Rub the fox meat with salt, nutmeg,
curry, paprika, cloves, and fine herbs.
4. After allowing the herbs to settle for
3 to 5 hours, sprinkle and rub the fox
meat with red wine.
Thereupon, Mr. Jacob Van Raalte
personally cooked the fox for us in his
non-stick, non-stain, abrasion-resistant
frypan. As the cooking went on I stood
with Mr. Geoff Douglas, of the Vermin
and Noxious Weeds Destruction Board.
He said the Victorian Government paid
a 70-cent scalp bonus for foxes, and
60,000 were destroyed a year. And we
agreed how much easier it would be for
Sir Henry if Victorians followed Mr.
Van Raalte’s lead and ate them. Mr.
Douglas said not to be alarmed, fox
was a high-protein, low-fat diet.
Mr. Van Raalte served his fox as a
pate in savory boats, as a stew in little
patties, and as straight slices of fried
meat. He assured us it was very tasty,
with overtones of venison.
Now, had it been a blind tasting, one
would have mused for a moment and
said: “I feel this could be dalmatian,
or airedale with perhaps just a strain of
fox terrier on the finish. And if you
insist on asking where it came from, I
would say it was shot very early in
the morning, on the west side of
Hoddle Street, Collingwood.”
Frankly, as a new taste sensation,
ycur man has tasted more exciting
dishes than fcx, and if one can talk to
the animals for a moment the message
is this: Look out for humans, they’ll
eat anything.
But it’s not only fox-eating, it’s the
expense-account lunch. We have esti-
mated that there are approximately
7500 first-class eating seats available in
Melbourne every lunchtime, and a good
proportion of them are eating to save
problems for the Tax Department.
Places like the Southern Cross Hotel
and the Oriental even have all-male
club grills, and the Lido has been run-
ning special “business - executive”
lunches. These are particularly tough
on the business chap. Not only does he
have to eat filet mignons, hearts of
palm vinaigrette, and all that sort of
thing but he has to lock at Topless
Lido Goddesses as well. It all takes
about two and a half hours. And just
lately they have been closing in with
breakfasts. Qantas, Remington Rand,
and the Egg Board have all been throw-
ing champagne breakfasts. It’s hard.
There is a sign of hope. The YMCA
has opened a businessman’s gymnasium.
The idea is that business executives go
there for lunchtime “get-fit” sessions
instead of eating. For example, the
executives of the State Electricity Com-
mission are now meeting there for one-
hour sessions every Monday and Thurs-
day. They start with ten laps around
the gym, then they do a series of tough
exercises under a gym instructor, and
then they have half an hour of volley
ball.
Their average age is 52, and they
work at it very hard. Who knows, they
might live to be a very fit 53.

. . . Two hundred and nine feet up
on the first floor, part-time manager
Mr. Konakci, who is Turkish, is count-
ing the till-money in desultory fashion.
Rising slowly from Dawes Point Park
level at the base of the bridge, where
women visitors can sit in safety on
benches labelled LADIES, is the lift
bearing a Chinese attendant who is
selling 20-cent programs to three
visitors. They reach bridge level and
have to walk the rest. It seems like
Mount Everest.
Up at 251 ft. level, Marie, in the
confectionery bar, is hammering at the
ice-box and saying what a noise, she’s
like a woodpecker gone mad. Claire
and May, the Pylon teashop waitresses,
are discussing bus time-tables and say-
ing, well, they have been busy but
they haven’t, if you know what they
mean. It’s funny, really. They think
competition from the AMP has some-
thing to do with it, oh, and the Can-
berra, which is leaving today, people do
like ships, don’t they? And at 285 ft.
level, Lola sits behind the souvenirs
counter knitting and reading, her page
weighted down with a wooden kangaroo
and produces, on request, souvenirs ex-
clusive to the Pylon. That is, boomerang
ashtrays and cups and saucers decor-
ated with Pylon views. These simply
cannot be bought elsewhere, she says.
At 300 ft. level is the Roof Top with
its three famous white cats, Horatio,
Bridget, and Pylon, whose sexual appe-
tites have raised $2OO for charity
through the sale of their offspring. They
are publicised as whirling on a merry-
go-round, trustworthy keepers of the
Wishing Well’s secrets; at this moment
they are filthy and asleep in the power
compressor.
Mr. Konakci is not sure how many
visitors have been to the Pylon today
which, claims the program, is to Sydney
what the Eiffel Tower is to Paris or

takes five months to build.”
But today, at four o’clock, no one’s
stopping for anything. Not even Crown

Spaceman Koala in his magical Space

versa which gives an unusual slant on

panoramic views of Sydney life, or the

time for a quick phone call from the
teatowel-draped booth in the corner
and no time at all to send Mother a
Technicolor PC in the Pylon’s post-
box. There is a sudden influx of people,
at 30 cents a head, to wave the Can-
berra off. “I’n it funny,” says one,
“how small it looks at sea.” “Yeah, i’n
it?” says her friend.
At times like this, people have the
urge to throw things from the rooftop
Mr. Konakci is here to see they do
not. He therefore misses two lower-
level dramas: one youth shouts at
Camera Reversa he ain’t putting in
five cents, he’s giving them nuffink, not
a bleedin’ thing, and downstairs the
lady inquiring after Cedric Flower’s
mural discovers it. There. Right over

Can cryptogamy
be made
in heaven?
BY ROSS CAMPBELL
ONE OF the subjects I never “took”
at school was botany. It was not taught
in boys’ schools in those days, as botany
was considered a suitable study only
for girls. This may have had something
to do with the fact that flowers were
beautiful, and therefore unworthy of
the attention of virile Australians. I
mention it only to explain why, until
lately, I had not heard of cryptogams.
I came across them in a popular book
on plants. It explained that some plants,
such as ferns and mosses, do not carry
on a public sex life. They do not grow
flowers, the flamboyant organs usually
associated with vegetable eroticism, but
reproduce by more shy and furtive
means. To give a name to these modest
things, botanists joined the Greek words
kruptos (hidden) and gamos (mar-
riage) and coined the delightful term
cryptogams plants that have hidden
marriages.
I read this with a thrill of discovery.
Here at last is the word we have been
looking for to denote the mating prac-
tices of certain show-business personal-
ities. From time to time the world is
agog with rumors that some celebrated
pair have been secretly wedded. How
neatly one such question could have
been expressed in the headline: MIA
AND FRANK CRYPTOGAMS?
Cases of cryptogamy are most frequent
among the youthful stars of pop music
and television, who prefer their fans
to retain as long as possible the illu-
sion that they are unmarried.
Botany also provides us with a word
for the opposite practice to cryptogamy
—that of getting married in an overt
fashion. Flowering plants, whose con-
jugal rites are performed openly, are
called phanerogams, from the Greek
phaneros (visible, manifest). Most
human beings are phanerogams. I am
one myself, having been married with-
out any attempt at concealment; though
admittedly, the public showed little in-
terest in the ceremony. The weddings
of prominent persons, such as royalty
and leading footballers, are often
attended with excessive publicity. Such
persons might be described as hyper-
phanerogamous. |
For coining nouns to denote various
aspects of marriage, the Greek root
“gam” has the advantage over its Latin
equivalents (used in such words as
matrimony) that it is short and handy.
It has done good service in the com-
pounds bigamy and polygamy. I believe
it could be exploited further to supply
some long-needed terms.
Persons who pretend to be married
when they are not —an accepted cate-
gory in inner districts like Kings Cross
might be called pseudogams. An
elegant innovation could be made by
using the prefix “hypo,” which conveys
the sense of somewhat, or less than
normal, or under the - lap.- The term
hypogamy would serve to denote that
kind of relationship, regrettably com-
mon today, which is something less than
marriage but more than being engaged.
A Greek writer actually used the word
hypogamion in this delicate sense;
Liddell and Scott’s lexicon translates it
with English bluntness as “illicit inter-
course with a betrothed person.”
The most serious impediment to both
hypogamy and cryptogamy is, of course,
pregnancy. Beyond a certain stage this
usually forces those concerned to be-
come phanerogams.
It is a harder task to find a word
for the American custom of marrying
a number of persons one after the
other. Polygamy will not do, as it means
being married to them at the same
time. The closest I can get to a
term denoting the marital mores of Zsa
Zsa Gabor or Ava Gardner is serial-
ogamy unfortunately a mongrel
Greco-Roman formation that will make
Bulletin readers shudder.
It can be hoped, however, that such
coinages will lighten the tasks of those
who have to report on the private lives
of entertainers the Beatles, for ex-
ample. John was known early to be
married, but tried to de-emphasise the
fact; he was a hypophanerogam. The
other three were regarded at various
times as hypogams or cryptogams.
Only when their popularity had waned
did they all, except Paul, e'mbark on
humdrum phanerogamy. The Rolling
Stones, by contrast, seem generally to
combine agamy (non-'marriage) with
having a good time.
I have been studying the case of two
Australian pop singers who were
reported by a newspaper to be roman-
tically attached. Another newspaper
then revealed that the male singer was
married to so'meone else. There is no
exact parallel to this situation in botany,
but the pair might be classed as pseudo-
hypogams. One can only hope it is the
pseudohypogamy of true minds.


British
Tobacco's
Report
on 1967
The combined profit of the British Tobacco
Company Group showed an increase in the
year ended 31st October, 1967, the Chairman,
Mr. T. J. N. Foley, said in his Annual Review.
The Group consolidated profit, before
taxation, but after providing $4,621,934
depreciation, was $15,528,517. This compares
with the figure of $14,585,887 for year ended
31st October, 1966.
Income Tax required a provision of
$6,720,024 leaving a Group profit, after tax,
of $8,808,493.
The amount of Group profit attributable to
outside shareholders in subsidiary companies
was $232,405, with the result that the profit
after tax belonging to shareholders of British
Tobacco Company (Australia) Limited was
$8,576,088.
Mr. Foley’s Review continued:
A final dividend of 6% on Ordinary and ‘B’
Ordinary shares was paid on 11th January,
1968, which, with the interim dividend of 6%
previously paid, maintains the total dividend on
Ordinary and ‘B’ Ordinary shares at a rate of
12% for the year.
Revenue Reserves and Undistributed Profits
showed a net increase of $4,213,354. This
resulted mainly from retaining $3,856,899
operating profit and $671,655 profit on the
sale of fixed assets offset by various adjust-
ments, the principal one being a transfer of
$217,555 to capital reserves following changes
in shareholdings in subsidiary companies.
This year’s profit, being a further advance
on the previous year, affords a degree of satis-
faction, but it reflects only in part the progress
which is being made by the British Tobacco
Company Group in the implementation of its
long-term plans for the reorganisation of overall
activities.
W.D. & H.O. WILLS (AUSTRALIA) LIMITED
The largest subsidiary, W.D. & H.O. Wills
(Australia) Limited, recorded a further increase
in profit, sales and share of market. This
performance occurred during a year which once
again was marked by most intense competition
in all sections of the industry.
Your Company continued with its policy of
market development and also introduced a
number of new brands designed to keep pace
with moves by competitors and, where possible,
to anticipate changes in types and packings of
cigarettes which might be favoured by
consumers.
LEIGH-MARDON PTY. LIMITED
The instability of some sections of the printing
and packaging industry was again a disturbing
feature of 1967 trading, with the result that
higher overall sales were accompanied by lower
margins of profit in these sections.
However, in total, the profit for the year
remained satisfactory, but a close examination
of the less profitable areas of Leigh-Mardon
activities has been carried out and has resulted
in' a streamlining of the total operation, from
which benefits are expected to flow in the
future.
During the year, a somewhat complex finan-
cial operation was undertaken, whereby the
activities of Dodge Consolidated Industries, in
which company Leigh-Mardon owned a majority
of shares', and those of Fibre Containers
Limited, were amalgamated.
In the process, Dodge Consolidated Industries
Limited became a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Fibre Containers Limited, which company, in
turn, became a subsidiary of Leigh-Mardon Pty.
Limited.
Both companies have demonstrated their
individual vigour and resourcefulness in the
past, and it is confidently expected that the
amalgamation of these enterprises by an
exchange of shares will create one of the largest
and most successful units in the corrugated
container industry, with long-range benefits to
shareholders.
ASSOCIATED PRODUCTS &
DISTRIBUTION PTY. LIMITED
In this Company, manufacturing and market-
ing food and beverages, the year has been a
mixture of progress in the development of a
sound management organisation and of costly
action in correcting inefficiency in some of the
manufacturing and trading units, even to the
extent of eliminating completely a number of
activities which the management and Directors
were convinced could never, in the light of their
past achievements, be expected to perform satis-
factorily.
In the Soft Drinks Division, all companies
have been successful in increasing sales, and
our share of the overall Australian market has
shown an advance.
The Snack Foods Division has also had a
considerable improvement in sales performance
and, at the same time, benefited greatly from
improved efficiency in manufacturing.
The major problems have occurred once
again in the Frozen Food Division, but some
corrective actions have already been taken in
this Division.
Further steps were achieved in the ice-cream
industry. In April 1967 Devondale Holdings Pty.
Limited was acquired; in July 1967 the balance
of the shares in Toppa Holdings Limited was
bought, and in the same month, Diamond Foods
Ltd. commenced ice-cream production in
Western Australia.
These moves have enabled the Company to
obtain a considerable share of the total market
in Australia for ice-cream, but for the greater
part of the year extreme price competition
caused the trading results of our subsidiaries,
and of many other companies in the ice-cream
industry, to be far from satisfactory.
So serious was the position that common
sense at last prevailed, and in recent months
there has been some lift in prices of ice-cream,
which has made profits possible once again.
The Dairy Frost business is now confined
to marketing the product through machines in
fixed locations in retail shops, and in these
outlets encouraging increases in sales have been
effected.
We are now satisfied that the risk element in
Dairy Frost has been eliminated and the
company is organised to operate efficiently and
profitably in future years.
In the fresh and frozen poultry industry, the
Company’s subsidiary, Diamond Foods Ltd.,
has been operating successfully in Western
Australia for some years.
A further major step in the industry was
made during the year when a 40% interest in
Golden Poultry Farming Industries Limited, the
largest producer of poultry in Victoria, was
acquired.
This move has brought us into a joint opera-
tion with Messrs. J. and R. Ingham, the owners
of the other 60% of Golden Poultry Farming
Industries Limited, and whose organisation,
Ingham’s Enterprises Pty. Limited, is the
biggest and most efficient in the Australian
poultry industry.
Since our new association with Ingham's
was formed, Golden Poultry has purchased
Windsor Poultry Service Pty. Ltd. and Wy
Wurrie Hatcheries in South Australia.
As a result of these developments, your
Company has now secured a substantial interest
in the poultry market in the southern States.
The most difficult section of our diversified
activities, and one which is still causing your
Directors a great deal of concern, is the frozen
vegetables section.
Both our subsidiary, Frozo Food Company
Proprietary Limited and our 50% partnership
venture with Sou-West Frozen Food Packers Pty.
Limited, have recorded again substantial losses
during the year.
The situation at Frozo has been under
constant investigation, and it was decided at
the end of the financial year to purchase the
remaining 40% of this company in order to
institute drastic corrective action aimed at
longer term efficiency and a return to profitable
operations.
(Solution of a legal problem involving the
Company and Sou-West Frozen Food Packers
Pty. Limited was announced by Mr. Foley at
the Annual General Meeting of shareholders on
7th March, 1968.)
Warning must be given that even when this
deadlock regarding share ownership and
management is solved (in Sou-West), a lean year
must be faced in 1968 arising from crop failures
due to drought conditions in the vegetable
growing districts of Victoria, upon which both
Frozo and Sou-West companies depend for their
supplies of peas.
Drought has' been a very detrimental factor
for two other company activities also. Although
Thomas Playfair Proprietary Limited achieved
profit in 1966, the shortage of meat supplies at
prices suitable for overseas markets has caused
losses in line with the experience of most other
meat processing companies.
It is only in the last three months that
conditions have changed sufficiently to allow
Playfairs again to contribute to overall group
profits.
As would be expected, Naroo Pastoral
Company Pty. Limited was again affected by
drought conditions in some areas of New South
Wales.
In summary, the year for Associated Products
& Distribution Pty. Limited has been one of
difficulty and poor financial results.
This has been due in part to the special
circumstances of the frozen food industry, but
also to the deliberate plan of curtailing or
terminating unfavourable enterprises which was
forecast at this time last year.
We have the satisfaction of knowing that
many of the basic trading problems involved
have been at least minimised for the future.
Progress has been made in Melbourne with
the development of Courage Breweries Limited,
in which British Tobacco Company has a sub-
stantial interest.
The construction of the new brewery has
commenced and it is expected to be in production
by the summer of 1968.
ANNUAL MEETING
In his address to the Annual General Meeting
of shareholders on 7th March, Mr. Foley, re-
ferring to Sou-West Frozen Food Packers Pty.
Limited, said:
“When the printed Report and Balance Sheets
were prepared, it was necessary to advise you
that the disagreement which has been in
existence with the partner in Sou-West Frozen
Food Packers Pty. Limited had not yet been
resolved, and that legal proceedings had been
set in motion which would shortly lead to a
Court hearing.
“In the past few weeks, it has been possible
to negotiate a solution to this problem, which
is about to lead to a purchase by Associated
Products & Distribution Pty. Limited of the
other half of the shares in Sou-West Frozen
Food Packers Pty. Limited.
“As part of the negotiated settlement, Mr.
J. T. Savage, who has been Managing Director
of Sou-West Frozen Food Packers Pty. Limited,
while remaining a Director of that Company is
now about to take up an appointment as Market-
ing Adviser to the Group in the Frozen Foods
Industry, and we are confident that with the
whole of our operations in frozen foods under
the one policy control, aided by the co-operation
and marketing experience of Mr. Savage, it
will be possible in the longer term to combat
more effectively the many difficulties which exist
in this vigorous, but as yet unsettled, industry.
‘The past 12 months has seen a further steady
increase in the overall volume and the share
of the market held by our cigarette brands,”
continued Mr. Foley, “and although the com-
petition has been severe, as illustrated by the
quite unusually large numbeb of new brands
introduced . to the market, the results of the
first four months of the year give every indica-
tion that the situation can be maintained.
“Such improvement, coupled with a progres-
sive solving of the problems in the food and
beverage industries, leads us to anticipate an
even better performance during the current
year,” he concluded.

No, it’s not back to
Fortress Australia
COMMENT
BY
DONALD
HORNE
NOW THAT Australians have begun
to realise that American policy in South-
East Asia could be disposable, Australia
may have to make a change in its con-
cept of its place in the world almost
as fundamental as it had to make at
the end of 1941 and the beginning of
1942. At that time the Japanese des-
truction of colonial power in South-
East Asia blew away the basis for the
belief that the world was British and
that our participation in the world
including our ultimate prospects of
defence was through our member-
ship of the British Empire. From that
time forward, in real terms, the world
became for Australia not British but
both Asian and American. Because of
our position on the map, our view of
the world must remain Asian for the
rest of our history. But for how long
must it also remain American?
It is not possible to answer the ques-
tion. It is not within our capacity to
affect political events in America, and
those events are in themselves un-
predictable. There is nothing particu-
larly shameful in this. It is simply a
condition of our existence, going beyond
our necessary friendship with America
and alliance with her, that what Ameri-
can Governments decide to do in South-
East Asia has an effect on South-East
Asia, and therefore on Australia, that
it is finally beyond our power to control
and beyond anyone’s power to predict.
It is also a condition of America’s
existence that while American decisions
about South-East Asia undoubtedly have
effects on South-East Asia, these effects
may not always be the effects America
intended. For this reason, despite Presi-
dent Johnson’s latest moves, there is no
particular reason to assume that the
Vietnam War will now end. It might
get hotter, or, while continuing, it
might get colder. What happens in
Vietnam is decided not only in Wash-
ington but in Hanoi and Saigon. If
the Hanoi Government wants not only
to win South Vietnam but to humiliate
America, the war is more likely to
grow hot than to grow cold. If the
Hanoi Government wants to win South
Vietnam, but is prepared to let America
save face, it could do so, in a series of
conferences, coalitions, and com-
promises that might last for several
years, with a final subsidence of power
in Hanoi’s direction. Whether American
leadership becomes hawk-like, or dove-
like, or ostrich-like depends partly on
such other factors, and their interaction
with the demands of American politics.
For all we know, America will be-
come more committed in South-East
Asia than ever. But it also seems wise
to imagine situations in which America
might become less committed, or might
cease to be committed. There is no
point in exact predictions. Flow far
would America disengage? As far as
Thailand? As far as the Malay Archi-
pelago? As far as Australia? As far
as Japan? The questions have no mean-
ing. They depend on future circum-
stances we cannot comprehend. The
only point about the questions is that
they are now being raised.
For Australia this means that we
should not go on assuming that
American engagement will continue to
exist in its present form. It might. It
might not. Why, therefore, base policy
completely on the assumption that it.
will? But to acknowledge this is not
to say the opposite. It would be even
more senseless to base policy completely
on the assumption that the Americans
will lose all interest in the Indo-Pacific
area. Our policy should be of a kind
that would make sense in relation to
these two contradictory assumptions,
and to the possibilities in between.
Even in taking the extreme view of
South-East Asia as a natural disaster
area, there is no inevitability that a
pessimistic view is more likely to be
proved true than an, optimistic one.
A complete, obvious, and humiliating
American defeat is not likely, but, if
it happened, this would probably be
disastrous to at least mainland South-
East Asia. But there are degrees in
pessimism. Consider what might happen
with a lesser failure. What would be
the effects if the North Vietnamese
won, but in a gradual kind of way,
from some situation of American face-
saving compromise in which power ac-
crued to the North Vietnamese bit by
bit until they felt confident enough to
start that imprisonment and slaughter
of their opponents which would repre-
sent their victory?
What then? For one thing, a change
in world opinion: many of the op-
ponents of present American policy
might by this time feel somewhat un-
easy in their consciences and this
might have effects we cannot yet
imagine. But this might not stop Hanoi
front further rounding out the satis-
faction of its pride by taking over Laos,
and perhaps Cambodia. With world
opinion further affronted, what further
ambitions is Hanoi likely to have? They
are not likely to go farther than North
East Thailand, but by this time it
is possible that Hanoi will have indiges-
tion. In any case, Thailand is not Viet-
nam: It could, however, adopt a kind
of neutralist position, similar to Cam-
bodia’s now. (What would that mat-
ter?) Beyond North-East Thailand, it
is the policy of China that matters to
South-East Asia, not that of North
Vietnam. If America proved itself a
paper tiger, the Chinese might, most
likely and most easily, interest them-
selves in Burma, at least for a start,
and perhaps with some success, but
not without further affronting India,
and perhaps arousing in other nations,
Indonesia in particular, a fierce resolve
of a kind that would develop its own
momentum.
To say that developments such as
these are possible is not to predict
them, but to suggest that they are the
kind of possible developments that
should be taken into account along
with possibilities such as a South Viet-
namese victory on the one hand or a
collapse of South-East Asia on the
other, and a whole range of accom-
panying possibilities in American en-
gagement or disengagement. To accept
all of these contradictions as possibilities
is to get away from the stultifying sim-
plicities that are involved in assuming
that either everything remains as it is,
or it’s back to Fortress Australia.
The basic assumption in Australian
foreign policy and military policy since
1942 has been that, so far as we are
concerned, America Will Be There. We
should now stop seeing this as a self-
evident total truth, a sure remedy for
all possible situations. It is as false a
view as our earlier view that Britannia
Ruled The Waves. But to reject it as
a total, universal truth is not to reject
our alliance with America. Alliances are
not made in heaven: they are not
divinely perfect, but they are some-
times as good as men can make them.
We should assume that our alliance
with America is in this category. Our
policy should allow both for its con-
tinuance and for its discontinuance.
And the same goes for that other
new strand in Australia’s concept of
itself recognition of its geographical
position as a neighbor of South-East
Asia. We have grown a long way since
we saw Asia as an entity, as if it were
just one thing, and its significant rela-
tion to us as that of a threat. Our
relations with a number of countries in
Asia, particularly in South-East Asia
and East Asia, if they accelerate at the
present rate, within a generation or so
are likely, more than anything else, to
give a finish to that sense of nation-
hood without which life often does not
seem fully convincing. Just because
some terrible things might happen in
parts of South-East Asia is no reason
for sounding a general retreat. As with
our relations with America, our policy
toward South-East Asia should allow
for a whole range of possibilities.
So far as trade is concerned, it can
be assumed that we shall go on selling
to anyone who doesn’t forget his money.
So far as foreign policy and military
policy are concerned, we should work
from a basic framework that allows
both for an American alliance and no
American alliance, for a spectrum in
American engagement in the Indo-
Pacific area that ranges from the present
position to nil, and for a range of pos-
sibilities in South-East Asia, some of

which are optimistic and some pessi-
mistic.
This means that for the first time
in our existence we should feel like a
nation that is not only allied to a great
power but that is also on its own, so
that in military planning, for example,
we make decisions about equipment
and training not only on the basis that
we are a gallant little ally, but on the
basis that in our own region we might
sometimes proceed independently, and
on the further basis that, in some posi-
tion of future and indeterminate catas-
trophe, we would be expensive to take.
How' to be an ally is something that
w'e understand, and if we think we are
incapable of making ourselves a nation
that it would be- expensive to take
w-e should have a look at the armed
strength of Israel or Sweden. What
seems hardest for Australians to imagine
is the middle possibility that we
are neither a gallant little ally nor a
beleaguered island, but a power of
credible military strength playing a role
in its own region. Yet this would now
seem the role w r e should most prepare
ourselves for.
If military planning were on such a
basis, it is obvious that decisions about
equipment should not be keyed
exclusively to our role as an ally, if
this conflicts with the aim of acquiring
a credible military strength in our own
region. This is extremely significant,
because it might mean that w'e can get
more for our money. We do not have
to keep up with the Americans, but to
be as good as we have to be in our own
region. So far as men are concerned,
we are left with a series of possible
positions. If Australia were itself in
some danger, w r e w'ould have to become
a nation in arms. As things stand we
can get by with a great deal less than
that, but with something more than W'e
have now'. It might soon be time to con-
sider the possibility of widening the
National Service intake, but of intro-
ducing choice, so that young people
would have at least the initial option
between military service, enlistment in
a kind of overseas peace corps, or work
in national development in Australia.
How'ever, w'e should not get into a
panic. The principal use of our mili-
tary strength should be to give us
choices and credibility in foreign policy,
and for this purpose economic policy
and economic assistance are for the
moment even more important than
military strength. In this connection we
must at once give up the humbug that
in our own region we are a small
power, or a non-pow'er, incapable of
action without big brother. To suggest
this is to betray a selfish ignorance. As
The Bulletin has already said, we
should remember that our Gross
National Product is greater than that
of Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia, and
the Philippines combined. In the region
where w'e live, we are an economic
super power.
Backed by credible military strength
and economic pow'er, our foreign policy
should concentrate on the development
of regional security arrangements be-
tween ourselves and our immediate
neighbors. In fact this is our present
policy, at least as it is expressed by
the Minister for External Affairs, al-
though on this question the Prime
Minister is ambiguous: but this policy
is not backed by credible military
strength, nor by a deployment of eco-
nomic power.
To begin with we should take things
as they come. It is said to be our
policy to wait for initiatives to come
from the area. If this is our policy
we should respond to initiatives when
they do arise. The principal Indone-
sian initiative is that the pragmatists
now' in power in Djakarta w'ant more
economic assistance: w'e should give it
to them. The principal initiative from
Singapore and Malaysia is that these
two nations want assistance in building
up their defences after the British leave:
w'e should give it to them. (The exact
form of assistance is a matter for
discussion.) And when there are oppor-
tunities for wider initiative for co-oper-
ation in the area, we should take them.
By playing a confident and energetic
regional role w T e w'ould both allow' for
the continuance of American engage-
ment and for its discontinuance. We
would be applying a policy that is
likely to encourage the Americans to
maintain some interest in an area that
is engaging in self help, that might
encourage the interest of other powers,
and that could also be continued with-
out American interest. One of the
strengths of such a policy is that it
is concerned with a part of the world
that is made up mainly of islands.
It is not mainland Asia. It is true that
West Malaysia is a peninsula, but it
is connected to Asia by a nai'row'
isthmus that makes it a kind of
honorary island; Indonesia is made up
of about 3000 islands; the Philippines
of about 7000; and Australia is the
world’s biggest island.
By developing its military and de-
ploying its economic strength, Australia
can assist in the development of some
feeling of mutuality and confidence in
this oceanic w'orld that would make
sense both in terms of the American
alliance, and without it; it w'ould allow'
for exactly the kind of disengagement
that has been so far discussed in
America, w'hich has been a departure
from mainland Asia rather than from
the world; it would allow for the
possibility that things could go w'rong in
parts of South-East Asia without going
wrong everywhere in South-East Asia;
and it would not conflict with that
ultimate concern of any nation the
maintenance of its own sovereignty.
It would be by such an approach
that Australia would really “be keep-
ing its options open.” Keeping options
open does not consist of doing nothing:
it consists of w'orking out a policy that
might suit many different kinds of
circumstances and then putting that
policy into effect so that it provides
a basis for decisions in reacting to
events.

AUSTRALIA
Canberra reacts with anger and
apprehension
AS PLANES flew in from various
States, each bringing its sprinkling of
politicians to Canberra for the pre-
Easter Week of Parliament, the talking
point was the forthcoming redrawing
of Federal electoral boundaries, an ex-
ercise which directly affects the poli-
tical future of most parliamentarians.
Only with such fundamental chitchat
over did they have time to speculate
about Lyndon B. Johnson’s decision not
to run again for President, and his de-
cision to scale down the war in Viet-
nam.
On the Labor side, for all but the
most bigoted of Left-wingers (who
saw it' as a public-relations hoax),
there was a gloating enthusiasm which
saw a vindication of Labor policies. It
was mainly on the other side of the
House that there were ’more sombre
thoughts.
In Cabinet, relations with, and con-
fidence in, the United States have
deteriorated seriously 1 this year. The
events of last week only added to the
growth of doubt about future U.S.
foreign policy. On the one hand, the
U.S. was putting pressure on Australia
to involve herself more deeply in
South-East Asia (by giving money to
Indonesia, troops to Malaysia), on the
■other hand, the prospect of an indefin-
itely continuing U.S. military role in
Asia was diminishing.
Coming so soon after the Communist
Tet offensive and accompanied by
LBJ’s stand-down decision, the private
Government view is that the Americans
are negotiating from a position of
weakness. “If we heard General Giap
had been kicked upstairs, that President
Ho Chi Minh was resigning and that
North Vietnamese troops were being
cast in a less active role in South Viet-
nam, and that the Hanoi Government
was praying for us to come to the con-
ference table, we would think they
were finished”: was one frequently re-
peated theme. AH those Liberals who
have so glibly been speaking of a poli-
tical settlement or a negotiated solu-
tion and who were happy to do so as
long as any such thing was well out of
sight, were starting to worry about
what negotiations 'might lead to.
'ln Cabinet the reaction was a
mixture of anger and apprehension.
Prime Minister Gorton publicly tried
to play down the whole business. He
went out of his way to select for
emphasis those sections of the Presi-
dent’s speech which spoke of continued
resolution and the determination to
avoid a “fake solution.” He refused to
concede that there was any difference
between this “de-escalation” and the
many previous bombing pauses. He
enunciated a completely new principle
of limited consultation with the U.S.
Prime Minister Gorton meets U.S. Secretary of State Dean Rusk at Fairbairn
airport, Canberra, on Friday.
in saying that he only expected con-
sultation when there was a develop-
ment “which requires Australia to make
some additional effort.”
Defence Minister Fairhall and Ex-
ternal Affairs Minister Flasluck were
privately angry that they had been so
left out on the limb by the Americans
following their previous week’s state-
ments against a bombing halt.
One External Affairs Department
view is that as long as negotiations are
between the North and the U.S., their
course is pretty straightforward, some-
what along the following lines: In
return for cessation of the bombing, the
North could agree to reduce its offen-
sive operations in the top two provinces
of South Vietnam. Further mutual
North Vietnam-United States de-
escalations could be negotiated inform-
ally, understandings about refraining
from attacks on certain U.S. bases,
matched by the absence of sweep opera-
tions in Communist staging areas.
Next, there might be agreement on
mutual proportional withdrawals, the
Americans and the North taking divi-
sions of troops out of the country one
by one.
But the really tricky issue arises when
the indigenous armed forces of the two
sides become a subject for negotiation.
The U.S. cannot go against the desire
of the elected Government of South
Vietnam in formally recognising the
Viet Cong National Liberation Front.
That elected Government cannot be ex-
pected to accept the NLF as an organ-
ised force, or else the NLF will cer-
tainly destroy all non-Communist ele-
ments and take over total power. The
optimists a’mong the Australian Gov-
ernment’s advisers say that the indigen-
ous Viet Cong are so weakened by
military failures that they can be easily
dealt with over a period of time by
the Government of South Vietnam
alone, even though the Allies have
been withdrawn. The pessimists believe
that the present elected Government
may collapse through a failure of
morale or have to be pushed over in
order to achieve a settlement a'mong
the indigenous forces. They argue that
our position is so weak that all we
can settle for is a chance for the non-


Communist elements of a coalition to
resist a Communist takeover from
within a coalition.
Whether they like him or not, among
parliamentarians, Bobby Kennedy
appears to be the betting favorite to
succeed LBJ. Richard Nixon is not
far behind. It is generally agreed that
a second President Kennedy would be
most reluctant to exercise American
power in Asia, and that bilateral and
SEATO alliances would be further
deprived of meaningful content. And
even if Nixon should be elected, quot-
ing his article in The Bulletin
last year, they say that America would
only commit forces to the Asian area
in the event of significant local support
and co-operation.
It is at this point in the defence
argument that two completely different
propositions are stimulated. Everyone
in the Government parties agrees that
the old view of the American alliance
(as something which requires syco-
phancy in policy statements and token
support forces in return for ultimate
protection) is increasingly misleading,
Gorton and. Hasluck .. .waiting for
Dean Rusk and, perhaps, reassurance
but there is confusion and uncertainty
as to the appropriate Australian re-
sponse.
A large group (which sometimes in-
cludes Mr. Gorton, Mr. McEwen, and
Mr. McMahon) is tending toward a
policy of avoiding any further Asian
commitments. In private conversations
“retraction” is the new in-word, and it
implies the possible abandonment of
commitments to Thailand, a search for
a breaking down of the commitment to
Malaysia-Singapore, and reluctance to
spend money in Indonesia. “It’s quite
remarkable how many of my col-
leagues are talking Fortress Australia
this week,” said one of the critics in
the Liberal Party. A bizarre variant of
the theme of quietly abandoning Asian
connections is the suggestion that Aus-
tralia team up with South Africa and
Rhodesia advocated by five or six
Liberal parliamentarians.
Mr. Gorton when in New Zealand
evidently told Mr. Holyoake that Aus-
tralia was only committed to maintain-
ing a military presence in Malaysia
until 1971, when the British left. He is
understood to be considering that unless
sufficient support is forthcoming from
Britain and the other countries, Aus-
tralia and New Zealand should with-
draw troops from the area, although
providing training and assistance. That
is in complete contravention of the
External Affairs-Hasluck line, which
has it that the British withdrawal is
irrelevant to Australian policy and that
we are firmly committed to maintaining
a military presence at the request of the
Malaysian Government.
Mr. Gorton is inclined to go easy
on commitments and to question
“forward defence strategy,” perhaps
holding Australian defence forces solely
for use against direct armed attack on
our mainland or its territories. But Mr.
Fairhall and Mr. Hasluck, supported
by what appears to be a minority, argue
for more vigorous efforts and initiatives
by Australia to build co-operation and
mutual defence arrangements among
the non-Communist countries of South-
East Asia. They describe as defeatist
the view that the dominoes must inevit-
ably fall and that Asia is finished to
quote two favorite phrases of Fortress
Australia proponents. In this they are
vigorously supported by the Democratic
Labor Party, on whose votes the Gov-
ernment usually gets elected.
The two lines within the Government
Parties are not yet clearly drawn, but
debate rages. Last week the Govern-
ment members defence committee was
taken over by the Fortress Australia
men, with the defection to that camp
of Senator Magnus Cormack and
others. But the Asian-Alliance men are
coming back, and on behalf of them
General Wilton, chairman of the chiefs
of staffs committee, is being invited to
address the parliamentarians’ com-
mittee in the near future.
Only the Labor Party in its self*
congratulations appears unconcerned
and out of this great debate.
Labor policy
Shifting stances
by ALAN REID
FROM NOW until November 5 and
probably so'me time longer, Washing-
ton, not Canberra, will be Australia’s
real political capital. Upon the Presi-
dent that is elected then will turn not
only the shape of Australian govern-
mental thinking on international affairs
and defence but also the shape of con-
flict between the political parties in
Australia.
If you look back over the 13 years
since the emergence from Labor’s
troubled womb of the Democratic
Labor Party, with the exception of
1961, an election fought on domestic
issues and a temporary recession which
saw the Menzies Government returned
with a floor tnajority of one in the
House of Representatives, national elec-
tions have been contested on external
policies. Boiled down, the thinking and
approach which produced years of
glittering electoral success for the
Liberal-Country Party coalition and
continuing rebuffs from the voters for
Labor (whose divided condition
stemmed basically fro’m disagreement
on foreign policies) were—
• Tq survive securely in this troubled
portion of the globe, Australia needed
“great and powerful allies,” viz the
United States and Britain.
• Sooner or later Britain would with-
draw from South-East Asia (as it
turned out it was sooner than later)
leaving the United States as the only
“great and powerful ally” left in the
area.
• If the United States retreated back
into isolationism, Australia would in
a defence sense be lonely and isolated.
• It was worth so’me sacrifice for
Australia to encourage the United
States to stay in Asia and not feel that
it alone was left to bear the Asian
burden.
"• The American alliance was all-
i'mportant to Australia’s future, any-
thing that jeopardised it (such as
Labor’s 1966 proposal to withdraw
Australian troops from Vietnam)
should be rejected nationally.
President Johnson’s announcement of
peace overtures (on a basis which has
overtones of the conditions that the
ALP said in Adelaide must be 'met by
the United States unless a future
Labor Government was to withdraw
the Australian commitment to Viet-
nam) has introduced new elements.
Despite what Opposition Leader
Gough Whitlam has urbanely claimed,
Labor was prepared to place the United
States-Australian alliance at risk to
get out of Vietnam. This was an im-
portant political factor in recent Aus-
tralian election results. But what if the
United States isn’t in Vietnam? or is
trying to get out? Labor’s Vietnam
attitude would no longer threaten the
Australian-U.S. alliance. What factor
would then divide the parties?
If President Johnson’s successor ex-
ploits the weariness and disillusionment
of the Americans, then the Australian-
United States alliance could become a
mere formality rather than a safe
shield as the Menzies and Holt Gov-
ernments held it to be. It would not be
Labor but the United States that would
be rejecting the alliance.
This is only an extreme possibility.
Despite its disillusionment with its role
of world policeman (never a happy
lot) it is doubtful whether any U.S.
President would retreat completely into
Fortress America, or even to a position
where America’s external preoccupa-
tions were restricted to Europe.
But a partial American retreat might
bring Labor’s Dr. Jim Cairns more into


his own. Cairns could have been fore-
casting some of the shape of things to
come in a speech in the House of
Representatives on October 21, 1964.
“I think the general policy of con-
tainment is a sound policy,” said Cairns.
“But the question is—where?” Cairns
went on to say that he considered in-
sufficient consideration had been given
to where was the best strategic point to
make this containment.
“As far as the Pacific is concerned
it is clear that it is somewhere along
the 5500 mile line from Kamchatka,
north of Japan, to say Darwin in the
south, and then to the east and west.
Its features are that this is essentially
an air and sea line of defence. It is not
a land defence like South Vietnam. I
believe the predominant and proper
consideration by American generals
over the past 20 years is that it is fatal
to become involved on the land and
that essentially the strategic line of de-
fence is where General Macarthur said
it was in 1949 something like the
line I have defined. I think Australia
should take part in defence on this
line.”
But that is just one possibility. By
the time the Democratic and Repub-
lican conventions gather to elect their
Presidential nominees in August, John-
son’s peace efforts may have failed be-
cause of ■ the intransigence of Hanoi.
The hawks might by then be proved
correct in their reiterated declarations
that Hanoi has no interest in peace,
only in victory, and that as a con-
sequence the only way the United
States, unless it proposes to dishonor
commitments, can secure peace is to go
full out for victory. They, rather than
the now seemingly triumphant doves,
could be the ones expressing the
majority convention sentiment. In that
case there would be a return to as
rigid a difference between the Aus-
tralian political parties as previously
existed.
One thing appears likely. Failing an
economic recession of a major kind
(and the indications are that the Gov-
ernment, having learned its lesson from
1961, won’t let this happen) foreign
affairs are likely to continue as the pre-
dominant factor in Australian elections
—only more so than ever.
Tariffs
Mellow McEwen
MR. McEWEN, continued last week
breathing fire at his personal enemies
while acting with quiet restraint in
’matters of policy. Parliament was
treated to more episodes in the very
unexciting saga of “secret Japanese
agent” Max Newton with story-teller
McEwen emotionally rising daily to
his feet to make more “revelations”
about the rather ordinary activities of
the Canberra journalist. But the normal
Tariff board chairman Rattigan ...
signed on for another five years
Mr. McEwen, Trade Minister Mc-
Ewen, was quite cool and purposeful.
It was generally agreed in the Gov-
ern'ment that except in one respect he
was not letting his emotions run away
with him. (That respect being his con-
demnation of Japanese car firms before
the charges have been heard in court.)
In saying that the first intention of the
Department was to ensure that the
Japanese were not dumping cars here
by faking cost figures, and only later
look at the case for higher protective
tariffs, he was moving toward middle
ground politically and away from his
fiercely aggressive protectionism.
“It is part of the Government’s tariff
policy that reasonable competition from
overseas is healthy and in the interests
of the consumer and the economy. In
moderation and on a fair basis it will
produce sound development and the
growth of this key industry.”
He also backed away slightly by
disclaiming any Government respon-
sibility for difficulties which firms have
got themselves into by making wrong
investment decisions: “It is not our
policy to dictate who should or should
not manufacture (in Australia) or what
share of the market any one company
should or should not get. The forces
of competition must determine this
within a private enterprise and profit
framework.” This expression of com-
petitive free enterprise thinking will re-
assure many of Mr. McEwen’s Liberal
colleagues who have grown increasingly
concerned at the Trade Department’s
detailed interference (and inept inter-
ference at that) in the workings of the
car industry.
And despite the fact that Tariff Board
Chairman Alf Rattigan continued his
moves to reform tariff-making in the
face of Departmental hostility, he was
reappointed for a further five-year
term. In an important speech in Syd-
ney to Metal Trades employers Ratti-
gan showed he was completely un-
intimidated.
And finally the Trade Minister in-
troduced into Parliament three Tariff
Board reports —all of which recom-
mended the status quo in tariffs —
and accepted them fully.
The Press
Paper darts
IF THE GOVERNMENT is as good
only as its Opposition, there is not much
hope for the West. But hope has been
lifted considerably by a new form of
“opposition” arising a more healthily
critical attitude by West Australian
Newspapers, the State’s daily newspaper
monopoly. In recent years the papers
have become increasingly unwilling to
wave the Government banner, and this
has lately reached the point where it
was acknowledged only grudgingly be-
fore the recent election that the Gov-
ernment that had brought about such
changes in the State should be given
the chance to continue the work. The
newspapers, not the opposition, are
groaning over the State’s growing pains;
and the administration is having trouble
adjusting to this new form of opposition
which it sees as destructively critical.
The casualties of progress have
everything to gain. Their problems are
distilled most obviously in the housing
crisis. Young couples are unable to pay
the “renting fee” (alias key money)
and the rent for flats and houses which
has more than doubled in the past 10
years. The prosperity backlash through
such people hit the Government so
hard in the urban electorates that until
voting was well advanced it seemed the
majority might drop from eight to one;
as it was, marginal seats went the Gov-
ernment’s way and the final majority
was five. -
Since the Western Australian develop-
ment boom began, the Government has
been criticised for pandering to com-
panies, particularly overseas companies.
That it has survived this criticism is
due largely to the remarkable working
partnership of the Premier, Mr. David
Brand, and the Minister for Industrial
Development, Mr. Charles Court. While
Mr. Court has been willing to stir
things up, Mr. Brand has been equally
adept at pouring oil on the troubled
waters.
An issue that, has been taken up
strongly by West Australian Newspapers
both exemplifies this change and arti-
culates the community’s long-standing
unease with certain Government atti-
tudes. Western Mining Corporation is
building a nickel refinery at Kwinana.
As part of its deal with the Government,
it was guaranteed that the necessary
land would be available. This under-
taking was spelt out provocatively as
soon as the project was announced.
Land is an emotive subject in Perth,
and it has been seen as indicative of
the Government’s relative attitudes that
the supply-and-demand machinery
should be tampered with on behalf of
Western Mining Corporation while it
could not be on behalf of young people
wanting to set up homes.
As the “West Australian” sees this:
“For all its protestations of concern for


the public interest, the State Govern-
ment generally makes everything else
subservient to industrial needs, which
apparently are more important than
democratic principles ... In the final
extremity, compulsory acquisition might
be warranted if one or two landholders
stood out against the company and
their refusal to sell jeopardised the fut-
ure of the refinery. But there should be
no intimidatory talk now of land re-
sumptions . . . The eagerness to help
gianjt industries get land cheaply is in
sorry contrast with the Brand Govern-
ment’s failure so far to do as much for
citizens who want to build a home. It
would be different if the community
interest were involved; wresting land
from private citizens for a public pur-
pose is sometimes justifiable. But the
land seizures would be for a multi-
million dollar company.”
The editorial adds that it is especi-
ally disturbed about Mr. Court’s ex-
David Brand. ..more ,oil needed
planation that “he can tell the town
planning authority to implement a
political decision by drawing up a con-
trived improvement plan making
resumption possible ahead of ratifica-
tion of the .agreement by Parliament.”
The Government justified land re-
sumption by pointing to the benefits that
will percolate through the community,
not only in new jobs created but
through such by-products as fertilisers
which could not be produced so econ-
omically unless the nickel refinery were
sighted within the Kwinana complex.
This reasoning has been swallowed for
many years but never quite digested.
The newly stepped-up campaign to
emphasise individuals rather than the
State (through industrial development)
will be welcomed by Western Aus-
tralians. If it is also acted upon by the
Government, a team of good developers
will have become a good government.
Life in Darwin
Hot under the
collar
IN DARWIN’S 90-deg. heat this week,
a lot of people were feeling hot under
the collar for reasons only indirectly
connected with the steamy weather.
Darwin’s waterside workers and some
2000 blue-collar Government employees
are complaining that they are being
asked to bear too big a share of the
white man’s burden in the North.
Both groups are demanding an extra
week’s leave, air fares south every
two years, and some of the other hand-
outs the Administration accepts as the
price of keeping its white-collar staff
happy on the job in Australia’s front-
door Public Service.
Already the Public Service Board
has turned down the blue-collar
workers’ demands for air fares south
every two instead of three years, and
extra leave, but the Watersiders’
Section of the North Australia Workers’
Union is keeping the fight alive with
a threat to boycott Darwin stores and
business houses which do not agree to
their requests. And since support for
the watersiders could mean tacit
approval of the same concessions for
about 3000 workers employed by its
members, the Employers’ Association
can’t at present feel its lot is a particu-
larly happy one.
Reinforcing the wharfies’ stand on
the air-fare privilege is the fact that
it already extends to all Government
workers, even Territorians born and
bred, who live there with their
families. Some of the Territorians,
incidentally, have their own peeve
that they can’t take the cash instead
of the trip. But “expatriates,” instead
of flying off to the beckoning delights
of Sydney, Melbourne, or other points
south, sometimes have the best of both
worlds by boarding a bus and pocketing
most of the air fare.
In other ways, too, Darwin’s lower-
paid workers think it’s high time the
Government took some of the heat off
them. They look with envy at the air-
conditioned luxury of large, three-
storey buildings in Mitchell Street
where hundreds of clerks and admin-
istrative grades work, sip tea, fetch and
carry files at a steady, if not an inspired,
pace, in a carefully controlled 75 degs.,
and put on pullovers and complain if
the temperature falls a degree or two.
Some workers outside the Government
bank staffs, executives, and some
key men in building and industry —•
get special allowances, air-conditioning,
and free flights, though not many. Most
of the “outsiders” have reason to envy
those who receive a district allowance—
the one concession in which the Gov-
ernment’s 5000 blue- and white-collar
workers have equality. For married men
it is $620 a year, for bachelors $4OO, a
compensation for the climate and other
regional hardships, notably a cost of
living which is 25 to 30 percent higher
than in southern capitals.
Living costs are high because of the
scarcity of accommodation, Darwin’s
perennial headache, and here again the
degree of the grouch depends on one’s
place in the pecking order in a com-
munity that, in its comparative crudity,
is an outback parody of the Canberra
situation. For those way down the line,
rents of up to $4O a week are common,
and hundreds of families live in cara-
vans that cost $2O a week and make
family life a mockery.
At the head of the line, the senior
public servants in the professional and
administrative grades have the best of
it. Nearly every one of them has a
Government house, rented for as little
as a tenth of salary, as an encourage-
ment to the pioneering spirit. Non-gov-
ernment workers cannot apply for a
Government house.
Blue-collar workers and temporary
public servants can apply for Housing
Commission accommodation, which
rents for between $9 and $ll, or about
one-fifth of the average worker’s wage.
Even single Government workers get
concessions which make their equiva-
lents outside the Service feel victimised.
The Government Employee, man or
woman, pays $3B a fortnight for full
board at a Government hostel. A pri-
vate worker, if he is lucky enough to-
get it, pays $2O a fortnight more for
the same roo : m, the same food, and the-
same old, tired cut lunch.
Low-rental houses and flats are, in
fact, available to less than one in four
of Darwin’s 23,000 citizens, and the
demand seems nowhere within sight of
being overtaken -by the present building
program.
Tire of grumbling about rents, and
there’s always the price of food
apples and pears each 35 cents a lb.,
overland fro’m Adelaide, lettuce 45 to
50 cents, airfreighted from Sydney or
by road from Adelaide, or “home-
grown” which means 100 miles down
the Stuart Highway at Adelaide River
cabbages at 20 cents a lb. Recently,
the Assistant Administrator of the Ter-
ritory, Mr. E. F. Dwyer, blamed re-
tailers for high mark-ups on fruit and
vegetables, but they said he was irres-
ponsible and ignorant of heavy spoilage
costs.
Swan beer is locally produced, but
Victorian bottled beer co'mes in by road.
Freight is charged to the customer on
all types of liquor, as well as a per-
cent levy payable to the Administration
by wholesalers. Beer sold “cold” is
5 percent dearer.
Liquor is the biggest single item in
most housewives’ budgets. As one said,
“What with the heat and no television,
there isn’t much else to do except invite
your friends in for a drink.” She admit-
ted her week’s bill for liquor was $lO.
Let the bread price creep up, fruit
and vegetables get dear, but if anyone
starts tampering with the liquor prices
there’ll be a bellow that will make the
wharfies’ present complaints sound like
a whimper.

OVERSEAS
The ordeal of
Lyndon B. Johnson
“TPIERE IS division in the American
house now. There is divisiveness among
us all tonight,” said President Johnson
before announcing that, in consequence:
“I shall not seek and will not accept
—the nomination of my Party for an-
other term as your President.” Thus
the man whose main concern when he
ca : me to the Presidency was to establish
a consensus among the American
people is now giving up the job in
order to re-establish that consensus. Mr.
Johnson’s retirement is being hailed as
a great sacrifice. It may be so; he is a
proud man. But there is no doubt that
the decision has been long matured and
was finally announced with relief. For
all the suspicion that he may yet suc-
cumb to a popular draft if his policies
succeed while his rivals tear the Demo-
cratic Party apart, Mr. Johnson is best
taken at his word.
It is generally accepted in Washing-
ton that the main factor in the Presi-
dent’s decision was the realisation, from
the public and private opinion polls,
that he would have to fight hard to get
his Party’s nomination in Chicago next
August, that then he would probably
lose the election and that possibly an-
other Democratic candidate might win
it. It is an ignominious admission for
a man who, only a little over three
years ago, was elected with the biggest
popular 'majority in American history.
He recognises, with his usual
decisiveness and courage, that he him-
self, if not the cause, is undoubtedly the
catalyst of the divisions that now en-
danger his country. And if he, the Presi-
dent of all Americans, were to fight a
personal campaign in the summer and
autumn, those divisions would be deep-
ened and he himself would find it even
harder than it will be anyway to do
the unpleasant things that must be
done. In his address, and in some of his
remarks since, he even seems to be
suggesting that no American President
should descend personally into the
political arena to run for re-election
after his first four-year term.
The President had been left with
little or no freedom of action, even in
domestic affairs, as a result of the
demands of the Vietnam war. His
particular frustration has undoubtedly
been his inability to build on the foun-
dation of creative social legislation,
passed during the inspiring first year
after his 1964 triumph. Mr. Johnson
may still be remembered as a famous
reforming President. The first South-
erner in the White House in modern
times, he achieved a breakthrough in
legislation to guarantee Negro rights
and also a breakthrough in health in-
surance, until then the notorious gap
in the American welfare system. But
financial stringency, in the midst of the
greatest prosperity America has ever
known, prevented him from assuaging
his genuine and practical compassion
for the poor with any really satisfying
improvement in their lives.
The unprecedented bitterness which
has been spreading through America is
explained by all of this and, above all,
by the fact that the man who promised
peace if he was elected in 1964 has
found himself responsible for a painful
and ever more intensive war. Maybe
Mr. Johnson might have held the
sympathy of the country if he had been
less secretive, particularly with the
Press, less of an alien Texan in sophisti-
cated Washington, a less stubborn and
complicated character. Be that as it
may, he lost touch with the people and
was no longer giving his country the
leadership it wanted. But once he
decided to leave the White House he
did it in a characteristically brave and
constructive way.
As well as the Vietnam War there is
an almost equally divisive issue at home
crisis on the city streets, already
burst. Here again a President running
for re-election might have found him-
self inhibited from taking the painful
steps —calling out the Army, firing on
the rioters—that become necessary to
restore order because he was depen-
dent on Negro votes in the cities. Or
he might have found himself tempted
to be unfair to the Negroes and their
liberal sympathisers, in order to appease
the white militants.
The third critical sector of the
American scene, and one where it is
also helpful for the President to be
above the election struggle, is the whole
economic complex—deficits in the dom-
estic budget and the balance of inter-
national payments, tax increases, price
inflation, wage demands, and the
blatant need for much more money to
be spent on the social deficiencies of a
country which is in most respects over-
supplied with goods and services. Here
the President is dependent on Congress,
but his influence with the legislators
should be increased, for a time, by their
admiration for what to them seems
almost incomprehensible abnegation in
giving up voluntarily the greatest politi-
cal job of them all. But it will be long
before Mr. Johnson’s new prestige is
submerged in Congressmen’s practical
calculations that they have to get re-
elected next November, while he does
not and that when they have been
re-elected he will no longer be there.
Meanwhile, however, President John-
son has recovered his moral authority,,
in a dignified and moving manner that
has made some people wish that he
were not bowing out. His Presidency
has been characterised by a Roose-
veltian belief that the United States
should not again be an inward-looking,
protectionist, and isolationist society.
He inherited the postwar American
role of international policeman and
provider at a time when American
power \itself and the cohesion of
America’s alliances were both on the
turn; and his test came in the one
corner of the world where American
power had been most challenged. By
committing American power unreserv-
edly to Vietnam and failing not only to
win outright military success but to
carry American public opinion with
him, Mr. Johnson has come to
jeopardise many of the international
causes that he wanted America to stand
for. Pie is now set on repairing this
damage by using the influence and
credibility of the Presidency in a way
in which it has not been exploited
before.
There are two ways of looking at
what President Johnson has set out to
do: the optimists’ way, and the pessi-
mists’. It is not yet possible to say
which is the right one. Too much
depends on things that are known only
to Mr. Johnson, and on some other
things that even he cannot know yet.
What can be said is that, if the most
pessimistic interpretation is right, the
United States may be about to lose
the position it has held since 1945 and
the world is heading into a period of
greater danger than anything it has
known for the past 20 years.
This interpretation is that Mr. John-
son has thrown in his hand, abandoning
both the Presidency and his whole
Asian policy in one grand Wagnerian
act of renunciation. He might have
done this because he is now genuinely
convinced that the reasoning which led
him to send an American army into
Vietnam in 1965 was mistaken, and
that he must expunge this mistake even
if it means ending his own career and
badly damaging the credibility of his
country’s alliances around the world.
But the more likely explanation of this
act of renunciation is that, while he
himself is still convinced that what he
has tried to do in Vietnam is right, he
has concluded that the majority of
Americans now want peace without
thinking too much at the moment about
the international price. So he is giving
it to them. This is a very black interpre-
tation indeed. It is the belief that he


is about to accept defeat against his
own better judgment.
But there is also an explanation that
allows for a little more optimism. This
is that Mr. Johnson has not thrown
up his hands in despair; that he is still
trying to end the Vietnam War on
terms that would not amount to an
American defeat; and that he is using
the renunciation of the Presidency to
help him to try to achieve this.
Take the hopeful interpretation first.
Any attempt to work out what lay be-
hind his speech on Sunday night must
start with the military analysis that has
been sitting on Mr. Johnson’s desk for
the past couple of weeks. It is a bleak
analysis, and it made a new approach
to the war unavoidable. When General
Giap launched his offensive throughout
Vietnam on January 30 many people
thought that his aim must be either
to capture the American garrison at
Khe Sanh or to take and hold a num-
ber of the towns he attacked. It was
assumed that, if he achieved neither of
these things, he would be back where
he had been before the offensive and
would have taken a packet of casualties
into the bargain. Where this assessment
went wrong was that, although General
Giap neither took Khe Sanh nor per-
manently occupied a single town, he
tilted the military balance heavily in
his favor by taking and holding large
parts of the countryside. The Americans
now seem to believe that they cannot
restore the situation to what it was
before January 30, at least in the near
future, unless they send something like
another 200,000 soldiers out to Viet-
nam. Mr. Johnson has decided that
neither his balance of payments nor
the temper of American opinion will
allow this. He must make do with
the present army, plus a modest rein-
forcement of about 25,000 extra men.
This means changing his military
strategy.
This military analysis must be set
alongside a reassessment of the political
situation in Vietnam. There are still
not many people outside the Com-
munist world who believe that the
National Liberation Front really speaks
for the majority of South Vietnamese,
in the sense that most South Vietnamese
want the sort of government they will
get if the NLF takes over power in
Saigon. The most that can be said is
that the state of bruised neutrality to
which the bulk of the population has
been reduced helps the guerilla tactics
of the Viet Cong more than it helps
the uniformed, regular armies of the
defending forces. But this is important.
The National Liberation Front has
demonstrated that it has the active sup-
port of a fair number of Vietnamese.
It has also demonstrated, at least for
the coming months, that many of the
rest are no longer willing to oppose it
at all actively. This is bound to be
reflected in the settlement that ends the
war.
In a political settlement, Mr. Johnson
knows the odds are stacked against him.
North Vietnam said on Wednesday that
it was willing to talk, but only about
a way to stop the bombing of the
north entirely. Even if that can be
settled, the real issue remains. There
are very great difficulties indeed in the
way of setting up any coalition govern-
ment except the sort that the Commun-
ists would use to push their way into
full power. To try to negotiate in these
circumstances is a formidable problem.
The one thing that may still make it
worth trying, and which may have
tempted Mr. Johnson into having a
shot at it, is the fact that some Euro-
pean Communists have lately been
dropping hints to the effect that the
North Vietnamese and the NLF are
willing to be unexpectedly conciliatory.
No doubt all this has reached Mr.
Johnson. He knows perfectly well how
dangerous it could be to put his trust
in this advice from North Vietnam’s
friends. It could turn out to be pure
banana-skin. But he may have decided
Johnson with Averell Harriman (left) . and
Llewellyn Thompson, his peace negotiators
that, in the situation that he faces after
General Giap’s offensive, he has no
choice.
'And if he is going to try his luck
with negotiations he knows that re-
nouncing the Presidency will give him
some important advantages. It means
that he is presenting his own head on
a platter to Ho Chi Minh. Whatever

for whom face is important, that is
quite a victory It might help them to
quite a y. e . f .
be more accommodating m the nego, -
aliens about South Vietnam which is
what really matters for the Americans.
It is just possible. Mr. Johnson also
knows that he can settle down to the
business of hard bargaining without
having to worry how every rumor from
the negotiating table will affect his
chances at the polls. If he is getting
ready for a serious negotiation and
not just for a disguised capitulation
it will certainly help to have insulated
himself from the election,
This is the most optimistic interpre-
tation of what Mr. Johnson is doing,
There is nothing in what the North
Vietnamese have said in public to
support the belief that they are ready
to talk about any sort of settlement
except one that will bring the Corn-
munists to power in South Vietnam in
pretty short order. They may have
been toying with the idea of settling for
less than that before General Giap
launched his attack in January. They
have much less reason to be toying with
it now. They have said they are willing
to talk if the bombing comes to a full
stop. But it is quite possible that they
will steer the talks away from any
issue of substance except the timetable
of an American withdrawal,
This is the second possible explana-
tion of why Mr. Johnson has detached
himself from the Presidency and
offered to negotiate. He knows that

They might find American public
opinion turning around in its tracks
and deciding to elect a megahawk. And
by renouncing his own candidacy, Mr.


Johnson will have ensured his freedom
of action to deal with this new crisis
as toughly as he likes, without worrying
about votes.
Both these interpretations have one
thing in common. They assume that
Mr. Johnson is still in the Vietna'm
game; that he wants to hold out for
a settlement which will not deliver
South Vietnam to a Communist
government; and that he is freeing
himself from American politics in order
to give himself a better chance of get-
ting that sort of settlement. But this
is not what 'most people instinctively
thought he doing when they
watched him on television or read his
speech. It is not how General de Gaulle
appears to have seen it.
The first reaction of most people was
that Mr. Johnson had decided that he
could no longer pursue the war for the
purpose he had set himself in 1965.
The majority of the American people,
or at any rate the 'majority of the
Democratic Party, seemed to be in the
process of making it plain that they
On Thursday the President went to the United Nations
for talks with Secretary-General U Thant
wanted peace more than they wanted to
keep South Vietnam out of the hands
of the Co’mmunists. Rather than split
his Party and risk a national crisis, Mr.
Johnson was bowing to the call for
peace. He might privately intend to
get the best terms he could from Ho
Chi Minh. But the essential will to
continue the war had been broken. The
United States had agreed. to negotiate
in the aftermath of a military reverse.
Sooner .or later, if the North Viet-
namese pressed home their advantage,
they would get an American with-
drawal on the terms they wanted.
This could be right. President John-
son is a battered man. For the past
two years he has been abused, in a
manner that has sometimes recalled
the McCarthyism of the 1950 s except
that this time the abuse has come from
the Left, for having drawn the logical
conclusion of his predecessors’ policies
toward South-East Asia. It has been
enough to bludgeon any man. And the
Americans are a battered people. They
are the first people to have engaged in
a major war, and watched its hojrors
on television, without having their Gov-
ernment impose any significant limita-
tions on their freedom of inquiry and
debate. They have seen the latent anti-
Americanism of envious countries that
are less successful and less free seize on
this chance to attack them. Their direct
national interest in South-East Asia is
minimal: their economy would hardly
be affected if the area had never existed.
And yet they have been assaulted as the
monsters of the 1960 s for having gone
to war to protect southern Asia from
an influence they believed to be inimi-
cal to its future development. It would
be no wonder if their will, and Presi-
dent Johnson’s, had broken.
It is no small thing when the main
centre of power in the democratic
world loses its nerve. What has hapi-
pened in America since the New Hamp-
shire primary is not unlike what hap-
pened in Britain in the Fulham by-
election of 1933. At both times an
“I’m going back to the
land,” he announced
electorate that disliked the issue im-
mediately before it rearming against
Germany in 1933, the casualty lists
from Vietnam now voted against
the immediate unpleasantness without
fully realising the effects of its decision
on the wider issues involved. The
effects came after 1933; the collapse of
British will led to the appeasement of
1938 and the beginning of 1939. They
will come now, and not just in South-
East Asia, if the withdrawal of the
American Army from Vietnam is fol-
lowed swiftly by the emergence of a
Communist government in Saigon.
At the least, the Americans are now
putting themselves in the way of ex-
periencing the failure, perhaps partial
but perhaps worse than that, of the
policy that took them to Vietna'm in
force. It looms, indeed, as the first
major failure of their protection of
allied or client States since 1945. The
really important consequence of Viet-
nam is not the effect the fighting itself
has had on the Americans, which is
the effect it always has on a civilised
people, but the effect the result of this
war will have both on the Americans
and on those who consider themselves
the Americans’ adversaries.
If the United States was increasingly
reluctant to make good its com'mit-
ments to other allies, in a situation
where the number of calls on these
com'mitments was increasing because
the enemies of America’s friends were
emboldened by an undisguisable Ameri-
can failure in Vietna'm, the con-
sequences would spread far beyond the
South-East Asian peninsula. There is
no such thing as a defeat without con-
sequences.
This is something the men who-
would like to take over the White
House next January are thinking about.
Senator Kennedy, for example, will not
want to preside over the erosion of the
American position in the world. Nor
will he want to be obligated to take
drastic and possibly highly dangerous
measures to restore that position. He
has already drawn back fro'm some of
the things he seemed to be saying a
couple of weeks ago. If Mr. Kennedy
wants to be the next President he
knows that it is in his interest that
President Johnson should not simply let
the Communists achieve their original
aims in Vietnam and then sit back and
watch the ripples spread out into Laos,
Cambodia, Thailand, and beyond. The
negotiations that are now beginning
are likely to be long ones. A very great
deal rests on how the American people
react not just today but six months
and even a year from now. They have
said they want' peace. They may not
have 'meant that they want it on the
terms President Ho Chi Minh may still
try to insist on. There is a long, way
to go yet.
Vietnam
Whose war is it?
PRESIDENT JOHNSON’S speech has
once again rubbed home the unplea-
sant truth that the South Vietnamese
have lost control of what some of them
still like to believe is their own war.
Washington is said to have consulted
with Saigon two days before Mr. John-
son spoke. But since President Thieu is
known to favor continued, and even
stepped-up, bombing of the north,
people conclude that South Vietnam’s
word counted for little in these con-
sultations.
For several months the shrewder
members of the Saigon Government
have been wondering how. much longer
the war could drift along without the
Americans losing patience or South
Vietnamese apathy becoming too great.
The Tet offensive added enormously to
the feeling that so'mething drastic had
to be done. But for most officials and


politicians in Saigon this does not mean
negotiations. Few people believe that
the non-Communists could hold their
own politically with the Viet Cong if
the fighting were to stop soon. Even
those who favor negotiations admit that
they would be running a big risk. The
difference between the’m and the others
is that they are ready to run the risk.
President Thieu, at a hastily called
Press conference last week, gave a
special twist to President Johnson’s
gesture. In effect he presented the
partial bombing pause as Hanoi’s very
last chance; a failure to take the
chance, he suggested, would justify new
military measures. He was equally
tough in insisting that Saigon would
deal only with those members of the
National Liberation Front who came
over to its side under the “open arms”
program. This seems to rule out, for
President Thieu at least, any chance of
bringing the Front as an organisation
into South Vietnam’s legal political
life. Later the South Vietnamese senate
endorsed Mr. Thieu’s opposition to a
coalition with the Co'mmunists. Though
American officials in Saigon keep quiet
on the subject, those who would like
to see negotiations started have a more
flexible attitude to the Front than this.
For the moment, Thieu can rally
people with the promise of meting out
dire punishment to Flanoi should the
agreement to talk about talks prove
abortive. But if it becomes clear that
America does not plan to follow up
such a failure with a bigger war there
will be anger and dismay both inside
and outside the South Vietnamese gov-
ernment.
There has been a growing willing-
ness to criticise America in South Viet-
nam since the American presidential
primaries began and opposition to the
war took on more palpable shape.
President Thieu has to take care that
the anti-American feeling does not pick
on himself as a target. Although he in-
sists that his relations with the vice-
president, Marshal Ky, are excellent, the
more emotional and impulsive Ky is
the obvious standard-bearer for anti-
Communist Vietnamese enraged by a
shift in American policies.
South-East Asia
Weighing the risks
From Harvey Stockwin in Kuala Lumpur
A WEEK in which the bombing of
North Vietnam was severely limited,
though not as much as originally
indicated, in which Washington and
Hanoi both moved toward the negotiat-
ing table, and which ended with Khe
Sanh ceasing for the time being at least
to be the Dien Bien Phu of 1968 in-
cvitably sent a perceptible shudder
of apprehension through South-East
Asia, causing many to furiously calcu-
late and recalculate the future.
After all, what was there to negotiate
about? Johnson’s statement naturally
created uncertainty, if only because
peace talks would not seem likely to
be productive unless one side or the
other has changed its mind. Beyond
this there was the question of motive.
Had Johnson given up Vietnam as well
as the Presidency? Or had LBJ really
given up either? Was he still out to
defeat the Viet Cong or was Kennedy
the main objective? Was the President
wearied by the Presidency or was he
trying to salvage something from the
wreck before the drift of American
politics dictated a different direction?
These were undoubtedly the leading
questions being asked in the region this
week. No doubt its symbolic ending
with Johnson staying at home because
of prior concern over the aftermath
of Dr. Martin Luther King’s assassina-
tion made many wonder as to the
eventual outcome.
Given the largely unexpected shock

pull out militarily and leave us to look
after ourselves . . . we should project
and prepare our plans on the basis that
South-East Asian countries will have to
hang together, and if they are not pre-
pared to do it, then I think they must
hang separately,” noted Singapore
Foreign Minister Rajaratnam a fort-
night ago this week Singapore
leadeis vveie conspicuously and signifi-
cantly without official comment.
Feai that domestic pulls and pre-
occupations would accelerate American
isolationism in Asia were forcefully
expressed by Thai Prime Minister
Thanom Kittikacliorn on Monday
when he openly feared a Kennedy
Presidency would result in the United
States abandoning Asia. “If that
happens, no one wall ever trust the
United States again,” he said.
Hanoi’s counter-statement on Wed-
nesday scarcely clarified the situation,
since while the paragraph accepting
talks was eagerly noted elsewhere here
note wots also taken that the acceptance
came at the end of a typically intransi-
gent statement on the righteousness of
Vietnamese National Liberation. Thus
essentially South-East Asian worries
revolve around two doubts and two
questions. The doubts are whether
Johnson can or will accept a coalition
formula or whether Ho Chi Minh will
accept tw 7 o Vietnams. Consequently, will
negotiations lead to a Korea-type
solution or wall they produce a face-
saving formula for a Communist take-
over? As ever, Malaysian Prime
Minister Tunku Abdul Rahman
retained faith in Western purpose, wdiile
indicating the difficulties and his
worries. While hoping for peace and a
Vietnamese respite from fighting, the
Tunku suggested “whatever may be the
terms for the Cessation of war no party
should feel that there has been any
honor lost.” But will they? The Tunku
expressed the dilemma “between the
tw r o ideological camps into which the
Vietnamese people are divided . . .
There can be no true co-existence” —•
as well as the hope that “they have no
other choice but to try to get along
. . . We all pray there will be a
change of heart.”
Obviously, too, an unstated Asian
query this week was the extent to
which the superpowers could pressurise
such a. change. After all, was Russia
the pipeline through which Hanoi got
the talks message and consequently
“ignored” continued bombing south of
the twentieth parallel?
Abdicating the Presidency, had LBJ T
in effect, retained the crucial ability to
do very unpopular things should nego-
tiations prove pointless? Certainly the
relief of Khe Sanh suggests without
proving that the dropping of more
bombs in that area than in the whole
of World War II on the whole of Japan
had its effect.
Thoughts such as these undoubtedly
relieved some South-East Asian anxiety
as the turbulent week ended, making it
possible for those who have gambled
on the logic of American power and
commitment continuing to assert itself
to feel that the gamble might still come
off.

Hands across the Tasman
The Nordic Council as a model for Anzac co-operation
“‘PUT IT out of mind,” said Prime
Minister, Mr. John Gorton, when the
old perennial—federation between Aus-
tralia and New Zealand —was raised
during his visit to New Zealand. Put
out of mind it will be, although it never
goes away entirely; there is always some
politician or pundit to parrot about it.
However, what seems permanently
out of mind is intelligent discussion on
the development of multi-level relations
between Australia and New Zealand
along lines which would have relevance
to today and tomorrow, which might
save both countries money by pooling
of resources and which might establish
a style in international co-operation
which could, in time, be a useful ex-
ample to neighbors of both countries.
There are few countries with so
much to ensure close and fruitful rela-
tions as Australia and New Zealand.
Apart from the Anzac tradition, they
have the same origins, the same lang-
uage, even much the same accent. They
look alike, mainly live alike. Yet there
are few neighbors more apathetic.
The basic mistake may be that talk
of co-operation always begins at the
top, with political union or a common
market, instead of at the bottom, on the
person-to-person level. The suggestion
of political union brings oiit New Zea-
landers’ mistrust of Australians, and
freer trade, Australians’ impatience with
a country which can’t make more
headway than New Zealand.
In recent years the Nordic Council,
the attempt by Denmark, Norway,
Sweden, Iceland, and Finland to achieve
closer co-operation at many levels, has
grown in strength and effectiveness.
Perhaps this is a model of what Aus-
tralia and New Zealand should be do-
ing.
The Nordic Council does not seek
to eliminate national identity. Member-
ship does not rule out other interna-
tional alliances. Co-operation is con-
sidered most valuable on a person-to-
person level: Icelapd with a population
of 200,000 already has more than 150
organisations concerned with Northern
co-operation. Membership is not on an
equal footing: the Council has 69 voting
members—five from Iceland and 16
from the other countries but be-
cause it is a consultative body, voting
strength is not all-important.
The Northern countries established
their council with some formidable ob-
stacles to overcome, there is no common
language (Finnish is totally different);
member countries do not have the same
racial origin; they have fought against
each other more often than side by
side; they are conscious of belonging
to mainly large, sparsely populated
countries of difficult terrain. (The com-
bined populations of the Northern
countries is about 20 million.)
The Council has so far not achieved
any major objects: there is no common
market and no common defence. Yet
the member States believe that the
Council has been a great success.
It was asssumed from the beginning
that foreign policy and defence would
be barred from discussions of the
council. However, Left-wing members
have, in recent years, tended to raise
some such questions, including a plan
for a nuclear-free Northern Zone.
Australia and New Zealand, if they
undertook something similar, would
obviously have a head start. They
would even have no trouble with an
acceptable name which would be readily
recognisable elsewhere. It could be the
Anz.ac Council, or the Tasman Council,
or, even, if it were enlarged later to
take in New Guinea and the islands of
the South-West Pacific on, perhaps,
initially a similar basis to Iceland in
the Nordic Council, as the Oceanic
Council. Australasia should definitely
be forgotten.
• A good example of the practicality
and flexibility of the Nordic Union is
the Scandinavian Airlines System. Den-
mark, Norway, and Sweden decided
they were not big or wealthy enough
each to run an international airline.
(Finland and Iceland decided they were,
but they had in mind only restricted
and not world-wide routes, so they fol-
lowed their own wishes.) SAS was
established and remains the largest inte-
grated enterprise in the north.
When one remembers the expensive
struggle which Qantas has had to estab-
lish its odd and unevocative name with
such advertising whimsies as “the non-
U airline” and remembers TEAL, in a
similarly extravagant way, turning it-
self into Air New Zealand, it is irre-
sistible to feel how sensible it would be
for both countries to go into the super-
sonic age with Air Anzac.
It seems probable that higher tech-
nology will force greater co-operation
on us, ready or not, as it is already
doing with that most expensive item,
defence. For example, the British Con-
ference Lines which, since 1882, have
enjoyed a monopoly in the shipping
of New Zealand products to Britain,
are extremely doubtful whether a direct
container service to New Zealand would
be economically feasible. The Confer-
ence Lines say they want “further in-
vestigation to evaluate a New Zealand
container service in relation to services
to other areas where containers are be-
ing, or may be, introduced.” This could
mean that New Zealand goods will be
transhipped through Australia.
Probably one of the reasons why Aus-
tralians and New Zealanders know and
understand each other so little is that
in generations past New Zealanders’
lines of communication with what
seemed the entire outside world was via
Panama while Australia’s was via Suez.
The Nordic Council grew out of the
earlier Nordic Inter-Parliamentary
Union. It got going in 1953, but Finland
did not come in until 1955. The Council
differs from earlier international bodies
in that government representatives share
in its debates on the same terms as
members of parliament. Each country’s
representation is expected to reflect the
state of parties in its own parliament.
Most political party leaders are mem-
bers of the Council.
The Nordic Council tried hard to
establish a Northern Common Market.
It failed, mainly because of complex
factors outside its control. However, it
then took off in other directions. Some
of these have been:
CUSTOMS: Passports have been
abolished for nationals of any of the
five countries for travel within those
countries. But, of course, no passports
or health checks are needed between
Australia and New Zealand. Where the
Nordic Council has gone further is in
simplifying customs procedures and
making them uniform in the five coun-
tries. Visitors complete formalities for
customs, passport, and quarantine only
at the point of entry and exit to the
Northern countries.
TRANSPORT: SAS, already men-
tioned, is the largest single achievement
in co-operation. However, another result
of the Nordic Council was Sweden
switching to right-hand driving on the
roads. Iceland, although she doesn’t
present the same problem, also intends
to switch to the right.
COMMUNICATIONS: The Nor-
thern countries are, broadly speaking,
one postal and telegraph zone. There
are special low rates for automatic tele-
phone calls, telegrams, and other tele-
communications between the Northern
countries.
MARITIME: Reciprocal concessions
are allowed to coastal vessels of the
Northern countries. There is co-opera-
tion in meteorological services and in
ice-breaker and sea-rescue work. It is
hoped eventually to standardise all mari-
time regulations.
LABOR: The Northern countries may
not have been able to get fa:r with a
common market in trade but they have
established a common labor market.
This followed abolition of passports.
Effectively, Australia and New Zealand
have a common labor market. However,
in the Northern countries this is tied
to labor exchanges in each country.
Most transfers of labor between one
Northern country and another are now
made through these so that it is no


longer necessary for unemployed people
to go looking for jobs at random.
Sweden was the chief attraction for
workers, but the Council believes that
the general level of prosperity is so
high, partly because of the Council, that
emigration is levelling out.
THE LAW: The aim is to achieve
equal status for all Northern nationals.
The five countries have passed legis-
lation providing for extradition. There
is co-operation between the police in
methods of detecting crime. One of the
amusing consequences of co-operation
has followed the provision that an offen-
der, convicted in a country not his own,
may go to jail in his own country. It
was found that criminals tended to
gravitate toward those countries with
the most comfortable prisons; now they
face being sent home to comparative
discomfort.
SOCIAL SECURITY: The Northern
countries have had reciprocal social
services since 1955, although discussions
on the subject go back to 1907. How-
ever, a reciprocal agreement between
Australia and New Zealand goes back
to 1943. The Northern countries are
now working toward parity in social
benefits and their
agreement includes
some things not yet
in the Australia-
New Zealand one.
For example, no
person can evade
either family re-
spo n s ibilities or
maintenance pay-
ments for children
born out of wed-
lock by moving to
another Northern
country.
MEDIC INE:
The Northern
countries are now
working toward
ma k ing medical
prescriptions accept-
able in any of the
five countries. They already have a joint
pharmacopeia. The countries also co-
operate in compiling medical statistics
and in the examination of processed
foods. Medicine is a field in which there
Is enormous person-to-person contact
between the five countries. Medical
workers have inter-northern conferences
and publish joint medical journals.
Australia and New Zealand have
some joint medical associations, such as
the Australasian College of Surgeons,
but there is almost no move toward
statutory uniformity along the lines the
Northern countries have taken.
CULTURE: The Northern countries
believe that it is in culture, in its widest
sense, that contacts between people are
greatest and co-operation most fruitful.
Danes, Norwegians, and Swedes can
understand each other’s spoken langu-
age without much trouble. Drama com-
panies can tour, poets can give recitals
In adjoining countries without difficulty.
Television and radio, organised through
Nordvision, help familiarity with the
spoken languages, but most books are
still read in translation.
Small changes have also been made
j n spelling to try to break down the
difference between Danish, Norwegian,
and Swedish.
The Nordic Cultural Commission is
the largest co-operative body after the
Nordic Council. It is a highly represen-
tative body of Government-appointed
members representing every cultural
activity and divided into sections for
science, education, and the Arts. Work-
ers in the Arts, radio, and television
have their own Northern organisations
with regular meetings and exchanges of
ideas.
At the Venice Biennale Finland
Norway, and Sweden have built a joint
pavilion “Scandinavian” design has be-
come a generic term and the Northern
countries have benefitted from this by
arranging joint exhibitions of their
work for showing overseas. At present
a joint exhibition of Scandinavian art,
sponsored by the Peter Stuyvesant trust,
is touring Australia.
SCIENCE: Science, ever increasingly
expensive, offers endless opportunities
for co-operation among the Northern
Prime Ministers Holyoake and Gorton get together, but after periodic official
visits the g ap across the Tasman yawns again
countries. There is a special co-ordinat-
ing body, Norforsk. This has, for ex-
ample, compiled a register of valuable
equipment, so that a research worker
in any of the countries knows where he
can find what he wants.
The Northern countries are begin-
ning effectively to split up their re-
search. Sometimes it is centred in one
country, sometimes it has branches in
each, and in some activity is co-
ordinated. There is the Nordic Insti-
tute of Theoretical Atomics in Copen-
hagen, the Nordic Maritime Institute
in Oslo, and Institute of Folk Literature
in Copenhagen. Finland is planning an
Institute of Arctic Medicine. Marine
biology "centres in Denmark, Finland,
Norway, and Sweden co-operate. The
Criminological Research Council in
Oslo allocates research projects to
scientists in all five countries.
The 82-year-old Australian and New
Zealand Association for the Advance-
ment of Science may be the oldest and
best-known organisation for co-opera-
tion between the two countries on a
person-to-person level. Also, at the
Association’s congresses, held every 18
months, political scientists and econo-
mists have, in recent years, raised new
ideas on co-operation between the two
countries.
Otherwise, the proceedings of the
congresses, as reported, seem to consist
of Australian scientists talking about
Australian proble'ms and being given
plenty of space in Australian papers,
and New Zealand scientists talking
about New Zealand problems and get-
ting a good run in their own papers.
However, the Association, although it
knows the directions in which it would
like to move, is hampered by lack of
funds. It receives no subsidies from
either the Australian or the New Zea-
land Government. It cannot sponsor
joint research. It encourages exchange of
scientists between the two countries,
although it cannot finance these moves.
EDUCATION: It is not intended that
education be identical in all Northern
countries. There is already uniform
matriculation to ensure that students
will be able to enrol at universities in
any of the five
countries. Some
faculties have al-
ready been inte-
grated.
In the schools,
the Northern coun-
tries seek uniformity
when it seems prac-
tical. A physics
textbook has been
produced which is
us ed throughout.
There is extensive
co-operation in the
design of school
buildings.
It is in education,
particularly tertiary
education, that the
magnitude of the
Northern countries’
achievement in co-operation seems most
striking. They have achieved a degree of
useful and intelligent uniformity that
Australia’s various States cannot man-
age. What hope does there seem of
working-in with another country?
The outside forces which are pushing
Australia and New Zealand closer to-
gether the British withdrawal from
South-East Asia, now, perhaps, greater
uncertainty about America’s future
plans in our part of the world are at
least as strong as those which fashioned
Northern co-operation.
All that is lacking is the desire to
understand each other. “There is no
doubt,” Noel McLachlan writes in the
current issue of “Meanjin,” “that what
we have in common is a truly breath-
taking ignorance of each other; and.
whatever is to be said for closer political
and economic association, this is cer-
tainly deplorable. For only by compar-
ing carefully our two countries and their
cultures can we hope to understand not
only each other but ourselves.”


The killing of Martin Luther King
A Memphis newspaper’s front page becomes a mourning placard
In Washington paratroopers move into help quell riots
POSSIBLY THE ONE Negro leader
the Americans couldn’t afford to lose
at this moment was Dr. Martin Luther
King. Committed equally to the
struggle for Negro emancipation and
against the war in Vietnam, he had
emerged from a period of eclipse as
the only potential mediator with suf-
ficient prestige to narrow the divisions
between whites and blacks, as well as
between blacks and blacks.
To reach this position of influence,
Dr. King had stood out deliberately and
courageously against many of his
closest friends. He took on the white
establishment, the black establishment,
and the black power militants.
His quarrel with the white establish-
ment was primarily over his decision
to oppose President Johnson’s Vietnam
policies. From being a favorite visitor
to the White House he found himself
totally excluded. Congress, too, turned
cold.
Many of his white liberal friends
turned against him because in 1966 they
were still ready to argue that the Civil
Rights movement should not become
mixed up in the Vietnam controversies
a position adopted also by the black
establishment. He angrily rejected the
arguments that black leaders should
forgo their duty to criticise American
foreign policies in exchange for possible
handouts for the ghettoes: “I can’t
segregate my moral concern. We are
engaged in a war where we are the
aggressors, and I think it’s necessary to
say to the policy-makers of our country
that we are wrong. We should admit to
the world that we made a tragic mis-
take in Vietnam.”
But the black establishment the
NAACP (National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People), the
Urban League, the Democrat and
Republican Negro politicians also
resented his refusal to work with them.
They felt not without reason that
Dr. King wanted to be the leading
figure in every action in which he was
engaged, leaving them to carry on
where he broke off the engagement. He
certainly had a great talent for captur-
ing the headlines and for attracting
huge financial subventions. And he had
no talent for building up an organisa-
tion. His flair lay in different directions.
His break with black power militants
like Stokely Carmichael and H. Rapp
Brown came over his dedicated refusal
to abandon non-violence as the only
method of struggle. To his last day his
lodestar was Gandhi.
Martin Luther King’s other ground
for opposing the black power militants
was because he felt their slogan offered
no constructive program of action. To
him, it was a “nihilistic philosophy
born out of the conviction that the
Negro can’t win.” While he understood
the reasons for the nihilistic reaction to
the intransigence of the white power
structure, he felt that black power
carried “the seeds of its own doom.”
He rejected black separation
although under the pressures of black
power he came to believe in transfer-
ring more political and economic power
into the hands of the ghetto-dwellers.
He insisted there was no answer to the
American dilemma other than com-
plete political integration and a shar-
ing of power.
But for the angry young Negro who
grew out of disillusionment of the
decade of civil rights Dr. King’s
recipe of non-violence and prayer was
not enough. His mother and grand-
mother had been praying to God and
singing lovely psalnis for too many
generations, without success, to en-
courage them to follow a leader who
was so essentially a man of the cloth.
They fell into the habit of referring
to King as “De Lawd.”
But it wasn’t only the young Negro
who had become enraged: the rage
had spread throughout the black
middle-class. The question was what
to offer people who were in a mood
for setting fire to the cities?
“It is purposeless,” King used to
argue, "to tell Negroes they shouldn’t
be enraged when they should be.
Indeed, they’ll be mentally healthier
if they don’t suppress rage but vent
it constructively and use its energy
peacefully but forcefully to cripple the
operations of an oppressive society.”
He was quick to see what the end
of the road was likely to be: “The co-
hesive, potentially explosive Negro com-
tnunity in the north has a short fuse
and a long train of abuses.”
The turning-point for him came in
Chicago in the summer of 1966 when
he was booed by his own people. “I
had urged them to have faith in
America and in white society. Their
hopes had soared. They were now boo-
ing because they felt that we were un-
able to deliver our promises. 1 went
home that night with an ugly feeling.”'
His response to the dilemma in which
he found himself how to reconcile
his own belief in non-violence with the
gathering 'mood of violence was to
escalate non-violence “by seeking to
make it as dramatic, as attention-
getting, as anything we did in Birming-
ham and Selma without destroying life
or property in the process.”
This is what he sought to do over
the strike of Negro dustmen in
Memphis, Tennessee, when he was
killed.
But it was not only his methods that
were becoming sharper: his attitudes
had changed, and with them his policies.
Reluctantly he came to accept the
late Malcolm X’s analysis of the
Negro’s place in American society as
being on a level of “domestic col-
onialism,” even more reluctantly he was
forced to agree that “most white
Americans are unconscious racists” —•
a view that has now been given the
stamp of establishment approval by the

The slain leader
Police guards on the balcony of the Memphis motel where a single shot killed Dr. King
Presidential Commission on Civil Dis-
orders.
“For years,” Dr. King said, “I
labored with the idea of reforming the
existing institutions of the society, a
little change here, a little change there.
Now I feel quite differently. I think
you’ve got to have a reconstruction of
the entire society, a revolution of
values.”
He even went so far for an
American as to advocate the possible
nationalisation of certain industries.
By transforming his own ideas and
sharpening the instruments of non-
violent challenge to American society,
he managed to do what the rest of the
black establishment had failed to do:
to speak in terms that found some
echo in the mood of the ghetto. And
even though black militants sharply
attacked him, they didn’t lose their
respect for him especially because of
his bitter attacks on the “American
disease of militarism.”
In responding to the changing
te'mper of his own people, Martin
Luther King found himself increasingly
divorced from the rulers at Washington.
But with the change of the President’s
policies on Vietnam and with a
greater awareness of the crisis at home
it seemed, for a brief moment, as
if King was about to reap the reward
for his courage in breaking with his
old patrons and friends.
Certainly if America was moving
seriously toward heeding the lessons
of the Commission on Civil Disorders,
it would need somebody like King to
act as a mediator between the white
and black establishments, the black
power crowd, and the ghettoes. The
bullet that struck him down on the
balcony of his Memphis motel has left
the Americans 'with nobody else who,
at the moment, can clearly fill this role.
Suddenly, the dangerous approaching
summer has begun to look even more
ominously dangerous.
The hunt for the killer
BARRING A RAPID arrest and con-
clusive evidence, the murder of Dr.
Martin Luther King now seems certain
to be engulfed by the doubts, suspi-
cions, rumors, and counter-theories of
elaborate conspiracy that followed the
assassination of President Kennedy.
Many Negroes here and elsewhere
including 'moderates are convinced
Dr. King was killed because his
marches were too dangerous to white
officialdom. That conviction may be
merely the predictable emotional reac-
tion of mistrust. But the gaps, evasions,
and uncertainties in the Memphis City
police version of how Dr. King died
are doing nothing to help remove it.
Neither is the absence of any statement
from the FBI of how its share of the
investigation is proceeding.
United States Attorney General
Ra'msey Clark, however arriving in
Memphis City on Friday said, “The
authorities are very close to the arrest
of the murderer.” Inquiries, he added,
had gone “several hundred miles” be-
yond State boundaries. There was no
sign of a conspiracy.
But time after time, in a two-hour
tour of the black housing areas of this
affluent 800,000-population city yester-
day, I 'met the familiar Dallas-type
story of the man who had warned
beforehand of a plot to kill Dr. King.
One of his close colleagues, the Rev.
Samuel Kyles, said today, “Memphis
police have been brutal to Negroes and
it isn’t hard for black people to believe
police were involved in the killing of
Dr. King. My personal belief is that
they were not.”
Kyles gave a clue to how the killer
or killers were able to plan the murder
so carefully. All day on Tuesday, he
said, the radio and television networks
were broadcasting that Dr. King had
arrived in Memphis and was staying in
room 306 at the Lorraine Motel. “It
bothered me a great deal.”
Police chief Frank Holloman said
that 30 to 35 police were guarding Dr.
King when he was shot. He amended
this later to 40 to 45—and added that
most of them were in cars. He agreed
this guard had not been provided on
Dr. King’s earlier visits to Memphis:
“The position had changed.” But there
had been no prior search “at least
not a search involving rooftops and
buildings.”
Holloman said Dr. King had been
met by police at the airport and
escorted to the motel but “I had no
definite evidence of any threat.” Police
said the killer stood in the bath of a
low-class lodging house opposite the
new motel and afterward fled down the
rickety wooden stairs and escaped. “He
just faded,” said Holloman. The wait-
ing police were on the scene “within
minutes.” They found a Remington
rifle. It has not yet been established
whether it was a bullet from this that
killed Dr. King.
Another familiar Dallas touch —• the
bullet’s trajectory emerges fro'm
police reconstruction of the killing. The
fatal shot appears to have been on a
downward diagonal of 205 feet through
a straggly screen of trees and scrub—
above the heads of the police guards.
Two local newspapers and the city
have now offered a total reward of
100,000 dollars for the arrest of the
killer. Police said that in the 24 hours
following Dr. King’s death there had
been 200 fires, 17 major, in the Negro
areas, 135 arrests had been made, and
25 Negroes and three policemen had
been injured in burning, looting, and
sniping.


Mr Butterfry
A SHORT STORY
BY HAL PORTER
WHEN, after eighteen years, I spot
him at the Lion Beer Hall, Shimbashi,
Tokyo, I suspect he is someone I knew
somewhere before, but it is hard and
unimportant to be certain whether he
really is that unplaceable someone or
merely a unit cut from the template
of his type. It is a type instantly
familiar because übiquitous as sinners
and dandelions, and almost invariably
wears the nickname Blue, despite the
fact that, in some tinkling and seemly
year, 1922 or 1923 say, a working-class
mother has fruitlessly attached to an
already wily clown of a baby the ticket
Oswald or Arthur or Francis Xavier.
Here, in the Lion Beer Hall, forty-odd
years after conning his way into and
out of the womb, he resembles his tem-
plate brethren to the last blackhead.
He is short, welter weight, discreetly
bow-legged, topped with ginger-and-
grey curls. Nickname? Guess!
Blue’s nose is snub as an ingenue’s,
and as immodestly open to the deli-
cious wickedness of the world as a
rocking-horse’s. His lips, too pliant,
scorched-looking, agitate themselves
non-stop to eject, in a falsetto of extra-
ordinary harshness, an overflow of
obscenity, boastings not to be believed
and not expected to be believed, lies
too Munchausen to arouse anything but
irritated pity, fly-blown witticisms, and
just enough tiny and tasty (and deli-
berately planted?) truths to make him
bearable, forgivable, even lovable. His
every clause— truth or tarradiddle or
downright delusion is accompanied
by a non sequitur gesticulation itself
in need of exegesis. His water-pale eyes,
nailed into all this restlessness and gar-
rulity, are immobile as an umlaut, un-
winking as a merman’s. An Australian,
a refractory, Depression-toughened,
war-jangled, Occupation-debased, he is
the oldest inhabitant of the Lion Beer
Hall.
For years eleven? fourteen? six-
teen? the Lion has been the weekly
rendezvous of expatriate Australians in
Tokyo. No need, of course, for a sign
BLOKES ONLY. Kangaroo-pelt koalas
squat on the newels of the staircase
and on top of the 1908 cash-register
ornate as a tsarina’s jewel-casket.
Qantas posters and elderly photo-
graphs of Sydney Harbor Bridge and
Murray River paddle-steamers hang on
the walls between dust-furred sprays of
salmon-pink plastic cherry-blossom and
the other-year calendars of Hong Kong
tailors.
It is behind waitresses of implausible
homeliness, and sluts with impasted
faces, frowsy false eyelashes, and
Elicon-inflated breasts that one queues
for a telephone-booth-sized lavatory of
which the urinous reek unselfishly
mingles with the grey and hunger-
disparaging odors from the kitchen.
Here, to the behind-scenes yowling of
transistor Beatles, are manufactured
Japanese mock-ups of spaghetti and
tomato sauce, curry and rice, or gen-
teel isosceles sandwiches, or dim-sims
composed of elements better not
thought about. The food’s one merit
is its thank-God tastelessness. Skilfully
combining Wild West Saloon dash and
oriental finickiness the barman
flourishes a spatula to slice the foam
from the glass jugs of draught beer
the Australians order.
Successive proprietors, and succes-
sions of Japanese customers meekly
and long-time nibbling at the surface
of a pony of beer as though it were
an inordinately pricy and singular
liqueur, have year after year concealed
their contempt for the heavy-drinking
invaders who, every Saturday morning
from eleven o’clock on, crowd into the
Lion with an almost delinquent bra-
vura, louder-mouthed than they are,
twice as Australian as they could ever
be in Australia. Fog or shine, a flannel
sky tenderly vomiting down grouts of
soiled January snow, August giving its
imitation of a sauna bath, Plum Rain
weather or suicide month, the Bar-
barians from Without come roaring
in public-relations men, backroom
boys from the Australian and New
Zealand Embassies, ABC employees,
foreign correspondents, traders’ agents,
tourists who have heard of the Lion
on the grapevine, and members of that
clan of confidence-men and near-con-
fidence-men who are the flower of Aus-
tralian haut cynicisme. They come,
particularly the dyed - in - the - wool
expatriates enmeshed throughout the
week in webs of native dissimulation
and duplicity, to re-enact themselves
among their kind, to refresh their
evaluations, to exchange home truths
in the cryptic patois, at one and the
same time profane and subtle, self-
mocking and sensitive, brutal arid com-
passionate, merciless and stingless, that
only Australian men can use and
understand.
Although the Shimbashi immediately
surrounding the Lion presents to the
polluted upper air of Tokyo its archi-
tectural crosswords of plate-glass and
ferro-concrete, its vulgar rooftop fair-
grounds and beer gardens, its rooftop
golf-driving and baseball-pitching
centres encaged in green nylon netting,
down below, level with the Lion, near
the fissured and buckled footpaths
silkily gleaming with spittle, are the
pinball parlors, noodle stalls, flop-
houses, homosexual bars, and the hole-
in-the-wall haunts of herbalists, astrolo-
gers, palmists, face-readers, acupuncture
quacks, cut-rate abortionists, and third-
rate cosmetic surgeons, all jammed
together behind booths displaying vege-
tables and ex-vegetables, azure plastic
buckets, and mechanical toys in the
shape of prehistoric monsters called
Gappa or Godzilla or Gommola. In
the mean square which separates the
Lion frorri Shimbashi railway station one
step over rows of rumpen, no-hopers,.
vagabonds, prone and sodden with their
ferocious tipple of shochu, the grappa-
like dregs of rice wine. They and their
prophet’s wild manes, their gnarled feet
and lice-populated beards are wrapped
in tatters of straw matting like parcels
of stale meat. The whole area is
squalid, stinking, respectably vicious,,
and unremittingly raucous.
Across a lane from the Lion, tucked,
like a never-emptied commode beneath
a bed, under the Dickensian arches of
the overhead railway, its foundations
vibrating in the roof of the subway,
is the dive .New Yorker, an ear-splitting
inferno of jrike-boxes, red lighting, and
rough-as-bags hostesses, earthy crea-
tures from the dwindling rural hinter-
land, who have scented, painted, and
adorned themselves as aphrodisically
as the law . allows in cheong-sams of
conjunctivitis-inducing crimsons and
verdigris-greens and bale-loader oranges
split to their peasant buttocks. Hefty
Hokusai hussies all, as well as
Hogarthian whores, their laughter is
so shrill as to have almost another
hideous color of its .own. After a
matriculatory grog session at the Lion
there I am, in the New Yorker, sitting
numbly as a haunch of venison on a
banquette of bum-worm magenta plush


at a table awash with spilt ale, and
double repulsive with the spiny rubble
of a Japanese meal. I am not alone.
Opposite is Blue. The others have, one
by one, like the ten little nigger boys,
lurched off “Hooroo!” “Seeya,
mate!” “Hooroo!” “Seeya, mate!”
Blue and I are the last two of the
Mohicans. Of the two I, at least, am
incontestably shicker, at the stage
where the slightest gesture, the mildest
slip of the tongue, or the sliver of a
side-glance from a repulsive stranger
seems fraught with significance. One
drink more, one only, and the garish
curtain of hullabaloo will lift to reveal
the mountain of white gold and
precious silence exploding slow-motion
upwards to the knees of God. I am
perfectly capable, I feel, of the look-
no-hands! feat of singing in Icelandic,
rattling off the Koran, understanding
what moths gently semaphore with
their powdered antennae. It is not to
be. Blue, with an extra glaze on his
eyes that makes me think of farm-
house axe-murderers, says in his dese-
crating voice, “You don’ remember me,
y’ bastard.”
Oh dear, oh dear, dear, dear.
Having indubitably waited to say it,
he says it flatly, flatly just this side of
hurt vanity, flatly just this s>de of a
perceptible necessity for bitterness. I
am airborne enough to get this, but
neither sozzled enough nor sober
enough to do a passata sotto by some-
thing like, “Are you sure, mate?” or
“Watch it, watch it!” Instead, I sit
mute as mud, and this silence reveals
all. No, it states, I don’t remember you.
Icelandic, Kalmuk elegies, and a fra-
ternal understanding of what lies be-
hind the caprices of alligators may, at
the moment, be well within my scope.
Re Blue, alas and alack, my receiver
is off the hook.
He perceives this. It is not not not
to be borne. Dead certain, Blue is,
that he is not really invisible, right
now, and also never was in lost-to-me
then, some yesterday, some foundered
year. With a sudden shocking violence
he uses his execrable voice and un-
matching gestures to have the morass
cleared from the table by one suety
trollop, fresh beer brought by another.
Then, his eyes mesmeric, he settles
down to the self-resurrecting stint of
putting me s-t-r-a-i-g-h-t. As his own
apostle he is pretty vivid, and not to
be side-tracked. The trains above the
roof, the trains under the floor, the
killer traffic outside the bead curtain,
the delirious juke-boxes and god-
damning Yankee matelots inside, none
of this means a thing, could be silence.
He lowers his voice as if just to show.
He hangs on his every word. I, too,
hang, fighting down an impulse to fold
my. hands on the table between us like
a good little kindergartener. Patiently,
truculently patiently, he lifts stone after
stone from my memory and, my God,
suddenly, presto, lo and bloody behold,
abracadabra, the crocuses spike
through, spire up, unfurl, and, in the
pandemonium and fetid volcano-red
gloom of the New Yorker, part of a
past unhibernates. A reconstituted he
and I are eighteen years younger. The
scene is Kure, Occupation Japan. He
is a corporal wooing the oh-so-sw'eet-
and-cute housegirl of a Seventh Day
Adventist major in the Officers’ Mess
I also live in.
I seemed, in those days, to be always
bumping into him. There he was, any
five-thirty, waiting for thp major’s
housegirl by the sentry-box at the
Mess gate, meantime, not wasting time
by third-degreeing or selling short the
giggling and cross-eyed guard. There
he was, as invariably as though the
fates had spun some pretty plot to
cross-pollinate us, in whichever of the
beer-kiosks, or trinket-shops, or tea-
houses I had arbitrarily chosen to give
my custom to. There he was in the
pathetic two-room brothel behind the
White Rose Souvenir Shoppe, where
the drinking of luke-warm Asahi beer
and the relief of lust took place on the
threadbare matting of a room furnished
with a pre-Raphaelite sewing machine,
a cheval glass sheathed in frayed
brocade, and an elaborate Buddhist
altar of mildewed gilt in a lacquer
cabinet that also contained two bottles,
one of Suntory whisky, the other of a
murky purgative. Cut-out magazine
photographs of Betty Grable and Moira
Shearer were pinned to the walls. The
room was often aesthetically misted by
the fumes, very Art Photograph, of
smouldering mosquito repellant.
Stenches of varying felicity corkscrewed
their tentacles through rents in the
paper shutters from God-knows-what
putrescence or cess-pit out there in a
tatterdemalion town slapped together
from the charred boards and singed
tiles of wartime bombings.
Blue had, then, an unfailing cheeky
savoir-faire which was engaging, but so
intense that it made my mind behave
like a merry-go-round it was impossible
to descend from. His quips and cranks
were machine-gun but not fresh, not
fresh. Whenever we parted after one
of these apparently predestined hook-
ups he was unable to stop himself
squalling out not only “Au reservoir,
amigo!” but also, never a miss, “Auf
wienerschnitzel, chico!” He badgered
me, with the fervor of Mephistopheles,
to come in on his Black Market beat:
my blunt refusals seem to him crass,
my lack of enthusiasm scandalous, if
not perverted. He drolled romantically
about his house-girl in the goody-goody-
tones of a Sir Lancelot, his hot little
hand meantime virtually well up the
kimono skirt of one or other of the
three spaniel-eyed White Rose harlots.
Although our natures were, by and
large, absolutely opposite, recurring
encounters, destiny-engineered or not,
led us to exchange little snippets of
unwanted truth about ourselves. None
was important, and I have a hazy
impression that we were drifting apart
out of mutual boredom, when it came
out that we both knew Gippsland well.
Home-town-I-want-to-wander - down -
your-back-streets stuff was on. Our
relationship now had a different
climate and background, both de-
formed. It began to seem that we had
not' only lived in Gippsland but had,
as well, in a terrain without horizon,
outline, language, or name, together
participated in an initiation ceremony
esoteric to the last degree, and
eternally binding. In the oriental chaos
and misery and speeded-up corruption
of the time it was sufficient for us to
recite the names of Gippsland places
Rosedale, Bunyip, the Haunted
Hills, Herne’s Oak to make us feel
we were members of the one tribe. In
Mr. Hal Porter, who was a teacher to children
of the Occupation Forces in Japan, recently revisited
the country. This short story, with others projected,
is a result of his second visit. A book on the same
subject, “The Actors, an Image of the New Japan,”
with drawings by the author, will be published by
Angus and Robertson in the spring.
a way, of course, we were. Our senses
had been similarly baptised, and the
shared memory of beige summer pad-
docks speckled with raisins of sheep
dung, of regiments of ringbdrked
eucalypts St.-Vitus-dancing in the heat-
ripples, of ravens carping and cursing
as they probed the sun-split acres for
crickets, of Princes Highway telegraph
wires shrilling in Antarctic winds that
smell of brine and seals and lost floes,
provided us with enough tribal
counters and nostalgic cards to play a
childish and empty-headed game of
Strip-Jack-Naked neither of us won,
In short, in the tawdry gehenna of
the New Yorker, he recalls us as we
are tipsily deceiving ourselves into
thinking we were. Likg a belligerent
warlock he conjures up the ghosts of
our younger ghosts. The dusk of
drunkenness deepens. It is nevertheless
meteorite-clear that what happened in
Kure is happening again. That year, it
was a common Gippsland past which
decorated our cut-and-come-again
relationship. Now, it is to be the
common past of Occupation Kure that
is to handcuff us together again. Since


Tactical Missiles: A report from General Dynamics
Evening the odds against
surprise attack:
Even for those who weren’t there, news-
reels of World War II and the Korean
War have made this scene familiar:
Troops are moving along a road or
field. Suddenly, an enemy plane swoops
out of the sky with machine guns and
cannons blazing. Troops scatter for
cover. A few fire at the disappearing
plane —but in vain.
Today, the foot soldier does not have
to head for cover. He has an equalizer.
Now the scene would go like this:
An enemy plane is seen in the dis-
tance. An infantryman shoulders a wea-
pon that resembles a bazooka. Through
an eyepiece he sights the plane, squeezes
a trigger and a missile whooshes out of
the tube. Seconds later, the plane ex-
plodes.
Such a weapon is now moving into
the hands of field troops. It is made by
General Dynamics and called Redeye.
It is a tactical guided missile designed
to be used by one man.
The bullet that gets
a second chance:
A bullet or shell is affected by gravity
and wind, but, by and large, once fired
it continues in the direction it was orig-
inally pointed.
A sharp eye, a steady arm and an ac-
curate gun are all you need to hit a
stationary target.
A moving object has to be “led”—the
gunner judges where the moving object
will be in a few fractions of a second
and points his bullet there.
But to “lead” an airplane traveling at
the speed of sound, miles high and able
to change its direction in a hurry, you
need a guided missile.
An effective surface-to-air weapon
must be capable of fast reaction. Its
warhead must be powerful enough to
destroy an attacking plane. Its speed
and range must be enough to reach the
attacking aircraft before the plane’s
offensive weapons can be launched
against ground troops.
But the real key is in the word guided.
The guided missile, like its evasive
target, can be steered and sometimes
steer itself. In fact, you might call a tac-
tical guided missile a “bullet that gets a
second chance.”
Let's take a look at three produced
by General Dynamics—Terrier, Tartar
as well as Redeye— to see how some tac-
tical missiles work. All are essentially
defensive weapons.
Terrier and Tartar are supersonic,
solid-fueled missiles used by the United
States Navy. Both have what is known
as “semi-active homing” guidance. This
involves a complex of shipboard radar
and computers, combined with sensing,
computing and controlling devices with-
in the missile itself.
When search radar aboard a ship
finds an oncoming target, a radar illu-
mination beam, controlled through a
central computer, seeks out the attack-
ing plane. The radar waves reflected
from the airplane are picked up by a
sensor in the nose of the missile, which
will chase its target to intercept even if
the plane changes course several times.
Terrier:
Terrier is the bigger of the two. On its
launcher aboard a Navy cruiser, it is
about 27 feet long. The first 15 feet are
the missile proper. The second 1,2 con-
tain a booster rocket for propulsion.
Terrier is always ready to go. Almost
within,the instant that the illumination
beam fastens on the approaching air-
craft, Terrier is triggered.
The booster blasts the missile off the
launching rack. The finder is already
receiving the reflected beam from the
target. Two small charges within the
missile have already ignited. Their burn-
ing gases turn two small turbines. One
provides power for the guidance and
control systems. The other operates a
hydraulic pump whose fluids move the
small guidance fins on the missile’s tail.
As the booster burns out and then
drops away, a sustainer rocket within
the missile proper commences firing to
continue necessary velocity to intercept.
Tartar:
Tartar is similar to Terrier, but more
compact (15 feet long and about 1,200
pounds compared to 27 feet and about
3,000 pounds for Terrier).
Its booster and sustainer are com-
bined into a single-rocket engine. When
Above: Cruiser fires a Terrier. Right: Diagram shows radar
waves sent from a ship and reflected from a plane being re-
ceived by seasor in nose of the missile. Even if the plane takes
evasive action, the missile will change course to intercept.

1. An infantryman (above) fires a Red-
eye missile at a target drone airplane.
2. This is an actual photo of a Redeye missile (arrow) entering the jet exhaust of a
drone airplane. Immediately after this photograph was taken, the plane exploded.
Tartar gets its signal, the engine gener-
ates high initial thrust to shoot aloft,
then reduces its force to provide the
long sustained velocity to reach and
chase a distant target.
Both Terrier and Tartar, in spite of
their size, can be fired repetitively al-
most as fast as a bolt-operated rifle.
Diagram shows how missile changes
course as the target changes course.
Stored in automated magazines, they
can be lifted onto a launcher, hooked
into the central computer radar control
and fired within seconds.
Ships equipped with Terrier or Tartar
can defend themselves against an armada
of attacking aircraft today far more ef-
Tartar (15 feet)
fectively than would have been possible
against a single aircraft ten years ago.
Redeye:
Redeye is designed to destroy low-flying
aircraft rather than high-altitude super-
sonic attackers. Four feet long and three
inches in diameter, it weighs only 28
pounds complete with its launcher.
Redeye’s heat-seeking guidance is
wholly self-contained. Reaction time is
little more than it takes the soldier to
lift the launcher to his shoulder, find the
attacking aircraft in the sighting scope
and squeeze the trigger. By that time,
Redeye’s infrared sensor has locked
onto the source of heat it must follow.
A small charge projects the missile
from its launching tube. At a distance
far enough to protect the soldier from
rocket blast, a fuse lights the major
rocket charge. Miniature computer cir-
cuitry within the missile directs a set of
Redeye launcher
Redeye missile (4 feet)
steering fins which enable Redeye to
change direction as necessary and chase
the target at supersonic speed until it
intercepts it.
During the long history of combat,
the advantage of surprise has almost
invariably lain with the attacker. The"
modern tactical missile now more than
evens the odds for the defender. At Gen-
eral Dynamics we are already develop-
ing newer ones with still more punch.
General Dynamics is a company of sci-
entists, engineers and skilled workers
whose interests cover every major field of
technology, and who produce: aircraft;
marine, space and missile systems; tac-
tical support equipment; nuclear, elec-
tronic and communication systems; ma-
chinery; building supplies; coal, gases.


a conclusion must be drawn from the
increasingly domestic quality of our
tosspot exchanges at the New Yorker,
it is as sure as nightfall that the
relationship is to continue. Indeed,
when I wake the next morning with a
mouth that has the taste and texture
of tinfoil, and start to put into order
the jigsaw of now-blurred, now-blind-
ing bits cumbering my hangover, it is
obvious that the relationship has
already begun to continue. His business
card is in my wallet. Written on its
back are the time and place of a tryst.
The proper side of the card indicates
that he is a sales representative for
a variety of commodities: Canadian
margarine and tinned milk, New Zea-
land frozen lamb, Japanese beef and
plastic vessels, an English gin, an Eng-
lish rum, American sporting equip-
ment, Australian pineapple juice. His
honest-to-God name? Gregory R.
Patience. R? Ronald? Ralph? Roger?
Reginald? Richard? It no longer mat-
ters.
Even his nickname, although I con-
tinue to use it to him, is not what my
mind uses because, after we leave the
New Yorker, I discover that he is Mr.
Butterfry, the foul-mouthed, uncouth,
embittered, loathed Mr. Butterfry.
I do not remember leaving the New
Yorker, but do remember feeling Anzac-
tall and commando-masculine as we
buffet our way along beneath the barrel-
sized lanterns and sickly stripling wil-
lows of the narrow Shimbashi streets,
through gaggles of squat and unripe
boulrvardiers with louts’ jaws, and eye-
brows like moustaches, who are pick-
ing their delicate way, puma-like, in
cruelly pointed non-leather shoes,
among the pools of footpath water
which blaze and jerk about with the
violet and saffron and venom-green and
raspberry of reflected and ever-stutter-
ing neons.
I remember a solitary geisha, out-
side the Shimbashi Registry Office for
Geisha, entering the leatherette door of
a jinricksha, and being sealed in like
a fabulous idol behind its little isin-
glass window by her two-legged horse.
She is herself already sealed in layer
upon layer of opalescent kimono,
bound about by a sash stiff with metal-
lic threads. Swaddled, girdled, con-
stricted in her almost hieratic attire, her
ludicrous burden of a wig flashing like
a huge orchid of black glass, her face
and hands thickly frosted with white
paint, her. vermilion lips and jet eye-
brows glistening like wet enamel, she is
borne off by the man-horse, upright as
a clockwork effigy, anachronistic, im-
moral, elegant and artificial, exquisitely
grotesque.
I remember swaggering after my
guide into a number of smallish night-
places alive with hostesses of a coquet-
tishness so defined as to be nearly bel-
licose albeit nauseatingly saccharine,
each ready to mulct any man for every
yen he has. Since each drink makes me
seem taller to myself, each new batch
of harpies in sequins seems shorter,
more and more like plucked monkeys
in make-up and drag. Any moment, oh
any moment, they will one and all
scamper up the posts of the live combo
platform, or up the fluted pillars of
the bar-counter, take to the rafters,
and swing indolently there by spangled
milk-white tails among the fake maple
leaves and Gifu lanterns depending
from the ceiling. I remember with a
faultless and absolute clarity that, in
night-spot after night-spot, it is these
simian women with the raw-fish hali-
tosis of seagulls who, baring their teeth
in smiles so deliberately brilliant that
one senses they abhor him, call my
companion Mr. Butterfry.
I step aside to make comment. Most
Japanese find it vexing and difficult to
distinguish between 1 and r sounds. In
their mouths Mr. Butterfly becomes
Mr. Butterfry, a term of particularly
incalculable insult when pronounced,
with howsoever incandescent a smile,
by bar hostesses. Spoken behind the
back the expression is contemptuous
enough. Spoken to the face it is an
appalling insult, saturated with malice.
Its open use suggests that whatever
incited the use has been priced as
seriously appalling, also. Unforgivable
loss of face has been caused. Only one
step away is the offer of the arsenic-
spiced gateau, the jug of petrol thrown
in the face, and then ignited. From
women as low in the social scale as
bar hostesses any insult is trebled in
value. Nearly all hostesses are essen-
tially prostitutes in that they accept
money for sexually satisfying men.
This is not how they see themselves.
Because they reserve the right to refuse
a man, however rarely, and even if
never, they view themselves as non-
prostitutes prostitutes are women
without a nay. That this snobbish hal-
lucination of superiority is no more
than a distinction without a difference
would never enter their heads.
Hostesses are, however, not only on
the lookout for a well-heeled male as
husband, love-nest sugar daddy, or one-
night stand. As hostesses, as cigarette-
lighting animals, drink-orderers, table-
companions, hand-holders, and ego-
boosters, their presence is heavily
charged for by the hour. As well they
get a percentage on every drink drunk
in their company, on every dish of
salted peanuts, celery curls, dehydrated
sardines, or seaweed-infested biscuits
they can wheedle on to a customer’s
table. They prefer, therefore and natur-
ally, regular clients, feckless clients,
mug clients, who will dally for hours
nibbling and sipping and tipping, and
who, when the inflated bill is' presented
at the evening’s end, will pay it without
question. Noblesse oblige! Face must
not be lost!
Mr. Butterfry has only a drink or
two in each clip-joint. Why not? We
are ladder-drinking, pub-crawling. He
is showing me the many bars he is
familiar with, the same many bars
in which he is loathed. He is not
loathed affectionately or offhandedly.
Just inside every satin-quilted or rusti-
cally bamboo or abstract-adorned bar-
restaurant door fie is met with simon
pure loathing, naked hatred. There is
no mistaking, though sloshed I am,
what the deadly eyes display above the
switched-on smiles. I arrive at the
idea that he is execrated not only be-
cause he rebuffs, in tonally offensive
Japanese, any attempt to clip him,
not only because he scorns the rules
of the game to pay as he goes, and
pocket the change. It is rather elsewise
the vehemence of his manner, the
malevolence of his unnecessary candor.
It is his own hatred. It smells of
murder. With no idea of what he is
saying, I can hear that his voice
brandishes knives, and flourishes vit-
riol. When we leave, the Japanese
rules of duplicity require that we are
farewelled with a facsimile of politeness
(anyway, / am doing nothing out-
rageous), with bows that must be hell
to make, with cooings that must scald
the larynx.
‘‘Auf wienerschnitzel, y’ bandy
bitches!” shouts bandy Mr. Butterfry
and, on the way to the next duel of
hatreds, bedecks the theme of Bloody
Jap Women are the Bloody Scum of
the Earth with “Pox-ridden bloody
sluts! Bloody blood-sucking jealous
bloody tarts, everyone of ’m! ’N r
they’ve all got false bloody tits! Bloody
gold-diggers!” and worse, far worse,
cn and on, until the last bar shuts,
and another Saturday disappears down
the sewer dealing with days that have
no history.
Where, meantime, is the vivaciously
boring Blue who waited by the sentry-
box with a presento of chocolate bis-
cuits and Black Market stockings?
Where is the Blue who punned abom-
inably, and unceasingly chattered (and
acutely chaffered), in the back room
of the White Rose Souvenir Shoppe?
My hangover still surrounding me
in the fashion of a saint’s nimbus, I
keep the business-card tryst, and dis-
cover from a Mr. Butterfry far less
injured than I that there should be
an overnight bag with me because it
was arranged in the New Yorker that I
am coming on a commercial-traveller
foray into the country. Not daring to
reveal that I have no memory of this,
I lie that all I need is a toothbrush,
which I shall buy at the chemist’s in
the underground town at Shinjuku,
where I also propose having a
draught of bottled oxygen to vaporise
away my nimbus, which is steadily
turning dog-colored. Presently, nim-
bus-free, I and a toothbrush with a
mauve handle enter Mr. Butterfry’s
Nissan Gloria, and we take off on the
first of the many meaningless, fascin-
ating, and revelatory trips we are to
make together.
“Y’ little mate” is how the Lion

The consequences of peace
DESPITE THE Marxist view of how
capitalism needs wars, there is no need
to fear the effects that peace in Viet-
nam would have on the Australian
economy. True, prices of some mineral
exports could suffer temporary falls.
But even this may be open to doubt
because an absence of peace could also
mean weak market prices, since a con-
tinuation of the expensive Vietnam War
could bring such restraints on world
trade, anyway (as a result of pressure
on the dollar), that commercial con-
sumers of these minerals may well be
required to contract their demand.
For instance, it would be far worse
for the lead and zinc exporters if the
U.S. motor industry were so savaged
by domestic restraints and higher taxes
because of Vietnam that its production
(and therefore demand for metals that
went into them) was slashed. The
beach-sand miners would be far more
enthusiastic about a healthy American
economy which could afford rapid tech-
nological advance into further uses of
titanium, as in commercial airliners or
space-age equipment, than about a high
level of demand that existed only for
warplanes for Vietnam.
In any event, the world’s stock
markets are taking the view that peace
would do world trade a power of good
despite the clear disadvantages some
countries, like Japan for instance, would
suffer as a result of reduced U.S. war-
procurement spending. But the
Japanese think (as reflected in the
huge rise in the Tokyo stock market
following President Johnson’s peace
moves) that the threat to world trade
and the stability of the dollar repre-|
sented in a continuation of the Viet-'
nam War is far greater than the risk
of losing a few war contracts. The same
goes here.
Oil
Bigger and better
THERE IS now no doubt at all that
BHP is sitting on a much bigger oilfield
in Bass Strait than its partner, Esso, has
yet revealed. But it won’t be long before
the facts of just how much staggeringly
bigger will be released. On May 1, the
Premier of Victoria, Sir Henry Bolte,
is to make a statement that may signal
the end of Australia’s role as an oil
importer and herald in the age of oil
as an earner of export income.
At the moment, the Esso-BHP part-
nership is working on a submission to
the Government on its plans for
development of the oilfields in Bass
Strait, stating such things as the num-
ber of production wells proposed, the
extent of the reserves (as they now
appear), and the rate of production
likely. This is to be finished by the end
of this month. But as Esso’s J. FI.
Hamlin said this week: “There is a
great deal of exploration yet to be done,
but by the end of this month we would
be prepared to be definitive about our
estimates.”
When Esso last month upgraded the
expected proportion of Australia’s oil
needs that Bass Strait would provide
from 30 percent to 60 percent, it
avoided stating its new estimates of
reserves. But last weekend, the “Econo-
mist” in London printed a startling
new estimate of 1000 million barrels,
or four times earlier expectations. Said
Mr. Flamlin this week: “It would be
premature for me to confirm or deny
this article.”
The “Economist” said that the lowest
guess is that oil reserves at Bass Strait
probably amount to 1000 million
barrels the equivalent of SA.3 billion
or $U.5.3.6 billion against the esti-
mate of only about 250 million barrels.
Aluminium
A need for price guidelines?
WHICH HAND of Alcoa (the Alu-
minium Company of America) stands
to benefit most from the latest remark-
able deal the company has pulled off;
its Australian subsidiary (51 percent
owned) or its Japanese associate (one-
third owned)? There are a lot of
questions that need to be answered
about this deal that will on the one
hand increase the economics of Alcoa’s
Australian operation but which will at
the same time give the Japanese one a
large volume of aluminium ingot at
what it describes as “cost.” It could
be, of course, that both will benefit; in
that case there should be no hesitation
in the company providing details of the
price its Japanese hand is to pay its
Australian hand. Unfortunately, there
has been hesitation; no price has yet
been revealed.
This deal (in which Alcoa of Aus-
tralia is to provide the Japanese Furu-
kawa Company with 20,000 tons build-
ing up to 30,000 tons of ingot a year)
is one that suggests the need for an
official price guidelines as used to
obtain in the iron-ore industry. For
the Japanese are to take all but 20,000
tons of the extra capacity that is to
follow from the doubling of the Point
Henry aluminium smelter at a cost
based on a buying price for alumina
from the Kwinana refinery plus an un-
stated “toll” charge for smelting it at
Point Henry.
When this proposition first was sug-
gested some months ago, The Bulletin
was under the impression that the
Japanese would get a good price on
their aluminium because they would
be contributing to the $U.5.46 mil-
lion loan needed to double the Point
Henry smelter’s capacity to 90,000 tons

(as well as to expand the Kwinana
refinery and complete the brown coal
power station the company needs at
Anglesea). But now this loan is to be
provided by a consortium of European
banks in Eurodollars; the Japanese are
not having to put in a cracker by the
look of it, but are going to get the
benefits of that expansion in cheaper
aluminium all the same.
It is also striking that a large part
of the remaining 20,000 tons of the
planned expansion at Point Henry is
destined for the local market despite
the complaints by rival local semi-
fabricator (and potential smelter)
Alcan last week that there was excess
capacity in the industry already. This
is evident from the fact that at present
Alcoa exports about one third of its
metal production and that the local
aluminium market has grown at only
about five percent to 78,000 tons of
metal last year compared with a market
growth of 11 percent a year for the
previous five years. To meet this
demand, Comalco already has capacity
for 72,000 tons, Alcoa can now produce
40,000 tons (which will rise to 90,000
tons in 1971), and Alcan will be able to
add a further 40,000 tons by next year.
So without any further additions,
Australian producers could be capable
of 'making about 208,000 tons of alu-
minium ingot by the early 1970 s to
meet a local demand that is not ex-
pected to reach 175,000 tons until
1975. It is clear that export markets
are going to be vitally important, par-
ticularly if Comalco’s New Zealand
project (using Gladstone alumina from
bauxite, and in conjunction with
another group of Japanese companies)
eventually gets off the ground.
On top of this, of course, is the still-
awaited news of the Gove project,
"where Swiss Aluminiu'm and an Austra-
lian consortium headed by CSR are due
to come up with a scheme that should
eventually have provision for a local
refinery, and possibly a smelter.
Nevertheless, it would be churlish
not to recognise that Alcoa has done a
remarkable job in Australia.
Its brief seven years or so experience
in this part of the world has been
roses, roses all the way. Look at the
record. In 1961, after Western Mining’s
burghers went cap in hand to Pittsburg
to seek Alcoa’s participation in an alu-
minium development, it sewed up, with
only a minority thread of participation,
massive bauxite reserves in W.A. Within
the year it was busy at Point Henry and
Kwinana putting the necessary plants
in position to get the full-range bauxite,
alumina, and aluminium metal to play
with. Within another year it was setting
the pace in price reductions to get a
foot in the Australian market for the
metal, then dominated by Comalco. By
an astute marketing assault it got hold
of a sufficient share gradually to war-
rant getting its full smelting capacity
into full production, and without much
of a word to anybody its local surpluses
of metal, bauxite, and alumina were
finding outlets overseas through its net-
work of trade links and affiliates. It
feigned some concern before the Tariff
Board aluminium inquiry in 1965 at
the growing competition in marketing
and the prospects of overcapacity in
smelting, seeking preferment for its
place in the smelting sun under the
guise of being rather more Australian-
owned than its competitors.
All this was followed by new expan-
sion on its own part, first at Kwinana,
where the original alumina refining
capacity is being quadrupled, and now
at Point Henry, with the main finance
coming from Alcoa of America, which,
as well as its 51 percent equity share,
has already put $lOO million or so loan
money up for the venture, but from
the Eurodollar market ($46 million
of it).
Bass Strait oil
A public scandal
THE SIMPLE fact is that Esso should
not have been allowed to borrow the
$3O million it is soon to soak up from
the Australian public. It is a public
scandal that a company which has
shown no inclination whatsoever to give
Australians an equity position in its
50 percent stake in the Bass Strait oil
project should be able to raise even a
proportion of the loan funds it requires
from the local market. It is nonsense
to talk of this issue (at rates yet to
be announced) as simply a funding
operation of the short-term debt that
Esso has already raised in the money
markets; there is nothing to stop the
company raising more short-term cash
this way once the $3O million has been
dragged out of Australian purses at a
fixed rate of return only to gear-up the
profit rate on the relatively small
amounts of its own capital that Esso
will have involved in the project.
If it is good enough to raise Aus-
tralian money at fixed interest rates (no
matter how generous and we have
yet to see what they are) it is good
enough to give Australians an equity
share in the profits from Esso’s Bass
Strait wells. And as for the sophisti-
cated nonsense employed to defend Esso
in pointing out that Australians are
already getting a stake in Bass Strait
through BHP, the fact is that the BHP
half is a separate half altogether.
Nothing that BHP does has anything
to do with what Esso does. And as for
the protestations by Esso deputy chair-
man J. H. Hamlin that the issue, the
biggest ever by an overseas-owned com-
pany in Australia, is “not necessarily
connected with the U.S. balance of
payments problem,” the evidence sug-
gests that this is nonsense. Esso is part
of the world’s biggest oil company
(Standard Oil of New Jersey) and bor-
rowing rates are still cheaper in the
U.S. than they are here. This is exactly
the sort of deal that should be pro-
hibited without some undertakings
about local equity participation. This
is really selling out.


BRIEFLY

exceeded for the first time with investors making enthusiastic
response to American peace initiatives. The London financial

MEN AND MATTERS
MAYBE THE toughly competitive Aus-
tralian paint industry breeds colorful
and successful businessmen; anyway,
this month the world-wide U.K.-based
Berger, Jensen and Nicholson paint
group has Australia making up almost
half its board of directors. The three
Australians in its seven-man board-
room are the group’s managing director,
A. J. (Bill) Hughes, its former boss and
now top man of the International Wool
Secretariat, W. J. (Bill) Vines, and,
following his appointment a fortnight
ago, the present managing director of
the Australian Berger subsidiary, C. J.
(Clarrie) Callaby a threesome that
■once sat together on the local company’s
board. *
Bill Vines has maintained his Berger
links since he moved, in 1961, from the
number one position with Berger in
London into a newly created post of
■“Mr. Wool” - managing director of
the IWS. His childhood on sheep pro-
perties, work for a woolbroking firm,
an accountancy degree, war service with
the ninth division in the Middle East
and the Pacific, Vice-Presidency of
Melbourne Legacy, six years with the
Berger business in Australia, and six
years as managing director of the world
company fitted him for one of the most
exacting positions in world commerce,
responsible to the IWS for operations
in 17 countries.
Now 52, his capacity for sleeping in
planes and exercising at airports would
have helped him to endure extensions
of his original five-year appointment.
■ His post with Berger was taken by
Bill Hughes, now 54, who was origin-
ally one of Sir John Storey’s bright
boys. After a science course at Leeds
University, navy service in a destroyer
during the war, a term with Overseas
Corporation, he became N.S.W. general
manager for Berger in 1951. Three
years later he moved to the managing
directorship of Supertex, but returned
to the Berger fold as managing director
in 1958.
Hughes is the marketing expert who
pulled Bergers out of its postwar slump
when two of the big four that supply
80 percent of the local market, Bergers
and Balm, stuck to lead paints for
exteriors, while Taubmans and British
Paints moved into titanium gloss paints,
and when Bergers hung on too long to
flat oil paints for interiors instead of
swinging to plastic paints, which were
introduced by the little companies. Bill
Hughes launched Berger Breeze to
make a spectacular recovery for the
company. His province was the decora-
tive paints side, where Australia, offer-
Bill Vines
C. J. Callaby
ing twice as many colors as British
producers, has the most aggressive mar-
ket in the world.
Clarrie Callaby, now 57, joined the
Australian company 42 years ago. With
an industrial chemistry background-
(Sydney Tech) he is the true working
director. His initial board appointment
17 years ago was with the responsibility
for production and supply. When he
became deputy managing director to
Mr. Hughes in 1964, he was made re-
sponsible for the industrial and auto-
motive paint sales.
The trio’s common outside interest
is gardening and golf; Bill Hughes has-
been known to hit a 330 yards drive
only 15 feet off line.


THE
CROESUS
TOUCH
Putting, export
prospects
in perspective
BY J. C. HORSFALL
AN ASSESSMENT of the contribution
recent minerals discoveries here can
be expected to make to the Australian
economy has to take many factors into
account. Firstly, the massive imports
savings which will accrue from the big
finds of petroleum, phosphate rock,
manganese, and nickel (which with sul-
phur and asbestos were our main min-
erals deficiences. only a year or two
ago); and a lot of other aspects, such as
their assistance to exports, the costs of
servicing the overseas capital in de-
veloping them (not to speak of repay-
ing the overseas loans involved), the lift
they will give to industrial development,
and so on. The net overall kick, by
general consent, will be tremendous. It
is a pity, therefore, that many people
who should know better have been look-
ing primarily at potential export contri-
butions from minerals and rivalling
them with exports of other industries,
such as wool.
Thus it was salutary of Sir William
Gunn, on Tiis return from America,
where he’s been looking over its wool
industry, to nail this narrow view firmly
on the head in a general statement; and,
as if for good measure,' to find Sir
Harold Raggatt in his book “Mountains
of Ore” come up with such weighty evi-
dence in full support- of him. Most
people may not care whether wool or
minerals are at the top of the export
pole so long as both industries do their
level best to increase their exports, and
the wool industry manages to do its
part without having to be supported
with all the Government assistance Sir
William is seeking for it. But it may
be useful to get their export prospects
in perspective.
We don’t know how long Sir William
will be with us, but he is most positive
that “the stage where minerals net in-
come exceeds that of wool” will not be
in his lifetime. The essence of his con-
fidence is that for all its problems and
internal confusion the wool industry
is not being developed by overseas capi-
tal, whereas in the case of minerals the
cost of servicing and repatriating the
massive amounts of overseas capital
being employed in it will long demand
a heavy toll on its gross export returns.
However, if the relative insignificance
of overseas capital in wool cannot be
disputed, neither can the present un-
profitability of the wool industry. Sir
William conceded this, but thinks some-
thing can be done about it; say, by
getting the Government to come to the
party with some form of direct or in-
direct aid; or when woolmen “stop
fighting among themselves” and get
down to resolving their problems.
The exercise of forecasting the
favorite for top export eight years
ahead isn’t a simple one. But assum-
ing, say, that wool contributed no
more nor less than its present $BOO
million a year to exports in 1975, at
least on Sir Harold Raggatt’s examin-
ation of the likely contribution from
minerals to exports in that year, wool
would win hands down, no matter
whether the issue be decided on a
“net” or a “gross” basis. In “Moun-
tains of Ore” Sir Harold estimates that
in 1975 gross export returns from
minerals will be no more than $669
million, in fact only $35 million more
than his estimate for the year 1970.
His estimate for 1975 is made up of
iron ore $217 million, lead, zinc, and
silver $l5O million, black coal $123
million, bauxite, alumina, and alum-
inium $64 million, sand mineral $45
million, copper $25 million, and other
minerals $45 million. It must be recog-
nised, however, that Sir Harold is
very conservative in his estimate. For
instance, even without allowing for
further discoveries, it could well be
that lead, zinc, and silver could be
boosted given the development of the
McArthur River field. Also, copper
could be substantially higher, more
than double, one suggests, given likely
output from Bougainville (CRA) and
substantial increases from other
mines, notably Mt. Isa. Equally, the
aluminium group’s probable contribu-
tion seems understated considering
Alcoa’s big expansion at Kwinana, its
possible increase in smelter capacity
at Port Henry, and the potential
alumina contribution from Gladstone
and Gove (Nabalco-Swiss Aluminium).
Coal seems less understated, but nickel,
which is included in “other,” could be
weighing in much more heavily than
Raggatt allows for and, given a rise
in the price of gold, exports of that
metal, also in the “other” group, could
rise significantly. In fact, Raggatt
allows for an increase of only $lO
million in his “other” group between
1970 and 1975. This seems to be un-
realistic.
Historical fluctuations in world metal
prices being what they are, Sir Harold
has preferred to be deliberately cau-
tious on prices and markets. He has
also made allowance for a generous
increase in Australian domestic con-
sumption of the various metals from
an estimated total 1975 output which
he expects to be more than $l4OO
million (or just about double that of
1965). On prices and markets he offers a
disarming warning which those fol-
lowing the recent trade relations play
with Japan will appreciate: “One dis-
quietening feature of our developing ex-
port in minerals is that most of the
income expected to be derived from
exports of iron ore, iron pellets, and
coal, and a substantial part of income
from exports of alumina and baux-
ite depends upon sales to Japan. Any
setback to the Japanese economy could
affect all three groups of exports: It
is important, therefore, to seek other
outlets for exports of these com-
modities, and the exporting companies
are well aware of this.”
Perhaps his caution on prices is
even more understandable. For despite
the fact that many long-term con-
tracts at fixed prices iron ore and
bauxite, say have been written, the
horrible truth is that world prices for
most metals are extremely vulnerable
to the world’s armaments position.
Given an outbreak of peace, one would
expect demand for most of them to
contract sharply.
It cannot be assumed, blithely at any
rate, that the world statistical position
of our major metals exports will con-
tinue indefinitely to be as good as it is
at present. But discounting this, and
provided world markets are kind,
prices hold at something like their
present levels, and output here expands
a little more rapidly than Sir Harold
allows for in his estimate for 1975, it is
not so difficult to get the total minerals
exports for that year up to $BOO million.
But that is on a gross basis without
allowing for interest and dividend
flows, or repayment of fixed capital to
overseas lenders.
What of wool exports, which, as Sir
William Gunn explains, have not to
carry much burden of interest, divi-
dends, and capital repatriation, the net
figure, that is, been close to the gross?
How will these be faring in 1975? This
would seem to be a very open question,
but Sir Harold has a go at it, too. He
thinks that its exports will be very
much higher—say, an average of $lOOO
million a year by then—and that the
horizon where wool and minerals ex-
ports will come together, even on a
gross basis, is further on: “In another
decade (or less) after 1975 the value of
minerals exports will probably catch
with the value of wool exports.” All
this, mark you, taking exports of both
industries on a gross basis.
When Sir Harold’s studied and sober
analysis of the future gross export con-
tributions of these two industries is
projected against balance of payments
considerations or even more narrowly,
if you like, considered on a net basis
as proposed by Sir William Gunn, wool’s
high and continuing importance is even
further emphasised. As Sir William says,
there is not nearly as much—but there is
some overseas capital in it to service
and repay as in minerals. The wool in-
dustry is surely going to be needed
ntuch more than a lot of fanatical
minerals supporters would have us be-
lieve.

Will Juanita
stay
in Gear
WHAT Juanita Nielsen considers a pity
is the fact that McDowells want to take
over her favorite store, Mark Foy’s.
Juanita runs the Gear Box the
swingin’ clothes section at Mark Foy’s
Piazza store and w’ould rather “fight
than switch.” She wants to keep the
store the way she thinks it should be—
independent. Along with her Aunt Joan,
Dad (who’s on Foy’s board), and other
kinfolk, all who have sizable chunks
of Foy’s capital, she is putting up a
well-publicised fight to stop the take-
over. But how successful she’ll be and
just how much support she’ll receive
from her blood brothers, aunts, uncles,
and the other assorted families involved
when the chips are down remains to
be seen. Incidentally, Juanita only owns
one share on her own account. It seems
reasonable, however, to assume that
the response of the majority of other
shareholders will have some influence
on the way the family finally swings.
And as the bid is a reasonable one
$2.05 cash for each Foy share, which
were selling for as low as 25 cents last
year, and which have a declared asset
backing of 73 cents less than the offer
price—it still looks as though the bid
has a fair chance of success. On this
basis the shares look a good “spec”
at $1.74. For this reason I bought 200.
If the bid does co'me off there’s a gross
profit in it of $0.31 a share which is a
return on investment of 18 percent.
Although this is not a fortune it’s not
a bad sort of return for the time your
money’s actually out (in this case prob-
ably no more than a few months at the
most). Also, in a case like this there is
always the odd chance that McDowells
might decide to increase their bid or
that another bidder may be attracted
on to the scene.
I’m going to hang on to General
Credit shares for the moment in the
hope that the bid by the Commercial
Bank of Australia will be successful
and that I’ll end up with 67 CBA shares
for my 200 General Credits. If the
bid does come off, CBA’s earning rate
will get quite a lift. The takeover will
increase its paid capital by around 20
percent, whereas consolidation of Gen-
eral Credits entire profit into the CBA’s
1967/68 'figures will boost its earnings
by somwhere round 50 percent. This
means that the Bank’s earning rate will
be far ahead of last year’s 17 percent
and that the current dividend rate of 10
percent will be very well placed for a
revision upwards.
This week, I sold off four stocks:
Allied Mills, because even though I
think it should have a good year the
rest of the market obviously doesn’t and
its price is consistently losing ground;
Concrete Industries, because its short-
term future is clouded with intangibles;
Western Titanium and Jaywoth,
merely because they have both shown
me reasonable profits. If I were not a
trader I would consider the last two
well worth hanging on to, for the med-
ium term. The result of the four sales
was a profit of $134.

MINING • SHARE LIST • BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS
MARKET POINTERS • SECURITY ANALYSIS • COMMODITIES
By JASON
THE MINING and oil market is still
the centre of attraction despite the lack
of any really exciting news in recent
times — 1 apart from BHP, of course.
There have been no new nickel finds;
nothing further on phosphate; no news
of the cliff-hanger on iron ore; no hard
facts about uranium; no oil in three
offshore wells outside Bass Strait. Apart
from The Bulletin’s investigations into
the MKU rare-earths’ situation and
some new company floats there has
not been much happening at all.
So, on the principle that it is best
to buy when times are dull, this could
be a time for bargains' in the mining
market.
This is particularly so now that yes-
terday’s leaders in the mining market
have turned into today’s laggards. And
investors looking for a good place
to put their money could go a long way
Before finding such potentially reward-
ing havens as Western Mining Corpora-
tion and Great Boulder. Both are very
heavy in the market, largely because of
their new issues, with WMC dropping
from a prersplit equivalent of $lO to
current prices around $7.25 and Great
Boulder subsiding from last year’s pre-
issue peak of $14.50 to only $5.40.
But both of them look as if they
have dropped about as far as they can
go; despite what the chartists say about
needing some sign of strength first and
their warnings about resistance levels in
any recovery, the fact remains that
good news from either of them could
set them off again. And even without
good news, they are probably quite
good buys at present. WMC speaks for
itself; the factors that made the stock
worth buying at $lO in some people’s
minds still apply except that the market
has turned the stock into an investment
(with its smelting plans) rather than
a speculation, despite the fact that
there is still immense speculative in-
terest in the volume of ore WMC might
eventually end up with.
The same goes for Great Boulder, on
a lesser scale. The sort of nickel pro-
duction operation it could economically
run from its existing relatively low-
grade deposits has given the stock an
underpinning around the $4 mark, with
the extra $1.40 or so representing the
speculative interest of its continued
developmental work and search for
more deposits. This is not a very dear
price to pay for this speculative search,
as the company at least has a leg-in and
certainly has more promising areas to
look at thoroughly than some of those
rival companies whose “prospects” are
more in the mind than in the earth.
THE TRANSOIL flurry, with all the
talk of uranium in South Australia, has
brought a pretty sharp rise to the stock
that could continue provided the ore
values are up to the market’s expecta-
tions. But the market would be wise
not to disregard the company’s stake
(along with Exoil) in the Amadeus
Basin, where large reserves of oil and
gas have been delineated and where
the question is mainly one of economics.
Its oil stake alone would probably be
worth close to the uranium-inspired
current market price of around 40
cents.
But no matter how interesting the
Amadeus Basin looks, it would be a
brave man who would be prepared to
forecast much of a market premium
on the Southern Pacific Petroleum float
from the Magellan stable. One problem
with interesting floats like this (apart
from the fact that Magellan itself has
just raised a lot of cash through a new
issue) is that the taxation benefits in-
volved in subscribing to it plus the tax
losses obtainable by traders if they
sell below par suggest that it would
not matter too much to traders if the
shares were pretty heavy on the market.
Those subscribers wanting the tax
benefit only may well dump them
pretty early in their listed life.
This being so, it may be as well for
those without big taxation rates (and
therefore able to get less benefit) to
abstain from the issue and buy the
shares in their early days on the
market provided, of course, the
underwriters do not decide to support
the stock through what could be some
early selling pressure. One of the joint
underwriters generally seems to have-
avoided support measures in the past,
as has one of the largest brokers to the
issue.
UNLESS THIESS has got some good
nickel prospect that it has yet to reveal,
The Chartist says:
“WALTONS LTD. now shows promise as a long-term recovery situation. It is an
interesting long-term study of a cyclical issue and only those investors who bought
at the low points in 1960 and recently in 1968 would not be showing a loss. How-
ever, there would have been good profits at times on the intermediate trends. The
selling signal was given on penetration of the 30 percent uptrend about $1.70 early
1964. It would now appear that sufficient buy energy has halted the possibility of
a further decline below the 75c support level. Targets of approximately $l.OO,
$1.20, and $1.75 lie ahead with a more optimistic target of $2.30 for the longer-
term. Resistance levels will play a major part as the upward trend develops. Last
sale price on 4/4/68 —85c.

the chances are that the big British
buyer who has been soaking the shares
up at recent prices as high as $4.95
may lose some money. For its other
operations particularly in coal with
Thiess-Peabody-Mitsui are probably
in themselves not worth much more
than $4 a share for Thiess; the extra
90 cents now ruling seems to be the
price the market is paying for the
company’s prospecting chances.
The drag-line problems that affected
coal production last year appear to have
delayed the company’s arrival at its
potential peak profitability from the
TPM operation, so this year’s result
may not be as good as the market had
hoped. Nevertheless, this is a most inter-
esting stock; any significant withdrawal
from current levels could well bring it
into reasonable buying range.
ANOTHER mutual resources stock
that has already suffered from the mar-
ket’s enthusiastic approach is McDonald
Industries, whose share price of $1.60
earlier this year has been cut to $1.20.
Last week’s failure to pay an interim
dividend has been taken badly by the
market, although it is clear that the
company will pay far more than last
year’s final of four percent. The com-
pany’s main appeal is because of its
25 percent stake in and role as mining
contractor for the Frances Creek iron-
ore project. This contract, covering
delivery of 6,000,000 tons of ore to
Japan over 10 years (God and the
Commonwealth Railways willing), is
not yet showing a profit because it has
not yet come anywhere near the
required rate of 60,000 tons a year, but
it should do so before long, as the
Commonwealth Government is improv-
ing the railway’s carrying capacity. The
Melbourne investment analyst service,
Cowan Investment Survey, estimates
that the Frances Creek operation should
earn McDonald’s at least as much as
the company earns from its other
activities in the building and construc-
tion industry, so the company’s earn-
ing rate could soon exceed 40 percent
on capital. This stock, first recom-
mended here at prices around its 50
cent par value last year, should soon
show signs of improvement.
TECHNICALLY, Australian Consoli-
dated Industries is a dead stock; its
inability to sustain its breakthrough
above the $3 mark is the finger of doom
on the company as far as the chartists
are concerned. But the facts are that
ACI is a far more interesting stock
than it admits itself to be. ACI still
has the aura of bottles about it. But
the glass business is only a proportion
of its current activity, which is becom-
ing increasingly oriented toward the
booming building industry (through its
link with St. Regis in Sisalkraft as well
as in windows), the packaging industry
(through its own efforts and those of
its big American associate), and the
engineering industry (through some
fascinating associations that have been
in the news recently). On top of all

that, ACI has a modest stake in the
Barrow Island oilfield through a big
holding of Ampol Exploration shares.
There is no doubt that the stock
has not been one of the most- dynamic
on the lists; its dull record of the past
eight years, which have seen hardly any
growth in its share price or earnings
per share (although dividends have im-
proved), seems likely to be maintained
in the current year, judging from direc-
tors’ warnings. But at last shareholders
should be on the verge of seeing some
rewards for their patience; next year
should see its new projects come good.
If they don’t, then there should be
some changes at the top.
ACl’s STAKE in Ampol Exploration
is getting better looking all the time;
last week Ampol Petroleum reported
that its two-thirds holding in the ex-
ploration company would be a factor
in providing Ampol with a record
profit for the year, which it needs,
anyway, to keep its earnings up at
any sort of comfortable margin over
the ten percent dividend. Directors have
forecast a “satisfactory increase” over
last year’s $6.6 million profit.
Of course, Ampol has plenty of things
going well for it this year: motor regis-
trations are up, which should bring
a significant increase in retail sales
of motor spirit, so giving added stimulus
to a tough business that has been im-
proved by the withdrawal of Phillips;
its Lytton refinery should contribute
more to profits; and its Ampol Mining
subsidiary, which has a stake in the
Savage River iron-ore project, should
soon begin to benefit, as the first ship-
ment of pellets is due to go to Japan
later this month.
On top of this, Ampol Mining has a
bit of the action in the search for other
mining prospects by Pickands Mather
(the U.S. managing agents for the
Savage River operation) and at present
some copper and nickel prospects are
being investigated.
But oil remains the most interesting
thing about Ampol, with The Bulletin’s
information about the water-injecting
process Wapet is using at Barrow Island
clearly showing that it will not only
increase the rate of recovery of oil but
will also increase the proportion that
can be recovered so dramatically that
the oilfield’s size now seems more like
300 million barrels than earlier esti-
mates of little more than 100 million.
LOOK OUT for so'me improvement in
the island trading companies. As the
Melbourne broking house of A. C.
Goode points out, the rapid growth of
the cash economy in Papua-New
Guinea should result in considerable
increases in per capita income followed
by a rise in demand for retail goods.
Three companies— Burns Philp, W. R.
Carpenter, and Steamships Trading
are responsible for more than 50 per-
cent of the retail and wholesale trade
and have directly benefited from the
increase in demand for goods. They
are also heavily involved in plantations
(which they are expanding) and hotels.
Next week, The Bulletin will look
behind the balance sheet of Stea'mships
Trading, the only member of the three-
some with all its assets invested in the
area and which has reported a sub-
stantial increase in half-yearly profit.
OUR CHARTIST comments further
on Pacific Island Mines: Prices failed
to move above the 61c level with heavy
volume mentioned at the time of the
recommendation and a reaction has
since taken prices back to 43c. Support
is strong about the 40c level and for the
present time the situation is neutral.
Last sale price on 4/4/68 —43c.

appears to be having side effects on
Carlton and United Breweries’ shares.
The Zs have been a damp 'market since
the 17 percent earnings lift for the
latest half year was announced at the
end of March (it was foreshadowed a
couple of months earlier, though, by a
cool blast from the company’s new
style publicity machine). Early in the
year the Zs were up to $3.90, but now
appear to be stuck in the $3.60 to $3.70,
where they yield about 3.6 percent. The
13 percent dividend could be twice
covered going on the earnings progress
so far this year. The improvement has
something to do with the good drinking
weather in Victoria this summer, and
as it remains more "mild than bitter
well into April, the full year’s results
could well read as pleasantly as the
interim’s. However, the group’s pre-
Courage advertising campaign must be
costing a lot of 'money and so must
its mopping up of city hotels (it bought
another one in Elizabeth Street this
week). Moreover, the latest half year’s
profit had to bear the solid extra in-
terest load that’s been incurred as a
result of the $lO million debenture
issue a year ago. In fact, in the face
of all this, the latest profit was much
better than might have been expected.
Needless to say, what with the new
■debenture money flowing around,
liquidity in Bouverie Street is as strong
as ever while co'mpetition from Cour-
age is brewing.
IF AUSTRALIANS have been extra
thirsty this year national beer pro-
duction over the summer months aver-
aged 28.2 million gallons a month,
which beats last year’s by 3| percent
and was easily a record for any ti'me
of the year the froth hasn’t blown
off all that evenly on the profits of the
local maltster twins, Barrett Burston
and Smith Mitchell. Neither of these
two companies has set the market alight
with its latest results, though strangely
enough Barrett Burston, whose per-
formance was the inferior, has been
the better received. This prompts
the thought that, for those who take
beer investments in straight malt, a
switch from these $1 shares (around
$2.20 at which on the 12|- percent
dividend they yield only 5 percent)
into Smith Mitchell’s 50c shares stand-
ing at 91c (with the superior dividend
yield of percent on the 12 percent
dividend) would pay off. As well as
this co’mparison in its favor, not only
does Smith Mitchell have a slightly
higher net assets backing per share but
its earnings cover is much better—
-2.4 times compared with Barrett Bur-
ston’s 1.8 last year.
Referring to the interim profits trend
of the two companies, again, in both
cases, lower tax provisions played a
strong part in their net profit increase
for the half year (and for Barrett Bur-
ston a sharp drop in depreciation). But
Smith Mitchell’s profit rise was far
bigger (actually 24 percent as against
about 4 percent). Smith Mitchell’s good
result enabled it to maintain its 12 per-
cent divided rate despite the increase
from $753,500 to $1,010,243 in its
capital occasioned by the issue of
shares to the UK group Associated
British Maltsters during the year, which
gives the latter a 26 percent interest.
Presumably the infusion of this new
British money betokens an expansionist
outlook, possibly with a Courage flavor
and it should comfortably earn its keep
even if it isn’t doing so already.
Incidentally, Associated British
Maltsters has a continuing option up to
July, 1972, to take up further shares
in Smith Mitchell. This see'ms to pre-
dicate further supplies of cheap finance
for any further expansion. However,
the scope for further expansion would
at present appear limited for while, ad-
mittedly, a lot of inefficient malting
units have been closed down in the
past few years in Australia, the loss to
national malting capacity has been
'minimal, if any, because of the estab-
lishment of new makings in Queens-
land. One of the advantages of Smith
Mitchell’s link with Associated British
Makings is its assistance to the group’s
export sales.

Mining
Gypsum: a modest mineral
IT IS HARDLY surprising that Aus-
tralian Gypsum Industries Ltd. has
never been regarded as anything more
than a manufacturer of building
materials and other plaster products;
gypsum hardly ranks as a very exciting
mineral in the current climate of the
Australian mining industry. Neverthe-
less, the company accounts for almost
all of Australia’s exports of this
mineral, which have been growing at
over ten percent per annum during
the past seven years. In 1966, gypsum
to the value of $l.l million was
exported as against the $426,000 worth
exported in 1959. Local consumption
has grown, too, and altogether Aus-
tralian production of gypsum has been
growing at a rate in excess of seven
percent per annum in the past seven
years. The 1959 figure of 500,000 tons
reached 800,000 tons in 1966.
Most of the gypsum produced in
Australia comes from the mines of
Australian Gypsum Industries and the
Colonial Sugar Refining Co., three-
quarters of the total being mined in
South Australia. Of local consumption
of slightly over 500,000 tons, about a
third is used by cement manufacturers
and the remainder as plaster of paris
for use in building materials such as
fibrous plaster sheets, wallboards, and
acoustic tiles. Only a minor amount is
sold on the open market, but export
sales to New Zealand, the Philippines,
and Malaysia have taken place at
prices around $4.75 per ton f.o.b. Last
year’s production was the highest in the
company’s history, an increase in out-
put being necessary to supply both
higher local demand and, more particu-
larly, to meet higher export sales to
South-East Asia.
For Australian Gypsum Industries,
the future may hold more than its
previous reliance on the local building
industry and export sales. Last year
it joined the ranks of other mineral
developers by harvesting salt from Lake
Mac Donnell in South Australia and
sending a trial tonnage. of 8300 tons
to Japan. Lake Mac Donnell is
adjacent to its deposits of gypsum near
Ceduna in South Australia, and should
negotiations, currently under way, be
successful in bringing continuing busi-
ness, the company will be in a particu-
larly good position. For while the salt
deposit is a natural one, and therefore
relies on weather conditions, etc., like
Norseman Gold’s project at Lake Lefroy
(near Kambalda in Western Australia) 1
it is situated very close to a railway
line and port facilities already exist,,
which are currently being used by the
company for its gypsum operations.
Norseman Gold’s salt venture does not
look like becoming a commercial
proposition unless the Western Aus-
tralian Government Railways grant
substantial freight concessions.
Apart from salt there may be other
developments in store for gypsum
miners, depending on the results of in-
vestigations into the cost and feasibility
of using gypsum to produce sulphur.
Gypsum is hydrated calcium sulphate
and is normally processed by the re-
moval of most of its water content by
heating in order to produce plaster of
paris which is then capable of absorb-
ing water and setting into quite a hard
form. Treatment of the dehydrated sul-
phate with ammonia can produce
ammonium sulphate for use as a fer-
tiliser, while gypsum can also be used
as a source of sulphur dioxide for the
manufacture of sulphuric acid. Australia
is particularly deficient in deposits of
elemental sulphur and the use of higher-

CLEAN vs. SMUT
It is a fact that ten years ago, before the emergence of the great Australian Aff-
luence, people and places really did look cleaner. Today, our beaches, highways, parks
and populace appear to be on the losing end of the battle for .cleanliness. But not
our office buildings. Certainly not office buildings that are cleaned and cared for by
Crothall. They wage a battle against dust, dirt and grime that is never ending. And
they are winning. Crothall people, Crothall materials and the Crothall system of
cleaning is a combination that cannot be beaten. For premium quality cleaning service

cost alternatives, such as pyrites, has be-
come more and more attractive with the
increasing demand and higher price of
imports of elemental sulphur from over-
seas. Should this continue, the tech-
nological processes for extracting the
sulphur content of gypsum would even-
tually become more feasible from a cost
point of view. The process would re-
quire considerable amounts of cheap
fuel and it is for this reason that Cen-
tral Pacific Minerals NL, the new min-
ing exploration company being floated
by Brisbane stockbrokers Lance Jones
and Company and Wilson and Com-
pany, has taken up prospective gypsum
areas in the Northern Territory, close to
the large deposits of natural gas which
have been established by the Magellan
and Exoil groups of oil companies.
These reserves of gas and oil are not
at present worthwhile exploiting because
of the very long pipeline needed to
reach markets at Adelaide (which is to
be serviced by the gas reserves held by
Santos anyway) and the Magellan
group has endeavored to develop local
uses for its fuel deposits by encouraging
mineral exploration in nearby areas.
On its own account it acquired last year
prospecting rights covering six large
blocks in the northern area of the
Amadeus Basin in Central Australia.
Considerable geological and geo-
chemical work has been carried out on
these areas and several intei'esting
prospects have been investigated. Mag-
ellan -is now sponsoring the formation
of Central Pacific Minerals NL, which
is to take up a fifty percent interest
in these and some other nearby areas.
Central Pacific will be spending
$240,000 over the next two years on
these areas and this sum will be matched
by Magellan itself to give a total of
$400,000. Progress should be quite in-
teresting as the work already carried
out by Magellan has delineated several
definite magnetic anomalies.
Should commercial quantities of ore
be established, the company expects to
have no difficulty in obtaining suffici-
ent water owing to the underground
supplies that Magellan has found as a
result of its previous drilling for oil.
So far, the problems of remoteness in
the area have meant that only com-
panies mining high-grade ore, like
Peko-Wallsend and Australian Develop-
ment, have been able to withstand the
vagaries of fluctuating metal prices for
any length of time. The area has been
the graveyard of many mining com-
panies in years gone by.


Tip Top are first in the national market,
with possibly up to one-third of the
commercial business (that is excluding
sales made by retail shops baking their
own cakes on the premises). There are
six factories in this division in N.S.W.,
Queensland, Western Australia,- and
New Zealand, and, along with cakes,
Big Ben pies are also produced in Syd-
ney and Perth. The annual rate of
growth for Top Taste and the asso-
ciated products is about 12J percent.
One interesting sideline, and the only
retail venture by the Weston group in
Australia, is in the operation of some
60 shops mainly selling cakes and, in
some instances, confectionery, but also
including some restaurants such as the
“Shingle Inn” in Brisbane. Westons
are synonymous in many countries of
the world for biscuits, and along with
Westons (Sydney), Phoenix (Mel-
bourne), and Websters (Brisbane)
labels, the biscuit division accounts for
about 14 percent of the Australian
biscuit market.
In November, 1965, Watson Foods
was acquired in Perth, and with this
acquisition the group entered into the
processing and distribution of ham,
bacon, smallgoods, butter, and cheese.
In 1966/67, two companies producing
potato crisps and nut confections were
acquired in Perth, and in January,
1968, a new company, Geraldton Meat
Exports, opened an abattoir in Gerald-
ton (W.A.). The Weston group is re-
ported well pleased with its diversifica-
tion into meat, and without being
plagued by the bad seasons in the
eastern States of Australia, fortune has
smiled on them.

Westons’ balance in December and the
1967 published accounts are not yet
available for detailed comparison with
previous years. The preliminary profit
announcement just released shows an
increase of 4.9 percent in pre-tax profit
and 2.5 percent in net earnings in the
calendar year 1967 compared to 1966,
whilst dividends for the full year at 4
cents is up 0.25 cents on the preceding
year.
At $1.05 the dividend yield is 3.6
percent and the price earnings multiple
is 12.3. For the long-term investor, I
would recommend Westons as a good
stock to buy and hold.
Security analysis
Top Taste and Tip Top
W. GARFIELD WESTON turned 70
in February, 1968. The son of a small
Toronto baker, he has amassed in his
own lifetime the largest food empire
controlled by one family. Companies
under his umbrella collectively make
up the third-ranking food complex in
the world with annual sales of SU.S. 4
billion, about 70 percent of which is in
Canada and the U.S, and the balancing
30 percent in the U.K, Europe, Africa,
Australia, and New Zealand.
Weston-controlled companies rank as
the largest bakers in the world; one of
the largest millers in the world; they
control the fourth-largest supermarket
chain in the U.S.; they make up the
largest wholesale and retail food groups
in Canada; they also operate one of the
largest supermarket chains in both
Britain and West Germany. They own
Fortnum and Mason, the exclusive
Piccadilly (London) department store,
and for the ordinary folk they run a
chain of London teashops.
One of the key holding companies
in the Weston world is Associated
British Foods Ltd, based in London,
which in 1967 operated 148 bakeries,
88 flour mills, and 84 other factories on
three Continents, and employed some
75,000 people. Although Garfield
Weston is still active president of ABF,
his son, Garry H. Weston, aged 40, was
appointed chairman of the Company
in August, 1967, and in that capacity
has taken over responsibility for the
day-to-day running of the group. For
the 14 years prior to his appointment
as chairman, he was in Australia as his
father’s representative for the group
activities here. ABF is represented in
Australia and New Zealand by the 80
percent subsidiary, George Weston
Foods Ltd, which' has been publicly
listed since May, 1965. With annual
sales running at over $lOO million, the
Australian and New Zealand group may
represent only 2 or 3 percent of the
\yeston family empire in world-wide
sales, but in this part of the globe it
is a very sizable chunk of food inter-
ests ,82 companies, 64 . factories,
8300 people.
Since raising the Weston flag in Aus-
tralia in May, 1949, with the acquisition
of the Gartrell White bakery in Syd-
ney and the Golden Crust . Bakery in
Adelaide, the food interests now range
far and wide. There is a good chance
that you probably buy Tip Top Bread
and crumpets, Top Taste cakes, Big
Ben pies (if you live in Sydney or
Perth), biscuits by Westons, Phoenix,
or .Webster, the rye crisp bread Ryvita;
and for Western Australia, Weston
group companies will sell you Watsonia
ham, bacon, smallgoods, butter and
cheese, Samboy potato crisps, and
Nobby’s nuts.
In the current composition of turn-
over, bread represents about 36 per-
cent; flour, starch glucose, gluten, stock-
feed, poultry meat collectively about
22 percent; cake and biscuits about 21
percent; meat and by-products and
snack foods about 18 percent.
Bread is baked in 28 plants seven
in N.S.W., six in Victoria, four in
Queensland, three in S.A., four in
W.A, one in A.C.T, and three in New
Zealand. The Weston people probably
do 30-35 percent of the bread business
in the metropolitan areas of Australia
and New Zealand.
Westons entered flour-milling in Aus-
tralia in 1962 with the takeover of
N. B. Love Industries Ltd, Sydney,
and they now operate a total of seven
flour mills spread over the five main-
land States. Unlike the flour-millers
who were forced into bread baking to
secure captive flour outlets when Aus-
tralian flour export sales plummeted in
the 19505, Westons’ plants can absorb
by far the greater proportion of flour
produced by the company’s mills. With
flour-milling, Westons’ interests have ex-
tended into the related areas of starch/
glucose, gluten, and stock feed seven
additional processing centres are oper-
ated by the milling division. N. B. Love’s
glucose factory at Enfield (Sydney) was
the first of its kind in Australia and one
of the most modern in the world.
There is an increasing demand for
starch by industrial users, notably by
the aluminium and paper industries;
and the N. B. Love new starch and
gluten mill at South Coogee, Perth
(opened in July, 1967), is strategically '
placed to supply the requirements of
these industries in the West.
In stockfeed, Love’s “Millmaster”
brand ranks second in the Sydney
market, and the 50 percent associate
company—Wesfeeds Pty. Ltd, Perth
(the 50 percent partner is Westralian
Farmers Co-operative Ltd.) is the
largest producer in Western Australia.
From stockfeed into poultry process-
ing. Although a late starter in this field,
Westons bought control of Donnelley
Bros, and Druce Pty. Ltd. and Keene
and Co. Pty. Ltd. in Sydney (in
September, 1967) and Hamptons Perth
in April, 1968. The group already con-
trols about 6 percent of the Australian
market for poultry meat. Westons rank
about fourth in this now thriving indus-
try, which has seen Australian consump-
tion of poultry meat per head of popu-
lation expanding from 41b. in 1960 to
161 b. in 1966, and to possibly 201 b. in
1968. With interests in two major
poultry genetics groups, Westons have
an integrated operation from the stages
of breeding, through to multiplication,
hatching, growing, and feed milling,
processing and finally to market dis-
tribution.

SHARE YIELDS AND STATISTICS
Apart from momentous political and economic news overseas,
Australian share markets had a relatively quiet week. Investors
interpreted de-escalation of the Vietnam war as unfavorable
news for mineral stocks, and B.H. South lost 25c, CRA 40c,
Consolidated ■ Goldfields 40c, New Broken Hill 30c, Norths
34c, WMC 24c, BHP 2Cc, Peko $1.04. More attention was paid
to uraniums, and Exoil and Transoil were sought after on the
strength of their uranium prospect in South Australia. Other-
wise oils were neglected. There was selective buying of heavy-
weight industrials, recovery stocks, and takeover prospects.

THE LAND
Useful nuclear explosions
A COUPLE OF YEARS ago the Aus-
tralian Water Resources Council gave
a good run-down of the possibilities for
the use of desalination plants in Aus-
tralia. It came to the conclusion that,
though there was a place for such
plants, Australian developments were
unlikely to be based on the use of
nuclear energy. It was more likely that
the first desalination plants here would
use conventional fuels, waste heat, or
solar energy for their heat sources. Like
the Australian Atomic Energy Com-
mission, the AWRC has taken the view
that electricity generation and not
desalination would have to be the
prime purpose of establishing nuclear
power stations in this country, just as
it is in the seventeen countries where
such stations are already established,
are being built, or are planned. In
fact, it is generally agreed among
experts that desalination operations
would have to be a subsidiary' opera-
tion to electricity generation and that
the construction of very large plants
would have, like smaller ones, to be
near centres of high electricity con-
sumption.
The most recent dissertation on the
prospects for the use of nuclear power
for desalination comes from Sir Plarold
Raggatt in his new book “Mountains of
Ore,” in which he explodes the notion
that very large plants using nuclear
energy could be used for desalination
to provide water for the irrigation of
the dry interior of Australia. In his
view, there is no area in Australia where
crops could be grown profitably on a
large scale using water at costs any-
thing like those claimed for any
desalination process either in use or
undergoing development anywhere in
the world. Advocates of the use of
large dual-purpose desalination plants
in the remote parts of Australia over-
look the need to find a market for the
electricity generated. They also over-
look the high pumping and transporta-
tion costs of getting water to remote
spots in the event of such plants being
located near large centres of electricity
consumption:
To clinch the case against the erec-
tion of such plants, Sir Harold argues
that there is still plenty of scope for
greatly increased production of primary
products through improved use of land
and water in the temperate developed
areas of the country. Further, about
70 percent of Australia’s surface water
resources, which lie in the northern
part of the continent, are still largely
unused. All this suggests that any
national water plan should first face
up to the problem of harnessing these
resources and the deployment of them
in areas of maximum economic utilisa-
tion. While authorities in the State
and Commonwealth spheres merely toy
with these problems, the urgency of a
better distribution of available water
has been heavily underscored over the
past two or three years as drought has
struck first one and then another part
of the country, with storages empty
here, yet ample there, and never a
connecting pipe between. Pipe-making
firms, quizzed about the practicability
of laying long-distance pipes, say they
are perfectly feasible even, say, for the
carrying of water from the north to the
south of the continent; and their cost,
though high, would easily be offset by
the mitigating effects in drought-
stricken areas (the Federal Government
has already provided $l5 million relief
for Victoria in the current drought, and
the State budget is carrying at least
another $8 million for it this year, to
which must be added very much bigger
losses of income).
The pros and cons for establishing
a national water-pipe grid linked with
new harnessing projects in the north of
Australia are not discussed in Raggatt’s
new book but, ranging over the possible
peaceful uses of nuclear energy in Aus-
tralia, he throws out a line to the sub-
ject by instancing the feasibility of using
nuclear power explosions in connec-
tion with water conservation. Looking
around Australia, he thinks that the
first project selected w'ould be for this
purpose and would have to be in a
remote area. Fie would like to see the
Commonwealth Government, in co-
operation with one or more of the
States, make a positive move toward
selecting a site for a water-storage pro-
ject in which -nuclear explosions would
be appropriate. He is sure the United
States Atomic Energy Committee
which has, through its ‘‘Ploughshare”

experiments, made the most forward
advances in this field would co-
operate to the full, that the project
would excite world attention, and that it
would be feasible within the terms of the
Limited Nuclear Test Ban, or at least
these could be slightly relaxed to fit it.
The “Ploughshare” experiments in
the U.S. have shown that radiation
effects of this type of cratering ex-
plosion are minimal. So although it
would probably be wise to have the
first one here well away from estab-
lished civilisation it could well be. that
subsequent ones could be used for
blowing up hills to make dams and
reservoirs much nearer, say in the
Mallee, southern Western Australia, and
in western N.S.W. So far, in the U.S-.,
such explosions have been primarily
concerned with underground work in
minerals development, such as in oil-
fields, to increase the porosity and
permiability of reservoir sands. Raggatt
sees similar application here, say at
Mereenie, to expedite the flow of
natural gas.
Already Australian agriculture has
derived great benefit from the use of
radio-isotopes produced by the Aus-
tralian Atomic Energy Commission’s
nuclear reactor at Lucas Pleights near
Sydney. This is a promising start along
the atomic road, but Raggatt thinks it
is high time firm plans were made here
to build a commercial power-producing
reactor as well.

A brief moment
of glory
BELYING ITS ungainly title, “Agri-
cultural research in the south-east of
South Australia and adjacent areas of
Victoria” is a briskly written but
fairly comprehensive compendium. It
has been compiled by the CSIRO in
co-operation with the two State De-
partments of Agriculture concerned
with the region. Mr. E. A. Jackson is
the actual author.
The particular region involved has
been the cradle for much of our pro-
gress in agricultural and biological
knowledge. It was there, for instance,
that the cause and cure of coast disease
was finally resolved. This wasting sick-
ness of ruminants had puzzled genera-
tions of scientists and bedevilled farmers
since olden times in several countries.
The great riddle was solved when, in
1935, the late Dr. Hedley Marston
and Dr. lan McDonald, now Chief
of the CSIRO Division of Animal Phy-
siology, conducted a critical experi-
ment on Mr. R. H. Dawson’s property
near Robe, in the south-east of South
Australia. They showed that the ill-
thrift of the animals was caused by a
dual dietary deficiency of cobalt and
copper. Recognition of the ruminant’s
need of cobalt led eventually to an
understanding of pernicious anaemia
in humans and to the isolation of
vitamin 812, the anti-anaemia factor in
properly constructed diets for non-
ruminants.
The trace-element story more than
any other put Australian agricultural
science on the international map.
Wherever scientific agriculture is taught
the name is known of the little South
Australian town nearest to the pioneer
plots that demonstrated the extra-
ordinary effects on animals and plants
of minute amounts of manganese, cop-
per, cobalt, zinc, and molybdenum
added to the soil. Vast areas of land,
not only in all the Australian States
but in many parts of the world, are still
being rehabilitated for a few cents an
acre as a result of what was discovered
around Robe 30 years ago. Nor should
it be forgotten that the “sub and
super” road to pasture riches also
started in that region.
Besides these interesting reflections
on the immediate past, the booklet in-
cludes a brief historical sketch of the
exploration and settlement of the area.
This, too, provides fascinating and in-
structive reading. Extracts from the
diaries of such people as Lieutenant
James Grant, who named Mount Gam-
bier, Stephen Henty, Major Mitchell,
and Ebenezer Ward are quoted.
Approaching Mount Gam'bier from the
north just on a hundred years ago Ward
was struck by . . the gardens enclos-
ing snug little cottages or farmsteads
presenting a picture of rural beauty
worthy of comparison with the noble
highways of old England.” Several
years earlier Stephen Elenty had
appraised the scene with a much more
pragmatic eye, although he, too, re-
marked on the beauty of the country,
and claimed he would have applied for
a “special survey” (title) had he real-
ised that others coveted it. Also he did
not appreciate that this particular area
lay within the Colony of South Aus-
tralia, which did not permit squatting.
Then in tones strongly reminiscent of
Wild West days in America he says
“. . . we afterwards formed cattle
stations at Mount Gambier, of which we
were subsequently deprived by the
chicanery of some unprincipled indivi-
duals in search of sheep stations.” These
sheepmen, it appears, prospered at first;
Stephen’s letter continues, “the export
in wool alone from the port of Portland
this season (1854) will reach 12,000
bales, or in money value nearly
£300,000, and traffic consequent upon
this is now very great.”
But exploitative grazing by these
“unprincipled individuals” intensified
by the depredations of the rabbit (intro-
duced for his pleasure by a similarly
self-centred fellow residing in the Gee-
long district) took its toll. By 1925
the south-east was supporting fewer
stock than in 1867.


“Graham Kerr says
you should cook
with Wha rifled
Butter?”
rii
Clarified Butter. Pure dairy butter with the
water, salt and curd removed. Butter that
doesn’t splutter and foam when it’s melted,
that won’t catch or burn. As Graham Kerr
says, “Clarified Butter brings out the flavour
of food better than anything else I know".
And, of course, you have to use so little
Clarified Butter—just enough to cover the
bottom of the pan lightly. And you use it at
temperatures much lower than those recom-
mended for other cooking fats and oils. So
protein fibres are cooked much more gently,
food comes to the table so much more
tender. Try this recipe using Clarified
Butter (also sold as Ghee or Butter Oil,
incidentally).
Sa
4 thin veal cutlets
seasoned flour
1 egg, beaten
1 tablespoon milk
dried breadcrumbs
ozs. clarified butter
4 thin slices lemon
2 hard boiled eggs, sliced
4 anchovy fillets
>
Method: Beat veal slices until thin.
Toss in seasoned flour, then dip in egg
and milk mixture. Dip in breadcrumbs
and press with a flat knife. Heat clarified
butter in a heavy pan. Fry the veal slowly
for 10 minutes, turning once. Serve
garnished with slices of lemon, egg and
anchovy fillets.
Yields 4 serves.

SOMETHING
NEW
WITH GRAHAM KERR
How to make
a souffle
in a flurry
CLUNK! The gauntlet hit the kitchen
bench. The very air was bristling with
the challenge.
“We will each make a souffle and
see which is the best,” said The Bulle-
tin’s Cellarmaster Len Evans.
“Jolly good show, old sport,” said the
very English owner of the High Bonnet
Restaurant, Surfers Paradise Gordon
Bedson.
They glared in my direction. “Very
well, gentlemen—choose your weapons.”
“Cheese for me,” said Evans quickly.
“Mine will be a splendid example
of a Souffle Grand Marnier,” said
Bedson.
“Brisbane Prawn Souffle,” said I,
remembering the one miraculous
souffle I made on television. We were
all committed no honorable with-
drawal was possible.
We were to assemble at the Evans’
place, a very appointed four-roomed
cellar, with house attached.
Bedson was obviously ahead on
points at the weigh-in. He had pur-
chased a special souffle dish, found a
source of fresh, new-laid eggs (just
enough for his mixture) and a pris-
tine bottle of Grand Marnier.
Evans preferred to serve his from
some individual glazed-pottery souffles.
I asked Bedson if I might borrow
his, as mine was in the studio.
The night of the souffles arrived.
An urgent call from Evans requested
me to drop in at the milk bar for
some cheese and milk.
I had spent all afternoon trying to
locate some green prawns to no
avail. My recipe was hurriedly
changed to the tinned salmon that we
had in the event of a nuclear attack. „
This wasn’t to be a stag party
our wives came, too. Not only was
our cooking ability on trial it
appeared that our marital status was
also in jeopardy. I have a sneaking sus-
picion that they all regarded our pre-
souffle temperament as yet another dis-
play of masculine immaturity. We
tossed for it, and I went first. Disaster!
Just how much flour for the basic
sauce? So critical is the starch con-
tent that I was forced to ask Evans
if I could borrow a copy of my own
cookbook'to check.
“Is that the big one you gave me
one Christmas?” inquired Evans, mak-
ing it clear that he had not suffered
a heavy points loss by buying it!
They left me alone to create a mas-
terpiece, entering only as I had com-
pleted the mix and turned to my pre-
heated oven.
‘ Ch, I say, old boy smashing
texture,” said Bedson. “Hummph,” said
the eloquent Evans.
“If you will forgive me, gentlemen,
the oven awaits.” The oven awaits! It
was stone cold.
“Oh dear,” said Evans, “didn’t you
put this switch down here?” he asked,
at the same time groping in some in-
accessible niche.
I sat glowering in the corner of the
kitchen watching the stove heating and
my souffle cooling.
“Ha, ha, you’ve got a jolly good
excuse,” Bedson laughed.
“I don’t need one,” I snapped.
Eighteen minutes forty-three seconds
later the red light went out and the
oven was ready.
Evans began to cook, singing snatches
from the Queensland version of “Waltz-
ing Matilda/’ interspersed with “Men of
Harlech” —a great diplomat!
Flour, eggs, huge mounds of cheese
flew around and six individual souffles
were ready for the oven as the second
hand on my underwater souffle timer
reached 40 minutes, and mine made
way for the Evans sextet.
“Bravo I say, old boy, bravo,”
cried Bedson. My souffle was divided
and eaten, melting smooth, just
bavaroise enough for moisture just
set enough to hold. It had risen just
over 2 1-16th inches.
Evans grumbled that he had added
too much cheese, but we all agreed
that the flavor was fantastic.
Bedson approached the stove like
Merlin reincarnate. “You haven’t a
Sheffield Plate silver Georgian table-
spoon, have you? Oh! And a double
boiler for me sauce?”
“No,” said Evans, brushing the cob-
webs off yet another fantastic Hunter.
“Try that teaspoon I nicked from
Lyons’ Corner House.”
Bedson’s glasses began to mist as his
sauce failed to thicken.
“Stir in some flour,” suggested Evans.
“Arrowroot’s the shot,” I advised.
“It’s the ruddy teaspoon,” mumbled
Bedson.
Eventually it was done. Evans and
I were aghast at the 3in. rise, the light
delicate flavor a beautiful souffle.
“I think,” said Evans, “it’s a draw.”
Our wives applauded secretly re-
lieved that they would still be able to
greet each other publicly.
And so we forgot all about it until,
much later, I made a trip to Surfers
Paradise. The manager of their new
radio station told me how Bedson had
claimed a first-prize souffle with a
15-16th-of-an-inch rise on mine.
I am, therefore, forced to say that
Bedson used seven eggs, whereas I used
only three!
CLUNK! - the gauntlet hits the
bench once more.


ARTS AND ENTERTAINMENT
Talking Theatre
Directions among the confusion
by DENIS O'BRIEN
AT A TIME when Jim Sharman and
Co. were pushing against the boun-
daries of conventional theatre with
“Terror Australis,” their sensory experi-
ment at the Jane Street playhouse,
Googie and John were in the Phillip
at the other end of Sydney town —•
and the far side of the theatrical scale
— doing very nicely, thank you, with
the sort of meringue comedy that made
Shaftesbury Avenue such a gay place
40 years ago.
The extremes are significant. Mr.
Sharman and his young followers are
theatrical revolutionaries, God bless
them. They don’t believe in allowing
us to slump back in our stalls, filtering
the onstage action through our de-
tached retinas; they believe that the
only hope for theatre is to get us to
feel, respond, participate. They might
yet use horsewhips on us. Googie and
John, meanwhile, have imported a pre-
tested London farce as evidence of What
The Public Wants.
Enter, middle stage, the Community
Theatre Company, Sydney’s newest
regional group of professionals. This
group has leased and smartly trans-
formed a hall in the North Shore
suburb of Killara and opened for busi-
ness with a production of “The Enter-
tainer,” the allegorical drama John
Osborne wrote when he was a fashion-
able revolutionary in theatre. (Good
heavens! Was that really ten or 11 years
ago?)
Between the extremes, and on either
side of the middle, the J. C. Williamson
organisation continues to bark that the
dullish “Man of La Mancha” is a
revolution in musical theatre, the Old
Alexander Archdale
Tote proceeds with a haphazardly of
old and new styles in its Australian
play season, and the Ensemble deter-
minedly attempts to restore the theatre
to its long-ago role as a social reformer
with “Fortune and Men’s Eyes,” a snarl-
ing piece about homosexuality in a
Canadian prison. With questionnaires
for its patrons and weekly post-play
audience discussions, the Ensemble
seems bent on making everyone an
authority on homosexuality in N.S.W.
jails. These are confusing times in
Sydney theatre.
Yet with all the noisy endeavor there
is a refreshing spirit about such theat-
rical opportunism. And, most important,
audiences are coming back to see what
all the noise is about. Sydney’s Inde-
pendent Theatre regularly has been
logging Friday and Saturday night
queues outside its box-office for its
professional repertory season.
At such a time of modest progress
it is worth inspecting the direction of
theatre in Australia as seen from Syd-
ney. If the public is, at last, finding
television less compulsive (if it does
want more mental and physical exer-
cise), is the sort of theatre it began
neglecting ten or 12 twelve years ago
the sort represented by “Relatively
Speaking,” and even, perhaps, “The
Entertainer” what it finds adequate
on returning? And what of the play-
going generation that has grown up
since television? Would an Australian
play like “This Old Man Comes
Rolling Home” be anything more than
a historical curiosity to a teenager?
The future probably lies more toward
the Rodney Milgate-Jim Sharman
school than it does to the sort of
theatre represented by Mr. and Mrs.
McCallum, but it will be evolutionary,
not revolutionary. The young experi-
menters call for the instant dismissal
of too many theatrical standards and
values to make the quick capture
they’re after.
It is interesting to note that before
the Community Theatre opened, its
director, actor-producer Alexander
Archdale, polled his 800 subscribers
with a list of 107 plays. “The Enter-
tainer” was a popular choice and there
was a marked preference for tragedies.
On the opening night his production
of Osborne’s play almost was a tragedy.
He has sadly miscast himself as the
pathetically jaunty Archie Rice, and
although surrounded by an excellent
company he moved the play so slowly
that it creaked. There was much
slumping in the stalls and shuttering of
retinas. His next production is a
revival of Coward’s “Hay Fever.” In
a strange contradiction of earlier
preferences, the suburban region around
the Community Theatre is booking

heavily for that. The best balance be-
tween the theatrically old and new in
Sydney at present is being struck by
three young me'mbers of the Inde-
pendent’s repertory company in an
Alexander Hay production of “The
Promise,” by Russian author Aleksei
Arbuzov.
The first act is rather too leisurely,
but the playwright holds the interest
in his simple theme of youth pursuing
love and ambition into adulthood and
through to middle-age right to his last
well-formed syllable. The play has the
additional fascination of being from
post-war Russia; the production is
attractive because its cast, Ross Thomp-
son, Patricia Leehy, and Tony
Thurbon, are three young potential
disciples of Mr. Sharman who help to
prove that theatregoing can be a satis-
fying experience without the benefit
of horsewhips.
Teaching tolerance
by PHILLIP ADAMS
Staircase, by Charles Dyer. Directed by
George Fairfax. St. Martins’ Theatre,
Melbourne.
IN THE latest issue of Victoria’s
“Police Journal” a magazine
singularly difficult to come by an
anonymous me'mber of the constabulary
directs some apoplectic prose at a
well-known lady of the Australian
Press. Her crime: allegations of
unjustified persecution of homosexuals
by local police.
The constable, however, insists that
only the thin blue line of his vigilant
colleagues saves Melbourne from the
fate of Gomorrah, and is obviously
unaware of the Wolfenden Report
when he attacks both “perverts” and
their apologists with equal venom.
It would be interesting to expose his
prejudices to “Staircase” the plot
of which begins with a young
constable’s arrest of a has-been
theatrical he catches “in drag.”
First staged in London as a straight
comedy, it has since been rewritten to
emphasise the tragedy implicit in the
situation. The result is a play which
begins by outraging bourgeois sensi-
bilities, ends by teaching tolerance, and,
in between, manages to be more than
usually entertaining.
More than a propaganda piece or a
mere exercise in the exotic, the play
speaks honestly about loneliness and
vulnerability. How much it modified
the audience’s attitude, to homosexuality
is hard to say, but there was a distinct
change in response between first and
final curtain. A noticeable chill in the
air disappeared and there was enthusi-
astic applause for the performers
{Sydney Conabere and John Frawley),
If not for the play’s propositions.
Art
Repressions behind the bark
by ELWYN LYNN
Aboriginal Bark Paintings. Bill Brown,
paintings. Rudy Komon’s, Sydney.
IT WOULD be a valuable exercise for
someone to trace the evolution of the
taste for bark paintings; these fine, in-
tricate, and delicate 40-odd pieces don’t
quite bear the exotic strangeness of that
rough, awkward, and savage prim-
itivism that fascinated the immediate
postwar world which was inclined,
through Dubuffet, to equate the works
of children, madmen, and primitives.
These pieces two are on bark 9ft.
high—are so detailed and refined that
they lack the aura of primitivism;
furthermore, they take so long to do
that their living artists may find simpler,
more immediate modes more profitable.
This, in turn, leads to the loss of
ability and desire to do such patient
work.
Some anthropologists think it in vain
and impossible to relate primitive art
to the structure of the society of which
it was an integral part; what stops me
asking such questions is this one: how
is “Little Red Riding Hood” related to
our society? In any case, anthropol-
ogists, generally aesthetically innocent,
are strangely literal and credulous folk
taking at face value the natives’ simple
explanations of their symbols and never
suspecting that there are repressed or
latent meanings. The paintings are
taken as mere diagrams of belief and
narratives, but amid all the manifest
stories just what is going on with the
incessant ritualistic repetition of forms?
The aesthetic import of these paintings
surely lies between the intellectually
formal and the incantatory.
To say that such import can only
be grasped by understanding art’s tribal
function, or that recent interest just re-
flects a shift in taste, is to avoid exam-
ining the aesthetic qualities of prim-
itive art. Susanne Langer would strgue
that primitive art, despite its varied
uses, was aesthetic at its inception and
that the “arts are actually never a late
addition to civilised life, an ornament
gracing society like tea ceremonies or
etiquette, but are born during the rise
and primitive phases of cultures.” Her
notion that art is the form that makes
apparent otherwise inexpressible feel-
ings simply holds that aesthetic objects
are created and appreciated spontane-
ously without the assurance of a tradi-
tional aesthetic or, naturally, the sup-
port of scholars, critics, and connois-
seurs. These bark paintings, whatever
their past tribal roles, do, in general,
embody the life of feelings in Mrs.
Langer’s sense.
Mowara’s Sacred Waterhole osten-
sibly deals with the famous Wawlag
sisters who symbolise the fertility of
man and nature. They are shown as
black silhouettes near the waterhole
where they live; there is another water-
hole containing three fish, and eight
varied diagonals of black feet show the
movements of the two sisters, who lie
imprisoned in the horizontal lines
which are balanced against the herring-
bone lines, delicately done but so rigid
as to suggest predestination as though
the bark slab was a table of the laws.
But just as the uncertain mind needs
such fixed doctrinal pictures, it cannot
help revealing its uncertainty and the
mass of herringbone lines waver and the
black tracks have the optical effect of
wanting to fall sideways from the
painting. We hold the two sisters in
rigid lines, but how certain can we be
of their blessings; implicit with the pre-
sentation of tribal belief is their ques-
tioning.
The same notion of the necessity of
doctrine amid the flux informs the
Yurrakala scene that depicts water rats,
fish, chicks, and waterlilies afloat on the
surface of an ever-shifting mosaic of
sets of lines that form closely packed
but surprisingly fluid forms; the water-
lilies, a delight in themselves, revolve
slowly as the whole painting pulsates,
smoothly; the world teems with life,
and no one knows where the waters of
life will flow. Most of the works have
a relaxed control, though the spotted
Water Pythons menace a little and
Woman Hunting, with its flaccid, fleshy
areas pursued and fenced by close pat-
terns, is more symbolically daring.
Daring is 22-year-old Bill Brown, an
expressionist popster who, in openly
acknowledging his kinship with White-
ley, Garry Shead, and John Firth-
Smith, creates more loosely rapturous
work than they, partly because he uses
so'me action-painting’s fluid, massive-
turbulence and partly because he can
charge large areas with feelings. Bour-
bon Beau Black is mainly an expanding
and frame challenging black-grey given
cohesion by a small area of black-and-
white stripes, and given still tenderness
by a faded, dusty pink silver. He uses
collages of small flags to obtain similar
stillness in paintings where waves of
color riot around the unruffled flag—
like Rorke’s Drift done in action paint.
In The Old 1-2-3, which is a des-
peration of blue and green on, perhaps,
a racecourse, a vigorous, savage color
has reappeared in local painting that’s
been cooling it rather monotonously.
Like the Aboriginal painters he’s en-
tranced by the flux, but is little con-
cerned with its control. It’s fine to see
an heir of action painting in such
robust health when we are so often
told that the line has died out.

Magnificent
madness
by PHILLIP ADAMS
The Persecution and Assassination of
Jean-Paul Marat as Performed by the
Inmates of the Asylum of Charenton
Under the direction of the Marquis
de Sade. Director, Peter Brooks.
Dendy Cinema, Melbourne.
FRANCE, 1808. In the company of
bourgeois friends we’ve been invited to
a play being presented by the inmates
of the Asylum for the Insane at Char-
enton. The theatre is the institution’s
tile-lined bath-house and our host is
that enlightened reformer Monsieur
Coulmier, who encourages these pro-
ductions, believing the'm to be a useful
form of group therapy.
From our seats in the darkness, we
watch inmates stumble into the glare.
Some, like the play’s author-producer,
the Marquis de Sade, are wearing the
Members of the Royal Shakespeare
Company in the filmed version of
“Marat/Sade”
frayed remnants of their finery. The
rest, with shaven heads, slouch and
shamble in the loose, unbleached uni-
forms. The nuns in their winged hats
stand serenely on guard, bludgeons
hanging beside their rosary beads.
Such performances are regular, if
somewhat controversial, events in Paris,
however, tonight’s production is caus-
ing Coulmier extra anxiety as it con-
cerns the assassination of Jean-Paul
Marat, the revolutionary leader mur-
dered by Charlotte Corday 15 years
before.
Marat had spent much time hiding
in the Paris sewers, where he had con-
tracted an agonising skin disease. For
years, the only relief he could find was
In constant immersion in water. So we
see the actor who’ll play the part
climbing into his bath. The others,
hideous as the apparitions of Belsen,
take their place around him. A chorus
of four lunatics in paint and plumes
position themselves by the manacled
organist, and with a nod from the
Marquis the play begins.
Peter Weiss’ script involves de Sade
in a long argument with the actor play-
ing Marat on the nature of freedo : m,
humanity, and violence. It is based
loosely on documented fact (de Sade
did produce such plays with his night-
mare company at Charenton), and
began the debate on the theatre of
cruelty. After “Marat/Sade,” Bonnie
and Clyde turn out to be merely chips
off the Weiss guillotine. For two hours,
Weiss insists that you take sides in the
argument in all argument but
gives little indication as to which side
he himself supports.
Before writing “Marat/Sade,” Weiss
(a Jew who escaped Germany in 1934)
felt himself to be both stateless and
without political orientation. His writ-
ing was a dialectic war with himself,
in which he tried to find a position to
hold. After the first production, he an-
nounced himself to be a Marxist, insist-
ing that he had been on Marat’s side
in the argu'ment all along. However,
the text does not support this con-
tention, for de Sade’s individualistic
views are given at least equal expres-
sion, and his contempt for political
solutions is treated with respect by the
author. Weiss must have made his
decision as a member of the audience,
for it was not 'made in the writing.
The work is remarkable as film.
Brooks, who directed “Lord of the
Flies,” hasn’t been content with conven-
tional 'multi-camera coverage. Each shot
has been carefully plotted and lit and
is uncanny in its precision. I’ve never
before noticed film credits for “focus,”
but soon realised their significance. For
the film depends on the shallowest
imaginable focus, with faces looming
into the lens while the background fig-
ures distort and disintegrate. Then the
foreground will melt as focus flows
through a vortex of frenzied activity as
the ghastly performers mime the tum-
brils in the crowded streets. Thus foc-
using replaced camera 'movement and
editing as the primary source of visual
impact and emphasis.
On every level and in all its aspects,
the film is remarkable. The color, the
performances of the Royal Shakespeare
Company, the music and costumes are
all, to put it simply, exactly right. See-
ing these elements working in complete
harmony ones realises as never before
the wrongness of color, music, acting,
and design in inferior productions; that
is, the remaining 99 percent of films
and plays produced.
[United Artists, the distributors of
“Marat/Sade,” have imported only one
print of the film into Australia. Until
it began a season at Melbourne’s
Dendy cinema it had been screened
only in Perth. A Sydney release is
uncertain; it depends, apparently,
upon finding an exhibitor with the
commercial courage to show it!]

OPERA IS in the air and the record
co'mpanies are cashing in. Past record-
ings of “La Traviata” have persistently
refused to satisfy the customers. Best
until now was the Decca with Joan
Sutherland but, while that lady un-
doubtedly has a greater voice than
Montserrat Caballe, her personal idio-
syncrasies do not sit easily on the
shoulders of Verdi’s immortally dying
heroine. Caballe scores over her famous
rival on several counts: better diction,
greater dramatic impact, and the ability
to sound genuinely and fatally ill. There
are some nice touches to show that some
thought has gone into this interpreta-
tion; to name an obvious and early
example: she takes the end of the
“Follie, follie!” introduction to “Se'mpre
libera” softly, a lovely idea which gives
a touch of humanity to Violetta at a
point where she is usually no more than
a typical and very healthy prima
donna. Caballe’s Alfredo is the same as
Sutherland’s, the übiquitously excellent
Carlo Bergonzi.
Montserrat Caballe and Elena
Suliotis appear to be fighting for the-
mantle of Callas. It is an unequal and
unnecessary battle. Caballe is an experi-
enced artist, making hay late in life
for our edification. Suliotis is an
exciting youngster of 25 or so who can,
if she acts wisely, eclipse her current
and past rivals. She is vocally a more
exciting singer than Callas was at her
age and promises to become a fine
actress, though one wonders whether
Callas’ innate personal magnetism is
present. Singing of this calibre ensures-
success regarding of age; in this case
it also holds promise of fantastic things
to come:
In “Beatrice di Tenda” Joan Suther-
land is supported almost totally by
singers who appeared here in 1965.
Cornelius Opthof has the largest sup-
porting role as Filippo, Beatrice’s-
villainous husband, and acquits himself
lightly but well. Great interest lies in
the first major appearance of Luciano
Pavarotti as the over-pure lover,
Orombello. It is good to see Pavarotti’s
promise fulfilled, though his part is
comparatively s'mall. Josephine Veasey,
the only “outsider,” is very good indeed
as Agnese, who loves Orombello, who
loves Beatrice, who loves Filippo, who
loves Agnese it’s that kind of a plot.

Radio
Backchat has
a birthday
by SANDRA HALL
THE TALKBACK program one of
the more mystifying eruptions in Aus-
tralian commercial radio is a year
old this week. As if to celebrate the
event, 2SM, its most dedicated disciple,
has. just demonstrated its unswerving
devotion to the cult by inaugurating
its fifth talkback program.
2SM now. broadcasts these programs
for 52 hours a week, scanning most of
the tried and tested two-way tones from
the “social service” attitude employed
at times by Garvin Rutherford to Ron
Casey’s conscientiously maintained air
of belligerence.
The talking newcomer is Brian Bury,
previously "known as a television news-
reader and billed by 2SM as “informed,
authoritative ... a natural stickybeak
intensely interested in people.” His ap-
pointment was announced by the stat-
ion manager, Kevin O’Donohue, in a
high-minded Press release calling
phone-in programs “a vital and neces-
sary part of the role radio must play,”
and presenting an interesting study in
contrasts with Mr. Casey’s abrasive
style, if you care to make it.
Citing the popularity of a Los
Angeles station which has been pro-
gramming two-way telephone shows for
the past two years, O’Donohue says he
sees no signs of their demise (“they
used to ask the same question of ‘top
40’ programs, but they’re still with
us”), and confidently attributes 2SM’s
25 percent improvement in ratings in
the recent Sydney survey to phone-in
programs. 2SM is even considering in-
troducing yet another show of this
kind.
Radio 2UE, which is second to 2SM,
with 20 hours a week, topped the sur-
vey, but 2UW, a station which has not
bothered with the phone-in programs
since the others began embracing them
so enthusiastically, was near the top,
too.
Breakfast programs seem established
as those which rate highest, although
2SM has found Rugby League broad-
casts more popular than anything else.
And at 2UE, John Laws, purveying his
slightly cooler brand of professional
anger over the telephone, polled equally
with Bob Rogers behind the breakfast
show, while Ormsby Wilkins, with his
paternal image of a radio ombudsman,
experienced a slight setback in ratings.
The first phone-in program was aired
by 2UW and conducted by Robert
Kennedy as early as 1965, but it was
short-lived, since the PMG stepped in
to prohibit “live” broadcasts of this
kind.
Nevertheless, the stations went on
agitating for them, and when they
acquired equipment to effect a seven-
second delay between recording tele-
phone calls and broadcasting them, the
PMG was satisfied and they went ahead.
Ironically, 2UW, after its early
pioneering, disdained to participate in
the general rush to the telephones, and
in Sydney, only 2SM and 2UE intro-
duced programs immediately, while
2GB hung back, using the phone only
for occasional interviews during their
current affairs programs.
Later, Andrea had a brief brush with
it, but her loyal listeners seemed so
abashed at the sudden opportunity for
telephone confrontation with radio’s
grande dame that at times, the pro-
gram threatened to develop into an
Andrea admiration society.
At present, the Australian airwaves
are humming long and vociferously
with talk-back programs. In addition
to the formidable Sydney line-up, every
State capital but Hobart has at least
one station broadcasting them—3AW,
3AK, and 3DB in Melbourne, 4BH and
4BK in Brisbane, SAD in Adelaide, 6IX,
6PR, and 6PM in Perth. The question
is—when will people tire of the sound
of their own voices?

The cost of
"bird" watching
by DENIS O'BRIEN
PUBLIC opinion rarely has been so
unanimous about a television program:
the Australian Broadcasting Commis-
sion’s contribution to “Over the
Equator,” the satellite exchange with
Japan, was a disgrace. It’s worth re-
membering, too, that the ABC’s bits
and pieces for “Our World” last
year’s proof that instantaneous global
telecasting is possible weren’t very
impressive, either. In its noisy desper-
ation to beat the commercial stations
in the ratings game the national net-
work obviously is beginning to neglect
its national responsibilities.
At present there’s enough evidence
to suggest that ABC-TV is treating the
communications satellite system like a
new toy rather than an effective tool.
Using Intelsat II to bring President
Johnson’s momentous speech across the
Pacific within the same day was smart
work, although the “This Day Tonight”
crew lost its customary cool and sur-
rounded the event with its own wordy
marathon that trailed off with Eric
Hunter talking about Johnson’s gall
bladder, and Brian Joyce desperately
urging Dame Mabel Brookes to say
nothing of interest. The next day the
ABC breathlessly announced it would
use the satellite again on May 31, be-
cause it had “bought the exclusive Aus-
tralasian rights” to the 1968 India-
napolis 500-mile race. It’s difficult to
imagine the commercial boys envying
such “exclusivity.” What next? The
annual frog-jumping contest in Mark
Twain country?
Judged by its early eagerness, ABC-
TV might have to call on the Treasury
for more money to meet the cost of
satellite telecasting, or if the bill is to
be met from the existing budget, then
the drama, rural, sport, light enter-
tainment, and religious departments
will have to watch that the News and
Public Affairs men don’t brashly spend
everyone’s share of the dollar just for
the sake of bringing in a live picture
from the other side of the world.
It costs about $lO,OOO an hour to
relay a TV program from New York
to Sydney, by way of the “bird,” as
Intelsat II is known to technicians. All
program production costs are extras.
The hourly rate is expected to drop
by 15 percent by the end of 1969, when
three more “birds” in the Intelsat series
are due to be orbiting. The ABC off-
loaded some of the cost of the Johnson
speech by arranging a last-minute split
with the Nine Network (and then
cheekily superimposed the ABC symbol
on the picture every few minutes), but
Mr. Duckmanton’s accountants will
have the bill for the Australian end of
the Indianapolis telecast to themselves.


Beer Hall mob talk of Mr. Butterfry
to me when it becomes apparent, after
several more Saturday booze-ups, that
we are spending much time together
like a transmogrified version of Abbott
and Costello. True enough: for a
couple of months he is my little mate
coarse, sore of spirit, restless as a
maggot, and perpetually steeped, even
at his gayest and bawdiest, in a rage
against something he has not, although
he never stops talking of himself, got
to the point of directly revealing.
As we drive about the countryside
to get orders for margarine or pine-
apple juice or plastic watering-cans,
miles of autobiography stream from
him, a mish-mash of superhuman
sexual feats, quasi-criminal triumphs of
diddling and putting-over, and
decelerating happinesses. I come to see
that he has been unable to betray his
type, his gift of the infirmities and
spivvish vigors accompanying Blue-
ness, that his life is movement but not
progress and that, just as he drinks with
the ritualistic appetite of children and
drunks, which has nothing to do with
thirst, so he snatches (or used, when
younger, to snatch) with ritualistic
fever at the unworthiest of satisfac-
tions. He has, I more and more sus-
pect, built a life not to be built on
and added to but burned down, a life
without consolations or myths.
When I knew him in Kure, long
before he had swopped himself and
cheekiness for Mr. Butterfry and his
strange choler, he was one of the
shrewdest and most successful of Black
Markdt operators. Myself a non-starter,
I was embedded in operator friends
and acquaintances: ungentlemanly
officers from my Mess, colonels’ la-di-
da wives, cow-eyed mothers-of-three,
acne-embossed children from the school
for officers’ offspring, fluke-riddled
houseboys, virgin canteen assistants
from the YWCA, devirginised nurses
from the Army hospital. Mr. Butterfry,
not yet out of his chrysalis, outshone
them by many watts. His rocking-horse
nostrils objectified his genius for smell-
ing out. Even more zealously than he
sniffed around the White Rose, the
amateurish strip-tease shows of the
Naka-dori, and the major’s housegirl,
whom he courted with presentos of
skeins of wool, lengths of Habutai silk,
and scanties of imitation black lace, he
sniffed around and into the Black Mar-
ket heart of the back alleys, his face
boyishly crinkled and winningly
freckled, his eyes motionless as six-
pences, his gruesome voice inexorably
sawing away at any branch in the way.
He had come to a dishevelled country
which seemed to make promises, to
drop hints. He had ears to hear and,
having heard, the skill to turn promises
and hints into lovely filthy money.
How he was able to stay on in
Japan after Occupation troops with-
drew is a triumph he missed telling
me of. He became rich. At a time
when the starving natives were mak-
ing hashes of cats and sacred temple
deer, suburban Tokyo houses could be
bought for the proceeds from the
Black Market sale of a couple of car-
tons of Lucky Strike cigarettes. Mr.
Butterfry owned five such houses as
well as a beach house at Atami, and a
mountain retreat at Chuzenji. He
married the major’s housegirl, who was
able to lady it over housegirls of her
own. Two children were born, two
girls.
He had, so to speak, come all the
way from Gippsland and boyhood to
catch his unicorn, had caught, and
corralled it. He could have consented
to be mollified by being some kind of
expatriate rentier. Not he. Con-men
outwit themselves. Maybe there were
events outside himself, outside idiot
extravagance and jettisoned common-
sense, outside his own lack of foresight,
which led to downfall. The lusty Black
Market, for instance, sickened, grew
worse, died. This is not entirely as he
understands it or, rather, as I under-
stand he understands it.
As he drives through the Progress-
devastated hills and dales littered with
bulldozers and concrete-mixers, now
and then interrupting his high-pitched
and blasphemy-larded monologue to
gulp rum from the bottle we share
like unholy infants, it gradually be-
comes patent that he regards himself
as having a mystical bond with
catastrophe. Some It or They beyond
conventional mishap has had it in for
him since before he was baptised
Gregory R. Patience, and long before
he was the scorned Mr. Butterfry. I
should like to say, “For God’s sake,
you’ve got a job, a house, a car, an air-
conditioner, an Omega watch, and a
gut full of rum. Relax, mate, relax!” or
“Look here, you’ve been crimming
around just this side of the law for
years. What did you expect to expect?”
Instead I plug my mouth with that
of the rum bottle.
He finds, no repose in the absurd
Victim of Fate verdict he has come
to. His dismay at being down to his
last house and last car has the quality
of hostility. With an impercipience so
incredible that it dazzles me as if
he were a genius moron, he has desig-
nated himself a martyr and a
furious one.
The martyrdom, I notice, habitually
has Japan as its backdrop or, rather,
always seems always to have its cli-
max at the core of a contretemps,
twilight and sinister, which has been
magicked in a jiffy out of radiant high
noon by an ectoplasmic but evilly
Japanese agency. I suspect, however,
that the faceless fate, the voodoo in
the woodheap who or which enrages
him, is bandily biped, homo sapiens,
common as dirt, Mr. Butterfry him-
self.
When his bouts or railing become
too strident and dotty I want to say,
“For God’s sake, Blue, give it a rest.
Why don’t you just shut up shop here,
and shoot back home before you get
too decrepit to be racing around flog-
ging frozen mutton and Pommy
gin?” This is out of the question,
and not to be done because it
is not the thing to do: I have no
licence. His having, despite the auto-
biographical incontinence, not stripped
away all the rinds from his privacy
and, surely, deliberately - seems
a warning to come no closer, to keep
my shut mouth shut. It is an attentive
ear he has invited to accompany him
on his trips to sell condensed milk,
not a questioning tongue.
Perhaps I could safely, during his
maudlin outbursts of it’s-just-a-little-
street-where-old-friends-meet home-
sickery, have asked why he does not-
cut the Japan painter, and whip his
wife and daughters off to Australia.
Per-haps. I decide, however, not to
ask, and listen to the one-after-
umpteenth edition of his dreamlike
passion (he does not know how dream-
like, and I have no right to tell him)
to retire and settle down his words
in a little Gippsland fishing port
he was last in over twenty years ago.
Because I knew this Sleepy Hollow
place as he knew it, I understand
at least, as much as someone who has
no daydream at all can understand
his fantasy of playing the well-to-do
beachcomber there, the weather for-
ever halcyon, the fish always biting, the
weatherboard pub never closed. I see
what Mr. Butterfry sees: the palsied
red gum wharves stacked with cray-
fish pots, the indolent reed-fringed
river seething with bream, the Shy-
lock-bearded goats under the Norfolk
Island pines, the sandy side-streets of
bluestone cottages behind hedges of
looking-glass shrubs and lad’s love.
Yes, I should like to say, “Go back!”
but dare not, cannot. If he is trying
to change himself into something else,
he must use his own wand.
Anyway, whatever nebulous but vin-
dictive force he accuses of hounding
him into a cul-de-sac, I incline nearer
to a certainty that inertia of will, is to-
blame, that he is his own victim, his
own chained and captious mongrel.
From my seat there is little else to see.
Then, one night, as if he has
flash! boom! become clairvoyant
about my unput questions and secret
judgment or as if he has been pro-
foundly considering them for weeks,,
and has reached a decision, suddenly,
utterly apropos of nothing external t»
his own mind, he says, with electri-
fying and ugly vehemence, “Yeah, by
Christ, yeah! I will. Yeah, I’ll showya;
I’ll bloody showya, mate.”
He is drunker than I have ever
seen him, maybe because I am so
many undrunk drinks more sober than
is usual in his company as to be prac-
tically maiden. We are well within
the outskirts of Tokyo, driving back
from Otsugi and the United States
Naval Air Station where, having got


much larger orders for gin and Kobe
steaks and plastic baseball-team jac-
kets than he foresaw, he has over-
celebrated in the officers’ bar.
Now, early night, eight o’clock,
seventy miles an hour, out of the blue:
“I’ll bloody showya, mate/’
not the wispiest notion of
what he is. getting at, “Good for you;
I can hardly wait,” I say, and, “Show
me what?” I expect no more than
some super-dive as yet unknown to
me, some special coven of bedizened
monkey-women with unflinching
snow-white smiles whose hatred of
Mr. Butterfry is at the peak, who are
already lined up with their tumblers
of petrol and an Esper electronic
cigarette-lighter. “Show me what,
master?”
“You’ll see. You’ll see.” For the first
time I realise that the adolescent
falsetto, grating and grinding, is old,
older than he is, as the noise of the
glacier to move is older than
the glacier itself. “You’ll see. I’ll bloody
showya what it’s bloody like.” He stops.
The primeval sound stops.
Silence . . . and silence.
Silence from him is another first-
time experience, and an unnerving one.
Momentarily I am aghast. The ven-
triloquist has left the scene. No mat-
ter, the doll drives on. The doll, worn-
out and voiceless, with its ginger curls
and flat glass eyes, drives on, robot-
perfect, at perilous speed. I am host
to a nightmare fancy: he and I, the
mute-residue of Mr. Butterfry and I,
are to spend eternity together, alone
together, fixed side by side in the front
seat of a runaway Nissan Gloria which
he will steer violently around corner
after corner, cutting deeper and
deeper and ever deeper into a maze of
unnamed streets, a labyrinth of empty
catless alleys, all utterly deserted and
silent —.locked houses, shuttered shops,
unlit street-lights, blind walls, smoke-
less chimneys, telegraph poles propping
up the dead filaments of a vast cobweb
that has no edge and no centre.
It seems unreal, therefore, when he
pulls up in a suburban street of real-
seeming passersby, with overhead
lamps, and the television gabble of “I
Love Lucy” in dubbed Japanese. The
street is not much chop, but not seedy,
rather claustrophobic from the eight-
foot walls of grey concrete on each side
in which are set the fake rural gateways
leading to the houses behind. As Mr.
Butterfry gets out at one of the gates
he speaks again.
“Home,” he: says. “Home sweet
bloody home.” This has the intonation
of Hell sweet bloody hell. “Get crack-
ing, y’ bastard. Y’ gonna meet the
wife.” In such situations I am the
Pavlov rat my hand fossicks for the
comb.
As he opens the gate I ask, “What’s
her name?” I ask because, in the Kure
days, she was one of the Mess house-
girls, and it seems possible that she
might expect from me the politeness
of remembering if she were Fumiko-
san, Kiyoko-san, Setsuko-san, or What-
ever-san. I am simply after rainy day
material to play the game of being
well mannered with.
Mr. Butterfry behaves as though I
am asking for my own name. He goes
immobile and pensive and, after a
pause, turns his head, arranges that his
eyes are on me, as on a defective, and
after an unbelieving examination of
something behind my face, says fret-
fully, “I married the bastard, di’n’t I?”
What does he mean?
“Whattay’ think her bloody name is?
Mrs. Hirohito? Mrs. Duchess of Wind-
sor? It was for real, amigo. She’s Mrs.
Patience all right.” Ah well. Next, as
though the name is other and* more
than authentic, as though information
is not the true centre of the circle, he
says it again, “Mrs. Patience.” His
burnt-out lips make the two words the
filthiest I have ever heard. His face
is that of a vole in a trap. Had I any
trust in imagination I would accept,
right there, outside the gate of crooked
branches, the catalogue of answers
which has flashed on the screen of
my mind, and would dramatically re-
member any appointment anywhere,
and excuse myself to hurry off in the
direction of anywhere with his “Auf
wienerschnitzel, chico!” gimletting my
eardrums. I have no trust in the imag-
ination. I follow Mr. Butterfry toward
Mrs. Patience, and the living-room.
The Japanese living-room with its
floor of padded matting, its paper
shutters, inconspicuous shut cupboards,
sole ornament, and no furniture, has
a spartan and spurious refinement. In
attempting the affectation of making
an art of the skeletal and parsimonious,
it imposes the harrowing discomfort of
poverty. It is a sort of fragile hut
that can quickly become a pigsty hut,
kept scrupulously shipshape, ungarn-
ished as an empty bird-cage, it gives
the illusion of being the acme of
abominably good taste. Of such a
room, a large one obviously the total
of two former rooms, Mr. Butterfry
and Mrs. Patience, and their half-
caste daughters, Lana, seventeen, and
Shirley, thirteen, have made an illus-
trative and crudely gorgeous museum of
their lives. It is the very zenith of
abominably bad taste.
The area set aside, as it were, for
Mr. Butterfry’s exhibit is dominated by
a cocktail bar as flashily outrageous
and sparkling as the altar of a Mexi-
can cathedral, and his treasures are
arranged near the monstrosity, or fes-
tooned above and about it; scores of
goliath or obscene bottle-openers;
scores of needlessly ingenious and fan-
tastic cigarette-lighters; the stencilled
felt pennants of Australian Navy ships,
life-saving clubs, and football teams;
several richly framed oil-paintings of
Gippsland landscapes by old-fashioned,
once-esteemed Impressionist artists;
and a squad of atrocious Made-in-
Japan statuettes, all either off-color
or selfconsciously pornographic the
Pis-Manneken, Leda and the Swan,
Europa and the Bull, Cupid and
Psyche, that sort of thing. It is the
bazaar of a rich little poor boy.
In his unpunctuated soliloquies about
himself Mr. Butterfry has repeatedly
let fall, maybe as incidental self-tribute,
that his half-breed daughters are
popular as photographic or commercial
television models. I have taken popular
to mean used twice or thrice rather
than once. How wrong. In the junk-
shop congestion the most discom-
posing objects are the overlapping
posters which, from ceiling to floor,
cover the walls with bar-hostess smiles,
and eyes and eyes and eyes. On every
hand Lana toys with, holds up, or
archly indicates Mikimoto pearls, an
Instamatic camera, a deer-skin purse, a
Hi-Cook Fryer, a sterec-monaural tape-
recorder, or a goblet of Mercian wine.
Elsewhere she emerges from a scarlet
Compagno Spider roadster or a mink
coat, or is discovered in the company
of a comely young man amid the art
nouveau conceits of Maxim’s de Paris
de Tokyo. Meantime, dozens of poster
Shirleys enact, from under a tar-black
fringe, or from between horizontal pig-
tails, childish rapture over tinned beef
curry, effervescing cordials, bottled
tangerines, homogenised milk, seaweed
drinks, and lurid sorbets.
In appearance —the posters prove it
over and over again Lana and
Shirley are unsulliedly Japanese, raci-
ally untainted. No physical trace shows
of the blue-eyed Mr. Butterfry with the
paprika-tinted freckles blotching his
forehead, and sprinkled among the red-
gold grass on the backs of his hands.
He might never have impregnated,
never have set foot in Japan, never
even have existed. His daughters could
be copy-cat versions of an infinity of
ancestresses as they are copy-cat ver-
sions of the oh-so-sweet-and-cute house-
girl one used to see mincing pigeon-
toed between the canna-beds of the mess
garden toward the sentry box where
her Black Marketeer lover bobbed up
and down like a Jack-in-the-box. Visu-
ally, the daughters are amoeboid
breakaways from no one except Mrs.
Patience.
Her indubitable contribution to the
museum is a perfect illustration of what
happens when the Japanese move one
millimetre off the strait of their national
taste into the complex cross-currents of
non-Japanese taste. Richelieu-work
antimacassars hang on obese settees of
glossy brocade; the carpet arabesques of
unsubdued colors pulsate and twitch
beneath the light of a plethora of
frilled lampshades; two china cabinets
and a glass-fronted sideboard are stoked
with the white-hot brilliance of cut-
glass vessels; urns of blue velvet roses
are disposed on pedestals of fictitious
marble; little lace-shrouded tables are
burdened with trinkets and figurines.

centre of this intemperance is, Mr.
Butterfry says, her, Mrs. Patience. He
could be introducing me to a leper.
She acknowledges me by making a
cryptic minor adjustment to her expres-
sion, no more. Her eyes are on her
husband, as on a snake.
Out of context I should never have
recognised the ex-housegirl any more
than I recognised Mr. Butterfry at the
Lion, and it can only be illusion that,
in the taut creature in its dusky
kimono, I think I discern vestiges of
what I think she was once like. I do
instantly recognise something else. How
could I not? Outside the gate of tor-
tured branches my mind had in a flash
warned that, just as in all the bars
with their inimical hostesses, so in the
last of Mr. Butterfry’s seven houses, so
in this preposterously bizarre room.
Here, too, the captive air is wounded
by the vixen’s smile, radiantly bitter,
by the eyes implacable and pitiless.
Does she, too, call him Mr. Butterfry?
He is behind his bar, under the
stalactites of football and life-saving
pennants, pouring this and that to make
some show-off interfusion he calls his
Special. Without looking at her, with-
out faltering in his mixing, “Y’ bloody
rude Nipponese bitch,” he says. “Why
di’n’t y’ say something to m’ mate, eh?
Eh? Who d’ya bloody think you are?
Y’ know how to behave. She knows
bloody well how to behave, mate. She
knows all right.” He illustrates that
he does, too. He pours a final jigger
of Parfait Amour into the turbid
Special and, his mask of malice merely
slightly tempered by hostliness, lifts
one of the brimming pilsener glasses:
“Come an’ get it! It’s curl-a-mo, chico.
Lead in the old pencil.” As I take the
glass, he continues his hostly good
behaviour. “Not t’ worry, mate. It’s not
you she’s shitty at. A-a-ah, no no no!
Home sweet bloody home, this is. I
told y’ I’d t showya.” He has fulfilled
his obligations, and abandons me to
his Special, and returns to his sheep.
“You s-l-u-t. Y’ hate me, don’tya?
Don’tya, Don’tya, eh? Answer me, y’
scungy bitch. Answer me!”
She has been standing as she was
standing when we came in, unshakable,
unshakably in the middle of the
implausible emporium, she and her
quarter-smile of well-bred repugnance,
her dark-robed trimness, her iron-still
hair riveted around the invisible sorcery
of her mind, her half-seen hands hold-
ing nothing with the waxen dead calm
of hands in control of some monstrous
engine of destruction. Disdain sur-
rounds her like an element nothing can
fog, splinter, or melt. A future as yet
uncorked, she will, at any moment,, in
a voice pure and angular as quartz,
utter a lacerating profundity, produce
a flash of a lightning-blue sentence
which will erase Mr. Butterfry in a sprig
of smoke.
“Answer me!”
She speaks. Her lips writhe, as lips
in novelettes used to, and she speaks:
“Whatta y’ doing home here at this
hour? Get thrown outa somew’ere?”
The battle is joined. The brawl is


on. The tainted leaves explode away
from the branches. The branches snap
and shatter like the sticks of a terrible
fan.
At my time of life to be embrangled
in the who’s-afraid-of-Virginia-Woolf
improprieties of a husband and wife
savaging each other is still dismaying
and spirit-fatiguing but no longer
shocks and sickens as once it did. Too
many ex-glazed lovers and ex-glossy
couples have played typhoon and
bloody murder under my nose. Per-
haps, to be certain of double murder
without murdering, they shamelessly
require the brake and safety of a by-
stander or, at least, as exhibitionists do,
the presence of a dumbstruck audience.
Mrs. Patience and Mr. Butterfry deny
me nothing. The dirty leaves and rot-
ten branches rain down subtle mis-
chief, flagrant deceit, betrayal, double-
dealing, and malevolent chicanery.
Regarding myself as beyond shock,
I am nevertherless shocked, and it
takes a while to decide why. I am
certainly startled and fascinated when
it comes out, piecemeal, that most of
Mr. Butterfry’s misfortunes have not
been caused by his own moral or
mental debility nor by a fateful mis-
mating of Japanese stars but by a glut-
tonously ambitious Japanese mother,
the former oh-so-sweet-and-cute house-
girl bred on rice slops and pickled
radish in a penurious and primitive
village in a cleft of the hills behind
Kure. It is by her machinations that,
one by one, Mr. Butterfry’s clutch of
houses and, I learn, a motor-launch
and a racehorse have evaporated as
bribes to buy continuing prominence
for Lana and Shirley in the careers she
has chosen for them. It is easy to see
that, to herself, she appears conven-
tionally maternal: thousands of Japa-
nese parents, for example, feed ex-
aminers the heavy bribes which ensure
a son’s or daughter’s place in a uni-
versity. Her bribes will have been
indecently heavy for, although Japa-
nese in appearance, the daughters are
authentic half-breeds and, as such, so
near to untouchable that unusual lar-
gesse can have been the only means
of getting them within cooee of the
limelight let alone smack in the middle
of it. Yes, I am startled by the know-
ledge of what really happened to Mr.
Butterfry’s ill-got riches, but not
shocked.
What does shock, and so totally, so
physically, that the searing Special
laves my gullet like milk, is the
quality of Mrs. Patience’s self-defensive
shrillness, the freakishness of her
accent and verbal obscenity. If the
poster daughters, whose magnified
china smiles and multitudinous im-
mense opaque eyes glimmer all around
and above the melee, have inherited
not one perceivable scintilla of him-
self from Mr. Butterfry, not so the
wife. She has, mantis, eaten his voice
from him inflection, pitch, discor-
dancy, the lingo itself with its oaths
and mutilations. Her self-justifications
match his accusations in every de-
graded particular. Acrid and bowel-
less though they are they even have
the wheedling spirit of the con-man,
and I stand convinced that it all, to
the last and most contemptible be-
trayal, serves him right, that it is ab-
solutely just that his chickens have
come home to roost defeathered and
septic. At the same time and not
merely because I am shocked by the
lusus naturae effect of a burlesque
Australian working-man’s voice spurt-
ing from a pocket-edition foreign
woman in a tastefully dour kimono •
I feel that she, rigid and free of
warmth as a doll, is charged with power
and evil, with all the glib treachery
and rancorous lunacy of her race, and
that Mr. Butterfry is doomed, unjustly
doomed.
The mind’s cigarette-lighter flicks
up a single-flame glimpse of him as he
was, as Blue, in those Whitg Rose and
Black Market days, chipper, impertin-
ent, disarming, as cock-a-hoop as the
village idiot boy at one of his own
wretched sallies in the whiffy back-
room of the Souvenir Shoppe, lecher-
ous and unfaithful as a tomcat yet
faithful as a mongrel to his idea of
love for his housegirl, his oriental
Daisy Mae, of whom “I love the poor
little bastard, chico. Mate, I’m tellin’
ya, she’s the only bloody sheila’ll ever
get me by the short hairs.”
Let there be no doubt that it is
the fiery and filament tributaries of
the Special suddenly overrunning their
and inundating my brain, that
cause the lighter-flame expand into
a wide-screen fantasy. Despite the din
of the quarrel, the strident soundtrack,
I see the whole lurid vision. The down-
at-heel castle, Arthurian, Disneyish.
Battlements beaded with weeds. A
raven hunched on each and every
pennant pole. Pennants like old tea-
towels. Dawn cold and cheap. Far
up, in the highest turret, the faceless
King of Con-men at an embrasure,
behind the cobwebs, behind the smoke
of a gangster cigar. Far below, just
beyond the portcullis, the rabble of
mounted knights on the drawbridge,.
Knights of the Unholy Grail waiting
the J. Arthur Rank gong that will
unleash the ratbag mob on its quest
of swindling and duping: Sir Jero-
boam the Purple Knight, Sir Jocularis
the Chequered Knight, Sir Jackanapes
the Pin-striped Knight, a scruffy host
of others, spivs all, and . . . there! .. .
younger than any, freckle-peppered,
ginger-haired, retrousse, tirra-lira-ing
in a lamentable falsetto, our man
from Gippsland, Sir Juvenilis the Blue
Knight. The nags fret and caracole.
Each knight, waiting there in the bil-
ious sunrise, secretively polishes a
platitude or two, practises a snide and
hypnotising smile. Ah! the ravens stir,
hunch their shoulders, look down
their beaks the gong sounds.
They’re off! Watch the Blue Knight.
Follow Sir Juvenilis, and see him by-
pass the perils that topple the others.
The Forest Forlorn, the Hazardous
Crags, the Mere of Thin Ice, the Marsh
of False Steps. Hear him whistling
past Dungeon Grey where Giant
Wideawake has clapped Sir Jeroboam
and Sir Jackanapes. Now he gallops
down the last avenue (trees of tinsel
and fake crystal), radiant with his
rake-offs, and shining like a prince,
toward the Maiden of the Eastern
Hills. In a flash the bells are ringing,
the champagne bottles foam at the
mouth, the maiden has become his
oh-so-sweet-and-cute princess, and the
screen shudders and shimmers with
intimations of happy-ever-after.
It is a pity, it is always a pity, that
even if one is shrewd, or lucky enough
to leave in time, while the champagne
and hors-d'oeuvre are being gulped
and gutsed, that circumstances the
dropped glove, the library book left
under the seat bring one back, re-
luctant and fuming, in the middle of
another instalment, a later reel. In
this case the dropped glove can be
said to be the Shimbashi Lion Beer
Hall or, more pinpointedly, Blue saying,
in the tones of an aggrieved and de-
serted deitv, “You don’ remember me,
y’ bastard.” The later instalment, the
latest instalment, is the one in which
the Maiden from the Hills, promoted
to the princess with her surfeit of
antimacassars, and cabinets of cut-glass
salad bowls and sandwich trays, turns
out to be no more than the wicked
witch, the run-of-the-mill dangerous
dam, with her casque of iron hair, her
stranger’s mind, and the stolen voice
which quadruples her power since she
can annihilate her victim with his own
bird-of-prey accent and tricks, his own
brutal oaths.
It is time to leave again, and finally,
no dropped glove. If nothing else the
soundtrack, the who’s - afraid - of -
Virginia-Woolf discord, is too boring,
on and on and on. More boring than
anything is the truth. The truth? Mr.
Butterfry, my little mate, Blue, Gregory
R. Patience, Sir Juvenilis, foul-mouthed,
desperately yelping behind his cocktail
bar and a palisade of on-the-nose
statuettes, has really found what the
Unholy Grail contains. He has come
as far as he can, and that is that. Now
that he has, as he said he would, bloody
shown me, perhaps I can, at last, partly
agree with him: a fatigue like the
fatigue of metal has incurably affected
whatever brand of luck he may be said
to have had. There is no chance of its
reviving, and no way back for Mr.
Butterfry, no escape hatch, secret
tunnel, air-lift, exit of any kind, none,
and nothing.
It is just as well. It leaves him with
at least one dream, one Teddy Bear to
tote around, or cuddle as he ranges
the country to sell Pommy gin and
Yankee running-shoes. The Teddy
Bear dream is the retiring and settling
down one. What I had no voucher

of permit to tell him is better not told.
The dream is no longer worth dream-
ing. The Sleepy Hollow fishing village
in Gippsland, where he sees his dream
self fishing and lazing and earbashing
and shouting drinks for well-kippered
old-timers with fish scales in the salty
folds of their sweaters, has been wiped
off the board of reality. Goats and
Norfolk Island pines, sandy streets and
lad’s love hedges, crayfish pots, and
weatherboard pub, not any of these is
there. Offshore, oil-drills straddle the
former fishing grounds. The village
has become a geometric townlet of
metal and cement. The blue-stone cot-
tages, one of which he pictures himself
buying for a song, are ccntemporarised,
added to, and reverberate to the habits
and hallucinations and accents of
Americans, and cost the earth. Ferro-
concrete hostels, gardenless, glassy,
glaring, enclose the institutional male
horseplay and immigrant odors of
escapees from the neurotic and dirty
Old World, the riff-raff of degenerat-
ing civilisations.
It does not matter how I escape
the costly chaos of the living-room and
the walls papered with depthless eyes
and shallow smiles. As a ghost does
from the ignobilities of the living,
escape I do, slipping away so incon-
spicuously that the two engaged
vehemently in the drama of hatred
notice nothing. The soundtrack of their
vilifications does not falter or blur, I
close the gate of artistically deformed
branches as one closing a book never
to be opened again. The long long
street of secluding and imprisoning
walls, ill-lit, and medievally winding
in and out of a plexus of sunless other
medievally winding and ill-lit streets,
unravels before me, and instantly and
darkly ravels and reravels itself behind
me. Back there, farther and farther
back, lies the room, a gaudy and in-
ferior star caught in the meshes, en-
closed in the night just as the geisha,
meretricious, bizarre, and blinding, was
in the black leatherette cabin of her
jinricksha. Back there caught and
enclosed in the room Mr. Butterfry,
the Mr. Butterfry who must, tonight
and any night, sooner or later, flag,
run down, crack up, give in again, the
Mr. Butterfry with whom one has
shared the fascinating exhaustions of
mateship, and on whom alternately
squandered contempt and pity. Not
until I am almost out of the tangle
of suburban criss-crossings and convolu-
tions does it seem clear that the con-
tempt is useless and that, even if he has
to suffer alien constellations and out-
landish ethics, the pity is not needed at
all.
Whatever anyone thinks life is for
or about, whatever fatuous prophecies
are attributed to scientists, whatever
abnormal skills are wished upon poets,
musicians, actors, etchers, sculptors,
and others of the non-man-in-the-
street sect. Nature has not once indi-
cated that life is for or about any-
thing more than an arcane necessity
to breed, before one dies, others to
breed and live and die. The rest is
side-line, mere decoration Rem-
brandt oil-paintings, penicillin, Big
Berthas, graven images, Lanner
waltzes, top-hats, asceticism, pacifism,
fcotball-club pennants, cut-glass salad
bowls, take your pick side-line
decoration, no more. Nature’s suckers
are, in a final generalising count, left
one only wry consolation: to love
their spawn even if the spawn detest
them.
I cannot tell whether, off the posters,
Lana and Shirley Patience, mobile and
nubile, the flames of their smiles
turned down or utterly put out, love
the Mr. Butterfry whose relation to
them, in a country of racial snobbism,
makes them nearly untouchable. A
guess that they do not love him is
beside the point. Whether, in a melo-
dramatically changed form from the
Kure one (Act Sixteen, Scene Ninety),
Mr. Butterfry still loves the trans-
formed housegirl is most doubtful.
A surmise of not is also beside the
point. He has decided to bloody show
me something of why he viciously hunts
bar-creatures through the neon nights.
They are creatures of the same sex
and jungle as the one he long ago
foretold would have him by the short
hairs. Only a tithe of his excessive
despair is, in private, uselessly usable
against the combination of her alien
inscrutability and stolen accent and
vocabulary. He has, therefore, so much
to spare that a prodigality of public
venom has become inevitable.
He has, as well, either by accident
or with elemental subtlety, bloody
shown something else.
Paper smiles and eyes, bought with
other houses, remain lining the walls of
his last house. In the centre of its
bazaar-room, she, the classic dam as
much a dupe of nature as he, re-
mains, witch-neat in a sombre kimono,
black-tongued as an Australian alley
virago. He has not thrown her out.
He has thrown out no one, not even
himself. He has not torn down the
seductively grimacing posters.
If the last house must finally go so
that there is no wall at all on which to
tack the extra posters the house has
been bartered for, his condition of im-
prisonment would not alter. A beat-up
Sir Juvenilis, an aging terrier of a spiv
snarling and sniffing in the daily darker
corners of the prison, he is not to bf'
pitied, neither for losing his Black
Market riches nor the fishing village
which no longer exists.
How else than by pretending to hate
such showy losses can Mr. Butterfry
really and truly con himself as con-
men. such as he must finally do—into
accepting that he hates his guilt, and
deeply loves his daughters, all smiles,
safe for a year more, a week more, a
moment-before-the-deluge more, on and
behind their gaudy paper posters?


BOOKS
History’s most reported war
By ROBERT O'NEILL
Australians in Vietnam. lan Mackay.
Rigby. $3.75.
Bleeding Earth: A Doctor Looks at
Vietnam. Alister Brass. Heinemann.
$4.95.
BOTH OF THESE books report a
wide range of events in Vietnam which
are of interest to Australians, and both
are by professional journalists. Alister
Brass, a qualified medical practitioner,
writes about his series of helicopter-stop
visits to medical teams dotted about
Vietnam in early 1967. lan Mackay
describes briefly and readably the major
Australian activities in Vietnam, con-
centrating on the years 1965 to 1967
and covering the three Services, the
medical teams, and the civilians who
are assisting the Vietnamese.
Despite its being the most reported
war in history, very few of the press-
men who have visited Vietnam have
either prepared themselves sufficiently
beforehand or stayed long enough to
understand the situation. Perhaps this
is a measure of an undiscerning public
hunger for knowledge about the war,
but men like Denis Warner and
Francois Sully have shown what can be
done in the way of interpretative re-
porting in depth. Mackay and Brass
have made no claim to give interpreta-
tive accounts so it is not fair to criticise
them for not doing what they had no
intention of doing, but it is worth
noting that both these accounts are
pictures of the surface of events and
they have avoided tackling the reason-
ing and the planning behind the events
which they describe.
Mackay does make some pretensions
of having prepared himself to under-
stand Vietnamese politics by including
a chapter on the growth of the Com-
muiiist movement there. This chapter
includes eight major errors, and one
wonders why he wrote it if he was not
fared at least to acquaint himself
* the normal source material avail-
such as Hoang Van Chi, But-
and Warner.
The. idea of the Vietnam Quoc Dan
Dang finking with the Indo-China Com-
munist Party is as ludicrous as the DLP
joining the Australian Communist
Party. Ho Chi Minh left Moscow in
1939, not 1941. The Japanese entered
Indo-China in September, 1940, not
December, 1941. The Viet Minh
avoided attacking the Japanese until
the close of the war. The Vietnam
Liberation Army was formed on Decern-
Ian Mackay . . . larded with errors
ber 22, 1944, not August 7, 1945. The
March, 1946, agreement was reached
between Ho and Commissioner
Sainteny, not with France, whose poli-
cies were very different from those of
Sainteny. The Franco-Viet Minh war
began with the deaths of over 6000
Vietnamese through the French naval
bombardment of Haiphong in Novem-
ber, 1946, not with a Viet Minh attack
on the French in Hanoi in December.
The chapters on the work of the
Task Force are so larded with errors
that it is obvious that Mackay has got
some garbled second-hand version which
he is now publishing under the veil
of truth. One serious methodological
error he makes is to. omit reference to
which events he actually did see and
which he wrote up from public-relations
handouts in Australia. Would it have
been too embarrassing in view of the
claims of the blurb, “Here, at last, is the
true story of how it feels to be an
Australian fighting or working in Viet-
nam,” for Mackay to have said exactly
when he was in Vietnam? As far as
I know McKay has never visited Nui
Dat.
Private Noack was a member of B
Company (in view of the possible clash
between A and B Companies this is
vital). The main purpose of Operation
Hardihood was to clear a Viet Cong
battalion off Nui Dat, not to give the
men a look at the country. 12 Platoon
of D Company 6 RAR will not like
being omitted from the battle of Long
Tan in which they played a crucial
role. APCs are fully tracked vehicles,
not with steerable wheels on the front
and tracks behind, as Mackay suggests
this is apparent from one of his own
photographs. No 70mm. Japanese-made
Alister Brass ... interesting facts
gun was captured after the battle of
Long Tan nor was any other artil-
lery piece apart from mortars.
Operation Crowsnest was aimed at
274 Regiment near Ngai Giao in
October, 1966, not at 275 Regiment
east (not north) of Nui Dat in August,
and the diggers kept their packs on. I
only wish that I could have taken
mine off, but we were advancing all
the time and could not go back to
pick up anything we had taken off. A,
B, and Support Companies 5 RAR
will raise their eyebrows at being left
out of Operation Canberra, west of the
“Din Dinh” hills, wherever they might
be. Despite Mackay’s claims of no
substantial contact on this operation,
three of our platoon commanders won
military crosses, a stretcher bearer won
the military medal; and a section com-
mander was mentioned in dispatches
(posthumously).
Operation Caloundra is described as
if we had never cordoned Binh Ba
before. The photograph of “5 RAR”
landing at Vung Tau is actually of 103
Signals Squadron, as can be seen from
the hat badges and light-colored packs
(5 RAR had specially dyed dark
packs.) Xuyen Moc, “another nearby
village,” was actually the most remote
in the province from Nui Dat and Ba
Ria, as a glance at a map of Phuoc
Tuy will show. “Every village of any
size had its orphanages, one if not
two, run usually by Roman Catholic
nuns.” No village in Phuoc Tuy has
an orphanage and there are no nuns
outside of Ba Ria. If Mackay had
ever seen the Dat Do fence (or
examined the photograph he publishes)
he would see that it is of square cross-
section, not pyramid shaped. One
could go on and on with this sort

of catologue of errors. Enough is
enough.
Alister Brass has been much wiser
in sticking to what he actually saw, and
in concentrating on those matters
which his training equips him for. This
•has produced a book with a pre-
dominantly medical content, but be-
cause this is such an important aspect
of the war we are in Dr. Brass’ debt
for his account. He has a remarkable
capacity for recollection and his
rendering of detail permits the reader
to be the judge. Certainly the reader
can only use the material which Brass
has selected, but I cannot detect dis-
tortions or omissions in the way in
which he has gene about his choice.
Some of his descriptive sentences are
superb for what they portray in a few
words. To read his passages about
Saigon and provincial hospitals is to
feel the environment as it actually is.
His subtle references tu the motivations
of people active in Vietnam are
extremely interesting, covering the full
range from dedication to exploitation,
In all shades from naivety to sophistica-
tion.
Generally Brass keeps his personal
views out of his book, but he reveals
himself a little when recounting how
he asked a young American lieutenant
which side was winning the war. The
young American mistook this question,
really a ploy to ridicule him faintly, for
a genuine request for an opinion. The
next journalist to put this question to
the young officer might be answered
with “Do you mind?” Here and there
are a few small mistakes, such as con-
fusing a cordon and search for a Med-
cap and implying that Australian
vehicles drive along Route 15 from
Vung Tau to Saigon. These are only
incidentals among a mass of inter-
esting facts and impressions which have
been skilfully marshalled and put
together.
Fishy whiffs
By MARIA WOLKOWSKY
Jean Cocteau: The Man and the
Mirror. Elizabeth Sprigge & Jean-
Jacques Kihm. Gollancz. $6.25.
BOOKS ABOUT Jean Cocteau always
seem to turn out to be books about
other people. There are the same fas-
cinating glimpses of the high-camp
circles in which he moved, illustrious
names are scattered about as freely
as stars in the Paris firmament (Proust,
Picasso, Stravinsky, Colette, Diaghilev,
Coco Chanel), there are lists of his
prodigious output, his films and plays,
novels and verses, stage-designs, draw-
ings, tapestries, masks, ballets, and
chapel murals, tidly and chronogically
catalogued the when and the where,
if not the why all of it immensely
diverting but ultimately adding noth-
ing new or significant about Cocteau.
After this latest cross-Channel attempt
at biography retold, one begins to
suspect that it is because there is noth-
ing new or significant to add about
Cocteau, and perhaps just in that lies
his significance.
Possibly he was not so much a
personality in his own right as a reflec-
tion of his times, the upper boheme
first half of this century, lending them
greater intensity just by being there.
Not so much the man “and” the mir-
ror of the subtitle, as the man “is”
the mirror. Through him, flushed with
success, his beloved “sacred monsters”
could at any moment see themselves
and their own world, retouched and
recolored, flatteringly projected back
again. After all, it does seem relevant
that one of Cocteau’s biggest and life-
long artistic obsessions was with
mirrors, real ones, trick ones, sheets
of water, or empty frames through
which his actors stepped like Alice
Through the Looking Glass, and with
its twin-theme of andrpgynous, two-of-
a-kind, brother-sister relationships.
These run through much of his work
like compulsive variations on a real
fixation.
Much of this biography is often
annoyingly chatty in places, and has a
habit of neatly skirting any of the
Cocteau. .. shadow without the man
important question marks that may
still surround Cocteau’s diffuse and
butterfly talent. One would have liked
fewer red-herrings drawn across the
old trail of Cocteau’s still-obscure
record with the Nazis. This would have
been the place for a final showdown,
was he or was he not a collaborator,
as he has so often been accused? The
strongly fishy whiffs that one catches
here and there only serve to make one
unduly suspicious. It is difficult to
believe in any real ideological convic-
tion on his part, although a touch of
expedient artistic fence-sitting would
not have been altogether out of
character.
At least these days, when sexual
deviants are officially held to exist and
drugs are daily news, a biography can
be fairly frank both about Cocteau’s


opium-taking and his succession of
“Monsieur Bebes.” Some, like author
Raymond Radiguet, were too fond of
the bottle and died at 20, and all of
them were “reincarnations” of young
Dargelos, a fellow-pupil whose name
no one would otherwise remember. His
long friendship with actor Jean Marais
(“The Beast” in Cocteau’s film) is not
played down, nor are his unfortunate
experiences with Maurice Sachs, whose
death is, however, given in a rather
different version from that in Violette
Leduc’s autobiography, nor is his love-
hate feud with the surrealists, or his
on-again, off-again excursions with the
wealthy Francine Weisweiller. But there
are some odd distortions: “I saved
Genet,” the authors quote from Coc-
teau’s own “La Difficulte d’Etre,” as
if Sartre and Cide were mere hangers-
on in getting this genuine genius
released from a French criminal prison.
Cocteau does seem to have been at
his best when adapting other people’s
ideas, and seems likely to live longest,
through some of his films and perhaps
his libretto for Stravinsky’s “Oedipus
Rex.” But it is hard to forgive him
his lack of professional integrity in
designing the sets for “Pelleas and
Melisande,” although he was perfectly
aware that his linear style would not
suit the mystic atmosphere of the
opera at all, simply because he could
not resist having his name linked for
all time with that of Debussy.
For anyone who has not read a book
on Cocteau before, this could be an
entertaining, name-dropping introduc-
tion; those who have may find it both
infuriating and frustrating. However,
the joint biographers can be forgiven
their gushing style and much of their
own rehashing and surface-skimming
for one sentence that might best serve
as Cocteau’s epitaph: “Having some-
times, through the strange alchemy of
his work, seemed like a man without
a shadow, now, in the mirror slightly
tarnished with age, he was becoming
the shadow without the man.”
LEARNING TO FALL
In the unsightly judo garb
That nevertheless adorns
His noble body, the instructor
Bows to me, I bow.
We walk toward each other
On straddled legs,
Faces hiding behind a face;.
His bare chest golden as the mats.
He takes the loose lapel
Of my belted jacket
And seems to finger the rough cloth
Meditatively, as if testing the quality.
Then takes the other in easy fist,
And as I sickle his ankles with hook-foot
The room reels. I swim in his arms,
And from his flexed flank fall like
Adam.

Australia's "tax effort"
My attention has been drawn to an
article entitled “Taxation Below Capa-
city” (8., March 16). This article
implied that calculations made by the
International Monetary Fund indicate
that Australians are relatively lightly
taxed and could “obviously” bear
higher taxes.
These calculations appeared in a
paper entitled “Measuring ‘Tax Effort’
in Developing Countries,” written by
two economists on the staff of the
International Monetary Fund. The
article failed to mention, however, many
facts bearing closely on the meaning
and significance of the figures. In par-
ticular—
(a) The paper, which was not an
official IMF document but one pub-
lished under their own names by the
authors, gave the results of exploratory
research work by them on certain
limited aspects of the problems involved
in making inter-country comparisons
of taxable capacity and “tax effort.”
The authors went to some length to
make it clear that their calculations
did not take account of a variety of
factors, both economic and non-
economic, which could be important in
evaluating the taxable capacity and tax
effort of particular countries.
(b) Apart from that, the authors
noted that their calculations, which
related to a span of past years, would
not reveal the present relative situation
in the case of countries which had in-
creased as Australia has or
decreased their taxation relative to
Gross National Product.
(c) Three sets of calculations of rela-
tive taxation effort were given in the
paper, but The Bulletin article drew
figures for Australia only from two. It
did not mention that the other calcula-
tion put Australia relatively high
in 16th place in the list.
(d) Referring to the methods used
to make the two sets of calculations
from which the figures for Australia
quoted in The Bulletin article were
taken, the authors of the paper summed
up their very limited usefulness as
follows: “In short, apparently neither
of our techniques of estimation is
much assistance in measuring the
taxable capacity of high-income coun-
tries.”" Australia is, of course, one of
the high-income countries.
(e) The authors further emphasised
that “a low or high ranking in tax
effort (on their calculations) did not
imply that taxes should be increased or
decreased. An informed opinion on
that question,” they said, “should take
into consideration economic conditions,
the character and level of Government
expenditures, administrative capacity,
and a variety of other factors.”
In short, the paper, by the two mem-
bers of the IMF staff, provides no basis
for the proposition that, by comparison
with other countries, Australia could
obviously bear higher taxes. It does,
however, point to some of the reasons
why facile judgments in this field
should be avoided.

Backing away from Britain
As an Englishman visiting Australia
I found your article (8., March 2),
some cf your recent comments on
British withdrawal East of Suez, and
the tone of Prime Minister Gorton’s
pleas that Australia is a small nation
and thus cannot have an independent
foreign policy interesting evidence of
the, to me, thoroughly surprising lack
of a sense of national independence and
even national self-respect in Australia.
Were Australia an individual, a psy-
chiatrist reviewing her neurosis by
psychotherapy would undoubtedly in-
sist on some positive and absolute step
being taken to express identity and
create a mature sense of self-confidence.
For the Commonwealth of Australia
that step is surely declaration of
national identity by becoming a re-
public, perhaps not with a president
and all the American trappings, but re-
taining the present structure with a
prominent Australian appointed Gov-
ernor-General as the Australian Head
of State and Australia responsible tn
Australia and Australia alone. And
when this step is taken, I hope Aus-
tralia, for her own psychiatric good, will
become a republic by proclamation of
the Parliament of Australia, without
any reference to special Acts of the
Parliament at Westminster formally re-
pealing the last legal links of colonial
status.
Alan Creed
Subiaco, W.A.
As a nation, we have fought with, de-
fended, and been defended by Britain
at various intervals in two major con-
flicts and several lesser ones.
Our legal procedures and traditions
are modelled closely upon Britain’s, as
is our political system. More tangibly,
our social customs are linked insepar-
ably with hers; after all, who brought
us to eat in a civilised manner, to speak
in a refined voice, as well to honor, as
a nation, an international sovereign?
I am proud to be an “Aussie” and
wish to see Australia prosperous and
secure. I also remember what this
splotch of land was less than 200 years
ago, and I am proud to be British!
