LONDON AS QUEEN VICTORIA KNEW THE HEART OF EMPIRE.
THE “KING'S HEAD.” CHIGWELL.
r jpHE “King’s Head,” named after the signboard on which a
portrait of Charles I, needs no description to those familiar
with Charles Dickens’ “Barnaby Rudge.” Under the name of the
“Maypole,” Dickens has described this inn for all time with that
wonderful detail of which he was a genius The large room on
the first floor is “John Chester’s Chamber.” This picturesque inn,
with its gables, projecting storeys, wood and plaster front and
lattice windows, all of which bore witness to its antiquity, dated
from the time of the Stuarts. The old ehurch of St. Mary stood
opposite the King’s Head Inn in this village, which Dickens,
writing to John Forster, described as “the greatest place in the
world.”

A CRITIC OF SHAKSPEARE.
Professor W. A. Osborne, of Mel-
bourne, who seems to know the
world’s literature from Homer to Shak-
speare, from Dante to Goethe, in its
original tongues and in such minute
detail that he could tell when a comma
was misplaced, fixes on the arts a pecu-
liarly alarming eye
The first essay in his Essays and
Studies (Lothian) is entitled “Scientific
Errors in Literature and Art” and, of
course, the men of letters are caught out
in some frightful crimes; Hogg and
Coleridge put the moon in the wrong
place, Rider Haggard had an eclipse of
the sun lasting over an hour “whereas
the maximum time is seven minutes” and
Walter Scott, arousing the scholar to two
exclamation marks, described a sunset
in the east. Even if one suspects that
Professor Osborne is in error in his
criticism of Wordsworth’s “Fair as a star
when only one Is shining in the sky” —
surely Wordsworth was referring to the
evening star, which does seem to glitter
with a large and lovely clarity before the
other stars appear—one is really afraid
to argue the point with conviction; for
perhaps they don’t see the evening star
in England, or perhaps, scientifically
speaking, there is no such star.
When, however. Professor Osborne
remarks on the rarity of geographical
place-names in Shakspeare, pointing
out that Marlowe (and after him,
of course, Milton) made much play with
them, and quoting from “Tamburlaine the
Great”;
Then marched I into Egypt and Arabia,
And here, not far from Alexandria,
Where the Terrene and the Red Sea meet
I meant to cut a channel to them both,
That men might quickly sail to India.
From thence to Nubia near Borno lake,
And so along the /Ethiopian sea.
Cutting the Tropic line of Capricorn,
I conquered all as far as Zanzibar—
it is not enough then to declare “All
we can say is that this music did not
appeal to Shakspeare and so it is absent.”
Shakspeare was not merely indifferent to
this sort of music ; in some of Pistol’s
speeches he went out of his way to cari-
cature it; he despised it. Why? Surely
because he thought it cheap and easy;
anybody could make up a resounding
list of place-names—as, possibly with a
postal directory in their hands, so many
of the American poets do today. It’s a
device of cheap romanticism, essentially
requiring no more ingenuity than a travel
poster, and the music arising from it is
rhetoric rather than poetry; rococo, an
ornamental gilding of the stones of
poetry rather than the mysterious infusing
of them with light and warmth that was
the special quality of Shakspeare ? s genius.
Shakspeare was not “unresponsive” to
this music ; he was superior to it.
Professor Osborne’s notes and essays—
they are on all sorts of literary and scien-
tific subjects, and there are some of those
reconstructions of past times which he
does marvellously well—are, of course,
delightful. Since it is the special province
of the universities to preserve the litera-
ture of the past, and to correct error.
Essays and Studies is exactly the sort of
book that should be written in this
country ; and it is a pleasure to think
that there are a publisher and a public
for it. How illuminating it is to learn,
for instance, that the folio reading of
There are more things in Heaven and earth,
Horatio/
Than are dreamt of in your philosophy
is “in our philosophy” ; which, as Pro-
fessor Osborne points out, vastly improves
the lines by changing a personal sarcasm
into a universal reflection. And how
delightful it is to see, unearthed in the
“Scientific Errors” essay from Southey’s
“Botany Bay Eclogues”;
When for lowing herds
And for the music of the bleating flocks
Alone is heard the kangaroo’s sad note
Deepening in distance
It is a pleasure to read the book; and
a pleasure to disagree with it. As again
one must when Professor Osborne re-
proaches Shakspeare with “a poor re-
sponse” to the “great world drama” of
the discovery of America:
The truth is that Shakspeare as a
romantic was more interested in the Italy,
Greece and England of the past than in the
expanding world of his day.
This is almost the harrowing Leftist
illusion that all art which does not deal
with workers going on strike is “romantic”
or “not concerned with present-day
realities.” Professor Osborne even says
that the defeat of the Armada “influenced
Shakspeare’s art not at all.” But where
else—where else in the name of the Nine
Muses —did Shakspeare get the feeling,
the passion, the incentive for the great
patriotic speeches of, say, “Henry the
Fifth”? Where did the mood, the
fantasy, the adventurousness of “The
Tempest” come from if not from the dis-
covery of America and all the great voy-
ages of the day? Who else was Cleo-
patra but Mary Fitton?
Shakspeare’s dramas spring directly
from the life of his own time ; the love
that he knew, the hate, the fighting, the
ribaldry, the country tranquillity, the
voyages of the adventurers ; an age of
passion and excitement reflected in a
passionate and exciting poetry. Professor
Osborne misapprehends Shakspeare in the
way that many Australian critics mis-
understand Hugh McCrae, observing that
McCrae had “fat young nymphs” spring-
ing about him while Paterson was writing
about horses but failing to perceive that
both were expressing the vigor, the free-
dom and the gaiety of the Australian life
of their period. Shakspeare was not pri-
marily a historian obsessed by the past,
but a playwright concerned with living
realities; which, being a poet, he ex-
pressed in parable and symbol.
It was not that a “romantic appeal”
lay in historical events, but that truth
lay there. Contemporary plays of great
historical events are almost inevitably
propaganda plays; so much passion, so
much prejudice, so much lying surrounds
human activity, especially the political
and national events suitable for poetic
drama. The best way to tell the truth
about Elizabethan England was to tell the
truth about Macbeth, or Antony, or
Caesar. For in the events of the past,
about which he was free to write as he
liked, and the inner truth of which had
been sifted by time, Shakspeare could find
characters for his dramas who —because
human nature is eternally the same—
were at once Romans and Elizabethans,
living men from past times and embodi-
ments of the excitement of his own. T. S.
Eliot has never written a play about
Hitler or the atom bomb ; but one would
not say, after Murder in the Cathedral,
which deals with the prevalence of mar-
tyrdom, that he was “curiously unrespon-
sive” to the events of the twentieth cen-
tury.
The Ways of the Crocodile.
There does not seem to be much ex-
cuse for the crocodile. It has too large
a mouth, and far too many teeth ; it is a
cannibal; and it behaves generally in a
lurking, slithering, menacing and alto-
gether unpleasant manner. But there is
every excuse for lon Idriess’s In Croco-
dile Land (Angus and Robertson), for it’s
a fascinating story of adventure in the
far north.
Interspersing his yarns of crocodile
hunts with facts about the behavior of
the creatures, Mr. Idriess manages
to win a certain amount of sympathy for
them. Even a crocodile, it appears, has
a mother. And after a charming court-
ship in moonlit waters, during which her
mate coughs, bellows and playfully bites
her and she, responding, deals him
gigantic buffets with her tail, the maternal
crocodile seeks a lonely place, far away
from her cannibalistic spouse, and there
makes her nest;
Down on to the little sandpat'ch beats
the warm sun from the blue sky above.
A deathlike quietness is all around. Dis-
tantly comes a low murmur —the lazy sea.
She becomes busy. Her paws make the
sand fly as she scrapes out a hole, but not
a deep one. When this is to her satisfac-
tion she hurries out from the hole and her
paws root up the grass tufts, scratch to-
gether the leaves. She scrapes these into
the hole and thus roughly lines it with
vegetation.
When the devoted parent has laid from
40 to 60 eggs—sometimes 80 —she scrapes
up more leaves and grass tufts (“It is
really marvellous how lithe her great
bulk can be”), pushes them to the nest
and over the eggs with a sweep of her
tail, then covers the lot with sand, making
a mound three feet high. At which point
one might imagine that a crocodile
would' feel she had done enough for
posterity. But Mr. Idriess says she
“hangs around” for 15 to 17 days while
the eggs are hatching, and then, after the
young have wriggled their way to the
light and made their way instinctively to
the water, she is waiting to greet them:
As the baby crocodile scurries to the
water’s edge he sees mother silently wait-
ing there, camouflaged by the shadows of
the trees. He may see beauty in the hide-
ous jowls of his mother, in her greenish,
slanting, coldly watchful eyes. I doubt it,
though. 1 think the vicious little pest
merely feels instinctively that all is well.
Somehow he knows that he must wait —
for his brothers and sisters. And so time
dreams on until the whole family is there
—except the old man. He is not wanted.
In fact, about the last thing on earth they
wish to see is their father She takes
them only a little way, through shallow
water where her huge bulk will scare away
large fish, to a secluded sandbank just out
in the stream. The mother for 10 days or
so will protect them from any prowling
crocodile.
However idyllic this picture may be
there is something alarming in the notion
of crocodiles being bred 40, 60 or 80 at
a time; but the same notion must have
occurred to Nature, for the eggs are
thoughtfully eaten by aboriginals and
their dogs, wild pigs and the impudent
gaanna ; and the young crocodiles—a
few inches long when they first take to
the water —are devoured by sharks and
other large fish, sea eagles, their father
and, once again, the aboriginals,
Mr. Idriess does not say at what date
he went hunting crocodiles, but it was
apparently a good many years before the
war. However, the book is very fresh and
lively, the sort of thing he always does
well. It is given continuity by the story
of a cruise in search of crocodiles—the
skins being then marketable—aboard a
vessel named the Lotus, and there is
much colorful information about birds,
buffaloes and blackfellows.
MICHAEL.
“Come in from the verandah and the
blaze
Of the midday sea. Sit by me in my
room.
Leave the binoculars on the bracket there
Where I can find them in a moment. All
day
There’s use for them —driftwood half-
submerged
And dunnage no more than a captive
flash
Of the sun, three miles downstream —a
ship to name.”
So we went in, over the ropecoil mats
And bleached clamshells that fastened
back the door.
“Vve stolen from the sea to trim my
room —
This fluted shell I call the Rising Sun,
Veined with the crimson of a parrot’s
wing. ,
My son (now overseas ) has often said
On such a boat the seaborn Venus hove
To her earthly mooring with a freight of
love.
{Today, I fear, that cargo wouldn’t sink
The painted shell you chalice in your
hands)
“This green, encrusted brass came from
the wreck
Of the Prince Regent out on South Trees
bank
That Flinders named. I had a few such
spikes,
But gave them to the shipwright of the
town
To send to sea again. And this white
weed’s
From Heron Island reef; no more than
a ghost
Of its beauty; but, waving in the warm
tides there.
It snares the sunlight fathoms deep, to
drown.
A.I.F.
“The sea has raised its pyramids of pearl,
So beautiful that all the towers of men
Seem but misshapen piles of stone, when
eyes
Behold the white breasts of the trochus
shell.
“See, too, this catfish, bearing in its head
Christ crucified. Note how His hands are
stretched.
I wonder, in His days by Galilee
He knew these fish that shared His secret
with Him ?
“Stingaree spines; and here, a sawfish bill.
Not common in these waters. I fought
three hours
To bring that one ashore.”
So Michael spoke.
Translating sea-things to my earth-tuned
ears.
Till the green light, crested with sunlit
panes.
Was the depth of a quiet sea, where each
•mummied thing.
Bewitched, knew life once more, in the
tide of his voice ;
And ships sailed on that rotted fathoms
down
These thirty years, and he was young
again,
Drawing in hauls that mocked the night
of stars.
Bending his oars against the eddying tide,
Hoisting defiant canvas to the gales;
A man in all things equal of the sea.
I left him then. There seemed no place
for me
In the room where the old man strove
to keep immured.
Beyond the grasp of Time, his youth; the
gift
That he, in love, had rendered to the sea,
And in these baubles thought he had re-
claimed.
VAL VALLIS.
For Children.
John Dailey’s The Gift of a Child
(Dent) is a handbook for parents, also
“aunties and uncles” and anyone else
afflicted by the very young. There are
discussions on the child mind, theories
on upbringing and so on, with the object
of helping parents to understand the
child’s personality. Problems of this sort
are discussed:
John is bringing in a scuttle of coal.
“Open the door, Jimmy.”
“No.”
“Come on; open the door for daddy.”
“No.”
He stands up against the door and looks
serious. What are you going to do?
The present commentator, speaking
from a vast inexperience, would (a) kill
Jimmy ; ( b ) call a policeman ;or (c) send
for Mr. Dailey.
It might also be possible to lure Jimmy
away from the door by promising him
(a) hell ;-(b) a penny ; (c) a reading from
Leslie Rees’s Digit Dick and the Tas-
manian Devil (John Sands, Ltd.), Leila
Pirani’s The Old Man River of Aus-
tralia (Sands) or Judy Brown’s and Mirrie
Hill’s Kindergarten Songs (Currawong).
Mr. Rees’s young hopeful, last encoun-
tered at the Barrier Reef, is looking for
a Tasmanian Devil in the present volume
and meets en route a lively assortment of
Tasmanian fauna, including a ringtailed
possum, a Professor Bat, and a reincarna-
tion of the last of the aborigines. Leila
Pirani tells in a simple first-person narra-
tive the story of the River Murray; and
the Kindergarten Songs —with music—are
concerned with bats, kookaburras, flannel
flowers, etc. If Jimmy can be talked
into singing
I am a flannel-flower
With petals soft and white
that will obviously be much better than
hitting him on the head with the poker.
At least, much kinder.
The Australian Accent.
The chief value of A. G. Mitchell’s
The Pronunciation of English in Aus-
tralia (Angus and Robertson) is as a
corrective to loose thinking on the sub-
ject. Mr. Mitchell, who is a lecturer in
English at Sydney University, is an
acknowledged expert on phonetics.
We are not to assume that there is a
single correct standard way of speaking
English and that all other ways are cor-
rupt or degenerate... .We are entitled to say
only that there exist many different forms
of English pronunciation, national, dia-
lectal, social. All are good and useful
Among the many forms of English pronun-
ciation the ways of speaking English in Aus-
tralia take their place....We should speak
of differences rather than corruption, of
characteristics rather than faults.
Australian pronunciation has de-
veloped through a combination of social,
psychological, acoustic, physiological and
other influences Comparison of Eng-
lish with Australian speech should be just.
It is not just or scientific to compare the
speech of the Australian workman with
that of the cultured Englishman and to
regard the pronunciation of each as typical
of their countries. We should compare
the speech of the Australian workman with
that of the English workman that of the
cultured Australian with that of the cul-
tured Englishman.
Mr. Mitchell divides Australian pro-
nunciation into two categories—Educated
Australian and Broad Australian —admit-
ting, of course, that the two overlap and
intermingle. He points out that there is
no upper-class and lower-class variation
of speech ; “Educated Australian may be
heard at the work bench. Broad Aus-
tralian in the cabinet room”; the “slow
rhythm,” however, is “more common in
country districts than in the cities.”
In its almost complete detachment the
book is a typically academic product.
Mr. Mitchell is not concerned with setting
standards (“All are good and useful”)
but with observing facts. And here
schoolteachers and others should find him
invaluable. Examining, for instance, the
allegation that Australians “speak
Cockney” he declares, in delightful
phrases, “The Cockney use of the glottal
stop and of affricated plosive consonants
is not heard in Australia.” Which should
put a glottal stop to that sort of nonsense.
For schoolteachers there should be
practical value in the chapters in which
Mr. Mitchell goes into detailed phonetic
analysis, demonstrating, in particular,
that Educated Australian pronunciation
very often calls for different symbols
from those used for transcribing Southern
English. These chapters, however,
though anyone could read them witt
profit, make the book somewhat formid-
able for the ordinary reader. The ex-
tracts from Kylie Tennant’s The Battlers
and Robert Fitz Gerald’s Moonlight Acre
look truly alarming in phonetic script.

Information Sought.
Whereabouts in London is Grub-street, and
how did the name become associated with strug-
gling writers?
Grub-street, now called Mil ton-street in honor
of the poet, whose home was near it, was famous
in the seventeenth century for the reason given
in Dr. Johnson’s definition in his Dictionary.
“Originally the name of a street near Moon-
fields in London, much inhabited by writers
of small histories, dictionaries and temporary
poems, whence any mean production is called
Grub-street.” This name has also been applied
since this time as a collective term to struggling
hack writers.
What was the history of Pigott the forger?
Richard Pigott was a journalist who supplied
the London “Times” with forged documents,
which were guilelessly used as tne basis of the
articles on “Parnellism and Crime” in 1887.
The Parnell Committee was appointed to in-
vestigate the matter, and the forgeries were ex-
posed. Pigott fled to Madrid, where he shot
himself to escape arrest.
Particulars concerning Roger Tichborne,
whom Arthur Orton impersonated ?
He was Roger Charles Doughty Tichborne.
Born in 1829 and educated at St'onyhurst, he
held for three years a commission in the Sixth
Dragoon Guards, but sold out in 1852 and
went to South America. He was last heard of
in 1854 when he embarked at Rio de Janeiro
in the ship Bella. The finding of wreckage from
this ship was taken as conclusive evidence that
she had foundered, and in 1855 his younger
brother succeeded to the family estates. His
mother believed that Roger was still alive, and
repeatedly advertised in British and colonial
newspapers for news of him. It was one of
these advertisements that prompted Orton to
make his false claim.
Who was “Carey the informer” ?
James Carey, a Dubliner, who became a
member of the Fenian conspiracy, and one of
the originators of the Invincibles. He took part
in the murder of Lord Cavendish and Thomas
Burke on May 6, 1882, and turned Queen’s
evidence. He was murdered soon afterwards on
board ship near the Cape by Patrick O’Donnell.
Medically, what is the funnybone?
The funnybone is the popular name for that
part of the elbow where the ulnar nerve passes
down the inner condyle of the humerus. The
nerve being comparatively unprotected, a blow
on this point will cause a tingling, prickling
sensation down the whole length of the nerve
to the ulnar side of the hand, followed by
numbness.
(1) What is the average buttermilk and butter-
fat production per cow in Australia? (2) What
is the highest milk-producing cow in Aus-
tralia ? (3) What is the highest butt erf at-pro-
ducing cow in Australia ?
(1) 1938-39, 370 gallons; 1939-40, 390; 1940-
41, 367; 1941-42, 340; 1942-43, 350. The
average butterfat production is not' known, but
it could be taken as 4 p.c. of the milk. (2)
Melba XV of Darbalara, an Australian milk-
ing shorthorn, produced 32,522.51 b. milk in 365
days in 1923-24. (3) Melba XV of Darbalara
produced 16141 b. of butterfat in 365 days.
What are the characteristics of the elephant
fish ?
It is a “ghost shark” of the order Holo-
cephali, characterised by a structure on the
snout which somewhat resembles a short trunk.
It is found in Vic. and Tas. waters, and is
plentiful around New Zealand, where two tons
have been taken in a single haul of trawl net.
Though not popular the flesh is quite palatable.
How to grow the Kentia palm from seed in
a Sydney garden?
Good seed can be procured from the Lord
Howe Island Board of N.S.W. Sow
as soon as received 2in. deep in light sandy soil,
well drained, in a bushhouse or under a ti-
tree covered roof. When seedlings are 4in. high
transplant into nursery rows 4in. apart in Che
rows and 12in. between the rows. See that the
plants never suffer for want of water or from
scale insects. When 6in. to 9in. high, transfer
into 4in. pots and into larger pot's as they grow.
Brief Answers.
W.W.L.: Cannot find any information about
the artists you list... .M.M.: Schools that
coach candidates for Certificates of Competency
as masters and deck officers in the merchant
navy are Captain F. Bayldon. the Nautical
Academy, Royal Exchange Building, Piti-street,
Sydney, and the Richmond Nautical School, 23
Macquarie-place, Sydney. The principals of
these can supply information about correspon-
dence courses... .M.F.: There is no George IV
spade guinea; gold coins of that period were
double sovereigns, sovereigns and half-sove-

W here versatility is required, either in the industrial field or on the farm, these ARMCO pre-
fabricated steel buildings are unique. Designed for use as machinery sheds, shearing sheds and
any other use for which a fire, weather and vermin proof structure is essential, they will solve
a host of urgent problems. Ease of erection by unskilled labour from the simplified erection
details provided and the fact that the buildings may be just as easily dismantled and re-erected
on a new site make them a sound investment for any farm or industry.

No. 40/ "T he Cookabundy Chronicles”
By BRIAN JAMES
WHEN, by a happy chance, Mr.
Foster the schoolteacher at the
Grey Box fell down a shaft and
broke both his legs, there was a
little hypocritical sympathy and much
sincere rejoicing among the small fry
along the Codkabundy. The Department
of Education stayed its hand for one
glorious but far too brief fortnight, then
sent along a relieving teacher.
His name was Ham—Eugene Ham. He
was young, enthusiastic, unmarried, and
wore a straw hat with an extraordinarily
narrow brim. He had an enormous head
—very bumpy at the back; hair of no
describable shade of cream, clipped short
all over; white eyebrows; a mouth that
wouldn’t shut properly anywhere, and a
pair of blue eyes that were eternally lit
up in surprise. ' He had no shoulders
worth noticing—he just tapered off like
a Pilsener bottle till he came to that
enormous head. He was about six-feet
high, though the tapering effect made
him look seven at least. In addition to
all these things he had a lisp.
The chiklren found him good to look
upon, and forgot their grievance over the
curtailment of their holiday. And not in
appearance only did he find favor; in
methods he was refreshing, and in sim-
plicity a pure delight.
He introduced himself: “Good morn-
ing, boyth and girlth. I’m Ham, Eugene
Ham, Eugene Thethil Ham, Mithter
Ham.” The children were gladdened to
hear it, and wondered somewhat where
the Department had stored such a treas-
ure, and why they hadn’t known of him
before. As the result of an early spelling
lesson in which he had some difficulty
with the word “thistle” he was nicknamed
“Thithle.”
There was such an enthusiasm, such a
vim in all he did, such a desire to make
interesting and visual all he told them —
with the additional treasure of his lisp—
that his treatment of Scripture made that
often dry subject a new world indeed,
and something to be entirely dissociated
from the boring dissertations so many
of them knew and dreaded in sermons
and Sunday-school. His presentation of
the story of Adam and Eve was a master-
piece : 1
“Gawd thed to Adam —‘Look, Adam,
at that ortyard.’ And Adam looked at
rowth and rowth and rowth of fruit
treeth ; peacheth, plumth, cherrieth, pine-
appleth, pumpkinth and Ithabella grapeth.
And Adam thed, ‘My word! ’ And Gawd
thed, ‘They are all yourth, Adam —the
whole blinking lot.’ And Adam thed,
‘Thank you, Gawd.’ You thee, Adam
wath very polite! And then he thed, T
thay, Gawd, what’th that tree over there
by itthelf?’ And Gawd thed, ‘Adam, you
can’t eat any of the fruit from that tree.’
And Adam thed, ‘Oh, Gawd, why can’t
I?’; and Gawd thed, ‘You jutht can’t,
Adam.’ But Adam wath very perthithtent
and kept nagging Gawd about that tree;
tho Gawd thed at latht, to thut Adam up,
Til tell you, Adam: we want the fruit
from that tree for jam!”’
That story was an undoubted success,
the more so no doubt because Mr. Ham
dramatised it as he told it with much
gesticulation, and the Deity speaking in
a low rumbling voice, and Adam in a
rather squeaky one. And the colloquial
tone and homely touches were certainly
appreciated. Those children thoroughly
understood the story.
But when the children got home and
repeated the story there was not such
marked appreciation shown by their
elders. In other ways, too, Mr. Ham
appeared altogether too modem, though
at first the other ways weren’t so obtru-
sive. The first two Sundays of his so-
journ at the Grey Box he attended Father
Moran’s church ; then for three weeks
he became a sturdy Methodist; and then
he appeared in the Church of England.
Then Mr. Ham transferred for a Sunday
or two to the Presbyterian kirk, and the
Rev. Dobbie told two old lady friends
that he found it hard to stifle the impulse
to throw him out. Mr. Dobbie had
played third-grade Rugby somewhere or
other in his youth, and from that cir-
cumstance retained —and added to —a
reputation for muscular Christianity.
After that assortment of worship, Mr.
Ham didn’t go to any church at all, .and
spent Sundays fishing or shooting. But
each religious body felt it had been un-
pardonably slighted and mocked.
Clearly, such a fellow was not fit to
train the young. People spoke of keeping
their children at home, or sending them
to the school at Two Rocks, or driving
into Summerlea every day with them, and
“putting them to the Convent,” or “the
public,” as the case might be. But the
children found Mr. Ham too entertain-
ing to desert him without protest.
Since Mrs. Foster was away there were
no sewing lessons for the girls, but Mr.
Ham had very practical ideas on sewing.
He set some of the big girls to work on
washing his socks and linen; others to
ironing or darning or sewing on buttons.
Good, practical training, but it wasn’t
understood. And later, when definite
complaint was made —in writing, to the
Inspector of Schools —the sewing came in
for very unfavorable notice: “He per-
suaded the girls to sew buttons on to the
most intimate parts of his garments.”
AS much as anything, perhaps, Mr.
Ham’s delightful rendering of the
story of Abraham and Isaac led to his
undoing. These estimable ancients
appeared refreshingly and familiarly as
Abe and Ikey:
“ ‘Blatht it all, Ikey, don’t arthk tho
many quethtionth—Gawd’ll thee uth
through’ . . .
“And when poor little Ikey wathn’t
looking, old Abe grabbed him—jutht like
thith” Mr. Ham seized on Georgie
Ryan suddenly and expertly, by way of
illustration. Georgie yelled with surprise,
and the rest did in pure delight.
“Then he truthed up Ikey and put him
on the heap of wood. Ikey kept rolling
hith eyeth, when Abe got the butcher’th
knife, and felt the edge of it with hith
thumb. Then Abe raithed hith eyeth to
Heaven and thed, ‘Gawd, it’th awful!'
But Gawd thed nothing. Then Abe took
little Ikey’th throat in one hand and the
knife came nearer and nearer to Ikey’th
throat. Little Ikey wriggled and wriggled
to keep hith throat out of the way, and
the look in hith eyeth brought a big lump
in Abe’th throat,
“And jutht ath the knife touched
Ikey’th throat. Gawd thouted out:
“Thtop it, Abe! That will be enough
thith time!”’
The children cheered, as much out of
relief as anything else, at this moving
climax.
Mr. Ham went on. “Abe wiped the
thweat off hith forehead with hith thleeve,
and thwallowed the lump in hith throat.
Then he cut the rope around Ikey.
And he kithed Ikey, and thed ‘My
word, Ikey, .that wath a clothe thave!’
“Jutht then they heard
a big row, and looking
round they thaw an
enormouth ram tangled
up in thome vineth. The
ram wath bellowing
jutht like a bull. And
Abe thed, ‘That ith a
miracle, Ikey.’ And
Gawd thed to Abe, in a
nice mild voice, ‘Uthe
that, Abe!’
“Tho Abe and Ikey
laid hold of that ram,
and wath n ’ t Abe
pleathed when he thaw
by the ear-markth that
it wathn’t one of hith
own ramth either, but belonged to a
neighbor he didn’t like very much!”
Just as remarkable in its way was the
finding of Moses in the bulrushes. In
Mr. Ham’s rendering the daughter of
Pharaoh didn’t appear in a good light, if
one judged her by modern moral stan-
dards. And, further, she shamefully de-
ceived her trusting father, who was made
to appear as a man of extraordinary
innocence and simplicity.
There was much resentful talk among
the parents, assisted by the activity of Mr.
Joshua Bisley, of Tipperary, and Mr. Ben-
jamin Hopper, of Summerlea. These two
famous lay-preachers and stout upholders
of religion and morality took Mr. Ham’s
treatment of the Scriptures’ as an insult
to the Deity and a reflection upon them-
selves. And though the Grey Box was,
strictly speaking, outside the territory of
their ministrations, they were ready to
ally themselves with the forces of right-
thinking. These gentlemen were in their
way just as interesting and picturesque as
Mr. Ham, but they had Heaven’s licence
to be so, and Mr. Ham hadn’t.
So Mr. Bisley drove in his buggy to
Summerlea, and went to the home of Mr.
Hopper.
IT was near the end of the day, Mr.
' Hopper, who was a carpenter and
builder, was sharpening and setting a
handsaw in his workshed. Mr. Bisley
was just in time to hear the exclamation:
“Blast the saw —that’s another bloody
tooth broken!”
Mr. Hopper looked up to see Mr.
Bisley framed in the doorway.
“Benjamin! Brother! You have said
that which is an abomination —Hi! —an
appalling abomination —Hi! —an annoy-
ance in the sight of the Lord.”
Mr. Hopper was all contrition, some
of it due to his being heard by Mr. Bisley.
“Brother, let us pray that our lips be
pure”; and Mr. Bisley’s fingers came to-
gether before him, and his venerable
head was bowed. His white beard
vibrated slightly in whispered commun-
ing with his Maker. And the prayer was
not for himself, but for a brother who
had erred —that made Mr. Bisley a grand
figure indeed. Mr. Hopper also bowed his
head, and felt keenly enough the disgrace
of being prayed for ; but absentmindedly
held the saw set in his hand. And even
while he prayed he squinted in sidelong
fashion at the saw on the bench.
When Mr. Bisley deemed that Mr.
Hopper might reasonably be considered
forgiven, he raised his head. In a solemn
voice he began, “Brother Benjamin, Sin
is stalking among our people, there is
corruption—Hi!—and mockery of God’s
word in our midst”
Mr. Hopper took his glance from the
guilty saw and trembled.
“I mean,” said Mr. Bisley, “A young
man who distorts and twists the sacred
Scriptures,”
“Ah!” Mr. Hopper was relieved
greatly. “Brother Bisley, you would be
thinking of that there young Mr. Ram at
the Grey Box? I tell you what. Brother,
he’s a bit of a goer, I do believe,”
Mr. Bisley held up his right hand.
“Brother Hopper, we must put our
shoulders to God’s wheel. Hi! And
hurl this unclean mocker into the dark-
ness.”
“Amen!” groaned Mr. Hopper,
Mr. Bisley wrinkled his nose, half-
closed his eyes, and concentrated on a
scarce audible sniff. In a tone half of
tender sorrow and half of honest anger,
he said, “Brother Benjamin!” Then he
sniffed quite audibly.
Mr. Hopper understood. “It was for
the cold. Nothing else cures a cold for
HlC<
“Nothing else, hi? Not even your
faith in the Lord!”
“Of course, of course,
but the two together just
fixes them real bad
colds.”
“Jerusalem must be
searched! ” It was a voice
of judgment and doom,
and Mr. Bisley advanced
further into the shed. In
a back corner was a large
box with a curved top.
It was closed. Ostensibly
it was for holding tools,
as several similar boxes,
with lids open, were em-
ployed.
Mr. Bisley found the
box was locked. He held
out the long fingers of his right
hand. “The key, Brother!”
Mr. Hopper took a key from the dusty
top of the low wall plate, and passed x it
over.
No more was said. Golden shafts from
the level sun lit up the interior of the
shed, and showed Mr. Hopper looking
somewhat rebelliously at the bent form of
the righteous Bisley opening the box.
The sounds were awful, the grating of
the key, the unsnapping of the lock, the
Squeak of the hasp and the creak of the
lid. Each sound was magnified tenfold,
and said as clearly as could be “Guilty! ”
In the box was a jumbled collection of
bottles —dozens and dozens of them.
Some of the labels were right side round
and allowed W. Rosen, F. Rosen, O.
Reimer, Summerlea Brewing Co.,
modestly to rub their shoulders with far
more famous distillers of joy from Scot-
land and Holland.
Mr. Bisley the dust from his
fingers and stood erect. He faced Mr.
Hopper. “Brother Benjamin Hopper, you
stand revealed. May God in His good-
ness, and, hi!, His sweet mercy, send
His light into the places that are dark
within you!” He looked as if he was
going to pray again. Mr. Hopper
hardened into a kind of defiance. He
was damned if he was going to be prayed
for again,
“I takes it for the cold.”
“Brother Benjamin, it is said, by the
sinful and the unworthy, who rejoice in
their sins, that you collected enough at
Kilmarnock to buy ten Bibles for our
dear dark brothers in Fiji, and, hi!, you
bought nine bottles of wine with it at
Otto Reimer’s.”
There was enough truth in this to hurt
—as a matter of fact it was only six
bottles —and Mr. Hopper was so stung
as to forget his saintly character and
calling.
“Look here, Bisley, you bloody tight-
lipped, white-bearded old humbug, Til be
telling you a few things what is said, if
it comes to that!”
Mr. Bisley held up a calming hand.
“Brother Benjamin!”
But Mr. Hopper was properly aroused.
“You’ve stolen cattle, you’ve stolen sheep,
you’ve stolen turkeys. You’ve stolen
grass and lucerne from your neighbors.
You carried on fine with that girl of
Sinclair’s before she became Mrs. Wittle.
And you’re going to preach at me be-
cause you find a few bottles in a box.”
Mr. Bisley wasn’t angered for himself,
though he was so for Mr. Hopper’s sake.
But Mr, Bisley’s anger was of the low
temperature kind, a placid anger that
was calculated to drive others mad.
It would have driven Mr. Hopper mad
perhaps if his attractive daughter had not
intervened. “That’s enough, now, you
two! I’ve heard the lot of it —and very
interesting, too. But tea’s ready. So
come along.”
Mr. Hopper kicked shut the damnable
box, but didn’t lock it. He still muttered
things under his breath, and in all seemed
likely to undo all the good of his con-
version of nearly twenty years ago.
But under the soothing influence of
food the men of wrath relented towards
each other and the conversation came
back to the proper object for condemna-
tion —Mr. Ham, It was revealed by Mr.
Hopper’s daughter that, besides giving
his curious interpretations of the Scrip-
tures, Mr. Ham “got Grade Nott to put a
stitch in his pants when he tore them
on the barb wire.”
“Hi!” said Mr. Bisley, “Grade is a
comely maiden and must be protected.”
“And he had the pants on when Gracie
mended them! ” ,
After tea the two famous lay-preachers
decided to see Mr. Hart, the Inspector
of Schools —just informally—and take
counsel with him.
MR. HART was at home. No, he
wasn’t too busy at all, and he was
pleased, he said, to see the two gentlemen.
Mr. Hart was a peppery-looking, import-
ant-looking man, of indeterminate age.
After pious preliminaries, Mr. Bisley
asked after Mr. Foster’s two broken legs.
“I regret,” said Mr. Hart crisply, “that
I can report no immediately promising
progress.”
“So he won’t be likely to be back at
that there school at the Grey Box yet?”

UNCABLED ADDITIONS
DIFFERENCES IN THE PEACE-MAKING.
(Condensed from a N.Y. “Times” editorial survey .)
In continuous efforts and in many con-
ferences, in which the United States and
Britain went out of their way to woo their
Russian partner with ever-increasing con-
cessions, there were evolved a number of
agreements which were supposed to lay
the firm foundations of the peace, with
only the details left to be filled in.
These agreements began with the
Atlantic Charter and the subsequent
acceptance of its principles by all of the
Allied nations. After this came the
Moscow agreement of November, 1943 ;
the Tehran agreement of December of
the same year; the Yalta agreement of
February, 1945 ; the San Francisco agree-
ments which culminated in the organisa-
tion of the United Nations, and the Pots-
dam agreement of August, 1945. These
agreements pledged all the Allied Powers
to seek no territorial expansion ; to
respect the right of all peoples to choose
their own form of government; to avoid
the use or the threat of force against
other nations; to create in Eastern
Europe democratic institutions of self-
government based on the will of the
people as manifested in free elections;
to re-establish a free and independent
Austria, to de-Nazify Germany and pre-
pare that country for self-government;
and to provide for the orderly transfer
to Germany of Germans living in Poland,
Hungary aid Czechoslovakia
With so much agreed upon, “in prin-
ciple,” it might have been exacted that
the making of the peace would be easy.
Yet the agreements contained three possi-
bilities of discord. The first was
.hat, beginning with Tehran, the agree-
ments involved a progressive abandon-
tnent ot the principles of the Atlantic
Charter in favor of power politics. The
second was that in such power politics
Russia demanded great concessions ot her
Western allies, without making reciprocal
concessions to their point of view, and
then proceeded to pocket her gains, and
to extend them by unilateral action, with-
out sanction of either ally or a peace
settlement.. The third, inevitable but none
the less fateful, was that the agreements
upset the previous balance of power, and
created huge vacuums in thq heart of
Europe into which other forces are now
pressing as if by natural law.
That Russia has pursued a, policy of
unilateral aggrandisement in violation of
the Atlantic Charter is no longer subject
to debate. Despite her pledge to leave terri-
torial issues to the peace settlement, she
has already annexed more than a quarter
of a million square miles of territory, with
some 24,000,000 people, and has
prompted her Polish satellite to annex the
German territories put under its admini-
stration, with the city of Stettin thrown
in as extra booty. Despite her pledge
of joint action in liberated Europe to en-
force the armistice terms and restore
liberty and democracy through free and
unfettered elections, Russia has hamstrung
the Allied Control Commissions within
her occupation areas to gain a free hand
for herself, and has used her troops, not
in the common interest, but to establish
her own political, economic and even
military hegemony over Poland, Rumania,
Bulgaria, Hungary, Yugoslavia, part of
Austria and Eastern Germany, imposing
on them a close approximation of her
own totalitarian system, under which a
Communist minority rules.
Despite the provision for economic and
administrative unification of Germany,
Russia, holding the German bread-basket,
has prevented economic unification and
has left it to the Western Allies to feed
their zones at their own expense, while
the Russo-Polish annexations in the east
have prompted France to demand similar
concessions in the west, and to veto Ger-
man administrative unification until she
achieves her aims.
Finally, all efforts to restore a free and
independent Austria have met with a
R uss j an veto, and the orderly transfer of
t h e Germans has been converted into a
mass expulsion of millions who are
dumped into the overcrowded and almost
s t arv ing American and British zones.

has been no attempt to saddle little coun-
tries with vast occupation armies on the
pl £a °f having to safeguard communica-
tion lines. Both the United States and
Great Britain are urging the greatest pos-
sihle reduction of the occupation armies
to permit Europe to live and breathe. At
the sacrifice of their own substance, they
are extending generous aid to all stricken
nations, victors and vanquished alike. It
that be “imperialism,” then let us have
more of it,
It is essential to keep this 'contrast in
mind at a time when bickering over
details and specious pleas that Russia is
justified in her actions because of the
“suspicions” which our alleged “lack of
co-operation” has aroused tend to obscure
it.
U.S. CONGRESS REPORT ON TITO.
(From a report by Republican and Democrat Congress members after visiting Yugoslavia .)
In Yugoslavia Marshal Tito reigns
supreme today. We found him, as well
as the other officials of Yugoslavia, to be
able, personable, but highly opinionated
and determined individuals. They are
ruling Yugoslavia as completely as the
men of the Kremlin rule Russia. Tito has
the voluntary support of perhaps 15 to 19
per cent, of the people of the cities and
from five per cent, down to zero per cent,
of the people in the villages and on the
farms. With an army of 700,000 or
800,000 men, and strong detachments
of troops carrying submachine-guns
marching through the streets of Belgrade
and posted before all public buildings as
guards, he is able to maintain order and
maintain his position.
An interesting sidelight on the posi-
tion of Marshal Tito was given by a
prominent private citizen of Yugoslavia
who holds no position in the Govern-
ment. We asked him, “Is Tito a stooge
of Russia, or is he willingly co-operating
with the Russians?” His reply was, “A
little of both,” and he explained as fol-
lows : “It must be remembered that Tito
had studied in Russia, had fought in the
Russian Army, and had long been a
Communist party worker and leader,
and that now he had become part of the
great International Comintern to the point
where he was no longer a free agent.
Consensus of opinion is that, having
committed as many crimes as he had, he
must now play the game for all that it is
worth because it was impossible to turn
back. It can be counted upon that Tito
will continue to put his lot with the Rus-
sians, since, even though he might desire
to liberalise policies and adopt the
methods of the Western democracies, he
has gone too far with Communism for
too long a time in order to be able with
personal safety to himself to alter his
attitude.”
On the whole, the situation in Yugo-
slavia reflects the vicious harvest which
comes from the appeasement policies
which the United States has been follow-
ing with regard to Russia ever since the
days of Yalta, and perhaps before. What
is true of Yugoslavia is equally true of
Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Ru-
mania and Bulgaria, to say nothing of
the brave little Baltic nations and other
countries in this region of the world,
Yugoslavia is today a Communistic
State. Tito has imposed upon the flag of
Yugoslavia the insigne of the hammer
and the sickle and his comparatively vast
armies are uniformed much like the Rus-
sians, with each soldier wearing a cap
decorated by a red star containing the
hammer and sickle,
In our opinion the U.S. Government
acted too hastily and with too little in-
formation in officially recognising the
regime of Marshal Tito.
“SECURITY” AGAINST WHOM?
{Condensed from a “United States News’’ article by David Lawrence .)
Why does Russia want a base on the
south shore of the Mediterranean? And
why does Russia inject herself so actively
in the Spanish problem, unless it is to
make sure thajt the Communists rule
Spain and another “friendly Govern-
ment” is poised at the western end of the
Mediterranean while Russian air forces,
based in North Africa, command the
narrow straits along Italy’s southern
shores —even as Turkey and Greece are
compelled to become “friendly” to
Russia in the eastern end of the Medi-
terranean? As a strategic blocking of
Britain’s route to the Suez and Asia,
what could be more suggestive?
Russia reiterates with an air of inno-
cence that all she wants is “security.”
But “security” against whom?
Immediately after V.E. Day it was
understandable that Russia should ask for
“security” against the return of German
aggression. Many people accepted
Russia’s move in swallowing up Poland,
and even overlooked Russia’s earlier
grab of Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania.
After all, it was argued, these States do
stand physically between Russia and a
possible invasion by German armies. But
now what can be said when Russia
actually controls the Balkan countries
next to her and reaches down for bases
in Africa?
In Asia the story has been no differ-
ent. Russia has injected her influence in
the war between the Communists and the
Chiang Government in China, and has
attempted to weaken MacArthur’s powers
in supervising the occupation of Japan.
On the territorial expansion side Russia
was awarded concessions in Mongolia
and Manchuria. She was given import-
ant bases in the Kuriles, where she never
fired a shot in the war against Japan.
Statesmen have a responsibility to
do more than think about these matters.
They must act.
What there is need of today is security
against one another among the four
Powers. This means security against divi-
sion and dissension, security against the
grabs made by one nation at the expense
of other nations, security against those
subtle and divisive influences which tend
to make the major Powers suspicious.
Hitler played Britain against' Russia
and won. Stalin and Molotov were
dickering first with Britain and then with
Germany until finally they made a treaty
with Germany that gave Hitler his chance
to bomb Poland and begin World War
11. No League of Nations or covenant
or special treaties of alliance can guard
against the materialism which causes
Governments to go along with Fascists
one year and then, when it suits their
purpose, fight such Fascists, giving lip
service to Atlantic Charters and “no an-
nexation” pledges, and then reverting
afterwards to demands made in the earlier
stages of the game of coercion, seizure
and expansion.
SOVIET-ARGENTINA DEAL.
(,From a report by a N.Y. “World-Telegram”
staff writer.)
The American Communist party, which
had been trying to push the United States
into a break with “Fascist Argentina” on
high moral grounds, suddenly turned
to defend Soviet Russia’s trade and dip-
lomatic pact with Argentina as good
business and smart diplomacy,
“As Molotov once remarked,” de-
clared the “Daily Worker,” the party’s
official mouthpiece, quoting the Soviet
Foreign Minister, “the art of diplomacy is
to increase one’s friends and diminish
one’s enemies.”
Communists had been demanding that
Argentina be outlawed. The pronounce-
ment on Argentina duplicated the pattern
set when the American Communist party,
after recovering from its initial shock,
tried to justify the Hitler-Stalin non-
aggression pact just before the outbreak of
World War II. At that time, Molotov
was quoted as remarking that Fascism is
merely a matter of taste.
. “Politically speaking,” said the
“Worker’s” policy-making editorial on
the Soviet deal with Argentina, “the
Soviet action is a demonstration to the
Anglo-American bloc that it doesn’t really
control the whole world as it so belliger-
ently imagines. We cannot expect the
Soviet Union to deprive itself of obvious
advantages just because of the ‘mistakes’
of American policy,”
{As seen by N.Y. “Times."'}
Argentina and Soviet Russia had been
more at loggerheads than almost any two
other countries that have not been at war
with each other. Argentina made the
motion expelling Russia from the League
of Nations in 1939; Russia made every
effort at San Francisco to block Argen-
The Western Allies fought during the
first six critical months after the Nor-
mandy invasion “with no information on
matters affecting the Russian grand
strategy,” Gen. Eisenhower has revealed
in his report on the western fighting. It
was not until January, 1945, that a
staff group from his headquarters, headed
by Air Chief Marshal Tedder, Eisen-
hower’s deputy, received from Marshal
Stalin a full explanation of Russia’s plans
for a coming four-pronged offensive.
Eisenhower noted that the Russian forces
in this drive totalled 150 to 160 divi-
sions, but he said that a policy of the
Western Allies of building their divisions
to 17,000-man strength meant that the 90
divisions under Eisenhower late in the
war numbered “well over twice the
strength of Russian divisions.” —Chicago

has been no change, either, in economic
conditions. Soviet Russia may some day
be the great industrial nation that
“Izvestia” boasts she now is—in explain-
ing the new pact to the Russian people--
with industrial machinery to export. It
is doubtful now if she has even one
machine to ship, unless it be some excess
military ’planes, guns and tanks. And
agricultural Argentina has little to export
that the Soviet does not already possess,
often in even greater measure.
The only possible answer is that the
motivation was purely political on both
sides. Perdn undoubtedly believes it will
help him in his effort to establish him-
self as the strong man of South America.
He may view Communism as attractive
bait with which to hold in line his “shirt-
less ones” —as he himself describes the
great mass of his political followers. He
has bragged that he is smarter than other
Fascist dictators, that he will profit from
their obvious mistakes.
For Moscow, the recognition of the
Argentine Government gives them more
diplomatic representation in Catholic
Latin America than in any other area
except Europe. Two years ago Europa
Encyclopedia listed only two Latin-
American countries with which Moscow
had diplomatic relations, Mexico and
Cuba. Today she has established relations
(in addition to Argentina, Mexico and
Cuba) with Brazil, Chile, Colombia, the
Dominican Republic, Costa Rica, Guate-
mala, Panama, Uruguay and Venezuela.
Negotiations have been under way with
other Latin-American countries.
It would seem to behove the United
States to keep in good repair its own
diplomatic fences in Latin America. A
conflict of ideas, and of diplomacy, is
shaping up to the south as well as in
Europe and Asia,
(N.Y. "Daily News” view.)
Only yesterday the Russian Govern-
ment was damning Col. Juan D. Peron
and his “colonels’ clique” in Argentine
Government circles as a bunch of Fascist
beasts whose country should on no
account be admitted to the United
Nations.
The U.S. State Department, needled
by the Russians and their Red and Pink
stooges in the U.S., kept making fists at
Argentina, and finally succeeded in getting
the Argentinians’ backs up so high that
they elected Peron their President by a
record-breaking electoral vote.
Have a look at what Stalin has gone
and dope to these followers of his party
line! He has had a purchasing delegation
in the Argentine for some time ; and now
Russia and Argentina have resumed full
diplomatic relations after a 27-year lapse!
Flowers were tossed back and forth
between Moscow and Buenos Aires, com-
pliments and kisses were exchanged, and
an international love feast was aired by
press and radio. All is forgiven. Stalin
finds that Peron is a fine fellow and vice
versa.
This reversal is not as grotesque as it
looks. If, as charged, the Argentine Gov-
ernment is heavily tainted with Fascism,
then Russian-Argentine friendship is only
natural. There is no real difference be-
tween Fascism and Communism.
Of course, the Stalin-Perdn love feast
is hard on the U.S. Reds, Pinks, “liberals,”
fellow travellers, etc., in that it makes
them look pretty silly in view of their
wild cursings of Peron and all his works.
They’ll probably get over it, though, after
a little retching. Hitler’s Germany looked
fine to these folks as long as Stalin had
a friendship treaty with Hitler —a treaty
which helped Hitler to crush democratic
France and pin democratic Britain to the
wall during the first 22 months of the
war.
(N.Y. " Daily Mirror” view.)
That’s a colossal joke down in
Argentine. The United States of America
is the butt of it.
Soviet Russia and Argentine have de-
cided to kiss and shack up—economically
and diplomatically. American prestige
takes a nosedive. We [U.S.] brushed
Argentina off, meddled in her internal
affairs, called names, told her what kind
of a Government she should have. Per-
haps we were trying to appease Soviet
Russia in all this, because, earlier, at the
San Francisco Conference, Russia had
objected to taking “Fascist” Argentina
into U.N.O. Maybe the U.S. State
Department thought that set the pace
for us. Maybe our brainy diplomats
figured we’d get in good with Russia b>
smacking Argentina with a “White
Paper.”
And maybe the Argentinians and their
new-found buddies are just laughing their
heads off now —at us!

Presumably it was not the intention of the

despair that the Nazi regime would look
attractive in retrospect or that Communism
might seem the only way out. But some
aspects of occupation policy have certainly

are out of the race. A scramble for their

While American policy toward Russia has
hardened, recognition of the necessity for a
check on unlimited Soviet expansion has not
always been accompanied by recognition of the
equal or perhaps greater necessity for stimu-
lating recovery in Europe and particularly for
framing conditions under which Central Europe
can exist without pauperisation, mass unem-
ployment, semi-starvation and doles ftp ll }
America and England. It is noteworthy that
Secretary Byrnes has stressed two important
points in this connection. He bluntly intimated
we couldn’t continue to carry out the repara-
tions programme unless Germany is adminis-
tered as an economic unit, and continued:
“Whatever boundaries are agreed upon for
Germany, she must be able to exist without ex-
ternal assistance. We cannot subsidise Ger-
many to enable her to pay reparations to
other nations.” This would seem the simplest
dementary commonsense from the standpoint
of American interests, yet it represents a con-
siderable step forward from the vengeful folly
of the Morgenthau plan. Another important
conclusion from Secretary Byrnes is that there
can be no economic recovery until and unless
European countries, excluding Germany, are rid
of the burden of occupation forces. This is
especially important because the presence of
huge Russian armies living off the countryside
is a major cause of threat of famine in Europe.

The term “officer” is and must be a proud
one; as long as armies endure, an officer corps
must be the heart and soul of any army.
Abolish it, minimise its importance, try to
merge it with enlisted ranks and you have no
army. The Russians tried it, and for years
there were no titles, no real badges of rank,
no salutes and no distinctions between officer
and enlisted man in the Red Army. These regu-
lations and the political commissars made the
pre-war Russian Army an armed mob and cost
Russia dearly in the Finnish campaign, and in
the first years of the struggle against Germany.

Hong Kong affords yet another glimpse into
the odd ways of the Japanese. They were
often spoken of during the war as being little
monsters of practical efficiency. That, it turns
.out, is very far from being so. They neglected
to take the most obvious health precautions in
Hong Kong with a degree of slackness that
would be shameful in the most primitive
authorities. Malaria was the scourge or the
early British garrisons. It had been completely
wiped out a good many years ago. Now it is
back, because the Japanese allowed the care-
fully-constructed drainage system to go to ruin.
They did not even bother to enforce the most
simple precautions which would only involve
easy work for unskilled coolies. They did not
even stop the casual throwing out of petrol tins,
which experience had long ago shown collect
water and serve as breeding grounds for the
mosquito.— Manchester “Guardian” correspon-

The block leader, keystone of the Nazi party,
the man who reported on his neighbor’s private
life, is still with the Germans in the Russian
zone, only now he has new colors. He belongs
to the S.E.D., an amalgamation of Germany s
Communists and Social Democrats. The Ein-
heit [Unity], as the S.E.D. party is known, is
being whooped up by the Russians and Ger-
man Communists and Socialists as Germany s
hope. Nationalistic in that it insists on Ger-
man economic unity and no further territorial
division, the Einheit is touted by its supporters
as the mainspring of the new Germany’s belief,
a truly solidified workers’ party. To disil-
lusioned Communists (there seem to be quite
a few) and Socialists and to members of the
Christian and Liberal parties, the Einheit
appears as a typical Soviet manoeuvre to create
a “common front” which Stalinists will take
over completely. In such a party as the Ein-
heit, the block warden plays a vital rdle just
as he did for the Nazis. It is the block leader
who hands out ration cards, who first recom-
mends his neighbor for a certain ration cate-
gory, who reports on his neighbor’s visitors and
his neighbor’s remarks, and who reports on
his neighbor’s “political stability.”— -Chicago

The struggle against Communism is the only

the frontier of the Western Powers, being

The clandestine movement into
southern Korea of large numbers
of both Japanese and Korean
refugees from north Korea and
•Manchuria [both Russian
“spheres of influence”] is seri-
ously taxing the ability of the
American military authorities to
handle the migrants. From 500
to 2000 Koreans daily slip
through the thinly patrolled line
of the Thirty-eighth Parallel.
From February to the first or
June as many as 10,000 Koreans
have been coming down from
the Soviet occupation zone every
week. During the month of May
the influx of Japanese civilians
from the north ran up to 14,000.
Both Koreans and Japanese are
in poor physical condition and
suffering from undernourish-
ment and are destitute. — From a report by a
N.Y. “Times” correspondent in Korea.

There is no doubt that any peace made
without Russia, or without Russia’s willing
co-operation, will remain precarious. But
unlike Russia, which thrives on disorder, the
democracies cannot live without the sanction
of formal laws based on agreement or con-
sent. No such law is possible in Europe until
the new European order is by
formal treaties of peace.— N.Y, “Times.”

Britain’s manpower is shrinking, the inevi-
table result of a declining birthrate between
world wars. Latest statistics emphasise the
seriousness of the labor supply situation and the
need for increased output per man hour. For
the first time since the end of the war, the
male working population, now 14.6 million,
has fallen below pre-war totals. , There are a
greater number of women employed in industry
than-before the war, but the total labor force
at 20.4 million is only 680,000 above the pre-
war level. More and more women continue to
leave industrial jobs, and today female workers
are 946,000 fewer than in June, 1945. If the
Government is to attain its goal of a labor
force of 20 million in 1947 some way will have
to be figured out to keep 500,000 more women
at industrial work than were employed in
1939. Britain’s only possibility of immediately
increasing her male labor force lies in relaxing
immigration restrictions upon suitable foreign
labor. General Anders’s demobilised Polish
army is an obvious choice, but the trade
unions, despite the existing labor shortage,
aren’t enthusiastic about admitting foreigners.

INTO THE GOLDEN AGE.
Addressing a gathering of his trade-
union and A.L.P. bosses in Melbourne,
the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth
blithely declared that Australia was mov-
ing into a Golden Age, “if the right
political and economic measures are
taken.” With that, one of the A.L.P.
bosses, a Mr, Hayes, intimated that the
people would be permitted to usher in
the Golden Age on September 28 by
voting the ticket. Mr. Chifley came in
as an echo of this Mr. Hayes, of whom
95 per cent, of Australians have never
heard, three days later. In other days
Prime Ministers made a point of reserving
election-date announcements for them-
selves ; but we live in unusual times.
To the ancient Greeks the Golden Age
was, in the dictionary version, “an era
of perfect happiness which was identi-
fied with the reign of Chronos and the
elder gods.” Possibly Mr. Chifley would
pass for Chronos, and in his Cabinet-
room he is certainly surrounded by
elderly, if not recognisably godlike,
gentlemen, the youngest being Mr. Ward
and Mr. Calwell, both in the late forties.
No doubt all these worthies “fleet the
time pleasantly as they did in the golden
world.” For fleeting, in the mechanical
sense, they have at their disposal Gov-
ernment trains, trams and ’buses (in
N. S. Wales, where seven of them hail
from, the Government trams and ’buses
were run at an admitted loss of “over
£300,000” last year, and such of them as
use the Government trains in South Aus-
tralia, Westralia and Tasmania know
that their systems are insolvent), and for
all of them there are the latest-model
fluid-drive Chrysler cars, complete with
chauffeurs and everything. And those
who care to travel in privately-owned
’planes, which comes expensive (though
not to Ministers and their retinues), are
privileged to follow their bent. The
electors of Capricornia have become
familiar with the spectacle of Mr. Forde
descending from one of these aerial cara-
vans, his mouth exuding soft soap and
his hands full of Greek gifts.
In the Golden Age of Hesiod men
“lived free from bodily infirmities or
the necessity of tilling the soil.” The
prospect of deliverance from bodily in-
firmities has been dimmed by the harsh
fate of Professor Bogomolets, “Hero of
the Soviet Union,” who announced in
June that he had invented a magic serum
which, besides curing cancer, t.b., heart-
disease and everything down to whitlows
and corns, would prolong life until 70
years beyond the allotted span, and
who died in the ensuing month,
two years before he had qualified for
the old-age pension. But in four war
years under “Labor’s” “wheat-acreage
restriction” arrangement, a great many
Westralian farmers were relieved from
the necessity of tilling the soil, being
paid about a million and a quarter for
not growing wheat,, even when millions
of people in Asia and Europe were starv-
ing for lack of it. Those other farmers
in Westralia and other States who grew
1945-46 wheat are to have part of the
proceeds seized by the architects of the
new Golden Age without having any
equity in the said part if, through death
or misfortune, they cease to grow any
more; and thousands of them, contem-
plating drought - stricken fields, are
gloomily wondering whether Nature has
not set its canon against any more tilling
of the soil for wheat in their districts.
In the Golden Age of old the pastoral
industry was carried on 'by shepherds
who tended their flocks, killing time
by blowing on pipes and sporting
with Amaryllis in the shade. Aus-
tralian pastoralists are not exactly
addicted to these pursuits and pastimes,
but so many of them and their sons
went off to the wars and on returning
found their properties and finances in so
bad a state in consequence of drought,
sky-high taxes, Government seizure of
profits over and above the “guaranteed
price,” less charges, and denial of labor,
machinery, parts, fuel, building and fenc-
ing materials and fertiliser that an en-
forced return to the Old (Hellenic) Order
is not impossible. It would mean living
on the smell of an oil rag, but there
would be an escape from the punishment
“Labor” has devised for them and other
“capitalists,” and tastefully expressed by
■■'Mr. Chifley to the Melbourne party of
his bosses; “It is true, as far as the
higher incomes are concerned, that Aus-
tralia is the highest-taxed country in the
world.” And there would be plenty of
girls about with very little to do.
The Golden Age of the Greeks was
an age without coal. Here the Golden
Age of Chifley may furnish an exact
parallel. Under the “Labor” dispensa-
tion, which in this matter is determined
by Communists acting under orders from
Moscow, production of this substance
has diminished so persistently that its
total disappearance may be only a matter
of time.
For want of coal Australia has been
reduced to privations such as no other
civilised community has endured since
coal began to be burnt by man. Over
many months, though not all the time,
communities great and small have had to
do without trams, trains, sleeping berths,
electric light, radio, gaS for all the pur-
poses for which gas is used and the fuel
requirements of all manner of industries.
In Victoria industries dependent on
N.S.W. coal have been denied supplies
for six weeks, and in Adelaide on Wed-
nesday night a general closing of factories
and workships was added to severe re-
strictions on private use of gas and elec-
tricity in the depth of winter.
There would be coal enough for every-
one and everything if the N.S.W. miners
were faithful to their awards, which
oblige them only to work about 35 or 36
hours a week for 50 weeks in the year
less public holidays. They owe a special
duty to the men who fought for the
country and preserved it when, as Mr.
Curtin himself revealed, s.-p. book-
makers, dog-trainers, billiard-markers,
taxi-drivers and other shirkers stole into
the mines to avoid having to fight the
foreign enemy. With honorable excep-
tions in pits uncorrupted by Communist
larrikinism, they have betrayed these
men and their fellow-citizens in general,
and “Labor” has connived at the be-
trayal. In its cowardice and twisted
logic “Labor” has yielded to the dic-
tatorship of a selfish minority and ac-
cepted the dictum, perilous to any democ-
racy, that everything must be done for
the selfish minority and nothing by it.
There will be a shortage of houses —
except roadhouses —in the new Golden
Age, especially for returned warriors,
who were promised them by the hundred
thousand, with all mod. cons. But when
this situation is accepted “Labor” and
its Lazzarinis will be spared the impor-
tunities of returned warriors, many of
whom in any case have been grounded
in the art of living in single rooms, huts
and caves; and though the scarcity of
rooms and huts will continue the supply
of caves is unlikely to give out. And
there will be lots of racecourses, includ-
ing the one, “worthy of the city of Syd-
ney,” with which N.S.W. “Labor’s” Turf
Club, that noble Japanese-war achieve-
ment, is to decorate the landscape out
beyond superannuated Rosebery; and
here the plebs will be privileged to see
the new aristocracy of bookmakers, car-
cass butchers, sporting publicans, dinner-
dance-restaurant proprietors, profiteers,
blackmarketeers and assorted tax-dodgers
disporting themselves. There will be
lots of legalised s.-p. joints and Govern-
ment lottery shops also. And since no-
body will be required to do anything too
closely resembling work, “Labor” may
choose to proclaim itself the
Party, directing the population to get its
living by wagering with and selling lottery
tickets to one another.
Unfortunately there is a threat to the
new Golden Age from the north.
Java is for the most part in the hands
of colored boys, taught by Japanese to
hate the whites, trained and armed by
Japs, and, since Japan gave in, inspired
and guided by Communists from Sydney
and Brisbane as well as Moscow. In the
interior of Java there are 30,000 Dutch
and Eurasian internees. Though nearly 12
months have elapsed since the Japanese
Emperor capitulated, these unfortunates
are still at the mercy of the colored Com-
munist youth, “half-savage and half-
child.” They receive meagre supplies of
food, but are in rags and are without
medical requisites. They may all die,
violently or by hunger or sickness, before
the Dutch can rescue them. And the
gangs of Soekarno, who collaborated with
the Japanese when they were in the
ascendant, are in full control of Sumatra.
In Java, Amboina and Dutch Timor
natives saw Australians, Americans and
British defeated and the survivors
rounded up and carried off by Japanese.
In Java and Dutch Borneo natives took
part in the fiendish destruction of helpless
white servicemen, Aussies among them.
From Australia, the native races
learned, armed Japanese bands no doubt
passing on the news, that the Communist-
contrdlled waterfront unions had cham-
pioned the cause of their “Indernesian
comrades” and had held up seven Dutch
ships loaded or about to be loaded with
Australian supplies for the Dutch East
Indies. In the ensuing ten months of the
boycott, which embraced a damaged
Dutch destroyer putting in fruitlessly for
repairs, it must have been conveyed to
these natives that “Labor” was a party
to it, and that “Labor’s” attitude was in
keeping with Dr. Evatt’s assumption
of the leadership of Central Ameri-
cans, Peruvians, Paraguayans, Persians,
Arabians, Egyptians, Liberians and the
rest at U.N.O.'.meetings and the like.
In their exuberance natives butchered
three Australian officers engaged in col-
lecting evidence against Japanese war
criminals. This atrocity remains un-
avenged by “Labor,” which contented it-
self with sending a District Court Judge
from Sydney to Java to furnish Mr.
Forde with an addition to his pyramids
of reports. The leaders of the murderers
and their compatriots fell into the
habit of addressing Communist bosses in
Sydney and Brisbane as if they were the
rulers of Australia. This was done when
Indonesians who had stolen a Dutch
schooner at Merauke cast up at Thursday
Island, from which place they sent an
appeal for protection and a setting aside
of international law and practice in their
favor to the, Brisbane Trades Hall.
Brooding on some of these events, Dr.
Gaha, “Labor” M.H.R. for Denison
(Tas.), who occasionally blurts out things
disconcerting to his party, though he
never follows them up, issued a warning
that a new enemy was in the making in
the Netherlands East Indies; another
Japan, equal in population, already in
part militarised and cancered with irate,
and in a geographical situation much
more favorable to armed invasion of or
thrusting of shiploads of illicit immi-
grants into Australia. Apparently realis-
ing that this amounted to a shattering
criticism of “Labor” policy which might
mean expulsion, the doctor said no more,
but the memory of his impertinence re-
mains at Canberra, and the danger grows.
It may end in “Labor” having to Save
the Country again, not by waging war as
it did in the 1941-42 island campaigns
north of Mr. Ward’s Brisbane Line —
that is to say, in Rabaul, Amboina, Java
and Timor —but by squealing once more,
“without any inhibitions,” to the Yanks.
Our Roaring Lamb.
A renewed outbreak of newspaper
puffing of Dr. Evatt concided with a
rapid deterioration in the industrial situa-
tion and outlook, a consequence of the
dearth, of N.S.W. coal, itself a conse-
quence of Dr. Evatt’s failure, as Attorney-
General, to secure the enforcement of the
industrial laws and his own National
Security regulations against workstoppers
and loafers. “Banging his fist on the
rostrum at the Paris Peace Conference,
Dr. Evatt demanded that the 1? small
nations should have equality of voting
with the Big Four in the final determina-
tion of the treaties for the Axis satellite
nations.” So one account ran, and from
the same quarter came the assurance that
“Dr, Evatt’s move created a sensation”;
he “stole the show.”
There was a great deal more of this
stuff. No doubt Dr. Evatt’s friends and
colleagues hope that it will reconcile Aus-
tralians to the many deprivations im-
posed on them, to the compulsory idleness
in which many of them have been plunged
and which threatens many more, and to
the prospect, especially grim for house-
less servicemen, of a total cessation of
home-building in N. S. Wales “because of
the lack of transport”—vouched for at a
Sydney Labor Council meeting by a dele-
gate from the Transport Workers. But
in this the friends and colleagues are
wrong. The public is too mindful of its
own injuries to take pride in the posing
and gasconading of Dr. Evatt, however
dressed up by sentimental newspapermen.
Even the intelligence that in the latest
phase of his box-the-compass politics he
had chosen to fail out with Molotov seems
to have left the public cold.
When the wandering Minister was last
in Australia Molotov figured as one of
the gods of his idolatry—though in reality
he has only one, Herbert Vere Evatt. He
said then, it having been pointed out that
Russia had annexed just on 274,000
square miles of territory in Europe and
Asia, inhabited by 24,355,000 people who
had never been under Russian rule since
the dawn of Russian history—though
Russia had renounced annexations by
virtue of its oft-proclaimed adherence to
the Atlantic Charter —it was all explic-
able and justifiable:
Having during the last four years come
to know some of Russia’s greatest states-
men, I take the view that the Soviet Union’s
policy is directed towards self-protection
and security against future attack.
He even contended that Russian sus-
picion and greed (of course he didn’t use
these expressions) were warranted by
British policy in 1938-39:
Russia was kept out of the pale, and was
not brought into any alliance against
Hitler —was kept out of any alliance till
1941, when Hitler actually attacked the
Soviet I am including Britain. I am not
overlooking anything.
Daladier, the 1938-40 French Prime
Minister, has made nonsense of these
gross misrepresentations.
Daladier has revealed that Russia
could have had in July, 1939, the Franco-
British alliance for which it had made
overtures, with Poland as another partner.
The Polish Government, yielding to
Franco-British representations, had
agreed to let the Red Army march across
Poland, so that if Germany started
trouble it would have to take a war on two
fronts for which—unless Keitel and Jodi
lied like redshanks at Nuremberg—it was
certainly not then prepared, having only
23 divisions in the West. The negotiations
failed, and the world catastrophe came,
because the two-faced crew at Moscow
had already arranged the partition of
Poland with the Nazis.
Going on his travels again, Dr. Evatt
discovered that American opinion had
set hard against Soviet imperialism, and
he immediately accommodated his tactics
to the changed situation. This is his
practice, and he said so much in the new
vein that friendly Americans ignorant of
his habitual surrender to Communists in
his own country began to hail him as a
rising hope of democracy against Russian
greed and the Communist conspiracy.
Before crossing the Atlantic he had
learned that the British had been baited
into sharp opposition to the inordinate
proceedings of their faithless ally. But in
his vain self-sufficiency he took his own
line, choosing to tackle Molotov in such a
way as to admit of that worthy scoring
at his expense and that of Australia.
Dr, Evatt advanced the argument that
Australia, which, in accordance with the
ignoble policy of his “Government,” did
not contribute a company of soldiers to
the defeat of Germany in Europe, though
little New Zealand had a grand division
in Italy, was entitled to an equal vote
with Britain and America and Russia,
which country in its contest with Ger-
many lost the equivalent of the entire
population of Australia in dead alone.
Molotov’s too-telling counterthrust was
that peace treaties painfully hammered
out by Foreign Ministers whose countries
would have the policing of them could
not in equity be placed at the mercy of
a bare majority of small nations which,
if the necessity for enforcement arose,
would be merely lookers-on.
There is much matter for criticism in
all the arrangements for Italy, Finland,
Hungary, Rumania and Bulgaria, but in
the desperate situation of these countries
and of Germany it is better to have bad
peace treaties than no peace treaties at all.
While Dr. Evatt was barging away use-
lessly in Paris, his “Government” intro-
duced its Coal Industry Bill, for which
there would never have been any excuse
if he, as Attorney-General, had stood up
to his responsibilities. In an able second-
reading speech Mr. Menzies catalogued
the results of Evatt weakness in terms of
coal-production lost because of strikes
and “absenteeism”:
In 1942, 912,000 tons were lost because
of Strikes and 901,000 tons because of
absenteeism ; in 1943, 1,284,000 tons and
190.000 tons ; in 1944, 1,524,000 tons and
1.123.000 tons ; in 1945, 2,347,000 tons and
128.000 tons. ,
And the Opposition-leader quoted from
the report of Justice Davidson, which
the “Government” has discarded, though
Justice Davidson was its own choice as
Royal Commissioner. The quotations
may be amplified:
Especially in the northern and southern
.districts of N. S. Wales, discipline is
almost non-existent among members of the
Miners’ Federation, though observed by
mineworkers who are not members of it.
Lack of discipline is mainly due to:
(a) weak and divided leadership in the
Miners’ Federation ; ( b ) a political an-
tagonism between mineworkers who are
Communists and those who are opposed
to the doctrines and activities of Com-
munists ; (c) political intrigue ; id) the
success achieved by nearly all strikes m
gaining some concessions ; (e) inability or
reluctance of the Government to enforce the
law against large numbers of individual
strikers or absentees ; (/) appeasement in
yielding to improper demands.
All this with Dr. Evatt as Attorney-
General. Yet for part of 1942 output was
satisfactory—for this reason:
Prosecutions and action under National
Security Act regulations and the Coal Pro-
duction (Wartime) Act for absenteeism and
other offences achieved a considerable
amount of success and might have had
more if pursued inexorably.
But Dr. Evatt weakened to the extent of
waiving fines and transferring the imposi-
tion of “discipline” to “the Miners’ Fed-
eration executive” whose leader was, and
is, a Communist, and whose “attempts” to
impose discipline were “a failure.
In the same year, Dr. Evatt removed toe
Menzies ban on Communist organisa-
tions and publications. He thus enabled
them to proceed from weakness to
strength, and in process of time to violate
the very undertakings they had given to
him as a condition of their restoration to
favor. In the meantime, he and nis
“Government” had accepted the Com-
munists as referendum allies, bo ia
from their outrages provoking him t
bang his fist on the table in real or simu-
lated anger he has never been known
to utter a word against any of them
their detestable conspiracy.


PLAIN ENGLISH
No Wheat, No Money.
Comrade Scully had scarcely had his
great Wheat Stabilisation Bill shoved
through the House, cheered on by Com-
rades—Breen, from Calare, Langtry, from
Riverina, Lemmon, from Forrest, Mount-
joy, from Swan, and the rest —when it
came out that the wheat prospects, at
best patchy in the Langtry electorate,
through Calare into Gwydir and on into
Queensland were very bad indeed, drouth
obtaining from the Lachlan River north-
ward. Southern and south-western
Queensland have rarely been in a
worse state, and north-west N. S. Wales
faces heavy stock losses and a possible
total wheat failure. In Victoria and S.A.
things are much better and so far Wes-
tralia seems to be in good heart.
The ramshackle Scully scheme is more
notable for what it doesn’t provide than
for what it does. There is no provision
for payments out of the “stabilisation
fund” in the event of death or retirement
from wheat-farming, nor is there any pro-
vision for a grower to draw on it when
his crop fails. It is only for growers who
possess wheat.
In effect, growers whose crops fail this
year, though they have wheat in the
1945-46 pool on which there is extra
money swinging, will not be able to get
any of it to tide them over into the next
season against interest, living expenses,
fuel, super, and seed for the 1947 crop,
if any. All they can hope for are drought-
relief handouts from tax revenue. And
that prospect displeases.
What has happened is that the wheat-
grower has been socialised. He must
first have a licence to grow wheat, he
must hand over his wheat to the Govern-
ment, he must take what the Government
gives him and he must wait for the full
fruits of his labor upon some extremely
problematical time when the Government
decides upon further payment. Meantime
he has no equity in the profits on sales
of his own wheat. He is denied the use of
his own money for making improvements,
meeting commitments or offsetting the
losses of drought.
If the drought position continues and
spreads thousands of 1945 growers whose
1946 crops are a total loss will have a
crow to pluck with the Scullys on
September 28.
Votes for Bobby-soxers.
Blatant vote-catching is one of the
reasons behind the move for reducing the
voting age to 18. Federal “Labor” didn’t
think of it in time for the Commonwealth
elections, but a raft of State elections is
due next year, and “Labor” is in office
everywhere but in South Australia.
During the 20 years between the wars
it became a popular catchcry that this is
the Age of Youth. A favorite bleat of
the Flapper Press, it has been shouted
by a host of Youth Movements, the main
characteristic of whose members is a
desire to be older. If this is the Age of
Youth it can be so for one of two reasons
—that young people form a higher per-
centage of the population than they did
in the past, or that their contribution to
the world’s welfare is greater than of
yore.
Obviously the first alternative is out
of court. Never in the history of the
world has the average age of its people
been so high, and with falling birthrates
and the advance of medical science it
will tend to become higher still. On the
score of achievement the argument also
breaks down. Leadership today is less in
the hands of Youth than it ever was.
Alexander the Great, at 29, was master
of the ancient world. Napoleon con-
quered Italy at 28 and was ruler of
France at 30. The second Pitt was Prime
Minister of England at 24. The present
day can show nothing to parallel these
cases; the three Allies whose combined
might overthrew Hitler were led by me!n
in their sixties.
Youth flung itself valiantly into the
struggle for freedom, but under Hitler's
banner it fought every bit as whole-
heartedly for the powers of darkness.
Therein lie at once the virtues and
weaknesses of youth. Courage and enthu-
siasm ; zeal for a cause, without the
ability to judge the justice of the cause;
enthusiasm for the new, without the
capacity to assess the real worth of the
new; eagerness to build without the
patience to put in the spadework on the
foundations; ability to destroy without
the experience to discriminate between
what should and should not be destroyed.
These are the attributes of youth, though
they are by no means confined to the
young—in particular the demerits often
remain after the virtues of youth have
been outgrown.
A peculiarity of the suggestion for re-
ducing the voting age is that it should come
from a Ministry with the highest average
age in Commonwealth history, headed
by the country’s oldest Prime Minister.
A surprising thing is that it should come
at a time when the 18-21-year-olds are,
through no fault of their own, least fitted
to exercise the franchise. Six years of
war have affected teenagers more than
other sections of the community. Parental
restraints have been largely absent; arti-
ficial war-time prosperity has warped
their sense of values; the bjackmarket
and other rackets have given them
a false standard of morality. To a
degree this applies to all the community,
but the effect on the impressionable teen-
ager is more marked and will be harder
to counteract as the youngster has no
reseiYoir of pre-war experience on which
to draw.
The argument “if he’s old enough to
fight he’s old enough to vote” was used
to extend the franchise to servicemen
under 21, and is being revived to support
the further extension. It was, in the
kindest view, mere sentimental blah, in
the more cynical opinion just an angling
for votes, and the latest suggestion is no
more.
As Diggers can testify there was never
any sign of a great outcry for the vote from
young soldiers nor of a wave of gratitude
and enthusiasm at its granting. Most of
the youngsters who received that gift of
grace have since turned or will soon turn
21, and in any case there is no suggestion
of taking away the gift once given. But
there is no case for further extension of
the right to vote. There is no particular
virtue or magic in the age of 21, but it
FIRST OFFERING.
“As a sequel to the release of more bacon and ham, pork, which has been off the Australian
market for five years, is about to be made available to the public by Labor. The Federal
president of the Pigbreeders’ Society warns pork butchers that they will have to scramble tor
supplies.”
“Butchered to make vote-fodder for you/”
has by acceptance and legal practice be-
come the age at which a minor becomes
a full-fledged citizen. Because of that it
was adopted as the voting age, and unless
some very sound reasons other than the
Age of Youth fallacy and the “old enough
to fight” poppycock can be produced there
is no case for lowering it.
A Tropic Town.
From “Ek Dum,” who is on “holidays”:
All theorists about the development Of the
tropic North should see Mt. Isa. It' is the proto-
type town for all northern colonisation. It is
in a land whence visitors to mining towns or tne
pre-World-War I era, while conscious ot tne
courage and energy that had gone to the making
of them in the first place, carried away dismal
impressions of galvanised-iron homes, wizened,
heat-struck children and wilted womenfolk, ot
sandv-blight, sores and barcoo rot.
Down the middle of Mt. Isa crawls a mon-
strous range beside a tree-shaded river full o
bird life and jewelled with waterholes. On the
range is the mine, whose face thiows up a
curving sword of lamps at night to meet
stars.' The mine is the meat in the sandwich
of Mt. Isa, which consists of two different
kinds of civic bread. . , , . .
One is the Mt. Isa-mmes brand, created by
the company and nourished by the efforts ot a
community officer. This is the mineside town.
It has been placed in a sheltered valley. It
has been fitted out with all the amenities
civilisation. Here every raineworker has a
dwelling provided according to his or her needs.
Every home is bowered in trees and flowers.
Few are without vegetable gardens. All houses
are electrified. Current is free of cost to th
occupant. Water is laid on. There is a com-
munity store run by the company. Here little
money changes hands. Accounts are the order
of the day and charges are docked from miners
pay There are a community ambulance, medi-
cal attendance, night tennis, bowling greens.
It is the proud boast of women of the mine-
side township that they have the only bowling
green on the continent run entirely by them-
selves without’ a single male finger in the pie.
There is a community hall. Social me is
brighter and is more communal than is known
in the great cities of the south. They are pre-
paring to put in a £20,000 Olympic-standard
swimming pool. .
On the other side of the mine and the river,
hidden from the mineside section, is Mt. Isa
shire township. It is on the model of most
north-west Queensland towns. It is built in-
streets far too wide, running in such a direction
that the prevailing wind howls up them. It
has an old-style sanitary service. It has few
trees and wallows kneedeep in dust. It possesses
all the hotels in the centre. If has no com-
munity hall worth the name. Its shire council
office is a shack. Its hospital is in surround-
ings calculated to make the heart of a patient
sink at the sight of it.
Yet, apparently from the influence of the
civic effort on the mineside, and the adventurous
young blood this has attracted, it is a very
different town from its congener centres, its
hotels are very good by any country standard.
Bottled beer (Fosters’) can be bought tor tne
asking at the bars, which are at present so
well supplied with draught beer that they keep
open till nearly 10 p.m. Drinking is done m
the manner which exists only in memory in the
south. The bars are large and roomy, and set
about with tall stools. There is none ot the
hog-wallow rush which characterises drinking
in Sydney and Newcastle. The stranger notices
the general cleanliness, cheerfulness and selt-
respect of the drinkers and particularly the
cleanliness of their language.
Hotel meals are at pre-war standards and at
pre-war prices. Five shillings’ worth of food
here would cost seven shillings in Sydney
soup, barramundi from Townsville, two entrees,
four or five joints and sweets with cheese form
standard luncheon menus.
The shops in the long mam streets stock
goods which Sydney has not seen for years, for
sale at prices below Sydney prices. For 13s. bd.
I bought a brand and quality of khaki shirt
which cost me 17s. 6d. in Sydney. Mt. Isa has
two sizes in sandshoes, against the one avail-
able in Brisbane and —same brand and type
the price is 7s. 6d. against 10s. 6d. in Brisbane.
Generally speaking living costs appear to be
below Sydney standard, and the big cities have
few worth-while amenities to which Mt. Isa has
not access. And Mt. Isa enjoys what it has
far more than the’ sated populations of the great
wens of the south, as witness the yells of de-
lighted laughter which hurtle up towards the
Milky Way from the serried rows of canvas
chairs in the open (technicolor) picture show.
Most striking of all Mt. Isa’s features, how-
ever, is the change which the provision ot
amenities has wrought in the nature of the
population. Gone the sandy blight and the
barcoo rot; gone the wqedy, heat-struck child-
ren and the faded women. The place is full
of bonny, laughing kids, full of energy and
the joy of life, careering about on bicycles
and showing none of the pallor and enervation
which are supposed to go with life in the tropics.
The men generally are of a high standard.
Australia cannot show a healthier and happier-
looking community than this, or a better-edu-
cated one.
■ Yet 25 years ago this was the wild, with no
signs of human life save a few passing drovers,
kangaroo-shooters and vagrant blacks.
Transport Strangulation.
The first signs of revolt against the
dreadful State transport laws in Australia
are evident in Queensland, where whole-
sale fruit merchants are ignoring the ban
on road delivery of fruit at distances more
than 25 miles from Brisbane markets.
The rebels are supplying fruit to southern
Queensland and northern N.S.W. com-
munities—they can get it to their
customers within three to five hours, com-
pared with up to 24 hours by Govern-
ment train. They have already been
fined more than once, but it is either
carry on and pay fines or go out of busi-
ness.
Brisbane “Courier-Mail” expects a new
Transport Act to come out of the State
Parliamentary session which opened
yesterday, holding that all parties will
support it because “the present law has
militated against the growth of road trans-
port and held back the development of
districts.” Seclions of it had to be sus-
pended during the late strike. And sec-
tions of the N.S.W. transport-strangula-
tion law are about to be suspended be-
cause of Communist larrikinism on the
coalfields, in whose interest and that of
Government railwaymen transport strang-
ulation was devised.
A Sydney Government was the first to
drive an insolvent train through the
“absolutely-free”-transport section of the
Commonwealth Constitution. Other State
Governments followed its lead and there
ensued a sorry history of legalised inter-
ference with road transport. Nowhere
was the rotten thing felt more badly than
in border districts, where Australians who
sought to deliver their own goods in their
own vehicles over their own roads found
themselves bailed up by inspectors with
all the authority of Gestapo officials and
forced to stop their vehicles, sack their
drivers and patronise the slow and care-
less Government railways. Men who had
begun to build up efficient and thriving
goods and passenger-carrying services
had to go out of business. Farmers were
forbidden to carry their livestock to dis-
trict sales across an imaginary border
and to carry bought stock from such sales
back to their farms. Transport of perish-
able goods 50 or 60 miles across country
was also forbidden. They had to be
consigned by rail to some distant junction
and then be shunted back to their desti-
nation, sometimes by then rendered unfit
for sale.
Worst of all, these stupid laws blocked
the development of a great automotive
industry so that when war came this
country of vast distances was badly off
for vehicles, operators, technicians and
workshops. When transport of armies
and their supplies became necessary it
had to be done on a fixed rail system
which radiated out of each capital, had
three gauges, was badly sited for military
transport and was limited to. train
speeds of about 20 miles an hour —every
train held by the one in front of it and
every line subject to dislocation through
flood, accident, industrial dispute or
enemy action.
For military road vehicles Australia
had to depend on harried Britain and
distant U.S.A. and was hard put to it to
get adequate supplies of fuel to run
them. Meantime even the Government-
owned city transport services went to the
bow-wows.
“Labor” politicians gabble about de-
centralisation and the establishment of
secondary industries in rural areas. There
won’t be any worth blowing about unless
the motor vehicle is given its head. There
is a new transport agency in the field, or
rather in the air. Already the narrow-
minded cliques that want to keep the out-
moded railways going are seeking ways
of hamstringing it as they hamstrung the
motor vehicle.
Mass Poisoning.
The proposed scheme for scattering
dingo baits from ’planes over large areas
of pastoral country should be promptly
squashed by the Governments concerned
as a dangerous and quite unpractical ex-
periment, On cattle country in time of
drought it would certainly kill more cattle
than full-grown dingoes. Baits with a
brisket-fat basis would be attractive
to hungry young beasts, and when scat-
tered in the open would be suspect to any
dingo who had reached the age of dis-
cretion. If they are intended particularly
for the pups it would be wasteful to dis-
tribute them all the year round. The
great majority of pups begin to rove early
in May and November respectively, and
if all owners were to bait and trap their
land systematically at these seasons the
pest could be brought under control in a
few years.
There is no doubt that the standard of
intelligence and enterprise among adult
dingoes has risen remarkably within the
last half-century. A five-foot netting
fence deters them no longer, and a really
dingo-proof barrier of welded steel mesh-
ing on steel posts to overcome fire
damage, with barbed-wire tops turned
out for a foot on each side, is beyond
the means of the average pastoralist.
Dingoes avoid traps and set-guns far
more cunningly than did their forebears,
lure-scents do not attract them any more
and the making and laying of an effec-
tive bait has become a far more compli-
cated job. The reason for it all is the
increase in crosses between domestic
breeds of dog and dingo bitches.
A particularly serious aspect of the
foolish proposal is the inevitable and
widespread destruction of bird and reptile
life it would cause. Magpies, butcher-
birds and other useful insectivorous birds
would soon be exterminated over exten-
sive areas with consequent increase of
harmful insect life. Jackasses would no
longer keep the snake population under
regular control, and blowflies would in-
crease from reduction in numbers of
eagles, crows and other carrion-eaters.
Goannas would also be destroyed, and
with them their useful work as carrion-
eaters and destroyers of snakes, scor-
pions and centipedes. Too many of
these valuable allies are already being
killed by present methods of baiting, but
the new proposal will create a serious
situation if it is allowed to operate in the
form at present outlined.

CARRERAS LTD. - OVER 150 YEARS’ REPUTATION FOR QUALITY
POLITICAL POINTS
The Duke of Gloucester is to return
to England at the end of January, when
he wili have fulfilled his intention of
staying two years. He was appointed on
January 30, 1945. Two of the 11 Gov-
emors-General have had shorter actual
terms: the first. Lord Hopetoun, from
January 1, 1901, to July 16, 1902, when
he left Australia, and the second, Lord
Tennyson, from January 9, 1903, to Jan-
uary 21, 1904 —the poet’s son had been
Acting G.-G. for six months after his
predecessor’s departure.
Beasley is to be High Commissioner
in London and Makin Ambassador in
Washington for five years from August 15.
This announcement was made by the P.M.
to a beggarly array of empty benches,
and it looked as if Makin was to be
allowed to leave the House in which he
had sat worthily for 26 years without a
word of appreciation for his services as
member. Speaker and Minister. Archie
Cameron, who has no party feeling where
an old colleague is concerned, objected
so forcibly that a quorum was formed
(a quorum is 28 members, and there were
45 Laborites about, the departing one ex-
cepted) and Makin received the tribute
he had fairly earned. He was obviously
grateful, especially to Cameron, Earle
Page (of the same 1919-20 vintage) and
Dame Enid Lyons, who spoke with real
womanly feeling.
In a large sense it was Dame Enid’s
week at Canberra. The member for
Darwin put it all over Calwell by reading
from a Department of Information
pamphlet full of absurdities in which im-
migrants were informed that they could
begin life in Australia by renting a com-
fortable cottage for five fot 225.
a week. Victorious in the exchanges,
especially with the loutish Mountjoy,
Dame Enid went on to move that
the weekly family endowment should
be paid in respect of the first child,
how excluded. Having a 2-to -1
majority, “Labor” boisterously voted
her down, but “Labor” laughed on
the other side of its mouth when
support for the lady’s proposal, which is
to be carried into the Senate, came from
the A.C.T.U. The A.C.T.U. has presum-
ably been driven to recognise that
Chifley’s tax-cuts discriminate against
family men.
Touching the Evatt claim to an equal
vote for Australia with Russia, France,
Britain and the U.S.A. on the European
peace treaties, it will be awkward if
Molotov quotes Pollard, M.H.R., on
“Labor” policy, to which Evatt is com-
mitted. As Pollard has inconviently re-
called, ‘‘Labor” is still committed to aboli-
tion of the Senate on the ground that it
gives Tasmania and Westralia an equal
voice and vote with Victoria and N. S.
Wales.
“Industry Facing Paralysis” was the
headline served up to Sydney people on
Monday morning in the oldest daily, and
below it were statements that N.S.W.
coal stoppages had caused a production-
loss of 130,000 tons in three weeks, that
railway union bosses feared the effect on
their members, that building and other
industries were “hampered,” that 20,000
were out of work in S.A. and thousands
in Victoria. But there is of course to be
a conference, “a crisis conference,” of
State Ministers and traffic experts, and the
Chifley Coal Industry Bill, with “control”
by a board—subject to the over-riding
instiuctions of Chifley and McKell as in-
struments of union and A.L.P. bosses —
is practically through. Then there is to
be a Miners’ Federation conference, and
doubtless Sharkey, the Communists’
“president,” will telf all hands what he
told a Sydney Domain rally oh Sunday,
organised “to celebrate the 150th anni-
versary of the discovery of coal in Aus-
tralia.”
It is stupid to waste and fritter away
energy on irresponsible stoppages. The
thing to do is to waif for the moment when
it will do most good and strike one power-
ful and co-ordinated blow.
For Stalin or his successor?
In case it may have been forgotten,
there is a “Parliament” in N. S. Wales.
It has been “resting,” but it will resume
business this month to pass the Chifley-
McKell Coal Bill. There may not oe any
coal by then, but there will be race
meetings and lotteries, and, the Chifley-
McKell bill passed, N.S.W. “Labor” will
go forth and support the Chifleys in
Federal constituencies. It won’t say any-
thing about its last legislative achieve-
ment, the Parliamentary Pensions Act,
providing £5 a week for ex-Assemblymen
who have served in three “Parliaments”
and £6 a week for 15-year men, with
£3 a week for their widows, but it won’t
be allowed to get away with silence.
Political parties in the Victorian Par-
liament having passed the buck to one
another, and back to the Cains, the Cains,
in accordance with “ ‘Labor’ principles,”
are passing it on to the electors, who are
once more to be asked *to pass judg-
ment on the liquor business at a poll early
next year. The last senseless shindy cost
the taxpayer £30,000 in direct Govern-
ment expenditure and approximately
£150,000 indirectly in Wet and Dry propa-
ganda. The Licensing Act provides for
a poll every eight years, but- the Dun-
stans ordained that the poll should be
postponed for not more than two years
after the end of the war. Most people
hoped it would be postponed for ever.
The Queensland Industrial Registrar
has refused to register either the Central
Queensland Meat Employees’ Union or
the Bacon Factories Union of Employees,
both breakaways from the M.I.E.U. and
both composed of workers hostile to the
meat, coal and wharf strikes. To the
C.Q.M.E.U. the Registrar said that, having
only 266 members out of 2150 meat-
workers normally employed in the area, it
was not strong enough for registration ; to
the bacon workers, that he was bound by
a decision in a brewery workers’ case in
1938. The Registrar told Neumann,
Queensland secretary of the M.1.E.U.,
that the applications arose from “bitter
resentment” against his. executive over
the strike and that “the’activities of the
union officials in inducing the men to
strike and subsequently in endeavoring
to prevent them returning to work made
sorry reading.” There was more ; but why
should the strike bosses worry? They
held up an entire community, and
emerged scatheless, despite the “victory
for arbitration” claimed by Premier
Hanlon.
Flight-Lieut. R. Raven-Hart, described
as a bearded 57-years-old novelist from
India, sought recruits for a canoe expe-
dition down the Darling and Murray to
S.A. and later on to the Gippsland
Lakes to discover the bunyip. The flight-
lieutenant must have been reading some
of the immigration literature sent out by
Mr. Calwell’s Department of Misinforma-
tion.
Molotov arrived in Paris with three
Balts in his train: alleged Foreign
Ministers of the alleged Soviet republics
of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. His
idea apparently is to claim U.N.O. repre-
sentation for the three alleged Soviet re-
publics—which he won’t get. Britain and
America still refuse to recognise the
Sovietisation of the little countries that
were Russia’s partners in the League and
in non-aggression pacts. League cove-
nants and non-aggression pacts proved as
incapable of restraining Soviet imperi-
alism as reeds that bend to the winds.
If Molotov’s dummies from the Baltic
States venture into the British zone in
Germany they will find there 160,000
Balts who would rather live out their
blighted lives in displaced persons’ camps
than enjoy the blessings of Communism
in their native land. There was a refer-
ence to the martyrdom of the Balts in
the case of a Lithuanian Jew Who died
in Sydney leaving £30,000 to be divided
among 13 nephews and nieces. Five have
been lost in Lithuania, their fate hidden
behind the iron curtain; eight, news-
paper reports said, “managed to get away
to Sydney shortly before the German in-
vasion which preceded the occupation by
the Red Army.” “Preceded” is wrong.
The Red Army overran the Baltic States
over a year before it fell back before
the Germans. That rapid movement be-
gan on June 22, 1941 ; in July, 1940, the
Red Army had its guns trained on the
Balts, who, thus persuaded, voted Latvia,
Lithuania and Estonia into the U.S.S.R.
By all accounts the most sumptuous
lunches and afternoon teas to be sur-
veyed in Sydney are spread before mem-
bers and guests of “Labor’s” Turf Club,
which has plans for a grand new race-
course with gorgeous buildings—and
Treasury backing if anything goes wrong
with the finances, thus far undisclosed.
No worker can expect to become a mem-
ber of “Labor’s” Turf Club, membership
being restricted to the new rich, and a
glimpse at any of the sumptuous lunches
or afternoon teas would send any in-
valided Digger from Kure off his rocker.
But no sight of the vulgar ostentation of
the new rich would be vouchsafed to any
such person.
In a social survey of Victorian country
towns, made by A. J. and J. J. Mclntyre
(with Melbourne University’s blessing),
and very well done, it is recorded that
“there is no country town without its
s.-p. bookie, and usually there are a
good many more than one. In one small
town* population 500, the bookie is re-
puted to make £2OOO a year and to be
the wealthiest man in town.” The Mc-
Intyres collected some bitter local objec-
tions :
A solicitor said “About half the debt
cases I have t'o deal with are the result of
betting” “People are going without ne-
cessities because they spend their money
in betting” “The baker and butcher boys
tout for the bookies, and the women think
of nothing else.”
In four States with “Labor” Govern-
ments the lottery craze co-exists with the
s.-p. craze. The effect of both is to make
people credulous, thriftless, reckless and
poor; but “Labor” doesn’t care.
N.S.W. “Labor” was wounded to the
—er —soul when its favorite boxer, who
did all his war service within easy travel-
ling distance of the Stadium, refused a
match in Melbourne because of the state
of Sydney:-
There are so many bashers and thugs
• about at present that I would not risk my
wife and young children, even for one
night.
Under extreme pressure the ingrate with-
drew his objection, but the sting remains.
South Australia, the one State with a
Liberal Government, is also the one State
in which Ministerial work is really grow-
ing so fast as to have made an additional
Minister a necessity. There are only six
Ministers, the same as in 1908. There
are nine in Tasmania and Westralia, ten
in Queensland, 12 in Victoria and 16 in
N. S. Wales. The Tasmanian nine must
be a world’s record for blatant and
ridiculous excess. There is a Minister to
every 3600 of population of both sexes
and all ages and conditions; and only
provincial matters to attend to. A
“Labor” country, of course.
When the Government at Wellington
(M.L.) sent a defeated Labor candidate
to Moscow as Minister it talked blithely
of trade possibilities. Trade has been
confined to imports of “literature” from
Russia, valued at £142 10s.; exports (15
months) were nil. The Minister is re-
quired to furnish a monthly report to his
Government. The cost of these lucu-
brations is dryly reckoned by the
“Dominion” as £2400 a report.
From “Colbun”: —
Victoria and N. S. Wales had feminine can-
didates for the Senate as far back as 1903.
Queensland’s first is Miss Annabelle J. M.
Rankin, one of the Liberal-C.P. trio. Of attrac-
tive appearance, and with a real gift of elo-
Sience, she has done a great deal of philan-
ropic work for women and children in Queens-
land. She aims at improving their lot all over
post-war Australia, particularly that of the young
wives, widows, children and orphans of ex-
servicemen, and she considers that the Senate
is the most hopeful place from which to attain
it. Judging from the enthusiastic reception given
to her opening address by the largest audience
seen at any political meeting in Maryborough
for years, she will receive strong polling sup-
port, particularly in the Burnett district.
Calwell only did half a job in going
back for immigration propaganda to pre-
war prices for his cost-of-living figures.
He should have gone back to 1847. In
that year some of the principal dining
houses in Bridge-street, Ballarat, reduced
the charge for dinner to sixpence, offer-
ing roast turkey at that price. An edi-
torial comment in Melbourne was that
sixpence had been a common charge for
years in Bourke-street.
Twitted by motoring organisations with
the uselessness of petrol rationing at an
administrative cost of £20,000 a month,
Supply Minister Ashley said his “Gov-
ernment” wouldn’t lift rationing until it
was ready. He had earlier given figures
which showed that the average motorist
was now using as much petrol as in 1939.
There followed a short silence ; then, with
September 28 announced as the election
date, Ashley’s leader said that “further
consideration” would be “given to the
early lifting of petrol rationing.” Ashley,
who hasn’t to go up for election, silently
concurred.
In the course of the Coal Industry Bill
debate Ward said that while he was
Minister of Labor about 90 per cent, of
disputes were the fault of the owners.
The man is slipping ; 12 months ago he
would have put the percentage at 101.
Martens, the people’s chosen repre-
sentative for Herbert (till Sept. 28), has
added his name to the Wards, Calwells,
Rugby League footballers, Stadium
“fans” and ill-mannered tennis players
who abuse the referee when a decision
goes against them or their mates. Criti-
cising the Davidson report, he remarked
that if the mine-owners had appointed
the Judge and told him what to say he
could not have done the job better. Ac-
cording to the Martens school a Royal
Commission that does not give the type
of report the Government wants has
failed in its duty.
Tired of seeing his State stuck up by
N.S.W. coalminers, Victorian Premier
Cain proposes to “nationalise” gas pro-
duction and distribution. Gas companies
and their staffs are guiltless of sticking up
the State, but that is a detail; in any
case, the average “Labor” Premier is no
whale on logic. Costly apparatus is to
be erected at Yallourn so that brown
coal may be turned into gas at the point
of production, and costly pipelines will
be necessary to ferry the stuff to Mel-
bourne and other towns. When the whole
thing is set up there will be a compli-
cated system for Communist-controlled
unions to hold up when they feel an in-
clination in that direction, as they’ve held
up housing.
Liberal-leader Hollway says the gas-
nationalisation” plan has been brought
in at the behest of the Communist-con-
trolled Miners’ Federation and that it
will merely transfer industrial lawless-
ness from the N.S.W. coalmines to Vic-
toria, where there was a strike recently
on the Government-owned coalmine at
Wonthaggi. According to Hollway, all
Cain is trying to do with his “nationalisa-
tion” is to buy a fight with the Upper
House as a pre-election dodge, and as
there are only seven Labor members in
that House the scheme hasn’t an earthly
chance of being legislated.

“AND IT'S PRINTED WITH WIMBLES INKS”
Hillbilly”; Hero of a story in my
Sunday newspaper is Bill, a wounded
veteran from New Guinea. “Maybe I’m
not the guy she thought I was,” says
Bill, referring to his girl, “I’ll go see her.”
When he tries to see her he finds the
elevator” out of order. His prospective
pa-in-law, whose name is Hamus, offers
him “twenty grand” to put a crook deal
over old “Cyrus G. Thorndyke.” Bill
struggles with his conscience in a “soda
joint on the corner.” It would all be
understandable were it not that the illus-
trations show Bill in unmistakeable A.I.F.
uniform, with Rising Sun on collar and
Australias” on his shoulders. I thought
the illustrator might have made a mistake,
but was assured by those who should
know that the locale of the story is
Sydney. I’ve never been there myself,
but always understood that town was in
N.S.W.
“Uco”: If those searchers for a copy
of the symbolic figure of Justice (“More-
head,” B. 17/7/*46) had gone to the
author of a recent short-story in my even-
ing paper he’d have put them a long way
off the track. Describing a carved
statuette of Justice, he wrote “....the
eyes were of emerald, yet seemed to
hold depths of understanding, fearless.
Lightly poised, with arms outflung, her
perfection surpassed reality.” Apparently
Justice is no longer blindfolded and she
has thrown away her scales and sword.

“Ex-Mister”: Tragedy marked the last'
run of the Queensland Government
steamer Otter, condemned after 62 years’
service to Rotten Row. Her skipper.
Captain Thrower, dressed the old ship in
full bunting so that she might go out of
service with colors flying. Sirens
screeched farewells as she left the Bris-
bane wharf for Dunwich, on Stradbroke
Island, and handkerchiefs fluttered from
riverside houses as she made her way
downstream. As she came alongside at
Dunwich wharf the waiting people
seemed strangely silent. A message was
handed to Captain Thrower. His wife,
inmate of a Brisbane hospital, had died
suddenly while the ship was on her way.
The Otter completed her last voyage with
her flags half-mast, saddest of all bunting
a ship can wear.

“X.S,”: Melbourne “Herald” has been
delving into natural history. It discovered
a pigeon which had been caught behind
wire-netting at the top of professional
buildings in Collins-street, and a photo,
allegedly depicted the imprisoned crea-
ture fluttering against its bars while free
members of its tribe fed it through the
wires. There was a strong demand for ‘
immediate release of the bird from its
confinement, with offers of financial aid
to organise a rescue party equipped with
fire-brigade ladders. It then turned out
that the crevice had been the retreat of
upwards of 250 pigeons whose insanitary
habits had become a nuisance. They had
been driven out and the exit closed, but
on© had been missed, though it had been
released later, incidentally before the
photo, was taken. The birds which had
been credited with the instincts of good
Samaritans were actually trying, as
pigeons do, to get back to their nests.

“H. Hardupp”: In former days it had
been the open scullery of the old house to
which it belonged ; the removal of the
copper and tubs, the building of a wall
with a door and window let in, fibro
roofing and a wooden floor had con-
verted it into a “garden flat” —the garden
being a few ferns and staghorns on the
fence and some straggling plants facing
the door. A little outhouse had been
associated with the former scullery, but,
the amenity having been removed to the
bathroom, the cupboardlike recess had
become a “separate kitchenette.” The
home-viewer snapped up this curious
dug-out— at a rental for which a decent
bungalow would have been expected 20
years ago.

“Ramac”: The first 829 we saw over
Haisho prison camp was responsible
for the death of one innocent Chinese
citizen. We were making a road near
the town when the alarm wailed, and we
sprinted for shelter. Crowding around
the entrance, we could see the huge bird
ignoring the Jap flak and apparently
“Did you run into something?”
picking out a spot to lay her eggs. She
seemed to be awfully close, and the noise
of her engines was deafening. Hoot Mc-
Gloot, our Taiwan guard, decided to
bring her down with his rifle. He took
aim and fired —just as a panic-stricken
local hurled across the line of vision. The
Superfort, disliking the ground barrage—
not Hoot’s —climbed and disappeared sea-
wards.

“R.H.P.”: I nominate “only” as the
most ill-treated word in the English lan-
guage (B. 17/7/’46). Disregarding actual
conversation, examine closely any sen-
tence, either in letters or books, in which
the unfortunate word appears. In nine
times out of 10 you will find it wrongly
placed. I only add this last sentence as
a typical example of its misuse.

“Clio”: Apart from architectural merit
The Rangers, Mosman (B. 17/7/’46), de-
served preservation because of the fine
marine fresco painted on one of its walls
by Oswald Brierley. The Rangers was not
the only Sydney replica of an English
Gothic manor house to be demolished.
Barnstaple Manor, Drummoyne, the
home of the Rodd family, disap-
peared in the early 1930’5. A ram-
bling building with lovely twisted chim-
neys of stone, a gable with waterworn
pebbles let into its wall in lozenge form,
it might have been lifted bodily from
some English county. We ought to follow
the example of the Swedes and institute
a “village of history” for notable speci-
mens of architecture that have to be
shifted from their original positions.

“Sach”: It is a new racket. He is a
well-dressed young man of good appear-
ance, his story is simple, well told and has
a sincere ring. It follows these lines:
A few hours ago he came in by the Bris-
bane express; cloaked his bags; had a
meal; suddenly found that he had lost
his wallet; has only 3d. left in small
change. He knows no one in this strange
city, but is destined for Parramatta. The
fare is Is. lOd. If you could lend him
Is. 7d. he would be eternally obliged.
He accepts two or three bob gratefully,
insists on giving you the address of his
friends and asks for your address so that
he may return the money. You go away
with a warm feeling, conscious that you
have done a bit of good for your State
by showing a visitor that it is not in-
habited by a lot of heartless morons.
You don’t feel so good when you
learn that a lot of your friends have
been “touched” in exactly the same way.
Those small sums mount up.

“Col. Dark”: Adelaide “Advertiser”
recently published a message from a
farmer in Victoria who had in his pos-
session a ten-shilling note inscribed
“Come back to me,” and the name, num-
ber and unit of a South Australian
soldier. The columnist commented that
the farmer would like to get in touch
with the soldier. So would the Com-
monwealth Treasury; mutilating or dis-
figuring Commonwealth notes is an
offence carrying a heavy penalty.

“Trebor”: Antique furniture can still
be picked up in England (“F.5.,” B.
24/7/’46), but there are pitfalls. One
evening in war-time London I struck up
a conversation with a man I had recog-
nised as having seen playing the Emperor
in a suburban pantomime. He had two
sidelines—he ghosted for a woman
painter, and he was “toucher-up” for an
antique-faker who specialised in whatnots
and corner-pieces of the Jacobean period.
Suitable pieces were cleared of all traces
of varnish and stain, and immersed in a
repulsive compost of Thames mud for a
couple of weeks. Taken out and washed
they retained ingrained dirt in surface
cracks and flaws, and when painted with
a whitewash gave a suitable base upon
which my friend painted his designs. The
fakes were then varnished, and the
varnish subjected to a cracking process
to simulate the cracked surface of a
genuine antique. Dealers bought them as
good fakes and sold them to gullible
clients.

“Craiser”; There is a faint tinge of
snobbery about Rehabilitation. A scien-
tist who paid his university fees as a
student by carting stone in a council
quarry, and who farms in his spare time,
rang up Rehab, and asked for a man to
help with his agriculture. Said the offi-
cial: “I suppose you want the officer
type, sir?”

“Miss X.”: The dithery female who
tries to liquidate her overdraft with one
of her own cheques is well known to the
banking fraternity, but a teller cobber of
mine reports a finer development of the
character. After the bank had patiently
explained to her the intricacies of high
finance, she withdrew very bewildered
and slightly offended. A few days later
the bank received a short, cold note from
the lady enclosing the few pounds she had
overdrawn and explaining that, since the
bank wouldn’t cash her cheque, she had
tendered it to the butcher, “who was
only too pleased to oblige.”

“V. Cluse”; As is the way of Sydney
tram travellers, the elderly lady made to
leave the tram on the wrong side, and
Jephson and another just managed to
snatch her from the path of an oncoming
lorry. “You ought to have more sense,”
panted Jephson, in a mixture of shock
and anger. “There’s only one side to leave
a tram and that’s the left side.” The
rescued one appeared to be suitably
impressed and Jephson launched forth
on a condemnation of the general habits
of tram travellers. He pointed out that
in other cities there were penalties for
leaving trams on the wrong side, and that
the trams themselves were fitted with
barriers to prevent it. “It’s no wonder
people get laid out,” he wound up. “They
ask for it. Ducking out on the wrong
side might save a second or two and
put you in the hospital or the cemetery.
Many a man would be alive today if”
He broke off, gasped, “Gosh, this is my
stop,” dived from the tram on the wrong
side, just missed being skittled by a taxi,
leapt to the kerb and, glaring after the
taxi, muttered, “Ruddy fool. Some of
these blokes should never be licensed.”

“Norther”: According to the male
party in a recent court case, Queensland
has a woman who doesn’t miss when she
starts throwing things. Her somewhat
dubious spouse pronounced her “the best
crockery shot in town.” He was so con-
vinced of her accuracy that he took an
axe to bed, though whether to fend off
the missiles or intimidate the artillerist
wasn’t stated. Anyhow, he was ordered
to maintain the shooter of china-ware
and their offspring.

“Pitt St.”: I like Calwell! He is the
kind of Minister who turns on the
kind of effrontery that stifles criticism.
Dame Enid Lyons, who has reared 11
children, quoted from a Calwell pam-
phlet issued to prospective immigrants
which gave a list of the bargains await-
ing them in Australia; a comfortable
house for five people at 225. a week;
oranges at each; peas at Bd. per
pound; a woman’s best shoes 255.
Bd., ordinary shoes 18s. lid., and so on.
Generalising, the author stated that a
wife could be clothed for £l2 Bs. 2d. a
year, a boy of 10 for £9 18s. 4d. and a
girl of seven for £8 19s. Cal well’s answer
was that if the Australian people sup-
ported his Government such things would
be by the time the immigrants got here.
Yes, I like Calwell —he makes me laugh
and not many politicians do that.

“Wigwag”; As the troopship came in to
dock the boys were pleasantly surprised
to see a band there to welcome them.
Even more surprising was the sight of
the wharlies lifting up placards. “Wel-
come home?” No —the legend was
“Any cigarette papers?”

“Findy”: “Reffo” (B. 24/7/’46) came
into use in the late ’thirties as a designation
for European refugees, particularly Jews.
The “o” suffix seems to be a favorite
N.S.W. device for the coining of new
words. When I came to Sydney from
Adelaide about 12 years ago “susso” for
sustenance money or the dole and
“compo” for workmen’s compensation
were new to my ears. “Arvo” (afternoon)
I had picked up from Ginger Meggs.
“Reo” (reinforcement) had to wait for
the war; I didn’t hear it till I became
one.

“Salmon Gums”: Perth is having a
spate of hit-and-run accidents. The demon
drink, blamed for the sorry state of
affairs, probably has something to do
with the hitting, but cynics aver that the
running is mostly attributable to the lady
passenger, who usually isn’t the driver’s
wife. But there are signs that culprits
are developing consciences. The latest,
after striking a parked vehicle, left a quid
and a note to say that it would cover the
damage. The note was anonymous.

“Nakhoda”: Indian litigation has been
noted for some long-drawn-out and com-
plicated cases, but none has equalled the
case in which the Privy Council decided
that an Indian who had roamed the coun-
try as a coolie for 12 years was in fact
the rightful Rajah Kumah Ramendra
Narayan Roy, heir to a principality with
a revenue of £lOO,OOO and an area larger
than England. His wife, the Ranee, de-
clared that she had seen her hus-
band carried off to the funeral pyre to
be incinerated. He claimed that he was
in a trance on the occasion, the trance-
like state being the perquisite of the
yogi. When the bearers laid down the
bier for a breather the rajah recovered
his consciousness and walked off. Sub-
sequently, when he returned from the
dead, his alleged widow, having married
again, refused to recognise him. Over
1500 witnesses were heard in the process,
the printed records totalled over a mil-
lion words and the fees of the gent, ones,
mainly Hindus, absorbed a year of the
rajah’s income. And he was dead in five
days!

“Gravelsnatcher”; Impersonations and
unlucky choice (B. 17/7/’46)? A chap
called at the Port Melbourne office of the
Seamen’s Union and, explaining that he
was Tom Starcevich, the Westralian
V.C., asked about the prospects of a job.
He had no discharge papers, but he was
so obviously the real thing—he wore a
uniform with a captain’s three pips, a dis-
guise which a discharged private might
well be expected to assume —that form-
alities were waived. Unfortunately one
of those prying newshounds got on to
the story and cabled it west. Before the
ink was really dry the imposition had
been discovered and that news was
bouncing back to Melbourne, where
union officials, described as
awaited unavailingly the impostors
return.
SLIGHTED SENATORS.
“Senators of all parties complain bitterly that the
House of Reps, is getting more than its share of the
Parliamentary broadcasting.”
Persistently they fume and fret
Because they’re not allowed to get
What should be theirs, it’s safe to bet,
By any tenet
Of treatment reckoned just and fair
Their whack of time upon the air.
Here is a slight that’s hard to bear,
Asserts the Senate.
Like gems of purest ray serene
That glow where no one’s ever been,
Like flowers that needs must blush unseen
Where none remarks them,
So, it’s presumably inferred,
Their eloquence must go unheard
By way of 2BL. My word!
Of course it narks them.
Are we not losers, too/in this?
What sparkling repartee we miss,
What clear and cold analysis
Must go unanswered.
What bright and memorable jeux
D esprit are wasted unless you
Get—what, worse luck, I never do —
A squint at Hansard.
Scant wonder that they make a fuss.
Our Elder Statesmen, muzzled thus,
And in a mood obstreperous
Rise to demand a
Fair chance to furnish radio stuff,
Rightly regarding it as rough
To be denied their quantum suff .
Of propaganda.
For Senators no less than Reps.
Must vigilantly watch their steps,
And spruik the tack that stirs and peps
All who may ask it,
Especially in the event
Of an election imminent
With dismal risks of being sent
Into the basket.

“Bo”: A V 2 rocket that was sent up
106 miles into the “outer stratosphere”
before flattening out for its journey dis-
placed in the process quite a heap of hot
air, the burden of which was that before
long trips to the moon would be a strong
probability. Apart from the fact that
they’ve only to get enough fuel into the
rocket to go the bare 239,000-odd more
miles —which sounds rather like the old-
time Salv’army captain’s request for “only
elevenpence ha’penny more to make a
bob” —the scientists are practically sitting
on the lunar canals. One astronomer has
even voiced the possibility of extracting
wealth from our satellite. It may, of
course, be eventually won, so possible has
become the impossible in this scientific
age. All the same, I’ll lay a shade of
odds they don’t take out of the “pale-
faced moon” a fraction of the wealth Tin-
pan-alley song writers have made out of
rhyming “moonlight” with “June night.”

“Pab D.”: Usually I can negotiate the
jungle of Sydney with reasonable speed,
but last Sunday I walked with my five-
year-old son from Wynyard via the G.P.O.
to Circular Quay, less than half a mile.
The trek took half an hour. Reason:
Sydney’s hordes of street photographers
who lie in wait on every corner in the
portals of almost every sizeable building.
If you’re alone you have some chance of
passing them; if you’re with a popsy
there’s still a slight hope ; but if you’re
with a kid you’re sunk. By the time I
reached the Quay I had missed my ferry,
had a cranky kid on my hands and 14
photographers’ cards in my pocket. The
last fellow who leaped from behind a
post on the ferry wharf will never know
how close he came to sudden death.

“Oliver Filter”: I’m still wearing uni-
form because the tailor hasn’t finished my
civvy suit yet, but in all other ways I’m
back to the rigors of civilian life. A few
days ago I paid a bob for an ounce of
“our Saturday morning special,” and
yesterday I built a smoke from it. After
I’d taken a few draws, my room-mate de-
parted, asking me to let him know when
I’d finished fumigating the place. Before
“ I Wonder would the policeman mind keeping my place while I get a
Wet set ?”
I’d finished half the gasper I was con-
vinced that the “Saturday morning
special” was a mixture of chopped-up
hair from an unwashed dog, leather
scrapings, filterings from a vacuum
cleaner, plus a pinch of gunpowder to
make it burn. I swore off the stuff, but
packed some in a tin and took it to the
pub where I have my evening noggin, and
which is haunted by the most persistent
cigarette bot on record. I handed him
the tin when, he came on his rounds and
he rolled himself a week-ender. I watched
him light it, anticipating that, at least, he
would immediately ditch it, or, at me
most, abuse me for trying to poison hum
But he took a few long, luxurious draws,
gave a happy smile and said, ‘ Thanks,
mate. It’s good to get a decent smoke.
You blokes in uniform get all the best
tobacco.” .

“Dick Tafone”: Luck certainly does
go to a lot of trouble in chasing some
people. A Brisbane punter buying a
lottery ticket at his usual agency was
told by the salesgirl that he had won a
fiver in the previous drawing. Finding
the ticket after a search of pockets and
odd papers, he decided to use the money
in buying a full book of the articles.
Only a half-book was left in stock, and
he took it. Learning that the other half
had been bought by a friend, he offered
to buy it, or, alternatively, to go fifty-
fifty on any prizes. The friend couldn t
manage either, as he had bought it for a
syndicate. At the next drawing the
punter’s half-book yielded the ticket
which won second prize of £lOOO.

“Clooter”; The fascination of sitting a
little white ball on the ground and trying
to hh it 100 yards or so towards a distant
flag has lifted golf into the most popular
of all outdoor pastimes. More _and
more people are playing it, and there
is a vast and growing industry in the
manufacture and sale of bags, clubs, tees
and the various clothing “accessories.
Ball-makers, short of labor and materials,
must be spitting with baffled fury over
their inability to supply the howling de-
mand. Every golf club has a long list ot
prospective members, and the conductors
of public courses find it almost impossible
to cope with the demand for playing
times. Personally, I’m pleased about it,
for golf is a healthy exercise, giving
physical and mental recreation and, after *
the initial expenses, is as cheap a pastime
as any. In Sydney at the moment there
is a wail from golf “authorities,” egged
on by sporting writers, about people who
cheat or abuse the etiquette of the game,
but it is one of the good points of golf
that the player who does either cheats
only himself. An individual game, in
which the onus is on the player all the
time, golf shows a man to himself in his
true colors and only utter fools get away
with breaches,

“Stone”: Recent reference to rare
Australian books reminds me that the
author of Sydney’s first novel remains
unidentified. The Guardian : A Tale by
an Australian was published in 1838 by
James Spilsbury. The 406 pages of melo-
dramatic story set in England and Wales
passed unnoticed and unadvertised in the
local press of the day. The allusions to
Botany Bay and its people were uncom-
plimentary, and included the “songless
birds and scentless flowers” libel. In-
quiries at public libraries, here and
abroad, have yielded no clue as to the
identity of An Australian.
“Uramao”: A rarity has come the way
of Turnbull Library, Wellington (MX.)—
a first euition of Melville’s Moby Dick.
Book collectors in U.S.A. have their optics
skinned for this work, as only 5Uu ot me
first edition were run off.

Jimn : That raid on the Monk y
smugglers recalls that smuggling
popular m the penal times. One J
Sydney’s o dest buildings the octagonal
towerlike building on the K S “ R „ V
La Perouse, overlooking Botany B
entrance, was Macquarie s gesture to con-
traband runners in his day. Botany was
then well away from the official eye, and
the goods were being brought in over
the bush tracks to Sydney. The Hawkes-
bury mouth was likewise well off the
beaten track, but it is doubtful if the
watch at that port worried the more wide-
awake smuggler. The dummy figure of
a scarlet-coated soldier was rigged up on
the cliff face at Barrenjoey, together with
a light, filled at intervals with whale oil
by a visiting guard, to scare off would-be
night-runners. Only in recent years has
“No, no! When you fall you must show BOTH your million-dollar
legs. Miss Padem.”
the wooden framework of that dummy
guard finally disintegrated, but the La
Perouse watch-tower is remarkably well
preserved and is in use as a war-veterans’
home.

“Yokel”: “Viz’s” remarks about
phonetic spelling (B. 17/7/’46) got me
thinking about Esperanto. A sensible,
compact, easy-to-learn language it cer-
tainly is, and after I had learnt it I won-
dered why the business and diplomatic
world hadn’t welcomed it with open arms.
A much-travelled friend provided me with
the answer. The drawback to its progress
lies not in the language itself, but in the
people who peddle it. Esperanto enthusi-
asts are —by their very enthusiasm
hindrances to the language’s progress.
Keen Esperantists talk and think of
nothing but Esperanto, and the most
oblique reference to their pet subject sets
them off on a long harangue about its
virtues, its progressiveness and its neces-
sity to a world bewildered by conflicting
tongues. In short, Esperantists talk you
into believing in Esperanto, and before
you have a chance to become really
enthusiastic about it, they talk you out of
it again - * * *

“Fitz”: Between the wars, the Aus-
tralian short-story writer stooa as lUucu
chance of selling a collection of his yarns
to local publishers as a hotdog merchant
had of setting up his stall at the entrance
to the Hotel Australia. Only such as
Vance Palmer and Katharine Susannah
Prichard were able to break down the
prejudice, and, if I remember rightly,
their collections were published in
London. Since 1940, however, there
has been a crop of short stories
in book form issued by various
Australian publishers, the work of
Frank Dalby Davison, Cecil Mann,
Douglas Stewart, Gavin Casey, Marjorie
Barnard, Don Edwards, Charles Shaw,
Margaret Trist, Brian James, J. B.
Katharine Susannah Prichard, Alan Mar-
shall, Stanley Brogden, Harold Mercer,
A C Headley, John K. Ewers, Peter
Cowan, G. C. Bleeck and R. S. Porteous
(“Standby”). In addition there have been
the four annual Coast to Coast antholo-
gies and a couple of others. The Bulle-
tin’s “Red Page” writer can probably
explain the sudden popularity of the Aus-
tralian storyteller in his own country. L
am inclined to the theory that demand
for war-time reading that didn t require a
month of Sundays to get through is the
main reason.

“Hamer”: Watching some small boys
“picking” cars stirred a memory. The
kids vied in efforts to be the first to name
the passing cars. During a period of my
childhood spent near Woolwich (Eng-
land), we kids used to play a similar
game with soldiers, who in the colorful
uniform of the times were as thick as
blackberries thereabouts. Better than
the game, which was an everyday sport,
were the periodical reviews at Woolwich
itself. The highlight of those came with
the stentorian order “Pre-pare to receive
cav-al-ray!” There was a great galloping
of horses and a shouting of orders as
the heads of each unit received the orders
from the gallopers; and in a couple of
minutes the troops were aligned in that
glory of old military tradition the British
square, a dazzle of brilliant-hued uniforms
on the green common,

“Redfern”: The present-day hair-
dressing saloon with its expanse of gleam-
ing mirrors, polished oak, stainless steel
and white enamelled chairs is no doubt
more pleasing to the eye than the old-
time barber’s shop; but I retain a
sneaking regard for the joints where my
hair was cut when I was a nipper. In
those far-off days every second saloon
was a miniature art gallery. One shop
in an industrial suburb where I had my
locks shorn managed to find space on its
walls for oleographs of half a dozen
crowned heads of European countries ;
colored prints of two Italian dread-
noughts, the Conte di Cavour and Giulo
Cesare ; photographs of cricketers, boxers,
sculling champions, racehorses and
cyclists. There were two large framed
charts of cricket and turf records, and
another chart showing about a dozen
different styles of beards. There were also
prints of the battle-pictures beloved by
our grandparents, and photographs of
the local football and cricket teams. An
illuminated address, a stuffed fish and a
parrot in a cage completed the display.
Inartistic as it all was, I think it pre-
ferable to the cardboard cut-outs of
self-conscious damsels reclining in deck-
chairs puffing So and So’s cigs.

“Q. 1.8.” (S.’Africa): In the Boer War
the heliograph was an important method
of communication. At the battle of Rheno-
ster Kop we were advancing on the Boer
position, a very strong one. Viljoen,
the Boer commander, helio’d a message
which for some time we could not under-
stand. It read “Bring on your some-
thing colonials.” It was repeated ; the
word we could not read was “bloody.’
With the aid of Imperial Yeomanry,
heavy guns and a crowd of Aussies we
beat Viljoen out of his position, the Boers
lost a lot of men and were glad to retire.
That was the first time a cuss word was
helio’d on active service.

THE SERVICE MAN
Grand Men All.
Oliver Filter”: A tardy official tri-
bute has been paid to a gallant band of
14 Australians and Englishmen who
raided Singapore Harbor in September,
1943.
The party belonged to the Special
Raiding Detachment of the Allied Intelli-
gence Bureau; “the cloak and dagger
boys.” A. 1.8. was created early in 1942.
By. use of aircraft, ship and submarine,
it established and maintained a network
of agents far behind the enemy lines in
New Guinea, the Philippines, the N.E.I.
and Malaya, and provided G.H.Q. with a
stream of invaluable information.
Destruction was the particular job of
S.R.D., and the Singapore men chosen
for the raid trained hard and long in
Australia, one rehearsal scaring the
wits out of Townsville people, before
leaving on their 2000-mile voyage. A
submarine took them most of the way
through the enemy-patrolled waters. They
transhipped to a Malayan dhow and,
finally, to a rowing boat.
Having gone from peril to peril, they
established themselves on an island near
Singapore harbor and watched the place
for “several days” until the pickings
looked good. Then, on the night of
September 26, 1943, they crept into the
harbor, fixed mines and fire bombs to a
selection of Jap ships, and crept out again.
* Nothing was left undone to make the
hazardous job effective, and effective it
was. The explosion destroyed by' fire or
sinking seven of Nippon’s freighters and
tankers—37,ooo tons altogether—and left
the Japs panic-stricken, disorganised and
mystified.
Their mission accomplished, the raiders
set out on their return voyage through
enemy-patrolled waters. Of this little has
been said, but it was made—though not
all the way by rowboat —and Australia
was reached on October 19, 1943. The
lads had spent 40 days in enemy-occupied
territory. They were led by Lt.-Colonel
(then Captain) Iven Lyon, M.8.E., who
had fought the Japs down through Malaya
with the Gordon Highlanders and escaped
after the fall of Singapore.
The lieut.-colonel was awarded the
D.S.O. The officers and men with him
and the awards they received were
Lt.-Commander (then Lieut.) D. N.
Davidson, R.N.V.R., D. 5.0.; Captain
(then Lieut.) R. C. Page, A.I.F. (N.S.W.),
D. 5.0.; Lieut. H. C. Carse, R.A.N.V.R.
(N.S.W.), M.1.D.; Cpl. R. G. Morris,
R. M.M.; Cpl. A. Crilly, A.I.F.
(Q.), M.M,; Leading-Stoker J. P. Mc-
Dowell, R.N., D.S.M.; A.B. A. W. Falls,
RAN. (N.S.W.), D.S.M.; Acting A.B.
A. W. Jones, R.A.N. (W.A.), D.S.M.;
A.B. A. W. Huston, R.A.N. (Q), D.S.M.;
Leading Seaman K. P. Cain, R.A.N.
(Q.), M.1.D,; Leading Telegraphist H. S.
Young, R.A.N. (N.S.W.), M.1.D.; A.B.
F. W. Marsh, R.A.N. (Q.), M.1.D.; and
A.B. M. Berryman, RA N. (S.A.), M.I.D,
The pattern of the Singapore raid was
repeated three times on other operations.
Tragically, on the third occasion Lt.-
Colonel Lyon, Lt.-Commander Davidson,
Captain Page and Able Seamen Falls,
Huston and Marsh were captured in 1944
and barbarously executed. The workings
of the Japanese mind are such that the
heroism of the captives was extolled by
their murderers to Japanese troops in a
special order-of-the-day. Their decora-
tions had received Royal approval, but
they died without knowing it.
Captain Page was a nephew of Dr.
Earle Page, sometime Treasurer and
Prime Minister. A medical student when
war was declared, he could have con-
tinued his studies had he chosen, but he
elected to serve. He was in the Middle
East with the Sixth Division. On its
return to Australia he joined the Com-
mandos and went from them to the
S. missions. He carried to further
fame a name already enhanced by his
father, Harold Hillis Page, who, an officer
of the 25th Battalion in World War I,
was thrice wounded and thrice mentioned
in dispatches, and came out with the
D.S.O. and M.C.
Harold Page had been a clerk
in the Commonwealth public service, and
after the war he went to New Guinea,
becoming Government Secretary and
Assistant Administrator. He was cap-
tured when the Japanese took Rabaul.
With others of the official staff and many
Diggers he was lost when the Monte-
video Maru was torpedoed. Of that
tragedy Australia has learned all too
little from Canberra, which has chosen to
be reticent concerning all the calamities
that occurred in the islands —notably
Java, Amboina and Timor when
“Labor” was Saving the Country.
It is one of the greatest tragedies of
war that so many only sons perish, and
with them names and families that
no country can afford to lose. The only
son of Sergeant Brown, V.C., D.C.M.,
died two years after his father went out
into the night carrying grenades to meet
the victory-exultant Japanese on Singa-
pore. Captain R. C. Page was the only
son in a family of four. He left a young
widow.
Jap Gadgets in N.G.
“Jemac”; New Jap war devices are
regularly coming to light with the unearth-
ing of ammunition dumps round Rabaul.
Among the usual suicide boats and
human torpedoes are gadgets which in
their ingenious simplicity were probably
more effective than either.
There was a 30ft. bamboo pole,
weighted at one end, with half a dozen
beer bottles filled with fuel oil lashed
round it about two-thirds of the way up.
On top of the pole was set a mirror. The
contraption was intended to be laid like
a dan buoy at sea, floating upright with
the bottles’ buoyancy. A spotting aircraft
would bomb the “periscope”; and on
the evidence of spreading fuel oil one
Jap submarine would be deducted from
enemy strength.
Another clever arrangement was a 4ft.-
by-2ft. steel box similar to one swept up
some time ago in Torres Strait by a
minesweeper. Inside it was mechanism
much the same in appearance as a wire-
less set. Lying in the pressured depths of
the Bismarck Sea, it recorded on a mov-
ing tape the sound impulse of the pro-
pellers of every ship that passed over it.
Strategically placed, the instrument would
afford the enemy an accurate indication
of the importance and volume of our
convoy routes. Submarines and bombers
could be directed accordingly.
Exit the Warspite.
“Macnell”: Renowned in her day as
the Royal Navy’s best gunnery ship, old
.Warspite goes to the ship-breakers.
At Jutland she took a broadside of
heavy shells inboard, and gave as good
as she got. She was reconstructed in
1925,’ the alterations including all the
modifications learned from four years’
war experience, among them the installa-
tion of the revolutionary system of
director-fire control —with variations, still
in use today. From a further refit in 1937
Warspite emerged in modem battle-dress,
her a.-a. armament vastly increased to
meet the new threat of air attack, of which
naval gunnery experts were fully cog-
nisant. Her ship’s company’s training,
the efficiency of her gunnery-control
officers and her equipment combined to
produce gunnery accuracy which was
uncanny.
Once in the Mediterranean we were
target ship for her throw-off firings. In
this exercise the firing ship’s guns are
thrown off six degrees from the con-
trolling director, with the result that the
latter’s control team, actually trained on
the target, receive almost the benefit of
an actual engagement, though the guns
fire ahead or astern of the “enemy.”
A ripple of fire belched from the bulge
on the horizon. Twelve seconds later
the water dead astern of us was con-
vulsed into pillars of climbing white.
The range was nearly 14 miles. We
altered course continually, but zig-zag as
we would those falling salvoes dogged us
with well-nigh omniscient exactitude.
One black night off Matapan, a couple
of years later, Warspite nosed in along
her radar beam. At a spoken command
those guns roared into choirs of flame
that in a matter of minutes reduced the
leading ships of the enemy line to re-
sistless ruin. And not only the Italians
remembered those 15-inchers. Just be-
fore action was joined little Stuart, also
very much in the scrap, got a bit out of
station. Out of the murk to starb d
loomed a vast shape, so close that Stuart s
company heard the grind of her turrets as
they swung upon her. For one searing
moment the destroyer’s men looked into

those gaping maws; then, satisfied, the
barrels trained fore and aft, Warspite
ploughed on and Stuart scuffled back to
her place in the screen.
Warspite survived the war to do duty
in harbor as a gunnery training ship. No
ship was better suited for it, and though
the old warrior has done her last shoot,
so long as warships mount guns the men
who man them will remember her.
Corporal J. H. Armstrong, 2/40th
Battalion, for whose murder; in Koe-
pang in 1943 a Jap Kempei-tai officer
was tried at Darwin, was a Digger
whose courage and determination kept
him soldiering on after the Sparrow
Force surrender in Dutch Timor. He
did valuable and dangerous work, go-
ing out of the p.-0.-W. camp at Oesepa
Besar to collect information and estab-
lish contacts for relaying it to No. 2
Independent. Co., then operating in
Portuguese Timor. Shortly before the
final move of prisoners from Timor to
Java in September, 1942, Armstrong and
Gunner Martin (79th Light A.A. 8.E.F.)
broke camp in an attempt to reach the
Ind. Co. A peerless bushman, Armstrong
was reckoned the only man in camp likely
to succeed and Sparrow Force survivors
will often conjecture at the story behind
his failure. Those who knew him will
always regard Armstrong as one of the
real heroes of the war.
“Stop eating those oysters —you might swallow
a pearl!”
Troops from India have been sent to
the Persian Gulf port of Basra, which,
of course, is in Irak, “for the protection
of British, Indian and Arab lives and to
safeguard British and Indian interests
should circumstances demand it.” The
immediate occasion was an outbreak of
Persian-oilfields and pipeline-route strikes
with Communist trimmings, provided by
the Moscow-directed Tudeh party. From
the Persian Government has come a state-
ment, perhaps minted in the Soviet
Embassy at Tehran, that it will “never
permit foreign interference in the internal
affairs of Persia.” The Anglo-Indian
reply is that “there is no question of the
troops from Basra going into Persia ex-
cept in a grave emergency, which it is
hoped will not occur.”

“Macnell”; Ships of the First Frigate
Flotilla, based on Rabaul, are discom-
fited more by the town’s “oldest inhabi-
tant,” Matupi, than they ever were by
the Japs. An embracing stench of sul-
phur pollutes his neighborhood ; and the
sulphuretted hydrogen, the night’s dew
and the ship’s bright peace-time grey
paint combine to form a coat of greasy
black which turns the vessels overnight to
coal hulks. Daily scrubbing helps little.
The Navy has an answer to most things
threatening its taut appearance, but so
far all preventive measures have failed.
But it took a volcano to beat the Navy
—and from that the piebald flotilla derives
what comfort it can.

“Mullum”: Discharged at last, Whacker
started back at his old job “in the
groceries” at the town’s department store.
About dinner-time a stranger walked up
to the counter and asked for cigarette-
papers. Whacker looked him over,
“You’re the bloke who gave me a fort-
night’s C.B. at Pucka in 1943,” he said,
“and you’ve got the nerve to ask me for
papers.” His ex-C.O. walked out. At
the end of the day Whacker, with two
pals, walked into the corner pub. The
new publican grinned as the three breasted
the bar. “Fourteen days’ C.B. and no
cigarette-papers,” he said to Whacker.
“You’re drinking water tonight, mate.”

“Macnell”: The Navy is recruiting
fast, and if appearances are any indica-
tion these teen-age lads are some Sailors.
A kit inspection at Flinders Depot re-
vealed sartorial embellishments we re-
cruits of last decade never dreamt of.
Cuffs of jumpers, turned back after the
first few beers, are lined with red silk
for the port arm and green for the
start’d. Jumpers have glittering zip-
fasteners from arm-pit to hip band;
trouser pockets are also zipped. The
knot of the cap tally bow is smoothed
and rounded by the insertion of a trey-
bit, the tips of the bow being stiffened
from behind with invisible pins. Eighty
per cent, of the new entries are tattooed
long before they tread a ship’s deck, the
patterns ranging from chest-wide tigers
couchant to a wreath enclosing a broken
ship torpedoed fair amidships, sinking at
both ends, and the solemn motif “A
sailor’s grave.” But the best find was a
dickey front carefully hidden in the back,
of a locker. Stuck on the back with gum
was a thick fringe of hair that curled
realistically over its rim. Downy face
notwithstanding, there were no two ways
about that hairy chest.

“NX65381”: It happened in 1940 at
an army training depot. I was orderly-
corp. and, the evening
meal over, I was settling
down for a good bludge
when a batch of rookies
fresh from the enlist-
ment depot descended
upon me. I took their
papers and marched
them to the cookhouse,
where I kidded a couple
of surly babblers to rustle
up some munger. I then
hustled the newcomers to
the Q.-store for blankets
and palliasses. Opening
up a hut, I allotted them
positions, showed them
how to stow their gear,
fix up their bedding, and
said a few words about
the location of various
conveniences. Then, re-
membering the stove in
the orderly-room and the
book I had been reading,
I said: “Now, lads, off to
bed. It’s the rule that
rookies turn in early the
first night. I’ll give you
10 N minutes, then out
goes the light.” They
got under the blankets
like well-trained infants.
A little later when I told
the R.S.M. the new draft
was bedded down for the
night he stared at me in
amazement, “Blimey,”
said the R.S.M., an old Tommy
regular. “I’ve been 30 years a soldier
an’ ’ave never ’eard the likes of it.
Cor, you mus’ be a ruddy ’ippnertist.”
Thereafter to him I was always “The
Ruddy ’lppnertist.”

“Jemac”: Americans, despite their
reputations as go-getters, often got.
entangled in the red-tape vine. I recall
one occasion when troop-transports
arrived at a wreck-cluttered port just
cleared of the enemy. Naval wreck-dis-
persal parties, obliged to clear a channel
and provide quay space for disembarka-
tion, required floats from which to work
their divers. The Navy had no timber, but
suitable lengths lay in abundance ashore
—on charge to the Army. Supplies for
troops already ashore depended on the
transports berthing alongside, their arrival
there depended on the clearance of
wrecks, this depended on the divers, and
the divers depended on timber rafts. But
the timber was lashed securely ashore
with red tape and guarded by advance-
party troops, who were getting hungrier
and hungrier through lack of supplies
landed. It required the united efforts of
naval and military commanders-in-chief
in the area before Army’s timber could
be made available for Navy’s rafts.

PERSONAL ITEMS
Selection of Raphael Cilento as World
Director of Refugees under the new
U.N.O. plan confers another high honor
upon Australian medical science. Cilento
was lent by the Queensland Government
in 1945, at the request of U.N.R.R.A., to
deal with the malaria problem in the
Balkans. The troubled conditions there
led to his transfer to the British occu-
pation zone in Germany, first as Chief
Medical Officer and shortly afterwards
as director of all operations for dis-
placed persons. The position in-
volved attachment to the 21st Army,
and Cilento was given the rank of
major-general on the recommendation of
Field-Marshal Montgomery. Resigning
last June, under the terms of his appoint-
ment, he was selected as medical and ex-
pert member of the Australian delegation
to U.N.O. Health Conference ; the present
appointment affords proof of the effi-
ciency of his work in that capacity. It
is for an initial period of five years, and
is renewable. He will spend a brief
holiday in Brisbane taking up his duties
in New York.
In Melbourne to investigate the possi-
bilities of the Australian literary and
artistic field is R. W. Maynard, produc-
tion-manager of the “Penguin” series.
He was with John Lane from the modest
start of that surprising venture, which has
since printed over 40,000,000 Penguins,
Pelicans, Puffins and King Penguins. A
separate publishing house in Melbourne
is in prospect which will publish new
books by Australian authors as well as re-
prints of old ones in the “Penguin”
series. William Dobell and Russell Drys-
dale have already been booked up for
the Modern Painters series printed in
England. Maynard served with the
R.N. in the Mediterranean in the late
war and was at Singapore for the sur-
render. ,
Two Tasmanians, a parson and the
son of a parson, are off to Britain on
scholarships. Rev. J. L. May, precentor
of St. David’s Cathedral, Hobart, goes to
Oxford for a year on a British Council
scholarship. An A.I.F. man, he was
captured in Rabaul and was a p.-0.-w.
for over three years, most of the time in
Japan. B. J. Ralph, research officer of
the Division of Forest Products of
C.5.1.R., will have two years at Liverpool
University. He is a science graduate of
the University of Tasmania and a former
lecturer at Hobart Tech.
Sarawak’s newly-appointed Assistant
Commissioner of the Constabulary, Eric
Arthur Edmeades, of S.A., will not be a
stranger to that part of the world, as he
served in Borneo during the latter days
of the war. Son of a parson who spent
30 years in India, he was educated in
M.L. and at Scotch, Adelaide. He was
on the staff of Elder, Smith and Co. be-
fore enlisting in the A.I.F. in 1941. He
attained the rank of captain and became
instructor with the Ist Australian Para-
chute Battalion. After the Jap surrender
Edmeades joined the British Civil
Administration. He received his present
appointment when the Rajah was still in
Sarawak; it has now been confirmed by
the Colonial Office. He’s 24.
In sponsoring a permanent municipal
orchestra St. Kilda (Vic.) City Council is
pioneering a scheme that promises to
bring good orchestral programmes to
suburban and country dwellers. Marcus
White, its conductor, recently arrived
from England, tells of a similar move-
ment there, already far enough advanced
to look like becoming a permanent
feature. Leader of the new orchestra is
Stanislaw de Tarczynski, whose tawny
mane has been familiar to city concert-
goers for a generation. A laureate of the
Warsaw Conservatorium, he was a leader
of orchestras in several capitals of
Europe before he came to Australia, where
he led the Lady Northcote symphony
orchestra and toured as leader with the
Firm and Fuller’s. The itinerary of the
new outfit includes a round of Mel-
bourne’s suburbs —it was let loose on
Malvern last week. Later it intends to
visit country centres.
“Cauboy” tells why G.B.S. is still with
us:
The phenomenon of Shaw attaining the age
of 90 has produced a world-wide crop of ex-
planations. They range from the belief that it
is a demonstration of the efficacy of vegetarian-
ism and temperance to Shaw’s own recipe
“Wear thick boots and keep your bowels open.”
Probably Shaw himself doesn’t know why he
obstinately persists in living. What turned him
info a teetotaller and a vegetarian on his own
showing was the spectacle of his father, a con-
vivial old party, sulfused with remorse and
shame after his bouts with the bottle. He was
turned into a sceptic by the same parent. An
uncle was such a stupendous toper that a friend
who made a bet that he could find him sober
knocked him up at six in 'the morning and lost
his money. This uncle played several instru-
ments, and he gave Shaw a love of music, at
the same time destroying his nephew’s reverence
for the legends and personifications of litera-
ture and religion. Other uncles of disreputable
habits were proud of the fact that they were de-
scended from the Macduff who slew Macbeth,
and mentioned the fact at every opportunity.
They helped him to lose his awe of rank and
hereditary aristocracy. Shaw’s parents were too
poor to give him a university education, and
he was never made to study. He finished up by
being incapable of learning anything unless it
interested him and he was an unemployable and
broke at 30. Since then he has written over
40 plays and an incredible number of pam-
■phlets, prefaces and essays. Now his plays
are regarded as old-fashioned by young in-
tellectuals who got any ideas they have from
him and, although the things he stands for are
as revolutionary as ever, he has become an in-
stitution and attained the distinction of being
embalmed in his own lifetime.
Shaw may attribute his longevity to the thick-
ness of his bootsoles and the condition of his
bowels but it might just' as reasonably be attri-
buted to his inner urge to be a writer. Some
people have an inner urge; others get their urge
from outside. Shaw’s interest is so tremendous
that he could say (and probably believe) “I have
lived for 89 years and I am not yet fully adult
politically, but give me a second century of
apprenticeship as a ruler and at the end of it
I may be qualified as a senator and an oracle
for a third century. I do not admit any limit
to human life except statistically certain fatal
accidents.”

quite a lot of adventure into his life be-
fore becoming general manager of
A.W.A. in 1925. Nowadays his explora-
tions are done by radio, reaching out into
the ether and bumping the Heaviside
layer, but in 1913 he was down in the
vicinity of the South Pole with Shackle-
ton. After he got back from that trip
and had thawed out a little he joined the
R.N., serving in submarine-chasers and
later as a pilot in the R.N. Air Service,
forerunner of the Fleet Air Arm. He
has seen A.W.A. grow from a small con-
cern to a major national service making
a vast contribution in equipment, techni-
cal knowledge and research to the
country’s war effort.
Radio butts in unexpectedly now as a
rival to other professions. W. L. C.
Davies, after 10 years in the Adelaide
Police Force, rising to be Assistant Prose-
cutor, has thrown up that calling to be-
come an announcer in a broadcasting
station.
M.L.’s Chief Justice, Michael Myers,
retired last month. His 73 years have
done little to dim the C.J.’s versatile mind
and he goes into retirement brimful of
the vigor of youth. Born at Motueka,
Nelson, in 1873, he graduated LL.B. in
1896, in the following year being admitted
to the Bar. He took silk in 1922, and
built up a substantial practice in Welling-
ton, appearing in many noteworthy cases
in M.L. and before the Privy Council —
in all of the latter being successful.
Under Joseph Ward’s Administration he
was elevated to the Chief Justiceship in
1929.
Dead in Melbourne, at 60, Professor
R. Marshall Allan, till recently Dean of
the Faculty of Medicine at Melbourne
University, was appointed State director
of obstetrics in 1925 and could claim
much of the credit for Victoria’s reduced
maternal mortality rate. His influence
will be felt in days to come in the effi-
ciency of the staffs of maternity homes
and Hospitals, who were rigorously
trained by him. Allan had high honor
in his subject in U.S. and all over the
Empire, and last year was elected vice-
president of the Royal College of
Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, the first
outside the British Isles to be appointed
to the position. Born in Brisbane in
1886, he was educated at Scots College,
Sydney, and Edinboro’ University, and
served in Dublin and Europe before he
came to Melbourne. During the First
World War he was mentioned in
dispatches and got an M.C. for his work
with the R.A.M.C. and the A.I.F.
R. H. (Bobby) Gibbes, ex-wing com-
mander, R.A.A.F. fighter ace with the

himself by opening as a stock agent at
Coonamble in an ultra-modern fashion
with an aircraft to transport intending
buyers to inspect stock for sale. He
bought “The Butler Bat” which Arthur
Butler designed and built. Gibbes served
with No. 3 Squadron in the M.E. and rose
to command it. He was shot down twice.
On the first occasion he baled out and
got a broken ankle for his trouble ; the
second time he belly-landed in enemy
territory and walked back to his own
lines —it took him two nights and three
days—without food or water. He was
credited with 10i kills.
William Edward Davis, Melbourne’s
new chief of the C. 1.8., is at 51 the
youngest yet to be appointed. A Digger
of the First World War, he joined the
Force in 1921. Davis helped in the
apprehension of Richard Buckley, who
murdered a bank manager in 1931, of the
gang who shot a plain-clothes colleague
in 1933, and of Sodeman, the notorious
sex offender, in 1936.
E. J. Brady, one of the older school of
Bulletin bards, who will be 77 on
August 7, is still writing virile verse and
prose. His virility is not confined to
writing; his latest child, Edna June, was
born at Bigee on July 4.
J. D. Rogers, Director and General-
Manager for N.S.W. of Vacuum Oil, is a
Bachelor of Science whose first association
with the firm was as chief chemist for
N.S.W. After that he held down execu-
tive jobs in Sydney, Perth and Melbourne,
and spent some time in America studying
marketing and other aspects of his in-
dustry. Sketched here by Dubois, Rogers
has distinguished service in two wars to
his credit. In the first World War he
finished up with three pips on his shoulder
and an M.C. on his tunic ; in the scrap

just over he held the rank of Brigadier
and was Director of Intelligence on Allied
H.Q. in Brisbane.
July 19 saw the 85th birthday of W.A.’s
oldest politician, Sydney Stubbs, since
1911 M.L.A. for Wagin, For three
years prior to that he was in the
Legislative Council, which he entered
after a term as Mayor of Perth. Born
at Warrnambool (Vic.), he is still a solid
country man. His extreme taciturnity
gave rise to the legend that during one
of his many Parliamentary terms he spoke
only two words in the House—“ Hear,
hear!”
Adelaide’s Lord Mayor, John McLeay,
as Coventry has gone to some pains to
suggest, is nowadays able to bring some-
thing approaching the traditional alder-
MAYORAL CHAINS.
manic figure to the Council chamber.
Thirty-odd years ago, when he was a
Sheffield runner, the robes of office would
have hung rather forlornly on his frame.
He was less portly, too, when he carried
a stretcher with the 13th Field Ambulance
in the 1914-18 war, in which he won a
Military Medal. Brother of Senate
Opposition-leader George McLeay, he
is chairman of the furnishing firm the two
founded, and has been Chief Caledonian
and president of Adelaide Legacy. Mc-
Leay was born on Yorke Peninsula, but
Unley has been his stamping ground for
most of his life. In that suburb he has
been mayor, chairman or president of
everything about the place, and its mem-
ber in the Assembly. Of jovial disposi-
tion, he leaves political eloquence to
George, and is in his element as an after-
dinner speaker.
Neil Harcourt Mac Neil, headmaster of
Wesley College, dead suddenly in Mel-
bourne at 53, was Victorian Rhodes
Scholar for 1914. He went through World
War I with the Highland Light Infantry
and the R.F.C., winning a Military Cross.
After the Armistice he continued his
studies at Oxford, Edinburgh and London
Universities and went on to a teaching
appointment at Cheltenham College. Re-
turning to Australia in 1924 he became
first headmaster of Knox Grammar
School, Sydney, built it up to a roll-call
of close on 350 and resigned in 1939 to
take charge of Wesley. During his stay
in N.S.W. he initiated the Fairbridge
schools in that State and was secretary of
the scheme for many years. A keen oars-
man, he won his rowing blue at Oxford in
1920. A daily practice he instituted dur-
ing the war of calling the name of every
old boy killed on service was continued
by the senior master on the day after his
death—with Mac Neil’s name included.
Into the silence:
In Sydney, at 63, Harold George Barrie,
Surveyor-General of N.S.W., formerly District
Surveyor at Grafton, Goulbum and Maitland.
In Sydney, David Craig, Commissioner for
Main Roads in N.S.W. Born in Scotland, he
came to Australia 36 years ago, joined the
Roads Board in 1928 and became Commissioner
in 1941.
In Adelaide, at 77, Arthur Keast, formerly
head drover for Sidney Kidman, taking thou-
sands of cattle down from the Queensland
border to the Adelaide market.
In Toowoomba (Q.), at 86, Francis James
Patterson, a former Mayor, town clerk' and city
engineer. He was for years a surveyor and
constructional engineer on Queensland railways,
and also built the 500-mile telegraph line from
Cooktown to Cape York.
In Brisbane, at 75, Frederic Hamilton Hart,
for many years manager of Gibbs, Bright

lands.
At Armidale (N.SW.), at 56, C. R. Richard-
son, first Australian to be awarded the M.C. in
the 1914-18 war. An old boy of the Armidale
school, he was a great worker in local affairs
and was foundation president of Armidale

Women's Letters
From Sydney
Through all the perilous hazards lurk-
ing on the waters between Melbourne and
Sydney, H.M.A.S. Arunta brought the
State’s new Governor and his wife safely
to Port Jackson last Thursday morning.
The day was clear, more brightness than
warmth in the sunlight, and a wind sharp
as icicles beat into the faces of citizens
waiting along Macquarie-street. There
were no dense crowds and no barricades,
but there were lots of police along the
route. On high buildings the flags flew
stiff and proud. Planes roared overhead ;
from Mrs. Macquarie’s Chair guns
roared.
Up Macquarie-street from Man-o’-War
Steps, where they had landed, the vice-
regals drove, preceded by a company of
mounted police (from horses’ hooves to
riders’ helmets a gleaming and spirited
sight), and surrounded by police motor-
cyclists very business-like and dashing.
On the left of them the statues of former
Governors, pioneers and green sward and
stretching palms, and on the right tall
buildings crammed with doctors for every
ache and pain that man is heir to. If
they had had time to read the plates as
they passed they must have felt heartened
—or maybe a trifle deflated. However, no
sign of that was shown in Lt.-General
John Northcott’s face nor in the face of
his wife. They were both smiling and
happy; the general saluted. Mrs. North-
cott every now and then waved her posy
of pink orchids and hyacinths.
These had been given to her on the
red-carpeted, flag-gay wharf by the wife
of Premier McKell, whose husband was
of course the first to greet the Northcotts.
From the big outer gates leading to Gov-
ernment House there were Boy Scouts,
and from the Lodge gates the grounds
were starred with guards of honor, in-
cluding members of Women’s Services.
There was a military band, there were
high-ranking and much-decorated police
officers. There were cameramen, too, of
every denomination. Lt.-Governor Sir
Frederick Jordan and Lady Jordan re-
ceived the new Governor and his wife as
they stepped into their new home. The
swearing-in ceremony took place in the
pleasant ballroom. Here were Judges in
their gowns and wigs, Ministers of State
and members of Parliament and their
wives, all smiling under new (or so they
seemed) hats. Sydney’s Lord Mayor was
there. Cardinal Gilroy and Archbishop*
Mowll were notables. Many of the guests’
were in the uniforms of the Services.
The oath was administered by Mr.
Justice Davidson. Official-secretary L. C.
Robb’s voice was sturdy as he read the
King’s Commission, and the Governor’s
was warm and sincere in his first official
speech. Mrs. Northcott, whose suit was
beige in coloring, and whose hat was a
smart alliance of navy felt and velvet, and
daughter Elizabeth, whose navy frock
and flower-trimmed hat were very attrac-
tive, sat absorbed throughout the cere-
mony.
Greetings were many. They were ex-
pressed in flowers, telegrams and cables.
Among these was a cable from daughter
Lieut. Marjorie Northcott, now with the
A.A.M.W.S. in Japan.
By now the Australian Women’s
Charter Conference is in full cry. It
opened at the exhibition of Women
Painters in the National Gallery last Sun-
day, and on Saturday there was a recep-
tion for the two striking looking Indian
delegates, Mrs. Mithan Lam and Miss
Kapilla Khandvala. These two delegates
will lecture tonight in the Assembly Hall
in Margaret-street,
There is so much of interest at the
C.E.M.A. art show that it took a second
visit to take in even half of it. To begin
with, the gallery chosen for the display
is Paling’s, and as there are 143 exhibits,
including 12 or more groups of sculpture,
there wasn’t much room for walkabout
at the opening last Thursday afternoon.
Knight Robert Garran opened the show,
and told of the thousands and thousands
of pounds the English Government was
giving to C.E.M.A. It must have been
mouth-watering to admirers of the arts,
and to the exponents of painting, the
theatre and the dance who were listening.
In Australia the Government gives its
benediction. Loudon Sainthill has done
a good job in the hanging and the display
of the many works, and at the opening
deputy-president L. F. Keller made per-
tinent remarks on the art of criticism.
In the surging crowds who listened and
tried to gaze were Mrs. Hubert
Fairfax and Mrs. Keith Morris, singer
Barbara Bennett, pianist Trixie Tange,
very pretty and sparkling, and Mrs. Persia
Porter, who makes V.A. uniform look
the only garb for women of charm. Ali-
son Rehfisch’s “Flowers for a Lady” and
Alice Danciger’s “Houses” were among
things admired.
Sydney had the chance to hear a pianist
from Canada last week. A crowded Con-
servatorium proved that it was eager to
do so. The player, Ross Pratt, is slim,
dark and his smile is pleasing. He has
the easy manners of one whose instru-
ment and himself are of the same mind.
There was something of the crispness of
his native atmosphere about his playing,
and he made the Bach-Busoni memorable.
Two sonatas by the Spanish composer
Soler and the groups of Debussy and
Ravel were attractive in their direct state-
ment.
At the Wool Board’s dress parade the
other afternoon, even when the numbers
on the programme and the announcer did
not hit the stage quite at the same
moment, it was impossible for any on-
looker to muse that once more the sheep
had gone astray. Australia’s little pets
had done the perfect job again and turned
out fleeces from which the most delect-
able frocks and suits and undies had been
Mrs. John Northcott, wife of Lieut.-
General John Northcott, Governor
of New South Wales.

,made by English designers. In the collec-
tion displayed were wedding frocks
and negligees of gossamer fineness;
slim-fitting suits, smart sports wear, even-
ing frocks pleated and swathed, and as
flattering to the figure as delicate silljs.
Another great lure about these woollen
dresses is that they are crease-resisting.
One lovely yellow housecoat printed in
Paisley design and cut on very full dirndl
lines, and a tea-gown in oyster wool crepe
and rose-tan chiffon, the skirt and flowing
sleeves of which are all knife-pleated,
hadn’t even been pressed, although they
had come from England.
The ballroom of the Australia was
packed tight with men and women buyers
and designers for the big stores. There
were manufacturers’ representatives there,
too. Premier McKell was the after-
noon’s important. No doubt the
jodhpurs and jacket in all-worsted cloth
appealed to him. After actress Muriel
Steinbeck had announced and commented
on the last item —a turquoise wool even-
ing frock, folded and swathed, and
crusted on the shoulders with sequins and
semi-precious stones —there were cock-
tails, the long stage being turned into a
buffet with eye-blinking speed.
Hector Bolitho confesses that he did
not find the Town Hall the ideal place
for lecturing. He found the towering
heights like so many mischievous caverns
eager to seize and hold the voice. In
reality Hector’s voice (amplified, of
course) was very good. He has the accent
that all Maorilanders are proud of, and
that is no accent at all. The Town Hall
was very crowded, and fashionable
Sydney was there in layers. There were
many there who had been young and gay
in Sydney of twenty-odd years ago when
Hector was also young and gay, even
though, according to himself,-he man-
aged successfully to get the sack from
three newspapers. His lecture plumbed
no depths, but it was distinctly enter-
taining, and his little picture of the old
Arab chief, descended from the Prophets,
and himself finding a tiny valley filled
with small pink flowers quivering in the
spring wind, and at the same moment
ejaculating, the one in Arabic, the other
in English, “They are laughing,” makes
almost as pretty a picture for the mind as
Mr, Wordsworth’s dancing daffodils.
Mildred Cable and Francesca and
Evangeline French, three remarkable
ladies who have given their lives to help-
ing others, came to Sydney last week.
The three are missionaries, and for 30
years they have travelled about China
teaching their message. They have
crossed the Gobi desert several times,
making stay here and there, and have
known the cold and rigors of Chinese
Turkestan and Tibet. For 20 years they
were in charge of a mission school in the
province of Shansi. They have lived
together and worked together, and they
have written a number of books on
their journeys. They come to Australia
as delegates for the British and Foreign
Bible Society, and are the guests of Arch-
bishop and Mrs. Mowll. Yesterday after-
noon the Lady Mayoress gave a reception
in their honor.
Mrs. J. Bollen, who was Sheila Kearns,
gave a farewell party last week at the
home of her parents, Mr. and Mrs. P.
Kearns, Chatswood, in honor of Dr. and
Mrs. H. (Bill) Hughes. The doctor and
his wife sail in a few days on the Orbita
for England, where he will do a
post-graduate course. During the war Dr.
Hughes served as a major in the A.I.F.
with the A.A.M.C. in the Middle East
and New Guinea. Their son Paul will be
cared for while they are away by his
grandparents.
From Melbourne
This week, devoted by the Anglican
Church to the call to youth, is packed
with many functions, final and most im-
portant of which will be a procession
through the streets next Sunday to St.
Pauls, where leading churchmen and citi-
zens will be on the saluting base. After
the procession there will be three ser-
vices in the Cathedral, the Chapter House
and Cathedral Close. A special feature
of the procession will be the four banners
which represent church work among
youth. In keeping with the motto of the
Youth Week is the booklet just issued;
Our Job in the Church. Clever illus-
trations, many of them colored, are the
work of Gwen Hollis, who is engaged in
engineering drawing in the A.W.A.S.
Gwen, who is a sister of Rev. Howard
Hollis, organist at Christ Church, South
Yarra, studied art at the Swinburne
Technical College.
This photo, by Broothorn of Jean
Wallace Mitchell is the first taken since
she exchanged her W.A.A.A.F. uniform
for the more glamorous deckings of
Civvy-street. Jean, whose engagement
was mentioned in last week’s Bulletin,
is busy doing the social rounds with her
fiancé.
H.M.A.S. Lonsdale (the Port Mel-
bourne Naval Depot) made an original
setting for the At Home given by the
Australian Naval Board. Object of the
party was to say “thank you” to the
hundreds of women who had worked
hard to make Navy House a success.
During the war years R.A.N. men made
this a home while in port; men from the
Allied navies also were sure of a warm
welcome there. It was the Lady Colvin
Auxiliary which provided £2OOO to start
off Navy House, and public subscriptions
keep it going. The affair went off with
that ease and efficiency so characteristic
of the Navy when it adopts the role of
host. With Mrs. Showers, wife of Com-
mander Showers, who took Shropshire
and the troops to England for the
Victory March, came Mrs. Anthony,
wife of the Finance Member of the Naval
Board. The Hon. Mrs. Douglas was with
daughter Victoria. Commander B. Bar-
wood and Mrs. Barwood, Lieut. V. Joy
and Mrs. Joy, Commander George Gill,
who is busy writing the history of the
R.A.N., Reg Collins, brother of the Com-
modore, and Phelia Grimwade were
amongst the throng who enjoyed them-
selves.
With a fine flow of eloquence, R.
Haughton James opened the exhibition
of paintings by R, Malcolm Warner.
Among the works hung in George’s Gal-
lery were many scenes of the Canadian
countryside. Artist Esther Paterson took
time off from wielding her own brushes
to be there. Wife of Senator Leckie
popped in. Peg Williams, who capably
manages her own gallery, the Blue
Door, and Mrs. W. Dargie, wife of the
newly appointed Art Master at the
National Gallery, also dropped in to cast
appreciative eyes over the canvases.
The final Goossens concert was a musi-
cal treat, with Volterra as pianist in the
Tschaikowsky Concerto in B Flat Minor.
Mrs. Volterra, daughter of the T. H.
Kellys, of Sydney, who makes it a
practice never to sit in the audience when
her husband is playing, was seen backstage
later in a formal black gown covered by
a three-quarter length pastel-blue wool
coat embroidered in silver sequins.
Sitting with vice-chancellor of the
’Varsity J. D. G. Medley was Mrs.
Bernard Heinze. Joan Hammond was
also in the audience; her mink coat was
worn over a short chartreuse frock, Inez
Lillies took a breather at the concert be-
fore plunging into the details of the visit
to this city of Madge and Cyril Ritchard.
An unusual sight was a group of small
boys diving into boxes of chocolates
and absorbing ice-cream with their
Tschaikowsky.
Eugene Goossens and his wife will be
glad of the quiet sea trip to England, for
since they arrived in Melbourne they
have been feted and feasted unendingly.
The famous conductor has been most
accessible, and budding composers and
pianist have been given a sympathetic
hearing. Recently he spent an hour listen-
ing to Viva Holgate Clarke play some of
his compositions which she will include
in her recital at the end of this month.
Latest function given in honor of the
composer-conductor and his wife was an
afternoon party at the National Theatre
headquarters. Gertrude Johnson, direc-
tor of the theatre, received the guests,
with Lady Knox, president of the
National Theatre, also extending the glad
hand. Gertrude’s hat was notable for its
gay nodding plumage; Lady Knox
pinned a large spray of colorful spring
flowers in her ermine coat, and Mrs.
Goossens covered her black wool frock
and finely checked ' black and green
jacket with a three-quarter length mink
dyed squirrel coat.
The Tivoli’s new show “Stars and
Garters” is going well. The bright splash
of nonsense includes Rubye Colleano,
who wears bolero and trousers of black
net shimmering with gold sequins in her
unusual dance, “A Romance in Por-
celain” was an endurance test for the
girls in short pink panniered frocks over
white-laced petticoats, who posed as the
figures on Dresden ornaments. Mr. and
Mrs. R. Honeyman, the latter attractive
in a black ensemble and silver fox furs,
and Helen Ellison, just out of uniform,
were among the big first-night audience.
At the Celebration Ball held at No. 9
Darling-street to mark the centenary of
St. Peters, Eastern Hill, 16 debs, with hair
sprays matching their posies of pastel-
tinted flowers were presented by Mrs.
Dan Reddan to the Lady Mayoress, Mrs.
Bernard Heinze, graceful in a gown of
wine organza, pin-spotted in white. Ger-
trude Cottrell, a member of the ball com-
mittee, had diamond clips and a wide
choker necklace of pearls to offset her
black frock. Another member, Marjorie
Spry, wore a white georgette gown which
had appliqued flowers of black georgette
on the wide skirt. Mrs. W. McDermott’s
white crepe gown was cut on slim-tailored
lines. With the Frank Watts, the latter
in pastel-blue crepe, were the John Mc-
Graths, of Albury. Harry Davey’s party
included Capt. and Mrs. Olney Fendick,
the latter in a black dinner frock featur-
ing a turquoise yoke, heavily embroidered
in black beads, and Mrs. Edward Ford-
ham, who chose black tulle. President
of the ball committee Mrs. H. G. Connell
wore a tailored gown of pink clover
crepe; Mrs. Dan Reddan was in lime-
green satin bouffant; Mrs. David Ely in
pastel-blue crepe. In the official party
was Canon Farnham Maynard, vicar of
St. Peters,
The committee of the Melbourne
Ballet Club has obtained the services of
Laurel Martyn to produce and direct
ballet exclusively for their organisation.
Laurel, in company with other well-
known dancers Corrie Loders, Noel
Murray, Grace McLean and Max Collis,
is hard at work with new ideas and
choreography. The first performance,
comprising four new ballets, will be given
later in the year. The work of the club
is devoted specifically to the develop-
ment of a national ballet.

The appearance of estimates of national
expenditure for the current financial year
makes apparent the growing weight of the
burden of government. War years apart,
it is evident that, taxation will take a
much greater proportion of the national
income than it used to ; and much of it
will be taken from resources otherwise
available for capital expansion, and
diverted to consumption. Portion of the
money will find its way back, through the
social services that will take so much of
it, into the hands of a section of the
public—not always the section from
which it came.
And there is that aspect of “full”
employment about which the Treasurer
has left the , public uninformed to
date, namely, long-term financing. The
resilience of the national income, once
transition is over, is an unknown quantity.
It is possible that before reconstruction
is complete signs of recession might
appear. The practical issue over, say, the
next five years is how far the Treasury
is prepared to allow the national debt
to rise, if necessary, in order to maintain
“full” employment.
It is plain that we are to have
a new slicing; but are we to have
a bigger cake? Whether the omens
are propitious or otherwise, it is
quite clear that national salvation lies in
maximum production, without which
neither the national income nor the
general standard of living will be main-
tained. To the extent to which we suc-
ceed in concentrating our efforts on
genuine production, rather than on sec-
ondary economic activities, the relative
burden of the national debt will decline.
What the Government needs to do is tot
up tnc liabilities side of its social,and
“full” employment balance-sheet, and fix
a limit for a given national income, in-
stead of nonchalantly adding one to one.
Recent banking legislation is designed
to shape and control the nature and direc-
tion of capital and other expenditure.
Among other things, the class and pur-
pose of trading bank advances have been
made subject to direction and control of
the Commonwealth Bank, which has be-
come a Government agency for p#licing
economic policy on the money side.
Doubtless the Government’s powers will,
at the outset, be used with apparent
caution and discretion, which will be
made easy by buoyant markets. How
they will be used in the more distant
future will largely depend upon political
trends and the circumstances of the
moment. All that is certain at present
is that the initiative to direct rests with
the Government. The rate of profit that
can be earned by the trading banks is not
specifically limited by legislation, but
Government control of investment and
interest rates means control of earning
capacity.
The Q.N. does about 90 p.c. of its busi-
ness in its home State. Here good rains
fell early during the 12 months covered
by the latest accounts, but they were both
preceded and followed by long dry spells.
This and the revival of civilian trade
generally, following the end of war, and
the need to overtake deferred improve-
ments to pastoral and other properties,
etc., strengthened demand for financial
accommodation. For the first time since
1939 there was an expansion in advances

ment. Liquids (up £1,077,468) include a
special deposit with the Commonwealth
Bank of £11,373,000, largest single item
among the co.’s assets. Add to this
£3,604,317 of Federal Government securi-
ties, and you get a total of £14,977,317
(=7l p.c. of deposits, or more than half
total assets), which the co. has made
available to the Government. The trend
is noteworthy by reason of its association
with official policy. Subject to Govern-
ment permission, the co. is exceptionally
well equipped to further assist clients as
the need arises.
Improvement in the year’s gross earn-
ings (£435,334) was £37,545. Trading
exes. (£295,748) took £28,001 of the in-
crease, and the tax bill (£47,905) was only
£414 heavier. The net result (up £9130)
was 5.2 p.c. on capital, or 3.4 p.c. on
shareholders’ funds (capital and reserves
combined). So the interminable deposit
stock, which is costing the co. on the
average 3| p.c., is barely earning its keep
these days. The div. was lifted a point,
making it 5 p.c.
At £5 19s. 6d. the f.-p. £5 shares return
4.3 p.c. on a 5 p.c. div. basis.

In a field which many underwriters have
found poorly remunerative, this Mel-
bourne co., with predominantly auto, con-
nections, for which the State office is
now a competitor, has grown prosperous
on a handful of capital—until a one-for-
one par issue in 1938, only £25,000. One
of the early consequences of war-time re-
striction of supplies of petrol and tyres
was a severe reduction in mileage run
by motor vehicles, other than those used
by the Services and Government depart-
ments. The lessened accident and other
hazards were recognised, and premium
rates were revised to reflect the changed
circumstances.
Now the reverse side of the picture is
beginning to show up. Increases in petrol
rationing, the easing of the tyre position,
and lack of driving practice, which has
affected the road sense of a percentage
of drivers, are reflecting themselves in an
increased number of accidents and other
causes of claims. And the cost of repairs
is now much greater than it was pre-war.
Moreover, the position is' likely to get
worse before it begins to improve. A
revision of premium rates for this class
of business is, therefore, an early possi-
bility.
Here is a comparison of the co.’s under-
writing experiences since 1934:

Last term premium income stepped up
£10,346. But claims" took an extra £7 Bs.
of each £lOO of premiums. The pleasing
feature was that the larger business was
written at £9 6s. p.c. less cost. Thus the
underwriting surplus was £3077 stronger
at £ll,Bll. Interest, etc., brought in
£8853 (down £276), making the net return
from-all sources £20,664 (up £2801).
After allowing for bonus rebates to
policyholders, the balance (£16,263) was
32.5 p.c. on capital, compared with 27,
26.3, 15.2, 0.8, 28.5 and 29.8 p.c. back to
1940. The div. was kept at an all-round
25 p.c.
The board wrote the year’s profit at
£16,530 as against £17,451 for the previous
term. The difference between these
figures and the surpluses shown in the
table represents variations in the amount
reserved (£44,882 at end April last) for
unearned premiums—premiums actually
received, but risks in respect of which
were still current when the books closed.
There is nothing to worry about in the
finances, which conform to sound under-
writing practice;

After allowing for the final div. and

could see net tangibles equal to nearly

ing the pound ords., paid to 10s. each, at

§ Subject to taxation.
The co. turns out builders’ and
plumbers’ hardware, dairy utensils,
kitchen equipment, etc., and has done so
ever since it took over the business of
F. Mailey and Sons in 1919. The works
are at Alexandria, and there are three
selling branches in the N.S.W. metropolis
and one at Brisbane, thus enabling the
co. to get a retail as well as a
manufacturer’s rake-off. Following the
economic stagnation of the early 1930’5,
when losses totalling £24,654 showed up.
earnings made an encouraging recovery
until war brought building activity, etc..
to a standstill. Plant was switched to
production of munitions and equipment
for the Services. So, despite mounting
taxation and other costs, which bumped
up the ratio of exes, to turnover, net
earnings for the six years to close of
accounts in 1945 averaged £22,705 (=
9.8 p.c, on capital) compared with an
average of £25,197 (=10.9 p.c, on capi-
tal) for the four preceding years.
The revival of building activity gave
last term’s turnover a lift. For the 11
months to end May last the value of
permits issued in Sydney and suburbs
for new buildings, alterations and addi-
tions was nearly £10,000,000, compared
with £1,880,000-odd for the correspond-
ing period of 1944-45. Leaving taxation
out of the reckoning, the board wrote
the year’s profit £11,994 better at
£56,070. Since 1941 no specific provision
has been made to meet the Government's
share of each year’s earnings. The tax
bill, when it arrives, has been charged
against the amount brought forward from
the previous term. In the table taxation
has been deducted from the year’s profit
to which it relates. The 1946 figure,
which is still subject to taxation, is not
therefore comparable with those of pre-
ceding years. Still, the final result
promised to be better than the 1945 one.
A strong demand for the co.’s products
is “expected to continue for some years,
and as raw materials become more plenti-
ful turnover will undoubtedly expand far
beyond pre-war levels,” the board says.
An area of 11 acres has been bought at
Auburn, near Sydney, and it is proposed
to erect a modern factory on the site,

it also holds the adjoining Young Aus-

—the latter was worked, with Govern-
ment assistance, for two years to end
1944. Paid capital is £303,750 (in ss.
shares), of which £50,625 carries a cumu-
lative 10 p.c. p.a., then shares equally
with the ords. in any distribution they
receive, and upon redemption (at the

The co. shared the common experience of
the industry during the war —shortage of
labor and materials and a steep rise in
costs. The sharp drop in last term’s pro-
fit figure, which was written after capi-
talising £14,979 spent on geological ex-
ploration, was due to suspension of pro-
duction at the Occidental for approxi-
mately a year from April 15, 1945.
Operating figures for the two plants

The absence of development during the
war years, owing to shortage of skilled
labor, resulted in serious depletion of
ore' reserves. To ensure production of
a satisfactory and profitable tonnage
during the years ahead, speedy opening
up of Nos. 13 and 14 levels at the Occi-
dental became necessary. So production
was suspended, as already mentioned,
the main shaft was deepened a further
300-odd feet to 2015 ft. and the opening
up of Nos. 13 and 14 levels commenced.
To help take up the slack in volume of
mill feed Cobar production was
quickened, and 74,723 tons of 1.1 dwt.
Cobar tailings were cyanided, with dis-
appointing results.
A feature of the development pro-
gramme at the Occidental is installation
of a 36in. x 24in. Ruwolt jaw crusher at
No. 14 (2000 ft.) level. The work is
scheduled for completion by end 1946.
The idea is to step up mine output by
about 25,000 tons ore p.a. to a total of
125,000 tons p.a. and to reduce costs by
increasing skip haulage and lowering the
amount of expensive secondary breaking
of run-of-mine ore. The method of ore-
breaking is to be by blasthole diamond
drilling, which is also expected to help
costs#
At November 25 last ore reserves were
figured as follows:

Occidental figures relate Ao ore above
the 1820 ft. horizon, and the quantity in
this section of the mine isn’t likely to be
increased. Enough work has not yet been
done to form a reliable estimate of pay-
ore available below this level. In the
Cobar the drill has disclosed encourag-
ing values below No. 9 level, and further
exploratory work is being undertaken
here and on the level above. In the Ches-
ney there is about 10,000 tons pay-ore
in the slopes, which is to be treated as
soon as opportunity offers. The drill has
failed to disclose downward continua-
tion of the gold shoot in this mine.
Production at the Occidental began
again on May 6, 1946. To June 9, 3802
tons were treated for a working loss of
£3468. Production has now reached
about 1100 tons ore a week, and not
much better is expected until the man-
power position improves. From the close
of accounts to June 9, 1946, 35,627 tons
from the Co bar yielded a working profit
of £7707. The co.’s future depends upon
how things turn out in the lower levels of
the Occidental, upon the possibility of
new payable ore bodies being discovered
elsewhere and upon the extent to which
costs can be pulled back. It is too early
yet to form a reliable opinion on these
matters.
Finances are comfortable. To meet
£50,442 coming to outsiders the co. was
holding £160,262 in readily realisable
assets, largely Government securities and
cash, when the books closed. Since
then C. E. Blackett has stepped out
of the g.m.’s chair, to hang up his
shingle as a consultant, and F. R. Biggs
has stepped in. Blackett came to the co.
from W.A. with a high reputation 10
years ago, and did much to improve
mining technique, quicken production and
restrain costs.

be one of them yourself) have been built on a simple
recipe:— When you lock up, lock your business worries
away until the morning . . . take a small quantity of
whisky to break the spell of the day’s tension . . , and
use the evening for peace, pleasure or broad planning.
The unique merit of whisky for this purpose is that,
used wisely, it suits and safeguards the normal man’s
constitution.
♦
First, the composition of mature whisky is particularly
pure, in the medical sense. It aids instead of taxing
the digestion.
Second, the quantity needed for healthful stimulation
is relatively small.
The secret of wisdom in using it, as in so many things,
is moderation, and insistence on sound quality. The
best Australian brands are excellent in flavour and
purity, and have been brought to a high level of
wholesomeness by ageing for the exceptional period
of over 5 years.

SUNDRY SHOWS
John EBdershaw's Paintings.
One picture of really extraordinary
beauty is among the 24 watercolors and
six oils which John Eldershaw is showing
at the Moreton Galleries, Brisbane. A
watercolor entitled “Twilight,” it reminds
one that Eldershaw at his best can achieve
the poetry of Hilder; if not quite with
such a lyrical flash, then, compensatingly,
on a larger and broader scale.
The painting deals with nothing more
strange than a yacht at anchor, dusky she-
oaks and distant hills —a subject every
landscape painter, including Eldershaw,
has attempted many times. Nor is the
sombre, rather melancholy mood of twi-
light—though excellently conveyed here
—anything very much out of the com-
mon. It is the painting of light that
makes this watercolor remarkable ; the
cold, evanescent brilliance suffusing the
dusk of the whole picture, and the
dramatic last flare of color in the sky,
rose among the grey.
Eldershaw, like all landscape painters,
and like such poets of the landscape as
Wordsworth, has two approaches to
nature: the visionary and the common-
place. Sometimes he does no more than
faithfully transcribe what’s before him,
and because he is a competent craftsman
you get an old ramshackle corrugated-iron
boatshed looking exactly like an old
boatshed; which, if you happen to want
an old boatshed, is very well. But some-
times, as in “Twilight,” you get something
more. There is twilight poetry again in
“The Gleam,” which shows cattle drink-
ing at a shallow pool in a valley with
mountains in the distance; “The Jetty”
shows a sparkling morning mood of blue
water and white sails; “Annabella” —a
departure for this artist —gives a Degas-
like quality to a doll in a white dress;
“Old Ned,” with a rich russet cart-horse
against a shed with a shadowy interior
and a sunny wall, is the mellow poetry of
afternoon; and “Farm in the Gully,”
with a farmhouse and trees in blossom
against the gigantic green hills of Tilba
Tilba on the South Coast road to Mel-
bourne, is a dramatisation of the earth’s
immensity,
C.E.M.A. Exhibition
John Eldershaw has two paintings in
Morley and Torda’s C.E.M.A. exhibition
—“The Silo,” which is poor for Elder-
shaw, and “South-Sea Landscape,” which
is a high curve of rich green hill behind
farm buildings, with cattle, richly glowing
and flecked with light, and a flowering
tree providing the right light lyric touch.
Over 60 contemporary artists have
work on show, so the products are
naturally mixed, but, with all fair allow-
ances for difficulties of representation, in-
ferior work has been too kindly treated.
There seems to be no excuse for hanging
in prominent positions such pieces as
James Cant’s “Red Earth”—adorned with
the generic green sky—and P. Shepherd’s
“Evening Landscape,” and “Landscape
with Figures”—both remarkably like
Turkish comic-strips—while the paintings
of Eldershaw and Lance Solomon are
relegated to comparative obscurity.
Lance Solomon has two paintings, “The
Golden Grey” and “Cattle Country,” and
like Eldershaw’s pictures one is good
but commonplace and the other is ex-
cellent. “The Golden Grey” is recognis-
able as a Solomon painting and has suffi-
cient subtlety and symmetry, in a dull
way, to make it superior to much of the
work done by contemporary artists. But
“Cattle Country” is much better, with the
right tone of grasslands, soft touches of
light on trees and beauty even in the
bared patches of red earth. H. Hanke’s
“Sunlit Coast” is remarkable for the filmy
effect of the horizon of the sea, mingled
with the shadowy smoke of a distant
steamer. But it lacks balance.
Of other work, Erik Langker had a
large, workmanlike “Sea Rhythm” ; James
Cook’s “Sick and Wounded at Lae” was
interesting in a documentary way; Thea
Proctor had some light, bright, magazinish
flowers; H. Badham’s “Snack Bar” was
faithful and amusing ; Dobell contributed
a portrait, vivid, impressionistic and a
little pretentious. Rhys Williams’s fine
“Hoy Loft,” with spangled sunlight and
patterns ofgreen, was unfortunately
tucked away in the obscurity of a corner.
William Prater’s Art
Unlike the majority of Cezanne-influ-
enced Australian artists, William Prater,
who has an exhibition of paintings at the
Macquarie Galleries, Sydney, has a selec-
tive intelligence. He does not confuse
means with achievement, and for all the
slapdash method of laying on primary
colors, there is never any doubt that it is
Australian scenery he is painting. At his
best he is vivid, vigorous and promising ;
at his worst, confused, with disorderly
jumbles of crude colors.
Of two “Yarras” (numbered 17 and
21 on the catalogue) No. 17 is the better.
A colorful reflection of lights in the water
from the hanging vegetation of the river
bank, it is somewhat overbright and may
not be the Yarra, but the blending and
balancing of colors show promise o'fj
high technical skill,
“A Creek” and “Flat Rock Barn,”
bought by the N. S. Wales National Gal-
lery, are interesting specimens of Prater’s
characteristics, but not the best on exhi-
bition.
“Billabong on the Goulburn,” although
not a good painting, is interesting as an
example of Prater’s potentialities, for
there is a fine effect of dappled light on
red and white trees and sun-dried grass.
The tree are rigid and the whole is marred
by the lack of symmetry and subtlety of
tone which is evident in Prater’s work
—a complementary characteristic to his
technique. But there is perception, and
a certain hard pin-pointing of brilliance
which suggests that if he progresses
further—from Cezanne to the Australian
masters, particularly Streeton much
better results may be expected.
Out of the Cry-room.
Sydney Minerva printed for “The
Third Visitor” a programme of pre-war
copiousness, offering among theatrical
gossip and useful advice on how to make
oneself beautiful with Fluffy Cleansing
Cream the interesting information that
the theatre possesses a “cry-room” where
while still able to see the performance’
mothers may retire with their squalling
young.
It cannot fairly be said that this is the
appropriate place from which to view
“The Third Visitor,” for the show is
lively enough as popular entertainment,
and it has some relation to art in that it
is very well acted. Indeed, in-the first
scene, richly set in a handsome panelled
dining-room, when Richard Ashley,
Norman Bladder and John Bushelle are
walking and talking with a masculine
ease and strength all too rare on the
Sydney stage, the play looked as if it
might turn out a really worth-while drama.
Thereafter the acting continued good,
Joan Deering, conveying tenseness,
moved with peculiar short, high steps as
if she was treading on eggs, but she
showed a pleasing venom in upbraiding
a policeman ; and Charles Zoli, Muriel
Steinbeck, Rod Douglas and Eric
Reiman were more than capable. But
the play increasingly degenerated.
It was not drama, it appeared, but
merely a thriller; and not a well-made
thriller, but loosely and haphazardly
strung together as if the author himself
had never known what he was going to do
next. And then not a thriller proper, but
a work partaking of the nature of a spy
story, with reminiscences of the Beast of
Belsen—a category always disappointing,
because spies are always villainous and
always bail up the heroine in a secret
passage or tunnel and are always pre-
vented at the last moment from shoot-
ing her. And so what looked as if it
might be a real play turned out to be a
second-rate melodrama.

Melbourne Tiv.
Served hot and steaming by a bewilder-
ing succession of swift and noisy waiters,
“Stars and Garters” is Melbourne Tivoli’s
latest confection. The stars are not all of
the same magnitude, but there is nothing
wrong with the garters, which make their
appearance on every possible and impos-
sible occasion on the legs of the Tiv,
ballet. The Bendinos are three hefty
ladies whose digestions must be perfect
judging by the ease with which they
manipulate their torsos. Rubye Colleano,
an Australian recently returned from
England, claims to be the only female
artist performing the “Somersault toe to
toe” routine and nobody is likely to con-
tradict her. June and Collett are two
more dancers who impart to their act an
air of innuendo more eloquent than
words by sundry gestures. There are
arid stretches in the entertainment which
Clem Da we irrigates with a natural flow
of wit and humor.

The best feature of Keith Macartney’s
production of “Antony and Cleopatra
at Melbourne University’s Union Theatre
was the staging and lighting. The
Romans and Egyptians assembled by
Queen’s College hardly came up to Shak-
speare’s specifications. It was hard t if
believe that Bryan Stafford’s Antony was
the man who, after straddling half the
known world, became the man made
“drunken to destruction” by a woman,
or that the Octavius Caesar of David
Bradley was the subtle intellectual who
dethroned him. Gwen Izzard’s Cleopatia
was better.

Af the Talkies
A pilot from the wars returning finds
his drunken wife holding a drunken party,
and is welcomed home with an introduc-
tion to her lover and a confession that
his son was killed in a car accident caused
by the lady’s drunken driving. Within a
few hours the lady is a corpse, the police
are seeking the husband, the husband is
trailing the lover, the lover’s beautiful
and virtuous wife is aiding the husband,
and the husband’s friend, who suffers
periods of violent mental derangement,
is dropped into the confusion. The
tangle is presented and solved in “The
Blue Dahlia” (Prince Edward), with Alan
Ladd and Veronica Lake filling the main
roles. Both action and dialogue are sharp
and brisk, and there’s a businesslike
ferocity in some byplay with guns, sand-
bags and fists.

The main purpose of “Yolanda and

SPORTING NOTIONS
YOUR SHOUT!
AND IT'S
RED MILL RUM.
The anguished voice from the pocket was
loud in the land at Caulfield on Saturday when
National Hurdle winner Solvent managed to
finish only, a distant third in the Australian
Hurdle for which he started favorite at
2 to 1. The winner, ridden by E. Wilson, was
the S.A. jumper First Aid, an expensive failure
for Melbourne punters more than once since
coming over. Those who backed First Aid to
second favoritism were presumably not among
the many who gathered to hurl abuse after the
race. The disturbance lasted a long time, and
an inquiry was opened and adjourned.
Dandenong toppled at the first jump, over
which Jocularity and Edigram led the field, with
Solvent handy. All the time Solvent was pulling
hard, striving to get to the front, and that
may have been his undoing under topweight
burden of 11.10. Walladale dropped his rider
nine furlongs from home, and shortly after
John Masefield followed suit. Round the last
turn the field was bunching up, with Ration,
Solvent, Jocularity and First Aid making a line
of four, but on straightening up First Aid
fairly bolted away to pass the judge eight
lengths ahead of Jocularity, with a further
four lengths to Solvent, followed by Gyrone.
As it was last year, when Duomint was the
winner, the distance was two miles five fur-
longs and 65 yards. On only those two occa-
sions has that particular distance been run
over hurdles at Caulfield, and First Aid knocked
four and a quarter seconds off Duomint’s time.
The Australian Hurdle has been run at a
variety of distances since the race was instituted
in 1892, when Tim Swiveller was the winner
over two and a quarter miles. In 1897 they
tried a four-mile trip, and His Grace wpn that
marathon in 8.7-T A year later the journey
was reduced to a shade under three and a half
miles and remained at that until further reduced
to a little over three and a quarter miles in
1925. In 1926 they were accidentally sent off
from the wrong barrier, and so travelled the old
course over three and a half miles less 90 yards.
The winner was Roisel, who might well have
known the way round, having won over the old
distance five years previously. Thereafter the
only change prior to the present distance being
adopted was during the war years 1940-43
when the race was run at Flemington over three
miles.
• ••••«
The Godfrey Watson Steeple resulted in a
close finish, in which only a half-length
separated the winner, Quixotic (R. Hall), and
New Zealander, Gay Fort, but otherwise it was
a singularly poor race. Gay Fort, who was the
medium of a considerable betting plunge and
apparently a good thing beaten, shared the lead
most of the way with Accelerate. By the time
they had made half the second circuit the field
was strung out over almost two furlongs. Most
of them had no chance by then, and Gay Fort
looked the winner until Quixotic cpmmenced
to move up rounding the turn. Quixotic had
the best of a close finish, with Accelerate next
and the rest at intervals of dozens of lengths.
It was a good run by Quixotic for neA Satur-
day’s Australian Steeple, in which he goes up
only a couple of pounds. However, Tente’s
form has been excellent for the big event, and
Victory March could also enter info it. Taking
a pick before acceptances: Tente, 1; Quixotic,
2; Victory March, 3.
Another New Zealander, First In, had better
luck in the 12-furlongs’ Balaclava Stakes. A
six-year-old mare by Siegfried, from Gobble,
First In was ridden on Saturday by a New
Zealand rider, A. Didham, who brought her
a change of luck, and she comfortably ac-
counted for Macclesfield and Space.
Ridden by D. Richards, Glenfem, a four-year-
old entire by Valiant Chief, continued his run of
success, taking the first division of the six-
furlongs’ Moondah Plate. There were 19
starters, and the betting accurately reflected
their chances, being 8 to 1 bar one, with Glen-
fem at 11 to 8. Dual Gift and Enthuse shared
in the finish. The second division went to the
aged Windbag gelding Lone Wind (D. Snart),
who accounted for Sunrocks and the favorite
Dampier.
In the Mornington Welter the betting was 7
to 1 bar one, but the “good thing,” Big Shot,
went down, Night Guardian (V. Hartney),
winning from Judith Louise and Verdict. The
Elstemwick Stakes for three-year-old fillies went
to San Fairy Anne (V. Hartney), which, though
very fatniliar to Old Diggers, sounds nowa-
days more like a joke on the register than the
name of a horse. She started equal favorite
with Sasti, and disposed of Fairy’s Flight and
Our Love.
* * * *
Sydney’s first day’s racing of the new season,
an S.T.C. meeting at Moorefield, saw two jockeys
off to a good start —Thompson and Moore,
each with three winners, giving some food for
thought to the many lads who failed to land
that many in the entire season just concluded.
Cook and G. Podmore supplied the other two
on the card of eight races, divisions having been
necessary in the Welter and Three-year-old
Maiden.
Thompson’s treble included the main double,
the Flying and S.T.C. Handicaps. He brought
home the favorite in each, and both times more
credit was due to rider than to horse. Starting
at 7 to 4, Brazier was considered the best pros-
pect of the seven in the Flying, and Thompson
had him smartly away after the start had been
considerably delayed by the antics of Strauss, a
regular barrier rogue with whom the starter
may one day lose all patience. Strauss and
Chantilly disputed the lead to the home turn,
where Strauss was going much the better and
was a clear leader at the distance ; but, hard
ridden over the final half-furlong, Brazier just
got there to win by a half-neck, Chantilly hang-
ing on to finish third.
The Brueghel horse Active Service was favor-
ite for the Club Handicap, again contested by
a small field. When they left the starter Turn
Again showed anxiety to make the running, but
Twice Royal got to the front and set a brisk
pace, being three lengths clear at the turn.
Active Service had Twice Royal beaten half-
way down the straight, only to be in turn
tackled by the lightly weighted Marcontine, and
that pair staged a fine tussle to the post. Mere
yards from the finish Marcontine was in front,
but Thompson, who seldom deals out unneces-
sary punishment, drove Active Service over the
line to win by a head. Twice Royal outlasted
Turn Again for third place. The time for the
ten furlongs, 2.6 i, was only the traction outside
the course record established try a notable
Moorefield specialist, Cavedweller, in 1930.
With its peculiarities of a pronounced uphill
back-stretch and downhill finish, Moorefield is
a track where the horses-for-courses maxim is
particularly applicable. Some gallopers revel
m the down-graded straight ; others don’t know
what to make of it. An example of the latter
on Saturday was El Grandee, a hot favorite for
the Welter first division. Thompson gave him
every chance, holding him in behind Gold Caste
to the turn, and then scooting him away to a
lead in which he looked home and hosed. But
when El Grandee struck the downhill going he
stopped as if shot, and was an easy mark for
Fine Art, finishing on well. Oliver took third
money.
Thompson had better luck in the second
division of the same event, riding a brilliant
finish on Battle King to just down Doubloon
and Chatlock.
“I'm tossin it in. He keeps aimin' at you an hittin me!"
Only four, all four-year-olds, faced the
starter for the Three- and Four-year-old Handi-
cap, and W. Cook on the favorite, Edinburgh,
gave the apprentice lads on the other three a
riding lesson. Pearl Trader and Marshal lito
shared the lead during the first half of the
mile, but when the lads on this pair attempted
to slow down the field and take a breather up
the hill at the back the race was over. Cook
instantly shot Edinburgh up from last to lead
clearly round the turn, and he had an unbeat-
able break when they entered the straight,
winning by four lengths from Pearl Trader and
Cavalero. . .
The first two races on the card, divisions of
a Maiden Three-year-old, set the books oft on
the winning side. In the first division the Royal
Step horse Monogram (G. Moore) accounted
for the favorite, Karitane, and the second favor-
ite, Duotetra. In the second division the favor-
ite, Murmur (a promising full sister to
Shannon), and the public’s second fancy, Grand
City, were defeated by a 33-to-l chance, Dark
Marne (G. Podmore). Bracketed with Mar-
coni Lass, Dark Marne returned £9 12s. for
ss. on the win tote,
At 5 to 1 Pennicuik was third choice in
betting on the Encourage, but he was a second-
to-none chance when Moore had him close to
the front at the turn. He had previously shown
great liking for the downhill run, and romped
home from Avalanche and Midlander.

The bank holiday allowed racing at Rand-
wick on Monday, with two of the most
esting events for future reference, the Tellers
Handicap over 6 furlongs 19 yards for three-
year-old fillies and the Staff Handicap (7 fur-
longs 22 yards) for colts and geldings of that
age In the Tellers’ Duotetra, a filly by Nizami-
Astrath, won from the Mid Kent filly Novem-
ber and the Talking filly. Vagitus. Duotetra
came with a fine run in the straight and
appeared to be going away from them at tne
end.
In the Staff Handicap the winner was the
Bullhead colt Clipper, who started from a wide
barrier position.

Some owners who have been associated with
racing for decades must often feel a little gnm
over the luck of the game. The leading owner
in Australia for the 1945-46 season was O. R.
Porter, who first saw his colors successiiu in
1943. Last season his horses won £20,832 in
Melbourne and Adelaide, including the Caul-
field Cup by St. Fairy. Next to him was
Romano, who early in the season paid 2600
guineas for Bernborough, subsequent winner of
the best part of £20,000.
* * * *
For a horse that came to Australia almost by
accident in the first place, Dhotr has P[ ove “
an extraordinarily successful sire. His stock last
season ran 33 firsts and a dead-heat, and with
placings bagged over £25,000. Two of the best
of the breed have been Royal Gem and
Leonard. „

Horses in America are getting names of
several words to cart around. A current list
includes Be Courageous, Big and Better, Be
Sure Now and Bymeabond. A while back it
was tried in Sydney by Phar Lao’s old pilot
Jim Pike, two of them being Hole in One
and Two Ton Tony; the latter went to America,
wmch seemed odd on ms lorm here, and no-
thing has since been heard of him.

A third of the 100,000 who turned out
to watch the six V.F.L. games on Satur-
day chose Footscray-Richmond as the
match of the day, since Richmond had to
win it to get into the “four.” The Tigers
never looked like getting in, Footscray
holding the lead all the way to win by
14.15 to 12.21. Melbourne could have
made the “four” by beating South
Melbourne, but was itself stoushed
by 15.16 to 14.11. This left Carlton,
beaten 14.10-11.8 by Fitzroy, safe, the
“four” being Essendon, Footscray, Col-
lingwood and Carlton. Essendon and
Collingwood had easy wins against Haw-
thorn and St. Kilda respectively (21.18-
12.7 and 15.24-10.9) and North Melbourne
indulged in some accurate goal-kicking
against Geelong, 15.10-6.12. It pretty
nearly needs a miracle to displace any or
the leaders now.

M.C.C. team for Australia:
To the dozen already chosen the selectors
last week added R. Pollard (Lancashire) and
T. P. Smith (Essex),, both right-hand bowlers
with good form this season. Pollard has taken
7 for 49 v. India, 7 for 82 v. Gloucester and
8 for 127 v. Middlesex; and Smith has match
efforts of 11 for 119 v. Surrey and 10 for 80
v. Northants. Smith had tour experience with
Tennyson’s team in India.in 1938 and Calm s
XI in M.L. in 1939.
Of the chosen 14 only Evans (25), Bedser
(27) and Compton and Ikin (each 28) are under
30; nine others are in their thirties, and Ham-
mond is 43. In England, however, few of the
youngsters have had much chance as yet to
make good after war service.
One thing notably lacking in the side is a
good left-hand batsman. In past years the left-
handers have been very useful men, among them
Leyland, Woolley and Chapman (England) and
Hill, Darling and Bardsley (Australia). •
Also there is no fflst bowler in the side.
Bedser, Voce and Pollard are fast-medium, and
Wright, Smith, Ikin and Compton are slow
bowlers of different types. AH are right-handers
except Voce and Compton.

“Short-leg”: Bill Voce, in the M.C.C. 14
to tour Australia, is the unluckiest of Eng-
lish cricketers. He was at his top in 1929 (iu/
wickets) and 1930 (76 wickets), but when he
was in the running for the third Test the Aus-
tralians met Notts and Voce was belted for
4 for 86 and 1 for 112, chiefly by McCabe
and Richardson. Voce has repped for England
in S’Africa, but never in England. Now, at
37, he is to be asked to take on a young man’s
job.

The Rugby Union trial game for the
N.Z. tour, Australia v. The Rest, had the
spectators on their toes in the second half J
At half-time Australia was in front 19-16.

try after try, winning 30-22. N.S.W,
trounced Combined States, 28-11.

The leading Swedish tennis tourna-
ment, held at Baastad, provided a con-
solation prize for the Australian Geoff
Brown after his rather stiff luck at
Wimbledon. Once again Brown over-
shadowed Pails. In the semi-finals of
the singles Brown eliminated his team-
mate Harper, while the Swedish Davis
Cup player Johansson disposed of Pails.
Meeting Johansson in the final, Brown
started nervously, losing the first set 1-6,
but then, finding touch, he went on to
take the next three 6-4, 6-0, 6-2. Brown’s
terrific wallops baffled the Swedes, who
are accustomed to a different style of
play on their slower courts. The final of
the doubles was an all-Australian affair.
Brown and Hopman beating Pails and
Harper. In this match against team-
mates it was reported that Pails produced
the best tennis yet seen from him over-
seas, which seems to support the sugges-
tion that he lacks confidence in interna-
tional play.

Giving away inches in height and
reach to Eric Macready at Leichhardt,
Dally Moran (Bst. 1311 b.) looked like
winning despite these handicaps. He
landed many straight lefts from which
Macready, though boxing on the retreat,
could not get away. A change came
over the scene in the fifth round when
a furious right had Moran “out on his
feet.” He was still in that condition when
he came up for the sixth, and another
right knocked him down for nine seconds.
The referee should have halted the pro-
ceedings then, but he allowed Macready
to floor Moran again before applying the
closure.
The “no-foul” rule was observed and
then ignored during the fight between
Joe Hall and Charlie Ashenden at the
Sydney Stadium. It was an exciting affair,
marred by the veteran’s failure to “keep’em
up.” He was adjudged to have lost all the
points of the third round for twice landing
low with lefts., Busy little Ashenden was
twice floored, with well-timed rights be-
fore a butt gashed Hall’s left eyebrow,
then crashed him canvaswards, in the
fifth round. He not only beat the count,
but rose full of fight; however, three
more lefts landed below the Adelaidean s
belt-line before a fourth sent him down
in agony in the ninth, and Hall was outed
on a foul. Just before the unsatisfactory
finish Ashenden was fighting strongly, and
it is many years since a better Adelaide
pug came east.

Buying-power and Production
Between June, 1939, and June, 1945,
the total of notes held by the Australian
public, deposits in the central bank,
trading and savings banks rose from £613
million to £1357 million. Over the past
12 months there has been a further ex-
pansion of these public savings by be-
tween £l5O -million and £2OO million,
making present accumulated buying-
power in the hands of the people more
than £l5OO million. The expansion in
spending and investment-money available
since war began has thus been in the
nature of one and a half times.
Compare this with the production avail-
able for purchase. To begin with, coal
was being produced at the rate of
1.016.000 tons a month in 1938-39, while
in 1944-45 the rate was still little beyond
that level—actually 1,064,000 tons a
month, though in 1942-43 an average of
1.201.000 tons had been achieved. Dur-
ing 1945-46 monthly output averaged
less than 1,000,000 tons.. Pig-iron and
steel production lately has also averaged
less than before the war. Butter output
has declined over the past seven years,
and there has been no expansion in flour-
milling. Total meat production grew
from a monthly mean of 80,533 tons in
1938-39 to no more than 82,004 tons in
1944-45, and during 1945-46 the average
slumped to under 70,000 tons. Building
activity, as is well known, is a shadow
of what it used to be, and building costs
are rarely less than 50 p.c. above the
pre-war level.
What a reflection on the economic
behavior of a country the population of
which has grown considerably during
the war and the Government of which
boasts that it has given employment to
hundreds of thousands of extra people
since war began, reducing trade-union un-
employment from 9.3 p.c. to 1.4 p.c.!
What is the use of this “employment” if
it does not bring proportionately greater
output? It is obvious that unless we do
get this output the great pressure of in-
flated war-time buying power will send
prices soaring, bringing hardship and loss
to those relying on earnings and savings.
The people, including all economic and
industrial classes, have at their disposal
even greater potential spending-power
than the £l5OO million indicated. Over
£lOOO million has been raised by “public”
borrowing operations during the war, the
greater proportion of it certainly held by
banks and life-assurance offices. But
enough of it has been subscribed by indi-
viduals and industrial enterprises to
suggest future credit expansion of a
considerable amount unless bank ad-
vances on the security of Government
stock is prohibited for years to come.
In spite of all our “employment,” all
our “money,” we are failing to get the
production upon which both living stan-
dards and social security depend. Not
only that, we are failing to capture those
overseas markets which are now clamor-
ing for our products. For these failures
industrial indiscipline is largely to blame.
And for that a Government at Canberra
constituted mainly of political adven-
turers, ready to barter the national good
for mere tenure in office, is chiefly re-
sponsible. But the results of the “policy”
by which it clings to office by now are
alarming even many of those who in the
past supported it in what seemed to be
their own selfish interests.
The Double-taxation Arrangement
Agreement has been reached between
Australia and Britain on the double-
taxation question. So far as British cos.
having a “permanent establishment” in
Australia are concerned, they will pay
all Australian company taxation —or-
dinary company tax, super-tax, undistri-
buted-profits tax, social-services contri-
bution and war-time (company) tax—
but Britain will give full credit for these
taxes in assessing British tax on the profits
A “permanent establishment” is de-
fined as a branch or other fixed place ol
business, and will include a management,
factory, mine or rural property. This
priority of tax in the country of income
origin will not apply to shipping and air-
transport dividends, literary and indus-
trial royalties, pensions and purchased
annuities arid certain agencies.
In the case of a British company
operating a subsidiary in
Australia, the subsidiary will be obliged
to pay all relevant company taxes, but
Australia will not levy tax on the divi-
dends transmitted to Britain. In the case
of other dividends paid by Australian
cos. to British shareholders, the Com-
monwealth will take half the usual tax
on the div. British companies that are
private companies under Australian law
will continue to pay undistributed-profits
tax at full rates regardless of exemptions
and reductions. When an individual
shareholder in Britain receives a div. out
of Australian income the U.K. Govern-
ment will give a credit for the Australian
tax.
If Australian shareholders receiving
divs. from British cos. elect to include in
their assessable income the British tax
appropriate to the divs. they will be
allowed a credit of the British tax from
the Australian tax payable on the div.
The agreement between the British and
Australian Treasuries is for 10 years
certain, and will thereafter continue in-
definitely unless terminated by either
party. Income earned in Australia
during the year ended June 30, 1946,
will be covered.
Some arrangement of the kind now de-
cided upon has been absolutely essential
to Empire industrial development. Aus-
tralian company taxation is so severe
that British enterprises paying U.K. taxes
as well have had very little to pass on to
their shareholders, however prosperous
their undertakings have been. Last year,
for instance, the Zinc Corporation paid
taxes of £354,686 on profits of £482,064.
And shareholders had again to pay tax
on divs. when received.
Greater development of the Zinc Corp.
and New Broken Hill mines has partly
depended on the elimination of double-
tax bleeding. Mt. Isa, in Queensland,
has been awaiting this kind of relief in
order to go ahead with a big copper-
production plan. Development of Cen-
tral Norseman and other London-con-
trolled Westralian gold shows has
hinged on the same thing. Manufactur-
ing interests like Courtaulds, the rayon
people, will also be now in a better posi-
tion ito determine whether it will be
worth while trying to establish them-
selves in McKell country.
Overseas trade in the 1945-46 financial
year resulted in a favorable balance of
£2O million for the Commonwealth, in-
cluding £27 million of gold exported
(almost no gold was dispatched overseas
in the previous year). In the preceding
term the adverse balance was £Bl
million. Both periods included lend-
lease items, but in 1944-45 lend-lease
imports by Australia were much greater
than in the past year ; this partly accounts
for the big adverse balance. The whole
lend-lease position, involving aid to us
valued by U.S. authorities at $l5OO mil-
lion and aid by us valued at £285 mil-
lion, has been settled by a Common-
wealth cash payment of £8.4 million.
During the lend-lease period, however,
aid rendered to us figured largely in our
imports, while our reciprocal aid was
mostly given to U.S. forces within the
Commonwealth, not exported, thus giving
a disproportionate weight to our import
figures that did not show up in the real
annual balance of payments. It can
therefore be taken that the apparent ex-
ternal trade improvement in 1945-46 is to
an extent misleading because of lend-
lease confusion, and also because of the
crediting of £27-million-worth of gold
in June this year—equal to more than
three years’ production. On the other
hand, exports, including gold, during
1945-46 totalled £216 million, compared
with £155 million in the preceding year ;
obviously there is real expansion here.
The central-bank return recently showed
the holding of gold and sterling balances
abroad to be £2ll million. It has fluctu-
ated around £2OO million for some months
past, settlement of war-time indebtedness
between Australia and Britain having no
marked influence. Most of the gold ex-
ports in June, too, had been already paid
for by Britain.

, The Federal Government is toying with
the idea of running a permanent Com-
monwealth coastal shipping line, even to
the exclusion of private competitors. Be-
fore proceeding one further step it should
reveal to the people its actual losses on
shipping operations during the war and
after.

Last year . expenditure from the
National Welfare Fund was £53 million
—nearly £l2 million under Budget esti-
mates. The proposed pharmaceutical
benefits (set down at a million) were
found to be unconstitutional, and only a
little over a million was paid out in un-
employment and sickness benefits (against
an estimate of £9.5 million). No tuber-
culosis claims were paid, and there were
no rental rebates under the Housing
Agreement; together, this represented a
retention of £500,000 in the fund. In-
stead of the National Welfare Fund be-
ing drawn on for £lB.B million, it was
reduced by only £6.6 million, while Con-
solidated Revenue was charged with
£500,000 more than was originally
planned—a total of £46.5 million. The
National Welfare Fund at June 30 was
in credit to the approximate extent of
£47 million. It was built up during the
war years out of taxation, the money
being loaned to the Government for ex-
penditure on war. Now it is being partly,
financed by the social services contribu-
tion, which is taxation levied at Is. 6d. in
the pound on incomes of £220 and over,
with lower rates on smaller incomes.
• * * *
In 1938-39 invalid and old-age pensions
cost the Commonwealth £l6 million. Last
year the cost was £27 million. Child-
endowment was a State matter in 1938-39,
so far as it went; last year it ran into
£lB million, met, as to £ll million, by
payroll tax. The National Welfare Fund
does not provide for servicemen’s pen-
sions. They appear in the public accounts
under the heading of war and repatria-
tion. In the current financial year Mr.
Chifley anticipates that actual payments
made out of the fund will rise by £2l
million, of which £l6 million will have to
be provided from taxation, making,
apparently, a total charge of £62.5 million
on Consolidated Revenue and £11.5 mil-
lion on the accumulated resources of the
fund itself. Even at £74 million a year
we appear to be only just beginning to
pay for free-bottle-of-medicine and other
trumpery benefits that are mixed up with
pensions, etc., that are admittedly neces-
sary up to a point.

With the Federal elections only a
couple of months away, the Canberra
Government has offered to advance
£20,000 to Ora Banda Amalgamated
(W.A.). Triton Gold Mines, operating at
Cue, has also been promised £70,000 for
development. The Australian mining in-
dustry has been given very little con-
sideration’ by the present Government,
and it was about to leave up in the air
copper-producers who had been en-
couraged to enter high-cost production
in order to overcome war-time scarcity
until public outcry caused it to modify
its plans. The gold tax is still levied on
goldmining, last year taking £350,000,
mostly from Westralia. It is high time
Canberra began to regard the goldmining
industry as something other than a poli-
tical football. During war-time, with
lend-lease in operation, gold mqy have
rightly had a low priority on the produc-
tion list. But times have changed, and
mining the yellow metal becomes an ex-
cellent means of obtaining badly-needed
dollars. The industry will have increased
production costs to contend with,-how-
ever, and it is ’hardly the time to be
battening on it for half the excess over
£9 an ounce received for gold,

The United States does not propose
to lower taxation rates in the 1947 Budget
year in view of the inflationary conditions
prevailing; instead, it aims to reduce the
national debt by a large amount. U.S.
income taxes, however, all through the
war were lower than in Australia, Britain
or Canada, and there was a reduction in
rates at the beginning of 1946. For the
purposes of comparison New York State
taxes are included with the U.S. Federal
rate.

Victoria Gold Dredging has declared a
div. of Is. a share, the same as last year.
Apparently more was expected in some
quarters—in 1943-44 a 6s. distribution was
made, and in 1942-43 Bs. In any case,
there has been a slip in the price of Gold
Exploration shares in London from
around 14s. sterling to nearer 12s, Gold
Exploration owns 44 p.c. of the stock of
Victoria Gold Dredging. It also has in-
terests (97 p.c.) in Western Mining Corp.,
Gold Mines of Kalgoorlie (30 p.c.), Tri-
ton (26 p.c.). Gold Mines of Australia
(62 p.c.) and an indirect but large holding
in Central Norseman. G.E. also holds,
until March 31, 1948, a par option over
2,000,000 ss. shares in Central Norseman.
Phoenix Mines is entitled to participate to
the extent of three out of every 16 shares
acquired. Gold Exploration shares have
been supported in London lately by Aus-
tralian investors. Its finances have been
progressively strengthened.

Offshoot of an Australian company
successfully operated by Korman
brothers, who founded Centenary Wool-
len Mills Pty., Victoria, Korma Textiles
(N.Z.), Ltd,, plans to build in Auckland
the largest textile factory in New Zea-
land. When the company made its first
issue of shares in June by inviting the
public to subscribe £125,000 of 5 p.c.
preference capital at par applications for
over a million pounds were lodged in two
hours. With more than 4000 applicants
and with the amount oversubscribed by
more than eight to one, the company had
a sizeable problem on its hands. By
means of ballots and other allotment
methods the total number of applicants
who received allocations- was 2200, the
majority having 50 shares, with the maxi-
mum 500.
A reserve fund of £12,500, sufficient
to pay more than two years’ dividends,
was created from profits earned by
Korma Mills, Ltd., a subsidiary of the
new concern. Korma Textiles has an
authorised capital of £400,000, of which
£75,000 has been allotted in purchase of
Korma Mills, Ltd., and £50,000 has been
taken up by the vendors. This makes
a total of £250,000 capital raised, in
equal amounts of pref. and ord. Con-
struction of a textile mill on a site of
16i acres in the suburbs of Auckland has
been started, where plant will be installed
for worsted spinning, hosiery manufac-
ture and weaving of rayon fabrics. Jim
Gentles, chairman of a number of Auck-
land companies, is head of the Korma
directorate.

An exporter con easily have trouble obtaining
payment for the goods he ships. That is one
reason why I bank at the "Wales". With its
branches in London and over 7,000 agents and
correspondents throughout the world, the
Bank's facilities for collecting payments over-
seas are unsurpassed.
Another reason is that I owe many of my best
oversea connections to the trade introduction
service of the "Wales".
Then, again, the "Wales" has specialized
foreign exchange and letters of credit depart-
ments at all main centres. These departments
are always willing to assist me with foreign
exchange problems.
Take my advice: safeguard your business and
enhance your prestige by letting the largest
commercial bank in the South-West Pacific handle
your oversea transactions.

Forestry-bond Companies
Forestry-bond concerns, the first of
which were formed over 20 years ago,
are still failing to substantiate prospectus
forecasts and salesmen’s promises. The
leading example, New Zealand Forest
Products, is quoted on ’Change at no
higher than 6s. for its £1 ordinary shares
and 10s. for the prefs. The co. has never
paid a dividend, pref. or ord., though
N.Z. Perpetual Forests, its forerunner,
paid divs, out of its organising activities,
not from forestry operations.
Whakatane Paper Mills, formerly
Timberlands Woodpulp, is another Maori-
land example of early promises failing to
materialise. The present management
appears to be doing its best to extract
profits from the turning of pine-trees into
woodpulp and cardboard, but profits re-
main small in relation to the £2,055,964 of
paid capital. No ord. div. had been paid
up to last balance day, while pref. div.
arrears then “did not exceed £90,000.”
True, both N.Z. Forest Products and
Whakatane have been subject to severe
price-control since they began their
limited mill production. The New Zea-
land Government has not been sympa-
thetic in their difficulties, either as regards
the importation of plant or the prices
they could have got during the war-time
scarcity of supplies. There was so much
ballyhoo and extravagance in the early
activities of most bond-selling forestry
concerns that they have a lot to live down
politcally; this, plus the socialistic view
taken by the M.L, Government, has been
a burden to carry now that production
is in progress on a limited scale. Obvi-
ously the Government has little sympathy
for the investors, deluded or otherwise, who
put up their money in the dimming past;
like the Commonwealth Government, it
has little regard for investors anyway.
That is the sad thing about these
forestry propositions ; investors have had
a poor deal in every way. Whakatane
ords. are quoted at under 6s. on ’Change.
Pacific Forests ords., though seldom
quoted, have changed hands at under 10s.
It is even more difficult to find a market
for holdings in Putaruru Pine and Pulp,
Afforestation (Aust.) Pty., and other New
Zealand forestry concerns. Then there
was a crop of Australian ventures—
Queensland Forests, Ltd., and its satellite
cos., and others independent of it. The
years roll by, and the pot of gold is still
at the foot of the rainbow. Nearly all
of the concerns have the trees they con-
tracted to plant, but it is proving difficult
indeed to extract the £250 to £5OO profit
per acre that was generally held out as
waiting for speculators after 20 years.
Millions of pounds were put into these
ventures altogether. The question now
arises as to whether the post-war era
holds anything more promising for the
speculators. It may be easier to get plant
from overseas, and there may be an in-
creased demand for paper and cellulose
products. The concern most likely to
lead the way is N.Z. Forest Products.
But all are going to find the high capital-
isation of the forests a load to carry.
The British-Canadian wheat contract
seems to envisage a fall in wheat prices
over the next four years. The price laid
down for the first two is 9s. Bd. a
bushel in Australian money; for the
third year the minimum price is 7s,
lOd. a bushel, in the fourth year 6s. 3d.
Though stipulated prices in the two later
years are minimum, they appear to indi-
cate the trend anticipated. The United
States is expecting a record wheat yield
in the present season, but it should be re-
membered that the 1945 crop, of only
slightly smaller dimensions than that now
being harvested, was used up rapidly as
pig and cattle food under the Govern-
merit’s policy of cheap feed for farm
animals. Over 1942 to 1944 Canada had
record crops of wheat, but, because of
the need for meat in Britain, the Govern-
ment encouraged the growing of coarse
grains as food for livestock, and wheat
sowings were actually restricted. Neverthe-
less, over the three years to July 31, 1946,
Canada has exported about 1000 million
bushels of wheat —roughly 1,000,000
bushels each working day. All war-time
accumulations of wheat have now been
moved out of Canadian elevators.

Pioneer of coastal shipping and a
power in the transport of goods and pas-
sengers in the days before railway and
road competition became intense, the 65-
year-old Northern Steamship Company,
Ltd., of Auckland, N.Z., plans to break
new ground in a bid for trade further
afield. Chairman E. H. Rhodes says the
company is probing into the possibilities
of extending operations to the South
Seas and of pushing well beyond its
present coastal-trade limits. Knight
Ernest Davis, who was chairman for
many years until E. H. Rhodes took oyer
in 1545, says the major problem is ships,
and there’s also a political tangle to
reckon with in the Islands. Government-
operated railways and discriminatory
freight rates, which have struck the
Northern Co. hard, have been a force
driving it to look for opportunities be-
yond Maoriland.

Canberra Labor, in addition to the
£42 million of uncollected taxes and a
similar or greater amount unassessed,
appears to have another large financial
nest-egg in the shape of uncollected
revenue from disposals of war equip-
ment. It seems that in 1945-46 at least
£5O-million-worth of surplus stuff was
sold, while less than £l6 million was
credited in the public accounts. It would
be all very fine if these reserves were
used to strengthen the national finances
by being applied towards tax-reduction
or debt-redemption. But Chifley and Co.
use them instead to finance their politi-
cal adventures and vote-buying schemes.

In explaining the terms of an issue to
provide for the acquisition of the Cable and
Wireless holdings in Marconi’s Wireless
Telegraph Co., the Chairman of the English
Electric Co. (Sir George H. Nelson) said;
As you are aware, the price at which
ordinary shares can today be issued is sub-
ject to very rigid Government control, and
is, in practice, determined largely by the
price at which existing shares are quoted on
the Stock Exchange. The price of 575. 6d.
at which these shares will be offered is the
lowest price at which we have been able to
obtain the consent of the Capital Issues
Committee.
The shares are of £1 each. The British
Treasury’s objective in insisting that new
industrial issues be put out at a pre-
mium is to reduce the yield to investors
to a point where it will not be too com-
petitive with Government loans. The
Commonwealth Treasury is also said to
favor the charging of premiums on high-
grade industrial issues, several cases be-
ing recorded’ lately.


ABORIGINALITIES
“Zake”: The post-
splitter had been hang-
ing around for a couple
of days recovering from
the effects of a once-
healthy cheque. When
he started to make a
nuisance of himself around the pub
the constable came up. “Look,” he said
sternly, “We’ve just about had enough
of you around here. Now I’ll give you
half an hour, and if by that time you’re
not outside the town boundaries I’ll run
you in, and that will probably mean a
couple of days on the station woodheap.”
The post-splitter slowly looked up the
hamlet’s only street, at the pub, the store-
CM/n-post office, the butcher’s, baker’s and
blacksmith’s which constituted the entire
business and residential sections. Then
he proceeded to stretch out in the shade
of a peppercorn. “Okay, constable —give
us a call in 29 minutes, will y’?” he re-
quested.

“Oxmead”: “Learner-linguist,” discus-
sing variations of diction in different
States, tells us that the bindi-eye of
N.S.W. is identical with the Westralian
double-gee (B. 24/7/’46). I wonder how
many people have been puzzled by the
origin of the latter word. It’s simple
enough when you learn it, but I admit
it took me years to puzzle it out. The
W.A. burr is alleged to have been
imported in a cargo of fodder from South
Africa in the early days of the colony.
The Boer word for the pest is debbilje
(little devil) —appropriate enough, one
must admit. Hence the double-gee, cor-
rupted into a form that gives no clue to
its original derivation and meaning. It
is a curious example of the Australian
habit of forcing a foreign word into some-
thing that can be more easily spoken and
spelled.

“Old-timer”; “Little Curl,” in town
with the wagon and four horses, came
across “Pocket-knife” in the chaffshed
of the pub. “Pocket-knife” was on the
verge of recovery from a lengthy bender
and “Little Curl,” who was ever out to
help a friend, spread a few bags in the
bottom of the wagon, loaded “Pocket-
knife” on to them, stacked the station
supplies around him and set off for home.
Several times he tried to make conversa-
tion, but all he could get from his pas-
senger were moans and grunts or dead
silence. About three miles out a big
willy-willy shrieked down upon the team,
wrapping a couple of empty kero.-tins
around the leaders’ heads, and they
promptly bolted. Somewhere in their
wild career the offside front wheel hit a
log and “Curl” was shot from the wagon
into the sandhill. He picked himself up.
and tore after the runaways, which had
almost blown themselves Out when the
two offside wheels dropped into a dry
crabhole. The wagon tipped and most
of its load, including “Pocket-knife,”
went slithering over the side. The horses
stopped and stood, shivering and blowing,
as “Little Curl” galloped up. Out of the
ruins arose “Pocket-knife.” “Gripes,” he
said, indignantly, “a man’d be safer walk-
in’ than ridin’ with a mad driver like
you!” He looked around, then started
back to the town. “You tell the boss
I’m waitin’ till he sends someone sensible
t’ bring me home,” he snorted ; and leav-
ing the cursing “Curl” to reload the wagon
“Pocket-knife” headed back.

“Bo”: “I useter have a team o’ sixteen
bullocks out on the Barwon —that was
back in the ’nineties,” old “Cassowary”
Con was saying. “I always slept in a
hammock slung under me j inker, an’ one
mornin’ I wakes up an’ sees a bloke
snoopin’ around. I reckernises him as
'Long’ Jim Brattan, who’d escaped from
clink where he was doin’ a stretch for
cattle duffin’. A nasty cow he was an’ he
was totin’ a gun, but he don’t scarfe me.
I pulls on me rammies, jus’ walks straight
up to him, says ‘sniff this bunch o’ fives’
an’ before he can get his gun going I
lands an uppercut that lifts him about
five-feet orf the ground. When he comes
to I’ve got him lashed securely to one o’
the j inker wheels. Not bad goin’, though
I say it meself, seein’ that Brattan was a
foot higher than me, an’ could give me
about three stone. An’ that’s how I
brought him the 14 miles in to the trooper
at Long Swamps—l got the reward an’
Jim got a headache through goin' round
“Pinch me girl last night at the dance , would yer ?”
an’ round with the wheel.” “A very tall
cove that Brattan, wasn’t he?” asked
Fred the fencer innocently. “My oath he
was!” Con was emphatic. “Must ’a’
gone six foot five if he went an
inch.” “Well, y’re a flamin’ old
liar, ‘Cassowary,’ ” went on Fred
evenly, “because if y’ lashed him
to y’r jinker wheel his head an’
shoulders would’ve stuck out beyond the
rim an’ every time the wheel made a
turn his scone would’ve belted the rodd
an’ he’d have bin a corpse after y’d
gone a few yards.” But “Cassowary”
wasn’t abashed. “I thought o’ that,” he
said, without batting an eyelid. “Y’ see,
I kept the wheel o’ the jinker right on the
edge o’ the road where it was soft sand,
and went ahead scoopin’ a shovelful o’
sand out jus’ where I reckoned his
melon’d come every time the wheel come

“Tick”: When “Lub” (B. 17/7/’46)
was talking about Charlie’s inventions
that didn’t work, he must have forgotten
Charlie’s service in the Army. He be-
came a signaller, and many weird gadgets
sprang from his fertile imagination, but
the Army Inventions Board were never
very impressed. Then one day Charlie
became intrigued with the “world zone
time system,” and started figuring out a
gadget that would simplify the calcula-
tion of what time it would be anywhere
in the world. After several days he pro-
duced his one and only invention that
worked. Charlie was persuaded to apply
for a patent, which he duly did. For
weeks his credit was good for a few bob
anywhere on the strength of what the
Army would pay for it. Then came a
letter from the Patent Office, informing
Charlie that his invention had already
been patented—in 1890!

“Colonial Cove”: If “Lower Tops’l”
(B. 3/7/’46) had made his limpets into
soup he would have found them not only
tastier but also more nourishing. For
centuries during the hard season the
inhabitants of the Western Isles and the
adjacent coast of Scotland used to depend
on the limpet to save them from utter
starvation —which is why the univalve
was so readily recognised by those early
seaiers, quite a few of whom arrived m
Australia from such parts of Caledonia.

“Herbert Dawson”: Lions will have to
do better than three miles to win the
farthest-carrying voice competition (B.
10/7/’46). In the early morning 1 have
heard yarded cattle six miles away in
timbered country. Dogs and crowing
roosters I have heard from a distance of
more than three miles on a frosty night.
But the most misleading call in its sugges-
tion of distance is the emu’s, when he
makes the drumming noise—there are two
quite distinct calls peculiar to the fowl.
I have sneaked across a gully under the
impression that the birds I was stalking
were just on the other side, only to dis-
cover ultimately they were feeding down
another gully more than a mile away
across scrubby ridges. On the other hand
I have placed the drumming call as being
too distant to warrant a search, and then
ridden nearly over the poultry respon-
sible for it before going a hundred yards,
“Betcha”: When it comes to distin-
guishing calls the jumbuck is no slouch.
1 yarded for marking a batch of ewes and
young lambs and turned them out in one
inglorious mix-up: 600-odd ewes bleating
incessantly, and running everywhere, and
as many lambs straining their lungs in a
bedlam of rivalry. One ewe on the out-
skirts began feeding, while near the yards
a small skinful of misery huddled in
silence with a bunch of other lost young-
sters. Presently he raised his head, and
I saw his mouth open in a feeble bleat.
The feeding ewe stopped, then straight as
a die hustled through the milling flock
to claim the miserable specimen. How
those old ewes can distinguish individual
calls in such an infernal racket is a
wonder.

“Lower Tops’l”; Mention of that
cemetery on Gabo (B. 12/6/’46) recalls
another on the north area of Mallacoota
Inlet (Vic.). On that roadless, forest-clad
shore, where are tucked away only two
farmlets, it is a relic of water-transport
days when there was a pub hard by the
Spotted Dog goldmine. Today, the only
indication of this God’s Acre is the name
“Cemetery Bight.” It took exploring in the
forest to find it, as through many bush-
fires all that remains is a bit of fencing
and a burnt stump of a wooden head-
stone. Why the site is up a steep slope
where coffins had to be carried up from
boats on human backs is a mystery.
Buried there are four bodies from the
collier Federal, which foundered with all
hands in March, 1901, off the near-by
rocky coast,

“Mat’s Mate”: “I struck a place once
in South Oss,” said Mat, “an there s
only two blokes on it. One’s the boss,
who ain’t married, an’ the other’s a bloke
he’s got workin’ there. When I got there
the pair of ’em is havin’ a first-class
barney, callin’ each other for everythin
an’ threatenin’ t’ do one another in. I
listen to it for a bit an’ then they sight
me an’ the boss asks what I want, so I
put it on him for a hand-out an’ he tells
the other bloke t’ get it for me. The
bloke gets it, hands it over an’ they start
in on each other again, as though I
wasn’t there, so I shove the tucker in
me nose-bag and drift down the road a
bit an’ camp. Well, about sundown the
bloke comes by on a bike an’ we has a
bit of a yarn an’ I say somethin’ about
workin’ for a bloke who abuses y’ like
that. But this bloke says it’s all right an’
it’s the only time they ever had a row
an’ they get on together all right apart
from that. Well, after that I was over
in Victoria for a coupler years or so an’ I
got a few bob together and went t’ South
Oss for a break. I got a room in a
Adelaide pub an’ that night I hear a
helluva row in the next room so I open
the door. Blow me if there ain’t the
same two coves goin’ for each other flat
out. They stop when I poke me bib in an’
I says to the bloke, ‘Gripes, thought that
row y’ had a coupler years back was the
only one y’ ever had with y’r boss?’ He
glares at me an’ comes back, ‘So it was.
This is the same ruddy row. Now, mind
y’r own business, mate.’ So I ducks out
o’ there quick.”

“Nor’-west”: Am always interested
when I read of someone playing a fish for
an hour or more, like that boy with the
1001 b. Murray cod (B. 3/7/’46), for I
had similar ideas once —until I dropped
my first deep-sea line overside. Instantly
it was seized in a grip that made me
think I had snagged the bed of the ocean.
But once it had recovered from its initial
surprise the 301 b. jewfish quickly in-
formed me otherwise. So with the feel
of holding half a ton I began to “play”
my fish. But the skipper was watching.
“Get it up quick before it has time to
throw the hook,” he ordered. And that’s
how I fished thereafter: skull-dragged
them up hand over hand as quickly as
they’d come and over the combing with
them thrashing all the way like a broken-
winged propeller. Give your* fish any
slack line such as in this “playing” busi-
ness and, unless it had swallowed the
hook right down the gullet, it might
“throw” it and you’ll do your fish in.

“S.G.”: My dozen hens are lorded
over by a white leghorn rooster; a dis-
ciplinarian but a gentleman. When re-
cently one of the hens got an extra large
piece of shell from the grit stuck in her
gizzard and started rushing around
panicky, and on the point of choking his
Nibs took charge of the situation firmly.
Baling her up in a corner he pushed his
beak firmly down her open gob and re-
moved the obstruction. Then he gallantly
proceeded to break up the shell and feed
it to the other ladies of the harem. '

“Hanko”: The binder was rattling
round the last few cuts of the paddock.
Quail began to whirr hither and yon
over the stubble; the dogs became ex-
cited and weaved and leaped in the ribbon
of crop. High on his seat on the binder
the boss pointed with his whip and
mouthed an unheard shouting. A fox
darted out of the crop and as quickly
darted back again. The staghound dived
after it and out came two quail, a
hare and a baby rabbit. The boss pointed
again; shouted ; woke up to himself and
stopped the binder. “Gripes,” he jab-
bered, “There must be a dozen flamin’
foxes in there.” He rattled away and a
half-grown rabbit came out and squeaked
in terror. The dogs ignored it and con-
tinued to weave and leap. The binder
came down the last strip and th- stag-
hound nearly got hamstrung by the
knives. The boss yelled so his hat fell
on to the platform and got bundled and
tied in a sheaf. The last swathe fell and
the binder clattered to a stop. The boss
seemed dazed ; the dogs looked sheepish,
and we’d been watching for foxes and
not stocking. Hurriedly we began to pick
up sheaves.

“Blime”: A bunch of traps on his
saddle, and followed by his new mong,
Ben started off round the back fence. At
the first hole he set a trap, climbed his
nag again, and had gone about 30 yards
when a terrified howl broke loose. Ben
released the mong, assured himself the
paw was unbroken, and reset the trap.
The second trap was pegged at a burrow
some distance up the hillside, and Ben
had barely returned to the fence when a
howl arose from behind him. Patiently
he turned back to release the bleeding paw
once again. Half an hour later the dog
blundered with the other front foot, and
for the rest of the way out he licked his
wounds and whinged along painfully be-
hind the nag. The job finished, Ben was
making home down the line when again
came a wail from the end trap. This
time he picked up a switch and presented
the mong with three or four half-hearted
cuts before setting him free. “Some dogs
is like that,” he remarked to me matter-
of-factly, as he tossed aside the switch.
“Never learn till y’ lam into ’em. It
gives ’em somethin’ t’ remember the
things by,”
THE GREEN GOULBURN RIVER.
Before the last moonrise its mystery spills
On the last winter snowfall away in the hills,
Before the winds tarnish the wattles’ bright
frond
Or buttercups varnish the edge-of-beyond;
Where the water-world spreads into little
lagoons,
Where the swans meet to gossip on slow after-
noons,
You can tell the year’s turning when wattle-
doves cry
Down the green Goulbura River when August
is nigh.
So clear is the wide lift of heaven today,
So gay are the bush lanes that border my way,
The limpid low water runs glassily down,
As green as the emeralds in Oberon’s crown.
And the white cockatoos when a stranger’s step
comes
In winged shrieking silver flap off through the
gums,
Though the alien blackbird still whistles his dear
By the green Goulburn River when August is
here.
Only the birds here now, only the breeze
Setting free and afloat the warm scent of the
trees;
The little blue wrens in the tall bracken’s
groves
Sing gay little songs to their gray little loves;
The blue swallows skim and the blue cranes
belong
To this sky-mirror patch of the blue billabong;
While, far off a murmur and further a sigh,
The green Goulburn River slips quietly by.
I know twenty magpies who live on a farm
In a gap in these foothills, safe sheltered from
harm;
With warbling solo and choral delight
They sing for their living from morning till
night—
Before the red morning is etched through the
boughs,
Until the last milker has turned out the cows;
While two kookaburras laugh world-without-end
Where the green Goulburn River slides round
the green bend.
There are overdressed orchards and acres of
frills
From here to the grape-bloom that covers the
hills;
The peaches are patches of rose-red and pink;
Like curtseying ladies the plums dip and sink
In their flowing court dresses, all flounced to
the knees;
And silent bells peal on the white cherry trees.
But the eucalypts’ arches smell freshest of all
Where the green Goulburn River runs through
the green wall.

“Gravelsnatcher”: After 10 weary
months spent trapping bunnies Bill, holi-
day bent, headed his ancient runabout
towards Perth. It was a nightmare
journey, with frequent pauses while the
engine cooled off, and many a tramp to
dams well off the track for a kerosene-
tin of water, but the contraption had
been Bill’s sole companion for so long
that he’d have felt lost without it. Finding
a city pub whose proprietor was prepared
to find a room for a man with a fortune
to spend, he crawled in between sheets for
the first time in a year and started to
catch up on lost sleep. Halfway through
the night he suddenly awoke, leapt out of
bed, and stood, sniffing and trying to get
his bearings. Then, comprehension dawn-
ing, he got back into bed and dropped
off to sleep with a beatific smile on his
face. He was still smiling when they
rushed in to tell him the pub was on
fire, and, grabbing his few belongings,
he went down the fire-escape and joined
the crowd on the footpath. , “I smelt
somethin’ burnin’ ’bout an hour ago,” he
confided to the publican, as they watched
the blaze. “What! ” howled that worthy.
“Then why the blazes didn’t you let us
know?” “Yairs,” Bill admitted. “I
s’pose I should’ve, but it was just bonzer
bein’ able t’ smell somethin’ gettin’ hot
an’ know it wasn’t my old bus.”

“Fancar”: Over 100 years ago
botanists put forward a very feasible
theory that the edibility of certain birds’
nests (B. 10/7/’46) was due to a type of
gelidium, a cellular plant of the algae
kind, which found a perfect home in the
saliva the swifts employ so much in nest-
building. Singularly, the best substitute
Chinese epicures have found for edible
birds’ nests is Sphcerococcus cartilagi-
neous, a cousin of carrageen or Irish moss
and an important member of the algae
family.

“D.R.H.”: This year the winter rains
have missed our corner of S.A.
Down on the plains there are great
stretches of bare, worked-up land, some
of it seeded but all of it void of any
green shoot. On the other hand, in the
missus’s garden there is a fine stand of
silver beet, the leaves of which are
dotted here and there with little red spots.
“Any chance of a lift, mate?”
Each one of those spots is a cluster of
minute stalks bearing hundreds of red-
dish rust spores. Down in the tissues of
the leaves beneath each spore cluster is a
twining mass of “feeding threads”—for
rust is a fungus growth—cunningly
twisted about the living cells of the beet
and sending robber threads into the very
protoplasm of each cell. Rust finds silver
beet or the marshmallows by the creek

terval between one wheat crop and the

E. A. Ker : I wouldn t contest a y-
thing reputed of white cockatoos (B.
10/7/ 46). !er f, was the ]
looking creature that pined in its cage
at the door of the produce store.
When, at its sad request, I poked my
finger through the mesh to scratch the
bird’s itchy-looking poll, my reward was
a bite that removed a full inch of skin,
and a chatty observation concerning the
weather. Peter, another cocky in my life,
bore his name and his secret for 21 yeais
before he laid her first egg. To all
appearances friendly relations existed bc-
tween Darby and me when I volunteered
to paint his owner’s gable. Climbing the
ladder after lunch I found the bird sitting
on the top rung. The surprise of his first
attack nearly ended my career; the
systematic manner in which he routed me
rung by rung finished the job—as far as
painting that gable was concerned. But I'll
never forget “Tiddles” ; neither will I
forgive him. For years he always selected
my chairback when I stayed for a meal;
I alone was allowed to be his partner for
his “kiss cocky” act. Then his master
went on a fortnight’s holiday, leaving
“Tiddles” in my care. The second day,
for no possible reason, the bird literally
bit the hand that fed him. Angered, I
flicked him with a towel. “Tiddles” put
his head down and deliberately waddled
into the attack like a rum-happy sailor.
Nothing but serious injury would have
“These queues are all the same —nothing

stopped him; so I called it off. But
“Tiddles” hasn’t! The incident occurred
15 years ago, yet that bird still refuses to
see that there is room for both of us in
any portion of the house.

“Notaden”: It must be nearly 60 years
since I first heard the yam of the nest-
robbing stockman and his self-amputated
arm (B. 10/7/’46). ’Orrid details were
much as “H.H.” gives them: locality, the
Gulf country; narrator, an old N.Q.
cattleman. In a dozen or so of later
repetitions it has always occurred in
Queensland, the furthest south being the
Darling Downs. Period has varied from
“the early days” to “only a few years
ago.” On one occasion the stockman
was a newchum visitor, and on another
a city-bred jackeroo named Harry Allan,
the only one of the lot who seems to
have had a name. Latest version of the
sad tale that I’d come across was, curi-
ously enough, as recently as four days be-
fore “H.H.” revived it. In the “N.Q.
Register” “Bill Bowyang” related his
experience of having met in 1914 a bar-
maid in a Parramatta (N.S.W.) pub who
claimed that the victim was her brother,
and in support produced a photo, of a
young man. When the beer comes on
again a pub-crawl round Parramatta
might help “H.H.” in his historical re-
searches, even after 32 years. Barmaids
are a very long-lived class,
* * * *
“Bughouse”: Practically up till the be-
ginning of the Victorian era, lead held an
important place in industry, it being the
one metal that could be readily and
cheaply moulded into pipes. Steam and
the Iron Age, of course, displaced it.
Now the Atomic Age looks likely to
put it well to the top again, since it
affords just about the only defence against
' the deadly “Gamma” ray. So the
future may see battleships plated heavily
with lead instead of the present steel
armor. All-lead houses, too, may come,
and possibly sheet-lead garments. Thus
prosperity may again arrive at places long
abandoned. For instance, the first
mineral mines in Westralia were of l ea< L
at Northampton, well to the north of
Geraldton. For a century that mining
field has suffered many vicissitudes, often
being closed down for years Booming
at present owing to world shortage of
that dull, ductile, easily-melted metal, it
is likely to keep on booming.
* * * *
“Chuck”: It was a warm, bright morn-
ing, and from his post under the nag
Paddy’s dog turned his muzzle wistfully
towards the open slopes. His nose
twitched as he spotted a brace of bunnies
in the gully, and his ears came up eagerly
, when half a dozen jumbucks grazed into
sight. Then his eyes once more sought
the pub door. The hours dragged by. At
midday Paddy’s familiar figure appeared
and made for the dining-room. Half an
hour later it returned. The dog rose to
growl a warning at an overfed setter
approaching the ancient moke, then sub-
sided again. At five o’clock Paddy re-
appeared, picked up a parcel from the
butcher’s, and came for his horse. The
dog was delighted. Racing
ahead as they neared home, he
drove the stray sheep back
through the hole in the fence,
coursed three hares from the
lucerne, and missed a rabbit so
narrowly he somersaulted over
the log where bunny disappeared.
Followed a lively session with
a pig that had fixed gardening
ideas ; then he fetched the cows,
chased the fowls from the chaff-
bin, and returned as his boss
unrolled his parcel. “Gripes,
you can’t be hungry, surely,”
snapped Paddy, as he tossed the
dog a scrap; “doin’ nothin’ all
day! Y’ orta be like me, and
earn y’r tucker,”
* * *
“Goldie”: Darley and a
couple of mates worked a gold
show about five miles from our
camp, and they used a brace
of packhorses for taking in
rations, chaff and mine supplies.
Cases of gelignite went packed
in chaff, and we often speculated
on how the old mare carrying
1001 b. of the explosive would
fare if she tripped and rolled on
one of the rocky inclines they
travelled. The track crossed a
bridge near our gunyah and
Darley, an obliging fellow, al-
ways made- a special point of
bringing our rations. Then one
day the horses went bush and
Darley had to make the trip on
foot. He pulled up at the bridge,
wriggled out from under a pack
that would have broken another
man’s back and brought our
rations over. “Aw, thanks,
Joe said, “But we didn’t expect
y’ t’ bring our stuff. Y’ve got
more’n enough t’ carry as it is.
Darley dismissed his protesta-
tions with a gesture. “I’d sooner
bring y’r rations,” he told us earnestly.
“Bit of a struggle gittin’ here, o’ course,
but I’m bound t’ feel the benefit when 1
git goin’ with a lighter load.”

“Horseless Horseman”: There’s no
doubt about the agility and playfulness of
a seal. One sundown recently from the
amphitheatre of the cliffs overlooking the
entrance to Mallacoota (Vic.) I watched,
silhouetted against the sandy bottom, a
massive bulky specimen dart after fish
seemingly as fast as any porpoise. Not
once did it miss, and on one occasion it
came flat-out up on the sand after a
three-foot Yank flathead it had chased
ashore. Then by holding the flathead’s
tail in its mouth, the amphibian began
slapping the fish from side to side on the
sands, next throwing it in the air and
catching it. Although there is a large seal
rookery 30 miles away at the Skerries
Rocks off the uninhabited and little-visited
Wingan Inlet, one of these marine
mammals in the waters at ’Coota is,
according to fishermen there, a rarity.
The only other seal in memory turned up
four years ago and one fisherman won’t
forget it either. On a dark night he was
hauling the wing of a seine net, when a
loud, terrifying bark beside him was the
first intimation of the visitor’s presence.
* * * *
“Smoky Ridge”: Dan and Bill,
bachelor brothers, having decided to re-
plenish the empty corned-beef cask,
sallied forth with rifles to “drop” the
choice steer already yarded. As a resuit
of shocking marksmanship and a white-
anted stockyard the startled beast broke
loose and regained the herd. The
brothers began stalking and taking
wild pot shots, and in the end
the steer became bogged in a dam
which was no more than a small
yellow pool in an area of rank mud. This
time Dan couldn’t miss. Then the
brothers waded in, skinned and cut up the
carcass where it lay. As each piece was
hacked off it was thrown on to the bank.
After being swilled with a few kerosene-
tins of yellow water the meat was put on
meat blocks in the skillion. Later a
neighbor, hearing frequent shots, became
alarmed and, on approach, after tendering
a cautious “Anyone at ’ome?” found Bill
seated in a corner of the skillion with a
rifle across his knees. Diplomatic inquiry
elicited the fact that Bill was “Keepm’
ants and things orfer the beef,” and to
the query “What was the shootin’?” re-
plied “So far I think I got eight blowflies
and a butcher bird!”
TO A CHILD
Small scrap of human flotsam quietly sleeping,
Wrack of the sullen seas that surge and roar
Brass-throated through the arches of eternity
In the dark caverns of creation’s core,
What fret of wind and flowing tide has brought
you
Out of the maelstrom to this earthly shore?
So, in the raw red sunrise of earth’s morning,
The first of voyagers was brought to land,
Wet with the salt dews of the long night’s labor,
And cast up breathing on the curving strand;
And Time, that old beachcomber, wakened early
And found him pillowed on the glistening
sand.
Still the bright peace of that forgotten dawning
Glows on your forehead with an inward light
As in some sun-flicked pool of clearest amber;
Where, at the brim, a quiet watcher might
Gaze down on golden shaft of placid pebbles
' And in that stiff translucence drown his sight.
There in those glowing deeps through brown
weeds traihng
New-minted motes of mellow sunlight seep
Down where long chains of water-snails hang
dreaming
And drowsy worms and water-beetles creep
To beds of moss where fairy fins are waving
And little minnow thoughts lie fast asleep.

THE MAN ON THE LAND
“DON'T WORRY. I'M SENDING IT TO
GRAZCOS.”
Diet and Wool Production.
“Outback”; An experiment by the
C.S.I.R. demonstrated that whep adult
strong-wool sheep had their protein
ration increased from about 30 grams
to 240 grams per day their wool weights
increased by 250 p.c. This was one of
the highlights of a paper by G. R. Moule,
Queensland Department of Agriculture
and Stock, at a conference of the Aus-
tralian Veterinary Association. On
Mitchell grass pastures in s.-w. Queens-
land, where pasture production is domi-
nated by summer rainfall, continuous
grazing at the rate of one sheep to five
acres proved the best grazing treatment.
On Mitchell grass pastures in n.-w.
Queensland, where prolonged droughts
with heavy losses of stock were frequently
experienced, in good seasons production
was far greater than could be utilised by
the sheep under normal stocking.
Growth was active from January to
April, and thereafter practically ceased;
a rapid deterioration in the nutritive value
of the herbage occurred from April to
September. Phosphorus and protein
were adequate for nutrition in April, but
very low in September ; calcium was low
throughout. —A striking feature was the
rapid increase in yield during February
and March; peak production occurred
about three months, after the first rains.
Variation in the amount of wool produced
by altering the diet of sheep was accom-
panied by a marked alteration in staple
length and fibre diameter. Potentially
strong-woolled sheep produced wool of
dimensional characteristics corresponding
to 64-66’s spinning counts on poor diets ;
by improving the protein supply the dia-
meter became greater, and at the maxi-
mum level of production wool with a
spinning count of 56’s was observed.
In typical fine-wool sheep the change
was less marked, but the mean fibre dia-
meter was found to vary with the pro-
tein supply, though neither a high pro-
duction rate per unit area of skin nor
the production of a strong wool was
achieved. In an experiment by the
C.S.I.R. with New England fine-wool
lambs and South Australian strong-wool
lambs,rihere came a time when the New
England sheep were unable to make
further increases in body weight, but the
S.A. sheep continued to show steady
gains until there was a wide difference in
the average weight of the two groups,
although fed at the same nutritional levels.
On the restricted diet both strains made
about the same growth. The fleece
weights cut by these sheep showed a
marked difference in favor of the S.A.
sheep when compared with the New
Englanders within their own nutritional
groups.
Pigs.
“Plane Creek”: Beginners in pig-rais-
ing often make the mistake of erecting
the buildings on unsuitable ground.
Without proper drainage there cannot be
real health in a herd of pigs. Soggy,
black or clayey soils are no good at ail;
forget about pig-breeding if you are un-
able to site your pig-pens on dry land.
The light soils which absorb the moisture
quickly and dry up speedily after rain
are the best.
Give the pens such an aspect that they
will receive plenty of sunlight. Concrete
makes durable pens, but board flooring
is much warmer in winter. Farrowing
sows and litters should certainly be
housed in wooden-floored houses. Cor-
rugated-iron shelters are well known to
be freezers in Winter and furnaces in
summer, and should not be used except
perhaps in emergency.
It is not sufficient to feed and house
pigs well; keep their quarters clean.
“Me horse is down with the 'flu. S'pose it'll be me next!"
Dirty creature though the pig is, it does
not thrive as well in dirty as in clean
quarters. And, in due course, in piggeries
where pigs live in dirt and squalor, it is
found that something is always the matter
with some pig or other. That is the be-
ginning of the end.
Culling Poultry.
“Myrrhee”: If production is lower
than seasonal expectations over a period
of weeks, start culling. Pick out birds
showing a shrivelling of the comb, dull-
ness of eye or coarseness. If the pelvic
bones are closed and the abdomen con-
tracted it’s odds on that the bird isn’t
laying, but allowance, particularly in the
heavy breeds, should be made for birds
recently returned to the pen after broodi-
ness. If there is a doubt about such
birds, put them into a separate pen and
check over in a week’s time.
Hens showing coarseness should be
eliminated after the flush laying season.
Main characteristics of a fowl showing
coarseness are: Skull wide across the
top and deep above the eyes, with over-
hanging brows ; eyes sunken and small;
comb large and coarse in texture; face
wrinkled and feathery.
Super, on Wheat.
“Mr.”: Dr. H. C. Forster, in the Vic.
“Journal of Agriculture,” quotes some
arresting figures in a reply to recent
criticism of artificial fertilisers by sup-
porters of the organic manure “school.”
In manurial tests on wheat at the State
Farm at Werribee over the past 33 years,
the super. Icwt./ac. plot averaged 10
bushels more than the “no manure” plot;
super. 2cwt/ac. gave 13 bushels more and
farmyard manure (10 tons/ac.) an in-
crease of bushels or, compared with
the super Icwt./ac. plot, \\ bushels less
per acre after all the trouble and expense
of putting on 199 more hundredweights
of manure. Dr. Forster concludes:
“When the cost of applying farmyard
manure and the difficulty of obtaining
the requisite amount to apply to a normal
wheatfarm are borne in mind, and com-
pared with the relatively simple and cheap
method of applying super, with the seed
as practised at present, no sane individual
could do other than advocate the use of
chemical manures in preference to farm-
yard manure.”
Future of Citrus.
“Oralem”: Commonwealth and States
have agreed to plant 7300 acres with
citrus under soldier settlement. An addi-
tional 4500 acres planting is also planned
apart from Government schemes. These
represent a 25 p.c. increase on present
plantings. An official estimate of Aus-
tralia’s population increase by 1956 is
also 25 p.c., and the proposed citrus
plantings would come into bearing about
that time.
The American trend with citrus culture
now is to drop sowing of tick beans
and other legumes, except varieties of
white clover, similar to Dwalganup.
These do not compete with the tree for
available soil nutrients at a vital stage
of the growth of the crop. Another new
practice is to bum weeds with oil.
The practice is to keep citrus groves
in a fine state of cultivation, partly to
keep weed growth at a minimum and
partly to conserve moisture. However,
research indicates that undisturbed, un-
cultivated soil retains moisture better.
The old theory of capillarity appears to
be on the way out. Another new develop-
ment in citrus culture is the spray method
of irrigation in place of the present
widely-used furrow method. The advan-
tage of sprinkler irrigation is the even
distribution of water, only wetting the
soil down to the depth of the root zone.
The furrow irrigation, apart from being
wasteful, tends to create a water table.
Unfortunately few of the present irriga-
tion systems are planned solely for citrus
and the sprinkler system is not easy of
adoption. However, for citrus growers
with their own pumping plants it is quite
practicable.
Galvanised Burr.
“Atlanta”; The first good season after
ringbarking brings its share of pests.
Galvanised, “blue” or “while” burr soon
takes possession of lighter country. On
areas heavily stocked, grasses and herb-
age are rapidly choked out, with deterio-
ration in land values and monetary re-
turns. Many owners argue that the burr
is one of their best standbys in drought.
Observation will prove that the pest’s
quick response after rain enables it to
choke other feed, in which case it is
nibbled by hungry stock. In a dry spell
it’s the first to die and the dry, brittle
thorns are a menace to man and dog,
apart from detriment to wool.
Spread of the pest is alarming. Re-
cently I noticed a few burrs on rich
creek flats in the Hunter River district,
but they won’t long be isolated. To date
the C.S.I.R. has produced no effective
counter. Some form of parasite like
cactoblastis seems our only hope. For the
present, reasonably light stocking with
a run of good seasons will give grass and
herbage a chance of re-establishment.
Grasses for Places.
“Pat Ater”; There is something in the
claim of dairymen on the N.S.W. South
Coast that it’s better to keep to grasses
for pastures which prove themselves than
to “try them all.” Those who have tried
Phalaris tiiberosa away from the rich soil
of the tablelands know that its worth as
winter pasture and spring silage depends
on soil and moisture. On the sandy out-
crops of the slopes of Cambewarra it
has never been a great success, yet the
climate there seems favorable. W. Boxail,
whose well-covered paddocks are on the
northern side of Cambewarra, finds that
Kikuyu is not only a grand summer grass
but lasts well into the winter. It grows
luxuriantly in good weather and it takes
a bad dry spell to stop it.
Another point in favor of Kikuyu, on
which the A.I.S. thrive, is that it keeps
the bracken back, and even carries the
fight into bracken-infested country to
wipe out large areas. Cocksfoot is a good
grass on the drier slopes, where moisture
drains quickly, and it keeps green when
the ryes and clovers are browning off.
C. W, Graham, at Gerringong, has peren-
nial rye on the flats, with some sub.
clover, also Wimmera rye in winter to
give him a good carrying feed. Most of
them have oats for winter—a grand graz-
ing crop.
White clover has established itself well
in this district and red clover is sown as
a balance to the übiquitous
It needs renewing at intervals. C. T.

London wool
sales to start again
in September
NEW COMMITTEE FORMED
Auction sales of wool will be resumed in the London market in September, and will
continue at regular intervals as before the war. Six firms of London Selling Wool Brokers have
formed the Committee of London Wool Brokers to handle wool consigned to the London
market for sale.
Although the constituent firms have pooled their resources for the most efficient conduct
of wool sales, yet each firm will preserve its separate identity and will continue to maintain its
individual relationship with its clients.
The organisation will be run by an executive committee drawn from the constituent firms,
and will be staffed almost entirely by employees of these firms.
The opening series of sales can hardly include any new clip wool, but the London Brokers
look forward to the early re-appearance in their catalogues of wool consigned to this market
for sale. All Shippers will continue to receive the individual attention of Brokers as they have
done in the past.

Hindmarsh, of Gerringong, has the classic
stands of Phalaris. for both grazing and
cutting for hay or silage, which seems to
have proved its worth in coastal districts.
So long as good soil and autumn moisture
are there Phalaris can be relied upon.
But it’s better up on the tablelands with
these conditions. To cover the steeper
slopes where moisture is not assured, the
tall fescues can be relied upon, with
cocksfoot, to do a good job.
Erosion Checks.
“Gip”: Those living in sandy areas—
either on the coast or inland —would do
well to follow the example of Albert
Morris at Broken Hill in choosing trees,
both for shade and soil-binding pur-
poses, that thrive in sandy soil. Too often
one sees trees planted around homesteads
that are not suited to local soil condi-
tions, and are useless in combating
erosion.
One of the best trees is the athel (Tam-
arix articulatd), which is noted for its
hardiness under extremely dry conditions.
It does not grow to a large size, but
throws a moderate shade and is invaluable
as a check to erosion. Landholders who
have creeks with sandy banks that are
gradually falling away would do well to
plant a few athels along the banks. After
the first month the seedlings will not need
watering. Thousands of these trees are
growing at Broken Hill, often half-buried
in great sand-drifts.
Other trees that do well in sandy soils,
either semi-desert or up to a 30in. rainfall
area, are the Western Australian rostrata
(or redgum) and the American mesquite.
The rostrata must not be confused with
the true redgum, being a different species
altogether. Other invaluable trees are the
red-flowering torquata, the bimble-box
and the acacias.
The Equitation Test.
“Haute Ecole”: The Sydney R.A.S.
has decided to include an equitation test
in next year’s Royal Show schedule,
pleasing news to saddle-horse enthusiasts.
The test, described in B. 13 /3 / ’46, should
be contested by a large field and is an
innovation worth encouraging.
Hints for the Farm.
“Biltjim”: The White Yorkshire pig is
ideal for the overseas market because the
preference is for a heavier pig than is
sold on the local market. For the Aus-
tralian market the weight should be be-
tween 1001 b. and 1301 b. and for overseas
between 1301 b. and 1601 b. A Large
White boar with selected sows will give
the best baconer. The advantage of the
Large White over the darker types such
as the Tamworth is that 99 p.c. will be
got by crossing with other breeds. Ex-
cellent results will follow a mating of
Large White sows with Canadian Berk-
shire boars.
“Agric”: H. J. Snider, College of Agri-
culture, University of Illinois (U.S.A.),
says that maize is high in both
protein and mineral. It stores these ele-
ments in different parts of its anatomy.
The grain is deficient in mineral, while
the leaves contain almost as high a per-
centage as lucerne, which should be re-
membered when feeding as silage. On a
dry-weight basis a ton of grain averages
1901 b. protein to 2 lib. mineral, while a
ton of leaves contains 921 b. protein to
611 b. mineral; cobs have 561 b. protein
to 141 b. mineral; husks have 541 b. pro-
tein to 361 b. mineral, and the stalks
carry the highest ratio of mineral 501 b.
protein to 511 b. mineral.
“Herbert”: Ducks are hardy and adapt
themselves to circumstances anywhere.
Give, them plenty of chopped-up meat in
their food ration. See that they get an
abundance of chopped green fodder
cabbage leaves, turnip tops or green
lucerne, and in 12 weeks after hatching
they will be ready for killing. Keep
plenty of dry, clean straw in the shelter
where ducks roost; they lay at night or
early in the morning.
“Herbert”: If fowls are fed on grain
put a packet of Epsom salts in the drink-
ing water every fortnight. Change the
water after two days. Epsom salts is a
purgative which leaves no after-effects. A
teaspoon of sulphur added to the mash
twice a week helps fowls during the
moulting season; it also hastens egg-lay-
ing and should be included in pullets
diet twice a week.
“Ned”; Plant a few chilli bushes in the
fowl run, embedding a bottomless kero-
sene tin around the plants to prevent the
hens from scratching away the soil. These
hardy bushes will provide heavy crops.
Cut up firm, ripe chillies and include
them in the morning food mash. They
are a splendid tonic. The fowls will eat
the dried chillies as they drop off the
bushes. A teaspoon of powdered ginger
in the mash now and then is another good
idea,
“S.H.K.”: Yards used for dipping
should never be used for any other pur-
pose, as the dip that drips off the sheep
mixes with the dust (B. 26/6/’46). This
is blown on the roofs of buildings near by
and the water therefrom contains poison,
which causes bad effects to stomach and
kidneys. The dust also causes severe
headaches, affects the nose and throat,
and sometimes causes dry scab on the
limbs.
“Nedher”: A safe way to water young
chickens is to cut a kerosene tin, length-
wise, to make a pan lyin. deep. In the
bottom place a good issue of clean road-
metal screenings. The chicks can then
walk about in the water without danger
of drowning.


Re - establishment
-a task that concerns all Australians
Re-establishment is a big word and re-establishment is a big task that remains for
every Australian to do. It concerns YOU. Your help is wanted to assist in every
possible way those thousands of men and women who contributed most directly
to Australia’s War effort. Their needs are vitally important. The following
statements emphasise how urgently your help is required.
• To those citizens who seek a unifying field of service in this
cause, voluntary Repatriation Local Committees offer wide
scope. These exist in rural and suburban areas and are rapidly
being increased in number to cover the whole Commonwealth.
Reaching beyond the legislative provisions of repatriation, they
are active in all phases of re-establishment, and their repre-
sentative community character, combined
with a fine tradition of service, must
commend them to all public-spirited
Australians.
J. B. CHXFLEY,
Prime Minister.
O You can contribute to the diggers’ continued rehabilitation
by doing everything in your power to fulfil the nation’s pledge
made when our sailors, soldiers, and airmen offered all they
had for something they believed to be not only worth fighting
for, but if needs be, worth dying for. Particularly you can
help a sympathetic understanding of the diggers’ problem. The
man in the street should be on the side of the service man
and woman. They are worth it; they deserve it, and it will
help them to adjust themselves
to civil life.
ERIC MILLHOUSE, K.C.,
Federcd President,
R.S.S. & A.I.LA.
• During the war over 730,000 men and women served in the
Australian Military Forces. We now have the task of fitting
back into civil life these men and women. Some are still very
young and others are now old, but all must be fitted back and
given employment. This is but their right, I appeal to every
individual to do everything possible to discharge his or her debt
to the servicemen and women of Australia by ensuring to them
reasonable and lasting security.

© No support can be given to the belief, which exists in some
quarters, that time spent in war service has little economic

• I am confident that the men who flew as air-crew, together
with the men and women who serviced the aeroplanes, main-
tained the stores and assisted in the clerical administration
of the Air Force, will give the utmost satisfaction in any sphere

buttons and patches, the growing
rumors of the visits to a disreputable
family named Twine. Mr. Hart decided
to pay an unannounced call on Mr.
Ham.
And in due course Mr. Hart did go
out to the Grey Box on his exploratory
tour.
There were sounds to reach his ears
long before he reached the schoolhouse.
Strange sounds, not to be diagnosed as
Recess, for Mr. Hart looked at his watch
to verify the time. There were laughing
and wailing and shouting and yelling and
singing that children never make or do
when authority is near, even in their
play.
Closer view showed children —mostly
girls at every window —on the out-
side, and struggling for a view within ;
several boys on the roof and a small
crowd yelling encouragement to them;
certain enterprising youths trying to get
a butt out of the nanny goat with a
millet broom ; another group hanging a
“bushranger”on an acacia-tree. On the
verandah a fairly big girl—Nancy Stib-
bert, it turned out eventually—was wring-
ing out a handkerchief or small towel.
Mr. Hart walked up from the road-
after commandeering a boy to hold his
horse —with his most official tread. The
children recognised him even before his
sulky stopped.
Word went round quickly. “Here’s
Mr. Hart! ” It acted like an extinguisher
on a candle. Everyone put on looks of
concerned innocence and succeeded in
guilt writ large.
“Where,” said Mr. Hart, looking round
accusingly, “where is Mr. Ham?”
Only Nancy Stibbert had presence of
mind. “He’s inside, Mr. Hart. And he’s
very ill.”
“III!” repeated Mr. Hart. “111, did
you say?” __
Nancy nodded very nicely and
seriously.
“What is the matter?”
“I don’t know, Mr. Hart. He fainted
about half an hour ago—and we’re trying
to bring him round.”
Mr. Hart went in, followed by Nancy.
The faces disappeared from the window
and retired to a distance where what was
doing inside might still be seen without
undue recognition of those looking.
MR. HAM was lying on his back on
the middle of the floor. He was
quite unconscious, though the announce-
ment of Mr. Hart’s arrival had sent a
violent shiver through him. But only a
temporary shiver —he relapsed to com-
plete immobility again.
A grey blanket had been improvised as
a pillow for his head. Gracie Nott was in
charge. She was dabbing Mr. Ham’s
forehead with a damp rag. Gracie was
a very self-possessed young miss, and
was not overawed by the presence of Mr.
Hart. She kept on with her ministrations.
“Vic,” said she to another hefty dam-
sel, “a few drops of vinegar on this rag.
And you, Laura, have the brandy ready
as soon as he opens his eyes.”
Mr. Hart felt inadequate, which he
seldom did in his high official capacity.
He looked at the recumbent Ham, and
to his unmedical eye Mr. Ham didn’t
look bad. He seemed unconscious, how-
ever.
“What happened?” Mr. Hart almost
deferred to the managerial Gracie.
“Fainted!” she replied as to a by-
stander of no consequence. “Ah! His
eyes are flickering—have the brandy
ready! ”
“Do you give brandy for a faint?”
asked Mr. Hart uncertainly and tenta-
tively.
“Always! ”
“Always!” repeated Mr. Hart in some
wonder.
“Well, it always brings Mr, Ham
round. Vic, like a good girl, you had
better get a new collar for Mr. Ham.
There are the two I ironed yesterday
on the dressing-table in his bedroom.”
Then, looking at his shirt, opened as far
as it would go, Gracie added regretfully
“He’ll have to keep this shirt on —there
isn’t a clean one to give him.”
Mr. Hart felt more hopeless. But he
thought to assert himself that he’d better
do something. With some distaste he
took Mr. Ham’s wrist to feel his pulse.
He was not sure what he could do about
the pulse when he had felt it.
“No need to,” said Gracie, “I felt
it just now. Low—very low. It only dis-
turbs him to feel it.”
Mr. Hart put the wrist down.
Mr. Ham opened his eyes, slowly
flickering, and closed them again.
“He’s coming to, thank goodness!”
said Gracie. The others breathed relief.
“Give him air,” said Gracie, and waved
the others back, including Mr. Hart.
“Ith that Mithter Hart I thee?” and
Mr. Ham raised his head a little.
“Don’t you worry, Thithle. You’ll be
all right.” Gracie’s tones were almost
motherly.
“Thank you, Grathie. I’m better
now.”
Mr. Ham waved the brandy aside, per-
haps in deference to Mr. Hart. Gracie
gave orders for the disposal of the brandy
and other items used in fetching Mr.
Ham round. The blanket and brandy
went back to the bedroom, the vinegar
and basin to the kitchen and the washers,
towels, rags and handkerchiefs to the
clothes-line.
Word got round the now subdued
groups that Mr. Ham was better. But
Mr. Hart at last decided to act. He had
the school lined up, and addressed the
small gathering. He had decided, he
said, in view of Mr. Ham’s indisposition,
to send them home for the rest of the
day.
Gracie and Vic didn’t want to go.
“Are you sure, Thithle, you are all
right?”
“Thank you, Grathie, right ath rain.”
Gracie and Vic left reluctantly.
“Queer turn that wath, Mithter Hart.”
Mr. Hart thought it and many attend-
ant circumstances decidedly queer. But
he didn’t say much. He was feeling
official strength and confidence begin-
ning to surge through him. “I came out.”
he said in the level official voice, “to
inspect the school.”
Mr. Ham’s eyes lit up with even
greater surprise than usual. “To inthpect
the thchool?”
“But I find that impossible—it will
have to wait. Are you often indisposed
—like that?”
“Indithpothed?”
“Please don’t repeat. I said ‘indis-
posed.’ Do you often faint?”
“Yeth, Mithter Hart. Often. I get
quite dithy.”
“Dithy!”
“Yeth —dithy.”
Mr. Hart pondered over that, and a
few other things—prominent among them
was “Thithle.” But he was a diplomat,
too —of a very heavy kind.
“Perhaps, Mr. Ham, it’s the climate
that doesn’t agree with you.” The official
eye was coldly glancing round the room.
It was in fine disarray, and on the smaller
blackboard was a primitive sort of sketch
with “That’s Thithle” attached.
But Mr. Ham didn’t think the climate
made any difference. And he liked the
Grey Box, he said.
Mr. Hart left it at that. He didn’t
probe, for he was afraid of what he
might find. But his mind was made up,
and he wondered and wondered how far
the faints were genuine.
IN less than a week the department
I moved Mr. Ham to a far corner of the
State. It removed at the same time a
bright spot in the lives of the Grey Box
children. And Gracie and Vic were wild
about it, and blamed each other for
something, and didn’t speak to each other
for a long time.
In its wisdom the department sent
along a maiden lady of an age no man
could calculate, who seemed all made
up of vinegar and chastity. She set that
school in order. There was no nonsense
about Miss there never had
been. She was born a teacher, and sire
would die a teacher. And in the Grea
Beyond she would be a teacher for at
eternity. „ , .
It was the end of the Ham regime, and
only the pleasant memory was left.
Mr. Bisley and Mr. Hopper were
pleased; they rejoiced in fact in then
hearts that they had “shifted Ham an
the dangers of him. There were no
dangers* potential or otherwise, m
Gorm. Even Venus would have been a
different and a broken character entirely
after a week or two of Miss Gorm.

Rough Stuff.
“Four members of the French police force
are trying to catch a poltergeist m a village
near Lille.”— “Daily Telegraph.’''
It was when my great-grandfather
Hugo married for the second time that
the peace of our home was shattered by a
poltergeist.
The haunting began in the kitchen,
when the rolling-pin arose voluntarily
and gave my step-great-grandmother
Jemima a black eye. The pound of Steak
which promptly attached itself to the in-
jured optic didn’t improve matters. Hugo
remarked philosophically that that would
be Martha. She had, he added, a jealous
disposition, and had always promised to
haunt him if he married again.
Martha soon became a dutiful though
inconvenient presence at meals. A casual
request to pass the jam would be eagerly
fulfilled by our poltergeist, resulting in a
sharp increase in the number of baths
taken in the household. Owing to Martha s
habit of indiscriminate face-slapping,
most of us took to wearing fencing masks,
while Hugo bought an old suit of armor
and tried to ignore the whole business.
Jemima didn’t take it lying down. She
and Martha would have a pitched battle
with the family breakables most evenings,
while the rest of us went to the pictures
or watched from the side-lines, according
to taste. Jemima usually came off second-
best, owing to some difficulty about
sighting the target. .
She won in the end, though. When she
put up emerald and magenta curtains in
all the rooms, Martha left in disgust. The
last we heard of her, she was doing well
as a waitress in a city cafe.

looked up as the Acting Assistant Col-
lator of Inutile Information strode into
the room.
“Wake up, Athol,” the newcomer said
briskly, as he waved a sheaf of papers.
“I want to run over these with you and
see what you think of them.”
The A.A.C. of LI. was regarded as one
of the D.0.1’.s most promising bureau-
crats. Already he had in full measure
that splendid contempt for the public
which is the hallmark of the successful
bureaucrat. He had further shown his
quality by acquiring, within six months
of starting a new branch with one junior
typist, a staff of 124, including a chief
clerk on £9OO p.a., an assistant chief
clerk on £650, a personal secretary and a
personal messenger.
And it was the A.A.C. of LI. who had
been responsible for the production of the
brilliant brochure on current Australian
life which had just been sent to New
York and London to assist intending
migrants. The telling photo, on the front
page showing a horsetram going up
Sydney’s King-street, with bustled, hour-
glass-figured women in four-foot hats and
mutton-chop-whiskered men in tight
trousers, coupled with such accurate in-
formation as being able to buy a half-

invented carbide lamp being available for
suburban house lighting, had earned him

his success, too, had naturally flowed
from the fact that he had never been out
of Melbourne.
“What is it you’ve got there?” asked
the D.D. of T.S., partly shaking off his
lethargy with a tremendous effort,
“A questionnaire for kindergarteners,’
replied the other. “I’m doing this off my
own bat, of course. Nobody seems to
have thought of it before, and, anyway,
the answers should give us a vital angle
on the thoughts of another cross-section
of the nation. I’ve kicked off with this
one —I think it’s quite good:
“Do you make a point of swallowing
your all-day sucker or striped humbug
before poking your tongue out at the
teacher ?
“That ought to rock ’em, Athol, eh?”
The D.D. of T.S. nodded approval.
“Nice work, George, but wouldn’t it be
a good thing to add this?
“Also describe your reactions to such
inhibitions upon your movements as the
teacher may subsequently impose for the
delinquency.’’
“Excellent, Athol. I’ll make it a
double-barrelled question. Now the next
one:
“Say why it should be a good thing for
Australia, were the Government to give
free passage and a grant of land and
money on arrival to 200,000 Left-wing
Zionist immigrants from Poland and
Hungary.”
“A sound question that, George. And
a bit of publicity might strengthen the
Government’s hand on that subject.”
“And this one’ll make ’em sit up and
chew their crayons:
“What would you like to be when you
grow up [Girls]: motor mechanic, black-
smith, window - cleaner, psychologist,
meter reader, oxy-welder ? [Boys]: Dress-
designer, hair-waver, butcher’s cashier,

grapher’s model ?”
“Capital, George. After all,
boys don’t want to be engine-
drivers or hangmen any more,
and what girl wants to be a
movie star or a famous
novelist?”
“Just what I say, old boy.
Now here’s another:
“Do you consider the
Soviet’s determination to pur-
sue unilateral action in Mittel
Europa compatible with its
obligations under the Potsdam
Agreement ? If so, what effect
will this have on U.N.O. de-
liberations in view of Dr.
Evatt’s brave fight as champion
of the Smaller Nations ?”
“That’s the stuff, George. It
will help inculcate a lively in-
terest among the young fry in
international politics.”
“And here’s another, Athol:
“Before you go to bisey you
no doubt listen to the wireless.
What sends you to sleep
quicker : a serial like ‘The Case

Parliamentary Broadcasts ?”
The D.D. of T.S. looked alarmed. “Mr.

being a reflection on Parliament’s ability
to entertain listeners.”
The A.A.C. of 1.1. stared at his con-

THE OTHER FELLOW'S MIND

Yank and Aussie
Nothing emphasises the difference be-
tween the Australian and the American
more than their reactions to films. Shortly
after the war ended I saw “Bataan” at an
Aussie infantry camp at Torokina.
In one scene the hero threw a grenade
at a score or more of Japs and extermi-
nated the lot. The audience en-
joyed this more than the antics of Laurel
and Hardy in the preceding film. When
he threw another grenade into a solidly-
constructed building and the whole struc-
ture disappeared in a monster explosion,
I thought the fellows would have
hysterics. Later on, a youthful Filipino
died from Jap savagery after an intermin-
able deathbed oration in which the most
frequently used words were “fiecdom,”
“democracy” and “Uncle Sam.” The
reaction of the audience was a mixture of
beiedom and irrigation.
Eventually the hero, urging his men to
further effort, tells them that “the Yank
has taken Buna, Lae and Salamaua and is
pushing the Jap out of New Guinea.”
As the unit belonged to one of the
brigades which took Salamaua and finished
up in the Finisterres, I feared that they
might tear the screen to pieces ; but the
funny side of it struck them and a great
gale of laughter blew over.
Shortly afterwards, I saw the same film
at a Yankee “Seebee” camp. The dough-
boys received the atomic grenades with
enthusiasm, and while the youthful
Filipino said his deathbed piece you
could have heard a pin drop. When he
eventually expired and was wrapped in
“Old Glory” there was a spontaneous
burst of applause. One honest fellow near
me had to use his handkerchief violently
for some time after this scene.
Perhaps the Australian is over-cynical.
Or is the American over-emotional? —
Don 5 (Q.).
Commissioned Air-crew
Some air-crew officers (B. 10/7/’46)
were immature and unable to bear the
responsibility of commission rank, but
the state of affairs was by no means
general and certainly not limited to air-
crew. The fault lay largely in the selec-
tion.
Air-crew did 10 months’ training as
rankers under the rigid discipline imposed
by such as “C.G.L” The majority of
these non-flying officers did a short
course in an administration school and
then emerged to pound the air-crew
trainee. Hence the term “five-week
wonder.”
Air-crew abroad found that after post-
ing to an operational squadron the
“sprog” crew was regarded as a junior
crew, irrespective of rank, until it was
operationally experienced. Included were
officers of the rank of flight-lieutenant
and above who had come from Training
Command as flying instructors with many
hours of flying in their log books. Rank
went into the discard in ops., and “C.G.L”
should know that many crews had
n.c.os. as skippers over commissioned
members.
“C.G.L” may have been a very capable
officer, but air-crew have painful mem-
ories of some escort officers. For in-
stance, the escojt officer who, in a transit
camp in the U.S.A., rostered his air-crew
sergeants for latrine and kitchen duties
under the eyes of American privates—
their expressions had to to be
believed. Trouble was averted only by
air-crew p.os. being able to reason the
aggrieved sergeants out of rash action
until matters were healed. —456 Squadron
(Q-).
An Empire Air Force
In 1939 the R.A.A.F. was in a particu-
larly sorry state. We did not have one
modem aeroplane of any type. Our
plants had only just been established and
were already committed to building a few
already obsolete types such as the Wirra-
way and Beaufort.
It seems now that history is to repeat
itself and the defence of this vulnerable
country is to be pushed into the back-
ground. Our greatest prqjplem in air
defence is to find the money each year to
pay for the quantity and quality neces-
sary.
The cheapest and most thorough solu-
tion is to amalgamate the R.A.A.F. with
the R.A.F. in an Empire Air Force.
Our Australian squadrons and airmen
were highly successful with the R.A.F.,
and the Empire Air Training Scheme
proved what could be achieved by pooling
training resources and men. Already in
the future R.A.F. there are to be an
Empire Armament School and an Empire
Central Flying School. Why not take the
proposal to its natural conclusion and
combine all the Air Forces within the
British Commonwealth?
The many advantages to be gained out-
weigh any opposition. For the payment
of an annual sum, an Imperial Air Staff
could provide a certain number and type
of units for Australian defence. This
would eliminate the need for - any large
administrative headquarters like St. Kilda-
road, Melbourne. Aircraft building pro-
grammes could be concurrent with those
in England, and the industry itself could
be dispersed throughout the least vulner-
able parts of the Empire. Australia can-
not afford to be three years behind the
aircraft building programme of the R.A.F.
Officers and men of such a combined
Air Force would be enlisted from those
countries which contributed to it. They
would have unrivalled chances for study
abroad and, in time, would inevitably
develop an Empire outlook.
And not the least advantage of the plan
would be the removal of the R.A.A.F.
from the present public service and Minis-
terial control. — Sagittarius (Vic.) v
Soldier-Settlement in Tasmania
A friend of mine returned from the
war with deferred pay and other savings
amounting to £lOOO. Here in the Speck,
farmland which was selling at £2O an
acre before the war is now bringing up
to twice that amount. My friend bought
100 acres, some of it second-class land,
at £3O an acre. He borrowed £lOOO under
the provisions of Commonwealth legisla-
tion, and another £lOOO from a relative.
This with his own £lOOO barely paid for
the farm.
When he moved in he found that he
needed another £l5O to furnish the four-
roomed cottage. He had to buy 10 cows,
which cost him £2O each. Then he
needed a separator, plough, draught-horse
and dray, harrows, and the tools and
implements necessary on any farm. He
had to borrow again, and, at a conserva-
tive estimate, he starts off with an annual
interest load, including sinking fund pay-
ments, of about £l5O. He will need good
seasons and high prices to meet such a
debt after providing for his wife and
himself. Experienced farmers on better
land say that their properties would not
stand such a strain.
Is history in soldier-settlement going
to repeat itself? Are soldier-settlers to
leave their farms, broken in health and
spirit, only to see them sold to civilians
at less than half of the values origi-
nally placed on them? That’s what
happened last time. — Demos (Tas.).
Army Training
“Peter Mike” might include better-
informed training in his army reforms.
Mainland training for M.T. men
stressed the importance of black-out driv-
ing, and convoys without lights, endan-
gering civilian life and property, were
nightly affairs. Dispatch riders were
taught such hare-brained stunts as two-
way riding without lights on a blacked-
out road. A.A.S.C. trucks delivered
rations at constantly changing meeting-
places “secretly” at night. We were
shown how to camouflage our tents and
vehicles, how to disperse during an air-
raid, and how to dig underground dumps
in which to store our petrol. We were
taught to keep our dim oil lamps shaded
so that light would not show through
the tent canvas. Then we went to New
Guinea.
There, we found that night-driving was
done with headlights full on, that Don
Rs drove jeeps. Camps were ablaze with
electric light. Rations were delivered in
daylight and stores towered skywards in
great dumps without any attempt at
camouflage. Tents stood out white
against the tropic green. As for camou-
flaging our vehicles, even war-’planes
were parked in the open on the air strips.
If we had dispersed during air raids as
we had been taught, those 1942 days
would have been almost one long period
of dispersal. Regarding underground
petrol dumps, it wasn’t possible to dig
one big enough to hold the thousands of
gallons of aviation fuel which lay in the
numerous clearings, so it hardly seemed
worth while burying our 50 gallons of
truck fuel.
So much for methods modelled on
those of 1918. In this field at least, our
mainland training was a waste of time
and public money.— Bondi Beachcomber
(N.S.W.).
The Sikh
It is refreshing to learn that my “en-
thusiastic and uncritical” efforts have
caused “Shere Khan” (B. 17/7/’46) to
promote Sikhs as fighters from mere
“good bullocking” (B. 29 / 5 / ’46) to “grand”
when properly led. With a bit more read-
ing in Indian history he will come across
the name of one Runjeet Singh, once
classed by the Duke of Wellington as the
most able military leader of his day in
all Asia. He will also learn how, some
nine years after Runjeet Singh’s death,
Shere Singh was de facto victor over
Lord Gough at Chillianwallah, inflicting
losses of nearly 2500 officers and men
and capturing three regimental colors.
The 14th Dragoons there gained their
disliked nickname of “Fours About,” and
narrowly escaped destruction by a body
of Sikh horse until rallied by the heroic
charge of Captain Unett. Gough himself
admitted that, had he been unable to
withdraw at nightfall, he would have
suffered a disastrous defeat.
The Sikh forces of 1848-49 were over
80 per cent, true Sikh. They received no
“thrashing,” as “S.K.” seems to imagine,
but accepted terms of honorable sur-
render, and proved invaluable allies in the
subsequent Indian Mutiny, engineered by
Moslems and Hindus.
Reproaches concerning the absence
from Sikh history of great poets and
social reformers are mathematically un-
sound when subjected to the law of aver-
ages. Six millions of people, with a hard-
working, hardfighting history extending
back for four centuries at most, cannot
be expected to compare in such matters
with 90 millions of Moslems going back
for seven centuries in India, and double
the number of Hindus with 30 centuries
behind them. The argument is about as
reasonable as would be one reproaching
one of Melbourne’s outer boomday
suburbs for having failed to produce a
Norman Lindsay, a Mackennal and a
Florey.
As for their “little claim to Sikhistan,”
“S.K.’s” acquaintance with present-day
Indian affairs seems about as shaky as his
knowledge of past ones. Barely a month
ago the Sikhs were welcomed into the
All India Congress on a formal undertak-
ing that their claim to Sikhistan. and its
internal self-government would be
honored in full. And, as Hindu and
Moslem know, they are the kind of people
who will see that those promises are kept.
—PUYYAKA (Q.).
Wool Profits and Charges
B.A.W.R.A, distributed profits as they
accrued. The “policy” now is to wait
till the whole scheme is completed before
deciding what to do with the profits. By
leaving it till afterwards difficulty will be
experienced in tracing beneficiaries of
hundreds of growers who have died, and
other hundreds who will die, in the 17
years between 1939, when the first clip
went into the purchase plan, and 1956,
when the Prime Minister anticipates that
J.O. will be wound up.
The Central Wool Committee handed
over £7,000,000 in profits. Australia’s
share from profits on sales of wool by
the U.K. Government to foreign coun-
tries, amounting to £10,000,000, has been
invested in the new wool plan. The Aus-
tralian Government owes the industry
£657,701 to make up the loss on wool
sold to manufacturers at less than the
British flat rate. The Government had
promised to reimburse these deficits, but
“ I mended this yur leaky valve. Wont be long now foor steams up.
Mr. Chifley now says the industry itself
can provide the funds out of the admini-
strative charge.
If Government promises amount to
anything, growers should receive half the
profits on the sale of 2,060,000,000 pounds
of Australian-grown wool in the stock-
pile as at June 30, 1945. Mostly inferior
sorts, so no high prices can be expected,
but a conservative estimate of 2d. per
pound would yield £8,583,333 over and
above the ten-million profits already in-
vested, making a grand total of
£26,241,034 in profits.
The 2s. per bale tax is being replaced
by a 5 per cent, contribution charge on
the gross sales of future clips. This will
range from 12s. on a £l2 bale to 30s.
on a £3O bale. The extraction is to cover
the industry’s share in the costs of operat-
ing the new scheme, to recoup the Govern-
ment for interest on amounts expended in
purchasing wool under the plan and to
provide the equivalent of 2s. per bale for
the Wool Use Promotion Fund. Growers
say the charge is exorbitant. Under the
old scheme three farthings a pound more
than covered all operating and administra-
tive expenses, including the building of
huge wool stores. Will there be another
accumulation of profits for the Govern-
ment to play with?
The current demand for wool suggests
that the war-time and post-war plans
might yield £30,000,000 in profits.
Violently fluctuating wool returns have
been a bugbear to growers and have
greatly influenced national industry as a
whole. With the foregoing amount in a
Wool Stabilisation Fund, under grower
trusteeship, the industry would be able
to ride over another depression and
hardly feel the bump.— Graz (N.S.W.).
Milne Bay
Both “Merlin” and “A.J.M.” (B.
10/7/’46) are right about the capital of
New Guinea. What is needed, however,
is not merely a place to house Govern-
ment officers, but a site that will fit into
the future of our island territories.
Amalgamation of all our tropical terri-
tories and the Solomons is inevitable, and
the selection of a centre of trade, industry
and government must be made with that
vision in mind.
Milne Bay is at the doorway to the
islands and central to all, and if selected
and developed with vision should become
as important to the Empire as Singapore,
Port Said, Darwin, Gibraltar and others.
Manus is important; so also are Madang,
Tulagi, Rabaul, Lae and Moresby; but
all are on the outside rim, with China
Strait and Samarai as a focal point. Milne
Bay is on our own land, not subject to
U.N.O. or Colonial Office dictation.
We had an opportunity once to select
the best site for the capital of a whole
continent, and the memory of the vigor-
ous fight put up by The Bulletin re-
mains with us older readers. Don’t let
us miss the opportunity to select the best
site for a great tropical city! There are
at and near Milne Bay a coastal strand,
healthful plateaux, wonderful mountains
and abundant water power to provide
electric energy for a maritime, industrial
and governmental city.—C. C. D. (S.A.).
Radio Writers and Producers
“W. K. D.” (B. 24/7/’46) dubs as “pub-
licity” and “blatant self-advertising” the
pathetic meed of credit awarded to such
people as radio writers and producers.
The immediate reaction of the average
listener to a good play or feature
is that the star. Miss Soandso, was “so
witty and clever, and wasn’t that abso-
lutely wonderful, that telling speech at
the end?” This is pleasant for the
actress, who achieves a reputation, pub-
licity, more work and more money.
It is neither pleasant nor so profitable for
the writer, who supplied her with the
script, and the producer, who dotted each
“i” and crossed each “t” for her at re-
hearsal, They are left in the background,
and, contrary to popular opinion, they do
not receive large weekly pay envelopes
to compensate them for their anonymity.
Often a single member of the cast, no
matter how few his lines, receives as
much for speaking them as the author re-
ceives for writing the whole script.
If “W.K.D.” must rob us of the little
dry bones flung to us at the end of the
show, he might as well carry his crusade
to its logical conclusion with Mr.
Edward Browne plays a First Piano Con-
certo in B Flat, with an Orchestra, or
“Miss Heloise Jones sings ‘I Know inai
My Redeemer Liveth,’ from an oratorio
entitled ‘Messiah’ ” ; or “Mr. Inigo Smith
appears in two plays ‘Hamlet an
‘Pygmalion.’ ” — Max Green (N.S.W.).


Trade-Unions
My quarrel with Australian trade-
unionism is that parochialism and selfish-
ness are its ruling characteristics. Rarely,
if ever, does an Australian trade-union
seek to inspire its members with pride in
their calling, and the determination to
give the consumer a square deal. Craft
guilds, medieval predecessors of the
modem trade-union, held those things to
be all-important.
In Britain the guild tradition has per-
sisted with many elder craftsmen. Harold
Massingham, in his Men of Earth, re-
cords that one George Goodchild, of
Naphill, last of the chairmakers of the
Chippendale school, was offered large
sums to make fake Chippendale furniture,
his work being hardly distinguishable in
style and quality from original pieces of
the master. He indignantly refused and
also refused to take any more than what
he considered a fair price for his work.
Such conduct would be regarded as
crack-brained in an Australian trade-
union world. But a standard of integrity
like Goodchild’s is something to envy.
Trade-unionism that was capable of in-
spiring it could genuinely claim a privi-
leged position in the community.—D. A.
(N.S.W.).
Rice
The Australian consumer has not had
a smell of rice during the war and the
Wakool Commonwealth-State 4000-acre
farm has averaged a production of over
600 P tons of the stuff. yAs there is no
indication yet that rice is to be released
for sale, why is this high-producing farm
to be abandoned?
We are told that every ton of rice is
needed to feed the hungry millions whose
staple food i,t is, so it seems incredible
that the Commonwealth should stop the
production of 6000 tons. Australian
housewives should have something to say.
—WILYDAH (N.S.W.).
Country Industry
If we want decentralisation of industry
we shall have to pay for it. Industrialists
will not go bush at the risk of their profit
margins unless they receive subsidies,
chiefly in the form of freight concessions.
The economic place for a factory is
near its raw materials, markets and
labor—all of which (in N. S. Wales) are
concentrated in the Newcastle-Sydney-
Wollongong area. It does not make sense,
from the commercial view, to haul heavy
raw materials up the country, and then
back again in the finished state.
Even those industries which use perish-
able raw materials, such as fruit and
vegetables, find that the advantage of be-
ing situated near the source of supply is
offset by cost of bringing machinery,
coal, sugar, salt, case-timber, cans and
bottles from the coast; and of sending
the manufactured goods back to the
coast.
As for labor, don’t be misled by reports
that the tobacco and clothing trades are
opening annexes in country towns be-
cause female labor is unprocurable in the
cities. Certainly the average country
town can support one smallish enterprise,
but if you seek to operate on a big scale
the bottom of the labor reserve is soon
touched. It’s useless to think of import-
ing fresh labor because few towns have
houses for newcomers.
Then there is the problem of seasonal
labor. A country town may have no
difficulty in providing a steady 30 or 40
hands all the year round, but what hap-
pens at the annual peak, such as the peach
or tomato seasons at a cannery? For
five or six weeks a couple of hundred
men and girls are required, and they just
aren’t there. To bring them in entails
the establishment and maintenance of a
hostel which will be empty most of the
year—an expenditure smaller concerns
cannot face.
Decentralisation of industry will come,
but by a process of slow growth. It is
no use invading the Chamber of Manu-
factures and shouting “Go west, my
son!” in the expectation of a rush re-
sponse.—Hist (N.S.W.).
University Degrees
As I run my eye down the “Situations
Vacant” column of the paper I’m struck
by the fact that most Government jobs
are open only to those sporting a univer-
sity degree, while private employers set
far more store on practical experience.
The most outstanding example of this
sort of thing I ever saw occurred in Wes-
tralia in 1942, On the staff of Army
Education Service in Perth was a man
who compiled the daily newsheets sent
by sigs. to every Army unit in Western
Command. He did a good job, and
attempts were made to obtain promotion for
him and a post more worthy of his ability.
I invited—and got —a snub when I
told a visiting Brasshat that we would
lose the services of this man, a private,
“Who is this Gavin Casey, anyway?”
he demanded. “Do you think because he
won the S. H. Prior Memorial Prize we
should put him in charge of all A.A-E.S.
publications? We have men who have
taken honors in literature and economics
to do that work for us.” I shut up.
Manpower eventually took Casey out
of the Army and made him State Censor
at £6OO a year, and Army Education
Service publications continued to be
written by theorists with university de-
grees. Today Gavin Casey is Common-
wealth Public Relations Officer in U.S.A.
Casey has no “degrees” save those
earned in the school of experience.
One of our big industrial undertakings
employs a number of men holding uni-
versity degrees —but sees that they get
acquainted with the arts of driving trucks
and of operating brooms, picks, shovels
and wheelbarrows. “Knocks the nonsense
out of them, and makes them realise that
an ounce of practice is worth a ton of
theory,” the manager informed me. An
eminent medical officer told me that the
greatest examination - passers on earth
were some Indian students. “But after
they’ve qualified they’re not as fit to
practise as herbalists,” he added.
Government departments are being
created at a staggering rate, and to get
a job with them all you need, judging by
the advertisements, is some sort of de-
gree. But all that those departments
seem able to do is to plan to further
orders without producing anything prac-
tical.
I’m all for education myself, but it
seems to me that universities turn out far
too many people who think that talk is
a substitute for work.—Ess Ecks (S.A.).
Immigrants
The immigrants we want are firstly
those of British stock, then Americans —
if they can be induced to leave their own
country. If there are insufficient of these
people we could make up the deficit with
people of Nordic origin; Norwegians,
Swedes, Scandinavians are all splendid
types of immigrants. They would soon
adjust themselves to our national environ-
ment and merge into the community as
fellow-Australians in direct contrast with
Italians or Jews, who tend to form their
own communities.
We must ensure, too, that there is a
place for the immigrants in our economic
framework. They cannot be allowed to
enter industry at the expense of our own
workmen. Certainly, an increased popu-
lation means increased spending power,
with consequent increased production,
which in turn, calls for more employ-
ment, but, unless each entrant to Aus-
tralia has a certain amount of capital
this spending is only a redivision
of Australia’s resources. Guildford
(N.S.W.).
Save the Forests
“Unless we make up our minds that we
are going to stop forest fires, then we
can forget the forests of Victoria! ” These
were the words of Herbert Gepp at
the forest inquiry in Melbourne.
The increasing devastation of forest
fires means the extinction of our most
beautiful and commercially valuable trees.
In the Cumberland Valley beyond Marys-
ville nearly all the magnificent mountain
ash, our tallest and one of our most valu-
able timber trees, has been wiped out
already. During the last 20 years the
forest areas have been reduced by half.
Timber is a crop of 50- or 100-years’
cycle, and disastrous fires in our mountain
country are destroying the forest floor,
upon which depends the regular growth
and nourishment of successive crops of
trees.
During the last 60 years the natural
conditions under which our forests grew
have been destroyed, and unless steps are
taken to restore conditions required for
regular rotation of timber, the forests will
continue to deteriorate.
Measures needed are prohibition of
burning off in grazing country near forest
areas, fencing of forest lands to pre-
vent animals grazing on them, and a com-
prehensive system of observation posts,
’plane patrols, and firefighting services.
—T. C. A.(A.C.T).
Leagues and Legions
The position regarding ex-servicemen’s
organisations in S.A. is approaching the
farcical stage. The three organisations
claiming largest memberships—Air-Force
Association, Legion of Ex-Servicemen
and Women, and the R.S.L. —seem to be
eternally at loggerheads. Whether each
body is seeking to boost its membership
by kudos-hunting is a moot point, but the
tact remains that there is a complete lack
of unity.
Some weeks ago the Legion claimed
to have brought about an inquiry into the
possibilities of using surplus Army camps
for community housing centres. The
A.F.A. retaliated by taking credit
for having instigated the sending of
a new invitation to the Churchills to
visit this country. Meanwhile the R.S.L.
had turned down the best suggestion
of the lot—that of forming a joint com-
mittee of delegates from all service bodies
to further welfare work— Shavia (S.A.).
Town and Country
I exchanged the bustle of the city (B.
17/7/ ’46) for the quietness of a country
town a few years ago, and I wouldn’t
change my place of living now for worlds,
The quietness of a small town is some-
thing that grows on you, and life is
infinitely less humdrum than in the largest
of cities. At first I chafed at the lack
of npise and rush and at every oppor-
tunity I hied back to the citv, but each
“Skip that bit about seem me in a large house—I've just done three
months in one.”
visit became more irksome—until 1
realised just how dull a large city could
be.
The city contained about 500,000 souls
who hadn’t the slightest interest in one
another, whose only means of amusement
were stuffy picture theatres and sweaty
dance halls, who were constantly bad-
tempered and ill-mannered to each other,
and who were out for all they could get.
The streets were filthy and jammed with
deadly-serious people whose only interests
appeared to be hibernating in ugly build-
ings during the day, and rushing home at
night to change and rush back again
into the noisy bedlam for an evening’s
“relaxation.”
I knew, from experience, that these city
dwellers lived in a pattern that seldom
changed from one year’s end to another.
Out of bed at the same time every morn-
ing to a frantic shower and a rushed
breakfast, a scamper for the same old
tram or train, the usual stifling routine at
the office, a race for home again at the
end of the day. Week after week, year
after year, it went on.
Not for me again, thanks! My little
hamlet is quiet and clean. It’s small,
perhaps, but I know more people here
than I ever knew in the city. There are
two picture theatres I can go to with
three changes of programme a week;
there’s a seaside handy which isn’t littered
with the filth of near-city seaside resorts ;
the country surrounding it is beautiful;
and the good old Australian bush smell
is right at my door.
The people who live in this town of
mine are friendly, courteous and progres-
sive. They know more about the various
phases of Australian life than their
brothers in the city, and have a keener
sense of civic pride because they’ve more
to be proud of. They form their own
progressive societies, patriotic and chari-
table committees with more enthusiasm
than city dwellers.
As for the snobbery referred to by
“1.G.M.,” since when was that foreign
to a city? Where the local bank-manager
is the apex of small-town society, his
city counterpart —the successful black-
marketeer, the opulent s.-p. bookie, or the
publican who bets in thousands —is no
substitute to crow about.
If proof were needed to determine
which community is the happier, a glance
at city and country health and crime
statistics should be sufficient. Happily,
I can walk home on the darkest of nights
without having to glance over my
shoulder in apprehension of thugs. And
for that and a hundred other reasons
I’m staying right where I am —in this
small country town of ten thousand souls.
—Yokel (Q.),
The less things “of importance” that
happen in a country town the better, if
“1.G.M.” means the kind of things hap-
pening in Sydney and other cities —
murders, sensational law cases, divorces,
juvenile delinquency, fabulous dress
shows of imported stuff, curtailment of
electric power, and strikes. Admittedly,
country people do not indulge much in
these cultural amusements, but they have
satisfying social gatherings at dances and
shows for many miles around, at cours-
ing, golf, tennis and football. We even
get a decent picture show occasionally,
As far as snobbery is concerned,
country people appreciate honest worth
much more than city people do. In this
town of 1300, where all know one an-
other, it would not be in one’s own
interests to be condescending to the only
shoemaker or to the milkman, or any
other man in trade or business. So even
the natural snobs tone it down. Here
one’s position counts for less than one’s
usefulness to the community. The war
taught us that, too.
There are two libraries, not very
highbrow, but if one wants books on
any subject or handicraft, the excellent
free service provided by- the Adelaide
Public Library for country people solves
the problem. One pays only to return
the books (about 3d. for the two).
It could hardly be claimed that the
majority of “townies” are cultured. It
is the minority in city and country alike
that interest themselves in the things of
the mind. — Una (S.A.).
Architectural monstrosities in country
towns? Melbourne is generally regarded
as a fine city, yet architectural horrors
come immediately under notice on emerg-
ing from its two main railway stations or
on approaching it from Port Melbourne
or the Yarra docks.
Country-town snobbery? Look at any
of the Australian capitals and see how
the different classes have sorted them-
selves out into their respective suburbs
and, in those suburbs, into their respec-
tive streets. If, in country towns, the
bank-manager is at the apex of society,
he is usually a worthy soul and as fitted
to occupy his position as his city counter-
part.
Paul McGuire in his Australian Jour-
ney remarked that “the cities, Heaven
knows, have vulgarians enough, but it is
still most true of the country people of
Australia that they are plain, open, un-
affected people with less sense of social
chicanery than any race of men I know.”
—Ceg (Vic.).
Country girls form a big percentage of
those who forsake country towns. The
fact that so many of them go to the cities
in search of The Man must in some
measure affect rural development. These
girls often say that they will never marry
country boys. The precise reasons for
this attitude are obscure, but the fact that
the country lad has often been held up to
ridicule as a slow-witted oaf might have
some bearing on the case.
If more country-bred women remained
in their towns to marry and raise families
the community spirit of the town would
be strengthened and some measure of
material progress would follow. — Blue
(Q-).
Country-town snobbery is conspicuous
enough, even in these democratic days.
One young man resigned a bank clerk-
ship in a N. S. Wales country town to
manage the railway refreshment room.
As a bank clerk he moved in the
town’s highest set, but after taking the
other post he found he had fallen in
“social position” and was no longer in-
vited to functions reserved for the “elite.”
—A. D. (N.S.W.).
