Official War News
"To your Bibles, O ye Britons!” cries
Marr Murray in Bible Prophecies and the
Plain Man (Hodder and Stoughton, per
Sydney Book Club). Excellent advice, judg-
ing by Marr Murray’s own use of his own
prescription. For from his study of the
Bible the author has discovered, among other
marvellous revelations about the present
war, that the prophets of the Old Testament
had actually prophesied Winston Churchill!
As Marr Murray reverently says: "In
times of difficulty, doubt and trouble the
Christian turns instinctively to the Book
for comfort and guidance. And he finds
what he seeks; the Bible never fails.” So
Marr Murray sought for prophecies about
the present war, and he found what he
sought, abundantly. He even found Win-
ston Churchill. “One-third of the Bible
consists of prophecy,” he reminds us, and
ws are told to "search the Scriptures,” not
merely a portion of them. Surely among
those ancient prophets who seemed to have
nothing to do but to dream dreams, and
make a good living out of interpreting them,
one or more ought to have hit upon such a
large-sized thing as this war? Space does
not permit an explanation of the method of
interpretation used by this Scotch descend-
ant of the prophets: much more interesting
are his results.
First, it is obvious that we are living in
the closing years of the Times of the Gen-
tiles. The signs of the times are all around
us.
In the Church of England congregations
have been steadily declining during the past
half-century... .In three years the Baptists
lost 12,000 members.... The Methodists
10,000 members... .The missionary societies
have also found that fewer men are volun-
teering than formerly... .In view of all
these things can there be any doubt that the
world is rapidly preparing itself to welcome
the Antichrist, and, therefore, that the end
of the dispensation is at hand ?
Also, Marr Murray proves by his useful
method of chronology that, according to
Nebuchadnezzar’s vision of the Great Image,
"we are now living in the period repre-
sented by the clay portion of the feet, and
exceedingly near to the toes.” The toes
obviously represent a confederacy of
nations. And, naturally, Germany’s decla-
ration of war is a fulfilment of the second
seal.
Jt
Incidentally, the British are the lost
tribes. Apparently these tribes were mislaid
in a,d. 70, somewhere in the neighborhood of
the River Euphrates, and though no doubt
•very effort has been made to trace them, no
sign of their address or whereabouts has
been discovered. And now we find that the
Lost Tribes have never been lost, not even
mislaid. In fact, they’ve been so much in
the limelight that nobody ever thought of
looking for them there. The lost tribes are
the British. As the British Empire has
been marked out for special favors by God,
it is evident that the British are the missing
portion of the chosen people. Every pro-
phecy about the strayed tribes fits us.
Though there is no absolute evidence in
secular history in support of the theory that
the British are the mislaid or overlooked
Ten Tribes, that matters little to Marr
Murray. He merely points out that the
Goths, or Scythians, or Sakai were the
descendants of the strayed tribes. Henoe
the Saxons must be Sakains: "The similar-
ity between the words Sakai and Saxons is
obvious Originally Isakaisona, the sons
of Isaac, the name of the people gradually
evolved into Saxons.” This is distinctly
cheering. “If the British are the modern
descendants of the ten lost tribes, then King
George most belong to the house of David.”
And Marr Murray supplies us with a con-
venient legendary genealogy. Zedekiab, the
last King of Judah, begat Tea Zephia, a
daughter, who married King Heremon, of
Ireland. And King Heremon of Ireland
was the ancestor of Fergus Moore, King of
Argyll, a.d. 487, from whom was descended
Kenneth Mac Alpine, the first king of Scot-
land in 884; and James I. of England was
a descendant of Mac Alpine. And if that
doesn’t satisfy the Irish and the Scotch,
there is the further conclusive evidence:
"One of the names of the Prince of Wales
is David, and in 1924 it will be exactly
3000 years since David was anointed King
over Israel.”
Of course, it was to be expected that the
United States would turn out to he Manas-
sah.
Manasseh was the thirteenth tribe of
Israel; there were 13 original States in the
American Republic, and these were repre-
sented in the national flag by 13 stripes;
on the seal of the States 13 arrows and 13
stars appear; the dollar contains 13 stars,
and 13 letters form the scroll; on the other
side of the coin the eagle has 13 tail-feathers,
13 wing-feathers, 13 arrow-heads, 13 hori-
zontal lines and 13 perpendicular lines;
finally, there are 13 letters in the national
motto, “E Pluribus Unum.”
Well, that ought to settle it
The Germans, by similar brilliantly-argued
deductions, are proved to be the Assyrians.
“The Assyrians will be a great military
people, cruel aud relentless to those who fall
before their might, and their kings shall be
infidel kings who boast that they are greater
than God Himself. There is only one people
in the world to-day who fulfil these require-
ments to the very letter”: the Germans.
One thing is certain. God knew that this
war was to take place. If the Kaiser had
died last July, if Nietzsche had not lived to
write his works.... if some great storm or
other natural phenomenon had destroyed
the German plans, as they have so often
upset the carefully-laid calculations of
Britain’s enemies, and if a million other
ordinary happenings had taken place, the
war could not have been.
And, according to the prophets, God’s pur-
pose is to punish the Assyrians for boasting
that their military might is greater than His
word, and to punish Israel for deserting
the true religion. And we discover-that the
German Chancellor’s real name is Rabsha-
keh, for Isaiah tells us that Herr von Rab-
shakeh attempted to persuade the Israelites
to give pledges that they would not aid
their allies. The prophets also mention that
the Germans are to be opposed by seven
shepherds and eight principal men. When
Marr Murray wrote his new Bible he could
count only six nations allied against the
Assyrian. The entry of Italy has miracu-
lously proved him right. The eight prin-
cipal men for only seven nations is
explained by the fact that the war will
be partly a naval war, and one of the nations
“will have two principal men, one military
and one naval. This rOle is actually being
played by Britain to-day, and so we may
come to the conclusion .that Mr. Winston
Churchill is the eighth principal man of the
prophecy.” How wonderful it all is!
Also, since Turkey is Eber, her doom is
sealed. “Ships shall come from Chittim
[? Chatham] and shall afflict Asshur and
shall afflict Eber, and he shall perish for
ever.” Good news for our boys at Galli-
poli ! And official.
The prophets also actually foretold the
modern biplane.
“When the living creatures went, the wheels
went by them; and when the living crea-
tures were lifted up from the earth, the
wheels were lifted up.... And under the
firmament were their wings straight, the
one toward the other; every one had two,
which covered on this side, and every one
had two, which covered on that side, their
bodies. And when they went I heard the
noise of their wings, like the noise of great
waters, as the voice of the Almighty, the
voice of speech, as the noise of an host;
when they stood they let down their wings.”
But the prophet made a few mistake#,
pardonable in those pre-aviation days.
“Knowing nothing of aeroplanes, the
prophet assumed that the noise of the xnotor
was due to the wings. Moreover, he did not
realise that the wings are not actually let
down, but only seem to be let down, when a
biplane comes to earth.”
Isaiah also prophesied that Britain would
be afflicted by air-raids, but that they
wouldn’t amount to much. And in the sec-
ond Book of Kings we are told that the war
win last three years. That’s perhaps where
Kitchener got the information. Micah in-
forms us that Germany will be invaded, and
completely overthrown, while “the words of
the prophet are nothing less than a vivid
description of what has happened in Belgium
and Northern France during the war.” Also
the Kaiser is doomed to an ignominious end.
“Then shall the Assyrian fall by the sword,
not of a mighty man; and the eword, not of
a mean man, shall devour, him; but he shall
flee from the sword,” Evidently he is going
to get it in the back.
J*
Passing reluctantly over such an im-
portant discovery as that the great pyramid
was built by Shem, the son of Noah, which
is conclusively proved by Marr Murray, and
various exciting theories of the Millennium,
we come to the absorbing question whether
the Kaiser is the Antichrist. A full bio-
graphy of this individual’s remarkable
career, extracted from the prophets, sug-
gests the pleasing possibility that the Anti-
christ’s first name is Wilhelm; but a closer
examination discloses that he is hardly big
enough to fill the rble of the Beast of Reve-
lation. Yet as Daniel describes the Anti-
christ as the king of fierce countenance, he
must have foreseen the Kaiser’s moustache.
And he actually possesses “the number of
the Beast.”
On January 27, 1914, he was just 660
months old, and six months later the war
broke out. From the date of his birth to
the opening of the great war was within a
few days of 666 months. Moreover, in the
words “Der Kaiser Wilhelm II.” there are
18 letters, or 6+6+6. The first Beast of
Revelation has seven heads, ten horns and
ten crowns, making 27 separate features
combined in one beast. There are exactly
27 kingdoms, etc., in the German Empire.
But, despite these irrefragable proofs, tbe
Kaiser fails by not complying with the
specification that he must be a great mili-
tary genius. “He is merely a man possess-
ing some of the characteristics of the Anti-
christ.” Personally, however, we are con-
vinced that he is Antichrist. We call the
Germans hogs, and isn’t a hog a beast, and
what is to prevent a hog being a Beast of
Revelation?
Since all these official facts can be delved
from the Bible, then this page fervently
echoes Marr Murray’s exhortation: “To
your Bibles, O ye Australians!”
Australian
The fourth volume of the first series of
Historical Records of Australia, published
by the Library Committee of the Common-
wealth Parliament, consists of Governor
King’s despatches to and from England
(1803-June, 1804). Fredk, Watson’s intro-
duction deals with King’s commission from
England, his many controversies with the
military, and his development of the eman-
cipist class possibly as a counterpoise to the
hostile military. He finds two acts of King’s
administration difficult of explanation and
open to an unfavorable interpretation:
King’s claim to a share of the wild cattle,
escaped from Sydney, that made their way
to the cow-pastures of Camden; and the
granting of land by King (then a retiring
governor) Bligh (the governor-elect).
“The granting of land by a retiring governor
to a governor-elect was an extremely doubt-
ful act of administration, but the sequel,
provided that any connection between the
two can be made, was stranger still.” One
of the three land-grants made by Bligh was
to the wife of King, and the 750 acres
granted were given the name, by Bligh, of
“Thanks.” “Without further documentary
evidence, no sinister meaning can be
attached to the mere naming of a land
grant”; but Fredk. Watson suggests that
these actions are tantamount to an inter-
change of land-grants between an out-going
and in-coming governor. Land scandals,
even in those days!
The volume contains 750 pages of docu-
ments, with a commentary and an index.
Since this collection comprises merely
eighteen months of our history, it is evident
that Fredk. Watson has obtained a steady
job.
The Melba Gift Book proved that artistic
book production is possible in Australia;
but the firm of George Robertson (whose
printing, in this case, is done by The
Specialty Press, 189 Little Collins-street,
Melb.), has bettered that publication by its
production of Here is Faery. This collec-
tion of stories and verse by an anonymous
author has been given a chaste and beautiful
setting. The letterpress is admirably placed
on the page, and the volume is superbly
decorated and illustrated by Percy Leason.
His decorations are dainty and altogether
delightful, while the illustrations in color,
brilliantly reproduced, have an immediate
artistic and imaginative appeal. Percy
Leason’s painting of the swan-maiden shows
qualities of strength and movement some-
what unexpected in so poetical a design.
Such is the casket, made of Australian
materials by loving Australian hands, that
nobly enshrines... .what? Nothing. Here
is fatuity! The anonymous author has
written a couple of futile little plays, a few
“precious” and pretentious fairy stories,
and some meaningless little verses. Except
for a few felicities of empty phrase, there is
no sign throughout of inspiration, emotion,
individuality or thought. The verse, though
feeble, is at least well-behaved. It echoes
real verse rather prettily; it gently tinkles
in a ladylike way.
All the old-world lullabies,
Flowers and sleepy seas,
Fluttering lids of failing eyes,
These, and things like these;
Woolly clouds that die, that die
On mountains faint and far,
And water-dreams that stir and sigh
In the floating ray of a star;
Fainting smiles on baby lips
Murmuring, still, apart;
Lullaby sheep and lullaby ships
Moving on misty plains and seas—
These, and many things like these,
Are piled up in my heart.
Such verse may pass, so charmingly assisted
in its appeal by Percy Leason. But the author’s
prose is pallid, pretentious and trite. The
impression left upon the reader who wanders
through these undramatic and un-poetical
playlets and these trivial allegories is that
the author feels that she has something tre-
mendous to say, but hasn’t the ability to say
it. There is no originality, no emotion, no
creative surge in any of these vague efforts.
And the author has no saving sense of humor
or self-criticism that would save her from
a frequent bathos. The plays are abso-
lutely innocuous, quite undramatic and with-
out the embarrassment of the intrusion of a
single unhackneyed or dramatic idea. But
as the author says: “Still, it does not really
matter, nothing matters, so long as the spirit
in which one approaches this play is sincere
and earnest.” It is just sincerity and ear-
nestness that she lacks.
Nothing matters. Here is Faery would
have been worth but a few lines of polite
dismissal if it had not come hither so glori-
ously casketed. The anonymous author
must blame her illustrator and her publishers
for having thus unwittingly focussed atten-
tion upon so worthless a piece of imitation
jewellery.
Ida Lee (Mrs. Charles Bruce Marriott),
author of The Coming of the British to Aus-
tralia and Commodore Sir John Hayes, lifts
one more forgotten leaf in the history of
this continent by the publication of The
Logbooks of the Lady Nelson (Grafton,
London). The Lady Nelson was essentially
an Australian discovery ship; and her log-
books testify to a remarkable record of dis-
coveries and historic missions. Ida Lee
notes that her publication of the log-books
was immediately necessary, for the handwrit-
ing was in portions so faded as to be just
decipherable; and “apparently only the
story ef Grant’s voyages and the extracts
from Murray’s log (her subsequent captain),
published in The Early History of Victoria,
had ever before seen the light/’ The publi-
cation of Murray’s charts, too, is valuable,
as in the fourth volume of The Historical
Recobds of N.S.W. it is stated that they
are “unfortunately missing.” These charts
the editor discovered at the Admiralty.
The record of the “Lady Nelson” is &
proud one. She was the first ship to sail
parallel to the entire southern coastline of
Australia, and so the first ship to pass
through Bass Strait; her boats discovered
the harbor on which now stands Melbourne;
in company with Flinders in the Investi-
gator she examined the coasts of Queens-
land ; she took the first colonists to Tas-
mania, landing them at Hobart, then called
Risdon; she founded Port Dalrymple; she
conveyed a celebrated Maori chief from Syd-
ney to M.L.; and proved herself an indis-
pensable craft for many other services re-
quired of her. And her end has the right
flavor of romance —not for her crew, but for
us. She was captured by pirates off the
island of Baba in 1825 —and the rest is
silence. From Port Cockburn she set forth
on her last voyage to bring back a cargo of
buffaloes from Coepang and the islands to
the northwards, for buffalo beef was neces-
sary for the provisioning of the vessels that
frequented these waters. As she left, her
commander was warned to avoid Baba, one
of the Serwatti Islands, as it was infested
with pirates. The vessel did not return. The
schooner Stedcombe was despatched in search
of her. She also never returned; and later
it was learned that she, too, had been cap-
tured by pirates, off Timor Laut, 60 miles
from Baba. One survivor of the Stedcombe,
after many years’ captivity with the natives,
was rescued, and ended his life, a broken
man, at Williamstown, Vic.
The Lady Nelson was a ship of only 60
tons. She was one of the first ships fitted
with a centreboard keel. It was due to her
three sliding centreboards, enabling her
draught to be lessened in shallow waters to
six feet, that she was chosen for her hazard-
ous task of exploration. Her first com-
mander was Lieut. James Grant, but she
sailed afterwards under many captains. The
mere navigation to Australia of such a small
craft was a desperate adventure. But
Grant, though a poor chart-maker, was a
fine seaman. He resigned his command
owing to “mortifications and disappoint-
ments” in Sydney, and, returning to Eng-
land, subsequently gained the rank of com-
mander in the navy, with a pension for gal-
lantry in a spirited naval action. His suc-
cessor, John Murray, discovered Port
Phillip: in fact, he “discovered” Victoria,
thus considerably ante-dating the Sydney
morning press, which hasn’t discovered Vic-
toria yet.
Ida Lee makes an ideal editor for this
important contribution to our history. The
matter is presented clearly, and the narra-
tive is interesting and exact. A notable
contribution to our island story, enshrined
in a worthy form. The volume is fully
illustrated with reproductions of the original
charts, and drawings by John Murray.
Henry James James asks us to quote the
review, in The Freeman's Journal, of his
(hush !) Double-bed Dialogues. It runs thus :
“Received.... Dialogues, by Henry James,
with illustrations by Norman Lindsay.
N.S.W. Bookstall Co., Sydney, 1915.”
“B.”: The death of Fitzwilliam Went-
worth necessarily recalls the career of the
“Australian patriot,” and so many different
versions may be given of the important events
in the latter’s life that lovers of Australian
political literature must regret that the one-
time promised biography of W. C. Went-
worth never reached book publication. Mem-
bers of his family were always willing to
place documents and printed matter at the
disposal of writers, and the late G. B.
Barton compiled what might be called a
“biography,” but the publishing houses of
England thought the production too local and
those in Australia too general. Still a man
only half the size of W.O.W. operating in
England would have had his biography. Bar-
ton had to trade his work about in news-
paper sections. A similar fatality attaches
to the life of Parkes. More than half a
dozen biographies of the dead Premier exist
somewhere or other in Australia, as well as
a couple in England, but no publisher will
touch them except on a basis of expenses
guaranteed: and the late Chief Justice
Alfred Stephen also left behind a career and
MSS. suitable for biographical purposes, but
the idea is now dead. The old man and his
daughters worked on the project for years,
but the labor has been wasted.

-MISS ADDINGTON
Modern Miracles
The beautiful daughter of—
Mrs. R. A. Addington, Argent St.,
Broken Hill, is declared to have
been cured of St. Vitus* Dance by
CLEMENTS TONIC.
RECENTLY in France a peasant woman whose little girl had
been bedridden with paralysis for years, had occasion to
visit a churchyard which contained the statue of a well-
known saint. Some of the mould from the tomb adhered to her
handkerchief, which, upon touching her child, cured her. This
fact is vouched for upon reliable authority.
Miracles are not all confined to the older countries, for we have
heard also of similar remarkable incidents in newer countries,
and vei'y often in Australia. A few years ago a certain section
of Broken Hill was electrified by the recovery from apparently
incurable St. Vitus’ Dance of the daughter of Mrs. R. A. Adding-
ton, of Argent Street. It was on the 10th October, 1911, when
first the mysterious cure was reported. The mother, being seen
by a special interviewer, and, overcome by gratitude that her
daughter was healthy again, told the facts at once. She said
that the disorder occurred through her daughter falling from a
tram. This gave her a great shock, and so affected her nervous
system that eventually St. Vitus’ Dance ensued. She became so
bad that it was impossible to hold a knife and fork, and going out
of the house was out of the question. This remarkable condition
continued for some time, medical skill being useless, Mrs.
Addington declared, WHEN SUDDENLY, AS THE RESULT OF
USING CLEMENTS TONIC, a wonderful change took place. She
gradually improved, and soon regained her normal condition.
Nearly two years have elapsed since her complete recovery, and
all that time she has enjoyed the best of health. “I have great
faith in Clements Tonic, and always recommend it, added the
mother, “and you can make what use you wish of this.”
ALL STORES
AND CHEMISTS SELL IT EVERYWHERE.
See vou set the Original Medicine. Do not accept any “just as good’
remedy. There is only one real Clements Tonic.

Ways of Old.
We talked of the past last night.
Two friends who were mates of old,
And the wind came up from the sea.
And the wind was bitter cold,
Bight back to the hours we’strayed.
When Youth on his shining throne
Was king of a pleasant land.
And lord of a golden zone.
Our slioon were fashioned of air.
And .Toy was our pilgrim-staff :
And whatever the Fates might send,.
We took with a careless laugh.
We wandered the world —we two—
Wherever our minds might list;
And the cares of the days-to-be
Were hid in a rainbow mist.
Then magic .was all around.
And wonder on every hand ;
And over the harbor meant
A trip to Fairyland.
Then came a later year.
When suddenly the noise
Of men at work we heard :
But still we roamed as boys.
We did not heed the. call
That he who prospers hears;
Some ’wildering music seemed
To hold and charm our ears.
And, like the golden land,
Wherein we two were born.
We dreamt, and dreamt, and dreamt,
Nor feared a wakening morn.
Like her we walked the realm
Of leisure and of joy ;
No weird Cassandra wailed
Along the streets of Troy.
’Twas fine—ah me!—’twas fine
That sweet dream-way of old,
With all its birds and flowers,
Gold noons and moons of gold.
And yet we woke at last,
And nigh us stood grim Care;
White-lipped, keen-eyeo, she said:
“Behold your board is bare!”
“If that which ye have dreamt
Be wine and bread and meat,
If dreams be ample fare,
Draw in your chairs and eat.”
N.S.W.
RODERIC QUINN.
The Farewell.
You have taken my love in the pink of your
hand,
O eyes that are moist to the drift o’ the rain,
And I wail, little girl, on the knee of the
land,
Till you carry my love to me home again.
You have taken my kiss on the dusk of your
hair,
O ivory temples where Love doth stay;
And a hundred kisses are shrintkl there!
Will you carry them back to my lips some
day?
O dear little heart, I have learned to love!
You have borne it away over leagues of sen.
The heart I have felt like a fluttering dove;
And I wait till you carry it back to me!
And over the water and into the night,
O eyes that are moist to the chill sea-mist.
Your tiny white handkerchief passed from
sight-
Or was if the dove on the curve of yOm
wrist?
M AORI LA M).
BOYCE BOWDEN
Marriage.
Long years ago we walked these paths
That seemed as ways of paradise,
Love’s music lilting in the air,
A sweet, warm passion in your eyes.
And still a tenderness remains
Of all those dear, love-laden hours;
But only as the perfume stays—-
A memory of faded flowers.
Yet still could I your lover he
(I love you now. with added cause;
I think in faith you still love, me)
But for the irk of common laws.
The hard demand, as of a right,
For duty given by the heart;
Grim marriage, binding us with bonds,
In spirit forces us apart.
Hero in the Eden of our youth
We walk awhile, and wish to gain
Its past delights—which still in truth
Are ours —and yet we walk in pain.
For.that grim shadow of our bonds
Lies over us, and checks our hearts,
And. ere the lovers’ pulse responds,
The glamor of romance departs.
It is no fault of yours or mine;
We love as well as laws allow :
Long years ago we walked these paths
As lovers —we are married now!
N.S.W.
HAMER.
The Primal Error.
I cannot judge you, dear! You are a slave,
And I, like any dreaming, doting fool.
Into your hands the sovereign power gave.
You are a slave —therefore you cannot
rule.
I dare not judge myself. I am a king.
Cursing my bondage through each bitter
day,
And wond’ring what relief old Time can
bring.
I am a king—therefore I can’t obey.

Helpful
Advice to
Nursing Mothers
MANY mothers would like to feed their
own children, but are denied the privilege
of doing so, because they have not suffi-
cient nourishment for them. The “Allenburys”
scientific system of Infant Feeding has provided
for all this. When a mother is partly able to
feed her baby she may give The “Allenburys" Milk
Food No. I for alternate feeds, so alike are the
natural and prepared food in this instance, and this
food should be continued until the weaning process
has been entirely completed. The mother herself
must be well nourished and to this end may partake
freely of the "Allenburys" DIET a partially pre-
digested milk and wheaten food, which like the
Milk Food No. 1, is instantly made ready for use
by simply adding boiling water only. After
childbirth the "Allenburys” DIET is surprisingly
helpful in maintaining the strength and producing
a good flow of rich milk.

THE PATRIOTIC CAR AND THE
UNPATRIOTIC TILE.
To ensure victory the efficient organisation
of the nation’s resources and activities is
essential. Of course it sounds like a plati-
tude—and it is one. How to get com-
munal efficiency is what society in Australia
and everywhere else has been striving for
since Government became the subject of
experiment. When the Chinese built their
wall against the Tartars they were organis-
ing things. When Moses produced his
tablets his mind was moving in the same
direction; and so was John Bull’s when
he knocked off trying to run Australia by
correspondence from Downing-street. The
efficient organisation of communities for the
protection of individual and national rights
is, in broad terms, the goal of civilisation,
and it is no use people speaking as if the
Hun’s demented performances had suddenly
revealed to the world a new obligation, in-'
ganisation is obviously necessary in war, but
it is more necessary in peace, since it is in
peace- that wars are lost or won. A nation
which in normal conditions is sloppy in
thought and conduct and too lazy to face
the realities of life naturally finds itself
floundering when calleu upon for the supreme
test of arms. Shouts of “Awake!” and
“Arise!” then become ironic reminders of
past ineptitude. Moreover, a nation cannot
expect to have a formula of efficiency up
its sleeve for use when the enemy is at the
gates ; it is ridiculous to expect that Admin-
istrations and people that didn’t know the
first meaning of organisation and efficiency
will promptly become fired with a new emo-
tion and understanding. Hastily devised
schemes of regimentation imposed upon a
foundation of muddle never will be anything
but jerry-built imitations of the real thing.
They are always wasteful to the last degree,
and the nation which has to depend upon
them will always have to make a heavy sacri-
fice of life and cash.
* * * *
Amongst the very earnest people who are
talking a great deal now about “economy
and efficiency” the most ordinary argument is
that the community can best assist in the
struggle by (1) readily submitting to any
reasonable weight of taxation; and (2) by
cutting out all luxury, such as alcohol and
tobacco, on which expenditure is excessively
high. According to the reliable Knibb.s,
Australians contributed to the public funds
through liquor taxes during the year 1913-
14 the trifle of £4.023,971. and on tobacco
£2,642,697, these two items forming more
than half the revenue received through the
Customs Department, and nearly a third of
the total revenue of the Commonwealth.
Now. putting aside altogether the question
whether people ought to drink or smoke, sup-
pose we look at this matter solely as an
economic problem. How much better able
would Australia be to finance the war (and,
of course, to subsequently meet the condi-
tions of peace) if the public knocked oft
liquor and abandoned the pipe V To begin
with, that six millions would at once be
dredged out of the public’s pocket by taxa-
tion in other forms; and whether the State
takes a sovereign out of a citizen’s right-
hand pocket, or extracts the coin from the
hole into which he dives his left hand, is a
matter of no economic importance whatever.
Nor is the nation going to have more income,
or the population any additional cash, if the
State, instead of getting the sovereign from one
citizen, takes five shillings less from him and
five shillings more from his neighbor. The
things that matter in the economic sense are
(1) where the public gets its cash, and (2)
where the cash goes when the public spends
it. If these two vital points are lost sight
of. talk about national' organisation and
economy and waste on luxuries becomes mere
claptrap. .V people might forsake beer and
pianolas and punting on the racecourse and
yet be a disorganised, wasteful rabble.
* * * *
Too many .Australians are confusing pri-
vate with national luxury. They are trying
to give the word “luxury” the same meaning
in the region of private morals as in the
domain of national economy. Yet beer is
no more a luxury than coffee; smoking
tobacco no more, luxurious than smoking
tea leaves. There is; in the national sense,
nothing essentially luxurious about riding in
a motor-car. It. is when the desire for these
and other things is-satisfied at a cost which
leaves the national 'gashbox poorer that they
become luxuries. When Australians drag a
shipload of beer from the other end of the
earth they are going that much to the bad.
just as they do when they send for quanti-
ties of hats and socks and pants. The end
of the transaction .is. that they have the
headache and someone else has the cash.
But when Australians- brew’ their own beer
or make their own wine and the cash still
floats around in Australia, the country has
suffered no economic loss. Sending away
cash or p.n.’s-for motor-cars and trawlers
and tomato-sauce represents luxuriousness,
not because Australian people should travel
behind horses or refrain from catching fish
or follow-the-Iving in respect of sauce, but
because bringing these things into the coun-
try means sending out of the country that
which it most wants —cash to pay its dpbts,
and, just now, to meet the cost of war. Thus
a Yankee chair and a Japanese cup and a
British blanket are luxuries the use of which
are destructive of - the national economic
strength. On the other hand, a bottle of
Australian claret or an Australian-built
motor-car or a ■ stick of Australian tobacco
may be put to. : its appropriate use with-
out in any sense discounting the nation’s
ability to discharge its obligations, but
rather adding to i4 i.ts resources.
These vague appeals to the man in the
street to “cut off. bis luxuries in order to
strengthen the position of the Government.’’
with special emphasis on beer and tobacco
and motor-cars, are futile unless associated
with a clear understanding of (1)
what luxuries are. and (2) that the
luxuries which really have to be
tackled are tire disease and
the mania for borrowing. In the last year
for which figures are available. Australia
permitted herself the luxury of spending
abroad for imports the dreadful sum of
£77,010,343. Here are a few of the items: —
Foodstuffs £4,230,112
Non-alcoholic beverages .. 1.7/1,508
Apparel, textiles, etc... .. 19,742,595
Metals and machine]''.. .. 17,929,306
Jewellery and fancy goods .. 1,369,520
Earthenware, etc. . . 1,595,063
Paper and stationery . . . . 3,077,934
Chemicals and fertilisers . . 2,459,951
Oils, paints, fats . . . . 1,958,891
Miscellaneous . . . . . 10,930,138
And it is still going on. Australia lias also
permitted herself the further luxury of such
unrestrained borrowing and loafing on the
proceeds that her public debt is leaping up
towards What, then, is the
use of plaintively urging Bill Smith,
laborer, to help the nation become efficient
by knocking off his pint of beer and assist
in crushing the Ilun by doing without a
smoke? Bill Smith is not a fool. He
looks about him in Australia and sees that
the people lie is depending on to organise'
things and give a lead in efficiency are
calmly contemplating prodigal national lux-
uries without stirring a finger to stop them
—are countenancing a continuation of mul-
titudinous imports and are still borrowing
with demented zeal; that they countenance
the wild extravagance of seven Parliaments
and seven Cocked Hats; that the national
income even in ..time of war has been
muddled away by calamitous time-servers on
wheat deals and fodder imports and the
purchase of rancid butter. Let us keep to
the true meaning of things, and then per-
haps it will be seen that walking about in
a pair of imported boots and an exotic tile
is a luxury calling for immediate suppres-
sion, and going round in a locally-con-
structed motor a patriotic act of self-denial-
demanding enthusiastic encouragement.
THE WAR AND THE CADGE AND
THE DAYS TO COME.
Not long ago The Bulletin proposed to
appoint a Minister for Peace: and as the
weeks go on the need for the potentate
becomes so much greater that The Bulle-
tin now seconds its own motion. It does so
for two reasons. One is that in the judg-
ment of this paper the termination of the
Great Slaughter will bring Australia into
collision with issues as vital as those of the
war itself; the other, that unless a sharp
curve is taken in public policy the country
is going to be then in a very bad way. Is
there any objection to Australia being given
a chance? The Bulletin knows of none;
yet it is certain that the country has not
had one in the past, unless it was to slouch
along from year to year, sponging on tin
millions borrowed from Cohen by renegades
who betrayed the democracy. The dustbin
is very near, and unless tin 1 Australian
people are afforded opportunity to work-
not for foreign bondholders and shmdykits
and the whole tribe of interest- and rent-
mongers, but for Australia and for them*
selves —they are going to see most of their
ideals and not a few of their liberties go
into the receptacle.
How many of the politicians who are con-
fessing their wretched plight of living from
hand to mouth, or desperately clinging to
their precarious jobs, or furtively pursuing
Cohen through the labyrinths of finance for
the loan of a few millions to go on with, are
even considering what patriotism requires in
respect to the conditions that will arise when
peace is proclaimed? Careful search fails
to reveal any. Even the Federal Govern-
ment is shirking things as badly as the State
calamities. It has huddled the tariff away
out of sight; it has done nothing to check a
flood of imported goods fashioned by the
cheapest labor on the face of the earth ; it
is lavishing money on things that are not
vital; it is identifying itself with a scheme
of land purchase of which the central feature
is more pawn and more debt. Yet Ministers
know in their hearts what is going to happen
when the war is over, even though, like the
British Government, which knew that war
with Germany was certain, they have not
the moral courage to face the obligations
this knowledge imposes upon them. The
siviial of peace will cause the battered legions
in Europe to ground arms on a world
drenched with blood, to fall back into an
environment where industry has bben turned
upside down, where mountains of" debt have
grown to incredible height, and where the
maimed and the sick and the widow and
orphan are as numerous as the sands of the
sea. While the combatant countries have
been sowing the crop of dragon’s teeth,
others, standing apart, have been perfecting
their industrial methods, finding new avenues
of trade, taking up the job where the other
fellow knocked off, acquiring new ambitions
and strength to realise them. These things
are the commonplaces of the situation. They
involve considerations of the gravest'conse-
quence to Australia. What is being done
about them? One thing only and that at the
greatest possible speed—Nothing.
* * * *
The truth is that Australian political par-
ties are handling the national interests with
no more vision than might be expected from
a collection of village Bumbles faced with
the stupendous job of achieving a drain. At
the beginning, middle and end of their alleged
policy is a single word—loans. And it is
upon that they are depending to yield, them
relief from the distressful job of tolling tlteir
friends and supporters to get back to plain,
hard work, which is the only possible way
of salvation. A Minister for Peace, ought to
be considering where Australia is going to
discover herself at the end of the cadge—
for there must be an end somewhere. What
work will the people apply themselves, to and
how? To what extent should the importa-
tion of cheaply-manufactured goods go? And
if a fictitious prosperity can no longer be
maintained by borrowing to keep up the rate
of wages, what —and this is of the very
first importance—is the relationship between
land values and wages, in a country where
values have been inflated by a prodigalsex-
penditure of public money? The influences
at work in Australia to maintain high land
values and secure either low wages or cheap
goods are very powerful, and they have
grown in power of late. .To catch votes, -to
secure patronage, to obtain the ready means
of living an easy life, political parties of all
kinds have pandered to these anti-social
interests, and are now their creatures. Tin-
great danger confronting Australia now is
that if the loan-mongers find the supply cut
off at the meter, the clamor for “cheap”
goods will be louder in the land than evert
It can be heard even now, supported by
those whose pockets have been lined with
Cohen’s gold, and who see in cheap goods
the handiest prop for holding up those ex-
cessive land values which operate against the
settlement of Australia. How the indus-
trial development of the continent is going to
be promoted without a simultaneous expan-
sion of settlement; how the expansion of
settlement can proceed in the face of values
inflated by borrowing; and what the ideal of
a White Australia is going to look like after
the white race has been industriously pre-
vented from getting its roots into the soil—
The Bulletin knows none of these things.
But it reckons that for the sake of Australia
and what Australians are fighting for, and
the children who are growing up under the
Australian sun, they are worth thinking
about very seriously between now and the
shock that will follow the kennelling up -of
the bulldog.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Making Prisoners of War Pay.
When Fitzpatrick recently asked Holman
why the interned Germans were not furred
to earn their living in the concentration
camps he got the unsatisfying reply that
Andrew Fisher said it wasn’t British to
treat prisoners of war like that. If any of
them wanted to work they could get a job
cutting scrub, but if they didn’t 'they dould
remain as idle as cows until the war was
over. It may be quite true that this is
in line with English custom and still be
neither wise nor well. On the reasoning
that anything that is done in the land of
the ancient Britons should be imitated here
we should get some curious results. For
instance, it has been the British custom to
give as much employment as possible to
cheap niggers at the expense of white men
who in consequence go hungry; and it is a
fixed habit with British statesmen to never
b> prepared when any great crisis arises.
Are we to copy these things as well as the
notion that prisoners of war should lie a
burden on those who have to keep them?
Some British ideas are all right and a great
many are all wrong. If we can see a way
to better any of them, in Heaven’s name
why not try? This question of allowing
prisoners to loaf can be argued out without
reference to the present custom in London
or the practice which was common in the
days of Queen Elizabeth. If you wage
war successfully you have enemy prisoners,
and the more successfully you wage it the
more prisoners you have. If those prisoners
do not earn their keep your success in war
becomes a heavier and heavier burden, and
if you can keep the success going long enough
to acquire sufficient prisoners the time must
come when the load of their idleness and
expense becomes great enough, to turn your
success into failure. Australia can’t afford
to feed Germans for nothing. Let them be
put to work. War is war; and while it
would be indecent to make prisoners actu-
ally kill their compatriots, there is no
earthly reason why we should permit them
to diminish our resources. It, was through
prisoners of war that ancient Rome grew
wealthy ; but Australia, on her present plan,
only wants to be loaded m- sufficiently with
such material to become bankrupt.
A Disease the Doctor Doesn’t.

Tiie trouble about Attorney-General
Hughes’s Metals Exchange scheme for end-
ing the German hold on the Australian metal
business is that it is mostly a wrong diag-
nosis and a consequent, wash; of valuable
time. It overlooks the principal difficulties.
In the first place it’ is assumed tlijit Ger-
many has been taking the bulk of our
metals, and-Che assumptiou'ls'entirely; wrong.
Here is a list, cann'piled from official sources,
for 1913: —
Silver-Lead. Zinc. Copper.
(let-manv . . £222,768 £385.079 £367,235
Belgium .. 1,452,808 1,403,139 725,232
France .. 74,470 151,283 157,043
U.S.A. 710,086
Belgium and France are Allies, and it is
proposed not to interfere with them. .;of
course. * Now these official figures make it:
plain that to these two Allies we in 1913
sent £3,9(50.975 worth of the four metals,
while the exports to Germany amounted to
only £975,0N2. It is perfectly true, no
doubt, that a vast quantity of the ore and
concentrates which were shipped to: Bel-
gium and France, and a further very
-considerable quantity that was shipped to
Holland, went to works controlled by
Germans. But how is a Metal Exchange
going to stop that? Especially how is an
Exchange going to stop it after the war?
During the war the Exchange is not needed
for the purpose. The Customs see to it
that no metal is shipped that is likely to fall
into the hands of enemies : hence the Broken
Hill cos. have had to satisfy the Minister that
their zinc shipments to the U.S.A. were not
for German buyers. The trouble will come
after the war. Can the Attorney-General
explain how the Exchange is then going to
stop the export of, say. zinc concentrates to
the works at Liege, in Belgium, on the
ground that Germans are allegedly interested
in that business? There are works in
Britain in which Germans a re, Mice wise inter-
ested. Will he also refuse to permit con-
centrates to be sent to Britain if they are
liable to fall into the hands of those works?
Nothing is surer than that, when the world
is again at peace, works in Belgium will be
Belgian works and works in France will be
French works, no matter who owns them;
and any prohibition against the export of ore
to Belgian and French ports, on the ground
that Belgium and France will make a bad
use mf the metal, will be regarded as an act
most unfriendly to the Allies. Our one
hope is the establishment of works in Aus-
tralia and Britain, and the granting of some
sort of preference to Australian and British
smelters; but that cannot be done through
a Metal Exchange. There is no reason at
all why Australia and Britain should not
smelt all- the ores—none, that is. apart
from the labor difficulty. And that, unfor-
tunately,,is a tremendously large one. For
10 years the Central Zinc Co., in which an
Australian mining concern is largely inter-
ested! has been attempting to smelt zinc
concentrates at Seaton Carew, after failing
to (firry on the iudustiiv successfully in
N. S. Wales ; and it has been so unprofitable
that 'no dividend has ever been paid except
the small one guaranteed by the Australian
mining co. which promoted the English con-
cern. If the business is to be successfully estab-
lished in Australia or Britain it will call for
large monetary assistance in the shape of
bonuses or otherwise, just, as the iyon in-
dustry called for similar assistance in Aus-
tralia. If the works are not established,
plainly all the Metal Exchanges in the world
will not enable us to sell our ores, etc., to
The Servian.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Grimly lie stands to guard his hills,
Face forward to the cannon’s roar
That all his world with murder fills
And scatters death about his door.
The black sky flames, the foemen urge
The furious onset fast and loud ;
The human breakers nearer surge.
And still his eye is set and proud.
A year of strife at cruel odds
That follows centuries of pain
Beneath the cursftd Turkish rods
The Teuton lords would bring again ;
And still he stands with knee unbent.
The wreck of war about him hurled;
This day his bitter strength is lent
As foremost picket of the world.
He fed his swine beneath the oak
When Islam walked with murder red.
And smote bis land with stroke on stroke
Till hope within his heart seemed dead ;
But in his dreamings of the night
He saw a glory round him wake.
All ere, standing foremost in the fight,
He grasped a sword for freedom’s sake.
And now the splendid dream comes true,
The rugged lines of strife re-form,
And flashing out in all men’s view
He braves the thunders and the storm.
And shall he fail, and must he fall?
The ranks of Marathon are set.
Through the red rifts of bai tie’s pall
The lightnings show him standing yet!

Party Government and a Peacock with
a Moulting Tail.
Victorian Premier Peacock must these
days feel about the cheapest kind of politi-
cian who ever borrowed a million. Even a
majority of the Liberals have told him they
are full up. Yet he hangs on to his job, an
object of derision even to the Akgus. A
month or so ago Elmslie, the Labor leader,
moved a vote of want-of-confidence in the
Ministry, and to a man the Liberals rushed
in to avert such a horrible calamity as
defeat at the hands of the Opposition. But
many Liberals liked not their Peacock’s
ways, and privately called round to explain
how delighted they would be if he handed
his resignation to the party Caucus in order
that a new Ministry might be chosen. But
Peacock and Murray were not having any-
thing like that, and after much wirepulling
and wrangling McLeod, leader of the recal-
citrant Liberals, launched another no-confi-
dence motion, in the fond hope, perhaps,
that Elmslie would help to turn the Govern-
ment out. But that is just where the bomb
missed fire. Party considerations had to be
weighed, and the result was that, on divi-
sion, 21 Liberals who had supported Pea-
cock against Elmslie voted now for
McLeod against Peacock, and 23 Laborites
who had previously tried to fire the Ministry
out leaped forward to reinforce the rump
of 17 Liberals (eight of them Ministers)
who were standing true to their joss. Thus
McLeod fell into the tureen, and by the
grace of Elmslie the bacon was saved. So
Peacock is still in charge of the coach after
two-thirds of the members of the Assembly
have within a few weeks told him he ought
to be in the ditch —all of which is a pleasant
commentary on the monumental idiocy of
Government by Chunks. Peacock and his
colleagues are in a hopeless minority, and
the system under which popular government
works, is so demented that, because the
majority, are bound by the shackles of party,
the administration of public affairs remains
in the hands of men without a moral claim
upon the posts they fill. Such a posifion is
more than absurd. It is horribly dangerous.
It represents the negation of democracy-—-
the degradation of Parliamentary control.
The only possible relief is to free the Legis-
lature from, the existing system under which
Cabinets seize the machinery of government,
and. in its place, institute the rational alter-
native of Elective Ministries. Then mem-
bers of the Legislature would be given at
least, a working chance to look after the
public’s affairs. As it is now these are the
last things they are concerned about, prin-
cipal consideration being given to whether
their particular party is In or whether there
are ways of keeping another crowd Out.
And the poor old Sovereign People who gird
up their loins every three years to straighten
things out get it in the neck all the time.
The Returned Soldier.
Sydney papers last week printed the wail
of Private G. Owen, who returned disabled
from Gaba Tepe, and had an eye on some
land offered on the Wyalong-Lake Cudgellico
line:—-
On application to the Lands Department I find that
all the help I can get is preference in the ballot,
t rom the official statements and the posters at every
post office, etc., I thought I would be assisted in
every wav to get a start. I am told that I shall be
able to get assistance from the Government Savings
Bank on the usual terms. What good is that to a
private getting ss. a day, and who may be able to
raise £5O? Then, again, these farms are to be
leasehold for all time. I don’t call that a fair
deal. I think a man should be able to look forward
to it being his own some day. Anyway, the Lands
Department cannot tell me how I am going to get
a start on the land. Who can ?
This brings us right up against our
difficulties. Whenever any trouble threatens
about unemployed, the cry is “Put them
on the land !” To “go on the land” appears
to the babblers of the cities to be
the easiest thing in the world. But
when a man is right up against
the land, it begins to look an entirely
different proposition. This man was offered
preference in the ballot. The following
paragraph from one of last week’s papers
shows what that means:—
There were 308 applicants before the Walgett
Land Board yesterday for a Crown lease at Eurie
Eurie. The Board disallowed all the applications
except that of Richard Willis, a returned soldier,
this decision being arrived at in consequence of the
expressed desire that returned soldiers should receive
preference at the ballot.
First, then, the returned soldier gets this
preference. Then he is offered assistance
from the Savings Bank “on the usual terms.”
But what good, Owen asks, is that to a man
who can’t raise more than £5O? Many of
these men can’t raise, perhaps, 50 shillings.
What are we going to do about them? If
we put them on the land as farmers they
will want stock and plant; they will want
fences and improvements, if the country is
new; they will have some clearing to do;
they will have to be carried over two years—
perhaps more—before they get any crop
worth mentioning. Who is going to advance
the money?' The State Savings Bank?
That institution is the trustee of the people’s
savings. Would any trustee be justified
in advancing* money, without security, to
(say) keep a man going on a farm before
he had proved that he had any knowledge
of farming or any ' aptitude for a job at
which there are far more failures than
successes. From a business point of view
the thing is preposterous. l T et Owen tells
us the plain truth. To a man without
money a mere leasehold farming selection is
no good. Preference at the ballot is no good.
Financial assistance on the usual terms is no
good. He must have a very great: deal more
than all that. And it is on this basis that the
people who propose to get over the unem-
ployed-soldier problem must proceed. It
makes their difficulties enormously greater, of
course; but you don’t get over difficulties by
refusing to see them. In the end. perhaps
they may realise that “going on the land”
isn’t the only panacea worth attention. They
may even realise that it is an extremely
costly and an extremely uncertain panacea.

The Key of India.
How the old gags linger on from age to
ago ! Somebody once said that Constanti-
nople was the key of Asia, and since then
every person who has to waste printer’s ink
in discussing any question that has the re-
motest connection with the Turk has given
the old key business a fresh airing. Yet can
any person, looking at a map of the world,
explain in what sense Constantinople is
more a key to the parts of Asia that really
count than Smyrna, Bey rout, Port Said.
Suez or even Odessa and TrebizondV Con-
stantinople was certainly the key to that
least valuable part of Asia which is nearest
to Europe in days when the sea formed a
serious barrier, and an overland route was
the thing to be desired ; but to-day it is no
more the key to India, China and the rich
tangle of islands and peninsulas lying north-
west of Australia than Calcutta is the key to
N. S. Wales. Those portions of Asia which
lie nearest to the Ottoman capital were once
the genuine article —tilled with wealthy
Greek cities and roaring with commerce —
but to-day they are mostly ruins, brigands,
raisins and goats. Just beyond them in
classic times were the prosperous regions of
Syria and the Euphrates Valley, with Jew-
ville and its cash-laden pilgrim traffic to the
south ; and even the very desert itself blos-
somed into wealth and splendor where Pal-
myra raised her columns and temples to the
glory of a caravan trade which tilled all the
pads from east to west with the smell of
unending camel. Now that land also is a
waste, with only a spot here and there of
sufficient attractiveness to lure the covetous
gaze of the international plunderer. Fur-
ther on, beyond the Euphrates, in Roman
times and earlier, was all the wealth of
Persia and Parthia. To-day Persia is a poor
sort of place, and Afghanistan is richer in
natural obstacles to an army’s march than
in flocks, herds or ready cash. Yet an in-
vader seeking to strike India overland from
Constantinople would have to traverse the
poor territories of Asia Minor, cross the
waste and ruin of Syria into the greater
waste of the Euphrates Valley, negotiate
the difficulties of moribund but angry Persia,
face the mountains, defiles and handy knives
of Afghanistan, and arrive at last at the
tremendous natural barrier of India to find
its passes fortified more strongly than the
Dardanelles. If Constantinople is the key
of richer Asia it is a key .that turns grat-
ingly in the lock. On the other hand. Egypt,
as the guardian of the great ditch between
the Mediterranean and the Red Sea. is on
the water route to India, and may be re-
garded in some sense as a latch to the
Asiatic door. But Constantinople is not the
gate of Egypt in any very practical sense;
for the desert where the children of Jacob
wandered in the years before they learned to
shout the odds is a very dry desert, and
could not be crossed by any force worth
mentioning except in the slowest of slow
time. _ For practical war purposes Toulon
is quite as good a base for an attack on
Egypt as Constantinople, while Brindisi is
a much better one, and even Plymouth and
Southampton are not greatly inferior to the
place where the Turk sits. Whoever cap-
tures the capital of the old Eastern Empire
will get a lot of dirt, a certain amount of
"lory, and a number of difficult problems, but
he won’t be able to step out of the back gate
into India or throw his boots at the Sphinx
without facing greater undertakings than
any which Europe herself can offer.

The Honorable Jimmy Woodser.
The Westralian Parliament has introduced
into its new Licensing Bill a clause which
forbids “shouting” under a penalty of £5.
This is hitting the demon Dr-r-rink exactly
where he lives. Without the shouting fea-
ture a bar will become something like a
chemist’s shop with a different smell, and
the sad, lonely consumers of Jimmy
Woodsers will stand as solitary pillars of
the temple of Bung communing in silence
with their own dreary souls, until by sheer
weight of alcohol they fall down or are
carried out or fade away into the friendless
night. Nobody can doubt that the abolition
of shouting, if it can be carried out effect-
ively, will reduce drinking for a while:
but human nature is a strangely adjustable
mechanism, and after a spell of partial
abstinence will probably adapt itself to the
new conditions and drink as cheerfully from
its lonely pewter as it did when it lifted
its glass to the level of its nose and mur-
mured “’Sluek” in honor of the man who
paid. What the Westralian legislators fail
to take account of is the extreme ease with
which the new provision can be evaded. All
that the publican need do is to erect a
small-change counter near the entrance to
his bar, where any number of sixpences and
threepenny bits may be obtained in exchange
for larger coins. The shouter with four
friends will then merely obtain change, hand
a coin to each, and the five Will breast the
bar in the old fashion without fear of pains
or penalties. Tinkering with the liquor
question is apt to be foolish business. The
one redeeming feature of the whole thing is
its social aspect, the promoting of good fel-
lowship and the drawing closer together of
those who allow alcohol to loosen their
tongues and soften their hearts; and
in taking away the right of a drink-
ing person to pay for his friend’s
refreshment you are taking away the
only thing which offers any sort of
excuse for the existence of a bar at all. It
is more logical to abolish drinking places
altogether than to leave them open for men
to view one another with cold eyes at their
grim and solitary guzzling.
The Unspeakable Turk in Palestine.
From the Very Key. P. B. Kennedy, 0.F.M.,
the Australian authority on these matters: —
The position of the Christians in Jerusalem, and
all through Palestine, is heartrending, if the cable
message from Alexandria to Le Temps, of Paris,
which appeared in the daily press a week ago, can
be relied upon. According to that message the Ger-
mans have erected musketry butts on Golgotha, and
are training Turkish sharpshooters there. They have
turned the friars out of their convents and monas-
teries, which they have transformed into barracks.
Mount Olivet is a drill-ground, and every road
in that land where the Saviour was born, and lived,
and died is full of caravans bearing munitions and
other supplies.
From the beginning of the War it was foreseen that
should Turkey take part in it the consequences for
the Christians of the Holy Land would be extremely
serious. Even before the declaration of hostilities
the Sultan's Government, taking advantage of the
international muddle, abolished the Capitulations,
which had guaranteed to Europeans the protection of
their respective consuls. The privilege which ren-
dered the hateful Christian independent of Moham-
medan jurisdiction was always protested against by
the Turk ; consequently the moment the opportunity
offered itself he had it annulled. It is true the
European Powers remonstrated ; the Mussulman only
grinned. He knew the inability of the Powers to
enforce their rights, and he went on his way perse-
cuting the hated race, and laughing all the time.
Heavy taxes were imposed on the inhabitants. All
the men between 18 and 50 were mobilised. Horses,
camels, mules and donkeys were seized. The soldiery
raided the shops, the storerooms and the vineyards,
and poverty, suffering and destitution prevail all
round. Those Christians belonging to the Allied
nations were cast into prison and then sentenced to
transportation. Like cattle they were driven from
Jerusalem to Orpha, in Mesopotamia. Aged people
were hustled along the rugged roads of Judea and
Galilee, and over the mountains, suffering from
hunger, and with bleeding feet. At Siloh, a village
beyond Naplouse, they were packed into a train and
sent to Damascus, where they arrived, almost dead,
after 26 hours of terrible hardships. What happened
to the Christians scattered over Syria and Asia
Minor we cannot tell. In those out-of-the-way places,
where horrible crimes may be committed with impu-
nity, the Christian is at the mercy of the fanatical
rabble, against whom the Government is powerless,
especially in time of war.
As Commissary of the Holy Land in this country
I make this appeal to the generous people of Aus-
tralia, non-Catholic as well as Catholic, for help to
save the lives of those Christians who are suffering
unheard-of distress in that land; and to give fur-
ther information on the subject I have published a
booklet, entitled “The Crusader,” which may be had
at the principal bookstalls.
Father Kennedy’s address is Waverley
(N.S.W.)', should anyone interested in this
distressing subject care to go into the matter
with him.

The individual loafer can always find an
excuse for his loafing; the collective loafer
has his excuses found for him by
the newspapers. The Australasian Mer-
chants’ Association in London having
made the very reasonable suggestion
that some preparations should be made
to block German and Austrian and
Turkish trade after the war, Sydney Tele
graph remarks loftily: “No exception can
be taken to the motives which prompt these
proposals. [Think of that!] But it is
far more important just now- to get the war
over than to contemplate antagonistic action
against trade of the present enemies after
the war has concluded.” It’s a pretty
lullaby this, and there might be some shred
of excuse for it if every one was so busily
employed helping to win the war that the
building of to-morrow’s trade rampart could
only now be undertaken at grave risk. But
it is not so, and nobody knows it better than
the papers. The army abroad is doing work
that will have to be paid for presently when
the lOU falls due; and if the people at
home are quick enough, the machinery for
repayment will be ready when the boys come
marching home to draw their last military
pay and look for a job. But if the news-
paper-reading shirkers at home salve their
consciences with the thought that a certain
amount of land is to be made available for
returned soldiers, and that there is still
something left of the big patriotic funds,
this country will presently be full of unem-
ployed fighting men with ruined tempers
and prospects, and little else besides. Every
stay-at-home citizen will then be regarded
a? fair prey by embittered Soldiers who will
remember that they saved the miserable non-
combatant who wouldn’t even save them a
job. And, of course, the wretched ass with
the job will have to pay all the bills he
might have shared with others had he dis-
played a little energy and foresight.

Three State Treasurers ambled forward
with their Budgets last week— Peacock
(Vic.) to explain that the current year
would yield a deficit of £233,000 and the
hole be plugged up with p.n.’s; Ryan (Q. »
with an estimated shortage of £370,564, and
taxation proposals for keeping solvent; and
Crawford Vaughan (S.A.) to report that
ends hadn’t been meeting, and the public
would have to pay up quite a lot more. In
each case the borrowings have been tremen-
dous, and the annual interest-bill lias gone
up with a bang. For the hundredth time
The Bulletin therefore asks some profes-
sional borrower to define the stage at which
loans start to earn their own keep. Thus far
the more the States have borrowed the
deeper the people have had to dredge into
their pockets to pay Cohen the interest
that the loans haven’t earned. In 1005 the
States owed £57 per head and the taxes
were 10s. lOd. per head. In 1910 the loans
were up to £59 per head, and it became
necessary for the people to pay ISs. 7d. per
head in State taxes. By 1914 the States
owed Coiien £65 per head, and the taxes
necessary to square the interest bill had
bounded along to £1 ss. lid. per head.
When is the insanity going-to stop?
A Super-Tax Bill read a second time in the
N. S. Wales Assembly proposes that in cer-
tain “land-locked” districts owners of land
iu excess of £5OOO in unimproved value
shall be treated this way:—
Unless within 12 months after notification thev
cultivate in the first year one-tenth of the area, in
the sec-ond and third year one-fourth, in the fourth
one-third, and in the fifth one-half they will pay a
super-tax rising - from 2d. in the pound to 9d. in
successive years'.
Why there should be au exemption is easily
explained—votes. And the exemption will
make~the Bill a much blunter tool for
encouraging settlement than it looks. Take
the case of a man with property in one of
these agricultural districts valued at £lO.OOO
(unimproved) ; and call it 2000 acres. With
the exemption of £5OOO the cultivation he
has to do will work out this way: In the
first year, 100 acres; second and third, 250
acres; fourth, 333 acres; and then 500 acres.
This is not going to make many more stalks
of wheat or blades of grass shoot than are
shooting now. In the coastal districts, on
the tablelands and western slopes, to part
of which the Bill will apply, less than 4 per
cent, of the land is cultivated, and how much
more of it will be so dealt with is indicated
by the comment of the Minister for Bands
on his own measure—that it will “only
affect 2000 of the very largest landlords.’’
His aim, apparently, is to do good by stealth,
and for that purpose he has diluted the acid
s > as to take the sting out of it —except as to
the owners of a mere 2000 votes.

Last week an Italian newspaper stated that
‘ Germany and Bulgaria came to treaty terms
as long ago as April last. We were told
that “the British Legation in Athens has
received unimpeachable information of the
existence of the secret Bulgar-German treaty
in question.” Six months after the event
the British ambassador to Greece learned
what had happened! The British ambas-
sador in Bulgaria maybe knew nothing about
the document up to the very day of his
departure. But whether they knew of it or
not, Robert Blatchford declares that the
Balkan embassies 'warned the British Gov-
ernment, but couldn't persuade it, that the
new German menace was as real as the old
German menace, which was laughed to scorn
by the pro-German schemers of two years
ago. What a genius Britain has for falling
into pits! It seems almost as if Nature
made her that way in order to give her a
chance to show her almost equal genius
for struggling out of them.

-Replying to inquiries from Sydney,
Adrian Knox and Norman Brookes, the
Red Cross agents in Egypt, cabled that they
could get no proof at all of the alleged sale
of Red Cross comforts to wounded soldiers.
That is satisfactory; yet The Bulletin
receives the following from “Rosna,” its old
Adelaide contributor, who has been working
among the Australian soldiers ever since
the first of them landed in England :
There’s room for ugly rumors with regard to Aus-
tralia’s Red Cross gifts to her wounded. Tommy,
battered at the Dardanelles, tells some startling
stories; and, using all the salt you like, they cannot
all be legends. 1 have talked to some hundreds of
men, and never have I met one ivlio said he had
received an Australian lied Cross gift for nothing.
Dozens .said they had bought articles of every
description, both in Egypt and on the hospital ships,
which often bore the names of the donors at home.
Condensed milk, labelled “Australian Red Cross
gifts for the wounded,” had, they assured me, been
sold to them at lOd. a tin; cigarettes, also labelled,
were sold to them at 2d. a packet. In Cairo, at a
native shop, one man with whom I talked told me
he had bought a cake and found in the tin a note
from the giver in Australia, asking the Australian
soldier who received it to write to her. The
[a well-known Australian ship], which lately arrived
with wounded, carried thousands of Australian Red
Cross shirts and pyjamas, duly stamped. These
things were, I am assured, given out to the British
Tommies, while our own asked for them in vain.
The reason offered was that the Australian received
seven shillings a day while Mr. Atkins only got a
single bob, and that the Australian should be able
to pay for things. In short, the Commonwealth’s
fair treatment of her men was made the pretext
for depriving them of- the things made expressly for
them by their own mothers and sisters. These
allegations reach one from all types of men, and I
am fully satisfied there is at least sufficient truth in
them to call for decisive action from home. Can’t
responsible persons be posted off to Egypt, Malta
and London to receive goods and personally see
that the Australian in hospital gets what he needs
in the way of comforts? And, incidentally, though
this is of secondary importance, they owe it to the
world to get on to the tracks of the depraved
middlemen who have, it seems, made a competency
out of the benevolence of Australian women on the
one side and the sufferings of Australian men on the
other.
The “responsiblbe persons” have gone to
Egypt and the Mediterranean, so we may
reasonably assume that the wicked prac-
tices. of the past have been stopped. But
it is none the less the duty of somebody to
get on the track of the .Tudases who for-
merly sinned, unless all these men are liars.
Surely we have had enough proof that the
policy of “Hush !” is disastrous in the long
run.
When all the talk in Melbourne, about fish
—the high price of it, the variable nature
of the demand and the uncertaintv of the
supply—has been boiled down, the conclu-
sion is that more could be sold, at lower
prices than now rule, if the community
would conspire to have three recognised fish
days in each week. Friday is a popular
fish-dinner day with Roman Catholics, and
some others who liaye cultivated the Catholic
habit. But the trade’s knowledge of what
ti expect goes no further than that. On
other days housewives can’t be sure of
obtaining the goods at a moderate price, the
reason being that fishermen cannot send
their “catch” to market with the certainty
of the market being lively. One of the trade,
writing to the Age. said :
Last summer and winter at many different times
I allowed over 100 tons of prime fish to escape from
my nets instead of securing them and sending the
whole catch to market. Had I sent the whole haul
to market it would have caused a glut.
If the market were organised by arrange-
ment with General Desire, and the fish
appetite of that perennial warrior were sys-
tematically catered for. there would be no
glut. The first practical reform is to agree
on “fish days.” What about a referendum to
settle which days they shall be?

The One Thing Needful—Men, and
More Men.
The most exasperating part of the whole
business has been the persistent humbugging
of the people about the military position—
the clumsy effort to make black look as if it
were white. It was known months ago that
the campaign in Gallipoli had been fumbled.
Yet the public was doped from week to week
with cock-and-bull yarns about important
successes being achieved by the Allies and
the Turk being in despair and on the verge
of revolution. The influence of an ignorant
censorship on the public mind and on the
conduct of the war has been disastrous. The
Turk and the German have known the posi-
tion at Gallipoli. Why should the people in
England and Australia not have been
allowed to know it, so that they might realise
the alternative to putting forward the last
ounce of the nation’s strength? Of course,
there is no rational answer to such a ques-
tion. And it seems to The Bulletin that
even now the situation is being faced by
officialdom with grudging resentment of the
repeated demands for candor. However, the
position—or at any rate, some of it —has
been made clearer lately, and it boils down
to this: "if sufficient men capable of bearing
arms continue to read the alleged accounts
of .the proceedings instead of imparting first-
hand information to the enemy with a
bayonet, matters will get no better,
and that very quickly. Where Greece and
Roumania find themselves just now —and
this paper views them both with the cold eye
of suspicion—is a question of far less im-
portance than where the men of the British
Empire are. If they were in the
right place these two others wouldn’t
be far away, and Bulgaria wouldn’t
be < where it is now, either. The
issue of the war, instead of being terribly
uncertain to-day, would then be as sure as
the rising of to-morrow’s sun. For, powerful
though she is, Germany is bleeding. Her
great campaign against Russia has, so far
as it has extended beyond Warsaw, been a
strategical failure. Austria is becoming
negligible as an ally. Hence the attempt to
join hands with Abdul, and by victory in
the Balkans bring to her aid three addi-
tional countries. If that attempt should
succeed —and it never would have been made
if the enterprise at Gallipoli had not been
muddled —the end of things will be a long
way off, and a lot of new things will be up
for inspection. But if the wheel could be
spragged—and it will be if the Allies can
hurry up in sufficient numbers —then the
German will be caged in a ring of iron to
bleed some more. Meanwhile there comes
along the stimulating remark of the Japan-
ese Minister for Marine that “the majority of
the English people are apparently quite un-
concerned.” Apart from the comfort it gives
to know that this is the impression officially
entertained at Tokio, suppose that the same
idea is entertained at Berlin and becomes
prevalent also at the capitals of combatant
and neutral countries?
Pi’emier Vaughan, of S.A., who is his
own Treasurer, unfolded his Budget in a
mere 90-minute speech. Revenue, he said,
had been the lowest since 1908-9; but he
now figures on a record harvest of 29 mil-
lion bushels, with the difference this will
make all round. Meanwhile, money has to
be found, so income-tax exemption is to be
reduced from £4 a w r eek to £3, with a super-
tax on the higher revenues. Private motor-
cars are to pay a bit, receipt-stamps go up
from Id. to 2d., and a little further help is
to be got from the handy totalisator, which
already pays the Racing Club Is. 6d. and
the Government 6d. in every pound. In-
creased land-tax and death-duties are to find •
the rest.
Woman is still incomprehensible. In
Melbourne last week Maria Black left her
home in North Melbourne carrying a loaded
revolver, called on Mrs. Mabel Weston a
few streets away, and casually shot her
dead, without argument. When the police
arrived they found Valdo Pinsack, a
Spaniard, weeping copiously. Asked what
the trouble was about Miss Black said that
Pinsack was violently in love with her, and,
though she didn’t care a bit about him,.she
desired him to leave Mrs. Weston’s, where
he lodged, because Mrs. Weston had per-
sistently “come between” them. It was a
woefully inadequate explanation, and unless
Maria Black can skirmish up a better it
seems possible that she may strike trouble.
The Navy Department has done the right
thing in regard to the Emden relics. Months
ago it invited tenders for salving Australia’s
first big naval prize; but all the people who
were prepared to contract wanted the right
to exhibit the battered warship. The idea
of turning the carcase into a side-show was,
of course, not to be entertained; and the
Navy Department has therefore broken off
all negotiations and decided to do the salving
itself. So a ship with the necessary appli-
ances goes to see if the craft is well enough
to be moved.
The private lessee goes out of the N.S.W.
Railway Refreshment Rooms at the end of
this year, and the Railway authorities them-
selves enter the business. A manager has
been appointed at £750 a year to look after
things, and if between them they can’t make
a success of it, the time will have arrived
for facing the situation calmly and allowing
every traveller to cook a bit of damper in
the locomotive firebox.
Many Broken Hill unionists on Eight
Hours’ Day wore a little red badge, which
read, “If you want a 44-hours week, take it.”
The advice seems good. But why the 40?
If you want only as much as you can pro-
duce in four hours, why work the 40? There
are just these two things to remember: (1)
No country can have more than it produces,
unless it is a lending country; (2) a bor-
rowing country must produce its interest,
and can only cut up for itself what is left
over. The latter is Australia’s position.
It can’t even have all it produces, thanks to
its terrific borrowings.

In the poker game now being played
nightly at Sydney Criterion, “A Pair of
Sixes” seems likely long to prove a winning
hand. This U.S. farce has two virtues: it
becomes funnier with each succeeding act,
and, though the plot is preposterous, the
people in it are real. They do not act farci-
cally because they are in a farce. There are
two pill-merchants who quarrel like Potash
and Perlmutter. One had invented the high
explosive in the interior of the shell; the
other had made and tinted the shell casing;
and each naturally thinks, and says, that all
the virtues of the abdominal shrapnel are due
to his portion of the manufacture. For the
dozenth time they call in their lawyer to
settle the dispute. He suggests several sane
methods of patching up a truce, but, these
failing, he apparently invents on the spot an
incredibly footling and impossible arrange-
ment. The partners are to play one hand of
poker, and the loser is to become the other’s
man-servant for 12 months. The weakness
of the introduction of this idea is obvious.
It sprang from a chance remark made during
the disputes of the partners, but the lawyer
instantly dictates a complicated legal agree-
ment, the details of which are too many to
remain in the minds of the audience. And
there is no suggestion that making one part-
ner buttle for the other for a year will im-
prove the management of the business or the
interior or exterior of the pill. However, the
dramatist’s troubles ! Or the audience’s !
The farce starts slowly, but once the
buttling begins the audience settles down to
a crescendo of laughter. And the laughter
is all the more spontaneous because the
people in the play are so obviously in earn-
est. George Barnum, who, it may be stated
for the information of the audience, is the
tall, bald gentleman who issues modestly
forth at the final curtain and combines in
one conjurer’s gesture a gracious bow to the
audience and an imperative order to the man
in the flies to ring down the rag and get the
silly extra-turn over, has gathered an admir-
able cast, without which this farce would
assuredly fail. Tom Shelford is a decided
acquisition to the Firm. His performance as
the manufacturer of the assorted filling of the
violet-tinted shell-case is delightfully easy
and subtly humorous. He is a comedian
with brains. John Webster, the other part-
ner, is a comedian with gestures. They are
funny gestures, of course—but there is a
difference. He makes an altogether estimable
butler. The complications that keep the plot
going are feminine. One partner is married,
the other, who has to buttle, is engaged. And
the butler has to buttle in the presence of his
amazed sweetheart. Both complications are
charming. Ethel Dane, another bargain
acquired by the fortunate Firm, is the dainti-
est and most alluring wife of a pill-foundry
that this paper has ever had the fortune to

The maid of all work falls desperately in
love with the pill-owner butler (John
Webster).
meet. She has hysterics in a manner so
alluring, and with such delightful legs, that
the habit of hysterics is likely to become
popular. Beatrice Nicholls, as the engaged
lady who is buttled by her lover, again shows
herself possessed of considerable dramatic
ability and a high appreciation of genuine
humor. One success of the performance is
in the quite unnecessary and much hackneyed
part of the sort of slavey that not even the
most degraded pill-merchant would have on
the premises. Florence Gleeson takes this
part, and plays its absurdities with such sin-
cerity that she makes it human —an astonish-
ing feat of acting. She gets the full value
from its absurdities, but she leaves at the
last a sympathetic feeling on the mind of the
audience. “Poor old thing!” they almost
say, forgetting that she is merely supposed to
be impossible. The only other person who
has a lot to do is Tom MacLarnie, the law-
yer, and he does it.
“Potash and Perlmutter’’ are advertised

Annie Kent, a brisk comedienne with

Sydney Tivoli. The Payolas, classical acro-

stand shoulder to shoulder with her in an
artistic sense. Ida Barr, the command-
ing, deep-voiced lady who is said to be clever
in spite of her red hair, has reappeared like
a moving tower, and Duncan and Godfrey
are still demonstrating how refreshing old
turns can be when they are well and truly
done.
“A PAIR OF SIXES," AT SYDNEY
CRITERION.
The senior pill-owner (Tom Shelford)
receives a pair of sixes from the lawyer
(Tom MacLarnie).
Most of us being financially lamed so far
as foreign travel is concerned, the film
record of the Panama Exposition, now show-
ing at Sydney Royal for one brief week,
seems to deserve the cash welcome it is
getting. When you can’t reach out for the
distant substance it is pleasant to have
the shadow thrown in front of you by the
infernal machine with the blazing eye and
the chattering metallic teeth. The tempo-
rary palaces that will be torn down when
the glorious show is over look real enough
on the screen, and the numbers of people
scooting about suggest that the ill-timed
burst paid its way—though there are grave
doubts about it. Unless producer William
A. Read changes his mind, the visions will
flicker out at the end of this week.

Just for six nights only “Bonnie Mary of
Argyle” is keeping the Bert Bailey Co. busy
at Melbourne King’s. Villainy in this
gentle, nicely-staged melodrama never goes
to and the chief cause of suffering
to the heroine is her own foolishness. She
is neither blithe nor trusting, she doesn’t
attempt a Scawtch accent, and the bairn
she talks about is conspicuous by its ab-
sence. She even fails to suggest a tender
hairt. In fact, Mary, as presented by
Miss Agnes Keogh, seems incapable of
bursting into tears, which is a fatal defect
in a heroine with nobody to blame but her-
self. The surly husband who doubts Mary’s
propriety is a bit of a dismal ass, all things
considered, but that is no excuse for the
young woman’s neglect to clear up her
matrimonial misunderstandings and bring
the artless melodrama to a close. Owing to
Mary’s absurdity a base young character
named Stephen succeeds in getting her
divorced from her gloomy husband, and this
enables a loud, dissembling Lady Lucy to
almost succeed in marrying the gloomy per-
son herself, s>’though she had promised her
hand to the bad, infatuated young man afore-
said. Finally the fraudulent co-respondent
confesses the in-no-cence of Mary, and baffled
Lady Lucy is done brown.

Outside the boundaries of this bloodless
narrative flows a broad stream of comedy
relief. Though not a sparkling stream it is
clean and bright enough. Bailey, disguised
as Hon. Bertie somebody, is the joker-in-
chief, and Laura Roberts helps him to make
the show pleasant. Also Harford shines
with unwonted lustre as a braw Donald who
exacts compensation for being wounded
below the kilt, and Fred Macdonald imparts
an occasional air of cheerfulness to Ebenezer
Moss, the kindest and most obliging Jew
money-lender that never was. Guy Has-
tings is the unamiable husband, Lilias Ade-
son is a crude and confident Lady Lucy; the
inevitable Bellairs is a flippant, sneerful
villain; and Duggan is supposed to be old
Angas Melrose, of the Heeland persuasion,
which is a decidedly tough supposition. This
next and last week of the Bert Bailey Go.
will be devoted to “The Ninety and Nine.”

The Bulletin has seen many more arrest-
ing and original shows than “The Dancing
Mistress,” , which arrived at Melbourne
Majesty’s on Saturday night. Its adherence
to the tradition that every musical-comedy
heroine must be chased over the. map of
Europe before she makes the inevitable
shuddering surrender to her young man re-
veals the entertainment as a poor relation
of several brighter things that have gone
before. Three acts are devoted to the reitera-
tion of other familiar motifs, the most
notable whereof is the revival of the aristo-
cratic spieler-type who tracks the leading
lady with classic indecorum, while maintain-
ing loud attachments in the demi-monde.
However, this swindler, the Baron Montalba,
does not transpire until Act 11., by which
time the heroine is in the throes of her in-
fatuation for her aviator lover, and only has
an impatient ear and cold eye for the Baron’s
pointed speeches and rolled-gold goods.
Between the entrance and exit of the Baron
the story has a dim suggestion of a plot,
but elsewhere it is mostly an aggravating
discourse on the tender passion, carried on
in the banal jargon of musical comedy and
never sounding as if it matters. Also there
are some occasional remarks anent a lottery
ticket that flutters unaccountably from hand
to hand and wins a prize of £20,000, but
these brief references are never permitted
to disturb the general scheme of canoodle.

Musically “The Dancing Mistress” doesn’t
amount to a feast, but it provides some
opportunities for Miss Maggie Dickinson,
Miss Cadman, Derek Hudson and others.
Miss Dickinson is cast for the name part;
but Maggie’s pleasant little pipe can’t yet
rise to the demands of several exacting
songs. Nor is she yet able to assume the
witchery of the charmer who is supposed to
drive Leslie Holland dotty. Frankly, Miss
Dickinson never gets there, except with her
feet; and her talent for dressing will fill
many of her worshippers with gloom. Miss
Ethel Cadman figures as the sport of Lord
Lyndale’s fancy, the said Lord being a rough
etching by the heavy hand of Reginald
Roberts. As Teddy Cavanagh, the airman,
Leslie Holland shows himself a virtuoso in
the raptures of calf love; and as the bad
and busy Baron Montalba Derek Hudson is
a very tame apology for a fuss. A minor
adventurer by C. R. Bantock is stodgy in
repose and strained in action; Albert is a
satisfactory pub proprietor, and John Ral-
ston an unimportant feature as banker
Rosenblum. Minnie Love has a real nicht
oot wi’ th’ character o’ Jeanie McTavish,
and Phil Smith has spasms of fretful fooling
as the betting butler Widdicombe. This
Mr. Widdicombe is the head servant
in Miss Pindrop’s Academy for Young
Ladies, and his lessons in the gentle art of
punting are some of the surreptitious “ex-
tras” in a liberal education. Miss Ethel
Morrison appears as the stern and proper
principal of the college, wherein Maggie
Moore lectures on French history.

At Melbourne Princess’s the friends of
Virtue are doing their best to bring the
villain into well-deserved contempt. He is
a miscreant of the military sort and a liar
of the very dirtiest water. His persistent
derry on George Cross accounts for George
being expelled from the Australian forces,
but he rejoins “Our Boys of the Darda-
nelles” and is deputed to explode a Turkish
ammunition magazine which goes off in
three little bursts of fireworks, leaving
George without a stain on his character.
Considered as a war drama “0.8.0.T.D.” is
a rough-and-ready arrangement, but as an
incentive to recruiting it suits the times.
Life on the hills of Gallipoli is a khaki-clad

A topical story of bother in the Balkans is
being told in “The Unafraid,” the big four-
part feature at Hoyt’s Melbourne theatres
this week. Rita Jolivet, an English actress,
strikes many becoming attitudes as the lead-
ing lady of the disturbance. Clara Kimball
Young, Unc. Sam’s most celebrated film
actress on a popularity vote, plays the prin-
cipal character in Hoyt’s occult phantasy
entitled “Lola.” Clara simulates the agony
of a deceased damsel who parts with her
soul in a miraculous resurrection, and all
the time she is on the screen she gives imag-
inative people some creepy moments. At
Olympia next Saturday Hoyt’s tell the story
of the battle in Cuba where General Jack
Johnson got his ticket for St. Helena.

A TOILET HINT.
Ladies who suffer from pale, sallow, bad
complexions, yet who quite naturally object
to the “loud,” coarse, and “made-up” appear-
ance almost inevitably associated with the
use of rouge—which also, by the way, is
often distinctly harmful to the complexion—
will be interested to learn that they can
easily regain the velvety, child-like freshness
of their complexions by using a simple, in-
expensive lotion composed of 2oz. of rose
water, 1 dram tincture of benzoin, and 2oz.
of flowers of oxzoin. Shake well befor-
applying with a soft cloth or sponge. When
dry brush lightly with a soft cloth or a piece
of chamois leather. If you will do this
whenever you go out you will always have
a soft, natural, refined color, of which your
friends cannot be suspicious, and of which
you need not be ashamed. This lotion is
also exceptionally beneficial in relieving
and preventing chapped faces and hands, as
well as redness due to exposure to weather.*

Wirths’ Greatest Show on Earth hit Mel-
bourne again on Saturday night, newly
furbished and redolent of new sensations.
For instance, Captain Lindo’s performing
lions and bears —so new that Lindo wiped
buckets of sweat from his worried brow
when the turn terminated successfully. The
six (or eight) pale tan lions, being young
and fresh, offer some hope of a gory acci-
dent to the tamer. The hope may be delu-
sive, but it counts. Maximo —a Drunk on
the Wire —is a joyous sight. Regulation
evening bags, squashed top hat and bottle —
everything was there but the crayfish. The
staggering Maximo has not even the support
of a lamp-post at each end, and the house
sees _ nothing but a wire which goes into
nothingness. Captain Frank Hulings has a
likeable lot of seals and sea-lions, which
work all the tricks of an expert juggler.
Big Papa Lion tried a header into the
house on Saturday night, and it took half a
dozen attendants to persuade him to go
home to the missus and forgive her just this
once. The front row took it in much better
part when the plump lady trick-rider
bounced off her milk-white steed into the
combined laps of three khaki soldiers in the
second row. She became an embarrassed
mass of red spangles and blushes, and made
goo-goo eyes at the fieldsmen for the rest of
the turn. Some Russian acrobatkins,
caught very young, gambol on a gold tra-
peze ; a gentleman walks on pins and knives
a.nd broken bottles; and a padded Sandow
lifts iron weights made of rubber and bends
iron bars made of garden hose. In fact,
the Circus has all that seems necessary to
e P in good financial health during the
Melbourne season; nevertheless, some extra
eouestrian thrills are promised for Saturday
next.

“Jean Sibi,’**at a show of art, etc.:—
The portrait of John Forrest, painted by the
late Phillips Fox, is the biggest effort in the show
of the Australian Art Association at Melbourne
Athenaeum. All Bigjohn’s pride in his millinery as
Knight and Privy Councillor is subtly depicted in
a likeness that goes beyond the dead etiquette of
official portraiture. Technically the work is excel-
lent, but the overpowering glitter of the official
millinery gives the canvas the ornate fatuity of an
illuminated address. Fox has a couple of other
portraits in another part of the hall, and elsewhere
his widow (Miss Ethel Carrick) is represented by
her usual prismatic painting. Ambrose Patterson’s
talent rages for expression in 21 subjects, whereof
the smaller are the more significant, and Penleigh
Boyd throws himself prostrate before some of
Nature’s nicest recipes for spring and summer
weather. Miss Cumbrae Stewart’s half-draped
heroines would turn a monk from the path of duty,
and the only fault to find with Leslie Wilkie’s
“Sisters” is that they are rather cool and inanimate,
and need to live in an embracing atmosphere. The
two McCubbins, Fred and Louis, send their usual
swag of canvases. Papa is still devoted to grassy
foregrounds and interlacing trees, and in some of
his effusions you cannot see the paint for scenery.
Son Louis affects a wider range. He favors any-
thing from quarries by moonlight to richly deco-
rated interiors, and everywhere reveals a delicate taste
in color values. McClintock and Mather, water-
colorists, Cheerfully endeavor to make their sort of
landscape fashionable; Mrs. Southern has one or two
slight misadventures in the country; while Edward
Officer almost exhausts the resources of his color
box in half a dozen well-selected views.

One of the most brilliant of the Adelaide
Repertory pldyers, Douglas Walsh, was
farewelled, before going to war, at a Queen s
Hall evening of four plays and a little good
music. Walsh, appeared in all four, but left
the fat parts to others. Even the two
selected Schnitzl-er playlets deal with an
apologetic and nervous Anatol, engaged in
trying to get rid of a girl instead of annex-
ing one; so Walsh did not show as the
breezy leading-juvenile type in which he
excels. Wilfrid Neill, on the other hand,
was at his best as the Cockney youth in
“Augustus,” quite concealing his identity, a
rare thing with him ; and Ray Walsh scored
heavily all through, as the night-watchman
and Anatol’s friend Max, The ladies were
not less good: Ivy Stacey as the greedy
ballet-dancer Mimi, and Beryl Cook as the
stormy Lona, who smashed Anatol’s crockery
so realistically that the fragments shelled
an eminent K.C. in the stalls. Also Dorothy
Leigh scored well in a new piece, Morgan’s
“Search Me,” a simple story of a French
actress bluffing a Yankee customs man.
There was real art in the way in which the
lady, while preserving perfect decorum, con-
veyed the impression each moment that most
of her clothing was about to fall off. It is
a brilliant band of players; may Lieut.
Walsh return to it safely in due time!
The well-known fact that man —including
woman—is but a grown-up kid received one
more proof on Eight Hours day in Adelaide,
when the main attraction for 20,000 people
was seeing two tramcars collide head-on.
The idea was a distant imitation of an
American locomotive smash; but these were
merely long-abandoned horse-cars, hauled to
a height and allowed to run at each other
switchback fashion. The chief effect was a
surprise, some genius having thought of put-
ting a blow-lamp and a stock of petrol on
each car, so that instantly flames leapt 30
feet into the air, and ongr a little tangled
ironwork remained. Then-the crowd, child-
like, was glad it had come. ‘

ance as the priest in “The Rosary,” and the
season is being extended; also business is
big at the King’s, with the same co. that
has already earned praise. Edward Reeves
gave a good recital on “Anzac” evening,
and at the Tivoli Elwyn Harvey, as “A
Woman Adrift,” saves Roland Conway’s life
at the eleventh hour —actually about 10.30.

“Rosna,’ ? between Zeps.
The 3rd London General Hospital, where hundreds
of Tommy Kangaroos and Atkinses are being re-
paired, has a unique art show this week, the work
of 26 well-known painters who have thrown down
tools till the end of the war and taken on hospital
and other war-work. Australian names in the list
are Lance-Corporal George Coates, Privates Streeton,
A. H. Fullwood and Tom Roberts. Best known of
the English contingent is Sergeant Derwent Wood,
R.A., the sculptor, who has been found wonderfully
useful in getting plaster casts of injured limbs for
splint-making purposes. The crowd altogether has
provided a notable little show of 133 exhibits.
It makes a bright change for the convalescents from
the stereotyped hospital concert.
Brilliant N.S.W. Attorney-General Hall
floundered further into the bog last week.
At Bathurst he admitted that price-fixing
experiments were dangerous, and that the
thing had better be left alone under normal
conditions and only practised during drought
and the like. In other words, when the
farmer has a good harvest and prices are
consequently low, the market need not be
“controlled”; but when the farmer strips
only three or four bushels to the acre, prices
ought to be fixed so that they will still be
low. As a scheme for l’ooking the farmer
and warning people off the land in N. S.
Wales, nothing could be more perfect.

“P.X.” on another new industry:—
Re the manufacture of searchlight carbons in
Maoriland (B. 14/10/’l5). I’m sure The Bulletin
will be glad to know that the same thing is being
done in Australia. As soon as the war started and
the German supply was cut off, Capt. G. B. Clerk
and Corporal Norton, of the 33rd Fortress Co. (En-
gineers), got to work in Sydney and designed a
plant to produce the goods. Both Clerk and
Norton are Australian-born engineers, in the service
of the Standard-Waygood Co. when not on military
duty, and the goods produced under their direction
by that co. at Pyrmont have been giving entire
satisfaction. The first carbons they produced were
made nearly a year ago, and for a long time now
nothing else has been used in the searchlights, which
haven’t once failed, though they have been running
400 nights. By way of a joke—though there was
some annoyance attached to it—most of the Fortress
Engineers, who have been on duty since the day war
was declared, were lately favored by Mr. Holman
with a circular appealing to them to enlist 1
AT POVERTY POINT.
“Norbell”: Exit Charles Percival St. John
Smith, who has been running the Empire
Theatre, Brisbane, since the death of his
partner Ted Holland a year ago. Dapper
little Percy St. John, with a flower in his
buttonhole and a twinkle in his eye for
every pretty ballerina, has been identified
with the managerial end of vaudeville, pan-
tomime, etc., in Australia for 30 years, his
first splash being with a show of his own
ia Melbourne in 1885. After that he toured
in conjunction with Slade Murray, and in
1894 he hitched on with Delohery, Craydon
and Holland. His activities have been
mostly in Bananaland of late years. He
was at work up to the end, which was
clocked at 56 years.
“Kaniva”: Constable David Edward
McGrath, who was shot by armed burglars
at the Melbourne Trades Hall recently, was
some 20 years back running Vaudeville
shows in Victoria with the late Tom Forde,
the well-known theatrical costumibre. The
end of both was sudden and tragic, as Forde
was run down by a motor-car and killed.
“K.”: Eleanor Carey, an Australian
actress well remembered by the old school,
lately died at the Mount Vernon Hospital,
New York City. Her first appearance was
at the Haymarket Theatre (Vic.) on Novem-
ber 3, ’66, as “Apollo in Paris,” a burlesque.
Miss Carey rose very rapidly in her profes-
sion, and soon was in the first class. Her
Mercy Merrick in the “New Magdalen,”
with Dampier as the Rev. Julian Gray, made
a great impression. When the old Theatre
Royal was destroyed by fire in March, 1872,
the co. used St. George’s Hall, where various
of Robertson’s plays were staged, and as
Naomi Tighe, in “School,” with Harry Sef-
ton as Krux the sneaking Usher, Miss Carey
was invincible. In 1877 she left for America
and was benefited and presented with a
testimonial which was handed to her by
H. R. Harwood. Miss Carey married in
America, but still followed the stage.
“E.N.M.” on a matter of imported noise:
Apparently on the recommendation of the im-
ported foreigner at the head of the Sydney Con-
stablerium, it is to be left to the decision of Arthur
Griffith, ex-Minister for Public Waste—-I mean,
Works—whether or not the “Continental pitch” shall
replace the existing “pitch” of our band instruments.
From the Telegraph I learn that “the news this
week of principal interest in connection with the
Conservatorium is the resolution to obtain a com-
plete set of wind instruments, brass and wood, for
orchestral use at the low pitch.” Needless to say, if
Griffith approves the resolution—and the D.T. man
seems cocksure that he will—the new instruments
will have to .be imported, and will assuredly figure
in some forthcoming lOU estimate as “permanent
and reproductive works,” just as the carpets and
crockery of the Jenolan Caves rest house did
many years ago. But, further, a musical revolution
will have begun; and I can, perhaps, give some idea
of what the change will mean. In 1892 I hap-
pened to be in Portsmouth when the French Channel
Fleet visited that wonderful port, to be reviewed by
Queen Victoria and have a good time generally.
Portsmouth was the headquarters of the Royal Marine
Light Infantry, and the R.M.L.I. band was (and I
believe still is) something to boast of. The French sent
over the famous Garde band. At one of the junket-
ings, a concert in the rotunda of Southsea Pier, this
Garde band and the R.M.L.I. band played in friendly
competition. The R.M.L.I. led off with the overture
to Von Suppe’s “Poet and Peasant,” and gave a re-
markably fine rendering—so much so that the chival-
rous Gardes themselves applauded like one o’clock.
Then came the French bandsmen’s turn, and for the
first time I heard the “Marseillaise” played as only
a first-class French military band can play it. But,
oh! the difference in tone! The brilliance, the
color, the richness of the R.M.L.I. instru-
ments were all missing in the French band’s per-
formance —magnificent as it was in all respects save
sound. After the English “pitch” the “Continental
pitch” is dull and tuneless, as that exceptional
opportunity of contrasting the two proved conclu-
sively.
“Melb”: J. C. Williamson, Ltd., builds its
Bourke-street Picture Theatre at the Royal-
lane corner, opposite the Theatre Royal, Mel-
bourne. Legal sanction has just been obtained
to vary a trifling obstacle in the will of G.
W. Petty. It limited leasing to seven years;
but the Williamson co. obtains a lease for 20
years. The present rental is £1777 a year
for two shops on Bourke-street and several
warehouses up the lane. The Williamson
people pay £2500 a year for the first 10
years, £2750 for the following five, and £3OOO
for the last five. They undertake to spend
not less than £6500 in building, under the
name of the Electric Theatres Proprietary,
with £25,000 capital, of which £15.000 is
paid up. Principal shareholders: Tallis and
the Williamson estate. Meanwhile deep and
broad foundations are dug for the new Em-
pire Theatre, Bourke-street East. Surely
that street will be well enough furnished
with nine picture theatres going every night:
Britannia,' Electric, Empire, Gaiety, Hoyt’s,
Melba, National, Star and Victoria. In other
parts West’s, the Majestic and Olympia are
open nightly, and the Glaciarium and Snow-
den will re-open for the summer. Total, 14 in
Melbourne city every night, with pictures
also shown in the Auditorium, Guild Hall
and Masonic Hall.
“0.K.”: I am not struck on the cold,
unbending mannerisms of Charles Millward’s
acting, though they served very well in
“Bought and Paid For.” Millward appar-
ently belongs to the school of suppressed-
emotion mumming, whereof the late
Cuyler Hastings was Australia’s first
example. He reminds one of Hastings with-
out suggesting the rich tones of that man’s
voice. And Cuyler Hastings, who came here
to play Sherlock Holmes, was understood to
be an imitator of Gillette, the original Sher-
lock. In fact, he was said to have studied
his model in the capacity of “dresser” —but
that may have been a spiteful fabrication.
Anyway, Millward has the Gillette method
if Hastings had it. He gets his effects by
holding his head high and his figure stiff.
This rigidity calls for the expression of a
lot of feeling in the voice, and Millward
hasn’t the fine, sonorous organ that made
Cuyler Hastings memorable in some of his
lines.
“New York”: I disagree with the “Sundry
Show” notice of “Playing the Game” (B.
7/10/’l5). Except for the bad first act, it
seems to me to be a well-knit, well-con-
structed play, and as sincere as the other
critic says it isn’t. I think the last three acts,
on the whole, well played. Bailey gets into
a new line and handles it excellently, and
Agnes Keogh’s part doesn’t call for “breadth
of melodramatic style.” The statement “that
American pride is going cheap since the
war started,” is no more relevant than it is
true. _ The U.S. exist for the U.S., not for
Britain ; and but for American munitions and
steel exchanged for European gold, the war
\yould be all over—and all over the wrong
way for civilisation.
Poet and artist Hugh McCrae, who did
some stage work in Amurka in Granville
Barker’s production of “Androcles and the
Lion,” is making an appearance in the
Repertory show at the Melbourne Athenaeum
next Saturday night. The tall genius has
been engaged to voice the aestheticism of a
connoisseur, Sir Hubert Innes, in Eden
Phillpotts’s interesting one-act “Hiatus.”
One of the things for which the war is
responsible is the settling in Sydney of
Alexander Y. Laushman as a teacher of
dancing. Laushman came to Australia with
Gen6e as second dancer (Volinin being prin-
cipal), and then remained here, first with
the “Forty Thieves” pantomime and after-
wards with the Royal Comics. He is a
Russian, and the training he received at
home for his job was of the strenuous order.
Eight hours a day for nine years is his esti-
mate of the time he put in at it.
“Harrison O.”: Encouraged doubtless by
the success of Dorothy Brunton, the Firm in
its production of “The Dancing Mistress”
at Melbourne _ Majesty’s. gives _ another
young Australian —Maggie Dickinson —a
chance in a leading part. For some years
Maggie has been known as the cleverest local
coryphee, but it was not until the last
panto., in which she sang the chorus of a
sentimental ditty, that the public was per-
mitted to learn that she also has a voice.
Since then she has been tried in a couple
of minor parts, and handled even a con-
spicuous misfit with an ability worthy of a
better cause. Now, though one of the young-
est leading ladies seen on the Australian
musical-comedy stage for some years, she
acts, sings and dances charmingly, with a
confidence in no way akin to bumptiousness.
She has still a great deal to learn about
singing, but the voice is there, and, with
the exception of Flo Young’s, her enuncia-
tion is clearer than that of any contempo-
rary. Maggie is not afraid of hard work,
and if she sets herself resolutely to ignore
the methods of about 90 per cent, of her
imported sisters she should travel a long
way in the right direction.
Tom Pollard, of Pollard’s Lilliputians,
and, when they grew up, Pollard’s Opera
Co., has just produced “Les Cloches de
Corneville” for the Wellington (M.L.)
amateurs. The first time the veteran was
busy with the opera in Wellington was 34
years ago in the old Theatre. Royal, which,
incidentally, is being converted into a police
station. What a scatter of talent there’s
been from under his wing since then!
The most surprised man in Ballarat last
Saturday was Corpl. W. Dunstan, who had
just got home, invalided from the Darda-
nelles, when he learned that he had been
awarded the Y.C. But even his parents
can’t get from him any tale of what he did,
and the topic is now taboo in the family
circle. When a local pressman called in
the evening intent on an interview the. war-
rior bolted from the house, and at a public
reception in his honor he expressed the con-
viction that he was going to faint, and had
to be forcibly restrained by the Mayor from
bolting home. He is only 20, and before
going to war had been in a local glad-rags
shop.

value as a hair grower and destroyer of the
dandruff germ that they are authorised by
the proprietors to return the money to any
purchaser who is dissatisfied with the results
after the use of a full bottle. This new
tonic is called “Lavona Hair Tonic,” and
our readers will readily understand the
secret of its success when they learn that it
is made from the world-famous formula of
3oz. Bay Rum, loz. Lavona de Composee,
and i dram Menthol Crystals. If you suffer
from falling hair, baldness, dandruff, an
itching scalp, dry, brittle or dull hair you
should at once purchase a bottle from your
nearest chemist, a man whom you person-
ally know, and whom you can trust to live
up to his guarantee without question. The
price is 4s. for a large bottle, and he will

A jovial leg puller, cattle-man Connor, had
a great time while the Westralian Leg.

provision of the new Licensing Bill. In the

of shouting; wherefore he proposed to in-
clude in the prohibitory clause the sinful
pastimes known as “Selling a horse,’ "lam-
ba-roora,” “A Bob In.” “Murrumbidgee,”
“Cork Loo,” and “A Potter Hand.” This
virtuous suggestion having been blown out
by the chairman. Connor followed on with a
resolution to bar shouting in the Parlia-
ment refresliery, and the joke so tickled lion,

Then the awful realisation of what its fri-
volity had run it up against hit the Cham-
ber iike a bomb; the Bill was hurriedly re-
committed, and the amendment struck out on
the riclily-humorous ground that "it made
the House look ridiculous,” though nobody
explained why it is more ridiculous to stop
Connor from shouting in the Parliamentary
refreshment-room than in a pub at the back
of Godbelpus.

Sydney’s model suburb constructed out

now officially referred to as Stannumvdie,
but is still generally known as Calico Alley.
The calico lias, however, been replaced b.v
galvanised iron; and as this' has been done
in nice time for summer, the locality will
henceforward be known as the Camp Oven.

“Bumpkin,” from the vasty deep :
X. S. Wales Marine Court has found fault with
tlie skipper of the coaster Yuloo for banging into
the ketch Wave off Barranjoey one day last month.
The ketch was full of dynamite, and was flopping
about without steerage way when the Yuloo mis-
behaved. Luckily, the dynamite was not exploded,
or everything in the vicinity, including Father Nep-
tune’s whiskers, would have been blown to glory.
The only damage was the loss of the ketch’s for’ard
gear. There was some doubt in the Court’s mind as
to whether the sailer’s lights were visible, but there
was no doubt at all that the master of the Yuloo
had not kept an adequate look-out. Collisions
between colliers and ketches on the Newcastle and
Sydney track have been fairly common, and on at
least two occasions have resulted in loss of life. The
steamer is always held to blame, the rule of the
road casting on her the duty of keeping out of the
way of a sailing ship. Which brings us back to the
question of look-out. The N.S.W. Wales Marine Act
doesn’t lay down a manning scale, and the master
of the Yuloo explained that he had not sufficient
seamen to maintain a constant look-out. The Court
remarked that this wasn’t its business. The Law
required that a look-out be kept, wherefore a look-
out must be kept. Which is no doubt true, but
how is it going to be done unless a manning scale
is insisted upon? Does anybody know when Aus-
tralia’s Navigation Act, which does provide for pro-
per manning, is likely to commence business?
* * * *
“Brumby”: It happened at a wedding-
breakfast in Sydney. For a couple of hours
prior to and during the gorge one of the
Waitresses had acted as a sort of special
attachee on the behests of the bejewelled
mother-in-law. At its conclusion she asked
the girl to pack up the uneatpn portions of
kosher-fish, etc., and put them in the baskets
they were brought in, adding “I won’t for-
get you.” This done she called the weary
damsel before her. “Now, you girls have
worked very well to-night.” she remarked,
“How many of you are there?” The girl
brightened, and furtively counted up on
her fingers. “Well, now,” said the dame
grandly, “I am very pleased with you all,
and I am going to give you each a nice
piece of fish.”
THE FLATTERER.
“Bless me, Maud, you look quite fascinating this morning!”
“Go lion with you, Mister Boggs—yeh don't catch me with your white-slave talk!”
There is nothing like taking a threatened
danger seriously. Recent press reports
state that a “large party of men and youths
have searched the Haunted Hills, near Mor-
well (Vic.), for the tiger which a resident
reported having seen there a few days be-
fore. The animal, however, was not seen,
and the searchers returned empty-handed.”
This paper hates to see energy wasted, and
suggests that a search by these armed men
and youths on certain hills overlooking the
Dardanelles mignt yield better results.
* * * *
The stress of war and of knitting socks
has made little alteration in the mysterious
ways of woman. The case of Melbourne’s
Missing Girl, who after more than two
months’ absence still continues missing,
speedily evoked cheap imitations. The first
was a damsel, an “attractive-looking, well-
developed girl of 15,” who remained lost for
a few days while the police sought for clues,
and was then casually met in the street by
her father. Another case was that of a Fitz-
roy child. She was given half a crown and
sent to buy groceries, and so far neither she
nor the groceries nor the half-dollar have
returned. The police are looking for a clue
here, too, but with little enthusiasm: they
reckon she will soon get tired of disappear-
ing when she observes that she is causing no
sensation.

.T. M. Prentice, from the Sharia el
Manakh :—-
Cairo is essentially a feminine city, and the subtle
suggestion of its sex abounds everywhere. She is
a lady, though, whose disregard for personal clean-
liness is disguised by much perfume; the sights and
sounds that make her a delight to new eyes are too
often suddenly marred by the horror of some unex-
pected revelation.
The heart of the city is a slightly irregular tri-
angle, bounded by three streets, of which Sharia
Nubar Pasha and Sharia Abbas are the sides and
Sharia el Ivubri is the base. A wonderful heart for
a great city, wherein are gathered samples of prac-
tically every race. Yesterday in my own sharia I
counted 39 distinct racial types— : and practically
every signboard and show-window bears inscriptions
in five languages.
Yet Cairo is not prosperous, and everywhere the
ominous sign “a louer” is evidence of unoccupied
buildings. The lack of tourist wealth pouring into
the city is largely responsible for the increasing
squalor and dirtiness of the Harets and Minans, the
mean streets of the poorer quarters. There are fine
hotels —Shepherd's and the Continental as examples
—but they are drawing their diminished revenue
from the officers of the A.I.F. and the comparatively
few wealthy Egyptians who ape English manners and
Continental life. Of course the Wazaar, the street
of prostitution, is busy—the wares so openly ped-
dled, and in such plentitude, that even the moder-
ately moral man is horrified. The restaurants still
please. Meals are exquisitely cooked and served
for from , six to 10 piastres, from Is. 3d. to 2s. A
typical menu is: Consomme; omelette ; fried chicken
with potatoes; sweets, fruit, and cafe noir—all for
eight piastres = Is. Bd.
But every day Cairo becomes more and more a
city of ghosts.. The Australians who are here are
all here for one purpose. Everyone has a friend, a
relative or a brother dead in Gallipoli, in Lemnos,
in. Malta, in England.' And everywhere we go we
see the places where our friends were. Their foot-
falls, in a ghostly cadence, join with ours in the
hot street. We are not alone when we drink the
Belgian beer of the cafe bar, ordered in French
from a Greek waiter —their memories are very con-
stantly with us.. So we grow daily to hate this great,
wonderful city, whose . novelty has given place to
weariness, and the call of surf or of the blue gums
of the ranges is constantly in our ears.

The prohibition of tipping by the M.L.
Arbitration Court has been followed by
action amongst the marine stewards in Aus-
tralia, who previously tried and failed to
get the local Court to decline to recognise
the tip as an offset to wages. They say
that the M.L. award has had the effect of
causing people to entertain the idea that the
veto prevails in Australia; wherefore they
claim that the wages are now inadequate: On
the absurd principle that the Federal Arbi-
tration Court cannot interfere in any matter
until it sees a stout and a lean party in
holts about it, at least a pretence of a
tight has to be made before the legal machin-
ery can be set going; and, the Federated
Marine Stewards’ Union having made the
requisite noise on the doorstep of the Court,
conferences have been summoned as a pre-
liminary. Meantime the Maoriland travel-
ler alleges that he can’t notice any differ-
ence—the steward’s hand seems to be in just
the same old place.

Stock-inspector’s evidence in a police-court
case at Singleton (N.S.W.) last week: —
lie saw the four bullocks at Singleton saleyard.
Three were emaciated, their eyes were sunken, and the
beasts were coughing. The fourth was in little better
condition, but had a large lump on the body. Wit-
ness condemned the four. One had tuberculosis of
the lungs and liver, another had tuberculosis of the
throat as well as the lungs and liver, and the third
showed the same symptoms. The fourth was dis-
eased.
The Law x lifted its ears and said that the
penalty for offering these packets of disease
would be £5 per head and costs, and even
then it seemed surprised at its own ferocity.
Yet for stealing a tin of baking-powder,
which was a mere joke by comparison, a
man up in the same district has got as much
as four years’ gaol!
THE CHURCH BELLS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The Viennese authorities have melted down the
great bell in St. Stephen’s to supply metal for guns
or munitions. Every poor village has made a similar
gift.—Lokal Anzeiqeh.
't he great bell booms across the town,
Reverberant and slow,
And drifting from their houses down
The calm-eyed people go.
Their feet fall on the portal stones
Their fathers’ fathers trod :
And still the bell, with reverent tones,
From cottage nooks and purple thrones
Is calling souls to God.
The chapel bells with ardor spake
Above the poplars tall,
And perfumed Sabbath seemed to wake.
Responsive to their call
From dappled vale and green hillside
And nestling village hives
The peasants came in simple pride
To hear how their Lord Jesus died
To sweeten all their lives.
They boom beyond the battered town;
The hills are belching smoke;
And valleys charred and ranges brown
Are quaking ’neath the stroke.
The iron roar to Heaven swells,
And domes and steeples nod;
Through cities vast and ferny dells
And village streets the clamant bells
Are calling souls to God !

“Aloysius’s” yarn from the Front: —
A supply depot is far from being a model grocery
store. There is not always time nor space to
arrange things in a neat; and orderly fashion. The
usual run of them have a barricade of boxes of
bully beef and war rations to keep swaddies and
shells from wandering all over the place. Inside is
a- heterogeneous collection of clothing, picks and
-hovels, cases of jam and ammunition, tobacco,
A.S.C. men, bombs, biscuits, rifle-oil and other
articles necessary for the maintenance and equip-
ment of troops in the field. My mate had been on
gmh'd at one supply depot, and the sight of so
many good things within easy reach so fired his
imagination that lie informed me of his intention
of supplementing our larder at the expense of the
A.S.C. the first opportunity that offered. Army rations
are designed on a fairly liberal scale as far as the
average appetite is concerned, but apart from the
fact that my mate and I take an out-size in appe-
tites, an extra tin or so of jam or tobacco comes
in,handy to any man. So the next time my mate
struck A.S.C. fatigue he departed with evil designs
on the stores and my blessing. He returned some
time a.rii. and said he had scored three tins of
jam, though what kind he did not know. I struck
a match to ascertain for myself, and observed some-
thing- strange in the shape of the bottom of the
tins. 1 went to hold the match closer, when my
mate gave an unearthly yell and put it out. “Keep
that blanky light away,” he roared. “It’s a bomb!”
Steve held the floor for the space of a quarter of
an hour and criticised his luck in vile French,
worse. Egyptian and deplorable English until a
lance-corporal a few dug-outs away censored his
discourse. Next morning the corporal was puzzled
at the presence of three canister bombs in his dug-
out—but not half as puzzled as the officer to whom
he tried to explain the circumstance. Moral for
recruities: Never break the Eighth Commandment in
the dark.

Kite’s gentle tones. “Gow to the war!”—
still more exaggerated burlesque. “Oh. ’e’d

From “The Oldest Inhabitant” :
The Randwiclc Orphanage, which has been com-
mandeered by the Defence Department for the use of
wounded soldiers, had its genesis in 1852. In February
of that year Dr. Henry Grattan Douglas got some
sympathetic friends together at his house in Castle-
reagh-street, Sydney, “to consider the best means of
providing for the orphans of the city.’’ Manji fathers
had cleared out for the diggings, and had left their
responsibilities behind. A committee was formed
consisting of George Allen, T. Cowlishaw, J. Comrie,
A. C. G. Owen, .1. McLerie, Archdeacon McEncroe and
Dr. Douglass. The Rev. A. H. Stephen, eldest son
of Chief Justice Alfred Stephen, was hon. sec. ; Dr.
Alexander Cuthill was first medical officer. Two
years after his appointment Dr. Cuthill was shot by
a madman while driving in his gig on Cook’s River-
road. He left £12,000 for the relief of destitute
children, and it was with this sum that the asylum
at Randwiclc was built. In February, 1857, the
society was incorporated, and in March, 1858, the
asylum was opened and the children removed from
Ormonde House —erstwhile Cooper’s Juniper Hall —•
Paddington, and other places. Dr. Cuthill’s was not
the only large donation to the funds. Boards in the
entrance hall record donations from £5O upwards.'
Amongst the earliest was £BOO raised by Catherine
Hayes at a concert given by her when in Sydney
in 1854-55. The prices were £l, 155., 10s. and
gallery ss. ; the old Victoria Theatre the scene. This
sum, increased by generous gifts, was used for the
erection in 1870 of the Catherine Hayes Hospital in
the grounds of the Asylum. And Mrs. Mary Roberts
—a daughter of Dr. Lang’s historic friend and credi-
tor, “Jeannie Muckle” —left it £22,478.
“Kismet” joints the chorus :
Can nothing be done to improve the mail service
to and from the Front? By the last delivery I got
four letters from my husband, and although there
was a month’s difference in the dates of the first and
--last, they apparently arrived in Australia by the
same ship. My soldier, a staff officer, has been in
Egypt, at the same station, since July; and though
I have written every Sunday since the troopship left
Sydney, and sometimes between whiles, and though,
to make quite sure, I’ve posted the letters myself
every Monday morning at the G.P.0., addressed
according to the regulations, he moved on for the
Front without receiving a single letter from me.
Certainly my cables have reached him; but cables
are too expensive a luxury, more than once in a
while, for a soldier’s wife. It is now 12 months
since our first troops went forward: surely in that
time the most dilatory department in any admini-
stration should have been able to organise so im-
portant a matter as the communications between the
men who go to fight and the women who wait witli
fearful heart. If the army’s mail service is any
criterion of its general service, what sort of a mess
are things in!
“We have to admit that rascals sometimes

A man who broke down twice in a big
military camp, and was then pronounced
medically unfit, showed remarkable energy in
getting out after a pension. It was then
found that he was 55, and the applicant was

self with something from the old-age fund.
How do these veterans get there V So many

in the ranks that the authorities begin to sus-
pect that there must exist a wholesale system
of impersonation.
A church at Narrabri (N.S.W.) has lost
the chance of its life. In June, T 4, W. 11.
Evans, of those parts, decided to take a
trip to the Cold Country, and as lie had
for some years raised a sturdy baritone
every Sunday in the Anglican choir, the
conventicle gave him a send-off at which a
leather pocket wallet was handed to him.
Just as he reached England he heard that
Rill the Bloodstained was murdering babies
in Belgium ; and Evans went across with an
English territorial regiment to tell Bill that
he mustn’t. In Flanders he stopped six
fragments of shrapnel, one of which would
have found his heart if the leather wallet
had not neatly intercepted it. From hos-
pital at Lincoln (Eng.) lie sends his Nar-
rabri friends a photo, of the damaged purse
as evidence of his story. Now, if the church-
had only given him a Bible!
“The Pole”: I saw a fine body of men in
clay-colored pyjamas just now. A very fat
man in very loose pyjamas was standing on
his toes and shrieking “The company will
retire! Go-o-od ni-ght!” Immediately the
two lines wheeled about and walked off
across the grass with the afternoon sun
flashing on their spectacles. Then I remem-
bered that, somewhere in the morning paper,
1 had seen a small-tvpe announcement of a
rifle-club inspection. It was happening
before me. For no reason in the world I
was thinking of an aimless centipede hurry-
ing nowhere with great deliberation when 1
noticed that a purple-faced standard-bearer
was trying to drag his banner out of a tree
which had meanly swallowed it as he tried
to pass by. The colors were recaptured
after a desperate struggle; but it rather
disorganised the platypus—l mean the
platoon—he was leading. The distress
of a young lieutenant who bleated when
he tried to howl like a military wolf
was touching to witness. The dejected
staff-officer before whom the performance
was taking place happened to be in
the vicinity at the moment, and it. gave
him an excuse to paint his cane and make
70 respectable citizens very uncomfortable.
The make-believe army, being shouted at
from three quarters, sullenly beat it's feet
on the ground, made eyes right and left like
balky horses, then swept; forward and nar-
rowly escaped trampling on a child. I saw
two drifting pieces of white paper amongst
the boots, but when they flicked a little
nearer I discovered they were two white
canvas shoes occupied by a small man with
religious doubts. The second most import-
ant figure on the parade-ground was a major
with a. heavy moustache,.-a whistle and a
cane. Although lie had more “props” than
his chief, he didn’t seem t 6 know how he
was going to put in time. I don’t
see why the brave fellows who will
have to help pay for the war should expose
themselves thus to criticism; but I hope
they won’t stop doing it. I have just taken
a season ticket and my only haunting fear
is that the end of the war will mean the
finish of it all.

It was bound to come. In a down-South

exhibit of “Christmas billies” packed with—

The humble ha’penny has come into
greater vogue than ever at Melbourne and
suburban railway booking offices, as the
result of Peacock’s endeavor to squeeze a
bit extra out of the Bailway Department
these hard financial times. Fare's have been
raised on the drapery bargain-sale system.
The old 9d. return fare to Caulfield (so
popular on race-days) is now 9jd. A one-
and-elevenpenny jaunt to the confines of the
suburban radius is raised to Is. 11M1. The
Department might have made it Is. llfd. if
the necessary little brown coins were avail-
able. A system of farthing rises on the
cheaper fares may eventuate later, and
meanwhile Melbourne is finding that fami-
liarity doesn’t breed contempt as far as
the small coppers are concerned. Time was
when the average city man regarded the
chance ha’penny as a negligible quantity.
He gave it away gratis. Nowadays lie takes
two of it from his pocket to buy a’ Herald
with. , .$■

REMARKABLE WEIGHT REDUC-
TIONS REPORTED FROM THE USE
OF SEA PLANTS.
TREATMENT EXPLAINED AT
MEDICAL CONFERENCE.
Reductions of from 20 to 40 pounds of
excessive fat in a few weeks’ time, and final
reduction to normal weight of extremely
fleshy persons, were reported at a recent
medical conference, when the subject of
obesity was discussed. The remarkable
effects obtained are attributed chiefly to the
use of salith leaves taken from sea plants.
Their action completely restores the intes-
tinal organs to their natural functions, in-
creases the supply of oxygen in the blood,
and thus consumes the excessive fat. Physi-
cians present attached special significance
to the fact that by this simple vegetable
treatment strength and vigor are greatly
increased instead, of being diminished. Fur-
thermore, the skin and tissues undergo a
natural contraction while the weight is being-
reduced, so that no flabbiness ensues. The
use of toxic drugs or weakening diets were
condemned as dangerous and undesirable.
Any person suffering from obesity can

people called him ' “Honest John,’’ and made him
mayor and member of Parliament. In a harsh,
exacting Avay he was a good employer, but in politics
he did nothing except gird at opponents and rum-
mage about in holes and corners and make fierce,
unreportable speeches. His delivery was simply
awful. Ten years ago Charlie Izard walloped him
out for Wellington North, and then the solitary old
man became a back-number, and retired to a

THE THREE KINGS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The throe Scandinavian kings (Haakon of Norway,
Gustav of Sweden, and Christian of Denmark) met
recently at Malino to “discuss economic difficulties.”
Three kings have met by the Northern Sea
(And it seems the kingdoms are less by two),
And 1 wonder what the idea can be—
And, somehow or other, I wish I knew,
for one has come from my father’s land,
That used to be mighty in days of yore,
And one has come from the Danish strand,
And the three have met on the Swedish shore.
Considering Europe, the war and all,
And floating mines that liaA'e raised their ire,
Jt can hardly he only a casual call
To talk about whales by the kitchen fire.
And it scarcely could be to discuss the Crops,
And it scarcely could be to discuss the Coav ;
for “butter is normal” in Danish shops,
And fields are frozen in Norway now.
It surely can’t be to discuss a loan,
For things in Denmark arc not “behind,”
And my father's people (unlike my own)
Have never been folk of the borrowing kind.
They've a liking for work —and they work all right,
As you may have noticed in lands like these
(What though their fathers preferred to fight
For the missus and kids on the Lord's high
seas!).
It is not land-hunger (their world is wide),
Tt is certainly not on account of Fat,
Or kingly humbug or national “side” —
The Norse have never been noted for that.
AVe had an example (or I'm mistook)
In recent years, and tlic tale is prized,
of a Swedish king who raced his cook,
And none of his people were scandalised.
There wasn’t a “gate,” for he made no charge—
He wanted to.show, in a manly way,
That his legs were quick if his girth was large,
And his wind was good if his hair was grey.
And he won the race from a younger man,
Who had six yards’ start- —lest they might forget
That, though he had passed liis three-score span,
There was life in the logs of the old king yet.
He’s a happy shade in Valhalla now
(Three kingdoms are one that were always one),
And they part and foregather without a row,
And the kingly work of his race is done.
< The rhythm has gone like the Channel “chops,”
And I can't make out, so I cannot say,
What old King Karl and his kingly props
lias got to do with this rambling lay.)
Three kings have met on the Swedish shore
(Now the rival kingdoms are less by three),
And I wonder what they were meeting for,
For it seems to have something to do with me.
Hut our mines have hoisted a barque or two—•
Or (lie German mines (’t;is a similar tune),
And, somehow or other, I felt I knew
We’d hear from Norway and Denmark soon.

When the shareholders met in Auckland last
Thursday The Bulletin hopes they gave the
navy three cheers. They might even offer to
give it three beers, if beers would do it any
good. When the war started nobody knew
what would happen. The German had made
almost as much fuss about his navy as about
his army. Fortunately he hadn’t licked his
navy into such shape as he had his army;
but it took us some months to find that out.
Meantime the underwriters, not knowing
what risks they had to face, ran up the
rates. Things turned out wonderfully well
for them: the German navy failed just as
thoroughly as the German army succeeded.
The immediate result was that the marine
underwriters had to meet surprisingly few
losses, hence the remarkable spring in this
co.’s profits for the past year. There’s no
sense in now throwing bricks at this and
other cos. and calling them extortioners.
If (as might easily have happened) the
German navy had been as good as the Ger-
man army, many a marine underwriter
would have been smashed.
On the other hand, there is to be put to
the debit of the war the shrinkage in the
market value of the co.’s securities. In
this respect an insurance office is peculiarly
ill-placed. An ordinary trading co. usies
its capital and reserves in its business—the
money is represented by stock, or machinery,
or trade credits. An insurance office re-
quires no stock and no machinery beyond
a rubber stamp or so, and it hasn’t to give
any credit worth mentioning. Its capital
is really a guarantee fund, and must there-
fore be invested in marketable securities. But,
while an office like this is thus liable to
suffer pretty badly by a shrinkage in values
such as have occurred lately, the suffering is
in nine cases out of ten more nominal than
actual. Really it doesn’t matter to the co.
what the market values of its securities are
so long as it doesn’t have to sell them. The
interest actually received isn’t a penny the
less because a Government stock which
formerly was 100 is now down to 85. But,
theoretically, since a co. must assume that
its guarantee funds are liable to be called
upon, it has also to assume that it may have
to sell its securities: hence the need to keep
the securities written down. This co. has,
besides an investment fluctuation fund of
£20,000 included with the reserves, a con-
tingency fund of £20,000 which is not
included.
But. after all, the public securities which
have shrunk so much represent only a small
part of the assets. In a line or two this
shows what has been done with the money:—
Premises .. .. ..£233,565 21.3 p.c.
Mortgages 286,577 26.1 „
Deposits and cash balances .. 269,031 24.5 „
Stocks and debentures. . . . 35,624 3.3 ~
Public securities . . . . 256,659 23.5 „
Sundries, i .. .. .. 13,507 1.3 ~
Generally speaking this paper is not dis-
posed to give its heartiest blessing to an
insurance co. which has so much nailed
down in premises and mortgages. But it
cheerfully admits that the co. will score by
being soon able to charge a higher rate of in-
terest on, the bulk of its mortgage securities.
In a couple of years the co. ought to have
an income of at least £55,000 from invest-
ments. Last year it had £42,898, which is
within cooee of the total amount paid out
in dividend. In other words, practically
all the underwriting profit was available to
strengthen the funds which guarantee the
policy-holders that things will be all right
if they should call round with a claim.
The next table shows in the last line the
extraordinary effect of the war premiums
early in the year:—

The capital is £.‘>00,000; reserves £588,410;
total £888,410. That is about 104 p.c. of the
year’s premiums—which is better than the
average of the first-class British offices.
Assuming an equal income and the same
expense rate in this current year, it means
that by August 31 next the co. would have
£1,282,044 available, which is only a trifle
less than the total claims paid in the past six
years—a position which must be very
gratifying to policy-holders in these uncer-
tain times.

Note, as a most unusual tiling, that here
it is the cumulative pref. shares which get
the most sumptuous dividend, while the
ordinaries stand still at their old 10 p.c.
The allurements of these cum. pref. shares
have been referred to on previous occasions.
There has, however, been no funny business
about it. The original co. consisted of prefs.
and ordinaries. The ordinaries were mostly
issued in payment for the patent rights and
other goodwill in the business. The public,
which put up the money, not only was given
a preference, but also, as a further and
rather unusual concession, was given the
right to anything very extra that the cow
might yield in the way of cream. When the
present co. was formed the prefs. were
transformed into cumulative prefs.; the
ordinaries became second prefs.; and a new
lot of ordinaries were issued as bonus shares.
The first prefs. take a first 7 p.c.; then the
second prefs. take 9 p.c. ; then ordinaries
take 10 p.c. ; finally first prefs. can top off on
whatever is left. The extraordinarily rapid
growth of the reserves show that there
has been a great deal left—so much that
this year the first prefs. get 121 p.c., and
even then there is nearly enough put by
to pay them another 20 p.c. if the other
shareholders were willing that they should be
greedy..
Very properly, though, the prefs.’ dividend
has not been rushed up—very properly be-
cause, though the reserves are nominally
£104,380, there is an item of £lBO,OOO among
the assets which is wholly or almost wholly
goodwill: so that over £75,000 of the present
capital of £520.000 is still unrepresented by
tangible assets. True.,-this isn’t a case
where one looks first 'of,all to see that his
principal is quite safe. lie can get very
little assurance on that point. Plant, fur-
niture and fittings, for instance, are valued
at £85,461; and if the bottom dropped out
of the business, that lot might be worth
£2s,ooo—hardly more. The same with
stocks: if some new invention arrived to
destroy the value of the Dunlop patents,
it would most likely knock large pieces oft’
the value of the stocks, now in at £305,108.
In a business of this sort you must re-
nounce the security that you can measure
up with a rule. Apart from the risks
before mentioned, the co. is very well placed.
Its liabilities are small, considering the size
and nature of the business: they total
£123,947.

Though the profits show an improvement,
the dividend has been reduced ; and that is a
good thing, because the financial position
can do with all the little helps it can get.
The co. deals chiefly in farm implements,
and the farmer usually wants terms. So it
comes about that the book debts now reach
no less than £315.712, the bulk of it being-
balances owing on time-payment sales. Three
years ago, when the co. took the concern over
from the trustees of the James Martin estate,
these hire-purchase balances totalled
£66.234. They are now up to £95,544.
As the capital is only £90,336, and as the
co. has to carry a pretty heavy stock, and
as the open accounts (apart from hire-agree-
ment balances) run to over £20,000, it fol-
lows that the -co. has had to lean pretty
hard on the money-lender. Debentures,
etc., run to s £85,312. At the time these
accounts were prepared, it was still uncer-
tain whether this year’s crops wouldn’t be
a failure: had they been, the co. would
have had to carry many a creditor
over another year, or have the goods
thrown back on its hands. In the cir-
cumstances, the directors did quite as
much as they reasonably could in paying
;> p.c. Fortunately, things seem to be now
turning out pasgtty well so far as this sea-
son’s crops are concerned. Over pretty
large areas, especially in the north and north-
west, there won’t be much better than a
failure; but in other parts there will be a
bumper harvest. The rains of a week ago
lifted a heavy load off the mind of the
machinery man, as well as a lot of other
people.
There ought to be—there must be—a fine
future stretching ahead of the Australian
farm-machinery maker. The founder of
this concern was an almost fanatical Free-
trader ; but fortunately he didn’t persuade
the country to accept his fallacies. To-day,
taught partly by the war, we know that, to
be great, we must work our iron ourselves.
Whatever else we may be foolish enough to
pass on to the foreigner, we know that we
cannot afford to pass on the manufacture of
our metal-ware. We must have furnaces
and forges, and even those who are no more
than semi-Protectionists are willing that
these industries shall be encouraged. As
for the market there is no doubt whatever.
Our farming has been little more than
begun. One of the Scotch Agricultural
Commissioners of a few years ago saw some
of our wheat. It was a tine sample. “Why
don’t you grow some?” he said. Quite a
lot of people don’t know that every year of
its life France grows three times more wheat
than all Australia grew in the most affluent
year of its life, and that Roumania and
Bulgaria, which we regard mostly as wild
bull-ant nests, each averages a larger wheat
yield than Australia.

This is another of the Maoriland co-opera-
tive cos. which ought to make Australian
farmers mad with themselves. It is now
14 years old ; and it has been content to pro-
ceed like a cautious person wffiose name is
mostly McSomething. In every three
failures of co-op. concerns one is due to the
thing falling under the sway of incompetent
people who want to rush things (which means
going heavily into debt), and two are
due to the disloyalty of the alleged co-opera-
tors. The North Otago Association cer-
tainly hasn’t rushed to destruction; and
apparently it hasn’t cause to complain of
disloyalty. Its own funds are now about
£49,000, after paying the current div. and
bonus, and its liabilities on all accounts total
£55,874. Of that lot £44,010 is fixed-deposit
money, said to practically all belong to share-
holders and to be largely fixed for five
years. On the other side there are stocks,
£34,995, and book debts, £59,776. Ascer-
tained bad debts have been charged to P. and
L. account; but besides that there has been
an annual appropriation for a bad debts re-
serve, which now, according to the directors,
amounts to £l5OO. Book debts have accord-
ingly been reduced by that amount, though
they may actually be worth more., Consider-
ing the size of the two items the liabilities
are commendably small; and the system of
finance appears to be, in general, exception-
ally prudent.
But why in the name of common-sense does
the co. spoil an otherwise good document by
lumping all its appropriations together?
The entry doesn’t even tell the truth. Every
year the whole of the appropriations, includ-
ing dividend on capital (present capital is
£37,500), rebate on stock and wool commis-
sions, bonus on shareholders’ purchases,
bonus on salaries, profits transferred to bad
debts and other reserves, are expressed as
“Dividend, bonus, income tax and chairman’s
expenses.” The auditors certify that the
statements “exhibit a true and correct view
of the state of the association’s affairs.” Do
they? Even if it is a fair thing to lump
all payments to shareholders, it is an un-
wise thing to include in the bundle pay-
ments made to officers of the co. and
provision for bad debts.

The figures for the last half-year show the
profits after writing £l5OO off plant and
meters. For 10 years to 1005 this co. paid
14 p.c. Then electric competition arrived,
and the directors awakened to the fact that,
though it was pleasant to return share-
holders’ capital every seven years, it might
be more profitable in the long run to see if
the white-ants had not got behind the bril-
liant office door-plate. Incidentally, under
competition, the co., while reducing the divi-
dend. also reduced the price of gas a trifle.
But this is the best it can show:—

Liabilities . . 812 1,288 4.273

From this point of view the co. is £3624
worse off than it was 10 years ago, when
the directors decided that it was “advisable
to strengthen the position.” During the last
few months it became advisable to spend a
few thousands on plant; and this small
outlay is responsible for spoiling the level
at which the surplus was being kept. 8. E.
Figgis, the co.’s G.-M., has retired after 47
years’ service, and secretary D. W. I >avies
takes charge. . He will have a hard job to
maintain the 12 p.c. div. and keep the co.’s
finances healthy.

The Solomon Islands Rubber Planta-
tion Co. (Brisbane). —This co. was formed
to succeed a syndicate which had taken
over Captain Svensen’s plantation land in
the Solomons. It owns between 13.000 and
14.000 acres, all or nearly all freehold. The
original capital, issued to the old syndicate,
w r as £20,000 in fully paid £1 shares; and
there are also 40,000 contribs. on which
15s. 3d. has now been paid, including 2s. 6d.
called during the past year. This has left
the co. with no debts of importance beyond
£BOOO owing on mortgage to Svensen, and
lately secured for another live years, making
the due date 1925. As usual, the co. finds
the job of planting, while holding what it
has planted, a painfully slow one. Thus
far only 015 acres have been got under
eocoanuts, and the area under rubber remains
at 112 acres; the gilt being off the rubber
gingerbread, nothing has beeu done in that
direction of late. A trifle is already being
got from copra; but obviously, with develop-
ment still in progress, it is almost impos-
sible to say what ought to be charged to
profit and loss and what to capital. The
accounts debit “crop expenses, harvesting
and making copra” at £206, while the net
proceeds of consignments were £4lO, and
store and other earnings were £402. In
management exes and interest the outgoings
were £724; and £7223 was charged to cap-
ital account, bringing up the total debited
against plantations to £58.250. The labor
difficulty has been rather less acute during
the year ; nevertheless, owing to war: uncer-
tainties, a go-slow policy is being pursued,
and little moi'e is being done now than to
hold the land already planted. With 140 in.
of rain a year and jungle growth to match,
even that takes some doing.
When the war started a good many Aus-
tralian trading cos. found themselves handi-
capped by having Germans on their share
registers ; and in some cases—Harrington’s,
for instance —they have been savagely at-
tacked on that account. How to get rid of
the one or two shareholders wild were
threatening to seriously damage the pro-
perty of the general body has been a serious
problem. A scheme has been put forward by
Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia), Ltd.,
in the shape of a resolution, which in effect
says that whenever the Board shall be of
opinion that a share is held by or in trust
for or is under the control of any person,
company or corporation to the prejudice or
possible detriment of the company, the Board
may serve the registered holder with a notice
calling upon him to transfer such share to
some person to be approved by the Board :
and unless the shareholder shall within 21
days intimate in writing his consent to
transfer such share the Board may sell the
share either by public auction or private
contract (in the latter case at a pricp to be
fixed by the auditor of the company as the
fair value of such share at the date of such
notice) to any person approved of by the
Board, and the Board may direct the sec-
retary of the company to enter on tho
register the name of the purchaser in lieu
of the name of the person or company in
whose name the share stood at the date of
such notice. And the purchase money shall
be paid to the manager, whose receipt shall
be a. good discharge therefor, and such pur-
chase money shall be placed by the company
to a trust account.

Y Water, Emmaville (N.S.W.), went off
divs. with the drought and the war. It would
have drifted off the list, anyway, as it had
big doings ahead that called for a long purse.
Things were made difficult through the hang-
up of the metal at the start of the fighting
and the unwillingness of banks to stand up
to the collar. At last the co. got its till
marketed, and then it set to work to sluice
out its final paddock in the eastern ground
before tackling the western area. Six months’
work on the eastern slope has resulted in
818,000 cub. yards being handled for 205 tons
of stream tin. This brings the total ground
handled to 3,175,000 cub. yards for 1851 [
tons of tin oxide, or an average of 1.3001 b.
per cub. yard. What’s ahead now is the
treating of 3,000,000 cub. yards in the west-
ern area. On past records this should take
seven years to sluice. The average tin isn’t
quite so good as that of the eastern dirt
already dealt with. Under engineer Moline’s
advice a lot of old plant is to be scrapped,
and with the barge re-modelled the saving in
costs should pretty well level up the lower
grade of the ground, provided that turgid
mystery, the tin market, keeps steady. As
the co. on July 30 had £19.000 of "tin to
realise against debts of £7OOO, it ought to
begin its Second Time on Earth (the season
starts early in the Now Year) with at least
a bit of cash in hand to cover adjustments,
as well as a good showing of stores and fuel.
There doesn’t seem any good reason why
divs. should not be resumed very soon after-
wards.

The labor position at Broken Hill is still
disturbed, though it is not likely that there
will be any general strike. The Federal
Arbitration Judge gave the men the extra
shilling a shift they wanted, but turned down
the demand for a 44-hour week. He evi-
dently thought the extra money would sat-
isfy them. A big section of the underground
men, however, regard the shorter hours as
of much more importance; and they simply
refuse to work the Saturday shift. It is
no use kicking. The 44-liour week for
underground men is coming at Broken Hill,
wise or unwise, and the sooner the cos.
arrange things accordingly the better.

An illustration of the value of the good

The N.Z. Farmers’ Association of Canter-
bury Ltd. has done wonderful things for the
Canterbury farmer. And that is only
another way of saying that the farmer lias
himself achieved these successes. In the
83 years of its existence the association
has earned in net profits a total of
£636,500, and it has kept many more hun-
dreds of thousands of pounds in the farmers’
pockets by charging him reasonable prices
for his necessities and bedrock rates for the
services it has performed for him in finding
a market for his products. The profits have,
of course, gone back to the co-operators.
And. naturally, the success of their enter-
prise has reacted on the co-operators them-
selves, and they are the keener farmers in
consequence.*

ALUMINOFERRIC is used by the Sydney Water
Board, New South Wales Public Water Supply Depart-
ment, and many country Water Boards and graziers
for precipitating impurities and clarifying water in
reservoirs, cattle dams, etc. It is simply thrown
into the reservoir in the form of a solid cake, or
dissolved and added as a liquid. In three hours’
time the most discolored water will be as clear as
crystal. One pound will clear over 2000 gallons of
water. It is exceedingly cheap and quite harmless.

Extract from The Policy-Holder. London,
November 26, 1913: “The Colonial Mutual has long
had the reputation of being one of the most enter-
prising and ambitious of life assurance institutions,
and to be enterprising and ambitious is to the mod-
ern mind so very much preferable to being inert and
hyper-cautious that the Australian office may well
secure the respectful consideration of many persons
for the commodities it offers because of its up-to-date
pushfulness alone. Only forty years old, almost a
youngster compared with some of our ancient offices,
the Colonial Mutual has, from the commencement of
its career, pressed forward with uncommon determina-
tion and energy. Its growth has been remarkable.”* [6

Investors’ Advisers, Challis House, Sydney
cyanide, wouldn’t give a “tail” at all. The
same rule often applies also to raw
ore. This peculiarity probably explains the
deep-rooted partiality of the average N.S.W.
mining exploiter for the dish instead of the
assay plant. The persistent way in which
people continue to erect batteries on tlie
strength of dish prospects would be amusing
if it wasn’t so wasteful of capital and labor,
but there are so many mines that proper
sampling and assaying would slaughter that
people who make a living by erecting plants
and letting someone else pay for them must
be excused if they much prefer to keep
sampler and assayer off the premises. And,
after all, estimates of dish values are usually
not quite so misleading as assay values when
the average mine manager takes the sam-
ples. The unerring accuracy with which he
will pick out the only bit of “specimen”
stuff in a face of “buck” ore shows how “the
sight of means to do ill deeds makes ill
deeds done.”
Carpathia (N.S.W.) pays a sixpenny div.,
and there’s as much fuss about it as if it
amounted to half a million instead of a poor
little £2017. The directors now know what
it is to run a shockingly-boomed mine—and
a lode-tin mine in particular. Last half-
year they made £4501; at least they said
they made it, though the alleged profits de-
pend on the amount spent on “develop-
ment.” It is absurd, of course, in a mine
like this, consisting of little patches, to
capitalise any mine expenditure. The
whole outlay every half-year should be
regarded as ordinary working exes. Most
of the row is about the high costs. Costs
arc high, but they never are anything else
in a lode-tin mine. A lot of the howling
comes from adventurers who in the early
days pulled the public’s leg shockingly about
the mine and the field, and now have to
make some pretence of explaining why
results are not up to their predictions.
Wild Cherry, Ardletha.i (N.5.,v.), re-
ports 10 tons of concentrates averaging 60
p.c. from S9O tons of crudes. The mill
required just 89 tons of this low-grade stuff
to produce a ton of concentrates, so even if
60 p.c. concentrates realised £B9 per ton the
average would only pan out at 20s. per ton
of crude stuff. And even under the most
favorable conditions you know what that
means at Ardlethan.

Canada will pay a bonus on spelter pro-
duced within the Dominion until July, 1917.
The bounty is to be on a sliding scale, with
a maximum of £8 per ton. Nothing will be
paid unless spelter falls to £33, and the total
payments are not to exceed £SO,OOO. The
idea is to give the producer who goes into
the business now some guarantee that he
won’t be flattened out when the slump comes.

Maldon (Vic.) rallied round the old
South German on the strength of the story
of payable prospects in the North drive oil
the rise at 1750 ft. Boiled down, it looks as
if there may be a foot or so of payable stone
out of a full face of quartz. Off No. 2 winze
there is massive quartz 15ft. wide, assays
running up to 16dwt. It shouldn’t take
much of this stuff to pile up a neat yield ;
but the battery doesn’t always respond to
glowing Maldon prospects. Meanwhile
Tatts tributing party is breaking lOdwt.
dirt to keep up interest. It will be hard
on the crowd if. just as Baxter’s party took
the kernel and left the co. the husk, another
party a year or so later should repeat
history.
George Dickenson’s friends talk £5 as the
winning post for A 1 Gaffney Creek shares
on the strength of the way in which the
bottom of the old mine is developing. But
tipping Mountain claims to give anything
solid has been a risky game, from Mew Loch
Fyne down. The A 1 is on good stuff, but
it is difficult to count up 40s. in sight,
unless “probable” ore is swept in. A Is.
dividend was shelled out in mid-September,
and another is to be paid on October 30
This will make £lB,OOO pouched bv present
shareholders—out of an alleged derelict. As
some of the big holders are sporty, they
appreciate the rush of profits on the eve of
a Cup meeting.

If the Argonaut and South Pioneer work is
added. Ryan in the past year sluiced
738,700 cub. yds. for 383-} tons stream tin
at a cost of 4.388 d. per cub. yd. April
rains enabled him to get going early, so that
a bigger yardage was handled than in
1913-14; but the grade is down from
1.7281 b. per cub. yd. to 1.1941 b., or just about
what was foretold in 1912. This is the fate
of all deep-lead shows, and Ryan is man
enough to tell his Board that, although some
good bores have been got ahead of the faces,
values will farther decline. The price of
tin has also been shrinking. . In 1913 the
average was £218; in 1914, £177 125.; in
1915, £l5l 14s. Of course £2lB was ab-
normal, but the fall of £56 per ton accounts
for a deep cut in divs. Last year only Is. 9d.
was paid. The co. is, however, able to write
off £BOOO from plant and mine, and it
carries forward £14,627, against £14.172
brought forward. Altogether Ryan’s billet
seems a lot safer than Ferdy’s in Bulgaria.
A co. has been formed at llobart to test
I'. 20 acres on Bruni Island for oil. The
capital is £50,000. in 100.000 shares of 10s.
each, but a lot of it is water. The co. in-
tends to get busy with a drill as soon as it
has £5OOO in hand ; and that much looks safe.

“Scratcher”: That yarn of “Stannum’s”
"c the tin deal (B. 30/9/T5) gives one a
fair idea of how matters are at present
etween the smelter and the export buyer.
“Stannum” omits to mention (I presume I
an take this to be so) that he had a tribute
from the Irvinebank Co. (N.Q.) on one of
that co.’s leases. That being so, he binds
aimself to sell his concentrates to the co.
which smelts the concentrates at Irvinebank.
One reason why the export buyer would not
quote would be that the co. invariably uses
the export buyer as a lever to push up the
price whenever the case demands. This fre-
quently happens. When the tribute party
had the quote from Sydney, the co. had to
buy at current rates, as per tribute agree-
ment. When there is fair competition the
export buyer usually gets the tin. The local
smelting co. pays a stiff price for its coke
and then has to reship its tin. Were the
smelter established on the seaboard there
would be some decent competition, out
would go the export buyer and the fly in
the ointment would be removed.
Queensland is on the hunt for molybde-
nite. There is a show, the Day Dream, in
the Wide Bay district, which Perth people
are now putting off, the idea being to first
form a development syndicate. Various
samples have been shown by assay to con-
tain both gold and molybdenite; but quanti-
ties are of course so far speculative, and the
way the promoters speculate about them is
hair-raising.
Ingliston Extended, a Meekatharra (W.A.)
main-line venture in which some Sydney
money is sunk, reports “satisfactory develop-
ments” at 550 ft. At this level the eastern
lode has been driven on for nearly 200 ft.,
and values are said to be payable the whole
way. The management reckons that the
disturbing influence of dykes is becoming
less at depth, and that better prospects are
ahead —or rather below. Hitherto all the
gold won has gone in working and adminis-
tration exes. The adjoining Commodore,
which has Sydney people on its share regis-
ter also, is doing a bit of work at depth, and
it is fervently hoped that this will lead to a
good development. Meantime ore reserves
are being rapidly depleted, and if the co.
does not get the expected turn-up the battery
will soon have to look for another job. For-
tunately the co. is fairly sound financially,
and has a good heap of residues on the sur-
face, out of which it expects to make £4l)0
to £• >OO a month profit for a couple of years
or more.

Oroya Links (W.A.) informs shareholders
m an official circular that it made £4334 for
the second quarter of the year. The Eclipse
workings continue to be the co.’s brightest
star. One winze—the north—lias been sunk
from the 900 ft. level in a wide ore body,
15ft. of which assays 445. Another—the
south—has been put down on a patchy for-
mation, which, however, seems to improve in
depth. Nothing of importance is visible in
either the Oroya blocks or Brownhill leases.
Latterly a much larger percentage of sulphide
ore has been treated, and extraction has on
that account fallen off. Steps are being
taken to remedy this. The Eclipse lease is
practically the only leg the co. has now to
stand on.

The bears of Edna Deeps are not taking
tin'll- gruel kindly, or there would not be so
many rumors about the boring. Only when
some of these were crystallised by questions
in Parliament could vendor Duff and secre-
tary Peacock act. They promptly offered
to have all the facts brought out by a G mi-
mission. Of course, the reply of tlie Mines
Department was the right one. It is not
there to mix up in troubles of the kind, but
the Law can keep a close eye on develop-
ments to see if the bore was a wrong ’un.
The Bulletin has no reason to believe it
was or that there was any fraud. Still, as
all this talk is going on, why not put down a
second bore? That would be good prospect-
ing in .connection with the lay-out of the
mine, and the work could be oversighted
independently so as to silence croakers.
Manager Stuckey’s scheme for cementing
the water out of the shaft may not come
off, and then everything would be in worse
doubt. The Board is to call up the last 9d.
on the 40,000 contribs. Then they will get
power to raise ss. on the whole of the issue
of 60,000 shares, so that there will be no
shortage of cash for equipment and develop-
ment. This preparation for financing
doesn’t augur well for the Edna May amal-
gamation project.
The Australian and Maoriland farmer’s
curse lias been his isolation. Often at
the end of a rough track miles off the road
which leads to the distant railway, and
hundreds and even thousands of miles from
his markets, he has been almost entirely
dependent on an army of assorted agents,
sub-agents, and other ravenous middlemen and
market speculators to make his products
saleable. The existence of this army has
led to the fairly general belief that the farmer
is quite incapable of managing his own
affairs. Actually he is merely a victim of
his isolation. If he requires an implement
of any sort he has to hire the services of an
agent; if he wants wheat-sacks or chaff-bags,
there’s another agent to collect something;
and so it is with almost everything he re-
quires. If he is short of cash the position
is even worse. He finds it necessary to
run yearly accounts with the storekeeper,
and the storekeeper is not above adding a
bit to cover the risk which generally does not
exist. Then to secure ready money he may
sell his crop in advance —a gamble in which
lie is hardly ever a winner. So the com-
plicated business goes on from year to year,
in spite of the fact that the farmers have a
swift and effective remedy at hand.
The farmers of Canterbury (M.L.) solved
the problem 34 years ago when, under the
leadership of the late Charles Ensor, the
N.Z. Farmers’ Co-operative Association of
Canterbury, Ltd., was formed to oust an
exceptionally rapacious group of middlemen.
The co. started business with a paid-up
capital of £3511 and a staff of two —a secre-
tary and an office-boy—and its objects were :
(1) to facilitate the storing, shipment and
sale of co-operators’ produce; (2) to make
advances to shareholders; and (3) to provide
shareholders with tools-of-trade, machinery,
bags and sacks, seeds, etc., at reasonable
prices. Private Enterprise regarded the
efforts of the farmers to co-operate as a
huge joke, and prophesied all manner of sud-
den deaths to the undertaking. A few years
later there was a different tale to tell.
At first the co. felt its way slowly. There
were innumerable obstacles to overcome, and
the management wisely decided to take no
unnecessary risks. The farmer is naturally
conservative, and many still viewed the
scheme with prejudice. After 10 years’ opera-
tions the co. was showing a net profit of
£lO,OOO, and the 2600 co-operators were
proudly displaying a dividend of 11 p.c. on
their paid-up capital, a 4 p.c. bonus on goods
purchased, and a 25 p.c. rebate on commis-
sions—all of which had previously gone into
the pockets of the middlemen. Canterbury
farmers did not require any further evi-
dences of the value of co-operation. The
N.Z. Farmers’ Association of Canterbury
has since grown into the biggest co-operative
concern of the kind in the Southern Hemi-
sphere, and it is the model on which scores
of younger co-op. associations in Australia
and Maoriland have attempted, with more
or less success, to fashion themselves. In
their efforts they get the freely-given advice
and other help of the model society’s offi-
cers. A decade ago there were 2417 share-
holders who had paid £32,525 of capital;
at July 31 this year there were 7568 co-
operators with over £405,000 in the business.
In the same period net profits have bounded
from £BSB9 to £60,031, and last year co-
operators benefited by an additional £7OOO
on a new scheme of cash-sales discounts.
Meantime the staff of two with which the
co. started has expanded to 700.
The steady support accorded the associa-
tion soon permitted the management to ad-
vance far beyond the original intentions of
the promoters, and the co. decided that in
addition to cutting out agents’ commissions
it could also save manufacturers’ profits by
starting its own factories. So the co. now
manufactures its own fertilisers, makes its
own twine and runs its own bacon-curing
factory, In addition it owns commodious
cool stores, specialises in an up-to-date uni-
versal store, sells agricultural machinery of
every kind, and even indents motor-cars.
Now it proposes to co-operate with other
co-ops. in a more general scheme of manu-
facture.
The directors’ latest report deals with the
year to July 31 last, and as this period syn-
chronises with the first year of the war, it
is of more than ordinary interest to see how
co-operators fared in a twelve-month
notable for so many extraordinary hap-
penings and trade restrictions. Dur-
ing the year 121 new converts decided
to co-op., and subscribed capital in
consequence increased to £647,210, of
which £405,011 is paid up. In the co.’s
retail departments the turnover for the year
totalled £544,400, whilst £3,257.795 repre-
sented the full volume of operations in all
branches, against £3,389,426 for the pre-
vious year—a trifling decrease considering
the perturbed state of the world’s markets.
During the year the co. manufactured and
sold 8549 tons of artificial manures —almost
twice the figures five years ago. In its
wool department if offered 12,270 bales —-
22 p.c. of the season’s total offered by all
Christchurch brokers. The output of binder
twine, its chief proprietary line, is now so
great that in addition to supplying share-
holders’ requirements the co. disposes of
large quantities to kindred associations
throughout Australia and Maoriland. In
its financial department, one of the most
important and most vulnerable branches in
such co-operative schemes, advances to
farmers against the security of their lands,
stock and produce stood at £459,450 on July
31 this year. Every one of these advances
was made on the strictest business lines.

LETTER
Syox\ev, October IS. 1015.
My Dear Akini, —
Five members of the Governors’ Union will
meet at Tocumwal on November 12. They’re
going to inspect a third-rail device or some
other equally thrilling piece of Greek. From
the West comes Governor Barron to join his
brothers in meeting “God Save” on the Vic-
torian border.
Lady Helen Ferguson is working overtime
at Reel Cross meetings, and is alleged to have
inspected the uttermost sock in its depots.
On Friday her Ex. opens Rose flail for the
convalescent Kangaroo, who goes there a few
days before. For his part his Ex. has been
making a tour of military camps and seeing
exactly what he has been shown.
G. de Beauvivier, a French wool buyer,
well known in Sydney, has been doing such
gallant things in action in his own country
that he has not only been mentioned in
despatches but the famous War Cross
has been pinned to his uniform. De Beauvi-
vier has been doing his bit for us all since
September, 1014. He led —tell the peaceful
l'ellmongers of it, Arini! —a successful attack
against the enemy at Berry an Bac. The
Sydney Girl, with whom he was very popu-
lar when he merely barked in the wool-
pack, will be pleased to hear that the Hero
has been twice promoted.
The matron of the French Hospital in
Egypt, Princess de I’oix, gave a coffee party
of some splendor in the grounds a few weeks
ago. Among those who asked whether the
lady would take two lumps or three was
Corporal de Lepervanelie. of N.S.W.. a son
of a Narrabri doctor; Sergeant de Tourn-
ouer, of the Queensland Light Horse; and
Sergeant Stevenson, who used to belong to
ice famous Narromine polo team.
The Allies’ Day committee now issues a
bi-weekly Buzzer to keep its campaign diary.
Incidentally, it chases the money-spinning
“Queen” notion to the last fence. As thus:
“There is only one condition to observe. Can-
didates must he over 10 years of age. They
may be married or single.”
Nellie Stewart has withdrawn from the
Paddington “Queen” contest owing to serious
illness on the domestic hearth. John Hop-
kins. who first applied the Queen idea to
patriotic-fund purposes—that was in Napier
(M.L.) —has to return to push the next con-
test at Ilawkes Bay. A. 1,. Blythe, wdiose
ear swings easily around Mosman curves,
takes his place and surges with enthusiasm.
G. A. Pharazyn. one of the Napier sheep
kings, a frequent tripper this way. is presi-
dent of the. forthcoming Mardi Gras —the
impressive title of a spree in which the
shepherd-rulers hope to get £50.000 for tin'
lied Cross from Queen-voting papers alone.
Two hundred pounds cash is offered by these
optimists for the best Court in the Imperial
pageant.
But at the back of their heads most people
have an unpleasant feeling that it shouldn’t
l>e necessary to have such poor circus tricks
in order to raise money for these purposes.
The.ltalian temperament gives warmth and
color to the vocal art of Emma Francesclii.
A girl of If) not long back from her studies
in Italy, she delighted a Sydney audience
with the pure and limpid soprano that floated
round the Town Hall the other evening. Miss
Francesclii, whose proud parent came from
Lismore with her for the Red Cross effort,
is still a student. Some day her silvery
notes should go far in grand-opera roles.
That is if papa, a doctor, intends his trea-
sure to continue her gymnastics when Peace
flutters in. The Bach-Gounod “Ave Maria,”
with Emma’s bird like notes soaring above
the harp and fiddle, brought a storm of
applause from wildly-enthusiastic Italiaus.
A very mild baritone, Henry Seymour, new
to this hamlet, contributed. Truda at the
harp, Panzetta twanging a mandolin, Mowat
Carter scraping the fiddle to vociferous
encores, and Harold Whittle at the piano
completed the company.
The Ideal Home Exhibition is galloping
nearer. On October 25 the 10 days’ show
will be opened by Sir Gerald Strickland in
the Town Hall.
They laid the late Col. Bob Wallace to
rest in Lonsdale cemetery (Vic.) by his last
wish. At sunset the screaming gulls fled
seawards as the men of the R.A.G.A. fired
a volley over the grave of their former com-
rade.
Flower Day, to help the Battalions’Christ-
mas pot. blew in without any fanfare. Mrs.
Hugh Munro, the slim lady who gave the
affair its heartiest push, spent the day in the
Town Hall cellar, which was used as a base
for blooms. A side-show drew a steady
stream of sock-makers. The joy of being
able to keep knitting while others are fight-
ing their way to a new shipment of wool is
turning the feminine glance towards spin-
ning wheels. And here, for the nimble
thrip’ny-bit, Woman could study the machine
tliat used to be regarded as suitable furni-
ture for a museum. Miss Macfarlane kept
the treadle of a quaint Irish “jenny” on the
move, while those present asked its age,
weight and price. In the background was
a Norwegian wheel. This curio, which Mrs.
Maxwell Allen picked up a few years ago,
is very like the engine at which Marguerite
warbles while Faust adjusts his wig-
in the wing. The Flower Day folks aimed at
a star £lOOO, but bagged a mere tallow-
candle £3OO.
The Red Cross dames have welcomed
home Mrs. Danger Owen, who fled to
Colombo for a much-needed holiday, and is
now at it again with renewed vim. She gave
the fruits of her travels in a few heart-to-
heart remarks about socks and nurses’ uni-
forms. Every woman who has passed
through the frenzy of controlling a small
cape can shod a tear of sympathy for the Red
Cross nurse. Doomed to wear a garment
whose chief merit is its antiquity, she finds
its flapping sail almost as troublesome as
the rudder of her tiny bonnet.
Captain Dansey went over by the Moeraki
last week to take charge of the Maori rein-
forcements. His little lot at the Darda-
nelles suffered terribly, but did gloriously.
Very good looking, this Captain Dansey was
educated at the famous Wanganui Collegi-
ate School. His father was an old North
Island public servant; his mother a Maori
lady.
By the Rimutaka, which leaves M.L. pre-
sently, go Mr. and Mrs. Arthur Rhodes and
daughter Marie, of Christchurch. Just a
hurried six months’ trip to see an invalided
only son. This son, Dient. John Rhodes,
A.D.C. to Gen. Godley, a pretty, crimpy-
haired youngster with ideas on polo and pet-
rol, has become a bronzed, serious man of
action since the great strife began. He was in
the Grenadier Guards, but returned to M.L.
as Sir Alex. Godley’s aide, and as such went
to the Dardanelles.
Now it is Drummoyne that is doing some-
thing extra for the fighting Kangaroo. A
“Venetian” water carnival finishes its special
flurry for cash this week. Colored lights will
shed their broken reflection on the water
that laps Dr. Poate’s garden on Saturday
night.
Gifts are coining along well for Allies’
Day. Woman who tore the coney-seal coat
off her back and the rings off her fingers for
Australia Day is now fixing a contemplative
eye on any pictures that can be dragged
from the wall without shedding too much
plaster. Man is on the same track. Ilenri
de Possel, a former manager of the Messag-
eries craft in Australia, has handed over a
sample of Gaston Roulet’s brushwork. Its
price was £4OO. The picture is to be art
unioned.
.Miss May Pudney, a visitor to Sydney
during Race Week, caused so great a buzz of
comment that folks on the outskirts of the
race-crowds weren’t sure whether the noise
was that of a circular saw or an apiary
swarming. Her looks and her gowning are
of the best. She is a Maorilander, but
mostly resident in Europe. Came by the
Medina, and goes back by next trip of the
same boat as far as Colombo, where she will
marry a tea-planter. When Calve was here
some few years ago Miss Pudney was with
her as a kind of sympathetic honorary-secre-
tary. She has a minor-star contralto voice
of her own.
A Charles Dickens fair for the Hunter’s
Hill arm of the Red Cross was housed in
that breezy hubbub’s Town Hall. School-
marm Gallaway, of the C. of E. Girls’ Gram-
mar, organised the show, with Miss C. Ste-
phen as lion. sec. The wind that blows off
the Parramatta River brings warm color to
the cheeks of the Hunter’s Hill flapper, and
red roses, a sharp contrast to the deathlike
pallor of the fashionable city damsel’s make-
up, blushed on many pretty young faces.
In the basketful there was Dorothy Meyers,
a lovely youngster, as Dolly Varden : Wini-
fred Blomfield; Marian Gale; Margaret
Owen, with a magnificent crop of Titian
curls, as David Copperfield in childhood’s
collar: and Daphne Holcombe, as Dick
Swiveller, but much shier than that merry
rogue could have been even in his cradle.
A flock of dainty lambs, wearing the wolves’
clothing of other characters, bleated for

The Francis Chapmans have been steadily
booking their passage to London, via iho
Cape, for some months. Just as steadily
each craft has been taken over for transport
duty. Now they’re likely to give it best,
and camp in Sydney for a while. Artist
Evelyn and mother are just back from the
bumpy Burragorang, where the scenery looks
as if it had fallen out of a theatrical paint-
shop.
Mrs. J. C. Williamson and daughters Mar-
jorie and Tootles are camped at the Palace
Hotel, ’Frisco, where they are feeding
flocks of friends and acquaintances. Dick
Caldwell, who went off to ’Frisco with the
Williamsons, is staying with Mrs. O. C.
Macdonald. They all motored from Van-
couver to ’Frisco in Marjorie’s car.
Mrs. llardy Ballance, who was one of the
lively Cummings sisters, of Melbourne, is
in ’Frisco, too. She lias started a Southern
Cross Fund to finance Nightingales to the
Front.
Harry Riekards’s missus was always prac-
tical. She has broken away from the. usual

They were mostly for the convalescent in

There is to be a cafe ehantant in St.
James’s Hall on October 22, to put a Christ-

Olive Lenton, now in London, writes a
spirited denial of rumors that have been
floating around the theatres. The story
that Jack Vincent, recently wounded at
Gallipoli, is her husband, goads her to re-
mark that, not only has she never seen the
gentleman in her life, but she had never
heard of him till she read in a stage journal
that he was her husband. She thinks it
almost certain she would have known about
it if there was any truth in the yarn.
Journalist Isabelle Ramsay, of the Su.v,
is putting a final flourish on her leave of
absence. Her six months’ jaunts began in
California and are concluding on a N.S.W.
sheep run beyond Gunnedah.
The war-nurses’ Christmas stockings are

One little crowd of Australians has been
quite overlooked. Early in the trouble a
Divisional Ammunition Column was sent
off to Egypt; but, as the vehicles were
nearly all motor-driven, they couldn't plug
through the sand, and the force was accord-
ingly sent on to England. Thence, after
long delay, it or part of it was ordered to
France, where it has been getting some
hard knocks. So far nothing at all has
been done for these fellows, except by indi-
vidual relatives and friends of the 600 or
800 men in the column; but last week a
committee was appointed in Sydney, with
Judge Hamilton as chairman and architect
John Reid, of Equitable Buildings, as
treasurer. Now there’s an opportunity of
letting this little crowd know that they
are not forgotten, even though they are cut
off from the main mob.
Nelson Illingworth’s song feasts came to

Everyone who knows her will be sorry f<li-
the popular Mona Rossiter, who mourns the
sudden death of her father on Sunday morn-
ing, after two operations. He was a retired
Government official. The only son is at the
Front.
A note from the brilliant young man's
father:—
I am afraid you have been misinformed regarding
Laurence Godfrey Smith’s reason for being where he
is. You say his desire to go to the Front was
turned down owing to lack of physique. He was
passed by the doctors in Sydney before leaving here,
and the matter of his physique was never questioned
in London. His uncle, who is in the Home Office,
introduced him to the War Office. He was there
and then installed in that office before he had been
24 hours in England. In fact, he was told that
they wanted hi.s brains, not his carcase.
And I wonder who told him that! Whoever
it was ought to be put somewhere where he
would never again inferentially insult the
tens of thousands of men of brains who have
been sent to the Front.
Acoustics are weird animals. As the Royal
Art Society’s conversazione guests blew in
out of the rain and dashed at the lift in the
new Education Buildings, sounds like the
muffled roar of hungry lions fell down the
well. It was the echo of the proceedings up
aloft, and gaA’e the impression that the

likely runners-up in topical songs. For
instance, 11. E. Horne’s “Australian March-

MELBOURNE CHATTER
Melbourne, October 18, 1915.
My Dear Yarrie,—
On Caulfield Cup day, when the girls had
tired of parading up and down in front of
the other unescorted cats, you could hear
them meowinc plaintively in corners about
"this tei'rible war.” The dressing ranged
from divine to dreadful. Some of the Paris-
ian man-milliners who are now lighting on
the Western front would have thrown them-
selves on the German bayonets if they could
have seen the suburbs’ versions of their
latest masterpieces—the ones they plotted
before the outbreak.
State-Governor Stanley came out with two
Genthelps, and the three of them attended
strictly to business, ignoring the vice-regal
pen completely. His Ex. dragged himself
away after the four-o’clock Steeplechase to
go and open the soldiers’ rest-room at Wirths’
Olympia. It cut me to the heart to see the
Superfluous hurrying away to perform the
Unnecessary.
Mrs. Tye almost two-stepped across the
lawn with hubby after Lavendo, the family
racing-machine, had run off with the Cup.
She wore a belted check suit and a flat, saucy
hat, while the dull black suede of her tall
boots travelled clear down to the heel-tips.
The Herbert Powers arrived in high spirits,
but had to see poor Burrabadeen well
beaten. Reggie Power, just back from some-
where or other, floated about in a new grey
suit and slung glasses cased in bright new
leather. One of the Powex- girls was black-
and-white checked, and the other walked in
smart khaki. Mrs. Herbert Power was im-
mortal in black glace and ivory lace.
Mrs. Leslie Macdonald led the smart
frockers in the pale putty shade of an Aus-
tralian tree-frog, with a parasol colored
orange like the same animal’s queer head.
Fred Fairbairn’s girl looked like a stage
Highlander in her kilt of pale green plaids.
Mrs. Woodforde, wife of the V.A.T.C. chair-
man, watched the sport in cream cloth. Mrs.
Leonard was smart in all-black, and her
sister was another sombre vision , under a
Toreador’s hat; they stepped out prettily
on the lawn at intervals.
I noted Mrs. Thompson’s ermine furs and
nothing else in that neighborhood. Mrs.
Iliskins had the flattest hat on record. Mrs.
It. G. Baldock, from Bananaland, was
wound up in puttees which were also gaiters,
a seal coat and a nigger-brown glace skirt.
Mrs. Monash’s bird-of-paradise hat streamed
in the wind like a military head dress and
suggested the absent colonel-husband, who
has just been made a C.B. Nesta Clarke
was sensational in black and white, like a
good poster. Mrs. L. K. S. Mackinnon wore
a complete red dust-brown outfit of adorable
cut. The Shields widow cheered up her
weeds with a purple plume and a huge gold
purse.
Mrs. Jim McEvoy managed a theatrical
rig. topped with a white pudding basin and
finished with knee-high white boots laced
with tan. Mrs. . Field-d’Antoine (Tas-
mania) exulted with a pink butterfly perched
on her hat. Mrs. Atlee Hunt, who has a
library of dead tropical birds, put a
feathery grey mummy in her hat to watch
the Cup race. Gaud Mayor Hennessy
wore a blue tie and a high hat and suitable,
togs, while his wife walked demurely ill
brown under a flat hat with one flattened
red rose thereon.
Even an animal’s reputation isn’t safe
these times. Current Birdcage gossip al-
leges that one of this season’s horses for-
merly belonged to a Prussian officer, and at
one stage of its career munched oats in the
Kaisei’’s stables. I wonder what he will do
with his poor British backers—if he has
any.
Mrs. Ramsay and her pretty friend in the
tip-tilted hat made three guineas in as many
minutes for their pet scheme of Chi'istmas
presents for naval boys. Three bookies
whose bags were crammed with punters’ gold
were waylaid just after the Guineas meet-
ing and paid up like sportsmen. Mrs.
Ramsay, whose husband is one of our sea-
lieutenants, has a baby daughter to intro-
duce to dad when he comes home from work.
(He has been out now for months.)
The Cafe concerts instigated by Tewkes-
bury, of the Oriental Hotel, are still pump-
ing cash into Lady Stanley’s fund for the
wounded. One of the series happened on
Tuesday, wdien Sassiety’s first-line duchesses
wex - e arrayed as highway robbers. They
took up a good strategic position in the
lounge and sold everything, from pin-
cushions to champagne. The race-game was
stowed away in a secluded corner of the
hotel; but the real business of the day was
transacted in the big dining-room. Enthusi-
astic feeders were allowed to reseiwe special
table seats by adding a shilling to the five-
shilling entrance fee. It was worth the
money to the earnest gorgers who like to
take their food seriously. They sat and
lucked into tea and fruit-salad in deadly
fear they would not be able to encompass
six-shillingsworth, while the performers tried
to make their voices heard above the chatter
ami the clatter. Florrie Young and Reg
Roberts did not turn up to keep their pro-
mises ; but Olive Godwin, bound in white
•cloth, sang like a robust angel. Alfredo, the
violinist from the Tivoli," who wears an
Italian velvet coat and busted property-
boots, played some waltzes beautifully. The
result of the riot was £250 in assorted
change.
.Mrs. Merritt, of Ivew, ran a cake stall
with the help of her daughter. Mrs. Thomp-
son. of Malvern, brought in bushels of roses
and gave them to fluffy girls to sell at about
2s. (id. a sniff. Mr. Tewkesbury auctioned
an Italian flag for £25 and a Belgian ban-
ner for £50 —so that dodge still has money
in it sometimes. It was a well-ragged affair;
you’ll realise how good the clothes were when
I tell you the Fairbairn girls, the D’Ebros
and the Whitings and the Grices and the
Landales led the van. The Stanley dame
had hoped to be present, but her hopes were
dashed, and the Madden dame wasn’t avail-
able as a vice-regal substitute. However,
the hotel was crammed to overflowing with-
out them, and if they had attended it would
have been necessai'y to clear spaces for them
with a grab dredge. A few misguided men
swam about for a while, but were finally
washed up in the bar.
From the Adelaide Front: —
The employees at the Islington loco-works have
added one more motor-ambulance to the credit of
this State. The gift was presented on Thursday.
Three fetes and two concerts raged on Saturday.
Of the former, one was at Austral Gardens in aid
of the Minda Home for Weak-minded Children, and
another at the Price Memorial Oval, Hawthorn, for
the Defenders’ Friendship Association, which under-
takes to send comforts to the troops. The third
fjive the Red Cross funds a leg up in the grounds
of Mrs. William Campbell’s house, North Adelaide.
Lady Galway managed to go to a couple of the fix-
tures, and in the evening took his Ex. and Miss
d’Erlanger to the Queen’s Hall concert, arranged
by Lieut. Walsh —a Repertory Theatre member—in
aid of the Wounded Soldiers’ Fund. (Hold on! I’m
not finished yet !) The Commercial Travellers had
a musical outburst at the Town Hall for the same
purpose, and collected a carpet-bag of cash.
The Graham Stewarts have received news that their
eldest son George, who was a lieutenant in the
Cameron Highlanders, and had won his D.C.M., has
been killed. Col. Price Weir, who has been in-
valided to London after four months in Gallipoli, has
cabled to say that he is doing well.
Anzac Day, which superseded the usual Eight-
Hours’ celebration, got a crowded start in gorgeous
weather, and the result was well over £3OOO.
The second day of the S.A.J.C. meeting duly
occurred at Victoria Park, and one steeplechaser was
so delighted that he fell down and died. The Gal-
ways were at the Burra, where they attended a cele-
bration in connection with the Cheer-Up Society ; but
the Governor hurried back for the first day’s racing,
and saw Perambulate annex the Derby and Master
Tasso pay a £62 dividend in the Trial Stakes.
Cecil Bray, who left here for England early in
July with his own car fitted as a motor-ambulance,
crossed over to France in September, when he ex-
pected to be located in the Vosges district. K. L.
Colley, who sailed from here about two months ago,
has also gone to one of the wars.
What is known as Angas College, in North Adel-
aide, has been leased to the Federal Government as a
hospital for infectious diseases for men on active
service, but not without some yelping from that
suburb’s councillors, for the College is located in
a populous part. The building was originally Whin-
ham College, and was used for a time as a mission-
ary-seasoning depot. The students are now fattened
somewhere else.
There died at Walkerville on Thursday the widow
of the late Archdeacon Dove, in her 78th year. 1
hear on excellent authority that she arrived in Aus-
tralia with her husband in ’6l. I didn’t see them
disembark myself.
Dave Gordon, M.L.C., has received word that his
second son, Lieut. J . R., has been invalided home, and
is shortly due in Melbourne. He left as a sergeant
in the 10th Battalion, and took part in the landing
of April 25. He was promoted on the field, and,
later, had charge of a machine-gun section. His
brother is also reported ill, and in hospital in Cairo.
The Cheer-Up Society farewelled about 2000
soldiers at the Exhibition on Friday evening, and
the speeches were heavily sub-edited. His Ex.
couldn’t come, but he sent a letter with some good
advice wrapped up in it.
Dead, Hugh Malet Chapman, of Maitland, chemist
and best-loved man in ail Yorke Peninsula. Of his
61 years 40 had been spent in Australia. Like many
big-hearted men he was followed,all his life by bad
luck. (Perhaps that’s what makes them big-hearted.)
An enthusiastic golfer, on the day of his death he
had spent the- afternoon on the links, and returned
home in the evening to peacefully die. As a dis-
penser Chapman made only one mistake; he fre-
quently forgot to send in the bill.
A sad happening of the past week was
the death in Tasmania of the G.-G.’s pretty
niece, Gladys Mandeville, who collapsed sud-
denly after an operation for appendicitis.
She was very popular here last year when
she stayed some weeks at Federal Govern-
ment House. A sister visited the Fergu-
sons during the winter.
Henry Harper has taken over the job of
Chief Embarkation Officer now that Harold
Grimwade is bound for active service with
his artillery. Guy Madden is helping
Henry. I hear he is particularly useful at
marshalling the nurses.
Parson Griffiths, the wealthy churchman
who formerly toiled with bell, book and
candle in the Western District, has got his
wish, and is off to minister to soldiers some-
where in the field. He got the job in Eng-
land. Daughter Mollie, the Royal Golf
champion of hereabouts, has just sent a
coo-ee from the other side and a parcel of
extra-special sticks to one of her old Sand-
ringham playmates.
George Blackwood and Billy Bayles have
donned the blue of the special constable, and,
with silver-mounted batons concealed up their
sleeves, are guarding the precincts of Buck-
ingham Palace. Let’s hope that if they are
attacked it will be with scented sandbags
and hand-painted bricks.
On a hot day last week one of the returned
convalescent soldiers appeared in Gollins-
street in his “shorts” —and the simple, con-
ventional townsfolk opened their mouths
and walked backwards.
Golf champion Ivo Whitton is back home
in Australia with his mind full of wool.
He has just completed a year in England
wrapped up in wool, and I hear was one of
the men with special knowledge who were
held back from active service in the field.
Ivo, however, now intends to enlist at this
end. He says that golf in England has
fallen away to nothing. The best of the
younger sportsmen are already fighting, and
many of the English links have been gashed
with training trenches. Whitton played in
some patriotic games, but says he will not
play a round for amusement here or any-
where else while the war is on. The clubs
are drinking in his words and looking very
gloomy about it.
Louise Mack has landed back at Adelaide
after a triumphant Westralian season.
Louise asserts once more that she “loved”
the West and its people, and yearned to
sleep out all night among the wild flowers,
and I don’t know why she didn’t do it,
because there is no law against satisfying
this particular yearn. She had a theatre in
Perth all to herself, and the James knight
and his wife gave a lunch party in her honor.
Louise sat next to the Archbishop, whom she
says “spoke more like a man than a bishop
about making ammunition in Australia.”
The frugal motorist who saves up his
petrol-cases and sells them to the bottle-oh
ac fourpence a time has been given a small
opportunity of rendering war-service.
Colonel Head, O.C. at the Royal Park camp,
lately made a stirring appeal for cases with
which the men of his command might pro-
tect the remnants of their daily bread-aud-
jam from being haunted by flies. The
result was a pyramid of boxes from all parts
of the metropolis, and the recruit now goes
forth to his trenching in the. knowledge that
there will always be a bite of clean food in
the larder.
Another of the Malvern-mad Robb girls,
one of whom was lately married to Lieu-
tenant-Colonel Downes (now patching up
soldiers at Lemnos, or thereabouts), has
taken her man for good or better. This
time it is Eileen, and the chosen one is
Charlie Hamilton, the hefty son of an
esteemed Adelaide doctor. The ceremony
occurred in that exclusive odor of sanctity
which is only to be sniffed in Melbourne at
the grey old church on Eastern Hill.
Alexandra MacLeod, whose little sister
was lately wed to soldier Ken McWhae, has
safe-deposited her land and heart with
solicitor Grenville Silvester, of Casterton.
The Silvester crust-foundry is within
motor-dash of the late Alec MacLeod’s Tal-
isker acres, once a part of that Merino
Downs squattage where uprose the his-
toric timbers of the first white man’s dwell-
ing in the inner Western District. The
families are old allies.
Mildred Manifold, the elder of the two
rich Willie Manifold daughters, is about
to get mai’ried in England to Foster Rut-
ledge, of the Western District family. He
is training to be discourteous to Gex-mans.
Edith Haines, the Western District
squatter’s daughter, is engaged to one of
the sheep-farming Edgar family. As the
young man intends to pass the Turk one
before the ceremony, you needn’t get your
confetti yet.
Gordon Landale (he belongs to the Alec
Landale family) was shrapnelled some time
ago in France. He enjoyed it so much
that he is now hoping to go back to try it
again.
Parcels are being sent to our naval war-
riors for Christmas. Miss Rennie, of the
Quamby Club, and her sister are doing the
packing and forwarding, and through them
friends may send packages addressed per-
sonally to anyone on any of the ships. The
last day of sending is October 23, and if
you haven’t got a spare stocking about you
the Quamby Clubbers can supply one for
sixpence.
1 have it on the word of Mrs. Barlow
that the absurd little golliwogs brought in
£l4OO for the good cause. It is a stagger-
ing result; but, then, Melba was president,
and Melba has the golden touch.
Ever since “The Great Adventure” in
July last the Repertory Theatre has been
dumb and the enthusiasts have been mak-
ing socks and shirts for the whole wide
world —or all the fighting part that sides
with us. To saA’e time some of them
have given themselves indigestion by relying
too much on the hasty tea and scone. Some
mere brain-food is, however, being prepared
for them. The Theatre gets to work again
on Saturday, October 23. with three famous
short plays, including Eden Phillpotts’s
“Hiatus,” which has a woman-journalist as
central figure. Nothing is too sacred for
these Repertory play-writers to handle.
From a girl in Cairo : —-
Mrs. Frank Austin, of Avalon, who has been here
for the past three months, has gone back to Aus-
tralia. She is much missed by the wounded lvan-
gfaroo, for whom she did no end <sf odd jobs. She
was also “at home” to Australian nurses twice a
week, and many a tired sister could thank her for
happy hours of rest and relaxation. Matron Oram,
head of all the English nurses in Egypt, is here.
She has had a very distinguished career, and across
her left breast wears a long line of service ribbons.
Shirley Nicholson, the attractive daughter
of the late P.M., pops up again as Mrs. Eddie
King. In pre-war times she did much suc-
cessful stage work after graduating in Her-
bert Tree’s dramatic school, and latterly,
with her friend the Duchess of Newcastle,
she has been busy entertaining wounded
Australian soldiers. (P.S. —Everybody now
entertains wounded soldiers.)
Muriel Starr perpetrates a couple of regu-
lar dress-shrieks in “Nobody’s Widow.” A
green evening gown in the second act and
an elaoorate pink dressing-jacket in the last
recall to you all the sorrows of the world.
Grace Palotta wears some heavenly gowns —
wears them, please—but somebody should be
boiled for forcing her to come on in a dress-
ing-room scene with her hair screwed up on
top of her head and her piquant face hidden
behind a rampart of cold cream. A few
extra dresses which Muriel Starr doesn’t get
a chance to wear she displays in a huge and
wonderfully up-to-date trunk, the fittings of
which cause a gasp right through the house.
When there is a gasp to be got, one
must not revolt at the absurdity of a rich
guest arriving at a big country house, and
ordering her luggage to be brought into the
sun parlor.
Wirths’ Circus came to town and un-
packed its elephants last Saturday. And
a few things besides. A novelty is a stage
complete with curtains. One of the brothers
has just come back from the U.S. with a
hatful of new ideas and the laurels won by
equestrian-daughter May. The torrent of
circus animals, tents, props and folk poured
down to town from Castlemaine (where the
Friday show had been given) in time to
open at Olympia on Saturday afternoon.
A member of the firm fled in front of the
avalanche in a swollen Iloggenheimer coat
and a touring car. The part of the big
show that fascinates ire is the act of two
little pink-winged, white-tighted Russian
girls who frolic like birds about a gold
trapeze. They almost tempt me to buy a
pair of pink wings for myself and take a
few flying lessons.
Mary Stirling, the blue-eyed dimply
daughter of big Maggie Stirling, is not
dropping the singing business altogether
now that she is the wife of Dr. Pat Croome.
On the contrary, she is searching for a harp
on which to accompany herself. But it’s
quite difficult to bag a harp, I believe.
Maud Fenner has again set off for Eng-
land with her friends the Stewart Murray
pair. Maud and Mrs. Stewart Murray have
swagged it together on numerous occasions.
This time the Murrays are thinking of a
long stay, as Stewart is to manage the
London end of John Sanderson’s shipping co.
Norman Mac George has, without fuss of
any sort, opened a show of Australian lai_J-
scapes and hand-made furniture at the Show
studios, Stott’s Buildings, Market-street.
This corner is to be the cradle of a new
venture in handicraft, translated into hand
made furniture and artistic house fittings at
actual cost—or something near it.
Yours sincerely,
JOHANNA.

"Sarto” : “Two Seas” (B. IG/9/T5) pulls
me over tile coals for placing- apple-tree last on the
list of burning woods. Allow me to tell “Twc
Seas” that there are two apple-trees. The one 1
am acquainted with, common to these parts
(Southern • Riverina, N.S.W.), is botanically
l.ucalyptus stuartiana. The other is r.ot a eucalypt,
burns better (it would need to), is more
muscular looking, and grows. I think, in North-
ern N. S. Wales. B. stuartiana grows to a fair size,
the bark is rough, the leaves long ami glossy-, the
foliage drooping and, on a windy day . a very pretty-
sight, glistenin';- in the sunlight. Unless thoroughly
dry and then aided and abetted by better fuel this

pose!”
wood will not burn. I’ve known an apple-tree, felled
two or three years before, to be quite green when
split. It splits easily, by the way, and is a great
favorite of grubs. The joints of the tree are brittle,
making- climbing dangerous. If “Two Seas” has
nothing between him and starvation but a sausage
to be well done with my apple-tree, he can make
out his last will and testament. And if lie leaves
me well provided for I’ll have a nice coffin made
for him out of this wood, in which he should feel
very comfortable, because, as I’ve said before, it
won’t burn.
“Ivuku-Kuku” : The lakatoi fleet has left
I’ui-t Moresby (Papua). This is worth noting, for it
has been said, this last few years, that the wonderful
New Guinea canoe with the crab-claw sail, familiar
on tlie stamps of the Territory, was rapidly- becom-
ing extinct. And, indeed, the great westward voy-
age had been left out more than once. It is some
hundreds of miles from Port Moresby, where they
make the pots, to the great rivers and deltas of the
West, whence the sago comes. Since time unheard
of the Port Moresby canoes have taken the last of
the south-east trade each year, down westward, bear-
ing their cargoes of pots, and coming home after
several months, helped by the nor'-west trades, with
bundles of sago enough to last the villages a good
few weeks at least. But a year or two ago a clever
native bought a big cutter, and began regular trad-
ing. lou can sail a cutter somehow or other in
almost any weather, while a lakatoi, made up of 10
or 17 canoes lashed together and decked, cannot run
satisfactorily with its crab-claw sail on anything
but a following breeze. So the cutter did the work
of a whole fleet. Then the cutter got wrecked, and
the natives decided that the old ways were best.
And once more the stately fleet of lakatois, most
beautiful of all floating or sailing things in the Paci-
fic, sets forth among the launches and steamers of
Pert Moresby- in its great adventure west. It. is still
an adventure, for the tribes of the West are cannibal,
though the Government has them more or less under
control. Long ago it was a journey full of peril
irom beginning to end, and one wonders that the
timid and harmless MoUurns ever laid the nerve to
undertake it—that is, if one does not remember that
the Papuan’s chief passion in life is trading, and
Unit he will venture his existence on a chance of a
deal ’ any day. This year’s lakatoi fleet begins a
new era in native trading, for the Motuans have set
forth loaded up, not only with the usual pottery , bi t
with all sorts of European trade goods from the Port
Moresby stores. They are cheerfully- confident of
figurately “skinning the js!ill ignorant heathen of
(lie Western rivers—provided lie does not, literally,
•skin them first.
"S. 8. Severn” : We decided to fire Ah
Mat, Malay, and get a new cook. lie came; a
Manila man, spotless in shining duck, and bowed
himself in. Could he cook? Oh, certainly, lie had
once made a curry for a Rajah, since deceased.
Salary His last master had given him a pound a
week, but had not paid him tor two moons. Name?
"Name belong me,” lie said, quite casually, “San-
tiago Simplicio Aleandro de la Santa Maria.” Tin-
boss said he couldn’t swear at a name like that--it
would take too long'. So we gave Ah Mat another
chance and a shilling- a month more on condition
iliat lie spilt no more cigarettes in the curry-. 1
wonder who the joker was who handed that diction-
ary of dates to the Manila boy?
“Barto : I witnessed to-day a peerless
exhibition of fly ing. A hawk, high up, circled grace-
fully round and round, coining nearer and nearer,
hovered a second and fin-
ished with a beautiful vol-
plane to earth. A magpie,
the most beautiful vol-
planer I know, glode past
with a swish, rising again
to perform some tumbling
feats in mid-air. A ground-
lark or sand-triputr scam-
pered along a few paces,
shot almost straight up
about 10ft., hovered with
the caught insect a mo-
ment, then executed the
most graceful and perfectly
perpendicular dive I have
ever witnessed. This littje.
bird scratches any sore of
a nest-in any oid place in
the glass—hard to locate,
though, if one depends on
the bird to show him. The
eggs iusually three) are
light-pink, thickly- blotched
with red. Next came the
champion lioverer of the
bush, a tiny bird we call
the “cow-dung,” but why
T don’t- know. He is a
little g’rey fellow with a
white tail, and can hang-
suspended in mid-air for
seconds, presumably tak-
ing observations. Now
there flew past a noisy
minah pursued by a dimin-
utive tom-tit —Zeppelin and
biplane. Then flapped by
the lumbersome cuckoo,
the most undignified flier
in bird-dom. He gets
along like I should imag-
ine an aeroplane wouild
whose shaft has been broken.
“F.H.R.”: That par. (B. 16/0/M5) about
the overdose of wood used in battening up lucerne
reminds me of an incident that occurred in the
Tamworth (N.S.W.) district a few years ago. Being-
short of one batten to finish up a consignment the
cocky raked up a fence post, and pressing it well
into the fodder opined that “That’ll do.” Some
weeks later the kids came home from the post office
with the news that there was a parcel there for Dad
with ss. to pay-. Dad took charge after parting up
the dollar, and found as much of his fence post as
could be squeezed through the parcels post. It cured
more than Dad when the news got round.
“Simplex”: “Slipraii” (B. 22/7/’lo)
wants a. reliable method of keeping mice from liav-
stacks. Right. Two pounds of sulphur for every
ton of liay in the first three feet from the ground,
Sprinkle half the sulphur on tlie ground floor of the
stack, balance to be scattered over the next five
layers of sheaves. The sulphur will do stock no
harm, as it is a blood purifier. I'll eat all the mice
“Slipraii'’ finds in a haystack treated as above.
A QUESTION OF DIPLOMACY.
SMOODOING DAN ( about to interview the Lady of the ’Ouse): “ Wot'll I say I am. Fowl-
house —a wounded soldier or a Belgian refugee?”
“lliiflin-Guffin” : Mention of Robert Smart
overlaudiig from Adelaide to the diggings in Victoria
(B. 30/9/’l5) reminds me. Over 30 years ago I
walked a day's journey with old Johnny Sutton, one
.of,the Lake Condah (Vic.) tribe of aboriginals, who
told me a long, rambling story about certain “white
phellers,” returning- from the diggings to S.A.,
attempting to cross the G'lenelg River somewhere
between Harrow and Morea (six miles apart) and
losing their gold—£lB,ooo worth—in the water.
It was never recovered, Johnny said. Anybody- ever
heard of such a happening? What was the usual
route from S.A. to the diggings? It must have been
fairly well defined, but though a resident of Western
Victoria for most of my life I have never heard
much about it.
“Hugo Knapp”: This is a snake yarn
with the brand of veracity upon it, A young Eng-
lishman employed on a Hawkesbury (N.S.W.) farm
saw a snake at the butt of a tree. With a stick a
couple of feet long he walloped it on the back, high
up. As he struck, a second snake sprang from
nowhere and made fast on the young fellow’s right
arm. Dazed by this unexpected attack, the lad
toppled over and lay still. He believes ho-eooeed
for help; but otherwise he made no sound _oy-mover
ment. About five minutes later, it is thought, a
man came along, saw the boy on the ground with
the snake still coiled round his arm, and the other
snake dead alongside. He manoeuvred about, and-
was at length able to seize the live snake by the
neck and drag it off to die. The boy was almost
paralysed and incoherent. On his arm was a speck
of blood. The rescuer brushed this off, but saw no
punctures. Possibly the blood was from one of the
dead snakes. At any rate, he sucked at the spot.
Then he -got a scared boy home. The boy is still
alive. It is now said that the snake must have
bitten the boy’s clothes, and felt satisfied about the
result. Another suggestion is that the cooeeing
charmed it into a reasonable and kindly mood. One
snake measured four feet six. inches; the other an
inch less. They were of* the blackest and most
vicious variety'.
“Tiger”: An immigrant, teat-persuading
for a cocky, was noticed to wash with carbolic soap
immediately before and after milking. Cocky rec-
koned this cast some reflection on his cows, and
became annoyed. “Wbatya mean by this stinkin’
soap-washin’ business, Claude?” Claude stammered
out: “Well, boss, I’m not afraid of the cow-pox,
but I wouldn’t like to catch this milk-fever thev
talk about.”
“Bad Australian” fires another shot from
the Andes:—
“G.J.H.” (B. 10/0/’lu) is an amusing young .cuss,
and for his information 1 would say that I have
done enough shooting with all kinds of automatics
at ordinary targets to satisfy me that the auto does
jamb and that fairly often. Autos, are dear and
nasty at any price when out against a live target
which is ready to respond in kind, and I have known
two occasions on which the man with the auto, was
translated to glory in short order through his. gun
going back on him. If “G.J.H.V’ gun has worked
well for years the reason is plain—he uses a small
calibre and a correspondingly lightly-loaded cart-
ridge. This accounts for his little popgun having
no jump and giving no trouble through swollen or
fractured cases sticking in the barrel. Further, if
“G.J.H.” knew anything about shooting on the drop
he wouldn’t gabble about “jump” or “shooting be-
tween chalked lines.” I admire his enthusiasm, but
being an old battler in places where the heathen
rage and the unregenerate are out after blood, I say
gimme the Colt, and let it be a .44 at that. I don’t
care 40 cents whether the Colt throws a bullet 999
or 1000 yards as long as it puts the acid on the
enemy up to 100 metres. Beyond that range I use
a rifle or a mule battery, and when the contract
reaches, its limit I borrow a 40 centimetre howitzer
from arHunnish pal of mine who lives on the summit
of the next cerro.

“I’fi'yauder ’: Tlio largest existing shark
(B. 23/9/T5) is Rliinodon typicus (Indian Ocean).
In the Singapore Museum is a skeleton 51ft. long.
This species is closely allied to the basking shark,
which runs .to 40ft. I have seen the skeleton of
one (over 30ft.) that had been killed at Portland
(Vic.) in 1883. Both these sharks are harmless,
having teeth only about- a quarter-inch long, A
very different proposition is Carcharodon rondeletii,
the dreaded white shark of the Atlantic, now getting-
very rare. In the Naples.,Aquarium is a skeleton
42ft. feet long-, with teeth measuring 3in. to the

Our prophets and preachers have branded this kissing
With bell, book and candle and cursing and hissing,
But Minister Black

And traces the spread of this fell meningitis
To lips that alluringly laugh and invite us,
Jo pussies whose cuddle is plain meningitis.

Yes —there are hidden beauties in your records
'* Preserving the violin’s delicate tonal hues as never accomplished before.
<>v
HUSHED it comes forth from the violin, a wonderment of tonal beauty. It is the magic
sound of strings on wood, No instrument has ever truly reproduced that sound—none
“till the Vocalion came.”
Because the Vocalion’s Sounding Board—built on the piano principle—responds sympa-
thetically to the vibrant sound waves of the violin. It qualifies the least tendency to metallic
severity, even while all the qualities in the new Symphonetic Horn are preserving the violin’s
delicate tonal hues-as never accomplished before. They preserve the same “tonal purities”
in all instrumental or vocal sounds.

Recipe to Stop Dandruff.
This Home-made Mixture Stops Dandruff
and Falling Hair and Aids Its
Growth.
To a half-pint of water add: —
Bay Rum . loz.
Orlex Compound a small box.
Glycerine ioz.
These are all simple ingredients that you
can buy from any chemist at very little cost,
and mix them yourself. Apply to the scalp
once a day for two weeks, then once every
other week until all the mixture is used. A
half-pint should be enough to rid the head of
dandruff and kill the dandruff germs. It
stops the hair from falling out, and relieves
itching and scalp diseases.
Although it is not a dye it acts upon the
hair roots and will darken streaked, faded,
grey hair in 10 or 15 days. It promotes the
growth of the hair and makes harsh hair soft
and glossy. [4

Look to Your Teeth.
There are no teeth like those furnished by
Nature. For service, comfort, and good
health, artificial teeth cannot be com-
pared with a natural set.
Sensible people will accordingly try to pre-
serve their teeth as long as possible by
keeping them clean. Cold water and soap
and water are useful, but are somewhat
ineffectual. Rough powders, such as cuttle-
fish, crabseyes, crude chalks and charcoal
are too severe on the enamel.
EUDENTA TOOTH PASTE is scientifi-
cally prepared to clean the teeth, sweeten
the breath, harden the gums and disinfect
the mouth (thus preventing decay).
EUDENTA is therefore*: regarded as “the
perfection of dental luxuries.” 1/- tube every-

“Lou”: “BarcooV’ idea (B. 23/9/’l5) to
throw the mother-cows and hobble their hind legs
to keep them on the camp is new (to me) and a
good one, but he omits to mention why it is good.
Lee me. When a cow or a bullock wishes to rise
it must straighten out or rise on its hind props
first. That is why one man can keep a beast down
by sitting on its quarters. A horse gets up the
opposite way, straightening his forepins first, so
to keep him down you merely sit on his face. And
to throw one—well, I saw Ted Ayres, a Flinders
River overseer, draw his nag’s head round to the
oft side, press one knee into his forearm, pull with
both hands on his wither, and down the moke came
quite comfortably.

“llloola”: Sometimes in this land of
uncertain rainfall the moisture does arrive when
asked for. When Cataract Dam wall was up to
about 70ft. high at the lowest point, a gap left for
flood waters, the Sydney Water and Sewerage Board
decided to close the valves and commence storage.
It was the end of August, and the Board was anxious
to impound the flow from the expected spring rains.
A stream a couple of inches deep was flowing through
the pipes on the morning of the day the valves were
shut down. At the dam the day opened with a
drizzle, settling down to steady rain before night;
but on the catchment farther up it rained in torrents.
At midnight the water was over the wall, and by
morning a stream 10ft. deep was pouring through
the 30 yards-wide gap. The other day the Murrum-
bidgee Irrigation Commissioner was hurrying the
contractors to get the Burrinjuek dam up to the
HOOft. level, so as to impound water to that level.
The water was then 1083 ft. Again the rain obligingly
got a move on, and one day after the last lift of
concrete was put in the water flowed over the wall.
Four days later, though the sluices had been opened,
the river was 22ft. over the 1100 ft. mark, and por-
tion of Burrinjuek city was just managing to keep
its roof above water. The Murrumbidgee is certainly
something special when it's in flood.

“Billy T.”: There was something the
matter with Dwyer's arm. Pat was sitting about at
home all day apostrophising it. Pat’s apostrophes
were worth hearing. He bared the offending limb,
laid it along a log in the sun, and his words
were sweet music. When Pat’s objurgation reached
a certain intensity Mrs. Dwyer paddled out with her
bottle of horse liniment, and massaged the arm for
an hour at a time. “I’m doin’ ut tree times the day
long ’n’ one-ha’f the noight through,” Mrs. Pat con-
fessed to a neighbor. “ ’Tis nooritus he have, poor
man, ’n’ roomatic nooralgy, ’n’ nothin’ will aise him
at all but the rubbin’ wid the lotion me granda in-
vinted fer mendin’ horses.” Mrs. Pat Dwyer’s gran-
da’s horse-wash for the cure of Christian sinners was
a great and continual joke at Peabody. Then one
afternoon came Mrs. Dwyer groaning among a knot
of her neighbors and nursing an eye. “Oeh!” said
she, “ ’tis the beautiful imbrocation me granda made.
Look what it’s done fer me poor bye’s sore ar-rm
already, will yeh?” And she proudly displayed a
black eye like.a prize plum.
THE CURBED DRINK.
“Good-day, Billy. How are you this morn-
ing?"
“Rotten! All-a-same Boss up at a house
—rotten EVERY morning!”
“Cangai”: Let me put some recent con-
tributors right about the water hyacinth. It was first
introduced into Aluinny Creek (not Swan) by a woman
more than 15 years ago. Swan Creek was never
navigable for anything more than a duck hunt. The
■Orara only made one trip to the Clarence; and
although large clumps of the nuisance make their
way down the river, she was never blocked from get-
ting to the wharf at Maclean. There the river is
nearly three-quarters of a mile wide and as salt as
the ocean. As a matter of fact, water hyacinth has
so far caused very little inconvenience in the Clar-
ence to shipping, except in the case of punts which
cross the river on wires.
WARNED.
NEWCHUM M ISSIONARY: “I suppose there arc no dangerous blacks out here now?”
WOLLOMBI JACK: " Duntio, Boss ; but you better look out for some of them dels.”
“Merrigal”: I had a pack-horse with a
long-standing fistula on the wither which all the
common remedies failed to cure. A hawker recom-
mended the liquid resulting from boiling two hands-
ful of wild-cherry bark in four or five quarts of
water over a slow fire sufficiently long to extract all
the sap, which contains a large quantity of tannic
acid. After allowing the mixture to stand for some
time, and having drained it, I opened the fistula and
poured in the liquid while yet warm. Next day
there was much proud flesh. I cut it away and
repeated the attention on each of eight or nine days,
until no such flesh remained. Then the supporting
“core” worked out, and after rinsing the sore with
warm water and common soap daily for a fortnight
a complete and lasting cure was effected.
“Billy Blue”: The kurrajong tree (B.
9/9/’l5) and its useful qualities soon became known
to the early settlers in N. S. Wales. Collins, the his-
torian, says: “During the month of April (1797) a
tree was for the first time observed growing on the
banks of the Hawkesbury, the bark of which, when
soaked in water and beaten, was found to be as good
as hemp for cordage; spinning easily, and being re-
markably strong. This tree grew from 50ft. to 70ft.
high ; its diameter was from the smallest size to a
foot, and it appeared to be of a quick growth. This
was rather a fortunate discovery; for every kind of
cordage belonging to the settlement was wholly ex-
pended.” At this date Hunter was Governor of the
colon}', and in despatches giving his annual re-
port of the employment of the convicts for the years
1797-8-9 lie has this item each time: “One rope-
maker and one assistant making cordage for various
uses out of curryjong.” In 1802 Acting-Surveyor
General Grimes in reporting on the Hunter River
above the Paterson wrote: “There is very little car-
radjang up this part of the river.” Chas. Harpur in
his play, “The Bushrangers,” published in 1853,
shows that the connection between the kurrajong and
rope-survived as late as the ’fifties:—-
Farmer: I tell you again, I’m John Crabtree, of
the Iverrijong.
Bomebard: In course you air; yes, and you'll
soon get kerrijonged and no mistake (making signs
significantly of his being hanged). Iverrijong? No;
but good English hemp, my cricket.
In a footnote Harpur explains that the aborigines
made their nets from the inner bark of the kurrajong
and that “during the Croppy outbreak several of
the insurgents-were hanged with halters twisted out
of the bark of the kerrijong; they were executed
in the bush under martial law and the tree which
furnished the rope was also the gallows.”

“Eddyson”: “Will yeh notice the hut
behint McGuire’s?” said Flynn. “There’s a histhry
attached t’ that same. Phil Phelan was resident in

Phil was growin’ poorly, Phil built the log hut yeh

agin, I’ll be suitably provided,’ he sez. ’Twas a
long time, ’n’ I got no hint at all iv his meanin’;
’n’ manewhile Mrs. Phelan died, poor body. ■ Mrs.
Phelan was one iv three sisthers lived next Phelan

next iv kin, Maria ’n’ Patricia O’Dea, tuck a hand
in the thrainin’ ’n’ management iv Phelan, ’n’ the
last wor-rds iv Ann, I’m told, adthresst to her sis-
thers, was: ‘Ye’ll marry him, Maria, or Pathricia,

made hon’rable promise she’d not lave Phil lonesome

maybe, I get me inklin’ iv the use Phelan would
make iv his blockhouse, whin I seen him dash up
the shmall ladder provided, ’n’ pullin’ the shteps
afther him, dishappear troo the dure in the roof.
Lookin’ over the fince I’m inthristed t’ find Miss

Iv’ry time Maria makes a lovin’ advance t’ Phil, the

“Barcoo” : How is this for a sheep-count-
ing record? I assisted to deliver 27,890 North-
ampton Downs wethers to Bullomon station at
Niridi Gully (Q.) in 1903. There had been trouble
over the previous drover’s delivery, and our boss
decided to declare his number when counting over.
To this end the sheep were boxed and counted off
camp the morning of the delivery. Result, 27,892,
and that number was declared when handing over
two hours later. The animals were then tallied over
in lots of 4000, and Ilalligan, the station overseer,
being indisposed, retired when the first lot had been
counted. A jackeroo who took on the job was a
failure as a counter, so a third man, a nephew of
the late C. B. Fisher, the original owner of the run,
took a hand anil counted sheep for sheep with the
drover to the finish. The count panned out 27,890.
It was then remembered that two sheep had been
caught for killing purposes after leaving camp that
morning. Consequently 55,782 jumbucks had been
counted in a few hours by one man, and counted
correctly.

THE vARIED PHASES OF BEER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
It was a bet ’twixt Brown and Jones.
Brown blatantly made claim
That he could order twenty beers
And never speak the name.
It was included in the bet
That never twice should he
Use any phrase. Conditions set,
We started on the spree.
. Commencing, Brown bespoke “A pot,”
And, next, “The same,” he said ;
Then “Ditto” ; and, to get a fourth,
“This time a bit more head.”
Then Jones protested, saying we
From bar to bar should run ;
“The same” and “ditto” was not fair.
• We scored the four as one.
Thence, passing on to other bars,
Brown ordered, first, “A mug,”
And then “A pint,” “Some amber juice,”
“Your nearest to a jug” ;
“Just something long and cool and wet,”
“A trifle from the cask,”
“A schooner,” and, to get the ninth,
“A quart is all I ask.”
And then he sought “A Tommy Dodd,”
“A little with a dash
Of gingerbeer,” “A simple glass,”
“Your best for threepence, cash.”
“Some yellow stuff,” “A length of froth,”
“A hop-juice,” “Drunkard’s tea,”
And striking then a pub we knew:
“The usual thing for me.”
“A mead of stagger,” then he craved;
And with “A pony one,”
He smiled triumphantly at Jones,
Claiming the deed as done.
Though Smith depreciated it—-
He said the name of beer
Had not at all been touched by Brown—
The others raised a cheer.
And though old Brown inclined to doubt
The deed as finished yet,
We promptly settled down to drink
The ten rounds of the bet.

Oh,
my Back!
All women suffer —some more than others —during some periods of their lives. Have you
ever stopped to think why this should he? Long-suffering women become so used to it as to
think that they must suffer for the rest of their natural lives. This is wrong. Most of this
suffering is absolutely unnecessary, and is in many cases due to kidney or bladder trouble-
nothing more. And you can prove it.
Kidney and bladder trouble is far commoner than most people would imagine. It is
reported that at least six out of every ten people who "go sick do so through kiduev disease
And, moreover, five out of every ten sufferers die from this same cause. If people only knew
how to tell whether their kidneys were diseased or not it would not be so bad, but thousands
upon thousands of men and women to-day are content to suffer and die in ignorance. W eak
kidneys lead to deadly Bright’s Disease in many cases.
Sure and Certain Symptoms of Kidney Trouble.
How are you to really recognise Kidney Trouble? Here is the way: —Have you a nasty
taste in the mouth the first thing in the morning, puffiness under the eyes, general feeling of
weakness and irritability, aches and pains in various parts of the body? Have you constipa-
tion. cloudy urine, or sharp stabbing or aching pains—a pain “as though my back will break '.
People who suffer from backache, rheumatism, gout, sciatica, gravel, stone, cystitis
(inflammation of the bladder), or pains in the muscles and joints, are all suffering these pains
through weak or diseased kidneys, for these are positively the symptoms of kidney trouble.
These signs of kidney or bladder trouble are caused by the poisonous acid in the blood
which the kidneys should remove, but they do not, owing to their bcing in a weak state. l)e
Witt’s Kidney and Bladder Pills quickly remove these symptoms. You should go to your
chemist at once for a box of De Witt’s Kidney and Bladder Pills, and prove for yourself that
within twenty-four hours these wonderful pills have without doubt commenced their healing
wor k Guaranteed. ■Do not put off, because weak kidneys very often means Bright’s Disease
in the end. But when you buy the pills be sure you get De Witt’s, in large white boxes printed
in blue and gold —with a blue wax seal on the top of the bottle. Refuse any of similar name
without this special seal.

“D.F.”: The war has brought Henry
.Tones and Co., whose Hobart (Tas.) jam
factory is the biggest south of the line,
orders from the British War Office for
about TOGO tons of jam ; but it put the
extinguisher on their idea of going into busi-
ness in California (U.S.A.). They picked
up some ’Murkan notions while they were
looking round ’Frisco, though, and one is
that canning vegetables ought to pay as well
in Australia as in TJ.S.A. They brought
back a stock of TTncle Sham’s favorite kinds
of peas, and if the local pea-producer takes
kindly to growing them .Tones and Co. are
going to can green peas *.fnr.- all they are
worth.
“Cripps Clark”: “NV.M.C.” (B. 23/9/’lo)'
relates how he once preached co-operative
shearing for sheep cockies —“one large shed,
one lot of cartage, one big lot sold in place
of a dozen small lots.” Every farmer, he
says, could see the advantages of the scheme,
but they didn’t co-op. Of course they
didn’t. .V co-operative wool-shed, to which
each member could in his turn bring his
sheep and shear them, is no new idea. It
was put into practice years ago. But halo-
ing and selling in one big lot is enough to
make any cocky smile. If jumbucks’ overcoats
were all alike it might be managed. But
some small holders, who run from 1500 to
3000 sheep, often top the market by the
careful culling of their flocks and classing of
their wool, whereas other cocky farmers run
only a few sheep of dubious parentage, whose
disreputable garments are not worth wasting-
time in sorting and classing. If that doesn’t
show “W.0.M.” the impossibility of his
scheme, lie’s in need of a specialist.

“Vigilans” : Mostly the old licensees con-
tinue in charge of the State pubs which are
to have a monopoly <>f the trade in the
Northern Territory. The Hotel Nictoria,
which was mothered by Mrs. Ryan, is to be
supervised bv James Bell, formerly of the
Club Hotel. ’ Donald Campbell takes the
Club, and Frank Knott the Terminus, in
Cavanagh-street, the Asiatic quarter of the
northern capital. S. Weedon, an old Terri-
torian, leaves the Pine Creek Australia to
Jimmie Cleary ; but McKeddie retains the
Katherine Menzies and Tom Crush the
Brock’s Creek Grand. No liquor can be im-
ported or sold except by the supervisor ot
the pubs. The penalty for an offence is ioUU
or 12 months in Fanny Bay. or some of both.
The experiment will be watched with interest
because for years the Chinese have defied the
authorities. Formerly every Chinese store-
keeper kept square gin or beer, which he
gave away as “cumshaw” or sold. White
cooks and waitresses arc. as far as possible,
to supersede the Chows now employed. I lie
wage for waitresses and chambermaids is to
be £lO per month and fares both ways it
they remain over a year; and that ought
to whistle up a supply.

Australia has established another world s
record. In the Victorian Journal of
Agriculture for September it is stated
that a Bed Poll cow, named Muria, has
lately given the highest authenticated yield
for one year of both milk and butter-fat
from a Bed Poll cow in any part of the
world. Also, Muria has given up the high-
est authenticated or recorded Australian
weight of butter-fat (8841 b.) for one year
from a cow of any breed. Opponents of
State Socialism will be .delighted to learn
that this goddess pursued her hobby under
State control, without special treatment, at
the Werribee (Vic.) Besearch Farm, and
that the best Private Enterprise record ot
butter-fat in Australia, for any breed, is a
mere 6401 b.

“T.W.A“Chug” (B. 7/10/T5) makes
the excellent suggestion that a list be pre-
pared of articles in common demand winch
are not made locally, with the idea of
quickening Australian manufactures. I beg
to nominate that the German jack plane be
placed on the list. It is cheaper and smaller
than the ordinary jack, and as a labor-saver
for rough work is universally recognised as
Al. Now that there is some difficulty in
obtaining the German article, I have known
carpenters make a substitute themselves.
The blade offers no difficulty; but Aus-
tralia is accused of having no wood durable
enough for this little glutton. Nonsense,
surely! What Germany has been able to
get in woods Australia can get. It is even
(piite likely that Australia has been supply-
ing the Blonde Beast with the necessary
ingredient.

“Moana” : A big postcard co. with a Ger-
hog flavor is doing some fine sweating here-
abouts. Its loug suit is selling Christmas
cards direct to the public through school-
children. The kid, who is trapped by
advertisement, gets three packets of post-
cards by return mail. There are three
grades. Two dozen are to be sold at a
penny, two dozen at 2d., and the other two
dozen at 3d. If the kid sells all the cards it
has 12s. in hand. It is allowed to retain
2s. as its share and has to forward the other
10s. to the co. But. if it doesn’t sell all the
cards it gets nothing. It has to return
the cards on hand and all the cash received.
As the unfortunate youngster usually finds
that it can’t get rid of all the 3d. cards it
is forced to work for the ravenous co for
nothing. Incidentally, some of the earth,

“Pariah": Some weeks ago I received a
letter bringing to my notice (say) a tooth
wash. As I continued to brush my snnle
supporters with charcoal there came another
let ter, which read something like this:
Since' we wrote to you last about our new dentifrice
we have had the honor of receiving the following note
from Hindu Kush, Grand Father and Sole Angola of
the Pamir Institute of Tripe Writers, iibet.
“Dear Sirs,—You may judge of my surprise at
learning from one of your circulars that chanced to
come this wav that the new dentifrice you speak ot
is the very preparation which I have used duiing
the past 200 years to remove the moss and other
foreign matter from the teeth of our acolytes. My
predecessor used the same stuff for upwards of .>OO
rears, and it was thought that the receipt was a
secret known only to this institution. Wishing you
and the molar juice the success you deserve, etc.
Of course I bought £25 355. llfd. worth,
and after the 827th application the corn dis-
appeared.
“Chug" : Speaking of the G.-G.’s idea of
the conservation of forests, why doesn t
somebody in the timber business fan his
patriotic* enthusiasm to the point of starting
a timber yard of selected Australian woods
fit for cabinet-.making and house decoration /
The ordinary tradesman goes on in the rut
of liis job using the imported woods lie
always used, but the numerous and pains-
taking amateur in handicrafts is. so
conservative. Every day in towns like Syd-
ney and Melbourne enthusiasts with the
saw and plane take home in small lots
an aggregate pf thousands of feet of timber
to work at in their spare time. If they
could obtain suitable Australian woods they
would use them for preference, and the
regular trade would learn their value in
due time from witnessing the amateur
demonstrations of their virtues as chair
legs and table tops. As things are now.
special Australian timbers are occasionally
written up in the press, but the only way
to obtain most of them Is to go into the
bush with an axe and cut them down. And
carrying an axe to Northern Queensland to
get the material for a bookshelf is a tedious

“F.H.” : A prohibition district whisky-jar
wouldn’t hold 1 per cent, of what the Vic-
torian Women’s National League doesn t
know about farming-for-females. At its
recent conference in Melbourne, the League
passed a resolution favoring the education
of women in rural occupations such as bee-
keeping, poultry-farming, the growing of
peanuts, asparagus and herbs,, with flowers
for decorative and scent-making purposes.
Bee-enthusiasts in Victoria are mostly on
fencing-jobs nowadays. Their bees are dead
and lioney is as high as Bj|d. a lb., what
there is of it. As for fowls, the past season
has been a miserable time for thousands of
women striving to make the price of a new
dress out of the egg-money. There are two
more or less payable methods of hen-rais-
ing. One is to grow pure-bred stock, and
after 15 years or so establish a reputation
as a stud-farmer. The other is to keep
poultry as a side-line on the farm. Peanut
farming has not yet been proved payable in
Vic., and just over the border has. been
proved very unpayable. Wheat-growing is
easier labor. Coaxing asparagus is work for
Titans. Herb-growing offers an income ot
fullv is.. 6d. a week to a hardworking
woman. Flower-raising has been made a
success by a few men, but is already an
overcrowded industry. As for scent-making,
let the scent-makers testify. Certain _Ol
these industries have been and are being
conducted by Australian women. But they
are mostly women of the kind who don t
know that the League exists; and general! v
they are backed up in their efforts by a
hefty, six-foot, ?,-h.p. farmer with corns on
his hands and a wide knowledge of working
bullocks, pigs, grain-growing and navvy-
work.

“Stay-at-Home”: Freely do I give the
tip. For months my best girl, who has a
brother in a gun-emplacement in Gallipoli,
has been sending him The Bulletin' every
week, hut it was always captured before it
reached tlic trenches. It seemed to have
about as much chance of escaping the hands
and eyes of the vigilant Australians as a
celluloid cat lias of being chased through
Tophet by an electric bulldog. Once seized
of this fact, the dear girl devised a lurk
■which makes Udo von Wedel’s strategy look
like a child’s illustrated alphabet. She wraps
the treasure in a good 'wowser organ -an
upright; religious paper which is balm to a
Wesleyan but weariness to a soldier. So
disguised the unregenerate rag reaches its
destination every time —which proves that
by choosing company wisely even a pagan
may proceed anywhere.

All the day my heart’s eye sees
Tall white irises, and bees
In a gauze of budding trees.
To this close, fly-haunted shop
Comes a red-faced woman. I lop !
Down she goes into a chair.
Drops her parcels everywhere,
Handkerchief and then her gloves :
And the chair creaks as she moves ;
Fans her loose, perspiring face. . . .
Leafy memories! Bring me grace
That 1 go without 'demur,
Waiting, with a smile, on her.
Why, when torrid rays beat down,
Must she wear a satin gown,
Black and very tightly laced
In about a bulging waist?
And why must she beg of me
One large pot of scalding tea
And a dripping, .buttered scone?

In a dream of gauzy trees,
Tall white irises. .. .and bees !

Is no more than a ghost, a myth;
And though he try
With “e” and “y”
To save himself from smothering,
Unmoved and cold, I watch him writhe
In agonies of dotibt as Smythe,
And d —n him heartily with Brown
For just another nameless clown.
And with their useless bones
I dump vile, endless .Tones I
But for a really joyous splash
Shout me the peerless name of Cash 1
It echoes glee
And solvency—•
A surname truly beautiful 1
It chinks and clinks and sweetly trills t
Cash registers and tellers’ tills
Break into music—ring and blare 1

When, with a rippling crash,
I hear the golden,

It is with a feeling of deep gratitude that I write
to tell you of the relief I got from using- your valu-
able remedy. I have been suffering severely for
some time with Eczema. I got treatment from two
doctors, several chemists and several patent medi-

to cure me. I was eventually recommended to try
your valuable skin cure. I got relief after the first
application, and now I am very pleased to say com-

may be in need of it. —Yours truly, M. J. HASSETT.

RHEUMATICS.
ABERDEEN LADY RELIEVED BY DR.
MORSE’S INDIAN ROOT PILLS
AFTER OTHER TREATMENTS
FAILED.
“I was in the hospital as a great sufferer
from rheumatics,” writes Mrs. Mary
Roughan, of Aberdeen, N.S.W. “After being
in that institution for a month I repaired
to my home, and save whilst under the treat-
ment I never felt actually freed from this
complaint. I was induced to try Dr. Morse’s
Indian Root Pills seeing the wonderful way
they helped my husband, who suffered with
indigestion. I am pleased to say that after
a very short course of Dr. Morse’s Indian
Root Pills I was completely restored to
health, and I cannot speak too highly of
this medicine. So bad was I when taken away
to the hospital with rheumatics, it affected
me all over and I was helpless, as neighbors
know. You can publish this testimony with
my full permission.”*

BITRATE OF TAR STOPS COUGHS
AND COLDS.
HELPFUL HINT BY A SPECIALIST.
Coughs, colds, catarrh and throat and
bronchial troubles are nearly always indi-
cations of an inflamed or abnormal condition
of the mucous lining of the throat and nasal
and bronchial passages; and this inflamma-
tion or abnormal condition must be remedied
before the trouble will disappear. Recen*
tests show that bitraie of tar exercises a
peculiarly soothing and healing effect on
these tissues, and it is doubtless because of
this action that coughs, colds, catarrh and
bronchial troubles so quickly disappear fol-
lowing its use. The best way to use bitratc
of tar is to add two ounces of it to a plain
syrup made by dissolving half a pound of
sugar in half a pint of hot water. Mix
thoroughly and take one or two tablespoon-
fuls every hour until the trouble disappears.
Because of its tonic and food properties this
syrup will be found particularly strengthen-
ing and beneficial to those who have been
weakened and run down by chronic coughs.
Care should be taken to ask your chemist
for the genuine Htrate of tar, which con-
tains in addition to pine tar such valuable
remedial agents as guaiacol, wild cherry, oil
of pine and menthol, each of which possesses
therapeutic properties of the highest value.*
POLITICAL
POINTS
Lawyer Maurice Blackburn, M.L.A., whom
the Akgus lias been attempting to placard
as a pro-German, was lately hailed by a
Tory weekly as the real leader of the Vic.
Labor party. He isn’t, and probably never
will he. It seems scarcely likely that Labor
at large will forget Blackburn’s early con-
nection with the Red-Raggers when he and
11. H. Champion (Vida Goldstein’s brother-
in-law ) used to try to keep the little party
oil a high intellectual plane. Not long before
Blackburn reached the Assembly there was
a smash-up of the Socialist organisation, and
one limb mortified and fell off. Blackburn
still remained a part of tlie parent concern,
but his acceptance of P.L.C. principles
enabled him to grab the opportunity for
popping into Parliament when Watt’s Essen-
don seat became vacant. It is a muddled
business —particularly in view of the fact
that the self-styled Socialist of the red-flag
breed is fond of referring to the Australian
in khaki as Willie Mug, while the Lahorites
who sent Blackburn to Parliament have been
flocking to the Front. Blackburn ought to
chuck liis old pals for good, or else tell the
Labor party that its platform isn’t what he
thought it was when he signed on.
A CHAMPION.
ANANLAS: “I say, old man, you might let
me out for a week or two!"
DEVIL: “What for?"
ANANIAS : “I want to go and shake hands
with the chap who writes the war
news.”
There's an occasional laugh to be got out
<>f A- S. Wales Assembly, anyway. The
other night G. R. W. McDonald (Bingara)
and_ Jabez Wright (Willyaniaj provided it
during an explanation as to why they had
left the Chamber without saluting the
Speaker:—
Wright: The hon. member made the statement
that my constituents wanted beer and not water. I
was so incensed at that reflection on their character
that I called him a damned snob, and he rushed
down the passage before I could catch him... .1 am
only human. I am not alabaster. I am a human
being with all the human instincts.
Fitzpatrick: The trouble is that you could not
travel as quickly as the hon. member.
Wright: No. I could not. But, perhaps, that is
all for the best.... Had I made obeisance to the
Chair he would have, got further away than he did.
Then McDonald denied that he had made
the beery suggestion, Dick Meagher gave
both lion, members a certificate for courtesy
and the show was over.
Whatever tlie sins of the Peacock Gov-
ernment, no one can say it has wholly neg-
lected tlie encouragement of rural indus-
tries. Certainly it lias done nothing to con-
serve the State’s remaining forests ; nor has
it encouraged afforestation; nor has there
been anything but more talk about the
handling of wheat iu bulk; nor has it done
anything towards promoting co-operative
gristing mills, so that the farmer would be
independent of the big millers and the bigger
wheat-buyers. But it has taken strides in
tlie small side-lines that don’t matter tup-
pence. For instance, there is a large orchard
at Burnley where experiments of use to the
State might be carried out, but Nunawading
orchardists laugh as they pass it on their
way home from market, forgetting that they
have to help to pay for the costly joke. And
if still continues its amusing egg-laying com-
petitions. Also, an apiculturist has been
appointed, and he demonstrates about bees,
their manners and morals, how to feed them,
at what stage they should be weaned, and
so forth. It is all very instructive, and the
man on the land should feel immensely grate-
ful for the interest the State takes in his
affairs.
SUFFER LITTLE CHILDREN, etc., etc.
HANS (to enemy suckling): “Gome dis
nay, mine leedle tarling! Kaiser Vil-
heim he say, ‘Remember alvays ....
vomens undt children fairsdt!' ”
The Defence Department made a joyful
noise the other morning because the manu-
facture of the leather portion of the infan-
tryman’s equipment has been undertaken in
the Commonwealth. “The leather is soft,
and carries a good finish, and is held to be
a great improvement on the imported equip-
ment. The great advantage in the change
is, of course, that the factory has unlimited
raw material to work upon.” It is really
wonderful how the Government finds out
things. For over 12 months, apparently,
the Government of one of the great hide-
growing countries of the world has been
importing leather belts for its army; and
now it professes to be quite astonished at
the excellence of the stuff that Australia
could have supplied itself with all the while.
Instead of making the joyful noise, suppose
somebody finds out what bad, stinking-fish
Australian it was who was responsible for
using imported stuff previously.
“Copabella” says lie will swear to every
line of this: —
As most of my lady customers favor “Never-A gain”
leagues, I naturally sell a lot of eheap-however-
sweated lines. One of these is a glass bedroom lamp
at Is. “Lamps to sell at a bob?” said Iloheniohe’s
traveller. “No hope ! Extra freights—war risks—
enemy trading! All that puts the stopper on shilling
lamps!” He had, however, a job line of glass fonts
(the part that holds the oil), German-made, with
out-of-date collars (that’s the brass ring the burner
fits in), and he would sell them cheap. Now I had
to have shilling lamps somehow —and anything so
intricate as a lamp is not made in Australia. I
therefore took the old fonts, made in Germany:
fitted new collars, made in England, with plaster-of-
paris, imported from Norway; added a burner, made
in America; a wick, made in India; a glass, made
in Austria; marked them with a tie-on tag, made
in France, writing with a pencil made in Bavaria.
Wrapped up in brownpaper, made (I believe) in
Sweden, filled with kerosene made in Java, and
lighted with a match made in Japan, they were a
creditable All-Australian production, and, labor not
“costed,” just cleared themselves at Is.! The next
week Kioto’s man offered me bedroom lamps at 2ld.
each ; everything—wick, burner, globe, font and
futuro-eubist decorations —made in Japan. So an-
other promising Australian industry slumped with a
dull, cold slump. By the way, have they “Never-
Again” leagues in Japan—or just a tariff?
The poor Australian youngster catches it
in the neck every time. The N. S. Wales
Auditor-General has now reported that the
State Railway Superannuation Fund is get-
ting in a precarious condition. Of
course it is. Five or six years ago,
when the sinful thing was being
offered as a bribe by the Liberals, The
Bulletin, backed by professional actuaries,
warned the Government that the thing must
go smash. The scheme proposed to do for
14 per cent, of salaries what it had been
proved could not be done for 4 per cent.
The wicked part of the business is that the
oldsters of the service, who drop in for their
superannuation early, will get all that they
are entitled to and a great deal more, but
EXPLAINED.
THE STUDENT: "Fader, vhy did Nero fiddle
vliile Pome vas burning?”
THE OLD MAN : “I s'pose he had taken out
an insurance policy the day before .”
when those who are now kids in the service
turn up, the cupboard will he bare. The
longer the scandal is allowed to last the
more injustice will be done; and the sooner
a practising actuary is called in to bring
benefits into line with contributions the less
robbery will the scheme be responsible for.
“Sandbags,” from the edge of a hot spring
in Maoriland: —
Thank Heaven, there is still a gleam of humor in
tlie land, and it falls in a bright shaft across this
“National” Government of ours. Massey and Ward sit
contentedly eheek-by-jowl—two hearts that beat as
one at last—and their bald heads, seen from the
press gallery, have an effulgence all their own.
Massey remarked the other day that an Imperial
Conference might be called at any moment, and
that when the bell rang he and Ward would pro-
bably go off together. Naturally the hacks at once
remarked that Billenjo would make “an excellent
STICKING TO HIS PAL.
CIVILIAN : “Gam! What 'ate you got to
fight for, anyhow?"
HIS MATE: “Why, you, of course .”
combination.” Of course, if Joe went alone he
would get all the limelight, and if Bill went alone
he would have to leave Joe behind to mind the
cheese, and—well, it’s just as well to be on the safe
side. Joe may be fond of cheese. Meanwhile the
local editors are busy boxing the compass, and the
few lone citizens who think that individuality, even
in polities, is a good thing are wearing a worried
look.
There were two candidates, both .Liberals,
foi’ the seat in the Tas. Assembly left vacant
when N. K. Ewing dropped the leadership
of the Liberal party for a seat on the Bench.
One was Alec Ilean, who put up a record
for the State by holding the job of Minister
of Lands for eight years on end; the other
was Dan Ryan,' a municipal magnate. Both
put themselves in the hands of the executive
of the Liberal League on the understanding
that if it would save the expense of an elec-
tion only one should nominate, but that if
any other candidate came along both should
have a run. The League dropped the ex-
Minister in favor of Ryan, who was the only
candidate nominated.
What is liable to happen to a country
which drags its necessaries from overseas
was learnt by the
Commonwealth Gov-
ernment in connection
with a shipment of
2500 tons of rails for
the trans-continental
railway. The goods
were shipped at Mid-
dlesborough (Eng.)
away back in June.
3914; but when the
Clan Macmillan, which
carried them, reached
Capetown she was re-
quisitioned as a trans-
port for Botha’s army.
So the rails for one
of Australia’s two
great strategical work-
were dragged back-
wards and forwards
many more miles, and
only arrived in Aus-
tralia a week or two
ago. That’s the sort
of country that makes
things easy for the enemy’s strategists.
There is to be a sudden outburst of fizz,
and chicken and Cocked Hat and special train
in connection with the trial of a third-rail
device at Tocumwal (N.S.W.). Of course,
if four imported Governors have to be sum-
moned from their toilsome job of attending
concerts to gaze impressively at a locomotive
rushing out of Tocumwal, it is a fair thing
that they should he given a snack; hut there
seems no obvious reason for spending cash on
a general jollification. Two or three plain
men in overalls who knew their job could
settle the merits of the scheme in a couple of
hours, and as Cocked Hats and politicians
must iu the end rely on the judgment of
such men, it looks as if this Big Eat has
been scheduled out of its turn.
THE LOGIC OF VICTORY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
We have managed so far without a Greater Sydney
Biff. .. .and we can go on in the same way until tlie
war is over.— Sydney Telegraph.
Dirty, congested, slipshod, systemless,
The spreading city blunders on her way.
Her ragged suburbs iu confusion press,
Like unwashed urchins, round her skirts all day.
Uncombed, unkempt, and quite beyond control,
They smear her with foul fingers while they laugh;
Thus have we “managed so far,” and the whole
Arrangement seems to suit the Telegraph.
Our dream was of a slipper and a tub.
To bring io order the unruly ci'ew,
Wallop it into system, wash and scrub,
And deck it out in garments fresh and new.
But this is war-time, and plain dirt should stay,
They tell us, till the blood of strife is dry.
What patriot hand would dare to clear the way
Of ragged muddle while our soldiers die?
Let things remain exactly as they are,
Let every one sit down or calmly sleep;
If we have managed to get on so far,
The work we ought to .do will surely keep.
Let us be dirty, slipshod and unkempt,
Employ six men to do the work of one,
So shall our hands be stronger to attempt
More warlike deeds than those we yet have done.
It follows as the day must follow night,
As sure as two is four's unquestioned half,
That war’s success is based on reasoning bright
Like that which glitters in the Telegraph.
And though all roads perchance may lead to Home,
One only path to victory is trod —-
By keeping matters in a mess at home
Our boys will make a mess of Turks abroad.
x.s.w.

A PRAYER FOR THE IDEAL.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Mr. Chauneey M. Depew said the Anglo-French
loan was an ideal celebration of the century of
Anglo-American peace.— Cable.
Thanks be to Chauneey M. Depew
For thus concreting Peace;
May dahlars and the lOU
Begin and never cease!
May his sublime conception spread
From frozen Pole to Pole,
Until the idea is inbred
J n every simple soul!
The ancient things are passed away,
The ancient methods changed ;
Odes, statues, feasts have had their day
As signs of Peace ’ arranged.
Fireworks and fetes and friendly jousts
Are rightly held effete ;
Your modern eelebrator boosts
New bonds in Loansome Street.
The nations’ quarrels are composed—
Commemorated, too—
Where mortgages are oft foreclosed
And little loans put through.
The devotees of Peace give vent
To their surpassing joy
By charging, all in, six per cent.—
That’s peeziness, my poy !
It does not matter very much
To Chauneey M. Depew
If English, German, French or Dutch

SPORTING
NOTIONS
lhis years Caulfield Cup result was
unique in so far that three imported horses filled
notrm aCeS ’ no , one of them appeared to be
nearly as sound as the proverbial bell. For rather
more than a mile the race was a matter of Burraba-
deen ieadmg a little from either William the Silent
rvi i l 1 '!’, Wlth Pnnce Bardolph, Lav'endo and
following next, and 10 other horses more or
less out of it they remained out of it to the end.
But a marked change came to the order of the fore-
most six when they had gone nine furlongs. Burra-
badeen proved to be a comparative commoner. The
iavorite had shot his bolt, and William the Silent
passed him Then Garlin tried to beat William, but
nll V T . lie 'y were still struggling, Cyklon
challenged the pair, and then little Dempsey brought
ine handy Lavendo along on the outside, With some-
thing of a rush, and won by a length from the
persevering William. Garlin, who just failed to stav
out’ was , about a length and a quarter behind
William and a neck behind Cyklon, who got third
r, i a °e-...Jt nuts for Dempsey, after being taken
off William the Silent on account of his failure in
the Metropolitan, td get the mount on the gee that
beat the same luckless animal this time.
Whv did William go back in the betting
to 33 s and 2os on the course? Well, he was
the lamest duck m the birdcage. Lame fore and
ait. He limped stiffly on one bind leg, and walked
gingerly on one foreleg. It seemed 1000 to 1 against
William running such a fine race as he did—a race
that would make him out to be a real good thing
tor the Melbourne Cup if he were certain to stand
a fair amount of work in the meantime. But neither
lie nor Lavendo is at all certain to be capable of
being kept up to the mark until November 2. They
were both in harder nick than Cyklon, but again
unh the grandson of Carbine the question of sound-
ness has to be considered. There is easily room for
improvement, but a horse must be galloped into
condition.
The Caulfield Cup disappointments were Reputa-
tion and Patrobas rather than Burrabadeen, who
was at least a pacemaker for two-thirds of the
journey. The other two nags finished fifth and
sixth, and had never been any nearer the front than
that. Patrobas, perhaps, is hardly “class” enough
IC PP a Cup horse, and qs for the excuse that lie is a
difficult customer for ;i small hoy to manage—well,
the same trouble will present itself in thfe Mel-
bourne Cup. Reputation is “classy” enough, surely.
The black Maorilarider was the lit tip dandy of the
party on Saturday, and seemed in danger of becom-
ing too fine ere the V.R.C. meeting.
To the present writer’s way of thinking, nothing
weighted above Bst. 51b. has a great chance to win
the Melbourne Cup this year. Carlita (Bst. 51b.) is
top-weight among the most probable ones. Lower
down on the list there are about a dozen with
respectable claims to consideration, including Wal-
lace Isinglass, who is possibly as good a tlnee-year-
old as his owner thinks him. But he would, of
course, need to be exceptionally brilliant to win the
Cup in a year when -o many older horses of proved
merit are in the middle-weight division.
After his had performance in the Eclipse
Stakes on the Wednesday of the Caulfield meeting
William the Silent wore a decidedlv sick and sorrv
appearance. Looking at weary William as he stood
ruminating in his stall in the birdcage, after being
rubbed down and bandaged, no one would have sus-
pected him of having scored three wins and a second
1 for the Metropolitan) within.the previous month.
The change from Sydney to Melbourne had seemingly
disagreed with the auburn-haired creature. What-
ever may have been the matter the hooks got wind
of it beforehand. Touts told them that William
was “sore,” hut he was not so perceptibly sore as
the punters who had taken 6 or 7 to 1 about him on
the strength of his running at Randwick.
Frank Dempsey, a lad of 16 years, has
jumped into the limelight as a jockey. Fifteen
months ago he won a race at Alburv (N.S.W.), and
since then he has passed the post' first 28 times,
finishing up with the Caulfield Cup. His natural
weight is fist. 21b. Few turf careers have been so
meteoric, and, by the bye, the same may be said of
his Caulfield mount, Lavendo.
* * .v.
Jockey R. Lewis lias had an unlucky run
on Caulfield Cud mounts. Last week’s was the' 16th.
and third is the nearest he has got to success—
once on Ballistite (1899), again Emir (1904), and
last week on Cyklon.
* * * *
“Sheila”: Irish and Irish-Australian
horsemen were very much in the picture at the
recent Randwick meeting. Foley (Lady Minnie)
Paddy Nolan (Ickle Lass) and Paddy Ryan (Tar-
pan) trained three out of the six winners. At Caul-
lield Prank McGrath trained first and second nags in
the two-year-old race, and young Frank Dempsey
rode the Cup winner. Members of the United Irish
League celebrated these victories by making a pre-
sent of their cash to Ivillarney bookmakers Dinny
O’Galilee and Michael Jerusalem.

‘‘The Seer”: Billy Brew (“Renegade”),
who does the sporting page for Kalgoorlie Mixer,
put up a somewhat unique performance the other
week-end in his turf fixtures. On Saturday for
the Belmont Park (W.A.) service he tipped the first
three horses as they ran in each of the first two
races—Hurdle (12 starters) and Trial Stakes (18
starters). This he followed on Monday by nominat-
ing correctly the A.J.C. Metropolitan place-fillers in
a field of 28. Minor successes in his Saturday selec-
tions were three winners for the Goldfield R.C. meet-
ing and a similar number for the first A.J.C. day.
But he erred slightly in placing Derby horses thus:
Wallace Isinglass', 1 ; Cetigne, 2 ; Westcourt, 3.
South Aus., like England, has had a “War
Derby,” the classic event being for the first time run
at Victoria Park. It was won easily by Perambu-
late, bought as a yearling in Sydney by It. E. H.
Hope, of the S.A..T.C. committee. For the Morphett-
ville Plate, however, a supposed good thing came
undone, Mostvn Owen's Marmur being only third.
A. E. Hamilton’s Bourlang (Bezonian —Nerve) won.
Second and third in this race and second and both
thirds (dead-heat) in the Derby were all Pistols.
Perambulate is, of course, a Perambulator colt. The
tote gave itself a big advertisement in a small
race on Derby day, paying £62 on a winner, and
having enough left to hand out £2 6s. and £7 ss".
to dead-heating seconds.
A heated question was asked in South Aus. Parlia-
ment about the line drawn between soldiers at the
races on Derby day. All men in uniform were in-
vited bv the S.A.J.C., but only officers were admitted
to the stand and lawn, non-coms, and men being kept
to the half-crown enclosure. As things go in these
war times the privates include many sons of Club
members, and there was a general rumpus. “Tommy”
Ryan, in the Assembly, quoted Kipling on the in-
dignities heaped on the other Tommy—-“but it’s
savior of his country when the guns begin to shoot.”
Everybody promptly repudiated responsibility for
the restriction. The S.A.J.C. claimed to have acted
on a direct request from the military. Sandford,
military Commandant, said that the rule dated from
a time before his arrival in S.A., and he had no
sympathy with it. On the second day of the meet-
ing it was dropped, and Tommy went where he
pleased.
HAPPY EYRE.
Manly (N.S.W.)
life-saver, dons a
new costume.
Sydney “unregistered” racing was in the
boom-stage at Ascot last week. Nineteen events,
which used up 6 hours smin. of daylight, were
necessary to push the meeting through. " Punters
however, entered no protest. “Not likely,” as
Shaw s character says, with 13 first favorites land-
ing home.
St. Carwyne, winner of the Metropolitan,
was drawn in Tattersall's sweep by a small syndi-
cate in Methven (M.L.). This tiny township clings
by its eyebrows to. one boundary of the famous
“dry” district of Ashburton, and consists mostly of
pubs with gigantic bars, so that the frantic tourist
who has accumulated a raging thirst in Ashburton
can be quickly served and his life saved when he
arrives hurriedly in pursuit of moisture in a hired
motor-car. Tt is a toss-up which is tffc most re-
munerative type of business in these parts—running
a puli on the boundary or a fleet of fast
cars from Ashburton to the boundary pubs. The
reader will be able to gather from the foregoing some
idea of what kind of a night tliev had at Methven
when the news got about that £5OOO was heading
towards the township.
This at the Warwick (Q.) races the other
day; The mile was won by Rumos and the bettors
with the bookies gaily collected 10 to one. While
they were thus enjoying themselves bettors with the
tote pranced around and lifted a dividend of
'' fO its. id. on Rumos. and 16s. lid, on Vivas the
second horse. Somebody said that Ike Noses blushed,
but that can be put down to idle rumor. No insur-
ance on that kind of fire.

“C. Inky”: Gracie Waugh, who rode a
pony bareback and unbridled from Melbourne to
Sydney some time ago, is now riding over the
jumps at country shows in northern Victoria. She
is only 18,. and cuts a natty figure astride her mount
attired in a white jockey-costume. She is fearless
and dashing, and rode Jim Robins's string with
success at Rochester. At tiie Bendigo Show she put
up an Australian record jump for lady riders In-
taking her horse over the bar- at 6ft. 7in.
C- G. Dalgety, of Christchurch (M.L.),
seems to have another money-maker in his stable in
Warstep’s half-brother Snub. This Martian—Lady
Disdain gelding has started twice, in the Braemar
Handicap at Ashburton a week or so back and in
the Dunedin Guineas early this month, and the
bacon was never in doubt on either occasion. With
this nag and Warstep and the new filly Disdainful
(who won the Dunedin Stakes) deacon Dalgety
should have to part with a weighty cheque for in-
come tax at the end of the season.
When the Court at Dubbo (N.S.W.) had
last week finished dealing with charges of con-
spiracy arising, out of the . scale-faking business- re*-
veaied at the Coonamble racecourse, the Judge
handed Janies Maloney three years’ hard. Janies had
tough luck. He might have got off if he hadn’t been
found under the floor of the weighing-room accom-
panied by a. hag of tools, four chunks of iron, an
assortment of lead, a pair of scales, a revolver and
a piece of wire with a hook on each end. There
was also the slightly incriminating circumstance that
a hole was in the floor directly under the. official
weighing machine. Therefore the Court put two and
two together, and as James couldn't explain what
business he was carrying on in his dug-out, up he
went. Next time a strange horse carrying 12st. 101 b.
on the official programme and a jock scaling sst.
611 b. on its back starts at 50 to 1 in a big race
out West and wins by half a street, the clerk of the
scales is going to push a long bayonet into the floor
underneath his machine and listen very attentively
for a yell. If there is no yell lie Will guess that no
James Maloney is there.
Webb’s victory over Hannan for the
Maoriland sculling championship hgg sharpened his
appetite for fame and its twin, cash. Charlie Towns,
of Sydney, is the mark which the Wanganui oars-
man now has his eye upon, and if an arrangement
can be arrived at the championships of M. If. and
N.S.W. will probably go with the.. purse. Prelim-
inary wrangles as to where the race shall take place
and the amount of exes, to be allowed the sculler
who crosses the Tasman may be expected to break
out at an early date.
Another good showing. Of a total mem-
bership of 2338 in the Maoriland Rowing Associa-
tion no. less than 1005 men have pulled out for the
Front. Naturally, the annual championship events
have been abandoned.

Lieut. W. It. Maee, killed at the Darda-
nelles, made the eighth Sydney Rowing Club member
to fall in the Great War. lie was a splendid type
of athlete, over 6ft. high, and, besides being an
excellent oarsman, was a fine footballer.
English cruiser-weight Reeve, who had
found the woodener he got from McGoorty so stimu-
lating that he forthwith fled to Melbourne and out-
pointed Joe Bonds, sped back to Sydney last week,
and on Saturday faced Fritz Holland at the Stadium.
And a real good battle they fought. Reeve, who had
a stone and a half more of himself than Holland, is
exceptionally quick-footed for a big man, and in his
elude way rather smart at evading the punch which
hurts. Fritz was after a knock-out, and didn’t land
it, partly because Reeve badly bothered him with a
stiaight left, but mainly because Reeve was missing
from the old address. Twice, however, the goods
W'ere partly delivered, and for a few' seconds on
each occasion the Englishman was swaying on the
brink; but Fritz “sniffed a kid” and held his fire
while Reeve woke up, and for sheer thankfulness at
being on his feet .fought back with the wide grin of
gratitude. While Fritz was finessing round for
the jaw, Reeve was piling up a lot of points, and at
the end had a good margin. Of course H
referee’s decision . to that effect was hooted’ but
Bakeiwwas unquestionably right. ‘Si ’''

Fred Ivay’s resemblance to Spring-keeled
Jack balked Herb McCoy of tile welterweigjit vic-
toiy at Melbourne Stadium on Caulfield Cup night.
Holding his right glove for McCoy to smell, the awk-
ward left-hander would slam over a left-cross or a
villainous uppercut and then hop to distant parts.
He regarded McCoy as most undesirable company. In.
at least six of the rounds the latter hardlv touched
the spring-heeled party, but he found opportunities
in the other sessions of sneaking in under the elu-
sive guard and bombarding tile enemy’s commis-
sariat. Nevertheless, it wasn’t till the sixteenth
round when Kay began to sag, that McCoy was
able to plant bis right to the head with any sin-
cwin. But his efforts didn’t sufficiently impress
t ic referee, who opined, at the finish, that Kay was
iho better man. When the crowd recovered its
breath it seemed as if it would tear the premises up
by the roots and present them to the judge one at a
time. And the language? It could only be em-
bossed on chilled steel!
*.* * *
“Bash” ; Iu regard to the weight of pngs
generally and McGoorty in particular. How much
weight can be put on by a man like this betwee
1 o clock in the afternoon and 8.30 in the evenino-’
Dots anyone know? Really know, I mean; I don’t
want the variegated information at the disposal of
the crowded tramc-ar and the saloon bar. 1 have
beard “two or three pounds” mentioned ; also “nine
or ten.’ Judging by the amount of haggle about
weighing in, the possibilities connected with eight
hours feed and sleep must be fairly substantial
Hoes anyone know what these are? If so, let him
kiss the Book and give evidence.
. course, this business of weighing in boxers
eight oi nine hours before they collide is wildly
absurd, llie elements thus introduced into the ring
are not altogether different from those which might
be imported into the race for the Melbourne Cup if
the jocks were weighed before breakfast. Considera-
tions of; justice to the public and to other boxers
demand that every time an argument takes place
with gloves the weights announced should be those
the men fight at. When the weights proclaimed are
the weights the men were not prepared to bring into
the ring, what on earth is the use of having, stan-
dard weights for different classes or of weighin'- tile
men at all?
* * * *
John I*. ; Frank Slavin has stepped into
the ring again—“somewhere in France.” The famous
old pug. enlisted recently at Victoria (8.C.), where
be has been living since he returned from the Klon-
dike; hut how he managed to pass Heaven only
knows, for he was born at Maitland (N.S.W.) nearly
-)4 years ago. Slavin’s most sensational scrap was at
the Ormonde Club, London, when lie put Joe
-McAuhfte, the Californian Giant, to sleep in the
second round; his best exhibition was in Dollarland,
when he stopped Jake liilrain in nine rounds (some
time before liilrain stood up to the mighty John L
Sull'van for ? 5 rounds ) ; and bis greatest' fight and
Waterloo was on May 30, 1892, in the Big Smoke
when, after a classic contest with Peter Jackson, lie
was outed in the 10th round.
De Resta has clone it at last ! Early in
September, on the new wooden motor-track at
Chicago, hey succeeded in driving 100 miles in
competition inside the hour. It happened in a 100
rY n - Challenge race, which he haggled in 58min
54 2-ssec. De Resta, Cooper, Burman and Oldfield
started and the result was in doubt until the 96tli
rmle, when Oldfield’s carburetter went on strike.
The other three all had tyre troubles, De Resta
having to stop for a new cover at 74 miles. After
a hair-raising finish lie beat Cooper by 52sec., with
Burman three minutes away. The average pace
works out at 101 miles an hour, which” is the
worlds best in competition. But the 100 miles
lias been annihilated quicker against time. Goux,
the French crack, has whizzed over 106 miles 88T
yards in 60min., and Chassaque has shoved a 12-
cvlinder Sunbeam to 107 miles. 1672 yards in the
hour.

A. J. Lewis put up a great ride in win-

Watson whirled over the distance in 2hr. 29min

The cash scattered in U.S.A. < through
motoring is staggering. The ears registered reached
the two million mark last June, and they devour in a
year about a (Yankee) billion gallons of netrol -u ~
eost of £26,000,000, and £1,1)00,000 worth of bihri
.eating oil. Then they, require over 12 million tvre<
costing £a8,00<>,000; use accessories to the t urn
of £20,000,000; and garage charges, repairs and
replacements account for another £6O 000 000 <?iv
ing a total running cost of £140,000,000,’ an’aver-
age ot £73 per car per year. Then 600,000 new
cais are made and sold m a year, and if these ire
reckoned at only £l5O eacli it means another
£90,000,000 Add this to the cost of running and
it is found that in U.S.A. alone the motor industry
is responsible for making £2,16.000.000 whir round
m a year. uiiu
, a ' vn Tennis Association chose (or
had forced upon it) a’singularly bad time to come
before the public for a new lease of a piece r , f ,
Adelaide Park-lands. ft has had bad luck ever
since, two years ago, it found the 11 courts allowed
it on the Oval by the Cricket Association not en ml?
and signed a lease from the City Corporation of five
acres away on South Terrace. The seasons have been
ioo dry to plant new lawns. Hence nothing w
been done, and the present idea is to 'exchange the
hve acres for a smaller area right alongside the
O y al on North Terrace, so that the two affair® mav
be run without double-banking expenses of manage
ment. But also this is no time to face a meetin«-
ot ratepayers—which was legally necessary askim"
for public land for sporting purposes. The peonle
who want to keep the park lands open registered the
usual objection, and stern citizens made remarks
about racquets and rifles —though the S.A.L T A has
sent a fine assortment of its players to the Front
already—and finally it was agreed to cancel the
former lease and say nothing about a fresh one till
things are different in Europe.
, Bui,silicon are getting into form in Svdnev
early m the season, although lacking the zest that
comes from rivalry in grade competitions J„ the
opening innings of the second round of “off” mimes
commenced on Saturday there were four three-ifiuirv
scores, most of the displays being bright, confident
cricket. Heading- the list was Smith, who made 177
for North Sydney against Middle Harbor in an
innings of 427—the record for the afternoon Next
came Foster’s 122 for lledfern against Sydney *Tfi
rest of the team made 59, and old friend Sundries
tailed off with 26. Davis batted up 120 for Waverier
agUinst Petersham; and Macartney, for Gordon
against Glebe, got 105 in good style.
Private advices announce the death in
Gallipoli of Dr. C. J. Tozer, who, besides playin"
first-grade cricket and football for Sydney Univer-

Hileen Lee, the 10-year-old daughter of a
lock-keeper at Teddington (Eng.), has just put up a
fine swimming performance by doing the 7| miles in
the Thames between Tower-bridge and Putney in an
hour and 58 minutes. She then continued* on to
Richmond, and returned to Kew bridge, a total of
21f _ miles. The girl was in the water for 6hr.
38min., and wound up strongly. Durir. ;• the trip
she. rested occasionally for a little food. Her .best
effort previously was a 16-mile swim in 4| hours,
also in the Thames.
N.S.W. Fisheries Department is making
an effort to keep the trout streams well stocked.
The just-completed distributions of fry totalled
95,800, split up between western, 20,000 northern,
35,600 ; southern, 34,200 ; retained at hatchery,
6000. It goes on the slate as a record liberation
for N. S. Wales ; and with reasonable luck it should
make the streams worth angling within a couple of
years.

Randolph Bedford calls for a hearing:—-
I rise for a personal explanation. Some miscreant
, seems to have adopted my name as a spiritual lec-.
turer, and I get letters ..like this:—
The Psyehometry Association desires to know if
Mr. Bedford will lecture and give manifestations at
any date he may mention. We presume that Mr.
Bedford secures spirit messages.
A Melbourne firm of stockbrokers wrote:—
If you haye any good spook tips will you pass
them on to us? We particularly wish to know (1)
hen? will the war end# (2) Are Edna Mays good
buying? .p?y Will y©ii really strike oil in South
Australia ?
A bank manager writes, inter alia: —
If you can’t get any really good market tips, : you
might be able to get a message about your overdraft.
A bad man from Wynyard (Tas.) :
What next? I hear you are a spirit medium, tell-
ing the gulls what their dead uncle; mean to leave
them in their wills. I wish you could give me a
lead over in this forsaken hole, and tell me some-
thing about replacement deposits and the develop-
ment of crystal facets. I am tired of the splashes
and stringers of chalcopyrite, and want to strike it.
•lust exercise your occult powers, and we will stand
in together.
This is getting too strong. Some fool newspaper
published it as a news item, and exchanges are
printing the old lie, and each adds a new one. If
the spiritualistic expert who has pinched my name
continues in his wickedness I may provide a new
spook for his circle —if there is any justice or
cyanide left in the land.

The co. did very well to get as close as that
to the figures for the corresponding part of
1914. (In running the eye down the column,
don’t, by the way, overlook the fact that the
first two lines represent the results of a
year each.) Making money in the timber
trade during the past five or six years has
been as easy as .sin. Practically the only
difference between timber merchants is that
some have their profits in hard cash or con-
vertible assets, while others have theirs in
stocks of timber, and stocks of timber are
not too easily pushed off just now. Yet
they are a good deal more easily pushed off
at present than they will be when the borrow-
ing orgy stops and we start the painful pro-
cess of cleaning the slate. This and other
timber cos. are going to have a dull time
then. In previous slack periods some of the
firms (especially those, like this one, with
country sawmills) have made bread and
butter by exporting hardwoods for sleepers,
girders and piles. Apart from the fact that
timber for these purposes isn’t so easily got
as it was a few years ago, there is a doubt
whether Governments will look kindly upon
further shipments of these things, since
export means paying more for the goods
wanted for local Government works. One
way and another, therefore, things don’t
look very cheerful for cos. in this business,
once the present desperate struggle to keep
loan works going comes to an end. So far
as Ellises are concerned, they are in the
favorable position of having very small lia-
bilitiesj the whole lot amounts to only
£20,945, which is more than covered by book
debts —largely, no doubt, owing by Govern-
ments and all collectible within a month or
two. S locks are down to £19,163 ; and
that’s a good feature, too, because there is
going to be a pronounced shrinkage of values
presently.

While the Hydro Electric Co. (Tas.,) hopes
to raise a breath of hv’ by making calcium
carbide at Northwest Gay with the help of
the hydro-electric power to be supplied by
the State Government, it reckons to pres-
have a much stronger string to its bow.
J 11. Gillies, who projected the scheme
primarily for the purpose of supplying cur-
rent for metal-refining works, has not given
up that idea, and claims to have almost
nerfected a process for treating the complex
zinciferous ores of the West Coast. He is
still experimenting near Melbourne. His
idea when he started the Tasmanian scheme
was to get his material from Broken liill.
where he was engaged at the time on works
put up on Block 10. He might have suc-
ceeded better if lie had been a much better
administrator.

“Thermos”: A word about benzol and
toluene (B. 23/9/M5). The principal
source of benzol is era tar, which yields up
to 4 p.c. by volume; bin considerable quan-
tities of benzol are of a led Tern coal gases,
as much as four ;a lons per ton of coal
treated being obtained, co..taining TO to 80
p.c. benzine and 12 to i/> p.c. toluene,
the latter the base of high, explosives, like
tri-nitro-toluene and picric acid. As benzine
and toluene are the chief i! i.minants in gas
they cannot very well be removed from the
household supply, but where the illuminants
do not matter, as in coke-oven gas, they can
be reclaimed as a source of profit. Before
the war England produced and exported the
greatest amount of benzol of any country,
chiefly to Germany, which made aniline dyes
out of the benzine and explosives from the
toluene. When war came along John Bull
consequently had whips of benzol on hand
and didn’t need to buy much from Tim-.
Bam. The coal at Newcastle (N.S.W.) is
known to contain fair quantities of benzol ;
and the Broken Hill Prop, has a big asset in
the product contained in its coke-oven gas
and the tar. From 10 to 12 thousand gallons
a week might be derived from these works
alone if the co. installed the necessary plant.

One Australian who has been hit hard by
the war is the sapphire miner of Central
Queensland. Before the Hun broke loose
the Australian gems were mostly bought,
cut, polished and distributed by German
firms, but that’s all over now. In conse-
quence the gem-miner—what is left of him —
finds his hands full of at-present unsaleable
stones. _ The Sapphiretown Progress Asso-
ciation is trying to extend the helpful paw
to the local digger,- and appeals to patriotic
Australians who require something in the
line of personal decoration to buy sapphires
mined and cut in the Commonwealth. An
expert lapidary is attending to the artistic
side of the business. It is a good chance to
capture another bit of the enemy’s trade.

Japan has wiped the eye of the IJ.S.A.
over the Chinese oilfields. Standard Oil had
an agreement with (he Chinese Government
to develop the Shenshi and Chi Li oil dis-
tricts, and the tentative contract of a year
expired the other day. Then the Chinese
Government refused to enter into- the per-
manent agreement projected, and a very dis-
appointed vice-nresident of Standard Oil
left Pekin. The Japs will probably operate
the fields, which means that Sam loses the
great Chinese market for kerosene. The
spread of civilisation was all right—until it
spread too far.

BEFORE THE MIRROR.
By “JEANNETTE.”
“Jeannette,” the well-known writer on Beauty Culture and author of “The Book of Beauty,”
will be pleased to help and advise any reader on matters of the toilet. Queries should be accom-
panied by a stamped addressed envelope, and directed to “Jeannette,” c/o “Before the Mirror,”
43 Gray's Inn Road, London, W.C., England.
These are undoubtedly days of exceptional nervous strain for one and all of
us. Anxiety, with its beauty-destroying influence, is casting its shadow over the
lives of many of us women, and while, perhaps, a few —the more stoical among
us —can avoid worrying over past and prospective events, we may all, with a little
care and forethought, succeed in preventing the results of worry from being notice-
able in our appearance. To these fortunate few this little chat will, however, be
as interesting and instructive as to those who stand in real need of help in toilet
matters, and may be the means of bringing to their notice some hitherto unknown
method of retaining, or regaining, that beauty of face and figure which is the birth-
right of every woman. Some of the ingredients mentioned below are at present
not generally known to the public, but any good chemist will usually be found to
have a small quantity in stock.
A Beautiful Complexion by Natural Means. —
The secret of a perfect complexion lies in the
continual renewing of the outer cuticle of the
skin. This is Nature’s own method. The
outer skin as it .becomes coarse or shrivelled
must be remove*.., and an opportunity given to
the finer one beneath to show itself. It is
because the old, dead skin is allowed to remain
on the face that' so many women, and even
young girls, suffer from pimples, blotches and
sallow dull skins.' To remove, by absorption,
the dead outer skin and with it all blemishes,
the use of mercblised wax is universally re-
commended, ordinary face creams being
powerless for this purpose. Smear the wax
over the face and neck, rub it gently into the
skin, and leave it on all night. In the morning
wash it off, using Pilenta soap and warm
water, when all the dead skin will be removed
with the wax. Then apply a lotion to prevent
any trace of greasiness being noticeable and
to give a peach-like bloom to the skin. A
lotion to do this can be made up quite cheaply
from the following recipe. Take one ounce of
eleminite and dissolve it in four tablespoonfuls
of hot water. Place in a bottle, and when cool
apply to the face with the finger tips, allowing
it to dry on the skin.
To Increase the Growth of the Hair.— Few
women give enough attention to the hair,
Which, if it is to be kept in good condition,
requires systematic brushing, regular sham-
pooing, and a tonic for at least two or three
months in each year. The hair should be
brushed every night for from five to ten
minutes, and the scalp massaged. When a
tonic is to be applied it should be dabbed into
the roots immediately after the massage, while
the scalp is still warm and glowing. To make
a simple and inexpensive lotion which will in-
crease the growth of the hair take a quarter
of a pint of bay rum, and add to it one ounce
of boraniuin. Shake well and allow it to stand
for half an hour, then strain, and add suffi-
cient water to make half a pint.
Superfluous Hair, and How to Remove It.—
Superfluous hair is a real trial to those who
daily see the growth which disfigures their
whole face steadily increasing, for nothing so
completely destroys a woman’s claim to good
looks. To remove it quickly and permanently
take a little pheminol and mix with a little
cold water. Dust the skin, from which the
liair is to be removed, with some powdered
alum, then apply the plieminol paste with a
bone knife. Leave it on for two minutes, then
wash it off. If the growth be very strong two
or more applications may be necessary to re-
move it, but this treatment will eventually so
weaken and destroy the roots that the trouble
will be banished for all time.
To Remove Blackheads.—Dissolve one effer-
vescing stymol tablet in a glass of hot water,
allow the effervescence to subside, then dip a
small sponge into the liquid and mop over
the face. Allow it to remain on for a few
minutes, then wipe off With a towel, and the
blackheads will be entirely removed. To pre-
vent them from reappearing use a stymol tab-
let in the manner described twice a week.
How to Shampoo.—‘Before shampooing the
hair dip the fingers into a little pure olive or
almond oil, and thoroughly massage the scalp.
Then dissolve a teaspoonful of stallax granules
in a cup of hot water. Fill a basin with warm
water into which the ends of the hair can fall,
and shampoo the stallax mixture into the
roots in the usual way. Then rinse and dry
by fanning with a palm fan.
To Wave the Hair. —To wave the hair do not
use waving irons, as these are most injurious
to the hair, causing it to fade and turn grey,
and to become harsh and brittle. Get two
ounces of silmerine at any chemist’s and damp
the hair with it, then either plait tightly,
tying the ends, or arrange it in waving pins.
The Trials of the Stout Woman. —The stout
woman is not only at a disadvantage in ap-
pearance, but she is always uncomfortable
physically and seldom in really good health
while she remains too fat. To remove obesity,
without injuring the general health or alter-
ing the usual diet, a few clynol berries should
be eaten occasionally, and a glass of hot water
sipped after each meal. This combined treat-
ment will work wonders in a very short time,
and is a most pleasant as well as effective
remedy.
Grey Hair. —-To restore the color of grey or
fading hair take one ounce of concentrated
tammalite and mix it with four ounces of bay
rum, apply to the hair for several nights,
using a small sponge, and the hair will gradu-
ally resume its original color. When the
desired shade has been obtained, the tamma-
lite lotion should be used about twice a week.
Apply it to the roots with an old toothbrush. [4

journalistic grind, was used in The B. in the early
’9o’s—perhaps before that. .. . F.M.P.: But it won’t
be quite so easily done as that. The agent for the
ingenious Asiatic may offer in Sydney to supply
traders with goods carrying well-known enemy brands

word to say about it. If they pretend to be enemy
goods they will be treated as enemy g00d5....

From Callan Park :■ —
If a soldier becomes detached from his passbook
and fails to recover the document before the stretcher-
bearers carry him to the beach, Red Tape finds
itself knocked endways. Before he can get any
cash Bill has to wait for somebody to repulse the
enemy and retrieve his statement of account. As it
seems absolutely necessary that Bill should carry a
record with him, I draw the attention of the
authorities to the fact that tattooing can be per-
formed expeditiously and almost painlessly by an
-expert. Across the shoulders could be picked-in the
wearer’s name, etc. Thus: “Bill Wallaby in account
with the Empire.” On the left of the spinal division
there .could be set out the cash advanced. On the
right the credit might appear thus: “By services.”
This would bje brought up to date at convenient
pauses. Then when Bill was deposited in a hospital
and wanted a couple of quid, he would simply pre-
sent his back to the head nurse or the pay-window,
and a small calculation would show what was due to
him. Or if it was the end of the section for him the
account could be balanced, ruled off in red Indian-
ink and with a small mechanical stamping appli-
ance Bill could get a receipt on the lumbar region,
and thus have his discharge and his cash and a per-
manent record of honorable service all in one. This
is a simple and efficient plan of eliminating waste
and curses, and has the additional merit of affording
to holders of the V.C. and amputated arms protec-
tion against impersonation. The moment someone ]
calls for volunteers to put the scheme into execu-
tion I shall at once cease to shirk and offer my
services as director of military accountancy.
THE GOL DARN YANK.
They may talk o’ Eagles screamin’
And the glory o’ the Yank,
But of scrap he’s never dreamin’,
So its only gol darn swank.
He guesses some each morning,
And he calculates at night;
He’s something big at fawning
When the dollars are in sight.
He's a crossbred Dago Yankee,
A Noo Yark Port-a-gee,
Right smart and awful swanky
Since the old men spilled tlie tea.
But he ain’t done no shootin’
Since the Junkers drowned his kids,
And folks think ’e wants bootin’
Cos lie held his hand for quids.

WHY NOT GET RID AND STAY RID
FOR ALL TIME OF YOUR TIRING,
DEBILITATING AND NOT BEAUTIFUL
EXCESS FAT?
EXCESS fat injures your health, impedes
your movements, and makes you the
butt of your unfeeling normal-weight
friends. People who are excessively
fat never feel well and vigorous like nor-
mal folk. People who have been fat and
are now reduced to normal think other fat
people ridiculous. Excess fat also impedes
the heart action, rendering its functions
difficult, and interferes with the breathing.
Not alone does excess fat injure your
health and endanger your existence; it
absolutely destroys your figure and makes
you a ludicrous sight. Why do you stay
fat?
“TI-SARKIN”
positively removes excess fat and will restore your spoiled figure to
decent and pleasing proportions; it is always a sure and lasting
cure for obesity and corpulency. A few doses improves your
breathing wonderfully, and the course of treatment will cure you.
It is the only successful and, at the same time, harmless fat-reducer
that has ever been discovered. Its efficacy has been undeniably
demonstrated in thousands of successfully-treated cases. It is
totally and absolutely noil-poisonous, and can in no wise work any
injury to the general health, even though it often reduces excess
of weight by as much as a pound a day. On the contrary,
improved conditions in the general health become noticeable in less
than a week after its use is begun.
LET US PROVE ITS EFFICACY TO YOU.
Watworth Co. N.S.W.
Dear Sirs, —I am quite satisfied with your wonderful, treatment. It has
made a new woman of me. I have lost weight wonderfully, and my breathing
is all right now. Since taking the Ti-Sarkin I can do my work without a
bit of trouble. I will never lose an opportunity to praise and tell everybody
that needs Ti-Sarkin about your marvellous treatment.—Yours faithfully,
(Sgd.) Mrs. JOHNSON.

“TI-SARKIN
DOES NOT FAIL!
LET US PROVE IT.
Manager Watworth Co. Cuprona, Tas.
Dear Sir, —In replying to your kind inquiry
as to the permanency of my reduction from
the use of “Ti-Sarkin,” I am pleased to tell you
that the results are more satisfactory than I
ever anticipated they could possibly be. “Ti-
Sarkin” has produced a wonderful improve-
ment in my health and condition. When I
began its use I weighed 13 stone 31b., and I
began to lose weight after the first few doses,
and continued rapidly until I was quite satis-
fied that I was thin enough, having lost a
stone a month. Before taking “Ti-Sarkin” my
work was always a burden, but since my re-
duction it is just the reverse, and now I am
able to take great pleasure and interest in all
about me. My friends all marvel at my rapid
loss of weight and vast improvement in my
general health. They say they can scarcely
believe their eyes, and they as well as myself
feel very well pleased, and your methods
gained many warm advocates from the success
in my case.
I hope that many faltering women whose
excess weight is a burden to them will be
convinced by my experience, and my earnest
advice to all my fat friends is to have a course
of “Ti-Sarkin.” Now I eat heartily and enjoy
my food, and find no cause whatever for com-
plaint.
You are at liberty to make whatever use you
may choose of this letter.—Yours sincerely,
(5803) (Signed) Mrs. A. CARR.
BEAD THIS LETTER.
Manager Watworth Co. Sandgate, Q’ld.
Dear Sir, —When I wrote you in July last
my niece was rapidly improving under your
treatment. She was then over 15 stone in
weight, but has since been reduced to truly
genteel proportions, and is now a very pleas-
ing figure. She continued her usual diet while
under treatment, and was in no way incon-
venienced, and I am truly grateful to you for
the result, for, before the treatment, she was
absolutely devoid of any semblance of a figure,
a burden to herself and friends, and unhappy
generally. She has reduced considerably over,
three stone, and her health has improved to a
splendid extent. —Yours respectfully,
M. CRAMS.

Firestone
Non-SKid T y res.
For the hard road-for the hot pace—for the long
grind—for true economy and service .
The success of Firestone Tyres has proved that the motorist
can have comfort, safety and the “ most miles per shilling.”
Firestone Tyres are preferred because of highest quality at the least
cost—as the greatest value, even though there are ‘‘cheaper' tyres.
The rubber in them is supremely good. It lias the- quality of greatest heat-
resistance, of greatest wear endurance. Every Firestone Tyre contains an extra quantity
of this extremely good rubber.
The Non-skid lettering is an imprint of safety. On every highway of the world it
challenges the need of other anti-skid safeguards. It holds the standard for endurance
and economy. The letters prevent spin or skid in any direction, they radiate the heat
of road friction, insure perfect traction with gasoline economy, car-protection and
comfort beyond contradiction.
iB
Firestone Tyres are made by specialists in the largest
exclusive tyre factory in the world. This year's Firestone
output Ims increased 78 per cent. Firestone are tyres of
greatest siren gth, sturdiness and safety— ...
for the Price of Only Ordinary Tyres.
Leading dealers everywhere endorse Firestone quality, and
motorists praise Firestone service.

Allies’ Day in N. S. Wales is to get a
lift from an art uuion, prizes donated by
Anthony Hordern and Sons. First prize is
a suite of furniture worth £lOO or other
goods to that value. It costs only a shilling*
The story is told of a Yankee bagman who came
to hustle the Australian into purchasing an article
that was already manufactured here in sufficient
quantities to meet all local demands. The depressed
bagman cursed this continent, and determined to get
even with it before he left. He discovered that very
few in this barbaric country indulged in chewing
gum, so he cabled for a shipment, and pushed it on
the unsuspecting Australian. When he had sold every
•Vet, he reckoned he had had his revenge, and
returned to his country to nominate for the Presi-
u< ncv, or something. The demand - having been
created, chewing gum now arrives by the ton,- and
the Customs revenue has benefited to such an extent
that the Wriglev people reckon it time to get oh the
right side of the tariff fence. So the eo.’s assistant
factory superintendent,- W. H. Johnstone, has arrived
to start a factory, nartly. with Australian capital, to
supply Australia with Australian chewing gum, and,
incidentally, look for a foreign market up north and
in S. Africa.*
WHAT DYSPEPTICS SHOULD EAT.
A PHYSICIAN’S ADVICE.
“Indigestion and practically all forms of
stomach trouble are, nine times out of ten,
due to acidity; therefore stomach sufferers
ghould, whenever possible, avoid eating food
that is acid in its nature, or which by chemi-
cal action in the stomach develops acidity.
Unfortunately, such ii rule eliminates most
foods which are pleasant to the taste as weli
as those which are rich in blood, flesh and
nerve building properties. This is the reason
why dyspeptics and stomach sufferers are
usually so thin, emaciated and lacking in
that vital energy which can only come from
a well-fed body. For the benefit of those
sufferers who have been obliged to exclude
from their diet all starchy, sweet or fatty
food, and are trying to keep u» a miserable
existence on gluten products, I would sug-
gest that you should try a meal of any food
or foods which you may like -in moderate
amount, taking immediately afterwards half
a teaspoonful of bisurated' magnesia in a
little hot or cold water. This will neutralise
any acid which may be present, or which
may be formed, and instead of the usual feel-
ing of uneasiness and fulness you will find
that your food agrees with you perfectly.
Bisurated magnesia is doubtless the best food
corrective and antacid known. It is not a
medicine, and has no direct action on the
stomach ; but by neutralising the acidity of
the food contents, and thus removing the
source of the acid irritation which inflames
the delicate stomach lining, it does more
than could possibly be done by any drug or
medicine. As a physician I believe in the
use of medicine whenever necessary, but I
must admit that I cannot see the sense of
dosing an inflamed and arritated stomach
with drugs instead of getting rid of the acid
-—the cause of all the trouble. Get a little
bisurated magnesia > frpm your chemist, eat
■what you want at your next meal, take some
of the bisurated magnesia as directed above,
.and see if I’m not right.”/ 1 '
IN
BANANA LAND
“Pressman”: Fisher is to be Australia’s
High Commissioner, although it is only lately
that he bowed to party pressure. As the
move involves the resignation of the Min-
istry, th 6 party will have the opportunity of
jettisoning some of the misfits. P.M.G.
Spence for one is marked, and a couple of
others are shaky. Hughes is credited with
the statement that he wouldn’t attempt to
run the show with the present team, and
what Hughes says ends a lot of argument in
the camp.
Queensland Education Department has
cancelled the privilege hitherto enjoyed by
German districts of sending children one
school-day per week to German schools for
the avowed purpose of receiving religious in-
struction. The - German pastors have been
informed that they have the same right of
giving religious tuition in State schools as
other clergymen, and that the absence of
any enrolled State-school pupil on a regular
school day will henceforth be treated as a
breach of the regular attendance clause of
the Act. Lutheran religious instruction in
Queensland is always given in German, and
a good deal of loyalty to Fatherland and
Kaiser Bill has been hitherto pumped in
as well. Henceforth the young Bananalander
of German blood is to be taught that the
duty of the dweller in Australia is to be an
Australian.
The financial statement this year shows
that the Ministry proposes carrying on along
lines which involve an increased expendi-
ture of £4§3,290, caused by the necessity of
finding an additional £280,000 for Cohen
apd a considerably increased sum in wages
for railway employees. It also proposes to
borrow wherever it sees a chance of get-
ting a million, so the task of finding a
further bit more for the Cohen family will
probably have to be faced again when Ryan
is 12 months older. As things stand now
one out of every three pounds of public
revenue raised by the State goes to the man
with the mortgage. This looks a fairly
painful sort of blister; but as Ministers are
persuaded that “a drastic slackening” of
pawn would have a “disastrous effect,” they
are nqt going to be deterred from making
the blister larger if more p.n. can be nego-
tiated. Which shows how far-seeing politi-
cians can be, the obvious remedy for' ful-
ness after meals being to eat more meals
and get fuller.
Ex-mayor Thorne, of Brisbane, died very
suddenly in Adelaide the other day. He
was a grandson of the English founder of the
Bible Christian sect, and was invited to
South Aus. for the centenary celebration.
Chief Justice Way is also a descendant
of one of the pioneers. Thorne’s brother-in-
law, Octavius Lake, president of the Metho-
dist Conference in S.A., had introduced him
to a meeting, and he was telling his reminis-
cences, when he collapsed, and died in a few
minutes.
It turns out that Hulton Sams, the Fight-
ing Parson, was killed at Hooge while crawl-
ing from a trench to get water for some of
his wounded men. No one who knew him
will be surprised to hear it.
In the Arbitration Bill originally put.
befoi’e the Queensland Assembly the domes-
tic servant Avas excluded and the public ser-
vant included. Noav the public servant is
out and the domestic lady is in. There isn’t
much consistency in inflicting a remedy on
the private employer that the Government
refuses to take itself.
The versatility of Tommy Kangaroo
deserves a word of recognition. A man
back in Brisbane from Cairo says that the
intelligent Arab donkey-boys who ferried
the • espeditionaries around during their
training in Egypt have achieved a vocabu-
lary of Australian that makes them the
pride of all their tribe. That’s one side
of the picture. Mrs. Langer Owen, just
back in Sydney from Colombo, supplies the
other:—•
At one of the ports we took on 500 reinforcements,
and boys were exceedingly well-behaved on the
boat. For instance, when they discovered that the
ladies were fond of singing they learned hymns and
sang them to us. It was so beautiful.
Versatile, rather!
The iron road which links up Cleveland
with South Brisbane is still Bananalahd’s
biggest white elephant in railways. During
the year ending June 30 it lost £6401, or, in
other words, it took £325 to earn £lOO.
Compared with the previous year it earned
13 per cent, more; but the Department had
to spend 31 per cent, more money to
make the line do it. The people who
go down to the muddy beaches at Manly
ACCENTS WILL HAPPEN.
“ ’Ere y’are! Tosti’s A jew for thruppence.”
"Veil! Can’t a man be a Jew midout making a song about it?”
and thereabouts, mostly the well-to-do,
never shriek at the anomaly ; but if it were
a line up in the Gulf, or serving some mii)r
ing hamlet, the Tories would make it a bone
of trouble and say in a loud, uncouth voice
that it was another proof of the scandalous
wastefulness of Sosh.
Archie Meston has been called upon by
the Government to look around. His posi-
tion as representative of the State in Sydney
is to be tilled by a much cheaper officer, so
one of Bananaland’s most picturesque adver-
tisements is cancelled. Cheapness is often
a 'splendid scheme for wasting money.
Toowoomba Gazette braved the Censor
the other day and gave the Kaiser the
straight tip about what was coming to him:
The group of workers at Evergreen now numbers
23, and their energy and enthusiasm in knitting
socks is very hopeful as a sign of the Empire’s
awakening.
When the Gazette is thrown over the
■front gate at Potsdam and the Emperor
charges down upon it to know the worst,
the misguided man’s hour of humiliation
wi'B> have arrived. ‘'They are avake—avake
at Effergrin}” he will mutter, and reeling
bacft into the palace he will shake his soiled
fist at the universe and cry “Hoch ! Tie up
der dogs of var.” This conveying of infor-
mation to the enemy was bound to precipi-
tate a crisis.

QUEENSLAND.
M. FORREST.
QUEENSLAND GOSSIP.
Brisbane, October 10, 1910.
My Dear Tiiargomindah,—.
Governor Goold-Adams aufl his lady sam-
pled the Barnum Powell method of doing it
to-day* at Merthyr, New Farm, one-time
the home of Samuel Griffith. The Boy
Scouts did their tricks well, and a large
assembly of admiring parents sat in the
blazing sun for a couple of hours without
a sign of fatigue.
Amongst other schemes that were to-day
put on the track of the patriotic coin was a
floral fair, in Dutton Park. Mayoress Davey
officially started it with a good'wish for the
Young Wimmin’s Liberal Club which had
done the organising work. Half the pro-
ceeds £oes to the -South Brisbane Red Cross.
Mrs. Le Fanu was another opener of
fetes this afternoon. The one she assisted
to propel was in the grounds of Holy Trin-
ity Church at Woolloongabba, and the cash
raised will go to the Soldiers’ Help Society
and other similar laudable objects. At Kel-
vin Grove Mrs. McCook pioneered a garden
entertainment for the benefit of a motor
ambulance fund which is the special anxiety
of the White Ribbon Society.
Myrtle Overell and Esme Sparkes gave a
chocolate-and-handkercliief afternoon on
Thursday, and the pile of gifts they arrested
will be forwarded to the Christmas cheer
fund which the Brisbane Girls’ Club is
accumulating.
Yet another “day” is threatened. Copper
Day this one, the modest organisers having
decided to let the public down lightly. Pro-
ceeds go to buy Christmas tuck for the boys
in the trenches.
Yesterday was Ambulance Friday, and
about £450 was gathered to help along the
good work of the brigade. The amount is
larger than was snared last year, but it
was not enough when one remembers the
help the Q.A.T.B. has given in connection
with Red Cross activity ever since the war
started.
E. H. Macartney’s two sons left on
Thursday to join the Khyber at Sydney <gn
route for England and the army.
A. C. Macartney is a mining engineer, and
has been following his profession in South
Africa and Peru. Brother Ellison is a
lawyer. They are fine specimens of Queens-
landers. The Golf Club, of which Ellison
was a member, farewelled him on Tuesday
night.
Another Brisbane boy who has just gone
into camp is Fred Lewis, son of J. R. H.
Lewis, of Brisbane Telegraph. " He has
been in the Bank of N. S. Wales for some
years. On Thursday night the Brisbane
Players’ Amateur Dramatic Club, of which
he has been a member ever since, it was a
club, played Mark Ambient’s comedy, “A
Snug Little Kingdom,” in aid of the Jim-
biliyc-an fund, when Lewis took the part of
Bernard Gray.
Mr. Und Mrs. F. Rutledge, of Yambar-
gun station, came to town this week to say
good-bye to their three young sons, who are
oif for some part of the Front in a very
short time. The Auchterlonies, of Gympie,
also have three sons in the firing line, their
ages being 18, 20 and 22.
Marion Walker, daughter of Edgar
Walker, is about to sail for Egypt to nurse
wounded Australians. On Tuesday the
members of the Red Cross Society of Hamil-
ton lined up while Mrs. Russell, Mayoress,
presented to maid Marion a writing case
and a gold-decorated pen.
Some excitement was caused on North
Quay during the week, when a soldier in
uniform got into the river to rescue his dog.
which he thought was drowning. The dog
was all right, and while its master struggled
for his own life it came quietly out and
searched for fleas. Two policemen in a row-
ing boat finally rescued the sentimental bloke.
He ought to be a good pal at the Front.
Mrs. Donald Cameron recently gave a
somewhat unusual sort of luncheon party.
Her guests were 20 girls, and after thev had
soothed an appetite they set to work to
make sand-bags. The shadow of the war
is with us, even in our most sacred rites.
Eric Conran, who has made a name for
himself in aviation in England, has almost
recovered from the wound that put him off
the active-service list for a time. His
mother was a Miss Molle, a Brisbane girl,
and daughter of Mrs. George Raff. Young
Captain Conran is an instructor at the Cen-
tral Flying School, at Upavon, Wiltshire.
One of the latest engagements binds Miss
Roberta Burton, daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
IL E. Burton, to Noel Ridgway, only son of
Mr. and Mrs. R. G. Ridgway. The marriage
will take place in a few days, and shortly
afterwards the bridegroom will buckle on his
ironmongery and go off to join a few friends
in Gallipoli.
The canefields have an inquiring visitor
J- H-. S. Olifent, secretary of the South
Aus. Lmted Labor party. Having a month
off he is taking a ’busman’s holidav by look-
ing into the entirely different labor and har-
vesting conditions of Bananaland.
Yours affectionately,
AUSTRALIA JANE.
“W.C.M.”: Tennis players should look at
their racquets. I opened up a case last
week, bought through a Sydney merchant.
The tools seemed to be as good as
those supplied direct by the crack
makers of England. And the prices!
The Sydney firm invoiced them at
565.' a dozen, less 10 per cent., after
paying landing charges and a duty of 35 per
cent., and after providing for the dis-
tributors’ profit, and sending the goods
carriage-paid to Brisbane! The local
merchants will sell them for just a
little less than English-made racquets, and
at the same time, while pocketing their mag-
nificent profit, will blither about giving pre-
ference to British-made goods. There is
only one way to make the average merchant
do anything. That is, by making it unprofit-
able for him to do anything else. This coun-
try won’t get preference either for itself or
for Britain by any other plan.
It began-before a Land Board, but not
being satisfied there one of the parties dived
into print and a libel suit. This lasted 21
days, and was garnished by highly-sugared
barristers four deep. The property about
which the wrangle revolved was hundreds
of miles away on the border, and it occurred
to the Court that the jury should make a
personal inspection. Made accordingly. The
verdict, as usual, did not please both parties,
so the aggrieved appealed to the Full Court.
That learned body upset the judgment, hold-
ing that the talkative Beal had misdirected
the jury. So a new trial has been granted
—to decide the existence, as a fact, of 500
clumps of prickly pear on a selection. Pro-
bably the whole selection, including the
pear, has long since melted into coin and
dropped into the pockets of the Bar, with
the parties still as far oft' a decision as ever.
Still, thing's like that, you know, must be in
every famous victory.

inch, and
B.S.A. Fittings are

B.S.A. Trade Marks on EVERY PART.
They are your guarantee.
Trace the life of a genuine B.S.A.
Fittings Bicycle from the time of
purchase, and you will find it one
long record of satisfaction to the
rider. Day in and day out it gives
unfailing service, and provides many
hours of real enjoyment because of
its easy running and comfort. Con-
trast this with the cheap “ pattern ”
machine, in which, as a result of
substituting cheapness for quality,
something is always going wrong.
You will make satisfaction certain
by having your bicycle built of
GENUINE
FITTINGS
You will find it truest economy, for
not only will you enjoy greater
comfort and security with three or
four times the length of service that
a cheap “pattern” machine will give
you, but your bicycle will always
have a good selling
value, as against the
“scrap” price that the
second-hand “pattern”
machine usually
fetches.

A TONIC for the NERVES.
Nervous people who have not yet de-
veloped a disease that can be recognised and
treated by the medical profession have the
greatest trouble in finding relief. -Irrita-
bility, headache, sleeplessness, nervous dys-
pepsia, all these discomforts make life miser-
able but are endured rather than run a
doctor’s hill without definite hope of re-
covery.
Every such sufferer should know the dan-
ger of such a condition of the nervous sys-
tem. Nervous debility and even paralysis
may easily result if the tone of the nerves
is not restored.
The one big fact that brings hope and
relief is that the nerves can he'restored by
building up the blood. It cannot be too
often repeated that only through the blood
can nourishment and medicine reach the
nerves. I)r. Williams’ Pink Pills make the
blood rich and red and quickly restore
vitality and energy to a weak nervous sys-
tem. A nervous person who gives these
pills a trial is almost certain to see good
results, and, what is more, the benefit will
be lasting because the trouble is attacked at
its root. Thin blood makes weak nerves.
Building up the blood restores nerve force.
Get a box of Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills
to-day. They can be had at any dealer’s.
A useful booklet. “Diseases of the Ner-
vous System,” will be sent to anyone send-
ing name and address to Dept. “L,” P.O.
Box 594, Sydney.*
DO YOU FEEL SLUGGISH?
It is probable that most chronic constipa-
tion is due to failure to teach and insist
upon regularity of habits during childhood.
Constipation quickly contaminates the
blood, deranges the nervous system ’ and
upsets the entire health. The victim becomes
drowsy, irritable, restless, has bad dreams
and is mentally and physically sluggish.
In the new laxative. Pinkettes, is pre-
sented a dainty, sugar-coated oval that is
free from unpleasant effects, does" not upset
the stomach nor gripe, but simply gives
nature the needed assistance.

free sample, or get a full size Is. bottle of
Pinkettes from your own chemist.*

“R.C.D.” : A par. in Sporting Notions (B
30/9/’l5) states that one Alec Porter was the flist
Australian to fly with an Australian machine con-
taining an Australian-made engine. He wasn’t, not
bv a couple of years or more. - 1 ” 1 -i 1 1 «ii o t^
brother, J. R. Duigan (since a certificated p lot),
built throughout a biplane on the lines ot the Hem
Farman machine, with elevator in front, am P
riel led by a large-diameter steep-pitch geaied-down
propeller. Flights of several hundred yards weie
obtained in 1910, and at the••beginning of 19H the
machine was capable of continuous flight.
brother flew the machine publicly, on the Bendigo
Racecourse, about Faster time in that year; repoi ts
of the flights and photographs of the machine in
the air appeared in the Bendigo papers. Ihe engine
was of 25 li.p., 4-cvl. vertical, with water-cwled
heads to the cylinders, and was made by J. L. iin, ,
of Melbourne. The machine was built throughout
on the station here (Spring Plains, Mia Alia, ' '(•),
and is still here in good order. The contraption
was particularly easy to control. I. flew it myself on
nianv occasions, so i can probably claim to he seconi.
on the list. I have photos of this machine in the
air, both here and at Bendigo, also of later aeio-
planes that we built, with higher-powered engines.
One of Hie very first letters that came to
Tun Bulletin from Gallipoli was beautifully Aus-
tralian. “To settle a hot,” it said, “please say”—
something or other about the Stiuihury-'J owns match.
The sequel arrived by the last mail. “You will be
sorrv to hoar that the two men who had the argu-
ment about Stanbur.v and Towns have gone out and
their stake-holder —your humble servant—is wounded
and unfit for service.”
Up to the middle of last month 2(1!) young
men affiliated with the N. S. Wales Amateur Swim-
mini*’ Association had grabbed a rifle from the rack
and taken the war-trail. Amongst them' are such
great swimmers' as Cecil Healy, Billy Longwoitli,
Tommy Adrian, S. Riddington and K. C. Fox, to
say nothing of those who have lost their lives and
have been specifically honored- —Swannell, Rosenthal,

Tims .T. B. Ilarcourt. president of the
Wellington (MX.) Racing Club, on the question
whether the game of kings, bottle-obs, out of work
dukes on short leave from the Front, hookies and
sundries should he curtailed pending the bedding
down of the Kaiser and the cutting-up of Germany
into compensation allotments: ’’There are always
people whose appetite for gloom and depression is
so insatiable that they decry any pleasure being
taken hi 1 the public, even when it lias the heart to
do so. No one sympathises more than we do with
the relations of those who have fallen, and whose
sacrifice will ever be shrouded in glory, hut we must
not. even if we would, cover ourselves with sackcloth
and ashes, and remain for ever miserable. The
war may probable last a long time, and many further
sacrifices may yet have to he made, hut at the pre-
sent we can - see no good reason to suggest that we
should do other than carry on as usual.” Harcourt
reckons that the only purpose that would lie served
by shutting up the courses would be to -throw out
of employment a great number of people who are
all more or less beyond the age, or lacking the
equipment, for military usefulness. Referring to the
financial benefits to the State from the tote, he
stated that the revenue derived from the machine in
M B (on the old percentage) was sufficient to pay
31- per cent, on the cost: of: the “gift” battleship now
in the North Sen and provide a sinking fund to
liquidate the original cost .in 24 years. Which
makes Isaac McJericho in Australia smile. He could
do that on his hat if he felt that way !

“Leo Lear” : The black fish mentioned by
“Nyin” (B. 19/8/To) as a good fighter is worthy
of some limelight; This fish is widely distributed
from Queensland to Tasmania, and goes under so
many names that it is time lie was glued, riveted
or otherwise nailed down to one definite title. . For
instance, “blaekfish” in Vic., Tas. and parts 1 of
N.S.W. ; about Orange and the Snowy, “slippery” ;
also. “toiler” in parts of N.S.W. Sometimes lie is
“gudgeon” and “cod” and, in Queensland, “Xikkie”
and “Xikkie Long.” Science, lo lessen or add con-
fusion, dubs the sport Gadopsie marmwatuis. The
blaekfish is a very old representative, and lias no
near relatives on earth, the perch being 1 his next-o'-
kin. There are strange points about his distribu-
tion. Lor instance, in Tasmania all the Bass-strait
rivet's carry—'blaekfish except the Esk, yet none are
found elsewhere in Apple Island. The fish won’t
live in salt .or even brackish water, so he must
have been in Vie. and Tas. rivers before the treign
of Donald the prophet, when the land hurst asunder
and the waters poured into the burst thereof. Simi-
larly on the mainland Gadopsis must have‘crossed
the" Dividing Range before the days of a divide as
we know it. , In'former years blaekfish were caught
up to 61b. weight and even more, Southern Victoria
being the home of the largest; hut rtow-a-tiines a
three-pounder is rare, and most of the family arc
much smaller. They are very slow growers, and
generally get on the- business end of a line before
attaining any encouraging dimensions. The best
spots for the fish, are cool, deep, shady pools under
tea-tree and sunken logs. Here rest the old men
of the waters, ruminating on the days when worms
were soft and hooks unknown. The newehum may
sit all day and-never get a rise, for the fish seldom
bite before 4 p.rn. nor after dark. At Sassafras
(Vic.) a resident has a dozen or so pet-blaekfish in a
deep pool in his ‘garden. On being called they
come and take food 'from the hand and can he lifted
from the water and put hack again. Anvo’ne look-
ing for a fine, old-time Australian blaekfish can see
one in this collection, approaching the weight of

The Westralian Assembly took up the axe
when the Estimates were presented the other
Joint House Committee vote of
i4bo2 was spared because of an alleged sav-
ing of <1 few hundreds in lighting last year;
! m n U, l l exeS '-” were reduced to £279.
and £4oo was lopped off the Printing Com-
nuttee s proposed outlay. The Museum and
i V iAA<t' al e Fpo^ e suffered t 0 the extent of
±lOOO, and £2oo was cut off the Zoo. The
way Government motor-cars were used for
.10} rides by departmental officials came in
lor a blistering, and £455 was taken off this
vote as a sort of protest. The Public
Library item was reduced by £250, and a
lew others, including the London Agency,
'i ere similarly treated. The House seemed
bent on continuing its good work, when the
appearance of a disconsolate figure in the
gallery, said to be the late caterer in search
ot bad debts, created uneasiness and a hur-
ried adjournment followed.
The price of bread and flour is coming
down again, and a curious admission was
made by N.S.W. Attorney-General Hall in
announcing the fact:—
The heavy fall in the price of bran and pollard has
increased the loss on the: wheat imported by the
Government, and has necessitated the prices of flour
and bread being kept up a week or two longer than
was anticipated.
In other words, having made a fool of itself
by going into a business that it knows
nothing about, and having naturally made a
loss, this Labor Government is artificially
inflating prices in order to relieve itself of
some bad debts. But these inflated prices
don tgo to the local producer. As usual, it
is the foreigner who benefits. Much the
same thing happened in S. Aus. There also
the Government imported stuff; the market
tell; and the Government then set out to
keep the public from getting ..goods at a
reasonable price until its own Stock was
cleared. Now, suppose Private Enterprise

PURSUANT to an Order of the Court of
Chancery of the County Palatine of
Lancaster made in the MATTER of the
Estate of James Cairns deceased, PEAKE v.
ROTH WELL 1915 Letter P. No. 147,
WHEREBY an inquiry was directed to be
made by the Registrar as to who were tlje
next-of-kin of the said James Cairns late of
18 Woodlands Road, Aigburth, Liverpool
in the County of Lancaster (who died on
the Bth day of January 1915) living at the
time of his death, the nersons claiming to be-
such next of kin or to be the legal personal
representatives of such of the said next of
kin as have since died or any of them are by
their Solicitors on or before the 30th day ef
December 1915 to come in and prove their
claims before the Registrar of the Man-
chester District at his Chambers situate at
4 Clarence Street, Manchester, England, or
in default thereof they will be peremptorily
excluded from the benefit of the said Order.
Tuesday the 11th day of January 1916 at
11 in the forenoon is the time and place
appointed for the adjudication on the said
claims. •
NOTE.—-James Cairns was the son of
James Cairns the elder of Glasgow, Scot-
land, and his wife Eliza. James Cairns the
younger left no parent, brother, sister, uncle
or aunt, nephew or niece him surviving
and the nearest known next of kin are some
of the children of his mother’s sisters and
brothers. John Peake of Rathgar, Dublin,
who married Eliza Aston, was an uncle of
the said James Cairns, the younger, and it
is believed that he had ten children, namely :
Willie, Alfred, Annie, Edward, John. Fred,
Harry, Claude. Walter and another who died
in infancy. It is believed that John and
Fred Peake went to America 40 years ago,
that Claude Peake joined the Army, that
Walter Peake went to sea, and that Edward
Peake went to Australia over 30 years ago.

What a boon to the traveller, the man on the land—

SHOES are exquisitely cool and light in the
hottest weather, yet none of your dowdy,
canvas shoes either but smart, elegant, in
the fore-front of fashion. Most Australian
women will have sighed for such shoes, and here
they are in the latest shipment of Bostocks. The
model illustrated is delightful even in picture
form. But think of it in reality, a light, grace-
ful shoe of finest moire, built in that new, short-
fronted shape so thoroughly French, and made
with a dainty Louis heel. If ever there was
an ideal shoe for smart wear in hot weather, it
is certainly this one. Then for other tastes,
there are other shoes equally charming in this
Bostock selection. The shoes are unmistakable,
and have the name Bostock stamped on the soles.

The Inky Way.
G. T. Taylor, who made up his last
accounts at Hobart the other day, had been
a good friend in his time to many a poor
pressman. He was chief accountant at the
Mercury office for 32 years, and saw to it
that the ghost walked all right every. Mon-
day. He died in harness; he was in his
office on Saturday morning and was taken
off by a heart attack in the evening. In
his hours of leisure he was a shining Metho-
dist and a pillar of Gold Water, and he wore
the top-hat and the frock-coat which are the
disguise of many a hypocrite, but in his
case were merely the clothes of a white
man with a kink that didn’t spoil him.
The Maoriland Government has adopted
the dangerous course of suppressing Direct
Action and Solidarity, the two shrieks of
the I.W.W. There is no progress that way.
Every truth that was ever taught, every
reform that was ever effected, was at some
time or other advocated by a minority that
was either scoffed at or crucified, or both.
So. far as the progress of the world is con-
cerned, it would be far safer to suppress
those “great” organs which never say any-
thing that the majority, or a vast minority,
don't approve of.
“Jwosp”: Re “Billet’s” par. concerning
Maoriland pressmen who have decided to go
Turking (B. 30/9/T5). His list rakes in
only North Islanders. But the South has
done its part, too. From Chcli the Lyttel-
ton Times has sent G. It. Ritchie
(wounded), F. H. Dawn (wounded), C. G.
Yorke (killed). The Christchurch Press
has lost J. G. Mullins (wounded). The
Sun sent off Noel Ross, son of Malcolm
Ross, the official correspondent for the
Loanlies. Noel was bowled out in the first
memorable argument. All these crowded
into the first rush. Another Sun man,
Abernethy, is hiking off; and still another.
Lyons, has tried the patience of the military
authorities sorely. The fact that the Auck-
land Herald is looking for five men is not
evidence of any unusual upheaval in that
Northern office. The Herald always is
looking for men.
“Mary McCommonwealth”: The girl was
pretty, and she wore a dainty frock made
in a new fashion. I could not help trying
to memorise the details of that dress and
store them up for future use; but the stout
lady who arrived at that moment was not
content to trust to memory. The moment
•she caught sight of the fluttering white
thing she stood stock still and stared vigor-
ously. Then she moved a little to the right
and stared some more. Her next manoeuvre
was to come up close to the girl and make
an investigation of the garments at short
range. Once she almost touched a sleeve;
but the girl was now chatting gaily, entirely
unconscious of the attention being devoted
to her wearing apparel. The stout lady
moved to the left and then boldly pulled out
a book and pencil from her handbag. She
began to sketch —yes, there could be no
doubt; she was making a picture of those
dainty clothes. She sketched them from six
different angles, and w r as still working away
when my eye caught sight of a third actor
in the little drama. A man'behind a news-
paper was peering at the stout dame with
eyes of rapt wonder. Sometimes he looked
from the right of the paper, sometimes from
the left, but always his large eyes burned
upon the artist as she sketched on. Then
the boat came in, and I was suddenly aware
of another pair of male eyes from the side
bench intently watching my own movements.
Id my interest in the scene I also had been
moving to follow the silent action of the
play, and the last-discovered man, who could
not see the other actors for the intervening
barrier, had found all the puzzle he wanted
in watching my interested antics. I had to
get the boat, or I suppose I should have
found somebody watching him with equal
curiosity and intentness. Only the girl who
was the pivot of the whole scene remained
unconscious of everything but the man at
her side. As they pulled the gangway up
I realised that I had had a demonstration
of a phase of human nature which accounts
for the success of certain newspapers that
look utterly inane and foolish. They are
the watchers of those who watch ; they talk
about the people who talk about the people
who are talked about.

A Mount Gambier (S.A.) Court has had
the awkward job of deciding what interrup-
tions at a patriotic meeting are unpatriotic.
Hansard itself has hard work in “getting”
interjections, and in a crowded public meet-
ing—For instance, to a statement that.
Australians had been outnumbered 10 to 1,
a disloyal shout came (so it was alleged) :
“Good enough for them.” The interjector
maintained that he meant that our fellows
are equal to enormous odds. As for the
hackneyed “Why don’t you enlist’?” one of
the orators took the trouble to come to
court and swear that this was just the inter-
jection he welcomed, as leading up to his
triumphant retort: “-Just what I’m going to
do. Who’s game to come with me?” After
which a rather puzzled Court, remarking
vaguely that these are troubled times, fined
in one case and dismissed in the other.
From a man in one of the Northcliffe offices :
The Chief is raging-. He has bust up, so he main-
tains, the old Government; now he is trying- to
destroy the Coalition. He constantly attacks Asquith,
Kitchener and Haldane. I expect you heard all
about the shell business. His latest scream is “Away
with the Incompetents.” He writes the leading
articles in the Daily Mail himself now—on special
occasions, anyhow. There is no doubt about his
tremendous influence. lie controls the Times. He

A Natural Remedy
Time was when disease was thought to be due to the
direct influence of evil spirits, and exorcism and magic
were invoked to cast it out.
Science has taught us wisdom. The evil spirits exist
still. We call them “Disease Germs,” and they also
must be cast out. Once lodged in the stomach or
intestines, fever with its hallucinations, or biliousness with
its aches and pains, is the result.
ENO S FRUIT SALT’
is the approved remedy for driving out disease germs.
Its action is quick and thorough. It clears the intestines,
rouses the torpid liver to new life, stimulates the mucous
membrane to a healthy action, and cleanses and invigorates
the whole digestive tract.
Be prepared for emergencies by always keeping a
bottle in the house .

A Pot of Boiling Fat falls on
Lady, causing Terrible Burns

Mrs. I!. WOODIIEAD (from a photo.).
Saved by REXONA.
“About three weeks ago I had
the misfortune to have a pot of
boiling fat fall from the stove on
to my right shoulder, soaking
through my dress and burning
my back and arm something ter-
ribly. X was alone in the house
at the time with a child, who
tore the blouse off me, and I was
not able to get to tiie hospital
until about noon. The doctor
told me that if the burn had
occurred on my left side that the
shock would have killed me. I
went to the hospital every day
for a week to be treated, and they
wanted to graft skin over the
burn, but, as the treatment did
not seem to help it in the
slightest, my husband told me not
to go there any longer, but to
go and get a xiot of Kexona,
which I did. X went to Mr. I’er-
eival’s store at Maroubra, and got
a pot from him, and from the
first application of Rexona 1
obtained relief.
“I have used this constantly
for the past fortnight, and the
effect has been simply wonder-
ful. Several of the sores formed
scabs; the scabs have already
fallen off - , while two of the very
severe sores have now formed
scabs and are likewise nearly
cured. My arm was swollen out to
four times its usual size, and the pain was something terrible. I could not raise my
arm, and it was all I could do to get about at all.
“Everyone who has seen the terrible way in which I have been burned think that
it is most wonderful the way Rexona has cured it, and I certainly think the cure
simply marvellous.
“Should anyone want to refer to me in respect to the matter, or the terrible way
in which I was burned, I shall be pleased to tell them at any time, and give full
particulars of how Rexona has cured me, for I feel very thankful for the cure, and
want everyone to know of the wonderful power Rexona has to heal terrible burns ol
this nature.” (Signed) 3lrs. IS. MOODHEAD.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
HE recruiting' schooner, under short-
I ened sail all night, lifted the island of
Meredeana out of the Coral Sea at
dawn and made landfall at Murua village,
as Mark Speed, the recruiter, finished his
curried mutton —-warmed from a can, and
garnished with mango chutney and fresh
shredded cocoanut.
The Misima, fitted to carry 200 native
laborers signed on for three years at six
pounds a year, food, tobacco and loin cloth
a month, floated light with empty holds. And
Mark Speed, whose recruiting fee was six
pounds a head, hoped to get a hundred and
fifty boys for plantations to the westward,
and so end an irksome career that had in it
methods of slavery, although, compared with
the callousness of the old days of “black-
birding” for Queensland sugar plantations,
the recruiting since 1901) had been the work
of angels.
Speed, in earlier voyages, bad beaten the
New Guinea coast for recruits from the
Gulf of Papua to Cloudy Bay and Mullens
Harbor, round to the Maiwara in Milne Bay.
The D’Entrecasteaux and the Trpbriands
had known him: Egum and the Lauglinans;
the Conflicts and the Louisiades ; Bonvouloir
and the Calvados Chain. He had been driven
by the scarcity of labor to the comparatively
unworlced recruiting fields further east; and
at breakfast-time on a Sunday morning lie
made ready to go ashore at Murua village,
to secure by presents, promises and bluff as
many natives as discontent or ambition
should bring to the net—each boy being six
pounds worth of real money to the recruiter,
who wanted that money, and wanted it
quickly.
“It’s a rotten game,” he said to Ilie skip-
per of the chartered schooner as the fuzzy-
headed boat’s crew of Papuans rowed them
to the limit of the water with a quarter-mile
of rotten coral-trash, bared by the tide, be -
tween the boat and the beach. “111 pull
enough out of this trip to complete the bit
I want to settle f down on, and then it’s
south to Svdnev for yours truly.”
“What’ll y’ do, then?”
“Those whom the registrar hath joined
together let no divorce judge put asunder.
Pll buy a little business and settle down for
keeps.”
“Once a man gets the smell of these
islands into his mouth he’ll be a bad hand
at voting for little municipal councillors,
and talking to self-advertisers and social
climbers, and writing letters to the papers.”
“I know! But I’m so home-sick. I tell
you; I’m dotty to leave these damned palms
that never stop waving, and this village-
smell of cocoanut-oil, and old fish, and paw-
paw that stinks of rock-melon. My nose is
a white man’s nose, and it’s itching to smell
a motor-car: and my teeth are watering for
a pint of stout in a pewter, and a saveloy.”
“Home-sick, are you?”
“So much that I’d even he glad to see a
J.P. carrying round a plate in church with
the silver rattling into it when the parson
says ‘Lav not up your treasures on earth,
where moth and rust do’ what is it?”
“ ‘Corrupt, and thieves break through and
steal.’ ”
“Yes —but ‘lay up your treasure in this
here plate, where it won’t stay till next
moth-season.’ There’s a church down
Strawberry Hills way where they preach
seriously of Jonah and the whale. Well!
I’m so dashed home-sick I’m ready to go
there and believe every word.”
“You’ve got it bad. The only cure for
home-sickness is to go home till you get sick
of home.”
“Laugh! I’ve got a girl, and a bit of
mm.- \ and this run alone ought to give me
six handled clear —that is, with luck, , . .You
■ u'.-fiem all that trade, bov?”
“v.laster, I gettem—plenty turkey red,
t’backa, music alonga mouth, big-fellow
Jew’s-harp,” replied the Papuan boat-boy.
“All right. S’pose you good boy, 1 like
you too much. You carry all that one,
strong fellei*.” .
The keel grated ou the coral splinters; tne
boy with the trade slipped over the side,
loaded himself with the goods, auu
waited to follow the white men, as two ot
the boat boys carried them ashore through
mud, coral-spoil and three inches deep ox
sea.
They heard the snake-skin drums beating
as they landed; they saw a great stack of
food —yams, taro, sugarcane, cocoanuts and
bananas —and the prancing figures of women
Whose undulating grass ramis, exposing
more than they covered, showed that a dance
was toward. ' „
“You won’t get many boys here, Mark,
said the captain. “They’ll be too tired to
move when the dance is finished, and that
won’t be till all the grub’s eaten. But 1
can see a bit of trade for me-—copra, ivory,
nuts and green sea-snail shell.”
“Don’t you worry, skip. 111 do all right
here. Out of a dance comes jealousy, and
the boy quarrels with his lover or his
wife, and is ready to go to the Devil while
the fits lasts. A row with a girl has driven
many a white man to enlist; and it works in
the nig. the same way.”
The fuzzy-headed men beat* the drums as
the women danced invitations. It was all
abandonment as the men joined. There was
no selt'-consciousness or coyness in these
cheerful sloths, cannibals, liars, gluttons,
sensualists and occasional men of war. Dog-
faced men whose hair was bleached by coral
lime; old, grey, cheerful baboons ; fat niggers
and black skeletons ; black Davids and Jona-
thans—all youths of eighteen or so—walk-
ing with their arms around each other’s
neck or with their little fingers crooked
together and swinging; old men hand-in-hand
with their grown-up sons smiling in each
other’s faces; pot-bellied babies and ancient
hags laughing uproariously at nothing.
“Too busy this crowd for you,” said the
captain. "But I think they’ll sell me a ton
of copra for nineteen Jew’s-harps and a
mouth-organ.”
“You see,” replied Speed. “There’ll be a
row here before long; and the bigger the row
the more boys will pull up stakes. . . .There’s
the chief.”
They had left the beach and were in the
street of palm-thatched and stilted houses;
gins rocked their babies in fibre nets sus-
pended beneath a great bread-fruit tree; fig-
trees, rooted like crow-foot elms, were broken
to the eye by the straight shafts of the
areca palm soaring through the undergrowth,
which sheltered the edible lily, and the creep-
ers with black-tipped red berries —the*
Mephistopheles of berries—which laced and
bound it. Cocoanuts were on the ground in
hundreds and already sprouting; cocoanuts
sprouting were disposed by the hundreds on
lines, and threw out aerial roots. Along this
one-sided street, sheltered from the sea by
the forest wall, were four hundred or more
people—men, women, children —mixed up
with dogs that looked like pigs, while a pig
that looked like a dog strayed into the
dance and squealed when the naked foot of
a dancer caught him side-ways behind his
scantily-fleshed ribs. And where a space of
a quarter-acre occurred between the houses
there were pigs in permanent session of
squealing; two of them, fatter than the
others, already roasting over a" slow fire.
From the end of the village street came the
yells of the dancers, the harmonised and
monotonous chant which was their not un-
pleasant singing; and the thunder of the
snake-skin drums.
The chief who advanced to them was a
big, powerful, fleshy man with a mop of
frizzed out hair as big as the hat of a
fashionable woman Avho fears for her com-
plexion at the seaside. His face was strongly
marked; his nose very broad and full of
energy, his eyes deep set, the chin firm ; he
was broad-shouldered, big-breasted, big-
limbed, and glossy as varnished ebony. lie
wore a nose-bone, a dog’s-tooth necklace, a
toia or arm-shell around his right biceps:
and on his left upper-arm —the flesh bulging
around its edges—a bracelet of plaited cane,
worn as a holder of scented flowers. He
wore also a sulu of printed calico, and ank-
lets of grass.
He greeted the captain and the recruiter
almost affectionately, and immediately proved
it was cupboard love by asking if they had
come to give him something.
Speed, in answer, pattered many meaning-
less phrases expressive of great admiration
of the great chief of Murua. He took from
his pocket an old briar pipe, its stem banded
with very German silver, and its bowl loudly-
advertising to the noses of all men the great
weight of tobacco which had in it become
smoke so long ago.
The chief accepted the vociferous pipe as
if it were made of gold ; filled the pipe from
the recruiter’s proffered pouch, which he
then attempted to retain. The watchful re-
cruiter smilingly took it from his hand, filled
his own pipe and pocketed the pouch. Then,
calling up the boat-boy who carried the
trade, Speed presented to the chief three
sticks of tobacco, and a new sulu of calico
figured with anchors, stirrup irons and
horses’ heads —as worn in the Philippines.
The chief was speechless at the beauty of his
new raiment; and Speed followed up the
advantage with a speech of non-essentials.
He stated that he had sailed for many days
out of his way to see his dear old friend,
the chief”
“Never met him before in your dashed
life,” said the captain, sotto voce.
“He knows that, and so do I; but I’ve got
to say it. Shut up.”
He went on to say that he hoped the rela-
tions of the chief and himself would con-
tinue in the future as in the past.
“Meaning that you hope to keep on selling
him next to nothing for a lot of money.”
“Oh, shut up, Skip—you’ll spoil my
style! Now then, chief. What name you
ston ?”
“Name belongem me stop Sulefatoi.”
“Sulefatoi! Yes, I forgot. You not for-
get my name? Mark!”
“Marta you stop! What name you want?

“Yes, Sulefatoi, gettem plenty boy.

ZAM-BUK IS THE MOTHER’S FRIEND.
Accidents will happen even in the best-regulated families Healthv
youngsters seem to be always “in the wars.” Housework abounds with
mishaps for busy wives and harassed mothers; and the bread-winner often
returns from work with a more or less serious injury. Just what everv
home needs is Zam-Buk. A pot and a bandage on a handy shelf where thev
are handy for instant use, save untold pain, time and money.
When the little one runs in from his play with a smarting, dirt-filled
scrape on his knee, simply wash the part and smear with Zam-Buk When
father cuts or scrapes his hand, the handy pot of Zam-Buk again meets the
emergency; and the housewife or mother continually finds it a real friend
for the burns she receives while cooking, the scalds of a washing day or the
knocks, etc., of dusting. Children like Zam-Buk because it is cooling
soothing and pleasant. Their elders value it still more highly because it
is also antiseptic and a powerful germicide, preventing poisoning, festering
and disease. Daily mishaps make Zam-Buk a daily need—therefore keep
Zam-Buk handy. ‘ ’ 1
CHILD’S SHOCKING BURN.
ARM COMPLETELY HEALED BY ZAM=BUK.
No matter how careful we may be, accidents
will happen. Mrs. L. Stevens, of 3 Seacomb
Street, North Fitzroy, Melbourne, says:—■
“While ironing' I accidentally put the iron
on my litle girl’s arm, which was extended
across the table. The flesh was seared from
the elbow to the wrist, and the skin all blis-
tered in a shocking manner. The agony
was something awful, and the wound
afterwards broke, presenting an awful
appearance. I took Bertha to a chemist,
who prescribed ointment, which did not
do any good, for, when the bandages were
taken off, the flesh and skin came along
with them, and made her arm worse.
“I had heard so many good reports of Zam-Buk, which impressed me so much
that I purchased a supply and dressed her arm with it. Zam-Buk cooled the
burning pain, and gave her the greatest ease from inflammation and swelling This
was most encouraging, so we continued using Zam-Buk daily, until her arm was
thoroughly healed and well.” *

Baiesi! You come.”
Tie bad called to a mean-looking na.tive ——
the very genius of famine—spindle-shanked
cavernous, all skin and grief and lumpy
joints, lie came very slowly to the chief.
fepeed frowned, as the captain laughed,
and said under his breath: **o Mike'
Look at the pretty little present for a good
child he s giving me. I won’t stand for
this.”
Marta, said Sulefatoi, indicating his
worthless vassal as a thing of priceless value,
this , one Baiesi, good boy. I givem you.
Baiesi, more better this one master you
stop one feller moon lie like you too much.”
ihe all white of Baiesi’s foiling eye—like
the eye of a balky horse —looked at Speed for
a moment; then turned away as if Baiesi
took leave to doubt the all-prevailing love of
the white man growing for a new object in
one moon.
Mark Speed acknowledged the gift with a
gracious wave of the hand ; yet deprecated
it. lie said he knew of Baiesi’s great skill
as a medicine man and sorcerer; but how
could he take such a precious gift from his
friend and father, Sulefatoi V Would it not
be better if he left to Sulefatoi that pearl
of all wisdom, Baiesi, and took instead that
one. lie indicated a big, up-standing, moon-
faced young man who looked as if he had the
strength of a horse, and certainly all the
willingness of that animal to exert it.
‘‘That one Atta. All right! You take.”
And by a nod of the head Atta was ap-
pointed man to Mark Speed or his assigns
tor a term of three years at a salary of six
pounds per annum—payable not in advance
with toed, one stick of tobacco a week,
and two yards of calico per month as a
sulu, free.
The recruiter had noticed three young men
standing shyly behind Atta. and looking at
the white men; and he rightly surmised that
u> secure Atta would secure also liis three
friends.
So, while the dance raged all day with the
chanting and the beating of the drums, the
recruiter went about his work of cajoling
boys to the labor that was not necessary to
either existence or happiness. They came to
him as yokels to an enlisting sergeant; and
their imagination of the new land they were
to see and the romance of distance helped
him.
The captain had made good trade, too, of
sun-dried copra, aigrettes, ivory, nuts and
snail shell; and at dusk he called the re-
cruiter to the boats. Speed wanted to stop,
saying that lie liad only twenty boys ready
tor signing on.
‘Bring ’em now—there’s going to be a big
row to-night. Get aboard.”
“It won’t affect us.”
It might; you never know. Anyhow
keep out of it. Whichever way it goes it
means tisli to your net. The young fellows
are taking sides; and shame will drive the
side that’s beaten to leave the island for a
bit.”
“What’s it all about V”
“The same old cause that drove Adam to
cam his living, and Antony to lose his job,
and sent the reeks to Troy. Nana, they
call her —a brown slip of a thing with a
dat race and too much cocoanut oil.”
Bight! I’ll get ’em aboard. . . .On second
thoughts I 11 leave the lot till the morning,
except the boy he gave me and his three
mates. Atta! All feller boy stop along
dance. I stop along ship. Sun he come up,
I come. Atta and other three feller bov, go
alonga boat, stop alonga ship. Sun he come
up, all feller come back see other feller boy.”
Atta and his three mop-headed friends
entered the boat; the other boys went back
to the dance and the roasting pigs.
By midnight Speed was glad he had taken
the captain’s advice —there was fighting
ashore ; yells and screams, but only of civil
Avar, for the drums did not stop beating for
the dance.
At dawn Mark Speed sent the water-boat
ashore for the seventeen boys he had left
over-night, intending to sign them on before
breakfast, and then go ashore to beat up any
remaining possible recruits once the first
batch were safe aboard.
The boat left the beach with eighteen men,
and other men swimming behind it.
“How many in the water, Skip?” Speed
asked of the captain, who had the glasses.
‘‘One, two, three, four—there’s a lot of
heads together—ten or twelve swimming, and
sixteen or so in the boat.”
“Good business—it ought to be thirty at
least —a hundred and eighty quid ; and’ I’ll
get a few more.”
“I advise you not to try. They’ll soon
repent this row, and the chief might have
some favorite in the lot that’s exiling itself.
Send a present to the chief, right away, and
tell him we have to clear out because plenty
wind come up too much. Beat up to another
island ; you’ve got more than vour average
here.”
“Right—l’ll do it.”
As the men boarded the ship Speed sent
the boat-boys back with some trade-rubbish
as presents; then, seating himself at a little
table on the deck, he signed on the first
seventeen, getting through the job quickly,
and sending them forward to clear decks for
the twelve swimmers.
“Thirty! It's a haul. Now then, first
feller boy!, What name you stop?”
“Rarita,” replied a deep, tragic voice, and
the recruiter, looking up in surprise, saw
the leader of the twelve—a tall, lithe, mus-
cular young man. straight-nosed and clear
and lustrous of eye; so unlike the flat-nosed,
high-cheeked men about him that he looked
more a dark Roman than a native of the
Coral Sea. He spoke with a dignity which
his looks accentuated ; and Speed, seeing a
new wound upon the native’s forehead, took
a crimson handkerchief from the bale of
trade beside him, and said : “More better
tie him up head.”
The man bound his head in the handker-
chief. He became more Roman than ever
What name? Rarita?”
“Rarita.”
Speed gabbled through the formula pre-
scribed by law, while the Captain wrote the
names in the recruiting book.
“How long you want go?”
“Little feller, master. Byemby, one
woman Nana ; I want come back little feller
time.”
“She turned him down for Baiesi, that
scarecrow you refused. She’s frightened of
Baiesi—he’s a sorcerer.”
“He looks it! All right. Put Karita
down three years.”
“One moon I stop, master.”
“Oh ! All right! One moon—two moon
—put him down three years. How many
you, Funny-face?”
The large, chocolate-colored man addressed
replied bashfully, and in a whisper:
“I want three moon—name Wagisi.”
“All right—put Wagisi down three years.
How many you; what name you stop?”
“Pawana! I want two moon.”
“Put Pawana down three years. All other
boy tlu-ee years. You name? —You? —You?
—You? That’s the lot. Now all boy go
that way. I give all feller boy tobacco, pipe,
one sulu—very nice that one. Go forward.
Aly word! 1 plenty kind alonga all feller
b°y-—I like all feller boy too much.”
The wondering natives went forward, com-
forted a little because the white man liked
them too much; the Papuan crew, to the
accompaniment of weird cries, peaked the
anchor, and laid it in-board. The Misima
set sail and stood seaward.
At noon the light breeze died to all but
steerage-way. At one o’clock they were
becalmed in sight of the island; but, four
hours later, an off-shore wind sprang up, and
she made six knots on her course due
westerly.
While they sat at dinner of canned beef,
fresh fish and the fruit of Meredeana, just
before the sun set in his usual hurry, they
heard a long, wailing cry from the deck
forward—a cry involuntarily tuned and
harmonised by the common sorrow. It was
the cry of Karita and his eleven friends,
who had in the first shame of defeat aban-
doned the Blessed Isles for the pains of the
unknown.
*** * .
Mark Speed collected his full complement
of a hundred and fifty, and delivered them to
plantations on the mainland and the islands
near China Straits. Then he went south
with his money.
The plantation that indentured Karita and
Ins friends was on Taroga. Their habit of
living for the moment was rudely changed
to a life of work with an object; they
counted the moons to three, and wondered
they were not returned; timidly asked for
explanations, and had it proved to them by
figures in the sand that three years are three
moons twelve times told. And at that they
had returned to work silently, to fret, to
puzzle it all out —the reason for this mad-
ness of effort and hopelessness. The big
Roman-looking Karita felt it most. He had
more brains and imagination than the others ;
lie saw it the more truly, and he craved for
Meredeana to the marrow of his bones.
And then he asked a white man in what
part of earth or sky the island of Meredeana
might be.
To which the ivliite man replied: “One
ship one moon go that way Meredeana he
stop ; and pointed to the east. Rarita fixed
a bread-fruit tree by the shore to which the
white man's finger seemed to point; he
stared at it long and earnestly, until he
knew that tree from all the other trees in
the world.
A week later they sent him to work at a
place by the nor’-east point of Taroga, look-
ing west.
Mark Speed, who said lie would never
return to the Coral Sea, was there within
four months of the saying. He met the
captain of the Misima in Samarai, and was
very quiet and thoughtful: but that captain
was a wise man, and asked no questions,
lie invited Speed to accompany him on a
mn to Gizo in the Solomons; and the ex-
recruiter carelessly agreed. The Misima had
ten tons of freight for Taroga plantation,
and a freight of copra to pick up there; a
few. thousand feet of timber, and some gal-
vanised iron for a missionary.
At Taroga they met the manager of the
plantation, and stayed with him half a day,
and all night, and till noon of the next day.
“They’re a good lot of boys you brought.
Speed, he said. “But I’ve had a devil of a
job explaining that three moons isn’t three
years.”
“They can’t count,” replied Speed, a little
shamefacedly.
“If they could count a lot of them
wouldn’t sign on, I suppose! There’s a
refined-looking chap, Rarita”
“I remember him—more like a high-class
Arab than a nig.”
“Yes —he asked Smitliers, who was ashore
here at the time they found the meaning of
three moons, where his island was; and
Smitliers pointed due east, right by the tree
on the beach down there. We shifted Rarita
to a new plantation we’re starting six miles
nor-west —Donai we call it—but we can’t
keep the man away from here. By George'
There he is now—off work, too. ’ I’ll start
nun back to liis hoe in the .rubber.”
They advanced behind the big, muscular,
seated figure—thinner than when Mark
Speed had signed him on. His arms were
crossed upon his knees; liis head lowered
yet directed always due east, where Mere-
deana lay, below the sun-haze and the sea

The recruiter laughed as at a great joke

I signed on all those bucks to get enou<>-h
money to go home. And when I go home—

“Don’t laugh like that, Mark—what's ud

“When I got there the cupboard was bare,

money I sent her to marry the other fellow
Home-sickness ! Well! By all the devils in
HeU, that s great! Me and Rarita .' Home-

The captain of the Misima led him away.
Ihe planter looked down at Rarita, whose
eyes were wide open—as if he still sought
with vision to annihilate space, and see
again his home among the Blessed Isles.
