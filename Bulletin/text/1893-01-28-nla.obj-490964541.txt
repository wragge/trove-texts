Dr SPEER has determined to REDUCE his FEES to
exactly ONE-HALF of those usually charged, and he
trusts that this will prove itself

tb those thousands of poor but honest sufferers, who,
though willing to pay a small fee proportionate to their
means are quite unable to pay the enormous charges so
often made.
Dr. SPEER wishes it to be distinctly understood that
his charge is INCLUSIVE, and that when once he takes a
curable case in hand he names a fee which includes all
advice, attendance and medicines until the patient is
completely cured. It therefore naturally becomes his
object to cure his patient as quickly as possible.

Surgeon of the long-established and favourably-
known Dispensary that now bears his name, re-
ceived his medical education and surgical.training
in the leading colleges and hospitals of Europe
He has devpted a life- time to the study of
Nervous Complaints.
He has by profound research thoroughly investi-
gated their origin, traced their deadly sources and
insidious dissemination, and ascertained the surest
and safest methods by which they may be eradi-
cated; with these widely recognised qualifications
combined with unswerving faithfulness to his
patients, he has during his practice, extending
over FORTY YEARS, attained a well-deserved
pre-eminence in their treatment. His practice
embraces diseases which probably cause more un-
happiness than any other class of troubles that
afflict mankind.

such a letter, write you promptly and courteously
a candid and straightforward opinion of your
case. If you do not think you understand your
case, send for his famous medical work, the price
of which is but fid. ; enclosed in the volume

which will assist you materially in describing
your ailments. Dr. Richards uses nothing but
the purest remedies, and never prescribes injurious

The Missing Land-Tax.
Thr New South Wales “Protectionist”
Government—that Government of shifts
and expedients and devious ways and tem-
porary devices—has once more staved off
the evil day, when it will have to act up to
its principles from sheer force of necessity,
and become a Protectionist Ministry in
something more than the name. At the end
of the year it found itself confronted with a
deficiency of about one - and -a - quarter
millions, that amount being partly its own
shortage, and partly the shortage bequeathed
to it by the defunct Pakkes Cabinet. This
financial difficulty is to be met, to a small
extent, by reductions in expenditure, but
chiefly by increased taxation. In the end,
it is most probable that the reductions will
prove a myth, and that the increased taxation
will have to till the entire gap. No Austra-
lian Cabinet, within our recollection, has ever
made any reductions in expenditure at all
worthy of the name. There have been many
spasmodic attempts at economy in times of
stress, by the discharge of public officers who
had no political influence to support them,
and by reductions in the salaries of civil
servants who were not related to any politi-
cians who had 'to be conciliated, but the
instant these economies were effected the
ancient evil always started growing again as
vigorously as ever. If a hundred officials
are discharged—and compensated -to-day,
a hundred politicians—including those who
howl the loudest for retrenchment—will arise
to-morrow, each anxious to find a place for
at least one friend, or relative, or acquaint-
ance, and the Ministry will consent almost
without a murmur. Under the system of
Party Government the Ministry always does
consent; if it does not, its days are num-
bered, for almost every refusal means the
alienation of a supporter. Therefore, the
retrenchment theory is hardly worth con-
sidering. The solvency of New South Wales
depends on the raising of additional revenue,
and obviously the easiest way to raise it, the
one which would cause least distress and do
most good, is by a tax on the one great
interest which has hitherto escaped all public
imposts —the unimproved value of private
lands. But only an excoodinjly strong
Government would venture to propose such
a measure, and (ho Diitss Government is not
strong enough for the purpose. Neither,
apparently, is any other Government which
could he formed out of the political material
just now available.
* # #
So far, the Cabinet has not dared to fulfil
any of its promises except by small instal-
ments, accompanied with assurances of better
things in the future. It has not attempted
to establish Protection on a solid basis,
because to do so means the practical destruc-
tion of the Customs revenue, and it lacks
Courage to face the means necessary to fill
the Treasury when this source of income
dries up. Protection, in its complete and
scientific form, does not produce revenue—it
simply prohibits the importation of the
article protected, and no duty is really and
absolutely protective until it practically
ceases to yield revenue. If the Dxbbs
Ministry possessed the courage of its
opinions it must be prepared _ to face
a shortage of £2,000,000 per annum—the
amount produced by the Parkesian Foreign-
trade tariff-—and nothing save a Land-tax
could adequately fill so tremendous a void.
Not having the necessary courage, it merely
imposed a new revenue tariff, which it falsely
described as Protection, and shunted the
Land-tax into futurity. That was a year
ago, and the Cabinet has apparently
developed no additional back-bone since.
The advent of genuine Protection is again
postponed for another year, and the gap
which the revenue tariff does not cover is to
be filled by a colourless, temporary, non-
committal expedient in the shape of an
Income-tax. The first business of a Govern-
ment is to keep in office, and the surest way
to keep in office is to quarrel with no vested
interest and to take no risks. The attempt
to effect any great or radical reform always
means danger, and sometimes destruction,
therefore the first principle of party politics
is to put oft anything of the kind as long as
possible.
* • 9
The excuse with which the Land-tax has
been dropped over and over again in nearly
every Australian Legislature is that the
Treasury can, somehow or other, crowd
through without it. Such a plea might be
valid if this impost, like the Income-tax and
many others, were a mere device for raising
money, but in reality it is nothing of the
kind. Even if the Treasury were overflow-
ing it would be wanted as urgently as it is
now when every Government in Australia is
tottering on the verge of insolvency. The
first, last, and only real object of the Land-
tax is to break up the unspeakable land-
owning monopoly, and the fact that a heavy
impost of this kind would be a blessed relief
to many a distracted Treasurer is a mere side
issue of comparatively small importance.
Why this side issue is so persistently put
forward is simply that no Ministry in Aus-
tralia wants to break up the iniquitous land
monopoly, and the financial aspect of the
case is the only one which appeals to the
gross, material soul of the local politician.
* # •
The reasons why the Land-tax is essential
are threefold. (1) The enhanced value of
land is almost the only cause of the misery
which now prevails throughout Australia.
Wages, interest and rent—which latter neces-
sarily goes up with the increase in land-values
—are the three great demands on public earn-
ings. These earnings are increasing much
faster than the increase of population ; the
demands for interest are increasing very
slowly, the amount spent in wages per head
of the population has diminished materially
in the last three years, and the exactions of
rent swallow all the rest. The constant rise
in the national rent-bill—a rise which goes
on for ever, in good seasons and in bad—
leaves so little money available for wages in
years of scarcity that Australia becomes a
land of hunger and universal distress. (2)
The great cause of the constant rise in rents
is the hideous scarcity of available land.
There is a land famine in this continent—a
murderous scramble for standing-room, and
already the inhabitants must pay such
exorbitant prices for the mere privilege of
not bebiig crowded into the Pacific Ocean that
wheiji they have bought the right to escape
drowning there is not enough left for the
support, in ordinary comfort, of themselves
and their families. And (3) this earth-
famine is caused entirely by the bowelless
speculators who are everywhere holding the
earth’s surface “ for a rise ” —who are hold-
ing it, not to use it, but to prevent others
putting it to a profitable use—who keep land
lying idle so that the little fragments they
condescend to sell at intervals may fetch ten
times their natural value; and the only
remedy for this evil is the imposition of so
heavy a tax on unimproved values that no
man would willingly keep the earth’s surface
unused and unfilled any longer—any more
than he would willingly hold on to a red-hot
iron.
* * #
The dimensions which this evil has attained
are well-nigh incredible. There is prac-
tically no agricultural land obtainable from
the Government, or at the Government
valuation, within a hundred miles of Sydney,
and comparatively little within 150 mile’s,
yet probably two-thirds of the land inside
that radius is held by speculators who neither
cultivate it nor put it to any other useful
purpose whatsoever, and who only occupy it
to prevent it being used, and to profit by
the artificial hunger thus created. There is
enough laud lying idle within this radios to
feed the entire population of New South
Wales, only the curse and interdict of the
land-speculator rest upon it like the excom-
munication of the mediaeval church, and it
must remain waste until he is paid an
exorbitant price to remove the ban. In
Melbourne and Sydney the overgrown popu-
lation is already stifling for want of space,
and by reason of the increasing scarcity of
elbow-room rents grow more and more
exorbitant and accommodation grows steadily
narrower, yet probably half the land em-
braced within the suburban area of either
city is kept idle for the profit of a few
monopolists who are waiting until the pre-
vailing earth - scarcity grows still more
intense. But the other day an estate was
auctioned within three miles of the centre of
Sydney which had been tabooed for over 90
years by successive generations of land-
stealers, who existed one after the other only
to prevent it being put to any profitable pur-
pose, and to promote famine and poverty
round about. Nor is this an isolated case—
it is but one among hundreds, or rather
among thousands. If a Land-tax is imposed
of such weight that it will be no longer profit-
able to hold the earth’s surface merely for
the purpose of creating artificial want, the
probabilities are that decent agricultural land
within 30 miles of Sydney or Melbourne
will presently be obtainable at £2 or £3 an
acre, and many of the suburban lands which,
under the pressure of unnatural scarcity,
now sell at enormous sinus per foot frontage
will fall 70 or 80 per cent, almost in one act.
* * m
When the city artisan who is crowded into
a malodorous slum because half the suburban
lands are held for a future advance by greedy
traders in human want and misery, and the
hopeless selector who is relegated to the
remote and waterless plains far from any
market or any semblance of civilisation
because ravenous capitalists have laid an
interdict on thousands of acres in the
vicinity of the cities, awake to a know-
ledge of the situation, then the demand
for a sweeping tax on unimproved land
values will become so universal that no
Government can withstand it. But there is
no present sign ut their awakening, and
meanwhile the question is merely one of
expediency. The Cabinet which attempts to
establish such an impost will thereby declare
war against the banks and financial corpora-
tions, against the land-owning section of the
Assembly—where fully half the members are
landlords, against the Upper House, against
capitalism generally, and, in its individual
capacity, probably against itself. These odds
would matter little if the masses were pre-
pared to give a solid vote on the other side,
but apparently they arc not so prepared,
and will not be for at least another decade.
Therefore, Governments potter along one
after the other, with no financial purpose
save to provide for the day and borrow
enough for the day after. The one hope for
some weak and modified variety of Land-tax
in New South Wales seems to be in the pass-
ing of the Local Government Act, but that
has been hanging fire already for a quarter
of a century, and already a suspicion begins
to arise that it may hang fire for a quarter of
a century more, and even then be very little
nearer. Nothing—save the annual deficiency
and the eternal no-confidence motion —ever
does get much nearer in New South Wales.
Bill.
Amid the many social misfortunes of this
distressful land one of the greatest is the
quality of the ambassadors who represent it in
England. They are a motley crowd, and, as a
rule, have proved themselves small potatoes
and few in a hill. Among them have been
Graham Berry, of the Mercantile Bank,
James Munro, and Fitz Gibbon (Fitz means
“the son of,” and Gibbon signifies “a
monkey”), the bard who in the spring-time
lightly turns to thoughts of hogwash, and who
used to bound with both feet on a copy of The
Bulletin in a now degenerate Melbourne club
by way of demonstrating his loyalty to the
“ Hempire.” Australia has also been repre-
sented by Sladen and Henderson Africanus,
and now the name of Plain Bill Holloway
must be added to the list. This celebrated
cart-horse actor went “ ’Ome ” some years ago
and vanished into a great obscurity, from which
he has only just emerged to act the part of a
“representative Australian” in the papers.
There is no law by which he can be bound over
to keep the peace and not be a representative
Australian, so this country seemingly will have
to suffer him as best it may. But apparently
the cable-man imagines that Australia likes
being “ represented ” by the massive William,
for he persists in forwarding scraps of informa-
tion concerning that unreasoning hunk of
humanity, and how he played Kent or Lear,
and how he was cheered by an enthusiastic
audience, for which facts there is no demand in
these parts. Probably he also wonders what
the typical Australian is like when he
is represented by Bill Holloway, and
what kind of man it is that hungers sc much to
know what Bill Holloway is doing—but that
is only another item added to the general mis-
fortune.
* * *
The Bulletin wishes to explain just here
that it has no personal animosity against the
bluff and assertive Mr. Holloway ; it only
desires, on behalf of the Australian people in
general, to repudiate him in his representative
capacity. Otherwise, this country may be held
responsible for his stagey strut, and the habit
he has of folding his arms high up on the roof
of his chest, so that his coat can be distinctly
heard bursting at the seams ; also, for the
moist and fruity gurgle in his voice, which
always sounded as if he had dined exclusively
on fat, fm- his sinful yearning to play Rom no,
ami his tones of sorrow in the final scenes wliera
he used, in so business-like a way, to mourn
over Juliet, and cast his cloak wildly over his
left shoulder, and for his awful and thunderous
laugh in moments of mirth. In fact, The
Bulletin hereby rises to cast off Bill, indi-
vidually and collectively, and to demand that
he should exist entirely at his ow n risk. And
whereas that gentleman has recently been inter-
viewed in London as “the eminent Australian
actor,” and has been found to possess “ the
manner of a great preacher or teacher,” also “a
fresh complexion, a deep, rich voice, and a clear
grey eye,” this paper hereby repudiates all
responsibility for Mr. Holloway’s eye, and
absolutely declines to recognise his complexion
in any way. Only, if a “great preacher”
means a man who preaches a great deal in a
very great voice, then the latest “representa-
tive Australian ” is all there.
* # *
In the course of that same interview the
cloven hoof of the returned “ kawlimst” look-
ing for an advertisement looms forth con-
spicuously, as per the following sample :
“The only actor 1 ever heard say that he disliked ..the
colonies was Herbert Standing,” rema ked Mr. Hollo-
way. “ One can imagine why. The fact is, they’re par-
ticular in Australia. If you are not ‘ passable ’ socially,
you are not a business success. People don’t care to go
and see actors and actresses w hom they coul In’t invite to
their houses. When they know you are all rig! t nothing
is too much to do for you. Fn m Government House
downwards the folks vie with each o'her in showing you
hospitality. Why, when'l was playii gin Sydney a few
years ago, Lord Carington asked myself and my daughters
to Ids garden party, and introduced us to several Lidrops
who were present. That was bringing the Church and
Stage together, wasn’t it ? ’’
The Bulletin rises just here to repudiate Bill
Holloway over again. For, in the first place,
the Australians don’t care and never did care a
straw whether an actor is “ passable socially”
or not; they don’t care whether he is a bigamist
or a Mormon or anything else—provided he can
act. Secondly, Holloway never was specially
and obtrusively passable, so far as the public is
aware, in any capacity whatever. Thirdly,
Government House never broke its neck rushing
to show hospitality to the massive William.
Also, when Governor Carington invited him to
Government House it was assuredly chiefly by
reason of the interest taken by the public in his
clever daughter—or rather, his clever step-
daughter and pupil, Miss Essie Jenyns. Fur-
ther, the writer knows of two servant girls, one
hash-house-keeper and a footballer who shared
the same honour, for things were pretty loose
and haphazard at Government House in Cak-
ington’s time, and that viceroy himself wasn’t
at all particular about the kind of actors he
associated with. In proof of which he once
allowed two weighty Scotchmen to produce, at
the vice-regal home in the presence of a large
company in evening dress, a certain weird and
horrid original opera, in the course ot which one
character remarked that a certain absent indi-
vidual had “plenty of pluck,” and another
character hazarded the opinion that “pluck
was no good without ‘ lights.’ ” The fact that
the patron of this cat’s-meat joke recognised
Bill Holloway is a matter that had better be
dropped into oblivion. Moreover, the fact that
Carington introduced William to “ several
bishops ” may, after all, be only on a par with
the kindness of the host who introduces a poor
and dreary relation to a deaf stranger with a
bad cold, and then leaves them together.
* # #
And here is another choice anecdote from the
cx-Romeo’s repertoire, also told in his capacity
as the “ eminent Australian actor ” :
I remember, by the way, hearing a queer old stage car-
penter they had in Adelaide discussing managers once on
a time. An actor had been complaining of my friend
Harwood’s severity. “ 1 don’t go for to deny,” said the
old carpenter, “that ’ARWOon-is flinty, very flinty, but
’e’s nothing to ’Olloway. I tell you ’e’s a regular
marionette.” He meant “martinet,” 1 suppose.
The Bulletin hereby repudiates the “eminent
Australian ” some more, and utterly casts him
off in his representative capacity, for his ghastly
stupidity. The ancient artisan almost certainly
did mean exactly what he said—that WilLiam
was a marionette. Also that he was a regular
one. A marionette is a thing which sticks out
a wooden arm straight in front of it with a jerk
and a clothes-prop attitude, and there the
stilted Mr. Holloway fills the bill to perfec-
tion. His methods somewhat resembled those
of Crick, M. L.A., when that chirpy legislator
from all the debating societies delivered his
first carefully-rehearsed oration in N.S.W.
Assembly. On that occasion he walked for-
ward with a martial and well-regulated stride,
and hit exactly the same pattern on the carpet
with his hoot-heels at every stride. He drank
a glass of water at exactly the right moment
and put the glass down impressively. He
stuck Iris arm straight out at precisely the
correct instant, and when the proper crisis
arrived he stuck out the other arm. When his
voice became low and impressive he dived his
hands deep down into his pockets, and when
it became loud and denunciatory he threw back
his hair and cast all his limbs adrift. Then he
made a point and the same instant he hit the
table on the point of the jaw, and finally he
walked back to his seat striking his boot-heels
at each stride on exactly the same spots that he
had hit when he made his original advance.
Bill Holloway was built on exactly the same
plan ; he was the drill - master of tragedy.
He might play the same part every night for
six months, and every night, at the crisis of the
tragedy, lie would bring his boot down with a
thud on the same knot in the same board and
never miss once. Provided, of course, the
board didn’t break. Unless Bill’s engagement
terminated, or a new piece was put on which
required him to aim at a new knot, the board
was bound to go sooner or later.
• * #
Once the present writer saw Harry St.
Maur, a gay and joyous actor to whom Aus-
tralia owes a debt of gratitude, playing “ Jim
the Penman ” with a woeful scratch company
and under various other difficulties. At each
interval there were shrieks and dull thuds
behind the scenery, which created an impres-
sion that St. Maur was killing the more in-
capable members of the troupe, and at last a red
and excited star appeared in front, and apologised
for the most particular gibbering idiot in the
gathering because he was “ suffering from severe
pain in the region of the heart.” Then, in his


excitement, lie solemnly put his hand over his
own liver and withdrew. It was the only time
he made a mistake in his anatomy, but William
Holloway, as we knew him, always made
mistakes— he never got his anatomy right by
any possibility. If lie was supposed to be racked
with the pangs of unrequited love, he generally
laid an impressive hand upon his stomach,
IU I w hen death overtook him he clutched
wildly in the direction of his biliary duct.
Also, he was such a slave to precedent that if he
reached for the wrong organ the first night,
he continued to reach for it every night there-
after.
# * »
In case, despite the preceding remarks, there
should still remain any possible room for mis-
conception, The Bulletin gets up just once
more to explain that it absolutely repudiates
t he energetic Mr. Bill Holloway— in his
assumed capacity of a representative Aus-
Indian and all his works, and that if
he continues to pose in any way what-
soever as the mouthpiece of Australian
sentiment, this paper will take legal advice
on the subject. Australia has suffered from
the misrepresentations of many alleged Aus-
tralians, but it draws the line at Bill Hollo-
way. It declines to recognise him either as a
countryman, - as an actor, as the associate of
bishops, or in any other capacity whatsoever.
Bill Holloway, in short, is hereby abolished,
and being abolished there is no longer any such
person. If he continues to profess to exist he
does it on his own responsibility, and must
take the consequences. It is only on rare
occasions that The Bulletin takes the extreme
course of formally abolishing anybody, but in
the present case such a step is absolutely neces-
sary. There are already too many “ represen-
tative Australians ” in the world, and the
addition of Billiam’s mellifluous voice to the
chorus is altogether too much. Also, the
cable-man is hereby informed that Australia
desires no more telegraphic intelligence about
any Holloway or alleged Holloway or his
doings, unless, indeed, he chances to kill
Charles Warner, in which case a brief inti-
mation of the glad event will be gratefully
received. Under all other circumstances he is
requested to draw a veil over the full-blooded
and rotund Bill, and preserve a great silence.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The New South. Wales Deadlock.
Though but half its life is run, the New South
Wales Parliament is practically moribund. For
it is powerless to serve the province, except in
the most perfunctory way. A farce is being
enacted in each branch of the Legislature. The
nominee Council is trifling with the measures of
the Legislative Assembly; and the latter House
is trifling with anything and everything. The
two Houses display most hostile feelings, one
towards the other. ■ Since the advent of the
Labour-party in the Assembly, the nominees of
the Crown in the Council have secreted an
enormous quantity of political bile. The refusal
of the Council to repeal the workmen’s con-
spiracy laws, to redress the grievances of
injured seamen, and to accept manhood suffrage
pure and undefiled, has so embittered the Labour
members, that it is difficult for the Administra-
tion to conduct a Council bill through the
Assembly. For instance, the debate on the
Coroner’s Court Bill—which virtually abolishes
coroners’ juries—had to be adjourned to escape
an adverse vote. The Medical Bill is withheld
from a similar reason ; and, so far, the Govern-
ment has not dared to proceed with the Bill
to suppress larrikinism by the aid of the
flagollator. On the other hand, so irate are
the nominee legislators at the demands of
the Reform party in the Lower House, that
they will avail themselves of any conceiv-
able pretext to thwart the will of the Assembly.
The strong expressions of democratic opinion
which Parkes, with factious motives, recently
provoked in favour of abolishing the nominee
Council have angered the nominees to such a
degree that they cheer, to a man, any suggestion
to "stifle the Democratic voice. Their hopes,
seemingly, are concentrated on a reform in the
curriculum of the State-schools. The Ira-
perially-bebaubled Councillor Coombes com-
plains that the State-school scholars, and
juvenile democracy generally, have no venera-
tion for august personages ; while Councillor
Brown—the Warwick of New South Wales—
goes bald-headed for an immediate return to
the three R’s. Says he :
Our public-school system is rotten in every sense of the
term. The State is not called upon to do more than to
teach people to read, write and cipher. We should do no
more than teach our children so that they may take an
intelligent interest in and be able to observe the general*
welfare of the country as it is disclosed in the daily press.
This Tory sentiment was cheered to the echo
by a House of capitalists whose ambition is to
so order things political and social as to build
up an aristocracy. These men would strike at
the Labour members through the medium of
the State-school, if they had but the pluck to
gratify their venseful feelings. Yet it is pro-
posed by Parkes to strengthen the Council !
No good can come out of the Council until it
represents something besides fat, senility and
property. Wherein do Parkes’ interests lie
just now ? In the strangulation of One-man-
one-vote and the dispersion of the Labour
members. *

The bitter cry of a few interested persons has
been raised against the appointment of a Mr.
Burrows to the supreme command of Mel-
bourne Gaol. Objections to Mr. Burrows are
based on the theory that no “clerical official in
the Law department ” —said B. having acquired
his seniority as clerk of a suburban court —can
properly control the working of prison discip-
line and carry on the traditional management
of criminals. Unless there be deeper reasons
for cavilling at the selection of this gentleman,
his appointment deserves the support of every-
body who can see room for improvement in
prison politics. Burrows, not being hampered
by any prejudices born of martinet associations,
ttiay possibly bring new light into the gloomy
precincts of a stupid old gaol. At any rate,
he is worth trying, as an experiment. A prison,
Where each lodger must do what he is told, and
the bili-of-fare requires no thinking over, is
much more easily managed than a hotel. The
rules and regulations laid down by his pre-
decessors are so plain, that the new man can’t
go wrong if he means to follow them, whereas,
if he earnestly endeavours to improve the moral
tone of his absolute monarchy, he will find
precious little scope for making it any worse.
Prison government, up to the present, is such a
dire failure, that the introduction of an intelli-
gent outsider into the business promises to fill
a long-felt want. Of course, we don’t know for
sure that Burrows is intelligent. He married
somebody’s daughter and has political influence.

Barton claims that—
“ The powers which, in virtue of certain words, are
assumed to be given to the Governor-General and others
under the Commonwealth Bill, are not their personal
powers, except in so far as they act as instruments of the
Constitution—as instruments of that power which
governs the expenditure, which collects the revenue,
which has the power of the purse, and which is therefore
the supreme ruler.”
Mr. Barton surely has instances in his recol-
lection when the leadership of armed forces,
such as it is proposed to confer on the Governor-
General, was sufficient to control revenue.
Possibly, some of the terms of the Convention
Bill arc conventionalities which, in ordinary
times, imply little, but if the Governor-General
choose to interpret them literally, how would
the now New South Wales Attorney-General
act? Would lie advise the people quietly to
submit, telling them that they had accepted
their Federation Constitution with their eyes
open? Or would he assist them to defy “law
and order” and “properly constituted au-
thority ” by taking up arms against “ the
Crown ?”
There is a general kind of newspaper consensus
that Higinbotham was all in the wrong.
Sydney Smith said that minorities are usually
in the right, and, just for once, we will ask
whether it is not possible for this to be true in
Higinbotham’s case. After all, the keynote of
this bugbear to the pious world was that
“Righteousness exalteth a nation.” This
dreamer, this Utopian, this Robespierre,
what did he want ? Why did he retire from
the arena ? He wanted the tree to be properly
rooted. He wanted a start made from the
foundation. Have not events justified him ?
Look at the rotten state of things, and take
Higinbotham for your prophet, in his demand
for Honesty, as the sine qua non ABC. We
will go on tinkering, but we will not have
Higinbothamy. In Victoria they are saying
that a statesman is not required, only a
financier. Just the very thing the French
wiseacres said, in 1789, when they put up
Negker, the banker, as their god, their Golden
Calf. Yet, what a crash ! Miserable Negker
could not appreciate the situation. He raumbo-
jumboed with a report on the finances, which
was to set everything straight, and people
found that finance was the least part of the
whole business. Higinbotham, we declare,
was a practical man—well, like General Gordon,
if the Gordonites want it. Gordon could
organise a capital defence of Khartoum, build
steamers, and what not. He was a crank, but
could do that. Higinbotham was no crank.
He was a statesman, a real surgical one, who
would boldly cut out the tumor.
The poor debtor appears just now to be the
most popular object of legislative compassion.
One Australian lawmaker desires to keep him
out of prison ; another protests against visiting
him with levy and distress ; another rises to
save him from garnishees ; yet another pro-
poses to, at any rate, make his wages unat-
tachable. We are re-enacting by degrees the
substantial part of a New South Wales Order
of ninety-five years ago. “Notice is hereby
given,” ran the Order, “ that if dealers shall be
desirous at any time of accommodating with
credit, it must be wholly and absolutely
upon the strength of their good faith in the
integrity of such debtors, and not under a notion
that they can arrest or imprison by forms of
law.” That was Governor Hunter’s way of
untying the Gordian knot of debtor and credi-
tor. By refusing the latter the use of the forms
of law, the trouble ceased. If a debtor fraudu-
lently contracts debts, or fraudulently avoids
payment, try him for the fraud and punish him
for that. But if, believing in the future, he
incurs debt, he and his creditor are both dealing
in contingencies. If the future deceives, then
let both go down together.

The Imperialistic Dibbs Cabinet is guilty of
political turpitude in not carrying its re-
trenchment policy into high places. In order to
humbug the electors, Ministers propose to submit
to a reduction of five per cent, in their own
salaries. In the case of the six Ministers whose
salaries are voted on the Estimates the reduc-
tion will be compulsory. But as regards Dibbs,
who is paid wholly, and Barton and See, who
are paid chiefly under the Constitution Act,
these statutory salaries can only legally be
reduced by passing an amending bill. In
previous years any attempt to discuss or
interfere with statutory salaries or pensions has
been overruled for obvious reasons. Yet the
Ministers reduce three statutory salaries !
Why? Because, if they sought to amend the
Constitution Act in order to legally reduce
these salaries it would give the Democrats in
the Assembly a chance to reduce the salaries of
the Governor and the Judges and the pensions
of ex-Judges and political officers.
“New Australia ” item from the Sydney
dailies :
It is reported that the executive officers in charge of
the “New Australia ” scheme are in receipt of a cable-
gram from the agent in Buenos Ayres, South America,
which is most unfavourable so far as regards the character
of the country on the Rio Negro, where it is proposed
to form the communal colony. , The cablegram states that
the country is too cold and badly watered. It is under-
stood that the project, so far as the colonisation of that
part of the continent is concerned, is to be abandoned;
but the agents are now making inquiries respecting the
country further north, near Uruguay.
If the above statement is authentic it merely
confirms the view which The Bulletin has
taken all along. This paper has constantly
maintained that no Government would be
likely to give away land unless it was absolutely
unsaleable, and the result seems to prove that
the land which the Argentine Government
desires to give away is not worth taking even
at that extremely low figure. By-the-way,
The Bulletin, a few weeks ago, received a
letter, purporting to come from a well-known
Union official, indignantly denying that there
was, or ever had been, any idea of founding the
new settlement in the Rio Negro district.
The Bulletin will be glad to hear again from
that official any time he feels like writing.
+
In a recent issue, The Bulletin offered a few
remarks about the well-worn “ meejum of
exchange,” and suggested that the “silver
question ” should be settled by the simple
process of letting that blessed metal find its
own level. An N.S.W. country paper —the
person who forwards the extract forgot to give
the name of the publication—replies in wrath
as follows: —
Very well; then Tub Bulletin must drop Protection.
We want bimetallism just for the same reason that we
want Protection. If one is impossible so is the other.
Also, things must “find their own level, whatever that
level may be.” . . . “The Bulletin would suggest
that the melancholy metal,” whose production means
labour, “should be allowed to go down as far as it wants
to.” Also, let wages go down as far as they want to.
For which reason abolish Protection and put no restriction
upon the importation of Chinese and Kanakas! Does
The Bulletin approve ?
Evidently, much consideration of the “ meejum
of exchange” is the short road to insanity.
Protection is the method whereby a certain
measure of prosperity is kept up in a certain
area by protecting it against the competition of
the outside world. Bi-metallism is a device,
whereby the prosperity of the silver interest is
to be kept up all the world over, so, if it has
any relation to Protection, it must mean that
the whole world is to be protected against the
competition of the planets and the fixed stars.
Bi-metallism, in short, is a violent and aggra-
vated variety of Freetrade, and it has just as
much relation to Protection as Hamlet had to
the Schleswig-Holstein problem.
“ Unionist ” writes as follows from Bourke
(N.S.W.):—
In support of a statement, made by me some time >i ice
in a letter to you, classing camels as a nuisance, I wish lo
state that since writing the abovementioned letter, that
several accidents have been caused by those beasts. I
will mention, particularly, two very recent oases. The
Bourke-Hungerford mail-coach was met by a mob A
camels, near Bouike, when tie four horses took fright,
and bolted off the road, wrecking the coach, and laming
one of the horses, besides throwing the driver off the
coach—as luck had it, without injury—also causing a
delay of five hours with the mail. Fortunately, there wei e
no passengers. The Bourke-Barringun mail, when about
four and a half miles from Bourke, on the night of the 7th,
met a lot of camels. The horses at once bolted, the coach
was smashed, the driver and passenger thrown out,
luckily without serious injury. One horse was killed, and
two lamed, and one got away into the bush and has not
yet been found. In Sydney, were a mob of camels taken
through the main streets, as happens here in Bouike,
enough accidents would occur to make the Government
pass an act to prevent the like occurring again.
In answer to which, and several other letters of
the same kind, The Bulletin hereby suggests
once more that perhaps the horse will
get used to the camel in course of time
as he has done elsewhere. If it can’t,
then the horse had better be abolished in the
interior for the camel is much the more useful
animal of thepairundertheprevailingconditions,
and the fittest is going to survive. The nervous
system of the horse has been advanced at
various times as a sufficient reason for the
absolute prohibition of trains, telegraphs,
steamboats, tramways, and other improvements,
hut they all came to slay none the less, and that
badly-scared animal learned to put up with
them. Probably there was a time in the
beginning of history when the horse himself
was objected to because his presence frightened
some kind of primeval goat that was harnessed
to a barrow. Meanwhile the situation is just
this: The camel is a permanency, and if the
white man won’t adopt him then the Asiatic
camel-man is come to stay. Therefore, the
Australian worker is playing into the hands of
that cheap and astute alien and making his
position stronger every day, and the capitalist
is profiting thereby.
The only thing the new Pall Mall
Gazette has borrowed from Stead is “ Our Lady
Commissioner and that plainly isn't the same
one. The new one is of the kind that goes round
and praises the deserving poor for being clean.
Pall Mall Gazette used to pride itself
on its knowledge of things “ colonial.” A para-
graph in a recent issue commends the S.A. Go-
vernment for its alleged intention to extend the
railway system, and hopes that some money will
be spent on the line between Adelaide and
Glenelg, “the port of arrival.” Glenelg hasn’t
been the port of arrival for years, and the line
between it and Adelaide is, and always has been,
in private hands.
Editor Bulletin, —The United States
may with justice “blow” about having no bar-
maids behind the bar, but what about the bar-
maids before the bar? In most American cities,
especially in the West, there can be found a
number of low-class variety theatres termed
“dives,” Admission to these places is usually
obtained by the payment of a small sum or the
purchase of a drink ; frequently, however, there is
no charge whatever. In the body of the
“theatre’’are various small tables at which the
enlightened Yankee sits, and while drinking his
“steam” (beer), lager, or whisky, watches the
performance. Moving among the audience are
the “barmaids before the bar,” young women
whose business it is to, by their blandishments,
cause the frequenters of the place to expend all
the money they have with them on bottled beer
or champagne for the fair ones and their friends.
The women, having themselves procured from
the persons in charge of the bar the required
liquor, personally attend on the customers, and
they receive from the proprietor, in addition to
their wages, a commission on each bottle sold.
All these “ dives ” are hotbeds of vice,
and far more degrading than any Sydney
or Melbourne private bars. Each “ dive ” has
two rows of private boxes running along the upper
portion of the hall, and when a sufficiently gullible
“sucker ” (i.e., fool) is discovered by the women
he is invited by one of them to a box. In a “dive”
the female song-and-dance artistes, when they are
not required on the stage, assist in the great work
of “ blowing in suckers ” (i.c., fleecing fools). They
sell vile beer at one and two dollars a bottle, and
viler champagne at five dollars. Late at night or
early in the morning the affair winds up with a
free-and-easy dance, during which the “suckers ”
are occasionally relieved by the deft fingers of the
“ actresses ” of any “ filthy lucre ” they may have
left. Y &c., S.A.R.

A species of blank despair settled down
all last week on “Falka.” There were great
hollow voids in the vast spaces of Sydney Royal,
and every night the voids grew wider, and the
audience looked more and more lost in the howl-
some emptiness. Why the bright and joyous
opera should have collapsed so definitely and so
horribly no one can tell. The company was
decidedly above the average ; even the defection
of Mr. Leumane did not appreciably weaken it;
and apparently—barring the man in girl’s clothes
—the show was all that could be desired. Also,
the management kept a stiff upper lip to
the bitter end, and the bills, which glared
down out of hollow eyes of ink on the
lost show announced an “immensely successful
run ” in big letters with an energy which ought to
have abolished fate itself. Possibly there has
been too much comedy in Sydney of late, and the
people want something dark and gory with the
great spectral groan-heaver in it, and the mangled
victim with bones protruding through his green
and corroding flesh, and the mystic trap-door, and
the hag of many yellow claws shrieking in the
corridor, and the unburied dead sitting up in the
secret chamber watching the slow procession of the
years out of one mouldering eye that hangs loose
in its socket, and the other eye that has dropped
on to the floor. A company of the heavy and
awful description—with a male manager—might
do worse than try the Royal for a short season,
and put on something of the bony order.
Apparently the Sydney public has a grudge
against lady-managers— at all events, no matter
how excellent the entertainment may be, it
seems to consistently stay away when it
hears that a lady is in charge, and leaves
the poor little woman to go broke. At the
time of writing, The Bulletin is glad to notice
that_ a big matinee benefit for Miss Clara
Merivale is announced for Wednesday (25th), at
which the Royal, Criterion, Majesty’s, Gaiety and
Alhambra companies all bear a hand; and it
trusts that a handsome cheque will eventuate.

Next Saturday, a new company tries its
luck at the Royal with “Uncles and Aunts.”
Messrs. Cannam, Hodson and Diver are the
principal features in the cast, and the first-named
plays Zedekiah Aspen for the 1112th time.

Shakespearian comedy still draws crowded
houses at Sydney Criterion, and so does the roar-
ing of the coster song at the Opera House.
Tommy Hudson opens at the Garrick on Satur-
day, and advertises that his show has been much
patronised by the Juke and Duchess bf Con-
naught and the Nobility of the Far East. The
“ loyal ” and grovelling showman always imports
his geography from Hingland, and he probably
alludes to India in this connection; but unless the
atlas has gone mad the “Far East’’ consists of
Chili and Peru and other beastly Republican
countries thereabouts, and therefore The Bulletin
would urge Thomas to be more explicit.

The gorgeous pantomime at Sydney
Lyceum has come out in a second edition, with
sundry new songs and gags that are more up to
date than the last lot. The gags are a pleasing
feature, but the songs don’t matter so much. No-
body, unless he has the ear of a Red Indian, ever
manages—without the book —to tell what a panto-
mime song is about; in fact, if sufficient variety
were put into the tunes the company might all sing
the same song without anybody being much the
wiser. Mr. Courtneidge’s new joke is the prin-
cipal feature. It is a profound and elaborate joke,
and he tells it carefully to an unreceptive audience,
and then he explains it, and tells it all over again,
and tries, with tears and hysterics, to cast new
lights upon it, like a missionary endeavouring to
expound a Scotch anecdote to a Kanaka. It is a
very long joke, and somehow it never seems to
make much progress.

George Riguold, for . whom the people of
Sydney have been yearning for some weeks past,
reappears at Her Majesty’s on Monday in
“London Day by Day. ” “Bluebeard” expires
on Saturday night to make room for the new pro-
duction. Along with George will eventuate
Cousin Lionel and the ever-welcome Miss Kate
Bishop. Her Majesty’s will now get back to its
old groove, and the baronet’s son who is dis-
inherited owing to his parent’s will having been
lost down a culvert, and the property having been
consequently “shook” by the nearest villain, will
be on tap. once more ; also, the heavy father who
goes around making rough drafts of his curse;
and the military hero who forms himself into a
hollow square on the coast of Africa, with the
women and children and the plunder in the centre,
and gives eighteen cheers, and swears to defend
himself to the last, after which the lost title-deeds
are found in the ear of the principal deceased
insurgent and the property is recovered.

Mr. Frank Smith, of Sydney, the well-
known sporting man, showman, and hotelkeeper
was interred last Thursday at Rookwood ceme!
tery. He was connected for many years with th e
Alhambra Music-hall and Royal Standard; the
former was a successful spec, until the day of his
death, but of late years the old, ramshackle Stan-
dard was extinguished by the competition of
newer structures, and was practically abandoned.
Mr. Smith was probably best known in connection
with the footracing boom, and made a lot of
money out of the famous Botany sports, but
through much “oronk ” running and swelled head
on the part of the pedestrians the boom died a
natural death a year or two ago. A large crowd,
including many professionals, attended the old
man’s funeral, and Mr. King, the Alhambra
tenor, sang a solo over the grave,

A solemn enquiry into the state of the
Melbourne pantomimes last week resulted in the
melancholy discovery that they were much the
same as before. Also, they were doing good
business, the houses at the Royal having increased
to about the same extent as the previous overflow
at the Princess’s had diminished. Moreover, both
Xmas annuals betrayed fitful gleams of a disposi-
tion to wake up and be merry, and though they
were neither of them riotously merry as yet, there
was no telling what might happen to them in
time. Everything comes to the pantomime that
waits—even anew joke now and then.
** * *
“Forty Thieves,” at the Princess, was
“localised up to date” on Saturday, and so
allusions to the change of Ministry naturally
crept into “ Babes in the Wood.” It is indeed
darkly hinted that the rival managements called
upon J. B. Patterson, imploring him to hurry
along with his crisis and provide food for the
hungry funny man, whose feeblest reference to a
change of Ministry would inevitably convulse the
multitude. Anyhow, the political earthquake
came off at an opportune moment, and it is
likely that the Royal will give another
matinee, by special desire, in consequence.
To feel the full force of these remarks
you mqit sit right through a pantomime
and note the effect produced on ordinarily sane
people by the leading comedian’s “gag.” A
mention of Shiels, at a time like this, is considered
infinitely wittier than “Dam !” Now, everybody
knows that “Dam” is a splendid stroke of
humour—on the stage. One of the gravest objec-
tions to the plays of Shakespeare is their entire
lack of “Dam,” and want of reference to local
matters. Just here, too, The Bulletin begs
leave to suggest that the bard’s clowns make a
great mistake in neglecting to stoush policemen
with legs of mutton. Next time that somebody
reads a long paper on “Shakespeare’s clowns”
the leg of mutton theory must be considered in all
its bearings.

Max O'Rell, on arriving at the Bluff
(M L.), was not allowed to proceed direct to
Dunedin, but was waylaid by two speculators who
compelled him to stay and give a couple of enter-
tainments in Invercargill. As Gov. Hopetoun is
about to do Maoriland, R. S. Smythe is hurrying
on Max as fast as possible so that the two celebri-
ties may not clash, especially as Hopetoun is a

Fillis has a notion of establishing himself in Melbourne
and Sydney, ala Hengler. Not a bad idea, perhaps, in a
horsey country.
Frank Thornton, writes The Bulletin’s London cor-
respondent, has a part in Monkhouse and Jacobowsky’s
new comic opera, to be played at the Shaftesbury. He
doesn’t think it will boom, and if not you may expect to
see him before long in Australia with something which,
he says, will knock you all sky-high. In any case, he will
visit Australia again when the Shaftesbury piece has run
its course.
“Charlie’s Aunt,” the farcical comedy by Brandon
Thomas with which little Penley made such a hit last
season in the provinces, is to have a London run at the
Royalty, says The Bulletin’s London correspondent. In
addition to the incomparable Penley, Brandon Thomas
will himself play a part, and Percy Lyndal will make his
first appearance since his return from Australia. Penley,
one of the keenest business men alive, says there is as
much money in the piece as there was in “ The Private
Secretary.” Even if this were divided by four it would
still mean a fortune.
The “ floral tribute” sent by Nellie Farren (Mrs. Soutar
—Soutar is still alive) to the memory of Fred. Leslie
was a heart of white blossoms, pierced with a dagger of
violets. The accompanying card bore the legend, “From
Nellie, a broken-hearted woman," which was, to say the
least, hardly complimentary to her legal proprietor.
Amongst the mourners was Mr. Farren-Soutar, Nellie’s
son. A noticeable feature of the funeral was the large
attendance of ladies.
Fred. Leslie is reputed to have died worth, at least,
£25,000. Had he lived he would probably have lost it all
in a theatrical venture-trying to fit himself, a square
peg, into a round hole.
Fred. Leslie’s death has once more opened up the
question of the drainage of theatre dressing-rooms.
In a Maoriland province the other day a (company of
amateurs, who had learned the words and music of “ The
Bohemian Girl ” in two days, performed it to a crowdedand
enthusiastic house. During the show, the performers
thought it was going so well that they hatched a plot tore-
peat it in a neighbouring town, but the Fates were not to be
trifled with. Having had just enough, they prompted
one of the gipsies to disable the leading tenor by shooting
him with blank cartridge from a pea-rifle. Several old
West Coast diggers said that but for this they would have
almost doubted the existence of Divine Providence.
However, it only put off the evil day, as the tenor got
well (he was not shot in the voice, unfortunately), and
they played the opera for a charity, taking £37. But of
this, £34 went for railway and hotel expenses for the 40
egotists comprising the show. When the Turner Co.
came along, the people said they were not nearly so good
as the amateurs.
“Who says that the Londorr Press cannot be got at?”

“A most barefaced instance of deliberate suppression
happened in the case of the opening of the new Theatre
of Varieties, late English Opera House, on Saturday.
Every London paper, the Echo alone excepted, made it
appear as if everything had been couleur de rose, whereas
the whole evening was noticeable for hostile demonstra-
tions, almost amounting to riot. I do not pretend to
fathom the reasons, or to say what the causes were ; I can
only state facts. Firstly, certain seals advertised as un-
reserved were found to be carefully numbered and
guarded. This set the ball of discontent rolling. Some-
one wrenched one of the barriers off its hinges and
pitched it into the stalls below, fortunately without hurt-
ing anyone. Then the howling and hooting began, and
the audience, instead of listening to the items of the pro-
gramme, set up a concert on their own account, where-
upon Gus Harris had to come out to try and appease the
rioters. However, he only made things worse, and, losing
his temper, made some most injudicious remarks as to
certain demonstrative persons in the front seats not
having paid for their stalls. This was rightly or wrongly
taken to mean that they formed a claque sent in by oppo-
sition managers to ‘crab’ the show. The hooting was
tremendous, and Harris retreated. The evening ended
in the crowd groaning for the manager and the show'.
What modicum of truth there may be in Gus’ insinuations
I cannot say, but there is an undoubted bad feeling
amongst managers of music - halls against this new
venture, w'hich they have been trying to boycott by
securing all the best talent on long engagements. This
experience shows what can be done to square the press.”

A correspondent tells the P.M.G. that: “ One evening,
after the performance of ‘Cinder-Ellen,’ Mr. Leslie was
having some refreshment, when an individual named
M Gregor, described at the time as a Melbourne iron-
monger and a Republican, made some very' offensive
remarks about the Prince of Wales. Leslie remonstrated;
words w'ere quickly succeeded by blows.” This is wrong
side up with care. Leslie insisted upon everybody
drinking the Prince’s health. One man declined, as he
had a right to. Leslie slanged him, and then thought it
necessary in the exuberance of the spirits and his loyalty
to “go for” him.

Purcell, Meston’s partner, read a paper
before the members of the so-called “Royal”
Geographical Society in Sydney last Thursday
night. It was supposed to be on the “pitchery ’’
plant, although why the time-honoured and proper
spelling of “pituri ” should be abandoned we fail
to see, and did not contain much that people did not
know before. The joke of the evening was made
by Professor David, who introduced Mr. Purcell.
It would be information for some of them
to know, 1 he said, “that Mr. Purcell had accom-
Burke and Wills on one of their expedi-
tions in 1861.” Now, as Burke and Wills only
went on the one expedition, of which they made
such a howling and disgraceful mesa, what others
was he referring to? And as Mr. Purcell is com-
paratively a young man, in what capacity could he
nave accompanied those shockingly bad bushmen
the unfortunate explorers in question, thirty-one
years ago? The paper was well down to the
average intelligence of the Geographical Society
especially as it touched on the delicate ground of
the tribal rites practised by certain races, and
contained some touching little yarns that might
have graced a missionary’s speech at Exeter Hall.
General public ignorance engulfs the
subject of the decline of the N.S.VV. tobacco
industry. Sixty years ago, very superior leaf was
grown in the Paterson River district, and such
tine tobacco was there manufactured that the cul-
ture spread to such geographically remote centres
as Williams River, Wollombi, Singleton, Tam-
, an d Albury, and it was not long
before 2o factories were in full operation. Badly
administered excise-law put the first brake on
tobacco-growing successes, and the ruin of the
industry was completed by that anti-Australian
murram the leprous Chinaman, who rakes the
ash-heap of every abandoned white enterprise
and scares off resurrectionists. With the few
white small-farmers who grow tobacco, the fault
is m the defective “curing,” and the negligent
admission of poisonous leaf; with the Chinamen,
a bastard heavy leaf is purposely grown for weight
and fraudulent profit, and the “curing” is carried
omunprotectedly in the midst of Asiatic abomi-
nations. Considering the enormous volume
possible to this industry, the employment it would
provide to hundreds of hands, and the wealth it
would secure to the country, the N.S.W. Govern-
ment might do many worse things than import
from America a real tobacco-expert, and otherwise
encourage the cultivation and manufacture of
the weed.”

The new formation in Peak Hill Proprietary
mine is now described as worth 14dwls. Why this decline
from loz. ? It would also be well to know how either one
or the other estimate has been arrived at. After inter-
secting 80ft. of this auriferous dirt a body of hard quartz

given in haste have been repented at leisure. It is
whimsical to read the official report wherein the number
of grains forming the different assays are given ; and to
remove any possible shadow of doubt whatever, the com-
petence of the assayer is emphasised. It is not the assays

neither does the 10 per cent, give out. Also, nobody
ever seems to embezzle any money from it, and it always

What has really happened at the True Blue ?
Will the management candidly explain ? That something
unexpected has occurred is quite evident. From London
we have received a broker’s circular dealing with the
principal Croydon mines, in which it says of the True
Blue: “Things are working smoothly now, and regular
dividends may be looked for shortly. By the mail
received to-day our manager states that the reef in the
lowest level is six-feet thick, and there should he no
difficulty in paying regular dividends. Shares are 12s. in
Sydney.” Shares are now ss. in Sydney, and Bananamen
take care that there is not a dump of that size unless for

all right. It had all the “ surface indications ” of a
Broken Hill, like the rest of the “ Wild Cats.”

Maritoto, too, has at last been effaced from the
list by liquidation. It was a Sydney-owned Maoriland
mine, reported on by Australian “experts," who ought
to have repented in sackcloth and ashes. The wailing
and gnashing of teeth, however, has been done by the
shareholders. Shares (100,000) went to 355., and might
have even gone higher had not the local shareholders sent
over a ship-load and hawked them down to as many pence.

One of the pioneers of the Randt gold-field,
South Africa, a Mr. Goodman, has visited Pambula,
N.S.W. He, it is published, “marvels that the public
does not realise what a splendid oullook the field has as a
gold-producing centre.” He is confident that if such a
property as Mt. Gahan were found in Johannesberg at
least £1,000,000 would be asked for it on the London
market, and he regards the Faulkner mine as a veritable
wonder. It is true the Mt. Gahan crushings have come
from a big formation, but it is said by miners who have
worked there that the formation below the 100 ft. level is
poor ; that there is no length of good stone even above
that level, and that although the shaft has been sunk some
200 ft. below, the gold has not yet reappeared. If these
statements are incorrect then why are the shares in a
dividend-paying mine down to 6s. and the capital only
£45,000 ?

The New Baker’s Creek North has struck the

which is slowly but surely dipping in that direction. The
shaft and other works have been well laid with that
object in view.

Some more startling news of the silver-find in
the district of Goulburn—plenty of lead, but, so far, very
little silver. Mrs. Dalglish, the Barrier millionairess,
once lived in Goulburn, and the manner in which riches
were thrust upon her has inoculated many Goulburnites
with the silver fever; bitter experience alone will cure
them. Nathless, The Bulletin will not withhold a wish
of equal good luck. It is the least thing we can offer,
and it is very cheap.
It is now proposed to reduce the N.S.W.
prospecting vote to £20,000. Why, in the light of experi-
ence, have it at all? Where, in the whole of Australia,
is there a big dividend mine —the result of direct State-
aid? and even half-a-dozen fairly good mines would be no
equivalent for the hundreds of thousands thus wasted.
The manoeuvres by which some mining amateurs and
loafers secure an easy living under the guise of the pros-
pecting vote are simply disgusting. Cases are known
where contracts have been let to do the work at less
money than the amount granted, which is supposed to
cover only half cost. Under our political system it is
simply impossible to get such a vote honestly distributed
where it will do most good.

Seventy-eight calls were made in the prospecting
stages of the Star of the East mine, Vie., ere the big
quartz-body they are now working was met. One large
shareholder, who now represents the constituency in
Parliament, has held on from the time theco. was started.
Over £20,000 was spent before they received a dividend.
In the latter part of ’B6, they struck the present run of
gold at the 660 ft. level, and have since distributed in
dividends about £250,000, and a like amount in wages,
machinery, and supplies. Most of the gold is now coming
from below 1000 ft., and the mine is so well opened out that
several years of work and tons of gold are in sight. The
battery consists of 100 heads ; the reef runs from 10_to 50
feet wide, and averages 12J dwts. to the ton. It is the
tonnage that tells. The market price of the shares is a
little more than the mine has returned in dividends in
five years—£l2.

The Ophir Block Claim, Croydon, which in

900 tons quartz, is worked by a party of tributors, and was

New Hargraves, as here predicted, a flash in
the pan : 22 tons for 37 ozs. What has become of the
heap of specimens displayed in Sydney windows? Have
they all been used up in these sick crushings? If so,
there must have been more gold brought to Sydney than
left behind.

“A consignment of 300 loads seconds and
mullock from the Pambula mines returned 149 ozs. of
gold.” Seconds and mullock ! ! All poor ore at Pambula
is seconds and mullock. Why not state the tonnage of
the loads ? It is only a half-oz. per load, anyhow, and
each load was a three-horser.

W. A. is coming rapidly forward as a gold-pro-
ducer. It turned out a quarter of a million in gold last
year—an increase of over 30 p.c. on the previous year,
Murchison was on top with £BO,OOO, Yilgarn next with
£73,000. The bulk of the gold so far discovered is pretty
far inland, and often, after finding and working rich
deposits, miners have to “get back” to escape death
from thirst.

Tasmanian mining statistics show that the total
mineral exports for last year amounted to £515,697. Gold
and silver show an increase for 1892, the former being
£148,284 as against £133,013 in ’9l, and the lat ter £76,619
as against £62,138 in the previous year. Tin shows a
slight decrease. The total for 12 years’ export of gold-to
date gives a return of £1,807,444 ; that for 14 years yield
of tin, £5,592,149. The gold output for the past four
years has steadily increased.

At the Bar.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
(Respectfully dedicated to some few dozen Junlors.J
When the youth is fresh from College, and his
head is full of knowledge
Of the musty ancient classics, and he’s taken his
degree,
He no doubt has an ambition to achieve a high
position,
And his father thinks the mission that will suit
him to a T
Is the Bar.
Is the Bar, to which so many go, alas, without a
penny,
More than care and strictest living, but a bare
subsistence giving,
Render rather more than meagre, with a hungry
look and eager,
And who lunch off bread-and-butter and the
simple cup of tea.
Then he either buys or borrows, what will cause
him many sorrows,
The too solid tomes of Stephen, Story, Black-
stone, and of Coke,
And with these and many others all his scholar-
ship he smothers
With his dry and heavy feeding doing little else
but “soak.”
After doing his probation he proceeds in trepida-
tion
To a stiff examination that ’ere now has plucked
a few,
Then a week of anxious waiting ’till he’s joyously
relating
To his fond and happy parents and his cronies
that he’s “through.”
They consider him a treasure, and he takes a little
leisure
As he flings aside his Chitty and prepares to
have a spree;
Just a week or so of “ spelling,” every thought of
books repelling,
Till the time when he’s admitted (and he’s
“ moved ” by a Q.C.)
If his youthful head is level, he will next proceed
to devil
For a senior who supplies him with a lot of
work to do,
And in time all leisure spurning he will find he’s
slowly learning
How to plead, and fills his notebook with a
precedent or two,
Till at practice quite aufait, as he thinks, there
comes a day
When he’s occupying chambers with his name
upon the door,
And he buys a chair and table, gath'ring all the
books he’s able,
With a pen and ink and paper and his carpet on
the floor.
A belltopper’s now de rigucur, and the counsel’s
youthful figure,
Berobed, is seen at levees, or the first day of the
term,
But too few, alas, the chances of evoking envious
glances
As he, brief in hand, to Banco goes with steady
step and firm.
But he waits in expectation that a friend or a
relation,
Some attorney most confiding will contribute to
his rent,
And will cause him some emotion, with a little
“ Brief on motion ”
Just a drop into the ocean of the coin that lie
has spent.
He has no decided bias for Divorce or A isi Prius
Or for Bankruptcy or Equity, but takes ’em as
they are
(What a fool he’d be refusing), and it’s really most
amusing
That the Probate Court’s the nursery of the
very junior bar.
And outsiders cannot tell how the little “ leave to
sell,”
Or the “ Probate ” cheers the spirits in a dull,
desponding life,
When he’s v seated at his reading, and his pipe he’s
ever feeding,
Till the atmosphere’s so heavy you can cut it
with a knife.
So he sits and reads and muses, nor by any chance
refuses
With the everlasting solace of the weed to
banish care,
And each knock he analyses, but they're none of
’em surprises,
Only restless friends who enter and still more
pollute, the air.
Oh, the waiting, sad and weary, in the chambers
dark and dreary !
Oh, the days of endless “grafting,” but without
the least returns,
While outside all’s push and hustle in the city’s
din and bustle,
But it’s no use moralising, by experience he
learns.
So he goes through his probation, months and
months of weary waiting,
But proverbially “ long the lane that never has
a turn.”
With a few small briefs entrusted, ere his mind
has wholly rusted,
He will find his hopes returning and his soul
with ardour burn.
Thus, at length, when near despairing, and his
creditors arc swearing,
He may form a sort of practice and his friends
devoutly bless;
And it lightens his misgiving in re how to make a
living,
And he’s sometimes led to cherish hopes of
ultimate success.

The heavily State-subsidised Sydney

pool and pyramids.
“University degrees,” says one Muir, of
Auckland (M.L.) Education Board, “are a sort of
mechanically - stuffed educational sausage-skins.
They are carefully stuffed and stoppered to pre-
vent the escape of the information inside, then
labelled 8.A., M.A., or LL.D., and put on the
market. Some of them are engaged as teachers,
some are sent to the lunatic asylum, others to the
cemetery, and the balance are let loose on the
public.”
An American philosopher on Salvationism :
“When they know the great adversary of souls
as well as I do, they will not try to scare him
with a cross-eyed woman, or drive him and his
host by beating a tambourine, and the landlord.
Humanity, charity, soft soap, and unselfishness
will do more towards giving Satan that tired
feeling than all the loud and onion-flavoured
hosannas of misguided men and bleating women,
who seek to harass the hosts of hell with a bass
drum, while their own children, with empty
stomachs and unlaundered noses, weep at home.’
Attention is drawn to The Bulletin
“ Missing-Word” competition announcement on
page 6. For the benefit of intending competitors

Competitions have already been numerously

Two rich, elderly ladies described as
being “ eccentric ” from Canterbury (M.L.),
recently put up for the nigh£ at Watson’s Hotel,
Dunedin, and made a memorable sensation.
Apparently, their mental derangement took an
acute form about 4 a.m. —their speciality was a
conviction that somebody always wanted to break
into their premises, and, possibly, their unhinged
intellects finally broke down through hearing the
attendant coming round for their boots in the small
hours. At all events, a policeman, who was
thinking hard outside the Colonial Bank, was a
good deal staggered about daybreak by the spectacle
of two old ladies sprinting down the street in a
night-dress apiece, each shrieking “ Murder ! ”
and firing off a revolver promiscuously. He
called another policeman to help him, and, after
getting badly scratched and clawed, they secured
a scantily-attired old lady apiece and blushfully
ran them in. Or, to be more accurate, they carried
them in, for the distracted females refused to
walk, and as they couldn’t reasonably be dragged
the officers made a procession of two up the street,
each with a demented old maid hugged tightly
under his arm.
The Bulletin does not seek to account
for the resignation of Governor Jersey beyond the
commonplace statement that he has at last tired
of what must have been always (especially to Lady
Jersey) distasteful surroundings. The move
seems the natural corollary of numerous past inci-
dents that were at the time considered too insig-
nificant for special notice. The theory that Gov.
Jersey “took the huff” because Dibbs usurped
the vice-regal prerogative of calling meetings/)!
the Executive Council scarcely harmonises with
the well-acknowledged easiness of good-nature
peculiar to the Governor; nor can many people
imagine that G. Republican Dibbs, the latest
bebaubled pet of Albert Edward and the
British aristocracy, the man whose holy of-
holies is now England and the Peerage, might,
could, would, or should have dared to hope-
lessly affront the roseate shadow in N.S.W. of
Queen Victoria. There is some speculation as to
whether trouble may have arisen through the
Government having hinted its intention to swamp
the Legislative Council in the interests of the
Electoral Bill. However, the only present cer-
tainty is that Governor Jersey has resigned, and
is expected to leave N.S. Wales by February
25th. He landed in Sydney on 15th Jan. ’9l, or
a little more than two years ago. For further
solution of the conundrum cherchez la femme
which means, in this instance, question Lady
Jersey.

The one thing noticeable about Director-

Chief Justice
Madden, it is
alleged, never
takes notes. When
conducting a case
he always had a
book before him —
any book would
do —and when his
opponent made a
point that requir-
ed to be answered
he would fold
down the corner
of a leaf. Then
he would rise to
reply with the
book in his hand,
and as he disposed
of each point he
solemnly straight-
ened out the leaf.
He never seemed
to forget what
each one signified,
and never missed
one. Sometimes
he would have a
dozen leaves
turned down sig-
nifying so many
legal questions to
be dealt with, and
if he wanted to
begin by demolish-
ing the second
last one he would
turn to leaf eleven
and go ahead.
One theory is
that he is guided
by his sense of
smell, an d that
he knows each
legal point by its
odour.

Justice Madden

that letter of Williams’s had to appear.
“ What price a Chief Justice with a black
eye?” So asks a Melbonrnito after reading of
Madden’s fistic prowess. One day, years ago, a
Judge’s associate, in Melbourne, had a black eye,
and it made the court laugh to sec him turn the
right side to his Honor.

Mr. E. S. Cracknell, the late N.S.VV. Superintendent of
Electric Telegraphs, whose decease was announced in Mon-
day’s Register, wasone of the pioneers of telegraphy in Aus-
tralia, and moreover was once connected with South Aus-
tralia. Mr. Todd (Mr. Todd), the Postmaster-Genera', keenly
feels Mr. Cracknell’s death, for in the early days they were
great friends; in fact, it was Mr. Todd (Mr. Todd) who
introduced Mr. Cracknell to Australia. Mr. Todd (Mr.
Todd) says that when he (Mr. Todd) accepted the appoint-
ment to South Australia, which was offered by the
Colonial Office, through the Astronomer-Royal (Sir G.
B. Airy), he (Mr. Todd) was authorised to select four
assistants. He (Mr. Todd), however, recommended that
he (Mr. Todd) should select one good assistant who should
take charge in the event of any accident to himself
(Mr. Todd), and that he (Mr. Todd) should teach
other assistants on his arrival. That was approved,
and he (Mr. Todd) recommended the appointment of
Mr. E. C. Cracknell. They both (Cracknell and Mr.
Todd) came out in the Irene in November, 1855.
The first telegraph-line laid down by the Govern-
ment was from Adelaide to Port Adelaide and the
Semaphore. It was opened in the earlier part of
1856 just after a line was constructed hy Mr.
James Macgeorge, which the Government after-
wards bought. The next line was from Adelaide to
Gawler, and in 1856 Mr. Todd (Mr. Todd) submitted a
scheme for the connection of Melbourne and Adelaide
by telegraph. He (Mr. Todd) went to Melbourne to
arrange with the Victorian Government, and having
brought his (Mr. Todd's) negotiations to a satisfactory
issue, he (Mr. Todd) returned overland and fixed the route.
Then Mr. Cracknell, under Mr. Todd’s (Mr. Todd) direc-
tion, laid down the S.A. section of the overland line.
In 1857 they were beginning to introduce the tele-
graph system in New South Wales, and Captain Martin-
dale, then Commissioner of Internal Communication,
wrote to Mr. Todd (Mr. Todd), asking if he (Mr. Todd)
could recommend anyone to take charge of the Tele-
graph Department in New South Wales, and ns there was
then hardly room for two telegraphists in South Australia,
Mr. Todd (Mr. Todd) recommended Mr, Cracknell, who
secured the appointment, which he has since held. It is
interesting to note that Mr. McGowan was the first to
introduce the telegraph / to Australia in Victoria in 1854 ;
and it says something for the enterprise of those days that
within two years an overland wire was constructed. Mr.
McGowan, like Mr. Cracknell, has died, and Mr, Todd
(Mr. Todd) is the only one of the three pioneers in the
Australian electrical world still living.

Have You Rheumatism?
This is the time of the year when rheumatism
particularly asserts itself. It is a trouble which
can never be cured by lotions or any outward
application. Relief may be obtained by them,
but that is ail. Rheumatism is a disease of the
blood, and to cure it you must go to the source of
the complaint—the kidneys. There never was a
person afflicted with rheumatism, who had not
diseased kidneys. Put the kidneys in complete
working order, and the disease can be eliminated.
Great success in treating rheumatism has been
secured by using, alternate weeks, Warner’s Safe
Cure and Warner’s Safe Rheumatic Cure.
Mr. Robert Falla, of Westport, N.Z., under
date 23rd September, 1892, writes as follows ;
It is with much pleasure and gratification that I
give my testimony to the wonderful effect War-
ner’s Safe Remedies have had on me. About 18
months ago I was seized with a sudden attack of
rheumatism in my great too, and although other-
wise in the best of health, I could not walk with
the pain and had to lay up for six weeks. Dur-
ing that time I was continually under the care of
the best doctors, but the enemy gradually shifted
to both feet and knees, and I became reduced
almost to a skeleton. After trying a hundred
so-called cures and prescriptions without any
beneficial results, the doctor advised me to try the
hot springs—nothing would cure me, he said, but
the baths. I suffered intense agony from the
complaint while being carried to and from the
steamer. The Te Aroha baths, I must admit, did
me a great deal of good, but I left for home again,
after six week honest trial, not by any means
cured. After getting home I managed to attend
to business, with more or less suffering and misery,
until I was induced, by reading your pamphlet, to
try the Safe Remedies. I bought a bottle of Safe
Rheumatic Cure, and found it did not agree with
me, leaving a sick feeling after each dose. Not to
be daunted, I took two bottles of the Safe Cure as
directed, and then went back to the Rheumatic
Cure, and the effect was wonderfully good. I
began to feel as I had never done for month ■■. I
could walk upright. The pain left me and I have
been well ever si.nce. Speaking of the benefits 1
have received, I am a walking advertisement for
your Safe Rheumatic Cure combined with the
Safe Cure.—(Signed) Robert Falla, Westport.

Another grateful man writing from Mary-
borough, Queensland, November 11th, 1892,
states: —I have been a great sufferer from rheu-
matic pains brought on through working in the
wet mines of New Zealand and elsewhere. The
attack would come on during the winter season
and lay me up for two or three months at a time.
Three years ago I used Warner’s Safe Rheumatic
Cure —about two bottles—and since that time I
have been quite free from all pains of a rheumatic
nature, and am in better health generally.—

Some member should move that the

In the first session of the existing N.S. W.
Parliament, Jones, of Mudgee, was frequently
mistaken by the tellers for Hutchinson, of Forbes.
The electors wanted to know why Jones voted
against his principles ; and his troubles with his

idea of making himself appear as different from
Jones as he could. And that is just how. Hutchi-

Where was Berry in the Higinbotham

reminded him of his big mistake when, huffed at
being left out of the M’Culloch Cabinet, he played
into the hands of the “Constitutionalists,” and
was ousted from politics.
The Shiels Government was charged by
J. B. Patterson with every fault save the three
that admitted of no satisfactory explanation—the
sending “ home ” of Munro, the dismissal
of Speight on false pretences, and the inglorious
attempt taavoid a prosecution of the respectable
bank-schemers. In fact, the birth, life, and
assassination of the Shiels Ministry were alike
disgraceful incidents in Victorian politics.
All the most powerful opponents of
Imuerial Federation in N.S.W. have been silenced.
Dibbs, bought over with the paltry prefix that
gilds an undistinguished name, turned up without
his pants to vote for it; Reid, in order to solidify
his party and retain the leadership, somersaulted;
and Want?—well, like Traill, he stayed away.
Absentees may think not to alienate the support
of those who are Federationists at-any-price by
abstention from voting, but how about the votes
they’ll lose from those who won’t swallow the
Draft Bill no matter how sugar-coated ?
The story goes that in one of the Australias
an individual, lately appointed as an^ inspector of
the State Agricultural Department, one day
visited a sugar plantation, and so speedily exhibited
his ignorance that the locals determined to hoax
him. They out down some young bamboos,
chopped them into lengths and submitted them to
him as sugar-cane. “ What do you think of
them?” they asked. “The finest cane I have
seen for a long time,” said he solemnly. Next
day he added, “ The juice has the best density
within my experience.”
“As a matter of fact no Governor of any
leading colony can live on his salary, and non e
attempt it,” says a writer in a Sunday paper.
Perhaps not. But the key-note to the manner in
which Australia should deal with its governors
was supplied' by the U.S. President Jackson,
who, when he went to open the Congress of his
mighty nation, rode up without ceremony or beat
of drum on his old white horse, and hitched it to a
post with his own hands, and when he had finished
his business simply remounted and rode away.
‘ ‘ The Income-tax in South Australia: how

only persons who don’t pay income-tax in South

missness in this respect by furnishing the depart-
ment with the names and salaries of their clerks.
They are determined that the clerks shan’t cheat

approximate estimate of their income, but make
huge deductions from it under the elaborate
schedule of exemptions, which nobody but Com-
missioner Russell, its inventor, ever could under-
stand.
Mr. W. M. M. Arnold, son of a late
N.S.W. Speaker, after contributing £lOO to the
N.S.W. Civil Service Superannuation Fund,
retired in the prime of life on an annual pension
of <£l9o from a sinecure in the parliamentary
service. Loss of memory is alleged to be the chief
cause of his retirement; but his memory is trusty
enough to permit him safely to fill the role of a
broker; and he believes it is good enough to
entitle him to a seat in the Legislative Assembly,
rumour crediting him with an ambition to serve
his country in the Speaker’s chair as his father
did, until the old gentleman sacrificed his life
while endeavouring to rescue some stray pumpkins
from a swollen river.
Dear Bulletin,— ln Queensland the post
of Returning Officer is purely honorary. Atone
time R.O.’s were allowed to sell the electoral rolls,
and retain the price thereof. Latterly, the money
for rolls sold has had to be remitted to the
Treasury. A circular is now issued to the effect
that Is. per copy must be remitted before any rolls
are sent! The Act requires R.O.’s to supply rolls
on demand at Is. In addition, therefore, to the
performance, gratis, of arduous and onerous duties,
a Returning Officer is now supposed to invest.his
private funds in rolls to supply the public, with
the almost absolute certainty that he will have to
lose to the extent of unsold copies ! This is, so
far, the champion act of Government meanness !

Dear Bulletin,- Your suggestion that
that ridiculously overpaid personage, the N.S.W.
Sergeant-at-Arms (=£sso a year), be superseded by
a common bobby reminds me that when £ £
Smith assaulted J, D. Wood in the Vic. Parlia-
mentary refreshment-room, the former took refuge
in the Assembly chamber, the House being then
in session. Attorney-General Ireland —Wood’s
colleague, who witnessed the assault rushed
frantically for a policeman, and, having found
one, brought him to the door and desired him to
follow. The officer point blank refused. “ I
daren’t, sir—the Speaker would lock me up.”
“ But I am the Attorney-General and I order you
to go in and arrest him.” “I couldn’t help it,
sir, if you were the Chief Justice.” Ireland, non-
plussed, brought the policeman’s conduct before the
Speaker, but'was only laughed at for his pains.—

N. S. W. Treasurer See heralded his cheese-
paring policy by authorising the State Printer to
print, at a cost of three half-crowns per copy, a
departmental report which is a travesty on
retrenchment and an insult to the province.
Imagine a ponderous Blue Book accompanied
by 74 photographs of 69 public works, conceived
and executed (and probably photographed) with

dour of Gov. Jersey’s drawing anddining-rooms, the
luxurious rooms of Ministers, the grandeur of the

Who stole N.S.W. Premier Dibbs’ clothes
the other night when he was sleeping in his
Ministerial office and was sent for in the small
hours of a.m. by Toby Barton to save the Cabinet
from a defeat on the Common-link Bill? The
clothes must have been stolen, or else Dibbs must
have been in such desperate need to save his
political bacon that he could not run the risk of
delaying a few seconds to make his toilet. Once
Dibbs was ordered by Speaker Barton to remove
his skull-cap as he crossed the Chamber. What
would Mr. Barton have done had Dibbs crossed
the floor wearing only slippers, night-shirt, and
great coat ? But Speaker Abbott showed no sign.
No wonder, indeed, that Dibbs got a cold in the
small of his long back and had to absent himself
from the House on the next sitting night. Some
members wondered, too, why Dibbs did not take
his seat at the head of the'Treasury benches; and
they wondered still more when they saw Toby
Barton rise and move that the House adjourn.
Those in the “know,” however, were aware
that had Dibbs arisen in his proper place he
would have exhibited a goodly portion of his
figure to the galleries.

The Special Correspondent of the Pall

Mark Twain tells the story that, at the
inquest held on the body of Buck Fanshaw—who
during the delirium of a raging fever had taken
arsenic, shot himself through the body, cut his
throat, and jumped out of a four-storey window,
breaking his neck—the jury, after due delibera-
tion, sad and tearful, but with intelligence un-
blinded by its sorrow, brought in a verdict of
“death by the visitation of God.” Buck un-
doubtedly committed suicide, and so does every
one who neglects the first symptoms of approach-
ing sickness and disease. Nature always gives
ample notice of any disturbance of physical pro-
cesses ; sometimes it is neuralgia, sometimes a
sharp, shooting pain in the abdomen or side, or a
dull or throbbing headache; no two persons get
the same symptoms. What you have to do is to
attack the first symptoms, for if consumption,
dropsy, cancer or Bright’s disease once gets a
start, you cannot stop their headlong course to the
grave. These are facts there is no disputing, for
all the medical skill in the world cannot do much
for you when real organic disease has set in. W e
emphatically recommend Clements Tonic because
we. know by personal experience and by the
evidence of influential and reliable people who
have used it that it will do good and prevent
disease. Clements Tonic is a medicine that in-
vigorates and strengthens the entire corporal
organism ; it does not only affect certain members,
but strengthens the whole system, thus prevent-
ing the attacks of disease. The assertions of the
manufacturers are borne out and proved by James
D. Johnston, Esq., pharmaceutical chemist, 96
Elizabeth-st., Launceston, who writes I have
much pleasure in informing you that I have sold
retail over 5000 bottles of Clements Tonic. lor a
small city of 15,000 inhabitants like Launceston
this is extraordinary, and far exceeds my_ sales of
any other patent medicine in the same time. Ib
could not be done if the preparation was not a
first-class one, and gave great satisfaction. In
neuralgia it acts like a charm, and for general
debility and all cases where an invigorator is
indicated it is superior to any preparation with
which I am acquainted. It is an elegant and
scientific pharmaceutical compound, pleasant to
take, and suitable to most delicate stomachs. I
find it is a genuine article, and not a mere stimu-
lant, as it contains no alcohol or anything in-
jurious, and is composed of some of the most
valuable drugs in Pharmacopoeia. I have a very
high opinion of Clements Tonic, and always re-
commend it to my customers.—l am, dear sir,
yours very truly, James D. Johnston, pharma-
ceutical chemist, 96 Elizabeth-street, Launceston,
Tasmania. „ ,

Coroner Youl, of Melbourne : “ Establish
a foundling hospital, and it will be necessary to
have a travelling cart to pick up the babies.” As
it is, we have to have policemen to pick—and
shovel—up the babies. The question is, Dr. Youl,
how do you prefer to pick up the babies, dead or

Recently there appeared
in the Evening Standard a
series of articles upon “ Spirit-
ualism in Melbourne.” The
writer thereof specialised in par-
ticular a Prahran medium, and
among the many curious who
descended upon her in conse-
quence was one of Gov. Hope-
toun’s relatives, who visited
the medium incognito. Her
disguise, however, failed suf-
ficiently in its object for the
lady to return to Government
House with probably a “deep
conviction,” for a day or two
later a “command” followed
from the Governor, politely
inviting the medium’s attendance
at G.H. for the purpose of
giving a stance. In reply, the
Prahran sybil stiffly informed
the Governor that “ she would
be happy to entertain his wishes
—at her own private residence.”

No end of cheap advice was tendered
Acting-Premier Homburg (S.A.) over that Baker-
Kingston duel-clia’lenge episode. Chief Justice
Way, and nearly every politician living near
Adelaide, called upon him on the matter.
Premier Downer now alleges that had he been in
Adelaide he would have pressed the prosecution
of Kingston to its bitterest extreme. “If it had
been my own brother, 1 must have done it.” A
cheap piece of Draconian bombast, and not par-
ticularly generous to his first lieutenant, who took
all responsibility and didn’t even divulge the fact
that Downer privately telegraphed from Mel-
bourne directly opposite instructions on two
successive days.

The very newest in “In Memoriams.”
From Bombala (N.S.W.) Times : —
A recent Sydney divorcd is about to try
his luck again in the matrimonial lottery.
“Darling,” he said, softly, “I look to you—a
woman—to heal the wound inflicted by another
woman.” She nestled her curly head on his
shoulder, and looking up into his eyes with her
own bright, soulful orbs, timidly answered,
“ Rye-buck or words to that effect. We have
read it all before somewhere. The late co-
respondent, by the way, is in trouble at present,
somewhere down the South Coast.

A FACT.
SQUATTER : “Hullo, old man, how are you?”
FRIEND: “First-rate —and you?”
SQUATTER : “Well as can be expected.”
FRIEND: “And the station ?”
SQUATTER: “ Oh, that’s all right. The blanky bank’s got
the deeds, and the blanky rabbits have got the station.”

An elderly Southern musician, thinking
a certain young lady entertained a tender regard
for him, presented her with a piano costing £l5O.
Her mother fancied she was the object of his
affections, and put down the gift as a roundabout

however, when the daughter’s engagement to a
prominent athlete was announced, for the musician
wrote a polite note asking for the return of his

Before a recent big marriage down South
could eventuate, the bride’s mother (who holds the
cash) had to fork out .£looo—to propitiate a

If the “ notes ” taken by a certain divorce
Judge in one of the Australias were reproduced
and published by the Government of his province,
their ready sale would go far towards paying off
the deficit. They consist principally of amusing
and occasionally startling sketches illustrating the
most cerulean portions of the evidence.
The Law, with barristers and
attorneys practising at the Courts pre-
sided over by their near relations, is
not, seemingly, the only profession
where kissing goes by favour, or your
chances of success go according to the
nearness of your kinsmanship with the
high cockalorum. The architects (and
after lawyers come architects in their
many ways of “doing” you) have a
similar grievance. They declare it im-
possible for them to get their plans
passed by a certain Court in an Aus-
tralian city, because a very near rela-
tion of one with great power in this
connection is an architect.

It is extensively rumoured that
Willoughby Andrew, convicted some
three years ago of the murder of J.
H. Bartlett, draper, of King-street,
Sydney, and who had his death-
sentence commuted to life-imprison-
ment, has been released and exiled.
Whether this rumour is true or not it
is perfectly certain that, as a matter
of principle, every commutation or
alteration of any sentence passed by a
Court of Law should be announced,
together with a statement of reasons,
in the Government Gazette.

Brisbane (Q.) has given forth a Brig-

is alleged against him that he was married at the
age of 14 years, anil has three wives already, and he
is being summoned for the mainterihnee of three
children at present in a Government orphanage.
Henry George ought to be restored to expiation
in the bosoms of his families.

It is cabled that Queen Victoria and the
Princess of Wales refuse to join the Anti-Crinoline
League or to express any opinion upon the ques-
tion of reviving the fashion of wearing the crino-

no doubt meet with the hearty sympathy of all
right-minded ’bus and railway companies. Also,

“ Will the new Act stop baby-farming?”
asks a juryman of Coroner Youl, and his reply is ;
“ Will it stop babies ?” Which calls to mind Jack

N.S.W. Police Inspector-General Fosbery,
they say, will shortly retire on a pension. Which
recalls the fact that at high noon one day last
week a couple qf lusty fruit-hawkers fought six or
seven'savage rounds in the very heart of Sydney
—in George-street, between the Cafe Francais and
Elkington’s—in the presence of a few hundred
people, not one of whom interfered to spoil the
fun. No policeman appeared until several minutes
afterwards. Under such favourable conditions,
the mid-day fight will, no doubt (like pastor-bar-

a most popular institution.

JANUARY 20.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
This is the day we celebrate,
The day when Britain, good and great,
Whose name all “ loyal ” folks revere.
First shot her tainted offal here ;
When curses loud from lips unshorn
Proclaimed another nation born.
This is the day, the date sublime,
Recorded on the sands of crime ;
In fancy can we hear again
The clanking of the convict chain ;
To Hingiand are w r e bound, wethinks,
By—breathe it gently—iron links.
Though since the brave old times have fled
We call ’em “ silken bonds ” instead.
Throw up your hats, hang out your flags,
In honour of our early “ lags,”
Who by the Motherland were sent
To form a felon settlement;
Which settlement was made, and thus
We see what Hingiand did for us ;
So to the glory of her name
We’ll celebrate the day they came,
And be, as is but fit and right,
Ourselves transported with delight.
CAMERON—Janet Ann, native of Scotland, who died at
Kelpin Valley, January 13,1883.
Ten years to day since it was flashed to me;
“ Mother’s dead; she died at nine o’clock this day; her
last word was for you.”
Oh, why did I reel and my sight grow dim, as the past to
memory rushed;
I thought of the time and the money I wasted, when a
young and senseless fool.
For the smiles of a false and worthless woman who allured
me from my dear mother’s home ;
But mother’s words comes true: “Evil tricks, like
chickens, come home to roost.”
For the false one met a dreadful doom—Vengeance is the
Lord’s.
The loss of a mother dear has no telling till that dear one
is gone ;
Every hair of her head when she is missing is treasured
by a daughter or a son.
Ah ! boys who have a mother, do not cause her pain,
For you will be sorry for your blindness, but your sorrow
cannot bring her back again.
There is no one in this world like a mother ;
Keep her colours true, boys, and you never will rue.
Inserted by her sorrowing son, Roderick.
Roderick’s sorrow is mellifluously expressed, but
it is a mean thing for a man to slate his sweetheart
under cover of love for his mother.
“WHIP-POOR WILL.”- A PASSOVER HYMN.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
A mighty Judge of awful fame
And sternness most judicial.
Had earned Unenviable name
For sen ten tie sacrificial:
kach prisoner who before him cabin
He’d brand With stinging Words of flame,
And knock him flat
With dose of “ eat ”
A pastime sacrificial.
Of “time” and “hard” he’d quite a stock
Of “oat ” a hune consignment,
For those awaiting it “ in dock,”
With “ solit’ry confinement ” ;
These gifts were meant to strike with awe
The man who dared to break the law,
He’d have to “grin
And bear it” in
His solit’ry confinement.
Strong men were often “deeply stirred ”
And turned “as pale as ashes,”
And shook with terror when they heard,
“Ten years and sixty lashes ”
Jlis Honor, with a massive frown,
Would vow to put such laches down,
And so deter
Those prone to err,
With thrice a score of lashes.
He “ gave it hot ” for ev’ry crime,
For some lie gave it hotter—
For spruce embezzlers lengthy “ time,”
With “ cat ” for the garrotter ;
And e’en the very toughest pelt
The nine-tails in advance has felt,
And quivered then
in terror when
He “ dealt with ” the garrotter.
A fid when the Press was at its desk
And quite prepared to drivel,
With speech long, strong, and picturesque
He’d make his victims snivel;
But when the scribes had stayed away
He hadn’t half so much to say,
But out it short
And left the Court -
In gaol his prey would shrivel.
But one fine day that dreaded Judge,
Whose arm so long had towered,
Whom many owed a lifelong grudge,
Was proved a petty coward ;
Tne “Seat of Justice ” once, forsooth 1
“Conceit of Bluster” moved, in truth—
Men watched him squirm
A very worm,
A whining, petty coward.
The People, e’en the servile Press,
Laid on the stripes with vigour
Until lie writhed in sore distress,
A scarred. Unlovely figure
(A figure (bis of virile speech,
But what a moral it can teach !
When Sorrow’s cup
Is full, trice up
A Judge and flay ins figure).
And this one who had thought it “ f.,fc ”
To catch so many tripping
And flog them all, now “ whipt the cab”
And veiled beneath the whipping ;
And in his dreams, all undismayed,
A spectral horde whom he had flayed
Politely asked,
“Now you’re unmasked,
How do you like a whipping?”

A FRUITFUL SUBJECT.
[ FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Quoth she : “ What fruit do you like best?”
To Jack (on her, you bet, he dotes),
Ho drew her to his manly breast
And answered, “ ‘ Pluins ’—in petticoats ;"
Then while the damsel, coyly dumb,
Admired his latest fashion suit,
He bent his head to kiss the plum,
And caught a taste of passion-fruit.
“ You’ll never leave your ‘ plum ’ to pine?”
He smothered all her merry quips
(O ! pair green, gaged to love divine !)
Upon her pouting cherry lips.
None, applely, were there to peach
And talk of impropriety ;
The fruit abhorred by both and each
Was “gooseberry” society.

Some while ago, a foreign Hebrew im-
ported to Melbourne two of his nieces from

their own lingo, and when they would amble up
to the young fish - eaters, and in a voice laden
with the smell of pickled cucumbers, breathe soft
words of love into their ears, the old man would
have to statid by to translate. Courtship under
these circumstances was a failure, and the sons
called off the bargain ; when de fader, not liking

one himself, and is now looking about for a

The following, from a Sydney weekly,
within the last year or so (names and addresses
altered, as we merely wish to point a moral), is an
evidence of what the society-par business always
comes to sooner or later
Mr. and Mrs. T. Carbury, of Surrey House, Darling-
street, entertained a large party of friends on Thursday,
December 8, the occasion being the celebration of the
21st birthday of their third son, Mr. Reginald Carbury,
who is connected with the collecting branch of Melb.
General Post Office. Many lady and gentlemen friends
were present, and singing and dancing were freely
indulged in. Master and Miss Carbury’s hornpipe and
jig, Miss Higgins’ rendition of “Marguerite,” and several
solos on an English concertina by Mr. Johnson, formed a
very pleasant part of the evening’s entertainment. Mr.
Cohen presided at the piano. At dinner, the healths of
the host and hostess, also that of Mr. Reginald Carbury,
were duly honoured, the company dispersing at an early
hour.
The Bulletin doesn’t see any reason why a
shivoo in a boarding-house shouldn’t be chronicled
as well as a party in a beer-manufacturer’s man-
sion—the glaring thing about the show is the
anxiety of the people concerned to disguise
the fact that it is a boarding - house,
and to conceal the circumstance that the
young man “ connected with the collecting
branch, G.P.0.,” is simply the red-coated youth
who gallops round with a bag and takes the letters
out of the pillar-boxes. The poor, obtuse Jernil
probably doesn’t realise this, and won’t realise it
until somebody passes upon it a story about a
party held in the house of Mr. Smith, “who is
BLAZING.
COMMERCIAL TRAVELLER : “What the — do you call this? I said
Red Heart rum.”
GIRL: Well, ain’t it red hot?”
employed in the nocturnal collecting department
of the municipal service*” There is a lot of
smothered humour, too, in the “ solos on the
English—not the seven-and-sixpenny German-
concertina,” and the company “dispersed ” at an
early hour. Of coutse they did ; hadn't Mr. R.
Carbury to be round at 5 a.m. to perform his
duties in the collecting branch, and didn’t he
want to get to bed early in consequence? This
social item reminds us somehow of another story
about a man who was recently sacked from the
“nocturnal collecting department.” Someone
asked his superior officer the reason of his dis-
charge, and that gentleman explained : “Well,
you see, it’s just this—’e didn’t seem to takj no
pride in ’is work.”

The Swede, Larsen, who was before the
Coroner’s Court charged with the murder of
Connell in Sydney Domain (and against whom
there was no more evidence than there was against
Governor Jersey), has not “disappeared from
Sydney.” Larsen is still employed as a fruit-
hawker and may be se n and spoken to any day
near the intersection of King and Pitt-streets.
The Bar claims that 12 months legal amal-
gamation, in Melbourne, has made no difference.
How is this for logic 1 A man who had
held the position of watchman at a Brisbane rail-
way crossing for six years was discovered to be
unable to read or write, and was shifted to another
and less responsible billet. His successor im-
mediately received a threatening letter, and the
ex-watchman was promptly sacked on the official
assumption that “he was the only man who could
have written it.” There is room for a lot of
massive thinking just here.
A very, very old Maori is one of the curio-
sities of London. No one knows how he got
there, and he doesn’t seem to know himself. He
is bowed, wizened, tattered, tattooed and stone-
broke, and he wanders about sadly and lives on
charity. Now and then a returned Maorilander
sights him, and greets him with some scrap of
his beloved aboriginal tongue, and then the old
ruin, in his joy, embraces him and wants to rub
noses. But seemingly no “ kavvlinist ” ever offers
to stand the poor old aborigine a passage back to his
native hills, and he will probably die in an inhos-
pitable land and be buried where his ancient war-
gods will never find him at the resurrection.
In the country is the idea of home.
There you see the rising and setting sun; you
become acquainted with the stars and clouds.
The constellations are your friends. You hear
the rain on the roof, and listen to the rhythmic
sighing of the winds. You are thrilled by the
resurrection called Spring, touched and saddened
by autumn—the grace and poetry of death.
Every field is a picture, a landscape ; every land-
scape a poem ; every flower a tender thought, and
every forest a fairyland. In the country you
preserve your identity—your personality. There
you are an aggregation of atoms; but in the city
you are only an atom of an aggregation.— lnger-

Dr. Norman Kerr
says that some women
who habituate them-
selves to the use of
alcohol and narcotics can
take as much as eight
ounces of laudanum, or
three buttles of brandy,
in a day.
A Maoriland taber-
nacle was in low water
after the manner of
tabernacles in general,
and fell back on the old,
familiar bazaar to recruit
its shattered fortunes.
The bazaar was a great
success. There were the
usual airy maidens in
blue and white clothes
and pink complexions,
tiie wonted cake-and-
bun stall, the doll stall,
lucky - bag, raffle, and
wheel of fortune, and in
one corner a “ brother ”
had set up a galvanic
battery and gave shocks
at threepence each. By-
and-by a rich young
Maori came along a
Maori of the new genera-
tion with a college educa-
tion and a superfine suit
and a high hat, and all
tiie other fixings of civi-
lisation. He took his
threepenny shock and
remarked, with a plea-
sant smile : “ Thank
you, that’s quite suffi-
cient.” Nobody knows
exactly the cause of
what followed. One
theory is that the
“ brother ” in charge
made a mistake and
turned the handle the
wrong way, and another
is that he thought the
gorgeous native was an
individual who could be
made a fool of with im-
punity. Anyhow, in-
stead of the current
turning off, the Maori
found himself saluted
with a series of violent shocks, each one harder
than the last. He made an effort to tear
himself away, but failed. Then he addressed the
electrician three times in quick succession :
“That’ll do, thank you; thank yon, that’ll do;
that’ll do, thank you.” But just at this point he
got a harder shock than before, and suddenly all
his education and painfully-acquired polish slipped
away from beneath his feet, and he spoke at the
top of his voice in a mixture of Maori and English,
fo’oastle blasphemy, b illock driverese, whaler lan-
guage, and plain Billingsgate, and said : “
—— Sheol ! Hades
blanky !!! !!” And then a great silence
weighing nearly a ton fell on the religious assem-
blage which could plainly hear its hair growing.
The bazaar closed up prematurely.
In the race for the great prize of popularity
Wolfe’s .Schnapps takes the lead.
Holt-White figures in Forbes’ article on
War Correspondence as a fine art, in the new
Century. Forbes ranks him very high, and
mentions how White was present, near the German
Emperor, when the flag of truce, or surrender (a
napkin), came over from Sedan. White, grasping
this unique opportunity, and also the napkin,
bravely dashed over the battlefield for the Belgian
telegraphs, but nobody would believe him, or send
his message, and he went on to London, where he
wrote the first account in Pall Mall Gazette
office. Many years afterwards he came to Mel-
bourne and drew attention at once with his news-
paper articles on “Celebrities I Have Known.”
There was an actuality and vraisemblanee which
caught on, but he soon died, in the Alfred Hos-
pital. A strange and eccentric man. He was
No. 46 in the writers for Yates’ World. Yates

nated to the writer of every article or paragraph,
but they do not put their names on the marked
copy.
“Future generations, when they hava
separated the wheat from the chaff, will find, to
their astonishment, that the wheat of all religions
was the same, and that men were only quarrelling
■ about the chaff.”—Universalist Smith.
I Captain John Mackay, late black birder,
writes about Tucopia :—“No missionary has ever
, landed at this island, which, to me, is a source of
astonishment, offering, as it does, such an exten-
sive field for the manufacture of cocoanut-oil.’’
“ He who keenly feels the passionate joys
of earth will, sooner or later, be attracted by the
flavour of the fruits of heaven,” says Balzac’s
“ Country Doctor.” This just about explains the
affection of the sleek parson for the most fetching
girl in his choir.
Editor Bulletin. — lie your notice of Mr.
J. B. O’Hara’s “A Forest of the Dead.” The
word “warrigal” appears never to be used to
denote wild cattle. I have made many enquiries
from pastoral friends, who apply the word to wild
homes only. There is, as far as they know, no
word for wild cattle. — Kez.
Wolfe’s Schnapps has no injurious ingredients.
The Victorian Minister of Public Works,
receiving an unemployed deputation, the other
day, warned them of one Andrade—this in the
patronising “My men ” style, treating them as if
they were little boys. Our impression is that
Andrade talks both sense and nonsense. Any-
how, the workman is just as well able to dis-
criminate as any Minister of Works.
Wolfe’s Schnapps is the greatest tonic and
most beneficial stimulant of the day.
Bartomeo Pedrotta, gunsmith, Bathurst,
N.S.W., is dead. He fought under Garibaldi in
the Italian War of Independence ; afterwards he
settled in Bathurst. When Hall’s gang visited
that town, Ben had three objects in view : to
prove that the police were duffers, which he did ;
to possess himself of the celebrated racing mare
belonging to “Dublin Jack,” who kept a pub. in
Fiper-street, which he didn’t, as Jack Declouet
kept the key of the stable in his pocket and defied
the ’ranger ; and to make a raid upon Pedrotta’s
gunshop for arms, &c., in which he was highly
successful. The best shots in the West were
coached by “ Old Ped,”
We have received a copy of the Modern
Review, a new British publication which evidently
intends to boom. It is built on the familiar lines
of the Prophet Stead, only more so—much more
so. The publishers have distinctly realised that
the two paying things in modern literature are
dirt and snuffle mixed, and they have gone in for
dirt and snuffle accordingly. They differ from
Stead principally in the fact that there is more
dirt and less snuffle than that red-headed crank’s
average. The Modern Review is a publication
of the Social Gimlet Society order, and its object
is to do Good in trie unctuous, bald-headed, slimy
fashion which prevades the modern Purity Brigade
in general, and which only differs from ordinary
plain wickedness inasmuch as it is accompanied
by an inflamed eye and a noble motive. Some of
the articles are plain indecency set forth in much
oily detail and with a groan of horror that such
things should be, and the rest are mostly about
cancer, seduction, deceased wives’ sisters, the
superfluousness of marriage, and similar cheerful
subjects. There are two illustrations, both
of parsons. They are appropriately
inserted in the article, entitled, “The Sin of Our
Cities”; one parson looks as if he were sternly
resolved to brazen it out, and, if necessary,
hire someone to swear an alibi on his behalf, and
the other parson looks thick-lipped, bland, and
greasy, like the sort of shepherd who goes down into
the kitchen and embraces the cook. A publica-
tion like thn Modern Review almost always
comes out strongly with portraits of parsons—in
fact it is the only kind of magazine that does so.
When you open a review and find the pastor’s
photo, looming up conspicuously it is safe to
wager that it is a publication of the biblical ash-
heap variety. The New Review lias the cus-
tomary British craving after titled contributors,
and it has scooped in three, Lady Florence Dixie
—well-known as a hysterical crank who tells
strange stories about attacks made upon her by
Fenians and wild dogs—and Sir Francis and Lady
Cook—whoever they may be. Lady Cook writes
the article on “Seduction,” and writes it with a
vigour that ought to make her husband sit up, but
even her most energetic statements are full of an
ineffable dreariness. In fact, all the writers are
more or less dreary, and even their attempts at
offensiveness are mostly sad and depressing. The
brightest slab in the present issue is probably the
following tough statement by the irrepressible
Florence Dixie :
Look at Women in the political world. Why, save as a
maid-of-all-work, to scrub and scour for the men, she is
naught. She is a pariah, outside the pale of human
rights. She may not even vote for the male who is to
represent her, unless she does so by stealth and fraud; for
it will surprise some people to know that there are not a
few \oters in the United Kingdom who are women in
men’s clothes, who have been forced to adopt that attire
in oidi r to obtain work, and who, posing as men, exercise
those rivhts which are denied to them as women. I
myself know several of these people, and am willing
to confess that I have advised and helped them to
play their role. It is man s shame that women
should bo driven to such a subterfuge to obtain
liberty, protection, employment, and the common-
est of human rights, the vote. I, for one, shall
always advise women to act thus when it is convenient
to themselves to do so, and where their position makes it
necessary. At this moment I know a woman who is
captain of a ship, her sex being unknown to her
employers, who regard her as a most valuable servant •
while I am acquainted with two women pilots who
carry on their calling with skill and efficiency. These
facts prove strongly that women and men should not he
tied down to any special duties or lines in life. They
should do that for which they feel most fitted irrespec-
tive of sex. 1
After that, Florence Dixie drops to the same level
as the rest, and tiie atmosphere of bones and
cancerous tissue and general undress and diseased
piety remains unbroken to the end. The name of
the editor isn’t given, but The Bulletin hereby
makes a small bet that the Modern Review is
run by a wild-eyed opium-eater.
Dyspepsia, flatulence, sour stomach, wind,
and spasms are frequently due to liver complaint,
very often complicated by kidney sympathy, &c.
Brain and those persons whose employ-
ment is of a sedentary nature are most troubled
by these complaints. An eminent physician, who
made such cases a special study, found that the
ingredients of Dr. Fletcher’s Pills were the most
successful for such complaints, and embodied
them in the prescription from which these pills
are prepared. They are prepared on scientific
principles, are absolutely free from calomel or any
dangerous drug. They act by generous stimu-
lation of the hiepatic glands, and do not gripe or
purge, but produce a natural catharsis, and thus
relieve the overloaded alvine tract of the accu-
mulated fgecal matter without the pain and
annoyance so frequently experienced after using
drastic purgatives. Mrs. W. Walker, Pitt street
Sydney, says :—“ Dr. Fletcher’s Pills cured me of
chronic constipation of ten years’ standing, and I
can conscientiously recommend them.” They are
sold everywhere by chemists and storekeepers.

Some seven years ago a strange thing happened to the lady
whose photo, appeals herewith, whereby she became
A. MYSTERY
Which no one can explain or account for so far, not even her
husband. How it happened was this : She lay dying of a compli-
cation of diseases ; often she would faint off, and lie unconscious
as long as 30 hours at a stretch— frigid as a corpse and apparently
dead. The leading medical men of Melbourne were in attendance,
often at a cost of Five Guineas a day, yet she sank lower and
lower. Everything that medical science could suggest was tried ;
even morphia failed to give enough ease for two hours’ sleep
daily. At last, in desperation, some said, “ Try Mesmerism.”
Mr. Harle, as a Mesmerist,
Had been very successful on the public platform, and had also
saved life by private magnetic treatment; but Mrs. Harle, being
a lady of very pronounced opinions and strong mind of her own,
never could see anything in it but a hobby of bis, and so, when
urged to try it, she ridiculed the very idea ; but they said, “ Try
it for sleep only— you will go mad for want of rest.” For a long
time she could not bring her mind to submit; at last, aft« rmuch
prayer to God for guidance and help, she was willing to try.
After about half an hour’s mesmeric influence and passes, she
went off into a peaceful hypnotic state, which lasted, as was
intended, from eight at night till ten next morning ; and she
awoke rested and refreshed. The experiment was repeated, when
m
Lo! Everyone was Startled Mrs. .t. n. HARLE.
To find that, whilst to all intents and purposes she was asleep, yet in another sense, the mind was far more awake,
and she commenced talking about what the servant was doing on the ground floor, what an acquaintance was doing a
anile away, what was happening in the home of a dear friend some few blocks away, and so forth. Then she was
requested to look into her own body ; this she did, and was surprised herself, and surprised everyone else, by tracing
;lhe cause of her trouble, which proved to be mainly an internal cancer. She then told them how to cure her. °
Crowds of Friends Came to See Her,
■For she had a large and influential circle of acquaintances. She astounded all by her marvellous powers of vision—
to see into their bodies as if they were made of transparent glass, to see the members of their families, to know all
about their commercial affairs, seemed quite easy to her ; England, America, New Zealand, etc., seemed just like next
• door.
The Sensation was Immense!
• Drawing-room, Sitting-room, Dining-room and Bedroom were crowded with inquisitive people, and the invalid became
a phenomenon. The doctors were nonplussed with their patient-she gave directions how lo soften the cancer to the
lancing slate: this was done ; then, ns they dare not give chloroform on account other heart, Mr. Harle put her under
mesmerism, whilst Dra. Teague, of Collins Street, lanced it. She awoke without having felt anything that had hap-
pened. Everyone said : “ Start and use your powers for doing good, you can
Save Lives by Thousands.”
But her health was too low. First, she cured herself—in three months’time she was again taking her accustomed
drives on the Esplanade, in her phaiton, to the astonishment of the whole district. To properly tone the system a
change of climate was needed, and she came to N.S. Wales. For a short time she resided in Maitland; her retreat
was known by those who were aware of her powers, and she got no peace till she agreed to start practice. Five years
ago Mrs Haile opened in Newcastle ; three years out of the five have been spent travelling in the Northern district,
and away in the bush discovering gold mines, and she seems to be able to find gold as easy as trace disease.
Seven Thousand People Have Consulted Her
'ln her mesmeric state ; come about business, but most about their health. Not one can say :“I am worse for your
treatment,” whilst all who have followed the advice and treatment, rejoice in restored health. Mrs. Harle describes
each diseased organ, finds the cause of every (rouble, and prescribes remedies and treatment. Her wonderful mental
vision or clear sight enables her to see just what medicine, and how long it will take to cure it, often giving the
medicine threemonths ahead, and never changing a bottle.
Warning!
■lf you wish to mortally offend Mrs. Harle, just class her along with the card-reading, palm-scanning, fortune-telling
crowd, and the task is done. No such rubbish ! Mrs. Harle is mesmerised by her husband, and when in the hypnotic
state, she sees with her mind. She cannot open her eyes, yet she hears, talks, asks and answers questions, etc." When
the mesmerism is undone, she awakes, and knows no more of what has happened, than if she had been chloroformed
or dead.
It Causes a Terrible Mental Strain,
Therefore, Mr. Harle reserves the right to say when she has done enough, and may refuse any or all at such times.
The Fee is half-a-guinea for bodily examination, and a guinea for business advice. The half-guinea includes a
complete tracing of your case, and a full statement of how to cure you. Businessmen have voluntarily paid as high as
£5, and even £l5, for the arrangement of a business tangle. She guarantees in all cases a full value in the treatment,
and more satisfaction all round than can possibly be obtained by any other means whatever. Special medicine is
prepared for each case treated. Mrs. Harle is prepared to work with the family physician or any qualified medical
man, if her suggestions are carried out. She is prepared to treat any case that can be cured, but insists upon only
using her Eclectic Botanic Hemedies-she has no faith in mineral medicines. It is desirable to make appointments or
come early in the day, whilst her brain power is fresh. Outdoor visits must also he arranged.
Simple cases send £1; Complicated Cases send £s—with age, sex, occupation, all symptoms, particularly state of
•bowels, how long suffering, and a Photo, if you have one (we will return it) and you' will receive post or rail free a
course of Mrs. Harle’s latest marvellous remedies and her personal care of your case—with full advice on diet and
exercise, &c.
P.S.—Mrs. Harle’s chief reason for visiting Sydney for some six months is to introduce her Remedies to the
Public, and open a Dispensary where people may call and see her or write for the Remedies or call for them.

NURSE’S REPORT.
Medical men say that a good nurse in a diffi-
cult case is better than medicine, but when we
can get a good nurse and good medicine, the
patient stands a much better chance of recovery.
The few words of advice given below by nurse
Eliza King, of Great Massingham, S waff ham, are
well worthy the attention of all readers of this
paper. They are as follows : “ I have constantly
used St. Jacobs Oil in the various situations I
have occupied as nurse, and have invariably found
it excellent in all cases requiring outward applica-
tions, such as sprains, bruises, rheumatic affec-
tions, neuralgia, &c. In cases of pleurisy it is an
excellent remedy-—well rubbed in." I can strongly
recommend it, after several years’ use and ex-
perience. It should be in every household.”
Sister Carolina, St. Andrew’s Hospital, Clewer,
Windsor, writes: “ I take this opportunity of
stating that I have found St. Jacobs Oil a most
efficacious remedy in gout; also in sprains and
bruises. Indeed, we cannot say too much in its
praise, and our doctor is ordering it constantly.”
Henry and Ann Bright, hon. superintendents
of the North London Home for Aged Christian
Blind Women, says that a remedy has proved
itself unfailing: that rheumatism and neuralgia
have, in every case, been removed by St. Jacobs
Oil—the remedy referred to—and that many old
ladies, some of them 90 years old, instead of toss-
ing about in agony, now enjoy a good night’s rest
through its influence. Mrs. Bright says she can-
not say enough in its favour.
Six gold medals have been awarded to St.
Jacobs Oil for its marvellous power to relieve and
cure pain. It acts like magic. It cures when
everything else has failed. It has cured people
who have been lame and crippled with pain over
20 years. It cures rheumatism, neuralgia, face-
ache, backache, sprains, and other bodily pains.
It is an external remedy. It penetrates to the
seat of the disease. It is simple, safe, and sure.

(AUSTRALIA HOTEL), A CALL.
Editor Bulletin, — Re your recent articles
on prisoners- awaiting trial in Sydney; the treat-
ment accorded such is much the same in Victoria.
The remanded or committed prisoner—-I myself
have been a remanded prisoner—is taken to Mel-
bourne Gaul in Black Maria (V.K.) where he strips
and l.as his clothes carefully searched by a con-
victed man in the presence of a warder who stands
by to see that everything, even to sleeve-links,
studs and pocket-handlce; chief, is removed from
them. Then he is put into a cold bath, and
bundled off to a cell with six others. In this cell
ho spends the hours from 3 p.m. to 6.30 a.m.
On rising in the morning he is marched into a
“yard ” of triangular shape, 30 feet deep with a
12-foot base, where he and from three to a dozen
others wash themselves in a small tub of water ;
all use the same water and the same towel! Here
he spends the day. The “Committed” man is
allowed one trashy “religions” book a week—
Sunday at Home, Welcome, Sunday Magazine,
—but the “remand” man is not supposed
to require such mental refreshment. He
must toe a line in the said yard and
salute the Governor, the Deputy-do., the chief
warder, the chaplain, any visiting magistrate,
and if he does not do this he gets 24 hours
solitary. After being, probably, accustomed to
good, if not luxurious, food outside, he is put at
once on hominy and six ounces of cooked meat —
cut up for him—and eight ounces of potatoes,
often bad—an even lower diet than the convicted
prisoners get. He may have his food sent in,
providing he or his friends pay for it, and have it
sent in proper dishes to the gaol gate, and provided
also he has it sent in from the very first; but if
he eat so much as one single dish of hominy, it’s
hominy thenceforward till he is free again. And
if his friends send him in anything “ tasty,” the
warder on the gate, and the ditto on the remand-
yard, and the ditto on the corridor, and the
prisoner who carries the dishes along, all “search”
the food for contraband articles, and by the time
the unfortunate “remanded ” gets it he probably
wishes he’d taken the hominy. Very often one
of the warders is busy, in which case ho
doesn’t get his food at all. The writer j
has known of a man going two days
without food, save such as his fellow-remands
could spare him, and complaints only elicited pro-
mises to “ see about it.” He knows one man who,
under remand for a long time, was in the habit of
receiving a slice of cake every Sunday with his
tea (sent in). One Sunday there were the cake-
crumbs, but no cake. He complained next morn-
ing to the chief warder ; C. W. reported to deputy-
governor ; warder in charge of corridor examined,
denied receiving cake; warder on gate ditto;
result, groundless complaint; 24 hours’ solitary.
And solitary in Melbourne Gaol means 24 hours
in a cell 6 feet by 3 feet by 8 feet high, with only a
damaged Sunday at Home and a piece of bread
the size of your fist for 24 hours, or, possibly, two
or three days. (It takes a visiting magistrate to
award more than three days.) Also, owing to the
thickness of the walls, the narrowness of the
‘ window,’ and the position of the wings, the cell
is nearly always too dark to see to r id. Further-
more, prisoners, convicted or not, in solitary are not
allowed even to pick oakum ; they are supposed
to meditate on the beauty and cheerfulness of
idleness, and the folly of not submitting to every
Jack-in-office who wears a uniform. Thus, while
the prosecutor has the benefit of the newspapers
and everything the outside world can give to
assist him, the accused (who, mind you, is leerally
‘ supposed” to be innocent) is kept literally in
the dark by every possible means. Should the
prisoner wear a moustache only, his whole hair is
allowed to grow during remand or committal, and
on the morning of his re-appearance in court this
week or fortnight’s growth is carefully scraped off
by the gaol barber, a prisoner of course. A
daily shave is a luxury the law does not
allow to innocent men. He can only see his
friends on certain days and on certain hours, in
the presence of a warder, and he can only write
when the chief - warder, through the deputy,
through the governor, thinks fit, and, of course,
his letters are read by all. Also, after the first
bath on entering, tho’ he remain on remand for
months, he is not supposed to need another. He
doesn’t get it until he has asked for it a dozen
times, and then probably in loathsome water
which has already been used by others.— Frank.
T. H. Cowl, for many years telegraph-
manager at Brisbane, (Q.), is being battledored up
North again. In the earliest days of “Gulf”
telegraphy, Cowl put in 3| years at Normanton,
when two-steamers-a-year was its sole connection
with the vanities of civilisation, and sun-cured
beef was the staple diet of the district. A subse-
quent period of 9J years at Cooktown was quite
lively in comparison, and Brisbane became a
Paradise. Now the old man is being kicked back
into the tropics.
Melbourne papers last week had a heavy
headline, “ Dreadful outrage by Chinese pirates ;
1400 people killed, and a village burnt.” How
different in Burrnah or India : “ Attack on a town.
Victory of the British ; 2000 of the enemy killed ;
one officer and three men slightly wounded on the
British side. The town fired.”
The clergy, of course, largely helped to
boom the Panama Canal swindle. The Papal
Treasurer got lOOfr. for commission on every
500 fr. worth of stock he bought, and, when he got
suspicious, another divine received 12,000 fr. for
inducing him to keep on buying. Sixty-four of
the weekly religious papers in France received
500 fr. a year each for publishing and booming
articles written by the company’s paid agents, and
as every cure who got his flock to buy stock
received a fat commission, a special secretary was
provided to settle things with them. Of such is
the Kingdom of Heaven.

SPORTING NOTIONS.
The cahleman announces that a Mr. Kerr and a
Mr. M'Guire, of England, are en route for this country,
with the intention of bicycling from Melbourne to Port
Darwin and hack. Probably the two individuals are guile-
less new chums who are under the impression that there
is a macadamised road between the two places ; but if not,
if they are aware of the nature of the country that they
will have to pass over, and are successful in their under-
taking', they will supply the answer to a question that old
bushmen often ask; Why should not bicycles be more
used in the bush? Of course they would he only suitable
for certain classes of roads and country, but as they
neither eat nor drink nor get lost, they would be far
superior to any of the other modes of transit now in use
during the dry season of the year.

A little yarn of a former Australian Eleven.
They were in an English provincial town, and two of the
team, and Charley Turner, sallied forth together
to the theatre. Next to them sat a gentleman and a lady.
The former eyed for a long time and then said, “I
b?gyour pardon, sir; are you Mr. Jenkinson?” “No,”
was the reply, “ I’m ——, of tie Australian Eleven.”
“Oh!” slid the stranger with all due vvondei m mt, and
they began to talk cricket. “Yes,” said , “one
does get some hard knocks sometimes. Look here ! ” and
pulling up his trousers to the km e he exhibited a nasty
bump to the stranger’s astounded gaze. The lady, too,
threw a few covert glances at the massive limb, in spite of
her ill-suppressed dismay. “By Jove!” said the
stranger: “Yes, but feel it,” was the kind invitation.
The stranger felt it, and considered that it was a very
hard bump indeed, thanks. But was not yet
satisfied. He was in a generous mood, as usual, “You
feel it, too, lady ; just see what we get at cricket, some-
times.” The lady reached over a dainty, gloved hand,
and touched the bump with the tip of her finger. ,
watching her face for any traces of hero-worship, noticed
her make a horrible grimace and lift her hand to her nose.
“ Ah ! ” said , proudly, “ you’re all right, ma’am ;
that’s eucalyptus ; we cure everything with it in dear old
Horsetralia ; I’ve got lots of it on me.” Then the band
began to play.
* # #
It is said that one name omitted from the Aus-
tralian Eleven was left out at its owner’s request, as it
will he unhealthy for him to visit England for some
time.
# * #
Strange that no one has yet recognised that the
boxing of a “trained kangaroo” is simply a very slight
development of his natural method of fighting. Two
“old men” will feint and parry before they clinch and
roll on the ground. Nor do they attempt to use their
hind-legs until they are down, wrestling. Sometimes
they will spar for many minutes before they get a hold.
If you watch a kangaroo with dogs you will see that using
his forepaws is no novel work to him.
# # *
The meeting between Slavin and Goddard
should prove short anti blood-letting. Both men are
sloggers, pure and simple, and although on paper it looks
odds on Slavin, there is no knowing what may happen to
the man who “goes in ”, to fight Joseph Goddard, and
does not finish him right out of hand. And where is the
man who could reckon surely on finishing Joseph Goddard
out of hand ?
* # *
When London Hawk says that it “doubts
whether Goddard would have the temerity to meet a man
of Slavin’s class,” it merely illustrates its ignorance.
Goddard would have “temerity” enough to fight a loco-
motive.

Pugilist Corbett is a real showman. He has
formed a syndicate to run a big boxing booth at Chicago
Show. The theatre will cost £20,000. He expects to
make a pile by providing fistic entertainments for all the
world and its wife.
# # #
Bonnor has been exhibiting such good form up-
country that ins inclusion in the N.S.VV. interprovincial
team lias been hailed with delight amongst cricketers. If
the giant shows up well in the match, it is on the cards
he may take a place with the English team. Outside the
fact that Bonnor, as a showman, is worth many dollars to
any team, he is worth many runs if in anything like form.
# * m‘
It is seldom the picking of a team gives such
general satisfaction as is the case with the N.S.VV. eleven
for the interprovincial match—commencing on this
Thursday.

Victoria howls for Dr. Jack Barrett in place of
Walter Giflen, but Callaway is an infinitely superior all-
round man. Parochialism prompts 99 per cent, of this
cricket “discussion.” Barrett goes to England on his
own account, in any case, and may play.
* # *
George Giffen and Lyons have a high opinion of
young Graham. Lyons predicts that the South Mel-
bournite will not be below fourth place in the Australian
Eleven averages. It was through Bruce’s persistency
that he was selected.
• * #
George Giffen is a champion without doubt. In
a match against the Adelaide Club, on Saturday, he
bowled all ten wickets, and going first to the wickets
played a not out innings for 172.
# # #
Editor Bulletin,—This must be said for Walter
Giffen—he has an average of 42 in big matches. The
Englishmen got S.A. out for 92 last year—Walter Giffen
45, not out. The writer, who lias seen Walter bat for
years, considers him a second edition of George.—G.T.
* # *
Melbourne Sportsman doesn’t ask for much.
Victoria already has six representatives in the Australian
Eleven, but the Sportsman wants to see Lewis substituted
for Jarvis, and Barrett for W. Giflen. Lewis is not within
a street of Jarvis either as a wicketkeeper or a batsman
* * #
George Giffen told a Register reporter: “I
have never made any stimulation that if Walter was not
chosen I would not go. ”
* * *
Of all Victorian criticisms on the Australian
Eleven the stupidest is the complaint that Alec. Banner-
man is “one of the have beens.” A year ago they were
blessing the little stouewaller for having won—yes,
‘‘ won ” was the word—the two matches against Lord
Sheffield’s lot. He must have grown old very rapidly.
# # #
Victor Cohen says “ George Giffen brought no
influence to bear as regards his brother, and Waller
Giffen was unanimously selected on his cricketing merits
by the Selection Committee.” It may readily lie ad-
mitted that it is better to send Walter Giffen than chance
losing George, but the writer is pretty safe in believing
that Bannermau and Blackham are the only two
cricketers outside South Australia who would pick Walter
Giffen before Donnan, Iredale, or Callaway.

Robison, of Sydney University, playing against
Melbourne last week, hit Dan. M‘Leod, brother of R. 11.,
and crack bowler of the home team, for four 4’s and 2 in
the first over of Sydney’s second innings. No harder
hitting has been seen on the M.O.C. ground than his
innings of 47.

Fighter Corbett : “ I’m not like other pugilists.
I’m a gentleman, and have always been one. I can’t be
anything else, and I will always be One. It’s in my
nature.” A gentleman, it is plain, needn’t necessarily be
modest.
* * *
In a Melbourne junior cricket bompetition, the
captain of one of the teams has an average of 141 for
eight innings. He has scored 282 runs, and was 6 times
not out. His last score was 85 (not out). Strong for a
junior.

Church dignitaries and titled personages are
playing up badly in Rockhampton (Q.). Says a local morn-
ing paper : “The Bishop ran to the front and raced along
to the home turn side by side with Ladykiller. As they'
swept round the bend the Bishop caught Miss Ever, but
was collared in the straight by the Baron. Manners
was nowhere.”
* # #
The Ciffen brothers number seven, and only four
more players would be needed.
* * *
J-f Malvolio, fit and well, can’t get into the first
three for the Australian Cup, his win in his Melbourne
'-' ll P v ' as surely the biggest accident on record. Oamoola
and Autonomy are “dead-birds” respectively, and at
least 20 other horses have “claims inferior to none.” But
at present the safest bet to make about any horse for the
Australian Cup is an even sixpence that he won’t start.
* * #
Projectile is the latest “likely ” for the Derby.
Directly a two-year-old runs prominently the tipsters
write him up.” In turn nearly every horse gets his
par., but the winner only has his dragged up again after
the race.
* # «
The fact of St. Hippo’s owner allowing the
horse to be barred from the betting of the Great Northern
Derby (M.L.) is held up, by some sporting writers, as
proof of the evils of the totalisator. In Sydney, under
the conditions of such a certainty, an owner would pro-
bably run the horse stiff after allowing the public to lay
4 to 1 on.
A- Sydney attorney, acting for a creditor,
lately wrote a journalistic debtor threatening
legal proceedings for debt. The poor newspaper
man replied sending a packet which he described
as his only asset. It contained a handful of dead
flies from a mouldy fly-paper.
One day Lady Loch visited the Victorian
Full Court, where Higinbotham was pre-
siding. Justice Kerferd drew attention to her
presence, and no doubt expected that the Chief
would suspend the proceedings or offer her a seat
on the Bench. But Higinbotham took no more
notice of the lady than he would have done
of Mrs. Bridget Moriarty.
Senior judge Williams* of Victoria, prided
himself upon having been born in Brunswick"
street, Collingwood, in a wooden, two-roomed
house. Old Dean Macartney says that
wood was then a fashionable place. One night,
years ago, at the Yorick Club, the late Judge
Cope asked a crowd of men to guess where he had
gone to live. Some said “ Toorak,” others “South
Yarra,’ more “St. Kilda.” “All wrong,” said
the Judge; “ I’m living in Collingwood.”
The announcement of Lord Jersey’s resig-
nation of the N.S. W. Governorship did not sur-
prise anybody who has watched the rapid zigzag-
mgs of his vice-regal household. As has often
been pointed out in these columns, the feverish
haste displayed by Lady Jersey to make herself
acquainted with the show-spots of Australia and
the South Seas indicated that she, at any rate, had
no fixed intention to “finish the term.” The
Bulletin, though eagerly looking forward to the
time when Republican Australia will elect its own
untitled Governor, is constrained to say that Lord
and Lady Jersey have made themselves eminently
popular here among all who are able to admire
sincerity and personal worth.
Dear Bulletin, —I have been told, as a fac fc
typical of human nature, that sly-grog distillers
are almost always teetotallers. I suppose that
this is a trait parallel to that of the publican who
drinks a solution of burnt sugar whenever asked
to “ join.” The “ publican’s bottle ” is usually a
spiritless snare. Nevertheless, there are excep-
tions. One very well-known Sydney boniface
lately said that, determining to find out'how many
drinks he did take in a day, he counted 91 uptilla
quarter to four, and then lost his reckoning.
Another publican, a fat man (“ a foreigner ”), who
has never been known to refuse a drink, declares
that he frequently takes 120 “nips” in the day
and yet is never drunk.—D.
Poor Tom Price—“ the Prince of Wales ”
Harold Grey used to call him, on account of his
strong resemblance facially and in some other
respects to Albert Edward in the latter’s younger
days—died in Sydney Hospital on Sunday night,
aged about 35. Although not so very long ago he
was the “swell” reporter of the S.M. Herald,
the pet of the office, and the white-haired boy of
the managing proprietor, the Herald was mean
enough to record the ex-favourite’s melancholy
death in a very bald and pretty brutal paragraph,
which completely ignored all mention of his former
connection with the paper. Price, fresh from
his native Ballarat, joined the Herald in 79,
and being a handsome and very presentable young
fellow, with strong artistic tastes and plenty of
brains and push, speedily became the Herald’s
representative at all “social” engagements,
besides being entrusted with its musical and
dramatic work. His manner of life ultimately
led to ill-health ; and he and the Herald parted
company. Whereupon he went up North, and
for several years was attached to the press of
Rocktfampton and Brisbane. Returning the other
day to Sydney, he was provided with a small post
by an old friend, but ere he had time to turn him-
self round he fainted and fell heavily in Hunter-
street, and died shortly after his admission to the
hospital. His funeral was attended by a few
press friends.
“IT FEARS NEITHER ARMY NOR
NAVY.”
Those things used to be called the wooden walls
of England.
The scene was the NaVal Exhibition at Chelseai
in the Brimmer of 1891. The speaker was A young
man, and his auditor one of those lithe,
haired girls one so often sees in this island.
“ And aren’t they the wooden walls of England,
now ?” she said, as a child might ask when Noah
might be expected in Liverpool with his ark.
‘‘Not exactly,” replied her escort, tenderly;
kt they are rather out of style. Come ; I’ll show
what sorts of walls we have now,” and he led her
off in the direction of the beautiful models of the
great steel ships of war.
The young fellow was right in assuming that
this country had a big and powerful navy, but the
chances of war decrease with the preparations
made to meet it. Besides, the interests that
would be put to hazard grow constantly larger and
nations avoid fighting as long as possible.
This is a hopeful consideration, and if England
had nothing to be afraid of beyond the danger of
being attacked from abroad, we might sleep in
peace. But there is an enemy against which
neither army nor navy is of any avail. It defies
the gunboats in the Channel and the redcoats on
the shore, and kills more people than are ever
likely to fall in battle.
If' we could stop the ravages of this foe we
should soon be able to surprise our distant colonies
with the arrival among them of a splendid class of
our surplus population.
We allude, of course, to disease. Not to epi-
demics of cholera or influenza, but to diseases
which are at work year in and year out, in every
season, carrying off rich and poor alike. Unques-
tionably the worst of these is the one that attacks
the digestive system, the one from which springs
the majority of ailments, which go under various
names, as, for example, rheumatism, gout,
bronchitis, consumption, the several fevers, and
others which were formerly, erroneously, supposed
to have distinct characters, and to require distinct
treatment.
Now, however, the best medical authorities
recognise these ailments as symptoms and out-
growths of indigestion and dyspepsia, and treat
them accordingly. In illustration of what can be
done, we cite a single case. A man named
Edward Kelly, who resides at 27, St. Vincent
Street, London Road, Liverpool, having pre-
viously had perfect health, experienced a dull
pain in the right side, a bad taste in the mouth,
furred tongue, loss of appetite, discoloured skin,
unnatural langour and fatigue, and what he des-
cribes as a “ sinking feeling,” as though the sup-
porting power were exhausted beneath him.
This Was in 1887, and he bore it without obtain-
ing relief from the usual medical treatment until
April, 1890, when one day, when he was Working
in a bonded warehouse, he says, “ a dreadful pain
struck me in the back, and I had great trouble in
getting through my work. Getting worse,” he
Continues, “1 went to a doctor, who said it was
inflammation of the kidneys. He gave me
medicine and attended me off and on for six
hionths, but With no beneficial result. He said he
could not understand how I could keep on with
my work. Still, I did struggle on, though the
disease was wearing me out. From a strong, able
man, I became thin and weak, and was afraid I
should have to give up my work. Last July,
1890, a Custom House officer recommended me to
try an advertised preparation, entitled Mother
Sergei’s Syrup. I did so, and before I had
finished the first bottle the pain left my back, and
I began to digest my food and gain strength. By
continuing to use this remedy I ivas soon as well
as ever in my life. My master, seeing what the
Syrup had done for me, also took it for indiges-
tion, with so much benefit that now he always
keeps it by him. I have no interest whatever in
testifying thus, and only speak of the medicine as I
found it.”
Mr. Kelly evidently had a narrow escape from
Bright’s disease, a malady very common among
all classes in England, anc\ one of the surest and
most direct products of torpid liver, itself a
symptom of indigestion and dyspepsia. We
mention this case not to put money in anybody’s
pocket, but for the sake of the sufferers who need
help—no matter what it comes from.

solemnly and sincerely declare as follows :—•
Whereas, I suffered severely from a very troublesome
affection of the Nerves, which affected me so much that
I was quite unable to attend to my business. I tried several
Doctors and many Remedies, but all of no avail. Whereas,
I, as a last hope, obtained some of Herr Rassmussen’s
PURELY HERBAL “ UNIVERSAL ALT ALINE
PILLS,” which I hereby solemnly and sincerely declare
COMPLETELY CURED ME within a few weeks, and
although this is over five years ago, I have remained well ever

THE ALE ALINE PILLS also cured my wife, and I make
this solemn declaration, conscientiously believing the same to
be true.

Purify your Blood with Ayer’s Sarsa-
parilla, the most thoroughly reliable altera-
tive ever compounded. For scrofula, boils,
ulcers, sores, carbuncles, pimples, and all
disorders originating in vitiated blood, this
medicine is unsurpassed. As a tonic,
Ayer’s Sarsaparilla
assists the process of digestion, stimu-
lates the liver, strengthens the nerves, and
builds up the body when debilitated by fa-
tigue or illness. Many people waste money
by experimenting with compounds, the prin-
cipal recommendation of which would seem
to be their “ cheapness.” The most reliable
medicines are costly, and can be retailed at
moderate prices only when the manufactur-
ing chemist handles the raw materials in
large quantities. It is economy, therefore, to
Use Ayer’s Sarsaparilla, the valuable com-
ponents of which are imported, wholesale,
from the regions where these articles are
richest in medicinal properties.

HOW BABIES SUFFER
From Torturing
When their tender Skins are literally On Firk with Itching and
Burning Eczemas and other Itching, Scaly, and Blotchy Skin and
Scalp Diseases, none but mothers realize.
To know that a single application of the Cuticura Reme-
dies will, in the great majority of cases, afford instant and complete
relief, permit rest and sleep, and point
to a permanent and economical (because
so speedy) cure, and not to use them
without a moment’s delay, is to be guilty
of positive inhumanity. [No greater leg-
acy can be bestowed upon a child than
a skin without blemish and a body nour-
ished with pure blood.

To Messrs. Bosisto and Co., —
It is with pleasure that I write to state
my opinion of your Eucalyptus Oil. It is de-
cidedly better than any other similar oil which
can be obtained in this country.
It is a lighter, clearer and more ethereal oil
than any I have hitherto used, besides being free
from the heavy, nauseous odour characteristic of
others.
This is particularly noticeable when the oil is
sprayed into the throat.
It is very palatable when taken internally,
which places it above other preparations and con-
siderably enhances its value.

A CARD.
A Piece of Woman Nature.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
The “great English comique” had arrived
under engagement to the management of the
Southern Cross music-hall, and all the hands at
the Southern Cross were prepared to bow down
before him. All but one.
* * *
The great comique was an insufferably
vulgar beast. He was grossly fat and grossly
familiar, achieved his “successes” by, among
other means, howling unmusical and suggestive
ditties, and by encouraging the gallery to join in
his choruses. The smaller artists were ready to
bow down before the man who got the biggest
pay, and consequently he installed himself as a
sort of dressing-room god. The “artistes,”
womanlike, worshipped his successes —with one
exception. This exception was Sophy Brown,
described on the bills as Ethel Drummond. She
lived in one of the near suburbs, was respectable
above the breath of scandal, and kept her mother
and younger sister decently on her earnings. Her
father kept himself. He had long deserted the
family.
This girl was naturally a lady—birth, environ-
ment, example—nothing could destroy her refine-
ment. And therefore the great English comique
disgusted her. She openly told her dressing-room
mates her contempt for the great man, and
wondered audibly at the homage they paid him.
And, what is more to the point, she took care
to let the star know of the contempt he excited.
She never spoke to him—he was to her as unin-
teresting in the way of an acquaintance as would
have been the mouldered mummy of a Pharaoh.
Several of the English comique’s co-beasts chaffed
him on the and, said he one night after the
show, “By , I’ll bring her down a peg or two,
I promise yer. ”
* * *
The great English comique had been howl-
ing to the gallery of the music-hall for nearly a
year, and he was grosser and coarser and more
brutal even than at the time of his importation.
Sophy Brown, or Ethel Drummond, according
to the bills, was quite as ladylike and quite as
modest-looking as she had been a year before.
She had grown paler and looked somewhat older,
that was all. Furthermore, there had occurred a
decided change In her manner towards the
cockney star. Previously she had merely despised
him —now she showed only, too plainly that she
hated him with a bitter, melodramatic'hate.
* * #
A fortnight later the English comique left
Australia for the cockney public that had mourned
his absence.
* * *
A good many weeks elapse.
Scene ; The Australian music-hall managerial
office. Said the manager to the individual who
acted as clerk, press-agent, treasurer, and half-a-
dozen other offioials. “You’d better see little
Drummond as soon as you can. She’s now been
away from us for months, and I don’t hear of her
singing anywhere. She’s a smart little woman,
and a sure draw—we’d better have her back at
once.
“Why, ’ said the various official, amazedly,
“ haven’t you heard?”
“Heard! What?”
“Why, she won’t be able to come here for a
long time yet.” And then, slyly, “ It’s a boy.”
“ Good ! And we always looked on little
Drummond as the pink of propriety. Who’s the
father ?”
“Well, one of the girls tells me it was Mont-
gomery Shand. ”
Montgomery Shand is the name of the great
English comique.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Moonlight and silence and sleep lay like a spell
Upon the city, giving it a look of hallovyed calm
such as death brings to the most sordid faces.
It was in the very early morning some weeks
back, and M’Ginnis and I had just started to
walk to our homes in a distant suburb.
Wo had parted a few minutes before from some
brother-Bohemians, who had marched off in dif-
ferent directions to their various destinations,
Jack Brewster, the patriarch and prince of them
all, cheerily trolling Murger’s song :
Oomme un enfant de BohCuie
M archant toujours au hasard,
Ami, je marcbe de nieme
Sur le grand chemin de I’art.
Et pour baton de voyage
Comme le Boh6mien,
J’ai I’espoir et le courage:
Sans cela je n’aurais rien.
“Sanscelajen’aurais rien,” hummed M’Ginnis,
as we passed down Swanston-street in the direc-
tion of Prince’s Bridge.
“It is a pleasure to walk about Melbourne at
night,” he said. “ It’s over a year now since I
have walked down a main street in the day-time.”
M’Ginnis was the most Dick Swivellerish of us
all—he had creditors thirsting for his blood in
every leading thoroughfare—and never used to
make his appearance in the city until after dark.
As we came abreast of the Fishmarket we met
a man carrying a swag. He was a tall, thin,
straight, and somewhat distinguished-looking
fellow, apparently about 35 or 40 years of age, and
gave both of us the impression of having been at
one time a cavalry officer in a crack regiment.
“ Good night, mate,” said M’Ginnis, who was
always on the look-out for curious characters, and
who had a taste for nocturnal adventures which
would have procured for him a Grand Viziership
in the days of Harouu A 1 Raschid.
For answer the man threw his swag down on
the pavement, after the fashion of a sundowner
when he meets other sundowners on a bush-road,
and drew out of his waistcoat-pocket a very black
clay pipe which he proceeded to fill with very
black and rank (as we discovered after he had
begun to smoke it) tobacco—still without saying a
word.
“ This is either a mad shepherd from the back :
blocks, or ri valuable humorist,” remarked
M’Ginnis iri a whispet.
“ I haven’t nly card-case with nie at present,”
said the swagman, “ but my name is Bill Bagot.
I’Ve been up-country for a year, arid I’Ve come
down to Melbourne to get my barik-draft cashed;
I’m going round to the barik iri the. morning to see
tile manager and—well, he knows Bill Bagot won’t
stand any df his inferrial counter-jlimping non-
sense. ”
As he concluded his Statement Mr. Bagot cut a
graceful pigeon-wing, and pirouetted across the
paVemerit.
Then I recollected a paragraph I had seen in the
daily papers 12 months previously about the same
Bill Bagot.
The paragraph described how he had marched
into a certain bank in order to get a draft cashed
(he was a’remittance-man) and, not being attended
to on the instant, strode into the manager’s room
and informed that august potentate that if he
didn’t at once produce the amount of coin men-
tioned in the draft, he (Bill Bagot) would, without
further warning, proceed to take the value of it
orit of his hide. The manager, not beirig accris-
tomed to talk of this truculently direct kind, sum-
moned a clerk, to whom he gave orders to call a
policeman for the purpose of ejecting this
unwelcome visitor. By the time the policeman
made his appearance, Mr. William Bagot had
given the bank-manager two magnificent black
eyes, which prevented him making an ap-
pearance at the bank for a full fortnight after-
wards, besides smashing everything that he, the
said William, could lay his hands upon, including
a large, fair-haired young clerk who parted his
hair in the middle and cherished the delusion that
he was a champion athlete. The paragraph con-
cluded by stating that for this peck of amusement
Mr. Bagot was awarded seven days’ imprison-
ment.
“This time,” he observed, “I’ll do six months
for him, if he doesn’t produce my money the
minute 1 see him.”
The quaint feature of the affair was that
although Bill Bagot was, in a manner of speaking,
or as far as an ordinary University man can be
expected to be, tolerably educated, he seemed to
know less than nothing about the commonest of
commercial transactions.
He thought that going to a bank was like going
to a sheep-station, and that the proper course to
pursue was to ignore all understrappers and make
straight for the “boss.”
“ I’m now about,” he said, replacing his pipe in
his pocket, “to sing you a song which has been
highly appreciated in the men’s huts on stations
all over the country from the Warrego to the
Murray. I composed it myself. Listen !”
And in a strong and pleasant tenor voice, which
had, however, suffered somewhat from exposure,
he sang us a rude ditty. I can only remember the
chorus, which was something like the following—
O, I once was a swell in Pell Mell,
The Prince of Wales then called me “Jack,”
But my heart now is lighter, my visions are brighter,
As I tramp on the wallaby track.
You may be sure we applauded. It is not often
that one has the opportunity of hearing a Sims
Reeves, even from the bush, in the streets at two
in the morning. M’Ginnis was delighted with
the performance. It gratified his taste for the
eecentric and the picturesque.
“ Now I’ll sing you “ The Heart Bowed Down;”
said Mr. Bagot, after he had recovered his breath;
And he sang it with a certain fury of emphasis
which was altogether flew to me.
“You may depend upon it,” said M’Ginnis,
Wlicr, iri spite df endless disappointments, saw the
raW materials df a ronlance in the most ordinary
'of incidents; “you may depend upon it that it
was a woman brought our frierid to his preserit
condition;”
And as if to justify the statement, Mr. Bagot
said suddenly : “ I’ll bet rieither df yoii can guess
what I’ve got inside that swag;’’
We guessed all sorts of things, from a pound of
dynamite to a native bear, but Bagot shook his
head,
“You could never guess if you were to try for a
month,” he exclaimed, “but 111 show you.” He
thereupon proceeded to unfasten his swag, and,
from the inmost core of it, produced a bundle of
letters yellow with age, and from the centre of the
bundle a splendid diamond engagement ring wdrich
flashed wondrously in the moonlight.
“ Aren’t you afraid to carry such a costly article
iii a swag?” said M‘Ginnis. “You might lose,
dr forget, the swag, or it might be taken from you
if thieves got to know what it contained.”
Bagot smiled grimly.
“ I’m not much afraid of being robbed,” he
replied, “ one man tried the game once, but he
never tried it again.”
This was said with such savage significance that
I asked : “ Where is that man now ? ”
“ In Hell, I reckon,” was the succinct response,
“ and as I have carried this packet of letters and
ring about with me for the last twenty years
there isn’t much fear of me losing or forgetting
them now, is there?”
“No,” said M‘Ginnis, and added, in a musing
tone, “ A ring like that must be a valuable pos-
session when a man is dead-broke. I daresay you
could pawn it for a fiver any day !”
Bagot surveyed him silently from head to foot
for a few moments, and I thought there was going
to be trouble, but our strange acquaintance con
trolled any belligerent desires he might have had
and remarked, in a tone of scornful compassion :
“ How should you know any better ! No, I never
tried to pawn it —not even when I’ve been
starving—not even when I would have pawned
my soul for a drink. But there are times,” his
voice sank to a tone of fierce pathos, “ when I feel
inclined to grind it into dust under my heel.
Good night, gentlemen, I’m going over to the
Domain to a particular spot under a ti-tree where
I always camp when I come to town. But before
we part I’ll dance the Highland fling for you.’
And he did—in very good style, too, and then
shouldered swag, which he had rolled up again
while talking. “ I shall be glad to see either or
both of you to-morrow,” he said as he started to
move off, “ that is, if I’m not too drunk by then
to recognise you. ”
We stood and watched him pass over Princes’
Bridge, a tall, gaunt figure in the moonlight, and
then went on our own way.
“She jilted him, of course,” said M’Ginnis,
pensively.
That was my first, and last, meeting with Bill
Bagot. On what dusty track art thou now travel-
ling, or by what vvaterhole in the wilderness
camping, O broken-hearted rollicker ?

A very jolly smoke-concert inaugurated
the opening of the new smoking-room at the
GrosVenor Hotel, which lias taken front rank
among Sydney hoitses patronised by the best class
of visitors. The cooling luxury of electric fans
Was much appreciated by the seventy guests who
enjoyed the delights of the convivial Ceremonies,
and the accommodating furnishings arid appoint-
ments of the large and lofty department—29 feet
by 20 feet —were gratefully acknowledged. The
room is hung with rich draperies, while the artist’s
skill has been employed on the walls to lure the
eye into a deceived belief of curtained and creased
walls that mirage airiness into the semblance of a
snuggery. Lounges and armchairs invite smokers
to sink into indolent comfort. The smoke-concert
was a success, and was agreeably fortified by a
capital supper, at which oyster-on-shell fought
digestively with cucumbers and tomato salads,
amid softening poultices of “bavaroisedu chocolat”
and ge noise glad,” &e.
A Sydney police-court witness told the
bench, the other day, that he knew that a certaip
man had been drunk because he asked for a drink
of water early iri the morning.
Does the Dibbs Ministry suppose dnyohe
is so idiotic as to believe that a Ministry, which has
about twenty bills all in the initial stages on the
business-paper, has any desire to get on with legis-
lation?
N.S.W. Upper House is blocking the
Elections Bill in the hope that the defeat of
Dibbs will kill the measure. Dibbs, on the other
hand, is waiting until the Council rejects the bill
in order to go to the country with a good cry.
N.S. Wales Assembly refused, by 54
votes to 46, to permit the Dibbs Ministry to take
new business after eleven. The Labour crowd at
once called on them to “ resign,” but, after a brief
colloquy on the Treasury benches, Dibbs, Barton
and Co. decided to continue to be kicked.
G. H. Reid says that in declaring himself
in favour of a land-tax in N.S. W. “ he only spoke
for himself” and had no right to do otherwise, since
his followers are all “free men.” Which simply
means that the “ great Freetrade party,” headed
by Reid, is a fraud, and that Reid knows it, for he
dares not now even say that his gang would tax
the land.

Australia is being rushed by vendors of
drink specifics. The invasion came from the
United States, the Paradise of patent-medicine
men where the alleged discoverers and inventors
of various advertised “Drink Cures” have been
and are still amassing colossal fortunes. The by-
wash lias slopped over into our country. The first
drink-“ specific ” to make any noise here was the
“ Keely Cure,” now being “ run ” in many of the
States by rnany-millioned (dollar) syndicates. A
few months since, a Major Calhoun, who, diplo-
matically enough, first loomed on the Australian
horizon as an accredited statistical official from
America, but who shortly assumed definite and
understandable shape as a quack-medicine man,
sought to boom in Sydney this “Double
Chloride of Gold, or Keely* Cure.” Calhoun
delivered a. lecture thereon in Sydney* claim-
on behalf of Professor Keely, altitudinous
success, with a very small percentage of failures.
The Major was simply loaded up with emotional
sympathy for the enslaved drunkard ; his soul
burned to snap the devil's-Chain that binds almost
all Christendom;
“ If you have such a salvation-wise yearning
for the drunkard, and if Dr. Keely is, like you,
bursting to redeem the bond-slaves of alcohol,”
asked, in effect, an earnest temperance-man,
;< vvhy does he not publish to the world his secret
for the benefit of the human race?”
“Re-kos, ive think,” drawled the apt Yankee
Major, “that it is as ?c-gitimate to make money
by doing good as in any other way.”
Which was a fair, if somewhat selfish, retort.
“ Also, fcc-kos, if the remedy were placed in the
hands of everybody, it would soon be dispensed
from every public-house bar-counter, and the
publicans would be able to sell the antidote with
the bane —to keep a man off and on, drunk or
sober; and thus it would do much harm ! ”
The Bulletin, I think, did a lot to laugh out
Major Calhoun’s lecture. That gallant Yankee
has disappeared.
* * *
Besides the “Keely Cure,” the conscience
of Australian drunkendom has been assailed by a
“Bichloride of Gold” remedy, a “Golden
Specific” patent, and a “Better than Gold”
crusade, otherwise known as the “Tyson Veget-
able Cure for Alcoholism.”
This article deals mainly with my personal ex-
periences of the much-vaunted “ Tyson Cure,”
the latest and best-puffed drink-specific yet placed
on the market.
Let me, in the first place, admit my readers to
some degree of personal knowledge.
My father died in India after a prolonged ill-
ness, Once, when one of my brothers insured his
life, he wrote down, in the “ proposal ” form
against the question, “Of what did your father
die? ” this answer—“ Of a riotous and dissipated
life.” The old man is said to have had a marvel-
lously tough constitution, but alcoholic abuses
broke it down. Ido not remember him at all,
having been only two or three years old when he
died; I was therefore supposedly the offspring
of the floodtido of his excesses—the youngest
born. As no other member of the family
has evinced the slightest weakness for alcoholic
abuse, it is a question open to argument whether or
not my failing is one due to hereditary predispo-
sition. I am in my fortieth year, and date my
drinking habits from the age of 21, previous to
which, with the most trivial exceptions--so few
that 1 can but indistinctly remember the special
occasions—l had never drunk any inebriating fluid,
nor had I smoked tobacco—save a boy’s first
deathly cigar.
Queensland incubated my drinking habits. How
these grew and grew is more than my memory can
recall or my philosophy explain. I certainly in-
herited all the vitality ascribed to my father, as
physical shock and almost-mortal strain upon
them proved time and again. The recuperative
life-principle was abundant, and that, perhaps,
engendered a careless recklessness consonant with
the habits of those blurred Queensland times;
Nineteen years ago “everybody ” —to use a phrase
that need not be misunderstood as absolute —
drank. To walk down any town street to
business after breakfast meant nearly always
a drink—sometimes two—at every public-house
between one’s “ diggings ” and One’s destination.
And every later walk meant ditto. The popular
drink of those days was so-called brandy; Whisky
had not begun tobefashionable inbush Queensland*
and beer was as naught. The nights were orgies,
and billiard-pools and dice Were the idols of the
floating bachelordom which thought it “saw life.”
Spells in the bush were of ghastly sobriety and
salt-meat diet; visits to any town meant alcoholic
riot.
It was the old story—the plaything became the
master.
Did I sit down to it tamely? Never; I have
not yet “thrown up the sponge.” During, at
least, 12 years I have periodically declared, with
each frenzied access of determination, that I must
and would conquer. More than once, I have
believed that I had conquered. Yet, time and
again, have I, unconcernedly and with, apparently,
open eyes, re-pledged myself to perdition.
Why ? Nay, I cannot tell why, although I
claim to be, and those who should be good judges
believe that I am, somewhat expertly self-intro-
spective.
# * *
Drunkards and dipsomaniacs, from J. B.
Gough down to the ordinary “habitual” known
to any and every one of the readers of this, will
tell you that there comes upon them at times,
more or less suddenly, an utterly irresistible
craving for alcohol.
All these witnesses to the contrary notwith-
standing, I assert that / know of no such craving
as ever having occurred to me before I took my
first glass after a period of total abstinence. After
I have taken my first night’s load of intoxicants,
the craving is there sure enough in all its terrors,
because all appetite for food has vanished,
and a substituted stimulus is required to nurse
immediate vitality. I crave so much then that I
haunt the hotel-door on the opening stroke of
6 a.m. But to crave for liquor while still teetotal
is a fact beyond my experience.
I do not say that Gough and the others draw
upon their imaginations when they tell of this
mysterious craving; but I repeat that lam
utterly unable to understand their tales or to be-
lieve them. That may be my misfortune.
Then, why do I drink ? Ido not know.
There are premonitory symptoms of restlessness
by which some of my intimates can foretell my
approaching relapse. Sometimes I myself have a
prophetic though vague inkling thereof; some-
times I don’t. Perhaps a “liver pill” taken in
time, or a hygienic change, would prevent the
calamity. Perhaps it wouldn’t. Sometimes a
sudden excitement of good or bad luck precipi-
tates it.. Sometimes the meeting of an old and
long-unseen friend excuses it. Sometimes there is
no visible cause or pretence whatever ; yet, while
sober, I turn mechanically into a bar and call for
a drink, in so neutral a mood as not to be worthy
the name of impulse—just as one following one’s
nose may turn suddenly to the right or left,
without thought or premeditation. Although, in
my case, there are known dangers ahead, yet
there is no feeling of apprehension.
Why? Let brain-doctors explain, for lam con-
vinced that the mainspring of dipsomania lies in
the brain.
# * *
It will be seen that I draw a distinction
between drunkards and dipsomaniacs. The sup-
ported theory is that the drunkard drinks because
he likes drink, as a boy may like toffee —inordin-
ately ; whereas the dipsomaniac drinks because
an instinct impels him thereto, as a dog eats
grass; It is a curious therapeutical experience
with mo that a drinking-bout has often staved off
illnesses that were alarmingly threatening, and has
even cured me of sickness actually contracted.
It is true that a “ bender ” always superinduced
an illness of its own—the d.t. of recovery—a phase
that, in my case, never yet came on until (my
system being sunersaturated to nausea with drink)
I have “knocked it off,” a feat which, by the
way, I am compelled to do in one decisive, horrors-
breeding act. “Tapering it off” is with me
impossible, and only means a second edition of
excess. Others assure me that they cannot for
their lives leave it off “ suddenly.”
I am asked what opinions my friends hold of
me—when sober, and when drunk, I can honestly
say they all like me and are very kind to me
while I am in my right mind ; as to the other, let
me quote the words of one who has acquired a
friend’s right to exercise free speech : “You’re a
vile blackguard when you’re drunk, and deserve
to be hunted like a dog.” }
That is scorching enough to consume anyone’s
vanity.
All this prate respecting myself has been in-
troduced in order that readers may understand
the manner of man who agreed to submit himself,
as a “test case,” to the “Tyson Sanatorium,
Randwick,” (Sydney, N.S.W.), and the spirit in
which he approached that treatment.
I claim to be categorised as a dipsomaniac, or a
spasmodic drunkard ; and not as a confirmed sot
or perennial “ boozer.” Further, if it were
possible, I would gladly give 10 years out of my
span of life and 10 years’ earnings, if I could be
absolutely and unfailingly “ cured ” of this inter-
mittent distemper.
It goes without saying that my desire is also
the earnest desire of thousands of others. A
corollary is that we care nothing for the source
whence the deliverance comes, so long as it does
come ; nothing for the scientific or medical status
of the deliverer, who—should he present himself
—may, according to the medical faculty, be the
veriest quack among quacks ; he would neverthe-
less, be, to the drunkard, a saviour. All heaven
and all earth and all hell could not influence
drink-victims against a “ Certain Cure,” even
though Beelzebub himself were its sponsor.
But, on the other hand, anyone who holds out,
as a boasted “Cure,” a pretence that leads the
earnest into false hopes, ami belies its asserted
functions, commits upon the community a fraud
which demands exposure and deserves execration.

Sydney was tolerably well-prepared for
the “ Tyson ” advertising-boom by the echoes of
reports of marvellous “cures” alleged to have
been effected in Melbourne. Police-magistrate
Panton, of the latter city, turned over several
notorious “cases” to the Tyson Sanatorium,
St. Kilda, and these were claimed to be cured
everlastingly. It is patent that this is a state-
ment to be received with caut’on. The Melbourne
Sanatorium was only opened about August or
September last, and nothing under at least a
twelvemonth of sustained victory can, by any
stretch of imagination, be relied upon as a per-
manent cure. Again, these police-court turn-
overs were specially under a moral compulsion to
get, or at least to seem to get, cured ; any such
sensitive patient—and your alcoholic slave is un-
usually sensitive when “recovering”—must have
felt himself a quasi-prisoner under exceptionally
kind treatment during good behaviour.
As against this it is asserted that many wealthy
voluntary patients, to whom teetotalism did not
mean the regaining of a billet, or other means of
livelihood, have been similarly cured permanently.
Amongst others are at least three pressmen known
to me either personally or by craft reputation.
No. 1, who is described as having been a lost
vaurien for at least a couple of decades, is now
represented as wearing the clean garb of sobriety,
and as being an enthusiastic nuisance as an
honorary volunteer, tout, canvasser, and advocate
of the “Tyson Cure.”
No. 2, a brilliant and versatile writer, was, it is
alleged, taken from his supposed death-bed in a
hospital and turned out in three weeks a cured
man—a valuable instructor lent anew to a grateful
world.
No. 8 is a brilliant but erratic humourist, who
bad acquired a mammoth reputation for bibbing.
Nos. 1 and 2 are to me cases of hearsay only;
No. 3 I have conversed with since his advertised
transformation, for he came to Sydney on a brief
holiday trip, and visited the Randwick Sana-
torium while I was an inmate. He was super-
latively enthusiastic over his own “cure,” and
his own faith certainly deserves to remove all the
mountains that can possibly block the future, and
should keep him permanently sober. He related
to me—and I have before me a newspaper article
in which he makes similar assertions—how, for 25
years, he had never been without a craving for
alcohol; how, though he had been a teetotaller at
different times for periods ranging from three
months up to, in one case, two years, ho had never
been free from the desire for liquor, although
strength of will and considerations of prudence
had kept him sober ; how he went to the Tyson
Sanatorium an unbeliever; how he got specially
“tanked up” for the ordeal; and how he was
“knocked out in one act,” and is now, for the
first time in a quarter of a century, without the
craving or the least desire for alcohol.
This man I know. He is a credible witness,
and his statement must be accepted with respect.
But it must also be critically weighed.
He is a man on the rebound of an experience.
Is he self-deluded and self-deluding? What kind of
man must he be who, possessing a craving for
alcohol, can, by sheer force of will and the opera-
tion of prudential considerations, keep teetotal for
two whole years ? Did ever a dipsomaniac consult
prudential considerations ? Not a fleabite worth !

rpALES OF THE CONVICT SYSTEM-
PRICE—ONE SHILLING.
Did ever ah epileptic abstain from falling into fits
by teAson of prudential considerations ? The
argument of the alleged “ drunkard curer ” being
that “ inebriety is a disease, and can be cured by
drugs,” places it in exactly the same therapeutic
light as epilepsy. Can an epileptic abstain totally
from fits for two years by sheer force of will ?
The candour of No. 3 is worthy of admiration,
but it destroys his case as a test one.
Here it may be interpolated that there are, un-
fdrtunately, few things so common as the habit of
Self-deception among dipsomaniacs. In the first
glamour of supposed emancipation, we assume too
hastily the accomplishment Of our dearest desire.
We rejoice so exultantly over our taken-for-
granted victory that we want our friends to whoop
liseans of triumph with us. I have known the
false joy so often that I am sceptical of every birth
df new faith.
Of the One-yeat afid two-years’ “Tyson cures ”
alleged to have been wrought in America, as well
as in the shorter “cures ” credited to Melbourne,
I cannot take serious cognisance. They are at
present to me but hearsay evidence. But even
had all these appearances of cure happened under
my own personal observation, I should still sus-
pend judgment for time’s endorsement; and, even
after that, they would weigh as nothing to me
whereinsoever they differed from my own personal
experience. That (to me) constitutes absolute and
unmistakable knowledge. That, at least, is free
from self-deception, and based upon a fair,
unshrinking, watchful, and thoughtful endurance
of the test conditions prescribed by the vendors of
the “Tyson Cure” themselves. I accepted
nothing on trust, but I shrank from nothing—not
even from whisky, when it was offered me,
though my experience does not approve of grog-
continuance when curing grog-disease.
# # *
Before the “ Tyson Cure” came actually
to Sydney, a broad-minded and earnest clergyman
had, with others, started a Retreat for Inebriates
at Middle Harbour, under the title of the “ Echo
Farm.” At that retreat moral influences, pious
surroundings, and prayer are relied upon to tee-
totalise dipsomaniacs.
Now, this is dead against my preconceived
theories respecting intermittent drunkenness.
Such a programme would seem to be founded upon
the assumption that dipsomania is a vice and not
a disease.
Consequently, when I read, in a newspaper
report, that the Echo Farm has accommodation
“for ten, including the manager,” the retort rose
merrily—“ Nine Jolly Good Fellows and One
Shocking Example!”
Again, the reporter seemed bent upon provoking
scoff when he wrote (after asserting that the Farm
has more of the character of a home than of a red-
tape establishment); —
The place is conducted with the strictest economy by
business men, and the finances are on a sound footing.
A home ! Economy and cure by prayer do not
recommend themselves to my way of thinking.
Further, the Farm has a history. It was built by
convicts, and has since been a baby-farm ! “A
suitable nidus,” was my first catch-thought, “ for
delirium tremens,” Convict spooks nursing the
shades of cherubim !
Once at the Home, the inebriate desiring a “booze”
would not find the game worth the candle. On arrival,
the patient is treated thus : Liquor is at once cut off, and
tonics are given, with sleeping-draught if necessary. If
the appetite is impaired, etc.
If the appetite is impaired ! That reporter had a
galloping imagination born of inexperience.
Imagine a d.t. recoverer, or any inebriate, whose
appetite is not impaired ! The report made me
feel that, sooner than enter such a home, I would
prefer to qualify for seven years in Berrima gaol
by setting fire to the Farm premises.
Yet who knows? Since harbouring those
thoughts, I have heard of an ex-public-man, with
whom I am personally acquainted—one of the
acknowledged brightest intellects in all Austra-
lasia who has been returned to his family
from the Echo Farm, to all appearance
“ cured ” in at least as permanent a degree as
any cases from the Melbourne Tyson Sanatorium.
True, the element of confirmation by time is yet
wanted, but that is also absent as yet from
the Melbourne Tyson cases. Further, it is claimed
on this Echo Farm patient’s behalf that he has
also found “saving grace”—a permanent factor
when a man’s soul-belief undergoes a radical
change. Do not all Biblical students know that
it took something like a stroke of lightning (as it
appears to the unbeliever) to convert Saul of
Tarsus ? Is not the well-known Barrister ,of
Sydney, a similar example of sudden and ap-
parently miraculous conversion? Has not the
shock (or fright) of almost killing a clergyman
turned the erstwhile bibulous Tom Walker, M.P.
(N.S.W.), into a teetotaller, though whether he
remains a Freethinker or not is not within my
ken.
In the face of these latter facts, I, as an honest
critic, must revise my first antipathy to the Echo
Farm, and suspend my individual judgment, with
the reservation that prayer and moral suasion and
pious surroundings (to which, I understand, I
must add hard manual labour —an excellent tonic
for inebriates) are admittedly calculated to jointly
succeed with some forms of nervous hysteria.
And, at any rate, the Echo Farm is not run as
a money-making concern.
In this category also may be classed the methods
of rescue peculiar to the Salvation Army.
* # #
Holding, as I did before entering the
“ Tyson Sanatorium,” Randwick, the above-
described antipathetic notions concerning the
Echo Farm methods, it may readily be con-
ceived with what hope I welcomed the tidings of
an entirely different course of treatment, a course
based upon my own tenaciously-held theory that
drunkenness is a disease, and that there must be
a medicinal remedy for that disease, just as the
pharmacopoeia has supplied nitro-glycerine as a
specific for angina pectoris, the malady to which
the Great Higinbotham, of Victoria, ultimately
succumbed on the last day of last year.
Dr. Luther B. Tyson, of Ohio, IJ.S. A., claims
to have discovered that very desideratum —a
certain remedy for dipsomania. His remedies—
for there are two mixtures in his treatment—are
(as I understand the arrangement) rented to an
Australian syndicate calling itself “The Tyson
Sanatorium Co. of Victoria,” which syndicate has
the sole control of the sale of the “Tyson Vege-
table Remedies ” in Australasia and India, and
manages, for its own profit, the various Tyson
Sanatoriums it has established or is about to
establish. The “secret” of Dr. Tyson’s
“ remedy ” remains with himself alone, and will,
it is puffingly stated, only be revealed at his death
to his son, who, it is also asserted, is being brought
up to the profession of medicine. The Victorian
syndicate receives all the physic—which hereafter
will be technically called “ treatment,” such being
the Sanatorium vogue—direct from Tyson in
America, and merely dispenses it, or sells it, with
instructions, for “ home treatment.”
It Was at the end of one of an intermittent
series of alcoholic orgies that I,was induced to try
the “Tyson cure.” I hailed as a Chance of pos-
sible physical salvation the opportunity that
enabled me to enter the Randwick Sanatorium as
a test-patient. That I had sufficient stimulus to
justify the high hopes that both my friends and I
indulged in, let the following quotations from the
advertised claims of the “ Tyson Cure ” testify
We proceed upon the theory that alcoholism affects
directly that portion of the brain by which the will-power
is exercised, and that the diseased condition is subject to
proper treatment as much as any other physical ailment.
We prove our theory by our work. ..."
This treatment and cure is (sic) far superior to all others,
It has been put to the test in many cases, and never
failed in a single instance. It removes the desire for
intoxicants of all kinds. . . . The Worst cases of
inebriety succumb to its influences aS readily as those more
moderate. ...
We require patients to take the remedy for 21 days*
according to directions, and they will find their appetite
for all intoxicants gone for ever, their physical condition
bettered, their minds clear, and their will-power fully
restored
In all forms of treatment we place no restraint upon
the patient, he is allowed perfect freedom of action, he is
permitted to keep 01 using liquor, hut usually the treat-
ment stops the alcoholic crave or desire in from 6 to 24
hours.
And from a special report written to order in
Melbourne: —
Desire killed by Disgust—that is a plain statement of
the case. . . If weak, through fatigue, or persecuted
beyond endurance by the gnawing of the Drink Disease,
no attempt is made to bring him to total abstinence
forthwith. If he desire it, pe is supplied by the Resident
Physician with spirits or wines in such quantities as may
stimulate him, or later induce repose. . . . Plainly, if
there is much alcohol in your system, it [the treatment]
will make you, for the first few hours, feel strange sensa-
tions. Very quickly you will begin to understand that
this new “ familiar” you have taken to yourself will not
tolerate alcoholism in any shape or form w'hatever. You
may drink if you like ; if you do, you will be sick, and in
a day, or at most two, this conviction becomes estab-
lished. The spirit, which of old cheered, will now act
but as an emetic, and consequently will be shunned as
such.
Clearly, here was the ideal cure for which I had
for years been waiting. It was according to my
own theory that dipsomania is essentially a brain-
disease. It professed to restore lost Will-power.
Further examination of its submitted details
revealed an apparently rational mode of treat-
ment.
As to my capability of forming an opinion con-
cerning the rationale of any described system, I
may mention that I am a registered pharma-
ceutical chemist of one of the Australian pro-
vinces. When in the drug business, I have some-
times, as all chemists do, trenched upon a doctor’s
prerogative and “prescribed” over the counter.
But I have never administered to any person, of
my own prescription, an active drug that I had
not already tested on my own system, sometimes
to three or four times the maximum dose ruled by
the British Pharmacopoeia. Being also experi-
mentally curious, there are few of the swift
officinal poisons that I have not tested on myself
to the verge of danger, in order to try to
thoroughly understand the symptoms resulting
from their over-use.
Mr. Frank Sterling, superintendent of the
newly - opened Tyson Sanatorium, Randwick,
having offered to accept from The Bulletin, as a
test-case, the worst inebriate at that moment
available, I was offered the chance of being cured,
once and for all. With mingled feelings of doubt
and hope, I accepted Mr. Sterling’s offer.
Doubt was present as the sediment of past
experiences. I have swallowed many alleged
“drink cures,” from decoctions of Cinchona
(Cinchona Jtuhra), “vinegars” of quassia, &c., to
Matthew Burnett’s once-favourite “ Essence of
Cocoa ” as he called it, but a Coca mixture as I
suspect. All these have failed. The only remedy
that I have heard of, and have not tried, is one
credited to a Russian doctor —the hypodermic
injection, once a day, of one minim (drop) of a
solution of strychnine, bub the strength of that
doctor’s Liquor Strychnice was not given in
the recipe I saw. But hope nevertheless pre-
dominated in my mind. Had it not been so, I
should not have cared publicly to present myself
as an otherwise desperate incurable. Nor would
I have given myself up to three weeks of enforced
seclusion at Christmastide—thus isolating myself
from home ties during the Christmas holidays,
and, more trying still, during the celebration of
“Hogmanay”—that eve which all dipsomaniacs,
whether Scotch or not, fervently celebrate. (I
am Scotch by descent, though sadly mongrelised
by birth and mixture.)
# # #
On Monday evening, December 12, I pre-
sented myself ab Selborne (the Sanatorium),
Randwick, with a letter of introduction to Mr.
Sterling, who received me with every courtesy.
“But I shall not be able to take you in till
Thursday next. We have only sufficient ‘treat-
ments ’ at present here to suffice for the One or two
patients in the institution, but there are more
‘ treatments ’ coming by the boat that is due in
Sydney in a day or two. If you come on Thurs-
day, I shall be happy to receive you, and we’ll fix
you right up,” said Sterling, with a cheerful
American accent.
We had a long talk, in the course of which he
explained that all that was required of me was to
take the treatment regularly every hour, and to
give my word of honour that I would not leave
the grounds without permission. “As for whisky,
you can swim in it if you like, but you won’t look
at it soon,” said Sterling. Then he told me of
one patient already in the institution ; how that
poor fellow had been received in a deplorable con-
dition, wrong side up; how he had been allowed
whisky for one or two days, but had refused it
with disgust on the third; and how, already, he
was an assured “ cure.” Presently, to me, who
was quiet as one is when “ whipping the cat ”
“ Would you like a glass of whisky now?”
“ Well, I would,” I replied, for I felt weak with
the journey.
The dram and the good account given of the other
patient cheered me up greatly, and I left, with the
understanding that I was to take up my abode at
Selborne on Thursday, December 15.
How I did so, and what I there experienced,
must be related in my next chapter.

THE ESTATE OF
FONTAINEBLEAU,
WENTWORTH FALLS.
rpniS MAGNIFICENT ESTATE of 239 ACRES has been
A- surveyed bv Messrs. Miller and Lewis, of Pitt Street,
Sydney, into 138 Allotments, ranging from 1 Acre
Residential Blocks to 10i Acres, situate only 500 yards
from the WENTWORTH FALLS RAILWAY STATION,
on the opposite side of the line. It embraces all that fine
and elevated land opposite the mansion of R. M. Pitt,
Esq., whose splendid garden excites the admiration of
every passenger on the Great Western railway.
When the delightful climate of Wentworth Falls is taken
into consideration, the place may be safely described as
The Madeira of the Bine Mountains.
Delicate constitutions and worn-out business men are
benefited equally by the refreshing purity of the 'mountain
air, and the estate is not surpassed for residential purposes.
The FONTAINEBLEAU ESTATE
is well described by the poet, viz.: —
The waratah, all gleaming red,
Lifting in pride its stately head,
Shines through the clustering ferns ;
While as the wattle’s yellow bloom
Falls in soft showers, its deep perfume
The air to sweetness turns.
Would you this haunt of beauty know?
’Tis the charming Estate of Fontainebleau t _
The Blaxland Road is now being made from the Railway
fence, and, as it runs right through this magnificent estate,
it will, when finished, be without exception the finest
Carriage Drive on the Mountains.
The FONTAINEBLEAU ESTATE is the most elevated
and beautiful about Wentworth Falls—-far and away
superior to the land on the other side of the line. The
picturesque views and the extreme fertility of the soil
renders the place very attractive, and specially adapted
for Fruit or Flower Gardens, Orchards or Dairy Farms,
for which Nature seems to have intended it.
fW Early Buyers will do well to secure their Lots at
once, as they are likely to largely advance in value. The
terms are liberal, to suit all buyers. For lithos., and all
particulars, apply to the Proprietor—
