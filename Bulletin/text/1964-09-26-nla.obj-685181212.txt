BUSINESS TRIP TO
How to make it a Pleasure Trip, too!
Plan to combine business with pleasure
when you make that business expedition to
Britain. Begin by enjoying the relaxations
of a sea trip there and back. And linger
while you’re there—long enough to explore
such places as Shakespeareland or the Lake
District or Scotland, Wales or Northern
Ireland.

way around the Old Course at St. Andrews
—in the land where golf was born! Or plan
simply especially if your wife is travel-

swinging day or two in the green and
pleasant countryside of England with its
old world villages, its friendly inns (you
can bed and breakfast in one for around
35/-), its leafy lanes.

LETTERS
TO THE
EDITOR
ACADEMICS AND THE LAW
Sir,
Two comments need urgently to be
made on Sir Robert Menzies' latest essay
in Australian legalism.
1. The nature of our legal system, a
democracy, involves an admission of
legal fallibility. The laws may be changed.
Even the Constitution may be changed.
This means that every citizen under our
legal system is entitled to criticise the
Constitution and the laws. This in turn
means that academics can claim “privi-
leges unrecognised by the law” if this
means that the proper performance of
their job requires certain changes in the
law (relating e.g.. to censorship). To
claim a privilege, meaning an extant
right, which is “unrecognised by the law”
would be rather futile.
2. What I suspect Sir Robert Menzies
to mean when he says that academics
should not claim “privileges unrecog-
nised by the law’’ is that academics
should not claim “privileges unrecog-
nised by what Sir Robert Menzies opines
to be the law” Indeed, they would be
foolish to ignore the opinion of such a
great lawyer though, again, they are
entitled to express disagreement with it.
But surely in saying that “the rules which
control the right of the university to
dismiss (an academic) are the same as
the rules that apply in any contract of
employment”. Sir Robert overlooks an-
other characteristic of our legal system
The plain contract of master and servant
between university and academic has to
be construed by the courts.
Now, a university is no normal master
snd an academic no normal servant. In
the light of this fact might not the courts
find there to be implied terms ensuring
greater fixity of tenure for the academic
than for, say, a bank clerk? Sir Robert
may be ignoring the amenability of the
courts to the facts of life.

“PEACE” CONGRESS
Sir,
While continuing “Peace” Congresses
and “Peace” Committees etc. have been
raising money for “Peace”'' issuing hun-
dreds of thousands of expensive leaflets
and booklets, placing expensive adver-
tisements in the Press, Radio, TV, financ-
ing jaunts of “Peace” delegates around
the world, particularly to Communist
countries, there is no record of one word
of criticism from them of the aggression
by Communists on the defenceless
peoples of Tibet, India, South Vietnam,
Burma, Taiwan, Korea and every other
“hot” spot in the world where Com-
munists are the aggressors.
In the meantime, without ballyhoo, and
without the benefit of the Communist
Party, the United Nations Association of
Australia has raised a million pounds in
its continuing Freedom from Hunger
Campaign, and organised a most success-
ful Refugee Year.
It is no accident that New Zealand
has been dropped from the organisation.
It is no accident that Communist aggres-
sion is never attacked while defenders of
freedom are slandered and demonstrated
against. The test of sincerity for those
peace lovers who are sponsoring this
“peace movement” will be whether or
not they speak and act against the only
aggressor in the world today, Commun-
ism, the greatest disturber of peace the
world has ever seen.

POLITICS IN MALAWI
Sir,
I apologise for the lateness of this
comment on a letter which appeared in
your issue of August 1, headed “Politics
in Malawi”. It takes more than a month
for The Bulletin to penetrate to this
part of Africa.
Mr F. H. Sibson drew some startling
conclusions from a report in the review
"East Africa and Rhodesia” on a petition
from the “Mbadwa Council of Nyasa-
land Citizens”. I have not visited Malawi
personally, so I will not directly chal-
lenge the authenticity of the facts in the
report. I have discussed the matter with
my Malawian students. They were of the
opinion that the council was an artificially
created party of “moderates” supported
by European interests based in Southern
Rhodesia, but they did not deny the
possibility of some intimidation. Their
personal observations did not substantiate
the petitioners' claims that thousands had
been threatened and thousands of homes
burned.
While not challenging the facts, 1 do
wish to cast doubt upon their source.
“East Africa and Rhodesia” is a paper
with which few Australians will be
familiar. It is valued by students of Africa
because it reproduces speeches and other
out-of-the-way research material, of
which the petition is an example. It is
also regarded as a cranky representative
of diehard conservatism and little at-
tention is paid to its commentary.
Mr Sibson quotes with approval an
Anglican paper from Northern Rhodesia
which feels that British policy has failed
because “Britain has never ruled an Afri-
can colony with the despotism of the new

African leaders”. This ignores the fact
that British colonial policy never pre-
tended to be democratic until the 1950 s
and that, after the change in attitudes
then, the key concern was with self-rule
rather than democracy. It was hoped
that African leaders would choose to
follow a pattern of government similar
to that in Britain and that they would
appreciate the value of non-African
minorities to their economies, but it was
to be the choice of the African leaders
and not of Britain. Experience in East
Africa is showing that the future of non-
African minorities, although clouded in
uncertainty still, is not as black as was
predicted by the pessimists before the
granting of independence. The fact that
African leaders have decided that British
democracy does not meet their particular
requirements and have constructed a
more authoritarian system is no valid
reason for asserting that British policy
has failed. The various ex-colonies are
now fully viable independent states with
their destinies determined by indigenous
leaders. Bearing in mind the Congo cala-
mity, this would seem to be a sufficient
measure of success for any former colon-
ising power.

RELIGION
Sir,
Your correspondent, Kevin J. O’Neill
(12/9/64) in patting Mr Wetherell on
the head, seems to suggest that if only
we could get rid of “religion” most of
the violence in the world would forthwith
cease. I don’t know how much Mr O'Neill
knows about religion or history, but it
is pretty clear that he doesn’t know much
about mankind. Crimes have been com-
mitted in the name of Christ and in the
name of Buddha, but neither Christ nor
Buddha would be very happy about
them. Most of us are not prepared to
banish the noblest of men from our
thoughts for the crimes of others com-
mitted in their names.

NEW ZEALAND
Sir,
I was glad to see Maurice Shadbolt’s
article on New Zealand. I agree with the
comment on Michael Savage, our first
Labor Premier, and John A. Lee, but
why the wonder “that anything durable
was created at all”? With Finance Minis-
ter Nash and Public Works Minister
Semple, surely durability was to be ex-
pected. To see Semple’s monument one
has merely to look at the highways and
other outstanding public works achieved
in his day on a scale never before known
in this country. Mr Nash is still with us,
and in the House; he will be remembered
as a finance administrator of outstanding
ability.
I shall look for more stimulating
articles from Maurice Shadbolt, and
hope that they will help the image of
New Zealand to be reflected accurately
in the minds of our Australian cousins.

“THE INTELLECTUAL ELITE”
Sir,
The alarming clarity with which J. M.
French (12/9/64) reveals himself as the
typically intolerant, anti-intellectual pro-
duct of our great Australian education
system should encourage reformers like
Professor May to continue their battle
against ignorance with renewed vigor.
Your correspondent’s attitude towards
anything which does not conform with
the glorious Australian image of the
bronzed athlete —mindless or otherwise
•—can only be regarded as evidence of
his own inadequacy in confronting the
“other” side of life which he chooses to
regard as contemptible.
His brand of pity for those he labels
the mentally sick is the cruel sort which
prevents the acceptance of these people
into a “normal”, “healthy” society even
after they have undergone such treatment
as is available to them, while his resent-
ful way of referring to the intellectual
elite shows that he belongs to the throng
of those who cannot bear to admit that
one man’s mind can be greater than
another’s, because his own is so narrow.
ELIZABETH OLIVER

FLEMINGTON
Sir,
The article on racing by “Discus”
(12/9/64) was most amusing. Any regu-
lar Melbourne racegoer would be very
pleased to find the facilities at Fleming-
ton which he mentions. However, he
didn’t mention the mud and slush in the
car parks, the poor standard of catering
for the general public, the distances be-
tween the various facilities, which is
especially hard on the older racegoer.
Elderly members of the public have to
climb lots of steps, whereas an escalator
has been installed for the benefit of
members.

OAKLEIGH ELECTIONS
Sir,
Your “Toothless Tiger” article
(12/9/64) made reference to the humili-
ating defeat suffered by the ALP at the
hands of Messrs Gilhooley and Oakley,
the rebel councillors in the Oakleigh
Municipality elections. As the endorsed
ALP candidate opposing both Gilhooley
and the Independent Liberal candidate,
R. J. Lovell, in the Monash Ward I
wish to clear up a couple of points.
Firstly, there was no endorsed ALP
candidate opposing Mr Oakley in the
Clayton Ward, so he could hardly have
inflicted a humiliating defeat upon the
ALP. Secondly, the first count figures for
Monash showed that Gilhooley polled
1826 votes, 667 ahead of the ALP can-
didate, and Lovell polled 1854 votes,

695 ahead of the ALP candidate. This
was hardly a humiliating defeat, when
one considers that both Lovell and Gil-
hooley are seasoned councillors and
campaigners in council elections.
Municipal elections are somewhat dif-
ferent to State and Federal; a lot depends
on the local identity of the candidates,
per medium of the local Press. The ALP
candidate was unknown to 90 per cent
of the ratepayers in the Monash Ward
until about a fortnight prior to the elec-
tions, so I would hardly call 667 votes
behind at the first count “humiliating”.

I read with interest Malcolm Ellis’s

centenary is being celebrated in a practi-
cal manner by a local numismatic society
and by the Australian Documentary
Facsimile Society. The latter is planning
a unit which will combine a facsimile of
the holey dollar with a reproduction of
the associated proclamation by Governor
Macquarie. A few memberships of the
society are still available for those in-
terested.

Sir,
I wish to congratulate your journal for
the consistently high quality of its tele-

or restrained from offering intelligent ap-
praisals of television at its best and
worst, it is heartening to find your pub-
lication assuming the responsibility so
well.

BAHA’I
Sir,
May I draw to your attention the
correct spelling of Baha’i referred to by
your art critic John Henshaw in his re-
view (22/8/64) of the recent lan Fair-

With one of only four existing Baha’i
Houses of Worship in the world atop
Tumble Down Dick on Sydney’s north
side, one would have thought that your
critic, sub-editor, proof-reader, whoever,
would have known the correct spelling

Which computer plays'Waltzing Matilda”?
LEonn
Some people whistle while they work.
Computers hum. Unless you feed
them with a programme which gives
them enough essential data to burst
into song. Recently we fed all 181
notes of “Waltzing Matilda” into our
own LEO 111. “Sing ” we commanded,
and LEO 111 sang.
Everyone was impressed except
LEO 111. “Kids’ stuff,” it thought
darkly, “they’re making a player
piano out of me. Don’t they know I
speak three languages, including
‘CLEO’ and ‘lntercode’? I can read
and write any one a 1,000 times
faster than a University Professor
can sign his name. I’m multi-dex-
terous with programmes. I can pro-
cess two (or even more) completely
different problems at the same time
without getting a digit mixed, yet
they’re impressed by mere music.
Huh!”
LEO 111 is not a boaster. In its
brain of brains it knows it’s good.
But like all computers LEO 111 is
only as good as the use that is made
of it. And English Electric-LEO
Computers have a team of consul-
tants, programmers, operating and
maintenance staff, backed by the
team of engineers that built the
world’s first commercial data pro-
cessing computer in 1947—which was
Genesis for the computer business!
In addition to our many installa-
tions throughout Britain, English
Electric-LEO Computers have
already supplied, and are maintain-
ing, computers in Australia. The Aus-
tralian installations include Tube-
makers of Australia, The University
of Sydney, The Shell Company of
Australia, and The Colonial Mutual
Life Assurance Society.

HONG
KONG
Rural Hong Kong a water buffalo in a paddy field.
A far cry from the tempestuous business life of Hong
Kong. Yet only two or three miles from the very centre
of Hong Kong’s business district. But this is Hong Kong.
This is the gateway to the East, the only city in the world
■where East truly meets West, where there is complete
coexistence of the old and the new and where the
mysticism of the Orient comes face to face with the reality
of the West. Hong Kong, including Kowloon and the New
Territories, not to mention the surrounding hundreds of
tiny islands, has a total area of only 398£ square miles.
Yet in this area abounds some of the most breathtaking
panoramic views in the world. Because Hong Kong is a free
port, many goods, from radios to raw silks, may be purchased
at prices less than in their country of origin. The best ‘Chinese
Chow’ in the world is supplemented by food from any
country you care to name. Air-conditioned accommodation,
from a single room to a luxurious suite, is abundant. So
for a holiday that’s different, take a trip to Hong Kong.
Take a Hong Kong vacation. If you’re on business plan
your itinerary so that you can spend some time in Hong
Kong. You’ll be glad you did. For further information
contact the Hong Kong Tourist Association, Anchor
House, 234 George Street, Sydney, N.S.W. Australia.


A better
way to do
business
in Hong Kong
Make the Hongkong Hilton
your base. It’s right in the heart
of the major business and
governmental section of the
Colony. In fact, a lot of business
is done in the hotel’s own
conference rooms, with
bilingual stenographers on
hand to help.
When you’re not working, you
have the Peak Tram at your
doorstep, the Kowloon Ferry
nearby. You'll relax in the
hotel’s 80-foot outdoor
swimming pool, on a brigantine
for harbour cruises—and enjoy
several superb restaurants.
Fifty of Hong. Kong’s finest
shops have branches right in
the hotel’s arcade.

National Notebook
Cashing In On Corn
V7ou might think that the surest way to
lose money would be to buy up a
derelict building slightly out of the city
and turn it into a Victorian-style music
hall. That’s what everyone told George
F. Miller when, late in 1961, he started
to dispense food, drink and melodrama
in North Sydney.
Now, nearly three years later, the
Music Hall is established and prosperous.
“When you started, I wouldn’t have given
you an overdraft of sixpence,” an
astonished bank manager told Mr Miller
recently.
Since Victoriana and Edwardiana are
in just now, its early popularity might
have stemmed from snob-appeal, but its
continuing vitality argues against this. So
does the composition of the audiences,
who range from children taken there for
holiday treats to nonagenarians celebra-
ting their birthdays.
Many people see each play more than
once, and an American woman living in
Sydney (who always brings overseas
visitors to the Music Hall) has seen the
present show 10 times.
Mr Miller feels that these old melo-
dramas provide as much of a safety valve
for adults at the Beatles do for adoles-
cents. That’s why audience participation
is encouraged.
“It gives people a chance to let off
steam,” he says. “Mind you, that doesn’t
mean throwing peanuts or cigarette pack-
ages we had to put a stop to that when
we first opened. You can’t ask a good
actor to go on stage just as an Aunt
Sally. But we do encourage the witty
remark from the audience and we do
get some remarkably good wits.”
George Miller started his career in
melodrama in Melbourne in 1960 when a
friend asked him to stage a show in a
struggling restaurant. Given a free choice,
he decided to produce “East Lynne”.
“By chance I'd found an old script,”
he says. “It was corny but it had every-
thing sex, pathos, drama and a
tear-jerking deathbed scene.” His theatri-
cal judgment proved right —“East
Lynne” ran in Melbourne for a record-
breaking 23 months.
When he came to Sydney (chiefly, he
says, because of the more liberal liquor
laws), he had trouble in finding premises,
but finally discovered an old theatre in
Neutral Bay which, after dying of inani-
tion as a picture theatre, had gone
through brief and damaging periods as
a roller skating rink and a rock ’n’ roll
joint.
Though the company has a stockpile
of authentic Victorian melodramas, they
intend to experiment next time with a
play written by one of the actors, Barry
Creyton.
It’s a rousing old-style western barn-
stormer called How The West Was Lost,
developed from an original idea of the
Music Hall’s producer John Faassen.
“But the spirit will be the same,” Mr
Miller insists. “We’re trying to re-create
a vanished age, when Our Dear Queen
was on the throne, the Empire stood
firm, there were no atom bombs and
nothing Freudian just confidence and
faith, and tremendous gusto.”
First Impressions
Thirst impressions are just as lasting in
A Sydney as anywhere else. New
staff member Hugh Curnow recently
arrived from Brisbane, diligently making
notes all the way:
One of the first things you notice
driving into Sydney from the north, he
reports, is a sign near Hornsby announ-
cing the sale of high octane racing fuel
at a public service station. Less chal-
lenging is one of the last things you
see before you get to the Cross —a neon-
lit, immobile arrow inserted through the
opening in the centre of a car tyre.
Apparently that great arrow is also less
distracting than it used to be. “It used to
prod into that tyre 20 times a minute,”
a taxi-driver told us. “Really caught
your eye then. But they had to stop it.
Drivers used to watch it instead of the
car in front. They were piling up in
William Street like a stack of cards,” he
said. Allowing for the degree of exaggera-
tion, you still see what he means.
High octane or not.
Now usually you can tell whether a
traffic policeman is nice or nasty by
the way he uses his hands. In Sydney
they’re all pretty much the same: real
old pro’s, the lot of them. “I’m new
to Sydney, too,” one told us during a
brief chat after we headed north into a
south-bound avalanche in Pitt Street,
“but I know how to read.” He sounded
as if he meant it.
The other thing you notice about the
police in Sydney probably won’t strike
you at all unless you’ve just entered New
South Wales from Queensland. Those
dark blue uniforms come as a surprise
after the khaki-clad cops of the north.
We can understand why Queenslanders
are intrigued to find a Salvation Army
motor-cyclist on their tail until he reveals
the Force to which he really belongs.
Sydney landlords have a marvellously
inventive list of reasons why they can’t
take you on as flat tenants if you are
afflicted with babies. Only when you
discover it is illegal for them to reject
you on the grounds that you have child-
ren of any age do you realise what all
the evasiveness is about. Elsewhere
Sydneysiders can be charmingly open.
“I shouldn’t try the sole, sir. It’s off
today and I don’t mean off the menu,
either,” a George Street restaurant’s
waiter told us.
Dedication
TTncrowned white queen of Kauai Is-
land, Hawaii Miss Grace Buscher
was dispensing rum punches and leis
of purple orchids to every travel agent
on hand when we arrived at her Hawaiian
luncheon at Sydney’s Menzies Hotel last
week. It has been more than a year
since we last dropped in at Miss Buscher’s
lush, lavish Kauai resort hotel, Coco
Palms, but we noticed that she hasn’t
changed much. Petite, ash-blonde, forty-
ish and friendly, she was wearing a simi-
lar, royal blue muu-muu and the same
ecstatic smile. “Aloh-OH-ha!” she mur-
mured in authentic, 9th-State style. “I
am in Australia,” she added, between
pineapple nibbles, “to promote and en-
courage inter-island intercourse. That is,
travel between our island and yours. And
what a big island this Australia is! I am
staggered by all this expanse and sun-
shine. I know that our Kauaians will
thrill to this area of the South Pacific
just as you all will thrill to our new,
genuine delights and pleasures.”
Later Miss Buscher announced that a
stop-over hotel is soon to be built in
Honolulu “just opposite Qantas” with
Australian holiday budgets in mind. “The
rate for superb double rooms will be a
flat ten dollars a day only five dollars
a head,” she said. Miss Buscher then sang
what was estimated to be her 7385th ren-
dition of the Hawaiian Farewell. Assisting
her was petite, ash-blonde, twenty-ish
and friendly Miss Karen King, a white
Hawaiian who has found time to become
expert at the hula. “Her Daddy, Dick
King, is the vice-president of Aloha Air-
lines. Karen is very dedicated about it
all. You have to be in this business,”
Miss Buscher explained.


Raising the Roof
A note from a Mildura correspondent
tells us that ratepayers there are
beginning to wonder whether their new
cultural centre programme will develop
into an opera house scandal in minia-
ture. Already estimates have risen
£40,000. Since fund-raising began in
1962, the project has met with opposi-
tion at every stage. Local people say
their city is not ready for a new and
enlarged art gallery and little theatre.
A professional fund-raising organisa-
tion was engaged in 1962 to raise
£75,000 from the Mildura public
towards the £120,000 project. An ela-
borate system of personal visits and din-
ners could squeeze only £38,000 from
the ratepayers and the fund-raisers took
£BOOO of this in fees. Mildura City
Council had to double its original £40,000
contribution, and the Victorian Govern-
ment came good with £50,000. Council
set the budget ceiling at £120,000 and
called in the architects for detailed plans.
Now the architects have announced
that the estimate has jumped to £160,000.
At a public meeting they intimated that
the exact cost would not be known until
tenders were called, and it could be
even higher.
The Mildura Gallery Society claims
the little theatre plans are inadequate
and too expensive. The society chair-
man, Dr J. M. Blair, said that a more
suitable theatre could be built for
£50,000 less than the present £90,000
estimate.
Willis’s Raft
A ll Tully (pop. 2700) came to stand
and stare. Families entire, whole
clans, babies in arms (and embryo),
gnarled, tanned grand-dads, toddlers,
hobbledehoys, young marrieds, old mar-
rieds, bockety old ducks toiling through
the hot sand on blue-veined feet like
lumps of gorgonzola. The raft lay at
peace. They murmured at each other.
“She’s a queer-looking turn-out, all
right. Like in a sea, the water’d come
right over that thing.” “Dad? Dad ? But
how would it float?” “It floats on those
three big tubes. They’re steel.” “With air
inside?” “Yeah. I think so.”
A girl to her boy: “What’s that thing
up there?” “That’s the crow’s nest.” “I
s’pose he climbed up it occasionally.”
“They reckon it cost him 25,000 dollars.
I’d rather have the money, myself.”
A youth to a companion, squatting on
the sand. “Sixteen months! Month’d be
enough. Two months.” Some young boys
plunged in, swam quickly to the raft.
They swung from the rigging, dived off
the bowsprit.
“He must have a quid.” “Oh, he makes
a lot out of this game. That book of his
on his last trip was sold in 15 languages.
And he’s gonna make another trip when
he’s 80.” “Gee, he must have a time,
with the waves going right over him.”
“I’d be locking myself in the cabin, I
reckon.”
A thin-faced fishing type eyed the craft
narrowly . . . “Beats me. Says he got
through the Reef by ‘good navigation’.
Like hell it was. Luck. Ever been out
there? Look, all you see’s a bit of a rip-
ple. Might be a school of mullet. You
get close, and it’s a bornbie, big as a
house. All over. Miles and miles. Navi-
gation like fun.” He had a box camera.
“May as well go up and take a picture.
I s’pose it’s a famous thing.”

PLAIN ENGLISH
One Lesson from Saigon
Invents last week in South Viet-
nam have shown how false
was the early confidence that the
appointment of General Taylor as
US Ambassador to Saigon or the
bombing of North Vietnam military
installations implied basically new
policies that would revitalise South
Vietnam and soon turn the tide
against the Viet Cong. General
Khan remains in power but one
cannot reasonably expect that the
latest attempted coup will' be the
last. The problems in South Viet-
nam remain unchanged and the
resolution of them no closer.
All that last week seems to have
achieved was a revival of interest in
the policy of neutralisation which,
as the Laotian case shows, merely
means abandoning the country to
the Communists. We may even ex-
pect soon to hear recommendations
that Cambodia, Burma and Thai-
land be also included in a “neutral-
ised” bloc to be annexed by the
Communists whenever they judge
the time suitable.
The problem of how to revitalise
a country like South Vietnam with
its inferior army, demoralised in-
telligentsia, warring religious fac-
tions and persecuted peasantry is
plainly one to which only the fool-
hardy offer ready solutions. But
although his name is associated with
the overthrow of the Diem regime
(which in perspective may yet be
seen as a fatal disaster) Mr Roger
Hilsman, the former US Assistant
Secretary for the Far East, did out-
line what is still agreed to be the
necessary policy, while he was in
Australia early this year.
America and its allies, despite
their suffering and losses, now are
committed to the idea of an
“Immaculate War” to the
use of a strictly limited number of
expert foreign soldiers and airmen
supporting a conventional local
army of 500,000 men. But since on
the conservative assumption that
one terrorist guerrilla can hold
down at least ten conventional sol-
diers, South Vietnam would need
another 500,000 soldiers to defeat
the 100,000 Congs. It is, in other
words, fighting a losing war which
leaves the countryside in the terro-
rists’ hands. Hilsman advocated (as
well as many political measures)
the use of a large range of un-
conventional, constantly roving
counter-insurgency units operating
by day and night to reopen the
main roads, to mount ambushes in
the back tracks, and to clear and
hold terrorist territory.
Yet such a policy requires, if not
a massive at least a much heavier
commitment of American troops.
The US Army, however, in the light
of its experience in the Korean War,
is opposed to heavy commitments
on the Asian mainland unless it is
permitted to win which may
mean the terrible decision to escal-
ate the war, a policy which has been
rejected by the US Government.
This problem remains today as
it has for some years, and no change
of Ambassador or occasional local
victory can make much difference.
Only America is strong enough to
defeat the terrorists but America is
still unwilling to run the awful risk.
Of all the options open to it
negotiation, withdrawal, escalation,
and continuation of a confined war
it remains completely committed
to the last, even though this, despite
a few minor victories, seems to
mean ultimate defeat. In due
course, one fears, we will find in-
creasing numbers of Americans will
“discover” that some sort of
negotiation or neutralisation may
“make sense”.
However grave would be the loss
of South Vietnam, America could
still consider itself impregnable
while it has bases in, say, Okinawa.
Whatever interpretation Am-
ericans may put on such a develop-
ment, Australians can have
no illusions. The late Mr J. F.
Dulles’s “domino effect” would al-
most certainly result and the Com-
munist empire would, after win-
ning South Vietnam, quickly en-
gulf the rest of South East Asia.
Australia may not have much in-
fluence on American policy, but
the lesson for Australia in South
Vietnam and our need for powerful
independent defences are plain to
see.
ITne can impartially criticise both
the Government and the ACTU
over aspects of their handling of
some of the recent Communist in-
dustrial troubles on Garden Island.
One of the striking unions violated
ACTU policy by its strike, but the
ACTU did nothing to discipline it,
let alone to expel it.
On the other hand the Govern-
ment did not follow the advice it
has readily given others and take
the union to court to seek penalties
any more than it has done in
Victoria when faced with similar
strikes in defence establishments.
It is some small consolation that
the Minister for Labor, Mr W. Mc-
Mahon, has announced that the
Government is at last giving the
“most careful scrutiny” to Com-
munists employed in Common-
wealth defence establishments such
The Garden Islanders
as Garden Island. But the fact re-
mains that they should not be there
at all, nor in any defence establish-
ment. (See story page 21.)
The long-range solution is either
a thorough screening of all em-
ployees under a policy of excluding
Communists, or, as The Bulletin
has suggested in the past, the com-
plete navalisation of the work force.
It is not an easy matter to raise
such a skilled workforce and in
any case one would sympathise
with non-Communist unionists who
might resent a move of that kind.
In that case the onus is on them to
purge their unions of Communist
leadership and in such a cam-
paign they are entitled to expect
far more support and understand-
ing than they appear to get either
from the Government or the
ACTU.

John Robertson, former comman-
der of the aircraft-carrier Mel-
bourne, talked with The Bulletin about
fear, blame, duty, respect, hero-worship,
justice, anger, devotion, his own life
and 82 sailors’ deaths. In a moment of
relaxation, we turned to lighter things.
Among them: an explanation for his pet
name for his softly-spoken English wife,
Helena, who was about to leave us
alone. “Pops?” he laughed, “well, it's
short for Popsie. I used to address her
by the unabridged version when she was
younger, I recall.” Mrs Robertson, who
then was standing at his elbow, smiled.
She is the nice girl who loved her sailor
for three years before they married on
a weekend leave pass in England during
the war. Now she blew a quick kiss and,
late for an evening wedding, fastened a
scarf around her head before running
out the front gate “just to see the bride
leave the church.”
Captain Robertson remained behind in
their two-storey Sydney home at Neutral
Bay. With him were his 16-year-old
daughter, Sadie, and youngest son, Quen-
tin, 10, both home from school. The two
other Robertson boys, Malcolm, 19, and
Brian, 13, are in Victoria. Malcolm, the
captain told us, is named after HMS
Malcolm, the first destroyer he served
on as signal officer for the 16th Des-
troyer Flotilla in the English Channel, the
Western Approaches, at Dover and Har-
wich, off the Dutch and Belgian coasts
and at the evacuation of Dunkirk. Mal-
colm, now reading Science at Monash, is
also the first fifth-generation old boy of
Geelong Grammar where Brian is at
present a boarder.
Surrounded by conflicting newspaper
reports of the past week about his
present position and future, Captain
Robertson has maintained a stoic silence
on several facts that vitally concern him.
The Bulletin now is able to state them
fully for the first time as we go to
press. (Emphasis is made here that the
following details have not been con-
firmed, supplied or in any way verified
by Captain Robertson who so far has
refused to comment on them.)
The facts about Captain Robertson’s
resignation, the situation he now finds
himself in and the events that led to it
have been obtained by The Bulletin
independently of him. They are:
• Captain Robertson was notified of
his appointment to Sydney’s shore-based
naval training centre, HMAS Watson, by
a letter from the Naval Board posted the
day before the Royal Commission's find-
ings on the Voyager disaster were tabled
by Sir Robert Menzies in Parliament
four weeks ago, on Wednesday, August
26. He received this letter on Thursday,
the day after the report was tabled. It
stated also that his new posting would
be gazetted officially in the Navy listings
on the following day, Friday, August 28.
• That Friday's listings, however,
appeared without any mention of Cap-
tain Robertson.
• Within days his written reply to
the Naval Board's letter had reached
Canberra. In it he stated that the shore-
based appointment was unacceptable, in
the circumstances, and unless he was re-
instated as commander of HMAS Mel-
bourne he would be forced to resign.
• The following Friday, September
4, his posting to HMAS Watson appear-
ed in the Navy listings, but, having
expected it a week earlier, Captain
Robertson did not look for it. The first
he knew of the official listing having
been published was when a friend who
had seen it phoned him on the following
Tuesday, September 8, to talk to him
about it. Between the day after the
tabling of the Royal Commission's report
and that Tuesday, Captain Robertson
had received no answer from the Naval
Board to his written ultimatum and no
further correspondence about his new
posting.
• The next day he had written his
official resignation and it was handed to
his superior officer, Rear - Admiral
A. W. R. McNicoll. It is couched in
terms that are expected to make banner
headlines if and when it is released to the
Press. (One close professional associate
of Captain Robertson describes it as “a
gloves-off bobby-dazzler”.)
• Captain Robertson’s situation as
The Bulletin goes to press is that he
has resigned and given a statement of his
reasons to the Naval Board but as long
as there is the faintest possibility that the
Board can reverse its decision and return
“I do not believe that Navy
men will talk as openly at a
public inquiry as at one held in
camera
Captain R. J. Robertson
him to HMAS Melbourne he will make
no public comment or attempt even to
guide reporters’ stories, speculations, etc.,
by “helpful hints”.
A statement resolving Captain Robert-
son's present position is expected from
the Navy Minister this week. Until then
the captain is determined not to com-
ment about any of the above details or
sequence of events leading to his almost
certainly leaving the Navy after nearly
35 years’ service which he began, aged
13, at the Royal Australian Naval Col-
lege, Jervis Bay, as a naval cadet in
1930.
Much has been said—and published
—to Captain Robertson’s discredit in the
past few months since HMAS Melbourne
sliced through the destroyer Voyager off
Jervis Bay on the night of March 10
with the loss of 82 lives. Equally, much
has been said —though not always pub-
lished —to his credit. Among praise for
him is other Naval officers’ commenda-
tion of his demeanor since the tragedy.
Smarting under days of unfavorable
publicity during the Commission's hear-
ings, and now infuriated by implied
doubts about the Commission’s findings
on his degree of responsibility, if any,
for the disaster, he has been stunned by
the decision to remove him from com-
mand of HMAS Melbourne. Naval col-
leagues who sympathise with his public
humiliation are quick to add that that
final Naval Board decision is, in their
view, one of the worst aspects of the
Voyager tragedy. “I have received nearly
150 letters, many from fellow officers,”
Captain Robertson said. “Kindly, en-
couraging letters. They have been a
tremendous boost for me. I know, too,


THIS AUSTRALIA
that the junior officers and ratings are
behind me. I don’t mind admitting that
this has pleased me enormously. It
isn’t until the pressure is on that you
become fully aware of this sort of sup-
port and mateship.”
Leaning back in his chair, he placed
a cigarette in his five-inch holder, lit it
with a souvenir, all-weather lighter from
HMAS Melbourne and talked about a
naval captain he once hero-worshipped.
“His name was Tom Halsey. I served
under him on HMS Malcolm. I suppose
he influenced me more than any other
man I’ve known. I certainly admired him
unreservedly. In what way? It’s so hard
to define, isn't it? He was a fine leader of
men, sensible and understanding. He
never lost his temper or shouted. He was
a splendid, tough, nuggety little fellow. I
would have gone through hell and high
water for him.”
PWcept for the “nuggety little fellow”
part, many of Captain Robertson’s
colleagues and men whom he used to
command feel the same about him.
Robertson is a tall man, well over six
feet with a clear eye and an even,
steady voice that he rarely raises. It
was Captain Halsey of the Royal Navy
who twice recommended him for Men-
tions in Despatches, of which he earned
three during the last war. In 1941 Cap-
tain Robertson also was awarded the
Distinguished Service Cross for the usual
citation of “zeal, honesty and dedication
to duty”:
Answering questions about his war
record, he is brief. His own account of
his life takes him little more than seven
minutes to relate. It took continual
questioning to extract this more detailed
account from him.
“I was born in 1916 at Queenscliff,
Victoria. My father, Captain Donald
John Robertson, was a wartime captain
in the Army. After 1914 he got out. He
drowned at sea in a light boat while
sailing from our Queenscliff home across
the bay to Blackrock to visit my grand-
father, Colonel Jack Ernest Robertson,
who was Commanding Officer of the
then Army fort there. They never found
my father’s body.
“Before 1 went to Flinders as a lad 1
spent only a year at Geelong Grammar.
Before that I went to State schools at
Buckley and Winchelsea. At Flinders
there was a fairly quick turnover of in-
structors. I don't think there was much
time to get to know any of them particu-
larly well. I believe in sending my own
sons to State schools before going on to
a public school (Grammar, of course.
It’s a tradition with Robertsons). I think
that’s still the best way to educate them.
Boarding school equips a lad to meet
the world on his own later. After I
graduated from Flinders” (having won
the prize for Seamanship, the Governor-
General’s Cup for Sports and the prize
for a combined course of Physics,
Mathematics and Chemistry), “I joined
HMAS Australia as cadet midshipman.
It was the beginning of a long associa-
tion with Australia for me.”
It was also the beginning of a long
association with the former Admiral
Harold Farncomb, now a Sydney solici-
tor, who acted for Captain Robertson in
the recent Royal Commission hearing.
“After early sea service abroad, a
course at Greenwich and a specialist
course at the RN Signal School, Ports-
mouth, I was appointed to HMS Mal-
colm as signal officer. After Dunkirk I
was transferred to HMAS Napier as
signal officer and later transferred to
the Mediterranean Fleet for the evacua-
tion of Crete, operations off the Syrian
coast, Tobruk ferry runs, a special con-
voy to Malta and operations at Mada-
gascar. Then, before I left England in
’42, I met ‘Pops’ who was an ambulance
driver. While I was back home on the
staff of the Director of Naval Com-
munications in Melbourne, we wrote
regularly to each other. In fact I pro-
posed and she accepted by mail.
“In November, ’44, I was sent to
Manus Island to become flag lieutenant
aboard HMAS Australia after her bridge
had been hit by that Jap suicide plane.
“Between ’44 and ’47 I served in
HMA ships Australia, Shropshire,
Hobart, Bataan and Arunta. There were
the landings at Lingayen Gulf, the
Philippines campaign, Balikpapan, Tara-
kan and the Brunei operations.” (His
third Mention in Despatches was for
Lingayen operations.) “Then, in July,
’47, I found myself back where I had
begun —at Flinders. I was appointed
officer-in-charge of the RAN Signal
School there.”
In September, 1954, came his first sea
command —as skipper of the RAN’s
yachting entry, Tam O’Shanter, in the
Sydney-Hobart race of 1954-55. “I
enjoyed that first command even
though we had no engine. We finished
seventh, by the way.”
In October came his appointment to
HMAS Swan in command on commis-
sioning. “She was an old pre-war sloop,
scrubbed up for cadet training.”
Promotion to captain came in 1956.
After serving as chief staff officer to
the Flag Officer-in-Charge, Eastern Aus-
tralian Area, Naval HQ, Sydney, came
command of HMAS Queenborough and
then HMAS Vendetta. Captain Robert-
son sighed as we asked him about the
now familiar story of Vendetta’s col-
lision with Williamstown Pier.
“It was a straight case of human
error. My order ‘half astern both
engines’ wasn’t carried out. Instead,
Vendetta moved forward at half ahead
both engines. I repeated my original
order four times. Still she continued
forward. There was nothing I could do
to stop Vendetta impaling her bow in
the gate of the dry dock. The only lucky
thing about the whole unfortunate
accident was that her bow didn’t fully
pierce the gates as the frigate Quick-
Captain R. J. Robertson and Mrs Robertson at home. The Robertson
children, from left, are Brian, Malcolm, Sadie and Quentin.

Yet another mighty industry opens up in Western Australia. At Bunbury stands
the huge Laporte chemical plant, built to manufacture Titanium Oxide. In this
where rubber

enormous. Under sub-contract from Bechtel Pacific Corporation Limited,
Dunlop was awarded the job of supplying the protective rubber linings . . .
and chemicals
over 80,000 lbs. of rubber ... the biggest contract of its kind ever to be
awarded to a single company in Australia. Whatever needed protection

alkalis, solvents or gases . . . Dunlop had the answer. Other rubber com-
ponents supplied by Dunlop ranged from suction and delivery hoses,

type of work, whatever the requirements . . . Dunlop products always do the job any job

match was inside and would have been
flooded. After the Naval inquiry that
followed in camera I was sent an
admonitory note and that was the end
of it.”
Captain Robertson is not entirely
correct about that. There was something
more, which he did not mention: after
the inquiry, equipment on destroyers of
similar class to Vendetta was altered
to ensure that an officer in charge on
the bridge could see that his orders were
being executed correctly by the engine-
room.
How does Captain Robertson feel
about a Royal Commission, instead of
a regular Naval inquiry, having been
brought to bear on the Voyager disaster?
“I can say only that obviously a special,
extraordinary inquiry was warranted. I
do not feel that Royal Commissions can
ever substitute effectively for the sort of
naval inquiry that followed a similar
disaster in America afte: the Wasp-
Hudson collision in 1952. That was con-
ducted by three rear-admirals. Un-
fortunately, in Australia we couldn’t
afford to have three of our seven rear-
admirals tied up with ar, inquiry for
possibly months. Without commenting
on the Commission here in any way, I
doubt very much that Navy men will
talk in public to the same extent that
they will at an inquiry held in camera.”
Back at sea in January, 1964, as com-
mander of HMAS Melbourne, Captain
Robertson, then 47, had eight years’
service ahead of him before the retiring
age for RAN captains (55). If his
resignation is accepted, he will forfeit
a £2228 annual pension. What, then, is
he to do to earn a living, maintain his
home and continue to educate his child-
ren? It is understood some overtures
have been made by friends who may be
able to help him find a new job, as yet
indefinite.
The night of February 10 does not
haunt Captain Robertson. “I count my-
self one of the lucky ones,” he said,
after a question about what emotional
effect the tragedy has had on him. “I
don’t get nightmares.” He added that
he knows of some survivors of Voyager
who are still waking from bad dreams.
“I suppose I’ve escaped that mental
torture because I honestly don’t feel
directly involved in what happened. All
the ghastly things that night—the trapped
men screaming as Voyager went down,
the horror, all that terrible loss of life —
none of it hit me half as badly as it
did the poor devils who were also
trapped in Voyager and only just
managed to escape. I was only a spec-
tator, you see. I think it important you
understand me on this. It is the men
who were personally involved in the
horror that my heart goes out to. They
have the worst memories. It was their
mates who went down with her. And
many of them are so young, had never
experienced the nearness of death before
... I had often experienced it during
the war. Dunkirk isn't easy to forget. But
I like to remember only the few funny
parts of Dunkirk. The things that made
you laugh . . .
“Like some of the troops clambering
aboard still carrying saxophones they
had picked up in France. That sort of
thing. A sense of humor helps a lot,
you know.” He could not recall any-
thing funny about the sinking of
Voyager.
“One of the less tragic but depressing
things about the whole disaster for me
was that, although I sent a signal to
Canberra at 8.50 p.m. about what had
just happened, no news of the collision
was released until so many hours later
the next day. I try not to lose my
temper but I knew anger over that. I
still think it disgraceful that the public
weren’t informed immediately what was
happening. Apart from anything else,
it cast an initial blanket of secrecy over
something that needed no masking at all.
It had happened, nothing could be done
to undo it; it should have been told to
the country. The public has a right to
know and not be kept in the dark so
long. Relatives of the poor blokes aboard
Voyager must have gone through their
own private hell when they learned how
late the news was that finally began
leaking through.”
Captain Robertson feels strongly about
the duty of all Services to train per-
sonnel to keep the public informed about
what they are doing. “This vital duty
has been sadly neglected in Australia.
It is only fear that prompts it, I suppose.
Silly fear of wrong exposure or mis-
interpretation. It has always been my
experience that you’ve got nothing to
be frightened of, however, if you’ve
nothing to hide.”
Captain Robertson feels no blame for
the Voyager disaster. None. “I have
searched my mind, gone over and over
what happened. I know I am not to
blame in any way.” Yet blame—or the
suspicion of it has not been lifted
from his shoulders by the findings of
Mr Justice Spicer, the Royal Com-
missioner. “I cannot yet comment on
that. I know only that if I were to
blame I would know it—and I don’t.
“The best that I can say to you,” he
went on, “about this wretched aura of
blame that I know the public must be
as aware of as I am is that you may
imagine how I feel about it.”
Three shelves of a large cupboard at
the Robertson home are laden with
transcripts of the Royal Commission. A
packet of headache pills rests within
easy reach in a pigeonhole in the
Captain's desk. In spite of the Com-
mission’s report and in some cases
because of it the headache persists.
Has justice been done?
“I much prefer others, less involved
than me, to assess that,” said Captain
Robertson, “and also whether justice
appears to have been done.”
It was “Pops” who brought in tea.
The Captain sipped his from a pint-sized
china cup that is inscribed with “The
Sailor’s Farewell”:
Far from home across the sea
to foreign climes 1 go.
While far away O think of me
and I’ll remember you . . .
“My devotion to the Navy and its
men is one thing that will remain un-
affected by all this. Nothing could
change that,” he said.

A debate or a manhunt?
FROM ALAN REID IN CANBERRA
F. CHANEY
Emotional
THhe Government took a bad beating
in the debate on the report of the
Royal Commission which investigated
the sinking of HMAS Voyager. It had
to be beaten, even if only because no
semantics could possibly transform a
collision at sea between two Australian
warships, with appalling loss of life, into
a triumph of Australian arms.
The Prime Minister, Sir Robert
Menzies, had the realistic approach of an
old political campaigner. He recog-
nised that the Government could not
win; so he sought to minimise his losses
politically.
He listed eight reforms which the
RAN proposed to implement immedi-
ately to prevent a recurrence of such a
tragedy or to reduce the loss of life in
the case of future Naval accidents that

involved a sinking. He also announced
a ministerial committee to “closely and
regularly consider ways and means of
reviewing Naval organisation procedures
and methods so as to make improve-
ments where these are found to be
desirable”.
From a political viewpoint it was a
workmanlike job. From an administra-
tive viewpoint it had, in my view, serious
flaws. Menzies revealed very clearly his
own basic uneasiness about RAN ad-
ministration and (though the Opposition
as yet does not seem to have realised
this) was by implication even more
critical than any Opposition speaker.
He said: “We also believe that there
may be doubts not capable of precise
definition as to the effectiveness of the
Naval organisation, including communi-
cation procedures, and as to the suit-
ability of methods of selection training
and promotion so far practised.”
But for some reason, having said that
and thereby having justified a major re-
organisation, Menzies boggled about
bringing in a new broom or brooms.
Mr Sam Benson (Lab., Vic.), an
Atlantic war convoy veteran and RAN
corvette commander, who followed Men-
zies, contributed a thoughtful, balanced
speech which simultaneously revealed
his commonsense and deep feeling for
the Navy, in whose reserve he served for
30 years in war and peace.
Benson impressed the House of Rep-
resentatives and also revealed consider-
able humanity in sympathising with Sub-
Lieutenant Bate who, with comparatively
brief seagoing experience, had been ap-
pointed senior officer of the watch of
the 29,000-ton aircraft carrier.
With telling simplicity, Benson said:
“These circumstances (of a compara-
tively inexperienced officer being senior
officer of the watch) do not obtain in
the merchant navy, although after four
years at sea a person may obtain a
Second Mate’s Certificate and therefore
be eligible to act as second officer of
a foreign-going ship of any size.
“It is not until two more certificates
the First Mate's Foreign-Going Cer-
tificate and a Master’s Foreign-Going
Certificate have been obtained that
as far as watch-keeping is
concerned is given serious thought.
“For instance, quite a number of
shipping companies demand that where
passengers are carried (these presumably
would be ships moving up towards Mel-
bourne’s 29,000 tons) all watch-keeping
officers must be holders of a Master’s
Foreign-Going Certificate.”
Benson made it clear that the situation
of Bate being senior officer of the watch
on the fatal night was not Bate’s fault...
“it is the fault of the organisation which
creates such standards, whereby people
are expected to do a job without proper
training.”
Navy Minister Chaney did his
political reputation considerable harm in
replying to Benson. Where Benson had
been calm, he was emotional.
Labor Minister William McMahon
retrieved the situation for the Govern-
ment by taking the attitude that Chaney
should have taken by acknowledging
Benson s sincerity and by saying that he
had proffered views that merited serious
consideration.
Benson's emphasis on this point re-
minded me of the uneasiness with which
I had left a Press conference with
Minister J. Forbes, then Acting Navy
Minister, and Chaney, then Navy
Minister designate, which was attended
by Chief of the Naval Staff Admiral Sir
Hastings Harrington shortly after the
Voyager sinking.
At this conference when it became
clear understandably that those being
interrogated had no precise knowledge
of what had happened on the Voyager
and Melbourne, I switched to asking
what should have been the position:
“What did Naval regulations specify
should be the strength of the bridge-
keeping force when undertaking an
operation of such a nature?”
I left that conference with the feeling
that either Naval regulations covering
such things did not exist, or that if
they did exist precise knowledge of their
form and requirements was not held to
be an essential part of the equipment of
the Navy’s higher echelons. Instead of
dealing with Naval administration, the
Opposition switched off on to the issue
on whether or not a man or men should
be court-martialled, starting what Men-
zies could justifiably describe as “a man-
hunt”.
This put Menzies and his Govern-
ment in a position of defending some-
thing which they could legitimately
defend, and took the spotlight off the
much larger issue that Menzies had
pointed up in his own speech the
effectiveness of Naval organisation.
COMMUNISTS
The Strikes at
Garden Island
The present situation is insanity
FROM A SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
W. McMAHON
“ Scrutiny”
HPhe recent trouble at Garden Island
highlights a vulnerability beside which
any other weaknesses that the Navy may
have are of minor importance. The
stark truth is that our warships are pre-
pared for sea by a civilian workforce
which is to a substantial extent under
Communist leadership. The Minister for
Labor, Mr W. McMahon, said the Gov-
ernment now has the matter under
“scrutiny”.
Most of the disputes are silly and
petty. Take, for example, the two most
recent stoppages. Deeply involved in
both was a Mr Taylor, a crane driver,
who is also the delegate on “the Island”
of the Federated Engineers and Fire-
men’s Association. A month ago he
and six other crane-drivers walked off
the wharf because they claimed that
shipwrights were doing work that should
properly be done by their union (al-
though the shipwrights had been doing it
for months without any objections being
made). The management therefore
“marked the cards” of the seven men, a
mild penalty of which the significance
is that a certain number of these marks
add up to liability to dismissal. The
ensuing stoppage was settled as usual by
a face-saving formula, which promised
removal of the marks after three months
on condition that the union reaffirmed,
and the men observed, the existing rule
about not walking off the job in the
case of demarcation disputes without first
consulting the management.
This agreement was broken last week.
The indefatigable Mr Taylor was re-
quested to lift a load from a ship to a
private contractor’s truck. He bethought
himself to inquire whether the truck
driver was “a union man”, and on being
told that this was no concern of his, he
walked off. The management refused
to allow him to call a meeting of his
members and the transport workers. That
meeting, if it had been held, might have
established the fact that the truck driver
was a member of the Electrical Trades
Union; but to have allowed it would have
been to admit the principle that Garden
Island delegates should police the many
private employees who have occasion to
visit the dockyard. That would indeed
have opened the way for bigger, better
and more frequent stoppages. Mr

The origins of these disputes illustrate
the very trivial nature of the issues and
the deliberate misunderstandings that
are used as pretexts for strikes. Normally
such strikes are quickly settled, in which
case the men are delighted. They may
have lost a day’s pay or more, but they
will more than make this up in the
following few days by the overtime that
is then necessary in order to recapture
the lost schedule.
The present management of the island
has striven hard to introduce greater
discipline and a more rational procedure
for dealing with complaints. Some
success has been achieved and some of
the local delegates are not now quite
the heroes that a series of small vic-
tories had formerly made them.
This kind of improvement, however,
is not enough. A new dispute or a new
pretext can be whipped up at any time.
In taking a firm line the management
suffers from the in-built disadvantage
that there is always a deadline to be met,
the sailing date. Troubles will occur
until the labor force is purged of Com-
munists and professional agitators.
This could be done in one of two
ways. The Navy could have its own
dock labor —but then how could it find
the technical men of whom it is already
desperately short? The other way is to
“screen” those who apply for work at
Garden Island.
Most people will be astonished to
learn that this is not done already. The
theory is that as the Communist Party,
by the wish of the people, remains a
legal organisation, its members should
not be banned from defence establish-
ments. So the extraordinary anomaly
arises, that whereas applicants to, say, the
Department of External Affairs, are care-
fully screened, a self-confessed Com-
munist can get a job at the dockyard.
The anomaly is the more idiotic when
one considers the comparative difficulty
of being an effective traitor in an Ex-
ternal Affairs post: one needs not only
fanaticism, but also elaborate apparatus,
cameras and transmitters, the skill to use
them, and contacts with the potential
enemy. A Communist at Garden
Island needs none of these. He only
needs the will literally to throw a span-
ner in the works, or to join with his
fellows in preventing a ship from going
to sea.
Let the Government face this squarely.
Defence establishments such as Garden
Island should be “classified” for security:
not only as to certain tasks or parts of
them, but the whole establishment, and
only “screened” workers should be
allowed to work there. The outcome of
the recent strike must not blind us to
the fact tihat the present situation is
sheer insanity.

THE ALP
Dr Cairns Takes Over
The fixers fail again
FROM A SYDNEY CORRESPONDENT
C. OLIVER
Certification
TAr Jim Cairns is now firmly in con-
trol of the Victorian ALP Executive
and has killed off the earlier plans of
Victorian President Mr Bob Holt, NSW
President Charlie Oliver and Federal
President Jim Keeffe for a deal between
the Right wing and the Left wing whereby
Victoria would not raise trouble about
the NSW Government’s vote - catching
plans for State Aid to private schools,
and in return NSW would not object to
the Leftist participation in the coming
Communist-front Peace Congress or to
Victorian Unity Tickets. There was even
hope, before the Cairns takeover, that
Keeffe, Oliver and Holt would get “the
numbers” to win control of the Federal
Executive from Party boss “Joe” Cham-
berlain and the Left.
The Party image would also have been
improved by accepting Oliver’s plan
to certify ALP candidates against Com-
munists in union elections, and even if
this were not done in Victoria, Holt
was to do what he could for a better
line there on Unity Tickets. On State
Aid, more realistic policies than Cham-
berlain’s consistent “No” would be also
tried.
The Left wing in Victoria did not
take long to torpedo the plan. Holt’s
plea for at least a show of inquiry into
the Unity Ticket of ALP men and Com-
munists in the 1964 Waterside Workers’
election was flatly rejected by the State
Executive and he walked out, vowing
not to return until he got his way. Un-
moved, the Left suggested Vice-President
Ron Alsop could take over. Holt re-
turned and has appealed the Unity Ticket
to the Federal Executive. The Left is
still unmoved. It will have “the numbers”
there.
The new chief, Dr Cairns, summed up
the Victorian Executive attitude: He said
there were more important matters than
Unity Tickets, which was a minor issue.
Cairns is now in an unassailable po-
sition on the Victorian Executive and
the Party leader, Arthur Calwell, as a
State Executive member, will be subject
to majority decisions of the Cairns-
controlled Executive.
Victorian Federal Parliamentarians
know that selection for their seats de-
pends on being onside with the State
Executive and Dr Cairns. The State
Secretary, Bill Hartley, backs Dr Cairns,
not Holt. He is also a link with Chamber-
lain to whose influence Hartley owed
his appointment (Post Office revenue
has been boosted by trunk calls between
Perth Trades Hall and Melbourne
Trades Hall in recent months) and Vic-
toria will follow the Cairns-Chamber-
lain line, not the Holt line.
Apart from Holt, it is questionable
whether Keeffe could have delivered the
goods in Queensland. The Left, which
took over at the Bundaberg conference,
is organising to retain power at next
year’s Townsville conference of Queens-
land Labor. It is seeking ruthlessly to
cut down Right-wing delegations and
claims success is certain. Superior Left-
wing organising ability backs their
claim.
Keeffe will be elected to the Senate
next election and his influence will
dwindle once he is no longer State Sec-
retary. Election of a Left-wing pro-
Chamberlain State Secretary looks likely
as Keeffe’s replacement, and that will
mean the end of Right-wing hopes of
Queensland support.
In these circumstances Oliver and
NSW Secretary Colborne as NSW re-
presentatives could be lonely figures at
ALP Federal Executive meetings. Cer-
tainly there now seems little hope of en-
dorsement of the Oliver plan for certifi-
cation of ALP candidates in union elec-
tions or of Renshaw proposals for limited
State Aid both regarded as vital to
ensure re-election of the NSW Labor
Government. Chamberlain in a report to
the WA State Executive accused NSW
Labor of “irrational behavior border-
ing on hysteria following the Federal
election defeat,” and is unlikely to make
life easier for NSW, regularly described
by his supporters as the “Grouper” State.
Left-wing determination is proved by
Chamberlain’s call for “No State Aid
without a referendum” (which means
no State Aid ever) and Victoria’s firm
statement that no Labor Party branch
can support State Aid. Few Labor men
doubt that these statements are the
answer to publicity about the possible
Keeffe-Oliver-Holt tie-up.
The fact is the ALP Left is not inter-
ested in winning elections by fighting
Communism in the unions or by com-
promising on State Aid. The Left is
interested in the Party machine, which
it has controlled since the 1954 split and
means to continue to control. Almost
its only concession to the Parliamenta-
rians has been to agree to put off the
1965 Federal ALP Conference to August
of that year, when the NSW and SA
elections will be over and Federal Left-
wing dominance at the conference can-
not damage Labor prospects.
Left - wingers discount suggestions
that NSW may defy Chamberlain on his
unions’ plan and State Aid. Whatever his
personal determination, they expect his
Executive to conform as it has always
conformed.
So the fixers, who since 1954 have
been trying to get unity without tears,
seem to have failed again. The ALP re-
mains dominated by a Left wing, whose
decisions and policies are massive vote-
losers, while the Right-wing continues
to vainly seek to mix oil and water
to form a united Party from Left and
Right elements, whose fundamental
policies are entirely irreconcilable.

Western Australia’s crayfishing indus-
try depends for its profitability on the
full utilisation of its equipment during
the fishing season and freedom from
maintenance in any season. Its boats
need to be free from corrosion. That’s
why Engineer and Marine Services
Pty. Ltd. used high-strength aluminium
marine alloys in building the “Lady of
Fatima” for De Sousa & Company.
Of all-welded aluminium construc-
tion, “Lady of Fatima” has been
champion boat on both fish and cray-
fish every year since 1959. The boat is
a self-contained unit and crayfish and
prawns are caught, processed, flash-
frozen and packaged on board. Alu-
minium ensures essential cleanliness,
because there’s no rust to stain goods
or equipment. Draught is reduced and
docking is easier. Maintenance costs
are slashed.
Of course, there’s more to achieve-
ment than aluminium alone. Achieve-
ment also means Australuco’s years of
experience in research, testing, design
and improved alloys . . . years of prac-
tical application which can be summed
up in two words: know-how. So, when
you add technical skill and expertise
to aluminium’s inherent qualities,
achievement is the natural result.
Australuco’s engineers and techni-
cians, backed by the world - wide
experience and knowledge of the
Alcan Group, are able to supply the
latest information about the many
applications of aluminium in all phases
of Australian industry.

BUSINESS
Korman’s Goose
Cooked before the credit squeeze
FROM J. C. HORSFALL IN MELBOURNE
TI/Ir Stanley Korman’s hopes that he
will yet save other public companies
besides Factors Limited in his battered
empire, were dealt a stunning blow, at
least in the case of Stanhill Development
Finance Limited, by the Interim Report
of the Official Investigator, Mr Peter
Murphy QC, tabled in the Victorian
Parliament last week.
From a Report studded with allega-
tions, it transpires that SDF was used
very much in the same fashion as
Reid Murray Acceptance to channel
money into other companies of a group
blinded by grandiose development hori-
zons.
In pointing the main bone at Stanley
Korman himself (on the admission of
fellow directors to the Investigator he
was both master mind and virtual dic-
tator of Board decisions) the Report
rummages among a maze of transactions
which followed the successful flotation
of SDF in the head boom days of mid-
-1960. By the end of that year SDF had
loaned to other group companies, includ-
ing some Korman “family” proprietaries,
the whole of the £2l million of its initial
issues of shares and unsecured notes
without any adequate security and in
December 1960 was unable to find even
a sum of £16,000 owing for stamp duties.
Equally fantastic is the finding that, after
having stated in the SDF prospectus
that it would subscribe for £250,000 of
its new shares, Stanhill Consolidated
(the key company in the group with
Stanley Korman as chairman) borrowed
the money from SDF after the issue to
do so. Mr Murphy has some damning
thoughts about that.
All this happened before the credit
squeeze, which the Investigator entirely
rules out as the cause of SDF’s insol-
vency. This is despite Mr Korman’s
continued insistence that because it
frightened off the Hilton (US) people’s
proposed investment of several millions
in the group, the credit squeeze was the
cause of all his troubles. But if the goose
was cooked before the 1960 credit
squeeze, Mr Murphy makes it perfectly
plain that what he calls a “round robin”
swapping of cheques between various
companies in the group in February,
1961, saved a very good helping for the
Korman family interests.
The Investigator has not yet spoken
his own last word, but he does indeed
seem to be getting to the root of things.
SPORT
“Amateur” Snobbery
Harry Hopman and “Saturday tennis"
By DISCUS
TTarry Hopman drove one of the final
nails into amateur tennis recently
when he condemned Europe’s “Saturday
tennis” players. These ladies and gentle-
men are mostly people of fair position
or wealth who play tennis, in contrast
to people who play tennis to gain position
or wealth. They are amateurs and they
play an amateur game, and as H. H. has
indicated, there is no place for them in
Davis Cup tennis.
The Cup and most of the world’s
tournaments belong to the people who are
subsidised to play all year around the
world, and this classification does not
include the present top Americans, who
are university students. It is a class in
which Australia is alone, and may easily
remain alone, until open tennis is ac-
cepted in most countries, or Australians’
interest in the game withers.
Open tennis, or open anything, suggests
tournaments in which both amateurs and
professionals compete. This is a nice
theory. In practice it is ages since the
last amateur won any event open to pro-
fessionals. The supporters of amateur
tennis will block open tournaments for
as long as possible, which will not be so
very long if the Australian supremacy
continues to the point of boredom.
Strangely but logically, the strongest
supporter of “Saturday tennis” in other
countries is Australia.
The professional tennis which exists
now is such a grind that few amateurs
fancy it. They can make almost as much
money and retain their “amateur” status,
which is a considerable asset in the com-
mercial world, when they retire. In con-
trast, who hears of Sedgman, Hoad,
Rosewall, Rose or Laver now? Because
there are no Opens, tennis professionals
are lepers compared to the golf pros
whose Opens are played on the best
courses in the world, while professional
tennis remains on the outer.
This is a strange kind of snobbery,
and one the sporting world could do
without. There was a time when “ama-
teur” meant something which was fine
but tends to be ridiculous now.


Baxter’s University
The Crown Prince and the God-Professors
By MACQUARIE
The days have gone when getting a
piece about a university into the
papers was harder than getting a
government grant. Government grants
today form the major part of the newer
universities’ incomes (often 80 per cent
or more) and the public has begun to
take a keen interest in what happens to
its money. Ivory towers are no longer
places of comfortable obscurity—despite
a few dusty corners and some notable
skeletons hidden away.
The University of New South Wales
has had a large share of this attention.
Partly because it is young, partly because
of the character of two men —“Wally"’
Wurth and Professor J. P. Baxter.
Wurth, the almost legendary figure
who controlled the public service of
NSW for more than a quarter of a cen-
tury, was the University’s first Chancel-
lor from 1949 to his death in 1959. He
was a controversial figure—an extra-
ordinarily widely experienced adminis-
trator and a man with a rare capacity for
attracting loyalty from those about him.
He was no academic, but he was an
honors graduate in law and a very skil-
ful politician. When it came to organi-
sing, employing staff, obtaining finance,
getting sites and buildings onto them, and
arranging legislation he had no peers.
Within six months of the setting up of a
Developmental Council he had his first
students. Sixteen months later the uni-
versity was a reality.
Because of his public service back-
ground, he was unacceptable to some.
Because he was an admitted autocrat, he
was unpopular with others. Chancellors
are supposed to be quiet, gentlemanly
types who interfere very little with the
detail of running a university. Wurth
was quiet and shy of publicity, but he
had a hand in everything. He was im-
patient of what he thought was nonsense,
and came up against many an academic
who was claiming, in the name of acade-
mic freedom, what Wurth thought was
academic licence. Above everything, he
believed that a governing body should
govern.
Oaxter is very different. He is acade-
■""* mically distinguished but personally
rather cold. It is rare to hear anyone
express personal liking for him, and he
has none of Wurth’s ability to inspire
any sort of faith among his colleagues.
In some ways, though, he has done
better. He, too, is occasionally accused
of being “too public-service minded”, but
this sort of thing is usually said of the
administration in general rather than of
him personally. He is no public-service
bureaucrat, but he is a bureaucrat
nevertheless. He was a research director
in England with ICI, a company that is
larger and more complex than the public
services of many Australian States. He
is an efficient administrator, a distin-
guished-looking man, a very effective
speaker and a most successful fund-
raiser. These are all valuable qualities
in a Vice-Chancellor.
One thing he does share with Wurth.
He is not afraid to try something just
because it is not yet “respectable”
academically. As a result, his university
includes schools that are rare or non-
existent in other Australian universities —
textile technology, wool technology,
sociology, nuclear engineering, hospital
administration, librarianship and business
administration. It also has 10.000 stu-
dents and £lO million worth of buildings
after only 15 years—comparable to Syd-
ney University after more than a century.
Like Wurth, he is called an autocrat.
His critics say that his rule is foreign to
the traditional idea of a university as a
“self-governing community of scholars”.
Few graduates and even fewer of the
public would know what this is about.
Most students are merely talked at by
their lecturers, scarcely ever meet their
professors and certainly would not know
anyone above professorial level. And
typically they couldn't care less.
Just what is the set-up in a university?
New South Wales is not typical
each Australian university has important
differences. But they all are statutory
bodies —legislative relatives of such
earthy bodies as the Milk Board and the
Metropolitan Water, Sewerage and
Drainage Board. Since they were all set
up by acts of parliament and are paid
from the public purse, all their staffs are
public servants —whether they care for
the name or not.
At the University of New South Wales
the top body is the Council. Together

OWNED AND CONTROLLED BY AUSTRALIANS FOR AUSTRALIANS


with the graduates, the undergraduates
and “such professors, other persons
giving instruction, and superior officers
as may be prescribed” the Council is the
“university”.
It has up to 40 members, five repre-
senting the professions, five industry and
commerce, three the trade union move-
ment, and two “agricultural, pastoral and
rural interests”. Altogether a majority—
twenty-four —can be drawn from outside
academic life. However, only seven are
at present non-graduates. Staff and stu-
dents elect up to fourteen members and
the remaining two are the Vice-Chancel-
lor and a representative of the Senate of
the University of Sydney.
Inside the university the Council is
king. It authorises courses, appoints
staff and has “entire control of the
management of the affairs, concerns and
property of the university”. From its
number it elects a Chancellor and
Deputy Chancellor for two-year terms,
but these gentlemen normally do not play
a vital role in the affairs of the university.
Baxter, as Vice-Chancellor, is the
crown prince. He is the chief executive
officer, the man who carries out the
Council’s decisions. His term of office
does not appear in the Act, the regula-
tions or the by-laws. It is rumored that
the terms of his appointment are in a
contract. But his powers are public
knowledge. He is automatically a
member of every board, faculty and com-
mittee, and can preside if he wishes. He
has a brief “to manage and supervise the
administrative, financial and other acti-
vities of the university”; to consult with
and advise all boards, faculties, commit-
tees, professors and heads of depart-
ments; to exercise discipline; and to exe-
cute Council decisions. It is very hard
to see what he cannot do. He is like the
managing director of a large private
business and can certainly be autocratic
if he wishes.
From the diagram, it will be obvious
just how powerful the Vice-Chancellor
is. Technically the Professorial Board
reports to the Council or the Vice-
Chancellor but, in practice, there is no
doubt that it is Baxter’s influence that
counts. Moreover, it is unlikely that
this will change.
Below Baxter, the line splits into exe-
cutive and academic. On the executive
side he has two Pro-Vice-Chancellors
(Professors Myers and Clark) who look
after finance, personnel and some par-
ticular parts of the university. But a
great deal goes directly to Baxter. The
most important non-academics are the
Bursar, one-time a senior officer in Tech-
nical Education, and the Registrar, also
ex-Technical Education. The Bursar
handles finance, personnel, buildings and
purchasing. The Registrar looks after
the enrolment of students, their progress
through the university and the eventual
granting of their degrees, if they last the
distance.
The Pro-Vice-Chancellors, both ener-
getic and very capable, obviously have
considerable power, because of their
positions and because they are techni-
cally candidates for Baxter’s job. How-
ever, each is the head of a school and
there is inevitably a conflict between
what they must do in their schools and
what they need to do as Pro-Vice-
Chancellors.
A Sore Point
university is divided into seven
A faculties (applied science, architecture,
arts, commerce, engineering, medicine
and science). Each of these contains one
or a number of schools handling particu-
lar subject areas. A Dean is appointed
for each faculty by the Council and is
responsible to the Vice-Chancellor. This
is a particularly sore point with the aca-
demics, many of whom feel that they
should be elected by their faculties and
be responsible to them as they are in
many universities. They have academic
responsibilities but also have substantial
executive power. They are responsible
for financial and staffing estimates and
for approving expenditure beyond cer-
tain limits—roughly for anything costing
more than £IOO.
The senior academic body is the Pro-
fessorial Board, which comprises pro-
fessors and others appointed by the
Council (always of professorial status).
The Registrar (ex officio) is its secretary
and it elects a chairman every two years
who thus becomes a member of the
Council. It reports to the Council and
the Vice-Chancellor on academic policy
and represents a pretty formidable body
to the head of a school who puts a pro-
position before it. Many a brain-child
that looked to be bursting with health in
the quiet of the study, displays signs of
serious illness when forty highly critical
professors start to take it to pieces. It is
a chastening experience and many will
admit that the most difficult task they can
face is to steer a controversial proposal
through the Board.
The faculties comprise all professors,
associate professors and senior lecturers
in the relevant areas plus, in some cases,
lecturers (commerce and architecture) or
a proportion of lecturers (arts). They
supervise teaching, conduct examinations,
and encourage scholarship and research,
in theory, but often, in practice they are
concerned with the more formal parts of
these activities. The real action is in the
schools and in the Professorial Board.
The professors are the contact between
the students and staff and the higher
echelons. To most students and to many
of the staff, they are the administration.
If you’re lucky and your professor
believes in involving his staff (and
students), a university can be a wonder-
ful place to work. It is hard to imagine
any other occupation that will give quite
junior people the same range of indepen-
dence, or allow them to work with others
of such high calibre. Having your
opinion really count at 23 —or even 33 —
is tremendously satisfying and helps to
explain the attraction of universities.
But not all schools are like this. Many
professors display a marked reluctance
to accord their staffs the voice in manage-
ment of their schools that they claim as
a right from their own governing bodies.
In Britain, this problem was one of the
central concerns of the most recent
report on universities —the Robbins
Report. In Chapter XV, it said: “We
were told that in some universities all the
important decisions about general aca-
demic policy rest in the hands of bodies
composed predominantly of professors.

Wales and Scotland, professors out-
number other academic staff on the
Senate in all cases where we have infor-
mation, and often by five or even ten
to one. Both on questions of major
policy and in the more intimate running
of faculties and departments, the non-
professorial members of the staff of such
universities are said to feel that they have
an inadequate share in determining the
evaluation of the society of which they
are members.
They certainly feel this way in Austra-
lia. Alarmed by the tendency for new
universities to be organised in the same
manner as older ones, the Federation of
Australian University Staff Associations
prepared a carefully constructed docu-
ment entitled “Academic Structure and
Government in a New University” which
they sent to the Interim Council for
Macquarie University (Macquarie is to
be the fourth university in New South
Wales). This is a most informative
document for those interested in univer-
sities. In it they said: “One obvious re-
form would be a governing body with a
much higher proportion of members
elected by the staff as a whole. Another
would be to separate the functions of
teaching and administration far more
than they are now separated. The con-
centration of these matters in the hands
of departmental heads is a basic factor in
reducing the level of democracy which
should be attainable within the univer-
sity, and in the cases of departmental
heads with little interest in or aptitude
for administration, it can be an im-
portant obstacle to efficiency.”
Democracy has to commence at grass-
roots level where the epithet “God-
Professors” is too common to be a joke.
It is sobering to think that many univer-
sities overseas manage to do without
Professorial Boards altogether and that
perhaps the first desirable reform is the
dilution of their omnipotent powers in
matters academic.
Perhaps, too, when professors start to
consult their own staffs more frequently
and press for including all staff in facul-
ties instead of the senior ones only, they
will get a better reception for their own
ideas on democracy. An oligarchy is
difficult to distinguish from an autocracy
for those underneath.


No Road For
Lady May
“ Safari ” is a ludicrous misnomer
By DAVID McNICOLL
If you have never been to Coen, you
should not worry unduly. It is more
of a last resort than a resort. But
when the traveller in the far-northern
Cape comes to a hilltop after a tortured,
bone-shaking, dust-clogged drive through
hundreds of miles of stunted gumtree
sameness, the sight of Coen is a won-
drous sight indeed. The Adam’s
apple moves grittily up and down in
anticipation of a chilled beer. And as
you turn up into the tiny collection of
tin-roofed houses and sheds you feel an
affinity with the wandering Arab, finally
come to an oasis.
Coen? Well, we happened to be in
Coen because it was on our route to the
top of the Cape. As baggage-master I
had driven our camping gear and guns
to Townsville, and there been joined
by my friend Snow and our two sons.
In Townsville we picked up a Nissan
Patrol, one of the incredibly hardy
Japanese four-wheel-drive vehicles, trans-
ferred our gear and set off on the long
haul north. The Nissan gave us good
speeds and about 17 miles to the gallon.
We calculated that we would not need to
start carrying extra petrol until we left.
Coen—it varied in price from a high of
6s. 6d. a gallon down to 3s. a gallon
which the Comalco Company charged
at Weipa. Throughout the trip we car-
ried plenty of water —in the dry season
90 per cent of the creeks are dry, the
rivers are very low—and the distances
between water are very, very long.
Australia, as far as countryside and
fauna is concerned, is, if we are truthful,
a sad disappointment. We delude our-
selves that it is a country of variety, of
striking contrast. But this is simply not
so. I speak sorrowfully as one who
loves his country and has inspected most
corners of it.
Our country has only two major colors
—brown and grey. You will find green
only where it has been planted and
nurtured. Otherwise there is the brown
bare ground or the grey of our gum-
trees. Dorothea Mackellar was dead
right when she dubbed Australia “sun-
burnt”. The gumtree is the same color
in Victoria as in Northern Queensland—
in Western Australia as in the Blue
Mountains. It is the same color and it
is devastatingly drab, Only in some of
the lush coastal areas, the occasional
pockets of high land and heavy rain, do
we see so-called “luxuriant growth'’.
One such pocket is the little range
which separates coast from interior,
north of Cairns. As you turn inland from
Mossman and climb up, you pass into a
cool world of huge, straight, vividly green
trees, of palms and bananas, of ferns and
vines and choking undergrowth, of drip-
ping leaves. Then, in a few hundred
yards it ends, and you are back once
again to the Australia of the grey-leafed
gumtrees and the long brown roads.
The Cape starts when you turn off the
road to Cooktown and head north-west
from Laura. We had filled our Nissan
with petrol at the Palmer River crossing,
and replenished our plastic water cans.
The first 20 or so miles of the road to
the Cape is in deceptively good order.
But soon we began to feel great sym-
pathy for Queensland's intrepid Gover-
nor, Sir Henry Abel Smith, who, we
heard, intended to travel the same route
by road. Our sympathy was even
greater for his wife, Lady May. The
road to Coen was not designed for a
great-granddaughter of Queen Victoria.
Queen of the Cape
'fl/’E slaked our thirst in the tiny Laura
" pub late in the afternoon, refuelled,
then drove on to the Laura River where
we camped on a dry part of the sand bed.
The river was falling fast (a week later
it had stopped flowing), but we were able
to wash the dust from ourselves, cook
our meal, and bed down under the stars
with the only night noises the occasional
whooping of an owl, the whirr of flying-
foxes, and the soft thud of a kangaroo
coming down to drink at the stream.
The road from Laura to Coen is one
of the worst I have encountered. 1 can-
not understand how those masters of tor-
ture, the Ampol trial planners, have over-
looked it. It is an appalling road, parts
deep in bull-dust, parts half-made, miles
rutted and corrugated. Every 20 or so
miles, as a refinement of the torture, the
road shows signs of smoothness. Then,
wham! and it’s on again. Deep creek
crossings, loose stones, hundred-yard-
long stretches of deep sand where you
spin crazily from side to side. No, it was
not a road for Lady May.
We could not have been happier to
see Coen if it had been one of the
world's greatest tourist cities. There is
only a store, a pub, a police station, a
school, a mission building, a few houses.
But it all looks friendly. The arrival of
a vehicle in Coen is a matter of some
interest and conjecture. Most visitors
prefer, understandably, to fly there. We
pulled up outside the store, and nodded
politely to the oldest inhabitant, who was
sitting contentedly on a bench outside,
his pale eyes peering out from under a
battered, wide felt hat. He nodded back.
Then, “This is Mrs Armbrust's store,” he
announced, his voice displaying an un-
mistakable rustic reverence.
As indeed it should. Mrs Armbrust
is the Queen of the Cape. She practically
owns Coen, and has extensive properties
outside the little outpost. But it is by
force of her personality that she holds
sway. She knows everyone north of
Laura, and she knows the history of
the Cape back to the days of marauding
blacks. She rode on horseback to
Cooktown—some three hundred miles—
to await the arrival of her first child;
and she looks as though the horseback
part of the deal would not be past her
today. She came to the store door to
greet us, found out in quick time who
we were, where we came from, and
where we were going. Mrs Armbrust,
big, kindly-faced, comfortable in her
carpet slippers, got people hustling round
the store attending to our wants, and
sent her daughter for fresh bread (the
Coen bakery is an Armbrust enterprise).
Across the dusty road the Coen pub
door stood invitingly open. Canned beer
is 3s. 6d. a can (popular at Coen,
shunned at Laura, where the locals say
you can taste the metal—l think it’smore
likely the dust in their throats) and sells
like mad. The publican was Chas
Goodwin, an amiable rover whose bear-
ing and general manner gives an un-
mistakeable hint of an army background.
Assisting Chas were his wife and

daughter, the latter a startlingly fair
flower to see blooming in the lonely
wastes of the Cape.
The pub was festooned with signs,
signatures, relics of old days and
drunken nights. A few battered hats
were nailed to the walls, an accompany-
ing legend telling of the wearers. The
pub was rudimentary, but spick and
span. In the bar our companions were
two sturdy men on their way to Old
Rokeby Station to set up a camp for the
soon-to-arrive pro-consul and his party.
The beds, slung on the back of their
truck, were iron and well-worn. “Gawd,
there's a bump in one of them beds,”
said one worthy, “I hope the old Guv’s
a sound sleeper.” “What about that
horsehair mattress Lady May's got to
sleep on?” said the other. “The hair’s all
cornin’ through.” They downed their
beers, climbed aboard their truck, and
set off down the dusty road about their
gubernatorial duties.
We slept that night at the Archer
River, three hours from Coen. It is a
beautiful stream, clear and cool and even
in this dry winter its flow was fairly
good. In the west, of course, it is a
rushing, deep, and impassable barrier.
Its banks are lined with sweet-smelling
paperbarks from which the flying-foxes
hang in their scores. At the Archer we
struck the third vehicle seen on our trek
a Land-Rover in which four young
Northern Territorians were having a
three-month holiday.
Contentment
from burnt-out, deserted home-
steads (Old Mein and York Downs),
Merluna is the only house on the long
rugged haul to Weipa. The owner is
Hardy Wallace and his domain is 1760
square miles (small by comparison with
nearby Old Rokeby, 5000 square miles).
Hardy Wallace and his attractive wife
live in a tin-roofed, tin-sided house on
stilts, in the middle of nowhere. Their
communication is by pedal radio, their
amenities are kerosene refrigerators, their
relaxation an occasional day in Coen,
only possible in the dry season.
How can people stay happy in these
lonely circumstances, their only outside
visitors the occasional crocodile-shooter,
or a workman sent to patch up an air-
strip? Yet Hardy Wallace and his wife
live in the middle of their huge, lonely
domain in contentment. Each year they
organise the Weipa versus Coen cricket
match played on the Merluna airstrip.
This rustic orgy starts on a Saturday and
ends on Monday. The logistical pro-
blems of catering are enormous. Mrs
Armbrust, of the Coen contingent,
brings the bread, butter, cakes and other
good things. The Hardy Wallaces, as
mid-way hosts, kill and prepare a steer
for barbecuing. The Weipa gang bring
the grog, and, most importantly, the ice—
block after block of it, sunk in a truck
full of sawdust. The cricket is not of
high standard after the first couple of
hours. Between Merluna and Weipa we
started to see the Cape cattle. Strong
Brahman influence; good, sturdy beasts.
Among the musterers when we went
through was Jack Harris, working away
with five bullets still in his body after a
recent difference of opinion which has
not yet been before the courts and
therefore cannot be discussed. You may
recall reading the wild northern details
some months ago.
About 20 miles from Weipa, a large
sign has been erected at the side of the
crude track. It warns against entry to
Weipa and threatens prosecution. But
we petrol-starved travellers were in no
shape to heed it, and we forged on over
the deep creek crossings, through the
first of the tidal tributaries, through
taller gumtrees until suddenly we burst
out on to a broad, made road running
at right angles to us on which trucks
sped up and down, carrying in them the
ruddy-faced Comalco workers who are
gouging out the millions of tons of
bauxite for our aluminium industry.
I must confess that in a trek through
the Cape your speed quickens when you
turn for home. You have dreams of hot
showers and Murine drops in the eyes,
and long drinks with cubes of ice bob-
bing in them. Our sons confessed they
were thinking of milkshakes and coke
and food cooked by someone more ex-
pert than Snow and myself. We had
hoped to shoot duck, but we found that

as a shooting proposition the Cape was
not good. Kangaroos, even if you are
prepared to shoot them, are extremely
scarce; you see the occasional emu, the
odd eagle, the small herds of pigs. But
there are more crocodile-shooters than
crocodiles (the shooters roam the estu-
aries, aluminium boats atop their
vehicles, glum expressions on most of
their faces), and my trip confirmed my
long-standing opinion that such a thing
as a “safari” in Australia is a ludicrous
misnomer. It is hard to believe there
are people who find sport in shooting
semi-tame ambling buffalo, and gentle,
inquisitive kangaroos which stand still
for the telescopic sights as long as pos-
sible.
“Relax night”
\S7’e got back to Coen late on a Friday
- evening. Our intention was to press
on 20 miles to the first stream and camp.
But our sons wanted a “properly cooked”
meal, and Mrs Goodwin, the publican's
wife, duly obliged with roast lamb and
vegetables—our first of the latter for
some time.
The bar was, for Coen, crowded —
about ten people. Clothing for some
was “Coen formal”—slacks and shirts;
for others, “Coen informal” —Chesty
Bonds, shorts and thongs. There were
four women in the small bar, the princi-
pal tipple was beer. Friday is apparently
a sort of “relax night” at Coen—men
working on the roads, or mustering, or
tending the phone wires, or watering the
airstrip, come into the town for the
weekend. In addition there were two
wandering Victorians who had spent the
past seven years touring Australia by
caravan. Their life, we gathered, was
idyllic. Their only serious contact with
what went on in the world was through
the financial columns to watch the pro-
gress of the investments which made their
lotus-eating existence possible.
About nine o'clock, when the decibels
in the bar had notched a higher fre-
quency, we first noticed the strange ath-
letic events. Two men dropped to the
floor and, with strange grunts, started to
butt at each other like bulls to the detri-
ment of their skulls. Then other men
got down and started strange judo-like
contests of strength. Chas, the publican,
explained that this was Chinese wrestling,
and the earlier encounters had been bull-
fighting. “Wait till they start the
scratchpole,” he said.
We didn't have long to wait. A pole
was produced, contestants sat on their
behinds on the floor, feet placed against
the opponent's feet, and hands gripping
the pole. Then the strain went on, faces
reddened, veins knotted, until finally the
loser would shoot across the shoulders
of the winner. Soon it became apparent
that a strongly-built but slight man of
about 40 was undisputed champion at
this game. My friend Snow challenged
him, and was tossed aside in about 20
seconds. 1 lasted about five. The
heaviest, most enormous man in the
room —a bulldozer operator—lasted a
couple of minutes before he went flying
over the champion's shoulders.
The champion proved to be Sgt Tom
Newman, head policeman for the enor-
mous area from just above Laura to the
tip of the Cape. He handles it with
two constables and a few black-trackers.
Until a year or so ago he had 18 horses
—now the job is done largely with
jeeps. Newman is the law, and is affec-
tionately referred to as the Marshal; and
his young constables as ‘‘Deputy”. He
is in charge of Aborigines throughout his
vast bailiwick, acts as counsellor, banker
(he collects £40,000 u year on their be-
half and banks it), marries them, and
arranges their burial. He sees in the
proposal to give the Aborigines control
of their own financial affairs a national
tragedy. “Some of the Abos have £3OOO
in the bank,” said Newman. “But low-
down white crooks are just waiting to
fleece them when the blacks get control
of their own affairs. Every one of them
up here will be broke in a year.”
Tom Newman is one of the most re-
markable men I have met —and the only
man I have ever seen hang from a ledge
by his toes. I refused to believe he
could do this when one of the drinkers
told me, but after some persuasion the
nimble sergeant placed his fingers on the
ledge over the hotel door, swung up,
fixed his toes over the ledge and hung
head down fully extended. “Good God,
you must be fit,” I said when he was
right way up again. “When you're a
policeman up here,” said Tom, “you've
got to be the fittest man in town.”
The Man from Los Angeles
T was a bit worried that some of the
■ drinkers had been some hours at the
bar without food. I need not have wor-
ried. The steady, almost silent, group
along the bar suddenly demanded of the
publican what he could offer as a coun-
ter-dinner. Chas examined his fridge, and
produced two tins of chilled Japanese
crab and a tin-opener. The drinkers
put down their beer and waded solemnly
through the tinned crab, topping it off
with a dessert composed of one violet
crumble bar each. They are rugged men
in the north.
It was quite a night. Luke, one of the
old identities, started quoting Banjo Pat-
erson, with certain interpolations which
might have startled the author. A young
American burst into the bar, dust-spat-
tered, and announced to the startled com-
pany that he came from Los Angeles
and was riding a motor-cycle round the
world. (We saw the poor chap’s tracks

in the sand next day. He had pushed
his vehicle for miles on the horror
roads.)
Time was passing, and the younger
members of our team were sleepy and
over-full of lemonade. But Tom New-
man poo-poohed the idea that we should
drive out of town and camp. “You
must stay in my house,” he said. “You
can sleep on the verandah and there is a
hot shower. I will have you up at 6, give
you poached eggs on toast at 6.30, and
by 7 you’ll be on the road.” It
sounded irresistible. Tom led us up the
little street to the police station com-
pound; we blew up our li-lo’s and bedded
down on the verandah.
The alarm woke us at 6 a.m. Pale
dawn, a few roosters wailing, and a
flight of crows making their mournful
way across the tiny town. We shaved,
showered in the luxury of the sergeant’s
hot water, and packed our gear. No
movement from Sgt Tom. We stamped
round the house and rattled frying-pans.
The sergeant slept on. At 6.30 we lit
the wood stove and started to boil some
water. At 7 a.m. the puzzled face of a
black-tracker appeared at the kitchen
door, examined us and disappeared. At
7.30 we were vainly trying to boil eggs
on the stove which apparently contained
some heat-making secret unknown to us.
At 8 a.m. we buttered some bread,
spread it with Marmite and drank some
luke-warm coffee. Then at 8 a.m. we
penned a thank-you to Tom Newman,
left it outside his door, climbed aboard
our Nissan and started on the long,
bumpy road back to civilisation.
“The King and I”
The new heavyweight from Armidale
By HUGH CURNOW
It would not be accurate to describe
East-West Airlines chairman Mr
Don Shand as imperturbable these
days. On several subjects he is highly
volatile just now. Top of his blood-pres-
sure group is Mr Reg Ansett. Our view
of the new heavyweight from Armidale
fighting back went like this:
Q. Mr Ansett says the NSW Govern-
ment’s stated reasons for its decision to
allot some of his air routes to you is
prompted by the need to avoid a threat-
ened monopoly.
Shand: So it bloody well should be.
Q. But Mr Ansett goes on to say
that his airline and yours are not even
in competition.
Shand: Who does he think he’s kid-
ding? Airlines are in competition just by
existing together in the same State. How
else can passengers compare prices,
service, reliability of time tables and
safety? If that’s not competition, what
is?
Q. Mr Ansett also says his airline has
made no move to interfere with yours.
Shand: They’re soft, they’re spherical
and they bounce! Old King Reg organ-
ised a door-to-door canvass of our 400
shareholders back in ’6l to see if he
could get them to sell their holdings
to him at £2/16/- for a £l'share. That’s
not only interference in my book, it’s
downright shameful.
Q. Furthermore, Mr Ansett says his
airline has expressed a willingness and
desire to co-operate with yours.
Shand: Read “dominate” for “co-oper-
ate” and you’ve got the gist of it.
Q. He goes on to point out that, in
his opinion, each airline already has its
own route structure appropriate to capi-
tal structure.
Shand: What the hell does that mean?
Q. Perhaps that
Shand: Wait a minute, Lester can
answer that one. (Enter Mr Lester Brain,
former Managing Director of De Havil-
land Aircraft, and before that General
Manager of ANA Commission (TAA),
1946-55, now a company director and
consultant who lives at Sydney’s Point
Piper and advises Mr Shand.)
Brain: Yes, I think I can. What he
means is that the number of air routes
an airline can (or even should) operate
is dependent on how much money it has.
The opposite in fact has always been
the case in my experience. In short, I
would say Mr Ansett is putting the cart
before the horse.
Shand: Exactly.
Q. Mr Ansett insists, also, that your
claim of having £291,000 paid-up capital
cannot be justified. He says you achieved
this figure by unorthodox means, namely
by writing in an extra £lOO,OOO as “good-
will” value.
Shand: And if you’d been offered
£2/16/- for each quid you had, wouldn’t
you reckon they’d boomed in “good-
will” value, too? Unorthodox baloney!
Q. What about Mr Ansett’s claim that
the air-routes he says are to be “con-
fiscated” from him by the NSW Govern-
ment are worth £200,000.
Shand: Nonsense! Bloody Old King
Reg again, that’s all that is. How can
the Government confiscate his air routes?
They aren’t his property. He leases from
the Public Transport people like anyone
else. Those licences to operate the routes
can be given to other people besides him.
They have to be re-applied for and re-
newed every year, don’t forget. He thinks
he owns everything. That’s half his
trouble, if you ask me.
Q. Mr Ansett says the majority of
your shares are held by a small band of
wealthy men.
Shand: Not true! Not true! There are
no large shareholders in East-West. No
one at all has more than £lO,OOO worth
of our shares in a single holding. And
there are no concealed holdings either.
Our wealthiest shareholders in fact have
only £2OO-£3OO worth of shares each.
But they could buy and sell Ansett if they
wanted to.
Q. That sounds like a threat.
Shand: It’s about time. I won’t go
the way of Butler Air Transport—you
can count on that.

Bacterial Life in a Stiff Collar
Those were the days at Geelong
By BATMAN
The announcement that I was to go
to Geelong Grammar came as a
shock. It was one of those fearful
nights when parents come to decisions.
My father said he was not satisfied with
what Melbourne Grammar had done for
me, nor was he satisfied with what it had
done for my brother.
Then he enlarged on the charms of
Geelong. This was the finest school in
the Southern Hemisphere, the Eton of
Australia. Important men sent their sons
from all over the world to Geelong
Grammar. It had the teachers, a magnifi-
cent situation, and, of course, the cost
was immense. But this was something
worth doing for my future.
My father was in one of his deter-
mined moods. I knew by now when
decisions were irrevocable and there
was no choice but to appear to be grate-
ful.
Yet 1 had my opinions of Geelong
Grammar. To a 13-year-old at that time,
Melbourne Grammar, beyond doubt, was
THE school. It repeatedly thrashed all
others at sport. Its record on the foot-
ball field under the brilliant coach
“Bully” Taylor was superb. The match
against Scotch College was always the
event of the year and any event against
Geelong Grammar was considered noth-
ing more than a mild training exercise.
The Geelong Grammar boys in their
pale blue caps, hard collars and inevitable
fair hair always looked slightly effemi-
nate and we called them “a mob of
poofters.” Geelong never won anything
except an occasional boat race and as a
13-year-old I knew that we had the finest
school song, a real rabble-rouser sung
to the tune of “The Men of Harlech.”
The chorus went:
“None our ranks shall sunder,
Who will shirk or blunder
If all are true
To our dark blue
Our foemen shall go under . . .
UNDAH . . .
V
Whereas Geelong had a school song
sung entirely in Latin to a melancholy
tune that must have come from the Eng-
lish hymnal. And it was true, in later
years at boat races, I did find it an em-
barrassment having a school song that
was sung in Latin, and even when I was
doing Leaving Latin I wasn’t entirely
sure as to what it all meant.
The lonely year
Co one day in February, not long before
the Second World War, I was thrust
into the monastic existence of boarding
school. The first year tended to be rather
lonely. Parents were allowed to visit just
three times a term and one was allowed
to go out on an exeat by permission of
the Housemaster.
This meant that parents could pick
you up after Chapel on Sunday morning
and return you before dinner at 6 p.m.
The thing to do was to go on a picnic
to Ocean Grove, Anglesea, or, if father
was feeling expansive, there was a splen-
did stomach-filling buffet lunch to be had
at the Barwon Heads Golf Club.
As a senior school boy it was a relief
to discover that I did not have to wear
one of those abominable Eton collars.
For weekday wear one wore grey slacks,
an open-necked blue shirt and a sports
coat.
However, formal wear was necessary
for Sundays, a grey suit, pale blue tie
and a hard collar.
As a new boy in a junior dormitory,
naturally I was the lowest form of bac-
terial life. Yet as a regular reader of the
“Magnet” and the “Gem” I had a fair
idea what to expect.
There were five houses in the senior
school based pretty much on the English
system. Four were residential and one
was for day boys who came in from
Geelong. There was a list of menial
duties to be carried out every day, such
as cleaning out locker-rooms and such.
We weren’t actually called “fags” but
I was assigned to one of the House pre-
fects for fagging duties. I had to clean
his study, wash his pots and pans, and
polish his brass buttons and boots on
cadet days. There was one major dif-
ference from the fags in the “Magnet”.
They always seemed to get paid, but I
never got anything from my prefect
except an occasional slice of toast or a
piece of cake. Yet it was a fine way of
enforcing discipline. Even now when I
see that same House prefect, somewhere
in a city club, he seems an immense
fellow and I wonder whether I shouldn’t
get to work and clean his shoes or polish
his buttons.
It was a spartan existence. Corio was
renowned for the savagery of its Antarc-


tic winds in the winter, yet there were
no hot showers. This could be something
of an agony when coming in covered in
mud after football, and it was compul-
sory to have a cold shower every morn-
ing. Personally I never found the morn-
ing cold shower much of a problem. By
developing a skilful turnabout technique
one could make sure that no more than
two or three drops ever fell on the bare
back.
Again in the English tradition one had
a weekly bath. This took place on a
rostered night and, as is often necessary
in monastic institutions, it was done in
threes and it was hot. Seeing that bath
night always meant half an hour less
study, this was pure joy.
Some of the English public school
attitudes rested with us. I don’t think there
was any actual social snobbery. We were
told that in the days of Dr Francis Brown
the sons of the men in trade were not
welcome at Geelong, but this was no
longer true. And although we had all the
wealthy from the Western district, there
was no looking down on the scholarship
boy. The attitude was the reverse. It was
the fashion for some on the teaching staff
to be Left-wing intellectual.
There was, though, this curious old
English outlook in regard to sport. We
had a young man whose one ambition
was to win the mile for Geelong Gram-
mar. So in those days, long before John
Landy was ever a schoolboy there, he
used to rise at six and pound round and
round the school oval, mile after mile.
He never did win the school mile, but
after his first limited successes, none of
us were impressed. “So he should, the
bastard; look at all the training he did.”
Caste
nPHEN there was the well-planned caste
system. Every boy in the House was
numbered, say from 68, who was the
most miserable junior, up to number 1,
who was the huge figure of the House
Captain. Your number was on your tuck
locker, your clothes peg, everything. And
so you mounted the scale in numbers
directly in accordance to seniority com-
bined with your ability on the playing
field and in the class-room. At House
assembly everyone always lined up by
numbers, 1 to 68, and you were always
rather conscious of the fact that while
you were 61, Robinson was 52 and Riley
was 48.
And, as in many boarding schools,
there was a tradition of bullying. This
was always done very early on Saturday
mornings by the gentlemen of the senior
dormitories. If it was considered that the
boys in junior dormitory were becoming
presumptuous, rather above themselves,
they would be called upstairs for treat-
ment.
One Saturday morning in June I was
called up with six others and repriman-
ded. Then I was told to put on shorts
and a pair of sandshoes. We were taken
for a run a mile across the paddocks and
then forced to dive into an icy mud pond
and push ourselves round and round on
our stomachs.
Three years later it was our turn. A
group of young fellows who had been
getting above themselves were called up
to our dormitory. But there was one
fellow, who was afterwards to become a
brilliant scholar of the Japanese language
and culture, who had a bed by the door.
As the junior dormitory boys came in,
he quietly told them it was a mistake and
they weren’t wanted. The dressing-down
lapsed and the rest of us felt rather
ashamed. So there was no bullying after
that and 1 hope on that Saturday morn-
ing the tradition ended for all time.
By the time 1 arrived, James Ralph
Darling was already acknowledged a
great headmaster. He is now, of course,
chairman of the ABC, but he looked no
different then. Except that to a small boy
who only came up to his waistcoat but-
tons, he looked an appalling figure of
authority. He walked slightly bent with
his arms behind his back and with his
billowing gown and mortarboard he
seemed seven feet tall.
It wasn’t that he was a harsh authori-
tarian, he was very human, but he had
an aura about him. Whenever we were
called to a special assembly to be cas-
tigated about our behavior at the boat
race, or our declining morals, it was im-
possible to escape a sick feeling in the
stomach. Or, to be summoned to the
head's study for some frightful offence,
it was like walking death’s row.
Behind his back we called him the
Boss or simply Ralphie, In public he
tended to decry the evils of school sport
but whenever Geelong had a minor suc-
cess on the playing field he found it
impossible to hide his satisfaction com-
pletely. He injected everything with a
vast moral tone, and he urged us to enter
worthy occupations where we could serve
our fellow man. In my day he cited the
charms of the public service, the perma-
nent military forces and, of course, the
church. The mere pursuit of money-
making was an evil which sometimes
made us wonder. If we wanted to send
our sons to the same expensive school
what hope did we have?
The Left-wingers
We had a good deal of church prayers
" twice daily, and if one were a
Communicant, three times on Sunday.
The long hours of religion along with the
heavy sermons from so many visiting
clerics could be an agony and maybe
drove many out of the church for life.
Yet it made a real impression on some.
I remember my days in the school choir,
singing the Messiah, the Creation and
even the Bach B Minor Mass in the cold
but beautiful school chapel, as amongst
my happiest at Corio.
Mr Darling, he was no Doctor then,
could be wearing. He was forever burn-
ing with ideas for better education and
for worthy projects that utterly destroyed
the school vacation. On his staff he show-
ed a leaning towards those with degrees
from the better English universities
rather than some of those with a solid
grounding in local education.
As I said earlier, we had several bril-
liant Left-wing intellectuals on the staff.
They would talk to us of the wonders of
socialism and gave us our first guilt com-
plexes about the modern order of society.
There was one fellow with a marvellous
academic record who used to tell us most
amusingly about sex. This indeed was
exciting because sex in those days was
a phenomenon that wasn't supposed to
exist. He talked, too, of the fatuity of
religion and waited his moment until we
came back from chapel. His banter would
go like this:
“You’re late. Why?”
“We’ve been at chapel, Sir.”
“Huh. Jesus racket again. Always
wasting your time when you could be
learning something important. Oh, well,
I don’t suppose it can do you any harm.
At least the Anglican Church provides
more exercise than most. There’s an in-
credible amount of standing up and
kneeling down.”
Now this used to startle us. How could
this man survive? Surely Mr Darling
knew about his attitude? And the pre-
sumption was: Mr Darling was perhaps a
very naive fellow allowing anti-Gods and
Bolshies in our tender midst.
It was only in later years that I came
to realise that he must have known very
well and it was merely part of his practi-
cal measures in encouraging some of his
students at least to think things out for
themselves.
Sometimes this could be a heady diet
for 16 and 17 year olds. School spirit


was an important thing and attendance
at all school and house matches was
very nearly as vital as attending chapel.
One time several of us got the idea
that this boosting of school spirit was
the very thing that caused nationalism
and hence all wars. So on the day of a
serious school match we decided to do
something more important for our well-
being and we went for a tour of the Ford
factory at Geelong.
As we returned on our bicycles the
whole House was waiting for us eagerly.
It was not the traditional Frog March
as in the “Magnet”. They had more
specialised local treatment —an enforced
winter swim around the rowing pond. I
had just been thrown into the water
when the House Captain appeared and
the lynching stopped.
The value of institutions such as Gee-
long Grammar is a never-ending argu-
ment. We felt then it cost so much money
that it had to be good. The scholas-
tic results were not always brilliant on
the statistics. Melbourne High School, for
example, could compare most favorably.
But then statistics were no real guide
because there was a heavy leavening from
the Western District and there were
plenty who had no interest in scholastic
honors.
It wasn’t easy then to point to great
old boys. Unlike Eton, we were not run-
ning the country. Melbourne Grammar
can now point to three members of the
House of Lords, Lord Baillieu, Lord
Bruce and Lord Casey. However, the
next 10 years could be the most interes-
ting for Geelong Grammar. These will
give the proof of the Darling regime, for
in that time the boys of his era will be
reaching to the top of their professions.
Already they are making fair progress.
There are at least four in the Federal
Cabinet, and there are groups in the dip-
lomatic service, the top teaching posts at
the universities plus some very
distinguished doctors and lawyers.
Boarding school, like going to the den-
tist, can be a most unpleasant experience.
However, if the filling remains in the
tooth, then the experience can be worth-
while.
On the Margin
The Loneliness of
The Long-distance Walker
A racing man who died in Sydney
some years ago was described in
obituary notices as “a sporting iden-
tity”. This is a term reserved by the
Press for notorious rogues, so I asked
a veteran journalist how the deceased
had got his reputation. The reply was:
“He used to run a stable of crook
pedestrians.”
The phrase took one back to a time
when walking was a more important
activity than it is today. The stakes
in professional walking races, and the
bets on them, were high enough to
make it worthwhile for some of the
entrants to walk dead. The nearest we
have to a crook pedestrian now is
one who walks when the lights say
“Don’t Walk”.
The social decline of walking is a
melancholy fact of our time. The
pedestrian, formerly an insider, has
become an outsider. One only has to
think of the loneliness of a pedestrian
at a drive-in theatre. It is a poignant
example of what book-reviewers call
the human predicament.
Lately my wife and I have taken
to going for short walks on Sunday
afternoons. We find that we are re-
garded in the district as eccentrics.
Neighbors stare in surprise, or smile
indulgently, as we go past propelled
by our quaint, obsolete power-unit, the
legs.
Yet walking is known to be a
healthy way of getting about. Doctors
point to the longevity of postmen as
compared with financiers. A convert
to this opinion was President Kennedy,
who urged his countrymen to go for
walks. But his exhortations have had
little effect. Indeed, the late Presi-
dent’s interest in walking was one of
the things about him which patriots
felt to be subversive of the American
way of life. Barry Goldwater, who
drives sports cars, is careful to avoid
being taken for a pedestrian.
What can be done to bring walking
back into fashion? Its advocates argue,
rather naively, that it has the advan-
tage of being cheap. In reality this is
the main reason why it lacks appeal.
Motor cars are expensive, and the
person who owns one feels important.
Walking will not make anyone feel
important until the pedestrian has (it
is hard to avoid the term) a status
symbol.
The obvious, indeed the only, equip-
ment available for this purpose is his
shoes. At present shoes are advertised
and promoted far less excitingly than
cars. Any small boy can identify a
Ford, a Holden, a VW; but he could
not point out a passing pedestrian’s
footwear and say to his father:
‘‘Selby”, “Hansman”, or “Humphries”.
Much more could be done to direct
public interest to footwear. One idea
would be the road-testing of new shoes
by experienced walkers. Recently I
bought a new pair of shoes, Why-
brow's Americano model. To show
what could be done in this line, I took
them over the test route: Castlereagh
St. King’s Cross Castlereagh St.
Here is the report:
The Whybrow Americano is a light
but robust shoe in the middle price-
bracket. Its styling is uncluttered and
functional, without the extreme pointi-
ness which some designers favor (and
of which the only apparent function
is kicking people).
Specifications: Black calf upper, tri-
ple-sewn toecap, three eyelets, leather
insole; rubber heels optional extra.
Walking characteristics: The test
pair, which came straight from the
dealer, had a tendency to squeak.
This should disappear after the run-
ning-in period. Fitting was comfort-
able, though slight stiffness caused
sore toes by the end of the test.
Performance: The Americano res-
ponded well in climbing William
Street hill under wet and unfavorable
conditions. The shoe cornered willing-
ly and showed good roadholding
qualities. The only lapse was an un-
fortunate skid outside the King’s
Head Hotel.
Summary: A lively shoe for
the sporting pedestrian who likes to
“let her out” on the open footpath;
also rugged enough to come through
a suburban horror-stretch.
This is the kind of foot-journalism
I have in mind. It would help to raise
the pedestrian’s morale by giving him
pride of ownership. The feeling can be
encouraged equally among female
pedestrians. They should be taught
that it gives a sense of achievement
to have better shoes than the woman
next door though not necessarily
bigger ones.
ROSS CAMPBELL


OVERSEAS
Red Split
Helps
Soekarno
A whiff of the had old times?
From EDWARD CRANKSHAW
in London
The struggle for Asia has been totally
transformed by the openly de-
clared power rivalry between
China and the Soviet Union. What for
years was a straight forward conflict be-
tween Communist and American am-
bition has been complicated beyond
measure by the Sino-Soviet quarrel.
Thus, last week the Chinese solemnly
pledged their unwavering support of
President Soekarno’s Indonesia in the
conflict with Malaysia.
The “People’s Daily” announced that
the United States and Britain (in that
order) are trying to build up Malaysia
into a military bastion against China,
North Vietnam and Indonesia. “Should
US imperialism dare to launch aggression
against Indonesia, the Chinese people
will back the Indonesian people with all
their might.”
This vow, which need not be taken
seriously (the Chinese have no means
of carrying out large-scale intervention
in Indonesia), is interesting as a classic
example of the sort of opportunism of
which the Chinese are always accusing
Mr Khrushchev. It is also directed more
against the Soviet Union than the US.
It was Russian aid to Soekarno which
was picked on by the Chinese as a major
example of Russian perfidy when the
great quarrel was coming to a head four
years ago. In one of his interventions
at the famous all-party meeting of
November, 1960, which has never been
made public, Mr Khrushchev said that
Peking had protested officially to the
Soviet against the provision of aid to
Soekarno, and had pointed out that in
1948 Soekarno had been responsible for
murdering most of the leadership of the
Indonesian Communist Party.
This was correct, Mr Khrushchev
conceded, and one day Soekarno would
be made to pay for this crime. Mean-
while, it was necessary to apply “an
objective evaluation to the situation”.
Soekarno had in fact done more for the
strong Communist Party of Indonesia
than the Chinese comrades had done.
And he had helped the Communist cause
by fighting against the notorious compra-
dors (merchants of largely Chinese
nationality) whom Peking had been
backing precisely because they were
Chinese, thus acting out of narrow
nationalism and making the very word
Communist stink in the nostrils of Indo-
nesians.
Now the Chinese themselves find it
expedient, as part of the struggle for
Asia, to outbid the Russians vis-a-vis
Soekarno.
This is only the latest example of a
whole series of actions over the past
three years which show that beneath all
their pretence of ideological purity and
rectitude the Chinese are pursuing what
is essentially a power struggle in
Khrushchev’s words, a “cold war”
against the Soviet Union.
The fraternal parties know this, too,
and this is one of the reasons why so
many of them are against the formalisa-
tion of the split—and against Khrush-
chev’s famous meeting. The leadership
of all the more sophisticated parties
know that both Russia and China are
trying to use the world Communist
movement as an instrument in their
rivalry. To the more dedicated among
them this must seem a sort of blasphemy.
The consciousness of this new fact was
the main inspiration of Signor Togliatti’s
so-called “testament”: he did not want
the world Communist movement, above
all, the Italian Communist movement, to
be perverted by either of the two great
contestants in this way.
Russia’s ways are all too familiar from
long experience. To those party loyalists
all over the world who suffered in
silence from Stalin’s bullying techniques,
Khrushchev’s overbearing conduct to-
wards the Chinese, and his forcing
through of a new all-party meeting in
the teeth of widespread disapproval,
seems like a whiff of the bad old times.
China, on the other hand, is far away,
mysterious, .and obscure. With in-
vincible self-righteousness, the Chinese
leadership has been preaching pure
Leninism and exuding revolutionary
fervor in a way long abandoned by
Moscow. Not many of the comrades
know enough about Chinese activity in
Asia and elsewhere to realise that Peking
is far from practising what it preaches.
Meanwhile, the general situation re-
mains confused. Why does Khrushchev
feel strong enough not merely to attack
China with such single-track determina-
tion but also to allow Togliatti’s criticisms
from the other flank to be printed in
Pravda ? Does he know more than we
know about the divisions within the
Chinese party?
All we know is that there is a real
war of nerves in progress; this should
make us sceptical of all reports from
both sides. In a war of nerves words
are designed to mislead: only actions
reveal, (ofns)
British Elections
Labor’s
Menu
"It has no price"—Sir Alec
From NORA BELOFF in London
The leaders of Britain's two major
parties, in fighting speeches rally-
ing their troops on the eve of the
opening of the official election campaign,
agreed that the nation was confronting
a historical and fateful choice — but dis-
agreed on what the choices were.
The Prime Minister said it was be-
tween Conservative rule by consent and
Labor planning by compulsion, between
the Conservative determination to keep
the deterrent and Labor's readiness to
abandon Britain's means of self-defence
—an issue overshadowing everything.
Mr Wilson said nothing about the bomb
but expressed concern on economic ex-
pansion and fairer shares, promising to
treat housing like “a wartime operation".
The Labor manifesto is a menu with-
out prices, Sir Alec Douglas-Home told
a Tory rally.
“There is not a word in it about
where the money is to come from,” he
said. “Without that the prospectus is
void.”
He listed the three main differences
between the two parties: “First, all our
plans for the future stem from past
success. They are a continuation and
development of policies which have been
shown to work.
“Second, we have in every case
counted the cost. And thirdly, while
both parties plan ahead, ours is plan-
ning by consent and partnership, theirs
is planning by compulsion.”
Sir Alec said perhaps the quickest
way to lose our prosperity, in which mil-
lions of people now own their own
homes and could take shares in industry,
would be to fall for all the promises in
the Labor manifesto.
“Overshadowing everything is the

control over her nuclear arms,” he said.
“By doing so they would hand over the
right to decide our future to another
country. This is something the British
people have never been prepared to do in
all their long history.”
These were the main topics of Sir
Alec’s speech:—
Nationalisation: Not one word of jus-
tification in the Socialist manifesto. It
is a doctrine, and that is that.
Social Services: I do not believe the
Socialist plans could be put into effect
without harsh additional taxation im-
pairing the sources of wealth.
Land prices: We have an open mind
on the subject. We want to be certain
when we tackle land profits that any tax
does not add to the prices of houses or
dry up the supply.
Government re-organisation: We do
not believe in adding more Ministers in
Whitehall —there are enough.
Restrictive practices: The Socialists
cling to them like limpets. In the next
Parliament the Conservative Government
will expect to receive the full and active
co-operation of employers and the trade
unions in discarding them and increasing
productivity, (ofns)
The Labor Manifesto
From a Correspondent in London
T abor’s election manifesto contained
little that has not already been dis-
cussed in public, whether by accident or
design. This is not surprising since the
party has had its sleeves rolled up, spoil-
ing for a fight, ever since Mr Harold
Wilson became leader.
The manifesto demotes public owner-
ship as the central feature of British
Socialism (one paragraph in 28 pages).
It meets Tory charges that Britain
under Labor wculd be run by faceless
bureaucrats by proposing an ombudsman
to deal with public grievances.
The manifesto indicates that Labor
planning under a new Minister of Eco-
nomic Affairs would, have three func-
tions: increasing investment, expanding
exports and replacing inessential imports.
But there is no suggestion that invest-
ment will rise at the expense of con-
sumption. On the contrary, the mani-
festo promises rapid and immediate
growth in well-being and essential ser-
vices. Labor's answer to “You’ve never
had it so good” is to be “You could and
should have it a great deal better”.
Controversial proposals include: —
1. Fiscal reform: A major capital
gains tax, but no mention of the wealth
tax.
2. Education: Compulsory secondary
education on comprehensive lines, with a

Vatican III
The most obscure phase
From PATRICK O’DONOVAN
in Rome
The Council of the Roman Church,
now beginning its third session in
the Vatican, is about to enter its
most obscure and its most important
phase. This is daunting, since even close
observers have been uncertain and
divided about its significance and direc-
tion.
Some of this difficulty springs from
a justifiable misunderstanding of the
nature of the Council. It consists of
2500 working bishops of various ranks.
During the first two sessions it was
rightly observed that there existed two
main points of view, and the clashes
between the leaders of these were
occasionally angry, coldly venomous or
heartbroken.
By far the largest numbers belong to
those who were anxious for change and
reform and modernisation.
There was a powerful minority who
fought tooth, nail and crozier for the
status quo, who believed even in the
strengthening of this position in the face
of a doubting world.
As this is an assembly that votes, it
was easy to expect an overwhelming
victory for the majority. But it is not
so simple. This is not a parliament of
defined parties.
It is an assembly, admittedly tired of
being summoned to the inconveniences
of Rome, who genuinely believe it is
doing God’s work. It follows that some
will conscientiously suppress their per-
sonal preferences in deference to what
they believe is good for holy religion.
The Pope’s authority and influence
over it is final. He is, in effect, more
powerful than the 2500, because they
will it so; because he can dissolve it,
because his personal authority alone, to
Roman Catholics, is equal to that of the
whole Church assembled. It is this
authority and its relationship with the
bishops that now looms in dispute. It
profoundly affects the dogma which
probably most offends Protestant and
orthodox alike.
Most organised Christians believe that
the whole Church (an undefined entity)
is infallible. Only Roman Catholics
believe in the infallibility of the Bishop
of Rome. Indeed, at the last Council
an influential minority opposed the
definition, not as wrong, but as “inoppor-
tune”. Now the unfinished business is
being tackled.
At present the tendency of this session
is disappointing to non-Roman Chris-
tians. They half expected a watering
down of the colossal papal claims, with
the bishops raised to new heights.
It must be said that, despite his
courtesy to the “separated brethren”,
Pope Paul has proffered no false hopes.
He was careful to insist in his opening
address that he cannot abandon any
truth. And he expressed the great claim
of his Church once again the claim
that both offends and bewilders the other
churches. He said: “The hour has
sounded when the Church must say of
herself what Christ intended and willed
her to be.” It is a statement that makes
impossible any compromise on anything
that he considers matters, (ofns)

FORUM
Dean Dixon Out of Tune
A case AGAINST the Sydney orchestra touring Europe
By DAVID A. LEYPOLDT
A fter congratulating ourselves and the
** Australian Broadcasting Commission
on the appointment of such an eminent
musician as Mr Dean Dixon to the post
of musical director of the Sydney Sym-
phony Orchestra, it is distressing to find
a situation arising in which the ABC
appears to question Mr Dixon’s authority.
This is a result of the ABC’s obstinate
intention to send the orchestra to Europe,
against the wishes of Mr Dixon.
The general manager of the ABC, Sir
Charles Moses, has quoted a letter re-
ceived from Mr Dixon on June 10,
stating his approval of the projected tour.
Obviously, the implication of this state-
ment is that Mr Dixon has been expres-
sing contradictory opinions. The public
should be made aware of the fact that
this letter was written before Mr Dixon’s
return to Australia after an absence of
more than 18 months, during which time
he had no opportunity to assess the
orchestra’s standard. After his return,
and as a result of two months’ intensive
activity with the orchestra his opinion
became quite definite. He emphatically
stated that the orchestra was not ready
for a European tour and would not be
ready for a further two seasons.
It is interesting to note, too, the tac-
tics used to bring the orchestra around
to Sir Charles’ way of thinking. The
orchestra, in recent weeks split up by
commitments with both the Little Sym-
phony Orchestra and the Opera-Ballet
season, was informed by its concert-
master of “Sir Charles’ faith in the
ability of the players to be ready for
the trip in September.” I wonder if, at
the same time, it was told of its musical
director’s opinions, which would perhaps
be a little more pertinent than those of
an administrative officer. Apparently, the
ABC itself feels that the orchestra at
this stage is scarcely equipped for a tour,
as it intends to borrow principals, in mid-
season, from other Australian orchestras.
At the same time it was suggested that
if it did not take this opportunity the
orchestra would not have another chance
to tour.
Surely anyone who knows the Euro-
pean festival system would know that im-
presarios are always looking for some-
thing new of first-class quality. If it were
to tour next year, and make an unfavor-
able impression the likelihood of it being
invited again to tour in such a musically
prodigious climate would be small indeed.
How much better to follow the advice
of its Musical Director, and keep pat-
ience until, in his opinion, the quality
of its performance was such that it could
truly do itself and its country justice.
It would serve no good purpose, I am
sure, either for the orchestra’s con-
fidence, or Mr Dixon’s European reputa-
tion, were the orchestra to tour next year
and receive patronising reviews from
condescending critics. Would it not also
be extremely embarrassing for Mr Dixon
to have his name emblazoned upon the
brochure, recently published by the
ABC, and reportedly to be used during
the proposed tour, when this orchestra
would be in Europe contrary to his
wishes?
The whole affair shows disturbing
signs of wilful disrespect of Mr
Dixon’s position. One possible effect
could be that Mr Dixon may find it
embarrassing to fulfil his contract with
the Sydney Symphony Orchestra. The
Hessian radio, with which Mr Dixon is
occupied while in Frankfurt, has given
him one week’s leave of absence to per-
form with the Sydney Symphony Orches-
tra during their London concerts. Rather
significantly, perhaps, Mr Dixon has not
said that he intends to visit London in
September.
"Anti-Semitic” Unity Tickets
Will someone prod Jim Killen?
By ISI LEIBLER
Eric D. Butler, National Director
of the Australian League of Rights,
generally regarded as Australia’s
No. 1 Jew-baiter and spokesman for a
species of the ultra Right-wing, is again
in the news. Butler recently returned
from a world-wide “lecture tour”, during
which he strengthened his standing as a
“personality” in the galaxy of internation-
al English-speaking reactionaries and anti-
Semites.
In Canada, Butler was the guest of
Ron Gostick, leader of the Canadian
Christian Action Movement —a fanatical
Right-wing, anti-Semitic outfit carry-
ing on similar activities to the Australian
League of Rights. Butler conceded that
the Canadian “tour” was a fiasco. The
Canadian Press, radio and television
attacked him as a hate pedlar, and
students, led by “agents of the world
conspiracy”, continually broke up meet-
ings and “shamelessly smeared and mis-
represented” him.
When accused of anti-Semitism, But-
ler invariably avoids the charge and des-
cribes anti-Semitism as “a Communist
weapon used on its enemies”. He was
asked by a reporter during his recent tour
in South Africa, whether his anti-
Semitism could not be confirmed by his
magnum opus, “The International Jew”
a personally annotated Butler version
of the infamous forgery “The Protocols
of the Elders of Zion”, which depicts
Jews as the sinister force behind Com-
munism, capitalism and subversion, sys-
tematically eroding civilisation as a step
towards the Jewish goal of a World Slave
State. Butler conceded having written
“The International Jew”, but insisted that
far from being anti-Semitic, it was writ-
ten “to draw attention to the menace
of anti-Semitism”!
Butler, of course, does not broadcast
the fact that his bookshop is the central
distributing agency for some of the vilest
racialist and anti - Semitic literature in
Australia. Amongst the classics to be
found here are the “Protocols of the
Elders of Zion”, and books by notorious
Jew-baiters like Colin Jordan, the leader
of the British Nazi Party.
Butler’s political survival is dependent
on patronage by “cleanskins” occupying
responsible positions in civic and politi-
cal life. Recently, two of these gave him
a badly needed boost broadcaster
Norman Banks and James Killen, MHR
for Moreton.
Banks, who frequently refers to Butler
on the air as “my dear friend Eric”, has
often promoted Butler and the League
of Rights through Radio 3AW. Last week
he enabled Butler to reach greater heights
by inviting him as a guest on his Mel-
bourne television discussion panel.
Butler was presented as an expert on
Communism and foreign affairs. He pru-
dently avoided “the Jewish Problem” and
restricted his contribution to emphasising
that the United States race riots and the
Negro struggle for Civil Rights were
dominated by Communists, that the
French-Canadian separatist fanatics were
controlled by Castroist Communists, and
that Goldwater was the best hope for the
world. When he began extolling the John
Birch Society, Banks swiftly steered him
away from the subject. One would have

There’s been a dramatic breakthrough in computer
technology. Overnight, a single system has been
introduced to handle all data-processing problems for
commerce, science, engineering, communications and
control. This is the greatest single advance in the
history of IBM Data Processing—THE IBM
SYSTEM/360.
Tiny micro-circuits, have facilitated new computer
compactness, new computer architecture, new speeds
measurable by the billionth of a second. The storage
capacity and breadth of application of the SYSTEM/
360 are far in advance of previous equipment. It
brings you more useful answers per pound of cost.
IBM SYSTEM/360 is modular. You choose a basic
installation to suit your needs today. As your workload
increases, you simply add units. You cannot outgrow
the SYSTEM/360. It solves all your data problems
faster and it cuts computer costs.
There has never been a computer like the IBM
SYSTEM/360.

had a parallel grotesque situation had the
secretary of the Communist Party been
invited to appear on a similar programme
as an independent expert on the Soviet
Union, with all reference to his Com-
munist affiliation muzzled.
The second cleanskin who has also
been helping Butler is Jim Killen. Killen
flew to Melbourne last weekend to act
for the second time as a star performer
for Butler's League of Rights annual
dinner and “seminar” held at the Federal
Hotel, Melbourne.
The Liberal Member for Moreton has
had a long association with Eric Butler.
The Butlerite “bi-weekly”—“New Times”
constantly highlights Killen as a dedi-
cated anti-Communist, reprints his
speeches and extols his virtues. The
current “New Times” devotes three-
quarters of the whole issue to a defence
of Killen against “smears” and “un-
scrupulous character assassination”. Kil-
len was also financed by the League of
Rights to fly to the United Kingdom, to-
gether with Butler, in a desperate effort
by two “patriots” to offset Britain’s entry
into the Common Market.
In fairness to Killen. one should point
out that he has consistently denied any
anti-Semitic prejudices and never by
written word associated himself with But-
ler's anti-Semitic obsessions. He has con-
stantly maintained that his association
with the Australian League of Rights is
based on a common interest “in preserv-
ing British integrity”.
Killen has, rightly, never h en particu-
larly tolerant or lax with fellow-travellers
or fools allowing themselves to be used
as dupes in “Unity Tickets” or other
Communist fronts. He would do well to
apply this same formula consistently with
regard to his own close association with
the League of Rights. The fact that Killen
is now a member of the Parliamentary
Foreign Affairs Committee, and presum-
ably regards himself as a potential Cabi-
net prospect, should impel him to re-
consider the implications of his present
association. If he is too infatuated with
Butler’s charisma to extricate himself,
some of his political associates could well
consider giving him a prod. In the tong
run, a continuation of Killen's open asso-
ciation with the League of Rights could
have wider political repercussions on the
Liberal Party as a whole.
In the meantime Eric Butler must be
a very satisfied man. So long as he has
good allies like Norman Banks and Jim
Killen patronising him, his future is
fairly rosy. The Communist Party must
also gain comfort from all this. The
activities of Messrs Butler, Banks and
Killen provide them with superb propa-
ganda ammunition and enable them to
cast aspersions on all anti-Communists by
depicting them as active allies of the
hate pedlars and lunatic fringe.

The Corpse Business
By CHARLES HIGHAM
CBS Reports —The Great American
Funeral. Channel 2, Sydney.
Nehru: The Living Camera. Channel
9, Sydney.
Alfred Hitchcock Presents. Channel 7,
Sydney.
rp H E CBS report on the American
funeral business consisted mostly of
a series of deadpan interviews with mem-
bers of the clergy, morticians, and
Jessica Mitford, primly dismissive on a
Berkeley, California, garden seat. There
was far too little exploration of the
grotesque trappings with which business-
men across the Pacific, selling funerals
on the instalment plan from door to
door, surround the business of death, and
the best documentary passages were
those when the procession of coolly
selected muttonheads and hard sellers
disappeared from the frame and the
actual things they dealt in flashed like
wares in a kind of Macy’s for the dead
across the goldfish bowl. Wax tulips,
roses and lilies of the valley, Mantovani
playing to the dead on an outsize tele-
vision screen, rows of caskets in a variety
of prices from boxwood to polished ala-
baster, a display of bottles and jars with
“True-Tone Covering Cream” and a
mess designed to give a healthy suntan
to your dear departed uncle —all this
was good television, shockingly cut to-
gether into a chiaroscuro for necrophi-
liacs. And the commentary provided
a nice array of funeral euphemisms
(corpses become cremains, graveyard
keepers cremetarians) as well as quoting
a few good lines in funeral directors’
understatements: “Short sleeves do not
look good on a dead body,” said one
Dior of the Deceased as he lovingly con-
templated the latest fashion in slumber-
time wear. One anecdote —of a visit to
a house where a receptionist said that
the lady of the manor would receive her
guest, who was ushered into a bedroom
occupied only by a corpse—was worthy
of Nathanael West.
“The Living Camera”, sporadically
run by Channel 9, is perhaps the most
brilliant experiment to date in the not-
strictly-commercial American cinema. So
far we have seen “Jane”, in which the
series' technique—a hand-held camera
probing into corners, the sound-track
recorded “wild” —was unforgettably
shown off, examining a night of tension
before the opening of a Broadway flop,
Walter Kerr speeding to his office from
a hideous house in the suburbs to type
his review, and Jane Fonda, the star of
the fiasco, reading the reviews in anguish
in the early morning hours —all a splen-
didly far cry from the soap-opera fan-
tasies of “All About Eve”. “The Chair”
relentlessly upset another Hollywood
fantasy, the all-white, sleek prison where
hard-faced wardresses with hearts of
gold give the heroine a chance to wear
her lipstick to the hot seat. Here, Paul
Crump was seen in the death-cell, fur-
nished only by bunk and lavatory, the
word “Think” printed with an absurd
touch of theatricality over the death
chamber, and inside the Chair itself, as
disconcertingly harmless-looking as little
Miss Muffet’s tuffet (unlike the Luna
Park model of film legend, complete with
lights flashing on and off like a Broad-
way sign). “Nehru”, the last to be shown
here in the series, examined a sometimes
tired, sometimes perky figure, surrounded
by the waving stick-arms of his people,
his face sometimes lit by a shrewd, sly
humor that made him more likeable than
the rather fake-saintly figure one has
got used to in newsreels.
Alfred Hitchcock’s 1963 hour-long
series has turned up here at last: the
first episode, crisply written and played,
featured a hick vaudeville girl turned
murderous star, her unwanted ex, her
handsome new light-of-love and a Hedda
Hopper-like busybody columnist in its
cliche list of characters, but for some
reason came out as very good entertain-
ment. Much of the time Alice Pierce
brilliantly dominated the proceedings as
the columnist, flirting with the handsome
Hollywood males, sniping at the distaff
side, and in the last scene popping up in
a Mexican honeymoon hideaway with
the star’s friends screaming “Surprise,
surprise!” only to get her biggest scoop
of a lifetime by seeing the star and her
new husband dragging the former hus-
band’s corpse through the door.
Another series, “Theatre of Thrills”,
has started up on the same channel: we
are getting this week a Hollywood-
Oriental curio, “Daughter of the Dra-
gon”, and later “Mad Love”, Karl
Freund’s wonderful adaptation of “The
Hands of Orlac”, with Peter Lorre and
Colin Clive.

Holt. Recently at Capitol Theatre,
Sydney.
film version of “Beeket” follows
the letter of the play closely, and the
witty dialogue is a stimulating departure
from most historical film scripts. But
director Peter Glenville is less successful
in distilling the play's spirit.
He is often bewitched by pomp and
panoply, the mere physical trappings of
the historical drama (barely sketched in
in Anouilh’s non-realistic play) to the
extent of making the solid, realistic and
often beautiful backgrounds more im-
portant than the human beings in front
of them.
Richard Burton and Peter O’Toole ap-
proach their roles intellectually rather
than emotionally; one is always con-
scious of the actors behind the characters
in these intelligent, highly professional
but not genuinely moving performances.
Burton relies chiefly on his wonderful
voice, and makes the change in Beeket
too sudden to be convincing: the worldly
libertine overnight becomes a saint.
Peter O’Toole’s portrayal of the king is
more imaginative, but in the later se-
quences, after the loss of his friend, he
tends be shrill, petulant and flouncing:
more huffy than heartbroken.
In minor roles, Sir John Gielgud and
Martita Hunt give an object lesson on
making a good deal out of little.
Perhaps because of increasing num-
bers of imitators, Alfred Hitchcock has
lately been changing his style. More and
more he turns to the psychological
drama, leaving the genre in which he
is unrivalled the breakneck, wildly
exciting thriller in the less capable
hands of directors like Stanley Donen
(“Charade”) and Mark Robson (“The
Prize”).
In “Marnie” Hitchcock again dabbles
in psychological drama. Since his insight

into the human soul is by no means
profound, the result is poor psychiatry,
and, since this is a verbose and generally
humorless film, it’s poor Hitchcock;
neither a good shocker nor a rational
case history.
Marnie has troubles she’s a com-
pulsive thief and liar and is terrified
of sexual intercourse, thunderstorms and
the color red. (Whenever she sees it,
she and the whole screen turn red, too,
to show how bad she feels.) A terribly
decent, rich man marries her and at last
uncovers the awful secret of her past.
Without divulging the not too surprising
ending, I can tell you that Mamie's main
problem was that she needed love.
Tippi Hedren, a slim, dim blonde, ap-
pears as Marnie. Sean Connery seems
too concerned with not being James
Bond to have time to portray any other
character. There’s a really ripe piece
of bad acting from Louise Latham as
Mamie’s mother.
In fairness, it must be said that the
color photography is often charming,
and that the direction is generally
smooth though monotonous. But I never
expected to see in a Hitchcock film such
technical carelessness as in the ludi-
crously unconvincing riding sequences
especially the chase in which Tippi
Hedren’s hair streams in the wind, indi-
cating distraction, while the coiffure of
her pursuer Diane Baker remains com-
pletely unruffled.
In its early sequences, “Station Six
Sahara” is a taut psychological drama
the genuine article this time handled
with vigor and subtlety by Seth Holt, an
underrated minor director. But Mr Holt
has been inflicted with a plot and a star
which both appear halfway through the
film and turn it from dramatic realism
into romantic nonsense.
The first scenes acutely observe the
five men staffing a remote desert oil sta-
tion, and their reactions to their isola-
tion and to each other. In particular the
film builds up tension between a new-
comer to the station and the overbear-
ing, arrogant boss, the archetypal big
frog in a little puddle. Their growing
hostility and its explosion during a poker
game generates true suspense, thanks to
the director and actors Peter van Eyck
and Jorg Felmy.
But then in from the Sahara crashes
Carroll Baker, in white mink and a
white Mercury, with a trunkful of Pierre
Balmain clothes which she spends most
of her time removing. With her baby
voice and outmoded mane of platinum
hair, Miss Baker looks and acts like a
schoolgirl’s notion of a femme fatale;
and though Holt and his actors manfully
strive to preserve the harshly realistic
tone, the film degenerates from this
point on.

rriHELONious Monk and Pee Wee Rus-
-*• sell are both musicians of natural
integrity who have carved out inimitable
and highly original ways of playing their
respective instruments and both are genu-
ine eccentrics. Bringing them together,
without rehearsal, to play at last year’s
Newport Jazz Festival was a brilliant if
hazardous idea.
Monk’s 60-odd compositions, which
abound in unique harmonies, unconven-
tionally voiced chords and surprising
rhythmic twists, are simultaneously naive
and cynical, often beautifully simple, and
just as often so complex that other
pianists are unable to handle them. In-
terest never flags in these long rendi-
tions of the comparatively basic “Nutty”
and “Blue Monk”; the regular members
of the Quartet (Rouse, Warren and Dun-
lop) all solo with thorough understand-
ing of Monk’s music and Pee Wee con-
tributes magnificently, considering the
difficulties inherent in the situation. It is
Monk himself, however, who emerges as
the star of the session both in his solos
and in his harmonic and rhythmic feed-
ing of the other soloists.
The reverse side consists of four
esoteric tunes (including Monk's
“Straight, No Chaser”) recorded at New-
port’s Festival five years earlier., by the
Miles Davis Sextet, featuring the saxo-
phones of John Coltrane and Julian
“Cannonball” Adderley. This is an un-
seemly wrangle from start to finish.
“Ah-Leu-Cha” is a breakneck dog-fight,
a death-battle between the front-line pro-
tagonists with a shockingly over-
recorded drummer snapping at their
heels. Coltrane performs with his cus-
tomary anguish, spewing forth a sheet of
sound that is full of hate and ugliness;
and Davis, while not as funereal as he
can be, cancels many lyrical phrases with
weak notes. Adderley and Bill Evans
provide brief moments of comparative
sanity, but the sedate “Fran-Dance” is
the only track that is even listenable
throughout.
In 1961 the newly-formed Paul Winter
Sextet won an inter-collegiate jazz festival
competition, then climaxed a Latin-
American tour with an appearance at
the White House. Exploratory without
being self-conscious about it, this young
group could eventually make a fresh
contribution to modern jazz. Ensemble
passages reveal inventive thinking in the
use of the limited instrumentation and
solos are integrated with the whole con-
ception in a way that is too often
neglected by many a more mature band.
Two things worry me in the present


album: the unsuitability of some of these
folk songs as jazz vehicles even when
only used as a point of departure
(“Waltzing Matilda” for one), and the
soprano saxophone playing of the leader.
This recalcitrant member of the saxo-
phone family has seldom been mastered
(Sidney Bechet and Johnny Hodges are
two who can control it); Paul Winter
produces a sour, empty tone which
mars almost every track.
The integration anthem “We Shall
Overcome” is the most moving of the
twelve selections, but more excitement
is generated in two Brazilian songs
“Guantanamera” and “Aruanda”. The
eighteenth-century character of “Green-
wood Side” is cleverly preserved even
with the group swinging in a most futur-
istic manner; while “John Henry”, the
number closest to jazz in the album, loses
all jazz feeling in a sequence of cute
riffs. The concept of whole instrumental
versions of tunes which are invariably
sung has possibilities but, on the whole,
they are not realised here and I prefer
these songs the way they were meant
to sound.
TOM PICKERING
OPERA
Too Much Farce
Cosi Fan Tutte. Elizabethan Theatre,
Sydney.
11/fozAßT’s “Cosi Fan Tutte” was in
■ LTJ ‘ many ways the most successful of
the operas presented this season. Stefan
Haag’s fluent production was allied with
Desmond Digby’s chic sets in a perform-
ance whose stylishness and sophistication
matched well with its general musical
solidity.
However, Haag’s production weighs
the scale too heavily in favor of farce.
This is easy and very tempting to do,
especially as Mozart and his librettist,
da Ponte, have included a number of
more or less farcical touches. But “Cosi
Fan Tutte” is, in its individual way, a
serious opera as serious as “Don
Giovanni”. Where the subject of the
earlier opera is passion, the subject of
“Cosi Fan Tutte” is romantic love, which
it is able to make fun of precisely to the
extent that it takes it seriously. Too
much “business” draws laughs, but les-
sens the impact of the serious parts of the
opera. The lovers must not be made out
to be fools or buffoons. If they are, their
arias in the second act, for instance, lose
most of their point.
Apart from this, the production had a
pervasive air of preciousness and artifi-
ciality that was also rather at odds with
the opera. Instances of this were the
fussy and elaborate scene-changing rou-
tines carried out under Don Alfonso’s
supervision. This amounted to the pro-
ducer's telling the audience behind the
back of his hand that the entire work is
really very artificial, very amusing, very
18th century —which is merely to pander
to popular misconceptions about the
18th century (including the beliefs that
the 18th century and the Restoration
happened at the same time, and that
neither of these eras took itself seriously
or can be taken seriously today) and
to misjudge and diminish the stature of
one of the greatest of all operas.

ART
Lanceley’s Award
The Helena Rubinstein Travelling Art
Scholarship. Art Gallery of NSW.
{Ynce again we find a major art com-
” petition award given to an artist
whose work does not fit the conditions
exactly but who, nevertheless, provides
a strong entry. The Rubinstein commit-
tee is at least flexible on this point, in
giving Colin Lanceley the scholarship for
what is virtually sculpture. Lanceley’s
painting (or, rather, “piece”), which in-
cludes more paint than junk, is not of
the quality of some other paintings in
this show. However, the others with
their insistence on the third dimension,
especially “The Great Aviator”, reveal
Lanceley’s skill as an assemblagist with
a witty facility in the choice and arrange-
ment of unexpected found objects.
Given a purely sculptural competition
it is unlikely that this sort of thing
would be able to stand up at all to the
work of experienced craftsmen who
work wholly within one medium and
who would be able to visualise their
pieces from many points in space, not
just one. Perhaps Lanceley’s vigorous
entries might encourage the sponsors of
this scholarship to permit a year (pos-
sibly next, since the paintings have fallen
off quite a bit) in which only sculptors
be invited to enter. We have sculptors
but they need encouragement even more
than painters.
Rodney Milgate’s sensitive control is
evident in a large painting entitled
“Credenda”, where compartments of
well-balanced calligraphic form suggest
a worn Arabic manuscript.
Charles Reddington has travelled more
purposefully along the now familiar
Whiteley highway by tightening some of
his forms.
Texturalists Peascod and Lynn com-
plement each other, the one with thin,
vaporous evocations of cave, rock sur-
faces in reduced color, the other with
thick wrinkled bronzed paint and collage
close-ups of materially dense strata, earth
furrows and the like.
JOHN HENSHAW
THEATRE
Innocent Accused
The Deadly Game. James Yaffe. St
Martin’s Theatre, Melbourne.
F|urrenmatt's novel, “The Danger-
ous Game”, from which this play
has been adapted, can be read as a
superior thriller. There are points of
similarity with “The Marriage of Mr
Mississippi”. Gustave Kummer (“Sor-
row”), a retired prosecutor, holds that
every man is his brother’s murderer. If
you dig deep enough you will bare our
common guilt for which we may atone
only with the hangman’s aid.
The story, set in Switzerland, is built
round the trial of a stranger. One stormy
night Howard Trapp, an American sales-
man, blunders into a lonely chalet where
he is confronted by a bevy of ancients:
Emile, a former judge, Bernard, an erst-
while public defender, and Joseph, who
is a doddering ex-executioner. These
gentlemen spend convivial evenings re-
enacting famous trials, but they prefer
living subjects, and Trapp, who con-
siders himself an absolutely innocent
extrovert, is inveigled into joining the
sinister game as the accused. Before it’s
all over he feels far from innocent.
This is a shortish play and for most
of the time it hovers excitingly between
grim earnest and gallows-humor comedy.
The contrast of Trapp’s simple-minded
optimism against the well-fed disillusion
of his judge and accuser provides the
outer tension. Within and beneath moves
a dramatically straightforward but mor-
ally complex argument which, as always
with Durrenmatt, ends inconclusively but
which can be interpreted in an Existen-
tialist sense.
It is not a difficult work, and highly
entertaining. But Mr Yaffe, though fol-
lowing the story closely, has sharpened
the climaxes rather too much. Having
had to shorten the speeches of which
Durrenmatt is so fond even in the
theatre, and through amputating certain
intricacies, his Trapp is trapped easily
into self-incrimination. The second act
gallops to a denouement which is too
conventionally theatrical.
Irene Mitchell’s production is devas-
tatingly effective, helped by Paul Kath-
ner’s brilliant and cleverly-lit set. To in-
clude two German actors was a stroke of
genius. Max Bruch, as the advocate, per-
forms a tour-de-force unsurpassed on
local stages and Kurt Ludescher is per-
fectly cast as the senile hangman. Peter
Drake is an appallingly convincing
Kummer, down to the eager tilt of his
nose. Trapp’s part is the most difficult.
It might have been conceived more
flashily, but Jeffrey Hodgson does very
well in a rather boyish manner.

Billy Hughes’ Boswells
By M. H. ELLIS
William Morris Hughes. A Political
Biography. Vol. I: That Fiery Par-
ticle, 1862-1914. L. F. Fitzhar-
dinge. Angus & Robertson. 635.
The draughty halls of Parliament House
during the first years of the 1940 s
were haunted by a pale, small figure
equipped with a hearing aid who was
dubbed, by one nearly as august as he, as
“Pharaoh in search of his immortality”.
In short, William Morris Hughes on the
look-out for a biographer who would do
him clear justice.
Matters began to come to a head early
in World War II when Sir George
Knowles introduced him to Mr Fitz-
hardinge, a sombrely serious purveyor of
old-fashioned Australian history equip-
ped with all the marks of academic learn-
ing. They communed for a time ex-
perimentally, but after a few months the
war, or perhaps a failure to speak the
same idiom, parted them. And Billy
began rolling his own versions, as in
“Crusts and Crusades” (1946) and in the
ultimate “Policies and Potentates” (1949)
in which he related his heady adventures
with “giants of those days . . . seen face
to face . . . crossed swords with in hot
debate; and when the tumult and the
shouting died ... sat with in restful ante-
rooms”, with “fragrant cups of tea”.
During the creation of this master-
piece, in which he produced a “person-
ally conducted tour” that hurried the
reader “past many intriguing figures,
about whom my memory registers only a
vague blur”, Billy had taken to himself a
new Boswell, Farmer Whyte, doyen
of Canberra parliamentary journalists,
former editor of the “Daily Telegraph”
and the Brisbane “Daily Mail”.
And the enterprise with Whyte went on
until Billy was lured, in 1950, to a
meeting of the Royal Australian Histori-
cal Society in Sydney at which Mr Fitz-
hardinge reappeared, new armed, and
exposed for inspection the W. M. Hughes
of his colonial parliamentary days as he
saw him. He went back to Fitzhardinge.
On December 14, 1952, a few weeks
after Billy died, Fitzhardinge, now on
an equal footing with Whyte, announced
that he would finish a life of Hughes,
“which cannot help being controversial”,
in “anything from two to five years”.
He stated that his mission in biography
was the result of Hughes’ “urgent and
imperious summons to Parliament
House”, where in 1951 the great man
David Low’s Billy Hughes, 1919.
“rather to my surprise was extremely
flattering”, about his own extremely flat-
tering paper before the RAHS and “urged
me to drop everything else and devote
my full time to his biography”.
So Fitzhardinge had a flying start with
the blessing of Billy’s executors, first and
“unrestricted access”, so he said, to a
“number of trunks and tea chests of
papers”. The books laid heavily on
him. But with a surprising turn of
speed,, Farmer Whyte came home first,
flaunting an autographed introduction by
Billy which contained the wise saw
that “biography should hold a mirror
up to nature, and so portray the man in
all his moods and vicissitudes of his life
that readers may see and know what
manner of man he was”, as Boswell’s
life of Johnson does, not to mention
Plutarch’s Lives. This axiom Billy
crowned with his reflection that he had
“few illusions about myself”, but that
“my most venomous critic has never
charged me with stodginess”:
In my darkest hours I have contrived to
smile. And I like to think that, had per-
verse Fate not flung me into public life,
l should have made a quite good evange-
list.
|Te ended his homily with an injunction
to his portrayer, “Think of these
things, I pray you”—which, had it been
spoken, would no doubt have been utter-
ed in the tones of the founder of a new
religion sending forth his first apostle.
Whyte’s book came out in 1957 and
includes a pointed aside in a note on
Billy’s will that his “papers and docu-
ments, concerning which no specific
directions were given, have been pre-
sented to the National Library in Can-
berra”.
So far from finishing his work in
1954 or 1957, neck and neck with
Whyte as he had prophesied, Fitzhard-
inge was still, according to his own story,
wrestling his way through the Hughes
papers in 1958. He is now, six years
later, at page 302, half-way through his
task, passing the 1914 mark, and whet-
ting his readers’ appetite for more about
Hughes with the volume’s closing sen-
tence that, “The Great War brought him
(Hughes) the opportunity for which
no one else was so fitted by training,
experience, and character.” There will
be many who saw the subject in an
intimate context during the conscription
campaigns and at other times who would
look at that confident statement with
some doubt.
Farmer Whyte’s biography was com-
plete to Hughes’ death. He differed
from Fitzhardinge in that he was not
able to take him as research material saw
him, but as Hughes beheld himself and
his own adventures. He made little
attempt at analysis. On the whole, be-
cause of his sureness of touch, his story
gives a more crisp picture of Hughes, if
not as painstaking and detailed as Fitz-
hardinge’s, though it is hurried, some-
times not very accurate, matters which
are balanced by the advantage which
Whyte possessed of personal first-hand
knowledge and a lifetime of political
and parliamentary experience into which
the figure of Hughes was closely w'oven.
Fitzhardinge spent months in England
adding to Whyte’s (and Billy’s) autobio-
graphical trivia about his hero’s early
childhood days. And where Whyte often
takes Billy’s word for the impossible,
Fitzhardinge displays a puzzled look as he
records such facts as that Billy was actu-
ally born in 1862, whereas he always
maintained that he was born in 1864 —a
discovery which Billy’s devoted and
patient war-time secretary, Percy Deane,
discovered and inquired about, provoking
a gelignite blast of protest, “Gahd,
blithering blanky blazes, wasn't I there
when I was born?”
He seems equally astonished and bewil-
dered as he perceives Billy to have
been born in several different places,
and seems quite oblivious of the fact
that it was as natural to Billy to do in
Rome what the Romans would have
liked him to do, as it would have been
for him to drive his Romer car up a
bank or eat cold chicken for breakfast.
When among wharfies who knew all
about Liverpool as a spiritual home of
waterside agitation, would it have been
kind to have claimed any other city than
Liverpool as his place of origin? Would
the Welsh have appreciated his being
born anywhere but within sight and


AUSTRALIAN CONSOLIDATED INDUSTRIES LIMITED
Reg. Office: 500 Bourke Street, Melbourne, Victoria.
ADDRESS OF THE CHAIRMAN OF DIRECTORS (MR J. A. FORREST) AT THE
ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS ON WEDNESDAY, 16th SEPTEMBER , 7964.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
We have reached the stage in our proceedings
where, following the usual practice, 1 should like
to address you on the state of the Company's affairs
and on the results of the year just ended, but before
doing so would refer to the untimely death on 15th
April last of Mr. H. J. Quinn, one of the two Joint
General Managers of the Company. Shareholders are
already aware of this sad happening and will, I
know, wish to record their appreciation of his ser-
vices and their sympathy for his family. Mr. Quinn
had an outstanding career in the service of the
Company over a period of 41 years and he will
be greatly missed.
REVIEW OF ACCOUNTS
The 1964 Group Report including the Accounts and
Balance Sheet has been circulated and no doubt you
will have taken the opportunity of examining it.
The Net Group Profit for the year after providing
for income tax at rates known at the time the
accounts were closed off for the year was £3,279,000.
As Shareholders already know, Australian rates of
income tax for companies are now increased and,
as noted by the Directors in their Report, an
additional amount of £104,000 in total will be pay-
able by the Group Subsidiaries on the 1964 in-
comes, and has the effect of reducing the Net Group
Profit for the year to £3,175,000.
Other provisions as set out on page 16 of the
Report were made before determining the profit
for the year. The year's result compares with
£2,867,000 for the previous year and shows the
improvement expected when I mentioned last year
that the Company was looking forward to a better
year.
The proportion of income this year due to outside
shareholders in certain subsidiaries is higher than
it was for 1963 and reflects the improved results
achieved by those companies. As shareholders will
know, these companies are Malayan Containers
Limited where the Malaysian public has a substantial
interest and A.W.G. Holdings Proprietary Limited in
which Pilkington Brothers Limited and Pilkington
Brothers (Australia) Limited have substantial share-
holdings.
Transfers to Reserves this year by certain com-
panies in the Group amounted to a total of
£748,000 compared with £637,000 last year. Profits
remaining unappropriated over the Group amount
to £1,351,000. The Group General Reserves have
risen to £12,893,000.
SHAREHOLDERS' FUNDS
In the Consolidated Statement of Assets and
Liabilities, it will be noted that Shareholders' Funds
increased to £47,773,000 by the close of the year.
These Funds are substantial in relation to the total
of £66,380,000 employed in the business of the
Group. Increases in Shareholders' Funds during the
year came mainly from additions to reserves and
from profits not appropriated.
WORKING CAPITAL
Group Current Liabilities and Provisions at the
close of accounts stood at £13,556,000 and were
amply covered by Current Assets of £22,469,000.
During the year the Company made use of modest
amounts of bank overdraft and deposit moneys. The
total increase over the year in Debtors and Stocks—
£l,6ll,ooo—is partly a reflection of increased pro-
duction and sales throughout the Group and also
the continuing tendency by customers in some of
our industries to rely on us as bulk stockists.
investments
The total cost of investments at the close of the
year was £5,774,000 —an increase of £558,000 over
the previous year. The main part of this increase
is represented by shares taken up in:
(i) Fletcher Bernard-Smith Limited (£109,000) —
a new venture in which we have an equal
interest with Fletcher Holdings Limited and
operating in New Zealand in structural
steel and pressure vessel work;
(ii) Coramic (Australia) Pty. Ltd. (£90,000);
(iii) Harbison A.C.I. Pty. Ltd (£64,000); and
(iv) Chicago Bridge-Lennox Pty. Ltd. (£50,000),
and by the Company's one-h«lf interest with Pilk-
ington Brothers (New Zealand) Limited in the part-
nership of New Zealand Window Glass Company
(£178,000).
FIXED ASSETS
The total investment made in fixed assets during
the year was £5,044,000 and after taking deprecia-
tion into account, the figure for fixed assets on the
Consolidated Statement of Assets and Liabilities rose
to £38,136,000 on the close of the year's accounts.
Finance for this year's expenditure on these capital
items came from internal sources and the outlay was
less than it was on similar items in each of the
previous two years. The expenditure was devoted
mainly to expansion and modernisation of existing
facilities and has contributed towards combating the
persistent tendency for production costs to rise.
TAXATION AND DEPRECIATION
Earlier, I mentioned the effect which the increase
in Australian rates of income tax on companies
will have on the Group for the year just closed.
Clearly the new rates will affect the future net earn-
ings of the Group, but to what extent in the whole
picture no one can say because other factors will
also have their influence. Once again, the Govern-
ment has missed the opportunity to rectify an
anomaly in income tax law. I refer to depreciation
on income-producing buildings which is still not
an allowable deduction.
The Provision for Depreciation of Fixed Assets
this year was £3,144,000. A sum of £650,000 was
provided for increased cost of replacing fixed assets
bringing the total so set aside to £4,955,000.
N.Z. WITHHOLDING TAX
In June the New Zealand Government, in its
Budget proposals, announced a Withholding Tax
on dividends paid by New Zealand companies to
non-resident shareholders. This will affect A.C.I. to
the extent of 15 p.c. of the amount of any divi-
dends remitted by our New Zealand Subsidiaries to
Australia. Company rates of tax in the Dominion
are already higher than they are in Australia and
this added burden is most discouraging. At the
same time, it is fair to concede that withholding
tax is no novelty and New Zealand is only follow-
ing a taxation principle well established in other
countries, including Australia.
SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES
The year's activities in the Subsidiary Companies
have been reviewed by the General Manager in the
Published Report already circulated. It is not my
intention to go over his comments which are quite
comprehensive.
HEADQUARTERS BUILDING
Plans for the construction of a new headquarters
building on the land acquired last year at 550
Bourke Street, Melbourne, are advancing steadily.
The site clearing work is practically finished and we
hope soon to be considering construction tenders in
detail.
NEW ZEALAND
The general improvement in economic conditions
in New Zealand, noted when addressing you last
year, has continued and our Companies operating
in the Dominion showed increased business and
improved results compared with the previous year.
Our New Zealand operations have developed and
grown over the years and in order to provide more
local autonomy in administration, we recently
appointed Mr. C. McK. Cairns as General Manager
for A.C.I. Limited in New Zealand. He is respons-
ible, through the General Manager, to the Board
for the well being, growth and development of our
New Zealand Subsidiaries.
New Zealand Window Glass Company, in which,
as I have mentioned, we are partners with Pilking-
ton Brothers Limited (through their New Zealand
subsidiary), is now in production and making good
quality clear sheet glass. As we expected, it is
not yet a fully economic venture but its prospects
in time are sound and at this stage is showing the
results expected of it. Credit is due to the tech-
nical officers of Pilkington Brothers Limited for bring-
ing these works to the present degree of efficiency.
SOUTH EAST ASIA
In March this year, Mr. Haile and I visited South
East Asia. While there we inspected our factories
in Thailand and Malaysia and had interesting and
valuable discussions with Government officers and
with customers, suppliers and others with whom we
have business relations. We learned a good deal
at first-hand about the situation prevailing in those
parts, but as you all know the situation changes
rapidly and it is not easy to predict what business
conditions will be even a month or two ahead.
Thai Glass Manufacturers in Bangkok had a
successful year and so far in the current year
results have been satisfactory. Business in Thailand
has not been affected to the extent one might
expect in view of the troubles in the neighbouring
countries.
_ln Malaysia our Subsidiary, Malayan Containers
Limited, through its two Subsidiaries Singapore
Glass Manufacturers Company Limited and Malayan
Fibre Containers Limited, had a successful year in
overall terms but towards the end of the period,
business in Singapore was being adversely affected
by the loss of exports and by competition from
imports. This condition still exists and since the
end of the year, business has been affected by
social and political troubles in that area. Need-
less to say, we are maintaining very close contact
with the situation there and in South East Asia
generally.
FUTURE PROSPECTS
The first five months of operation by the sub-
sidiaries in the current financial year show an over-
all improvement both in sales and results compared
with last year. This is as could be expected in
view of the generally prosperous conditions obtain-
ing in Australia and New Zealand. However, we
have yet to feel the full effect of the recent basic
wage and other increases in company costs and
how far business generally will be affected by the
increases in personal and other taxes recently
announced. Rises in interest rates over the recent
past are also an indicator of a restriction on free
spending which will have its effect on business.
On the other hand, Australia's funds overseas are
at a buoyant level and prospects for another
successful year of export business in primary pro-
ducts, minerals and manufactured goods, are bright.
Internally, the national economy is in good con-
dition with all the indications of continued steady
growth. However, management everywhere in
Government, Industry, Commerce and in primary
production - will need to intensify its efforts to
improve efficiency and control rising costs.
In A.C.I. constant efforts are being made to this
end. Company officers with technical skills in the
various industries in which we are engaged make
frequent visits overseas to ensure that they keep
abreast of latest developments. In addition, the
General Manager and I are in regular communica-
tion with our overseas associates and during the
last few months we had discussions in England and
subsequently I conferred with our associates in the
United States. We have also had the great advant-
age of visits from Senior Officers of some of our
overseas associates and we expect other visits in
the near future. I am sure you will all agree that
these activities are vitally important to the future
prosperity of the Company.
Taking the short view results so far this year are
better than last year's and we are looking forward
to the results of the whole year with cautious
optimism. Taking the long view we have no real
doubts about our prospects for the future.
VOTE OF THANKS TO STAFF
Following the death of Mr. Quinn, to which I
referred earlier in this address, Mr. George Haile,
who was Joint General Manager with Mr. Quinn,
was appointed General Manager of the Company
and its Subsidiaries. The Board would like to
record its appreciation of the way in which he,
with the able assistance of the Chief Executive
Officers of the various divisions, has taken up his
responsibilities.
In addition, all the men and women employed in
the Group's enterprises in Australia and overseas
have rendered loyal and competent service in
making the year just closed a successful one. On
your behalf, Ladies and Gentlemen, and on behalf
of the Directors, I wish to thank them.

lieus of old Westminster in sight of the
Victoria Tower?
Again, Mr Fitzhardinge seems to find
himself fazed as he pursues the great
man on his early travels through the
Australian wilds, and ponders on
such problems as whether Billy could
have droved so many thrashing long-
horns on his rearing bronco, or exactly
when the wild Kamilrois menaced him
through the Maronoa with their savage
war-cries—as I remember them from
my youth in the regions he frequented,
“Baccy, gibbit tjugar, tea, boss!”
But then Mr Fitzhardinge’s view is
always through his binoculars. He has
never sat (for instance), as I have sat,
amid Billy’s entourage at “piccaninny
daylight” on an Ipswich morning, while
Billy, shirt tail hanging out of his pyjama
pants, fortified himself for an encounter
with the powers of evil called Ryan and
Theodore on the morrow, by indulging
in his idea of “a quiet game of crib-
bage”. He has never seen a cribbage
board go flying as Billy demonstrated
how he flung himself into the Kin Kin
giant stinging tree, a whisker ahead of
the 12ft snake on which he had inadver-
tently trodden. He has never viewed
the calm insouciance with which Billy
could retrieve a flying cribbage board
and insert his own peg eight holes in
advance of where it was before. He has
never walked of an evening through the
horse-dung and carbide-scented air to-
wards a sputtering figure in the white
glare of the acetylene lights; a figure
sending up atomic mushrooms of sound
towards high heaven, his talons alter-
nately reaching for the Pleiades and com-
ing down thump, thump, thump on a bor-
rowed table. And he has never heard
harsh corncrake sound, man-size beside
the tiny figure that emitted it, ballooning
into bell-like tones on the challenge:
“Consistent, be-ruther? Have I not been
consistent? What did I say in Balmain
in 1889?” and the inevitable reedy and
echoing interjection from the region of
strategic retreat out on the edges of
the restless sea of tossing human silhou-
ettes: “Any umbrellas to mend?”, merg-
ing into the ominous growl of Billy’s
claque.
Billy was the “fiery atom” that the
“Daily Telegraph” christened him, but
Mr Fitzhardinge’s large, sombre aca-
demic paragraphs and lengthy quota-
tions, sometimes running into two pages
or more, have reduced his blaze to a
smoulder and flattened out his subject’s
riotous political naughtiness into decor-
ousness under their discursive weight.
Billy’s official biographer is obviously
more anxious not to do him wrong than
to do him full justice. He finds difficulty
in believing that Billy could possibly
have designed to pack the High Court
when he appointed Charles Powers, a
solicitor, and A. B. Piddington to its
august bench. He makes the extra-
ordinary political gymnastic display
which gave Billy the possession of the
1909-10 coal strike while its rightful
owner, poor Peter Bowling, was exhibited
on railway stations in chains like an
Anglian slave, looking, against the back-
ground of the realities, like a formal
exercise in calisthenics before a Dorcas
Society meeting. And Billy’s lightning
changes of front and attitude in the
matter of the wicked Coal-Shipping Vend
assume, under Mr Fitzhardinge’s hand,
the look of a statesman-like exercise in
ministerial propriety.
To view Billy in these contexts, Mr
Fitzhardinge was not the right man since
he knew him, as his biographer-in-con-
tact, only as an extinct volcano from
which an odd puff of warmth emerged
at long intervals.
To really appreciate his turgidity, his
magnetism and his willpower, his fero-
city in attack, his dexterity and the con-
suming power of the blithering blazes
of his lightning when it struck, one
needed to be on “the receiving end”.
A satisfying biography of W. M.
Hughes still has to be written but it
never will be, because the truth about
him was more a matter of telepathic
communication and personal touch and
perception than of any record left be-
hind in print.
Shoddy Conflict
The Curragh Incident. James Fergus-
son. Faber and Faber. 51s.
The Drums of Kumasi. Alan Lloyd.
Longmans. 31s.
Qince the end of Cromwell’s regime it
has been an article of faith in Bri-
tain that the Army does not play at poli-
tics. There was, however, one notable
occasion when the comfortable assump-
tion that soldiers were completely apoli-
tical animals received a hearty jolt. This
was the Curragh Incident in March,
1914, when 58 cavalry officers stationed
in Ireland chose dismissal from the Army
rather than face the possibility of armed
operations against the Ulster Unionists.
A good deal of nonsense has been
written about the so-called “mutiny” at
the Curragh camp near Dublin.
Accounts, often fiercely partisan, contra-
dictory or merely obtuse, crop up in the
memoirs of military and civilian figures
concerned in it. Sir James Fergusson’s
book is by far the best guide to the affair
so far published. The author has had
the advantage of drawing on the private
papers of his father, who, as a divisional
commander at the Curragh, filled one of
the key roles on the stage. He has had
access to important unpublished docu-
ments in the royal archives, and he has
sifted the recollections of some of the
surviving participants with exemplary
fairness. The result is a soundly-based,
lucid and extremely well-written book.
It is hard to imagine now the passions
aroused by the determination of
Asquith’s Liberal Government to push
through a Home Rule Bill for Ireland
in 1914. The Ulster Unionists, with
Carson breathing fire and slaughter at
their head, were openly arming to resist
rule from Dublin. Most of Europe, and
many Englishmen, believed that Ireland
was fast sliding into civil war, a war in
which the British Government would be
committed to the task of coercing “loyal”
Ulstermen into accepting the domination
of southern Irish “rebels”.
The chain of events leading to the
Curragh Incident began when Sir Arthur
Paget, commander-in-chief of the forces
in Ireland, was ordered to forestall the
risk of Unionist raids by strengthening
the Army’s military depots in Ulster.
Fully aware of the Tory sympathies of
some of his subordinates, the War Office
instructed Paget that officers whose
homes were in Ulster might be excused
from this duty if they desired. (They
were to be allowed to “disappear from
Ireland”, according to the curious official
phrase.) Other officers who declined to
serve in Ulster were to be warned that
they would be dismissed from the service
without any opportunity to resign their
commissions.
The transfer of a few extra regiments
to Ulster was really a very minor opera-
tion, and the Incident would probably
never have occurred but for the ham-
handedness of Sir Arthur Paget. The
commander-in-chief was an elderly war-
horse of limited intelligence but having a
fine sense of drama. When he returned to
Dublin from the War Office he man-
aged to convey the impression to his
senior officers that all Ireland was likely
to be “ablaze” within a few days and
that large-scale military activities in
Ulster were imminent. The upshot was
that Brigadier Hubert Gough, com-
mander of the cavalry brigade at the
Curragh, and more than 50 junior offi-
cers declared that they would accept

dismissal sooner than take part in “active
operations” in Ulster.
The matter was finally settled amid a
welter of recriminations and buck-
passing, but not before it had involved
the resignations of the Secretary of State
for War and the Chief of the Imperial
General Staff. Gough and his supporters
did not lose their commissions, and cer-
tainly Gough's career did not suffer be-
cause of his leading part in the affair.
The Curragh Incident has sometimes
been described in inflated terms as an
epic conflict of loyalties. Fergusson’s
book leaves the impression that there
was a rather shoddy side of it, too.
There were no conflicts of loyalties
among the simple soldiers who fought
Britain’s minor wars all over the world
in Queen Victoria's days. The troops
who marched with Sir Garnet Wolseley
through the Ashanti jungle knew their
duty and did it—while Sir Garnet him-
self, borne shoulder-high in his Madeira
cane chair by naked bearers, “waved
his cigar and smiled cordially at his
men’ as they went into action.
“The most horrible war I ever took
part in”, was how Wolseley described
the campaign against King Kofi Kari-
kari in 1873-74. It was certainly one
of the most bizarre in British colonial
history, and Alan Lloyd does full justice
to the gruesome story. However, it
would be good to have a voice from the
ranks to supplement the accounts of the
famous correspondents, Winwood Reade
and H. M. Stanley, who accompanied
the expedition to Kumasi. What did
they think of it all, those undernourished
townies and country bumpkins who filled
the Queen’s regiments? Their stoicism
was astonishing, their hardships almost
unbelievable. But (pace Kipling’s
jingles) they remain as mute as the
legionaries of Caesar.

Creative Powers
The Act of Creation. Arthur Koestler.
Hutchinson. 535.
all the discussions about the “two
cultures" still ringing in our ears, it
is rather a novelty to find a book which
points out that the artist and the scientist
have more in common than perhaps we
imagined. “In the popular imagination
these men of science appear as sober,
ice-cold logicians, electronic brains
mounted on dry sticks. But if one were
shown an anthology of typical extracts
from their letters and autobiographies,
with no names mentioned, and then
asked to guess their profession, the like-
liest answer would be: a bunch of poets
or musicians of a rather romantically
naive kind,” writes Arthur Koestler. In
this book he shows a common pattern
working in all forms of creativity.
Koestler has found it necessary to
divide The Act of Creation into two
parts. Book One deals with “The Jester”,
The Sage and The Artist , and ex-
plores the nature of humor, scientific
discovery, and creation in the arts. Book
Two has the title Habit and Originality”
and is meant to supply a more scientific
structure to the author s arguments and
give “support to the controversial
theories of creative activity outlined in
Book One’.
In starting with humor he also declares
his main argument. He states that we
may quickly burst into laughter when,
for instance, a person, accepted naturally
in one context, is suddenly seen in a
new way. A pompous school teacher is
transformed into a clown squatting on
the floor because some boys in his class
have partially sawn through the legs of
his chair. The teacher is seen from a
new angle for he is also a clown. And
so two conditions which were once
foreign are found to be the same, and
the boys laugh. Koestler claims that here
we have the basis of scientific and artistic
discoveries: the scientist and the artist
create by seeing analogies where people
have not seen them before; and Koestler
calls these moments of perception the
“bisociative process”. However, motives
vary: “The humorist’s motives are
aggressive, the artist’s participatory, the
scientist’s exploratory”,
Both the scientist and the artist, when
they are in the throes of creative think-
ing, are exploring “the deeps, without any
obvious guidance”. And in doing so they
both discard their conventional approach

toward reality, so that they may perceive
their new and startling analogies. The
emotions play their part in both spheres
of creativity, though some people may
believe that the artist’s role is far more
emotional than the scientist's. Koestler
refers to “the Eureka act” when speaking
of scientific discovery, in an attempt to
show how much the scientist must break
through “the habitual rules of the game”
so that he may make his discoveries.
Koestler emphasises the non-rational
forces underlining creation the mo-
ments when the mind is suddenly free
to grasp relationships which were pre-
viously hidden. The “bisociative process”
is at the centre of our ability to acquire
new knowledge: “Learning then, in the
most general sense of the word, consists
in putting two and two or A and B to-
gether.” He also finds the “bisociative
process” operating in the animal king-
dom, and its arch-enemy is Pavlov, or any
condition that tends to inhibit a creature
with habit and take away the opportunity
for initiative.
He is mostly concerned with common
ground and gives little attention to the
areas where the artist and the scientist
diverge: “The difference between the two
in objective verifiability is a matter of
degrees, and arises only after the act;
the act itself is, in both cases, a leap
into the dark, where scientist and artist
are equally dependent on their fallible
intuitions.” This, I feel, is a limitation of
the book. I assume that many scientists
would think that any excessive concentra-
tion on the irrational side of their work
would only falsify a full appreciation of
their world a world of testing, counter-
testing and objectivity. In fact, objectivity
is generally a significant aspect of the
artist’s task also.
In this book a fundamental and simple
idea has been expanded over many pages.
Countless examples are used to show that
creation is based on the wedding of
opposites the instance when the artist
and the scientist discover that “the fire
and the rose are one”. I a mleft with the
impression that the author has been un-
necessarily verbose and could have cut
down on quite a large amount of the
material without much harm to the core
of the book: through trying to be all-
embracing he has become monotonously
repetitive. Book One is presented in a
clear and almost hypnotic style, and
Koestler goes on and on hammering away
at the same points. A number of “Sum-
maries” throughout the volume help the
reader to collect his wits and prepare
again for the next weight of material.
And yet, after all has finished, it is
difficult to believe that anything unique
has finally been established. What is left
is an excessively comprehensive picture
of how the artist and the scientist ex-
perience their inspired moments. The
reader may admire Koestler’s perform-
ance but must be forgiven if all he can
say is, “Yes, that’s quite right. But, so
what?”
This, of course, is an age in which we
must go back to, and explore, the basic
reasons why things occur; it is an age
in which books about art are part and
parcel of our experience, and are read
and considered while the actual art re-
mains neglected. There appears to be a
great demand for such books, perhaps
because they seem to be a more direct
means to self-knowledge than through the
ambiguities of art although there are
things which “I too much discuss Too
much explain”. “The Act of Creation”
has value, it is interesting, and it reflects
ingenuity, and yet there remains the
embarrassing and pertinent temptation to
ask why Koestler did not write a novel
instead.
R. A. SIMPSON
Byron
Byron the Poet. M. K. Joseph. Gol-
lancz. 61s.
T>yron criticism is notorious for the
difficulty it has in cutting loose from
Byron biography. The difficulty can be
measured by the fact that even such a
determined critic as Professor Joseph
quite frequently falls into the bad old
ways of blurring critical issues with
“Notes and Queries” information about
the life. This is particularly true of the
earlier, inferior chapters of his study,
on “Childe Harold” and the Tales. Here
there is abundance of pre-critical
material about the poems—which sec-
tions were based on experience, what
Byron added and left out, what Byron
said about the poems in letters, and how
long it took him to write them —every-
thing but analysis and assessment of the
poetry itself.
The most glaring instance of Pro-
fessor Joseph’s failure, in the early
chapters, to come to grips with the poe-
try, is the section entitled, “The Spen-
serian Stanza”. There is some quietly
interesting general discussion here about
the related influence on Byron of
eighteenth-century Spenserianism and
Ariostan romance, the potentialities of
the Spenserian stanza, but at no point
does Professor Joseph get down to illu-
strating and examining Byron’s own use
of the stanza in “Childe Harold”.
As far as ‘‘Childe Harold” and the
Tales are concerned, the fact of the
matter would seem to be that Professor
Joseph hasn't very much new to say.
He evidently has nothing at all to say,
or considers that there’s nothing worth
saying, about the shorter lyrics, as these
are omitted altogether from this “general
study”. He has, on the other hand, a
great deal that is of interest to say about
“Don Juan”—the subject of the whole
second part of the book. A superficial
reading of the second part of this book
might suggest that Professor Joseph is
simply setting himself up as a Baconian
bell to summon the wits of “Don Juan”
criticism together. Further study reveals
that this is certainly not the case. Fre-
quent use is made of earlier criticism:
but the insights of such writers as
Lovell, Rutherford and Escarpit are assi-
milated into a critical account of the
poem which goes further than any that
has yet appeared.
There are, obviously, two major and
related critical questions to be asked
about “Don Juan”: how far do its
chameleon ironies and manifold perspec-
tives add up to a unified vision, and
has the deliberate bad taste of the poem
a serious artistic function? One goes a
long way towards getting satisfactory
answers to these questions in Professor
Joseph's study.
“Don Juan” shares with many other
great works of literature the quality of
being self-reflective: it is, amongst other
things, “a poem about itself”. Within
the framework of its narrative illusion,
it contemplates and insists upon its own
character as artifact. The literary “bad
taste” of the poem, its indecorous
rhymes, its multiple and bathetic similes,
its jaunty commentary on its own de-
vices, etc., have affinities with Brechtian
techniques in that the flippancy about
art and its conventions is a concomitant
of a fundamental seriousness about, and
moral contemplation of, human life and
its conventions and predicaments.
In discussing the love-theme of the
poem. Professor Joseph shows that the
romantic adventures of “Don Juan” are
not simply a string of titillating episodes,
but are differentiated in a way which
gives the poem a moral direction.
All this, together with Professor
Joseph’s ample demonstration of the
Chaucerian richness and variety of
characterisation and narrative in the
poem, the very full analysis of the sub-
stance of the poetry (which makes a
surprising contrast with the critical thin-
ness of the first part of the study),
leaves one with a new respect for Byron.

BUSINESS AND FINANCE
Sir Warren’s Red Light
With share markets falling, labor costs rising, higher
interest charges, tighter credit and an imports
problem, the Press conference covering the release
of the annual accounts of the Commonwealth Banking
Corporation on September 15 tended to be more inquisitive
about future trends rather than past history.
The chairman, Sir Warren McDonald, skilfully parried
questions about Reserve Bank policy and suggestions of
possible future restrictions, yet the housing section of the
annual report (while patting itself on the back for high
loan approvals on housing) had a plaintive note.
It gave the impression that some restraints were
expected. It said that, if measures to reduce the strain on
the building industry become necessary, they should not
be carried almost entirely by the housing sector, which
strongly aids consumer spending, particularly in industries
which have been hard hit in recent years.
Of course, Sir Warren was careful to express confidence
in the future. When pressed, though, he admitted the warn-
ing signs were flashing. While claiming it was not possible
for the banks to know about any impending tightness of
credit, he said there were pressures developing on labor
and costs. These evidently prompted him to make the
special plea for housing.
In 1961, he said, the brunt fell on the housing sector
and practically every sawmill closed up. For this reason,
he suggested that some efforts should be made to damp
down building activities which do not have a high priority.
He refused, when his arm was twisted, to admit that
industrial building was non-essential, although he claimed
that some buildings could wait another year. His theme
was that housing should be maintained and industrial
building, if required for manufacture or export projects,
should be encouraged.
Although the Reserve Bank has urged some restraint in
housing finance, the Commonwealth Banking Corporation
evidently believes that last year’s investment of £s9m. in
housing loans (through the Commonwealth Savings Bank)
should be maintained in 1964-65 and that it is better to
catch up on the back-log of home demands than to
finance less essential building projects.
Are We Wasting Selective
Import Opportunities?
rising trend in imports suggests that the composition
of those imports should be examined critically. The
purchase of virtually non-essential consumer goods could
prove to be folly.
Australia’s import strength should be directed to build-
ing up the productive power of Australian industry by
importing capital goods and materials not available locally,
says Mr R. W. C. Anderson, Director of the Associated
Chambers of Manufactures of Australia. He is quite
right, particularly when he says that Australia must not
dissipate its industrial growth capacity by splurging on too
many imported consumer goods.
If Australia can afford to import (with overseas balances
bloated by a favorable flow of investment capital), the
sensible policy is to import machinery which will improve
efficiency and induce greater competitive skill.
The Devil You Know
in Investment
Overseas investors do not always agree with Australia’s
blind faith in growth prospects. A comment on
Mount Isa Mines in the London “Statist”, September 11
issue, says that Australian buyers are not concerned with
the meagre 1.2 p.c. yield on Mt Isa, although Australians
were a little shaken to find that, because of higher costs
and depreciation, consolidated net income of this lead
and copper producer for 1963-64 was lower, despite pro-
duction records. The London commentator, although
certain that Australians would continue to support Mount
Isa, said he would prefer to go for high yielding Rhodesian
stocks like RST or Nchanga.
The point about this is that Australians are not inter-
nationally minded in comparing investment prospects and
they would prefer to stay close to home. There are too
many complications and tax problems tied up with over-
seas investment.

is still very much locally owned. But the holdings of those

other 18.000 shareholders might make interesting reading.
Compared with the heavy US buying of BHP in 1960, the
trend in US holdings probably has waned, as plenty of large
parcels are known to have been re-sold on the market when
the Americans lost some of their early enthusiasm.
Today, the huge size of BHP’s capital of £113,056,680
needs a bit of overseas support to cope with the regular weekly
turnover of 40,000 to 50,000 shares as normal sales reach
the market, lhe paid up capital needs wide buying interest
because it is three times the size of the next largest company
(ICIANZ, which will have more than £37m. issued after its
current purchase of Australian Fertilizer shares).
The size of BHP’s capital presents a king-sized problem in
handling the 100,000 dividend cheques posted each half year,
with the master share register in Melbourne needing to keep
track of all shareholders listed in each capital city of Australia
(plus London) and a large volume of transfers being processed
continually. So, since November, 1963, dividends have been
processed by a computer at the Newcastle steelworks.
The calculating, printing, sorting of addresses and enveloping
of dividend cheques is done automatically in a major operation
that now includes provision for magnetic imprint of signatures
and account identification soon to be introduced by banks.
If We’d Known You
Were Coming ...
in industry sometimes follow an overseas pattern and
the latest surprise in the takeover trend is in the cake and
cake-mix market. London surveys show that the market for
branded and pre-packed cakes sold through non-bakery out-
lets is likely to expand rapidly. UK experience has shown
that the current £stg!2sm. a year market for cake and cake
mixes has jumped by 20 p.c. in quantity in the past five years
and is twice the size of the market for frozen foods, three
times as big as margarine, and a much bigger market than
soap powder.
In the light of such impressive figures, it is no surprise to
note that J. Lyons & Co., largest maker of cakes in the UK,
is trying to protect itself from newcomers and is attempting
to revitalise the old image and bring modern, streamlined
methods into cake making and marketing, even with a view to
export.
Cadbury, with a vital expansion programme, has gone into
cake making in a big way and is running second to J. Lyons &
Co. In the UK, with relatively
small problems in transport,
the specialised retail baker’s
shop (with bakery attached)
still handles about half the cake
trade, but sales to grocers are
growing rapidly, along with the
bulk buying of variety chains
which are handling about 20
p.c. of the trade.
If the share of the cake
market held by independent
bakers continues to decline at
the present rate, there appears
to be great scope for expanding
the sales of those big manu-
facturers who can supply brand-
name products of consistent
quality in attractive, hygienic
containers.
The cake and cake-mix busi-
ness in Australia does not neces-
sarily follow the overseas pat-
tern of independent bakeries. It
seems, however, that the larger
Unemployed Applieants and Unfilled Vaeaneies

demand for skilled workers, is discussed in an article on this

producers will be watching their flanks very keenly in what
must be a potentially large growth market out here. Herbert
Adams Holdings Ltd, Melbourne, is claimed to be the largest
in Australia, followed by Westons.
The big chain store groups would be expected to have an
important influence in Australia. Transport problems imme-
diately come to the fore, particularly if daily baking of fresh
cakes is required. Nevertheless, overseas groups already have
indicated an interest in the expanding Australian market.
More Action Required on
Skilled Labor
'C'xtremely vocal attention continues to be drawn to Aus-
tralia’s shortage of skilled workers. Delays in coming to
proper grips with the problem do little credit to the three
parties principally concerned —Governments, industry and the
trade unions.
It can scarcely be expected that the latest meritorious
advances in overall factory efficiency can be repeated for long,
unless they are founded upon a contribution from labor skills
as well as on a better deployment of capital.
On economic grounds, too, with so much chatter about in-
flationary dangers lurking just around the corner, manufac-
turers could not help stability much by being forced to bid
up the price for a scarce resource, labor.
The changed position is clearly illustrated on the accompany-
ing graph. And most authorities concede that the reservoir
of skill seems practically exhausted.
Many Western industrialised nations are experiencing this
same phenomenon. They appear, though, to have speeded
up plans to provide vocational training for skilled operatives
more quickly than Australia.
Speaking to an Institute of Management convention, the
national secretary of the Australian Metal Industries Associa-
tion, Mr D. G. Fowler, put the matter bluntly: “The demands
made by technological progress and industrialisation for skilled
labor are not met by post-war training methods. Although
the shortage of trained operatives has been in evidence in Aus-
tralia since World War 11, we continue to rely on the same
sources of supply as we did a generation ago—viz., apprentice-
ship, elevation (from semi-skilled to tradesman status), and
migration.”
Rather desperate pleas to stop the “white collar drift” away
from apprenticeship come from the Metal Trades Employers’
Association, which sees a taper-
ing-off in the percentage of 15-
year-old boys willing to learn
a trade.
One optimistic note was
struck last week by the National
Bank’s monthly summary. The
Bank, examining population
trends, suggests that “one of the
main probabilities to emerge is
a higher per annum increase in
the workforce in the years im-
mediately ahead”. This does not
mean a proportionately greater
supply of skilled workers.
The National even displays
optimism on the chances of
lifting productivity without ex-
cessive inflation. Nevertheless,
there remains every case for
Government, employers and
trade unions to get together
soon on the immediate, and
ticklish, labor supply.


“CROESUS”
Professor in the Provinces
Defending Mr Bolte’s tax proposals
A pologists for Mr Bolte’s income tax
proposal are few and far between.
It is significant that among them one
finds R. I. Downing, the Richie Professor
at Melbourne University, and his argu-
ments must command respect. Indeed,
academic economists in Australia have
always so strongly favored the principle
of uniform taxation that, clearly, their
present doyen deserves to be taken
seriously when he says the Premier must
be congratulated for taking* “a most con-
structive step in the development of
Commonwealth-State financial relations”.
The suggestion is that what must rival
in unpopularity the payroll tax, of which
he is the reputed father, is also his brain
child, or at any rate that it had his
approval before it was broached in
Bolte's Budget speech. Downing has
even expressed the hope that other
States will follow the Victorian Premier’s
lead.
Downing has made it clearer than the
Premier has done so far that what is
required is not “a more generous tax
reimbursement from the Commonwealth,
but the establishment of a new freedom
for the States to tax in fields now re-
served to itself by the Commonwealth”.
In his view “the States should have a
margin of financial independence so as to
leave them free to develop and extend
their own regional economies”. He
thinks this would give more scope to the
initiative of State Ministers and civil ser-
vants, and permit each State to put its
own individual stamp on its development
and welfare policies. In a word, Down-
ing may seem to be speaking very much
as a professor in the provinces. But
he is not alone among provincials in
thinking that, threatened as they are by
Canberra’s tight hold on their purse
strings, the States should turn new de-
vices to finance their expanding services
and to promote economic and social
development.
JDefore rejecting this line of thought
too hastily, it should be said that
Downing acknowledges fully (as an
economist would have to) that “for suc-
cess in overall management of the econo-
my it is essential that the bulk of revenue
collection should be under the control of
a single policy-making authority, which
can only be the Commonwealth Govern-
ment”. Also, in supporting the proposal
for a State income tax, he makes the im-
portant proviso that the rate imposed
must not exceed a prescribed maximum,
which would be determined by the Com-
monwealth. That is, the States imposing
their own income tax must accept a uni-
form tax assessment Act and it must be
left to the Commonwealth to act as tax
collector on their behalf.
The first of these provisos has not
been mentioned by Mr Bolte, but all
along he has insisted the rates would be
marginal, that he doesn’t want to disturb
the present tax reimbursement arrange-
ment, and that the Commonwealth would
have to collect the tax. In turning to the
income tax field, he has said the only
equitable way to get the additional re-
venue he will need next year, mainly
for “education and hospitals”, is to get
it from income tax rather than through
any heavier imposts in the small number
PROF. R. I. DOWNING
of sectional tax fields still available to the
States. To emphasise his point he has
posed the question whether it was
fairer, say, to levy a land tax on homes
or to have State income tax.
The question has fundamental impli-
cations because, as far as one has ever
heard, there is nothing in principle which
distinguishes a tax on income from most
of the other taxes imposed by the Com-
monwealth, except probate. In one way
or another they all have a link with
current income at one or more removes.
Indeed, this may be said of land tax
(remember the theories of Henry George
which see this as the only tax that
need be imposed!), though Mr Bolte
seems to have missed the point that an
occupied house does in fact yield income
and that income is taxed in some coun-
tries, for example the Schedule A Assess-
ments in Britain.
All that has happened in respect of
uniform taxation is that the Common-
wealth has taken unto itself, mainly by
fortuitous circumstances such as war, it
may be noted, certain tax fields (income
and company tax in particular), which
it has clung to, so far without effective
challenge from the States who, in their
innocence, were sold on Federation by
the ticket that the only tax the Federal
Government would raise would be on
customs and excise. This has left the
States with a mere motley of fringe fields
which, even if reaped to the roots and
with tax reimbursements (diluted for the
benefit of less attractive States) thrown
in, bear no logical relationship to the
financial strains imposed on the most
populous and most rapidly developing
States.
VTow Mr Bolte is asking that, without
infringing the basic principle or the
practice of redistribution of income tax
from the more affluent States in favor of
the poorer ones, the Commonwealth
should share the field of income tax —the
first field which would, as a result of the
proposal, be shared (though some people
may see little difference between a stamp
duty and sales tax on motor vehicles,
the one imposed by the States and the
other by the Commonwealth). This is the
Bolte proposal’s great point of departure
from the present principles and practice
in Australian taxation. For my part, given
the safeguards outlined by Professor
Downing, I see no fundamental reason
for rejecting it on points of principle.
In practice, one would say that its
feasibility mainly depends on the margin
of availability of presently untaxed
capacity in the incomes of Victorians,
though not on this alone. For instance,
one has to take into consideration the
likely needs of the Federal Government
next year, not only its own needs for
defence and the rest of national require-
ments of tax revenue via tax reimburse-
ments. It could be that, given the main-
tenance of the standard of living and
the accepted need to maximise savings
next year, Victorian incomes will be
taxed up to the hilt by the imposts of
the Federal Government. In that case,
on Professor Downing’s hypothesis, the
Commonwealth would have to declare
that the margin of taxable capacity avail-
able in Victorian income would be nil.
If the main fears in other States are
that Mr Bolte’s ideas may prove to be
contagious and they put the system of
redistribution of tax revenue to the less
affluent States in jeopardy, in Victoria
their thrust is seen directly at people's
purses at a time when only the rich are
believed to have a margin of taxable
capacity to spare


ECONOMICS ANONYMOUS
Elusive Figures for Capital Inflow
Trying to reconcile a multitude of items
As usual after the spring meal of the
** annual balance of payments figures,
the full offering by the Commonwealth
Statistician for the year to June 30 has
left one with an empty feeling. True,
some of the courses were satisfying after
the meagre fare of the recent parliamen-
tary statement, but again one has to go
hungry for details of the real inflow of
capital into Australia. Moreover, the
full six months figures for the half-year
to December last have the same gaps in
the information on capital inflow. So
there is still little more than rule-of-
thumb estimates to go on as a guide to
experience since June, 1963, nearly
fifteen months back.
Granted, this is an area of statistics
which far outsteps mere collection, sum-
mation and reporting of information.
For not only is the Commonwealth Sta-
tistician chasing very elusive figures. He
also admits frankly not being able to run
some of them to earth, in his efforts to
reconcile a multitude of separate items
of overseas receipts and expenditure with
hard and fast figures for net changes in
our international reserves and position
with the International Monetary Fund.
Having surveyed the landscape in detail
and made his attributions among the
various items, he probably feels more
mystified and frustrated than anybody
that his residual or “balancing” item has
to loom so uncomfortably large at the
foot of his accounts as evidence that he
has been unable to locate under whose
auspices it flowed across the exchanges.
Economists who use the figures will
understand their limitations. But poli-
ticians, who are increasingly dilating on
foreign investment, may not, unless they
are prepared to go to the explanatory
notes at the back and do some home-
work, especially on the significance of the
individual items for capital inflow. In-
deed, to clear up possible misconceptions,
the Statistician might be well advised
to eliminate certain items which he
throws into the general pot of capital
inflow, on the grounds that these do not
figure in the current balance of payments
at all.
Tn particular, he might consider elimi-
A nating from the balance of payments
accounts all figures for undistributed
profits, for the simple reason that they
are not in any sense payments which are
made across the exchanges in the specific
years in which they are taken into the
balance of payments. As matters stand,
undistributed profits earned by Austra-
lian concerns in this country, but which
are attributed to overseas interests, are
taken into the current account as a debit
and into the capital account as a credit,
the two entries thus cancelling one
another out.
It will be seen at once that the inclu-
sion of as much, say, as a net £55 mil-
lion (the figure for 1963-64) of undistri-
buted profits on the debit side of the
current account can have a big bearing
on the out-turn of that account. For
instance, last year its inclusion meant the
current account was shown officially as
being in deficit to the tune of £l9 million.
If it is excluded, you get a surplus of
£36 million, which is a little nearer to
what one would expect with a visible
trade surplus of £250 million (calculated
on balance of payments, not recorded
trade, reckoning). On this basis the
1962-63 current account deficit would
be reduced from £225.7 million to
£178.3 million, the 1961-62 surplus of
£.6 million would become a surplus of
£47.6 million, and so on.
While making these adjustments cer-
tainly puts the current account
figures in more realistic perspective, the
elimination of undistributed profits from
capital account would have the desirable
effect of reducing the degree of popular
exaggeration about the extent of capital
inflow, which, apart from undistributed
profits, is also often taken to include the
whole of the balancing item on the liabi-
lities side of the capital account. The
latter is usually quite irrelevant to the size
of genuine capital inflow, for example in
1960-61, when the balancing item con-
sisted mainly of credit which importers
had to pay back to overseas sources,
resulting in the balancing item becoming
a minus quantity the following year.
Of course the Statistician is on firm
theoretical grounds in including undistri-
buted profits in the balance of payments,
because these are in fact a future capital
liability owed to foreigners even if they
may never actually be paid across the
exchanges. If he is to include them as
an increase in liabilities on the capital
side of the account, there must be an
offsetting item in the current account.
But to lift the figure for undistributed
profits from the capital account and put
it into his summation of overseas invest-
ment in any particular year in the
Annual Bulletin of Overseas Investment
only invites misunderstanding. While
not denying that undistributed profits
are theoretically entitled to be repatria-
ted, at any rate, for public discussion,
there is a lot to be said for not counting
them in capital inflow.
If this is done we are left with three
items in the balance of payments, the
summation of which, calculated net of
offsetting outflows under the same heads,
will give us the pertinent figure for dis-
cussions on private capital inflow. The
relevant items are portfolio investment,
direct investment (other than unremit-
ted profits) in branches of overseas com-
panies operating here, and direct invest-
ment (other than unremitted profits) in
subsidiaries of overseas companies opera-
ting in Australia.
A s noted in the first paragraph, the
balance of payments figures for
1963-64 leave certain gaps. They are
precisely these three items which are all
lumped together with the balancing item.
At this stage it is impossible even to make
an intelligent guess at them. However,
if the balancing item for last year is the
same as for 1962-63, that is £44 million,
it would mean that in 1963-64 genuine
capital inflow on my suggested basis
would have dropped from £172 million
in 1962-63 to about £164 million. For
the three previous years, on the same
basis, it was £114.4 million (1962-63),
£117.4 million (1960-61) and £127 mil-
lion (1959-60). Averaged over the five
years, this would give us a net inflow of
roughly £l5O million a year.
In that five-year period we incurred a
net aggregate deficit of £842 million on
current account after debiting net undis-
tributed profits totalling £248 million.
Deducting undistributed profits, this
works out to be an average “true'’ defi-
cit on current account of about £l2O
million a year for the period. Taking
genuine capital inflow on my basis to be
£l5O million a year over the five years,
it will be seen it has been clearing the
deficit with about £3O million a year to
spare.
It is this narrow concept of capital
inflow as capital which actually crosses
the international exchanges that counts
when the chips are down on the balance
of payments front and it is this concept
which should, in my view, be used in
public discussions on foreign investment.

A Long Road for Motels
The bright boy of the stock exchanges
in 1960, the motel business, has
been pushed into the corner by rumors
of over-capitalisation, mismanagement
and too-rapid expansion. Those in the
field, while admitting that this has been
true to a certain extent, say the picture
is coming more into focus now that the
settling-down period has started and be-
lieve investors can expect better results
in the future.
Growth in the industry over the last
five years has been rapid. The first
public company in the motel game was
American Motor Courts, with a paid
capital of £458,447. Then the rush start-
ed. In 1960 shareholders’ capital in listed
motel companies totalled £1.3 million.
The two boom years for motel invest-
ment, 1961 and 1962, saw shareholders’
capital rise through £3.9 to £6.5 million.
The wave flattened out and total invest-
ment in motels in 1963 rose only slightly
to £7.1 million.
It should be pointed out that the capi-
tal referred to is invested in companies
operating only motels. According to some
motel operators, the industry got off to a
bad start in Australia when the word
“motel” conjured up in people’s minds a
magic, high profit earning business, sub-
ject to takeovers, and which would pro-
vide plenty of fruit for the get-rich-quick
people’s sideboard. This was partly true
in the earlier stages of the business. Now,
with literally hundreds of motels all over
Australia and several large chains con-
trolling a large percentage of them, they
have become more of a long term sit-
and-wait investment.
Companies’ borrowings were badly
controlled and steep interest rates (up
to 12 p.c.) mean a high level of income
will have to be generated before investors
will reap a substantial return on their
money. A few years ago, said one execu-
tive, it was easy to secure a loan to build
a motel. Now that the banks and institu-
tions have tightened their policy of lend-
ing for motels, an intending operator
must be able to put up a really good
proposition before he can get his foot in
the door.
The following table gives an idea of
the various motel companies’ present
earning capacities.

Leader in the motel business is Motels
of Australia, which runs 50 motels
(operating under the names TraveLodge
and Caravilla) and has five more planned,
two of them in Canberra. A director of
M of A said he believed the disappoint-
ment investors felt in motels was due to
the fact that they had not looked at
management.
“We found in 1959-60 that the in-
vestment fever was on us, but people
forgot to look behind the curtain to see
how experienced management was. This
lack of experience, coupled with high
interest rates and the fact that buildings
cannot be depreciated for tax purposes,
got some companies into trouble initially.
It is for this reason that it is harder to
get a mortgage on a well-founded motel
than it is to get one on some tin shed
that is supposed to pass for a factory.
“The word motel has been misused
and abused. To my mind it means mod-
ern accommodation.” (To the writer’s
mind, also, for he has seen some motels
in western NSW that closely resemble
Nissan huts and are about as com-
fortable and well furnished.) The director
continued: “Modern accommodation
means that which is required by the
traveller of the 60s and must be up-to-
date. The buildings must be modern, of
course, but they cannot be changed as
easily as appurtenances and it is in this
regard that a motel operator must keep
right on top of changing trends and
demands.”
Occupancy figures are, of course, the
motel operator’s staff of life. These figures
can be juggled, however, to present en-
tirely different pictures. There are three
ways of computing occupancy the
number of suites occupied, the number
of beds occupied (by far the most realis-
tic figure) and a combination of the two
on a weighted average basis.
The M of A director said his occu-
pancies were at a record level. “I don’t
agree that occupancies are seasonal if a
company has a spread of motels. Low
occupancies, I think, reflect an inability
to provide facilities. For one single motel,
seasons may affect its figures. For a chain
of motels, where there is bad weather in
one area and occupancy is low, good
weather in another area balances out
business.
“But let’s face it, motels in bad sites
cannot improve their business no matter
how good the seasons are. In a good
area there is always room for improve-
ment. We believe in going for relatively
valuable real estate near or on main
roads. We don’t believe in being three
miles out of a city on the approaches.
The businessman and the traveller, who
often have to transact business in a city
do not want to have to drive too far to
do so.
“In country areas we are as close as
we can get to the centre of the town.
We have on issue about 2000 credit cards
held by businessmen and travellers, so we
must provide uniform facilities as close
to the centre of the town or city as
possible to keep their custom.”
Compared to hotels, motels have far
fewer overheads. One that does plague
the accommodation industry generally is
the provision of radio and television re-
ceivers. Whereas in a private home one
licence covers as many radio or television
sets as the householder desires, motels
and hotels must license each individual
receiver. Now that the combined licence
fee has risen to £B. 10s. they are in for
an even bigger slug.
They cannot get around the problem
of radio licences by having one receiver
with a speaker in each room each
speaker must be licensed! The accommo-
dation industry has appealed to the PMG
for some sort of concessional rate on the
licences, but not one company The
Bulletin spoke to held out much hope
of an agreement.
“Television and radio licences are an
unfair imposition,” the Motels of Austra-

lia director said. “I think the Common-
wealth Government is being unrealistic
towards the accommodation industry.
Tourism is Australia’s eighth biggest in-
come earner. We are part of tourism, yet
the Government pays no attention to it.
“I hope it takes notice of a report on
the tourist industry in Australia that the
Australian National Travel Association
has commissioned. It will be done shortly
by Harris, Kerr, Forster and Co., of the
US, and the world’s largest hotel account-
ants and specialists in tourist industry
surveys.
“The biggest problem facing the
accommodation industry at the moment
is the lack of Government appreciation of
its contribution to the economy. For my
company’s own part, we are introducing
overseas funds to Australia at the rate
of about £20,000 a month, yet we get
no assistance or tax relief in any way.
“Another major problem of the motel
industry is investment appreciation. The
industry is good; it must be, otherwise
we wouldn’t make a profit. But those
sections of it that do not perform a
motel’s functions have given it a bad
name. If investors give it a chance they
will be rewarded.”
Melbourne motelier, Commodore Mo-
tels, which got off to a flying start and
rewarded investors with a higher-than-
forecast dividend, says business at present
is booming. Mr K. L. Kelly, of Commo-
dore, said the buoyant period is much in
line with the good conditions the tourist
industry is enjoying. “Although motel
companies generally do not seem to be
faring much better than hotels, they are
enjoying much better occupancy rates all
over. Most today are around 75 p.c. and
better terminal motels especially appear
to have taken much of the hotel trade.
These are motels used mainly for over-
night stays by businessmen. The motels
enjoy the advantage of easy parking and
the friendly, informal atmosphere in a
hotel you’re just a room number.
“Motels are benefiting from this over-
night trade and I don’t think fast plane
travel has eliminated the need to stay
overnight. Not many businessmen
feel like going back and forth between
cities in one day.”
Mr Kelly said he felt the motel in-
dustry as a whole was over-capitalised.
This didn’t apply to Commodore, which
earned 16 p.c. on paid capital of
£300,000 in the year to June 30. “I’m
not sure why there is too much capital
in the industry. I think it may be tied
up with the fact that the industry got
going in the pre-1960 buoyant times,
when all looked well and money was
easy to raise.
“There appears to be no other solution
than time which will give the industry
breathing space to build itself up and give
everyone reasonable earnings.” The
Bulletin feels this is the case as long
as not too many more motels come into
operation, which would mean a glut,
especially in the off-season.
Mr V. C. Davis, managing director of
Consolidated Motels Ltd, blamed bad
weather for poor results. “The industry
got going in one of the wettest years
we have ever had and it’s only elementary
that people are not going to travel when
the weather is bad. I think people have
expected motels to go immediately into
a big profit category, but it is the same
as any other industry and takes a little
time to get going.
“Once you get over the break-even
point (and a motel needs a lot of capital
to set up) your figures are very different.
Motels can do this provided they are lo-
cated in the right place to get the traffic
and the turnover.
“Since the fine weather in NSW started
in March, business has been much better
than last year. From July 1 this year,
our occupancy figures are up by about
15 p.c. This would apply to the whole of
the motel industry, probably. There is
still plenty of room for more motels in
the right places. With growing popula-
tion, more cars on the roads, longer holi-
days and more tourists coming into the
country, there is going to be a definite
need for more motels.
“Even if a motel is not breaking even
today, these factors must undoubtedly
mean that it can do so in the future.”
Mr Davis feels that Australian business
can help motels as well as itself. “There
is a need for staggered holidays in Aust-
ralia to prevent the slump in business in
summer months. If holidays could be
staggered, it would mean much more
even trade for us throughout the year.
The worst time of the year is between
October 1 and December 31. Although
it’s a wonderful time of year, not many
people go on holidays,
“If industry can stagger its leave in
such a way as to make use of these
particularly good periods for holidays
we would be much better served and we
could serve the holidaymakers much bet-
ter. From December 22 you can hardly
get a bed in Australia. Staggered holi-
days would mean a great boost to the
tourist industry,” Mr Davis added.


COMMONWEALTH BANKING CORPORATION
Highlights for 1963/64 were:—
COMMONWEALTH TRADING BANK OF AUSTRALIA
The Commonwealth Trading Bank continued to expand during the year.
The rise of £57 million in its deposits was the highest for one year ever recorded.
Loans were well spread and covered industrial, commercial, rural and social purposes.
Total advances outstanding rose by £lO million to £l9O million during the year.
The Commonwealth Trading Bank extended its services to a further 57 points and is now represented
at 978 branches and agencies.
1963/64 profit after tax £1,155,266
COMMONWEALTH SAVINGS BANK OF AUSTRALIA
1963/64 was a year of record achievement for the Commonwealth Savings Bank.
The £l,OOO million milestone in total balances was passed at 30th June, 1964, when depositors’
balances reached £1,031 million. The increase of £92 million for the year was the largest ever recorded
Active accounts increased by a record number of 200,000 to 5,860,000.
The Commonwealth Savings Bank was again the largest lender for housing in Australia loans
amounted to £59 million. Since 1946 it has lent £342 million for housing alone.
Substantial loans were made for community developments such as roads, electricity, water and sewer-
age and for churches, schools and halls.
During the year the Commonwealth Savings Bank became the first savings banfc in Australia to intro-
duce a Personal Credit Service—providing personal loans for customers.
Commonwealth Savings Bank services are now available at 8,957 branches and agencies.
1963/64 profit £4,191,266
COMMONWEALTH DEVELOPMENT BANK OF AUSTRALIA
The Commonwealth Development Bank does not compete with conventional and traditional lenders,
but provides financial help where, in the opinion of the Bank, such help is desirable, and the finance would
not otherwise be available on reasonable and suitable terms and conditions.
The Commonwealth Development Bank approved finance totalling £34 million during the year for
developmental purposes. More applications for loans, both in primary and secondary industry, were received
than last year and experience again confirmed the significant contribution to development made by the
Bank’s lending activities.
Outstanding advance balances at 30th June, 1964, totalled £62 million.
1963/64 profit £968,167

A Belated Adjustment
Markets begin their recalculations
YVThen the share market reeled last
” week it wasn’t an unexpected event
but rather a stubborn and belated ad-
justment. Ever since the Federal Budget
investors have been warned of the
whittling effect of higher labor costs,
extra tax, increased competition, rising
imports and falling commodity prices.
The continued flow of buoyant 1963-
64 company results, however, kept in-
vestors in a happy frame of mind.
Now, with many of the lame com-
panies due to report in the last three
months of the year (or even later), inves-
tors may return to the more calculating
pastime of trying to pick recovery stocks
once again.

wool prices eased at the opening
" of the new season’s sales, it was the
last straw to those investors who had
been watching the falls in sugar, lead-
zinc, etc., though at least they could
watch copper and tin still rising. Some
recovery occurred later at the wool sales,
but there had been a definite reminder
that overseas buyers are not anxious to
push prices against themselves.
Nevertheless, the statistical situation
shows that there is a strong market for
wool at reasonable prices, including the
rising trend of blended fibres.
is ★ ★
A factor assuming greater importance
in the share market is the increasing
reliance of companies on new share
issues as a source of new funds. With
tighter credit and the need to retain their
competitive position with the purchase of
new plant, etc., many companies are
resorting to shareholders again, after
giving them a miss during the high
liquidity era.
With extra demands being placed on
shareholders at a time when their own
financial situation may be tightened, it
follows that there will be a greater flow
of new issue rights coming on to the
market. Also, with a few new flotations
available, such as the 3,041,647 shares
in Associated Portland Cement at 12s.
each, investors may be forced to sell
some other shares to take up their entitle-
ments.
This could also affect the flow of
speculative funds to the oil market.
★ ★ ★
/General talk is that Associated Port-
land Cement shares should come on
the market at around the same levels of
its competitor, AK Cement, which has
been selling above 14s. to yield 3.5 p.c.
A tight market can be expected when
the shares settle down, because the Blue
Circle Group (Associated International)
holds 73.65 p.c. of the issued capital,
RMC holds 6.4 p.c. and Concrete Indus-
tries holds 3.3 p.c., leaving only 16.6
p.c. in public hands.
T\rug Houses recovered rapidly to
around 425. after sinking as low as
38s. 6d. There was some uneasiness
when the tax provision indicated that the
taxed profit did not cover the dividend
requirement.
Coming close behind this was the news
that further expansion was contemplated
in Australia by competitors, including
the offer by tender for Schering, Sydney,
by the German parent which controls
the distributing rights for its products.
It would appear that competition for
DHA will increase, not diminish.

INVESTMENT SECTION
Uncertainty Over H. C. Sleigh
Full picture of new projects needed
Tt is hoped that Mr Hamilton Sleigh
will cast some worthwhile light onto
the future prospects of his company,
H. C. Sleigh Ltd, when he addresses
disappointed shareholders at the annual
meeting in a few weeks. Most of them
are feeling rather uncertain about the
value of their investment, following last
week’s announcement of a 1963-64 profit
drop from £l.B million to £1.4 million,
an ordinary earnings decline from 14.7
p.c. to 11.8 p.c. and a dividend cut from
12| p.c. to a sparsely covered 11} p.c.
Thanks to the interim report the de-
cline in profit and earnings was on the
cards. But the drop was not expected to
endanger the eight-year-old dividend rate,
mainly because directors said that profit
for the full year was expected to pro-
vide a more than sufficient cover for
a 12} p.c. payout.
The problem now facing shareholders
is that the dividend looks as if it could
be in for further cuts. This may not be
the case in the current year, but in
1965-66 a note conversion will boost
paid ordinary capital from the present
£11.3 million to around £12.5 million.
Then, in 1968-69, the figure will rise
to £13.7 million from another note con-
version. These figures are, of course,
based on the assumption that no extra
boosts occur in the meantime.
An examination of the facts on hand
at present does not throw a very good
light on the company’s chances of making
a profit which will establish an earning
rate of the size necessary to give adequate
cover for a reasonable sort of dividend.
To start with, earning rate has been in
a constant nose-dive since 1957, when
it was 32.7 p.c. In the current year, pro-
fit will suffer from a full interest payout
for the first time on the £l} million which
was raised through a private placement
of 7 p.c. unsecured notes a few months
back The bill will be £105,000.
Then, again, it is questionable whether
several of the company’s new projects
will earn decent profits this year. Mr
Sleigh would do well to enlighten share-
holders on this matter. He has said that
the 1962-63 year was one of “consolida-
tion”, in which these projects suffered a
natural delay in reaching profitability. It
seems they are still suffering and, perhaps
more important, that the group’s basic
operations are seeing a reduced profit-
ability.
The annual report may explain this
situation more fully. It is doubtful,
though, whether its findings will be much
different from those in the interim report.
Describing the December half-year, this
said that petroleum profitability and ex-
port margins fell, despite higher sales.
Tyre and rubber products managed to im-
prove. Establishment of the Dominion
Line shipping service to Japan (one of
those “consolidating” projects) had af-
fected the half-year, yet profits were ex-
pected “soon”.
Another “consolidating” investment,
the new refinery at Kurnell, created
establishment expenses too.
Mr Sleigh should give shareholders a
full picture of the 1964-65 prospects for
all these new projects, as well as an
indication of the profitability trends on
the company’s well-established products.
Despite all these forebodings, the
shares will probably keep well above
any badly depressed levels. Although
the company appears to be up against it
now, the long run holds promise of
better things Expansion and diversifica-
tion at present may be taking a heavy
toll, but the Sleigh management team
no doubt knows exactly what it is doing.
The trouble is that the shareholders don’t.
It must not be forgotten that the poor
1963-64 performance makes the group
more susceptible to takeover. It must
look rather a plum to many big over-
seas groups, and many local organisations
will be keeping their eyes peeled. The
company has often been the subject of
takeover rumors. Ampol and Boral have
actually made concrete approaches in
recent years.
On top of all this, there is considerable
doubt as to whether the latest result is
really as bad as it looks. In the first
place, Mr Sleigh says it reflects the estab-
lishment costs of new ventures. Most of
these must turn out well in the long run.
Also, although profit fell by around
£400,000, tax came back only about
£30,000. The figures are far from com-
patible.
The most important feature was the
fact that depreciation was lifted by almost
£300,000. This reflects the rapid expan-
sion, which also affected profits, .accord-
ing to Mr Sleigh. In fact, without such
an increase, and a normal tax provision,
profits may actually have risen slightly
or stayed steady. Right now, the shares
offer nothing but income. Capital gains
should be forgotten for a few years yet.
Exactly how many years may be gauged
from any statements made on the future
at the annual meeting, we hope.
ICFs Fertile Stranglehold
V[ow that the gigantic ICIANZ group
owns more than 50 p.c. of the
NSW-based Australian Fertilizers, it is
well on the way towards having a com-
plete stranglehold on the rapidly expand-
ing fertiliser industry of this country.
In the eastern States, anyway, it is the

only company that counts. With the
interest it now has in the nation’s second
largest manufacturer (it is the biggest
itself), nothing can stand in its way.
It must not be forgotten, either, that
through Australian Fertilizers, ICI can
now control ACF and Shirleys, of Bris-
bane, as the NSW firm has a 50 p.c.
interest in it.
Of course, all this control by one
company is not necessarily a bad thing.
For example, it so happens that ICI sells
superphosphate in Victoria at a sub-
stantially lower price than Australian
Fertilizers does in NSW. This is not
mainly because ICI is less money-hungry
or more efficient, etc., etc. But there is
an element, no matter how small, of this
which helps to explain the price dif-
ferential.
Actually, the main reasons for the
price differential are connected with the
railways and the fact that NSW farmers
use less super than Victorians. So pro-
duction cannot be made at those ex-
tremely high levels which ICI uses to
effect extra economies.
The deal makes rather drastic changes
to the company set-up in the fertiliser
industry. ICI bought the extra shares
from Cuming Smith, EZ Industries and
Mt Lyell Investments (a Boral sub-
sidiary). As ICl’s consideration was
shares, these three now become ICI
shareholders Cuming Smith was al-
ready a big one and will now hold close
on H million. Its original interest arose
in 1961 when ICI took over Common-
wealth Fertilizer and Chemicals.
La Dolce Concrete
jDiONEER Concrete, through the ac-
quisition of its 57th and 58th sub-
sidiaries, one in Italy, the other in Syd-
ney, has left shareholders wondering how
much further it can expand.
Both purchases appear to put Pioneer
in an enviable position in the strictly
competitive world of ready mixed con-
crete. Since they were not acquired until
late in its financial year, investors will
have to wait until results for the cur-
rent year to evaluate them exactly.
The Italian subsidiary, Pioneer Con-
crete (Milan) Ltd, will share in that
country’s building expansion. Pioneer
Concrete Services Ltd gains a 70 p.c.
interest through its UK subsidiary Picon-
serve Ltd. The remainihg 30 p.c. is held
by an Italian company, Transbeton,
whose partners comprise a cement manu-
facturer, a project builder and a quarry-
ing company.
Operations in Italy began on July 1
with a ready mixed concrete plant and
a quarry. Already expansion is planned.
Directors say plans for two further

plants and additional large capacity
trucks are well advanced. Chairman of
the Italian offshoot is Signor V. Mon-
duzzi, who has had considerable experi-
ence in Australia.
The other acquisition, Fitzpatrick
Industries Pty, gives Pioneer a blue metal
quarry almost right in the heart of Syd-
ney—where the money is. It now holds
75 p.c. of Fitzpatrick, which it bought
from CRA earlier this year after a one-
for-four issue of ss. shares at 7s. 6d.
premium. Actual purchase price of
Fitzpatrick was not disclosed but is be-
lieved to be in the region of £1 million.
Perhaps there's been enough expansion
for the time being. Shareholders, who
are keeping the price around the 17s. 3d.
mark, are mindful of the fact that the
group will have to earn handsomely in
the current year to maintain 1963's
19.2 p.c. on vastly increased capital.
Factoring Write-off
rFHE result from Australian United
Corporation, despite its appearance,
gives no cause for alarm. This merchant
banking associate of lan Potter and Co.
earned only £407,000 in the year to
June 30, rather a sharp drop from last
year’s £565,000.
But the 10 p.c. dividend rate is no-
where near any danger, thanks to the
high-performing nature of the Corpora-
tion. Earning rate is still very high at
31.5 p.c. This compares with 43.7 p.c.
in 1962-63.
Moreover, it seems that the latest
profit has been reduced by an abnormal
loss of nearly £200,000 on a certain
investment. This was Australian Factors,
now under receivership, in which AUC
had a large shareholding and on which
it had paid fair-sized premiums. Direc-
tors decided to write these shares off
altogethel and their costs, less tax allow-
ances, were deducted from the 1963-64
result.
The current year’s prospects look
very bright when one considers that
the 1963-64 result, disregarding the
£200,000 write-qff, w'ould have jumped
from £565,000 to £607,000. As no
write-off will be necessary in 1964-65,
profit can’t help but show a phenomenal
leap from the £407,000 of 1963-64.
Green Light for Comeng
After two successive profit drops, the
return to record earnings by
Comeng Holdings and an increased divi-
dend is heartening for shareholders.
Profit jumped 34.4 p.c. or £78,103,

to £304,837 after four-times higher tax
of £281,742 and slightly higher depre-
ciation of £187,043. The huge increase
in tax was caused by the termination last
year of certain tax concessions which are
no longer applicable. Outside share-
holders’ interests took £181,355 (previ-
ous year £117,363).
Earning rate goes from 13.4 p.c. to
18 p.c., giving comfortable cover to the
1H p.c. (including li p.c. bonus) divi-
dend. Last year’s payout was 10 p.c.
Directors forecast the much improved
result in July this year when they said
that although the South African opera-
tion was not a major part of Comeng’s
activities it had proved profitable. In
May it obtained an order for 267 subur-
ban railway cars worth £8.7 million.
With the South African operation,
Comeng is now the largest railway equip-
ment manufacturer in the Southern
Hemisphere. The shares, which stood at
around 6s. 9d. in July, have strengthened
to Bs. 3d. where the yield is 6.8 p.c.
Continued improvements in earnings are
likely, so the shares will go higher. Paid
capital will increase next June with a
note conversion.
Retailer Tops £2 million
Sydney- based retailer David Jones Ltd
has become the fourth Australian
retailer to earn more than £2 million
in a year, with a record profit of
£2,086,052. However, earning rate slips
back a little once again—from 27.4 p.c.
to 25.8 p.c.
The latest earning rate is calculated
on the £7,860,397 capital employed
during the year, including three months
of the £1 million issued to acquire the
West Australian Foy and Gibson
business in March this year. A much
larger provision for tax was made (due
to the new company rates announced in
the Budget), at £1,581,813 compared
with 1962-63’s £1,161,047. Depreciation
climbs from £432,891 to £605,986.
Again sales figures are not disclosed,
but directors say they were a record.
Last time they disclosed sales was in
1960-61, when they were “more than
£4O million”. Dividend remains at 121
p.c. for the sixth consecutive year and
returns 3.1 p.c. on shares which are
currently selling at about 20s.
Cyclone Pushes Ahead
A fter staging one of its best ever
profit improvements, Cyclone Com-
pany of Australia, maker of tubular steel
and wire products, is holding dividend
steady at 8 p.c. It hoisted profit 33 p.c.
from £277,910 to £370,569 after tax of
£346,161 (£220,205) and depreciation
£448,538 (£422,057).
Latest profit equals an earning rate
of 11.4 p.c. compared with the previous
year’s 8.7 p.c. and excludes £2923 capital
profit on the sale of fixed assets. Last
year, fixed assets realised £55,563. Out-
side shareholders’ interests took £49,908,
against £40,227 previously.
On the announcement of the in-
creased profit the market added 3d. to
the shares to make them 15s. 9d.
Knocked by Depreciation
tI%E reason behind Kay Corporation’s
poor 1963-64 performance actually
augurs well for a bumper result in the
current 1964-65 year. The Melbourne-
based “rent-a-car” group saw profit come
back from £52,000 to £28,000 to equal
only 9.3 p.c. on capital, compared with
17.2 p.c. previously. Of course, the
dividend has to be cut —from 10 p.c. to
9 p.c.
The main explanation for the drop
was the depreciation provision, which
jumped by £129,000 from £197,000 to
£326,000 during the year. This year the
figure should recede just as rapidly, as
it was caused by a 48 p.c. increase made
to the company’s leased business vehicle
fleet and a 38 p.c. increase in the number
of cars available for rental.
New cars depreciate rapidly in their
first year, especially those used for such
purposes. So, in 1964-65, Kay’s profit
will be boosted by lower depreciation
and also by the rapid increases in
business which are indicated by the
1963-64 extensions to the vehicle fleet.
Bonus from Beer
sphere was a rumor earlier this year
A that Castlemaine Perkins, the big
Queensland brewer and hotel owner, was
getting set for another bonus. At the
time nobody seemed quite sure what sort
of a bonus it was going to be.
Well now the rumor is truth, but the
bonus is not shares —just 2 p.c. on the
dividend lifting it to 16 p.c. and return-
ing 2.4 p.c. on present prices around
675.
The possibility of a bonus share issue
(the last one, in 1960-61, was a one-for-
four and the second in five years) should
not be completely ignored, as at balance
date last year the company had some
£4.3 million in reserves. Chairman Sir
Douglas Forbes has been reported by a
Brisbane paper as saying “Don’t forget
the directors like bonus share issues just
as much as the shareholders.” In Octo-
ber last year directors announced a
£1 million hotel replacement programme,
which would seem to indicate a sensible
reluctance to dip into reserves just now.
News of the dividend came with the
announcement of the eighteenth suc-
cessive profit advance. Earnings rose
12.8 p.c. on last year’s £801,077 to a
record £904,354, 26.6 p.c. on paid capi-
tal of £3,397,906. The earning rate, by
the way, is the second highest among
breweries and is beaten only by Cascade,
which last year earned 34.7 p.c.
The latest result remained after tax
increased by £153,000 to £863,000 and
depreciation rose £41,930 to £404,310.
Earning Rate Drift
Sydney builders’ supplier Fred Clark
(Holdings) Ltd has recorded a 36.8
p.c. profit rise but because of capital
increased during the year by note con-
versions has suffered a drift in earning
rate.
While profit rose from £80,714 to
£110,454, earning rate slipped back to
22.9 from 25.4 p.c. on the £642,687
capital. Dividend stays at 15 p.c. for
the third consecutive year.
A better performance is necessary next
year, as the company will have to
contend with larger capital again, follow-
ing a one-for-four premium issue in
May this year. Shares are at present
yielding 5.3 p.c. on purchase price of
about 14s. 3d.

Dodds Takes the Cake
V1 ( / , e’ve seen some pretty good recoveries by companies over
the last few months, but last week’s 1963-64 announce-
ment from Dodds Consolidated Industries must take the cake.
The company is based in Melbourne as a supplier of steam
generating plant and firing equipment. After a £196,000 loss
last year, directors announced a £124,000 profit.
This equals a 21.2 p.c. earning rate—a more than complete
recovery from the loss in 1963, the 4.6 p.c. earned in 1962
and the 20.7 p.c. made back in 1961.
To cap it off, the dividend is back at the 1962 level of
10 p.c. after nothing last year. If all goes well this year, it
could well return to the 17i p.c. paid in 1961, when earnings
. were only 20.7 p.c.
The 1963 trouble was caused mainly by one subsidiary and
the fact that no substantial contracts were completed. The
work done was largely of a preparatory nature on projects
due for completing in stages between 1966 and 1968. The
completion of contracts has always been the main reason
behind profit fluctuations, so the period starting in 1966 could
turn in unprecedented profits for the group.
Wurcker Wins a War
Jt’s been a long, hard pull, but it looks as though Max
Wurcker has at last achieved victory in its battle to pre-
vent takeover by Ozapaper. Exactly what the worth, if any,
of this achievement is, only time and a comparison between
the results of the two companies can tell.
One thing is definite, though. It will be some time before
Wurcker shareholders catch up on the capital gains which
would have been theirs if the bid had been accepted.
For instance, on Monday, September 14, the day accept-
ances closed, Ozapaper’s bid was worth about 465. 9d. for
each Wurclcer share—these closed at a mere 395. on the
Sydney Stock Exchange that day.
Although the last shot seems to have been fired and
Wurcker has won, the stubbornness of the company’s board
will long be remembered, as well as a few unanswered ques-
tions. True, directors set forth some reasons for their non-
recommendation of the valuable Ozapaper bid. None of these
really explained why, at one stage of the proceedings, they
persisted in recommending a lower bid from England’s William
Nash.
There are bound to be several reasons behind this attitude.
Many observers are still prepared to believe that the central
one was connected with the fact that directors were putting
their own interests before that of the company and its owner-
shareholders. William Nash wanted merely to make an in-
vestment and leave things be.
Ozapaper, on the other hand, intended to integrate and
execute economies wherever possible to create a strong
organisation. This policy would no doubt have left a few
Wurcker directors out in the cold.
More Bliss to Come
A marginal improvement from Bliss Welded Products Ltd
failed to excite investors, who added 3d. to the shares
after the announcement of a slight profit increase and then,
the day after, took off 2d. to bring them back to Bs. lOd.
Formerly Welded Products, the Bliss was added after a 50
p.c. interest was sold to E. W. Bliss Co., of USA. Profit of the
newly formed company rose from £50,884 to £53,320 and
earning rate squeezed up to 11.6 from 11.2 p.c. However, the
Bliss issue was not made until after June 30 this year so the
company will have to weld well to turn in a better result next
year.
The latest result was arrived at after tax of £41,014 (last

year £33,559) and depreciation £30,933 (£31,681). Sales rose
2.28 p.c. and directors say there are sufficient orders to keep
both divisions busy for the current financial year.
Steady Scliwepperveseence
Qchweppes (Aust.) Ltd has announced ts third successive
dividend increase since listing in 1960, even though pro-
fit for the year to June 30 was virtually steady.
In 1961, Schweppes paid 7 p.c., in 1962 8 p.c. and 1963
9 p.c. Now comes 10 p.c., out of fractionally lower earnings
of 15.1 p.c. (last year 15.2).
Latest profit is £264,419 compared with £265,711, although
when the balance sheet is published a slight increase may be
evident as the preliminary report does not say whether a loss
on sale of assets has been deducted. Last year the loss totalled
£4666 and, the year before, sale of assets resulted in a £11,331
surplus.
Much higher tax took £211,140 and reduced depreciation
£180,340 out of the gross profit. Sales were 18 p.c. higher
in the year to June 30 and this pattern is being continued in
the current year, directors say.
Well Polished Profits
\ much improved result from Wattyl Ltd, polish and paint
manufacturer, has meant little to shareholders, except,
perhaps, a mark-up of 6d. to 225. on their ss. shares.
The company turned in a record profit of £52,383, a gain
of £5954, or 13 p.c. in the year to June 30, but held dividend
steady at ]2i p.c. This is given excellent cover by the 34.9
p.c. earning rate.
Latest result follows an increase of £11,228 for the previous
year and stands after £39,503 tax (£29,950 last year) and
£10,291 depreciation (£5269).
In the preliminary report directors say all subsidiaries con-
tributed toward the result and that the Victorian offshoot has
begun production.

SECURITY ANALYSIS
Potential for Increased Earnings
Rothmans’ shares still look attractive
Tn my last article on Allied Mills
Limited I suggested that the factors
which seem to have the most bearing
on the share price of any stock were
probably a rapidly rising per share earn-
ings, industry glamor and a restricted
market in the shares. It was then pointed
out that over the last four years Allied
Mills had quite a good record, as the
annual compound rate of increase in per
share earnings had been about 8 p.c.
It will probably surprise most investors
to know that this is approximately the
same rate of increase that Rothmans of
Pall Mall (Aust.) Ltd has achieved over
the last three years.
During the course of the Allied Mills
article, it was suggested that the factor
which had influenced the market more
than the rate of growth in earnings per
share was the dividend cover and that
this was high at 2.1 times. The cover for
Rothmans’ current dividend is also 2.1
times.
It was then pointed out that Allied
Mills’ annual rate of increase in earnings
per share over a longer period had been
about 18 p.c. but that the earnings rate
of growth was tending to slow down.
While this is equally true of Rothmans,
it may perhaps be also pointed out that
the rate of increase since the company
started to earn profits in 1958 has been
at 16 p.c. per annum.
Investors must surely then ask them-
selves the question why in terms of divi-
dend yield Allied Mills sells at more
than twice the price of Rothmans, and
in terms of price earnings ratio it is
selling at considerably more than twice
the price. So far as it is at all possible
to judge, there is little reason to believe
that the prospects of Allied Mills are that
much better than Rothmans’, despite all
the adverse publicity which the tobacco
industry has been receiving over the last
eighteen months to two years.
It is likely that the major problem for
Rothmans and the other tobacco com-
panies is one of financing. This problem
could be a greater one for Rothmans
than the others, as it seems likely that
this company is required to purchase
about 50 p.c. of the Australian tobacco
crop because it would appear to hold
about 50 p.c. of the local market.
Australian tobacco is sold at auction
and settlement for the purchases has to
be made shortly afterwards. This means
that the manufacturer has not only to
finance large stocks during the period
When the leaf is being brought to matur-
ity but also has to make adequate
arrangements for storage, with its attend-
ant costs. The requirements that a cer-
tain percentage of Australian leaf must
be included in all cigarettes has largely
brought about this financing problem.
It arises because the rate of duty on
imported leaf is reduced provided that
the required percentage of local leaf is
used. It is fairly clear that manufacturers
cannot afford to ignore this percentage,
as the difference in duty is close to 2s.
per lb.
Rothmans’ figure for stocks as at lune
30, 1964, was just in excess of £l5 mil-
lion. It would appear that this was
financed mainly by the use of borrowed
money plus bank overdraft, which ap-
peared again for the first time after a
lapse of three years.
This financing by fixed interest money
produces quite a substantial charge
against the profits of the company. It is
interesting to note that from 1962-63 to
1963-64 the interest charged declined
by £158,000 approximately. This would
have had the effect of increasing earnings
£87,000 approximately, after taking into
account income tax. It is again significant
that the figure of £87,000 represents
about 74 p.c. of the increase in earnings
for the 1963/64 year and also that it
represents 3d. per share of the earnings
for the year.
So far as it is possible to judge from
the figures available in the company’s
balance sheet, the average cost of bor-
rowings has been declining over the last
three years. If this can be maintained,
it is likely that a worthwhile apprecia-
tion in the earning rate can be achieved.
Furthermore, in the directors’ report, it
is stated under the heading of “Liquid
Position” that “. . . it is confidently
expected that a stabilisation scheme for
Australian tobacco will be introduced
incorporating the provision of necessary
seasonal finance . . .” (the italics are
mine). The paragraph then goes on
to say that this will have a considerable
effect on the financial structure of the
company. It would seem to me that this
could also have an equally substantial
effect on earnings if the present interest
charge is either eliminated or substan-
tially reduced.
In the past, the company appears to
have made fairly extensive use of
retained income, that is surplus profits
plus depreciation provision, in its financ-
ing and this again could perhaps be
reduced. This could well mean that
Rothmans could again increase its divi-
dend payout, although one must note
that the rate is already high at 20 p.c.
Furthermore, the potential for a bonus
issue appears rather limited on the face
of it, although, no doubt, certain assets
could be revalued.
It may well be that this potential
change in financing arrangements could
have triggered off the announcement,
which has received fairly wide publicity,
of the intention to diversify. Presumably
quite substantial sums could be released
for other ventures once arrangements
are made for “necessary seasonal finance”
of local tobacco stocks.
On this basis, Rothmans’ shares con-
tinue to appear attractive at prices around
355. in view of the potential which
exists for increased earnings and possibly
increased dividends.

BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS
Steady Rather Than Spectacular
Ballarat Brewing’s solid virtues
Ballarat Brewing Company Limi-
-1 - ted can trace its history back to
at least 1895. In that year it was regis-
tered in Victoria as Coghlan & Tul-
loch’s Ballarat Brewing Co. Limited.
The new firm amalgamated two busi-
nesses—Magill & Coghlan and Tul-
loch & Sons. In 1911, the name was
changed to The Ballarat Brewing Co.
Ltd and the present title came into being
in 1936. Today the 10s. ordinary shares
and the 20s. preference shares are listed
in Melbourne only.
A chain of hotels is owned throughout
Victoria. The brewery plants at Balla-
rat and Geelong were sold to Carlton
and United Breweries in September,
1958, along with the associated assets
and freehold. That date was undoubt-
edly the turning point in the company’s
history. In exchange for the sale, CUB
handed over half a million “Z” shares.
Today, the dividends from these are a
vital factor in the annual result, although
their importance is gradually declining,
thanks to a policy of slow and steady
diversification adopted by the directors
in recent years.
In the 1963-64 year to May 31, over-
all income was £194,500. Dividends
from CUB provided £60,000 of this. The
most important item was, as usual, the
rent and general income from the com-
pany’s hotel properties £ 101,000.
Dividends and interest from numerous
other small investments provided the re-
maining £33,500. At balance date 1960,
88 hotels were on the books. Now there
are 73, and the sales proceeds have been
diverted to other forms of investment
on a fairly widespread basis.
Cash was ploughed into a block of
12 “OYO” flats on The Esplanade at
Geelong. A 22-unit motel has been
built at Ballarat and is being run suc-
cessfully in conjunction with the adjoin-
ing Park Hotel. The motel subsidiary
paid a well-covered 11 p.c. dividend
for 1963-64. The other main avenue
of diversification has been the purchase
of listed shares through Cogvest Pty
Ltd, an investment subsidiary.
The full effect of the CUB takeover
and the subsequent diversification are
best reflected by a study of the firm's
ordinary earning rate history. Back in
1953 it was a booming 20.6 p.c. but
erratic declines reduced the figure to
2.3 p.c. in 1956-57, and by 1958-59 a
slight recovery had been scored to 4.6
p.c. Then came 1959-60, the first full
term following the CUB moves. Profit
jumped nearly 150 p.c. to return 8.8 p.c.
on capital after a one-for-two bonus
issue. Dividend was raised from 6 p.c.
to 9 p.c.
In 1960-61, the higher dividend was
maintained and the 20s. shares were
split to 10s. units. That year and up
to date, the company has had “steady
rather than spectacular profit increases”,
a long-term prediction made by the direc-
tors in the accounts for 1960. The latest
profit of £llO,OOO was the biggest
chalked up in a long, long history.
Expansion during the year fitted in
well with the directors’ 1960 prediction
■—a forecast which will undoubtedly
hold true for many years to come. With
the exception of development at the
Botanical Hotel at St Arnaud and the
Bush Inn at Geelong, work was limited
and spread over many hotels. However,
since balance date, contracts have been
signed for a £44,000 development of
the Eureka Hotel in Geelong.
This sum is quite substantial when
one considers that only £34,000 was
spent in 1963-64 on all properties.
About £15,000 was work of a capital
nature while the other £19,000 was
absorbed by maintenance costs, from
which a tax benefit is deductible.
Future expansion and profit growth
will undoubtedly follow the lines estab-
lished since 1960, and continue to re-
flect the forecasts of that year. As most
of each year's profit is paid in dividends,
there will be only intermittent share
issues. The one preceding the 1959-60
move was a one-for-one bonus in 1950-
51. The generous dividend policy
hampers reserve build-ups, so most issues
are usually connected with a simul-
taneous asset revaluation. Even so, it
is encouraging that reserves at the cur-
rent £831,000 level are above the ordi-
nary £750,000 capital.
In addition, there still appears to be
plenty of scope for hotel revaluations,
as nothing substantial has been done
since 1952. More important, the CUB
shares, shown in the balance sheet at
£750,000, have a market value in the
vicinity of £l.B million—more than
double the balance sheet value.
The shares of Ballarat Brewing itself
are around the best levels they’ve been
for some time. Yet as a straightout
investment they do not look very
attractive, as the present 325. 6d. price
yields only a meagre 3.7 p.c. from the
dividend. However, if profits keep on
rising so will dividends and the yield.
For this reason, the stock is best con-
sidered as one with solid income charac-
teristics and a long-term capital gain
prospect.
Of course, this capital gain angle may
not be so long-term. There is little to go
on as to when the next issue will be.
There was a considerable gap between
the 1950-51 issue and the 1959-60 move.
On the other hand, the diversification
and expenditure currently going on, and
the historically high share prices, sug-
gest that the market may be expecting
something in the near future—possibly
a cash raising rather than a bonus.
Whatever happens, the company will
retain its image as a solid investment
stock offering long - term capital gain
prospects of fairly reasonable propor-
tions.

W. E. SMITH LTD
Fairly Priced at Present
11/'. E. Smith Ltd staged a good profit
recovery in the 1963-64 financial
year, more than countering the setback
incurred in the previous year. The im-
provement reflected a change in fortune
for the group’s operating subsidiary.
The company can trace its history
back to 1911, when it was formed to
carry on the business of printing and
publishing in Sydney and Newcastle. It
was reconstructed in 1920 with a paid-
up capital of £lOO,OOO.
Operations since then have been
profitable, except for a three-year period
during the depression days of 1930-33.
Capital was unchanged until 1947
when shareholders participated in a
£50,000 preference share issue. Four
years later they were able to take up
three new shares for every four held at
a 50 p.c. premium.
Since then, capital growth has been
fairly rapid, with a one-for-six issue in
1952, one-for-two cash and one-for-three
bonus in 1955-56, and a one-for-two
cash in 1962.
Paid-up capital now stands at £630,000
in ordinary shares and £50,000 in prefs.
In 1959, W. E. Smith joined J. Gads-
den (Australia) Ltd to operate a com-
pany, Queensland-based, to manufacture
corrugated and solid fibre containers in
Brisbane.
However, this venture was not
entirely successful, losses being in-
curred until W. E. Smith sold its
interest to its partner two years later.
The other subsidiary, Wingrove and
Co. Pty Ltd, also has not had an entirely
happy history, as can be seen since the
group’s accounts were first presented in
a consolidated form in 1962.
In this year, Wingrove barely made a
profit. In the following year it incurred
a fairly heavy loss of £13,481. Last
year it turned in a profit of £3657.
Nevertheless, profitable operations by
this offshoot enabled the group to show
a lift in earnings from £90,032 to
£121,835, equal to 18.9 p.c. on capital
in the latest year.
Despite the ups and downs of the sub-
sidiaries, dividend payments have been
held at 124 p.c. on the ordinary shares
for the past five years, including the
higher capital after the 1962 issues.
Last year’s distribution, with the
£2500 preference charge, required
£81,250, leaving £40,585 to go to
reserves.
The company’s reserve position is
strong, with capital reserves totalling
£158,281, sufficient for a one-for-four
bonus. Revenue reserves stand at
£328,205. Subject to intangible items of
£2463, net assets backing of each ss.
ordinary share is Bs. lOd.
The 1964 accounts show the company
to be in a very strong liquid position.
Cash in bank and on short call deposit
stood at £95,313 at balance date.
Borrowing has been confined to a mort-
gage from the AMP Society, which at
balance date stood at £210,853, with
£12,500 repayable in 12 months.
Funds from this source were used to
extend and modernise the factory at
Croydon, built originally in 1947.
Capital gains were made on the sale of
freeholds at Newcastle and in the Sydney
city area. All operations are now con-
centrated at Croydon.
The company has kept itself up-to-
date with the latest printing machinery,
with £179,493 being spent on plant and
machinery during the 1963-64 financial
year. Expenditure of a capital nature in
the current year is expected to exceed
£76,475, which the company should
have no trouble in meeting from
internal resources.
Despite a recent increase in authorised
capital from £1 million to £2 million, a
new issue in the immediate future does
not appear a strong possibility. However,
should the earnings of the subsidiary
improve to any marked degree, a bonus
issue could always be a prospect.
The shares are currently selling
around 13s. to show a dividend yield
of 4.8 p.c. At this level they appear to
be. fairly priced on past history.
ROTHMANS TOBACCO CO. LTD
King Size Growth in NZ
Oince the Rembrandt tobacco group
took over the ailing National
Tobacco Co. Ltd, of Napier, New
Zealand, and renamed it Rothmans
Tobacco Co. Ltd as a stablemate for the
Australian company, growth has been as
phenomenal as that of Rothmans in Aus-
tralia.
Already in 1958 the company made
a profit. This was doubled in 1959 when
a maiden dividend of 6 p.c. was paid.
Now, after a one-for-two bonus issue, a
one-for-one issue at par and a one-for-
two issue at the very low premium of
100 p.c., the company is paying 174 p.c.
Its earning rates are about the highest
in New Zealand. The shares, split into
ss. units in April, are selling around six
times par.
No wonder most of the public share-
holders, who own 24 p.c. of the com-
pany, are hanging on to their shares,
confident of still more benefits. The
remaining 76 p.c. is jointly held through
Rothmans (NZ) Ltd by Rothmans Ltd,
London, and J. R. Butland Pty Ltd, a
privately - owned Auckland distributing
and manufacturing group.

The growth of the New Zealand com-
pany has been on lines very similar to
those of its Australian sister. The intro-
duction of king-size cigarettes and filter
tips put it in a dominant position.
Sales are not disclosed. But according
to the latest report, published this month,
the company now manufactures more
than half of all cigarettes made in New
Zealand.
Rothmans has very energetically sup-
ported the development of the local
tobacco-growing industry which centres
in the Motueka district. In 1957 it pur-
chased 600,000 lb of local leaf; for the
current year it has contracted with
growers for 4,500,000 lb.
This increased use of locally-grown
tobacco has, as in Australia, at times
strained the company’s liquidity. In
1959, stocks were a fairly moderate
£568,000. At the last balance date they
had risen to more than £2 million,
financed from the premium issue earlier
this year and by bank overdraft of
£449,000 (since reduced).
At the same time the company has
maintained a vigorous policy of plant
modernisation, as a result of which fixed
assets have doubled in the last five years.
Shareholders hope that this trend will
continue and may encourage directors
to make another cash issue. With profit
increases of 56, 96 and 46 p.c. in the last
three years, the dividend of 171 p.c.
should remain to be very well covered.
Dividend policy has been generous.
Pay-out was maintained at 15 p.c. after
the bonus and par issues in 1962-63.
This year the board not only decided that
the new shares should participate in full,
but also raised the dividend to 171 p.c.
—despite the fact that the issue of one-
for-two at 100 p.c. premium took place
only six weeks before the balance date.
The latter fact makes the earning rates
more staggering, as the funds raised can
have done little more than reduce over-
draft in the short period they were avail-
able.

SPECULATOR’S DIARY
Sitting Out the Market Decline
Logic will assuredly triumph in the end
September 16, 1960, marked the
k-' beginning of the heaviest stock
exchange fall since the Depression.
September 16, 1964, is proving to be
a day not far behind. The frustrating
part about this time is that it is only the
poor stocks that have stayed steady in
the crash.
Most of the companies in the port-
folio deserve to be labelled growth
stocks. These include Hanimex, Malleys,
Treloar, Eric White and G. E. Crane.
Their profit growth lies ahead of them
and not necessarily behind. They are
not to be confused with the leaders,
whose large capital in most cases
prohibits much prospects of any material
benefit being passed on to their many
shareholders.
Unfortunately it is my “growth” stocks
that have been least immune from this
market crisis. Malleys and Treloar have
each suffered severe setbacks.
It is not my right to complain. In
the long run, logic usually emerges and
I’m prepared to sit it out.
Of course, there’s been plenty happen-
ing to shares other than mine. The most
extraordinary financial incident has been
the cancellation of the bonus issue by
Avala Holdings. Some weeks ago, direc-
tors proudly announced an increase in
profit, from £27,449 to £36,917, and a
1-for-10 bonus issue. Almost as an after-
thought, they indicated that £20,000 of
the £36,917 was a capital profit.
Inflated as this profit seemed then,
the position became much worse last
week. It appears that most of the
“spare tyre” aerosols stock proved so
much hot air. So a new item, “Stock
Losses”, to the cool amount of £33,000,
found its way into the revenue accounts
and the result now is a debit balance
of £12,544.
To anyone who is not a shareholder
of Avala, a cancellation of a bonus issue
is a novelty. Avala shareholders must
regard it more seriously. For people to
retain their faith in share investment,
accurate reporting is a necessity.
After a stated lower profit and a cut
in dividend, Avala directors must have
thought the market naive to then declare
a bonus issue.
This stock loss announcement a few
weeks later made it a farce. As no
mention was made in the August report,
we are to assume that directors were not
aware of this pending disaster. This
seems quite ludicrous.
Misleading reporting by some com-
panies should not be used as an excuse
by other companies not to issue interim
reports. Mr J. A. Forrest, of the giant
ACI, tried to take that line when he
recently stated that “interim reports can
be very misleading”. If he feels this
way, then he should endeavor to
present only audited half-yearly figures
together with comparative figures for
previous years. In the USA it is common
practice to present quarterly figures and
it does not seem to have affected the
better companies there. Local critics of
more frequent reporting should keep this
in mind.
With so much happening in the
financial world, it’s difficult to concen-
trate on the actual market.
First of all, some of the falls have
been much too pronounced. Treloar
Enterprises is one that suddenly shed Is.
last Thursday to close at 16s. 3d. With
the earning rate almost up to 30 p.c.
and the prospect of a further good
increase this year, I rounded up my
holding to 1000 shares.
I also bought back into William
Adams at 31s. 6d. after only selling
these shares at 375. three weeks ago.
Here again, remembering the 27 p.c.
increase in sales so far this year, profits
should be up again and the share price
should not be too far behind.
The last purchase this week has also
had a successful run in the portfolio this
year. Unlike the other two purchases,
Pioneer Concrete shares have stayed
steady at about 17s. 4d. all through the
market upheaval.
As early as December last year, the
chairman reported that profits were
showing considerable improvement. This
was in comparison to the record 1962-63
year—a year badly affected by the wet
weather and non-recurring losses in
Queensland. Later in the March interim
report, directors went further and stated
that there had been a marked improve-
ment in earning rate on the increased
capital.
The firm market price is now suggest-
ing that everything continues to go well,
perhaps good enough to kick the shares
off the 17s. mark where they’ve been for
some months.
Perhaps it’s a case of obstinacy, but
I’m not selling anything this week. That’s
not strictly correct. I have shorted 1000
Marcus Clark at ss. lid., a price which
seems much too high for any company
making a loss.
Transactions for the week were:
SOLD
1000 Marcus Clark, 5/11 £285
BOUGHT
500 Treloar, 16/3 £417
200 William Adams, 32/- £326
1000 Pioneer Concrete, 17/4 .... £BB6
Because I’ve been very liquid lately,
this week’s transactions only leave me
£47 in debt.
The portfolio now is:

THE MAN
ON THE LAND
The Non-aligned Woolgrower
Voting on reserve price proposals
TI/lost woolgrowers will by now be fairly
conversant with the matters related
to marketing which will be discussed
in a few weeks’ time in Canberra, at the
meeting of the Australian Wool Industry
Conference. Or are they?
Generally overlooked, by both those
for and against reserve price marketing,
are those woolgrowers who may be
termed non-aligned. These are the men
who do not belong to ANY producers’
organisation and who, therefore, are not
represented on the AWIC.
Strictly speaking, those who belong to
producers’ organisations such as the
APPU, which do not have AWIC
membership, are non-aligned in a sense.
But these growers do keep in pretty
close touch with what is going on.
The men who simply do not belong
to an organisation, because they have
neither the time nor the inclination, are
the ones we want to deal with specifi-
cally. How many are there?
Some estimates go as high as 45,000,
others as low as 15,000. Let’s strike a
compromise and say there are possibly
30,000. If there are so many, it follows
that their vote in a referendum on wool
marketing could be all-important They
could swing the vote one way or the
other.
It is often written, though not always
accepted, that there are 110,000 farmers
who qualify as genuine woolgrowers in
the country. The AWIC will be in a
position to decide who qualifies as a
woolgrower. While there may be argu-
ment, it is likely that the figure eventu-
ally worked out will be somewhere be-
tween 100,000 and 120,000.
No one on the AWIC is likely to argue
that the non-aligned woolgrower should
be denied the vote. At least one would
trust this would be so. Just because a
man does not belong to an organisation
should not mean that he is not a genuine
grower of wool.
The difficulty in getting these figures
exact is that none of the producer
organisations willingly reveal their mem-
berships. Each organisation, naturally
enough, likes to believe it has more active
support than its rivals. Each of the major
organisations have dark corners in their
membership which they are not very
anxious to talk about.
The Graziers, for example, have many
members who are primarily businessmen.
The Federation organisations have many
who are primarily wheatgrowers or mixed
farmers.
What follows is an interview with a
genuinely non-aligned woolgrower. He
may be typical. He may not. At least
his views should provide some food for
thought amongst those men who have
made themselves thoroughly familiar
(as they should) with the implications
of the Wool Board’s reserve price
scheme.
How are you going to vote on the
reserve price business?
I thought that was all settled.
You’re joking, surely.
Didn’t they have a meeting up in Can-
berra. You know all about that sort of
stuff.
Yes, I know something about it. But
it's more important to you than it is to
me. You’re the woolgrower.
Well, to tell you the truth, I don't get
as much time as I should to worry about
those things.
Don't you belong to any organisation?
Got no time for any of them. And I’ll
tell you something. Most of the blokes
who make a big noise at those meetings
run a pretty ordinary sort of farm.
There's one bloke in this district who
is a big noise at meetings but his place
is a disgrace.
That may be. But surely it’s just one
man you are talking about. You can’t
generalise on a thing like that.
Maybe. But what I do know is that if
I took time off every couple of weeks to
go to a meeting to hear a lot of fellows
yakking about this and that, I’d never
get anything done here. I tell you I’m
up to my neck in work. I’ve put in a
lot of oats since you were up last.
Well, how are things generally?
Not bad.
Not bad at all. I reckon on another
five good years and I’ll have everything
paid off.
Are there many like you? I mean, still
paying off their properties.
In this district, anyone under 40.
What do you think of promotion? Are
you paying too much?
I’m paying too much for everything.
Don't ask me how much goes here and
how much there. I send my wool away,
I get my cheque, and they tell me what
the deductions are. I don’t worry so long
as I keep ahead. Generally speaking,
things aren’t too bad. If I am all squared
up in five years I’ll reckon I’ve done
a pretty good job on this place. But there
was one thing I was reading about that
I reckon is bad.
What’s that?
This business of selling Merino rams
to other countries. I don’t see why they
ought to let the Russians have them.
That’s a side issue, surely. It’s im-
portant only to a handful of studs.
There’s only about 200 in the whole
country. And you don’t buy stud rams,
anyway, do you?
No, I don't. But I would if I could. I
still don’t see why they ought to let the
Russians have them. Besides, most of
those big studs have got too much land
anyway. They ought to reef a few acres
off them.
I still say it’s a side issue in marketing.
Private selling is a lot more important
really. It could be a crucial point. Have
you ever been tempted to sell privately?
I’ve been tempted, but I couldn’t if I
wanted to. I'm in to (name of stock and
station agent) for plenty now and they’re
pretty decent to me. I can't complain.
But if I was in the clear I might sell a
bit privately.
Well, what it amounts to is that you
don’t know how you will vote?
I'll have to look into it, I suppose. I
get a lot of stuff through the mail but I
usually don't get around to reading it.
It seems to me, though, that if prices
go on the way they are there’s not much
reason to change things, is there? What-
ever happens, the big bloke will come out
on top and the man like myself will be
working his guts out for the rest of his
life.

the guns and went after some foxes. The
next day we drafted some sheep. The pro-
perty, set in a shallow valley, fronted a
road which ran away to nowhere in the
distance. About three travellers went
past in two days and my host knew each
one by sight and name. The politics of
wool, the arguments for and against
reserve price, gradually receded from
one’s thoughts.
The showing of the oat crop, the likeli-
hood or otherwise of a local outbreak of
footrot, and the foxes in the hills were
the things that mattered.
Irrigation and Salt Build-up
National approach needed for full control
'II/'herever you have irrigation you
” have the problem of salt build-up.
It’s a standard plot, almost, for westerns.
Irate Mexicans vent their wrath against
the farmers further up the Rio Grande
in USA who are responsible for the
wafer spilling down and ruining their
lands.
In a less dramatic way the problem
is with us in Australia. Here, as in the
US for that matter, it is likely to be over-
come only by a great deal of scientific
thought and patient application.
In the Kerang district of Victoria,
some 60,000 acres of land have been
ruined by salting caused by run-off from
nearby irrigation projects. A community-
owned research and demonstration farm
is setting about correcting this.
What has happened is that, with con-
tinuing irrigation and lack of adequate
drainage, the water table has risen close
to the surface in land adjoining irrigated
sections. This results in the topsoil be-
coming contaminated with mineral salts,
which kill grasses and vegetation.
If you provide adequate drainage in
one area, it is unfortunately possible that
all that happens is that the water finds
its way out further along. Someone else’s
land becomes salted!
The Kerang research and demonstra-
tion farm people believe that a national
“crash” plan is necessary for the good
of all primary producers. They cannot
solve the overall problem themselves. As
a pilot plant, they can provide valuable
information for such a plan.
One way of getting rid of salt water
lying close to the surface is to pump it
into a nearby river —if there is one.
But if this is done on a large scale, the
river itself becomes polluted. Along the
Murray, for example, there is so much
salt water lying around that if it were
all pumped into the river a serious
pollution problem would arise.
The pumping away of surface, or near
surface, salt water is in any case a
temporary solution to the problem. The
real answer lies in more efficient methods
of irrigation farming so that run-off,
cause of salting, is reduced to a mini-
mum.
Community - owned research farms
such as the one at Kerang, go a long way
towards educating farmers in more
efficient irrigation. The Kerang com-
mittee, which runs the farm, is made up
not only of farmers but also business-
men, bank managers, stock agents and
others who all have a vital interest in
the productivity of the district.
The farm was started in 1955, when
it appeared that salting might result in
a severe recession in the district. By
1957, a number of surveys had been
made and in 1960, with Department of
Agriculture assistance, a major step in
land reclamation was taken. This in-
volved underground pumping and sur-
face flooding of land to leach the salt
deposits.
In 1961, a resident manager took
charge. Since that time, further grading,
sowing and fencing have proceeded as
finance and time have permitted. As a
unit, the farm is a great success with
improving pastures, higher stocking
rates (now more than 400 ewes), and
better wool and lamb production.
There is an average rainfall of 14
inches in the district and an evaporation
(Australian standard tank) of approxi-
mately 57 inches a year. The soil types
at the farm are grey and brown clays;
sand at 18 feet on the eastern side of
the farm, increasing to about 40 feet
on the western side.
The Department of Agriculture is ex-
perimenting on approximately 42 acres.
The farm has three miles of channels;
subdivision to give 16 paddocks where
there were originally three; there is a
silo, machinery shed, a manager’s home,
an internal road and a shearing shed.
Water used at the farm since its
establishment has been: an. average of
90 acre-feet a year for the 1958-61
period; and an average of 255 acre-feet
a year, including 50 acre-feet a year
on the Department of Agriculture area,
for the 1961-64 period. Water tables at
the farm are rarely deeper than three
feet anywhere. They are usually within
two feet of ground level for all winter.
The salt content in the summer is one
of 5i p.c.
The gross value of production over
the past two years has been £2OOO to
£2500 a year, or £8 to £9 an acre-foot.
If the present experiments to lower the
water tables through a combination of
ponding of water and pumping out at
sand level can prove effective, then,
coupled with careful soil and irrigation
methods in future, farmers in areas with
salting problems similar to those around
Kerang will be able to gain and safe-
guard future production from their land.
Provided the water table can be kept to
four or five feet, there should not be any
great fight-back from the salt.
The farm is a valuable research centre
for aspects of farming in the district
other than salting. Sheep and pasture
trials provide significant lessons for
farmers, who contribute £2 each a year
to belong as members or who pay £2O
for life membership.
Kerang is not the only community
research station by any means. There
are four others in Victoria already.
Interest is growing in a number of other
districts.
Clearly the more of these centres the
better. A national approach at the top
level is needed to get the salt problem
under full control, however, for the
reason that nearly all the major irriga-
tion works in the southern part of the
continent are linked with water routes
leading eventually into the Murray.
The Murray is, legally, the property
of NSW, and South Australia is involved
also as that State has farmers along the
lower reaches of the river. State rights,
and rivalries, therefore, become involved.
These should not be insurmountable.
LETTER TO THE EDITOR
Private Selling of Wool
Sir,
The writer of your article, “Bradford
Invents ‘Wool Monolith’ ”, in The
Bulletin, August 29, is sadly astray on
two points.
These are private selling and the atti-
tude of the large woolgrowers towards
selling their wool.
A considerable number of woolgrowers
who sell their wool privately do not do
so because they are in need of quick
cash, but because they know what they
are receiving for their year’s labor and,
on the day, the prices received are very
favorable compared with wool auctions.
Any person who knows the wool
market will freely admit that the price of
wool fluctuates irrespective of demand.
Quite often we see very high demand
followed by lower prices.
The grower who sends his wool to
auction has to wait varying periods be-
fore his wool will be auctioned. This
delay can be as much as three months
for wools shorn in, say, September.
Whilst a lot of us can guess what the

HENRY LINDSAY are asked to forward this

of Cambridge. New Zealand is the solicitor
for the Petitioner.
market will be in three months’ time, any
truthful person will be quite candid and
admit that his assumption on the trend
of the market is at best only a guess.
On a market that rose almost con-
tinuously from the start of the season
until early March, as happened last year,
the growers who sold their wool privately
in the early part of the season may have
sold cheaply. So did all those growers
who auctioned their wool. Private sales
were, however, well ahead of the auction
market of the day.
Currently the market for comeback
type wools for private sales is in excess
of 66 pence per pound to the grower.
This is at least equivalent to an average
of 69 pence in Melbourne (our closest
market) by the time freight and selling
charges are paid. The average auction
price is just on 60 pence, so that the pri-
vate “seller” is certainly not losing.
Turning to the larger growers, who
may be in a position to take their wool
off the market, it would be quite safe
to say that the vast majority of these
growers would not dream of taking one
bale of wool off the market no matter
how low the price was on the selling day.
Mr Bull, president of the Australian
Woolgrowers and Graziers’ Council, re-
peatedly makes statements that we must
not hold our wool off the market.
The writer has personally spoken on
this matter with executives of one of the
largest merino studs in Australia and
was told that they “meet” the market for
their wool —even though they put a price
on their rams. One of the largest pastoral
companies in Australia (UK-owned)
admits that it never takes its wool off
the market.
Typical of some of the illogical think-
ing of these growers (who, one might
hope, would have some smattering of
business acumen) are statements such
as: “I sell in the same sale each year,
so 1 must get an average price”, or “If
the market is low, I always sell with
regret, but 1 sell”.
Let me close by saying that, if the
larger woolgrowers had sufficient know-
ledge and confidence in their wool to
take it off the market in times of de-
pressed prices, we would not still be
battling to achieve wool marketing. It
would have been brought in in 1958-59.
