WEEK
GALLANTRY
VICTORIA’S decision not to hang
pregnant women inspired the following
verse from a reader of “The Age”:
“Madam, your sex’s latest gain
Has left me somewhat baffled.
I’ll swop you my seat on the train
For your place on the scaffold.”
CASH NOT KUDOS
THE BRITANNICA AWARDS are
worth $lO,OOO, but beyond that they
carry little weight. Miss Christina
Stead, who was ruled ineligible because
she does not live here, missed out on
cash not kudos.
However, it seems to fly in the face
of reason to expect our attitude to
expatriate artists to be the same as
that of Britain, as the “Sydney Morn-
ing Herald” does. It is hard here for
even the most generous people not to
feel a sense of loss when talented people
leave. How much poorer we would be
if we had no Patrick White to spring
to the defence of Christina Stead when
she is treated shabbily and tactlessly by
what he calls the Higher Junta of Aus-
tralian Intellect!
SUKARNO'S TASTE
PRESIDENT SUKARNO’S art collec-
tion, recently reproduced in five vol-
umes, displays the former Indonesian
dictator’s unexpected sense of the ironic.
In a not-so-private joke, he has chosen
just one painting to represent Russia
in his collection, and that is a study of
the Christian Holy Family done in the
idealised style of the Italian Renaissance
by an anonymous artist.
There is also evidence of the Presi-
dent’s much-publicised admiration for
beautiful women. He has included Bali-
nese statuettes and nude statues in the
Classic tradition, portraits done by
Indonesian artists, Hindu artists, and
Europeans. In assembling the y Asian
section of the collection, which was
begun 12 years ago, he has had the
advice of a panel of artistic experts,
but the smattering of European offerings
obviously represents his Qwn whims.
“He seems to have said, ‘I want that,’
and got it in any country he’s happened
to be in,” says David Cleaver, of Perga-
mon Press, the books’ Australian dis-
tributors. “For instance, there’s a por-
trait of a gipsy, done by a Belgian artist,
which doesn’t seem to fit in with the
rest of the collection at all.”
The reproductions have been pub-
lished by a Japanese firm, which sent
three groups of photographers to Indo-
nesia two years ago while President
Sukarno was still in power. The books
were done with the full co-operation
of the President. The present Indonesian
Government has sequestered the collec-
tion and is thought to be planning its
sale.
“We understand the Government is
not pleased that Sukarno has spent so
much on the collection, because of the
country’s economic position,” Cleaver
said. “Nevertheless, it will be a pity if
the collection is dispersed. For one
thing, it shows the result of the coming
together of all the different religions
in Indonesia.”
He flipped over the pages of one
volume to a hauntingly naturalistic
statue of an Indonesian, crouching and
obviously afraid. “One hundred years
ago, a statue like this would not have
been done, because Moslem religion for-
bade the depiction of any natural object
a flower, a tree, a person because
they felt it could lead to idolatory,”
The European influence shows itself
in landscapes and portraits done almost
photographically, or, alternatively, with
Impressionistic touches. And each vol-
ume has the same introduction ' —- a
highly idealised portrait of a youthful-
looking Sukarno.
Pergamon Press have imported 200
copies of the set, which sells for $lOO
here, $l5O in the U.S., and it thinks
universities and libraries will be the
main buyers.
Nevertheless, Grahame’s Book Shop
sold three copies in the first three days
of sale —• all to individual customers.
Certainly a Christmas gift with status
value.
CHALLENGE OF WAGNER
SOME EXPATRIATE artists who get
Australian comrhissions are content to
air-mail back some sketches and hope
for the best. Not so Kenneth Rowell,
who is seen at work by Robert Walker
on pages 11 and 12. Rowell has been
here to supervise “Ballet Imperial”
and a re-creation of his “Coppelia”
and is now supervising his “Tann-
hauser” for the Elizabethan’s 1968
season.
“You have to look after the whole
thing,” he said. “Otherwise everything
is likely to turn out vastly different
from your conception. It’s inevitable, no
matter how good the costumier or any-
body else is. Besides, ideas are still
occurring to you while you’re working
with the materials. I feel you must be
creative with them painting and
treating them as you go. For instance,
I’ve got some Scandinavian fabric in
a coarse weave, which I’m painting with
gilt. It’s the closest thing I can get to
coarse medieval cloths.”
“Tannhauser,” with its five major
scene changes, is not a structurally dif-
ficult opera to stage. For Rowell, its
challenge lies in the move he is making
away from the traditionally stylised
presentations of Wagner. At Bayreuth,
it’s always been done in a heavily sym-
bolic, oratorio style which is no longer
interesting. In doing an opera like this,
you have to accept the period, but see
it freshly and find new things to say
about it.
“For instance, in previous produc-
tions of ‘Tannhauser,’ the chorus has
been presented like a choir. In this one,
they’ll be moving around as courtiers
would in a medieval hall. It’s an opera
with a lot of visual contrasts - the
eroticism of the Venusberg scene, then
the purity of the Valley, and the cere-
monious Hall of Wartburg in Act 11.
I’ve tried to make it into a fusion of
the modern romantic.”
Rowell, who was born in Melbourne,
left Australia for London 17 years ago
after winning a British Council Scholar-
ship. “It was when the Russian ballet
came to Australia with their painterly
designs that I became interested in
stage designs. There wasn’t much work
around then for Australian designers,
of course. Theatrical companies here
were getting their scene painters to re-
produce American sets for their im-
ported shows.
“The biggest innovation in stage de-
sign is that, now, sets are built as
opposed to painted on. Of course, it’s

every designer’s dream to work in a
fully mechanised theatre where they
can wheel complete sets on and off
stage much as the Opera House
would have been. It’s the only way
we’ll be able to counter the realism of
the cinema.
“As it is, you’re always fighting for
space. American stage design is very
inventive. With their musicals, they
have developed a shorthand style based
on understatement and economy be-
cause it costs so much more to put
a show on in the U.S.”
THE GREETING-CARD GAME
IT IS RATHER disconcerting to find
yourself with a matched set of UNICEF
cards decorating the living-room on
Christmas morning as a result of know-
ing only highminded and worthy souls.
However, there are always enough
new groups of people finding the cards
to make it well worth while for
UNICEF to keep sending them into
Australia. Mr. F. Daniels, executive
director of the Australian National
Committee for UNICEF in Sydney,
hopes that eventually a million cards
will be sold throughout the country.
The main problem is in distribution,
because it is not possible to give a
discount to newsagents. The price of
the card is already pared down to the
minimum, and if any additional per-
centage is taken the whole program
is defeated.
In the meantime, the decision on the
right card to order is one that sends
the local committeemen into an annual
frenzy. “We never seem to be able to
win,” Daniels said. “This year a fairly
ordinary picture of stained-glass win-
dows or ordinary in my opinion
is the outright winner, and, of course,
we haven’t ordered enough.” They
didn’t order enough Salvador Dali,
either, although they felt he would
sell well. But it is very much a case
of Christmas-card roulette. A few years
ago the winning card in popularity
around the world was a pretty girl in
an orange dress. This year a similar
girl turned up and everyone ordered
enormous quantities. But she was not
like her predecessor. Stained-glass win-
dows have the edge.
Apart from a dreary little koala, who
was instantly disliked by the Austra-
lian public some years back, there has
been nothing Australian produced by
UNICEF bn greeting cards. And no
Australian artist has contributed a de-
sign to UNICEF. The koala was
a foreign artist’s conception. “The art-
ist receives no payment, but the world-
wide publicity is amazing,” Daniels
said. “At least a million brochures
about the artist and four million cards
showing * his design are distributed.”
Cliche or not, the sobering statistics
of UNICEF ma'ke the buying of their
Christmas cards seem mandatory
500,000,000 children are suffering
from hunger and neglect, and 30,000
die each day, including, one must
assume, Christmas Day as well.

ABOUT
There's a story
in a
nut's shells
By DAPHNE GUINNESS
“NUTS,” says Lance Moore, “they’re
all nuts.” He rolls his eyes upwards
and whistles phew! implying all sorts
of things about the behaviour of shell
collectors. Their antics drive him mad
in this Marine Specimen shop of his
near Sydney Harbor Bridge - under
the railtrack, actually, but they don’t
notice the noise any more. Some are
nuts plus. Suspicious, cranky, cunning,
plotting, devious. And even yes, it’s
true —thieving. Anything to get their
hands on a shell they don’t possess.
They climb all over Lance’s kitchen
table, pulling out boxes and drawers
without a thought for him beneath,
toiling over his mail orders. Some-
times he could kill the lot.
To counteract all this dramatic
activity Lance gets a bit theatrical him-
self. He wasn’t, he says, a scungy old
seaman for nothing. He once hid Josie
Somone’s shells in the refrigerator so
that artist Paul Jones wouldn’t find
them. He has stowed them in the par-
rot’s cage before now. Oh, he’s got lots
of little private places in this kitchen
behind the shop which is stuffed with
shells, millions of them, labelled, and
priced in baskets and behind glass doors,
and which is next to a pub from whence
enthusiasts pour. Oh, yes, he was saying
to a nice lady from Radio Adelaide
who wanted to interview him, oh yes,
we have lovely people in here, and in
swept the drunkest old woman he ever
saw, shouting abuse and waving her
umbrella. He thinks this put Radio
Adelaide off—well, she never returned.
Lance is puffing away at a Benson’s
and shoving tortoiseshell earrings into
plastic bags. He surveys them gloomily.
They’re just in from Fiji and more
expensive than the man said, he’d
have to look into that. Melba, his sister,
is opening mail from shell collectors
round the world. One wants a Voluta
Becki. Ho, who’d want to get that for
Christmas? Lance is in that sort of
mood today. There is Billie the packer
licking stamps; she’s gone off shells a
bit, they once made her shiver with ex-
citement. There is Cec the washer in
a grannie-length overall and sandals
and, wandering around the floor is
Cockie, the 12-year-old green parrot
with character. Cockie lets everyone
go in to the lavatory, but he won’t let
them out. That’s right, says Billie, he
attacks ’em.
Everyone’s crammed into this tiny
kitchen which is office, packing-room,
washing-room, storage-room, eating-
room, and was once a free restaurant to
sponging matelots till Melba put her
foot down, and suddenly Lance gives
his invisible signal for coffee and cakes.
Tea for Cec. Of course he gets some
normals in, too. That man selling
oranges to the Russians, beautifully
turned out he is, he’s always here buy-
ing shells for his wife. He must be
very fond of her, says Melba. It’s the
interruptions that get Lance down.
Schoolboys milling around for three
hours and spending ten cents. Not that
that matters. People who collect shells
fall into two categories: those who do
it for their beauty and those who do it
for money. They think they’re gonna
find one worth a fortune. Who’s that
out there?
It’s the insurance man, whispers
Billie. Lance lights another Benson’s.
It’s all right. He’s come to say goodbye.
He’s retiring. Now there’s a nice man
for you, says Lance, he never stays
long. Last Thursday the Persians were
in. Wednesday the French. The
Italian Consul’s been in. Eartha Kitt
sent her drummer in. Lady Lloyd
Jones has been in. She’s always in.
Ah, well. Despite the interruptions,
Lance shifted $BO,OOO worth of mail
orders, 90 percent of his trade, all
round the globe last year. He keeps a
file so he knows what they’ve got. He
has to. They write and say, “Dear
Mr. Moore, Please send something new
for my collection, cheque herewith, and
oblige.”
Mind you, some shell dealers aren’t
above a bit of skulduggery. They’ll put
on lacquer, for instance, for extra shine.
And they’ll bake specimens to whiten
them up. They will even, God forbid,
swop what someone’s bought with
second-rate specimens. It happened
once to Lance, before his very eyes,
and he’s an expert. Do you remember?
asks Melba. Does he remember.
Normally, if someone pulls a trick like
that in, say, America he’ll know about
it next day. That’s how quickly a
reputation can be ruined in the shell
world.
The telephone rings. It’s Colin Mc-
Gonigal, secretary of the Malacolo-
gical Society of Australia. Someone’s
crashed his new Holden. Wouldn’t they
just. Lance grabs the receiver. It is
one of those days . . .
And on such a day last week a nice
young man from the “Sydney Morn-
ing Herald” calls to write Marine
Specimens up. He takes one look at
the turmoil, the screaming Frenchmen,
Cockie sitting on Lance’s head and he
is inspired: “Melba the Tapper, Billie
the Packer, Lance the Yakker.” What
does Mr. Moore think of that?
Lance says he’s gone off interviews.
He is taking up French with Billie’s
hairdresser.

When it’s so darned hot that your office is an
oven, your factory a furnace, your staff slows down.
That’s bad. Bad for production and bad for
profits. What to do? Insulate with SISALATION
heat-reflecting aluminium foil insulation.
Inexpensive Sisalation makes summers 15 degrees
cooler and slashes winter fuel bills up to 40% —
think what this means in terms of improved
productivity. Everyone works better because they’re
comfortable and happy.
When insulating new or existing offices and fac-
tories, build-in the extra comfort and added weather
protection of Sisalation 450. As an added benefit, when
left exposed as a ceiling surface, its high reflectivity
improves light distribution.
Sisalation 450 has qualities no other foil can match:
it’s guaranteed fire-resistant for life and is double-
reinforced for added strength.
A proved method of insulation, Sisalation 450 is
used extensively in factories, schools, warehouses,
and in cold stores operating at sub-zero temperatures.
Before you spend a cent on insulation in your factory

AUSTRALIA’S LEADING PERMANENT BUILDING SOCIETY
BATMAN’S
MELBOURNE
The war on
want strides
painfully ahead
LAST WEEK the continuing story of
Batman’s Melbourne was dealing with
physical fitness. Could coronary-
conscious Melbourne businessmen sur-
vive without exercise? Were they so
terrified that they had to get out and
pant along the road in the early
mornings? The episode further dramati-
cally announced that a 20-mile walk
was being organised to Dandenong.
Now read on:
Melbourne has always been a good
charity-fundraising town. We have
been through the whole bit, making
cakes, pots of marmalade, and even
scones for the local church fete. Next
we had wastepaper-collecting and
then bottle drives. It gave one a sense
of duty to be able to empty bottles
on behalf of the Boy Scouts and even
the local Methodists. Next came door
knocks, but now a new and devilish
method of fundraising has hit Vic-
toria. Actually, it has been developed
in various towns over the past 12
months, and it all rests uneasily on
physical fitness.
Various ladies and gentlemen an-
nounce that they will take part in
20-30-50-mile walks and they get
sponsors to back them at, say, a
dollar a mile. It is a beautifully
thought-out piece of sadism. Often
it is a great pleasure, and worth every
penny of it, to make your dearest
enemy thrash himself over 50 miles
and get him out of town at the same
time.
The most aggressive example of this
is a doctor who plans to swim 30
miles down the Murray next month.
He is getting his town to sponsor him
at so much a mile and he hopes to
raise enough money to buy a new am-
bulance for Manangatang. I tell you,
making marmalade used to be much
easier.
The greatest example of all this
was last week’s “Walk Against Want,”
organised for community aid abroad
and inter-church union. More than
1200 walked and 1128 were actually
sponsored. Starting time was 7.30 p.m.,
and among the distinguished starters
were Bishop Geoffrey Sambell, Dr. Jim
Cairns and his wife, and quiz king
Barry Jones. The Bishop didn’t make
it very far, but the Cairns pair had a
fine determined style and walked 12
miles to Monash University with Barry
Jones.
Some were so passionately devoted
to fitness they thought walking a little
absurd and decided to run the 20 miles
instead. The Reverend Keith Leigh,
a 55-year-old minister from Rosanna,
went to his daughter’s speech night
and then ran the entire distance in
four hours. “It is less effort to jog
than to walk,” said Mr. Leigh.
Originally the plan was to make the
walk to Frankston via Dandenong,
about 32 miles. The organisers aban-
doned the Frankston stretch because
of the lack of footpaths. Even so, some
people thought the course was not far
enough. A Mr. Liddicut walked home
32 miles to Upwey. He did this in
splendid style. He had a framed, glass-
fronted board on his back, giving his
list of sponsors. What’s more, it was
illuminated by two torch bulbs and
a battery.
The rest of us merely received for
illumination pieces of sticky tape to
place on the heels of our shoes. The
route was from the Myer Music Bowl,
out along St. Kilda Road to Dande-
nong Road, straight on 20 miles to the
Dandenong Town Hall. Clever walkers
noted that there were four pubs in the
first section, and by timing your walk
well it was possible to make the Caul-
field Club Hotel before 10 p.m. But
from then on it began to dawn why
the organisers chose such a late and
such an unbearably dreary route. For
the last 12 miles it was impossible to-
get a drink, nor was it possible to
sneak a lift. This was the one route
“He’s cheaper to run - only 5 cents
a wile!”

in Melbourne utterly devoid of public
transport.
A taxi driver reported later that the
sight was fantastic—the walkers were
stretched out from Oakleigh to Dan-
denong. They looked like refugees flee-
ing Paris. There were elderly gentle-
men with their dogs, there were 12-
year-olds, and one woman with mag-
nificent fortitude walked the 20 miles
in high-heeled shoes.
There were an extraordinary number
of unescorted 16- and 17-year-old girls
and they strode out along Dandenong
Road, their tight-panted bottoms
wobbling from side to side. They
carried their transistor radios, listened
to 3UZ all the way, and never once
had to suffer the terror of silence.
Every mile the organisers had “drop-
out posts” for those who could get no
farther, and supper was available ia ( a
church hall at Warrigal Road, nine
miles out. It looked like a casualty
clearing station. Half the walkers had
their shoes off and there were band
aids all over the floor.
Jim Cairns was admitting to fresh
blisters. He pointed out that one’s feet
became extraordinarily sensitive to
every change of surface. It was abso-
lutely true. Your correspondent’s feet
were even feeling individual blades of
grass through a quarter of an inch of
leather.
Barry Jones was talking hard. He
said President Kennedy started all this
walking get-fit business with 50-mile
walks. Only one man in his entourage
was brave enough to refuse to take
part. The man was Pierre Salinger,
the Press Secretary. So from then on
everyone called him “Plucky Pierre.”
Said Mr. Salinger: “I may be plucky,
but I’m not stupid.”
It is not generally realised the ex-
treme length of 50 miles. Over the last
20 miles one found that rigor mortis
set in from the waist down and blisters
set in over the balls of the feet. An
American who was covering the event
for the “National Geographic” maga-
zine said: “Now I understand about
those cars with the sign ‘This car travels
on fluid.’ That’s what I’m doing.”
The finishing point was Dandenong
Town Hall, and when your corres-
pondent arrived there at 1.30 a.m. the
wounded were stretched out on the
footpath outside, on the floor inside,
and one young lady was holding her
feet up in the air saying: “Look, did
you ever see one like that? It’s as big
as an egg.” She was referring to her

How many commercials can you
remember from a half hour
TV programme? Five? Ten? Fifteen?
It’s vital for all advertisers to know the potential recall of commercials
— but until last week nobody knew for sure. So GTV9 and TCN9
commissioned Audience Studies Inc., a leading international research
organisation, to study TV commercial effectiveness. They showed
similarly matched audiences a current TV programme — changing
the number of commercials in the programme each time.
The results proved a hunch we’d had for years. If your commercial
is screened along with 13 others, as compared to being one of only 8,
then your chance of recall drops 53%. GTV9 and TCN9 guarantee
you greater recall because we never run more than 9 minutes of
commercials in any prime time hour — although the Australian
Broadcasting Control Board allows 11 minutes.
Put your product on Channel 9 — Sydney and Melbourne. Join the
list of those who realise that our uncluttered commercial policy gives
them a hidden cost-per-thousand advantage in commercial effectiveness.

TREGREHAN CLARET
Essentially a
“nice bloke”
COMMENT
BY
ALAN
REID
IN TIME of tragedy a man’s defects
tend to slip from the mind; only his
virtues are remembered.
Harold Holt had plenty of virtues. In
politics, which frequently brings out
the worst in people, he remained essen-
tially a “nice bloke.” He was as tough
as ironbark when policies the things
he believed in were at stake.
But when personal factors came into
play he was too nice to be ruthless,
even though he recognised that ruth-
lessness was demanded of a Prime
Minister. He could not bring himself
to judge harshly. A consequence of this
was that he always had sympathy for
the politician, friend or foe, who was
finding the political going hard.
He had a Cabinet reshuffle lined up
for early in the New Year. He wanted
to reshuffle extensively. He recognised
the wisdom of doing this. He knew that
he had to convey an impression of
ruthlessness. But as he himself fre-
quently confessed that this was not his
style. He could see too clearly why the
other man had made a mistake. He
could never bring himself to say that
mistakes are unpardonable, even when
they damage a Government.
My feeling is that his Cabinet re-
construction would have been like the
man himself: modest, unassuming, and
sympathetic.
Even in his most recent battle with
his Deputy Prime Minister and the
Leader of the Country Party, John
McEwen, this dual aspect of toughness
on policy and tenderness in personal
relations came through.
When McEwen came out with his
criticism of the Government’s decision
not to devalue the Australian dollar,
Holt was prepared to go all the way
in defending the correctness of the Gov-
ernment’s decision and the Australian
dollar itself from any damage that
McEwen’s statement might do.
He was prepared to put his Prime
Ministership and the future of the coal-
ition Liberal-Country Party Govern-
ment on the line.
It was typical of Holt’s personality
that the interview with McEwen,
though tense, was amiable. When
McEwen accepted that Holt would
repudiate his devaluation statement and
said that in future he would keep away
from the devaluation issue, on which
the Liberal-Country Party could
founder, that was the end of things.
Most other leaders in his position
would have wanted to crow. He had
had an unmistakable win over McEwen,
one of the most formidable figures in
Federal Parliament and Cabinet. He
could have leaked quite easily the
fact that McEwen had said that he
would refrain in future from making
statements about devaluation.
As it happened, I reported that
McEwen had given this undertaking.
Holt was quite upset. He did not
want that aspect of his discussions to
come out. All he wanted was to re-
establish the image of the Liberal-
Country Party coalition.
As it was, he was planning to hold
a Press conference on Tuesday, Decem-
ber 19. He made no secret of his inten-
tion at this conference to see that
McEwen, now that he had made the
peace, would receive his full protec-
tion and support for the future.
Physically, Holt was a man of pro-
digious resilience. Last week must have
been one of the toughest and most
worrying weeks he had ever had. You
do not contemplate breaking, if the
need arises, a coalition which has en-
dured for 18 years without severe
mental strain.
Yet on Thursday when I saw him
last he was his usual self, cheerful, full
of energy, good spirits, and clearly
looking forward to a break at Christ-
mas, a break which he had promised
to spend quietly with his family, doing
with them the things he loved doing,
such as swimming, playing tennis, and,
occasionally, golf, at which he was an
erratic performer.
He had been, uncomplainingly, in
pain for weeks. During the Senate elec-
tion campaign he developed shoulder
trouble that caused acute, pain. There
were periods during that campaign that
his personal staff thought he could not
carry on.
But cheerfully, indomitably, Holt
shook off the pain whenever the need
arose, told few of his anguish, and
kept to his speaking arrangements and
travel without complaint or let-up.
When Britain devalued sterling he was
again flung into crisis with neither the
opportunity nor the desire to look after
himself and his physical welfare. He
had been taking treatment for his
shoulder, which he described to me as,
at times, over the past couple of weeks,
similar to a mild paralysis.
But it was clear that he was not
going to allow it to interfere with his
activities, even swimming.
Harold Holt was essentially nice, a
man whose pride was not in big things,
but in the simple ones such as main-
taining full employment and producing
in Australia the world’s highest per-
centage of homeowners during the 18
years of the Liberal-Country Party
administration. To be termed nice by
friend and foe alike is not a bad
achievement for a man who spent the
bulk of his life in politics.

How revolting
is the younger
generation?
ONE IS STRUCK not only by the
nonsense that has been written about
the hippies but also by the nonsense
that is often written about young
people in general. At times when
parents meet and discuss their fears, it
is almost as if they represent a doomed
class about to be overthrown by a
revolt of the generations.
The other night, at a party, I found
myself sitting there among the be-
leaguered parents, discussing their
prospective doom, while out in the kit-
chen their teenage children were
engaged in their mysterious cults.
What are they talking about? we won-
dered. What are they up to, out there?
The scene seemed reminiscent. Then
I remembered what it was that I was
remembering: being at dinner in a
settler’s house in Kenya, at the time of
the Mau Mau outbreak, looking at the
locked door behind which the servants
were up to something in the kitchen.
What were they up to, those silent
brown men? Were they sharpening
their knives out there? When they
were ready, would they break through
the door and cut off our heads?
Yet the young people who most
affront the older generations with their
mysteries are those least likely to seize
anything from anybody. These are the
ones who puzzle with their passivity
and declarations of irresponsibility. It
is in these extremists of the youth cult
that the older ones smell the greatest
dangers, yet as long as passivity and
irresponsibility are their frightening
characteristics they seem to provide the
threats of a koala: that is to say
that there is nothing they can do to
us but we could damage them if we
cut off the supply of gumleaves.
IN THE SAME WAY the cult of mere
youthfulness, the bigotry of believing:
that age settles everything, is a self- i
denying ordinance: for the young to]
hold this belief is for them to admit]
that it is they who are doomed. If
there is a special quality in mere
youngness, then it is something that
the present young will themselves soon.
lose. Whatever happened to the
flaming youths of the 1920 s when their
bodies began to wither, or grow
bloated? Any young person who sees
youngness as the essential good in
human beings should look very hard
at the next picture he sees of the
Duke of Windsor. In the sad, weak
face of this wistful old man there is

“OBSERVER”
the wreckage of the young promise of
Teddy, the Prince of Wales, symbol
of a new generation. Or one can
remember Ernest Hemingway, the
greatest of the 1920 s vitalists, dead on
the floor of his living-room, the fat
corpse in its pyjamas, the mouth blown
out by a 12-gauge silver-inlaid shotgun.
The threat of the young to the
older comes not from their youth and
certainly not from those who follow
the cult of the passive, nor from their
mere cultishness their fads in clothes
and hairstyles and jargon. (These are
merely the vanities of youth’s groupish
vanity.) Nor does it come from the
uniqueness of their “ideals”: the things
they see wrong with the world are
merely the things that older people
have told them are wrong with it.
(There is no revolt going on among
today’s young that has not gone on
before.)
ONE OF the important ways in which
the younger shoulder away the older
can occur when new styles begin to
permeate society. This process is cer-
tainly happening. A new and more
relaxed style is now taking over and
those who oppose it oppose it with the
hopelessness of an island opposing the
tides. But there is an irony in this
change. The new young are the product
of the older generation’s permissiveness.
The revolt against old concepts of
parenthood and education that began
with theorists in the 18th century is
now being carried more and more
widely into effect. Those who held to
these ideals but do not like the result
can at least contemplate the fact that
things don’t usually turn out exactly
the way you want them to.
But if there is a more real threat
from the young, it is from those among
them who want to take power from
the older.
And in this those who are most
likely to be successful are not those
who are the most idealist but those
who are the most technocratic. It is
not the hippie but the costs/benefits
analyst who threatens the power of the
old. When we speak of the coming
technocratic age we speak of the time
when the young take over. To the
romantically minded young, the ones
who want to opt out, or who want to
achieve “communication,” or who want
an instant paradise of ideals, this will
be a bitter victory: the success of what
they hate most will be achieved not
by the old, but by the other young,
the young who learn to think in the
language of computers.

Devaluation, wages and
freight: protest the lot
COMMENT
BY
MICHAEL
BAUME
McEWEN v. CABINET; Bury v. the
Arbitration Commission; the ACTU v.
the High Court; exporters (and Mc-
Ewen) v. the shipping lines. Quite an
impressive list of battles for the season
of goodwill. And all of them are just
that little bit ridiculous; they could,
and should, have been avoided.
McEwen’s attack on Australia'- de-
cision not to devalue (not only on the
basis of the damage it would do to
exporters but also having a crack at
the strength of the dollar itself) could
have had the result of making certain
the Government adopted a very
generous approach to the affected indus-
tries. But if it were simply a tactical
move to get benefits for his supporters,
it was a pretty extreme one.
McEwen is on far stronger ground
in his assault on the shipping confer-
ence that is being so difficult about
freight rates to Britain and Europe.
Whether or not the Government itself
has any real powers of breaking up the
Australia-Europe shipping conference
under the Trade Practices Act, there
is a lot to be said for direct action
against the shippers by exporting groups
(like the Meat Board), even if a refusal
to ship at the 12 \ percent higher rates
(in sterling terms) demanded by the
conference would damage exporters’
chances of getting goods to market for
a while. It is all very well for shipping
lines to stress that a 12J percent rise
in freights in sterling currency still
leaves them almost five percent below
their pre-devaulation levels. But the
realities are that many commodities are
shipped out of Australia predominantly
in British ships (like meat). There can
be no justification whatsoever for
freight rates on these items to increase
by any more than the seven percent or
so by which British shipping companies’
sterling costs have risen because of de-
valuation. For other commodities like
wool, which are largely shipped by
European lines, there is a good case for
a 121 percent rise—and it has, in fact,
been agreed on.
The reason for the distinction be-
tween British and European ships is
simple; devaluation has reduced the
cost of running British ships, but has
not affected in any way the costs of
running European ships, whose only
relation with sterling is that freight
charges are paid in it. The European
shippers are, in fact, suffering almost
a five percent fall in earnings by get-
ting a freight rate rise of only 124-
percent (since it would take a 16.7
percent rise fully to offset the 14.3 per-
cent fall in revenue following sterling’s
devaluation). If the British shipping
lines’ response to the devaluation situa-
tion is representative of British industry
as a whole, then devaluation will cer-
tainly not save Britain from disaster.
All this may sound like special plead-
ing for the Australian exporters who
stand to gain from the lower freight
rates. But remember that devaluation
has already made their problems in
Britain even greater, and that a reduc-
tion in freight rates would only par-
tially offset the cost disadvantage that
they now face in what, for many of
them, has been their major market.
On the wages front, where the
ACTU is far from happy about the
end of the basic wage and where Mr.
Bury did his best to give the economy
a bad attack of inflation-itis, things are
not nearly so bad as they look, although
there is no doubt that there could be
a serious wave of strikes in the New
Year unless the labor situation is
handled very carefully—far more care-
fully than Mr. Bury handled it last
week.
There was a great deal of protesting,
too much, by both sides following last
week’s two major industrial decisions,
one by the High Court and the other
by the Arbitration Commission. In
reality, getting rid of the old basic
wage is not a bad idea despite the
strength of trade union objection; and
there is a lot to be said for the latest
rises in the metal trades’ minimum
wage rates, too, since most tradesmen
have been getting over-award pay-
ments almost as big as the rise, any-
way. Both sides claim they lost. The
unions are already preparing to do
battle over the prospect that most of
the average rise of $7.40 a week will
be absorbed into existing over-award
payments (and that the increases
granted will not flow to other unions);
the employers are lamenting the cost
of the pay rise. And the Minister for
Labor and National Service, Mr.
L. H. E. Bury, has damned the judg-
ment and accused the Commisioners
of sidestepping their responsibility.
The total wage decision seems simple
commonsense. Instead of having two
bites at the wages cherry (settling
Vvhat the basic wage should be on
economic and other grounds in one
lengthy court case and then deciding
in another what margins for skill should
be) the “total wage” approach means
that it is done in one hit. If the court
wishes, any wage change for one indus-
try may then spread right throughout
industry or it may not; if not, then all
other industries have to apply and
argue their case instead of getting it
automatically as in the past. There is
no doubt that this will give the lawyers
a lot more work and will increase union
costs, but the benefits to the economy
will be significant.


AUSTRALIA
Holt, strong and stubborn,
won his last fight
THE McEWEN-HOLT confronta-
tion over devaluation last week might
have been just the Country Party
Leader window-dressing before he got
down to feather-bedding and the Prime
Minister playing along with this before
he and McEwen did a deal, but it
was not. Holt on this issue was at his
strong and stubborn best.
The Liberal-Country Party coalition
came as close to a split on this issue
as it has in the 18 years of its history
of Government. If Deputy Prime
Minister and Country Party Leader
John McEwen had walked out from
his interview with Holt, announcing
that he intended to persist in his
devaluation attitudes, it would have
been on.
Holt was a man who could be pushed
a long way, particularly when per-
sonalities rather than policies were in-
volved, but once he dug his toes in he
became immovable, indifferent even to
self-interest.
The statement in which McEwen
had earlier criticised Cabinet’s decision
not to devalue (taken while he was
abroad on a trade mission) also virtu-
ally implied that devaluation might yet
be forced upon Australia, and evoked
Holt’s stubborn streak. He undoubtedly
realised that if he took a tough stand
he was endangering the future of his
coalition Government. What’s more,
McEwen was an old friend: the two
had gone together through many politi-
cal battles. Holt didn’t like the job he
had given himself. But he took the
view that the stability of the Australian
dollar was even more important than
the future stability of his Government.
If a head-on confrontation with Mc-
Ewen resulted in McEwen walking out
of the Government and taking his
Country Party followers with him, then
that was just too bad. It was the
lesser of the two evils, and it would
have to be faced and dealt with.
This was Holt’s mood when he
arrived at Parliament House after read-
ing McEwen’s devaluation statement in
the morning papers. He sent for a full
transcript of the statement, and after
studying it he summoned senior Liberal
Ministers then in Canberra. The
Ministers were Treasurer William Mc-
Mahon, Minister for External Affairs
Paul Hasluck, Minister for Defence
Allan Fairhall, and Minister for Edu-
cation Senator Gorton.
The Liberal Ministers have operated
against the background of the advice
given them by their former leader Sir
Robert Menzies just before his retire-
ment. A product of his own history
and with memories of his loss of the
Prime Ministership when the Liberal
and Country Parties split in the 19405,
Menzies’ advice was to regard mainten-
ance of the coalition as vital to the
HOLT: An Australian Tragedy
Page 25
retention of the Treasury benches. It
was wise advice. But it has left the
Liberals reluctant to take action that
might offend their Country Party part-
ners in the coalition—a situation that
McEwen has exploited shrewdly in the
interests of the Country Party. But on
this occasion the Liberal Ministers
agreed with Holt that the Australian
dollar, threatened in their view by
McEwen’s statement, mattered more
than the future of their Government.
Holt and the Liberal Ministers did
not know which way McEwen would
act. Their fears were such that they
even counted the numbers. They are
close to having a majority in their
own right in the House of Representa-
tives. They examined the jackpot ques-
tion, which was whether, if McEwen
went, he could take his entire Party
with him. They came up with the view
that there would be defectors—that not
all McEwen’s Country Party followers
would go with him in a walkout that
would endanger the stability of the
Australian currency, as well as the
existence of a non-Labor Government.
This assessment was never tested.
Holt and McEwen were able to work
things out. McEwen accepted Holt’s
statement, which was virtually a repu-
diation of everything, even the facts, in
McEwen’s statement. McEwen also indi-
cated that he would not be making
further statements on devaluation.
This week’s events have, of course,
thrust devaluation into the background.
However, there is no doubt that what-
ever happens to the leadership, Holt’s
decision not to devalue and his plans
for coping with the effects of British
devaluation will stand.
Arriving for the showdown, outcome uncertain but smile confident


Arbitration
Creating disputes
IF THE Federal Minister for Labor
Mr. Bury, is still convinced that last
week’s wages decision of the Arbitra-
tion Commission was “calamitous”
and “disregarded the most elementary
workings of the Australian labor mar-
ket under conditions of full employ-
ment,” the remedy is in his own hands.
He can amend the Arbitration Act
so that the Commission may be forced
by statute to give paramount con-
sideration to the general economic
effects of its decisions rather than give
its major attention to the settlement
of industrial disputes. In that case it
might be necessary to re-construct the
Commission tx> give economists equal
representation with judges.
One of the reasons for the see-
sawing nature of the annual judgments
of the Commission is that the law
creating it and defining its powers reads
ambiguously as to whether the
national economic interest or the sec-
tional economic interests of those mak-
ing claims before the Commission
should take priority. The result has
been a series of conflicting annual
decisions.
At present the swing is toward the
sectional interests of workers and em-
ployers engaged in a particular wage
“dispute,” and the Commission has
declared that for skilled workers the
biggest gains are to made by fight-
ing claims on the value of the work
performed, and not chiefly on the cap-
acity of industry to pay or in terms
of increases in prices and productivity.
The most surprising aspect of last
week’s decision was the size of the
increases: from 10 cents up to $10.05,
with $7.40 for standard tradesmen. Fur-
ther, it appears that the potential
rises available under a work value
approach took the ACTU and the
Metal Trades Federation by surprise.
A reading of the judgments of Judge
Gallagher and Commissioner Winter
suggests that the unions might have
won bigger gains had they the fore-
sight to ask for them. For Mr. Bury
this must be an ominous suspicion.
Another curious thing about the
majority judgments of Gallagher and
Winter is the way in which they have
cheerfully made awards for 320 classi-
fications of a specialised industry. The
Investigation admittedly took some
months and a number of factories were
inspected and a lot of specialised
evidence was offered; but Judge Moore
in his minority judgment claimed that
sufficient had been presented for judg-
ments on only 70 classifications of
trades and skills.
The judgment is likely to lead to a
lot of industrial unrest which might
have been avoided if the Commission
had shown more foresight. It is clear
that the majority judgment of Gal-
lagher and Winter was made with the
view to regularising the business of
over-award payments and incorporating
them in the Arbitration process. In
Commissioner Winter’s words: “. . . by
unions’ own submissions there should be
complete or partial absorption of the
current over-award payments within
the amounts now awarded by the Com-
mission. While employers are free to
act as they wish concerning the amount
they may desire to pay over and above
the minimum rates, it should be made
clear that they are under no compulsion
to retain over-award payments at cur-
rent levels.”
The unions, however, have looked at
the increases first and the fine print
about incorporation in over-award pay-
ments later. The next thought that has
followed in logical consequence has
been that the employers will try to take
back the rises granted by absorbing
them in present over-award amounts.
Even if union officials finally take the
Commission’s point on this matter their
members are going to feel cheated.
There is certain to be trouble in the
metal trades, and if the Arbitration
Commission had been more prudent in
proclaiming its judgments a lot of it
might have been avoided. The Com-
mission is supposed to settle disputes,
not create them.
Senators
The long count
THE LONG, PAINFUL process of
counting the six million-odd votes cast
in the Senate election ground to a
close late last week, three weeks after
polling day on November 25. After
a two-week election campaign and a
three-week count, electoral officers
finally declared that 30 Senators had
been duly elected, half the chamber.
The only interest in the dying
stages of the count was in the Tas-
manian mix-up, the defeat of Austra-
lia’s first woman Senator, Dorothy
Tangney, in Western Australia, and
the drop in informal voting.
In Tasmania, there was speculation
about whether the third Labor candi-
date, television personality R. H.
Sherry, would fill a Senate vacancy
ahead of the second candidate on the
Labor ticket, K. S. Wriedt. At the
close of the count of primary votes,
Sherry, somewhat surprisingly, had
polled 23,808 more than 19,000
ahead of Wriedt.
For Sherry to have taken the second
Labor Senate seat ahead of Wriedt
would have been almost unique in the
history of Senate voting. The position
was not. clear until after the election
of Independent R. J. D. Turnbull to
the fourth Tasmanian Senate seat. His
surplus votes followed straight to
Wriedt, giving him an election quota
with some 1299 votes to spare.
In Western Australia, Senator
Dorothy Tangney, elected as the first
Woman Senator in 1943, was defeated
in a photo finish. Despite the fact
that she got more than a third of DLP
preferences, Senator Tangney was
defeated in the fight for the fifth
Western Australian Senate seat by
Senator Prowse of the Country Party.
The informal vote, following tbe
trend in the last two Senate elections,
continued to fall. In 1961 the informal
vote reached 10.62 percent, in 1964
6.98 percent, and last November 6.10
percent. But the informals were not
as low as expected, considering that
the number of candidates had fallen
from 92 in 1964 to 76 this year,
making the ballot papers much easier
to follow. The Chief Electoral Officer,
Mr. Frank Ley, showed he was still
not happy with the 359,171 informals.
Howson
A fresh start
AIR MINISTER Peter Howson, still
smarting from the mauling he received
from Parliament and the mass media
in recent months, has at last moved
to improve relations with the Press.
Pie has always maintained his door
was open at any time. This was true
to a certain extent, but the only prob-
lem was that one usually left no better
informed than when one entered. U.S.
Defence salesman Henry J. Kuss
earlier this year gave Howson and the
Australian Government a valuable
three-day lesson in the value of frank-
ness. In that period he divulged more
about the controversial Fill than How-
son and his companions had in three
years.
Howson’s troubles over the VIP
issue, ending in the tendering of his
resignation from the Ministry, com-
pleted his education. Last week he fin-
ally listened to the advice of his public-
relations experts (and rumor has it
also from some very senior people in
the Departments of Air and Defence)
Howson . . . instructive exercise


and called a “Press briefing” in his
office at the Department of Air build-
ing in the defence complex at Russell
Hill.
The mass media turned up in
strength. So did the brass, both moti-
vated to some extent by a basic desire
to look each other over. Two Mel-
bourne newspapers went so far as to
fly their Defence correspondents to
Canberra for the briefing. Present for
the Air Force in addition to Mr. How-
son were the Secretary to the Depart-
ment of Air, Mr. A. B. McFarlane, the
Deputy-Chief of the Air Staff, Air
Vice-Marshall W. E. Townsend, the
Air Member for the Technical Services
Group, Captain De la Rue, and an
Assistant Secretary (Air) Mr. A. Storr.
Also present, unfortunately but
unavoidable in the security-conscious
defence complex, was the unmistakable,
and to Pressmen distinctively irritating,
touch of bureacracy. Interviewers were
escorted to carefully numbered and
tagged chairs drawn up in two straight
lines facing the interviewees. Master
plans were everywhere, the most notice-
able in front of Mr. Howson, so he
could have little doubt who might be
asking what.
Apprehension and caution on both
sides did little to make this initial
briefing an unqualified success. Lec-
tures were delivered by the experts
and then the Press were allowed ques-
tions but only on technical matters.
Old procedures are not discarded
overnight and the few sticky questions
that did emerge caused a general
retreat under the shield of “classified
information.” Still, the exercise was
instructive and to a limited extent on
this occasion, valuable. Its potential is
what interests most.
Future briefings should see a more
relaxed panel and it is now obvious
that certain sections of the Department
of Air are in future going to be
directly approachable and able to give
more detailed and factual information
to the Australian public.
It could be coincidence, but another
junior Minister, Gordon Freeth of
Shipping and Transport, last week also
held a Press briefing, this one on the
entrance of the ANL into overseas
shipping.
Immigration
Looking up
AUSTRALIA’S IMMIGRATION pro-
gram, in the doldrums all year, has
suddenly taken a turn for the better.
The main reason is that Australia is
receiving a windfall of British immi-
grants from sterling devaluation. In
the first three weeks after devaluation
on November 18, applications by
Britons to migrate to Australia totalled
8048, some 2000 more than in the
same period last year.
But devaluation is only part* of the
story. Until November, Australia’s
immigration target of , 148,000 for
1967-68 looked like falling very short.
In November, the first effects of new
immigration agreements with Britain,
Italy, Holland, and Turkey began to
show and European immigration
applications jumped to 14,889 1500
more than in November last year.
.The Immigration Department is
more than happy with the British
figures. Up to November 18 they be-
lieved Australia had no chance of
getting the 55,000 assisted immigrants
from Britain called for in the overall
program. Devaluation, fortunately,
coincided with a big publicity cam-
paign Australia has been undertaking
in Britain. With the British applica-
tion figures going up week by week
Australia may now achieve its British
target.
The Department, however, is very
coy about the boom in British immi-
gration. In a Press statement last week
the Immigration Minister, Billy Sned-
den, listed immigration applications for
the last week in November and the
first two weeks in December without
even mentioning they were the first
three weeks after devaluation.
But if outwardly shy of wanting to
appear to be benefiting from British
misfortune, the Department is working
very hard not to let the chance slip by
without gaining as much as possible.
Already Australia has opened a new
immigration regional office in Bristol
and is planning to open another in
Leeds, bringing to seyen the number
of regional offices in Britain. The De-
partment also is planning to seek more
money from the Treasury to provide
the assisted passages for Britons jacked
off about the revalued pound.
Technology
Amazing Ikara
AUSTRALIA’S IKARA anti-sub-
marine missile looks like a real winner.
This is the verdict of the Royal Navy
(which is buying a version) and the
United States Navy, which is
reportedly designing a missile based
on a similar concept.*
A senior Department of Supply
engineer, Alan Sharpe, described Ikara
to the Melbourne branch of the Royal
Aeronautical Society recently as a
weapon designed to be carried aboard
ship and to destroy submarines with
greater accuracy and certainty than
comparable systems in other Western
navies. It is cheaper, lighter, and re-
usable. And is also capable of growth
and development for some years.
The weapons system consists of a
target locator, a ship-based predictor,
and fire-control system, a flying missile
weapons-carrier, which can be con-
trolled and manoeuvred, and a homing
torpedo, which the missile carrier
drops.
In a submarine-destroying operation,
the enemy would be detected either
by ship or airborne sonar and the data
fed into the predictor and fire-control
system. This is an improvement on
American systems, which, until recently,
did not have the capacity for directly
accepting outside readings.
As the computations are made, the
Ikara missile, carrying the homing tor-
pedo in its stubby fuselage, is swung
round ready for launching on a
swivelling firing platform. The rocket-
The Ikara missile-weapons-carrier
propelled missile looks like a tiny air-
craft, somewhat similar in outline to
the Skyhawks which the RAN is
acquiring. It is, however, much smaller.
The Ikara missile has control surfaces
which can fly it precisely to any point
that the predictor orders.
When the automatic firing signal
reaches the launcher, the Ikara blasts
off and zips over the sea to the cal-
culated position of the moving sub-
marine. (This is where it has it all
over the rival U.S. Asroc system, which
is ballistic and is aimed at the point
where the fire-control officer expects
the submarine to be.) Of course, the
moving submarine, with its own counter
systems, might have anticipated the
missile by this time and be taking
smart steps to be somewhere else.
Over the target area, at a height
which is calculated to avoid radar, but
to be high enough for a parachute to
open, Ikara opens and drops its torpedo
by parachute into 'the sea. Any move-
ments of the enemy submarine between
launching and arrival over the target
area have been relayed to the weapons
system and have automatically trans-
mitted to the manoeuvrable Ikara, so
that it arrives not where the fire-con-
troller thinks the submarine may be,
but where the submarine is known to
be.
Ikara’s homing torpedo lowers into
the sea and its submarine-detection
equipment takes over, guiding the tor-
pedo to the target. Meanwhile, the
missile has sufficient endurance remain-
ing to fly clear of the target zone. It
can then be recovered and re-used
a most valuable quality as far as Aus-


DIRECTORATE
of TRANSPORT
NEW GUINEA
Transport is a challenge in New
Guinea. The people and the country
have been divided by vast mountain
ranges, broad rivers, swampy plains,
and thousands of islands.
The Directorate of Transport, nucleus
of a Department of Transport to be
set up at an early date, has recently
been established to formulate inte-
grated plans and policies for the
development of all modes of trans-
port—land, sea and air. About 35
percent of the Capital Budget is
devoted to transport facilities and
increasing emphasis is being placed
in the Territory on economic develop-
ment.
Interdisciplinary methods will be used
and work will concentrate on the
investigation and appraisal of major
road and wharf projects and pro-
grammes, the relation of transport
investment plans to Territory-wide

PUBLIC SERVICE OF PAPUA AND NEW GUINEA
tralia’s tightly limited defence budget
is concerned.
The Ikara has a number of advant-
ages over rival systems like the U.S.’
Asroc. It is better and cheaper. It is
more accurate and more controllable.
It is lighter—and furthermore can be
re-used.
Politicians concerned with Services
weapons could validly hail it as a major
achievement of home-grown Australian
ingenuity, engineering skill, and tech-
nology. The professional team which
developed it and its related anti-tank
cousin, Malkara, numbered only 30 or
40 people. A project like this in the
United States or Britain would demand
literally hundreds of engineers, and the
weapon would cost equivalently more to
develop.
Unfortunately, Australia’s Service
chiefs and defence administrators are
not impressed by such triumphs. A
decision to promote manufacture of
weapons systems and equipment in
Australia would mean that planners
would have to plan, decide their de-
fence objectives, establish well in ad-
vance weapons and systems specifica-
tions, and co-operate constructively with
Australian technologists who would
have the task of developing them.
So Australia’s weapons are bought
overseas and its own ingenuity and
technology languish. It is a very differ-
ent story in Sweden, for instance, w r hich
builds its own supersonic attack air-
craft designed specifically for its own
conditions and needs. Germany, even
little Switzerland, also develop their
own concepts. But not Australia.
Wildlife
Next victim?
THE IMPROBABLE PLATYPUS is
in danger of extinction, and one of the
improbable reasons is that people want
to smoke and eat. It is another case
of pesticide pollution, another appendix
to Rachel Carson’s “Silent Spring.”
The cycle begins with the spraying of
tobacco, fruit, and other fragile crops.
The insecticides are washed or blown
into the streams. The platypus eats
worms and yabbies found in or near
these streams. It conks out.
This warning has come from Queens-
land naturalist David Fleay. He em-
phasised that the conking out was not
dramatic like a shotgun, but from in-
sidious long-term effects the public just
“haven’t woken up to.” About evidence,
he said that he did not want to go off
half-cocked. Nobody had yet brought
in a platypus dead from insecticide, but
that was unlikely anyway because a
dead platypus was so' hard to find.
“They usually die in a stream, and it
is very hard to find any creature that
dies in water. Platypuses revel in the
shallow tributary streams where, of
course, the insecticides are more con-
centrated. We do know that the platy-

pus is being affected. What we don’t
know is how much. We do know that
DDT has made colonies of birds in-
fertile and that the platypus is the
most fastidious feeder on earth.”
Mr. Fleay was the first person to
raise a platypus in captivity and he
probably knows more about this odd-
ball mammal than anybody else. His
warning receives indirect support from
the Victorian Wildlife Division, which
has been carrying out intensive research
into pesticide pollution in one of the
few strongholds of the platypus. Over
the past two years not one mammal,
animal, fish, or shellfish analysed has
been without a pesticide residue. It
was not instant death that was at stake,
said a scientist with the Division, but
the slow death of the species from loss
of vigor and the reproductive capacity.
In a country of Australia’s size and
population, a proper use of insecticides
The platypus . . . DDT threat
would not harm its wildlife, but often
a sledge-hammer is used where a tack-
hammer would do the job.
The delicate platypus could be the
first to go. It does not travel, as was
discovered when David Fleay sent, on
request, a platypus to Winston Chur-
chill during World War 11, and the
poor creature died of shell-shock just
out of Liverpool. All attempts to accli-
matise platypuses outside of their
natural environments have ended in
their deaths. Their only chance of sur-
vival is in the presently polluted
streams of Tasmania and eastern Aus-
tralia.
As soon as a dead platypus is found
and analysed, it must join the long
list of polluted water birds, water rats,
foxes, snakes, frogs, Antarctic penguins,
and so on. Pesticide pollution event-
ually affects all water creatures and
those which feed on them. Some people,
according to Ronald Strahan, director
of Taronga Zoo, are now refusing
to eat fish caught in rivers known to
have pesticide fallout. Presumably
something would be done about a
definite insecticide threat to people. In
the meantime, the ornithorhyncus and
other unique examples of Australian
wildlife might survive only as museum
pieces.
New Zealand
Swedish ideas
NEW ZEALAND’S “new look”
approach to crime and punishment,
which began this year, is to be extended
during the coming 12 months. First
came an adult periodic-detention
centre, which was opened at Auckland
eight months ago: offenders were sen-
tenced to report for community work
at the centre over a fixed number of
Saturdays, but remained free to con-
tinue their normal jobs and lives the
other six days of the week. Announc-
ing that similar centres will be estab-
lished in four other New Zealand
cities, the Minister for Justice, Mr.
Hanan, said, “Experience at Auckland
has shown that this type of sentence
can be applied to a variety of offences,
including driving while under the
influence or while disqualified, dis-
honesty of various kinds, and assault.”
Some new ideas will flow from a
visit by the Director-General of the
Swedish National Prisons Board, Mr.
Torsten Erikson. For instance, in plan-
ning new penal institutions the Justice
Department has been asked by Mr.
Hanan to consider special units
whereby a wife or family could spend
a weekend with a prisoner.
Home leave is allowed for selected
married prisoners in New Zealand. It
applies to offenders jailed for the first
time. Home leave is permitted after
serving four months of the sentence
and afterwards at four-monthly periods.
Mr. Hanan favors this policy, but his
talks with Mr. Erikson have also
influenced him toward allowing con-
jugal visits to jails by prisoners’ wives.
Sweden allows completely unsuper-
vised visits. Mr. Hanan sees justifica-
tion in this on the basis that many
inmates who, because of the crime they
had committed, or for safety reasons,
could not be allowed out.
Another idea is to give courts the
authority to impose fines based on the
daily earnings of a convicted person.
Courts in Sweden can fix a fine of so
many days’ earnings.
At present in New Zealand fines are
mainly standardised, although a con-
victed person’s ability to pay is also
taken into account by magistrates.
Hanan says that in using the Swedish
fine system, authority has to contem-
plate some way of matching the fine
payment by the apprentice to that of
the wealthy man for the same offence.
“The courts must have wide discre-
tion,” he said.
With New Zealand jails over-
crowded, legislation was passed this
year urging courts to make more use
of fines as an alternative to prison
sentences of up to six months. While
this might have been regarded by
criminals as a “soft blow,” Mr. Hanan
did a fast follow-up by increasing fines
some of them by twice as much
under the Police Offences Act.


Child’s play is
THE CHILDREN of the Bellevue Hill
Primary School held their annual end-
of-the-year dance in the Sydney Town
Hall, so it was no modest affair. There
were lots of party dresses, white shirts,
shiny shoes, swinging ringlets, and
good manners. The parents watched
from the balconies. On the floor, danc-
ing the cha cha cha and the rhythm
barn dance with happy impartiality
was t e cream o t e crop o an in
dustry which annually nets millions of
dollars - the young child.
These little girls in their pretty
summer dresses, the boys handing them
politely on to the dance floor, represent
a buying force which is enormously
exploitable. Their clothes, their toys,
their entertainment are of the most
serious importance to market re-
searchers and their likes and dislikes
can make or break the biggest manu-
facturer.
The child of today is better educated,
better fed, lives at a higher standard,
and is much better able to demand
what he wants than his counterpart of
even 10 years ago. But it is still the
same child, subject to the same long-
ings, the same greeds, the same general
lack of civilisation which have charac-
terised children since time began. Born
savage, they have gradual doses of con-
formity and sophistication thrust upon
them. Today, the sophisticators are a
ruthless, efficient, and highly scientific
group. The brain of the child is by far
the easiest to wash.
Television advertising is almost com-
pletely geared to the child, with the
possible exception of lipuor and cigar-
commercials. Cigaiette advertise-
me nts. however, do have some children
enthralled. One sma 1 pnvate-schoo
boy was discovered to have a full list
of the various makes being spawned on
to the market. He was crossing them
out as he tried each packet, with suit-
able comments for future reference.
As far as singing commercials and '
selling slogans are concerned, the
child'* again is the target. It is hoped
that the brand names will be burned
into his mind when he accompanies
Mum to the supermarket. Certainly,
in primary schools and kindergartens
around the nation the children sing
merrily of inner cleanliness, happy
Vegemites, and the Sorbent dirge. The
little girl who was asked what Sorbent
was and remarked: “We put it on our
bread,” can be forgiven for a certain
confusion.
This onslaught may have developed
because advertising agents admit they
are often unsure how much of the
adult market their work is reaching,
and • copy writers wonder, sweating, _in
the small hours of the night if they
are “saying nothing to nobody.” So
they turn with confidence to the ex-
ploring mind of the child. There he

there to concentrate on with advanced
selling techniques.
“Children under 12 are inclined to
watch everything on television,” one
market researcher commented. “They
don’t move voluntarily at all once they
have started to view. They remain
transfixed until they fall asleep unless
parents notice them. So into this tre-
mendous concentration it is very easy
to drop the right messages. To them a
bright commercial is just as interesting
as a story. If it is well presented with
the right appeal the message will carry
on long after the set has cooled down,
The child sees a commercial many,

many more times than the mother.
They know brand names where the
mother only knows commodities. This
is what the agencies consider when
they make their commercials. The
name is repeated over and over and
the whole thing is pitched toward the
five-year-old viewer.”
More and more manufacturers use
children to carry the message to other
children. The child model is becoming
indispensable in the commercial world.
Miss Woolcott", of Telecast, a firm
which employs more children than they
can count easily for television and
photographic work, says that the
demand for children grows and grows.
“It is getting greater all the time. They
must be over the age of seven, unless
they are used for some special com-
modity like baby food or baby powder.
Otherwise they just need a clearance
from the Child Welfare Department
for working in television and they are
away. Photographers come banging on
our doors for children. This rage for
children in advertising came to Aus-
tralia originally from London. They
are in every facet of advertising there
and the cult is spreading.”
Miss Woolcott feels this may be be-
cause the advertising world had gone
as far as it could go in the gimmicky
style of work and has been forced to
return to the semi-comedy situations
with which the viewer identifies him-
self and his own children.
Certainly, most commodities now have
the patter of little feet in their com-
mercials. Even the soap and cosmetic
lines are inclined to feature an adoring
little girl watching with neophytic
longing as mother sprays her hair or
washes the living bra or avoids the
white tornadoes.
For this kind of cuteness the child
is paid well. Rates are $7 for the first
hour, working up to $36 for four hours’
straight photographic work. Required
is the rather brash child who can work
well in front of the camera. Shy chil-
dren, no matter how beautiful, are
out. For TV work, rates are lower and
the child receives only $10.30 for a
standard four-hour contract. He may
not have to work four hours for this.
The working child must be available
after school for photographic assign-
ments. He must be free of tempera-
ment and have an extensive wardrobe
which can fit in with singing along the
beach, swigging away at popular drinks,
or being cleaner than clean on a family
picnic, where everything including the
rowboat has apparently been bleached.
Quantities of perpetually clean white
socks are a must for the child model.
One well-known photographic agency
which handles children shudders at the
prevalence of prima donnas among the
mothers. "The children can be pretty

of the child seems to centre on the
breakfast table. Here the packets are
laden with gimmicky promises and the
odd plastic toy is buried in layers of
carbohydrates. Is there a mother who
hasn’t lost the battle against a super
sales force and' bought a packet of
something so tasteless and low in food
value that even the dog hesitates to eat
it, while the child plays for ten minutes
with some minute toy? There was even
a time when a large smallgoods firm
packaged plastic toys in with their fat
bacon. The toys became so pale and
ghastly with grease that even avaricious
children were appalled.
Though youngsters scream and stamp
their feet in supermarkets for products
which originated in the jaded world
of U.S. suburbia, the big breakfast-
cereal companies are adamant that they
don’t specifically try to appeal to chil-
dren. Cereal covered in chocolate and
sugar and packaged in comic-book
style with the addition of a plastic car
is, of course, the right way for an ex-
ecutive to start his day.

It is impossible to like the people
who set out to make money by forcing
their impressions upon children. For

trying to give the impression of sweet-
ness and light,

mercialised running of the gauntlet.
The exploitation of the teenager has
reached saturation point and now the
money-makers are concentrating full
force upon childhood.
The toy industry still sets the biggest
trap for the child. In the glitter and
babble of the toy department, turnovers
are so big that even free pantomimes
can be staged to charm the patrons.
“Cinderella” at Farmer’s, Sydney, has
been cleverly presented by Maurice
Sullivan, display manager, who wrote
the music, designed the sets and the
elaborate costumes. Starring profes-
sionals Sue Blizzard and Tony Walling-
ton, the show plays four times a day to
packed and appreciative audiences.
Sullivan has done several pantomimes
and would very much like to mount an
original Australian story.
Santa Clauses, who abound this year
in Sydney after having been visited
earlier by Nathalian Deane, Mr. Claus
himself from the U.S.A., don’t always
find that children are believers.
Mr. H. W. Rosser, discreetly hedged
in with whiskers, was disconcerted when
a three-year-old denied him. Rosser
has been a Santa for four years and
feels it is a task only for those who
really like children. As many as 600
climb upon his knees each day and
even more as the peak period hits. He
tries to keep them from wanting im-
possible things and finds out from his
nine grandchildren what is in vogue
so that he won’t look dumb when
someone asks for a “green ghost” (a
game) or discusses Batman.
“There is more than a red coat and
whiskers in being Santa, though,” Alan
Mortimer, proprietor of Santa Snaps,
said. His girls industriously photograph
the hundreds of children placed on the
knees of the ten Sydney Santas. Photo-
graphs are processed in a big laboratory
and mailed to the Mums. Mortimer
has been doing this work since 1947
and he thinks the Santa business has
degenerated. “You can’t just sit him
up in a corner with a reindeer. You
have to give him a setting, a grotto,
or something.” He personally would
like to package Santa and sell the whole
deal, including chosen Santa Clauses
to the big stores.
“It’s nice to keep a bit of fantasy.
Kids are changing. They are so subtle
today—perhaps subtle is the wrong
word but as far as believing is con-
cerned, most of them are just humor-
ing their mothers. It gives them a
chance to get their Christmas message
across to the family.”
According to one toy buyer in the
city, children are still children, which
is reassuring to know. “The old fav-
orites go on and on,” he said, moving
nervously about his sparkling world of
make-believe and magic where money
was changing hands faster than the
assistants could ring it up. “There are
still little boys to buy cowboy suits, de-
spite Batman. There are still little girls
to buy dolls.”
Every Christmas in the toy world
is different and picking winners is as
tricky as playing the stock market.
“The teenage doll and the slot car
are dead. The dolls were promoted
tremendously all over the world but
they went a bit too far. They had out-
fits for everything from skiing to wed-
dings and people just couldn’t go on
supporting the dolls. We had women
coming in here buying $4OO worth of
clothes at a time. One Italian woman
did that three times putting them
on lay-by and paying them off. The
dolls were insatiable. Every time we
opened a catalogue from the States
there was more stuff to buy for them.
But, eventually, baby dolls came back.
They are different, too. We have
squirmers and weepers this year. But
the girls still like the ordinary baby
doll and the bride.
Back, too, are the model aeroplanes,
particularly those with remote con-
trol. Toy shops are embarrassed by a
huge stockpile of slot cars. Last Christ-
mas was slot-car year and this year
they are completely out of favor.
“I don’t know,” the buyer said anxi-
ously. “Something must be going to
happen next year. There is quite a
void. Cricket bats and indoor games
are filling it but model trains and cars
are out. Wheel toys are just so-so.
Little girls’ cubbyhouses are having a
vogue this year, but there is really
nothing big. It must be coming. Some-
one will promote something.”
It could be heavy equipment. In
the forefront is a 7ft. 6in. mobile crane
which rotates at 360 degrees, has its
own safety automatic locking tube winch
and a rotating jib control. This is re-
tailing at $48.95. You can also buy a
stuffed peacock from Rome for $35 or
a felt cat 6ft. high for $125.
Perhaps the trend is toward books.
At the present time close to 40 percent
of the books being imported into Aus-
tralia are for children. Though tele-
vision had a major effect in causing a
slump in adult books, the children’s
market continued to flourish.
Curiously enough, though books are
better printed and much more colorful,
experts have to admit that fairies and
elves are still successful.
“More sophisticated books come out
from time to time but they don’t really
take,” a book wholesaler said. “Chil-
dren like animal stories, something
about trains, little adventures. I think
they turn to books to escape just as we
do.”
There is definitely an upsurge in
publishing for children within Australia.
Angus and Robertson Ltd. this year
had the all-time record list of 23 new
publications. They believe this is partly
because of their new children’s editor,
Barbara Ker-Wilson, who has one of
her own books in the list and who is
prepared to travel to find authors.
Among the new books will be one by
Rosemary Hemphill, of herb fame, dir-
ected toward teenagers.
A good deal of attention is paid to
the back list of Angus and Robertson’s
and old favorites are continually re-
printed.
New publishers coming into Australia
are also looking hard at the children’s
book world and next year big promo-
tions may centre on the child who can
read.
Most children apparently read fashion
magazines, since they have a decided
sense of what they want to wear. At
least half a dozen manufacturers con-
centrate on children’s fashion. The
largest manufacturer, Silberman of
Friedelle, was so desperately caught up
in the web of fashion promoting for
quite young children that he had no
time to pause for a comment. Once the
only major manufacturer in Australia,
he now has to compete with a rising
tide of fashion houses. Soon some of
the “big names” of young kooky
fashion will be turning their machines
over to little-girl styles.
Not that there is much difference
between adult and child fashion. In
every department store and boutique
with a children’s section the fashion is
identical. The most successful garment
for children this year is the float, a sort
of A-line dress with deep sleeves made
up in a light material, and priced at
around $2O. This is also the most
popular style for women. Bathing suits
and sportswear are also cut-down adult
fashion.
“The days of the quality dress in
some unusual material is quite gone,"’
a fashion buyer for children’s wear said.
“I just follow the adult styles and knock
them off in a smaller size. There isn’t
even much difference in the price some-
times. I only have to keep one jump
ahead and I know I won’t have made
any mistakes.
“In 16 years of buying for children,
I have seen a tremendous change not
only in what children wear but in how
they look. I don’t know if it is their
diet or not, but children have more
shape. We used to be able to pop them
into low-waisted sort of things and they
seemed to be much the same shape all
the way up but now girls of seven
seem to look like little adults.”
The same story is heard in the under-
wear department, where this year caftans
and lounging pyjamas are the big suc-
cess. “Whatever is for sale in the adult
section can be found for children. Petti-
pants and witches’ britches and frilled
nighties. There are pink negligees trim-
med in black lace. Anything the mother
has can be bought for the child. From
ten years of age the little girls wear
brassieres and pantie-girdles.”
One wonders if it is the way they
want to be or the way someone else
wants them to be as they run from
music lessons to dancing lessons, buy
the latest chocolate, try the latest drink,
buy the records, and demand the goods
they have been told they want. No
matter how you look at it, your child
is worth a considerable amount of money
on the open market.


HOLT
AN AUSTRALIAN TRAGEDY
By DONALD HORNE
FOR AN AUSTRALIAN, what a way
to die! To go off for a surf and
never come back. If you sat upon
the ground and talked about the death
of heads of government —anywhere, any
time you would find no parallel to
such a death. In his dying, Mr. Holt
provided a symbol not only of his own
virtues and faults but those of the
nation whom he served. There was an
Australian character in his death that
should make us fear not only death
but Australia itself the nation that
has found a new way for a national
leader to die.
Before considering the life and
death of Mr. Holt we should consider
ourselves. If having a surf in the
Pacific Ocean or the Indian Ocean
is one of the most honorific purposes of
our existence, if pitting ourselves
against the currents of these oceans is
one of our tests of what it is to be
an Australian, what do we matter?
How can we talk about ourselves in
terms that will make sense to societies
that have something more portentous
to think about? And if we are to treat
our national leaders with such disdain
that we do not pay people to look
after them night and day, how can we
take ourselves seriously as a people
worth preserving?
Even in the VIP aircraft affair, that
lent such an uncertainty to what
proved to be the end of Mr. Holt’s
Government, making it seem so floppy
and indecisive compared with its
brighter beginnings, there was not only
the legitimate issue that our Parlia-
ment should get honest answers to
loaded questions: there was also the
undercurrent of envy and even hatred
against privilege, the threat of the un-
answered question can we value an
office so highly that we grant its holder
privileges that he may exercise as it
pleases him? If, out of the taxpayers’
money, men had been hired to keep
an eye on the Prime Minister’s safety,
wherever he was, might not parliamen-
tary tactics have blown out of this
The last picture of Prime Minister Harold Holt before his death. It was taken by
Peter Hardacre in Canberra just before Mr. Holt left for Portsea


some apparent scandal that could have
distracted attention from the things that
really mattered?
But let us first praise Mr. Holt. It
is not only custom or politeness that
makes us look for good in the dead:
it is a necessary part of our condition
as a species that is part human, part
animal, part heaven, part earth, that
we sometimes think most seriously of
our dilemmas when an unexpected
death throws into our face the con-
templation of the certainty of our own
mortality. For this reason it is some-
times only when men die that we can
discover that good in them, and in
ourselves, that makes it possible for us
to develop a sense of charity in which
we see humanity as a shared condition.
In Mr. Holt’s case, as a man, there
was obviously much good in him. He
was, and not only in obituary writer’s
English, a fine Australian, with charac-
teristics of kindness and directness
that are held in almost universal regard
in our country. But it is as a Prime
Minister that he must be appraised.
There was, in Mr. Holt’s beginnings
as Prime Minister, more shining light
than was at the time credited to him.
Those who had served with him in the
Treasury knew that he had developed,
perhaps out of humanity, perhaps out
of political instinct (or perhaps out of
both), a feeling for the Asian-ness of
Australians that contrasted so remark-
ably with the indifference to our
neighbors of Sir Robert Menzies. In
a way it was a test of how seriously
they concerned themselves with Aus-
tralia’s relations with Asia, as dis-
tinguished from the convention of mere
party prejudice, that one could judge
Australians’ reactions to the arrival on
the scene of Mr. Holt.
For instance, anyone who believed
in the necessity for immigration reform
could, irrespective of other prejudices,
do nothing but welcome the way in
which, almost in one of his first acts
of office, Mr. Holt took pleasure in
announcing reforms in immigration
procedures, even if the reforms were
minor. In the same way, even to those
who opposed Australia’s participation
in the Vietnam War, there could be a
sense of relief, unless prejudice had
altogether blinded them, that Mr. Holt
was man enough to go off to Vietnam
and visit our own boys. There was our
Prime Minister, in his open-necked
shirt and bush hat, surrounded by Dig-
gers, looking like someone who
appreciated what they were doing and
who, if he were a younger man, might
have, in the same cause, risked his own
neck. In this again he contrasted with
his predecessor, who sent off the first
troops to Vietnam with so little cere-
mony of justification that he almost
seemed like some prince who had sent
off his mercenaries into the night.
When, this year, Mr. Holt went off
on further Asian journeys he seemed
to be leading us into a new realisation
of our predicament in the world. He
visited not only committed Taiwan,
but also neutral Laos; not only com-
mitted South Korea, but also neutral
Cambodia. For those who had an
interest in such matters, by the very
movements of his own person, Mr.
Holt seemed to be dramatising a new
Australian policy, not only committed
when commitment mattered, but open
and liberal-minded when it did not,
ready to understand that friends could
differ.
This impression of newness was most
carefully crystallised when, in the House
of Representatives, in the course of a
statement on foreign policy, he uttered
a phrase that had been offered on and
off for some years to Sir Robert Men-
zies by speech-writers in the External
Affairs Department and regularly re-
jected. This was the phrase “social
revolution.” Unlike his predecessor, Mr.
Holt was ready to recognise that our
neighbors in South-East Asia had a

Holt on January 1, 1966
The happy-family impression came over strong and
early. A cup of tea from his daughters-in-law


right to the satisfaction of those aspira-
tions that Australians had already put
into practice and that this meant that
South-East Asian societies had to be
changed. In the same way, when he
visited Asian countries he showed a
natural openness of manner that
demonstrated an acceptance of equality
between peoples that, at least in his
case, since words were not Mr. Holt’s
specialty, went beyond words.
But surely it was in his general open-
ness of manner and in his eager accept-
ance of Australian ways of life that
Mr. Holt most distinguished himself
from Sir Robert. His skindiving, his
bikini-clad daughters-in-law, his “good
on you, mate” telegram after President
Johnson’s visit combined with more
serious matters to show him as a man
who was struggling to find some ex-
pression of nationality in his conduct
that would set up some common basis
between the Australian people and their
Prime Minister. That much of this was
criticised by Australians, never so sure
of themselves as when they are
“knocking,” in some ways, a
measure of his achievement, although
his inability to be finally convincing
was also a measure of his failure. Per-
haps his own Australianness had a
little too much about it of the self-
assurance of the “social” wmrld of the
two big cities on the Australian east
coast.
Of his intuitive political courage
there was no doubt. Although no
master of the single clarifying idea that
could impel new action, nor of the
conceptual framework that could make
people feel at home in a , new world,
Mr. Holt seemed to' be able to move
directly toward a decision in which he
really believed and to stick to it with a
courage that glowed with conviction.
His decision to send National Service-
men to Vietnam and his later decisions
to increase the Australian' commitment
there (trebled during his term of office)
were both reached as simple acts of
faith in the judgment of the Australian
people. Along with his support for the
Treasury’s case against devaluation
they will probably be recorded as the
main decisions of his rule.
It is also likely that historians will
try to manipulate Mr. Holt into look-
ing like someone who gave Australian
policy a more openly America-looking
direction. This seems a rather trivial
view. Australia started looking to
America under the Curtin Labor
Government in 1941, and although it
somewhat swivelled its gaze in the
latter stages of Dr. Evatt’s adven-
turist foreign policy under the Prime
Ministership of Mr. Chifley in the late
19405, throughout the Menzies period
British sentiment was never allowed to
stand in the way of a sense of Aus-
tralian expediency. Friendship with
America is, by now, ingrained in the
Australian people.
Menzies’ pragmatic pro-Americanism
was not as openly expressed as Mr.
Holt’s, but it was obdurately felt: it
was not expressed because it did not
suit Menzies’ rhetorical style, but this
oratorical lack had no effect on pri-
vate policy. When Britain and America
differed, Menzies invariably chose
America. Too much can be made of
the sharp contrast that came from
Menzies saying in one year that he
was British to the bootstraps and Holt
saying in the next year that, so far
as Vietnam was concerned, he went
all the way with LBJ. By these
words Mr. Holt carried himself into
a style that he was not able to follow
through. Although he did not care to
flatter the British in the manner of
his predecessor, he did not seem to be
able to think of anything new to say.
With a naivete that startled some of his
advisers, he was disturbed by changes
in British policy, but only with a sense
of drift.
His visits this year to America and
Britain were significant mainly be-
cause of this sense of drift. In America
Holt soon showed his conviction on Asian commit-
ments. With the Australian troops in South Vietnam
What might have been the high point of his short
term of office: President Johnson’s visit
Holt goes to the polls in the wake of LBJ’s visit. The self-assured
campaigner of the 1966 general elections'


he was treated with great friendship,
but more as the cheerful host of Port-
sea than as the Prime Minister of
Australia: his hope for economic con-
cessions from the Americans seemed
to be the hopes of a man who did
not really understand how Americans
went about their affairs. The Aus-
tralian innocence expressed in these
expectations also manifested itself in
London, where Mr. Holt stayed for a
few days to no effective purpose what-
soever.
One of the questions now never to
be answered about Mr. Holt is whether
he would finally have found the in-
spiration to begin working out that
new relationship with Britain that Aus-
tralia so plainly needs. Equally never
to be answered is the even more impor-
tant question as to whether, if he had
lived, his Prime Ministership would
have most been remembered for its
definition of a new type of regional
alliance between Australia and its
immediate neighbors in South-East
Asia. The promise of his early visits
to Asian countries had grown at least
temporarily dull in the last few months
of his life. Perhaps if he had not taken
his fatal Sunday morning swim it might
have grown brighter.
Considered from the viewpoint of
history, it seems saddest that Mr. Holt’s
death occurred at a time when his
affairs seemed to be going through a
passing decline. That his life should
have been cut off so capriciously leaves
the whole estimate of his work forever
unresolved. Had he died a few months
earlier he might have been remembered
more positively as a man who could
move in new directions: had he lived
longer he might actually have moved
in some of the directions toward which
his approach seemed inclined. As it
was, he was a man who enjoyed in-
stant success abroad but had not yet
fully found himself at home.
It was quite extraordinary that in
Australia’s domestic affairs he had not
developed anything new to offer. It
was entirely in external affairs non-
devaluation as well as Vietnam that
he showed his powers of decision. He
seemed, in some ways, to be more
concerned with his style as an Austra-
lian than with details of policy, as if it
was by attempting to project his per-
sonality rather than by acts of govern-
ment that he could most influence his
countrymen. In this he may have been
right, but his attempts in this direction
w r ere as marked by failure as success.
On the one hand there remains the
most pleasing of all memories of Mr.
Holt—the battler with his jacket off,
giving as good as he got at election
meetings, the parliamentary leader get-
ting stuck into his opponents with the
vigor of a spear-fisherman, the cheer-
ful grin, the open hand of friendship.
On the other hand, a new, uncertain
grimness, the smile gone, a tense
anxiety, the long, rambling speeches,
the nervous glances at the wristwatch.
He was half-contemporary, half old-
fashioned. In his relaxed style, in his
openness, in his simplicities, in his
acceptance of physical pleasure he was
entirely of the age. But, try to twist
himself into a new shape as he might,
his manner of thought was not that of
1967. He represented the young
promise of the late 1930 s and early
19405, admirable in itself but no longer
fully relevant to the times. There was
lacking a certain contemporary intellec-
tual capacity, an ability to project
problems into a new form, so that he
sometimes seemed to lack depth. He
w r as speaking from the depth of 20
years before, with a seriousness that
served him well in his earlier minis-
tries but that was no longer fully rele-
vant to the jobs in hand. There is
something of a tragic flavor in the way
in which he worked so very hard, and

differ, including Prince Sihanouk of Cambodia


meant so very well, but was not quite
able to look as if he were really pulling
it off.
There was one other disability in
Mr. Holt as a Prime Minister, but this
had nothing to do with contempor-
aneity. It was part of one of the oldest
stories to be found in politics. As a
political leader he was too nice a man.
After his startling success in the 1966
elections he did not use the new
strength that had been given to him
to chop out the deadwood in his ad-
ministration; it has now been revealed
that even after the downturn in his
affairs marked by the 1967 Senate elec-
tions he was not really contemplating
that ruthless reconstruction of his
ministry that even expediency would
have seemed to have declared to be
necessary. This lack of ruthlessness as
an administrator may have been part of
that overall easy-goingness that was
also manifest in his lack of intellectual
vigor.
Australians should ponder well the
disadvantages as well as the advantages
of being such a pleasant man as Mr.
Holt. The easiness of contact, the
ordinariness, the ability to work hard
and play hard, the sense of human
feeling for both fellow countrymen and
international neighbors, the eagerness to
set some kind of a new course —these
are all admirable. But as well as work-
ing hard and playing hard it can be
important to think hard; it can some-
times be more important to be stubborn
or even ruthless in policy-making than
to be a nice chap.
That many Australians seemed to
sense these national dilemmas in the
personal dilemmas of Mr. Holt is a
tribute to their commonsense and gives
grounds for optimism when looking to
the future. While some of the earlier
criticisms of his informality came from
those 'who preferred the style of Sir
Robert Menzies, there was also some
sense of percipient uneasiness: many
Australians rightly seemed to be pre-
pared to want in their Prime Minister
characteristics that they did not neces-
sarily want in themselves or in their
ordinary lives. Those who believe that
democratic government means a level-
ling down of the talents should look
more carefully at some of the criticisms
made of Mr. Holt.
When Americans contemplated the
killing of President Kennedy, they con-
templated some of the violence and
bigotry of the American nation. When
Australians contemplate the drowning
of Prime Minister Holt they should
contemplate some of the gentleness and
banality of the Australian nation. We
should make our contemplation with
equal apprehension. Mr. Holt was not
the only Australian drowned on Sunday.
Three-year-old Michael Robert Davis,
of Camperdown, was drowned in Terri-
gal Lake. Fifteen-year-old Phillip John
Munro, of Raymond Terrace, was
drowned in the Blue Lagoon. Twenty-
one-year-old Christine Foley, of Swan
Hill, was drowned in the Murray River.
On this coming holiday weekend,
drownings will probably reach their
record for the year, as will deaths from
road accidents. It is as if the certainties
of our Australian existence force us
from boredom to enact in fun some of
those risks that in less-fortunate nations
are enacted in full seriousness.
It is the triviality of the occasion of
our Prime Minister’s death that should
appal us, as well as the death itself.
He died doing something that we can
treat as one of the most serious things
that life holds: the exercise of our
bodies on a sunny Sunday. And yet,
however critical of this one might be,
there remains some splendor in the idea
that a man so devoted to the pursuit
of excellence, even if in a field of no
final importance, should die in the
course of that pursuit. And in the idea
that our Prime Minister yielded his
body to one of those oceans that join
our nation, with its certainties, to the
uncertainties of the rest of the world.
Holt urged fitness on the nation, but the strain of office began to show. Holt

The King couldn’t beat ’em,

FOR EIGHT TENSE MONTHS, ever
since the “Revolution of 21 April” as
the Greek military junta sententiously
calls it, King Constantine and the
colonels have been sparring, each wait-
ing for the opening to land a knock-out
blow.
Why, then, after patiently holding
his punch for so long, did the King
decide to deliver it last week with
such a disastrous lack of timing? The
27-year-old monarch may not be very
experienced or even unusually clever.
But one thing he might be expected to
know, by training and contacts, was the
technical facts about the chain of com-
mand in the armed forces which made
it certain that his attempt to take con-
trol would collapse with hardly a token
show of spirit within a few hours.
The blunder has been generally
ascribed to a gigantic miscalculation.
But it might be more accurate to say
that the King was forced by a clever
opponent into taking desperate action
at a time when he knew that defeat was
probable if he did, and certain if he
didn’t.
It is the recent Cyprus crisis which
provides the key to the situation. Un-
doubtedly it inflicted a severe blow
on the prestige of the Papadopoulos
regime. In the first place, although
General Grivas has carried the public
blame, the colonels were almost cer-
tainly implicated in the action of the
national guard in Cyprus against the
Turkish villages which brought the
crisis to the boil. Then, having created
the conflagration, they retreated into
total and deliberate obscurity while
the international firemen went to work
to put out the flames, helped in Greece
by the hastily appointed Foreign Mini-
ster, Mr. Pipinellis the first politician
they were obliged to accept into the
ranks of their chastely non-political
circle. And, finally, having begun their
career in April with a loudly trumpeted
assurance that they could win the union
of Cyprus with Greece where all pre-
vious political governments had failed,
they accepted a deal with Turkey for
the withdrawal of Greek troops and
the virtual withdrawal of Greece her-
self as a factor in the future of the
island.
Even the regime’s total control of
newspapers and broadcasting could not
prevent a setback on this scale from
liberating some of the pent-up forces
of opposition.
A multitude of people in Greece
, , ..... . .
at once responded to this lead in their
hearts. Some of them responded more
openly, including several Right-wing
newspaper editors
The widespread undercurrent of
optimism a ™° n S t^ie regime s op-
ponents flooded into a pervading con-
viction that at last the turning-point
m the career of the colonels had come.
Athens, in the days before the attempted
counter-coup, was a city of seething,
if silent, optimism, m which foreign
newspapers were being snapped up
from the kiosks as never before and
foreign broadcasts were listened to with
a reverence and diligence unequalled
since the German occupation.
. , .
.At this point with the road begin-
point downhill, the officers of
the revolutionary committee decided
to make their stand. Ironically, it was
the Cyprus crisis which had largely
caused their discomfiture and which
also gave them a powerful weapon of
victory, the fact that, to face the threat
on the Turkish border, the Third Army
Corps in the north, on which the King
relied for support, had been heavily
remforced from the south by armored
units and officers loyal to the junta.
The King seems then to have been
presented with an ultimatum from the
colonels threatening to take over the
remaining strings of power if he did
not voluntarily agree to dispense with
his own Prime Minister, Mr. Kollias,
who has now left the country with him.
With nothing left to lose, the King
was forced into making his move—at
a time he did not choose and with the
near certainty of failure.
Now, Colonel Papadopoulos’ Gov-
ernment is stressing that its “revolu-
tion” has completed what it began
last April.
In this assessment, at least, the rulers
of Greece are right. By the machinery
of its organisation and the identity of
the lower middle-class officers who
pushed the button, the April coup
d’etat was essentially anti-monarchist
in character. As it is now fairly well
established, the King and his own
circle of advisers and high-ranking
officers of the “aristocratic” Right
Wing were worried enough by the
deadlocked state of Greek politics and
threat of communist action to consider
a military intervention. But the chances
that the King would act virtually dis-
appeared when the proposal to hold
elecions in May offered a last hope
that the deadlock could be resolved
by parliamentary process.
It seemed inconceivable that the
King would use his command of the
armed forces to conduct a coup against
a Prime Minister as reputable and
loyally devoted to moderation as Mr.
Kanellopoulos, whom he had just ap-
pointed. It was at this moment, just
when all except the extreme fringes of
the Right believed that an end to two
years of political chaos might be in
sight, that the handful of junta officers
saw their chances slipping away and
forestalled the King by launching the
coup, which they had carefully planned
for several years.
In his proclamation to the Greek
people from a disused radio station in
Larissa, last Wednesday, the King con-
firmed that the colonels forged his sig-
nature to the first proclamation of the
regime. From the start, he was under
intolerable pressure. He might have
attempted an immediate repudiation of
the junta, with the risk of causing
bloodshed. He preferred the maxim: “If
you can’t beat ’em, join ’em.” But he
only appeared to join. And as a price
of sanctifying, the military takeover
with his name, he managed to win im-
portant concessions, especially the in-
clusion in the new government of loyal
Junta leader Papadopoulos giving his version of the King’s abortive counter-coup


Right-wing jurists, like the Prime
Minister, Mr. Kollias, who might assist
a gradual return to democratic gov-
ernment.
For eight months, under continuing
pressure and in isolation from his ac-
customed political advisers, the King
fought a rearguard action. He resisted
for as long as he could many of the
junta’s more extreme decisions which
required his signature, especially those
concerning the purge of the armed
forces which the junta was determined
to carry through. His hope was that
he could preserve enough ground from
which to launch a counter-attack at the
right time.
Now that the colonels are undisputed
masters of the country, what are they
likely to do wdth this new power?
So far the formal equipment of a
complete dictatorship (powers of cen-
sorship, arrest, administrative controls,
etc.) has been only partially exploited.
“Revolution” is not an inappropriate
word to describe the vast and penetrat-
ing changes which have been made in
the internal structure of the country,
in the name of eradicating corruption,
political jobbery, and communist in-
fluence. These changes are far-reaching
and have affected the personal lives of
many Greeks. But they are subter-
ranean in nature and have made it pos-
sible for foreign observers to marvel at
the apparent “normality” of Greece
after the coup.
In using powers which are more
likely to attract attention, and would
br less consistent with the claim that
Greece is not a dictatorship but has
a system, as one Minister has put it,
of “disciplined freedom,” the colonels
have been far more cautious. This
explains why foreign newspapers are
allowed to circulate, why listening to
foreign broadcasts is not punished.
Even so, the less pleasant aspects
even of a modified dictatorship had
already attracted widespread criticism
abroad. And some allegations about
the use of brutality by security police
has become the subject of official in-
vestigations abroad.
Is this use of total power likely now
to become more unrestrained? The first
signs after the collapse of the King’s
bid unfortunately suggest that it may.
There has been a new wave of arrests
of politicians, journalists, and former
palace officials. And there seems to
be an almost vindictive tendency to
stamp on anything and everyone con-
nected with the palace. The property
of all former and current palace offi-
cials, ladies-in-waiting, secretaries, and
advisers has now been confiscated by
the State, and banks have been instruc-
ted to refuse withdrawals of money
from their accounts. It seems a decision
has also been taken to disband the
Greek Scout and Girl Guide move-
ments, which have been patronised by
the royal family.
The factor which is most likely to
counsel restraint to the colonels is the
attitude of foreign governments, now
that the King has gone. Their anxiety
to win official foreign recognition is
suggested by the immediate claim that
there has been no break in constitu-
tional continuity although it was,
in effect, Colonel Papadopoulos who
appointed the regent, General Zoitakis,
and was in turn accorded “the honor
to be asked to lead his government.”
Moderate opposition to the regime
in Greece is in sad despair at the dis-
appearance of what they regarded as
the only hope of a non-violent removal
of the junta from power. They now
foresee an indefinite reign of the
colonels, with the long-term prospect
of an end which may be even more
disastrous. If a flicker of hope per-
sists, it is that the more frankly dic-
tatorial regime will not be able to
survive, politically or economically,
the isolation of Greece which would
result from a decision by her Western
allies to withhold their formal recog-
nition.
U.S. race relations
A summer to dread
THE JOHNSON administration is al-
ready preparing to send special armed
teams into the cities of the north to
make contingency plans for their
“pacification” in the event of race
rioting next summer.
Special attention is being given to
Chicago, which has a large Negro
population. Trouble is expected there
during the Democratic Party conven-
tion in August.
The contingency planning, a Penta-
gon spokesman said, stems from a re-
port to the President from Mr. Cyrus
Vance, the former Assistant Secretary
of Defence, who acted as the White
House troubleshooter in the Detroit
insurrection this summer. Mr. Vance
tops the list of possible successors to
Defence Secretary Robert McNamara.
Army commanders in all parts of
the country have been instructed to
hold “co-ordinating” meetings with
local officials to develop strategies for
pacification, the spokesman said.
Similar plans are drawn up for
natural disasters such as floods and
tornadoes, but special stress is now
being put on the racial crisis. The
idea is to prevent the confusion and
controversy that broke out this year
in Detroit. The situation in Detroit
was brought under control by Federal
forces after the National Guard
weekend soldiers had been accused
of a trigger-happy response to the
rioting. The Pentagon also wants
better training for the National Guard
in riot control.
The realisation is growing here that
racial violence could eclipse Vietnam as
the dominant issue of the 1968 presi-
dential campaign. White public
figures are making the gloomiest pre-
dictions about what is to come. Gover-
nor George Romney, of Michigan, who
is seeking the Republican nomination,
has said: “Most Negroes are waiting
to see if we mean what we say in
America, or whether they have got to
have a war of national liberation here.”
The President’s Commission of In-
quiry into this summer’s 130 racial
disorders this week announced that its
report will be published in March,
instead of next summer.
Dr. Martin Luther King has also
decided he cannot delay action until
the summer. Early in the spring he
plans a massive civil disobedience cam-
paign by poor Negroes in Washing-
ton —“a last resort for non-violence.”
He has appointed a tough young
Martin Luther King . . . he won’t wait
former field-secretary of the Student
Non-Violent Co-ordinating Committee
(Mr. Stokely Carmichael’s organisa-
tion) to direct the Washington cam-
paign. It is significant that in announc-
ing this appointment, Dr. King’s South-
ern Christian Leadership conference,
which is often regarded as moderate,
called itself “one of the most militant
civil rights organisations.”
Dr. King is training young activists
to travel to the capital to block the
entrances of Federal buildings includ-
ing the White House and the Capitol,
to demand jobs and an end to the
Vietnam war, which he blames for the
Negro Americans’ mood of despera-
tion. Although many white liberals
regard his strategy as dangerous and
provocative, he seems to have no alter-
native. For unless he adopts a militant
stand, the “burn, baby, burn”
philosophy of the Carmichaels and Rap
Browns will prevail in the ghettos.
Several great corporations are also
displaying a sense of urgency about
the racial situation. They are invest-
ing in ghetto projects in the hope that
they can help to stave off violence.


Cambodia
“Hot pursuit" soon
THE U.S. Government is condition-
ing public opinion for an extension of
the ground war in Vietnam into neutral
Cambodia. High-ranking State Depart-
ment officials concede publicly that the
administration is seriously considering
plans to give field commanders
authority for “hot pursuit” into Prince
Sihanouk’s kingdom.
The officials stress that the United
States does not want to “attack” or
invade Cambodia, but that it is pre-
pared to allow “hot pursuit” because
Cambodia is being used as a staging
and regrouping area for Viet Cong and
North Vietnamese actions in South
Vietnam.
Pressure for the “hot pursuit” policy
has been mounting in the Pentagon, in
Congress, and in Saigon.
On a recent television interview,
former President Eisenhower made a
strong recommendation for “hot
pursuit” into Cambodia. And when he
was home last month, the Commander
in Vietnam, General Westmoreland,
told a select group of correspondents
that he wanted to “quarantine” Cam-
bodia. '
A powerful, hawk-dominated Con-
gressional Committee last week urged
that steps should be taken immediately
to make it impossible for the Com-
munists to continue using Cambodia
as a “sanctuary.”
Declaring that progress in the war
was “much too slow,” Representative
L. Mendel Rivers, Chairman of the
Armed Services Committee, described
the situation in Cambodia as “intoler-
able.”
President Nguyen Van Thieu said
earlier this month that his South Viet-
namese forces should cross into Cam-
bodia in pursuit of the Viet Cong.
Genetic research
No little green
monsters yet
THE REAL significance of the experi-
ments by Nobel Prize winner Dr.
Arthur Kornberg and his team at Stan-
ford University, California, is that they
open the way to manufacturing arti-
ficial genes, the units of heredity.
There is no question of creating “test-
tube life” any more than a publisher
who prints a book has synthesised a
novel.
What Dr. Kornberg’s group has done
is to set up a kind of biological dupli-
cating machine. They inserted into it
the genetic material of a virus which
infects bacteria and ran off a large
number of copies, which proved as in-
fectious as the original. The duplica-
tion process was controlled and oper-
ated by a complex enzyme a protein
also extracted from a virus, which
manages the copying process in nature
as well.
Thus there now exists a test-tube
system which can duplicate samples of
genetic material. It is this, evidently,
which prompted President Johnson to
speak of an “awesome accomplish-
ment.” It has also set off much specu-
lative comment about possible cancer
cures or treatments for hereditary
diseases, which is misleading and
wholly premature.
The real situation is that there now
exists a further powerful tool for prob-
ing the detailed anatomy of living pro-
cesses. These processes are controlled
by segments of genetic material - the
genes in the nuclei, of living cells.
It may become possible to isolate
particular genes and modify them, or
assemble artificial genes and duplicate
them by the Stanford method in the
test tube.
The next step would be to insert
such test-tube genes into living cells,
to change their hereditary properties
deliberately. One method might be to
induce the genes to behave like a virus
and “infect” the host cell. It is already
known that some viruses can penetrate
a cell and incorporate themselves into
its genetic mechanism, producing, in
effect, a cell which is a mutant. Some
viruses may produce forms of cancer
in this way.
It will be many years until such
possibilities have been thoroughly
explored. Still further off is the pros-
pect of exploiting these laboratory
techniques for medical or social pur-
poses.
It is intriguing to speculate about
genetic surgery the removal of
deleterious genes from the ova and
sperm of a couple so that their
children would not be threatened with
some inherited defect. One may
imagine laboratory-tailored viruses
with which to infect a foetus or small
child with some desirable genetic
feature.
But molecular biologists are unani-
mous that there must be a great deal
more laborious fundamental research
before the real possibilities are clear.
The Stanford work is almost identi-
cal to an experiment completed two
years ago by Professor Sol Spiegel-
mann and his group at the University
of Illinois, where the genetic material
of a virus was also duplicated in a
test tube.
The difference is that the Illinois
group used a small virus whose genetic
material consisted of RNA (ribonuc-
leic acid), whereas Dr. Kornberg and
his group have used a virus containing
DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid), which
Dr. Kornberg announcing the feat
is the genetic substance of all higher
organisms, from bacteria upwards.
The Stanford gene - duplicating
system will thus be a very powerful
tool for many fundamental investiga-
tions but there is no prospect at
present of using it to cure cancer or
to make little, green monsters in the
test tube.
The United Nations
Exit Goldberg
THE MYSTERY about Mr. Arthur
Goldberg’s coming resignation from
the Ambassadorship to the United
Nations is not why he should want to
go but why President Johnson is will-
ing to let him go. The best guess is
that the President decided that if Mr.
Goldberg insisted on going, it had
better be well before the election; Feb-
ruary is the date being suggested.
Clearly Mr. Goldberg is now dis-
satisfied with his job. He has not found
the Ambassadorship worth the sacri-
fice of his Supreme Court seat; unfor-
tunately he cannot return there not
directly, anyway. He is expected to
join a private law firm and make some
money. For some time he has been
disillusioned about the usefulness of
what he can accomplish at the United
Nations. As a Jew he is distrusted by
the Arabs and has thus been able to
do little about the troubles in the
Middle East. Although he is a member
of the President’s Cabinet he has
attended seldom and his impact on
foreign policy has been slight.
Most disappointingly, while he has
talked about opening up avenues of
negotiation with the North Vietnamese,
so far he has not been permitted to do
so. The report of his resignation coin-
cided with the news that the National
Liberation Front, the political arm of
the rebels in South Vietnam, had been
seeking to send spokesmen to the
United Nations.
All the earlier rumors of a split be-
tween Hanoi and the NLF and of pos-

sible readiness to compromise have
been slapped down in Washington,
although the United States is ready
for representatives of the NLF to visit
the United Nations under an official
invitation. The Administration has to
tread a careful course between the
Saigon Government and critics in the
Senate and elsewhere.
More and more of them are accus-
ing the President of not doing as much
as he might to open negotiations; the
newest is Senator Dirksen, the Repub-
lican leader, previously a close ally of
Mr. Johnson’s on this matter. It now
looks as if Mr. Goldberg may not even
be able to put the question of Vietnam
to the Security Council before he
leaves the United Nations, as the
Senate has demanded. But if so, this
will not be because the President is
unwilling for it to be done but because
the necessary nine votes cannot be
obtained in the Council.
India
Two languages are
better than one
INDIA’S POLITICAL leaders deserve,
for once, full marks. They have decided
to maintain both Hindi and English as
official languages for an indefinite
period in an attempt to satisfy both
Hindi- and non-Hindi-speaking States.
The basic ingredient of the formula
is that the Federal Government will
continue to work in English as well as
Hindi, the official language designated
by the Indian constitution, until all
non-Hindi-speaking States decide other-
wise. In effect, this gives the power
of veto to any State which chooses not
to fall in line. Some politicians pressed
for a deadline or for whittling down
the veto by stipulating that it should
be permissible to drop English if two-
thirds of the non-Hindi States agreed.
Eut, recognising strong anti-Hindi sen-
timents in Madras, Mrs. Gandhi, with
tacit support of all parties, is retaining
the veto provision unchanged. This is
more than her father, Mr. Nehru, dared
to do. In 1963 he assured non-Hindi
States that English would continue
until they decided otherwise, but he
did not put this into law.
The pictures of students making bon-
fires of English street signs give a
misleading impression of general
student attitudes. Even at universities
where it is permissible to opt out of
English, the great bulk of students have
not in fact done so. An expert commis-
sion on education has strongly recom-
mended to State Governments that
English should be retained as the
“library” language at college level so
that students taught in any of India’s
14 languages may be able to make up
for lack of study materials by relying
on literature in English.

AUSTRALIA AND
NEW ZEALAND BANK
LIMITED
Highlights from the Chairman’s Statement for the year ended 30th Sept., 1967
The Bank’s steady expansion continues.
Thirty-two new branches opened.
Group profits up 23%.
Trading and Savings Bank deposits rose by
$AlO9m.
Trading Bank advances increased by 14%.
Savings Bank advances (mainly housing)
now exceed $AlOOm.
DEVALUATION. The Australian Government’s
decision not to follow sterling is to be com-
mended as correct. It will undoubtedly en-
hance Australia’s international credit stand-
ing. It is also evidence of Australia’s encour-
aging long-term outlook.
ECONOMIC PROSPECTS. Australia is enter-
ing a period of economic progress that may
even surpass the impressive developments of
the past two decades. The demand for capital
to finance this development will surely inten-
sify in the near future, and the flow of funds
from traditional sources, the United Kingdom
and the United States of America, at present
restricted, is likely to be supplemented by an
increasing flow from other countries, particu-
larly Japan.
MINERAL DEVELOPMENT. During 1966-67 the
Australian mineral industry recorded further
rapid expansion. Its vital contribution has
come at a time when an increasing proportion
of resources is being, and will have to be, de-
voted to defence, foreign aid and trade pro-
motion in Asia.
A.N.Z. Bank is closely associated with these
mineral developments through its banking
connections with drilling companies, its large-
scale lending to finance important mineral
ventures, its “outpost” branches near the
main projects and its oil and mineral advisory
services.
NEW BANKING SERVICES. The establish-
ment. of Australian Resources Development
Bank Ltd. is of wide significance to the
economy generally and especially to the
banking system. This new institution will
enable A.N.Z. Bank to give increased sup-
port to large-scale development projects.
A significant development on the international
scene has been the formation of an organisa-
tion to provide intercontinental banking ser-
vices which A.N.Z. Bank has joined in con-
junction with oversea banks. This new
organisation will enable member banks more
readily to give each other mutual support on
a consortium basis for the financing of large
operations, which might otherwise have been
beyond the scope of any one bank.
The Bank thanks its customers for their continued goodwill and co-operation.

BUSINESS AND FINANCE
A package deal to cushion
devaluation’s hurts
IT WILL PROBABLY turn out to be
a fairly good package for the industries
concerned; and those who saw Mr.
McEwen’s devaluation antics last week
as aimed largely at getting a good deal
out of the Government for affected
industries will be inclined to thank Mr.
McEwen for the benefits to be received
rather than the Liberal side of the
coalition.
The package is in two parts: one
that is here and now and another whose
details are to be decided on after inves-
tigation by bodies whose appropriate-
ness for the task is not always evident.
In both parts of the package the'hand
of Mr. McEwen seems fairly large.
Among the immediate decisions was one
to recompense the Wheat Board for the
$3O million it lost on sterling contracts.
Another is that manufacturers, who
face problems not only in exporting to
devalued countries like New Zealand
but also in competing with exports of
devalued countries in third markets, are
now given an increase (from 37£ per-
cent to percent) in the proportion
of export market development costs-
they can deduct from income tax as
part of the new five-year payroll-tax
export incentive scheme that begins
from next July. And there is to be
urgent aid (yet to be decided) to the
canned fruit industry.
But the most striking feature of the
second half of the package is that most
of the inquiries into what is needed to
solve the devaluation problems will be
conducted by representatives of the
industries that are affected. The
appointment of the Country Party’s
Mr. J. D. Anthony, the Minister for
Primary Industry, to head an inquiry
into the fundamental problems of rural
industries, involving consideration of
the reconstruction of some industries,
particularly the dairy industry, follows
J. D. Anthony . . . rural fundamentals
the pattern set by the appointment of
industry panels under the Associated
Chamber of Manufactures of Australia
to tell the Government what should be
done for manufacturing industry both
internally and in exports. (These panels
will report through Mr. McEwen’s
Department of Trade and Industry.)
Mr. Anthony’s inquiry will be to con-
sider how uneconomic small farmers
could be helped either to build up their
holdings or leave the industry.
But Mr. Holt had not gone all the
way with Mr. McEwen; he had kept
under his own wing the all-important
committee of three top public servants
who are to begin an immediate
examination of devaluation problems in
rural industries. The three men in the
Holt team are the permanent head of
\two “Country Party” departments,
Trade’s Sir Alan Westerman and Pri-
mary Industry’s Mr. A. C. B. Maiden,
and deputy-secretary of the Treasury,
Mr. M. W. O’Donnell. This team is to
recommend governmental action on
demonstrable and unavoidable losses
from devaluation; it is to draw a nice
dividing line between the “devaluation”
problems of rural industries and their
“fundamental” problems that are Mr.
Anthony’s preserve.
But Mr. Holt’s death has significantly
changed the implications of this
arrangement; the next Liberal leader
may well take a much stronger stand
against the Country Party than Mr.
Holt, who had, in the main, carried
on the tradition of sweet reasonable-
ness to Mr. McEwen, which seemed
largely a consequence of Sir Robert
Menzies’ old debt to McEwen for his
support in Menzies’ battle against the
late Sir Archie Cameron and Sir Earle
Page a quarter of a century ago. It
is possible that the urgency of the
committee’s investigations may be
affected by the uncertainty about the
person to whom it will ultimately be
reporting (and, of course, by the holi-
day period); it is highly unlikely that
the Liberal Party would be prepared
to see the investigators reporting to
Mr. McEwen during his time at the
top.
Loloma-Great Boulder
A clarification and a clearance
THE CHAIRMAN’S ADDRESS at
the recent annual meeting of Loloma
Mining Corporation cleared the air on
several matters. Particularly, it proved
as unfounded earlier inferences that the
directors had used their common link
with Great Boulder to ensure that
Loloma’s recent sales of Great Boulder
shares were effected at an artificial
high. As custodians of Loloma’s exten-
sive investment portfolio, they appear
to have done what any other prudent
large-scale investor would have done —
cover their company, in part at least.
That the Loloma directors enjoyed no
special insight or privilege is evident
from the remarks made by the chair-
man, Mr. N. B. Theodore:
“In order to protect the general
market for Great Boulder, the selling
was made slowly and in stages. Begin-
ning in July, a total of 109,500 shares
were sold (most sales occurring in Sep-
tember) with the final sales on
October 16, 1967. Like other sellers,
we had to take the rough with the
smooth, and during that time our sales
varied between a high of $4.15 and a
low of $2.20, giving an average of $3.36
per share. For the Loloma shareholders,
obviously we would have been happier
to have enjoyed the benefit of the price
rises which subsequently occurred after
Great Boulder discovered its high metal
values in mid-October. That, however,
is ‘second guessing’ and I feel it in no
way affects the wisdom of the invest-
ment decision made earlier.”
So while it is true that the “little
bloke” was getting his fingers burned
speculating in nickel boom stocks, at
least one “bigger bloke” was not doing
all that well, either. In any event,
the speculators had plenty of warning;
they preferred to go chasing every
rumor, although over the past six
months or so, Great Boulder had, in
four Press releases, drawn attention
either to the prevalence of inaccurate
rumors about its operations or to the
fact that considerably more work was
needed to evaluate the prospect accur-
ately. Also, a little study of the Great
Boulder annual report (issued three
weeks before the meeting) should have
indicated the possibility of a new issue,
The present reverse cash flow could
scarcely be expected to finance the
exploration program foreshadowed in
that report.


THE WEEK BRIEFLY
F Or the economy : The Leader of the Country Party
(and Minister for Trade), Mr. John McEwen, forcefully
voiced his objections to the Government’s decision not to
devalue the Australian dollar; in direct response, the Prime
Minister, Mr. Holt, defended the move, saying “we had
no case to make for devaluation but we did have confidence
in the strength of our own currency” . . . The Government
has decided to develop a program to cushion both primary
and manufacturing industries against harm from sterling’s
devaluation.
Higher award margins were granted by the Arbitration
Commission to metal trades employees in its “work value”
decision, leading immediately to a difference between
employers and unions as to whether the new margins would
be absorbed in existing over-award payments . . . The Full
High Court has upheld the concept of the total wage.
A 12J percent freight increase imposed by the European-
U.K. shipping conference has been disputed by a host of
Australian exporters, and Mr. McEwen; opposition by the
Australian Meat Board led to shippers refusing to load any
more carton meat.
For the markets ; Following three days of marked
and widespread decline (penetrating all sections) Austra-
lian share markets steadied a little on Thursday and Friday
(December 14 and 15); turnovers remain fairly slim.
Engineering, electrical and gold issues helped London
to forge ahead again; fixed-interest and gilts weakened . . .
The international and domestic monetary climate worried
Wall Street into a series of fractional retreats.
For companies : The week got off very well when
ICIANZ announced at its beginning that 1966-67 profits
had gone up 12 percent to a record $10,607,000 on sales
up by eight percent to $294 million; a steady 1\ percent
dividend is based upon a 10.8 percent earning rate . . .
Then, right at the end, cigarette maker Philip Morris came
out with a percent interim payment on bonus-increased
capital, just as forecast; a full 11 percent would be equiva-
lent to 16J percent pre-bonus .. . Associated Pulp and Paper
Mills’ previously foreshadowed issue is to be one-for-four
at par, to raise (with an employee issue) $5,616,000.
The good news was continued by Western Mining Cor-
poration, which is experiencing higher head grades of nickel
at Kambalda . . . Alcan Australia’s aluminium smelter at
Kurri Kurri (N.S.W.) will draw more than half of its $36
million cost from Australian institutions, which finally attain
a 29.5 percent equity; a more broadly public issue can’t be
expected before 1971 . . . The Savage River (Tas.) iron-ore
project has started pellet production.
Tractor and farm implement maker Massey-Ferguson
sent 1966-67 earnings from $1,618,411 to $2,516,310 when
sales advanced $5 million to $42.7 million; the prevailing-
short-term outlook seems, to directors, “less encouraging.”
A rather more encouraging outlook is proclaimed by
retailer Anthony Hordern, budgeting for “quite a material
improvement in net profit”; the 1967-68 year to date is in
line . . . Soft ice-cream maker Mr. Whippy may be wound
up in two months or go on from its “desperate position” by
means of “quite extraordinary and generous” aid from the
major shareholder, Britain’s Forte group.
The finance wing enthuses, with even the Bank of New
South Wales opining that, if needful, “the banks are in a
position to assist with a mild stimulus to the economy-
through a moderate credit expansion” . . . General Credits
looks expansive enough with earnings for the first half of
1967-68 some 29 percent above corresponding 1966-67 levels.
MEN AND MATTERS
THE GOVERNMENT WILL be
coming in for a lot more high-class
nagging about its overseas buying of
electronic defence equipment follow-
ing the appointment of Sir Samuel
Jones as chairman of the Australian
Telecommunications Development
Association. Sir Samuel, the 62-year-
old managing director of Standard
Telephones and Cables Pty Ltd. (local
offshoot of the world-wide International
Telephone and Telegraph Co.), is very
keen to increase the dribble of defence
contracts now coming the way of Aus-
tralian telecommunications companies
into a worthwhile stream.
Because of the lack of support by
our defence services, Sir Samuel claims,
Australia’s general level of technical
competence is falling behind that of
other countries, and that the electronics
industry is running down. Dismissing
the constant cry that a lack of quantity
in defence demands would make the
cost of producing specialised equip-
bient prohibitive, he says that only
with the experience gained from local
manufacture of this equipment would
Australia be in a position to meet the
demands of modern technology in
industrial development.
Sir Samuel, an engineer, whose first
job was as a junior mechanic with the
Post Office 40 years ago, was born
in Frankston and educated at War-
racknabeal High and Melbourne
University. After spending the 12 years
to 1939 in the PMG, he was in the
Army Signals Unit as a lieutenant-
colonel until 1941, when he became
CSO Home Forces and then director
radio and signals supplies with the
Ministry of Munitions for the last
three years of the war. After it he
joined Philips Electrical Industries as
technical manager and became its
technical director in 1950, before
moving over to rival STC as managing
director in 1961.
MONUMENTS ABOUND around
Australia and N.Z. to the architectural
skills of Sir Arthur Stephenson, who
died a few weeks ago at 77. They in-
elude countless hospitals for whose de-
sign he was famous, including the
Royal Melbourne and Children’s in his
native city, and, of all relics, the Mel-
bourne Town Hall, which he redesign-
ed after it was burnt down in the 19205,
an d, following a contretemps with her,
satisfied Melba on its acoustics. Sir
Arthur started his own firm, now
Stephenson and Turner, in Melbourne,
on his return from World War II
(with the DSO), ultimately building it
into the biggest firm of architects in
the British Commonwealth, with some
300 architects on its payroll and offices
in most of our big cities and also in
Sir Samuel Jones
P. Stephenson
N.Z. Looking after its affairs now will
be his son Peter, 45, latterly deputy
chairman of the partnership, and, like
his father, from Melbourne Grammar.
From Grammar, Peter went straight
into the RAAF and then to Melbourne
University, where he graduated in
architecture and took a postgraduate
course in town planning. He followed
that with a Fulbright to Harvard, in the
U.S., where he studied under the re-
nowned Walter Gropius, taking his
masters degree back home, where he
has since acquired fellowships of the
Royal Australian Institute of Archi-
tects and the Institute of Management.
Mr. Stephenson has yet to get the
medal of the British Institute of Archi-
tects like his father did (the only Aus-
tralian to have done so).


An option for Christmas
By SPECULATOR
WANT A NOVEL GIFT suggestion
for Christmas? All right, then how
about a Stock Option? Anyone with the
touch of the wheeler-dealer will love
them. Nine out of ten people you give
them to probably won’t have a clue
about what they are, but the $ signs
will be a strong incentive to learn. This
is the sort of education, when there is
a chance of making a buck, that every-
one enjoys.
Options are nothing more or less
than a written undertaking. It is what
they undertake to do that is the im-
portant part. They undertake to guar-
antee that the person who is the option
holder will be entitled to buy or sell
(or both) a share at a certain quoted
price regardless of the level of the Stock
Exchange. Very handy when you are
entitled to buy a share for $2.45 when
it is selling to everyone else on the
market for $5.33. However, more of
that later on. This privilege of being
allowed to operate the market at a pre-
stated price does not, unfortunately, go
on for ever. Like Cinderella’s coach, it
disappears after a prespecified time. The
length of the time you are allowed to
operate under such privileged condi-
tions is not related to what the Fairy
Godmother said but to the more mun-
dane criterion of how much you paid
for your option in the first place. Like
anything else, the more you pay for it
the longer you can enjoy it.
Well, so much for the generalities.
Let’s get down to tintacks. The number
one decision to make when buying
options is which particular variety you
would like to have. Firstly there is the
most commonly used model, the Call
Option. This model is like the Holden
everyone has one. It undertakes to
give you the right to buy a stock for a
certain specified future period of time
(generally one, three, or six months)
at the same price the stock was selling
for on the day you took out your
option. When your friendly chairman
tells you (“off the record, of course,
old boy”) that in six weeks’ time the
board is going to announce the greatest
profit in the company’s history and
that the shares are going to rocket,
it is then the time for buying call
options (provided you believe the old
boy, of course).
Secondly comes the Put Option. This
is merely a call option in reverse. It
allows you to sell a share at the price
which was ruling on the day on which
you bought the option. Thus if you
expect that, when the G.B. company
has its annual meeting in three weeks’
time, it will be announced that the
large deposits of nickel strongly
rumored to be on their reserves have
turned out to be only fool’s gold, you
then have a pretty good reason for
loading up with put options.
Next comes the Double Option. This
little model carries the same rights as
both the put and call options; that is,
you may either sell or buy at the
price ruling on the day you bought the
option. However, the catch is that you
have to make up your mind which way
you will go; that is, will you sell or
will you buy, because once having
moved one way, you cannot change
your mind and go in the other direc-
tion. This is definitely one for the
confused mind.
Last, but not least, comes the Lulu
of them all, the Straddle Option. This
one is great for the bouncy market. It
allows you to both buy and sell. It is a
call, put, and double option all rolled
into one. For a stock which fluctuates
in wild swings, straddle options can
quite often be a profitable investment.
As well as making good gimicky
Christmas presents, options can also
be very useful tools for investors to
protect their investments and their
profits. Whether this method of protec-
tion is economically feasible or not is
something the individual investor has to
figure out for himself. Just for the
record, however, here are some of the
ways options can be used as a hedge
by investors. Now suppose that you
own a stock that has behaved like a
balloon filled with helium ever since
you bought it and. you now think it is
time to count your blessings and get
out. You feel that the jolly good profit
you have made should be turned from
a paper one into a cash one. At the
same time your greedy streak keeps
nagging at you to hang on for even
better things; at the same time you re-
member how many times in the past
you sold out too early and saw your
stocks go higher when they weren’t
your stocks any more. Well, it is here’
that the call option comes to the
rescue. It allows you to have your cake
and eat it, too.
All you do is sell your shares and
take out your hard-earned profit, but
at the same time' cut yourself in for
any future rises by purchasing a call
option for the same number of shares
you have just sold. Thus, if the shares
continue to rise you merely exercise
your option to buy at the price you
initially sold out at and then immedi-
ately sell the shares off once again at
the new improved price, pocketing the
additional profits. An alternative way
of achieving the same thing is to hang
on to your shares and to buy a put
option. Thus, if the shares go up you
have still got them in your hot little
hand and can take the higher profit
as is your due for the heart strain in-
volved; whereas if they go down, all
you do is merely exercise your put
option. This means you can flog off
the shares at the old price, which you
thought was pretty good, anyway, and
still have a pretty healthy sort of profit.
Well, up to here we have discussed
the types and some of the uses for
options, but the most important factor
of all has not yet even been touched.
That is the price. Naturally, the cost
of an option will have a large bearing
on whether or not the above uses are a
feasible proposition or not. The cost of
an option is not a fixed item but varies
with supply and demand, with market
conditions, and with any special circum-
stances that are likely to affect the price
of a share. Generally speaking, however,
it would be fair to say that the cost of
a three months’ put or call option on
an average industrial stock would be
around 10 percent of the stock’s quoted
price. Doubles and straddles are about
13 to 14 percent. The cost, of course,
varies with the length of the option
period.
Option costs for mining stocks are
another thing. As would be expected,
they are much more expensive than
the industrial variety. The price of a
three-month put or call mining option
is usually in the vicinity of 15-20 per-
cent of current market price. This may
seem a pretty expensive sort of pre-
mium. Yet when viewed in the light
of some of the gains experienced by
miners over the past 12 months, it does
not seem so unreasonable. Just think
of the prices of BHP, Western Min-
ing, and Great Boulder as at 12 months
ago, and you will realise what a cheap
and profitable present a call option in
those stocks would have made last
Yule.
And there is no doubt that the chance
of making really big money is greater
with buying stock options than in buy-
ing the shares themselves. If you had
spent $4OOO buying six-month call
options in BHP six months ago you
would have got options on about 830
shares giving you the right to buy
them at any stage in the past six months
at $8.50. You could have exercised
this option and then sold the shares
for $l7 last month, bringing you in a
massive $14,000, or 14 times your
original outlay. But if you had pre-
ferred to buy the shares themselves
rather than the options you would only
have doubled your money. That is an
example of their working your way.
But in the past most options taken out
have not been exercised because the
shares have not moved far enough to
cover their costs. And that means you
lose all your stake. So they can be a
good way of losing money, too.

THE
CROESUS
TOUCH
Fitting work
values to
the economy
BY J. C. HORSFALL
OH TO BE A FITTER now that
Christmas is here! A lot of muddy
water is going to pass under the in-
dustrial relations bridges between now
and January 22, when he and all the
other quarter of a million or so metal
tradesmen’s work-value hand-outs from
the Arbitration Commission are
scheduled to flow that is, if last
week’s preliminary skirmishes on the
banks of the industrial river are any-
thing to go by. But whether the rise
of up to a bit more than $lO a week in
some cases is going to be at least in
part absorbed in present over-award
payments or not, it shows that Mr.
Hawke was drawing a very short bow
indeed six months ago in regretting the
Commission had introduced the total
wage, as he claimed, before implement-
ing an undertaking to finish the work-
values cases first. . *
If this result isn’t exactly leapfrog-
ging of the old variety so dear to Mr.
Hawke, the effective result looks al-
most superior from the unions’ view-
point, even if, obviously, the Federal
Government, as well as employers ex-
pected to swell the pay packets, are
not taking it - lying down. The latter
have also been given a lever from the
Commission to absorb the increase in
over-a\vard payments, but this was
available under the old dichotomy of
basic wage and margins cases also. As
for “flow on,” well, it doesn’t matter
much what the Commission actually
says about that, because all the other
unions write their own invitations to the
fitters’ party.
With so much fire under the indus-
trial-relations pot in the new circum-
stances created by the decision, nobody
would care to put a figure on the
likely lift to the riational wages bill,
nor all the sectional industry bills, but
employers have every reason to be
indignant at the Commission for this
third step-up in award wages in a
12-month period. This latest increase
makes nonsense of its decision last June
to have a holiday in total wage adjust-
ments until next August, something the
Federal Government had laid great
store on in its economic planning and
which was particularly germane to the
decision not to devalue the dollar along
with sterling last month. As well as
the delayed-action bombs going off on
the latter last week, on the return of
Mr. McEwen, the new fuses now set by
the Commission are a bit too much for
the best of economic planners.
It isn’t as if those guiding our
economic destinies didn’t have enough
on their plates already, following the
devaluations, especially in contemplat-
ing the likely cost (measured, if you
like, in domestic prices terms) of the
Government’s plan to compensate, by
way of subsidies, tariffs, and so forth,
industries whose incomes and viability
are going to be adversely affected—all
of which is right and proper, of course,
and in the best Australian tradition.
The latter demands that the various
parts of the economy must expect to do
their duty to their brothers, wayward
and innocently victimised by circum-
stances alike, at the behest of govern-
ments determined to do their best for
all at whatever the necessary financial
cost. Only Opposition shadow ministers
can afford to. take ,an economically
holier-than-thou approach • as Dr.
Cairns did the other night on “Fight-
ing Words,” a Melbourne TV program,
when he stated it was important that
assistance of this sort should be tem-
porary, thinking perhaps, as a spund
economist, that it certainly shouldn’t
be crystallised into structural distor-
tions in the economy (however difficult
it is to distinguish these from the real
thing), even if you can bet your bottom
dollar that they will be. Anyway, the
cost, temporary or otherwise, has to be
met and will come home to roost in
the domestic cost-and-price structures,
precisely the homing spots for untoward
wage increases.
•At this stage, and even if such assis-
tance proves to be only temporary,
coupled with the new boost to wage
incomes, it makes the danger of con-
tinuing price inflation and the hoisting
of the whole economy on to a more
elevated price platform look greater
than ever. The devaluations themselves,
and our wisdom in not following them,
first encouraged one to think that here
was “the stopper” to the emerging pros-
pect of the economy becoming over-
heated next year. But if we are to
avoid this happeniftg we seem to be
going the wrong way about it, offset-
ting at critical turns the implied anti-
inflationary implications of the decision
not to devalue. However, if fine carl
only blame the Federal Government if
its measures to offset the effects of the
devaluations on sectional incomes even-
tually look too liberal and permanent,
we can’t blame it for this latest boost
to wages. -
There is nothing all that obvious the
authorities can do, apart, perhaps, from
increasing taxation to minimise the in-
flationary effects. But at least there is
something they can do to reap some
of the fruits of sterling devaluation and
that is to move rapidly toward the
abolition of Imperial preferences.
Indeed, I should think the pressure is
already on them to to do so from
Japan our biggest export market
now—arid the United States. These two
countries in particular are now faced
with heightened competition from
British goods in the Australian market.
British goods are not only getting the
higher British preferential tariff rate,
but also have the lever of a 14.3 per-
cent price advantage to help them in
the Australian market.
One wouldn’t expect Australian
firms to get ths full 14.3 percent re-
duction in prices of imports from
Britain following sterling devaluation,
because obviously British exporters will
contrive to squeeze the maximum ad-
vantage from having a devalued pound
to help them. On the other hand, if we
are to get anything out of the de-
valuation play, this is the one essential
area to get it. Moreover, it so happens
that from the viewpoints both of our
balance of payments and the need to
contain price inflation here, a substan-
tial reduction in the cost of imports
from Britain (about 30 percent of our
total imports) would be most salutary.
Where Britain enjoys practically a
monopoly advantage, such as in ship-
ping, there is not all that much we
can do about it, as the post-devaluation
rises in freight rates forced upon us
show only too clearly.
But we could get into the fight by
removing or threatening to abolish
Imperial preferences, something we are
most likely to do eventually, anyway,
if Britain joins the Common Market.
Why not foreshadow such an event
now? At any rate it should be con-
sidered without too much delay. Re-
cently a trade mission went to Britain
to negotiate a new trade agreement;
apparently it made little progress in
its negotiations. The threat of abolish-
ing Imperial preference has long been
a trump card to be played in such
negotiations. Now would seem the time
to issue an ultimatum.


WILD CAT PAGES
Some “good specs” for 1968
MINING • SHARE LIST • BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS
MARKET POINTERS • SECURITY ANALYSIS • COMMODITIES
By JASON
IT WAS QUITE A YEAR for the
speculators. The mining and oil lists
are full of stocks that bounced up and
down like yo-yos through 1967. And
despite some burned fingers toward the
end, most made a fair bit of money- —
particularly those who had bought
stocks like BHP as a good, safe invest-
ment and suddenly found themselves
oil speculators.
But despite the success of our own
“Speculator” there was not much
speculative excitement in the non-
mining sections of the market. That
does not mean there is no scope for
speculating; far from it. There are a
few fairly cheap “good specs” on the
lists that could prove rewarding in 1968.
And these are quite apart from the
opportunities that may exist among the
“rubbish”—the stocks that are selling
for less than 10 cents and which some
investors have found to be a rewarding
area of activity. There are plenty of
cheap stocks that could improve; at
least there is not much to lose in buy-
ing such depressed shares as ODE,
Besser, Bliss-Welded, Jayworth, Latec,
and Federated Industries—all of which
have seen better times in the past and
could do so again. But the three best
cheap “punts” in the industrial market
for my money right now are United
Telecasters, Concrete Industries, and
George Hudson.
United Telecasters is a bit of a
roughie. But the current rights issue is
clearly a depressant on the market, and
when it is over the company’s takeover
appeal may well bring appreciably
higher prices. In any event, it does
seem to have a chance of doing a bit
better in 1967-68 than in its previous
loss years.
Concrete Industries will make some
reasonable profits this year if it can
concentrate its activities on the job in
hand; there have been too many dis-
tractions in recent times, what with
board fights and continual legal claims
against the U.S. Navy over the North
West Cape project. Concrete Industries
should end up doing moderately well
out of both these disturbances. Its
share price looks about due for a 50
percent rise or so next year.
George Hudson has hit the bottom;
admittedly it was with quite a thud,
but after the latest loss, things should
begin to improve. And if they don’t,
then the 15 cents the shares cost looks
pretty small alongside the assets back-
ing of 51 cents, a great deal of which
is pretty realistic.
A few readers have wqnderd how
on earth I could have recommended
Woolworths and William Adams in last
week’s list of stocks that could rise in
1968; they consider these two would
be more likely tq remain the dreary
performers they were in 1967. I dis-
agree. Woolworths’ dividend yield of
5.2 percent is not a bad rate of return
while waiting for the good times to
come again for this stock. And don’t
forget that Woolworths has a history
of doing the right thing by its share-
holders.
William Adams shares have got even
cheaper in the past week; at prices
around $1.70, their lowest for many
years, they give the remarkable divi-
dend yield of 7.4 percent on the 121-
percent dividend that directors expect
to maintain. The market is so wrapped,
up with Adams’ Caterpillar mess that
it seems to have ignored the other
parts of this successful business, like
distributing steel and aluminium.
The significant thing about the
latest result is that it has come at a
time when official statistics show there
has been little growth in private fixed
expenditure, which provides the bulk
of William Adams’ demand. Capital
spending is forecast to improve con-
siderably in the current quarter and
the New Year (when lots of new issues
are forecast to finance expansion).
There should be another 40 or 50 cents
in Williams Adams for 1968.
THE CHARTIST furnishes a further
comment on BHP, which has now de-
cisively penetrated the steep inter-
mediate 400 percent uptrend held since
April, 1967. Support has now formed
about the $14.40 level and any pene-
tration could result in a decline to about
$12.00. However, the broad overall pri-
mary uptrend remains intact and an
overall sideways movement could follow
for some time until market action deter-
mines a further move of major im-
portance.
By the way, the big buyer of six-
month stock options in BHP eased up
a bit last week, only taking in another
5000 at a cost of $11,500 and at an
exercise price of between SI4J to $l5.
The previous week he had bought
20,000-odd. Since early in November
there have been 80,000 six-month calls
taken out on BHP (apparently by one
buyer) costing about $190,000 and
The Chartist says:
HANIMEX CORPORATION LIMITED could become a “devaluation” stock
in view of recent market action. It has been an interesting technical performer
and the past history back to 1960 shows the commencement of an uptrend about
the middle of 1961, which continued at a rate of approximately 60 percent per
annum in a “growth” phase until the decisive break in trend in October, 1964.
Consolidation followed arid a new high was recorded late in 1965. However, once
again market action determined penetration about September, 1967, but this
was “suspect” because it was not accompanied by high turnover. During the past
few weeks the downtrend has accelerated close to the 90c target and support
level on heavy volume. There is a possibility of a further decline to the 50c
level, where the situation would call for reassessment. Last sale price on
14/12/67 $l.Ol.


covering BHP shares worth $1.2 million
at current prices (which will have to
rise by an average of more than $3 to
about $2O a share before most of them
begin to make money).
The Melbourne market
Too like a casino
SO FIRMLY IN SIGHT of their own
fat turkeys were Melbourne stock-
brokers last week that they almost for-
got to invite the Press to their dinner,
the first annual one of its kind in this
city. The holding of a dinner was no
less surprising than the belated after-
thought nod to the Press to attend it.
Seldom, as the annual report attests,
have the brokers had it so good as in
1967 and seldom has their public rela-
tions been so bad.
Doing his strong silent act, the
present chairman of the Exchange,
Mr. C. T. Looker, who was re-elected
last week, just doesn’t seem to care
what the public thinks about the
present casino-like goings-on at all.
With their tills rattling more merrily
than ever this year, most (but not all)
of his fellow brokers have been pre-
pared to go along with his dictum
that “silence is golden.” This is just
not good enough. Just as the chairman
should look more to the Exchange’s
public laurels, so also should the com-
mittee to the warnings especially
Mr. Jack Galbally’s demand for a ten-
year survey of the details of stock
exchange transactions.
The year’s bonanza for brokers is
spelt out boldly in the Exchange’s
annual report. If, in the last month
since its printing, the uncertainties
thrown up by sterling devaluation have
clipped the wings of some of the high
mining fliers and brought industrials a
bit closer to the ground, the down-
swing has been just as rewarding in
commissions as the other tack. The
report revels in the record figures for
turnovers and prices, and takes the
story up to the end of October. In
that month the going proved better
than ever. Trading volume soared to
an average daily level 184 percent
higher, and the value of shares traded
300 percent higher than the same
month last year. Most of November
was just as good, if not better, even
if activity has slackened since.
On some days this month total
volume has been nearer one million
shares a day, or about half the October
average. The difference is explained
more by a sharp drop of activity in
mining and oil shares than lighter
trading in industrials. Coming up to
Christmas, prices in all sections retreat-

SPECULATOR’S
DIARY
When the jingle
actually
means something
THE SPIRIT OF CHRISTMAS has
even reached the Exchange. Brokers
are reported to be playing Santa Claus
to their staffs in the grandest of grand
styles. Big fat bonuses are the order of
the day some of them even running
into four figures. In fact, this year’s
are believed to be the most generous
on record. And so they should. During
the past few months many of the toilers
in brokers’ offices have not only burned
the midnight oil but have missed out
on the weekend sun as well. Things
have been really rugged. When the
books are ruled off for 1967, the cur-
tain will have come down on one of
the most profitable and busiest years
ever enjoyed by the Australian Stock
Exchanges fraternity.
Just take Sydney as an example. In
January this year recorded monthly
turnover was $2l million, by June it
was almost double at $39 million, and
by November it was up to a mighty
$76 million. If you think that’s good,
just imagine the word the brokers use
for it. Calculating the brokerage on
total turnover for the 11 months to
November and dividing it by the num-
ber of individual brokers (not indi-
vidual firms, mind you), a figure of
$120,000 is reached. This is the average
amount that can be attributed to each
and every single broker. Adding in an
amount for December, comparable to
that of November, the figure zooms to
over $140,000. Admittedly, expenses of
operations have to come out of this,
but even so it leaves a very livable
income. Not at all bad for buying and
selling shares for someone else. Also
this does not include profits made from
trading, underwriting, and the one
hundred and one other little perks that
brokers get up to. So, all in all, when
the brokers sing Jingle Bells at their
parties, the “jingle” part will be really
relevant.
Not being a broker, I guess I had
better get back to the tougher (or at
least I think so, anyway) task of
speculating. A company that I hope
will make me a few bucks is A. G.
Healing. It is not that I think the
company is really up to much, but
that it is such a juicy takeover proposi-
tion. It’s just perfect for a break-up
type of proposition. Among its other
claims to fame it is one of the largest
medium-heavy engineering organisa-
tions in Australia, the largest steel
founder, one of the largest manufac-
turers and distributors of major
domestic appliances, and one of the
largest distributors of automotive
parts. If something can’t be done with
a set-up like that, the local merchant
bankers should give up. To top all this
off, the company has now suffered two
years of losses, which would be just
great for the tax bill. With a net
tangible asset backing 91 cents per
share and a market price of 17 cents,
the stock looks good picking. I picked
up 1000.
Incidentally, did you notice that
devaluation claimed one of the port-
folio stocks as its victim? The sufferer
was Ralta Holdings. Its shares dropped
as low as 40 cents, 10 cents lower than
its recent float-off price, soon after the
announcement. ITey have since
recovered to 45 cents, but are still well
below their peak of 65 cents, reached
earlier in the year. At today’s prices
they look cheap. Here’s why. In
1966/67 the company earned $176,000,
which was $13,000 better than 1966.
Probably about one-half of this profit
can be attributed to New Zealand
operations. In fact, it was probably less
because of the expansion of Australian
operations during the year from funds
raised by the public float.
Taking this into account, let’s look
at what could happen in 1967/68.
Allowing for stable profits and a drop
of around $15,000 from the Kiwi
operations, the company will still be
earning pretty much the same as it
did when floated off at par (when the
shares were selling for around 60
cents). And this estimate is an
extremely conservative one. It does not
allow for the company’s expansion in
Australia, into other products such as
frypans and hairdryers. Also it doesn’t
allow for the large increase in demand
expected for electric blankets in the
coming winter. It is rumored that the
company’s production in this area will
be up by around half in the current
year. So, all in all, with a yield of
nearly 9 percent, and a prospect of a
good year ahead, Ralta looks more
than warm, it looks hot.

Security analysis
Grace Bros.: a good investment
for the long term
AT THIS TIME of the year one might
be tempted to think about department
stores and, therefore, to consider their
shares as a form of investment. There
is no doubt that, from looking at the
Commonwealth statistics, retail sales
take a very marked upward lift in the
period from October through to
December. Of course, this is a situa-
tion which exists not only for Australia
as a whole but for each Australian
State, and when considering retail
stores one should take into considera-
tion the areas in which they operate.
Grace Bros. Holdings Ltd. operates
only in New South Wales so far as its
‘department-store activity is concerned,
although its removalist activities now
extend to all States in Australia. The
history of Grace Bros, goes back as far
as 1885, when a tiny drapery shop was
opened at 203 George Street. In 1930
an 11-storey building was erected on
the frontages of York, King, and
Clarence Streets, in Sydney, but in 1945
this building was resumed by the
Federal Government. Sites were
acquired at Parramatta and Bondi in
1933 and stores were operated on these
sites from that date. However, the
fact that Grace Bros, no longer had
a major stoxe in the Sydney retail area
could have looked a disastrous situation
in the early ’fifties, and the company
took the courageous decision of build-
ing major department stores on its two
sites at Parramatta and Bondi, which
were completed in 1957. Another
major department store was completed
at Chatswood in 1961, and Roselands,
the latest addition to the Grace Bros,
chain, was opened in October, 1965.
There is little doubt that this planned
expansion in the Sydney suburbs has
been a major success so far as Grace
Bros, is concerned. Even the Rose-
lands development, which shortly after
it was opened had to face competition
from two new centres at Bankstown and
Burwood, which are not very far distant
from Roselands, has continued to
prosper. In the chairman’s address of
1967, it is stated: “We are frequently
asked: ‘How is Broadway trading com-
pared with the downtown city area?’
I can only say that Broadway is both
profitable and maintaining a rate of
sales increase above that published for
the City of Sydney inner area.”
While the company does not seem
to have any plans for completely new
stores at the present time, it is propos-
ing to make substantial improvements
to the Broadway store during 1967/8
and it has already added a larger car
park at the Bondi store. In common
with the other Sydney-based depart-
ment stores, Grace Bros, does not
publish sales figures, but if one assumes
that the margin obtained from retail
sales has not changed greatly over the
past five years, the following figures
could give an indication of the possible
trend in sales value over this period.
The figures are derived from the net
trading profit before tax, interest, de-
preciation and various other provisions.
They are shown in index form:
Year to July 31 1963 1964 1965 1966 1967
100 130 160 208 228
These figures suggest that sales have
been increasing at nearly 23 percent
per annum compound over the past
five years, which is greatly in excess
of the increase in retail sales in New
South Wales as shown by the Com-
monwealth Statistician’s statistics.
The removals division, which is re-
ceiving considerable attention at the
present time, has now expanded so that
it has 27 repositories throughout Aus-
tralia and a fleet of over 350 vehicles.
The percentage contribution to profit
by this division has not been disclosed,
but is probably of the order of 15-20
percent of group profit.
Recently, the company has estab-
lished travel agencies and, over the
past two years, has been studying the
results. It now seems likely that these
agencies will be merged into a division
and there is every reason to believe
that this new venture will also prosper
under the Grace Bros, baimer.
The statistics over the past five
years have been as follows:

The problem at this stage is to de-
cide what is likely to happen in the
future, on the assumption that Grace
Bros, will not achieve any increases in
selling-floor area for the next year or
so. In this connection it must be noted
that in the past new stores have only
been erected after considerable plan-
ning. For example, in the prospectus
of the share issue which made Grace
Bros, a public company with its shares
listed on the Exchange, it was stated:
“Further development was planned in
1952 to acquire a suitable department
store site in Chatswood, and this has
now been accomplished.” This pros-
pectus was dated October 14, 1960,
and the Chatswood store opened in
1961. Unless the board has already
planned another centre, it is unlikely
that we shall see a new store for
several years to come. Further in-
creases in sales must, therefore, arise
from Grace Bros, continuing to increase
its existing share of the market by
achieving greater sales within the
same selling space.
It must be pointed out that, in the
five-year period which we are con-
sidering, the only addition of any size
made to the retail-selling-floor area
was Roselands, which would appear
to have added about 15 percent to the
total area owned by Grace Bros. As
has already been pointed out, sales
probably more than doubled over this
period and the rate of increase on an
annual basis was about 23 percent.
While this rate of growth cannot con-
tinue indefinitely, there is every rea-
son to believe that similar increases
could be achieved at least in 1967/8
and possibly up to, say, 1970.
The main problem is the increase
in costs of labor in particular, over
this period, and after having to face
up to quite a substantial increase in
1965/6 another increase to the total
wage was made in July last, which
will probably increase wages again so
far as the department stores .generally
are concerned during the 1967/8 year.
On the other hand, retail sales are
currently very buoyant, and there is
no reason to believe that this situation
will change during the 1967/8 year.
At current prices around $2.30 the
shares are selling at 16.8 times
1966/7 adjusted earnings, and the
dividend yield is a mere 2.9 percent.
There is every prospect that earnings
could increase to about 14J cents pet-
share in 1967/8, which indicates a
price/earnings ratio of about 16 times.
It is worth noting that over the past
five years the average price/earnings
ratio has only been below this during
the 1966 calendar year, when it fell
as low as 13. In the early years the
price/earnings ratio was in excess of
20.
While it is difficult to foresee any
substantial improvement in the price
in the short term,, there is every reason
to believe that people buying Grace
Bros.’ shares today will be making
a good investment for the long term.

Mining
Capital for Broken Hill South?
FOR THE FIRST TIME in many
years Broken Hill South’s cash position
has shown a decline and indications
are that the company will be seeking
the introduction of new capital either
by way of equity or loan. There have
been heavy demands on the company’s
funds during the past twelve months.
The high royalties incurred on profits
in 1966 have had to be met at a time
when lead and zinc prices are lower.
The company also has commitments
for expenditure of $BOO,OOO on its
plants, and growing expenditure on
exploration, not only in respect of its
phosphate discoveries but on other
prospects as well. And should the com-
pany meet with any success in these
other prospects, further funds would
be required.
These factors led the chairman of
the company to point out that the
liquidity of the group has declined
and, although the company intends to
continue with short-term borrowing
and bank overdraft as sources of
finance, directors are reviewing the
longer-term position in the light of
possible demands for funds in the
future.
During the year to June last, Bro-
ken Hill South spent just under $1
million on exploration under agree-
ments with outside organisations, on
drilling its own phosphate deposits in
Queensland, and on field exploration
on its own account. The company has
one of the widest spreads of explora-
tion interests in Australia,
All in all, the company’s resources
seem rather fully committed and should
it be successful in proving up any
other major mineral deposits, such as
the phosphate at Duchess, this would
only mean an increase in its appetite
for developmental capital. To assist in
financing development of the Cobar
mine, the company some years ago
liquidated some of the investments it
held. It still retains listed shares having
a value of some $8.4 million, but a
glance at these suggests that the com-
pany is unlikely to consider selling
them. They include 1.5 million Asso-
ciated Pulp and Paper Mills Limited,
1.7 million EZ Industries Limited,
71,000 North Broken Hill Limited, and
48,000 Western Mining Corporation
Limited. In 1961 the company made a
l-for-2 issue at 75 cents per share in
order to help finance its participation
in Alcoa of Australia Pty. Limited, as
well as development at Cobar, and this
issue raised $6 million. (It was on a
l-for-2 basis as at October 30, 1961,
with payments spread over 2\ years.)
The company should have no difficul-
ties in raising a similar sum at the
present time.
WHILE INTEREST IN Great Boulder
has diminished for the moment, it is
easier to look at Loloma Mining Cor-
poration’s prospects as a miner itself.
It ceased gold mining in Fiji in 1960,
and after living off the income from
its investments for some time, it began
investigating tin deposits in North
Queensland, and in 1965 it began open-
cast mining to feed a mobile plant at
Stannary Hills, out of Herberton, but
this operation ceased in January this
year. While proceeds of the sale of
production almost covered actual min-
ing expenditure, the amortisation of
mining plant and apportionment of
overheads meant a loss of $104,000,
due to the fact that the actual
recovered grade was lower than that
indicated by the sampling program.
The plant is of a type designed for
disassembly, and re-erection on a new
site has provided the company with
valuable experience in the operation of
the treatment of small deposits.
So far the company’s leases have not
produced a deposit suitable for the
same plant, but there has been a very
promising area found between Ingham
and Townsville which is suitable for
dredging. These leases, the company
says, show with reasonable certainty
the existence of between 15 and 20 mil-
lion cubic yards of alluvial gravels con-
taining on the average about 9oz. of
cassiterite per cubic yard. This seems
quite a reasonable grade, and the size
of the deposit would be large enough
to support a dredging operation with
an annual throughput of, say, two mil-
lion cubic yards, that is, about the same
rate as Ravenshoe Tin. Before it starts
mining this area, the company will no
doubt subject it to more stringent
sampling than occurred at Stannary
Hills. Certainly the market has placed
little value on the company’s chances
as a tin miner the current price of
$3.20 is fully accounted for by about
$1.75 per share worth of investments
and $1.48 per share for the company’s
interest in Loloma. This may well be
too harsh an assessment.

SHARE YIELDS AND STATISTICS
Reacting both to Mr. McEwen’s utterance on devaluation
and the wages decisions, many shares among all sections have
bumped downwards; the drift, still on relatively small volumes,
is most obvious among second-line stocks. Yet BHP, too, lost
a net 40 cents, finishing at $l5 after once reaching $14.40.
Other leaders to retreat included CSR $4.45 (down 25 cents),
ACI $3.10 (3 cents), and Henry Jones $2.56 (14 cents).
William Adams shed 30 cents to touch $1.70. Miners were
not aloof; some of the falls embraced Western Mining (down
50 cents), Great Boulder (10 cents), and CRA (80 cents).

THE LAND
Agrisearch
Triumphs in food production
OVER ITS SHOULDER sententious
humanity sees the spectre of starvation
coming quickly closer. It is true that
a protein famine already stalks widely
over the world and that many areas
experience recurring shortages of
calories as well. Within twenty years
the terrible grind will be on nearly
everywhere. Thus say the demog-
raphers and economists the counters
of mouths and bushel baskets. The
agricultural scientists are not quite so
glum. They point out that the bio-
logical limits in productivity have not
yet been achieved with a single com-
modity anywhere in the world. Great
increases, they say, are theoretically
possible; with ingenuity on the one
hand and diligent application on the
other, heartening results can be
achieved.
They instance the inspiring example
of Mexico. Over the past twenty years
that country’s population has increased
70 percent, but production of each of
its three main items of food—wheat,
maize (corn), and beans has in-
creased 300 percent. This magnificent
achievement has been wrought by a
combine of scientists and teachers sent
in by the Rockefeller Foundation of
New York. Plant-breeders and agron-
omists found out how to increase and
stabilise yields and the extension officers
showed the peasants how to apply the
new techniques. Some land reforms put
the cap on this revolutionary move-
ment.
Another equally impressive example,
though less well known as yet, is the
new rice, IRB-288-3, released by the
International Rice Research Institute
in the Philippines about two years ago.
This variety outyields the various
indigenous strains throughout South-
East Asia by three- to four-fold. In
addition, it matures more quickly,
allowing three crops a year to be har-
vested in suitable areas. It has been
estimated that India could close her
food-grain gap if on just 15 percent
of her rice lands she could nearly
double average yields. This new rice,
known as Miracle in the Philippines,
promises to do at least this for India.
The Philippines itself is rapidly con-
verting from a net importer to an
exporter of rice as Miracle is planted
in more and more paddy fields. Ware-
houses in the Philippines remain con-
gested with the last shipments of rice
that arrived just as the first harvests
of unprecedented plenty were being
gathered. The huge yields have had a
snowball effe.ct: they have been so
dramatically great that the tradition-
tied Asian rice-grower has accepted the
new variety immediately, and the
margin of profit has been such that
he can now afford to buy fertilisers,
pesticides, implements, the lot.
Perhaps the most encouraging aspect
of all is that both of these tremendous
successes sprang from relatively small
financial support. Up till 1963, the
Rockefeller Foundation’s annual expen-
diture in Mexico had not exceeded half
a million dollars. The International
Rice Research Institute’s budget was
only about $1.4 million last year.
Australia seems poised to begin con-
tributing on a comparable scale to the
world’s protein supply, which is the
part of the diet that is already
stretched to its critical limits. Beef pro-
duction is likely to soar here during
the next two decades. Although this
particular form of protein is beyond
most pockets, an increased supply of
red meat may enable certain shifts to
be made in the form of protein pro-
duction elsewhere. Consequently, more
of the cheaper types of protein might
eventually be diverted to the poorer
parts of the world or grown locally.
Mr. J. Walker, a livestock research
scientist with the Victorian Department
of Agriculture, told a meeting of cattle-
men at Portland that if all of them
were to adopt improved production
methods, such as are already practised
by a few, a thousand pounds of beef
(liveweight) per acre per year would
be standard performance by 1975. This
represents a two- to three-fold increase
over the current average. Also by that
date, or by 1980 at the latest, Victoria
alone should be supporting a beef-cattle
herd of three million head. From his
vantage point at Katherine, in the
Northern Territory, Dr. M. J. Norman,
CSIRO, foresees a minimum of 12
million head spread over the continent
north of the Tropic of Capricorn.
Numbers will build up as Townsville
lucerne becomes established on ever-
widening areas. According to Dr.
Norman, the day is coming fast in the
desolate north when the throttle on
production will be the reproductive
capacity of the beef cow rather than
the feed supply. Grazing trials con-
ducted near Katherine have shown that
by means of Townsville lucerne a fat
steer can be turned off in six acre-
years, instead of in 100-120 acre-years
as at present, relying on the native
pasture.
And this is no flash in the pan. Over
in the northern brigalow country in
Queensland both the CSIRO and the
Department of Primary Industries have
recently announced that trial cattle on
sown-grass pastures of green panic and
sorghum almum have made annual
weight gains fully comparable with
those obtained on the lush, long-estab-
lished pastures of southern Australia. In
the CSIRO experiment the cattle were
ready for market at about 30 months
of age after putting on almost 4001 b.
liveweight during the last year. The
Department’s trial was carried out
under tougher conditions, but their
cattle also did remarkably well and
were marketed weighing only a little
less at about the same age. Supple-
mentary rations were not provided in
either trial.
Previously, the idea of getting two-
year-old cattle to market from the
Fitzroy Basin without the aid of special
feeding was unthinkable. Another im-
portant point to note about these trials:
neither of the pastures contained
legumes. Suitable legumes are now
available for the area, and when these
become incorporated in the pasture, the
above figures, impressive though they
are at the moment, will be made to
appear paltry. It now seems certain
that the brigalow country can be made
to produce several times more beef than
anyone had believed possible. Beef-
production research in Australia has
another thing in common with the
Mexican and Filipino stories: only a
minor fragment of the research moneys
available has been committed to it.

GETTING MARRIED
THE INDEPENDENT THEATRE, SYDNEY, after 38 years
of life with status unresolved, has now taken its courage, and
a modest $BOOO grant from the N.S.W. Government, in its
hands and become a professional repertory theatre. Shaw’s
“Getting Married,” produced by Rhoderick Walker, is one
of the first sequence of three plays, which are receiving both
critical acclaim and popular support. The theatre is also
playing T. S. Eliot’s “The Cocktail Party” and Charles Dyer’s
“Staircase.” “Halloran’s Little Beat” by Thomas Keneally was
added to the repertory on December 19.
The Bishop of Chelsea (Brian James) and his wife (Aileen
Britton) are pleased when their daughter, Edith (Patricia
Leehy), and Cecil Sykes (Ross Thompson), after much
Shavian conversation, decide to marry
Mrs. George (Doreen Warburton) brings her enthusi-
astic meddling to bear on the marriage problems of
Leo Bridgenorth (Carmen Duncan) and her husband,
Reginald (Alexander Hay)
Above, St. John Hotchkiss’ (Donald Macdonald) upper-
class ardors are dampened by Mrs. George’s (Doreen
Warburton) lower-class vigor. Below, Lesbia Grantham
(Jacqueline Kott) and General Bridgenorth (James
Condon) forever talking about marriage without reaching
any conclusion
Below, Mrs. Bridgenorth (Aileen Britton) and the local green-
grocer, Mr. Collins (Gordon Glenwright), hopefully prepare
the wedding cake in case someone stops talking long enough to
get married


ARTS AND ENTERTAINMENT
Art, 1967
Overwhelmed from abroad
By ELWYN LYNN
NINETEEN SIXTY-SEVEN was a
year when the most formidable of
one-man shows could hardly be as
memorable as those from abroad;
Aspects of New British Art, Two
Decades of American Painting, Rodin
and His Contemporaries, Primitive
African Negro Art, London’s Marl-
borough artists and, at the year’s end,
26 Toulouse-Lautrec lithographs at
Melbourne’s Tolarno.
One-man shows significantly re-
affirmed the reputation of Fred Wil-
liams, the late Ralph Balson, Louis
James, Charles Blackman, Arthur Boyd,
Judy Cassab, and Stan Rapotec, intro-
duced Dale Hickey and Peter Dickie
(the former a tough expressionist, the
latter a tougher abstract painter), and
revealed in Robert Jacks, Alun Leach-
Jones, and • David Aspden a lyrical
geometry and in Dick Watkins, a
classical, formal clarify. In fact, the
color-field abstractionists split generally
into the smoothly resilient and the
toughly analytic. Some looked back to
the ’twenties for kicks (realists seem
to look back only for solace and con-
firmation) from Art Nouveau, Magritte
and Arp, though there was no sign of
Arp’s random placement. Anguish,
corrosive color, convulsive rhythms, and
the disintegration of planes hardly
showed in abstractionist or realist as
though “The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari”
was replaced by “The Umbrellas of
Cherbourg,” and Kafka’s “Castle” by
Capote’s “In Cold Blood.”
Sydney no longer seemed to have
a monopoly of charm allied to vitalism:
Melbourne and Adelaide produced
similar artists, but Funk emerged in
more than one city to upset the
joyously colored geometry, with Max
Lyle, lan Van Wieringen, Unsworth,
and Vivienne Binns, the last, with
Garry Shead, demonstrating that
eroticism is not so enticing as it’s
imagined. Repulsive was what a
magistrate in 1966 thought of Michael
Brown’s paintings, but in 1967 Judge
Levine, declaring some works obscene,
reduced the three months’ jail to a $2O
fine. In Melbourne a magistrate had
found Ron Upton not guilty of
obscenity, but added some qualifica-
tions about the audience: all in all, a
pleasant blend of permissiveness,
sophistication, and responsibility for
morality.
Tapestries by Olsen, Arthur Boyd,
and Coburn, with Aubusson commis-
sions going to Plate and Schlicht de-
molished the 1950 s notion that art was
not reproducable and that the spirit
of the aesthetic thing-in-itself perishes
by modification.
In sculpture, which explored new
areas of experience more than painting,
implacable toughness survived in Oliffe
Richmond’s beleaguered men, in
Donald Brook’s battered austerity and
in others (Elwyn Dennis, Dunn’s
metal structures) at the Alcorso-Sekers
show, where, as at Mildura’s fine tri-
ennial, there were also the clean purists.
Significant purists were Wendy Para-
mour, Mick Kitching, and Jordan, in his
ultra-violet-lit pyramids. Most memor-
Above and at right, two of the Tou-
louse-Lautrec lithographs in the collec-
tion of 26 which the Tolarno Galleries,
Melbourne, imported
able of the local sculpture shows were
by Kitching, Brook, Jomantis, and Rich-
mond, the last showing his kinship with
the splendid and immensely popular
touring show, Rodin and His Contem-
poraries.
Commercial galleries that felt real
kinship only with the Nolan Retrospec-
tive flourished with Clune’s in a with-
it environment looking over the past
with a colonial eye, and Bonython pro-
viding the only browsing gallery,
except, perhaps, for Rose Skinner’s, of
Perth, in Australia. Bonython brought
examples from the Marlborough of
London, a gallery that promotes
ancienne avant garde. In London in
the past few months galleries have
closed: Signals with mainly kinetic
art, Indica and Mcßoberts and Tun-
nard, both with a lot of hard-edge, and
the Hamilton with a more varied
policy. In Sydney it’s ideology rather
than profit that sustains the Central
Gallery; a new approach sustains our
first art-consultant, Joseph Brown, of
Collins Street, where he assembles
examples of the recently canonised, and
Mrs. Thelma Clune, our first agent,,
exclusively representing Robert Klippel.
Some critics are on the move: one
in Sydney was barred from a gallery;
one in Melbourne was ejected. Dr.
Donald Brook is to come to the
“Sydney Morning Herald” and G. R.
Lansell writes for the “Sunday Tele-
graph” where he’s introduced a four-
to-one star system. You get one star
even if “abysmal”—like a Purple Heart
for being shot while running away.
There are now ten critics with univer-
sity degrees at large in Australia and
Max Hutchison of the pleasantly re-
furbished Gallery A mutters about the
academics taking over.
It was the emphasis on academic
training in Professor Bernard Smith’s
new Power courses that aroused con-
troversy of a kind; certainly the allo-
cation of one year, beginning in 1880,
to contemporary art, stirred in his
critics memories of his polemical and
retardataire Antipodean Manifesto of
1959. (It’s still around and is quoted
in Boas’ introduction to Phillip’s new
book on Arthur Boyd as though it was
gospel rather than perverse and special
pleading.) Most of Smith’s critics were


misinformed about the Power Bequest
and the University’s intentions, but
Smith did publicly praise our cultural
connections with France as he opened
the Rodin show with the mighty
Americans next door and did condemn
Sydney critics as PR men for the
American show statements hardly
calculated to allay the doubts of those
who thought (mistakenly) that the
practising artist had been cheated out
of his inheritance by Smith and the
University.
Actually the U.S. show, awaited by
many for a decade, did not go uncriti-
cised even in Sydney: John Henshaw
and Laurie Thomas (he just didn’t like
the black Reinhardts) had doubts, and
in Melbourne Ron Millar questioned
the enormous sizes, while Alan McCul-
loch saw in some works the suicide of
art certainly in Reinhardt’s. Rein-
hardt, in whom theory and practice
operated as in no other modern, oblig-
ingly died a few months later.
Predictions about the. evil effects of
the U.S. show and the British exhi-
bition (the latter looked less intense and
quite amateurish when compared with
the American, with notable exceptions
like Harold Cohen, Brian Wall, Allen
Jones, and Bridget Riley) seemed con-
firmed with the Young Contemporaries,
CAS and the Alcorso-Sekers show,
but most exhibitors who resembled
American or London artists had been
following international modes for some
time and were familiar with U.S. and
U.K. art before they sa\y the actual
paintings.
Waldo Rasmussen, who accompanied
the U.S. show, thinks we should look
for effects in two or three years’ time:
the effects may be quicker, but if ABC-
TV had allowed its “Spectrum” inter-
view with Patrick Heron to be tele-
vised he argued that an indigenous
quality merges with international modes
we might have been spared Laurie
Thomas’ condemnation of CAS and
Alcorso-Sekers exhibitors as plagiarists
and thieves both in the “Australian”
and 6n ABC-TV’s “Survey.” The
notion of Australianism as an aesthetic
criterion was raised once again, and
the Outback, in a country where about
half the population has lived in cities
since 1830, was summoned up to com-
bat internationalism. What public dis-
cussion ensued was brief and devastat-
ing for Mr. Thomas’ notions.
Strangely enough, Nolan, whose
Retrospective stunned another kind of
Doubting Thomas, wasn’t lauded as the
answer to the internationalists; as
Nolan said himself, his art was open-
ended and non-didactic. For the young
Nolan’s lesson was a moral one: per-
sistence and self-criticism in developing
one’s imagery.
What else? A Texture Survey at
Stern’s, Blackman’s Alice Paintings at
South Yarra Gallery, The Australian
Nude (she looked international but the
bush was dinkum), good surveys at
Newcastle, the CAS in Sydney, and
at the George’s Prize in Melbourne.
In a year full of changes, of follow-
ing fashions and slavish imitations, it
was heartening to see on the back of
a painting by a Spanish artist living in
Australia: “Autentico de mi mano y
registrado en mi archivo There’s sin-
cerity.
Nineteen sixty-eight might already
seem like an anti-climax, but Marcel
Duchamp is at hand, and in May
Clement Greenberg, who believes that
art’s destiny is to discard literary and
representational impedimenta, will be
here to lecture. Chauvinists should offer
him a hot pie and go easy on the
Strine bit.
Television, 1967
Expecting too much
By FRANK ROBERTS
FROM ONE VIEWPOINT, television
has had a regressive year; one which
began without new American shows
(there was a quarrel over prices), gave
us months of repeats, which proved
that good shows are worth repeating
but poor ones repeated are merely
double disasters, and ended with
threats of official censorship aimed, I
imagine, at the naughty episode which
brought the ABC’s “Playhouse” season
from a zero beginning to a mildly
lively end.
Another possible viewpoint is that
being expressed by viewers-at-large
(“nothing to watch on TV these days”)
and occasionally by professional critics
who do not seem to be thinking very
deeply. It is a critic’s job to press for
improvement of his medium, but surely
he needs a sense of proportion as much
as the wowsers do. And while carping
legitimately in television’s best interests,
he should suggest alternatives, which
might easily leave him in the unten-
able position of saying, “no more
American shows, they’re all predictable,
repetitious formulas, let’s have only
Australian shows instead.” This would
be as silly as crying “Shame!” when
television shows anything gently risque.
After watching television for a
decade, the more rational viewers no
longer expect endless benefits from it.
It cannot satisfy everyone’s, tastes con-
stantly, any more than three or four
neighborhood picture theatres could. It
will, if viewers use it selectively, deliver
more entertainment and information
mingled than any other single medium.
It is a wonder but not a cornucopia.
The major problem of selective
viewing, how to know when a poorly
described program item will be worth
watching or not, points to a need for
more reliable guidance from the maga-
zine and newspaper guides and the
critics. Sensibly, perhaps, both func-
tions should be combined, an idea
unlikely to appeal immediately to
channels with print connections, but
also one likely to prevent the gradual
viewer-drift from TV, by pin-pointing
the really good programs which can
easily be missed by families who switch
off at 9 or 10 p.m. when the usual
scant program notes suggest nothing
remarkable during the next half-hour.
There are millions of viewers and per-
haps the entire lack of this service may
be a failure to do right by the public.
Nationally, or to be exact, part so,
the ABC’s “This Day Tonight” was the
new advance for the year, -the television
show of which parts are most likely to
be remembered. While still seeming a
little aimless in time-subject allotment,
its producers continue to achieve
marvels in scope and ingenuity (at un-
revealed cost). “Four Corners” was, as
usual, staid and informative. Of other
channels’ public affairs programs,
“Project ’67” kept a high standard,
with legitimate use of international
material, while “Seven Days,” missing
Peter Westerway, often fails by using
too much local makeshift and too little
international. I wonder why local
sound tracks are not dubbed on to
European camera documentation.
Television’s “legitimate” drama was
provided almost entirely by British
sources through the ABC. For a second
year the “Playhouse” series hardly
approached those heights. The Ameri-
can series—well, those intended to be
simply “funnies”—were much better
this year, and on all channels. Most
were spoofs of other supposedly
dramatic series, which must have an
eventual contra-effect on those, prob-
ably for the good of American tele-
vision and, eventually, ours.
The disappointment of the year was
“Mavis.” The show tried it without
a “star” and fell down badly, not be-
cause the local talent was useless but
simply because Creyton disappeared
and Fraser’s role was not changed and
elevated. I doubt that even Galton
and Simpson could have saved the
remaining crew.
Music
"Messiah" as it
was written
By PAUL FROLICH
AS SEASONS come and go, it some-
times seems as if the only immutable
thing in our musical life is the annual
performance of “Messiah” and its
audience of devotees. In recent years,
there have been some healthy signs of
a reformation: students of 18th-century
music, including a few conductors and
choirmasters, went to much trouble
to discover the methods of performance
used in Handel’s own day and they
sloughed off a thick layer of Victorian
accretions. We have heard some of
their startling results once or twice
and some of us hope for more.
This year, the ABC announced

that the “Messiah” was to be performed
“. . . on a scale Handel would have
known, and as near as possible as can
be ascertained to the first Dublin per-
formance. The choir and orchestra used
are smaller than is usual, and the
arias and recitatives will be sung as
originally written.”
In the event, the ABC’s promise
was at least partly kept. The orchestra
was indeed stripped to essentials, the
centrally placed harpsichord was fully
audible, the Town Hall’s monster or-
gan supplanted by the ABC’s fine
chamber organ. For most else, the
promise had outstripped the happening.
The choir, some 80 voices strong, was
surely larger than that of 1742, and
while the music was nominally “sung
as originally written” this did not, I
regret, mean singing in genuine
18th r century style. The only wel-
come exception was soprano Marilyn
Richardson, who has specifically
schooled herself to an understanding
of the Italianate embellishments current
in Handel’s time. Florence Taylor,
though she tried for style, has too
often sung the bowdlerised versions
beloved of our audiences and cannot
now make so complete a change. Tenor
Raymond McDonald did not even try
very hard and baritone John Cameron,
on one of his rare visits to his home-
land, might have been performing in
any one of the grand Italian operas
of the 19th century.
Lest I be thought to be niggling,
let me say that there was a great deal
to enjoy in the performance, much
that I appreciated. Best of all was the
overall direction by Tibor Paul, whose
return to Australia is indeed to be
welcomed. In six years abroad, mostly
in Dublin, Mr. Paul’s conducting has
gained in breadth and precision, with
not a single superfluous movement.
The small orchestra, with the strings
reduced to about 24, played ex-
ceedingly well, and the players seemed
to be in little doubt about the kind
of sound to be produced. The one
exception was John Robertson, whose
trumpet solo was neither accurate nor
stylish, even though he seemed to
play better than has been usual. The
Hurlstone Choir, numbers apart, was
very good indeed and its sections
reached an admirable degree of- bal-
ance, with the altos still the best-
sounding group.
Next to Tibor Paul, the laurels for
the performance were undoubtedly
Miss Richardson’s. With her sweet and
pure voice, with deceptive simplicity,
she created the evening’s greatest
moments: “There were shepherds abid-
ing,” “Rejoice greatly,” “How beauti-
ful are the feet,” “I know that my
Redeemer liveth,” and “If God be with
us,” each of these challenges was met
with musicianly conviction; but it was
in some of the rarely heard recitatives,
in quite unexpected places, that
Marilyn Richardson found her greatest
glory. The audience, alas, seemed sure
of one thing only: that, thunderously,
they must rise to their feet for the
“Hallelujah” chorus!
Films
Succeeding against
the rules
By BEVERLEY TIVEY
A Funny Thing Happened On The
Way To The Forum. Director,
Richard Lester.
The Naked Runner. Director, Sidney
J. Furie.
ON THE STAGE, “A Funny Thing
Happened, etc.” was a simple, un-
complicated production made up of
good old vaudeville jokes and routines,
with no attempt at spectacle or lavish
staging. How will this blend with
Richard Lester’s elaborate, gimmicky
style of film-making? Against all the
rules, it somehow adds up to one of
the most cheerfully entertaining movies
I’ve seen for a long time.
The plot, set in ancient Rome, defies
analysis, being filled with disguises,
mistaken identity, doubles entendres,
and wonderfully anachronistic jokes
“Was One a good year?” inquires a
character, examining a bottle of wine.
There are a few songs, a “sit-down
orgy for 40,” a wild chase in chariots.
Hang stylistic unity! The whole thing
is enormous fun, which is exactly what
it set out to be.
Lester has a great eye for a sight
gag, and the movie is constantly sur-
prising and amusing to watch; it’s very
prettily photographed, too, though
visual beauty is always secondary to
knockabout humor. Needless to say,
Lester plays about with jump-cutting,
slowed or frozen shots and soft focus,
but only very occasionally lets this
indulgence get out of hand; and though
realism is the furthest thing from his
mind I suspect that his dirty, cramped,
cluttered Roman streets are much
nearer the real thing than most big,
historical spectacles.
Zero Mostel, Phil Silvers, and Jack
Gilford play their roles as straight
burlesque; Michael Hordern has a
seedy elegance that is uncommonly
amusing. Michael Crawford is quite
endearing as the gawky young lover,
and Buster Keaton, in his last appear-
ance before his death, leaves a delight-
ful memorial to his comic genius.
The plot of “The Naked Runner”
is complex, certainly, but I really don’t
think Sidney Furie had to assume
such a complete lack of comprehension
on the part of his audience. By the
time he’s explained several times, very
slowly and carefully, what’s going on,
we’ve pretty well ceased to care. A
pity, because a good thriller could have
been made of this story of an innocent
man unwittingly cheated by British
Intelligence into becoming a murderer.
Their reasons for this roundabout pro-
cedure struck me as inadequate, but
I’d have accepted this if the film had
been made with more verve and
excitement.


BOOKS
Tynan: a noble battler with a
glossy, surface talent
By CHARLES HIGHAM
Tynan Right and Left. Kenneth Tynan.
Longmans. $6.15.
Private Screenings. John Simon. Mac-
millan, New York. $6.95.
IF ONE WERE ASKED to sum up in
a word the essence of Tynan’s style,
it would be: theatricality. He is a per-
former, a willing victim of a trans-
atlantic cultural situation which calls
upon the critic to show off. He does
show off continually, in a style that,
■wayward, fanciful, and lavish, is never
discreet or reserved. One hears the
voice clearly as though across Sardi’s,
bright with puns and similes, altern-
ately waspish or ecstatic, rich in lit-
erary allusions, Marxist in inspiration
but lushly near-Sitwellian in rhodomon-
tade. He calls sternly for realism in the
theatre; he has been, vociferously, the
spokesman of the New Left; but his
tone is aristocratic and Edwardian,
preserving the grand style of the pre-
-1914 twilight.
Tynan has himself confessed the
cause: James Agate. This animated
toby jug, this tweedy Mancunian whose
prose style remains the most execrably
gross in the recent history of dramatic
criticism, was the first to discover
Tynan—at school. They corresponded
and the Master’s influence was fell, as
Mr. Tynan has admitted. Agate came
to Tynan’s school at Birmingham and
lectured, “barking about the lethargy
of trains and extending to me a soft
hand that smelled as though it were
washed four times a day.”
Encouraged by Agate, Tynan came
to London, following in his provincial
leader’s footsteps. Since then, the stages
of his career have gone like the acts
of a play: Act One, writing a letter to
the “Evening Standard” criticising the
then resident critic, Beverley Baxter,
rivalling Baxter, and then replacing him
in the paper’s columns, moving on to
the “Spectator” and the “Observer”;
Act Two, becoming a transatlantic
figure, writing for “Holiday” and the
“New Yorker” and “Harper’s Bazaar,”
the style becoming increasingly smart
and brittle: Act Three, taking up the
post of Literary Director of the
National Theatre and tussling spectacu-
larly with Truman Capote over “In
Cold Blood.”
Along the way, he had appeared in
notable scenes: marching to Aldermas-
ton, standing in deep mourning over
the National Theatre’s foundation stone
when it looked as though it would never
be built, appearing before a Washington
investigation into his politics, uttering
That Word on British television. Pie
has lived his life in the glare of the
spotlight, and he is as bright as a
spotlight’s blaze, expertly describing
performances in a glittering phrase, re-
creating for a middle-class, middle-
brow audience the feeling of being at a
play, but never analysing deeply, never
really shown at full stretch in a
sustained essay.
Perhaps the most curious event in
Tynan’s career was the publication by
the “Observer,” in 1961, of a review
of his book, “Curtains,” by Mary
McCarthy. It was a cold but fair
review, correctly defining Tynan’s style
as visual rather than analytical, while
at the same time doing some justice to
his gifts. The “Observer” printed under-
neath it a riposte by Alan Pryce-Jones
(Mr. Tynan was then resident drama
critic) entitled with unforgivable vul-
garity, “Contrary Mary,” and trounc-
ing her for her act of folly: “The very
clever lady is a great one for analysis,
so let us consider what she is saying.”
A letter appeared in the “Observer”
the following week which put my own
views • in a nutshell: “Now that the
‘Observer’ has set the precedent, may
all writers who consider their book
unsympathetically reviewed employ
Kenneth Tynan . . . love of glamor
their own critic to defend it?” Simil-
arly, in the correspondence over “In
Cold Blood,” reprinted in this book,
Tynan is allowed the last word; but
neither he nor Truman Capote (whom
he charges with having failed to save
the lives of the murderers who were his
subjects) emerges with much credit
from a particularly shrill, hysterical,
and overheated exchange.
Tynan is, as I have said, a victim:
a victim of the demands of cultural
journalism. He must at all times dazzle,
and the serious business of getting to
the guts of a play must go by the board.
He is, as I recall from personal experi-
ence, a nice man and a charming host.
His enthusiasm and energy, his color
and dash and sense of joy in being
alive and in a theatre or cinema or
restaurant are intensely likable: he is
someone who is, for a change, entirely
pleased about living in the ’sixties. He
has a hedonistic panache that makes
most critics seem drab and academic.
He is anti-puritan, anti-Establish-
ment, and a noble battler against cen-
sorship, fuddy-duddy attitudes, and
dullness, and one honors him for all
this. But his talent is on the surface;
cut deep below this glittering top-
dressing and you come back with
nothing much more nourishing than
meringue pie.
The prose is at all times highly
charged: he talks of “chasms of desper-
ation,” of the “sunflower serenity” of
Vanessa Redgrave, of someone “look-
ing plangent,” of a man with “eyes as
sharp as a fly’s” (are a fly’s eyes
sharp?). He is sometimes careless, as
when he talks about Citizen Kane not
having a father, when Kane’s father
appears in a scene in Welles’ film that
Tynan himself finds memorable. His
essays on Welles and on Cukor are
mere superficial run-throughs, his travel
writings glossy flights of words. He is
prone to Technicolor superlatives, to
“superbs” and “greats,” to, in a word,
gush. His enthusiasms notably for
Godard and Sir Laurence Olivier
carry him far from criticism into the
world of advertising copy.
'The tragedy is (and I hope tragedy
is not too strong a word) that Tynan
had it in him to become a great critic,
a Shaw or a Desmond MacCarthy. But
his fatal love of glamor, his sheer ex-
citement at being a theatre critic, has
told against him. The very quality one
finds most endearing in him, his love of
theatre, has made him a fan. Even
when he attacks, it is with a brilliant
fan’s tap across a cheek, not, save
rarely, with a rapier’s thrust.
After ploughing through acres of
high-pitched prose, one is left at the
end of this book with a few things that


remain worth preserving: the factual
pieces, some moments of wit, well docu-
mented accounts of German theatre
and of film festivals abroad, a descrip-
tion of a meeting with Tennessee Wil-
liams and Hemingway. The fascination
there lies (and especially for us here)
in a vicarious experience of the nerve
centres of Western culture, even
though we see them through too-
dazzled eyes. It is a sad comment on
our period that we would rather read
about the famous than about their
works, that we find gossip more enter-
taining than the brightest critical
words. One likes Tynan best, in fact,
for reasons which can only reflect badly
on oneself.
The film and theatre critic John
Simon’s writing presents a complete
contrast. He is virtually unknown; he is
published in smaller journals, the “New
Leader” and the “Hudson Review.”
He is sober, careful, conservative, dry,
and his style is almost devoid of images.
Yet he is serious in a way Tynan can-
not be: since he does not have to per-
form, and has a name no one is likely
to* remember, since he does not address
a wide middlebrow public but a more
narrow and more serious one, he can
be as searching, as harsh as he chooses.
He is consistently observant and pro-
found (which means, of course, that I
agree with him nearly all the time),
and he is totally unaffected by flummery
and by fashion: his onslaught on God-
ard is masterly, hard, cold, and reason-
able as to make Tynan look frivolous.
With a stern and detached lucidity he
gets to the core of each work, and
reading him after Tynan is like taking
a purgative after a luncheon consisting
entirely of huge, pink cubes of Turkish
Delight.
More, yet less
By NANCY KEESING
The One Day of the Year. Alan Seyr
mour. Souvenir Press. $3.15.
ALAN SEYMOUR HAS NOW
fashioned a novel from his successful
and controversial play of the same
name. How different are the two?
The novel is, of course, very much
fuller. A tremendous amount which
was left to the interpretation of actors
or the imagination of an audience is
here explicit. For example, Alf’s (the
father’s) truculence is shown to be
caused, to a great extent, by his physi-
cal condition, his several chronic dis-
orders being secondary results of an
awkwardly placed war wound. His old
mate, Wacka, is depicted in depth and
detail. Jan’s (the girlfriend’s) involve-
ment is greatly amplified. Her family
background, her father and his crony,
Sam, assume importance, and matters
revolving around their local town hall
are central to the novel, but were not
in the play at all. Hughie, himself, and
Dot, his mother, are less altered, but
prologue and epilogue, both at present-
day Gallipoli, bring Hughie’s disap-
pointing history up-to-date.
The play’s lively dialogue would seem
to have been used in the novel almost
in its entirety, although sometimes in
different sequence. Generally this is a
strength, but, sometimes, especially in
some of Jan’s conversation, it is not a
happy transfer. For instance, Jan, when
she first appeared on stage, had to
convey her superior social status and
wealth verbally. She dropped a couple
of terrible “clangers,” which discon-
certed everyone. Mr. Seymour has not
chosen to modify her remarks. Yet
altogether, Jan, in the novel, is the
character who seems most different.
The complications of many situations
are directly due to her callow and one-
eyed lack of sensitivity or, indeed, of
common honesty.
How does Anzac Day fare? It is dis-
cussed historically, strategically, and,
most of all, of course, as a present-day
celebration. The arguments from every-
one’s viewpoints are analysed, and
people’s feelings about it are consid-
ered very adequately. Some of this
analysis is achieved during a moving
series of reveries (notably Wacka’s).
The result is curious: much of the
shock of the play is dissipated and the
“one day of the year” theme becomes,
at last, no more important to the novel
than the son-father-generation conflicts
at quite personal levels.
Is it a good novel? It is very read-
able; interesting and even contentious,
but lacking the shock and impact of the
play; in other words, f.a.q. —no more.
HOLIDAY AFTERNOON
The fire’s grey hot ash. A whirring of
traffic
hardly ever ceases as the cars
pour north outside my brick fence,
spermatozoa heading
for the wide womblike stretches!
A quarrel with my
daughter about her New Year party
has fizzled out. By naming I’ll anato-
mize
other shapes that poison life
in my all but Egyptian fortress
Item: a tortoise
with popped-up black-and-white shell
eyes
flipping inaudibly along the bookshelf;
Item: my son’s plasticine Thai Buddha;
Item: six purple wilting poppies . . .
My mind’s a grey pit. Another bastard
should have been put into my skin
at birth: someone who’d like
conversation,
chamber music, bus riding,
not this lumpish Other . . .
We’re animals each minute
a hook on which hangs
the carcass looped with strips of
cooling fat, upside down, not us.

Feminine tide
By SANDRA HALL
The Bloomer Girls. Charles Neilson
Gattey. Femina. Books. 35/- sterling.
THERE IS AN endearing straightfor-
wardness and practicality about the
idealism of the Victorian feminists, and
this saga of the American women’s
Battle of the Bloomers captures a lot
of it.
Ironically, Amelia Bloomer herself
was far from being the most radical
of the Bloomer Girls. In fact, Mrs.
Libby Miller was the first person to
wear bloomers in the United States,
having adopted the fashion during a
tour of Europe.
Her cousin, Elizabeth Cady Stanton,
probably the most controversial of all
the American feminists, was the next
person to take to bloomers, then Mrs.
Bloomer followed the lead of her
friends. She had discussed the question
of dress reform in her magazine, “The
Lily,” involving herself in a heavily
sarcastic editorial contest with the con-
servative owner of a rival newspaper.
So after that “it seemed proper that I
should practise as I preached.”
Charles Neilson Gattey talks of all
this in a gentle, dated style which
mirrors the gentility of the ladies them-
selves, a gentility which ihey retained
throughout the most outrageous of their
projects.
He permits himself an occasional
refined jest, pointing out, for example,
that Mrs. Bloomer was fully won over
to the feminist cause only when the
Legislature of Tennessee decided that
women had no right to own property
because they had no souls.
Previously, Mrs. Bloomer, slightly in-
fluenced by the misgivings of her hus-
band, Dexter, had thought Mrs. Stan-
ton and her friends just a little ton
zealous on the question of the women’s
rights.
But when this doubt was cast on the
existence of her soul, her own doubts
vanished. Dexter, too, seems to have
adjusted himself remarkably well to his
wife’s change of heart and apparel, and
we don’t hear another dissenting word
from him for the rest of the book.
As James Laver says in his foreword
to the book, the bloomer fashion was
hardly immodest, since the bloomers
came 'to the ankle and the skirt worn
over them reached half-way between
knee and ankle. Instead, its detractors
focused their disapproval on the fact
that bloomers were trousers, and trousers
were-the symbol of male domination.
Thus, bloomers were a symptom of
something much more serious—feminine
equality. And who knew where that
could iead? Certainly the speeches of
Elizabeth Cady Stanton must have
been enough to strike fear at the heart
of any insecure male wary of this new
tide in feminine thought.
Hers was the first voice to urge votes

for women, but she wasn’t content to
stop there. Decrying the amount of time
women were forced to spend on sewing,
she advocated “that everyone should do
his or her own sewing.”
She was awed by nothing. In 1895,
she published a collection of commen-
taries on every passage in the Bible
which had any reference to women,
calling it “The Women’s Bible, Part
One.” In it, she decided that God was
partly feminine and suggested that “the
Trinity really consisted of Father,
Mother, and Son.”
Sadly, most of the women gave up
the bloomer fashion after three years,
having demonstrated the strength of
their principles. But Gattey, his prose
style sounding even more quaint set
alongside the high-powered phrases of
the London fashion writers, includes a
chapter on the 1967 revival of bloomers.

Europe Series. Rapp and Carroll.

L’Enfant au Cacatoes. Rosemary Dob-
son. Pierre Seghers, Angus and
Robertson. $1.95.
THE EASY accessibility of world
poetry seems proved by the simultan-
eous publication of an English selec-
tion of the poems of the young Finnish
surrealist Pentti Saarikoski in the
“Poetry Europe” series, and a French
selection of Rosemary Dobson’s poems
in Pierre Seghers’ famous “Auteurs
du Monde” collection. Anyone who
wants to keep up with things can,
though the appearance of such books
is only likely to confirm the dictum that
all art of value is first local and
national in interest.
Saarikoski is hard to judge on the
evidence provided, if one can ever
judge translations without a knowledge
of the original. Some of his poems are
“absurd,” like “Not An Inch,” which
consists of two lines of German, one
printed upside down; others have an
aphoristic directness, like “life was
given to man/for him to consider/in
which position/he wants to be dead.”
But I imagine the poems that have
brought him renown are the elliptical,
socio-political pieces on Helsinki and
various events in the modern world.
The author translated “Ulysses” into
Finnish; but these present renderings
convey little in the way of verbal ex-
citement or dexterity.
Rosemary Dobson is almost certainly
the first Australian poet to be published
in bulk in a foreign language. “L’Enfant
au Cacatoes” contains twenty-four
poems from all of her books except
“Cock Crow,” and they have been
beautifully rendered by Louis Dauth-
euil and Margaret Diesendorf, who pro-
vide a most useful potted history of
modern Australian poetry for French
readers. It will be interesting to see
the European reaction to this collec-
tion, which, one hopes, is only the be-
ginning to a larger enterprise.
Books in brief
Australian literary life
Proof Against Failure. Frederick T.
Macartney. Angus and Robertson.
$4.50.
THE EPIGRAPH of Mr. Macartney’s
book is taken from George Eliot and
it contains the significant sentence:
“The only failure a man ought to
fear is failure in cleaving to the pur-
pose he sees to be best.” This series
of autobiographical chapters is almost
an object lesson in cleaving to a pur-
pose. From work as a grocer’s boy, a
sense of purpose drove Macartney on
through the processes of self-education
to a literary career, carried on with in-
tegrity and energy, at the same time
that he worked as a Government offi-
cial. His story is sometimes a moving
one, though it is told too briefly:
Macartney contracts at the very point
one would most like him to expand. Of
special interest are his accounts of
writers like Bernard O’Dowd, the
Palmers, and Furnley Maurice, and
there are sidelights on A. G. Stephens
and Dowell O’Reilly as well as on
betrayals and confusions in the later
literary scene. The book is a valuable
document for anyone studying literary
life in Australia between the wars.
America's adolescent decade
The American 1890 s. Larzer Ziff.
Chatto and Windus. $6.60.
WOULD AMERICANS want to read
what Henry Lawson said about Aus-
tralian society in the 1890 s? That is
the trouble with this well-written
literary-social, history of fin de siecle
U.S. Besides, it was a gawky adoles-
cence in America’s social and literary
development, where ignorant snobs
preferred bad imported wines to bet-
ter local ones and radical young
writers fought entrenched editors and
a puritan public to tell the unvarnished
truth about poverty, sex, and war.
The detail is weighty and the scope
narrow, but it is witty and intelligent,
crammed with titbits of social and
literary color, often the vulgar and
the pompous. The author has cata-
logued everything that Twain, Crane,
James, and Dreiser, and a host of other
writers had to say during the decade
when Americans began to get a nastier
and more complicated picture of them-
selves.


CONNOISSEUR
TABLE WINES
NOTES FROM LIN DEMAN'S
CELLAR MANAGER
For Christmas one of the most appre-
ciated of presents is wine—quality bottled
Table Wine, Champagne or Port. The
pleasure in the present may be shared
by both giver and receiver and wine
offers an almost unique opportunity by
which the personality of the giver can
be expressed. Great care must be exer-
cised in the selection of the wine, for
instance the tastes and preferences of the
recipient should be known or deter-
mined. The quality of the wine selected
of course is of paramount importance.
In this regard Lindemans can help you
enormously by the general recognition
accorded the palatability and outstanding
quality of our wines.
For the medium-sized budget we suggest
our vintage Private Bin table wines, many
of which are Show Prize Winners.
Bin 45 Claret medium-light bodied,
with fine flavour and delicate astringency.
Bin 50 Burgundy round, soft and
smooth on the palate.
Bin 23 Riesling dry, crisp, clean, fresh
and grapy, with great delicacy and soft
flavour.
Bin 11 Moselle fruity and grapy on
both nose and palate.
Bin 77 White Burgundy a full-bodied
yet fresh and delicately flavoured dry
white.
For the more affluent and appreciative
connoisseurs we suggest our Reserve Bin
table wines —vintage wines from the best
vineyards in the best grape growing areas.
Bin 2955 Riesling from Lindemans
vineyards in the Hunter River Valley.
1966 Vintage. Superb flavour and deli-
cacy, and strong Hunter Valley charac-
ter.

Christmas
reflections, '67,
with a warning
ONLY LAST YEAR I warned of “the
approaching situation.” I said con-
sumption was increasing at such a rate
we could have a shortage. We are now
situated right in the middle of that
situation. Not a shortage of wine. Far
from it. Buf a shortage of specific types
of wine, the types that interest the
people who read this column.
I’ve never been reluctant to open
any bottle in my cellar. If you’re a
guest, you’re worth the best. But the
other day during a dinner party I
realised there was about $l2O worth of
wine on the table, even reckoning on
lower prices than those at recent
auctions. They are false prices caused
by the shortage of top, old wines. Thgre
is also a shortage of top, young wines
to replace them. And these cost a
great deal more than I paid for the
matured ones when they were young.
All of which makes it fairly obvious
that we are going to see a lot more
imported wine in this country.
For years we have imported the best
of Bordeaux, some reasonable and other
wines from Burgundy, and a lot of com-
mercial nonsense lurking behind fancy
labels. With a few notable exceptions
among the better wine merchants, not
much attention has been paid to this
kind of importing. Many wine and
spirit houses appear to order by cata-
logue and don’t care much.
But things are changing as local
prices rise. I have recently seen Spanish
and Italian wines of reasonable quality
on sale for less than $1.50 a bottle. I
understand some will be even cheaper
when imported in bulk.
This could help peg local prices. And
a good thing. I don’t mind paying top
prices for top wines, but some of the
other charges, for pleasant ordinary reds
and whites, have become too high.
“WHAT IS your favorite wine?” I am
asked this question often.
I cannot answer simply, simply be-
cause I have so many favorites. I just
like good wine.
But I do get tired of the follow-up
line, “I don’t know anything about
wine but I do know what I like.” If
they know what they like, then at least
they know something. So I suggest that
we all answer the favorite question
in this way: “Well, actually, I know a
great deal about wine. But I don’t
know what I like.”
THE EXTREMELY knowledgeable
English wine writer Edmund Pen-
ning-Rowsell maintains that he always
brushes his teeth in a light white wine,
preferably a Rhine Riesling. I think
this is rather affected. A light Semilion
from the Hunter is just as good.
Though I don’t suggest it’s the wine for
everyone.
Certain TV comperes should use
champagne. Perhaps they would sparkle
a bit more. Or perhaps an N.E. Vic-
torian red for those who want some-
thing to get their teeth into. Gossip
columnists could start their teeth-
gnashing day with an acid Coona-
warra, company chairmen should always
brush with Sauternes before the annual
report, and funeral directors must love
Graves. The trouble is, of course, does
one spit out the rinse?
I THOUGHT the best wine remark
of the year was made by the old master,
Walter James.
Dan Murphy gave us all a very
pleasant lunch. For some reason it
couldn’t have been publicity he gave
my mate Kerr a bottle of ’34 Margaux,
since that was the year of Graham’s
birth.”
Walter murmured, almost to himself,
“If anyone’s thinking of giving me a
bottle, I was born in ’45 or ’47.”
IT REALLY HAPPENED: A young
Sydneysider took his new girl to a
Greek restaurant. They drank Retsina
and rough red and the dancing grew
more and more abandoned. He men-
tioned another Greek place he knew of;
she said she would like to see it. They
drove to the suburb, to find the restau-
rant closed. Still wishing to drink and
dance, they went back to the first
place. Whereupon all the waiters stop-
ped what they were doing to cheer
and clap.
DINER at a prominent hotel: “Waiter,
this white wine is oxidised and has a
peculiar taste.” “Sir, that’s your
whisky.”
A FRIEND decided to blend a wine
for a party. To several flagons of a
trade red he added a couple of bottles
of vintage port and some old white.
The flavor wasn’t bad but the result
lacked bouquet. So he threw in several
handfuls of rose petals. Since quite a
lot of the wine was left over after the
party, he bottled it. Six months later
we opened a bottle. It’s quite good.
Except that it’s got aphids. Well,
nearly.
G. HERBERT, in his “Outlandish
Proverbs,” published in 1640, quotes an
apt thought for the festive season:
“The wine in the bottle does not
quench thirst.”
Merry Christmas!


LETTERS
Marching into the past?
In answer to your lifesavers article
(8., Dec. 2), I would like to give the
true facts to you and your readers.
Regarding a March Past in the
main, teams train in this event with the
object of winning a championship, it
would seem by your article that teams
parade up and down solely for the
glamor created, this is far from fact
—the will to win the National Title
is just as strong here as in all other
events and all other sports.
Finding the type demanding plaudits,
you only have to view the pack of wild
animals featuring long, bleached hair,
under no control, roaming from beach
to beach with surfboards, not caring
who gets in their way. To prove a
point of demanded attention, it was
well remarked by my team whilst
training them at Manly in R & R on
Sunday mornings how these glamor
seekers would be out on their boards
in front of the main crowd, disregard-
ing their appointed area, catching a far
smaller wave than was available in their
area.
The feud you suggest between board-
riders and surf-club members results
from the fact that lifesavers perform
the act their name depicts—the other
pack performs the act of killing people.
The two men you quoted in your
article are both professionals, earning
their living from the surf in two dif-
ferent spheres and I don’t think suit-
able judges of the lifesaver. There
isn’t anything wrong with him the
problem is head-in-the-sand officials
who think licensed clubs should be
allowed even to women bowlers but not
to lifesavers.
A. May
Hurlstone Park, N.S.W.
Charles Higham’s many grossly in-
accurate statements (8., Dec. 2), from
lifesavers boozing while on patrol to
crumbling clubhouse “monasteries,”
were absurd. In fact, his statements,
liberally tarnished with his own biased
comments, would be bloody humorous
if the matter was not so serious and
so could lead many people to wrong
conclusions.
Our allegedly dying organisation is
growing faster than ever, and at present
has thousands more members than ever
before in its long history. Higham is
apparently a bloke who does not
appreciate the surf life saving move-
ment. More than 156,000 people who
owe their lives to it just might.
Robert Wurth
Maroubra, N.S.W.
The nurses' future
The Sydney medical practitioner
who made such controversial state-
ments (8., Nov. 18) was disclosing
only a travesty of the truth about
the nursing profession. He mentioned
anomalies in the nursing system of
which we are already aware.
Steps are being taken by the Royal
Australian Nursing Federation, to im-
prove the standard and status of the
nursing profession. He, as a member
of his own profession and as a part
of the health team which has as
its goal provision for a safe and
adequate health service to the com-
munity, should be doing all in his
power to ensure that nursing services
do not continue to function at their
present levels.
A prominent medical figure stated
in Brisbane recently that medicine and
medical practices cannot advance to
the fullest degree unless nursing ad-
vances also. How refreshing it was to
receive encouraging, instead of dis-
paraging, remarks!
Diana Williams,
State secretary,
Student Nurse Unit,
R.A.N.F. (Queensland).
Brisbane, Qld.
May I reply to April Hersey, on
behalf of our nursing staff, and ask
“General Practitioner” when he last
worked in a hospital as a member of
a team? As a matron of a busy sur-
gical hospital, I would hasten to en-
lighten him that I certainly could not
carry out my exacting work if I were
of low-grade intelligence. Further,
could I carry it out without the back-
ing of a capable staff? All professions,
trades, etc., entail a certain repetition
of duty.
Far from being constructive, such
criticism could be expected from the
“lower half of the class.” Any in-
struction, from any doctor, needs to
be taken with care and intelligence,
and carried out with equal care. Pills
and potions are easily handed out,
so are the wrong ones. My compliments
to “General Practitioner” who can
manage with waitresses, and ward-
maids. I fear our surgeons could not.
W. M. Stockwell
Wellington, N.Z.
Uneasy maternity
Ross Campbell dismisses the subject
of modern childbirth with unnecessary
flippancy in his article (8., Dec. 2). He
assumes that women either believe in
the “maternity horror-tales” of old, or
go in for a lot of modern, “merry-and-
bright” gymnastics.
There is a middle road—a serious
road, where women train in the latest
Lamaze, or psycho - prophylactic,
method of childbirth. A woman trained
in this method is well aware of the
many irritating and sometimes serious
conditions accompanying pregnancy,
but does this mean she should
be unhappy? The “modern pre-natal
gymnastics” mentioned by Mr. Camp-
bell are a very small part of the train-
ing. The more detailed breathing and
controlled relaxation techniques teach
her how to control her labor, to make
it as rewarding as possible for her —-
and for her baby.
Mrs. Errol Broome
Sandringham, Vic.
Teachers and nurses
While one may have some sympathy
with teachers and nurses, they lose our
esteem when they become pretentious
or snobbish about their particular skill
and education.
The world will not and does not take
any of us at our own valuation, we are
all interdependent, and value is an
elusive thing which varies from day
to day and from person to person.
J. Hull
Gladesville, N.S.W.
Wool and tariffs
The Department of Trade and Industry
calculated (8., Dec. 2) that tariff duties
added $392 to the costs of materials
used by the “average” N.S.W. grower
of wool who receives 52.7 percent
of his returns from wool, according to
the BAE sheep industry survey.
Of the $392 added cost, $207 is
attracted by wool production, leaving
the balance of $lB5 (47.3 percent) to
be carried by this “average” grower’s
other products, along with the residue
of the $207 not offset by the Govern-
ment’s contribution to research and
promotion expenditure. This offsetting
compensation is, of course, not received
by the producer, whose sheep die from
drought before he gets his clip.
The real weakness in this approach
to measuring the cost-raising effects of
tariffs is that it takes no account of
the effects on prices for labor and
services, about half the cash costs of
the average producer.
