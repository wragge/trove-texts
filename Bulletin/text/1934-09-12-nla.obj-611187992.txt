HIS BOOKS
English Humor
Social contrasts have always formec
its chief basis. Take away the class joke
from “Punch” and there would be littl
left. The gossip-writer of a Londoi
paper related “a highly-amusing anec
dote of King Edward and Queen Alex
andra which I do not remember seein
before.” ,
Aboardship, King Edward ordered tea
tor 4.30 and the Admiral duly reported
this to the Queen, who was on the bridge
amusing herself with her Kodak. “Oh,
no,” the Queen smilingly answered, “we’ll
have it at five.” “Shall I tell his Majesty
that, ma’am?” asked the Admiral, and this
was done. “Well, if she said five it must
be five,” laughed Edward VII. And so it
was!
Here we have the secret of an im
mense volume of English humor ; it i
the man rather than the matter tha
counts. Analyse the gags of a Burling
ton Bertie and there is nothing in them
they are funny because the speake
patronises the right tailor. If the pro
duct of a board or grammar schoo
tried to get laughs on similar lines ht
would be regarded by Britons of al
classes with loathing. • Here are three
examples of popular styles in English
humor which illustrate different aspects
of an interesting phenomenon.
One of the Old School
The Lord of the Manor, by John
Hastings Turner (Heinemann ; 7s. 6d.)
is in the Wodehouse tradition. Sir Henry
Bovey, the choleric, pig-fancying squire
of Stagbovey Manor, is the real centre
of interest, though his charming wife
irresponsible son and others have im-
portant parts. The contrast between his
feudal ideas and manners and the con-
duct of the three members of the unem-
ployed who are forced on him and his
by a Government edict is the cream of
the joke. Tover, the boozy, cheeky old
ex-soldier, would be tiresome in his
natural surroundings ; as a guest at Stag-
bovey Manor, he becomes comic. When
he tries to blackmail his host, General
Sir George Fleeter takes him in hand.
“What was your regiment, Tover?” he
snapped.
“Second Middlesex.”
“Rank?”
“Private,”
“When you speak to me, say ‘sir.’ How
long did you serve?”
And so it goes on till
Sir George brought his fist down with a
crash upon the refectory table.
“Look here, Tover,” he said. “I’m sick
of you! You’ve been up in the orderly-
room too often.”
“Yes, sir.”
“You’re a disgrace to your company and
a disgrace to your regiment. You always
have been, haven’t you? And you’re not
properly sober now?”
“No, sir.”
/‘Very avell, then —you're fined five shil-
lings, and you can do seven days’ C. 8.”
Of course, it wouldn’t have happened,
Tover being a wily old realist, but how
quaint, and what a tribute to British mili-
tary discipline and to the moral force
of England’s ruling classes, if it had!
All the sympathetic characters are
likeable, and they are so familiar in
literature and on the stage that they seem
real.
Edwardians
Morris Davidson’s Calore Park (Cas-
sell’s ; Dymock’s; 7s. 6d.) is much more
than a skit; it revives a type of novel
that was taken seriously 30-odd years
ago. The social outlook, the language—
with its absence of slang and Ameri-
canisms it seems oddly stilted —the
ponderous chaff, the reticence as regards
sex, emphasise the tremendous changes
that have occurred since Queen Vic-
toria’s death.
Of course, Major “Johnny” Bloodshot,
the 43-year-old hero, is exaggerated, but
he isn’t burlesqued. There were hundreds
more or less like him in the service clubs
and at resorts such as Southsea and
Cheltenham before the war; genial
asses who made a virtue of illiteracy and
despjsed artists and writers and soldiers
who swotted at soldiering; who revered
sportsmen and the ladies, and were brim-
ming over with
sentiment. Major
Bloodshot, while
visiting Cal o r e
Park for the an-
nual croquet tour-
nament, meets a
pretty cousin. After dinner he asks her
to sing “Come Into the Garden, Maud,”
being a little drunk, as he and his friends
invariably are on “joining the ladies.”
The lovely creature hung her head,
coloring.
“I will sing it then,” she breathed, “for
you.”
Did ever soldier hear fairer words?
Softly she struck the keys. Her voice
trilled in an ecstasy of emotion and tears
sprang to my eye. Though I am not a
Hayden Coffin, 1 could not forbear from
• joining in:
“And the planet of love is on high;
IVhut are we waiting for, O my heart?”
1 sang in a light baritone voice to
Hebbie’s:—
“Queen of the rosebud garden of girls,
Come hither, the dances are done”....
Aye, a thousand times aye, what a
queen she was! What a figure of a woman,
irresistibly reminding me of St, Cecilia.
My heart swelled within me as I awaited
my cue.
“She is coming, my own, my sweet,” the
s °ng gushed on. I joined her. As she
shook her finger at me and swayed her
head I redoubled my efforts.
“Good-bye for ever,” I sang. “Good-bye
for ever.”
Hebbie is making use of him, most
of the others regard him as a bore, he
is useless at croquet, but his stupidity
and conceit keep him self-satisfied to the
end.
This novel isn’t nearly so amusing as,
say, “ The Londoners.” Hichens laughed
at people whom he knew, whereas Mr.
Davidson’s satire is directed at an imag-
ined period, and some of the characters
(Hebbie, for example) are Victorian
rather than Edwardian. It makes a
special appeal to croquet players, but
anybody who likes a laugh will enjoy it.
Whimsy
If a biography of Sherlock Holmes
had to be written it is hard to see that
it could have been done in a different
vein from that which Vincent Starred
has exploited in The Private Life of Sher-
lock Holmes (Nicholson and Watson:
Bs. 6d.).
Victoria was still placidly upon her
throne; Lord Salisbury—for the second
time—-had ousted Gladstone from the
Piemier’s chair; Ireland was seething with
outrage and sedition At the Gaiety,
Mr. Cellier’s “Dorothy” had begun its
celebrated run of 968 performances, and
“The Harbor Lights" were gleaming
brightly at the Adelphi.
On such mock Stracheyesque lines is the
hero’s appearance led up to. Mr. Star-
red is a persistent one-ef\
There is, to-day, one reads, a tablet on
the villa [the one Conan Doyle lived in
at Southseal, and "Doyle House" is a
place of tourist interest. As the birthplace,
so to speak, of Sherlock Holmes, it should
be marked, one thinks, by national decree.
About half-way through we find this:
But one must drop, at last, the happy
prfetence; admit that Sherlock Holmes is
dead. And being dead yet liveth, The
paradox is complete ; the tale is ended.
And Mr, Starrett discusses the Edalji
and Slater cases, writes a chapter about
Sherlock Holmes on stage and screen,
quotes from parodies on the stories (and
how feeble they seem in this setting!),
and winds up with an epilogue, examina-
tion papers on Holmes's activities, a
“selected bibliography” and “other Sher-
lockian matters of Interest to the Col-
lector.”
1 his kind of facetiousness is peculiarly
British, and it convulses some people.
A matter of taste.

is the best personal reference book that

After-meal Pains
Sour Acid Stomach
Griping Pains
Be Warned of Serious Danger
Suffocating stuffiness, heart palpitat-
ing, flatulence, heartburn, griping
pains, all tell of acid stomach or some
form of digestive trouble. Are you
waiting for more serious trouble to
develop such as ulceration, gastritis,
colitis, bowel weakness, the misery of
chronic dyspepsia ?
Why not let the new-principle remedy
for Indigestion, De Witt’s Antacid
Powder, stop your pain and danger
quickly—permanently P
Sufferers say its effect is marvellous,
quick and lasting. No more miserable
pain. Back comes the old splendid
appetite.
This New-Principle Remedy
Stops Indigestion Quickly
Here are just two from a host of
letters from those once in misery
because of “neglected indigestion,”
now pain-free—thanks to De Witt’s
Antacid Powder for Indigestion.
Mrs. Laughran, of 116 Northbrook
Street, Princes Park, Liverpool, Eng.,
says :—“ My husband suffered intense
pain from indigestion. He was in very
bad pain and under the doctor. We
thought we were going to lose him
for he was getting no better. He
really was in agony, so learning about
De Witt’s Antacid Powder I sent for
some and gave my husband one tea-
spoonful whilst he was in bed in agony.
At once he went to sleep and had a
real good night’s rest, and each day he
has improved. He is a different man.
You can understand how grateful we
are for learning about your remedy. It
is the best we have tried—and we have
tried many remedies. It should be
more widely known.”
GASTRIC TROUBLE ENDED
Mr. W. Best, 152 Carlingford Rd.,
West Green, N. 15, England, says:—
“ For many years I was a martyr to
severe gastric trouble, and was never
free from pain. One day I read about
De Witt’s Antacid Powder, and
decided to give it a trial. I was really
astounded at the quick relief it gave
me, and I can now eat and enjoy a
hearty meal. I am truly thankful for
the relief De Witt’s Antacid Powder
has given me.”
De Witt’s Antacid Powder for
Indigestion is quite different from
ordinary purging salts or strong soda
products. The nine specially selected
ingredients of this new remedy neu-
tralise pain-causing acidity, soothe and
strengthen the digestive system and
actrilly aid the digestion of food.
Here is sound advice we give to
every sufferer from indigestion trouble.
Go to your chemist now. Ask for and
be sure you get —

columns; the Macarthurs and Mac-
arthur-Onslows five. As against which
the Clarkes (of R,upertswood), who have
cut wide swathes in Australian pastoral-
ist, political and commercial life in every
generation during the past hundred years,
only occupy a column and a half. The
-v Osbornes, who probably form our big-
gest pastoral family, don’t get a mention ;
neither do the Chirnsides nor the Mc-
Phillamys nor the Bruxners. The only
Ryrie referred to is the general.
Mr. Johns was interested in writers,
journalists, artists, theatrical stars and,
to a somewhat less extent, in cricketers.
Nearly all with any pretensions to fame
in these categories are noticed, and the
notices are adequate and balanced —in
short, they show knowledge.
The pioneer-merchants receive scant
attention. We are told about the Hor-
derns, but not about the Buckleys. There
are a few lines about Simeon Lord ; no-
thing about the Milsons, Burdekins or
Parburys.
All this is not to say that Mr. Johns
was a poor biographer ; he was an excep-
tionally good one. It simply means that
his task was too big for any one man.
The compilation of such a work as this
calls for the help and advice of those
who have absorbed Australian family
history with their mothers’ milk. One
or two of them would have filled up
most of Mr. Johns’s lacunae and kept his
values level; and they would not have
been hard to find.
OLD-TIMER.
Heart's Ease at Howe Island
In Mary Marlowe’s Psalmist of the
Dawn (Endeavour Press ; 4s. 6d.) a bril-
liant young Sydney surgeon finds his sight
failing, and is told by a specialist to
stop operating. Comes a call to attend
a youth who has been mauled by a shark.
He operates, and is so impressed by the
pluck of the patient, who is from Lord
Howe Island, that he visits that Pacific
paradise and meets the Girl. The Girl has
lost the singing-voice which had pro-
mised her a brilliant career in light opera.
He does some operating in defiance of
the ban when his skill and experience are
needed. And, listening to “the psalmist
of the dawn”—which is the cheery little
yellow-breasted tui-yui of our own mal-
treated coastal scrubs—they live happily
ever after. .
The love-passages are effectively and
delicately handled, and some interesting
sidelights are cast on the Administration.
Her: “How’s the baby?”
Him: “Better than six months’ board to
me. He’s thriving. 1 think they’d have
deported me as an undesirable if he wasn’t.
Sound idea, that deporting. I wonder
who came under the Island axe last?
Some poor devil of a dipso., I expect.
They tell me that all secret drinkers get
their tickets back from here.”
Her: “You mean that?”
Him: “You bet I mean it. The Island
is too small for undesirables. One dipso,
could finish us all off in a night if he
went berserk! .... I was told where I stood
as soon as I landed, ‘Drink what you can
carry, doctor, and no more If you’re
here to booze stay in your own room
and do it on your own. If you
introduce bad habits to others, or if you’re
seen drunk on the waterfront, back you
go by the next ship! ’ ”
It’s an interesting novel, partly because
Miss Marlowe knows human nature,
partly because she knows Lord Howe
Island.
O. C.
The Compleat Painter
Arthur Streeton, writing in Melbourne
“Argus,” praised a fellow-artist’s work
for its beauty, delicacy, and so
forth; but he went on to complain of its
incompleteness. He used the word “com-
plete” and derivatives four times and
the word “finish” once, and he stated
that Velasquez and other great artists
not only strove for completeness, but
achieved it. It seems to me that if young
artists accept this dictum they are lost.
If Dostoieffsky, Shakspeare, Ibsen,
Maupassant and Chekhov got together
and started to discuss, say, jealousy in
women, they might or they might not
come to some tentative conclusion. If
they did, though they might say that it was
right as far as it went, I am sure they
would never claim that they had attained
to completeness and that there was noth-
ing more to be said on the subject. If
they were silly enough to do so, and if
James Joyce and D. H. Lawrence came
along, the newcomers would immediately
be able to show them that they were
stodgy academicians ; and if Freud then
joined the party he would throw so much
fresh light on the matter that they would
positively be blinded and in no condition
to consider the fresh illumination poured
on the discussion by the advent of a
peppery but persuasive old gentleman
who would turn out.to be the Russian
Pavlov.
Tolstoy defined art as an impression
of nature which the artist endeavors to
re-create through his medium. The de-
gree to which he gives it back will depend
on his understanding of the impression,
and human understanding has never
attained to completeness in the arts, any
more than it has in the sciences. If
Newton had claimed completeness for
his deductions from the behavior of a
falling apple he would have laid himself
open to a nasty jolt from Professor
Einstein. But no scientists make such
pretensions as Mr. Streeton ascribes to
the painter, and if they did they would
have both the philosophers and the theo-
logians down on them like a ton of
bricks.
Rembrandt, after he had attained to a
greater degree of knowledge than any of
his contemporaries, was content to spend
his last years in front of a mirror painting
his head over and over again, though in
his younger days he had painted enor-
mous canvases with scores of people in
them. The only artists who achieve “com-
pleteness” are those who confine their
impressions inside a set of easily recog-
nised conventions. The academicians
survey the tentative essays of artists and
writers who have gone before them and
make a formula out of them. The “com-
plete” work of art in the drama is the
melodrama, and the “complete” work of
art in the novel is the potboiler.

Film Quotas and the Exhibitor
The average Australian exhibitor
doesn’t own a chain of gilt theatres, nor
do Wurlitzers accompany his carollings
in the morning bath. But he is to be
found throughout the cities and suburbs
and in the bush, for the talkies are more
popular than ever. His is no easy job.
The public is more discerning than ever ;
it shops for its amusement just as it
does for wearing apparel or groceries.
The average exhibitor must find what it
wants or join the breadline, and it is
he who will have to shoulder the real
burden of quota legislation.
Three or four years ago there was not
a worth-while Australian feature film on
the market. To-day there is a number
capable of drawing appreciative audi-
ences, and newsreels figure on every pro-
gramme. This can definitely be classed
as progress in Australian production,
and normal, healthy progress of the right
kind.
Exhibitors have given these worth-
while Australian pictures good booking,
even though they are much dearer to
screen on an average than films from
American or British exchanges. Distri-
butors of American pictures ask only
fifty-fifty for what they consider a world-
beater ; for films not in that class they
take less. On the other hand, fifty-fifty
is demanded in the case of nearly every
Australian picture of any pretension;
and I ought to know. Payment on this
scale can be made once in a while when
the picture is reasonably good entertain-
ment. But all will admit that Aus-
tralians have made pictures which can
only be classed as terrible. Imagine the
position of exhibitors forced by quota
to screen them at the present ambitious
prices! Not only would they empty
theatres; they would also quickly sicken
the public of all Australian films.
Good pictures can only be made by
experts, and they cost money. These
two essentials should be provided by the
Government if it wants to build up an
industry, and is not satisfied with what
private enterprise is doing. Failing that,
its own phrase, “hands off,” is the best
advice it can offer itself.
EXHIB.
A Satchel of Books
Autumn Leaves, by L. L. Politzer
(“Pan” Publishing House, Melb.). Mr.
Politzer’s gentle muse, which suggests the
ghost of T. S. Eliot taking tea with the
late Mrs. Hemans, is concerned with the
emotions of a looker-on at life vaguely
speculating about the problems of exist-
ence. It has the service of Harold Her-
bert’s equally gentle pencil, and the litho-
graphed illustrations are as fine examples
of the printer’s art as have been pro-
duced in Melbourne. Some prose love
letters are in much the same mood as
the verses.
Shabby Tiger, by Howard Spring
(Collins; 7s. 6d.), is an underworld study
with Manchester and environs as a back-
ground. Anna, the fantastic heroine, with
her ragged clothes, man’s hat trimmed
with a green feather and scarlet suitcase,
picks up with Nick Faunt, an artist-hobo,
in a Cheshire lane, and they end by get-
ting married. The characters would have
been more interesting if their creator
hadn’t tried so hard to make them
bizarre. Anna mentions that her late
father was “kicked in the guts” by a
horse. When she repeats the infor-
mation the reader feels she is taking
a snobbish pride in her outspoken-
ness, and the reaction is a mild
form of irritation. There are some fine
descriptive passages, and two or three
chapters in which the futility of unem-
ployed demonstrators vis-a-vis the British
police is grimly emphasised.
Gog Magog, by G. W. Stonier (Dent
Literature, Melb.; Bs. 6d.), is a collection
of essays by an English critic of emi-
nence. They are brightly written, but
give one an impression that the writer
is the kind of critic who amuses himself
by putting works he couldn’t have written
into neat little pigeonholes. He finds the
keynote to modern literature in what he
calls “the disintegration of bourgeois
personality with the war and the prospect
of Communism ahead.” He finds that
in Proust, Strindberg and others a
new sort of genius has emerged—the
invalid. Proust’s asthma and hay-fever
have no more necessarily to do with the
quality of his work than the fact that
Nietzsche was at times certainly mad.
Tolstoy defined the artist as one who
receives an impression from nature and
endeavors to give it back by means of his
medium. Being a great artist, Tolstoy
could demonstrate his creed. Not being
a great artist, Mr. Stonier can only fit
art into categories.
In The Loch Ness Monster and Others
(files ; 10s. 6d.) Lieut.-Commander R. T.
Gould, R.N. (ret.), testifies to his belief
in the best-advertised underwater serpent
of modern times. . There are three full-
page photographs of the monster in
action, and a dozen small sketches by
various witnesses. The average Briton,
outside Scotland, is facetious at the
expense of the monster. The Scot is not;
it has been a boon to Caledonia’s tourist
trade. Hostile critics are divided roughly
into those who decline to believe there
is anything portentous in Loch Ness and
those who admit that something has been
seen, and argue that it is a giant tor-
toise, an Australian sunfish (a specimen
was once killed at Greenock), a giant ray
from Florida, a catfish or a salamander.
The “Querqueville carcass” (25 feet long
and “a thin neck with a head resembling
that of a camel”), which was examined
by French Natural History Museum
officials last February, strangely re-
sembles the pictures that have appeared
of the Loch Ness monster. Sir Edward
Mountain recently engaged 20 watchers,
complete with field-glasses, to patrol the
loch from daylight to dark, so there may
be fresh evidence before long. Stories
about the existence of a strange creature
in Loch Ness have been current for
nearly half a century.
The Message of Asia, by Paul Cohen-
Portheim, translated by Alan Harris
(Duckworth; Booklovers’, Melb.; 9s.
6d.). This German author, who has
some standing on the Continent as a
popular philosopher, was interned in
England during the war. He observed
that even within the camp prisoners
were divided into grades, castes and
sections and that hatred and jealousy
grew up between the various divisions.
If this could occur in such circum-
stances, he argued, there was no hope
for humanity except by the individual
merging himself in the Universal Spirit.
This conclusion brought him to the study
of Eastern esoteric wisdom, and he has
been subsequently endeavoring to mix
Western practicability and Oriental
mysticism into a working philosophy.
The system breaks down when it is
applied to art, and the author gets into
a rare muddle when he tries to define
the meaning of realism. He is most
interesting where he deals with the psy-
chology of sex, and there is more of
the science of the West than the wisdom
of the East in his chapter on Men and
Women.
Music and the Listener, by Keith
Barry (Robertson and Mullens ; 2s. 6d.),
has reached a second edition, as it
deserved to do. It reads as if it were a
labor of love to its writer, who draws
upon ripe musical experience. His
judgments are gentle and tolerant, and
his exposition of the rudiments of the
art and the character of its forms is
clear and concise and not lacking in
humor. From music, as from any other
source of aesthetic pleasure, one can, as
Dr. Barry remarks, get no more than
one can give. This little book should
help anyone—and most of all the army
of one-instrument musicians—to a great
deal of enhanced enjoyment of the ex-
cellent . musical fare now available in
any home through the agency of the
radio and the gramophone.
A Witness Through the Centuries, by
Dr. Reginald Hegy (Rider and Co.;
Dymock’s ; 55.). The author claims that
medical experiences set him “upon a
new path of thought followed by
actual proof of survival of the self, along
with its memories, individuality and
affections.” He relates a number of ex-
periences, and concludes with warnings
against fraudulent mediums, a defence
of spiritualism based on the Christian
religion, and an appendix—“ How to
Form Your Own Home Circle.”

ONLY ONE ISSUE.
It is a deplorable thing that the Com-
monwealth election should be fought
on the issue of the banks. There are
subjects of pressing importance to the
electors on which they are far more
qualified to arrive at sound judgments:
at any rate, they have, or ought to have,
the knowledge requisite for decisions as
to how the Government has coped
with the depression; whether the
Federal system works well or ill;
whether or not the tariff is doing its job
and whether the multitude of taxes and
taxing authorities makes for efficiency.
But what do they know about banking
and currency, and what can they learn
of value from the shouts of partisans in
a political campaign?
Yet this issue has been forced on the
country by the two wings of the Labor
Opposition and, in a minor degree, by
the Douglas Credit cranks. An elec-
torate dazed with propaganda, but for
the most part uninstructed, will have to
decide for or against the banks.
There are nine trading banks proper,
working under the Scottish system of
branch banking, and the Common-
wealth Bank. The Commonwealth Bank
competes with the trading banks to some
extent, keeps the Commonwealth Gov-
ernment accounts, performs the functions
of a central bank and has charge of the
note issue. Its board is independent of
political control. The U.A.P. and the
C.P. maintain that this arrangement has
worked well and that it would be hazard-
ous to tamper with it. They point out
that, apart from a small concern with
insufficient funds which would probably
have failed anyhow, the only bank
that has gone bung during the depres-
sion has been the N.S.W. Savings Bank, in
which accounts were “guaranteed by the
Government,” and which, when the crisis
came, proved to have been virtually
under political control. In short, the party
in office and (if that party fails of a
majority) the party which may take office
with it stand up for the banks and will
permit no monkeying with them.
Both Labor factions attack the banks.
The forcible-feeble Mr. Scullin calls
them “the money-masters,” and accuses
them of having brought a million Aus-
tralians to the verge of starvation. Mr.
Lang is fiercer in his language and has
hired a chain of radio stations for six
Sunday nights to catalogue their in-
iquities. Mr. Scullin proposes to dis-
miss the Commonwealth Bank Board
and place the bank under the con-
trol of a single director answerable,
he declares, to Parliament (he means the
predominant clique in Caucus). This he
calls “nationalised banking,” and the
“nationalised” bank is to engage in a
mortal struggle with the trading banks.
What would be their attitude to this com-
petition? The chairman of the Associated
Banks of Victoria ha§ expressed it pithily:
The competition would be unfair—
that much has been made clear. Would
the banks continue until their assets had
been dissipated? No, they would close
voluntarily—call in their advances, with-
draw their current deposits, totalling
nearly £30,000,000, from the Common-
wealth Bank (no interest is paid on these
deposits), sell their buildings and sites,
pay their creditors and depositors, dismiss
their staffs, distribute their assets to share-
holders and leave others to find the
£2,000,000 p.a. they now pay in taxes.
This prospect does not appal the leader
of the other Labor faction, if he ever
considers it. Rushing blindly along
the road where Mr. Scullin somewhat
timidly treads, he would “nationalise the
banks” and “socialise credit.” In other
days Governments, his above all, went
on the loan market. No more of that!
We propose that the Government should
draw credit from its own credit resources,
paying only the cost of the service. This
means that in the place of an annual
heavy interest charge there will be one
very small cost, which will not recur.
The printing cost, in short. “National-
ised banking” and “socialised credit”
achieved, he will straightway re-employ
“the pick-and-shovel army”:
The depression in Australia commenced
with the sudden cessation of loan money,
which threw thousands out of work. When
this army of workmen became our first
army of workless, it took out of the com-
munity a purchasing power of 40 or 50
million pounds a year. Our first task must
be to restore that purchasing power. For
the first year our rate of expenditure must
be greater than it was in the year before
the depression.
Simultaneously, the working week is to
be shortened, and a great deal more
“credit” is to be employed “to force
prices, wages and employment up to rea-
sonable levels and, by having control of
the banking system, to hold them there.”
He calls this reflation. It is, of course,
mflation, the exploded policy of half-
breed republics; the dishonest expedi-
ent that ruined Germany and in the
fullness of time delivered it over to a dic-
tatorship. /nflation on a crazy plan that
would necessitate frequent and ever-
increasing issues of currency, depreciat-
ing with every issue; that would reduce
all business to a gamble; that would
destroy most of the savings of the thrifty
and with them the incentive to save ; that
would make “the large army of Govern-
ment employees” the Praetorian Guards
of the electorates and force loyal Com-
monwealth people to turn secessionist,
since secession would seem the only
alternative to ruin.
It is hoped that the inflation policy
will appeal to all debtors, though
debtors are also creditors. Along with
reduction of debts by inflation there is to
be a “writing-down of debts”: by enact-
ment in Australia —regardless of the
effect on banks, life-insurance cos.,
friendly and co-op. societies and the rest
—and by ‘'‘negotiation” (in the truculent
Lang vein) abroad. If overseas creditors
decline to “negotiate” and retaliate with
a boycott, Australians are to shut out
imports arid consume their tremendous
surpluses of wool, skins, butter, wheat,
fruit and base metals somehow, or not pro-
duce surpluses. In other words, Australia
is to become another Free State Ireland
in everything but size and vulnerability.
These ideas are not British or Austra-
lian ideas; they are alien ideas. While
the right of the distressed subject to be
cared for by the State has been accepted
since the days of the Tudors, and has
been recognised in our unemployed-relief
measures, it has never been part of the
British scheme to convert Parliament
into an instrument for the redistribution
of wealth. Until imitation De Valeras
and O’Duffys came along, it was never
seriously proposed in any English-speak-
ing country to commandeer the savings
of the thrifty, separate them by jugglery
into, say, four parts and divide three
parts among the needy. All the courage
and self-reliance which Australians have
shown in all their activities would have
to ooze out of them before this vast ex-
tension of the power of the politician
could be accepted. So that those with
bank balances and investments are not in
the least likely to let herbs like Lang,
Scullin and Beasley assume control of
them. But it would be a calamity if the
thing were tried, and there is a real
danger that it will be.
People in distress are apt to believe
that any change of' Government will
improve their condition. The minds of
old-age and invalid pensioners have been
inflamed against the Government, and
they control quite 400,000 votes. “Labor”
is still a word of power, and many
honest people vote the ticket with-
out bothering their heads about the
political crimes planned or committed
in “Labor’s” name. Many more see
in Lang a persecuted hero of democ-
racy who will yet triumph over his
enemies and lead the people into a land
filled with good jobs and flowing with
easy money. And although there are
still two Labor factions, even Labor
wrangles come to an end, and the
moderates always surrender to the ex-
tremists. The party in office is stodgy,
self-satisfied and deficient in inspiring
leadership; but in the circumstances that
have arisen a U.A.P. or a U.A.P.-C.P.
Government, the latter for preference, is
necessary to Australia. A Labor Gov-
ernment controlling both Houses would
bring about a crisis worse than the crisis
of 1931, and it might be only the begin-
ning of the chapter.
THE MAJOR’S MILLENNIUM.
Those who intend to vote for Douglas
Credit candidates are reminded that
patience is a virtue. Not even the major
is independent of time, and, although
“work” is to be “definitely provided for
everybody within a few months,” other
features of the programme will make
more exacting demands on the unfor-
giving minute. To wipe out the national
debt, “reduce taxation to the point of
elimination,” establish economic security
and a higher living standard, give land-
men control of their own markets at
“satisfactory rates of profit” and enable
all manufacturers to “compete against the
most intense foreign competition” it will
take quite two years —that is, “two after
the party gets into power.” Supporters
must not grumble at the delay, especially
as an “interim policy” is offered.
All pensioners and persons on the dole
are to have their allowances at once in-
creased to 255. a week. Family endow-
ment is to go up to 10s. a week for un-
employed under 18. And
It will not be necessary to impose any
form of taxation such as unemployed-
relief, sales tax or endowment tax.
Neither will taxation be needed to pay for
land-settlement and defence programmes
or for bounties on produce. All mar-
keting is to be socialised under a central
bureau, which will buy all goods “out-
right”—buy “on delivery at prices based
on costs,” plus agreed (but not imposed)
“maximum rate of profit.” World markets
will be dealt with as well as local mar-
kets, and any deficits will be met by the
Commonwealth Government.
Property owners are to be on a soft
wicket, too. They are to be “invited to
accept rental rates not greater than those
of 1929, less statutory reductions” ; in
return, all their property taxes will be
rebated. The Commonwealth is to take
over arbitration, and the 40-hour week
and 1929 wages will rule, though there
will be kindly consideration for the em-
ployer. All extra imposts on him the
Commonwealth will pay in subsidies.
Manufacturers and wholesalers are to
have tax rebates, too, if they sell at an
agreed profit. But they are to be
licensed, and if they refuse to take out
licenses they will be obliterated.
And how is it all to be financed? In
the easiest way in the world. When the
marketing pool or the wholesalers want
a few millions or the civil service needs
a 50 p.c. rise, the governor of the Com-
monwealth Bank will send for the Gov-
ernment Printer and say: “We’re short
of a few million-pound Treasury bills—•
send ’em along, will you?” These he
will discount at face value:
There is positively no reason why the
Commonwealth Bank should not make
available to this nation £lOO of credit for
each £lOO worth of lOUs.
It is all so simple that the wonder is
that no one ever thought of it before.
Europe need never have borrowed from
the Rothschilds, Britain need never have
gone into debt to . Uncle Sam, Napoleon
need never have plundered Italy had
Douglas preceded Adam Smith. Empires
have perished because their rulers failed
to discover that money is only paper
issued to any figure the potentate of the
moment pleases against assets on which
he sets his own value.
THE CHANCES CONSIDERED.
In some respects there has never been
so puzzling a Commonwealth election.
Not only are there more parties and
candidates in the field than ever before,
but uncertain factors have been intro-
duced by schisms in the other parties, by
the Douglas Credit agitation, which has
made considerable headway in New South
Wales, and by redistribution of seats in
that State, Queensland and South Aus.
If wagering were permissible, it would
be safe to wager that no single party
will come back with a majority. The
U.A.P. will be the strongest, but it is
certain to lose some of the 37 House of
Reps, seats (38, with the accession of
Groom) which it won three years ago,
and is very unlikely to make correspond-
ing gains. U.A.P. electorates in danger
are Lang, Barton and Macquarie
(N.S.W.); Batman, Maribyrnong, Bal-
larat, Indi and Bendigo (Vic.); Adelaide
and Grey (S.A.); Denison, Franklin and
Bass (Tas.). Most of them may be held ;
indeed, U.A.P. prospects have distinctly
brightened, especially in Victoria, where
it is increasingly obvious that the average
elector has little use for Mr. Scullin’s
leadership and less for Mr. Lang’s, and is
sick of Country-party wrangling.
The Country party emerged from the
1931 election with 16 seats in the House.
It may lose one or two, though once it
arrives in an electorate it takes some
shifting. In Calare and New England
(N.S.W.) the C.P. members have U.A.P.
opposition, and, by way of retaliation,
two Agrarians are out against Gardner
(U.A.P.) in Robertson. There is little
bitterness in these struggles, and the
sitting members are expected to win.
Scullin-Labor is relatively strongest in
Queensland, where it holds five of the
State’s 10 seats in the House and three
of its six in the Senate. It is confident of
retaining the five (Brisbane, Capricornia,
Griffith, Herbert and Kennedy), and
boasts that it will lift the scalps of Francis
in Moreton and Hunter in Maranoa.
The other side, for its part, professes
that it will capture Brisbane and Herbert.
It is highly improbable that there will
be any pronounced change.
Lang-Labor starts with five safe N.S.W.
seats (Dailey, East Sydney, West Sydney,
Hunter and Reid). Lang it ought to gain,
for strong Lang-Labor subdivisions have
been added to that altered electorate;
and it expects to win Barton and Wer-
riwa, though his local pull is helping
Lane in Barton, and Tom ,Mutch is get-
ting unexpectedly good receptions in the
South Coast electorate. The redistribu-
tion has dashed Lang-Labor’s hopes of
adding Watson (formerly South Sydney)
to its collection. In no other State is
it running a ticket, though it has sym-
pathisers in some.
The Douglas Credit people nominated
16 candidates in N.S.W. Most of them
will get a fair number of primary votes,
but nowhere are they likely to be lead-
ing at the end of the count. They will
have to win on preferences if they are
to win at all.
The Westralian secessionists are run-
ning T. A. Hartrey for Perth. In spite
of their success at the Referendum, they
have failed to convince electorates of the
surpassing merits of some of their lead-
ers, but they profess to believe that Hart-
rey, who once opposed ex-Premier
Hogan in his Victorian stronghold, will
wipe the floor with Nat. member Nairn.
It is 24 years since Labor captured Perth,
and it has put up stronger representatives
than H. E. Graham.
In S.A., as in Queensland, the Nats,
and Agrarians have formed one party,
which, while bearing another label, sup-
ports the U.A.P. There is also said to
be one Labor party now (there were four
until recently), but the merger has left a
lot of ill-feeling behind. The redistribu-
tion has deprived the State (and the
House) of a seat, Angas, and Joel Moses
Gabb has gone with it. S.A. has one
Labor member, Makin, who is a cer-
tainty in Hindmarsh, and on paper his
party ought to gain a seat or two, per-
haps Grey and Adelaide. Both have
been A.L.P. electorates most of the time.
But two Independent Labs, are out for
Adelaide against the “selected” K. E.
Bardolph, an impenitent Langster, be-
sides a Douglas Credit man and an Inde-
pendent Lib., so there is good hope
for Stacey, the sitting member.
Tas. Labor, which flirted with Lang-
ism till the leaders decided before the
, State elections that it wouldn’t do, is
supporting the ex-Labor and ex-Nat.
Laird Smith, now a convert to Douglas
Credit, against Lyons in Wilmot.
Another Douglasite is risking a deposit.
Neither need cause the Prime Minister a
moment’s anxiety. But one of his Min-
isters, Guy, has stiff opposition in Bass
(Launceston), and the same is true of
Blacklow in Franklin and of Hutchin
in Denison (Hobart), where there are
four Labor candidates, all endorsed, and
a Douglasite. On State-election voting
the odds are against Hutchin and also
a bit against Guy and Blacklow, who has
C. W. Frost, member in 1929-31, for a
Labor opponent; but the State Labor
Government has already contrived to
offend powerful sections, and the proba-
bilities are that State-election voting will
not be repeated.
There have been 13 general elections
for the House of Reps., and Labor has
won three ; 12 general elections for the
Senate (there was none in 1929), and
Labor has won five: its concentrated city
and country-town vote explains the dif-
ference. Hopes that the present lot of
Labor candidates for the Senate would
rival the 1903, 1910, 1913, 1914 and 1928
achievements of the party have faded.
The Queensland ticket has the best pros-
pects, though these have weakened. Since
1915, when Labor has been in power at
Brisbane Queensland has always elected
non-Labor Senators, so Crawford, Foil
and Cooper (who was not in the last Par-
liament) may go back to Canberra, though
no one would be greatly surprised if the
Labor ticket prevailed. Brand, Leckie
and Bob Elliott or Gibson will very
probably be Victoria’s choice; the fact
that Crofts is one of the Labor trio is
too unpalatable a reminder of Lang.
Johnston (C.P.) and Collett (Nat.) are
certainties in Westralia, where the State
Labor Government has made a very bad
impression by altering the Constitution
and abusing the royal prerogative to save
the seats of Labor Leg. Councillors.
There will be a lot of cross-voting in that
State and still more in N. S. Wales and
Tasmania ; and there will be heaps of in-
formal votes in all the States —far more
than ever before, because electors are
now required to vote for all the candi-
dates ; in Tas. the Labor and U.A.P.
candidates will not be grouped on the
ballot-papers.
With so many uncertain factors operat-
ing anything may happen. It will not
be surprising if both sides (U.A.P.-C.P-
and Scullin-Lang) get Senate representa-
tion in every State but Victoria.


PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Casey Commission’s Report.
The report of the Casey Commission was
delivered nearly a fortnight ago, and
since then various newspapers have pub-
lished versions. It is remarkable that, at
the time of writing, the Casey family has
not been supplied with a copy or even a
summary by the Defence Department.
Neither has The Bulletin. The Bulle-
tin has no intention of commenting
generally on the report till it comes to
hand, but there is one feature on which
the newspapers seem to be agreed—
that the Commissioner found Casey “had
been invalided in accordance with the
Regulations.” The basis of The Bulle-
tin’s original charge was that Casey had
not been invalided in accordance with
the Regulations.
The Regulations know no other way in
which a member of the R.A.N. can be
invalided than on the recommendation
of a Medical Board. Unless this for-
mality is complied with the Naval Board
has no statutory power, whatever justice
may demand on its personal desires may
be, to compensate an invalided R.A.N.
member. To quote Naval Financial
Regulations and Instructions (Chap. V:
Art. 128):
Compensation shall be assessed by the
Naval Board after consideration of the
report of the Medical Board which surveys
a member of the Permanent Naval Forces,
and recommends his invaliding.
Section 43 of the Naval Defence Act
also insists on this procedure.
Now it was admitted by all the wit-
nesses before the commission that no
Medical Board recommended the invalid-
ing of Casey. On the contrary. Casey
was invalided against the recommenda-
tions of his Medical Board: Admiral
Hyde said so in his evidence, and the
Director of Naval Medical Services
admitted in his evidence that “he knew
of no other case in which the recom-
mendations of a Medical Board had been
similarly overridden.”
In this case the Naval Board was
clearly proceeding on a principle analo-
gous to that of “the King can do no
wrong.” But, to quote Emden, the King
can do no wrong “only because he can do
nothing without advice and assistance.”
Everyone who gives the King wrong or
bad advice is not only responsible to Par-
liament but can also be called.to account
in the Courts of Justice.
Whether the Naval Board was right or
wrong medically in overriding Casey's
Medical Board is immaterial; the rele-
vant point is that, in doing so, it acted in
contravention of the Regulations. A far
more serious matter, from the standpoint
of the R.A.N., is that it thereby created a
precedent—the right of Naval Boards to
act autocratically without danger of
being called to account by Parliament or
the Courts if Naval Boards make mis-
takes.
This Impending War.
No one who has been studying recent
developments will doubt the truth of
Mr. Lang’s prophecy that war will result
if the Lyons Government is returned.
Few people, however, realise the form
it will take.
As a matter of fact, plans are already
prepared, and the first blow will be struck
with startling suddenness. Shortly after
the elections the Australia and Canberra,
accompanied by such other vessels of the
R.A.N. as can be persuaded to miss the
Melbourne Cup, will leave straightway
for Panama. If possible they are to be
equipped with real live shells, and sev-
eral detachments of the New Guard have
been sworn in for foreign service.
The war will, of. course, be a trade
war, and the objective will be Cuba. It
is no secret in financial circles that the
Cuban Revolution and the deposition of
President Machado were engineered by
the Lyons Government, working hand-in-
glove with the Queensland sugar interests.
Our cruisers have been instructed to
steam into Santiago and fire a salvo,
after which the Guardsmen will be
landed to restore order. This should
be a simple task, as the citizens of Cuba
are used to having order restored. The
students will be won over by an offer of
free scholarships to the University of
Canberra (there isn’t one, but by the
time they find that out it will be too late).
The rest of the population will doubt-
less submit without much opposition,
especially as a shipload of Christmas-
gift lambs will be sent over.
A puppet Government will be estab-
lished, with either Dr. Earle Page or Mr.
Bob Menzies as President. Its first step
will be to reduce the sugar industry to
such a state that it will no longer be a
menace to Queensland.
With Cuba under his thumb, Mr.
Lyons will proceed with his plans for
world conquest. At present the next step
is uncertain, but with Meat, Wheat and
Peanuts clamoring for assistance it is
clear that Argentina, U.S.A. and China
will have to be dealt with rather firmly.
All this will cost money, but the Gov-
ernment intends to use the accumulated
Commonwealth surpluses. When these
are exhausted it will fall back on the
accumulated State deficits, which it anti-
cipates will see the war to a successful
conclusion.
If Mr. Lang can suggest a better way
of getting rid of the deficits, let him
speak.

The Pistol Menace.
A Russian and his wife were having tea
in a room behind their Waverley (Sydney)
shop. The shop floor creaked, and the
man went to investigate. His wife heard
a shout of “Put up your hands!” Her
husband cried out, “Ring for the police! ”
A shot was fired. She rushed into the
shop to find her husband dying. The
murderer had disappeared.
Sydney is becoming used to this sort
of thing. Last year the pursuer of a
robber was shot in an industrial suburb,
and an inoffensive young householder re-
turning home from a lodge meeting was
brutally slaughtered by two thugs outside
his own gate. His assassins got off with
comparatively light sentences, the jury
having found them guilty of man-
slaughter with the illogical rider that “the
illegal and criminal use of firearms is a
most serious matter.” The trial Judge
declared that he “entirely disbelieved the
accused’s statements,” and that he “re-
garded the shooting as deliberate and cold-
blooded.” The actual slayer had said he
“didn’t know the gun was loaded.”
Three days after last week’s shooting,
a gunsmith named Carl Schultz, against
whom nothing was previously known,
was before the Brisbane Court for sell-
ing an automatic pistol (for £2 55.) to a
man afterwards charged with an armed
hold-up at Coolangatta. He said that
“he had no knowledge of the N.S.W.
law.”
It is not uncommon for people in N. S.
Wales to send to Brisbane for firearms. I
believe the man who bought the pistol was
a visitor. As I did not hand the pistol to
the man in Queensland, but posted it to
him in N. S. Wales, I was not aware I
was acting illegally.
The magistrate remarked: “It is right
that you should know the seriousness of
the offence,” and fined him £lO.
There is no need for any ordinary
man to carry a pistol, even in the
wildest parts of Australia, unless for an
unlawful purpose; or as a safeguard
against attack on specially concentrated
accumulations of wealth. It is, there-
fore, time the law was altered. It would
help considerably if firearms of the
type used by bandits were saleable only
directly through the police departments
and if anybody selling them privately
were liable to prison without the option.

A Duke’s Day.
“Billy tea,” says a paragraph issued by
the Melbourne Centenary Committee,
“will be served to H.R.H. the Duke of
Gloucester in the East Gippsland forest.”
A “bark hut or log cabin will be erected”
so that royalty may not get sunstroke
while sipping his “post-and-rail,” which
the rest of the official party will not
enjoy—they are to go to the pub.
Fortified with the Great Australian
beverage, which will indubitably be made
from the choicest tips and strained
through muslin, the tourist will hurry
to Orbost, where he will have more tea
before leaving for Bairnsdale. There he
will have a civic reception and be
allowed to board the train. After a
night’s sleep, he will go to another civic
reception before 11 a.m. After that he
will inspect the country north of Maffra:
The Duke will see both dry and irriga-
tion farms, and will inspect a selected
dairy farm and stock.
The time allowed for this performance,
including train travelling, will be one
hour. And, leaving Maffra, the Duke will
lunch on the train so that he may
hold two more receptions—one at
1.10 p.m. and another at 1.30 p.m.
Beyond four more civic shows, he will
have nothing else to do that afternoon
except cope with the members of the
State Electricity Commission.
This sort of thing is called “showing
his Royal Highness Australia.”

Financial Bodylining.
“Labor declares that there is absolutely no
hope for the farmer unless his burden of
indebtedness is removed. We will write down
all mortgage debts to a point which will enable
the people to start afresh, and which will give
them security for the future.” — W. J. Keast,
Lang candidate for Calare ( N.S.W. ).
This promise, which is being made by
all the Lang-Labor candidates, is non-
sensical. The Federal Parliament has no
power to write down mortgage debts. It
can’t even lighten the farmers’ interest
burdens directly. To quote R. Clive
Teece, K.C., a constitutional authority:
All moratorium and interest-reduction
laws have been passed by State Parlia-
ments, and no such legislation has ever
been introduced into the Federal Parlia-
ment —not even when Mr. Scullin was
Prime Minister.
The only way Labor can “write down
all mortgage debts” is by inflation on the
German scale. In the case of about three
debtors out of five, inflation, as carried
out in France eight years ago, would be
no good ; the French only brought their
monetary unit from lOd. to 2d. The
latest Lang Plan contemplates a far
bigger ramp; but it wouldn’t make new
money, credit or any other kind of valu-
able consideration: it would merely rob
one section for the benefit of another sec-
tion. The French inflation, for example,
robbed thousands of British and American
parsons, widows and the like who had
lent their savings to La Patrie on patriotic
grounds during the war. The bond-
holders wouldn’t have got so much as
2d. for lOd. if France hadn’t possessed
in Poincard a leader strong and able
enough to prevent the franc going the
way of the mark and the rouble. There
is no one of Poincare’s calibre in sight
here, so that struggling farmers who
waited long enough before paying off
their mortgages might find themselves
eventually in a position to “start afresh”
by offering their creditors a few fowls.
It happened in Germany.

Guilty of Manslaughter.
At the third trial of Mrs. Anderson for
the murder of her husband at Wagga
(N.S.W.), the jury brought in a verdict
of manslaughter. According to the
Judge,
Accused shot her husband from behind
and he was unable to defend himself.
I can only feel that the jury took a merci-
ful view. If I were asked to say whether
I knew of a worse case of manslaughter
I would have to say no.
The sentence was 20 years’ penal ser-
vitude. If the jury feels aggrieved at
the remarks from the Bench it may con-
sole itself with the reflection that two
other juries disagreed.
Before the shooting the woman was
living with her husband “in a hovel.”
The man was an invalid pensioner, hav-
ing had his skull fractured in a quarrel;
his wife had been forced into marriage
with him at 14, had had a baby a few
months later, and for nine years—she
is only 23 now —had lived in wretched
surroundings. “She has the intelligence
of a 14-year-old girl,” medical witnesses
declared. She said that on the night of
his death her husband had been drink-
ing heavily, and had hit her. She gave
different versions of the shooting, which
occurred at a water-trough near the local
out-of-works’ camp; finally she said she
heard a click and saw a rifle, grabbed
it and “didn’t know what, happened
next.” The Criminal Appeal Court is
to be asked to review the sentence.
These unhappy people were members
of a community of unemployed living on
the State under conditions not far re-
moved from savagery. It might well be
asked how many other towns in Aus-
tralia present corresponding pictures of
misery and squalor. Certainly not all the
degeneracy is to be found in the cities.
There are things hidden in country town-
ships which those who know of them
would prefer to forget. A little more con-
structive attention given to them might
save an appreciable number of slayings in
the future.

The New Electioneering.
“El V.”: This new radio electioneering
is working a revolution. Consider the
charming morsel with which Lang’s
Shakspeareans cheered a wireless half-
hour last week:
Scene: Pensioners’ Home. Two old ladies,
one unemployed man on dole and one crippled
girl agree that Lyons is a fair cow. Enter
proprietress of home, who abuses them all in
true capitalist fashion. Everyone then agrees
once more that Lyons is a cow, and accuses
hostess of giving them tough meat.
One old lady tells story of her life. Happy
husband, stalwart son at work. Boss sacks
husband because bank has called up his over-
draft. Son has hysterics upon hearing news,
and, with a loud shriek, becomes entangled
in a machine. Screams, ambulance hooters
and loud oaths.
Having collected compensation from the
bloated capitalist and bought a poultry farm,
husband suddenly discovers (to fowl-sound
effects in distance) that Lyons’s Pensions De-
partment will take savings when he dies to
pay for pension. The bank having foreclosed
on him in a brutal letter, he remarks loudly
that he thinks all banks are cows, and he hopes
Lang will wipe them out. He then dies with
pious objurgations. Old Jady concludes story
m tears. Her audience agrees that Lyons is
a cow.
Crippled girl now tells life story. She has
had a youth of oppression and hardship, and
eventually gets run over by a ’bus while she
is jumping off another one in order not to be
late lor work. (The brutal capitalist sacks
his hands if they are a moment late.)
Crippled girl spends a year in bed and loses
Her .lover. Senator James Patrick Digger Dunn
( by deed poll) forces the brutal
Lyons Government to give her a pension.
Keeper of the pensions-house tyrannises over
her slaves. Unemployed worker gets a job
in. a butcher’s shop, and proposes to marry
crippled girl. Cast at intervals abuses the
Lyons Government and the banks. It ends
by praying for the return of Lang.
While I could find a use for a mature
tomato occasionally, I like this new tech-
nique. When Lyons presents plays
written round tin-hare deals, and Earle
Page puts on slapstick comedy in which
yokels pelt Lang, the gentleman-farmer,
with carrots, even we told-timers will feel
that the transition period in electioneer-
ing is over.
Locusts Without Honey.
“El V.”: The grasshopper has made
himself felt in Australia this year. He
has rolled over inland districts in
clouds; and we have not seen the
end of him. He is, I judge, a brother to
the same pest who makes himself a first-
class nuisance in America, Asia and
Africa. I have seen brother come down
in a dark cloud in the Near East driving
humans indoors, stripping crops to the
last leaf and leaving villages starving.
Trap him by the hundredweight in pits
and his younger generations arrive in
tens of cohorts and swallow the growth
which his corpse fertilises. His myriads
literally obscure the sun, and, when he is
coming up on a high wind, driving a
motor-car among his armies is like meet-
ing a hailstorm square on.
There is a suspicion that the grass-
hopper did more to destroy Babylon and
Assyria than any climatic influence, and
his work in West Asia and Africa has
become so extensive that ah international
locust conference meets this month in
London to plan international action
against him. Already a British com-
mittee appointed by the Government has
been at work for five years, but it has
been found that no action by any single
country is likely to be efficient.
Methods of locust war have been
modernised in the last decade. Flies and
chalcid wasps have wrought great de-
struction in the grasshopper ranks, both
in Australia and America, but the per-
fect method of attack has yet to be de-
vised. Possibly it may be gas blankets
laid by aeroplanes, which have been tried
successfully in parts of the U.S.A. Aus-
tralia should certainly develop a tech-
nique.
♦
Youth’s Chances.
Among a dark forest of reprobation, it
is pleasant to see one tall tree shading
modern youth from its traducers. Dr.
Wand, the newly-arrived Archbishop of
Brisbane, “does not intend to listen to
doleful utterances about the degenera-
tion of the human race.” The youth of
England, he declares, on evidence gained
during his tenure as a don at Oxford, is
sound and improving, and “I commend
the attitude of the young people of to-
day who find their own solutions and
do not act simply upon the authority of
their elders.” He is convinced that the
youngsters of the Oxford Union who de-
clared their .intention not to fight for
King and country would fight to the last
if it came to a pinch.
His Grace would scarcely make an
acceptable member of the Melbourne
University Professorial Board. As editor
of the Melbourne “Argus,” which re-
cently had hysterics over some small in-
discretions by a college magazine, he
would be a complete failure.
There are other people in Australia
who see the possibilities of youth, but
mostly from the wrong angle. Though
employment is better than it was a couple
of years ago, no one appears to have any
comfort for the adolescent youngster
other than that contained in windy
phrases.
Before the war a boy with a high-
school education looked upon a job as
almost a natural heritage. To-day he
looks on it almost as a prize in a lottery.
Public services are nearly static in the
younger ranks ; mercantile houses fill the
spaces behind their counters with young
university graduates. Yet the mills of
high-school education grind on, turning
out floods of lads who know no trade
and girls whose only ambition is to sit
o\ er a keyboard.
If ever there was a chance to make
over the secondary State-school system
along practical lines, and divert a lot of
good material into artisan training, it is
in the present age of reconstruction.

"AND IT'S PRINTED WITH WIMBLE'S INKS"
“D.E.”: As a contributor to “Terewth”
in John Norton’s time, I followed with
interest the struggles of Ben Shashoua to
get as much of John’s money as he
could lay his paws on. Now I read that
the British Government has rounded off
the story, which is not pretty, by order-
ing Mr. Shashoua to go back to Iraq,
having decided that his room is pre-
ferable to his company. In imagination
I see the coffee-colored gentleman fish-
ing moodily from a Tigris gufa, or saun-
tering in a melancholy fashion about the
bazaars, pausing awhile to muse on the
days when the literary studies of honest
Australians furnished him with the means
of doing the grand in London, and to
curse his folly in not taking out natural-
isation papers. Only the pen of the
father-in-law he never saw could do
justice to the situation. Oh for an ppen
Letter to Bagdad Ben!

“Bethune”: A lawyer is usually ex-
pected to take legal steps to secure
redress for wrongs, real or imagined.
Miss Patricia Hackett, of Adelaide,
apparently believes more in direct action.
Founder of the Torch Theatre, she pro-
duced Silberer’s “Caprice,” and the
“What are you doing? A true artist would be too enthralled with the beauty
of his subject to need a pipe!”
“Advertiser” came out with a review in
which it said that “Caprice” “failed to
arouse any great enthusiasm, due perhaps
as much to weakness in the play itself
as to its interpretation”; for the rest,
“Miss Patricia Hackett was not happily
cast as the leading woman.” The fol-
lowing day Miss Hackett called at Par-
liament House, asked for the reporter
blamed for the criticism and threw a
bottle of ink at him. The young lady’s
version is that she didn't throw the
bottle, but merely the ink, her intention
being to pay the reporter .flack in his
own coin. And maybe she couldn’t
really have thrown the bottle at him,
seeing that it hit him.
“D.E.”: It is queer to find Patricia
Hacked so sensitive to newspaper criti-
cism, for her father was a newspaper-
man. He was John Winthrop Hacked,
editor of the “West Australian” for many
years and founder of the Perth Univer-
sity, to which he left the greater part of
his considerable estate. When quite an
old man he married a pretty girl of 18 —
Deborah Drake-Brockman, sister of the
Arbitration Judge and daughter of the
heroine of a famous bit of life-saving.
There were four children of the union,
all clever.
“M.S.D.”: Some people are
curiously conscientious. A
N.S.W. school-teacher had a
suit of clothes stolen from his
house. Among other things in
the pockets, including bank-
notes, was a cheque marked
“not negotiable.” Next morn-
ing the cheque came back by
post. I had a similar experi-
ence in Pretoria Club just after
the Boer War. Going into
dinner, I left an expensive and
new “British warm” hanging in
the hall; returning, I found in
its place a deplorable, moth-
eaten garment. In the pockets
of the new coat were several
documents bearing the heading
of the Government department
in which I was then employed.
Next morning the Zulu postboy handed
me an envelope containing the documents
intact. The coat 1 never saw again.

“Enigma”: Anyone who can assist the
police of three States to establish the
identity of a young woman murdered at
Albury, or taken there after the crime
was committed, would remove many
furrows from their brows. She was a
good-looking young woman, and was
found in pyjamas of Oriental design.
Her fingernails were painted and rose-
tinted. She had been cut about the head
with something sharp and heavy, and
someone had bundled the body under a
culvert (the evidence suggests it was car-
ried there in a car), saturated it and some
canvas wrapping with kerosene, and
attempted to burn it. Though exhaustive
inquiries have been made in N. S. Wales,
Vic. and South Aus., including a survey
of scores of "missing-girl reports and
several hundred statements from toik
who supposed the murdered woman
might be a relative or friend, the corpse
has not been identified. Detailed descrip-
tions of the girl’s garb and appearance,
including the fact that her hair appeared
to have been bleached or dyed at some
time, and a schedule of dental work that
had been done to her mouth have been
published by the newspapers on all sides
of the Murray, and a photograph has
been widely circulated, but no soul comes
forward with even a vestige of a clue to
"What’s up with the old geezer?”
“He says he can’t stand this conventional stuff—he’s one of the younger school.”

she was a stranger to Australia or
several people, not one only, have the
best of reasons for not communicating
what they know about her to the police.

“R.G.V.”: A Vic. cow-farmer asked
me to help “him with his income-tax re-
turn. Our worst difficulty was with the
Live Stock column, wherein number,
natural increase, sales and values are
stated. He carefully valued each cow
and named them all. Followed the De-
ductions. “Fifty pounds for wife,” I
said. “Fifty?” Mr. Butterfat replied—
“that won’t do. I wouldn’t take a hun-
dred for her.”

“Medic”: A Macquarie-street skin
specialist told Sydney “Sun” last week
that “a leper would be no
more dangerous walking
about the streets of Sydney
than a consumptive.” And
not half so dangerous, he
might have added, as some
v.d. sufferers. Humanity has
a tragic habit of combating
the wrong things. Pacifist
societies and anti-war leagues
flourish everywhere, and
young men are always ready
to pledge themselves not to
enlist in the next war. Few
bother about the next revolu-
tion, though revolution, as a
rule, is far more horrible
than war. In N. S. Wales 50
different schemes have been
evolved for coping with the
shark menace; hardly any-
body is interested in schemes
to diminish car-casualties,
though cars kill and maim
more people in the course of
any one year in N. S. Wales
than sharks have in all the
years since surfing began. It’s only a
half-truth to say that man is a thinking
animal.

“Schnorrer”: The Jewish Aid Society,
started by tobacco-man Blashki in
Melbourne —Aaron Blashki, his son,
launched another in Sydney—has helped
two men to become millionaires. The
late Sidney Myer sought aid from it
when he first went on the road with a
bagful of goods; so did the original
Slutzkin—each was assisted with a small
loan without interest. Slutzkin hawked
a stock of women’s undergarments, and
when he had saved a little money started
a small factory to make them; the small
factory burgeoned into big ones and a
great Flinders-lane warehouse. Myer’s
bag expanded into a business with
£2,500,000 of capital and 5300 em-
ployees. The society has had virtually
no losses ; and although it never asks
interest it indirectly receives compound
interest in substantial donations.
“Aileron”: It has been stated that
there is no record of an aeroplane
ever having been struck by lightning. A
passenger ’plane from Paris to London
has been struck while gliding over the
Channel. The wireless was blown out,
the pilot was scorched and his clothing
was set on fire. He beat out the flames
and carried on, landing at London. Save
for a terrifying bang, the passengers
knew nothing about it until their badly-
shaken steersman climbed out of his
cabin at the aerodrome. Apropos, The
Bulletin’s James Edmond, who did a
lot of air travelling in his latter years,
and never made a loose assertion on that
or any other subject, was convinced that
the lost Southern Cloud was, as he put
it, “struck by lightning at a great height.”

“Jeames”: From the “Labor Daily”:
The world-famous juggler Paul Gas-
coigne was knocked down and killed by
a motor-car on San Francisco Beach.
Gascoigne, who was born in Australia,
claimed to be the son of Lord Cecil
Gascoigne.
There is no “Lord Cecil Gascoigne,” and
there never was any such person. Gas-
coigne-Cecil is the family name of the
Marquess of Salisbury, and deceased, no
doubt, took it over and mixed it up in
the process. It is a common trick in Aus-
tralia, M.L. and the U.S.A., where
heraldry is placed in the same category
as spats. I employed a jobbing gardener
named Morton who hated work. His
wife excused him: “He wasn’t born to
it.” “What do you mean?” “He’s a
Morton —a member of the Earl of Mor-
ton’s family.” It would have been no
good telling the deluded woman that it
he belonged to this family his name
would be Douglas. She wouldn’t have
understood. In many cases where people
living outside the U.K. have distinguished
surnames they claim to be lineal descen-
dants of the original celebrity. A Syd-
ney acquaintance mentioned that he was
a descendant of the eighteenth-centur>
statesman whose fairly common name he
bore. I objected that the great man had
left no descendants, legitimate or other-

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
She lacks for intelligence maybe, behaves like
a savage at “sales,”
And dabbles in gross superstitions despised of
superior males.
She knows not a thing about schedules or
work on a definite plan;
But when she sets out for the altar she mostly
. arrives with a man.
You may jest of your idle flirtations or boast
of the hearts you have broke;
You’ll discover how small is your knowledge
of the way of a girl with a bloke.
She’s singled you out for her quarry—and try
to escape, if you can,
The damsel got up in her warpaint, the
woman who’s out for a man!
She’ll meet you by chance in the daytime when
hot, as it were, on the chase;
She’ll meet you by choice in the moonlight—
and then, as a rule, it’s a “case.”
When you falter and kiss her you’re “settled.”
It wouldn’t avail if you ran:
She’d follow you, sonny, and bag you —the
woman who’s out for a man.
Yes, when they go out on the warpath they
always .come back with a man.

who was charged with having put a
bogus advertisement in the “Births, Mar-

whether the writer in the “Australian

me on one of my visits to the hospital
at one of our Queensland abo. settle-
ments he would soon realise that Binghi

shaves and haircuts it is pronounced.

hefty old bird ; the gold in the scales

my own when Resident at Bumblepore
many years ago. The Maharajah was
an immensely fat man and avaricious.
The time for a distribution like that de-
scribed was approaching, and he ap-
pealed to me for assistance. The State
finances were in a bad state in spite of
the vast hoarded wealth in the palace
cellars, and it wds my official duty to
see that as little money as possible was
wasted. I put him on a regimen of
aperients, 10-mile runs round the palace
gardens before breakfast and bending
exercises; on the great day I had him
down to lOst. 101 b. But someone gave
the show away—the infernal anderun, of
course. When the assembled populace
in the city square saw what a small
amount of gold their ruler pulled down
they made for me with one accord, to
the accompaniment of expressions my
typewriter would blush to record. For-
tunately my training runs with H.H. had
stood me in good stead, and I beat my
fastest pursuer to the border of the next
native State by a good half-mile.

“Pineneedle”: Considerable clothing
was worn by cancan dancers, says
“Vieux Marcheur” (B. 29/8/’34). Come,
come! I first witnessed the cancan when
a lad on leave in Cairo. All the clothing
all the ladies wore could have been
packed in a pound chocolate box. But
it was a dull show —not nearly as amus-
ing as a version given by our regimental
wag in Moascar detail camp, who was
garbed, spurred and well oiled.

“El V.”: The sound of departed Vic-
torians turning over in their graves was
heard when Brisbane’s new Anglican
Archbishop remarked that he did not
disapprove of Sunday sport provided it
did not interfere with religious observ-
ances. A co-religionist shouted that “the
best thing his Grace can do is to pack
up and return home.” Another called
for “the heartiest possible protest.” The
Governor rushed to the support of the
Archbishop, but doubtless found him un-
perturbed. Both come from an England in
which the problem of making congrega-
tions spend their Sabbaths in church in-
stead of in chars-a-bancs has proved too
much for the clergy. The opposition
to Sunday sport came in with Puritanism.
In the Middle Ages Church showed no
objection so long as it fell within the
ecclesiastical laws and those of the realm,
and State encouraged the drawing of the
bow between services. The Tudors toler-
ated it. It remained for the Puritans to
impose a ban, in stern fidelity to the Old
Testament, which Dean Inge now pro-
nounces to have “little religious value.”
* * * *
“Bill O’C.”: Long ago I saw a post-
card that beat “S.T.S.’s” letter (B.
29 /8 / ’34) for unnecessary adventure.
The sender, in Tasmania, addressed it to
“Burnside, S.A.” A sorter who should
have known better sent it off to South
Africa. There it travelled all the British
colonies and Boer republics of that time
and, being stamped by all in turn as not
for any Burnside known to them, nor for
any place for which it might have been
mistaken, it was passed on to South
America. It went the grand tour
of the Latin republics, finally reaching
the addressee through a “last-chance”
Spigotty endorsement: “Try South Aus-
tralia.” It was so smothered with postal
directions and repudiations that only
“Forgive me—l was mad when I tried to kiss you—I—I could net kelp myself.”
“Well, you had a dashed good try.”
after some trouble could the message
that caused all this labor and search on
three continents be deciphered: “Thanks
for the music.”

“F.S.”: Director Bernard Hall, buying
for the Felton Bequest in Europe, has
stumbled on a bit of Captain Cook
history in the gardens of the Chateau
de Mereville, Seine-et-Oise—a bust,
erected to the navigator in his lifetime.
It stands on a white marble pyramid en-
closed in a high temple and was executed
by Pajou, a Parisian sculptor of some
note in Louis XVL’s reign. Its thrifty
owners ask £12,500 for the piece, but
Hall thinks he can close the deal for
something under £2OOO.
“Ibn el Issar”: When
the Indian Legislative As-
sembly passed an Act pro-
hibiting child marriage,
it did so almost unani-
mously, Hindu and Mos-
lem voting side by side
with the British. The great
mass of the common
people ignores the law
even where it has heard of
it. Where the Act is not
openly defied a favorite
method of evasion is to
make a pilgrimage to
some shrine in the tiny
patches of Indian territory
still held by French or
Portuguese. There are six
of these: French Pondi-
cherry and Kaikkal on the
east coast, and Mahe on
the west; Portuguese Goa,
Daman and Diu, all on
the west. In these tiny ter-
ritories, the Indian Act
does not apply, and a fee
of 15 rupees ensures a
permit to marry brides
from five years upwards.
“Sinnik”: The cables say that Sir
Henry Wood, the musician, after being
slated by the critics as a composer, “dis-
covered” one “Paul Klenovsky,” a Rus-
sian, and produced an orchestral tran-
scription of Bach’s Toccata and Fugue
in D Minor which was alleged to be
by the young genius. The critics identi-
fied Klenovsky as “one of the masters
of orchestration,” and deplored his early
death. That was five years ago, and we
are now told that “Klenovsky” was
Wood. It is one of the oldest of hoaxes,
and it never fails to come off in music,
painting and other mediums which are
criticised by amateurs for amateurs. Art
critics in Paris have been had over and
over again on similar lines. In most
communities the only people who realise
the incompetence of nine-tenths of the
art and musical critics are the artists and
musicians, and, for obvious reasons, no
one listens to them. If Mailey, say (in
emulation of the Parisian artist who won
praise for effects that had been pro-
duced by letting a donkey swish a canvas
with its tail), tried to force a dud
cricketer on Australia as a coming Brad-
man, the cricket critics wouldn’t be
taken in for five seconds after they had
. seen the new man in action. Sport
critics have to know : their readers know.
* * * *
“Spare Apollo”: Cronulla,, a Sydney
seaside suburb, has burst into contro-
versy over the decency or otherwise of
female bathing costumes. Cronulla con-
siders itself exclusive (incidentally, it
boasts the only dipsomaniacal dog in
captivity), and it looks down on the
hussies of Bondi and Coogee, and will
have none of them. A contributor to
the argument said he had been at Nice
and had there watched with horror
people dressing and undressing in the
open, “apparently unnoticed by the other
bathers.” To me this is a healthy-
minded state of things: if a man or
woman strips in public on such occasions
without anyone even bothering to turn
a head to look it argues complete eradi-
cation of that morbid sex curiosity which
is the curse of wowser-ridden communi-
ties. One finds the sarnie healthy spirit
in many of the South Sea Islands, where
the possession or lack of clout or calico
doesn’t matter a tinker’s malediction to
anyone; finds it also on Australian
beaches. In fact, outside Cronulla and
one or two Melbourne watering-places,
few care a dump what Sissie wears or
doesn’t wear.

“C. Coral”: Apart from the “mahog-
any ship” (B. 8/8/’34), two old wrecks of
special interest in Victoria’s centenary
year lie near Warrnambool. One is the
schooner Thistle, a craft of 64 tons,
which helped in the earliest settlement
of the colony. The Hentys came in
her from Launceston in 1834, and the
ship was wrecked three years later off
Port Fairy. The other one is the Enter-
prise (67 tons), which foundered off
Warrnambool in 1850. She was J. P.
Fawkner’s ship, and was the first to
ascend the Yarra, landing her cargo on
the river bank. A portion of her timbers
and six feet of rigging-chain are pre-
served in the local museum.
A ROSEBUD.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Wherever roses bloom, there is a thorn;
Wherever roses blow, there lovers are.
And so I cast upon your window-sill
A creamy bud, as dainty as your throat.
If you should wake at dawn and draw the
blind,
Oh, will you guess what hot hand laid it
there
Before his feet turned to the dusty road
1 hat draws him ever from his heart’s desire?

POLITICAL POINTS
The U.A.P. got a splendid Common-
wealth-election advertisement out of the
Nunawading by-election, and owes it all
to “the open go.” Had it restricted the
field, according to custom, it would be
unable to point out that it beat the other
side by upwards of three to one —or, of
course, that the Labor man failed to
reach the final count.
The sharemarket is a good election
barometer. Australian Consols, which
slumped a few weeks ago, have firmed
appreciably, notwithstanding the fall in
the price of wool.
By 19 to 4 the Westralian Leg. Coun-
cil has condemned the granting of a free
pardon to Gray, the Labor M.L.C. who
was fined £2O by the Fremantle magi-
strate for flinging mud at a candidate
during the Leg. Council elections, an
offence that involved forfeiture of his
seat. There is a remote possibility of the
Government’s being forced to go to the
country; if it were, it would be licked.
An answer to a question in Queens-
land Parliament shows how heavily
“transport-regulation” taxes sit on com-
petitors with the Government railways.
One owner of a single heavy vehicle
pays £367 a year.
Lang’s preface to the “Labor Year-
Book” is titled “The Future Belongs to
Youth.” The young campaign director
(he is just on 58) might have dedicated
his sage remarks to that other rising hope
of the Youth movement Arthur Rae
(rising 75), and to the most recent addi-
tions to the Caucus, Jack Sweeney (66)
and Bill Brennan (69).
With 57 candidates standing, 332,980
informal votes were cast at the Senate
elections three years ago, although it was
unnecessary to vote for more than seven
candidates. Now, with nine more' in the
field, electors will have to vote for the
lot, and the number of spoilt ballot-
papers may reach half a million. This is
worrying all the parties; and with so
many Independents about and people
chary of opening their hearts to canvas-
sers, they may all suffer shocks in the
elections for both Chambers.
Tas. Labor is bringing in a bill making
hotel hours 10 a.m. to 10 p.m., instead
of 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. Extension beyond
6 p.m. is warranted, especially as the
cruising steamer has introduced a new
form of competition with pubs catering
for the tripper; but the prohibitionists
are shouting that they have been sold.
Certainly the proposed reform was never
mentioned in Labor platform or policy
speech.
Lang must think a lot of Crofts, one of
the Vic. Labor candidates for the Senate.
His newspaper’s “Year-Book,” to which
he contributes a foreword, has a “Who’s
Who in Labor” at the end, and Crofts is
in it. The distinction is denied to fellow-
candidates Barnes and Moloney; also to
Scullin, Brennan, Blackburn, Holloway,
Dr. Maloney and the rest of the Scullin-
Labor candidates in Victoria —all except
Crofts. It is to be hoped that Crofts has
a proper sense of gratitude.
Scullin-Labor’s State executive made
N.S.W. Labor history by dispensing with
a selection ballot in Martin and putting
up two Diggers, McCallum and Mc-
Dicken. It will be desperately hard for
either to wrest the seat from the U.A.P.,
but both are above the average. McCal-
lum spoke to the Sydney Constitutional
Association the other day—a rare com-
pliment. McDicken was M.L.A. for
Ryde and Concord ; then he fell under
Lang’s displeasure.
The name of Jarvie, State member for
Ashfield (N.S.W.), has been mentioned at
one of the inquiries (two are in progress
and others are proposed) into the opera-
tions of the gentlemen from Maoriland
who specialised in forming “investment-
trust” companies ; and presumably it will
go on the list of witnesses. Seemingly
unlucky in his choice of business asso-
ciates, Jarvie resigned his seat and con-
tested a by-election in 1929. When
Bavin retired he aspired to the leadership
of his party, but support was lacking.
“The jacaranda has been in bloom”
in Brisbane, as they say there when a
row breaks out in the State Parliament.
One member accused another of having
distributed “free booze and free money”
during the East Toowoomba by-election.
Encouraged, as it were, by an interjec-
tion, he asked the Speaker to keep the
other gentleman in order, adding kindly:
He could not be kept in order in Too-
woomba. Even three compatriots could
not hold him up.
“You bankrupts only pay 12s. in the
pound! ” the other gentleman retorted ;
and then there were shouts of “Liar!”
“One Nulty, speaking at Leeton, described Beasley as ‘the Abraham Lincoln of Australia,’
and said he was ‘typical of that great American statesman in nearly all regards.’ ”
“So an admirer thinks you’re like me. But I said, ‘You can’t fool all the people
all the time’ ; you think you can.”
A horrified Speaker pacified the gentle-
men, and the House went on with its
work.
Indi is witnessing one of the most in-
teresting election fights. It is not nor-
mally a Labor constituency, but Paul
Jones, who has nothing of the corsair
in his composition, became its member
in 1928 (because Bob Cook was late with
his nomination paper), and held it in
1929, only to lose it last time. He has
since been secretary to the tobacco-
growers, who are not pleased with Lyons
and co., so Hutchinson, the U.A.P. mem-
ber, will have a job to get back. Cook
was C.P. The C.P. vote is not what it
was, though strong enough to give Dr.
Davies a fighting chance.
Mr. Baddellay has hurled himself into
the election mellay. At Muswellbrook
he said:
“Labor” will banish all your worries by
writing off your debts or mortgages he|d by
the private banking institutions.
If “Labor” did the banks would go bung,
and in their fall they would bring down
insurance and friendly societies, co-op.
concerns and coalmines; indeed, Mr.
Baddellay’s constituents might have to
take the worst of the buffets. But pos-
sibly Mr. Baddellay’s carcass would be
safe.
Odd persons with odd names are look-
ing after Roosevelt’s national-recovery
programme —Professor Tugwell, Profes-
sor Moley, Mr. Richberg, Miss Perkins
and Mr. Swope. Americans glumly com-
plain that they are a cocksure lot, but
nobody could be as cocksure as their
leader, “General” Johnson. Writing the
history of his industrial codes for the
“Saturday Evening Post,” the general
said:
Code No. 1 was the cotton textile code.
Its negotiation was not difficult because
the ground had been prepared. All of the
problems [of the industry] were solved by
the code.
That was on July 14. Just six weeks
later the strike broke out. So far, about
a hundred unionist objectors to the code
that solved all the problems have been
shot.
People are very apt to believe what
they wish to believe, and all over the
world the conviction has taken root that
private manufacturers of armaments are
to blame for wars. There is a case
against them, of course, but where the
will-to-war exists there will be fighting,
whether armaments are manufactured in
Government or privately-owned fac-
tories. A U.S. Senate committee is try-
ing to probe the operations of interna-
tional armaments-makers, and some
plausible evidence has been given. But a
witness had the front to state, as positive
fact, that King George had intervened, in
the interest of the Vickers concern, to
prevent the sale of American-made guns
to Poland ; and now there is a feeling
that other liars have been at work in
this congenial field.
Many farmers entitled to the Common-
wealth bounty on 1933-34 wheat still
await payment in full. State Govern-
ments have the distribution of the money,
but applicants are required to produce
Federal certificates that they did not earn
taxable income, and this is a tedious pro-
cess ; it occurred to some genius at Can-
berra that farmers who did earn taxable
income should be deprived of the bounty
for being capable and energetic. For
one Government to raise money by taxa-
tion and hand it over to another to spend
is a rotten variety of finance, but Aus-
tralian politicians increasingly favor it
for various reasons. One is that wh“n
things go wrong, as they always do, each
Government can blame the other.
Needing the preferences of Scullin-
Labor candidates, and realising that their
group has regained ground in N. S.
Wales since 1931, the Lang faction is pro-
posing an exchange. Scullin-Labs. will
have none of-it. Ted Riley says he will
be dashed if he asks his supporters in
Cook to give their seconds to Garden.
Arthur Griffith (reported by J. Butler,
Narrabri) gave this positive refusal in
Gwydir:
A candidate is justified in explaining the
policy of his party, and in asking electors
who approve of it for their No. 1 votes;
but to tell them to what other candidates
they are to give their second preferences
would be an impertinence. It would
amount to treating as children a body of
electors probably quite as intelligent as him-
self and as capable of knowing what can-
didates they desire to support.
The snub direct.
Political campaigns to free debtors
from their obligations have been fought
at intervals by alleged democrats ever
since the first democratic State was
formed. Some have been backed for
tactical reasons by far bigger capitalists
than Lang. Crassus, the richest man
of the closing years of Republican Rome,
supported Catiline’s policy of debt-
repudiation, hoping to snatch the dic-
tatorship from the confusion. If Aus-
tralia gives a verdict for inflation on
September 15 it will certainly get some
kind of dictator, and it won’t be Lang,
Beasley or Scullin. They are essen-
tially talkers, and in times of crisis men
of that sort are usually pushed aside by
fighters.
Queensland Labor has been unlucky
with its experiments in paternalism at
Beerburrum. On a tobacco-growing
plan £28,328 of Government money
has been spent; out of 102 unemployed
given blocks and instructed in the mys-
teries of raising leaf only 37 remain.
A Great Labor Rally:
The “Labor Daily” said Sunday’s rally in
Moore Park, Sydney, was “great,” “spectacu-
lar,” “splendid,” and so on, but the truth is
it was one of the most dispirited affairs pn
record. Last time the “L.D.’s” boss spoke
in Moore Park an enthusiastic crowd covered
all the cricket pitches; on Sunday the pitches
were being used by proletarians who seemed
deaf to the distant howls of their would-be
saviour. The crowd round the loudspeakers
was no bigger than an average Grant or Garden
Domain crowd. Walking along Anzac-parade
about half an hour before the arrival of Lie
processionists, I noticed a familiar chin in a
limousine. The Leader was waiting for his
People—the Leader who isn’t standing for the
Parliament which he proposes to lead. He
marched proudly with his People at the
demonstration; they had let him down bao.y
at this one.

E. Lee Neil will take control of the
vast complex of interests built up by
the late Sidney Myer in Melbourne.
Neil is the present managing director.
His battle-axe visage is familiar to two
classes of citizens. He is a lay reader at
St. Paul’s and preaches there (he started
a Bible class at Myers’), and, like his late
chief, he has been seen at most big city
concerts for years past.
Kingsford Smith and his co-pilot, P.
E. Taylor, flew non-stop from Melbourne
to Perth on Saturday in a little over 10
hours. The Lockheed Altair averaged
175 rn.p.h. against a 25 m.p.h. head wind.
As Kingsford Smith and his colleague,
besides being super-fliers, know the
course as a policeman knows his beat,
they look like being hot favorites for the
centenary event. If they win, two air
forces will share in their triumph. Kings-
ford Smith was, of course, a Digger, but
Taylor, though a Sydneyite, won his
M.C. in the R.A.F.
“C.Q.”: The identity of Brent of Bin
Bin, the author of “Up the Country” and
“Ten Creeks Run,” has been revealed.
When the first book was highly praised
in The Bulletin years ago, speculation
began as to who the writer was, and
letters c/o the publishers brought some
charming replies but no evidence. The
WILL LAWSON, traveller and writer.
writer was obviously a woman, and pro-
bably Stella Miles Franklin, who gave
Australia “My Brilliant Career.” So said
most of the critics, and they prove to
have been right.
“Goldie” (otherwise Major P. Golden-
stedt) is having a tough fight in
the U.A.P. interest against Arthur
Blakeley in Darling (N.S.W.). He should
get a lot of returned soldiers’ votes on
Saturday. He has long been a person-
ality in R.S.L. matters, and as a journalist
he has always battled for the Digger.
“Goldie” behaved valorously on the Pen-
insula, and was given his commission after
Lone Pine. He transferred to the
Camel Corps later, and at the finish of the
war became Administrator of a captured
Turkish province.
One of the leaders of Melbourne
Jewry is Dr. Patkin. Few have had
such a stirring career. He was a law
student in Moscow when the revolution
of 1905 occurred, and he soon saw the
inside of a Czarist gaol. He thought
Russia’s troubles were over with the rise
of Kerensky in 1917, but the Bolshevik
success sent him back to his old gaol—
this time for 16 months. Patkin is now
an Australian manufacturer. An old
friend of Stanislavski, of the Moscow Art
Theatre, he has introduced some interest-
ing Russian plays to Melbourne
amateurs.
From Melbourne:
"The late Sidney Myer, inventor of the
slogan “Content with achievement is the first
sign of decay,” was born 56 years ago at
Vilna, then Russian. He went to Hamburg at
the- age of 19, thence to Melbourne (where he
wrapped parcels for an uncle), and thence
to Bendigo, where he first hawked bootlaces
and the like, and then bought into a business.
His next venture was to mop up Wright and
Neil in Bourke-strect and change the name.
The Myer Emporium grew and grew until
its authorised capital was nearly £3,000,000.
Myer was the first businessman in Victoria
to establish medical and nursing facilities for
his employees and to build sanatoria for them
in the hills. He began giving most of his profits
away years ago; £50,000 went to the univer-
sity alone. Later he subsidised Sunday after-
noon orchestral concerts in the Domain, and
in 1930 he staged the most enormous Christ-
mas dinner ever seen in the metropolis, when
11,000 poor families were given a spread at
the Exhibition Building. His centenary gifts
ran into thousands. An eager, voluble little
man, he didn’t look like a captain of industry
or anything else at first sight. His gifts were
nerve and capacity to live and work with
furious enexgy in the present, while seeing ten
years or so into the future.
Will Lawson, here
portrayed by Frith,
has been appointed
official representa-
tive in Australia of
the Agents’ Official
Steamship Guide.
In this capacity he
will give informa-
tion about any pas-
senger steamship
line in the world.
He has travelled
all over the U.S.A.
and Maoriland ; he
has visited Manila,
Japan and Singa-
pore, and, of
course, he knows
all about Australia.
When not travel-
ling he writes —
chiefly stories and
verses about the
sea. He was a
Bulletin contribu-
tor years before he
became shipping
reporter of Sydney
“Evening News”
under E. G. Knox’s
editorship.
“Bowyan g”:
Here’s a true story
of Edgeworth
David, which all
who knew the un-
pretentious o 1 d
boy will recognise
as typical. He and his wife used to go
occasionally to a place he owned in the
Blue Mountains. Near by was a cottage.
The cottage had a new tenant and the
Davids’ garden had yielded a surplus of
vegetables. At his wife’s suggestion David
loaded himself up with an armful to
present to his neighbor. As he neared
the front door a female voice shouted
fiercely “Go round the back.” Where-
upon the complaisant scientist duly de-
livered his load at the back door.
Dr. S. H. Nicholson, the musician,
bears a striking resemblance to Sir
Hamilton Harty, and he belongs to the
same school of art. Formerly organist
at Westminster Abbey, in which capacity
he played both Princess Mary and the
Duke of York to the nuptial fount, he
is director of the English School of
Church Music. As the guest of the C.
of E. authorities, he wants to improve
the local standard of selection of what
one critic has described as “our melan-
choly hymnal.” Briefly, it is his ambition
to heave out Anglicanism’s bad hymns
and improve its music.
Herewith Paul
Staal, Consul-Gen-
eral in Australia
for the Nether-
lands, as Finey
sees him. He has
represented hi s
country at Singa-
pore, Penang, Tan-
gier, Pretoria,
Kobe, New York
and Smyrna, also
at Bombay and
Calcutta. Jonathan
Cape recently pub-
lished a book by
him, “A Foreigner
Looks at India.”
His Sydney job
gives him juris-
diction over mat-
ters Dutch in
such out-of-the-
way places as
Tonga and the Gil-
bert and Ellice
islands. At 53 he
still retains an in-
terest in cycling,
though golf and
bridge are taking
up more and more
of his spare time.
Though she is
almost three score
and ten, Evange-
line Booth has be-
come General of
the Army which
her father founded.
In London she
braved the worst
of the hostile mob
element in the early
days of the Army
(Marylebone was
her sector), and for the past 30
years she has been in charge in the
U.S.A. She will get £5OO a year,
which comes from a trust fund
created in the lifetime of the first Booth
(there is no salary attached to the office
other than this), and presumably her
home will be the beautiful Thames-side
place admirers gave her father. Though
the Army, by this gesture, returns to
the “old firm,” the breach between it
and the widow and family of Bramwell
Booth is still as wide as ever. Evan-
geline was amongst those who ranged
themselves against Bramwell when the
great schism occurred.
Glen Innes (N.S.W.) has said good-
bye to a Presbyterian minister, the Rev.
A. P. Cameron, who has been preaching
to it for 32 years out of his 41 as a
parson. The charge (which then in-
cluded Inverell and Wellingrove) was
first taken over by his father in 1854. The
retiring minister, who was State Mod-
erator in 1929, is going on the land in

George E. Kitchin Kerr, Melbourne
market manager for the Federal Citrus
Council, possesses one of the oddest testi-
monials on record. He got it from the
Bagdad Railway Construction Company,
which employed him after he had been
taken prisoner on Gallipoli.
We certify that Mr. G. E. Kerr,
prisoner of war, was on the staff of the
central stores at Belemedik (Anatolia)
from February 5, 1916, until November
14, 1918, beginning as invoice clerk, and
then as head clerk. In this last capacity
Mr. Kerr was responsible for the whole
accountancy dealing with payment
anc j v j c t ua jji n g D f the workmen. In the
exercise of his duties he displayed out-
standing ability and absolute trustworthi-
ness. He leaves our service owing to the
Carlton

PAUL STAAL, Dutch Consul-General.
W. G. Scarvell, the new editor or
Sydney “Freeman’s Journal,” Australia’s
oldest R.C. weekly, began, like many an-
other Australian editor, with legal aspira-
tions. Then he drifted into journalism,
and was for 10 years on the “S. M.
Herald.” He has been sub-editor of the
“Freeman’s” for the past 12 years. He
earned a Papal decoration for his work
at the last Eucharistic Congress in Syd-
ney. The Bulletin wishes him luck in
his new job: it has had a kindly feeling
for editors of the “Freeman’s” since one
of them allowed it to print its first issue
in its composing-room at the old St.
Mary’s Chapter House 54 years ago.
L. J. Morshead, the new manager of
the Melbourne branch of the Orient line,
is one of the many schoolmasters who
distinguished themselves in the A.I.F.
He was teaching at Melbourne C. of E.
Grammar when war was declared. He
left with the 2nd Battalion in T 4, and
two years later, at 26, he was C.O. the
33rd. He finished up A.A.-G. the A.I.F.
in London. Organisation is his specialty.
Sir Thomas Dunhill, honorary sur-
geon to the King, who will be a Mel-
bourne centenary visitor (visitor, not
guest), once displayed his shingle in Col-
-1 ins-street. He began bread-winning as
a chemist’s assistant in Rochester (Vic.),
and took a medical degree at Melbourne
University. He was a great worker for
the Vic. Methodist Church, and. para-
doxically, is one of Hollywood's heroes.
Two years ago he saved the life of Carl
Laemmle when the U.S.A. doctors had
given the hyphenated producer up as lost.

What the board calls profit out of the
year’s surplus was £11,734 better than
in 1929 ; the “Wild Cat” throws addi-
tions to the insurance fund (£270,000, up
£lO,OOO last term) in with admitted earn-
ings in the table, and on that basis last
year’s result is level with the showing
of five years ago. Compared with 1933,
the year’s operations enabled an extra
£23,246 to be exhibited for shareholders ;
on capital the result was 6.3 p.c. as
against 5.4, 5.1, 4.8, 7, 6.4 and 7.8 p.c.
back to 1928. An extra point on the div.
(making 6 p.c.) left the visible transfer
to reserves on the slender side ; but ship-
ping cos. generally—and the Adelaide
has been no exception in the past —usu-
ally make cautious provision below the
waterline for safety and steadiness.
The 6 p.c. div. is worth 18 p.c. to
holders of 15 years’ standing. The three-
for-one bonus of 1920 threatened to
make profit-earning hard when slump hit
coal investments as well as freight and
passenger revenue. But the co.’s coastal
and*Spencer Gulf trade has lately been
expanding encouragingly; m.-v. Man-
unda proved a sound investment, and
another 10,000-tonner, the Manoora, will
be launched in Britain next February.
Some of the older coal-burning freighters
have not been so profitable ; one was sold
last term, and two in the previous year.

The more interesting assets —steamers,
shares, Consols and deposits—are valued
together with other oddments in one item
at £3,059,743 (up £11,279). Though pro-
gress payments will presumably have
been made on the new passenger vessel,
the debt (£76,687, excluding staff fund)
was £15,986 lighter. Sundry debtors
were £4712 higher; stocks of coal, etc.,
were £3128 lower.
Coal investments are likely to be little
or no help for years. J. and A. Brown
and Abermain Seaham Collieries, Ltd.,
descendant of the old Abermain and
East Greta cos. (from which Adelaide
drew substantial divs. in better days) has
lost the Australian Gas Light Co.’s big
contract; though it captured an order
from N. S. Wales Railways for 250,000
tons, the price for large coal was only
10s. 3d. a ton. The co. contributed only
2| p.c. in its last year. Passenger and
freight earnings, however, have definitely
improved; the winter tourist trip to
Cairns has grown particularly popular.
At 275. 6d. the pound shares show 4.3
p.c. on last year’s div. basis. Net tan-
gible backing is 245. sd. on book values.

Earnings now come from the N. S.
Wales and Victorian operations of Aust.
Portland Cement Pty., in which Kandos
owns a million shares. This holding co.
sold its Consols during the year at a
profit of £B5Bl, and repaid 4s. in the £1
of its paid capital, the operation calling
for £168,466.
Net earnings for the year were put
at £40,479, £558 lower than in 1933.
That excludes the capital profit, and
probably some interest was lost on the
sale of securities. A 6 p.c. div. on the
adjusted share-register called for £1684
less than a 5 p.c. handout did in the
previous year. Reserves, mainly repre-
sented by shares in the operating co.,
figured at £350,653.
The general recovery in industry last
term is not reflected in this co.’s
accounts. That perhaps is because it is
a holding co., and only discloses as
income what the operating concern
passes along. The pup is “securing its
share of the trade available,” and “the
demand for cement... .showed steady im-
provement.” It all suggests that Kandos’s
equity in the earnings of the pup were
bigger than its disclosed profit.
Australian Portland Cement’s capital
is owned in equal shares by Australian
Cement and Kandos, which merged their
interests in 1929. The pup controls plant
with an annual capacity of around
450,000 tons, about a third of the total
plant capacity of the Commonwealth.
Kandos’s change from an operating to a
holding co. is shown in these figures:

The accounts are now very uninforma-
tive. Chief movements last year were
the reduction of capital to £673,862 and
a drop of £131,871 in cash, etc.
The impetus given to building activity by
last season’s higher wool prices is likely to
continue well into this term. In Victoria
things are particularly encouraging ; the
Government intends to erect a large
chain of silos for bulk-handling wheat.
In N. S. Wales the Government contract
for cement, which the Standard Co. has
largely enjoyed for some years, termi-
nates shortly ; Kandos now has hopes of
being a successful tenderer. The Cement
Manufacturers’ Association meantime
continues to foster the industry generally
and create new demands.
The greatest trouble in the trade is
overcapitalisation. The market, how-
ever, looks upon the 6 p.c. as being
reasonably secure, and pays 19s. 3d. for
the 16s. fully-paids. The return at that
figure is 5 p.c., and the backing 30s. sd.
in net tangibles per pound of paid capital.

"Half-year.
Shareholders still rtap a harvest of
sorrow, though with a little less conser-
vatism in stock valuation the directors
might have converted that small loss into
a small profit. The tea and grocery
departments have been a big worry. With
its other lines the co. has fallen behind in
the race, largely due to aggressive com-
petition and the swing of the shopping
centre northward and away from Flinders-
street. During the importing boom it
was a prosperous business; exchange
and the tariff hit the co. severely.
Last term gross profit (£58,518) was
£7ll lower, but exes (£60,913) were
cut back £1632 ; thus the year’s net loss
was £921 lighter. That brought the lay-
by down to £18,084, which isn’t much of
a prop for the £200,000 of ord. and
£50,000 of pref. capital. There is now
£14,000 of arrears coming to the prefs.,
equal to ss. 7d. a share.
Over the eight years to the close of
accounts in 1931, £129,812 more was
spent upon premises and plant than was
written off, and £128,940 was added to
the debt:

Fixed assets have shown little movement
of late. Most important change last
year was a reduction of £7315 in stock
values ; there has been a steady shrink-
age in this item. Book debts were £1943
lighter, and the co. was able to reduce its
outside obligations by £6200; £115,000
of the debt is on mortgage. The excess
of liabilities over liquids advanced to
£12,040 (up £3058).

Copra touched £8 a ton in London dur-
ing the year, but gross earnings (£49,376)
firmed £4022 ; the net result was £2286
better at 12 p.c. on capital, compared
with 11.3, 11.1, 12.5, 14.6 and 20 p.c.
back to 1929. The improvement seems
mainly due to merchandising and aerial-
service activities on the New Guinea
goldfields. The first two ’planes were
bought towards the end of the previous
term ; a twin-engined machine was added
to the fleet last year, and a three-year
contract for carrying mails and freight
to the goldfields has been secured from
the Government.
Most interesting recent development
was the purchase of two 9000-ton Diesel-
driven vessels to establish a direct line
with British markets. The first ship is
due in Australia in October, and five
trips to London a year are scheduled.
To finance the acquisition 115,000 un-
allotted shares were offered to share-
holders and snapped up.
Founded as an island trading concern
by the Carpenters in 1914, with its main
interests in New Guinea and the Solo-
mons, the co. continues to expand quietly
and solidly. The management has never
been talkative or over-generous with
divs., but the 8 p.c. these days, more
than double the yield of Consols, speaks
for itself. In the good years more was
visibly put by than was distributed, and
in 1932 £86,000 of what had never been
acknowledged as profit was brought to
light. This was “over and above ample
provision for contingencies.”
Of the visible reserves (£240,073) in
the table, £28,075 is earmarked for “re-
placements and renewals.” This offsets
the entire book value of the co.’s coastal
fleet: —

To what extent the new ships figure in
the latest balance sheet is not clear;
branch balances (£418,867, up £67,735)
is an item more elastic than specific, and
movements therein are not very signi-
ficant to outsiders. Investments (£140,618,
up £12,920) include the co.’s interest in
its Solomon Islands subsidiary, whose
£112,000 of ord. capital the parent largely
controls. The pup handed on 4 p.c.—
2 p.c. Jess than in the previous year—
reflecting more truly the position in the
copra trade.
Disclosed liabilities amount to only
£18,071, though there is probably some
debt amongst branch balances. Visible
backing for the shares is 345. per £1 of
paid capital. The fully-paids are at 40s.

Sydney share market is now interested
in the ords. as well as the prefs., and
there has been a good deal of specula-
tion in the scrip. Last year’s result dis-
appointed the optimists. Net earnings
fell away 75 p.c. over the two years to
the end of 1931 ; since then the recovery
has amounted to £13,880, £2461 of it
in respect of the past term. With trade
conditions showing all-round improve-
ment, something better was expected of
the latter period.
Only half a point was added to the
ord. distribution, making it 3i p.c. ; that
and 7f p.c. on the £lOO,OOO of pref. capi-
tal called for all but £567 of the dis-
closed earnings, leaving general reserves
still £15,585 short of the figure (£48,250)
at which patent rights appear in the
books. But there was £195,595 labelled
“specific reserves,” up £11,795 (as against
£14,436 previous year), part of which
may look after this intangible.

Most of the £530,690 of ordinary capi-

It is an item which catches the eye, and
means that turnover needs to be brisk
if satisfactory profits are to be won, even
if the book value is discounted by the
whole of the specific reserves. Debtors’
balances, after a growth of £26,387 in
the preceding year, fell away £6671. The
more or less liquid surplus (£169,673)
slipped £3771.
James Stedman began sweet-making in
the ’fifties ; Hendersons linked up much
later. There was a reconstruction in
1920, when paid capital swelled to
£530,690 ; just before the war the com-
bined capitals of the two separate con-
cerns was about a tenth of that figure.
In between the small business of Dillon,
Burroughs and Co. had been bought.
Nestles became interested, and took over
the distribution of the co.’s lines ; this
connection has been valuable. But it
was not until 1925 that the ords. came
into the picture, and then it was because
of the success of Minties. The exten-
sion of the business to Maoriland and
the cut in the price of sugar have helped
in the recovery from 1931, when the
ords. again went without.
Though the market now thinks 15s.
6d. enough for the ords.—at that figure
the yield is 4.5 p.c. on last year’s div.
basis —the first prefs. are sought after at
315., while the seconds fetch 30s. The
return is 5 p.c. and 5.2 p.c. respectively
on the minimum (7£ p.c.) div. basis. The
tangible cover (book value, excluding
specific reserves) is £l2 7s. 3d. firsts, £ll
7s. 3d. seconds, and 19s. 6d. ords.

This is the only Australian coal co.
whose scrip is valued by the investing
public at anything like par, and it is at
a discount of 30 p.c. A snug financial
position and a solid colliery asset have
put it at the head of the list, though these
days it has only a small capital. Between
1929 and 1932 shareholders were handed
back 13s. 6d. per share in cash, the co.
revealing a financial position much
stronger than the accounts had suggested,
and liquid assets in excess of the book
value of mine and plant.
Southern coal is not suitable for gas-
making, but it is an excellent steam fuel.
The colliery is well equipped and handy
to the waterfront, bunkering connections
and management are good, and labor
conditions are better than at Maitland.
The fight on the northern coalfields was
responsible ’for Bellambi’s handsome
dividends between 1927 and 1930. Since
the resumption at Newcastle there has
been a fierce price-war for railway and
similar orders.
Last term the profit exhibited was
equal to 4.5 p.c. on capital, compared
with 4.4, 2.3, 11.2 and 15.4 p.c. in the
four preceding years ; div. rate was 3.8
p.c. —unchanged.
The great money-spinning years of the
past have gone. Shipping activity, both
coastal and overseas, has slipped con-
siderably, while most new ships built are
motor-vessels or oil-burners.

tive :

Mine, railway, plant, freeholds, steamers,
stocks and investments are lumped
together at £266,472 (up £18,121). The
mixing of liquid assets with the solid
and immovable variety makes analysis
difficult. The colliery and fleet have been
well maintained, underground develop-
ment continues satisfactory, and profit
was written after providing for taxation,
depreciation and contingencies.
For the 6s. 6d. fully-paids, backed by
net tangibles to the book value of
10s. 4d., the market pays 4s. 9d. Return
at that figure is a shade under 4 p.c. on
last year’s div. basis.
Austral Malay Tin has taken a nine
months’ option over about 1000 acres of
the Cullengoral Alluvial Co.’s leases
along the flats on both sides of the Cudge-
gong River, Gulgong (N.S.W.). Tests
of Cullengoral’s other leases (not in-
cluded in the option) showed 56 fine
ounces from 3200 cubic yards. Pump
sluicing has been discontinued, the pro-
perties (250 acres) being thought more
suitable for dredging. A volume of
about 8,000,000 cubic yards in this area
is mentioned. A further 350 acres of
river-bed and adjacent flats covering the
junction of the Tammany Lead, and a
detached holding of deep-lead character,
are to be prospected. The programme
includes the flotation of two working
subsidiaries. Cullengoral’s scrip was
listed in Sydney last week. There are
24,000 vendors’ and promoters’ ords
fully paid to 45., 65,000 ords. paid to
6d., and 21,000 prefs., 6d. paid. The
market’s valuation of the contribs. is
3s. 7d. ords., prefs. 6s. 6d.

Sulphide Gold, Mandurama (N.S.W.),
appears to be moving into better country
in its old Junction Reefs property ; dur-
ing the last two weeks about 730 z. fine
gold was recovered over the plates, apart
from cyaniding. The plant has recently
been given a complete overhaul, and all
sections are now working smoothly. Six
new vats have been erected to give more
washings to the richer ore expected
shortly ; work is proceeding on the oil-
driven compressor, etc., at Sheahan’s
mine, and the co. aims to start milling
ore from this new holding towards the
end of the month. Sheahan’s property
is estimated to contain 44,000 tons of
over half-ounce ore, and around 100,000
tons showing six to seven ’weights. Co.
is also going ahead developing and
measuring up its large areas at Junction
Reefs, formerly worked by the old Lynd-
hurst Co. The alterations and additions
to plant have been facilitated by part of
the new capital put up by shareholders
a couple of months ago. The 2s. fully-
paids can be had at 3s. 6d.
* * * *
Lightning Gold, Tullamore (N.S.W.I,
reports that at a depth of 101 ft. the reef
in the new shaft measures 35 inches
wide, half showing free gold, the rest
sulphides. Until samples are assayed no
values are available. Crushing of the
dump is to start this week. Week-end
quotes for the shilling-paids were buyers
9d., sellers Is. Id.
* * * *
Alberton field (Tas.), a fairly large
gold-producer whose reefs were never
prospected to depth, is to be given an-
other chance. The Mercury had the rule
run over it by a visiting engineer, and
assay values running from 4|oz. to B|oz.
were taken from stopes over a distance
of 40ft. in the 240 ft. shaft. An option
was exercised. A syndicate, said to have
good financial backing, is also to take
into its grasp the Ringarooma United,
Forest King (formerly the Alberton) and
a couple of 50-acre sections. Late W. H.
Twelvetrees, Government Geologist, had
a good opinion of this field, and in the
last report before his death reckoned that
a goldfield would be found below the
workings of these shows, but that suc-
cess would depend largely upon the dis-
cretion with which the work was taken
in hand.
* * * *
Statements “reported officially” in
Speck papers and on the mainland that
the Tasmania at Beaconsfield has been
purchased by an English co., and that
operations will commence at once,
proved a bit premature. Negotiations
have been going on for some time, but a
three months’ extension of the option
from the leaseholders (Harvey and
Goninon) has been asked for.
* * * *
An option has been taken over Asso-
ciated Northern Blocks’s Slippery Gimlet
leases at Ora Banda (W.A.). A new
co., Associated Northern Ora Banda,
N.L., is being put off the stocks with
£150,000 worth of scrip, ss. denomina-
tions. Of this, 450,000 shares have been
offered to the public at 2s. on applica-
tion and allotment; the lot was easily
swallowed. Property was worked suc-
cessfully for some years until the Gov-
ernment utilised the co.’s water-supply
for State-battery purposes, and opera-
tions were suspended. Water should no
longer be a difficulty. The promoters
responsible for the new float also pushed
off Lake View South Extended in
Sydney recently.
* * * *
Wiluna Gold Mines, recently visited
by a Bulletin man, maintans a big gold
output, has remarkably low working
costs, and is steadily increasing its in-
trinsic value. C. E. Prior has given up
the job of general-manager to become
managing-director, with headquarters in
Perth. H. H. Carroll, formerly of
Broken Hill, succeeds him as boss on the
mine.
Surface impressions of a Bulletin
man who recently visited some old
Westralian goldmines which London
capital is raising from the dead: Dilapi-
dated poppets punctured by termites,
waterlogged shafts in advanced state. ot
disrepair, caved-in open-cuts, and rusting
machinery. Some of this plant, which
cost large sums, could hardly be sold
as old iron. Portions would not pay
to dismantle and transport elsewhere if
given away. Several of these shows
should never have been closed down.
Prospects warranted a continuance of
operations. In some cases the sponge
was thrown up because the cos. got the
huff over increased award wages.
afe * ♦
Daisy Queen, at Lawlers (W.A.), is the
latest of old Westralian failures to attract
the notice of option-seekers. Sick of ex-
pensive mining, heavy water and erratic
values, the small Adelaide co. that
formerly worked the property moved
out and moved on to another show in
the same district, which was reckoned to
be more promising and easier to work
than the one discarded. But it was out
of the frying-pan into the fire.
* * * *
Boogardie (W.A.), noted for rich
patches of gold, has another to its credit.
This time 1001 b. of stone yielded nearly
an ounce per pound. In the last six
months almost 200 oz. has been extracted
from 3001 b. of rock. Western Mining
Corp. has an option on the show.
* * * *
Marvel Loch (W.A.) has lately been
one of the best market attractions on
the Adelaide ’Change, the 2s. shares
having a lively turnover. Between
1907 and 1915 a weakly-financed co.
crushed about 50,000 tons for roughly
19,0000 z., then gave up. Recently an
Eastern concern took possession and
claims to have a real good thing.
* * * *
Increased tonnage has resulted in Lake
View and Star extending its power and
compressor plant, both jobs to be com-
pleted by the end of the year. At
present there is sufficient juice for the
co., the new plant being in the nature
of a standby. When completed, the
power unit will consist of five 1100-h.p.
Diesel engines and five Diesel-driven and
one electric-driven compressors. Under-
ground, the drive on the 1200 ft. Horse-
shoe No. 2 level has been extended to
the Hannan’s Star lease, as well as a
branch to the Chaffers shaft. During
the past month 150 ft. has been driven
on the Morrison east lode, values being
355. over the full width of the drive.
* * * *
Adelaide-controlled Golden Horseshoe
(New), Ltd., treated 37,920 tons from its
show at Boulder (W.A.) during August
for a yield valued at £4509 (gold at 855.).
Working exes, were £4389 (Aust.). The
recoveries during July realised £7447
(Aust.).
* * * *
Hidden Secret, a north-end Kalgoorlie
tellluride prize-packet of years ago, has
been offered to Adelaide promoters.
Fairly rich gold- and silver-telluride
shoots were worked to a shallow depth
by a party of Italians, and over 15,0000 z.
of bullion were extracted from 10,000
tons.
* * * *
Chapman’s Gold Mines, N.L., late of
The Granites (Central Aus.), is now
working on the Great Western at Wilson’s
Patch, near Leonora (W.A.). The man-
ager reports that the eastern drive has
been advanced to 53ft. 6in. No. 1 cross-
cut is completed, showing a reef 9ft.
wide. Samples are to be forwarded for
assay.

Amalgamated Collieries (W.A.) hopes
to return to the div. list as a result of
an award increasing the price of coal
supplied to the State Government, the
co.’s biggest customer, by Is. a ton. The
extra shilling should help revenue along
by at least £16,000 a year.
* * * *
The Casino Syndicate, Perth, has
taken an option at Lennonville (W.A.),
embracing the old Yuletide and Fulltide
mines. A quartz lode, 30ft. wide, runs
through the property, and a crushing of
100 tons of selected stone is expected to
average an ounce or more.
* * * *
Aberfoyle Tin, Ben Lomond (Tas.), for
the year ended June 30, showed a profit
of £10,685 ; divs. of 12] p.c. were handed
out on both prefs. and ords. Sales of
concentrates brought in £34,109, the
average price realised being £225 a ton
(up £s4) v Wolfram brought in £10,416.
Working profit was £15,985. Accounts
show liquid assets of £13,738, with a
surplus over current liabilities of £9292.
The mill put through 10,234 tons of ore
for 195 tons of firsts and 215 tons of
seconds. Management reckons that the
lodes are tending to increase in size with
depth, and that values are maintained, if
not improved. Estimated ore reserves at
June 30 were 12,788 tons proved and
10,711 probable above the No. 1 level;
on the No. 2 level reserves were put at
45,476 tons probable. ,

“That’s a Good Girl”
Jack Buchanan defies modernism in
this picture of a young man of fashion
who with a friend (Garry Marsh) is
chased about Europe by a truculent
prima donna (Vera Pearce). Spurning
the poker-faced restraint popularised by
the male beauties of Hollywood, he
makes each slightest emotion tell its
story. His features don’t get a moment’s
rest, and when he isn’t seen contorting
them or gesticulating violently the reason
usually is that he has hurled himself
backwards into a bath or through a
hedge. His naive technique gives the
film a pre-talkie flavor which is added
to by his clothes. The editor of the
“Tailor and Cutter” will probably agree
that cricket blazers are not worn at Con-
tinental luxury hotels. They never were
worn away from cricket fields even in
England, though characters in the early
silents favored them almost as much as
they did frock-coats.
In its heartiness and absence of nudity
sequences and obscene language, “That’s
a Good Girl” is almost a period piece,
and the farce is period stuff too. Not-
ably the sequence in which the hero gets
mixed up with the supers, while the for-
midable heroine is singing. It caused
howls of laughter on the opening night.
This film is at Sydney Mayfair. So
is “Kamet Conquered,” which shows a
British exploration party struggling to
the highest peak on the earth’s surface
that has been scaled by man. Both pic-
tures, by the way, are also at Melbourne
Athenaeum.
“Glamour”
Now and again a talkie comes along
which wins both ways; the producer
contrives to delight the vast majority of
addicts who want sentimental lies and
also the few who like the truth.
“Glamour,” at the Liberty, is an
example. Constance Cummings is first
seen as a gauche chorine in pursuit of
the celebrated composer Paul Lukas. She
marries him, and portrays successively a
worshipping mother, a temperamental
star, an adulterous exotic and a repentant
wife who goes home to find her child
dying and her husband in sore need of
her.
Behind all the conventional eroticism
and false pathos lies a domestic situation
which is as common as that in “Madame
Bovary.” Lukas is any easygoing hus-
band who has been married for his posi-
tion by a vulgar trollop. Miss Cum-
mings gives a realistic picture of the
kind of wife who looks round for a
change after a few years of married life,
and inevitably picks on a philanderer.
Philip Reed —an astonishingly good-look-
ing newcomer to the screen —is the
philanderer. In such cases the wife
always goes home when abandoned by
her admirer, and the husband usually
takes her back, and they get on fairly
well till another good-looking man
appears. There is a fine cast, but its
members are only feeders to Miss Cum-
mings.
“Mystery of Mr. X”
A London thriller splendidly acted by
British-American stars. Robert Mont-
gomery is a gentleman-burglar operating
at the same time as a homicidal maniac
who specialises in policemen. Mont-
gomery crosses the killer’s path while
stealing a super-diamond; is suspected
by Lewis Stone, of Scotland Yard ; and
wins the love of Elizabeth Allan, daugh-
ter of Stone’s chief (Henry Stevenson).
Love comes into its own when Mont-
gomery, by a remarkable feat of reason-
ing, puts his finger on the place where
the next policeman is to be dispatched,
and in an exciting sequence ends the
murderer’s career.
The hero rather overdoes his famous
ease of manner ; he might be even more
charming if he were not so conscious of
his charm. But the others are absolutely
right. Henry Stevenson and the Cock-
ney taxi-driver are brilliant.
“Half a Sinner”
How well we talkie-frequenters know
him! It is Berton Churchill on this occa-
sion who talks religion, carries a flask on
his hip and makes cards do his will.
When Joel McCrea, who loves Sallie
Blane, is falsely accused of theft it is the
oily but good-hearted deacon who un-
masks the true offender. As a reward the
sheriff lets the ethical shandygaff get out
of town with his odor of sanctity unim-
paired. The part was made for Churchill,
who has been playing pompous old hum-
bugs for so long that they have become
second nature. A wrestling bout and
some bridge and poker soirees keep the
narrative going for the conventional hour
and a quarter. At .Sydney Capitol.
“She Was a Lady”
Helen Twelvetrees operates her sad,
sweet smile throughout this opus, which
tells, with wearisome insistence on detail,
the story of 10 or 12 years of her life.
Her father (Frank Morgan) is a drunk,
“THAT’S A GOOD GIRL."
At Sydney Mayfair: Diagram shows (1) Jack Buchanan, ( 2 ) Elsie Randolph

banished by his haughty English family
to Montana for marrying beneath him.
His dream is that his daughter shall
“return to England to take her rightful
place in the family.” She does so,
having earned the fare by circus-riding,
but the family is unenthusiastic. So
she goes back to Montana to wed
dissolute Donald Woods, reformed by
her pure influence. But Donald’s
millionaire father objects to her, so
she becomes a decoy bird in a
gambling joint, till happiness dawns with
the approach of fade-out time. A con-
tinual shifting of scenes and the intro-
duction of dozens of irrelevant incidents
help to obscure the point of this strange
narrative.
“The Life of Vergie Winters”
At Sydney Regent. It commences in
1912 in an American small town. John
Boles, an aspirant for Congress, is in
love with Ann Harding, a milliner, but
is tricked into marrying ambitious Helen
Vinson. Discovering that Ann really
loves him, he talks of a divorce, but
Ann won’t let him ruin his career. So
while he goes from strength to strength
she is ostracised. He adopts their child.
The showdown doesn’t come for 22
years, when he is shot by his wife in
circumstances that place the blame on
the wretched Ann. Prison, a death-bed
repentance by the real murderer and a
reconciliation between mother and
daughter make an appropriately cloying
ending.
The pre-war frocking is accurate, but
the wearers almost without exception are
costume-conscious.
“Merry Wives of Reno”
A good farce. Guy Kibbee is an err-
ing husband with a wonderful capacity
for lying himself ever deeper into the
mire. Almost as funny is Hugh Herbert,
a Nevada sheep-farmer who leads a pet
lamb throughout the picture, and whose
blind trust in his wife even extends to
believing that the two brand-new over-
coats which he finds on his hall-seat on
returning home unexpectedly are his
own.
Margaret Lindsay and Ruth Donnelly
as two of the wives assist in the team-
work, and Frank McHugh, the hotel
bellboy, shows how his profession can
be made to yield big dividends.
“His Double Life”
A fantasy based on Arnold Bennett’s
“Buried Alive.” Two weaknesses are
the title—heaven alone knows why
Hollywood must change these things—
and Lilian Gish, the sentimental heroine.
Roland Young plays the painter, who
is so retiring that no one but his secre-
tary knows him.
The secretary, it will be remembered
by Bennett fans, gets ill; the doctor who
is called in takes him for his employer,
and so does everybody else. When the
secretary dies he is buried in the Abbey,
and Yourtg is considered mad when he
claims to be the painter. Then he meets
the woman who has been correspond-
ing, through a matrimonial club, -with
deceased; they get married, and she
thinks he’s mad, too.
He starts painting again, and the work
is recognised. The court case which fol-
lows —jury, counsel, Judge and gallery
acting as a chorus chanting “He’s mad!
He’s mad!” —is a gem. It’s at the Civic.
A Topical Reference
Zane Grey’s “Men of the Forest” is
dull stuff. U.A.P. supporters may get a
certain amount of satisfaction from the
fact that the villain (Noah Beery) is
named Beasley. Beasley is bad all
through, and no right-thinking person
will regret his death at the hands of the
woman who has nurtured him for 20
years. Randolph Scott and Verna Hillie
represent the forces of virtue.
Sundry Shows.
In its battle against the Screen in
Australia the Stage is handicapped by
the fact that its rival is first in the
field with successful plays. Somerset
Maugham’s “The Sacred Flame,” pro-
duced at Sydney Cri. on Saturday night,
depends for its due effect upon the un-
expectedness of its denouement. Those
in the audience who had seen the film or
read accounts of it were supping on what
the Scots call “cauld kail het again.” But
they did not waste their evening.
Maugham was sedulously Bowdlerised
for the screen production ; the stage play
is more concise, more plain-spoken,
clearer of purpose, and immeasurably
stronger.
The current stage production is well
cast, and Gregan McMahon has done
his admirable best with it. Grace Lane
makes Mrs. Tabret a memorable figure,
her voice beautifully modulated; her
atmosphere serene and graceful. Jane
Wood, as the nurse who fell in love with
her patient, makes the part understand-
able ; even sympathetic. Kathleen Good-
all’s Stella began flatly on the opening
night, but gained life as the action de-
veloped. Gerald Savory (as the paralysed
husband) and those ever-reliables Harvey
Adams and Kenneth Brampton, in
elderly parts, could hardly be bettered.
John Cameron’s Colin is a mere stick ;
but that’s more the playwright’s fault
than Cameron’s. The Firm has very
seldom, in recent years at any rate,
staged anything of commensurate diffi-
culty which has been so nicely balanced
and so adequately presented.
Sydney’s Eisteddfod paraded its sweet-
est fruits at the Town Hall on Saturday
night. Its harvest included four choirs
which the Commonwealth wouldn’t need
to be ashamed of in any company, a
bevy of solo singers of very high quality,
and violin and pianoforte exponents
whose performances showed rich
promise. Musical fare provided was ex-
tremely varied, and in addition to better-
known stuff the vocal duet arrangement
of Chopin’s E Flat Nocturne, which
present critic hasn’t heard sung in public
for 25 years, and an aria from Sullivan’s
long-buried grand opera “Ivanhoe” (pro-
bably never before heard in Australia)
figured on the programme. There were
rejoicings over the annexation of the
inter-State choral championship by a
Sydney choir —R. McClelland’s Students
—which won the trophy last year also.
# * *
Sydney shows some faint promise of
brighter theatrical business. “The Beloved
Vagabond” is still going strong at the
New Tiv. “The Sacred Flame” occupies
the Cri., and should keep that stage
(soon to vanish for ever) occupied for a
bit. At the Royal, “Gay Divorce” ends
its run to-day, to make way for “Blue
Mountain Melody” (libretto by Bancks,
music by Zwar), which is the Firm’s
reply to Thring’s very successful attempt
to make musical comedy manufacture a
local industry.

WHAT LYONS HAS DONE
The Lyons Government restored confidence at a time when
the people were beginning to despair. It brought the Gow
ernment finances from the verge of bankruptcy to a position
of solvency. It stimulated primary and secondary industry
and created employment when one in every three was
workless.
WHAT LYONS WILL DO

By returning a reliable Government—a Lyons Government —
Australia will consolidate the gains won in the past three
years. The programme outlined by the Prime Minister in

ensure recovery. The promises indulged in by other leaders
are fantastic and impossible.
200,000 have been put back into jobs.
Primary Industries have been assisted to the

ABORINGINALITIES
“Spare Mendel”: Though
animals nearly related will in-
terbreed freely the horse-
donkey cross which results in
the mule is the most familiar
instance—there have hitherto
been no established cases of
the hybrid offspring proving
fertile. Melbourne Zoo thinks
it has set up a new record in
this particular. A couple of
years ago director Miller
mated a dingo with a wolf —
these dog-wolf crosses are not
uncommon. One of the hy-
brids of this union he mated
with a wolf, and the lady has
produced a litter of puppies.
At present she is in retire-
ment, and about as approach-
able as a maddened tiger-
snake, but the opportunity of
photographing her unique off-
spring and noting down their
peculiarities, if any, is being
eagerly awaited.
•I” 'i*
“Coolabah”: I pasted a disc
of blue paper on the front of
a hive, just above the entrance,
and watched results. They
were practically negative;
work still went on without a
hitch. I gave the toilers a
couple of hours in which to
get used to the blue disc, and
then covered with a red one.
The first couple of pollen-
carriers pulled up sharp on
the ledge of the hive, took off
again and hovered about, but
wouldn’t enter. In about a
quarter of an hour homers
were swarming about the front
of the hive ; those inside came
out to go on with their job,
but on returning none of them
would pass the communistic
poster. I obliterated it, and
business went on harmoni-
ously again.
“Ancient Mariner”: In these days,
when the first impulse of the average
dweller by sea or land is to kill any
creature new and strange to him when
he comes across it, it is pleasing to read of
the treatment of an albatross in Sydney,
even if it was confined in a bag. The
sea-wanderer was driven ashore on the
North Coast of N.S.W. in heavy weather
—a most unusual happening for a bird
which frequents the stormiest seas in the
world —and came in due course to
Taronga Zoo. There it was nursed back
to fitness, and the other day was en-
trusted to the chief officer of the Mon-
terey, who was asked to liberate the
lordly fowl well out in the Tasman Sea.
sjc * H= *
“Tom Willie”: I’m coming in on the
side of “C.L.8.” (B. 22/8/’34) in the cat
argument, although I’m with “Felis” in
disqualifying the freak marsupial. There
is a wild-cat indigenous to Australia. Ex-
cepting for size and certain color-mark-
ings, it resembles the cougar or puma
(Felis concolor), found from British
America to Patagonia. The cougar is
tawny-brown in color without spots;
the Australian wild-cat has dark spots,
almost black, and is twice the size
of a well-conducted large tomcat. I
know what I’m talking about; I trapped
one and spent four hours in making sure
it wasn’t a marsupial, tame cat or jim-jam.
For six months we hadn’t been near a
pub.
•j- :Jc
“Laetitia”: It was a typical “nor’-
west” Papuan night. The launch
chugged monotonously up the moonlit
estuary of the Fly. Suddenly I was
startled at the appearance of several
perpendicular columns of incandescent
light, not unlike electric-light standards.
Drawing nearer I noted that “the elfin
light fell off in hoary flakes.” This
solved the mystery ; the luminosity came
from myriads of fireflies that had
swarmed on the tree-trunks.
* * * *
“7346”: Last summer a dry-area cul-
tivation paddock near the M.I.A. (N.S.W.)
had had no rain or water of any kind for
some months. Digging showed the soil to
be quite dry to a depth of four feet. It
rained about an inch one night ; next
morning the surface was alive with big
fat earthworms all over the paddock,
about two to the square foot. Whence
and how?
* * * *
“Dai R.”: The white man isn’t the
only one to devise barricades against
marine enemies. A few years ago croco-
dile-proof fences of stout bamboo, inter-
laced with other suitable vegetation, were

common in the river-mouth villages of
the Papuan Gulf, and probably still are.
They were designed to prevent the wily
saurians from seizing those who came
to get water, particularly women and
children. They were mostly semicircular
in form, and generally reached half-
way across the river. Where villages
were opposite each other, both sides co-
operated and built right across.
ming was also indulged in inside the
enclosure, and special traps were set out-
side for any crocs, that might stickybeak.

Willie’s” tucker-box par. (B. 15/8/ 34),
I’ve discussed this subject with old
inhabitants, and the acknowledged
legend is that the dog incident occurred
nine miles from Gundagai, off e
Gundagai-Coolac mam road, where a
teamster and his waggon were bogged
on a black-soil track for several ays.
That individual told the story to the late
Sugar O’Brien, who kept a wayside pub
on the aforesaid main road, five miles
from Gundagai. The remains of that
historic structure may still be seen from
the dog-and-tucker-box monument. This
accounts for the different five- and nine-
mile versions.
“Jim Grahame”: Re those dog-ballads.
Under the title of 'l he Immortal
Dog,” my verses were published
on this page about six months before
those of Jack Moses appeared in
his book “Beyond the City Gates.”
Apart from the fact that they were both
written round the same subject, there is
no similarity either in words or metre ,
and, although Jack’s effort was a little
later, the result was well worth waiting
for.
* * * *
“Xover”: Saw a queer flight of birds
at the Tooroorrong Reservoir (Vic.).
About 50 cormorants arrived, circled the
lake a couple of times, flew up three
hundred feet or so, and, with an eerie,
crescendo swish, literally dropped head-
first. Though they skimmed the surface,
none actually dived. They repeated the
performance three times, and then flew
off to the south, whence they had come.
Don’t know whether it was just a playful
stunt or the spying out of future fishing ;
but I’m sure about my 2s. spent on a
permit to fish being a dead loss.
* * * *
‘Dorsal”: Two large elephant (or
“ghost”) sharks were caught recently in
Tasmanian waters, one at the southern
end of the D’Entrecasteaux Channel, and
the other some miles from the mouth of
the Derwent. Tasmanian Fisheries’ patrol-
vessel netted the curiosities, which were
3ft. long—unusually big specimens.
Though grotesque in appearance, the
tribe is beautifully colored when alive,
. . . , . .. .
marked with a curious trunklike appen-
dage—really a bony hook, fitted at one
end with brush-enamelled teeth. The
flesh is palatable.
* * * *
“J.R.D.”: I’ve heard gallons of ex-
planations re rushing bullocks, but most
reliable cattlemen shake their heads and
venture nothing. A puff of wind throw-
ing a screened campfire into sudden
flame, a horse stumbling, or some noc-
turnai animal disturbing the mob is
sometimes the trouble. Certain camps
have sinister reputations—like Job’s
Camp on the Georgina (N.Q.), where
they say even a well-travelled mob will
rush. The incredible suddenness of the
change from sleep to blind panic is un-
canny. A good night-horse will always
anticipate the rush a fraction before the
rider. Was once on watch with a young
fellow, who was sitting carelessly
in the saddle. When the mob went
I found his riderless horse galloping up
the wing beside me, and my mind pic-
tured the job of collecting my mate in a
sugarbag next day. He was safe in
camp when we got the mob back about
daylight. His horse had shot out from
under him simultaneously with the cattle,
and all the unprepared rider knew of
that rush was a roar and a cloud of
dust.
T * * *
“Cam Cove”: The foot-stamping
method “Jim G.” employs for drawing
foxes out of burrows (B. 29 /8 / ’34)
seems to me like putting salt on a
guinea-pig’s tail. Cunning, sense of smell,
intuition and what not combine to keep
Reynard seat-warming once he gets on
to a good possie. The only time he will
leave a burrow is when he has scoffed
up the contents of the larder or has been
dug out. His favorite place of abode is
a hollow log, and anyone who can get
to within a half-mile of the log without
disturbing him may send to me for
the A-grade certificate of membership
in the Liars’ Club.
* * * *
“Cudgerie”: “Tripod” (B. 29/8/’34)
may have found an abo. graveyard in
the Coomera Ranges (s.-e. Q.), but I
very much doubt it; in these parts
Binghi invariably adopted tree-burial.
The bones of tribesmen killed in battle
were carried around for many months,
and before burial were wrapped in tea-
tree bark and placed, not in the branches,
but usually in the bole of a specially-
selected hollow tree. Felling a tree in the
very ranges of which “Tripod” writes we
came upon an abo. skull and bones in
the base, the cavity in which they had
been placed having completely grown
over.
“G.C.”: A “morning glory”
is a frequent occurrence
in the Gulf country. Dur-
ing a stay in Burketown I
witnessed one. A low bank
of clouds lined the horizon
early in the morning, and
gathered speed at an alarming
rate. I felt sure we were going
to have a deluge. On it came,
a threatening, dark, rolling
cloud ; soon the sky was com-
pletely overcast. A few drops
of rain fell ; then we had a de-
lightful breeze which lasted for
a couple of minutes. Away
went the dark cloud as quickly
as it had come, and the sun
continued to blaze as merci-
lessly as ever. Burketown is
situated on a hard, dry clay-
pan where it is practically im-
possible to grow anything—
not even the other kind of
morning-glories so well known
in other parts of Queensland.
* * *
“Kali”: Am surprised that
the Albany fishermen have
mistaken tunny for albacore
for so long (B. 15/8/’34). The
fish are closely allied, but the
pectoral fins of the albacore
are almost twice as long as
those of the tunny, while its
body is only half the size. The
tunny’s tail is more deeply in-
dented and more strongly
forked, the fish being so per-
fectly streamlined that it moves
through the water with a mini-
mum of effort. The flesh of
the albacore is only good for
fertiliser down at Cocos
Island we dumped tons of the
fish into the gardens ; that of
the tunny is excellent eating.
Where we hooked tunny at
will —only 1500 miles from
W.A.: —they averaged about
sft. and tipped the scale at well
over the 2001 b. mark.
“W.P.T.”: Bushmen still aver that the
death-adder stings with the spine on its
tail, but a ’Bidgee whaler is convinced
that the wriggler uses the thing as a
decoy for small birds. He hides the rest
of his length in the grass or rubbish and
wriggles the spiny extremity after the
manner of a worm. When the bird
swoops to pick up the “worm” the adder
strikes and never misses.
* * * *
“Bark”: Native-cats are protected
under the Destruction of Rabbits Act in
the Speck, but the little fawn dasyure
with white spots soon disappears when
bunny arrives. The reason is that young
rabbits are eaten skin and all, and the
cat, having out-of-date internal gear,
soon succumbs to disorders arising from
balls of fur being caught up in his clock-
work. A post-mortem exam, on cats
trapped at Great Lake when bunny was
a new arrival confirmed this.
THE BERSERK.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
At midnight, when the shepherd birds
Had stilled their melodies,
And moon and stars cloud-hidden were,
There came a great wind down the hills
To battle with the trees.
A fiend unseen, with berserk rage
And fell design he leapt
Through chasms dark and mountain walls
Where, hunting done and howling stilled,
The stealthy dingo crept.
Ice-cold and charged with awe the night
At his fierce onset grew,
And, looking back with daunted eyes,
Before him Silence shivering lied,
And Sleep affrighted flew.
Tall mountain-ash and river-oak
And stately pine he sought,
And there, gigantic in his wrath,
The giants of the riverside
And timbered slopes he fought.
Relentless in his rage he tore
The great trees limb from limb,
While far and near and shrill and high,
Resounding through the watching hills,
Uprose his battle-hymn.
An ancient fight renewed was this —
Fought oft through ages
A feud long treasured from the past;
No rest was there for anything
The while he battled on.
Torn limb and leaf and tattered bark
Before his fury swept;
And only \Vhen, exultingly
With cruel cries, he passed away
Men breathed in peace, and slept.

“Cachalot”: Syd Miller’s cats that
come back so miraculously in The Bul-
letin must hand the biscuit to the whale
that recently invaded Sydney Harbor.
Ihe amiable creature was wallowing
about for some time without the usual
coterie armed with all sorts of inade-
quate weapons attempting to kill it. Then
it was rammed by a Manly ferry and
sank without trace. A day or so later
it bobbed up serenely in the Harbor
mouth, by this time slightly more
aldermanic about the waistcoat. A tug
was employed to tow it to sea, and
dwellers in Manly and Vaucluse wiped
their brows and thanked heaven. Next
morning it was sighted making for a
landfall somewhere about Bondi or
Coogee. By this time it was more aider-
manic, and wild panic followed until a
tug again came to the rescue. The fol-
lowing day the devoted creature was try-
ing to lay its bones and the rest of it
all somewhere about South Head. Once
more a tug to sea and an assurance that
the matter was at an end. As I am
writing this comes news that the animal
is inside Botany Heads and making for
the beach. It has developed a wild exotic
savor that even Botany, where all the
fellmongering works flourish, cannot
stomach. If it is not too late, I sug-
gest that the Australia and Canberra be
requisitioned to tow the corpse to sea
and torpedo it. It would be a good
advertisement for the Australian Navy,
which doesn’t seem to be doing much
nowadays.

“Humpy”: The other afternoon I
was sitting on the verandah of my house
within 40 yards of the sea in Whitsunday
“S’pose I’d better drop it down, A If; it might be urgent.”
Passage (N.Q.). I was reading “Tharshe-
blows” (B. 8/8/’34), agreeing with what
he wrote, and was confounding those who
thought otherwise. I heard a miniature
thunderclap behind me. There, less
than half a mile distant, I saw a whale
performing, with a killer in attendance,
I got out the glasses, which brought the
object to within 100 yards of me; I
could note the eyes of the whale—and
they’re small enough, goodness knows!
That whale leapt 20 to 30 feet clear of
the water; hit with a splash and a thud
which shot foam in all directions;
squealed like a stuck pig, and when it
spouted there was more than mist and
vaporised air which came from its nos-
trils. I could see the rain falling and
the tops of the waves levelled as they,
are when drops of water descend on
them.
“Plag.”: zEsop’s fable of the shepherd
boy who cried “wolf” so often that no
one came to his rescue
when one did arrive
has been duplicated at
Coraki (N.S.W.). The
local bobby locked up
a man who seemed to
be well on the way to
“the horrors.” The
John Hop felt no sur-
prise v/hen later fear-
ful yells about seeing
snakes issued from the
cell. There was no-
thing with which the
captive could harm
himself, so the custo-
dian let him carry on
for a bit to exhaust
himself. But the yells
and objurgations were
accompanied by such
an assortment of other
noises that J.H. de-
cided to investigate.
.Sure enough, there
was a snake, a big
black one ; it had been
battered to death on
the floor of the cell,
and the slayer was still
laying into the corpse with his only
weapon—what had once been a tin
pannikin.

“ ’Arney Street”: “W.P.T.’s” par. (B.
8/8/’34) reminds me of an old parrot
which used to fly about the Grey River
(M.L.) a few years ago. It would imi-
tate the seagulls in their flights about the
river, to their evident disgust. Its
efforts to coast along without moving
its wings were very funny. If the parrot
attempted to alight on the mast of a ship
the gull in possession would receive it with
wide-open mouth, and the others would
be excited and noisy. So, unlike the
gulls, it had to settle on the stays, watch-
ing them closely and thinking out its
next move. The last time I saw it it had
retired from the sea and was killing time
teasing cats and dogs from backyard
fences round by the goods-sheds in Grey-
mouth.

“Stiff”: Here’s an entry for the Queer
Accident Stakes. A Victorian farm-
worker went out on horseback carrying
a rifle. Later man and nag were
found dead, and shot by two different
bullets, the horse through the shoulder,
the rider through the head. The police
theory was that the man was carrying
the loaded rifle when he accidentally
shot the horse. As the nag dropped
under him he must have pitched forward,
and the reloaded rifle scored its second
hit. The papers describe the weapon as
a “repeater.” It was obviously an auto-
matic. The coroner has agreed with
the police.

“A.U.”: At Patonga, Hawkesbury
River, there are heaps of cockleshells,
thrown there, probably centuries ago, by
“ How’s your husband, Mrs. Koperu?”
“All, las’ week he ket te seizure.”
“Indeed! His heart?”
“No; te police.”
abos. The heaps are about 35 yards in
diameter and 20ft. high, and in the course
of time have turned to lime. I’ve dug
down into the shells, once retrieving
from these old rubbish-tips an abo. axe.
Whether the shells have any commercial
value or not is doubtful; men have tried
to carry them away, but transport on a
large scale is almost impossible in that
rugged country.

“Resbo”: Spot, our N.S.W. station
mong, has two redeeming qualities—
speed and sportsmanship. He was chas-
ing a rabbit when bunny’s tail caught on
a barb while hopping through a fence.
Spot sat and gaped at the squealing and
gyrating quarry suspended in mid-air
until it shook itself itself free and hit the
breeze again. Away bounded the eager
hunter in pursuit, but in the big paddock
he had no chance.

“Mugshut”: As a slow-grower can
anything beat the common grass-tree?
In 1924 I noticed one near Stawell (Vic.)
to be exactly the same height as a near-
by fence-post. After 10 years it hasn’t
grown quarter of an inch.

“J.8.J.”: The flesh of the goanna is
seldom eaten by white men, but when
put through the mincer with a little beef
it makes excellent rissoles. Correct
proportions are fifty-fifty—one goanna,
one bullock. Cooked, it is practically
impossible to tell the rissoles from those
made entirely of beef.
“R.G.”: Queer things have been hap-
pening to horses in the Gordon (Vic.)
district. A farmer’s moke passed out,
and the farmer elected to plant it on
the line of Toohey’s (now Gordon De-
velopment) reef, the last crushing from
which returned 300 ounces from 9\ tons.
The grave was dug, but was never used as
such: there was a nice reef in the bottom
of it. About the same time another dis-
trict nag looked up from its grazing and
saw Ashton Brothers’ circus passing on
the way to Melbourne. The elephant was
towing one of the “red waggons.” Never
having beheld such an apparition, the
horse rolled over and gave up the ghost.

“Top-rail”: Those big yellow hornets
(B. 29/8 / ’34) have black bands around
their bodies which give them a footballer
effect. To an old mate of mine they
recall bitter memories. Jogging along
with a packhorse from Cooktown (N.Q.)
he happened to spot an orchid in a tree,
one of the famous white variety, then
worth £3O to £5O. Very carefully he
strapped it to his swag across the pack-
saddle. Soon afterwards, as he was pass-
ing under a clump of sandalwood, the
orchid lightly brushed a large honey-
combed nest suspended from a branch.
The hornets stung him badly, and the
pack-horse bolted. When found two
days later the pack was under its belly,
his gear was all gone, and so was the
white orchid.

“Theine Dhu”: Can’t say whether
jackasses in Maoriland are dumb or not
(B. 22/8/’34), but one I met in S’Africa
years ago chortled merrily several times
a day, and he had the liberty of the
garden only. Kaffirs would sit solemnly
in front of the garden fence for hours
waiting for Jacky to perform. As soon
as he opened his bill and gave the pre-
liminary chuckles the blacks would break
into peals of mirth, some of them end-
ing up by rolling helpless with laughter
in the dust.

“Eureka”: It’s possible to be too good
at imitating rabbits, as a South Coast
(N.S.W.) man discovered. He concealed
himself amongst bushes and imitated
bunny’s squeal. His rendition was so
good that a fox sneaked up unobserved,
charged at him and bit him on the
shoulder before he could shoot. It’s hard
to say who got the greater shock, the fox
or the shooter.

“Austral”: Fond as the cat is of
mice, he will not touch the native mouse.
I killed one once thinking it was an
ordinary mouse ; finding it was one of
the native species, I took it home to
puss. He became very excited when I
held it- up for him to see, but walked
away disgusted after closer inspection.
THE CLIPPER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
There were long pennons in the wind,
Blue banners in the sky,
When with a shouting gale behind
You made the whitecaps fly.
Yet, as a vision in a dream
Moves with a beauty soft,
To us you were a far-off gleam
Of white with gold aloft.
We see you as men see a light
Pass, or a shooting star
Blaze through the purple, silent night,
Most beautiful and far,
Yet know that trail of splendor brave
Is an iconoclast;
So your white wake on that far wave
Tells of a queen who passed—
A queen of clippers, driven hard,
Each sail like iron set,
With seamen punching on each yard
At canvas stiff and wet,
And steersmen fighting with the wheel,
And down-hauls sheeted home,
While, ruthless as a god would feel,
You ploughed the sea-gods’ foam.
Far down the years your royals gleam
With gold of sun aloft;
Strange as a vision in a dream
You move in beauty soft;
Yet there were pennons in the wind,
Blue banners in the sky,
When you stormed round the world, to find
The fame that would not die.

STUFF TO GIVE 'EM
MEGGITT'S LINSEED MEAL
PRE-SALE SCOURING.
“Murrawong”: “Jumbuck’s” advo-
cacy of scouring wool before sale (B.
22/ 8 / ’34) works all right in some cases,
but several factors are likely to keep
the proportion of scoured wool sold at or
below its present level.
Country scours will always be limited
because of lack of suitable water, unless
recently-discovered improvements in
processes become available for general
use.
Some years ago I saw a demonstration
before leading international woolbuyers
of scouring wool without removing it
from the bale. The buyers approved
the principle, but were unanimously
against its adoption, because it entailed
scouring before sorting. Their opinion
was that if all wool were thus treated it
would not only increase the difficulty of
sorting for manufacture, but all sorters
would have to learn to sort scoured wool
—a much slower and more difficult job
than sorting in the grease. In this lies
one reason for lack of competition lor
locally-scoured wools, and the difficul-
ties are increased by the blending which
goes on in some scours. Except in some
Q’land districts, a more likely method of
treating low-yielding wools faced with
long-distance railage lies in the wider
use of “willeying” machines, which
shake out the dust and remove the
rougher vegetable from the wool. This
saves freight on tons of dust and sand,
and leaves the staple in the grease.
SHED EFFICIENCY.
“Jumbuck”: “Murrawong” is right (B.
15/8/’34). Graziers for the most part
seem nowadays to go for the cheap and
hurry-up shed methods. In many con-
tract sheds in Queensland I have noticed
one picker-up making heroic attempts to
attend to five and six shearers. Results
are only too obvious. The wages of an
extra picker-up in a shed where 5000
sheep are to be shorn, and where six
shearers are employed, would, with keep,
be less than |d. per pound. In every
case among hundreds which I’ve seen
the owner would have gained at least
id., and possibly Id., per pound had the
contractor provided an extra hand.
Contract shearing seems to have taken
firm root, but it is surprising that the
graziers’ associations do not continue
to stipulate the minimum numbers of
shed-hands that must be employed in
proportion to shearers.
Could some of the old-time graziers
return to earth, they would loudly con-
demn the way fleeces are ripped ,and
torn, and the manner in which skirting
and piece-picking are now carried out.
THE NOOGOORA PROBLEM.
“Dead Finish”: Through not obeying
a Lands Department order to clear his
holding of Noogoora burr, a N.Q. grazier
has been served with a notice of for-
feiture. Drastic perhaps ; but the damage
done to clean country through lessees
neglecting burr is terrific. This pest is
carried by floodwaters from infested
areas and sown over useful country.
In every Crown lease a clause requir-
ing eradication of noxious weeds is in-
cluded. A misguided sense of loyalty
to a fellow-grazier prevents many a
defaulter being reported. The Lands De-
partment itself is not altogether blame-
less. Every time a lease comes up for
reappraisement before the Land Court
the occupier of a clean holding is handed
a higher rental, while the party who deli-
berately neglects his property usually gets
off with the original rental or a reduc-
tion.
It is often said that Noogoora does not
make any difference to the price that
wool brings. Seeing that it is an extra
weight in the clip that has to be paid tor,
and that clearing it out before manu-
facture involves labor costs, this seems
sheer nonsense. Woolbuyers are not
dunces.
USING AN EMASCULATOR.
“Narooma”: “Sheepo’s” cmasculator
for lambs (B. 22/8/’34) may be all right,
but my experience is that, while these
instruments are effective in the hands ot
a careful man who thoroughly under-
stands their use, they are slower than
the knife and make too many misses.
Lamb-marking is a busy time, and
lambs whose glands are difficult to en-
gage in the jaws of the instrument are
liable to be let go partially done. The
result is apparent in the appearance of
the mob by the time their permanent
teeth are up.
A friend bought a big draft of young
western wethers which had been emas-
culated by an instrument then being
boomed as “bloodless.” They were shorn
at my shed, and the result convinced
him that the sheep were not much of
a bargain. Each day’s shearing contained
from 5 p.c. to 12 p.c. of actual stags, for
which double rates had to be paid.
ARTIFICIAL INSEMINATION.
“Breeder”: As “Murihiku” claims (B.
29 /8 / ’34), artificial impregnation is com-
monly practised with horses in Australia,
and some breeders have used it with
other animals.
I have assisted with cows, and from
records know its value. On a Queens-
land station, the death of two stud bulls
made treble duty for the remaining male,
so that artificial methods were employed.
The impregnators were obtained from
surgical stores in Brisbane. Only in odd
cases did the cows fail.
In S. Queensland we used the method
to serve coy cows that would not get
in calf by the usual methods. Greater
use of it with cows would curtail con-
tagious abortion.
I question whether the sperm extracted
from the dead boar in Russia, as men-
tioned, would be effective, as the male
cells in the fluid do not live very long.
The outfit we used cost £2. It was worth
hundreds of calves to us.
JUDGING A HORSE.
“Jim G.”: A horse with a very flat
forehead is invariably vicious and ner-
vous —the same often applies to one with
a kink in his tail. On the other hand,
the horse with rounded and rather bulg-
ing forehead is apt to be a rogue and a
loafer.
In flat or slabsided horses and those
with small— scarcely visible—sheaths
there is not found much stamina, and
most of them are hard to keep in good
condition.
Time, with much care and kindness,
may cure shiers, kickers or bolters, but
for the tripper or stumbler there is no
known cure. , , ,
Rarely is the hollow-backed or
roached-backed horse a duffer.
Foals from a small mare and by a
big stallion usually have outsizes in heads
and small, ill-shaped bodies. But those
from big mares by a small stallion are
almost sure to be slockily-built, good
farm sorts.
Before finally buying an aged horse,
give him a couple of handfuls ol whole
corn or oats. If he grinds these up easily
and noisily you’ll know that his back
teeth are 0.K., which is the main thing.
Broken or worn front teeth don’t matter
so much, but if the back ones are gone
or irregular out he goes the first dry
* An old saying, “If he has one white
leg try him ; if he has two white legs
buy him,” doesn’t always work out.
There are duds in all colors, but to quote
another old saw, “A good horse is nevei
a bad color.”
PIG-FEEDING POINTERS.
“Large White”: Wheat is better basic
feed than maize, being richer in protein,
a good flesh-former and palatable. It
should be fed coarsely ground.
No grain mixture can form a pro-
perly-balanced ration without the addi-
tion of a protein-rich concentrate. Skim
milk will furnish most of the protein
needed, but a little meat-meal should be
included, because it contains essentials
absent from milk. Where the supply of
“skim” is limited, meat-meal is the cheap-
est substitute. It contains over 65 p.c.
protein and is cheaper than linseed or
other meals which contain less protein.
Some high grades of meat-meal also
contain bone, which provides minerals.
Pig cannibalism may be caused by
mineral and protein deficiency.
Exercise should be worked into the
feeding scheme. A crop of maize may be
partly harvested and the remainder left
to the grunters to “hog down.” Or let
them clean up matted paspalum.
Lucerne is probably the best green
crop, because of its richness in minerals
and protein. The topping-off ration, how-
ever, should include only a limited
amount of green lucerne.
Molasses can be used in limited
amounts, but it must be enriched with
meat-meal, skim milk, etc.
It is often said that molasses has a
feeding value about equal to maize, but
this is not true. Molasses, contains no
protein.
HOW NOT TO SAVE SUPER.
“Stump-Jump”: Professor Osborne,
of Melbourne University, has shown
that native plant life in Australia gener-
ally has become used to existing on less
phosphoric acid than imported cousins.
The professor suggested that dairymen
should develop a type of cow with less
phosphoric acid in the milk. He claimed
a considerable saving in top-dressing
would be possible by this means, but it
doesn’t seem likely to compensate for
a tenth of the chaos it would cause.
Cow-farmers cannot sow enough im-
ported grasses or clovers (whether local
strains or not is unimportant). These
thrive on heavy top-dressings and pay,
simply because our indigenous grasses
rarely are either palatable or nutritious
enough for milk production. It s no
good trying to stuff a cow with the
straw that many of our native plants are
about equal to. Districts where first-
class cowfeed can be grown without
super, are rare.
The main point the professor over-
looks is that even if breeders were will-
ing to attempt his scheme the chance of
altering the cow’s constitution to give
low-phosphate milk is next to nothing.
The mineral content is added directly
from the bloodstream. This is a con-
stant sum in all breeds, and its total
controls the milk flow. If the diet is
low in phosphorus the cow gives it
out of her constitution, but only up to
a point. Then, to save her health, she
dries off. “High content” milk means
only one thing—activity of the blood
system.
Another point hardly likely to com-
mend itself is the cost of testing to find
possible cows to breed from. Babcock
testing is quite costly enough, but would
be a mere scratch to testing for phos-
phoric acid. And what would the future
of young dairy stock be on this low-
phosphate milk?
KIKUYU VERSUS PASPALUM.
“Honi Pikau”: “R.J.” and “Amber”
(B 8/8/’34) apparently do not agree
with me (B. 18/7/’34) that a pasture
of paspalum, rye-grass and white clover
is superior for all-the-year utility to a
Kikuyu pasture. But I conceded Kikuyu
the identical merits which they allowed
it, i.e., it makes great summer and
autumn growth and is the best drought-
resisting grass 1 have seen.
“R.J.” writes that paspalum will
smother clover and winter grasses. It
will—if improperly managed.
Keep it well eaten down from Novem-
ber. to March (use the mower if there
is not enough stock to keep it under con-
trol), harrow and topdress, and both rye
grass and white clover will thrive with
paspalum, and make vigorous growth
when paspalum is at its worst. No other
grasses or clovers in my experience make
headway equal to Kikuyu. It smother>
them all.
For areas subject to drought and
low average rainfall, Kikiyu, as a
fodder producer, would be hard to beat.
In areas of average rainfall, provided
that the land is well drained, the pas-
palum-rye-grass-clover mixture, treated
my way, will supply a next-to-perfect all-
the-year pasture, and will also give more
volume of feed in the aggregate than any
other combination of grasses 1 know.
FARMERS’ STEEL LORE.
“Tractor Mac”: There’s no need to
buy a bench-drill for farm work get
a set of metal drills with square shanks
to fit a carpenter’s brace and a Starret
centre-punch.
Use the centre-punch to mark the spot
and always give it a dull blow free lrom
bounce with a heavy hammer. A
few turns with the brace, put the centre-
punch back on the spot and give another
blow, followed by a few more turns ?
the brace. Using punch and drill
alternately, the job is fairly easy.
Always put a small bit —a quartei-incn
—through first if the hole is to be a big
one, and follow on with a bit of
the right size. When dull, grind the
bits on the same bevel as they had when
new, and remember to keep each cutting
lip the same length, otherwise the hole
is larger than the bit. If you want an
odd-sized hole, grind one lip of the bit
down a bit more than the other, testing
it on a bit of scrap-iron until it cuts a
hole of the desired size.
If emergency drills are needed, torge
one end of an old file to a square shank
to fit the chuck of the brace, and flatten
the other out like the edge of the
ordinary cold-chisel. Place the chisel
end on the horn of the anvil or any
round bit of iron while hot, and with two
taps of the hammer bend each side ovei

could not have been got with any other machine.
Also, the 1 Oft. Sunshine Header which we procured
from you six years ago has given every satisfaction. It
has worked in all classes and conditions of crops, and
took off 2300 acres for the total cost of ss. 6d. for parts.
The wide wheels on both machines make them light

to give a twist like that of a drill to the
point. File the two lips to shape, heat to
a clear red and dip half an inch of the
point into oil. Hold it there while you
count ten, take it out, give a quick rub-
bing on the ground to clear oil and
scale from the point, and then watch
the hardened part. It will first turn
yellow, then brown, and the brown will
begin to take on a purple tinge. As
soon as this color gets to the tip put
the tip into water and very slowly lower
in the rest.
When working steel in the fire, never
heat to more than a clear bright red, and
dust a little borax on to it. It is some-
times hard for an amateur to tell the
difference between iron, mild steel and
tool steel.
Tool steel, if one end is heated to a
clear red and then slowly lowered into
water, becomes as hard and brittle as
glass and cannot be marked with a file.
Mild steel works nicely under the
hammer at a dull red and does not split
as it cools. Cut nearly through when
cold and then broken, it breaks cleanly.
Iron splits if worked cold or at a red
heat. It has to be forged at while heat.
If cut nearly through and then broken
while cold it has a fibrous grain like
wood.
CORRECT HITCHING TO SAVE
POWER.
“Shallow Draught”: Most farmers
fail to realise that incorrect hitching of
implements to tractors means heavier
draught, less efficient working and
heavier running costs.
The main thing is to see the implement
follows a straight line of draught to the
tractor.
Even where it is necessary to plough
with the tractor on the “land” and the
implement is travelling to one side, the
line of travel should run parallel to the
tractor.
Hitching too high pulls the front of the
plough down and increases the draught.
Hitching too low tends to throw the
plough upwards, making control harder,
besides wasting hauling power.
When pulling two implements parallel
with each other it is important to see that
the load on each side is equal.
Any inequality of strain throws the
tractor out of alignment, causing power
waste and friction.
DISEASE IN RABBITS.
, “Valerin”: Reports of outbreaks of
disease in rabbits in an English labora-
tory, due to an acute virus, are being
hailed as a pointer to a method of ex-
terminating rabbits in Australia.
There is nothing new in this scheme.
As far back as 1906, Dr. Danysz, of
France, in conjunction with Dr. Tids-
well, of Sydney, carried out exhaustive
experiments on Broughton Island, with
a view of introducing a virus into
rabbits. It was declared to be effective
and specific to rabbits.
About the same time a disease among
rabbits appeared on Yalgogrin (N.S.W.),
and the opinion was that the “Danysz”
and “Yalgogrin” microbes had a
common parentage.
When the Federal and N.S.W. Gov-
ernments absolutely vetoed the introduc-
tion of these cultures there was a howl
from graziers.
With our unfortunate experience of
“imported” pests the dissemination of
any disease should be prohibited.
MAKING FLOODGATES.
“Doitnow”: Twist four No. 8 wires
firmly together and fix securely above
the highest known flood level. From
the cable suspend lengths of net-
ting long enough to allow one foot to
lie on the bed of the creek. Let the edges
slightly overlap each other. The portion
on the creek bed must face downstream.
Next join all these edges, but only as far
enough up to make the gate stock- and
rabbit-proof. Lastly, cover the foot on
the creek bed with sand.
When the flood arrives, it will wash the
sand off, and force the gate to rise with-
out damaging it. As there is nothing
attached to the bottom, logs and other
debris float underneath it without being
able to catch in it. Since we have adopted
this method the biggest flood has failed to
take our gates.
In small creeks where a rabbit-proof
gate is required, and where there is not
too great a volume of water, let two
posts into the creek bed about four feet,
one on each side, and join with a squared
bar. This must be above the highest
known flood level also. Next make a
four-sided frame to correspond with the
distance between bar and creek bed and
the two posts. Nail any old iron to this
frame securely. It has to stand a good
strain at times. Hang this from the cross-
bar by three strong hinges, placed so that
they will open upwards on the down-
stream side. When swung, place a bed
plate underneath it, and securely fill up
any space between the posts and the
banks. This can be done with stakes.
Again the water opens the gate, which
closes as the water recedes.
Only attention gates need (if properly
made and swung) is to see that they are
not jambed with debris after a flood,
and so let rabbits in.
HINTS FOR THE FARM.
“Milko”: A good way to protect your
circular-saw is to halve an old motor-
tyre and place it over the saw.
“Grunter”: To grow outsize man-
golds, suitable for storage, use lcwt.
amm. sulph. per acre, and thin out to
lOin. intervals. Pull them two weeks
before use, and put them through a
cutter before feeding.
“A.G.T.”: To make a small screw-
driver, snip the ends of a 2in. piece of
clock spring to a taper. Fit one end into
a plug of wood.
“Carinya”: Where rats and mice in-
vade sheds and stables and burrow under
floors, put flake cyanide in their main
holes, as for rabbits. Put a piece of tin
over opening and cover with cement or
concrete.
“Wrash”: The tangs of small tools
like awls, chisels or screw-drivers can
be made to hold permanently in wood
handles. Use a cement made of 4oz.
resin, loz. beeswax and loz. finely-
ground brick-dust. Melt together, stir-
ring thoroughly. Roughen the tang with
a file. Pour the cement into the hole in
the handle and force the tang into place.
“Sheepo”: As a drench, a bluestone
solution will deal with intestinal worms,
but there’s such a thing as overdoing the
use of it. Many graziers drench with
bluestone even though their sheep and
lambs are not worm-infected. If given
to worm-infected sheep too often, or to
those not affected, chronic poisoning is
likely. Any sheep treated with a blue-
stone drench that pass urine of a dark
red coloiy or a ny that lose condition for
no a pp ar ’ en t reason, are probably over-
dosed

The last time I held down this dual
position I found it most confusing. , I
combined with myself well enough when
I worked back at the office at night, tak-
ing the keys out of my director’s pocket
when I locked up and putting them in
my nightwatchman’s pocket. But as I
was also my own typist, long periods of
dictating to myself resulted in my present
habit of talking to myself, I was handi-
capped, too, in that 1 couldn’t sit on my
own knees whilst dictating.
1 used to delight in giving myself
instructions. But if I'd stopped on that ,
job much longer I’d have
gone off my tiead.

the end I made applica-
tion to myself for an

were making wouldn’t
stand it, and I had to re-
ject my request. As I

satisfaction I asked myself
that my resignation be

HUNTS.
“English visitors have been disappointed at
the lack of hunting in Australia.”—' "Herald.”
This is a libel. We have a greater
variety of hunting than any other coun-
try.
Let the visitors turn landlords for a
while and join in the regular Monday-
morning hunts. The quarry is particu-
larly hard to locate. It locks all doors
and windows, hangs out a notice “Back
To-morrow,” then plays the wireless to
drown the hunters’ knocking. The sport
is full of danger. Dogs are often let
loose, and wives sometimes have to be
interviewed.
Then there is winner-hunting, con-
ducted everywhere. If the newcomers
are doubtful about anything, they should
ask a milkman, tram-conductor or any-
body else, and they will soon be en-
lightened. If the advice is conflicting,
back the lot. If, by some mistake, one
of those backed rolls home, the real
hunt commences. S.P. bookmakers have
baffled the best of huntsmen.
Lady visitors who find football tame
might try bargain-hunting. It is per-
missible to take a husband to cariy the
spoils.
Another popular sport is house-hunt-
ing. Novices are always surprised to find
how far they can throw a stone from the
station or walk in a minute. Wet
weather should be chosen so that the
hunters get the thrill of wiping their
muddy shoes on somebody else’s carpet.
Hunters should pop in at the most un-

expected moments, hoping to catch the
tenants off their guard. It is a sign of
particularly good huntsmanship to arrive
when the only occupant of the house is
in the bath.

HER MISSION.
The frail young lady with the blue,
child-like eyes gazed anxiously up and
down the street. She seemed bewildered,
lost. Well might an onlooker have asked
what was she doing in Darlinghurst at
2 a.m.
Around her, sinister shapes lurked in
dark doorways. Occasionally the silence
was broken by a satanic chuckle or a
stifled scream.
Presently she began to walk, still with
that pitiable, lost look about her. She
glanced nervously at each building she
passed. Suddenly a look of recognition
came into her face. That was it!
She ran up to a window and tapped
three times. It opened.
“Send six bottles around to No. 7,”
she whispered. “The party’s run dry.”

PEEPS AT THE PROFESSIONS.
111. —The Poet.
Poets dying with rheumatics;
Starved, and perishing with cold,
Hoarding in their tiny attics
Reams and reams of rhymes unsold.
Well-fed critics warm and fat
Mock their work, forgetting that
If poets didn’t write bad verse,
They’d probably do something worse.
Those who think that all a poet needs
is long hair and a rhyming dictionary are
much mistaken. Poetising is a profes-
sion which should only be taken up by
people of the most altruistic principles.
The poet must be content to work for
nothing. All true poets die in penury (or
as near as they can get to it under the
dole system). Shakspeare, contrary to
general opinion, was not a poet. He
owned, among other things, a second-best
bed. No true poet ever owned a bed at
all, being content to pillow his head in
the daisies, buttercups, Scotch thistles or
other flowers in season, and to lie under
the wide and starry (or cloudy as the
case may be) sky. Of course, he needs an
attic or garret to keep his manuscripts in,
but he never dreams of sleeping there.
In addition to being poverty-stricken
he must also be crossed in love. The
crossing may be plain or variegated. The
loved one may have returned his affec-
tion, but married another to save the
family fortunes. Or she may look on
him with cold disdain. She may have
died before he had
time to tell his love
(this is particularly
possible in the
case of blank-verse
poets). Or perhaps
he may have only
seen her passing
by.
Finally, he may
never have seen
her at all except in
imagination. This
is all the better as
it gives him a free
hand in describing
her hair, eyes, etc.,
which can be made
any color that will
fit the rhyme. But,
whatever the cross-
ing, his love-life
must definitely
have been blighted,
or, speaking poeti-
cally, blit.
Poets of to-day
are greatly handi-
capped compared
with those of the
past. All the good
smff, which they
are quite capable
01 writing, has
already been written. There is really
only poor verse left to be written nowa-
days, yet, when a poet writes some of it,
unthinking editors, critics and readers (if
it gets so far) condemn it.
After all, there is a limit to the number
of combinations of words that can be
strung together, and the truth is that the
poets and near-poets of the past have
exhausted the supply. It would be a
boon to poets if the English language
were abolished, and Esperanto or Arunta
substituted. Some of the moderns have
anticipated this movement by using
words in other than their dictionary
sense, and by inventing new words.
Ignorant critics have discouraged them.
The Poet Laureate is the only poet who
can be sure of getting any reward for his
work. There is some doubt as to the
exact nature of his emolument. Some
say he gets a keg of sackbut. Others
claim it is a butt of sack, while a third
school swears it is a sack of butt. Per-
haps it is just a sack, or possibly only a
butt.
In any case it is not much to support a
growing family on.

Method of cleaning and polishing a pair of
bullock horns ? —3231.
Scrub the horns well in hot soapy water,
rinse in cold water, and set aside to dry. Rub
the rough parts with sandpaper, then with fine
glasspaper. Make a paste of emery powder
(knife powder will do) mixed with neatsfoot
oil, and polish thoroughly with a piece or
flannel. Finish with chamois, then with a piece
of old silk. If the process is too laborious,
after cleaning the horns give them a coating
of white shellac dissolved thinly in _ methy-
lated spirit, applied with a brush: this gives
a bright, transparent lacquer.

What is the difference between woodcuts and
wood-engravings ? —2983.
- In woodcutting, softwood such as sycamore,
cherry,*■ holly or maple is used. The cutting
is.done with a knife and gouges. The knife
is held, like a pen, and gives a line V-shaped
in section which is made by two oblique cuts.
The gouges are like those used by a wood-
carver, but-only five or six inches long. The
work is done along the grain, which is used to
heighten the effect, of the design wherever
possible. Wood-engraving is done on a block
of hardwood, usually box, which is cut across
the grain. The "cutting is done with gravers
and scorpers very similar to those used in
metal engraving. They are solid in section, not
hollow on their upper surfaces like a gouge,
and the front cutting-face slopes backward at
an angle of roughly 45 deg.
Recipe for a vegetable-oil promade ? —3lBO.
Mix 1 part white wax with 9 parts olive oil
(perfumed). Another formula is: White wax,
2 drachms; cetaceum,.3 drachms; almond oil,
2 ounces; cocoanut oil, 4 drachms; spirit
myreiae (bay rum), 20 drops. Melt the waxes
together with gentle heat, gradually incorporate
the oils and beat in the bay rum when almost
old.
(1) Space necessary for a bowling green ? (2)
Where to obtain rules of bowling ? —3278.
(1) Not less than 110 ft. nor more than 125 ft.
in length, divided into rinks not less than 17ft.
and not more than 20ft. in width. (2) From
N.S.W. Bowling Assoc., 128 Pitt-street, Sydney.
(1) In cremation, is the coffin burnt with
the body? (2) When the body passes out
of sight at the Crematorium, what happens ?
—3207.
(1) The coffin is burnt. (2) The coffin is
moved directly into the cremating chamber,
the heat of which rises to approximately 2200
deg., which quickly disintegrates the remains,
all that is left being a pearly-white ash.
Friends or relatives are allowed, upon request,
to witness the commitment of the remains and
the process.
What would be my position, so far as the Old
Age Pensions Dept, is. concerned, if 1 were to
accept a gift of £l2O from an old-age pensioner
(not declared when pension was applied for) on
the understanding that 1 will pay his funeral
expenses, ‘ erect a tombstone to himself and
his wife and not include the amount in statement
of assets when declaring for probate purposes ?
lam appointed by will as his trustee. Pensioner
is possessed of other property, declared in his
application for pension. —3269.
Your position is covered by Section 52 d (4) of
the Act, which provides: “Any person who
acquires from a pensioner, otherwise than bona
fide and for value, any land, or any estate or
interest therein, shall, upon the death of the
pensioner, be liable to pay to the Common-
wealth the debt due to the Commonwealth in
respect of the pensioner under Section 52e of
this Act to the extent of the value of the prop-
erty acquired by that person otherwise than
bona fide and for value after deducting there-
from any sum actually paid by him to the
person by the Commissioner in any court ot
competent jurisdiction. “Section 52e of the Act
provides that all pension paid after 31/12/’32
will be a debt due to the Commonwealth on the
death of the pensioner, and will be payable out
of the estate after all other debts whatsoever
have been paid.
(1) How to make sticky clay soil suitable for
gladioli ? (2) Is September too late to put
bulbs in in Sydney ? Best planting methods ?
—3209.
(1) Mix into the clay plenty of sand, loam,
grit and leaf mould, and provide drainage to
carry off surplus water. (2) Bulbs can safely
be put in up till October, but in warm districts
protection should be given to the blooms. Set
the bulbs about 4in. below the soil, and place
stakes to keep thp stalks upright. When the
flower sheaths show apply liquid cow manure.
I have trouble with cacti in pots; they bloom
very rarely, and rot away. Treatment ? —3204.
Trouble is probably due to unsuitable mat-
erial used in the pots. Cacti must have good
drainage. Fill the pots with cinders or char-
coal, and reset the cacti in them; then add a
little soil on the surface. Dissolve four tea-
spoonfuls of potash in a kerosene-tin of water,
and give half-pint of it every week to each pot-
plant.
Do gerberas benefit by artificial fertilisers ?
—3329.
Don’t use strong, burning, artificial manures.
A little superphosphate mixed into the soil about
the base of the plants has a beneficial effect;
but, where procurable, it is better to use rotted
cow manure. Agricultural lime is also an
excellent tonic, and keeps snails and slugs
from destroying the buds, which come from
the base of the clumps.
(1) Most reliable method of striking carna-
tions ? (2) Is there a ready market for blooms
in Sydney, and what is the average price per
dozen ? —3320.
Carnations can be struck from pieces of limbs
which have flowered, but layering is preferable.
Place boxes of soil around the plants and bend
the limbs, breaking or slitting them where they
enter the soil. A hairpin or piece of wire
should be placed over the bent portion to keep
it under. When the plant has struck (in about
six weeks) sever the limb from the parent plant,
remove the box and set others in their place.
(2) There is a good market for high-quality
blooms, preferably pink and white. Before
quoting a price florists will need to see
samples and ascertain the quantities likely to be
supplied.
Names of the ductless glands of the body
and what are their uses? —3174.
They are the pituitary, pineal, thyroid, para-
thyroid, thymus, supra-renal and coccygeal
glands; also the spleen and the lymphatic glands.
All except the last' two are internal secretion or
endocrine glands. The pituitary controls growth
of the skeleton and body in general. Absence,
deficiency or atrophy of the thyroid gland pro-
duces organic disorders of far-reaching effect.
The great influence of the thyroid on metabolism
is due to the iodine in specialised combination.
Muscle tone is influenced by the supra-renal or
adrenal" glands—when over-stimulated these
bodies cause a temporary rise in blood pres-
sure. They produce a substance known as
adrenalin which acts upon the sympathetic
nerves. ; - • ,

Was Shakspeare ever an actor ? —3337.
Yes, for certain; although the well-known
lines in the sonnets:—
“Alas! ’tis true I have gone here and there
And made myself a motley to the view,”
may not refer to-his profession of; acting. His
name is published frequently in lists of the
Lord Chamberlain players in the reign,of Queen
Elizabeth; and, under King James; he,is named
among a group of-12 well-known actors, sworn
officers of the royal household as “grooms of
the Chamber” in ordinary, without fee. The
appointment did not entail any regular house-
hold duties, other than'those of players. He
is also in the casts of. the plays of Ben Jonson
and of other dramatists. He “did act exceed-
ingly well,” says Aubrey (1626-97). But Rowe,
the .first biographer; (1709),. after sifting all the
gossip and .evidence - of - a hundred years, re-
ceived the impression that he was “no extra-
ordinary actor,” and that “the top of his per-
formance was the ghost in his own ‘Hamlet.’ ”
I do a bit of play-producing in a N.S.W.
country town. I always have a little difficulty
with properties and effects. How might I
overcome the trouble ? —3319.
Make a complete list of props, and write
out lighting plot, and noise and effects plot,
complete with cues. Find three dependable
offsiders, and, if they are inexperienced, give
them a Spartan training. A young woman is
generally the best “Props,” especially if she is
good at drawing and modelling. There are
books in most libraries giving amateurs plans
and all particulars; or they may be purchased
at Will Andrade’s, Sydney. Such a book should
also give details for the production of thunder
and other effects. Your electrician must have
a keen pictorial and dramatic sense or the
scenes, dresses and make-up will be spoilt.
This advice applies to each department of stage
work.
What are Tanagra figures, and where may
they be seen? —3153.
Small, beautifully modelled terra-cotta figures
found in Greek tombs at Tanagra. Similar
figures come from Myrina in Asia Minor.
Many of them have the same torso, but dis-
similar heads. A separate mould was kept
for the heads, which imparted a good deal of
variety to the subject. One of the best col-
lections in the world is in the British Museum,
but almost every gallery and museum has
samples. A collection was shown at Anthony
Horderns’ Gallery, Sydney, about 10 years ago.

“4 x 2”: “X.S.’s” accused (B. 22/8/’34)
wasn’t the original of sticking to con-
vention. My grandfather and a Ger-
man were arrested on the Potomac dur-
ing the Civil War. Both were accused
of spying for the North. Grandpa pitched
some tale and they let him go. The Ger-
man, unable to supply a plausible ex-
planation, was informed that he would
be shot as a spy. Quite unperturbed, he
replied resignedly: “Veil, vateffer’s the

“Cauboy”: In Sweden they put the
money derived from State lotteries to
better use than we do. In Stockholm,
Gothenburg, Malmo and Helsingborg
are handsome theatres whose subsidies
come from the kroner of the lottery-
addicts. Lately the collapse of the smalls
has been engaging the attention of the
Government, and it now has on the road
companies with munitions of enlighten-
ment to the extent of £5OOO. The quality
of their provender gives an indication of
the standard of rural culture amongst
the Scandinavians. Eugene O’Neill’s
“Mourning Becomes Electra” toured 16
towns to packed houses, and the play
that Shaw wrote in the intervals of tell-
ing the Maorilanders how to run their
country is on the programme.

“A.W.U.”: The thief who stole the
spare tyre from a car outside Melbourne
Law Courts (B. 22/8/’34) sets me think-
ing of my own experience with “Waxy”
at Parkhouse Camp. Orderly-room
and guard-room were in one weather-
board hut, and a Clock was fixed
above the two doors, with a sentry
always on duty beneath it. “Waxy”
pinched the clock at 10 a.m. ; at 11
military police, civil police and bar-
rack warden were hunting for it; at
noon “Waxy” was bargaining over the
beer counter of the sergeants’ mess. He
wanted two quid. The police force
came in for a drink, and into “Waxy’s”
eyes came a look of entreaty. I served
him with two pints, and slipped the clock
behind a 36-gal. barrel. Next morning
he called again, suggesting that he would
take a bit less than his original price. I
offered him another six pints on condi-
tion that he put the clock back at once.
At noon he called for the pints, having
replaced the enemy above the orderly-
room door despite police force, sentry
and stuttering O.C.
“Maltworm”: 1 fancy the man who
drank beer for breakfast in an Austra-
lian hotel to-day would be regarded with
suspicion by all hands and the cook.
Yet we of an elder generation made a
habit of it, in tropic as well as
temperate parts, without any apparent
harm—anyway, it didn’t hurt me.
London “Times” has been holding a sym-
posium on how long beer-drinking at
breakfast-time prevailed in the univer-
sities. Lord Northbrook says the prac-
tice was general at college breakfasts in
his day—well into the 1880’s —a couple
of tankards being regarded as an appe-
tiser. After that you devoured your
breakfast, washed down with what tea
and coffee you might require.

“A. Cretin”: If any newspaper will
start a “Give It a Name” competition
with a prize for the reader who names
the year’s most superfluous cable, I’ll
undertake to win it with an account of a
duel in an anonymous “small town not
far from Naples.” There had been
quarrels between an unnamed “man and
a woman,” and they decided to “put an
end to their unhappiness by fighting a
duel. They chose revolvers.” The woman
wounded the man badly and was
wounded slightly. No more. If one of
them had been killed or arrested and
tried for anything from illegally posses-
sing a revolver to murder, or if they had
made it up and been married, or if one
of their seconds or even a # passing dog
had got shot, the item might conceivably
have been classed as front-page news.
Or if their names or even the name of
one of them had been disclosed, or the
name of the alleged town. And the
rubbish came from Rome, where excit-
ing things are happening almost every
hour!

“Crossbelt”: A Parliamentary resume
of British Army reforms strikes stagger-
ing blows at tradition. Infantry are to
discard packs—a mighty sensible move
—and will carry automatic rifles in place
of the present arm. And the exceedingly
gold-mounted Royal Horse Artillery is
to give up its nags and 13-pounders for
tractors pulling 3.7 howitzers. When
cavalry regiments were wholly or partly
mechanised the R.H.A. was accustomed
to refer to them as “the 17th Stinkers,”
or words to that effect. This naturally
led to bloody reprisals by the rank and
file ; but that is all over.' It seems now
to be a case of “aren't we all?”

'‘Cage”: The Springboks are the latest
to enter for the world's croquet cham-

sending a team. What the Afrikanders
are like is a matter beyond knowledge
of the huge and comprehensive following
which, according to London “Morning
Post,” has made the game one with an
intense popular appeal in Australia. If
they are anything up to the standard of
the Rugby footballers from over there,
who have for years been walking on the
faces of England, Ireland, Scotland,
Wales, France and, in a lesser degree, of
Maoriland and Australia, 1 can foresee
the Zambuks very busy when the Tests
are being played in Melbourne.

the team. In all, this is the eighth win
for the Red Rose since the competition
started in 1873. The county has shared
the honors three times, twice with Notts
(1879, 1882) and with Notts and Surrey
in 1889. Eckersley's four-shilling piece,
which got so much publicity in the Test-
match tossing, is being blamed for the
Lancashire victory, Eckersley losing the
spin only three times in 30 matches.

“Aigburth”: In spite of press reports,
the atmosphere in which the Australians
are dwelling in England is not all
brotherly love if we read between the
lines. One diehard mob styling itself
“Six Cricket Lovers” has rushed to Lon-
don “Telegraph” with a plan to discom-
fit the beastly colonials. The members
point out that the fact that most of the
counties depend for existence on Austra-
lian visits keeps them under the whip,
so to speak. Each member of the syn-
dicate will give £lO if 9994 other mugs
will do likewise. The resulting £lOO,OOO
will be used to subsidise the counties
on condition each promises it won’t
allow its professionals to go to Australia
in 1936 or play in Tests against Aus-
tralia in England in 1938!

The Steering Column
BRITISH-BUILT 8-H.P. FORD TESTED
UNDER TRYING CONDITIONS.
BY FRED BERRY.
CHEAP TO RUN, EASY TO DRIVE AND SAFE ON GREASY ROADS.
OPERATING costs are so important to many motorists that
until a few years ago a section of the motoring community
had perforce to ride in glorified perambulators in their endeavors
to secure fuel economy.
Now a number of “baby” cars provide riding and passenger
comfort equal to that given by family models five years ago.
Latest to be tested over “The Bulletin” course, the British-built
8-h.p. Model Y Ford, demonstrated clearly that a fuel consump-
tion of approximately 40 m.p.g. can be achieved without
personal discomfort and without sacrificing reasonable speed.
Although in the baby class so far as
engine capacity and wheelbase are con-
cerned, the neat little sedan provides
front-seat passengers with generous
leg room, while those in the rear are
quite comfortable. Furthermore, although
The British-built 8-h.p. Ford sedan tested over The Bulletin course, showing
long bonnet, slanting windscreen, wide, sweeping mudguards and general “big-
car” appearance.
it would be absurd to expect snappy
acceleration in top gear at low speeds, a
touring gait of between 35 and 45 can be
maintained over all reasonable grades
with less than half-throttle opening. In
those cases where steep grades are met or
the driver desires extremely rapid accel-
eration in traffic the synchromesh gear
makes changing simple and silent.
An outstanding feature, of course, is
handiness in traffic, for with a steering
lock of 29ft. 6in. right and 31ft. 6in. left,
together with a wheelbase of 7ft. 6in. and
track of 3ft. 9in., even the novice can
handle otherwise difficult manoeuvring
problems with the greatest ease.
Driving the Model Y Ford one can
scarcely Relieve that the power unit is
smaller in capacity than some twin-
cylinder motor-cycle engines. With a
bore of 2.23 in. and stroke of 3.64 in. the
4-cyl. unit has a swept volume of but
56.93 cub. in. (933c.c.). R.A.C. rating
is 7.96 h.p., and maximum power de-
velopable is 21 h.p. at 3500 r.p.m.
Detachable cylinders of special high
compression type (6.2 to 1) are fitted ;
pistons are of aluminium alloy, and the
crankshaft, running in three bearings, is
balanced statically and dynamically.
These features, coupled with the live
rubber mounting of the motor in the
chassis, reduce vibration to a minimum,
and, except at low speeds in top gear, the
motor is quite smooth in operation,
Valves, side-by-side type, are of steel
so compounded that stresses and wear are
resisted —to such an extent that no provi-
sion for adjustment is incorporated.
Cylinder bores are offset |in. from per-
pendicular in order to reduce angularity
of connecting-rod, and so provide a
slightly longer stroke and reduce shock
of power impulses.
Full-pressure lubricating system is used,
oil being fed to crankshaft, big end and
camshaft bearings by a submerged gear-
type pump. Gudgeon-pins and cylinder
walls are splash lubricated.
Battery-and-coil ignition is used, and
automatic advance and retard of 26 de-
grees is fitted in the distributor head.
Generator and fan, both on one shaft, are
driven by a belt from the crankshaft.
This unit is mounted in an accessible posi-
tion above the cylinder block and is pro-
vided with a simple method of adjust-
ment.
Petrol-tank, capacity 6\ gallons, is
swung between rear dumb-irons, and fuel
is taken to the carburettor by a dia-
phragm type mechanical pump driven
from the camshaft.
Bolted directly to the induction mani-
fold, the automatic down-draught car-
burettor is declared to provide a correct
mixture at all engine speeds. Air and
idling adjustments are readily accessible.
Transmission is through a single-plate
dry disc clutch, permanently adjusted for
tension, to a three-speed and reverse unit
Sectional end view of the 8-h.p. motor,

gether with accessibility of all units.
type gearbox, with silent-running, con-
stant-mesh intermediate gears, with heli-
cal teeth. A synchroniser of the cone-
clutch type is- used in the gearbox to
ensure quiet and easy engagement be-
tween high and intermediate gears. Gen-
tral ball-change control is provided, the
lever being of sufficient length to come
easily to the driver’s hand.
Final drive from gearbox to back axle
is through closed propeller shaft run-
ning on ball-bearing universal joints, the
outer casing of the propeller shaft, to-
gether with radius rods, absorbing all
road and power thrust. Rear axle is
l floating type, and reduction ratio of
spiral-bevel pinion and gear is 5.43 to 1.
The chassis is
of conventional
type with sturdy
cross members.
Due to charac-
teristic Ford
transverse semi-
elliptic springing,
front and rear,
the ground clear-
ance is approxi-
mately 9in.
Braking equip-
m e n t on all
four wheels is
mechanically
operated with in-
ternal - expanding
shoes. Foot-
brake actuates all
four units, while
hand-brake
operates on rear
wheels only.
Steering is of
worm - and - nut
type, with provi-
sion for adjustment of wear, and the
cast steering-wheel, smooth on top and
recessed below, gives the driver a com-
fortable, yet positive, control.
Bodywork is all-steel with neat and
clean profile. Front seats are bucket
type, that of the driver being adjustable.
Six side windows, safety-glass windscreen
and rear window of generous dimensions
provide unusual light and visibility for
a car of this size.
The outfit is complete in every par-
ticular, including five wire wheels,
bumper-bars front and rear, automatic
windscreen-wiper, etc.
Driving test was undertaken through
squally rain and under dirty road condi-
tions, the sedan being driven by D. Pin-
nock, of Dominion Motors, N.S.W. dis-
tributors. The car had been driven 5099
miles by a private owner, and was taken
direct from service without preliminary
tuning or adjustment.
Through congested traffic in city streets
the little car was taken with the
greatest ease, and, although the motor
was rather fierce in top gear below 15
m.p.h., at higher speeds the power impulses
smoothed out and the car exhibited a
surprising turn of acceleration. As a
result, a satisfactory average was main-
tained to Parramatta. Once on the open
road the speedometer needle was kept
round the 40 mark, which seems to be
the most economical and comfortable
cruising speed, and a top-gear run was
made to Windsor, where, in a test of
rolling—starting at 15 m.p.h. in neutral
—the Ford travelled 614 yards before
coming to a standstill.
Over the measured mile the time occu-
pied, 67sec., gave an average of 53.7
m.p.h.—a fair performance for an 8-
h.p. motor in pulling a closed body and
a load of 17|cwt. Furthermore, one had
the impression that the little car would
go on indefinitely at this speed.
On the way to the timed climb of
Kurrajong Mountain the by-pass road
through Grose Vale was taken. Here
the unmade-road surface was extremely
slippery and badly cut up by heavy
lorries, but despite this handicap the pilot
was able to use the car’s narrow track to
advantage by straddling the ruts. Though

established, the
distance being covered in 22sec., finishing
at 45 m.p.h. and averaging 32.7 m.p.h.
Acceleration to 50 m.p.h. from a standing
start occupied 22 2-ssec. ; 10 to 30 m.p.h.
in top, 12 4-ssec. ; and 10 to 30 m.p.h. in
second, 6 2-ssec., each of these tests
demonstrating the liveliness of the
engine when once momentum has been
obtained. Efficiency of braking equip-
ment was next measured, and from a
speed of 25 m.p.h. the car was pulled up
in 26ft. 6in. without skidding.
Fuel used during the journey of 119
miles was 2 7-8 gallons, giving an average
of 41.4 miles per gallon (35.7 ton miles),
which, when the average road speed
of 35.7 m.p.h., inclusive of all tests, was
taken into account, must be considered
as an excellent performance.

A New Motor Spirit.
Due to the general use of high-com-
pression cylinder-heads, modern motors
have become more susceptible to knock-
ing and detonation
than earlier engines.
Therefore special
fuels have been de-
signed to eliminate
this irritating and
wasteful trouble.
Latest in the field is

eration and maxi-
mum power without
knocking even in engines using extremely
high-compression pressures.

although it was a prodigal eater of oil before, it
now uses a quart to 150 miles. I had the oil
filter removed, and pressure has now jumped
from 25 to 40 pounds. What’s wrong ?
Fitting new rings to a car of this age without
first having cylinder bores trued up is only
wasting money, for the old rings, worn with the
cylinder barrels, are usually a better fit. Bump-
ing up the oil pressure has naturally aggravated
the trouble, and until you can arrange for a
rebore or reline it would be a wise plan to ex-
periment with the oil-pressure release-valve and
bring pressure back to 20. The motor is
“sloppy,” so you need have no fear of seizure.
H.A.D. (King’s Cross, N.S.W.).— Do the new
type linen cleaning-cloths, used instead of
chamois, give satisfactory service on a Duco
finish ?
Yes; they give splendid results, and have a
reasonably long life.
E.S.G. (Perth, W.A.).—(l) Weight of 8-h.p.
Ford sedan ? (2) Is head of special design to
meet requirements of new fuels ? (3) Is start-
ing difficult with new high compression
motor? (4) Does the newly-designed head
reduce R.A.C. rating by giving same power
output as earlier engines of greater capacity ?
(5) Most economical road speed with two up!
CD I44cwt. (2) Yes. (3) No. (4) R.A.C.
rating docs not take into account cylinder head
design, merely bore and stroke, but the new
Ford 4-cyl. engine does develop greater horse-
power than many others of equal cubic capa-
city. (5) 35 to 40 m.p.h.

describing and j llustratu }f j h f
drausht carburettors as fitted to iy34 cats '
“Carburettors,” by L. J. Henderson, obtain-
able 26 Wentworth-avenue, Sydney, 2s. 6d.
E.H.C. (Clayfield, Q.). — Is an upper
cylinder lubricator preferable to oil in petrol ?
(2) Can I obtain a lubricator giving automata
cally a charge only when stai ting. ) it
a 1933 Studebaker Six is it advisable to use
upper cylinder lubricator, or will it foster
carbon ?
(1) Yes. Lubricator supplies special oil more
effective for the purpose than that used in the
crankcase. (2) As it’s the charge when switching
off at night that counts, why worry about the
other end? (3) Will improve performance, and,
if special oil is used, will not form much
carbon.
F.V.T. (Coonil, Vic.). —(1) Cylinder capacity
of the 6-cylinder Continental, bore 3 jin., stroke
4-in. ? (2) Correct pressure for tyres with
average load of four people ?
Six-cylinder Continental is 3in. x 4in.
(capacity 169.6 cub. in.). Possibly you refer
to the 4-cyl. model, 3fin. x 4in. (capacity
143.1 cub. in.). (2) 321 b. to sq. in.
R.E.R. (Annerley, Q.). — Some drivers coast
downhill with clutch out and gear lever in
top. Does this reduce life of car ? Just
where and why does damage occur, and why
are some cars fitted with automatic clutches ?
Depends upon type of clutch and withdrawal
mechanism. Old cars equipped with multiple
disc clutches could not be coasted in top for
five minutes without risk of seizure. Old type
single-plate units were less prone to damage,
but this practice played havoc with withdrawal
mechanism and spline. Modern motors fitted
with automatic clutches have low plate pres-
sures and huge bearings of the non-wearing
type to take care of the greater loads imposed.
L.A.H. (Weston, N.S.W.). — It has been my
custom to pick up various friends on the way
to business. I have been told that, should my
passengers be injured in an accident, my in-
surance policy does not cover me. What
is the position ?
Depends upon conditions imposed by insur-
ing co. Clauses affecting the issue vary. Until
a few months ago you would be personally
liable in any case, but recent developments
have made the position easier for the driver.
If you take any consideration from the pas-
sengers you are not insured without a special
cover.
In Australian cities the police wire-
less-patrol system uses mainly telegraphic
communication between headquarters
and cars, and thus maintains a fair
degree of secrecy. In U.S.A. tele-
phonic communication and short-wave
channels were adopted, with the result
that users of all-wave receivers were able
to listen. Under a new system an
automatic telegraph printer is used
on the police cars. The message is
thus turned out on a tape, is
visually recorded by the receiving
operator, and stored in a magazine
for reference. The element of possible
error in aurally recording Morse symbols
is removed. The system includes the use
of codes which are automatically de-
coded at the receiver. The recorder is
added to existing transmitting and receiv-
ing equipment, and takes up very little
space under the car dashboard.

The new A.B.C. regional stations will
be fitted with harmonic filters in the
transmission lines to the aerial system.
Thus radiation will take place only at
the transmission frequency. Users of
all-wave receivers will be spared the
annoyance of spurious “short-wave sta-
tions appearing at various points on the
short-wave ranges. Something should be
done about harmonic suppression with
every broadcasting station now in opera-
tion, and such filtering could well be
made a compulsory feature of the terms
of the license.

One of the obvious uses for short-
range five-metre radio telephony com-
munication is in railway work. New-
haven Railroad has equipped long freight
trains with two-way radio telephone con-
versation between the driver and the
guard. Such five-metre equipment is
inexpensive, and its advantages have
been well demonstrated in Australia as
in other countries.

A PORTABLE SIGNAL GENERATOR.
RADIO NEWS.
BY. DON B. KNOCK.
The value of a signal generator >s
apparent to the radio serviceman, the
dealer and the experienced constructor,
but, because the commercial product is
a costly affair, the idea of possession of
this asset to modern radio is likely to
remain in the nebulous stage. The
result is that attempts are made to repair
radio receivers without this indispensable
piece of equipment. The signal genera-
tor, or test oscillator, described here
is not costly, and it is conveniently port-
able. The oscillator is designed to cover
a frequency range between 160 and 500
kilocycles. This is the fundamental
range, and, by utilising the second har-
monic, a frequency range of from 320
to 750 kilocycles is available, with 480
to 1500 kilocycles for the third harmonic.
Fig. 1.
Thus the oscillator covers the standard
intermediate frequencies and the broad-
cast frequency without any coil changing
or switching.
Constructional Details.
Reference to the circuit diagram illus-
trated shows the extreme simplicity of
the apparatus, and the fact that a low
value of plate voltage is used assists the
desirable portable feature. The carrying
case, to include signal generator and bat-
teries, is no larger than 12in. by 7in. by
6in. The two views of the gear out of
the case give a clear idea of the gen-
eral construction. Naturally, as this
apparatus could be used as a frequency
standard with a fair degree of accuracy,
it is essential that all wiring should be
as short as possible and of heavy-gauge
rigid wire. If possible, the tuning-
condenser shaft should be insulated from
the panel and the controlling dial by
using an insulated coupler of the kind
used for ganging condensers in the days
of Solodynes. The audio transformer
marked T 1 should be a Philips of the
type illustrated, otherwise some difficulty
Fig. 2.
may be experienced with modulation un-
less the high-tension voltage is raised.
Using a higher voltage is, of course, no
obstacle if the apparatus is to be used
permanently in one place. The coil LI
is wound with 270 turns of 34 S.W.G.
D.S.C. on a 2in. former, and is tapped
at the centre (at the 185th turn). The
former should be of bakelite or any in-
sulating material that is not liable to
shrink or absorb moisture.
When the coil is wound it is coated
lightly with thinned, clear Duco to
retain the turns securely in place and to
prevent the coil from changing charac-
teristics. A type-33 pentode valve is
used as the R.F. oscillator and a 30 as
the modulator. Other valves can be
used in the 2-, 4- or 6-volt types, and
many combinations too lengthy to enum-
erate could be suggested.
With construction completed the whole
assembly is fitted into a metal case and
then earthed so that there will be no
R.F. pickup from the oscillator other
than via the coupling lead connected to
the output terminal.
Calibration.
It is not very difficult to calibrate the
oscillator to a close degree, but it is
essential that a good vernier dial, free
from backlash, should be used. The
National type-N is suggested (Colville
Wireless Equipment Co.), or the Efco
“Aero Junior.” Calibration procedure
is as follows: Cut a length of wiring
flex about 3ft. long and connect it
to the output terminal. A good broad-
cast receiver on which there is a
careful record of the dial readings of at
least 10 stations is required, with
these stations
spread over
the tuning
range. In place
of the aerial
connect the
wire from the
signal genera-
tor output to
the aerial ter-
minal of the
receiver, tune
the receiver to
the frequency
of 2CO Cor-
owa (560 kc.)
and switch on
the signal gen-
erator. Turn
the generator
condenser
right in, and
then gradually bring it out until the modu-
lated signal is heard in the receiver. Using
a sheet of graph paper with the dial num-
bers marked running down the left-hand
side, make a dot with a pencil at the dial
reading for 2CO, and then mark in the
frequency at the bottom of the vertical
line the dot falls on. Carry on thus until
Fig. 3.
the whole tuning range is covered. A line
is then drawn through the successive
dots, and the job of calibration is com-
pleted. The figures at the bottom of
the graph will indicate the third har-
monic, so divide \\ into these for the
second harmonic and 3 for the funda-
mental frequency.
Be careful when starting off with 2CO’s
frequency that it is the highest reading
obtainable on the signal generator dial,
as by overlapping of the harmonics two
or three settings will be found. If this
precaution is taken no difficulty will be
encountered. It is always advisable to
use the same coupling wire, as if another
of different length is substituted the cali-
bration will be inconstant. If the pro-
cess of calibration is mystifying to any
reader, the job can be done by any good
radio laboratory for a small nominal
charge.
The signal from this generator is quite
strong, and will push the output meter
well over on any good superhet receiver.
The time when the radio serviceman’s
equipment consisted merely of a pair of
headphones, battery and a cheap pocket-
voltmeter has passed for ever. With a
signal generator, analyser and output
meter, the man who “doctors” faulty
radio receivers for the public can give
his clients first-class service; but the
pocket voltmeter-headphone kind of ser-
viceman can only make guesses.

Another use for the versatile photo-
electric cell has been found in hospitals,
A patient suffering from paralysis of the
limbs can lie in bed and turn over the
pages of a book supported on a stand
by merely moving the head into the light
beam. Similarly, room lights or radio
may be switched on, or the attendant
called to the bedside.
THOSE B STATIONS
It is a little unfortunate, though per-
haps, to the profanely-minded, not in-
appropriate, that the licensed broadcast-
ing stations, as distinguished from those
under control of the A.8.C., should be
called B. It suggests that they are part
of the official alphabet, and not a few
owners of radio receivers are surprised
when they are told that A.B.C. does not
denote a grouping of A-, B- and C-class
stations, and that the Broadcasting Com-
mission has no more responsibility for
the lads who mingle art and advertising
than it has for the sanitation of villages
in Timbuctoo.
A B station is a building equipped
with powerful transmitting apparatus, the
property of its owners, who pay a £25
annual license fee to the P.M.G.’s De-
partment and thereafter are free to send
anything over the air they please, pro-
vided it isn’t libellous or indecent. Some
of the B stations are owned by religious
or philosophical bodies ; some by poli-
tical organisations ; some by limited com-
panies whose objects are not stated. But
they all strive to make a profit over work-
ing exes., and the people who believe in
radio advertising enable them to do so.
Without advertising revenue these sta-
tions would be almost as expensive to
their owners as newspapers devoted en-
tirely to news and editorial views. They
can push their own particular altruistic
barrow, if they have one, in a very few
hours a week, and all that is left for them
to do in the rest of the time is to sell ad-
vertising. To blame them for doing so
is as sensible as to condemn a cat locked
up all night in a dairy for helping itself
to cream. That radio listeners in thou-
sands work themselves daily into tan-
trums because B stations interlard their
entertainment with puffs for tradespeople
is merely one symptom among many of
the foggy state of the public mind in
regard to the whole broadcasting busi-
ness. And nine times out of ten if you
cross-examine someone who bitterly re-
viles the advertising announcers you’ll
find his or her favorite station is a B.
The national, or A, stations are very
worthy institutions. They are, among
other commendable activities, doing
more for Australian musical composers
and performers than any other agency
could hope to accomplish. In all depart-
ments they maintain a standard as high,
intellectually, as they think their listeners
will stand. Without the A stations, with
their command of public funds and their
high-minded enterprise, the broadcasting
business would be a lump without leaven.
But the B stations, outnumbering the
A’s, cater for a wider range of tastes.
They are here to stay, apparently, and
so many of their features are appreciated
by so many people, particularly the
youngsters, that they would leave a sad
gap if they were all to drop out.
If B stations are to improve it must
be through the agency of adver-
tisers. Advertisers pay the piper and
call the tune. Whether they get value
for their money or not by their present
methods is a very moot point. In their
anxiety to foil the person who switches
off the pill and comes back for the sugar
some of them have so peppered their en-
tertainment contributions with insistences
on the virtues of their goods that the
value of both entertainment and
advertisement is spoilt. And often
advertising matter is so prosaic, so
drearily earnest, that it can hope to pro-
voke naught but yawns. In the radio
field more than in any other, an adver-
tisement, to be effective, should be enter-
taining, distinguished by some turn of
grace, some flash of unexpected humor.
The old-fashioned patent-medicine ad.
that started under guise of a news item
to tell an interesting story, and sprang
its trap in the last few lines, was reckoned
effective until what the Americans would
call “readers’ reactions” were investi-
gated. Then it was found that, while Bar-
num was right and people enjoyed being
fooled, they didn’t like to find out-they
had been fooled. Even at that, the fake
news item stunt was better advertising
than that which assails the ether to-day.
B stations, because they are exploiting
a comparatively new and improved ad-
vertising medium, should be running the

Country Short-wave Explorations.
The most interesting thing that has
come over on short wave recently was
a talk by Chief Engineer Ashbridge, of
8.8. C., referring to short-wave receivers
at the Olympia Radio Exhibition. He
The Wide-World Two receiver described in The Bulletin
15/8/'34. This popular receiver is strongly recommended for
international headphone reception.
made a strong point of a new feature,
styled variable selectivity ; but sets thus
equipped are priced at about £lOO. Com-
menting on a big increase in the propor-
tion of battery-operated sets, Mr. Ash-
bridge asserted that the newest valves
made battery sets comparable to mains-
operated sets. This is cheering news to
those in the outback with battery
troubles.
It was stated in the short-wave session
from WBXK that 12RO (Roma Napoli
of old) is rebuilding and will be on the
air again shortly with a new transmitter.
The 8.8. C. stations continue excellent,
with GSB, 31.5 m., best and GSD,
25.5 m., now weakening towards closing-
time.
Electrical recordings of former talks,
etc., for the No. 1 zone seem frequently
to be distorted ; but, of course, the fault
may be due to ether conditions. FYA ;s
weakening in the afternoons, though
still good, and the signal surges.
The 19-metre transmission has been
heard at 10.30 p.m. occasionally, weak,
but with the English session understand-
able. The same applies to GSF.
RVIS has consistently been full
strength, with some very good music,
but static is increasing badly on this band.
The D.E.I. station on 49.1 m. has also
been very good at 11 p.m., but static is
also increasing there.
The League of Nations, HBL, oq a
recent Sunday, was at good strength and
easy to follow right through the lecture
from 8.30 a.m.
The foreigner on 31.56 m. referred to
previously was much weaker, and by
closing time 100 weak to convey the
English announcement. This station ap-
pears to transmit on Sunday mornings
only.
WBXK has been
again most interest-
ing in the short-

sion from 2 p.m.
Quite a number of
reports from Syd-
ney and other parts
of Australia have
been mentioned.

teur band has been

City Short-wave Explorations.
Mention of FYA Paris always recalls
the long talks in French and heavy clas-
sical music broadcast from this station.
Consequently .it was surprising to tune in
last Sunday just after 1 p.m. and to hear
the station playing “Who’s Afraid of the
Big, Bad Wolf?” It was followed by
“My Dancing Lady,” but this frivolity
was too good to last, as a very long an-
nouncement in French followed, and was
not completed when luncheon necessi-
tated leaving the receiver.
For some time a radio-’phone station
on 19m. has been operating around
lunch-time every Saturday. Though the
operator speaks clear English with an
American accent, his location for long
remained a mystery. It is a mystery no
longer, for the operator has been heard
to say that he is in San Francisco. He
works with Tokio every Saturday from
about 1 to 3 p.m.
The afternoon transmission through
Empire station GSB, on 31.55 m. and
GSD, on 25.53 m., has been coming
through very well lately, the better
of the two being GSB, which reaches
maximum strength at about 5 p.m., when
the news service is broadcast.
During the evenings the Japanese
station JVN, on 27.9 m., is still coming
in well, and has been heard as early as
5 p.m. The D.E.I. station, on 49m., con-
tinues to put over a tremendously power-
ful signal, as also does RVIS, on 70.2 m.,
although the latter station has been badly
interfered with by static for some time
past.
On a number of occasions FYA Paris
has been heard on 19.68 m. and GSF on
19.2 m. after 10 p.m. Signals have been
very weak for the most part, but on one
occasion GSF reached quite good speaker
strength.

Insulating the Aerial Mast.
The lack of attention to what is really
about the most important feature of any
receiving (or transmitting) installation,
the aerial, is surprising. In nine cases
out of ten it is an afterthought, and the
modern receiver is expected to make up
for its shortcomings. More considera-
tion should be given to the erection of
an efficient aerial, no matter how up to
date the receiver. A few radio enthu-
siasts do the job properly, and elevated
in the sky swings a well-insulated clear-
from-obstruction collector of radio
energy.
The masts holding up the aerial, it
of wood, will, after a year or two’s ex-
posure to the elements, absorb moisture,
and thus provide more or less a leakage
path to earth. The difference between
a non-insulated mast and one properly
insulated from earth may not be notice-
able at low frequencies, but it can, and
does, show up at high frequencies. For
those who wish to have their aerial sys-
tem as efficient as possible (this is of
special importance to country readers),
the insulation of a mast presents an easy
problem. The sketch shows a simple way
of doing it. The chief point is that the
ball of glass or any other good non-
conducting material must be solid and
not hollow. A billiard ball would serve
the purpose. The mast is, of course, held
vertically by insulated stay-wires.
What’s What in Radio.
Farnsworth, the television expert, has
developed in U.S.A. a new filamentless
vacuum tube (valve) which is claimed to
give millionfold distortionless amplifica-
tion without any coupling transformer.
Although it was developed primarily for
television, it can be made to function as
a self-excited oscillator or a super-sensi-
tive detector. It is reported that all that
can be done by the usual heated filament
valves can be done better by this new
“cold” valve. The principle is that of
secondary emission from two electrodes
under the impact of electrons from a
photo-sensitive surface. This develop-
ment opens up vast new fields for ex-
perimentation.

The use of Ferrocart material for use
in aerial coils, R.F. transformers and I.F.
transformers is spreading in U.S.A. It
may be had either in cores or complete

design, and engineering services are avail-
able to assist receiver or coil manufac-
turers in the design or application of
any unit. The Ferrocart Corporation has
been formed to market the products. It
is high time the material made its appear-
ance in Australia.

An American radio manufacturer turn-
ing out car receivers has resorted to a
rigorous method of testing the chassis
for anti-vibration qualities. Actual road
conditions are simulated by an apparatus
which “jiggles” the entire receiver
1,027,500 times, corresponding to
50,000 miles of road driving. The re-
ceiver is in operation all the time, and
thus it lives a whole lifetime within a
period of five hours. Parts likely to fail
under the stress are shown up, and faults
rectified.

Much experimental work is being done
by 8.8. C. engineers on aerial systems for
Empire broadcasting. Users of all-wave
and short-wave receivers in Australia
should notice an improvement in signal
strength when the tests are completed
and the higher-elevation aerials are in
use.
Casual Comment.
Prince Edward talkie theatre, Sydney,
which recently put on what it described
as “a brilliant 2GB representation,” dis-
appointed a lot of the radio listeners
who went along. They certainly saw
George Edwards, Nell Stirling, Jack
Lumsdaine, Eric Colman and Jack
Davey in the flesh, but the Edwards
thriller was done in pitch darkness, and
the fact that George Edwards assumes
the voices of several characters was made
no more obvious than it is per radio.
Unless the theatre can add something to
a radio show it doesn’t seem good busi-
ness to transfer it to the stage.

An old-time cable telegraphist, who
has recently taken up short-wave recep-
tion via a Wide-World Two, writes of
amateur transmitters: “What with over-
long dots, clipped dashes and rotten spac-
ing (or none at all) most of them are
harder to read at 10 words per minute
than a decent professional at 25.” This,
unfortunately, is true, and a good
operator after many desperate attempts to
copy a “lid” might be excused if rude
enough to ask the offender to take the.
snowshoe off his fist and to unscrew the
key from the ceiling.

Latest in the Trade.
There is always room for improve-
ment in receiver components, and not
the least in need of attention is the vari-
able resistance. There are certain types
of ruggedly designed variable resistances
which, while quite suitable for use in a
part of a receiver circuit where resistance
variation is not likely to produce noise,,
or where imperfectly gradual variation
does not affect reception (as in regenera-
tion control at high frequencies), suffer
from rigid limitations. The new I.R.C.
volume-control potentiometer, now on
the Australian market, is worthy of con-
sideration by manufacturer and con-
structor. .The design takes care of all
high resistance potentiometer short-
comings, and the price is only ss. retail.
The sample illustrated was tested, and
found to possess unique features. The
contact is made by a three-finger arm
wiping over a resistance element, and,
the action being smooth, the variation is
uniform, owing to the compensating
effect of /the three resistance tracks in
parallel. The sample, from the N.S.W.
representative, W. J. McLellan, Brad-
bury House, 55 York-street, Sydney, has
a resistance range of from 0 to 500,000

As an example of the reliability of
the “Chanex Silent,” Australian-made re-
sistor, the one illustrated is outstanding.
This sample was subjected to a 700 p.c.
overload. Three watts is the normal
rating, and the load delivered was 20
watts, with the result that the glass
former melted under the intense heat.
In spite of this heavy overload and severe
treatment, the resistor is still in perfect
electrical condition, and, more remark-
able still, is within its original 10 p.c.
tolerance. Chanex resistors are made by
Ducon Condenser Pty., Ltd., Sydney.
The Q. and A. Column.
I have an Airzone 501 receiver 12 months
old. Already I have had to replace three
valves —80, 47 and 57. Have I been unlucky,
or is there likely to be a fault in the receiver
responsible for valves going so soon ? —ll2.
Valves are not guaranteed to last indefinitely
and there are occasionally cases of premature
failure. However, it is advisable to have the
receiver tested in case any small fault has de-
veloped to overload the valves.
Enclosed is the circuit diagram of a 5-valve
autodyne superhet I have built. Is this circuit
correct with regard to the back-biasing of the
59 valve ? I cannot get any voltage indication
on the voltage-divider, and the electrolytic filter
condenser near the rectifier “sizzles.” —113.
The circuit is correct, but obviously you
have a short to earth which is throwing a heavy
load on the rectifier. The electrolytic condenser
may be suspected, but the trouble may be else-
where. As the 59 is an indirectly-heated valve,
why not use cathode biasing?
Would a condenser microphone (“A.R.N.”
18/5/’34) be suitable for use with a five-valve
superhet, connecting into the pick-up terminals,
as with a carbon-type microphone? —llB.
No. The condenser microphone has a rela-
tively low output, and pre-amplification is neces-
sary.
(1) Of the two short-wave circuits enclosed,
which would be the more efficient ? (2) Where
can I purchase publications of “R 9,” Ltd.
(U.S.A.) ? —ll5.
(1) There is nothing to choose between the
two circuits, as they are both fundamentally the
same. The only advantage of No. 1 would
be that of the grid-leak potentiometer connec-
tion, which would enable the adjustment of grid
potential to a correct value, thus ensuring ease
of oscillation control. (2) Single copies from
Swains, Pitt-street, Sydney; yearly subscriptions
may be forwarded through this office. Sub-
scription is an advantage, including “Radio,”
an American monthly amateur publication, for
the same fee.
I wish to build a B eliminator to supply a
receiver using 201 A detector, first audio and
112/4 output. Is the enclosed circuit diagram
correct, and what would the value of the
resistors be for the voltage division ? —l2l.
Auto grid-bias from an H. T. eliminator.
Your circuit is incorrect. The B positive
is indicated as being taken from the centre-tap
of the high voltage secondary, and the B nega-
tive from the centre-tap of the rectifier filament
winding. These must be in reverse order, the
B positive coming from the rectifier filament
centre-tap and the B negative from the high
voltage secondary centre-tap. The suggested
method of obtaining C bias is also incorrect.
Diagrams herewith illustrate how this may be
done with any B eliminator (or B battery).
The C positive connection will normally be
made from A negative on the receiver. R 1 is
a 400-ohm potentiometer, and the value of
R 2 depends upon the grid bias required for
the valve in use. For a power valve of the
PM22A type R 2 woud be 100 ohms. A voltage
divider with adjustable clips is less expensive
than separate resistors, and this is suggested
for the eliminator.
Where can I obtain Class-3 transformers
suitable for type 46 valves? —116.
Try Keith Jones, Gladstone-street, Bexley,
N.S.W., who manufactures under the trade
name of Gladstone.
The coil specifications for the Wide-World
Two receiver as originally described (" A.R.N.”
26/1/’34) appear to be incorrect for the sC-
to 90-metre coil. The 30- to 55-metre coil has
identically the same specified windings. Which
is correct? —117.
The error was due to a misprint. The larger
coil has 24 turns for the grid and five for the
cathode. See article B. 15/8/’34.
What is the function of the by-pass con-
denser across a cathode bias resistor for auto-
matic bias? —119.
The condenser serves to prevent variation
of the bias voltage. As the bias is obtained
by the voltage drop across the resistor, it
follows that there will normally be some varia-
tion owing to rise and fall of the plate current
with the signal. This naturally reduces the
signal, or amplification. The condenser pre-
vents to some extent this effect, which is
termed degeneration. The charge and dis-
charge of the condenser hold the grid bias
steady, and independent of the plate-current
fluctuations. Thus it will be seen that an auto-
matically biased valve with a small condenser
across the resistance will act similarly to an
automatic volume control.

* I 'HE Australian Banking System is based on the
Scottish model of branch banking, which has
proved its strength and soundness over two
centuries.
"Branch Banking" consists of a few large banks
with many branches. Each of the nine big Aus-
tralian trading banks operates over the greater
part of the Commonwealth.
This system is in marked contrast to the banking
structure of the United States.
In that country there are thousands of purely local
banks, most of them very small. They operate in
very limited territories.
Thus they lack the flexibility of the Australian
system, which can effectively meet a financial set-
back in one part of the country from the resources
of more favoured areas. 'ln Australia, deposits
lodged in well-established districts can be used to
t - ' • • .
finance production in-less settled areas.
But more important still, the centralized control in
branch banking permits of the consolidation of
banking resources from all districts. The prudent
setting aside of large reserves by the Australian
trading banks in 'prosperous times has been the
major factor in maintaining financial stability dur-
ing the past four years.

SPORTING
NOTIONS
Under the Whip
The money came solidly for Whitting-
ham (5 to 1) in Tatt.’s Tramway
Handicap at Randwick, and his backers
should have collected. Commencing
slowly, he was set a huge task over the
last half-mile ; he finished so well that he
would have been in front in another 20
yards or so. As it was, Roman Spear
(7 to 1) struggled home by a head from
Lough Neagh, with Whittingham half
a length away. It was a great trial for
the Epsom, and Whittingham looks cer-
tain to beat those he met in the Tram-
way, though Roman Spear and Lough
Neagh must be respected.
Golden Wings and Cid got into trouble
at barrier-rise. Closing Time gave an
inglorious display, and there does not
appear to be any hope for The Mas-
querader, one of the first candidates
backed for the big spring mile. But
Golden Gate showed pace, and took some
shaking off by Roman Spear, whose: last
three starts have been successful.
Queenslander Brown Paddy, a good
type of Magpie gelding who carries the
colors of H. J. Winten, finished ninth.
He looks in fine trim, and, though he may
not shine in the Epsom, should pick up a
race at Randwick. He was not suited
by the soft going.

Rogilla (11 to 8 on) won his second
Chelmsford Stakes, but Darby Munro
had to ride him hard to beat off Peter
Pan (7 to 1) at the Leger. Peter showed
surprising dash; it was his first run since
the King’s Cup, and he will be in excel-
lent trim for the Melbourne Cup. Glads-
wood (33 to 1) was a fair third; the
Limond—Curtain colt beat the other
Derby candidates easily. The Marne
showed a lot of pace, but seemingly can’t
run more than a mile. Duke Caledon
dropped right out as the race progressed ;
he is a long strider and was bothered by
the going, but is not of much account.
Nightly, who was well backed, trailed
The Marne into the straight, but had
nothing to do with the finish.
Oro (12 to 1) made the rest of the
runners in the Spring Handicap look like
a tired mob of army mules. Keith Cook
was instructed to take him to the front,
and when Oro dashed away six furlongs
from home Jack King advised his friends
that the race was all over. Hunter
White’s big chestnut won, pulling up, by
five lengths from Waikare, with Journal
—second-last at the turn —third. Journal
is worth following. Oro ffas Bst. 61b. in
the Metropolitan ; he finished third last
year. Topical did not start. He is to
run in the Metrop.
Limarch was favorite. He showed no
dash, and merely struggled on to run
fourth. He is favorite for the Metrop.,
but will need to improve a good deal.
Elmaros was doing well at the right end,
and Milantheon—nicely handicapped
now —did well to finish seventh, as he
caught the barrier and was almost down.
Plain-looking Koda Pen (7 to 1) had
a ding-dong struggle with William
Kelso’s Buonarroti in the Welter. The
pair singled out from the field at the top
of the straight; Buonarroti looked as if
he would score when young Weiss pulled
out the whip and the brown shot ahead,
but Koda Pen came again and got the
verdict by a neck. The favorite, Regal
Son, who was ridden a peculiar race, was
third, five lengths away. He came from
the rear, and his finishing effort suggests
that he will be heard of in the near
future. Deputy Ruler, who had been
galloping with Peter Pan, was supported
from 25 to 1 to sixes. Prominent early,
he faded. Johnnie Jason, anchored with
10st. 31b., showed a return to form by
running fourth.
* * * *
Maoriland owners and trainers here
after spring-racing spoils are doing
well in Melbourne as well as
Sydney. At Epsom (Mordialloc), four
of the seven events on the card were
won by horses from the Dominion.
Radiant Star, a three-year-old colt by
Hunting Song—Spotlight, led off by
capturing the first division of the Trial
Stakes. The Epsom Centenary Gold Cup
—a high-sounding title for a race worth
£350, inclusive of the £lOO trophy—went
to Sir Simper, by Grand Night—Simper.
At the close of the afternoon Epigram
(Pom bal—Episode) landed the Epsom
Plate and Irish Chieftain (Chief Ruler —
Sprig of Erin) the Welter Mile. All four
were favorites.
Sir Simper and Irish Chieftain belong
to W. T. Hazlett, member of the executive
of the M.L. Racing Conference; -Sir
Simper, a handsome four-year-old chest-
nut stallion, registered his third consecu-
tive victory. He was handicapped to
carry nearly a stone more than his Caul-
field Cup impost, but the apprentice
jockey (C. T. Wilson) claimed 71b. appren-
tice allowance. Sir Simper behaved
badly at the post, but immediately the
barrier lifted he snatched hold of the
bit and tore down the straight at express
speed on the outside of the field. He
had a clear lead at the six-furlong post
and held control for the remainder of
the H-mile journey, covered in 2min.
Bsec.
Rain had fallen on two preceding days,
but the track could not have been heavy,
as in the succeeding race, the Epsom
Purse, li mile, a course record was
established. Coming from a long way
back, Streperus finished with a remark-
able burst of speed to defeat Gay Girl
by a head for second honors. It was
an impressive performance, but Streperus
will have to meet Sir Simper on 111 b.
worse terms in the Caulfield Cup—con-
ceding 81b., instead of receiving 31b.
Trained by D. J. Price for a Melbourne
barrister, Streperus is the stallion that
was banned from metropolitan racing
for a period on account of wayward
behavior, He has been completely re-
formed, and now stands at the post as
motionless as a trooper’s horse.
Kicks were freely exchanged by can-
didates for the Epsom Gold'Cup. Picatus
received a heavy bruise on the inside
of his off hind leg, and was lame when
he pulled up. This horse went out next
in demand to Sir Simper, but could not
do himself justice. Jack Kelt, his
trainer, did not repine over the money
lost in wagers, but was much concerned
over the gelding’s condition. Picatus
was one of the early fancies for the
Caulfield Cup.
Maybe had almost as many followers
as Epigram in the Epsom Plate, but per-
formed poorly. Ridden right out, Epi-
gram defeated the Westralian filly Gay
Gipsy by a head. He has 7st. 121 b. in
the Caulfield Cup, but does not look
capable of giving Sir Simper 71b.
Radiant Star has 7st. 21b. in both the
Caulfield Cup and Melbourne Cup. A
three-year-old, he might develop into an
outstanding galloper. Radiant Star has
started only twice for as many wins, his
first being in Maoriland as a juvenile in
January last. It cost the well-built chest-
nut no effort to lead practically all the
way on Saturday. He is trained by
Fryer, who was associated with the visit
of Gaine Carrington and Peter Jackson
to Sydney and Melbourne in the spring
of 1932.

M.Q. (and Rafferty) Rules
Gus Sonnenberg defeated Harry
Mamos at Sydney Stadium on Saturday
—his fourth victory in three weeks; on
the Wednesday he had accounted for
Clarke in Brisbane. Far from being ex-
hausted by these exertions, he always
seemed superior to Mamos, and his
back-slam in the fifth round won him the
match. Dawson and Pencheff put up a
lively go at Leichhardt; it was declared
a draw.
Footbrawl
Only one game counted in Melbourne
League on Saturday, and that settled the
positions of the first four —except in the
almost impossible event of Hawthorn
beating Richmond next Saturday. The
meeting of Richmond with South Melb.
drew 31,000 to Punt-road ground, and
they got full value for their tenpences.
Starting off well, South had a four-goal
lead by half-time. Then the Tigers
staged a quarter that rattled the others
and yielded a five-point lead at the last
interval. After that it was thrust and
counter-thrust, and at the end, amid yells
and shrieks, Richmond was on top with
98 to South’s 92. The main factors in
the success of the winners were Martin’s
roving, the steady superiority of their
centres —Geddes, Zscheck and Judkins —
and the absolute reliability of Murdoch
and Sheahan. South held its own at
full-back —Hillis—and with Richards and
Bissett, Pratt found his goal-getting
score restricted to three. Geelong piled
up more unnecessary points—ls 7 to
Essendon’s 41 ; Collingwood got a certain
grip on fourth place by collecting 106
to Fitzroy’s 101 ; North Melbourne
almost reached its first victory by scor-
ing 56 to Carlton’s 58 ; Footscray downed
Hawthorn by 102 to 79 ; and St. Kilda
managed to score 90 to Melbourne’s 88.
Next Saturday’s games will be mere
practices, as nothing, save the unlikely
defeat of Richmond by Hawthorn, can
alter the positions—South and ’Wood for
the first semi-final; Geelong and Rich-
mond for the second. Six points sepa-
rate the lot.

Both Rugby Union semi-finals in
Sydney on Saturday were won by narrow
margins and at the last minute. Both
were disappointing, as is generally the
case with games of this kind. At Manly,
the home side met the premiers, Northern
Suburbs, and for the greater part of the
match found the visiting forwards a
burden, especially in the scrums and line-
outs. Manly’s back division showed
better understanding, but had N.S. taken
advantage of its hooker’s ability the
verdict might have been the other way.
Louden scored for Manly from a
scramble on the line, and Ross con-
verted. Callen crossed cleverly for the
Red and Blacks, and at half-time the
figures were 5-3 in Manly’s favour.
Cowper scored again for Northern, and
the game raged with N.S. a point ahead
until a couple of minutes before time.
Hodgson banged through the ruck and
sent a good pass to Kelaher, who laid
his ears back and went for the line like
a startled fawn. He got there and, Ross
converting, Manly came out on top by
10 to 6.
At Sydney Cricket Ground, the in-and-
out Uni. team gave Randwick the shock
of its life. The Greens won in the end
12-10, but it was so near the end that
the seaside team’s barrackers couldn’t
raise a yell, their throats were so dry.
Uni.’s forwards gave their customary-
good exhibition, and for once its backs
gave them useful assistance. Randwick
backs were standing up on the opposition
and were often offside, but the first p.g.
was against their opponents, and the
Greens were 3-0. This stung Uni. to a try,
and a good conversion by Westfield made
the figures 5-3. Just before half-time, Reg
White, who played a grand game all
day, followed up, took the ball almost
off Westfield’s hands and went over to
make Randwick 6-5 at half-time. Uni.
came again with a converted try, and
was now 10-6. Then White added an-
other try for Randwick and scores stood
at 10-9. With five minutes to go, White
came again, and went down the wing
past all opposition to score his third try.
* * 'i*
The final of the Sydney Rugby League
premiership drew a big crowd to Sydney
Sports Ground to see Western Suburbs
defeat Eastern 15-12 —3 tries and 3 goals
to 2 tries and 3 goals—which just about
represents the difference between the
teams. The game was far from being
spectacular, for both sides resorted to
“spoil-and-spot” tactics for all they
were worth. Scrum infringements were
frequent, and referee Murphy must have
got a sore throat issuing cautions. Still,
the game was hard-fought and exciting,
with now and then a bright flash, as in
the case of Ridley’s two spectacular
tries for the winners. The inside backs
on both sides were allowed little
room to move, and the wingers
had to make their own chances. This
is Western’s second premiership, the
first being in 1930. The game also
marked the passing from big footer of
that great full-back Frank McMillan,
skipper of Wests, who was carried off
the field by his delighted mates. The
shutters will go up on League football
in Sydney with a town-country match
on Saturday at S.S.G.

WoodfulPs Men
The last first-class match of the Aus-
tralian tour —there is a picnic show to
follow at Forres, in Scotland —began at
Scarborough, in Yorkshire, against a
powerful team selected by Leveson-
Gower —“Loosen-Gore” to you, please!
A fixture of the kind has ended the tour
for many years, the former leader of
England being that mighty smiter C. I.
Thornton, who played until anno domini
got too much for him. L.-G. himself
was a fine university and county player
in his day. The Australians batted on
a good wicket, and at stumps on Satur-
day had lost 5 for 442. Brown, Darling
and Wocdfull all failed, but Ponsford
reached 92, while Bradman played ducks
and drakes with the bowling until he
was stumped by Duckworth off Verity
for 132. His score included a six and
24 fours and brought him over the 2000-
run mark in first-class matches this
season. He was the first of the team to
do so, but 123 n.o. by McCabe
raised him to the same proud eminence.
Chipperfield was with McCabe at stumps,
having run up a neat 51. The English
bowling included Fames, Bowes and
Nicholls, all Test-match speed-merchants
this season. Each got a costly wicket,
but Verity (2-83) came off best,

Old-time jockey Chris Moore is dead

Caulfield Cup in 1882. Eleven years later
he got Tim Swiveller first past the post in
the same event, but lost the race on a
boring protest. The Victoria Derby on
The Harvester and wins in the V.R.C.
and A.J.C. St. Legers were among his
many triumphs. In later days he trained

Woodfull’s Men
“Lord Warden”: Rain again ruined
what promised to be one of the attrac-
tive and pleasant matches that mark the
closing stages of an Australian tour of
England. This was against an Eleven of
England at Folkestone, the English side
including Hobbs, Woolley and the ex-
tremely ancient Tennyson, with a good
sprinkling of future Test players of the
calibre of Valentine, of Kent, and the
Cambridge Moslem Jehanghir Khan.
Woolley showed some of his old form
for 66, and Hammond reached 47. Fleet-
wood-Smith took 5 for 137, and had a
much better average until the Surrey
skipper, Allom, showed how to treat his
type of bowling. Allom finished with
47 n. 0., his whack including three sixes
and six fours, all off F.-S. Bowling:
O’Reilly, 4-55 ; Fleetwood-Smith, 5-137.
Total: 279. Australia had lost 4 for 365
when the match was drawn. Ponsford
(45), Brown (73), Bradman (149 n. 0.)
and Woodfull (62 n. 0.) got among the
runs.

The Australian game against the Minor
Counties over two days ended in another
draw. The Counties made 182, Har-
bord, a Yorkshire amateur who occasion-
ally figures in the county’s first XI, scor-
ing a meritorious 104 n.o. Grimmett,
Ebeling, Darling and Chipperfield
divided the wickets. The Australian reply
was 370 for 8 wickets. Top score was 80
by Barnett, with Woodfull 75 n.o. Dar-
ling (59) and Brown (53) also batted well.
The English bowling was colorless. In a
second innings the Counties lost 6 for
137, when time ended the match.

‘Shrewsbury”: The Australians’ two-
day match with the Minor Counties had
this interest for those who know that
many of the men who turned out
on this occasion would, in better days,
have been playing first-class county and,
possibly, international cricket. Most of
them, saving the professionals, who were
few and far between, were university
blues who cannot afford the stagger of
six days’ play a week throughout the
season with no payment save expenses.
A minor county player has, at the most,
three days’ play a week. If he likes to
say “No” to that and look after his
job no one worries. He is asked if he
can turn up next week, and he decides
that himself. The minor counties are
full of talent that should be considered
for an English Test team. Recall
that Maclaren, incomparable judge of
cricket, pulled Syd Barnes out of the
Staffordshire team against all the yowl-
ings of the British selectors and revealed
the greatest English bowler since George
Lohmann.
* * * *
“Bramall Lane”: Bradman’s 149
against an Eleven of England was his fif-
tieth in first-class cricket. Ponsford,
with a four-year start on his mate, has
nicked 49. Woodfull, older in the game
than both of them, has 48 to his credit.
Warren Bardsley, with four trips to G. 8.,
in two of which he headed the averages,
while he was second and third in the
others, still tops the list as the most con-
sistent Aussie batsman. He has 56 cen-
turies on the score-sheet, and Macartney
has 52; but it looks as if the figures of
these great batsmen are going to be as
rain on the river within the next year
or so.
Ht H= * *
“Aigburth”: After all the abuse
hurled at them—and there was a lot that
the average Australian never heard of—
our poor lads of the Australian Eleven
seem to have attracted some attention in
England. Tour profits amount to
£31,000 —a record. The Board of Con-
trol will eventually distribute the
plunder. N. S. Wales, Victoria and
South Australia, the original members
of the Sheffield ring, get 3-13ths each.
“The very first game I ever played, and
now I’ve lost my ball!”
Queensland, the baby Sheffielder, takes
2-13ths, and Tassie and W.A., both on
the outer, 1-13th.
He * * *
“Hopper”: The news that Bradman hit
four sixes off “Tich” Freeman, the little
Kent googly bowler who was here with
Arthur Gilligan’s team in 1924-25, comes
as a mild surprise. No one deals better
with slow bowling than the South Aus-
tralian-to-be, but he used to prefer a left-
hand- trundler when it came, to putting
’em over the fence. Amongst those he
has dealt it out to have been Fleetwood-
Smith, Hunt, Verity and Frank Woolley.
Freeman is a curious bowling proposi-
tion. For years he has put up extraordi-
nary wicket-getting performances in
county matches. Against Australians he
has been hopeless.
Footbrawl
“Jolimont”: It is not only the Vic-
torian V.F.A. which is feeling gloomy
(B. 22 /8 / ’34) over the increasing popu-
larity of “foreign” codes. The League
officials have been pow-Wowing for some
time over schemes “to create greater
interest in the V.F.L. competition,” to
quote one of the local dailies. One idea
is that five teams instead of four, as at
present, be admitted to the semi-finals
and finals. This would extend the
season and, it is hoped, sharpen interest.
As it is, eight of the 12 League teams are
done with for the season, and the four
left will not provide entertainment for
long.
* * * *
“Magpie”: Gordon Coventry played
his 250th match for Collingwood on
September 1. He kicked three goals and
brought his total for the seasons 1920-
1934 to 1066. This stands for V.F.L.
club matches only, and does not include
94 major points in inter-State and car-
nival matches.
He * * *
“Fitzcray”: Melbourne football bar-
rackers have other ways of levelling up
with unpopular umpires than by sticking
them with hatpins or prodding them with
walking-sticks (B. 8/8/’34). One ump.
at a big League match the other day left
his car parked outside the ground. The
local team lost, and the ump.’s decisions
met with some criticism. After changing
in the dressing-room he went out to pick
up his car, and found that some local en-
thusiast had got to it with an axe.
He H< * *
“Basin Reserve”: When the All-Blacks
arrived back in Maoriland, leaving the
Bledisloe Cup behind them in Sydney,
they found another M.L. side all ready
picked to demonstrate that the defeated
ones were the worst team, that had ever
left the Shivery Isles —the usual con-
tention on the other side when things
go wrong in Australia. Though they were
only a day off the boat, the tourists
administered a handsome hiding to the
second team, winning 25-17. Following
on this, M.L. critics have announced
that the standard of M.L.’s play has
slumped badly since 1924. That the
standard in other countries may have
improved does not occur to them.
* * * *
“Stand Off”: Touching that statement
in the Sydney papers (B. 5/9/’34) that
All-Black manager Geddes had referred
disrespectfully to the Australian umpir-
ing in the first Test in Sydney, it is only
fair to say that the official has published
a vigorous denial, alleging that his re-
marks have been “grossly misrepre-
sented” ; he has written the N.S.W.R.U.
officially to that effect.
* * * *
“Precisian”: A rather interesting point
in football law cropped up in Sydney
the other day. The Government depart-
ments conduct mid-week football com-
petitions among themselves. In one
departmental meeting Cyril Towers, the
amateur Union international, was
opposed by Dave Brown, Australian pro-
fessional Rugby League representative.
The very fact renders Towers a profes-
sional under the R.U. laws as to profes-
sionalism. The Union has no power
of dispensation in such cases. But it is
probably content to shut its eyes and
have a quiet snooze, a job it is pretty
good at.
* * * *
“Black List”: It isn’t often the Rugby
Union warns a player off for life. This
happened in N.S.W. the other day when
a player in one of the minor matches
argued throughout the game with the
umpire and finally punched him several
times. There was another case not long
after the war. In this instance the player
was in one of the senior clubs, and his
offence was that he kicked the referee
so brutally from behind when the players
and officials were walking off after the
game that the official was badly hurt.
Year in and year out the culprit applied
for reinstatement, but never got it.
The Nineteenth Hole
H. L. Williams, the young Victorian
left-hander, regained his title of State
amateur champion by beating Mick
Ryan 8 and 6. This is the third time
the pair have battled out the finish in
this event. Williams won in 1931, and
beat Ryan, the titleholder, in the quarter
finals last year. A meeting between Jim
Ferrier and the Victorian in the Aus-
tralian championships at Sydney would
be worth going to see, but there is a
doubt as to whether the Cabbage Gar-
dener will be a competitor.
* * * *
“Divot Digger”: After countless
rumors, for and against, we are now
assured that the team of American pro-
fessional golfers will leave Yankeeland
for Melbourne on October 12. It is
headed by Densmore Shute, winner
of the British open in 1933, Craig-
Wood, who is also in the side, tied
with Shute that year, but was beaten
in the play-off. Harry Cooper is
a mighty hitter, with a leaning to off
days, like most of his kind. Laffoon is
an infant phenomenon, who last season
did some wonderful things in American
golf; Ravolta, one of the original
choices, has dropped out, Louis
Diegel, one of America’s greatest
golfers, taking his place. Paul
Runyan is probably the most for-
midable of the lot. His is a name
to conjure with in Yankee golf.
Of course, Melbourne has fixed
things so that these men will miss
the Australian championships in Sydney.
On their way back, though, they will
have to pass through the Ma State capi-
tal, and if they are not conscripted to
play before being granted a clearance
Sydney has lost its old punch.
* * * *
“Sandringham”: Victoria’s eleventh
country golf championship was played
on the Metropolitan club’s course and
won by S. A. Bradsaw, of Galah, with
rounds of 79-77. Bradshaw, a player of
some note in England, led the second
man by eight strokes, though this was his
first appearance in the tourney and on
this course.
* * * *
Australian golf addicts are tightening
up their belts for the open, amateur and
professional national championships,
which begin at Rose Bay on October 6.
The usual warming-up stroke handicap
will open proceedings, and on the Bth come
the amateur foursomes and a profes-
sional 36 holes of stroke. Next day sees
the . amateur inter-State match, and the
open championship follows on October
11, 12 and 13; four rounds of stroke,
of course. The first 16 amateurs in the
open will tackle 36 holes match play to
decide their title winner, and for four
days from October 15 the professionals
will fight out their battle. There will be

OLDSMOBILE Levels Rough Roads
with “Knee-action” Front-Wheel Springing
glance at the panel below
shows a list of the major fea-
tures that Oldsmobile has for 1934.
These are the features which your
new car must have to be modern
. . . features that have earned for
Oldsmobile the slogan “the car
that has everything.”
Of all these many features,“Knee-
action” front-wheel springing is
worthy of especial note. This fea-
ture of the 1934 Oldsmobile is an
entirely new engineering achieve-
ment which completely revolution-
ises riding and driving comfort.
The front wheel assembly is now
formed by each wheel having its
own individual coil spring. Olds-
mobile’s “Knee-action” wheels are
a basic part of the car design, and
are no compromise of the old type
of I-beam front axle. They are clean
and simple in design, yet provide
advantages in riding and driving
comfort that are not equalled by
any other type of independent
front-wheel suspension.
When you ride in or drive this
car, you will immediately notice
the difference. Instead of rear
pitching and the body jarring,
which is ever present in the con-
ventionally sprung car, Oldsmobile
glides smoothly along, as each
front wheel absorbs the shock of
every bump and hole, and banishes
all jar, bump and bounce. Back
seat passengers enjoy a comfort
inexperienced before.
Arrange to see and ride in this
new Oldsmobile; its beauty is un-
deniable ... its performance
unforgettable . . . and its value
truly unbeatable. General Motors-

on September 18, so hop in.
*** \ *
“Caw Cuss”: As usual, the honor of
opening the golf-ball-stealing season has
been won by a Canberra crow, which
cost one R. T. Whyte a stroke. Rule 17
says that when a ball is “deflected by
any outside agency during the match” it
is a rub of the green and the ball must
be played from where it lies. As the
crow took it to its nest on top of a high
pine-tree, the player has probably re-
signed himself to the inevitable. It is
very difficult to avoid the suspicion that
the Canberra crows began ball-grabbing
just about the time legislators started
salary-grabbing. The crow is a dashed
intelligent creature and quick in the
uptake.
* * * *
“Moore Park”: Though the entries
don’t close for a fortnight or so, those in
charge of the Australian golf champion-
ships in Sydney anticipate a big falling-
off in the nominations from Victoria, the
Cabbage Gardeners having made no
secret of the fact that they mean to sit
tight for the big centenary meeting in
Melbourne. One notable exception is
W. Hope, the Briton who won the Aus-
tralian amateur championship last year.
Business compelled him to choose
between taking time off to play for the
Victorian title or the Australian. He has
sportingly decided to defend the national
championship in Sydney.
* * * *
“Brassey”: In spite of the beastly
weather last Saturday, Sydney amateur
golfers competed for the Cadogan Cup,
Sydney’s most venerable golf trophy,
on the Australian club’s course at Ken-
sington. There were 196 entrants, but
61 of ’em stayed at home. J. R. D.
Scott, an Australian club A-grader, won
off a 10 handicap with a net 73. D. F.
Stewart (22) finished second. The
trophy has, been destroyed by fire a
couple of times, but has risen like the
Phoenix from the ashes. Writer wasn’t
invited to try, but its capacity looks
about two hearty pints.
* * # *
“Fitzcray”: For a long time the Mel-
bourne centenary golf heads have been
angling for Henry Cotton, the first Eng-
lishman for years to win the British open
championship, and probably the best
man in golf to-day. He has cabled say-
ing he can’t spare the time. Tempera-
mentally, Cotton is like Perry. He goes off
the handle sometimes, with the result that
even his fellow-countrymen give him the
raspberry. A notable instance was at
the Southport (Lancs.) tourney last year,
when his failure on the final green was
riotously applauded by the gallery.
* * * *
The American golfers open their sea-
son in Australia at Sydney on Novem-
ber 7 and 8 with a match against N. S.
Walfes. Then to Melbourne for the cen-
tenary open, starting November 15.
Single-day matches in Melbourne follow
until the centenary professional cham-
pionship begins on November 21. A
two-day match against Australia will be
played in Melbourne on November 26-
27, and after a game at Frankston
(Vic.) the tourists go on to Adelaide and
thence to M.L. Queensland has been
cut out, and the bellow of protest is
likely to be deafening.
Racquet and Bawl
“Top Spin”: In spite of the practical
failure of our Davis Cup team in Europe,
officials on this side are already con-
sidering ways and means of utilising the
crocked Crawford and his stale com-
panions for extracting fresh gate-money.
A challenge next year is suggested, though
the outlook is hopeless. There is some
talk also of sending the returning D.C.
team to Japan, a visit having been owing
for years, and it is suggested that a sea
voyage might freshen the jaded players
and bring them back for the gruelling
centenary tourney all bright and shiny.
* - * * *
“Cash Amateur”: Perry has refused
his first definite offer to turn profes-
sional. American promoter O’Brien
offered him £lO,OOO cash down, but the
Englishman couldn’t see it. In the first
place, he said, the British taxation offi-
cials would grab half the brass. Also
he is going to be married, and does not
want to upset his plans. Further, and
an important point from an Englishman’s
point of view, he would cease to be a
member of all British tennis clubs and
any others he might belong to.
* * * *
“Bertha Biffit”: N.S.W. tennis addicts
will have the first squint at the ladies
from England. The fixture between the
English girls and our own is set down
for November 15-16-17 at the Sydney
Rushcutter Bay courts. As Perry,
Hughes, Menzel and Kirby are to
land here on November 17, Ma should
be able to bill a fine array of talent to
drag in the spondulicks.
* * * *
“Vieux Marcheur”: Interesting to
note that Mrs. Gerald Patterson, just
returned from a tennis tour in Europe,
eulogises the wearing of shorts by
women tennis players which is now uni-
versal in Europe, even in the England
which is supposed to be, but is not, far
more wowseristic than Australia. Mrs.
Patterson says that Queen Mary, a model
of the proprieties, never blinked a
winker when Dorothy Round and.other
women champions appeared before her
in the garments. The things have been
banned by the L.T.A.A. in this country,
but it is privately announced that if
no shorts are allowed no tennis will be
played by the tourists. Personally, I
think there is nothing more revolting than
the bare leg of a woman with its
knubbly knees and the inevitable ten-
dency to bandiness that marks the sex.
It is the last thing to attract desirous
youth. In my time the legs we saw at
the Gaiety, the Alhambra or the Aqua-
rium were clothed in judiciously-padded
silk tights, and very often partially
hidden in clouds of lace petticoats.
* * * *
“Canny Lad”: Those Sydneyites who
want to see the English women tennis
players in action next month will have to
dig down into the old sock. Prices are
55., 45., 3s. and 2s. for the first two days
of the match with Ma’s girls. On the
last day you’ll have to cough up 7s. 6d.,
55., 45., 3s. and 2s. Plutocracy is being
specially catered for with chairs on the
green at 10s. a time.
* * * *
“Rev. Knucklebone”: Though the
tennis players approaching Australia by
the western route are being carefully
guarded from reaching N.S.W.—they are
Stefani, South African Malcolm and
Maier —N.S.W. scouts are out to inter-
cept the Japanese team as it comes
down the eastern coast. The Japs may be
too late for the State championships, but
every effort is to be made to wangle a
match with Ma against them before they
cross the Murray.
Miscellaneous
As all on this side expected, Bob
Pearce retained the world’s professional
sculling championship at Toronto with
the greatest ease. His opponent in the
final was the American star Miller, the
two Englishmen, Barry and Phelps, hav-
ing been eliminated earlier. Pearce fin-
ished 15 lengths ahead of the Yank, his
time being 19min. 52sec. for the three
miles.
* * * *
“Backwoodsman”: N.S.W. bowlers suf-
fered a severe loss with the death, at 76,
of their secretary, Walter McLaren, in
Sydney last week, after he had held the
job for 10 years. McLaren was a school-
teacher in many parts of N.S.W. before
taking over the secretaryship in 1924. An
able player himself, he represented the
State several times, and was the most
courteous and obliging of officials and
highly popular with pressmen —which is
not always true of secretaries and other
officials of sports organisations.
* * * *
“Tenth Slip”: The N.S.W. cricket sea-
son opens officially with the Sydney
grade matches on September 29. There
will be 14 rounds in all, the last begin-
ning on March 16. Two days are allotted
to each match. A lot of trouble has
been taken with the draw to prevent
clashes between neighboring clubs, and
clubs with inter-State and international
players have been considered for home
matches on dates when the big men are
not engaged in bigger stuff.
* * * *
“Topping Lift”: The first heat for the
America’s Cup starts at Long Island
(U.S.A.) on September 19. Exhaustive
trials of the three yachts built to defend
the cup against Sopwith’s challenger
Endeavor resulted in the choice of
Harold Vanderbilt’s Rainbow. It is dis-
turbing to read that the American crafi
is being equipped with “all sorts of
mechanical devices” to assist in weighing
and sail-hoisting. At the last challenge
race the American winner did all her
sail-hoisting with gasoline winches below
decks. Lipton pointed out that, as one of
the chief tests of an adept yachtsman is
the setting and reduction of sail by hand,
the use of machinery for the purpose was
anomalous, to put it mildly. It was pub-
lished at the time that the Americans
had promised to forego mechanical aids
in future races.

The Westralian eight-oar
championship was won by Swan River,
which beat West Australian by a length
and a quarter. The winners led almost
from the start, and covered the three
miles in the good time of 17min. 7 3-ssec.
Mick Simmons has issued its cricket
catalogue, and a comprehensive one it is.
The firm specialises in the Stan McCabe
brand of bats, and on his return McCabe
will take up his old role of advising visi-
tors to the g.h.q. of Mick Simmons at
Sydney Haymarket what to choose in
the way of cricketing gear, and how to
employ it to the best advantage.


BUSINESS, ROBBERY, ETC.
Wool Still Down
Sydney wool sales opened on Sep-
tember 3 in a sick-bed atmosphere. All
the industry’s anxious relatives stood
round saying “You’ll soon be better,”
but the patient refused to rally even
under the conventional bleeding treat-
ment which the brokers administered
through withdrawals.
Campaigning politicians seem unwill-
ing to face the situation. So do news-
papers. One city daily for days did not
quote average prices in its main sale
report, though they sometimes appeared
obscurely on the commercial page. Even-
ing newspapers, while prices receded,
almost burst with optimism.
Sydney prices were lower than Bris-
bane prices—they averaged about 10d.,
or £l3 3s. per bale. Best greasy fleece
price was 17d., and average for light
seeded and burred linfis was between lid.
and Is. The offering to Dec. 31 will be
a maximum of 1,350,000 bales, and, on
the basis of withdrawals hitherto made,
all this is not likely to be sold.
Sales last year during the same months
were 1,461,355 bales, and the average
price was 14.65 d. per pound, or £lB 17s.
Bd. per bale. It can be seen that, unless
there is a very substantial improvement,
the sale yield will be at least a couple of
hundred thousand bales short in quan-
tity and more than £5 10s. per bale short
in price. We shall get at least £8,000,000
or £9,000,000 less return for the period
unless prices rise very materially.
If Germany and Italy come into the
market, it will improve, but there is not
substantive evidence that they will yet
awhile. The Adelaide sales weren’t very
heartening.
The Price of Gold
Gold, after touching a record sterling
price, weakened in London towards the
end of last week. It was still over £7
an ounce, however, and well above the
average of the past 12 months. Many
people, with memories of the commodity
booms of 1919 and 1929 and the subse-
quent trade slumps, are nervous about
the price being maintained. Hence com-
paratively small turnovers in gold shares.
Though it may be advisable to dis-
count present metal prices when buying
into gold shows, it is worth while remem-
bering that the yellow metal is an un-
usual commodity. While world trade is
slow to recover, it occupies a particu-
larly favored position. Gold is the
measuring-rod of all values; its high
price in terms of sterling means that ster-
ling currency (paper) is depreciated. A
slump in the price of the metal would
require an appreciation* in sterling and
commodity prices ; there are few grounds
for anything sensational happening in
that direction at present.
The burden of internal debt still
weighs heavily on Britain. Where it
calls for 75 units of goods to dis-
charge a debt in paper pounds, it
requires 124 units to repay a debt of a
similar number of gold pounds. On the
average, a British businessman who bor-
rowed money in January, 1926, when a
certain quantity of goods cost him £156
in gold, could only get 64 golden sov-
ereigns for the same goods to-day. It
is mainly because of the high exchange
rate that many British manufacturers are
at present able to carry on.
The less sterling British exporters re-
ceive for the gold prices of the goods
they sell the harder is it for them to pay
their costs at home. Hence the reluct-
ance of Britain to overvalue sterling (and
undervalue gold) because of the effect
on the export industries.
There is also a possibility that America
will devalue the dollar further. In that
event United States exports will become
stronger competitors with Britain in the
world’s markets, and, within the limits of
prudence, Britain may be forced to push
the pound down in sympathy. If France
departs from gold there may be a rush
of French capital to London; in such a
contingency the price of gold (in sterling)
would very likely weaken temporarily,
with the probability of a sterling value
higher than ever later on.
The thing likely to affect the upward
trend in the price of gold more than
anything would be exchange stabilisation
among the nations. There has been little
or no unanimity on this point so far, and
if stabilisation does eventually come it
will scarcely be on old gold parities.
The Banks
For the first time since 1929 advances
by Australian banks show an upward
movement, the rise being about
£3,000,000 in a total of £249,000,000 for
the twelvemonth to June 30. So great,
however, is the pressure of deposits; —up
nearly 8 p.c. last year—that the ratio of
advances to deposits dropped to 72.4 p.c.,
as against 77, 77.3 and 89.9 p.c. in the
three preceding years.
If every advance creates a deposit, as
the Lang Planners and Douglas Crediters
insist, the banks presumably have nearly
£100,000,000 of deposits created out of
nothing. Anyway, that is roughly the
amount by which deposits exceed
advances. Actually, interest-bearing
deposits—deposits left deliberately for
fixed terms by customers who couldn’t
possibly raise the money on overdraft
at a cheaper rate than that paid to them
—are a few millions short of the amount
out on advance.
The free deposits, which include
undrawn overdrafts and fluctuating credit
balances, were just about offset by Gov-
ernment stocks and Treasury bills, on
which the gross interest earned would
vary between 4 and 2 p.c. Advances and
securities together were just about equal
to total deposits, so that the share capi-
tal and reserves of the private banks were
approximately represented by premises,
cash, bills and other liquid assets at
June 30.
Of the private banks’ total liabilities to
the public, 15.7 p.c. was not invested in
any way at the end of the quarter; it
was held in cash against possible de-
mands by depositors. Bank clearances,
which, when Treasury Bill transactions
are excluded, are a rough guide to busi-
ness activity, were higher during the last
quarter than in any corresponding period
since 1929.
"Free blankets? Mine tinkit this depression great idea for white-pfeller.”
High Cost of Conveyancing
“Fitzwilliam”: I noticed recently a
complaint in The Bulletin as to the
excessive cost of transferring a cottage.
Without knowing all the details, it is
hardly fair to blame either the solicitor
or the scale of charges. I recently had
to arrange a transfer from one brother
to another of his half-interest in a cot-
tage given to both by their father’s will.
Consideration was £l2OO. I had to pay
£lO ss. stamp duty and £9 10s. Registrar-
General’s fees, besides £3 3s. for survey;
total, £22 18s. My own charge will be
£8 Bs., making the bill £3l 6s. I have
no doubt my client will think it exces-
sive.
Recently I transferred a country pro-
perty which included nine conditional
leases. There is no commonsense reason
whatever why one transfer should not
include the lot, but the official mind
insists on a separate transfer for each
lease, and, of course, a separate fee. My
client had to give a mortgage to his bank
to finance the transaction, and nine
more transfers were required. Total
stamp duty on the transfers alone, £2 55.,
and total registration fees, £lB (without
counting the ad valorem duty on the
contract for sale at 15s. per £100). Had
it been a good old-fashioned common-
law title, only one conveyance and one
mortgage would have been necessary,
and the registration fees would have
been £l.
The fact is that our Torrens titles
and statutory systems of conveyancing
are little more than confidence tricks.
They may be a little cheaper for a very
simple transaction, but the moment the
slightest complication is involved our
famous bureaucracy takes a hand ; the
fees exacted are outrageous, and the de-
partmental “requisitions” make it a very
unprofitable job for the solicitor, even
at scale rates.
U.S. Secretary for Agriculture Wal-
lace has been opposing further subsidy
of American shipping—the Matson line
is an example in the Australian trade —-
on the ground that curtailment of foreign
carriage of goods from U.S.A. means re-
duced American exports. Roosevelt says
national defence, preservation of trade
routes and the necessity for lower freight
rates justify the subsidy.
“Brian J”: “Pani” (B. 29/8/’34) is
lucky in W.A. to get off with a mere 600
p.c. additional charge for bread not paid
for on the nail. In Rand wick, N.S.W.,
we pay 41-d. per loaf cash (delivered) and
s£d. booked. If this doesn’t work out
a bit over 1150 p.c. p.a. there’s some-
thing wrong with my arithmetic.
* * * *
“Nippon”: Japan is grabbing the
cheap hardware market previously sup-
plied by Germans. Small tools of trade
are being turned out in tremendous quan-
tities—imitations of English and Ameri-
can pattern planes, small vyces, pliers,
files and hammers. Chain stores purvey
these goods, and also a wide array of
small electrical fittings. I should like to
be able to say that they are as nasty
as they are cheap, but after testing them
in a hard-hearted fashion I have to con-
fess that, for the most part, they’re sur-
prisingly good. Where steel is used it
is of better quality than that put into
English third-rate stuff.
“Questo”: Under Queensland Workers’
Compensation Act it pays a relief worker
to get injured. The Act says compensa-
tion is to be calculated at the weekly
rate of earnings. Although a relief
worker may only work a couple of days
a week he is paid at basic-wage rates for
the period worked, and an industrial
magistrate has ordered compensation at
basic-wage rates. His decision was up-
held by the Full Court An injured man
may now draw in compensation anything
from £2 15s. to £3 14s. a week. His
relief wages range from 13s. 6d. to £2 14s.
* * * *
“Pulex Irritans”: Women and busi-
ness! Put in an hour last night trying
to show the wife, hon. treasurer of a
kindergarten society, how to keep her
accounts. Session ended in a cloudy
acceptance of first principles. Breakfast
brought a tangled statement showing
complete misunderstanding, and to my
“I don’t quite follow you” she floored
me with “No, and I don’t quite follow
myself; but you surely have sense
enough to know what I mean! ”
* * * *
“China Straits” The N. D. Lloyd
is going to reopen its pre-war run from
Hong Kong to Sydney, with Rabaul as
one of the intermediate stops. In the
old days there was a three-steamer ser-
vice, and, since Rabaul was then a Ger-
man port, a concession to the Briton
was made by a day’s stop at Samarai.
They were well-found ships, plentifully
supplied with the beer that was too often
missing from the Samarai pubs and
always good for a gift of ice to the
local nobility and gentry who were
always welcome on board. But they were
subsidised craft, and Australian liners,
like the old Guthrie and Airlie, couldn’t
compete with them and went back to the
Thursday Island route. N.D.L. fares were
so cheap that passengers for Queensland
ports often preferred to go to Sydney,
the first port of call after Samarai, and
take train for home.
* * * *
“Thirkelby”: The granting of a sub-
sidy of three millions to assist British
growers of beef cattle is not working out
as prettily as expected—these things
never do. It was laid down that all
animals, for which subsidy was claimed,
must be tattoo-branded on the ear.
When the first brass was due to be paid
out there weren’t nearly enough tattoo-
ing instruments —supplied by the Govern-
ment—on hand. No attempt is to be
made to grade the beasts: “all fat
animals are eligible for subsidy.” I can
see a lot of queer stuff coming on the
English market shortly and that ought
to help the excellent Australian chilled
beef now establishing itself in Britain.
* * * *
“Barka”: Recent tests of axe-handles
at the Melbourne Uni. put spotted gum
above imported hickory. First-grade
spotted gum was awarded 96 points;
first-grade hickory, 86; second-grade
bluegum. 81 ; first-grade leatherwood,
78 ; first-grade oak,
75. Spotted - gum
handles are made
from timber cut
along the northern
rivers of N.S.W.
* * *
“Smoke - Dried”:
Copra - growers the
world over are hav-
ing a doughy time,
but the stout lads
who carry on in the
British section of
the New Hebrides
are bearing an extra
burden in France —
Marseilles is one of
the world’s most im-
p o r t a n t receiving
ports for the stuff.
The French product
goes in duty-free.
Now France is go-
ing to pay a bounty
on copra to French
producers in the
New Hebrides and
elsewhere.
❖ * *
“Kia-Ora”: Our
Syrian hawker was
after a month’s
credit, and the sup-
plier inquired as to
his profits. “One per
ce n t.” was Ali’s
reply. On being
assured that he
would never make a
success of hawking at that rate, he ex-
plained, “I buy dress from you for £l,
sell for £2 ; one per cent.” He got his
credit.
* * * *
“Eighth Wonder”: Westralia deserves
a bun for a belated discovery. For years
the State sawmills have been selling karri
to three out of the four big railway cos.
in Britain. With all the world to choose
from these railways selected karri as
best for making goods waggons. But—
until a very few years ago Westralia
was importing Oregon to build goods
waggons for its own railways. Thus, whilst
the bulk of English waggons are karri,
the bulk of W.A. waggons are Oregon.
Justice must be done by mentioning that
even W.A. uses karri now.
* * * *
“St. George”: It was a Liverpool
man, Tate, who revolutionised the re-
fined-sugar industry by inventing a
machine that cut the stuff up into neat
little cubes. Before that refined sugar
was sold in large cones wrapped in blue
paper—Light Horsemen will remember
them in the Egyptian bazaars. Prof.
Bayley, of Liverpool Uni., has gone
further: he says he has discovered how
to turn water into sugar. At present the
process is expensive. Queenslanders will
hope it remains so.

And all Branches in City and Suburbs.
Last week the Firm placed Sydney Cri.
at the disposal of the Studio Theatre,
which presented “Macbeth” for two even-
ings and two afternoons to audiences
mostly comprised of high-school pupils.
Considering that most of the cast had
never strutted on a large stage before,
the production was tolerably good. Enid
Lorimer’s Lady Macbeth easily outshone
the rest of the cast. She made the mean-
ing of her lines clear to the youngsters,
and sent them home with the firm con-
viction that L.M. was a thoroughly un-
pleasant woman. Kenneth Fowles, who
was Macbeth, was both letter-perfect and
audible, and put a lot of vim into his
acting, but missed the feeling of some of
his lines. Spencer Teakle furnished a
rounded and likeable study of Malcolm.
Edward Druitt (Duncan), Hereward Rus-
sell (Mac Duff) and some of the others
adopted the sing-song intonation in which
so many amateurs declaim blank verse.
Enid Lorimer was the producer, and Ken-
neth Fowles was responsible for the
scenery and lighting effects.
* * *
The music-loving public loves the rip
and roar, the sensuous richness, the
pomp and circumstance of a full orches-
tra. Trio music, however beautiful and
however skilfully played, is a severely
intellectual thing, and, though there was
a big house for the first Spivakovsky-
Kurtz event at Melb. Town Hall, for the
second concert the vast chamber was in
no more danger of over-population than
the Nullarbor Plain. Moreover, the Spivs,
are fixtures in Melbourne. If they were
fleeting phenomena the public would
chase their flying coat-tails with greater
avidity. The programme was almost
unalloyed delight. The Beethoven Trio,
Op. 2, which critics in 1799 complained
was “unnatural,” appeared quite natural
on Wednesday night—in fact, so simple
as to be well within the compass of the
butcher-boy’s chosen instrument. The
ensemble brought out its melody with
lovely effect. The Brahms Sonata, Op.
5, w'as long and diffused, but Jascha at
the piano made most of it interesting.
Couperin, the seventeenth-century French
composer, reintroduced to the sur-
prised Parisians through Mrs. James
Dyer’s enterprise and cash, was repre-
sented by a delicate suite for ’cello,
played by Kurtz. The last movement,
for some reason or other, is called “La
Chemise blanche.” Tossy Spivakovsky
showed what a number of voices the
violin has in a panel of Schubert,
Brahms and Sarasate instrumental songs.
The third trio concert of the fine series
of five at present being vouchsafed to
Melbourne by the enterprise of the Uni.
Con. brought a fair house to the Town
Hall on Saturday and a living composer,
Maurice Ravel, to the forefront. His one
and only opus in the trio form is remark-
ably free from the characteristic Ravel
note suggestive of taps dripping, and is
freighted with some extraordinarily unique
effects and the loveliest melodies. The
Spivakovsky-Kurtzes brought the craft
into port with all sails set amidst the
thunderous applause of the multitude.
The “Symphonie Espagnole” of Edouard
Lalo had a ravishing andante and a
masterly allegro, and Tossy Spivakov-
sky’s beautiful bowing evoked another
demonstration. Schumann’s “Carnaval”
received just treatment at the hands of
Jascha at the piano, and the evening con-
cluded with some sensitive and sensa-
tional ’cello work by Kurtz, including
Cassado’s “Dance du cliable vert,” a tight-
rope walking act of the first order. There
was to be a fourth concert on Tuesday
afternoon, and the fifth and final occurs
on Thursday.

“On with the Show” will be on at the
Tivoli, Melbourne, from October 13,
entrepreneur Frank Neil having returned
with the last word in modern variety
entertainment after ransacking the uni-
verse. Among the importations will be
English comedian Syd Fields, Jane Ayr
and six other principals. Anna May
Wong, the Chinese film star, will join the
circuit next year. In the meantime, the
Tiv. carries on with Hettie King, Syd
Beck and others. “The Fun Fair” is this
week’s centenary distraction.
* * *
Adelaide Repertory’s latest show is
three evenings of “The Distaff Side,”
Van Druten’s play mainly about women.
Beryl Kook, in the Sybil Thorndike part,
simple and gracious, was effective; so
were Phyllis Simpson and Mrs. Camp-
bell as her sisters, and Ruby Skinner
as the “modern” daughter. Thelma
Baulderstone scored as the domineering
grandmother ; and Florence Brown has
now joined Ronald Simpson as one of
those natural comedians over whom the
audience cackles at sight. It is one of
the best things the Rep. has done.
* * H-
“The Return of the Prodigal,” by St.
John Hankin, was chosen by the Bris-
bane Repertory for its third effort this
year. The Princess Theatre, Annerley,
was packed for two nights. Rhoda Fel-
gate as the devoted and gullible mother,
Jim Felgate as the ne’er-do-well son,
Ludovick Gordon as the father, and
Marjorie Mant as the sister of the prodi-
gal shared acting honors.

Doubts as to whether Ben Fuller’s
collection of operatics would have the
necessary vocal weight for a repertoire
of both Italian and Wagnerian plays have
been set at rest by the signing-on of
Florence Austral. One of the greatest of
living dramatic sopranos. Austral will
sing in “Aida,” “Tosca,” “Cavalleria Rus-
ticana” and six Wagnerian works. She
postponed an American tour to stay in
Australia.
The Palette.
The Society of Artists’ show at the
Education Department’s gallery, Sydney,
gives a sketchy notion of what a really
worth-while exhibition of work by Aus-
tralian painters would look like if in
some future millennium the various
societies should come together. If the
second- and third-rate stuff were cleared
away there should just be room for the
best of the absentees from the show
under review. Dominating the oils is
Lambert’s “The Red Shawl,” a wonder-
ful piece of texture-painting. How the
lady wearing the shawl cultivated such a
giraffe-like neck is something that will
worry the public for years, for the pic-
ture goes to the Gallery. Norman
Carter’s portrait of Prof. Le Gay Brere-
ton is not Carter at his best. Dattilo-
Rubbo gets nearer the essentials of por-
traiture in his picture of Burchell Ben-
bow. H. E. Badham, in “The Afternoon
Caller,” achieves some strikingly realistic
effects by using low tones and throwing
contrasts at them. Will Ashton, Elioth
Gruner and B. E. Minns are represented
by characteristic studies, and Percy Lind-
say portrays quiet scenes in his best vein.
Harold Abbot, one of whose pencil draw-
ings has been bought by the Gallery,
shows a soundly-painted self-portrait in
oils ; Fred Leist breaks new ground in
“Sun Spots,” and John D. Moore lets
himself go in a Gogolish essay in deli-
berate clumsiness called “Resting.”
Among the water-colors are a Norman
Lindsay Oriental extravaganza, “Your
Dream”; some riots of color by John
Eldershaw, rejoicing in the discovery of
Sydney Harbor; some charming colored
drawings of Old Sydney by Sydney Ure
Smith, and a still-life by Vida Lahey,
“Orange Creeper,” which is a triumph
of composition. Maud Sherwood shows
some of her most vigorous pictures, and
Kenneth Macqueen pursues his studies
of the beauty and mystery of the sea
with increasing success. Sculpture forms
an unusually strong section this year,
due to exhibits by Rayner Hoff and Bar-
bara Tribe. The much-discussed centen-
ary plaque by Hoff is on view. Among
the odds and ends are some tasteful
stained-window designs by Norman
Carter and jewellery designed by Rhoda
Wager and Margery Pulsford.
Buckmaster is up for inspection again
at Melb. Fine Arts Gallery. Buckmaster
has no foolish notions about Nature being
a refined and subtle jade. He approaches
the lady in no mood of humility, but
gives her one between the eyes, with the
result that every one of his pictures
seems to say, “I’m a knock-out, am
I not?” This bull-at-a-gate method
has momentary advantages. It over-
whelms the spectator by shock, but
when he recovers his breath and
examines the painting carefully he
finds it has grave faults. Buckmaster’s
planes seldom lie put. They jump about
all over the place. His highlights leave
the objects they are supposed to lie on
and come right out in front.
The exhibition by Colin Colahan
which occupies Melb. Athenaeum in-
cludes portraits of Dr. Gerhard von
Keussler, the musician, health officer
John Dale in a scarlet dressing-gown,
Alfred Hill affectionately contemplating
a violin, Madame Wilkinson in a bril-
liant green jacket, a self-portrait and a
large group dominated by a bright-red
lady. It is difficult to differentiate be-
tween one of these statements of color
except as regards subject-matter, for each
shows the same directness of attack and
sincerity of purpose. Half a dozen splen-
did nudes and some beautiful landscapes
and still-life are in the same category as
the portraits: that is to say, they are
excellent renderings of particular aspects
of the subjects.
A Proper Birthday-
BY “LORD LUVUS.”
COUNCILLOR CAIN and a local
parson have had a difference of
opinion over Melbourne’s approach-
ing birthday spree. The reverend gentle-
man expressed a dread that the festive
beaker proffered by the Centenary Com-
mittee might go to Melbourne’s head.
The councillor not only refused to believe
that Melbourne would do anything to
sully her virginal purity, but scouted the
idea that sophisticated visitors would
lead her astray.
It reminds me of a party I attended
on an island off the coast of Borneo ;
the occasion was the crowning of the
Duke of Gloucester’s father. We hadn’t
, . . _ ,
enough money to inv.te a member ot the
British royal house to our festivities, but
there was a real live sultan available, the
Sultan of Brunei, so we invited him. He
was, according to the dynastic records, a
descendant of Solomon and Alexander
the Great, so we threw in an invite to the
,, , . ... A
od lo y al - We sent a
biassbound launch to fetch them, and
there was a huge crowd on the wharf,
all princes of the blood royal. There
were 700 of them, so we had to take a
junk in tow
T L ora , ’ „ . ,
an awning over the launch,
and the royal umbrella bearer had to
keep the royal parasol over the Sultan’s
head. After several attempts to do this
on the deck, he climbed on the awnine
and spent the time crossing trying to
, , ° y s u
g re t^lc tan s head was under-
neath. Our arrival marked the biggest
population increase in the history of the
island —120 per cent. —and all tfie new-
comers wanted boots. The bootshop
sold out.
The first difficulty was to get the Sultan
up to the Residency for the first official
feed. The Resident’s carriage was in
attendance, but the Sultan had never
seen a horse, let alone an Australian
horse, so the animals had to be taken
out and the vehicle drawn by hand.
There was an overflow banquet at the
Residency, and the cooks had put on a
curry so hot that we suspected them of
republican sympathies. The Sultan and
his court ate the provender with then-
fingers, so, as the Resident had had
orders from the Colonial Office to pay
full regard to native susceptibilities, we
followed suit.
The festivities then began. The Sultan
and his entourage stayed three days, and
during that time the Malays put on
swordfights, cockfights and races; the
Chinese staged better fireworks than I
have seen anywhere and a lantern ballet
on the Residency lawn ; the Dyaks did
a war dance ; the lower deck of H.M.S.
gunboat Merlin produced a nigger min-
strel troupe, and everybody got drunk and
stayed drunk. The final event, a cricket
match between the island and the main-
land, left nothing to be desired in the
realm of vaudeville. All very well pleased
with each other, we saw the Sultan and
his family off and went back to count the
spoons. There were no speeches because
nobody knew enough of the language,
but the celebration is still talked about in
Borneo. That is my idea of a birthday
party—something spontaneous.


NORTH OF
TWENT-EIGHT
“Rufus”: We breed ’em hardy in
Queensland. A three-year-old boy
climbed 140 feet to the top of a derrick
at Dalby the other day before the
startled workmen knew what he was
about. He stoutly declined all offers to
carry him down, and went down the
ladders, the rungs of which are 15 inches
apart, under his own power. The bud-
ding alpinist (2ft. high) is a son of Mr.
Best, the chief driller at the Dalby bore.
The other breaker of records is four-
year-old Gordon Gielis, who goes to
work with his father every morning. The
other day he transferred himself to an
uncle, and, after a trip in that gentleman’s
truck, was deposited at the brickyards at
Newmarket, in the expectation that his
father would pick him up there. Father,
however, had another job; and after
waiting for some time, Gordon walked
six miles home to Burlington-street, East
Brisbane, in less than three hours.
* * * *
“Kaloa”: A Rockhampton Supreme
Court judgment has exploded the old
saying that time means nothing in the
west. One Constantine Horn'-
aids obtained a verdict
against Theo Sklavos, of
Barcaldine, for £97, and to
satisfy it the bailiff pro-
ceeded to sell some property
at Jericho, a junction town
on the C.Q. railway. Theo
then claimed that the goods
had been sold at an unreason-
able price (£7O against £2lO,
which a witness said he
would have offered if pres-
ent) and before the adver-
tised time. The bailiff swore
that he had set his watch by
railway time, but after the
sale he found that the rail-
way clock was three minutes
ahead of the post-office clock.
The jury found for the plain-
tiff. He was luckier than an
early (and involuntary) colo-
nist of N. S. Wales who was
hanged because the watch of
a gentleman who was bring-
ing him a pardon was an
hour wrong.
* * *
“Lugger’s Mate”: In flat-
tening out my claims for
Mourilyan Harbor, “Strand”
(B. 29/8/’34) mislays some of his
own facts. It is not a case of Cairns
versus Mourilyan as a port, but of
whether each port is entitled to its own
trade. That a vessel drawing 28ft. 2in.
recently went up the Cairns channel can-
not be disputed, because the totally un-
expected feat has been sung around the
world by the delighted locals. But prior
to that Cairns had built up a very fair
carrying trade through the made channel
with vessels that can negotiate the
natural Mourilyan Harbor now. Vessels
calling there can go over the bar easily
with loadings of up to nearly 8000 tons.
“Strand’s” objection to the hard bottom
at Mourilyan has no significance. A few
plugs would deepen the entrance perma-
nently for only a fragment of the cost
involved in keeping the soft-bottomed
Cairns channel clear. The Cairns Har-
bor Board has more than once discussed
the chances of digging up the clay floor-
ing beneath the so-called soft bottom
to deepen its channel so as to obviate
the cost of dredging.
* * * *
“Te Babarantiko”: A medico thinks
that Ingham’s mysterious ailment (b.
22 /8 / ’34) is caused by phosphorus rat-
bait laid in canefields. Maybe: but
probably the trouble is in the intensive
use of arsenic to kill Lepidoderma albo-
hirtum, the white grub of cockchafer
beetles —the sugar-farmers’ worst pest.
Sprinkled in the furrows when plant-
cane is laid, arsenic remains in the soil,
ever active. Cane-destroying grubs and
beetles become immune—but useful ibises
and other birds which eat and largely
control insect pests consume the grubs
and their arsenic-laden earth content.
Arsenic might affect men continuously
at work and with feet on poisoned soil.
The present writer has sampled a poison
attack from arsenic fumes in a sugar-
field.
* * * *
“Barambah”: “Murlonga” (B. 15/8/’34)
tips correctly concerning Queensland
Home Sec.’s pious declaration about
the happiness and general health of the
abos. under his department’s adminis-
tration. It reminds me of a certain “Big
Guv’ment” official, well known for his
loquacity, who visited a Queensland abo.
settlement of mixed bloods, and came
back with reports of Colored Brother’s
Arcadian conditions and the absence of
any signs of discontent or unrest. I called
there myself later on; the people were
loud in complaint, and said they’d had
no chance to ventilate grievances. “But
why didn’t you tell Big Guv’ment [Mr.
Blank] while he was here?” I remon-
strated. “Talk along him!” expostu-
lated Jacky. “Why, we been try plenty
time that day, but what chance we got?
He call meeting, and all time his mouth
go, go, all same alligator jaw, making
noise like frog. He blow himself up all
same football, and nobody got chance
for say nothing only him!”
* * * *
“W.L.K.”: I differ from “Humo” (B.
15/8/’34), who says a “boy” will always
“If these blarsted politicians would only work instead of talk, this country might
get somewhere!”
let you down. Also, I dislike the name
“Kanaka.” 1 believe it was first applied
by Bobby Towns to Pacific Islanders
working on his North Q’land cotton
plantations in the ’seventies. Polynesians
resent the term, as nations living on
the shores of the Mediterranean do
the word “Dago.” In my recruiting
days our crews were largely South Sea
Islanders. No finer boatmen or seamen
ever trod deck. Good, cheerful ship-
mates, a little kindness shown would be
returned a hundredfold. Let “Humo”
try the treatment he advocates on, say,
Manus, Murray or Rotumah Islanders,
and, if the breed still runs true, there will
be a position vacant for an overseer
somewhere in the Pacific.
* * * *
“Vic”: The plan now before the Bris-
bane City Council to give Brisbane a
central square will change the whole
face of the city's main business area.
All the buildings between Adelaide-street
and the G.P.O. will be wiped away for
a width of 150 feet, so that the east side
of Queen-street will look straight up an
open space to the Shrine of Remem-
brance and the railway station. Many
an old landmark will be consumed by
this bit of progress —among them the
Royal Hotel in Queen-street and the
former “Daily Standard” office in
Adelaide-street, from the verandah of
which shots were fired when sol-
diery attacked it during the second con-
scription campaign. The only pity is,
since the Post Office is to be rebuilt along
with St. Stephen’s Cathedral, which lies
behind it, that the open space is not
carried through to the river frontage.
That scheme would provide a noble cen-
tral lung which would compare with the
Place de la Concorde in Paris and the
Vienna Rings.
* * * *
“Kai”: More sampans are being seen
off the North Australian coast, and with
them aeroplanes. There have been
rumors of the ’planes for a long time,
and the discovery of clearing work,
apparently for an aerodrome, by a Jap
colony in the Dutch Indies a few months
ago was more than a rumor. There is
not necessarily any food for war scare-
mongers in the reports. The Nipponese
fisheries are among the most modernly
organised in the world, employing vessels
as large as ocean liners and scout ’planes
to discover their prey. It may be, there-
fore, that the sampan fleets are making
aerial surveys of the banks for their own
commercial purposes. The disconcerting
fact is the continued sloth of the Com-
monwealth Government, which seems
willing to let its laws be treated with
contempt so long as the law-breaking
goes on far enough away from Canberra.
It has patrol arrangements in hand, but
it will be months before they are
operating.

“Banty”: “Tripod” (B. 22/8/’34) not-
withstanding, “Beachomber” is correct in
all details. Those glass balls do find their
way up north. I passed one of them last
year between the Cumberland Group
and Cape Townsend ; I could not sou-
venir it. Fishermen at Yeppoon told me
they had three. Where do they come
from?
“Gain”: Brisbane medical authorities
are considering a move to establish a
special hospital to deal with cancer. If
they do, they will earn the thanks of the
specialists and research workers. Even
Sydney, with its much bigger cancer
funds, has no central cancer hospital as
distinct from cancer wards in public hos-
pitals, and, while its radium supply and
its deep-ray therapy plants compare with
the best in the world, it is far behind
other countries in cancer specialisation.
The spread of cancer seems to be beating
the large increase in cures. Special
hospitals, with research laboratories
attached to the treatment department so
that every case may be examined by the
same experts for co-ordination of data,
are first essentials in the war against the
scourge.
“Australia Jane’s” Budget
Dr. Wand, knocking three times at the
west door of St. John’s, was admitted as Arch-
bishop-elect. He was received by Coadjutor
Bishop Horace Dixon and members of the
Diocesan Council. The Bishops of North
Queensland, Grafton, Newcastle and Rock-
hampton and the Archimandrite of the Greek
Church lent color and dignity to the proces-
sion. The proceedings were broadcast by Rev.
Canon Garland, one of the best speakers in
the Church of England, and City Organist
Sampson was at the organ.
Arums and other white flowers decked the
great altar, and were placed in bowls in
various coigns of vantage. In the front pew,
under the pulpit from which Bishop Feetham,
of N.Q., delivered a brief address, sat
Mrs. and Miss Wand, Mis. Barrett, the
Governor and his aide, Captain Pat Honnor.
Immediately behind were Mr. and Mrs. F. A.
Cooper (he represented the Government), Lieut.-
Commander McFarlane in mufti, a dapper
major in uniform (representing the Command-
ant, Brig.-Gen. Ralph), the Chief Justice and
lady, Mr. and Mrs. A. E. Moore and the Lord
Mayor and Lady Mayoress.
The bishops were as gorgeous as birds of
paradise. Their wives were as mild in their
colorings as are the ladies of most bird families.
Mrs. Wand wore a navy-blue foulard, pat-
terned in white, and a hat of cire straw, also
in navy tonings. Miss Wand wore a hat of
oatmeal felt with her brown tailored suit. Mrs.
Barrett was upholstered in saxe blue with a
coin-spot pattern in red and white. The Blair
lady also chose brown, as did Mrs. F. A.
Cooper, and Mrs. Moore was in navy-blue
tailored suit and hat.
While the clergy of the diocese entertained
the new Archbishop at luncheon at the Eton
Hotel, their wives and daughters did likewise
by Mrs. and Miss Wand at the Canberra.
Then his Grace paid a formal afternoon call
on Sir Leslie at Government House; and at
night a huge civic reception was staged in the
City Hall. The Governor, Chief Justice Blair,
Lord Mayor Alf Jones, several bishops, Jus-
tice Webb and the president of the Council
of Churches (Rev. Norman Millar) were among
the speakers.
Mrs. Gearing, who was Bertha Morrison, a
Titian-haired lass with a creamy contralto voice,
is over from Europe. She is Brisbane-born,
and has hosts of friends here. Her hostesses
in Brisbane were Mrs. Espie Dods and Mrs.
Robin Dods. At present she is staying with
several friends near Surat.
Ruth Portrate, who is to take the leading
soprano roles in the Fuller grand opera com-
pany, has left for Melbourne to rehearse.
Agnes Barton has lent several pictures by, the
late Charles J. W. Russell (her mother was the
artist’s niece) to the centenary people for the
exhibition of early-Victorian art. One, painted
in the early ’forties, shows Yarra Bend as few
living Victorians remember it.
All the golden spring flowers, mingled with
bowls of arum lilies, beautified St. Ignatius’s
Church, Toowong, for the wedding of Nell
Barry and Kenneth Paterson. Nell’s father,
Maurice, once was Mayor of Brisbane, and
Ken’s father, F. J. Paterson, has been an
alderman in the Toowoomba City Council
for years, and more than once has worn
mayoral robes. Father Lockington, S.J., tied
the 'knot. Maurice Barry gave his daughter
away, and Barbara Shield was bridesmaid.
The bride wore rose beige, and the ’maid was
frocked in powder blue. O. T. Fenwick was
in the ’groom’s corner. Southern States will
see the honeymoon.
In honor of Fay Riithning, who weds Geof-
frey Alder soon, Ivy Walmsley entertained
many guests at a bridge afternoon. During
afternoon-tea the bride broke open the large
pink bon-bon, filled with gifts, which was used
as a place-mark for her.
Nine species of boronia, gathered in the
Brisbane district, were a feature of the wild-
flower display of the Queensland Naturalists’
Club. Mrs. Estelle Thompson had a wonder-
ful collection, including sun-dew and creeping
goodenia. Some of the exhibits came from
as far away as Adelaide, and there were needle-
bush from Sydney and wild hibiscus from Mel-
bourne.
Norman Ramsay, killed in an aeroplane
crash in England recently, was in the third
generation of an old Queensland family. His
grandfather, Robert Ramsay, took up Eton
Vale in partnership with Arthur Hodgson in the
’forties. Norman Ramsay’s father, R.C., was
a famous cricketer, and holds the oldest air-
pilot’s certificate in England. E. L. Ramsay,
of Cambooya, is an uncle.
T. Ross McKenzie, recently returned from
England, where he won his pedagogy diploma,
is a member of the staff of the Thornburgh
Boys’ College, Charters Towers. He was wel-
comed back by the council of the Presbyterian
and Methodist Schools’ Association at the Can-
berra Hotel. Mrs. McKenzie formerly was
kindergarten mistress at Thornburgh and a past
pupil of Blackheath College, Charters Towers.
The captain, officers and cadets of the Nar-
dana gave a dance at the Carlton Cabaret to
return the hospitality shown them during their
stay in Brisbane. Captain C. Dorkin-White,
assisted by Mrs. A. B. Steele, received the
guests, numbering about 90.
Our Sir Leslie tripped up to Toowoomba
last week to attend the annual military ball of
the Toowoomba R.S.S.I.L.A. The R.A.
Society pavilion was the setting, and ex-Diggers
rolled up in large numbers. The funds go to
help returned men in need. Usually over £3OO
is gathered in each year.
“B. C. C.” in blue, gold and red lights
against a palm background announced that
the City Council staff was holding its seventh
annual dance. The City Hall floor must have
been given an extra polish for this event. The
Lord Mayor and his wife were there, with
daughter Dorothy, and were received by Miss
A. Gralton (president of the dance committee)
and Town Clerk S. E. Travill. Most of the
aldermen and a sprinkling of Ms.L.A. lent the
light of their countenances.

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
The private view of the Society of
Artists’ show was a washout; the
weather saw to that. On Friday every-
one came —private viewers, ordinary
viewers and hordes of Bill Moore’s
friends, for this year Bill got the society’s
medal for his work in aesthetic in-
terests, especially his “Story of Austra-
lian Art,” which is now on the press.
By speech time both rooms were packed,
those in the outer apartment setting up
such a clatter of talk that odds were
700 to 1 against the speakers being heard
in the inner. Here, if the ears weren’t
engaged, the eyes were with growing
azaleas, an Indian rug and Bill Moore’s
striped socks. Dora applauded her Bill,
being egged on by old friend Maud Sher-
wood and others, and bordered her wrists
and throat with white ruchings for the
occasion.
Surgeon McKelvey’s lady’s hat was the
smallest in the room, white with a black
band. Mrs. Feakes’s woollen suit was
worn under a black-and-grey-striped
scarf; novelist Mary Atherton (Mrs.
Worthington Simon), who made up the
trio, wore grey. Mrs. Minns couldn’t get
near Ben’s “Governor Phillip’s Arrival”
for the crowd. Jessica Lee came. Theo
Cowan, Mrs. Alick Joske, Dr. and Mrs.
Wheatley and Mrs. J. J. Rouse walked
in company. Mrs. Victor Conrick was
sleuthing Barbara and Bessie Lane
Mullins through the rooms. Their father,
John, was seen hobnobbing with the
Oswald Pauls. Miss Birkin accompanied
the Mayoral lady. Everyone fought his
way to view Lambert’s “Red Shawl,”
then found his “Tirrana” admirable also.
Mary Doberer, Mrs. E. C. Riddle, Mrs.
C. L. Jones, Mrs. Roger Forrest Hughes,
the professorial T. G. B. Osborns, Gwen
and Jean Ramsay were among those who
heard president Syd Ure Smith suggest
that the public should subscribe for a
new wing at the Gallery to house Aus-
tralian pictures and sculpture and loan
exhibitions.
Nobody was allowed to leave the
1-19th Battalion Ball without hearing the
story of the first volunteer regiment to
be formed in Australia —exactly 80 years
ago. Best girls were piloted up the room
and introduced to the old white ensign,
their escorts pointing out the date of the
first crest, 1854. This and the Union Jack
were presented to the battalion by Lady
Young, the wife of the then Governor,
on behalf of the ladies of Sydney, in the
early ’sixties. Standing between these
flags was the battalion standard, very
grand with its black over green, gold
edging and the rising sun. This was
presented to the battalion by Australian
women in England in 1914, and was car-
ried in France. There were a table of
trophies, a picture of a soldier in the
scarlet uniform and busby of the last
century, and, among the old photographs
on the walls, one of the regiment outside
the Steyne Hotel at Manly.
All this added to the interest of the
night. Major M. S. Hourn was the even-
ing’s host. On his table, among mauve
and pink flowers, the dates 1854-1934
twinkled like beacon lights. General
Rosenthal and his wife came in on the
usual tucket of trumpets and roll of
drums, and the mess call to supper found
every chair filled. The Rosenthal lady’s
black laces were mostly concealed under
a black-and-gold brocade coat. Lupin-
blue laces swirled around the ankles of
Lieut.-Col. Fewtrell’s wife. Mrs. Fry,
who came with her Lieut.-Col., wrapped
herself in a length of Lorelei-green satin.
Noel Narr danced in magnolia satins, and
Mrs. D. Gillespie’s powder-blue chiffons
were served with silver sequins. Miss V.
McEachern’s coat was of pomegranate-red
velvets, and treasurer Miss K. Heame
balanced her budget in white crepes and
a coat of leaf-green taffetas.
Such Old Boys of St. Joseph’s as Dr.
McHardy, Dr. Whittimore, Reg Garner,
John Lawrence, Dr. Mick O’Riordan,
Percy Dalton and P. D. Walsh, to-
gether with hundreds of others, all
with their best girls, rallied to the school’s
colors, cerise and blue, when the flag
was hoisted at Mark Foy’s. The P. D.
Walshes, she in dull-gold satins, did the
honors. Hon. sec. Irene Cusick’s tur-
quoise crepes had silver embellishments ;
her mother’s black velvets swung a
cavalier cape frosted with sequins. Edna
Connolly’s brown and beige laces had a
Paris touch, but her gold necklace
was of Old-English design. Margaret
Walker’s plaid taffeta coat had lantern
sleeves, Mrs. T. T. McMahon’s floral
taffetas were worn under a lipstick-
red velvet coat, and lettuce-green
ruchings ran rioting down the sleeves
and frothed around the hem of Dorothy
Humphries’s black, stiffened organdies.
Here is Jean, eldest daughter of the
T. E. Kennedys, of Vaucluse and of Ken-
sington, Coonamble. For one so young
she has an unusual talent for golf. But
that doesn’t stop her playing a good game
of tennis, and her partners find nothing
to complain of in her dancing. George
Johnston did the drawing.
Looking at the well-dressed crowd that
had been bidden to the C. V. Pottses’
party at the Royal Empire rooms, the
thought arose how many of the shoes,
hats and stockings worn by the women
and the hats and tweeds of the men were
Australian-made. For the party was
given on the day Mr. Potts had been re-
elected president of the Chamber of
Manufactures, and the guests consisted
mainly of those patriotically or financially
interested in the slogans “Buy Empire
Goods” or “Buy Australian-Made.”
However, the flowers —masses of pop-
pies, daffodils and arum lilies —were Aus-
tralian-grown ; the talk was of Australian
interests. Mrs. Potts s blue costume and
daughter Viva’s powder-blue and white
floral crepes were good to look at. There
were cocktails and savories and Gwladys
Evans’s singing and Theodora Stevens’s
playing to cheer the afternoon.
Sculptor Elizabeth McLeish Conlon
and John Dehle slipped into matrimony
at St. Mark’s, Darling Point. Small
Nereida Hoff, in briar-rose pink tulle,
scattered flowers in the pathway of the
ivory-satined bride, and matron of honor
Mrs. Hay and ’maid Mary Williamson, in
amethystine velvets, walked in the wake
of the billowing tulle veil. The bride is
the only daughter of the A. Conlons, of
Hobart and Sydney, and the bridegroom
is the elder son of the G. Dehles, of
Melbourne.
Noorong, the Strathfield home of the J.
Ernest Archibalds, is in the throes of wed-
ding preparations. For daughter Helen,
who celebrated her 21st birthday on the
voyage out in the Maloja, got herself
engaged to Shaen Milward, of Kensing-
ton, on her visit to England for her
presentation at the June Court. But the
romance started four years ago when
Helen was on a trip to Norway. Shaen
is coming out in March to claim his
fair young bride;
then their trunks
will be labelled
London.
Even if you are
going to set up in
private practice, it’s
a wrench to say
good-bye to a hos-
pital where you
have been medical
superintendent for
five years. Dr.
Colin Laverty says
so; so does Dr.
Beryl Plummer,
who has been asso-
ciated with the
same institution of
healing for six
months longer than
that. She is leaving
to become Mrs.
Laverty. The wed-
ding will take place
at St. Mark’s, Dar-
ling Point, on
October 10, and
No. 11 Onslow-
avenue will house
the reception. Dr.
Beryl is a Westra-
lian and a grand-
daughter of George
Clement Gillott, of
Deniliquin. She
graduated in medi-
cine and surgery at
Melbourne U n i.,
and, before coming
to St. George’s, was
resident medical
officer at Wagga
Hospital.
The Eisteddfod has put up its shutters
for another year, and it will take all
that time for the adjudicators and corn-
petitors to get over its effects. At 11.30
p. m . on Saturday Mayor Parker was busy
handing out the cups and whatnots, and
it’s safe to say that neither he nor the
others on the platform yearned to be
up in time to see the sun rise on the
Sunday. At the musical luncheon to
ff* e visiting adjudicators president Frank
Hutchens praised everybody but his
brother Will. Roland Foster then stood
up and said for Will what Frank had
th Hr Rnintnn in
saia tor tne otners. Ur. Bainton m-
eluded his sec., Thelma Houston, and
Margaret Chalmers in his speech, and,
. Muriel rheeke
*7 6
. Marlowe sported a huge bunch of
violets and an extra-big smile on Wed-
nesday when the Women Writers ate a
chop in her honor. There was good
reason for the smile, for the Endeavour
Press had just told her that her “Psalmist
of the Dawn” had gone into its second
edition. When it came to Mary’s turn
to speak she told of her travels; her
ups and downs as an actress and as a
Writer; the kindness she had met with
from pawnbrokers and from people in
the industrial areas; from Mr. Davis,
the Munsey editor, and especially of
the kindness and encouragement the
“Mirror’s” regretted Bert Toy had always
shown to her.
The first social flutter of the newly-
formed Kindred Associations League of
N.S.W. will be a bridge evening at the
Carlton Hotel to-morrow' at 8 o’clock.
Arthur Pixley is the president of the
League; Walter Kingsmill’s lady, Mrs.
Hubert Fairfax, Mrs. J. W. Prentice.
Mrs. S. H. Donnelly and T. A. Nolan
are its vice-presidents, Mrs. Foster
Mattei is its hon. sec.
This federation of the W.A., Tas.,
M.L., Vic. and Q. associations will in no x
way affect the working of the individual
groups. It will only operate when enter-
taining of an outsize nature is contem-
plated—such as the ball on November
23, during the Duke’s visit.
While probably every woman in the
Cri. on Saturday agreed with Grace Lane
that “The Sacred Flame” is a sad theme
and calculated to be a drawer of buckets
of tears, it’s a sure thing that not one
shed a tear. Tears ceased to be great
beautifiers when the make-up box came
in, for they streak the make-up. The
greatest concession made to emotion-
stirred souls was an extra powdering of
the nose and another streak of the lipstick
before going on to dance or to the Aus-
tralia for supper. The night was cold,
so women snuggled down into the depths
of fur collars and coats. Mrs. Sep
Levy’s fox-collared squirrel coat covered
the tops of her ears. With her came
Mrs. Feakes. Brenda Parkhill brought
her mother in green-embossed chiffons
and a floral lame coat. Minnie Love
and her tall husband were in a box. The
Spencer Bruntons, Margaret Allen, J. J.
Mulligan, Surgeon McKelvey, the R. A.
Eakin couple, the Ernest Lashmars, Mrs.
G. Johnston, who rustled in a full-length
taffeta coat, Mrs. Jack Musgrove and
Mrs. Harald Bowden were others whose
sympathies were all with the invalid’s
nice mother and wife, and were pleased
with the nurse’s change of heart at the
end.
The hundreds of cases that are being
delivered at the Trust Building for the
Men’s Hobbies Exhibition have been
keeping both Mr. and Mrs. Stamp-Taylor
up to their eyes in work —worse than un-
packing after moving into a new flat, they
say. Great care has had to be taken in the
handling, as all contain articles of in-
terest and much value to the owner, who
in every case is the maker. The diversity
of things that occupy busy businessmen
and those in the learned professions in
their leisure hours will be seen in L.
Grimist’s point-lace collar, C. W. Mac-
kellar’s 70ft. 40-mile-an-hour speedboat,
John Lane Mullins’s book-plates, Dr.
Temple Smith’s book-bindings and the
inlaid tables of Australian woods and
polished-wood dress buttons sent by
Governor Smith, of the Goulburn Refor-
matory. Acting-Governor Street is to
open the exhibition at 3 o’clock to-day
(Wednesday). Proceeds go to the Indus-
trial Blind Institution.
Mrs. Stassi’s welcome home party for
Mrs. Gariglio filled Farmer’s annexe with
gay frocking, much laughter and a great
deal of chatter. Poppies swayed, white,
gold and choral pink, on platform and
tables. The hostess was clothed in Tudor-
red corded silks, and the returned one in

The Alfred Hospital and the Animal
Welfare League shared profits from the
gymkhana at Moonee Valley racecourse
in Saturday’s sunshine. There was a con-
tinuous programme of equestrian events,
and as a precaution cats were exhibited
as far as possible from the dogs, but a
calamity was narrowly averted when a
bull-terrier tried to swallow a poodle at
one gulp. The fancy-dress dogs were a
huge success. Judith Nicholas won first
prize with her twins, baby Sealyhams
dressed in white muslin and blue ribbons.
Carmen, who made a meal of her red
rose, came second. One pup danced about
in kilties ; another wore a grannie shawl
and coquettish glasses that would slip.
Slim Agnes Connellan, in riding togs which
matched in color her rakish black-and-
white foxy, was the owner of the dog
who looked most like his mistress. The
ditto like his master was a griffin, made
a winner by the muscular facial grimaces
of Norman Mitchell. (There were no
bulldogs or pugs in this event.) Mrs.
Norman Mitchell’s Alsatian was the best-
groomed and -conditioned dog, and Mrs.
David Braham’s cocker won a silver cup
for his soulful eyes. Mrs. Fred Krcrouse
shared the responsibility of deciding the
most cheerful dog ; another knotty pro-
blem was the pup of most doubtful
parentage.
Lady Huntingfield, attended by Colonel
Pott and Captain Barbour and escorted
on a sight-seeing tour by Robert Knox
and his lady, stayed to see the tin-hare
racing which wound up the afternoon.
Sales of flowers, programmes and the
contents of a cocktail bar augmented
profits. Tea could be procured, but many
picnic hampers were opened beside cars
in the members’ parking paddock. One
such party under a budding elm included
Mrs. George Chirnside, the Harry Whit-
ings and several Geelong Grammar boys.
Frances de Crespigny, Jeanne Berry
and June Dyson secretaried a dance in
the intimate little Fawkner Park Kiosk
for the District Nursing Association. In
an ugly men’s competition Dallas Charl-
ton and Gordon Henry ran neck to neck
or ticket to ticket. Each vote, costing
6d., guaranteed the purchaser a thirst-
quencher on the verandah. Mrs. Ted
Dyson unwound the pink-and-blue rolls
of tickets, selling them in twos, until
Catherine Duncan and Clive Turnbull
arrived and bought enough to decorate
their persons with dangling streamers.
Miss Berry clasped pink and blue hya-
cinths to her lavender dress, and Miss
de Crespigny ruffled her neck with black
and white tulle and swathed her hair with
silver. June Dyson had startling beetle
stripes running for a collision towards
the middle of her frock ; Peggy John-
son’s stripes met with an impact of green
and white, the aftermath being a scarlet
sash. Helen Krcrouse was in blue and
green voile. Pat Henry had puffy sleeves
and white spots upon her lilac organdie,
and Greta Harrison slipped her finger
through a ribbon to guide her white satin
train. Ruth McCarthy’s pale-pink lace
foamed about her ankles into an eddy of
pink net frills; her neck was clasped
with a lei of plum-blossom. Bee Wat-
son’s cloud-blue ninon swept demurely
down to the kneeline, where it changed
its mind and burst forth into dynamic
flounces.
Bettine Fisken and Sheela O’Hara
agree that their aunt, Miss A. Fisken, is
indeed a good scout. She gave a dinner-
dance at the Embassy in honor of Bet-
tine’s 18th birthday and as a good-bye
for Miss O’Hara, who is off to England
via China and Japan. The hostess also
returns to London next month. Miss
Fisken did the honors in parchment
velvet and a sequined cape. Bettine wore
her aunt’s birthday present, a string of
pearls with her riot of country gardens
upon a black background. Miss O’Hara’s
cloud-blue was balanced with silver upon
neck and hem. Among the diners and
dancers were Hon. Sara Vanneck, Cap-
tain Lawrence, Janet Landale, Betty and
Guy Pleasance and George Lansell.
Mrs. Stuart Brunton and Gladys gave
a house-warming with cocktails in their
new home in Power-street, Toorak.
Mother and daughter have enjoyed a
prolonged globe-trot abroad, and since
their return have given considerable
thought to the decoration of their new
house. At the party the Gerald Patter-
sons had their hands shaken on all sides.
Major and Mrs. Rupert Fanning, the
Colin Harpers, Dr. and Mrs. Balcombe
Quick, Susan Spencer (N.S.W.), Denis
Sargood and John Howse were a few of
the guests.
Mrs. McCall McCowan and son Sam
are leaving for the other side of the
world. Sam’s parents are educating
their son to be a bonny wee Scot; he’s
a very attractive lad in his kilties. For
the departing traveller the Norman
Barretts gave a late afternoon party
under their Grange-road rooftree. The
hostess, wearing gentian-blue crepe with
a white ripple in its weave, welcomed
many friends, who mixed her cocktails
with Mrs. Stuart Brunton’s, which were
being shaken on the same afternoon.
The “ ’Varsity Rifles” frivolled at No. 9.
In one room there was supper, from turkey
right through to chocolates; in another
drjnks were mixed by the brave and fear-
less, while crackling fires kept toes warm
in between dances. Colonel and Mrs.
Clarebrough were there, she with a long
train to protect and three bracers to sup-
port her turquoise gown. Wing-Com-
mander Harrison brought his wife, whose
shoulders were glittersome with lame
stjtched in green. Colonel Crossley’s
better-half, who wears her hair in a
fringe, was in black and silver. Squad-
ron-Leader Lukis’s wife wore chintz-
patterned pussywillow ; Captain and Mrs.
Ernest Jones were there, she in ink-blue.
Mrs. J. A. O’Brien held up the train of
a smoke-blue garment, and Mrs. G. P.
Fairbairn cherished the delicacy of white

Here is a Broolhorn picture of
Deborah, youngest child of the' late Win-
throp Hackett, of Perth, and of the
Moulden lady, of Adelaide. Miss
Hackett’s marriage in Adelaide last week
with Mac Knox, elder son of Colonel
and Mrs. Knox, of Kent Park, Ferntree
Gully (Vic.) was one of the largest of such
social events any capital city has seen.
Crowds travelled per train and car from
Melbourne for the ceremony, and many
old friends in Westralia were among
guests invited. A flat furnished a few
weeks ago by the bride and ’groom
awaits them in Melbourne.
A beautiful bride who carried lilies
against a wraith of Limerick-lace veil
and ivory satin was Gwen Ogilvie, elder
daughter of Mr. and Mrs. G. P. Ogilvie,
of East Malvern. Following her up the
aisle of Scots Church were Jean Crapp
and Dorothy Anketell, their heads
wreathed in spring flowers and their feet
planted in a page of ancient history, for
their white gowns were worn under
apple-green tunics, short in the front
and sweeping into trains behind. The
’groom who waited was Ted Plaistowe,
of Perth. His mother, Mrs. Hugh Plais-
towe, and sister, Mrs. Dave Freecorn,
came over for the wedding. Rejoicings
happened over a dinner party at Men-
zies, where tables were arranged like a
lucky horseshoe. Afterwards there was
dancing, and still later most of the young
things found their way to the Rex.
People in search of the Findon Har-
riers’ point-to-point, held on the Sten-
ning property, Bournfield Park, came by
all sorts of conveyances—on horseback, in
cars, lorries and sulkies, on bikes (motor-
and push-) and per foot. By a whisker
Findon won the Hunt Club Challenge
Cup from Melbourne, Hylda McCardel
getting home first, with Mrs. Stan Frank-
enberg close behind. Mrs. Frank Dexter,
with Miss McCardel and Mrs. Ken Moore
as second and third, won the Epping
ladies’ point-to-point. Mrs. Moore had a
rough ride on a pounding woolly animal
to win the draught-horse scurry. Among
the onlookers were the Hon. Sara Van-
neck and her guest at G.H., Barbara
Holmes, of N. S. Wales.
Attractive brunette Judy Finch is
marrying into the Navy. Judy is the
elder daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Cecil
Finch, of Caroline-street, South Yarra,
and the man who produced the ring is
Commander James Esdaile, younger son
of the Thomas Esdailes, of Broken Hill.
Miss Finch is one of the Court ladies
who are to dance the minuet in the
Naval Pageant being rehearsed for
November, and Commander Esdaile is
working hard as a stage manager.
There will be a fillip for dancing
schools next year, when, for the first time,
an examiner in dancing, Felix Demery,
is to visit Australia. Here is Eunice
Weston, Australian representative of the
Assoc, of Operatic Dancing, G.B. Her
advice has been sought in the appoint-
ment of organisers in the various capitals
to prepare for the examiner’s visit, and
teachers and pupils in other States will
have the advantage of her personal help
on her summer-schools tour. Before she
came to this country Miss Weston was
for 12 years chief assistant in London to
Espinosa. Madame Genee is her per-
sonal friend. Miss Weston cherishes a
wreath worn- by Pavlova at her last
matinee in Melbourne, but far more
precious is a worn pink satin ballet shoe.
On its canvas wrapping case is a Maida
Vale, London, postmark and the signa-
ture of the sender, Victor Dandre, who
was Pavlova’s husband. The shoe arrived
a few months after her death. It was
a rare gift because, although many
people possess new and unblemished slip-
pers of Pavlova’s, it was not the great
dancer’s custom to give away even to her
greatest friends shoes in which she had
actually danced. Miss Weston’s photo-
graph is by Broothorn.
A Melbourne girl, Guelda Pyke, is off
to Sydney this week with at least one
suitcase which she prefers to carry her-
self. Inside are her masks, packed with
special care: exotic modernisms moulded
in clay, baked and painted— not neces-
sarily with a brush, for their creator can
sometimes get more expression out of
her fingers. Guelda is quite unconcerned
when old-fashioned people who like their
decorations “pink-and-white and pretty”
set their mouths in grim disapproval, for
the masks are quite original and very
sophisticated. Some are passively wicked ;
others look as if they were steeped in
the seven deadly sins and liked it. One
grotesque face wears an impish leer, with
Mongolian eyebrows and a nose which
bears the trace of an enemy’s fist; an-
other with a drooping mouth has a pale
face and green hair. An insipid smile is
contradicted by oiled snaky locks and a
baleful shadow round the eye. Miss Pyke
is always on the lookout for features
with possibilities. On occasions she finds
herself being glared at in trams, and with
a start jerks her eyes away from a face
which she has too noticeably been trying
to memorise.
Three foundlings of unknown origin
were taken to Berry-street last week. The
infant known as No. 3 (her mother failed
to call back for her at a city-store creche)
has set the fashion for the crop of
Marinas which is sure to spring up since
the princess has become front-page stuff.
The nurses determined to devise a really
first-class name, and No. 3 is now Marina
L’Estrange. This christening after per-
sonalities is a dating fashion, for later
on it tends to cramp the style of the
woman of 40 who prefers to be thought
29. Last year’s little Cynthias will never
be able to put over the tall story that
they are younger than this year’s
Marinas.
The Gerald Pattersons, with their small
son and daughter, returned from five
months of travel through America and
England. They watched all the Davis
Cup matches, and danced, dined and
lunched at many social functions which
revolved round big tennis at Wimbledon.
Mrs. Patterson considers that shorts are
the most suitable wear for women tennis
players. Abroad they are so cleverly
pleated that they look like skirts, and
their length is about six inches above
the knee. As the favorite color, white
still reigns supreme.
Lecturer from Cardiff University Mary
Martin has been lured to this country
by the peculiarities of our flora and
marine animals and plants. She will
climb over the Barrier Reef and visit
Tasmania before going back to her job
in Wales, and she might make time for
a look at the particularly noisome species
of algae whose home is the Swan River.
Miss Martin has an air-pilot’s license.
The Duke of Gloucester will need the
breathers he is to be allowed on coun-
try pastures. On Cup Day, November 6,
his programme is to snatch his bacon
and eggs and breakfast coffee at 8 a.m.
At 9.30 he will visit the Anzac Hostel
at Brighton, then go to meet the Diggers
at Caulfield. Back to G.H. for a change
into clothes compatible with a bell-
topper, by car to Flemington, transfer at
the entrance gates into the State carriage,
and progress with pomp and circum-
stance down the track. There will be a
formal welcome by V.R.C. officials, who
will sigh with relief when his Highness
is safe and sound in the special box.
They will give him luncheon and hand
him the glittering Melbourne Cup for
presentation, and produce the winning
steed for a word and a pat of praise
from royalty. The day finishes with a
dinner and dance at Govenrment House.
The ’flu wog has arrived. Consequently
eyes are watery, noses are flushed a pale
beetroot, bones are aching and tickling
throats give rise to a chorus of grave-
yard coughs. Last autumn when the ’flu
family was particularly active we heard
the cheering news that the National I'n-
stitute of Medical Research in London
had captured a virus, and by studying
its habits, inhibitions and reactions was
hopeful of exterminating the whole tribe
by chemical warfare. An ominous
silence during the last six months gives
rise to the gloomy thought that the cap-
tured wog was either killed by too much
attention or it escaped.
A couple who have discovered that
their matrimonial as well as their pro-
fessional tastes run along the same lines
are Dr. Sheila Peters, younger daughter
of Mr. and Mrs. V. Peters, and Dr. A. H.
McGregor.
The Centenary Club has blossomed
forth into an eyrie of its own, where the
afternoon sunshine of Elizabeth-street
creeps through gold curtains above the
Block Arcade. At the opening tea party
members were so appreciative of the
cushions stitched by an energetic sup-
porter that not one of the orangy chair
accessories was squashed through being
sat upon. Other things which came in
for admiration were gifts of a clock, tea-
time china, the kitchenette and the
pleasant surprise that someone had paid
two weeks’ rent of the new rooms. The
Queensland Bureau and Mr. Clapp sent
down pictures to decorate the walls.
The venerable pile which is G.H. has
made the acquaintance of the late-after-
noon party. Mrs. Helme Pott was hostess
of the largest social occasion which has
happened under the v.-r. roof since the
Stonehavens departed. The building has
lost its seclusion. With the fence pushed
back to enlarge Alexandra Gardens, the
lodge at the entrance of a comparatively
short drive and the demolishment of
many trees, the stone mansion with its
shrunken lawns and multitude of win-
dows is visible to the public eye. For
her party Mrs. Pott pinned a spray of
orchids to the shoulder of her sand-crepe
frock. Lord and Lady Huntingfield were
away on a country trip, but the Hon.
Sara and the Hon. Anne Vanneck helped
their aunt entertain. Hospitality offered
was of the refresher variety usual to the
cocktail hour, and the guest list was
highly social.

Percy Marks doesn’t find the black
opal unlucky. His allegiance to it has
never swerved for one moment ever
since as a very young man it came under
his notice. He even staked out a claim
and delved into the earth with pick and
shovel to find it, so fascinated was he
with its beauty. The difficulties he had
to face were many before the stone of
his delight was recognised. Jewellers
refused to handle it, fearing it might upset
their trade in established stones. So
Percy presented the gem to people known
by all the world, among them Sousa and
Melba. He took it to England, and
through the help of the Princess of Pless
got one brought to the notice of Queen
Alexandra. But Court etiquette wouldn’t
let her keep it. He then put it in the
Franco-British Exhibition in 1908, and
called it the Queen’s Stone. It was
bought by a member of the aristocracy
at a big figure. Then the vogue started.
Mr. Marks’s gifts to French museums
were rewarded by his honorary appoint-

THE LITTLE SISTERS.
SOUTH AUSTRALIA.
A great social event was the Knox-
Hackett wedding. Women came from
miles round, and it took a squad of police-
men to keep the surging mass in bounds.
St. Peter’s was decorated in gold and
white. The eight bridesmaids, in silver-
grey crepe, with crimson velvet sashes
and mitre velvet caps to match, carrying
each a sheaf of crimson camellias, pre-
ceded the. bride, who walked up
the aisle followed by the little train-
bearer, Virginia Deeley, also wearing
grey and crimson relief. The bride was
gowned in white satin with a silver-
thread stripe. The long train from the
shoulders was of silver lam 6; her Honi-
ton-lace bridal veil, 300 years old, was
held in place by her mother’s diamond
tiara, and she carried a sheaf of white
camellias and lilies-of-the-valley. The
Moulden lady, in a black satin ensemble
and large white hat, gave her daughter
away. Bridegroom Macpherson Knox
had Alistair Mackinnon, of Melbourne,
as best man. The bride, Deborah, is
the youngest daughter of the Moulden
lady and of knight John Winthrop
Hackett, W.A. ; the bridegroom is the
elder son of Lieut.-Col. G. H. Knox, of
Kent Park, Ferntree Gully, Vic., who
was in Adelaide for the wedding. Two
of the bridesmaids, Beverley Lansell and
Diana Knox, were from Melbourne, and
cousin Betty Drake-Brockman came from
Perth. The others were Phillippa Mc-
Farlane, Nan Gosse, Margaret Davis,
Lesley Bowman and Betty Burston.
There was a reception afterwards at Lor-
dello, North Adelaide.
. For the Uni. Dance Club’s flutter the
refectory was massed with almond-
blossom. Dr. and Mrs. Rex Matters
received the guests, the lady in flowered
marocain with cape effect.
Betty, third daughter of Wallace Bruce
and his lady, announced her engagement
to Robert Fowler, of Kew, Vic., son of
Mrs. R. W. Fowler, of Roseville, Sydney,
at a sherry party at Medindie, at which
Betty and her brother Kenneth enter-
tained their friends. The Bruce lady
was smartly gowned in black chiffon
velvet, and the bride-to-be looked charm-
ing in an ice-blue floral taffeta frock
with angel sleeves. Mr. Fowler had
arrived that morning from Melbourne
on a brief visit. A dinner party at the
St. Vincent, at Glenelg, followed.
Nan Gosse gave a sherry party to
announce her engagement to Lieut.
Maxwell Hole, eldest son of Mrs. C. M.
Hole, of Artarmon, Sydney, and the late
Lincoln Hole. Miss Gosse is the daughter
of the late Major and Mrs. W. H. Gosse,
of Illawong, N. S. Wales.
News comes from North Rhodesia
that Mrs. Norman Kater (Margot Milne
that was) has shot her first lion, and is
now pursuing elephants on the banks of
Lake Tanganyika.
Mrs. H. B. W. Wynyard was hostess
of a party at the South Australian to
welcome Mrs. H. H. Dutton after an
extended trip abroad. The drawing-
room was decorated with flowers, and
afternoon-tea was served on a balcony
enclosed with flags. Mrs. Wynyard’s
black romaine was worn with a large
black hat. Mrs. Dutton’s navy ensemble
with snow-leopard collar drew cheer
from a red blouse.
WESTRALIA.
Commander and Mrs. Griffiths-Bowen
started the naval entertainings with a
dance at the Freshwater Bay Yacht Club,
where the outlook over the waters made
the officers of the Canberra and Aus-
tralia feel at home. A diamond pendant
swung above Mrs. Griffiths-Bowen’s
black lace and georgettes, which had
sequin and bead flowers at the shoulder
and hip. Daughter Betty shared the
honors of the hop, winging an openwork
sequined butterfly as the back of her
ice-blue pebble crepe gown. Judith Bird-
wood was there, trailing misty-blue
flowers on her navy chiffons; Peg
Watson-Williams wrapped a pleated
neckwarmer over her Patou pinks; Jean
Lang sent a myriad red-green-and-mus-
tard cylinders chasing down her silk
crepes.
Karrinyup Country Club made the
next effort for the brassbuttons. The
crowds who had lined the fairways dur-
ing the afternoon to follow the ama-
teur championship finals applauded
Reggie Forbes’s victory at the 34th, then
dashed home to change into their pret-
ties. Nancy Parker’s green satin skirt was
semi-hidden by a Russian tunic of silver
lame ; Joyce Burridge’s short white gloves
attracted attention to her black lace
and taffetas; Margaret Walsh studded
white matt crepe with green beads;
Dorothy Kirby outlined white satin with
wispy, black monkey-fur, and Betty
Wood wore lame with silver-and-green
stripes.
Naval and military uniforms ran fifty-
fifty at the R.A.A. Ball at the Artillery
Barracks, Fremantle. Major and Mrs.
Meredith (her blue taffetas gleamed
under a cloud of net) dined the bigwigs
first, then led their guests to the halls set
aside for dancing. Brigadier Martyn
escorted his black-lace-clad lady ; knight
Talbot Hobbs brought his better-half and
daughter Betty; Major and Mrs. Athol
Hobbs were there, and three of the
Forbes sisters, Hetty and Nancy in black
and Dorothy in moonlight blue ; Mrs.
Conrad Chase chose self-patterned blue
satins, and Eila Vincent clamped rows
of pearls around the throat of her white
crinkle crepes.
The Repertory Club wore “The Mark
and the Face” of C. B. Fernald for a
four-night Country Week season, with a
change of curtain-raiser each night by
the mother society and three of her affili-
ated country chicks. Secretary Cyril
Riley made his first W.A. appearance as
Count Mario. Bea Hassen’s softly -
appealing Savina was clothed in a rapid
succession of enviable gowns.
A school of black cats ran riot through
the Pleiades Club during the annual
dance. They swung from the canopy of
black and white streamers, squatted on
the artificial stone walls, swarmed up
the pillars in the ballroom and stood
guard over the supper in the dining-
room. President Mrs. Norton, set about
with sea-blue matelasse and silver lame,
received the guests, whose identities were
hidden ’neath masks.
The Hobbs lady gave an afternoon
party to farewell Lady Birdwood, who
left for South Africa by the Cathay with
Sir William and daughter Judith. The
guest of honor’s black costume, with its
hint of green, was piloted through choice
roses and sweet-peas to a table resplen-
dent with golden poppies, where the
hostess poured tea in flowered wine silk
crepes.
The P. U. Henns are to lose both their
chicks from the nest. Mary announced
her engagement to Alan Kopke, of Car-
narvon, and Jean followed suit by play-
ing hearts to a lead from Bob Hodge,
R.A.N., son of Dr. and Mrs. Theodore
Hodge, of Derby.
TASMANIA.
Lady Clark patronised the original-
song competition afternoon at the
Lyceum Club, when a long programme
of local efforts was gone through, Mrs.
Lucie Benson coming off winner with
her “Love Ballad.” A big roll-up of
members and guests filled the rooms.
Hobart Phil, gave “Elijah” at the
Royal, with Horace Stevens, an old
friend of Tasmanian audiences, as the
prophet. Though the cold caused some
involuntary tremolo effects in some of
the singers, the oratorio went well. Other
soloists were Doreen Bidencope, Freda
Elliott and Mr. and Mrs. Leo Fisher.
The junior branch of the A.W.N.L.
celebrated its third birthday at the
League’s room. Mrs. Mary Parker was
on the dais, and cut the cake at supper.
Mary Fox, headmistress of the Laun-
ceston Methodist Ladies’ College, enter-
tained her predecessor, Mrs. L. Russell,
B.Sc., who came from Melbourne to be
present at the school’s annual dinner.
To raise the wind for the J. C. Hogg
Endowment Fund for the Launceston
Free Kindergarten, Mrs. P. C. Smith,
Mrs. J. D. Millen and Mrs. G. H. Hogg
engineered a big afternoon and evening
bridge party at Mrs. Smith’s home.
Dining-, drawing- and smokerooms were
filled with tables, and a considerable sum
was realised.
Mrs. Ewart Hart (Ruth Patterson that
was) has settled in Launceston. Mrs. G. H.
Hogg gave her a welcome party, at which
the guest of honor sported a blue turn-
out, and the rooms were a mass of choice
spring flowers. /
Both the attractive Davern girls have
lost their maiden names, Mollie having
married Lieut. Bernard Phelan, while
Nora has been annexed by Anthony, son
of John Wren, Studley Park, Vic.
Artist F. F. Rowntree, who has been
in the Cold Country for a year’s study,
has brought back a good amount of
work, chiefly sketches made in quaint
Yorkshire villages.

BRIDGE
WITHOUT
SIGHS.
It’s Like Fishing.
BY DR. H. L. TONKIN.
Pleasures akin to those of angling
may be enjoyed at the bridge-table, just
as the angler picks the pool for his cast,
the calculating player reviews his hand,
dissects the bidding, and chooses the right
situation for his misleading bid. As the
fisherman flicks his fly on the surface
the bridge bluffer carefully names his
bid. In both cases the bait is dangled
before the unsuspecting prey. If the fish
is hooked it is played ; even so the bridge
hand is delicately treated, and the result
on the score-sheet represents the landing.
One of the early deals in an important
match played a little while ago is an
excellent example of angling for a
double. Here are the hands:
North dealt, and neither was vul-
nerable.
The Bidding.

North has a fine opening, and, with any
forward bidding from his partner, would
look for a game. East, though not
powerful, must get in a call cheaply.
South has his strength concentrated in
one suit.
This type of holding is definitely
attacking. It is unsuited for defensive
play, particularly for penalty doubles,
yet South is not justified in calling more
than two clubs.
Now we come to the angler, West.
He sees that he can support to three
spades and that his partner may contract
for four. But with North’s opening bid
and South’s interpose it does not seem
that four spades can be made. The
opponents are just bidding strongly
enough for him to chance a semi-bluff.
He casts his fly with a bid of three
hearts. Coming up to North, this looks
like a misfit in the East-West hands, and
with three top cards, plus a calling
partner, three hearts should be defeated.
North made a rather sporting double.
Round to West again, he made his
second cast, and the fish was hooked.
West’s three spades appeared to North
nothing more than an attempt to get out
cheaply, as West had failed to find a fit
in hearts.
The fact that, owing to peculiar distri-
bution, East-West are able to procure
four spades does not detract from the
merit and subtlety of West’s three-heart
bid. The inexperienced player, when
up against opponents known to be
versed in the tricks of the game, must
be on the lookout for these positions.
This type of calling is known as the
shift raise, and the attempt to coax a
double is made when the shifty player
judges that the opposition is too strong
for his side to make a game.
False-carding.
It has been said that false-carding in
defence is the hall-mark of an imma-
ture player, but the remark should be
amended to read “habitual” false-card-
ing. When one is declarer, of course,
one can play the cards in any order
desired, but when defending it is im-
portant that no play be made which is
likely to deceive one’s partner. As a
rule, the weaker the hand the more par-
ticular one should be in giving partner
a chance to “count it.”
A situation in which the novice thinks
it is obligatory to false-card is where he
is holding king, queen over dummy’s
ace, knave, ten. It is evident that the
declarer will take the double finesse.
Almost invariably the young player will
win the first trick with the king. Reason-
ing is all against this being a successful
line of play. It is the sort of thing the
declarer expects. Consequently, the cor-
rect way to cause a doubt in his mind is
to win with the queen.
A dangerous and irritating player is
the one who regularly false-cards on his
partner’s lead. This sort of thing is never
seen in good-class bridge, because it
destroys all partnership morale and loses
dozens of games which might be saved
by proper play. This deal is an illustra-
tion which might well be kept in mind.
With South as dealer, the bidding pro-
ceeded through spades, clubs and no-
trumps to a contract of four spades. If
you look over the hand closely you will
see that it cannot be obtained by reason-
able defence. Also that there is no
means by which the declarer can deceive
the opposition and give himself a chance.
Four spades can only be procured by
bad play on the part of the defenders,
and consequently should be defeated.
West led the diamond seven. North
(dummy) played the three; East, the
clever false-carder, put up the queen
instead of the knave. This loses the
game. After the diamond ace won, three
rounds of trumps are played, leaving
West in the lead again. He, of course,
places declarer with knave of diamonds,
and, holding another trump trick, the
only thing he can do is make his diamond
king in case a discard may be taken on
dummy’s long clubs. He leads the king
of diamonds, the knave falls from East,
and the game is gone. If East plays
correctly to the first trick, West can lead
a small diamond, knowing where the
queen is. Nothing can then save the
declarer from the loss of another trick,
which defeats the contract.
Progress in Melbourne.
Melbourne took up contract bridge
seriously at least a year before Sydney
did, and excellent clubs flourish there:
Collins-street alone has six or seven.
Hugh Joske, a member of the Victorian
team which visited Sydney last Decem-
ber, is running Bridgehaven, and here,
as one would expect, a very high grade
of contract is the rule. S. Sergeant has
opened a beautiful modern club at
St. Kilda. Both captain teams occupy-
ing forward positions in the Melbourne
Pennant Competition.
From the leading fours in this com-
petition will be picked the Vic. team to
meet N. S. Wales in Melbourne during
the centenary celebrations.
ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS.
J.O. (Artarmon, N.S.W.). —Don’t see
any reason why a particular race should
excel at card games. No doubt one sees
fewer bad players among the people you
mention, but it is questionable whether
they supply an undue percentage of the
world’s leading exponents.
A.M. (Brisbane, Q.). —Thanks for in-
teresting note ; hope to put one or two
problems of the type which will illustrate
some particular point of play.
O. (Wellington, M.L.). —In time an
Australasian contract championship will
no doubt be staged. Six nations competed
recently in a European championship.
J.McC. (Dubbo, N.S.W.).—The 1934
Blue Book is as good a textbook as you
can get, especially if you prefer some ex-
planatory remarks.
P. (Orange, N.S.W.).—The hand
quoted was played in a rubber game
actually seen. It certainly displays some
clever counting and deduction on the part
of the declarer, but would not be re-
garded as uncanny among first-class
players in good form.

Whaling' for Pleasure.
WITH the nations of the world
struggling for supremacy in the
whale fisheries, and spending huge
sums outfitting whaling fleets, it is a sad
commentary on our national initiative to
think that when a whale recently de-
livered himself, bound hand and foot so
to speak, in Sydney Harbor, there was
no one wililng or able to exploit him.
True, the cap-
lain of the Manly
ferry showed
some imagination
in ramming the
monster, but this
was apparently
more or less un-
premeditated.
But when next
day, polite and
obliging even in
death, the whale
returned, the un-
imaginative
authorities twice
towed it out to
sea, leaving it a
prey to the scav-
engers of the
deep. With the
persistence of an
opera star giving
farewell concerts
it twice returned.
Then The Bulletin, pursuant to its
policy of encouraging Australian indus-
tries, commissioned Frith and The Psy-
chologist to visit Botany Bay and report
on the possibilities of the creature from
the point of view of whalebone, Roman
candles, cod-liver oil and ambergris.
“Claimed it in the name of The
Bulletin.”
The Navigation Department was com-
municated with in order to find out the
latest whereabouts of the cetacean.
“About that whale,” said The Bulle-
tin.
“What wireless?” asked the Head
Navigator brightly.
“Not wireless, whale.”
“Oh! whale. You’d better ring the
Harbor Trust. They’re handling the
whale.”
The Harbor Trust was non-committal.
When last heard of the whale was at
Botany, and no further intelligence could
be released until after the next board
meeting. Was the whale approachable?
Well, yes, provided you kept on the
windward side, and got acclimatised at
the tanneries on the way.
The expedition set out for Botany.
Frith was anxious to take a harpoon and
flensing knives, but on being reminded
that the creature had been dead several
days he satisfied himself with a bottle
of smelling salts and some eau-de-
Cologne. The Psychologist took the
office umbrella for prodding purposes,
and a book entitled “Whaling for
Pleasure and Profit.”
On the way down they discussed ways
and means. Complete measurements
would be taken, and an estimate pre-
pared of the number of barrels of oil,
buckets of whalebone and tubs of amber-
gris the corpse would yield.
Presently Frith remarked that they
seemed to be getting close. It was only
a tannery, however. Several tanneries
and soapworks later they arrived at the
scene of the investigation. Forcing their
way through the crowd they reached the
stranded monster and claimed it in the
name of The Bulletin. The whale
“The captain showed some imagination in ramming the
monster.”
showed no sign of appreciation, nor of
any interest at all in the proceedings,
although his presence did add a sort of
antique flavor to the scene.
Two small boys who had apparently
been masquerading as owners up to this
time withdrew hurriedly, and a fox-
terrier which had been trying to drag
the whale ashore by the tail slunk off
guiltily.
The monster was a sorry sight. The
Manly ferry’s autograph had been signed
with a firm hand, and the sharks and
killers had also left their cards.
The investigators conferred. The text-
book laid it down that the measurements
must be taken from head to tail.
Although the tail was intact the head
was entirely missing. The book made
no provision at all for such a contin-
gency. Obviously it was impossible to
measure the monster without its head,
and without measurements accurate esti-
mates were impossible.
The next best thing was to sound the
opinion of the crowd. The wind was
blowing in fitful gusts and the crowd
ebbed and flowed between the whale and
the sandhills at frequent intervals. Frith
and The Psychologist, as became the
claimants of the derelict, stood their
ground alongside their prize, fortified
with smelling salts. During temporary
lulls in the breeze several old whalers
gave their opinion of the catch. The esti-
mates differed considerably, but appar
ently at a conservative reckoning there
would be enough cod-liver oil to ruin
the home life of a fair-sized country
town, and sufficient whalebone to supply
corsets for all the women North ot
Twenty Eight.
“Borrowing a pair of scissors from a
lady.”
This seemed fair enough, but the am-
bergris question still remained unsolved.
The shellbacks shook their heads.
‘‘Tricky stuff, ambergris,” they said.
“Y’ might get it* and then again y’
mightn’t. It all depends on the whale.”

That ugly mask creeps over teeth and robs them
of all sparkle—discolours them with stains
from food and smoking—finally destroys them.
FILM is a dull, dingy coating on your
teeth. And it’s that film—and
nothing else—which keeps your smile
from gleaming like your favourite
movie star’s. That’s why your most
important beauty treatment is to
remove stained, ugly film from teeth
effectively—and safely.
Film is the greatest single source of
most tooth trouble. Film forms on teeth
in coats—stubborn, clinging. It is laden
with acid-producing germs that dissolve
the tooth’s enamel. It can lead to many
serious disorders. Hence, removing film
effectively, and at the same time safely,
is the object of all scientific tooth pastes.
How safe is it?
A revolutionary cleansing and polishing
material is contained in Pepsodent that
removes film— differently. This material
polishes away stained, unattractive film.
PEPSODENT
the special film-removing tooth paste
MADE IN AUSTRALIA
Then it polishes tooth enamel to new
and brilliant lustre. And, above all, this
new cleansing-polishing material is abso-
lutely safe . . . safe because it’s twice
as soft as that in common use. It is by
far the softest used in any leading tooth
paste. That’s why Pepsodent is safe for
children as well as for adults.
It is the newly-discovered polishing
material that makes Pepsodent so differ-
ent from all other tooth pastes. If you
would have Pepsodent results you must
use only Pepsodent to get them.

Frith had read somewhere that the
best way to get ambergris was to tickle
the whale’s throat. That was partly the
idea of the umbrella, and as an addi-
tional aid he had bought a couple of
apples with which to tempt the beast.
"Told to remain there until ten o’clock!”
But here again their plans were frus-
trated. Even if you have six umbrellas
and a whole case of apples, you can’t
tickle a whale’s throat if the throat isn’t
there to tickle. It looked like a case of
no throat, no ambergris. Then one of
the anqients spoke up, and said he’d
always heard that the ambergris was
under the whale’s 37th vertebra. Hopes
rose again, only to be dashed once more
to the ground as The Psychologist, prod-
ding gingerly with the umbrella, ascer-
tained that this particular whale pos-
sessed only 36 vertebrae.
The investigators decided to call it a
day, but at this moment someone re-
marked that whales were a wonderful
cure for rheumatism.
“All y’ have to do,” he said, “is to cut
a hole in the whale and crawl inside.
After a few hours the pains all goes
away an’ y’re cured.”
Neither Frith nor The Psychologist was
afflicted with rheumatism, and no one
else seemed anxious to try the cure, at-
tractive though it sounded. At length
a small boy came timidly forward and
asked whether it was any good for warts.
Frith assured him that it was practically
the only cure known to science, and the
lad eagerly agreed to the experiment.
Borrowing a pair of scissors from a
lady who had brought her sewing with
her, The Psychologist deftly cut a hole
near the midrib of the whale, and the
boy inserted a warty hand into the cavity.
He was presented with sixpence and a
couple of apples, and was told to remain
there until 10 o’clock the following
morning.
The investigators then bade farewell
to their helpers and walked away.
Presently Frith ran back and offered his
smelling salts to the patient. The lad,
however, with that sturdy self-reliance
which always marks the Australian in
such circumstances, waved him off (with
the hand that held a rapidly-vanishing
apple) saying “Gosh! Haven’t I got
enough here to smell already?”
Next morning Frith and The Psycholo-
gist returned to Botany. As they drew
near they had an uncanny feeling that
all was not well. The air seemed too
thin.
They reached the spot.
The crowd had gone. The whale had
gone. Botany Bay was very much as
Captain Cook had found it, except for
the presence of a small boy who was
gazing out towards the Heads. He turned
as they approached, and held out a
warty hand towards them.
“Nice doctors you are!” he com-
plained. “Why didn’t y’ stop ’em?”
“Stop who?”
“The whale had gone ."
“The tugs. They come and took me
whale away, and there was only half an
hour to go. I’m goin’ to stick to thistle-
milk in future same as I cured me others
with.”
Blood Royal.
BY E. MARY GURNEY.
WRAITH, the little white thorough-
bred mare, toiled at a dogged
run up the steep slope. The mist
was so dense that she could not see a
length in front of her. Sweat streamed
from her heaving flanks. Her nostrils
were flared with the laboring of her
breathing. The terrific beating of her
own heart deafened her.
But she could still feel the whip that
cut her side at every stride, so that near
the summit of the hill up which she
labored blood began to mingle with the
sweat.
On the peak of the hill something
snapped in her brain.
She had toiled up unfaltering under
the goad, but she would not, could not
go down.
There on the summit of the mist-
shrouded world would she break or be
for ever broken.
It was an unequal battle, with the cards
all dealt to the man, by iron and bit and
whip, by weight and wickedness. Yet
the little mare held the last trump.
Rearing, plunging, kicking under the
ceaseless hail of blows, she came nearer
and nearer to the steep drop that fell
away from the opposite side of the peak.
Her mouth brutally torn, her flanks
cut to the bone, so that all feeling for
the time was gone from them, she fought
on with the same dogged determination
with which she had breasted the slope.
Fought until her legs gave under her,
and she floundered to her knees. She
struggled to her feet and stood for a
space of seconds staring away through
the parted curtain of the mist towards a
distant peak where, caught in a vagrant
shaft of sunlight, a horse and rider stood
silhouetted against a background of dun
mist.
Without pause the whip rose and fell,
but Wraith seemed not to feel it.
Head up, eyes wide, proud and un-
tamed, she sent a wild call singing across
the valley.
Then the curtain of the mist closed
down again, cutting her off from the
world, wrapping her again in her own
terrible isolation.
For the time it takes to draw a breath
she stood quivering, and then, as she let
the breath go in a long-drawn sigh, she
whirled and bucked once. Bucked as she
had never bucked in all her life —not
even when the power of youth and glory
were in her. Bucked with all the wild
savagery of her untamed hatred ; and
the man left the saddle like a sped bullet,
up and out and over her head ; over the
sheer drop that fell away from the peak
of the hill.
With her fore-hoofs braced on the
crumbling edge, Wraith managed to stop.
She was jerked precariously forward as
the man’s weight bore down on the reins
he still clutched with a drowning man’s
despair.
Sobbing, desperate, the little mare
flung herself backwards ; sank, shudder-
ing, to her knees, and rolled over on to
her side, with her beautiful little head
dragged out over the crumbling cliffs
edge.
The dead weight tore the bit through
her mouth, so that the cheek strap slid
through and cut her mouth to the bone ;
but her weight held the weight of the
man ; would hold it, though she died.
Below them, deadened by the pall of
the mist, the eerie silence was broken
by sudden sound, the muflfled drumming
of the hoofs of a hard-ridden horse.
Then a man’s voice, gentle but urgent,
cut crisply into the runnel of sound.
“Stick to it, boy! Get to it! This
isn’t play!”
A snort answered him, and out of
the mist a big bay horse leaped, swerved

away from the prostrate body of the
mare and plunged to a curveting halt
beside her.
His rider swung from the saddle and
ran to her, kneeling beside her head and
gathering the reins into his hands to
ease the"'pressure that was slowly chok-
ing her.
Then he spoke again, in tones as curt
and bitter as the bitter, clinging mist.
“Well, Avery?”
Below him, the man gasped in a terror-
strangled voice:
“You! Bronze! For God’s sake pull
me up!”
“I’ve a damned good mind to cut the
reins!” retorted the newcomer savagely.
“You’d be lucky, maybe, if I did! ”
“I can’t hang on much longer! Pull
me up!”
But Bronze, holding the reins with one
hand, with the other lifted the lid from
the mare’s closed eye.
“The mare’s dying,” he retorted
harshly. “I’ll pull you up when you put
a price on her.”
“Fifty pounds!” gasped Avery.
“Twenty —curse you! Pull me up!”
Bronze swung on the reins—swung
the man’s huge bulk over the edge, and
stood up, looking down on the prostrate
form as a clean man will look on a
foul thing.
“Take your hands off the mare!” he
commanded harshly, for Avery lay hall
across the beast. “Get up, and get out! ”
Avery got up, still grasping the mare’s
reins. He jerked them, eyeing Bronze
cunningly. Wraith sighed and struggled
to her feet, her eyes wide and blood-
shot with hate and exhaustion. She
swung round, standing beside Bronze, as
though in him she recognised a friend ;
and Bronze dropped his arm over her
neck and caught the reins by- the bit.
“Let her go, you swine! She’s mine!”
Avery blustered, his sly eyes fugitive
with defiance and cunning.
“For fifty quid! You told me she was
dying! And you lied!”
Bronze did not move. Only his lean
face went curiously still. So still that
Avery curled up, shrivelling with the
savagery of his fear. Clinging to the
reins, he babbled incoherently. “For
God’s sake, Bronze! I—you know I’m
joking! I—twenty pounds, of course!
I —l’ll send her to-morrow.”
For answer, Bronze whipped out the
sheath knife that hung at his hip, and
severed the reins close to the bit.
With a little whinny that seemed like
thanks, Wraith plunged away and went
leaping down the hill through the thin-
ning mist.
The bridle was on her head and the
saddle still on her back, but, for the
moment at least, she was free.
Down in the valley bottom she
stopped, seeking a place where she might
roll. First the bridle went, and then
the saddle, mangled and broken beyond
repairing; but, days later, Raymond
Bronze gathered them up and sent them
back to the man he hated only one
degree less than that man hated him.
Freed of the trappings of her bondage,
the little mare moved on, on dragging
feet, searching for water. She ached in
every limb. The blood still oozed from
the cuts in her flanks. Her mouth was
foul from the saltiness of the blood from
her torn and blistered mouth.
It was evening before she saw Bronze
and the bay horse again.
Through the red dusk they came swing-
ing over a hill and down to where she
stood shivering in a valley bottom.
Cold to the bone, exhausted, in agony
with her sides, and her mouth that made
it impossible for her to eat, she per-
mitted man and beast to come right to
her side.
In a few weeks her adventure over the
hill was no more than a vague and bitter
memory, vague as the scars on her hide.
She lived in the pasture where the
stables were, for Raymond Bronze,
though he owned a farm, kept horses
there. Thoroughbred mares mostly ; and
the great black blood stallion whose pro-
geny were racing him into fame —and a
reputation for savagery that was not alto-
gether merited. Proud he was, and
highly strung, and so was his get; but in
the hands of those who understood them
they were never savage. Only harsh hand-
ling roused their haughty spirits to an
active, untamed resentment.
Wraith, as yet, had had no acquaint-
ance with the big stallion. None, that is,
except for seeing at times his - splendid
head poked out of his stable door; be-
yond hearing him snorting and scream-
ing with the sheer joy of. living.
At nights, when they were quiet and
still, he would rage round his big box,
his nerves strung taut as fiddle strings,
with the memory of things that his wild
forebears had known.
Wide plains and high hills. Lost winds
that sang. Moons grown old with de-
sire. The spring of turf beneath racing
hoofs. Wild things, ecstatic under the
night.
But it was long before she took to
answering him. Her vitality seemed gone.
It would come again, perhaps; but,
watching her, Bronze was filled with mis-
giving.
There were moments when he doubted
that he would breed from her even.
Not that he grudged the money spent
on her purchase. To save her from that
hell he would have bought her for twice
the sum. But having her there under his
eyes it had been brought home to him
that out of her mating with Whirlwind
something unusual would be born.
So when, as the weeks wore on, she
suddenly took to answering Whirlwind’s
midnight extravagances, he was well
pleased. In spring his hopes might be
realised after all.
When the big stallion raged and called,
she would come, light-footed as her
namesake, soundless and eerie, to stand
beside his box, shivering with wild
ecstasy.
There came a night when a big owl,
sitting in silent contemplation on a post,
whirled up swift and indignant as the
shadow of a man detached itself from the
shadow of a tree and began to move
stealthily towards the stablfes where
Whirlwind was working round to his
nightly restiveness.
Snorting, the stallion pawed up his
bedding ; swerved, reared, squealed.
The upper half of the door swung open
silently, letting in an icy breath oi air
and a faint gleam of light.
Whirlwind, with a snort of delight,
flung himself forward, striking the lower
door squarely.
Before the impact it, too, swung wide.
Whirlwind squealed, rearing against
the great bar that traversed the door-
way.
Up the paddock Wraith answered him
with a little uncertain snort.
Whirlwind squealed again, playfully;
and a stone hit him squarely in the chest.
It did not hurt; but he was a blood
horse —a royal horse.
The playfulness went out of his squeal-
ing. Between him and the yard was only
the great wooden bar that traversed the
doorway.
Another stone struck him on the side
of the neck, and he screamed with
sudden rage ; flung himself upward, rear-
ing. Kicked off with his mighty quarters
and went out in a long, low leap into the
yard.
Stone after stone struck him, stinging.
Foaming, raging, he plunged round and
round the yard.
From the rails above him a man’s
low laugh, jeering, malevolent, arrested
his attention.
Neck arched, ears pricked, he raced
for the sound, rearing towards a shadowy
form, more sensed than seen.
It vanished ; and its vanishing was fol-
lowed by a muffled thud and muffled
cursing.
Up the pasture Wraith squealed sud-
denly, stood shuddering and trembling,
seized with a sudden ecstasy of fear and
excitement.
Avery, rudely dislodged from his seat
on the rails and lacking the nerve to
return, moved over to the shadow of the
stable and stumbled over a tin, which,
grinning evilly in the darkness, he began
to kick against the wall.
If that din did not rouse Bronze, no-
thing would!
The moon, grinning too, came up
over the hill.
And Bronze came, with startling sud-
denness, out of the shadow of the trees
that surrounded the house.
Avery stopped kicking the tin, and,
still keeping in the shadow of the stables,
leaned over, fumbling with the heavy
gate of the yard, round which Whirl-
wind still raged and squealed.
Bronze came on, calling to the beast:
and Avery, keeping behind the gate,
swung it wide.
Whirlwind, screaming and bucking,
tore out and up the pasture towards the
calling man.
Avery, crouched behind the gate,
laughed aloud.
“Steady, boy!” he mocked. “Steady!
He came out from behind the gate
and stood, sick and shaking and drunk
with his triumph, to watch the beast the
man loved batter the life from his body.
“Steady,” said Bronze, coming on
steadily himself. “Steady, boy!”
Whirlwind raged up to him ; reared,
towering above him ; pivoted, swinging
away from him.

Cleanness"
explains Dr. F. de COURMELLES
—of the Paris Society of Practising Physicians and Surgeons.
DO YOU suffer from every ailment that happens? Have
you constipation, indigestion, gastritis, rheumatism,
neuritis, backache, weakness of any organ, catarrh?
Do you get frequent headaches, catch cold easily? Is your
appetite poor—vitality lacking? These and many other ail-
ments are caused because you unconsciously permit poisons
that bring on disorder and disease to remain in your system.
m
SELF-POISONING-the basic cause of
most ill-health
The modern refined foods we eat
do not stimulate the "bowel
muscles to sufficient action. No
matter how regular your daily
habits, particles of food waste be-
come encrusted on the walls and
crevices of the intestine, and breed
germ - producing poisons which
enter the blood-stream. These
poisons undermine your health—
taking power from the life-giving
organs of nature —making you old
years before your time. It is this
condition of SELF - POISONING
or autoxima that physicians de-
clare to be the basic cause of most
ill-health. Self-poisoning is all the
more to be dreaded because it is
?o insidious —you suffer, but do not
imow that this toxic condition is the
cause of your sufferings.

THE SCIENTIFIC WAY
to keep your body internally clean
Modern medicine has formulated
a preparation specially designed to
combat insidious self - poisoning—
COLOSEPTIC. This effective inter-
nal cleanser softens the hardened
particles of food-waste and sweeps
THE GREATEST BENEFIT
I have used COLOSEPTIC regularly now for the
past six months for Stomach Troubles, with the
greatest benefit. And I have also been the means
of many others trying it with equal success. It is
a wonderful remedy.

matter right out
of the system—
without pain or

Taken regularly, COLOSEPTIC
tones up the whole intestinal tract
so that the "bowels function natur-
ally and regularly. By its action
on the kidneys, the pores of the
skin and the respiratory tract—
Nature’s other outlets for the dis-
posal of bodily impurities—
COLOSEPTIC cleanses the polluted
blood-stream.
DRINK COLOSEPTIC EVERY
MORNING
Wash the peut-up poisons from the body.
Internal cleanness will alone bring you
back the joy of perfect health. Drink
COLOSEPTIC in hot water every morning.
COLOSEPTIC increases the secretion of
the gastric and intestinal juices—improves
vour digestion and brings back your appe-
tite. It combats lassitude, fatigue, “blues”
and other symptoms of self-poisoning.
Gives you, instead, the sparkling vigour
of youth, glowing eyes, clear complexion
and a new outlook on life.
Start a course of COLOSEPTIC to-day

The great stallion struck the turf
savagely, rearing and screaming, but
never once offering to touch the man
he trusted.
For some seconds Avery watched,
eyes narrowed, jaw ludicrously fallen,
Bronze came on, quiet and unfaltering,
with the stallion circling him, following
him; hating something ; mad with the
desire to kill ; baffled, because there was
nothing present but this man, whose
hands were instinct with love.
Cursing, incredulous, Avery dropped
on the ground, grovelling there for some
missile with which to drive the sanity
and uncertainty from the big brute’s
mind.
In ghostly silence the little white
mare came galloping down the paddock.
Light as thistledown, her little hoofs
skimmed the turf.
Behind her the moon laughed, fling-
ing her shadow grotesquely before her.
The stallion's calls, his actions,
breathed of the primeval urge—the urge
to kill; yet there was nothing to kill,
She curveted again, answering his
snorts, and under her very feet some-
thing writhed, screaming.

Pimple’s Elixir.
BY ARTHUR W. UPFIELD.
WHEN Pimple brewed his famous
elixir he was cooking at Deep-
water. Well, situated midway
between the homestead and the out-
station of Nonning-Nonning. A young-
old man with an inventive brain, he lived
in a world of his own ; and, because his
culinary labors were limited to feeding
Silent Joe and me, he could devote much
time to his experiments.
Silent Joe, too, lived in a world of his
own. There was small chance of being
entertained or bored by his recitals of
voyages to the nearest pub, twenty-odd
miles distant, for he could not talk, had
never talked, and found me obsti-
nately backward in learning his finger
language. Hence, we three —two stock-
men and the cook —lived in peaceful
relationship for several years.
For eighteen years Pimple had been
cooking at Deepwater Well. The camp
comprised two pine-built huts, set close
together and joined at both ends by walls
of canegrass to keep out the duststorms.
Pimple’s occupancy of the kitchen-dining
hut made it definitely his. Attached to
it was a lean-to shed housing his private
electric-lighting plant petrol-engine,
dynamo and storage batteries.
Pimple was fresh-complexioned, sandy-
haired and blue-eyed, slight of frame
and flat-footed from wearing slippers. A
lifelong succession of boils had earned .
for him his nickname. He never went
away to see his relations ; never went as
far as Flanagan’s Hotel on the river;
it was whispered that he feared meeting
with a wife who was after him for
alimony.
All his wages went into patent medi-
cines, electrical appliances, books and
gadgets. The mails came irregularly, yet
every one contained parcels for Pimple,
and the junk stored away in his hut
must have cost hundreds. One mail
would bring him a book on wireless and
a manual on card tricks ; another would
bring electric bells and wireless parts and
gramophone records.
What with Pimple’s several gramo-
phones, the wireless and the station
telephone, life was not as dull as might
be imagined. Pimple would invite any
passers-by in for a drink of tea and for
news of Dead March Harry, Larry the
Liar and Henry the Eighth. They, of
course, roamed up and down the river
with the timetable regularity of mail-
boats.
Strangely coincident, the boss once
brought out two petrol-cases filled with
grapes and a mailed book for Pimple
called “Fox’s Twenty Thousand Recipes.”
It being February, we had ceased to
-regard grapes as a luxury, and, this being
so, it seemed natural for the homestead
gardener to send out two more cases of
grapes the next day by the> station truck.
“Wot in ’ell are we gonna do with
’em?” Pimple demanded when I got back
that afternoon.
“Make a pie or something,” I sug-
gested.
“Pie, me neck! Even the fowls are
sick of grapes. If that yaller-faced
baboon ’ud sent out a bag of oranges
■l could have made some ginger marma-
lade with some synthetic ginger I’ve got.
Drink of tea on the stove.”
The fact that Pimple delayed the an-
nouncement of a drink of tea being on
the stove proved his mental perturba-
tion. Always was this sentence the first
to fall from his pink lips on one’s return
from the paddocks.
I stepped into the kitchen, whereupon
a bell rang, and a wall-indicator showed
a figure 1. The door would have
automatically shut behind me had it not
been wedged open to let in the air.
There, at one end of the hut, was
Pimple’s private stove, with the steel
plate-racks over it. Beyond the table, on
a long bench, were the wireless set, one
or two gramophones, a washing-machine
into which you stuffed your moleskins
and then turned down a switch for
sixty-five seconds, and various boxes
containing an extraordinary array of
patent medicines, with which he was
everlastingly trying to stop the boils on
his neck and the bunion on Silent Joe’s
foot.
Two electric bulbs hung from the
rafters. If you went out through the
back door the bell-indicator showed
2, and should you then enter the
dynamo-house it would show 3. Pimple
was rigging up wires to connect
with the ball-valve of the horse-trough
to make the indicator show 4. For
many months he had been nutting out
a gadget to shut off and put on the mill
over the well by pressing a button at the
head of his bed. Some day Pimple is
going to be world-famous, tor he has
courage of a high order. When a course
of patent medicines fails to give Jesuits,
he will not hesitate to try a mixture o
several and make his own estimate oi

thousand recipes, Pimple epl ed
am t looked at it yet properly but it te s
you how to make anyth,nk from a ha..-
dye to a permanent soap bubble.
The bell rang when Silent Joe stepped
on the doorbag
“Billy on the stove,” Pimple said,
becoming normal.
Silent Joe grunted, and made for the
billy. His drooping moustache reached
his wishbone, and his washed-out grey
eyes revealed a state of perpetual sandy
blight which Pimple with all his arts
could not cure. Having cooled the tea
in the pint pannikin with a dash of water
from the hanging canvas bag, he grunted
again and clicked his lingers.
“Yes, Bill brought two more cases ol
grapes,” Pimple explained, understand-
ing the deaf and dumb signs. “Wot are
we gonna do with ’em?”
Silent Joe shook his head, giving his
attention to the book of twenty thousand
recipes. I was about to retire to my
bunk, when the speechless one again
worked his fingers with lightning rapidity.
Looking at Pimple, I watched a beatific
smile born on his youthful face.
“Give us the book!”- he cried. I
waited. Pimple read avidly. “Crummy!
That’s a good idea, Joe,” he said, look-
ing up at Joseph. “The problem of them
grapes is solved. The book says —wait a
moment —it says smash up the grapes, let
’em stand for a night, wring the juice
through a dishcloth, add four pounds of
sugar to every gallon of liquid, skim over
twenty-four hours, and then bottle.
That’ll do! I’ll make champagne outer
them grapes.”
His eyes were alight with a great en-
thusiasm. Silent Joe’s tongue licked his
grey moustache as a cat licks its
whiskers after a drink of sweetened
powdered milk. The silent one’s watery
eyes went dreamy.
In course of time, Pimple filled twenty-
seven beer- and whisky-bottles with
grape-juice, and he and Silent Joe spent
an hour lashing down the corks with tie-
wire and string. We all swore an oath
that not one bottle would be broached
until the lapse of six weeks.
The maturing wine was carefully de-
posited under Pimple’s bunk, that being
deemed the safest place—from Silent
Joe. When Pimple became interested in
the manufacture of synthetic petrol from
mill oil, he quickly forgot all about the
new wine in the old bottles.

Not so Silent Joe. He brooded on it.
He lost all interest in the sporting papers.
Then he lost his appetite. Next he com-
plained of griping pains, and signalled
Pimple his opinion that they were due
to the intake of dust raised by the suc-
cessive sandstorms. Pimple gave him
some Black’s Gripe Relief, but it didn’t
live up to its name. Then the sufferer
suggested that what his stomach really
wanted was a little something to warm
it. It was a tragedy that the pub was
so far distant. He wondered if a little
of the grape wine might relieve him of
his agony.
For the sake of peace we agreed to
break a bottle of Pimple’s wine. The
cork had to be dragged out with a cork-
screw. The liquid was as flat as the
well water. A sip was enough for Pimple
and me, but Silent Joe appreciated it.
“A bit stale,” he said with his fingers.
“Too right! It wants gingerin’ up a
bit,” Pimple agreed. “Where is that
recipe-book?”
He found it behind a spirit-driven air-
fan, and fell to studying the page de-
voted to “Champagne.”
“Says ’ere that a little brandy may be
added to the liquid to hasten Termenta-
tion. H’m! There is no brandy. I’ve got
it! Where’s the methylated spirit?”
Frantically he and Silent Joe ran-
sacked the place, at long last to find the
spirit among the junk in the lean-to
back of the fowlhouse. They called me
to the kitchen, and we decanted the brew
into a large bread-mixing tin. ' Silent
Joe had forgotten all about his gripes.
When Pimple added to the brew a full
pannikin of metho. we tasted it. Silent
Joe with his fingers said that it was a
positive improvement. Pimple was
doubtful. One sip made me shudder.
To subdue the methylated spirit,
Pimple added half a bottle of vanilla
essence. It didn’t taste quite so raw
then. Silent Joe was willing to drink
the lot, and we had to be firm with him.
Pimple poured in a bottle of pain-killer,
and then a pannikin of yeast. On
impulse, he added three remaining pills
from a little box.
“If she don’t get a kick now, I’ll burn
that recipe-book,” he said.
The three sips and the smell gave
Silent Joe the ache. He rang up the
boss to ask for a week’s leave to go to
the Hill to have a tooth out. The boss
advised him to have them all out while
he was about it, and off went our com-
rade on a chance-passing truck.
While he was at Flanagan’s Hotel,
Pimple and I agreed to tell him on his
return that all the bottles had burst.
During the recovery. Silent Joe went
hunting around to find the broken bottles
to gain a little relief by smelling them.
As time passed we forgot all about
Pimple’s wine. He connected a wire with
the horse-trough ball-valve, and his in-
dicator showed 4 every time one of the
dogs went for a drink. His mind was
occupied with matters of a more lofty
nature than maturing champagne,
The autumn came—blessed relief after
the wind and dust of March and April
—and one morning the boss rang up to
say that Old Ben, with the bullock
waggon, should arrive that evening on
his way outback with a load of rations,
We first heard Old Ben coaxing his
bullocks up the far side ol the sand-
dunes beyond the rubbish-covered flat,
and we went to the front door to watch
the team crawl over the summit of the
surrounding sand barrier a quarter of a
mile distant.
“There they are!” Pimple announced
when the heads of the leading bullocks
showed above a declivity between two
sandhills. The others followed, pair by
pair, and there finally came into view
the top of the small load of rations,
We could now see Old Ben bobbing
about on his gammy leg, and hear his
unique expletives between the shotlike
cracks of his mighty whip, over which
old age was losing command,
When the team stopped right at the
pinch, Old Ben was beside the polers.
He ran along to the leaders, and, because
he was ancient, one-eyed and limpy, he
tripped over his long whip and scooped
the sand into his long, ill-kept whiskers.
“He always falls down when he gets
excited,” Pimple said. “I tipped that
them bullocks would get stuck in that
bit of sand.”
The windless evening permitted us to
hear every word of Old Ben’s impas-
sioned speech as he lay on his side on
the ground.
“Come down outer that, Frosty,” he
roared to the figure on top of the load,
“A-laughin’ up there like a young gel
wantin’ to be kissed.”
“Ah! Frosty Frank’s offsidin’ to Old
Ben,” Pimple observed. “Fat lot of good
sending ’im to offside to a bullock-
driver! Poor old Ben. Seventy, if he’s
a day, and still drivin’ bullocks. Mar-
vellous! I suppose we’d better go along
and lend a ’and.”
By the time we reached the team, Old
Ben’s efforts with the whip had turned
the bullocks into stubborn sulkers. When
the flats of shovels failed to achieve
movement, the driver cried with tears in
his usually bright eye:
“Let ’em stay there till they does pull
it out. Let 'em stay there all night, all
to-morrer, all next week, if they wants t\
Ten useless animiles, an’ a light waggon,
and four ounces of loadin’.”
By the time we got Old Ben to the tea-
billy he was done up. He sat at the
kitchen table, obviously depressed.by his
inability to get thirty hundredweight of
loading over a bit of a sandhill, when in
his youth, as he said, he had driven pink
tabletops over deep-dyed sand moun-
tains. I felt sorry for this defeat of
age. Softly, I suggested to Pimple that
a spot of his patent brew might do the
old fellow a little good.
“Care about a drop of wine, Ben?”
Pimple asked.
“Too right! Got any?” The years
fell away from the bullock-driver like
ancient garments. After the shock of
hearing that the brew actually existed had
worn off, Silent Joe fell to cat-licking his
moustache.
Pimple got out a bottle, wiped off the
sand, and untwisted the tie-wire while he
called for the corkscrew. The cork
flew out at the head of a long, seemingly
never-ending stream of foam. The foam-
streak swerved from the wireless set
on the bench to Old Ben’s white whiskers,
and there it paused. I waited pensively
for the roar of anger.
When the foam ceased there was not
a drop of liquor left in the bottle. Old
Ben had jumped to his feet. He opened
his mouth to volley his rage. Then he
shut it, and he passed his fingers down
his saturated whiskers. Then he sucked
them. Finally he beamed his apprecia-
tion.
“Got another bottle?” he asked, des-
perately hopeful.
Pimple managed to fill a pint pannikin
from two bottles. He handed it to Old
Ben. Silent Joe evinced intense excite-
ment. Pimple filled a pannikin for him.
He gave Frosty Frank half a pannikin.
My issue did not taste ill, but it was
unlike any wine I ever drank.
After ten minutes, Pimple had the wire-
less and the four gramophones all going
at once. Frosty Frank walked in and
out of all the doors just to hear the bells
ring and to watch the- indicator numbers
appear and disappear. Old Ben went
into raptures about his prowess with the
whip back in the ’sixties. He moved the
table to represent a team of fifty-eight
bullocks which he swore drew two table-
top waggons in tandem across the Blue
Mountains. He ran up and down the
table yelling: “Come ’ere, Pieface —come
’ere, Pinto,” and neve/ fell down once.
Someone began to sing “Roses Round
the Door.” At the time I took little notice
of the singer. Silent Joe was dancing
around on his poor feet, and through a
haze I came to see that it was he who was
singing about making mother love him
more. The telephone bell rang, and
kept ringing, but no one took any notice
of it.
It was getting dark when we thought
of the bogged bullocks.
“I’ll get ’em outer that if I ’ave to
flay the ’ides orf ’em.” roared Old Ben.
“They thinks I’m old and done for.
Why, I was never younger in me life."
“Gimme a shovel,” urged the no longer
Silent Joe.
Away we went in the gathering dark-
ness of falling night: Old Ben treading
on air; Silent Joe talking as fast as
any man could, fearful that should he
stop he never would talk again ; Frosty
Frank playing Red Indians; Pimple
strangely grave. He said that he remem-
bered slipping the three pills into the
brew, but he could not remember if they
were White’s Backache Pills or Wilson’s
Liver Pills, as both were the same color
and size.
Arriving on the sand-ridge in the pitch
dark, we worked like demons to make
the bullocks pull out the bogged waggon.
Old Ben, with wonderful agility, ran
up and down the team cracking his
enormous whip like a machine-gun,
whilst we belted at the bullocks with
shovels and pieces of timber. Our pro-
longed efforts, however, were of no
use. The bullocks were lying down.
They refused to get up, to move, even
to nod their heads.
Then Frosty Frank said that Old Ben
had flicked out his eye with the whip.
Pimple lay down and went to sleep.
Silent Joe went on talking. One by one
we dropped from sheer exhaustion.
Next morning, on sitting up, I was
amazed to see the waggon down on the
flat and the bullocks lying down under
their yokes and cheerfully chewing their
cud. Mystified, I stood up to look
around for the telltale tracks. I saw then
that the bullocks had pulled the waggon
off the sandhill whilst we had been sam-
pling Pimple’s wine, and that we had mis-
taken a row of sand-hummocks beside
the track for a team of bullocks.
Pimple couldn’t understand it. Frosty
Frank didn’t try to. Old Ben awoke
and asked for more wine. When Silent
Joe got up, he went on talking. He has
been talking ever since, even in his sleep.

“Psalmist of the Dawn,”
By MARY MARLOWE.
There are few settings left in the world
that some novelist or other has not used,
but for this charming romance Miss
Marlowe has found one of them. Her
story, from the bustle and feverishness
of city life, moves quickly to Lord Howe
Island, palm-crested speck in the Pacific
which is a romance in itself. Miss Mar-
lowe knows her islanders intimately:
remote from the world's hurly-burly;
characteristically ruled over by Three Wise
Men; altogether about the happiest people
on earth. The real and yet almost fairy-
tale island atmosphere gives the novel a
refreshing distinction, a compelling touch
of difference.
Psalmist of the Dawn,” by Mary Marlowe, is now on sale at
all bookstalls and newsagents. Published by The Endeavour
Press, 252 George Street, Sydney.
