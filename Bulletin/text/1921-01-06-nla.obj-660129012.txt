Disraeli’s Novels
Nearly a hundred years ago a young Jew,
Benjamin Disraeli by name, published
“Vivian Grey” and soared like a rocket into
the literary firmament. For over half a
century he blazed there with intermittent
splendor. Then began a descent almost as
remarkable as his rise, and to-day “Con-
ingsby,” “Sybil,” “Lothair” and the rest
stand on the shelves of the circulating
libraries with the dust of years undisturbed.
One wonders why. It is true that Dis-
raeli wrote prose of maddening artificiality
and incredible bombast. No man of genius
ever had worse taste. His passion for tinsel
and literary gauds overmasters- him, he dis-
gusts you with his fustian and attempts at
fine writing. But in the ultimate reckoning
of literary values every novelist’s claim to
recognition must depend upon the answer to
one question. Could he write? Disraeli
could. Side by side with his dreadful lapses
of style and taste you will find treasure
strewn about with prodigality. Epigrams
jostle threadbare tags, brilliant descriptive
stuff is there amongst the meaningless jargon,
each of the best books contains enough wit
to last a lesser and more economical man
a lifetime, and the portraits of men and
women of the day are done with the touch
of genius. And pervading everything there
is that subtle irony which gives Disraeli’s
work its stimulating tang. Is it any won-
der that he bewildered the stolid British pub-
lic?
It was in 1820 that Disraeli, an unknown
youth of 21, induced Colburn to publish
anonymously “Vivian Grey,” an “insolently
clever” society novel in the style of Flumer
Ward’s recent success “Tremaine.” Col-
burn, who had not much to learn in the art
of puffing, encouraged people to believe that
it was the work of Ward or any other celeb-
rity on whom their, curiosity chose to fasten.
“Vivian Grey” was favorably received by
the critics, and Society amused itself by
identifying the thinly-veiled characters. The
second volume w r as as dull as the first was
brilliant. Disraeli had obviously grown
tired of the whole thing. He conducted
Vivian Grey into exile, filled him with
Byronic despair, and in the end took refuge
in the crudest of melodrama. All this
might have been pardoned had the secret of
the authorship been kept. But it wasn’t,
and when the critics discovered that a book
about Society had been written by an out-
sider, and, worse still, by a Jew outsider,
their eyes were instantly opened to its dis-
tressing defects, and phrases like “boyish
impudence,” “shameful and shameless puff-
ery” and “ludicrous affectation of good
breeding” were thrown around.
In 1828 came “The Voyage of Captain
Popanilla,” a satire on Englishmen—especi-
ally the Utilitarians —and the English Con-
stitution. Ward, to whom it was dedicated,
declared that not since Swift and Voltaire
had there been anything so witty; to-
day it has all the succulence of
ashes. “The Young Duke,” another Society
novel, followed in 1880. “ ‘The Young
Duke’!” cried his father. “What does Ben
know of dukes?” But it was well received,
except by the Westminster Review,
which remarked, with tliq. urbanity of the
period, that “to parasites, sycophants, toad-
eaters, tuft-hunters and humble companions,
it would- be a book full of domfort and
instruction in their callings.”
“Contarini Fleming” (1832) and “Alroy”
(1833) were both inspired by a tour
in Asia. “Contarini Fleming,” described
as a “psychological romance,” is one
of the strangest things in the language,
a failure that came very near triumph,
Lockhart was perplexed between the
“affectations and absurdities” and the “life
and brilliancy” of the story. Milman said
that it was “very wild, very extravagant,
very German, very powerful, very poetical.”
Although Heine joined in the .chorus of
praise, asserting that modem English letters
had produced nothing equal to it, the book
was and has remained a failure. But it is
important as revealing Disraeli’s dreams of
winning fame in poetry, and there are strik-
ingly prophetic passages. “There is that
within me,” he says through the mouth of
one of his characters, “which may yet mould
the mind and fortune of my race.” Here
and there you find characteristic flashes like
“Though a great liar he was a dull man.”
and “Like all great travellers I have seen
more than I remember and remember more
than I have seen.” In “Contarini Fleming”
Disraeli’s style is at its best —rhetorically
splendid but seldom garish.
“Alroy,” a 12th-century tale of the Cali-
phate, portrays, Disraeli said, his “real am-
bition,” his vague dreams of carving out a
kingdom for his race. The style is extra-
ordinary. He tries rhythm and even rhyme,
and there are passages like
Pallid £hd mad he swift upsprang, and he tore
up a tree by its lusty roots, and down the declivity,
dashing with rapid leaps, panting and wild, he
struck the ravisher on the temple with the mighty
pine.
Maginn wrote a parody beginning:—-
Oh, reader dear, do look here, and you will spy
the curly hair and forehead fair, and "nose so high
and gleaming eye of Benjamin Disraeli, the won-
drous boy who wrote Alroy, in rhyme and prose, only
to show how long ago victorious Judah’s lion-banner
rose.
Then comes the period of Disraeli’s finest
work, “Coningsby,” “Sybil” and “Tancred.”
“Coningsby” is an attack upon the conserva-
tism of his party. “Sybil,” a vivid, even
melodramatic, contrast between the condition
of rich and poor, is perhaps the finest
account yet written of the industrial unrest
of the time.
For nearly 30 years the novelist was over-
shadowed by the statesman. But Opposition
left leisure for further literary work, and
“Lothair” came'out in 1870 and “Endymion,”
the last effort of the old man’s pen—he was
70- -in 1880. “Endymion,” though in every
way inferior to “Lothair,” brought a cheque
for £lO,OOO. His old enthusiasm for the
passing show of Mayfair is apparently tin-
dimmed, and once more we listen to drawing-
room wit and—lounge with exquisites on
lawns.
And what, we ask ourselves, is the mean-
's of this “serene meretrieiousness”? Did
Disraeli write all the time with his tongue '
in his cheek, or was lie really captivated, as
his letters to his sister seem to indicate, by
the glitter and the tinsel? Who can say?
For who has ever penetrated the mask of
this strange man. half charlatan, half genius,
who inherited from a long line of Spanish-
Jew ancestors the Orient’s reserve as well
as the Orient’s love of splendor?
G. C. DIXON.
The Gum-tree
Eucalyptus forest once covered the Brit-
ish Islands. That is proved by fossil
remains, but there is no word written
clearly in rock or legend to tell how it
passed away. Probably the glacial epoch
or several glacial epochs furnish the answer;
or tremendous bush-fires or monster white
ants. In any case the eucalyptus retired
altogether from tne battle in tue unfriendly
north and maintained itself oiny in Aus-
tralia ana a tew adjacent islands. Yet it
had its dreams of a grand .return to power;
for its vital force was unexhausted; It
could still cling to barren places where
other vegetation faildfi, still recover from
tbe attacks ox bush fires.’Still stand up to a
majesty of 400 feet when its roots were
in a soil it loved, still defy the competition
of other races of trees or live in kindly
brotherhood With them. The romance of the
eucalyptus which had come to an end in
the northern hemisphere at a period too
remote to be calculated began anew in the
south when Capt. Cook landed at Botany
Bay; for although the defeat suffered had
been a real one, the gum-tree found an ally
in man. Contingents of Australian trees
have made landings at many points on
European soil. Big groves of them stand
close to Rome; they have a footing in
France, in what was lately Turkey, in Greece
and some of the Tasmanian kinds rear their
heads in Britain. Australian soldiers loved
them in Palestine and on the desert roads
beyond; outposts of the race have found
their way to India, to South America, to
Texas, to South Africa. In some Maoriland
districts they are the characteristic vegeta-
tion ; and, taking the world as a whole, their
ranks are advancing more rapidly than those
of any other conqueror. The only growtn
at all comparable with tlioirs has been that
of the English language.
Yet it can hardly be claimed that the Aus-
tralian has been kind to the gum-tree. Mag-
nificent forests were once ruthlessly de-
stroyed. and the waste and ruin is not
greatly checked even to-day ; but some feel-
ing for the eucalyptus is growing, and this
is strongly reflected in the books that come
from the press. Two large new volumes
have just appeared: An Antliography of the
Eucalyptus, by Russell Grimwade (Angus
and Robertson), and A Research on the
Eucalyptus and Their Essential Oils, by
Richard T. Baker and Henry G. Smith
(Technical Museum, N.S.W.). The first of
these is a book of photographic illustrations
designed to aid the not too scientific person
in recognising the various species when he
sees them, with enough printed descrip-
tion with each plate to back up the photo-
grapher’s work. The few lines are often
fascinating. Thus, the habitat of the scarlet
flowering-gum is only 400 acres in the south
of Westralia, and much finer specimens are
to be found in cultivation than in the. tree’s
native wilds. Which means that this gor-
geous shrub was at its last ditch before it
made its alliance with man. It .would be
a very safe prediction that it will occupy
many thousands of acrek before many more
years of its story have been told. Then
there is the “Rose of the West” (E. macro-
car pa ), which has blooms five inches across
growing in threes and fours on the stem
—the finest flower of all its race. Most
readers, if they have gardens or shrubberies,
will want to know that little tree at first
hand. Russell Grimwade’s book is both
valuable and attractive, and its author has
been at infinite pains to get Jiis pictures
from life so that they show leaf, stem, flower
and fruit.
The work which comes from the Techni-
cal College is of greater scientific and only
Slightly less popular interest. There are
excellent illustrations in color, showing some
of the trees in flower, with characteristic
bark, sections of leaves magnified, with the
position of the oil glands indicated; and
many pictures not in color dealing with
phases of the oil-extracting industry. The
special qualities and products of each tree
are noted with most minute detail; and the
general reader will be amazed at the extent
and number of the chemicals to be obtained
from our forests. The present issue is a
second edition, enlarged and brought up to
date with the idea of enabling the work
to hold its place as the exhaustive and reli-
able guide to the subject. A great service
has been rendered to Australia by Messrs
Baker and Smith.
The ’Nineties
So much both bad and true is being said
of the eighteen-nineties (and has been said
since the corner was turned into the nine-
teen-hundreds) that it seems a fair thing to
say for once the good and equally true. In
passing, the literary journalist who cries
the, bad .so loudly in the London weeklies
owes bis existence to the period; the
’nineties taught him to create' and keep his
job. But. first, let me run over the bad to
get the focus for the good.
Oscar Wilde was a decadent wit mas-
querading as a man of letters. No line of
his verse or prose will last. I think, half
as long as some of his sayings: the self-
consciousness necessary to wit, and —more
importantly in Wilde’s case —the reputation
of wit. has colored all his work, and must
ultimately destroy it. Aubrey Beardsley
harnessed a supreme gift of black-and-white
to an imagination floundering in a morass
of queer brutality. Hubert Crackantliorpe

Just at present is probably the
most trying period of the year
owing to the extreme heat, often
accompanied by great humidity, with wet and cold
snaps sandwiched in between. It is this sort of
thing that makes people feel washed out, bad
tempered and devoid of energy. Any kind of work
is most irksome. The business man goes home
each day with a headache or some other bilious
symptoms, and probably finds his wife and family
in a similar condition. None® of them seem to
know exactly what they want or what is the matter.
In most cases it will be found that it is nothing
but the liver which has become disordered and upset
the system. Very simply caused but most distressing
%
while it lasts. At such a time Dr. Morse’s Indian
Root Pills are invaluable. They will correct this
trouble speedily and restore the organs to regular action. They act
directly, though gently, on the liver, and by this means tone the
system. Users of Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills are urged to
take them more freely while the trying weather lasts, as the
liver is most apt to get out of order at this time of the year.

Constipation is dangerous be-
cause it means that poisonous
materials which should have been
expelled from the body are being
retained. The appetite fails, diges-
tion becomes disordered and the
breath offensive. Pinkettes, the new
laxative, are a real help in correct-
ing constipation.
They do not aggravate the com-
plaint as strong purgatives do ; and
they do not wear out in Their effects.

VARIOUS VERSE
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The Readers.
A birchen book with hinges of gold
Held a man’s singing in days of old,
Where the letters marched in their black
. array
To tell the tale of a yesterday ;
And you were fair as the morning light
When one could spell but as he might.
Birchen boards with the words of the wise
Made happy sport for our four eyes;
And the strokes went up and the hooks
went down
Under your hair of shining brown.
For you were fair as the morning light
When two could read what one might write.
Deeper than rivers and wider than seas
Were those old leaves on your two knees.
Oh, sweetly grew the thing we knew
With one birch book between the two;
And morning swiftly kissed the night
When love read out what life could write.
A birchen book with hinges of gold
Held a great singing in days of old ;
But I had forgotten the way it went
Till a brown page made me ill content.
Then the dream came back with a far, sweet
light .
Of the leaves we turned ere the world could
write.

DAVID McKEE WRIGHT.
Under the Spell.
Around me are music and moonlight
And laughter of girl and boy,
And lovers that wander together
Forgetful of all save beauty,
And dreaming of naught but joy.
The moon, like a mistress of magic,
Has made of the shining deep
A wonderful waste of silver,
And under her misty mantle
The pines 'in their shadows sleep.
All life for a moonlit moment
Seems thrilling with old-time grace
And splendid with bygone glamor;
Because of a vague, strange sweetness
Forgotten are time and place.
Romance is astir and present,
It falls from the moon above
And enters and captures the spirit,
Till only the beautiful matters
And life is uplifted with love.
Now loud, and now low, o’er the waters,
Not knowing the charm, the delight
That distance bequeaths to his singing,
The voice of a rower, lone rowing,
Comes in through the hush of the night.
At moments like this, and like others
When earth as a flame, as a flower,
All lovely, entrances his vision,
Man’s soul enters into its kingdom,
And reigns for a radiant hour.
’Tis then that broad portals swing open
That he, for one moment, may see
Lost Eden, the beautiful birthplace
Of man, with its fountains and forests
And all that he was and would be.
Unwet with salt tears are the blossoms
• That bloom in that Garden of Light;
And there, a diaphanous phantom,
Walks one, with his form and his features
Unshadowed by death and by night.
As one in the book of Aladdin,
Spellbound and enchanted, I move
And feel that all else is unreal
Save this—save this wonder begotten
Of moonlight and music and love.
N.s.w.
RODERIC QUINN.
To an Infant.
You are a thousand little, souls in one,
Ah, child, so tender that I almost cry
To touch your lingers clutching at the sun
Like threads of dreams blown softly from
the sky.
Your tiny face is full of human woe
Behind its red rogue-laughter and pink
mirth.
Sometimes I cannot bear to hear you crow
For the old sobbings that break into birth.
That look just now, what did it mean, my
sweet ?
So pensive and so piteous that I turned
Half-looking for some shadow I might meet,
Someone for whom your infant being
yearned:
Some playmate, known somewhere, maybe,
and lost,
Some little, little creature like yourself,
Wistfully wondering why tides were crost
That bound and severed you. Ah, fragile
elf!
Frail, helpless soul with pleading hands and
eyes
Unutterably tragic in appeal,
How may I understand, how be made wise-
Just for one hour to the old fears you feel?
It is but yesterday I was as you,
One with Heaven sounds and God’s mute
loneliness.
I but a span ago the strange days through
Looked out imploringly on Life’s distress.
Now I forget, and yet. ah sweet, who knows?
I may be that child playmate you have
lost
So long, so long ago. Time swiftly flows
And drowns the footprints where our feet
have crost.

THE TOO-FORTUNATE ISLE.
“This week,” remarked, a Sydney paper with
pride, “the chosen of Australia’s 5,000,000
people meet representatives of 150,000,000
in cricket and tennis.” How account for
the phenomenon? The paper, finds it
almost childishly simple. Australians excel
because they “submit to discipline and
work.”
Excellence in any walk of life, whether it be
politics or law or song or tennis, is only won at
the cost of severe self-discipline and conscious striv-
ing. No champion of the bow or of the bat or of
the jaw ever won his championship by loafing.
But this is to say that the rival 150,000,000
have very much less energy and resolution
than ourselves. The explanation can be
put in a way less gratifying to the national
conceit. It shouts, at this time of year,
from thousands of beaches, cricket-fields,
tennis-courts and recreation-places of every
sort all over Australia. An endless stream of
great cricketers, tennis-players, boxers and the
like is produced here, not because these people
are more resolute and ascetic than Eng-
lishmen or Americans, but because conditions
are infinitely more favorable to their de-
velopment. Australia, not excepting most
of the tropical North, is a vast physical-
culture academy. The results appeared
in the members of the A.1.F., who were
said to weigh on the average nearly a stone
more per man than the Imperial troops;
and they may be seen to-day wherever num-
bers of native-born citizens are gathered
together. This country., with its abundant
food, its agreeable climate, the high physi-
cal quality of its pioneers, and its measures
against alien immigration, has been spawn-
hig athletic raw-material for the past cen-
tury, and is still doing it.
* * * *
But the production of great cricketers or
tennis-players has, unfortunately, little or no
relation to mental or moral qualities.
Thumper's wonderlul strokes did not come
from tireless practice. If. they could be
achieved by such means the world would
have plenty of Tkumpers. Brookeses, Pat-
tersons, Spoeeorths, Darcys, Beaure-
paikes —these and a hundred others were not
nearly so much made as born. America’s
greatest tennis-players come from Cali-
tornia, which is the State whose climate
most nearly approximates to that of the
more closely-settled parts of Australia ; and
Hawaii and Samoa, with a mere handful of
native population, have produced greater
swimmers than Europe and Asia, witu their
hundreds of millions. It is possible, of
course, for a man to simultaneously de-
velop his body and his mind; but
nine times out of ten he who lets him-
self become pre-occupied with sport tends
to deteriorate on the mental side. Com-
pare the environment-created- habits of a
modern Australian and Englishman. The
poorest Australian has every inducement to
put in his holidays and much of Ins spare
time out of doors and in the healthiest sur-
roundings. Thousands spend most of their
lives under such conditions. The British
wage-earner who works in a city may see
the ocean for a fortnight or so once a year.
The rest of his life is largely spent in semi-
darkness, or even underground. The lot of
the fast-vanishing agricultural class is only
relatively better. The effect is to be seen
in the physique of these unfortunates who,
as the Diggers noted over and over again,
look like members of a different race when
compared with their, fellow-countrymen who
have enjoyed from birth the means to live
differently. Yet what other people in the
world’s history have in 50 years produced
so glittering an army of poets, historians,
novelists, essayists, philosophers, scientists,
playwrights? They have not been conlined
to any one class; some of the greatest of
them— Carlyle, Dickens, Wells, Hardy
—began under what seemed to be unfavor-
able conditions. They were poor, could
afford no recreations, and had to educate
themselves. There have been nations cap-
able of running that ample allowance of
leisure which is demanded by superlative
physical excellence side by side with the
loftiest intellectualism. Athens before the
Peloponnesian War is a case in point. The
little Periclean army of freemen to which
the A.I.F. was often compared by the Brit-
ish and French typified physically the whole
race; and in literature, scientific research
and the arts of government, Athens led the
world. Australia leads most white coun-
tries in physical matters. How does it
stand as regards mental prowess?
The general level of a self-governing
people’s culture may be gauged by the Parlia-
ments which it elects. And our multi-
tudinous legislatures, while well-meaning, on
the whole, exhibit a colossal ignorance of
the thought-movements which are taking
place' in the world outside. Futile rows are
interspersed through the debates. These
unedifying incidents do not arise from
natural bad feeling or ill-temper, or from
anything but the exasperation of inarticulate
men who, failing the capacity to express
themselves in coherent language, shout
epithets like “Liar !” or “Skunk !’’ or even, as
wealthy N. S. Wales Tories did during the
uproar over the Willis Speakership matter,
throw missiles. Under the same impulse
illiterate persons who are not politicians,
unable to give any other vent to the emotions
boiling within them, fight .in streets and bars.
A fact which this country has to face is that,
intellectually speaking, the odds are against
it. The very conditions which give us 20 or
30 times our due proportion of Macartneys,
Armstrongs, Gregorys and so on threaten
to deprive us of thinkers. There are really
few Bolsheviks or revolutionaries in Aus-
tralia ; yet so clamantly did the chief of our
handicaps to progress call last year that
5.052,726 working days were sacrificed, and
£3,492,936 in wages was lost. The Aus-
tralians are a great race, with all sorts of
potentialities, but they will never rise much
above the, status of cricket-ground and foot-
ball-field heroes, the idols of the world’s small
boys, till they do. more thinking. And then
they will close their ears to the siren voices
which are ever calling them away from the
only jobs that are worth a grown man s
while. ._
LABOR IN SEARCH OF A
CONTRACTOR.
That luckless collection of Tony Lumpkins
which confuses public affairs at Sydney has
produced two fairly new ideas lately. One
was embodied in its bill prohibiting the
pulling down of Sydney or Newcastle slum
dwellings for purposes of improvement save
under impossible conditions. The other was
that the city railway and the North Shore
bridge should be constructed very suddenly,
the contractor being paid in bonds. Both
imply that all idea of decentralisation has
been abandoned, if an idea can be abandoned
when it was never entertained except as elec-
tion claptrap. The policy under which the
metropolitan district has eight persons to
the acre (one municipality has 88), which
number is fast increasing, while all the State
outside the two big towns has one inhabitant
to 175 acres, which number is fast diminish-
ing, is accepted as permanent, and all possible
provision is to be made to keep it so and
push the movement ahead. All the doings
of the unhappy State’s Ministries result m
concentration, and during the big loan. period
marvels have been done in that way m rais-
ing money to open up the country and using
it to shut the country. These are some
recent figures: —
Decrease
■* in Number Increase of
Loans of People Estimated
Spent on in Rural Sydney
“Development.” Pursuits. Population.
1915.. £6,996,107 7143 6,930
1916.. 8,173,104 2888 1,600
1917.. 6,862,179 1205 12,700
1918.. 4,487,511 1716 1-5.400
1919.. 3,918,887 952 36,000
The comparative failure to destroy the agri-
cultural population in 1919 is possibly due
to the unusually small amount of loan ex-
penditure, and, besides, a vast amount of
Federal borrowings were in that year applied
to create temporary artificial settlement.
These remarkable results have been
achieved without any great or unusual ex-
penditure on works actually in Sydney, but
if a huge amount of railway and bridge
money is laid out there something much
bigger is looked for. Of course practically
all public works expenditure is' really in
Sydney, just as over the border it is really
in Melbourne or Adelaide. Where a patch
of wealth is seen or suspected a railway is
sent out to bring it to the capital, just as
a pasha is sent out in Turkey or a mandarin
in China. The railway as practised in Aus-
tralia, the pasha and the mandarin are all
the same kind of developers. The last
published official mao showed that there are
36 far ends to Ma State railways, but there
is only one near end, and that is the end at
the one big city. Wealth like water has a
tendency to get into holes, especially it
channels are made to lead it to the hole.
Then population gathers round the hole like
animals coring to drink. In N. S. Wales
and Victoria and S. Aus. there is only one
hole. England alone, leaving out Scotland
and Ireland, has 11 important and a multi-
tude of less important holes and near-ends
to its railways; judged by their commerce
their order is: Liverpool, London, Cardiff,
the Tyne, Falmouth. Swansea, Hull. New-
port, Manchester, Middlesborough and Bris-
tol. So great is the passion in N. S. Wales
for one hole only that, though all sorts of
cross-country lines have been built connect-
ing the Sydney and North-Western, Sydney-
Western and Sydney-South-Western lines, no-
thing on earth can get a finished cross
country connection with the Northern line
which might make Brisbane accessible and
also increase the demand for a live N. S.
Wales port and city on the North Coast.
Ministers go up that way and sympathise
and promise; but nothing happens or will
happen till after Separation.
As already mentioned, the 13 Ministers
propose to spend a large sum absolutely
in Sydney, and not merely with one end
of the expenditure in Sydney. This is the
necessary alternative to the other policy of
giving a lot of people (waterside folk and
others) the chance to leave Woolloomooloo
and settle under new hygienic conditions
(not conditions that date back to Governor
Phillip’s insanitary time) at Goff’s Harbor
or Twofold Bay. If a contractor or a set
of contractors can be found to build a
bridge and railway in return for bonds, they
must be at least 8 per cent, bonds. They
would have to be put on the market, for no
contractors could afford to be out of 50
millions or even 10 millions for a long
series of years, and no debentures carrying
less than 8 per cent, would have a chance
to fetch their value when a market, already
staggering under Government securities, was
struck in the solar plexus by a fresh ava-
lanche. What return the railway is expected
to yield is not stated. Just before the war
six London city railways paid respectively
£5, £3, £1 12s. 6d., £1 10s., £1 and nil per
cent. The one-pounder had previously had
seven blank years. These lines were built
by cheap labor and worked by men whose
average wage w T as 275. 4-Jd. per week. At
N. S. Wales rates they would probably have
paid no interest on cost and less than half
working expenses. Underground railway
fares have to be about double surface tram
fares, because there is so much capital to
pay interest on, and it is mighty hard to
make ends meet. There is vague talk of
Sydney’s bridge and subterranean (or
mostly-so) railway costing £10,000,000. But
one—just one —of London's seven city cheap-
labor railways swallowed over £19,000,000,
another £16,000.000 (that was the 1 per
cent, fellow), and another £13,000,000. Syd-
ney doesn’t want so much city line as Lon-
don, but even a little bit of line is costly.
* * * *
In any case it seems lunacy to talk of
a (one) city railway as something that will
meet the case. In the year which ended
on June 30, 1920, all the railways in the
Ma State carried 114,654,660 passengers.
The Sydney and suburban tramways car-
ried over 301,000,000, and the reason why
the system is now at its last gasp and the
road is strewed with dead and injured
people is that this was 54,000,000 more than
the number carried the year before. There
will probably be a similar increase the next
year. It is really a question, unless the
policy of bloating the One Big City goes
overboard, of making city lines that will
get to work within the next two years, and
carry, say, 108,000,000 passengers to begin
with, that being two years’ increase, and
the traffic will afterwards grow indefinitely.
In other words, they need to carry at the very
outset almost as many as all the railways do
now. London’s wonderful network of city
railways hasn’t alleviated the traffic problem
in the least: the system has only prevented
it growing worse quite so fast as it would
otherwise have done. It will be the same
in Sydney if the bloating policy is continued.
But there is this moral difference: Sydney’s
bloat is a premeditated iniquity, the vast
State being deliberately drained to bring
it about, while London bloats because in a
crowded land there is no place to put a
new London. #
However, all other aspects of the case
fade into insignificance compared with that
of this alleged Labor Ministry of house-
agents, fresh young lawyers, land specula-
tors and trades-union organisers out look-
ins for one of the hated race of contractors
who will accept £15,000,000 or £50,000,000
worth of 8 or 9 per cent. Government secu-
rities. and get his coat off. If some such
person isn't found there will be a constant
increase of messy happenings on the Sydney
tramlines. Also, there will be more trouble
with the growing army of unemployed—the
men who mostly have no trades, and if they
had wouldn’t be allowed to work at them
by the new school of Bolshevik union bosses
whom Labor leaders cultivated and encour-
aged in their irresponsible days. And if
the financial phenomenon—the new and
vastly enlarged Norton Griffiths— is
found, there are likely to be happenings in
the country. North and South are already
looted to the limit to support railways
which exist for the express purpose of kill-
ing northern and southern ports. If they
are, in addition, to be taxed to support
great and enormously costly city works built
by go-slow labor and with the dearest money
that Australia ever borrowed, the secession
movement may be so unanimous that the
Countv of Cumberland will be left to form
a State by itself. Then, with the uprising of
new towns, the pressure on Sydney might be
relieved, and it might struggle along 'with-
out its railway till it got some money and
a Government that was compos mentis.
POLITICS AND THE PACIFIC.
Crying oyer spilt milk is a waste of time and
tears unless it leads you to avoid capsizing
the jug again. But for the fact that the
Commonwealth Government is risking an
upset of Australian interests in the South
Pacific by its delay and indecision in regard
to the ex-German territories, the mistakes
made and the chances missed in the Pacific
in the past would have no more than a
purely historic interest. As it is, the way
in which past opportunities of making most
of the Pacific a British, and, incidentally, an
Australasian, lake were' let slip ought to be
a warning and a beacon-light for the present
and the near future. .
Australia is still standing on one foot to-
day, six years after the occupation of ex-'
German New Guinea and two years after
the end of the war, waiting for the formal
issue of a mandate by the League of Nations.
Meantime Japan in the Carolines and the
Marshalls, and Maoriland in Samoa, have
gone right ahead on the theory that posses-
sion is nine points of the law and a bit
over. Now there is some prospect of the
mandates being dealt with by a league of
which Austria and quite possibly Ger-
many herself will be members.« And what
have we done to justify our stewardship to
indifferent, not to say hostile, judges?
Naturally our champion spell-binder has
uttered some bold words on the subject; but
where is the solid backing? On September
10, 1919, the Prime Minister asked the House
of Reps, to approve the Treaty of Versailles
and said, after referring to the promulgation
of the Monroe doctrine: —
Therefore it is proper that a like doctrine should
be promulgated on behalf of Australia. I say—
and this surely is a matter far outside of Parlia-
mentary politics—that so far as the Pacific is con-
cerned; at least within the area and sphere of our
influence, it, too, is covered by a doctrine that it
is for us to settle, and for nobody else. It is as
well to make that point clear at the outset. While
the Monroe doctrine exempts the two Americas
from the jurisdiction of the League of Nations, we
will not allow anything relating to our sphere in
the Pacific to be regarded as a proper subject for
submission to that tribunal.
Thut sounds as if it meant something definite
and drastic; but apparently it is like
dreams, to be interpreted by the rule of
contrary. Since then the Commonwealth
has dawdled and dilly-dallied for over a year.
It has done something, it is true—cut down
the Australian Navy till it looks like a heap
of ha’pence. If politicians read history, past
happenings in the Pacific would teach them
that prompt action, combined with fore-
sight, not hazy, talk and reliance on a chapter
of accidents and other people’s good inten-
tions, is what counts.
Britain made a good start in 1786 by
including within N. S. Wales all the “ad-
jacent islands” in the Pacific Ocean. This
Governors King and Macquarie, not to
mention others, interpreted as including
Maoriland and Tahiti. In 1806 plans were
laid for General Crawford to lead an ex-
pedition fo Chile, then ripe for revolt against
Spain, and the success, of this would have
given the British race both sides of the
South Pacific. But it did not come off, and
the half-hearted attempts elsewhere in South
America were bungled. Thus was lost a
fine opportunity of making the whole
Southern Hemisphere British. It has never
come again. In 1813 the U.S. frigate Essex
gave a taste of what an enemy base in the
Pacific Islands might mean by making her
headquarters in the Marquesas group and
capturing 17 British whalers. The lesson
was not heeded, and in the ’twenties and
’thirties Britain eight times disclaimed
ownership even of Maoriland, ■ though she
was pushed into taking it over in 1840. In
1848 George Grey, who had gone on to
rescue Maoriland after pulling S. Australia
out of the mud, asked the Colonial Office to
let him comply with the requests of local
chiefs and annex Tonga and Fiji. He re-
marked that it was not likely that other
European Powers would leave the Pacific
Islands alone if we did, and urged that an
extension of our possessions in those seas
would be a source not of weakness but of
strength. The Colonial Office remained dull
as lead. Five years later, when France
occupied New Caledonia, Grey was able to
say “I told you so.” In view of all the
later bother about New Guinea it is worth
noting, too, that in 1867 the N. S. Wales
Government urged that the increasing traffic
through Torres Strait made the possession of
New Guinea “a matter of the highest im-
portance to Australian colonists.” Lives
and cash might have been saved and any
amount of complications and worry avoided
if action had been taken then or during the
next dozen years. In 1874 Julius Vogel,
then Premier of Maoriland, pointed out, with
a prophetic touch, that Germany, as well as
other Powers, was taking an interest in the
islands of the Pacific. He urged that if
Maoriland were given her head she might
“earn for reluctant Great Britain —without
committing her to responsibilities she fears
—a grand island dominion.” Vogel had an
idea of a M.L. company which should do in
the Pacific Islands what the East India Cos.
had done in India ; but when the Government
10 years later introduced a bill to create such
a company it failed to pass. The Maoriland
Parliament had passed in 1883 a bill by
which M.L. could take over any Pacific
Islands which sought union, but Britain dis-
allowed even this. Before that N. S. Wales
had got busy in 1875 with a large-sized pro-
posal that Britain should annex not onlv
New Guinea, but New Britain, New 7 Ireland,
the Solomons, the New 7 Hebrides, the Mar-
shall, Gilbert and Ellice groups. Britain
did nothing: she merely observed that there
Avas no indication bf any intention on the
part of a foreign State to annex islands in
the Pacific. It was not true for long. How
Germany w 7 as let into New Guinea and
Samoa and how the weird wine-and-water
arrangements in the New Hebrides came to


be, are well-known instances. It has been
all a policy or drift.
All the instances, by the way, are not
south of the line. That the British took
Manila in 1762 and gave it up next year
is ancient history; and Java, Sumatra,
Borneo and the rest of the Netherlands
Indies were given up at the end of the
Napoleonic wars. As late as 1875 Britain
let Japan, then just coming out of her shell,
take over'the Bonin Islands, which had been
settled by British subjects for over 40 years.
She thus gave up a handy little group, with
a fine fortifiable harbor, lying right athwart
the route from Japan to the Carolines and
Marshalls and, incidentally, to Australia. It
would have been easy to keep the Bonins then
and they might have been useful now.
It is too late to worry over all the wonder-
ful chances that have been let slip in the
Pacific; but Australia cannot afford to let
any more get by her. As Hughes has said,
this isn’t politics; and because it isn’t, talk
and tricks won’t fill the bill.
DONALBAIN.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
On the Feasibility of Painting the Sky
a New Shade of Blue.
The next A.L.P. Conference will open fire
at Sydney with 274 propositions to consider.
Those that deal with economic matters are
mostly based on the same old misunder-
standing to which this country clings while
others begin to abandon it—that war has
made the world richer instead of poorer, and
that consequently there is a door some-
where which leads to the paradise of
much more pay for much less work,
only capitalists or some other people have
painted it to look so exactly like the adjacent
wall that nobody has yet found it, and they
have taken away the handle and the key-
hole to complete the deception. One notable
proposition is to the effect that, in return
for four hours’ service per day, rendered to
the State, every worker should have all the
necessaries of life delivered at his door.
That suggests a job for Cod rather than
for man. The usual hatred of compulsory
military service, even for the defence of
this country and of the people’s liberties,
is manifested in the proposal that certain
Laborites, expelled on a life sentence for
wanting to protect' Australia against the
Ilun, should be readmitted provided they have
belonged to no other political party during
the time they were victimised, and provided
they swear solemnly never to believe in
“conscription” again even when the nation is
in its death agony. Probably not one in
a hundred of the men who hate compulsory
service with a deadly hatred because they
have been told by their bosses to do so know
the reason why. The reason is simply that*
the bosses desire that the conscript or com-
pulsory industrial forces of the One Big
Union shall be the only big organised
body in Australia when the time comes
to sweep away popular self-government
and the principle of one-adult-one-vote,
and elevate a little oligarchy of Direct
Actionists to power; also they desire
that no military oath of allegiance
shall weigh on any man’s mind and divide
his allegiance when he receives orders to
wreck the edifice of his own liberty. Then there
will come before the Conference the usual
schemes for social improvement, vaguely
worded, scarce of detail and regardless of
expense. But no one has a definite plan
for getting half the population out of the
present three or four monstrous cities and
resuming the pioneer business that was
abandoned a half-century ago. And no one
suggests that the thin loan crust on which
our local civilisation stands is cracking and
showing an abyss beneath. And especially
no one takes notice of the fact that the war-
boom edifice has now got a lean in it like
the tower of Pisa and is sagging right above
the Conference’s head. Yet things are hap-
pening, especially in the mining world, that
are calculated to shake up even a sanguine
person who expects all the necessaries of
life left at his door every four hours. Cer-
tain silly geniuses contrived that Broken
Hill should be on long strike when lead
was £52 per ton and spelter £59 17s. 6d.
and silver 7s. per ounce, and having no
organising ability they didn’t even attempt
to run co-operative mines with the labor
that was going to waste, and profit by the
boom. Then, when lead was at £22 ss. and
spelter at £25 15s. per ton and silver had
dropped to 3s. 5d., there was a sudden tend-
ency to .resume and race after the lost ’bus,
which was nearly two years ahead as the
crow flies. But though the managements
might keep the mines going if they were
going, and if reserves had been piled up in
the boom time, some of them lack the heart
or the money to start again in the midst of
a slump. Besides, the suspension of the local
paper, stopped because the union bosses
weren’t allowed to censor the contents, shows
that the strike tyranny is as virulent as ever,
and the prospect of making a start only to
meet with another hold-up isn’t alluring.
Many of the mines, in fact, can only live
with reduced wages and cheaper materials
(coal, etc.), which also means reduced wages,
This applies not only to Broken Hill but
elsewhere. Copper and tin have tumbled
like silver and lead, so nearly every mine
at Cloncurry has closed, Mount Morgan
and Wallaroo and Moonta are on the verge
of closing, and Cobar has gone over the
edge. In fact, prices, over which Australia
has no control, since the buyers are abroad,
are sagging back towards the pre-war level,
and unless other things take the back-track
also, automatic stoppage must ensue. All
the paper money that could be printed
wouldn’t sufficiently subsidise the mines to
keep them open, for the paper would so
lose its value that it would require to be
subsidised itself and would fail to keep
itself open. And, with all this impending,
Labor’s big Parliament is to potter along with
the old chimeras about the reconstruction of
the universe and the painting of the sky a
new shade of blue. It _shows how impover-
ished in imagination the Labor party has
become.
The End of a System.
Until Ryan got going in Queensland, West-
raiia had stumbled further along the road
to Government ownership than any other
State. In an enthusiastic attempt to
'nationalise” everything the Scaddan Gov-
ernment piayed up £14,000,000 of loan money
(about £45 per head of population) in about
four years and achieved a deficit on current
account of £1,500,000 —this, the chief archi-
tect of ruin explained, was “all in the
pockets of the people.” Loan railways
shaped like a dog's bind leg spread them-
selves over the landscape. State sawmills,
steamers, butcheries, fish-shops, pubs, freez-
ing works and implement factories arose in
profusion. The theory was that if State
enterprises were multiplied indefinitely
Westralia would become a flowing with
work and money; also, that if the Govern-
ment became the universal employer every-
body would be so happy that there would be
no more strikes. The was con-
sidering vast schemes for starting State gold-
mines, supplying free school-books and
shanghais to State scholars, and establish-
ing State factories for the extraction of
moonshine from water-melons when the
thunder of the guns in Europe shattered all
its bubbly dreams. It fell, and transmitted
to its successors an enormous debt, an inex-
tinguishable deficit, a score or two of unpay-
able undertakings and a> public service
bloated beyond all reason and —in part, at
least—made arrogant and intractable by
political patronage. • A few tons of rotten
traditions were also among the inheritance,
for the evil a Government does lives after
it, and when it sets out to demonstrate that
shipowners, implement-makers, sawmillers
and other taxpayers can be done without,
subsequent Administrations are apt to get
it in the neck. Partly by inclination and
partly by necessity, the Governments that
succeeded Scaddan have been carrying on
as he began. And in place of the financial
blessings he predicted there is a public debt of
40 millions (the population is about 340,000)
and the deficit ( his deficit) approaches five
millions. For the last nine years the State
has been spending half a million per annum
more than it earned on current account.
And the thousands of Government employees
that Were to have been so affluent and con-
tented are about the most violently dissatis-
fied body of toilers in Australia. One sec-
tion of them went on strike a few months
ago and closed all the State schools and
public departments. Another division, the
locomotive engine-drivers, firemen and
cleaners, came out on New Year’s Day, and
the Government railways are now idle. Last
year the hapless Administration that, in
theory, ought to be rolling affluence,
announced a debit balance of £664,000, of
which the railways were responsible for
£400,000. This year it has had to find an-
other £720.000 for increased wages and
salaries (the railwaymen’s share is
£310,000), and it is imposing a 15 per cent,
super tax on land and incomes. It has
also piled new imposts on the users of the
railways, but although this device added
£267,000 to the revenue it cost another
£297.000 to drag it in. And now the
drivers have struck for 255. per seven-hour
day, with 50 per cent, more for overtime and
night work, and double pay on Sundays; and
the firemen for £1 a day and boy-cleaners
for 14s. 6d. a day, with time and a half and
double rates as aforesaid, and the customary
benefits and privileges which Government
railway employees everywhere receive. They
have done more than sprag the wheels of
industry; they have utterly smashed the
fool-system of “nationalising” everybody and
everything with other people’s money.
The Demoralisation of Queensland.
The Theodore Government rolls steadily
along on the road to ruin, and there is
apparently no one able to stop the Mad-
man’s Chariot. The attempt to get in the
two-million “loan” by way of compulsion
has been abandoned, certain institutions hav-
ing promised, it is understood, to under-
write the lot on condition that certain legis-
lative proposals are dropped for the moment.
Yet the state of Queensland’s indebtedness
is such that the assisting of the Govern-
ment to further increase that liability is
indefensible, on the face of it- With the
floating of the £2,000,000 “loan” things in
Queensland will stand thus: —
State debt of Queensland .. .. £72,000,000
Proportion of Commonwealth debt on
population basis .. .. .. 55,000,000
Liability of local bodies .. .. 4,000,000
Total public debt .. ..£131,000,000
Estimating the population, roughly, at
700,000, we thus find the State is saddled
with a liability, of £lB7 per head for every
man, woman and child! Surely it is the
height of unwisdom on the part of Solvent
financial institutions to assist a State
to add to such a burden as that,
especially as two millions to this Gov-
ernment is the merest flea-bite, and within
three months it will undoubtedly be on
the mat clamoring for more. Yet in spite
of its gigantic spendings the Government
utterly fails to bring prosperity to the
working people whom it coddles and cuddles
and debauches. The report of the State’s
Public Relief Department demonstrates this
in striking fashion. Here are the official
figures:—
Expenditure on Relief.
1914-1915 (Denham regime) .. .. £5,869
1917- (Ryan-Theodore) .. .. 9,152
1918- (Theodore) .. .. .. 26,412
1919- (Theodore) . . .. .. 78,859
So that where Liberalism six years ago
found it necessary to spend only £6OOO in
relieving distress, this bogus brand of Labor
finds it imperative to spend nearly £BO,OOO
—by way of demonstrating, of course, how
tenderly careful it is of the welfare of the
working classes. Apparently the further
Queensland gets on the way to the commu-
nistic Paradise the more desperately hard-up
do her people become. And the relief expen-
diture is not only increasing but seems
to be going ahead in a geometrical ratio.
In 1918-19 Theodore distributed nearly
three times the amount of doles that he did
in the previous year, and in 1919-20 three
times the amount spent in 1918-19. When
relief outpourings increase nearly ninefold
in two years, it is time the easy-going body
known as the General Public began to take
notice. A town like Bundaberg consumes
in relief as much as did the whole State in
Denham’s time. Townsville accepted doles
to the tune of nearly £4OOO in 1918-19
and then rushed the same class of expendi-
ture up to £12,456 in 1919-1920. There
could be only one reasonable excuse for such
a thing in the most fertile and best-watered
province of Australia, and that would be
the existence of a continuous drought with
its consequent calamities. But the sea-
sons have been, on the whole, remarkably
good, and the revenue magnificent, being
easily the largest on record. What, then,
is the key to this mysterious bolt into
pauperism? The truth is that certain poli-
ticians in the Northern State are busy
breaking down the morale of the people.
Men are encouraged to apply for State
benevolence on every possible occasion, and
are told there is no shame in the acceptance
thereof. With little difficulty an able-bodied
single man or woman can secure from 10s.
to 12s. 6d. worth of free rations on appli-
cation and assertion of destitution, and there
are scores of instances in Brisbane where
free State food ranging in value from £1
to 30s. is dumped weekly on the tables of
certain families. Only a short time ago
the Auditor-General significantly mentioned
that “in the month of June last the State
butcheries in the metropolitan area issued
beef to the value of £135 per week, and that for
the three months, June, July, August (1919)
the relief expenditure was £12,829 as
against £2lll for the corresponding three
months of 1918.” Evidently the State
butchery, the State fish-shop, the State em-
norium are going to play a big part in the
future of Bananaland. Half-a-dozen free
tickets will be required by Soi.omon Go-
Slow in the happy days to come, and on
presentation thereof at the portal of the
State shops all his cares and anxieties will
vanish into thin air.
A Slum in Some Great Wilderness.
The first Fair Kents Act in N. S. Wales was
passed by a Labor Government in 1915 under
the stress of war. It was followed by a
severe house famine, though this was partly
due to the fact that so many builders were
fighting abroad. Now that they are back and
the house famine is worse, a new measure is
propounded under the stress of peace. For-
merly the building of houses (flats excepted)
to rent practically ceased because of (1)
the increase (officially reckoned as 36 per
cent, between 1914 and 1918) in cost; (2)
the reduction of rents by the Court; ( o )
the stupendous increase of taxation; (4) the
fact that the market was skinned of money
by the boundless loan policy of State
and Federal Governments, principally the
former; (5) the fact that public securities
could be bought to yield even 8 per cent.,
with tax exemptions added, which is better
and easier than fighting battles with the
Fair Kents Court, the tax man, and hostile
tenants, to say nothing of the point that
the man who dabbles in public securities
is called a patriot, while one who supplies
people with houses is called the nasty things
that Doyle called Henley. Finally, so far
as Sydney is concerned, land to build on is
dear beyond all records, and there are fears
of a slump; also the supply of five-day-per-
week artisans is rather small. The new
bill doesn’t provide for more houses or
better houses, or more labor or land or
money or any new towns to take the human
overflow from Woolloomooloo. But it puts
its foot down with the usual thud and pro-
vides -
(1) That the restrictions shall be'extended to
houses let at .£4 or shops let at £8 a week, so
that the trouble, whatever it is, may spread further.
(2) That any lessee who has paid or offered his
rent, or who has done neither, hut has a fair
excuse to put forward, may apply to the Court to
reduce his rent.
(3) That the Court may grant new leases up to
six months at its own rent and on its own condi-
tions, so that the landlord who wants to resume
possession of his property may begin to wonder if
he owns the property.
(4) That a landlord who refuses to let a house to
“a respectable and responsible person” with children
may be fined £SO unless he proves that it wasn’t on
account of the children that he refused. V et if
the rooms are four and the children are 10 there
may be some shadow of excuse.
(5) That any person who refuses to let an un-
occupied dwelling “to any applicant” (respectable,
responsible, nigger, Chinese or otherwise) may be
fined £SO unless he can satisfy the Court. And
nothing is said in this clause about the rent that
“any applicant” may offer.
(6) That any person who alters a residence to
use it for some purpose other than a residence —
say a factory or shop—without permission of the
Court may be fined £SO.
(7) That £SO fine ( shall lie in wait for anybody
who, without consent of the Court, shall pull down
any dwelling-house, hovel or shack, however old,
dirty, unprofitable or unsightly, within the 149
square miles of Sydney, or within the boundaries
of Newcastle or seven miles beyond. It is assumed
that the house famine has come to stay for ever,
which it probably has, if the present regime lasts,
and that all hope is lost and that improvement
must stop. And the Court is not to give consent
unless the landlord proves that he is putting up
(somewhere within reach, of course, which will be
'difficult at Woolloomooloo) residences to hold as
many people or more. “Duly constituted authority”
may order demolition in extreme cases, but it hardly
dares to do that when it means putting people into
the street.
All this may make things a shade better
for the person who is in the house, but only
by making them the same amount worse for
the person who wants to get in. It looks
like putting the immortal kybosh on any
ambition to build houses for letting pur-
poses, especially as it extends the draw-
backs which helped to stop the building of
155.-per-week premises to’ the building of
SOs. ones also, especially as 6 per cent.
Government securities are becoming cheaper
than ever, and the banks have no longer
many spare coppers to finance builders with.
It might be thought that a constructive
Ministry could do something better than
order that the old slum dens must stay
indefinitely. In the first place there are
said to be 15,000 to 20,000 unemployed now
in and around the Ma metropolis, and
despite all the efforts made for years past
to prevent boys learning trades some of
them surely know something. And with
309,253 square miles inhabited by 34 humans
per mile there is surely some place to put.
somebody apart from Woolloomooloo. Ue

everything varies from ioO hne up to hve
years’ gaol. .
The Comic Opera at Fiume.
The Italians, who invented modern banking.
(Egibe’s bank at Babylon wasn't modern),
insolvency, pawnbroking and the Roman
Empire, are a clever folk and let few chances
pass them. Consequently some people fancy
that the long-drawn-out opera at iiume, on
which the curtain was rung down the other
day, wasn’t the spontaneous affair it looked,
but a brilliantly stage-managed business all
through. When the Austrian Empire dod-
dered to the grave Italy absorbed Trieste
and Pola, and it thought it could do also
with Fiume, the Croatian port which was
the sea gateway to reconstructed Serbia,
and possibly also with' the Dalmatian coastal
strip—in fact, it could do with so much
that Serbia was in danger of becoming an
inland country again. (As the heir of the
old Roman Empire, Italy has claims even on
London and Bagdad, though not on New
York and Chicago.) There was no formal
seizure and no official lighting up of the
flames of war. Only Italy’s maddest and
most picturesque poet went madder than
usual, and seized Naboth’s Vineyard with
the aid of a free company raised and financed
by means not very clear. Italy hadn’t
sent him, and wasn’t responsible for him,
and cast him off as if he was a venomous
boa-constrictor; but it didn’t know what to
do with him, as any harsh measures might
lead to insurrection. Serbia dared not go
slaying Italian subjects and an Italian bard
of great tonnage for fear the whole of
Italy would fall on it, despite the efforts
of the Government at Rome to drag it back
by- the coat-tail. Thus Serbia was at a
dead-end. So the bard remained month
after month in undisturbed insurrection, and
the fact that Fiume was supposed to be
Serb faded out of people’s minds, and the
Dago occupation became a habit, and the
heated nations cooled down. Then, the time
being ripe, an Italian army brushed away
the now superfluous forerunner, who proved
not formidable, after all, and entered into
possession. And if that army forgets to
come away the world may easily forget also.
There is a streak of romance about that
manner of doing things. When Thomas
Mcllwraitii wanted Papua in 1883 it never
occurred to him to send Roderic Quinn
ahead with the flag, Roderic figuring as a
pirate who had become demented, and then
rush an army of occupation across osten-
sibly to dislodge Roderic. Mcllwraitii
was a plain man ; and, besides, Roderic was
too young then.
The Shearers’ Magna Charta.
The first faint indications begin to appear
that the oligarchs who run the Labor move-
ment in Australia are being found out. For
years the Trades Hall officials in (say) Syd-
ney have wielded powers analogous to those
of (for example) King John of England and
his friends. They have been able to ruin men
for advocating certain policies— e.g., con-
scription—or for taking certain actions, such
as joining the 0.8. U. The barons who drew
up Magna Charta are generally represented
as unselfish patriots who had the interests of
the nation at heart. In point of fact they
were class-conscious unionists like shearers
or barristers. They were concerned only
with the privileges of what we call the
bourgeoisie. Practically all of them belonged
to this section. That is to say, they never
willingly went to Court —just as mere well-
to-do Australians refrain from writing their
names in Government House books —yet, on
the other hand, they did not engage in the
least remunerative callings. The rights of
the 60 per cent, of the nation who were serfs
interested them no more than the rights of
a blackleg ship-steward might interest a
true-blue and financial member of the Wharf
Laborers’ Union, or than the wrongs of a
militant wharf-laborer might interest Mr.
W. M. Hughes at the present stage of his
remarkable career. The unionist barons of
Australia suffer, as regards the administra-
tion of their kingdom—that of Labor- —under
many of the disabilities which afflicted their
mediaeval prototypes. Hundreds if not thou-
sands of them can never get near enough to
the central authority to influence it. Thus
a charge may be and often is laid against a
member of the A.W.U. involving industrial
and social excommunication which cannot
be adjudicated by a mass meeting of the
organisation as provided for in its con-
stitution. In such cases, the executive
exercises its alternative right of judgment.,
Australian unionists, or some of them,
have recognised, as some of England’s barons
did seven centuries ago, that so much power
should not be left in the hands of kings or
bureaucrats who are indistinguishable in the
essentials. A motion has accordingly been
placed on the agenda paper for the annual
Trades Hall convention which meets this
month providing that every financial member
of the A.W.U. who is charged with an offence
involving any punishment from a fine up-
wards shall have the right to be tried by a
jury of his peers. The jury system is not
infallible. Far from it. But it is an in-
finitely better arrangement than that of leav-
ing both the finding and the sentence to a
little clique who lack both legal training
and the judicial mind, and who are under
the domination usually of one strong man.
Had the British medical profession handled
some of its more delicate problems—the case,
for example, of the estimable old physician
who was struck off the register recently
for acting as anaesthetist for Mr. Barker
—a scandal and an act of injustice would
probably have been averted at the same
time. In any great organisation—shear-
ing, doctoring, the law or what not —
where the right to punish severely .is
claimed and exercised, the effect of a jury
must be to bring about at the worst a sort ‘of
decentralisation of tyranny. The advantage
of that should need no argument.

time professionally in N. S. Wales within the next
five years. The psychology of the sudden rush for
medicine and law is still a mystery. Arthur
Robinson lately drew attention in Melbourne to the
poor incomes earned by solicitors, instancing £3OO
per allium as quite a usual thing, a sum that any
self-respecting coal-miner in these days would look
upon with contempt; but there will be worse things
in store for those who have commenced their medi-
cal course, and financial depths will be reached that
will make £3OO per annum look quite a respectable
income if the warnings so repeatedly given as to
the black outlook for professional men are. not
taken to heart by parents and by ambitions youths.
The condition of things in the medical profession
deserves the widest publicity in order to prevent
a debiicle. It is to be sincerely hoped that the
raising of University fees by' 50 per cent., and the
wholesale “posts” and “plucks ” that took place
in August, will act as a deterrent to the numerous
voyageurs who had embarked on the troubled sea
of a medical career, and that the setback which
half of the students received will cause them to
search their minds to ascertain if they have not
made a serious mistake in selecting medicine as a
career. They have the chance of turning back
before it is too late.
The next five years will see a record put up, by
the State in the matter of new medical graduates,
and there will be no corresponding increase in the
number of patients. There are nearly 1000 medi-
cal undergraduates on the roll of our University—
-980 to be precise—and what are we to do with this
horde when the time comes for them to be let loose?
With any luck at all, the University will be turning
out 160 graduates every year for the next five
years, and a couple of dozen would fill all the
resident hospital appointments that are open. Where
are the remaining doctors to get the requisite
experience for their life work? The University
course is merely a preliminary canter, and a resi-
dent appointment is a sine qua non if the newly-
fledged medico is to succeed scientifically, and, as a
rule, financially. The bulk of the crowd will be
out in the cold, and unless they have the grit to
spend a couple of years extra in the dissecting-
room their dream of becoming accomplished sur- <
geons will fade like a pillar of cloud. In time,
they will be mere followers -of routine, mere drug-
prescribers, whose duties (such are the tactics
adopted by people to save expense) will be chiefly
to attend to children in articulo mortis, or spend
anxious hours at home on the look-out for “catch
confinements.” Truly a dreary picture to contem-
plate, but a truthful one, nevertheless. A few’ of
the new army after graduation will migrate to the
Old Country to better themselves in the eyes of the
public by obtaining the F.R.C.S. (Edin.), after a
year or so of study, but will jib at the F.R.C.S.
(Eng.) as too tough a proposition; others will go
for a D.P.I-1., or will have a shot at X-ray work, or
microbiology, in the hope of working up a consult-
ing connection on their return. But for the great
majority there will be nothing but unremitting toil
and the pickings of general practice, w'hich are
getting less every year. One doctor who had settled
on a Northern River has left it because during the
last six months four fresh doctors had commenced
practice in his district There was no room for
them, either, but they live on in the hope of making
ends meet. Such cases could be easily multiplied in
the country, and as for the suburbs they are simply
packed.

The Millstone of Ireland.
Private building for small people in N. S.
Wales was nearly finished under the old
Fair Rents law, for when a man can get 1
per cent, more for his money in Govern-
ment securities why should he want to have
tenants on his mind? The new Act piles up
restrictions and will about finish the work
and leave the Government the only house-
provider ; and the Government says it can’t
find the money. The genesis of the move-
ment, or one reason of the movement, which
threatens to reduce the State to sleeping
under a cotton gamp in the open may be
traced perhaps in this way:—
Prior to 1881, when reform commenced, the Irish
agricultural tenant was and had long been a unique
sample of misery and downtroddenness. In a land
where manufactures and commerce were rare, the
one ambition was to get the use of a bit of land on
any terms. So in the fierce competition the tenant
had a one year’s lease, no rights in his improvements
and a rent-bill which left him nothing to live on.
Therefore Ireland was the one country in the
world where the landlord and the Devil were always
synonymous terms.
The present N. S. Wales Government majority or
its parent grew up in Ireland in this landlord-Devil
atmosphere and brought it here with them, being
themselves of the oppressed class.
These facts help to explain why the Ma
State may have to sleep out. And to
hereditary instinct may also be traced
the bitterness against the trading and
manufacturing and financial section of
the community, and especially against
companies, which turns Attorney-General
McTiernan’s soul to gall and his heart to
a grindstone. They constitute the middle
class, and until the other day, when signs
,of a change began to appear, the Irish,
like the Poles, had no appreciable middle
class. There was the landlord, often a
stranger and absentee, up above. There
was the small, impoverished tenant farmer
down below. In between these might be
the priest, the petty trader, the small pub-
lican, the informer of melodrama and some
sundries, but the middle (what there was
of it) was mostly Scottish or English, just
as in Poland it was Hun or Hebrew. In
the scarcity of manufactures, shipping and
international finance there wasn't much
middle, and more especially every company
of importance repreisented alien capital. So
men of the LdCfIHUS and McTiebnan kind
only follow blindly in the footsteps of their
fathers; also in the footsteps of their train-
ing.
About the Importation of Houses.
Serious (perfectly serious) attention may
soon be given to the importation of houses
in their complete form, furnished or unfur-
nished. It is a cotmmon assertion that short
Hours, the devotion of all Saiuruay to expen-
sive sport and the rigid limitation of the
number of skilled artisans don’t lead to
reduction of output! Also, it is asserted
that the go-slow doesn’t exist, though big
ships have ceased calKng at one or two ports
because the loading process there takes twice
or thrice as many hd>urs as aforetime, and
an average day’s bricklaying is said to have
gone d6wn from oven 800 bricks to below
450. In many lines decrease of produc-
tion isn’t apparent to -people who don’t read
statistics, for the moueness of imports dis-
guises the lessness of 'local output. In the
course of the Jul.v-Sephember quarter N. S.
Wales imported £18,700,000 worth of goods,
which was £10,300,000 more than in July-
AFTER THE BAWL.
( A. Hazy Recollection of a Sitting in the N.S.W. Assembly.)
September, 1919, and it handed down some
millions of debt to the children to help pay
for them. That disguised a heap of local
unproductiveness. But no complete houses
were imported, notwithstanding the frightful
and increasing house-famine. Why not?
A big cargo tramp might carry a cottage or
two as deck cargo. A specially-constructed
ship with large openings to the lower deck —
that is to say, the upper cargo deck —which
openings would be solidly closed and fast-
ened at sea, could fill up with houses very
considerably. They would have telescopic
chimneys, to save space. They would be on
permanent wheels. They would be rolled
aboard on wheels, and live through the voyage
on them. (This wuuld leave room underneath
for the drain-pipes.) They would be rolled
ashore and on to their destination on the
same wheels. Arrived there they would slide
on wheels down a gentle incline into the
shallow foundation-hole, or the deep founda-
tion-hole if the bottom storey was a cellar,
and 'planted there, wheels and all. This
would be handy in case of later removal.
Light goods could be packed in the house'
during the voyage, or the premises might be
let in suites to passengers, so that they would
earn part of their passage. Two-stoney
buildings (on wheels) could be towed here
on rafts in the same way as rafts of timber
are towed. The only drawback seems to be-
that the back yards couldn’t be imported, too.
A thousand houses, landed at £lOOO each,
or 2500 cheap Chinese-labor houses at £4OO
each, brought to Sydney every quarter, would
only be £1.000.000. and a State that has
imported £18,700.000 worth of goods in a
quarter wouldn’t notice a trifle like that.
The beauty of the scheme is that neither
Laborites, Socialists. Bolsheviks. Communists
nor Anarchists would object. However much
they may persecute and hamper the makers
of Australian products, it is their policy to
make no serious objection in the matter of
imported products, whether they he white,
black, browm or yellow; union or non-union ;
long hour or short hour; long wage or short
wage; or even if they are made where an
apprentice is allowed to every adult worker
instead of one to every tlu;pe. We can't
import mines or post-holes, but houses are
possible. Melbourne, having wide, level
streets for a drove of domiciles to travel
along, should be a good place at which to
land the experimental shipment. Then there
is level country far around. There seems
really no reason why an active house landed
at Melbourne or Geelong on Monday morn-
ing shouldn’t lie at Bendigo or Ballarat on
Tuesday night and be let on Wednesday.
If the matter is taken up by the Billions
Club the first terrace should be here by
Easter.
Our Ancestor Nicholas Bottom.
About 60 years ago Australia definitely took
the wrong turning and entered on a career
of which the end isn’t far off, though the
exact details of the catastrophe are uncer-
tain. In 1855 or 1860 the great bulk of
the adult population was still imported, and
might be supposed to have brought some
British ideas qf faiidy sound finance with
it. Possibly the sensation of standing up-
side down upset its ideas. More probably
the trouble lay in the fact that the early
settlers left Britain before there was any
compulsory or general education, before there
were many newspapers, and before the mass
of the people had votes or any great induce-
ment to know much about economics. So
they started afresh in the only “new” land
that began after the curse of high finance
was invented, and they developed a financial
theory that is seldom defined as clearly as
it should be, though it is still the only theory
we have. It was that no public works should
be done except out of loans even when, as
often happened, revenue money might be a
great deal easier to get and obtainable in
larger quantities. If loan money (all
foreign at first) weren’t procurable public
works stopped though our own money might
be lying around in heaps. Now and then
it was admitted (though nothing much came
of the admission) that a sinking fund to pay
off debt was a good thing, but the idea of a
fund that sank first so as to prevent there
being debt to pay off was outside all cal-
culations. Between 1871 and 1881 the debt
of the six States which are now the Com-
monwealth grew at the rate of a mere
£3.600,000 a year. Direct taxation, which
now is £6 or more, in 18S1 was ss. lid.
per inhabitant per annum ; land and income
taxes, probate duties and stamp duties were
almost unknown, and local taxation was
almost unknown likewise. On the then
population an increase of tax to fl
15s. lid. would have made borrowing
quite unnecessary, and as works mul-
tiplied, the revenue from which wasn’t
eaten up by interest, it would have remained
unnecessary. A burden of 355. lid., as the
imported people knew, would have been re-
garded as absurdly light in the land they
came from; but any appeal to them, if one
was made, to follow good old English finan-
cial tradition was met with the reply that
good old blanky English tradition could go
to the swinehounds, or words to that effect.
And it was explained to the inquirer that,
though Australia could and would gladly
stand any taxation to pay interest on loans,
it couldn’t, by reason of stomach complications
or something, stand even a trifling burden
for any other purpose. There have even
been cgses when taxes were reduced because
there was top much money, and at the same
time borrowing was increased because there
wasn’t enough. This is the reason why
horse or vehicular passengers who try
to leave Sydney northward have to
escape by two antiquated punts on
one route, while on another they have to
swim the Ilawkesbury (there being only a
railway bridge). Also, for .the same reason, the
retreat nor’-westerly is by archaic punt, and
that due southerly is by antiquated punt,
and in various directions it is by ante-
diluvian punt. There have been times of
plenty when money could have been found
galore to make bridges across Sydney
Harbor and Middle Harbor and the Ilawkes-
bury and George’s River, and to make
smooth roads like the roads of Paradise —
times when taxes were low arid revenue
showed a surplus, and people carried round
swags of sovereigns because they despised
paper. But it wasn’t the right kind of
money (the pure-merino loan kind), so the
environs of Australia’s biggest city are a
bridgeless, and in many places roadless, dis-
trict to this day, haunted by old punt con-
traptions such as Xerxes used. Possibly
when some new States are established they
will begin on sane lines. An impression
prevails that our ancestors didn’t come out
of England but out of “A Midsummer
Night’s Dream.” and that their name whs
Bottom— he with the eminently
appropriate head.
Thus Peter Simonoff, the representative
in Australia of “the Russian Socialist Fed-
eral Soviet Republic” ;
The difference between Tun Bulletin and most
of the others, if you’ll let me say so, is that, though
I think it is wrong, it seeks the truth, wherever it
leads. And for that reason I want to draw its
attention to two inconsistencies in the latest picture
presented of Russia. First, Sydney D.T. editorial of
December 29, 1920, says that “the other day Mr.
Lloyd George compared England to a prosperous
shopkeeper whose principal - customers had all gone
bankrupt. Europe he referred to generally as an
insolvent, shivering in tatters outside the British
market, without cash or credit with which to come
in and satisfy its needs. The position of America
and the Dominions, whose trade is also largely
dependent on the custom of the tattered insolvent, is
much the same as that of England.” But on the
next page appears the following cablegram under the
very significant heading of “A Trade Reprisal”:
“M aar tens, the unrecognised Soviet Ambassador,
whom the United States Government has ordered to
be deported, has received a cable from Tchitcherin,
Soviet Foreign Minister, ordering him to cancel all
contracts with American firms, aggregating 50,000,000
dollars, and return to Russia immediately.” Soviet
Russia is to-day neither bankrupt nor insolvent nor
shivering tattered. She has enough things tp go on
with fairly comfortably, and, besides, she is in a
position to buy from outside for hundreds of mil-
lions, nay, for thousands of millions of pounds. But
the silly shopkeeper is so scared of burglars that he
has placed at the entrance of his shop a policeman
with strict orders not to let anybody in. So his
best customer, Lady Soviet Russia, is saying now:
“To Hell with your shop if you are such an idiot! 1
can manage pretty well without your shop, if needs
be.” And I can assure you that Lady Soviet Russia
will manage her house quite comfortably without
the mad shopkeeper’s wares.
The Pussyfooters did no good in Scotland,
judging by the final figures cabled from Lon-
don :
The net result is that 447 licenses, of which 99
are in Glasgow, will be cancelled, out of 9371 in
the whole country.
Glasgow was the headquarters of all the
Scottish No-license Councils, and the centre
where the anti-refreshment movement raged
fiercest. Yet but 10 per cent, of its thou-
sand pubs are affected, and the chances are
the public would have dealt severely with
them, if given the chance, under any system.
As it is, though their licenses will be? taken
away in the sense that they will have
to shut up their bars, they will still be
allowed under the Scottish Temperance Act
(1013) to sell liquor “for consumption at
meals.” This will no doubt give rise pre-
sently to the question what is a Scotchman’s
meal in the eye of the law ; and on its inter-
pretation will depend whether the vast sums
spent on the late campaign were wholly or
only about 95 per cent, wasted.

POLITICAL
POINTS
There is an outcry for optimism; but this
paper is beginning to think that it is almost
the only real optimist in the neighborhood.
For, while the people who talk most about
optimism represent this as a poor, feckless
country which can’t pay its own way or
make its own clothes-pegs, The Bulletin
believes that Australia is well able to stand
on its own two feet and do most of its own
jobs. The optimist of the daily papers says
that Australia could have a great time if
it went often enough to the pawnshop and
signed sufficient p.-n’s. This paper’s opti-
mism is such that it believes Australia could
do without the pawnshop if it paid more
serious attention to the workshop.
Crawford Vaughan, formerly Labor Pre-
mier of S. Aus., who after doing war-work
in England spent a year in the U.S.A.
lecturing and has now come to Australia by
way of America, tells interviewers: “I am
quite convinced that the United States will
come into the League of Nations. There is
no alternative.” Also a nation has really no
alternative but to trust in Providence. Still,
some also keep their powder dry. When
they do something because they must, they
generally do something else when they can.
Compared with the roaring lion of the
general election the Storey who-found him-
self at the head of a Government was a
placid cow; and judged by the result of the
first session the cow only gives skimmed milk.
Loughlin’s Land Bill and McGirr’s subsidy
for mothers were quietly dropped out of
sight; McTiernan’s wild and woolly Pro-
fiteering Bill was shorn until its own father
couldn’t recognise it; the Faiivltents Bill be-
came a tame Willie; and for the rest the
work of the session consisted of adding a few
millions per year to the public burden and a
few thousands per year to the politicians’
pay. But though the measures the Govern-
ment talked of it didn’t pass and obviously
in some cases didn’t want to pass, enormous
damage was done to the State, nevertheless.
More than all else confidence in the future
is the thing lacking—the confidence that
would encourage men to establish new in-
dustries and extend old ones; and the Gov-
ernment killed that just as completely as if
it had passed the bills it only talked about.
The plant- that was bought seven years
ago for the World, the Sydney Labor daily,
is being overhauled, and the paper may be
hatched by the middle of the year. Members
of the A.W.U., who put up most of the
money, have been getting restless, and have
been threatening to force on action with
regard to the daily World by pulling the
props from under the weekly Worker.
Unless W. M. Hughes appoints someone
before breakfast his egg doesn’t agree with
him, and after breakfast he has to create a
new department to give him an appetite for
lunch. Hitherto the Commonwealth has
found immigrants and the State Govern-
ments have looked after them or forgotten
them on arrival. Suddenly it occurred to
Hughes that if there was a Federal as well
as a State official on the wharf the new
arrival would get two handshakes instead of
one and it would give him a more homey
feeling. So on top of the appointment of
young Gullett as director at £l5OO a year he
has appointed a batch of Federal shakers at
£550 a year each. And already one Govern-
ment (that of Westralia) has almost
threatened to throw the interfering duplicate
off the pier into the sea, and says he is an
insult and a blot on the landscape.
Now that I). L. McNamara's Iveep-your-
State-seat-warm-for-you Act has been in-
cluded in the Vic Statutes, there will be
keener competition at Senate and Rep. elec-
tions. All that the Leg. Council or Assembly
member ha.s to do is to intimate to the
President or Speaker, as the case may be,
that he will nominate afresh for his State
seat if not elected to the Commonwealth
Parliament. If the Federal electors turn him
down, he will be declared re-elected un-
opposed for his old State seat. The notion
was borrowed from the Speck, and Labor
was allowed to run through the reform,
initiating the bill in the Uppah Chamber.
Kindred feelings make politicians wondrous
kind —to one another.
The goose that used to lay most of the
golden eggs at Darwin is going to stay out
of business for some time. O. W. D.
Conacher, who manages for Yestey’s, has been
to London to consult his firm, and it has de-
cided that there shall be no killing in the
season that ought to begin next April. This
means at least two years of unemployment
with a £1,000.000 plant lying idle. Mean-
while the A.W.U. and the A.M.I.E.U. have
been fighting over the few fragments of work
that remain and the reversion of the jobs that
may come along the year after next; and

A note from the West: —
Westralian finance rushes from bad to worse.
Regardless of Parliament and the Audit Act the
hilarious persons who inhabit the Treasury have got
into the way of advancing public money to private
persons — c.g., stranded trippers in London and east-
ward-bound politicians’ wives—without publishing
particulars or asking for the usual authority. The
Auditor-General has plaintively protested again and
again, but Parliament takes no notice. In his latest
report the official bitterly observes that “the con-
tinuance of the practice must be taken as an indi-.
THE CARAVAN MOVES ON.
cation that Parliament desires no alteration.” He
is quite right; modern Parliaments will stand any-
thing. When John Forrest was Treasurer he laid it
down that every Westralian loan must carry a sink-
ing fund. The Forrest precedent was followed more
or less faithfully till 1916, when the Scaddan deficit
became chronic and the late Frank Wilson funded
it. Wilson’s idea was to issue Treasury bonds to
the amount of the deficiency and to provide a special
sinking fund out of revenue, but Wilson died and
the sinking fund idea died with him. Nowadays the
funded deficit amounts to nearly a tenth of the
ordinary debt, but the Auditor-General despairingly
notes that it carries no sinking fund. Interest on
. the deficit runs into about a quarter of a million a
year. Apparently the Government meets it by issu-
ing more Treasury bonds.
No Queensland Government has had much
worse things said about it by the crowd
than Theodore’s had when, after putting thou-
sands of supporters on to railway jobs, and
scraping the Treasury and the loan market
bare, and doubling or trebling the taxes, the
supply of easy billets ran out, just as the
farseeing Premier Ryan ran out when he
saw the storm coming. Much the same lan-
guage begins to be used to Storey’s Minis-
try in N. S. Wales. Between loans and
new taxes, none of which fall on its direct
supporters, that body is trying to find an
extra 10 or 12 millions per annum, and
handing it out royally and promiscuously.
Yet already it is talked to by Garden and
other authorities as if it had been found with
the stolen will concealed about it, because
there are allegedly 15,000 unemployed around
who ought to be appointed to the civil ser-
vice immediately. George Dibbs of old times,
who used to answer with damns, was treated
more civilly. But, then, Dibbs was the other
fellow’s nigger, and a man only wallops his
own nigger.
From one of the leading publicists of the
TJ.S.A. (on the Eastern side, too) :
Our people are getting very much heated up over
the Japanese question, and, unfortunately, this is
turning into an anti-British feeling, due to the
fact that Great Britain is allied with Japan. We
feel ourselves in the same situation as Germany was
when she was in between Russia and France, and
since like causes produce like effects it is to be
feared that in the course of time we may get to
behave as badly as Germany. The Irish question
makes more noise, of course, but I think the Japan-
ese alliance is much more dangerous as a source
of American ill-feeling towards Great Britain.
On the other hand Maxse, of the National
Review, who has proved himself one of the
clearest visioned men in England, sends a
plea to Australia to support the alliance.
The question arises whether a fair view of
the position is being presented to the
U.S.A. —whether, in plain words, the Irish-
American party is not using its tremendous
power in the States to make this trouble for
England, and incidentally for us —especially
for us. Which is another argument to
throw in the scale in favor of cutting the
Irish entanglement adrift.
What is most the matter with the Aus-
tralian Labor leader of to-day is that he
either can’t or doesn’t want to see that a
nation may be a poor wage-slave, too. And
whereas the individual worker generally has
to toil for the advantage of sojnebody who
lives alongside him and is more or less con-
cerned about his welfare, a nation is liable
to get into bonds to a foreigner, who doesn’t
care two pins how it has to sweat to pro-
duce his interest or his dividends. Ten years
ago, just before the Labor parties began to
get into power in the States, the total public
debt was £257,000,000. To-day, apart from the
vast debt for which the war was responsible,
the country owes approximately £440.000,000.
The first Labor Government came into
office in N. S. Wales at the end of 1910.
in over 100 years up to that time the State
had borrowed £93,000.000. It has since
borrowed —in 10 years—-£85,000,000 ; and
that is apart from what the Commonwealth
has borrowed on its behalf. The nation
that goes into debt simply undertakes to
do a certain amount of work for the lender
—i.e., produce for him a certain amount of
interest. So the very party which has talked
most about freeing the wage-slave has done
most to sell him into work-slavery, and,
worse still, largely to a foreign owner.
When N. S. Wales Treasurer Lang put
his two-million loan on the market he had
one day of misguided cock-a-doodle-do and no
more. That was when two State institutions,
which probably couldn’t help themselves, put
a heap d"f trust money into his 5J per cent,
investment when they could have got more
like 8 per cent, with much better (Federal)
security. After that there were no rinore
figures and no more sounds like a new laid
egg. Of course the loan had to be taken up,
even if Lang bought the left-over bonds out of
revenue, giving his lOTJ for them ; but he
wasn’t a cheerful noise to hear at Christmas,
and his struggle shows that some other means
of providing the people with work must be
found. Loans obviously can’t be trusted.
Once every 24 hours John Storey, the
Premier (without portfolio) at £2445 a year,
has hi.s leg pulled by the Sydney morning
papers, or else he pulls it himself and sends
them the resulting music. It is exactly like
the discourse of the innkeeper in “Barnaby
Budge”—not news, but ponderous comment,
complaints and replies to critics. Recently
he even got down to answering at great and
wooden length a mild newspaper scribe who
had signed his letter with initials, and
another who called himself “A Working
Man.” John has little to do, or he wouldn’t
have time to argue with all the small fry
in the correspondence column ; little sense of
the dignity of his office, else he wouldn t
brawl with all and sundry; little brilliance,
or he would brawl better. And he is utterly
oblivious to the size of the country he is
called on to govern, or he wouldn’t make lire
a dull squabble between himself and two
“capitalistic” rags published within a
half-mile of his office. It is good for the
general manager of a great concern to be
affable and approachable. At the same time
he shouldn’t, as a regular thing, play
marbles and drink ginger-beer with the office-
boy.
“P. Pilate” re an outburst in the Senate:
There are few members, including the Speaker and
President, who can honestly swear that they have
never attempted to use influence on behalf of some
billet-hunter. Even in the engagement of typists
and menials there are invariably rumors of unfair
preference. Some doubts are inevitable when the
selection of the Parliamentary staffs is left in the
hands of the Speaker and President. Both may want
to do the right thing, but to stand for implacable
honesty in appointments against the will of some
Minister or powerful private member of the party
which has supplied their rosy jobs, argues a heroism
which neither Johnson nor Givens possesses. As a
matter of fact, the whole business of these appoint-
ments should be taken out of their hands. Givens’S
unsympathetic attitude to his toilers, coupled with
his arrogance, would easily produce a strike outside.
Here he simply drives them to ventilate their
grievances through members in both Houses.
Not only did Victoria’s House of Land-
lords smell the carcase; to the horror of a
few of the old group, members swooped
down on it and had a peck. A motion
declaring that each member should get £2OO
a year was carried by 16 votes to 10. In-
cluding a pair, 17 votes, or just half of the
House, were mustered. The minority, of
course, comprised the all-wools. But the
Government is very shy, and its present idea
is to take no steps to vote the money till
the people have been consulted.
General McCay, as he crooned the swan
song of the Vic. Fair Profits Commission,
asked that there should be “no flowers.”
Like Emmet, he claimed the charity of the
world’s silence. Truth to tell, there is
nobody in a hurry to shower “floral tri-
butes” on the Commission's grave. McCay
has other things to fall back upon. Sam
Hutchinson, whose brother is no longer a
Minister of the Crown, can, of course,
return to his storekeeping. But the Trades
Hall was not waiting outside to recapture
Charlie Gray, the third member.
Our borrowing Ministers should find new
gags, for the old ones have become mouldy
and hackneyed and an outrage on the human
understanding. Take this regular sample by
N. S. Wales Treasurer Lang, buzzing round
after his three-million loan to keep the Gov-
ernment with its vastly-increased salaries in
its motor-cars, and its Premier and family
on a six-months’ holiday trip at the public
expense:—
The soundest and speediest way of settling the
problems confronting the State is to encourage
inland development and settlement as rapidly as pos-
sible. This means increased production, which, in
turn, entails more employment, thus meeting the
present unemployment difficulty and providing room
for a sound immigration policy. Inland settlement
and development must accompany essential public
works construction. Every line of . completed rail-
ways will mean greater production and sooner or
later increased settlement.
Every day there is the same piece, with im-
perceptible variations —“development,” “set-
tlement,” “production,” “reproductive”
“developmental,” “emxdoyment,” “resources”
and all the other familiar booming sounds.
A bittern says exactly the same thing in a
swamp at feeding-time, and says it better.
“Bildad”: One reason why I don’t
want Alderman Bramston’s republic (B.
28/12/’2O), though I have always been a
believer in republics, is that I don’t like the
new sham who calls himself a republican.
Among all the conspicuous users of the term
in Australia to-day I don’t know one who
isn’t a glaring fraud and embryo tyrant.
They are Direct Actionists —believers in
abolition of peaceful majority rule and the
substitution of violent, bloody, dishonest
minority rule, with themselves or people of
their sort as chief thieves and murderers.
In fact, they want something much less like
a republic than we have now. In 110 years
of Mexican history there was only one
President (the great Juarez) who was elected
honestly and above board who lasted out
his term, and he was also almost the only
civilian on the list. In the- absence of an
army to run violent usurpations, the One Big
Union, as the most solid organised force,
would be expected to make and unmake
Presidents. The British connection is the
only certain thing that stands between the
Walshes and Considines and Gardens and
Brookfields and Bramstons and the dream of
a good time when they would take turns at
playing the part of Barrios and Santa Ana
and Guzman Blanco and other picturesque
adventurers —Direct Actionists who ran “re-
publics” with great violence and profited
thereby.

Big changes have taken place since the
E., 8. and A. accounts closed on June 30,
and the figures in the last line are of little
more interest than as additional evidence of
how the wind blew during the previous 12
months. A few weeks after the term closed
the directors of the E., S. and A. and of
the London of Australia, having decided
that the time had arrived when an amal-
gamation would be-of mutual advantage,
agreed to a proposal whereby the larger con-
cern should acquire the other’s shares. The
amalgamation was to take place il holders
of 90 p.c. of the nominal value of the Lon-
don’s subscribed shares approved by October
1. Altogether well over the requisite nine-
tenths agreed to take E., 8. and A. scrip and
a little cash (to adjust differences between
the respective fchare interests), and the
amalgamation is now being consummated.
But it is a slow process, and the London
Bank, though now under E., S. and A.
general-manager Wren, still hangs out its
shingle independently except in a couple of
country centres in Victoria, where both
banks operated. Though each had been in
business since ’52 it is curious that except
in the capital cities there was practically no
overlapping of branches; in N. 8. Wales they
have 91 branches between them and not a
clash; in Vic. they competed with each
other in only three centres, though between
them there were 114 branches. General-
manager Wren is thus not faced with many
difficulties outside the capitals; his greatest
trouble apparently will be to get all the
London’s securities under the E., S. and A.
seal and clear the way for the liquidator to
wind up the former concern.
Precisely how the capital account of the
enlarged E., S. and A. Bank will stand is
not clear. At June 30 paid capital was
£560,047 in 43,155 £25 shares paid to
£l2 10s. each, and 20,610 more in process
of being paid up to the same amount, but on
which only £1 had been called. Except for
a small parcel of shares fully paid to £22
10s. the London’s ordinary and pref. scrip
was paid to £lO, paid capital totalling
£794,785. Both classes of London £lO
holders had the right to accept five E., S. and
A. shares (£l2 10s. paid) for every nine of
their shares, the ords. also receiving £1 per
share in cash and the prefs. £2 per share, the
latter having the right, . alternatively, of
taking £l3 in cash in full settlement. The
new E., S. and A. paid capital thus depends
on how the London’s shareholders elect to
surrender their scrip. Besides its paid
capital the enlarged E., S. and A. will still
have nearly millions of cheap stock to
work on. When it crashed in the ’nineties
depositors were forced to accept in place of
their good cash various brands of stock,
roughly one-fourth each of 4 p.c. debentures,
4 p.c. terminable deposit receipts, 3 p.c. per-
petual inscribed stock and redeemable
deferred stock carrying a maximum p.c.
The deposit receipts have long since been
met, but the management is still obliged
to set aside portion of each year’s profits
(one-fourth after making various deductions)
to redeem the deferred stuff. This stock is
purchased in the open market, where, natu-
rally, since it carries only 4J p.c.. it is at a
heavy discount. For instance, £17,981 set
aside out of the 1919 profits purchased
£22.500 worth. As this stock disappears it
is struck off the book value of premises, the
amounts thus disappearing being shown as
written off in the introductory table, the
profit made on sale of the stock also being
shown in a separate column. How the old
deposit accounts have been met is shown
next: —

For all practical purposes that £2,462,966
represents very cheap pref. capital.
In the following table, combining the latest
balance-sheet figures of the E., S. and A. (to
June last) arid the London (to Dec., 1919),
this old debt has not been included as a lia-
bility (it ranks after new liabilities if the
worst should happen) :

No doubt the London’s figures expanded dur-
ing the half-year and the totals were larger
at June than those shown in the last
column. But over 20 millions of deposits
take the new E., S. and A. into sixth place
among Australian proprietary banks. Latest
balance-sheets show the total liabilities of
the leaders as: Wales, 67* millions; Union,
354 millions; Commercial of Sydney,. 31$
millions; Australasia, 28i millions; National
of Australia, 244 millions; with the E., S.
and A. following close.

If in the Australia v. England cricket tests
the public was denied all details except the
aggregate runs knocked up by both sides, the
score-card would be just about as informative
to-cricket enthusiasts as are the Henry Jones
Co-op. accounts to its supporters. This co.
gets its income from jam and incidental side-
lines, but it does not itself produce or sell a
single pot. It owns the shares in a team of
factories, each of which has an independent
existence and passes on to the parent con-
cern so much of its profits as the parent may
care to take. As to the individual perform-
ance of the members in the team the public
is told nothing. It is now 11 years since the
partners in the Henry Jones business, of
Hobart and Melbourne, saw the advantages
of organising the industry and manufacturing
in centres where different fruits were in
greatest abundance. But instead of estab-
lishing new factories in competition with
old enterprises, Henry Jones and his long-
headed lieutenant, Acli. Palfreyman, set about
creating a holding co. which would take over
the shares in the Jones group and then
gradually acquire interests in established
businesses further afield. In this way the
Australian Jam Co., Ltd., and Iloadley’s
Pty., Ltd., both of Melbourne, the Peacock
Jam Co.. Ltd., of Sydney, and others were
brought under the wing. The expansion of
the enterprise has been remarkable, and in
addition to its Australian interests the co.
now runs a factory in S’Africa, and a few
months ago began canning in California.
Ten years ago “shares and interests in jam
manufacturing and fruit preserving cos. and
timber mills” stood at just under half a
million; the latest entry is £1.047,779. At
the first balance 428,992 £1 shares were
shown as having been issued to acquire in-
terests in goine- concerns, while the public
had put up £71,000 in cash. The former
item has since expanded to £434.747 and
cash-paid share interests to £298,009, the
new share issues bringing in £7195 by way
of premiums.
All shareholders are told is that income
earned in the Commonwealth last year was
£104,746, that interest on War Loans added
£3285, and that enterprises outside the Com-
monwealth brought in £18,396. Expenses
absorbed under £3OOO. and since the remain-
ing £123,365 of profit gave a div. of 124
p.c., and then left for reserves an amount
equal to another 44 p.c. on capital, there
will be no complaints from shareholders re-
garding the meagre information proffered
concerning the performances of subsidiary
enterprises. All the directors remark is
that the “production, sales and profits have
been well maintained in all of the Austra-
lian factories, and South Africa has again
done remarkably well.’’ As to the ’Murkan
concern, they do not anticipate any “sub-
stantial” profits “for some years, at least” ;
meantime shareholders are “assured that the
funds in this venture are perfectly safe.”
There is a hint there that by-and-bye the
co. may be expected to do even more mag-
nificently than it has done in the past. But
there are several factors which the investor
needs to consider. Australian-manufactured
jam is nowadays far in excess of local re-
quirements, and that means that concerns
like Henry Jones’s have to nurse an export
trade. We have the fruit all right, but
ample sugar supplies are not at all certain ;
nor is it clear how the products of highly-
paid Australian jam-makers and of white-
grown sugar will fare in the world’s markets
in future.
A feature of the latest balance-sheet is the
expansion during the year of interests in
other cos., etc., from £674,764 to £1,047,779,
which was not wholly financed by new
capital got in. Twelve months ago jsub-
sidiaries owed the parent concern £37,068
net; at the latest balance the parent was in
debt to the subsidiaries to the extent of
£172,262. From that it would appear that
some of the resources of individual con-
cerns in the group have been utilised by the
principal co. to extend the interests of
others. The published accounts, however,
give no inkling of the strength of the various
contributories or what profits, if any, they
have withheld from the parent concern. It is
not unlikely that while the parent has been
accumulating £168,507 of reserves, the family
has also been putting a bit aside. But on
all such matters nothing definite can be
ascertained ; only those right inside know the
precise standing of Henry Jones Co-op.,

The Hotel Sydney continues to do well: the
past half’s gross profits of £20,709 were a
record, but taxes having taken a larger cut,
and extensions, repairs and maintenance
having called for a little more, the latest net
profits were not so good as those for the
April term. Still, if profits can be main-
tained at this level after providing for all
necessary charges (amortisation of lease,
etc.), there is going to be a fine feast for
both the 8 p.c. prefs. and the ordinaries,
for the former are to follow the latter to
10 p.c., and latest disclosed net profits are
ample to pay prefs. that rate and then leave
70 p.c. for ordinaries. But, in spite of all
that, neither prefs. nor ords. have had a
taste so far. The concern started off under
difficulties. The promoters depended mostly
on pref. capital to finance construction and
ecfuipment, but notwithstanding the cumula-
tive 8 p.c. offered and the promise of two
points more if ordinaries did well, insuffi-
cient funds were forthcoming from the pub-
lic. At April, 1916, paid capital was
£44,924, of which £5OOO represented ordinary
shares issued to the vendors of the City
Council leasehold and the balance the pub-
lic’s preference subscriptions. The build-
ings, lease and plant, etc., had run away
with £83,000, and to finance this and current
trading the directors had to put all assets
into pawn. At that date the hotel build-
ings were mortgaged for £25,000, £20,000
of debentures had been issued, and to its
bankers and others over £12,500 was due.
Meantime trading losses had run up the
deficit (i.e., the amount of capital unrepre-
sented by tangible, assets) to over £BOOO.
But when profits did begin to show up and
wipe out accumulated losseh, the directors
had also to prepare for the liquidation of
liabilities. Profit's have been applied to the
reduction Of debt in this way:—

Excess liabilities ..£55,302 £37,098 £16,838
During the past half the ordinaries sub-
scribed a further £lO,OOO of capital, on
the issue of which they had reserved an option
at flotation. The co.’s position from the
point of view of creditors had thus been
improved in a commendable way. Mean-
time, though, shareholders have had no divi-
dend whatever; out of the profits of the
past 18 months the directors have declared
pref. divs. covering the period from Dec.,
1913, almost to date, but not a penny has
been passed out. The reserves shown in the
first table and the greatly reduced excess of
liabilities are, therefore, subject to the
deferred divs. on the pref. shares, altogether
£22,300. Except probably for £7577 over-
draft and perhaps portion of the £4107 of
sundry creditors, deltfs have now been re-
duced to fairly comfortable dimensions, and
profits should soon be available for share-
holders. To shake off another £lO,OOO of
debt and meet all arrears of pref. divs.
should be possible within three years at the
present rate of going; that is, of course,
unless further funds are required for exten-
sions or structural alterations, and so forth.
If everything continues to work out well,
later on, no doubt, the directors will deem
it advisable to consider the effect the utilisa-
tion of profit for debt-redemption has had
on the capital account. Profits so far have
been employed to reduce borrowed capital,
and that is making profit-earning easier and
adding to the shareholders’ interest in the
enterprise. #

The links between the old and new cos. are
not well defined. Twelve months ago there
were visible reserves of £3860 after payment
of divs., and apparently that and the balance
of profit for the six months to April 30 last
after payment of an interim div. were, swal-
lowed in the reconstruction. Shareholders
in May assented to the directors’ proposal to
“bring the capital up to a sum commensurate
with the present value of the assets held and
used in its business.” Old paid capital was
£75,000, and this was doubled by an issue of
a similar amount of bonus shares. To pro-
vide this scrip necessitated the writing-up of
assets by approximately £71,000. Evidently
there have also been additions to fixed assets
since the last balance, for building, machin-
ery, plant, stores, etc., now stand in the
books at £117,907, compared with £42.559
12 months ago, an increase of £75,348, and
that may have been after writing off some-
thin!' for depreciation. These depreciath
allowances in the past were apparently very
liberal; anyhow, between 1916-19 the book
value of fixed assets was reduced from
£01.629 to £42,559, though there was n >
visible sale. How much of the bonus capi-
tal became available by writing back, or
whether something was provided by taking
credit for inflated values, is not apparent,
of course. But the result of the shuffle is
that the directors are now able to pay divs.
at the rate of 10 p.c. on the enlarged capi-
tal, making the return on the old register
equal to 20 p.c. p.a. And that does not take
into account the £lO,OOO of profits capital-
ised four years ago. Twelve months ago
the “Wild Cat” showed how rapidly the
liquid position was being improved, but dur-
ing the past year apparently renewals, or
possibly extensions, have cut into the liquid
surplus

The ways of the big C.S.R. continue
mysterious. Early in November share-
holders in the M.L. and Fiji subsidiary co.
were told that it “seemed clear” that there
was little likelihood of the Fiji interests
requiring further funds in the early future,
and that the directors had decided to return
£lO per £2O pref. share, together with a
premium of 255. per share. Now a curt
note has gone out to shareholders to say
that 1 circumstances have arisen which
render desirable the postponement of action
in the matter. Moreover, it may be neces-
sary to modify the scheme suggested, and
no date can be fixed for proceeding there-
with.”
* * * #
As the year 1921 opens the base metal
industry of the Commonwealth is found
lying across the industrial path. It looks
like a corpse, but how much is really corpse
and how much can be galvanised into profit-
able activity by intelligent treatment will
probably not be known for a few months
rev i ew of the mining industry for
1920, therefore, savors of an inquest. ’ The
mines producing lead, copper or tin, despite
the ever-increasing wages costs, were, where
the miners would work at all, capable of
carrying on as long as the relatively high
metfil prices lasted. In November, however,
the slump began to assert itself, and by the
end of the year nearly every mining concern
was sending out SOS signals. In a purely
academic sense the two apparent factors
governing the position are the wages cost
(which also means fuel cost) and the price
of the refined metal. Australian politicians
consider they or the unions control the
former, and that some huge black monster
controls the latter. As a matter of fact they
are wrong in each case, for the seasons and
the disposition of the people of the earth to
work control both.
Getting. down to local facts the Aus-
tralian mines are to-day right up against it
because the local politicians have never
attempted to establish the unit of work.
There are relatively very few miners on the
Australian horizon who dare openly advocate
the contract system, and the honest worker
is soon converted to the stupid view that the
ore he fails to take out to-day remains for
to-morrow. The men themselves are not
wholly to blame. Looked at from a national
standpoint those controlling the principal
lead, copper and\ gold mines have by their
narrow and often selfish views hastened
the evil day. The blunders of the Federal
Government during the war knocked out all
the small producers, and -the larger concerns
made no effort to save them. Short of trained
miners themselves, they were always ready to
absorb any men who were temporarily
"putting the acid” on some other show by
strike methods.
Of the base-metal mines within the
Commonwealth the silver-lead producers
are in point of value the most important.
Under normal working conditions the
Broken Hill mines can readily account for
150,000 tons of refined lead per annum, and
given good conditions could possibly ap-
proach the 200,000-ton mark. The refineries
(Port Pirie and Cockle Creek) could readily
take that tonnage, and still find room for
the lead ores of the smaller producers. Dur-
ing 1920, however, Broken Hill was on strike,
and on an assumed output of 150,000 tons
of pig lead at £3O per ton —the approximate
average price for the year 1918—our mineral
returns on this line alone are short by
£4,500,000. Add to this the silver that
would have been recovered, say 7,500,0000 z.
at 45., and the shortage is increased by
£1,500,000. The average prices for the
year 1918 are taken to arrive at these values
because in that year Broken Hill was work-
ing. Its production assumed for 1920 at
100.000 tons in a world’s total of roughly
1,000,000 tons would have affected the market
to some extent. The average price of lead
for 1920, when Broken Hill was not
working, _ approximated £3B Is. 4d. per
ton. If it had been working the lead market
might have been £8 per ton% easier. On this
basis, by reason of the Broken Hill strike it
may be safely said our mineral returns for
the year were reduced by £6,000,000 in value.
The strike, however, cannot be blamed for any
shortage in spelter production. Speak-
ing in a purely zinc sense it has probably
been a blessing. Prior to the war, Aus-
tralia was producing annually about 400,000
tons of zinc concentrates containing approxi-
mately 185,000 tons of spelter per annum.
These were treated abroad. Although laud-
able efforts have since been made to provide
works for treating these concentrates in Aus-
tralia, and extensions to the works at Risdon
are still proceeding, stocks of concentrates
have piled up, and if Broken Hill resumes
they will continue to pile up. W. M.
Hughes was reported to have sold to the
British Government for 10 years after the
war thfe exportable surplus of Australian
zinc concentrates. Nobody seems to be sure
of that contract, but if the announcement is
quite reliable, then the British Government
is not making much of a fist at treating the
stuff. In three years Great Britain took
only 66,70 S tons, whereas 149,784 tons had
to be shipped to Japan, 151,686 tons to
America, and 14,000 tons each to Canada
and France. Probably Prime Minister
Hughes has decided that Japan and the
United States are, after all, a part of the
British Empire. Certainly they are taking
a fair share of Australia in the form of zinc
concentrates, with John Bull acting as the
selling agent.
At the time of writing it looks as if Broken
Hill may not get much of a start during
1921. Judge Edmunds “settled the strike,”
and prior to the holidays the principal mines
were getting ready for production. Now
that metals have slumped there is some un-
certainty as to who can carry on-. The
following table of average metal prices, com-
pared with the price ruling at the end of
1920, will be of interest as showing the
altered conditions of the industry at Broken
Hill:—
10 Years End- Present
ing 1911. 1913. 1920. Price.
Lead (per
ton) £l4/2/5 £lB/6/2 £3B/1/4 £23/10/-
Zinc (per
ton) £22/17/9 £22/14/3 £44/17/10 £27
Silver
(standard
per oz.) 2s: 2d. 2s. 3d. ss. ljd. 3s. sd.
When the present prices of lead, zinc and sil-
ver are compared with the average prices for
1913, or with the averages for the 10 years
ending 1911, it is hard to realise that in-
creased wages and fuel costs more than
absorb the increase in metal prices. Increased
cost of all mining stores plays a part, but
labor inefficiency, designed and otherwise,
probably takes the highest toll. Even
allowing for that, there is apparently
some other factor which has rendered it
necessary for the Broken Hill cos. to at last
put on their thinking caps, and promise an
announcement early this month. Can it
be that there is a nigger in that sale of zinc
concentrates to the British Government for
10 years ! If the Broken Hill cos. announce
that under present prices they cannot carry
on it will be up to them to put the whole of
their cards on the table. With Broken
Hill shut down, the Cockle Creek works
were compelled to cease smelting customs
ores. Not that that mattered very much, be-
cause long before they closed down most of
the smaller producers had been driven out of
business.
In a silver-lead sense the one small bright
spark on the Australian horizon of 1920 has
been the Chillagoe (Queensland) State
Smelters. Under Minister for Mines Alf.
Jones, who has his heart and soul in the
work, the moribund Chillagoe mines and
smelters have been galvanised into activity.
The State took them over, and appointed
P. L. Goddard general rmmager. Barring
the period when coke supplies failed them,
the mines and smelters have been kept in
profitable operation. Cockle Creek being
closed down, Chillagoe silver-lead bullion is
being refined in London. The Queensland
Minister for Mines and P. L. Goddard de-
serve a special mention. They tolerate no
humbug from slackers, and have helped the
small man along to much good purpose.
Chillagoe _ to-day is a live concern, thanks
to a Minister for Mines who really knows
his business.
The principal copper-mines of the Com-
monwealth maintained operations during the
past year, although one or two of them had
to put up with temporary stoppages owing
to failure of _ coke supplies, mainly brought
about by shipping shortages. As in the
case of the silver-lead mines, the majority
of the smaller producers were long ago
driven out of business by the country’s war
metal-policy. The larger and more affluent
concerns were able to i((old on, but by the
end of the year even they were issuing warn-
ings or throwing out signals of distress.
The following comparison of average prices
is of interest:—
10 Years Present
Ending 1911. 1913. 1920. Price.
£67/6/8 £72/3/8 £llO/10/9 £B2/10/-
In most cases, the copper cos. derive some
benefit from the gold and silver contents of
the ore, so that apart from the higher
copper price there is something to be taken
into account also for the prevailing higher
price of both of the precious metals. The
gold price for the year will not fall much
below £6 per oz., and standard silver at
os. sd. is not to be despised. Apart from
labor inefficiency, the copper cos. have,
owing to high prices, probably become a
little slack in administration, and now that
bedrock has been reached most of them will
begin to remember that during the war Aus-
tralia’s copper was sold by the Government
far below world’s parity. Perhaps in the
interests of patriotism we could afford it,
but it would be nice now to have the extra
cash. The pity is that it was probably an
American or a Russian who got it. The pro-
duction of copper for the year will be found
to approximate 25,000 tones, which if sold at
the average price of the year would realise
in London over 2f millions. It has all
been sold through the Copper Producers’
Association, and, judging by past experi-
ence, it is quite possible that the actual
average price realised will not be known
until towards the end of this year. That is
the unsatisfactory feature of the Copper
Producers’ Association. It could and should
be remedied.
The tin producers in the Commonwealth are
nowadays not in the ascendant. Most of the
Australian mining brains and mining cash
that has any love for tin now turn towards
Malaya. It is easier, and labor conditions
are not so irksome. About 3000 tons tin will
cover our production for the year, which at
the average price of £295 gives a value of
£885.000. Tin prices compare as follows:
10 V ears Present
Ending, 1911. 1913. 1920. Price
£l4B/13/4 £2Ol/13/11 £295/5/6 £207/10/-
The present price is reported to be not
pleasing to most Malayan producers. They,
too, are experiencing rising costs.
Of the rarer industrial metals molybdenite,
wolfram and scheelite producers have not
had a good year. The war knocked these
metals entirely out of reasonable perspective.
With saner industrial conditions their time
will come again.
Summarised, the position of the base metal
industry in Australia to-day, despite the
SOS signals, is relatively not one whit
worse than it has been on many occasions
previously. Those responsible for the world’s
industries, however, are waiting for the tired
politicians to throw off their war weariness,
and allow the industrial affairs of the world
to get into industrial hands again. Between
the academic politician and the militant
Bolshevik the poor old world is having a bad
time. Neither understands industry, and both
are blocking the man who wants work done
from getting to the man who wants to do it.
This condition may last for a few months
yet, perhaps a year, but unless our civilisa-
tion is going to fail entirely, the work of
the world must be resumed this year. And
it must be work.

How Bendigo has gone down hill since the
war is shown by the following:—
Yield, oz. Calls. Dividends.
1915.. 118,783 £49,243 £62,587
1916.. 85,075 46,419 13,275
1917.. 68,425 56,779 6,451
1918.. 62,936 81,606
1919.. 64,970 63,258 1,822
1920.. 87,371 29,091 45,026
Over the six years £326,396 was extracted
from shareholders by way of calls, and only
£129,161 flowed back in divs. The 1916-19
peridd was one of heavy losses, and only
because of the unexpectedly high premium
on gold were investors able to get a bit of
their own back last year. During the past
five years the cash from gold won in the
merged Bendigo Amalgamated shows has
gone to prove that nearly all the mines had
duftered out. The position of that group
to-day makes it clear that the central block
consolidated by Teddy Dyason had its wealth
well raked by the old Lansell-Mueller-
Dyason crowd. Constellation’s riches have
faded away, but Carlisle looks healthier, and,
alongside, the spurs in the Unity may give a
shade of profits. The future of Bendigo
hangs on what is to happen at the Derby,
Alliance and Nelson shafts. Among the
old-time Bendigo producers that during the
year have gone to the pack are New Chum
Goldfields and North Bendigo. Golden
Fleece never ought to have been boomed, and
New Red, White and Blue has still to get
more gold in its acres of quartz before it can
pay. Another big ’un to hang in the dol-
drums is Central Blue, and the three Lansell
mines are patchy and poor. The reopening
of Ulster at 1000 ft. means desirable prospect-
ing, and though the first crushing was low
there is plenty of scope for development on
the eastern run of stone. The part the
Amalgamated fills at Bendigo can be gauged
by the fact that it raised 100,505 tons out of
the total of 128,840 tons sent to the mills by
some 20 cos. operating on the field. No
wonder with such a record Dyason is divert-
ing Bendigo’s attention to rubber-manufac-
turing.
Westralia is alarmed at the decay of gold
mining. Several one-time big mines have
passed away during recent years, and with
wages aeroplaning and cost of all kinds of
stores soaring most of the remaining large
producers are on the brink of the grave.
Extensive prospecting and co-operative effort
‘among producers are suggested as the best
means for reviving gold mining. There are
still a number of places worth trying, and
if new mines are discovered it is suggested
that money be found in the State to work
them. Hitherto Westralian mining capital
has been mostly obtained in other States
or in London, and much of it has been spent
in an illegitimate, and sometimes dishonest,
manner. In the case of the Hampton and
Mt. Monger boom the largest part of the
cash put up in many instances went to the
vendors and promoters of worthless ven-
tures.
Talbragar Valley Petroleum Prospecting
Co., in 1200 shares of £5 each, is the latest
entrant in the oil-hunt. Dunedoo, not far
from the old Gulgong goldfield, is to be the
scene of operations, and D. Sharkey, “who
has had wonderful results i$ water divining,”
is the man who is going to produce oil from
a square-mile which it is proposed the co.
should take over. Everything is cut-and-
dried. Sharkey, super-diviner, has, by means
of his "improved patent divining apparatus,”
already mapped out the strata down to
(>27ft. at the proposed bore site, and divined
three petroleum occurrences, the “indications”
being that they consist of pools 50ft. to over
100 ft. in diameter. On such bunkum is Tal-
bragar Valley being floated, though the pro-
spectus—which emanates from the Marshalls’
office (A. Marshall is a director) —wisely
refrains from any statement beyond the
admission of the co.’s dependence on Sharkey
•to put it on to oil. The promoters are
alleged to have “infinite faith” in the diviner.
They demonstrate that faith by asking the
public to subscribe for 400 contribs., while
vendors and promoters take the same number
of fully-paids themselves.

James Dooley, who will wear the mantle
of Premier Storey whilst that statesman is
abroad, has sat in the N. S. Wales Assembly
since 1906, and arrived from Dublin six
years before that. He is about the most
logical debater the N. S. Wales Labor party
has, and has an inexhaustible appetite for
facts. He is not likely to break anything
whilst John Storey is away.
Captain B. E. Bardwell was the ex-A.LF.-
officer who took command of the Broome
(W.A.) Diggers when Nippon was hitting
things up. Since the century began he has
had seven years of war—he was a lieutenant
in one of the Westralian contingents that
fought in Boerland—and when the trouble
started near home he simply had to be in it.
In the briefxleisure that an adventurous life
has left him. t Bardwell has written Bul-
letin verse.
Charlie Evans, of Queensland, went out
with the old year. He was Commissioner
of the State railways from 1911 to 1918
and made them pay handsomely, which is
more than Theodore and Fihell.y have done.
In his youth, like his father before him,
Evans worked for the G.W.R. Co. in Eng-
land, but came to Queensland in 1867, and
was a guard on the Ipswich-Toowoomba
line for years. Then he caught Thallon’s
discerning eye, and thenceforward rose
steadily. He had a warm heart but a
rough tongue. Nothing pleased him better
than to tell interfering politicians what he
thought of them.
At 84 years of age, C'uthbert Allison, well
known throughout the Riverina, crossed the
Big Divide at Claremont (W7A.) on Dec.
17. Allison was the last of the first genera-
tion of Victorian legal managers; he held
the job for the Ostell and Weidall Co., Bal-
larat, in 1861. Subsequently- he was town
clerk and engineer at Hay, Wilcannia and
Broken Hill, at the two former installing
the existing water supplies. One of his
hobbies was street tree-planting, and his
best monuments are green avenues in the
dry towns he was officially connected with.
As a pastime he cultivated a passion for
logarithms, and was a bigoted believer in
hard work.
N. S. Wales Boilermakers’ Union has been
a prolific breeder of politicians. Out of it
came Allan McDougall, the State’s first
Labor senator ; ex-Premier McGowen ; present
Premier John Storey; the late Bob Howe,
M.H.R. ; Mahoney, member for Dailey; and
others of less note. W. J. Mclvell, Minister
for Justice, is also an offshoot of the union.
Still only a youngster, he got a job in the
union office and began reading for the Bar.
The bright young man dropped into politics
at the first time of asking, and having shaped
promisingly as Assistant Minister in charge
of the Justice Department he received a full
portfolio at an increased salary as a Christ-
mas box. And the gift included two months’
back pay.
Edward Lucas brings a minor knighthood
back from the S. Aus. Agent-General’s office.
He is the only one of a dozen or so young
North of Ireland men who emigrated to S.
Australia in a bunch 35 years ago to acquire
a handle; but all, or almost all, of them
acquired wealth. They had been in linen
and softgoods at home, and got jobs behind
the counter in Adelaide. Practically all of
them were soon in business for themselves.
Charles Moore and the others stuck to
money-making; Edward Lucas pulled out
and went into politics, leaving a brother to
represent the family in the old trade.
W. J. George, Westralia’s peppery Works
Minister, got a knighthood at the New Year.
English-born and an ironmaster by trade, he
entered the Western Assembly in 1897 and
has been there or thereabouts ever since. The
Leake Government made him Commissioner
of Railways, principally to get rid of an
embarrassing critic. When his five years
were up the Moore Government did not
renew the appointment, and within a year he
was back in the House «s member for Mur-
ray, his old constituency. He has since stuck
to it like glue. George is an industrious
Minister, but so choleric that he rarely gets
through a session without adding three new
enemies to his list. A fine son sleeps on Gal-
lipoli.
Henry Mildred, Adelaide lawyer, dead at
81, was probably the senior surviving native
of S. Australia. His career is a matter of
ancient history and half-forgotten names.
He was one of the first boys at St. Peter’s,
when that school was located behind Trinity
Church, in the city. First Richman and
Wigley, and then Belt and Cullen, were his
sponsors in the law, and he was admitted to
the Bar 58 years ago. He was a member
of -the S.A. Assembly in the ’seventies, his
father being in the Leg. Council at the same
time. One of his stories was of the
Da Costa bequest. Da Costa was a very
wealthy Adelaidean, who retired to England
60 years back. His local attorney was one
Hance, an official also of the Insolvency
Court, who claimed on retirement from the
Court that he had been promised a pension,
but did not get it. So. when Da Costa
wrote that he thought of bequeathing all his
S.A. property to the Government, Hance per-
suaded him to give it all to St. Peter’s
instead. That bit of revenge has made the
school unusually wealthy.
George Hunter, one of the latest Maori-
land knights, is a prim little man who will
not be 60 any more, addicted to sheep farm-
ing, pup-breeding, politics and horse-racing.
His father was the first mayor of Wellington,
but George and brother Paul spent most of
their lives at Porongahau, in Hawkes Bay,
where the family had many acres arfd shore
multitudinous jumbuc-ks. At every general
election since the long ago Hunter was a
starter, and generally got beaten. But
occasionally he scraped in, and in the year of
Dick Seddon’s greatest win he and R. D. D.
McLean and Captain Russell were returned
from Hawkes Bay to hold up the flag of the
Right Thinking Party. He is amiable and
pompous, and can be relied on to carry his
decoration with great solemnity.
Walter Price, unanimo'usly chosen for new
president of the Returned Soldiers’ League
in South Aus., is a son of the former Labor
Premier of that State, but has not taken to
politics like his brother, M.H.A. for Port
Adelaide. He is manager of the Govern-
ment’s Cold Storage Works, and a prominent
sportsman. He played cricket for S.A.
just before the Avar, brought back from it the
M.C. and a wound, and has since been
prominent in all repat. and ILS.L. work.
In or out of office J. B. Patterson was
ahvays ready to oblige a constituent with a
letter of intro, or recommendation for his son
or daughter when a Government billet was
sought. (The Postal Department was then
under State control, too.) When he was
Minister of Railways in Victoria or P.M.G.,
it was a marvel to certain people how they
managed to get
passed over when
the letters they
were given by J.B.
were quite as com-
mendatory as those
held by the more
fortunate. Finally
it leaked out that
the billet-hunters
who scored; had
their notes written
on colored paper;
departments could
take as little notice
as they pleased of
letters written on
whitepaper. After
the passage of the
Public Seryice and
Railway Acts Pat-
terson had not so
much patronage,
but he still man-
aged to work in
some “temporaries”
by the judicious use
of the old formula.
PERCY GERALD
STEWART,
M.H.R. for the
Wimmera (Vic.).
Cooper, the Maoriland Judge who gets a
title as well as a pension to retire with,
started at 15 to learn to be a compositor.
Four years later he dropped the em quad and
took to the law, in which, partnered by J. J.
Devose, he pursued Costs with great in-
dustry and success. Cooper, always an
Eminently Respectable citizen, was a lead-
ing figure among Auckland Tories until one
night when Seddon, th#n firmly on top,
addressed the populace. Then, to the hor-
ror of the local defenders of law and order,
it was Cooper who rose to move a vote of
admiration. In a week or two Cooper was
a puisne judge, and being a sound, careful
lawyer he was, in civil jurisdiction, a very
good judge, too. But his savage sentence of
18 years’ penal servitude on the famous
Powelkq—who promptly vanished out of a
window —was a shocking example of what
a wowser in a wig will do when he sees red.
A “Lex”: The rumor about W. A. Holman
and the Federal (Arbitration) judgeship is
largely a matter, probably, of his fitness for
such a job. Like Hughes, he broke with
Labor in a good cause. But he didn't im-
mediately become a vitriolic assailant of his
old friends. With all his mistakes he has
never played the sectarian or any other dis-
reputable ticket; never lost his temper ; never
gone back on a friend. It was this last
quality which chiefly brought about his
downfall, and when the crash came he took
it like a sportsman. It found him, as it did
Barton, more or less broke, which in an oblique
fashion redounded to his credit. Holman is
an indifferent lawyer. But, then, legal pro-
fundity isn’t required in arbitration. He
has a wonderful gift for quickly assimilating
the essentials of a case, and he can work
hard when he is put to it. But is it neces-
sary, when all is said and done, to push
politicians who have gone out of favor
with the constituencies into these big billets?
What an Arbitration Judge Delprat would
make! Could a worse High Commissioner
be imagined than Andrew Fisher?
Rev. GEORGE
NORTH ASH.
M.A., the cleri-
cal guide , philo-
sopher and
friend of actors
and actresses in
Sydney.
Judge Bu-
chanan (S.A)
was farewelled
by Chief Justice
Murray for his
colleagues and
Josiah Symon
for the Bar
He has not been
long a Judge,
but entered the
Supreme Court
as Master nearly
30 years ago. He
intends to live with his sons, who are on the
land in Victoria. Piper having once again
kept out of the way, Angas Parsons steps
up. In the old days, Barwell, Attorney-
General at the moment, would have grabbed
the judgeship, but eleaner ideals prevail now.
Parsons served his articles with Kingston
and has been in partnership with Glynn ever
since. Till the appointment was announced,
he was considered a good thing for the vacant
Agent-Generalship.
George Jones, dead at Oamaru, was one of
Maoriland’s old politicians. He was elected
for Waitaki in 1880, but after two sessions
dropped out, on a re-arrangement of electoral
boundaries. In 1895 he was lifted into the
Upper House, and stayed there to the end.
In working hours he travelled the Inky Way,
and rare musical tastes made him conductor
of the Oamaru Garrison Band.
From one who was on the other side:—
If Angas Parsons accepts a seat on the S.A.
Supreme Court Bench he should fit the job. He
was closely scrutinised by the press gang when the
conference between newspaper proprietors and the
A.J.A. was held at the Grand in July. As Langdon
Bonython’s son-in-law and chief advocate for the
owners of the dailies, he did his utmost for his own
side, but he was good-tempered, suave, courteous
and gentlemanly, and left no feeling of soreness even
when he beat you.
Arguing the point with Premier Jimmy
Mitchell has become a habit with J. .j.
Kenneally, who is leading the big railway
strike in the West. He was an engine-
driver at Northam when Mitchell was
merely the local member, and he spoke elo-
quently for sundry Labor candidates who
tried to put Jimmy out. Then lie opposed
Mitchell himself, but had no better luck.
Now the old controversy has been resumed
in a wider field.
Lord Loughborough, who arrived in Syd-
ney on a three months’ visit last week, is
modelled, so fa 15- as size, physique and tailor-
ing- go, on his friend the Prince of Wales.
He did strenuous service on four fronts
during the war, but reaped no decorations,
as often happens in such cases. Owing to
his casual methods he was not persona grata,
with the Generals, and one unconventional
effort of his during the Senussi campaign
caused him to be recalled furiously to -Cairo
by wire. He didn’t object, as his wife was
there at the time: he blew in, cheerfully
exnlained his position to Sir John Maxwell,
and returned to the Front with banners fly-
ing. He is a good horseman and plays everv
game known to the Aryan race. The worst
bit of luck that ever lief ell him was when
his legal representative nleaded the Gaming
Act on his behalf six weeks ago while he
was in Mesopotamia. The King’s Bench
Judge who tried the suit remarked that the
debtor »was plainly making every effort to
pay, and undoubtedly would soon be in a
position to do it. Judgment for the defen-
dant. But such triumphs are in the nature
of Pyrrhic victories in the eyes of the sport-
ing World; and the young man would pro-
bably have preferred his trustees to pay up
even to seventy times seven.
A SONG OF ESSENTIALS AND CONVENIENCES.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A week of the glad New Year is gone ;
There are fifty-one more to follow,
Thousands of collars to still put on
And tanks of tea to swallow.
Buttons and buttons I must undo
And studs I still must lose
As the months and days go tramping through
The country owned by Hughes.
I shall stand and lie and walk and sit
In a regular dull routine;
I shall by turns be ill and fit
And cowardly, brave and mean.
I shall have vision to lose my way
And blindness enough to find it,
And sugar and trousers and bills to pay
And a cheque when my luck has signed it.
There shall be cabbage and pale pink beef
And carrots and soap and sago
And faith and honor and unbelief
And passion-fruit bought from the Dago;
And the night shall fall and the dawn begin,
And Jones shall be still explaining
The reason the horses he backs don’t win
Or the fact that it isn’t raining.
There shall be cakes with icing on top
And beer that is short of foam,
And trains that run and trains that stop
And trains that may take me home.
The ink shall spill from the fountain-pen ;
And the wind like a goat shall caper;
And boys and girls and women and men
Shall live by the printed paper.
These things I know. Let the onions grow
Skin over skin to the middle.
I have taken my stand for this young free land
To sing to a gay tin fiddle.
But I want to say in a violent way,
Though with something of perturbation,
I might blush like Hughes, but I’d not refuse
A national presentation.

The Style for 1921.
A distinct departure from the flat-set brim charac-
terises incoming hat styles for 1921.
In these new models a decided curl of the brim all
round emphasises the popular acceptance of a style
altogether different from those in fashion during
recent years.
The hat quoted is of British make, very fine quality,
pure fur felt, brim 2g inches wide with bound edge.
Colors: Light Steel, Fawn and Sage.

On the everlasting paradox :
The labors of the late Basic Wage Commission—
on the whole a desperately matter-of-fact body—
weren’t all of the dry-as-dust order. In support of
their claim for a minimum of £ll ss. 6d. a week
for a family of five, the federated unions submitted
voluminous documentary evidence, included in which
were intimate details of what it costs to clothe the
female form divine, and one can imagine the inter-
“PLEASE EXPLAIN.”
“Married her for her figure!”
“Financial or physical?”
esting domestic discussions that raged on this subject
when the Commissioners got home after their day’s
work. Apparently dress schedules were prepared in
the first place by a committee of matrons in each
capital, and then vigorously sub-edited, so as to
secure uniformity, by some rude male hand. But
drastically as the blue-pencil must have been applied
strong individual and local preferehces remain. Thus,
while the Perth unionist’s wife demands a dress
allowance of £65 9s. 6id. a year the Brisbane dame
is satisfied with one of £57 7s. Id. Perth insists
that she can’t do without a winter costume at
£l2 125., a summer costume (of Assam silk) at
£9 95., a voile dress, six blouses and two skirts.
The Swanside lady is also more expensively gloved
and booted than her sisters in the other capitals,
and her golfer and dressing-gown are the most elabo-
rate on the list. Brisbane has a weakness for hats,
Sydney for furs and blouses, Melbourne for top coats,
corsets and nightdresses, Adelaide for underskirts
(and culture) and Hobart for summer dresses. All
the ladies require six pairs of stockings per annum,
\>ut whereas the others are content with cashmere,
Brisbane coyly asks for two pairs of silk. She is
a sub-tropical charmer and must have her dash of
coquetry. And they all put in for bathing-gowns
except Melbourne. Melbourne hasn’t wholly sur-
rendered to the lure of surfing and doesn’t yet con-
sider the bathing-gown indispensable. So long as?
Melbourne has a seven-guinea top-coat she can get
along without a bathing-gown. How subtly charac-
teristic of Melbourne!
* * * *
“Sepoma”: Only one white woman within
my knowledge has gone back on her
color in a tropical country, and
that occurred a year or so
before the war in Rabaul,
where a white Australian girl
suddenly forsook the German
family with which she had
been living as governess and
lady’s maid and “went bush”
with an ex-member of the native
police. Previously she had
been warned by her employer
about her familiarity with her
dark friend, but, in spite of the
fact she was fully aware that
her offence would be considered
ten times more serious than if
it had taken place in a white
man’s country, she persisted and
finally cleared out with the
object of her affections, the
couple making for the Baining
district, of which the nig. was
a native. To give the Germans
their due credit, they promptly
recovered her and shipped her
back to her family at their
own (the Germans’) expense,
while the native Lothario was
awarded a sentence of five
years’ hard under the elastic
German law. I remember the
Hun doctor in Rabaul at the
time advancing a theory that
the girl was responding to some
primitive impulse. There might
he something in the theory as
far as that particular case was
concerned, but more generally,
in parallel cases which have
occurred in cities, where the
male lover has been Chinese, the actuating
motive has been a desire for free and easy
Tucker and plenty of cheap clothes.
“Six and Eight”: Mention by “Torts”
(B. 16/12/’2O) of the Sunday Observance
Act recalls when Kewtun, seen planting
dinglefoozles on Sunday by an unfriendly
sergeant, was cited before the late N. S.
Wales police-magistrate Badham, then dis-
pensing much law and little justice in a
country district. The invitation to court
was to the effect that Kewtun did on God’s
holy Sabbath day dig, harrow, hoe, plough
and otherwise cultivate a certain piece or
parcel of land, to wit, a flower and vegetable
garden, to the exceeding great annoyance of
the liege subjects of our Sovereign Lord the
King and the scandal of the passers-by.
When fined the foxy defendant elected to
take it out, because he knew that in default
of payment the archaic statute only provided
for detention in the stocks, and that there
were no stocks. Badham, however, not
relishing that the long ears of the law should
become objects of ribald jest, ordered stocks
to be made. The township was anticipating
a hilarious time pasting a Chow with ancient
eggs and rotten cabbages. It was an inter-
fering pressman who spoilt the fun : he made
a mild scoop by wiring the news to Sydney
papers. Its appearance jolted the Crown
Law Department into a splutter of activity.
Urgent wires knocked on the head the
stocks-construction industry, and the bottom
fell out of the township’s market for rotten
eggs and corrupt cabbages.
“Whitehall” on changed times: —
“If blood be the price of Amiralty, Lord God we
ha’ paid in full!” So sang Kipling; and if for
the word “blood” the phrase “a total sacrifice of
all beastly pride” were substituted, one would get
the ideal motto for a modern Governor. When Lord
Dudley first arrived in Sydney the papers disclosed
that he had met a vet. in Macquarie-street who had
served with him in the Boer War. The G.-G. walked
with the animal-doctor the entire length of the
street! A number of old gentlemen who are now
Nationalists shook their heads and said such an
action was Socialism pure and simple. When at a
Club dinner some weeks later Dudley declared him-
self of an Australian Navy the first disas-
trous impression was confirmed. “A dam’ demmy-
gog! ” cried a prominent member of the since-
deceased Empire League. On Christmas Day Governor
Davidson pushed his way into a group which was
shifting coal on the railway near Sutton Forest.
“Shake hands!” he said, though he didn’t know any
of them personally. According to an evening paper,
“some of the dirtiest were abashed and held up
their hands to show they were unfit to be touched.”
However, “Shake all the same, boys,” insisted the
genial Excellency. “ ‘Christmas comes but once a
year,’ you know.” “ That’s the spirit,” said the Clubs,
sententiously ; “placate the working classes.” During
the Carrington regime someone at Government House
made the appalling social error of sending an invi-
tation-card to a home-grown artist. More astonish-
ing still, the wretched fellow turned up. As Car-
rington sat on the dais in the ballroom subduing a
good-looking woman, the artist lurked beneath the
musicians’ gallery and committed furtive sacrilege.
Yes, he made a rough sketch of the great man’s
profile! He was hustled out of the place somehow,
and for years his action was quoted as an instance
of the depths to which such creatures will descend.
On Boxing Day the Governor-General and his wife
posed in their race-clothes for a press photographer
like a couple of musical-comedy stars. “Good stuff!”
cried the descendants of the people who had damned
the artist who profaned Carrington. “Very good
stuff indeed in its way! But it’s a pity they didn’t
SOMETHING IN-STORE.
"Why, don't, you think they are happily
matched?”
“Oh — er — wcll, you see, he doesn’t know his
own mind.”
“Pooh, that’s nothing! He’ll soon know
hers.”
dress a bit more plainly and get snapped making a
bet on the Outer.”
“Tun’ler”: “8.C,” (B. 18/11/’2O) cites
an uncommon routine order, but the enclosed
U.S. order beats it easily. Can anyone
imagine any of our G.O.C.’s pointing his
moral in topical verse? —
In case of gas attack, remember three things:—
1. Hold your breath.
2. Get on your mask QUICK.
3. Warn your pals. Don’t take chances.
If you do you’ll never get another.
They’re only two kinds of men in a gas attack —
the Quick and the Dead.
To which division would you belong? DON’T
BE DEAD.
The hard-boiled guy said gas was bunk,
It couldn’t hurt you; only stunk.
They sent young guy up to the line.
Fritz spilled the mustard good and fine.
And yet they’re some can’t tell you why
’Twas flowers for the hard-boiled guy.
“Gregor”: A certain order of citizen,
normal in other respects, has a strange
yearning to become a hangman. The finan-.
cial lure can’t be the attraction, for the fee
is rarely more than £lO per scragging, and
opportunities of earning it are few and far
between. Yet there is not a sheriff’s office.
in Australia which hasn't
many applications on hand,
and frequently it is urged
that the writer has special
qualifications for the art of
stretching a fellow-creature’s
neck. Incidentally, n o
State now maintains a sti-
pendiary Ketch. Even Vic-
toria, which had one on its
pay-sheet for years, has
lately sacked him and re-
verted to the system of
engagement and payment
per hanging. In fact, with
capital punishment abolished
in two States and rarely
practised in the rest, the outlook for the
hanging profession is poor indeed, which
makes the morbid rush to be. incorporated
in it all the more difficult of comprehension.

“Gregor”: Mention fB. 23/12/’2O) of the
Federal Government’s belief that at last it
has succeeded in tracking down the ship-
ment of gold coin which went astray from
Rabaul at the time of that town’s occupa-
tion in 1914, recalls an interesting item of
unwritten history. None of our people knew
what the money was doing at Ilabaul, who
owned it, where it came from, or how much
of it there was, estimates ranging from
10,000 to 20,000 pounds. But the fact upon
which all are agreed, both German and
British civilian residents, is that it was
there, and that Von Haber, the German Gov-
ernor, had it removed for safety to Nama-
nula, on the outskirts of Rabaul, no later than
the day before that on which the Australians
landed at Ilerbertshohe. Thence onwards
the bullion is wreathed in mystery. Some of
the Germans allege that a detachment of the
invaders found it, and, saying nothing about
their good luck, removed it to another hiding-
place until they returned to Sydney, when
they took it with them. Other Huns allege
that it was two German officials who, having
accidentally learned where Von Haber had
secreted the gold, got away with it them-
selves and have been living in luxury on
sauer-kraut and weinenvurst ever since.
Others, again, are sure that a Japanese mer-
chant, who in pre-war days was a kind of
unofficial agent of the German Governor,
knows more than anybody else about the
matter. Throughout the military occupa-
tion the Administration clung to the idea that
the coin had been planted somewhere in
Babaul or close by, and that it was still
there; and probably it will come as a sur-
prise to the garrison troops who took part,
early in 1916, in the great cleaning-up of
the town, the alleged object of which was
to destroy malarial-mosquito breeding-places,
to learn that this was in reality one of the
staff’s numerous attempts to find the missing
cash. Four or five different expeditions
have left Rabaul since 1914 to look for the
money, but not one has succeeded in finding
a trace of it.

his swim the abbreviated Talleyrand returned
to the station, explained the situation and

“Hamer”: The story was told in the even
tones of a woman who saw nothing humorous
in her presentation of drab facts. “He.was a
rich man,” she said, “and, although he had
a violent temper, lie meant well. He’d give
his wife a smack in the face or a black eye

For holidays down to the sea,
To Stay with his wife’s sister,
McTavish took the missus, lie
In six years had not kissed her;
For Helen was no braw wee lass,
No brave dame sniggered fra her glass.
But one week sin’ Mac paid to Skewes
Fifteen and saxpence for her shoes.
When walking on the pier one day
The guid McTavish madam
Slipped on an orange-skin that lay
Upon the hard macadam.
She plunged into the deep green sea.
A young man saw, and quickly he
• Threw off his things and hailed a boat,
Dived in and kept the dame afloat.
The two were hauled ashore, and Mac
Embraced the hero willing.
Said he: “Guid grit ye dinna lack —
Here’s for yersel’ twa shilling.*’
The crowd expressed derisive mirth.
“The clothes,’’ said Mac, “are naethin’ worth;
The hat’s spoiled; but Awm ’bleeged to you
For the twa boots —the boots are new!”

“Banzai”: Have we really an Intelligence
Corps in Australia, or have they all gone
to sleep? Every schoolboy knows —though
Pearce mayn’t—that Queenscliff and Sor-
rento are strategical points which command
the entrance to Port Phillip Bay. Quite
recently a party of intelligent-looking Jap-
anese has been industriously taking photo-
graphs in these localities. Now and then
similar reports drift over from the Hender-
son Base in Westralia, but nobody worries.
In the matter of naval defence Australia
has gone to sleep.
* * * *
“The Wanderer”: Yes, the bush makes
them tough. 'On the Manning (N.S.W.),
not long since, a chap .who had been doing
clearing work in rough country was found
lying on the ground, apparently dead, with
a note close by stating that he had taken
cyanide. His mate, after examining him,
was satisfied, that he was as defunct as
Julius Caesar’s grandfather, and rode off to
Cooplacurripa to tell a policeman. The
constable having acquired all the facts, the
coroner at Taree was informed, and the local
undertaker was instructed to see to the
coffin. Meantime the policeman, with the
dead man’s mate and several others who
had heard the news, made tracks to the
camp where the body was waiting. On
arrival it was noticed that the dead man
had moved: he was lying on a bunk, and,
though now he had a gallery rifle bullet in
his forehead, he' wasn’t nearly as dead as
he had been previously. In due course the
corpse was brought to Wingham, and
ordered to the hospital for treatment. On
the way the coroner was met going out
to conduct the inquest. The coffin was
well in hand. But up fo the present neither
inquest nor coffin has been required. The
chap has gone forth again, and crossed the
Manning instead of the Jordan.
THE SAVING GRACE .
“There's one good thing about Billy's new
song."
“Really? I didn't think it had a redeeming
feature."
“Oh, rather. Nobody will sing it."
From the branch of a country willow: —
A thin voice reached my tree the other day and it
belonged to a local manufacturer. Ilis complaint
was that he couldn’t place his goods with the
storekepeers of his town, but had to ..send them to
one of the big distributing houses in the city. In
turn the local storekeepers got this man’s goods
railed back to them plus the agent’s fee and the
cost of the double rail journey. And the storekeepers say
to the consumer: “Patronise local industry. Be a
decentraliser and shop in your home town.” And
the consumer answers: “If the price is right you’ve
no need to worry.” And so the thing goes on
with the price right nowhere, and always the agent’s
fee and the cost of the double rail journey looming
in the background.
Then there was a man who came to my tree
with a trowel in his hand. The h.c.l. was his
trouble —he had just bought a pair of locally-
manufactured boots. T said: “How many bricks
did you lay in the last hour and a half you were
at work ? ” He said: “Twelve.” Mv fellow-lodger
on the willow-branch laughed.
THE FORETHINKER.
“If I don't soon go for a long holiday from
business I’ll have a serious illness —I
know I shall!”
“Better let me have one first, dear — I’ll be
able to bear the worry better then.”
Another man came along smelling of sheep. I
said: “What is your trouble?” He said: “That’s all
past. I buy .and seli sheep now. But I was an
orchardist and I employed four men all the year
round. Two years running the drought killed my
crops, and the third year a hailstorm knocked every
piece of fruit off my trees. I had a good crop the
next year, but the pickers wanted such wages that
I couldn’t pay them. I sold a few castes in the
town at 4s. a case, after I’d grown them and
picked them myself and hadn’t got a penny off
the trees for three years. As the carter was taking
the cases, into the Dago’s a man said to the Dago:
*How much?’ He said: ‘Twelve shillings a case.’
I haven’t got a fruit-tree now and I run sheep.”
The sheepman hadn’t been gone long when I 1 was
nearly suffocated by the smoke from a heap of
brambles. I called out to the swagman and he
came up close. I said: “What are you ?” and he
answered “I’m a motor-mechanic.” I said: “There
is a man in the town who will give you a job
at £6 per week.” He said: “I want £7.” I
said: “Are you earning £7 now?” and he said
“No, I’m not earning anything.”
Then the sun rose, and fny fellow-lodger on the
willow-branch was laughing again.
“Fax” : The headmaster of Trinity Gram-
mar School, Kew (Vic.), has revived the
question of moving-picture morals in his
annual report. He nothing extenuates nor
sets down aught in malice. “Pictures might
be used as a great educatiohal agency to
teach high ideals,” he says. “Cannot we do
something to preserve the chivalric ideal of
a boy £pr womankind? I defy the boy who
is a habitue of the pictures to retain
his faith in the purity of woman; and as to
the baseness to which men may stoop, he has
temptation put into his mind of the most
alluring suggestiveness. Someone must act
if our young people are to be saved, and it
must be constructive action—the screening of
the right pictures, not the prohibition of any.”
All true enough. The suburban picture-show
is quite capable of doing a boy more harm in
a month than the schoolmaster can do him
good in a year. Anyone who professes to
indignantly deny that there is moral poison
in many of the pictures is probably a share-
holder in the local film palace, prepared to
sell his conscience for a mess of dividends.
But a point that the protesting schoolmaster
overlooks is the demoralisation of spoken
melodrama in sympathy with the silent tales
of sin and wickedness that flit their giddy
hour across the screen. New-laid snow was not
whiter than the purity of stage heroines when
Bland Holt, the kindly funny man, used to
rush to the rescue of virtue in distress; and
villains were doomed to an awful retribution.
“Lud”: Who engineered the movement in
Melbourne some months ago for giving poor
citizens a chance to get cheaper fruit from
street barrows? Until then there had been
here and there in the city a white Austra-
lian stall where one could buy fruit of
good quality at less than shop rates. At
one time the supply promised to increase,
but presently the bar-
row merchants began
t o complain that
market prices were
being raised against
them. Then came a
new a r r a*n g e m e nt
whereby new barrow
permits were granted
to new men for stands
outside the railway
stations at Flinders-
street and Princes’
Bridge; and somehow
this regulation, which
professed to be in the
public interest, was
fatal to the white
men who sold com-
paratively cheap fruit
and asparagus. They
disappeared from they*
old stands, whilst
Dagoes popped up
more than ever in
connection with the
stalls outside the rail-
way stations. These
swarthy aliens are
agents, seemingly, for
the Dago shops. Their
prices are the same
except when they offer
fruit too withered for
the shops to put in
their windows. The
public is worse off
than ever, and people
who avoid Dago, shops
on account of the dirt,
insole n c e and dis-
honesty of King
Tino’s subjects, are
being tricked into
dealing with the shops’ barrow-branches
under the pretence that struggling white
Australians are in charge.
“Benzol”: Another foreign curse that Aus-
tralia has imported is the drug-habit, and
the authorities are making spasmodic efforts
to deal with it. A recent regulation pro-
vides that no prescription for any narcotic
drug is to be repeated by a chemist without
an express order from the doctor. Whole-
sale houses are also forbidden to sell mor-
phine to dentists. These restrictions merely
favor the drug peddler, who js increasing in
number, and whose surreptitious “coke” and
morphine are probably smuggled goods from
Java. These ruffians represent a new
menace, for it is in their interest that there
should be as many addicts, and hence cus-
tomers, as possible.' In Victoria there are
five times as many known victims of nar-
cotism as there were a few years ago. The
State Institute at Lara, where the poor
devils are treated, is almost full this year,
whereas in the last year before the war it
treated only three patients for morphinism
and none at all for cocainism.
• “Malaprop”: George Birmingham, who
writes books about Ireland, says that things
have changed while people weren’t looking. At
one time the priests directed things and the
politiciaffs did as they told them. Now, he
says, the Church doesn’t shove but is shoved,
though it may not be aware of it. There
certainly are wisps of evidence to support
this view. One Irish bishop lately de-
nounced the ambush variety of warfare and
threatened excommunication. When this
pronouncement was read in the churches
“numbers of young men,” a cable said,
“walked noisily out.” That may mean some-
thing or it may not. For many years,
down to the time of the old and the middle-
aged, the Irish clergy fought the battles of
the people against the big absentee landlords
and the parish priest was the buffer between
the impoverished tenantry and the rack-
renting agent. Now, with almost total
abolition of the landlord and the impending
disappearance of the last of the tribe, with
peasant ownership and with fixity of tenure
and greatly reduced rents for the tenants
who still remain, there is little for the priest
to be a buffer against save the ghostly terrors
of the next world. The question is whetheh
the-ghostly terrors are sufficient to maintain
his old influence. The Father’s influence
over the old flock may last longer here than
in his own country, for at this distance the
old Irish landlord who was the chief trouble
seems still alive. It is the people on the
spot who notice that he is dead.
“0.K.”,: Conan Doyle’s photographs, of the
vague apparitions he presents as visitors
from spirit world recall a story of the late
Nicholas Caire, an enthusiast in landscape
photography, whose ■ pictures of Gippsland’s
ancient gums are now historic evidence that
the monster trees onqe flourished. Caire was
engaged by a spiritualist to attend. some
seances-and take photos of the spooks who
visited the mystic circle. The honest old
photographer carried his camera into the
circle and went through the form of taking
•photographs according to instructions. He
saw nothing to photograph except gloom, but
he gravely did his best. The first two nega-
tives-he developed were blanks, but the third,
which he treated on a very hot day, yielded
d blister in the middle of the plate, just
where the spook .form was supposed to have
stood. Blisters in a negative, like clouds in
the sky or coals in the fire, will give grotesque
effects, and frill all round the edge—-like hair
aborrt a spook’s head. The ardent believer
who had been waiting breathlessly for results
jumped for joy when the third negative came
to light. “Now are you convinced?” he
shouted to the photographer. “There’s the
spirit form before your eyes.” Caire gravely
assured him he was looking at a blistered
film—a defective plate. But of course the
believer wouldn’t have the truth at any price.
The negative was faultless, the blister was
the spook, and Caire was an unconscious
medium who obstinately declined to admit the
evidence of his own photographic possibilities.
“Hamer”: Having regarded the advertise-
ments of the correspondence colleges, I per-
ceive some notable omissions. I intend to
open a college myself for tuition in neglected
subjects, and have already drafted this ad.:
Learn to be a Prime Minister. The science of
statesmanship taught in 21 lessons. Why not be a
Lloyd George or a W. M. Hughes? Instruction
given by correspondence by Mr. John Chucktout,
ex-M.L.A.
Can you put away 40 drinks a day and not show
it? The art of beer-sinking imparted by correspon-
dence. You pay for the beer, we drink it, and tell
you how it is done.
Do you wish to be a successful policeman ? Full
instructions given by correspondence in roll-collect-
ing, jury-compilation, filling-in census papers, how
to answer ridiculous questions, what to do with lost
babies- and the detection of .unregistered dogs. Lessons
in thief-catching, though not necessary for the
ordinary eair be arranged. “How to become
popular at headquarters” is a special course.
A school for a score of neglected subjects
''-should be a paying proposition. The supply
of mugs seems unlimited;
* * *
“Audio”: High military rank always fills
the unseasoned soldier with awe. In the
early stages the might and dignity of our
Brigadier-General raised him high above
other mortals in our estimation. Then one
day the brigade was lined up on the desert
at Heliopolis to hear results of a recent
Zeitoun examination. “Commanding offi-
cers fall out!” roared the Brigadier, and the
four rulers of our destiny stood to attention
humbly before him and got their orders. A
little • after they had gone back to their
positions I noticed a cloud Of sand approach-
ing rapidly. The General ndticed, too, and
digging spurs into his horse galloped across
to meet it. It was General Maxwell, G.0.G.,
Egypt, with ap aide-de-camp. Our G.O.C.
leapt from his charger, stiffened to atten-
tion and saluted. “What are you doing
with these men, Blank?” said the great man.
GOES WITHOUT SAYING.
“I hear May has jilted Billy and is going
to marry someone else. Who is the
happy man?”
“Billy.”
“Reading Zeitoun results, sir,” replied our
commander, meek as a mouse. “Well, you’d
better stand them at ease,” the other barked.
Then flicking his horse’s tail in the listener’s
face he galloped off in a cloud of dust. On
that day I made up my mind that the only
jobs in the Army really worth having are
those of King, padre and doctor.

OLD LADY (unaccustomed to tram travel-
ling): “Er—which end do I get out?"
CONDUCTOR : “Please yourself, mum, the car
stops at both ends."
“Mimosa”: Australians always were
possessed of initiative and resource. It did not need
a war to let us know that. In the old days,
especially out in the then Never-Never, proofs of it
could be got daily. For instance, a few of the very
old hands may recollect the celebrated Blaekwater
burial in Western Queensland. S- kept a pub
there of a kind, and from the day that he took over
until he passed out it was one continuous jamboree.
As expected, he threw the seven among- his old cob-
bers. A few of them started to dig a grave, the
balance to make a coffin. The digging party returned
and reported' all ready. More drinks —all hands and
the Chow cook blind-o. A dray served as a hearse;
the friends staggered behind. Arriving at the grave-
side it was discovered that the coffin was about nine
inches too long for the hole. It was put to a vote
and the Ayes had it that the burial should stand over
until 9 o’clock next morning. Before leaving they stood
the coffin, and incidentally the corpse, end-up in the
grave. Morning found the friends of the departed
suffering shamefully. A hurried consultation was
held as to the best way of getting the coffin into the
grave that was dug too short. A decision was soon
arrived at. It was that the nine inches be sawn off
the bottom of the coffin. The operation was done with
a cross-cut saw. No parson was present. It was
described by some present as just a “plain” burial.
The friends returned t 8 deceased’s pubbery." One
appointed himself curator of the estate. The
administration lasted a fortnight. Then they all dis-
persed.
* * * *
“Rang”: “Mr. Mac.” (B. 2/12/’2O) is
talking through his hat when he says it is most
uncommon for dingoes to attack humans. When
cornered a full-grown dog will almost invariably turn
upon his pursuer, be it man or beast. Only last
month a police magistrate from Broken Hill was on
his way to Tiboobur'ra when he was told at a station of
such an incident that had occurred just prior to his
arrival. One of the station-hands had been tracking
a big dog for some hours and had eventually got it
bailed up in a corner of a paddock. The dog had
suddenly turned and rushed upon him, fangs bared.
The station-hand dropped his gun in the excitement
and took to a small tree, but his weight was too
mucht and the sapling kept bending towards the
ground. Every time the tree bent the dingo leapt,
which is why that station-hand was eating his dinner
off the mantel-piece. The timely arrival of the boss
had probably saved the man from something more
serious than a chewed posterior.
“Boomerang”: Two incidents in my ex-
perience re heart action after death. A large black
snake, sft. 4in. long, was vainly struggling to escape
over the wire-netting boundary fence, when a bullet
from my .22 Winchester' stopped it, its back safely
broken. This was about 7 a. in. At sunset the same
day I again passed the reptile and was amazed to
note a peculiar moving in the body. I investigated,
and found the heart still feebly attempting to beat.
Again, at Rockhampton, some fishermen had landed
a tiger-shark. They cut the heart out and left it on
the beach. The crabs duly ate all the softer parts
of it, so that the next morning all that remained
were the hard, muscular tissues ; but they were still
visibly palpitating. It was truly a weird sight.
“Skyrider”: Old Rangerfield, who lived
not far from Junee (N.S.W.), always swore that a
man never made a mistake by doing another a good
turn, and I saw his contention justified when the last
drought broke up. The country was as dry as flint
and Rangerfield’s dam was the only one in the dis-
trict with a drop of moisture left in it. The neighbors
for miles around had watered their stock at it for-
weeks ; his own beasts always got their fill, and con-
sequently, on the last
Saturday of the worst
week, the dam had nearly
petered out. And then, as
luck would have it, just
at sunset along comes
Charlie Pearse, the drover,
with 20 .bullocks, only
survivors of a mob he was
taking into Junee. The old
farmer was out at the
sliprails when Pearse came
along. “Any water on
your place?” asked the
drover. “If I can’t get
them a drink to-night I’ll
lose them.” Rangerfield
thought a minute. “There’s
a bellyful apiece,” he re-
plied, “but if I let them
have it my cows will go
without in the morning.”
Pearse looked at his cattle,
shock up his weary old
prad, and was about to
move on. The old man
dropped the rails. “Come
on,” he said, “I’ll chance
it. It might rain before
morning.” (It looked as
much like rain as Can-
berra looks like a capi-
tal.) Half an hour later
Pearse’s bullocks were lying
down in the reserve across
the road, and Rangerfield’s
dam looked like a churned-up mud pie. But that
night heavy clouds rolled up in the west, it was
raining hard by midnight, and by dinner-time next
day the dam w y as full to the brim!
* * * *
“Fait Lux”: Someone was inquiring for
a white foal. Let me introduce Monkey, a white
mare, now at Cue (W.A.), who was foaled at Mt.
Magnet 20 years ago, and was white from birth.
Monkey has had a dozen foals—mostly bays. The
last one was a dark-bay, afterwards changing to
a blue roan, and now a beautiful pure-white two-
year-old.
“Poultry” : The following has just reached
me from a man who was once a very successful
poultry-farmer in Australia, and is now as suc-
cessful in S. Africa. He writes: “Last year, aid
now this, must go down in the annals of poultry-
farming as remarkable for the preponderance of
IN FACT, HE FELT HEMMED IN.
JACK' : “How did Bill like it over there?”
FRANK: “He did not care for the surroundings.”
JACK: “What was wrong with them?”
FRANK: “Well, for one thing, they were too high to climb, and all the doors were
locked.”
male birds. It is absolutely staggering, and there
seems to be no accounting for it. I find my cockerels
ha\e exceeded my pullets by 4 to I and even 5 to 1.
It has always been proved that after a big war
male-births among humans exceed those of' females,
but it is quite a new theory that poultry follow suit.
I correspond with most of the big breeders in this
country (S.A.), and every one of them has noticed
this extraordinary phenomenon. One big breeder,
who wrote me eight months ago, even then said he
noticed this extraordinary proportion of cock birds
to pullets and he called it a cock year, but can
give no why or wherefore. Now I notice that
gamekeepers in England have seen the same among
the pheasants.” Is any Abo. reader sufficiently
poultry-wise to suggest a reason? To me the whole
thing appears incredible and just one of those hap-
penings that result from pure cussedness.
“To Po”: Our public-house has a cellar
that requires periodical pumping by a machine made
chiefly of a long tin cylinder, a piston bound with
rag, and four transverse beams on which the pumpers
drag. Several generations of Bonifaces found
that the drunks who manipulated the contraption
never pulled together, and there were words, bad
words. But Mick, the new publican, has solved
the problem. When the boozers get to it, he, sit-
ting on a cask, sings “Pull for the Shore” with
measured beat and slow. As the business proceeds
the chant increases in tempo and volume, and the
team works with the precision and force of Ver-
brugghen’s orchestra. When the job is nearly
finished and beer-oh approaches, he slackens gradually
—diminuendo and all that sort of thing—and the
slaves of the galley cease with an expression on their
faces like that on a flea-infested poodle when his
back you scratch. Such is the power of music!
*/* * *
“Surtax”: I can endorse “Werrimee’s”
statement (B. 25/11/’2O) that Black Brother broke
out into cannibalism in settled districts quite re-
cently. I was on the Georgina in ’93 and ’94,
although only a newchum at the time—l had
but 20 years’ experience there then —and was a spec-
tator at a long-pig feast. The victim was a half-
caste piccaninny. For a few days there was a
feeling that something was on the cards. The old
gins gave some hints, so another man and I kept
watch. The nigs beat us at the killing, but we
saw the feast. The unfortunate kid was cut into
pieces and roasted at midnight. An old mammie
ran to our hut and called us —“Piccaninny tumble
down,” she whispered. We made for the camp,
but the meat was on the fire then and nothing
could be done, so we cut back to bed again.
Sciub-dashei . I was sharing a, caboose
with my grandfather away out in the hills of North
Queensland, and two hawks built a bedroom in a big
cadaga-tree just opposite the camp. We allowed
them to go on with their incubation until Mrs. Hawk
stole one of grandpa’s leghorns. Then the old Cale-
donian spoke violently, took down his gun and shot
the bird. What beat us then was that the business
was carried on just the same, and we presently
found that there were two of them on the job. Now,
did Mr. Hawk marry again? Or did he just take in
a housekeeper ?
* * * *
“Pick” : The bushland belief that a snake,
after biting one victim, requires time to produce a
fresh sac of venom before again proving nocuous,
goes astray when tested. A Gidleigli (N.S.W.)
station dogman, out on a rabbit raid with his regi-
ment, one day this early summer, met an outsize in
black crawlers. The latter didn’t furnish a chew
BOOR INDEED.
“Now, cheer up and leave me your address .”
“I ain't got no address.”
“What! No fav'rite pub?”
apiece for the avalanche of mongs that fell upon him
and in less than no time he was rent in pieces. But
as the procession moved on many of the nondescripts
strung out to the rear, and five of them handed in
their time this side of the boundary fence.

SINGING WATERS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Here, roused by singing waters
Wake the birds at break of day;
While the cascade leaps and gushes,
Wake the finches, wake the thrushes,
Wake the magpies, black and grey;
Then together, warbling, whistling,
Speed away.
Here, beside the singing waters,
No foot falls to break the spell
Cast by beauty; never lover,
Never loved one, musing over
Songs to sing and tales to tell.
Seeking elsewhere, find the graces
Here that dwell.
Wakeful men lind weary women,
Could they but this solace taste,
All as one and all together,
Careless all of wind and weather,
Hitherward they’d up and haste,
As tired pilgrims seek a fountain
In the waste.
They that sit at table drinking
Wine to soothe the hurt of care,
Did they in their deafness, blindness,
Know but of the gracious kindness
Of these waters, past compare,
Straightway would they up, and hither
Thirsting fare.
All day long the singing waters
Go their way through fern-trees tall,
With a gladsome, gliding motion,
Fearing not the distant ocean,
Hearing not its ancient call
Sent from bar and beach, where breakers
Foaming fall..
Winds beside the singing waters
Gossip of green wanderings—
• Verdant aisles and alleys lonely,
Known to birds and breezes only,
Lit by flowers and scarlet wings,
Where the sun his golden mantle
Daylong flings.
Here at home, by singing waters,
Throng the birds at end of day;
Here the finches, here the thrushes,
Here the reed-birds from the rushes,
Here the magpies, black and grey,
Fold their wings, grown tired of singing,
Tired' of play.

25 O’CONNELL STREET, SYDNEY
“Muiga”: I can’t credit “S.S.’s” story (B.
2/12/’2O) that the winner in a wood-chopping con-
test had a bucket of boiling-water nearby in which
he now and again dipped the axe. Any experienced
axemen knows that the two things that gap an axe
are hardness of the timber and the steel becoming
hot. In a chopping contest when the axes are
ground and sharpened like a razor no accessories are
required to free them from the log. Moreover, to
dip the Douglas into boiling water would mean
tha ruination 10 seconds afterwards of any sort of
blade I’ve ever swung.
* * * *
“Yacko”: I can quote a station where a
jumbuck serviced 280 hoggets in one night. Record?
* * * *
“45” : Can any Abo. wise man tell a new-
chum at the game the most economical and effective
way of building a dam across a creek 15ft. wide,
occasionally a chain of waterholes and occasionally
in flood? Plenty of bush timber, clay and a limited
quantity of large stones are available; also con-
venience for bywash.
“H6ugi”: Where did the Maoris get their
Latinity? Polack tells us that in his day the Maori
word for a dog was pero, which is all but the
Spanish perro. They called a pig parka, and accord-
ing to Macmillan Brown this variation of the Latin
porous was a genuine Polynesian word and not a
variation of the English “pork.”
* * * *
“Karee”: I heard a couple of wagtails
counting something out in the gtrava-tree, and find-
ing it was a frilled lizard crawling up to three baby
willies I gave him a Cadorna.. The pugnacious
couple nose-dived at
him until satisfied he’d
gone west; then they
ungratefully went for
my bald head, using
frightful language the
while. Finding they
could not shoo me off
the premises, one of
them dropped on the
ground and, trailing a
wing, dragged herself
painfully, as if badly
injured, to draw me
away. I took the hint
and buzzed.
AFTER THE EXPLOSION.
THE MECHANIC: “Damn these gas-plants!
Why, I might have been killed!"
“5086”: Any Abo. give a Digger who is
batching a hint about corning mutton? Being put
of range of the butcher’s cart I have to kill a sheep,
half of which I keep, or try to keep. We do well
for about three days; then the dogs come' to the
rescue. I have tried to corn, but up to date have
had no luck.
FELLOW-TRAVELLERS.
JUDGE: “ Have you anything to say, prisoner, before sentence is passed on you?"
PRISONER: “No, y'r Honor, except that the gentlemen of the press might kindly note in
their social columns that me and their Honors the Judges will shortly leave for
the country on our Long Vacation."
“Wee Bobbie” : The skipper of an Island
schooner, while waiting for the s.s. Melusia at
Gizo (Solomon Islands), went out shooting fish.
With two plugs he killed 2000 booma —-a
fish of the mackerel species. Dynamite was used ;
it kills more than gelignite. The whaleboat, fish
laden, made the round of all the waiting schooners
in the bay—in all about 15 —and threw a bucket-
full of fish aboard each. There was an average of
14 fish to a boy, but they had all disappeared before
morning.
* * * *
“Gayndah”: Anent “Sir Spen’s” par V (B.
25/11/’2O) and the cattle-throwing championship at
Moree carnival (N.S.W.) Munro’s time of 36sec.
should never have been accepted by the committee,
since he broke the beast’s leg. But after accepting his
time they had a right to award him the champion-
ship on the printed conditions. Bob Lawton’s time
was, on averages, only ljsec. divided by three worse
than that of the winning abo. But cattle, or, rather,
poddies, starved for three days, are poor stuff to
judge such a contest on, and throwing by the tail
was the only method resorted to.
* * * *
“Jimsey”: I know a spring near Sackville
Reach, Hawkesbury River, which commences flow-
ing just after sundown and ceases shortly before
sunrise, the pressure being highest about 3 a.m.
The water runs along the floor of a “gibbah” into
a hole outside, and this hole always contains about
30 gallons of clear, cold water, which seems to be
about the nightly outflow. I have visited this
spring many times in the last 15 years, and have
never know it to flow during the day.
* * * *
“Alex.”: The other day I saw a. sparrow
use his head. He was hopping about, apparently in
search of water, when he spied a tap with moisture
underneath. He perched on a stone, close to the
tap, and waited. Presently a globule of water
gathered and was on the point of falling. Flying
swiftly to the mouth of the tap he seized the
drop. This action he repeated about a dozen
times, and then flew off, his thirst assuaged.
* * * *
“Pick” : Abo. writers recently discussed
the theory that animal crosses result in a throw-
back to the inferior breeds. Well, Dan Soutliam, a
Coui'ia Creek orchardist (N.S.W.), has found' a
similar tendency in fruit-trees. He reared seed-
lings' from the pips of a superior sample of orange,
but when matured the narks bore lemons. Their
misbehavior was referred to John Halsted, N.S.W.
agricultural expert, who opined that the original
tree from which the seed had been gathered had
been an orange twig grafted upon a lemon stem.
„ “6T6”: Does any Abo. vet. know why ticks
fasten on to one particular horse in a mob —gener-
ally the poorest-conditioned one? Down the Borro-
loola (N.T.) road recently out of about 60 head of
horses one only had ticks. But that one had them
in hundreds.
“Mimosa” : Ever notice the great interest
and gentle affection that geldings show for young
foals ? Perhaps it is for the same reason that a
capon will rear - chickens. The best “mothers” I
have ever seen were cock ostriches which had been
caponised. The operation is done for the purpose
of improving the quality of the wing feathers, which
improve in lustre and “touch.”
* * * *
“Acid Drop”: “Wellington’s” tale of the
Maori and the stolen sheep on his back (B. 9/12/’2O)
reminds me of the trucker underground in the
Broken Hill Prop. Smoking was Strictly forbidden,
and when Boyd, the underground manager, encoun-
tered the chap on one of the drives with a lighted
fag in his mouth, he took him to task for smoking.
“ 'Oo’s smokin’ ?” said the trucker. “You are,”
said Boyd; you’ve a cigarette in your mouth now.”
“Well,” said the trucker, as he slowly abstracted the
fag, “1 wonder what put that there! ”
* * * *
“Steve”: I place the butcher-bird as the
best lightweight of the bush, as well as one of the
sweetest songsters. Two of them have a very jerry-
built house, consisting of a few sticks thrown any-
how into the fork of an Australian elm, near me. In
it they are raising three
butcher-boys; find woe to
anything that goes near them !
Dad was busy pilfering and
planting some steak I had
hanging, when he suddenly
woke up to the fact that a
big gohanna was climbing up
to his home to collect the
rent. Dad gave that discor-
dant laugh of his, and with
two straight darts put his bill
into the go.’s eyes. With
splendid wing work he then
quite mesmerised the go. Mum,
who had been fluttering over
the nest, now took a hand,
and drove a couple of vicious
stabs into the go.’s off eye,
while Dad in a clinch seized
the flickering tongue of the
rent collector and held on
grimly. The towel went in
as the go. dropped to the
ground heavily. Dad took no more notice of him,
but busied himself hunting off the spectators, and
then started on my steak again.
“Stronach”: I’ve only made his acquaint-
ance since coming to North-East Gippsland. He re-
joices locally in the name of salamander. A rather
neat dresser, his seasonal suits range from light grey
to dark green. His home is on the river-banks, and
he’s a regular Beaurepaire. A favorite dodge of his
when he’s in danger is to dive to the bottom, bite on
to a snag, and lie in perfect security for hours. In
length'he runs up to about three feet. I always took
him for a harmless neighbor till lately. Then, searching
for my breakfast egg, I noticed a small member of the
family nosing into a nest on the bank. After a bit of
manoeuvring he managed to roll an egg over the edge
and down the slope. On its way it struck a stick, and
salamander junior breakfasted at his leisure. Eggs
were plentiful, and I was feeling pretty good (Ed
heard the night before that Eurythmie had won the
Caulfield Cup), so didn’t interfere. A few days later
however, I caught an elder of the tribe carting off
one of my prize chickens, and we’ve been in a state
of war ever since.
*** * .
“lotefa”: The Bulletin for June 17 has
just arrived, and I rush into print to confirm “Luke
Tlirice’s” statement about the large number of
albinos in the Islands. Niue certainly has them.
The supposed Swede he met in l’a go Pago has a
sister who, like himself, is an albino. There are
two families here (Niue) each of four children, two
males and two females in each, and one male and
one female in each family, are albinos. The others
are pure brown. There is no relationship between
these three families. The natives believe that if
a pregnant woman pokes fun at an albino her child
and all future children will be born albinos. One
woman, bolder than rest, said she would try.
She had borne two brown children. Her other two
are albinos.
“Boomerang”: In the hands of an expert
a boomerang can be made to return from left or
right by simply changing the end held in the hand.
1 nominate the Central Queensland throwers as the
best handlers of the weapon. In the finest exhibition
of throwing that it has ever been my good luck to
witness an abo. kept five ’rangs alive in the air
continuously for close on five minutes. The same
’fellow broke the two fore legs of a camp dog, stand-
ing 30 yards distant, with two consecutive throws.
* * * *
“Jim Carew”: Can kangaroos swim? I
have seen them plunge into a shallow creek and
struggle across where the actual swimming was only
a few yards, but I have never seen one of them do
more. I fancy ’roo carries too much weight in his
hind-quarters, and in deep water would assume the
vertical position of a dead marine. Yet I know that
hundreds of men out back swear the ’roo can swim
well as long as he doesn’t get his ears wet.
“Urewera”: One of the earliest European
visitors to Maoriland was Crozet, who spent some
time at the Bay of Islands in 1772, and he noticed
the presence amongst the Maoris of fair, rufous
people. He says: “I saw several who had red
hair. There were some- who were as white as our
sailors, ahd we often saw on our ships a tall young
man, sft. llin. high, who by his color and features
might easily have passed for a European,” Crozet
distinguished three separate layers of Maoris —the
fair ones, a yellow or light-brown type and others
dark brown, almost black. He remarked: “It is
most certain that the white ones are the aborigines.”
Later writers have reversed this view and seen in
the mixing of colors the imposition of the rule of
a lighter-colored race on the darker negroid abo-
rigines. But, according to Macmillan Brown, the old-
time French voyager was near the mark and the
older inhabitants were fair people of European affini-
ties who entered Polynesia from north-eastern Asia,
via Japan and Micronesia, in the palaeolithic age,
NOTHING TO SHOW FOR IT.
“Bill, if yer can't shee what I can shee
y’muster bin wastin’ y’ time during our
holiday in Bourke.”
and the dark people came in later from south-
eastern Asia and the Malay Archipelago, bringing a
Melanesian or negroid strain with them. As to the
red-headed Maoris, they are numerous in the long-
isolated King Country districts, near Kawhia, from
which Europeans were excluded, aftd not uncom-
mon amongst the Ureweras in the mountainous
interior of the North Island, who have had little to
do with Europeans until lately. In them Brown sees
the relics of a fair race which occupied Madriland
ages ago.
SULLIVAN’S BRIDGE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Sullivan’s Bridge at Murchison
Was built o’er Buffer's tide
To link the hill that the church is on
With the hills on the other side.
And the tree that the morepoiK perches on
With the place where the bitterns bide.
i To Sullivan’s Bridge at gloaming time
A light-limbed lady paced,
And evening time was roaming time
For a bush lad solemn-faced,
And all the time was foaming time
For the river surge that raced.
Said he, “Tiff the rapids fret no more
I’ll love you night and day;
Tiff the lashing waters wet no mote
The weathered boulders grey.”
Alas, for those who met no more
And the word a girl could say!
When morepijrks’’ cries were wailing down
The bush-dimmed, lonely spur,
The bitterns saw him sailing down
'Where slackened waters >si ir-
A poor, drowned lad went trailing down
For hopeless love of her.
On Sullivan’s Bridge at Murchison
Two ghosts meet every night—
One comes from the hill that the church is on
And one from the waters white;
And the river laughs as it lurches on
To tho far, wide ocean light.

wrote vivid little scenes pointing steadily
to flotsam and death, coloring all the world
with the drab of his narrow vision of the
small, unfit percentage; or he wrote wild
melodramas made worthless by their bastard
setting of literary thought in place of action.
Out of dirt and drink Ernest Dowson sang
a plaintive, half-contrite song of promiscuous
tavern-loves, of the despair tugging at all
human hope, the bitterness deep in the
shadowy, passing sweetness. Richard le
Gallienne was vacuous, almost idiotic in
his use of tinkling, empty words, straining
the limits of the language far beyond the
power of its endurance, and founding a
school of childish prose-preciosity whose
echoes burble in the magazines to-day.
Henry Harland wrought the same evil upon
thought—fustian, tear-stained thought—as
Le Gallienne on words; his whole literary
life was “like a weak rhyme,” falling
precipitately to the prettiness of “The
Cardinal’s Snuffbox” and “Grey Roses.”
Yeats, Verlaine, John Davidson, Max
Beerbohm, all stand the test of un-
biased criticism —that is to say, of
criticism not over-lenient to the fighting
cause of renascence, and not blinded by its
participation in the cause —but in so far as
they touch the narrow literary phase called
“the ’nineties” their work is retrograde.
Beardsley and Wilde were the captains
of the decadent army; Wilde for the con-
crete evidence of his money-making plays,
and Beardsley for the transcendent genius
inspiring his work. The rank and file posed,
lacked humor, played solemnly with a dozen
“magic” words, affected deliberately a false
view for the sake of its “charming” false-
ness. Sin was their brother —not for his
beaux yeuw, but for his quality of sin—
and their literary motive, in so far as indi-
vidually they had a motive, was freedom
carried if possible to the point of sin. All
life was art (“Art doesn’t copy Nature —
Nature copies Art”), from the drinking of
strange drinks to the wearing of significant
neckties. Inspiration was the thing; no
man must put pen or pencil to paper until
the spirit moves him —a lie which kills a
thousand good men every year—so no man
worked. He sat in cafOs and taverns talk-
ing, asserting his right to get drunk, to
wear green carnations, to go dirty into the
street, to take lights o’ love preferably a
bit tight flamboyantly to Benediction (for
the joke only), to affront and embarrass as
shockingly as possible the 99 per cent, of
the world which was Philistine. Mean-
time he awaited inspiration. Which will be
about enough bad to say of the capering,
long-suffering period, I think.
Oscar Wilde was an egoist sunk pitifully
deep in his faith in Oscar Wilde, an unstable
man. too weak to stand success; but his
brilliant social mind (which was in no way
literary) made taste a quality of everybody.
He cut antimacassars, waxflowers and plush
out of the heart of England, as he cut them
out of her rooms, letting the air in for ever.
Beardsley’s drawings found the path for
a new art of illustration. I« it the illus-
tration is at once a relative and a separate
creative expression. The drawings for
“Salome” adhere to the spirit of the degen-
erate, artificial matter and illustrate it
faithfully: yet they mock the play—stand
on their own feet, as it were, ,and laugh at
the solemn stuff they are illuminating.
Quite half the best black-and-white men
drawing to-day do, in their degree and
for their subjects, the same dual thing in
Beardsley’s path. That apart from his im-
mortal legacy to the world’s black-and-white.
Crackanthorpe added the dreariness of the
unfit to the stock-in-trade of letters. Giss-
ing did so too; but Gissing was no
hand at causes and renascences; he
was too wretchedly unfit himself to bother
about stocks-in-trade. So Crackanthorpe did
the publicity-work for them both, and for
us coming after them. Dowson spoke the
truth in his verse; he enlarged for the
minor poets’ level the field of journalist-
verse to include in it the subjects of which
a man was not supposed to write, save when
his genius excused him. And Harland and
Le Gallienne put the precision of daintiness
into English journalism, if they put also
the burble which is its abuse. Pick up a
magazine of the ’seventies or ’eighties and
read the frantic stodge the men had to
fight against; a lightness descending far
lower than “The Cardinal’s Snuffbox” and
“The Quest of the Golden Girl” was a gift
straight from Heaven.
The ’nineties—-the rank and file and their
Cumulative influence —made the possibility
of the acceptance of the article lam writing
now; they threw open the doors of print
for the lay-critic. In their fight with the
old. dry gods with inside Parnassus-infor-
mation they broke down the barricades
between Parnassus and the street. And the
schoolboys who write the English best-
sellers, the many men short of 30 who died
in arms a couple of years ago with good
books to their names, the miner-novelists,
the jockey-poets, the plumber-artists and I
all came over the wreckage to say at least
what we could.
These men, rapscallions, criminals, drunks,
lazy, affected, made literary form in current
English letters. Surely if very slowly they
are purging even the daily press of jour-
nalese. Their adherence to form taught
Fleet-street to write, in place of the ancient
giving of information and opinions. Their
silly slogan of “art for art’s sake” has stiff-
ened to “some art for the ordinary free
mind’s sake,” which is the freedom that
British letters walks in to-day and to-
morrow.
FRANCIS BRIEN.
A Satchel of Books
Jan, by M. Morgan Gibbon (Hutchinson).
A .story of a wayward Welsh girl, with good
character-drawing, enough plot to maintain
the interest, and a wholesome atmosphere.
Incidentally, there is a good picture of life
at Girton.
The Disappearance of Kimball Webb, by
Rowland Wright (Dodd, Mead, New York).
A very slight mystery yarn, beaten out very
thin, with much tedious repetition, recording
the work of some detectives, amateur and
otherwise, who deserve never to have another
job.
British Secret Service During the Great
War, by Nicholas Everitt (Hutchinson).
Though recommended by Lord Northcliffe,
this is quite unworthy of the subject. Pro-
bably Northcliffe recommended it because of
its digressions, in the course of which he
refers jn his usual' slipshod and wordy way
to the chief of the Times as “the one man
amongst men who has done most towards
the winning of the war.” It certainly could
not have been for what Everitt tells about
the work of the Secret Service; and it is
doubtful whether he was allowed to know
.very much. *
The Landscapes of Penleigh Boyd (Alex.
McCubbin and Co., Melbourne) is a well-
printed volume containing 11 reproductions
that reveal much of the color and craft of
the originals. The frontispiece represents
“The Hush of Dawn,” a canvas that excited
much attention at Boyd’s last exhibition in
Melbourne, and among the other prints are
aspects of the bush and city in silvered gums
and shining buildings that demonstrate a
quality of picture-making combining the
forcefulness of the realist with the lyric fancy
of the poeL James Macdonald provides a
treatise on Boyd’s art in some nicely-turned
English at the end of the book.
In the Claws of the Dragon, by G. S. De
Morant (George Allen and Unwin). Mor-
ant, who wears numerous Chinese decora-
tions and i.s one of the greatest living
authorities on Chinese literature, has pro-
duced a book of absorbing interest. One
rebels at first at the light way in which
he marries his heroine to Ming-ni, Viscount
of Lin, First Secretary to the Ambassador
of China in Paris, and Mackensie, the
Scotch engineer of the new inland Chinese
railway, to Red Peony, the daughter of
Wang, a scholar of the First Degree. But
these marriages are necessary in order that
the Chinese wife of the European may ex-
plain to the French wife of the Chinese the
Oriental view of a wife’s duty and vice versa:.
Apart from its story value, the book lets
you into the mind of the Chinese, and is
well worth buying.
The Last Days of the Romanoffs, by
Robert Wilton (Thornton Butterworth,
London). Wilton was the special corres-
pondent of the Times, and attached himself
to the investigating magistrate who had
been appointed by Kolchak to inquire into
the end of the Romanoffs. The official ver-
sion of the Bolsheviks before they fled from
that part of Siberia was that “Nicholas
Romanoff had been executed after trial, and
the family had been removed to a safe
place.” The investigating magistrate,
assisted by Wilton and a few others, took
scores of depositions, examined and photo-
graphed the neighborhood, and had no diffi-
culty in coining to the conclusion that the
ex-Czar and his family and what was left
of his staff were simply butchered in one
of the rooms of the house to which they had
been transferred. As to who stood
the butchers Wilton summarises (p. 156) :
When in 1915 he [the Kaiser] wrote to the Czar
asking him to recall the days when they were friends,
and Nicholas... .replied that those days must for
ever be forgotten, Wilhelm of Hohenzollern started
the maehinery that was to sweep out of existence the
Czardom and Russia and the hapless Romanoffs. In
the autumn of 1915 there assembled in Vienna the
representatives of the German and Austrian general
staffs to discuss a plan for the promotion of a revo-
lutionary movement in Russia. It was then that all
the outlines of the “Russian” revolution were laid
down.... The money that financed the “Russian”
revolution was German money, and (I say it on the
strongest evidence, which can be corroborated in the
German secret archives) Yankel Sverdloff received
a salary from the Germans till November 7, 1917,
when, becoming Red Czar of All the Russias, he had
at his disposal loot unimaginable.
In Wilton’s view the whole dreadful Russian
business has been the work of Jews, used in
the first place by Germans. “Why? Because
the Jews were not Russians, and to them the
destruction of Russia was all in the way of
business.” But surely the time has come to
cut out the theory that the Jewish leaders of
Sovietism are all mercenaries. Some no doubt
are —and were. But there is quite enough
evidence to justify the conclusion that many,
probably the majority, are zealots, struggling
for the utterly impracticable, but sincere
nevertheless. Sincerity is, however, quite an
over-rated virtue. It is hardly more a virtue,
indeed, than thoroughness. And one can be a
thorough blackguard while another is a
thorough gentleman.
The Maher of Pearls, by S. W. Powell
(N.S.W. Bookstall series). A good yarn of
the Islands. A professor, who desires that
every shop-girl should have ropes of pearls,
sets to work to teach oysters to grow them.
There is plenty of adventure, some humor
and a perfectly satisfactory ending.
The Heart of U nag a, by Ridgwell Cullum
(Chapman and Hall, London). A capital
adventure-story of Northern Canada, with
all the material of a first-class novel in addi-
tion to the thrills of the icy trail. Char-
acters are - well drawn; the plot intricate
and well conceived ; the color always good.
Adventures in Southern Seas, by George
Forbes (Australasian Publishing Co.). To
Mr. Forbes, a grandson of the first Chief
Justice in Australia and son of an old-
time N. S. Wales Judge, the Mitchell
Library is wife and child; and he has in-
fused some of the spirit of early Australian
exploration into this capital book for boys.
The story, full of stirring adventure, is
built on the voyages of Dirk Hartog in the
early years of the 17th century, and put
into the mouth of Peter Van Bu, who, after
passing through enough perils by land and
sea to satisfy any boy, is found in the last
chapter talking over the future of a little
Peter. From which it may be rightly con-
jectured that it is a love-story, too.

“Copabella”: With the opening of the
wheat season tjiere is a boom in carpentry ;
and never were there so many members en-
rolled in the ranks of the Carpenters and
Joiners’ Society, once an aristocratic union
of skilled workers. Some of the older trades-
men, jealous for their craft, sought to have
a standard of skill established, suggesting
so many years’ experience at the trade or the
serving of a proper apprenticeship. But the
thing had gone too far; the society was
not game to try to reintroduce such a rule.
On the other hand it laid it down that if
employers were willing to pay a man award
rates, even though he did not know a chisel
from a turnserew, it should be taken that
the man was carpenter enough to be worth
it; and that, as a corollary, he must there-
fore be a carpenter and as such eligible for
the carpenters’ union. So, labor being
scarce, hundreds of men just about able to saw
quartering fairly straight and hit a nail on
the head once every three cracks are earning
big money under the aegis of the Carpenters’
Society.
“Hobo”: The Mt. Lyell copper people are
doing almost as njueh as the smelting co.
at Pt. Pirie in the way of welfare work.
If you are hard up in Melbourne and want
toil, but haven’t got the fare across the straits,
you needn’t worry: if you look the sort of
man they require they will pay your fare to
Strahan, where you board the company’s
train for Gormanston. If you are married
you can get a decent house to live in at
about the lowest rent in the Commonwealth;
moreover, meat, smallgoods, groceries, cloth-
ing and boots are available at the co.’s stores
at reasonable prices. When the rest of the
Speck was paying Is. per lb. for mutton, the
co. was selling it at 7d. Sirloin of beef was
Is. 6d. elsewhere: here it was lid. If you
are single there is the co.’s boarding-house
where the tucker and doss are good and
the tariff low. There is also a pastime club
with a billiard-room, a library and a coffee-
and-roll supper. On Sundays the co. runs ex-
cursion trains to the seaside —fare; 2s. 6d.
return j ordinary times 11s.
“Sixenate”: The psychic fraud who tells
the credulous their fortunes for certain pieces
of silver is not always the deliberate im-
postor that mp.ny people suppose. Sometimes
she —it is generally a she —has a blind faith
in her own powers, and a suburban seer who
has found the game so profitable that she
has latterly abandoned the charing profession
in order to unveil the future to silly women,
struck trouble with the police. Directly she
got the missive which mentioned that George
of Windsor desired her presence at the local
hall of justice, she consulted herself on the
cards as to the probable result of the pro-
ceedings. The cards told her that she would
be fined 55.; and she communicated the glad
-tidings to her sympathising clients' with the
assurance that she felt no fear. But a stony-
hearted beak made the penalty a fiver, and
her reputation as a soothsayer has slumped
to such an extent that a return to the wash-
tub seems imminent.

“Moe”: One of the local forms of currency
anfong Brown Brother in New Guinea is
dogs’ teeth. Village status in some parts is
established by the number of strings of teeth
possessed; and with them anything from a
young wife to a fat pig may be purchased.
About a year ago a Japanese firm imported
from Tokio a large quantity of porcelain
dogs’ teeth for trading purposes, and so far
the local nig has not wakened up to the joke.
In many parts of Australia’s new territories
bucks may be seen strutting about in proud
possession of a couple of strings of the
counterfeit coinage, most of which has now
been absorbed into circulation. The teeth
are excellent imitations, for better work
having been put into them than the Jap puts
into most things that he tackles, and it is
not improbable that Brown Bro. will never
discover the deception.

“Goats for sale: three nannies mated to Angora
billy, and few voung billies. All fit to kill.”
—S. M. Herald advt.
Cold-blooded, callous miscreants who, at this season,
When Christian goodwill is on every tongue,
With goose and turkey, ham, lamb with green peas on
The loaded plate as Christmas bells are rung;
Vilest of murderers who are worse than heathen,
Cannot the Word, by even chinks or crannies,
Reach you; by selfishness both crowned and
wreathen,
That you can sell to bondage three poor nannies?
That them you take from their Angora billy,
Who long will baa in the vain hope of meeting
Again the wives whose absence makes him silly,
While they shall waste their days in futile bieat-
ing ;
And, baser crime, while parsons yet are preaching
Of peace on earth and unto all goodwill,
Ye lose the practice of the Church’s teaching
And advertise “young billies fit to kill” ?
Ah, murderers all! There comes to ye Nemesis
For all this bloodshed for the good of cooks;
The ghosts of Christmas dead prepare a thesis
Of a wild justice all unwrit in books;
Ducks, geese and chooks, and turkeys cry for sen-
tence
For murders done in token of goodwill!
Swift be ye vegetarians, repentant
Of plots against “young billies fit to kill.”
For when at last that justice shall be done
For all the death due to carnivorous man ;
When brought into the fierce light of the sun,
Murders long hid, Chief-Justice Pelican,
And Chook, K.C., as counsel for the Crown,
And Duck the junior counsel files his bill,
Turkey and goose and lamb shall lamb ye down,
And ye shall face young billies, fit to kill.

Beefbohm Tree didn’t mind telling a story
against himself, vain as he was of his acting.
The recently-published book about him has
this one. “You might think I want to flatter

man coming out of the pit said there wasn’t
more than a dozen or so actors in your line
of business as could play the part better.”
“Glen Huntly”: A film co. advertises in
London Times for a university professor of
sociology, psychology and scientific research
to assist a producer in casting plays. In
future, presumably, it Will not be sufficient
for a fat film actor to possess a repertoire of
grimaces and an ability to withstand an un-
limited amount of assault and battery at the
hands of other members of the cast: he will
have to demonstrate his psychological fitness
for the job of comic victim-in-chief. In time,
doubtless, the principle of scientific selection
will be carried further, and the ornate lady
who has been accustomed to represent vam-
pires may have her bumps felt by the film
co’s. stipendiary phrenologist and be informed
that she is sociologically unsuited to any role

“Pawnticket”: Judge Scholes dropped
heavily on a bad police habit at the Dar-
linghurst sessions. A John Hop in the
witness-box referred to the prisoner as
having been “in custody on another charge” ;
whereupon the Judge remarked that this
“backhanded way of giving evidence of bad
character” was becoming offensive, and
advised the police to drop it. There are
other practices they should be advised to
drop also. When the usual inquiry is made
about “previous convietioris” Robert has td
admit sometimes that the accused has never
been in trouble before, but often contrives
to add that he consorts with suspected • per-
sons, has been under the eye of the police
for weeks, and had a second cousin who
received three years for burglary. This, of
course, is not evidence, since nothing but
the policeman’s word is produced, but it
does a lot to weight the balance in an
accused man’s disfavor.
Christmas-boxes were distributed all round
before the Vic. Parliament wound up the
session. In addition to the extra £2OO a
year provided for all Assembly mem-
bers, the Parliamentary Railway Com-
mittee had £3OO a year tacked on
to the £l2OO already appropriated for
fees. This will mean an average of £5O a
year more for each. Cocky was made glad
by the passing of an Act granting the phos-
phate co. he supports a factory site of 13
acres out of 42 acres earmarked for the
Metro. Gas Co. at Spotswood. The value at
which the land is assessed will have to be
paid, but previously the area was supposed
to be sacrosanct. The Metro. Gas Co. had a
little x\.ct put through to enable it to
increase its capital without any awk-
ward stipulations, and perhaps that is
Why it didn’t growl about the phosphate-
factory site at Spotswood. Some adroit
mind in the Cabinet has been showing
Lawson how to keep sweet with everybody.
The public pays—but what else is the public

“Lex”: The S. Aus. Supreme Court has
convicted a highly respectable furniture firm
of conducting a game of chance in the form
of a “Limerick competition.” Four lines were
given, and one had to be supplied, with a £lO
prize and others hanging on the result. The
Court agreed with the prosecuting counsel
that “no special literary talent was required
to supply the missing line, and the case was
clearly one of chance.” As, however., it
thought that to establish the principle was
sufficient, there was a conviction without a
penalty. But what principle has been
established? Certainly not that no ingenuity
—to claim the very least—is ever required to
complete a Limerick. For instance :
A copper of South Australia
Struggles his hardest to gaol yeh;
Then he comes to a beak
Who tries for a week
To
It certainly is a matter of chance whether
you complete the line as I complete it; but if
Justice Gordon, who could probably finish up
that Limerick better than any other man in
S. Australia, was entrusted with the job,
wouldn’t it be a fair thing to offer a prize to
anybody who got nearest his line?

pleton’s father, had its office <sn the ground
floor. Then the Bank of New Zealand took the
place of the Trustees Co. Upstairs fortunes
were made and lost by men who are being for-
gotten, but whose efforts established two
great companies—Broken Hill Proprietary
and Mount Lyell, with all their offshoots.
The late Wm. Knox, the real genius of the
group, took the B.H.P. there, and his lieu-
tenants, Thos. Rollason, John. Brandon and
Alfred Mellor, took every other company of
any importance in those days. There George'
MacCulloch signed the first cheque for Syl-
vester Browne to take up the first 5000
shares in Bayley’s Reward; and W. R.
Wilson bought St. Albans there and formed
the Barrier Ranges Association of rich
Broken Hill speculators and the Octagon
Syndicate. W. P. MacGregor, the chairman
of the B. Id. Proprietary, had a room in
the building. George Brockman sold £lO
shares in the original Coolgardie Prospect-
ing Association, which owned the Golden
Mile at Kalgoorlie, to most of the occu-
pants of the offices, who generally sold out
on thf first rise like unbelievers usually do.
And Colin Templeton,' F. M. Dickenson,
Alfred Mellor, Duncan Macßryde, Harvey
Patterson, Bowes Kelly and Willie Jamie-
son were to be seen at 39 every day, living,
dreaming and working amidst millions.

Just by a finger pressure from the seat of
your car you can spin your motor. No
matter what make bf automobile you own
you can make it a self-starter.
Many cars are not up-to-date because a dangerous
crank has to be swung every time a start has to
be made, and because they lack electric lights.
Benefit by the experience of thousands of satisfied
users and equip your car with the *
HEINZE-SPRINGFIELD
Starting s Lighting System
SPECIAL TYPE FOR FORDS.
Then, in addition to easy, sure and safe starting, you have bright
steady electric lights all the time you want them, or dimmed lights
for traffic driving or parking purposes.
Bright or dimmed lights are obtained merely by pulling a handy
little button.
Another highly desirable point gained by installing the Heinze-Springfield
Electric Cranking and Lighting System, is that when you park your car
you lock it with the ignition off and the light dim.
Many strong tests have been made, but all have proved that there is no
perceptible decrease in horse-power caused by the generator of the Heinze-
Springfield system.
The whole device is out of sight under the bonnet. It does not interfere with
the accessibility of any part of the engine, and once bolted into position it
becomes as much a part of the machine as if it were moulded there in the factory.
Let us send you full details.

George V. will have to consent before
members of the Vic. Assembly can draw
£5OO a year, as an amendment of the Con-
stitution is involved. But as the Lppah
Chamber conceded the extra £2OO for mem-
bers of another place without turning a
hair, there will be no 1 trouble, and the in-
creased pay will be retrospective, dating
from October 21.
“Boorara”: He was a Tommy sub. He
affected a drawl and an eyeglass, his uni-
forms were gorgeous, and we were sure he
wore stays. One day in the Jordan Valley
a bomb dropped within 10 feet of his bivvy,
and when the smoke lifted we found him un-
conscious and almost naked. But he swam
back from Slumberland and gazed ruefully
on the wreckage. “Wotten luck, weally,”
he sighed. “Spoilt m’ bally Judpores.”
John Junius Morgan (nephew of Pierpoint
and a member of the firm) likes to take
Australian talent under his wing in London;
and his big studio at No. G Sloane Square,
with its £30,000 worth of art treasures, makes
rather a wonderful background for these
gatherings. Sid Long is the latest on the list
—Morgan has been a large buyer of Sid s
water-colors and etchings. Otherwise, too,
thd Sydney man is threatened with success.
He lias Keen made hon, secretary to the
Society of Graphic Arts, Mayfair is taking
his etchings, and they say he will soon have
the letters “R.A.E.” tacked on to his name.
J. H. Curie is at the moment in the Sahara
en route for Timbuctoo. After that it is
down the Niger and across the desert for a
thousand miles to Kano in Northern Nigeria.
His last post-mark was Dprban, where lie
was charmed to be once more among the
“greatest gentlemen” of the world —the Zulus.
One of these, horns and all, had dragged the
six-foot-odd writer about for hours, singing
as he ran, and frequently jumping in the air
for pure joy. Curie’s new book, “This World
of Ours,” will be in Australia very soon now.
He likes it better than “The Shadow Show,
and so do the publishers.
“Country Surgeon” : The divorce between
ordinary commousense and officialdom is
not confined to the Army. A request came
to me recently from the head of a depart-
ment of the N. S. Wales railways for a cer-
tificate that the unfortunate victim of an
engine accident some nine months ago, both
of whose legs had to be amputated at the
knee-joints, is still unable to pursue his
regular duties as a fuelman. In addition,
the official medical certificate form asks me
to state that the legless man will be
unable, in my opinion, to resume his regular
duties “for at least -from date.’ _ I
don’t believe he will ever grow another pair,
so I filled in the words “for his lifetime.
The recently revised version of the English
woman’s idea of the Australian man comes
out in a new Croker novel, “The Chaperon.
This one “had the clear-cut profile of an
Apollo Belvedere —delicate nostrils, short
upperlip, small ears, complete; beside this
a head of fair hair, with a natural wave,
and a pair of deep-set blue eyes. His
figure was well proportioned and graceful.
If she had beheld him standing on the steps
of a throne she~ would not have been sur-
prised.” But the author pairs him off with
“a loutish, ill-mannered heiress,” who, as
somebody remarks, “with her fine constitu-
tion, her good temper and her common-
sense, not to speak of her fortune, will make
a very suitable wife for a colonial.”
When motors, bikes and mixed horse-
drawn vehicles had been going over the edge
at Hannan’s Gap, Gippsland, for several
years, the shire council sent out a gang ot
workmen, who cut the road well into the hill
at the turn, and erected a substantial railing
on the dangerous side. Then it was that the
council heard from Mike Hannan. _ Mike
broke into the council chamber, bringing his
inflammatory whiskers with him, and defying
rule and precedent addressed the council with
ferocity and profanity. “Fer the good iv the
dishthriet ye done it, I’m told,” he snorted
“Good iv the dishthriet, is ut? Fat lot iv
sarvice ’twill do the dishthriet, trowin good
money away. Them min fell on me land paid
handsome, let me tell yeh, and fhere was no
nade for anny road at all, and no call fer
anny railin’, seein’ I treated them was liurted
as well as anny hospital ’n’ better. Did eer
a wan complain iv me treatment, 111 ask
yeh? Didn’t ivry man, woman ’n’ child get
the good doctorin’ frim me missus, ’n’ good
bed ’n’ board most raysonable. Good fer the
dishthriet! Good fer the dishthriet. Ijook it
here, you there, Tom Moran, prisident iv
the Shire, if y’d left that piece iv road alone
’twas me intintion to irrict a sannytorium.
D’yeh hear that? A sannytorium! Would
have bin a pride and a profit. Now, ye ve
druv away me bizness, I’m sellin’ out n
goin’, ,’n’ be damned to the lot iv yez! Here
Hannan was hustled off the premises blowing,
“Good iv the dishthriet! Good iv tne dish-
thrict!” through his tangle of red whiskers
with inconceivable disdain.
“Harrison O.” from London :—-
One of my complaints against the city fathers of
Australia is their failure to provide comic side-shows
such as the London proletariat gets gratuitously.
Dick Whittington in all his pantomimic glory was
not arrayed like Alderman Rolls when he was
trundled from the Guildhall to the Law Courts in
a fairy ■ chariot on the ninth of November. The
circus coach, as heavily gilded as a Dago oyster-
joint, was drawn by white horses, prinked with
rosettes and pretty fal-de-lals, while beside the be-
wigged driver sat a beadle who had escaped fiom one
of Cruickshank’s pictures and was longing to get
back again. Behind the coach sat footmen, uphol-
stered like the plush suite of a boarding-house draw-
ing-room ; then came the mounted band of the Life
Guards, wearing gold skirts, ending about the knee,
and caps such as are favored by the clerk of the
course at Flemington. Merry-go-round vehicles
crowded with rabbit-skin potentates, postillions
wearing rosettes the size of circus hoops, and
retainers with padded calves and ill-fitting velvet'
knee-breeches, paraded past a grinning populace,-
while bells shrieked their mirth, and drums were
beaten as though the Day of Judgment was orv
liand. Members of ancient Guilds, wearing cocked
hats and Velvet opera-cloaks, and elderly gentlemen
in epicene garments of plush and fur, carried gilded
waddies ; and somewhere in the cast was the sword,
with which a former Gaud Mayor slew Wat Tyler.:
London took a couple of hours off to see the circus,
and returned to work in a more cheerful frame of
mind. I am sure that similar shows in Australia
would be an immense success, especially if produced
by Minnie Everett.

EE you the Managing Director of
a Company? Do you feel that
you have passed beyond the
point where added training will increase
your effectiveness ?
Here are more than 20,000 business
heads who investigated and convinced
themselves that they could profit by
the accumulated experience of other
successful men.
Are you a manager, a salesman, air
auditor,*an engineer? —-it matters not.
In fhe -list somewhere are men in your
position, and in every line of business,
whose problems are precisely like yours.
Businesses differ only in details;
this .fundamental truth applies to all;
the man who knows all departments —
sales, accounting, factory and office
management, cost, advertising" and cor-
poration finance —is the man who is
equipped for the positions of higher
executive responsibility.
Growth of the Institute.
np , » EX years ago an institution in
Xew York City conceived the
* splendid enterprise of saving
years that are wasted in the lives of
ambitious men.
It set out to assemble a corps of
business experts; it secured the co-
operation of an Advisory Council con-
sisting of the ablest educational and
business authorities. It gathered into
the course of systematic, practical read-
ing, the best experience and methods
the leaders of Modern Business.
The Alexander Hamilton Institute
was an experiment ten years ago; it
stands to-day an Institution of proven
power. More than 120,000 men have
enrolled in its Modern Business Course
and Service. They are its living adver-
tisement ; on their success- its pre-
eminence is laid.
Here you will find a list of 120,000 men who
have enrolled in the Alexander Hamilton
Institute, classified according to the positions
that they held at the time of their enrolment;
NUMBER OP
Find your own position in this table. If
you feel that your business is ‘‘different,
remember that each one of these subscribers
came to the Institute because he realised that
he needed to know more about the great fun-
damental principles underlying all business.
Every business differs in its details, but
every business man benefits by becoming
more familiar with the problems that are
being met and solved in other departments
and in other lines.
The • Institute now offers to business
men in Australia the same service
which has hitherto been available to
business men of the United States and
Canada. The organisation is com-
plete in every detail.
Decision: An essential to success.
T' lIE difference between the suc-
cesses and the tragedies of lifp
is expressed usually in one
single word—-Decision.
Two men read the facts regarding
life insurance; both have the good in-
tention to act. One man does act; and
the other waits until it is too late.
Two men covet progress. One man
will read this advertisement and act,
and a year from now will have made
greater progress toward business .suc-
cess.
The other will hesitate; and next
year will find him just where he is.
to-day.
You have decision. Decide now that
you will spend a single evening in
investigating a training that has done
so much for other men* whose problem
was precisely like -your own.
Investigation is easy.
TO make investigation easy, the
Institute has published a 116-
page book, “Forging Ahead in
Business.” It is a book of facts and
letters—facts about the scope of tne
Institute’s training, and letters from
men who tell just what that training
has done for them. It is a valuable
book; and it is free. A copy is wait-
ing for you. Send for it now.

“The Welcome Stranger,” which opened
at Sydney Palace on New Year’s Night, is
a good play for three acts ; then it fizzles out
in a fourth, of the “Get Rich Quick Walling-
ford” order, that must have made the
writer shed tears of blood. Of course the
play is American-builit, but with a difference
that makes it up to a certain point a charm-
ing comedy of human nature. Although
the central character is a Jew, the
play is nowise a glorification of Israel, for
the villain of the piece is also of the tents
of Kedar, and makes himself -disliked by a
revolting disposition and a tendency to
adenoids. Briefly the story concerns one
Isadore Solomon who, leaving Boston because
of the prejudice displayed towards his race,
decides to settle in a small New England
town and make a fresh start in the rag busi-
ness. But in Little Valley he finds a preju-
dice even stronger and more bitter. On the
night of his arrival the big men of the town
enter into a conspiracy, first to turn him
out of the only hotel into a biting storm,
and later on to run him out of the place
altogether. However, Isadore’s friendliness
wins over first Clem Beemis, general help at
the hotel —he prefers to be called town elec-
trician —and next the clerk, and the act ends
in Isadore, after hearing the plans of the
genius Clem (John D. O’Hara) for electric-
lighting the town from the power of the
local falls, deciding to throw in his avail-
able capital—lso dollars—and become Clem’s
partner. When all except the howling wind
is still, and Isadore is left for the night in
the hotel lobby, Lizette Parlies dashes in,
wrapped in inadequate clothing and mystery,
and poor old Izzy has to take off his
overcoat to wrap round her, while he him-
self shelters his knees beneath the doormat
that bears the legend “Welcome.” After that
the play is a story of waifs of fortune who
hang together on a raft that is mainly built
of laughter in spite of the imminence of dis-
aster. Now and then there are moments of
sustained dignity in the dialogue, to be
immediately extinguished in a burst of merri-
ment —easily got sometimes, as when Izzy
complains that fthey won’t have the electric
light because I’m an Israelite.” How Clem
and his ideas prove winners (and John D.
O’Hara comes back to us in his best Light-
nin’ form as the shrinking seer of visions)
how Izzy a<nd he in one year become the
town’s leading citizens, how the mystery
around Mary is cleared up—it was ail told
to the intense enjoyment of the audience at
the Palace on Saturday night.
* * * *
Jules Jordan, in spite of his tubby figure,
which he describes as “not the right shape
for a statoo.” gets
every ounce of fun
out of the quaint
Isadore. invests
him with a kindly
dignity and makes
him a burning pro-
test against the
prejudice of t'h e
Christian to his
race, yet proves
that the character
the author meant
to draw is not
specifically that of
either Jew or
Gentile, for we find
the same springs
o f sweetness i d
Clem Beemis. But
he is rather a n
embodiment of the
Charity that
’postle Paul speaks
about. As the
wicked mayor John
Waller makes an
impression, Pirie
Bush has a tiny
part which is re-
mepibered, and J.
B. Athol w o o d
makes the porter
“The Gondoliers,” at
Sydney Majesty’s.

Toro

Sam quite a personage in the last act.
“Baby Bunting,” with its riot of clothes
and its Dorothy Brunton, has been drawing
with tremendous force at Sydney Criterion
throughout the holidays. According to pre-
sent intentions the show will run for another
five weeks.
* * * *
At the Sydney Tivoli Valentine has been
whirling Ivy Shilling about in her tem-
pestuous dances, Majilton, the lady’s usual
partner, having been laid up for repairs to a
damaged eye. The locum tenens, a some-
what attenuated youth, has found it a strenu-
ous business, for Ivy is quite a big girl
now. Meantime “The Lilac Domino” con-
tinues to move briskly to a tuneful and
colorful conclusion.
*I» *l* »i' '!*
Although the Stewards’ Union is said to
have invited the Society of Amalgamated
Gondoliers to down their pink and blue tights
and walk off, James Hay feels that, absurd
as he looks in pink tights, he would look
more absurd without; so “Tim Gondoliers”
will continue to man Her Majesty’s (Sydney)
for another week or so.
Bert -Lyttell gets every ha’porth of change
out of “The Price of Redemption” that he
pays at Sydney Crystal Palace and Strand.
The same roofs cover Pauline Frederick,
who as an energetic and athletic governess
saves her pupil from an untimely grave and
marries the youngster’s father. Later she
finds a bundle of letters that prove wife
No. 1 never loved hubby, though he trea-
sures her memory rather to the detrimpnt
of the present wife. Then he finds out, and
not even the ghost of a former affection
stands between goyerness and the adored.
“The Bonds of Love” is the title. Jack
London’s “Mutiny on the Elsinore” makes
stirring doings at the Lyceum, with Mitch
Lewis to puL everything right; and Mary
Miles Minter dresses her hair in the most
wonderful style in the giddy tangle-up of
conjugal bliss called “Wives and Other
Wives.” The Globe and Haymarket show
“Below the Surface” and Dorothy Gish
“Remodelling Her Husband”; while Hoyt’s
and the Piccadilly have the thrills of the
week in “Wanted at Headquarters” and
“The Secret of the Monastery.”
As regards “Cinderella” at Melbourne
Princess’s nobody lingers longer in the
memory than Amy Rochelle, the principal
boy. She is of the vivid Idly Iris, Violet
Lorraine type, but also has a voice strong
in color, range and melody. She doesn’t
££t the chances she deserves in this, dis-
turbance. In the final scene of the first act
she is kept hanging about like a super whilst
Stiffy and Mo loiter with intent to commit,
a felony on the .English language. In fact,
these humorists butt into almost every
scene, and some of their alleged comedy will
tempt The Bulletin to send them a couple
of poisoned lagers one of these hot nights.
Warm nights and the keen competition
of three other pantos have somewhat affected
popular enthusiasm for “Sinbad” at the
King’s, and with the further prospect of
shutting up owing t® the expected tram and
train shortage, brought about by the growing
absence of coal, the management is hardly
jumping with joy. To add to the difficulties
of Tait, Bailey and Grant, Elsie Parkes was
missing from the cast last week owing to
an injured knee; and she had hardly returned
to her place in the ballet before Jack Cannot
was away and William Denton was trying
to fill his place and succeeding very poorly.
Gladys Moncrieff has returned to her old
billet in “The Boy” at Melbourne Royal,
wherefore Zoe Wenke, who understudied
Gladys, has to hide her talents in the back-
ground once more. Maudie Fane is still a
noticeable absentee, but Nell Payne is en-
deavoring to fill the gap with large exhibi-
tions of teeth which Maudie, with all her
whims, ever gave sparingly. Mione Stewart
is still showing the quality of the stock she
sprang from, and the energy of Stigant has
not abated.
* * * *
A tall auburn-haired sorceress is still try-
ing to glue the village lunatic to the throne
of Humptiland at Melbourne Majesty’s. This
absurdity, however, is soon forgotten in the
joy of watching the long lines of loveliness
that gleam in crescents of rainbow effects in
the back yard of the show. Every one of
these pictures tells the story of hard and
enthusiastic rehearsals through long hot days,
and the singular feature of all this shapeli-
ness is that never a curve is out of drawing.
This cannot be saicf' of some of the well-
advertised principals.
** * *
At Melbourne Tivoli “Chu Chin Chow”
continues to feel the lack of a central figure
after the style of Asche’s beggar in “Kismet.”
Abu Hasan of “Chu” supplies no thrills, but
merely orders violence in the glum tones of a
mandarin whose dinner of shark’s tail has
disagreed with him. If, instead of posing
in a little toy cart, he strangled a couple of
slaves or started to boil Kasin Baba in oil,
he would have justified his reputation, and
provided picturesque inhuman relief to the
succession of prancing odalisques and love-
sick songs. There is a bit too much syrupy
ballad and tender dalliance in “Chu,” and not
enough argument and blud. Even Abu’s
ferocious retinue seems to have no zest for
its trade. It looks more like a collection of
Arabian wowsers got up to advertise some-
body’s mustard.
Such a show as “Chu Chin Chow,”
where the charm depends much on the
maintenance of complete harmony in the
color, music- and movement of the story, re-
quires unceasing vigilance in stage-manage-
ment. One slacker will mar the effect of a
scene. For instance, there is an entrance by
a troupe of goose-stepping girls in the open-
ing scene where the mock Chinaman sits
enthroned as the guest of Kasim Baba. The
goose-step movement is so well suited to the
situation that one notices the least default
on the part of even one girl. If she spares
herself the effort of a fantastic prance some-
thing is lost from the glamor of the scene.
Not that the girls, in a general way, are as
likely to slump as the male supers. In the
scene of the Robbers’ Cave, when the move-
ment of the motley gang is all-important, one
“BABY BUNTING ,” AT SYDNEY
CRITERION.
Frith singing “Listen, Baby.”
feels that the supernumerary desperadoes are
not all doing their bit according to instruc-
tions at rehearsal. Some of them perfunc-
torily disregard the fact that they are sup-
posed to be very much disturbed by the dis-
covery of a stranger in their treasure house.
But who shall infuse a soul into supers?
Wasn’t it Charles Ivean who spent half an
hour trying to teach an inferior young mum-
mer to speak three words? “Can’t you say
them exactly as I do?” asked Kean. “No, I
can't," said the harassed young man; “if I
could I’d be a star instead of hanging on here
at 15s. a week.”
sj: j’c
At Melbourne Athenaeum this week the
Fisks are indulging in a change of pro-
gaamme \yhich re-introduces a couple more
Jubilee choruses and gives Marshall Palmer
a further innings as “A Son of the Desert”
who reckons civilisation well lost for a hand-
ful of dates. Sid Haynes, who last week
applauded “A Pair of Sparkling Eyes,” has
now dedicated his tenor to “Two Bright
Eyes,” and will probably be warming up on
the subject of Two Brown Orbs when his
turn comes round again. All the other
artists are doing well, particularly Vi Peet,
whose charming little soprano isn’t too boast-
ful of its careful education.
“The Brand of Lopez” brings Sessue
Hayakawa to light at Melbourne Majestic
again this week. Sessue, as a Spanish mata-
dor bursting with love, hate and homicide
and finding violent exercise for a mob of
bandits, puts dynamite in the penny-cracker
class. “Live Sparks,” the follow-on, has a
comparatively pleasant theme, but there are
one or two incidents, including a glove fight,
to kee,p the hardened picture-gazer awake.
At Ployt’s Francesca Bertini, a new and
demonstrative Tosca, has come in. It is a
well-planned bit of trouble by a new Italian
co., and the murder of the naughty Scarpia
gives Tosca her biggest chance to show the
whites 'of her eyes. Hoyt’s have another
restless subject in “A Little Brother of the
Rich,” with Frank Mayo and Kathryn
Adams jostling for the front places in an
Amurkan social drama. The Melba is wor-
ried regarding the whereabouts of “The Blue
Pearl,” and the Britannia’s present concern
is “My Lady’s Garter,” which the Australian
Sylvia Bremer lost at a critical moment.
“8.J.” from London :
“The Drovers’’ is the title of a new one-acter by
Louis Esson, included in “Dead Timber and Other
Plays,” published by the Bomb Shop. It is about
the most characteristically Australian thing Esson
has done since “Dead Timber.” The scene is laid
in a droving camp many miles from anywhere. A
fatuous jackeroo fires at a dingo and startles the
cattle, with the result that one of the drovers is
badly trampled. The cattle are half-mad with thirst,
and the boss drover reckons that it is his job to get
them to their destination. maimed man makes
no complaint at being left behind; he knows that
it is all in the game. He makes a verbal will, leav-
ing his cheque and personal effects to be divided
among his mates, one of whom seeks the dying man’s
advice regarding the purchase of a horse with his
share of the cheque. After touchingly casual fare-
wells, the others push on with the cattle, leaving
their wounded mate in charge of a black boy. After
he has finished the job in hand, the boss is coming
back to bury him. The drover dies at sunrise, and
the curtain falls on the black boy sitting by the
corpse smoking the dead man’s pipe and rubbing
sticks together so as to make a fire to frighten away
debil-debils. The little outback vignette reads effec-
tively, and will probably be staged by the Hampstead
Repertory Theatre, which has lately provided London
with several interesting performances.
Adelaide shows have been mainly a matter
of weather. The end of Wilkie’s Shakspeare
season at the Royal was so cold that a pro-
jected “Twelfth Night” open-air performance
at Government House had to be cancelled.
Within four days the city got such a roast-
ing that indoors became unpopular, Lowell
Thomas getting the worst of it. However, he
had perfect weather after Christmas, and his
American voice was heard by good houses
at the last. Picture-shows —West’s, Wonder-
graph, The Pav., The Grand —run day and
night, and often succeed in being cooler than
the street.
s|c *
Adelaide Repertory Theatre ended its
season with a really sound performance of
Vachell’s “Quinney’s” at the Prince of
Wales’s. Tom Nave was at the top of his
form as the old dealer, and the support was
good; the Rep. has seldom done anything
better. Financially, however, it is much
troubled by h.c.l. Theatre rents and all
other outgoings have increased greatly, the
receipts very little. Unless a few people
are willing to subsidise it—the whole debit
balance in a year is not much if the demand
is at all keen—the first of all Australia’s
Repertory bodies seems headed for the rocks.
* * *
From London: —
The seemingly interminable “Chu Chin Chow,”
now in its fifth year, is likely to be pensioned off
soon and replaced by “Mecca.” Although it is re-
undressed at regular intervals, “Chow” is losing even
the sordid commercial justification it once had for
keeping worthier shows out of one of London’s finest
theatres. Lily Brayton’s part is said to have “got
on her nerves” to an almost unendurable extent, and
she is supposed to have been trying to persuade her
Oscar for some time to cry a go. Apart from a
couple of musical shows, two of the longest-lived
plays in the West End at present are productions
of literary merit —Barrie’s “Mary Rose” and Gals-
worthy’s “The Skin Game.” Both have registered
more than 260 performances. Sara Allgood has a
good part in “The White-headed Boy,” an amusing
Irish comedy with Sinn Fein leanings, which is
doing well at the Ambassadors’. Elsie Thompson, a
Sydney girl, better known in Australia as Elsie
Forreste, and in London as the Maharani of Tikari,
has given a song recital at the yEolian Hall. Her
soprano is rather small, but her appearance and her
habit of making little confidential speeches to the
audience about her songs won her a very friendly
reception. Elsie has embraced the Hindu faith
and was married according to its rites. A young
Maori warbler, Ranee Raal, is appearing at the
Coliseum. He is billed as a “royal baritone,” it
being explained that his father is “King Mahutu,
recognised by the authorities as titular ruler of the
Maoris of the North Island.” Raal served with the
Maoriland forces and gained a commission. Aus-
tralian Haddon Chambers has just re-married, after
having been a widower for many years. The debon-
air playwright has lately spent most of his time in
the U.S. His daughter has artistic notions and a
flat in Chelsea. Halliwell Hobbes, the thin, quiet-
mannered mummer who vfas in Australia first with
Ethel Irving and later with Lewis Waller, has a
good part, and plays it well, in Beaumont and
Fletcher’s “The Knight of the Burning Pestle,”
which has been revived at the Kingsway. One of
the directors of the National Opera Co., which is
doing a capital series of grand-opera revivals at the
Royal Surrey Theatre, is the widow of the late Sir
George Doughty, better known in Australia as
Eugenia Stone, for years The Bulletin’s Melbourne
Chatterer.
While in Melbourne Joseph Graham
searched the cemetery for the grave of Wil-
liam Hoskins, but failed to trace the last
resting-place of Henry Irving’s first dra-
matic coach. He is keen on starting a
movement to place over the remains a .fit-
ting memorial to a great mummer.
“T.p.M.”: Apropos of the huge cast
needed for “Theodore” (B. 7/10/20),
“Cyrano de Bergerac,” produced by Henry
Lee at the Palace Theatre, Sydney, had 74
characters. It was originally done at the
Grand Theatre, Blackpool, England, by
Charles Wyndham, who impersonated the
bulbous-nosed gallant, Mary Moore being the
Roxane of the production. Rostand’s play
was adapted by Stuart Ogilvie and Louis N.
Parker. Will Australia ever see his “Chanti-
cler” ?

“75 ’: A memorial has been erected by
London County Council at 88 Curtain-road,
Shoreditch, the site of the first building put
up in London for the production of plays.
It was called simply The Theatre and was
built in 157 G by James Burbage, who had a
job to keep the place going in the face of
bitter opposition from the Puritans. How-
ever, he had a royal license from Queen Bess
and the support of the nobility. His son,
Richard, England’s first big tragedian, was a
draw, and so was a promising young
dramatist, W ill Shakspeare, whose earlier
plays were performed at this house. When
The Theatre was pulled down in 1598, to
spite a refractory ground landlord, Burbage’s
sons constructed Shakspeare’s Globe Theatre
from the material they carted away.
“Old Pot’’: Australia should once have
heard Caruso. Roberto Ilazon, the conduc-
tor, was % asked to visit an Italian town
some hours’ train journey from Milan to
listen to a candidate for an Australian tour,
but he was so sick of going to impos-
sible tenors that he declined to travel and
hear this one, thinking he would be another
gold brick. After Caruso became famous
Hazon was chagrined to be told that the
tenor to whose voice he would not listen
was Caruso. In his pre-singing days he
was a plumber’s assistant.
“Old Pot”: The screw paid to supers in
the old days (B. 30/12/’2O) has been as low
as 2s. a night, and there was one supposedly
opulent manager who proposed to cut it to
Is. 6d. Many of them were decayed pro-
fessionals, but there were others who found
“The Gondoliers ,” at
Sydney Majesty's.

(Albert Kavanagh).
that the only way
to get a start at
acting was to carry
a banner. At
least one of Aus-
tralia’s foremost
leading-men began
in that way. Super-
ing in those days
meant giving every-
thing else up, be-
cause a man could
not attend rehear-
sals and have an
outside job. So
those who began
supering usually
kept at it and
almost starved on
the 15 bob a week.
Occasionally there
were perks. In
one Sydney pro-
duction rice was
used to maintain
the illusion that
spray was break-
ing over a pier,
and the supers
who were under-
neath the waves
greedily scraped
it up and took it home. But it didn’t last
long: the property master’s bill for rice be-
came so large that it was questioned.
“Nella” : “Yeomen of the Guard’’ had its
Australian premiere at the Princess’s, Mel-
bourne, on April 20, 18S9. Nellie Stewart
was Elsie Maynard ; Billy Elton, Jack Point;
Leumaine, Col. Fairfax. There were others,
but that trinity will take some living up to.

vant) and again Lacy, Act 2; Lacy, Act 3 ;
and Captain Graham Clavering, Act 4—this
when some of the co. were A.W.L. With
Alfred Dampier the wretch who was cast for
I 1 rancisco in "Hamlet” had a busy evening,
for he also had to do Polonius, Second
Gravedigger and young Osric. Old Ned
Holloway invariably did the ghost doubled
with the priest, and no human being could
fail to identify his foghorn voice. In “Rob-
bery Under Arms” I had to set fire to Store-
field’s stable as Daly, the bushranger; exit
hurriedly R.; then dash on L. as George
Storefield to rescue the maddened horses.
And when we could get them on at all, those
backblock horses were very temperamental.
When the good old man is murdered in Act 1,
he invariably arrives as J. Hop later on, and
arrests his own murderer; it is one of the
rules of the game. At Mutton Creek, when
I turned up as the arresting John in Act 3,
a disgusted patron exclaimed unfeelingly,
“ ’Struth! Can’t yer rest in yer blanky
grave?”
“Glen H.”: Thomas Beecham, who recently
appeared in the London Bankruptcy Court,
having lavished oh unprofitable operatic ven-
tures the fortune obtained from his father’s
pill-making business, has two sons, aged 15
and 11, who are following in his musical
footsteps. The elder boy, Adrian, has written
an operatic version of “The Merchant of
Venice,” which is to be produced iii London
during the winter. He has also composed
another opera, two symphonies—with full
orchestral scores —and a ballet. A remark-
able feature of the youth’s work is that it is
“BABY BUNTING,"
AT SYDNEY
CRITERION.
Field Fisher as Giggleswick.
committed to paper in full .score form, instead
of the piano part being made first and the in-
strumentation completed afterward. Another
striking feature of his opera is that he has
succeeded in making the music fit the original
words, gpart from a few remarks given to
Shylock to sing.
“Smike”: Professor White, who is still
fingering the harmonium for the Fisk Singers
in Melbourne, is the last of the original com-
pany that set out from America to educate
the globe in plantation melodies. White is
a graduate of Boston’s big Conservatorium
of Music, and had some French and German
training before he began business as a con-
cert accompanist. ♦ He was the first to start
a course of music at the Tuskegee Institute
under Booker Washington, and he has done
some useful work for Sambo in various other
educational ways. One of his experiences
was an invitation to warble before Paul
Kruger, and this happened just after the
company had given Queen Victoria a recital
at Buckingham Palace.
“C. Ockney”: Joseph Coyne, who is to
open in Sydney in a few weeks under the
J.C.W. banner, is a clean-cut, slim Ameri-
can comedian who has been conspicuous on
London stages for many years. After he
had appeared in various song-and-dance
pieces—Coyne is a remarkably clever dancer
—the late George Edwardes spotted him as
a likely Prince Danilo for his “Merry
Widow” production, and gave him the part
—an experiment justified by results. The
success of the operetta established Coyne
in the West End, where he has been ever
since. He will make his bow in Australia
in a light comedy by Salisbury Field (no
relation to Salisbury Plain) called “Wed-
ding Bells.” From America? Why, cert’nly.
But there is at least one British-made piece
in Joseph’s repertory—“ His Lady Friends,”
Charles Hawtrey’s latest winner.
“George Street” : An enthusiastic admirer
of Gilbert’s work had been maintaining that
it was in a class by itself, and defied imita-
tion. “Not quite,” said a versifier who was
present, “give me a catch-phrase, and I’ll
hang on to it an imitation of Gilbert, here
a nd now.’’ “First thing that comes to hand
—‘injudicious frankness,’ ’’ said the other ;
“now go ahead.” The versifier instantly
produced this :—•
For his injudicious frankness was his bane, was his
bane;
His injudicious frankness was his bane.
His unguarded revelations
And his rash asseverations
Brought unpleasant complications in their train, in
their train—
Brought unpleasant complications in their train.
The sceptic stared. “By Jove, I’ll show that
to Gilbert, and ask him where in his work
it occurs.” He did. Gilbert thought for half a
minute before he said that, though the lines
were doubtless his, he was for the time quite
unable to place them. Of course he never
did place them. Alec Montgomery, now the
veteran among Sydney writers, was the versi-
fier who threw off the jingle on the spur of
the moment.
The only form of culture which appears to
have survived in Russia since Bolshevism
broke loose is the theatre. H. G. Wells,
writing in London Sunday Expkess, says
that when he was in Petrograd recently, al-
though all the shops were shut and shuttered,
4U theatres were open nightly, and it was
™ueh the same in Moscow. The tradition of
official subsidies is maintained, but nobody
pays for a seat. Tickets are distributed
among members of the Red army and their
families for one night, t 6 members of the pro-
fessional unions for another, and so on, each
citizen s place in the house being determined
by ballot.
“Ancient Prompter”: Cass Downing, the
musical conductor from whom Clay Smith,
Lee \Y bite’s husband, recovered damages
for injuries received in a behind-the-scenes
adventure, is in charge of the orchestra at
Melbourne King’s. Cgss in the first instance
objected to a rehearsal for the “full com-
pany” with the stars absent, and that was
the cause of the row. The rank and file
applaud the conductor.
“M.P.A.”: “Stargazer” (B. 2r>/11/’2O),
referring to the luck that utter fools have
with lions and tigers, reminds me of a cer-
tain animal-man who was forbidden to pre-
sent Ins act because he was well tanked, and
the management reckoned he would strike
trouble —animals are very quick to tumble
to a trainer who is not himself. The man
pleaded hard to be allowed to go on, but
the boss stood firm. That night when all
lights were out and the proprietor was mov-
ing off he happened to glance into a big
lion den, and there tangled up with the
king of beasts was the trainer, asleep. The
late Jack Graham assured Tom Fitzgerald
that he could wrestle with a lion, and he
gave it a go. The hard-shelled athlete was
darned glad to have the assistance of the
cage-men armed with forks and fire. John
never repeated the experiment. Consider-
ing the number of lion and tiger acts that
are presented, and considering that the
beasts between acts have to be attended to
by cage-men. very few accidents happen.
And it is only once in a blue moon that a
member of the public gets into trouble with
the animals of a circus. Of the damage
done to performers and the circus staff, the
elephant has much more to answer for than
any other beast.
‘Dido”: D’Auber, as you will remember,
was killed early in the 4th act of “The
Verger’s Vengeance,” but on this Saturday
night lie had appealed to the management
to permit of his demise at the same stage
in Act 3, which would not disconnect the
drama and would permit of D’Auber join-
ing a week-end party leaving town by a
certain train. So D’Auber was ruthlessly
slain in Act 3. But the heavy villain, having
availed himself of the hospitality of his
numerous admirers during the afternoon,
and secreted a bottle in his dressing-room to
keep it working, forgot all about the change,
and when it came to the crucial moment in
Act_ 4 he started slaying D’Auber all over
again in the absence of the victim. He
wqs slashing about with his sword-stick,
using. the usual offensive language, when
Jimmie, the stage-manager, his head well
m view of the stalls, yelled: “Shut up, you
d—d fool, he’s been dead an hour!” The
old actor pulled himself together. “Dead
an hour,” he moaned —“only an hour, and
his ghost is at me already!” Then he went
on with the play.
“Billy T.”: The heroine, a very well-
known Australian actress now out of busi-
ness, was the bedraggled but innocent
mother wandering with her sick child. The
property man provided wind and snow; the
orchestra tore out a harrowing strain ; and
the actress herself wept noisily in her
anguish. “Dead, dead!” wailed the stricken
woman—“me leetle «cheeild is dead!” Just
then her foot caught in a rip in the cloth
which made the icy sidewalk, and the actress
narrowly escaped shooting head-first into
the orchestra. As it was, her baby banged
into the big drum. Fortunately it was a
stuffed babe, and did not* damage itself or
anybody else. The play went on. and a
moment of relief came when everybody let
up for a second or two. It was now' that
the hoarse lad in the gallery, a bottle-o
probably, inquired with pathetic interest:
“Here, what about that corpse in the orches-
trer ?”
“Nero”: The farcical comedy “Jane,” on
which the musical play “Baby Bunting” is
founded, has always been a favorite with
touring companies, mainly on account of its
small cast and good “going” properties. In
South Africa I played in it many hundred

Everyone who
patronised the

tion. With an-
other co. which
toured Rhodesia
the year before the
Boer War started,
we compressed the
pibce into two acts,

people and called
it “Charley’s

doubled the juve-

the guardian Ker-

supposed to meet
on the stairs “off”
in the first act, and
during a short con-
versation Charley doffed his moustache and
donned Kershaw’s grey wig and whiskers,
these proceedings being reversed at the end
of the play. It was a strenuous night.
“Topo”: It is more than half a century
since Tom Thumb visited Australia (B.
23/12/’2O). I can recall my parents taking
me to a country hall to see the General and
Mrs. Tom (the.first) and Minnie Warren —
quite a fascinating midget. Somebody from
the stage invited all boys under six to
“step up and kiss Miss Warren,” and a
protesting urchin was dragged up the gang-
way but broke loose and hit the breeze
for home. I was that youngster. Heigh-
ho ! It makes me feel young again.
Pavlova, who was a frost in New York
during the war, put up a record there two
months ago, and at the Manhattan Opera
House bagged 50,000 dollars for seven even-
ing performances and a matin€e. Yet her
latest London season, which was admittedly
too long, was not a success. In N’York she
worked on the old lines, and introduced but
one new item, “La Peri.”
“S.T.S.”: Anybody remember Wilson Bar-
rett producing a play called “The Bat” in
Australia? An American drama of that name
by Mary Rhinehart Roberts has reached Lon-
don, only to receive a strong hint that the
title was used by W.B. here. What about
it?
“Stargazer”: Mr. and Mrs. Burford (she
was Nellie Lee) were playing leads with the
Southern Cross Dramatic Co. and had not
been speaking to each other for a fortnight'.
They went on together, acted their parts be-
witchingly, and, coming off, scowled blankly
into each other’s faces and went their several
ways. It was the first night of “Reuben the
Rover,” a melodrama soaked in bathos, and
the lovers had come to Scene 2, Act 3,
where, after many misunderstandings, all
errors are made clear, and he clasps her in
his arms and says: “Dear one, I love you.
In spite of everything I have always loved
you, and only you.” “Oh, Jimmie,” she
answered, and clung about his neck. “Yes,
yes, beloved one, we have made mistakes, we
have mistrusted and affected to scorn each
other, but it had to come to this. You are the
woman of my heart, the sun that lights and
warms my life.” Seven kisses. “Oh, I have
been so foolish,” wailed the heroine. “But I
have suffered because, in spite of seeming, I
just worshipped you.” “Dearest one!” “My
own darling!” Kisses. “Never again.”
Kisseis. “Let me hold you closer.” “Yes,
dear one, closer, closer yet.” Hold pro-
tracted, relieved with kisses. And then the
hoarse voice of Lawrence, the stage-manager :
“Ah-h, come out of that. The blarsted cur-
tain’s been down these 10 minutes.” The
Burfords were reconciled.
“Topo”: Rev. Charles Clarke, R. S.
Smythe’s “Prince of Lecturers,” had a mouth
which it was impossible to fit perfectly with
teeth, so the dentists of those days said.
But fortunately he was a man of resource
and complete presence of mind. In the
middle of “The Tower of London” in Mel-
bourne his unfortunate grinders fell on the
table and bounced. Whisking a handkerchief
over the set, he raised the cambric, wiped
his mouth gracefully, and without turning a
hair said with a smile, “After that slight
digression we shall proceed.” He deserved the
enormous popularity he had.

“The American people are not brighter than
Australians, only brisker.” —Remarks oj an imported
actress.
They run about and up and down
And talk with vigor through their noses,
While we in summer dreamings drown
Our souls in ocean foam and roses.
With zeal they rush to “do it now,”
Though what they do is hard to measure,
While we, as placid as a cow,
Browse on within the fields of pleasure.
(Forget the little war that came
And how we sat about and waited,
While through the thunder and the flame
The points were all United Stated.)
They run about and we sit still.
What wonder that a girl should say it
When we import a Yankee thrill
And bring along herself to play it?

The Pellew-Gregory partnership in the
second Test at Melbourne resulted in the finest
bit of run-getting seen on that ground for years.
In the hour and a half before lunch- they put on
over a hundred runs, and their confident handling
of the bowling, which certainly had lost snap
and sting, was a revelation to mt*iy who later saw'
first-class men like Hobbs and Ilendren patting care-
fully at Armstrong and Kelleway. Pellew’s and
Gregory’s running was in utter defiance of the climb-
ing thermometer. The • long leaps of Gregory and
the sprint of Pellew (he is alleged to do 100yds.
in lOsec.) were brilliant to watch; in one instance
Pellew got five, all run. The applause aroused by
the unexpected stand affected 36,000 people with
incredible perspiration. One fat man in the pavilion
who had been applauding every hit had, like some
of his neighbors, torn off his coat and vest, and
with the moisture coming through with every yell,
he bleated plaintively: “If one of those fellow's
doesn’t get out presently I shall need another shirt.”
England’s express, Howell, was very much over-
bowled, but kept up his pace wonderfully—often,
by the way, at the sacrifice of direction. The others,
with the exception of Douglas—who spared himself,
for a wonder —and Rhodes, who is given few chances
with the ball nowadays, were not dangerous. Wool-
ley had to be kept on over-long owing to Hearne’s
absence, and was not seen at his best when bowling
at Gregory.
Rhodes opened with Hobbs for England, but he
is not the Rhodes of old, and Makepeace got in front
of Armstrong and had to go. Hendren, with a stiff
hold on his bat, played the barn-door, and with
the exception of Hobbs (122), who is miles above
the other English batsmen, was the only player
to look like getting runs.
Gregory and Armstrong got the wickets, the
former taking seven —only two clean bowled. He
made the ball fly at times, and was used very judi-
ciously. Mailey rested. The soft wicket was against
spectacular batting in the Englishmen’s follow-on
innings (they could only make 251 in response to
Australia’s 499), and the first five wickets went
cheaply. Russell again failed to reproduce his
English form. On Tuesday the remaining four
wickets (Hearne didn’t bat in either innings) vvere
soon disposed of, and England lost by an innings
and 91 runs.
* * * *
N. piled up 506 against Queens-
land on New Year’s Day, most of the batsmen shap-
ing well. Asher, however, as often happens with
him, chucked his wicket away, and Ratcliffe’s get-
rich-quick methods of scoring hardly warrant him
being put in first, when the bowling is on the spot.
Punch, who has had a very rough spin from the
State selectors, seemed to play without heart. With
only two hours to go on Monday the Bananalanders
decided to get into the bowling, and Sheppard, the
Northern crack, hit it hard and often. He made it
very obvious that the home team was practically
without bowlers. But rain caused the abandonment
of the match.
■*■***
Arthur Mailey’s 12 for 196 v. Victoria last
week w'as the biggest harvest in inter-State cricket
for many years. Also it brought his tally in Shef-
field Shield matches this year to 20 for 281 runs;
average, 14.05. Mailey’s effort is made more con-
spicuous by the fact that six other bowlers tried
took only seven wickets for 388 between them. E.
A. McDonald (Vic.) has the next-best match his-
tory this year with nine for 173 v. South Aus.
Altogether in big cricket this year Mailey has taken
33 wickets for 650 runs. His best match effort was
14 for 96 for Balmain v. North Sydney in 1915, and
in that season (the first of the eight-ball over) he
put up the record of 102 wickets at 14.04. He also
took most wickets in Sydney premiership cricket in
1917-8 (78 at 18.05) and 1918-9 (66 at 19.01).
Governor Weigall lias clinched his hold
on Adelaide sportsmen by carrying through a cricket
fixture with Tattersall’s Club regardless of the
/act that the thermometer suddenly soared to over
109 deg. The clear heat of S. Aus. makes this figure
not dangerous, though it may be uncomfortable, and
nobody was disabled except McCarron, lately man-
ager of the inter-State team, who was knocked out
■by a ball on the head when batting. The Governor
made 21, and took one wicket —J. H. Pellew, the
old inter-State man. Clem Hill and Legh Winser
do most of the bowling for Government House, and
Walter Duncan, M.L.C., is a leading batsman for it.
The Tatt.’s side was captained by Chairman “Para-
too” McLachlan, whose horses have been winning a
lot lately.
Wilfred Rhodes—the patriarch of the
English XI. aged 43—has done his share in Test
matches. Before the Melbourne match started he
had made 1397 runs, averaging 32.48, and taken 97
wickets at an average cost of 23.28. Another three
wickets and he will be the first Englishman to get
the double. George Giffen and M. A. Noble are
the only Australians who have the honor. Rhodes
was in Australia with the 1903-04, 1907-08, and
1911-i2 teams; and his 15 for 124 on the first trip
is the best bag of wickets in a Test.
Although N. S. Wales led Victoria by 02
on the first innings, the advantage would have been
all needed but for the fine 118 (out 'of 235) made by
Johnny Taylor in the
second hits. Taylor
batted ably all round
the wicket, and played
one of the greatest
innings the Melbourne
ground has seen.
Bardsley (41) and
Bogle (28) also did
their bit, but the
other six couldn’t get'
double figures. With
Gregory on the
damaged list Vic. had
every chance on the
good wicket with only
300 to get; but the
batsmen went in for
tip-catch and were
caught out for 198.
Except two runs-out
and one l.b.w. all the
others were taken in
the air.

With the addition of Cetigne and Prince
Viridis, and minus Braille, the field for Tattersall’s
Cup on Saturday was practically the same as ran
a week before in the A.J.C. Summer Cup. On
the principle that a stayer in good condition is
the most likely horse to win a distance race, this
second cup looked like going to Sam Hordern by
the agency of Arch Marella, who had run second
to Braille a week previously. Most punters held,
however, that Cetigne was a good thing, and the
hardy old battler was backed hard at as short a
price as 4 to 1. In the running all the proved
stayers performed rottenly. Millieme pulled up in
a state of collapse, Prince Viridis ambled in bleed-
ing copiously from the nostrils. Arch Marella never
at any stage looked a winner, and Cetigne Was
unenthusiastic about the proceedings all through.
Fluency, winner of the Villiers, and Golden Slip-
per’s unreliable son, Golden Bronze, had it all to
themselves; and Fluency, clearing out opposite the
Leger, ran on an untroubled winner with the
broadly-smiling Tommy O’Bryan aboard. The smile
was due to the fact that he was bringing off one
of the big doubles of the year. Booth had ■ the
mare in great buckle. Though there is nothing
about her appearance to imply that she will do
anything conspicuous under the weights she will
get in future, she certainly galloped in both events
with rare vim.
Realising early in the spring that Glen-
acre would never make a Derby colt, Fred Williams
set about developing him as a sprinter, and last
week saw him gallop in an easy winner of Tatter-
sail’s Carrington Stakes, a 6-furlong £lOOO event.
Williams, who turned out Salitros for the A.J.C.
Derby and Greenstead for the Epsom, was very con-
fident that Glenacre would not be stopped by Bst.
41b.. and his conviction extended to some very big
bettors. Opening at B’s the colt was backed for
practically all the money the Ring would lay down to
3’s. Last year’s winner of the Carrington, Ready
Aye Ready (9st. 41b.), also carried a fortune, a
circumstance which encouraged the fielders to lay
Glenacre. There was a good deal of money in addi-
tion for Galtee Maid, Wish Wynne, King’s Word and
Beauford. Drawing No. 6 marble Glenacre hopped
quickly off and was never worse than third to the
turn ; and when Galtee Maid blew out below the dis-
tance Killorn had an easy ride home. The Syce
mare Maltgilla, from Booth’s establishment at
Rosehill, came from a long way back, with Bracken,
over the last furlong, and was an ineffective second.
Beauford, one of the most dangerous horses over
short courses now training in N. S. Wales, staggered
in third, after an adventurous journey/ The race
was nearly over before he disentangled himself from
the push. Glenacre ran the six in “12J.” One of
his owners is the lucky person who owns Salitros and
has a half-share in Carlita’s smart daughter, Linita.
* * * *
The Standish and Bagot at Flemington on
New Year’s Day will buy Moses another Rolls-Royce
or two. The only favorite to get home was in ithe
Steeple: Berribee never found the opposition any
trouble, and caught the judge’s eye seven lengths
ahead of the rest. Blue Cross again annexed the
Standish with Bst. 101 b. up, 71b. more than last
year, and though a pile of coin went on the Linacre
gelding, he was only third in the betting to Lisna-
vane and Sir Ibex. British Arch was reckoned a
good thing in the Hurdle, but he mostly had a
distant view of Stagefright s hindquarters and never
got a place. Stagefright, priced at 9 to 2, headed
the trailing procession to the post. Amazonia, a
12 to 1 chance and a descendant of St. Alwyne and
The Amazon, won the Bagot. in good style after
leading for about half the race. Stare, who ran
second to River Star at Caulfield last Saturday, was
favorite at 9 to 2 for the Criterion Handicap, whilst
River Star, who was comparatively despised at
12 to 1. got the verdict by three-quarters of a
length. Neipe, mounted by F. Dempsey, led in the
January Welter, but brought only 4 to 1 to the
punters that loved him.
Although no trains ran in Westralia on
New Year’s Day and the nearest tramway is four
miles from the course, 12,000 people saw the ex-
Victorian steed Seigneur (14 to 1) win the Perth
Cup from the 50 to 1 chance Earl of Seafield, and
the improving Jolly Cosy (10 to 1), which had
beaten Bobaris in a seven-furlong w.f.a. race on the
second day of the meeting. Seigneur is by Comedy
King—Our Queen, and carried 6st. 81b. The much-
travelled Seabound (backed to win a king’s ransom
in l’ershore’s Metropolitan) was one of the favor-
ites, but ran miserably, and although Skysail won
a small race for him, Scobie’s trip across the Bight
was highly unprofitable. With one exception, the
Karrakatta Plate, which went to the odds-on two-
year-old crack Easingwold, the principal events of
the meeting were won by outsiders. Fluent (16’s)
took the Derby, Seigneur (14’s) the Cup, Androni-
cus (16’s) the Railway Stakes, and Palisade (12’s)
the Imperial Stakes. But, true to his custom,
McShortodds will doubtless declare that he “just
broke even on the meetin’.”

On the third day of the Auckland (M.L.)
Summer Meeting, the Demosthenes colt Gasbag won
the Great Northern Derby, and the same owner’s
Finland colt Landbird was separated by Greenwood’s
Vespucci. Another of the Demosthenes clan, the
Equitas mare Oratress, ran second to Tinohoro in the
Club Handicap, and the Midsummer Handicap (for
two-year-olds) resulted in another win for Wilfred
Stead’s Absurd colt Mermin, who is something out
of the common, as again on the fourth day lie got
home in front of Maunu in the Royal Stakes
(w.f.a.), with Greenwood’s Martian —Grand Opera
horse Ilossini third. Gloaming won the Auckland
Plate, and the same owner’s Vespucci ran second,
beating the Great Northern Derby winner, Gasbag.

At Eagle Farm on Saturday the Q.T.O.
continued its Christmas-New Year Meeting. Two
“good things” screamed for recognition-—Glenbern in
the Second Novice and Woodripe in the Eagle Farm
Handicap—but only the latter came off, and with
six lengths to spare. The- Two-year-old Handicap
saw Owissa, a hot favorite, stagger in behind Sera-
zore, to whom she was conceding just on two stone,
but she got the race on a protest. The Midsummer
Handicap was anyone’s race, but with Parmspec, the
Newmarket winner, up only 7lb. against Galas’s
14lb. (the latter was beaten three lengths in the
previous race), it was somewhat surprising for the
Charlemagne 11. horse to practically reverse the
Newmarket finish. The Goodwood Handicap went to
Devona, with a flying start, the favorite, Lord Syce,
being chopped off.

The Speck’s Derby, run by the T.R.C. on
Boxing Day, was won by Thomas Lyons’s Talis-
man, and the time —2min. 9 4-ssec.—was a record
for the race. This is the second Derby to be cap-
tured by the chairman of the T.R.C. At the same
meeting Kermanuka credited him with the Flying
Handicap and Princess Nimy with the Summer Cup.
Skirling (Popingjay—Stave) won the Two-year-old
Handicap in 47 4-ssec., which is a four-furlong record
for the State.

When Norman Brookes announced him-
self for the singles of the Davis Cup, he was either
actuated by sudden disbelief in O’Hara Wood or
was imbued with false hopes in himself by his live-
liness at practice. But a practice game, striking
enough as a revelation of form, doesn’t go the
length of five hard sets which the real battle would
be expected to last between about equally-balanced
players. His great error was in regarding himself
as fit for a five-set game, even after his defeat by
the youthful Peach in Melbourne last month, coupled
with a similar hiding from young Anderson last
year. His only chance against the Americans was
that his placing and eourtcraft might enable him
to snap three straight sets. But the miracle couldn’t
possibly happen against a great hard-hitting pair
like Johnson and Tilden, assuming them to be in
full possession of their faculties. Why Brookes
dropped O’Hara Wood, who was reported to be doing
brilliantly in practice, will seemingly remain a
mystery. Wood, who pushed Patterson very hard
in the final of the singles championship at Mel-
bourne, and could probably run Brookes off his feet
in any singles battle, would have been, on account
of his youth and speed, a more formidable opponent
for Johnson and Tilden. At .least Brookes might
have taken the precaution to practise with Wood
in the doubles, thus saving Patterson an extra game
in a style of play for which he is temperamentally
unfitted. Wood is an excellent doubles player; he
and Thomas won the doubles championship at Wimble-
don in 1919. But Brookes, admirable in the tech-
nique of his calling, was given the expected reminder
of the danger of undue faith in Patterson. Patterson
is not altogether to blame for his ignominous failure.
The conspiracy of glorification by daily paper
“experts,” who are mostly his fellow-players and
friends, has given him an exalted view of his game,
which men of the calibre of Johnson and Tilden soon
proved a hollow illusion. The Americans won easily,
as they deserved to do. If they couldn’t wrench at
least three rubbers from a fading veteran and a
mere showman player, they should chuck up tennis
and spend their leisure at draughts or knitting.
No Australian will begrudge the Yankees their
win. The Cup goes back to the place whence it
came in the hands of the world’s undisputed best
in skill, while in sportsmanship they are surpassed
by none.
Paul Demsky, who is a pure-bred Rus-
sian from Vladivostock, having raised his moral at
the expense of Vince Blackburn in Brisbane, tried
his 17-year-old fist on Andre Dupre at Sydney
Stadium on Saturday night. France went down to
a terrific swipe on the jaw in the first round, but
the enemy’s transport supply was at fault or some-
thing, and reinforcements failed to materialise in
time. On chatting the matter over during the
ensuing armistice with his seconds, the dazed Andre
learned that the manoeuvre which had so nearly
encompassed his ruin was a right cross; and he
made a solemn vow to keep clear of anything of
the sort in future. The resolution made for dul-
ness, and during the remaining 19 rounds neither
side had much to say, though most of the points
went to Demsky, who .specialised on the ribs at close
quarters, but went wide of the target in the open.
Dupre grew more and more weary, and welcomed
his rum issue every three minutes. Drink has a
variety of effects. ' In this case its influence was
benign. By the 20th session the sorely-lambasted
little warrior was dancing joyfully about with flap-
ping wings, inviting the foe to make a real fight
of it; and when Paul got the decision Andre smiled
as. though his fondest wish had been realised. Dupre
is one of the poorest French scientists that have been
■ seen in Sydney since the pioneer contingent arrived
before the war ; on the other hand, he is as tough
as a mule. Demsky, who has scored 14 k.o.’s in
16 wins, should develop eventually into something
considerable. He has great strength, the wooden
imperturbability of his race, a dangerous right cross
and an uppercut which will be murderous once he
learns to aim it in the right direction.

A cable arrived in Australia last week
stating that the Prohibition party in America was
opposed to the Dempsey-Carpentier bout. It is
possible that the Drys are 'moving in the matter.
In Kansas they have stopped cigarette-smoking. On
the other hand, it may be a publicity stunt on the
part of the promoters. The latter have until
February 1 to announce where the contest shall be
held, so, after surmounting the difficulties supposed
to be encountered when arranging every world's
heavyweight championship, they will probably then
let us know that New York, or perhaps Havana, has
been agreed upon, and that the date will be July 4,
1921.

Although nine started in the Aerial Derby
and Handicap at Epsom (Vic.) last week, the real
tussle was between the two big De Haviland machines
piloted by Lieut. R. Parer and Lieut. Briggs. Parer
had with him Serg. J. M. Bennett, the mechanic who
helped the Smiths in their trip from England to
Australia, and the two Diggers, by cleverly getting
a “break” at the start, whirled along to win in
33min 15sec., with Briggs only five seconds away,
and Captain G. Matthews (Sopwith Dove) at the
head of the others. Captain Roy King (200-h.p.
Sopwith Gnu), who was among the starters, had
aboard Mrs. Yule, an intrepid aviatrix who had
intended competing but for her “ ’bus” going wrong.
Captain King’s share of the grist came from winning
the “climbing” competition. The £25 attached to
the Derby Handicap went to Captain Rigby (120-h.p.
F.E.28) from Lieut. Treloar (90-h.p. D.H.6), and
the latter also won the parachute dropping stunt.

N. S. Wales’s defeat of Victoria by 101
runs at Melbourne last week leaves the Sheffield
Shield contest in an interesting stage. Victoria
has won two matches
and lost one; N.S.W.
has won two; S. Aus.
has lost three. N.S.W.
looks certain to defeat
S. Aus. at Adelaide
unless the eight Ma
Staters who are also
playing in the Tests,
are leg-weary. But
with Macartney ill,
Gregory and Mailey in
need of a rest, and
Oldfield with a dam-
aged hand, the N.S.W.
XI is likely to need
reinforcements. Still,
there is plenty of
young blood to call
upon.
OLDFIELD , the
Australian wicket-
keeper in the Tests.
On New Year’s Day Roy Stevens, of
Sydney, confounded those critics who, when he
decided to alter the rig of the ancient Fairfax yacht
Magic from cutter to sloop, shook their heads and
muttered in their beards. At Pittwater (Broken
Bay) Regatta on Saturday, off the 16-minute mark
and over a 164-mile course, he walloped the bowsprit
off Scotia and Bona, with Len Patrick up. Magic
now heads the list of prize-winners among the deep
keelers, with tw T o firsts, two seconds and a third in
six starts. Stan Spain, with Mischief, sailed a good
second to Wanderer, splendidly skippered by E. dale,
whilst Seppv Stevens’s Olive carried off third money
in the General Handicap, for which no less than 16
Sydney Amateur Sailing Club boats nominated.
Bananaland’s representative 16-foot skiffs again
showed their quality in the light breeze which pre-
vailed during the sailing of the morning race at
Birchgrove Regatta on New Year’s Day, when
J.M.H., excellently piloted by N. Wright, showed the
V’ay home to the N.S.W. boat Spindrift (R. Gourley),
with half a minute to spare. Melody • (W. Bergin),
another invader, was third. The nor’-easter freshened
to a hard blow in the afternoon, and the Banana-
landers could fill only third and fourth positions.
J.M.H. (N. Wright) and Memory (V. Lucas), Arlene
(F. Kemp), and Valete (H. Price), N.S.W., were
first and second respectively. Ex-champion Irex
(22ft.) maintained her place as the most successful
boat on Port Jackson this season,, by lifting first
place in the All Boats Handicap during the fore-
noon, and finishing third in the Sme event con-
tested during the afternoon.
Port Adelaide’s Christmas race meeting,
steadily increasing in importance, saw the w.f.a.
and the Cup both won by Paratoo, owned by H. P.
McLachlan, chairman of Tattersall’s Club, and
named after his station, where the horse was bred.
The Cup field was a good one, including winners of
every other local Cup and the Derby. Paratoo was
just beaten in the Port Cup last year, and has since
won the Autumn Handicap at Flemington. This
time he carried Bst. 21b., started a warm favorite,
and won by three lengths after a bad passage.
Dividend £3 13s. All the others were badly left
by the unthought-of Seamada, which paid £23 for
second. The club had £65,000 through the tote,
nearly half as much again as its previous best.
HIS LUCK.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“It has been proposed by members of the Mel-
bourne Cricket Club to send special constables
among Test-match crowds in order to stop barrack-
ing.”
“I’ve led an adventurous sort of a life.’
Thus Bails (L.8.W.) mused.
“You have!” cried his rather too-credulous wife;
"No risk have you ever refused.”
“That steeplechase win 1 brought off on Dead Meat —
Half-way he could hardly contrive
To stand up at all, being utterly beat,
And yet I came through it alive.
“You know that in Africa, not so long since,
I fearlessly tackled big game.
The natives, from Kaffir and coolie to prince,
Untiringly sounded my fame.
They called me with sycophant capers and howls
‘Big-Bloke-witli-the-Oourage-of-Five.’
I used to kill man-eating tigers like fowls—
And yet 1 came through it alive.
“In Flanders I frequently earned the V.C. —
Though, oddly enough, what I did
From those in authority happened to be
By malice or carelessness hid.
I hurried with bayonet, pistol and bomb
Where Huns lurked like bees in a hive,
And put them to flight with the utmost aplomb—
And yet I came through it alive.
“I never felt fear till I played in a Test,
And saw what occurred on the Hill.
It shattered my nerve; it destroyed all my zest;
It banished my world-renowned skill.
While critical comments like rifle-shots flew,
I lost both my cut and my drive.
Just how I achieved it my pals never knew—
And yet I came through it alive.”

Whence comes
all that is exclusive
One effect of the marine stewards’ strike
is to deprive Hobart of the Science Congress.
Melbourne has been chosen as a substitute,
but the hearts of the delegates are sore.
What sort of a background is Carlton, be-
yond the Uni., compared with Mount Welling-
ton ! A beginning is to be made on January
10. Dr. Georgina Sweet, the Vic. secretary,
and some women Uni. grads who have been
pressed into service by her are having a
ding-dong time making hurried arrangements.
Won’t poor old Hobart squirm as it reads of
how Melbourne thrilled as it heard all about
“The Constitution of the Atom,” and “The
Romance of Ice”!
The first Aerial Derby was flown from
Epsom.on Boxing Day—three laps to Frank-
ston pier and back, with wireless messages
dripping in all the time, and an agitated
young man in white flannels chalking the
scores on a blackboard near the judge’s box.
The Aero Club will have to hold its head
hard and think out some knotty points. A
horse-race course does not fill the bill for
an aeroplane race. There is the “gate” to
be considered. Though thousands went to
Epsom and planked down their grandstand
tickets, there were far more thousands who
saw the race from the outside, including
crowds who sat in their cars and merely
smiled at the ticket box. Grandstand
patrons certainly had a seat out of the grill-
ing sun and a fine view of the start. They
had, however, to climb down to the lawn
and do exhausting neck exercise in order
to watch the race. Gazing straight up into
a blazing, cloudless sky may be interesting
to eagles, but it palls on the leisured Aus-
tralian. After the neck-cricking business
oh the lawn the nervous members bolted for
sanctuary on the stand during the finish. It
came in dribs and drabs: some of the 'also-
rans didn’t flop in until long after all the
interest had gone.
The start was exciting—a row of great
bird-things snorting and burr-rr-ing off into
the sky, flicking tail feathers in the faces
of the grandstanders. They rose evenly and
steadily, then whirled round oijt of sight over
the back of the stand. Some of the homing
’planes cracked and roared and spluttered
just over the stand in their descent. There
were no accidents. The inner racecourse
was kept severely clear of crowds. Only a
few stewards fussed arqnnd the ’planes,
though one or two much-befrilled girls in
summer frocks had evidently extra-special
parade privileges.
The roar of the bookie was not heard in
the land ; and in spite of a ripping jazz band
that silence could be felt.
Lloyd George is credited with spending
Christmas Day at Downing-street trying to
straighten out labor and other troubles. We
take things much more philosophically. Pre-
mier Lawson came down to town for the
first time since the holidays last Thursday.
After spending a few hours at his office
he told the public that a serious coal crisis
was imminent which warranted all sorts of
restrictions, including the turning of a
heuseholder into a lawbreaker if the gas
were used to make a cup of tea before or
after the scheduled times. Then he was
whirled back to Castlemaine, which, being
'on a main line, will hardly miss the trains
that have been cut off by the score. Is it
wonderful that the crop of cynics is getting
prolific ?
The expected K.B. came to the State
Speaker; and John Emanuel Mackey's at-
tractive wife will relish it more than her
husband, who would willingly be a recluse.
The lady is a sister of lawyer Bates, who
used to be in the Gillott and Croker firm
and is now a director of Robert Reid’s —lie
married a Miss R_eid. She has done a good
deal in amateur theatricals, and if she hadn’t
had a brainy husband to push to the front
would have made a name on her own
account.
Until the week-end, when even the heavens
wept, Melbourne had shot back to its bad old
habit of brick-kiln winds and a heat that does
not let up on its enthusiasm for weeks. The
iceman has been the sorriest creature on
God's earth, and anyone who wished him a
merry Christmas he felled with one blow of
an ice block. He has been finishing his sub-
urban rounds towards midnight, and his
cry of “Ice!” has been like the wail of a lost
soul. Grimed with sweat and agony and
dust, one spoke of his woes. “Ice—my
Gawd! We hauled two thousand six
hun’red tons yesterday.” A silent offering
of lager went down with a heavenly sigh.
“Right-o. missus ; I won’t forget yer—we’re
workin’ Noo Year’s Day.”
Now rain and rain and more rain!
In the enlarged Waranga Basin, which
is about to be drawn from for the
first time, 260,000 acre feet of water
is stored, or 60,000 acre feet more
than the old reservoir would hold. The
Goulbourn Weir has as much as it can
hold, and the north-west lake storages, the
two Coliban reservoirs, and the Fyke’s
Creek-Melton dam are all brimming. Water
supplies for 1921 are, therefore, assured, no
matter what else we may have to go short of.
If the vice-regal Forsters’ good-looking
daughter, Mrs. Pitt-Rivers, had been born
less heavily gilded she might have won fame
and fortune as a music-hall artist. Her line
would have been mimicry: she can take you
through London, and give you the changing
Cockney accent as she goes.
Breathless rumor declares that the Toorak
Adams’s naval son Brian, now in India, lias
booked for a wedding with the only daughter
of the Earl of Dalhousie. The eldest Adams
son, George, is to marry the lawyer-knight
Mitchell’s chick, Nancy, in March next.
In Perth recently, Fay, the pretty and
petite daughter of Sid Yeo, the mining
investor, who is as well known in Melbourne
as -in the West, became Mrs. Dudley North.
Dudley is a descendant of the North who
helped George 111. to lose the American
colonies; his pa used to be the late John
Forrest’s private sec., and married Dame
Forrest’s sister. The young man served in
the war with a British regiment.
Pianist Cahill mixes business with music.
He is off to the Bananaland home-farm to

“pines” are cut, the musician will set out

Melba McCallum has said “Yes” to Roy
Powers, and there is a great fuss of con-
gratulation, Roy is the son of Justice
Powers. He is a returned artillery man
who suffered for two years from shell-shock,
and is only just back from a restful sea-
voyage. Melba is the daughter of Robert
McCallum, of Bryniston, St. Ivilda.
Mary Anderson, daughter of Eugenie
Duggan, is on the boards, too. The young-
ster has just finished a tour of the Apple
Island.
Dick Stewart’s daughter, who is in the
bright cast of “The Boy,” has saucy good
looks that are a reminder of Auntie Nell.
There is some talk of the youngster playing
“Sweet Nell of Old Drury” under the severe
coaching of the still sweeter Nell. That
Nell is an artist in stage management, and
often took a hand behind the scenes without
any fuss or advertisement. She has a per-
fect touch in the direction of make-up. Per-
haps her toughest job in that way was dur-
ing an exciting and turbulent German
opera season: things were so bad that at last
she got behind the scenes and recreated the
dress even of the large principals. She
scrapped the fuzzy wigs for a start, and
gently groomed the heads of principals, chorus,
supers and all. Then she climbed into the
manager’s box, and looked like a radiant
girl in her ’teens.
Off to America and elsewhere on a six
months’ trip, Dr. Morris Miller, of the Tas-
manian University. He goes with Govern-
ment authority to study the latest things in
psychological training, with a view to help-
ing officially, later on, in the administration
of Tasmania’s newly-born department for
the care and control of mental deficients.
Probably the only link with the Royal
Italian Opera Co. presented at the old Mel-
bourne Opera House by Lyster in the
’seventies is Margherita Venosta, the con-
tralto of the company, who is living in a
suburb of Christchurch (M.L.). The bright
little old lady is still teaching singing, and
is wonderfully vivacious. Her hobby is
cats. For that opera season Alberto Zelman
was in the chair, and Leon Caron, solo
violinist, was leader of the orchestra. It
was then that Caron made his first appear-
ance as. a virtuoso by playing between the
acts. His old press-book reveals columns of
praise frofii the critics of the time. Venosto
made' a hit in “Trovatore” and “Ruy Bias,”
an opera which has not been played in Aus-
tralia since. During the absence of Maggie
Moore from the cast of “Pirates of Pen-
zance” and “Pinafore,” J.C.W. induced Ven-
osta to fill the roles of Ruth and Buttercup
respectively, and taught her the English
himself. She was educated in a convent at
Milan, and played with Mario, the greatest
of all Italian tenors. But she will tell you
that he had no soul and never lost himself
in a part like a true artist should. On one
occasion, while playing at Milan, he stooped
to pick up a p_in which was lying on the
stage during the singing of an aria. After
that Venosta, who was in the wings, was
quite convinced that he never got inside his
part. The interesting little lady is a great
admirer of Caruso, and has a large photo
of the tenor hanging on the wall close to
her piano. She still retains some of the
quality of her popular contralto.
The descendants of Victoria’s first baronet
are doing their share in populating the
continent. Daughter Vera Landale landed
back after the war with a couple of English-
born babes added to her family score; a few
weeks ago Frank Clarke’s nursery was re-
inforced by a son; then came Baronet
Rupert’s further offspring; and the family
birth-records for 1920 were completed when
Father Christmas handed out a baby-sister
for Mrs. Ivy Knox Clarke’s two little sons
to play with.
There are Australians who can’t be happy
unless they are see-sawing on the equator.
Amongst the early 1921 trippers are the
Hunter Dandale widow and daughter Joyce,
the Hunter Landale son and heir and his
bride (Jean Fairbairn) ; also Mrs. Pursey
Chirnside and her flapper chick.
Major-General Legge is down from Dun-
troon, where he is absorbed in turning
schoolboys into officers for the permanent
forces. There are 10 professors on the staff,
besides casual instructors. These men and
their wives live in the school colony, and
their homes make social life for the boys.
The General himself has groups of them
at the “big house” in the evenings for re-
laxation. A pianola is installed and there
is music and a sing-.song. He has even had
Verbrugghen and his orchestra down to
encourage musical tastes. He believes that
it is to the officers’ advantage to be a success
socially as well as militarily. So the young-
sters dance and are not allowed to shirk this
any more than the “physical jerks” or the
cross-country running drill. The profs’,
wives bring along gjrls from neighboring
country homes, They sometimes get even
enough girl-partners to go round.
E. M. Webb, of the Melbourne Age, has
thus far nroduced nine novels. The last
sto r y, “Runaway
Joe,” was taken by
Hodder and Stough-
ton, and a new one,
“The Hatter,” is
calculated to set the
same firm panting
for more. A previ-
ous tale, “Yellow
S i 1 v e r,” was' pub-
lished by the N.S.W.
Bookstall Co. and
added a little more
plumage to his well-
feathered hat. This
tall Australian, who
is the son of the late
Canon Webb, o f
Adelaide, battled in
Westralia for six
years before turning
to the pen. His first press job was on the
Adelaide Critic, then lie joined the Hobart
Daily Post, subsequently returning to the
Herald in his native Adelaide. This billet
he left to look after the Independent Cable
Assoc, at Vancouver, and after a couple of
years at that he filled a hole on the Age
staff. Webb is still in the thirties, and his
narrative gift promises to make him an
early Best Seller.
The heart of Allandale (Alec Peacock’s
electorate) was wrung the other day when
the news sped forth that Mrs. Pat Ryan, a
widow of four-score years, had been found
dead in the bush. She had heard that her old
home at Allandale was to be sold, and, de-
siring to have a last peep at it, stole away
from the house of her son-in-law, T. Cushing,
a Creswick councillor, to walk the four miles.
She got on the wrong track, and unable to
battle against the great heat sank down at
a clump of wattles. While search parties
beat the forest a lad who wasn’t looking for
anything in particular nearly stumbled over
the body. Allandale dropped a tear and
assembled in force at the funeral.
Nobody looks so ornate in “Chu Chin
Chow” as the gorgeous name character with
robes of red. gold, green and blue, cascading
into more delicate tints as they reach his
feet. He has a- marvellous hat, suggesting
hatpins sticking in a pudding, whilst his
warriors are almost shut off from the world
in neck-high garments of yellow and drab,
with saucepan-lid hats making deep veran-
dahs for their features. Charles Workman,
’as Ali Baba, gets his chance to swank when
he has burgled the Magic Cave, and
Charles’s ideas of a fat Arabian exquisite
amount to baggy scarlet garments that talk
loudly and have gold spots for punctuation.
Vera Pearce in her desert raiment with a
long cerise train hanging from a bodice of
yellow, striped with pale and navy blue, is
brilliant enough to make a young camel tear
affrightedly home to mother. Winifred
O'Connor sings in dazzling raiment. One
dress is of deep orange, with arm-hangings
of transparent silver material. Even Maggie
Moore in her one appearance in the Slave
Market is a waddling El Dorado, and the
stout cullud lady who languidly wolfs a
banana on the roof-top while the rest of the
populace is toiling below has a wardrobe in-
spired by a bruised sunset and the Mint.
News from Winnipeg, Canada, has travelled
round the world to say that Charles Clifton
Chataway, brother of T.D.C., of Toorak,
formerly Senator from Queensland, was killed
instantaneously in a lift. Charles was not so
long ago being boomed in the baekblocks of
Canada as one of the makers of the Empire
—surveyor, engineer and so forth. He leaves
a widow, a son who saw service in the war
and younger members of the much-scattered
Chataway family. There is another brother
Chataway in the Canadian baekblocks, also
one in Rhodesia and a sister in South Africa.
The new servant in the home of a Mel-
bourne civil-engineer was getting 275. Gd.
a week, and regarded herself as in the
professional class. Her airs had the mistress
paralysed half the time, but you know how
it is with servants these days—you bear the
ills you have rather than fly to others that
you know not of. But Matilda took a most
unaccountable objection to the master of the
house. He was sarcastic, Matilda com-
plained, and'if there was anythink she de-
tested it was sarcastics. However, she was
appealed to to bear with the wretched man
who knew no better, and she did for another
week. Then she confronted the mistress.
“I can’t stand the master any longer,” she
said ; ‘‘and, what’s more, I won’t. It comes
to this —you’ll have to choose between us.”
The Tivoli sends round small glasses of
water on trays these dog-days, to offset the
heat and the incense. The feminine part of
the audience that does not go out to see
a man about a bottled megatherium laps up
the liquor with gratitude.
Almost the funniest thing in a modern
panto is the affected modesty of the “pro-
ducer” at curtain-call. He is invariably
dragged out protesting, and proceeds to
deny any responsibility for the ravishing
wonders which have again stunned the
public, insisting in heart-broken tones on
the genius of his well-advertised subordi-
nates. At Melbourne Majesty’s this year
the old farce was repeated, with attempts
at bashful confusion by certain assistants
who had long forgotten the art of blushing.
At the King’s Wilmer Bentley, the Yankee
expert, rushed stage-manager Nightingale
into view and proceeded to bombard that
dishevelled young man with superlatives".
If Bentley’s tale was true, Nightingale ought
to be receiving £lOOO a week. Yet, some-
how, all this didn’t set either theatre ablaze.
Now, if the managements had wanted to
really lift the roofs off, they should have
publicly thanked the hardworking chorus
and ballets, whose graceful, lissome beauty
hits every eye.
Who said the unfair sex lacked the busi-
ness instinct? Early in the Great War a
young matron moving in the best-frocked
circles invited pals to swap gold for bank-
notes, playfully saying she was collecting
sovereigns and ten-shilling pieces as a
hobby. Now that her friends who innocently
parted with their gold pieces have learned
to properly appreciate the ever-increasing
difference in value between a pound-note and
a sovereign, they smile acidly.
From Adelaide in a cool spell:—
Adelaide Art Gallery, which has long been re-
proached with having no battle picture, has bought
H. S. Power’s “Villers Bretonneux,” and it is now
on the water. Power is mainly an animal painter,
as he was when he lived in Adelaide, and has made
a team of Artillery horses a leading, feature of the
picture. Meanwhile the news comes that the much-
discussed “Sowing New Seed” has got back to the
hands of Orpen, its painter, and he is now complet-
ing his promised portrait of Marshal Foch to be
sent to Adelaide in exchange.
South Aus., keeping its 84th birthday at Glenelg,
first made pilgrimage to the historic gum-tree, and
then feasted the pioneers in the Town Hall, with
more oratory than they needed. The roll-call was
signed by two old ladies who claim that as infants
they came in H.M.S. Buffalo with Hindmarsh, but
there were about 40 who arrived, either by ship or
native-born, 80 years ago or more. F. B. Oldham,
who has responded to the Pioneers’ toast of late, has
died since the last occasion, and E. J. Haddrick (of
the Resource, 1839) now has the honor.
Mayor Moulden gave an afternoon reception to the
Press on Christmas Eve. Pleasant things were said
about the host and his energetic wife —who in her
former experience as the wife of Hackett of Perth
knew all about pressmen—by Harold Taylor, presi-
dent of the A.J.A.; Burns, of the Register ; Berry
Smith, of the Advertiser ; Birrell, of the Herald,
and Horace Yelland, of ttre Mail.
The indefatigable Eslimc opened his new palais de
dance at Glenelg last week —a coolly built place
that claims to give dancing space for 600 couples,
and will blossom out into a cafe, open-air garden,
and all sorts of delights by the time the final dab
of gilding is added to its paint. It is to be go-as-
you-please as regards clothes: anything from swallow-
tails to shirt sleeves, as long as your personal
behavior is beyond reproach.
There have been Christmas sprees galore. One
was for the children of South Australians who served
with British units, with the British Imperial Ser-
vice Club as hosts; another was at the Keswick
Military Hospital—the sixth of the kind arranged
by Mrs. George Bagot, who has made the wounded
her care ever since the first pitiful sliipful came
back. She, by the way, is off to England, and
there wasn’t a man at Friday’s dinner who didn’t
feel lonely at the thought of’ losing her friendship
even for a time.
Died on Friday Mrs. Kaines, who came here in
the Charlotte Jane in ’54 when bullock-drays were
the chief means of getting about. One of her
daughters, now Mrs. Percy Trevor, is a keen amateur
mummer and raised a good many useful pounds for
war work.

A WOMAN’S
LETTER
Scotland came to Sydney once more on
New Year’s Day with a skirl of the pipes and
a toss of the caber and descended on Moore
Park, where there are advertisements for as
many kinds of whisky as even a Scot could
sample between the rising of the sun and
the going down thereof. Tartan was every-
where, and heat wave or not your Scots
mother had dressed Robbie and Elspeth in
their kilt and plaidie, with cairngorm and
buckled slioon. What did it matter if Els-
peth’s nose was burned off her face so long
as she wore a snug Glengarry on her head
and tossed a defiant leg in the Highland
fling? This year the Munro Ferguson was
absent from the feast, but Governor Davidson
did the honors, declaring that he was a Scot
from the North of Ireland (Sir Walter’s
nationality is rather like that of the crashing
aviator who said he went up a Russian but
came down a Pole), and then he let the cat
out of the bag completely by greeting Jarvie
Hood as the first nominee of the Labor
Government for a knighthood. But what
did the pipers and the stone-putters, the
caber-tossers and the dancing girls and boys
care for that as they cheerfully broiled to
prove they were descendants of the “Scots
wha liae wi’ Wallace bled” ! But there was
a tinge of Sassenach weakness in the Roman
charioteer who considered his thinning
thatch, with the sun striking down like a
pitiless sword, and stretching for his black
bowler planted it firmly on his head. In the,
evening the Town Hall held as much of
Caledonia as could squeeze info it for the
annual jamboree of auld Scots songs.
Thank goodness, there’s at last one Adam
who can’t say that Eve tempted him. Jarvie
Hood, the new doctor-knight, is a bachelor.
Adrian Knox, C.J., gets a-» K.C.M.G. in
the New Year’s titles list. His career has
been a steady record of success, and it isn’t
nearly ended yet. He made good at the Bar
as soon as he went there, not by any particu-
larly brilliant efforts, but by those qualities
of solidity which have stuck to him ever
since.
That rising young barrister, Adrian Knox,
Just lately elected by popular vox
sang a Bulletin versifier 30-odd years ago,
the occasion being the C.J.’s first appearance
in the N. S. Wales Assembly. However,
Knox quickly abandoned politics and con-
tinued to rise at the Bar. . He married,
shortly after resigning his seat, a descendant
of Lawson, the explorer. He had always
been interested in racing, and started about
this time as an owner in a small way. When
Colin Stephen married one of his sisters,
Knox and his sporting brother-in-law formed
a sort of casual racing partnership, and owned
one or two-good ones. The C.J. in embryo
was easily the strongest president the A.J.C.
has had or is likely to have. He knew so
much about law and business in addition to
racing that when he had spoken the general
feeling was that there was no more to be
said. ” He has not been quite so assured on
the Bench. The restless, questioning Isaacs,
who was the bane of old Samuel Griffith, is
a continual menace to the peace of mind
of Griffith’s successor also. He was freely
tipped for a baronetcy this year, having all
the qualifications, including the chief one —
wealth. It may come off later.
Of course you’ve been to Randwick and
seen the lawns with their glowing flower-
beds, the stands radiant with multi-colored
silks and muslins; you have seen the crowds
of overfed people, rather thick in the neck
and high-colored in the complexion—the men
mellow with plenty and the women like so
many sleek, purring cats. From the official
or the members’ stand you have seen the
favorite win, or drop behind beaten ; or, if a
personage of the moment, you have sat snug
in the vice-regal pen and approved the win-
ning nag whether he carried your pound or
not. But have you ever wmtched the sharp-
featured gentry from the back streets of
Kensington and Paddington follow the race
from the Flat? Past the pie and the prawns
and the hot-sausage men, sulky and jinker
and bottle-o cart trot in the gates almost as
steadily as the stream of motor-cars drops its
toad outside the saddling-paddock. Before
the first race there’s a rush to get a “possie”
on the rails or at the fence from which the
horses can be watched flying down the
straight and flashing past the judge’s box.
They were as good-natured a crowd as ever
that swarmed to the flat on Boxing Day:—
the mothers and fathers who come with
groups of small kiddies and picnic baskets;
the men who come and lay sprawling on the
grubby-looking grass, half-asleep or reading
through the hot afternoon, not even flickering
an eyelash to the hoarse shout of “They’re
oft'!” Everybody gives you a tip. An ex-
cited late-arrival dashes up to ask what num-
ber Marcinelle is in the next race, Miss, and
snatches the book from you to find it quickly,
telling you while she runs a thick-grimed nail
down the names that “like a fool I was
put off the winner in the last race, Miss!”
Then she whispers “Don’t miss Old Gold —
sure thing!” and tears to one of the windows
of the five bob-tote. A young man with never
a top-tooth in his head hops on to the rails
and clings there with the toes that you guess
are somewhere hidden in the very dirty white
canvas shoes, which, with a recherche open
shirt-front, closing in a V just above the
waist-line, is the last word in Flat summer
fashion. He says: “Don’t let Julia Grey
pass you, Miss; and Finmark’s a dead cert.”
A profiteer at the gateway holds up late-
comers with “last book on the ground—two
bob for it.” “G’on, yer little monkey, I’ll
let your mother know about yer,” scolds a
tiny grey woman in a near-silk jersey, an
umbrella-shaped liolland skirt, and a tight-
fitting bonnet. “Think you was Billy
Hughes’s son, yer little grab-all!”
But underneath all the banter there is the
undertow that draws them all —the hardy
punters of both sexes; the old Syrian in his
light violet suit, his pink and blue striped
silk shirt, his yellow boots and blue hat; the
fleshy youngish woman in the feathered pink
headgear. The end of every race sees the
human flotsam sucked back, always to the
little windows where the five shillings were
exchanged for a scrap of paper, while the god
of chance saT aloft and roared with laughter
till the toothless young man heard the noise,
and called it .a thunderstorm.
It would have takgn a clever Paris to
award the apple at the last day of the
Christmas meeting at liandwick. Beauties,
like the bishops of Gilbert’s rhyme, were
as plentiful as tabby cats. They were all
on view, with Lady Forster extending a
kindly wing over the bunch. By the way,
has it ever struck you that vice-regal appro-
val is like charity V Lady Forster stuck to
her favorite blue dressing, while the local
Governor’s wife swathed herself in cream
lace with violent yellow eruptions. The
YVestralian beauty Lady Dyer was there,
a Diana-like person dressed in soft black
and white satin, and a small hat that cas-
caded into a cock’s plume on her dark hair.
Sheila Loughborough looked like a flapper in
a knee-length dress of white washing satin
and a prim little lace hat. Tall Mrs. Pitt-
Itivers wore yellow organdie; Lady Digby
was in cream georgette; so was the in-
domitable Mrs. Sep Levy, looking more
Greuze-like than ever under a nigger-brown
hat.
There isn’t an artist in Australia who
doesn’t know Gayfield Shaw. Up in his room
in Penzance Chambers he handles their
shows in the gentlest manner in the world;
but for all his sweet
simplicity he has
been turning over to
the artists larger
cheques than they had
ever before realised.
But perhaps the real
reason for the little
man’s success is
that he loves pic-
tures, and as he
can’t paint them
himself he has gone
into the one line of
business where he
will always have the
beauties about him.
Not so many years
back he started sell-
ing magazines and
odd prints and an-
tiques. Occasionally, when something really
fine came his way, he locked the door on the
magazines and took his treasure to the art-
lover in Sydney who would most prize it.
If that art-lover said “Not to-day, thank
you,” Gayfield went on to the next man
on his list. Gradually the art treasures
crowded out the magazines, and now the
best-known artists’ middleman in Australia
has his wall-space booked up for the whole
year.
The holiday season has seen the Seamen’s
Mission aglow : this Christmas pudding was
voted the best any of the sailor men had
tasted—anyhow, since last Christmas. The
little cabin boys found that Liverpool and
London aren’t so very far away from Sydney
town when the distance is bridged by friendly
hands. The big reading-room has been one
of the most “happy Christmas” sights about
town all through the past fortnight.
The little ham-and-beef shop round the
corner is without the usual paper streamers
this festive season: the up-to-date jazz palace
has taken them all. From the floor of
the Wentworth on New Year's Eve the
dancer looked up into a regular jungle of
what seemed like some fantastic tropic over-
growth. Of course there were other things
besides paper streamers: there were fairy
colored lights and joybells and a bon-bon that
stretched from bow to stern of the room.
There were perspiring and struggling masses
of humans trying to dance in the small
clearing ringed about by a mushroom crop of
tables. Young-old men hid their bald
patches under paper caps, and women (some
fairer and some warmer) strung balloons
on to their shoulder braces. There was a
bunch of high society whose youth and inno-
cence bubbled over in a ring-a-rosy before
crescendoing into a jazz. Suburbia per-
spired in the effort to make as much use as
possible of the expiring yearly train ticket.
Mary Grant, from Queensland, won a jazz
competition in black and silver, with one of
the house-agent Stantons for male support.
She couldn’t have done it with her old part-
ner H.R.11. Mrs. Henry Hill Osborne, in pale
primrose satin, and Mrs. (D’Arcy Osborne-
Marks) Colvin sat together and shared the
honors for good looks. Baroness Furnivall
shoved a flower over each ear and carried
a henna fan; little Mrs. Nelson wore a frdck
that looked born in America of Paris extrac-
tion ; and blue-eyed Nurse Quayle’s Grecian
swathing didn’t suggest the six o’clock duty
at the Children’s Hospital that she was in
for. Mrs. Cumberlege brought her Claude
and the Maitland lady brought her Bert;
Miss Cook cast an approving eye over the
merrymakers; the bunny-skin Scandretts
were there and shipping-man John Lane,
with his henchman Armstrong and his missus
in a pink frock that suggested the midnight
Frolics; and the E. J. Taits, Cissie Jamie-
son, Dr. Stuart McKay, Mrs. Herbert Clay-
ton and Mrs. Hugh Gordon were among
those who stood beneath the exploding bon-
bon in the last minutes of 1920 and found
that it contained nothing much more solid
than gold confetti.
Here is Auckland man Shayle Gardner,
who was beginning to make his name as an
actor when the war
broke out. After
three ' attempts to
join up Shayle per-
suaded the authori-
ties that he’d make
a good soldier. Some
months before his
discharge he was
made Director of
Entertainments, and
under his guidance
the Kiwis became
famous. On his re-
turn to London he
played Brutus i n
Henry Ainley’s com-
pany, and he is now
taking part in the
all-star cast of the
“Wandering Jew” at
the New Theatre, London. Shayle is of the
stock of tl» Christchurch Gardners.
Meantime at Farmer’s there had been a
Highland dinner, with Dugald Thomson in
the lead, and a braw piper skirling among
the tables, and laddies and lassies playing
ping-pong between the brose and the haggis
wi’ their fans and their gay toy balloons.
On the opening night of “Welcome
Stranger,” at the Palace, a woman in the
dress-circle caused a mild sensation by pro-
ducing a small hand electric fan. It was a
flashing ivory disc apparently attached to a
batteried stick held in the lady’s hand.
While the other women in the theatre
nearly wore their elbow-joints out, the lady
with the electric air-duster leaned negli-
gently back, and with no effort on her part
a cool stream of air encompassed her. Here’s
a noser for the poet. What about a sonnet
to Julia’s high-voltage electric whizzer?
The engagement that is stirring all the
Sydney families is that of Lucy
Windeyer (she’s the artistic one) to Colonel
Baldwin.
Eileen Cassidy, of Centennial Park, has
accepted the half-hoop that precedes the
plain gold circlet from Newman Marion, of
Lewisham and the Riverina.
What woman who has ever gone to Rand-
wick in the years back can say she didn’t
know Jim Barden? Every woman put her
money on Jimmy Barden and didn’t even
look at the name of the nag he was riding.
Jim is now a trainer at Rad wick, and his
daughter Laurie slipped into double harness
at St. Jude’s Church the other evening with
all the usual trappings and the Rev. Cake-
bread to do the tying. Her partner for life
is Bert Wolfe, known in turf circles as
“Cardigan,” one of Sydney’s best-known
sporting writers. He came from Maitland
and served in the A.I.F. for three years.
Sydney started “community singing,” after
the American plan which Adelaide (-for-
eulture) has adopted, at the last Apollo
Club concert. On the genial conductor’s in-
vitation the audience uprose and the Con-
rafters rang to the final chorus
of the club’s annual offering of “Nazareth.”
’Twas a fine ending to a concert of good
music. There was a newcomer among the
solo vocalists, soprano Ettie Field from
Maoriland —a dainty little person, dark-
haired and dark-eyed, with a voice of beauty
and power.
Richard Haynes, K.C., is one of the
Westralians who got over to Sydney before
" their State was isolated by the shipping and
railway strikes. He is a brother of John
Haynes, who helped to found The Bulletin,
but rnigrated west after the Kimberley rush,
and has been a leader of the Perth Bar. and
its raciest raconteur, for 40 years. When
Andra Fisher was Prime Minister “Dicky”
narrowly escaped being appointed to the
High Court bench. Pugnacious, explosively
eloquent, and disconcertingly quick at seizing
a point, lie ranks high as a cross-examiner
and is a terror to evasive fitnesses. .
Sheila Lady Loughborough insists that
the. first half of her name be pronounced
“Low”; the end part is something between
“burrow” and “borrow.”
There was a service at St. Mark's, Dar-
ling Point, for the passing of Edith Richard-
son. The family in the old days, when it
had its home at the Point, had been great
St. Markians. The church was crowded
and all noted a beautiful wreath hung
beneath the memorial window placed in the
church by the Richardson family. The
wreath had :.been placed there by Mrs.
Flower, whose husband was rector of St.
Mark’s when Edith was just a little girl.
Mrs. W. P. Phipps, daughter of the Artar-
mon Flower who pioneered the export of
frozen meat,' arrived from Java during the
week to spend Christmas as usual with her
children, who are being educated here. This
energetic Sydneyite mothers the British
community at Java. Her latest visitors were
the W. Love pair, who climbed and peered
into volcanoes around Garoet, but a patrol
of military guarded the now-active Merapi, in
the locality of the famous Borobodoer. How-
ever, they all sat on the temple at night and
viewed the awe-inspiring sight of flame and
lava illuminating perhaps the loveliest
valleys on earth. Accompanying Mrs. Phipps
is Mrs. Mitchell, whose husband is the crack
shot of the Batavia rifle club.
Rene Lees is another Australian that hard
luck doesn’t daunt. Rene is an organist, and
some years ago she gave promise of becoming
world-famous. Like the cat in the rhyme she
went up to London, if not exactly to visit
the King, at any rate to play before Edward
VII. Then came neurasthenia and the loss
of all power of her hands for more than two
years. Now she is right again and playing
as well as ever.
There was a dashing young woman aboard
one of the boats that arrived lately, and
in sheer boredom she cast the glad eye with
great persistence at a leading fluff duke who
was also a passenger. The boat’s Mrs.
Malaprop was scandalised. “Thinks she
can get up a flirtation with him, does she!
No fear! He’s quite a Mark Antony !”
A Brisbane postscript:—
Our Excellency spent Christmas at Bellevue as
the guest of Mrs. Lumley Hill. It was a quiet party,
only an aide, the A. 11. Whittinghams, the E. J.
Watts and the Taylor family being there.
A Christmas fete at the Children’s Hospital (with
the Courier's fund serving as Santa Claus) dis-
closed the unpleasant fact that there were then 75
youngsters in the diphtheria ward. Of course there
must be “carriers” ; and if our medical officers don’t
know how to deal with them they ought to send to
Broken Hill and ask about the diphtheria crusade
there —the finest thing of its kind ever done in
Australia.
W. H. G. Marshall, town clerk of this hamlet for
nearly 50 years, died in the Mater Hospital last
week. Born in Brisbane in 1850, he entered the ser-
vice of the city at the age of 15. A. J. Hockings
was mayor then, and Marshall pere was the alderman
representing the Valley ward.- It was when James
Swan wore the uncomfortable rabbit-skins that Mr.
Marshall was made town clerk, at the age of 23.
He was a shy, reserved man, a loyal friend, the
soul of honor, and a most capable officer.
For the races at Ascot hundreds of station people
had flocked in, and pretty girls aired pretty dresses,
to the despair of “social” writers, who groaned in
chorus “Who is she?” unavailingly. Mrs. Jack
Fihelly looked cool and handsome in white organdie,
embroidered in mauve with a wide-brimmed mauve
georgette hat. Two pretty Carruthers girls were
with her. Mrs. Glynn Connolly wore pale pink
organdie, with a turquoise-blue velvet girdle, and
a white hat with cheerful pink ribbons. Mrs.. N.
Willis (she was Winnie Sutton) took the eye in
powder blue georgette and a black hat, and Jean
Love, Mrs. Frank Hall, Mrs. Jack Chandler, Mrs.
George Logan, Mrs. Renton McSwaine and Mrs.
Charlie Buchanan all chose white, with summery-
looking hats that made all the little flower gardens
appear blighted.
But the most alluring toilette was worn by a
gent. His white silk shirt (he’d left his coat at
home) was decollete, and laced down the front
with a black silk cord. Peg-top trouesrs of black
and white check adorned his legs, and were very
tight as to ankle and very balloony as to hips.
Black silk socks and white shoes, a straw hat (often
carried in the left hand) a fan (in the other) and
Marcelled locks completed the toilette. Defeated
jockeys smiled again on beholding him.
In the grateful evening of a thunderous day Violei
Wamsley, eldest daughter _of the Wamsletys oi
Arabella station, was married to solicitor Clem
Ellison. Ivory satin charmeuse, with pink georgette
lining the train, enveloped the bride, and her veil
was of enviable Malines lace. May Walmsley and
Marie Harding bridesmaided, and Arundell Wilson
was best man and Tom Walmsley groomsman.

Young Men
Don’t Get Bald
Cuticura Does Much
To Prevent It .
n
Dandruff, itching, scalp irritation,
etc., point to an unhealthy condition
of the scalp, which leads to thin,
falling hair and premature bald-
ness. Frequent shampoos with
Cuticura Soap and hot water do
much to prevent such a condition,
especially if preceded by a gentle
anointing with Cuticura Ointment to
spots of dandruff and itching.

ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS.
No notice (except of a hostile character) will be
taken of communications insufficiently stamped.
Name and address must appear on the MSS. No
liability is undertaken re contributions volun-
tarily submitted; and no MS. will be returned
unless stamps accompany.
Nell T.: Indicate pars, giving date and
page (it’s best to cut ’em out), post to accountant,
and he’ll do the rest. . . .Hig'hbrow: No doubt; but
\ve want to be read... .M.M.C.: Cast into tne
best substitute we could find for the burning, fiery
furnace.... Momba; Don’t worry about whether you
can write or not. Pitch us a yarn—that's all we
want from the bush....U.T.P.: Come down to earth.
One ought to be able at least to guess what a
poem means, even if everybody doesn’t guess alike.
....Crystal Street: Now, that’s not true. The
unions did ask that Broken Hill paper proprietor
to meet them in conference; but it was only on
certain conditions—that certain writs should be
withdrawn, in other words, while the unions re-
tained the right to use all their weapons, they asked
Davidson to throw away his most powerful one. There
have been too many of these tricky proposals lately. It’s
not Labor’s old, honest, forthright way. And it
was particularly shocking to use it against David-
son, who had as large ideas about welfare work
and so on as any journalist in Australia.
. ...W.F.M.: Right, “MeNorth” "Shall stand cor-
rected. Malay Bay is 40 miles from Pt. Essington,
and his remarks about- oysters refer to the port
and not the bay.... Data: The B.’s original par. was
right and “Ajax” was wrong—Strangways, the ex-
S.A. Premier, has been dead long enough for daisies
to bloom on his grave. .. .J.W. (Clermont): Good
sentiment in verse that ought to be better....
A.A.Ji.: One fact noted: —•
The Dove of Peace, escaping from a modern ark,
Would be sure to pause and dwell in Moseley Park.
. ...R.D.F.: “Fatigue” is not good enough.... H.B.
(Cariingford) : Doesn’t make a yarn.... Herbert M.:
A very slight thing carelessly done. . . . W.G. (Banks-
town): No use for “The Girl Diver”.... Raymond
II.: Rubbish. .. .J.L.N.: You don’t seem to have
any idea of the meaning of metre.... Corporal Dig-
ger: Even if the forecast were correct, you have
made a tame story of it... .R.0.L.: Not enough
there. .. .H.G.C.: The night will bring you dreams.
Well, well,’ that is unusual... .Vic.: It’s all pretty
bad. And some of it sounds like an echo of the
cheaper American stuff... .Walthos: Write it in
some cheap lady’s album. The cheaper the lady
the better.... Fernside: They narrowly miss dis-
tinction as shopking examples.... Bellerive: The
“Jam Factory” has all the necessary appeal:—
To try and earn an honest crust
I was never known to ’shirk ;
Storking plums and apricots
111 the factory was my work.
The pickers had their arguments,
But remained the best of chums,
In the absence of the foreman
Would skylark with the plums;
I was promoted from a picker
To juggle greasy bins,
Assist in stacking eases
And washing juicy tins;
Though humble were my wages,
I drifted on life’s way,
And always had a shillihg
For a concert or a play.
. ...R.K.: Rather dull fooling, and not very original.
. ...L.C.T.: You don’t make anything of it....
Maisie C.: Lame little bit of commonplace.... Jack
E.: “Mary-Rose” is just cheap bleat.... Tem: No
use....Elby: “Plea” and “Elegy” both make us sad.
....Ada R. B.: A yard of crumpled paper rejected
with gladness... .8.F.E.: Not up to the mark....
Edith M.: “A Prayer” is not good enough.... Tom
D.: It’s pretty crude and bumpy, Thomas. .. .Tom
Hope: Not well enough done... .H.G.C.: What in
the name of all the Muses do you mean by “leave the
opiate pall of doubting immolation” ?... .The Reid:
Not up G.E.L.: Old, well-worked idea in very
lumpy verse.. .R.F.S.: Doesn’t strike us....Walad:
Hardly... .H.C.G.: N0....K.A. (Glenferrie) : They
don’t say enough.... Chick S.: The verse is some-
where on the road, but you have a long way to go.
....Fan: “Evening Halt” goes heavily... .H.B.
(Melb.) : Old commonplaces.... Edward M.: You
may have taken a lot of pains with “Science,” but
you’ll need to take a lot more before you write
acceptable verse... .T.P.: “Maria” is a fowl of a
mechanical breed... .Allie S.: Impossible to reply
by letter. Verses have good color, but are rather
short of point and form. . . .A.V.G.: Sorry, can’t
use.. . . A.N.P.: Nothing there. .. .Alice M.: Not
what we are hungry for. .. . J. 8.0.: No use sending
stuff like that.... Regrets: Not enough in it for its
length... .J.H.S.: “Old Bally” is very bad verse....
H. 5.8.: Far too rugged.... Talus: Bad —in fact, hor-
rible.... Surry ’111: “The Squealer” is lumpy and
bumpy and knock-kneed and short of breath. .. .
Ralph B.: Wooden stuff....L.M. (Marsden) : Com-
monplace thought in poor lines. . . .Bernard A.: Dull,
mechanical and without any discefnible purpose....
G.W. (Wongan Hills): No u5e....N.8. (Taihape):
The old “morn-dawn” rhyme again! We would
almost as soon listen to a parched wheelbarrow....
A.J.L.: A good little theme. See if you can’t im-
prove the handling F.J.M.: Not badly done, but
not interesting.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
L.M.8.: Two very simple little heads do not win
in this school... .G.K.: Unappealing trifles....
W.R.M.: Painful daubing.... W.F.: Teach yourself
a lot more and then try again... .C. 8.8.: Thanks,
but the idea is not illustratable in that form....
R.H.McG.: Laborious efforts reminiscent of old
Maori wood-carvings, though the artistically-set little
pub in the distance is a refreshing note... .H.R.:
A very old ’un.
“Omeo’VWhen our Battalion’s hard case
returned to the line from Blighty leave
there was nothing for it but to look sorry
and report sick. “H’m,” said the quack,
“didn’t you take precautions?” “Cert’nly,”
replied William. “I went to a house reserved
for officers.”
“Topo”: “Country Ped” (B. 16/12/’2O)
on juvenile abnormality shows me that the
type hasn’t improved since I was a young
dominie. A girl-teacher in our school had
dealt firmly, but kindly, with an incorrigible
offender of five. That day a large Irish
constable came visiting the class, and out
marched the incorrigible, with blood dripping
from the back of her hand. “Look wot she
doned a me,” she sobbed. The moment the
brat saw the uniform, she had dug her finger-
nails into the flesh and brought blood; re-
membering the morning correction, she
wanted to get even. Before he left Robert
got me in a corner, and gave me this solemn
advice: “All yer loife be careful, me bhoy,
an’ niver be alone wid less than a dozin of
’em, or they’ll hang, dhraw an’ quarther ye.”

FOLLOW A MASTER HAIRDRESSER’S
ADVICE. HE KNOWS WHAT’S GOOD.
You Try a Rexona Shave.
rji
i
•V
Messrs. BUI ST (from a photo).
I have been a master
hairdresser in Sydney for
the past 35 years, and dur-
ing: that time have tried
many shaving- soaps, with
a view of discovering one
suitable for use in my
saloon, and after giving
your Rexona Triangular
Shaving Stick a trial, great
was my surprise to find I
had at last secured a suit-
able soap, one which has
given entire satisfaction.
It lathers excellently, and
softens the beard better
than other soaps I have
used, and at the same time
it leaves the face free from
all irritation.
I have always been a
great advocate for Rexona
Triangular Shaving Stick,
as I realise that it has no
other equal, both for pre-
serving the skin and its
economical value.
Your wonderful Shaving
Stick I will recommend to
my friends and customers,
well knowing that they will
be rewarded after a trial.
Yours truly,
(Sgd.) H. BUIST,
Culwalla Chambers,
Sydney, N.S.W.
Watch for the Triangular Stick.
Rexona Shaving: Stick (Medicated) is Rexona Soap specially treated so as to
produce a thick, creamy lather, which will soften the heard and improve the skin at
the same time.
Rexona Shaving: Soap contains the same soothing: and healing' powers which have
made Rexona the Rapid Healer famous throughout Australia. So, men, if you have a
tender skin, remember Rexona is specially prepared for your needs; it will soothe
your skin, and quickly heal any cut you may have the misfortune to get. Make your
next shave a “Rexona Shave”; you’ll enjoy it.
Rexona Shaving Soap is something entirely new in every respect. Watch for the
triangular enamelled box, for Rexona Shaving Stick is not
round, like the old-fashioned kinds, but triangular, and
packed in a triangular enamelled box, tasty and neat, easy
to hold, and dainty in every respect.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
LONELY, enduring islands of the coast.
Where East Australia looks down
to the sea
Upon her serried billows, host by host,
Storm and artillery.
About their knees the ocean sifts and threshes
Sand, and the seaweed, and the seatlowers
line;
Their hidden feet the swaying current meshes
In the well-heads of brine.
Friendless, enduring in that spume and
smother,
, Bearing without a cry the thunderous blue ;
Lifting tneir heads, brother by silent brother.
Unto the gracious dew.
But when the mad Pacific wins to calm,
And the wild warring crowds of ocean
cease,
There swift returns to them the ease, the
balm,
And all the friends of peace ;
The memories of happy hours that be,
The calm that brings the new cause to be
strong ;
And loneliness gone with the crowded sea
That scarred wi*th spur and thong.
The noise of traffic and the roar of trade ;
The gabble of the market, hard as stone —
These have, to men who think, the cities made
All desolate and lone.
Noise, gabble, gossip, slander, sneer and
shriek,
Cry of the huckster who the useless sells;
Babel of business for all the week,
And then the clanging bells
That call the traders, who for six days cheat,
And pray on Sundays that they may atone;
And thete the men who scorn to cog and bleat
Must ever be alone. -
Not in the forest depths am I alone,
Nor on the plain’s interminable sea ;
For there from dappled leaf and blade are
thrown
The dryad-eyes of thee.
Not where the runnel tinkles through the
moss,
Nor in the bower-bird’s thorny solitude;
Nor where, on empty plains, shines down the,
Cross;
Nor mountains gaunt and rude.
Not by the ocean, nor the river’s rise;
Not on the empty plain, nor by the stream ;
For there companions be, to seeing eyes,
The glamor and the gleam.
For there Romance is held by Memory’s
vision ;
Deeds done so long ago are seen again;
All that was wrong has suffered Time's
elision,
When far withdrawn from men.
The mem’ries' of red roads in country green,
Palms and lush grasses, nights bespilled
with stars;
Great flowering trees, drugged with their
bloom, that lean
Toward the river bars.
A shield of polished steel that is the bay,
Whence blood-red roads lead on to Paradise
Of the green covert, hidden from the way,
Seen only by our eyes.
A garden high and shaded, warm and dim
As the skies pale from daffodil to dark;
A river ribboning its unseen rim,
Girdling the gracious park.
A sandy road through fan-palms to the sea,
And ti-tree from back-water to the ridge;
Flame-trees on grassy bank and swampy lea,
And fishers on the bridge.
Orchids and bracken from the marshes’ edge,
And violets to give the spring her proof;
The showery dawning at the window-ledge,
The rain upon the roof.
The sandstone banks that grew great flaming
flowers
So. slowly that we never saw their blowth,
Only the great buds of them, in those hours
Down in the showery South.
The green old hamlet where the ancient clock
Looks from his eyrie in the ancient tower,
And of the dead —all done with time —makes
mock,
Mistelling every hour.
The lighthouse ray that searched for us, and
found
Xls on the cliffs above the thunderous sea
That plays, in great wave-eaten caves of
sound,
A fine monotony.
Thus brought to us the foes of loneliness,
The memories—that close the door on
gloom—
Of sanctuary, after storm and stress,
In the cool quiet room.
* * * *
Not in the forest depths am I alone,
Nor on the plain’s interminable sea;
For there, from dappled leaf and blade, are
thrown
The dryad-eyes of thee.
QUEENSLAND.

“Felo-de-se.”
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THE scream of the midday whistles was
followed by a rush of the hands from
the factory exits. The girls walked
to seats on the seafront, jabbering like mag-
pies, and opened their lunch-baskets. The
young men gathered in groups about the
walls or on the corners of the streets and
talked excitedly of cricket. A few took
papers and books to quiet corners, and for
a time buried reality underneath fiction. A
group with ' backward glances from furtive
eyes climbed the fence of a vacant allot-
ment and vanished into a game of two-up,
leaving one to sit on the barrier, like a
cockatoo mounting guard for its mates rob-
bing a newly-sown wheat field.
There were eight boys playing. One was
watching the game, a hawk-eyed fellow of
about twenty. He was apparently more inter-
ested in the players than in the game, par-
ticularly in a sturdy youngster who was
revelling in his luck or skill. This lad
threw the pennies nearer the line than any
of them, and in the toss won nearly every
throw. But closely as he looked the hawk-
eyed lad saw nothing that suggested cheat-
ing ; and of cheating at two-up he knew
every move. Then his expression began to
betray envy, which changed to greed as the
sturdy lad’s winnings mounted up; then to
malice. There was no personal reason for
malice. It was just that the hawk-eyed boy
hated another fellow because he was luckier
in winning pennies. Nor did he have any
theories about it. He strolled nearer the
players, his px-esence scarcely noted, so eager
wei*e they in the game. The winner was
openly elated at his luck, and rattled the
coins in his pocket as he waited his turn
and tossed them with an air of a conqueror.
His companions were growing sullen. They
began to mutter things vaguely about the
Devil and his ways, with references to the
luck of dead Chinamen. At which the
sturdy lad only laughed; for he had done
the same thing himself when he had lost.
Then the hawk-eyed lad sneered at the
winner for a conceited fool, and kept on
sneering. The sturdy lad’s luck changed
for a few tosses, and he began to feel irrit-
able under the covert insults they dribbled
over him;
“Lucky at gamblin’, unlucky in love!”
sneered the hawk-eyed lad. The sturdy one
winced in spite of himself. There are no
secrets amongst factoi-y-hands.
“Look ’ere, you parrot-eyed lump ’o junk,
you leave me alone or I’ll push yer face
for yer,” said the the lad whose pocket was
heavy.
“If yer can yer can keep yer winnin’s,”'
said the hawk-eyed youth.
It was a direct challenge. An eager silence
fell upon them all. But when they measured
the sturdy lad against the thin and wiry
youth there was not much hope in their ■
glances.
“Yer oughter leai’n ter use yer dooks a
bit better befoi*e yer go asking fer fight,”
said the hawk-eyed lad’s second, as he helped
his gi'oggy principal to his feet after the
third round. “And it don’t do to look as
if yer wanted ter put the boot in, either,”
He stood another round, and then went
down till he was counted out.
“Is there any more o’ yer lookin’ fer ai’gu-
ments?” demanded the winner glancing round
truculently.
“Let’s get on with the game,” said a podgy
boy who seemed to feel the delay. “ ’Ow
much ’ave yer won up ter now, Tom?”
“About thirty bob,” saicj the champion,
with an assumed air of indifference.
“Make it sprats, an’ let’s see if yer luck’s
changed,” challenged the haw'k-eyed boy,
who had pushed in again.
But even sixpence for every penny won or
lost failed to scare Tom, and his luck im-
proved. The defeated youth saw the win-
nings rise to three pounds in 20 minutes.
Then, jumping to his feet and rushing over
to the sturdy youth, he shook his fist in his
face.
“You didn’t fight me fair, yer cur! I’ll
fight yer agen for the stake yer got in yer
pocket now.”
“Run away, little feller, or you might git
’urt,” *aia the champion.
But the others were sore at their losses;
to see somebody get a hiding had something
soothing in it, even if they had seen it
before.
“Garn, Tom, don’t try ter git outer it
that way,” jeered one of them; and Tom
threw off his coat defiantly.
“It’s all ther same ter me, Parrot-eyes—
or any one of yous.”
“It’s me,” said Parrot-eyes. “An’ this
time summun else is to hold the stake.”
Rather reluctantly Tom handed his money
to the smallest lad there.
For five minutes Tom pasted his opponent
with energy and considerable pleasure. Then
Pari-ot-eyes suddenly became something like
a windmill in a hurricane: his arms flew
round him and his fists seemed to hit Tom
everywhei’e at once. Before he had time to
feel surprise or to change his tactics he had
got a hit under the chin that was like a blow
from a sandbag. When he recognised his
surroundings five minutes later, it was in
response to the raucous yell of the factory
whistle. He put his hand on his pocket.
“What rotten, blanky luck!” And that
is all it was to liim.
The five-o’clock whistles shrilled through
the murky atmosphere. The hands streamed
from the odorous factory—odorous with sul-
phurous smoke and the pungent smells of
chemicals —and breathed the salt tang of
the air moving in lazily from the bay. The
sun was still above the horizon, its rays
gilding the dust and burnishing the westei’n
windows of the factory. Even the walls
themselves seemed to glow with a red
warmth.
As they walked along the paths the boys
and girls began to chaff each other with a
directness and simplicity that left little to
the imagination. In one group of girls was
a handsome brown-headed maid at whom her
companions addressed most of their remarks.
The gist of them was that she had “chucked”
Tom because she must have known he was
no fightei’, and that she had better take on
“Rat-eye” Bill Kennedy because he had
licked Tom and won his money, too. She
listened to it all intently, though her smile
derided them. Then the young fellow who
had been Tom’s second in the fight shouted
across the street that Rat-eye Kennedy was
more of a hawk than a rat. And Jinny
Harley went on listening intently.
As the hands scattered on their various
ways Jinny found herself in the same street
with Tom’s second. She beckoned him over
to her.
“What was the fight about between Tom
and Bill, Jack?”
He grinned. “It wasn’t over you, Jinny.”
“I know that as well as you,” she snapped,
feeling his intention to be rude. Then,
gently, “But tell me all about it.” With
elaboration and much exaggeration, Jack

GRATEFUL PEOPLE
VOICE THEIR PRAISE FOR ZAM-BUK.
Mr. J. Ashton.
m
Little Flome Lawson
Mr. Humphries.
CUTS, BRUISES, BURNS
AND PILES. —Mrs. J. Ashton,
residing at 335 Carrington Street,
Adelaide, says :—“Zam-Buk has
been a valuable asset in our home
for the healing of cuts, buims and
bruises; but my husband has had
even wider experience with Zam-
Buk than we have, as he contracted
piles, which gave him awful trouble.
The excessive irritation drove, him
distracted at times. After various
treatments had been tried, Zam-Buk
was used as a last resource. The
irritation subsided almost immedi-
ately. It was wonderful how Zam-
Buk soon cured him. It is a splen-
tid balm. Zam-Buk has proved
, st satisfactory all round in our
jome.”
AWFUL ECZEMA. —Mrs. A.
Lawson, of 61 Buckland Street, Sydney,
writes:—“My little girl had a bad attack
of eczema on her head. The irritation
was dreadful. Her head was in an awful
state. Having found the hospital treatment
of no use, I started treating the Eczeih;i
with Zam-Buk. The way Zam-Buk soothed
and stopped the itching was marvellous.
Zam-Buk seemed to get right to the root of
the disease, so that the sores eventually
dried oh, leaving nice, new skin behind.”
LEG GASHED WITH AN
AXE. Mr. W. Humphries, 51 Ferndale
Street, Newtown, Sydney, writes: —“l was
employed at wood-cutting and clearing scrub
in the country some time ago,* and often
met with accidents more or less severe.
On one occasion the axe slipped and my
leg was badly gashed. I applied Zam-Buk
by first spreading it on the bandage, and
this quick application of Zam-Buk un-
doubtedly prevented the wound becoming
more serious than it did. After I had per-
severed with the treatment for a little
more than a week the wound healed up
from the bottom, and in less than a fort-
night no trace of the injury was left.”
People the world over
sing the praises of
Zam=Buk. The won=
derful efficacy of this
famous Balm never
fails to give satis=
faction. Its variety of
medicinal properties —
healing, soothing, anti=
septic and germicidal—
has led to Zam=Buk
being described as “ a
complete surgery in a
two=inch pot.” Zam=
Buk contains neither
any rancid animal fat
nor mineral drug, such
as mercury, lead or
zinc.
Always keep a pot of
Zam=Buk in your home
and you will soon learn
how indispensable it is
for the accidents that
WILL happen.
LEG RACKED WITH RHEU-
MATISM. —Miss Evelyn Jacobs, of
48 Stephenson Street, Richmond,
Melb., says:—“l had an attack of
rheumatics, and was confined to bed
for days. The bone of my leg felt as
if it was trying to force its way out
of the heel of my foot. It was agonis-
ing. I was not able to get about, the
ankle was swollen, and the burning
and aching were terrible. I rubbed
Zam-Buk into the affected parts. I
felt relief almost straight away, and
after a week’s treatment with Zam-
Buk I could get about once more.”
MOTOR ACCIDENT. —Mrs. M
Kermode, 52 Vine Street, Redfern, Sydney,
writes: —“My son Tom met with a motor-
ear accident some time ago, breaking his
leg in two places. He was in Sydney Hos-
pital for a month, and after the plaster of
paris had been removed I massaged the leg
with Zam-Buk in order to keep stiffness
avyay and to make the sinews supple again.
I continued this treatment and he made a
rapid recovery and felt no ill-effects what-
ever from his accident. We have also used
Zam-Buk for sprains, and have the greates:
faith in it.”
ZAM-BUK NEVER FAILS.—
Mrs. Considine, of 234 Bolsover Street,
Rockhampton, writes: —“I have used Zam-
Buk for many years. My husband, while
carrying a heavy load on board ship, slipped
and bruised his chin very badly. Zam-
Buk took out all the inflammation and
healed the place very quickly. My eldest,
boy, Francis, knocked his foot on an iron
bar. Zam-Buk was promptly applied, and
before a pot had been used his foot w 4
quite well again. I have used Zam-Bui?
for piles, with wonderful success. It
took the congestion and irritation away,
and in a few days all the distressing symp
toms had completely disappeared.”

described it. She was bored. Fights were
the commonplace of her life.
“But what was it all about?” she asked,
when he had finished with the final uppercut
that knocked Tom out. He Scratched his
head : he was a dull young man. “Do you
think he let Tom lick him the first time to
fool him ?”
“Cripes, Jinny, never thought of that.”
“Thirty bob wasn’t worth winning, but
three quid was,” she suggested.
“Crikey, Jinny!” He stared about him
like a man seeking something that eluded his
perception.
“Kennedy wouldn’t walk out with the
pretties’ girl in the factory, if ’e could make
thrippence instead,” Jimmy added. But
even that failed to throw Jack a light on the
character of Rat-eye Bill, and its signifi-
cance eluded him.
Jinny looked at him with her slightly
derisive smile; then she said: “Jack, I
think Bill has more gumption than all the
factory” ; with which observation she turned
into the door of a grubby little house, and
left Jack .staring after her.
It was a very grubby little house. The
moment she was inside it Jinny’s expression
changed to sullen discontent. She had been born
in that house. Her first impression of it was
one of repulsion, a feeling that followed from
her first recollection to the present moment.
And she was 19 now. .She took off her hat
and proceeded to help her querulous mother
prepare the evening meal for her father and
half-a-dozen grubby little brothers and sisters
who were chasing each other about in the
street. Her father was a fireman in the fac-
tory. His only interest in life was his fur-
naces and boiler. Her mother’s only interest
was the daily routine of meals, the weekly
wash, and the price of commodities, which
was ever threatening to get beyond her power
to cover with the weekly wage. That was
all she understood of the world-war. Jinny
had forgotten the war; but the grubby house
was ever with her. The future revealed a
path her mother had trodden so heavily. She
had seen one way out of it that evening, dimly
at first, then more clearly as she sat silently
absorbed at the noisy table redolent of fried
onions. It was a little thing that finally
tilted her hesitation to purpose—merely the
furrows of perspiration down her mother’s
tired face; a face the woman had been too
tired to wash.
“I’m going out to-night, mother.”
“Orlrigbt, Jinny. But don’t be ’ome late,
or yer may miss yer work.”
Jinny went out that night, and nearly
every night for weeks. At the end of three
months she told her mother she was going
to get married. It was one of the inevitable
things to be accepted, like wages and bills.
But she had enough curiosity to ask : “Who
to, Jinny?”
“Bill Kennedy.”
“What, Rat-eye Bill! I think yer
mighter ehose somethin’ more like a man.”
“That’s what most of us do, mother. But
I’m thinkin’ of myself, not of Bill.”
At which her mother merely stared dully.
Her father remarked when she told him
that Bill would never make a proper fire-
man, and so he accepted the inevitable. Both
gave up her - weekly wages with silent mis-
giving. of which they said nothing. Which
was finer than either knew.
Jinny’s perception of the character of Bill
was right, and she saw nothing derogatory to
herself in finding that he loved money better
than her. In fact, she encouraged him in it.
Hard experience had taught her the value
of every penny, and she added her experience
to his, and helped him to make money. In
the beginning she was keener than he in the
small economies. As they saved their financial
field widened; then it carried them beyond
the smoke and tainted air of the manufac-
turing suburb. Bill wished to remain in it.
But that had never been Jinny’s intention.
She had other purposes with Bill which he
did not realise. In reality he knew nothing
of any purpose in her but to help him be-
cause of her affection for him. That meant
that all he was capable of in the way of
affection he had given to her. Jinny found
it a useful lever, and in a year she led while
she appeared to follow Bill into another
suburb, where they leased a. comfortable
cottage which they proudly called their villa,
and from which Bill went daily to a new shop
he had opened in the heart of the city, where
he sold toilet requisites, and Jinny kept the
books.
The people who came to purchase were
naturally women, in the main. Jinny
studied both their manners and their clothes.
Then she studied the men. Bill she found
slow to grasp the philosophy of appearances;
then he went into raptures over it as a business
asset when he discovered its business value.
In another year they took a bigger shop. A
year later they closed the shop and took a
warehouse; and in another suburb, remote
from whence they had come, they started a
factory for the manufacture of toilet re-
quisites of every kind except soap. Here their
own factory experience was invaluable. Then
they discovered the difference between whole-
sale and retail. It was a social one. The
villa at" once became too small, and the
northern suburb too narrow. They changed
to a southern suburb. From there Bill went
to the factory or warehouse in a motor; and
Jinny stopped at home. She did it because
the wives of her neighbors did it. It left her
in what was to her mere idleness. With
servants to do the work she once did her-
self, and infinitely better, she was astonished
to find that the discontent she had felt in
all her years with her mother returned to her.
It was an extraordinary discovery. She
forgot it at intervals—that was when Bill
came home and they discussed together their
business and investments. Bill was utterly
happy. Money and bonds, purchases and
sales, profits and occasional losses absorbed
every thought in his head. Her original
estimate of him had worked out correctly in
every detail. He was a calculating machiu“
that dealt in nothing but pounds, shillings
and pence, which worked with greater smooth-
ness with each increase in the load. In the
middle of explaining some new venture one
evening he found her attention flagging. He
looked at her irritably.
“You’re not listening, Jinny. What’s the
matter with you?”
The irritation in his voice sent a surge
of anger through her, and she looked at him
directly. But she said nothing. She made
another extraordinary discovery ; for she saw
with a clearness of perception that was terri-
fying—Rat-eye Bill, a shrivelled-souled thing
that could take a thrashing for thirty bob,
and give one to a better man than himself
for double the amount! To Bill’s alarm she
suddenly broke into a storm of angry tears.
“What the devil’s the matter with you.
woman?” he demanded angrily. “Blubbering
like a fool when I want to talk business!”
She saw beneath Bill’s well-cut clothes
the dungarees of the factory-hand, and under
his words the crude jeer of the street arab.
Rising from her chair, her first impulse was
to throw a book at him. In a flash she re-
membered that it was a rolling-pin she once
saw her mother throw at her father for some
grumble at his food. Dropping the book she
rushed from the room.
Jinny had discovered something she had
never suspected was in her nature. She had
hoped Bill would attempt to comfort her
with a caress.
* * 4 *
The discovery of her loss was to Jinny to
seek a remedy. Her first move was to go and
see her mother. The little cottage looked
grubbier than ever. Her mother spoke of
nothing but the skying of prices of food and
clothing. But two of the family had grown
old enough to enter the factory, and things
were easier for them financially. Jinny then
realised how selfish had been her abandon-
ment of the family. She offered her mother
money, and her mother put it quietly aside.
“ ’E’s your ’usban’, Jinny, an’ I can take
nothin’ from ’im.”
She turned scarlet, knowing that her
mother did not wish to say what she really
felt about Rat-eye Kennedy. He was out-
side the pale of her mother’s people.
Jinny called upon Tom, and found him
married. He told her proudly that he was
foreman now, and hoped soon to be manager
of his department. His wife stood beside
him with a child in her arms. They looked
ridiculously happy. Jinny felt ridiculously
hurt.
But still she sought what she had lost, with
no very clear idea of what it was. That
came from a business acquaintance of her
husband’s. And the inevitable happened.
One afternoon Mir. Kennedy returned to find
a note from his wife. It stated simply that,
she had left him, as he no longer loved her.
His astonishment was unbounded. But that
was all. And at that it might have re-
mained, only he suddenly realised that she
was the other half of his business brain. He
called upon a lawyer. Jinny had gone to
another State with the business acquaintance.
There were some 'negotiations—of which
Jinny knew nothing. Then it was her turn
to receive a note; and she found herself
abandoned.
A week later she received a letter from Bill
asking her to return. Suspecting nothing,
and having failed to find what she had been
seeking, she consented. They met as if no-
thing had happened. An hour afterwards
they were talking keenly over a business deal.
When it was done the husband slapped the
table joyously. An idea had struck him.
“I say, Jinny, I believe you schemed the
’ole thing!”
She smiled bitterly, and questioned him
with her eyes.
“I set a lawyer ter work,” he went on.
“I was makin’ that feller co-respondent, an’
claimin’ £5OO damages. ’E offered £5OO if
I’d withdraw the proceedin’s an’ take yer
back.” Rat-eye chuckled. “Why, Jinny, I’d
ha’ given ’im the money ter let yer come
back!”
There was a cold smile on her lips.
“We was born for each other, Jinny!” he
added exuberantly.
The cold smile froze on her icy face.

The Specialist
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
SO this was Death, this kindly, peering
man,
Whose glasses hid the meaning of his
eyes,
Whose voice was gentle, but aloofly wise.
Ilis grave words ran:
“Where, little one, is the throb of pain?
Ah, yes, I know, this small blue vein.”
A gaunt tree stood upon the plot of green
Between the quiet room and the loud
street;
Its branches, shaken by the traffic beat,
Stealthy, half-seen.
Wrote on the white walls of the room
Black, moving hieroglyphs of doom.
The trembling pallor in the girlish face
Misted my eyes; there seemed about my
dear
Silent white wings, fluttering white moths
of fear
In death-white grace.
A blade of steel flashed in a far
Cabinet like a chill, swift star.
Somewhere a bell! Somewhere ringing of
grief,
Ringing of flowers that die in the bud, die
In the shadow ; life but a fleeting lie
From God, the Thief!
That tiny, broken curve of snow
Was my child's hand... .kissed... .long
ago.
Then from remote and ringing distance
came
The voice of God —a kindly, peering God,
Whose sounding words marched through
all doubting, shod
With joyous flame:
“There is no fear; as the years go,
To sure sweet strength your flower will
grow.”
This is the street again ; the glowing sky
Is set with little suns for stars, and blent
With the faint smile, serene, indifferent,
Of the Most High.
The lamps of human tending shine
And my child’s hand is warm in mine.

GIVING OUT GOLD LICENSES AT BALLARAT IN 1853.
When the European gold-digger arrived at the scene of his labors, he found himself “unpleasantly brought into contact with a
Government in the construction of which, and in the direction of whose policy, he had no more voice than the naked aborigines he saw
prowling about in the bush. He was compelled to pay a heavy monthly tax levied upon him by an authority to which there was no appeal, and
in which he had no representation. The license to dig was a concrete symbol of all the grievances inevitable under such a state of affairs. The
tax was oppressive and unequal, and the manner of its collection so insolent and overbearing as to constitute in itself at least as legitimate
a ground for rebellion as had brought about the loss of England’s American colonies two generations before. “Injustice” and “Insolence”
the two words might very well suffice to explain the whole cause of the Eureka rising. There has seldom been a worse civil service than
that which administered the affairs of the early Victorian goldfields, and although the bloody little rebellion was abortive, it nevertheless
ended for ever government by ukase in Australia in times of peace.
Messrs. Brinds Pty. and Company, Limited, of Ballarat, distillers of the well-known brands of Brinds Whisky and Brinds Gin, are
giving away six pictures having to do with the famous Eureka Stockade episode of 1854—which is the only battle that has ever been fought
on Australian soil. The fight at Eureka hardly counts for as much, for instance, as the battles of the Marne or the Somme—but it marks
a distinct epoch in the struggle for Australian Democracy, and is, therefore, of the greatest interest to Australians. The drawings have
been executed by the Smith and Julius studios, and are fine works of art. There is no advertising matter on them, and it is only necessary
for those who wish to possess the set to write to Messrs. Brinds, at Ballarat (Vic.), enclosing stamps to the value of sixpence for postage, in
order to obtain them.
