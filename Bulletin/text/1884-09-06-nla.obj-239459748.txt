What is Socialism?
Wb wefe last week obliged to break off this
inquiry while it was still incomplete. We
had given some outline of the antiquity of
the question, a definition of its raison d'etre,
and a digest of one or two of its essential
contentions. Thus we had explained that
the complaint of Socialists is that modern
society is an organised anarchy which works
in antagonism to natural justice, and is
chiefly characterised by a systematised
“robbery of the poor.” We had digested
the arguments by which Socialists seek to
demonstrate that private ownership of land
is pernicious, and further, that the existing
relations between Capital and Labour are
oppressive and mischievous. We will now
rapidly review the ground covered so far,
and then proceed. Personal property is de-
fined by Socialists as that which is vroper to
a man—all the powers of body and mind
which by nature are his. Common property
is explained to be certain material things
which are essential for the maintenance and
renewing of personal property—in other
words, of a man’s powers, bodily and men-
tal; in short, of his healthy life. Further,
we have noted the deduction that by exer-
tion a man can create or develop exchange-
able values. That is to say, that by labour
—the exercise of his powers, mental or phy-
sical—applied to certain material things
which are “common property,” he can pro-
duce commodities fit for use. We have seen
also that honest exchange signifies the ex-
change of one commodity which has cost a
certain amount of labour to produce for
any other commodity which embodies the
exertion of an equal amount of labour.
And, Anally, we have noted how, by
introduction of machinery, one man may
monopolise to himself the occupation and
the labour-rewards of many, and while
accumulating substance beyohd his neces-
sities, leave those others deprived of returns
adequate to maintain themselves, and ulti-
mately compel them to accept, as his hired
slaves, less than the full value of their
labour, and thus artificially replace general
comfort of a modest kind with wretched-
ness and all its consequences of discontent,
envy, crime,! and the expensive machinery
for the control (repression being impossible)
of these evils.
• • •
We are reviewing, it must be remembered,
the theories of English Socialists. They say
that the existing Social system revolves in a
vicious circle. The capitalist robs the poor
of the value of his labour. But he is not
permitted to keep the spoils to himself. He
is comparatively a “little flea,” and has
“ bigger fleas to bite him.” The land-owner
squeezes the capitalist, and makes the latter
disgorge, in the form ©f rent, a large pro-
portion of the plunder, which the land-
owner then proceeds to squander, robber-
like, in personal gratifications and selfish
indulgence. But here we must interpose a
word for the land-owner and the capitalist
not in business. It would be absurd to pre-
tend that there is more than an economic
resemblance between robbers and plun-
derers and the propertied classes. It is
notoriously true that refinement and deli-
cacy follow to a great length the drift of
riches. It is notoriously true that among
the propertied and moneyed classes in Great
Britain and elsewhere are as large a propor-
tion—perhaps a larger proportion—of up-
right, honourable, pure-minded, audtender-
souled persons as there are among people of
a ny race and in any other condition of life.
There are among them individuals who
would distribute their whole substance in
charity, did they believe it would do any
good. But it is only recently that the Social-
ist system has been presented in a coherent
and intelligible form, and up to the pre-
sent time an economic gospel has been
taught—and that by persons clearly above
suspicion of partiality, or of being unduly
well-affectioned to the propertied and capi-
talist classes—the sum of which is that indis-
criminate or wholesale charity orparlition
would rather intensify than relieve the suf-
ferings of the poor, on the whole. This is
the Malthusian system, which even Mill,
radical thinker as he was, bowed before.
The wealthy classes, therefore, can distin-
guish no obligation or duty, and they are
slow to acknowledge the cogency—if co-
gency there be—of the arguments pro-
pounded by the Socialistic school now rising.
There is not, we believe, at the present day (
one very wealthy declared convert to So-
cialism. The very poor, on the other hand,
don’t understand the philosophy, although
they are ripe for acceptance of the broad
conception that they should share in the
general wealth of the nation. The apostles
of Socialism in Great Britain are mostly of
the lower middle class, men whose intellects
are developed and whose interests are almost
neuter. The rich can’t be expected to hail
the new philosophy with eager cordiality.
It is, doubtless, very pleasant to be rich and
distinguished, although, while the wretched-
ness produced by want hns no limit save a
miserable death, the pleasures afforded by
wealth are not of proportionate expansive-
ness. It is impossible, for instance, to be
utterly poverty - stricken, and yet easy-
minded and quite happy; but it is quite
possible to be immensely rich, and yet
utterly wretched. It is very difficult, even
for a candid-minded man of disciplined in-
tellect, to appreciate the force and verity of
arguments which jar equally against his
preconceptions, his sentimental ideas, bis
early training, and his religious impressions,
and the adoption of which would further
strip him of honourable affluence and grati-
fying distinctions. And among the wealthy,
as compared with the middle classes, ele-
gance rather than severity of mental
training, prevails. They are not, as a
class, trained to be close reasoners, nor
to pride themselves upon dispassionate
unselfishness of views. And, besides, they
are taught from childhood and throughout
life, by a most reverend and respeotacle
order of priests, that their happy condition
is due to the decrees of Providence, and that
to question the justice of the inequalities of
fortune which prevail is to tly in the face of
the Almighty, and blaspheme His holy
ordinances.
♦ * *
This brings us straight to another of the
authorities the Socialists quote for their
system. They dispute for possession of the
theological ground; and while challenging
the most reverend and respectable—that is
to say, the most highly paid—priests, as per-
sonally concerned to justify a system by
which they receive infinitely more than the
value of their labour and talents, the Chris-
tian Socialist appeals direct to the Bible.
While the majority of the clergy continue
to inculcate a divine sanction for monopoly
and so ingratiate themselves with the classes
which have the gifts of bisnoprics and fat
incomes, a little band, headed in the Estab-
lished Church by the Rev. Canon Shuttle-
wobth, the Rev. Stuart Headlam, and
Rev. C. W. Stubbs, are preaching the Social-
ism of Chbist. And, away in the North,
Scotch ministers are allying themselves with
the League for the Restoration of the Land
to the people at large, and a fresh Solemn
League and Covenant is being signed numer-
ously by the people of Scotland, while even
in Australia the most courageous of the
apostles of Henry George’s theories is the
Rev. W. T. Carter of South Australia. By
such as these the Christian Socialist is
written. Its motto is that
“While continuing the Christian spirit, upon
which the teachings of Maurice and Kingsley
were based, we will not hesitate to advance the
principles of Socialism with all the significance
which has been added to that term by the patient
Investigation of the last B5 years.”
• • •
These teachers, with nothing to hope in the
way of worldly, ecclesiastical, or social ad-
vantage, but all the contrary, enter the Held
of disputation, like the Covenanters of old,
Bible in hand. They appeal to the law of
Moses : “The land shall not be sold for ever;
for the land is mine. Ye are strangers and
sojourners with me.”—(Lev. xxv. 23 ct scq.)
And when they are told that the old Dispen-
sation has expired, they turn to the teach-
ings of Christ, and quote afresh, with awful
emphasis: “ Give us this day our dally bread”
—a petition obviously not framed for capital-
ists ; “ Lay not up for yourselves treasures in
earthand, again, “ If thou wilt be perfect,
go sell all thou hast and give it to the poor;”
and “ It is easier for a camel to pass through
the eye of a needle than for a rich man to
enter into the kingdom of heaven.” And,
still working this mine of Social ethics, they
allege the parable of Lazarus and Dives, in
which Christ depicted Dives going to hell
for no apparent vice other than that he had
suffered Lazarus to be in misery at bis gales
and had made no effort to relieve hi m. Now,
they argue, in London, Lazarus is always at
the gate of Dives— only it is at the back gate:
the policeman would attend to him did he
trouble at the front. At the oack of Mayfair
lies Horrible Loudon. The slums are within
a stone’s-throw of my Lord’s conservatory In
Belgravia.
Now for the remedy. As we understand
the writers whose conceptions we are review-
ing, the remedy which the Socialists propose
for tne anarchy which afflicts humanity is
Communism. “Common property,” that is
to say the forces and opportunities furnished
by nature for the maintenance of life, they
would recover from the persons who now
monopolise any part of it, and they would
make it really common property. Thus,
land, water, light, air, would be all equally
free and accessible, and all would be worked
and put to use to the best possible advantage
for the general benefit. Secondly, the pro-
ductive power of machinery would be com-
munised. The benefit and the saving would
not be divided between the capitalist and
the land-owner—it would be distributed
among all. But here a potent objection in-
terposes. “ What!” cry the critics, “ deprive
genius of its reward ? Take away the induce-
ment from inventors ? The world would
stand still.” Here we find the objection met*
and, we think, bravely and nobly met.
Treating not merely of the inventor, but of
“ the poet, the painter, the prophet or reprover of
falsehood and baseness, the lawyer or obtainer of
justice, the physician, the statesman or governinpr
man, each and all of these live to benefit
their fellows, and by their iellows they must be
maintained.” But “let this be clearly under-
stood that, for every non-producer who is
so supported, the producers are called upon
for additional exertions, or else the common
store would be diminished, and this also that
these nonproduoers are not to be maintained
at any price they may choose to estimate their
services at, but that all that the community eac

lives to them in as happy and noble condition as
the hardest w orker or actual producer.”
Here we find a spirited passage:—
“A pretty state of matters this would be. It Is
derisively cried; a nice incentive to discovery and
Invention, that! Nothing Is more characteristic of
this corrupt and Mammon-loving ago than this,
that all groat and noble wort is deemed impossible
save through hope of money reward. W ith all my
heart and soul I protest, and to my latest breath I
shall continue to protest, against this foul and de
graded conception of human nature. Hold this
belief If you will, but understand that to do so Is to
deny all that is high and pure in man ; to Ignore all
that is noble and inspiring in history. Hold it if
you will, but recognise that you—whose only con-
ception is of man as a being, the origin of whose
every effort lies In his rapacity and greed—have
left It to the despised Socialist to conceive of him
as one who may possibly be moved to high en-
deavour byasimple desire to servehis fellow-men;
left it to him to believe that Shakespeare wrote,
that Burns sang, and Carlyle taught—that Watt
sought to wrest from Nature the secret of the
power of steam, and Stephenson planned how
best to utilize it—from something other In them
than the lust of gain."
• • *
Proceeding, however, with our investiga-
tion of the Socialistic proposals, we quote
afresh from Htndmas and Morris
“ For reconstruction and reorganization we So-
cialists continually strive, looking to the com-
pletest physical, moral, and Intellectual develop-
ment of every human being as the highest form of
the social state, as the best and truest happiness
for every Individual and for every class, where, as
none need overwork, so none shall be able to force
others to work for their profit.”
Meeting here the sneer Utopian, these
writers contend that it may have been
Utopian years ago, but that the very causes
which have deepened social disorder have
facilitated the remedy. The tendency to
work everything on a big scale, and by
companies or associations, prepares, they
say, the way for State control, or, in other
words, communal operation of all depart-
ments of Exchange and so forth. They
would have the railways worked by the
State; so also with shipping; so with hank-
ing. They say the economical forms are
ready, and that the transfer could be ar-
ranged almost without a hitch —which seems
to us somewhat oversanguine. And the
means of affecting this social revolution?
Well, they arc clear only in one particular.
Manhood suffrage to begin with. Thus
“To avoid alike the crushing anarchy of to-day
and the fierce anarchy of to-morrow, we strive to
help forward the workers to the control of the
State, as the only means whereby such hideous
trouble (the reference is to the dynamite tendency
of the desperate of these days) and production and
exchange can be organised for the benefit of the
country at large, 'thus, therefore, we propose
that all should have the vote; not that tbs vote
will free them from economical oppression, but
because in this way alone is a peaceable issue pos-
sible for the possessing classes. It is better ” (here
there is a gleam of teeth) “ for them to yield to the
vote of organised opinion than to the victory of
even organised force.”
In fact, the Socialists do not disguise that
they mean business. With respect to oom T
pensation, they say:—
“ But this is confiscation. Far from It, it is resti-
tution. Those who cry for compensation for past
robbery, and shriek confiscation because the right
to rob in future is challenged, should bear in mind
that the men and women whom we would com-
pensate are th se who are now stumbling half-
clothed and half-fed from a pauper cradle to a
pauper grave, in order that capitalists and land-
lords may llv- in luxury and excess. The dead
have passed beyond compensation; it will be well
if the living do not call for vengeance on their
behalf. Our first principle as Socialists Is that all
should be well-fed, well-housed, well-educated.
For this object we urge forward the Revolution
which our enemies hysterically shriek at, and
frantically try to dam back. But we mean wrong
to none. Rather would wo claim the aid of s ich
of the luxurious classes as are willing, so long as
they have still enough and to spare, to forego the
frightful privilege of feeding fat upon the wretch-
edness of others.”
And they conclude thus:—
“ Therefore, we say once more this i>a class war;
we know it; we are preparing for it; we rejoice at
its near approach. We mean to brt ak down com-
petition, and to substitute universal organisation
and co-operation. There lie around us the neces-
sary methods: they need but to be applied. But
there are many dllfioultiek and dangers, the power
of wealth la great, the unscrupulousness of pro-
perty knows no bounds? We are well aware of
this: we see and do not shrink from the inevitable
struggle. But the numbers over against us, the
hosts who may be bribed to fight for their op-
pressors, even to their own hurt; there are thou-
sands, perhaps millions, of such men ? There are.
We know that, too. But in a cause like ours, we
refuse to recognise difficulties; with such misery
around us, we cannot atop to calculate forces; with
such a future before us, we will never count
heads.”
At which wo will for the present leave them
in the hands of our readers.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
“Herald” versus George.
In a pretended review on a work on Socialism, the
Sydney Morning Herald does two grossly dis-
honest things. In the first place, it pretends to
review the work, and nevertheless leaves the
meaning of the author totally obscure. In the
second place, it recommends perusal of certain
pages, “too long to be quoted,” to “any poor
student who has become dazed and bewildered by
the theories of Henry George.” Now, why
should any poor student who reads the S.M
Herald he dazed and bewildered by George's
theories, unless the S.M. Herald has neglected its
functions of public teacher and failed to make clear
the fallacies of theories of enormous currency
and in its opinion liable to daze and bewilder y
As a matter of fact, the Herald confessed itself
either Impotent or cowardly, when confronted by
the prevalence of Henry George’s theories—
theories which have already sunk deep into the
very souls of the independent-thinking class of all
conditions of life, and of the masses of English,
reading people throughout the world. The editor
of the S.M. Herald did commence in the Echo
and the Mail a series of articles designed to crush
the absurd pretensions of Henry George to main-
tain positions and theories which tended to show
that it was neither rational nor right that certain
thousands of men should own the globe, and so
Impose penurious subjection upon almost all the
rest of the human race. Of these promised ar-
ticles, two, or perhaps three, only were published.
Then there was sudden and quite unannounced
Silence evemuwe, We had the pleasure ol
laughing: a little. In print, at these opening
articles, and of showing, amidst other things, that.
In his eagerness to controvert George’s principles,
the talented author had been so unfortunate as to
surpass his own expectations, and to equally con-
trovert the principles of his Saviour. In fact, If
ever there was a poor student who had become
“ dazed and bewildered *’ by the Georgian theories,
the Herald’s own essayist appeared to be the
man. We do not, however, fora moment flatter
the S. M. Herald by supposing that it was its per-
ception of the ridiculous plight we had shewn It
to have tumbled into which occasioned the sudden
and unexplained interruption and cessation of Its
announced series which was to make mince-raeat
of Henry George. If our Information be correct*
and we seriously affirm that we have reason
to believe it to be entirely reliable, the
literary genius was complacently satisfied with the
efficacy of tho arguments published, but the pro-
prietorial genius Interposed. It has almost in-
variably been a tacit assumption among wealthy
men that a man's talents are proportionate to his
wealth. Thus the proprietory of the S.M. Herald,
scanning the situation with comprehensive vision,
perceived that Henry George was a writer who
owed his fame, not at all to any real genius, but to
an accidental and transitory notoriety: that he
and bis doctrines merely subsisted on discussion,
and would sink Into oblivion were he and they
severely left alone. The mandate went forth that
the Sydney Morning Herald should treat
Henry George with silent contempt, and so blot
him and his system of political economy out of
existence altogether.
Public Spirit.
The community will be gratified to learn that by
the public spirit and enlightened devotion of some
of the senior officers in the Lands Department, the
colony has just been saved from a grave outrage-
The principles of free, secular, and compuls no,
that’s not exactly it. The fact is that an insidious
and Jesuitical attempt to corrupt the minds of the
young of tee next generation of N. S. Wales has
been attempted and failed. Since the failure of
Bishop Barry to work u;» any sort of agitation
against the undenominational character of the
Public School teaching has become an obvious
and assured fact, his partizans have resorted to
dark and devious devices. They have even at-
tempted to seduce the minds of the young through
their Australian Geography, and to instil poison
into the public mind by the medium of parish
maps. A rule of the Lands Department is, that
when parishes attain, by expansion of settlement,
unmanageable proportions, they are to be subdi-
vided Into two or more portions, to one of which
is given a new name. To an emissary of Satan, or
Bishop Barry, or the Pope—wo are not sure
which—fell the business ot dividing into three
parishes, the parish of Corong. He expended
upon the requisite work, in mapping, draughting,
and so forth, several months of time. And finding
no local names which would come handy for the
new parishes, he veutuied to adopt two names
at the moment somewhat prominently before the
public. He named the subdivisions the Parish of
Barry and the Parish of Moran. This outrage
came under the observation of a high-minded
and public-spirited officer, who, being a believer
only in Pope Jeffeeis, instantly detected the
latent mischief of such nomenclature. Were our
people to be wronged and demoralized by such in-
sidious methods, and he stand by ? Not it he knew
it! God forbid! You bet! He ordered the divi-
sion to be cancelled. True, this nullified the value
of all the work done. The obnoxious names were
obliterated, the maps cancelled. It cost the
country something, truly. But what of that? The
Integrity of our undenominational and unsec-
tariau geography was preserved, and the young
Idea will continue to Improve itself by contem-
plating the soul-strenghening word Mesopot we
mean “ Corong."
Fiat Justitia, Ruat Coelum.
The above heading is certainly not plain English.
But we propose to give the plain English for it,
and also some plain English about it. The sentence
is a Latin proverb, and means “ Let Justice be done
though the heavens should fall.” The proverb is
very popular, and has had a long and strong inilu-
ence in even liberal-idea'd people a minds. We
only refer to It in order to point out that it em-
bodies a philosophy totally false. Its purport is
that terrible things may happen if Justice be un-
compromisingly adhered to, and it exhorts people
to face any catastrophe rather than depart from
principle. The advice is good, but, as we said
before, the philosophy is false. Our contention is
that no terrible thing can result from unswerv-
ing adherence to Justice. We want people to
comprehend that If Justice [be done the heavens
will not fall. That, in fact, Justice pillars the
Heavens, and the more of it there is the more is
the celestial altitude assured. Let Justice be
done, we say, not with fear and trembling lest the
Heavens should fall, but with the firm assurance
that the more that Justice is done, the higher, the
clearer, the brighter will be the Heaven above us.
As Captain Jack Bunsby would say, “thebearing
of these observations lies in the application of
them, and the application is pretty wide. Just
to start the thing, we will point out that it is a
regular habit of people to say tha" such and such
principles are all very well, they agi ee with them
in the abstract, and admit their justness. But
then, supposing they were to be carried into prac.
tioe, how would you provide against this, that, or
the other catastrophic contingency ? In other
words, how would you keep the Heavens from
failing? Now, put it this way again: that the
Heavens are pillared by Justice. Then the argu-
ment is that if you maintain a pillar, instead of
knocking it out of the way, the heavens will fail-
will fail because you won’t knock away the sup-
ports I Rubbish.
A Dismal Festivity.
The failure of Sir Henry Parkes, in his first set-
speech after arriving, is not to bo set down, pro-
bably, to any real deterioration of ids powers
L'he circumstances were deeply depressing. A
cloud seemed to lower over the banquet, and to
weigh upon the spirits of the participants. The
/ery personnel of the banqueters was discouraging.
There were no new faces added since he left—none
which afforded testimony that anything had been
forgotten or forgiven since East Sydney spurned
him from the hustings. It was the same old crowd
which saw him off. Not one ventured to arise and
cheer the guest by those laudatory expressions
which are ordinarily so easily pumped up. The
heavy task of proposing the toast of the evening
was delegated to a gentleman who spoke merely
ejo-vfflcio, and without a grain of enthusiasm. No
peg was afforded for Sir Henry to clutch, no
personal extravagance of laudation which he
might have affected to accept as the voice of a
delighted community. Consequently, his reply
was divided between a laboured endeavour to
avoid seeming to apologise for himself, and a
mal-apropos attack upon the present Ministry-
Sir Henry obviously felt that something was
necessary to be said with regard to his absence
from the post of public duty during the present
momentous session. He attempted the justi-
fication, and succeeded only In professing
to hold the narrowest view of his own duties
and of a public man’s functions ever offered
to the public. He, claiming to be a states-
man, ignored his relations, as such, to the
colony as a whole. He voluntarily—or, as the
easiest horn of a very excruciating dilemma—be-
littled his own importance. He affected to believe
that no explanation was due to the colony—that
Sir Henry Parkes’ presence or absence during a
session of Parliament is a matter which concern s
only his own constituents. Tenterfleld had granted
him leave of absence; and Tenterfleld—that is to
say, Mr. Whereat and a little clique pretending
to speak for the whole constituency—had extended
that leave. Tenterfleld (i.e. Whereat) being satis-
fied, the colony oh, the colony be damned I
“ What am I to the colony, or the colony to me ? ”
was the burden of Sir Henry’s explanation. As
for his attack upon the Government, Sir Henry
singled out the weak spots in the Ministerial armour
with all his pristine felicity. Much that he said was
true. But who was he, that he should challenge the
weakness or the errors of Ministers ? While he had
abandoned his public post, as soon as he had been
deprived of a position which carried with it pecu-
niary emolument, they, at any rate, had been work-
ing to the best of their abilities, and, as we belle ve t
honestly, even If unsuccessfully, for the public ot
the colony.
Dorsal Weakness.
The failure of the Stuart Ministry to frame a
decent Land Bill Is a source of sincere disappoint-
ment to many people who, as a rule, expect little
from political reforms. Two years ago, the noto-
rious vices of the existing system provoked a re-
volt against the Parkbs-Robertson Government*
and at the general election in December, 1883, the
polling booths w**re thronged by enthusiastic
voters keen to lend their aid in the settlement
of a question that had for years vexed New South
Wales. The expectations of th-i public were
reasonable enough. They saw the country wasted
by the contentions of squatter and selector, and
they hoped that Mr. Stuart had found a way to
deal fairly with both interests, and at the same
time to lecover a reasonable area of the colony
as a reserve available for future settlement.
There was nothing extravagant in this. A re-
form that aimed at less could hardly be reform
at all. Both of the conflicting Interests com-
plained of insecurity, and both professed their
willingness to waive prescriptive claims, provided
they could acquire substantial tenures. The
squatter held his grazing right only from Thurs-
day to Thursday, and he was quite willing to
abandon one half of the territory of which he held
the temporary occupation, provided he got an ab-
solute tenancy of the other half. The selector, on
the other part, was quite willing to give up his
legal right of gutting the whole colony, provided
there were certain portions of country faithfully
conserved for purposes of settlement. The public
voice gladly assented to the policy suggested, but
the Government which undertook to carry it into
practical form, plainly h ,d little conception of the
work to be faced. A revolution was aimed at, and
a revolution, to be successful, must be carried out
by revolutionary methods. To deal with the
question thoroughly would have been an
achievement worthy of a statesman, for great
difficulties stood in the way, and great
issues were at stake. Still, in the hands
of a Minister capable of grasping the sub-
ject, there were Immense resources available for
carrying the work to a successful completion.
The public were promised valid areas for settle-
ment, clear from all conflicting interests. The
Crown lessees were offered secure leases, with
every encouragement to reclaim the waste and
arid country. Ne,ther one promise nor the other
has been kept. But, through the gap disclosed by
these very shortcomings, there appears the end
of the lever, which, in a strong hand, might have
done what was wanted. The squatters have been
allowed to retain their obstructive attitude to
selection on the resumed areas. Would it not
have been a wise thing to take this power com-
pletely out of their hands, and to conciliate them

The routine of ten years’ pettifogging land-agency

bled back into the Robertsonian quagmire with
the mechanical precision of a tip-cart. How Mr.
Stuart could ever have expected him to inaugur-
ate a new policy with masculine vigour must re-
main an enigma. His appointment was probably
the first symptom of that spirit of “ compromise ”
which appears all through the proceedings of the
last year, and which has made the Land Bill an
emasculated, featureless product, worthy of a
Ministry without a backbone. When the Cabinet
filled the chair of the Lands, they might have
remembered that a few years before, when the big
stations were being “peacocked” and "secured,”
«n ex-Minister who had gained golden opinions in
Riverina by his pliability in office and his sub-
servience out of it, received in the most welcome
form a pleasing recognition from a Melbourne

whether the characteristic thus displayed proved
the fitness ot the man for the critical work of re-
casting the land system ot the country.

meeting of the Council, a resolution was carried
deputing the episcopal head and a couple of mem-
bers to wait on Mr. Service and beg him to run
bis arm into the taxpayers’ pockets, and draw out
gome more money to be spent by the men who, in
conjunction with God’s anointed, control the
higher education of Victoria. The precise pur-
pose to which the extra allowance shall be devoted,
baa not yet been fixed upon. Some recommend
that Professor Strong s old duties should be
divided between two men-so that, instead of a
professor of Latin and Creek, there would be one
of Latin and another ot Greek and Comparative
philology. Some recommend that the additional
money should be spent In the teaching of Science
and some again In the teaching of modern lan-
guages. The thing they have made up their minds
to since they got the Church among them 1?, that

The actual sentiments of the Andersen sympa-
thisers have been at length accurately defined.
Thanks are due to Mr. Neill, who, at the meeting
on Friday last, ventured to remark that Ander-
SEN’sloffence had been filthy and disgusting, for
eliciting the real feeling ot the agitators. They
hooted and hissed Mr. Neill tor hinting at such a
thing. The public can, therefore, now understand
to protect their wives and daughters from such
spectacles as tho drunken Andersen and his bar-
lot provided for the delectation of passers-by, they
would be apt to take the law into their own hands.

The State at the present time advances £11,000, and
somewhere about an equal amount is contributed
by fees. We are not opposed to the making of a

from this line of policy ? To grant them the add!-*
tional funds they now pray for is to confer on then-

are visible. The Senate, forty of whose members

refuse to discharge their duties. Twice in the pre-

hold that such proceedings as Andersen and his i

marriage to “ Coutts.” In doing so he was very
candid. He is ever so much more Mr. Coutts than
the Baroness is Mrs. Bartlett.
Labouchere, when asked why he believed

berland showed that by the mere cultivation of
physical perceptions, and by watching the in-

had his eye on the precious spoil, which has since
been bought for the colony, but at a price much

English authorities take Jeremiah at his word, and
send over to him, as a present from “ the boys,’ a
packet of panclastite and fulminating powder
marked “contributions,” and a case of nitro-
glycerine and clock-work labelled “ whisky.”

Our N. S. Wales experience has bitterly
taught us that it is better to have this sort of thing
settled before the property and liberty of men are
placed at the mercy of any man. Speaking of the
proposed appointment of a Judge, the Northern
Territory Times says of the nomination of Mr.
Pater: "Hemay be a clever criminal lawyer, but
he lacks many of the attributes which a Judge
should possess; briefly, his temperament is ner-
vous and excitable, his temper is hasty and violent,
and he shows his sympathy with one side of the
cases which are brought before him, hastily,
before 1 he cases have been fully ventilated. Mr.
Pater has proved himself to be utterly unfitted for
the position of a Judge, and we sincerely trust the
matter will receive careful consideration before
the appointment is made. If the country is to pay
£1000 a year for a professional man let us at least
have one who possesses the attributes of a lawyer
combined with the demeanour of a gentleman.
Bombast, irritability, and vindictive spleen are
qualities we can dispense with.”
The home papers just to hand contain a
story about an elderly gentleman, handsomely
attired, putting up at the Victoria Hotel, Preston,
and sending out someone to look for his wile, to
whom he had been married thirty years before.
The couple separated soon after their weddl g,
both being out of work. The husband enlisted
and “proceeded” to Australia, whence he only
returned the other day; and when he did find his
better-half, things had improved with her, for she
was at work —as a charwoman. An interview be-
tween the two was arranged, when the elderly
gentleman declared himself to be her husband.
At first, the lady declined to entertain such an idea;
but subsequent conversation, and presents of an
auriferous description, convinced her that she
stood In the presence of her long-lost husband.
The pair have since left Preston, to take up their
abode in Belfast. We have often chanced unon
cases (in the Divorce Courts) where a woman has
been persuaded by presents “ of an auriferous
description ” that she was a man s wife.
A decree of separation has been pronounced
between the Grand Duke of Hesse and Madame
Kolemlne. A good deal of bad feeling has been
Imported into this case. If a widower falls in love
and chooses to marry the woman he loves, it is
hard lines that he should have his windows broken.
There is not one of the royal ladies and gentlemen
who have been so Indignant over the marriage
who would have said a word had the liaison been
unsanctioned by the law. And the Hesse-Darm-
stadters themselves, who have made the place too
warm for the Grand Duke, would have been his
obedient hat-doffing subjects still, had he given his
heart to twenty ladies instead of his hand to one.
Such is the world! And, talking of Kolemme,
we are reminded ithat Sir Henry Parkes did not
succeed in floating his Jervis Bay coal property.
The English people just now have an awkward
habit of asking, when they are offered a good

thing, wo are sorry, for the sake of the colony,

King Tawhaio, we read, visited a London
Cotfeo Palace, the other day, and was received
“with much enthusiasm.” The enthusiasm was,
no doubt, all on the side of the Colfee I alace
people. A man who, like Tawhaio, has been
accustomed to sharpen his teeth on a grindstone
before wolfing the baked remains of his enemies,
can’t afford to become enthusiastic on mere coffee.
A more horrible decoction than that which in
London passes current as Mocha, can’t be ima-
gined by anyone out of Sydney. London coffee
seems to be made out of marine glue, decomposed
snuff, stale porter, and human hair. You can be
sure about the last-named ingredient, for you have
only to make a dive with your spoon to fish up
half a dozen hairs from the bottom of your two-
penny cup of sorrow. They say it’s all right—the
hairs are only waitress’s hairs. A workman who
saw Tawhaio fishing up long red hairs and throw-
ing them on to the floor - apparently in sheer dis-
gust that tne head of the copper-topped waihena
who waited on him wasn’t attached to them—
grimly remarked, “They seem to have been boil-
ing down a stiff ’un. your Majesty.” The King
said nothing, but went on stoking in peas with his
knife.
“The Duke of Albany’s will was drawn
out a few days before his marriage, and ne signed
it at Windsor directly after the ceremony, before
he left the Castle for Claremont. He was in a very
critical state of health at that time, and he would
not allow an hour to pass without settling his
affairs.” Tnis is from the World, which toadies
to Koyalty, and it all reads very prettily indeed.
Judging from the Lord Colin Campbell divorce
case and the case of the late Duke of Albany, it
seems that now-a-days the obility, et cetera,
doesn’t think of marrying until it is ready for the
grave. By and bye it will, no doubt, be fashion-
able for “our betters” to be attired for the altar
in winding-sheets, and to bo c .rrled to church in
coffins. But even that will be better than tne
present style of thing, for, though a man who gets
married after he’s dead (instead of getting married
when he ought to be dead) may leave a wife who
will draw £0000 a year from the revenue, it is
probable that, unless the age of miracles comes
again, a dead gentleman will not, as in the present
case, leave two children who, in some capacity or
other, will sooner or later be foisted on the bleed-
ing country at big screws.
From the evidence, in the case of Weldon
v. Semple, of Dr. James Edmunds, an eminent
English brain-doctor:—Cross-examined as to the
nature of insanity: There were various kinds of
insanity, and we were all more or less unsound.
Mr. Justice Hawkins: That is the very question 1
was going to ask you—is there any exception to
that? Witness: None, except, perhaps, your lord-
ship when sitting in court. To Mr. Anderson: If
Mrs. Weldon had said she had believed that the
spirit of her dog had been seen by the boy, he
should have considered her insane. Mr. Justice
Hawkins: You do not believe in animals having
souls? Witness: Well, manv animals came down
from heaven in a sheet, and I do not know what to
think. Re-examined: Ho was not a Spiritualist.
Ho did not see why Atheists should not go mad. Is
seeing visions a sign of insanity ?—St. Paul saw
visions. When St. Paul fell down and saw a bright
light, my impression is that he had an attack of
sunstroke or an epileptic fit. Balaam was not in-
sane in believing tnat he heard his ass speak if the
ass had actually spoken. Swedenborg I should
think decidedly insane, though not fit to be de-
tained; and I should think John Wesley was, in
times of exaltation, Insane for a time. t
Prince Krapotkine, who was, with Louise

have produced alveolo-perlostite, and the doctor
fears I may have osteo-periostite. At any rate, my
teeth are all dropping out. Last week I pushed
out with my tongue a great canine tooth, quite
sound, and the doctor says I shall lose in the same
way all four teeth, which are also quite sound.
However, autumn being near, my health may im-
prove, and if no complications come it may con-
tinue so until towards the end of winter, when the
scurvy will come on again worse than ever. But
all this is a bagatelle. We are so happy, my wife
and myself *hat we can work together for several
hours per day, that wo think and speak more
about our literary undertakings than about other
things,”
The Bombala Jonas says, “ We do not
often agree with Mr. Buchanan;” and whilst reel-
ing with apprehension as to the probable upshot
if this feud between two of the greatest thinkers
of the age, we recalled the fact that David has
written an essay in the D.T. on Thomas Carlyle,
and as the old man is dead first, we will recall an
anecdote of h'm. It might help David when he
proposes to grapple with the Bombala Bombastcs
Furioso. Gillillau was a preacher in Dundee, and
a good man—although a Presbyterian He gave
Garibaldi an invitation to Scotland, for instance.
His congregation was composed chitflyof working
men and tradesmen; and although, from his high
•iterary attainments, he did have many divine
“calls” to big “steepends” from more cultured
classes, be stuck to his kirk and went on with his
work. He died a few years ago, and Is best known
by his gallery of literary portraits—a collection of
essays written in "Blackwood” and elsewhere. Car-
lyle had written the “Sartor,” and was fast ram-
ming his way into fame. He, too, had been trained
for the kirk, but couldn’t “see it.” Gilflllan “ went
for” him. Somebody said to Carlyle, “D’ye hear
what Geordie’s been saying about you ?” “ What
Geordie?” asked Mr. Kesartus. “ Geordie Gil-
flllan. Why, he says ” “ Who Is Gilfillan?” he
asked, wondering like. Now, David, Just try it in
that musical way of yours—Who’s Jonas ?
QUITE RIGHT [III]
“Mr. and Mrs. James South (nec Edith
Pender) have become reconciled and live together
again.”—News.
Quite right! You know, we gossip flout.
And pinn’d our faith on Edith Pender;
And, when mad wags put tales about.
Out flashed our fuulchions to defend her.
But there was no need for a tussle;
No need for play of Jimmy’s muscle—
For lo, behold, those two
Once more do bill and coo—
Quite right!
It seems ’twas but a baliverne—
A Joke—whichever way you turn it;
The public were too dense, we learn
(As oltthe easels), to discern it!
A feather—puff I ’tls on the wind,
No trace at all it’s left behind;
For, with a loving thrill,
They once more coo and bill —
Quite right!
Quite charming fun I a few small jokes
Like these but are as airy bubbles;
The world is “giddy,” and the folks
But murmur lightly, “Pooh, ‘our troubles!
Some really, "thought, you know—because . , .”
But that shows what a joke it was 11
For lo, behold, they’re willing,
Once more to be wooing;
Once more to be billing,
Once more to bo cooing—
Quite right!
An interesting fact, which we do not think
has ever been mentioned In print, is that a wonder-
ful facial likeness exists between Henry Irving
and his “associate” Ellen Terry. Anyone who
keeps this in mind while looking at the respective
photographs of the pair will at once notice where
the resemblance lies. By the way. Irving’s Mal-
volio did not meet with the favour of his audi-
ences, and though it was highly puffed by all the
dally papers of London, where it is fashionable to
admire Irving, it is described by a very competent
critic, “Carados,” as “thoroughly original, but
beinu thoroughly original it Is thoroughly wrong.”
Apropos, Irving, undeterred by the fate of Mr.
James Albery, has begun to show temper, and to
rudely and impertinently lecture his audiences.
In the “ Twelfth Night ” revival the success of tee
evening was won by Ellen Terry, whose Viola was
enchanting. We read that she started rather ner
vously after Viola had transformed herself into
the page Cesario, bat nervousness may readily be
pardoned in an actress when for the first time she
shows her legs to the public. It is satisfactory to
fl id that Ellen’s legs are good ones “straight and
shapely, and highly creditable to their possessor ’•
So that Miss Terry, as an actress who is literallV
good at all points, must be held to have a clear
advantage even over the Langtry, who, says a
recent 8. P. Newsletter, “when she is satis fac
tory as an actress, it is a que tion of flesh and
bones, and not art.” Which recalls a cnt cism of
an Indian chief, who, when in Washington, was
taken to see a burlesque show. After the per
formance he remarked, through an interpreter"
that the Great Father was very kind to send the
poor Indians blankets, when they were so much
needed at home.
Thomas Hunt is the name of a gentleman
who toed the scratch at the City Court, Melbourne
a few days ago. to defend himself from the charge
of not having lost a shingle, but of being minus
the whole of the root of his head entirely. One of
Mr. Hunt’s fads is that ho has just finished a house
in Emerald Hill, which is capable of accommodat-
ing 1,000,000 people at a pinch, and as this com-
modious building is built on wheels, and can be
driven along by an electrical machine specially
made for the purpose, country towns about to
hold railway opening shivoos would do well to
communicate with Mr. Hunt and secure a lease of
his valuable premises. The next racy notion
Thomas holds Is that he has an action against
Police Magistrate Call, for twenty millions, lor
wrongful imprisonment, and when this is handed
over he intends to give £500 to each of the Mel-
bourne charities, and £3000 to every Church in the
city. After this he intends to buy a steam yacht,
and go all round the world relieving the d< stitute.
For all this, however, Tnomasls remarkably sound
on the goose in some things, and, being asked by
the P.M. what all the trouble was about, ha re-
plied, with a considerable amount of method In
his madness, “You fined me 40s. for being drunk
and disorderly, and you had no earthly right to do
that. Being drunk is not an offence, either legally,
or equitably, or ecclesiastically. I am open to say
you yourself, in your time, have taken many a
bottle of wine, and felt queer after it. If a poor
devil drinks a glass too much and gets drunk he lj
put in gaol, but if a swell gets queer with wine it
does not matter ” Subsequently, Mr. Hunt felt
in a more good-natured humour, and n marked:
“ Rather than have any bother. I will accept your
(Mr. Call’s) cheque for £5000 and say quits, it will
save you an extraordi ary amount of pain and
worry, and all the unpleasantness of having to go
before the Judges And, as yon know, the losing
side pays both nls own and the claimant's bill, you
had better pay it.” Mr. Call acce pted this generous
offer, and then Thomas gave orders to have his
carriage ready in half an hour, in order to convey
him to BucKlngham Palace, where he had an ap-
pointment to dine with the Prince of Wales and
'•ladstone. But the caitiff slaves took him up to
the Yarra Bend, and soaked his head in a tan-pit.
When the Prince and Princess of Wales
were visiting Belvolr C stle, in 1815, they were in
turn requested to contribute to the confession-
book, and “confessed” their favourite likes and
dislikes as foliows:—

Albert Edward. Alexandra.
Belvoir Castle, April 7, 1865.
After this, we think still more of that dear, (rood
little woman, Alexandra, and still less of Albert
Edward. We see that A.E.’s favourite Queen is
Mary Queen of Scots. Victoria isn’t very “ popu-
lar” with him—on account, we suppose, of her
not allowing 1 him to fill up Windsor Castle with
his rowdy friends when Ascot races are on. A B.'s
favourite locality, we notice, Is the “Sandwich
Isles.” Let us hope that he will one day find him-
self there; also that as long as he lives he will get
enough money to allow of his eating “ truffles aux
Perigord ” ad. lib., and that,he will stick like grim
death to his “ favourite occupation ” of “improv-
ing his mind.” It’s quite shocking to tind that we
have been so ignorant. Everyone out here has all
along thought that Albert Edward’s favourite oc-
cupation was something quite different.
The Reverend Byng is still lecturing on his
favourite subject, “ The Recognition of Friends i"
Heaven ” He says that ho is morally certain that
such of us as go there will know each other when
we meet, and volunteers the bold, not to cay
irreverent, statement that his wife and children
are “more to him than Moses and Elias.” Moses
and Elias's troubles! If these fine old Jewish gen-
tlemen, all of the olden time, are anything like
their race on earth, they are probably in possession
of the regalia of half the Gentile saints in heaven-

crownless but harped, and some with neither harp
nor crown but holding pawn-tickets for botn
signed by Moses and Ellas and other eminent
celestial Semitic Arms. There were only hrlf-a-
dozen saints who came fully equipped, and we
subsequently learnt from a passing cherub that
these were Scotch. By the way, Mr. Byng says
that heaven is a material place. He calls it, In tne
language of the Scriptures, a temple—a city—a

tinction ever paid to a medicine. This is not only
the case In this country, but abroad everywhere.
At the New Zealand International Exhibition, 1882,
it received tue magnificent First Prize medal, here
reproduced, together with the Highest Diploma,
tor being, according to critical tests, the best pain-
curing and healing remedy known to mankind.
In this connection a lew testimonials from
foreign lands are given, as an evidence of the
world-wide popularity of St. Jacobs Oil. Thous-
ands of unsolicited testimonial letters, similar to
the following, received from authentic sources in
all sections of the Globe, are on file at our office

At the recent Calcutta International Exhibition
the jurors awarded the gold medal. The English-
man, of the 0th May, commenting on the unparal-
leled success ot 8t. Jacobs Oil, says: “Disclaiming
irreverent tendencies, 8t. Jacobs Oil improves on
acquaintance, and the jurors have, after most
crucial tests, conferred upon it the gold medal.”

has cured me completely ot rheumatic pains, from
which I have been suitering for four years, with-
out relief from any other remedies I had used.
The inlorraation 1 give yYm has for its sole object
the testifying to that which is truly mysterious,

a lew applications.
Calcutta.
“Campbell Hospital, Sealdah, Calcutta, March
16,1884:—Having hoard of the healing and curative
powers of 8t. Jacobs Oil lu cases of sore throats,
pains, &o., and suffering while in this institution
with a sore throat, I obtained the permission of
the medical officers who attended me for small-pox
to use it, and have much pleasure in stating that a
single application gave me much relief, and in
three days, using the oil twice dally, I felt rid of
the sore throat. I have no hesitation in recom-
mending the use of the same to others, and feel
sure they will find the oil give instantaneous re-
lief. I would also here mention that with the sore
throat I had a severe pain in the jaws, which was
removed after only two applications of St. Jacobs
Oil.—(Signed) E. A. Peeeira, Head Inspector of

What Is more to be desired by a young lady than

which will fit her to be an ornament to society
but if she have a sallow countenance, and her face

A young lady In one of our pro-
minent institutions of learning, who
was a gre-at favourite, not only
among her classmates but with all
the faculty, was obliged to give up
her studies and return home seriously
ill. Chronic nervous sick headache,
accompanied by impaired digestion,
by which the circulation and nutri-
tion of the brain was impaired,
rendered her very miserable. A
physician was called, who, apparently
not understanding the nature of her
ailment, failed to afford relief A
friend who had been similarly afflic-
ted, and found immediate relief by
using Emil Frese’s Hamburg Tea,
recommended the same to her. Sne
made trial of it, and, to her great
joy, found a decided improvement as
the result. After a few days’ use of
this popular remedy, she was fully
restored.
A marvel of the age. It Is impos-
sible to say too much in praise of that
good old standard remedy, Emil

vents, as well as cures, skin diseases,

brought on or aggravated by a dis-

More than one member of the Royal
family is now very strong on Spiritualism—a class
nf belief which, as may bo easily imagined by any-
one who has read muih about the mental idiosyn-
crasies of the princes ot the House of Brunswick,
i» calculated to increase rather than to lessen its
hold upon them as time goes by. No one
aaouainted with the rate at which things ha .re
hppn progressing in this direction for some years
past, was at all surprised at the statements made In
Several newspapers that just before and after the
death of the Duke of Albany a very eminent per-
sonage infeed “saw visions,” and that the de-
ceased Duke stited on more than one occasion he
had seen apparitions which warned him of his end.
The Loudon Spiritualists claim that John Brown
was a “ good medium,” and was in communication
with the spirit of the late Prince Consort. How-
ever this may be, one thing Is certain—that the
Duke of Albany was an out-and-out Spiritualist,
and that he was completely under the thumb of
one Eglinton. an individual of the Slade order,
who has long been astonishing private and fash-
ionable circles in London by his "slate-writing
and other performances. You perhaps have heard
of Elkington, and, wishing to test his powers, you
make up a party to visit him at his rooms in Old
Ouebec-street. You bring with you a new folding
slate, which you have just bought. He takes
vour slate, which you have wiped clean in
his presence, and drops between its leaves a
small piece of slate pencil the size of a pin;
then he shuts the slate and holds one corner
of it firmly between his thumb and forefinger.
You hold it by the other corner and middle with
both hands. Presently you hear a scratching
noise, and in a moment or two he asks you to open
the slate, which, you find, Is covered with writing.
How Is it done ? Kglinton says he doesn’t know—
there it is, and that’s all he can tell you about it.
Hundreds of people, including Professor Crookes
(of “radiometer” fame), who investigated the
Katie King affair, leading physicians, and other
scientists have Interviewed Eglinton. and seen his
slate- wilting phenomena, without being able to
say more than that the writing must be produced
bv an unknown force. It is astonishing to find
how many swells of all grades who have been
dabbling in Spiritualism concur in attributing to
Eglinton “ mediumi8tic ,, powers on the basis oi
the phenomena alluded to. Eglinton, who Is a
stoutly-built, heavy-featured, gentlemanly young
fellow, reminds one of Slade in many respects
for he has that arch-humbug’s big dreamy eyes,
listless drawl, and exaggerated insouciance .or
action. A little while before Prince Leopold died
he bought a handsomely-mounted folding slate
with the intention of presenting it to Eglinton,
and, after his decease, the slate was found among
his papers. The writer of tnis has seen a letter
addressed tu Eglinton by the Duke’s secretary
who, a little while since, forwarded to the 1 me-
dium ” the slate aforesaid as a souvenir of the
friendship of His Royal Highness.
Joe and Barney Thompson are in London,
and have obtained a fair position in the betting
ring—whatever that may moan. They won about
£8000 at the Ascot, and dropped—for such is the
fortune of war-about £10,000 on several small
country meetings soon afterwards. The very last
heard of “the Leviathan” is that, on a recent
Sunday morning, hb and one or two other distin-
guished spor s had the honour of escorting down
Petticoat Lane the eminent Mr. John M'BIhone,
M.L.A., who has since remarked that Petticoat-
lane was “ the grandest sight in London, and no-
body should miss seeing it.” The other day, John
got on top of a ’bus and began to swear some. This
attracted the attention of another Horsetrailyan,
who was also sitting on the knlfeboard, and who
instantly remarked, “You come from Australia,
don’t you ?” John promptly owned up that he
did, arid began to describe uis trip over the Denver
and Rio Grande railway, in the course of which he
appears to have met witji the most awful and
blood-curdling series of adventures which ever
befel mortal man. Mr. M‘Kay, a tall, slab-sided,
lean, lantern-jawed Mnrkan gentleman, who, a
little while ago, visited Sydney in the Interests
of the railway named, induced John and his
friends to travel by the Denver and Rio
Grande Instead of by the Union Pacific. For
hundreds of miles, John says, he had to hang on
by his eyebrows while passing over frail bridges,
through marrow-freezing gulches, and canons In
whose horrid depths locomotives rusted and
corpses mouldered. “ You don’t catch me going
any more by tho Denver and Rio Grande,” remarks
John; “no, not for all Europe, Asia, Africa, and
America, with Riverina thrown in. M‘Kay gave
us a big prospectus in San Francisco. It showed
that there were ssventy-three dishes on the bill of
fare, buffalo-hump and all. And, by the political
reputation of John Davies, I swear that tor fitty-
two hours we couldn’t get a bit of tucker. To
print exactly what the bon. member for the Upper
Hunter says about the Rio Grande and Mr. Tom
M’Kay would hardly suit this paper, so a full
account of it will be postponed until Mac returns
and in the Assembly brings to bear upon the Good-
chap and Whitton quarrel his experience of Ame-
rican railway bridges. He is accompanied t>y his
son, a youngster of 15 years, who is so ’cute that
in the absence of his father he can at any time bo
entrusted with the expenditure at a hide and
tallow sale ot a few thousands of pounds. Mac
was interviewed at Denver by a newspaper man,
who printed in his paper a column account ot the
corrobboree ; and at another town further on
a couple of columns of the opinions of the Mar-
quis of Normauby on things in general were pub-
lished by a newspaper man who didn’t speak to or
even see the Marquis at all. Next day six press-
men filed up to interview His Excellency, who.
however, declined to see them on the ground of
the aforesaid invention by the editor of their con-
temporary, wbom they accordingly proceeded to
abuse. But that gentleman retorted that they
were telling a tissue of impudent lies merely
through jealousy.
Lord Tennyson once remarked, in a man-
ner that did credit to his discrimination, that Love
may come and Love may go, and fly like a bird
from tree to tree. Hans Peter Hansen, a middie-
aged Cupid residing in Auckland, N.Z., was either
much struck with this observation, or arrived at a
similar conclusion by a process of original ratio-
cination. He bad been six months married to a
young woman twenty years old, when he deter-
mined to fly with Another. They flew. The Other
left three children and a husband behind her in her
hurry; but one cannot be expected to remember
everything at such times. Her fourth olive branch
she took with her. They flew to Nelson, and there
—in the very height of their billing and cooing—
Hans Peter was limed. Limed by a constable. He
was brought back with his wings frayed and torn —
a most unsprightly vision. The Other, faithful to
the last, wont with him. They were met ou the
pier at Onehunga by the young woman of twenty,
who immediately charged upon the other with
much spirit, and would probably have caterpillared
her if the Force had not interposed. The three
were finally got into a railway carriage amid the
cheers of an admiring crowd. Here there was an-
other skirmish between the two rivals. They were
again separated. The young woman of twenty
then developed an intention to mingle herself
with the wheels of the train, and had thrown open
the door of the carriage and cast at her husband a
last despairing look, which seemed to move him
about as much as if ho had been an india-rubber
buffer, when the constar/le caught her by the
skirtsand unromantically plumped her down injher
seat again. When the party got to the end of their
Journey, Hans was conveyed to the police station,
whither he was followed by the young woman
who had had designs upon herself. By this time
she had become conscious of her wicked and fool-
ish conduct la attempting to interfere with the
happiness of her husband, and had apologised for
the same, and begged permission to lie outside his
door all night. The keeper or the look-up was too
tender-hearted to allow her to do this, so she was
shut up in a cell by herself on a charge of at-
tempted suicide. Here she became hysterical, and
would not be comforted until he went to Hans
Peter, and asked him to call over to her from his
cell—which he did, adding an expletive or two
winch seemed to soothe her considerably. The
Other would have also accompanied Hans Peter to
the police-station if she had been allowed to. but
she was not, neither did the husband she had left
behind in her hurry manifest any sign of having
missed her. What is to be the end of this little
romance we don’t know, but if Hans is to be
returned to the young woman who wished to
make a corse of herself on his account, we shall be
surprised if he doesn’t give her the opportunity
to repeat the experiment with more success before
very long. Themost curious—ifitiscurious at all.
which we are not by sny means sure of-part of
the affair is that Hansen is a tow-headed Dane, as
homely-looking as a Dutch oven, and both of the
women are more than passably pretty. If plain
men can exercise such a fascination as this over
the; sex, what hearts may not a man break who is
both clean and distinguished-looking? We have
often put this question to the partner of our beer,
but she has never exhibited any alarm. She was
always noted for her courage from the time she
was a child.
A Pall Mall Gazette man has inter-
viewed the Messrs. Tussaud, who oarry on the
celebrated business of their late mother, Madame
Tussand, whose wax-works ate now being re-
moved to new and enormous premises. Mr. Victor
Tussaud told his visitor that “we always And
after a thrilling murder, when a wave of horror
has swept through the country and stirred up the
morbid bile in a thousand stomachs (the stomach
is the seat of the disease), that the business of the
chamber of Horrera increases enormously.” The
apple of the eye of the Tussand family Is a wax
model of the face of Robespierre beneatb a glass
case—a wonderful piece of workmanship, worthy
of the hand that shaped it. Robespierre went to
the guillotine with his broken jaw swathed in a
white linen cloth. An hour after the knife fell
Mdme. Tussaud, unshrinking, plied her ghastly
trade, took his head In her lap and made the cast
which is now shown—an historical relic, of which
the brothers Tussaud are Justifiably proud. There
is /tlie model of Marat in bis bath, which brave
Mdme Tussaud took with her own hands. “ They
came for me,” she says, “ to go to the house where
Marat lived, for the purpose of making a cast of
his features, for he had Just been killed by Char-
lotte Corday. He was still warm, and his bleeding
body and the cadaverous aspect of the Ucnd made
me feel desperately sick, but I had to perform the
task.” Marat’s model lies in the very bath in
which he was murdered. The guillotine which has
divided the arteries of 20,000 unfortunates is on
view. The Tussauds do not, we read, now-adays,
have any sittings from murderers Some of the
casts shown have been taken after execution, or
from sketches in tne condemned cell; but now-a-
days sketches and notes are made at the trial.
Here is a captital story told to the interviewer:—
“Caloraft I had not the pleasure of knowing; but
Marwood, now—why. Marwood has often sat in
this very chair,” said Mr. Tussand, putting his hand
on the chair in which I was resting for a moment.
This was an unexpected Joy. “Poor Marwood I
he’s gone now. He would come here when bis
spirits wero low. A pipe and a glass of gin-and-
water—his favourite vanity—were always at his
service. Then he would go down to seo some of
his old acquaintances around whose necks he had
so delicately adjusted the fatal noose, whose bodies
he had sent whisking Into space. It was quite
pathetic. He would stop before each one with a
grim smile. His lips moved tremulously as he
summoned up some pleasant thought. * Put me
there,’ he once said, after he had given us a sitting
on his own account. It was like a man choosing
the site of his own grave. His companion on these
visits was a grizzled terrier. One day he came
alone. ‘Your dog, Mr. Marwood, where is it?
The old man was sad. : My poor old dog is dying.
My dog that knew the business like a Christian
and the inside of every prison in England, who has
played with my ropes, who has caught rats in my
business bags.’ ‘ Dying by inches ?' I said; * why
don’t you hang him?’ Marwood gave me a long
reproachful glance. ‘No, no! Hang a man. But
my dear old dog, never.’ Poor old Marwood, he’d
a good heart." The story of tho old hangman and
his dog was so affecting that tho interview ended
abruptly. When the wax figures were removed,
they did not, it would seem, procesh “in Indian
file, at dead of night, when the silver moon was
shining bright,” but by a much more prosaic mode
—la vans!
We have lost the last of our illusions. We
have been visionaries, but that Is all over now.
There are raoie fatuous members of Parliament in
Q .ecnsland than we’ve got. We resign the bolt on
behalf of—there are so many of them that it would
be Invidious to particularise—to Mr. John Annear,
the junior member for Maryborough. This gentle-
man has, by one effort, distanced all competitors
and put himself beyond the pale of rivalry for-
evermore. How did he accomplish this ? He
accomplished it by aspeech he delivered in Gympie
a week or two, or maybe three, ago. Such an
oration as he delivered there had never gladdened
the ears of the electors of Gympie before. Ho
began by an invocation to the patriotic spirit of
his hearers, then he dropped easily, and gracefully,
down to the railway question, which reminded Dim
—as it naturally would—that he had travelh d the
previous night in the same carriage with Mr.
Taylor of the Stray Leaves Company, and this
caused him to say such intelligence as he saw
before him—(cheers)—would, he was sure, grace
that show with its presence. (Derisive laughter
and eggs.) The honorable member then, by an
easy transition, passed to the timber question, and
proved that he grasped it in all its phases by volun-
tarily stating that he had once been a
and hoped he would be a boiler-maker again—a
sentiment which was received with deafening
applause. This led him to modestly observe that
he was a most humble man, with the qualification
that there were gentlemen by nature, and that he
hoped he was one of them. After a brief reference
to certain physiological curiosities with bumps of
self esteem as big as th«ir heads, whom he said he
had seen with his own eyes, he touched lightly ou
the stamp duty, complimented the Town Council,
claimed acquaintanceship with several persons
present (none of whom betrayed anv agitation to
respond to the claim, except one old gentleman,
—surmised to be in a condition of drink—who was
promptly ejected), and wound up by a bold diplo-
matic stroke to the effect that “the conduct of
the people of Qymple told him the lock-up was
unnecessary,” and some lines of poetry strongly
suspected to be his own. Inspired by the success
of this speech, a kindred spirit got up and in-
formed the audience that he had been the last man
to shake hands with the other member for Mary-
borough, and commenced to tell a joke he (the
speaker) had made upon that occasion, the point
of which was lost to posterity by a person behind
him summarily crushing his hat over his eyes.
Not daunted by this example, two other gentle-
men rose up together and congratulated Mr.
Annear upon his success; whereupon that versa-
tile orator again got upon fyis legs and said. In a
voice trembling with emotion, that that indeed
wasa night worth livlngfor, andthat—so much was
he touched with the generous reception they had
given him—the poorest there would do him proud
by writing a letter to him and addressing it to the
House of Parliament—an invitation which was
greeted with much cheering of a scornful nature.
A voice in the audience then manifested some
curiosity about his position with regard to the
Kanaka question. This matter he soon set at rest
by stating that he kept a little Kanaka girl at his
home as an adopted child. His llnal words were
to the effect that that noble book, “ Comngsby,”
had won for him his election, and would doubly
win it next time, and that the men of Gympie
should buy it. Mr. Annear then got down from
the platform, and invited the crowd to come and
drink with him, which tne crowd did like one man.
Thus genially concluded one of the most panto-
mimic political meetings ever held this side of the
line. We have nobody to compete with Mr. An-
noar in his own particular line. Angus Cameron
is well enough in his way, and so are many more
in theirs, put there is not that fine element of
originality in their absurdity which there is in Mr.
Annear’s. As we said before, he wears the belt.

Tawhaiao has been suffering from tooth-
ache. A man cannot in his youth use his jaws to
crack up the devilled bones of his enemies without
suffering for it some day Parson Uutledge, of
Tarnworth, has been holding forth on “Lazy
Christians a topic on which the cleric is always
completely at home, since all he has to do to se-
cure the fullest information on the subject is to
look into his heart and describe accurately what
he sees therein “Your hair’s on tire I” shouted
a boy to his red-headed schoolfellow. “ You can
put it out, then,” was the reply; “you have water
on the brain.”. . Honniker Heaton will be much
disappointed if there is no one in New South
Wales willing to plank down £30 for the purchase
of certain singular old Australian mementos he
has unearthed in London. He himself, he says, is
tired of giviag. Why doesn’t he canvas for the
needful amongst the many N.8.W. absentees who
are doing the grand in the mother land?... They
had to get a Tarnworth warder to flog the prisoner
Bridget at Newcastle. Not a turnkey in East
Maitland gaol would have anything to do with it.
None were in want of the fee; each presumably
having a Bridget ’gin his own door.
Gallant, who took the Queen's Prize at
Wimbledon this year, is a barber. He ought to
bo a dead shot with a hair gun... According to one
authority, Mrs. Langtry took £3000 as her share for
two weeks' playing in San Francsco— The Earl
of Wemyss proposed a compromise in the Lords,
who now find themselves between Womyss and
abyss Mrs. Langtry’s mother, Mrs. Le Breton,
accompanied her to America. The Jersey Lily is
now again in England. Apropos, her father, the
Dean of Jersey, is described as having been in his
time a very gay old boy, indeed—and it would
really seem to be so, judging from the character
of tlie quarrels he has had with his ecclesiastical
superiors It is well-known, remarks a London
paper, that Cornwall, the ex-Secretary of the
Dublin Post Ollice, had made himself obnoxious
to the ParnellltaJparty by reporting partisan post-
masters and employes Mr. James Gordon Ben-
nett is going to build a big hotel, “ on the Ameri-
can principle,” in London — Thus a leading Paris
journal: “M. Ferry, who in the art of downright
lying, surpasses all preceding Ministers, whether
of ine empire or the monarchy,” &o, &c. To be
the greatest liar of a century of liars is no little
matter. William has gone down to posterity as
“ the Silent;” Louis, as “ the Fat;” why not “Ferry
the Liar?” Doctor Koch, who is announcing
himself as the discoverer of the cholera germ, la a
diminutive weazened-face man of forty, who looks
like sixty. It is widely suspected that the doctor
is himself the discovered germ. At any rate, he is
a German..,.The Rev. J. S. Watson, who died re-
cently in England, while undergoing a sentence of
penal servitude for the murder of his wife, was
the author of a Life of Person, a Life of Wilkes,
and a Life of Cobbett. He executed a number of
the translations i'< Bohn’s “Classical Library.”
Thus Truth:— “The expeditions to England of
the Crown Princess of Germany have not been
frequent of late years. When H.R.H. was here in
187S she resented the ascendency of the late John
Brown, and freely expressed her sentiments on the
subject of ‘the Highlauder’ to the Queen, who
was exceedingly angry. A iew months later the
German Empress came to England on a visit to
the Queen, which excited much gossip at the lime,
the real object of the visit bei; g an attempt to
bring about a reconciliation between Her Majesty
and her eldest daughter.” Princess Louise is to
model the statue of the Queen to be placed in Lin-
coln Cathedral. Her Majesty insists that the
material shall not be marble but bronze, as she
wishes to be as near Brown as possible. ..William
Morris, speaking of Millais, the idol of the blatant
plutocracy, says that his record is that of a ruined
reputation, of a wasted life, of a genius bought
and sold and thrown away.

Title, Torrens’ Act.
The question is now frequently asked, 1 Where
is Queenscliff ? ”
Queenscliff comprises the whole of the line un-
dulating range across the Curl Curl Lagoon, ex-
tending from the ocean to the old Plttwater-road,
which overlooks the whole of the town of Manly
and the lower portion of Sydney Harbour.
It is difficult to Imagine any spot so well suited
for the Marine Suburb of a large city as Manly,
possessing a splendid Beaon on the shores of the
Harbour, approachable from the city by smooth
water all the way, while within Jess than a quarter
of a mile from the steamers’ wharf is the grand
ocean beach nearly a mile in length, fronting
which, abtut I5j feet back, are numerous tine
bouses extending the greater part of the distance.
The most charming spots in Manly for Villa
Sites are the hills to the North, and South Clifton
Heights to the South are being rapidly built over,
and it will be a difficult matter in the course of a
few years to secure a decent sized piece of ground.
Queenscliff bounds Manly to the North, and ex-
tends to the beautifully shelly beach of Fresh-
water, which has been dedicated lor public re-
creation.
It is within easy walking distance across the new
foot bridge of the Manly wharf, and commands
LAND and OCEAN VIEWS unequalled near
Sydney, and the villa sites are beyonu all question
the finest in the neighbourhood. They vary In
depth from 150 to 4b0 feet, and those fronting* the
Lagoon have water frontages suitable for bathing-
houses.
English estates have special values In conse-
quence of there being good shooting about, and
there should be good shooting in this locality;
there is certainly good Ashing out at sea and "in
Curl Cu>l Lagoon. Rabbits ana hares may be
abundant, but the auctioneers cannot vouch for
the fact; and as for foxes, there is a whole family
at Manly, but it would be dangerous to attempt
to shoot any one of them.
This superb Estate will be sold on the ground, on
SATURDAY AFTERNoON, September20,
at 3.30.

ORIENTAL GOLD
Is the latest discovery of Sclenoe and the grandest
achievement of the alchemist's art. It looks like
gold, it is as heavy as gold, and ltl« more enduring.
None but an expert can detect the difference, and
then only by the severest tests. Ornaments made
Irorn this now composition are equal in design and
gem ral appearance to those made of the finest
18-carat gold, and yet we sell them at but a tithe of
the Cost of the genuine goods.
Kernembcr that we do not pretend that Oriental
Gold is any thing but a composition of pure metals;
but we do affirm that it is so perfect an imitation
of the sterling golu as to almost defy detection.
Jewellery made of it may be worn anywhere, and
the closest inspection will only strengthen the con-
viction that it is real gold. So perfect is it, and so
large has our trad a become, that jewellers through-
out the colonies are complaining of the dullness
in trade, and are constantly writing to us to secure
our goods for their own customers. Hut as wo are
Solo Agents for these colonies, we prefer to deal
directly with the public. All of our Oriental Gold
Jewellery is made to our order, and is stamped
with our trade mark. You can order anything
from a Scarf Pin to a Watch and Chain, and it will
bo sent Post Free, and at our risk, on receipt of
price.
SPECIALLY OBSERVE.
Should you bo dissatisfied with your investment
after Inspecting the articles, re-pack them at once
and send them back to us. If this is done within
two days—or where mails are few, by the first post
after receipt, and the articles are not injured—wo
will return the money, deducting only the trifle
expended on postage. You can keep any one
article and return the rest, and we will refund the
money for the articles not retained. Fair dealing
is our motto, and we bind ourselves to give satis-
faction. Examine our catalogue, and send in your
order for what you may require.
N.B — We find that, through an error on the part
of the manufacturers, we are overstocked with
Brooches, and for the purpose of making a rapid
clearance of that line of Goods, wo will send to
any customer (post free, if at a distance) on receipt
of Five Shillings (5s ), a really exquisite Oriental
Hold Brooch, equal in design, finish, and appear-
ance to a Five Guinea Brooch of the sterling’ metal.
This offer holds good for a few weeks only, and is
made as much for the purpose of advertising our
Oriental Jewellery by sample as for any other
reason ; for tho Brooches will keep, and they are

SUNDRY SHOWS.
theatre Royal— “The Merry Duchess”. ...p. 8.
Gaiety Theatre—“The Philanthropist”.... lb.
Opera House—“School for Scandal ib.
Academy or Music—Federal Minstrels ib.
Last Saturday we went to the Gaiety to
see George Forbes’ new comedy, “ The Philanthro-
pist.” And now you will want to know what the
niece was like. You expect us to “slate” it, of
course, for we are always putting George away;
but we’re going to surprise you this time, and
after your hair grows out again you may come
around and thank us. We like “ The Philanthro-
pist." It is not the brightest play ever written,
and it needs some “fakeing” to make it a long-
running piece; but it is a lot better than many
comedies th-Jt wc have seen put on the stage. We
are rather glad to say this about George Forbes,
for we have so frequently found him “ a duffer at
play,” and honesty has compelled us to siy so.
Dur heart Is always under our left waistcoat-
pocket, and we would rather do good than evil.
You can’t guess, however, wnat fun It is to have a
subject like George Forbes. You know he is pretty
W eil braced up so far as his family and social rela-
tions are concerned, and that he plays, not for a
living, but because be likes it. It does our soul good
to get hold of a professional like George, because
you know he can stand It. We are not in the habit
of smoothing anybody over, but we can tell you
that il George Forbes was placing for bread and
putter we might treat him with Jess nonsense or
leave him alone altogether. And that would kill
him.
* » •
The reason we like “The Philanthropist”
is because it is an “ even ” play, as the dally papers
have told you. Georae can’t act a little t it, out
we must confess that he has a good command of
language and an appreciation of dramatic situa-
tions that he must have acquired from his step-
mother’s slipper. There is one striking thing about
•• The Philanthropist,” whicn is that it has a plot
in it. We have been to several original things at
the Gaiety, but, so heln us, Moses, thii is the first
one we have seen with any plot. And, come to
think of it, there isn’t plot enough about this one
to hurt anybody’s head. Wybert Keeve (what a
pretty name Wybert is, now that it occurs to us)
plays in the title role. The Philanthropist is a sort
of Don Quixote, who goes about straightening up
all family difficulties the same way the Spanish
knight demolished.the windmill. He brings lovers
together (just at the wrong time), and makes the
young fellow feel just as though he had to ask the
old man for his daughter. Perhaps you don't know
how that feels. Well, we do; and if you believe
what we say, you’ll never want to feel it but once
In a lifetime.
♦ ♦ *
Wo rather liked Wybert Reeve as the
Philanthropist, There was just a suggestion of
Count Fosco about him at the first, but this wore
away, and presently he came out with both ears
up and his hair parted in the middle. And this
reminds us of the time we were iu Patagonia, and
the natives were so dangerous. In those days we
had to sleep with one eye open, and thus we
learned to part our hair in the middle like J.
Walter Scott does his name. Often have we
wondered where Wybert got his conception of
characters. Sometimes we have thought that he
got it from contemplating Coleman's nose, for it
is so confoundedly crooked that you can’t look at
it without getting your system mixed; but the
way he plays In this new makes us think
tbat he must have slept with his mouth open and
the wind blew some sense (artistic sense, we mean)
Into him. Wybert will be cross when he sees
these lines, but after a while it Will begin to dawn
on him that we’re not writing just to please him.
• • •
This is a funny world, anyway, and you
can’t have everything just as you want it. And
this brings to our recollection the chum we once
had over in the Kocay Mountains. He was one of
those men you have read about. He would peel
his coat anywhere for his friend, and he never
knew when he was licked. One day be was all
alone up on tne Taylor river, when a cinnamon
hear came at him. The only weapon he had about
him was a pocket-knife, with a catch spring, that
he had used for months to open tins of salmon,
green corn, etc. ile pulled out the knife and
yelled, but the bear came ou just as hard, and we
hanpen to know that he would have given seven
million dollars to be out ot that neighbourhood.
First he swore a little, and then he began to pi ay,
but the Lord didn’t seem to listen at all. Finally,
as the ferocious brute drew nearer, he sang out: -
“ Oh, Lord 1 If it’s agin yer principles to h<dp me,
don't help that bar. Jest stand by, an’ y’H see the
gol-darndest flgh ; ye ever hear tell on.” We didn’t
see the encounter, but when our mate came home
with bear’s claws dangling at his belt we knew
that he’d been where our hair would have turn d
white In one night.
* * *
Harry Leston is in the cast, but he might
as well be clear of it, for the part he has smothers
him entirely, and he h.sn’t a chance to act a little
bit. Edwin Palmer plays Mr. Charles Poynter, and
you’ll guess at ouce what kind of an old snoozer he
is when we quote the classic language of the pro-
gramme: “Mr Charles Poynter, Mrs Pointers
husband.” That’s about all the distinction to
which a lot of men ever come, and after ad, it
doesn’t seem such a smkll idea. There are a lot of
men who couldn’t be houest husoands if they
wanted to, and a lot more who are such confounded
fools that they think they’re too sharp to get mar-
ried. We ouce hoard Bob Ingergsoli say that the
man who had the love of one pure, good woman,
was, or oui-ht to bo, the proudest and happiest
man on earth. He seemed to regard it as a sort of
compliment to a man to have a woman love him;
and yet he is only a freethinker and next door to
an atheist.
* * *
Maggie Knight came back to us in “The
Philanthropist,” and she sang a song. Wo don’t
remember the name of the lay, but it was ever so
prettily rendered. We didn’t know before that
Maggie could sing, but we know it now, and when
we want to male a our pet canary shut its head
we’ll threaten it with ner. George Forbes (Mr.
George Forbes we ought to say, perhaps, since he’s
risen to the dignity of a playwrighti has cast him-
self as an aesthetic poet, who is always talking
Jove like a jackass to people who haven’t a par-
ticle of sentiment about them. There are a lot of
other people ui the piece that one would like to
tell you about, but Grattan Riggs has just dropped
in and upaei. our Ideas of things. By the way,
Grattan left with his company for Brisbane last
Monday, and we’ll bet a thousand dollars that he'll
do well In Queensland. Jimmy Macmahon is still
engineering the outfit, and what he doesn’t knowi
about the show business isn’t hardly worth learning
But we’ve stayed long enough at the Gaiety. Take
our word for it, and go to see George Forbes’
play. It’s always right to encourage home talent,
but aside from that, “Tne Philanthropist ” has iu-
trinuc merit that you’ll recognise rignt away.
♦ » • *
Of course you are wondering why we
didn’t tell you something about Marie De Grey to
start with. The reason we didn’t open out that
way was that we preferred to tell j ou about
George Forbes’ new play. It was on our mind,
ana we coulo’nt get li off while the memory of a
few baptismal cock-tails lingered on our breath.
Now, however, we are going to tell you about
Miss De Grey,, and if you don’t go to see her you’ll
make a bivger mistake than the woman who burnt
a hole in her apron. We are sorry that Miss De
Grey came to us in the “ School for Scandal ’’—not
because it's a bad play, but because the little
woman hadn’t the success she deserved in Adelaide
ana Melbourne. The “School lor Scandal” is a
good enough play—in fact, is one of the best of
the standard English comedies; but Lady Teazle is
hardly the character in which a star ougdt to ap-
pear tor the flr-t time. No difference how well
she may play the character, it isn’t prominent
enough for an introduction piece. Miss De Grey
is a very fair actress, scarcely the least bit stagey,
end moat ot the time so natural that you would
think she was born that wpy.
You know all about the plot of “ The
School for Scandal,” and, of course, don’t want
us to tell you anything about it. We might tell
you, though, that It’s not a bad outfit that’s playing
at tne Opera House. Tbey are called the London
Comedy Company, we believe, and are run by
Allison. Amongst the lot there are some fair
art'sts, and, when we name them, yon won’t know
them from Adam because they are strangers in the
colonies. Some of them are not so strange, but
there are a few to whom you will need to be ictro-
duced. There is A. T. Hilton. J. P. West. Matthew
Brodie, Mort Selton, Mark Kingborne, Mrs. Chip-
pendale, Grace Otway, and a few others that you
don’t know much about, but will learn to admire,
perhaps, as the months roll by. You have heard
of Mrs. Chippendale many a time, no doubt, for
she has a London reputation that many an actress
envies. And you ought to see her play Mrs. Can-
dour. Not that it is a difficult role at all, but still
it takes mighty good acting to put It out the way
that Mrs. Chippendale does. But we are not going
to stay any longer at the Opera House, for the
“devil” is yelling “copy,” and -anyway, we want
to look In on "The Merry Duchess ” at the Royal
for a minute or two.
* * * *
Yon haven’t been to seo “The Merry
Duchess?” Well, that’s wrong of you. The first
thing you know the Governor or we will be out
some nl/ht, and you’ll miss an opportunity to get
into distinguished company. Oh, yesl and this
reminds us that the Governor was out at the
Gaiety last Saturday night. The dear old buzzard
kept the audience waiting as usual, and the cur-
tain was late going up. But when ho did come in and
enter the leu box the people rose like one man.
Tne height of enthusiasm wasn't reached, how-
ever, until his royal nibs stuck his beak out from
behind the curtain and let the audience look at it.
We were glad to witness this demonstration, fur
Lord Loft us has so often aistinguishfd himself on
the field of battle and In the realms of litera-
ture. Everybody knows, from public annals,
ail about bis army record, apd how he did
valiant service for his country in many a hot
campaign. Everybody knows, too, how he has
distinguished himself la the world of letters. As
a philosopher, only a few men can approach him.
Therefore, it is mete and right that the populace
should rise and stand uaboaaetted when the dis-
tinguished orator, statesman, and soldier enters.
[If you were as good at paying your debts as you
are at using sarcasm, you wouldn’t have thq
bailiffs after you all the time.—Ed. B.]
♦ f ♦
“ The Merry Duchess ” is a very entertain-
ing opera. We have listened to more brilliant
music in our time, and have seen operas that had
more “catchy” airs scattered through them. In
fact, the only “catchy ” thing about “The Merry
Duchess ” is the tiger song, which is sung by half-
a-dozen small boys in boots and breeches.
Musicians growl at the piece because their
liver won’t be satisfied with anything short of
high-olass symphonies. Actors like the piece be-
cause it affords first-rate opportunities for act ng;
and we like it because It amuses us, and we don’t
know one note from another. The only thing we
ever learned to play was a solo on a fog-horn, and
the people who heard us seemed to think that wo
“discorded” tLat. You can’t imagine what fun
wo have with ourselves when we sit down to
criticise an opera, we know so little about music
that our mind wanders back to the days when we
used to stuff fire-crackers up a sleeping pig’s nose,
and then touch theim off just to see the fun. But
away with dull care. Now we are going to the
Miustrels.
• * * *
In the first place, we’re going to tell you
that Colonel Hlsoocks has been ill for more than a
week. We are not exactly sure what made him
sick, but wo are satisfied that it was one of two
things. It might be that Hussey’s old jokes
paralysed him, but the stronger probability is tbat
our neglect to i oiioe his show last week is what
ails him. Wo told you some time ago that when
we kept oar head shut about any place of amuse-
ment its patronage fell off. Maybe you didn’t be-
lieve us, out you just ought to see how the middle
of the house has fallen out of the Minstrels. The
entertainment is just as funny as ever. and. if you
take our tip lorDt, you’ll go to see the Minstrels.
They’re not going right away, to bo sure, but
thi.y’re not going to stay for ever, and you ought
to be making hay.
* * * *
We would like to tell you what we think
of Woodyear’s circus, but the truth is we haven't
had time to get there. We’ve heard people speak
well of It, however, and you’d better chance It.
We’re going out some evening this week, and
next week we’ll tell you all about it. Until then,
adieu.
" THE POOR PLAYER.”
[Correspondence is invited from members of the
Theatrical Profession.]
Professor Carl, a “ deaf and dumb exhibi-
tor.” gave ao entertainment founded on Dickens’s
“ Old Curiosity Shop,” in Hamilton recently. Tbo
Professor was eloquent in the person of an active
assistant; but gave all bissuporiorgagstothe audi-
ence with a magic-lantern and a sheet—And New
Zealand is lively, let us tell you, with grand concerts
at Kaitanga (“under the auspices of the brass
band”), and a grand success for Mrs. Thomson,
who fascinated the audience with *■ Barney O’Hea.”
A feeling of gloom, however, was noticed to come
over the audience when the chairman announced
that the proceeds of the concert would just suffice
to buy “two new instruments” for the brazen
performers —And let us ring out that Georgie
Smithson has migrated to Dunedin ; and that
“ Professor Anderson, who has been lost sight ot
since he finished his Northern trip, opened for a
short season at Sloan's Theatre, Invercargill, on
August 13.” A statement we should like the
Canterbury Times to explain! And the Papanui
Amateurs have been doing Gilbert’s “The Wed-
ding March ” (“ Lo Chapeau do Faille d’ltalie,” in
which both the Marshalls, poor fellows! were so
good). Further than this, on the last night of the
Dunning crowd at Auckland, Miss Ivanova fainted
twice, and her Indisposition, was feelingly an-
nounced to the audience by Mr. George Dean, the
stage-manager. A local paper—which means well
—says, “The audience departed evidently more
concerned at the illness of the courageous prima
donna than at the abrupt abbreviation' of
the performance which it entailed.” And
talking of Dunning’s crowd rem nds us that
Agnes Consuelo (whom they once tried, with dis-
mal results, to put up in “Boccaccio. ’ the title role,
is only placing little leg pans in “Uhilpdric,” at
the London Umpire; and furthermore they say
that amongst Mr. Dunning’s company is a terrible
masher, who, a paper s tys, “goes by the soubri-
quet of ‘ Handsome George,’ and who enquires
for letters thus addressed to himself at the post-
office.” This kind of thing mates one tired of
being a man, and wish to be a penguin Curi-
ously enough, the New Zealand papers seem to
laud this conduct on the part of air. George Dean.
It seems Mr. Dunning’s religious opera company
gave a sacred concert one Sunday, and there was a
collection. Two gentlemen in the dress-circle,
probably thinking the entertainment was not
worth any more, gave a penny each to the “ chief
robber ’ when became round. But read:—“The
collector, however, had caught sight of the contri-
buted coins, and extracting them from the box, he
held them in full view of the ‘house,’ which
promptly concentrated its attention upon the gen-
erous gallants. To complete their discomfiture,
Mr. Lean then gracefully tendered the Cuius to the
abashed donors, and as ihey seemed reluctant to
confess the ownership, the plebeian tokens were
contemptuously tossed towards the wall. Subse-
quently. Mr. Dean announced that the receipts
would not recoup the expense involved by tne
concert.” The vexed questions, in Australia, as
to giving what you choose at a collection enter-
tainment, and hissing when you are dissatisfied,
should be quickly decided. Let a man, for in-
stance, even hiss Maggie Moore’s singing (not
Maggie Moore) in the second act of “ The
Mascotte.” and see how he would be “ biffed
out.”—Oh I and—you’d hardly believe It. would
you?—but the Lynches are coming back with their
infernal bells, They are at present in Batavia, and
the youngest Lynch is so unwell that the doctor
(who reminds us of Dr. Wosky, in "The Boarding
House”) recommends an immediate return to
Australia ...And. in alluding to Fred. Marshall, a
rather clumsy Melbourne correspondent to a New
Zealand pmer siys:—“ Within a comparative'y
short time he has lost his money, his reason, his
wife, and his brother. As Sam Weller would say,
‘a regular staggerer.’” Sam Weller uever mid
anytning of the kind. That is the gag that George
Darrell’s impossible lawyer used to “ have ” the

of Bland Holt is drawing nigh, with the

nolds, who is en route from London, with
Kate Bishop; also “ In the Ranks,” “Called Back,”
and “Falka” and “Nell Gwynne,” comic operas.
Kate Bishop’s brother, Alfred, is a member of Mr.
and Mrs. German Reed’s company, who play,
either In theatternoon or evening, in London all
the year round, at the St. George’s Hall. Kate
Bishop is a tall, fine-looking woman- or was. But
now she’s coming to Australia, perhaps-but who

anynody dare hint that Mr. luglis didn’t lecture,
on “The Scotland of our Granofathers,” in the
king'dom of Whereat, they lie basely and ma-
liciously. We should like to have been In Tenter-
field, to have heard that discourse. Mr. Inglis s
remarks on the subject of our Scottish grand-
tatheis and the milestones, wore, we understand,
of an eloquent and interesting nature. Nothing
daunted, xdr. Inglis lectured against St. Leon’s
circus: though whether he shut up the tent or
not, we are unable to authoritatively set forth. Wo
expect so. Nobody seemed to want to let that
circus have a show at Tenterfleld, it seems, be-
cause Duncan Maccallum was playing his opera
company against it, too. In that company we see
that now Miss Lily Boleyn plajs Aurora in
“Uircfie.” We are glad to see this little Lily
Boleyn going along so nicely. The amateurs were
to the fore on the departure of the tune-
ful push, and when Miss Penny touched
the Bord gently it, was generally considered in
Tenterfleld that there was the true ring about her.
We are surprised to find Tenterfleld so gay. They
are splendid people up there—for staying at home.
.... Brisbane is to have her Potts fust, and her Riggs

Holloways, the Era says of the last night of their
appearance, “The success of the farcical comedy
of ‘His Last Legs’ indicated very clearly bow
popular a short season of good comedy would
have been here, instead of the interminable season
of heavy melodrama”—a revelation just too l«te;
and the same rather captious party Is annoyed be-
cause Bill calls creme de la crime “ krenim dler
krem,” and Fontainebleau “ Fontenbloo.” He is
particular, this party. The sort of man who
would require a Circassian slave to take the beards
off his oysters. Miss Essie Jenyns seems, though,
to have rather enslaved the Era man. See how

“ BONNIE BEATRICE.
“ Shakespeare ‘ About Nothing ’ made ‘ Much Ado,’
And made it bright and merry;
But here ‘about nothing ’ would be untrue,
For it’s * much ado ’ about Essie.”

sir, chimes?

“Gold help us! it is a world to see,” and
when the age is in the wit is out, for a dead cer-
tainty. Speaking on the small-pox scare, the
Sydney Morning Muddle, with its usual per-
spicacity, says: “On the subject of Chinese clean-
liness, it may be added that one of the best-known
doctors in Sydney declares that the Chinese houses
in Lower George-street are cleanliness themselv es,
and that, in fact, the sanitary state of the mer-
chants’ quarter appeared to be higher than in some
fashionable parts of the city.” And, in support of
his truth-squelching statement, Granny declares
It must bd true, because, the much-known medico
“ has not only professionally visited several
Chinese houses In George-street North, but he is
a property owner in the said locality, and his ex-
perience of Chinese tenants has been uniformly
good.” Greed, greed, greed! And wo verily be-
lieve that even Hades itself would get a line re-
commending it as a pleasant summer retreat, if
some of the Old Girl’s cronies had a pecuniary in-
terest in that sultry district.

While the entire population of New South
Wales—except the portion that lost—was hurrah-

Beach, the inhabitants of Churchville, in Queens-

between Langlo and the Minnie Downs, and Yel-

best tracker in the world, was engaged along with
Billy to find them. They were bitter rivals, were
Billy and Yellow Tommy, and great interest, even

Billy won, and now wears the belt. Yellow Tommy

There was a shower of worms in dunes

The only literally guileless Chinaman now
living dwells in Wilcaunia. He was sent some
time ago about ten miles out of the town, to serve
a summons on another Chinaman whose very pig-
tail was instinct with guile. The innocent wor-
shipper of wooden gods went out on foot, and re-
turned on foot —with the summons in his pocket.
When he was asked why he had not delivered 115

Oscar Wilde has much to answer for. The
word icsthetic, which he has made so popular, will
lie heavy on his soul one of these days. It has
come to this that a man who cleans his teeth and
changes his linen more than once a week is now
called an aesthete, and scorned by all his fellows in
the towns of the western interior. A person who
defies popular opinion to the extent of paring his
nails is called a dude, and has to pay for his own

The godly of Auckland (N.Z.) have suc-

for. Why should a feeble creature in gown and

money for making men irreligious and women
narrow-minded and children wretched, while

Here is a statistical item that has been go-
ing the rounds of the country papers:—“In the
city of Glasgow, with its half-million of popula-
tlon, 41 families out of every 100 live in a single
room, and a large number of these families have
a father, mother, six or seven children, and several
lodgers.” Forty-one families living in a single
room is just a trifle too much of condensation. Or,
if only one family is meant, and it consists of a
father, mother, six or seven children, and several
lodgers, we think even then that things might be
looked upon as rather promiscuous by persons in-
dited to be severe in their notions of propriety.
But perhaps the “lodgers” arc interesting only
from an etomological point of view. The tourist
travelling in Scotland is astonished with the abund-
ance of the land in objects of this kind. He never
falls to carry some home with him, because there
are plenty and to spare. "God bless the Duk of

COPPER-COLORED.
I have been afflicted with a troublesome skin
disease, covering almost completely the upper
part of my body, causing my skin to assume a
copper-colored hue. It could be rubbed off like
dandruff, and at times causing intolerable itching
and the most intense suffering. I have used blood
purifiers, pills, and other advertised remedies, but
experienced no relief until I procured the Cuti-
CURA Remedies, which, although used carelessly
and irregularly, cured me, allaying that terrible
Itching, and restoring my skin to its natural color.
I am willing to make affidavit to the truth of this
statement.

A curiosity In journalism la the proprietor

poem to himself to the following tune:—
“ Fair Germanton, like love-siok maid.

And loving heart did droop and fade.
Although so fair and comely.
“ She now comes smiling to the fore—
A pleasant sight to look on;
She's found a Hart I and sighs no more.
For Fate has kindly sent one.”
It seems his name is Hart, and so the quaint con-
ceit of Germanton being a love-sick maid until
she found a Hart is justified. The verses are
signed with his initials, so that wc take it he wrote
them himeelt. This was a beautiiul beginning.
But it did not last long. In his second issue he
became sordid, and asked subscribers to pay up 1

their solicitude for the rising generation. The

they only remember the unpleasantnesses of life.
They distinctly recollect being sick after the

“ draws.” Now, our sympathy is with the boys in
most of their little diversions. We would grieve
deeply if one of our male olive-branches were

“ Observer” writes to the Morctva Some-
thing commencing “ Dear sir, The subject of
these remarks is one which must strike every re-
spectable funeral-goer.” He says he can’t have a
quiet, comfortable little funeral In his family, and
be allowed to lean back in the coal-tarred “ fly "
and dream of the glories of life insurance, without
the procession being “cut off” continually at
street corners by the youth of the district, who
invariably ealute each appearance of the heax-so
with a wild halloo of delight. At times, the con-
duct of this, the youthful section of the populace,
becomes even more unbearable—persons in the
crowd saluting the mourning-coach with derisive
cheers and such expressions as, “Oh, cornel put
away that tent-fly “ Here, fetch him out of that
circus-waggon in mournin’ “ Hi, mister, he ain’t
dead. Can’t you 'ear him a-coughin’ of the lid
off together with offers of a mop wherewith to
swab up his (“Observer’s”) tears, and other simi-
lar proceedings, all of which were calculated to
cover the cortege with ignominy. Not content
with this, "Observer” remarks with grief that
constituting themselves mock mourners, the local
youth will attend the cemetery as well, and If the
weather look a little threatening, will cry—“/n
with him ! ”—“Whoop I down-a-dalsy”—“Drop
’lm in afore he gets his whiskers wet’’—with more
to the same evil purpose; to the great discomfi-
ture of the Curate, who is now as hard to find for
a funeral as Upjohn is for a strangling match.
“Observer,” in conclusion, seems to hint that if
this kind of thing goes on much longer, he will, in
future. Instead of treating the Moruyans to a
dignified spectacle, have all his funerals in his own
back yard, with no more ceremony connected
with the obsequies than the ordinary pine six-
footer, and Just the meat-axe, that had invoked
the funeral, laid upon the coffin-lid, teatly orna-
mented wiih a piece of old bat-band.

The Bowral Free Press on aquatics:—
“The scholar's highest awards and the athletic’s
renown have been the portion of Australians.”
“The athletic” Is, we darkly conjecture, Bow-
ralese for “the athlete.” The language is
strangely like English. Of Hanlan, this authority
on sport and scholarship remarks: “ Ho has been
the bright particular star in the equatio orbit only
to be eclipsed by an Australian light.” “ Equatio ’’
is a near enough approach to “ aquatic ” for us to
guess at the meaning, but when it is associated
with “orbit” wo are plunged in confusion. What
is an “equatio orbit?’’ What, for the matter of
that, would an aquatic orbit be ? But we daresay
the idiom of Bowralese admits of these expres-
sions. Tho article is wound up with this elegant
and for Hanlan-oomfortlng reflection: “Every
dog must have his day, and the defeated champion
as (sic; had his.” This comes from the employ-
ment of Kanakas as editors.

Patriotism as a tine art has only reached

selves? Why, several of them set up-on the

it is truer than the truth that is in wine. We

thing of the past; but it is remarked that there is
an active demand arising lor youths above the age
of 14 to run messages.
The steel shot used by our artillerists cost
sixteen shillings each Even if every shot killed a
man, it would be much cheaper when toes mvane
us to welcome them on shore and feast thecn on the

Henniker Heaton is grieved—in the Even-
ooze—that there is no Australian Record olh- e tor
the keeping of papers concerning famous colonists.
One of these days, when Henniker crawls a niche
higher in the Temple of Fame, he will regret hav-
ing* said this. For somebody may acr. upon it.
“ Seditious journalism in India is being
support'd by Russian money” read out a country
editor from his -‘reprint” to ks wife, the other
day. “Pitv you couldn’t bo a seditious Indian
journalist, dear,” she remarked, and smacked the
youngest but six gently over the head with a
11 side-stick.”
The Martinis of Lome remarked, the other
day, that “ in old times it was said that boys were
taught to speak the truth and to ride. In our old
days, only those boys who dldn t speak the truth
were taught to ride—on a wooden quadruped.
They were 41 horsed.”
It is estimated that 8,000,000 persons tra-
velled by the trams la Sydney during the year
1883. Out of these, eight only were killed—one to
every million. And this after all the gory articles
Alfred used to print about the 44 Tram Fiend and
44 Juggernaut Again”! Why, the articles killed
more than the trams dldl
The local paper of a Southern town says:
— 44 Preparations are being made for another Band
of Hope entertainment at the Wesleyan Churoh.
This is rather a stilted way of saying that galvan-
ized-iron shields are being constructed for the
protection of the singers. Yet that is wnat is
meant. But some people will pose.
An enthusiastic speaker at an Orange meet-
ing held at Quirindi remarked that he was “glad
to say that Pope* y was dying out in Portugal. The
oldest nun there is 108.'’ If this be the rate at
wnich it is dying out, we reckon that Popery is
about the best speculation lor an Insurance Office
that is to found on this side of Everlasting Glory.
Mr. Colonna Close is going for Gunnedah.
Wo believe bis motto is a saying of Lothair’s:—
‘ Thou must see Colonna.’’ Ho is, we might say,

“I’ll give you the tip when to kneel
down,” said Chris’s best man to the groom on the
wav to the wedding. “ Ha' e I got to kneel
down ?” cried Chris. “ What a bore. If I’d known
that before, hanged if I’d have put on my pants.”
Then he commenced wrestling with the oenzined
nines, until the barouche smelt like a prosperous
gas-works.
A Tumut gentleman who was said, in the
elegant vernacular of the place, to have been
slightly “off his onion ” lately, is now reported as
fully recovered. The reason of this report is that
he h is since got married. They consider this a
proof of sanity in Tumut. No wonder Tommy
O’Mara lauvhs in his shoe at them, and goes on his
way regardless.
It was in a clergyman's family, and the
eldest brother, cet- 12, was studying the steam-
engine in me interval of catechism. The question
under discussion was, “ Why was the baby so
naughty ?” “Papa,” said the heir, “as we ail in-
herit the sitv of Auam, and the baby Is such a little '
fellow, isn’t there a greater pressure to the square I
inch on him than on the rest of us?”

No wonder John Chinaman keeps out of England!
You remember the paragraph we wrote
about the man who suddenly disappeared from a
Hay hotel a few weeks ago, and how wo stated It
as our opinion that the “tail dark man” who
called for him was the veritable Devil ? Well, the
body of the missing man was discovered on a snag
in the river two or three days back. He went to
Hell by water! Woe to the wicked, for the days
are approaching when they will gnash their gums
and call on John Lucas to fall on them 1
“ft was a very pretty marriage, and al-
though the dear little girl had been on the stage
and had danced in burlesque, yet she had played
her part in life so well that lots of people believed
she had always been as meek and proper as Saint
Ursula. Jiggins the J., who was the bridegroom,
looked preud and hapuy at the property lather
when the curate read, “ Who givoih this girl
away?" But then there came a voice from the
side aisle, “I could give her away, but I ain’t
a-golng to.”
The editor of the Cooktown Independent
appears to have borrowed a ladder and climbed up
olf his little onion. This is his odour now; “The
Sydney Bulletin has another ‘lying fling’ at the
editor of this journal, even more distorted, al-
though about »s chivalrous in spirit, as the reports
In the Courier and its corner echo. ‘ There are
reptiles whose poison is innocuous.’ (Bufl’on.)”
Why he omits an “o” in the last syllable is not
clear. Surely' a man ought to be able to spell his
own name?
More gall has been added to the already
sufficiently bitter cup which is held to the lips of
losers in a libel action, bays an exchange:—“ To
show their sympathy with the proprietor of the
Express in the laie libel action, in which he
sutfered defeat, theCooma people intend assisting
him by giving a concert for bis benefit. - ’ ibis is
dancing upon a man when he’s down, with a ven-
geance! Who. alter this, would wish to bean
editor and tell the truth ?
“What are you?” said a metropolitan
Magistrate to a witness last week. “I’m assistant
to a photographer, ’ was the reply. “ What part
of the business do you attend to?” enquired his
Worship. “The outside business is my departs
raont,” said the witness: “and now that your
Worship has introduced the subject, I have some
samples here which will, doubtless, meet with
your approval. Take you and your baby any hour
of the day, bany weather; three for arf-a-crown,
height for five shillia’s. Tho ” “ Stand down,
sir.”
Whatever may be said against the Parkes
Ministry, it must be allowed that in some things
they had more sense than this one. This Mr. Brod-
ribn clearly proved in the House the other night,
when he said that having once invited Dr. Ken-
wick—then Minister for Mines-togo to Bourke,
that gentleman could only get permission from his
colleagues to accept the invitation provided he did
not make any speeches on the occasion. It the pre-
sent Ministry bad been so prudent, we raiaht still
have a lingering belief In its ability. But bucolic
banquets were too much for it.
The Mddgee Independent calls the Echo
writers “ Refugees of the Attic." It also remarks,
“ One cannot expect much manhood or manners
for'a penny,” With legard to the latter statement,
it is only just what we expected from the editor of
the M.I. Of course, ho can t exp ct much man-
hood or manners for a penny in Sydney, when he
can t give any at all in Mudgee for threeptnee.
When the Giraffe used to boss the Lawn-Mower,
in Mudgee, he has called us many worse things
than “ refugees of the attlo.” That was wht n he
was writing serials, and we put some of our attlo
salt on bis tale.
The Tasmanian Government has taken to
patronising poetry. It has just concluded to give
an annuity to a literary lady who has written some
little tales for children, and some poetical compo-
sitions which we have heard (if but never seen.
An annuity of £100, and paid regularly every
quarter! The Muses can afford to be respectable
ia Tasmania, at this rate. Hero they are usually
to be found either in the rum vaults or the look-
up. Yet we see a way la which t-ladeu might,
perhaps, get a pension from the Government of
this colony for his poetry. How? Well, by pledg-
ing himself, on pain of death, i ot to write any
more!
“I believe,” said Mr. Blaokmann, by way
of clinching his argument that German should be
taught in high schools, “that Sir Wigram Allen
has a German governess for hla children." And,
verily, it is a clincher that no person of “ correct ”
views can resist. Scores of paters and maters-
familias, who would never otherwise see the good
ot having their children taught the tongue of
Goethe and Schiller. Humboldt and Lessing, Scho-
penhauer and Hegel, Heyseand Heine, will clearly
see the value of having their darlings trained as
ne«rly an possible on the same lines as those on
which Is run tho education of the kids of a
knighted plutocrat.
Even widows have luck. A Hay teamster
died lately, leaving a wife and family and his team.
There was £230 owing on the latter, it was valued
at £400. Tho widow accordingly decided to dis-
pose of it by lottery, and sold £333 worth of
tickets. The remaining 68 she kept herself, and
with the very first ticket she drew the team! Now
she can keep it, and! pay her debts if she likes—
though we should think a person so signally
favoured by Fortune would hardly make such
foolish use of her luck as that. W hat we should
like to know next is, who will draw the widow.
On hearing the name of the winner in that lottery,
we will be happy to forward him an epitaph free
of charge.
“A YOUNG GENTLEMAN, AGE 23, WITHOUT FRIENDS, RECENTLY FROM ENGLAND,
WISHES TO BE ADOPTED BY AN OLD LADY OR GENTLEMAN. THIS IS GENUINE.
ADDRESS L. L.. HERALD OFFICE, SYDNEY.”
We think we know this youth. If we mistake not, he it was who played the part
of the Bearded Woman in Artemus Ward’s show, some years since; and got the great
showman into trouble by getting drunk, and disclosing his sex by standing on bis head
said showing his top boots. However, we are glad to hear that his “ad.” has borne
fruit. He has been “ adopted ”by a real nice old girl of some 90 summers; and no was
toe sits upon her knee in the gloaming, and hears her recall day after day passages
from the lives of nine previous husbands (whose accumulated legacies, she tells him,
8 hall be his [the orphan’s] if he survives her), he realises the fact that it is only in
new countries, where competition in every line of life is reduced to a minimum, that
the orphan business even finds a market.

“Lore,” at tennis, means nothing. It often
means very little elsewhere,
Neat, this, very :—“ Mustapha ben Ismail
has just arrived In Paris from Tunis, accompanied
by his wife and his two sons. The suite consists of
seventeen governesses and seven servants.”
“Very strange. The supplement to the
Cambeibge Chrontcee, after giving the names
of the ’‘Junior Ops.” had one significant line
under the heading “ Women.—Wranglers. None.”
An Old Bachelor (of Arts) exclaims, “Ts that pos-
sible?”
“We are getting a race of husbands,” re-
marked an English Judge, the other day, “ that
ought to be obliterated.” He had one before him
at the moment, who bad come home, taken his mar-
riage certificate and some family pictures from tho
wall, and made a bonfire of them in the middle of
the room.
“ Nail-portralte says the Graphic “are
the latest fancy among Gallic lovers A miniature
likeness of the beloved one is photographed on
the thumb-nail, so that the devoted swain may
always h >ve herimagebefore him.” Exactly. On
his thumb he has her shadow. Under her thumb
she has him.
A lady writes thus to an editor:—“I have
two gentlemen friends who are very devoted to
me, and I like them equally well. Lately they
have both declared their love tor me. What am I
to do, as 1 love them both ? ” The editor answers:
“Goon loving till you love one better than the
other, then have him.”
Here is a terrible consequence of the insti-
tution of the divorce law in France. A young
man gets a divorce and marries a second time; but
the mother|of his first wife haslheen divorced, too,
and has married the father of his second wife.
Thus the young man has changed his wife, but not
bis raother-ln-law. Where, then, is tho profit on
the transaction ?
A Liverpool barber the other day “cleared”
with a young lady of good family, but the pair,
who had taken passage as brother and sister, were
caught on a steamer bound for America, and, as
the girl was under age, she had to go back with
her parents. The barber left In the steamer, en-
couraged, however, by the parting assurance of
his lady love, who bad so suddenly been taken
from him, of “ I’ll follow thee, lad! ”
Some ladies who, with their husbands, re-
cently visited an Austrian monastery, were en-
chanted by the spacious cloisters, rich dining-hall,
splendid library, and lovely gardens: the generons
collation and rare wines raised their admiration
to tho utmost. As they left, an enthusiastic
young lady said to one of the monks: “ You are in
Heaven here.” He was equal to the occasion.
“We should be,” ne replied, “but we iaok the
angels.”
At a dance recently, a fat old gentleman
with a bad cold and a charming wife. Insisted,
somewhat Inconveniently, that she should at once
return to the bosom other family. “ Nevermind,”
said sh c to her partner, “I'll find a way to stay."
So she slipped out while the sets were forming,
went into the gentlemen’s cloak-room, got her
husband’s hat and threw It out of the window.
Then returning, and requesting her spouse fl st
to find his hat and evil the carriage, she accepted
partners for the next six dances.
Mrs. Langtry’s dresses are of such import-
ance that the name of her Parisian dressmaker,
Madame Doncet, is now always printed on the
bills. Personally, we have hold the opinion that
the cleverest dressmaker is the one whose creatloqs
produce the greatest effect on men. If this be so,
Madame Doncet is worthy of being put on the
bills. The very latest style of ladies’ dress is a
pcculia bodice, which looks exactly like corsets
worn outside. The Lily’s modiste has seized this
idea with success. In one act, as Lady Ormond,
she strolls out before breakfast in a pink jacket
with a white lace top, and a pair of these new pink
satin corsets; and, judging from the number of
opera glasses levelled at her. the men do not seem
to find it disagreeable gazing at Mrs. L. in corsets.
It is said a beautiful woman Is never so beautiful
as when she has neither more nor less than these
Interesting articles on. At any rate, the new style
of makirtg them a sort of outside gear is a little
fairer to the spectator than the old-fashioned mys-
tery. Another dress worn by Mrs. Langtry in “A
Wife’s Secret ” is thus spicily described by a lady;
—“ The Lily’s blue satin bodice, in the third act, is
certainly the most explicit fit it has been my for-
tune to obs rv© in female apparel. Being made
with special reference to the scene to be enacted,
it stamps Madame Doncet as an artiste. The Cap-
tain, though amorous, is rather given to languor
in his gallantries than to hot-headedness. But
whena'man finds himself in company with this
bodice in a dimly-lit drawing-room at midnight,
with no danger of a husband’s intrusion, one must
admit that the peril is not confined to tho wife,
unless the lov r is altogether above human weak-
ness ” Well, a modiste who can make dresses to
fit with such a nice adjustment to circumstances
as that, is certainly an artiste.
“Surely that is not Langtry,” said a man
who saw her for the first time in “A Wife’s Pei 11,”
at ’Frisco; “ why, the photographs make her many
shades darker, and she’s got a wad on the top of
her head,” and so on. They are all surprised the
first time they see her. she is not a bit like her
pictures. The fact is, no camera can photograph
the exquisite fairness of the woman—a fairness
that will bear minutest scrutiny in the searching
light of day. A fairness of pink and white, be-
gotten of porh-ct health. That is where the Lily
has the advantage; she has a glorious constitution,
such as God gives hardly to one woman in five
thousand. In the dazzling white glow of her skin,
the unclouded blue of her eyes, » he delicate eye-
brows and ears, the glory of her shining hair; in
her elastic step and queenly carriage of figure;
God’s heritage of health and wholesomeness of
being are so shown In the woman as to make her
famous throughthe world. Numbersof peoplede-
preciate her—but they are those who have never
known or spoaen to her: none ever do so who
have once been brought within the range of her
wondrous personality. Even now, in her artificial
life, she still has the taste that was born with her
la her island home at Jersey for active exercises,
and whenever she has a chance indulges in long
walks that would be impossible to other fashion-
able women. When Mrs. Langtry fell a complete
somer-'ault over a stage sofa, last year, before a
theatre full of people, the way she bounded up
stamped her as a gymmstic genius of the most
cha-ming sort; and people crowded the theatre
for weeks after to see her do it again. But she
didn't. She probably thinks that the people who
oome into the fi-ont seats with their opera-glasses
are favoured enough by seeing, above her beauti
ful evening dress, a neck and shoulders that have
become famous beyond all other busts. The “ wad
on the top of her bead ” Is easily explained. After
Mrs. Langtry bad invented astyleot head-dressing
suitable to her own beauty, it spread over the land
quicker than a plague. Every woman in the four
quarters of the globe seized on her p itent, and dis-
figured the Langtry bang. So she had to find some,
thing new. She i ow wears a wad on the top ol her
head. It Is inartistic, and unbecoming even to hei ;
but it would make any ordinary woman almost
repulsive, and will not therefoie be much copied.
There are lots of people who consider It stamps
them as possessing- critical Judgment to see no
beauty In the Lily: it argues that they have a very
high ideal, and more taste than their fellows. They
know twenty women who surpass Mrs. Langtry In
beauty; but they never point one out.
For a few moments we were puzzled
whether to make this a sporting mem., or a woman
item. It s about a strong young woman; but she
has been knocking out men In a way so very un-
usual with the gentle sex, that we really couldn’t
determine whether to turn her over to the
4 Referee ” mun, or hand her tenderly to the fellow
who carves out our modest little ” Woman " para-
graphs. Spinning a coin on this momentuous ques
tlon, it came down woman; so now he s going to
dress it up just so delicately that our hluest-eved
little reader won’t get warm cheeks as she spells it
out. Well, the wonder is Miss Lulu Hurst; and
she possesses a peculiar force that no oue has yet
been able to account for. She is so strong, that
although three months ago hardly anyone knew
she existed in the wilds of Georgia, United
States, now she has paid off the mortgage on
her father’s farm, and put three or four hundred
pounds to her own account in the bank, aud the
men can’t get into the theatre quickly enough to
see her throw great muscular fellows about. There
is something supremely bucolic and ingenuous
about Miss Hurst. She has red cheeks, a stalwart
figure, a good-natured smile, and a deep chuckle.
Sho laughs constantly. She tosses strong men
around the stage, and giggles when they flounder
among the scenery. She spins d ,des around like
tops, and laughs as she watches them wheel over
the edge among the orchestra. New Fork Is di-
vided into two classes of men—those who believe
that Miss Hurst Is simply an abnormally strong and
muscular woman, aud those who have faith In her
magnetic or electric powers. Scientists sneer at
her, attend her performance, are tlung about the
stage, and retire. She doesn’t wrestle or box-or
we would have banded this par. over to the *• Re-
feree” man at once—but her favourite method is
to make her victim hold a rolling-pin or a walking
stick quite firm, and try to stand nisiground. When
he fancies he’s ready, the Georgia girl walks up to
him, looks In his eyes, and cheerfully gitrglcs as
she just puts her hand against the stick. Then the
man commences antics he never dreamed of per-
forming; he whirls round, and runs to and fro, and
contorts with the slightest motion of her linger,
and the only thing stops him is the walls of the
building. An ordinary man is hardly any fun to
her at all; so the New Yorkers fetched out their
strongest man, Mr. James Laflin. Some Tears ago,
Mr. James Laflin went to ihe Vienna Exposition,
and there, suitably dressed, or rather undressed,
he stood on a pedestal and exhibited his muscles
to the assembled world's fair. The result was that
the authorities gave Mr. Laflin a medal in which
his muscular development was highly commended
in choice and formal French, and the [Inscription
on this medal is translated by the owner-who,
however, only speaks early Irish himself—thus:
“ Professor J. M. Laflin, the Handsomest Formed
Man In the World.” He is certainly a person of
extreme strength, and so when Mr. Laflin walked
Jauntily on to the stage, the house nearly lost
itself In enthusiasm. He wore a tranquil, though
slightly contemptuous smile, as he seized a
hilllard-cue in both hands and faced Miss Hurst.
She looked small and overmatched. Laflin turned
around and winked at the boys. Miss Hurst
touched the cue with the palm of her hand, a*d
"The Handsomest Formed Man In the World”
started as though struck by a thunderbolt and be-
gan to struggle backward over the stage. He
ceased to wink, and the smile bad melted away.
Then 44 The Handsomest Formed Man In the World"
gave an inhuman howl, and flopped over backward
on the stage with an Intensity which shook the
scenery and reverberated through the house. Then
his friends picked Mr. Laflin up, and he made for
the nearest door, while Miss Hurst cackled more
delightedly than ever. There have been strong
men innumerable ou the stage to cope with the
Georgiapirl, but all come oil again, and leave her
chuckling and perfectly calm. Occasionally, some
man ot great muscle and strong will resists for a
short time, but in the end they all succumb.
Though she tires out several men every night, she
shows no fatigue. Numbers of men haveatteuded
every performance, and studied her, but the secret
of her wonderful power is yet a mystery. In fact,
they leave her presence quite exhurstod.

SPORTING AND ATHLETIC MEMS.
The Matterson-Peter Kemp race, to come j
off on the Nepean on 18th October, appears a mys- |
tery to us. Kemp has never been in an outrigger,
and we fancy he might have dropped on a “softer
thing than the fourth or fifth best man in Aus-
tralia. Kemp has ordered a craft from Dodd, and,
by the way, the North Shore builder is now as
popular amongst the rowing men as his namesake
“ Tommy ” was with the music hall people some
years back.
W. G. George, the English amateur cham-
pion, has not met Myers, the American representa-
tive, In England this season. Myeis wants him to j
run three distances-half-a-mlle, 1000 yards, and
1300 yards; but George, who beat the American in
a triplicate match in the states, naturally declines
to run over Myers' favourite distances. Meek, the
walker, who came over to England with the Ame-
rican, lowered the four-mile record from 39mln.
39sec. to 39min. lOsec.
“Feats of strength, quoted merely to show
that the hero of the tricycle ride from Sydney to
Melbourne, la still in form. He disposed of nine
meals and an impudent wood-carter on his last
day, when in spite of wind, rain and hail, to say
nothing of charming roads, he rode sixty-two
miles. Bravo ! ‘ Cop.’ May you have many
cop-lera.” Thus a writer in that blood and thunder
Journal, the Cycling News, on Copland’s now
listorio ride. There’s a look of hot copiers about
this.
The latest novelty in sport is a. series of
oxen races, which have just been run in a suburb
of Munich. Unlike the bull-fights which prevail
further south on the Continent, the cruelty in this
sport is chiefly toward the hutnan participants.
The oxen were saddled, bridled, and ridden like
horses by jockeys, who were armed with whips
and spurs. The steers proved most intractable
steeds, however, and all but one of the jockeys
were thrown, some of them being quite severely
injured.
The plucky ones at the back of Clifford
must certainly have great confidence in their man,
and we do not think we are wrong in stating that
the offer to back him straightaway for throe
matches of £500 each Is unprecedented in the his-
tory of aquatics. That Clifford must have done
something to Inspire snohconfidence goes without
Double Bay Regatta fixed for November 1.
Where is Elias Lay cock during all this
match-making ?
Mr. Renshaw has for the fourth time worn
the English Jawu-tennls championship.
Mr. Rabbit-Inspector Shrachau won the
first prize at the Hay Gun Club matches, killing
his five birds without a miss.
The N.Y. National Police Gazette saysq
“Fario, a dark outsider, won the ti> dney Cup.”
We must go from home to hear the news.
The latest In re John L. Sullivan is that
the champion pugilist and boozer is a candidate
for the position of Mayor of Boston And, why
not ? Have we not got —[Enough.—En* B.]
To-morrow, Friday, Messrs. Brett and
Sharlaud row over the champion comae for a
trophy. Given Brett is fit and well—and at latest
he was all that—we expect to see him land the dol
we mean the valuable trophy.
Mr. Keene, the Yankee horse-owner, has
gained his point with regard to the impo. cation
into America of tho Goodwood Cup won by Fox-
hall in 1883. The Customs authorities have now
allowed the Cup to enter duty tree.
The Nooze man states that Matterson wai
steered in tho Edwards race by Fern, who trained
dim. We could have sworn wo saw Tommy Kelly,
armed with a cardinal handkerchief, doing the
needful from the bow of the Admiral.
The Melbourne Sportsman gives as portion
of Beach's measurements, “ round the xorearra
10 in., round tho biceps 18 in.” The writer doesn t
tell the circumference of the pewter out of which
he quaffed previous to inditing the paragraph.
“Owing to the costumes of the boating
men it is almost impossible for ladies to use the
river.” The cry will soon be that owing to the
costumes of tho ladles it is almost impossible for a
Christian young man to go to an evening party.
It is stated that the Tasmanians intend to
make a bid for tbe rowing of the next Intercolonial
eight oar race on the Derwent. Tais is almost as
“ cheeky ” as the Times’ suggestion that our oars-
men should go home to pulton poor old played-out
Thames.
Thus the Nooze:— “T. C. O’Brien, the pro-
mising young cricketer, who gave the Australian
Eleven some trouble at the beginning of the pre-
sent Eng;ish season, is the nephew ot Sir Patrick
O’Brien.” This is news, indeed ! But wno, m the
name of thunder, is Sir Patrick O’Brien ?
At Chicago (U.S.) Driving Park, on July
10, Westmont, a pacer, made a mile with running
mate in 3min. beating all records by
several seconds. The first quarter was done in
the half-mile in lmin„ and the three-
quarters in Imin. 30sec. A lignt road waggon was
used.
At the London Athletic Club meeting, the
120-yards hurdle challenge oup was appropriated
by Mr. Lockton, the celebrated Tasmanian ama-
teur, who has probably won more prizes than any
man living. The English half-mile amateur swim-
ming championship has been won by George Bell.

“The Australian colonies,” remarks a
London paper “ have contributed £15,000 towards
the annexation of New Guinea. Tbe Australian
cricketers did not subscribe, but they are ready to
play a match against eleven non-interventionists
selected by Lird Derby lor the honour of the
Antipodes and all the gate money.” Hum! What
do you say, Billy Murdoch ?
The sympathy of the Warrington (Eng.)
magistrates was on June 16 extended to two
youths named Henry Holt and William Wi kinson,
who were charged with playing the Illegal game
of pitch-and-toss. The case was dismissed in con-
sequence of tbe novel defence set up, which was
that they were tos-ing to see which should pay for
u poor cripple-boy to go to tbe theatre.
There is trouble in store for the men of
mua le down Cabbage Garoenwiy. The proprie-
tor of the Melbourne Victoria Hall has been threat-
ened by tbe authorities with prosecution if be
allows Jackson and Farnham to giove lignt ia his
hall. Why not come up to Sydney? we do things
in better style here. The Inspector-General may
be induced to attend the show d la the Mlller-Foley
affair.
No le?s than 400 counterfeit tickets were
taken at the recent ouiuvaa Mitchell fizzle. When
accounts were squared up, each man rev:eived
about £430. Good pay, this, for one man suffering
from fever and ague, and tho other from a severe
alcoholic attack. We don’t know about the fever
and ague, but we’ll venture our reputation that
we could obtain any number of men to do the
“drunk” part for something less than half the
money.
The match in outriggers—the first, by the
way, ever pulled on the Iilawarra Lake—between
Massey and Duley, resulted in anything but a
satisfactory manner. There was a regular sea
running, and Massey was winning with ease when
the cork, washed out of his boat and she swamped,
leaving Duley to finish by himself. Both men
pulled in boats turned out by Dodd. If they meet
again, tbe odds should be a few hundreds to one
on Masai y.
saying. A good judge of rowing who saw him
doing a spin recently on the Illawarra Lake, told
us that the “long’un” was going like a piece of
machinery, and pulling in tar and away better
form than Beach has ever shown.
Our champion wobbler, Edwards, at latest
was In England, Says Bell’s Like:—“W. Ed-
wards, the celebrated long-distance walker and
champion of Australia, has arrived In England,
and called on us yesterday. He looks in rare fettle,
but is not particularly anxleus to get to work just
yet, his trip being chiefly a holiday one If, how-
ever, Littlewood or anyone else wishes for a match,
he might possibly be accommodated; and Edwards
is desirous of entering the lists against Weston,
O’Leary, Vaughan, or any ether walker next fall,
the walk to take place in New York.”
On the opening day of the A.J.C. Spring
meeting, Dr. Corlis’ Despatch made an easy win of
the Hurdle race from Uhlan, Vidette third; the
Hon. Jas. White’s Tempo defeated Zeno by a neck
for the Trial Stakes, Boscawen third. Tho betting
was 4 to 1 on the Hon. Jas. White’s Bargo for the
Derby, which he won with the greatest ease from
his stable companion Tremando, in 3 minutes 43!4
seconds, the fastest time yet done for an A.J.C.
Derby, Cairngorm running into a place. Mr. J.
Monaghan’s Espiegle made an unexpected win of
the EpsoncHflandicap by five lengths from Fernlea,
Lord Exetenlhird. Mr. J. O. Inglls’ Malua appro-
priated the Swing Stakes by a short head from Off
Colour, Reginald third; and Palareada finished
the day’s sports by winning the Welter Handicap
from The Tramp, Tristan third.
Many are the opinions expressed by the
Yankee press as to the eccentric—to say the least
of it—conduct of their sculler, Courtney. But we
think we have dropped on the correct hypothesis
this time. He is ■. victim of the newspapers. The
newspapers have made a great sculler of him, and
not being able to row up to the great standard
they have set for him, he has clung to the reputa-
tion and lied and sneaked out of various matches,
Instead of rowing them [are you sure Mr Court-
ney is not in the colony ?—Eu. B.] As a matter of
fact, Courtney has never beaten anyone worth
speaking of, besides Riley, who at best Is a third-
rater. Courtney’s last race, or rather fixture, with
Ross, was on fines something after the recent
Nepean affair. If he won he was to receive £500,
and if he lost £100. But he had not heart enough
to face it out.
In the item of “defence,” says “William
of Cloude'lee”: “Midwinter takes the palm.
When the Australians’ campaign closes, Midwinter
will be credited with preventing their losing a lot
of games. In the second Australians v. Gentle-
men of England he kept his wicket up by-ryhat
shall I call it?—sheer obstinacy; and at Hudders-
field simply would not be put out. The Yorkshire
crowd did not agree with Midwinter s tactics, and
thereby showed themselves very poor judges of
the game, and, in expressing their disapprobation,
bad sportsmen. Against 453 the Colonials 8 ®°r®d
175 and 124 for seven wickets. They could not pos-
sibly win, but had just a chance of playing out
time, and Midwinter was playing the right game
in doing his possible to beat the common enemy,
if so hard a word may be used of the Old Father
with the kindly hand.”
Courtney, the American sculler, chal-
lenged Wallace Boss to a match since the running-
away affair. Boss replied with the following:—
“ In view of the public career of Charles B. Court-
ney for several years past, and particularly because
he'has done so much to disgrace professional scull-
ing, we, the undersigned. In order to protect our-
selves and encourage square, manly rowing, here-
by pledge ourselves never to, In any respect, asso-
ciate or connect ourselves with said Courtney,
either by rowing with or against him at regattas
or elsewhere. Respectfully, Wallace Ross, Fred.
A. Plalsted, George H. Hosmer, Albert Hamm,
George Galsel, George W. Lee, H. Peterson, James
A. Ten Eyck, John Teemer. James H. Biley.”
Courtney has since been engaged to train a col-
lege crew. He is a greater success at the theory
than practice of rowing.
John L. Sullivan, in July last, had a very
narrow escape of being knocked out with that
very effective equaliser, a pistol bullet. A sport-
ing man named Coakiey entered a billiard room
where Sullivan was playing, and asked the cham-
pion to join him In a bottle of wine. Sullivan re-
fused, saying he could pay for his own wine; upon
which Coakiey retorted that Sullivan was putting
on a great deal of “side” considering that a few
years ago he hadn’t a shirt to bis back. John L.
rushed at Coakiey, who drew a double-barrelled
pistol, and, pointing- it point blank at Sullivan, was
in the act ot pulling the trigger when an onlooker
jumped in and seized the pistol, his hand covering
the nipples. How close Sullivan’s escape was may
be judged from the fact that the hammer de-
scended on the hand of the man that grasped the
Weapon, leaving an imprint that he carried about
for clays.
The American public hare worked them-
selves up to about 130 deg. In the shade about the
proposed match or matches between Maud 8., Jay
Eye See, and Clingstone. Maud 8. has done 3m.
Ssec. Jay Bye See’s best record so far Is 3m.
sec., and it Is felt by the people that he would
surely stretch the other half second, especially
when trying his hardest alongside such a grand
goer as the mare. But, then. Maud 8. might stretch
too. Vanderbilt, her owner, however, declares
that no borse of bis shall run for a money stoke,
for a public purse, or for any similar prize. Why
Vanderbilt, who is in his way the greatest gambler
in the world, should thus set his face against
gambling by means of horses, against the mere
actual running for stakes and prizes, it would be
futile endeavouring to discover. Perhaps he has
a bit the best in the one set of transactions which
he would vainly look for in the other.
Thus the London Echo “ It is a pity for
the Australians that their cricket match against
All-England could not be finished, for there Is no
doubt that the visitors would have won with a bit
in hand. Shrewsbury, Steel, and Lucas proved by
their consistent scoring in each innings that the
wicket had little or nothing to do with the low
totals made by the English eleven; and it Is simply
unaccountable how Ulyett, of whom so much was
expected, came off so badly with the bat. The
English captain (Mr. Hornby) certainly, too, ought
to have stuck to his original position, and gone in
eighth wicket down, instead of going in first; and
the fact ot his being stumped in both innings
seems to say that be is hardly reliable enough to
represent England. Ulyett and Peate bowled fairly
well and yet every one of the Australians scored
in their only innings, so that the English trundling
did not go any way near to creating a funk, and
this little circumstance must settle the question—
that had the match been played out; the Antipo-
deans could not have been off winning.
Says the Hobart Mercury : —“ Mr. W.
Webster has returned from his visit to Sydney,
and informs us that he has made arrangements for
introducing to the Hobart public the famed ath-
letes of the day. In addition to having arranged
with Hanlan, be has also concluded terms with
Professor Miller, Victor, and T. M. Malone, the
latter being the champion sprint runner of the
colonies. This array or talent will appear together
in Hobart at an early date, the precise time de-
pending on arrangements now pendlnr between
Hanlan and Beach for another sculling contest.
Mr. Webster's enterprise will doubtless meet with
the reward it deserves at t r e hands of admirers of
manly sports in Tasmania. In reference to Hanlan,
Mr. Webster says that his defeat in the recent en-
counter with Beach is attributed by Hanlan him-
self to sinister influences, and not to any failure of
his cwn powers, and in this opinion many in Syd-
ney concur. Among a favoured few it was known
previous to the race that Hanlan would not be
permitted to win.” A nd now the “ favoured few ”
want to know when Mr. Webster intends to return
to Sydney for the purpose of making final arrange-
ments—for bis funeral.
In America, a turtle-fight is considered
the next besst thing to a “ canine controversy."
At Staten Island, U.S., a couple of turtles had a
rough go In for a small stake. When the pair were
put close to each other on the floor, they remained
as still as two empty shells for an instant.
Then two snake-light heads darted out, and the
glittering eyes seemed to take In the surroundings
at a glance. Then the heads were drawn in and
there was a period of quiet. Next, one of the
turtles put out a fore flipper, and the other
snapped at it viciously. The other rospo"ded by
imbedding his teeth in the neck of his antagonist.
They held on for several minutes, and then they
were shook apart. For an hour and a half they
kept this sort of thing up. The favourite hold
was on a hind flipper, and when such a hold was ob-
tained the biting turtle dragged his victim around
the floor until ho was forced to give up his hold.
Their quickness and ferocity was wonderful. Their
heads flashed in and out like lightning, and their
teeth closed like vyoes upon every exposed bit of
flesh. At the end of an hour and a half they were
as full of fight as at the start, and to break their
last hold a stout stick had to be brought into re-
quisition. It was then decided to make the affair
a draw.
Two prize fights have just taken place in
England, and are recorded by all the papers in a
matter of fact way, without one word being said
as to the brutality and so on of the thing. The
first was between Jack Knlfton and Jack Massey.
Knlfton, who is 27 years of age, stands Git.2in.
high, and weighs 14 st. 7 lb., has won a couple of
boxing competitions, and was beaten In Madden’s
Tournament by Middings, in the latter end of 1883.
Massey, who is four years his senior, stands 5 ft.
8Un. in height, and weighed list. 81b. His prin-
cipal performance was beating Tom Tully, about
four years ago, fighting forty-five rounds in 1 hour
35 minutes. Knittonwon the toss, and chose the
highest ground. As soon as the fight commenced,
the disparity in the size of the men was very manl-
fest. * Knllton's advantages being conspicuous.
After thirty-eight rounds had been got through in
40 minutes, Massey, finding he h»d no chance, gave
in. Neither man was very heavily punished, each
having one eye shut up and a few bruises on the
neck and chest. At a fight at Birmingham, be-
tween two combatants known as •* Big Ben” and
•• Stinger,” the latter being a tall, thin, wiry man,
of about 36 years of age. and his opponent a tall,
muscular mac, of about the same age, a striker in
one of the forgej in the Black Country, 200 persons
were present. “ Stl. ger” won after an hour’s
desperate fighting. Both men were damaged fear-
fully about the face and body, “Stinger’s” nose
being broken.
In America, at Lake Sebago, on July 7,
Teemor and Conly rowed a five-mile race, with a
turn, for £200 a side. The betting was 100 to 80 on
Teenier. Hardly had the word “Go ” left the re-
feree's mouth before Teemer shot to the lead.
Both men were pulling at about a thirty-four
stroke, which they kept up to the end of the first
mile, at which point Teemer led by a boat’s length.
At the two and a half mile turning stake, Teemer,
without apparent effort, had increased his lead to
seven boat-lengths, and was then pulling 27 to the
minute. After squaring away for home, Conly
spurted, and slightly decreased the Pennsyl-
vanian’s lead: but the advantage thus gained was
lost shortly afterward by Teemer spurting and
again putting seven boat-lengths of clear water
between him and his antagonist. At the end of
tha third mile, Teemer seemed to have the race all
his own way, and several times rested his oars on
the water. At a mile and a half from the finish
Conly began to pick up with a stroke of 29 to the
minute, and at the commencement of the last mile
they were nearly even, and both men were spurt-
ing for the lead. Teemer, however, easily wont
ahead, and, gaining a boat s-lengtb, held it to the
finish. Teemer’s time, as taken at the stake-boat,
was 34m. lOseo.; Conly’s 34m. 12iseo.; making the
winner s time a minute quicker than the best pre-
vious record for a five-mile race between men.
The course had been laid out partly by guess-
work, so that no reliance can he placed upon the
time given.
The following is the petition the South
Australian Jockey Club are working up for pre-
sentation to Parliament, with the object of re-
instating the Totabsator“ Firstly, By discourag-
ing the breeding of blood stock, as the studmasters
and breeders of South Australia, who have laid out
vast sums of money in importing the very best of
sires from England and elsewhere, cannot find
purchasers lor their young stock at prices suffi-
ciently remunerative to warrant a continuance of
the breeding of such stock consequent on the
racing bodies in this colony being unable, without
the aid of the totalisator machine, to offer stakes of
sufficient value to induce sporting men to support
the breeders of blood stock [by purchasing their
yearlings at their annual sales as heretofore—a
most important industry being thus crippled.
Secondly, By driving owners ot racing studs to
Victoria and elsewhere, through their Inability to
race and maintain studs in this colony without
entailing considerable pecuniary loss, whereby a
large number of persons are deprived of employ-
ment and a considerable sum of money Is sent out
of the colony which would otherwise be distributed
to the benefit of corn and chaff merchants, saddlers,
farriers, farmers, and many others. Tour peti-
tioners therefore most respectfully request that
your honorab le House will be pleased to protect
their Interests by enacting a Bill provid ng for the
use of the totalisator machine under such restric-
tions as your honorable House in its wisdom may
consider desirable.”
It was evident from the small fields at the
Cyclists’ Union sports that the youngsters are
frightened of the track. The curves are too sharp;
few would deny that, when they see such an ac-
complished rider as Bennett unable to come round
at full speed without juunlng off the track on to
the grass. And on the upper side, if a rider does
come to grief, thei’e is a patch of bare stones to
fall on. The straight run has been made very
good, and when Elliott and Hart fell it must have
been more their own tault than the track. On
racing bikes, with a very strong wind beh nd, they
probably went faster than they ever went before,
and, being novices at racing, lost their heads. The
ten-mile race was Bennett’s all the time. Thurlow
led the third lap (three to the mile), Ferguson,
Clarie Wood, and Bennett following, Attwood right
in the rear. At lap eleven, he fell out of the pro-
cession, and only four completed the race. Fergie
went at it demon-like as long as he was able,
making the pace alternately with Thurlow, who
led round the fourteenth time; Ferguson had then
shot his bolt and fell back, while Wood laboured
to keep his place. He was evidently half trained.
Then Bennett challenged Thurlow, and after a
brief struggle took the lead, and kept it to the end
easily, the others spread-eagling behind him, as
the effects of tho pace at tho start and the strong
wind round the back ot the course told severely-
Ferguson made an insidious attempt to creep up
with a rush 1 or second place in the tbirtieth round,
but Thurlow spotted his copper-top gleaming in
the sun, and baulked his well-meant coup. Time
of race, 37Vii min. Previously, Bennett bad won
the one mile trike race, though A. Wood (sen.) bad
350'yards; and afterwards he fairly fodo down the
field In the three-mile bicycle handicap, j oucg H.

rV Lambton, wbo made a game struggle and cathq
lannnd being the only one who gave him any
frouble. Hal Lambton is the most brilliant young
Wcvclist on the track among the coming men.

Just now, when we hear so many ameient
opinions as to the amount of ease with which Ed-
ward Hanlan polished of his Christian natnesake,
Ved Trickett, in their memorable match rowed on
the Thames on 15th November. 1880, our readers
may not object if we fight the battle oyer again.
On the morning of the race, a thick fog hung over
♦ he valley Of the Thameas and although It lifted
firinglderdblj'’, a light huilg over the river and
fain was falling wiled the nlen started. At twenty
vyinnt PS bast noon, the,race started, Trickett
Striking 40 to Hanlan’s 34 At Simmons’ Yard,
about fwO hdndred yards from ihe start, the boats
#ere dead level, Thrickett thed comm meed to
Ipnstthdd out, and, dulling In much better form
than at the stdrt, drewawaV from the Canadian
and obtaine a short lead: blit at the quarter-mile
Hanlan had pulled un level; and a little further on
ifcfie leading by half a length, Trickett put in
some good work, and at the half there was nothing
to choose between the two men; but shortly after-
wards Trickett eased off, and Hanlan went away
foot bv foot, amidst the frenzied offerings of the
Canadian contingent to lay the odds. But the Aus-
tralian was not done with Just yet, and at the mile
point, shot in 4mln 53seo., had reduced the Cana-
dian’s lead to half-a-length, which the leader
lengthened out to a clear length at the Crab-tree,
something less than a mile and a quarter. And
then spurt and counter spurt took place between
the pair as far as Hammersmith Bridge, one mile
and three-quarters less 200 yards, when it looked
anybody’s race; but Hanlan came out of the
ordeal with a lot In hand and a lead of two lengths,
in 9min. 34sec. Trickett after this fell to pieces,
and Hanlan paddled over the remainder of the
course, finishing in 20min. 13sec,
We clip this from an American paper
11 Oh, we ain’t entirely without amusements and
sports in Arizona,” said a bearded passenger from
the south-west. “Of course, theaytres and cir-
cuses ate pretty scarce, and there hain’t nougn
levDl ground in the territory td play a game of
mss-ball on. But we has our fun all the same. In
the town where I live—mind you, we are gottin
civilised out there, and have towns now Instead of
fiWe camps—In my town our best sport Is with a
coloured man named Sam. He’s a big, strong
jack—that Is, he was. Poor fellow, he tempted
fate too often, and got took in finally. Sam made
his livin’ furnishing fun for the boys. He would
draw a chalk-Ilne on the floor, get down in front
of it on all fours, and for ten cents let any man
take a big bag of sand and crack him one from be-
hind. If the striker knocked Sam over the line, he
got his money back Well, this sport went along
several months, until one day a wloked-lnoklng
stranger comes to town. He saw Sam taking
In the dimes In the hotel bar-room, where
the stranger was a pretty good customer
himself already. ‘ Will ye let fflj have a
lick at ye for a dime?’ he Inquired of Sam.
‘Sartinly t sah; three for a quarter. Take a
quarter’s witth?’ The stranger said he guessed
one would be enough. Sam got down on all fours.
The strangei 1 then picked up the sandbag. Sara
lopoed his head down and grinned between his
legs at the striker. The Sandbar Is raised high In
the air, the wicked - looking stranger looks
wickeder out of his eyes, and we get on to his
powerful frame and arms all of a sudden. Like a
stroke o’ lightning down conies the bag—poor
Sam.” “ Did it hurt the nigger much ? “Hurt
Him? Nobody knows. The fact is, when he got
down on the floor his head was pointed toward the
wide-open door of the bar-room, out of which we
could look down the mountain side. Sam cata-
pulted out o’ that door, and hain’t been seen since.
One o’ the boys said he believed the coon had
never stopped till he got back to ‘ ole Alabam he
used ter talk so much about.” “ Did you find out
who the stranger was?” “Well, I should say we
did. His name was John L. Sullivan, a prize-
fighter from down East somewhere.” This Is one
of the biggest lies we have yet dropped across In
connection with Sullivan.
It was a case of diamond cut diamond at
the meeting held at J. D. Young’s hostelry, on
Thursday evening last, to arrange a match between
the two groat gun scullers, and in the end the
Yankee gem got all the best of It. “Well.” said
Hanlan to the Beach party, which, by the way,
was minus Beach, “ you are resolved to keep me
waiting six months for a match ?” To which Mr.
Deebles replied with a benignant smile, and a
“You can bet your life on that, Hanlan.” The
Hanlan trio then proposed a match in May, to
come off as near as possible on slack water, Mr.
Deebles agreeing to the first part of the proposi-
tion, but stating that the tide would have to take
Its chance. “ However,” added the International
bonifaco, “I’ll leave that for Beach to say,” and
forthwith he started In search of the Champion,
and in a very short period returned with him in
tow. Beach very properly said he would not agree
to pick a tide to suit Hanlan, and, after some re-
markably smart things had been said by both the
ex and present Champions, a match was fixed
up for the first Saturday in May next. At
regular intervals during the discussion, a re-
pi’esentative from Clifford offered to hack him
against any man in the world for £500
aside. After the Hanlan-Beach match had been
arranged for May, Beach stated he could not be
expected to lie idle for nine months, and if he saw
a soft £500 knocking about—no doubt having an
eye on Clifford’s oder-he would certainly go for
It, to which Mr. Alcock said they could not blame
him. Just then Clifford’s representative again
offered to make a match against all-comers, when
—horror to the opposite faction—Hanlan jumped
up and accepted, and almost in less time than it
takes to tell, ’a deposit was planked, and Hanlan
and Clifford were matched to row for £500 aside in
five months from last Saturday. This was certainly
a smart move on the Canadian’s part, as it pretty
well binds Beach down to hold the championship
till he meets him In May next. Had Beach and
Clifford been matched to row in the meantime,
Clifford may have won; and then Hanlan’s match
would not have been for the championship. So
far as his match with Clifford is concerned. It
is to come off in midsummer, certainly; but,
supposing he is beaten, it is not for the cham-
pionship, and in the event of his beating
Beach, he can then have another match on with
Clifford. In every way the visitor has the best of
it, and we are not sorry. Under all the circum-
stances, we think ihe Beach party should have
given him another show before the heavy summer
weather comes on. and to our thinking, in trying
to get so much the best of him they have over-
reached themselves. During the evening, Mr. J.
D. Young offered to match Clifford against Teemer,
the American sculler, for £500. Mr. Morris Green-
wall accepted on behalf of Teemer, and stated he
was willing to put up a deposit of £250 a side before
leaving Sydney; but if Teemer would not row, he
would expect the money to be returned. ’ Teemer
has jast defeated Conlv in America, and was to
row Wallace Ross early in August, but we have
not yet heard the result. It successful, the inten-
tion was to back him against Hanlan. As Hanlan
is booked here for the next nine months at least.
It does not appear improbable that Teemer will
come over and add his lustre to the biggest aquatic
boom Australia has ever experienced. The only
fear is that the young Americau may drop across
Granny’s account ot the Hanian-Beach race He
then may not feel inclined to run the risk of a
“gauntlet of Wind, Wave, and Tomki.”
“This,” said that distinguished lecturer,
Mr. B. Lewis Scott at the School of Arts, a few
nights ago, “this is Westminster Abbey, and that
little spot Jthere] Is the Poet’s Corner, the place
where some of the greatest geniuses the world
ever saw sleep the sleep of peace now that life »
fitful dream Is o’er. Why have not we a place
wherein to bury our great men as well ?” Screams
of laughter greeted this prize conundrum, “ and
yet,” as Granny Innocently observes, “the ques-
tion appeared to be seriously put.” The plain i act,
however, is that we have heaps of places wherein
to bury our great men, but the devil of it is our
great men won t die. If they did, Mr. Scott would
be picnicking with the worms to-day instead of
stumping gaily around with his derned old magic
lantern.
A Teacher’s Association has been formed.
Primarily, of course, its object will be to watch
such portion of the administration of the Educa-
tion Act as effects their own pocket, and nobody
who knows how th*>y have been humbugged by a
drowsy department for years can blame them.
They want, also, to be heard as a body on the duty
imposed on them of giving religious instruction.
Probably the bulk of them belong to some reli-
gious denomination, but in so large a body of
intelligent men and women, there must be great
numbers who are expected to parrot through what
are called religious reading lessons, or Sacred His-
tory, and who all the time feel degraded in their
own eyes to have to spell over and explain all
about the plagues, and Lot’s wife, &o., aud have t<>
be careful all the time not to let their views of
things come out by a smile or grunt of disgust.
Another object of the association is to promote a
wider intellectual culture, and certainly it is
needed; but it will only add to their discontent 1*.
with every step they take in the acquirement of
modern knowledge, the clergy and their echoing
elders persist in using their influence to force
them to teach honesty and truth for four hours in
the day. and then to practice Jesuitry for the fifth
—and all in the name of the Lord.
VARIOUS VERSES.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A Hymn to Humbug.
VERSES UNTO VICE.
Hail, mighty Humbug! offspring of deceit,
Hypocrisy, and lying; to thy feet
Thy suppliants throng, and own in secrecy
The conquests they achieve who live by Thee.
In ev’ry rank thy vofrles have a place—
Few are too proud to serve thee, none too base;
Yet none dare openly set forth thy praise,
But swear they walk in Virtue’s plainer ways;
And, ever as they thrive with lying tongue.
Ascribe to Truth the gifts thy power haa won.
The ardent convert i tfho Were lately made
In Edwin Booth's last Temperance CrUsido,
Wear in their coats, to prove their faith sincere.
The flaunting ribbon of King Gingerbeer;
And still we note that they most proudly boast
The ribbon, who in drink have sinned the most—
Those in their cups, who most excess displayed,
Now loudest talk in praise of Lemonade.
Ohl that thy followers in this bold way
Would own the King, whose precepts they obey;
And as from Virtue more and more they swerve,
More loudly boast the monarch whom they
serve;
And, when they part from Truth to join thy band,
Would vaunt the power of thy guiding hand.
But this can never be: for thy best arts
Seduce the reason, and mislead the hearts
Of truthful men, who never think that they
Who speak so fair, speak only to betray.
England’s high Sovereign, on the festal day,
Calls forth her troops, their numbers to display;
And Volunteers, in coats of scarlet hue,
Go gladly forth to join the grand review—
Thus, then, King Humbug! let thy warriors
pass.
File after file; and, with the looking-glass
Which Truth supplies, show who thy warriors
are,
And with what arms they carry on the war.
See first the Holy Humbug: he, the worst
Of all the frauds with which God’s world is curs’d,
Betrays his Maker's cause for sake of cash,
And sets His trademark to his own vile trash:
(But stay, my Muse! you ought, you know, to
laud
The arms of Humbug, trickery and fraud;
I really can’t allow this wild abuse—
You must not let your tongue run quite so loose:
Repress your liner feelings, and speak well
Of those whose presence would make Heaven a
heU).
Who, if the pastor’s honoured rank he claim,
Will artful use, with mind devoid of shame,
The high position, to indulge his vice,
And sell a spurious pass to Paradise.
Perchance—like those who study to evade
Bach new Land Act our Parliament has made,
And strive to break each salutary law,
By acting Just within its corners four—
He guardedly will break his Master’s code,
By arguing that his peculiar mode
Of sinning was not named by James or John—
So that no penalty ensues thereon.
He walks the path Iscariot has trod,
And thinks that he can humbug even God;
Or else, perhaps, he seeks but to mislead
The minds of men by putting on a creed.
Then from the weekly pulpit thunders forth
The dire effect of Heaven’s avenging wrath;
And, e’en while slating thus his fellow men.
From “Thou” to “his,” breaks precept number
Ten;
And, while attending to his neighbours’ lives,
Pays more than due attention to their wives.
One other cleric Humbug meets the view—
He fondly reads his Bible through and through:
Notes every verse, and cleverly distorts
The sense, to make it fit his petty thoughts—
“ Perverts the Prophets,” and the Gospels, too,
To prove his dainty whims and crotchets true.
A follower of the Word he is, we know.
But it must lead where he would wish to go;
Fain would he have the Bible overthrown,
If its blest maxims did not match his own,
Brimful of creed, he preaches sermons long,
To show how other men interpret wrong
The moaning of this passage or that verso,
And proves such worthy of a Saviour’s curse—
Or else, to satisfy his people’s need,
Condemns them all by Athanasius’ Creed:
He almost argues that Salvation’s won—
Not by the merit of the dying Son—
But by the robes of Bishop or of Priest,
By rubrics, or by facing to the East.
Then, there are those who don Religion’s dress
Just to condemn their neighbour’s wickedness,
And go to church that they may safely say
How wicked people are who stay away.
Lend helping hand to Mother Church’s labours
To prove that they are better than their neigh,
hours,
Devoutly trusting they to bliss will climb
By ladder built of others' sin and crime.
Next comes the man who, by Religion’s aid,
Hopes more successfully to cheat in trade:
With Pharalsaic mien, each Sawbath day,
He kneels within the House of God to pray
(He preys throughout the week, but here, we see,
The “ a ” in pray is altered to an e ”).
As loving husband, he will fondly make
Sale to his wife-just for “ aff ction’s sake ”—
Then, when he flies his schedule, it is found
That he can pay, p’r’aps, twopence in the pound.
While he is overwhelmed with seas of debts,
His greedy spouso retains the large assets—
Declines what he has given to restore.
But keeps her house, and footmen, as before.
Thus, as in games of whist, when partners lead
Each to the other’s hand, and both succeed,
Though one may lose if but the other gain
More points than their opponents can obtain.
Bo with these two; although you note, of course,
Though he may lose, he never feels the loss:
She keeps the gains—the official assignee
Clears off hi* score, and once more sets him free.
The fraud loaves on his mind no cicatrix,
He loses “ honours,” but he gains by “ tricks ”
(Although the game’s like whist, I would suggest
That cut-throat euchre may describe It best;
They two against the world play fast and loose,
And scoop the pool by leading with the “Deuce ”).
Though of all social thieves he's deemed the
worst,
He keeps his carcase out of Darllnghurst;
Yet still with Piety hts fraud he veils,
And throws the blame on God, whene’er he fails.
When Balak called on Balaam to asperse
The host of Israel with a mighty curse,
The prophet to the Moabite’s distress,
Though told to imprecate, could only bless.
But here the Muse another mind displays—
Gives but reproach and blame, when asked for
praise;
Against deceit she pours her anger forth.
Almost forgetting courtesy in wrath.
So let it be; and. if this truthful rhyme
Shall please the reader, at another time
The Muse shall sing, perchance In louder strain,
Of others, who are found in Humbug’s train.
ISHMAEL.
The Pressman's Bream.
“ 1 dreamt last night,” the pressman said—
“ Say on,” a poet cried,
** Now that the golden sight is fled
Across old Dreamland’s tide.
“ Oh. say how fair the vision came,
What sights of Paradise;
What angel chotrmgs thrilled thy frame,
What darts of angel eyes.
“ Tell me of brooklets murmuring,
And forests waving wide;
Of mountains tell and crystal spring—
Or, mayhap, of a bride
“ Whose lovely form, when sleep had fled,
Had vanished from thy gaze—
Saw'st thou again thy long lost dead,
Among the far-oll braes ?
“ Or, weft thou wandering through a land
All thronged with palaces—
Thyself a King, and on each hand
All joys thy heart to bless ?"
“ Nay, more than these,” the pressman cried,
“More than my tongue can tell;
Not visions of a vanished bride,
Nor home, nor village bell;
“ Not palaces, nor flowering vales,
Nor heavenly serenades;
Nor faces of my long lost dead,
Nor rambles in old glades.
“ What made my bosom throb with joy.
And what now makes me wipe
These bitter tears, was—” “ What, old boy ?”
“ I dreamt I had fried tripe!”
An Idyll.
They stood beneath a soft Spring sky,
.Esthetic lad and lass,
Around them blossomed sunflowers high,
About them bent the grass;
They talked—the rapture of their talk!
’Twas on a peacock’s feather,
Or else a dado or a stork—
Their “souls” were “one ” together.
“ Oh, love,” said he, and his pale nose
Grew crimsonly intense,
“ I would that thou wert but a rose,
And I a humble fence;
And thou wouldst cling unto me fast,
And all’about me twine—
Unmoved by any howling blast,
My rose would still be mine!”
“My heart,” sighed she, “is like yon sky—
So warmly, poppy red.
And. as a pleading rooster’s cry,
Echo the words you said;
But, like a tulip fair which screens
Its face, so I my choice — ”
“ you’ve got to come and string them beans!”
Yelled out her mother’s voice.
Back Again.
A still small voice (the same, I trow<
told the Laureate to fro
And hang himself or sling his woe,
What time he used to weep and boo
Abou! a Universe he knew
No more of than most others do)
Approached, and whispered unto me.
“ Throw down thy pen, and westward llee,
The gums again will welcome thee.”
Far out among the friendly trees,
On placid nights, had come a breeze
That sailed from cities ill at ease.
And, as I listened to'the cries
That fell out of its folds, my eyes
Down from the stars drew sympathies.
I said. “The trees will always stand,
The silent night be always grand.
But I shall die and leave the land.”
I also murmured. “ While my blood
Has heat and ruddiness, its flood
Shall flow to help a human good.”
And so I left the friendly trees,
And tracked the sorrow-laden breeze
Unto the cities ill at ease.
I plumed my pen to strike the throng
Of men who prosper and are strong
Through riding on the law of Wrong.
And time went on. My ink was done,
My pen had lost its point; alone
I sat with all my tether run.
’Twas then the still small voice came near,
And told m» to pack up and clear,
And seek the trees I once called dear.
But, to the still small voice I said,
“ There is a point I’ve marked ahead,
I go, despite the quick and dead.”
But then the still small voice replied,
“ To do it, thou must be supplied
Like others, whose renown iswj^e.
“ Thou seest Haddon, Bennej^Syme,
And thickest thou oanst ia0bh their prime—
Thy innocence amounts tferime.
“ These have a thing which they can show
To all men wheresoe’er they go,
And this it is that lifts them so.”
“ And what,” I cried, “ have they that I
Have not ?” Then came the curt reply,
“ A conscience.” ||Then I shut one eye,
And said “ O, still small voice, to these
I leave the cities ill at ease.
And back I go among the trees!”

SOCIAL
The cause of all those private carriages,
those dulcet sounds that floated out upon the star-
lit sultry air, the palm-decked porch, and all the
other tokens of high-toned gaiety that pervaded
the civic hall on Tuesday week, was the ball given
by the Aus’ralian Club. It seems hard that even
such a really nice society event as this could not
be held without obtrusive opposition to it—very
hard that well-dressed and affluent members of
society, who live in houses with special names to
them, cannot disport in an innocent dance without
having threats of a heated hereafter hurled at
them by people who are not well-dressed, and not
even refined. Yet. while the vehicles rolled by
with the wealth and cu Iture, style and ton, from the
flower fragrant suburbs of Sydney, there at the
very doors of pleasure, the ungrammatical Harmy
raved and demanded that the human race en masse,
not even exct-p ing carriage people, should give up
everything and come to the Lord. “ Ah 1 yer may
go by In yei carriages Into yer dazzlin’ ’alls," ob-
served the capting; “but some day yer’l dance
where there won’t be no music, only a weepln’,
and a wallin’, and a gnashin’ er teeth, my fereuds ’
But the affluent people heeded not the street Jere-
miah, and wont into the dance. Full preparations
had been made for them: except a few couches,
the seats had been moved from the vestibule to
make more room, and round the passages drawing-
room furniture was placed, interspersed with plant
ornaments and leafage. In the main entrance, a
sort of conservatory was arranged, delightfully
cool, and adorned with coloured drapings. standlm-
palms, pot-shrubs, ferns, &c. The ball-room door*
were curtained off with flags, and the band played
In one corridor, while guests entered f mm the side
opposite. At the doorway, members of the commit-
tee ranged themselves in two lines, through which
the guests passed, bowing as their names were an-
nounced, while the smiling committee bowed af-
fably in return. It did not seem necessary for all
ladles to have a male escort, some entered by them-
selves, or a mother and daughter together, others
on the arm of solid papas. By about a quarter-
past 9 o’clock the room was well filled, and a few
bars of the .National Anthem made every one look
to the door. False alarm. However, a few minutes
after, the band again began to tootle out the s ilemn
air—then His Excellency the Governor appeared
and was greeted by the committee. Behind came
Mr C. Rolleston, G. M.G. with Ladv Loftus, Mr.
Unwin escorted Miss Constable in a beautifully
combined toilette of blue and black; while the
fallant Lieutenant who first became known to
ame through emitting to “pass examination at
the Institute ’’ brought up the rear. Immediately
afterwards the sweet strains of the “Venetla’’
floated through the air, and one after another the
jewelled beauties were led from the crowd to sta t
In the swinging dance. The space available was
very limited at first, but after a time the crowd
drew back towards the walls, and the dancing
orbit uradually widened its circumference; and
in the meantime two “ blue-jackets ” in nice
clean clothes and straw hats came out with a blue
rope and hold it stretched across the room. Then
followed the “ Patience ” lancers, done in some i
sets by eight couples instead of four. There were
no quadrilles, the programme being mostly a
succession of soft, delicious waltzes. Listen to <
this list: Mvosotis, Dream Faces, My Queen, Thine
Alone, Auf Wiederschen, La Heine, The Old Love
and the New, Margherite, Dolores, Chant du Clel,
Visions d’Amour, and Silver Rhine. It's enough
to make the toes tingle still, played as they all were
by Koptf and Austin's fine string band, and in
their best style—though there is always a little ,
difficulty as to where a band should be stationed .
In the handsome Town Hall. Reversing was not
tabooed—at least, not by those who could do it.
Everyone could not, of course; even in an assem-
blage so full of fashion as that, a few laborious
dancers oould be seen persistently doing the old-
fashioned teetotum waifz, with a big dip on the
“one’’ to get up Impetus. After a few dances,
the oppressive warmth of the night became very
evident, and there was soon an exodus into the
passages and ante-rooms in search of cooler air.
Then it was that tender tales were told, ever so i
sweet to woman’s ear, so glib upon man’s tongue,
as the time slipped by—heedless of initials on the
forgotten programme, careless of the chill air In-
sidiously falling on bare white shoulders—in some
shadowy retreat. Here are a pair. They are very
interested; both are playing a game. Though she
Is young and it is novel to her, she feigns to be not
very attentive, and with fingers that wander in a
listless way over the snowy mass of dress falling in
cascades on to the floor, she carelessly touches a
frill or a bow in Idle adjustment. But he is ex-
Serienced, and as he goes on gently speaking 7n
lat soft voice that he keeps for pretty women,
the Insensible charm steals over her, and
the faintest tingo of colour hovers on the
whiteness of her neck. With shy modesty
the eyelids fall, the little satin shoe stops
tapping, and, as he leans over, and speaks lower
and more earnestly, the feather fan ceases to
flutter languidly to and fro and falls softly to her
lap: and then-a crash of chorda breaks the spell,
a streim of chatterers from the ballroom shows
that another dance is done, and they go back into
the glare. Perhaps he has said enough: perhaps
not. The light in her eyes will tell. It is a scene
so often rehearsed. And it is not always the man
who is the more experienced In it. The even flow
of the dreamy waltz, the wine that sparkles and
the tone that lulls, the low-curved dress in the
twilight corner, all help the actors in their little
parts. Very different were the prosaic elderly
gentlemen at their card-fables in a quiet rsora set
apart for them. Then another large apartment
was fitted up as a refreshment buffet to- light and
temporary relief, independent of Baumann’s
elaborate supper. While the bright-hurd belles
floated under the crystal chandelier la a gor-
geous moving mosaic of dressmaker’s art and wo-
manly shapeliness, around the walls stood many
of the portly gentlemen, who act as the pillars of
patrician (ooiety In Sydney The Chief Justice,
Sir James, is with Lady Martin, in a rich robe of
heliotrope satin, with side panels and bodice, out
square and low, of deep mauve velvet. Sir Patrick
stands by Lady Jennings, who wears a beautiful
white satin gleaming with diamonds on the breast,
and richly worked skirt. Mr Wigram and Lady
Allen are near by, and Commodore Ersklne, Mr. F.
B. ’Suttor, Mr. C. Rolleston, and others. Mrs.
Cooper wears a ddcolletd white satin and tulle
waterfall back, looking stylish, and is accompanied
by her sisters. The wife of a leading professor is
also in a rich white toilette. A beautiful girl from
North Shore floats freely in the dance in a black
net ballet skirt, loadt-d with flowers on one side,
the bodice cut low back and front in a deep U
shape, and edged with broad white lace. A tall
lady looks stately in a bright framboise broche,
with lace sleeves to match. Most exquisitely
proportioned is a white broche satin, the
small pointed bodice and Niagara skirt of
fine faille serving to display a form of
fierfeot grace. Birds’ plumage was much worn;
n < ne case a lovely white satin robe was rendered
conspicuous by two large green parrots, one on
the bust and one on the skirt The wearer of an-
other pretty white was observable for the brilliant
red geranium wreath on her hair the only reliev-
ing colour. A petite figure all in black wore
Immense white roses, like balls of snow over one
shoulder, with singularly happy effect. Two
young ladies wore veritable masher dresses that
are as yet novelties in the ballroom; they were all
black, with half-length sleeves, but the white
chemisettes and tall masher collars gave a really
piquant appearance. A splendid cream dress with
garnet broche tablier had a wealth of warm-hued
flowers ’.railed over the corsage. A North Shore
young lady wore an elegant white net, with satin
bodice and front draping, and a white aigrette in
her hair. Now, the old saying, “Two’s company, but
three’s none,” applies to colours as well as to com-
Eany, and It was specially so in a costume where a
right crimson skirt was draped with snow-white
India muslin, and topped with old pold satin bodice.
It was one colour too many. A shot pearl satin
was very obvious, and so was an unusual com-
bination of ficelle laco and blue corded silk. One
of the richest costumes was blue satin with a bold
“throw” in the pleated waterfall back, and broad
Sources of white lace on the skirt. One of the
most stylish dancers was a tall, dark lady, in lovely
amber broche and satin, with cerise scarf draped
over the back skirt. Two dresses of blue were
both a ike remarkable for being covered all over
methodically with gold spirals in all sizes. Soon
after 11, supper was announced, served d la carlo
in Baumann’s best style, in the large supper-room
at the back. Two lo g tables were choicely set for
the guests, who had to come in relays, as there was
not room for all, nearly 350, at once. The room
was exceedingly hot Then dancing was resumed,
and though some left early, the majority stayed
till past two in the morning, when the successful
ball of the Australian Club came to an end.

On Wednesday, 20th August, the com-
mittee of Moree School of Arts gave a good plain
and fancy dress hall to aid the institution. Room
decorated with flags, emblems, etc., and the word
“Welcome” prettily arranged In white and
soariet w « 1 opposite the door, by the secretary’s
wife. Dre-ses various and in good taste. Cream
satin broche and ruby velvet admirably became
the wife of the local Lands’ officer, and this lady
was voted the belle. The better-half of a surveyor
in cream satin also looked and danced well. A
young lady admired for her handsome pale blue
satin and broche; and the local medico’s wife wore
a nice black satin and broche. Other dresses that
pleased the fancy were, a plain white Indian muslin
worn by an unmarried lady; cream veiling with
peacock blue plush top; and black and old gold lace
looking well on two sisters. A young lady from
Millie was charming in cream and cardinal,
and evidently enenanted the bachelors. Among
the fancy dresses, Mary Queen of Boots by a mar-
ried lady was a faithful copy; and a /Huntress was
successful in black and gold, with scarlet ribbons.
Winter was personated in black and white, with
'• >'|y, by a lady who inspired no cold feelings,
foe postmaster’s wife was a Breton Peasant, and
the Doctor a Sir Joseph Porter, who carried the
palm among the gentlemen. A local land agent
wore Court dross; a station boss, a jockey costume,
which looked last; and an energetic J.P., as a
Knight Templar, sprang about In a way that
showed that while there’s life there’s hope. A
Jack tar, huctsman, footballer, and members of
the mystic crafts completed the list. About forty
couples were present. Messrs. Broderick and
Tibby provided capital music, assisted by Sir
Joseph. Supper was laid in an adjoining room,
tasteful programmes, efficient M.’s C. (especially
one), good spirits and dancing, set off a pleasant
evening, and the enjoyment only ceased as day-
light came.

On Saturday the Association Ground will
again be the scene of a sports exhibition given by
the amateur athletes of the Eastern suburbs. With
favourable weather. It will be a fine afternoon’s
lounge. Sports begin at 2, the Nelson band will
play, there is a three-mde bike race, and a tricycle
race for “ kiddles.” There will also be an attrac-
tive show of Spring dresses. These are not men-
tlo ed in the advertisements, but they are very
important.

On Saturday night nearly 200 gentlemen
were present at the banquet to Mr Henry Parkes,
Mr John Hardie, Mayor of Sydney, In the chair.
Baumann catered the dinner, which was de-
spatched quickly. The health of Sir Henry was
proposed by the Mayor, who had known Mr.
Parkes on the Empire, forty years ago, but he
didn’t suppose Mr. Parkes knew him, because at
that time—like Patience’s sweetheart—“ he was h
little boy.” In reply, the veteran politician made
a rather remarkable speech, lasting over an hour,
first explaining why he had not resigned his seat,
then alluding to the lamentable depth of demora-
lisation the Government had managed to reach
owing to his absence, adverted to all they hadn’t
done, and depreciated a Land Bill whioh they
founded on the old one, but with all Its good
features refined away, and its bad ones fearfully
aggravated. Then said Sir Henry, in conclusion.
“I never want to resume official life; daring 13
months’ freedom from political turmoil, I have,
for the first time in many years, really enjoyed
rest. The country has had enough of me, and I
feel that In my last administration I received a
most unjust reward of bitterness. I am not dis-
posed to forget it.” And the banqueters went
sadly away.

A very varied entertainment was given
last month at Wllcannia, in aid of the Athenseum
up there, which wants a new chimney or some-
thinc. The local millionaires filled the front seats,
but though a thin attendance at the back caused a
loss in the proceeds, the local paper cheerfully
observes that it was a much greater loss to those
who missed a delightful evening’s amusement.
This Dick Bwivcller way of looking at the matter
seems to indicate more philosophy in Wllcannia
than one would expect. Among the concert items,
Mesdames Cunnynghame and Forster, and Messrs.
Bailey, Pike, Chapman, Borlase, and Armstrong
(accompanist) were the leading stars; and the
comedietta “To Oblige Benson” was given by
local ladies and gentlemen with a good deal of
care, Mr. Forster, as Trotter Southdown, being the
best. The committee had conceived the idea
of a spelling bee, but, owing to their having
over-estimated the culture of the Wiloan-
nia population, this bee didn’t hum very
successfully. The fact is, the influential men
of the town who had any reputation for know-
ledge didn’t care to risk it. So, when the invitation
to go on the platform came, all the well-connected
people looked at one another as if they could spell
anything that they wanted—only they didn’t want,
forfear high-class education might possibly get too
common. So the spelling genius of Wilcannla was
represented by a sma'l company of small boys, and
a very pretty little girl whose charms so affected
the judges that, although she put in letters where
there wasn’t room and left holes where they ought
to have gone in, they gave her a special prize for
being so pretty. It’s a hard handicap for a boy
competitor to spell against a pretty girl. The
influential citizens were awfully glad when the bee
w»s over : somebody might have asked them to
spell a word.

Country parsons have a novel way of rais-
ing the “needful” when they require anew altar-
cloth or a few wax candles. At West Dapto, a ball
was lately held, under church auspices, in the old
school-house, which had been “tidied up ” for the
occasion, and was a decided success as to numbers.
There were many visitors from Wollongong and
Albion Park, but the attempt of the lady con-
tingent to wrest the honour of belle from their
Dapto cousins was not successful. “ Top Sa wyer ’’
was a-sumed by a piquant damsel from the latter
place, who dressed in remarkably good taste, and
donned an outfit of oatmeal cloth and tinselled
grenadine. Beach's colours were tastefully dis-
played on a biack dress by another Dapto girl; and
a visitor from Wollongong had a neat dress of
white muslin trimmed with crushed-strawberry.
Two sisters, in pink sateen, looked well; as did a
steady dancer in white muslin, with cardinal sash.
Dancing was kept up till four o’clock.
Officers of \lie Railway Department held
their annual gathering on 27th ultimo, at the Sir
Joseph Banks, the attendance being more numer-
ous thau any before. At 10 o’clock a pretty pro-
c< salon started from the tram terminus, the motors
and three cars being gay with flag and flowers.
Qt coarse, they were driven by steam as usual,
but the gins helped to “set them off” with win-
some smiles and fair faces In audition, a band
dispersed sweet music; and, in fact, altogether,
even an Alfred man could scarcely have looked
on those cars in their glory and caded them Jug-
gernauts When the grounds were reached on the
shores of the Bay, an attack was immediately
made on the sand-whioh-is there. This joku is the
result of the trams doing the Journey out in loss
than the regulation hour—such speed made ua
light-headed. Festivities of the day were very
varied, a long list oi sports, races, hurdle hops,
quoit matches, &o., the principal race, for a hand-
some trophy given by the Commissioner, being
won by Knox, with Log-fin second. A long
programme or dances was got through just
before seven o’clock. At lunch, Ministers Wright
and Dtbbs gave their presence, the former,
however, was not quite right yet from his severe
iflness, and the speaking was done by Mr. Dlbbs.
Catering would have been a great success, only for
the fact that, instead of the ordinary two-year old
chickens, the caterer had unfortunately made a
mistake and killed the valuable birds left at Botany
by Cant. Cook on his first visit. Railway officials
do not appear to be speech-makers—probably be-
cause they are in such a hurry, especially on the
Parramatta trains. So after Mr. Duwne had s ild
the Ministry had done a lot for them, Mr. Ritchie
that our railways are the best in the world, Mr.
Berners that we had so many millions of men and
money, and Mr. Townsend that he admired the
ladles, the railway officers once more sought the
giddy dance or the sylvan shades and their best
girls. And, about dusk, puff! puff! home.

Chatsworth, the residence of Mr. C. J.
Roberts, M.P., C.M.G., is one of the most delight-
fully situated houses in Potts Point, and few can
surpass It in any of the suburbs of Sydney. Re-
cently, extensive additions hare been made; a
billlard-ro m, 80ft. by 18ft., has been built behind
the dining-room: and over this, and extended
across the broad drive, supported by massive
columns, a ball-room, 60rt. by 30ft. and 22ft. high,
has been erected. On Monday last, about 700 ladles
and gentlemen accepted invitations tor the open-
ing ball, and most brilliant was the sight. The
entrance is from Wylde-street. The drive was
lighted with large Chinese lanterns, and at every
angle through the winding path which leads down
the garden to the water's edge the lights In lan-
terns of every colour glittered. One one terrace,
a summerhouse beguiled the dancers: onanother.
young couples admired the gorgeous foliage in a
conservatory. Lower still was a fernery, also well
patronised; and on the lawn, nearly on a level with
the harbour, a largo marquee was erected. The
band of the Permanent Force discoursed sweet
music, and the flashing rays from the South
Head lighthouse shed a special lustre around.
Looking upwards from the garden, the scene
was very picturesque; through every window
and door might bo seen gally-attlred ladies
moving amongst ferns, statues, and lights in
the broad verandah, on the staircases, and In
the rooms of the house; above, the balcony—
which surrounds the water-front of Chatsworth -
was enclosed with curtains, through which the
lamps shone brightly. This balcony was trans-
formed into a supper-room. Within, the scene
was gay, indeed; from half-past eight the arrivals
began and continued uninterruptedly until past
ten. The ball-room is entered oh the eastern side
from the terrace, and also from the corridor; at
the former doorway the host and hostess received
their guests. The terrace, which served as a
lounge between the dances, has a floor in imitation
of gray granite: It Is furnished with handsome
seats ot cast-iron, decorated with palms and other
Slants, well-lighted, and fitted with Venetian
linds—the iron railings and supports, In dark
maroon and gold, are very handsome. The ball-
roomlpresonted a magnificent sight. The guests
included the celebrities of Sydney and notabilities
from all sections of society. The ladles were
handsomely dressed, and as they moved to the
graceful strains of the slow waltz, the brilliant
colours of their robes.refleoted In the mirrors gave
a coup d’ceU of rare gorgeousnesa and splendour.
The hall Itself is probably the finest of Its kind
attached to anv private residence In New South
Wales. It Is fifty feet In length, by a width of
thirty feet, and decorated in a style hitherto
hardly attempted In private architecture In Aus-
tralia. At the north end Is the music gallery,
which on this occasion was tenanted by Mr, Hodgo
and a baud ot picked musicians. Dancing was kept
up with spirit until 3 a.m., and of the Hundreds
present every one endorsed Sir John Robertson’s
words, as, In proposing the health of the host and
hostess, he thanked them for their splendid hospi-
tality, referred to the mansion as an ornament to
the capital of N 8.W., and wished them long life to
enjoy the beauties of their home, and many more
opportunities ot sharing these pleasures with the
guests who had so delighted in the entertainment.
Certainly the 1st of September will be a red-
letter day in many a young lady's calendar.
The hostess was attired In a handsome light blue
satin, embossed In light blue velvet, with long
train and black Spanish aje draperies; her
three yomhful daughters in white tulieover white
silk. A handsome leader of society in black
lace and Jet over black satin, with bodice cut low
and short sleeves, looked extremely well, her hand-
some shoulders and arras showing to perfection.
The hostess wore pale blue satin covered with
black Spanish laoe. Lady Hay wore black, as also
did Lady Robertson; Mrs. G. R. Dlbbs, black satin
and sprays of flowers; Mrs. T. Burdekin, cream
and pale blue; Mrs. Devlin, a handsome salmon
pink dress; Mrs. Garran, black, and white lace;
Miss Dif be, black net; Miss E. Robertson, light
blue; Miss Q. Eagar, black net cooped up with
roses, and the upper skirt covered with cardinal
pompons: Miss E. B. Smith, pale blue striped satin;
Miss Parkes, cream satin; Mrs. Russell Barton,
black and maize; Miss Alexander, a pretty pale
pink costume; Miss Maclean, a rather sombre
royal blue; Miss Neill, pale pink and cardinal;
Mrs. Neill, black satin; and Miss Mackenzie, a
handsomo heliotrope broche. A recent bride ap-
peared in a stylish cream satin; and a pretty little
damsel with dark hair from a marine suburb,
was greatly admired; her sister in pale green
net looked attractive. A very elegant black
satin, made with stomacher and flounces of
gold tissue with peacock’s eyes, was very lovely.
A silver grey satin, embossed in ross colour, had
sleeves composed of.a network of pearls, also the
plastron worn over the bodice; very handsome
jewellery. A rich black iace dress had lacings of
cardinal satin killings, and was draped with black
net sprinkled with cardinal chenille pompons. A
light blue satin worn high to the neck was made with
Elizabethan stomacher, and hansomely trimmed
with peacock and gold tissue. Black costumes
were endless in variety and magnificence. A
crushed strawberry sa‘in, with <3cru lace drapery
and flounces, was tasteful; also a coral pink, with
laoe trimmings. A classic-featured debutante was
much admired, and wore white satin and silver
flounced all round, pointed bodice, with garniture
of water-lilies and terns—pronounced by many to
bo the belle. Another white satin had draperies
of white chenille pompom net, with waterfall
back. The wife of a member ot Parliament wore
an extremely handsome dress of French grey,
brocaded in velvet of geranium pink. An uncom-
mon dress was a fawn-coloured satin, the trim-
mings ot which were lined with coral pink,
and the whole set off with fringes of pearls.
A black iace, with here and there little
satin facings peeping out, was trimmed with
bunches of (.-old grapes. A iigbt-biue satin,
with ostrich feather trimmings in same shade, was
worn with high Elizabethan collar opening to the
wa'st over white laoe. Extremely beautiful was a
white lisse trimmed with gold, and worn over
white satin. A heliotropesaun flounced with black
laeo was adorned with flowers to match the satin.
And there was a white satis, with white Jet and
lace flounces; also, one with skirt made in broad
box pleats, with swansdown rulfies between ;oach
pleat. A great many of the dresses may have
been handsome at one time, but the wearers ev-
dently took Into consideration the crowded state
of the ball-room, and reserved themselves for a
time when their finery would have a better show.

The Cyclists’ Union had a lovely afternoon
for their races, and, considering counter induce-
ments on all sides, a very fair attendance of visi-
tors. The chairs placed all a'ong the straight run
and along by the winning post were much appre-
ciated by ladies, though some preferred the sunny
tei races because ot the higher ground. The racing
fields were unfortunately small, anc, after a
couple of spills early in the day, there was an !
element of apprehension in spectators’ minds as
the competitors came whizzing round the sharp
corners, at the idea of risky falls on such a hard
surface. A great deal has been done to the truck
to improve it. Sweet music was given by the
Naval Brigade band, and the young cyclists con-
stantly evoluting on their glittering wheels la the

Tam worth’s fourth, and last, Winter party
was held in the Oddfellows’ Hall on Thursday
evening. It differed from the preceding parties
by being fancy dress — optional*- although the
majority came in ordinary evening dress: still,
enough came in fancy to make a pleasant change.
The oeiieship was decidedly carried away by a lady
Ifrom New England, in cream satin and broohe. A
’•Daughter of the Uegiment ’’ and a bewitching
Ulttie “Nancy Lee” divided the honours among
the fancy fair; but there was nothing original or
■tarUlog—**Spanish Lady,” ” Mother Hubbard"
(very good), “ Shepherdess,” “ Scotch Lassie,"
“Quakeress,” “Ambulance Nurse,” &o.; “Soldier,”
“ tailor,” “ Policeman,” “ Fisherman,” “ Foot-
baller,” and “Cricketer” have all been seen at
scores of balls. Two sisters from Attunga, as
usuil, looked charming In handsome dresses of
heliotrope and wnite. Being the last, more people
were at this party, alth ugh some faces were
missed; and it was kept up later, the room not
being clear until about four o'clock. The Tam-
worth ventlemen have the girls’ thanks. They can
have the * Iris themselves by asking.

The plain and fancy ball inaugurated by
the storekeepers of Armldale was much yearued
for, and was very gay and picturesque when it
came. Promenading before the duuoing began
showed off the pretty costumes, and both stage
and balcony of tneTown Hall were thronged with
spectators. Tho dancing lasted from 9 till 4 30. The
trio of ladies most admired wore Harvest, Fairy,
and Young Australia. Harvest wore white satin
and nun'a-veillng. skirt looped with rainature
wheac-eheaves encircled with small reaping-hooks.
Fairy, in white and spangles. Young Australia
wore a dark blue bodice a"d skirt, adorned with
Australian flowers, and the Australian coat-of-
arms worked in crewels on her oostume. A good
many arms of coats were also worked round her
costume during the evening. A Highland Lassie,
and a dark lady as a Mexican Gipsy were
also much admired. A fair lady from Beardy-
street wore green satin as the Ooileen Bawn, and
looked nice> and a lady Gymnast danced well.
Two sisters (Tom Dumaresq-street, as Ivy Girl and
Oomiug-through-the-Jttye, were attractive: and a
fair lady, in pale-blue satin and silver stars, from
Barney-street, appeared as a worshipful Starlight.
Amongst other characters were Urania, Soubrette,
Spanish Lady, Night, Patchwork, Huntress, and
Mrs. Spoopendyke. The gentlemen likewise were
varied and interesting. At one o'clock, adjourn-
ment was male to the supper-tables, under care of
Mrs. Pitkin: the music was from a good trio, and
the bail satisfactory.

A series of Winter parties having been
given by oachelors at Newcastle, the young ladles,
after muoh grateful consideration of the benefits
they had received, Issued prettily designed invita-
tions for a complimentary party to the bachelors,
which toon place in the Protestant Hall on Friday.
By 9 o’clock, 61 couples were present. The hall
was tastefully decorated with ferns, evergreens,
and flags; a pretty casket of ferns and flowers
stood on each window-sill, and the platform was
carpeted. As each gentleman entered, he was
presented with a button-hole by one ot the com-
mittee, a lady. The whole affair (except four mar-
ried mofi'ers of ceremonies) was carried out by
ladies; h3 presidents being Mrs. T. Clack and
Mrs. J. (J. Ellis, and the committee Misses M.
Ash, E. Thomas (hon. see), £. Hicklnbotbam
(hon. treasurer), and H. Hall; and they were ail
distinguished by wearing bouquets of violets and
snowdrops. It was ;the first party the ladles
had given In Newoastles, and exceedingly
pleasant. There were 23 dances on tho programme,
one being a set of lancers for ladles only, who
must have practised, for those who took gentle-
m m s parts never made a mistake. Forty-eight
ladies danced, and the gentlemen gathered on the
platform and watohed Among the company, a
few of the most conspicuously hand ome dresses
were—Miss Thomas, in a beautiful black velvet,
and pale blue bows and glove*; Miss Hickio-
botbam, white India muslin and lace, pink belt:
Miss Crcer, a pretty blue satin and llama; Miss
F. Beeston, a white lustre skirt, and ruby
velvet bodice; Miss H. Hall, a [nice cream
cashmere, with cream satin ribbons and blue
gloves: Miss Llpman, red velvet bodice, pink
dress; Miss M. Ash, a charming white India muslin
and pale-blue bows; Miss Niokisson, a pink llama
and broohe; Miss M. Hlcklubotham, cream India
muslin and lace, also cardinal and pink bows. Miss
Hays old gold satin was rich; and Mias Leneren
wore a simple madras muslin of cream; Miss A.
Hall wore oream cashmere skirt richly trimmed
with cream satin, ot which the well-fitting bodice
was made. Light refreshments arranged in a
tasteful manner, and good music, helped to make
the ladies’ party a pleasant as well as graceful
compliment to the bachelors of Coalopolis.

A large number put in an appearance at
the Guudagai Quadrille Assembly, which, as 1 was
the final, toe committee decided snouid be in fancy
dress. The energetic secretary worked success-
fully, and elaborate aud tasteful costumes were
not wanting. Pretty “Nancy Lee ” was much ad-
mired; hersister, the “Duchessof Gainsborough,”
waltzed divinely, and never waited long for part-
ners. Mona Cottage and Greeudale Park were
both well represented—the former by “Snow,”
who seemed warm enough to thaw the hearts of
the local mashers: and the latter by a vivacious

a “ Highland Lassie.” Amongst other nice dresses
were those representing “Court Lady,” “Snow,”

Sydney, Wednesday.
My Dear Belle,—As I have before remarked
to you, when a man of merit is fortunate enough
to earn popularity in Sydney, ho is safe-quito safe
—for, granted that tne Sydneyites are slow to ac-
knowledge talent, still, when once their eyes are
open, their appreciation is as keen as it is liberal.
This was plainly demonstrated the other night,
at Herr Max Vogrioh's concert in the Exhibition
Building; for I do not remember over having seen
so large an audience at a benefit concert in Sydney
before. And this is the same Max Vogrlch who
used to play pianoforte solos at the Wilhelmj con-
certs, some years back; and there were only a few
of us amongst the shamefully thin audiences who
foresaw that the melancholy-looking pianist bad a
brilliant future before him. And it was neither his
sad face nor his long hair which imbued us with
the conviction that he was something out of the
common; not at all, though Ned used to declare it
was. He was so certain of this, that for a few
weeks he actually cultivated a sad visage and
allowed his hair to grow long; but when he found
that he was never by any chance mistaken for
either poet, musician, nor Lewis Scott, he gave
it up as a bad job, and became himself again.
But, about the concert. Of course, the chief
Interest was centred on Madame Vogrich, who
appeared in a rich ivory silk dress combined with
cerise satin. The front width was entirely of the
satin, ana the long handsome train of the silk. A
diamond ornament sparkled in her hair, and I
assure you, dear, she looked splendid. Lady and
Miss Alien wore black: so did Mrs. Gilles, but the
latter lady’s was enlivened by bunches of pink
feathers on the corsage. Little Miss Gilles looked
very pretty in a tasteful cream frock and her
beautiful hair Hawing loosely down h- r back. I
admired very much a dress of ruby plush, made
quite plain, and worn without a single ornament
of any kind. These rich materials are so much
better left alone to their own handsome simplicity.
Mrs. Kingsmill t?haw wore a cream-coloured
dress, but I wasn’t near enough to distinguish the
material. Whatever it was. it suited her admir-
ably. A most peculiar dress was of brown and
yellow check in a very largo pattern—rather out
of place fora concert-hall, 1 think, though ’twou d
have been effective enough for a walking
dress. The building, being fearfully draughty,
compelled many to cover their handsome toilettes
with clouds or opera cloaks. Of the latter a very
handsome one was composed entirely of pale blue
silk chenille, and I very much doubt whether the
dress it covered would h ive looked half as pretty J
Madame Kellermanu’s dress was black velvet, wiih
black feather trimmings. A white Elizabethan
collar, edged with pearls, made u nice finish to the
toilette. I was surprised to see so many long:
trains worn, and I am sure I was not singular lu
thinking it so wickedly careless to allow them to
trail on the sanded floor, just as if silk and satin
were to be got for nothing. Such vulgar, extra-
vagant wastefulness is truly abominable. I know
it is unnecessary for me to ted you anything of
the music, as you will learn all about that else-
where. uadame Vugrlch had several floral tro-
phies presented to her, one of which was a basket
of pure white flowers, and which was handed to
her by a very young but devoted admirer.
The Metropolitan Lledertafel concert, which was
held in the Protestant Hall on Friday night, was
almost as well attended as used to be the 8. Lledvr-
tafel when held in the same ha 1. Thtre is no
denying the fact that Herr Alpen has some rough
material to work up m, so it is hardly fair to com-
pare the efforts of the baby Lledertafel with its
not very ancient parent. But In order to make up
for any shortcomings on the part of the chorus, I
do think it would be wise to get the very beat
soloists the city can provide to assist. Now, with
ail due respect to my doir friend, the conductor.
I can't help thinking be lacked judgment in his
choice; but I may be wrong in accusing him, for
it is just as likely that it was somebody elae's fault.
But tbo fact of the matter is, we are just a little
bit tired of each of GUminona’s three songs, and
Madame Morz is only enjoyable when in her best
voi e, and she wasn’t on this occasion. Mr.
Hinchy I always, like in a simple ballad, but the
“ Message ” is out of his style In his second solo
ho was more successful; and. as for Mr. Reginald
Toms—why, a man who can plav well and chean’t,
should be treated like a naughty boy, i.e., he
should be whipped and stood in a corner. Miss
Palmer pleased us very much by her clever piano-
forte playing, and I was so glad she was encored.
She has a splendid memory, and is evidently
a careful student. Horr Alpen’s new vocal waltz
was warmly received, which was not surprising,
as it is, like all his compositions, extremely pretty,
t noticed in the small orchestra that young Smith
played first violin, and in the waltz he has a short
cadenza all to himself, and which, by the way, he
played with the coolness and ease which always
characterise his playing. The laughing chorus
was very infectious, for there was an old lady
sitting next us who did nothing but laugh for the
rest of the evening, and was very much disgusted
when the < ondu tor refused to answer the encore.
It was not strictly a full dress audience, ss many
wore their bonnets and even hats, and oh I tne
Protestant Hall is so dismal than even when the
dresses are nice they don’t show to advantage.
There is one thing L noticed about the singers
which, though it seems trifling, is more effective
than you would think. It is this. They all wear
their waistcoats cut alike, and showing exactly the
same amount of shirt-fron . Now tho Melbourne
Lledertafel do this, but not so the Sydney Li°der-
tafel, but it they knew how much nicer it looks
they would, I am sure. I suppose they think If
they can ph ase t he oar, it matters nothing for the
eye, but it docs, dear boys-it does.
I have heard something good about Miss Lydia
Hastings again. Last Wednesday, just as she was
about to open her “voice building” class In the
Arcade, one of her pupils (Mr. T. Slooombe) sud-
denly arose, and, after a short speech, presented
her on behalf of the class with a purse of sove-
reigns and an engraved complimentary address
conveying expressions of thanks and appreciation
for the benefits received under her tult on. I be-
lieve, in this case, the recipient was really and
truly taken by surprise, but she had sufficient
command over herself to make a neat but expres-
sive speech. The lady is evidently a great favour-
ite with her pupils, for she has had several presen-
tations during the past year.
Somebody—I don’t know who—has sent me a
copy of the “ llandwlok Galop,” composed by Miss
Essie Thomas, and dedicated to the Mayoress. It
is not a very ambitious composition, but at the
same time it is pretty, and I have seen tar, far
worse galops in print, and composed by men, too.
It opens thus:—
Now, I like to see a girl possessing sufficient cour-
age to place her own compositions before the
public; and I hope Miss Thomas will not stop at
the “ Randwick Galop.”
You complain that you have no day-time amuse-
ments but tennis and croquet, and wish me to
suggest something for you ? Well, I wonder you
don't follow that now fashionable pastime, “ama-
teur photography ” I do not think it is very
difficult to leaim the art, and just think what a
fund of enjoyment there must be in it. General
Bouuctt, who is manager for Tuttle and Co., tells
me that they manufacture what they call the
■ dry plates,” which go a long way towards facili-
tating photography, besides saving the lingers
from getting stained. He showed me how they
were made, but, although it was like A.B C. to
him, I confess I felt about as wise as ever when he
had told me all about it. But men take a delight
in puzzling silly girls, and I do believe they just
do it in order to show off their superior intellect.
But, anyhow, you just invest in a small camera,
and send to Tuttle’s for some of th»ir “dry plates,”
and I have no doubt, if you make a study of pho-
tography, you will not need to complain of want
of employment again in a hurry.
We are all impatience for to-morrow night, when
we are to hear Mr. and Mrs. Radeliff in the old
Masonic Hall. If only the stupid people who don't
go the concert knew what a treat they will have
missed, they would never forgive themselves. I
hope, for the credit of Sydney, the attendance will
be what it ought to be.
I have promised to go out with Edith, to help
her choose a new bon« et for the Eastern Suburbs
Amateur Athletic Club sports which are to be held
at the Association Ground, on Saturday next, and
to which everybody means to go-so by-bye, dear.

“ Dignity ”: You are mistaken. We do not object
to the Queen conferring the Order of the Garter
on the kid, Prince George of Wales. And we don’t
suppose Her Majesty would cure greatly if we did.
Our idea is that the more ridiculous such trumpery
distinctions are made by the manner in which they
are distributed, the better it will be for the chances
of a reaction to common sense. We maintain that
no one can confer honour upon an unworthy
object. What has the boy done more than your
own son, that he should be held uo for reverence ?
....“Anxious"; Not a bit of it. There is no small-
pox scare outside the S. M Hkualo and other
sensational Journals. Possibly Parkes and Stuart
feel a trill- anxious. But then, not everyone has
so much beauty to spoil “Bu»hman” (Ara-
mac): w e don t know exactly how Am-
man came by its name. We have heard a
tradition that it was in honour of R K
Mackenzie, once Premier of Queensland,' and
who subsequently succeeded to a Scoitish baro-
netcy as Sir Robert R. Mackenzie. R. R Mac. vou
bear. There s another yarn about “Arrah Mao "
’ Sundowner”; The composition of shanty rum’is
a dead secret. Inquire of any ghost you may see
hanging around a b't of a mound near any track
within twenty miles of a shanty. All ghosts of
that sort know about it.
It is rumoured in Washington that Dr
Mary Walker has declared, “once lor all,,’ that she
“wiU wear trousers or nothing:.” This Is exactly
the attitude assumed Just now by a set of English
ladies, who refuse to pay taxes because they can’t
vote.
Says Parkes, if you cannot carry on a
Government by reason and argument, and by a
fair meeting of votes, you must carry it out by
means that you dare not allow to see the light by
cajolery, raanosuvrlng, promising to meet this
wish and that other wish, promises to serve this
little interest and that other little Interest. Inti-
mate acquaintance with how it is done enables Sir
Gory to speak with authority on these measiev
points.

The proprietor of a London journal says

When Denmark ordered its magnilloent
field-artillery from Krupp, of Essen, the latter
asked Bismarck whether he would be permitted
to undertake the order. Bismarck replied, “ By all
means, let them have the very best and dearest; I
can always fetch them in case I want them.”
Concerning the Parisian anti-German de-
monstration on file day, the Pall Max.!. Gazette
says : “ Whatever fuss a certain portion of the

As a tremendous lot of blue-lire and black

Sir Henry Parkes informed a Rum re-
porter that propositions had been made to him to
take part lu an American Investment Company to
be formed in London. He also recounted ho w he
had been hob-nobbing with Jay Gould. Putting
this and that together, one gets a glimpse of the
probable truth. The ex-Chartist may yet be the
colleague of Jay Gould and Vanderbilt, and a
loading exponent of the Vanderbiltlan sentiment,
“The people be damned.”
Thus the N. Y. Herald, re Lord Rose-

least, is due to the House of Lords—that no Idea of

The undergraduates of Oxford and Cam-
bridge. writing in their own journal, say: Were
Socialism allowed Its way, not only would every
tic calculated to maintain social order, every
affinity between class and class, be destroyed, but
the adoption of the theory of equality, however
carefully hedged round with safeguards, would
certainly result in the creation of a mass of loafers,
who would refuse to work on the plea that they
have a right to adequate maintenance. The odd
thing about this is that the youngsters don t know
that the Socialist complains that the existing
system creates “a mass of leafers, such as nobles,
laud-owners, and annuitants, who refuse to work
on the plea that they have a right to adequate main-
tenance.”
Pronuttr! Proputty! At Devon Quarter
Sessions, a Mr. Halliday, the chairman, had before
him one John Dymond, charged with theft.
Dymond “had been left a widower with nine
children, the youngest only a week old. His
housekeeper robbed him of small stock of
money, sold his goods, and put the children lu the
Work-house. He was ordered to take them out,
and they were all turned out on the street without
either food or money. They had to tramp nearly
one hundred miles, and. after four nights out of
doors, they were all starving; so the miserable
man took four ducks from a farm-yard. He had
been refused admission to three unions, therefore
it was literally a ease of either helping himself or
of seeing his children die. He was sentenced to
five years’ penal servitude. No wonder that two
millions more of British democracy are clamouring
for votes.

a lino of forts extend up to Pagoda Anchorage,
where the river becomes unuavigablo for any but
the smallest gun-boats. If the Irench got them
lleet up to Pagoda Anchorage, they would have to
traverse fourteen miles of the rivor in boats
before they reached the city of Foochow, and this
would be an extremely perilous undertaking with
the Chinese attacking from the hills on either side
of the river.”
Writes “Stepniak.” in To-Day :—“I must
nail to the pillory of European opinion a charac-
teristic example of the position of women In
Siberia. It happened to Olga Lloubatovltch, one
of the heroines of the ‘trial of the Fifty at
Moscow, where the Socialist propagandists gained
to so remarkable an extent the sympathy or the
public. On the 30th August, 1883, on passing
through Krasnolarsk on tho way to her destina-
tion in Eastern Siberia, she was called before the
‘ isnravnik ’ (chief of the police of an arrondisse-
ment), who told her she must exchange her own
clothes for a convict dress. But as she was con-
demned to transportation by administrative order,
and not to hard labour, she had a right to wear her
own clothes. This she tried to explain to the
isnravnik. At her first words, however, he became
furious, and repeated that she must not only
change her dress, but do it there and then. In tne
bureau before everybody. To this most amazing
and unheard of intimation, Olga Lioubatovitch
answered by a categorical refusal. Then, at a sign
from the police-officer, his subordinates seized hold
of the prisoner in order to undress her by force.
A barbarous struggle ensued. This crowd of men
began to beat this women, to pull her hair and tear
off her clothes. So long as she kept her feet she
defended herself as best she could, but the chief of
the nolice by a violent kick felled her to the earth.
This is how she herself describes this infamy;— I
fell into a kind of stupor. I remember confusedly
how the heavy boot of the ispravnik struck my
chest. Someone was pulling my hair, another was
Striking my face with his fist; the rest were tear-
ing off my clothes, and at last, naked, crucified on
the floor, ia the presence of a crowd of men, I felt
all the shame and horror of a woman violated.
Frightened of their own deed, the cowards fled,
and when I recovered consciousness I saw around
me only my companions, pale as death, while
Fanny Moreiness was writhing in hysterical con-
vulsions.’ ”
“ The Lords,” remarks a London writen
“have been and gone and done it. They have
crossed the Rubicon and burned their boats, I
don’t know how wide the river was that separated
ancient Italy from Cisalpine Gaul, but the Rubi-
con the Lords passed when they did not pass the
Franchise Bill is a broad and swollen torrent, a
ravine- Hood that they will n.ever get back across
again to the land they left. Lf every peer were a
Webb and a Boyton rolled intfi' one the task would
stlli be Impossible. Nothing can ever give tne
poor foolish peers their old position. I am sorry
that the old relic of barbarism., hereditary legisla-
tion, will have to go so soon. It was a link that
bound us to the dear old dark skres. Still, the great
sea of progress will not be so wed. The old and
the useless structures that stand in the way of the
onward sweeping billows of refo rm must give way
at last and become the sport of '.the pitiless waves.
A coronet covered with muswls and limpets—a
robe caught in the seaweed—a bishop s mitre
battered and worn by the surge—these will be aU,
perhaps, that future wanderers on the shore where
the Upper Chamber once stood will find. The
silent sea will cover aU the reigt . . . Nothing
incapacitates an hereditary legislator from decid-
ing the fate of the nation. A peer mav drive from
a prison, or be brought from a lunatic asylum, to
vote away the people's liberties. An absolute
idiot, incapablo of jabbering two coherent words,
has if he is a peer of the realm, a right to sway the
destinies of the nation. Ttis a ghastly farce hal-
lowed by tbecenturies-this hereditary legislature.
It remains to be seen whether th« grandest, the
most intelligent, and the wealthiest democracy in
the world will allow itself to be insulted by the
farce actors any longer.—
“ TO THE G.O.M.
“ The foolish Peers, undaunted still,
"With daring hands throw out our bill;
Now, ’mid the people’s ringing cheers.
Our Bill will just throw out the Peers.

The title “Land Law Reform Alliance”
had a definite meaning which he who ran might
read and understand. “ Land Industrial League
means anything or nothing.. . .In the Commons,
Mr. Labouchere said he thought the number of
Foreign Service messengers and their journeys
might be reduced. When he was serving under
sir Henry Bulwer at Constantinople, he calculated
that one box of pills sent out to Sir Henry, who
was nearly always ill, or imagined himself ill, cost
between £1100 and £300. He, had also known mes-
sengers to be employed simply to carry letters
from the Queen to her German relatives on the
Continent To your tents, O Israel 1 The British
Franchise BUI has been scotched by thirty Peers
having voted one way Instead of another, and they
and their confederates did this like silly lambs, in
obedience to a mandate promulgated by Lord
Salisbury in the dining-room of his town mansion:—
The Lords, with tearful elocution.
Seem anxious for Redistribution;
What If the people dry these tears.
By redistributing the Peers ?
An American jury recently found that a
drunkard “died by hanging round a rum shop. ’
Another returned a verdict of “suicide in the
ninth degree,” and a third, after debating on a
long ease involving a hog worth seven dollars,
came In, found the hog not guilty, and recom-
mended both plaintiff and defendant to the mercy
of the Court.
“ Hurroo! Th’ foight’s begun, an’ thare’s
owld Finnyookln’s bald head sthlokin’ outffthralght
forninst me.” Delicately alluding to the beggar
opposite, the Gtmpib Mister says: “Our genial
friend over the way, who, by the way, looks like
a walking emetto, seems to be subject to an
occasional accumulation of bile, which not only
oozes through his skin and stagnates there to mud,
but he must squirt it over his neighbours. That
he should sympathise with those of his own class
was to be expected, and is, perhaps, the ono decent
trait In his character; but to loot for anything
approaching fair play or honest antagonism (of
course gentlemanly feeling is out of the question(
from such a source, why you might a a well expect
to find the grace of God in a goat-house.” This is
good, condemned good, indeed: and now’s the
time for our “ genial friend over the way ” to rise
up in his wrath and say, “ The dirty cur that slings
filth for the Gympie Miner seems to be offended
because we possess brains enough ta bring out a
really live paper, and he sobers up long enough to
give us a small quantity of the slime with which
his dirty, bloated, rotten, stinking, whisky-pre-
served carcase is tilled. If he has anything ‘ in ’ for
us, let him appoint a time and place to tire It off,
and we’ll be on hand to satisfy him. Now, you
wall-eyed, bandy-legged, cat-hammed, saveloy-
worrying son of a swamp angel reply to this, and
when you do, send us a copy containing your dirty
typhoid fever-breeding slush. D’ye hear that,
Ananias.” This Is the style of the retort editorial,
as it’s slung in the Far North.
Simple Simon—we beg pardon—Professah
Simon is scooping in a pile by fingering the bumps
of the inquisitive men of Goulburn, and the ex-
tent of the maudlin smile on the face of the galoot
who is told that he combines the wlffdo'm of a
Socrates with a passion for the ladles only equalled
by the late Mr. Brigham Young, or the present
Dan O’Connor, Is only equalled by the scowl on
that of the important citizen who is plainly told
by the blindfolded Professor that his cocoanut
holds a star combination of all the bumps that
were peculiar to the he >ds of Judas Iscariot, Ned
Kelly, Informer Carey, and the jackass-headed old
reptile who invented hurdy-gurdies. This, by the
way, reminds us of the man with mud in his ears
and whitewash on his pants who leaned over the
bar of the “Glucosers’ Rost” one day, and ob.
served: “Yes, sah: I'm a Iflzzyogenmist, an’ I kin
tell a man’s trade by the out ov his face: an’ you
better believe I’ve got the money at home that’ll
second my remarks. Now, you there in the frowzy
shirt—you’re a painter; I know’d it soon ez you
kem ia th’ door.” “ Wonderful,” exclaimed the
party addressed: “if I hed a gift like that I’d make
neaps o’ money, an’ hev a shot fur a seat in Parlia-
ment. Was ho on to you, sir?” “Ho was,” re-
plied the man, who said, “ A little more bitters in
mine this time, Jorge;” “soon ez ever he see’d me
he steps right up, an’ sez, * Mate, you’re a hatter,'
an’ then I laid down right away. Not that I ever was
a hatter, but my first wife’s step-father’s brother
was, which makes the allusion all the stranger.”
“ By thunder! that’s wonderful,” returned the
man with the dirty shirt; “and 1 ain’t a painter,
either; but my wife made me whitewash the fowi-
house yesterday, an’ I s’pose that gives my face u
sort of hartistlo hang. How d’ye do it, sir?’
“ Can’t explain it,” said the physiognomist; “but
I never fail. Bee that man loanin’ agin’ th’ filter
an’ feelin’ about fur more pickles ? Well, that
feller’s a labourin' man, an r drives a nocturnal
vehicle That’s hie business, an’ you better step
right along an’ convince y’r elves that th’ science
can’t go wrong.” The man who wanted more
bitters in his started off, accosted the cold beef
and gherkin worrier, and returned radiant with
delight. “ Most curious thing I iver heard of in all
me life,” he observed, as he beckoned to “Jorge”
to set ’em up again; “ I nope I may be painted pea-
green if I can tell how you does it.” “ Struck it
agin, hev I?” chuckled the scientist; “told y’go-
th’ thing can't fail." “ So it seems,” replied the
other: “ you get closer an’ closer every time. You
said that duffer overt here driv a night-cart, an’ I
wish I may die if he doesn’t own up that he’s
editor of a religious weekly paper. I’d give a
forchin t’ hev your gift, sir.” Just then the pro-
fessor thought he heard a man calling him outside,
and the stance ended.
This will interest the Sydney “Social
Purity Society.” The House of Lords has passed a
“ Bill for the better protection of young females”
from molestation. Of course the policeman is the
man selected to carry out the work, and it is fair
to say of him that he is, at any rate, a better pro-
tector of young women than are the clergy, despite
the fact that now and then a “mlmber av the
foorce” does get into trouble with the girl who
begins by handing him the cold meat ana bottled
stout at the back gate. But there is no real pro-
tection in lessening the responsibilities of girls and
women, and crippling their at present leeble op-
portunities of acquiring strength by independence
—to say nothing of adding to their already ample
opportunities or trumping-up a-j ainst men charges
in which the defendant’s chances of getting a fair
trial are prejudiced by the fact that they have
often only their mere statements to offer as against
the oath of a cunning woman, backed up by slight
corroborative evidence. The Bill passed by the
dear, good Lords, makes it an offence punishable
by imprisonment to speak in the street to a woman
you don’t know. This kind of legislation seems
to have a peculiar kind of fascination for
old men, Lords and Bishops especially; per-
haps it reminds them of their salad days. Be-
tween it and the question of the disposal of the
caricature statue of the Duke of Wellington, the
Lords have divided one-half of the time of the
session. It is the only subject upon which their
lordships seem entirely at home; the hoary sinners
gloat over the details of prostitution and Infamy.
Now, if there were any use for Bishops in the
House of Lords, one might think it would be in
connection with this Bill. But, what was the
action of the spiritual Lords ? Not a word of sym-
pathy for the frail creatures whom the Soolely,
which these hypocritical churchmen support, has
driven on the streets, was heard. Not one word!
On the contrary, that obsequious Pharisee, the
new Archbishop of Canterbury, made a speech, in
which he advocated the strongest measures of
coercion against the poor Hagars and Magdalene
No talk of moral suasion; fashionable Churchmen
could not stoop to save the fallen; they advocated
only the arm of the policeman. As soon as the
new and delicate duties of the police come into
operation, each constable will be pi ovlded with a
six-penny book of etiquette, a bundle of tracts, a
book of tickets for admission to midnight meet-
ings for distribution, and Lecky’s “History of
European Morals.” Every policeman will be a
married man, and will always be accompanied by
his wife. A jury of matrons will be kept in con-
stant attendance at all police stations. All the
stations will be in direct telephonic communica-
tion with the Lord Chamberlain, who will send an
official on application to identify such lady pri-
soners as pretend that they have been presented at
Court. Members of the House of Lords will be al-
lowed to bow to ladles in the Royal parks and the
West-End thoroughfares only if they—the Lords-
wear their robes and coronets. In view of the Act
passing through the Commons in 1 s present form,
the following table has been prepared, and will
shortly be posted on the doors of all the parish
churches:—A man in the street may kiss his grand-
mother, grandfather’s wife, wife’s grandfather. A
man in the street may shake hands with his father’s
sister, mother’s sister, father’s brother’s wife. A
man in the street may nod to his sister’s son’s wife,
wife’s brother’s daughter-, wife’s sister’s daughter.
The police have orders to arrest any man kissing,
shaking hands with, or nodding to any female re-
lative within the prohibited degrees.
“THE BULLETIN” PRIMER—LESSON VIII.
R. stands for Rash. A man is said to be Rash
who un-der-takes more than he is a-ble to do.
The man in the pic-ture is a Rash man, be-canse
he has un-der-tak-en to clean a Syd-ney Po-lice-
man’s boots. All po-lice-men have big feet, and
that may be the rea-son why they walk so slow-
ly that the row is al-ways over be-fore they get
there. Once a po-lice-man chased a man with
two wood-en legs. The man turn-ed round a
cor-ner, and es-caped. A po-lice-man nev-er
keeps house; he finds it more con-ve-nient to
sleep on his beat, and eat cold meat pies thrown
to him from the back kit-chen win-dows. They
e-cou-o-mise their time, and sleep with their
mouths open to catch the meat pies thrown at
them. Once, a naugh-ty, bad boy saw a po-
lice-man a-sleep, lean-ing a-gainst the lamp-
post, with his mouth o-pen. The boy threw a
cob ble stone in the po-lice-man’s mouth, and
he be-gau to chew it. “What a lot o’ sand
there was in that one,” he mur-mur-ed sweet-ly
in his skep. Po-lice-men seem to have a lot
of sen-ti-ment. I once saw one squeez.ing the
hand of a red-head-ed cook with one hand and
eat-ing a sav-e.loy with the other.

AYER'S PILLS,
A large proportion of the diseases -which
cause human suffering result from derange*
ment of the stomach, bowels, and liver,
Ayer’s Cathartic Pills act directly upon
these organs, and are especially designed to
cure the diseases caused by their derange-
ment, including Constipation, Indiges-
tion, Dyspepsia, Headache, Dysentery,
and a host of other ailments, for all of
which they are a safe, sure, prompt, and
pleasant remedy. The extensive use of these
Pills’ by eminent physicians in regular prac-
tice, shows unmistakably the estimation in
which they are held by the medical profes-
sion.
These Pills are compounded of vegetable
substances only, and are absolutely free from
calomel or any other injurious ingredient.
A Sufferer from Headache writes;
“Ayer’s Pills are invaluable tome, and
are my constant companion. I have been
a severe sufferer from Headache, and your
Pills are the only thing i could look to
for relief. One dose will quickly move my
bowels and free my head from pain. They
are the most effective and the easiest physic
1 have ever found. It is a pleasure to me to
speak in their praise, and I always do so
when occasion offers.
\V. B. Page, of W. L. Page & Bro."
Franklin St., Richmond,Va., June 3,1882.
“I have used Ayer’s Pills in number-
less instances as recommended by you, and
have never known them to fail to accomplish
the desired result. We constantly keep them
on hand at our home, and prize them as a
pleasant, safe, and reliable family medicine,
FOR DYSPEPSIA they are invaluable.
J. T. Hayes.”
Mexia, Texas, June 17, 1882.
The Rev. Francis B. Harlowe, writing
from Atlanta, Ga., says: “For some years
past I have been subject to constipation,
from which, in spite of the use of medi-
cines of various kinds, I suffered increasing
inconvenience, until some months ago 1
began taking Ayer’s Pills. They have
entirely corrected the costive habit, and
have vastly improved my general health.”
Ayer’s Cathartic Pills correct irregu-
larities of the bowels, stimulate the appe-
tite and digestion, and by their prompt and
thorough action give tone and vigor to the
whole physical economy.

It was admitted the other day by the par-
ticularly pious Lord Shaftesbury, who is chairman
of the English Commoners in Lunacy, that for the
keeper of a private lunatic asylum to send his own
people to arrest a patient and convey him to the
asylum Is a possible and even a permissible pro-
ceeding.
A Glasgow idiot or humourist is permitted
by the editor of the Times to publicly suggest that
“ It would be a wise and noble thing for France to
burn Toulon and Marseilles before the cholera
finds another seat, and confide in Christianity for
the cost.” Hut Glasgow Isn’t the only place where
some people’s highest conception of Christianity
consists in consigning to future conflagration
whatever or whoever happens for the moment to
be obnoxious.
While French cannon were thundering
around Foochow, there were other things happen-
ing. People were speculating on the upshot of
French interference in Asia. It is reassuring, how-
ever, to know that in the speculative hurly-burly
the Australian press has not lost Its head. Proof:
“ The Cowra coach was eompletely wrecked on
Friday week, through the horses bolting. No one
was on the vehicle, and the animals continued in
their mad career as far as Berry’s, at the One-Mile,
where the final catastrophe took place.
He was a cautious cuss, and when he was
reminded that he was on his oath, and requested
to state what was his opinion of the defendant s
character for probity, he smiled a sickly sort of
smile, and replied: "Well, really, I never gave
the thing much thought, but if I happened to be
the pastor of a church in which the defendant was
a deacon, I’d never allow him to pass round the
contribution-box, unless he was provided with a
bell-punch, like the tramway guards, to register
all the cash collected.” Then the gentleman for
the defence said the witness could step down, and
the party behind the spikes turned green with
suppressed gratitude.
Amongst the won-
ders of science shown at
the last South Kensing-
ton Exhibition was a re-
pulsive-looking sort of
instrument which at the
first glance might be mis-
taken for a whisky demi-
john that had spent a bad
night In the editorial de-
partment of the Shroud,
but which in reality was
an extremely scientific
weapon called the Ple-
thysmograph. From the
summary of its descrip-
tion, we learn that the
Pletbysmograph Is an in-
strument for measuring
the fullness of the limbs,
and when a theatrical'im-
prestario is armed with
this it is simply impossible
for any traudulently-in-
ollned nymph of the bal-
let to fool him with a
mixture of sawdust and
wadding in lieu of good
substantial calf - brawn
and well-developed mus-
cle. But the Pletbysmo-
graph has far higher alms
in the realms of science
than this, for a little
further along we read:
“ The whole of the fore-
arm of a subject being
Immersed In water in a
glass vessel, the cover of
India-rubber grasps the
arm with a water-tight
grip. Every enlargement
or contraction of the
arm by the inflow of ad-
ditional blood or the
withdrawal of the usual
amount causes a differ-
ence in the bulk of the
arm, whioh affects the
pressure on the water.
This is connected by a
pipe with a recorder, and
it is shown that if a de-
mand is made for blood
In the brain by unusual
brain action, it is neces-
sarily withdrawn from
the extremities; hence it
is claimed that this ap -
paratus can be used for
testing the Intensity of
brain action. It is stated
that a classical scholar
tested with a Latin and
Greek book showed more
blood needed for brain-
work to read Greek than
Latin.” Here, then, is au

periments proved that

fore, safely recommend

The other day a wood and coal merchant
was found with his head resting heavily on the
desk and groaning fit to split a knotted log. “ It’s
no use,” he muttered, “it’s no use -It’s got to be
done.” “ What’s got to be done ? ” asked one of
bis carters. “Everything,” bemoaned; “expenses
must comedown; your wages must come down;
give that horse less corn, and take notice tha*
your wages will be two shillings a day, instead of
three.” “I can’t live on it,” said Hodge. “You’ll
have to do it. Look at that! ” he roared, pointing
to The Bulletin cartoon of a Ton of Wood.
“ You’ll have to do it. The game is up. After
that, the ton will have to be raised to the old
weight—fifteen hundred.”
Renan, in the preface to his “Nouvelles
Etudes d Historic Religieuse,” expresses a wish to

Monsieur Joseph Ernest would, w©
doubt not, fain be selected into the role of Por-

“ Her vespers done,
Of all its wreathed pearls her hair she frees,

Loosens her fragrant bodice,”
and so on, as described by Mr. Keats.
The Cooktown Independent really used
to be a lively paper. It was a pleasure to read it,
for then it was all about how the editor got plugged
in the nose about four times a week, and bow
drunk all the other editors were, and how he had
startling disclosures all .ready to wheel out-to-
gether with stern intimations that he was going to
elevate Gehenna, generally. But now they’ve
knocked all the stuffing out of him, as will be seen
by the present headings of his paragraphs. Mark:
“Small Debts’ Court; Revenue; Municipal Coun-
cil; The Blacks [1]: Escort; The Bridges; The
Byeretown Road; Tropical Agriculture; The Vol-
unteers; Normanby Reefs.” They have evidently
taken the hawk from the Fowler, and slung him
the dove.
Ever since the very much bygone days
when “ Adam delved and Eva span,” the question
of what constitutes a gentleman has been the
subject of innumerable controversies. Aristo-
phanes, in that cheerful little comedy of “ The
Progs,’ 5 which he “dashed off” something like
2000 years ago, makes one of his characters, Abacus,
exclaim, “By Jupiter the Preserver, your master
is a perfect gentleman!” To which Xanthias, the
servant, replies. “ Most assuredly he is a perfect
gentleman, inasmuch as ho knows only how to
drink and mix up with troll-me dames.” Later
critics define the term to mean any man who can
wear a full evening dress rig out without being
mistaken for a high-toned cafd waiter; but one
Master Souazzi, a little Italian lad of Wellington
(N.Z.), goes more fully into the matter, and In a
recent school essay declares: “My ideas of what
constitutes a gentleman Is kindness, good manners,
no shyness. Straltfourdeness, walk straigt. Not
to proud, no tlaht boots, no tight fitting gloves,
don’t suck cane handles, ware your hat strlght.
don’t wink at ladies passing in the street, always
take your hat off in entering a house, don’t twirl
your bat on your finger, don’t smoke in a com-
pany of ladies. Never have to big of a flower in
your button hole, don curl your fringe In front,
don’t be sulkey; never call anybody by nickname,
never start a row. Never let love matters trouble
your Brain, never get excited, don’t get drunk
to often. Never cough, not if you can help it. Be
Courteus to Laldes. Never swear. Go to church
every Sunday, don’t pass remark, never tell
Lies. ’ Barring the last remark, Master Scuazzl’s
essay sounds extremely sensibly, indeed.
“ God loves a generous giver ” is the proper
preface for a tale from Louth which tells of a
certain Louth lady, who. whilst collecting for the
Cobar convent a few days ago, balled up a wealthy
geebung, who gave her £1 towards the deserving
mission. Shortly after this, the distinguished
donor of the “flimsy” came to Sydney, and it is
alleged that the whole of his chat on the way
down and back was a glowing panegyric on his
own generosity towards the “ poor Roman Cawtho-
lic party.” When this became known at Louth, it
was resolved that too much publicity could not be
given to the matter, and, furhermore, that it w«s
positively unjust to alio v the noble-minded, back-
block Peabody to be at the loss of the whole
pound, and, accordingly, a select committee made
a house-to-house collection, raked in a penny from
each, and then sent the bag along to gladden the
heart of their charitable to wnsman. His sleep is
less troubled now, and the extent of his smile
would shoot a pang of envy through the heart of
Tommy Bmpson.
Here’s a neat little ad. from a Northern
journal: “ Lost, Cameo brooch, representing Venus
and Adonis on the Dunmore-road, about .10 o’clock
on Tuesday night.” Delicate sort of subject to
adorn a maiden’s breast, is it not? Personally, wo
have no wish to hurt the feelings of either the
giddy Mrs. Vulcan or her nice young man, but, at
the same time, we feel bound to state that their
conduct on the Dunmore-road on the night in
question has Dunmore to corrupt the youth of
that district than anything else that has happened
since Mrs. Potiphar tore the shirt off Joseph’s
back; and, were it not for the dread of the ven-
geance of the Evenooze, we fee) confident that
Adonis would bo immediately flogged, and his dis-
sipated companion boosted up under the Vagrant
Act for six months. Mr. Shakespeare knows ail
about their little game, for he was leaning over
the fence when the female offender exclaimed—
“ Pie I lifeless picture, cold and senseless stone.
Well-painted idol, image dull and dead;
Statue, contenting but the eye alone,
Thing like a man, but of no woman bred.’’
Ohl she was a nice cup of tea, was Mrs, Yuloan,
Rather a lively scene is reported as having
happened at the last winter quadrille party held at
Orange, in which it was plainly shown that the life
of a country M.C. is not exactly one continual
round of bread and cheese and kisses. It appears
that the legally-ordained baud having stepped
outside to “see a man,” a lady present, very
obligingly began to rattle a polka out of the hall
piano, when a new arrival, dropping his partner,
stepped up and yelled, “Here, who told vou to
play a polka ? I want a waltz.” The polite M.C.
replied that he did. “ And what have you got to
do with it?” demanded the other; “you appointed
youahself.” M.C.: “ But I’ve paid my money, and
have as much say in this mattah as you have.”
After this, the courteous guest walked round the
room inquiring of the members if they had ap-
pointed “ this person ” to rule the revels. As the
new-comer happened to have the reputation of
being a gentlemanly copy of Slogger Sullivan, the
majority of the members went back on their old
M.C., who has acted all through the past quarter;
and were it not for the good sense of a fair peace-
maker, It is said the polka party would now be
M.C. in the locil hospital. Cheerful little scenes
like this do much towards inuucing persons to
enjoy themselves-at home.
The Kalizoic age has fairly boomed at last,
and in future all things will be lovely, and all con-
versation of the most culchawed and refined
nature that the most crack-brained aesthete could
ever hope for. This was particularly brought into
notice a few weeks back, when an amorous coster-
monger named Peter Yaggers was hauled up at
the Bow-street Police Court on a charge of having
unmercifully “biffed” his wife. Peter’s deferfee
was that hlsspouse called him a “body-snatching
thief,” and he at once “corrected her.” Mrs.
Yagger’s version of the affair, however, was
slightly different, and went to show that when her
husband came home he told her to clear, as he had
“got her betters,” and then, letting her have a
postman’s knock between the eyes, aesthetically
observed that he’d “fade her bloomin’ face for
her.” Further enquiries revealed the fact that
upon other occasions the high-toned Mr. Yaggers
declared he would ‘ tint her eyes,” “depress her
nose,’ and one night, being more than usually
refined, he let her have a John L. Sullivan pol-
thogue in the mouth, and exclaimed, “There, I
guess that'll decay your dentals for you.” Our
Waterloo heroes, with their “bags,” “nit,” and
“c o.” are a long way behind thei? brother vags.

This is the first of the charters of the city
of London:—“ William the King greets William
the Bishop, and Godfrey the Portreve and ail the
Burghers within London, French and English
friendly. And I make known to you that I will
that ye be law-worthy, as ye were in the days of
King Edward. And I will that every child be his
lather’s heir after his father s day. And 1 will not
suffer that any man do you any wrong. God keep
you." There is about all this a strong smack of
off-hand good-nature and good-fellowship, for
which we look in vain among the monarchs of later
days. The times of “ William the King ” are gone.
William the Bishop finds now-adays, pretty well
all over the world, that his teeth are chipped, and
nobody takes any notice of poor Godfrey the Por-
treve. The Bishops have become not less fond of
good living than were the ecclesiastics in the time
of the Friar of Copmanhurst, but they are a good
deal less candid, and, believing less, are a great
deal more worldly. How, for instance, would this
sound from the pen of (say) the Bishop of Northern
Queensland?—
“ Back and side go bare, go bare,
Hand and foot grow cold;
But belly, God send thee good ale enough.
Jolly good ale and old.”
The author of the foregoing lines was the most
Reverend Father in God, John Still, Bishop of
Bath and Wells, who lived long after London’s
first charter. If he lived in these days, it would be
alleged that he was an illicit Still.
It was quite in keeping with the good old
English way of doing these things to find that at
the recent Exhibition in London which was de-
signed to elucidate the laws which govern health,
the unfortunate waitresses in attendance had to
stand on their poor little tootsey-wootseys for
eleven hours a day. We need scarcely say that
these pooah ereechas were not under the fatherly
care of Brother Woseby. Although, by the way,
we have a hazy recollection of having, upon at
least one occasion, seen his Coffee Palace waitresses
so excruciatingly tired that they wera forced to
rest themselves on the knees of a lew of their
favourite customers. This, however, was late at
night, and in the heat of Summer when the mer-
cury in the thermometers used to crawl out
through the top of the “chubes” and sit in its
shirt-sleeves to keep itself from evaporation.
Mr. Frederick Crook recently lectured to
the Wellington Free Thought Association on the
“ Lights and Shadows of London Life.” J he
shadows were more conspicuous than the lights.
When in London recently Mr. Crook said he visited
a thieves’ soup-kitchen, where any hard-up bur-
glar or stock-broker could get a plate of soup aid
a lump of bread for a penny. In this establish
meat all the spoons, knives and forks, &c., were
chained to the table. The soup was served in
basins sunk and rivetted Into the table. It was
brought from the kitchen in a big syphon, which
the waiter carried on his shoulder. When a thief
called for soup the liquid was sent whizzing into
his dish with a head on it; but when he said he had
forgot his purse, and would pay for it to-morrow
the waiter replied, "Oh, no, you don’t. It’s not
good enough,” and then, without further re-
mark, he thrust the nozzle of the syphon into
the soup, and, presto, before a cat could jump, the
soup was gone, every drop of it—back again into
the syphonic tureen, and the dish and customer
were left empty and hungry together. There wa
no tick(et) for soup at that establishment.
Justice is usually re
presented in a blindfold
condition,but up the Dar-
ling she sometimes slips
the bandage from at least
one eye. There is a story
told of a Police Magis-
trate who, many years
ago, used to boss the situ-
ation in that region, and
hold the scales of justice
with a pretty steady hand
He was a good judge of
horse-flesh, too, and
whenever he saw a clean-
limbed animal having
symptoms of breeding,
ho yearned to psssess it.
And he’d have it, too, if
the remotest chance ex-
isted of securing It. One
day a bold shearer came
into a township in the dis-
trict, riding a handsome
thoroughbred, and he
duly set to work with the
laudable intention of
melting his hard-earned
cheque in the most ap-
proved fashion. In the
meantime, the P.M. spot-
ted the showy horse, and
determined that he won Id
have it at any risk. So
he interviewed the shear-
er, and made a liberal
offer of ready cash for
the animal, which the
owner as promptly re-
fused. As all things com©
to those who wait, so It
was in this case. While
enjoying his carnival in
the township, the noble
shearer got filled with
rum one day, and when
the police collared him
he was punching the
head of a resp cted citi-
zen, who, in an un-
guarded moment, de-
clined to drink with the
misguided, though hos-
pitable, bushman. Next
morning, he appeared
before the bench in a
sadly demoralized condi-
tion, with damaged
clothes and mutilated
features, and when the
constable had finished
with the interesting de-
tails of the capture of
the prisoner, and the
particulars of the affray,
the following dialogue
took place :—His Wor-
ship : “So you’re here,
eh ? Now, what have you
got to say ? ” Prisoner :
“Nothin’, yer Worship.”
His Worship : “ Well,
then, have you sold that
horse yet ? Prisoner :
“ No, yer Worship.” His
Worship: “I’ll give you
£20 for the animal—are
you on ? “ Prisoner (who
loves his horse): “ I don’t
like to part with him, yer
Worship.” His Worship:
“Well, you can take your
choice — £20, or three
months.” Prisoner (who
loves his faithful steed,
but prizes his liberty
better) : “ I’ll take the
£20, yer Worship.” And
there was revelry in the
township for three days
before the s b e a r e r
trooped wearily away
with half a bottle of run>
to regulate the jimji'ms;
and a whisky bust head-
ache that lasted him a full!
week.
If the whole of the fashionable audience'
whioh crowded up to hear Mendelssohn's superb
music to “ Antigone ” the other night were asked
what really induced them to attend the show, and
if each one in reply told the truth, the whole
truth, and nothing but the truth, bow many do
you think would declare they attended for the
sake of the drama and music solely ? Ten ' Oh,
come, hang it all, that’s a trifle too rough. We
should say there were quite a dozen, it not more.
Apropos of this, we had the playshaw of being
seated exactly behind a pompous old First Family
mamma, who, with her three deah daugbtabs,
spread out in front, and kept up one incessant
gabble from the first note of the overture to the
last of the grand finale. It was devilish interest-
mg, too, and part of it ran along in this style:—
Mamma, as the first allegro began: “ Oh, dean me,
Pauline, do you remembah how pooah deah Ret-
ting used to play that for us, at our little evening
pawties ?” Pauline: “ Oh, ma, how could one evah
forget those delightful evenings; especially when
Maudie’s favourite, Paladlni, used to drop in and
warble duets with her and Arabella? ” Maudie:
“Yes; and how jolly the daah old Commodore
used to make himself, tool He was positively in
love with mamma; now, wss he not?” Mamma:
" Tut, tut, girls, don’t talk so foolish. We were
simply congenial spirits, nothing moah. Lord
Lobbyjob was my favourite. You remembah, he
came with the Polish CountDonebrownski—lovely
tenor voice the Count had. Who’s this cornin’ on
now?—Anty-po-ny’s sistah, I presume.” And so
on all through, until we felt that we would wUl-
ingly swap our Immortal soul for the loan of a
dead cat to belt those culchawed creechaws over
the ears with, for of all the phases of pride, this
talking for the benefit of persons around is the
most pitiful and contemptible.
