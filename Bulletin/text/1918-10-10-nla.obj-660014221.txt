BEFORE THE MIRROR
By “JEANNETTE.”
These are, undoubtedly, days of exceptional nervous strain for one and
all of us. Anxiety, with its beauty-destroying- influence, is casting its shadow
over the lives of many of us women, and while perhaps a few—the more
stoical among us—can avoid worrying over past and prospective events, we
may all, with a little care and forethought, succeed in preventing the results
of worry from being noticeable in our appearance l . To these fortunate
few this little chat will, however, be as interesting and instructive as to
those who stand in real need.of help in toilet matters, and may be the
means of bringing to their notice some hitherto unknown method of retain-
ing or regaining that beauty of face and ligure which- is the birthright of
every woman. Some of the ingredients mentioned below are, at present, not
generally known to the public, but any good chemist will usually be found to
have a small quantity in stock.
A Beautiful Complexion by Natural Means.—
The secret 'of a perfect complexion lies in the
continual renewing of the outer cuticle of the
skin. This is Nature’s own method. The
outer skin as it becomes coarse or shrivelled
must be removed, and an opportunity given
to the liner one beneath to show itself. It is
because the old, dead skin is allowed to re-
main on the face that so many women, and
even young girls, suffer from pimples,
blotches and sallow dull skins. To remove, by
absorption, the dead outer skin, and with it
all blemishes, the use of mereolized wax is
universally recommended, ordinary face
creams being powerless for tbis purpose.
Smear tlie- wax over tlie face and neck, rub it
gently into the skin, and leave it on all night.
In the morning wash it off, using Pilenta
soap and warm water, when all the dead skin
will be removed with tlie wax. Then apply a
lotion to prevent any trace of greasiness
being noticeable and to give a peach-like
bloom to the skin. A lotion to do this can be
made up quite cheaply from the following
recipe: Take one ounce of cicminite and dis-
solve it in four tahlespoonfnls- of hot water.
Place in a bottle, and when cool apply to the
face with the fingertips, allowing it to dry on
tiie skin.
To Remove Blackheads.—Dissolve one effer-
vescing sty mol tablet in a glass of hot water
allow-the effervescence to subside, then dip a
small sponge into the liquid and mop over the
face. Allow it to remain on for a few min-
utes, then wipe off with a towel, and the
blackheads will be entirely removed. To prp
vent them from re-appearing, use a stvmol
tablet in the manner described twice a week.
How to Shampoo.—Before shampooing the
hair dip the lingers into a little pure olive or
almond oil. and. thoroughly massage the scalp.
Then dissolve a teaspoonful of stallax granules
in a cup of hot water. Fill a basin with warm
water into which the ends of the hair can
fall, and shampoo the stallax mixture into the
roots in the usual way. Then rinse and dry
by fanning with a palm fan.
Grey Hair.—To restore tlie color of grey or
fading hair, take two ounces of concentrated
tammalife, and mix it with three ounces or
bay rum; apply to the hair for several nights,
using a small sponge, and the hair will grad-
ually resume its original color. When the
desired shade has been obtained, the tamma-
lite lotion should be used about twice a week.
Apply it to the roots with an old toothbrush
ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS.
TO WHITEN A BROWN NECK (W.K,).—'To
whiten your neck, use jettaline. Get a tube
of this from the chemist and rub a little well
into the skin of the neck; leave it on till next
morning-. Do this regularly every night for
three or four weeks, and you will find that
the skin will become beautifully clear and
white.
BABY. —You need not lose your pretty com-
plexion. Get a tin of mercolized wax, and
rub a little well into the face every night.
This well remove the dead outer skin and
reveal the pretty fresh new skin underneath.
Be careful what soap you use, as this is very
Important. I should suggest Pilenta.
MATER.—To reduce yourself to your original
weight, get a packet of clynol berries and eat
four daily, one after each meal and one at
bedtime. When once yon have returned to
your normal weight you can discontinue
them, as the cure is permanent and not merely
temporary, as so many others are. There is
no need to make any alteration in your diet.
DISAPPOINTED. I am not surprised that
you have been disappointed in your hair: you
are not using a suitable shampoo. Get a
packet of stallax and shampoo the hair every
fortnight with this. It will make it soft and
keep it fair.
NELLIE.—There is nothing more disastrous
to beauty than superfluous hair. In that you
are right, but you are wrong in thinking fliyj.
there is no permanent cure. Get an ounce of
powdered pheminol and a'tnbe of tekko paste.
These two, used in conjunction, will perma-
nently remove the growth.
GERTIE.—The lotion to which you refer is
made as follows: Get an ounce of cleminite
and mix it with four ounces of warm water.
Allow it to cool, bottle, and dab oyer the facfv
allowing it to dry on the skin. This is far
superior to powder, and gives a fresh bloora
to the face without the appearance of makeup.
MAISIE.—Yes, the longer your eyelashes the
larger and brighter your eyes will look. Tt>
increase the growth of the lashes rub a little
mennaline into the roots every night. Do .this
very gently, but thoroughly, and you will be
delighted with the result.

You are a star when the sea is dark,
A far light and true;
Over deep seas will 1 sail my bark
Home to you.
l im are a flame in the front of a cloud,
"’hen the -day goes Wrong-,
With a swift flash to sear the proud
And burn the strong.
You are a, fire on a high hill
With red sparks blown—
A beacon to call a man still
To guard his own.
You are a blaze in a quiet house
When the white snows fall
And the door is shut and a little mouse
Buns round the wall.
You are a candle white and fine
In a small place apart;
And the room is full of a prayer of mine,
For the room is my heart.
N.S.W
DAVID MoKEE WHIGHT
Ghent
At vespers in the Beguinage Chapel in
Ghent—the Hulu-t dcs Beguincs —oil lamps
and candles made a faint twilight over the
bowed, white-geared heads and blue robes of
the Sisters, reduced females “of spotless
reputation,” according to the demands of
the foundation’s charter. The Beguinage is
a half-way house between the flesh and the
spirit. The vows are perfunctory, acci-
dental : the net result, is a quiet life and a
never-ending stream of religious ceremonies:
in a glorified almshouse settlement of beauti-
ful Gothic cottages.
Ghent, at present a German provincial
(own in a perpetual state of resist-
ance to everything, four years ago was tlm
old capital of Eastern Flanders, sitting cold
and white on the river Scheldt and very
busy weaving and making lace and money.
As artistic relief from this utilitarianism,
she exported camellias, azaleas, laurel trees
and palms. Old Jacques van Artevelde,
the brewer, of Ghent, is credited with
knocking the place into an economic mono-
lith in the 14th century; certainly he rose
from Brewer of Ghent to Captain of Ghent,
and made merry in the Chateau de Contes
de Flandres with Edward 111. and Philippa.
That was in the Place Ste. Pharai'lde in
1339; I didn’t see the charming square until
574 years later. In the interim they had
built a Romanesque castle and dungeons,
beautiful Gothic gables—and a fish-market
that smelt. Lime-trees had been planted
there whose leaves dreamed in yellow arid
brown. All that made up, 1 suppose, for
public executions there from the 15th to the
18th centuries, and for a room half-way lip
the turret stairs with four skeletons of
forgotten prisoners in it.
Maurice Maeterlinck had a house near
Ghent, a rambling, haunted, mediaeval bar-
rack of a place with an enormous tangled
wilderness of garden. His artistic relief
from Birds and Monna Faunas was
sparring with Georges Carpentier, the
French heavyweight champion whose recent
job was dropping bombs from his ’plane some
miles south of that garden.
Not much of the old town is left. The
Cathedral of Sint Baafs had an enormous
Van Eyck (both Jan and Hubert —half each)
of the Adoration of the Lamb: arresting
enough in its' desperate photographic
accuracy of technique, but not much else,
The Cathedral is gaunt and cold; very cor-
rect architecturally and nearly lifeless.
Otherwise, the Place Ste. Pharai’lde is about
all, so far as history’s memories go. There the
stones and warm red bricks still whisper to
the lime-trees’ shadows on the pavement.
Even the dungeons and the gibbet seem kindly
there, and quiet and content. Good busi-
ness is not always a good thing; there is
more permanency in bad business and long,
contented thought.
Wine is not so dominant in Ghent as it
ought to. be. . Old Brussels and Bruges
regard wine in its true light; new Brussels
does so in an affected Parisian manner, but
finds that it is red, nevertheless. In
the Beaux Arts, heaps of devotional
pictures call one aloft—-de Crayers, Ver-
hagens, P. Bruegliels. Plenty of fine
portraits by Th. de Keyser, J. de
Heem and Fr. Hals illustrate the sad his-
tory of good, business. But there ivere
hardly any interiors of wayside inns or
kitchens where a man’s eyes might take
passing comfort.
.The first union mentioned in European
history—the Weavers’ Union—was inaugu-
rated in Ghent: that is the best thing about
the place.-

about anything of invaluable record. Politi-

“Unalloyed” Dyes
The dyes used in Hose
of Luxite are “unalloyed” —not
loaded with heavy metallic com-
pounds to give the hose a glossy,
heavy appearance.
The soft, full-bodied shimmer of
Hose of Luxite is gained by the
use of rich, fine-stitched materials,
pure-dyed.
That is why its elegance and
beauty last through repeated wash-
ings.
The wide range of styles and
prices will suit every purse and

Don’t accept substitutes, and

Sink in the thronging dark, the firefly cars,
Lanterns of twilight, thread the moving

Till all the dust swims in a sea of stars.

ZORA CROSS.
Over the Threshold.
Wlmt Chance was lurking across the thresh-
old?
What Fate came over the step with us?
The wind was crying about the tower,
The rain was low and monotonous ;
A street lamp showed in the mirrr-'ng
puddles
A hansom, splashing with spattered wheels,
As we stumbled in at the darkened entry
Where day obscures what the night reveals.
Into the house—to find the darkness
That leapt and captured us unaware!
A thought, new born of the crouching
shadows,
Rose, pulsing life by the hidden stair.
Two steps up—and I should have left you,
Hand on the railings polished brown ;
But I turned somehow to its voiceless
message
And you looked up, dear, as I looked down.
The wide wet street had no care about us;
The wide wet street with its pools of light.
But the old house whispered of other lovers,
And the grey old house had its way that
night.
Shut doors, with never a taper’s glimmer;
A fluttering meeting of finger-tips
On your rough tweed coat.... then the
sudden flower
Of scarlet passion upon your lips!

The Lost Lyric.
I hear, in dreams, a song I fain would sing:
Awakened, in my ears its rhythms ring,
While on my lips its tones lie quivering.
Soft lullaby which soothes my slumbering.
Song of night’s stillness—song I fain would
sing!
Could I but voice it, Fame would laurels
bring.
All Shadowland would gather listening
To that sweet harping, on a golden string,
Which flies before me like a bird a-wing:
Song of sweet slumbers —song I ne’er shall
sing!

Bagpipes.
Along the line the pipes went wildly shrill-
ing,
Heedless of all the rattle of the train,
Some ancient, wild and very martial strain.
With full-puffed cheeks the piper labored
filling
His windy bag; and, with vast patience will-
ing
At each request to play and play again.
I heard an angry passenger complain—
“ For Heaven’s sake stop it; give the man a
shilling!”
I know not whence the magic of that call,
Half-loved, half-hated, that blew down the
night.
Somewhere in ages past my soul rose proud,
Drunk with its peal, to conquer or to fall.
Somewhere with shaking limbs, grown ashen
white,
In terror of its shriek I dumbly bowed.

The shafts of sunlight show,

Where great white orchids blow;
With dusky gold asheen.
’Midst stately plumes of green,
Like clouds of elfins light;
With dusky gold asheen
They dance from left to right.
With curtsey slow and sweet,
Blowing a kiss to me,
Advance and bow, retreat—
Measure of ecstasy.
Blowing a kiss to me—
Soft pipings through the grass—
Measure of ecstasy,
The elfins chain and pass.
Soft piping through the grass,
Off goes the dainty band;
The elfins chain and pass,
Dancing in Wonderland.

SOMETHING LIKE A CRISIS.
The Australian Government, a well-meaning
but rather expensive institution, breaks the
news to Australia that the trouble is really
about to begin. Hitherto the country has
been merely borrowing and loafing and doing
oratory on the fringe of the trouble. The
first part of the problem is that the shipping
difficulty has really become acute. An easy-
going community thought it was acute
before, but that was because it hadn’t taken
the trouble to view the situation. The
aggregate slump in ships is bad enough,
but the acceleration of the slump is, even
more significant. These are the figures:—
Entered and Cleared at Australian' Ports.
Tons of shipping. Decline.
1913- (peace) .. 10,732,854
1914- (war) .. 8,599,258 2,133,590
1915- (war) .. 8,538,322 60,936
1916- (war) .. 7,694,442 843,880
1917- (war) .. 5,103,570 2,590,872
The falling away was diminished for a time
by the expedient of buying a lot of ships with
borrowed money (not building ships with our
own money). But there are no more ships
to be bought now in all the world except
derelicts; and there is hardly any more
money to be borrowed, and some of the 14
loan-money ships are already lost. And
though the desperate need for ships began to
be visible at least 34 years ago the first vesfeel
of the new Government programme isn’t half
constructed yet. There was delay through
incapacity in high places. There was delay
because, through Foreign-trade and fiscal-
sinking policies and reliance on the great
natural resources of the country, there were
practically no factories to make steel plates
and other raw material for ships, and
for want of ships to bring the raw
material for ships there was difficulty
about making ships. And the work was
held up through arguments about the
day-labor superstition, which sets forth that
the best worker must be paid no more than
the worst one, and that he must have no
incentive to do more work than the laziest
one, and that the most incompetent one must
sot the pace. This might be understandable
if work was scarce and had to be carefully
conserved. But the importing statistics and
the borrowing statistics and the fact that 60
ships are wanted, and only a very few even
started, suggest that four-fifths of the avail-
able work isn't done and four-fifths of the
available wages aren’t earned. Yet, curiously
enough, in some very big industries such as
shearing and coal-miniug, the unions wouldn’t
have day labor at any price.
Because the shipping difficulty is really
starting, a few things are expected to hap-
pen. One is that the wheat industry and
some other industries may have to go over-
board as Jonah went over to the whale.
For some years the Government has bought
the wheat and paid a very low price for it,
and hasn’t been too prompt with its pay-
ments. It sold what it could of the surplus,
mostly to the British Government, and the
British Government paid in advance. What
the Australian Cabinet couldn’t sell it paid
for with borrowed money, so far as it did
pay, and put away to moulder. The amounts
it still owes to the farmers must be paid with
borrowed money. For want of the ships we
didn’t build a great deal of the wheat which
the British Government paid for was never
delivered, and now it seems that Britain isn’t
buying any more at any price, having no use
for wheat that it can’t get. It has even sug-
gested that it will gladly cancel a great part
of the sales and take back the money, which
is absurd, seeing that this country can’t give
back the money. As an alternative, Britain
suggests that this country should go to a lot
of expense in providing for the safe-keeping
of the wheat, or should take it back if it goes
bad on our hands, and eat the rotten stuff
ourselves, and give good wheat in its place.
This annoyance, and a thousand other exas-
perations, might be got over by building ships
at express speed (in the U.S. a big ship was
recently built in 35 days), but that would be
“speeding up.”
*• * « »
The wheat difficulty is only one among
many. There is a stoppage of the arrival of
imported railway and telegraph and tele-
phone material, so that trains and other
things are growing scarcer; a possibility of
the stoppage of the Melbourne tramcars for
lack of imported cables; a chance that lifts
may stop for lack of imported ropes ; a possi-
bility of the electric-light blowing out for the
usual reason ; an increasing difficulty about
getting away wool, coal, meat and metals
and turning them into money—in fact, if the
present financial year, of which a disastrous
quarter has already expired, finishes as last
one did in the shipping business, the stop-
page or. partial stoppage of almost every-
thing will, under present conditions, be in
sight. For the first of our own ships will
hardly be in the water then, and at the pre-
sent pace it is likely to be five years before
enough are afloat to make much difference in
the situation. It is even announced that, for
want of ships to bring imported goods, paper
has been put under Government, control and
is to be shared out like water to sailors on a
raft. Certainly a multitude of these pro-
blems could be settled by an heroic increase in
manufactures. Canada and the United
States, with their high tariffs (which we
lack) and their intense pride in their coun-
try’s advancement (which we also lack, for
we go in more for internationalism than
nationalism), have increased their manufac-
tures, including ship manufacture, 200 or 300
or more per cent, during the war years.
Australia shows an increase of about 12 per
cent., and that is in prices, not in quantity.
The number of employees is less, just as is
the case with agricultural industries. And
while wages have gone up very largely the
manufacturer’s profit has gone down. There
are several reasons for this. The insane
Foreign-traders’ tariff i s a warning to the
manufacturer that if he starts a new indus-
try because of war conditions he will be
ruined by the imported products of foreign
cheap labor as soon as the war is over. Then
if he makes a loss on a new industry the loss
is his own, while if he makes a profit the
Government takes 50 per . cent, of it in the
first year and 75 per cent, afterwards. Then
he is confronted with the living wage. In a
country which imports almost everything,
barring some simple raw products at the
foreign-profiteer’s prices and imports it at
any rate the foreign shipowning profiteer likes
to demand, the living wage is an anomaly. It
means that the man who produces a few
plain varieties of goods to be sold at much
the old pre-war rate, barring export
articles which it is difficult to sell at all,
must be paid on a scale which will put
within his reach a multitude of foreign
articles the price of which has increased any-
where from 100 to 1000 per cent. The posi-
tion would be difficult for all parties even if
the awards of Arbitration Courts carried
any weight.
* * * *
Divers facts suggest that some sort of
crisis is approaching unless this country does
a good deal more useful work. Two States
are already in receipt of “relief” ; and the
one that is farthest from the place where the
war-loans are mostly spent and is conse-
quently rather out of. the boom, intimates
that more “relief” must come from some-
where, else things will happen. Australia
has paid less of its war expenses out of
revenue than any other country, and has
borrowed the rest, largely in England, for
Australian loans are almost entirely paper
money, which doesn’t circulate outside the
country. English Federal loans are growing
scarcer and dearer. State loans in England
have ceased, and in Australia they also are
paper, of no value in the purchase of im-
ported materials for railway building and
the like. About £40,000,000 has been bor-
rowed, or is to be borrowed, to keep alive
by buying up and storing the products till
ships are found, industries which would
otherwise have struck a calamitous slump.
It has apparently been decided that the pro-
cess has its limits. The device of making
money by the issue of paper has about
reached its finish. In the war-years about
£40,000,000 have been added to the note
issue; but of that increase some £25.000,000
is held by the banks in £lOOO notes, because
the public has no use for them, and has
nothing particular to give in exchange for
them. The expedient of lending money to
the thriftless State Governments out of the
gold reserve, held against Federal notes, was
apparently exhausted long ago. It wasdone
to a large extent when the reserve was
absurdly super-abundant. Now the reserve
is merely abundant and that pawnshop has
presumably closed. If the latest export and
import figures are any criterion, imports
(which calls for a final settlement in gold—
a very scarce article —and prevent local
industry) are now greatly in excess of
exports (which bring in gold and are the
product of local industry). The demand for
gold to pay interest on foreign debts is
immensely larger than it even was before,
and the supply of gold from the mines is
less than it has been for 27 years. If this
country made a great deal more goods, in-
cluding ships, so that it could buy less
abroad and sell more abroad, it would have
more gold to meet its foreign’ liabilities with.
Also it would earn more wages, and it
would have a vast number of things at a
quarter the present prices through eliminat-
ing the foreign profiteer and the shipowner
and the middleman. There have been sug-
gestions about a six-hour day; about repu-
diating the public debt and confiscating the
banks, either of which would probably lead
to a suspension of the Constitution at the
demand of a swarm of outside creditors,
shareholders and depositors; and about
blank revolution, which would bring along
an army of occupation. There have been all
these things, but the suggestion of a lot more
plain work under a tariff which would make
work possible hasn’t eventuated.
A GROWING PILE OF BOARDS.
Not long ago Australia was plentifully
decorated with political platforms. Now
the nation seems in danger of being covered
by Boards. At any rate Boards are spring-
ing up, if a Board can be said to spring, like
dandelions in summer-time. Nearly every
morning the newspapers announce that a
new Board has been appointed to do some-
thing incidental to the work for which poli-
ticians and public servants happen to be
paid. If on any given morning the an-
nouncement, is not about a Board of this
sort, the news is in relation to a
Board for sprinkling whitewash over
someone, or preventing someone else mak-
ing a more calamitous mess of his job than
he is suspected of perpetrating. There must
be about 735 Boards in Australia just now,
handling matters that range from the price
of meat to the importation of tinned fish.
Some of them could get a testimonial of
imbecility for the mere asking. Others do
their work with reasonable competency. Of
the remainder some are plain superfluity and
some are grinding axes with great industry.
It is something in the nature of more than
a jest. The two latest Boards manu-
factured by the Federal Government
are (1) a Board to consider and appoint
generally upon. Commonwealth expenditure
and (2) a Board to consider the future de-
velopment of agriculture and the problems of
production.
* * * •*
If is an unhappy reflection that the first
of these Boards is as badly needed by Aus-
tralia as medicine by a sick man—that with-
out some such outfit the’ community runs
the risk of being ruined by tlie profligates to
whom the public assets are constitutionally
entrusted. Both the appointment of this
Board and the unquestionable fact that there
is work of an unpleasant kind for it to do is
the worst sort of reflection on Parliament.
Also the appointment and fact are reminders
of the _ outrageous slackness of the Legis-
lature in the “control” of revenue and
expenditure. Parliamentary control of the
cash-box has degenerated. There is no
such thing as intelligent criticism of
expenditure nor even an authorisation of
expenditure which can escape description as
a reflection on Australia’s political intelli-
gence. The procedure incidental to getting
rid of the public’s money is a mockery of
reason, and a direct encouragement to prodi-
gal sons to do their worst. Copious sup-
plies are granted Ministries—expenditure is
voted in blocks —and then, long after the
money has disappeared and the Government
is up to its neck in commitments, the pro-
ceedings come up for review in ugly detail.
At that stage there is nothing left for party
hacks to do but say “Yes” to everything that
transpires.
* * *
It is quite conceivable that in a wiser
age every member of Parliament will
be attached to a Board, and no Min-
ister will be permitted to touch 2d.
without the authority of a Board, counter-
signed by 27 other Boards. But whatever
the future may have in store there is no
getting away from this —that left to itself
with a few millions in hand and a pawnshop
in sight. Parliament is as reliable a trustee
as a Fiji uncle. About the Federal Gov-
ernment’s Agricultural Board, this paper
awaits information permitting judgment on
whether the outfit has a rational place in
the scheme of things, or is only a manifesta-
tion of a frantic desire to pile one Board
on top of another. The States have
had Agricultural Boards or the equivalent
thereto for a generation or more. They
have large supplies of experts on tap and
piles of documents from experts and others
about agriculture. Possibly Watt has an
idea that the time is ripe to have more
Departments of Agriculture and more ex-
perts on the pay-roll. If he has, the agita-
tion for a Board to fall on other Boards
ought to start at once. As this paper sees it
what is urgently needed is a Board to abol-
ish Boards.
MATES AND THEIR DIFFERENT
SWAGS.
The French Mission now visiting Australia
is getting a column or two in adjacent news-
papers every day, loud applause whenever it
appears in public, hospitable entertainment
and frequent opportunities to listen to the
local orator’s experiments in the art of grace-
ful speech. It may be hoped that the travel-
lers are deriving as much pleasure from their
tour as every Australian is from helping to
make the visit agreeable. There exists be-
tween these men of France and the citizens
of the Commonwealth a bond of the kind that
is strongest in human relationships. The
sons of Australia and of France have fought
and died together in a common cause—and,
whatever may be the gratitude of French-
men to Australia for help in battle, it is cer-
tain that this can never exceed the sense of
indebtedness to France which all Australians
will carry through life. France saved Aus-
tralia far more definitely than she saved
herself —and did it at a terrible cost. Won-
derful though the valor of her armies has
been all through the terrible four years’ trial,
Australians see in France something more
to admire than military achievement, and
that is the supreme heights of moral courage
to which she rose in the struggle for her free-
dom and the freedom of all mankind from
organised brutality. It is impossible to meas-
ure in conventional terms the debt of Aus-
tralia to France. It is a debt that can never
be repaid—or repaid only by a devotion in
the years to come to the cause of right and
freedom as unwavering as that of the older
country ; by the democracy hereabouts show-
ing the same faith in its tradition and its
future as that of the democracy built by
Frenchmen on the ruins of their old regime.
So far. then, as this Mission is representa-
tive of a country and people for whom Aus-
tralians have a peculiar affection and with
whom they have politically and socially
much in common, it is very welcome. In
doing honor to the Missioners Australians do
honor to themselves. All modern democracies
have been the heirs of France, in many ways.
When the war wilh militarist autocracies is
over they will owe her nearly everything. The
recovery of France from her fearful treat-
ment will be watched by all the world out-
side Germany with something more than sym-
pathy. But words and cheers are not going
to be much use to a country from which
half the male population of from 20 to 25
has been swept by war, whose industries
have been paralysed and whose technical
equipment has been crippled. Such a country
wants help and encouragement of the practi-
cal kind. It is up to Australia to realise this.
* * * *
The Bulletin does not suppose that
any serious opposition need be looked
for to any national method of secur-
ing from the Commonwealth such measure
of assistance for France as is within its
powers to offer. Nor is there reason to sus-
pect that the matter would be considered in
any haggling spirit. But as the position of
the world generally at the end of the war b
as yet merely speculative, it may be just as
well for our French visitors to look into the
future through Australian eyes for a time —
looking at our problems in conjunction with
their own. They will notice a great
contrast. In France they see a small country
populated by many millions of people, well-
equipped in the industrial sense, requiring
only a certain amount of reconstruction and
rehabilitation to begin the business incidental
to peace at the point of interruption. In
Australia they will see a big country—
larger in area than France, Germany, Aus-
tria, Hungary, Spain and Italy all lumped
together—populated by a community fewer
in number than inhabit Paris —a country in
the making, so to speak.
* * * *
For a long time France was one of the
largest buyers of Australian wool and skins.
One of the greatest French industries is the
spinning of tops and the manufacture of
textiles. The French manufacturer takes
the jumbuck’s suit, works it up into market-
able commodities and sends these round the
world. It pays him well. The industry
maintains many thousands of French arti-
sans. Now, that wool business is one in
which Australia has more than an academic
interest. The gain to France is the loss to
Australia. When Australia exports greasy
wool work for Australian citizens is ex-
ported. When workers in other countries
weave cloth from Australian ivool they are
doing work which could and should be done
on the premises where the animal was shorn.
And it is the same story about metals and
hides and rabbit-skins. The future of Aus-
tralia turns almost uiiolly upon the use the
materials iu the Commonwealth are put to —
upon which the mania for exporting raw
materials so that population can be kept
away yields to reason. France, in common
with other countries, has shown a fairly
accurate knowledge of how to make the most
ot what she has on hand, and it does no
harm to remind the visitors that unless Aus-
tralia goes on the same lines the industrial
upbuilding of the Commonwealth cannot pro-
gress. .The w T ar has put heavy burdens on
Australia- —heavier, far. than most people
think. If we can help France, by all means
let us. But Australia must also buckle to
its ow-n job.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Another Load.
j\". S. Wales Labor-Minister Beeby was able
to announce last week that he intended to take
a six months’ trip to America—at the public
expense. Later on Premier Holman ex-
plained that Beeby “had been requested by
the Government to inquire into industrial
questions, particularly workmen’s welfare
and profit-sharing co-operation.” No one
believes that the jaunt has been author-
ised. because of a yearning for infor-
mation about welfare work and profit-shar-
ing—or that even if the yearning existed
there is necessity to detach a Minister from
his job and send him away on a half-year
jaunt after the details. There is a whole
mountain of literature available to anyone
who wants to get a grip of the proceedings
incidental to “welfare work” and several
mountains on hand about the principles and
practice of profit-sharing. Neither Beeby
nor anyone else will be any more wise on
either subject because of the trip provided
him by the taxpayers than if he had stayed
at home and cultivated radishes. Anyway,
the passion among politicians and public ser-
vants to rush away on trips and “make in-
quiries” about bacon-curing or street-water-
ing or something has developed into a fair-
sized scandal. Heaven knows what the
annual cost is to Australia of this mania for
free meals and transportation to foreign
countries, but it must absorb quite a lot of
money for which better use could be found.
N. S. Wales spent thousands of pounds
on fool inquiries about “dry farming"
in Yankeeland. Then more thousands were
spent in maintaining Nielsen as a Trade
Commissioner in the same locality, and the
squandering went on until the thing smelt so
high that the entire business had to be
knocked . on the head. Tf The Bulletin
was addicted to the gambling habit it would


be prepared to offer long odds that the return
to the public from the investment of a large
sum in Beeby’s researches into tlie inwards
of welfare work and profit-sharin g will be
exactly Od.
Jokook’s Navee.
From the report of the Royal Commission
on Navy Administration, handed last week
to the Federal Parliament: —
It is incomprehensible that a Department spending
£7,000,000 a year should endeavor to conduct the
affairs without the services of an expert to scrutinise
all financial proposals and to ensure that due regard
is paid to economy.
The simple answer to this is that such pro-
ceedings are not incomprehensible. They are
part and parcel of the system common to
Australia. To hear that any branch of the
public service identified with getting rid of
loan and other money exhibited even a mild
interest in the manner adopted to pass out
the cash would be a piece of news so stag-
gering in its novelty as to be unbelievable.
To a public familiar with the broad facts
connected with the Defence Department, the
performances at Canberra, the Northern
Territory interlude and the construction of
railways uid naval works and the manage-
ment of the Post Office by the Federal Gov-
ernment, it must surely be astounding to find
a Royal Commission so lost to sense of pro-
priety—so amazingly deficient in humor—as to
admit being able to comprehend a public
department spending £7,000,000 a year with-
out adopting reasonable precautions at the
pay-out window. The evidence on which
the Royal Commission framed the report
lately published is not yet available ; but as
the Commission was unable to find anyone
in the vicinity of the £7,000,000 and
announces that Ministers had been in the
habit of ignoring advice, and in defiance of
advice incurring expenditure ivith unsatis-
factory results to the Commonwealth, The
Bulletin suspects that the same old famil-
iar mess is available at another place. Mean-
while the Government has decided to put a
finance member on the Naval Board, and
take other precautions on paper regarding
the annual escape of funds. The only pos-
sible consolation for the taxpayers seems to
rest in the reflection that muddling poli-
ticians, incompetent civil servants, squab
filing Boards and humorless Royal Commis-
sions are doing their best to blow everything
up in the air. It is a weird circumstance
that every one of the administrative Bol-
sheviks who have been playing ducks and
drakes with the Australian citizens’ cash
during recent years always has a mouthful
of hot air about “Efficiency” to blow off at
people who do their more humble jobs with
a steadiness and competence those muddlers
know nothing about.
The Glorification of Hughes, P.C.
Prime Minister Hughes, or somebody on
his behalf —possibly his limelight man or his
scene-shifter —seems to be pulling the white
man’s leg in a shameful fashion. Also some-
body has been burning blue fire and Roman
candles and other illuminations regardless of
cost. The fact that Hughes hired a chateau
in France to contain, at Australia’s expense,
eminent persons whom he invites to view our
poorly-reinforced troops is a mere detail.
William would hire the Pyramids and Kar-
nak and Baalbec and the Coliseum if the
thought struck him. Australia is used to his
large ideas and large bills. But the way lie
pastes his advt. on the chest of his country
is too much. A U.S. paper, Popular
Mechanics, has learned that under
Hughes’s Prime Ministership “all Aus-
tralia has been stirred by the war,” and it
enthused wildlv about a boom in textiles and
shipbuilding and in the export and marketing
of wool, butter, meat, cheese, etc. Hughes
himself told at an Empire Producers’
dinner that his great trade organisation work
whs in full blast, and bloom. “Manufacturers
and producers in each industry get together
and elect representatives to a council which
acts as an executive for the industry.... The
council is the guardian of the industry....
The industry finds out its weak parts and
applies the appropriate remedy.'’ In fact the
wordy little person drew a picture of the in-
dustry of a continent regulated, disciplined,
organised, fostered and rushed at high
pressure by a new Napoleon himself.
And on the strength of this his press-
agent and scene-shifter have persuaded
a section of the British public that
he is an almost indispensable statesman, and
that a place ought to be found for him in the
Mother of Parliaments. To get down from
the lofty tight-rope of fancy : The first ship
of the 'great shipbuilding programme isn’t
finished yet, and that solitary vessel isn’t
expected for many weeks or some months.
The wheat-farmer whose crop the Hughes
Government took over at a low price, not
even allowing him to retain seed, has had
part of the low price owing to him for three
years. He is informed that he had better
ease off on wheat-growing lest he should get
no price at all, as the best part of two years
crops remains on hand and the new crop
seems likely to do the same. Copper pro-
ducers have been warned that, owing to the
same imbecile lack of ships which afflicts the
wheat man, their output will pfobably be left
on their hands after the end of this year.
Somewhat similar remarks are made to pro-
ducers of zinc, lead, etc. Coal export has
almost ceased for lack of ships. The paper
manufacture hasn’t started in any serious
fashion, and newspapers are to be reduced in
size for lack of ships to bring paper. Since
the last' year of peace the number of factories
in Australia has diminished by several hun-
dreds, while Canada, which has a solid Pro-
tectionist tariff and consequently knoAvs how
to make its own ships, has built 700 new fac-
tories for the making of munitions of Avar
alone, and has 750,000 workers employed in
them —more than twice as many as Aus-
tralia has in all its factories put together.
The records of the value of the production
in all Australian industries are only pub-
lished up to the end of 1016, they being
elaborate concerns which require a great deal
of making up. This is the record for 1916:
Extra income by increase in value
of pastoral production .. .. .£24,333,000
Less decrease in other industries,
especially agriculture .. . . 5,495,000
Total increase in value of production
for third war year .. .. .. £18,838,000
Money raised by additions to State
debts (not war debts) .. .. 14,888,000
Money raised by expansion of Federal
note issue . . . . . . . . 3,259,000
£36,985,000
Out of the new income Avhieh came to hand
in 1916 nearly half was loan money of one
kind and another (this is saying nothing of
war loans, which were bigger than all the
other items put together) ; and but for the
temporary boom in the rather primitive
cattle and sheep business there Avould have
been no increase at all except out of loans—
in fact there Avould have been a ghastly
slump. The war brought the chance of a
thousand years to the big A\diite-man coun-
tries which were outside the Avar-zone, and
they all seized Opportunity by the forelock
save the debt-ridden, importer-ridden, fiscal-
HUGHES-i'idden land of Australia.
~
The Depreciated Depreciation Funds.
The balance-sheet of the CommonAvealth’s
mercantile fleet, bought in England out of
loan money (not built here out of revenue
to employ Australian workers) has been laid
before Parliament. It is a fairly good bal-
ance-sheet, if the feet of clay aren’t inspected,
so to speak, shoAving a profit of about 15
per cent, on the cost of the vessels. This is
a lavish amount compared with the returns
from most loan money investments, but
nothing gorgeous considering the profits run-
ning up to 700 per cent., which some over-
sea lines are making in these Avar times. But
there is the usual fly in the amber, or the usual
fake in the ointment, or whatever it may be
called. In the first place the alleged earnings
for this first year include those of voyages
which Avere not completed when the year
ended —that is to say they include some earn-
ings which Averen’t earned. If only one
day of a 42-days’ voyage has been completed
AA;hen the accounts close it is a dubious
kind of arithmetic which takes into the
accounts the other 41 days’ profits. “Un-
completed voyages” are as regular a deduc-
tion from the earnings of a private shipping
co. as “rebate on bills current” from those
of a bank or allowance for unexpired policies
Avith an insurance office. The auditors
mention casually that no allowance is made
for depreciation. This is an appalling item
in the shipping line, for a ship is faced
by conditions Avhieh don’t affect a land
structure. And while the wear and tear of
a bank office in a city street may be more
than set off by the increase in the value of
AA'hat it stands on, there is no unearned
increment in what a ship stands on. The
sea isn’t freehold. The ship perishes
fast through becoming obsolete. A bank
housed in a hopelessly out-of-date structure,
the speed of which is ten knots below the
average, may earn more than its rival in a
palace Avith electric-heating apparatus. But
the ship that has fallen far behind the times
loses passengers, loses perishable freight, and
is partly out of the race, because its anti-
quated appliances eat up more coal than
those of its rivals. It is quite common for
half the nominal profits of a shipping con-
cern to be set aside for this kind of old-age
insurance. The methods complained of are
characteristic of Australia’s loan-money
deA’ices, which aim at “saving face” rather
than at honesty. Depreciation funds are
very rare in the loan business. As a rule
every mile of new railway and every bridge
is reckoned as neAV till it is so old that it
is dead and has to be replaced. The land
on Avhieh it stands may increase in value,
but that doesn’t help the case, for the rail-
way can’t be removed to a cheaper site and
the land sold. And it is the same with
other things. Certainly all the States pro-
fess to have sinking funds against their
loans, and there are depreciation funds of a
humorous sort —the least humorous being
that of Westralia. Here are the latest com-
plete figures (1917)
Depreciation Fu_vds against Loans.
N. S. Males id. in the£ | S.A. 9Jd. in the £
Queensland lid. in the £ Tasmania 1/Ofd. in the £
Victoria 61d. in the £ | W.A. 2/s|d. in the £
These are not allowances for a single year,
but the accumulation of years. That of N.
S. Wales dates back to George Reid’s time,
and it is diminishing. Payments to it
have ceased to all intents and purposes
under the Holman regime. Queensland only
started its fund in 1912, and has paid in
honestly, in a small fashion, so far. But-
all except the Westralian fund are liable
to be seized at any moment by hungry
Treasurers, or the money is simply invested
in new loans so that when the old loan falls
due the fund has only a bit of paper in the
new loan to redeem it with. The Westralian
fund is fixed by constitutional agreement,
and the money is paid to trustees in London.
The bargain can’t be broken save by consent
of the British Government, and that consent
is now r being asked for, the State being tired
of partial honesty, and sorry the thing was
ever invented. This country is an absolute
whale in the way of providing for depreci-
ation.

Things that Money Can’t Buy.
We have long been accustomed to assume
that anything can be bought abroad provided
we have the money—loan money, land-sale
money, money dug out. of the earth while the
irreplaceable and fast-diminishing gold supply
holds out, our own money, other people’s
money, paper money or bogus money. There-
fore self-reliance was only a voluntary
alternative or a fad or a matter of opinion.
The idea that there may soon be certain very
essential things which can’t be bought abroad
for all the money in creation is new'. As a
case in point, the United States, which pro-
duces two-thirds of the wnrld’s oil supply,
proposes to shut down the export after the
war for ever and a day. The stuff can’t be
replaced. It isn’t an annual crop like hay
or wool. The demand, owing to motor-cars,
air-vessels, oil-burning ships and a multitude
of other things, has increased enormously. In
fact, to a great extent oil is now civilisation.
Uncle Sam reckons that there are about 30
years known supply left in his territory and
that he will want, it all for his own civilisa-
tion. The next biggest, supplier—but a. very
long w r ay behind—is Russia, and if it, does
the same sort, of thing there is very little left
for the outside world except Mexico. It will
probably be found that, for oil purposes Uncle
SAM owns Mexico. The Dutch Indies and
Roumania are fourth and fifth on the list of
oil-well owners. The British Empire, one of
the greatest consumers, is a. poor sixth.
Britain takes the matter so seriously that it
is proposed to bore the British Isles for possi-
ble supplies of petroleum and make them a
Government monopoly. Recognising that
timber, though not irreplaceable, is a slow-
growing thing and is being used up faster
than it is being produced, most countries
with trees still to spare intend to put the
business under strict regulation. There will
be very little exporting of coal and possibly
of iron and copper, but especially of coal, in
future by countries with ambitions for an
industrial future. Once finished, these things
are finished for ever, and the staggering
demands of the war years have reminded the
nations that the one with the last pound of
coal and the last pint of oil may be the last
survivor of the old kind of civilisation. (The
three nations expect to be played out much
earlier.) After that, the future may lie with
the nations that have most water-power. Aus-
tralia might consider the situation, and
especially it might consider w'hether the ex-
port of coal is all that it is cracked up to be.
The Commonwealth isn’t suspected of being
very rich in coal; in fact, away from the
mainland east coast it is suspected of being
very poor, especially in comparison with the
population it will have some day to support.
There is an idea of great inland deposits, but
underneath the artesian waters, where no one
is likely to get at them until the ocean is
pumped out. The country is not well tim-
bered ; it is about the poorest place of its
size for water-power; and its more or less
reliable oil deposits are supposed to be chiefly
in Papua. Therefore it seems as if the
coal question calls for more consideration
than in many places. In more ways than
one Australia may find itself within the next
few years short of articles that it has hitherto
regarded as a mere question of money, unless
it gets a very strenuous fit of self-reliance.
There are going to be things that money
can’t buy.
«
Wanted in Haste, a New Army.
It is well for Australians to remember that
there is still plenty of time to fight. When-
ever the Allies win a fair-sized victory many
lager-laden breaths blow into the public ear
a, suggestion that it is no longer worth while
to volunteer—that the war will be over
before the new men can get to the trenches,
and the glory will be departed, and the fame
used up, and the beer finished, and all the
honors distributed. It isn’t even a plausible
lie. The Hun may be in hard luck; but it
may not always be so hard. He still holds Bel-
gium and Servia, a bit of France and Italy
and the most valuable part of Russia. There
are many miles to go before our soldiers are
across the Rhine, and then another 400 iniies
must be covered before they are as near to
Berlin as the Huns are now to Paris. It.
is a long distance when the retreating enemy
has destroyed the railways behind him, and
stripped the land of supplies, and the artil-
lery is heavy, and the roads are worn out.
and every mile means that the invaders’
supplies must be dragged a mile further. Yet
as the French refused to give up hope even
when the Hun shells were dropping into their
capital, there is no assurance that the Hun
will give up till Berlin itself is taken. There
are four months of winter ahead, when in a
beggared and desolated land much progress is
impossible. No one dreams that the war
will finish within seven or eight weeks, and
the. enemy will have 16 weeks or more in
which to recuperate. The Hun legions are
still enormously strong, but if they could be
got on the run (which is quite possible) and
kenf. on the ri{n (which is quite impossible)
the business might be cut short and -a dis-
ordered mob of millions be scattered to all
the points of the compass. It hardly
matters how big an army is. provided it is
running anda hostile army is running hard
behind it. Unfortunately, even if matters go
as well as they have been doing, winter will
slow down the race. Men may get about, but
cannon bogged in snowdrifts aren’t Mel-
bourne Cup winners. The recruits that Aus-
tralia provides now should be just in time
for the Spring season by the Sambre and
Meuse and Scheldt and Rhine, when in face
of a rested and revived enemy every man
may be worth more than 10 would be a year
later. There may be a battle of the giants—
the real Armageddon—when the new leaves
begin to be green about Brussels and
Mayence—a battle by land and sea, for the
Kaiser’s navy is scarcely damaged yet. For
when the Hun fights on his ovyn territory he
will have something to fight for that even the
Frenchman and the Italian and the Belgian
had not —his gigantic pride, his dream, or
rather his assured conviction, of world domi-
nance; his profound belief that his is the
Chosen Race, the high-superior folk, the only
possible possessors of “Kultur,” the sons of
Gott, and the sole embodiment of real civili-
sation. Every Prussian except the aged has
been born to and trained to this faith. It is
not a case of bringing to reason one inflated
tyrant, but a nation of them —a nation of
bogus gods. Yet the war can’t be brought to
an ending which will prevent the same world
horror being repeated a few years hence, and
perhaps with better luck for the Hun, unless
the Ilun is taught that he is just a human
being and bound to keep faith and honor like
one. It will take a lot of humiliation to bring
down the Hun god to the human level. Anti
it is a long, long way to Berlin. Which is
the reason why many Australian soldiers:
need to be ready when the new leaves are
green on the one tree that is left in Belgium.
More Light on the Housing Problem.
The Upper House of Ma State devoted
its gigantic and uncorroborated intellect last
week to the (mostly Sydney) house-famine
problem, and one bright member suggested
that each of the 5356 factory proprietors in
the State (figures for 1917) should be com-
pelled to erect one domicile. Many of them
have done so already; and 2351 of them
(very small men) are scattered over the
country, some in places where a domicile
isn’t wanted; and 976 factories (578 of
them in the country) average 21 employees
each; and a capitalist with 21 employees can
hardly afford to build a domicile. Still it
was the sort of fool thing a M.L.C. would
naturally say. Why manufacturers should
be compelled to build houses more than
importers, bishops and members of Parlia-
ment doesn't appear, but the manufacturer,
being an Australian, who pays good union
wages, is supposed to be anybody’s dog. The
Sydney housing problem should be regarded
seriously, and the first essential is to get the
proposition right. Here it is:—
(1) Build a hilly city of most amazing shape.
Cut it in two by a waterway with no bridge nor
tunnel, and cut the northern half in two by another
waterway without bridge or tunnel. The whole
affair to be indented by scores of deep inlets almost
all of them without bridges and all minus tunnels.
(2) Put in it so many people that it is about the
seventh city in the world’s biggest empire.
(3) Make it almost the only big white-man’s city
in the world which has no surface railway running
through it. Give it no overhead railways arid nc
underground railways. (In London there are places
where there are three or four underground railways,
one beneath the other.) Deprive most of the suburbs
of railways, and put the central station a good dis-
tance from the business centre.
(4) Crowd all traffic into the streets and makf
them crooked and narrow.
(5) Make it a shipping rather than a manufactur
ing city. Factory population can spread all over the
suburbs, but a shipping population must be near the
water-front. Make the water-front narrow by dis-
qualifying the northern half of it through lack oi
bridges.
(6) Make house-building expensive by causing ii
to depend largely on imported materials. Create p
paper boom to make the price of land prohibitive.
Limit rents strictly. Also establish a public opiniot
that to be a man who collects rents from tin
“worker” is to be a sort of cormorant, oppressor anc
public enemy. In fact, so fix things that no deeeni
man likes to collect his rents personally.
(7) Lay it down that it is an outrage if Greatei
Sydney is even one-sixth as densely peopled a:
Greater London. That the people must not live or.
top of each other in tenement houses or such-like
devices. That they ought to have gardens. That
though every possible means is being used to crowd
folk into Sydney everybody should be able to get to
his work in reasonable time and not spend two
hours per day going and coming, even though there
may be no trains to take him to his work. Also
that he must get there cheaply even though tram-
ways are built and equipped with material brought
from the other end of the world, and the wages of
the employees can’t be cut down to the starvation
level of some other countries. Also, make the tram-
ways pay.
(8) Then put up a politician to urge that the man
who runs a microscopic woodware or harness-making
industry in the perishing town of Bourke should be
compelled to build a house.
There are other points, but these are the
principal ones.
YV estrally has decided to borrow its way
out of its difficulties for a year at least.
Ihe basis of Westralia’s trouble is
that it borrowed hard to avoid pay-
ing land tax. income tax, property tax
or probate . duty, or to dodge putting
a stamp on ,its cheque-form ox* l'eceipt. It
paid lOd. per inhabitant per annum in taxes
when Victoria was paying Bs. Id., and Tas-
mania 12s. od. Before that it paid nothing
per annum. When the complete figures were
last published, at a time when it was show-
ing record deficits, Westralia was cliai-giim
its people 255. Bd. while the other States
ranged from 295. 3d. to 425. 9d. The deficits
still booming along, and Parliament having
thrown three new Taxation Bills down the
stair so that they broke their necks, it has
been decided to indirectly suspend the public
debt sinking fund. It can’t be directly sus-
pended without British official consent, for
b i *!? efl constitutional bargain with the
British Government, and the money has to
be paid to trustees in London. (This' arrange-
ment put. a gilt edge on the securities and
enabled the State to borrow until 1913 at
lower interest than any of its neighbors,
since when Victoria has taken first place.)
It has now been arranged to borrow the
sin k in g- f Hnd contributions
(±odu,(Joo) from a London bank at 5 per
cent., the money to be repaid out of a regu-
lar loan as soon as the London money mar-
Belgium.

Four years ago the thunders as of doom
Broke on the little land that thought no
wrong.
Cold horror, rising from its ancient tomb,
Cried in the darkness, “Glory to the strong”—
Glory, red-written in the children’s blood,
Was theirs who heard not pity’s pleading
voice.
Their triumph rolled as a destroying flood ;
Death was their friend and Hate their bitter
choice.
i
What hand should stay them? Wheel to
turning wheel
Spoke loud their purpose through the waiting
years.
For this great day their hands had worked
in steel
To drench a conquered world in widow-tears.
They had their triumph. Bloodily and well
They wrought the deed appointed in their
time,
To make of earth a German-patterned hell,
And fill a million homes with nameless crime.
Four years ago! And now the tide sways
back.
Loathed and despised, the conquerors turn to
run.
A million valiant foes are on their track;
'Phe voice of Freedom thunders in the gun
That scourges them from ruined field to field.
No longer is their vaunting strong and proud !
Their highest hope is some safe chance to
yield—•
Kneeling for safety— God’s will, crushed and
cowed.
The world has seen. The world will not.
forget.
Through all the years it shall be written
plain:
“Woe to the land that dreams by force to set
Its triumphs on a people’s bitter pain.”
Belgium above the ruin soon shall rise
From her low bed of pain and misery,
A greater thing in all the future’s eyes
Than the dead brute that once was Germany.

ket re-opens. Having thus got into the habit
it is probable that the State will do as
Maoriland has done for a long time—pay its
sinking fund honestly ont of revenue, and
dishonestly put a similar amount of loan
money into revenue. It is the same old jag
with a little extra hypocrisy. Westralia
and Maoriland drink with a blue ribbon on
their coats. The other places drink in plain
clothes.
What Has to Be Done.
'The war news was rather confused last
week—at any rate such parts of it as related
to the Western Front. The broad features
of the proceedings seem to be that the Ger-
man resistance had stiffened before Cambrai
and behind St. Quentin in order to permit of
another German retreat, most likely to the
Meuse and involving part of Flanders and
a considerable section of the country east of
La Bassde and Lille. In his movements
“backwards the enemy appears to be prac-
tising frightfulness in the old, familiar style,
deporting civilians, destroying towns and
devastating the countryside. He started like
a Hun and it looks as if he is going to end
like a Hun—squealing at the thought of
getting some of his own medicine. The gang
who engineered this bloody foraging expedi-
tion are now shivering with fright for two
reasons. One is that the Allies will smash the
instrument by which Kaiserdom has tor-
tured the world during four ghastly years;
the other that the German people will turn
and rend the institutions which launched this
avalanche of horror upon them. Either the
Allies are fighting now to rid Europe of the
nightmare of Prussianism, or they are fight-
ing for nothing. A peace that would leave
this monstrous danger where it was before —
a peace that would see the world turning
from battle to continue building up fleets
and armies as before, waiting in miserable
uncertainty for the next carnival of gore—
would be a mockery of Freedom. The people
who have fought to resist destruction of their
liberties under a Prussian blucher and have
been brought to the brink of ruin by the
struggle, deserve something better than a
peace that would mean only an interlude of
exasperation. This thing called German
militarism must be broken. The breaking of
it either from within or without is something
•in the nature of a holy task. If the Germans
will not do. it themselves then the Allies
must—and if the sense of right still sur-
vives in modern democracy they will. A
peace on the basis of the German withdraw-
ing from the scrap and offering a charitable
dole .to Belgium would leave Germany
a winner. Everything for which Ger-
many stood at the beginning would be
triumphant not only in the Fatherland but
elsewhere. The Prussian monarchy is a
criminal thing. Its members should be
treated as criminal outlaws are treated every-
where, so that the decent people of this earth
may know what peace really means.
The Boom in Returned Soldiers, etc.
“Wild Cat” writes :
The fact that no less than £10,000,000 of locally-
raised loan money is to be spent this year in buying
land for returned soldiers brings a ray of gladness
into many a dingy house and land office, and makes
the stoek-and-station agent feel a new man. So
far it is estimated that over £100,000,000 of war
loan money has been expended in Australia (paper
money can’t be expended an.ywhere else), which
means that £100,000,000 of new paper (bonds) has
been added to the nominal wealth of the com-
munity without diminishing its supply of the pre-
vious paper (notes). The business was spread over
three years, but it has only been going really
strong of late. With the new loan and the pre-
vious one there will probably be £60,000,000 added
to the community’s theoretical wealth this year.
Which is equal to a theoretical dividend of about
£l2 per inhabitant, or £1 3s. Id. per week for a
family of five.
A loan war fought at a distance is a highly pay-
able business in its early stages, before the enthusi-
asm has cooled down and the bonds have become
too numerous, and while the War Loan interest bill
is still in its infancy. The last item is the fly
in the .ointment; for the paying of interest on
the loan doesn’t add to the currency as subscribing
to the loan does; the payer gets a useless receipt
for his money instead of a saleable bit of paper
earning 5 per cent., and he doesn’t feel rich with a
tax receipt as he does with a debenture.
As already mentioned, it is proposed to spend
[■£lo,ooo,ooo this year on buying land. This ought
to make something of a boom —in fact, the pur-
chases for war settlement and closer settle-
ment have made a boom already. In 1915,
before the purchases of land for war settle-
ment had commenced, the value of land and
buildings bought and sold in N. S. Wales was a
little over £15,000,000. That, of course, mostly
represented town and citj 7 lands with their improve-
ments. If N. S. W r ales on a population basis gets
£3,500,000 of the new land expenditure it will
probably add 50 per cent, to the ordinary business
in unimproved land. And the trade must be con-
fined to places which can at least pretend to be
within reach of a big centre where there is a market,
so the ordinary land trading is likely to double in
the parts affected. This ought to shove up values
not only as regards the land purchased, but as re-
gards land for miles around, seeing that the pur-
chases don’t co§t anything except the cost of print-
ing the bonds —until the interest bill begins to be
felt. The increased land values will be quite a
lot more theoretical wealth. In fact, the business
has already spread far beyond the area of settle-
ment, and a boom is going on in city and suburban
allotments. Any fine Saturday many thousand
pounds’' worth of theoretical wealth is created round
Sydney alone by the turning of paddocks formerly
valued by the acre into building allotments valued
by the foot frontage.
The gold reserve is the basis of the note issue.
Both of them are the basis for the local loan, and so
long as the money borrowed is spent fast enough the
same note can be borrowed twice in a year. The
whole affair is the basis of the great increase in
land values. If the repatriated soldiers don’t as a
rule make a success of the land, then a sort of back-
wash will set in. A lot of the soil, both country and
suburban, will lose its inflated value, just as priceless
building allotments in Victoria reverted to grazing
purposes in the nineties of last century. The stop-
page of war loans, when there is no longer a war,
and the growth of the interest bill may bring along
a time when the investor, instead of paying £lOO
for a gilt-edged 5 per cent, per annum security, may
be paying £5O per annum for a dog-eared tax-
collector’s acknowledgment. The repatriated soldier
may in a great measure have to be provided for
afresh. He is a person of more or less experience,
who is put on a small and costly bit of land, which
the experienced former holder was glad to get rid of,
and he is told to grow produce for a market which
has already so much produce of the principal sorts
on hand that it may require 81 years to get rid of
it, If the Government would supply him with
500,000 more customers right here by putting its
whole soul into the establishment of industries to
make the things we are now importing at two or
three or six times their old cost, the repatriated
warrior might have a show.
I don’t know what we would have done without
the war and the partially-crippled soldier. By
manufacturing paper wealth and spending it locally
because there is a war in France, I reckon that
this year every family of five has about £1 3s. Id.
per week of theoretical wealth put to its credit,
this is apart from the theoretical wealth caused by
buying land for the returned soldier at a high price
and regarding the money he owes for it as more
theoretical wealth, also the theoretical wealth made
on the strength of all this excitement by calling a
paddock a desirable building site. The returned
soldier should be worth, this year, another 10s. or £1
of theoretical wealth per week for every family. of
five. And if this wealth is being pawned for hard
money with which to pay an outsider 7id. for a reel
of cotton, which was lately worth 2*d., it isn’t the
repatriated soldier's fault.
We Can Win—lf We Want To.
The steady turning of the tide of war has
created a new situation at other places
besides the battle-front. That it has turned
there is no longer a doubt, though there are
many long miles to go and many things to do
before the finish, and the United States
reckons on sending 3,000,000 or 4,000,000
more soldiers into the “muss,” and Australia
wants recruits as badly as ever for its de-
pleted battalions. For it is not merely an
ordinary question of victory. There is the
matter of gaining a chance of future peace
by breaking up an incredibly bumptious
Trust of Princes, which is so far from admit-
ting defeat that it is even now pegging out
new Hun kingdoms and apportioning the
1,600,000 miles of territory stolen from
Russia among fresh deputy Hun monarchs
all dependent on the two Kaisers, and fixing
up a Hun autocrat for Poland, and generally
dividing the earth, on paper.' The men of
the first French republic realised that there
could be no rest or safety till the old noblesse
learned that it was human, and must act
accordingly, and this war must go on till the
inflated Hun princes and tl\eir almost equally
inflated subjects get down to the same basis.
Still the tide has turned. All, or nearly all.
that was to be gained by the defection of
Russia has been gained, so that source of
aid has been used up. The last State in the
world that counts for much has come into the
war, and has come in on our side. The only
huge fresh modern army that the world can
dig up is fast coming into the war—on our
side. In France and Siberia, in Finland and
in Western Asia the Hun is not what he
was. All four sides of the quadrangle are
beginning to bulge just a little. Therefore
the “pacifist” traitors who play the game of
the. Hun autocrats and militarists and con-
scriptionists and capitalists begin to lose hold
of their most plausible argument. Awhile
ago they said : “We are true men and true
democrats. We loathe autocracies and big
armaments and military rule. But deci-
sive victory is impossible. Therefore
let us accept Hobson’s choice and
make the best peace we can, even if we
leave to the Hun the substantial profits of
victory, and let his military predominance
and his hope of ultimate world-dominion re-
main unbroken.” That lie lias had its dav.
It was always a lie, but in the worst days of
the war it was possible that some people
should mistake it- for truth. Now the fact
become clearer that decisive victory is possi-
ble, unless it is deliberately thrown away,
as the P.L.L. leaders apparently want it
to be. by the stoppage of the supply ot
recruits just when a little more effort is
required to end the 60 years’ misery of con-
stant terror and ruinous armaments. The
“pacifists” who clamor for a peace which will
leave the Hun still entrenched all over the
world, and the Little Peoples whom lie has
annexed in times past still under liis yoke
because of the “no-annexation” clause in
their programme, and his emperors still
supreme, and his policy of “a nation in
arms” still intact—these" pacifists can only
keep up the farce because they want the Hun
to win, or to lose without paying any penal-
ties if he must lose. There is no other excuse
left. And it is difficult to imagine that the
leaders of the Political Labor League have
become gratis apologists for emperors, mili-
tarists, murderers and upholders of abso-
lutism. That sort of thing isn’t done for
nothing. When a class which professes to be
shocked at a colorless State Governor or a
futile State Upper House, and declares an
implacable and truceless war against every
employer is so anxious to negotiate on even
terms with a Hohenzoixern, it is just the
boss traitor of the age.
Frank Tudor, Opposition-leader in the
House of Reps., lately delivered a lecture in
Melbourne on “The Right to Live,” and
passionately demanded what is the use of
putting up wages while the price of commo-
dities keeps going up and nullifying the
wages. Tudor might consider these points:
Even the very condensed quarterly Federal
Statistics for 1917 devoted 28 pages to the
names of things this country imports, and
in scores of cases it saved space by lumping
a multitude of things together as “all other
articles,” “minor articles,” ‘‘etc.,’’ and so on.
That is to say, there were 28 pages (repre-
senting £76,000,000 worth) of articles re-
garding most of which the foreign profiteer
fixes the price and mostly fixes it mighty
high these times. Frank Tudor, as a con-
vinced Protectionist, has made it his life-
long creed that the importing craze is
utterly disastrous. Yet he owes his politi-
cal position, his salary and his four spells
of Ministerial office to his membership of a
party which has agreed to drop the essen-
tial question of national prosperity. It is
a party in which Protectionists like Tudor
let the country’s prosperity slide so that they
might attract enough support from the crowd
which believes in the rich importing middle-
man, and in. the liberal influx into the coun-
try of goods which may be made by niggers,
non-unionists and sweated victims of the
outside profiteer, in order to give the oil-
and-water combination a chance of office. So
he was in a difficulty when he preached on
“The Right to Live.” He said that cotton
was 7id. a reel where it used to be 21d., but
he didn’t emphasise the fact that said" cotton
is imported, and that the sd. is put on by
the foreigner and collected by the im-
porter. He said that there were men
who gave £5O to a patriotic fund and then
fleeced the public of £5OOO extra profit; but
he didn’t stress the fact that that kind of
man is mostly an agent collecting the £5OOO
for some profiteer out of our reach, and that
if he runs an industry jierp the Government
has a habit of taking £3750 of the extra
money as war-time profit, and using it
for local benefit. Certainly he didn’t, for
very good reasons, specify any Australian
manufacturers who are in the dazzling situ-
ation that he described. Tijdor, as a fiscal-
sinker by profession, but not by conviction,
is in the position of an ardent Home Ruler
who is allowed to say everything he likes
provided he didn’t allude to Ireland.
—.
The Customs Department has partly removed
the veil of reticence re exports and imports.
The comings and goings of coin are not
recorded, but these few facts appeared. The
imports for July (latest figures published)
were £6,484,019, and if the whole year keeps
going at that rate there will be £77,500,000
worth of goods to pay for. The exports were
£5,163,668, and if the year goes on like that
there will be £62,000.000 worth of goods to
pay with. Seeing that Australia needs to
export about £20,000,000 more than it im-
ports to pay its foreign interest bills and
other liabilities, this isn’t a cheerful forecast.
The country paid over £1.900,000 in the month
for imported clothing, which is at the rate
of £22,800,000 a year. Apparently when it
can no longer pay for all this imported dress
or borrow it, it intends to go naked rather
than make its own rig-out. The goods that we
buy abroad are increasing, while the goods
that we sell abroad are diminishing. That
is largely because the things we buy are
small and light and dear, like jewellery and
silks; while the things we sell are large and
heavy and cheap, like wool and wheat and
meat. Therefore when shipping is scarce a
lot of our produce is bogged here and can’t
be got away. It was a common impression
that the importation of jewellery was
stopped, it being a costly luxury: but
“Jewellery, etc.,” stands for £121,416 for the
single month of July. The export of wool-
tops, which represented £149,166 for July,
1917 (say at the rate of £1,800,000 a year),
has stopped entirely. This branch of manu-
facture made its big profits almost entirely
at the expense of foreigners, and paid the
great bulk of them to the Government under
the War-time Profits law or something if the
sort, and spent the rest of them here. But
some sort of objection arose on the ground
that it was making too much profit—more
than any mere Australian industry ought to
make- —and amid the dust of the shindy it
closed up and 700 people were thrown out
of work. Maybe the managers were a bad
lot — The Bulletin knows little about
their characters, but being Australians it
will give them the disadvantage and draw-
back of the doubt —still an Australian manu-
facturing industry which makes money out
of the foreigner is so rare that its suspen-
sion is a matter for regret.
If there’s a better record than this, pass it
up. At a banquet given to Angus Gibson,
M.L.C., Bundaberg (Q.), on Sentember 20
an appeal on behalf of the War Loan re-
sulted in £79,000 being raised in less than 20
minutes.
“Jaeko”: Recently the Federal Govern-
ment closed down on the import of sheep-dips,
and set about encouraging their manufacture
locally. Sheen-owners protested. Watt re-
plied that there was plenty of the material
available locally, and that home-made sup-
plies would be distributed shortly to help
beat back the serious increase in the lice
pest. But the protests continued, and there
was talk that certain politicians were inter-
ested in Australian dip firms. The prejudice
against the Australian article is so deep that
many flocks are not being treated—dipping
isn’t generally compulsory yet—and the
quality of the wool both immediately and
ultimately through the encouragement of the
lice is being jeopardised.
The Fijians have chosen for their new
Governor Mr. C. H. Rod well, who looked
in on Sydney last week en route to his job.
The benighted heathen can still give a lead
to Democracy. The mere suggestion of a
plain “Mr.” as a Governor in Australia
would make Hughes, Holman and all the
rest of the gyrating Democrats reach for
the smelling-salts.
“Jean Sibi”: The Fine Art Society’s ex-
hibition of the late Hugh Ramsay's pictures
in Melbourne is a worthy attempt to revive
interest in a man whose work has been too
readily forgotten. Ramsay was only 29 when
he died in 1906, but he had reached a posi-
tion which struggling competitors will not
approach in years of effort. Forcefulness
and suavity were alike his, but he had the
genius to seize a subject and render its
salient facts without any of the mistaken
aids of fashionable photography. His tech-
nique is best observed in one of the subjects
of his final period, “The Sisters,” represent-
ing two young women who might have been
posed for the camera and yet are depicted
with a confident mastery of brushwork which
makes one forget the formality of the scene.
Everywhere there is evidence of this dexter-
ous, decisive painting. It is promising in his
early studio work —still-lifes and half-nudes:
but one can almost trace it growing pic-
ture by picture as the artist felt his way for-
ward to the results which startled critics into
minor enthusiasms about Velasquez and Sar-
gent. Probably Ramsay early succumbed to
the different forms of magic practised by
those very different masters, but for my part
I suspect that those boyish influences had
been suddenly extinguished as his hand began
to answer unerringly to his own eye and
brain. Portraits like “The Lady with
Fan,” the genre studies like “The Toper,”
the essays in colored mythology like “Venus
and Adonis,” and not forgetting a sheer piece
of virtuosity, “Nude Reclining,” all bear the
impress of Ramsay’s personality and estab-
lish his right to be remembered.
“Syd Mey”: A striking instance of the
indiscriminate use of flags can be seen in
Moore-street, Sydney, at the present time,
where a canvas-and-wood dummy Australian
destroyer floats proudly on the wood-blocks
in support of the War Loan. Ever since
H.M.A.S. Australia steamed into Sydney
Harbor the units of the Commonwealth fleet
have flown a -white ensign, at the stern and
the Australian flag at the bow. At least,
they have always done so while in port.
Now, is there any reason why the stage
destroyer in Moore-street should display the
Australian flag at her stern and the Union
Jack at her bow? If we must have these
shows, why not get the details correct?
Victorian trades-unionists have gone to
the expense of cabling to a foreign ruler —•
the President of the U.S. —in protest against
the imprisonment of one foreign I.WAV.
criminal and the execution of another on a
matter of murder, both after open trial.
The same body might send a protest to the
exceedingly I. WAV. Government of Russia
re many thousands of executions without
trial now going on at Moscow and elsew T here.
They profess to have in their midst one o!
the crowd which is doing the murders —one,
at least, in an official sense, so there is some-
body to transmit the protest.

After many weeks of brisk business in
Melbourne “Katinka” burst into song at Her
Majesty’s (Sydney) on Saturday; but
Florence Young, having caught a chill on the
train coming over, was not available to give
it a start. Addie Lennard stepped into
Florence’s shoes and acted with grace and
charm, but was hardly equal to the music.
She, too, seemed to be suffering from a cold.
Gladys Moncrieff, in the name-part, looks
well and sings brilliantly, though her enunci-
ation at times isn’t as clear as it might be.
She acts conscientiously, but her perfect
Australian self-possession doesn’t help the
illusion that she is a timid, runaway bride
who needs the protection of all hands if she
is to be saved from the pursuing Russian
bridegroom, a stolid, fair-bearded bully who
looks like a commissionaire in a new uni-
form. This character adds no gaiety to the
painted landscape. T.4 e very sentimental
show is concerned for three acts (and two
formidable intervals) with the running away
of Katinka on her wedding night, and there
is no rest for her until her Russian bride-
groom’s first wife (supposed to be dead)
bursts out of the Stamboul harem Katinka
has taken refuge in and leads the astonished
commissionaire home to drive him to vodka.
Phil Smith, as Thaddeus T. Hopper, is a
very English type of moral American hus-
band who becomes involved in the story
through racing Katinka away in his motor
by special request of the lady’s old mash
(Reg Roberts —and very nasal about it as
usual). Hopper’s wife and the wild Russian
bridegroom appear in Stamboul just after
the runaway girl has registered at the hotel
as Mrs. Hopper. When that situation is ex-
plained the play is over.
Most of the music is above the average
and it is worth hearing again. The set-
tings and costumes are elaborate, and the
dancing by Phyllis Amery, Cyril Ritchard
and Kitty Downes is good enough, without
being particularly clever. The show is most
impressive artistically when Olive Godwin,
who plays the Russian’s first wife, sings a
slow, sweet song at her harem window, and
a group of dancing girls, led by Wyonne
Haybittle, attitudinise in the usual tired
“Eastern” way in the middle of the street.
“THE PARISIAN MODELS," AT
SYDNEY GRAND
OPERA HOUSE.
Walter Graham, the human marionette,
and Philip 'Newbury, tenor.
George Welch, denuded of beery moustache
and red nose, cheerfully plays a perfectly
sober part; but all those who know what
he can do when stage drunk mourn silently.
Welch and Smith make the show go mer-
rily for a little while- in the third act; but
the quartette burlesque by four girls is a
sad occurrence. A vote of thanks goes to
the Royal Comic choristers, and another
to scenic artists W. R. Coleman and Geo.
Upward. The fluttering white pigeons that
have to listen to the human singers’ endless
“Rackety Coo” seemed on the opening night
to be trying to escape into the painted blue
skies. At the end of all the frivolity the
first-nighters sat amazed at the spectacle of
a nervous man with his hair on end asking
them in a quavering voice if “Katinka” was
a big success. They assured him it was.
The overwrought inquirer was producer
George Highland, and he looked as used up
as if he had been raiding a Hun trench
single-handed. So, after all, somebody
works harder than the audience.
“The Man Who Came Back” is still at
the Criterion (Sydney). He is a joyful
individual —after the average man’s heart.
The day when he will not come back seems
still afar.

“The Eyes of Youth” open at the Palace
(Sydney) on Saturday. Until then Emelie
Polini and her colleagues will work hard
imagining “The Invisible Foe.”
“Pierrot Pie No. 5” is now being handed
round at the Playhouse (Sydney). There
are the usual good musical side-dishes, but
the big plum is “The Man who Wouldn’t
Come Back,” a merry bit of burlesque built
on the Muriel Starr plav at the neighbor-
ing Criterion. It’s worth going to see the
originals o'f these gay trifles if only to appre-
ciate the humor of the travesties.
The second edition of “Vanity Fair” will
keep the Tivoli
(Sydney) going
over Saturday,
after which Jack
Waller and his fine
musical combina-
tion will pack up
their instruments.
Th e Repertory
(Sydney) was
crowded on Monday
evening as a tri-
bute to Miss May
Summerb elle, a
well-known musical
composer and press-
writer, who has
given much service
to patriotic objects.

the stage. Arthur
H. Adams had a

ing Out,” acted.
“The Man Who Came

Criterion.
Frank Harvey as
Captain Trevelan.
Mrs. T. H. Kelly had the principal part, and
was supported by her husband (his first
appearance on the stage) and Frederick Ward.
Miss Summerbelle played several of her
pianoforte compositions during the evening.
The Crystal Palace (Sydney) is throwing
the spotlight on Alice Brady in a story that
centres around a gambler’s flat, with Alice
as the siren. This film is a sound warning
to the crowd that backed Gloaming. At the
Lyceum Ellen Terry appears in “Her Great-
est Performance” ; on the same sheet Yaleska
Suratt wears wonderful garments and
juggles with millions and millionaires as
“A Rich Man’s Plaything.” She doesn’t
seem to mind. An O. Henry story is
pleasing Strand patrons; and the gentle
methods of Alice Joyce as Madeline Renard
find favor in all men’s sight. At Hoyt’s
and the Haymarket Doug. Fairbanks has
joined the Canadian mounted police, and
makes things lively under the title of “Head-
in’ South.” “The Lure of the Bush,” a well-
done Australian play, is attracting enthusi-
astic crowds to the Lyric. The Bulletin
called in for a second look last week and en-
dorses its first favorable impressions of the
picture.

Bright turns at the Majestic (Adelaide)
are Tom Rees (with doll), Louis Nikola
(with magic), Sa-Hera (with mind-reading)
and Paul Stanhope (with much revue girl).
At the Tivoli, “Her Forbidden Marriage”
gives Guy Hastings a suitable part as a fine
athletic hero. Fitzherbert is a truly villain-
ous villain, and Darcy Delway and the ver-
satile Maud Goldspink get in some absurd
comic relief. In the pictures West’s rely
chiefly on Constance Talmadge and her desire
to be a Studio Girl. Wondergraph has a
mixture of Dorothy Dalton, the knockabout
Mack Sennett, and the youthful Jack Pick-
ford in the “Bunker Bean" romance. The
Pav. ranges from Chaplin to a strong new
fighting man, Richard Travers, in “The Man
Trail.” But the biggest thing in sight is
“Cleopatra” at the Royal. It is doing hand-
some business. Rome and Egypt and the sea-
battle are finely filmed. It is weakened in
the opinion of the writer by the fact that the
charmer is played by Theda Bara, a great
actress, doubtless, in some respects.
“Business Before Pleasure” brought Pot-
ash and Perlmutter back to the Royal
(Melb.) on Saturday. Since they were last
on the premises the quarrelsome partners
have deserted the rag trade for the movie in-
dustry without adding to their store of in-
human wisdom or advancing the reputation
of Yiddish dialect humor. Their patter is
not up to the level of the diverting perver-
sions of the original play. They have not the
original capacity for making simple proverbs
monumental, and their impromptus sound as
if they had been contrived laboriously. Never-
theless, they offer some good dialogue, and
at times their idiotic conduct, caused
by the overwhelming of their pizness in-
stincts by their natural benevolence, alter-
nates from pure comedy to the liveliest farce.
Their quixotic championship of their tame
Vampire against the machinations of a per-
sistent Lothario is a particular ex-
ample of their characters. The episode
involves the partners in ruin and threat-
ens to throw Abe on the mercy of a
Divorce Court Judge, but the pair never
quiver at the consequences so long as Virtue
emerges unsullied from the fray. Abe’s and
Mawruss’s rush to the rescue is scarcely
credible in the circumstances; but it is the
improbability of the whole business that
multiplies the opportunities for healthy up-
roar. “Business Before Pleasure” is
bolstered by exaggeration. Whenever it gets
near to reality its force is exploded.
* * * *
The slips of film that are switched on in
Acts I. and 11. are the only patches of com-
parative silence in an extremely talky play.
The bulk of the conversation falls to the
principals, Nick Adams (Perlmutter) and
James Waters (Potash). Adams seems the
better of the two, because he owns the cheer-
ful obtrusiveness that goes with an assertive
Hebrew countenance, whereas Waters’
Hebrew vivacity is neutralised by a face of
obviously Gentile cut. Both have the habit
of watching and waiting for their laughs,
which suggests a long and continuous ex-
perience on the vaudeville stage. Rosie
Pai-kes, as the movie Vampire, is a mana-
gerial imprudence. Her voice is just nice
enough to eat muffins with. And her attempts
to register “jealousy,” “invitation,” etc., on
the screen fail badly. Her hubby, Harold
Parkes (George Edwards), speaks his few
lines in a manly, uninspired fashion; whilst
Roland Conway plays the bad Robert Blanch-
ard without the remotest suggestion of revel-
ling in his sinfulness. Maggie Moore, Elsie
Manzies, Edmund Sherras and others merely
amount to intermittent audiences for P. and
P., and it frequently requires all their his-
trionic genius to simulate an appearance of
interest in the pair.

“McClure and the Parson,” revived at the
King’s on Saturday, afforded Melbourne its
first sight of Bert Bailey in the tawny side
whiskers of Meester McClure. Ned Duggan
formerly played the explosive Scotch tyrant,
and was a more sedate exponent of the
character than Bailey. The latter, however,
has the countenance that looks well over a
glass of whusky, and his accent would admit
him just as quickly into exclusive Hieland
society as his wonderful tartan would push
him out. There never was such a tartan.
He professes to sleep in it. but it probably
keeps him and the whole blessed neighboi’hood
awake. Grade Dorran played the part of a
generous Providence to the absent soldier (J.
Lennon), and the poor parson was Harcourt
Hare. Ned Duggan was the hard-fisted Jacob
Wattleton. Leslie Woods lurked in the
whiskers of farmer Morrow, were Fred Mac-
donald (Bill Eaglefoot) and Lilias Adeson
(Daphne) were in their old parts, and the
vicissitudes of their courtship, with all the
delicious bits of jealousy and low cunning,
added tremendously to the gaiety of the show.

The exouisite spectacle of Maud Fane in
pyjamas still vies with Detective Frith’s
black eye for the beauty prize in “Oh, Boy,”
at Her Majesty’s (Melb.). The curious
thing about the pair is that they both acquire
their adornments by accident, but whereas
Maud embezzled hers during a nocturnal
adventure, Frith happened to be in the way
when his was passing. It is not often that
even a stage John Hop gets a clout on the
eye, wherefore Maud, who is alleged to have
bestowed the disaster, deserves at least
another pair of pyjamas for distinguished
conduct.
* * * *
This is the last week of “Honi Soit” at
the Tivoli (Melb.). Monday will probably
see a new diversion with comedian Jack
Waller as a prominent feature.
Hoyt’s Melbourne supporters are having an
enjoyable week. Douglas Fairbanks is
bounding about on his way “Headin’ South,”
and wherever he lands trouble appears in
overwhelming quantities. Hazel Dawn, as
“The Sales Lady,” is also noticed among
“BUSINESS BEFORE PLEASURE," AT
MELBOURNE ROYAL.
Mawruss Perlmutter (Nick Adams ) and
Potash (James R. Waters) talk over their
business worries.
the current traffic across Hoyt’s screens, whilst
Virginia Pearson, billed conspicuously at the
Lyceum, is frequent in “When False Tongues
Speak.”
** * *
Angels in gambling hells are not unknown,
and one of the best of them can be discovered
in “The Whirlpool” at the Britannia (Melb.)
this week. Indeed, this one almost gets into
class A by her uncommon self-sacrifices in
the interests of a gay young man. At the
Melba the programme opened on Monday
with the seven-act feature, “The Unwritten
Law,” wherein Beatriz Michelena becomes
unexpectedly homicidal in a fierce endeavor
to protect her offspring. Mary Pickford takes
the screen again to-day in one of her greatest
draws, “A Good Little Devil.”
Another Melbourne show :
The Australian Art Association’s show at the
Athenaeum is the same old record of manners and
styles struggling for advertisement. This year
the Meldrum school, represented by A. E.
Newbury, gives the eye a jolt with “A Portrait of
a Young Lady,” which carries the Meldrumish method
somewhat beyond the eccentric decorum observed by
the founder. Near by, Bernard Hall exhibits a more
academic technique in two or three well-drawn nudes
and heads merged into tableaux by banners of color.
The late Fred McCubbin lives again, exultant, in two
characteristic chants in pea-green. W. B. Mclnnes,
suddenly surrendering to the fashion for portraiture,
has painted two safe subjects with a brush that
has been disciplined to the gentlest behavior. His
landscapes, of olive green to suit his fancy, depict
expanses of pastoral contentment. Leslie Wilkie
presents a ‘‘Lady in Black,” which has strong pic-
torial qualities without marked physical interest.
Another portrait, of a flapper in cream seated on a
chair, has the comparatively startling effect of an
impromptu. Pen Boj'd’s spirit finds an outlet in a
large, heroic offering, “The Saphead,” but the result
is only arresting in its military details. A dashing
bit of Spring sunshine has been captured by Norman
Macgeorge to lighten a bit of the gloom of the
south wall of the exhibition. W. J. McNally, whose
achievements are almost as sombre as those of
Harold Herbert, imparts, however, a suggestion of
poetry and fantasy to his subjects. McClintock’s
talent appears to have gone into retirement,
and Miss Wilson and Miss Cumbrae Stewart
continue to be complimentary to their sex
in chocolate-box nudes. J. R. Jackson, of
N. S. Wales, makes a very pleasing decoration out of
a scrap of old garden, and W. D. Knox reminds one
of Mclnnes in the unexampled vistas he encloses in
gold frames. Edward Officer’s contributions, especi-
ally “Giverny, Normandy,” can be mentioned with
approval, and F. G. Reynold’s “Incoming Tide” is
less to be blamed than William Frater’s distressing
portrait of his wife. Clewin Harcourt’s “Painter
of Men” lacks his usual photographic veracity. As
for his thickly-pigmented “Fitzroy Gardens,” it
compels one to hope that the too, too solid paint
might melt, fall, and resolve itself into a view.
The second big locomotive turned out
by the Perry works at Gawler (S.A.)
was made the occasion of a lunch to
engineers, politicians and railway experts
from Adelaide. One engine is already on the
Bast-West rails, but this one, owing to the
foolishness of breaks of gauge, has to be
trucked to Port Augusta to start its work.
Tbv*.'- sr*e “Ka” class engines of over 123 tons,
as against about 88 tons, S.A.’s biggest pre-
vious production. They cost £BOOO apiece
and have to do 2000 miles satisfactorily, with
a capacity of 40 miles an hour (if wanted),
before being paid for. The Perrys have a
contract for six of them, and the work has
done much to keep the old reputation of
Gawler for engineering works alive. During
the four years the contract has been running,
some of the material has gone up from £ll a
ton to £B5.

The figures in the last line are approximate
only, it having been reckoned, for purposes
of comparison, that £6OO of the bonuses on
purchases will not be claimed, and that
something like £340 will be paid as a bonus
to the staff. The co. never does as well in
the July term as it does in the half-year
which includes the Christmas festivities, but
for the past six months, despite high prices
ruling, the turnover was less than it was for
the same term last year:—

However, though the turnover was smaller,
exes, have been kept down. The secret of
this co-operative co.’s success is that it is
purely a cash business. Its capital is an insig-
nificant £27,783 (held by 9876 shareholders —
for one £1 share qualifies for all the bonus
benefits), it has borrowed £5250 on mort-
gage. and all its other liabilities amount to
less than £30.000. Yet the yearly turnover
exceeds £370,000. The society has accumu-
lated reserves of £50,608, and it has nothing
invested in freeholds. Even so, the trading
figures are possible only by strict cash deal-
ing. And because its customers pay cash
(£8941 was all that was owing at July 31),
the society is itself able to pay cash to
the wholesale merchants and receive dis-
count (£2353 for the past half-year, and
equal to almost 23 p.c. of the net profit) :
and it is also able to carry substantial
stocks. £74,199. The 10 p.c. dividend and
the 10 p.c. bonus on purchases look very
handsome, but what they are really worth to
customer-shareholders depends entirely oh
the retail prices. The society caters for a
high-class trade, and if its prices are a
little above the ordinary then the bonus is
not all it looks. The dividend certainly
isn’t, for on shareholders’ capital and re-
serves the rate is really equivalent to less
than 4 p.c. Nevertheless, it is obvious
from the turnover figures that the society
is giving a service which is considered satis-
factory by co-operators. The co-operative
principle should be further extended to help
the poorer worker, who is hit harder by
the higher cost of living than anybody.
By cutting out the middleman and trading
on a purely cash basis, the workman’s £1
might easily be given an increased purchas-
ing value. There is at least one Sydney
suburban society—the Balmain Co-operative
—which is paying a regular bonus of 2s. in
the £3 on purchases in this way.

The Bulletin won’t guarantee some of the
figures in that last line : the accounts do not
disclose the amount paid in bonuses and re-
bates. But apparently it was in the vicinity
of £14,000. For the year to July, 1917, the
usual 84 p.c. dividend was lowered to 7 p.e.
to provide for taxation.- The co. is
now paying over £20,000 more per annum
in taxes than four years ago: 1914. £4138 :
1915, £4848: 1916, £8820; 1917, £14,784:
1918, £24,645. Profits shown in the table
have also been cut down lately by bonuses,
etc., to employees; from last year's figures
£3OOO has been voted to help employees who
have enlisted, £3500 has been paid out in
bonuses on salaries, and £lOOO was contri-
buted to a superannuation fund.
This big co-operative farmers’ co. con-
tinues to expand—674 new co-ooerators
joined up last year, and paid capital has
grown by £45,324 during the year. There
are now 8416 co-operatinsr farmers, and sub-
scribed capital is £816,675, of which
£536,910 is paid up. The co. was started in
a small way in 1881, and some idea of its
rapid growth is given in this comparison:—

1915 .. 4,028,609 185,570 50,950
Apart from income-tax and the special appro-
priations for its soldier-employees, all other
expenses absorbed £103.335: so it costs
£2 11s. 3d. to handle every £lOO of farmers’
produce and other merchandise—though this
£2 11s. 3d. includes other exes, such as
extending the co.’s organisation. Anything
in excess of these exes, is available for dis-
tribution among the co-operating farmers;
and in addition to the 84 p.c. dividend on capi-
tal last year, 25 p.c. was rebated on commis-
sion charges and a 4 p.c. bonus was distributed
on shareholders’ purchases of merchandise,
etc. In 10 years no Jess than £419,779 has been
paid to co-operators by way of dividend, re-
bate and bonus. Deduct from that total a
reasonable amount to cover fair interest
return on capital invested—though iii most
cases if the co-operators’ little bit had not
gone into this co. it probably would not have
been invested otherwise —and you get an idea
of what this co-operative co. has saved the
Canterbury farmers. But not only has the
co. put hundreds of thousands of pounds into
the farmers’ pockets which would otherwise
have helped to fatten the middlemen, a
powerful financial institution has also been
built up.
In addition to handling co-operators’ pro-
duce, etc., the cos also does a Jot of financing.
The figures are shown in this comparison :

Owing to shipping difficulties there has been
a big increase in advances and also ,in the
amount of stock held during the past couple
of years. Of the deposits £93,235 is fixed for
12 months, the remaining £390,725 being
fixed from two to live years. Of t other debts
£383,337 represents the amount at credit of
shareholders’ current accounts, showing a
substantial increase of £150,000 on the
figures of 1914. But the security for the
co.’s debts is very good. All liabilities,
apart from capital, amount to £972,059.
Assets, other than advances, property and
plant, total £829,925. And to meet the
£142,734 of liabilities not represented by
more or less liquid assets there is £OO9,Sv,
in advances and £200,824 in property.
Besides the benefits the Canterbury pri-
mary producer has got from his co.. its
success has had a big influence in helping the
co-operative movement elsewhere in Maoriland
and in the Commonwealth. The movement
is growing very rapidly nowadays: four
months ago the first inter-State conference
of co-op. cos. was held in Melbourne, and as
a result still further efforts are being made
to cut out the middleman. In Maoriland
there is even a scheme that has been agreed
upon for the various co-op. bodies to form a
shipping co. with a capital of'six millions to
carry co-operators’ products to their markets.
Of course, owing to war conditions the
scheme has not matured; but it is possible
that it will be gone on with later on.

The Farmers’ and Settlers’ Co-opera-
tive Insurance Co. <?f Australia. —This
co.'s one object is to cheapen the cost of
insurance for the man on the land. The idea
of the promoters was that by confining the
■issue''of shares to those who placed business
with the co. (shares being allotted propor-
tionately to the amount of insurance) the
policy-holders would thus secure whatever
profit the co. made for distribution
among themselves. But the scheme should
do more than give co-operators the profits
which other cos. would make out of their
business ; for the policy-holder, having a pro-
prietary interest in the co.. should send in
his renewals automatically without canvass,
thus further saving the co. the expense of
travelling exes., commissions, etc., which
under ordinary circumstances insurance cos.
have to meet to renew business.
This co. has now been going three years,
but while there is not the slightest doubt
as to its possibilities the management lias
apparently had a fairly difficult task to convince
Cocky as to the benefits of co-operation.
The co. is operating in N. S. Wales, Vic. and
S. Aus., and in N. S. Wales particularly—
except in the coastal areas—the primary pro-
ducer has had little or no practical experi-
ence of co-operation. Still, during the past
couple of years there has been a big advance
in applying the co-operative principle to
handling farmers’ produce. The N. S. Wales
Farmers’ and Settlers’ Association formed a
co-operative grain co., which has shown good
results. However, this co-operative insurance
co. is going ahead —about five times the
amount of business being done last year
compared with that of two years ago. Gross
premiums have been: 1916, £8849; 1917,
£20,336; 1918, £42,808. Here is a further
comparison :
Year to Net ■ Net
July, Premiums. Claims. Exes.' Profits.
1910.. £6,540 £ll7l £2,980 £3076
1917.. 11,910 4911 0,400 1653
1918.. 24,024 8282 14,713 2,078
The loss rate has thus worked out at: 1916,
17.9 p.c.; 1917, 41.2 p.c. (due to exceptional
hail losses) ; 1918. 34.5 p.c. Expenses arc?
still heavy; chiefly because the co. has to go
out chasing new business in competition with
the big, old-established cos., and spend a lot
oc money trying to convince Cocky as to the
advantages of co-operation. But there is
another reason why the expenses for the past
year have been so heavy. Being a new co.,
without any pre-war standard of profits, the
ridiculous War-time Profits Tax claims a
big proportion of any profits made. So, as
the chairman told shareholders, “the direc-
tors thought it advisable to push forward
with vigorous organisation work rather than
pay away, in the form of taxation under this
Act, practically the whole of our profits.”
However, it seems that Treasurer Watt now
proposes to relieve these infant cos. of this
unjust burden.
Capital paid up by co-operators at the end
of the first year (1916.) was £16,337; it is
now £30,026, representing the holding of over
four thousand policy-holders. That means
that the co. now has a large number of poli-
cies which it should be able to renew without
much trouble or expense. Liabilities amount
to £4276. The co. has £26,746 in cash. War
Loan, deposits and due by sundry debtors,
£1649 in motor-cars, furniture and odds and
ends, while £7986 of the capital is repre-
sented by establishment expenses (which has
been written down by £1333 during the past
year).

Take all other breweries, the Cascade a year
ago was feeling the effect of increasing costs,
while there was no corresponding increase
in selling prices. The mainland breweries
devised a neat arrangement by which they
were able, to lift wholesale and retail prices
slightly, and at the same time prevent any
price-cutting between competitive pubs. The
arrangement worked out very well; and by
and bye this Hobart brewery followed suit
and raised its prices. Here are the figures
for recent .Tune half-years :—-

Note how the interest on outside money in
the business is gradually diminishing. Dur-
ing the five years covered by the above com-
parison the co. has reduced its debts by
£41,354. Capital is £lOB,OOO made up of
150,000 £1 Is. shares paid to 16s. —they
used to be 30s. shares paid to 255.. but 9s.
per share was written off in 1902. But
while capital and reserves total £143,457.
there is no less than £174,111 tied up in the
Cascade estate, in the co.'s three breweries —
Walker’s, Grade’s and Cascade—and in pub
properties and premises. So the co. has had
to depend a good deal on outside money.
This shows how the balance-sheet figures
have moved in five years:—

Thus the debt is being gradually reduced.
Some •of the unproductive portion of the
properties—chiefly the Cascade estate —have
been unloaded as opportunity offered, while
in five years there has been a considerable
reduction in book debts. The payment of a
modest G p.c. dividend has also enabled the
management to hold on to some of the pro-
fits, and that has helped to lift the load.
During the past five years £34,084 has been
distributed among shareholders, and £17,009
has been added to reserves. The Cascade
has built up a splendid reputation with its
products, and almost every half-yearly re-
port refers to the expansion of the co.’s
trade with the mainland, and even the Far
North is showing a growing desire for the
ML Wellington brew\ From a climatic and
water-supply point of view r the Cascade has
everything to its advantage.

The war has cut out one source of this co.’s
revenue; its public radio telegraphic busi-
ness, which had been gradually growing when
war interfered; has been discontinued, princi-
pally to protect shipping. Further, private
wireless plants have been entirely sup-
pressed. But there have been compensa-
tions. A rapidly-increasing number of ves-
sels is being equipped with the co.’s wireless
apparatus, and the factory has considerably
increased its output during the half-year,
but since most of these instruments were
for the co.’s own use—presumably to be
leased and operated by the co.’s own offi-
cers —little extra profit shows up for the
half-year’s operations. The factory is now
doing a lot of electrical manufacturing and
repair work, and as this work shows promise
of further expansion the directors have
decided to establish a subsidiary co. —Aus
tralectric, Ltd. —the whole of the capital
being held by the Amalgamated Wireless.
Reserves are labelled “nominal” in the
table, because of the capital of £140,000 no
less than £90.000 represents patent rights.
But on the other side reserves of £25,305
have been accumulated against “patents,
depreciation and marine insurance.” Dis-

exclusive agencies item gives this compari-

securities. A year ago the co. was running
a motor-car agency—it bad £28,500 in “in-
vestments in other cos.” But this agency
wafc abandoned, and presumably the amount
not required for extending the wireless busi-
ness was put into War Loan. There is
undoubtedly a big future for wireless teleg-
raphy, but the prospects of this co. after
the war ai*e dependent a good deal on the
extent to which the Commonwealth Govern-
ment goes into she business.

When Alurninoferric is used in connection with
reservoirs its application is extremely simple. The
cakes or slabs (which measure 22in. x Tin. x Gin. and
weigh about 561 b. each) are placed on edge in a per-
forated wooden box, or other suitable cage, at the
inflow to the reservoir, and as the slabs dissolve
readily the rate of Alurninoferric applied is in-
creased or diminished in proportion to the rise or
fall of the water passing, and may be readily regu-
lated to a nicety. One pound will clarify" up to
3000 gallons of most turbid waters. Particulars from

For grinding all classes of material in Ball Mills
and Tube Mills it is necessary to have a suitable
grinding medium. The mines in West Australia,
also numerous cement plants, are using balls of forged
tyre steel, and find that they give excellent results.
These balls may be obtained in various sizes from
the Austral Otis Engineering Co. of Melbourne, who
have put in a special plant for forging them, and
can give delivery of most sizes from stock. This
company also manufactures forged steel shoes and

try during the past couple of years has not
made more difference to the co.’s figures—
the trading profit is practically what it was
five years ago. However, there is a big mar-
gin between profits and dividends. A feature
of the co.’s accounts is the big allowance for
depreciation of plant. The Marshall co. six
years ago owned all its own plant, instead of,
as is almost the universal custom, installing
machines on a royalty basis from the Shoe
Machine Trust. A plant renewal reserve
was established, and apparently a lot of the
old machinery has also been superseded,
which probably partly explains the £33,558
shown as written off in the table. From the
profits of the past two years alone an amount
equal to nearly 10 p.c. of the capital has
been thus appropriated. However, when these
special allowances are no longer considered
necessary the ordinaries will, no doubt, get
a little more in dividends. That is, of
course, if profits can be maintained, and
there is no visible reason why they should
not. Australian-made footwear has gained
a fine reputation, not only locally, but
abroad.

“Quidam” : If the amendments to the N. S.
Wales Mining Act become law they are going
to cause a stir in industrial-metal mining
circles. Wherever copper and silver-lead
propositions are to be found one runs against
the legal snag that prohibits attacking pro-
perties held as freehold or’C.P. when they
contain the industrial metals, though entry
can be gained in the case of gold. The re-
marks of mining men relative to people who
practically delete valuable portions of Aus-
tralia from the map, especially at a time
when the world is calling loudly for large
supplies of industrial metals, are forcible and
very impolite; but so far the remarks have
not stirred either political party. If the pro-
posed amendments do become law, a wild yell
of anguish from the tribe of wealthy land-
owners will be heard. One of the worst curses
this country ever imported was the principle
of allowing valuable mineral deposits to
become private monopolies for a few pounds.
The one outstanding virtue is that posterity
will ultimately receive practically intact many
properties that would otherwise have been
worked long ago.

“Tin Miner” : What is wanted with regard
to metals is exactly what Cocky demands with
respect to the Wheat Board. If a Tin Pro-
ducers’ Association is to be established, the
producers should secure all the advantages,
and not the outside entrepreneur. If the
producer isn’t to rule, then an absolute State
bureau, which shall disseminate news to all
and sundry, is the best arrangement. Rumor
talks of a deal covering the Kelly and
Bischoff tin smelters, of regulations to pro-
hibit the export of tin ore unless handled
by the Association, and so on. If the State
is to run the whole business, and at the end
of each half-year is to publish a list of the
commissions earned, the people garnering
them, the charges made, and is to see that
the spirit as well as the letter of the Metals
Exchange is observed, viz., that stock-
brokers or their pals are to be kept out, then
confidence may exist. While on this sub-
ject of metal associations, why is it that
somebody in the Federal House has not
asked for a return of the quantities of metal
handled, and the commissions gorged in the
process? This has been done in the wheat
pools; so a precedent exists for a similar
return in regard to metals.

At the old Mt. Costigan mine (N.S.W.)
Joe Collins, well known around Bathurst and
Newbridge, is precipitating cqpper from the
mine water on scrap-iron. The richness of
the water in acid and copper shows that
whatever came out of Costigan, a lot of metal
has been left behind. Worked first as a
silver-lead proposition, Mt. Costigan at 200 ft.
or so became a copper-mine, also carrying
gold and silver, but eventually ran into the
usual difficulties attached to a refractdry
mixture of various metals, including the
smelter’s bugbear, zinc. When once the pro-
blem of economically treating complex ores
is satisfactorily settled, Mt. Costigan, Cordil-
lera, Sunny Corner, Lewis Ponds and many
others will assuredly become of value. So
far, the prodigality of Nature in carelessly
mixing too many good metals together, has
led to a lot of good enterprise and hard cash
going astray.
Bourke’s Hill, Emmaville (N.S.W.), was
unable to increase its output during the half-
year to August 31 owing to insufficient
labor, but even though there was also an
increase in working costs the net profit for
the term was £4072, a lift of £lOl3
compared with the previous half-year. This
result, of course, was due to the phenomenal
rise in the tin market, concentrates realising
£241 per ton delivered in Sydney. During
the half-year 70,593 cub. yds. were sluiced
for almost 35 tons concentrates. Working-
costs increased from 9.922 d. to 11.179 d. per
yard. Three sixpennies (£3375) were dis-
tributed..
An argument was recently heard by the
mining-warden with respect to the working
of a felspar deposit at Lithgow (N.S.W.).
The present holders of the area- —Basser and
Morris- —applied for relief on the ground that
there was no market in Australia for the
mineral. To which Edward Brownfield, a
consulting chemist, recognised as an expert
in the pottery line (he holds five inter-
national medals) offered the opinion that the
deposit was worth a lot and that he was pre-
pared to work the lease on the strength of
orders from the Clyde Engineering Co. for
white enamel, as well as contracts from
other firms. Brownfield reckoned that about
2000 tons of excellent grade felspar was to
be got out of the show, in addition to about
4000 tons of granite. lie had a plant at
Redfern worth £2OOO. Evidence having been
given to show that the lease had not been
worked for 10 months, the warden turned
down the application for suspension of labor
conditions.

As new mines are becoming scarce on the
best-known goldfields in Westralia, pros-
pectors are beginning to turn their attention
to some of the almost-forgotten ones.
Amongst these is the Nor’-West Ashburton,
which at one time contained a number of
small centres of activity, all of which are
now deserted. In 1592 over a thousand
diggers were fossicking on the Ashburton,
but after getting a fair amount of gold,
mostly alluvial, they nearly all quitted on
receipt of reports of rich finds at Cool-
gardie, Kalgoorlie and beyond. Although
big quartz outcrops occur in many places,
the field has never been prospected for reefs.
Scarcity of water has been the chief trouble.
The cost of transport has also hitherto made
it impossible for any but very rich ore to
pay.
* * * *
From G. D. Meudell: —
The Mayor of Ballarat (Vic.) is circulating a most
informative pamphlet, entitled “Mining Reform and
Millions,” explaining a plan to revive gold-mining by
treating it as an ordinary business and not as a
Stock Exchange or gambling counter. The author,
C. E. Walker, starts with the fact that when gold
was discovered in Victoria only primitive Cornish
methods were used for extracting it from quartz or
alluvial dirt. There was no machinery in use for
crushing quartz properly, and everybody was ignorant
of the geology of the reefs. Experience has taught
that in our quartz zones there are only certain belts
in which the lodes will be found gold-bearing as they
cut them, and once a lode leaves the belt, no more
gold need be expected until the next similar channel
of country is cut by the lode. Systematic crosscut-
ting is essential for the successful development of
any mine known to be gold-bearing. Brough Smyth,
Ulrich, Reginald Murray, E. J. Dunn and numerous
other of the old-time geologists noted that the lodes
were rich or poor in accordance with the country
they were cutting. The truth is that our quartz-
mining from the beginning has been on too small a
scale. We have opened a lot of little mines raising
mere handfuls of ore for crushing in small batteries,
instead of developing a few big mines with big, wide
shafts hoisting large quantities of dirt to be
treated by hundreds of heads of stamps. It
was that illusive and delusive “shoot of gold” so dear
to the hearts of the old pioneers of Bendigo and
Ballarat which shaped our gold-mining on the wrong,
small scale that has led to its decay and death. We
ought to copy the big Rand mines and take out all
the auriferous dirt as it comes, whether it carries
2dwt. or 42dwt. per ton, and put it through in 10
times the quantity we have been accustomed to treat.
Fifty thousand tons of pay-dirt crushed in a year is
considered wonderful work in Victoria, where
there are mines capable, if properly developed, of
giving that amount of crushing stuff every fort-
night. Some years ago in London I analysed
the balance-sheets of 68 Rand mines. The
average value of the ore was lOdwt. gold,
and tile working costs per ton averaged 18s.
Some of those Rand mines had to sink to
2000 ft. to reach the banket, and then they got
gold in 2,3, 4 and 5 inches of reef containing from
2dwt. to 32dwt. of gold. But everything is sent to
the tube mills and batteries. The Rand banket is
terribly hard and costly to work compared with our
free-milling soft white quartz. On the Rand they
never dream of sinking a shaft till the ground has
been exhaustively bored with the diamond-drill. Why
do we not adopt the same practice in Victoria? The
use of the diamond-drill would have saved an immense
waste of money in prospecting, and the expenditure
of more money on dead work and less in chasing
the shoot of gold” would have given more
stability to our gold-mining industry. Our
custom has been to look for rich shoots, pick
them out quickly, crush the stuff in a tinpot
10-head battery, declare a dividend before the gold
had cooled off in the melting-house, and, if need be,
make a call next month to begin again the hunt
after “the shoot of gold.” It is a virtual necessity
it gold-mining is to be revived, as it will and must
be in Australia, to adopt modern methods and modern
machinery. AVe ought to start a mine with more
capital on hand, sink big shafts, ventilate the mine
properly, spend all the money in opening up dozens
of faces of ore, and drag- out all the auriferous stone,
not in hundreds but in thousands of tons. Then it
is time enough to buy 100-head of stamps to crush
all the dirt of whatever value it may be, low or high
grade. In that way will the rich pockets be regu-
larly mixed with the low-grade quartz and be taken
as they come instead of being picked. Fancy what
a difference it would make to Bendigo, where they
now rely on railway workshops and jam and candle
factories for a living, while millions of tons of low-
grade quartz are exposed in the mines, and hundreds
of millions of more tons exist untouched on a proved
gold-field eight miles long containing 13 axial lines
of gold-bearing country. There are literally millions
of tons of low-grade quartz to be seen in the Ballarat
East mines waiting for the advent of electric power,
light and ventilation, for the day of big shafts and
modern crushing plants and educated mining managers.
Mining has been slain in Victoria as much by igno-
rant management as by increased costs, frauds, spec-
selling, promoters’ shares and royalties. It has been
conducted by small directors, uneducated and un-
scientific, who always had one eye on the half-
sovereign Board fee and the other on the Stock
Exchange price-list. Our mining men have created
some of the greatest mines on earth, like the Great
Boulder, Mount Lyell, Mount Morgan, Mount Bischoff
and Broken Hill Proprietary, and our miners are still
the best in the world. Surely they can tackle and
solve a simple business proposition such as this one
of re-creating our gold-mining industry.

The loss of £340 shown by the Block 10

75 p.c. gave a return of 375. 4d. per ton
from 320 tons, so with mine costs at 20s. 34d.
the margin is not big enough even to cover
administration charges. The only way out
must be to work on a big scale. That calls
for more plant; which means more calls,
thus establishing The Bulletin’s old warn-
ing that the co. was over-capitalised, and
that Block 10 would have to put up a lot
more cash than the original £30,000.

A clear run of six months without a strike
is a novelty at the Jumbunna coal-mine,
G-ippsland (Vie.), but the past term has
been a record in that respect. Yet peace
did not lead to big yields, for a nest of
faults had to be driven through to reach
settled country. Away from the big bredk
between the north and the east tunnels
good coal shows, but profits depend a
lot on Labor. Though there has been
no stoppage of work lately the union
is out after a minimum for miners of
16s. 6d. a day and sjj days’ pay per week to
men who, through no fault of their own, are
off work for a week or any portion of a week.
Chairman Boyd says it can’t be done; so
the matter is to go to the Court. Boyd’s
case is that the miner earns good money, as
it is, by working five shifts a week. Jum-
bunna made y profit of £769 for the half-
year. and has liquid assets of £6585 against
£2626 of liabilities.

Water has washed out development below
1300 ft., at Lyell Blocks (Tas.), so the 4 p.c.
ore opened in the winze isn’t to get its own
treatment plant. Stoping over the 1200 ft.
level made it possible to send 468 tons of 8
p.c. ore to the Lyell smelters last half-year,
and another 500 tons has been got on the road
since then. Obviously these shipments only
bring in enough cash to expose the poverty
of the land. With the drill going into schist
country at 1100 ft. anything may happen, as
manager Carroll points out. The trouble is
that the investor is getting wearied of all
the shoots of. bornite sticking just inside the
North Lyell instead of meandering over the
Blocks line.

_ Tongkah Compound since 1911 has sold
tin of a net value of £326.701 as the result
of winning tons oxide from 3,906,000
cub. yards of driPt. The lean periods were
in 1914-15, when profits fell from 214 d. per
cub. yard to sid., and in 1916-17,” when
nothing was earned, owing to the plant
having to dredge a way to a new lease. This
so far has averaged a net value of from 16|d.
to 20-Jd. per cub. yard, but costs have leaped
to 71G. against the old average of about 6d.
They_ don’t hold on to profits in the Com-
pound, for of the £15,007 earned last half-
year only £7 was undistributed, while the
£lO,OOO of cash and tin on hand is to be cut
into to pay a couple more divs. With tin
bringing in about £l5O per ton concentrates
it is safe to live up to income.

strong and Heady again. It would be
impossible to enumerate all the things that
are tried with ihese objects in view, but it
is a well-known fact that bitro-phosphate
pioduces better results in less time than
ordinary sedative and stimulants. More-
over, this method of treatment is commended
because it is recognised that bitro-phosphate
does not produce ill-effect and no reaction
follows its use. This establishes it as a safe
and reliable specific for use in cases of neu-

etc., and it is certain that as sufferers come
to realise its efficacy they will discard drugs
and artificial stimulants and take bitro-phos-

E. P. Simpson, ex-Chicf Judge in Equity,
did not enjoy his retiring pension more, than
>1 couple of months. He was 75 years of
•igo when the clock stopped. E.P. was the
son of George Simpson, a barrister of Lin-
coln s Inn, and’ was himself called to the
English Bar in ISOS. Thirteen years later
he came to Sydney and was admitted to the
local Bar, and set his talents to the equity
and bankruptcy side. On the death of Jus-
tice Charles Manning, in 1898, Simpson was
offered and accepted the vacancy on the
Equity Bench, and became the Chief Judge
in that jurisdiction. It used to be a poor joke
that he had never taken his seat on the Bench,
because he always stood a t his desk—and
suffered greatly without mentioniiig it. By
his death Henry Stephen is left, as the sole
Supreme Court pensioner. Stephen is in
his .Kith year and has drawn his judicial
pension for 15 years. His father, Alfred
Stephen, lived to be 93, and had been in re-
ceipt of his pension for 21 years.

This month Thomas Alwright Dibbs will
be 86 (on the 81st), and James Reading
Fairfax will be 84 (on the 17th). Dibbs is
a Sydney native, born on the western bank
of the old Tank Stream a little north of
the General Post Office. “Mr. James,” of
S. M. Herald, was born at Leamington

of his family in childhood. He served his
time on his father’s paper, the Herald, as "a

cently, but Mr. James isn’t giving three
hearty cheers about that.
One of the latest D.S.O.’s has gone to
Lieut.-Col. J, S. Wilkinson, who already has
the M.C. He is a son of Rev. C. G. Wilkin-
son, headmaster of the Launceston Church
Grammar School (Tas.) ; a good all-round
athlete. After leaving school he joined
the Sherwood Foresters, and when war
broke out he was in British East Africa, as
a lieutenant in the King’s African Rifles.
After helping to clean up East Africa. Wil-
kinson and his men were ordered to Portu-
guese territory. They’re still fighting
there.
Admiring followers of Archbishop Duhig
are never tired of pointing to the scene of
his earliest labors—the premises of the old
Co-operative Butchering Co. in Brisbane.
Here the future R.C. dignitary attended to
his humble job as clerk, ticking off the early-
morning orders and addressing the parcels
of meat to be delivered. His advancement

Ipswich parish, where he commanded the
close attention and regard of the aged
recluse, Dr. Dunne, who promoted him to
the post of secretary in succession to Father
•T. O’Reilly. The Archbishop’s fine, legible
handwriting is due to his early scribing in
the butcher’s shop, where plain writing was
a necessity. One of The Bulletin’s
chiefest regrets is that nine-tenths of its
contributors of copy weren’t taught to write
in a raw-beef academy.
For many a long year John Russell
French, general manager of the Bank of N.
S. Wales, walked into his office with no
more than a quiet “Good morning, sir,”
from an occasional member of the staff
encountered on the way. He had one of the
surprises of bis life one day last week
when his big staff met him at the
door of the dignified banking-house and
cheered him till the coin rattled in the
vaults. This outbreak was because he had
been knighted. The unusual display of good
feeling probably gratified him more than the
cause of it.
A patriot of a sort that.ought to be
greatly encouraged is C. F. Tindal, of
Armidale (N.S.W.). In memory of two
soldier sons killed in Frgnce'he has handed
over his Trigamore estate to the State Gov-
ernment for £BOOO, which is the Land

“Mustard Gold”: Arbitration Court Judge
MeCawley, whose appeal against the decision
of the Bananaland Supreme Court has just
been dismissed by the High Court, would
hardly find Chief Justice Cooper and Judge
Real congenial bench-fellows if he should ever
sit with them, but there is a possibility of
the Privy Council supporting his appoint-
ment, seeing that the High Court turned him
clown by only a narrow majority. Both Real
and Cooper are of autocratic habits. That
McC-awley would make a good Supreme
Court Judge no one can doubt who has
observed his admirable bearing in the Arbi-
tration Court, and the success which has
attended his efforts to adjust harassing and
intricate industrial problems. He is one
more example of what a man can do who has
grit and ability. In his struggling days he
ran a night-school at Toowoomba to acquire
the funds for his legal training.
The golden jubilee of the Marists’ occu-
pancy of St. Patrick’s, Church Hill, Sydney,
occurs this year. Father McEncroe had
for some years had charge of St. Patrick’s,
and with it the Rocks area, and just prior to
his death in August, 1868, he expressed a
wish that he should be succeeded in the
parish by priests of the Order of Mary. In
1845 a couple of fathers of the Order
arrived in Sydney from Lyons to transact
business for the various missions of the
Order in the Pacific. These were Fathers
Dubruel and Rochea. With them was M.
Blanc, a lay brother. These fathers helped
the secular clergy while in Australia. On
the day of Father McEncroe’s burial, Arch-
bishop Polding gave effect to his wish and
handed over the control of St. Patrick’s to
Father Joseph Monnier, S.M.
Mrs. Yates, who conferred fame upon
Onehunga (M.L.) 25 years ago by being
elected _ its mayor, is dead. Onehunga, an
easy-going suburb of Auckland, Avas so
shocked to find itself prominently
thrust into the limelight that the
meetings of the borough council,
with Mrs. Yates in the chair, be-
came easily the most exciting
feature of public life in the North
Island in those days. When some
of the councillors and ratepayers
became disorderly at these meet-
ings, the lady mayor solved the
difficulty by sending for the police.
Mrs. Yates, during her year of
office, wiped out the municipal debt
of £BOO, spent more money than
before on roads and footpaths, and
otherwise proved herself level-
headed ; _ hut Onehunga couldn’t
stand being awake, and fired her
out at next election.
“D.”: Big-John Forrest is to be
buried in Australian soil. He
would never have rested comfort-
ably elsewhere. I remember hear-
ing him say to an American
lieutenant at the time when U.
Sam’s fleet was in Hobson’s Bay:
"Ihe prospect of being buried at sea is
appalling to me. lam certain I could never
rest far from the smell of a gum-tree.”
Norman Trenery,_ of the new War Propa-
ganda Directorate, is an insurance manager
and has been “lent” to the Government by
his eo. for six months. It was under Tren-
ery’s guidance that the recent highly-sueeess-
fub French Red Cross appeal was launched
in Melbourne. Trenery has had an unusual
career and travelled far before he finally
settled in Vic. He is a well-polished ex-
rolling-stone, and his familiarity with some
of the seats of war should help him to be
useful in his new job.
By the death in action of Sergeant Wil-
liam Love, of the A.1.P., Australia loses a
hard fighter. Backed by a long experience
under arms, Love was teaching young sol-
diers at Bendigo (Vic.) when war rent the
world. Previously he vcas a color-sergeant
m the Black Watch and possessed two
medals, gained on service with the West
African Frontier Force. James, a brother,
is in the Vic. Education Department, and a
couple of soldiers have gone from his family.
One of them, driver Colin, was killed in
h ranee a few days before his uncle fell.
Sergeant B. H. Whittle, before he en-
listed, was one of the Speck’s authorities on
the stone implements of the extinct Tas-
manian abo. _ He has one of the best collec-
tions of their chipped knives and axes, as
well as a fine lot from the other States.
Somewhere in France lie stumbled across a
few hundredweight of treason's which had
be ?u turned up by a shell—chipped and
polished flint axes and chipped spear-heads
of the Palaeolithic and Neolithic periods. He
could not pack them all away, but picked
the best and- got them safely to England.
. ®• J’: Marks, sen., who died at Ilornsby
(N.S.W.) the other day, helped to establish
and later edited the first paper west of the
Blue Mountains, the Nation, at Bathurst.
He came to Sydney 60 years ago with
printer’s ink in his system, his ancestors for
two centuries back being associated with
the Birmingham Post and other papers.
He subbed the Empire for Parkes in Sydney
and, after a term on the S. Ml Herald,'
went to Bathurst with Davy Buchanan to
■set up the Nation. The plant was carted
by bullock-teams from the coast. Later
on Marks drove his facile pen on the
Western Independent, which carried a lot
of weight at that time. The old Inkv-
fuier was 00 wlien tie .finished. Liis time.
Ogden, M H.A. (Tag.), was born
on a taim m the Geelong district over 50
years back, and served his time with his dad
to gram ancl pig culture until he was out of
his teens. _Lhen, swagging his belongings he
wandered around Australia, Shearing, drov-
f 'r 1 until he reached
Westralia, where he went to mining.
Attracted by the boom
on the Speck’s West;
Coast, he drifted there
in the early ’nineties and
scratched ore until 1906.
when he won the Zee-
han seat in the Assem-
bly. Just then the small
constituencies were
merged into the larger
electorates, and Ogden
topped the poll for Dar-
win, a performance he
has repeated at every
subsequent election. He
was Treasurer in the

ministration in 1910

Minister for Mines in

ment 1914-16.

The British Government distributes
£l2OO a year in pensions to people who have
done good work in literature, science or art,
but who have, nevertheless, fallen into strait-
ened circumstances, or to their surviving
relatives who are in the same hard case. The
late Examiner of Plays, G. A. Bedford, was
understood to be making £SOO a year at his
job, yet his widow figures in the latest list
for a pension of £5O. George Paish headed
the roster with a pension of £l5O in recogni-
tion of his services in connection with finan-
cial and economical questions relating to the
war; but since then lie has recovered his
health and has declined the allotment. He
has been for 30 years on the editorial staff
of the Statist, but since 1914 has acted as
financial adviser to Lloyd George until he
was recently prostrated by a nervous break-
down due to over-work. The widow of Pro-
fessor Tom Kettle, a leading Irish Nationalist
killed in action, gets £75 a year “in consid-
eration of the distinguished services of her
late husband in connection with literary and
economic questions.” Miss Alicia Needham,
some of whose songs have become very popu-
lar, apparently did not make a good business
bargain with the publishers. She gets £5O
a year from the State for the rest of her
life “in consideration of her work as a com-
poser ami her straitened circumstances.”
Mrs. .T. F. Barrett, widow of a once well-
known musical notability, receives a similar
pension. A Welsh poet named R. A. Hughes
gets one of £5O, and so does Mrs. Williams,
the widow of an eminent Welsh musician.
Several widows and daughters of late dis-
tinguished scientists and geologists are in-
cluded. which recalls Huxley’s tart observa-
tion : “Science does everything, except pay.”
But it paid Huxley, who was married in
Sydney, fairly well.
The new Bishop of Ballarat, Maxwell-
Gumbleton, of England, has found no rea-
son to grumble at the treatment he has
received. His arduous labors take him fre-
quently among the pure merinos of the re-
moter portions of his diocese, wherefore
Edward Manifold, of Camperdown, has come
forward to save the lowly prophet’s poor
feet by putting a motor-car into the offertory.

Mr.W. J. DEANE DECLARES CLEMENTS TONIC ALONE KEEPS HIM HEALTHY
Mr. W. ,T. DEANE is the senior member of the well-known firm of
tt. J. DEANE and SON. 177 Pitt Street, Sydney, recently removed from
500 George Street, and lias a very high opinion of Clements Tonic.
The firm of Deane and Son are well known as publishers of popular
songs, music, "theatrical sketches, operatic melodies, and as vendors of
musical instruments. They claim to be a firm who advocate the sale of
Australians Songs and assist Australian talent. Two of their chief song-
hits have been “Boys of the Dardanelles” (Marsh Little), and “There,
There, There,’' by Private Harry Cohen, who was wounded at Callipoli,
the authors being both Australians.
Mr. Deane declares this is the first testimony he has given to any
medicine, _ but the great good he has derived from Clements Tonic leads
him to give public credit to it.
CLEMENTS TONIC LTD.
l<or a period of ten years off and on I have taken your Clements Tonic, and I regard it as one of the best of nerve'
and appetite-creating medicines.
I feel J am right in saying I owe my present good state of health to its judicious use, so that others nervy in
temperament and m poor health generally may benefit as I have done. It is a magnificent remedy for all professionals
to US©#
lou may use this letter as you will for the general good. For want of sleep and loss of appetite I know of no
better medicine.
_ ( Signed)
If you cannot sleep at niglit—if you are so tired when your day’s work is done, and
can scarcely get home, take Clements Tonic. You will soon be bright and take a better
and keener interest in life. Clements Tonic and good health go hand-in-hand along the
ways of life.

“G.H.”: Grant Hervey (B. 12/9/’IS) is
correct about prisoners not being allowed to
follow their natural trade whilst in gaol.
Harris, ex-convict, who was released by
Attorney-General Hall and afterwards en-
listed and has recently been killed in France,
stabbed Quaine, the then Governor of the
Parramatta Gaol, because he felt aggrieved
over this matter. Harris was a good boot-
maker but a poor ropemaker; the con-
ditions regarding the man in the next cell
were reversed. For weeks while in the
Parramatta Gaol the convicts exchanged
tasks, and when Quaine found out he pun-
ished both men. Harris was indignant. He
PERHAPS NOT.
HE : “She is quite 'unsophisti-
cated. She even dresses
in simple print."
SHE : "Ah, yes; hut you don't
believe in everything
you see in print, do
you?"
had previously had a grudge on Quaine, who
at the time of his original arrest was in
charge at Darlinghurst, and who, according
to Harris, did not give his attorney the
necessary facilities for seeing him and thus
prepare his case, Sam McCauley, the pre-
sent Controller-General of Prisons, has por-
tion' of the knife pulled out of Quaine, the
remainder is still with Quaine, wherever he
may be.
There is one tidy citizen the fewer in
S. Aus. He was a lonely farmer of Milli-
cent, and when he decided to book for a less
troubled world he went into town, paid his
debts, made his will and announced that he
was going on a journey. Then he returned
home, packed all his belongings in cases
(with a neat note as to the contents of
each), put out food and water for the ani-
mals, and left a note on the door inviting the
neighbors to come inside when they called.
After which he laid down on his bed and said
good-night. A home-made but perfectly good
coffin was found alongside him. He had even
put on clean clothes and composed him-
self out in the orthodox position, barring an
unavoidable variation in the hand that held
the revolver. Nothing was left for the
undertaker’s man to do but to lift the oblig-
ing party’s corpse into the box and screw it
down.

The Rev. 11. B. Hewett told a St.
Paul’s (Melb.) congregation the other day
that “if sufficient people could be got
together in the world to pray the war could
not go on.” This is a phase of the efficacy
of prayer that has not previously been con-
sidered. It is certainly true that if all
people were engaged in prayer the war would
have to cease.
“Silas”: There had been trouble in the
commodious and exclusive residential man-
sion across the way. The place was losing
its excellent reputation by reason of a sys-
tematic series of small thefts from the rooms
of absent lodgers. One morning recently a
young gentleman of hitherto unimpeachable
character was seen to steal into the room
opposite his own, and was caught by a
couple of housemaids in the act of searching
boxes. An investigation as a preliminary
to calling in the police followed, and accused
insisted loudly and urgently on the innocence
of his intentions. “As a matter of fact,” he
said, “I was only going to borrow Smith’s
razor.” “But you had already shaved.”
Smith insisted; “and, in any case, your own
razor is much better than mine.” “Yes,
that’s it,” admitted defendant dolefully. “I
wanted to trim my corns!”
* * * *
“Y.A.K.”: I think “G.A.” (B. 26/9/’.lS>
is off the track when he indirectly attributes
the “tank” to engineer Burrell’s front name.
The British Ministry of Munitions, when
initiating the new weapon, wished to pre-
serve the closest secrecy, and the term
“tank” suggested itself. In all correspond-
ence between the M.O.M. and the manufac-
turers, both of the completed tank and com-
ponent parts, the reference was to tanks, and
any unauthorised individual of an inquiring
turn of mind was at liberty to surmise what
he liked. Certainly the secret was well kept.

“Melb”: Generalissimo Hay, Salvation
Army, notifies that he has bought a Spring-
street location, near the Burke and Wills
monument, to build a Home for Business
Girls. Hay is the best organiser the Army
ever had here, though all its
previous chiefs —Barker, How-
ard, Coombs, H. Booth and
McKie —were able. Hay found
the concern, a nuihber of years
ago, only marking time. People
said the big drum was on the
wane, but Hay made it boom
again, opening a host of small
new barracks and getting finan-
cial profit out of the business
ventures such as lodging-houses.
As for the spiritual—well. I
don’t know. Joe Symes said,
acidly: “Wesley saved souls.
Fitchett saves money.” Hay’s
doing it too —but not for him-
self. His salary is only £3 JOs,
a week, while he is as efficient
as Archbishop Clarke at £4O, or
Primate Wright at £44.

How would this/be for a test?
It being the fashion among our

sort of fellow and fit to be nego-
tiated with like anybody else,
let a rigid inquiry be made
among returned prisoners.

“Bill Bowyang”: Billjim has travelled
into some queer corners of this planet since
1014. and one of the out-of-the-way places
where he has patrolled is on the site of King
Solomon’s mines. Prior to the war it was
thought that Solomon secured his gold from
Arabia, but the Ophir of the Bible has now
been identified with the Eastern desert of
Egypt. Ancient gold workings are still to
be ' seen here. Ophir cannot be identified
with Arabia, since there is no gold there. It
has been argued that the Hebrews would have
found difficulties in carrying on mining
operations unmolested in Egyptian territory,
but it may be contended on the other hand
DUTCH COURAGE.
CIVILIAN : “I would like to go, hut I can hardly sec my way clear.”
THE WARRIOR: “Well, get more glasses.”
that Solomon may have made some bargain
with the Pharaoh, as, for example, that the
former' might mine in a certain tract of
country if the latter might cut timber in the
Lebanon. The most common view is that
Solomon obtained his gold from the land of
Fount, so often referred to in Egyptian in-
scriptions.

An Australian Light Horseman, back from
the Holy Land, put it to The Bulletin this
way: “I have seen something of dirty people
in the last twelve months—people who make
a hobby of sheer dirtiness —but Egypt pro-
duces the champions. I give you my word,
the natives there know by the whiff of a
man what district lie comes from.”

The recently-constructed Adelaide tram-
line, Keswick to Adelaide, is likely to knock
out the last of the ’buses in the city. Reid,
proprietor of livery stables, has been relating
how penny sections were brought about in
Adelaide. Threepence minimum was the
charge on the old horse cars, and the bloated
capitalists who owned them would not hear
of any reduction. Reid was then approached,
and he decided to give ’buses a trial. He
went to Sydney and purchased 25 vehicles
called “Try Agains.” Sydney was scrapping
them at the time, and they were secured at
prices ranging from £5 to £l5. He then
bought about 100 horses, and got busy. With
trips two or three miles for a Id. he cut the
horse-tram receipts to the bone. After nine
months Reid was asked his price to sell out.
He said £lBOO, and got it; but regrets that
he made such a big mistake, as he now says
he could have got £lB,OOO. Penny sections
of two miles can be made to pay well, in
Reid’s opinion. This is much better than
the Adelaide Tramways Trust can manage.
It wants lid. for mile sections.

N. S. Wales Health Inspectors’ Congress
sniffed something gruesome when Kench,
Chief Food Inspector of the Health Depart-
ment, unpacked a wallet of condemned food-
stuffs seized from Sydney and suburban
shops and hasli-pagodas. Mouldy prunes,
figs and dates, putrid cheese, “blown” tinned
fish and meats and filthy ice-cream and milk
receptacles were some of the exhibits. Some
of the worst rubbish sold in Sydney de-
clared the inspector, is marked “Guaranteed
under the Pure Foods Act!”
“G.L.1.”: A group of Australian camel-
men were surprised by a taube while wait-
ing to attack at Beerslieba. Instantly every
man had jumped to the groud and scrambled
under his camel’s belly. Down came the
bombs. One landed squarely, burying the
man underneath a shapeless welter of what
had a second before been a camel. The
man himself was unhurt. An hour later
I saw a bomb drop almost underneath a
mounted camelman. The beast was blown
to pulp and the man dashed to the ground
30 yards away, but, except for being a
blithering idiot for a couple of hours ho
was unhurt. Saw a camel-man scout
had put up a great fight for life one day.
His corpse was lying behind his mount, his
rifle still clenched in his hands, sighted over
the camel’s back. There were 4!) bullet-holes in
the carcase. The man had one bullet-hole,
clean through the heart. Beside him lay a
little pile of SO empty cartridge cases, mute
testimony of a fight to the bitter end.

For some months past cable messages have
been received in Australia referring to
stopping the sale of alcool in France, and
this word has been interpreted as alcohol and
applied to all intoxicating liquors. In
France alcool is the name given to spirit
derived from potatoes, beet or cider, and it
is not allowed to be stored in any pure
grape-brandy distillery; also brandy enter-
ing an alcool store loses its identity and
must be sold as alcool. It is now the in-
tention of the French Government to sup-
press the sale of alcool altogether, to defeat
unscrupulous traders blending with pure grape
brandy. Some enthusiasts have concluded
that the Temperance party of France had
persuaded the Government to bring in pro-
hibition, but as a matter of fact absinthe
and alcool are the only spirits banned so
far, and these at the suggestion of the dis-
tillers themselves.

WAR NEWS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The exiled Servians are going home
Across their native ranges with a knife—
Oh, happy wind that blows the curling foam,
The airs are joyous with the scent of life!
Somehow the war news helps to gild the day
From Darling Harbor down to Watson’s Bay.
The bag of Turks increases every hour.
On far Damascus roads our troopers ride—
Mark how the sandstone ridges break in flower
And Spring walks delicately as a bride.
It’s good to be alive, to feel the sun
And know the war will certainly be won.
The German trembles to the new assault.
His boasting stilled, his courage ebbing low—
Oh, girl, it is the merry springtime’s fault!
I must have one more kiss before I go.
The sounds of moving victory are great;
Put up your lips that we may celebrate!

Key Action.
The he ale Piano Aclion-
cl iew its superior £ecrttires
1. The whole of the Beale Piano action is
manufactured from a special kind of timber
which does not split, warp or crack. It is
exceedingly tough and the various parts can be
brought down to the light weight necessary for
a light touch, without sacrificing any of that
strength which durability demands.
2. The hammers, dampers and all other felt
pieces used in the Beale Piano are made from
pure, Australian Merino Wool of the finest
grade. Such wool will remain “live” for the
greatest number of years, giving a quality of
tone that is appreciated by the true music lover.
3. Every piano-action mechanic knows the
superiority of the front escapement, double-
repetition type of action, such as is found in
our instrument. This is the, most responsive,
sympathetic and utterly reliable action known
to piano builders. It guarantees a “touch”
that delights the technically proficient musician.
4. A Beale key, made of genuine spruce, from
a built-up piece of timber; the strongest
possible construction. Ivory is the pure, white,
fine grained East African and Egyptian variety.
The yellow West African and Indian ivory is
never used.
When you decide to have a good piano, investigate the Beale. Terms if desired.

ARTHUR J. USHER,
Managing Director.
A glance at the particulars of the world’s
wireless stations in the official Berne lists
prior to the war show that the Huns had
two stations in the Pacific—one at Yap in
the Caroline group, the other at Nauru,
Marshall Islands —both owned and operated
by the German Superphosphate Co. Appar-
ently these were quite small affairs, good
for about 300 miles using 600 metres, but
actually the fine plants were erected to inter-
communicate, which they did with ease
though over 2000 miles apart. No mention
is made of any station at Rabaul, though
the Australians found one there on arrival.
Early in 1914 the Commonwealth Post
Office arranged with the Melbourne end of
the G.S.C. to institute a Wireless service
with Nauru, via Yap and Thursday Island,
and ordinary traffic was accepted in Mel-
bourne. All went well till evidently Berlin
got to hear about it, and traffic was refused
with the intimation: “Yap says he has
cabled instructions not to work with Aus-
tralia any more.”

The strike on the transcontinental rail-
way, because the management refused a free
pass for six or eight weeks to a union
organiser, with the rather foreign-sounding
name of Wittorf, was blackmail pure and
simple. It has never been the prac-
tice on any State railways except those
of Westralia to issue such passes, and
it has never been the practice on the
Federal railways. Also it isn’t in the
regulations. Tne amount involved wasn’t
much —the strikers would lose far more
in a half-day’s stoppage; but by mak-
ing a petty new demand and then hanging
up the country’s biggest railway they had,
or thought they had, the satisfaction of ex-
hibiting their power. The position of the
management was just that of any man
when an individual demands grovel or a shil-
ling with threats. The grovel and the
shilling may be cheap enough, but they are
offensive, and the surrender may lead to a
demand for more grovel and £lO. The

bill is entirely paid out of taxes and part of
the working expenses as well, so the em-
ployees get about £220,000 a year more
than the net result of their services. And
when they hang up the work because they
aren’t allowed to bunco the country out of a
few pounds more that aren’t in the contract,
there is a feeling that it is of little use mak-
ing bargains with them.

“Sarg”: Two Light Horsemen were
reclined under the scant, sweltering shelter
afforded by a diekily-'erected bivouac sheet,
exhausting their energies in analysing their
stiff luck. They were supposed to be on
patrol. Bill reckoned the game was well
up to mud, as the rations seemed to grow less
as the days went by, the cigarette issue was
“pussy” and he’d only seen advts about beer.
Jim sympathised by remarking that the sun
was hot as Hell, and he’d like to know why
he was always picked on for this ruddy job;
moreover, he was sure Jacko could see them,
and it was only a matter of time till a
whiz-bang would knock them, and it was
too blessed hot to shift the bivvy where 1 it
wouldn’t be seen. Together they wondered
what the Heads could see in fighting for
such a rotten, crook joint when nobody
would have the blanked place at a gift. And
where the Sheol was Tom, who knew flamin’
well that it was his turn to boil the billy.
The high, sinister whistle of a light shell
overhead checked their conversation. “Told
you so,” said Jim, gloomily. “Nex’ one ’ll
bo closer,” Bill commented wearily. It was ;
it landed amongst their saddlery and scat-
tered it to the winds. The priceless con-
tents of their wallets went with it and the
shelter prostrated itself upon the pair.
Abdul was satisfied and knocked off. Bill
remarked, disgustedly, that it took the bis-
cuit. Jim agreed that it was; also, that it
had taken the only tin of bully. If ever
there was a stiffer lot of poor cows, he’d
like to know! Diversion came in the
shape of Tom, who complained that a pair
of blighters like them weren’t fit to mind
babies let alone a bloke’s saddle and gear,
and he’d a scarlet good mind not to give
them any. “Any” was a couple of fat
grouse that had, he explained, been stunned
by the first Jacko shell. Bill and Jim decided
that, perhaps, a bloke didn’t get too bad a
spin when all was said and done.
“Syd Ney”: As is well known, Billjim
has a deeply rooted objection to saluting
even his own officers except when he can t
very well avoid it. One day an Australian
officer was walking along an English lane
when he met a digger strolling the other way
with his hand in
his pocket. As he
approached the offi-
cer, Billjim pulled
his hand from its
resting place to
straighten the col-
lar of his tunic.
Mistaking the ac-
tion for the prelude
to a salute the offi-
cer half-returned
the courtesy. By
that time Billjim’s
hand was back in
his pocket and the
o ffi c e r’s arm
stopped half-way
up. The other, see-
ing the movement,
withdrew his hand
hastily and also
half saluted and
stopped. By this
time they' were
opposite each other
and both halted and
grinned. What fol-
lowed was typical
of the Australian
officer. “Well,” he
said, “if we’re going
to do the thing,
let’s get it done
properly.” And
turning about they
retraced their steps
and marched past
each other smartly,
giving and return-
ing a correct mili-
tary salute. Then, without exchanging
another word, each passed on his way to the
presbytery.
“Mustard Gold” : The commercial traveller
is not what he used to be on the Westralian
goldfields, nor do you see many of the old
hands humping the satchel through the
mulga. In the . boom times the bagman
floated through with almost unlimited ex-
penses at his disposal, a prosperous, breezy
personage whose arrival in the wayback
towns was an event washed down with copi-
ous booze. These days the “house” sends
out prim, ultra-respectable youths fresh from
the packing-room, with no surplus money to
spend, who call deferentially on the local
retailer, take his order, buy him a drink, and
unostentatiously vanish to the next village.
Only two members of the ancient brigade
catch the eye nowadays, and they have been
doing the tracks for 20 years. There was
one senior to them who pulled off in protest
against the high-collared interlopers of the
present brood of drummers, to whom lie
refused to give professional status. “If they
are commercial travellers,” he exclaimed dis-
gustedly. “then I am an ambassador of com-
merce.” However, in his fresh days he inno-
cently booked an order for the supply of
“two dozen wooden-bottomed frying-pans,"
put in on him by a sardonic bush grocer, t<>
which the firm replied by wire, “Are you
drunk? Return Perth at once.” There
was big money working the Backblocks on
commission (and salary) in the boom times
and for many years later. One brewery
traveller touched £BOOO for one year’s com-
mission on beer. An order for 50 tons (250
barrels), given by a Sandstone publican, and
conveyed to him by camel-team from the
Leonora railway terminus, tops the record of
a thirsty period.

From Palestine: —
Two Turkish ’planes came over; very high, as
usual. Our fellows had been waiting for them.
Suddenly the whole circus appeared in the open,
circling and diving at one another to the accompani-
ment of the muffled patter of the guns. Then one
machine sailed away from the rest, coming down all
the time. It had a queer look about it, something
that puzzled us. Then it dawned on us —it was on
fire. It sailed lazily, a big bronze rocket, an ever-
increasing tail of flame and smoke streaming out
behind. We watched it, fascinated. Suddenly a
great cloud of flame and black smoke shot up, and
in a few seconds something left the ’plane and fell
swiftly. We knew it for a man. The burning ’plane
fell faster and faster till it finally vanished behind
the trees. They talk of the horror and hopelessness
of a fire at sea, but I’ve seen something worse.

Serbia intends having a celebration when
the Hun and his friends are got rid of.
It is proposed, first, that a baby shall be
born, the birth-rate having entirely ceased
in the afflicted land for a long while. Then
an effort will be made to trace the thousands
of children whom the Hun allies sent as
slaves to Turkey. Also, burial will be given
to those of the dead, numbering a quarter of
the nation, who are still above ground.
Finally, some inquiry will be made - about
an indemnity—not a “penal” one, of course,
it being an axiom of the pacifists that no

non-combatants, the exploitation of children

Oh, come eve Matron Summer cuts out Spring,
Spring with her pouting lips and hazel eyes,
Green with the greenness ot' each woodland thing.
Will you not come before the months more wise
Set up housekeeping in each stream and bough,
And all the ardor of the mating dies?
Each roving bird flings out this season’s vow,
And each bud’s trousseau yet is in the making;
But Mistress Spring soon makes her exit bow,
Whose fingers springing to its lone awaking
My heart that slept so deep this Winter past—-
My words laugh, but my heart is near to breaking.
Oh, come, the Spring is born and grown so fast,
Her mouth’s a wild rose and her eyes are hazel ;
But, ah, her youth’s a flower that will not last 1

Goodyear Conveyor Belting
Does Better Work, at a Lower Cost.
The headline will bear repetition because it states a fact on which
the great Goodyear belting business is being built, here as elsewhere.
Goodyear Conveyor Belting does better work., at a lower tonnage cost.
In places where water and grit shorten the life .of belts—there you
will find Goodyear Belting giving the best conveyor service ever
known —and at the lowest cost.
Goodyear Conveyors do not stretch under constant strain; ply separa-
tion is almost unheard of.
There is an extra-thick, extra-tough outer cushion, to resist the wear
of the load; and patent cushion edges to protect the belt from
abrasion and ply separation.
For flat conveying, for tripper conveying, for bucket conveying, you
will find Goodyear Conveyor Belts will give the greatest tonnage and
continuous service at the lowest possible cost.

POLITICAL
POINTS
Ex-Premier Joseph Carruthers, M.L.C.,
N. S. Wales, definitely chucked away the
false pretence of being an anti-loan person
with which he bought his way to office in
1904, and declared himself the other day in
favor of “huge borrowing.” It was neces-
sary, said Carruthers, if the country is to
“pull through the serious times ahead.”
Well, if the Ma State, whose politicians have
bragged with sickening iteration about its
boundless resources, is in that condition after
borrowing nearly £150,000,000 already, it
is almost without exception the most abject
place on earth. Places like Belgium, Ser-
bia, Montenegro, Ron mania and Northern
France might want to borrow. They put every
available man in the lighting line to do it.
Their industries were destroyed; their coun-
try looted of every coin and portable article
of value that the enemy could find; and
their women and children put to forced
labor without pay. They want loans or
assistance of some sort to rebuild their ruins.
Britain, the U.S., Canada, the ffuinvaded
sections of France and Italy call for con-
sideration because they called up their man-
hood for military service remorselessly;
also France, Britain and the U.S., in the
midst of their own efforts, found money to
lend to poorer allies. • Australia, which
escaped all these troubles, should be a
lender now, and a liberal one, not a bor-
rower. Some of its worm-like politicians
are quite capable of asking the battered
remnants of the Serbian nation, now trek-
king back to their home ashes, if they have
a trifle left among their rags with which
to take up a N. S. Wales bond, so as to
help the richest State of the continent. But.
surely the community isn’t one big worm !
According to a new Federal regulation
(No. 2116394|8) no financial institution is
to offer more than 41 per cent, for money
until further notice. This will tend to divert
money to the War Loan, which is a good and
fieriest idea. It will also tend to divert
money towards the loan expenditure on the
hopelessly-unpayable Canberra capital, which
has amounted to about £900,000 since the
war started ; and towards the palace in Lon-
don, wherein Andrew Fisher looks like a
mote in a cathedral; and towards Watt’s
proposal to charge to loans money for light-
houses and land resumptions for purely peace
purposes. And it will help the six State
Treasurers to find money for their six
separate loan policies. These schemes come
in by the side door —the one at which the
fifth-rate publican does his Sunday trade.
It is proposed to appoint a committee of
three gentlemen to act as honorary financial
advisers to the N. S. Wales Government.
Well, all that seems necessary to say, par-
ticularly after considering the report of the
Auditor-General about the Norton Griffiths
contracts, is that the best thing these hon-
orary gentlemen can advise is that the Gov-
ernment should hang itself on a nice, tall
gallows, where the ventilation is good and
there is a fine view of the scenery.
Iu Melbourne they are calling the Watt
Ministry {pro tern.) the Taxi-Cabinet.
From the Gallery :
Last week the Reps, enjoyed the spectacle of
Catts explaining the famous Perth resolution on
recruiting, with his Labor brethren sniping fiercely
behind. C'atts’s attempt to give a patriotic inter-
pretation to what transpired was impaired by a
voice lacking, in conviction, a manner wanting in
emphasis, and a spirit of anxiety anent the plain
meaning of the words. It was painful to watch
the floundering man take up the phrase, “participa-
tion in recruiting,” and examine it closely with the
aid of a large dictionary. “Participation in recruit-
ing,” as jointly divined by Catts and Webster, meant
exactly what it said, and Catts was very bitter at
the suggestion that the phrase, taken in conjunction
with the subsequent qualifications, indicated any
visible slackening in Labor's attitude since 1914.
Catts’s precious indignation was lost as much on
his friends as on his opponents, and the readiness of
Charlton, Page and other moderates to dissociate
themselves from his opinions and beliefs showed that
the peace negotiators in the Australian Parliament
are a negligible quantity. But the curious feature
of Catts’s oration was its disturbance to the serenity
of Mr. Considine. He found enough in the speech to
make him turn pink, and in one interval he squealed
in a way that was more pointed than polite.
The Norton Griffiths scheme was not alone
in N. S. AVales in its dreadful waste of pub-
lic money. Another example is the State
Fish Chilling and Ice Making Works on
Waudandian Creek, 20 miles south of
Nowra. These works have been constructed
for years, but work has never yet been
started. If Private Enterprise is better, why
not sell or let to someone who will establish
a local industry? Incidentally, the South
Coast railway line is a glaring example of
the price of Sydney centralisation. In ISB4
Parliament voted money to build a railway
to Jervis Bay, part of which was built as far
as Bomaderry, but in 1902 the unexpended
balance was wiped off the slate, leaving a
gap of 18 miles short of a magnificent har-
bor which was the nominal reason for the
construction of the line.
A pathetic sight in the Reps, is the unex-
ampled rancor of the ancient Archibald
against his former associates. He j-arely
gets on his feet without opening the flood-
gates of his opprobrium for the unappreciated
benefit of the opposing benches. He tells
them what their greatest enemy would like to
know in a voice that is never near compo-
sure. He informs them of the tyranny
which they represent, and protests against
the Trades Hall domination which was so
disgusting to his liberty-loving soul that he
tolerated it for years in S. Australia. In
the old Labor party Archibald was a com-
paratively considerable person, but in the
present multitude of Nationalists he is
almost negligible enough to be a neuter, and,
in addition, suffers his extinction in a caucus
that is quite as arbitrary as the one he used
to know.
A REASONABLE EXCUSE.
“The red flag may now only be used as. a danger
signal or warning to traffic.”
FIRST RED RAGGER ( scornfully ): “What,
workin ’?”
SECOND DO: “Yes; I don’t consider any
sacrifice too great to keep the red flag
flying."
Championing the cause of the liquor party,
Thomas Duff captured the Claremont
(W.A.) seat the other day against the pro-
hibitionists, two of whom forfeited their
deposits. Ever since 1890, when he landed
on the Westralian goldfields, and subse-
quently followed hard on the heels of Paddy
Hannan at the discovery ot Kalgoorlie.
Duff has been more, or less on the screen.
He was. later, a hotelkeeper at the rising
wheat centre of Merredin. He made a heap
of monev out of mining shares, which pro-

The Prisoners’ Detention (Amendment)
Bill had an easy passage through N. 8.
Wales Leg. Council last week. I nder the
original Act persons sentenced to gaol and
found to be suffering from venereal diseases
A FATAL OBSTACLE.
“The'action of the Federal Cabinet in setting up
a special Board to consider problems in regard to
Australian production and the future development of
her agriculture, does not meet with the approval of
the N. S. Wales Premier.” — News item.
Holman: “Really, it isn’t right, y’ know.
You see, you don’t live in Sydney."
were detained until cured, whether their
“time” had expired before the cure or not.
During the two years between September,
1916, and August, 1918, 212 patients were
treated under this law. Now it has been
widened to net persons who get gaoled, not
by direct sentences, but by default in pay-
ment of fines. In the aforementioned two
years 121 such internees were diseased, but
had to be released when their fines were paid
with their horror rank upon them.
Under N. S. Wales’s latest Arbitration
Act strikes are absolutely illegal, unless
a union declares, by secret ballot, that it
wants to strike. A small party which has
gathered its force in advance may surprise a
small meeting and carry its strike resolution
by a big majority, and the real majority,
which wasn’t present, may go with what it
thinks is the crowd but which is nothing of
the sort. The peaceful ballot tends to under-
mine the authority of the roaring “boss,”
and the “boss” is consequently against it. So
the very first time the new law was tried-
over a trouble at Metters’s factory, Alexan-
dria—the strike was rushed a day ahead of
the ballot. There might be a majority
against it, but the Direct Action leaders have
no use for a majority. Their contempt for
the voice of the people is akin to that of
Louis XIV.
The Australian Government threatens to
erect 100 cottages to b.egin with at Litligow
and to let them at a rental equal to 8 per cent,
per annum. Now, the Federal Government
can make sure of tenants simply by keeping
its Litligow arms-factory going. It can even
make sure of active competition among
tenants. It can protect itself against bad
debts by deducting the rent from its em-
ployee’s wages. Yet it seems to think it
necessary to charge the same rate which is
usually allowed to the private landlord who
may be scuffling for tenants in one of the
many dying towns, and who must take his
chance of bad debts, and who has to raise
what money he requires on his own credit,
not being able to float a compulsory loan at
5 per cent. This situation helps to explain
why the private landlord doesn’t build cot-
tages for renting purposes these days, though
he does an occasional flutter in flats. He
may be described as the baffled villain of the
melodrama.
It looks curious, but it isn’t, that the
Australian Government, with £27.613,000
on hand at the close of the financial year
and £13,000,000 of the last war loan to
come in—over £40,000,000 in all—should
owe Britain £38,000,000 for paying our sol-
diers. The fact is that the Budget should
be in two compartments, gold and paper,
after the fashion of some countries which
have been longer at the game than we, so
as to show how much of the money is good
to meet all sorts of liabilities, and how much
is g iod for local liabilities only.
■‘Edo”: Westralia’s disappointed politi-
cian, Jimmy Mitchell, recently moved a vote
of censure in Westralian Assembly against
Premier Lefroy and his crowd. When Jimmy
started he had before him acres of good
ammunition to fire away. He could have
asked a hundred or so questions about
broken promises and the wasting of money,
all of which could have been loaded into the
one big question: Why is there a deficit of
£3,000,000, when it was promised that by
emptying Scaddan out of office economy
would follow. But Mitchell
made his attack on the subject
of repatriation. Even now it
is a fairly good subject, if
properly handled, but Mitchell
was clumsy. Lefroy thought it
his duty to settle returned sol-
diers on virgin soil. Mitchell’s
grievance was, or is, that the
damaged warriors were not
asked to go on improved repur-
chased farms. But the West-
ralian farmer is largely an
artificial product. Thousands
of him are practically paid to
hold on, and at the hour Lefroy
lias over 7000 improved farms
on hand. Perth is crowded with
“large landholders” Who are
working in shops or banks or
Government offices, or looking
for jobs. Even while Mitchell
was talking in the House an
advertisement was in Ivalgoorlie
Miner wailing for help for set-
tlers at Denmark, “the garden
of Westralia.” At the same
time, too, Commonwealth rail-
way officials were at Kalgoorlie
to find out how much perishable
stuff was needed per train from
the eastern States to keep the
goldfields from starvation. llow-
ever that didn’t matter, because the trains
have gone on strike.
Willie Kelly, seems to have landed
an armor-piercing shell in the vitals of the
Navy Department, which, he says, “has re-
duced correspondence to the most inexact
science in the world.” According to Kelly
the navy sold the gunboat, Albert to a specu-
lator who afterwards sold the ship’s boiler
for more than he gave for the whole vessel.
Not only that, but he sold it. to a
Government Department! Willie says he
opened fire by correspondence on August 1,
and the N.D. had not fired a single type-
writer in reply at the beginning of October.
Meanwhile, First Lord .Tocook is studying
tactics or something in England, and his De-
partment’s “contingencies’.’ are set down at
£142,285.
The N. S. Wales Government loses few
chances of charging things to loans. Among
the permanent and reproductive works for
1918-1919 (there arc £8,725,100 worth of
them) appear purchase of sheep for returned
soldiers, £50,000 ; ditto cows, £2000; doing
sQmething to the Wagonga River, £4500;
bridges, £0700; improvements to the
Treasury Building (or Shortage Building).
£13.100 ; draining a swamp, £1300; agricul-
tural colleges, £0000; advances to farmers for
fallowing land, £80.000; shallow boring,
£17,000; tourist resorts, £l.OOO, and so on.
If the Government goes on charging things to
loans like this if may yet be short of subjects
to spend ordinary income on, and may have
to advertise for board and lodging for a
homeless revenue.
A Minister for Prolonged Absence would
lie a welcome addition to some State Cab-
inets. The portfolio would be, passed round,
being always held by the Minister who was
drawing globe-trotting expenses in return for
reporting on the alleged prevalence of niggers
in Africa, and the reason of it, and the
remedy, if any.
NEW KINGS FOR OLD.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“A time of surprising political changes must fol-
low the war.”— English paper.
Let us be ready for change,
For things unseen before;
There's a new world and strange
Ringing the bell at the door.
New coats and hats for all
The policies that must come
When the thrones of the despots fall
At the last thud of the drum !
Shibboleths die on. the mouth.
The old dangers are gone ;
And the lands from north to south
Must he getting a new stride on.
Parties and plans shall fail
For new parties and schemes;
And the mouldy things and stale
Must yield to the newer dreams.
When the war ghosts are laid
Begins the Great Push ;
The game of men must be played
In the towns and the plain and the bush.
The little kingships die,
But each man stands, as a k ing
Under a clear sky
Fronting the new thing.

RHEUMATISM, LUMBAGO and SCIATICA are three of the most common and painful complaints, and are
especially prevalent in cold districts. They practically arise from the same cause, and the names only distinguish
the location of the disease. If the arms and legs are affected it is called Rheumatism ; if the loins, Lumbago ;
and if the hips, Sciatica. The attacks are generally brought on by chills when the body is overheated, or by
exposure to damp or cold draughts, which act not upon the bones or muscles but upon the Uric Acid in the Blood, which is
the cause of the disease. Uric Acid is found in small quantities in many articles of diet, which, when consumed, pass into
the blood. The failure of the Liver and Kidneys to filter and absorb this acid leads to an accumulation in the system, tends
to clog the circulation, and hardens the tissues forming the blood-vessels. Thus every movement of the affected parts causes
you intense agony. The pains are affected more or less by cold or heat. A damp day will double you up, or the warmth of
the bed will intensify the suffering. Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills have been wonderfully successful, not only by
affording permanent relief, but by restoring the joints to their original suppleness.
THEY STAND THE TEST.
“I can assert,” writes Mrs. Annie Andrew, Broome Street, North
Fremantle, W.A., “that Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills are an excellent
remedy for relief from rheumatics. I suffered with this complaint and
found more benefit from your medicine than others. I frequently speak of
this remedy to my friends and acquaintances. I am a resident of three
years here. I cannot sneak too highly of a genuine medicine after a good
test, at least that has been my experience with Dr. Morse’s Indian Root
Pills. You may use this testimony for publication.”
WONDERFUL RELIEF.
“I was a great martyr to rheumatics in Longreach, Queensland, and at
times could not move from my bed,” writes Mrs. Adelaide Fry, 33 Victoria
Street, Parkside, Adelaide, S.A. “My mother was a great believer in Dr.
Morse’s Indian Root Pills, and through her instrumentality I took your
remedy and found them relieve my suffering always. I now take them
occasionally, and my state of health is usually very good.”
Those who suffer from Rheumatism, Sciatica,
Lumbago or Neuralgia will find Dr. Morse s
Indian Root Pills very successful. Much imme=
diate relief, however, may be obtained by the use
of COnSTOCK’S NERVE AND BONE LINIfIENT,
in conjunction with the pills. This liniment has
been thoroughly tested, and will be found
invaluable in all cases of Nerve, Bone and
Muscle Pains.
COnSTOCK’S NERVE AND BONE LINIMENT
is sold by all leading Chemists and Storekeepers,
or will be posted free, price 2/6 per bottle, six
bottles for 13/6, by the W. H. Comstock Co. Ltd.,
23 Lang Street, Church Hill, Sydney ; and Farish

•‘Ela”: The keeping of carpet-snakes as
an eradicator of rats used to be a common habit in
North Queensland in, olden days. One vice-regal
reptile used to twine himself around the ridge-pole
of Government House, Port Moresby (Papua), in
the days when William Macgregor w T as the
Cocked Hat. The carpet was Mac's great joke when-
ever he had guests in the ramshackle old bungalow,
now replaced by a palatial residence, and he per-
sonally attended to it being hung in the room
occupied by the celebrity whose nerves he wished
to test. History has it that a Grand Duke of Austria,
who meandered around the Solomons and New Guinea
in the 'nineties (looking for suitable jumping-off
places to attack Australia from, I suppose), turned
into bed one night, inked to the eyes by his
host’s Hielan’ dew, and discovered the reptile
coiled artistically around the head-rail. Inter-
national complications were averted by the courageous
actions of old Mat Moreton, then private secretary,
who rushed to the alien’s help and grabbed the pet
while the scion of the Hapsburgs hid himself under
the blankets. Mat said afterwards he narrowly
escaped being made , a member of the Order of the
Golden Washbowl by the grateful drunk, who thought
iie had 'em again. On another occasion when the
officers of an Italian warship were being fed and
wined by Macgregor, and the usual platitudes were
being strewn around, the carpet, precipitating himself
after a rat on a rafter, dropped into the plate of a
portly commander. The subsequent proceedings
resembled a riot; chairs went over, and half a
score of excited Italians stampeded from the
room. Mac tried to explain that the in-
truder was a household pet. Said an Italian
officer: “We know your Excellency is a great zoolo-
gist, but as we are plain sailor men we care not
for the opportunity to gaze on the serpent at so
close range.” The intruder was bagged by a grin-
ning house-boy, and the dinner continued.

"Keith Iv.” : I am going to take a patent
out for this recipe, it was at Ingham (N.Q.), and
I was discussing a coming corroboree with black
Micky. “My word,” he said, “big feller corroboree
to-night. Good singer come from Stone River; he
train on frogs.” 1 collected the following hint for
Melba from Micky. The blacks catch a small brown
frog and keep it in a billy of water until the liquid
gets pea-soupy. Abo. Caruso drinks this, and then
eats the frog. His voice is then guaranteed to be
“plenty strong and not tired.”
“D.F.”: There is an early reference to
damper in a book about -N. S. Wales published in Lon-
don in 1843 and written by a Scot from Berwickshire,
named John Hood, who spent some time at Connobolas,
near Boree, in 1841 and 1842. He observes that he had
heard so much about “damper” that the word was
associated in his mind with something like the black
bread of Russia or the pine bread of Sweden. Then
he hands out this testimonial: “I am glad to say,
however, that it is the very best bread I ever ate.”
According to Hood everyone in the bush in those
days drank “green” tea. lit Canada or U.S.A. you
may still be asked whether you will drink black tea
or green, but does anyone ever take green tea in
Australia nowadays'?
* * * *
“N.C.”: Recently in Nelson (M.L.), while
blasting operations were in progress, two frogs
were discovered in the centre of a rock that
had split open. The frogs seemed dead when
first inspected, but after a time they began to
breathe. Geologists who have examined the rock
from which they came estimate its age • to be
about 3000 years. The Museum authorities for-
warded one of the frogs to Sydney for examination.
I saw it on board the boat coming across, and it
was able to hop about, but was quite blind and did
not eat.
NOTHING LEFT.
"There hasn't been a burglar in our district for years.”
"Eh! Ha ve you 'policemen there?”
"No. Nothing blit patriotic collections.”
“McTrochjas”: The guileless children
of nature who inhabit Kaiser Bill’s lost slice of
New Guinea ardently love a hat, more especially a
belltopper. Meandering along the beach of the
Huon Gulf I met brown brother on his
way to church, clad in a startling colored lava-
lava (loin-cloth), once-white singlet, blood-red hibis-
cus flowers stuck jauntily in his hanging ear-lobes,
and ; an ancient stovepipe lid richly ornamented with
vermilion stars and crescents, pliis a gorgeous rag-
giana (bird of paradise) plume. A few clock-wheels
and a piece of white shell hung from his nose. His
missus plodded along behind the boss. A
child’s blouse of green and yellow calico, much
trimmed with scarlet insertion, and a string of blue
and white beads. covered her upper half, and a blue
lava-lava faced with red braid, belted to her waist
with a wide leather strap fastened with a huge
brass buckle, on which “Gott Mit Uns” proclaimed
its Hunnish ancestry, completed her costume. Hats
of various sorts adorned other pious gentlemen—only
a hat, in many instances, over a veneer of grime and
cocoa nut-oil. Others in the party were trimmed with
colored feathers and painted in red, green and blue
designs. The village headman strutted along in
silent dignity, a tall silver-topped ebony staff in
his hand, a fireman’s can with a broad band of
scarlet braid around the brim precariously balanced
on his woolly head, and a cast-off lava-lava from
the British police uniform around his waist. At a
respectful distance behind him came his satellite, the
village policeman, his cap distinguished from his
master’s by two narrow bands of scarlet braid. He
was proudly wearing a pair of small boy’s trousers
that fitted him, like a glove, so that he appeared to
have been poured into them. An urchin of about
10 was wearing a lady's chip-hat trimmed with a
wreath of very dirty imitation cornflowers. The-
beach was bright with the colors of the giggling
brown maidens' lava-lavas, as they trooped : along
giving the glad eye to the adoring village knuts,
who were idling under the shade of the c9coam.lt
palms," swapping experiences and consuming un-
limited betel-nut. No for these young
blades. The clatter of a bullock-bell called
the faithful to worship in a tin-roofed fur-
nace under the palms. A most successful but
now old and retired murderer hobbled along the
beach on his wjSy to perform his deaconieah office
in the tabernacle. The black cloth coat and trousers
of righteousness ami a superannuated parson’s hat
clothed his withered frame. For the rig-out the old
gentleman and. his children had to pay much copra to
the hard-nosed missionary who formerly owned the
garments. A puff ofj wind from the sea—the south-
east breeze just beginning to crinkle the shimmering
blue-satin plain—-lifts the old man’s hat and whirls
it among the litter of blue-flowered convolvulus-
vine. The deacon grips his bundle of hymn-books
and pursues his property, while the horde of brown
children larking in the shallows jeer and laugh
derisively at his caperirigs.
* * * *
“L.L.” : I don’t want to raise too much of
a barny, but can any Abo. scribe tell me why a
boomerang acts as it does? What is the force,
motion or attraction that checks, turns and alters its
course? In short what is the principle of the thing?
“Wai-lioi”: Passed out. the other week at
Port Essington (N.T.) and buried at Spear Point, the
oldest abo: known in the Empty North. Jack
Davis . (“Port Essington' Jack”) was a young buck
when in 1838 Sir Gordon Bremer visited the North
Coast and re-settled Essington. Jack was in Darwin
three years ago, but lie g’ot the walk-about badly', and
wandered back to his own bade yard. The old chap
bad been blind and very feeble for some time, but
up to the last he gabbled about “Seggem Bemmer”
and the old redcoats who used to strut round the
ancient settlement. By the way, the old stone jetty
at Essington, faced here and there with ironwood
piles, is as good as when built 80 years ago.
“Cooky”": I know something about the
Australian (Sturt) desert-pea, eulogised by “Oscar"
(B. 5/9/' 18)Acres of them grow in tbe vicinity
of Broken Hill, and when they get sufficient moisture
to make a start, they transform the country into a
gorgeous picture. They are frequently grown in S.
Aus. town gardens. I’ve raised them from seed and
transplanted without trouble. My tip to “Oscar” is
not to trouble about preparation of the soil, but
plant in a sunny, position. In ' places where
usually garden plants turn up their toes the
Sturt pea thrives. One specimen with the right con-
ditions will cover an area of Bft. or 9ft. square with
a mass of bloom, and will keep flowering for many
months if hot allowed to seed.

THE HOUSEMAID.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
When the Winter takes the trac^
Like a swagman of the West,
With his swag upon his back
And his beard upon his breast,
Then the pretty housemaid Spring
(Sweet tiie greeting we accord her,
Sweet the songs the magpies sing!)
Comes to set our house in order.
In that house of light and mirth,
Double-lit by moon and sun,
Hoof of sky and floor of earth,
In and out of doors is one ;
Forests grow within its walls,
Set it is with hill and hollow,
In its,glooms the bcllbird calls,
In its glamor soars the swallow.
With her brush and pail and broom
And her apron, green and new,
As she trips from room to room
There is much for her to do.
There are-floors that slie must sweep,
Cobwebs brush from wall and ceiling;
Little time she lias for sleep—
Hurt and harm of Winter healing.
Little time she has for ease
And for hands upon her lap—
There’s her work among the trees,
Filling all their veins with sap;
There’s her work among the birds
And the butterflies, their neighbors.
Sure, beyond all tale of words,
Is the marvel of her labors !
Light of heart, through hour and hour
Hers the way and hers the will—
Putting nectar in the flower
That the bee may have his fill,
Tinting this and shaping that,
Ne’er at fault and ne’er uncertain —
Spreading here a grassy mat,
Hanging there a leafy curtain.
Portals locked and fountains sealed
Open at her touch and flow ;
Beauty, by her hands revealed,
Fronts the world with face aglow ;
At her summons Nature brings
Day on day of golden weather;
Music at her bidding sings,
Youth and Age rejoice together.
ACCORDING TO AN EARLIER RILL.
“He would himself have been a soldier but for those vile guns —Henry IV.
Old and gaunt, and grim and drear,
Winter’s gone with gust and gale,
And the housemaid Spring is here
With her brush and broom and pail;
Moving where the cobwebs lurk,
She will set our house in order.
Let us bless her at her work
And a greeting song accord her.

THE DIAGNOSIS.
BAGS: "What 's the matter with Jags lately? He looks very seedy."
SNAGS: “Fes, he's been keeping a pub."
BAGS: "But why the deuce is he seedy?"
SNAGS: "Well, as I say — he’s been keeping a pub.”
F.A.Q.”: To fight the dingo Queensland
Government is raising the scalp bonus from ss. to
£l. Considering that in the one district covered
by the Bulloo Marsupial Board, 7000 scalps were
paid for in a single year, downing the dingo is a
costly job. The dingo is a wise item. Too slow
to catch and kill a kangaroo in a sprint, he will
follow its scent for days and nights on end, giving
his quarry no time for rest or feed, until, worn out
and pannicky, the ’roo caves in.
“Leo Lear”: The finches are a bird family
that deserves a heap more consideration than they
receive. You’ll find some representative of the clan
in all parts of Australia. The red-browed fellow
seems the commonest. He’s all over the eastern and
southern parts; his red head and rump is often
mistaken for the fire-tail finch, a much rarer and
more beautiful bird with barred back and breast.
The spotted-sided finch, with his red rump and bill
and spotted black and white sides, is the most gaudy
of the Southern tribe; but the beautiful painted-finch
of the far North-West is the most handsome of all.
Two very common finches of Southern Queensland are
the chestnut-breasted and Bicheno finches; I’ve seen
them there in flocks no wit smaller than the flights
of starlings and sparrows in Victoria, with whom,
by the way, they are closely connected anatomically.
The family contains over 20 species in Australia,
most of which build large covered-in grass nests
noted for lack of sanitation. The birds are almost
wholly seed-feeders and are very local in habits,
never wandering far from the original home.
* * * *
“Vailima”: “Tongue” (B. 25/7/TS) is
wrong in saying that the record length of tongue in
proportion to size is held by the N.Q. hawk-moth.
A Madagascar species has a tongue 13in. in length.
When Darwin was working at the fertilisation” of
orchids he found a Madagascar specimen with a
nectary lQin deep, and he came to the conclusion
that it was polienated by a hawk-moth, which, to be
effective, must have a proboscis at least as long.
He was right. Soon afterwards the moth was col-
lected 'by a French scientific expedition.
“W.8.F.”: “Wonga” (B. 22/8/’18) , men-
tioning children’s corn-growing competitions in
Bananaland, might have given a cheer to the
encouragement the youngsters get. The prize-money
as distributed this last season is not known to the
writer; but for the season 1916-17, something like
£5O was served out by the Department of Agricul-
ture, one sturdy farmer-of-the-future getting away
with £l5. Uncle Sam also makes it worth a boy’s
while to pay attention to details. The Boys’ Corn
Club’s label is on every sack of corn grown by
members, and is copyrighted. With each bushel a
member sells he gives his signed guarantee as to
purity, etc. These boys are now supplying U.S.
with the stud corn from which the up-to-date farmer
raises his seed. The youngsters’ product always
tops the seed market. Solid prize-money is given,
but more prized is the silken bannerettes which are
handed over by the President at White House. The
winner in each district gets his free trip and all
expenses paid to Washington. In our Ma State a
committee was appointed three years ago to encourage
the . work here, but beyond issuing a pamphlet and
stating that “the matter of prize-money may well
be left to local effort nothing has yet been done.”
“San’’: The gauchos of the Argentine and
Patagonia are quite as robust in their notions of
life and death as were ever the soldiers of Tchaka
°' Cetewayo. Once, when descending an eastern
spur of the Andean range on the way back to
Buenos Aires, my mule suddenly propped on seeing
a snake on the rock before him, and, day dreaming, I
went right over his head. My Yankee companion
found that my right leg was badly broken. He
left me under the shade of a bush and started off
to the nearest estancia for help. It was early in
the forenoon, and I had smoked the last of my
cigarettes and was wondering how I was going to
put in the time until help came, when I heard a
clatter of hoofs and a gauebo came in sight around
the bend. He presently dropped down beside me
and began rolling the inevitable cigarette in the
deft manner of his kind. Answering his polite
inquiry I told him of my accident. He was very
sympathetic—seemed to be almost on the verge of
tears—and pressed his cigarette on me, saying” that
he supposed I should like a last smoke. I confided
in him that the accident would not be fatal. To
my astonishment he drew a long knife from its
sheath and began stropping it on his boot. “But,
senor,” he protested. “I cannot leave you here
like this! You will prefer, lam sure, that I should
put you out of your pain. Besides I must be quick
as I have to ride 20 miles before sundown.” With
that, being satisfied with the keenness of his weapon,
he came nearer and squatted on his heels, waiting
for the finish of my smoke. His earnestness began
to scare me. I found it was no use my explaining that
men of my race did not wish to die when a limb
was broken. He said that most likely my friend
would fail to come back, or, if he did, that the leg
would be badly set and I should be a cripple. “So,
seSor, just let me get behind you and I will strike
down over your left shoulder through the heart, and
you will know nothing.” The obliging stranger
seemed to mesmerise me, and my opposition w r as
growing weaker when I heard my friend’s voice
urging his mule upward. I was saved, but the
gaucho seemed to think I was lost. He went off on
his mule down the track, throwing me a glance of
mingled contempt and pity as he departed.

“Keith Iv.”: Travelling down from Towns-
ville to Ayr (Q.) in September the train passed
through thousands of native-companions. They looked
like slate-colored flocks of sheep in the distance, and
when the train approached they bowed gravely to it
or danced a few solemn steps. We struck the
friendly birds about two miles on the Townsville side
of Minehan, and it took us a good quarter of an hour
to pass them.
* * * *
“Conbar”: Though over 67 years have
elapsed since the ill-fated and ill-managed Burke and
Wills expedition came to grief at Innamincka, in
Central Australia, there is at least one of the party
still alive. When the expedition was leaving Pama-
rn!iroo, near Menindie, late in 1860, four blacks were
taken as guides. Among them was Wombey, who is
now a grizzly octogenarian earning a crust as a
rouseabout on Nockatunga station, in S.W. Queens-
land.
* * * *
Plum Poo” : Re the sex of pawpaw trees,
twenty years ago people in N.Q. were under the
impression that only the female tree bore fruit, and
that it was necessary to have a male tree in the
neighborhood. At Hide’s Hotel, in Cairns, two
pawpaw trees grew in the yard. One bore fruit
regularly; but the other was apparently useless.
Mis. Hides decided to have it cut down, as it wa,s
only in the way. The Chinaman who was told to
do the job was very upset. “Oh, no, Missie Hi’ !
Don’t cut down that feller. He alle same looster!”
* * * *
“Te Whare”: Excepting wild ducks and
the black swan, abnormally early breeders, I think
the lyre-bird and ipiouu-
tain-thrush are among the
first to make arrangements
for a family. In this
quarter (South Coast,
N.S.W.) lyre-birds have
been seen picking up sticks
in May. The enormous nest
must take a considerable
time to build, but I have
found one tenanted by a
large and vociferous chick
early in September. The
mountain-thrush starts its
beautiful shallow cup-nest
about June, using a good
deal of moss in the
material. As regards wild
duck, teal shot in July
have had soft-shelled eggs
inside their bodies, and
I’ve found a black swan’s
nest containing seven
fairly-well-incubated eggs
in the first week in June.
The yellow-throated scrub-
wren is also an early (or
very late) breeder. Have
taken his incubator, with
eggs, in May. Very heavy
rains, which destroy the
first clutches of eggs or
broods, sometimes result
in certain birds nesting
again late in the season.
Have noted this in the
case of the white-fronted
chat (“nun-bird”) and
spotted-sided and red-
eyebrowed finches (dia-
mond-sparrow and red-
head) and other species.
The Bagman”: How’s this for a multipli-
city of jobs ? At Cocamba (on the new line from Chil-
lingollah to Manangatang, in the Victorian mallee)
theie was for some time only one building—a store.
In addition to serving out groceries, fruit, meat,
bread, newspapers and some of the other necessities
of life, the proprietor was postmaster, caretaker of the
railway station, agent for I don’t know how many
machinery and other firms, photographer, registrar
of births and deaths, secretary to the Progress Asso-
ciation and local clubs, and keeper of meteorological
records. When the police wanted to serve a sum-
mons on one of the cockies thereabout they’d ’phone
along and arrange for the odd-job man to go and
collect the blister. Accommodation was provided
or travellers at the store, and the big dining-room
served as public hall for meetings and socials on week-
days, and as church for the travelling parson when
he happened on Sundays.
“Yarrumpa”: An interesting resident of
Central Australia is the lioney-ant. This insect is
found in dug-outs going down as far as five or six
feet. The opening is small, about an incli across;
but if you dig out one of the nests you will find
tunnels and crosscuts running from the main shaft.
In one or more of these chambers is found the true
honey-ant. The ordinary workers run the show as
a co-operative concern. They collect the honey,
bring it to the nest, and there feed it to certain
members of the clan. The sweet stuif is forced
into these animated pantries until the abdomen
becomes so large that the remainder of the ant is
a, fly-speck on it. The swollen ones are absolutely
helpless, and have to remain in the chambers. When
the honey season slackens off the community falls
back on their cold-storage supply. A kick in the
abdomen of the honey-ant, and that patient servant
of the camp disgorges his accumulated fodder and
once more resumes normal proportions.
“E.S.S.”: The grinder, or restless fly-
catcher, doesn’t fly into print half as much as willy
wagtail, and yet he closely resembles willy .in appear-
ance, and is just as engaging and friendly in manner.
Their habits are also very similar. The main differ-
ence is that the wagtail has a black throat, whereas
the whole of the under-surface of the grinder is
white. This cheery little creature hovers, butterfly-
like, over the grass, where it seeks its insect food,
emitting a peculiar rasping note, and intermittently
THE LOAFERS.
ALF (just out of the line after tough spell):
“Ain't this 'Eaven, Bill."
inquiring of the intruder: “Who are you?” Some
bird students say that its grinding note is used to
scare winged insects into flight, when they can be
easily caught. It loves the edges of scrubs and
swamps, and its cup-shaped bark nest is usually
placed on a bough of a tea-tree in or near a small
swamp.
EVENING.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
lh(? deop, cool shade of the dusk is creeping
Over the flats where the ranges end;
A glint of gold from a sunbeam leaping,
Gilds the oaks in the river bend.
While slanting shafts from the red sun, sinking,
Flash on the rock-scarred hillsides dim,
And wet leaves gleam like the camp-fires winking,
Dim, half-seen o’er a grey plain’s rim.
Swift, beating wings of the swans, home flying.
Burst through the webs that the mists have spun,
Till gold-barred plumes on the soft breasts hieing
Seem radiant tracks to the setting sun.
Amid the gums are the camp-fires throwing
Long, silvery arrows of quivering light
On pool and eddy of waters flowing
With mystic song to the gathering night.
The fleecy clouds of the grey smoke lifting,
Lingering, hang over vine and tree;
The rich perfume from its incense drifting
Makes the bush as some sanctuary.
N.S.W.

all this hobbling eloquence is justinwl. inis
labored humor while lie is on steamer from

Even the stokers are superior to anything I nave

stewards. 1 would not be surprised to learn that
there are many younger sons of distinguished families

Gradually the nicture fades away—the mangroves
and hills, pearling cutters and passing Reamers,
tender young cedars blushing red in the scrub,
colored tons of mango trees in flower, towering kauri,
cascades, 'waterfalls, flowering lantanas, white sails
beneath white clouds, aboriginal camp-fires, black
fishermen with poised spears upon coral rocks awash
with the incoming tides, tin-miners tents, maize
fields and farins, banana groves, the great plateau,
the poppet-heads, the tin-roofed towns, the forests
and the long rivers winding through silent places to
the gulf.
Some more about the Barrier :
Think of it studded from north to south with
islands —islands in clustered groups, in archipelagoes,
in tens, and twos and singles; islands keeping soli-
tarv sentinel over a wide sea plain ; tent-shaper
islands standing together like the camp of a sen
caravan; islands strung out like pearls on a queen s
necklace; islands scattered like golden coins from an
emperor’s hand ; islands where waving palms beckon
from white beaches; islands where tall pines stand
like grounded spears in a hall of giants; a shower
of islands scattered like raindrops all the way from
Capricorn to York; lighted with the rainbow and
sweetened by the wind that brings the showers.
When Australia Unlimited talks in another
tone it isn’t always very reliable, either. Lhe
N. S. Government is referred to thus:
During tlieir first fourteen months work of a
pioneering, exploratory and experimental nature -
tiie three State trawlers brought into the Sydney food
market no less than 2,504,00011 i. weight of choice
deep-sea fish.; This great bulk of fish has been cap-
tured bv the State’s ships and sold to the public at
an infinitesimal cost to the taxpayers It is expected
that the State trawlers ultimately will cost the tax-
payer nothing 1 .
This statement of the position is inaccurate.
The cost of the trawlers to the taxpayers has
been enormous. And who is it that expects
the trawlers to “cost the taxpayer nothing .
Certainly no member of Parliament nor the
Auditor-General. The loss has been at the
rate of thousands. Brady is. not all like
this, though many of his statistics are far
behind the times. The chapters on early
history and exploration are well done, though
the information is available in more detail
from books of lesser weight. Deposited in
shipping offices and in reading-rooms and
similar places the book may have a certain
usefulness and an appropriateness. The print-
ing is excellent; the illustrations are copious
and in the main attractive.
The Inky Way
“Jean Sibi”: Having duly considered
David Low’s “Billy Book.” two of three
mandarins of the daily press have solemnly
chastised the artist for his bitter contempt
towards his model. It is the old complaint
against strengthening the piquancy of the
art by the gay sense of satire inherent in
the artist, and we will hear a lot more still
of the inhuman urbanity which other
draughtsmen showed towards their subjects.
It is, however, beside the point whether the
over-rated Leech, the limited Keene, and
other geniuses of their epoch deprived
their models of the title of “victim.’ Un-
hampered by any of the legends and rever-
trices that afflict the easy gentlemen who
write about his work, Low has gone ahead
and treated Hughes as a fussy little man
with a lot of human faults. But nowadays
(according to convention) there can be no
lionestv in the expression of a tempera-
ment. whatever the medium. To be popular
with the incurable hero--worshippers. Low
should temper his criticism in accordance
with the daily-paper custom of preserving
due respect for “the ruling-classes. (ihe
ruling-classes are the people who daren t
ask for water-cress because the waiter would
feel hurt.) Because Low chooses to depict
the pictorially valuable phases of Hughesian
egotism, he is charged with specialising in
malice. Low has merely drawn Hughes as
he knows him. And few' men know him
better.
“Briefless”: The Victorian P.L.C. has

The Call has now two ex-legislators on its
staff. Ex-Senator Findley runs the canvas-
sing department.
“Pas” McDonald, a skilled Australian of
quick caricature, has been badly hit in one
leg by Fritz. He left home to help make
caricatures of the Huns with a bayonet
some months ago.
The Balmain (Sydney) Observer defines
the anonymous letter writer: —
What wo think of anonymous letter writers:
The sneak thief is a gentleman compared to such
low-down, mangy skunks, and their proper place
—well, we were nearly going to say a leper lazaretto;
but it would be an insult to those poor Unfortunates
to even allow such wastrels to be cast within a
reasonable distance of them. The Great Creator
gave breath to the anonymous letter writer, and
scandalmonger, and sectarian mischiefmaker —out
He also created snakes, death-adders and scorpions.
They should be a.ll housed together on some distant
island, where they might be the targets of some
fell disease to which the human flesh- is heir.
Avoid such human carrion*, if yon know them their
name is temptation and damnation, and they leave
a trail of corruption wherever their abominable and
filthy bodies move.
Now, what is an editor who doesn t sign
his articles if he is not an anonymous letter
w liter ?

THE BHYMSTER'S DOOM.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Bonn earned his daily bread and cheese
Concocting rhymes not unlike these.
Ambitions high and brave had he,
But editors so terse
Admired his fine felicity
In building lowly verse;
So everything upon the earth
Bonn strove to turn to rhythmic mirth.
All men who for a moment shone
His tinkling talent pounced upon.
He turned to verse a death or birth :
A wedding he would sing.
In jingle of a moment’s Worth
lie set a clown or king.
And Bonn, poor, hapless fellow, soon
Began to live and breathe in tune-.
. He strode on good iambic feet.
Or danced in dactyls down the street.
He said: “I would impute no fault
To any person here,
But will' you kindly pass the salt,
And hand around the beer?”
At length his heart evolved a neat
Amusing, anapestic beat.
He asked your healtli in faultless tune,
To measure of a pleasing rhune
He bought his boots or took a drink.
Asked what the time might be
He answered with the fall and chink
Of pretty poesy.
His watch, he found, ticked off the time
In unpremeditated rhyme.
The dancing, singing man became
A creature of a dubious fame.
Two doctors called on him, and took
A pessimistic view,
And then he rhymed just like a book
The whole way out to Kew.
There Bonn sits centred in his curse,
A rhymed, revolving uni-verse.

Children’s Books. —The Weston Co., Ltd., of Syd-

trade in child literature with a trial edition of
five booklets. The only imported thing about them
are their age-old mirsery-rh.vme titles. Designs,
blocks, verses, die-cutting and printing are Austra-
lian, and Little Miss Muffet. instead of merely being
a figure drawn on a square page, is a stamped-out
cardboard personage whose pages of verse, crowded
behind, dutifully imitate their owner’s outline. The
other booklets of the series are built on the same
attractive plan. Price is Is.

The Sinner, bv W. J. Eccott (Blackwood, London).
Here's a 'stow‘with a plot, an atmosphere and a
direct interest for everybody who knows that the
world is fighting Germany. A sample scrap of the
conversation: — , ..
“Australia would suit Germany admirably, sau
Carnovius. “But it has had so much .liberty so
long that I’m afraid the German immigrants we
should, as fast as possible, pour in would become so
steeped in these democratic doctrines that we should
have to reconquer it every 10 years.
The book is admirably written, and has a upple o
humor which balances the tendency to approach melo-
drama.
Ba&kbloclc Ballads and Later Verses, by C. J. Dennis.
In this book, which has just been issued m a fine
dress with illustrations by Hal Gye, are many old
favorites written by “Deiv* in the days before 'he
Sentimental Bloke” won him a place as steady
favorite among Australian readers. In those eailiei
days his hand was not so sure, and he had not
learned to play with such deftness upon the strings
of the public heart; but in his work there was the
distinct promise of all and more than has yet come
to fulfilment. The book opens with “An Old Master,
a vigorous descriptive ballad that is certain to win a
wide popularity. “Grimbles and the Gnad’ is a
fanciful dittv ' which, working on the House-that-
. Tack Built principle, contrives to blend satire effect-
ively with quaint humor. “The Austral-aise” is
there with all the blanks for Billjim to fill in accord-
ing to his fancy; and 1 the grim and heart-calling
“Jov Ride” stands as a typical example _of the
author’s later and-, more mature work. There is
a good deal in the book about politicians and their
ways—notablv in “The Builders,” “Vulgar Frac-
tions” and' “The Bridge Across the Crick
—and all through, from the first page to the
last, there is the sturdy Australian note and a
voice that, strenuous or modulated, is always
different from that of our other verse writers.
This latest work of “Den’s” is a little handicapped
by the fact that, while it contains his trial flights,
it follows upon books of such distinction written
much later. He is- his own chief competitor; and
some of the work in the present volume is a trifle
crude. There is a tendency to beat out a simple
theme to too great length, and to lose force and
driving power by saying the same thing over half a
dozen times in different words. Taking full account
of these faults, however, the book is a worthy one
and one that will be bought and treasured by thou-
sands who have learned to love the “Bloke.” It is
not poetical; it is not literary in any fine sense; it
does not grip the soul as does the work of Henry

notable and pleasing addition to the Australian
bookshelf. (Angus and Robertson, Sydney.)
“The Dinlcy-Di Soldier and other Jingles.” Ammu-
nition bv Norman Campbell, fired by Leonard Neilson.
—This is a book of cheery verse which does not aim at
any special distinction, but whi6h should make a strong
appeal to anv number of readers both in and out of
khaki. Here and there the verse goes clean out
of tune, and the obvious and commonplace tag is
often dragged in with some violence to eke out a
line; but it is all the sort of stuff that would get
a good hearing if recited just behind the place
where the Hun shells fall or on the safer vaudeville
stage in Australia. Although Norman Campbell
does not appear to take himself very seriously as a
verse-writer, there is a hint of something m his
present work which suggests the possibility of
higher achievement. With his light but genuine
vein of humor he might go some distance if he got
down sincerelv and strenuously to his job-
verses in the little book are not by any means all
soldier verses; but the jingles which refer to the
war overshadow the rest. “ ’Omesick, , the plaint of
a Cockney in Australia, is as good as anything in
the collection. (Tyrrell’s, Ltd., Sydney.)
Business, Bobbery, etc.
H. B. Ilees, M.L.C., of Victoria, lately
wrote home concerning the Federal Govern-
ment’s purchase of cornsacks in Calcutta.
Rees —-who claims to speak with the know-
ledge derived from over 30 years’ experience
among sacks in V ic.—was lately in Cal-
cutta, where he had a close-up look at the
jute industry. Among the things he reckons
lie saw (enormous profiteering among manu-
facturers and Stock Exchange gamblers were
some of the things) was that:
Our Australian politicians cut very small figures
when in the market for cornsacks and dealing with
the Scotsmen who control the mills and the Mar-
waris of Calcutta. Last year Senator Russell tried
to deal direct, but was too late for the season.
Early this year he got in through the Indian Gov-
ernment, and after long negotiations he purchased
60 000,000 bags from the Jute Mills Association at
rupees 42.8 per 100 f.0.b., with Zfc per cent, com-
mission to somebody here, the c.i.f. price being
about 9s. Old. per dozen landed. Our merchants, being
in the market early, had purchased about one-
third of our requirements at a price considerably
below this, by contracts made last year; but the
Government stepped in and paid compensation to
all concerned. lam informed that contracts are
now being made by and on behalf of Australian
merchants with individual mills foi next yeai .
hags at about rupees 38 per 100. To further show
the profits, it is worth mentioning that the Imp^. ml
Government has commandeered) oM-iJird .of
the total output of these mills. After due in
auiries it fixed the price for its requirements, allow-
in<>- the mills 10 per cent, profit above the actual
cost. The price it pays averages five, compaied
to 18 we pay under the contract. .
It boils down to this. Russell was late m
the market, and there is little excuse for that.
He was told often enough to get a move on.
And when he did arrive someone was in a
position to drive a hard bargain with lum
and drove it. * #
Melbourne badly needs a supervising
authority to keep an eye on its suburban
war-time house-building; enterprises. ai
present each municipality has a building
surveyor,” besides employing, in some cases,
a qualified all-round tradesman to visit
premises in course of construction. Mostij
the job of these officials is to see that the
right sizes of timber are used and the propei
qualitv of bricks and mortar. Beyond that
their 'influence doesn’t seem to reach very
far. The high and increasing prices ot
materials—said by some experts to mean an
all-round advance of not less than oo pei
cent, in housebuilding costs since 1914
brings the skimping contractor into his own.
Ilis job is to make a £5OO villa look like a
bargain at £650. He does it with artistic
simplicity” as his watchword. This sort or
fraud gets in his fine work in the interior
fittings, though he also manages to get pas
the building surveyor in lots of neat little
ways while the frame is going up. u n<
out of the supervisor’s sight, inside tnc
house he makes chaste door-frames ot tm ■
unmoulded timber, hews fireplace-furmtuie
out of solid half-inch planks, uses strips ot
four-inch stuff for skirtings, makes one Ugnt
nail do the work of two heavier ones, starves
his mortar and plaster, finishes woodwork
with a single, faint brushing of oil. and rebec
on a neat-but-not-gaudy effect to bulldoze
the unprotected buyer. The limit was
recently reached in this kind of modem co
struction with the employment by a buimei
of softwood shingles, one-eighth of an men
thick, to weatherboard the end gables ot a
small “desirable villa” built to a £6OO ordei.
This sort of robbery needs attention.

Frank Clarke, Vic. Minister for Lands,

could. The people of Egypt have long since

IN LURKING SILENCE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Potatoes were quiet.” —Market report.
In the warm Spring they lie as if in death,
Deaf to the distant rumble of the guns.
All birds awake to sing with happy breath;
But never murmur through their slumber runs.
All Sussex-strcet may lift its prices high,
But these iest on and never sprout an eye.
The cauliblossom and the carrot leap,
The onion cannot keep its prices still;
Cheese, though proclaimed, is very hard to keep,
And honey with persistence climbs the hill;
But the brown tubers hear the swift hours chime,
And in a dreadful silence wait their time.
Bush roses scent the air in Martin-place,
Chaff, hay and turnips give a warning shout;
And, gazing on the taxes face to face,
The war-lamed pocket wriggles inside out.
The brown potato waits till Spring is done
To rise like other things and blame the Hun.

ACID CAUSES INDIGESTION.
An unpleasant feeling of fulness after
meals, a flushed face, heartburn and wind
are all readily recognised symptoms of indi-
gestion and dyspepsia, but very few people
realise that the direct cause of all these
troubles is excess acid in the stomach.
To prevent food fermentation and over-
come this harmful acid there is nothing finer
than half a teaspoonful of bisurated mag-
nesia taken in a little warm or cold water
directly after each meal, and if more people
would only use this simple home remedy
instead of drugs there would soon be no more
indigestion.
Be sure, however, to get bisurated mag-
nesia as ordinary forms are often unsuitable

lately, has had the deserved good fortune to

giant Chang s tremendous fist many a time.
The famous Chinese died at his home at
Bournemouth (Eng.), on November fi, 1893,

wife, who died in the early part of that
year. His coffin was nearly Bft. <3in. long.
Chang was 19 years of age when lie first
exhibited himself in London. His height
then (1565) was 7ft. 9in. He continued to
grow for over five years, and arose to a
height of Bft. lin. (He was a genial, gentle
soul, an athletic-loolfing figure, and had a
mild, agreeable face. One of his fads
was to adorn himself with a bro-
ciided robe of wliite silk, a massive
string of beads round his neck, a fan in his
hand, a cap, and thick white sandals. Show-

London’s latest German -spy
play, “The Hidden Hand,”
had some difficulty in getting
a license from the'Lord Cham-
berlain’s department. Several
objections were raised and a
number of modifications .-had to
be made before the permit for
production was issued. In par-
ticular, the presentation of the,
principal Huh villain as a
member of the Privy Council
was officially regarded'as offen-
sive, and had to be eliminated,
although, as a matter of fact,
more than. one naturalised Ger-
man were entitled to put the
initials P.G. after their names
when the war broke’ out. Ob-
jection was also taken to the
use of the word “bloody,”
although it was permitted krone
of Bernard Shaw.’s- - plays.
The Plidden Hand” is a
very preachy propagandist piece of stage
work intended to show that the foolishness
ot regarding naturalised Germans in Eng-
land as friendly until they are actually found
out is a perilous policy.
“Melb”: The revival of “The Two
Jrphans at the Princess’s (Melb.) recalls
that this powerful French drama was first-
seen in London with William Bignold
(Georges brother) as Jacques, Neville as
Iierro, and Mrs. Huntley (mother of the
tamuiar Gaiety comedian) as Mother
Frochard. In New York, Eellew was the
original Pierre, maybe excelling all in the
cast. The original cast here included:
Jacques, W. G. Carey; and Pierre, Wheat-
leigh. The two orphans were Misses Dun-
nmg and Lingard. Ireland, Harrie’s father
was also in the show. A later cast had
vvilliam Kignold as Jacques and George
Eignold as Pierre. The resemblance was
effective, but heroic George could not squeeze
well into the part of Pierre.
In hunting for Australian talent Bert
Bailey does not confine himself to the
i metropolis. Several of his most popular
players have been picked up in the country,
the latest find” of this sort being Grade
JJoiran. I nor to her appearance as the
heioine of What Happened to Mary,” she
was unknown to Melbourne; but as a young-
ster of 13 she played the Little Mother in
a co. touring “The Fatal Wedding.” and
afterwards, with Phillip Lytton’s co.. became
to -oackblocks ‘first nighters” what Muriel
k an is to the town gallery girl. It was a
clever move of Bailey’s to introduce the
hi ight Australian girl to Melbourne as a
leading lady in Show week, for her name
meant more to the Hayseed contingent than
that of many an imported starette.
“S.T.S.”: As to “gairl.” Can anyone
guess whether it is a mere passing trick of
London fashion, like dropping the “g” from
such words as “hunting,” or a come-to-stay
innovation such as that of the Oxford “a,”
which half a century ago taught as to say
“bahth” and “mahster,” where the “a” had
previously been as short as they still are in
blii.-k cat and banker? Certain it is that, if
Yu’, are in touch with London ways, “gairl”
is now the pronunciation. One writer there
calmly announqed lately that anyone using
the old style (which till yesterday was never
challenged) would be capable also of saying
“lidy.” Jack Cannot is. very clear with
“gairl,” in defiance of the rhymes he has to
sing. Most of the song-writers, these times,
are Americans, who don’t worry about the
line points, and cheerfully make “go home”
rhyme with "Salome.” After all, any change
may be good for our language. Only a century
ago it was still a vulgarism to give “oblige”
any other than a French sound—“obleedge.”
I, myself, can remember old people who in-
sisted on giving the newly-invented “as-
pliaite” its (probably correct) Greek three
syllables, with the accent on the second.
SAME JOB, NEW ADDRESS.
CHORUS: “What’s happened to that clumsy
scene-shifter—the one that was aheays
knocking the scenery down?”
BAILET: “Oh. he’s still scene-shifting—with
the artillery in France, you know.”
From London : t
Although not exactly “an orgy of wit and irony,’’
as one dramatic critic calls Arnold Bennett’s new
play, “The Title,’’ produced at the Royalty, it does
contain a fair number of smart- and sarcastic lines.
The dialogue is a good deal better than the charac-
terisation, which is somewhat weak and unconvinc-
ing. Hunting .and scheming for honors and titles
have been satirised on the stage many times,
but the recent wildly-extravagant distribution
of these baubles by the Lloyd George Govern-
ment has invested Bennett’s treatment of the
subject with immediate and topical interest. Eva
Moore carried off all the acting honors with a capi-
tal and realistic portrait of a climbing, pertinacious
female.. Lord Northcliffe and the rest of the Harms-
worth journalistic family were chaffed a good deal
o\er their absorbing desire to run the Government and
the country through the instrumentality of pontifical
leading articles gramophoned from' Northcliffe’s head-
quarters all over the land. “The Government is
practically a department of the Daily Mail,” says
one of the characters.
‘ Minor Key” : Had the bad luck to sit in
tront of an applauding machine the other
night. I didn’t look round, but I think his
hands were three feet across and faced with
best pull-hide. He applauded in my ear all
mgiity and it was like sitting in front of a
pom-pom. All the items were the same to
him—mere excuses to dash his flappers
together and make explosive sounds. One
duet was particularly dull, but it ended on
a high note with the kettle-drums rolling
noisily while both singers stretched their
arms to the gallery. The excited lunatic
behind stood up and fired 700 shots. Make
sufficient noise on the stage and in the
orchestra well, and the feather-headed go
quite drunk. It’s as sure as feeding
whisky-soaked wheat to fowls.
ic” : The death of Robert Kennedy, in
Melbourne, leads me to take up the charm-
ing biography of his eminent father, David
Kennedy,. prince of Scotch singers and re-
citers, written by a daughter, Marjory, who
was. familiar in Sydney and Melbourne.
David was a house-painter bv trade, yet lie
decorated a ceiling at Buckingham Palace.
A robust tenor, lie became a church pre-
centor in Edinburgh and developed into a
public, entertainer, lie was very popular in
Scotland, England, Canada and the United
States.
. “I! ,; : The influence of the liviug-
picture comedians on the rough-and-tumble
comic men in revues and work of the kind
begins to excite comment. Two or three
funhy men of the speaking stage I have in-
spected lately presented a marked resem-
blance in make-up and method to a couple
of well-known rougli-aiid-ready film clowns,
and lmock-about stuff that had almost worn
out its welcome in vaudeville 20 years ago
suffers a feverish revival, for no reason but
that picture patrons manifest a great pre-
ference for that kind of thing in the dumb
shows. A “feature” in a revue I sat out last
night consisted in three men knocking each
other down consecutively and vigorously for
five minutes, no verbal interruption worth
mentioning being permitted. In fact, one
notices how rarely the spoken matter .in
entertainments of this kind is worth men-
tioning. Early in the career of the movies
we lamented as the greatest drawback the
fact that the characters could not make
themselves heard; now we begin to perceive
that it is the one thing really to be grateful
for.
This comes from the spot:—
The latest development of American theatrical
enterprise in bringing to London not only the
principals, but also a full-sized .“beauty chorus”
from New York (chorus salaries ranging from *5
a week upwards), has had the effect of considerably
raising the status and the salary of the competent
London chorus girl. Some of her is now drawing
£lO a week, with contracts running over three years.
TO MELINDA—OR IS IT MAY?
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
As seen upon the cunning stage
You’re very slim and sweet,
And when you in the dance engage
Few look upon your feet—
Or, if they do, forgive you, clear -
Your eyes are large and crystal clear.
Your hair is like a cloud of gold,
And no one doubts its truth;
All feel that in you they behold
The angel that is youth.
80 comes about the curious thing
That no one hates you when you sing!
Your mouth is small, and like a rose
That some harsh hand, has torn,
Tour figure in its wondrous pose
Is woman’s grace new, horn,
lienee comes the gratifying fact
That men forgive you though you act.
VICTORIA.

The State loan booms having come to an
end, cos. like this are not likely to be kept
so busy as they used to be. So it is not
surprising that the directors should report
that “very few domestic water-supply
schemes are being carried out owing to
shortage of funds.” However, the co. has
completed only half its contract to supply
49in. pipes to the Tas. Government, and it
has also secured a £4OOO contract with the
N. S. Wales Public Works Dept, for 14in.
and lGin. karri pipes as a supplementary
main to the 14 miles the co. installed in
1913 for the Broken Hill water supply.
This work will keep the co. busy for a
while, but otherwise apparently the" most it
anticipates is the commencement of further
hydro-electric schemes, and, possibly, de-
veloping a small overseas trade. However,
it seems clear that the co. has proved that
the wooden water-pipe is quite satisfactory,
and in view of the probable continued
shortage of iron and the high price of the
metal the co. should get a good share in
any new water schemes. Anyhow, prospects
are not very bright; the profits for the
past few years have been rather poor, and
as the table shows the payment of the 6 p.c.
dividend has cut into reserves. Capital is
£70,000; and £39,925 is in property and
plant—there are factories on the Lane Cove
(Sydney), Footscray (Vic.) and at Port
Adelaide—£33,o6o is in stocks, £14,746 is
due by sundry debtors, and there is £1977 in
cash. Liabilities amount to £14.269.

Interesting things are being done at
Kandos, on the Mudgee line (N.S.W.), where
the N. S. Wales Cement, Lime and Coal Co.
is manufacturing Portland cement. A low
mountain ridge divides the co.’s property of
2000 acres, and on one side are situated a
limestone quarry and shale deposits providing
almost unlimited supplies of raw material.
In addition, a coal-mine has been opened in
the side of a mountain close by, and is turn-
ing out 300 tons a day, half the output being-
used by the co. and the remainder being
purchased by the Government. The cement
factory, which is itself an illustration of the
possibilities of cement construction, houses a
plant installed at a cost of £300,000. The
factory is half a mile from the coal-mine, and
is sufficiently handy to the limestone quarry
to be fed by an endless chain of buckets. For
the supply of raw material and power the
co. is thus most fortunately situated, and
this, together with modern plant, has meant
economy of labor and a big saving in costs.
So much for the industrial side of the co.’s
operations. On the other side of the ridge,
quite sheltered from all industrial activity, is
the township of Kandos. It is a model and a
modern township, housing 1200 inhabitants,
including 400 employees of the co., and is
built on a site which the co. cut up into
business and residential blocks. All the
facilities of an up-to-date town are afforded
the residents of Kandos; and the settlement
itself betrays no evidence of the thriving in-
dustry at its back door. The N.S.W. Lime
and Cement Co. was established only two
years ago, and is now, after various war hin-
drances, well into its stride. The present
output is at the rate of 60,000 tons cement
per annum.

“M.P.A.” concerning some nuggets:—
The Welcome nugget, discovered at Bakery Hill,
Ballarat (Vic.), and the Welcome Stranger nugget,
found on the surface at Moligul (Vic.) and referred
to in recent issues of The Bulletin, are represented
in plaster at Melbourne Museum. A card describing
the Welcome bears the name of John Greenwood,
who presented the bit of plaster to the trustees.
The late John Greenwood, one of the pioneers of the
Forest Creek diggings (Vic.) and the first miner to
sink below the basalt rock thereabouts in ’5l and
’52, in later years joined the Mines Dept, and made
models of all the sizeable nuggets unearthed. The
fine display of plaster nuggets at the Melbourne
Exhibition of 1880 was his doing-. A year
or so later he left the Mines Department and
made a trip abroad, with a comprehensive collection
of model nuggets for exhibition purposes. When he
opened up his cases he found, owing to rough hand-
ling, most of the models were smashed, so he had a
busy time getting them into shape. He opened his
display and lecture on the mineral wealth of Aus-
tralia at the Criterion Theatre, Blackpool (Eng.).
After his lecturing he returned to Australia
and continued his work as a prospector. Quite
apart from his early association with Forest Creek,
Sailors’ Gully, and the neighboring parts where he dis-
covered the Liverpool and Greenwood reefs, he travelled
the various mining-fields of Australia, Tasmania
and Maoriland. At Silvertown he had the option
of one of the choicest bits on the field for £lOOO,
but the small Melbourne syndicate he represented
couldn’t find the cash. In the roaring ’fifties Green-
wood was a personality on the diggings. On account
of his knowledge of drugs and his well-filled medicine
chest, he used to doctor sick diggers. He had been
apprenticed to the merchant service, and was making
his final trip for his master’s certificate when the
ship arrived in Port Phillip. The gold-fever had
the township in its grasp, ind Greenwood finally left
his ship and made for the diggings. On several
occasions the miners asked him to oppose the sitting
member for Castlemaine in the Victorian Parliament,
but he declined. Greenwood had some histrionic
ability and w-as 'well known for his Shakspearean
readings at the institutes of the district. He left
three sons and three daughters, and the-entire-family
are residents of Melbourne to-day.

Brighter Homes.
In no sense can a Home be a Home
where the lighting is not all that it
should be.
Bright, cheery homes are a reflex of
a happy household. Where the light
shines bright and cheerful there may
be found the true conditions which
make for happiness and health.
No matter how far your home is
removed from the centre of popula-
tion the difficulties of lighting can
be overcome by the installation. of
QUIRK’S SAFETY
AIR GAS SYSTEM.
It gives the whitest artificial light
yet invented.
For country homes it is unsurpassed.
Not only is it the best reading light
possible, but in the drawing-room,
the billiard-room and the living-
room it will be found to be all that
can be desired.
In smaller country homes the com-
fort of the family is enhanced 100
per cent, by the installation of the
system, the running-cost of which is
inconsiderable and, once installed,
requires no technical knowledge to
maintain. During the hot summer
months the housewife will find
Quirk’s Air Gas System for cooking

Long Lives Lived by flotor Lorries.
A motor lorry lives longer in four
weeks of war service than is de-
manded in years of commercial
usage. In the former Clydesdales
are faithfully doing their bit, and
in the latter their inbuilt Stamina
brings a new phase of durability to
bear on the user’s problems.

THE BREATH OF SPRING.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
’Tis Spring! ’Tis Spring! I’m living bricked
Within a city hard,
My little narrow life is ticked
Off ’tween the street and yard;
But, oh, I know the Spring is here.
Not that the sky is blue and clear,
But incense all the zephyrs bring,
The one authentic breath of Spring.
Gay Spring has com?. She’s pictured young,
A creature lithe and free,
As fresh and sweet as Venus sprung
But newly from the sea.
But ’tis in essence that she floats .
Before my sense in ferry-boats.
In train, or train, or picture show
Spring breathes upon me, and I know.
Not scent of yellow daffodils,
Nor wattle’s rich perfume
That all the distant valley fills
Bring Spring to one for whom
The suburb is a narrow gaol.
The lips of strangers* tell the talc,
Assurance comes from all my kin—
The young Spring onion is in!
VICTORIA.
BILIA T.
The policy of the banks in helping sub-
scribers to take up slabs of War Loan by
instalments spread over 18 months is very
good the first time, but not so helpful after-
wards. A regular subscriber under this plan
would, have one set of instalments running
for the first six months, two sets for the
second and three sets for the third. Very
few people can enter for the third race with
the first and second still unfinished, and a
good many find one sprint at a time suffici-
ent and two rather like bigamy. So fresh
relays of lenders must be found, by compul-
sion, if necessary.
“5.M.,” his protest:—
An earnest pacifist, Davies, M.L.A., demanded last
week in N. S. Wales Assembly that the Cornstalk
kid should not he taught about “the lives of kings,”
the same being demoralising. He wanted the off-
spring instructed only in “industrial history and
economics.” It opens up a dusty prospect for the
progeny. The Norman Conquest, for instance,
made a mighty difference in the industrial and
economic state of England, but if Harold and his
predecessors were cut out, likewise William and his
successors, and the shindy of the two kings at Senlac
is represented as a strike for higher wages, there
will be a great lack of hair on the cranium of
the infants’ knowledge. Roman and Hebrew history
would be even worse; the Book of Kings, with' the
kings all censored along with their lives and ' their
wives, not to mention other men’s wives, would be
painfully scant and sketchy. Bathsheba, for in-
stance, the lady who washed on the housetop, wasn’t
either industrial or economic. But she persuaded
her senile husband to divert the succession to her
young son, and the young son had to be crowned
in a hole-and-corner way without the necessary popu-
lar confirmation, ' because the popular assembly
would have probably seen him blowed first, and the
autocratic attitude thus taken up led 40 years later
to the breaking of the kingdom, and the two frag-
ments fell because they weren’t strong enough to
stand alone, and captivities and dispersions followed,
and the whole course of history was diverted, and
Davis Goldstein gave evidence in the I.W.W. case in
Sydney, all because Bathsheba washed herself on the
roof about 3000 years ago. If that history was
bowdlerised to suit Davies, son of Bowdler, the
lesson that it is unwise to elope with married
women who wash on the roof would be lost. (I am
not sure that Bathsheba was on the roof, but David
was anyhow.) The volume of human progress con-
sists largely of the uprisings of the people against
sovereigns who led bad lives. If the sovereigns and
their lives are deleted, then the people will be rising
at nothing, for no cause, and throwing themselves at
the atmosphere. In the case- of, say, Charles 1., it
would even be a matter of beheading the atmosphere.
The tale of that potentate shows how he tried to
prop up absolutism; how he married a. female prop
like himself; and they begat two props like both of
them, only worse, and how results ensued as results
often do. With these family details omitted a lot
of constitutional and industrial and economic hap-
penings would be a dance of shadows round a void, or
a, protest against invisible gas, I would like-the
opinion of- Davies, M.L.A., about making pants for
piano legs to hide their nakedness. Naked legs are
as demoralising to children as kings. Besides, they
support an implement of luxury which occupies as
much space as four small children learning economics.
Some politicians are either pitiably igno-
rant or they are the kind of men who would
make jokes at a death-bed. McGarry, M.L.A.,
talked in X. S. Wales Assembly last ‘week
about settling returned soldiers on “good
wheat lands" about Hillston. There are
5,000,000 or 0,000.000 tons of wheat already
awaiting shipment—some of it paid for by
the British Government, some of it paid for
by the Australian Government at starvation
rates out of loans. And because of the want
of ships and the impossibility of buying
wheat indefinitely with loan money and stack-
ing it away indefinitely, the Australian
farmer is being urged to grow less wheat.
Anyhow Hillston (494 miles from .Sydney,
where presumably the wheat is to*go). in a
rather dry country which has been losing
population for 20 years, is a devil of a place
to settle wheat-growing warriors in. Then
Ley. ALL.A., said that the railway workers
didn’t "get a fair share of the go al things
produced by their labor.” As it happens, they
get everything produced by their lab >r anil
more, the “more” being the amount of the
railway deficit. Probably if some of the debt
was paid off so that the lines’ had less in-
terest to carry, and if there was, some big
places, especially manufacturing places, for
railways to point to besides . Sydney the
employees might have a bigger sum to'-divide'.
Also something might be done by another
really robust increase in charges. Ley flapped
his wings and bleated vaguely about “co-
operation.” But then the real owners of the
railways, the outside money-lenders, won’t
co-operate, except that they have just added
nearly £300,000 a year to the interest bill
over a small renewal transaction.
A start has been,made on the “ocean-high"
way” along the Victorian coast from Barwon
Heads to Lome, designed to open up a lot of
sparsely-settled but valuable backbloeks
country. The two notable points about the
undertaking are that it is to be carriefl out
by returned soldiers and financed by volun-
tary contributions. The enterprise is being
organised by Edward Hendy, who has just
put the first party of returned men on the job.

The original “Fx & R” Watches are known through-
out Australasia for their marvellous accuracy and'
endurance.
But, as usual, we progress, and so now we are
showing the
SUPER “Fx & R” WATCH.
Its present price is 635. in steel case, but what a
watch it isi Every latest improvement known to
horological science is in it.
It is jewelled in every part where wear occurs. It
will go with profound accuracy, indeed it is so accu-
rate that a ship could be steered to. England;by it.
For strength and standing up against hard wear
we unhesitatingly say that no watch the world over
equals the SUPER “Fx & R” Watch.

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
Sydnky, Octohek 7,191 S.
My Deak Akini,—
The big garden parly in honor of the
French Mission attracted a crowd of society
butterflies. The brilliant sunshine that
played round the wind-tossed gardens of
Government House was tempered by a wintry
nip, and thin summer frocks went with pale-
blue noses. Lady Davidson and his Ex. shook
1000 pairs of hands on the old verandah. The
lady of the house was in dove-grey plumage
flecked with rose. The Monash dame received
a bombardment of congratulations upon her
husband’s work at the Front. Judge Harris,
recently ill, paced the lawn with his tall
lady, and the ex-Mayoral Hennessys of Mel-
bourne beamed on a swarm of Sydney
friends. Mrs. Carty Salmon, in mourning,
made a quiet pilgrimage amongst old friends.
She went back to Melbourne before the Race
Week fuss.
Danger Owen, K.C., recently made 0.8. E.,
deserves something more than that. And
he has it. That’s the gratitude of
fathers, mothers, sisters and brothers,
to say nothing of sweethearts, of the
soldier boys. He has put aside _ many
briefs every month to give his services 1o
the Red Cross. The Inquiry Bureau in Dal-
ton House is his stronghold, and nothing is
too much trouble for him.
Archbishop Wright and his lady have
reached their 25th milestone matrimonially.
By way of a souvenir the Anglican pillars
of the Synod presented his Gaiters and his
lady with a handsome salver and tea-set.
Albert Gould expressed good wishes on behalf
of the black coats.
The Actors’ Association matinee didn’t get
the house it deserved. The stress of
patriotic days weighs heavily. The show
was good, and one of the best things in it
was a first production in Sydney of “The
Monkey’s Paw”—a vivid little play by W.
W. Jacobs. Arthur Styan, J. B. Atholwood
and Katie Towers were the strong posts of
the shuddersome plot.
A lean, bronzed Englishman, John 11.
Dunn, who. has fought in Gallipoli and Pales-
tine, gave the new catchy comic song, “I’m
on the Staff,” at the Actors’ Matinee. He
is a son of that Sir William Dunn who was
Lord Mayor of London a year ago. Dunn,
junior, linked up with the Maoriland forces
in 1914, as he happened to be over there at
the time. He’s a delicate-looking mortal, but
stuck it out at the Front for three years.
The Randwick meeting was chilled by a
biting wintry wind for the first day. There
was promise of heavy rain, but the woman
who put on her worst hat, seized a gamp, and
reached the course in ancient garments was
the Cinderella of a fine, though cold after-
noon. There Avasn’t even a patter of rain
to lay the dust when the field raged up the
straight.
In pale faAvn tints Mrs. C. E. Waters
achieved one of the most striking race-gowns
on Saturday. Furs Avere the most comfort-
able wear. Mrs. D. It. Hall’s dark-blue
frock had as a cape an ermine wrap only
surpassed by a small rug of the same snoAV-
Avhite pelt above which the nose of Mrs.
H. D. Mclntosh Avas visible. Many shiver-
ing women, though driven to take cover in
the stands, turned out frequently in clouds
of ninon Avith only lace insertion to protect
them from the breeze. One dame in fine
Avhite drapery was storm-beaten against the
laAvn fence, with a slender walking-stick as
her strongest breakwind. Little Eugenie
Moreau, in saffron yellow, Avrapped herself
in tulle. The T. 11. Kelly family—mother
in a smart cream tailor-built rig-out.—mus-
tered in full strength. There were some amaz-
ing confections made as tight as possible
round the knees. The tube skirt is back. Silk
capes of the shape and size favored by a
chorus of heaA r y conspirators as in “Rigo-
letto,” are going to be the thing this summer.
They are merely caught round the shoulders
in front. At the back they reveal nothing
but a pair of heels. On the Avhole, however,
except for the epidemic of small hats (about
the size of Easter buns), and the crowd —
the stands were packed like overweight her-
ring barrels —Saturday’s race meeting was
by the weather put out of bounds as a dress
parade.
A few years ago women were tolerated but
not encouraged in the official stand at Rand-
wick, though one or two got in with a
squeeze. Now, they swarm there —at a
price. The A.J.C. makes a lot of money out
of this eyrie (the bulk of which goes to
patriotic channels), and those who stand by
its portal on a big race-day watching the
over-dressed Moneybags family crowd in, have
the satisfaction of feeling that, at least, it’s
all helping to win the war.
Over from Maoriland. Mr. Greenwood,
owner of Biplane and Gloaming; and the
Steads, of Christchurch. Owner Lowry
(Desert Gold is his big current advt.) is also
in Sydney.
Excellencies have been coming and going
during the last week. The new Governor of
Fiji, Mr. Cecil Rodwell, reached Sydney on
his way to the dependency. He’s escaped a
title so far, and carries only a C.M.G. as
excess luggage.
Lieut.-Colonel Reynolds, recently a staff
officer of the Australian Flying Corps, is
taking over the directorship of military art
at Duntroon.
The house-drive for Dependants’ Day
began the other morning in the Town Hall.
Alderman Richards is lion, organiser of the
raid. The sub-regal lady gummed the first
badge on the main windows of the municipal
entrance. The Day is October 11.
The R.S.Y. Squadron, which had a cyclone
of rain for its patriotic fete in the club
grounds some weeks ago, lent a hand with
the Graythwaite party the other afternoon.
Minister for Repatriation Millcn opened the
proceedings. A new ward for incapacitated
soldiers was the pivot of the fete. A big
cheque is going to bulge the Red Cross hos-
pital finances as a result.
Percy Reason is amongst the Society of
Artists’ exhibitors who have made good, lie’s
the enterprising Victorian, now settled in
Sydney, who started to feel his way as an
artist at the precocious age of 12. His
first studio was a piano packing-case turned
upside down. That was in the Mallee Scrub
country.
The Seventh War Loan is attracting the
small feminine fry, judging by the millinery
that swarms round the Moore-street destroy-
er’s nose every day. The shrill treble “Hear,
hear,” from the women in the crowd, empha-
sises every speaker’s entreaty. Women
arc easily appealed to at any time with a
time-payment scheme, and the easy £1 down
and the rest in 18 months, if you like, is a
good lure in a sound cause. The nation must
have the money.
II on. organisers
Syd Ure Smith and
Hal Eyre have in
hand the preparation
of an album and
something more sub-
stantial for presenta-
tion to artist Julian
Ashton, with the en-
thusiastic support of
the notable teacher’s
students, past and
present. How many
ex-students are scat-
tered in two hemi-
spheres even Ashton
himself will not
attempt to guess.
The president of the
Society of Artists
(the S. of A. show
opens this mid-week in the Education Depart-
ment’s galleries) is just getting back to his old
brisk walk after being slowed down by a
long attack of bronchitis. The artist was
born in England, his mother being an Italian
lady who hoped (in vain) that, her son
would never join the ranks of “the
daubers.” His father died when Julian was
wearing his first knickers. But from him
the boy inherited not only his love of art
but the fine technique which he has passed
on to countless students during the last 30
years. Ashton came to Melbourne as a
young man to David Syme’s monthly, The
'lllustrated Australian News. _ Later,
the Argus offered him the editorship of its
rival magazine. The Sketches, which he
accepted. Amongst other adventures the artist
saw the capture of the remnant of the Kelly
gang. At the end of five years he decided to re-
turn to England ; but he also made ,up his mind
to have a look at Sydney on the way. “That
settled it,” he says. “My wife and I had
rooms in Macquarie-street. When I looked
out of the window in the early morning and
saw the beauty of a waterscape almost
unsurpassed, I said, ‘Why, this' is the
loveliest place I’ve ever seen in my life.
We can’t leave it.’ ” For a time Ashton
was president of the old Art Society of
N S. Wales; but he left it. “My protest
was, and is, against allowing the amateur
element to weaken the professional side of
artists’ serious work,” he affirms —but with-
out bitterness. The Society of Artists,
founded by Julian Ashton, and of which lie
is president, has a big future ahead of it.

Singing in Eng-
land, chiefly in vaude-
ville under the stage
name of Loraine
West, is the Juno-
esque Sydney _ girl
whose photo is inset.
We knew her as
Zara, daughter of
Rabbi Wolinski, of
Sydney. Brother Joe
(the artist) took her
to London about six
years ago, and placed
her for study in the
London School of
Opera. She is still
taking lessons in the

and is making
her own way on the professional stage.

From Brisbane :
When Bulgaria threw in the towel Brisbane blew
every whistle and jangled every bell. A huge crowd
gathered outside the G.P.O. at noon, and listened
to speeches by the Governor, the Premier and others.
Business houses released their employees for a
quarter of an hour, and 1700 school children swelled
the crowd. In the Assembly Premier Ryan an-
nounced the good news amid cheers. “Rule Britan-
nia” was sung, and when that was over Donald
Gunn suddenly began the Anthem in a very high key.
Everybody joined in, so we're not all what the politi-
cal embroilers would have you believe.
Dr. Gilruth, Administrator of the Northern Terri-
tory, is in town at present.
The Brisbane Wool Spinning Guild held its second
annual meeting on Monday night. Lady Goold-
Adams presided, and in place of the usual bouquet
she was presented with a pound of excellent knit-
ting wool, spun by one of the members.
Sylvia Dixon, daughter of the Dixons of
Neaavie, Goomeri, was married last Wednesday to
Dick Dulhunty, son of the late squatter Dulhunty.
Archbishop Donaldson did the knot-tying. The
bride wore a brocaded satin gown, adorned with
old Limerick lace, that had been the property of a
great-great-grandmother. Four pretty maids, Bar-
bara Palmer, Nellie Lawless, Gloria Hughes and
Gwen Dulhunty, wore cream net over silk, finished
with pale lavender sashes. Instead of bouquets they
carried canes topped with lavender peggy-bags
filled with flowers.
Fan, very tired, was, with his colleagues
of the French Mission, lionised by Sydney
journalists the other day at a luncheon in
Farmer’s smoke lounge. The French leader
had such a- bad cold, that he couldn’t
reply to the speeches, particularly D.
D. Braham’s, editor of the Daily Tele-
graph, which was as long in coming to an
end as a circle. . Dr. Siegfried, of the slender
willow-wand figure and intense eyes, spoke
Pau’s thanks in excellent' conversational
English. The man of letters playfully
alluded to journalists as necessaries of life.
“For in France —of course, here it may be
quite another would rather
be attacked in the press than not men-
tioned at all. After the war we shall hope
to find the Australian journalists our real
friends, and trust they will go on mentioning
us as kindly as they do to-day.” Inky Way-
farers, mustered in force, gave the happy hand
to that.
Another motor fatality. This time Mrs.
,T. B. Christian. She was one of Sydney’s
most philanthropic women; an elderly lady
and a widow of the well-known pastoralist
who died not many weeks ago. When the
accident happened Mrs. Christian was on her
way to the Alexandra Hospital (Camper-
down), of which she was a director. Won-
derfully active and alert, it was typical of
the keen brain which helped to guide many
charity movements that she asked to be
taken to the hospital for which she was
bound. She died soon after reaching it. The
deepest sympathy is felt for her family. Mrs.
E. Antill, of the War Chest; Mrs. Morris,
who helps the same cause; and Miss Helen
Christian are her daughters.
Dr. Mary Booth, who has been decorated,
with the 0.8. E., relinquished a flourishing
private practice in Macquarie-street when
the war came so that she could devote all her
time to patriotic work. She was the founder
and is the little' mother of the Soldiers’ ( dub.
amongst numerous other activities for Bill-
jim.
Dorothy Harden, a daughter of the princi-
pal of the Presbyterian Ladies’ College at
Croydon, was married recently in New York.
The fortunate man was William B. Nolan.
Innes-Noad. M.L.C., the plump and kindly
citizen with the cherubic smile, is godpa to
the suggested Welfare Society. This body
proposes to teach young mothers that a “bit
o’ what liis father likes’’ is not the best thing
for little pink toes. Her Ex. is taking a
front place in the new movement.
Mrs. Clunies Ross, a sister of Mrs. Madge
Donohoe, by the way, has lost a fine young
son. He was Captain Egerton Ross, who
recently served with the 2nd King’s African
Rifles, got malaria on active service in Ger-
man East Africa, and was invalided to Eng-
land. He died on September 27 in the Queen
Alexandra Hospital, London.
General Pau was the first man in Sydney
to wear a button struck for Soldiers’ Depen-
dants’ Day. The souvenir was pinned to
his uniform by the Town Clerk, the Mayor,
Joynton Smith, being laid aside for a few
days, partly as the result of over-strain. The
Day is dated October 11.
Not for years has the Town Hall had such
a festive evening as on October 2. That
night the State Gala Concert in honor of
the French visitors had the extra elation of
glorious news from every Allied Front. In
the streets, crowds who swarm like bees
when the horizon-blue uniforms of France
flash past, cheered till the welkin rang (I
don’t know what a welkin is; it appears to
be something like a. firebell or the betting
square at Randwick), while the members of
the Mission threaded their way up the con-
gested Town Hall steps. Inside, the big
municipal barn was gay with bunting, and
tall tree palms reared their fronds in every
available foot of gallery space. A great
audience stood while Verbrugghen’s choir
and orchestra pealed the National Anthem.
Lady Davidson, in floating white drapery
with a glint of diamonds, was the
elegant white moth of the official procession.
Consuls were in plenty, and the audience,
which didn’t take the concert seriously—as
a concert —joyously leapt to its feet for the
Marseillaise and the-national music of the
United States, Belgium, Italy and Japan.
Cupid seems to be working overtime in
Palestine amongst the Cameliers. Major J.
S. Nobbs, of Queensland, recently said “I
will.” Lieut.-Colonel G. F. Langley, of
Melbourne, expects very shortly to lead a
pretty young Cairo girl to the altar ; and now
Major P. Goldenstedt, a Sydney pressman,
late of the 3rd Battalion, A.1.F.. has
arranged to settle down with Sister 11. W.
Clapp, of the 14th Australian General Hos-
pital, Egypt. The lady hails from the banks
of the. Swan.
The Red Cross advertised the other day
for a voluntary woman-worker for Egypt.
I haven’t yet heard whether the crush of
applicants dislocated the traffic near the
society’s lair in Bridge-street.
Even the followers of Confucius are mak-
ing joyful just now. Though old China, or
that small portion of it which sojourns in
Sydney, is' merely expressing its content
that the ohilosopher had another birth-
day—his 2469th or something of the kind —
the glad tumult accords with the wonderful
war news.
Yours affectionately,
VANDORIAN.

The Reason.
HE Duo-Concerto is unlike
other player mechanisms; the
effectiveness of the expression
devices are so radically different
and so pre-eminently simple and
superior to antiquated ideas of
construction, that it stands in a
field alone. Besides, the Duo-
Concerto can and does control
perfect Tone Color, the one thing
that was wanted to make the
player piano an artistic instrument.

My Dear Yarßie, —
Major Harrison, a flying officer, departs
for England about the middle of the month.
Mrs. Harrison and the baby are now estab-
lished under the l’vendergast parental roof
at North Melbourne until they find a place
of their own.
One of Australia’s newest D.F.C.’s is Cap-
tain 11. G. Francis, who left this country
with the record of being the youngest chem-
ist to qualify at Melbourne University.
Matron Isaacs was amongst the nurses
who returned on the last transport. It is
more than two years since she left Mel-
bourne for India. Since then she has been
in charge of a hospital at Salonika.
The Fanning family is celebrating the
return of Major Willie Fanning, who has
been in the thick of it for the last three
years. He was given a cyclonic welcome
when he sailed into the Royal Yacht Club.
The veteran is still in the early twenties.
Dave Doyle, son of Brendon Doyle, of the
Victorian Railways, has been appointed a
major. He began as quartermaster-sergeant
and is still in his early twenties. His proud
dad is a well-known amateur in our Rep.
Theatre productions.
Captain Reggie Power, who has been out
of action since he smashed one leg in
Salonika, is nearing Australia. He will have
a few weeks in his native sunshine before
going back. It is now three years since he
left his sheep acreage. Mrs. Reggie awaits
his return in England, where she is near the
maternal Grey-Egerton lady.
The Edward Carlile knight and his wife
are waiting as patiently as possible to meet
their only surviving son, Medical-Major
Carlile, who is returning invalided. Ilis
only brother fell in action in France.
Two shiploads of troops arrived on Fri-
day, and paraded in a drenching rain. They
were two hours behind schedule becam e of
rough weather. This may have been Hie
reason why the soldiers for other States wore
drafted off so abruptly. The Melbourne rela-
tives and friends of N. S. Wales and Banana-
land men clamored vainly behind barriers at
Spencer-street, but officialdom turned the deaf
ear and noddled its turnip head. The boat
train disgorged its load on one side of a
platform, and the boys were marched straight
into a waiting train on the opposite side. It
might have been better managed, but nobody
expected it to be.
Lieut. Jack Gould-Taylor, a Hawthorn
youngster of 21, who has seen a lot of ser-
vice with the A.F.C., has won the Distin-
guished Flying Cross. Dad Gould-Taylor,
dead these many years, was a Presbyterian
minister who took a deep interest in
mechanics.
Back in Melbourne on short furlough,
Flight-Commander Vernon Worrall (bear-
ing the D.S.C. and Croix de Guerre), of the
Royal Naval Air Service. He is one of the
fighting sons of Methodist parson Henry
Worrall, nowadays of Camberwell.
Melbourne Club’s secretary, Robert Cor-
nish, who passed out suddenly last week,
married the widow of the late Major Inglis.
There were no children from this marriage,
but she had four children by her first hus-
band. She was a daughter of Dr. Tracy, a
late famous Collins-street medico, and a
sister of Mrs. D’Ebro, wife of the architect.
The late Robert’s brother, Alfred, whose wife
was the daughter of the late Judge Noel, is
secretary to the Australian Club.
Carrington, of The Australasian, is
pluckily pulling through an attack of double
pneumonia. He is a young pressman of 84.
Many Melbourne sports boarded the Syd-
ney express at the week-end, bound for
Randwick. Amongst them were Sam Mac-
kay, Bert Clarke, Arthur Cohen, Merson
Cooper, George Allan and Walter Toohey.
Sam Ammess was the head of the table at
a long farewell dinner to Adam Melville,
who by now is installed in the Colonial
Mutual Offices, Sydney. The food was
eaten and the speeches made at the Stock
Exchange Club.
Mina Moore-Tainsh has retired to Sydney
and private life with hubby and baby after it
sudden disposal of her photographic studio
to Ruth Hollick. Ruth made a hobby of
photographing babies and children in their
own homes, but hankered for city premises.
The deal was a sudden inspiration.
The titian-liaired Evans girls are proudly
parading a soldier cousin named Orel. The
young man came all the way from the Malay
Straits to enlist.
The Church of England seems to provide
a comfortable permanent camping-ground
for the families it suits. The sudden death
of Mrs. Lowther Clarke, wife of Melbourne's
Anglican Archbishop, recalls the fact that as
Miss Kemp, daughter of an English canon,
she married Lowther Clarke in 1876, then a
young, newly-fledged curate. Of their three
sons, two are on active service, and the third
is secretary of the Society for the Promotion
of Christian Knowledge—a post which
should be well within the Church’s beneficent
shadow. Melbourne had known the gentle
Englishwoman 15 years when the end came.
The late Mrs. Clarke, wife of the Arch-
bishop, was a valuable help to her husband.
Bishop Moorhouse’s wife did hardly any-
thing in church work. Without the slight-
est warrant she was called a sceptic, though
the daughter of Canon Sale. A large, hand-
some woman, with auburn hair, she, with
her husband, patronised London theatres
after returning from Australia —which was
in keeping with his Gaiter’s support of the
playhouse in Australia.
_ Archbishop Redwood, of Maoriland, is a
visitor here for the preliminary conclave
of all the Australasian R.C. archbishops and
bishops preparatory to the World’s Eucharis-
tic Congress, to be held in Sydney after the
war. Father Robinson adroitly takes advan-
tage of ail this patronage for the opening of
his new Church of the Victories, at Camber-
well. Archbishop Redwood, by the way, is
credited with a knowledge of 13 languages.
He was educated in France, and was a
schoolmate of General Pan’s.
The regular Red Cross worker at Federal
Government House greeted the end of the
exhibition week with relief. The place was
thrown open to visitors, and they trooped
through in hundreds, impeding the work.
Four aviators were the most important
visitors to Flemington on Saturday. They
flew to the course, swooped almost to the
grandstand roof, and one threatened the
judge’s box. As they flew they dropped
white showers of War Loan literature.
The election of the Button Day committee
last Monday roused tempestuous party
storms. Unfortunately the issue was made sec-
tarian. The election result was chaotic inas-
much as it proved a triumph for newcomers
(presumably in search of Empire honors),
while several who had worked the movement
up from its initial success were humped out.
Councillor J. Waxman and Mrs. .fas. Alston
were the only two not on the party card
who were included on the committee of 18.
Frances Woolcott, 0.8. E., who has organ-
ised the movement with such signal success,
was one of the bumped. However, she scored,
being appointed with Mrs. Deakin as Gov-
ernment nominees. The Hennessy dame and
Mrs. J. 11. Herrison were also passed out.
The friends of the blind can help the
funds of the Braille Society by attending
the concerts arranged by Nurse Anne
Murphy and Norman Hoff. The concerts
are given in the hall behind the Blind
Asylum, and the best artists in town supply
the music.
Olive Thompson,
the lady in the pic-
ture, has a fluent
pen for the writing
of dramatic songs.
She brought out a
“song cycle,” which
has force and origi-
nality, and a march-
ing ditty of liers has
helped some of the
boys along. She is
a young Juno, who
played parts in
Melba’s all-girl pro-
duction of classical
opera at the Rep.
Theatre some time
ago.
The Girls’ Training Home is trying to
attract some interest to its needs. The com-
mittee is inviting well-wishers to a linen
tea to-day (Thursday). Mrs. Tyrer is organ-
iser.
Melbourne was over-run last week by a
burly team of flapper basket-bailers from
Sydney. The generous father of a player in
the champion Victorian team entertained
both teams at a theatre night.
The Caulfield Guineas on Saturday will
be run in the regrettable absence of some of
the Very Best People, as the Federal Excel-
lencies are giving a garden party that after-
noon in honor of the French Mission.
The late Canon Drought’s surviving son,
John, M.C., who has been serving with the
R.G.A. since early in the war, has risen to
the rank of major. Anglicans at Toorak have
also been stirred by the news of a pro-
motion nearer home. Their vicar, Archibald
Law, of St. John’s, is now Canon Law.
Leila Doubleday had a soprano to help at
her Thursday concert in the Auditorium. She
was Constance Neville-Johns, a Sydney
singer who had not previously appeared in
Melbourne. Constance looked something
like the pictures of Queen Elizabeth, with her
red hair piled up and bound with pearl
bands. She was clad in white net with
no sleeves to speak of. Leila’s simple lilac
gown was very effective. Hal Elvins played
divinely, and his small bald spot shone like
a close-fitting halo. There was a full house,
with the balconies and galleries shut off.
This photo is of
Victor Nelson Hood,
the experienced aide,
secretary and friend
of Governors. He
has “attended” Excel-
lencies in N. S.
Wales, Bananaland,
South Australia, and
Westralia, and has
practically become an
Australian. lie is
wedded to the Sunny
South; otherwise lie
is a hopeless bach-
elor. After many
years of work he
has just gone off for
a 12 months’ holi-
day. after being fare-
welled with a score
of dinner-parties and lunches too numerous
to mention in one issue. The traveller goes
by way of Java. Borneo, Singapore, Penang
and Rangoon. Lafayette took this picture.
Leila Doubleday and Constance Neville-
Jchns drew another solid audience on Satur-
day night. The Felsteads, the Neils and
Baillieus were in force. Fritz Hart exhibited
considerable interest in the proceedings.
Leila fiddled in pink charmeuse with the silk
shadow lace, and Constance sang in palest
blue tulle.
Melba is to sing at the Northcote Orches-
tral Concert in November. She is doing
this to help the Northcote Fund. Most
people seem to think the fund has plenty of
money, but it is truly hard-up.
From Adelaide: —
Stella Power’s concert, postponed from the previ-
ous Monday, was the final effort of the September
Red Cross appeal, and it added £2OO to the funds.
Both Stella and pianist De Bourguigncm got a big
reception. Melba, in response to one of the many
encores, appeared on the platform with her protegee.
When the tumult subsided she explained that she
was there as “accompanist only,” and stayed at the
piano for two songs. The Dame has promised to
come back early in December and sing for the
Red Cross.
Adolph Brose, who “coift’ed” the heads of half
Adelaide in his time, died lately at South Terrace,
aged 61. He was the father of Henry Brose, a
Rhodes Scholar, and now a prisoner of war in
Germany.
The Josiah Symons have had news that their son,
Lieut. C. J. B. Symon, M.C., of the Coldstream
Guards, is in hospital at Rouen.
The S.P.C.A. is making an appeal for waste binder-
twine for fly-nets for Australian horses on active
service, and also for workers to plait them. Similar
veils made last year in Victoria and N. S. Wales
proved so much better than the ordinary service veil
that the Defence. Department is now asking for a
supply of 50,000. The veils are easy to make if you
want to make them.
The Unley Unit of the Red Cross held its annual
meeting on Wednesday, with Lady Galway in the
chair, and gave an encouraging account of its year's
activities. Its shop alone, which divides its profits
amongst Red Cross and trench comforts funds, cleared
£SOO in its first 12 months’ operations.
The Royal South Australian Yacht Squadron said
good-bye to Captain Burford at Port Adelaide on
Thursday evening. On the same evening ex-M.P.
MacGillivray and his wife were guests of honor of
the National Party.
The Adelaide Art Club’s second exhibition was
opened by Lady Galway on Thursday afternoon.
Some fine work in pictures, leather-work and china-
painting was on view. Will Ashton. Miss Lily
Anderson, Miss Maida Wright, Miss Giles and Miss
Mary Grigg were the chief exhibitors.
The Soldiers’ Home League struck a bleak, wintry
day for its Button Day on Friday, hut the shivering
collectors managed to rake in well over £l3OO.
Sister G. M. Collins. A.A.N.S., a Lake
Tyers (Gippsland) girl, who has recently
been in Salonika, has agreed to marry Lieut.
Ligieri, an English aviator now in Egypt.
Sybil Mould, an ardent, war-worker, has
received a diamond half-hoop from Raymond
Fethers, of Caulfield, back from fighting the
Turk. Sybil is the younger daughter of the
Arthur Moulds, of Elsternwick.
Mona Ferguson, who is one of the elegant
eight dancers in “Oh, Boy,” at Her
Majesty’s, has got an engagement-ring. It
came from Paul Plunket and heralds an
early matrimony. Plunket, a tall and
angular young actor, is at present in Lon-
don nursing a wound after a spell at the
Front.
Lieut. Charlie Armytage, second son of
Norman, has married Pamela Tuston,
daughter of a London doctor. Charles
was IS when he left Geelong Gram-
mar to enter Broadmeadows camp. The
Armytages are making a habit of wedding
English girls. Cousin Steve Fairbairn
married Nancy Cunard, daughter of the
British-American shipping man. Cousin
Bean followed up with an alliance with a
Hastings damsel. She is coming to Aus-
tralia next month.
Marie Tempest got a surprise in Mel-
bourne recently. She was invited to dinner
in Toorak, and her taxi took her in at a
familiar gate, dropped her at a familiar
front door, and she walked into a house
which was a duplicate of her own in Eng-
land. It was the Fred Fairbairns’ house,
built just before the war. Mrs. Fred saw
the Tempest abode during its owner’s
absence and had it duplicated here. When
she got inside Marie even recognised her own
thatch-grey velvet carpets. The whole house
is carpeted in the one color. The Fairbairns
sold the place some time ago.
Although many persistent “first-nighters’’
were at the Sydney horse carnival, “Busi-
ness Before Pleasure’’ scored a full house at
the Royal on Saturday. Hugh Ward looked
in, and Mrs. Tallis was with him in the
managerial enclosure. In the box below
Mrs. Charlie Wenman had a party, and the
other boxes contained the Brenan sisterhood
and Mrs. Barry Lupino. Rosie Parkes, as
a film vampire, had a monopoly of the stage
dressing, and was called upon to bestow on
one mime an “Olga Nethersole kiss.” which
lasted 54} seconds by a reliable stop-watch.
This is Rosie’s first big part, and she
received a friendly welcome from those who
knew her as Rosie Wilson. She is the
daughter of Jim Wilson, the veteran race-
horse owner. A few years ago she was the
belle of several Cup seasons.
Prof. Baldwin Spencer takes a gloomy
view of art prospects at Melbourne National
Gallery. He spoke on the subject at a
Lyceum Club meeting the other evening, and
described as “quite incompetent,” from an
art viewpoint, the two committees concerned
in the disbursement of the Gallery’s excep-
tionally rich endowment of £BOOO a year. The
committees have an expert to act for them in
London, but Spencer sees some defects even
in this plan, the trouble with an expert,
according to Spencer, being that he is “apt to
go on one line.” The next expert would favor
another school, and so on, so that “an excel-
lent balance would be attained in about 1000
years.” Depressing, of course; but there is
a gleam of hope in the fact that, within a
couple of hundred years or even less, a good
manv native Australian artists will have
been dead long enough for their genius to be
recognised by local mandarins.
Penleigh Boyd has done good work at his
\v arrandyte studio since his return from
the Front. Much of it is oix view at the
artists’ show in the Athenaeum.
Artist John Shirlow caught some of the
beauties of Sydney on the point of his etch-
ing-needle while on a recent visit, and he is
about to publish a collection of Sydney im-
pressions in book form.
Derbertolis has been dead for many years
now, but some of the hand-made furniture he
built from Australian woods survives and
changes hands occasionally at big prices.
Ihe poor craftsman sold the pieces origin-
ally for “a song,” Derbertolis (he sounds like
an ancient Greek) was a naturalised Aus-
tralian who lived near Drouin (Vic.) and
used wood from the forest round about and
rushes from the creeks and swamps. His
rush-bottomed chairs are things of beauty
and usefulness, and have his name burnt or
carved. underneath. The Lyceum Club has
a precious one or two presented by a mem-
ber. I)r. Helen Sexton (an ardent collector
ot good Australian things) has some other
good samples. Unhappily few people
encouraged the old man, and" the chance was
missed of building up a big Australian in-
dustry. Furniture made of Australian hard-
wood is now very expensive. Stockfelt was
a more recent artist in wood, but his luck
was no better than his predecessor’s. While
Australians paid high for cheap Chinese
work, Stockfelt worked away neglected.
Major MacGregor Knox. M.C., who left
one leg m a British gunpit in France, is
■on ms way back to Australia. His brother.
Colonel Bob, has had three years at the Front.
Another fighting Ivnox sleeps under a
wooden cross in France.
Yours sincerely,

Last week this page remarked that the
most noticeable happening incidental to the Epsom
was tile way in which all the earlier backed nags
had drifted out of notice. This observation was
rounded off by the race, one of these very mokes
transpiring at the right place with an exceptionally
brilliant run, and blowing all the later fancies clean
out. Soon after the Epsom weights appeared Rebus
came into the market, and about six weeks ago was
actual favorite, not much better than 12’s being
available at that stage. tie was backed by his
owner to win a fairly good stake. Then with 9st. 21b.
lie was beaten into second place by Cerise Colors
in the Auburn Handicap, 7 furlongs, at Rosehill on
August 24. There was a good field in that race
(Norbury didn’t get into the first 12), and though
Rebus ran in backward condition the result was
held to leave him no chance in the Epsom. Anyway
he slumped, and though Lemon stuck to his parcels
he did so with a feeling that the horse would do
better in the Metrop. than the mile. Next Rebus
was seen in the Chelmsford Stakes, in which he was
the only one to make an attempt to reach Gloaming
at the end. He gave that celebrity 2ft stone anil
took second money. A week later at Rosehill Rebus
was chopped right out of the Spring Handicap by
Biplane trying to climb over him at the start, and
never got into the hunt behind Panacre. Wherefore
he went more emphatically out of favor for the
Epsom than ever. It is very doubtful if he was
backed for a shilling between then and the day—and
then he certainly was not supported for much more.
His name was hardly written in Judea. Anyone
with real money could easily have got 100’s to 2
and 3 for the asking. Yet two out of Rebus's three
previous runs had been extraordinarily good Epsom
trials, and the horse is one that never yet ran a bad
race, or anything- like a bad one. As he is owned
by a bookmaker it is only fair to say that no horse
has run more consistently than Rebus. He is cer-
tainly the most versatile moke in Australia, and one
jf the very best handicappers ever raced in the
Commonwealth. If a set of handicaps from six
furlongs to two miles was framed to-morrow, how
many horses would be nearer the top in each? isfot
<is many as would beat him in a beauty competition,
anyway.
There were 25 at the barrier this time for the
Epsom. Poitrina was the first to begin, and as Publi-
can, Dame Acre, Panacre and Quaestor were in the
first flight it looked as if the rest of the story could
be told in a few words. The writer followed Pan-
acre for about a furlong and left him about fifth
to try and find The Destroyer. It was an easy job,
for that conspicuous animal had moved leisurely off
and was still well astern. Then he looked to see
how Panacre had been getting on in the interval,
couldn’t find him and didn’t see him again on the
trip. There are allegations that he was well placed
at five furlongs, but so far as the writer could see
Panacre disappeared into the interior of the pro-
cession at seven furlongs, got securely locked up
and stayed there. Meanwhile Publican, Poitrina,
Dame Acre and Cerise Colors had been doing well.
At the turn Dame Acre punctured and left it to the
other three. Cerise Colors actually struck the straight
first, and while Poitrina vanished, Norbury, Fight
Ever -and Quaestor swung into the- fighting-line
with the ex-pony and Publican, and Rebus dropped
from the clouds among them. He had come from
nowhere round the turn like the wind. The pace up
the straight was terrific. Publican was the first that
didn’t like it. He blew out opposite the Leger. At
the distance Norbury, clear of Cerise Colors, Quaestor
and Fight Ever looked almost a certainty. He was
sticking well. But he just hadn’t that little bit left
that tells at the end of a mile. Close behind him
was travelling near along the rails a chestnut -horse
that had unwound some rare finishes to a ltandwiek
crowd before. He caught Norbury 50 yards from the
line, and after a stride or two was leaving him easily.
It was Rebus, winner of last Sydney Cup. He hadn’t
Deen sighted till the turn was reached. “Now, what
do you know about that ?” asked the stunned multitude,
ine of the other. The books felt like giants
refreshed.
The winner had been ridden with a fine nerve and
judgment by Albert Wood. The mile was run in “38,”
and as Rebus had not occurred in the picture at half-
ivay his time oyer the last three furlongs must have
been phenomenal. Apart from the exhibition of
courage and endurance given by Rebus (who pulled
up in remarkably good shape) the showing of Cerise
Colors, a graduate from the ponies and a hard-
working battler over all distances on suburban
courses, was an iroriical reflection upon the miles of
stuff that are written abort “class,” and a cheerful
happening for .punters to r as measurement of their
wisdom. His close fourth, ti- 'far from showing him
not to be “up to Epsom form,” showed him good
enough to have more than a fair chance in any
ordinary year. Saturday’s rary? was horribly fast.
Of the three placed horses in the Epsom two are
described as ( “imp.” Of the three shortest-priced
starters, two', Publican (4’s) i and The Destroyer
(6’s) are importations, the other a local product.
Of these, Publican had every chance, and failed. The
Destroyer looked on from behirid, and just beat one
(Poitrina) home. Panacre ne\ier got clear of the
tangle, and was not in the preliminary dozen to
arrive. There is, after all, nothing much to be sur-
prised at in this. The Epsom: has always been a
calamitous adventure for favorites. The race has
only b'een won twice by the favorite in the last 16
years. During' the same time that animal has been
beaten out of sa place 11 times.
Still considering Rebus: He cost Lemon 350
guineas, which were passed over to Cobram, of W.A.,
who imported the nag and was the importer of
Quinologist. Rebus never ran at two years old. At
three years he won over seven furlongs, in February,
at Hosehill a month after being unplaced in a maiden
event at Canterbury Park (Sydney). He next
transpired at four years, in December, and was
unplaced in a Flying at Canterbury. The following
month—that is January last—he ran third in the
A.J.C. Trial Stakes, 7 furlongs, at Randwick, and was
second in the Highweight Handicap with 9st. 121 b.
to Franzae, 7st. 51b. In March he finished nowhere
in the Autumn Stakes, won by Desert Gold; was just
beaten by Westcourt in the Rawson Stakes at Rose-
hill. In April he won the Sydney Cup (7st. 121 b.),
and was second to Mehi King (Bst. 41b.) with 9st.
in City Tatt'ersall’s Cup. This year he has had two
seconds and a win in four starts.
When Desert Gold struck the straight in the Spring
Stakes with a length to the good, and, easily holding
her own against a run by lvennaquhair, came oil
towards the Leger well in front, the public began to
laugh. By the time she was near the distance the
joke was over and a great silence prevailed. Another
horse had arrived in the picture—Poitrel. He was
galloping with great resolution, and O’Shea, scenting
danger behind, started riding the mare. A hundred
yards from the post Poitrel closed on her. They
raced almost even past, the stand, the Maorilunder
with her head just poking out,Poitrel gaining inch after
inch. Just at the death, when it looked as if there
was going to be a repetition of the Reputation-St.
Carwyne dead heat of three years before, Bracken
gave the horse a last, desperate push, so to speak,
and took the bacon on the last stride. The judge said
“half a head.” The clock stopped at 31 —a record
for the race and the distance. It was a great
struggle—one of the sort racing men will talk about
for as long as they last. Poitrel had done what
nobody believed him capable of doing, and did it in
a brilliant way. Bracken rode the race of his life
and disposed of the idea that he is best over short
courses.
Poitrel beat the mare fair arid square. There can
be no possible doubt .about that, for even though
allowance may be made for Desert Gold having been
made more use of than seemed necessary over the
first part, the fact that Poitrel was seven horses back
at half a mile and that the mare was then two
lengths clear of the others more than counterbalances
the other consideration. How good a stayer he is
was shown by the run he opened up from that stage.
It is not likely that anyone believed such a run
would be sustained. But it was. Perhaps O’Shea
took matters too much for granted at the turn/ Had
he pushed the mare along a little there the story
might have been different. But even if this is
assumed there is ’no getting away from it that he
had plenty of warning and that the mare had every
chance. She responded in the most generous way.
There was no sign of faltering, and the merit of her
performance could not have been greater had she
been a winner. It was the third time Desert Gold
had beeii beaten in Australia. Each time it hap-
pened she was only an inch or two out, and the one
in front had'to set up record time for the race to
beat her.

Maoriland owners have taken the A.J.C.
Derby four times in five years. Gloaming’s win on
Saturday was the third in succession, Biplane and
Kilboy having appropriated the stake in ’l7 and ’l6.
To celebrate the occasion, apparently, the Maori-
landers were first, second and third and a Maoriland-
bred colt came next. Gloaming stayed the distance
well, and though it was not much of a field he beat,
looked at from a Derby point of view, and he was
tiring a bit at the. end, he won easily in “33J” —
the fastest Derby with one exception ever run in the
Commonwealth. The exception is the “325” of the
flying Noctuiform in 1905. For about a mile the
two Welkins were out in front. Outlook burst so
suddenly at this stage as to make it almost a cer-
tainty that he will never go any further to get back
the £5OOO paid for him last year. Gloaming then
went on alone and won without being asked to argue
the point. Woorawa had been bumped half a dozen
lengths back at six furlongs, and never got within
reach of the leaders. Dick Meagher was done with
at the turn, though up to that stage he had been
doing well. The others were all dog-tired. Fin-
mark struggled in second, and Kilmocn, who was
perhaps doing his best at the end, turned up just
before Almoner. Private King looked susceptible of
improvement, and up to the straight ran promisingly.
But it. is more than doubtful whether out of the
whole bunch there will be a distance w.f.a. horse to
run next season, with the single possibility of
W.oorawa.
The dubious .calibre of this year’s Derby field was
matched by the mournful circumstance that for the
Clibborn Stakes, on the second day, a w.f.a. event
for thre.e-year-olds, nine only three horses
were found at the barrier and two of these were
Maorilanders. There is something almost tragic in
this —that N. S. Wales with a multitude of horses ,at
the stud, where races for two-year-olds are filled .to
overflowing that only one three-year-old could be
discovered to run at w.f.a. for' a good stake. And
the race itself was even more tragic for, the local
animal (Carbern) ran a very bad last, Killowen easily
settling the other Maorilander Almoner who con-
spicuously shirked the final controversy. Soon after
the Clibborn Stakes had been run came the Breeders’
Plate, for two-year-olds. The difference was simply
horrible. For this event there were 21 starters!
Among the collection there were some beautiful
young horses, too. Of these it is safe to say that 50
per cent, will be soon on the serapheap. Some of.
them were so green they couldn’t take the turn. At
least a dozen of them would be near-about champions
if held over for another year. The race fell to Bun-
della, a smart-looking colt by Tressady from Perdita,
trained by Scully; with Tambaroora, another Tres-
sady next, and Battlewrack, a Malstgr, third. Rose-
tree, a strikingly good-looking prad of the Rose-
worthy tribe, was fourth. With luck and good
treatment this animal may some day be noticed
again.
Poitrei’s sensational performance on Saturday
brought him swiftly into the betting for the Metrop.
And after a big punter had unloaded himself on
Judea in the interests of Lingle, that handsome and
often disappointing horse was at about a fourth of
the odds available an hour or two earlier. It was
one of the most comprehensive plunges made in a
short time at Randwick for many years—and it didn’t
come off. At the end Kennaquhair was at 5 to 2,
Poitrel at 3’s, Lingle 6’s and 7’s, with Estland and
Publican 14’s, Rebus 16’s, The Destroyer 20’s, Arch
Marella 33’s —and 29 starters. Poitrel never had a
hope. He was knocked backwards at the first turn
and stayed there, obviously suffering from the effects
of his tremendous effort against Desert Gold. From
the mile to six furlongs the field straggled over
nearly a furlong of the course, with the chances, if
they ever had any, of nearly a score of the runners
already extinguished. Having apparently derived
great benefit from a slow beginning and leisurely
passage in the Epsom, The Destroyer leaped from the
tapes like a scalded eat, and at 10 furlongs was clear
of Publican. At a mile he was two lengths out and
travelling so comfortably as to suggest him staying
there. Meanwhile Quaestor was third, and Dick
Meagher sixth, followed by Rebus with Bee, East-
court, Arch Marella, Prince Yiridis, Ivennaquhair and
Lingle. The Destroyer was still in front at the
turn, and here Rebus, who had been galloping on, got
a bump and retired, and as others disappeared astern
Prince Yiridis, Arch Marella, Ivennaquhair and
Lingle pushed themselves forward. Before the Leger
was reached The Destroyer vanished into the wreck-
age. For a moment Prince Viridis seemed possible.
In the next, Arch Marella cut him down. At the
distance Ivennaquhair reached out for the front, and
beating off Arch Marella without much effort drew
clear by nearly three lengths. Lingle, who got
buried at the beginning, and had an adventurous
passage all the way round and not much luck over
the last part, was finishing faster than anything
else once he got clear and just beat the Prince for
third. The race was run in “314,” which equals
Cagou’s record for the Metrop. of five years ago.
On the whole, Ivennaquhair had an easy win, and the
public profited by what happened. McLachlan was
put on top at the last moment. Barnett, who had
previously ridden the horse was a looker-on. Per-
haps the way in which Kennaquhair sprinted after
Desert Gold in the first couple of furlongs of the
Spring Stakes accounted for this.
* * * *
According' to the book the result of the
Metropolitan is a fairly reliable guide to the final
stages of the Melbourne Cup. If the general rule
is to hold good this year—a point on which the
writer has many doubts—Lingle can be looked for in
the Flemington picture. He was finishing particu-
larly well in the Metrop. On the figures incidental
to handicapping Arch Marella must have a big
chance at Flemington. He has 7st. 31b. in the Mel-
bourne Cup. He carried Bst. into second place in
the Metrop.—and, according to Dempsey, had his
chances of winning heavily discounted by interference
at the top of the straight when going well. If
Dempsey is right and the book holds good, then
Arch Marella must be given a great chance in Mel-
bourne. Kennaquhair’s win raises his weight in the
Cup to 9st. He may be equal to the job, for he is a
top-hole performer; but again the book protrudes and
says that 9st. is easier to lose with than to win
under. This weight would put Kennaquhair 51b.
above Poitrel, and this page is not prepared to be
enthusiastic about Ivennaquhair on that basis. The
race for the Metrop. proves nothing on the point.
Poitrel had been put to a test of the most searching
kind two days before, when not in his best form
either, and in the Metrop showed that he ought not
to have been asked any questions on Monday. If
Poitrel trains on there are more unlikely things to
happen than for him to be thereabouts at Fleming-
ton. He will “get the distance” anyway. Mean-
while Desert Gold was not in the Metrop, remember.
Started fit and well in the Melbourne Cup this page
would expect to read of hurried proceedings.
* * * *
Tile Maorilanders left Rosehill a week
before as happy as gravediggers, and they emerged
from the first two days of the A.J.C. J meeting looking
no more hilarious than before. One or two of them
looked as if they were thinking about home. The
reason, of course, was the happening in the Spring
Stakes what time Desert Gold went down, and sub-
sequent occurrences in the Derby, the Clibborn Stakes,
the Metrop., the S'quatters’ Handicap. They staked
heavily on Desert Gold. Then, though some of
them backed Gloaming, others went baldheaded on
Finmark, one conspicuous individual almost taking
his boots off in the rush. In the Clibborn Stakes
some went for Killowen, but the Finmarkers came at
Almoner in a great hurry, and tumbled into the
soup again. Before the Squatters’ Handicap they
were busy taking evens at 6 to 4 Kilmoon, and that
turned out a bloomer, too. In the Metrop. Estland
carried a solid wad from over the Tasman, and at
no _ stage looked like recovering it. Up to the
beginning of the week Maoriland hadn’t commenced
to get the spoil together.
The Hand wick course appears to be getting
tremendously fast. At the A.J.C. meeting the Derby
was run in next-to-record time; Lord Nagar covered
two miles oyer hurdles in 3min. 40fsec. ; Rebus took
the Epsom in “38” ; Poitrel perpetrated “31” for a
mile and a half in the Spring Stakes ; Baltic Sea did
the seven furlongs Kensington Handicap in “26.”
Kennaquhair’s time for the Metrop. has never been
beaten. In the Spring Stakes Desert Gold ran the
last mile in 1.40 and the final six furlongs in
What'Poitrel did the last six furlongs in can only
be guessed at. Certainly not under “144” and possi-
bly “14,” because he was well back.
* *■ * *
Wolaroi seems to be getting his gallop
back. If he does get it he will be a very swift horse
to beat in any field. He won the Shorts, six furlongs,
at Ilandwick •on Monday like 1 a gentleman, running
the distance with 9st. 71b. in j 34. And remember
Wolaroi can do a mile and a half, "too.
* iy. * , * *
The argument between Desert Gold and
Biplane is never likely to start. . Anyway Biplane
went wrong last , week, was scratched for all engage,-
ments, _ and will certainly not race again for a long
time —if he ever does. The trouble is in one of the
forelegs. This probably accounts for the habit the
horse recently developed of leaving his ground on
the track, and for his disinclination to jump off at
Rosehill the other day. He was a great money-
spinner while he lasted.
*****
“Cleido”: Recent mention of a jockey
undergoing a severe waste to ride opens up an inter-
esting subject. “Making weight” is a department of
a jockey’s business which could do .with a lot more
attention and study from them than it gets. If a boy has
to get rid of a few pounds of meat his one idea seems
to be to rush off the avoirdupois irrespective of what
condition he is left in. This is not only a dangerous
practice, but it defeats the object of the waste,
which is not only to make a certain poundage, but
to arrive at the scales in fit condition to do his
work. The methods generally adopted are (1)
an excessive number of Turkish baths, (2) starva-
tion, (3) swallowing medicine, and (4) taking exer-
cise under a number of sweaters, in furtherance of
the perspiration idea. Singly or collectively, these
methods will certainly reduce bodily tissue. Simi-
larly they will, unless very intelligently directed,
reduce strength and vitality, as well as leave one
open to bad after-effects. I have seen boys practi-
cally carried from the horse’s back to weigh in, and
in one or two cases faint after a severe race. It is
a moral certainty that in these instances the boys
were not of much assistance to the nags. Yet, given
the necessary knowledge, a boy ought to be able to
make any weight within reason, say seven or eight
pounds below normal, without any npp;eeiable loss
of strength. A fortnight would he all the time
needed. Correct dieting (there will be no full
feeling after meals) should play the leading part in
the programme. Exercise is ail very well, but 100
much of it uses up energy. Boys on ‘'making weight”
stunts could do a lot worse than place themselves
under a good physical-training expert or eomoetent
medical man.

Owing to E. W. Warren, (holder) and
Hackett (runner-up) dropping out, this year’s Maori-
land amateur billiard championship was decided by
H. Siedeberg (Dunedin) and W. Tucker (Welling-
ton). Siedeberg won by 846 in 2000 up. Last year
Warren’s surplus was 1067 —one of the most substan-
tial in the play for the title.

Jack T. Barnett, who crossed the line at
38 at Parramatta (N.S.W.), last week, was in the
front rank of Australian football. Under the Rugbv
Union he tripped with Jim McMahon’s “Wallabies”
through England, Wales and America in 1908, and
played against Maoriland and Queensland. In 1909,
he went into the ltugby League group of representa-
tive football. He wore the Newtown colors.
A little light on the difference between
N. S. Wales senior and junior athletics surrounded'
the Australian Handicap (120 yards) at Sydney
Eight-Hour Sports on Monday. Noel Hathaway
(Cleveland-street), one of the best of school sprinters,
leniently treated with six yards, was generally sus-
pected of having a grip on the trophy ; but State
champion W. W. Hunt (scratch), in a tine finish,
broke the tape ahead of Hodginson and Hathaway.
Hunt did the stretch in 12sec.—the only record of
“evens” in amateur sport for a long stretch. Hunt was
also busy last week-end among the Redfern Harriers,
winning the 100 yards (10 l-10sec.), the broad jump
and arriving second in the 220 yards. There is no
reason to doubt that he is still the speediest citizen
in N. S. Wales.

“Bill R.”: Tell “Azack” (B. 2G/9/T8)
that if he waits long enough on the coastal area,
from which he says the quail have migrated, he will
notice the birds coming back. The quail is not
migratory, but seeks for itself and brood the protec-
tion afforded by long grass. After any period of
drought the quail season brings no joy to the mur-
derer vyith his gun and dog. The birds have trekked
to more favored localities. But they return with the
good seasons. On the Monaro country during and
after the droughty times of the. later ’eighties they
were absent for years. They came back a year or
two ago, and there being no advocates of race suicide
among them—they rear up to three families of 10 or
a dozen in a season —the plains are swarming again
as in the days of old.
* * * *
“Nor” West” : My observation on the sub-
ject of quail migration mentioned by “Azac” (B.
26/9/’18) is that the rainfall has a lot to do with
it. The quail appear to regularly migrate to some
districts and to others only periodically, according to
the wetness and growth of certain shrubs on the
seeds of which they feed. After the great drought
1902 quail came in myriads to the north-western
plains. Some bred there and stayed about for some
years, but disappeared during the frequent dry
spells. They have come back regularly during the
last four or five years, but a peculiar phase of their
migration occurred this year. The birds came as
usual to the plains about Moree, but stayed only for
about a fortnight. Then they disappeared. The
season in the early part of this year was similar to
last, although rain came a bit earlier. However
something was out of gear thereabouts, as the birds
were reported to be in great abundance on the south-
ern Darling Downs. Probably they went there from
Moree. Anyhow, they seem to know by instinct
where the right tucker is. During the wheat season
quail are fairly plentiful in the north-western wheat-
fields. They stay in the paddocks till the harvest is
over and then clear out. Some fine morning “Azac”
will wake up to find that the little wanderer is back
on the coast again apd read about him deserting the
tablelands. It is all a matter of refreshments.

“Edo”: Who says that Kalgoorlie and
Boulder are stone-broke after this? The other day
the two towns had each a three-days’ racing carni-
val. Although war conditions have shut down or
quietened most of the mines, the racing clubs between
them took over £4500 at the gates, and more than
£55,000 went through the tote. On top of this, a
proprietary trotting club had three evening gather-
ings with over £7OOO through the machine. A host
of bookmakers look well fed.

“Bill . Bowyang”: Rarely does a range
marksman make a good sniper. I’ve known chaps on
a range score bulls by the dozen, yet they were
failures when placed in a sniper’s possy on Gallipoli.
Billy Sing, who received a D.C.M. for his remark-
able sniping at Anzac’ was a rotten shot on the
range in Egypt; and it was the same with Riorden,
Cassidy and Smart and others who used to drill holes
through Abdul when he became inquisitive and put
his head above the trenches. I’ve known kangaroo-
shooters who were topside at the game in Banana-
land miss Jacko time 1 after time. It’s all in the
nerve, and there’s a big difference between hitting a
target or an animal to drilling a hole through an
armed fellow-man.

taken of communications insufficiently stamped.
Name and address must appear on the MSS. No
liability is undertaken re contributions volun-
tarily submitted; and no MS. will be returned
unless stamps accompany.
Ybned: Afraid you couldn’t get at
them by direct allusion, but you might reach
them indirectly... .D.W.0.: Thanks; but we’ve
seen the yarn before somewhere.... Thos. H. N.:
Good luck to the venture. .. .M.E.W. (or as near
as the initials can be understood) : You say, “I think
Australia hardly yet realises what she owes to
George Reid.” You’re quite light, hut this is no
time to be vindictive... .Dry as Dust: Are you
sure there’s nothing wrong with you at the old
address ?... .8.P.J.: The music is better than the
grammar; but we don’t “All hail” anybody here
except the Paper Controller.... E.M.: Get to grips
with something real. .. .H.M.: Bad verse to cele-
brate so fine a record... .M.W.C.: The verse
wouldn’t be a tribute D.P.M.: There’s promise
in it. Write of things you know. .. . F. 8.8.: Dreary
narration... .E..T.G.: No bite in it....Chokera:
“More” and “saw” may make a rhyme, but not in
George-street. . . .8.5.: You go one worse. “Adven-
tures” rhymed with “trenches” and “cheers” with
“Armentieres.” Think it over after prayers,...
R.C.P.: One held for inquest.. . .M. 8.: Not near.. . .
G. : Triolet misses.... Willow: Not enough meat
and no bones... .C..T.M.: “Pat” doesn’t make a
yarn... .R.E.: Poor verse on well-worn subjects.
But it came in handy. A Freetrader came in and
we handed it to him... .M. 0.: Pretty lame....
N.A.E.: Not up.... Bellerive: “A Ex-Convict's
Story” misses by reason of being a bit short: —
A chisel and saw were found in my hag,
Which belonged to my master’s son.
And for tools stolen a week before,
1 was charged as the guilty one.
1 was a victim of a enemy’s plot,
But my plea was of no avail,
Tlie jury found me guilty,
And the Judge sent me to gaol,
The wife for who I daily slaved,
A woman above my station.
Took advantage of my disgrace,
And obtained a seperation,
She believed the same as others, bad,
And I will beareth till I die,
The brand of criminal in the eyes of men,
But not to my God on high.
.... A.C.A.D.: Not as good as we would like. (P.S.
—Nothing ever is.) ... .E.M.L.: No good—but some
of the dailies might like it...,K.W.: It's an awful
production... .Nip: Narrowly misses quotation as a
shocking example... .A.R.T.: We have had 20 better
on the same theme. Sometimes we’re pleased when
Webster’s mails don’t come to hand. .. . D.E.N.:
Take it away and read it to a bishop. No bishop
has a punch.... R.D.L.: Melt it into a par....
N.C.: Doesn’t grip. .. .E.F.G.: No humor.... J.S.S.:
Won’t d 0... .H.G.L.: You didn’t succeed in extract-
ing the fun....A.A.: Write about something von
are in touch with... .Aquoui: Honest fairies would
never stand for those names. Imagine Puck between
a Dilhvinia and a Hardenbergia... .F.W.S.: A good
sample of what we don’t want.. .. Lay-to: Too long
a preface; and you don’t make clear what happened.
. ...F.E.Iv.: Starts fairly and tails off to nothing.
. ...H.F.W.: Report the matter to headquarters....
11.8. N.: Re-hash without improvement. Been printed
by all god-fearing newspapers daily for four years.
. ...L.R.: One line has a distinction all its own:
“Saliva strung in ropes of gluttonous greed for blood
and bones.”.... A.E.L.: Bad rhymes; lumpy metre;
meaning not clear. .. .V.T.K.: Not up.... Plodder:
Bad rhyme in first stanza. The rest fair but with
no fresh note \.P.: Strike a new idea. .. .O.B.:
Australia has had tributes, but never one like this:—-
Oh ! This great and loving country of mine,
How it thrills me through and through ;
To be in a country where it's always sunshine.
Give me Australia’s sunny sunny blue.
Tn this loving country of ours,
Where the sun is ever bright;
I lay and frolic for hours,
And often in the moonlight.
To be in a country so loving and free,
One never knows until one’s crossed the seas;
There I would remain and ever like to lie,
To lie under the beautiful old gum-trees.
In this country so lovely and sweet scented,
As the honeysuckle binds round the old gum-trees;
Everything looks as if it had been painted,
To hear the birds chatting, and humming of bees.
... .Mon C.: Too unpleasant.. . . R.R.: They don’t
strike u 5.... C.J.W.: Heavy verse full of common-
place tags. .. .C. 11.8.: Not suitable... .Patrius: Not
up... . D.C.: Doesn't cheer us... . W.J.: “Purling
Mere” sounds more like an intoxicated traction
engine than a mountain stream.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
A.8.C.: Is the reader supposed to he a fly on the
ceiling?. . . ,F.K.: Very immature... .Ruby G.: Crude
drawing and stale gag. Next week send us a stale
drawing and a crude gag'.... Tom L.: You chopped
them out, and then we threw them out. Let 'em
rest n0w....81eh: No, thanks to two of them. No,
without any thanks for the kilted Scotchman....
A. Casey: You’re young, or vour idea of drawing
i5....H.H.: Too scratchy... .S. A.: The piebald’s
markings look as if they had been touched up by a
camouflage expert... ,H.C.: All right; let if, go at
that. .. .A.8.C.: It won’t do, young Alphabet....
H. : It doesn’t brighten the outlook... .C.C.:
You’ve invented a new sort of skeleton, and it
doesn’t look as if it would be of much use. Skele-
tons have very desultory habits, anyhow... . Woodi-
eus: They fail... .E.M.8.: Miniature sketch going
home. ... D.D.: Designing tapestries is your proper
job... .Martin: Unsuitable.
Things are rapidly growing no better. The
supply of ships belonging to other people to
carry goods for us has diminished more than
one-half since the war began, and the other
half is fading. Great Britain was induced
with difficulty to renew its contract to buy
our copper for another six months; looking
ahead it probably thinks that copper which
we can’t deliver is as useless as wheat that
we can’t deliver. The Government threatens
to supervise second-hand chaff-bags, for if
there are insufficient ships to bring along the
new bag the old one must be nursed like a
sick child. In reply to a terrified inquiry the
man in charge said he didn’t think the last
regular mail service save one would be
stopped, but he wasn't so cocksure as one
might have wished. Certain mementoes pro-
mised to the mothers of dead soldiers are
still postponed for lack of imported material.
And it is possible that preachers may have
to hold forth extempore and save the paper
they usually write their sermons on.

—the perfect leather substitute.
This is an exact replica of leather, with the same
grains and the same colourings. It has all the charm
of leather but costs only one quarter the price and is
better in every way. It wears better, does not crack or
peel and is unaffected by stains or grease, and is germ and
insect proof. It gives years of service and never gets
shabby, as it can be washed if soiled.
For all upholstering — furniture, motor cars, railway
carriages, etc. —it is the ideal material.

Have You Had Influenza?
There are certain disorders such as influenza
that especially debilitate and make the body
an easy prey for more dangerous diseases.
Ask those who have had the influenza regard-
ing the present condition of their health and
most of them will answer: “Since I had in-
fluenza I have never been well.” They still
have profuse perspiration, the persistent
weakness of the limbs, the disorganised diges-
tion, shortness of breath and palpitation of
the heart caused by the thin-blooded condition
in which influenza almost always leaves it£
victim after the fever and influenza have sub-
sided. They are, furthermore, at the mercy'
of relapses and complications, often very seri-
ous. In an attack of influenza there is ft
rapid thinning of the blood, and not until the
blood is built up again is complete health
restored.
Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills quickly make the
blood rich and red, drive out the lingering
germs from the system and transform
despondent influenza victims into cheerful,
healthy men and women.
Try the pills for any form of debility
caused by thin blood.
All chemists sell Dr. Williams’ Pink Puls.
Get a box to-day and begin at once to regain
your health.
“Diseases of the Blood” is a booklet full
of useful information. 'So is the pamphlet

It Works
Wonders on the
Car, Too
Not only is John-
son's Prepared Wax
a boon to the house-
wife —protecting her
furniture, piano,
gramophone, and
woodwork with a -
beautiful and enduring dustproof polish—
but it works wonders on the motor car, too.
produces a hard, dry, glasslike polish of great beauty
and durability on any finished surface. It forms
a thin protecting coat over the varnish, adding years
to its life and beauty. It covers up mars ana
scratches —prevents checking—sheds water and
makes a wash last twice as long.
Johnson’s Prepared Wax contains no oil —does not
become sticky in warm or damp weather and im-
parts a surface so hard and dry that dust cannot
adhere to it.
Johnson’s Prepared Wax is but one of the John-
son Products which includes Johnson’s Cleaner for
use on motor cars that are greasy, mud freckled
and stained; Johnson’s Carbon Remover for carbon
clogged engines and Johnson’s Radiator Cement for
leaky radiators.
They are obtainable at all good dealers.

“Du°lio”: Try this; it’s a personal experi-
ence. One day our outfit came out of the line
for a spell, and while we were getting our
wind permission was granted to spend a lew
hours at B , a fairly large and well-known
French seaport. Coming from what we nau,
it was a real eye-opener to see a streteh o
clean white beach, and we felt like kids just
out of school. It was an effort to keep back
the veil of delight. We started to trudge
along the sand, and all went well until we
crossed a duckboard leading down from the
esplanade to the water’s edge. We had
barelv hit the other side when a military
policeman rushed up excitedly and ordered
us back, as if we had committed saciifigi.
That part of the beach was "‘reserved tor
officers.”
“Beryl” : Just before the Beersheba show
we found ourselves playing secondary parts
in a military melodrama. We had started a
bio- dump out in the wilds, and aftei about
four davs’ work someone scratched his head
and asked what was between us and Abdul.
Nobody seemed to know or bother, and pre-
sently the commandant guessed we’d better
make sure, and started questioning the near-
est infantry brigade. The brigade referred
him to —— Division, where they would hardly
believe that there was such a thing as a
dump out where we were. It took some time
to convince them that we really were on the
spot. A couple of hours later we were just
having a spell and enjoying the view when
up marched a company of infantry, with
three nice little boys from London com-
mand. “We heard you’d got the wind up,
says the senior, “so we’ve come to look after
you !”
The demand of the Hun agents in Aus-
tralia that the Empire should propose peace
without indemnities or annexations, and
that if it refuses Australia should seek to
coerce it by withdrawing its assistance, is
loaded in both barrels. It is really a device
for breaking up the Alliance. The I.W.VV.
Government of Russia proposed exactly the
same thing, and when the other Allies re-
jected the idea it drew out on its own, as
Britain would, of course, be expected to do
if it made the same proposal and met with
the same refusal. But Britain and Russia are
different propositions. A mere hint from
Britain of retirement —the withdrawal of
its army, its fleet, its munitions, its money,
its protection of the food supplies and the
reinforcements from the U.S.—would stam-
pede the Alliance. Italy came into the war
avowedly for annexations —it wanted the lost
Italian provinces and the lost city of Trieste.
France came in under compulsion, but it is
in partly that it may annex its lost provinces
of Alsace-Lorraine. If there was a possi-
bility that Britain would cut off its aid and
let out the Hun fleet to cut oft' American aid,
there would be little for the other pair to do
but cave in. There would be peace on easy
llun terms. Later the Hun would break the
treaty as he did the treaty with Russia, and
proceed to plunder France and Italy indivi-
dually. The Alliance would be hard to recon-
struct, and it would be a broken-hearted
makeshift at best. Britain might not come
in again. The United States would probably
refuse to touch any league to which Bull
the Traitor, who had marooned its army in
Flanders, was a party. The proposal which
the Perth Labor Conference adopted, and on
which Laborites are now requested to vote,
has the mark of the cloven hoof all over it.
By the office alderman: —
Some Lord Mayors make the reception business a
specialty. Thus Sydney’s Joynton Smith gave a wel-
come at the Town Hall to Oliver Bainbridge, once
of the Ma State, described as a lecturer and author
and the leader of a scientific expedition to “Papua
and the various islands in the Pacific.” He said that
O. Bainbridge had travelled upwards of 300,000
miles during the last 20 years. Alderman Richards
said that Oliver B. had come here to “assist in the
development of Australia’s stupendous resources” and
sought to “draw firmer and closer the bonds of
empire,” and Alderman Meagher admired 0.8.’s
“public spirit” and hoped “his expedition would
prove of benefit to the Empire.” To which I would
only remark that I heard Mr. Bainbridge lecture (if
this is the same Oliver) once in Sydney, and his
deliverance was pretty dreadful. I think he was just
going to begin his adventurous career then by walk-
ing from Sydney to Brisbane or Kyogle or some-
where ; anyhow he was going to walk. I never heard
of his books, and I can’t find him in Who’s Who,
but perhaps mine is an old edition. If he has trav-
elled 300,000 miles, let alone the “upwards,” in 20
years he has averaged 15,000 miles a year, or more
than 41 miles a day; and if he spent every second
day writing books and lecturing, the pace in between
books must have been 82 miles per day. That is
more than easy, if one follows the stodgy routes by
train and. steamboat ; but, a man who'gets into wild,
roadless places per hoof, camel, mule, ox-waggon,
horse, tame elephant, dog-team, catamaran, flying
wombat (I think that was Louis de Rougemont’s
vehicle), wheelbarrow pushed by Chinaman or on
nigger-back can’t possibly do it. I trust Oliver
Bainbridge isn’t going to visit all the Pacific Islands,
for they are a vast collection, and some of them
are too small to ,hold an “expedition.” What science
he specially pursues doesn’t seem to be stated; it
may be political economy or phlebotomy, or some-
thing. I haven’t an idea what he expects to find in
the rather well-trodden Pacific Islands beyond what
has been already found by the explorer, missionary-
trader, beachcomber, concession-hunter, guano-hunter,
sandal-wood seeker, pearler, miscellaneous wild-
catter, outlaw, blackbirder, cheap pirate, botanist,
planter, consul, naval policeman, Burns-Philp em-
ployee, peripatetic novelist, and the man who sells
you your steamboat ticket, to say nothing of the
person with a cough who is recuperating. As for
developing our stupendous resources —well, if the
leader of the expedition stops to do that with the
body and tail of the expedition eating its head off
all the time, expenses will run up. Speaking of
expeditions, there was a time when Sydney was regu-
larly visited by people who were walking round the
world for a prize of 20,000 dollars offered by the
well-known Philander Q. Springbuffer of New York.
I had the chance to tell some of them that they
were off the track. Walking round the world obvi-
ously meant doing the biggest possible part of the
earth’s circumference on foot. Therefore the route,
after leaving Phineas Q. Springbuffer, was from New
York to Alaska, across Behring Strait, and then
westward ami south-westward to Senegal (Africa).
No walking-round-the-world expedition can possibly
take in Australia. One of these dusty pedestrians
really got a mayoral reception. Their particular
branch of industry seems to be extinct. I fancy
Phineas Q. Springbuffer must be dead. He was a
good soul, and always willing to encourage a young
traveller with long legs and a long tale.

APRIL’S in the windy skies,
Reeds are fluting near;
Here are playthings for your
eyes,
Pleasures for your ear.
Day is waking in the glade
Mazed amid the grass;
Nodding flower and shaken blade
Say the fairies pass.
April sun is o’er the land
Like a yellow glove;
Warmer than your lily hand,
Cooler than my love.
Little fellow, let us play
With a merry lip,
For to-day’s the fairer day
For our fellowship.
April air will kiss you full
On your pretty face;
You will feel the fairies pull
At your slipper-lace.
Lightly will they lure your feet
Over many a mile.
Dearie, living will be sweet
For a little while.

We shall have the day
When we have together found
Where the fairies play.
It shall be.-our very own—
Ours to have and hold —
Glowing like a wonder-stone

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
IT was a beautiful sunny morning after
a night of snow when Trooper Burke
rode out of Mole Creek township. The
limbs of the trees and the boughs of the scrub
were all weighed down with glittering bal-
dens. Now and then a limb would release its
load and fly up with a swish as the snow slid
to the ground with a soft thud. Now a
then a troop of black jays flew away with
harsh, clanging cries. These were almost
the only sounds to be heard save hose
the rider made: an occasional creak ot
the saddle or jingle of the bit and the horsey
footsteps, which sounded haidly at all,
muffled were they with snow.
A beautiful morning for a tup. ™

nothing lubricates the thinking apparatus
like a whiff of tobacco smoke, he set his pipe
between his teeth while he chipped up
the weed to fill it. As soon as the pipe was
drawing nicely he began to think again.
He lfad been ordered to go up and search
the country at the headwaters ot the Meisey
River for unlicensed hunters snaring 01
Crown land. That was all in a days work.
Though he had little sympathy with the game
laws, it was part of his duty to see they were
not broken. It is hard to be m sympathy
with laws when all your neighbors are break-
ing them, more or less. He had mid recol-
lections of the big landowner at the footcfl

had a license to catch trout. And now and
then, when he caught some and had them
lined for breaking the game laws, the* v ould
imagine that he had a down on them.
He had caught Ted Casey and had him
convicted and fined for spear mg the
spawning trout, which came up .
creek that runs into one of the lakes. A fcn
months afterwards he had him convicted
again for being in possession of seven kanga-
roo skins during the close season. 1
penalty this time was a pound a skin ancl
thirty shillings costs, or three months im
prisonment. Casey had let him.elf b
away to the cell swearing that he would take
the time out, and when he caught Tioopei
Burke alone in the bush he would shoot him.
Burke had gone to Father Maloney an
given him a pound towards the fine. I athei
Maloney collected the balance in a couple of
hours, paid it in, and Casey was released.
He called Father Maloney a f o°l for hm
fains, told several people about Deloia:in
Ihat he would shoot Burke at the fust oppoi
■unity, and left for the mountains.
I That was the trouble. Burke knew, if he
Slid his duty properly, somewhere between
|-lartnel-’s Falls and the Du Cave Range lie
fvould catch Casey snaring kangaroo, and
f 'asev had taken out no hunter s license—m
fact, he expected to find Casey s slab dij mg
shed full of kangaroo-skins. Then he sup-
posed there would be trouble. . . . He knocked
his pipe out, put it in his pocket, and quick-
ened his horse. He had a gallop across a
grassy plain, almost like a lake in the sm-
rounding bush, with little islands o ’
dotted about in it. A kangaroo making
heavy going in the soft snow, he chase
it, and a great flurry flew out behind
at every hop—a lot of work for very little
I)a The trooper was now getting well up
towards the mountains —Cradle Mount and
Barn Bluff in the distance to the. right,
Pelion East and Pelion West closer m, the
Du Cave Range right in front.
He dropped into the valley wheie the
little Arm River joins the Mersey and
travelled up beside the river. The Mersey

in the bottom of a wide valley which runs
parallel wfith the rugged mountain. e
boiled his billy and gave the horse a teed at
the foot of a pretty little fall.
He reached old Tom’s hut, where lie in-
tended to stop the night, just at dusk. J-hiee
big cattle-dogs—Smithfield, with a dash ot
bulldog—greeted him. Old Tom called them
off. _ „ ,
"Put your horse in the stable. Pull down
an armful of that clover hay and give 1
him,” said Old Tom as he turned into the

he said, and added, as a sort of
afterthought • “Nothin’ like the clover that

nothing: “Purdy seen the wild man last week

Streak, the biggest of the huge halt-bied
dogs, flopped his tail and looked up as much
as to say, “With pleasure.”
In the morning Burke was packing his
swag—cutting out as much weight as possi-
ble, as he was leaving his horse. He passed
old Tom a bundle of papers with the remark
that there was something tor him to read.
“Nothin’ like a bit of readin to pass the
time o’ nights,” said Tom. Then just as
Burke was leaving he said: Do you know
Casey says he will shoot you first time fie
sees you in these parts?”
“Yes,” said Burke.
“Got your revolver handy ?
Burke pulled his revolver out of his
pocket, cocked it and uncocked it, spun the
cylinder round with his thumb and then
tossed it into the bunk with the things he
was leaving behind. .
“Since you remind me, I won t take it.
When people have been talking about shoot-
ing, these things are liable to go off too
easily.”
“Well, so-long,” said Tom, and stood look-
ing after him till he was out of sight.
It was warm walking, with forty pounds
of swag up, in spite of the snow. Burke
passed two or three mobs of big Hereford
cattle —wild as hawks, but as inquisitive S 3
little children about anyone on foot. His
track was now up the side of the valley away
from the river and towards a button-grass
plateau running right to the foot of the Du
Cave Range. The morning sun lit up the big |
fluted columns of basalt that rose for hun-
dreds of feet so clear and straight that only
a ledge or a crack here and there had caught
a pocket of snow. At mid-day he boiled
his billy on the plateau.
When working north, soon afterwards, he
came across footprints in the snow that soon
led him to a line of springers, with plenty
of signs about them of recent catches of kan-
Several times he had a feeling as though
li° were being followed, and began to wish
old Tom hadn’t mentioned the wild man lasi
night; also to be half doubtful whether he
should have left his revolver behind. He
could neither see nor hear anything, but the
idea that he was followed grew to a certainty j
—why, he could not tell. Once, after crossing
a little clear patch, he crouched down in the
scrub the other side and waited. In a
couple of minutes a big native tiger came
to the edge of the clear space and looked
across; then, instead of crossing the open
ground, slunk round the edge of the scrub.
After that Burke dismissed the matter from
his mind. , ,
Late in the afternoon he climbed some
granite rocks that were outcropping above
the plateau, to get a view of the locality,
Suddenly his foot slipped on a piece of iced
rock, and he fell on to a ledge, where he lay
on the snow.
The next thing he knew was that some
one was giving him a drink from his own
flask. It was Ted Casey. Burke found
that his swag had been unwrapped and he
was lying on his blankets under the shelter
of the rock. . _ ~ T ,,
“I suppose you remember that 1 said I d
shoot vou if you came up this way?” said
Casey. “Well, I won't have to now. 1 11
■just find you accidentally in the morning.
That is, what is left of you. I scared away
a couple of ‘tigers’ as I came along and there
are always plenty of them ‘devils and native
cats, who follow my tracks round for the
carcases. They will attend to the matter
for me. Nice job they make, picking a
skeleton, too.” ...
“Do you intend to leave me here like
this?” said Burke. .
“Of course I do, till the morning. Pleas-
ant night,” and Casey strolled away.
Sunset came to make the mountains blos-
som as a rose. Purple shadows climbed out
of the hollows aiid up the hillside. A night
wind that cut like a blade of ice flew across
the plateau, but Burke was sheltered from
the worst of it by the rocks. _
He examined himself and discovered his
right thigh and right wrist broken. He began
to speculate on his chance of wriggling or
crawling down to old Tom’s hut ten miles
by the shortest route, much further by the
way he had come.
His speculation was broken oft by the
sight of a tiger-cat sitting watching him ten
yards away. Burke shuffled round until h<
was sitting with his back against the rocks.
He would face the beast whatever happened.
He began to recollect all the tales lie had
heard about tigers and devils: the devil
whose head seemed to be all mouth and teeth
and who hung on like a bulldog once he got
a grip. And how they and tigers would
trail one particular kangaroo all night,
never losing the scent no matter how many
others had crossed the trail, until at last
they sprang for its throat. He shivered at
the* thought, shuffled his muffler up into a
pad at his throat, and buttoned his coat
over it.
Presently he noticed the cat get up and
slink away. Was the wild man having a
stroll around? He would welcome the com-
pany of the wildest man after the creatures
who had been hanging about.
A light like a lost star appeared down
the hillside. It flickered in and out among
the bushes, and then he heard a voice call-
ing to a horse. In a few minutes Ted
Casey was alongside him with an old brown
pi-acl harnessed to a home-made sledge.
Ho had brought some pieces of paling

Tom Tuft’s Cure.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
TIIE seven horses, galloping as if they
liked it, drew the coach swiftly over
the rolling downs.
‘lt s the kind of day that makes a man
want to live for ever, Jim,” said I. as the
wind changed with sunrise from west to east,
and a few thousand galahs tinged the tur-
quoise sky with moving slate and cerise as
the sun caught their wings and breasts.
“It’s a bad thing to want to live for ever,”
h<' replied, holding the brake lightly so that
the sever horses tore down the banks of a
creek an< rushed up the other side, pushed
by the weight of the coach.
“If you take your chance, the chances are
you will live longer than the chap who’s
always scared that there’s a plot fixed up to
make him an angel quick. Anyhow, you live
as long as you don’t think of dying. Look at
the age these saints and parsons live to
lhats because they think death and repent-
ance are only for the congregation. Thev
believe they’re going to be the last on earth
anyway. You get plenty of big, strong chaps
you couldn’t kill unless you sharpened the
ax ?.' an .’ they’re always frightened o’ dying.”
“Which one particularly?”
“Well, all of them. The last was Tom
Tuft. He was a bushman, packing water he
was as lean as one of his packhorses, and
made himself leaner by turning druggist. lie
lived on hard beef and hard johnny-cakes—
bread that would turn the edge of a razor.
He didn’t go on a jag like a Christian once
a year—not with hard stuff anyhow. But he
got an idea that the human constitution
demanded pills instead of sherbet, and he
swallowed all the drugs in the British Cornu-
copia. W henever he made a township Tom
would pull up at the store and interview the
storekeeper, as solemn as a Seventh Day
gravedigger.
“ ‘Now, Mister,’ Tom would say, ‘gimme
one gross Epsom Salts, two dozen Painkiller,
fourteen pound linseed-meal, two dozen
porous plasters, one dozen bottles Toody’s
Lickser of Death or something, two dozen
boxes Quogpigge’s Pills, six bottles of New-
monia Cough Cure, three dozen Pleurer Pow-
ders, and one dozen Ilurryup Tonic.’ Then
he’d look at the list again and see if he’d
forgot anything. Then he’d say as an after-
thought : ‘Oh, an’ give me a hundred o’ flour,
an’ six tins o’ butter, an’ a seventy o’ sugar,
an three dozen assorted meat, an’ a pound
o’ onions.’
“And he’d get the lot and refresh himself
on a bromo quinine at the chemist’s, and
back he’d go to his camp a hundred mile
back all good and happy, and you’d see him
there at a little copper-mine whistling ‘A
i lower from My Angel Mother’s Grave,’
quite cheerful and contented because he knew
he had enough medicine in the meat-safe to
ast him a month. It was a terrible habit of
Ins—worse than tapping palms and letting
the juice stand in the sun and ferment, and
then having a jamboree on your lonely own.
HeM start with Epsom and a nip of Pain-
killer at eleven, half a pannikin of Toody’s
Lickser of Death or something before cr'ib-
time, Newmonia Cough Cure in the after-
noon, _ and a Pleurer Powder an’ linseed-meal
poultices before turning in. When the back
of his camp was stacked with medicine-
bottles, and there were so many pill-boxes
that they rattled against the dead sticks
whenever the plain winds blew, he had been
at the game for seven years and he wasn’t
feeling too good. He couldn’t fix himself on
any one. disease, and he tried to invent one
to take m all the symptoms he had. Some of
the symptoms were Painkiller, and lie called
that lot Granulated Ophthalmia; and an-
other symptom was Toody’s Lickser of Death
or something, and he called that Nervous
Ability; and other symptoms were Ilurryup
lonic, and he called that Palpitation of the
f luck. And all he did was to try other drug-
gist stuff—lpecacuanha and Bacteria and
tilings like that; and the pile of bottles grew
so that it was near as big as his camp, and
the. pill-boxes chased each other over the
plains whenever there was a fair wind.
“He was feeling pretty bad, as he ought to
do, suffering from complication of diseases,
loody s Lickser and Pleurer Powders, but he
was a obstinit man, and he says: ‘l’ll beat
her, or she’ll beat me,’ and he went on. He
had every new medicine that was advertised,
and through taking ’em all he got all the
diseases they was advertised to cure. He
didn’t hold with doctors, and he was right
enough there, because most of them are
frauds, and if you’re sick you mostly cure
yourself, and if you can’t cure yourself you
soon belong to ‘ln Memoriam’ and ‘A Patient
Sufferer at Rest,’ and you’re a banished hand
and you’re voice isn’t shrill any more. xVt
long last a mate of his put a real doctor on
to him, and this man was one of the few
doctors that know, the others being half the
sort that treat you for bronchitis when
you’ve got ingrowing toenails, and half the
sort that want to explore your appendix
with a saw when your trouble is sherbet out
of a black bottle.
“This chap told Tom to get into hospital.
So Tom waited to get half a coachload of
tonics and prophylactics and dramaturgists
or something, and he rode into the township
and took the train and goes down the line
to hospital. He thought it was Heaven for
a bit. They gave him better-cooked stuff
than he ever had before, and the nurses used
to hold his hand and sing hymns to put him
to sleep, and he was feeling pretty good.
Then one day they brought in a tough well
known in every mining camp in the Gulf —-
a bad man, name of Speewaa Hick. What
with the nurses and the attention and the
good tucker Tom felt that he’d soon lose his
chronic pneumonia, and when Speewaa Hick
began to look so bad that the wardsman
talked of getting the screen ready to put
around his bed, Tom cheered up a lot. He
says to the prettiest nurse: ‘That’ll show
you what a good life means. I’ve been a
good, sober man all my life and kept my
health with plenty o’ medicine—Toody’s
Lickser of Heath and Hurryup Tonic —and
that chap. Speewaa Hick, he’s chewed up bar
counters, and now he’s down and out.’ The
nurse tells Tom that if he’s a good boy they’ll
grant him pratique inside of a month, and
then she says: ‘Now I’ve got, to go and give
Speewaa Hick his medicine.’
“That started Tom thinking, and the more
he thought the sicker he got. They hadn’t
given him any medicine, and when he got
a sly look into the locker he saw that they
had taken away the Lickser of Heath and
the Pleurer Powders and all the rest of his
home comforts. He waited a day, and he
thought over things, and he saw them give
Speewaa medicine every two hours. Twelve
times a day Speewaa got medicine good
and plenty, but when Tom got there the
cupboard was bare, and so poor Tom got
none.
“So he kicked—first to the prettiest nurse,
and she held his hand and patted it;
and then to the Wowser one, and she held
his hand and sung a hymn; and then to
the nasty one, and she called him Tuft and
told him not to be silly. He passed the
kick on to the doctor and argued with him
as man to man.
“ ‘Here I am,' Tom said. ‘Led a good
life, never_ and what's my reward?
I get nothing, and Speewaa. who never did
a decent day’s work since he was foaled —
never earned a fiver—he lives on the fat o’
the land—medicine.’ says Tom, ‘twelve
times a day, and you give me brasher.’
“The doctor argues with him. tells him
it’s all for his own good; btit 'Tom Tuft’s
like a man getting over the horrors in a
Rechabite home, and he’s so bad he can’t
listen to reason. At last he makes such a
row they let him leave the hospital.
“He came back to Richmond by train
and took the box-seat on the coach. He
had a portmanter and a candle-box and a
mustard-box, and the boxes were pretty
heavy.
“ ‘What have you got in the boxes, Tom?'
I said. ‘Broken Hill? They’re heavy
enough to be lead.’
“ ‘They’re Toody’s Lickser,’ he says, ‘an’
Ilurryup Tonic, an’ a new thing I heard of
—jus’ come out—-Pyrogallic Acid and Hypo-
phosuhones,’
“As we go along be tells tab hdw they
mistreated him ill the hospital, and how he
nearly died, and escaped just iti time, and
how Speewaa got all the favoritism, arid
him that had always lived a decent, sober
jife left with his tongue hanging out Starv-
ing for a pill an’dyin’ of the craving fbr
a good tonic. He was bitter, btit there
Were tears in his eyes when he told of the
cruelty at the hospital. ‘But nOw,’ he ShyS,
‘l’m a mail again’ ; and he takes a bottle
o’ the Lickser o’ Death or something Hut
of his pocket and swigs it. ‘That’s the
stuff,’ he says, and then he gets quiet and
dozes a bit. While we were changing
teams he had some Painkiller because of
the savage treatment he got at the starva-
tion hospital, and on we went again.
“We were 22 miles out of Richmond when
he gasps, and I looked at him and see he's
white about the gills. Bimeby he looks so
bad that t pulled tip, and aS soon as 1
stopped the horses he fell forward, and Only
my arm was in front of him he’d have fell
down among the wheelers’ hoofs. I tied
the reins around the brake, and another chap
gave me a hand lifting hint off the. Coach,
and we put him down among the Mitchell
grass, and 1 held up his head—because I
see he’s ready to deliver his waybill
“ ‘l’m pretty bad,’ he says. 'All along of
that dam’ hospital jewin’ a poor bioke Hut
of his medicine.’
“I thought it was his last gasp, and I
was so sorry tO see poor old Tom, at Head
Finish that I was near cryin’, but i coughed
instead.
“He roused himself up at that and he
says: ‘Jim!’ he sayS, ‘feel irt my pocket—
the coat.’
“I feels in his pocket and I brings Out a
bottle of Toody’s Lickser of Death or some-
thing and holds it Up. ‘That’s it, Jim,’ he
says. 'We been good friends, Jim. an’
you’ve jot a dam’ bad cold, Jim,’ he says.
‘Take Toody’s Licksef—it cured me.’
“An’ with that he goes heavy on my arm
an’ died. Poor old Tofn! That’S Where
he’s buried On the next rise. We had a
posLmOrtuis nisey-bonum on him aiid the
Verdict Was ‘Acute Medicine Poisonin’.’ ”
“And Speewaa?”
“Committed for trial for attempted
suicide. It took three policemen to get the
razor from him.”

u Nerves”
Oar nerves are similar to an intri-
cate network of telegraph wires.
Controlled and-nourished by a
portion of the brain —known as
the nerve centres—-the delicate
threadlike nerves radiate in all
directions throughout the body.
So long as the nerve centres are
capable of continually supplying
nourishment to the nerves, the
nerves will remain strong and
healthy. But directly the nerve
centres become weakened by
overwork, worry or anxiety, they
are unable to transmit the
necessary nourishment, and the
nerves become worn out and
“on edge.” Then it is that a sud-
den sound makes you “jump”

Tbc jVledictnc for You
must possess certain advantages without which it would hardly commend
itself to your confidence. It must be perfectly safe under all circumstances-
It must be mild in its action but none the less efficacious on that account.
It must be, par excellence, a family medicine, that is, suitable for
old and young of both sexes and be freely obtainable in town or
country. It must be easy to take, regular and reliable in its curative
effects and possess a great and genuine record of success. Such a
medicine is Beecham’s Pills which still hold, and will continue to hold,
the highest position in popular favour. It is very interesting, after so
many years service, still to find Beecham’s Pills “at the top of the
tree” among digestive remedies. They ar' everywhere acknowledged
to be unrivalled in the treatment of such troubles as biliousness, sick
headache, heartburn, constipation, giddiness, failing appetite, poorness
of blood and a general run-down condition. If you are in any way a
sufferer from digestive ailments take
Bcgcham’s fills
BEECHAM'S PILLS are specially suitable hr females o! all ages.
